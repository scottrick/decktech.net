<blockquote><font class="bfont"> VIPER GETS POINTS BACK - Phoenix, 6/22/01<br>
<br>
I built a Xizor dark deck the other week, and I’ve been dying to try it out. I’ve never seen or played this decktype since Tatooine came out, so this was really new for me. It performed EXTREMELY well in playtesting, only losing 1 game to QMC mains (QMC got a GOD draw, my hand was 8 red cards). I was confident with the deck, but I still had doubts about the night. I played it anyway, and used QMC mains (16-2 in playtesting, 0-4 in tournament play) because I need at least 1 win before tearing it apart for scout podracing (Go, SpeedRacer!). I get my newbie padawan Grayson, but Levi can’t go. We get there around 7:00 (the time it’s supposed to start), Jared helps me decide on a couple LS changes to make my space stronger, and I gave Grayson my "Tracking in 5 seconds" seminar as the tournament started. ;-) They turned on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on random scene selection while we were playing and changed it to A New Hope when Crouching Tiger was finished, and I think it distracted Grayson during his games. Not good for a person just learning how to play. My rating going into this is 1727.<br>
<br>
DS: Agents Of The Dark Sun w/out podracing<br>
LS: QMC Mains that MUST WIN!<br>
<br>
GAME 1: LS vs. Grayson’s old-skool high destiny Hunt Down w/ duelling (1459)<br>
<br>
He decided the previous day that he didn’t like the Royal Guard swarm, so I threw this together in about 5 minutes. It’s been awhile since I’ve played duelling hunt down, so it was missing a few key components (No Escape, characters, little things like that). It’s still a strong deck, but it could be a lot better. He got all over my deck really early with Direct Damage from Visage and drains from Mara with her stick (both in starting hand, but no Vader) at Leia’s Hutt. I had no choice but to take it and eventually dropped down EPP Obi and Jedi Luke for the flip 4th turn. I had a smoke screen in hand as I moved Obi to Mara’s site. Luke moved over to the "cancel drains" site. Vader and Tarkin come down on Luke and initiate, and I Weapon Lev Vader’s stick away out of fear of duelling. Turns out he didn’t have obession anyway, so it didn’t matter (except Luke wasn’t hit). Luke lives, and I lose 3 cards. Tarkin goes away to Smoke Screen, which he can’t cancel. ;-) That’s tech. Mara battles Obi at the same tim; we hit each other, and the site is cleared as I lose 4 cards. Notice that I’m losing cards and he’s only losing characters - he’s winning this game. We can’t have any of that.<br>
<br>
Visage is a thorn in my side. It’s hurting him too, but he’s got more cards than I do so it’s hurting me more. Corran Horn shuts down the hologram for good, and now I’ve got a solid drain for 2. Tycho is holding space for me, so I’ve got another drain. I keep Luke at the drain-cancelling site and spread my army on the other side of Cloud City for more drains. He loses his duelling cards to drains off the top, and I can play a little safer now. He plays Bossk but can’t initiate, so I have the Home One join the party and beat him up real good. I finally get the upper hand against my apprentice and drain him out.<br>

2 (+25)<br>
<br>
The Good: The deck won, cheesy as it was. Coming from behind to win with this deck against Hunt Down is cool.<br>
The Bad: This deck needs Honor!<br>
The Ugly: If his deck had more characters and less crap, he would have taken the game.<br>
Props To Opponent: I have never seen anyone pick up the game as quickly as Grayson has. A little experience and a couple tracking lessons, and this is a 12-year-old to watch out for. Dude is good.<br>
<br>
So that’s good - I can finally destroy this pile, and I’m in first so far. I’m playing Shaner next unless someone wins by a lot, and I really hope someone wins by a lot. I know what Shaner can do to Xizor decks... ;-)<br>
<br>
GAME 2: DS vs. Jonathan Dunn’s Hidden Mains (1796)<br>
<br>
Luckily for me, Dunn won the game by more than Shaner. Gee, oh boy. I have a character in my hand, so I deploy Presence Of The Force, drop Aurra, and move Xizor for the turn 1 flip. I check the top card of his deck - It’s Jedi Luke. Great. As fate would have it, he checked his deck for Generals before he activated, forcing him to shuffle his deck before he activated the Jedi I hate so much. Sweet! He gets out Endor and the Falcon, then I get to drain for 1 and do a little damage. He has to lose a card off the top of his deck, and he predicts it will be a Luke. Lo and behold, he was right! Okay, 1 down 1 to go, I’m guessing. He drops down some characters in front of Aurra Sing, Xizor, and a couple other random scrubs and battles. Weapon Lev so Sing has Obi’s saber - sense. Oh Switch Off to protect Guri - sense. Presence Of The Force gets an Alter to finish the barrage of SAC he’s got in his hand. Sucks to be me now. I keep trying to Twi’lek for my There Is No Try, but it keeps getting sensed! Ben found his Journal, and he chased me around with his wookiee friend, Luke, and Qui-Gon. I can’t find my ships, so I’m screwed anyway, and to top it off, I can’t find my key characters. I finally find my Bossk and put him at an unoccupied Tatooine system for a drain of 2, but that pesky Falcon comes over to stop all that. Damn Lando. I battle him to avoid the beatdown I know is coming next turn and only lose Bossk. I miss his immunity, so he stays intact. I draw a card - Lateral Damage. DOH!!! His Journal, sabers, and I’ll Take The Leader do quick work of me draining me out. My 2nd to last card lost was There Is No Try, of course. That was the only time I would see it all game.<br>

2 (+2)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: I started really good, then he took his second turn.<br/>
The Bad: I should have known to start TINT against Dunn. He’s the reason the card is in the deck.<br/>
The Ugly: He just owned me the entire game.<br/>
Props To Opponent: Dunn takes the crap I dish out all game long, even when I’m losing horribly. He’s always fun to play against (and lose to).<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I had played Shaner now. ;-) Anyway, it’s a fun time, and the movie has switched to A New Hope finally. Girard and others are naming every card as it appears in the film, but that’s really not as entertaining until everyone is really, REALLY drunk. It’s just better that way. I get all upset when they miss Alterternatives To Fighting, and we start the 3rd game.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: DS vs. Ryan Hamre’s EBO w/ Podracing (1481)<br/>
<br/>
I have never seen this decktype AT ALL until this game. I saw Choongie using a variant of it, but he does all sorts of weird (yet effective) stuff, so I wasn’t expecting to see it from other players. Ryan placed really high this tournament, and his rating is gonna soar from the people he defeated. I gave up my ratings points, too. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My first race destiny was a 6, so I thought I might leave it there just in case. This is a fairly high destiny Agents deck, so with a little tracking, I might just do well. I do my direct damage and drains, but he wins the race quickly. I lose 5, and he retrieves his Lost Pile. Xizor dies to Obi for the flip. I activate an unholy amount of Force, use a bunch to deploy my scrubs, and draw until I’ve got 12, leaving 1 Force in my Force Pile. He drains for 1, I lose it from that pile. Xizor. Great, now my objective isn’t coming back. He keeps inserting AFA into my deck to either keep my activation low or push the 4 card loss. I’ve got the characters and cards, I just don’t have anyone to battle against. I should have added a Projective. Now I’m going to. I drop Fett against a Lateral Damaged Home One and battle at Hoth, he loses a couple cards. He drops the Liberty with Ha’ashhn aboard, cancelling Lateral Damage, and beats the holy hell out of Fett for the game.<br/>

2 (-15)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: My first race destiny was a 6. That’s about it.<br/>
The Bad: Losing to AFA, the race, eating an EBO drain (once), and all that crap.<br/>
The Ugly: Losing to the guy I taught how to track. ;-)<br/>
Props To Opponent: You could tell Ryan didn’t want to beat me, or at least he didn’t enjoy owning me as badly as he did. Another fun player who has really picked up my tracking strategies well.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Tatoo-AntiViper-ine is making its mark. This is the third time in a row I’ve really taken it badly. I’m expecting another 1-3 day, and to top it off, my last game is gonna suck.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: LS vs. Chris Shaner’s This Deal (1954)<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, Shaner. Just who I wanted to play against. My QMC has yet to lose to this deck in playtesting, but we all know how my playtesting went. My only other sanctioned matchup like this was against Pat, and he took me by 12. If I hadn’t made a poor mistake, he would have beat me by 1. I guess we’ll see. If I cared about my Decipher rating, I would have probably quit the game by now. tee hee<br/>
<br/>
My starting hand consists of 6 red cards and a pair of sabers. Okay, like this game wasn’t bad enough already. I activate, find a site, and draw 3 cards - Obi, Chewie, and Wedge. SWEET!!!!! I flip 2 turns later. He gets CC Occupation, but I only lose 1 Force to it, and it only happens a few turns. I keep killing his characters as soon as they hit the table. He NEVER got Dark Deal on the table - he just lost it to a drain. Too bad - that card is the only way he could have beat me, I think. He drops Zuckuss down against Chewie and the Falcon (Red Squad 1 wasn’t in the deck), 4LOM is aboard, and he decides to add Jabba for another destiny. We ALL have a good laugh about that one (meaning everyone in the room at the time), and Shaner knows it probably cost him everything. He beats up my Falcon, Chewie covers. He gets the drain of 1 (his system) uncontested for awhile. Whatever. I’m beating him up at the sites, so I can take the 1 right now. Path is absolutely wrecking his plans. He eventually catches it, but the damage was done. I also try a Lift Tube Escape to track a 5, but he catches that, too. That was probably the best thing to happen all game, allowing my Off The Edges to run wreak havoc the rest of the game. I found a pair of destiny 6s I liked and retrieved with them 4 times in all. No battles were too special, as nothing major happened. We deployed, we battled, we died, mine came back. He moved Zuckuss to the clouds to try and land to get Jabba and 4LOM out, but I found Cappy Han and took out Cloud City Occupation with the still-floating Falcon. We ran around the system and sector a few times, and late game I let him battle, knowing Han’s forfeit would cover any possible overflow. I drained him out on the ground.<br/>

4(+1)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: I beat Shaner! That’s 2-0 in sanctioned play, people!<br/>
The Bad: If he got Dark Deal off, even once, it would have been game.<br/>
The Ugly: I won by 16 because I retrieved 20. That’s cool.<br/>
Props To Opponent: Shaner is a good guy and takes losing well. He’s a good winner and a good loser - that’s an often-overlooked quality of a great player. This game was fun.<br/>
<br/>
So I manage to finish 2-2 with a positive dif. That’s the best I’ve done since this set came out. I’m happy that I got a few ratings points back, even if they were at Shaner’s expense. I figure the win against him balanced the loss to Ryan, and the win vs. Grayson took care of most of the loss to Dunn. My rating isn’t going anywhere. Here are your scores:<br/>
<br/>
1: Jonathan Dunn @ 8 (+68)<br/>
2: Mike Clement @ 6 (+57)<br/>
3: DJ Andrews @ 6 (+35)<br/>
4: Pat Hug<br/>
5: Ryan Hamre<br/>
6: Steve Marshall (me)<br/>
12: Grayson Graves<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
* Jared and the Outer Rim for hosting the event<br/>
* Grayson for coming to another tournament<br/>
* Me for finally winning a couple games<br/>
* Dunn for helping me with a DS deck that needed it<br/>
* Juz Pakes for the good Tremor ruling!<br/>
* Ryan for breaking top 5 and beating me. Way to go!<br/>
* Girard for helping out Grayson instead of just beating the living crap out of him last game.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
* Playing the movie, which distracted my new player a bit. I know, I’m really stretching for slops now.<br/>
* Big D for the Dagobah errata (check the CRD)<br/>
* Big D for the Projective Telepathy errata<br/>
* Big D for the JPSD sealed rules<br/>
* Big D for the Cappy Han errata (check the Reflections version - NOT in the CRD)<br/>
* Big D for the Fett’s Blaster errata (check the Reflections version - NOT in the CRD)<br/>
* Big D for the Don’t Get @#$%y errata (only works on TIE/ln. Did you know that? I didn’t)<br/>
* Big D for the Repeating Blaster / free ruling - I know it’s broken, but say it in the cards, not the CRD.<br/>
* Big D for making changing card game text (which is an errata) and calling it a "clarification"<br/>
<br/>
Please just let us know when you’re changing the cards like this! I hope that message gets heard. Anyway, thanks for reading (and for putting up with my constructive criticism / ranting)! I appreciate your comments as always. Until next game,<br/>
<br/>
