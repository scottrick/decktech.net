<br>
Director’s Report:<br>
<br>
Well, at long last I hear that people are playing in our area again, so I post a tournament at my old hangout.  After getting a few emails from folks I expected about 14-16 people, but as I arrived and people were checking in, I found out that Ray Bordier had a prior commitment (even though he and his lovely wife and daughter stopped by to say hi) and Kim Caton had been in a car accident the night before (she is OK, but angry that she missed my triumphant return to RPG).  Dan Bordier also stopped by after the tourney had started, but could only stay for a few games and decided not to play. There were 9 other gamers, including a few first timers to our store, and Pat Ziagos and Frank Walsh from Clarks-Summit.  Joey G. had baseball practice so we had a very quiet day.<br>
<br>
This was the first tournament I was eligible to play in <br>
since the change that directors could play.  Patrick was my<br>
counterpart, but we really had no major rules difficulties,<br>
even though we both forgot how to do an attack run.  I <br>
realized at 11pm last night that I should look at my R2 and<br>
my existing decks in the event I might play.  A few changes <br>
were made and away we went.<br>
<br>
My Decks:  DS:  Big Pete’s Revenge (some combo swapouts)<br>
	   LS:  Bad EBO Deck (some combo swapouts)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to check out the <br>
various deck types played today.  I usually try to check <br>
them out and list them, but I saw a few people using the<br>
Lar’s combo with Harvest, and a nifty LS "Brangus Glee <br>
Superstar"-like deck with the new character that lets <br>
you swap out docking bays from your lost pile.  I won’t<br>
give details in order to protect that person, though.<br>
There were a few Hunt Down and Scum decks for the DS<br>
too.  There was even an Ewok deck and a stormtrooper<br>
"trooper assault" deck.  Some pretty ingenious combos<br>
for sure!<br>
<br/>
After 2 games, Pat, Frank, Kevin, and myself were all 2-0.<br/>
I played Pat, losing by 30, and Kevin beat Frank by 15.  I<br/>
ended up beating Frank (mostly because of lonely Leia) by<br/>
16, and Patrick beats Kevin by 33.  Game 5 has the 4 of<br/>
us swapping sides, and Frank beats me by 22 and Pat loses<br/>
by 10.  At this point, Michael E. and Steve have crept up <br/>
to 3 wins and have the potential to sneak into a placing<br/>
position.  For the top 4 players, the last game ends up <br/>
being a rematch of game 3.  I play my DS against Pat and <br/>
Frank plays his LS against Kevin.  If Pat has the lead on <br/>
differential, but if he loses and Kevin wins, then it is<br/>
Kevin’s Tournament.  Kevin ands up beating Frank by 8.<br/>
Pat and I are the last game playing with about 10 minutes<br/>
to go.  <br/>
<br/>
We had both started with Careful Planning/Combat<br/>
Readiness on our respective planets:  him Tattooine, me<br/>
Hoth.  We spent a few turns activating and drawing, with<br/>
me getting the lead on twix locations.  He plays Ben at<br/>
the Hut with Corran, and I nonchalantly deploy and move<br/>
4Lom with rifle to the Lars farm to the Hut.  He is <br/>
puzzled, but during his next turn I disarm him after the<br/>
force drain.  He is angry, yet more puzzled.  He has<br/>
C3PO at the farm, and is HDWGITM often, also he is OOC’ing<br/>
my lost pile at an annoying rate.  Next turn I get DLOTS<br/>
and Saber and GM Tarkin down at the Farm, move them to <br/>
the Hut, then Circle Obi.  He gets EPP Luke and Lars<br/>
Combo to the Farm, pulls off a Harvest, and we continue<br/>
to pound each other into oblivion.  Later in the game, I<br/>
get Kashyyyk and Endor out, and he has no space to counter.<br/>
He manages to OOC Mara and Tarkin (frikkin lucky!!) but I<br/>
have more characters and more drains and outlast him to <br/>
win by 13.<br/>
<br/>
Final Standings:<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Elia         10(42)<br/>
Patrick Ziagos      8(70)<br/>
Steve Skilton       8(57)<br/>
Michael Eustice     8(28)<br/>
