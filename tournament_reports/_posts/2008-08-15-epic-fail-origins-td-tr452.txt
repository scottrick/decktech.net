<blockquote><font class="bfont"> ___________back out___________<br>
so basically the week of origins i had 5 people i was counting on showing up back out.  reid had just gotten back from a vacation, plus was going through <br>
swccg burn-out which we all experience from time to time.  i talked with him a little about the possibility of him judging the event, but ultimately just <br>
stayed home.  mike richards decided that west nats in vegas was more appealing, also cited the lackluster meta as not very inticing to players who are <br>
looking to travel for swccg.  greg shaw and taco bill didnt have gas money, which is understandable, as 4 dollar gas is hella bootleg.  mike french has <br>
expressed some interest, but apparently no one was staying in a hotel with room for him, which was kind of a bummer, but hotels are super expensive during <br>
con weekend so its understandable.  anyway, not really ragging on people here, just wanted to mention that we easily could have had 28 or 30 on the weekend.  <br>
<br>
also perhaps to draw a little attention to gas prices making people travel less for swccg- i recommend more 2 day things, like a regional on saturday and a <br>
states or mini open on a sunday.  it cuts travel costs since 1 trip covers 2 events.  also to people in towns where events are, open your doors for out of <br>
towners to stay overnight if they need to.<br>
<br>
<br>
_____thursday (continued)__________<br>
<br>
so here is a fun bonus round story that only adds to the legend of one bradley d eier.  so i'm checking out this both at the con that sells old nintendo <br>
games (btw why are they worth more than what i paid for them 15 years ago?) and whatever and there is this kinda one decent looking chick or whatever so i <br>
start making some small talk about the bible adventure game and like shes basically all in on me but is trying to work so she can't be too rowdy but she is <br>
pretty clever and instead of writing her # down for me, instead she has a business type card with a phone # and an email and leik AIM so instead she just <br>
writes her name on the back of the card.  clutch!  but so then like to wrap up the story the next day she was wearing some strapless thing and idk she had <br>
some skull tattoos that were visible, idk i'm generally all in for chicks w/tattoos but sometimes they are just too ridiculous.  so anyway i just did a move <br/>
like vince vaughn in rounders and ripped up the # after i got it.<br/>
<br/>
oh btw i guess i should note it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to look thru exhibitor rooms.  i cant spend too much time at nate hill's, cause of <br/>
all his swccg i am likely to self destruct and buy a bunch of stuff if i am there too long.  plus now i have to avoide this video game place.  that is in <br/>
addition to avoiding one of the sword blacksmith guys cause one of them is related to some girl i used to see or something.  so anyway basically every con <br/>
hall is a land mine and i have to combine the strategic moves of a general patton with the elusiveness of a barry sanders just to stroll thru the con hall, <br/>
so i can look at sweet booths like the nazi booth, which featured one of the greatest porno titles ever, "gestapo's last orgy".  sadly, it cost 30$ and i <br/>
wasn't willing to pay a dollar over 20 so on the shelf was where that skinematic masterpiece remains.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so the cube event sorta came together really well during the week to 10 days leading up to origins.  i had initially planned a sealed event, but had torubles <br/>
securing product, plus most people wanted cube, and, at the risk of being called a populist (apparently this is a bad thing?) i decided to DO WHAT THE <br/>
PLAYERS WANT.  so then i needed to secure the use of some cubes.  tim simon would bring his, schoe-stopper would bring his, and we would also use the team <br/>
ohio official draft in a box.  i talked with the origins peopel and we were able to move the cube to a 5pm start on friday, making it possible for more <br/>
people to play.  cedric had approved this as a 2 bye event so we decided top light and top dark players each would get a worlds bye.  <br/>
we had 12 people, which is kind of a strange number to work with, as the cube is made for 10 players.  I considered dropping from the event, but we still <br/>
would have 11 people for a cube of 10, and i generally am not one to ask players who paid to get into a con to drop out of an event.  so we decided to have 6 <br/>
players per cube and use 2 cubes: 3 light and 3 dark players per cube.  this was ok, but there are basically two things that come up: 1 is that a lot of the <br/>
power cards dont get drafted, and second is that dark is a little better with less than the full 5 players drafting from a cube.  this is because dark has <br/>
some really good strong cards, then a lot of not so good ones.  with 5 person draft, the good ones are spread out a lot, so dark can maybe hold 1 location <br/>
but is weak elsewhere.  light, on the other hand, has a lot of solid but not amazing cards, so can draft a more solid all around deck even if there are 5 <br/>
people.  with 3 people, dark gets to draft more of these power characters, and is advantaged (in my opinion).  <br/>
i was assigned to dark with a pod of me, justin desai and aaron kingery.  probably one of the toughest drafts i've been in to date, i would pick a card and <br/>
hope another gets back to me and it wouldn't.  i enjoyed the challenge however.  first pick overall was a no brainer, prince xizor.  i also drafted scum pack <br/>
2, but never saw an AC to use it.  i got passed an epp vader which was nifty imho.  i didnt have a ton of space, but it wasnt bad.  a dreadnaught  or two and <br/>
a couple star destroyers.  i had a decent number of pilots so i figured i would be ok.  the general plan was to start the 2/1 drain -1 CC site.  from there i <br/>
could pull either the downtown plaza, or, if the matchup dictated it, sullest, to drain big.  my deck was not the best deck i had ever played, it was missing <br/>
some of the high destiny recyclables i like to use, and i had no starting effect.  i did pull off a few guns for ground, along with hermie odle v and jodo <br/>
kast.  someone took the defeisive fire v i had hoped would get back to me, but still i had never used weapons on ground before so it would be an interesting <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
i am looking at my command card right now and i cant remember much from most of these games so i will not give a full report, just some random stuff i do <br/>
<br/>
remember:<br/>
game 1 i lost to booker, he had a fairly standard build of insurrection rebel pilots, which is by far the best deck for either side in the format.  he was <br/>
able to knock me out of space (he wasn't activating a ton but the deploy modifiers on mon cal v and mansaya meant he had enough) by beating me down and <br/>
drawing high enough to make me lose a ship and the pilot.  he ended up winning by 13<br/>
then i played schoenthal.  no clue really what he had for his deck, i know that he started draw their fire though and i think i got more use out of it than <br/>
him and was able to inflate the differential in what had been a somewhat close game for the first 25 minutes.  i won by 24.  next i played tim simon.  i <br/>
think this was the game where the weapons really came thru and we had a lot of interaction on the ground.  i know i took overflow i think, i had like some <br/>
good character in front of his chewie w/blaster, but he persona replaced w/chewie protector and cancelled my guys text.  ahh he cancelled jodo's text so i <br/>
couldnt shoot my gun, thats right.  pretty good play by aglets.  eventually though my power guysl ize xizor and vader took over though and i drained him out <br/>
for a win by 12.  final game was vs westergard, idk anything about this game but i won by 8.<br/>
<br/>
so i finished 3-1, 6(+31), which was good enough for third place dark side (and third place overall).  matt sokol went 4-0 w/dark and got the dark worlds <br/>
bye.  westergard was the best lightp layer so his bye passed to booker.  everyone said to just use the prizes for the cube event the next day so we didnt <br/>
hand stuff out then.  i paid off the con people and then we left and went to applebee's.  it was kind of rowdy cause we had 15 people and we just all sat at <br/>
the bar.  CT and i split nachos and bbq boneless wings.  i drank a diet pepsi.  <br/>
<br/>
i was staying at bookers with some other folks.  i claimed the downstairs smaller couch.  a few others were in that room too.  i wanted to sleep but brian <br/>
fred was brian fredding it and talking nonstop with his collection of badbeat stories to anyone who would listen.  eventually i got to bed at 3 i guess.<br/>
<br/>
CT had volunteered to be the TD for the convention if i paid for his badge.  i got him his badge and a dinner but eventually i decided i would run the event, <br/>
i wanted to play but had been studying the AR and a lot of rules the past few weeks in preparations for td-ing the event.  so i decided i would run it after <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
hmm so i guess at some point when we were down stairs, like me schoestopper fred and steve, the living legend scott kenneth jackson comes downstairs with a <br/>
bit of sweat upon his brow.  scott, as some of you may know, is the icon booker and i look up to.  he makes leon phelps look like a saint.  anyway i talk <br/>
with scott a little and he has some awkward interactions with steve chris and brian.  so like it turns out scott had been upstairs plowing bookers roomate.  <br/>
like, thats fine, and the reason i look up to scott.  but like, the problem is, bookers roommate, well , she lives there, and so does her boyfriend.  so yeah <br/>
that was fcking weired as sh1t.  but like, idk, the admiral (guy whos gf cheated on him) is a really cool dude, but he did steal the girl from his own best <br/>
<br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
like, i think i need to make a list to explain this. cast of characters:<br/>
1. james booker- lives in the house.  innocent bystander.  does the larry david "wtf" shoulder shrug when stuff like this happens<br/>
2. samantha- bookers female roommate.  currently "dating" the admiral.  currently screwing scott<br/>
3. the admiral- bookers male roommate.  currently "dating" samantha<br/>
4. scott- the guy booker and i aspire to be.  currently plowing samantha<br/>
5. theron nett (non v)- booker's other male roommate who lives in the basement.  irrelevant<br/>
6. ryan galaxy quest- used to date samantha, til lshe dumped him for his best friend, the admiral.  plays swccg<br/>
7. brian deitrich- a fag, who screws this busted chick on the side, so that hes not all the way gay.<br/>
<br/>
so anyway i guess things are really bizarre at the booker residence right now.  oh btw the funny thing about scott, is like, he is a total ladies man, and an <br/>
<br/>
icon.  but, booker and i basically made him who he was.  he is older and kinda a creepy dude but we helped him rework his image and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
wow i got really sidetracked.  back to swccg<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
the alarm rang at like 6:30 and i was the first in the shower which was cool.  we left at about 7:30 i think and got into the con hall and sat some stuff up. <br/>
<br/>
 we again stole the sign from pokemons and hung our banner from it.<br/>
<br/>
(note this is where i stopped writing when i tried the tr in mid july.  its now august 15 as i try to finish typing it so it may be kind of bootleg).  anyway <br/>
<br/>
people show up on time for the most part and we get our first pairings announced at 9:30, only 30 minutes behind schedule.  i let the players vote if they <br/>
<br/>
wanted 8 or 6 games, and they overwhelmingly chose 6.   <br/>
<br/>
i played in some of the rounds a pick up game vs the person with the bye.  i know i played tom hollingworth round 1 and my goofy trm always drew 5's and 6's <br/>
<br/>
and beat his huntdown by single digits.  i played alexandre and think i used dbo to beat his cc dark drains deck.  i used mistryls against marcel's light cc <br/>
aliens deck and won.  i played against mr. burton and had to scoop the game cause the round was ending, but i think he was gonna beat me, he had whap and had <br/>
gained a strong foothold and i was dark combat and ran out of tricks fairly fast.  i know 1 or 2 rounds the bye person just went to the exhibitor hall <br/>
instead of playing.<br/>
<br/>
we had 23 people, and improvement over 19 we had last year.  things could be even bigger next year:  reid and his crew could come, meeker should be back, <br/>
etc, we could easily hit 30+ i think<br/>
<br/>
so anywaY after the swiss rounds, i give out prizes, from the bottom up though, so newer players got uc sheets and v card printouts that they needed<br/>
desai plays tom h and westergard plays b fred in the top 4<br/>
desai vs tom h i think both lights won, desais by 16 toms by 5 so desai moves on<br/>
jan vs fred both lights win, freds by 14 jans by 16<br/>
so the final then is jan vs justin.<br/>
game 1 jan wins tto vs senate by like 8 i think.  really brief recap was justin had an early corran he wanted to use vs merrejik at a ds2 db but that cant <br/>
happen so corran went to the bunker instead.  next turn down comes maul+ihyn, but jan draws low, still i think justin lost corran and 4 force.  after that it <br/>
was just a damage race, jan had breached defenses and commands and stuff and was fairly well fortified so it was hard to beat him in space.  i think justin <br/>
did do some damage on the ground, including the sweet play of jedi luke for 5 to the endor db to kill a vader.  in the end though, jan had a lot of direct <br/>
damage flow going and enough controls to get past any atrocity justin had<br/>
game 2 jan wins by 3.  sorta strange game, jan wins a number of blind combats with all the high destinies in his deck.  he wins the race and justin just <br/>
loses 6, which is a good play i think since justin was trying to win by more than 8 so making sure jan gets no retrevial was key.  the racing shield did hit <br/>
play after the race to suspend i did it i think.  for a number of turns i think justin was at the 3/2 and jan would drop a guy, combat, then move away.  at <br/>
some point there were some battles when jan i think moved over to stop the drain of 3.  i'm not doing this game justice at all it was really played on both <br/>
sides and incredibly tense but in the end jan wins by 3 and is the eastern national champion!<br/>
<br/>
so anyway, while the final was going on, we had like everyone not in the top 4 fro mthe nationals, plus a few stragglers we picked up over the weekend (being <br/>
at a con + the banner= good recruiting tools).  another good recruiting tool is the line: you know shaggy? the musician? did you know he was a marine? but i digress.  so jpb used some of his negotiation skillz and got a sweet hookup from NATE HILL and we did a reflections 3 <br/>
draft.  each player got a jabbas sealed deck and 2 reflections 3 packs.  it was secret squirrell so whatever you opened you could play.  yeah there was <br/>
broken stuff but so what! lol.  we did institute the "aglets timed games" rule, where, basically, the last game going of each round is automatically a timed <br/>
game.  it makes for faster games and eliminates stalling<br/>
so i open my stuff and have some cool cards-obi, jk, fett, bh, TESSEK, etc.  i debate playing a trm style deck, starting the cc security tower and pulling <br/>
lando with ax, but decide that the mkos objective is too good to pass up, especially since i can flip with amanamin (i had one of the unique guy as my rep <br/>
and one of the non uniques).  also lol i got fear is my ally and the "only get 2 destiny w/non uniques" card so i played it, thinking that in jpsd everyone <br/>
<br/>
gets a palace raider and merc pilot so it could actually see some play.  only other thing was i started twilek for seeking to get underworld contacts for +1 <br/>
activation, but looking back i think i could have just started underworld so i guess im a noob<br/>
<br/>
i played vs nate hills minion game 1.  he hadnt played sw in some time and like underdeploys a lot and i beat on him some.  i get bargawin going with my 2x <br/>
aura sings gun and draw mass 7's and he usually doesnt even have 4 ability so i win with a bunch of cards on table<br/>
then i know i played vs westray cobbler.  he had some strong pulls: hcf and kiffex.  and leia rp.  and a life debt and leias back to pull them.  dang.  but <br/>
like he puts leia in front of some aliens and then i drop OBI JK to get past her text and kill her.  he gets kiffex fast but i use the take me to jabba now <br/>
to get tessek and do mad drop and drain with my aliens, while i am able to use flip mkos to cancel kiffex once, and then retreieve the generic amamnin that i <br/>
lost to his drain another time.  win<br/>
<br/>
then vs schoenthal he puts out lord maul but i blind draw a 5 with lando to kill him which is numpty-ish.  he no escapes maul back and puts him at a desert <br/>
so i sandwhirl him.  from there i do a fett beatdown and then tessek seals the deal<br/>
<br/>
so i guess i win the goof event at 3-0.  idk it was fun, yeah there is some broke stuff and combos but its not like we were playing for big prizes it was <br/>
more about opening some ref 3 really and just relaxing while the top 4 went on.<br/>
it was real cool i think we had 4 players who played the sealed who didnt play in the main event so like 27, plus me so 28 maybe unique players, plus 1 or <br/>
two who only did the friday event, i think 29 unique players over the weekend, HUGE!<br/>
<br/>
so after jan wins he poses for some hulk hogan like title belt photos by the banner with his glass.  then we go to eat at the mongaliod bbq place.  the crew <br/>
is: aglets, me, booker, schoe-stopper, jan, reegesk.  the motliest of motley crue's but oh well.  it was good times for sure.  found out at dinner jan's name <br/>
is pronounced "yon", not jan, john, jacob, jingleheimer, schmidt, etc.  btw a note on aglets- so liek when you play vs him, he totally does sound effects <br/>
like that one guy from police academy.  at first it tilted me but now booker and i think its effing priceless, like making light saber clash sounds and <br/>
stuff, it makes the games hillarious<br/>
<br/>
i guess i went to bed then?  <br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
sunday i went to the con but nothing really went on.  i dont recall anything sweet happening.  i guess i will talk about the exhibitor hall now.  actually i <br/>
think i did mostly, so i wil ljust mention one more story.  this one booth sells wooden swords and stuff you can actually fight with.  idk they had videos <br/>
and do meets and stuff i guess.  anyway this guy busts out his pride and joy, sexcalibur or something, and is like "whenever i go into a big fight i use <br/>
this, its my most trusted sword.  its gotten me to a ranking of 5th place on our local league"<br/>
FIFTH PLACE?  wtf?  this seemed unbelievable for a number of reasons. first, it implies 5 people actually do this, which is a stretch.  also, if hes only #5, <br/>
why am i gonna buy from him?  i want my real fake wood swords from the number one guy.  like, 5th locally?  sh1t, that means this clown isnt even like one of <br/>
the top 20 people nationally maybe.  like, it would be the same as me going to the miani dolphins (1-15) instead of the patriots (18-1) to learn football.  <br/>
<br/>
wtf mate?<br/>
<br/>
oh yeah we went to the pokemon tourney area (not sure if i told this story yet or if i am gonna brian fred you all and do it again).  there was a back room with pizza for the judges.  so schoestopper, jpb andi go there and jpb eats a slice and i have one on my tounge and some guy yells STOP.  WHY ARE YOU EATING MY JUDGES PIZZA?  so i take the slice off of my tounge and put it back in the box.  then we make up some story and mentions the word "poekmons" and hes like I AM THE HEAD OF THE POKEMONS.  so idk then we leave i guess<br/>
<br/>
so at this point i am phoning in this tr, i will liekly try to do another tr from this summer and it may have some erratas to this tr.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
way too many people to thank individually just mega props to the PC and anyone who played or just stopped by to say hi or ask about the game over the <br/>
weekend.  i had a blast playing in the side events and directing the main one.  lets do it again next year!<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
oh yeah.  so i decided to title this tr "epic fail".  now, i know some of you might wonder: brad eier, how did you get so sexay?  also then you might wonder: <br/>
<br/>
how can an event where we had 29 unique players, and 3 more who wanted to play but couldnt cause of time constraints, be considered an epic fail?  i will now <br/>
tell you.  you see, long ago, team ohio came on to the scene and caused a lot of commotion with our great successes and zany antics.  after some amount of <br/>
time, some people tired of these shenanigans, and decired team ohio as trying to "kill swccg".  i am not sure how people found out our master plan, but they <br/>
did.  nevertheless, we continued with our mission, our single solitary purpose: to destroy the game of swccg.  we got pretty far into our conquest.  but <br/>
sadly, we failed.  we tried so hard to get swccg removed from the cons, so no one would even speak the name STAR WARS kinda like when "moses" got banned <br/>
after they found out he wasnt egyptian.  but, i let down my teammates and those in league with me, i failed, and had 30 people show up to a con and play <br/>
swccg.  to those who joined my dark alliance to ruin swccg: i have failed you.  swccg is not dead, cannot die, and will not die.  we set out on this quest in <br/>
2005, and now, it has ended, like the last unsuccessful crusade.<br/>
<br/>
to those who fought valiantly and have kept swccg from being destroyed: congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
hehe that last part was just a joke, i am nothing short of thrilled that we had 30 people interested in swccg over the weekend, it is a huge sign that the <br/>
game is still around and that cons are (as i predicted, cause im always right) the most important tool we have as a sw community<br/>
<br/>
epic fail is kind of a cool play on the words too cause i thought this tr qould be epic but i kinda failed to make it so lol<br/>
<br/>
so here is a funny story involving booker and jan's dad, old man westergard.  so at yavin 2005 the night before the event there was a warm up and some casual play and booker is testing vs westergard and booker is light.  now booker had a limited resources in his deck, with "boba fett bh" written on it as a proxie.  so anyway the game gets down to the wire and westergard has only 2 cards in hand and booker totally slowrolls him with the limited as a limited lol<br/>
<br/>
also here is the brian fred momaw nadon story.  he tells it each time we see him and its just ridiculous so here goes:<br/>
like ok this guy put out a wampa but then i snared him with momaw nadon but the wampa ate momaw so momaw went ot the bacta tank then came back out and snared the second wampa then that one ate momaw but then the two wampas ate each other.  the end<br/>
