<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Here it is, the world-famous Enduro has hit Northern CA at<br>
A-1 Comics in Roseville, CA (not far from Sacramento).  For<br>
those who don’t know, this is 4 tournies back-to-back-to-back-<br>
to-back.  16 games straight!  Will I make it through without<br>
collapsing from exhaustion?  Heck yeah, I ain’t no wuss!<br>
<br>
So I playtest until 3 AM the night before Enduro (not a bright<br>
idea, I know) with Alex Thompson and we’re confident with our<br>
decks.  For dark, I made Court (posted on Decktech already),<br>
Hunt Down dueling, and Hunt Down TIEs (otherwise known as <br>
FlOps, baby!).  Yup, I made a FlOps deck.  I would post it to<br>
decktech, but people will give me 2-3 stars just cuz its FlOps<br>
and won’t care about how it works.  Just to be clear, FlOps is<br>
Flagship Operations (you know, the effect that deploys on a<br>
star destroyer when 5 executor sites are on table).  Its cool<br>
cuz no one expects it and they think you’re actually playing<br>
Hunt Down.  I don’t start Epic Duel though.<br>
<br>
For Light, I build myself a Profit deck as well as seriously<br>
tweak my EBO deck (also posted on decktech but its been<br>
modified).  At Enduro we can change decks between tournaments,<br>
so I brought multiple decks in case one turned out crappy.  I<br>
made Profit cuz I wanted to beat down on MKOS, TIE, &amp; BHBM <br>
decks.  Profit does that (at least mine does).<br>
<br>
Like I said, I stayed up till 3 AM, and I wake up at 8 AM.<br>
Crap!  The tourney starts at 10 AM and it’ll take us 2.5 hours<br>
to get there!  So I wake up Alex and we’re getting ready fast.<br>
I’m hungry though so I make myself a potato really quick (The<br>
Potato, baby!) and we’re out the door and on our way after<br>
stopping for gas and some soda.  We get there at like 11 AM,<br>
but they haven’t started yet.<br/>
<br/>
Now like I said, Enduro is 4 tournies, so I’ll be writing 4<br/>
separate TRs since I don’t think any of you want to read a 16 <br/>
game TR.  For this 1st tourney, I play my EBO (a proven winner<br/>
which uses xwings and EBG to pull my Rogue pilots and put them<br/>
in their matching speeders).  For dark I go with the FlOps<br/>
deck.  Hey, this is Enduro, so any deck goes.  I pay my $15<br/>
entry fee (for all 4 swiss tournies), and here we go.  Its<br/>
about noon when we start.  40 people showed up to play.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v Alex Thompson’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Wtf?!  I play my ride in the 1st game?  Oh well.  I’ve been<br/>
schooling Alex on how to play and make better decks.  When I<br/>
1st met him he was like 1420 rating, but in 2 tournies he’s<br/>
now 1550 or something.  So I’m proud of his improvement.  I <br/>
know one day he’ll Circle me (he is the student and will one<br/>
day become the master), but that day isn’t today.  I setup EBO<br/>
by 2nd turn, he deploys Emp, Xizor, Ephont, and EPP Fett to <br/>
his Tat DB.  I started Battle Plan, so he’s not paying to <br/>
drain.  He kept looking for DBs when there weren’t any, so I<br/>
was able to verify and since I know his deck I could tell if <br/>
he had any ships in his hand.  He never drew any ships (he <br/>
plays 5).<br/>
<br/>
So EBO drains are rolling, he had started Decree but like I <br/>
said he deployed to the DBs.  He knows I play Ice Storm, so he<br/>
finally drops Tempest 1, I barrier.  He deploys Piett aboard.<br/>
I have Iceboy Luke in Rogue 1 with Hobbie in there too.  No <br/>
Vader on table yet (so Luke can stay in Rogue 1 for now).  I<br/>
battle, and have a few xwings at Hoth, plus I draw 5, so Piett<br/>
dies and I’m immune to his attrition w/EBG.  Then Jabba comes<br/>
down (outside the ATAT), I barrier.  4Lom backs him up outside,<br/>
draws some.  I Ice Storm, leaving Tempest 1 alone now for the<br/>
beating.  I have Zev in Rogue 2 there now, so they all battle,<br/>
he loses Tempest 1 plus 6 more.  He finally pays to drain for<br/>
1 and I cancel it w/Rebel Fleet.  3 turns later the drains<br/>
finish him, Vader or a ship of his never hit the table.  I <br/>
like to see that!  Win by 32.  2 (+32).<br/>
<br/>
Best: No opposition in space at all.<br/>
Worst: Beating Alex.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Paul McKelvey’s TIGIH (Insurr, Staging, Strike<br/>
                                                 Planning)<br/>
Here we go, time to see how FlOps does.  I start<br/>
IAO, Mob Pts, &amp; Something Special Planned.  He doesn’t like the<br/>
matchup, but I tell him he’ll be surprised.  I get 2 executor<br/>
sites in my opening hand, so I pull the DB and I’ve got 5<br/>
sites on table already.  I only play 5 sites too, what are the<br/>
odds?  I get Piett to the DB w/ Merrejk to pull systems.  I<br/>
get FlOps out by 2nd turn (I just put it on a VSD) and get some<br/>
big drains with Chiraneau and TIEs and VSDs at Kashyyk, Kiffex,<br/>
Sullust, &amp; Rendili.  Meanwhile, he’s invading my executor w/<br/>
spies.  2nd turn Blount &amp; others beat on Piett, Merrejk, &amp;<br/>
Gherant.  I lose Gherant.  I move away.  Next turn, Cracken<br/>
beats on Piett &amp; Merrijk, I lose Merrejk.  Next turn, Lando <br/>
w/AX &amp; someone beats on Piett and I lose him and 3 or 4 more.<br/>
Jeez, so many spies.  I deploy Coward to kill the drains on my<br/>
3rd turn.  Thats the last battle.  So he’s got 3 stacked.<br/>
<br/>
He’s got no ships, so its a drain race.  He pulls Back Door,<br/>
but I drop U-3Po to block it.  Problem is, now he’s got 2 BG<br/>
sites to satisfy Coward.  No prob, I retrieve with Short Range<br/>
Fighters, plus I had been retrieving w/SFS and deploying<br/>
guys like Emp’s Shield and sword and Interceptors.  So the game<br/>
goes quick, drain...your turn...drain....your turn.  My drains<br/>
and retrieval were too much.  He had no retrieval.  Win by 11.<br/>
4 (+43).<br/>
<br/>
Best: FlOps won!  Paul is a really good player too.<br/>
Worst:  The Executor being overrun.  I don’t play Vader, only<br/>
4 characters (Piett, Chiraneau, Merrejk, Gherent).<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Sal’s SYCFA TIEs (TINT/OE, BatOrder, Mob Pts)<br/>
<br/>
Crap.  I never played against TIEs w/my EBO deck (except TIE<br/>
Bombers, which don’t count).  Well, the Interceptors made <br/>
short work of my xwings.  I setup EBO fast, but he had good<br/>
drains at Endor and Kessel w/Chiraneau there.  Merrejk was at<br/>
the DS DB.  I couldn’t draw a Rogue speeder for the life of me.<br/>
So I transit over w/Luke, Wedge, and Zev.  He drops LVader,<br/>
Arica (breaks cover), Janus, battles.  I lose Zev, he loses<br/>
Arica.  I run back to Hoth.  I’m draining at Kiffex, Alderaan,<br/>
and Hoth, but I’m paying for my drains, and he’s cancelling 1<br/>
w/Imperial Fleet.  I move my lone xwing out of Alderaan after<br/>
he draws a lot cuz I fear the POTF beatdown and I don’t have a<br/>
Houjix.  I also can’t get my Incom out, that’s just wrong!<br/>
<br/>
So my deck is getting low, and he goes and drops a bunch at<br/>
Kiffex and battles me, I play Organized and somehow win the<br/>
battle by drawing high, so he just loses 2 TIEs (1 to used). <br/>
I’m out of Organized Attacks for the moment, so I play AWRI &amp;<br/>
replace 3 xwings w/a squadron.  Draw, and get an Organized.<br/>
Perfect.  Eat a drain of 5, he Lateral Damages my squadron,<br/>
shoots down 2 xwings, and I’m left with 1 xwing and a damaged<br/>
squadron.  Thats game right there.  I took the risk he didn’t<br/>
have the cannons, since he only drew a couple, but he got it.<br/>
Dumb.  Lose by 13.  4 (+30).<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really...I had a couple big drains but I had to <br/>
pay for them!<br/>
Worst: Not drawing speeders.  I could’ve taken over DS DB w/ <br/>
a couple speeders.  Or at least occupied my North Ridge so I<br/>
wouldn’t have to pay for my drains.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Brian’s WYS (Squassin, BatPlan, Insurr)<br/>
<br/>
Like a scrub I’m letting him activate 3 at his DBs.  But <br/>
Staging isn’t on the table!  Dumb!  Well, I catch it on like<br/>
the 3rd or 4th turn, but he got the force early on.  I get<br/>
Piett at Exec DB, pull Gherent to pull my Exec sites. He puts <br/>
Luke on Artoo in Red 5 &amp; an RFC in RedSquad 1.  I drop a <br/>
VSD, put FlOps on it (this is the 4th turn), drop 3 Intercep-<br/>
tors, Cannons, Battle Deployment, Lateral Damage on Red 5, <br/>
then battle.  I play APTW, blow away RedSquad 1 (didn’t think<br/>
I could hit a maneuver 8 red 5).  So he loses them and 17<br/>
force.  I send a TIE used.  He loses a lot of ships off the<br/>
top, so i just spread and drain and stop drawing.  U-3po is <br/>
at his Cantina, so he’s done.  Win by 35.  6 (+65).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Did FlOps just go 2-0?  Yes, it did!<br/>
Worst: Letting him get that extra force early on.<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of people went 4-0, so I’m in the middle.  But I had<br/>
2 wins over 30, so I’m happy.  We get a 45 minute break, I<br/>
find out Nick Stefanko beatdown with his CPI deck (not SYCFA<br/>
though).  He’s keeping a tally of how many systems he <br/>
blows away, so check out his TR cuz that deck is too cool <br/>
(kind of like someone’s FlOps deck I know...heheh).  I’m<br/>
tired just from writing this 1st quarter of Enduro, so that’s<br/>
all for today.  Man, I don’t know if I’ll get around to <br/>
writing the other 3 quarters of Enduro....maybe tomorrow.  I<br/>
must still be tired I guess.  Thanks for reading. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
