<br>
So it begins<br>
<br>
It was my brothers birthday the day before the tourney, and he wanted to have a bunch of people over to celebrate and, of course, to play SWCCG.  Thankfully, my parents were willing to drive a bunch of us down to the tourney as part of the party.  Anyway, on to the tourney itself.<br>
<br>
To start things off, let me just say that this was the first tournament that I had ever played in at Severna Park and I was very impressed.  I had played with nearly all of the guys before at other various events, but never all together since MD states.  In that way it was almost like a reunion, but oh well, enough of the nostalgia, on to the pre-tourney stuff.  Feel free to skip the next 3 paragraphs if you just want to read about the matchups.<br>
<br>
First off, the actual facility itself was awesome.  There was a large open space in the middle with like 20 tables or something that could be moved around.  There was a nice big screen TV there (which we never used, but still it looked cool), a vending machine, and even a Fussball (Foosball?) table.  Definitely the perfect place for a SWCCG tournament, and I look forward to playing there again.  <br>
<br>
This tournament was also special because it marked the beginning of the money pool.  The pool was basically a side bet where anyone who wanted to, could put in an extra $5.  This prize money was distributed between the top 3 players who entered the pool 50-30-20.  But more on that later, as I was one who decided to put the $5 in.  Ralph Anger was an excellent TD; very organized and very knowledgeable of the game.  So anyway, lets start the tourney!<br>
<br>
The tournament began at 5pm, and 12 people showed up to play.  This was awesome considering the turnout Im used to is typically six or so.  After a short V Set 6 discussion (which basically said that there could not be a Super Hidden Hidden Base), Ralph Anger collected the fees and the $5 from those who wanted to play for cash.  The matchups were made and the tourney began.  By the way, the two decks I brought were DS  My take on Jonny Chus Speed Deal and LS  My new-school TRM<br>
<br>
(Note: all ratings for this tournament will be the Decipher ratings.  After the tourney it was agreed that we will be boycotting Decipher from now on.  So future TRs will have the slightly unofficial but free MD ratings)<br>
<br>
Game 1  My TRM (1801) vs. Jesse Hartlines CCT (1652)<br>
<br>
With vset 6 becoming legal the day before, I would have been disappointed if I did not play against the new CCT before the day was over.  For this matchup, I start Strike Planning, Insurrection/Aim High, and Wokling (v).  He uses Any Methods Necessary to get Fett (v) and his gun (v).  So the game starts with me pulling Riekann (v), putting him at the Home One: Dbay, pulling the Hoth war room and thats it.  On his turn, he drops the new Fett with his new gun at the Security Tower to watch over Jabbas Prize.  He also pulls the spiffy Special Delivery (v) which is just sick.  On my turn, Corran Horn comes down with I think Obi w/stick but I may be wrong.  Anyway we battle, Fett dies, and I honestly cant remember who I bumped off from attrition.  After the brief skirmish in the tower, I free Han.  He then drops some people at the Audience Chamber and the Carbonite chamber.  By this time I pull Navander (v) who pulls Kessel, and HCF held that system for the rest of the game.  He puts out the new Lando (v) which keeps scoundrel from coming out, but we really dont battle too much for the rest of the game.  I keep pinging him from Kessel, and a drain of 1 at the cloud city docking bay with some people (I think Luke w/stick was there along with Riekann and navander who transitted over).  LS Prof comes down on Luke to help with power and drains.  Towards the end of the game there was a battle where some hunters captured Luke with stick and Navander (v).  But none of his torture cards worked because he would either use them in the wrong phase or something like that.  Anyway, this pinging went on a long time.  Too long, in fact, and we timed.  Yuck, I hate timing.<br>
TW  1 (+16)<br>
<br>
Props:  <br>
Jesse for being a great opponent.  We joked a lot and had a good time.<br>
Corran Horn for being my favorite spy.  <br>
HCF for being HCF.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:  <br/>
Timing.<br/>
<br/>
After the first round was done, the matchups were again determined and I got to play Jesse again!  Yay.  I know for a fact Kevin Elia and Jon Westergard won in their first matches, as well as Greg Hitt.  Sorry that I dont have detailed results after every round, but anyway, on to round 2.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  Speed Deal vs. Jesse Hartlines Combat Racing<br/>
<br/>
Before I start saying anything, mad props to Jonny Chu.  Speed Deal is an incredible dark deck, and he deserves all the credit in the world for putting it together.  My version has a few slight differences (a bit of v6) but not enough to warrant my posting it or anything.  So I start the speed deal stuff (Combat Response, Im Sorry, and Ket (v)), he starts racing.  Unfortunately, for the life of me I cannot remember what effect he started though.  So I do my thing, he does his.  Jesse won the podrace on like turn 3 or 4 before I had had the chance to deal (lame I know) him any real damage.  So I pull Reactor Terminal (v) and he retrieves one force for free.  I cant quite remember why deal took long to set up, I think I had trouble finding a ship/pilot combo or something.  Bad Feeling Have I comes out, which he promptly Alters.  Deal gets rolling and I hit him for like 12 damage or so.  He puts Qui-Gon at the 3/2 site with a lightsaber, and some other people at the 2/2 site.  I pull Battle Order and he doesnt drain me for more than 4 total per turn.  He did make a run on Cloud City, but did not clear the site out.  Sensing a beatdown on my next turn, he used On the Edge to target Lando Scoundrel.  He fails and Lando is lost.  Unfortunately he did this during my control phase so I got a drain of 4 on him right after that (+1 site +2 from deal.).  I managed to keep a hold on space and after a few more turns of big damage this game is over.  FW 2 (+20)<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  3 (+36)<br/>
<br/>
Props:  <br/>
Jesse for being a cool opponent again.  <br/>
Jonny Chu for creating an awesome dark deck.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:  <br/>
Me for not remembering more details of the match.  <br/>
<br/>
So by now I know that me, Jon, and Elia are still undefeated going into round 3.  Matchups are drawn, Jon and Elia play each other for round 3.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 3  Speed Deal vs. Chris Angers MBO (1739)<br/>
<br/>
First some interesting but useless trivia.  At states this year I played against a version of this deck.  Chris beat me then, and we reminisce a little about old times before we start.  He tells me that his deck has improved a lot since then, and Im feeling a little shaky, I know this match is going to probably decide if I get a chance at the cash.<br/>
<br/>
I start the usual, Chris starts Squassin, Great Shot, Kid and Strike Planning.  Im feeling a little defensive, as I know hes packing quite a bit of space.  First turn I just put out the cloud city sector and draw, looking for Decree (v) and a Masterful Move/Ghhhk.  The one icon from the cloud sector gave him just enough force to flip first turn.  Riekann goes to a site and pulls the jungle.  General Jar Jar goes to the jungle, and another scrub went to the Y4 Dbay.  He flips.  My turn.  I get deal set up, and am still frantically searching for Decree (v)!  Where is my Imperial Decree?!!  Fortunately for me, Chris is having trouble finding the disco ball.  On his turn he does little except draw for it.  By the look on his face I know whats coming next turn.  Well, there wasnt much I could do about it, so I just focused on doing the deal thing.  Zuckuss and the virtual Mist Hunter went to space with virtual Dengar in his virtual Punishing One.  Boba Fett, BH provided support on the Hunter.  I deal him a ton of damage (I think Occupation was out by now), thinking I might be able to pull this one off.  He uses It Could Be Worse to reduce one drain, which I grab.  By the way, Decree (v) evaded me for the entire game, and so did Ghhhk.  He puts down Civil Disorder (v), the Disco Ball, and plays Fly Casual to put Luke with Artoo Detoo in Red 5 (and cannon) at the Death Star.  Advance Prep (v) gets him the trench, Attack Run, and torpedoes.  And away goes the disco ball, I lose 14 force.  After losing some from my hand, I top deck the rest, watching my precious Ghhhks leave me forever.<br/>
<br/>
One really dumb thing I did was forget about the drain bonuses he got in space, so he got a nice sized drain on me next turn before I pulled Resistance.  The rest of the game was like clockwork.  HCF came down a lot, and if I killed it, he just lost it, and pulled another one for free using Great Shot Kid.  He puts Wedge at Hoth and Luke at Yavin 4.  They sit there for the rest of the game and drain me.  HCF comes back and settles down at the Cloud City sector.  My deal damage is slowly lessened as characters continually come down to battle me.  And Civil Disorder (v) ensures that as many times as he battles me, he gets another character to come down next turn.  Space was just plain bad for me.  Home One came down for free, so did the Liberty.  His retrieval was endless.  Every turn he would retrieve at least 3 (sometimes 6) from Great Shot Kid, Luke (v) sometimes retrieved, and he would constantly get characters back with Disorder.  Im sure I made him lose his entire deck by the end of the game, but it didnt matter as he kept getting so much of it back.  It was a fun game though, and he definitely deserved the win.  I look forward to playing this matchup again someday. <br/>
FL 0 (-14)<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 3 (+22)<br/>
<br/>
Props: <br/>
Chris for playing the best MBO deck I have ever seen.<br/>
Great Shot Kid for being so darn good (for him).<br/>
My space for lasting as long as it did.<br/>
The infinite loop with the Liberty is tech.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Imperial Decree (v) for staying away from me.  (as well as my Twilek Advisor at WMAOPs)<br/>
Great Shot Kid for being so darn good (for him).<br/>
The Ghhhks for evading me too, preventing me from safely spreading out for maximum Deal damage.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I would like to take a short break to point out something amazing that happened concurrently with my third game.  My friend Brandon Powers was playing my brother.  It was Brandons MBO vs. my brothers SYC flip.  From what I heard, it began as a pretty uneventful match, Fear (v) never really got going, and I dont think the Death Star ever got Alderaan.  However, my brother was able to stall the inevitable for a few turns.  Then finally, the Attack Run was made.  Guess who went into the trench?  Luke was the lead starfighter, followed by his wingmen Biggs and Wedge.  My brother sent in some TIEs with cannons, and managed to kill off Biggs.  Luke was able to find the exhaust port, and the Death Star was no more.  I think that is just plain awesome, and definitely worth mentioning in this TR.  Have any of you guys ever had a game like that where you and your opponent relived a scene from one of the movies?  If so, please let me know, I think thats pretty darn cool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the tourney.  Jon managed to defeat Elia, meaning that he was undefeated as of right now.  I figured that my chance of getting my money back were slim to none by now, since I had a measly 3 victory points.  But anyway, on to the final round.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 TRM vs. Mike Battaglias Court (1595)<br/>
<br/>
I believe this tourney marks the first time that Mike has played a dark deck other than Invasion in quite some time.  I helped him design this deck the day before, and I knew it had a punch, especially with help from Vset 6.<br/>
I start the same stuff as before, Mike starts Power of the Hutt, Krayt Dragon Bones (v), and Blaster Rack (v).<br/>
<br/>
My setup is exactly the same, I put Riekann at his favorite dbay, and pull the war room.  I was also fortunate enough to get an underwater site in my starting hand.  I lose one to court damage, and its his go.  Fett (v) comes down right away to the audience chamber thanks to the chambers text.  Of course he gets his rifle (v) which pulls Jabbas Influence (v).  Anyway, Im happy because Fett is all by himself and I have a bunch of EPPs in my hand.  So Quiggy w/stick (or Obi, I really dont remember) comes down and slices him up, committing suicide for the greater good.  This basically sets the stage for the first 4 turns or so.  He puts out a character or two, I kill them.  He then puts out more to bump mine off, I retaliate, etc.  There was one tense moment, however, where Lando (v) came down with Mandalorian Armor.  If he had had Hidden Weapons, he could have flipped his obj and caused me some serious problems.  But fortunately he did not, and another saber sent evil Lando to his end.  I put Yoda, MOTF at my Naboo Dbay, for little reason except that I figure hes running low on characters by now, and I want an Alter to get rid of Scum and Villainy.  Unfortunately, all I could find was a Sense, but that will come in handy later.<br/>
<br/>
Remember when I said he started Krayt (v)?  Well, he made use of it on his next turn.  Super Bubo came down to meet Yoda, and I needed to draw a 3 to keep him alive.  What do I draw?  A 2.  So Yoda goes down to Bubo, giving Mike and myself possibly one of the funniest mental pictures of all time in SWCCG.  Bubo remains there for the rest of the game, as I eventually get a good grip on the Audience Chamber and do not wish to fight off Bubo at all.  At some point Kessel gets out again thanks to Romas (v), and again HCF makes its appearance.  It took me a while to put out HCF, I was waiting for a certain card to make its way into my hand<br/>
<br/>
I think Mike made one more strong attack for the Audience Chamber, with another Fett.  He attempts to Hidden Weapons my Lando, Scoundrel but ah, my Sense proves its worth.  Obi w/Stick was on the table, and made sure that my destiny would go through.  Mike puts Mara Jade (and her saber) along with someone else (Xizor I believe) at the Great Pit of Carkoon.  I eventually get my Alter too, and Scum and Villainy goes away.  Menace Fades caps the Carkoon drain at 1.  HCF got rushed by Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Dengar in Punishing One.  Thankfully, I had saved a few force up on purpose, and the Spiral came down as a react.  Life Debt came out too, and Zuckuss and Dengar both died, and the Spiral had to go to attrition.  That gave me a solid hold on Kessel, and I think I drained him out for the rest of the game.  Thanks to the ever popular On The Edge/Flash of Insight (v) combo, I retrieve five force twice throughout the game, keeping my differential pretty high.  I eventually outdrain him and the tourney is over.<br/>
FW 2 (+28)<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 5 (+50)<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Mikes Bubo for eating Yoda, that was just hilarious.<br/>
Life Debt and Spiral, for protecting space.<br/>
On the Edge/Flash (v) for being just ridiculously fun.<br/>
Mike for playing a new objective, I cant wait to see how it evolves.  <br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
None that I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
Elia and Jon played again in round 4, this time Kevin proved the victor.  So Elia won the tourney with six victory points and the largest differential.  I was anxiously watching the other players who had put money in, Elia and Jon both did, and they finished 1st and 2nd in the money pool.  I was hoping to maybe get 3rd, and now you will learn the reason for the title of this report.  Chris Westergard played a phenomenal game against Kyle Hartline in the last round.  Chris was playing a Watto deck with Trooper Sabacc and other fun stuff.  I watched the end of it, and it looked pretty intense.  Kyles Ben Kenobi bounced Master Luke back after a battle, and it looked like it would never end.  They eventually timed and Chris won.  So after the final scores were tallied; the results were posted:<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Elia: 6(+73) <br/>
<br/>
Chris Anger: 6(+58) <br/>
<br/>
Jon Westergard: 6(-13) <br/>
<br/>
Chris Westergard: 5(+50) <br/>
<br/>
Me: 5(+50) <br/>
<br/>
Greg Hitt 4(+17) <br/>
<br/>
Barry Wright, III: 4(-17) <br/>
<br/>
Kyle Hartline: 3(+1) <br/>
<br/>
Mike Battaglia: 2(-44) <br/>
<br/>
Brandon Powers: 2(-47) <br/>
<br/>
Andrew Simon: 2(-67) <br/>
<br/>
Jesse Hartline: 0(-61)<br/>
<br/>
So since Chris and I both put in $5 in the beginning, and we both tied for 3rd in the money pool, the prize got split in half.  But thats cool, Chris played a great tourney, and he definitely deserved it.  As for the main decks I saw there, heres what I can remember.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden Base was popular for LS, as well as MBO.  I saw a Profit deck, an RST deck, and a combat deck, but thats all I remember right now.<br/>
<br/>
Huntdown was popular for dark side, as well as Set Your Course.  I saw a Watto deck, a MKOS, and of course, CCT.<br/>
<br/>
Overall Props:<br/>
Ralph Anger for running a fantastic tournament.<br/>
Kevin Elia for winning another one.<br/>
The PC for giving us another great set of virtual cards.<br/>
Barry for taking the time to do all of the official ratings stuff.<br/>
My parents for driving a bunch of us down.<br/>
Chris Westergard for playing a Watto deck with sabacc.<br/>
Brandon and Andrew for reenacting the climax of Episode IV.<br/>
Bubo for eating Yoda.<br/>
All of the guys who showed up.  MD has an amazing group of guys, and its great that all of us want to keep this game alive.<br/>
<br/>
Overall Slops:<br/>
Decree(v) for hiding.<br/>
Me for forgetting more details than I should have.<br/>
No serious slops, this was a great tournament!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks to everyone for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it.  Feel free to dmail me with any suggestions or comments.  Keep playing the greatest card game ever made, and I hope a bunch of people come to the next MD tourney this Saturday!<br/>
