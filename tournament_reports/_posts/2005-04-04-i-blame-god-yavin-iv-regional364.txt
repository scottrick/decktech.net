<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Considering I finished this tournament with three wins and three losses, I was not going to bother writing a tournament report for it. But I figure I owe my loyal devoted fans across the globe an explanation as to why the 2005 RSmith World Domination Tour got off to such a horrific start. So in the following report you will be treated to game descriptions of two games, which should provide insight into why I was unable to make top four in Maryland: because God was against me.<br>
<br>
You see, before every SWCCG tournament, I like to pray for God's blessing on my day. I pray that He would enable me to play better than anyone else, and I pray especially for good fortune in all random elements of the game, such as matchups, pairings, and luck-of-the-draw. Previously, God has been pretty f'in good about taking care of me. But on this rainy early spring Saturday in northern Maryland, God must have decided (for whatever reason) to do me in.<br>
<br>
Exhibit A: Game Three<br>
My TRM against Brian Hollingworth BHBM<br>
At this point in the tournament, I was 1-1, having lost my first game of the day with Throne Room. In that game I went up against a Scum deck, and was unable (thanks to bad luck) to deploy a single character until turn 4. That pretty much spells disaster. I only lost by 10, so I still had hopes of finishing up 5-1, and even if I lost another game by a little bit, I could still pull off a 4-2 with huge diff.<br>
<br>
This game shot all those chances to hell.<br>
<br>
I've been playing TRM almost non-stop for three years now, and so I pretty much know what I'm doing. There are certain cards I look for in my opening hand, and in my activation the first couple of turns. These cards include:<br>
Goo Nee Tay x3<br>
Were You Looking For Me?<br>
3P0<br>
Speak With The Council x2<br>
Wesa Gotta Grand Army<br>
Control/Tunnel Vision<br>
Yodas Hut<br>
Rendezvous Point<br>
Council Chambers<br>
Boss Nass Chambers<br>
<br>
Thirteen cards that can either get me going faster, or slow my opponent down while I get going. Starting six cards on table, and drawing eight, I stand a pretty f'in good chance of getting at least ONE of these cards in my opening hand (more often than not, I will get two or three). Then I can play my game from there.<br>
<br>
My opening hand against Brian had NONE of these cards. It DID have the Home One Docking Bay (a card I can search for with Insurrection, which I start), and an EPP Luke (another card I can search for, and deploy at -2 from reserve deck, with Brian's objective). UGH.<br>
<br>
So first turn I activated two. I did not want to deploy the other docking bay in my deck yet (Coruscant), so I just threw down the Home One DB and drew. Still nothing. Brian took a turn and I went and activated three. I was getting slightly unnerved so I decided to search for the Coruscant Docking Bay after all. I picked up my deck, and immediately had an epiphany. Approximately six cards up from the bottom of my deck I saw the following four cards in succession: Yoda's Hut, Boss Nass' Chambers, Rendezvous Point, and Jedi Council Chambers. ALL FOUR of my twixes, right next to each other, almost at the bottom of my deck!<br>
<br>
In case you are wondering: yes I did shuffle my deck from the previous game. Repeatedly. I continued to search my deck, and none of the aforementioned thirteen "magic" cards were in my three-card force pile. It is at this moment, when I saw those four sites stuck together near the bottom of my deck, that I knew: for this tournament, not only was God not on my side, He was against me.<br>
<br>
Anyway the rest of the game was a total drag. By the time I was able to manage force generation of more than four a turn, Brian had deployed a single battleground with roughly 24878 characters there, including Vader. I had given him the OTHER EPP Luke from my reserve deck, and he lost 1 force a turn to his objective for as long as I could keep the game going. I also caused him 5 force loss by deploying Tanus Spijek to that site (with Houjix in hand). But having had such a ridiculously bad start to the game, there was no way I could even dream of taking away his site, where he was draining me for approximately 94892 bazillion a turn.<br>
<br>
Brian won by 20-something and my hopes of competing in the finals were all but dashed. After the game, Brian said "Sorry about your bad luck." I told him it certainly wasn't his fault. Someone else had done it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Later I had Brian sign my Home One Docking Bay because it was pretty much the only card I had deployed the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That game pretty much typifies how all my games with light side went in this tournament. Though the other two were not as extreme, in ALL THREE I failed to draw a single ONE of my 13 magic cards in opening hand, save my last game with TRM were I somehow managed to get the Wesa Gotta Grand Army. On top of that, it seemed like whenever I was able to get some characters on the table and battle, every destiny I drew was an EPP or a site. As I would say: "sux0r."<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
But that, my friends, ain't the half of it. In a cruel, bitter twist of irony, God decided to bless me in my dark side games with the most ridiculously good luck I have ever seen. Exhibit B:<br/>
Game 6. My dark against Mike Burke Careful Planning (v).<br/>
My dark side deck was a Combat Readiness (v) deck that starts the Naboo system, the Theed Palace Generator Core, and the Battle Plains. Mike's light deck started the Yavin IV docking bay along with Careful Planning (v) for the system, and the War Room. He got Strike Planning, Menace Fades, and Uh-Oh! (v) for his effects, while I put down Blaster Rack (v), Combat Response, Colo Claw Fish, and Crush The Rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
My opening hand showed me Blizzard 4, Short Range Fighters combo, and some other stuff, so I played the SRF combo to get Mist Hunter (v) and then activated 10. I then spent 5 for Blizzard 4 to the Battle Plains, used its game text to get Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith (Lord Vader was in my force pile), and used Blaster Rack (v) to get Vader's Lightsaber. Then I spent 3 force and used Combat Response to get Zuckuss (v) on his ship to the Naboo system. Then I disembarked Vader and spent 1 to move him to the Generator Core, then I ended my turn and spent 1 for Blizzard 4's upkeep.<br/>
<br/>
So having not even taken a turn, Mike is staring down the barrel of a phat drain of seven, Battle Plan-proof. He got to activate a lot of force and draw a lot of cards with Drop! (v) on my turn, though, so I figured he should have something to throw at me.<br/>
<br/>
And he did. Down came Qui-Gon with Lightsaber to the Generator Core. Mike initiated, and attempted to swing, but somehow I had a Force Field in my 6-card hand. I also had a destiny 5 card that I put on the Colo Claw Fish. I swung back and hit, thanks to the Fish. And guess what else I miraculously had in my hand? Sniper &amp; Dark Strike. I lost a force to put Qui-gon into the lost pile immediately, lest Mike draw a battle destiny of 5 or greater and kill my Vader.<br/>
<br/>
My second turn I drained Mike for 7 and reinforced space with Baron Soontir Fel in Saber 1. Drew a little and got Wooof (v).<br/>
<br/>
Mike's second turn he deployed General Rieekan (v) to Yavin 4 docking bay and used him to put Haven on the system. Then he deployed Han Chewie and the Falcon there. He used Uh-Oh! (v) to deploy Gondorn Muse with Rieekan, and I believe he put a third character there as well. I pulled Firepower (v) and stacked a card on it.<br/>
<br/>
My third turn I drained for 6 (Menace Fades in effect) and revealed Wooof to get Jabba's Space Cruiser (v). I deployed them in front of The Falcon at Yavin IV. Then I used Firepower to move Saber 1 over there as well. I drew a little more.<br/>
<br/>
His third turn he drained me for one and dropped another Qui-Gon with Saber on my head at Vader's site. He initiated and attempted to swing. But I had another Force Field. I swung back and drew two big destinies and hit Qui-Gon. Believe it or not, I had my second Sniper &amp; Dark Strike in hand, so I lost a force to play that. Mike tried to Sense it, but I also had a Control in my hand. How ridiculous is that??<br/>
<br/>
So after that Mike scooped, a victim of the most insanely good luck a player has ever had. I certainly could empathize with how he felt though, having been devastated by similarly horrible luck only three games prior.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There you have it: the most disgusting roller-coaster ride of luck a SWCCG player has ever been on. I'd like to attribute it all to randomness and chance, but I know better. I know that for some sick and twisted reason, the Man upstairs decided on this fateful day to mess with me. Maybe it was punishment for sins. Maybe it was a day-late April Fool's joke. Maybe it was a test of faith. All I know is this: you don't go from having the worst luck you've ever had in 9 years of playing (and 3 years of playing the same deck) to having some of the best luck you've ever had, in three short games, without there being some sort of significance. All I can do is accept it, move on, and hope God got all His chuckles out on this one.<br/>
