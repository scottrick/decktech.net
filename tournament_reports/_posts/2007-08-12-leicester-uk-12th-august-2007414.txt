<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Following what can only be described as an "almost enthusiastic" response to the news that I had actually managed to run a SWCCG tournament a few weeks ago I was determined to not lose any momentum I had gained and so I decided to try to organise a Sealed deck tournament for August 19th.<br>
<br>
Lots of emailing / dmailing / sending messages on Facebook and the PC site followed to try to get people to commit to coming before I suddenly realised that I was going to a music festival that weekend (the lure of The Killers and Foo Fighters - not to mention the Â£200 cost of the ticket my brother had bought me as an early 30th birthday present - meant that I was definitely not going to miss that) so I had to pull it forward a week to today.  Sadly this meant I lost a few potential players but nonetheless I pressed on determined to run it if a single person from outside Leicester (since there are 3 of us here) told me that they were going to come.  It wasn't looking definite that we'd be having the tournament until 8.56pm last night when I got a phonecall to say that 2 players were coming down which would give us a minimum of 5.<br>
<br>
This morning I got to the shop nice and early and sat outside on my own for 30 minutes until the first player arrived.  We got bored and had a contructed game while we waited - my Ralltiir Ops deck vs Paul's MYWHL - I won (well, technically he drew up so we could start the tournament, but I'm sure I would have won ;)).<br>
<br>
And so with 5 players we sat down to the business of building our decks.  Considering the low number of players we opted to crack open a 4 extra boosters of Premiere each so that we could build both Light and Dark decks.  I'm not going to go into any detail about what I or the other players had, but I have to admit that I do miss opening boosters and that thrill of looking to see what the rare card is - and then the disappointment of discovering it's Red 3 and I don't have any pilot characters or Astromech Droids.<br>
<br>
Anyway, since there were only 5 of us and the games were likely to go pretty quickly we decided to play 8 games each - everyone playing the other 4 players in both matchups.<br>
<br>
So, for the record, here are the final standings:<br>
<br>
Darren Pilbeam 10(+20)<br>
James Billington 10(+4)<br>
Paul McPherson 8(+5)<br>
Chris Williams 6(+1)<br>
James Orton 6(-41)<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who came for a great day - the final standings went down to the wire with James Orton beating James Billington twice in successive games to deny him a clear victory and me beating Paul in the final game of the day in which the winner would have finished top.<br>
And once again, thanks to the great staff at Phoenix Games for allowing us use of their fantastic venue. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
