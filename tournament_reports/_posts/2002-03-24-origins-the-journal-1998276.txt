<blockquote><font class="bfont"> I was deleating my old school work tonight and found a six part journal that I wrote for a class back in 1998 after my trip to origins that year.  Enjoy!<br>
<br>
**********************************************************<br>
<br>
	On July 2nd last year, my friend John and I decided to go play in one of three Open Qualification tournaments.  The winner was to receive an all expenses paid trip and seat for the weekend of the 1998 World Championships in Virginia.  This tournament was to be on July 4th in Columbus, Ohio.  After much pre-planning by ordering a hotel 20 minutes away from the convention center that the tournament was located, getting our cards together, saying our farewells to the family, and packing our bags we went off in Johns while 1996 Honda Del Sol.  One thing I realized about the Del Sol, even though I had one and drove it a lot, I never realized how comfortable a small two seater car that it really is.<br>
	So we ended up leaving from my house in Mercerville, New Jersey at about 6 am for our seven hour trip.  We stopped for a quick breakfast and started onto our first main road, Route one.  After that we ended up going onto the PA turnpike for about 4 hours straight.  This road should have taken longer but John averaged about 85 miles per hour on this 300+ mile monster.  After that and 30 dollars in tolls less we drove in one state (I think Iowa) for about 30 minutes as we drove through the tip.  This led us into our two hour home stretch drive in Ohio.  I had never been in Ohio, but the drive had a nice view.  My only complaint on this long drive is that the superhighways are boring and if it was not for the tunnels, bridges, and landscape I would have killed the director of roads for the US Government.  Enough of the silly stuff.<br>
	We finally go to our hotel at around 1 or 2 in the afternoon with a jet lagged look upon out selves.  Before the trip, I forgot to put in my contact lenses which means that my constant reading of signs and license plates would eventually give me one hell of a headache.  We made a bet on how many different states license plates we would see on the trek.  He said 30, I said 35.  Over the course of the trip we saw 35 plates, 37 if we count the Ontario and the CA 18 wheeler plate that was abbreviated.  He did not believe that it could be a plate from that and we argued for a while about it.  Luckily nothing too heated. 8).<br>
<br>
	So we pulled into the hotel, Motel 6, unpacked our bags, got some food, and made our way to the convention center.  After we got there on Thursday afternoon, we went to pre pay and register for the weekend and for the SW tournament.  The gentleman in charge of the entire Convention (which housed thousands of different games; from card games, to board games, to role playing, to computers games, and everything else from thousands of different companies) told us that you could not register until Friday at 10 pm, which was twelve hours before the tournament.  This made me very upset because I was misinformed about being able to register for the event Thursday.  Shawn Smallman, the tournament coordinator for Decipher, told me that the event might be filled early and to get to Ohio as early as possible to register.  We did spend about $300 more by getting there Thursday instead of Friday night, which would have been fine, but it turned out to be worth it.<br>
	That night we played a few pickup games against Steven Lewis and Jim Sells who happened to be very highly ranked in the World at the time.  The playing style they had was similar to ours and that made me feel more confident.  We discussed how many of the people that are going to be here were not a good when it came to strategy.  This made me get over some of the nerves that I had and it was not even Saturday yet!  That night we went home early and got our decks tuned some more for the next days friendly preparation games versus others looking to fine tune their decks.  We also had to prepare a binder full of cards that three stars in the movie that Decipher had present to sign cards for free.  The people were David Prowse (Vader), Jeremy Bulloch (Fett), and Phil Brown (Owen Lars) and they were there on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for a few hours each.  I was able to get about 15 cards signed.  It was nice to see the characters and talk to them briefly about there careers in other films.<br>
<br>
	The tournament was about to get started, all we needed to do was fill out the cards with our information so they knew who was officially in the tournament.  After all of this happened, it took about thirty minutes, we were paired up.  Half of the people were the light side and they played the other half that were dark.  One person had a bye and automatic win because there was an odd person in the count.  I found out that the tournament had 121 people and it was the largest North American tournament ever, and second largest in the world behind a tournament in Germany.<br>
	The pairings were announced and I wondered who I would play.  I was starting to get very nervous and could not relax.  After I found out who I was playing, I became much more relaxed because I know the kid and have never lost to him.  He lives in Oxford Valley, PA, which is about 30 minutes from my house. In fact we are friends so I feel better.  I realized after the tournament that this game making me relaxed was one reason why I did so well.  I ended up winning this game against Livio and was feeling great.  I found out that of the eight people I knew there, four lost the first game.  Two of them were higher rated than me at the time and have always played well.  One was my opponent and the fourth sucked but went for the experience anyway.<br>
	The second game I played some kid that I do not remember much about.  The only thing I remember about this game was having the upperhand in the game so quickly that after ten minutes he Drew Up (lost on purpose) because he knew he could not win and we thought with the rest of the 50 minute time limit we could get some autographs from the three stars at the Decipher booth in the dealer area.  I went, but then returned to find out how my comrades made out in the second round out of six.<br>
<br>
	After seeing how my friends did in the second round I found out that I won, John won, and Joe won.  We were the only ones left of us that were still undefeated.  The third game was a memorable game more so than the others that day.  At the time of the tournament my rating was just barely about the starting rating of 1500 (I was at 1548.)  The next person I played had a small beanie baby sitting on top of the table next to him.  When I asked him about it he said that it was for good luck.  I found out that luck was definitely not with him this time.  I do not remember much about the actual game but the memorable part was after I beat him, he inquired about my rating.  After I told him, he almost cried because his rating was about 1850.  He was the highest ranked player I had ever played and he lost a ton of points because of that loss.<br>
	Updating who did what that round, I found out that John and I were the only two of us left that were undefeated.  Maybe it was the room?  Whatever the reason I felt very good about everything.  I was starting to dream about winning the tournament and getting that seat for the world championships.<br>
	Many people before the tournament were worried about cheating but then we found out that after your game you needed to hand in the decks to a Decipher representative so nothing could be changed.  Also they made the people that finished their games to wait outside the gaming area so that no on could scout what other people were using.  Word of mouth still went around with who was playing were, but there was also rumors so this was not believable and should not have been listened to.<br>
<br>
	Game four.  I thought that things could be getting tougher because the number of undefeated people was getting smaller with each round.  Before the tournament everyone was having a conversation about what record you needed after the six games to get into the two person, two game playoff that the winner earned the seat in VA.  Everyone thought that one person would go 6-0 and that the second place person would need to go 5-1 with a high differential (differential is the amount that you win by each game that is added every game.)<br>
	Before every game you count the opponents decks and he counts yours to check for marked cards and to make sure that everyone has 60 cards.  My opponent had three cards in his deck that had huge creases on the corner of each card.  In normal tournaments you could replace the cards with duplicates in better condition if you had them.  When I went to the director, I thought that he would be disqualified.  He was not, even though I could have used the free victory.  After being able to switch the cards out game commenced.  Once again I do not remember what happened exactly, except that I was the winner.  I was now 4-0 and this was the best I had ever done in a tournament.  I was gaining confidence as each opponent lost to me round after round.<br>
	Looking at how my friends we doing, my friend John finally lost his fourth round game by the smallest differential possible, one card.  This came after he won the previous game by the same mark.  I now realized that I was the lone person left of us undefeated.  Many of the worlds best players were starting to notice that this kid was coming out of obscurity to beat some good players.  It was nice to see people taking about my decks and wondering what I used in them.<br>
<br>
	Okay, now going into the last two games I realize that I am getting closer to my goal.  As the do the pairings I find out that I am now playing on the second table.  The first table had the top eight people playing in the top four games so I knew I was in the top 16 at the time.  I noticed that a few of my friends we somewhere near the last table, I had to feel bad for them.<br>
	I sat down to play this game against Ed Wearne, a guy in his mid-twenties that has ended up hating me ever since then.  If fact I played his father once who spent the whole game trying to talk trash to me.  It did not work because I humiliated him with the large win I had.  We sat down and played a game that came down to the end.  The controversial part happened when he asked my opinion of a ruling.  I answered but told him that I was not %100 sure and that he should ask the judge.  He did not ask and as I won the game he found out that I was wrong.  I told him he should have asked, but he did not and now it was too late.  While waiting to report the results I found out that even if the ruling would have gone his way he would have lost too.  I ended up wining this game by the smallest part imaginable, one card just like John earlier.<br>
	After turning in the results I went into the hallway and relaxed.  I found out where I was ranked in the tournament going into the last game.  Since the game is divided into two side light and dark, they took the highest from one side and they played the highest from the other side all the way to the bottom.  I found out that after five games I was the lone player from the light side to be undefeated.  There were three people undefeated for the dark side.  I was now feeling great about my chances to win because the deck I was about to use had only lost 8 times in over 40 games previously.  <br>
<br>
	We once again started to figure out what I needed to do so I could go to the final two game playoff. I knew that if I won, no matter what the others did, I would advance to the last game because I was the only person on that side that had not lost and my opponent was the top undefeated player for the dark side.  If I lost, I had to hope that the other two undefeated players for the dark also lose by a larger margin than me.<br>
	I went into the hallway with John and collect my thoughts with him because I relax when I talk to him.  Good friends do that plus I needed to relax.  I had a headache from the all day reading of the cards and concentrating for such a long time.  Games like this cause mental fatigue whether you prepare for it or not.  While relaxing, I went to get a Snapple, my favorite drink, to take the two Advil that I needed so badly.<br>
	After my discussion with John I went inside as they prepared for the final regular game.  At this time everyone was happy for me and starting to notice me even more.  All of the highly ranked people had lost by now and they were all wondering which of the newcomers would win.  I had a few people come up and try to give me some last minute advice about what they knew about him.<br>
	We sat down and introduced ourselves.  His name was Dave Nanninga and he was from Georgia.  He came here with his friend Zack Cowie, who was the player right below him on the dark side.  The game started and lasted about 35 minutes maybe with everyone with Decipher watching our every move to make sure everything went well.  I ended up losing the game, not sure by how much though because it was a blur.  I do remember making a gamble late in the game because I was going to lose anyway so I tried something.  It did not work and I remember a few people sigh when the gamble did not workout for me.  I was disappointed but I had to just wait and see what happened with the people below us.<br>
<br>
Fortunately I ended up being in 8th place for Origins that year for my first piece of glass.  This was the first of many thankfully.  But mainly I was there and met so many people that started me off on travelling to the big events.  I made friends that will last a lifetime...True.<br/>
