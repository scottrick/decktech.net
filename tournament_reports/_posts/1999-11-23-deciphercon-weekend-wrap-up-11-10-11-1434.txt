time around.  It was great to get some input on decks and to see him do so<br>
well this weekend.<br>
-Playing Clayton Atkin...I will let him tell you about this game 8)<br>

regional in Vermont and it was cool to see him again.<br>
-just having a hell of a time.<br>
<br>
On to my reports for some of the tournaments I played in.<br>
<br>
Ok everyone, hope I remember the things as they happen...<br>
<br>
So Kim Caton and I drive up from her place in Philly at 1pm on Wednesday<br>
expecting to be in Virginia Beach at 8ish that night.  We take a good<br>
drive all the way up passing through some tunnels (note- I hate tunnels)<br>
and stop up at the Cavalier to play a game before we pick up Jonny Chu at<br>
the airport at 11pm.  That night we meet up with Ray, Ted, Bart, Joe and<br>
everyone else from time to time.  We play a bit then go to Chu's room to<br>
test out decks.  I feel good about my light side deck because it doesn't<br>
lose.  The dark is a solid deck and I figure I can win the Wildcard by<br/>
going 7-1.  No problem, at about 5 am I crash in my room and get up for<br/>
some playing and testing around 7 am, I think.<br/>
<br/>
On to the Wildcard.<br/>
<br/>
About 150 people show up and I am feeling good.  Turns out my dark deck is<br/>
a piece of crap but my light is broken.  My dark went 2-2 with a timed win<br/>
while my light went 3-1 with my loss to Raphael Asselin (sp?) that was<br/>
helped along by my stupid move of not sacing the Lateral Damaged<br/>
Redemption while he pounded it for a loss of 20 cards in two battles.  Oh<br/>
well.  I ended up 5-3 and came in 44th place but had fun!<br/>
<br/>
I play some more games during the night including an 8-man and start to<br/>
realize the light deck is huge and that I need to add something to my<br/>
dark.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That night I stop into Clints room to see Steven and him.  Also to test my<br/>
light deck to confirm the broken aspect of it.  After a few ass whoopings<br/>
I found out that big blue that concentrates on one site and a system can<br/>
get around battle plan, thereby beating me.  I had some fun beating Clints<br/>
speeder deck though with my new revamped dark side Hunt Down 7 Destiny<br/>
Madness Deck 8).  At least I figured out how to made the light side deck<br/>
better once again. Thanks Steven.<br/>
<br/>
On to the No such thing as luck tournament.<br/>
<br/>
While everyone played in Japanese sealed, I decided to play with my new<br/>
revamped Dark Deck and my *broken* light deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game one.<br/>
<br/>
My Hunt Down and Suprise the Jedi vs Someone's LS Test 5 deck.<br/>
<br/>
This game ended in about two battles on one turn with me choking DOS and<br/>
pounding a bothan and then me taking out space with some well placed 7<br/>
destinies. Win by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two-we switch decks so I use his and he plays mine.<br/>
<br/>
I knew going into the game what weaknesses my dark had-only Zuckuss, THe<br/>
Bus, Avenger, and Tempest 2 were in the deck other than 6 vaders...If I<br/>
could beat off the meager ability in the deck I would win.  From the<br/>
first turn I scraped the Jedi Testing and started to beat down vader's and<br/>
got set up for the Kessell runs in the deck.  After a few battles in space<br/>
I started to retrieve and won the game to make it to 2-0.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three-I play my strong light side vs ISB space.<br/>
<br/>
New guy to play the next two games against.  This game was over soon<br/>
because of my ability to make him take damage from<br/>
odds, plus he had no protection.  After a while he spread out and the<br/>
beatdown followed.  Win again.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four-We switch again and I look through his deck realizing I cannot<br/>
beat my own deck due to the non-odds counters.  I did the best that I<br/>
could and only lost by 11 but it dropped me to 4th place overall.  It was<br/>
a blast though using the opponents deck.<br/>
<br/>
I Loved the No Such Thing as Luck format!  Cool idea Juz!<br/>
<br/>
OK that night I went to bed around 7am got up at 10 for the invitational.<br/>
<br/>
I dont remember much of this tournament other than playing one of my best<br/>
games of the year against TJ.  One that made us both think a little too<br/>
much.  Another Highlight was beating Assalin's (sp?) Rescue Deck late game by<br/>
circling Obi and capturing Leia with IG-88.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up coming in 7th and took home my 5th piece of glass.  It was a<br/>
cool feeling to get one.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday was the Team event and after a discussion with Kim Caton we made a<br/>
team that consisted of Ray Bordier, Woj, Kim and I.<br/>
<br/>
Game one-Dark side Huntdown vs Someguy I cant remember and his Toshi<br/>
Station.<br/>
<br/>
There were two big blows in this game.  Making him lost 16 force to a<br/>
There were two big blows in this game.  Making him lost 16 force to a<br/>
counter assault after he tried to drain with momaw, wedge, and biggs.  I<br/>
drew a 7,7, and 7 to his power 5 and that hurt.  The other big blow was<br/>
choking Ben and beating up on the lone Bomaar Monk at Tatooine.  FW by 20.<br/>
<br/>
Game two-LS Yavin IV Start Deck vs someone using Endor Operations<br/>
He was a nice guy playing a fun deck but the game was over pretty<br/>
quickly.  Not much he could do but take damage from odds. FW by 25<br/>
<br/>
Game three-DS vs a guy I cant remember revo deck.<br/>
His turn he rev'ed the Med chamber and played a nudj.  My turn played D*<br/>
and drew for Bubo, play Bubo and played vader to stop the Visage.  I was<br/>
able to turn Luke and drain for enough for the win.  Counter assault<br/>
helped add to some damage too.  FW by 10.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4-LS vs some World Qualifier guy's DS Endor Ops.<br/>
This game was over quickly as he lost to odds by the 10's.  Late game, he<br/>
spread out and the EPP's came down to kick some ass.  FW by 25<br/>
<br/>
So out of the 56 players in the team tournament I came in first and got a<br/>
set of foils.  My team :Team Ghetto: came in second place overall.  It was<br/>
my biggest win ever and was fun as hell.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it was fun 5 days and one hell of a time...See everyone at next<br/>
years.  Hopefully as a qualifier next time 8).<br/>
