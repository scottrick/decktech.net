<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Yeah, so Damian wrote a report. It was funny as you couldn't read half of it, but I'll give my take on things...<br>
<br>
Pre:<br>
Played WoW until about 1am or so and decided, hey, I need some decks. So I start looking for some other peeps' takes on EBO and SYCFA from like 6 years ago, before V cards, maintenence, episode 1, with no WYS or inserts. Finally I get my decks done about 4ish, get like 6 hours of sleep and then head up to tourney.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
EBOX - Typical 12 X-Wings, EBO stuff. Should be okay.<br>
SYCFA/Hey, look, the back! - Actually blow up Alderaan.<br>
Basically, these are the two decks I used back in the day too, so, why change?<br>
<br>
Tourney:<br>
Round 1<br>
SYCFA vs. Damian's TRMs<br>
I get a decent starting hand with Superlaser, but he gets better with Falcon, Leia and Han EPP and Harc Seff. He drops them turn 2 and moves them to D*. Well, I'm screwed right now taking damage up the butt while I try setting up. I get Lat Damage, drop it on the Falcon, he Alters, misses, then drop SD with Overwhelmed. I then get Chiraneau out and so I'm draining for like 3 for a couple turns too then he pulls his Falcon back out and I've gotta lose everything due to Damian's superior tracking skills. Also drops Corran Horn and Obi EPP to D* and I basically have to sit back and watch. I get Executor out to Fondor and move it over to Kashyyyk (maybe?) for a drain of 2. It's just too much and I come no where close to blowing up Alderaan. I get a final drain off and draw up.<br>
FL -15<br>
<br>
Round 2<br>
EBOX vs. Nick Hickey's Endor Ops<br>
I get a nice hand against this with Lost in the Wilderness and Projection of Skywalker. So, he starts by dropping Xizor to Landing Platform and I make him missing my first turn. He can't find any of his sites all game and I set up pretty fast. I get space out w/ Haven and Incom Corp and along with his sites he can't find his ships either. Tough luck for him. Finally, like turn 9 or so, he finally flips with ZiMH at Endor, while I've got like 10 X-Wings flying around doing 10+ damage a turn. Not much interaction as I was not coming down to Endor and he didn't want to come up to space (or couldn't). I finish up with All Wings for +10 retrieval.<br>
FW +22<br>
<br>
Round 3<br>
Me vs. Bye<br>
Mmmm, Burger King.<br>
<br>
Round 4<br/>
EBOX vs. Damian's SYCFA with Brangus's Brokenness<br/>
After the bye, I'm actually in second place, so I get to play Damian again. Well,  I notice that he starts Crush and pulls Evader/Monnok and plays it lost to get both of my All Wings. That blows. Well, he's got another one and pulls it next turn so now I'm screwed. I can't set up space because he'll make me lose all my X-Wings. He also gets M'iiyoon up with Brangus and now I'm taking it up the butt. He looks at my hand, makes me lose a male and can see if I have any doubles. Well, this game = autoloss for me, so I try to make the best of it. Get 2 X-Wings, 1 with Cannons out to Hoth and he drops ZiMH w/ 4-Lom, Overloads the cannons and sits at Hoth all game. I drop Haven on ALDERAAN and use it as my base of operations. I spread out pretty much as thin as possible to do as much damage, but it's just too much for me. I get Comm. Luke down w/ Saber to 4th Marker and he follows up with Vader + Tarkin. I can't get a break at all. I move away, he follows, I move back, he stays. Eventually, I have it set up to where I have EBO set up with X-Wings at D*, Alderaan, Kashyyyk, and Luke w/ saber at the Wampa Cave and doing only 3 damage because of his stupid CHYBC! Everytime I try to get a hold of 2 battlegrounds, he does something to wipe me off. It sucked balls. He was complaining that he should've had Secret Plans instead of CHYBC, but I think he would've lost the game to me if he didn't have it. I'd be doing 14 damage per turn without it.<br/>
FL - 19<br/>
<br/>
Final:<br/>
I end up 3rd out of 5 with 4pts -12, just 5 differential behind Nick Hickey's second place. Didn't really matter because it was just for fun, but it was, so that's what matters.<br/>
<br/>
Round 5:<br/>
Afterwards, Nick wants to play with his "All that was gay about old school" Light Deck, so I play my D* deck to see if I can blow Alderaan.<br/>
He's playing QMC with random jank. So, first turn, I drop Dengar EPP to CC and start draining right away. I then drop Choke Vader and disrupt him as much as I can while trying to set up the D*. I also get U-3P0 out for more fun as it takes him awhile to flip. He's playing with Grans, Arconas, Baragwins, Bargaining Table, Order to Engage, Civil Disorder, and Scramble. Bunch of jank. My D* can almost never set up, but I do control space pretty well. He drops Dash in Outrider early, but I get him easily with Thrawn + Chimaera. He gets Wedge on Rogue Sq. 1 and one of the Green Sq. guys or Tala guys or something crazy like that up in space and holds me off a little bit, but I do what I can. I spread out thin trying to do damage as I can't find any Gunners or Laser. Eventually, I get everything I need, but it's too late. I move over to Alderaan and he drains me out, but we play one more turn to see if I can do it with my 1 force left. I try and come up 1 short since he has guys on the D* too. Oh well. It was fun anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Overall:<br/>
This was a "Classic" tournament and was meant to be fun. Well, it was a lot of fun to me as I enjoyed going back to my roots as these were the decks I played in my first tournament some 5 years ago or so. Great fun.<br/>
