<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well I showed up a couple of minutes past the 9:30 advertised date, pulled into the parking lot and saw John, Michael, and Billy. We started talking for a while, John revealed that he in fact sent emails stating 9:30 in order to get Travis and Joe to arrive on time for once, after a short amount of time talking someone noticed a pair of people cutting things in their car, we walked on over and sure enough it was Travis and Joe who had been there since well before I arrived. After entering the bookstore we wandered on back to our usual spot and started the usual pre-game chatting which unfortunately resulted in the new joke for Florida states, "check his room" which, about me, referred to myself making asinine comments about X deck or whatever. Since my Father and I play in tournaments together this was spoken to my Dad most of the time, and was great fun for everyone. I Decided that i would be playing Black Sun and a self-modified version of my Yavin 4 CPv that is posted here, basically i removed 8 cards and replaced them with more senses alters and controls and honor.<br>
<br>
First Round: My Yavin Four CPv Vs Michael Faughn's Dark Senate<br>
This game started out with him placing sidious at his office and drawing. I responded by attacking with Obi Wan JK (V) and his saber i drew a total of six (Your insight making him DV 6) on my saber draw missing him, i prevented obi from being hit with his gametext and succeeded in making michael lose a couple of force in overflow and killing off my obi who was brought back to hand and his saber placed in used. The game continued this way with myself draining him and sending jedi to kill sidious (never happened) but causing him to lose a total of 10 or 11 force throughout the game. ended up as a drain race and myself winning out FW + 8<br>
<br>
Round two: My AOBS Vs Joe LaPorta's WHTv<br>
I was worried about this deck going into this tournament since black sun tends to have issues removing jedi and this deck running nothing but, Joe has played this deck against me before and i've never won. I overcompensated for that fact when i built my deck. First turn I Deployed a couple characters and saved up to flip the second turn, since honor was on table no need to rush. This game ended up being won due to Joe's persistance in attacking me and the inability of his jedi to hit my DV 6-7 Bounty Hunters. he just ran out of jedi and my heavy drains due to Watto(V) and Guri won it out. FW + 20<br>
<br>
Round three: AOBS vs Travis Cooper's WHAPv<br>
Well I knew if i Beat travis i would have a shot at winning the tournament since i would not be playing John's darkside the next game, if i lost i likely would be playing John and would almost certainly lose that game. I had two options here, one was to use my character removal to stock a ton of clones in prison in order to eliminate them as a threat, the other was to try to outdrain him while removing his ability to flip. I tried the second option after seeing my starting hand. First turn i played Reegesk (V) and Shada to the prison and waited (this was my first mistake, not playing Death Star Sentry (V)) His turn he deployed a site and drew two cards. My turn I deployed Jodo Kast with a weapon put a weapon and some mandalorian armor (V) on shada and played Watto (V) and flipped. His turn he played 5 clones against shada and Reegesk, now this was played wrong he deployed them as a group and i should have been able to have an action in between, but I didn't protest it and we moved on (even though i would have prevented two of those clones from being deployed) he didn't battle and relied on the threat of clones and my small hand size to save him. It worked and i retreated to the Docking bay, while putting Boba Fett and Guri down with Xizor and draining for three and causing him to lose force. I drew into my Elis Heirlot and i stocked my hand full of battle removal just in case. He responded by flipping and nebruning out to a second site. at this point i had stolen HCF and Obi in radient VII with Reegesk, and had i just given up on Scum i would have won the game but i thought i needed that retrieval so i dumped HCF and Obi the next turn to drains along with a spaceport DB. Then I drained again and he lost his second HCF, at this point i could have made it my priority to steal his last chance in space but i decided against pulling a shield to prevent it, he ditched wokling the next action to save his chances. That ended up being the key play as i couldnt get any of my space except Ig-88 who is a useless card for any deck alone. he set up in space and drained me out myself capturing many clones and playing hidden weapons three turns in a row (it being sensed twice)and finally getting him to flip back way too late, i tried to deal as much damage as possible but it never worked out, i had Dagobah Cave on table since turn 1 and he had played Yoda MOTF (V) on his third turn, i never made him lose force to it the entire game all 10 of his turns after. I was left with one force left and him taking the last actions before a timed game and he tried to get the beatdown but ended up with exactly the overflow that i had forfeit and it was a timed loss for 25 for me.<br>
<br>
Round Four Yavin 4 vs John's EOPS<br>
At this point i had resigned myself to defeat in this game as vehicles are the decks weakness, although i was killed by not having ultimatum underneath my SE and that would have saved me from his drain of four all game as i quickly got three battlegrounds. he drained me out and battles amounted to nothing, a pretty boring game that he made a clutch decision to quick flip and STILL protect ozzel had he not IL-19 and Leia were in my starting hand and would have sent ozzel on a beatdown. I got to space too late and was unable to keep up without Ultimatum FL 20<br>
<br>
Round Five: BYE<br>
At this point i needed John to beat Travis and then lose his 6th game in order for myself to advance to 2nd place, this did not happen so i decided to go for the gusto on my round 6 game which turned out to be:<br>
<br>
Round 6: AOBS vs Michael's Profit.<br>
I decided to start Snoova and Shada as my two Aliens since together they have quite a bit of power and snoova can get his own weapon. First turn i play reegesk and jodo Kast to the audience chamber and watto with Xizor to flip. He places Master Luke and Leia Rebel Princess across my alien mess, and played artoo and Threepio (V) at Jabba's Palace and used Threepio to get a new hand. 2nd Turn I Watto'd Drew Elis Heirlot into my hand as a result, deployed Guri to Xizor's Location and 4lom w/ gun, Dr E and Ponda and a naboo blaster rifle(on jodo) to the audience chamber, elis'd over and battled. this was the game for Michael as a he was unprepared for the beatdown on the second turn. Xizor, Guri, Jodo (with a +4 gun), Dre E, Reegesk, 4LOM w/ gun, Shada, Snoova With Axe, Watto vs Master Luke and Leia with a lightsaber and lightsaber proficiency. I cancelled master Luke's Gametext and he hit xizor, i tried to exclude leia and failed, then shot and operated on her, added a destiny with Jabba's Through with you, and Oota Goota Solo V and played Frustration (V) he had to lose luke and his hopes of flipping and A Gift as a result, ending his chances to win the game, the game progressed with drains outside of the chamber and eventually a final beatdown. FW +30.<br>
 All and all going third isnt bad, it's just upsetting knowing you let a winnable game slip through your hands and it cost you 2nd place. Congrats to travis for winning and to john for doing his best since i've been playing with his.  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
