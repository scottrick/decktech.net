It is the fourth tournament there.<br>
<br>
The Draft:<br>
<br>
This was my third time drafting with the cube, all 3 of them Light Side for some reason, hoping to be DS next time !!  My first pack has Obiwan with Lightsaber, which is good, but then I really saw no mains till the last pack.  I got Kebyc, Pucumir in pack 2, so by then I am basically set in building a CC based ground deck to drain with light space support.  In the last pack, I actually got a 3rd pick card of Leia (v), which I passed for Lobot (v) given my strategy, that must have been some pack (I believe it was Master Luke, Wedge, Leia and Lobot and a few more good cards).  My starting location is Rendez-Vous Point, I only pack the 2 cloud city sites as other locations, space package is Tantive 4 (v), 1 Correlian Corvette and 3 x Gold Squad Y-Wings.  My deck is packed with 2 power 2 ability characters and a few very useful aliens (other then those mentioned above) Bron Burs, Melas, Caldera, Harc Seff, Hnmethe and 2 Palace Raiders with one Patrol Craft and one Skiff.  Special props to the TD, Patrick Dinelle, who as always ran a great tournament, especially the draft, which, on-line, is not easy to get through.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: Vs Jan Westerguard, Dagobah Cade / Imperial Domination start.<br>
<br>
Jan has the best deck I have yet to see in Cube draft, ever And is a very good player, Imperial Domination, when drafted early, is overpowered in Cube because of the retrieval.  I was expecting a quick and painless loss, but then I drew my opening hand;<br>
<br>
Gold Squad Y Wing<br>
Projection of Skywalker<br>
Ultimatum (v)<br>
EPP Obi<br>
Lieutenantant Natan and<br>
<br/>
Kebyc (v) !!<br/>
Pucumir    !!!<br/>
Hnmethe   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The one card that gave me a chance in that matchup, I drew in opening hand, the Hnmthe (male imperials, which was 100% of my opponents character, deploy +2 to same and adjacent site).  Jan activates 3, deploys Desert heart and Mos Eisley, draws a few.  I grab Casino from reserve, deploy Kebyc, Hnmethe and Pucumir, draw the rest.  Jan needs to save up for a few turns to deploy to my area so I drain for 2, he sets up a drain of 2 himself at Sullust, I reinforce with Caldera, so now he cant deploy too much and battle.  He drops a Walker, Igar, Cabel and Janus (I think this was the only mistake he did all game) so he could not battle (more then 7 ability) and spent 20 force doing that.  From there, I occupy one more battle ground then him all the time and start spreading to different locations to drain.  Game basically ends when a few Aliens, Palace Raider and Craft overflow a lone Walker at the Casino for 6 force from Reserve.  FW by 11.  In retrospect, drawing the Hnmethe early was really the only chance I had in this game, I think I also played it just right, experience in draft and cube really helped me here.  I fully expected Jan to go 3-0 from here, which he did, but he lost out on differential to Adam as top DS player.<br/>

Game 2 Vs Darren Pilbeam<br/>
<br/>
I start Rendez-Vous Point, he starts Kessel with Twilek for Imperial Arrest Order.  While my hand is not has great as in game 1 (it really could not be) I still have a very good hand, with Melas, Palace Raider, Skiff, and again the Hnmthe as highlights.  Turn 1, he deploys Docking bay 94, draws 1 and says go.  On my turn, I search for my battle ground, grab the Casino, notice that Kebyc and EPP Obiwan are not in reserve, draw 5 (including Tantive (v) and DTF).  On his turn, he deploys two 2/2 imps to Casino, turns out that set him back so much he could not recover.  On my turn, I deploy Kebyc, Hnmethe, Melas and 2/2 rebel pilot, Draw their Fire, battle, he looses one, be both draw 5s for BD, he looses one imperial, I loose Melas and Rebel.  He is only activating 5 force, so he cant reinforce and battle (because of Kebyc and Hnmethe) for fear of having a lone guy get beatdown on my turn, so he keeps dropping one guy a turn.  This goes one for another 4 turns before I sadly clear him off.  By then, I have one card in lost pile to his 12 or so.  He plays imp reinforcement and retrieves 4, deploys Tatooine and a few ties at Kessel.  I deploy Tantive + 2 pilots to Kessel, battle, DTF, he plays All Power to Weapons, we both loose nothing cause he has no destiny and I draw low, I move.  The rest of the game was him draining for 1 or 2, then moving his fleet to where Tantive was to avoid a drain of 3 from me while I was draining for 1 on CC (never drew Pucumir all game, but did draw him 3 times for Destiny), deploying a pilot of Gold Squad Y-wing to Tantive location, battling, DTF swing of 2, and moving to the other system.  Well played by Darren, after he deployed first to my location, there was not much else he could do.  FW by 18.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs  Adam Radic<br/>
<br/>
I start Rendez-Vous Point, no starting effects, Adam starts Coruscant. I draw into Lobot and Hnmthe and a bunch of crap.  Hnmethe served me so well in games 1 and 2 I decide not to Mullgian, Adam goes ahead and redraws his hand.  He deploys Mos Eisley, draws.  I pull Casino, see Pucumyr and Tantive (v) are activated, drop Casino, draw a few.  Adam deploys Lars Farm, draws a few.  I deploy Lobot, Pucumir and Hnmthe to Casino, say go.  He deploys a few imps to Lars farm.  We exchange drains of 2 for a few turns.  I setup the other CC site, so I have 2 x drains of 2, he sets up drains at Mos Eilsly (with Bane), Farm and Audience Chamber (with Xizor), so 4 for him as well.  I then go to Coruscant with tantive and a few pilots, he had been loosing ships to drain for the last few turns so I took my chances.  He comes to CC with Mighty Jabba, Boelo and Gela and clears one site, moves to the other.  So now I only drain for 2 to his 4, I deploy dtf, a few guys to lars farm to negate his biggest drain, projection mos eisley, battle at Casino and Lars Farm (retrieve 2 / he looses 2), we do that for a few turns (reinforce Casino and Farm, battle, loose / retrieve).  In the end, I have 5 force left at the beginning of my turn, he has 7.  I drain for 2 at Coruscant, 2 at CC 2/1 interior site, battle at lars farm (retrieve 1, he looses 1) with Bron Burs where I knew his destiny was 3, power 8, so I looses 1, loose the battle and Bron but he covers, leaving me with 6 force and him with 2.  He has a drain of 5 setup next turn, with none of my characters left to battle for DTF.  He drains for 5, moves Jabba, says go, I drain for 2 at Coruscant, FW by 1.  Very good game, solid deck by Adam, with a very strong space package that I never saw cause he had to use all his forces on the ground (lucky for me cause he had Jabbas ship with lots of pilots (Outer Rim Scout, Woof, Gela, to go with Mist Hunter V and Punishing one V, a Dreadnaught and a few ties). <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Dannie Appleburry<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I know I am going to be LS rep into the final confrontation.  I start Rendez-Vous Point, BAU, Danny starts Audience Chamber.  Opening hand reveals Lobot, Pucumir, Obi EPP and crap, but thats good enough to keep.  We deploy sites and draw a few on turn 1.  On turn 3, I deploy to his Tatooine with Tantive (v), a Gold Squad Y Wing + Pilot hoping to get a drain of 3 for a few turns.  He comes in with Judicator, Ozzel, Were in attack position and laser cannon and shoots down my space, I give up after a few turns and focus on setting up ground drains.  I deploy a second CC site, Pucumir, Lobot, EPP Obi to setup drain of 2 and then 4.  He never came to CC and I disturbed him enough on Tatooine that my drains did him in.  I took a few damage from his admiral order (commanders on ground) to make it close.  Changing the odds (v) was big in a key spot for me late game, both playing it to prevent opponent from getting a destiny and then tracking it to clear the site next turn.  Dannie tracked a Tatooine DB he had draw for weapon destiny to overload EPP Obi which was very cool. FW by 6.<br/>
<br/>
I am the only player at 4-0 on both sides, and represent LS in the final confrontation, rematch again Adam, which was a very close game I won by 1 force and could have lost.  Rematch will be interesting in Draft, since we both saw pretty much 100% of each others deck since the game was so close.<br/>
<br/>
Final:  Me LS vs Adam DS:<br/>
<br/>
Rematch of game 3, which was as close as could be.  Same start for me,  same start for him, non descript hand (Kebyc is in there, so I keep it).  He activates and draws, I activate, pull Casino, draw.  He deploys A. Chamber, lower passages and uses Chamber text for Xizor.  I deploy Kebyc and a few Rebel Scouts to Casino, we both drain for 1 a few times, he deploys Lars Farm and Greedo, moves Xizor over.  I deploy EPP Obi and a few guys, battle slash Xizor.  Pivotal moment, he comes down with a crowd of guys, Hermi with Stun Blaster, battles, fires at Obi, with Hermi, Farm Text, he needs a 3 to bounce Obi for a huge beatdown, draws a 2 (no allot of Ds higher then 2 in his deck so chances are on my  side).  Had he targeted Jek, he would have cleared Obi to attrition and the game would have gone differently for sure.  I slash Hermi, he never ended up taking the Farm back.  I deploy Pucumir and Tantive at his Coruscant late game to increase my drain by 4, he cant do much by then.  FW by 13.  <br/>
