<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament from Turlock,CA what else to say??<br>
<br>
pre-tourny<br>
Right after last weeks tourny I decided I needed a new dark side deck...  I looked<br>
around and came up with a few ideas.  I was gonna first go with Dark Deal since it is<br>
a good deck and can match up well against QMC which people will be playing...Or a <br>
Senate Manip with the shaft... I start to make the dark deal then decide against it.<br>
I make the Senate deck which is preety nice lots of manip iwht oonith and Defensive fire.<br>
FUN.  I finish that up and tune the LS combat deck some adding a Suppetitious Glance <br>
for Dark Deal so right after they deploy before they filp i can jack their @$$.  Ive<br>
been talking to Clayton "dadohman" Akins again during the week and im planning on <br>
getting a ride from him.. everything is set and ready to rock......  We plan on meeting<br>
at IHOP on sunday at around 12.  We get there and its pouring rain and the IHOP is <br>
packed.. church just got out.  Well I wait around for a while and Clayton shows up<br>
with his little kid and were off.  We talk tech the way up there but...... he forgot <br>
to bring the shaft for me that i didnt have.......its cool though..  When we get there<br>
I scramble to try and find one but I cant.  So i change decks right there back to <br>
Lightsaber combat.... again running the same 2 decks..... but thats cool.  We start<br>
off and have 8 COOL.....<br>
<br>
Decks<br>
LS:  Saber combat that 0wnz j00<br>
DS:  Saber Combat Racing that gets 0wned<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs John Mendozas Dark deal with No Obj<br>
<br>
Well what more to say.... This was a kid(kinda old) and didnt have all the cards.  I got<br>
a descent start with Jedi Council with Luke and Threepio in hand and some evasion.  First<br/>
turn he drops CC Casino with Mara and Saber there.  I play Goo Nee Tay and tunnel vison <br/>
for Jedi Relisence and deploy Luke vs Mara.  I miss the hack(wtf) and draw a 1(wtf) but<br/>
he has to lose a few force and I relensence him back to my hand.  He drains for 2... and <br/>
I lose another Relensence(crap).  He sends Zuckuss to Bespin and is untouched drain for 1<br/>
rest of the game.  Again a send Luke down against mara along with Threepio to Jedi Chamber<br/>
to start my tracking.  I hit mara and draw a 7 for Mara and 4 more... finally.  I finally<br/>
draw Qui-Gon.  He draws up on his turn.  I get Yoda to Generator and Qui to the core with<br/>
his saber.  He attempts an attack against quigon... guess he didnt read the site text or<br/>
my objective.  Iggy, Dengar and Veers come down where I it can wait iggy and barrier Dengar.<br/>
My turn I death finger Dengar and fight Veers.... Slice and send him down the shoot.  Iggy<br/>
comes back on his turn and Elises him to the Jedi Chamber as Tempest Scout 5 goes to Casino<br/>
alone...  I track a 7 to the top and send Obi after him.  I draw my tracked 7 and he loses<br/>
the Tempest and some breakthrough.  He drains for 1 at the System and plays an exterior<br/>
2:1 site and plays Lord Vader for 10 and Veers for 5.  Me being a nice guy I tell him<br/>
he cant drain at Vaders site cause of my Obj but he re-deploys them against Obi instead.<br/>
Mace comes down and Obi and Mace makes quick work of them with some high destiny and loses<br/>
more breakthough.  After that my drains of 6 take him out.  FW(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning a game that was going horrible.<br/>
Lows:  Nothing... deck is slow for some odd reason.......<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs Peter Nordstroms Pod Profit<br/>
<br/>
Not a good matchup for my deck.... I start Blaster Rack instead of the Box and Jabba Xizor <br/>
in AC.  I get a Preety Good hand with Maul and the card that pulls the bridge.  I flash <br/>
Anakin and Play the bridge.  He starts Goo so Maul doesnt make and appearance.  I draw up <br/>
some.  He activates and Plays Lars farm and drops EPP Luke to the Generator.  I draw destiny <br/>
and get some crappy desitny and he ahead after a step backwards the first draw.  I drop maul <br/>
against Luke but he gets Barriered.  I draw the rest.  He messes maul and drains for some.  <br/>
He plays Jar Jar to the core and Luke moves over.  We race and I set up my hand for some<br/>
beats with Iggy going the the AC for backup.  HE stacks more in the Core with Corran and <br/>
That guy who &gt;8 ability for battle and Chewie Enraged.  He wins the race but doesnt retrieve<br/>
due to my serect plans and i Lose 4 with the Dshield.  Vader and his saber goes to Emps <br/>
site for backup.  He drains and drops a Famba along with Battle Plains.  I send Maul with<br/>
Saber with his double to the battle plains and I draw the luckiest 2 cards in the world.<br/>
I get a I have you now(explained later) and counter assault.  I know I have a 7 on top so<br/>
since I have nothing better to do I gamble and counter assault the site.  I draw the 7,5,5<br/>
6,4 for 29 to his 22.  So he loses 7.  He then attacks Maul with Obi-with Saber.  I force<br/>
field his hack and he blaster deflects 1 and i pay for the too close that he played.  I <br/>
hit Obi and plays Maul stirkes and I have you now.  I draw 1,2,7 but he has to lose 7 more.<br/>
I guess 7s are lucky.  I end up draining him out in a few turns.  FW(+16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Lucky<br/>
Lows:  Deck Sucks<br/>
<br/>
2nd place going against.......suspence kills<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
LS vs Clayton "dadohman"s Senate/conduct your search/clo claw fish/Crush<br/>
<br/>
This is the matchup I wanted since I have confidence in my LS deck.  I get a ok draw with<br/>
the Jedi Chamber and Luke as my characters.  He starts the core so I convert his site.<br/>
First turn he grades a I have you now and puts it on the fish and draws the rest.  I play <br/>
my site and tunnel and he plays his grabber shield.  I draw up the rest to 12 cards since<br/>
hes packing crush.  He flips this turn with Aks Moe and someone else(not yeb or lotti) and<br/>
plays Bar Game along with the backdoor with conduct search.  Qui comes down with his saber.<br/>
He attacks with Vader with saber.  I try to dodge but it gets sense.... I sense back but<br/>
draw a fricking 7... garbage.  So mine gets sensed and I have to fight.  He h4X0rs my <br/>
guy down and I miss and I get to lose some force.  So qui dies but i got a backup in my<br/>
hand.  He stacks up in the senate but keeps drawing since Lotti Doddi(we like to party) <br/>
isnt out yet.  Qui comes back with his saber and Mace(got the ladies) goes to the<br/>
Generator.  He finallys gets Lotti doddi out and Ability x3.  Crap.  Im playing for my<br/>
drains of 4 and keeping my hand size up.  I play Obi with Stick to the Back door packing <br/>
Houjix just in case.  Sidious comes down against Obi and battles.  I hack him up and he<br/>
I have you now which clears us both out... I jedi relinsence back to my hand.  HE puts <br/>
cards back and drains for 1.  Drops a few senators into the senate and draws more.  I pay<br/>
for drains and drop bousssh into the Senate to Block the drain and cover Ability x3.  <br/>
My drains are starting to do damage and picking off his deck.  I drop Luke on my turn with<br/>
Mace to cover Ability x3 and hit a Edge for 6.  After a long activate phase he drops Maul<br/>
with sabera against Mace and Luke.  I it can wait but he senses it.  This messes up his <br/>
plan some.  He hacks up Luke and plays I draws destiny with adding with Toonbuck clears<br/>
my site.  I drop Obi to the Generator but his turn he kills him with Ponda dr E.  After<br/>
that he moves some senators into the Council Chamber and I follow with Bousssh.  He hits<br/>
me for a few from Ability x3 and drains in the Senate but my drains kill him off.  <br/>
FW(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Having a good game with Clay<br/>
Lows:  Beating him by alot<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
DS vs Again Claytons QMC<br/>
<br/>
We were talking decks and he thought this could be a bad matchup.  He starts the goods with<br/>
Meance fades to kill my Maul drain.  I draw all 3 mauls in my opening hand.  I dont flash<br/>
I draw a 3 destiny and play maul with his stick(blaster rack from hand casue i started box)<br/>
and didnt get the bridge even though I had the card.  I pulls a site from his deck and dash<br/>
in the outrider goes to the system.  I drain for 4 with maul and podrace for a  descent <br/>
destiny.  He drops Han with Blaster to cover for meance fades after pinging me.  I drain <br/>
for 2 and Podrace.  I drop DVDLOTS without saber in front of han but he paths away.  Chewie<br/>
Enraged and Leia with blaster comes down against Vader and paths han over.  I choke out<br/>
Han and I lose vader and a few cards where he loses chewie.  I drain for 2 and race but<br/>
have 24 to his 15 or so.  Jek comes down and sets up CC Cele and he plays the Grabber<br/>
D Shield and Wise Advice.  And the Battle Plan Shield.... theres all 3 shields.  Weird.<br/>
I have Janus at the race arena tracking destiny as I win the race this turn and Cancel his<br/>
Cele with Masterful combo which he grabs.  I win the race and he loses his other Cele off<br/>
the top.  I play Serect Plans and leave Janus there alone.  He drains for 3 and grabs a<br/>
card.  HE draws up some.  I drain for 3 and drop Emperor with Janus.  Qui-gon comes down<br/>
against them but he doesnt battle as he sets up a few maneuvers on the top of his deck.  <br/>
I drop DVDLOTS with his Saber but he gets barrierd.  I let him go as he drains me.  He <br/>
battles with Corran as backup.  HE hacks up Janus since i ommni boxed his deck.  <br/>
He coulda hit either.  I choke out Corran and miss the hack on Qui-Gon.  He drains and <br/>
draws some and hits a off the edge for 5.  I use Xizor to Clear out Leia.  As I Kill<br/>
Jek a turn later with some characters for the game.  FW(+27)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning No prizes<br/>
Lows:  Not much<br/>

Well since none of us payed money for it... but its cool.  I decide to buy a few packs<br/>
anyways since I didnt spend any of my parents money(hehe) I get 3 packs of Theed and 1 of<br/>
Coursant.  I see Clayton running around looking for Queen Amidala ruler of Naboo... <br/>
Brokenness!!!!!!! So i buy my packs and we head off.  He goes Hey man if you get a Queen<br/>
send it my way... but then he said ahh nevermind you only bought 1 Coursant.  So I <br/>
Open the coursant first and guess what it was.... QUEEN AMIDALA AI... preety crazy eh..<br/>
