<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Alright, guess I should write up a TR for this epic weekend in San Diego. This event was announced shortly after I got back from the MPC and was supposed to be the first of 2 mega-tournaments this summer, one in San Diego, run by Chris, Aaron, and Kevin, and one in Boston run by KToD. At first I thought, great Ill have a big Boston event to go to this summer along with Kashyyyk Regionals, MA States, Yavin 4 Regionals, and Worlds, and thats a solid year. Then my plans just started getting blown out in succession.  For those of you who dont know, Im an Orthodox Jew, and Judaism has 11 holiday days a year where there is no way I can go to any events over those days. 4 of those days this year are the 2 days of the Y4 weekend and days 2 and 3 of Worlds. So looks like I cant go to either of those events. Then, KToD decides to drop out of the game shortly before Y4 to play Magic (although now it sounds like theyre coming back for Worlds) but the result of this is that the Boston scene falls apart and there arent even Regionals or States in MA this summer let alone a mega-event. So now its looking like Im going to need to travel if I want to be able to play in any SWCCG events for the rest of the year. Ive always wanted to go to Comic-Con so the San Diego tournament was high on my list. I bought a badge for the Con in April but the problem was I still hadnt lined up a job for the summer and at that point I was a little more focused on hitting up as many Phish shows over the summer as I could than traveling to play SWCCG. I dumped about $1000 on tickets/hotel/traveling for 3 Phish shows over a weekend in March and another $400 for 5 more shows over the summer, so I was kinda broke, and not thinking there was any way I could get to Comic-Con. I got back to Boston from Maryland the last week in May and saw Phish play Fenway Park on 5/31, before heading down to New York for the 6/2 show on Long Island. I was supposed to hit up 6/4 on Long Island and then 6/7 in Philly too, but on 6/3 I got offered a job interview back in Boston on 6/4 so I sold my 2 remaining tickets to my friend and headed home. I started work on 6/5 and now had a solid paycheck and, with only one more Phish show I could make it to that summer could think about turning my newfound source of income to other pursuits. Problem was, I wasnt exactly making a lot of money, and that money would have to support me for probably the rest of the year once I was back at school so I couldnt really blow too much on cards. I looked online and found that AirTran had a one way flight from Boston to San Diego for $150 and that I had enough AirTran credits from all my Boston-Baltimore flights that I take to get to and from school for a free ticket on the return trip (business class no less). Problem was I still couldnt afford $100 a night or whatever it was going to be for a hotel room. Then, Aaron Nelson stepped up like a champ (foreshadowing there) and offered to get hotel rooms for everyone coming to San Diego free of charge which was an incredible offer and made it possible for me to go. I book my flight and I get into San Diego Thursday morning. Chris Schoenthal says he can pick me and Brian Fred up from the airport and then take us to the con on Thursday. Problem is my badge is for Friday and all badges are sold out, so I go online and get real lucky and get a re-release badge on Tuesday afternoon for Thursday and dont have to pay the ridiculous $150 a badge that people were asking on Craigslist and eBay.<br>
<br>
THURSDAY<br>
<br>
I wake up at 4AM after going to sleep at 1 which sucks. I head to the airport for a 6AM flight and pass out as soon as I get on the plane. I have to switch planes in Milwaukee which wakes me up and I cant really fall back to sleep on the 2nd flight, so Im still pretty tired. I get to see some crop circles, the Grand Canyon, and the Rocky Mountains on the way to California. Ive never been to Cali or anywhere on the West Coast before so getting to see the Pacific Ocean from the air for the first time was also pretty cool.  Landing in San Diego was one of the sweetest landings in any city Ive ever been in. You swoop in low over the mountains and then come over the residential part of the city before heading downtown and if youre on the left side of the plane you have an amazing view of downtown at eye level as you fly past and land just beyond it. I get off the plane and its around 11 local time (2PM my time) and meet up with Chris and Steve Jones. Chris goes to get Brian Fred and we all head for Chris house which is only about 5 minutes from the airport and Im thankful for the short drive and just being able to be outside after the long flight. Chris lives in between Bob St. and Xenophon St. which I think are two of the coolest street names Ive ever seen. We chill at Chris for a few minutes and then head to get some food along with Chris wife Liz.  Now, another part of being Jewish is that I keep Kosher. This came up a lot over the weekend and a lot of people werent really sure what it meant. What this means pretty much is that I dont eat meat and dairy together, and I dont eat anything that comes from pig, or any fish that doesnt have fins and scales (no lobster, crab, shrimp, etc.). In addition, all food preparation must be supervised in order for it to be certified as Kosher (theres no Rabbis blessing involved, its just an issue of supervision to make sure everything is ok).  Most foods that you find in the supermarket are certified Kosher and I can eat them no problem. Restaurants however do not have Kosher supervision and I cant eat at 99.9% of American restaurants (most major cities with Jewish populations have a few Kosher restaurants). I actually brought an entire suitcase of food with me on the trip cause I knew I wouldnt be able to eat much of what I found in San Diego. Anyway, we stop at some fast food burger place and I get to see how a drive-through works cause Ive only been through one like 2 or 3 times before, possibly all at SWCCG tournaments. While hes eating, Brian Fred realizes he doesnt have a Thursday badge and was going to use Kevin Shannons but Kevin hasnt picked his up yet. Chris drops Brian back at his house and the rest of us head to the con. Comic-Con is really undescribeable. Id been to plenty of comic-cons before in various cities but this just screams bigger and better. The costumes that people wear hear completely blow away anything Ive seen anywhere else. The exhibit hall floor takes a good 5-10 minutes to walk from one side to the other without stopping (although despite that I still never found a single person selling SWCCG). The first thing I do when I get to the con is check the time against my schedule (youll never get anything done at comic-con unless you have a schedule). Its 1:15 and I get in the autograph line for comic book artist Leinil Francis Yu who is scheduled to do signings at 2. Im the 5th or 6th person in line which is surprising since at most cons the lines close over an hour before the signings. Comic-Con however is less about the comics and the comic book lines arent as bad since half the convention is upstairs at this point waiting for Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. At about 1:30 one of the staffers working the Marvel Comics booth where the signing was taking place said that Yu was running late by about half an hour. This staffer was awesome and you could tell he was just a hired guy who had never read a comic in his life, but he was around both days I was at the con and was a very cool guy and one of the best customer service people Ive seen. So were waiting for Yu and theres this hot girl at the Marvel booth giving away fake business cards for Stark Industries and shes smiling at everyone. Were waiting and Yu doesnt show up (but I get his colorist Laura Martin to sign a bunch of his stuff, and shes real nice and apologetic and says she doesnt know where he is) and this girl is still standing there smiling and Im thinking that must be so painful to hold a smile like that for hours on end, but at least I have something to look at while Im in line. And of course there are random Catwomen and Elektras walking by all the time. There was a Silk Spectre I that I ran into a few times that day who was just beyond gorgeous. Dennis Miller and his son also walk by while were in line. Its 2:50 and theres still no sign of Yu and everyone is waiting for him so someone volunteers to go check his artist alley table and see if hes there. He is, and says hell come right over. He shows up at about 3:05 and sees the big line of people that have been there for almost 2 hours now, but proceeds to go and stand off to the side talking to one of his friends for another 15 minutes. At 3:20 he begins signing and says that he needs to cap the number of books per person in order to keep the line moving. He says he asked to move the signing back from 2 to 3 and was told no, so he just decided to move it back anyway. So at about 3:30 I finally get my stuff signed, and head off to explore the con. I find Chase Masterson (Leeta from Deep Space Nine and rumored companion of Warren Holland) in the autograph area with one of the lowest cut shirts Ive ever seen. George Lazenby is also there and Im still not really sure why but I throw away $20 on an autograph and handshake from the worst of all the James Bonds. I head back down to the convention floor and do a little more browsing and come across Lou Ferrigno and Peter Mayhew. Im playing Wookiees this weekend so I decide to drop another $20 to have Peter sign my Chewbacca of Kashyyyk. Problem is I forget to tell him to sign on the picture.  He signs on the text and the whole weekend I play with the card flipped and the V-text covering the top of the card instead of the bottom so the autograph is visible. Next up I find a Star Trek booth with Garrett Wang (Harry Kim from Voyager), Nicole DeBoer (Ezri Dax from DS9) and Robert Picardo (The Doctor from Voyager). The doctor was always my dads favorite Voyager character and his birthday is coming up next month so I drop another $20 to have Picardo sign an autograph to him. Picardo looks pretty much the same as he did on the show, Wang and DeBoer have both aged pretty badly.  I stop by the Wizard booth and see Daniel Logan (young Boba Fett from Episode 2) talking with an 8-year old whos at the booth by himself. The 8-year old clearly doesnt realize the concept of fiction and is asking Daniel if he can get him a lightsaber and to go find some Jedi.  Daniel (whos only 15 or 16) is trying to humor the kid as much as possible but eventually starts getting fed up and you can tell hes trying to get rid of the kid, but he cant actually say anything mean, and its just really funny watching this little 8-year old try Boba Fetts patience and Fett being unable to do anything about it. I hear some commotion and it turns out Tyrese Gibson from Transformers has gotten up on a table and just started yelling random crap to attract attention, and somehow it doesnt seem all that out of place. The last thing I do on Thursday is head back to the Marvel booth for the Jeph Loeb (comic creator and writer/exec producer for Heroes) signing (that girl is still smiling). While were waiting in line the guy in front of me is wearing a UCLA shirt. Rob Liefeld (comic creator superstar and Image Comics founder) cuts the line and gets Jeph to sign something for his son. He then goes up to the UCLA guy and tells him he went to UCLA and is a huge fan and that he thinks the guys is awesome for wearing UCLA stuff but the guy doesnt know who Rob Liefeld is so hes kind of confused, and after Rob leaves I tell him who he was talking to. Jeph is a cool guy and Im wishing I hadnt forgotten half the stuff I wanted him to sign back at Chris house. I meet back up with Chris and everyone else and we head out. We get back to Chris place and Brian Fred is there along with Kevin Shannon and Tom McGee and theyre playing a playtest game. Kevin is using a TRM/Revo/Racing deck of Brians. I get in for the next game and play Toms Chancellors Office Garrison deck against Kevin and the TRM with Tom sitting behind me and coaching. I dont remember much about the game but I dont draw into space and he gets Tantive to Coruscant and I stupidly put POTF on the JCC which he then takes over and starts draining at while Im still fighting him for the office and I lose by some amount.  After that people are hungry and they decide on Cheescake Factory for dinner. We get there and meet up with Aaron Nelson and Kevins brother Eric who looks just like Kevin.  The Cheescake Factory wait time is about 45 minutes so they decide to go to California Pizza Kitchen instead.  Kevin says that hell drive him and his wife Candice over there while the rest of us walk the 1 block. Somehow it takes Kevin 45 minutes to drive a block. More people come in at this point, I remember Matt Thornton shows up and maybe someone else.  Dinner is a fun chance to get to know people I really hadnt spent much time with before and afterwards we head to Kevins to play poker and Chris picks up Brian Herold from the airport. Clayton Atkin also shows up at some point and I cant remember if he was at dinner or not, but he was certainly at poker. I dont play a lot of poker, usually just 5 dollar games with friends and thats only a few times a year so my philosophy on this game was to play a set amount of money and play till its gone, and have fun, not really expect to win anything. Well, in the first couple hands I lost a big pot on a straight to Erics full house and then a few hands later I had JQ and got a JQ on the flop for 2-pair and went all-in or something and then Clay got clubs on the turn and the river to get a flush. So I got blown out in poker and at this point it was about 1AM (4AM my time) and Id been up for 24 hours straight so I crashed in chair for an hour until people headed back to Chris for the night. I ended up sleeping on Chris floor which was actually pretty comfortable. Brian Herold was also on the floor.<br>
<br>
FRIDAY<br>
<br>
Chris is cool enough to drive us to the con Friday morning despite the fact that hes gonna be doing an airport run and wont be there all day. Somehow I manage to spend a whole day at comic-con on Friday without spending any money.  I hang out on the exhibit floor all morning and catch a glimpse of Leonard Nimoy and Nichelle Nichols.  Nichelle is like 80 but for some reason is still trying to show cleavage, and as cool as it is to see Nichelle Nichols I have to look away at that point. I drop by the Marvel booth and smiling girl is still there. Now, Brian Fred had asked me to get him one of the Stark Industries business cards from her but I completely forgot at that point. Brian Herold and his friend John Anderson and I are trying to get into the 24 panel, and we figure that Id wait in line from 12-1 and hed wait from 1-2.  This works out for me, cause Stan Lee is going to be in the Marvel booth at 1:30 and Ive never seen him and have always wanted to and who knows if Im going to get another chance. Well, I get to the line for the room where the 24 panel is at about 11:30 and its already snaking around and I have no idea at that point how long it is, but the problem is its outside and cut off from everything else and its sort of impossible to save spaces in.  So I call Brian and tell him to get himself up here if he wants to get in. Him and John come up but someone tells him theres no more room left for 24 and they leave. Well, thats false cause for sure they wouldve gotten in since they werent that far behind me and I got in at 1:20 for a 2:15 panel.  I watch the end of the Big Bang Theory panel and then get to move up into the front section for 24. Kiefer Sutherland and Mary Lynn Rasjkub are there along with new castmembers Freddie Prinze Jr., Anil Kapoor, and Katee Sackhoff. All the writers, exec producers, etc. were there too.  They answered questions and showed about 5 minutes of next seasons premiere, which I wont spoil here but people can message me here or PM on the PC site if they want details. After that panel I went back to the Marvel booth and got in line for John Romita Jr. whos my favorite comic book artist.  He drew the first super-hero books I ever read and Ive been a huge fan of his work on Spider-Man, but Ive never seen him before. At the same time Marvel is having their costume contest and I saw an amazingly got Rogue and Emma Frost along with the very first Mockingbird costume Ive ever seen (the girl in it sounded Australian) and now that I have Im hoping I see more. I got Romita to sign books including a letter that I wrote that was printed in one issue about how happy I was that he was coming back to the book. Then its time to go and I find Brian Herold outside taking pictures with a hot girl dressed up as Maris Brood and joke that we should have her sign a Fallen Jedi.  Brian admits that he didnt even know who she was dressed up as, he just wanted a picture with her, which is fair. Im introduced to Brians friend John Anderson who had gotten to the con from the airport and we head over to where Chris picks us up and takes us over to the hotel where the tournament is going down. At the hotel I find Jan Westergard and Phil Aasen and Matt Thornton and I get in on their room. We head downstairs and start the Reflections III sealed event, which is a great time. We all get a JPSD, a WB Premiere pack, and 2 R3 packs. My first of R3 I dont pull a single useful thing, 3 Defensive Shields and a Trample foil. 2nd pack though I get a Colo Claw Fish which is just broken, and a Palace Raider foil. Since this is squirrel format I get to use both skiffs in the JPSD so I now have 2 Palace Raiders and 2 skiffs. Im sitting next to Aaron Nelson and he pulls and Obi in his Premiere pack. Matt Thornton gets a JCC foil so he can start a 3/0 site and Jan has an R3 pack with Lord Maul, Lando Scoundrel, and Premiere Obi. I get a Bubo and a Wort but no starting interrupt so I cant start Colo. I have Bargaining Table and Den of Thieves so I can cancel 2 drains a turn. Someone else gets an SE so he can play Battle Plan which he also got. I play MKOS but dont end of flipping the whole event cause I dont have non-unique aliens that match my unique aliens.<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs. Chris Schoenthal<br>
I got first and play Jabbas Palace which he converts. Then he plays the Entrance Cavern which somehow is an exterior site and gives me drain +1. I drop a skiff and Palace Raider to the JP and move it to the Entrance Cavern with some forfeit fodder. I drop Mosep and another guy to the JP and am now draining for 4 and can react with the skiff if I need to. He tries to get set up at the desert but Bubo takes care of that. FW<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. ?<br>
This was either against Matt Thornton or John Anderson but the truth is I really cant remember and I feel bad about that. This game ended on turn 4 when I had Lando with Axe and Sic Six at a site and he plays Jabba, Wedge, and another alien. He battles me and I play the damage trippler and react with a Palace Raider on a skiff. I exclude his other alien and I have Colo down and draw like 5,5,6 for BD and he draws a location. I win the battle by 19 and he has to lose 57 because of the damage trippler. FW by 20 something.<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs. ?<br>
<br>
I have no idea who I played and no memory of what happened but I lost.<br>
<br>
Phil and Kevin play in the final and decide to open new JPSDs for that and you can read about that in Phils TR but it was an incredibly entertaining game to watch. After that they all go out for food and I head to bed because one of the other things about being Jewish is that I cant really do anything between sundown Friday night and sundown Saturday night. Cant use electricity of any kind and cant write. So I just go to sleep for the night and thats that. Our room is on the 7th floor and I cant take the elevator so I end up having to walk up and down 7 flights of stairs.<br>
<br>
SATURDAY<br/>
<br/>
I get up and head downstairs and find out that the free breakfast has cereal which I can eat, so I grab some cereal and coffee and wait for the event to start. Its supposed to start at 10 but people arent actually ready to start until around 11:30. Im playing Pistones Wookiee build that he has on DeckTech card for card for light (in fact my Decklist that I hand in to Chris is just a copy/paste into word of Pistones DT list). For Dark Im playing Brian Freds Walkers with a few cards changed.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Walkers vs. Aaron Nelsons 3/2 Mains<br/>
<br/>
First turn he gets out Luke, Strong in the Force and his saber to the 3/2 site for an early drain of 3. I start my set up on Hoth and decide to drop only Onyx 2 to space thinking that 3/2 traditionally plays no space and even if he does have a ship or two, Onyx can shoot it down and then I can easily retake the system. He drains for 3 and I Control his drain cause I dont have 3 cards I want to lose from hand and dont want to risk topdecking something I need to blow the generators. I figure I have 3 more Controls and I can use those to cancel Atrocity. He grabs the Control and as it ends up I never draw into another one. Then he drops Corran in Artoo in Red 5 to the system which is maneuver 8 so I need a 6 to shoot it and theres only one 6 in the deck so there goes that idea. I cant even draw destiny with Onyx so he clear me and I have a rough time getting back to space. I blow the generator and he uses 2 Atrocities to reduce it by 6, and then I get limited to 1 You May Start Your Landing damage all game. I had been limiting his drain at the 3/2 to 2 with Decree but then he plays Harvest to play Obi-Wans Journal on Luke from under his SE (An Unusual Amount of Fear, since he was playing grabbers and devices) and the drain is back up to 3. He drops the Battle Plains and Yoda and now hes hitting me for 5 a turn with his drains. I try to take back space but he puts down Tantive and a bunch of guys on it and eventually is able to drain me out since I cant clear him off the system and hes reducing too much of my damage. FL -14.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Wookiees vs. Brian Freds Invasion<br/>
<br/>
I set up my Wookiees on Kashyyyk and we fight on Kashyyyk a lot. Eventually I get some overflow in and get set up in space with Booster, Luke, and Padme, and drain and Padme damage for 2 a turn and retrieve 1 with Luke. I go to Naboo at some point too and make him waste resources over there. Every game I played vs. Invasion this weekend was very interactive and the whole game is just fight after fight so Im having trouble remembering specific details of each. I got Nar Shadda for 6 at one point and that and the overflow put me ahead. FW +13.<br/>
<br/>
After 2 games Kevin Shannon and Brian Fred are both 0-2 so Im thinking that I might have a shot at making top 4 if I can finish 5-3 and keep my diff up.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Walkers vs. Brian Herolds Wookiees<br/>
<br/>
It takes me a while to blow the generators (think I missed 3 times needing a 3) and in the meantime hes doing his damage on Kashyyyk. Finally I flip and go try to kick him out of space with Vader. He has Tantive at Kashyyyk and amazingly I cant get it to go away all game since Fel and Black 2 are sitting at Hoth and I cant find Onyx 2. I kill his passengers on Tantive and he keeps putting down more. He comes with Chewie and some Wookiees to the 3rd marker, I try to Trample Chewie and draw a 1, and he grabs. I dont remember why but I cant get Garrison off for some reason and he wins by 10ish.<br/>
<br/>
At this point Im 1-2, and its pretty clear that these decks arent going to win with big diff and Im probably gonna need to win out if I want any shot of moving on.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Wookiees vs. Clayton Atkins ROPS<br/>
<br/>
I set up on Kashyyyk and then put Chewie and Yoda to the Spaceport Prefects Office and some more Wookiees to the Spaceport Docking Bay and flip him back. He isnt able to kick me off the sites and that lets me set up in space to satisfy Battle Order and get Luke retrieval going. Eventually he has to move his guys over and try to kick me off Raltiir and he cant. FW by teens.<br/>
<br/>
I think B. Fred improves to 2-2 at this point and Kevin drops to 1-3, which is surprising to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Walkers  vs. Matt Thorntons DBO<br/>
<br/>
He kicks my first fleet out of space with two early Y-Wing Squadrons which Im able to come back and knock off but he plays so many (like 8 probably) that I dont have enough ships left to try to hold more than Hoth. I flip and start doing damage and hes doing faster damage and eventually I get off a reduced Garrison cause of his drain -1 text, and then Ive got 6 cards in life force and a walker in hand in my deploy phase and hes got 8 left and next turn hes gonna hit me for 5 and Im gonna hit him for 5 or 6. I deploy the Walker and use my objective to take Ive Lost Artoo from my lost pile and deploy it and play Limited from under my SE to make him lose 4. He hits me for 5, I make him lose his last 3, and I win by 1.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Wookiees vs. John Andersons Hunt Down (V)<br/>
<br/>
He plays a couple of Endor sites where I drain for 2 which is cool cause I know he cant hold those and make a run at Kashyyyk. He plays Galen and some guys to the 2/1 Kashyyyk site and puts Galens Ship in space with someone other than Black Leader piloting. I get out Booster, Mirax, and Spiral with Capital Support and cant crack his immunity but he lands the ship after that and I get the system. I go down with Wookiees to drain for 2 on Endor along with the 2/2 Kashyyyk site and the system. He tries to Elis to Endor but I cancel it with Yoda and I win fairly easily. FW +?<br/>
<br/>
So Im 4-2, and there are a bunch of 4-2s with better diff than I have so Im gonna need to win both of my last 2 games, not just the one with Wookiees.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: Wookiees vs. Brian Herolds Invasion<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the other Invasion game, I overpower some droids and get Padme and Luke going in space. I almost clear him off the Throne Room and he has to devote a lot of resources to holding that site which means he cant go at Kashyyyk as strongly. FW +?<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: Walkers vs. Vikram Balis TRM<br/>
<br/>
This game was kind of weird. I get my whole space fleet to the system and he still kicks me off with Home 1 with Ackbar (V) Lando, Princess Leia (V) and HCF, drawing 5 BD. Then hes draining for 2 at the system but I flip and have Walkers at the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th markers hitting him for 4 a turn and hes only hitting me for 2 a turn at the system and I dont have to pay for Battle Plan cause Im not draining. I think he plays Corran and I Hutt Smooch, and maybe tries again and I Trample or something but he isnt able to get anything on the ground, and he doesnt play any battlegrounds in the deck and I win even though hes draining for 2 at the only battleground on table and Im holding 3 of my 1/0 sites and a blown away site. FW + teens.<br/>
<br/>
So I end up going 6-2 with pretty poor diff.  Tom McGee finishes 7-1 and Aaron Nelson is 2nd at 6-2 with good diff. I wind up in 3rd place.  Kevin Shannon after starting 1-3 won his last 4 games to finish 5-3 with very high diff and makes the cut as the only 5-3 in the final 4.  It kinda sucks thinking that maybe you lowballed into a top 4, but Kevin and I absolutely lowballed into the top 4. I played 1 game against another top 4 player all day and it was the first game of the day. Phil Aasen beat Kevin twice and then had to play top competition like Aaron and Tom all day and lost out at 5-3. Oh, I didnt play him, either. I think Im really starting to come around and appreciate that in an 8 game event SoS is a better tiebreaker than diff (in a 4 game event I still like diff, and not sure how I feel about a 6 game event).<br/>
<br/>
After the tournament finishes its already 10PM and I need to start working on what decks Im going to play for Day 2, cause I never really thought about it, cause I never thought Id be playing on Day 2. Then, Candace announces that everyone is going out to this Italian place so, we all go out, like 16 of us, which is awesome because Ive never traveled to an event where the entire tournament field goes out to dinner together as a big group after the event (and this happened every night of the event). Usually events like Worlds and the MPC have so many people that everyone is sort of clicky and youll have different groups over in their respective corners during the event and people will go off and do their own thing afterwards. Here though it was a great to have everyone together the whole time. We get to the place and tell them we need a table for 16, Kevin and I go to the bathroom and the bathroom is full of pictures of naked little boys, like 8 or 10 year old boys, and they show you absolutely everything, and the pictures are everywhere you look. It was one of the most f***ed up things Ive ever seen in my life.  We get back to the table and theyd only set the table for 15 so I have to squeeze in between Chris and Jan.  Dinners a lot of fun and I just chill and eat salad and Chris shows me what shrimp looks like and how to take it out of the shell and eat it, which was cool, cause honestly I dont think Ive ever seen anyone eat shrimp before.  There were tons of random photos all over the walls of this place including a big photo of some nuns driving bumper cars that Candace pointed out that was just ridiculous and hilarious.  We finish up dinner which included Jan ordering 2 pitchers of beer to split with people.  After we get back to the hotel I pass on the urge to join a random poker game in the lobby and we head to the room and I try to build decks for Sunday.  I decide to stay with the Wookiees for light cause it went 4-0, and I dont have time to build 2 new decks (its already 1:30).  For dark I dont really know what to do.  I have a crazy Hunt Down Dueling deck that Ive been using on Holotable that auto-beats mains.  Aaron was using 3/2 on Day 1 and there was tons of TRM in the meta, so I put him on either 3/2, TRM, or WYS. WYS is an auto-loss for HD Dueling but it should win the other 2 matchups and be able to keep the diff down vs. WYS, and I couldnt think of anything else that gave me a better chance in more matchups.  Problem was, not only didnt I have a lot of the cards for this deck, I didnt even have a list for it, only what I could remember, and no good way to get V-slips. We get back to the room and its me, Jan, Phil, Veez, Vic, and Matt in the room for the night with 2 beds, which means that even doubling up its still 2 people on the floor.  Normally, being as small as I am I would be stuck on the floor, but the combined factors of A) being the only one there playing in Day 2 and needing a good nights sleep and B) room service being lazy and not changing the sheets on the bed got me the same bed spot I had the previous night. I start throwing a list together in my head just to see if this deck is possible.  Jan shows up with a 12-pack of beer and Im kind of disappointed that I have to be working on decks now instead of just having a good time. I get some cards out of the boxes Ive brought with me, but then just start yelling for other cards and people start throwing them at me, which is cool and I actually got everything I needed for the deck from one person or another. Sorry if I drove people nuts with that and made it hard for Phil and Matt to sleep. I get the deck sleeved and get all but 4 V slips too. I try to put it in a deck box and it doesnt fit. I count it and its 70 cards. exhaust, I miscounted. I end up having to cut 10 cards which kind of sucks, but oh well. I finish the deck around 3:30 and get to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
SUNDAY<br/>
<br/>
I wake up the next morning and head downstairs with Matt and Phil for breakfast.  I try to print out the four V slips I need from the computer in the hotel lobby but they wont print. I go to enlist Phils help cause I know he used the printer yesterday. Just as I get back from getting Phil this woman cuts us off and takes the computer. Chris had sent a text message saying that the start time of the event was being delayed half an hour due to a slight baby malfunction so I figure I have time to wait. She ends up being on the computer for over half an hour and finally by the time I print the V slips were about to start.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Wookiees vs. Aaron Nelsons Chancellors Office Mains<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know Aaron and Kevin had been testing the Garrison deck with Tom McGee yesterday and I saw Tom beat down some Wookiees for 50 overflow yesterday so I tried to stack up the 2/1 site fast. He comes down with Emperor, Arica, and her saber to the 2/2 Kashyyyk site. He puts down Dark Recon so I cant use Bargaining Table to cancel his drain there and hes draining for 3 and retrieving 1 a turn while Im draining for 1 and doing 1 direct damage since hes using Astromech Shortage to cancel Yaruas text. I get Booster, Padme, and Spiral to space but he comes down with Vader on ZIMH which is kind of an awesome combo that Id never really seen before. He fortifies ground with Evazan, and someone else and Im still afraid to come at him cause of Garrison beat down, but I know Ill have to soon. I put Yoda and a wookiee on Spiral and draw 2 destiny to try and knock off Vader. I draw a 2, 5, and end up without enough attrition. He had had 3b3-10 on the ship as a passenger and looses him and a couple from hand for the overflow. Eventually I overpower him enough to make him lose Vader on my turn but then he sticks down another one from hand on his turn. He puts Sidious to the office and I move over to the 2/2 and Strangle Palpatine so he cant use DJP. He kicks me out of space soon after and runs away from me on the ground. I chase after him but his drains are wearing me out and I get a FL by 15ish. Turns out he doesnt even play Garrisons in the deck, meaning I shouldve come after him much sooner, and I shouldve Strangled Arica to keep her from swinging and retrieving.<br/>
<br/>
At the game break I see that Kevin is playing WYS against Tom. Kevin gets a TW (+2) in the game. As long as Aaron is playing something with mains and not the WYS deck I can still win by 15 pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: HD Dueling vs. Aarons WYS<br/>
<br/>
Well, so much for that. I get Vader to the 3/2 on turn 2 to drain for 3 and make him lose to Visage, but he cancels Visage on turn 2 with OOC and Projections my drain. He uses I Must Be Allowed to Speak to play the Lars Mouisture Farm and I verify his deck and see that hes running Harvests along with the standard 2x On the Edge. Now, last night, drunk Jan Westergard had convinced me to take Code Clearance out of my deck since I need shield space cause I was playing 3 grabbers. His rationale was, if hes playing WYS, youve already lost, so why bother, which I guess is still kind of sound, and it didnt matter much. He put Chewie in Chewies AT-ST and Karrde to the Moisture Farm and I dropped Darth Maul with his R3 saber and Emperor Palpatine to the Farm, and Aaron moved away. So now I have drains of 4 and 2 set up, except when I try to drain for 4 he plays Lost in the Wilderness to send Maul missing. I find him the next turn with Palpatine but the turn after that he plays it from his lost pile to send him missing again, so I miss out on 2 turns of draining. By the time I get Maul back a 2nd time he has Ultimatum going. I get a 2nd Visage but he plays a 2nd OOC (Id grabbed the first one). I topdecked my 3rd Visage at some point so that was that. Hes draining at Kessel, Tatooine, the Cantina, and DB94. He never plays Luke so nothing I can do there. He Edges once and I grab with one of my other grabbers. Im holding the Farm so he never plays Owen or Beru but I still lose by 16, which honestly isnt that bad for a 4 character Dueling deck vs. WYS.<br/>
<br/>
Tom plays Wookiees vs. Kevins Chancellors office in their 2nd game and Toms Yarua gets beat down by Kevin for the game.  Aaron and Kevin are playing identical decks and dont really feel like playing against each other so Aaron concedes so that we can all play in the swiss, which is just finishing its 2nd game. Everyone takes FL (-10) for the games they didnt play so we all start in game 3 at 0 (-20).<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: HD Dueling vs. Chris Schoenthals 3/2 Mains<br/>
<br/>
This is the matchup I was hoping to get against Aaron.  Chris didnt have decks ready so he is borrowing the deck that Aaron used yesterday. I drop Lord Vader (V) to his 3/2 and he tries to come down with Mace and I Circle him OOP using Vaders text, and steal his saber. Then I reinforce with Maul and his stick so Im now draining for 7 at his 3/2 and doing Visage damage. All he can do is put down Obi to the Battle Plains but I just move over and duel him off, and he scoops. The game takes about 15 minutes and I feel bad for Chris cause there was really nothing he could do. FW (+25)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Wookiees vs. Brian Herolds Invasion<br/>
<br/>
This is the same game we played yesterday in the main event when I won, but this time it worked out a little differently. He flips and we fight on Kashyyyk and I have a chance to knock him off but he has the droid that lets him respond to battle by drawing the top 4 cards of his reserve deck and deploying any droids for free (and Professor doesnt work on droids!). 3 of his top 4 cards are droids and then he draws 6,5 for battle destiny, and clears my Wooks. I cant clear the throne room and hes canceling Yaruas text and keeping me in check on Kashyyyk and I lose by some amount.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: HD Dueling vs. Kevin Shannons TRM Podracing Revo<br/>
<br/>
Kevin had been playing fun games with this deck he got from Brian Fred all weekend and finally decided to use it in a tournament. This was one of the strangest games of SWCCG Ive ever played. My usual start with the deck is Gift, Bad Feeling Have I (V), and Location Location Location (V). For this matchup though I need to start Decree (V) in place of LLL since hes gonna Revo all my stuff. Then he starts Honor and Im forced to start No Escape in place of BFHI in order to do some damage to him. The game starts and he Revos both my sites and for the first 5 or 6 turns were each activating 6, losing to Visage, and hes ahead because Im losing an extra 1 for Decree. Im drawing big destiny for the race and eventually its tied 23-23. I had stuck Mara and her saber down at the throne room to try and drain for 3 while there were no battlegrounds on table but I forgot that Honor reduces it to 1, and paying 3 to drain 1 when Im only activating 6 didnt seem like such a good move, especially when he put out Goo. The last race destiny he draws a 0 for his first one and uses Podrace Prep to play a 5 from hand for his 2nd. Theres like 30 6s in this deck so all I need to win the race is a 6. I draw Deep Hatred which I usually pull 1st turn with BFHI but couldnt cause I didnt start it in this matchup (I actually topdecked BFHI to Decree on turn 1). So he gets to retrieve 6, and then gets 4 more with I Did It. He puts down Lando, Corran, and Padme to the Podrace Arena cause thats now a battleground. I have to play Vader there to try and clear the site since I cant find a Maul and at this point Im losing an additional 2 per turn to I Did It, since I cant afford to live off 6 a turn with no force saved. Vader kills someone and he cracks Vaders immunity. At this point hes way ahead in damage and its clear that hes going to win. I play Vader again and he plays Obi and I duel and he AJRs. I grab but I dont have another Circle so he clears Vader and thats game. FL by 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the game 6 pairings come out and Im playing Steve Jones so we get ready to play but then it turns out theres a re-pairing and whoever I get paired against (I forget who) and the person he was initially paired against had decided to play their last game as a JPSD match, and had already opened their packs when the new pairings came out so they decided to drop to play JPSD against each other and Matt Thornton (who was the other guys opponent) and I get FWs. I end up playing Matt in a fun game, Wookiees vs. CR (V) and all I have in my hand is Yarua and 1 Wookiee. I know he isnt playing Garrisons so I gamble and go down with them to the 2/1 and hope hell be too scared to try and clear me. He comes down with P-59 and Evazan and draws a 5 and clears the site. I get some Wookiees around turn 3 but he just keeps drawing high for destiny and killing them off. Eventually I run out of Wookiees and lose by 10 or so.<br/>
<br/>
The event finishes up and Aaron is playing JPSD against his wife and nobody knows the last time they saw a girl besides Kim Caton playing SWCCG. Chris gives out the prizes which include an entire table of bad rares and just lets people take whatever they want from that which is cool. I got a bunch of EPP Lukes, Obis, and Vaders, and like a third of a set of Cloud City rares and some WB Premiere rares. In real prize support I got to choose from a stack of good rares and picked a Sidious cause I only had 1 previously. I also got an R1 pack that had no rares and the foil was Redemption, which I got about 5 of from the pile of cards on the table. We all go out to dinner at this Mexican place and I get to see what real Mexican food is like, 20 minutes from the border. They dont really make kosher Mexican cause all the food involves mixing meat and cheese. I get a Dos Equis cause Ive never had it and have been meaning to try it ever since those commercials started popping up with the most interesting man in the world. It was pretty good, kind of sweet, but I like sweet. Dinner is some more good hang out time and a lot of fun convos ensue, and Brian Fred sits at the table with two tortillas on his head. After dinner we head to Kevins for more poker and I lose more money to Clay, but I last a bit longer this time and had been up for a while too. Everyone at the table is wearing hats of varying degrees of hilarity throughout the game, which is cool cause I wear a funny hat all the time. Afterwards we head back to Chris and I pass out. Steve Jones has a 6AM flight and isnt planning on sleeping so he lets me have the air mattress that he had been using so I dont have to sleep on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
MONDAY<br/>
<br/>
I get up say bye to Chris and head to the airport. I got my return ticket with miles and ended up getting to fly business class for free. The became huge when my suitcase was overweight, but not only does Air Tran not charge business class passengers the normal $15 bag fee, it also doesnt charge them the $50 overweight bag fee, so I saved $65 bucks that way. Also got a shorter line at security, and bigger, more comfortable seat (I never really thought it would make such a big difference, but it does) and free beer and shots. We land in Milwaukee for the layover and there is an Airbus 380 parked there, which is basically the biggest plane in the world. Its not in commercial service yet but was there for an air show. Its super long and has 2 full decks. I leave Milwaukee and just before landing in Boston we pass through a thunderstorm and lighting explodes right in front of the window at eye level, so that was both cool and scary.<br/>
<br/>
Overall this was an amazing trip, and one of the most fun times Ive ever had traveling to a SW event. All the people that came were all responsible for that and were all awesome guys, but another thank you needs to be given to Chris, Liz, Kevin, Candace, Eric, Aaron, and Victoria for hosting and running this event (and especially Aaron and Victoria for the hotel room). Hope to see all the east coast people at Maryland States on September 12th!<br/>
