Before<br>
<br>
My friends and I have been planning this tourny out for some time now.  So Chris Green and Brandon Bale come by before to get some gaming on and just to hang.  Then for some reason we stop planning cards and start onto Ganulet Ledgends till about 2:00 am screwing me of any chance for a deck change/tune.  Well anyways I wake up and decided to see what to do with my decks.  Then all of a sudden at 10:30 doorbell rings.  Chris is already here to pick me up and were off to get 2 other guys.  Now were off too the tourny.  When we get there walk in and the TDs not there so we ask around and it ends up not starting till 1 instead of 12.  Well off too the games<br>

<br>
LS:  Throne rooom even though its dead no time to make a descent deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1 DS vs Michael somethings Profit Eloms.<br>
<br>
So we start off he starts profit goods with old skool wb Han.  I decided to deploy no aliens.  Draw up my hand..  preety good.  I drop down DLOTs with his saber to Jabbas Palace flipping and pulling a docking bay.  For the first few turns he doesnt do anything just getting hit from visage and my drain for 3 every turn.  I drop serect plans and drop Emperor with Vader.  Then he starts to deploy stuff to free Han 2 Eloms and the Unique Elom guy doesnt free.  Finally he pulls Honor but its a little late.  He then drops Master luke to my Endor docking bay.  I follow with Tempest 1 and Igar to kill off luke and thats preety much game after he sucideds han and the eloms.  FW(+20)<br>
<br>

<br>
Game 2 Ls vs I forgot his name’s ISB sunsdown<br>
<br>
Well I start my Throne Room stuff.  He then calls the TD over to ask if I can deploy the Farm and Swamp with careful planning well im kinda pissed but whatever.  i then start with 2 twix sites a nudj and draw.  he then drops the spaceport site that if scout here force drain +1.  he drops 3 ISbs for free and some other  scrub.  I activate drop Mantillian Savrip and Squadron Assign.  He then Flips his obj and deploys a PotF on that site.  My turn I use squadron assign to get tala 2 and they go to coursant where i sit and drain for 1 the rest of the game.  Now that im activating a good 10-15 force a turn i decide to attack him with Wedge, Tycho, Luke jedi and saber and Leia.  I win that battle and get a drain of 4 off there.  After that he really didnt have much left and i used Melas with Draw <br>
their fire to kill him off. FW(+15)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Dominating Coursant and Not letting him flip obj.<br>

I drop 2 twix again and take the force from court after deploying a nudj.  He deploys Mara and her saber to AC.  My turn.  Han with Blaster and Leia with blaster to the AC.  We kill each other off and i draw up some.  getting Obi with stick  Luke with stick, Tycho, wedge and blout who is in my hand...  After that he deploys cantina and mos eisly to get his activation up.  My turn luke and blout to the ac where they drain for 2 for a while...  i see he has a preety big hand i grimtassh lost to see his mad beats of aliens coming.  i then deploy obi with stick to the ac.  Next Turn he comes down with Bossk with gun and malar.  doesnt battle becuase i barrier bossk.

<br/>
Game 4 DS vs Mark again’s MBO lets blow up the Death Star<br/>
<br/>
He gets Honor Out Second turn while i didnt get vader till about then.  I finally get vader out to back door and flip while hes dropping all kinds of non-battleground sites to yavin.  well i start to get docking bays and rendilli out to settle for honor.  hes setting up and flips his obj with obi at the docking bay and moving all his guys together.  its getting down to a close game with both of us hurting from visage.  I set up emperor and overseeing it personally on endor.  Then i make my move Drop down Mara with her saber against adbar, wedge and Obi with stick.  i battle with first strike getting back a force.  chop obi wan hit and play you are beaten on him.. drop a 5 destiny while he draws a 2.  i move mara to Massassi headquaters to -4 from his attack run since its set up and ready to go.  he moves over and attempts and misses.  Next turn drain him out.<br/>

<br/>
Highs:  Winning i guess<br/>
Lows:  Almost losing alot of force from attack run.<br/>
Game 5 Ls vs Peter Nordstrom’s court of the vile/kyrat dragon bones.<br/>
<br/>
well undefeated and playing Peter.  I deploy my twix stuff and nudjs and deploy leia with blaster to AC.  His turn he takes the 1 force.  My turn i drain him and draw up some cards.  He starts his beatdown by using AC text and pulling Tyam dren Garen (the tuskin raider guy) and Boelo who i barrier, the 4-lom backs it up deploys cantina and dajs phur.  So on my turn i drop down Melas to cantina and battle we just kill each other off.  Then he deploys Bane Malar and Jabba with Kyrat Bones to back it up.  My turn I drop draw their fire Luke, Han and Lock to Cantina battle.  Chop Jabba (5,5)  so he uses Kyrat Bones text to deploy Vader to the Cantina.  Then i shot Malar hit.  he chops han i draw double destiny clearing the site he draws a 3 and i lose lock.  I end up draining him out with battle order and with me activating more force.  FW(+14)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Peter’s Court that i heard good things about<br/>

<br/>
Game 6 DS vs Peter’s Hidden Base kick my @#$% all day.<br/>
<br/>
Well this was the game of the day everything that could go wrong went wrong.  I dont get vader and all i can do since im an idiot and i think hes playing Hardcore Space HB i play Ozzel to Endor D bay.  His turn Leia with blaster and  comes down and battles.  He misses the shot(thank god) and kills me off.  His turn deploys Twass to my back door.  I then have vader and everything to set up in my hand and the force.  i Drop vader with saber to dark forest and emperor and mara to back door to fight Twass Khaa kill him off and stay there.  he moves leia over and i kill her off on my turn.  Heres when it goes bad.  i decided to move emperor to docking bay to satify for honor.  His turn he deploys wedge, gen cal, obi with stick, nein, hobbie against mara<br/>
battle.  chops mara hit.  draws 2 destiny and cancels mine.  i end up losing 14 raw force and losing 1 every turn now that obis on table.  he finally ends it by killing Vader with luke.  FL(-22)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  NOTHING WENT RIGHT.<br/>
Lows:  EVERYTHING WENT BAD<br/>
