<br>
           Hey, this is The Rattlers Tournament Report. It was that time of the month again, Video Connection Tournament Day!!!.I get there with my brother on time and I trade my foil LSJK for a palpy and a lord vader that I needed for my deck.I also traded my foil mara for another lord vader and some random good crap like TT/OOC, Xizor, and thrawn. I don’t really give a crap about foils so I traded them for stuff I could use better .I then give to some brand new players charity by giving them my overstock of mottis, vader w/saber, farm boys, fetts, and star destroyers. I then give them the advise of taking out their  multiple copies of 2 player set versions of veers, vadeer, luke, and chewie.A toatl of 31 peiople show up which could be  a store record or something.SWCCG is growing pretty well in KAssyyk.<br>
       I am coming to this tournament with 2 new decks.My dark deck is HD(of course) with good space and the power of admirals and imp. commands.My light was a powerful battle and drain deck on cloud city with a hidden mains platform.It had no space but I didn’t think it was necasary at the time. My brother is coming in with  a brangus deck with extremely heavy interceptors/sienar and a hidden mains (or something) for Light side.My rating comin in is 1993.<br>
<br>
    First Game<br>
   My light versus Mike Pistones HD ground battling and dueling(rating 1400’s or 1500’s.)<br>
<br>
   Mike is a cool guy and his rating is not the best indicator of his skill. His decks are pretty solid so I would consider him one of the most underrated people in our region. He starts HD with epic duel, mob. points, arrest order, and secret plans suspecting my retrieval correctly.<br>
I start do/wise, insurrection, and staging areas. I cancel his visage first or second turn and I realize he has no more in his deck. I get out my CC db next to his and put mains there with harc seff to block his drain. I then deploy the 2/2 cc location(I forget what its called) and move my guys and their lighjt sabers over for a better drain. The rest of the game was me retrieving with on and off the edge, battling guys with clash and sorry about the mess, losing a duel with jedi luke, and winning a duel with obi. After the obi duel I just battled with frist strike or brought my large forces at him with order to engage out . That and my drains ended it. <br>
Full Win 2(+23)<br>
<br>
Second game <br>
My dark side deck vs. Mateo"MateoX"Yolka’s x-wing swarm EBO.(Rating 1500’s or 1600’s when it is udpdated.)<br>
<br>
  This guy is the man. He is a very good playerand that came off going 5-1 during his last tournament. I don’t know how he is not a 1700 or 1800 player. Read his report for more details on his tournament and this game.<br>
   Anyways, He starts do/wise, YISYW, and,strike planning.I start mobilization points, arrest order, and something special planned(I always start that vs. almost everything).I first secure the D* db with lord and his saber with a  PASOA to guard him form quick attacks. He loses a few to visage and cancels a visage or 2 early on. He si just setting up EBO and I put out Xizor and Mighty Jabba(kick @#$% combo) at north ridge. I then deploy search and destroy. He responds the turn after with an ice storm(bye bye S+D). By now I have another visage set up and he has EBO set up. He deploys 2 Xwings to hoth and 3 to endor. Then he takes off with another Xwing to Hoth . I wnat to kick the Xwings hard but I don’t have enough force to do it properly so I wait, draw some, and prepare to eat a drain of 6 next turn. That drain of 6 makes us about even with force loss except my visages, drains of 2 , and 3 damage worth od S+D has put me ahead.After that loss I deployed my avenger, chiraneau,thrawn, and dengar in ship to hoth.I battled with inmperial command but he played OON and organized attack. This didn’t do much because he drew a 2 and I drew a total of 10 or 12 with dengar. He lost his Xwings and I lost chiraneau.I then just moved back and forth from system blocking his drains and draing. All the while I’m dealing out visage damage until his LSJK an saber came out against my lone lord vader. I know I’ll never get rid of him later with much of my ground forces lost from drains So I let him battle me. Unfortunately he hits vader and I play PASOA to cancel his destiny and immunity. We lose both and then I just drain him out in space.<br>
Full Win 4(+46)<br>
<br>
Game 3 my dark vs ??? hidden base mains.(rating 1500’s I think)<br>
<br>
This game was ver uneventful. I had visdage going, S+D going with the help of his battleground db, and I was controlling carida with chimara, thrawn, and chiraneau.Barriers and PASOA were everwhere. I did get successfully attacked at his CC db and lost one vader and some losers but I just deployed another. Everything came together and it was game over.<br>
<br>
Full Win 6(+79)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My light vs. Brian Ciezinski(SP?) and his mains/ISB outer rim scouts.(rating 1800’s or high 1700’s)<br>
<br>
This was a very fun game. We were both plAYING heavy ground and he was very light in space if he had any. I got the advantage with a good hand and plenty of mains and sabers. We ran around like crazy with him retrieving with the objective and reducing my drains,while my high destiny with weapons flaring and Order to engage took out many of his ORS.I must have weapon levitaTED  vaders and mara’s saber lost 3 times that game. I eventuallu won when I spread out at my battlegrounds and a battle forced by order to engage took a wrong turn for brian when I fallen portalled one of his guys and he had to lose about 10 plus his 2 hit scrubs. Another battle occured like this with Mara and the game was over.<br>
<br>
Full Win 8(+101)<br>
<br/>
Game 5 vs Eric Hunter’s Interceptor/sienar deck.(rating of 1963)<br/>
<br/>
Eric was my main competition this tournament besides Steve Baroni which I didn’t play.He was also undefeated. I thought I had this game with aim high in my deck and a shocking informatin/grimtash. I was wrong he spread out early and so did I. He eventually drained for 9 a turn and I drained for abpout 8 aturn. My retrieval was placed out of play w/ something speciqal planned for them and he kept doing hit and run missions with first strike and tie interceptors at the D* db. The game was over when he played Short range fighters to retrieve 6 and when he put down dreaded imp. starfleet. <br/>
<br/>
Full loss 8(+83)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Eric Hunters Gaybolt.<br/>
<br/>
I was ready for deadbolt  and the game went the way it was planned. I made sure to start SSPFT and to gather my space fleet in hand. I got lord and saber down early at D*db with PASOA for protection. I also got out chimmara and thrawn to hoth early with a barrier in hand.He put out TK422 at D*db which prevented abotu 12 damge at least. I fortified hoth system with chiraneau and denmgar in ship.He then deployed a lando in GS1 to hoth and I barriered. He assed about messing up and knowing I had abarrier so I let him take it back for some reason. He then plays assets and draw their fire(preventing my imp. command and barrier) and 4 ships with matching guys. He draws a 2 and I draw a totsl of 13 with dengar.I lose chiraneau AGAIN for attrition while he loses outrider, dash, and blount. His space is screwed so he runs away. I then follow  his lone Calrissian in GS1 in space while trampleing TK422 after way too long and putting mara w/saber to north rduge and moving her in to the generators. As a last effort he tried to put Luke a the ridge, figgie moved from hoth db, and obi went to D* db. Luke got smacked by IG, 4lom, and janus.Figgie got smacked by Xizor, and obi got PASOA and smacked by spare mains and lord.Visage and drains finished him off.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win 10(+110)<br/>
<br/>
I win the tournament, Yeahh!The top standings are something like this:<br/>
1.Mike Schiemer 10(+110)<br/>
2.Jimmy Schimer 10(+101) (How the hell?)<br/>
3.Eric Hunter 10(+74)<br/>
4.??? I think it was RIch Hinds with 10(+60 something).<br/>
5th and 6th I think were Steve Baroni and Mateo Yolka who went 4-2 with good diff’s.<br/>
