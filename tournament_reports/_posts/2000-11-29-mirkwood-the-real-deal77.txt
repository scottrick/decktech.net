<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Okay, I figure I have 20 minutes left at lunch break, so<br>
here’s my brief take on the 11/28 tournament at Mirkwood.<br>
<br>
I brought two silly decks that I threw together in Duluth<br>
over holiday so that Mike Bergum could finally have a<br>
chance of beating me while he prepared to re-enter the MN<br>
tournament scene as a contender. My decks, though, won 3<br>
out of the 5 games I played with him. So I figure that’s<br>
more than good enough to bring them to Mirkwood for kicks.<br>
<br>
Light Side: All My EPPs and Ewok Catapults (TIGIH)<br>
Dark Side: Vader (in the Hunt Down format)<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Light vs Mike Raveling’s Ties<br>
He started Kuat, and I suspect ties, but he wasn’t playing<br>
some of the more typical cards, so I got confused. Actually<br>
I was already somewhat confused because I was trying to<br>
think if there was any way for my Light Side to be<br>
competitive with a player like Mike. Answer: No. At any<br>
rate, I started without Chirpa’s Hut, Luke, Saber or <br>
Landing Platform. BUT... I remember before any action is<br>
taken! Whew! Nearly got that loss by 50+. He drained in<br>
space. I drained on the ground. I went in space and won 2<br>
battles, but he knocked out Gold Squad 1’s astromech droid,<br>
and I couldn’t chase him around to battle any more. His<br>
retrieval was better than mine, since mine was Hell to Pay<br>
and then Hell to Pay again.<br>
<br/>
Game 2: Vader vs. Garrett Larson’s Fake-out Hidden Base<br/>
He started Insurrection, so I wanted to get Vader to the<br/>
Home One DB and make him immune to Lost in the Wilderness.<br/>
Lost in the Wilderness would have really sucked since Vader<br/>
can’t deploy to search for Vader. And though any search<br/>
party would have had a good success rate with all the 5’s<br/>
and 6’s in my deck, it’s damn tough to build a search party<br/>
when the only character in your deck is missing. That’s<br/>
right 6 Vaders, no other characters. No starships. No<br/>
vehicles. One Counter Assault. But the deck was about Vader.<br/>
So we each lose a couple, and he deploys Luke to the Home<br/>
One DB where I had thrown an early Presence of the Force.<br/>
Fine. No problem. I deploy Vader there, but don’t have<br/>
Obsession in my hand. Nor I Have You Now. Nor did I leave<br/>
enough force to battle because it appears I can no longer<br/>
do math. No problem. So Garrett deploys Leia and battles.<br/>
No problem. He swings and hits Vader. I’m only down by a<br/>
little power. No problem. He plays Skywalkers. Sure, why<br/>
not? This may be a concern. But I should be fine. I have<br/>
in my deck more than 30 cards of destiny 4 or higher. He<br/>
draws a few low and moderate destiny. I draw... 1. 1? Aw,<br/>
hell. I lose Vader and 9 more. No big deal. With Luke out,<br/>
a duel will swing things back my way. So I lose my 9. And<br/>
in that 9... 2 Vaders. Yuck. That’s half my Vaders! Well,<br/>
he drains for a bit while I draw for a Vader. He plays Out<br/>
of Commission. Well, that’s another single card that can<br/>
just wreck my deck. Fine. He misses Vader. The other cards<br/>
are all meaningless. He deploys spies to cancel Visage,<br/>
and I’ve lost Come Here You Big Coward. No problem. I get<br/>
another Vader into my hand and deploy him against Luke now<br/>
that I’ve finally drawn an Obsession. I play it. He Senses<br/>
and succeeds. Well, that sucks. So we battle and I lose <br/>
yet another Vader. He plays Out of Commission again and<br/>
gets Vader. I have no characters that I can deploy anymore,<br/>
so I concede. Good game.<br/>
<br/>
After our very short game, we play again. Well, after <br/>
reading about Shadows (I don’t like it). This time, Vader<br/>
proves his supremecy. Crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Vader vs. Ryan’s Profit<br/>
Ryan’s the new guy who moved to Minneapolis from ND. So,<br/>
having noticed that he began his career in MN paired twice<br/>
against a Mr. Macy, I assure him that most of us play for<br/>
fun. And then prove my point. By playing a deck consisting<br/>
of Vader, 4 sites, 2 sabers and Red Cards. But this time<br/>
a whole bunch of early drains for 4 at Jabba’s Palace take<br/>
their toll. He moves Han, Chewie and some other alien dude<br/>
over to block the drain, and Han dies to Sniper. Vader<br/>
battles the other two and plays Main Course lost. Ryan was<br/>
playing Profit for the first time and didn’t know it very<br/>
well, so he was a bit stunned to learn that he couldn’t<br/>
drain on Tatooine after Han died. He had lost his other<br/>
Han somehow, so he just suicided by deploying Obi to the<br/>
same site. Then he battled Vader with Obi and an Elom. Ok.<br/>
Vader plays I Have You Now to add a destiny, then<br/>
completely ignorning the Elom, steps aside to duel Obi.<br/>
Obi draws a 0 and some other moderate destiny. Vader,<br/>
meanwhile, has Focused his Attack and draws 3 6’s. He then<br/>
proceeds to swing and hit the Elom and draw another pair<br/>
of 6’s for destiny. This is why Vader is cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: All set to play The Wormanator (Chad Steger) since<br/>
we think we should be paired, I get paired with Ryan again.<br/>
My EPPs vs his Raltir.<br/>
<br/>
I thought he might flip and cancel all my drains. But since<br/>
he didn’t deploy an Imp to the Landing Platform (and never<br/>
deployed anyone to Luke’s site), I activated 7 force my<br/>
first turn--after drawing a perfect hand, consisting of 2<br/>
EPP Hans, I Know, the Home One DB and the Echo DB. I deploy<br/>
my sites, deploy the &lt;&gt; DB from my reserve to Raltir, Han<br/>
to the Home One DB, DB transit him over to Raltir, pay one<br/>
to move Luke to the Landing Platform and draw. His second<br/>
turn, he deploys an AT-ST and AT-ST pilot against Han and<br/>
battles. I play I Know, but he Barriers Leia. I grab the<br/>
Barrier. Han covers the damage. My next turn I activate<br/>
14 (5 at Luke’s DB site), deploy EPP Han from my hand to<br/>
Leia and battle. I have 18 power with 8 attrition to his 8<br/>
power. I lose Leia (having just drawn Life Debt), and he<br/>
loses everything at the site an a couple more, plus stacks<br/>
a card. He battles again his next turn, but I play Life<br/>
Debt, so Chewie joins the fray and I end up stacking<br/>
another card on I Feel the Conflict. Meanwhile, I’m<br/>
activating all the force I need to keep my mains at<br/>
Raltir. He deploys a couple of scrubs to the Executor and<br/>
Coruscant DB’s, so I figure he’s going to try to take over<br/>
Raltir shortly, so I move Han and Obi (who’s joined Han)<br/>
over to the Swamp and DB Transit Luke to Raltir. I also<br/>
draw until I get Kessel and the mini-Falcon. I throw those<br/>
down on some succeeding turn and start draining for 3 at<br/>
Kessel to go with the 2 at Luke’s site and the 1 with Obi<br/>
and Han. Meanwhile, I set up a Catapult and ASP droid at<br/>
the Landing Platform and move Luke to the CC:DB in hopes<br/>
of drawing my Off the Edge to retrieve 6. But Ryan deploys<br/>
characters to each of the Raltir sites, including Choke<br/>
Lord and a couple of scrubs against Obi and Han. He<br/>
initiated a battle there and choked Han on his first<br/>
action. I played Clash of Sabers to exclude Vader and<br/>
chopped one of his scrubs. He drew low, and I drew enough<br/>
to win the battle. Obi was lost, but it was merely a matter<br/>
of moving Luke to Vader’s site. I waited one turn, hoping<br/>
for an Off the Edge, but didn’t get it, so I lost a few,<br/>
then DB transited Luke to Vader. On my next turn, I<br/>
activated everything and put the Catapult back. With the<br/>
only card in my deck a 7, I attempted to turn Vader and<br/>
succeeded. After winning the game, I tried to move Vader<br/>
over to battle Tarkin, but that pesky Moff cancelled the<br/>
once-Dark now-Light Lord’s destiny! Ah, Ryan had the last<br/>
laugh. A fun game.<br/>
<br/>
And so... I had no idea what my diffential was, but I got<br/>
a pack of Cloud City for my efforts--my recycling entry<br/>
fee. And all was cool...<br/>
