<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well its been a while since Ive written a TR.  I believe the last one I wrote was Dagobah Regionals.  Since then Ive played in the TN DPC, East Nationals, Ohio States, and the Dragon*Con mini open.  Aside from various locals.  Anyway Ive had a busy schedule of late so I havent had to much time to work on on decks.  At the last event I played I tried TRM for LS.  I went 0-3 with that so I wanted to scrap TRM.  I decided to go with a version of LSC similar to the deck I played at East Nationals.  For Dark I played the same deck I played at the Dragon*Con open.  It was a Tatooine CR(v) start that basically played reactive mains.  The deck was built teched out against HB and mains, I also included a few cards that I thought would help me if I ran up against ellors (v).  We had planned the event to be a worlds qualifier event.  However when we got to the card shop there were only 3 of us plus Henry.  When no one else showed up the four of us decided to just make it a local.  We paired off and got started.<br>
<br>
Game 1 <br>
My LSC vs Jonathan Frodo Murrrys Tat. Clouds<br>
Frodo just posted his DS clouds deck on decktech so be sure to check it out.  His first turn he just set a few things up.  My first turn I dropped Yoda and a stick at the 3/2 Naboo site.  We both set up for a few turns.  About the third turn he tried to Monnok my hand since I love SAC, I was able to keep him from killing my hand.  He finally finds his ground force and puts Tempest 1 and Blizzard scout 1 down at an exterior Tat. Site.  I play Flash of insight on the table and put EPP Obi at the other Naboo site.  I sent down Mace and miss the walker, I draw a six and he draws low, so I lose Mace and he losses the walker.  Mace goes back to my hand with AJR.  I have a seven on top of the reserve so I on the edge Obi to retrieve six.  I retieve the interrupt when flash resolves and start tracking the cards around to do it again.    Unfortunetlly we didnt do much while I tracked my cards around.  When I thought I had the combo set up again I activated 10 and played the on the edge; but I drew a four!!!!!  I mistracked, oh well, I have been getting used to that feeling the last few tournaments.  The game basically became a drain race and he was able to outdrain me.  I tried to set up the Kessel drain in space.  Vader and his custom tie came down and where able to kill my HC&amp;F with attrition.  Frodo pulled out the win by 10.  Proving once again I suck at star wars against him.  I just will not lend him anymore cards now.  Hehe  :)<br>
FL -10<br>
0 (-10)<br>
<br>
Game 2   <br>
My DS vs Damian Lobacks Senate<br>
Damian was worried coming into this match-up.  His senate had been spanked many a time by me, the most notably was when I p*wned him at east nationals.  Anyway I set up with EPP Maul first turn at the moisture farm and he started fortifying his senate.  After a turn he came down with Luke to Mauls site, and with his senate tricks he was able to kill Maul but stay at the site.  Next turn he threw down Leia and Wedge at the neighboring site.  I came down with EPP IGGY and BFBH, I drew a bunch of destinies and after senate tricks he still had some haters at the site.  Basically the game went downhill very fast.  I threw down Lord Vader at the Endor Backdoor, where he sat for the remainder of the game.  Damian basically just kept draining me, but if I came after him he just played his senate tricks and killed my guys off.  The worst was when he drained me for five at a location.  I was handed my second loss for the day by 23.  <br>
0 (-33)<br>
<br>
Game 3 <br>
My LSC vs Henrys DS Senate<br>
I had just played against senate so I got ready to do it all again.  Henrys first turn he flipped his objective, and dropped the endor back door.  I threw didnt have Sai Tor in my reserve deck so I had to draw until I found it.  On my second turn though I threw down Mace and his stick at the back door.  Mace would sit at the back door all game uncontested.  On my third turn I threw down Luke to the 3/2 site, however his saber was not in the reserve.  Unfortunately Maul came down to fight.  He missed the swing that wasnt deflected and I lost Luke but no overflow luckily.  My next turn I threw down Quiggy and his saber, we combated and I drew a total of 11 he drew a 5 so Maul went lost along with four.  The next turn he threw down Emperor, so Quiggy had to dispatch him next.  I went to combat the emperor, I drew 11 again, I told Henry to draw double ones, he drew a zero and a one so the emperor still went lost.  Quiggy held the Naboo sites the rest of the game.  Next He tried to hold the Naboo system.  Baron and Zuckuss where in space, so I threw down Bright Hope with Wedge and Corran piloting with Yoda (hehe) on board as forfeit fodder.  We fought and he was still able to cause lots of attrition against me with senate tricks, so after two truns the Bright Hope was left pilotless so I lucky drew into Kessel so I ran away.  Unfortunately he had Chimera, but was not able to afford a pilot, he battled and I lost Bright Hope.  Then I threepioed into Home One, but I drew low at Kessel and he kept the star destroyer in play.  We went back and forth in space for a turn and he ended up killing Home One with Zuckuss and Fel and some senate tricks.  However in the end I still got the win by 27.<br>
2 (-6)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My DS vs Henrys QMC (non-ellorrs)<br>
My first turn I put p-59 down at the moisture farm and saved a bunch.  He was missing some cards to flip so he just deployed dash and let me go.  My next turn I dropped the emperor on one of his sites and saved a bunch more.  At this point I had a few EPP mains and first strike in my hand, so I was just waiting for some characters to hit the table.  On Henrys next turn he dropped EPP Luke on P-59 to fight.  I played Force Field (lost) to keep my droid from being hit, then drew a blind seven to hit Luke, he drew low, and I drew high so P-59 lived to fight another day.  The next turn Henry dropped a third Cloud City site, and two characters to flip, he drew up until he had no force and left each character alone.  I threw down Dre Combo against the one that could draw destiny, and EPP Mara against the one that couldnt and first strike for icing on the cake.  I battled with Dre, and he tried to rite of passage away, but he had no force saved for first strike.  It was a wash at Dres site.  Mara swung at her target and I placed crossfire out of play for a second BD, however both where low, so he only took around 10 overflow.  Next turn he threw down EPP Luke and screaming Lando against P-59, but before the battle I played elis to run away to the back door which I had deployed earlier.  He hadnt saved enough force so Lando had to be lost and Luke sat alone.  The next turn I dropped BFBH and Janus, I battled he missed Fett and I drew double ones, but he scrubbed on his draw too.  After that it became a drain race.  I ended up getting the win by 32.<br>
4 (26)<br>
<br/>
I ended up placing second on the day.  I gave away copies of V-14 previews that I had printed up.  All in all it was a fun day, but would had been more fun with more players.  Damian placed first as he was undefeated, and Frodo came in third with Henry rounding out the rear.  Hope you enjoy reading this little report, lets just pray the formatting stays.<br/>
<br/>
Good Night<br/>
