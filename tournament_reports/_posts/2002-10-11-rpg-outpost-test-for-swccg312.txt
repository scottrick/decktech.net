<blockquote><font class="bfont"> So, Lately I have been doing well minus my playtesting sessions and have won two of my last three tournaments in the "mighty" Coruscant.  Things have been hectic lately getting prepared for RamapoCon II (http://orion.ramapo.edu/~slingrel) so I have not been able to devote time into new decks.  I end up taking my two decks (Juz's Revenge and Anktopot) to RPG hoping to see TJ, Ray, and Company.  To my dismay, TJ and Ray do not show up but we are able to get a good turnout with Lolli, Joe Young, Praskac, Livio, Hodur and Pete Flamini...the list goes on.  <br>
<br>
I decided to change one card in my deck before the tournament and pull a Master Luke from my light for an Orimaarrko for the direct damage issue.  My dark had no changes for this day.  <br>
<br>
Game 1 my LS Vs Livio D'alessio's (1813, 332 games)- EJP Objective Scum Deck with Rancor treats<br>
<br>
This game started great for him as he had three sites in his opening hand.  He also dropped Jabba to the audience chamber and No Bargain.  I decided that he could have the audience chamber.  My turn to not lose the force due to the objective, I put Leia down to the sarlac pit and moved to Jabba's Palace.  His turn he drops down some scrubs and battles.  I hit one, attrition the other.  I lose Leia.  He also drops Mos Eisley at the far end of Tatooine.  I this decide to drop 8d8 and EPP Obi to the Mos Town and insert.  He activates and loses five.  He then drops resistance, AWU and Mara with Saber.  He battles and misses Obi.  I end up missing as does Mara but the attrition cause Mara and 8d8 to get lost.  I then drop down Artoo with him and an 8d8 again and insert again.  After losing 11 cards and most of the aliens he puts scum out and then tries to retrieve and get back into the game.  The odds kept popping plus getting Tibrin out late game and losing 3 to keep taking pop shots at Jabba with EPP Luke ended the game.<br>
<br>
FW +18<br>
<br>
Highlights- playing Livio is always fun because he builds new and different decks that can destroy you if you are not careful.<br>
Lowlights- not getting any of my locations out early.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2 my DS Vs Ted Panczyszyns (1599, 482 games)- Tatooine Mains and Toys with SAC minus the C.<br>
<br>
Well Ted starts with Obis Hut and Goo Nee Tay and I start my Hunt Down Start with Crush.  This game was very close with him and I constantly taking out Mains with Smoke Screens and high destinies.  It eventually can down to battling which was a good thing.  Not much else I remember about this game though other than I did win.  Damb memory block.<br>
<br>
FW +10<br>
<br>
Highlights- Ted was NOT playing inserts!<br>
Lowlights- What the heck happened?  I wish I could remember.<br>
<br>
Game 3 my LS Vs Chris Lancis (1745, 52 games)- Hunt Down with At-Ats, Tatooine Deserts and Sandwhirls.<br>
<br>
Chris started the hunt down stuff with Crush.  He even mentioned how you need to start Crush against a Yavin IV start like mine ;).  Sounds good to me.  I dropped a nudj and on his turn he slapped Bubo to eat up.  My turn I dropped down EPP luke and killed off the pet.  Drew some and got ready to get my deck plan going.  His turn he dropped two Tatooine:Deserts and Ozzel in Blizzard 2.  My turn drop a nudj, Artoo and 8d8, insert.  He seems confident so I start to wonder if he had torture so I make sure I have force saved up for my grabber.  He activates and it pops.  He loses 12 force and drop resistance.  He pretty much lost all hope in any offensive after that because most of his characters were lost then.  My turn I drop Tibrin with ships and insert again.  He ended up taking two more odds for 12 and 6 before the game ended.  Not much he could do to catch up after the odds popped for so much.<br>
<br>
FW +32<br>
<br>
Highlights- Deck working perfectly, playing against a unique deck.<br>
Lowlights- Bubo eating a nudj<br>
<br>
Game 4 my DS Vs John Lollis (1897, 478 games)- Yavin Force Choke with Random Drain sites and Frozen Assets.<br/>
<br/>
John, knows my deck perfectly so he decides the best way to win is to make me lose to my own Visage and hope that he can win in the long run.  He starts the Yavin start I start normal with Crush.  So we go on for about 20 turns losing to Visage all the while he loses Battlegrounds and Tterminateds from his hand.  During this time I have Reactor Terminal out and I am setting up my hand with what I need.  I get out the D* Docking bay and Drop IG, then Vader to flip the Objective, then DB Transit Vader to the Executor DB.  He finally drops Ben and Wedge at Obis Hut and Obis Saber.  I do not worry about him draining because of the objective being flipped.  He then decides to move the game along and drops Tawss at the Farm and Boshek at the Swamp, kills the nudjes and waits.  I smile.  I drop Mara, Blizzard 2 and First strike down.  Battle retrieve, then Trample BoShek.  I also deploy Dengar w/gun to ECC IGs site and wait. I am still draining from the D* DB with Dengar and IG.  His turn he dropps EPP Luke and EPP Han against Mara.  I am thinking whooping time so I decide to duel EPP Luke.  He freaks out and plays Courage after I play <br/>
Focused attack so we both get 3 destinybut he is adding one to each.  I draw a 5,5,6 to a total of 20 while he draws 4,5,.1 to he gets 18 ;)  he crosses he then runs to  Twass site.  I move the three over let him go.  His turn I clash Tawss and he deploys Daughter and moves Han to Daughters site (swamp).  My turn drain some more, trample Tawss then drain some more.  The game ends pretty much then after being able to drain without much restraint from John.<br/>
<br/>
FW +19<br/>
<br/>
Hightlights- Wining by making him change his strategy.<br/>
Lowlights- Not having a battleground for about 20 turns.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my LS Vs Kim Catons (1801, 340 games)- ISB Sandwhirl Desert Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my DS Vs Kim Catons (1801, 340 games)- MWYHL with Kessel and X-wings, Bothans, Undercovers, and the Holotable Drain.<br/>
