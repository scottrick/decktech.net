<blockquote><font class="bfont"> NJ Open 8/14/04  <br>
<br>
A Tournament to be Reckoned With<br>
<br>
<br>
Two weeks after A Scrubs Tale<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pre-tourney stuff:  I confess, I wasnt originally planning to make it to this tourney.  I was slightly bummed after MV, and I had just found out that Gen Con wasnt going to happen for me.  Also, I found out that it would be over 3 hours for me to make the drive one way.  <br>
<br>
But, then I started chatting with MV 2004 Champ Scott Lingrell, and he said hed give me a ride if I make it to this mall on the other side of Philadelphia.  This seems like a cool plan, and at 5:50 am on Saturday morning, Im up and on my way to the tourney.  After some minor :)  assistance from Scott, I make it and were on our way to NJ.  We talk about anything and everything SWCCG, and he even gave me a slight heads up on vset 8, altho its still too early to know anything for sure.<br>
<br>
We get to the comic place really early, like 9:45 or so I think, and people start slowly trickling in.  It doesnt take very long to realize that were going to get a crazy high turnout, the highest number of SWCCG players in one place Ive ever seen, (altho I admit that doesnt necessarily mean much).  :)   27 is the final count, and everyone loves a perfect cube.  Shortly after Scott starts collecting the paperwork, I realize that, without the tournament even starting, I have made:<br>
<br>
SCRUB MISTAKE #1<br>
<br>
When we switched cars back in PA, I left my wallet in my car, aka Old Yeller, aka the Yellow Tank.  So I feel like a complete idiot, and am again quite thankful for Scott, who agrees to front the money and have me pay him back.  Yay for me.  Lets hope that there arent too many moments like that today.  If I can keep the # of scrub mistakes under the number I made at MV, I should leave here happy.  :)  By the way, did I mention that there were 27 people playing?  Including, 2 guys from Germany!  That was really cool, ich habe Deutsch fuer vier Jahren studiert.  Hope to see those guys again sometime, so I can get a chance to sprech with them, and see how I would do.  Anyway........I guess I should talk about decks for a bit.<br>
<br>
	After MV, I decided that most of the time that I lost was due to stupid playing, not necessarily deck flaws.  So I bring the same decks, but change up a few things.  I run 2x Captive Pursuit for example in the profit now, simply because I dread the CCT matchup.  And the Hypo came out of CCT, when I realized I could stick IT-O (v) anywhere and have him still do his magic.  Oh, and I fit in that crazy little combo that is so fun in CCT.  Fanfare + All Too Easy = money.  So anyway, lets get this thing going....<br>
<br>
Round 1  My profit vs. Adam Weinsteins Invasion<br>
<br>
I ALMOST started Disorder (v) in this matchup, lol.  So he starts Mob combo, Fighters Straight ahead I think, and Arrest order combo?   I think.  I start DDTA, of course, Seeking (v) and Colo.  He puts out the generic docking bay, and does the whole dofine/activate the droids thing.  I put out 3po, and I think at first we do a few dances with Epps and battle droids.  Leias gun is good.  Real good.  I think I used it with Colo to get a ton of overflow on one battle droid early on.  He tries to shuttle Dofine down to the Throne to flip, and I point out that that only works to exterior sites.  So he has to go the docking bay first.  (which was right next door).  I put Luke with stick and Lando Scoundrel in the Throne Room.  He moves over Maul and some battle droids.  I go to move away, but wait!  Halt!  Thats a crazy card, I had never seen it before.  So luke doesnt get to move and I decide to battle anyway, even tho it will hurt.  I take a few overflow, and he flips.  I eventually free Han I think, and start more damage rolling.  To flip him back I send the bright hope (v) and Tantive IV (v) stuff in.  That works well.  The early overflow, and steady drains in space, etc eventually ends the game.<br>
<br/>
FW  (+ maybe 20 or so)  2 (+20ish)<br/>
<br/>
Props  To me for not starting Disorder (v)  :)   And to Adam, it was a fun interactive game.  Leias Gun is good too.<br/>
<br/>
Slops  Halt I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
Round 2 My CCT vs. Jarad Konskers Nonprofit<br/>
<br/>
Ah, this lovely matchup again.  Im not a big fan of this matchup at all, for either side.  Truth be told tho, I do think that CCT has the edge here.  Oh well, its gonna be close, I know that before we even start.<br/>
<br/>
Jarads profit deck is very very similar to the one I was playing that day.  It was kinda funny, Id see him play a card, then think, well, I use that card with card X as a combo, so he probably does too, and stuff like that.  Anyway, here we go.<br/>
<br/>
I do the Lando (v) and Executor set up right away, and he puts out A Gift.  Man, that stinks.  I never get rid of 3PO, and in retrospect, I probably shouldve.  90% of the game is either him putting someone on cloud city, then I beat his character down, or vice versa.  One highlight was coming down and using All Too Easy on Obi with Stick.  Im glad I put in that little combo.  I try to do the IT-O stuff to drain for more where Obi is, but he just keeps laying on the beats.  When he frees Han, I immediately put out Bubo and try to eat him.  I think I ate Princess Leia (v) first, and like 3 turns in I finally ate Han, flipping him back.  My drains are fairly small thanks to A Gift, and he doesnt do a whole lot of damage except for right after he freed Han,  so its coming down to the wire.  He finally poops Seeking at the end for a final rush with Quiggy with stick.  Time is called, and we have the same number of cards in our Life Force.  Thats never happened to me before.  And I have one less card in my Lost.  Hows that for close?<br/>
<br/>
TW  (+16)<br/>
<br/>
3	(+36ish maybe)<br/>
<br/>
Props  To Jarad, for playing an awesome game.  It was extremely interactive, and thats always fun.  <br/>
Slops  For timing and it being so close.  No one likes for a game to be decided like that.  Oh well, thats the way the cookie crumbles.  (I guess that reference is worth 1,500 cool <br/>
points.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, after two rounds Im 2-0.  Compared with mystic visions where I went 0-2....that cheers me up.<br/>
<br/>
On to Round 3.<br/>
<br/>
Round 3 My Profit vs. Kelly Kriebles Walkers<br/>
<br/>
Ooh the joy.  Everyone whos anybody knows how much I LOVE this dark deck.  Anyway, this game gets off to a pretty slow start.  He puts out One Arm to the 5th marker and Zuckuss in virtual MH to Hoth and passes to me.  I do just about nothing, set up A Gift I think.  Then we both kinda just wait for something to happen.  I decide to do something at the system, and that doesnt really work too well.  He puts the Chimaera there, with Chiraneau, Vader and GM Tarkin, and 2 walkers aboard.  So thats a lot of forfeit.  I just battle so that I can clear out my guys at the system, theres no way I can do squat there now.  Imperial Command prevents me from getting more than 1 destiny.  (If memory serves, I had Princess Leia (v) and Lando Scoundrel to add destiny there) I think he forfeits maybe 1 walker.  When hes ready, he moves down 2 walkers, deploys a 3rd, and is ready to blow the generator.  He used Veers (v) I believe.  Not much I can do about that, he has way too much power and forfeit.  So he blows it and it just kinda gets ugly.  I do manage to free Han and retrieve my 10, and it quickly just turns into a damage race.  After I take the two Garrisons, (and start trying to retrieve some back), Im starting to do like 6 damage a turn from obj and drains.  I think his damage was around 4 from drains and YMSYL.  Both of our piles are getting pretty low, but my damage, (and retrieval) is slowly going to pull me ahead in the end.  But, alas, time is called.  At that point in the game, he had more life force than me, so I get the TL.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
Props  Kelly played well, he was smart and kept me from really doing anything to prevent him blowing the generator.  <br/>
Slops  To timing.  No one likes to time, and despite my efforts, this game got off to a slow start and never really picked up too much.  Oh well, life goes on.<br/>
<br/>
TL  (-14 maybe)    3  (+12 I think)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Im still positive at least, does that count?  Im getting hungry now, but because of the last two matches timing, I have to just move on to:<br/>
<br/>
Round 4:  My CCT vs. Timothy Yung?  (or Yuri, sorry, I see it both ways on DT)s Ebox<br/>
<br/>
He starts 1st marker, Maneuvering flaps (v), Strike Planning I think, and something else.  This game gets off to a slow start for Tim, but I get the Despair (v) drain going pretty early on.  He takes awhile to get out EBO because he deploys some character to the echo docking bay, when he meant to put him somewhere else and put out an xwing at the dbay.  IT-O (v) and Despair ensure my drain of 5, plus 2 at Bespin.  Eventually I think I come down to the 4th  marker with P-59 to shoot Luke.  I really should remember more details...I apologize for being brief here.  He throws down 4 x-wings I think to Kessel eventually, and I move the big super star destroyer bus over to block the drain of 5.  We dance back and forth for awhile, but eventually its time to battle, and I start to wittle away the x-wings.  The constant damage of 7 or so a turn just eventually overwhelms him, causing him to lose some key stuff along the way.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+23 maybe)     5  (+35 give or take)<br/>
<br/>
After 4 rounds, finally I have a break to go get some eats.  Theres this nifty keen pizza place nearby, so I run down there and get some slices.  Pizza is good, and theres a direct relationship b/w how hungry you are and how good pizza tastes.  I hadnt had pizza that good in awhile.  By the time I get back, Scott is calling out matchups for<br/>
<br/>
Round 5  My Profit vs. Vinay Bhaskers Walkers<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this is my lucky day.  Actually, no, not at all.  This game actually starts off a bit better.  He deploys Blizzard 4 early, and gets vader out.  I rush with Princess Leia (v), since he put out Presence on the 5th marker, and kill him, shooting blizzard 4 with her gun.  I was feeling pretty good after that.  Then, who should come out, but another blizzard 4.  And because he had out Imperial Domination (v), he retrieved vader after our previous battle.  So vader is out again, but now I have no leia gun there.  I think Tempest 1 was there too by now.  So the power generators go, and I lose a lot again.  Again, I time it so I retrieve 10 from Han afterwards, but he uses IAO/SP so I cant do any surprise shenanigans with Nabrun.  He also uses a ton of stuff at the system so he has insane power and forfeit.  If I try anything, he just keeps retrieving Imperials with Domination (v).  No  way was I going to suspend it.  I guess one kinda dumb mistake was pulling Boss Nass Chambers with Wesa instead of the Battle Plains.  I shouldve gone there to cause damage, but oh well.  <br/>
At one point I rushed with Lando Scoundrel, and he tries to Trample him.  He misses.  I then say I might want to pull the grabber to get the next Trample.  He says hes not going to give me the chance and he plays another Trample, and gets Lando.  I tell him I should have had an action to pull the grabber, but he says that since he already showed me the next Trample, I shouldnt be allowed to pull the grabber.  I didnt feel like it was game-breakingly critical, so I say ok.  I have a bit of trouble with retrieval thanks to Coward, and his damage overwhelms me.<br/>
<br/>
FL  (-20 sounds good)  5  (+15)<br/>
<br/>
Props  If I think of any, Ill let you know.<br/>
Slops  Imperial Occupation (v)<br/>
<br/>
Well, by now I know I wont be making it into any kind of top positions, but I least I can finish better than I did at MV.  The last matchup is called for<br/>
<br/>
Round 6  My CCT vs. Hunter Roleys LS Combat<br/>
<br/>
This match is always very interactive, and usually fun.  He starts Rycar (v), Saitorr (v), and maybe Wokling (v)?  Cant remember the 3rd.  First turn I pull a bit of a scrub mistake, by putting Palpatine on his shuttle at Bespin.  I did it because I activated the Executor Effect and I really wanted to go to space right away.  Next turn I get the Executor out tho, and land Palpy.  Lando (v) is so good.  <br/>
Right off the bat he puts R3 Qui-Gon with his Tatooine saber and Prof on him.  Drain of 4, not bad at all.  I eat it for a turn, electing to pull Despair (v) and work on getting the chain going to start my big drain.  I rush with Maul with stick and Dr. E combo.  Battle, hit Qui-Gon and operate.  He flips.  He then counterrushes with another Qui-Gon.  He does the thing where he loses 2 to get the saber from Lost Pile.  He battles, and swings at Dr. E combo (were at the 3/2 site).  He draws a 1 and a 2.  Thanx Lando!  So he misses, then I swing and he dies again.  Corran Horn and Obi with stick came to the Security Tower to try and spring Han.  I deploy Corporal Derdram to block the drain, and because hes flipped, Obi and derdram are in a stalemate.  LSJK comes to join the party at some point, and I lose 2 to combat I believe.  In the meantime, I do get the drain of 5 rolling with Jabbas Prize.  Yoda, MOTF comes out twice to Naboo.  Bubo goes to Naboo twice as well, and gets him both times.  Lando is so huge!  Bubo eating Yoda is still one of my favorite mental pictures from all of SWCCG.  My damage is rolling pretty well, and although I do lose some to combats and a few drains, its not enough.  I get the FW, but it was pretty close.<br/>
FW (+not a lot)  <br/>
<br/>
Props  To Hunter for playing a good game.  We joked around quite a bit, and that always makes the game more fun.  Interactive games are the best kind.<br/>
Slops  I forgot to mention this during the game.  Hunter played with these super crazy shiny sleeves.  The whole sleeve is sparkly!  I was temporarily blinded whenever I verified his Reserve, and that may have helped him out a bit, not sure...<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 7 (+33).  Obviously some of my numbers were wrong before, but oh well, I was just working from memory.  8th place isnt horrible, and props to Mike Dalton and Greg Shaw definitely for going undefeated.  <br/>
<br/>
After the prize support is handed out (a whole bunch of Premiere packs...there was some kinda mix up with the PC) Scott starts to randomly give some of his stuff away.  I ended up with a Control signed by David Prowse!  Thats really awesome, thanks Scott!  Oh, and now for the title explanation.  I also won a key chain that certifies me as a SWCCG Tournament Player.  Hoo hah.  I am a Force to be reckoned with.  Pretty funny at the least, you can all return back to your chairs after your fits of laughter stop.  Greg Shaw ended up with an uncut sheet of DS II I think.<br/>
<br/>
So people start to filter out, and it looks like its almost time to go.  Do you think this TR is wrapping up now?  If you do, then youre WRONG!!!!  I ask Scott if he wants to play two games before we go, and he agrees.  His decks are pretty much the same ones that helped him Mystic Visions 2 weeks before, going 6-0.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1  My Profit vs. Scott Lingrells crazy dark deck that starts the Cloud city sector<br/>
<br/>
Im not really sure what to expect, but here goes nothing.  First turn he puts out Zuckuss in V Mist Hunter I think to the sector.  I respond by putting out A Gift.  He eventually gets Presence on it, and that lets him drain for 1 for most of the game there.  I put out the Naboo:  Battle Plains and bait with Princess Leia (v) and screaming lando.  He rushes with Vader and Fett I think.  I use Its A Trap.  Now its MY turn, and I put down someone else, battle, shoot with Leia to make Vader immediately lost I think, and when the smoke clears he loses 14 overflow.  We battle a lot on the ground, with the likes of Mauls, 4-LOM with guns, and Dr. E combos.  I just concentrate on killing whoever comes out, because I know hes slowly draining his resources.  When its the opportune moment, I spring Han to retrieve 10.  Eventually he runs out of characters, and the damage from drains and such ends it. <br/>
<br/>
FW (+32 I think)<br/>
<br/>
I then elect to try the other side, hoping to have CCT avenge itself against the same RST that beat it into a pulp at MV.  (See A Scrubs Tale for details  :)  It wasnt pretty)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  CCT vs. Lingrells RST<br/>
<br/>
Well, as we get started, I vow to myself to not let Boba Fett, BH get slaughtered alone somewhere.  :)    I get Lando (v) set up right away, which is good.  I also get everything I need for the Despair (v) drain set up relatively quickly.  I hold characters for when he goes to the bunker.  Bubo eats some people, (Crix Madine, and Luke with Stick) to help prolong him blowing it up.  He does launch attacks on cloud city, to hurt my presence there, and to stop my big drain.  I think he played OOC about 10 times during the game, which was tech.  I probably shouldve grabbed it, but oh well.  Eventually he does blow it however, and I lose 8 and the such.  It gets down to the wire at the end.  By that I mean Scott eventually put Lieutenant Blount at the carbonite chamber in front of corporal derdram to block the big 5 drain.  I have like 2 cards in hand, but one of them is P-59.  He comes down, shoots blount, he loses 2, and I get like 5 overflow I think.  That just about ends it.<br/>
 FW (+5ish)<br/>
<br/>
After the 2nd game, its time to go home.  On the way home, we talk about the tourney and stuff, and all other kinds of junk.  When we get back to my car, I DO remember to pay Scott my entrance fee, thankfully my wallet remained in my car the whole time.  He gives me directions to get back to I-95, but I somehow manage to mess it up.  In my defense, visibility was horrible that night tho, it was raining cats and....some other household pet.  With help from Scott again, I find my way tho, and live to make it home and play SWCCG another day.<br/>
<br/>
Final props  Scott deserves props from me like 10 times or so.  Thanks for taking me up, for bringing me back, for fronting me some $$$, for running the tourney, for giving away all the cool stuff, for staying to play 2 fun games afterwards, and for making sure I didnt get stuck in PA forever.  Cant wait for whatever the next big tourney will be in these parts.<br/>
Props to all 27 people who showed up, keeping SWCCG going strong.<br/>
Props to Shaw and Dalton for going undefeated.<br/>
Props to CCT for going undefeated.<br/>
Props to you for getting this far.<br/>
Props to Bubo for eating Princess Leia, Luke with Stick, Yoda twice, Han, and General Madine.<br/>
Props to the German guys for coming across an ocean to play at the NJ open, and for squeezing in Gen Con afterwards ;).<br/>
Props to the pizza place by Dark Horse Comics.<br/>
<br/>
Final Slops  To me for leaving my wallet in my car.<br/>
Imperial Occupation (v).<br/>
To the rain for making it wet and hard to see at night.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry guys, but I cant think of an appropriate reference for this report.  There was already one earlier on, and the two from the MV report are still up for grabs, I guess I made them too hard.  ;)   Ill TRIPLE the points then, for the two from the mystic visions report....I know that makes it oh so much more tempting doesnt it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I suppose thats it, until next time............<br/>
