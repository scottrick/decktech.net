<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <br>
This years edition of the Tierfon regional was held in Tilburg, the Netherlands in a game shop called "De dobbelsteen" (The dice). To attract more people for<br>
the traditional season opener in Europe, it was decided to hold my country's championship in another country, closer to Germany. It's only 50 minutes driving from my home and especially the German players take profit with a significant reduced travel time.<br>
<br>
A total of ten players showed up, which is more or less the usual amount of players.<br>
<br>
I haven't that much details from the games because I had absolutely no time to take notes (you will see why).<br>
<br>
<br>
MY DECKS<br>
<br>
For DARK I went back to my old skool AOBS. Before the revolution it couldn't handle the jedi infestation but now it got a more than decent chance to stand firm vs. any ground deck. Also, Breached defenses combo and Ni chuba Na are great additions to my favourite deck.<br>
<br>
My LIGHT was also something I took back from the refrigerator. It's a TRM/EBO I played years ago with the emphasis on space, but the new Luke SITF and crazy wizard are huge in this deck.    <br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 1<br>
My dark vs. Dennis Hes' TRM/LTWW with EPP's.<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure what to expect from Dennis' deck so I decided to start with YCHF instead of chuba, which was a big mistake.<br>
Dennis got a lightning start he found the naked droid, some twixes and starts cycling right away. My start wasn't that good but I could set up Xizor/Guri on the coruscant DB by turn two and flip my objective.<br>
After turn 3 Dennis deploys a lot of revolutions, he activates a ton while I am reduced to a crappy force activation of 5. By the time I found my Ni chuba na my Xizors and cards to get him back were all in lost pile so I could never flip my objective.<br>
Halfway things were looking bad but U3PO saves the day and Dennis can't drain me out quickly. I found IG-88 with gun and threaten to capture people, there is still a chance to save the game. I somehow know Dennis deployed all his peeps on table and try to drain big elsewhere but time is called and I fall 4 cards short.<br/>
<br/>
TL -20         <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2<br/>
My light vs. Andreas' IE/IC vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Andreas plays his favourite deck and I know I'll just have to stay away from his vehicles on Tatooine if I want a decent chance to win this game. We both set up our stuff and ignore each other.<br/>
Andreas has trouble finding his 4th site but flips his objective and secures Tatooine.<br/>
I play it safe and strengthen my forces on Hoth system, Endor and North ridge. Tatooine occupation gets<br/>
canceled and the drain race starts. I take the lead with 6 vs. 4.<br/>
Andreas plays it smart with his total beefed-up immune Devastator and Tarkin's orders which I must grab. A few battles occur, I lose some ships with imperial command (can't grab it) but at least I get some drains trough. When I finally found my landing claw and few spacecraft I set up a final surprise but time is called and I fall two cards short. I give Andreas the pleasure to play his limited resources but that didn't matter for the result.<br/>
<br/>
TL -10<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3<br/>
My Dark vs. Roman's WHAP scrubs Podrace.<br/>
<br/>
Right before the tournament I took out Sebulba's podracer from my deck. Ouch!<br/>
Also, WHAP is immune to Vengeance of the dark prince damage. But flipping AOBS is easy now, I only have to keep Xizor far from action to recycle my cards and deal extra attrition.<br/>
My opening hand is not good I lack good characters and Roman sets up lightning fast with a first turn Amidala + handmaidens on the Throne room and Panaka + scrub elsewhere.<br/>
I did start Imperial justice and it really helped me to fight at Naboo otherwise an WHAP objective force loss of 4, battle destiny canceling and podrace loss would kill me instantly.<br/>
By the time I lose the podrace, I stumbled my way trough the Naboo palace and control the board.<br/>
Once again time is called but this time, for once I have more life force.<br/>
<br/>
TW +26<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4<br/>
My Light vs. Roman's SENATE.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know Roman's deck so I play it safe and plan to secure my systems with a lot of ships.<br/>
Once again Roman starts at light speed, flips his objective turn one and all his political effects hit the table. So no early pressure for me, I continue to set up good drains but most of them get canceled by senators on political effects and some controls as well, ouch!<br/>
Menace fades keeps me alive and Roman eventually runs out of canceling possibilities.<br/>
I drain for free, got the dreaded combo Civil disorder (non virtual)/Weapons display (DS) active and when I got Roman's beans in the bag time is called. Oh noes!<br/>
<br/>
TL -8<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5<br/>
My Light vs. Jurgen's Court scum.<br/>
<br/>
In this game I have the Main power generators in my opening hand and by the end of the second turn all my locations are on table. Each turn I lose one force to the court objective.<br/>
Meanwhile, Jurgen sets up the usual alien stuff. By turn 3 the crazy wizard with saber and journal comes to DB94 and objective damage is prevented. I made that move because Jurgen doesn't activate a lot and he had only three cards in hand. Nevertheless he deploys Aurra sing + blaster in front of the crazy wizard and after the battle the site is cleared. I won't visit tatooine again.<br/>
It took me a while to secure all my locations but once I did I was comfortably leading the drain race<br/>
and my Civil disorder/ Weapons display combo is active. Everything runs well until time is called.<br/>
ARGH! NOT AGAIN!!!<br/>
<br/>
TL -18<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6<br/>
My Dark vs. Jurgen's TIGIH Ewoks.<br/>
<br/>
My opening isn't that good but at least I could prevent a lethal ewok assault on Endor early game.<br/>
After a few turns I activate quite a lot and could recycle nice destinies before Luke and a bunch of Ewoks flip me back. I find a way to block Jurgen's big drains and disarm Luke is but it spend much effort and resources to do so. Jurgen keeps spamming the board with Ewoks, for the first time today I have time to eat something I was almost starving. After a while I seize board control and right before Jurgen runs into my beatdown trap the wake-up call rings and he decides not to battle. OMGWTFPWNED!!!<br/>
<br/>
TW +25<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FINAL RESULT<br/>
<br/>
1. Nico 8(+70)<br/>
2. Paul 8(+9)<br/>
3. Dennis 7(+44)<br/>
4. andreas 7(+32)<br/>
5. Floris 7(+19)<br/>
6. Frans 5(-26)<br/>
7. Marvin 3(-19)<br/>
8. Jurgen 3(-34)<br/>
9. Stefaan 2(-5)<br/>
10. Roman 1(-90)<br/>
<br/>
The last round was very tight, Nico and Paul are the only players able to win the tourney, both lose their game and Nico finishes first after the regular six rounds. <br/>
<br/>
The final confrontation is declined, Nico is Belgium champion again, he doesn't remember how many times he won it o0.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally it was a woeful performance, all my games timed out. I am the only player without a full loss.<br/>
Mehhh...<br/>
And two points with only -5 differential that must be a world record *GASP* <br/>
<br/>
Next time better I guess.  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
