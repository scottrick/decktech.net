<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament Pre-week:<br>
<br>
This Tournament is gonna be huge. Jeff Cook is running it in Glen Burnie. I can't wait to go, so almost all week (starting the Friday before) I try to make decks that are balanced enough to win against anything, but able to keep a pretty high differential so I can definitly make the final. <br>
<br>
First decks are DS Senate (I'm kinda ed up in general, so it's kinda hard to gauge, on my page) and LS Combat. I decide that senate will probably lose to light senate if they tech for it, so that's gotta go because I know a few others will be playing Light Senate. Make an untested Combat, starting Blaster Rack, IAO Combo, and Mob Points. <br>
Standard combat, but I pack 2x Stop Motion cause cancelling Dodge and Arconas is cool. <br>
<br>
LS Combat is solid, with racing and a pretty good space package (Wedge, Luke, Falcon, Spiral). Everyone always pulls the Reactor Terminal shield against me, but I'm not sure thats the best way to go. Whatever.<br>
<br>
I play in a swiss 4 game tournament on Saturday the 19th, going 3-1 with wins against a pretty solid MBO, DS Senate, and TIGIH. My LS loses against Imperial Occupation / Imperial Control, which pretty much suprises the crap out of me. Jon grabbed my Sense, which was game ending, cause I couldn't hold a system in space and therefore couldn't save 2 battlegrounds. I tossed Aquaris to an early drain, so I couldn't even touch Hoth. This stressed me out, cause I was sure my deck could take walkers. I tweaked it a bit, but tossed it out in favor of a new TRM deck I built.<br>
<br>
TRM gets tossed, because I realize I can't even play Revolution on Hoth locations against the new objective. I think it would be pretty solid against most decks, but I want to be able to hurt more, and lightsabers can't do anything against Walkers.<br>
<br>
WYS is my new deck, with 4x EPP Luke, 3x Clash of Sabers, and 3x Sorry About the Mess Combo. I can go for the beats with EPP Han and 3x Don't get y, or just keep Luke in the Cantina, and Definitly be able to hold a battleground site. I end up scrapping this deck, because Menace Fades won't work against Walkers, and I don't have space for <br>
Nick of Time to cancel Trample on Han. <br>
<br>
Let me just say, I don't think IO/IC is broken, but it is really strong against alot of decks.<br>
<br>
I pick up the combat deck, decide it's the best all-around deck I have, and add Under Attack, 3x Out of Commission Combo, and Heroic Sacrifice (for Blizzard 4 or PCP Fett).<br>
<br>
Dark side is a little easier. I know the Senate is real solid, but with all the LS Senate decks I know are going to be there, I decide it's a little too risky. The DS Combat did really well in the Swiss, so I step it up with another Force Field, Arica, and 2 control combos for <br>
any SAC I might see.<br>
<br>
Enter Thursday: Scott Lingrell posts that he, Greg Shaw, Bill Kafer, Ray Bordier, and Jonathan Dansbury will be making the trek down to MD for states. This is gonna be awesome. We're looking at about a 20+ turnout for the tournament, and that's huge for MD. 2 years ago states only had about 26, with only MD people there.<br>
<br>
Saturday comes, and I am pretty hyped. I got alot of sleep, and my decklists were already done. Through the driving rain, I finally make it to Games, Comics, and Stuff. I'm the first one there, so I talk it up with Jeff and go over my decks with him. Jeff has seen me scrub out pretty bad in 2 Final Confrontations I've been in (2001 MD States and 2002 Yavin 4 Regional), so he jokes around with me about that and how, with the NJ guys coming down, I shouldn't embarrass myself. Uncool. In total, we end up with 21 people, which rocks. I built decks for my friend Kevin Slattery, who is just sort of getting back into the game. He has the WYS and a Scum with Dark Jedi that starts Crush the Rebellion, so once I flip I can go for giant beats with Vader and Fett or Maul in space. It's fun. But, 5 minutes before the start of the tournament, we realize I left out the Tatooine Docking <br>
bay in the WYS, so we have to change the objective for Rendevouz Point and play it as is. Not cool.<br>
<br>
ON TO THE GAMES!<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS Combat vs. Jonathan Dansbury-Court Mains with Heavy Space<br/>
First turn, he plays Blizzard 4 and Vader (for free) to Great Pit of Carkoon. Well, this satisfies Court, but he can't drain. I put off winning the race until he forces me to lose 6, and then finally deploy to space with Wedge. He drops Guri in Stinger, I barrier, and he ends his turn. My turn, I drop Luke in Ship, and Han, Chewie, Falcon, and <br/>
force a little overflow. I end the game with about 3 cards in lost pile, because he can't really kick me out of space and he can't drain with Vader. FW 2 (+38)<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 2 (+38). I am the top seat.<br/>
Scott Lingrell, Greg Shaw, Jon Westergard, Kyle Hartline, Jesse Hartline, Bill Kafer all win thier games. David Lanking, from Michigan now in DC, also wins. Now that I've looked him up, turns out he's pretty good. 2035 on the ratings board! I don't know exactly who he played, but he ended up 5-1 with a timed win, which is what kept him <br/>
out of the final.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS Combat vs. Kyle Hartline - Hyperdrive Generator deck <br/>
First turn, I drop Maul with Lightsaber. His first turn, he drops Obi Padawan Learner with Lightsaber, Proficiency, and Meditation to the Junkyard. Ouch. My second turn, I drop Piett and Merrejk to the Executor Docking bay, and Arica to the Junkyard, which made this game as unbalanced as it was. He uses to SATM combos, but can't find one. By the time he does, he misses the swing and thats pretty harsh. So, the <br/>
whole game consists of me draining for 4 with Maul, 2 with my 3rd turn Executor and Chiraneau, and 1 at the Holotable. He finally gets Han and kills Arica, but by then I have Vader and Palpatine on Tatooine, and 2 Controls to cancel drains. By the end, I've cleared all his characters. <br/>
This was like a 15 minute game. FW 2 (+28)<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 4 (+66). I am the top seat.<br/>
Scott, Greg, Jon, Jesse, and myself are the remaining 2-0 players. Game 3 Pairings: Me vs. Greg Shaw, Scott Lingrell vs. Jesse Hartline, and Jon vs. someone 1-1.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS Combat vs. Greg Shaw - Broken Senate<br/>
This is a bad matchup for my deck. Senate usually fares pretty well against LS Combat, and with Greg behind it, this is gauranteed to be a tough match. His first turn, He drops a matching Interceptor and Pilot to Naboo, which stays there all game. First turn, I draw really crappy race destiny, but get an Escape Pod, to pull the Hologameboard. Also have a Houjix in hand. I play Qui-Gon and Houjix at the gameboard, and draw the rest. He flips second turn, but without Lott, and pulls a Political Effect. My turn I drain, and he topdecks the subtract 3 political effect, which hurts alot. He pulls the Coward sheild, but not before I drain with Houjix. Vader comes down against Qui-Gon while the race is still going (he hasn't been stacking destinies, but I can't seem to draw anything high), but I barrier. He has the combat shield out, so on my turn I opt for stacking my Artoo in Red 5 for Combat destiny instead of dropping to space to try and take out his ship, who doesn't yet have a cannon. I drop Leia, and OOP Lott Dodd, the turn before he later told me he was going to pull Maul. I Combat, but lose cause I draw a 3 and 7, while he draws 11. Unbelievable. Play Escape Pod to pull Projection Of A Skywalker, but his turn he puts it back in my used pile with Obj. text. I'm tracking that 6 and I have a 7 to stack on Qui-gon, so I Dodge away from the <br/>
battle, and finish the race that turn, retrieving my 6. I played to space, but LUke died twice to attrition, so I can't occupy a battleground for I Did It!. He has Abilityx3 out, but I deploy someone to space or a Jedi every turn, so nothing comes of it. I finally beat Vader in 2 Combats, getting rid of him and 8 force. Sidious was at the Podrace arena, but he's now unable to drain. wedge jumps in Artoo in <br/>
Red 5 and moves to the Death Star, since now I have two battlegrounds for Coward. I lose two to Abilityx3 once, and he hits me with Limited Resources for 4, but it is too little too late. I drain in space and ground, for a win by 8. Tough. FW 2 (+8).<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 6 (+74). I am the top seat.<br/>
Jesse gets a TW against Scott, and Jon wins his game. 3-0 players are myself, Jon, and Jesse, who has a timed win.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS Combat vs. Jon Westergard - LS Senate<br/>
Jon has this awesome Senate deck, he's been talking about breaking it out for States for a few weeks. Well, it's time to see what it's about. First turn, Maul to the 3/2 site. He drops a ton of stuff, getting his second turn generation up to 17! I need a Stunning Leader, but alas, none to be found. I drain for 4, and he plays Vergence of the Force. Well, I Move over, so I can continue to drain for alot. He comes down with Qui-Gon and Lando, Scoundrel, killing Maul but causing little overflow because I Force Field the lightsaber and he draws low. retrive the lightsaber when I flip back. 3rd turn, I drop another Maul, which he lets me drain once with and then he kills. Well, by the time he flip, his lost pile is pretty big. I continue to drain sometimes, while <br/>
he has nothing going except a few battles. After I kill of the last of his characters on Naboo, I drain him at both sites and we have a brief battle in space. He never really did any damage until the end, when he got Mas Amedda out, and moved Boss Nass and Rep Been to a &lt;&gt;Forest. I beat him out of space, then drained him out. FW 2 (+22).<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 8 (+96). I am the top seat.<br/>
I am the only remaining undefeated. If I win the next game, I am in the final. Jesse loses to Greg Shaw.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My LS Combat vs. Bill Kafer - Build the Death Star 2 Ties<br/>
I race really slow again (Argh!), but by the time I win the race and drop I Did It!, I get back most of my lost cards. He iting me for a few drains of 2, but I keep battling him off the system the Death Star is orbiting, so I lost no force to that. He never drops a TIE Cannon, so all space battles are pretty solid. At one point, Han, Chewie, Falcon cause about 7 overflow, which was pretty big. My continuing drains on the ground and Obi battling him away from his <br/>
Battleground docking bay seal it for me. FW 2 (+26).<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 10 (+122). I am the top seat.<br/>
Scott is the top 4-1, so we play. If he wins, he's in. I'm in, cause my differential is so high. If I beat Scott, then the winner of the Dave Lankton vs. Jesse Hartline plays me in the finals.<br/>
<br/>
Meaningless Game #1 (Game 6): My DS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - RTP<br/>
Well, it turns out Scott is running a Rescue the Princess deck hell-bent on killing combat. So, since I'm in the final, I don't do everything I probably could've done. He frees Leia 3rd turn, while I still haven't gotten a jedi on table. I play a guy on the ground, he kills them and they go OOP. Maul, Vader, Merrejk, Piett, and Palpatine all fall this way. I have a destroyer with Chiraneau in space, but I <br/>
have to pay 4 to drain and he drains for free with Leia and for 3 with Luke on Naboo. By the end of the game, I've wittled him down to 13, but this was a pretty uneventful game. There were alot of battles, but nothing surprising or interesting happened. Prophetess did manage to survive almost the entire game, but eventually succumbed to EPP Luke. FL 0 (-13).<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 10 (+109). I am #1 after 6 games of Swiss.<br/>
<br/>
Scott makes it to the final, since he beat me in game 6. David won his last game vs. Jesse and had a higher differential than Scott, but since he had a timed win, Scott was in with 10 (+60) or so.<br/>
<br/>
Prize support is handed out, I get a Foil EPP Maul and a few packs. First place in the final will get an uncut sheet, and the bye into day 2.<br/>
<br/>
I decide to play my LS first, since I have a lot of confidence in it, and it can get the big win.<br/>
<br/>
Meaningless Game #2 (Final game #1): My LS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - CCT.<br/>
Scott's Carbon Chamber deck is based on the premise of stopping me from playing Lando or Han all game. Well, he made a mistake about that, which gave me a oppurtunity to end the game pretty fast (more later). First turn, I forget to race. Idiot. Well, I pull the Hologameboard and have a Houjix and Projection of a Skywalker in my hand. I play Yoda to a site and Houjix to the gameboard, and draw up. The race starts off really slow for me, drawing a 6 and a 0, while he draws a seven (Phantom Menace). I try to use A Step Backward to put back my 0 and his 7, but it's ruled that only my 6 goes back, because he doesn't have a podracer. It makes sense, my fault. He drops Blast Door Controls, but I neglect to pull my Alter with Yoda. He drops 4Lom, Xizor, who I can't barrier, and There is no Try Shield (after I alter Blast Door Controls, but Xizor is already on table). He initiates, kills Yoda, and he still has Xizor. My turn I drain with Houjix, and draw a few. He plays Lando and Ephant Mon to the Security Cell, and moves Xizor over to the 3/2 Naboo site (holding Stunning leader and a barrier). <br/>
<br/>
I have Lando, Scoundrel in hand. Scott says I can't persona replace, because I don't have presence, and Persona Replacement requires presence, because under 'Persona Replacement' it says I must obey the cards deployment restrictions. After much discussion with Jeff Cook (TD), it is decided that presence is not Lando's deployment restriction. So Lando, Scoundrel replaces his Lando, and Wedge Antilles, RSL joins him.<br/>
<br/>
I also play Epp Obi-wan against Xizor, because he still may have a Houjix in hand. He barriers, but I sense and lose 2. I battle with Obi, hitting and sending Xizor to used, ending the battle. I battle Ephant Mon with Wedge and Lando, he plays Stunning Leader, which I sense, and lose 2. He loses Ephant Mon and 7, cause I drew bad destiny. I move Lando and Wedge over, to satisfy Coward, and pay upkeep for Lando. I win the race, and he drops Vader to try and kick me off my second battleground. I Barrier, so he can't, and he doesn't have Reactor Terminal shield or Secret Plans shield so I retrieve 6 and he loses 6. He is down alot now, and I only have a 5 card lost pile. I use I Did It! to get back 4 more, and battle away Vader with Corran and a Dodge to kill his weapon destinies. He flips with a second 4-Lom, but it is too little too late. P-59 comes down to kill Wedge and Corran (after he Set for Stuns Lando) but I Barrier. I drain a few times for a win by 37.<br/>
<br/>
37 in the first game of a final confrontation is big. His LS beat me, but by 38 a second time? I don't think so. I'd have to be S.O.L. (hehe Scott) to let that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Meaningless Game #3 (Final game #2): My LS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - RTP.<br/>
I get a first turn Maul, who drains all game. The turn he would pop Leia with R2 I Set for Stun him, and when his Never Tell Me The Odds pops I have Palpatine on table so we tie. He tries to kill Maul a few times, but never hits with the lightsabers and takes overflow most of the time. After about the third turn, when I SfS R2, we both know it's over. He tries to knock out my Jedi, but eventually I just wear him away with Palpatine, Maul, and Ghhhk at the holotable. He never flips.<br/>
I win by 30.<br/>
<br/>
So, I win the MD state Championship. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
I WILL be at Mystic Visions. See you there.<br/>
