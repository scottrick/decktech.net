<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournamen from Modesto Sunday 3/10<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
Well where do I begin this one.  Its been a long time since I played Wars let alone even touched my cards.  I decided since Spring break is finally here I could use this time to catch back up and get back into the mix.  I hear from Clayton "dadohman" that theres a tourny coming up this Sunday and hes gotten a Paul Feldman and Peter Nordstrom coming down.  So what better a way to start back up then against them.  I decide to get started on decks.  Ive been playing Ls combat for both sides since R3 came out (remember havent touched cards) and I thought it was time to change the DS since it was kinda cheezy.  I try to think up some kinda decks to play but nothing really seems to work that well.  After talking to Clayton he convinced me to stick with my DS deck.  With some changes I was ready to go.  I have nobody in the area to playtest with  so I just shoved them in a box and hoped for the best.  Car ride wasnt so eventful i listened to Bloodhound gang the way down there and just about everybody was there.  We start off a little early waiting for Shawn Ely and Paul Feldman.  10 people were there to square off for Claytons Imperial Class Star Destroyer foil but there coulda been more....  Off to the games <br>
<br>
Decks<br>
LS: Light-Saber Combat High Destiny blah blah want to see it aim me<br>
DS: Light-Saber Combat Racing High Destiny Beatdown <br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Don Olivers Mauls Hut/Audince Chambr<br>
<br>
This game was a long slow game.  He starts of by using the AC text and putting Mara and her saber into the AC for some speed drains.  I grab threepio with were you looking for me and activate my 7 force.  I tunnel for Jedi Council Chamber and drop threepio there even though I rarely use him throughout the game.  He drains in the AC and reinforces with Beolo and draws the rest.  I get Qui-Gon with his Saber (due to new SaltorKalfus) and draw the rest.  He still draining and its getting some of my evasion cards (nuts).  He drops the Lars farm with Blizzard 4 there and grabs choke vader and moves him outside.  I drain and play Boussh to the AC to block that annoying drain and Tk-422 to the other site.  He cant drain so he drops vaders saber on Choke vader and Dr E + P-59 to his deployed Mos Eisley.  I drain and get Yoda to the other site and grab a sense out of my deck.  I got him preety locked up where he can only drain for 1 force at Mos Eisly.  I drain and drop Luke to Lars Farm and move him to Mauls Hut.  I have a Barrier, Dodge and a Houjix in my hand incase things go bad.  Well it could have.  Maul comes down against him which I barrier but he cant do anything about.  Vader then moves over.  I decide to take out Blizzard 4.  I bring down Obi with Stick and Draw a 4 which kills it off.  Obi dies but i Relisense him back to my hand.  Luke Moves away.  He snipers Boussh out of the AC so hes got a Drain for 3.  Hes low on force so I hit a Edge for 6 and Luke moves to Mos Eisly and Re-Deployed Obi goes to Mauls Hut.  He nails Luke but I houjix out of a lot of battle damge and dodge obi into the AC and drain him out next turn.  FW(+20)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Back to Action and Still got it........<br>
Lows:  Killing one of his mauls on the first drain<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Andrew Andorfs Pile of Shimi + City Outskirts<br>
<br>
This was brutal.  My DS deck is a beast I either lose bad or win big.  I get a descent hand with my racing and box out on table.  I start the race and draw low like i always do for some reason.  I get maul and his double(added 1 more double night before ^_^) for fast drains.  He gets Shimi to her site but no Threepio.  He draws.  I drain and Race more and set up my hand with some beats.  He gets Threepio to the hut and uses his text throughout the game.  I race but i still havent won yet.  I drain for 4 and Drop Vader and his Stick to the other site for more drains.  He deploys Mirax for more tracking, Lando with Vibro and Corran i think to the City Outskirts.  <br>
I win the race on my turn and get some big drains going.  He loses the 11 and I draw up to 12 cards.  He drains for 1 and Deploys Obi vs Vader.  We kill each other off but mauls still alive.  I decide to attack his guys.  I drop down Mighty Jabba, 4-Lom and Xizor against his guys.  I battle and blank Landos Text.  He draws a site where i draw 3 destiny = to 14 total so he loses all his guys.  Hes really low on force now and doesnt have much else to do.  He plays Jedi Luke with a Saber vs Maul but doesnt have enough to battle or draw destiny so i stack a combat card on Maul.  I drain him for 2 at Outskirts and Stack a combat card.  Duel and Kill Luke with 4 off the top for the game.  FW(+27)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Maul the Machine<br>
Lows:  He didnt have defensive shields<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs Paul Feldmans HB Repulbic Ships Automatic Pilot<br/>
<br/>
This was the best game ever..... for me.  I start off with the race and the box drawing a descent destiny where he plays the Shield for the Race and Aim High.  Battle Plan Shild comes later.  I get Maul to the Naboo Site even with blaster rack from my hand i cant give him a saber and a early game verifiction for Feldman.  Obi comes down and Clears him out with a lucky system+intruder missle(crap i just drew his stick that turn).  He gets some systems out and puts Bravo Fighter and Rend point and draws.  I race and get Vader with no stick thanks to blaster rack again to Naboo Site.  Obi and Corran come back against Choke Vader..... I choke out Corran and he misses the hack but draws a 5 for destiny killing Vader.  He knows I dont have ships so he starts to spread but hasnt fliped yet.  I win the race this turn and Maul and Double comes down for drains.  He occupys 3 so Wattos Box is suspended and only has to lose 3.  But 1 of those 3 was his Hidden Base.  So he cant flip now and preety much screwed himself.  So I catch a lucky break we deserve 1 every sooner or later.  I drain and drain and search and destroy for a few turns.  He pays to drain for 3 and uses automatic pilot(like search and destroy for space) to ding me for some.  Qui-Gon comes down with tracked 7s to occupy for Battle Plan and Search and Destroy.  I duel Qui-Gon for a 4 force loss but he stays alive.  The game ends with a Me Dueling Qui-Out.  FW(+20)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Feldman 2nd time ever<br/>
Lows:  Him Losing his Hidden Base<br/>
<br/>
Well after i beat him we have the famous Feldman Rematch.  Obi attacked Maul.  Phantom Meanace was out so he missed the hack I nailed Obi and play I have you now and Maul strikes for a 10 force loss.  But he beat me down in the 2nd Rematch Somehow. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
LS vs Peter Nordstroms Dark Deal OBj<br/>
<br/>
This is a bad matchup for me.  I made 1 too many mistakes against Peter to have deserved this game.  He gets his 2 sites and plays them along with Bespin coming from reserve deck.  I get a Slow start with only Luke in my hand.  I then make the mistake of drawing over 13.  But i get the Jedi Council Chamber out.  He used monnok thanks to Crush.  He spends a turn drawing after playing Cloud City.  I drop Luke to Carbonite Chamber Early and that was a mistake.  Battle order Shield comes out and U-3PO follows Luke around.  Most of the game.  I draw and finally get Qui-Gon and Obi for some character base.  He sets up Dark Deal this turn by playing a Docking Bay and a Free Executor to Bespin with Sarkli on it.  Zuckuss is Sitting at Cloud City and im playing to drain for 2.  I bring down Obi vs Brangus but stunning leader ends that battle.  hes draining for 5 and Emperor comes down with Janus for 10 force thanks to Goo Nee Tay.  Heres where I make mistakes.  I drop Tk-422 and Boussh to Cover up 2 of his drains but leave Emperor alone cause he cant draint here right........ but i forget that for 3 turns and Emperor hits me for 9 force all together that I should have back.  Other than that he gets Occupation going and I die to drains.  FL(-7)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Peter<br/>
Lows:  Me being stupid<br/>
<br/>
Well even though Im a fricking Dumb and dont deserve the Imperial Class Star Desteroyer I still get it cause i had big diff in a 4 game tournament.  All and all it was fun and most of us stuck around for some pick up games and trading where I got my Qui-with Saber finally I needed 1 of these for centuries now it seems.  I play my Combat vs Shawn Ely but he gives up after a few turns... he forgot to drain in the senate and lots of stupid stuff (hey its all gravy).  I watch him play Feldman a game where Shawns DS Senate gets "fisted" (new word other than rape) by Feldmans Hidden Base.  Then is when the fun happens.  They make a bet for cards.  Whoever wins get a certian deal.  If Feldman wins he gets Shawns Maul with Lightsaber for a Tat Maul Foil but if Shawn wins he gets all kinds of good stuff that i dont remember but I had to leave so I didnt get to see it.
