dpc canadia 11/09/2003<br>
10 participants, 4 games<br>
<br>
<br>
my decks: throne room and walkers<br>
<br>
<br>
8 AM: wake up after insomnia rendered me sleepless most of the night. shower, hit up the golden arches for a mcgriddle, and start driving north<br>
1 PM: arrive within city limits of toronto. mapquest approximated driving time: 5 hours. RSmith One transit time: 4.5 hours. Police sightings: zero<br>
1-2 PM: sit in crappy toronto traffic (where are all these people GOING on sunday afternoon?)<br>
just before 2: park RSmith One, set out on foot to find toronto metro hall. find the hall (only a couple blocks away from the CN tower). there's signs all over saying "DPC Toronto Room 308." I find room 308 and walk in and there's like 20 girls and a guy standing in a circle. one of the girls greets me, "Hello." "hello," i reply. "I must be in the wrong room." "What room were you looking for?" "Room 308" "this is room 308" "oh." turn around and walk out. see some gamer-looking people and follow them to room 3-0-something else where the dpc has been moved to.<br>
<br>
So i'm all set to see the spoilers for vset 6 but as i said i barely got a glimpse of em. i introduce myself to a couple dudes who had copies and ask if i can have a look-see. then i absorb as much info as my feeble mind can for 10 or 15 minutes until the TD calls for registration. no command cards, decklists, and no personal info other than first and last name required as this tournament is not sanctioned.<br>
<br>
<br>
here we go...<br>
<br>
Game 1 my goofwalkers vs. phil who plays a bunch of virtual cards without the virtual text on them's light senate<br>
<br>
     I count this dude's deck and he has 60 cards.<br>
<br>
     He starts SquadAss, Security Control and one other i dont remember. I start the same as always: Combat Response, IAO/SP, and uh that effect that makes my opponent lose force.<br>
<br>
     My opening hand shows me a lot of space so first turn DS-61-2 hits the system in Black 2 and i save a force for the grabber. Phil goes and Squassins for white-bordered Luke in R2iR5. I lose 3 in battle damage to keep DS alive. I come back with Dengar V in POV and add X to attrition which kills him and both my guys stay cuz he drew a 2 for BD. He comes right back at me with ANH Wedge in ship and ANOTHER (this time jap foil without virtual text) Luke from hand, too bad he's playing the wrong Wedge. Again he draws a 2 and i think i drew a 1 or something but nobody dies, i just lose more force. Then I come back with Fel in Saber 1 to wipe out Wedge and his ship. I also had gotten out Blizzard 4 with Lord Vader by this time. Phil sees that he has lost the battle for the system so he goes to set up at the Senate, and puts down Clorox Ryder with a Hovercam and....nobody else?? GAH the only character in my hand is Veers so i cant go beat up Clorox.<br>
<br/>
     I drop Zuckuss in VMist Hunter and own the system. Shortly thereafter I blow up the MPGs and deploy a bunch of walkers and drain him for a zillion. He flips like 10th turn but it's way too late to do anything. I also got Bad Feeling out like 2nd turn and he wasnt generating much force until 5th or 6th when he put down the Clorox/Hovercam business. FW by 22<br/>
<br/>
Recap: well other than the Wedge debacle it wasnt that he was at a loss for cards, i verified his deck a couple times and saw plenty of Palpatines and Might of the Republics and other junk. Anyway he gave me a run for my system early and i got lucky with having a bunch of space stuff in my opening hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my throne room vs. Andrew's SYCFA flip<br/>
<br/>
     He starts the CPI helper and some junk, i start colo fish, dtfire, and insurrection combo<br/>
<br/>
     I count this dude's deck and he has 61 cards. He takes out a card.<br/>
<br/>
     I had a really crappy opening hand this game and it didnt get any better from my first-turn activation. He started pulling sites from deck and he used the twice per game text on the CPI helper to get a CPI in hand and then I Recoiled. But still got a pretty lame draw. i WAS able to set up the JCC with Yoda there pretty early then i bounced him on over to the Coruscant DBay where he would drain for 1 a turn for the rest of the game.<br/>
<br/>
     Dude put out a Gunner and I killed it with Corran Horn. He comes back with Tat Maul and we clear off. He has Ozzel Ozbourne at the Death Star Conference Room which I guess adds 1 to his total for CPI? I gleefully point out to him that my starting location subtracts one from his total. I get Obi with Saber to his Death Star DBay for another drain and then finally put the HCF up at Rendili to satisfy Battle Order. I killed Ozzel with someone and then another Gunner but then I got spread out to drain and got beat down somewhere and had to Houjix? So I moved Corran over to DBay 327 with Obi so I wouldnt get jacked up again cuz I couldnt find my On The Edge to use as backup Houjix.<br/>
<br/>
     That allowed dude to get another gunner out which added 2 to the total, plus 2 more for DStar sites where I had no presence, minus 1 for the Throne Room = base 3, he needs greater than 8 to do it and he draws a destiny 6. Perfect. And I know it was either blind or cheating cuz I had just shuffled his deck. So this allows him to get away with draining me for 4 at Kiffex twice in a row because even though I occupy 3 battleground i had so intelligently decided to remove Ultimatum from my shield selection for the day. Well stick a d.ck in my ear I get the Spiral out with Lando on it to the Death Star for more drainage and it gets beat up by a couple star destroyers and im way too lazy to track so i draw a 2 and a 1 and he pulls like two 7's or something weird and i have to lose both lando and spiral and then i finally get my tracking act together and on the edge someone for some force back and i had been draining at coruscant docking bay with yoda and docking bay 327 with obi and corran and in space with the hcf so eventually i win by 22<br/>
<br/>
Recap: CORRAN HOOOOOOORN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my goofwalkers vs brandon with very noticable canadian accent's lightsaber combat racing<br/>
<br/>
     I dont care enough to count decks anymore.<br/>
<br/>
     He either neglects to or declines to start an effect with his starting interrupt, and i dont remind him. My opening hand this game was SAC, HUGE FCKING SSSSSAAAACCCC but not much else so even tho Lord Vader cant drain i use some of my first-turn TEN force for Blizzard 4 with LV on it to establish my SAC dominance. Also I got a ship to the system first turn, dont remember who but Brando never challenged me in space all game (surprise, surprise). He drew an Escape Pod and a Qui-Gon for race destiny and tried to cheetorr by only stacking the Pod but I said "nice try" and he said "okey i'll stack em both then." <br/>
     He got the first-turn EPP Obi to the 3/2 site, yawwwn i can feel myself falling asleep at this point. I blew up the MPGs on turn 3 and caused him 9 force loss, then started deploying walkers all over the place on Hoth to rack up the direct damage. He got Yoda out to the other site pretty early after he drew a HUGE hand (wish i was playing Monnok) so he was getting a drain of 2 and 2 EVERY damn TURN.<br/>
     He only saved 5 the turn he won the race so i opted to lose the 6 instead of him retrieving 6 and then i dropped Tempest 1 with Ozzel to the Podrace Arena to Trample his 3P0 and also to drain for an extra point. Garrison went off twice, he tried to Sense it the first time but I altered. Then this one turn late in the game he was trying to get some forces back, he did some tracking and said "I'm going to On The Edge Obi-Wan for 6" and i'm like "I Sense." So he paid to drain me instead and then he said "I'm going to deploy Flash of Insight..." and i'm like "I Alter." So he did me plenty of damage but I kept him from EVER retrieving ANYthing and drained him out for the win by 9.<br/>
<br/>
RECAP: zzzzzzzz.......<br/>
<br/>
so everyone else has self-destructed and i am the only undefeated at this point. since we are only playing 4 games with no playoff, all i have to do is win the next game (by whatever margin) to win the tournament<br/>
Game 4<br/>
my throne room vs Seth the american's .... dark deal<br/>
<br/>
well when he shows me his objective i know it's all over. he bores me at the start of the game by pretending that he doesnt know what my starting location says cuz it's in japanese. so he goes to get the tournament director (like that guy has a fcking clue) and while he does that i turn to phil who is sitting next to me and i say "PHIL. do you have an english version of THIS card?" and hold up the throne room and he says "uhhh...yeah!" and digs through his shoebox and gets me one and seth comes back and im like "Here ya go hombre" and he reads it and acts as if he has just read some enlightening piece of religious text or something. ZZZZZ could we please get this game on with?<br/>
<br/>
     I dont have an opening hand Recoil so I cant fck with his Im Sorry business. my first action is of course to pull DDTA shield so that he cannot use his once-per-game Mofo Points just yet. My opening hand was lame but i activated a Speak and 3P0 in my first-turn three force so i draw for those two and they are the top two of my force pile so i am able to save 1 for grabber. He goes and gets sites out, plus he drew both the sector AND the system in opening hand and he deploys them all along with the docking bay from deck.<br/>
<br/>
     I Escape Pod for a Houjix for some reason tho i should have just held the Pod at the time and I drop Phylo to his docking bay, then EPP Luke to the Orgasm Walkway and Yoda to the JCC which came out of deck via the aforementioned Speak. Then bounced Yoda over to the Coruscant Dbay as usual. Then I make another premature ejaculation move by blowing Yoda's once-per-game text to get my Control combo when really I probly should have grabbed the Alter to cancel the free Executor effect. I also got Goo Nee Tay out prrrretty early.<br/>
<br/>
     He got Palpy out to the Carbo Chamber for 7, but I'm content to leave him there all damn game cuz I've been on the good side of a used-Force Lighting/All Too Easy combo and I dont particularly care to see what the bad side is like. Then he puts some OS-4235246-42-whatever on Obsidian424 to the system and uses Mofo Points to grab the Ex and throws down the free Executor effect (here's where i should have altered) and puts the Ex with the TIE.<br/>
<br/>
     I get my drains of 3 with Phylo, 2 with Luke, 1 with Yoda and stock my hand, pretty much waiting for him to make the move since i am out-damaging him. He starts to come down on Luke and makes some comment about how "you're just going to Houjix anyway" but he ends up not even causing any overflow. He puts down Kir Kanos (pfft) with a Force Pike (double pfft) along with 4-LOM with blanker (bah) and targets Luke with the Force Pike and somehow hits which makes Luke power = 0?? and of course his text was canceled by 4LOM. So I put my Resilience (which I was holding to get Luke back with) on the Fish and he draws a BD of 5, making his power 12. I draw a 5 also (Lando) and so I dont need to switch it to prevent overflow OR to take out both his guys in attrition. Soooo he basically spent all his turn and 3 cards out of his life force to take out my....Luke ... Who would re-appear at the same site later on in the game to drain for more. <br/>
<br/>
     I guess what bugged me most about this game was that Seth REFUSED to save force at the end of his turns. And with me starting Draw Their Fire... One turn he left an OS-69-69 in Obsidian-123456789 ship at the sector. All alone. With NO force saved. And I dropped the HCF on it and creamed it for like 13 force. Another turn he left somebody on the ground somewhere alone, producing similar results. He even took battle damage in one of his own battles, when he pitted his ZiMH against my Falcon (still at the sector) and drew a 1 for battle destiny (he opted to lose 4 to keep ZiMH alive). Between all that battle damage and my force drainage, this one was over quick. FW by 23<br/>
<br/>
RECAP: yes, i DID see an all too easy in his deck too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WRAP-UP<br/>
So i win 100 dollars in monopoly money from the 51st state of Canadia. That converts to...barely enough real money to cover my travel costs for the day. But I made it home by 1 in the morning which gave me time to do a load of laundry and catch up on the day's NFL happenings. <br/>
