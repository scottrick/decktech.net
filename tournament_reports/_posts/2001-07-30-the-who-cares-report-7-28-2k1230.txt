<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Decipher Swiss tournament held by Starbase One in Pittsburgh. Director Drew Ferguson (his first ;-). 14 participants. 4 games.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not much of a pre-tourney for this one, I had never been to this place before but I found it ok and parked in the Jewish parking lot... underneath the Jewish Community Center that is. Then I go to Starbase and pay 3 bucks fee and theyre like "the tourney’s in the library across the street" so I go over there and find the meeting room and there’s like 8 kids sitting around talking about how there’s no director and the tourney’s not going to be sanctioned and Drew’s not there and Im like oh great. But then Drew shows up with little slips of pink paper for command cards and its all good.<br>
<br>
Decks<br>
Dark: BHBM that i used two weeks ago, a version is on my page, its got 4 janus to get him out early and 6/2 SAC along with some hate cards like Retwin for RST and Sec Precs and the Cantina and Overload and just good stuff. And twix sites too.<br>
Starts IAO, Crush, and YCHF.<br>
Light: WYS with 3-effect start, but Anakin’s is in there with Neck and Neck x2 and one A Step Backwards so hopefully I can win a race. And with Aim High out Neck and Neck can win games especially coming from lost so its not really a wasted card slot. And I have 2 RLR! and 2 Resilience and 2 EPP Lukes so Luke can potentially be deployed 6 times in a game. Yay.<br>
Starts Insight Serves You, Squassin, and a random third effect.<br>
<br>
Here we go...<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Dark side vs. guy that traded me a Maul AI for a BB Vader’s Profit<br>
He starts UhOh, Insurrection, and DOWISE, son of a beeyitch.<br>
I start with Mara in the Chamber guarding his Jedi Pack Han and I should have switched YCHF for Secret Plans in the starting but didnt think of it.<br>
<br>
So Janus is in my opening hand and I’m thinkin "yeahh, Palpy and Janus to Tat:JP first turn" but then he’s like Palpy is +2 cuz of Uh-Oh and I’m like sheeeeyit. So I pull MJ’s Saber and move her out to drain.<br>
<br>
He putzes around and I drain. And I think I had a twix site and deployed it.<br>
<br>
He puts Daughter of Skywalker down with Anakin’s and Proficiency and doesn’t battle Mara. So I monnok him and see a Fallen Portal, well @#$% that I put Maul down with Mara, initiate, Sense his Fallen Portal, he forgets about Do/Wise, I Weapon Lev Anakin’s stick (bye bye Proficiency), I play I Have You Now and hit Leia with Mara’s stick, draw two BD and one was a site =( but I still crush him and he loses Leia plus about 13 and one to IR. Smiles.<br>
<br>
He putzes around some more and draws some cards and regroups.<br>
<br>
I know he has Ben in hand with some stuff (from the monnok) but I dont really care. I put Palpy out at the Palace finally and Janus down with him so that’s a decent drain of four, guarded by two Jedi and the emperor’s hand.<br/>
<br/>
He puts Ben in the Chamber with a Saber and an Elom, frees han and flips and no Secret Plans so retrieval is free. I put U3PO in there to block the drain but that’s not good enough cuz he still deals me one a turn with Profit, I drop DVDLOTS with a stick and Iggy too, capture Han to used, swing and hit Ben, I Have You Now to win the battle, clear the AC, and flip his objective back permanently.<br/>
<br/>
FW by upper 20s<br/>
<br/>
Cheers: Beatdown on Leia, Sensing Fallen Portal, and i would gladly have lost the 2 force to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers: Emperor deploy +2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
WYS crap against guy playing in his second tourney starting Endor system with Operational As Planned.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second Pittsburgh tourney i have gone to in a row where I have played against someone who starts Endor by itself with Operational As Planned. I soooo wish I had Strike Planning in my deck. But it doesnt really fit in a WYS deck, yknow<br/>
<br/>
He starts Combat Response as his one effect, Desperate Counter was in his deck and after the game I told him he should pull that at the start for sure. First turn he ganks the DS2 system and tries to put Mianda and Hebsly there but I remind him Squassin is once a turn. So he puts one of them there, great for him.<br/>
<br/>
I put some guys in the Cantina and some guys at Tatooine and flip pretty early.<br/>
<br/>
He keeps dropping guys to the DS2 system and Im thinking no big deal. Then he gets Jerjerrod to the DS2 Throne Room and pulls some sectors. By the time he gets them all down and pulls TTO I have drained him for quite a bit and have spread to Kessel for a drain of 3 a turn there as well. Plus I have crazy stuff in hand to fight in space.<br/>
<br/>
He saves up for a turn and plops down the Ex at the DS2 and moves the DS2 to Kessel and the Ex to Kessel too. But he only has two scrub pilots (Godhert and 61-3) piloting and no IAO so I figure no big deal. I only had Mirax there at first so I take a turn to move some guys around and it’s Dash, Wedge in RS1 w/Cannon, and Theron in Red 10 against the Ex (Mirax flew to Tatooine).<br/>
<br/>
He deals me 2 damage with TTO and then battles, I Power Pivot the Ex and he is stunned. He loses everything and I drain him out. No big deal.<br/>
FW 30s<br/>
<br/>
Cheers: forgot to mention, I had Mirax and naked 3po out simultaneously that game, that’s great.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers: Strike Planning!!!!!!! I neeeeeed it<br/>
<br/>
I go feed the meter in the Jewish lot and wonder if i need to on a Saturday or not. But Drew said I had to so...<br/>
<br/>
speaking of, I get paired against him third game. I’m hoping I get to be light side but no, of course not, i’m dark.<br/>
<br/>
My BHBM jank<br/>
vs. Drew Ferguson (1830s) Brian Hunter HB flip.<br/>
Well we played this game for fun two weeks ago and it really sucks for me. I added S&amp;D to the deck so I’m hoping that will help. But he knows Im playing heavy SAC and starts Do/Wise.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Palpatine hits the Endor Bay first turn, and I think i had a twix site first turn too (Maul’s Hut).<br/>
<br/>
He pulls Endor (Strike Planning in his start of course) and put some guys cheap at the RPoint.<br/>
<br/>
I drop Janus down and start using him, looking for the Cantina so I can get S&amp;D set up.<br/>
<br/>
He continues pulling systems and dropping ships, eventually moving out to Endor and Kashyyyk. Meanwhile I am having horrible luck finding the Cantina and/or guys to put there.<br/>
<br/>
After four or five turns of activating and searching, I draw up to about 20 cards in hand and I have: Lord Vader; DVDLOTS; Vader’s Saber; Mara Jade; Darth Maul; Cantina; Search and Destroy; Bossk in Hounds Tooth; and a bunch of SAC, Secret Plans (which i soon deployed), Imbalance (which I played the first time he On Edged and tracked but was unable to Janus for due to life force constraints), and Overload (which I would later use on an XWing Cannon so my Zuckuss could safely hide behing a probe card with Sec Precs out).<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Sec Precs, I lose YCHF to grab it, drop it on Maul’s Hut, put Maul there for free, put the Cantina down, put MJ there, pull her saber, put Lord Vader down on Endor with a saber, drop S&amp;D, move Maul to the Cantina (neato, Maul at the Cantina for 1 force) and I now have two drains of 3 set up along with S&amp;D. I also Force Lightninged TK422 and then No Escaped the FL back to hand to take out Boussh. So he’s out of Undercovers and Im thinking ive got a shot.<br/>
<br/>
He ganks EPP Luke out to take care of my objective. Then he drops his last system and flips. Great, all I have to do is find the base. I see he’s saving force for ICBW on the Sec Precs but I will Sense that even with Do/Wise out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Zuckuss comes down against Wedge in ship (without a Cannon thanks to Overload) and Tycho in ship at Kessel and probes, not the base. Zuck would sit there for a while blocking the drain.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile some other guys are draining me at Kiffex and Kashyyyk (and cancelling my drains with flipped HB), well Bossk drops to Endor (where Drew has no ships) and gets the Barrier. Probe and that’s not it. At this point I realize Fett in Slave is the bottom card of my force pile and I really need to be saving force for a Barrier because I want to keep Bossk alive (or Zuckuss at Kessel) but i know he’s low on guys because everyone seems to be on table already. So I draw Fett.<br/>
<br/>
He’s still getting me for 3 or so a turn in drains and of course there’s that nagging BHBM objective. Plus he’s stopping up my drains, one turn I had a total drain of 8 ready to go (3 at Endor Bay, 3 at Cantina, 2 at Tatooine). he It’s A Hit! the one down on Endor and HB-cancelled the other two.<br/>
<br/>
I put Fett down at Tibrin and probed, not it, moved Bossk on a subsequent turn to Tatooine and probed, not it. He got EPP Obi down to the &lt;&gt;Forest on Tibrin and that screwed over S&amp;D. Then he On The Edged some crap back and I couldnt drain with his objective and everything ... he got Order to Engage out to deal with Zuckuss at Kessel ... basically I probed all but two systems and by the time I put ships in front of those two he drained me out.<br/>
FL 20s<br/>
<br/>
Cheers: No Escaping my FLightning, Maul at the Cantina for one force<br/>
<br/>
Jeers: dark side for being horrible<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well sheesh there’s still 3 undefeateds and Im not even one of them, what kinda @#$% is that?<br/>
Game 4<br/>
WYS against Justin Corellian’s sucky BHBM<br/>
Blah. This guy is one of the undefeateds, and Drew is playing the other. So I tell Drew’s opponent to beat Drew by a lot, and I’ll beat my opponent by a lot, and maybe I’ll win the tourney after all.<br/>
He starts like IAO and some worthless crap, started Mob Points which meant my third effect was Dont Do That Dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
He pulls the Reflections 2 Emperor first turn and I know the game’s over already. I make fun of him and he puts Emperor’s Power at the Throne Room and pulls DS2 dockbay too.<br/>
<br/>
I get a crap draw and I hope he doesnt take over the Cantina too soon cuz Im not quite ready to go there but he does, DVDLOTS second turn. Well screw that then Ill flip in space. I give him Luke from deck for 3 and pull Kessel and get ships at both systems. He drains with Vader and I drain in space. Plus I had drawn a Tunnel Vision so I played that twice. And I draw into my Lost In the Wilderness so I want to lure Vader outside if possible. I put Battle Plan so I can initiate somewhere for free, I forget exactly what happened but I didnt lose so I didnt stack. Bottom line is, Battle Plan is out, Vader’s holding down the Cantina, Im holding down a couple of systems.<br/>
<br/>
Then I guess he planned on dueling Luke cuz he moved Vader to DBay 94. Hahaaa next turn he drained and BOOYA Lost In The Wilderness, Vader goes missing.<br/>
<br/>
He saves up some force and drops the Executor on I think Mirax by herself but I have It Can Wait so it goes back and he essentially loses a turn. Meanwhile Im draining away in space.<br/>
<br/>
He puts Mara down with Saber at DBay 94 and drops the Ex for free, It Can Still Wait from lost pile hahaaa. I drain and regroup in space to prepare for the Ex.<br/>
<br/>
He searches for Vader, no dice, then he DRAINS ME?? Im like hahaaa Lost in Wilderness from lost smart guy, Mara goes bye-bye. The Ex comes down and we fight and I win the battle by like 8 but my attrition doesnt break the Ex’s immunity, plus he had Thrawn piloting and Emperor’s Power and Imperial Command so he drew 4 BD and I lost a bunch of guys to attrition.<br/>
<br/>
I put some more guys down and beat him by like 4 power but again dont break the attrition immunity and I cant find my damn Power Pivot. Well eventually I give up Kessel and fly all my guys to Tatooine, put some schmucks in the Cantina to keep me flipped and drain, run around from the Ex the rest of the game and finish him off with Cantina drains and his own objective. He never won a battle all game.<br/>
FW 20s<br/>
<br/>
Cheers: LOST IN THE WILDERNESS, It Can Wait<br/>
<br/>
Jeers: him draining with Mara, not being able to take out the Ex (at least I wrecked with some battle damage), Reflections 2 Emperor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well that guy that was supposed to beat Drew didnt, so Drew is the only undefeated and wins the damn tourney. My diff is big enough to put me over Justin my last opponent and give me second. Ehh. Drew has no support as this is his first tourney but I get a "free" pack from Starbase and pull Million Voices Crying Out, YES.<br/>
<br/>
Drew and I play opposite sides in a "fun" game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
(this game doesnt count)<br/>
My WYS<br/>
against Drew’s Hunt Down/Racing<br/>
he starts Watto’s Box, my third effect is Aim High. I put Ani’s Racer out against Sebulba.<br/>
My opening hand has A Step Backwards, Run Luke Run x2, EPP Luke, and Jedis Resilience. Hahahahaaaaaaa<br/>
<br/>
He uses Sebulba’s text first turn and draws a Visage for race destiny. Hmmmmmmmm STEP BACKWARDS to put it in used. He MMoves for the Holotable (that might have happened second turn, cant remember).<br/>
I show Wedge to get his ship, well @#$% his ship isnt there but the @#$%ing PULSAR SKATE is so I have to take that. That goes to Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
He puts EPP Vader and Tarkin in the Cantina, pfft. And a Ghhhhhhhhhk at the Table to drain me away. Meanwhile the race is pretty close and I am searching for a Neck and Neck.<br/>
I get some scrub smugglers out to DBay 94 for the flip, that should cut his force gen significantly.<br/>
<br/>
He gets the Cantina drain and moves out to the DBay. The race is still anyone’s as he is playing Collisions and No Escaping them back, etc. I pull off a Neck and Neck somewhere in there and I have the Step Backwards from lost which I use to help me get the totals right for N&amp;N.<br/>
I put Luke down and we battle, there’s some weapons firing and some destiny cancelling and in the end his guys all die and I lose Luke and a smuggler. I dont Resilience cuz I have an extra Luke in hand and I want to keep all the dueling protection I can.<br/>
<br/>
The race draws to a close and he runs out of Collisions. I still have a N&amp;N sitting in lost should I need it. He clears out the docking bay somehow and gets MJ with saber in the Cantina hoping to drain for three.<br/>
I win the race and get free 11 retrieval as Secret Plans was one of his race destinies =) He loses 11 and all hope of winning the game.<br/>
I drop EPP Han and Melas in the Cantina, Luke at DBay 94 and initiate, Run Luke Run, hit Mara, draw 3 BD, win the game by a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers: My opening hand<br/>
<br/>
Jeers: wish the pairings in the tourney would have gone this way<br/>
<br/>
so Im gonna lose some points, but I couldnt think of a more worthy cause, Drew is better than 1830<br/>
