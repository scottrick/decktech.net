<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well, I wasnt even sure that I was going to this event since I had a ton of homework and lots to study for.  So after lots of deciding, influential IM’s from Mike ’Deck’ and others, I decided that SW has priority over homework.  Its just the way it is.  And so, to make this a unique tourney report, here is a clipping of the law work I DID do...<br>
<br>
"...I agree with the statement that the FMLA should cover business with 25 or more employees in order to provide as many people with such job security as possible.  Even though the notion is that employers of about 15 employees are of a family business, many fast food/restaurants (non-chains) would need to be protected by the FMLA...."<br>
<br>
Ok, enough of that.  Originally Doug Faust and I were gonna team up as "Team ITHACA" and bus down.  But the lack of $$$ in my pocket led to Ford 1 (driven by my dad and chris) swinging by my college to grab us and speed down to the city.  Lack of room at my grandparents house cut us short of dragging Mike D’amboise along.. (next time dude!!).  So upon arrival, they drop off my snowboard and we check out my new place... its HOT, we have a kitchen, personal bathroom, i love my pad!  So,  we jet into the car and then speed down to Rockland county.  On the way down I was building my decks, while chris and doug were exchanging tips and my dad was breifing us on Jedi Knights.. (not a bad game btw...).  From the decks we wonder off to talking about my woman troubles and how I like this girl Beth, but Im not sure if I can kick it into overdrive and make something serious out of it all.  After that I popped in my DJ tapes from college (you can hear me thursdays from 4-7pm est at www.ithaca.edu/radio/vic).  My dad critiqued my talksets and then we returned to the decks.  I went from playing WYS to my Dag test 3, then to test 6, back to Obi Hut-Moisture farm mains.  Well, during that mess we had good tunes, and I share with you (a new feature I’ll be adding to my TR’s.. "whoo-hoo!") the sound track to our trip.  Because we all know there is a soundtrack.  <br>
<br>
Linkin Park - One Step Closer<br>
Dream - He loves me, he loves you not (hey. its catchy...)<br>
Goldfinger - Superman<br>
Mest - Drawingboard<br>
Green Day - Basket Case<br>
Blink 182 - Dammit<br>
Lenny Kravitz - Fly Away<br>
Police - Message in a Bottle<br>
Lit - Over my Head<br>
Tupac/Phil Collins - Rear View/In the air tonight<br>
<br>
<br>
So we arrive to my grandparents house and they leave us some snacks, which was really cool.  So the playtesting starts at around 2 am... well to be honest this part is a blur, but the last thing i remember it was 6:45am, and I finally put my decks together and then I jumped into bed.<br>
<br>
7:30 alarm goes off!! (DAAAAAMMMNNN im tired..) and we get up shower, eat and hit the road.  On the way there we are talking strategy and the normal stuff and also all getting mentally prepared.  When we arrive we find half of team albany already awaiting us, and the other half showed up a few nano seconds behind us.  We got lucky and landed a sweet parking spot right in front of Neutral Ground so that was kool.  Im greeted by Greg "Ghetto Leader" Hoder (btw had a green squad a wing in his mouth....?? ;-) and Chris "Jedi Taboo" Prascak.  TJ and other philly folk weren’t around and that was kinda sad but, I continued the hello’s with the Kasyyyker’s!  Steve Baroni, Mike "Deck (im the coolest mutha fuker int he world!" Gemme and the koolest 25 yr old ever, Kashyyk Scrub.. (dont know ur name, how sad am I!!!)  So I finalize my decks and things were quite prompt, so we got right to it.  Right as they were pairing people were commenting on last year’s NYC Reflections event went, and i was PROMPTLY reminded how I went an awesome 3-3.  Nothing like jinxing me right before the tourney eh?<br>

Light: Twigg’s y4 Mains<br>
Dark: Little twigg’s Hunt Down Deck of Doom!!!<br>
<br>
Game 1 Light vs Chris Talbot’s (1612) Hunt Down Duel<br>
<br>
He comes down mad early with Guys to the D*, and by his signature grin, i KNOW he has all secions on alert in his hand, so i set up at kessel.  We scrimmage around on the ground.  He tecked me twhen he you are beatened my Luke, and then wooped on Orimmarko and Twas.  But luckily I had my destiny’s tracked and retrieved 15 force the next turn.  Visage Hit us all game and I couldn’t find my trans but i was retrieving.  He wanted to duel me but he was unsure of his destinies, and made the right choice, i was tracking and he was like, "f*** this, no way am I dueling.  So we fight more on the ground, luke tango’s with mara and ozzel and I retrieved a bit more. FW +36<br>
<br>
2 (+36)<br>
<br>
Good: I have confidence...<br/>
Bad: Playing Talbot.  I love this kid and to come down here to play him is dumb.<br/>
Ugly: nothing, we had fun...<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Dark vs Chris Terwilliger’s (2139) Y4 Mains<br/>
<br/>
I was in the bathroom during the parings and all of a sudden I heard a big... OOOOOOHHHH!!!!  And ya I knew exatcly what that meant.  I stormed out of the bathroom sat in front of Chris, we sighed, (btw this REALLLY BLOWS when it happens!!!) and we played the game.  These games suck for 1 major reason.  We know each other’s decks card-for-card.  I mean CARD-FOR-CARD, not to mention we can anticipate each others every move, so spontinaiety is HUGE.  So His turn he drops 2 2/0’s and 2 db’s and cancels visage w/ blount.  My turn I drop coward and exe db w/ Ozzel on it and I pull Caridia.  He then drops Lando w/ Boo ya axe and battles, I loose a card and then moves lando over with blount and epp han at the holo chamber.  I drop sites and save anticipating him moving over.  He does.  My turn Lord vader w/ stik, and dr e join the show.  Han is beaten, I chop and operate on Lando Leaving blount to take the hurt.  So I evacuate the executor and then set up in space.  Chinerau and the Avenger hit space for a drain.  I knew he was waiting for me to spend my space so he could go kessel, so i put down a pilot to support the avenger.  After a big battle at the Tat DB he lost 5 more force and well it wasnt his fault.  He never saw luke or obi and his destinies were really bad.  But in the end I locked things up and it was over.  FW +26<br/>
<br/>
4 (+62)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Beating one of the best players to ever play this game<br/>
Bad: Playing my brother<br/>
Ugly: The nauseasus feeling I get in my stomach when I play him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Dark vs Steve Baroni’s (19??) How did we get into this Mess Mains<br/>
<br/>
This is a good kid and I felt bad b/c he got a ballz draw.  My turn I drop exe db, caridia, and a 2/2 to the db.  Hiss turn he draws.  My turn Mara and vibrator hit the Home One war room and I draw.  His trun r2 comes out and no interrupt, he still activates like 5-6 to my 13-15.  Lord Vader, Rarkin In a walker and search and destoy hit the table next.  I’m hitting him for tons of damage and his 2/0’s and mains are flying off the top of his reserve.  Jedi Luke comes down but he goes away easily.  Another jedi Luke and EPP Han come doen, but they go away once more.  My drains and search and destroy Finally nod him off.  FW +26<br/>
<br/>
6 (+88)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Playing a good deck and beating it.<br/>
Bad: The look on his face after his ballz hand<br/>
Ugly: The nasty @#$% sandwhich he bought, smelled nasty!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Light vs Scott Lingrell’s (1859) Hunt Down Mess<br/>
<br/>
Top[ 2 undefeateds (4 total) and our diff was crazy so the winner of this would most likely get the top knotch.  I get an @#$% hand.  So I recoil in fear.  Get sites.  Recoil again.  More sites and I cancel Visage.  We are each playing safe.  Then Mara and stick came down to RAPE my lone blount at DB.  He MISSES the swing, and draws a 1.  WOOO HOOO.  My turn honor of the jedi kicks in and mara aint worth CRAP!  So we set up, I deploy mains at tat db for a drain.  I then pack kessel with ships and Im holding a barrier.  So mara and dr e take over CC db and then 2 walkers with guys hit the CC downtown plaza.  Well I knew I needed to strike now, b/c I knew my destinies, and retrieval was going great, but now was a prime time.  Luke and Harc Serf hit the db, I battle hit mara, blaster prof. her away! and then leave dr e to take a hurt with a destiny 6.  I went from losing 8 in drains to now losing 2 and hitting scott for 6.  A little retrieval and more draining finished him off.  A great game and mentally I though I was in trouble but holding the blaster prof was KEY!!!!  FW +27<br/>
<br/>
8 (+115)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Beating scott, he owes me ever since I tossed my deck in the air at Origins 00’<br/>
Bad: Blount almost getting @#$% raped my mara<br/>
Ugly: Poor Dr. E......<br/>
<br/>
Well, I broke the spell and took the gold.  Dark Ultra Rare Refl 1 foil sheet, BAM BABY!!! Chris Erwin tunred some heads getting 2nd, Steve 3rd and Chris Twigg 4th.<br/>
