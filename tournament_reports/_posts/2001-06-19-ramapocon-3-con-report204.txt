This event was huge when you compare it to the last 2 years and it was a<br/>
huge sucess because of everyone there.  Hayes Hunter said it best when<br/>
discussing why Bastain really came to RamapoCon... To see everyone and<br/>
have a good time.  This is what RamapoCon has become, great competition in<br/>
the games, and a great time with your friends you havent seen for a while.<br/>
<br/>
As for my playing in the Open, I decided a long time ago that this was the<br/>
one event that I wanted to play in so I could see if I still had what it<br/>
took to be a good player...I would like to think that I played well to<br/>
earn a spot across from Hayes Hunter in the final.  Hayes was an absolute<br/>
pleasure to play against.  It was also a chance to get to know him, and I<br/>
am very proud to say I lost to Hayes in the final.  He playedlike a champ<br/>
all day and in the final duel.  Granted my light side won again :).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great games Hayes, I will remember our Duel for a lifetime!<br/>
<br/>
I will get into more detail in another report about my decks and the<br/>
weekend in another report later but I wanted to let everyone know that was<br/>
there I will try my best to do another RamapoCon. I know I cannot do it<br/>
alone but with the help I had, everything is possible....<br/>
<br/>
One interesting fact is that I still have a large amount of YJ Open foils,<br/>
ST Open foils, and JK Open promo cards if anyone wanys them :).<br/>
