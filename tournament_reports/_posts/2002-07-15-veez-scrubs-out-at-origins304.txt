<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Warning- if you are looking for high level play by play comentary and a detailed meta breakdown, this is not the place to look. However if you are looking for the story of a guy who had a good time at Origins despite crashing and burning in the Open and just enjoyed playing SWCCG and meeting other people who have similar interests then you are in the right place.<br>
<br>
I had made plans for Origins after missing out on the Corellia Regional. I figured I’d bus down there and stay with someone. My friend Ken Cross offered to let me stay in his apartment which worked out excellently. After much anticpation, I left early Friday morning for Columbus. I got to the Con around 10, and got ready for the Trek Open. It was my first real Trek tourney and I think I did well. Only 18 showed up to play, but I belive the 190+ playing in the LOTR open at the same time had a bit to do with that. I finished 3-3 on the day. I met up with Ken and returned to his place. We playtested a few games, and I was reasonably satisfied with my decks. We got back to the Con it time to finish our decklists and waited for the tourney to start.<br>
<br>
Light Deck-Veez Style QMC<br>
Dark Deck-ISB Tanks<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs Matt "Old Skooler" Lush<br>
<br>
Well it wasnt gonna start easy. Matt had his WYS Raiders going up against my ISB tanks. I got a pretty quick start, flipin 2nd turn with 4 agents on Tat thanks to v-Sunsdown.He got V-Luke up. I set my tanks up on Tat with Droid racks to make battles nasty. Han and the pissy Wookie came after a Tank and after the carnage the site was cleared. I retreated to my DB’s to drain, but he Projection the Yavin 4 DB and I was to busy otherwise to move away. Thrawn and the Chimera took it to V-Luke when he wandered over to Caridia, but Thrawn went down because of his Darklighter Spin. We had a few more battles, he set up Celebration, I used the MM/Endor Ocupation combo on it, but he got it going again and I couldnt find my canceler again. In the end, it was real close. Time was called and he ended his turn. We counted it up and we both had 17 cards left, but he was playing WYS, so he wins.<br>

Game 2 vs Michael Rhodbeck<br>
<br>
Michael is a local player from Mansfield who has a pretty good TDIGWATT deck. Unfortunately for him, my QMC trys to runs circles around such decks when it gets going. Also he did not opt for the quick Executor start (which I was prepared for). Our EPP Jedi went at it quickly, so he grabbed Jedi Resilance, which proved to be a mistake. I fliped quick and locked down the system. I soon started on all my quick QMC tricks, Pathing around and etc. Celebration was set up and it was just a matter of time, as I mainly avoided him while continuing to retrive. <br>

Game 3 vs Steve Miller<br>
<br>
Steve started AOBS with all the Surgeon Tricks. First turn Palpy camped out the GQ so that hindered me a bit. I got to space quick and then to my other sites to flip, while Xizor made his way to the Death Star DB. Eventually Qui Gon hit Palpy and Blast Pro’d him out of the battle, but I drew crap destiny so it wasnt a huge beatdown. He came after me at the system, but somehow missed the fact I had X-wing cannons up there. Wedge blasted Zuckuss and Bossk got hammered for a good amount. I set up Celebration and just retrived. He had very few weapons left to come at me with and soon withered away. <br>

Game 4 vs Ken Cross<br>
<br/>
Just wonderful. Nothing like a rematch of the game you playtested the night before. Even worse, I got skooled that game. He had podprofit cooking. I altered my strat somewhat, since I knew he was shipless. We had some nasty battles on the ground, but the atriton actually forced me to flip back my ISB, which proved to be big. Without retrival, I was screwed as Profit kept hitting me and was not retriving. Unfortunatley this one also timed out.<br/>

Game 5 vs James Booker<br/>
<br/>
I dont know why this phenomenon happens in big tourneys, but local players just keep playin each other. We need like sub-opens or something :-). Anyways Booker had  just about the worst thing this deck could face, A good TDIGWATT in the hands of a players who knows what to do with it. I got to space quick with super-Wedge, but reinforcements did not arive in time. Fett in Jett came out, and he dug for the Executor. I had Leia at her GQ and a pair of Alters in hand, but both failed, drawing a 5 and 4. Wedge got taken to town, but I ditched 11 force to keep him up there. Luke came in next turn, but I couldnt crack any imunity. I lost force a couple turns to keep them up there while they kept getting hammered. I used virtual Rebel Reinforcements to try and get some help but it was no good. His mains moved in, and it didnt take long for me to crack and break<br/>

Game 6 vs Jim Li<br/>
<br/>
Jim had racing and WYS. We both drew a lot early to get set up. I unleashed the Super Chimera with Thrawn, Paellon, Godheart on it adding Guri and Evax later for good measure. I then moved out from Carida and chased his guys between Kessel and Tat, but never stuck them in place. I got a nice chain of After Her! going to keepin him running and me retriving. He chased my tanks on the ground with Han and his Pissy Wookie friend. I got close to time and I had 5 while he had like 16 so I just drew up. <br/>

4 (-26)<br/>
<br/>
That really sucked. Also the fact that I faced none of the Decks that I wanted to try and beat (QMC, Senate, Combat). We got back to Ken’s place like 9 and I took some time to pick thru his Theed commons, mixed it with some of the Rares from my binder. I was gonna build a new light, but after realizing it went 2-1 on the day with positive dif led me to spare it for now. Veez’s Invasion pile was assembled and I went to get some sleep before heading to the last day of the Con. I entered as member of Team "White Trash Always"<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Ted P <br/>
<br/>
I’d rather not attempt to butcher Ted’s name here. Anyways, he Had Light LSC vs my Invasion. In the words of Mr. Burns "excellent...." I set up quick with a scrub Nemodian and some Battle droids. He works a bit to kick me out of the skys with H,C in the Falcon. Fine by me, now they are stranded at a non- BG system. We battle a lot, I set up some Naboo Occupation for a choke. Finally HCF went OOP and I took back the system with some droid starfighters. Eventually I just spread and drain enough to out last him. A real fun game.<br/>

Game 2 vs Andy McClure.<br/>
<br/>
I finally face a real Dark Senate. I set up resonably quick, but so does he. I bust a few Alters on his nice effects, but he uses one of his Poli Effects to get it back. He takes my sites over and activates mad amounts thanks to Tikes and his Holocam. I try and attack, but SFS guns plus ColoClawFish= dead falcon. He starts drainin and quickly runs me right out of the game as most of my battle go nowhere. It just ugly.<br/>

Game 3 vs Pat B. (Boorts?)<br/>
<br/>
Pat says hes been out of the game for a while. He hasnt seen any of the V-cards out there. He’s got Endor Ops. I get a horrible draw, and spend 5 turns looking for a ship to flip with. I quickly do, set up Menace Fades and some good combos. A super Falcon takes over Endor, and I just drain and retrive for a while till he dies, but then forget to count up my cards.<br/>
<br/>
FW by we’ll call it 20<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Andy McClure<br/>
<br/>
We’ll this turns out to be a somewhat better matchup. He’s got Light Senate vs my Invasion. He sets up and actaully puts the queen in Senate. The key seems to be about the 4th turn or so. I draw up to find a Nemiodian to put in the Throne room to flip while he still hasnt really made a move. I get a pair of Theed Runes, so when he drains the next turn, I ditch one to a drain. Then he plays OOC with like 4 cards in the lost. What does he get, Rune of course. The next turn Qui-Gon and Screamin Lando take the Throne Room, never to relequinish. In the meantime, I’ve been stackin ships at the system to get ready for the flip, so now I have like +7 power in battles on the planet. We battle a lot, I Oh Switch Off like all his weapons and put my droids on the rack, man they have piss poor forfeit. He kills OWO-1 and crew like 3 times. He’s holding a site or 2 and not losing many cards. Still some of his guys get trounced. Valoruim got taken for like all the senate manip he could do to my stuff, forfiet and then like 5 more. But the retrival is too much, he slowly wears me down and I take another big loss to help Team Canadian Bacon to the top spot. <br/>

So thats all for the games. I stick around for a while to chill then say goodbye to Ken and return to the gaming area. McClure and the  South crew are hangin out, so I play some more games, winning by 1 in cool game vs Ben (?Atkins). The guys are nice enough to let me hang out till late when my bus comes. We take a long ride to get dinner, experincing the strangeness and hilarity that is (Sean, Shawn? somethin like that) and talk tech and other fun stuff. They drop me off at the Greyhound station like 10:30 and I wait two hours for my late bus. A cool experince was Origins 2002<br/>
