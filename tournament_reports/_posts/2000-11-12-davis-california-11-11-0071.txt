<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Heres a TR from a tourny in Davis California that I just went to.  Read it TR is now<br>
<br>
<br>
Before<br>
<br>
Well after this horrible week of the 2nd week of wrestling Friday is finally here and preperation <br>
for the tourny is starting.  So I have the normal people over... Brandon and Chris to play some <br>
games and some video games.  Brandon had to go the a wrestling clinic on Saturday so he couldn’t<br>
go with us but help us prepare for the tourny.  It ends up Chris is going to play one of Brandon’s<br>
decks which is his BHBM heavy tie space.  Well we go off and spend 2 hours playing Bond and such<br>
They finally decide to leave around 1 which is cool.  So I get some sleep and wake up for 1 last <br>
deck check before and finally were off.<br>
<br>
<br>
We don’t get lost getting to the place but there is not parking around the store.  But after a<br>
few minutes of us driving around we find a good spot in front of the store.  Chris and I go <br>
inside and see a whole bunch of pokemon players which isn’t cool.  So we go get some lunch and <br>
come back to see Robert Selby and Carl Hardy arriving.  We talk some decks and wait for all the <br>
people who couldnt find parking.  Finally the tourny starts.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1 LS vs Sean Pon’s straight non flipping court<br>
<br>
Well first game.  Ive heard alot about Sean and was kinda worried about how this was gonna go.  He starts off with Mob Points and the regular court stuff.  He drops Mighty Jabba to Tat Db first turn to get his activation up and draws up some.  I drop down Obi with saber pull some <br/>
systems and battle.  get the chop and draw a 1 so he loses jabba and 1.  He draws up for a few turns while i get systems out and drop Obi wan Kenobi to tat db.  he then goes mara and her saber to the AC.  I decide to make an attack deploy luke and he plays none shall pass so i draw a few and get leia with blaster and han with blaster.  On his turn Mighty Jabba and 4-Lom Comes down. I drop leia, han and luke to the ac and battle i hack jabba and shot 4-lom while he blanks hans text and misses the hack.  i clear the site and lose han.  Then he decides to take some offense <br/>
with danick jerico, dengar with gun, ig with gun and dr e battles and shots han and eats lukes soup while i kill off 3 of his guys.  Then i end it with Nien Numb, Lando, Wedge and Tycho against Dannick <br/>
and Dr E.  FW +22<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Highs: winning<br/>
Lows: Playing a scrub<br/>
<br/>
Well then we take a lunch break thats about an hour long while i take decks with Selby and how he thinks<br/>
his ls can beat my ds.  After a while the tourny starts up again<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 ls vs Chris Green "I’m playing B Bales BHBM ties"<br/>
<br/>
Ya it seems i always get to play someone in my car.  Well we start.  I drop tycho wedge and obi with saber to <br/>
ds 2 dbay where his only emperor is.  I battle and hack emperor and loses about 11 force.  I can find luke anywhere<br/>
in my deck or lost pile so i lose about 9 from your destiny and 6 or 7 from his drains over 3 turns.  Great.  <br/>
I start spreading and draining but in the end his drains were too much from the start and i lost too many <br/>
valuable cards FL -8<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Killing Emperor<br/>
Lows: Playing someone in my car<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs Chris Greens Profit maddness<br/>
<br/>
Again we play.  I start off with Boba and Hutt in the AC.  I My turn i drop Janus and Emperor to JP and start the <br/>
drains.  He drops Luke with Saber from deck to Ac and battles.  I miss shot he chops jabba and draws a 4.  I draw<br/>
6 and 2 he loses luke and 1 and 1 to isng rebellion.  I drain him for 3 for about 2 turns untill he drops Luke with <br/>
saber to emperors site misses hack on emperor and draws 4 to kill Janus but has to stack another card.  He finally<br/>
frees with chewie with blaster and sets up some drains with Kenobi and stick to JP.  Emperor is now on death star ready for dueling with vader sitting at Endor DBay.  He gives luke and i set up my Admiral Order with Igar.  I start Dueling making him lose 3 a turn.  Then i end it with Mara and her saber to the AC You R Beaten Chewie and battle han.  Chop him and draw a 5 for 11 and he lose 7 force which leaves him with 3.  FW +17<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Getting him locked down with battle order<br/>
Lows:  Not much<br/>
<br/>
Well after talking to Mike it seems like me winning the tourny relies on someone else winning by less than 33.<br/>
So I stand outside waiting for them to finish.  It ends up he wins by 27. <br/>
<br/>
So I win my 2nd tourny going 3-1 but all and all good day and lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
the Prizes werent so great i got a Dlots Foil which is preety cool.<br/>
<br/>
Well hope you enjoyed my tr check back later for another 1 soon.<br/>
