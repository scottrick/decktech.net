<blockquote><font class="bfont"> TR from Los Gatos from last week....its a bit late, but, oh well....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prelude<br>
<br>
So its the weekend of the first DPC and it sucks because I cant be there. Im sitting at home with nothing to do on Sat so I look up a tourney and I find one in Los Gatos and a town thats past Sacto, which is like 3 hours away so I decide to head to Gatos instead. <br>
<br>
Im strapped for decks to play so I make an ISB since that deck wrecked me the past week and Im sick of Hunt Down. For LS I remade my TIGIH mad destiny deck after it tore up last week at Pleasonton for Kevin Shannon and Clayton Atkin. Im feeling like a scrub though after last week so I have a few friends over and playtest my crap to make sure it actually works this time.<br>
<br>
I hook up with John Monroe again and were off at 9 in the freakin morning.....why does she constantly hold her tourneys at 10? Were there at 10 and we see the new Squadron Members Nick Stefanko and Steve Daniel. I made a janky RalOps deck and me and Nick go at it before the tourney but the TD cuts us off and starts the tournament.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE DECKS<br>
<br>
DS: ISB Speed Scum: ISB + Gailid &amp; Mosep + Scum + JP = all you need to piss off your opponent<br>
<br>
LS: TIGIH Mad Destinies: TIGIH that CAN cross Vader with mad destinies and some retrieval thrown in the mix<br>
<br>
<br>
THE GAME<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS vs. Steve Daniels LS EBOX<br>
<br>
ISB vs EBO = one big drain race. Im having trouble drawing my JP so he gets set up first. I draw JP and set up Scum and flip ISB 4th turn and the drain race commences. He drops X-wings to Hoth and Corulag. I move my ORS around JP and drop 2 to Hoth to slow his drains. I draw and find Gailid and Resistance and I know hes gone. He drops Scout Luke to the ORS on Hoth and kills one off, but I retaliate and retrieve a few in the process as well. Zuckuss takes Corulag and now Gailid makes my JP drains even bigger. Im retrieving with Scum and First Strike because he doesnt want to lose Luke, but IG eventually captures him anyways. He’s draining for 3 to my 12 and thats all I got to say about that. Win by 22.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+22)<br>
Highs: Nothing much<br/>
Lows: Beating Steve around like a monkey<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs. some out of it kid’s Hunt Down Hardcore Dueling<br/>
<br/>
The kid acts like hes on dope and looks like hes 10 years old. Luke walks over to the Endor Dbay first turn and he drops DLOTS to take Luke. He lost Vader from hand to Visage first turn and I pray for an OOC but I dont get it. Blount comes down to Executor to cancel Visage and sit there with a few scouts. Im draining there for 2 practically the whole game because he hesitates to do anything about it. Hes leaving Vader alone so down comes Ben w/ stick and a few scouts to win my first battle. He comes back with Tarkin and another Vader and epics Obi by cheating with Tarkin....but my scouts win the battle again and thats 2. He wipes off my scouts at Endor so I drop Boussh to block his drains. Im getting sick of draining for only 2 so I drop another scout at Executor and move 2 to Vaders Chamber leaving the other 2 alone. He doesnt have much force left because he overdrew the past few turns, and he drops EJP Dengar and Dr. E to Vaders chamber to whoop on my scout for 6.....then he moves Dengar over like a scrub and I battle him, win #3, draw the 6 and cross Vader for the game. Win by 14.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+36)<br/>
Highs: Playing that close game<br/>
Lows: He had this one if he didnt move Dengar over like a scrub....then again I wouldve battled him anyways with Corran and Orri in hand....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point only me and Nick are undefeated. Nicks brother has a win but with a bye and hes not going to win his next game by 40 so its me and Nick on game 3. Steve and I break off for some Raw Deal and my Triple H beats his Stone Cold like he does at No Way Out and the TD starts acting up again and starts game 3.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. Nick Stefankos LS WYS<br/>
<br/>
Nick sees Im playing DS and hes pretty much given up hope already. I get a GOD start with 3 ORS, an Abbyssin, JP, and Twilek. Down comes JP and AC first turn and I draw and find Jabba as well. He drops Outrider to space and draws. I Twilek, drop Scum, Jabba, Gailid, 4 ORS, and the Lower Corridors with POTF at the AC to flip ISB and give him a scare. He drops a Patrol Craft and Palace Raider to Dbay 94,  but he cant drain so I leave him alone. I drain for 4, and he loses off the top Kessel and Menace Fades, the 2 cards that couldve saved his life. From there I get Mosep down, and its over shortly thereafter. Win by 27. <br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 6(+62)<br/>
Highs: Nothing too much<br/>
Lows: Having to have Nick go through that......wrecked through WYS decks like I thought it would. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs. John Monroes DS Hunt Down <br/>
<br/>
Man I hate Hunt Down.....John and I are the only ones left undefeated so I go head to head with my ride AGAIN. This games pretty uneventful as we stayed away from each other practically the whole game. DLOTS takes Luke and runs to the Executor. I drop Blount and a few guys to Executor and he starts committing people there to stop my drains. He killed everyone but Blount in a battle and I kill a few guys and make Blount Undercover. Down comes the Back Door and I set up a squad of scouts and Midge there and he starts moving out of the Executor. He hesistates to move to the Back Door due to my massive power and scout tricks, so he stays and starts draining instead at the Hut and Dbay. He drops Battle Order and gets Zuckuss to secure Rendili. Im draining for about 4 total to his 8 so I move over to entice a few battles. He runs from me and I Signal for OTE he loses a few force but ultimately, he battles me alot and people start dying. Time starts to run out real quickly, and the TD starts acting up AGAIN and she calls time on us as things get down to the wire.....had I a few more minutes I wouldve found my Off the Edge and won.....Ack....Timed Loss by 9.<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6(+53)<br/>
Highs: Great game that lasted down to the wire....we both had the chance to finish the game in our favor, he just beat me to it.<br/>
Lows: TD is REALLY getting to me...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That last game was for the tourney, so John takes the tourney and gets the EPP Han Box Topper the store gave us....I dont mind getting second all that much because I got the EPP Leia Box Topper instead of what wouldve been my third Han. Prizes sucked, more R2 junk to add to my stack and I get a Japanese DS Cantina though which isnt bad. <br/>
<br/>
Afterwards I watch Steve and Nick go at what is possibly the slowest game I have EVER seen(Trek seems like Young Jedi compared to this), Age of Empires CCG. The computer games cool but I cant say the same for the CCG. <br/>
John cant stay too long so Steve and I play some more Raw Deal and Trips beats Tazz around like a dork and we play some L5R then I jet home with John at 4 in the freakin afternoon......so I pass out on my bed and wake up at night to write this thing. <br/>
<br/>
Im going to Pleasonton this week and probably DPC Vegas when that rolls around....check you all later. Oh, and The Rocks song sucks on Volume 5.<br/>
