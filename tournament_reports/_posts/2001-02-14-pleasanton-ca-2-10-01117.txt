<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This tourney report coming at you straight from Warmasters in Pleasanton, CA.  Nick<br>
 Stefanko was the TD, and since only 10 people showed, he played in the tourney as<br>
 well to make it 11.  I was playing Court Scum for dark which starts Power of the Hutt,<br>
 AWU, and No Bargain.  For light, I use EBO xwings starting Battle Plan, Wise Advice,<br>
 and Insight.  BTW, Nick Stefanko gave a report of this tourney, but I wanted to give<br>
 mine too.<br>
<br>
 Game 1: DS vs John Monroe’s HB Mains (started Insurrection &amp; 2 others)<br>
<br>
 I deployed baby Jabba w/ Ephont Mon &amp; Scum to the Chamber 1st turn.  I grab DS2 Docking<br>
 bay &amp; deploy Tat system.  He deploys Tat DB and puts EPP Leia there.  I deploy sail<br>
 barge from reserve to Leia, deploy Bane for 2, &amp; put Feltipern at the Passenger deck<br>
 for free.  Battle, he misses the shot on Bane and Bane captures Leia, then moves to<br>
 the Passenger deck.  I fortify the Chamber but he uses Ben Kenobi w/saber and Jedi<br>
 Luke to kill Ephont, then Lando w/Ax helps them out.  I don’t know why he didn’t use<br>
 Lando to beat down Bane &amp; Feltipern in the Passenger deck, I forgot to ask him.<br>
<br>
 But I get to capture Jedi Luke and flip.  So I deploy Sarlacc, move Leia and Luke<br>
 over to be eaten.  Leia is easily eaten, but Luke takes me 2 tries until he is eaten.<br>
  I retrieve a ton, he loses a ton, and a short while later thats game.  Win by 27.<br>
  2 (+27)<br>
<br>
 Game 2: LS vs Nick Stefanko’s TDIGWATT (starts Mob Pts, IAO, &amp; something)<br>
<br>
 He puts Chiraneau at Exec DB, I Signal for ANSB.  Then he puts Tagge alone at CC DB,<br>
 saves 1 force.  I risk it and deploy Comm Wedge in Rogue 3, battle, he reacts with<br>
 Tempest 6.  He draws a 4, I draw a 5, so he’s cleared &amp; Wedge is immune thanks to<br>
 EBG.  I move wedge to Hoth DB.  I set EBO up before he sets up DD or CC Occupation.<br>
  Two turns after he deploys DD &amp; Occ, I cancel DD w/xwings, Zev in Rogue 2 and EPP<br/>
 Obi.  I also move 7 xwings to the Executor at Bespin system (trying to cancel CC Occ).<br/>
  Apparantly he was playing heavy ATSTs to defend CC, so that meant my speeders could<br/>
 travel on CC.  I was afraid he would be using interior sites.<br/>
<br/>
 He deploys Dengar in ship, Thrawn, &amp; Bossk in ship to Bespin, battle.  I play <br/>
 Organized Attack.  I had saved 3 force to shoot my laser cannons, but missed dengar.  <br/>
 I lose Spiral &amp; 2 xwings, then during my turn I move to spread at my 3 other systems.  <br/>
 He follows (to block my huge drains), then I deploy 1 xwing to Bespin to cancel CC Occ.<br/>
 By now I also have control of the ground (Rogue squadron is flying all over CC in <br/>
 speeders).  Boushh and EPP Obi are also draining.  I use AWRI then replace 6 xwings <br/>
 w/ 2 squadrons to boost my differential.  Win by 25.  4 (+52)<br/>
<br/>
 Game 3: DS vs Clayton Atkin’s TIGIH (starts Staging Areas, Insurrection, ??)<br/>
<br/>
 Clayton is the California Champ, so he and Kevin Shannon were 2 players I wanted to<br/>
 play today.  Kevin was playing Alex T. (newbie), so I knew whoever won this game would <br/>
 play Kevin for the tourney win.  He deployed Crix to Home 1 DB, COK &amp; Wuta to Endor DB.<br/>
  I had Mara, so I went after Crix, swung and hit him for a 6 force loss on 2nd turn.<br/>
  Great.  Now he can’t pull his scouts.  He used EPP Obi and Orrimaarko to battle Mara,<br/>
 but he only drew a 2 for destiny.  So I just lost 5 force and kept Mara at the DB.<br/>
  So he forfeited Orri, &amp; moved Obi w/COK at Endor DB.  I drained for 2, then he deployed<br/>
 some other guys who killed Mara, but not enough so that I had to take battle damage.<br/>
  That was the last battle.<br/>
<br/>
 Later, I forgot to pull Hutt Influence, so he Assualted my drain at the Chamber. <br/>
 I lost 3 force there, then pulled Hutt Influence.  I deployed Sullust and sent Zuckuss<br/>
 w/4-LOM &amp; Brangus Glee there.  Turns out he had no ships, so I wasted 4-LOM in space.<br/>
  It was just a drain race, since he refused to come to Tatooine, losing to Court all<br/>
 game.  But that drain by Luke also hit me all game.  Since no battles really took<br/>
 place, I couldn’t retrieve w/Scum or Sarlacc.  He retrieved w/2 Off the Edges at his<br/>
 CC DB (5 force each time), and he ended up outlasting me.  Lose by 8 force.  4 (+44)<br/>
<br/>
 I don’t know how that game slipped away from me.  He didn’t even have any big drains.<br/>
  So he and Kevin played for 1st place, since both were undefeated.<br/>
<br/>
 Game 4: LS vs Alex Thompson’s Space Court (starts No Bargain, POTH, AWU)<br/>
<br/>
 Alex had been doing really well today.  We both knew each other’s decks since we had<br/>
 playtested together.  We knew each other’s decks EXACTLY.  Basically his deck is meant<br/>
 to set up Tat Occ, We’re in Attack Position Now, and Expand the Empire on Lars’ Farm<br/>
 (or Jundland Wastes) to drain you to death.  He pulls ships w/ Court, but doesn’t<br/>
 use Scum since he has other ships as well.  <br/>
<br/>
 Against me, he set up Expand just fine on his 2nd turn, but I deployed Boushh there<br/>
 right away to block it and stop the loss to Court every turn.  My Rebel Fleet was<br/>
 useless with his Hutt Influence out.  Nothing really happened until I set up EBO.<br/>
  Then he started sweating because he hadn’t even gotten the Tatooine system yet. <br/>
 He wasn’t activating a whole lot (13 force I think), which isn’t much for him because<br/>
 his stuff deploys for a lot of force and with my Incom Corp out, I quickly controlled<br/>
 my 3 systems w/2 xwings at each.<br/>
<br/>
 He deployed Tat system, I deployed 3 xwings there and replaced w/ a squadron (I had<br/>
 a small lost pile so I knew I woiuldn’t need a lot of xwings for AWRI).  I had Spiral<br/>
 in hand.  By now, Luke in Rogue 1 were at the North Ridge, and the rest of Rogue Squad<br/>
 were on Tat with Boushh &amp; EPP Obi.  I beat his crew of Mara, Kitik, Zuckuss &amp; Ree-yees,<br/>
 then I had control of Lars Farm, Jundland Wastes, Tat DB, &amp; Pit of Carkoon by spreading<br/>
 Boushh, Obi, and Rogue Squad around.  The massive drains all over beat him.  Win by<br/>
 22.  6(+66)<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin beat Clayton pretty soundly (Kevin was using QMC!), so I got 2nd place.  Kevin<br/>
 won a Veers tshirt for 1st, and I got 2 R2 packs (my first 2 R2 packs!).  IMHO, I<br/>
 got the better deal (I’ll take 2 packs over a shirt any day, especially since I didn’t<br/>
 have any R2).  Pulled Pulsar Skate, No Questions Asked, Blaster Prof combo, Alter<br/>
 combo (light side), Tempest Scout 1 foil, &amp; Walker Garrison foil.  <br/>
