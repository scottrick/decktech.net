<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Ohio states, June 7th 2003. clASSic format. 13 participants (3 more than the lotr psq going on in the same room, heh).<br>
<br>
*****PRE-TOURNEY*****<br>
(you can skip this part if you want)<br>
So after the circle-jerk at PA states (my home state) im left still searching for a bye into day 2 so that if/when i travel to worlds this year i wont hafta stay an extra day in a hotel. i look up some other nearby state tournies and see ohio's is june 7th, but the only details on the PC site are "TBA." so i email the TD and he replies and turns out it's a classic tourney. so im like whatever ill play in it anyway and i request off work for the day and make my visit to mapquest and get to work on classic decks.<br>
<br>
i obviously dont want to play speeders cuz everyone SHOULD be prepared for that deck. and it's not so good a deck that even if you prepare for it, you will still lose to it. and i figure that people will prolly be playin isb cuz some people think that isb is a good match against speeders (tho it really isnt). anyway blah blah blah i end up with a hidden base flip matching pilot deck with order to engage and legendary starfighter.<br>
<br>
for dark i'm playing dark deal starting ket maliss so i can pull greedo, beedo, reegesk and dark deal second turn if i need to. and it's got uh take evasive action x2 and hoth ice plains? i dunno if those are good cards or not but i guess i'll find out.<br>
<br>
i get an hour of sleep thurs night, work 8-5, do something on friday night that i dont really remember but i get 4 hours of sleep that night then wake up and leave for ohio at 7 am. tourney registration opens at 10. mapquest says it'll take me 2 hours and 24 minutes to get there. hop in the RSmith One and get the system going with some burned cds...<br>
<br>
Mapquest estimated travel time: 2 hours and 24 minutes<br>
Actual RSmith One transit time: 2 hours and 20 minutes<br>
Direction accuracy level: 100%<br>
Overall Mapquest rating for this trip: 10 of 10<br>
<br>
also i gotta throw in the obligatory jab at ohio drivers, the worst in the united states as far as im concerned. but i was mentally prepared for them, i knew i would be driving through the Armpit State and i knew i would have to deal with its drivers.<br>
<br>
*****ACTUAL GAME DETAIL BEGINS HERE*****<br>
(the part you must read)<br>
<br>
ok repeat for those who skipped the intro: dark deck = dark deal: starts YCHF/MP, Im Sorry, and Ket Maliss. light deck = hb flip: starts Strike Planning, Squadron Assignments, and either Do Or Do Not &amp; Wise Advice or Menace Fades<br>
<br>
GAME ONE<br>
My dark vs. Brad Eier's (1928) MWYHL<br>
I looked up Brad's rating...and he has two. 1928 and 1594..so i hope i get the 1928 one, heh. but the 1594 is more recent =/ screw decipher's ratings anyway<br>
<br/>
He starts wise advice and the way of things and...something else. I go and get greedo and two sites and the executor (my deck = the deck of the 12-card opening hand). Deploy the sites and pull the Cloud City sector (dont deploy it yet) and im preeeeety sure i had the free executor effect in hand too.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and gets Yoda (v) down at the Training Area and pulls test 2 so i guess he had test 1 in hand or something. i dont remember the first few turns that well but i DO remember that he finished test 1 before i was able to set up dark deal. and he's training DOS.<br/>
<br/>
So i get Occupation set up instead with greedo/beedo/regis and he starts losing random.starfighters to that and my drains and regis takes em and eventually i lose two of his cards from hand to play the CHYBC shield, that's a lot of fun. and dont try to tell me that regis cant steal vehicles or starfighters. he's completing the tests rather rapidly although i do move test 2 off of the jungle so as to stall him an extra turn. for all the newbs: NEVER let test 2 stay on the jungle. trust me. also he's playing approx. 17 copies of visored vision non-v so after i play one twilek advisor i know better than to play any more used interrupts.<br/>
<br/>
he makes a questionable move by dropping lando in falcon with epp luke as pilot to square off with whatever starfighter i had there (i think it might have just been the stinger with no pilot) and i ghhhked out of it. he could have dropped epp luke to a site but i guess he figured i just had a stunning leader anyway (and of course i did).<br/>
<br/>
anyway i dealt a TON of damage this game between occupation (which only worked for 3 or 4 turns as he kept canceling it with free ride and i burnt my hell to pay on it could be worse and couldnt find my second) and ping drains of 1,1,1,1,1 and s&amp;d but his yoda retrieval kept him hanging in there...even tho he only got as far as test 4 i ended up winning this one by just 13.<br/>
<br/>
highs: good deck, good opponent, good game<br/>
lows: decipher ratings<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME TWO<br/>
My light vs Matt Scott's (2076) dark deal brian fred style<br/>
Well at least this is a matchup i had tested. he starts im sorry, tintoe, and ychf/mob points. i start strike planning, squadass, and menace fades.<br/>
<br/>
he goes and starts pulling stuff and deploying stuff, he's playing all interior sites of course but he's also playing the docking bay (i'm not). i get dash to the rpoint for 3 and fly him free to endor.<br/>
<br/>
matt is not playing ket maliss deal so he takes a little while getting characters to put at his sites. meanwhile i get virtual luke out and he pulls all wings combo for me every turn so that i can get other guys (wedge, general calrissian and nien nunb) out and they go to endor so im draining for 1 (cuz he sho' dont wanna lose 2 to play battle order). strike planning pulls rieekan who pulls romas lock who (combined with the objective) pulls all my systems out pretty fast. matt got the free ex out pretty fast so he's drainin me at bespin too.<br/>
finally he gets some characters down (prophetess, emperor, janus) and some mo' ships at the system and deploys occupation, then puts a ship at the sector too so he can deploy dark deal. I deploy as much as i have and move EVERYONE over to bespin to challenge him for the system. I also got boussh and tk-422 down on bespin to block a couple drains.<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like this: he has the Executor with Thrawn as pilot along with Guri on the Stinger and 2 or 3 TIE Interceptors at the system (no cannons though....did i mention that i deployed Special Modifications (v) on like turn 2 or 3? yeah he wasnt too happy about that. plus i had a few maneuvers in hand). All that against my Luke in Artoo/Red5, Wedge in his ship, Gen Cal and Nien in Gold Squad 1, Dash and some other random pilot in Outrider...and i think that's it. Plus he has Battle Deployment out so since i don't have a capital all my ships are power -2. and he knows i have legendary starfighter in hand cuz i signaled for it. he looks for something random in reserve deck and i verify to see 5,5,5. so he initiates battle and im like....."react" and i deploy the spiral and he basically shts himself because not only do i get the extra 5 power from the spiral...i now have a capital so all 4 of my starfighters get their 2 power back, and the outrider gets to reduce even more power...hahaaa. I darklighter spin for one destiny and draw decent for the other and wedge cancels one of his destinies and when the smoke clears it's my power....44 to his.....27. an EPIC battle. so he loses guri and thrawn and 3 force so that he doesnt have to lose a ship (and get legendaried), i forfeit some scrub pilot and rieekan. he moves all his guys away to my kashyyyk so that he wont get punked and legendaried on my turn.<br/>
<br/>
So i go and get Obiwan with Lightsaber out to a forest somewhere so that i satisfy menace fades and i drop Hobbie in his ship or somebody to the rendezvous point and move him for free to endor to give me an extra drain spot and i think i may have flipped my objective about here.<br/>
<br/>
so occupation is canceled and i have a firm grasp on bespin...i have undercover spies on bespin and obiwan at the forest satisfying menace fades and a flipped objective to cancel drains and legendary in hand to keep him from making any foolish moves in space...yeah i felt pretty much in control at this point. the only thing i was missing was order to engage, but i never found it all game. i play a few maneuvers at the end of one of his turns so that i could edge, and i freeeekin forgot about prophetess, so i activate one and he's like "prophetess" and im like "gay." but then i activate all but one and search with something random and the one card left is jedi knight luke, ha! so i get to edge anyway. oddly enough this happened THREE times during the game, he prophetessed and i activated all but one....the other two times i searched and found a 6 again (ill take the leader), and then a 5 (the signal). so between that and luke's retrieval i was able to get a decent amount of cards back. he attacked hobbie with zuckuss or something and i dunno what i did (i think i just forfeited hobbie) but then i came back with another ship (corran and something) and he was like "i cant believe you have MORE ships!" and i was like "hell yeah"<br/>
<br/>
he got arica to the forest pretty fast so i never drained there, but i spread out and drained pretty well in space and eventually ran him out of cards. he moved back to bespin after i spread out to try and occupation again but it was too late. i dont even remember if i ever got legendary out. FW by 15.<br/>
<br/>
good: 44 to 27<br/>
bad: prophetess<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME THREE<br/>
my dark vs Jamie Abel's (1887) RST<br/>
Jamie showed up late and was given a bye for the first game and won his second so he has 4 victory points and pretty solid diff i guess. his deck starts the shield is down, strike planning, and cell 2187 so that he can pull ANH r2d2 to play how did we get into this mess?<br/>
<br/>
at least that's how it was supposed to work. i pull my ket maliss guys and set up dark deal (with a tie interceptor) and search and destroy second turn and start draining for an obscene amount. the only defense card in my hand for the first 5 turns or so was ghhhk so i was hoping he didnt bring too much ruckus to bespin...and he didnt. he deployed red leader in red 1 to cloud city sector to square off against my interceptor and drew a blind 6 for destiny so there went the ghhhk. but nothing else ever came to bespin, and after i dropped zuckuss to clear RLiR1 off a turn or two later he stayed completely away. he deployed r2d2 to the back door, but never once played hdwgitm. he deployed crix and a ton of scouts (including jedi knight luke) and moved them all into the bunker, but he kept losing explosive charges off his deck to my drains and S&amp;D. i stole those at every opportunity with regis (although i was later informed that i couldnt do this? wtf). and then i lost two explosive charges from hand to play the CHYBC shield, heh.<br/>
<br/>
i couldnt find the free executor effect so i had no space presence except zuckuss at the sector, and he had lost 2 to pull battle plan, so my turns were mostly me paying 9 to drain for 9. sounds like a fair trade to me.<br/>
he eventually got one charge into the bunker along with all his scouts, but was losing way too much too fast to deal and S&amp;D. one turn he moved jedi knight luke out to the back door and i was like "lose to S&amp;D" and he was like "how?" and im like "jedi knight luke sho' aint destiny &lt; 4." then i put arica there to block that drain. ouch. he tried to blow the bunker once or twice but with one charge it's tough. after i drained him out he showed me the two cards left in his hand: endor celebration (old school non-combo) x2. he said "if i could have put these back and tracked them, i could have blown the bunker" and i said "why not combo version?" and he said "i dont own it" somebody trade this guy some free ride combos please! =P even if he had blown it, chybc would have canceled his retrieval and me losing 8 force really wouldnt have hurt much.<br/>
FW by 28 or 29<br/>
<br/>
good: speed deal<br/>
bad: rlir1 and a blind 6 = spanking<br/>
<br/>
GAME FOUR<br/>
my light vs Brad Eier's ISB without ORS<br/>
after this tournament i became convinced that there are no outer rim scouts in ohio. cuz i saw plenty o' isb that day, but not a single ors.<br/>
<br/>
anyway this was a pretty good game. brad started with typical isb stuff (iao combo, mofopoints combo, and decree) and did the pull ex dbay put piett and merrejk there stuff and started pulling systems. so between his systems and mine we were both generating obscene amounts of force from like turn 3 on.<br/>
<br/>
i got luke pretty early this game too and used his text repeatedly to get all wings and more ships. brad got the ex out to fondor real quick-like and backed it up with devastator and pilots out the wazoo. he kept playing imp command and i for the life of me couldnt find the dam grabber or my signal. i did however locate order to engage on turn 5 or so so i knew what i had to do to win the game.<br/>
<br/>
brad twileked for come with me and pulled admiral cheerio first thing, but i had obiwan at the forest again (obi's a real outdoors kinda guy) so menace fades cut that out some of the time.<br/>
<br/>
eventually he got bored of draining me for 1 a turn at fondor and losing to my plink drains, so he spread his ships out a bit and i started chasing him around with order to engage. he was able to fight rather effectively with the large amounts of force he was activating, and i did incur some losses from battle. i kept waiting for the lateral damage but it never reared its ugly head. he put epp vader down at the endor docking bay and i responded with tk-422 to block the drain. he would later put come with me into used pile to take vader into hand but vader never came back into play. obiwan got smacked pretty hard by a couple of walkers and i had to on the edge him to get him the hell outta there so i wouldnt take overflow. and there went menace fades.<br/>
i got lieutenant blount out pretty early and stuck him at coruscant with some backup (cuz with all the force gen going on, a beatdown could take place at anytime) so the 7 side of brad's objective didnt see too much light this game. i flipped midway through the game and it took him a few turns to find my base (although when he did, it was huge as it added 5 cards back to his life force).<br/>
<br/>
so i found out why brad wasnt playing ors: he WAS playing imperial domination (v) - two of them, to be exact. and me without my aim high shield =/ so between that and the fact that i was retrieving with v luke and on the edge, this game dragged on....and on... and on.... my main sources of damage were order to engage and a few plink drains in space, while he drained me at my forest and wherever he could in space. finally time was called as brad was finishing up his turn, he had no cards in hand and four in life force and i could only damage him for 3 on my turn....so he drew the one card and lost the other 3 from life force to give me a full win in a game that could have gone either way. thanks brad. FW by 10?<br/>
<br/>
good: a great game, ugggh had to think a lot this game<br/>
bad: play got kinda sloppy towards the end, i think we both missed some stuff<br/>
<br/>
GAME FIVE (aka no rest for the weary)<br/>
my dark deal vs matt scott's qmc<br/>
man im tired, i just had a long game which took a lot of thinking, and no break in between cuz we played the entire hour. sux0r<br/>
<br/>
anyway he starts 3 effects and leia's hut, i start my usual. i think half my hand was cards i could search for but thats ok. i had no free executor effect or twilek but the effect was in my force pile after i activated so i drew for it. i really was too tired to remember which sites to deploy and which sites to hold, cuz i know some sites have a light and dark version and some dont. the only one i knew for sure was the chasm walkway so i held that (even tho i also remembered that the lightside chasm walkway sucks).<br/>
<br/>
so it turns out there is a lightside west gallery and he converted that.<br/>
<br/>
anyway i got the ex out with guri on the stinger to the system and my ket maliss guys to the sites for occupation and S&amp;D and a tie interceptor to the sector for dark deal. he puts a bunch of friggin arconas on cloud city and i suddenly realize that i dont have a single card in my deck to stop reacts. whoops. at least occupation is still hittin him for 4 a turn and i usually get a drain of 1 or 2 off here or there. dark deal gets canceled pretty easily by him occupying 4 locations.<br/>
<br/>
so he throws a bunch of ships up at the system to fight my executor, shoots guri down with an xwing cannon, and informs me that regis cant steal xwing cannons and im like dammit why not? so then he loses the falcon somewhere and i steal that instead. anyway i had tie cannons galore in my hand but i just was too dam unfocused to get my destiny straight for them and with all his ships being pretty high maneuver i couldnt risk spending all that force for what might not amount to anything. so i held off on the cannons and used my force primarily for putting extra guys on the executor so i could keep it around. guri, vader, whoever, they all went on there as forfeit so that the ex could stay and occupation could keep working its magic. i had to lose a few cards in battle damage here and there also, but it was all good as long as i could keep the occ working.<br/>
<br/>
matt threw down an epp luke somewhere in there but i stunning leadered and then retaliated later on. basically nothing was going on on the ground, the game was focused on the system and how long i could keep the executor alive. i was pretty well force-choked this game for some reason, i know dark deal is supposed to choke qmc, not the other way around, but i think i held off on converting the sector because i did not want to be drained for 2 there. whatever.<br/>
<br/>
anyway finally he beat me by some double digits in power at the system, so it was either lose a bunch of cards or toss the executor, i did a quick life force eyeball exam and decided i could finish him off without occupation. down went the ex and we exchanged drains for the rest of the game - him draining me for 2 at bespin and me draining 1 and 1 around his arconas at the sites. he loses 2 to pull battle plan but i always have enough to pay for the drains. FW by 6<br/>
<br/>
good: the W<br/>
bad: force choke<br/>
<br/>
GAME SIX (aka im already in the final)<br/>
my HB vs Jamie Abel's IO(v)<br/>
so this marks the first time in my 4-year tournament playing experiences that i have played in a 6-game tournament and only faced 3 different opponents.<br/>
<br/>
by now im way too tired to pay attention to what my opponent is starting, he could have started 9 effects all not immune to alter and i wouldnt have noticed. i do notice that i have an it could be worse opening hand, so i know whats gonna happen when he blows up the generators.<br/>
<br/>
i get some guys out to some systems and start draining for 1. luke on red 5 at aquaris lets me pull ships outta my deck and gives me mucho force to deploy them with. good deal.<br/>
<br/>
jamie goes to search once per game with the effect that lets him search once per game and all he gets is the third marker and im like "nah dude you gotta get a garrison too" and he's like "no dice" and im like "thats why you play two" and hes like "what happens if you draw them BOTH opening hand" and im like "then i guess you have pretty bad luck" so he cant get the third marker just yet.<br/>
<br/>
i figger he must have drawn the epic event opening hand too because first turn he searches with the objective to get an imperial walker (?) then second turn he pulls the at-at cannon and puts it on the walker with thrawn as pilot. well not having the third marker, at least that's one less site he has to walk.<br/>
i put some more ships out and save force for icbw and he goes and blows the generators and i gotta lose 8. so i spend 8 for icbw and ..... uhm ... he has ommni box/it's worse in hand, and 9 force in force pile?? so i have to lose.......seventeen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point i dont even want to finish the game, im like "good game, you win" but why do that and then sit around for 50 minutes while everyone else finishes their games? so i decide to play it out. fortunately i only lost one system and it wasnt my base, so i can still flip my objective i guess..... a lot of good that's gonna do me.<br/>
<br/>
so i start throwing random guys on random ships because all my matching pilot combos have either the ship or the pilot in the lost pile. i decide im just going to drain him for as much as i can in space and if he comes and jacks me up with star destroyers good, the game will be over that much faster.<br/>
<br/>
he starts pulling marker sites with his objective (eventually he would get the 3rd marker out this way) and gets tempest 1 down (forgets to take a card into hand with his objective) with igar and praji (v) piloting so im losing two a turn to that card that makes me lose force. he puts a star destroyer down somewhere and i move some guys over and somehow i think i beat it up and he lost it and i might have deployed legendary starfighter. the one matching pilot combo i DID have (cuz i got it out BEFORE he blew up the mpgs) was dash and outrider, so wedge went on there and at the same system as luke that's a pretty decent space force.<br/>
<br/>
anyway he got the 3rd marker out with the objective and moved tempest 1 there, leaving the imperial walker at the 5th marker. my guys are at hoth and i really have no choice but to land the outrider and get wedge and dash out. luke has to stay up in space so i can keep retrieving with him. jamie battles me with tempest 1, igar, and praji against my wedge, dash, and landed outrider, he draws two destinies and i draw a tracked 6. i lose the outrider and next turn put corran down to join wedge. sweet! now i have a battleground site!<br/>
so now im draining for 2 at the 3rd marker and 2 at the system, and losing a force to that card that makes me lose force. but luke is retrieving. and slowly i begin to realize.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that i am going to win this game. i think jamie moved his ships around some and drained me at kashyyyk for a while but i just kept draining for 2, draining for 2, and retrieving with luke. i did flip the objective (obviously if i was draining for 2 in space) so that helped me reduce damage somewhat. he either couldnt find or just chose not to ever deploy another walker, and after i drained him out i had 10 cards left. FW by 10<br/>
i went nuts and ran out of the building cuz i was totally pumped from not only going 6-0 but from completing the biggest comeback victory of my career. later i gave jamie my icbw and asked him to sign it but then i left and forgot to get it from him, doh<br/>
<br/>
high: guess<br/>
low: jamie's opening hand, bad luck<br/>
<br/>
so 6-0 is cool, i'm in the final against this james booker kid that i played in a fun game before the tourney started (and he wrecked my 56-card non-classic profit with mkos). im tryin to cut him a deal so that i can leave early cuz i got my girlfriend's graduation party or something to go to and then i gotta work after that and i got a 2 hour+ drive comin up but we cant work anything out so we'll have to play. oh well i dont need a girlfriend or a job anyway.<br/>
and it turns out booker has two ratings also: one 1892 and the other 1519. what's up with ohio players and multiple ratings?<br/>
<br/>
FC GAME ONE<br/>
i choose to play light cuz i know he's playing isb. i know this because after game 1 he was being very verbose about how slow the deck was. anyway im confident in my ability to win this matchup, just not sure by how much.<br/>
so i have a decent opening hand, just no luke or all wings, but i do draw lieutenant blount AND tala 2...overkill. i start gettin guys on ships at systems, and james.....just sits there. this one dude is watching and he doesnt know how to play, and he says to james "arent you supposed to play cards to the table too?"<br/>
anyway finally james throws down the hoth dbay and the yavin dbay and puts some guys there and flips-ola. i aint too keen on losin four force to force drains so i get lt blunt to coruscant and back him up with wedge. those two ships would stay there for the rest of the game, and booker's objective would never flip.<br/>
i do the strike planning--&gt;rieekan--&gt;romas lock thing and get all my systems out pronto. i flip pretty early this game too so i can cut back on the damage im taking as i cant find undercover spies to stop his ground drains.<br/>
<br/>
so then this weird thing happens...i know booker has seen parts of some of my games, and so it's a *possibility* that he knows what my hidden base was (bothawui) during those games...however, what he DOESN'T know is that i'm playing two copies of aquaris so that i can switch hb indicators between games if i deem it necessary. and i HAVE dempt it necessary for this game. so he puts ships down at two different systems (one being bothawui, which was my base throughout the tournament). then he probes at bothawui. i'm like "nope" and he makes this little grunt noise like he doesn't believe me. so then he throws a card under the other system (kashyyyk) and im like "nope." so then he grunts again and turns in his chair and calls for the judge to verify what my hidden base is.<br/>
<br/>
so i get pretty angry cuz the way i see it, he's implicitly accusing me of lying AND cheating. so the TD comes over, gets a glance at my indicator, and nods his approval. and i give this booker kid a few choice words to express how im feelin about his actions. so im a total d1ck towards him for the rest of this game and the next.<br/>
<br/>
anyway the rest of this game went a lot like my game with brad except james is not playing with imperial domination. i was seeing red most of the time so i dont really remember the details of the game except he probed correctly on the next turn and had a pretty decent space fleet so i did take some drains in space. and i couldnt for the life of me find tk422 or boussh which would have helped tremendously. luke did his retrieval thing and i drained this sucker out for the FW by 9<br/>
then i count my cards remaining and start to put things away and he's like "how much you win by" and i was like "9" and he was like "i thought it was 8" and i was like "i just counted them in front of your face you cheating phaggot" and matt scott had been sitting there watching the whole thing (unlike the TD who prolly should have been) so he was like "yeah it was 9"<br/>
<br/>
good: at the start of the game, booker said "isb wins all untimed games" hahaaa<br/>
bad: this kid being a total schmuck<br/>
<br/>
FC GAME TWO (im still in be-a-d1ck mode)<br/>
my deal his speeders<br/>
he starts scrambled tranny v, menace fades, and strike planning<br/>
i pull my ket maliss guys and set up dark deal and s&amp;d second turn...he gets some speeders out and uses rieekan to get haven so he can put a bunch of xwings that he organized attacked for at the hoth system for free so menace fades is in effect. luke didnt come out till turn 3 i think so he keeps losing to s&amp;d.<br/>
i never got the system set up or occupation going this game but i didnt need it. what i DID need was my friggin ice plains so i could take menace fades out of the equation and keep s&amp;d running. i also had arica and vader in hand to pay a visit to the warroom if/when the shield was lowered, but i never saw a romas lock or a trooper officer all game.<br/>
so it was a matter of me finding the ice plains, which took me about 3 turns. i lost a good deal to drains and direct damage during that time of course, but he couldnt touch me on cloud city (he came with epp obi and i ended that pretty quick). regis stole some speeders which helped me on the damage tip. once i dropped the ice plains menace fades kicked out and dark deal and chybc shield kicked in, and the drains crushed him. i never saw battle plan either as he wasnt playing with a starting effect. i could have drawn up when i had him low on life force but i figured, just for this guy being such an ass, ill finish him off proper.<br/>
FW by i dont remember how many cuz i scooped and got as far away as i could as fast as i could<br/>
<br/>
good: WIN<br/>
bad: opponent. sucks to end such a good tourney on such a sour note.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****WRAP-UP*****<br/>
(if youre still awake)<br/>
so the 2003 OH state champ is from PA. huge. i double-check with the TD to make sure he had all my info set and he gives me my prize support and it's.....two packs of tatooine. meanwhile EVERYONE else got a tourney foil of some sort, and packs of reflections 2. he's like "sorry dude, i had 12 foils and 13 players. and you get the uncut sheet so..." i can kinda see his point but two packs of tatooine for winning a state tournament? OUCH. on my way out i give the packs to james booker, i hope you pulled something good dude hahaaaa<br/>
