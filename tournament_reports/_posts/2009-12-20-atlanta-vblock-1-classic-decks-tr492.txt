<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Here's a long report from Atlanta's last tournament on 12/19/2009.  It was a closed format.  The rules were:<br>
<br>
1.  Classic - no maintenance or episode 1.<br>
2.  VBlock 1 Only - No v-cards except the ones in block 1.<br>
3.  WYS is banned!<br>
4.  Substituted battle destinies do not count toward battle destiny limits.<br>
<br>
So this was the first Block tournament that has ever been done!  <br>
<br>
I'm going to post 4 decks that I made for this event.  2 were used by 'Macgyver' who I was helping out since he is in med school and really didn't have time to build decks.  The next 2 were the decks I used.  Then I'll describe my 4 games so you can see how the decks played.<br>

<br/>
Both Tantive IV v and IL-19 v could be extremely good in this format, and there is no better deck to use them in than trm, so I just had to figure out a way to get out twixes reliably for this deck to be good.  So I came up with this, which ended up being similar to one Reid Smith posted on the PC Deck Forum.  Its very easy to get out all your twixes with hdwgitm, and then afterwards you get to abuse anh r2 for extra activation and card draw (don't forget!).<br/>
<br/>
Your third starting effect should normally be dodn/wa, unless you are reasonably sure that your opponent isn't playing sense (to sense your hdwgitm).  Otherwise you can start bp/dtf for extra choke.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are the cards I would take out of the deck if I were to built it for this format again:<br/>
Revo x2 (just not as good in this format with mob points and sycfa being so good)<br/>
either Launching the Assault or Rendezvous Point (whoops? lol)<br/>
For Luck (v) (I dunno, maybe Nick got it working.  It was just an experiment)<br/>
<br/>
I think this could be the top light deck in the format because it is so strong naturally.  It gives no force icons, chokes with goo nee tay, is lightning fast, and gets to abuse il19 v and tantive iv v.<br/>

<br/>
It was hard not to notice all the help that BHBM gets in this format, probably making it the top dark mains platform.  Since you can't play Don't Do That Again, Mob Points cannot be suspended, giving you solid force generation from just the cards you can pull.  Its just a fairly standard bhbm deck.  Some of the tech cards are:<br/>
IT-O v - drain +2 once you take Luke.<br/>
Come With Me v - pick Vader back up into your hand to redeploy him where Luke is to steal Luke.<br/>
Reegesk v - since you will probably be stacking some characters with the Emperor, you have a safe place to put this guy to steal cards from your opponent's lost pile.<br/>
Restraining Bolt - needed to help vrs how strong IL-19 is in this format.  One thing you can do with it is, if light puts Luke at your Throne Room with IL-19, expecting you to have to play Vader there where he will be useless to take Luke, you just make it not be a battleground and then light is screwed, losing 3 a turn until they manage to get luke off the death star 2.<br/>
<br/>
If I was to build this again for this format, I'd really consider playing Mos Eisley and starting Look Sir Droids v.  Then also the other guy who played bhbm actually used capture Fett to try to abuse it-o v, which could be a great way to go.  Also it probably needs another grabber, and I don't think Justice (v) is really necessary with WYS banned so maybe it should come out.<br/>

This deck is based on the old deck E B Ghetto by TJ Holman (posted on his dt page).  I somehow ran across that deck, that I'd never seen or heard of before, when searching for cool deck ideas for this tournament.  I really wasn't looking for a good deck, just something fun and different than what we can still play in normal constructed.  Well Ishi Tibs really fit the bill!  I thought, "Hey, it would be cool to go 1-1 or 0-2 with Ishi Tibs!"  Little did I know that the deck was actually quite a monster in this format!  <br/>
<br/>
The first benefit to playing this deck is that everyone thought I was playing some type of swarm space with very little ground.  Obviously though, this deck probably has more ground than space.  The second benefit to playing the deck is that its incredibly easy to find whatever card that you are looking for.  ANSB pulls so many cards and then using Ishi Tib 3 times every turn makes it so you get whatever you need, including matching sabers quickly without Sai'torr (v).  I never had a problem getting a saber quickly to use when I needed it (also Weapon Lev can pull a saber).<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with the deck is that its somewhat slow.  Really though, that translates into your opponent not knowing what you are playing for a around 3 turns of the game, leading them to possibly make more mistakes against you.  The slowness was not a real negative factor for me, even in playtest games, because once the deck finally does come out to fight, it does so with the strongest characters and ships in this format with their best support cards.  Check this out:<br/>
Home One with Ackbar + Haash'n = power 17, immune less than 10 and lat damage for 12 force (or 8 if you use the home one war room text by putting Ackbar there).<br/>
Obi (v) = immune &lt; 8 with a dark jedi!<br/>
Luke JK = immune &lt; 7 when alone with his saber.<br/>
Those stats are absolutely huge in this format, especially backed up with the battling interrupts and sense/alter.<br/>
<br/>
Let me go over some card choices:<br/>
-2nd hoth war room + eb garrison = these are useless cards, BUT they translate into 2 extra activation every turn.  After your second turn, you just use ANSB to pull these every turn and put them back with your Ishi Tibs, netting you 2 extra drawn cards every turn.  Huge!<br/>
-Yoxgit = Maybe one of your jedi + sabers actually dies?  Then you can use AJR to take him back to hand and then Yoxgit to get their saber back!<br/>
-Figrin D'an = heck ya!  This decks destiny is huge and he has a safe place under the shields.<br/>
-Anakin's Saber = more versatile than Luke's since you can play it on Leia when needed (like the BHBM matchup).<br/>
-YISYW/SA = This is +1 generation and pulls Honor or Launching the Assault to pull Home One.<br/>
-Grappling Hook = I probably should play WYTTPOU? instead of this.<br/>
-Balanced Attack = pulls Ackbar and Obi.  A very good card for this deck.<br/>
-OOC/tt = I don't know if you need this or not.  I figured maybe someone would bring HDADTJ and it could be useful.  Someone did bring HDADTJ but I didn't play against it, so this might be a wasted card.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing that is huge in this deck is the large amount of retrieval that it has.  Because it is so easy to track in this, you can make great use of On the Edge and also Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes retrieval.  You can also fairly easily combine On the Edge with Nar Shadda or Figrin in order to retrieve more than once in the game with your On the Edge.  Then of course Yoxgit can get you a saber back every turn.  <br/>
<br/>
This deck was so fun and effective that I want to try to make a version of it for standard constructed.  Who knows, it could surprise me like this one did!  <br/>

<br/>
I kept thinking of great light side decks when I was considering this tournament format, but dark decks were troublesome because of how good IL19 and Tantive IV v are.  So finally I just settled on playing a deck that might not be as good but also wouldn't be weak to those 2 cards and also to TRM, which I expected to be the best deck.  After just a short while though, I realized that this was a very strong dark deck since it can do an incredible amount of damage.  And it doesn't hurt that you start with the free Devastator!<br/>
<br/>
This is an easy deck to play.  You just play your first turns by stacking characters on the Devastator and putting some extra ships there.  Then when you have sufficient defense in your hand (or not, depending on how ballsy you want to play it), you just shuttle your people down/deploy more people to your sites, flip, and threaten to drain and direct damage for ~10 a turn.  Imp Command pulls Piett.  Piett can pull your AO or Praji (v) if you already have it.  Your AO causes more damage and gets your characters out cheaper.  Praji (v) pulls characters.  Desanne shuttles your characters from Tatooine for free.  Unfortunately, I never set that up since the Devastator (v) can only take 6 pilots (no passengers), so maybe its better to go with non-v Devastator.<br/>
<br/>
Space is so huge in this deck.  Darth Vader (v) is crazy in this format, especially with his black homies.  -4 to battle destiny will win any space fight.  So you can put those guys at Tatooine and move the Devastator somewhere else (with strong pilots like Thrawn on board to wreck light space) or just put them somewhere else to take over light's system.  Also you've got Black 2 (v) to cancel AWRI/DS, which is a top card for light space in this format.<br/>
<br/>
For ground, remember you can cancel your own sandwhirl with control and redeploy it elsewhere if you need to.  The Operational As Planned need to be in there to stop Frozen Assets and Grimtaash from ruining your day (both can stop your ghhhk and set light up for a game winning beat).  <br/>
<br/>
Light side had better pack Controls if they need to fight this on the ground (and they won't be beating it at Tatooine, thats for sure).  Fortunately for me, the one deck I played that had controls (3 of them) didn't draw them!  Lucky I guess...<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My IE vrs Phillip Gladney's QMC<br/>
Despite the above IE decklist, I wasn't playing the combo IAO.  I had lent my only one to another person's dark deck.  In doing so, I was banking on not running into a heavy retrieval deck, which sure enough I did first game.  It took me a while to get the right cards I needed to spread on ground, so I spent the first ~3 turns piling up at Tatooine.  I really deployed too much there.  Phillip flipped his objective and put Obi Kenobi (v) + saber + 2-1b on a lift tube that could react around all his interior CC sites.  So I finally flip and start doing 11 damage a turn to him, to which he responds by putting one person at every CC site and pucumir thryss out (although not quickly enough) and we have a full blown drain race.  He is doing 5 damage a turn and retrieving 5 a turn (for free!) while I am doing 11 damage a turn.  Unfortunately, like I said, I had overdeployed so it was close.  I had to move the loaded Devastator over to Bespin and also put Darth Vader v + custom tie to cloud city (he had no ships there so extra drain of 2) to finish him off.  FW +9.  If he had gotten out pucumir earlier it could have been a FL -9!<br/>
Good: The deck worked like it should?  <br/>
Bad: An unexpected matchup.  Secret Plans would have made this a much easier win.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My EB Ghetto vrs Nick Culpepper's BHBM<br/>
So I had an advantage right off the bat here, knowing his deck, but I don't think I really took advantage of that.  I got off to a slow start only getting 2 ishi tibs in the first 2 turns.  I did get out Figrin soon enough to "flip" EBO though.  Nick went down quickly with emperor + sim aloo to a docking bay, followed up by EPP Vader the next turn.  He also played Bad Feeling Have I on me, and had started TINT/OE (huh?! why?? who plays SAC in ebo?).  So I was able to play Luke from my reserve for 8 with his saber (from hand) to the 4th marker.  That set him back some because he had to draw cards to find an effect puller or his Come With Me (v) to take Vader back up into his hand to redeploy and take Luke.  Also he got out IT-O v quickly.  His first turn of drawing he got his Come With Me (v), afterwhich I played Obi (v) + IL-19 to his throne room.  This is why I say that I don't think I was really taking advantage of knowing his deck, because knowing that he played Restraining Bolt, this was probably just a dumb move.  Anyways, it allowed him to make a blow out play.  All in one turn he dropped a 2nd bg docking bay with Mara + saber + Reegesk (v) and EPP Vader on Luke (taking Luke) + Dr E combo.  Hmm actually he might have had Mara with Emperor and just moved her over to the other dbay...  Whatever.  And then he played Restraining Bolt, so I was no longer at a bg site, and Search and Destroy.  Now my best character (Luke) is captured with IT-O v on the table and my 2nd best character is stuck twidling his thumbs (actually, draining for 3) at the D*2 Throne Room.  So I'm losing 7 force a turn and doing 3 damage with very little ground force to stop it?  That is bad.  Also I didn't have any characters in my hand!  Maybe an Ackbar or something.  To solve this problem, what I was able to do was drain for 3 at the Throne Room, kill Obi with On the Edge, use AJR to take him back to hand, and play Obi + battle against Mara + saber + reegesk v.  Weapon Levitation took Mara's saber, and he didn't draw a 5+ battle destiny, so Obi lived and killed Mara.  Reegesk had to run away to the Emperor's docking bay the next turn.  That was a crazy sequence of events!<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere around here, I did a very dumb thing.  I had Home One War Room in hand and needed its deploy -5, but thought it was the hoth war room that I was pulling every turn with ANSB and put it into my deck with an Ishi Tib.  Whoops!  So Home One was delayed and Nick got the jump on the only system on table, Rendili, with Boba Fett in Slave 1.  I responded with Home One, but couldn't afford to put Ackbar on him.  The next turn he drains me and I lose Haash'n off the top (who Ackbar would have pulled if I could have afforded Ackbar).  When I played the ship, I battled and drew a 4 for bd, so Nick lost 5 cards instead of Boba Fett.  His next turn he played Bossk in Hound's Tooth (barrier!) and lat damage.  So I draw destiny for lat damage and get a.... 2!  Horrible!  So Home One is screwed.  Boba Fett battles and I have to lose some force (4-5) to keep home one on the table.  The next turn I am able to play Ackbar and maybe another ship like Lando in Falcon or Tantive IV v and get rid of Lat Damage.  Then he gets out Devastator (v), so we're about equal in power and he gets to bd to my one.  But this deck's space is crazy and I am finding my forfeit fodder like Wedge RSL so I take out his ships, opening up a drain of 4 for me in space and free drains with Battle Order out.  I eek out a FW +9.<br/>
Good:  This was a very fun match that I thought I had lost.  Using On the Edge to kill Obi for the win!<br/>
Bad:  Ummm, what was I thinking putting back my Home One War Room???  Also that Restraining Bolt play by Nick was sick.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My IE vrs Mike Kessling's Profit<br/>
Well I really didn't want to see Profit with my dark deck, because its really the only light deck that would play an interior Tatooine site with WYS banned (other than a random Cantina in TRM or something).  Ends up he was playing 3 controls also to help with sandwhirl.  Lucky for me (real lucky!) he didn't draw any.  He started Sai'tor v, Rycar v, and uhh I forget the 3rd effect.  Something good though!  I decided not to start Combat Response in order to be able to start both TINT/OE and Battle Order/FS.  Again, this was another match where I wish I had my IAO/SP to help counter his retrieval.  Oh well :)  I actually didn't do any damage until after he freed Han because I was just setting up some guys in space to shuttle down to the planet when I was ready to flip.  When I did flip, he had Master Luke + saber at JP and Leia RP + EPP Han at the AC.  I came down to the 4 other Tatooine sites and for protection had an Operational As Planned, reacting Blizz Scout 1 + pilot, and a barrier.  He nabruned Luke over to Mos Eisley (in the move phase) after draining.  I didn't have what I needed to kill Luke, but I did have a sandwhirl so I played it adjacent to Luke's site and ran my guy away, up to the Devastator.  I had both my AO and Occupation working here, so I was feeling pretty good.  But Luke drained for 3 (maybe I canceled w/ control?) and his objective was doing good damage.  He then came down with Obi + saber + proficiency to the Jundland Wastes and cleared me there (either I ghhhked or reacted over and then ran away the next turn).  I didn't really have anything to take out Obi either, so he got to run around my sandwhirl draining me for 3 for a while.  I tried to kill Han + Leia RP with Tempest 1 + Igar, but Igar was barriered and next turn Chewie Protector came out for 2 force and he cleared my site, losing Leia to the Bacta Tank.  Oh, somehow Han + Leia ended up at JP instead of the AC allowing me to try to kill them.  He was really wearing me down for a while and I thought I had lost, but then I was able to track a 5 to kill Obi which turned things around.  Eventually him having to pay for drains and me clearing off his big mains wore him down and it was just too much force to spend for him to keep up.  I pulled out another FW +9 (3rd in a row!).  <br/>
Good: I got lucky with him not finding any Controls early on.  Also coming back from a significant deficit.  <br/>
Bad: Getting what I thought would be a bad matchup.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My EB Ghetto vrs Jeff Anderson's SYCFA Monkey TIES<br/>
Jeff and I were the only undefeateds at this point, which Jeff was really surprised about because normally he only wins one game or so.  I have had some very difficult games against him in the past though, so I knew not to relax.  He was also playing what is probably his favorite dark deck ever - monkey ties.  On top of that, I had chosen not to play Aim High, hoping to not run into a big retrieval dark deck!  I could only find one Ishi Tib early this game, and Jeff played Lord Vader + saber to the 4th marker and then moved him into the 1st on his 2nd turn.  So I couldn't waste time trying to find Ishi Tibs and had to waste wedge rsl and melas v to flip.  Him playing Vader to Hoth though was actually very good for me, because he thought I had Ice Storm and wouldn't go to the 4th marker.  I played Honor and never lost to his drain under the shields.  Then eventually I came down with Luke JK + saber, stole his saber with Weapon Levitation, and killed Vader.  I also had Obi + saber at the Death Star docking bay, and since Vader's saber was still on the table, there really wasn't any way for him to come to ground from then on.  When I finally got Home One + Ackbar + Haash'n in space, I was draining for 9.  He did contest my space drain of 5, but he hadn't gotten out his SAC protection so I was able to sense and grab his All Power To Weapons.  FW +more than 9 :)<br/>
Good:  Him starting Battle Order and not TINT/OE<br/>
Bad:  Not much.  The game went smooth on my end, and its always good to see Jeff doing well in an event.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to post a director's report within the week with deck statistics.  It will show how different all the decks were that everyone brought.  This was a great event that I really feel I got lucky to win.  Also everyone said they wanted to do more closed format block tournaments in the future, so I encourage you to hold one of your own in your area.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing I have to mention...<br/>
--- THE BROKEN PLAY OF THE DAY ---<br/>
The craziest thing that went down in a game today luckily didn't happen against me!  Nick 'Macgyver' Culpepper abused Reegesk (v) SO badly in one of his games that he had his opponent's Gold Leader in Gold 1 (v) using a Landing Claw to attach to his opponent's Tantive IV (v).  Then on top of that he was tracking around 2 destiny 0/7 r2 in red 5s in his deck.  BROKEN!  lols :P<br/>
