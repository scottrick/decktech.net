<br>
After I won a tournament last December I only had an average performance at the A.C.T. championships in January.  I think that this is the first tournament since then.<br>
<br>
I played COTVG with capturing and feeding.  Its a deck I have worked on for ages and I'm proud of - posted now on DeckTech.  For light I played a very standard TRM, which is about the only viable LS deck right now.  I have not posted this deck because its so so similar to all the others out there.  I really hope V9 gives more viable options for LS.<br>
<br>
Sadly only four people showed up for the tournament.  But that was ok because we all got to play each other twice.<br>
<br>
On to the games <br>
<br>
Game 1:  LS vs Neil Kane (HD)<br>
<br>
Neil is a very good CCG player, proficient in SWCCG, Magic, LOTR and some others.  This was a pretty standard match-up.  Neil started IAO&amp;SP, AAA(v) and Sando after I started Wokling (v), DTF and Colo.  Neil opted not to start Mob Points.  The game went badly for him pretty early as I got a second turn Revolution on the Holotheatre and put Corran there to cancel Visage.  With no spies in his deck that I could see, Visage was gone for the whole game.  Neil continued to set up at the DSDB, getting Vader, Emperor (v) and 4-lom there.  I responded with a continuous string of EPPs.  Once I got Goo out Neil was really struggling to get characters down.  Neil put out Rendili for more force generation, but his ZiMH was countered with Home One and Artoo BLD.  He chose to lose ZiMH rather than 5 overflow.  I drained him out.<br>
<br>
Full win by 21  (2 +21)<br>
<br>
Highlights:<br>
Revolution<br>
<br>
Lowlights:<br>
A pretty standard game.  Neil was a bit unlucky, although he also made a bad mistake moving the Emperor away from the DSDB.<br>
<br>
Lessons:<br>
Huntdown should never rely only on IAO/SP and YCHF/MP for generation.<br>
Revolution is a great card!  I put in two at the last minute and wont ever play without them again.<br>
<br>
Game 2:  DS vs Paul (Hyperdrive with KDH (v))<br>
<br>
Paul likes to try different things but this was a bad matchup for him.  He started Krayt Dragon Howl (v) to put Obi (Padawan Learner) and his lightsaber at the junkyard.  I started Krayt Dragon Bones (v), Blaster Rack (v) and Colo.<br>
<br>
Game started badly for Paul and he never really recovered.  I drew DrE combo.  With 7 force to play with, I deployed them to Obis site with DrEs blaster rifle, put a 6 on the fish, battled and goodbye Obi.  Since Paul had only 3 cards in his hand I figured a return beat-down would be unlikely.  However, to play safe I pulled the DB94 and put Boba Fett there with Hermi Odle (v), holding a Stunning Leader to get out of strife.<br>
<br>
Paul picked up and activated a lot, setting up for a big beatdown, but also losing to my objective.  The beatdown never came, but instead he deployed all over Tatooine, going for a mass of drains.  Meanwhile I got the Sail Barge out and a few other characters and from there it was simply a procession to the Sarlacc Pit as I battled and captured (mainly with Boba Fett).  I think this was the order that they were eaten:  Cute Senator who looks a bit like Leia, Jar Jar, Obi, Ric Olie and Qui-Gon.  I think there was someone else too who I cant remember.  I retrieved between 4 and 6 for each eating and Paul lost about 30 force all up.  At the end I had no lost pile.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 29 (4 +50)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:<br/>
Seeing my deck work like a charm.<br/>
Feeding the Sarlacc is a blast<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:<br/>
None.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons:<br/>
Hyperdrive is almost always a bad meta choice<br/>
KDH (v) has a huge downside of only getting three cards in opening hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  LS vs Adam (Kiffix Operative weirdness)<br/>
<br/>
Adam started Combat Readiness (v) with Kiffix, Jungle, Desert and Droid Racks, Combat Response and KDB (v).  It looked weird and it was.  Adam began by deploying Naboo and then he picked up.  He did not deploy a card for 3-4 turns, and then only deployed three unpiloted Armored Attack Tanks at the desert.  Finally he put droid pilots on them.  About the same time I dropped Home One, Bright Hope and Phylo at Naboo (Phylo to stop any Maul-in-Infiltrator stuff).  Adam wisely left them alone.  I also found Threepio and Savrip.  I revolutioned the Jungle and began draining there with EPP Obi and Screaming Man-Ho.  Adam countered with three Womp Rats and Lando was eaten.<br/>
<br/>
Obi stayed, however, and my drains kept going most of the game.  Boussh was deployed to the AAT site but got sandwhirled.  Finally Adam deployed to space and we battled.  I lost cards to Savrip and he lost cards from the table untl I had him on the run.  Unfortunately for me Adam was quite indecisive most of the game and the game was timed out.  I did some late retrieving.<br/>
<br/>
Timed Win by 25 (5 +75)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  <br/>
pretty much controlling the game from turn 1.<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: <br/>
not finishing it off.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons: <br/>
Savrip is great.<br/>
Droid Racks is not that useful if you are only activating 9 force.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  DS vs Adam (MBO)<br/>
<br/>
Adam and I met again.  I had not playtested this matchup and suspected it was be a loss.  Adam started the usual MBO stuff  Strike Planning, Great Shot Kid and Combat Response.  I wondered for a while and started Colo.  It was probably the wrong choice but did not matter since I drew S&amp;D anyway.  I deployed Boba to the AC first turn plus S&amp;V.  Adam flipped first turn and I invaded with everyone I had on offer, keeping token guys on Tat to satisfy the objective.  Adam had a bit of trouble setting up but I could not work out why.  He lost a lot to S&amp;D and the objective.<br/>
<br/>
Finally he blew the Death Star and I lost the Sail Barge which meant no feeding!  Having taken the Y4 sites I drained and battled him heavily.  A few battles in space plus lots more S&amp;D damage it was a surprise (for me) win.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 16  (7 +91)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:<br/>
Winning a game I did not expect to<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:<br/>
I still think MBO is an NPE but not as much as I used to.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons:<br/>
- MBO is not an auto-loss.  In fact, I felt pretty confident about future meetings!<br/>
- Make sure you draw heaps of card before the Death Star blows  you want to at least choose the 14 cards to lose!  If I had, I would have saved the Sail Barge and been able to feed and retrieve.<br/>
- MBO is very card-intensive in setup.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  DS vs Neil (MBO)<br/>
<br/>
Much to my surprise, Neil was also playing MBO.  I had figured that people would hold off on this deck until Mon Mothma (v) was legal!  Weird.  I learned the power of S&amp;D last game in this matchup and started YCHF instead of Colo.  Who needs Colo to capture scrub rebels???  I got Colo out second turn anyway.  This game went similar to Adams, except I played more aggressively and positively since I knew I could compete.  Neil also had trouble finding the cards to blow the Death Star while I invaded Y4 and started the capture routine.  I got the Sail Barge out as well.  Neil took S&amp;D and objective damage all game, as well as the odd drain.  He did blow the Death Star but I had drawn a lot and ditched unneeded cards.  Mostly I battled and retrieved and finally fed Crix to the all powerful Sarlacc.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 15  (9 +106)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:<br/>
Proving again that I could beat MBO<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:<br/>
Deciding that MBO is not worth playing  I was planning to build one myself.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons:<br/>
- both Adam and Neil had solid MBO decks.  Getting a second or third turn blow does require a bit of luck, which Adam and Neil did not have.  It is also useful to put pressure on them  even if they are playing multiple copies of some cards, if you make them lose one or two of them there is a better chance that the other(s) will get activated or just wont turn up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I won the tournament undefeated - we did not play Round 6 because it would not have mattered.  My second tournament win!  It was a good day.<br/>
<br/>
I played Neil again TRM vs HD and beat him again even after I took a 13-card overflow beatdown.  TRM owns HD.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Paul, Neil, Adam and me for turning up.<br/>
Paul for continuing to run SWCCG tournaments<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
are messy food leftovers which you must clean up if you are a kitchen hand.<br/>
