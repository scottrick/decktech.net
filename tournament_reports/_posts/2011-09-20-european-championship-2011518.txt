<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <u><b>SWCCG European Championship</b></u><br>
-Bochum, Germany  Sept 3rd 2011<br>
<br>
Ok, first of all, sorry it took me nearly two weeks after the ECs to get around to doing this tournament report. Unfortunately, shortly after returning from Germany, my mom had to go to the hospital, so taking care of her took up a bunch of my time, leaving little focus to write up this report. Moms back home and all better now though, so its about time I get crackin!<br>
<br>
So anyway, Euro Championships 2011! Everyone from Team Copenhagen had been really looking forward to this event. Last year, only myself, Kristian rax Lund and Casper aermet69 Jørgensen went, and had an absolute blast, but this year we were bringing all 7 of us, as well as 3 of our friends from Horsens, which is a town about 165 miles from Copenhagen. That meant a total of 10 people coming from Denmark. Yeah, thats right I can do math! We knew that we had to beat the 35-player minimum to be allowed to host Worlds next year, so we felt pretty good that wed be able to contribute about 30% of the required people on our own. All in all, our roadtrip convoy consisted of 3 cards, carrying (in addition to myself, Kristian and Casper as mentioned above), Jesper NoNamium Hansen, Jon Holo Holtet, Jesper Jedi SheeP Gravesen, Tobias TB Bukkehave, Rasmus Twotak Juul, as well as Lars Jensen and Stephan Garmark whose forum handles, if they got any, I do not know.<br>
<br>
We wanted to get to Bochum as early as possible, since what makes these international tournaments the most fun, in our opinion, is the day/evening/night before the tourney itself, spent tweaking, polishing and generally readying our decks of choice for the big event, and we wanted to have as much time for that as possible. Plus of course have time to meet up with the other people going to the tournament, go out for a couple of beers or whatever fun stuff people could come up with. As the drive from Copenhagen to Bochum is about a 10-11 hour journey, pitstops along the way included, we decided to leave as early as possible, and met up at 6am, ready to head out on the open roads. As we made our way through Denmark to Horsens, where we were to meet up with Rasmus, Lars and Stephan, we managed to lose Car #2 (containing Tobias, Jon and Jesper G.) somewhere along the way. Well technically we didnt lose them, because we never actually managed to meet up with them. Apparently theyd gotten lost somewhere around Roskilde. Guys.. just get a freakin GPS next time ;) Anyway, we hooked up with the Horsens-crew at a freeway truckstop café, where we decided to break out our Star Wars cards, and get a few games going as we waited for the last car to catch up. Once we were all together again, it was pretty smooth sailing (or driving, I guess) from there to Bochum. Freeway all the way, and nothing exciting to relate, so Ill skip to the arrival at Bochum.<br>
We arrived at our hotel somewhere around 5pm, got ourselves checked in and got a change of clothes before going out for dinner with the whole Denmark crew. After dinner, a couple of us went out to buy beer to bring back to the hotel rooms, but since it was apparently some kind of holiday in Germany, most of the stores were closed, and we ended up walking around for nearly an hour I believe. When we finally managed to locate a supermarket that was open and get the goods, we headed back to the hotel, only to then realize that there was a store located about 50 yards from the hotel that sold beer. Incidentally, it was the same place wed bought our beer last year, at the 2010 ECs. Boy did we feel stupid! Oh well, it was time for deckbuilding!<br>
<br>
A bunch of the guys wanted to meet up in the hotels conference room and get some games going, but I still didnt feel totally right about my decks, so decided to stay in the room and tweak them some more. Kristian and Casper, with whom I shared the room stayed too and offered helpful input and some great tips. Deckbuilding sessions with those guys are always awesome, as we all have very different approaches to the game, so they always yield a variety of good (as well as some really bad!) ideas. Around 1am I finally decide that my decks are as good as theyre going to get, and go down to join the others in the lounge (since the conference room is about to close) for some games. Here we also run into Dennis Hes and Frans Zwiers from the Netherlands, whore also staying in our hotel, and are awesome enough to buy us all a round of drinks. Thanks again guys!! I think its Rasmus who gets into a game against Frans, whos playing some kind of Ewok TIGIH deck, and apparently squashes Rasmus Vader with an Ewok Spear to the chest and a mass of overflow damage. Tobias saw it, and commented something along the line of if he plays that crap tomorrow against me, and I get killed by  a bunch of stupid teddybears and a pelican, Im gonna go f*cking nuts! No idea where the pelican entered the picture, but the quote was hilarious at the time, and Im just sorry that I dont recall the exact wording. Oh well, guess you should have been there :) Most of us retire to our rooms and get a few hours of sleep, while Rasmus, Lars, Dennis and Frans stay at the lounge til like 5am, downing beers!<br>
<br>
Next morning, we meet up 9:30 to make our way to the Zu Den Vier Winden pub, where the event is held again this year. By we, I mean most of us Rasmus and Lars are impossible to get outta bed, and we end up deciding to go on ahead, and just hope theyll get up in time to not miss the tourney. Stopping only to grab some breakfast along the way, we arrive at the venue.. and find Rasmus and Lars already sitting there, filling out their decklists. How the F did that happen?! Did we pass through some sort of space/time-continuum rift or something on our way to the pub? Well, never mind. Were just glad everyone made it and didnt have to miss the main event. We all get our decklists filled out and handed in along with our registration fee, Chris Menzel welcomes everyone with the great news that we made the 35-player cut, and my a nice margin as well, as were 40 registered players for this years European Championship tournament. Like at the Year Starter event (aka the James Paul Booker Honorary Tournament) in Berlin, Team Copenhagen have decided to put another bounty on our heads. Even though the ECs will use Strength of Schedule, I therefore urge everyone who scores a win against either of us to count their remaining force, because the first one to get a win with a differential of 30 or more, will receive a Darth Sidious card! With that outta the way, its on to the tourney itself<br>
<br>
<b><u>Game 1: Hunt Down (v) vs. Frans Zwiers TIGIH Ewoks</u></b><br>
<br>
My very first game of the tournament is against the dreaded Ewoks from last night! At least having heard a bit about the deck in advance gives me a clue on what to stay alert for.. namely Ewok Speaks penetrating Vaders cybernetic armor  Frans starts There Is Good In Him, I Feel The Conflict, Endor: Chief Chirpas Hut (with Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) and Lukes Lightsaber there) and Endor: Landing Platform, then plays Heading For The Medical Frigate to deploy I Hope Shes Alright (v), Ewok Celebration and Saitorr Kal Fas (v). I deploy Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi (v), Coruscant (SE), Coruscant: Imperial City and A Siths Plans, then play Prepared Defenses for Gift Of The Master, Ni Chuba Na? (v) and Combat Response (v).<br>
<br>
As my first action of the game, I play  Short Range Fighters &amp; Watch Your Back to take Saber 1 into hand, then I pull Galens Fighter with the objective, and play the Abyss and Allegations Of Corruption shields. I activate 6, use 2 to deploy Tatooine: Jabbas Palace with A Siths Plans, then use its gametext to deploy Jabbas Palace: Dungeon. I get out Blaster Rack (v) with Gift Of The Master and drop Kashyyyk from hand, then draw 3, leave 1 force and pass the turn to Frans. <br>
<br>
Frans uses Rebel Leadership (v) to deploy the Home One: War Room, and I decide to save my grabber until I know a little more about his deck. Frans didnt drain me at the hut, so Im thinking I probably pulled Battle Order as well, but I dont have it in my notes. He then pulls Endor: Ewok Village (v) with I Hope Shes Alright (v), deploy Chief Chirpa (v) and an Ewok Tribesman to the hut, and end his turn. Might have drawn a few cards as well, I dont recall. <br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I drop Baron Soontir Fel in Saber 1 to Kashyyyk, and equip it with the SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons, pull the Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber with Jabbas Palace and then draw some cards and end my turn. Frans pulls some more teddybears into hand but doesnt make any move yet, and is still just stacked at the Hut. On my turn, I drain for 2 at Kashyyyk, drop Galen with his saber to Audience Chamber, and Black Leader in Galens Fighter to backup the Baron on Kashyyyk. At this point, Im thinking Frans main character selection is Ewoks, and they all have a deployment restriction of only deploying to Endor, so I am confident that Galen can hold the site on his own for the time being, and feel that backing up space is the better choice, in case hes running the Home 1 package, or Han, Chewie and the Falcon, which I believe he lost one of on my drain this turn. Frans gets the turn, and drops an Ewok Catapult and a Spearman (I think) to the Ewok Village, then move everyone except Luke over from the hut, leaving Luke alone. <br/>
<br/>
On my next turn, I drain for 2 at Kashyyyk and 1 at the Audience Chamber, and I believe Frans loses an Admiral Ackbar, making me feel a bit safer at the system as well, even if he should drop Home 1 there. I consider playing the Come Here You Big Coward shield, to prevent him from retrieving with Lukes while alone on Endor gametext on his next turn, but decide that it can wait til later in the turn. I then use my Audience Chambers gametext to deploy Arica (v) from Reserve Deck, get her Saber with Blaster Rack (v), and deploy Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Baba to Tatooine: Jabbas Palace. Frans asks me to wait as he might have a response to my deployment of the doctor combo, and Im wondering what that might be. After a few moments of thought, he plays Noble Sacrifice on Luke! I did not see that one coming. And since I neglected to get my Coward shield out when I thought about it, he gets to retrieve 7 Force, which is his entire lost pile at this point. Doh, there goes my headstart. I still have the better board position though, and a bunch of cards in hand, so I still feel Im coming out ahead, if were to turn this into a drain race. Him being restricted to Endor, and me being determined to stay the hell away from his insane teddybear parade, that might very well be where this game is heading. I move Arica over to join Evazan/Baba at Jabbas Palace, and end my turn. Frans moves some stuff around and draws more cards. I just drain and draw. Frans drops an Endor site (I forgot which one) between Landing Platform and Ewok Village, and puts Mace Windu (v) and Jedi Lightsaber (v) there, flipping me back to the 0-side. Hes all alone at the site though, so I figure that if I want to clear him, its gotta be now, before he gets backup from some non-unique Ewoks (which are all heroic, due to Ewok Village (v)). I drop Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and his saber on Mace, but he gets immediately Clash of Sabered. In Frans next control phase, he first announces a Nabrun Leids, transporting most of his Ewoks from the Village to Maces site, but then asks if he can take it back (destiny hasnt been drawn yet), and Im fine with that. He then decides to play Sorry About The Mess &amp; Blaster Proficiency, trying to cut down Vader with Mace, but I play Force Field (v) to cancel the targeting. He then proceeds with the original plan and Nabruns his teddybear brigade over. Id be sweating a bit here, if Vader wasnt still Clashed. Apparently though, Frans fails to realize this, and initiates battle, to which I reply that Vader becomes immediately excluded, ending the battle. Frans curses himself for overlooking that, wasting his Nabrun and gaining nothing. He then moves most of his Ewoks back to protect the lone Chief Chirpa at the Village. On my turn, I drain at Kashyyyk (2), Jabbas Palace (2) and Audience Chamber (1), then move the now de-Clashed Vader over to the Landing Platform. Frans gets out Graak and Kazak, adding 1 to each of his drains, and forcing me to lose from my Reserve Deck. Since I have like a 17-card hand, Im actually quite low on actual Life Force, and this could be really dangerous. However, realizing that Im in pretty much complete board control at this time, I decide to activate my entire Reserve Deck, and not use any force at all (since Im draining for free anyway). I just drain away, letting him make a move, and lose cards from hand when he drains me. This goes on for a turn or two, after which I drain him out. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Highs: Vader didnt get a spear through his chest!<br/>
Lows: Graak that teddybear needs to be set on fire, then sent to play on the freeway.<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 2: Team Copenhagen Rebel Senate vs. Dirk Friedrichs Ralltiir Operations</b></u><br/>
<br/>
Dirk starts Ralltiir Operations deploys Ralltiir system, then plays Prepared Defenses to deploy Insignificant Rebellion (v), Tarkins Bounty (v) and Endor Shield (v). I start Plead My Case To The Senate, deploying Coruscant: Galactic Senate and Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber, then play Heading For The Medical Frigate to deploy Wokling (v), Commando Training (v) and Strike Planning. With the exception of a few changes, the deck is the same that I played at the Danish Nationals, as well as in the Berlin Year Starter tournament.<br/>
<br/>
I know Dirk from previous tournaments, having met him both at last years Europeans, as well as in Berlin in January. I know hes a good player, probably one of the top players in Germany (that I know about). That coupled with the fact that RalOps can be a very strong deck makes me rather wary of having to face him already. But Im confident in my deck, having taken it to several good placements (including all the way to the top in the Danish Nationals), so Im sure that I can win it if I play well. We take turns taking a few actions before any force gets activated. I pull Senator Mon Mothma with Strike Planning, and play the Chasm and A Tragedy Has Occurred shields. Ive got 2x Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion in my starting hand, so this is looking like a good start for me. Dirk pulls his Allegations of Corruption shield, as well as a general (I believe it was Nevar?) with Endor Shield (v). He then goes on with his activation, and heads into deploy phase, where he pulls the Ralltiir: Spaceport Financial District site with his objective, drops Ni Chuba Na? (v) from hand, and draws a few cards before ending his turn. I drop Mon Mothma, Father Bail as well as Senate Hovercam (killer starting hand!) to Galactic Senate, flipping my objective and using its 7-side to grab So This Is How Liberty Dies from my Reserve Deck, and deploy that one to Senate as well. I then use Commando Training (v)s once per game may deploy a virtual block 4-effect text to pull Quick Draw (v), and use that one to pull Saitorr Kal Fas (v). Mon Mothma then uses her once-per-game text to pull the Coruscant: Nightclub, after which I draw what is left in my force pile, except for 1, and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Dirk goes to deploy a site to Ralltiir with his objective, and disbelievingly flips through his deck several times. Turns out that all 3 of his remaining sites are in his Force pile, so I get to verify his deck. Looks like a pretty standard RalOps deck to me, nothing in his Reserve at the time jumps out at me and screams surprise!!. Dirk then goes straight to his draw phase, drawing until he has 19 cards in hand. Damn, why didnt I put that Grimtaash, my 61st card, in the deck! On my turn, I activate a bunch, use Bail to tunnel vision and take Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) into hand. Then, as Tarkins Bounty (v) no longer protects his hand (it has more than 12 cards in it), I 3 Force and my objective to put 2 of them back into his Used Pile. Luke comes down to the Night Club with his Lightsaber, and then draw a couple of cards (as I saw lots of nice cards in the pile when using Bail) and play a Let The Wookiee Win (v), which Dirk promptly grabs. This suits me fine, as itll let me abuse my Blaster Deflection and other defensive cards, should he attempt to attack me in the Club with his EPPs.<br/>
<br/>
On his turn, Dirk drops all 3 of his remaining Spaceport sites to Ralltiir, then end his turn, saving about 6 Force in his Force Pile. I use Bail, then drain for 4 at the Club (+1 from Saber, +1 from So This Is How Liberty Dies). I then drop Yoda, Master of the Force (either from hand or using JCCs gametext, I dont recall) and Jedi Lightsaber (v), get him to the Club to party with Luke, then end my turn. Dirk drops Emperor Palpatine, Janus Greejatus and General Nevar to separate Ralltiir sites to flip his objective, then consolidate them all on 1 site, leaving him less vulnerable to attack, but unable to fulfill Resistance shield (which he therefore hasnt pulled either), letting me continue to drain for 4 (-1 from his objective now, but +1 from Yodas saber being added). On my turn, I do just that (drain for 4), get another card into hand with Bail, draw a few and end my turn, satisfied with my current board position, hand composition and being well ahead on Life Force remaining.<br/>
<br/>
Dirk then goes on the offensive. He declines to drain at his one site (Battle Order is out) and instead goes to deploy to the Night Club. Kir Kanos With Force Pike, Mara Jade With Lightsaber and Darth Maul With Double-Bladed Lightsaber all come to disrupt the party, and Dirk drops First Strike, which is annoying as I only have 2 Force saved, and a bunch of nice interrupts in hand. Guess Ill have to play it smart and really pick which 2 I wanna play. Maul takes a swing at Luke (paying 1 Force to do so, due to Lukes text), and I use my first Force and play Blaster Deflection. Yoda swings at Kir Kanos (who is heroic, and technically defense value 0 in the Night Club. With 3 weapon destinies, I cant possibly miss, and indeed Kir is hit. Dirk plays I Have You Now to add 2 battle destinies. Luke takes a swing at Mara, and easily hits her (+1 to each destiny, on top of the -1 defense value from the Club). Maul takes another swing at Luke, and misses. I then pull the Another Pathetic Lifeform shield, limiting him to 2 battle destinies because he has a Dark Jedi in the battle. Mara takes a swing at her future husband, but like Maul, she also misses. He draws his 2 battle destinies, getting a 4 and a 3. I dont recall what I drew. I forfeit Yoda, and pay my last Force to play A Jedis Resilience on him. Unfortunately, Dirk has a Sense in hand, and he plays it. I too have a Sense, but Im out of Force and cant pay to play it. Blast! Yoda gets to stay in the Lost Pile for now, and I take 2 overflow to keep Luke on table. Dirk loses all his characters, and Luke is left alone at the Club.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I use Bail to pick Mace Windu (v) out of my Force Pile, deploy him to the Club and get the Jedi Lightsaber (v) from my Lost Pile. I then draw a few cards and end turn.<br/>
<br/>
Dirk drops Kashyyyk and puts the Victory with Grand Admiral Thrawn piloting there. I keep draining for 4 at the Nightclub, then drop Han, Chewie and the Falcon to Kashyyyk, initiate battle (retrieving one with Dirks First Strike and causing him to lose one). I play Life Debt to add 2 battle destinies, and in the end the system is totally cleared. Dirk drops a lone Dengar In Punishing One to Kashyyyk and draws some cards. I drop the Alderaan Consular Ship with Corran Horn piloting in front of it, and put Mas Amedda in the Senate. Failing to realize that DIPO doesnt draw destiny on its own, I decline to battle, rather seeking to make sure I occupy the system to drain for free and do additional damage with Mas Amedda, I end the turn. Dirk looks puzzled and asks why I didnt battle Dengar, and I smack my forehead as I realize that Id have gotten some free overflow (or cleared the system). He gets a round of free drains (for 2, due to Janus with Emperor), then plays a lost Monnok to see whats in my hand. He sees my Spiral in hand, as well as the 2 Force I have saved, and since he didnt manage to find any additional ships to help out Dengar, he flees to Ralltiir system. On my turn, I drain 4 at the Club, 2 at Kashyyyk and cause 2 Force loss with Mas Amedda. I pass the turn, and Dirk draws up his last Force, realizing hes too low on Life Force to put up a fight at this point.<br/>
<br/>
FW (4)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Luke surviving the big battle to keep on the pressure. Keeping him from ever fulfilling Resistance.<br/>
Lows: Not having enough Force to play my interrupts when he dropped First Strike. Failing to attack Dengar.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 3: Hunt Down (v) vs. Kristian Lund's Tatooine CP(v)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Kristian starts Tatooine (Cor) then plays Careful Planning (v) to deploy Tatooine: Slave Quarters, Aim High, Merc Sunlet (v) and Rebel Gunrunner with Chewbaccas Bowcaster on it. I start the same cards as in game 1.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I already hate this match-up, for two reasons. One is the obvious one. Kristian is from my local playgroup, and I honestly didnt hope to drive umpteen hundred miles, for 11 hours, to go to Germany, and play the same dude I play every Monday night at our local gamestore. Oh well, Kristian and I usually do well at tournaments, so I guess it was kinda inevitable that wed eventually have to face eachother. The other reason is Kristians LS deck is insanely good. Its basically pre-nerf Communing, without the Communing part. It runs Aim High and I Cant Believe Hes Gone (v), places Obi-Wan in Radiant VII out of play, and then comes at you with like twelve different versions of Han, and the Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This battle-damage trippler. Ive played against it before, at our local gamenights and tourneys, and no matter how much I turtle at a site, I always seem to end up taking like 189 battle damage over the course of a game. <br/>
<br/>
At the start of the game, I play Abyss and my grabber, pull Saber 1 with the Short Range Fighters combo, and pull Galens Fighter with the objective. Kristian plays his own grabber, and takes Obi-Wan In Radiant VII into hand with We Wish To Board At Once. I pull Tatooine: Jabbas Palace with A Siths Plans, and use that to pull JP: Dungeon. Then I proceed to my draw phase, and play Why Didnt You Tell Me (v), putting a copy of Dengar With Blaster Carbine (v) at the bottom of my Used Pile to take something from Force Pile into hand. Theres not a lot of good stuff there, and I pick Mara Jades Lightsaber, since I dont want it getting stuck in my Force Pile, and I gotta save Force to deploy a couple of characters, since I know that if I put down someone on their own, theyll get squashed. I then pass the turn to Kristian, who just deploys Threepio With His Parts Showing to the Slave Quarters, draws some and ends his turn. <br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I go to deploy another JP site with Jabbas Palace, but miss my one remaining site (Audience Chamber). Kristian gets to verify, but passes on the option, since he already knows my deck from playtesting and deckbuilding the night before, so I guess he doesnt think itll net him any new info. I then use A Siths Plans to deploy Kashyyyk from Reserve, draw some more, and end my turn. Kristian deploys Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber, draws some cards and saves a bit. As you can probably tell, neither of us really wanted to make the first move here, so its turned into a waiting game, where were both kinda just trying to set up our hands to be able to handle whatever the other person does. As long as Kristian doesnt have Obi-Wan out of play, his deck isnt packing as much of a punch as it is otherwise capable of, but unfortunately, at some point Im going to have to start causing damage if I want to win, and thats when hell use Merc Sunlet (v) to place Obi-Wan out of play. Im therefore taking my time, setting up what I believe to be a force strong enough to not get beat down, once the damage starts. <br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I get the Audience Chamber out with JPs gametext, then drop Baron Soontir Fel in Saber 1, Black Leader in Galens Fighter, and Victory all to Kashyyyk. Kristian is playing Diversionary Tactics (v) in his deck, as I learned the hard way at a playtesting game. If youre unfamiliar with the card, it basically allows him to exclude one of my starships from combat by drawing a destiny &lt; 4. To ensure hell hit, hes packing Flash Of Insight (v). In the playtest game back home, I had Black Leader and Fel controlling a system, believing myself safe with 12 power and 3 battle destinies. Then one got excluded, I had 6 power and 1 battle destiny, and needless to say, I got stomped on. Ive learned my lesson and this time made sure to have 3 ships at the system. On Kristians turn, he drops Commando Training &amp; Klor Slug, then just draws and saves. <br/>
<br/>
I figure its time to make a move, and believe that my space force can hold their own, or at least not get overflown if he does come at me. I pay 3 to drain for 2 at Kashyyyk, and as expected, Kristian first loses Obi-Wan In Radiant VII from hand, then pays 1 and uses Merc Sunlet (v) to place him out of play from the Lost Pile, satisfying the rest of the loss from the drain. I drop Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith + saber and Cyborg Commander + saber to JP: Audience Chamber, then pass the turn. Now if I can just avoid getting beat up, Im sitting nicely at free drains for 4, which I can reinforce next turn. Since Kristians deck probably isnt good at controlling sites for a drain race, but is instead a very offense-based battle deck, I figure I can win if I can just turtle down and outlast his onslaught. Eventually hell run out of characters, and Ill make sure to grab his Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This, which is the main danger of his deck. Once again however, Ive underestimated his decks offensive capabilities. Youd think DVDLOTS + Grievous would be enough to at least hold a site without massive overflow. Wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I pass the turn to Kristian, and he drops Draw Their Fire, then deploys Han With Heavy Blaster Pistol, Leia With Blaster Rifle and Captain Yutani With Blaster Cannon to the Audience Chamber, and initiates battle. Hes got power 10 to my 13, so after resolving the Force loss/retrieval from Draw Their Fire, he plays Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This (since he had less power than me), and then a big shoot-out ensues. Both my guys connect with their lightsabers, and Vader chokes someone (Yutani, I think), but due to his Slug combo, they get to stay for the duration of the fight anyway. His 3 shots all miss my guys, but thats not important to Kristian, all thats important is that he fired 2+ weapons for the +5 power bonus from Aim High. He then pays 1 Force to add 5 more to his power with I Cant Believe Hes Gone (v). He draws 2 battle destinies (Leia adds 1 with Han), and gets 5+5. I draw a 4, which becomes a 5 with the +1 from Grievous gametext. He ends up with 30 power against my 18, and due to Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This, the 12 battle damage gets tripled, to 36! I forfeit Vader and Grievous (for 8 each), and peel another 20 cards to overflow. Ouch! He loses all his guys, since they were hit/choked. <br/>
<br/>
On my next turn, I just drain for 2 and draw, trying to setup some kind of comeback, with the limited resources Ive got left after that mega-beating. Kristian doesnt let up though. He drops HCF, Gold Leader In Gold 1 (v), and Red 8 (v) to Kashyyyk, then drops Flash Of Insight, revealing a destiny of 4 on top. I know he needs a 3 or less to be able to exclude one of my ships, and he uses some card to search for some other card, just to reshuffle. He does this a total of three times, and every time, I manage to cut to a destiny 4+ card. Then he finally uses Naked 3PO to take the top card into hand, revealing a destiny &lt; 4 card, and I know whats coming now. He initiates battle against my 3 ships, and plays Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This (Im power 17 to his 16), then plays Diversionary Tactics (v) and excludes Saber 1 from the battle, and finally use ICBHG(v) to add 5 to his power. We then proceed to draw battle destiny, he gets a 5 and a 4, while I get a 6 and a 3. He has power 30 to my 20. Triple the difference, thats 30 battle damage. I forfeit everything (for a total of 17), then count my remaining Life Force. I have 12 cards left in Life Force, and 3 cards in hand. I still need to take 13 battle damage. Theres nothing I can do with 2 cards left, so I just lose the rest of my Life Force.<br/>
<br/>
FL (4)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Managing to cut to a 4+ every time when he tried to use Diversionary Tactics (v).<br/>
Lows: Him managing to 3PO his way to a &lt; 4 destiny. Taking 50 battle damage in just 2 turns.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 4: Team Copenhagen Rebel Senate vs. Floris de Vries Hunt Down (v)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Floris starts the usual Hunt Down (v) cards (Coruscant, City and Siths Plans), then deploys Endor Shield (v), Breached Defenses &amp; Molator and Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans. I once again start the same as in the previous game with this deck. My opening hand has both Mon Mothma and 2x Might of the Republic, so looks like Ill be able to set up at the senate fast. However, against Hunt Down (v) Im a bit wary of this, as when I tried the same strategy against Chris Menzel at the January tournament in Berlin, he promptly dropped Galen and his saber there, and cleared out my senators with big attrition. Thanks to that game, Ive learned a bit about how to play vs. Hunt Down at least, and play a bit more carefully. Before much activation takes place, Floris pulls General Never with Endor Shield (v), grabs a Presence of the Force with We Must Accelerate Our Plans, and plays his Coward shield. I play Chasm and grabber shields, and play one of my two Might of the Republic to take Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion into hand.<br/>
<br/>
Floris pulls the 1/0 Special Edition Coruscant: Docking Bay with his IAO combo, and deploy the Endor system from hand. Due to his Endor Shield (v) and my Strike Planning however, neither of us gets any activation from the system. On my turn, I first play my second Might of the Republic to take Mas Amedda into hand. I go on to activate, then use Strike Planning to search my Reserve Deck, even though I already have Mon Mothma in hand. I dislike giving Floris this early verification, but I find it more important not to miss my later pulls this turn. After Floris verifies, I then use Commando Training (v) to pull Quick Draw (v), which in turn pulls Saitorr Kal Fas (v). I use 3 Force and Wokling (v)s once-per-game text to take Senate Hovercam into hand, play Naboo: Boss Nass Chambers from hand, draw 2 cards, and end my turn.<br/>
Floris pulls Endor: Landing Platform (Docking Bay) with IAO, then uses Siths Plans to deploy Yavin 4: Jungle. As I expected, he then drops General Nevar to Imperial City, and then ends his turn. On my next turn, I drop Mon Mothma, Father Bail and Mas Amedda to Galactic Senate, for the flip. With Mas Amedda there, Im not too worried about an early Galen. Would still be bad, but at least I wont lose Senate completely. I deploy Senate Hovercam, and use the 7-side of my objective to grab and deploy So This Is How Liberty Dies. I draw a few, and pass the turn to Floris. Floris immediately decides to attack my senate guys. Contrary to what I feared though, he doesnt come down with Galen. He comes down with Ice-Heart. He battles me, and adds a destiny to power with the Imperial City, since hes got a general (Nevar) there. He draws a 5 for power destiny and a 2 for battle destiny. I get unlucky and draw a 0 (Night Club), taking it into hand with Mon Mothmas gametext. I forfeit Mas Amedda, and Floris moves Ice-Heart over to the Jedi Council Chamber. I had 10 power (politics) to his 7 (power destiny + battle destiny), so I guess he must have taken 3 overflow that battle to keep Ice-Heart around.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, its payback time! I drop Corran Horn to the Imperial City, and then use the JCCs gametext to deploy Yoda, Master of the Force there from my Reserve Deck (and get him a saber with Saitorr). Corran battles and kills Nevar, then Yoda battles Ice-Heart. I manage to kill her, but due to Yoda only being power 3 and me not drawing a high destiny, I dont cause any overflow. Corran Horn moves to the 1/0 docking bay, and I use Yodas once-per-game text to take Control &amp; Tunnel Vision into hand from Reserve.<br/>
<br/>
Floris drops the Dominator to Endor, and deploys Grand Admiral Thrawn to the Landing Platform. He the shuttles him up to the ship, and deploys Alert My Star Destroyer on it. He asks if Ive got any response action, knowing that Ive got a Control in hand, but I figure I can always just cancel the Alert when Im ready to battle him there. He then deploys another Alert My Star Destroyer. Yes, thats right, there are now two Alert on Dominator, and I cant get rid of them both with just one Control. Smart move, but a bit card intensive, just to protect 1 ship, in my mind. On my turn, Ben Kenobi drops down at the Night Club (which hes allowed to, due to my Commando Training (v)), gets his Lightsaber, and Yoda moves over to join him there. Corran Horn moves into the Senate, after which I draw a few, and drop Battle Plan, since Floris seems a bit force choked, only activating 9, which isnt much for a mains deck. Now hell have to choose between paying to drain at Endor, or deploying some guys to mess with my ground crew. I on the other hand is activating tons, and can easily pay the 3 to drain for 5 at Night Club.<br/>
<br/>
Floris drops his Presence of the Force on my Boss Nass Chambers, then plays According To My Design used, paying 4 to deploy The Emperor from Reserve Deck (9 total, including his deploy cost). I pay to drain for 5, then drop Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) and his Lightsaber in front of Emperor. I check my destinies by searching for a political effect, and see two 2s and a 3. Not worth swinging at Emperor, but I can still clear him to attrition at least. I battle, Floris tries to zap Luke but draws a 5 and misses. We both draw battle destiny, and I clear him from the site. I consider whether to forfeit Luke (he didnt break my immunity), but end up deciding against it, figuring Ill just keep him there and drain for 3, since with the Presence, Nass Chambers is now a battleground, letting So This Is How Liberty Dies add 1 to drains there. On Floris next turn, he drops Vader to the Night Club, and deploy 2x Imperial Domination (v), then initiate battle against Ben and Yoda. However, he then realizes that Im occupying more locations than he is, and the two Dominations wont work. Good thing he caught this himself, because I wasnt aware of it! Always nice to play honest players. Vader ends up dead, I lose Yoda to cover attrition, then revive him with Ben. On my turn, I pay to drain 4 at the Night Club (at least Floris attack made me lose Yodas Lightsaber, so I didnt drain 5), and then try to drain for 3 at Boss Nass Chambers, to which Floris reminds me that the Dark Side gametext on the location says opponent may not Force drain here. Doh! I totally forgot about that, because I dont think Ive ever before had a character at that location. Guess I should have forfeited Luke after all, since hes stuck at a useless site now. Well, at least hes preventing Floris from attempting to take it again. I then drop Coruscant (SE) to convert his 2/0 system, further limiting his already limited Force activation. Floris just activates and draws. I drain again, then drop HCF to Coruscant, holding a Life Debt in hand in case Floris wants to battle it, deploy Mas Amedda to the Senate, and end my turn, paying maintenance cost for the Falcon. From this point, its just a few turns of drains and doing direct damage with Mas Amedda until I win the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW (6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating HD(v), which traditionally has been one of the worst matchups for our version of Rebel Senate.<br/>
Lows: Stranding Luke at my own Boss Nass Chambers. I really should know the text on my own cards!<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 5: Team Copenhagen Rebel Senate vs. Kristian Lunds Team Copenhagen SYCFA</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Once more, I get to face my buddy Kristian. My Rebel Senate vs. his SYCFA. Weve played this exact matchup before, at the January tournament in Berlin, and if you read my Tourney Report from that event, you know that that particular game was probably one of the best and most intense in my entire SWCCG career. At the Berlin tourney, Kristian managed to pull out a slim win by just 3 Force, mere seconds before time was called. So, this has all the markings of another intense and interesting game. Kristian starts Set Your Course For Alderaan, Death Star, Death Star: Docking Bay 327, then play Prepared Defenses to deploy Endor Shield (v), A Million Voices Crying Out, and Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (v).<br/>
<br/>
Our (Team Copenhagens) build of SYCFA is really strong, and I know right away to be very wary about going to space. The deck blows up Alderaan on its 2nd turn, then sets up in space with star destroyers backed by [ANH] and [DS2] squadrons, with All Power To Weapons. The amount of power you can get out of just 2 cards and an interrupt is amazing, and coupled with a reacting Accuser you really gotta be sure of your space force before going there. And if you dont go there, youll be outdrained and outretrieved. Anyway, on to the game itself. Before activating, Kristian pulls Admiral Motti, Battlestation Commander with Endor Shield (v), and play Abyss and Allegations of Corruption, while I do my usual stuff as well, pulling Mon Mothma and playing Chasm and A Tragedy Has Occurred. Kristian then activates, and fetches Death Star: Central Core (v) with his objective, and uses that site to deploy the Superlaser from Reserve Deck. Then he deploys Motti to the Central Core (making Death Star hyperspeed = 2), moves to orbit Alderaan and end his turn. On my first turn, I drop the Coruscant: Night Club from hand, search for Mon Mothma with Strike Planning, to check if Quick Draw (v) is in my Reserve, then use Commando Training (v) to deploy that, and use it to pull Saitorr Kal Fas (v). Yoda, Master of the Force comes down with the use of the Jedi Council Chambers gametext, and Saitorr gets him his Lightsaber. I drop So This Is How Liberty Dies from hand as well, then move Yoda over to the Night Club, and pass the turn to Kristian.<br/>
<br/>
Kristian deploys Death Star: War Room (v) with his objective, then plays Commence Primary Ignition (v) to autoblow Alderaan and flips. I play Aim High and Simple Tricks And Nonsense shields to curb his massive retrieval. Kristian then deploys Kiffex with the flipside of his objective, plays Atmospheric Assault to deploy a TIE Assault Squadron to Death Star and then drops the Devastator to Kiffex, and uses Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (v) to get a TIE Assault Squadron there as well. He then drops Tarkin Doctrine to Death Star, wanting to get in as much damage as possible, in what is sure to be a drain race, and finishes his turn by moving Motti over to the Docking Bay.<br/>
<br/>
I Force drain for 3 with Yoda, but it gets Controlled. He then plays Fanfare (v) and pulls He Is Not Ready &amp; Imperial Propaganda combo with it. Mon Mothma comes down at the Galactic Senate, Corran Horn visits the Docking Bay and wipes out Motti, to slow down his Death Star so it will take him longer to get from system to system to blow them up, and also to keep him from draining for free. I then draw a bunch and end my turn. Kristian pays to drain me for 3 at Kiffex (+1 from the objective) but I play Control &amp; Tunnel Vision to cancel it, then causes me to lose 1 Force to Tarkin Doctrine. He forgets to attempt to blow the system however, and instead proceeds to deploy Sidious to his Docking Bay, and add Tarkin, Death Star Commandant as well. He initiates battle against Corran Horn, who ends up dead, as does Tarkin. I dont take any overflow, so thats all good with me, since itll let me get Corran Horn back from Lost Pile later, if he should drop the U-3PO that I know hes running. He then deploys Endor (which wont give any of us any Force) and end his turn.<br/>
<br/>
I go ahead and drain at the Night Club again, and this time it goes through. Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion comes down to the Senate along with Mas Amedda, flipping my objective. I put Han, Chewie And The Falcon at Endor. It immediately gets He Is Not Readyed but Im holding a Life Debt so Im not too scared, Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) drops at the Docking Bay, and I initiate battle there. I swing and hit Sidious, we draw destiny, and he doesnt manage to break my immunity. Sidious dies, Luke remains. I lose 1 Force to He Is Not Ready combo, then pay 3 to maintain Falcon and end my turn. On his turn, Kristian successfully blows up Kiffex, causing me to peel 4 off the top of my Reserve Deck. He pays to drain and retrieve, cause Doctrine damage and then drops Naboo and puts the Victory there. Since Dreaded Imperial Starfleet doesnt allow him to download a squadron when he deploys a Victory-class star destroyer, I guess he wasnt keen on deploying the lone Victory in front of the Falcon, given that I have immunity and he does not. On my turn, I drain for 3 at the Night Club, 3 at the Death Star: Docking Bay, 1 at the Galactic Senate and 1 at Endor, then cause him to lose 2 Force due to Mas Ameddas gametext. I draw, lose another Force to He Is Not Ready, and maintain the falcon yet again.<br/>
<br/>
Kristian just drains, causes doctrine damage and then moves the Victory in front of HCF, and leaves 5 or 6 Force. Expecting him to be baiting an attack where he can react with Accuser and then get a squadron and play All Power To Weapons for massive power, I deploy the Alderaan Consular Ship with Senator Leia Organa on board at Endor to backup the Falcon (after draining of course), then initiate battle against the Victory. Apparently, Kristian was either making a bold bluff move, or he was hoping I didnt have any additional ships in hand. He doesnt have a react, and I end up killing the Victory and causing 7 overflow, while I lose the Falcon to cover attrition (and to get rid of the annoying pings from He Is Not Ready). Kristian strikes back at Endor, deploying Thunderflare and a squadron there, and initiate battle. I forfeit Leia from the ship, then decide to take 7 overflow to keep the ship on table for another turn, which should be enough to win me the game. The TIE Assault Squadron thats been hanging out at the Death Star all game lands at the Docking Bay in front of Luke to block that drain, and Kristian ends his turn. I drain at the Club and the Senate and cause 2 damage with Mas Amedda, then Luke battles and kills the squadron thats blocking his drain. Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel drops into the Consular Ship, I end my turn and maintain Lando. Kristian is low on Force and has to pay for drains. He drains for 2 at Naboo, which gets Imperial Atrocity (v)ed, then ends his turn, and I drain him out on my next turn.<br/>
<br/>
FW (8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Keeping him from draining for free the entire game. Deploying to space and not taking a huge beating. Kristian told me after the game that hed had the worst luck and never gotten a single All Power To Weapons into hand. <br/>
Lows: Being the one to give Kristian his first loss in this years European Championship.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 6: Hunt Down (v) vs. Tamas Papps Communing</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Ive never met Tamas before, but hes got a reputation for being a good player, and seeing as were both 4-1 at this point, I guess theres some merit to those rumors. He puts out Tatooine: Slave Quarters, the plays Communing (with Master Kenobi stacked) and deploys Commando Training &amp; Klor Slug and Were Leaving. I dont have a lot of positive experience playing against Communing, so far having taken several beatings at local game nights back home, so this is going to be.. interesting. I start my pulling Abyss and the grabber, he pulls his grabber. I activate, pull Blaster Rack (v), use A Siths Plans to get out Jabbas Palace, use JP to get out the Dungeon and play Kashyyyk from hand. I then draw 2 or 3 cards, and end the turn. Tamas deploys Shmi with the Slave Quarters gametext, and takes Naked 3PO into hand with her. He then drops Home One: War Room, drops 3PO there, and uses Kenobi to deploy the Tatooine system. On my next turn, I try to deploy the Audience Chamber with Jabbas Palace, but I miss, and Tamas gets to verify my deck. I notice that my Special Delivery (v) isnt in Reserve, and figuring that card is good against Communing, I proceed straight to my draw phase, and draw 6 or 7 until I get it into hand (I get the Audience Chamber too). Tamas deploys Tatooine: Obi-Wans Hut, draws some cards and saves some more. So far, the only non-location cards to have hit the table are Shmi and 3PO (and my Blaster Rack). I decide to get the action started, drop the Audience Chamber and deploy Cyborg Commander and Galen, both carrying their Lightsabers, there. I drop Special Delivery (v) as well, then end my turn. Lets see what kind of punch Tamas deck is packing! Exactly as expected, Tamas was waiting for me to deploy, so he could attack me there. He drops Draw Their Fire, then deploys Blind Jedi to Audience Chamber. I None Shall Pass (v) him, but it gets grabbed and then Inconsequential Barriered. Then he follows up with Han With Heavy Blaster Pistol, Wedge, Red Squadron Leader and Luke, Rebel Hero, then initiate battle. I swing and hit Luke, then try to swing at Wedge, but Tamas plays Run Luke, Run (v) to cancel the attempt. EPP Han doesnt manage to hit anything, and Luke doesnt have his gun as far as I recall. Im expecting some tricks like a Jedi Presence, but nothing happens, and at the end of battle, I lose both my characters, while he loses Blind Jedi, and tries to stack him on Communing, but I lose 1 Force to capture him with Special Delivery (v) and imprison him at the Jabbas Palace: Dungeon. Luke goes lost (since he was hit), and Han and Wedge move over to the Dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I drop Baron Soontir Fel in Saber 1 with a SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons to Kashyyyk, draw a few and save 5 for next turn. Tamas frees the Blind Jedi (pay 3 Force with the Dungeons gametext), and move him over to the Audience Chamber to flip me back to the 0-side. He then uses Master Kenobi to grab the Cantina, and deploy Yoda, Great Warrior there. Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and Galen, both with sabers, come down against Yoda and battle. Yoda gets hit, and he loses 2 Force to my objective, then as he tries to Commune Yoda, I once again use Special Delivery to imprison him. I know he can immediately free him again, but Id much rather have him on table, that stacked on Communing. I dont want him getting a 2nd stacked Jedi so he can start the deck manipulation, as well as get a bigger bang out of his Use The Force. He then places Were Leaving out of play to cancel all remaining battle damage. I draw a card or two, then end my turn. Tamas drains for 2 at the Audience Chamber, then starts some heavy thinking. Now that his Were Leaving safety net is gone, he can no longer afford to play recklessly, and have to carefully consider his next move. He ends up freeing Yoda, dropping Tantive IV (v) to my Coruscant system, moving Blind Jedi over to Tatooine: Jabbas Palace, and moving Yoda over to the Audience Chamber. On my turn, I drop Arica (v) and her Lightsaber as well as Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter to the Slave Quarters (gotta love those Lightsaber-wielding spies!), and battle Shmi. Poor Shmi doesnt even get to draw a battle destiny, and I end up overflowing Tamas for 16 Force loss, then move both Arica and Boba over to Jabbas Palace, in front of the Blind Jedi, end my turn and maintain Boba Fett.<br/>
<br/>
Tamas drops Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel to Jabbas Palace, and initiate battle against me. He wants to play Weapon Levitation to have Blind Jedi steal Mara Jades Lightsaber, but since Blind Jedis text prohibits him from carrying weapons, were not sure if he can legally do that or not. We consult Chris Menzel, who seeks advice from both DDM and Kristian Lund, and the ruling ends up being, that Blind Jedi may not initiate Weapon Levitation. I hit Lando, and after the dust settles, the site is cleared, and I imprison Blind Jedi once again. I drain for 2 at Kashyyyk and 3 in the Cantina, then deploy Black Leader in Galens Fighter to Coruscant and clear the Tantive. Tamas pays to drain at the Audience Chamber and Dungeon, frees Blind Jedi, moves him to AC and Yoda to JP, then draws a couple of cards. I drain for 3 and 2 again, then time is called and I decide to drop Grand Moff Tarkin (v) in front of Yoda to block a drain there. Tamas drains for 2 and 1 again, then initiate battle against Tarkin (retrieving one with Draw Their Fire and causing me to lose one). I forfeit Tarkin and take no further damage, he forfeits Yoda to avoid any battle damage himself. The game ends, and we count our remaining Life Force. I pull out a very narrow win, I think it was by just 1 or 2 Force.<br/>
<br/>
FW (10)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Very fun and interactive game. Probably the best I had at this tournament. Overflowing Shmi for 16 was neat too.<br/>
Lows: None really. Good game!<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 7: Team Copenhagen Rebel Senate vs. Angelo Consolis Imperial Entanglements</u></b><br/>
<br/>
In European SWCCG, theres one thing that is as certain as death and taxes. If you do well for long enough, eventually youll end up facing Angelo! Angelo is probably the best current player in Europe, although there are several who are close behind him. Thus, it is always a challenge to have to play against him. But Im ready to bring my A-game, as the Final Confrontation is still within reach, as Ive only lost 1 game so far. Angelo is the only undefeated player at this point I believe, so defeating him now would put me even on points with both him, and whichever other 5-1s would win this round.<br/>
Angelo deploys Imperial Entanglements, Tatooine (with Devastator (v) there) and Tatooine: Desert Heart. He plays Prepared Defenses to deploy Endor Shield (v), Aratech Corporation (v) and Crossfire (v). At the start of the game, he plays an Imperial Command, as well as uses both his Endor Shield (v) pulls, to take General Nevar, Admiral Piett and Admiral Motti (not sure on Motti) into hand. I play my usual two shields (Chasm and grabber) then play Let The Wookiee Win (v) and choose to take Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion, and finally take Mon Mothma into hand with Strike Planning. Angelo starts my deploying a site to Tatooine (dont recall which one), deploys Piett to Devastator and uses his text to take an Admirals Order (I believe it was Were In Attack Position Now) into hand, then ends his turn. I drop Mon Mothma and Bail for the flip, search my Reserve Deck with various cards and get out So This Is How Liberty Dies, Senate Hovercam, Quick Draw (v) and Saitorr Kal Fas (v). Then I end my turn. Angelo drops Sergeant Irol (v) in an AT-ST to the Desert Heart, and ends his turn. Mon Mothma deploys the Night Club from Reserve Deck, and a Visored Vision (v) does the same with the Coruscant system. I finish up my putting Mace Windu (v) and his Lightsaber at the Club, then end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Angelo deploys some AT-STs and pilots around Tatooine, plays the Code Clearance effect and uses Cold Feet to play a defensive shield. Motti and Nevar then deploy aboard the Devastator and he ends his turn. I drain at the Night Club, but he loses 1 Force to cancel it with Irols gametext. I then put Mas Amedda in the Senate and draw some. On his turn, Angelo deploys Blizzard 2 at one of his Tatooine sites, and deploy Tatooine Occupation. He shuttles down Motti and Never to flip his objective, Nevar goes aboard Blizzard 2 and scans my hand with his gametext.<br/>
I deploy Ben Kenobi to the Night Club, so Irol cant keep cancelling my drains there (since he cant cancel drains where I have a Rebel, due to my political effect). Angelo hits me for a bunch of drain + Occupation damage, and just draws then ends his turn. I get in a nice drain of 5 at the Night Club, then drop the Alderaan Consular Ship and Senator Leia Organa to Coruscant, keeping a Spiral in hand, in case he wants to attack me there. On his next turn, Angelo totally surprises me, and deploys about 4 Imperial Leaders (Veers, ISB Sector Commander, Emperors Reach and Grand Moff Tarkin (v), I believe) as well as 1-2 non-leaders to my Senate, and battle me. After attrition, he actually has senate majority!! (his leaders are polictics +2 due to my objective). That puts both my Mas Amedda damage and political effect out of commission for the time being. We end up battling over the senate for a few turns, meanwhile hes draining me and doing heavy damage on Tatooine. Despite the heavy damage hes doing, he only does manage to win by 4 or 5 Force, so at least I put up a good fight.<br/>
<br/>
FL (10)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Not a lot of highs this game. It was Angelos game almost from the beginning, and Im surprised that I got him so low on Life Force before he finished me off.<br/>
Lows: I battled him too much in the Senate on my turns, losing precious characters. I should have just let him battle me, so Id have senate majority for longer, thus being able to do more damage. In hindsight, this could very well have been the difference between me winning or losing, since the end difference was so small.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 8: Hunt Down (v) vs. Angelo Consolis Quiet Mining Colony</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Great. Not only do I get to meet Angelo again in my last game, hes also playing QMC. Angelo is like, Mr. QMC. He knows this deck so well, I expect this to be a real uphill struggle. But if I want any chance at the final confrontation, I have to win this. Meanwhile by fellow Team Copenhagen player, Jesper Gravesen, has to beat DDM in their match. If DDM wins, hell be 7-1, and all I can hope to get is 6-2, knocking Angelo down to 7-1 as well, and those two will go to the finals. Ok, time to kick some german/Italian butt!<br/>
<br/>
Angelo does the usual QMC start (Cloud City: Guest Quarters, Bespin, Keeping The Empire Out Forever, Squadron Assignments and Beldons Eye (v)). I play Short Range Fighters &amp; Watch Your Back to take Saber 1 into hand, pull Galens Fighter with my objective, and play Abyss and Allegations of Corruption. Angelo plays All Wings Report In &amp; Darklighter Spin and takes Artoo-Detoo in Red 5 into hand.<br/>
<br/>
I activate, then go to deploy Blaster Rack (v) from Reserve Deck, but it is in my Force Pile, and Angelo gets a first turn verify. Great I use A Siths Plans to deploy Jabbas Palace, pull Dungeon and then draw 3, getting both Blaster Rack (v) and Audience Chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Angelo uses 1 Force to deploy Bespin: Cloud City with his objective, then uses Beldons Eye (v) to deploy Harc Seff (v) and the Overseer there. He draws a few and ends his turn. On my turn, I deploy the Audience Chamber from hand, deploy the Blaster Rack (v), and then deploy Galen to Cloud City: Guest Quarters and get him his Lightsaber. Finally, I use A Siths Plans to deploy Kashyyyk from my Reserve Deck, and end my turn. Angelo uses his objective to deploy the Cloud City: West Gallery site, and drop Padmé Naberrie (v) there. Then he moves the Overseer out to Bespin and end turn. I drain for 1 at the Guest Quarters, then drop Arica (v) and saber to West Gallery and Saber 1 + Baron Soontir Fel + SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons as well as Galens Fighter + Black Leader to Bespin. I first initiate battle against Padmé, and surprisingly he doesnt have a Path of Least Resistance, Dodge or other shenanigans. Arica swings and hits. Angelo forfeits Padmé and plays Houjixm and he drew low enough battle destiny that Arica gets to stay at the site. I then initiate a battle at Bespin, but he plays Alternatives To Fighting to cancel it. End of turn.<br/>
<br/>
On his next turn, Angelo deploys the Cloud City: North Corridor, and drops Obi-Wan With Lightsaber there, then drops Leia, Rebel Princess and Leias Blaster Rifle in front of Arica. At first Im worried hes going to battle and kill Arica, but then I remember that my total ability there has been reduced to 0, since Arica isnt a non-alien. No worries, shes safe.. for now! I do remember Angelos great play at the Berlin tournament final confrontation, where he was facing off against Kryptofis Court deck, and persona replaced Rebel Princess with Princess Leia, for a surprise battle. I commented that I wasnt going to let him pull that trick on me! He flips his objective (since he finally controls 2 CC sites) and sets up Cloud City Celebration on Bespin. Then he drops Luke Skywalker (v) in R2inR5 at Bespin, and deploys Flash of Insight. I didnt know what he was searching for, but apparently the destiny on top of his Reserve (Spiral, I believe) wasnt good enough, and he ends up using various cards to search and shuffle his Reserve Deck 3-4 times. Every time I cut, the Spiral seems to wind up on top again (or at least a card of similar low destiny). He finally runs out of ways to shuffle his deck, and has to give up Bespin, flying Red 5 and the Overseer off to Kashyyyk, letting me cancel Celebration on the very turn it got deployed. Turns out later that Angelo had an X-wing Laser Cannons in hand, and was searching for a 4 so he could shoot down one of my ships. I tell him it was a good thing he didnt find a 4 and battle, because I was holding A Dark Time For The Rebellion (v) in hand, so he would have needed a 5 or better to hit.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I get to drain for free, and drain 2 at Bespin, then drain for 1 at the Guest Quarters, but he cancels that with Leia. I drop Darth Vader (v) in front of EPP Obi-Wan at the North Corridor, and get his Lightsaber. Angelo plays Path of Least Resistance to move Obi-Wan over to join Leia at the West Gallery. I play Elis Helrot, letting Vader follow  to the West Gallery as well, then play The Circle Is Now Complete to place Obi-Wan out of play, and initiate battle against Leia, now that my ability is no longer blanked there. I hit Leia with Vader, he misses with his Blaster, and we draw destiny. He loses Leia but takes no overflow I believe (Houjix probably) and I forget to make him lose 2 Force to my objective. He drew a battle destiny of 4, so I have to lose Arica to attrition. I then pass  the turn to Angelo, who drops EPP Qui-Gon at the North Corridor. In his move phase, I play Evacuate? (v) used to take Galen into hand from the Guest Quarters, and on my turn, deploy him in front of Qui-Gon and battle (after draining at Bespin, and having my drain at West Gallery cancelled by the North Corridor). Qui-Gon and Galen both end up dead, and neither play takes any overflow from the battle. On Angelos turn, he just draws a bunch to set up some kind of counter attack. I drain and move Arica over to the North Corridor. Angelo gets the turn, and time gets called. He comes down against Arica (dont recall which characters). I end up taking 5 overflow, which I take from my hand, and end up getting the timed win by 19 to 16.<br/>
<br/>
FW (12)<br/>
<br/>
That was the last round. Unfortunately (for me), DDM defeated Jesper in their matchup, so with Angelo and David being the only two players to have gone 7-1, they get to go to the Final Confrontation against eachother. Their match turned into a 5-hour marathon, and for a full description of the game itself, check out DDMs tournament report. In the end, David ends up as the winner of this years European Championship. Once again, huge congratulations to him!<br/>
<br/>
My goal as I was going in to this tournament, other than hoping to win it of course, was to place the same or better as last year. Well, last year I came in 4th place, out of 23 players. This year I finished 3rd, out of 40 players, so Id say that is a considerable improvement, and Im very satisfied with my own results. Guess if I keep on like this, next year Ill get 2nd and in 2013 Ill finally win the thing! :)<br/>

As Chris Menzel has already posted the full results of the tournament elsewhere, and this Tournament Report has dragged on for far longer than I first expected it to, I wont bore you with any of that stuff here. Thank you very much for reading. As always, I hope youve enjoyed reading this as much as Ive enjoyed writing it.<br/>
