<blockquote><font class="bfont"> For most players here in Northern CA, it was just a regular tourney,<br>
but for me it was the last chance for me to practice for the Vegas<br>
DPC.  Once again, I don’t get a decent night’s sleep before the <br>
tourney since a bunch of us college students had decided to have<br>
an "almost-end-of-the-school-year" party Friday night.  Yeah, we’ll<br>
find just about any reason to waste time and kill brain cells (kind<br>
of like SWCCG, heheh).<br>
<br>
For DS, I’m using a Hunt Down duelling using Saber and Onix TIE<br>
pilots and ships for space dominance (along with their awesome<br>
TIE cannons).  The SFS retrieval helps a little too.  I start IAO,<br>
Mob Pts, and Combat Response. LS is my tried and true EBOX w/Rogue <br>
speeders.  I wanted to playtest my EBO without playing Heading for <br>
the Medical Frigate, so I took HFTMF out and made a few other minor <br>
changes.  Its still basically the same as it is on Decktech though.<br>
<br>
So I get to Warmasters for Steve Daniel’s tourney, and Paul McKelvey<br>
is there and wants to play me.  I tell you this because this is great <br>
info for those of you playing EBO.  I play my EBO vs. his MKOS, and <br>
just get destroyed without my 3 effect start.  Maybe I’m a scrub, but<br>
just starting ANSB is dumb when the MKOS player will just put 1 alien<br>
at each JP site and pull Gailid 1st turn (maybe even Mosep too).  I <br>
lost Menace Fades off the top, and that was game.  Sure, my space<br>
drains hurt him, but Resistance would lock the game up for the MKOS<br>
player.  Just my thoughts.  So I put HFTMF back in before the tourney<br>
starts.  Now I can start Battle Plan, Menace Fades, and something <br>
else against MKOS.  Ok, now on to the games.<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS v Paul Green’s Hunt Down (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br>
<br>
I start Insight, Battle Plan, and Wise Advice.  He draws up, I lose<br>
Insight to get Honor.  I Signal for ANSB &amp; get some Echo stuff.  Now<br/>
he drops Vader to his DS DBay, deploys Exec DB &amp; CC DB.  I get EBO out<br/>
turn 2, and he drops Blizzard 2 w/Veers aboard to the North Ridge.  <br/>
Commander Luke and Hobbie hop in Rogue 4 at Hoth DBay, I save 1 force.<br/>
He pays to drain me, I react w/Rogue 4 to cancel it and flip him back.<br/>
He drops Emperor &amp; Janus to CC DB, moves Blizzard 2 to the MPG.  I <br/>
know he’s looking to get Decree going.  My turn I deploy Bacta Tank, <br/>
Rebel Fleet, and another system (Hoth, Sullust, Kiffex, and Rendili<br/>
out now), and 3 xwings at Hoth which I replace w/a squadron.  Then I<br/>
move my xwing at the Hoth DB to Hoth.<br/>
<br/>
Executor comes down next turn w/Chirneau to Hoth, but I barrier.  So<br/>
he drains for free now, and I deploy Boushh to block Janus’s drain.<br/>
I battle Executor, play Org Attack, and he plays Imp Command and just<br/>
loses 2 or 3 force rather than Chirneau.  I draw up Spiral and Hyper<br/>
Escape, so I save a few force.  His turn, he drops Zuckuss, battles,<br/>
so I react w/Spiral, then Hyper Escape away each ship to a different<br/>
system.  Then he drew up and said "oops, i forgot to move my ships."<br/>
But he had already drawn his cards, so that was that.  I drain for 11,<br/>
and he lost a lot of good stuff.  After that, he split his fleet up<br/>
and I killed Zuckuss, but he managed to keep the Executor around<br/>
until the end of the game, when I drained him out.  Decree never got<br/>
going cuz Rogue squadron showed up and covered my base.  Win by 30.<br/>
2 (+30).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Honor protecting for a large part of the game.<br/>
Worst: Couldn’t kill the Executor.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Kody Doherty’s HB mains (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br/>
<br/>
I play Imp Command to get Piett to my Exec DB, pull Wakeelmui &amp;<br/>
Merrejk.  He pulls Tatooine, Tat DB , and deploys a generic DB to <br/>
Tat.  Darth Vader goes to Tat DB, Emperor goes to generic DB.  He<br/>
TT’s Visage, then draws some on his turn.  I activate a ton, drop<br/>
Kashyyk, SFS, Saber 1 to Tatooine, and Saber 3 to Kashyyk.  Then I<br/>
deploy another Visage, Fighters Coming In, and Vader’s saber and <br/>
draw.  He drops Corran &amp; EPP Luke to the Holotheater to kill Visage.<br/>
I drain for lot (thanks to my Admiral’s Order), then move Piett &amp;<br/>
Merrejk from Exec DB to my Endor DB.  Luke can’t drain, so he drops<br/>
Capt Han in Falcon &amp; Dash in Outrider vs. Saber 1, but the Baron <br/>
calls for backup and Saber 4 deploys as a react for free with<br/>
DS-181-4 from my hand.  I draw my 2 destiny and draw high, killing<br/>
Han and Dash, but I lose Saber 4 &amp; pilot.  Falcon and Outrider <br/>
are empty now, and he moves Luke to the Med Chamber so Corran can<br/>
drain.  So its just a drain race that I’m winning (draining for <br/>
10), and that’s game.  Win by 28.  4 (+58)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Paul McKelvey’s ISB (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
Normally I start ANSB vs. ISB, but I’ve played Paul’s ISB deck<br/>
before and I start Battle Plan, Menace Fades, and Wise Advice.  His<br/>
deck is just too fast to start with anything less.  He gets an ORS<br/>
to his Y4 DB, draws.  I get ANSB in my opening hand, so I get to <br/>
draw some as well.  He drops his Tat DB, Chall, pulls an ORS using<br/>
Chall, then deploys 2 ORS to flip.  He also pulls Executor w/Mob <br/>
Pts.  I get EBO out, and drop xwings at Sullust &amp; Hoth, then move <br/>
1 to Coruscant.  Luke and Zev get in Rogue 1 and head for the Ridge.<br/>
He deploys the Flagship Executor, I barrier.  He doesn’t deploy<br/>
any pilots aboard, so I could’ve killed it if I had some xwings in<br/>
hand, but I had none.  Damn.  So I drain for 5, he drops EPP Vader<br/>
and an ORS on the Executor, battles, I Hyper Escape away.  He also<br/>
dropped 2 ATSTs with 2 ORS to battle Rogue 1, so I lose Luke to<br/>
the Bacta Tank.  Zev had goten out to drain at the 3rd marker<br/>
which Paul had deployed.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I had deployed Boushh to block his Tat DB drain, but he <br/>
transitted them away, so I had Boushh break cover to establish <br/>
Menace Fades again.  He had drains at Endor DB and Y4 DB.  I  <br/>
drain with Zev, but he went off thinking with his stomach &amp;<br/>
went missing.  So I get Luke from Bacta Tank, and deploy Hobbie in<br/>
Rogue 2 to the 3rd marker (Rogue 2 adds 2 to search destiny).  I<br/>
have another Hyper Escape in hand, so I move an xwing in front of<br/>
Executor.  He drains, battles, and plays Ghhhk combo to kill my<br/>
Escape.  That’s game right there (I have no Houjix in hand).  <br/>
Dumb, I know, but it was just out of habit I did that.  So the<br/>
xwing takes it up the thrusters and says thank you sir may I <br/>
please have another (he draws a 6, I lose like 15 force).  <br/>
I block a few more drains and drain a bit in space, but he gets <br/>
Decree going and I’m low on life force to be able to use Bacta <br/>
Tank to its fullest.  Not pretty at all.  Lose by 16.  4 (+42).<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really.<br/>
Worst: Ghhhk combo, of course!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Kyle Ishimaru’s WYS (Staging, Squassin, ????)<br/>
<br/>
DLOTS hits the Tat DB 1st turn, he plays Tunnel Vision, then drops<br/>
EPP Han to Cantina.  Vader moves over, I draw some.  Wedge goes to<br/>
the Tat DB to flip WYS, then 2 RFCs hit the Cantina to battle<br/>
Vader.  I choke one, kill the other RFC w/attrition, lose Vader.<br/>
Now I couldn’t draw another Vader for the life of me, so Mara <br/>
hits the Cantina w/saber to kill Han, but he plays Slight Weapons<br/>
Malfunction to get a destiny and kills Mara.  He draws, I deploy<br/>
Emperor to Endor DB and Saber 1 w/Piett and SFS cannons to Endor.<br/>
He drops ECC Lando, RFC, &amp; Gold Squad 1 to Endor DB, battles, <br/>
plays the bad feeling card that doubles battle damage, and hits<br/>
the Emp by playing Blaster Prof combo, so I lose 4, doubled to<br/>
make it 8 damage.  But after that Vader hit the Cantina, I <br/>
dropped some TIEs to Tatooine (Saber 2 and 3 w/pilots), and it<br/>
was looking good for me. <br/>
<br/>
I made a mistake by landing several TIEs and<br/>
pilots at the Endor DB to block the drain by ECC Lando and the <br/>
RFC, but he drew 3 destinies and killed a bunch of stuff so I<br/>
let him have the drain of 1.  He moves EPP Luke to the Cantina<br/>
to block Vader’s drain, and I consider duelling but I remember<br/>
he has Run Luke Run in lost pile so forget it.  So I battle<br/>
instead, Luke misses the swing and draws low so Vader lives and<br/>
the drains and Visage finish off Kyle.  Win by 6.  6 (+48).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Controlling space, he never deployed to space.  Too busy<br/>
beating up my ground troops I guess.  <br/>
Worst: Being dumb and landing my weak pilots and TIEs vs the<br/>
smugglers.  At least since he didn’t deploy to space I didn’t<br/>
need all those ships anyways.  I deployed a lot in this game.<br/>
<br/>
I get to watch one of the coolest games I’ve ever seen after I <br/>
beat Kyle.  Tim Green was playing CPI (not SYCFA) and was getting<br/>
worked by a good WYS deck, poor Tim only had 7 force to the other<br/>
guy’s 28 or so.  But Tim had the DS orbitting Tatooine, plays CPI<br/>
and bye-bye Tatooine &amp; all this guy’s locations are off the table.<br/>
But he’s still got ships at the DS draining, so Tim locks it down<br/>
by playing CHYBC, and then Ability, Ability, Ability.  Thats game<br/>
even though the other guy still has 28 force cuz he only activates<br/>
1 force now (from himself), and dies to AAA.  What a game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v Philip Green’s Hunt Down (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
Phil had just come off a big win over Ohmy Fasudhani, the 2nd<br/>
highest rated player in Alderaan (behind only Kevin Shannon), &amp; I<br/>
had never played Phil before so I knew it’d be a good game.  I<br/>
start Insight, Wise Advice, &amp; Battle Plan.  He activates and plays<br/>
a lost Monnok on me 1st turn, getting nothing at all, but then<br/>
plays No Escape to pick it back up.  So I won’t be fetching Honor<br/>
this game.  I signal for ANSB and do my thing, he just draws like<br/>
a madman (looking for Vader, I presume).  He draws up to 17 and<br/>
stops so I Grimtaash him back down to 8.  Vader, Tarkin, &amp; Blizzard<br/>
2 hit the North Ridge (Vader outside).  EBO is up and running now<br/>
so I deploy some xwings around the systems (he had deployed Rendili)<br/>
and draw.  He deploys Dr. E/Ponda combo aboard Blizzard 2 and moves<br/>
them all to the MPG.  I realize he’s going straight for my throat,<br/>
he wants to cancel EBO!  Vader &amp; Tarkin move to the DB to satisfy<br/>
Decree.  Zev in Rogue 2 deploys to Blizzard 2 and kills Dr. E, but<br/>
he draws a 6 so Zev and Rogue 2 die (Zev to Tank).  I also drop<br/>
Boushh to the Holotheater to cancel Visage and move her to Exec DB.<br/>
I also deploy Yarna.<br/>
<br/>
He’s activating a lot, so he pays to drain me and moves Vader &amp; <br/>
Tarkin to the War room.  I realize he can cancel EBO next turn, so<br/>
I Signal for Ice Storm and play it, hoping he has no more vehicles.<br/>
He doesn’t, so he can’t get guys under the Shield to occupy that 4th<br/>
and 5th site, and I’m safe, although Decree is still in effect.  He <br/>
drops Zuckuss on a lone xwing, draws a 6 but the xwing covers since <br/>
it is power 6, forfeit 4.  I then kill Zuckuss later on and move<br/>
Boushh to his CC DB, all the while cancelling his drains w/Rebel <br/>
Fleet.  Although Decree stays in effect the whole game, he can’t seem<br/>
to find any ships and loses to my measly drains.  Win by 14.<br/>
8 (+62).<br/>
<br/>
Best: The Grimtaash early on sent his Bossk in bus, Chimaera, &amp; Adm.<br/>
Thrawn to his used pile, and he couldn’t draw them until too late.<br/>
Worst: I should have gotten Honor out anyway to stop those drains<br/>
under the shield.  Dumb.  Oh well, Rebel Fleet took care of most of<br/>
them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS v Chris Green’s HB mains (Insur, Squassin, Strike Plan)<br/>
<br/>
I get a janky opening hand and just deploy Wakeelmui and Exec DB and <br/>
draw.  He pulls Dagobah, Yoda’s Pad, &amp; CC DB.  I deploy Lord Vader &amp;<br/>
Chirneau to Exec DB, transit Vader to CC DB.  EPP Obi hits CC DB and<br/>
battles, we kill each other.  He also deploys Endor.  I deploy DLOTS<br/>
to CC DB, deploy Sullust, and draw.  He draws, &amp; I deploy Saber 3 <br/>
w/pilot to Sullust, and the Emp’s Sword with it (SFS on table).  Now<br/>
he drops the Back Door w/General Kenobi there, so I have to go pull<br/>
my Endor DB (which I haven’t pulled yet cuz I know Chris plays it)<br/>
and transit Vader there.  I also deploy Jendon in Onix 1 to Endor, <br/>
Emperor to the CC DB, and save 5 force.  He drops Falcon, Capt. Han,<br/>
&amp; EPP Leia to Endor, plays Frozen Assets &amp; DTF, and battles.  He <br/>
plays I Know, draws 5 good destiny and I lose Onix 1 plus 11 more.<br/>
Then he plays Legendary Starfighter.  Crap.  Oh yeah, and he <br/>
converted my Endor DB.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I deploy Dominator and Onix 2 w/Capt. Yorr to Sullust and move<br/>
them over to Endor (picking up Saber 3), move Vader to block Obi’s<br/>
drain, and move Piett and Chirneau from Exec DB to Endor DB.  Now he<br/>
deploys Dash in Outrider and battles, plays I know and I lose <br/>
everyone but Yorr &amp; Onix 2.  He loses Dash.  HOWEVER, he only has 1 <br/>
destiny in reserve (after drawing 5 against me), so I duel Obi (he<br/>
draws a 1, I draw 6 &amp; 3), he loses 9, and I flip back (Visage still<br/>
on table).  I deploy SFS cannons on Onix 2, and deploy Emp’s Shield<br/>
to back him up.  I consider battling, because I look through my <br/>
reserve and see a 6 &amp; 3, but I’ll miss the shot if I draw a 3 and <br/>
take a buttload of damage so I don’t battle (I forgot that Leia <br/>
couldn’t drain so I could’ve landed Onix 2).  Well, I lose the 3<br/>
to Legendary Fighter so I know a 6 is on top of my reserve.  But he<br/>
battles me anyway, (I TOLD you I forgot Leia can’t battle), I blow<br/>
away the Falcon to end the battle and he has no characters on the <br/>
table and I drain him out.<br/>
Win by 14.  10 (+76).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Completing the Circle with Obi.<br/>
Worst: Super Falcon beat down poor Jendon in Onix 1.<br/>
<br/>
My differential is low, so Kyle gets 1st with like 90 diff pts.  I<br/>
end up in 2nd, and Kody, Ohmy, and Philip round out the top 5 in<br/>
that order.  No tourney foils though, just packs for prizes.  I<br/>
get a R2 pack, JP, and WB Premiere.  I needed a Virago which I <br/>
pulled in the R2 pack, so that was good.  Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Steve Daniel for yet another good tourney.  Get foils next time.<br/>
Kyle Ishimaru for winning the thing, just like he wished for.<br/>
Paul McKelvey for beating me, just like he wished for.<br/>
Tim Green for blowing away Tatooine!  You are my hero!<br/>
Phil Green for beating Ohmy.  You’ve got some skills Phil.<br/>
Chris Green for yet another good game.  You’ll get your day just<br/>
like Paul and Kyle had their day against me.<br/>
Andrew Meewis for the ride to the train station.<br/>
Everyone who read this, and liked it.<br/>
The weather man, he was right about it not raining this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
The guy playing WYS against Tim Green, he tried to stall his<br/>
inevitable loss by losing his force to AAA very slowly since<br/>
there were only 5 minutes left.  Plus he was acting like he <br/>
actually had something to do with his 1 force per turn.  But <br/>
everyone there told him to hurry his @$$ up. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
