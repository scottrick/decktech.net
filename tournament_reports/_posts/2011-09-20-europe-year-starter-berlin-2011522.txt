<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <b><u>James Paul Booker Honorary Tournament</u></b><br>
-Berlin, January 2011<br>
<br>
Ok, so Team Copenhagen is all set for attending the first tournament of the new 2011 season. Attending are myself (Morten Zenith Iversen), Kristian rax Lund, Casper aermet69 Jørgensen and Jesper NoNamium Hansen. The tourney is Saturday at 11am, but weve decided to fly down on Friday, to have the evening to sit around and fine-tune our decks and bounce ideas off each other. Casper has caught an early morning flight into Berlin (and done God-knows-what to pass the time,) while Jesper, Kristian and I are flying in around 3pm. We catch a taxi from Tegel Airport to the place were staying, and sitting outside the front door, on a case of beer, waiting for us, is Casper. Awesome! Were all set to start the evening. We have some trouble getting the keys to the apartment weve rented, but finally after a few nervous moments, the owners daughter shows up and gets us settled. Oh, and by the way damn she was hot! Id probably have skipped the tourney all together to hang out with her instead, if that had been a possibility. I think the thought of 4 guys sitting in an apartment on Friday night, drinking beers and playing Star Wars cards scared her off a bit though Oh well, good thing we have our nerdy hobby to keep us occupied! :)<br>
<br>
We get our sleeping arrangements sorted out in a hurry, unpack the tons of cards weve brought, and decide to go out and grab something to eat before getting settled into Star Wars-mode. About half an hour later were back home, and start testing our decks. Jesper has come up with a very strong Set Your Course For Alderaan deck that flips and abuses the retrieval of A Million Voices Crying Out and the free squadron deployment of Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (v). Probably not a groundbreaking, never-seen-before deck concept, but nevertheless it is really hard for us to beat it in play testing, and both Jesper and I decide to play identical decks, while Kristian also plays SYCFA, but with his own modifications thrown in (especially his decision to play Sense and Alter ended up working out well for him.) Casper settles on Death Star II/TTO, so at least the Death Star (in some version) is a common theme throughout our Dark Side decks. For Light Side, Kristian has a really, really strong Rebel Senate build, that Jesper and I both decide to copy, and we each make a few changes, mostly just changing one or two cards from the original. I think Jesper put in General Calrissian, while I decided to go with Lando, Scoundrel (non-v). I also have a TRM deck that Ive been playing a bit at our latest local tourney and game nights, and I am really torn between which deck to bring. The Rebel Senate deck is strong, and I can get helpful tips from Kristian on how to play it. On the other hand, it uses a lot of tricks like Bail, Father of Rebellion to tunnel vision and set up your start, which requires a pretty good idea of how the deck is going to play out over the course of the game, so you can anticipate which cards youll need. Without actual play experience, this deck might be hard to handle, and not something to bring to a tournament. My TRM I have played some, and it usually plays pretty straight-forward. EPPs, react to whatever your opponent does, semi-strong space usual TRM stuff. For some reason, I just have a really bad gut feeling about the deck, and I remain undecided as we turn in around 2am to get some sleep.<br>
<br>
The next morning, we pack up our stuff and head over to the tournament venue. We meet all the nice folks we met at the Europeans a few months ago, and exchange all the usual greetings. Everyone is really psyched to get the new tournament year started, and we can see that were going to get the 20+ players already, thus fulfilling one of the 3 requirements to be allowed to host Worlds in 2012. Getting this big a turnout on the first tourney of the year really lifts the spirit and everyone seems sort of proud of our little European Star Wars CCG community, which seems to be constantly growing. We fill out our decklists, and like 10 minutes before start time, I finally decide on my Light Side deck, and go with the Rebel Senate.<br>
<br>
Gregor Karbstein, our awesome TD, hosting his first ever tournament, and doing an excellent job at it, makes all the initial announcements, then prepares to set up first round pairings. In the meantime, I get up and inform everyone about the Bounty that Team Copenhagen has put out, on ourselves, for those who didnt catch it on the forums before going to Germany. Basically, the first player to defeat either me or one of my three teammates, during tournament play, by a differential of 25 or more, gets a Darth Maul With Lightsaber card. People seem to love the idea, and as the tourney progresses, were asked again and again by random people, whether the bounty has been claimed yet. An added element of fun, which I am sure well repeat again at a later tournament.<br>
<br>
And now, on to some Star Wars!<br>
<br>
<b><u>Game 1: LS (Rebel Senate) vs. Julian Fuss (Watto)</u></b><br>
<br>
Start: Strike Planning, Quick Draw, Wokling, Cor: Galactic Senate &amp; Cor: Jedi Council Chamber.<br>
<br>
Julian starts Endor Shield, and uses it to pull General Veers(v) before activating. I play The Professor (v) shield. He then plays his grabber shield, and I play Might of the Republic to grab Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion, before he has Force active to grab it with. Julian then downloads Watto with the junkyard, pulls Ozzel with Endor Shield and deploys him to Mos Espa for the flip, and makes me lose 2 Force with the objective. I lose from hand to avoid the risk of losing something important this early in the game. He then moves Ozzel over to the junkyard, flips back, and ends his turn.<br>
<br>
On my turn, I pull Senator Mon Mothma with SP, activate 3, use 3 to take Senate Hovercam into hand with Wokling, then activate another 5 Force. I search for (and deploy) Saitorr Kal Fas (v) with Quick Draw (v), drop Senator MM and Bail, FoR to Senate in order to flip, and use the 7-side to take So This Is How Liberty Dies into hand, and deploy both it and the Hovercam to senate. I then put out the Battle Plan shield, as I know Ill be taking some damage from Julians objective, and want to limit his options for causing more early-game damage too soon, and end my turn.<br>
<br/>
Julian uses Wattos game text to reveal a card from Force Pile at random. Its an odd destiny (Dr. E combo), so he ends up getting a +1 drain bonus, but due to being on the 0-side, his drains on Tatooine are limited to 1. He elects not to drain at all this turn. Instead, he deploys Blizzard 4 (I think its the virtual version) to Mos Espa, but due to my Professor shield, he chooses not to download an imperial with its game text. He flips his Objective since he once again occupies Mos Espa while Watto is present at the junkyard, and makes me lose another 2 Force (I lose from hand again). Then the walker moves over to the junkyard, flipping back to the 0-side. Ozzel gets in behind the wheel (or whatever you use for steering an AT-AT), while Watto remains present outside, and Julian ends his turn.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I activate 11 Force, and use Bails game text to grab a card from my Force Pile. I pull Mace Windu (v), then in my deploy phase, Mon Mothma grabs the Coruscant: Nightclub battleground (between Senate and Jedi Council Chamber), and I deploy Mace there, with a Jedi Lightsaber from Reserve Deck. End turn.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we just swab drains and direct damage (from Julians objective) for a few turns. I then pull Yoda, Master Of The Force with my Jedi Council Chambers game text, deploy a Jedi Lightsaber on him, and move him over to join Mace on the dance floor of the Nightclub. Next turn, Yoda continues from there into the Senate, since the two Jedi Lightsabers cant both add to drains at the same location (cumulative rule). Ive been keeping Julians hand very small with the flip side of my objective, combined with him having to pay for drains and having relatively low activation, so I dont fear a beatdown on my lone Mace. Julian places his one card from hand on table with his Objective, and I pay 2 to let him deploy it for half-price (due to Professor shield). He reveals it to be Tatooine system, which I like, because Ive been saving some star ships in hand. Julian draws some, and I put two of the cards back down again on my following control phase. After draining at the Nightclub, Han, Chewie And The Falcon comes down to Tatooine, and Mas Amedda joins Mothma and Organa at the senate. Julian spreads a bit on Tatooine to get some damage going. I use Atrocity to reduce his drain of 2 at the junkyard (+1 from Wattos game text). I lose 2 to prevent him from deploying the card he places facedown with the Objective, then on my turn, persona replace the Father Of Rebellion with Bail Organa (v), and start retrieving whenever I drain with a rebel. Obi-Wan Kenobi (v) joins Mace at the Nightclub (to get a rebel there for Bail and the Political effect). Corran Horn drops down to the Death Star: War Room (v), and from there on out, I drain and retrieve, while doing direct damage with Mas Amedda.<br/>
<br/>
Full win, +16 <br/>
Total: 2, +16<br/>
Bounty: Still unclaimed<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 2: DS (SYCFA) vs. Ralf Wachowiak (Sonn-v Nightclub)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Start: DS, DS:DB327, Alderaan, Endor Shield, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, A Million Voices Crying Out.<br/>
<br/>
Ralf goes first, due to It Is The Future You See (v), and pulls Saitorr Kal Fas (v) with Quick Draw (v). Then he deploys Yoda, Master Of The Force to Nightclub and gets him a saber from Reserve Deck. Puts another Yoda, MOTF on his epic event, and ends his turn.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I first search with Endor Shield, and get both Admiral Motti, Battlestation Coordinator and Grand Admiral Thrawn. I then take Commence Primary Ignition (v) into hand with A Million Voices Crying Out, and activate. I deploy Death Star: Central Core (v) with my Objectives game text, and get the Superlaser with the Cores game text. Motti drops down to Docking Bay 327, and U-3PO goes to party with Yoda at the club. I also drop Kiffex. Motti makes Death Star hyperspeed = 2, so it zooms into orbit around Alderaan. Ralf plays the Aim High defensive shield, and I end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Ralf drops Corran Horn to the Nightclub, break U-3POs cover (stealing him in the process) and draws some cards. Would have liked to get a little more use out of that early U-3PO, but I guess blocking one drain and forcing him to deploy Corran Horn was better than nothing.<br/>
On my next turn, I deploy the Death Star: War Room (v) with my Objective, then deploy CPI(v) to blow away Alderaan and flip my Objective. I use the flip-side to search for a battle ground system, and grab Nal Hutta. I drop the star destroyer Visage to the Death Star (electing not to pay 3 to retrieve with A Million Voices, as I only have 1 card in lost pile so far), and pull a TIE Assault Squadron with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet.  Motti shuttles up to pilot Visage, Death Star moves to orbit Nal Hutta, and Visage + Squadron moves over to the Nal Hutta system.<br/>
Ralf pays to drain me for 3 at the Nightclub. I lose a TIE Sentry Ships from hand and 2 cards off the top of my deck. Then he puts Mace Windu (v) + saber on my Docking Bay 327, plays Speak With The Jedi Council to deploy the Council Chamber and draws a couple of cards before ending his turn.<br/>
During my control phase, I attempt to blow up Nal Hutta, but miss (I needed a 5 or higher). I deploy Chimaera to Kiffex, download a TIE Assault Squadron, and pay to retrieve the 3 I lost to Ralfs Force drain. Thrawn then takes the pilot seat of the Chimaera, and I draw a few cards.<br/>
<br/>
Ralf just drains (for 5 total) and draws.<br/>
<br/>
I attempt to blow Nal Hutta again, this time hitting it, causing Ralf to lose 4 Force from his Life Force. I drain at Nal Hutta for 2, and retrieve 1 (a star destroyer) with the game text of Central Core. I draw some and end my turn.<br/>
Ralf then comes after me at Nal Hutta, with Artoo-Detoo In Red 5 piloted by Luke Skywalker, Strong In The Force. I havent saved any Force, so due to his Draw Their Fire (which I must admit I forgot he had on table), I cant play my All Power To Weapons. He adds a destiny to total power with Lukes game text (draws a 4) and then draws a 5 battle destiny. I draw a battle destiny of 2, and lose Motti to cover attrition. Luke stays in front of my remaining forces (Visage and a TIE Assault Squadron), and I look down at the Lateral Damage in my hand and smile to myself, hoping he doesnt have a canceller.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I drop another star destroyer to Nal Hutta, retrieve 3 with A Million Voices, and deploy a Squadron from Reserve Deck. I play Lateral Damage on Artoo-Detoo In Red 5, and I could swear Ralf just went a little pale. Good, no canceller then! I initiate battle, and play All Power To Weapons, adding a total of 12 power (2 Squadrons). Ralf chooses to add a destiny to power, but he is unlucky and only draws a 2. For battle destiny, he draws a 1, while I draw 5. Power 33 versus power 3. He forfeits Luke for 8, and takes 22 overflow. From then on out, he never comes back into the game. We exchange drains for a turn or two, while I retrieve by deploying star destroyers. <br/>
<br/>
Full win, +28<br/>
Total: 4, +44<br/>
Bounty: Still unclaimed<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 3: LS (Rebel Senate) vs. Kristian Lund (SYCFA)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Oh great. Kristian and I get to face each other early in the tournament. We were hoping to avoid playing each other until possibly the final two rounds, but weve both won both our first games, so thats what happens. In play testing, we found the Senate deck to have about a 60/40 advantage vs. the SYCFA deck, so hopefully thatll hold true for the tourney game.<br/>
<br/>
It didnt. This game was so intense that I honestly couldnt remember much when I was taking post-game notes. We were both completely focused on the game, trying to play to perfection, as that would be what was needed to pull off a win. Senate deck might have had a slight advantage during play testing, but that advantage was evened out by the fact that I was still somewhat new to playing the deck. In the end, the game turned out to be one of the closest games of Star Wars I remember ever having, and the adrenaline we were both pumping through our veins were worthy of a Worlds final confrontation. Very few mistakes were made during the game. My biggest mistake, and probably what cost me the game, was not saving a Force to pay for Lando, Scoundrels maintenance cost when I dropped a late-game Alderaan Consular Ship with Lando piloting to clear his Devastator from one of his battleground systems. I moved the Ship to block another drain, at a system where he had a lone Squadron. I know every card in his deck, and thus I knew that I was taking a huge risk moving in front of it, but I needed to block the drain. Luckily, it seems that I had taken his only star destroyer out of his hand with my Objective, so he couldnt beat me there. He battled, neither of us got destiny, and he won by a few, so I took a couple overflow. Had I still had Lando piloting, I would have gotten two battle destines, and he would have been force to relinquish the system, or reinforce the Squadron. Too bad that Lando was out of play (had too little Life Force left, so I didnt want to lose 2 Force to send him Used). That the ship survived meant that I could drain for free on my following turn, plus do damage with Mas Amedda. Since I didnt have to pay for draining, I also had enough Force to drop Mace Windu with a saber to his Docking Bay, where he had Sidious. I dont recall whether I battled and just missed, or if I didnt have the destinies left to swing, but fact of the matter is, Sidious survived this turn, and Kristian got another round of free drains. Were down to about 3-5 Life Force each at this point. I have a Sorry About The Mess combo in hand, and I know the bottom card of my Reserve Deck is an Admirals Order (destiny 6), so if I can manage to hit Sidious, itll be game over, since he cant pay to drain me anymore. I check destinies (using the 7-side of my Objective to search for a Political effect), and see the 6, and. a 0! Damn Coruscant system is still in my Reserve Deck, and that means I cant hit Sidious, and hell be able to drain me out on his next turn, right as time is called. Had I been able to kill Sidious, I would have gotten the timed win. Intense and fun game!<br/>
<br/>
Full loss, -3<br/>
Total: 4, +41<br/>
Bounty: Still unclaimed<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 4: DS (SYCFA) vs. Paul McPherson (WYS(v))</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Paul starts Insurrection &amp; Aim High, Corellian Engineering Corporation (v) and Wokling (v). He starts Millenium Falcon (v) with Captain Han Solo piloting at the Corellia (v) system.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I do the usual pulling (Motti, Thrawn and CPI). Paul plays We Wish To Board At Once to pull Obi-Wan In Radiant VII and plays Escape Pod (v) to take a Houjix into hand. That he has a Houjix in hand is good information for me, because then I wont overcommit to one system trying to get a huge beatdown in. I can manage my space forces so I overpower him just enough to make him forfeit everything, and possibly use the Houjix to cover 3-5 battle damage. I then proceed to do my regular turn 1 stuff: Pull DS: Central Core, pull Superlaser, deploy Motti, move DS to orbit Alderaan. I play the Do They Have A Code Clearance (v) shield, and the grabber shield. He plays Antilles Maneuver combo to deploy Chewie (v) aboard the Falcon. I grab the Interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Paul deploys Dash Rendar (v) and Palejo Rashad to separate Corellia sites, for the flip. He uses the flip side to deploy Mirax Terrik to same location as Palejo (or was it Dash? Dont recall, and doesnt matter). He attempts to move the Falcon to the Death Star, but the destiny draw is a 2, and the Falcon is hyperspeed = 0 for remainder of turn.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I blow up Alderaan, and proceed to draw some cards, as I have no star destoyers in my opening hand. I do manage to get 3-4 into hand this turn though.<br/>
On Pauls turn, he drains me for a few, then moves the Falcon to Death Star (successfully this time) and draws some cards.<br/>
<br/>
I deploy a star destroyer to Death Star, fetch a Squadron, and deploy Imperial Justice (v) (getting Victory (v), Why Didnt You Tell Me (v) and Vengeance on it), and initiate battle against his Falcon w/ Han &amp; Chewie. I play All Power To Weapons, and take Victory (v) into hand from Imperial Justice to limit his battle destinies. He draws a 5 or 6 for battle destiny, dont remember what I draw. When the dust settles, he forfeits both Han and Chewie to cover overflow, while I lose my TIE Assault Squadron. Falcon remains at Death Star system.<br/>
<br/>
On Pauls turn, he draws a bunch, then passes back to me. I get Victory (v) with Thrawn piloting and a Squadron down to Corellia system, deploy ships to pretty much every system on table, move Death Star over to orbit Nal Hutta. Paul tries to get back into space a few times, but I clear him every time, taking minimal losses, and retrieving. I take a few drains and deal a few of my own. Then I blow up a system for some direct Force loss, play some more destroyers to retrieve everything from my Lost Pile, and drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
Full win, +22<br/>
Total: 6, +63<br/>
Bounty: Still unclaimed<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 5: DS (SYCFA) vs. Ziemowit Kryptofis Skwara (QMC)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Ziemowit starts the usual QMC stuff: Beldons Eye (v), Keeping The Empire Out Forever and Wokling (v)<br/>
<br/>
'Krypto' (as he was known all day, since none of us wanted to sprain our tongues trying to pronounce his name) is currently undefeated, and also has a reputation from the PC-forums of being a good player, so I know this game will be tough. We draw starting hands, and my heart sinks I get 2 squadrons and not a single star destroyer (and there are 9 in the deck!!) in my hand. I do my usual start, pulling the two admirals and CPI (v), deploy Core, Laser and Motti, and move to Alderaan, then draw the few cards left in my Force Pile. I manage to get a star destroyer, but of course its the Victory, the only non-imperial-class SD in the deck, and Dreaded Imperial Starfleet only lets me download Squadrons when I deploy and ICSD. Tough start!<br/>
<br/>
Krypto drops the CC: North Corridor, puts Kebyc there and Pucumir Thryss to the Guest Quarters, then draws a couple I think, and pass the turn.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, Im still so preoccupied with my bad luck and lack of star destroyers, that I just go ahead and blow up Alderaan as the first action of my deploy phase. Oh crap!... I forgot to seach for the Death Star: War Room (v) first, and now I cant because Im flipped. I can now take battle damage on the Death Star, so a lone Sidious could spell trouble for me. I deploy the Victory, but elect not to pay 3 to retrieve the 1 card in my Lost Pile.. only to later discover that Aim High wasnt even in play. Damn, Im cracking up and making mistakes left and right now. Not good. I play Atmospheric Assault to deploy one of the TIE Assault Squadrons that are stuck in my hand, then shuttle up Motti and draw a few. I still dont get any star destroyers (what is with this bad luck?!), but at least I get a Why Didnt You Tell Me (v), so next turn I should be able to find at least one.<br/>
<br/>
On Kryptos turn, I play the Battle Order defensive shield, he pays to drain for 2 at Kebycs location, then wants to drain for 2 at Pucumirs location as well. I remind him that Pucumir only adds to related locations, not his own, so he asks if he can undo the drain, and Im fine with that. He then gets Harc Seff (v) in the Overseer (v) to Bespin, and flips.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I move the Death Star over to Nal Hutta, play WDYTM(v) and grab Chimaera from my Force Pile. Its the only star destroyer in there, so I just draw a few more cards, and leave a few for next turn. <br/>
<br/>
Krypto spreads and drains on a couple of Cloud City sites.<br/>
I come down against Harc Seff and the Overseer with Chimaera, Thrawn and a TIE Assault Squadron. I initiate, and he reacts with the Spiral. I play All Power To Weapons, after which Krypto cancels the battle with Alternatives To Fighting.<br/>
<br/>
On his turn, Krypto deploys the Home One: War Room, drop Admiral Ackbar (v) there, and then deploys Home One (either from hand or with Ackbars text, I dont recall) to Nal Hutta. Han, Chewie And The Falcon joins it there, against my Victory with Motti piloting and a TIE Squadron. He battles me, I lose everything there and take 1 overflow. He chooses to ignore the Falcons immunity to attrition (I think I drew a bd of 2 or so) and forfeits it, rather than having to maintain or poop it. Since weve always (wrongfully, it turns out) played it so that if your opponent doesnt break your immunity, there is no attrition against you, and you cant choose to forfeit, I had  to call over Gregor for a ruling, since I didnt believe Krypto was allowed to forfeit the falcon. Turns out, I was wrong, and the AR confirms Gregors ruling, so we continue the game. Home One then flies over to Bespin to backup Harc Seff there, and Ackbar moves up from the War Room to take the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I have to leave Bespin to him or face a major loss, so I move over to Nal Hutta (I think) and draw a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Krypto has a drain going for 5 or 6, and he also drops Honor Of A Jedi, so even if I try to blow up a planet to cause a little Force loss, hell only lose 2.<br/>
I drain for 2 and draw some more, trying to get anything into hand that can help me come back into this game before its too late.<br/>
<br/>
Krypto spreads to all systems (Luke Skywalker in some ship, dont recall if its R2iR5, hits the table) and he also sets up Cloud City Celebration. I move most of my fleet to Bespin to block his drain there, and a single Squadron goes in front of Luke to block him there. He drops another Han, Chewie And The Falcon to Lukes location and battle my squadron. I play my Ghhhk (no surprise there), then on my following turn draw up to end my suffering. Never stood a chance that game.<br/>
<br/>
Full loss -32<br/>
Total: 6, +31<br/>
Bounty: Well, Krypto just managed the +25 or more win, so he is well on his way to collecting the EPP Maul reward. However, weve said that  if two or more players pull off a 25+ win on the same round, the player with the highest win, gets the bounty (if theres a tie, coin toss to decide.) I congratulate Krypto on probably taking it home, as I dont see any of my teammates taking a loss higher than this beating I just received. However, Julian Fuss, playing a LS Lightsaber Combat w/ Podracing deck, manages to take Jesper for a full win of +36 (a deck that Jesper will most likely have bad nightmares about for weeks to come), and thus he ends up claiming the prize. Congratulations to Julian, who was awesome enough to ask all four of us to sign the card for him.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 6: LS (Rebel Senate) vs. Chris Menzel (Watto)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Chris starts Guild Of Assassins, Endor Shield and Gift Of The Master. On his first turn, he fetches Blaster Rack (v) with Gift Of The Master, then drops Watto to the junkyard, drops Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber, and uses the AC to fetch Velken Tezeri (v), making me lose 2 Force to Velkens game text. Then he drops Commander Gherant (v) to Mos Espa for the flip, deal me another 2 Force loss with the 7-side. He leaves his 3 guys spread out, threatening a drain of 3-4 next turn. He also fetches Grand Admiral Thrawn with his Endor Shield.<br/>
<br/>
My starting hand is crap. I have no Might Of The Republic, and neither of my 3 Bails. I got Senator Mon Mothma and Saitorr Kal Fas (v) in there, effectively wasting 2 of my 8 starting hand slots, as those are both pullable with my started Effects. Doh! I activate 3, use Wokling (v) to fetch the Senate Hovercam, then active another 5. I put Mon Mothma at the Senate and drop the Hovercam, hoping shell get to live for at least one turn, so I get some bonus activation, and more cards to draw into hand for my setup. Then I drop Battle Plan to avoid the big drain on Tatooine, and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
My hope was in vain. Mon Mothma doesnt get to live. Chris drops Galen to the Senate and takes a card into hand from Used Pile with Guild Of Assassins, since Galen deployed to a Coruscant (or Tatooine) location. He doesnt bother with a saber for Galen, as its virtually useless in the Senate anyway. He then makes me lose 2 Force to his Objective, and battles me in the Senate. We both draw a destiny, and since neither drew 0, and neither has immunity, the site is cleared. Since Chris is the active player, he forfeits first, thus allowing my Hovercam to remain (it would be cancelled if Chris controlled the site).<br/>
<br/>
Since Chris hasnt put out Aim High or Simple Tricks And Nonsense, I hurry up and place Wokling (v) out of play to retrieve Senator Mon Mothma while shes still on top of my Lost Pile. I try to get out Yoda with my JCC, but no luck, hes in the Force Pile somewhere. I draw a bunch and pass the turn to Chris.<br/>
<br/>
Chris drains for two, does 2 damage with the Objective, then drops Thrawn to the Senate, cancelling my Hovercam.<br/>
I deploy Mon Mothma, Bail, Father Of Rebellion and Yoda with his Jedi Lightsaber to the Senate. Yoda is mainly there as forfeit fodder in case Chris attacks, since his saber and game text is useless in there.<br/>
<br/>
Chris then drops JQuille (v) to the Senate and make me lose 1 Force for each of my characters there (3 total). I ask Gregor for a ruling on whether his game text is cancelled by my objective before he can do so, but it is ruled (correctly again, Gregor 2, me 0!) that they are competing actions, and the active player gets to choose the order they are resolved. I lose 3 Force, another 2 from Chris Objective, and Thrawn and JQuille hikes on over to the JCC.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I finally have some useful cards in hand. I drop the Nightclub (with Mon Mothmas game text I think) in between the JCC and the Senate, and then I drop Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) and Lukes Lightsaber at the Council Chamber. I hit Thrawn and lose 1 Force to play Sorry About The Mess &amp; Blaster Proficiency to make him immediately lost. I think draw battle destiny (a 1, Mace Windu), and forget to use Mon Mothmas game text to take my just drawn destiny into hand. That Mace would have come in handy. Due to my low battle destiny, Chris just forfeits JQuille and avoids taking any overflow. Luke then moves to the Club.<br/>
<br/>
Chris consolidates his forces at the junkyard (this might have happened a few turns earlier, dont recall exactly), and deploys Mara Jade With Lightsaber to Mos Espa (taking a card into hand with Guild Of Assassins). Aurra Sing comes down at the Nightclub (getting Chris another card from Guild Of Assassins), with her Dark Jedi Lightsaber (v). She takes a swing at Luke during Chris move phase (using her once per game ability), but I play Blaster Deflection. Aurra then moves over to the JCC.<br/>
Ive managed to get Mace Windu (v) into hand and he comes down at the junkyard, against his Velken Tezeri (v), Watto (v) and Commander Gherant (v). I battle, and hit both Watto and Gherant. Due to the sites gametext, I get no destiny draw, while Chris draws a 6. Ouch! I have to forfeit Mace to avoid taking a large amount of battle damage, and he leaves Velken Tezeri alone at the junkyard. At least I flipped him, and since hed lost a Watto (or two) earlier to my drain, I hope I can keep him on the 0-side from now on.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to clear him from having 2 battlegrounds occupied, so I could Simple Tricks And Nonsense his drain at the JCC. In retrospect, I should have gone after Mara, who was alone and had no immunity, rather than the junkyard-crew, of which Id only be able to clear 2 due to not getting battle destiny. On Chris turn he drains me for 4 at the JCC, move Mara to the junkyard  and draw.<br/>
I play Seeking An Audience (v) then immediately place it out of play to take Mace into hand from Lost Pile. He comes down to the junkyard against Mara and Tezeri. I only have enough destinies left in Reserve Deck for one swing, so, fearing a Force Field (v), I swing at Velken Tezeri and hit. Mara Jade hits Mace, the site is cleared, and I take 4 battle damage. Chris is getting a little low, but Im lower, and I need to play very well to pull off a win here. I pass the turn, Chris smiles, and plays a Limited Resources, making me lose 4 Force since I have 2 or less cards in hand. That is pretty much game right there. He drops Galen to the Nightclub and move Aurra over from the JCC. On my turn, I pay to drain 2 at the Senate (Yoda is still there, adding 1 with his Lightsaber). I think initiate battle with Luke against Galen and Aurra, and die to battle damage.<br/>

Thats it for the tournament. Last round is over, and I ended up going 3-3. Im a little disappointed with myself, but all in all, its been a really fun tournament with some great games, against some awesome people. Ziemowit Kryptofis Skwara ends up going through the whole thing undefeated, and plays against Angelo Consoli in the final confrontation. In game one, Angelos HD(v) with Build-A-Vader beats Kryptos QMC by +11. Its now 9pm and the store were at has to close, about 15 of us go out for dinner at a nearby restaurant where Gregor had already made reservations.. although only for 12 people, so we have to move things around a bit to fit  everyone in. Angelo and Krypto get a table of their own, and finish the second game of the final confrontation right there in the middle of food, beer and curious bystanders. When its all said and done, Kryptos Court Of The Vile Gangster managed to beat Angelos QMC by +12, giving Krypto the first place of the tournament and the trophy that goes with it.<br/>
Congratulations to Krypto for the win, and to Europe for clearing the first of 3 hurdles on the road to Euro-Worlds 2012 on the first tourney of the year! Looking forward to seeing you all again soon.<br/>
