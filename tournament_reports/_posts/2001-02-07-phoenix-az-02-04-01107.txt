Hello All!!!<br>
<br>
    Well, it’s  new millennium and anything is possible, including me being able to play in a Star Wars tournament. I could have played in the I-10 Cup here in Tucson and Phoenix, but I was having too much fun directing it. (= My friends Andres and Justin wanted to play in a tournament Brian Garrison (Bravo 14) was running in Phoenix so we all hopped in the car and hit the road. On the way up we discussed all the types of deck we could expect to face, and how we should play each of them. (Basically, we were expecting Watch Your Step and My Kind of Scum with Abyssins.) And we weren’t too optimistic about our chances.<br>
<br>
    I’ve been having a hard time coming up with a Dark Side deck that I like, so oh... October!! I’m still not sure about my current one, since I haven’t won with it EVER! (0-5) I’ve also switched up my Light Side deck a little since I’m on a current 0-3 streak, and none of those games have been close. We get there in plenty of time. (Because I drive like a maniac no matter who’s car I’m using.) Brian starts calling out the pairing and I hear my name...<br>
<br>
DS - Bring Him Before Me<br>
LS - Mind What You Have Learned, Test to 6 Mains<br>
<br>
Game 1 <br>
LS vs. Chris Shaner’s ISB with lots of Outer Rim Scouts<br>
<br>
   We were joking with Justin on the way up because of his first round pairs in the last couple of tournaments he’s been in. He drew Brian Hunter at the Phoenix Grand Slam, and Mike Girard for Day 1 and 2 at the I-10 Cup. And sure enough, he got Mike Girard again for this tournament. Well, if Justin got his nemisis, then I got mine too. Chris Shaner is the highest rated player in Arizona and Tatooine’s #4 right now. I think I’m something like 0-5 against him. Oh well... the best I can hope for is a strong showing. He starts Coruscant, No Bargain, Power of the Hutt and Secret Plans. I started with Dagobah, Wise Advice, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Draw Their Fire.<br>
<br>
   The game started with very little interaction. He wasn’t able to draw any of his sites and I wasn’t drawing any of mine. But I was able to get Yoda to some Dagobah sites and start getting ready to train. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any of my potential Jedi, so I was forced to use Leia w/. Mainly he deployed Ability, Ability, Ability and 4 Outer Rim Scouts on Jabba’s Space Cruiser. Eventually, he was able to find his Jabba’s Palace and Audience Chamber. He deployed in mass to the Palace. I finally passed Tests 1 and 2, and deployed Jedi Skywalker with Anakin’s Lightsaber to the Audience Chamber with Coran Horn. And so the interaction began.<br>
<br>
    He started deploying Outer Rim Scout and Vigos to the Audience Chamber to battle and retrieve with Scam and Villainy. I eventually lost Coran, Chewbacca and even Obi-wan, but Jedi Luke finally managed to clear out the Audience Chamber and cancel Scum and Villany. It was a close game with each of us having only 10 or so force left. But he spread out to drain and played Abyssin Ornament to retrieve 9 Force. I tried to play Nabrun Leid to beat up a lone Outer Rim Scout but he cancelled it with Ghhhk &amp; Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us. So I had to move Melas in front of him, and Luke in front of another to block drains. He deployed a bunch of characters to beat up on my lone Melas and that was it. Full Loss by 18.   0 (-18)<br>
<br>
The Good... Jedi Luke surviving long enough to finally clear out the Audience Chamber after about 5 turns of battling for each side.<br>
The Bad... The beatdown crew that game to battle Melas at the end of the game. Jabba, Boba Fett w/, Boelo, a couple of Outer Rim Scouts and Vigos. <br>
The Ugly... I got to verify his deck early in the game and I saw more Outer Rim Scouts in his Reserve Deck then I think there are in all of Tucson. Chris current has upward or 200 in his collection.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs. Andres Lopez’s Rebel Strike Team<br/>
<br/>
   Don’t you hate it when you travel two hours to a tournament with two friends and end up playing one of them? Turns out this same thing happened last time Andres and I traveled to Phoenix. We ended up playing twice that night. Well, Andres lost his first game also by 18, so we figured it was possible we&amp;#8217;d have to play each other this game. And we were right. Andres has beaten up on my BHBM deck the last two times were played, but he wanted to try out a new deck, so I felt I might actually have a chance against this one. He started with RST, Strike Planning, Menace Fades and Insurrection. I started with BHBM (and all its stuff), Secret Plans, Imperial Arrest Order, and Mobilization Points. <br/>
<br/>
   First turn I deployed the Emperor to the Death Star II: Docking Bay and Rendilli. For his first turn, he deployed General Madine, Chewbacca of Kashyyyk with his bowcaster, Wuta, and another scout to the Rebel Landing Site. I started with Mara Jade in my hand to so I deployed her and Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Baba to the Cloud City: East Platform. I was activating a ton so I was content with just draw up and getting attack forces ready. Andres used to play RST to blow up the Bunker, so I was expecting that. As it turned out, he switched it up a bit to get a little strong on the ground. So he deployed a few sites and flipped his objective with Hidden Forest Trail, Rebel Landing Site, and Dense Forest. Next turn I deployed the Dominator, Grand Admiral Thrawn and Janus Greejatus to Endor and I flipped him back. He stopped me from controlling Endor by deploying the Liberty there, but nothing else. Well, I had enough in my hand that I was able to start my attack. Darth Vader w/ and Prince Xizor battle General Solo and a scout at the Dense Forest. I was holding a Sniper &amp; Dark Strike in my hand and thought about playing it when I hit Solo, but decided that since he wasn&amp;#8217;t going to get a Destiny anyway, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t bother. He canceled my destiny draw anyway but I beat him on power. I deployed a Death Squadron Star Destroyer and battled the Liberty at Endor. He reacted with the Spiral, but I cancelled it with Ghhhk &amp; Those Rebel&amp;#8217;s Won&amp;#8217;t Escape Us. That gave me control of Endor for good and he wasn&amp;#8217;t able to flip back for the rest of the game.<br/>
<br/>
   But he did deploy Jedi Skywalker to the Backdoor to prevent Your Destiny from hurting him. So I replaced Vader with the Dark Lord of the Sith and his lightsaber. Vader and Xizor started their trek through the forest to the Backdoor. I moved over to the Rebel Landing Site, and his rebels ran to the Dense Forest. I moved to the Hidden Forest Trail, Circle&amp;#8217;ed Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his remain rebels ran to the Rebel Landing Site. Finally I deployed 4-LOM w/ to the Hidden Forest Trail and only moved Vader to the Backdoor, to immediately capture Luke. (Leaving a lone scout to either face Vader or move in front of Xizor and 4-LOM. I used to Emperor to search my Reserve Pile (2 cards) and say I had a 4 and a 6. Next turn, Daughter of Skywalker, and Orrimaarko join the scout at the Back Door and he initiate a battle because he has a 5 ready to kill Vader and release Luke. I figure I might as well try and choke Leia. I draw the 6 and she goes lost. (I&amp;#8217;d rather be lucky than good!) Swing at Orrimaarko and &amp;#8216;hit&amp;#8217; him. And this time I play that Ghhhk &amp; Those Rebels Won&amp;#8217;t Escape Us that I&amp;#8217;ve been holding and I make him go lost too. (Mr. Scout, meet the Dark Lord of the Sith.) He doesn&amp;#8217;t get to draw his 5, and Vader clears the site. After that, it was just a matter of draining him out. Full win by 19.   2 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
The Good... Vader actually being like Vader should be.<br/>
The Bad... Having to face my friend from Tucson in a Phoenix tournament and him being my BHBM deck&amp;#8217;s first ever victory.<br/>
The Ugly... Not much to say... it was a very straight-forward game.<br/>
<br/>
   I have to mention this comment though. Patrick Hug is a very patient man for his Game 2 opponent. He was clearly a newbie and Pat was trying very hard to play his game, teach his opponent and finish the game before the kid reached puberty. But at the same time there were some classic lines... "No, you need 4 ability to draw destiny, landspeed doesn&amp;#8217;t count." But the best was when the kid did and action, Pat replied "Sounds good to me." and he snapped back, "Why should that sound good to you?". Pat was speechless. Good job and being a good veteran player, Pat! (=<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs. Justin Beal&amp;#8217;s Hidden Base Mains<br/>
<br/>
   Don&amp;#8217;t you hate it when you travel to a tournament for two hours with two friends and you have to play them both! Oh well... Justin is a relatively new player, but he&amp;#8217;s improving every day! I know because we talk Star Wars strategy everyday at work. (God, I love my job!) And because he&amp;#8217;s also beaten up my decks the last few times we&amp;#8217;ve played. So I know better to judge him by how long he&amp;#8217;s been playing. He started with Hidden Base, Do, or Do Not &amp; Wise Advice, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Insurrection. I started with the same stuff I did in my last game. First Turn I deployed Rendilli, the Death Star II: Docking Bay and Emperor Palpatine.  In my starting had I also had Darth Vader w/ and a Dark Lord of the Sith. He spent a turn to two to deploy Tatooine: Docking Bay 94 and the Spaceport City: Docking Bay. So I was drawing up and I got Lord Vader, The Circle is Now Complete and Janus Greejatus. (=<br/>
<br/>
   He deploys Obi-Wan and his lightsaber to the Tat: Docking Bay. I deploy Lord Vader with his Lightsaber, and Janus to the Emperor&amp;#8217;s site. The Emperor and Janus transit to the open Docking Bay, and Lord Vader Circle&amp;#8217;s Obi at the other one.  He deployed Jedi Luke to the Home One: Docking Bay but I played Imperial Barrier to keep him there. (I just now realize I forgot to make him lose 3 to Your Destiny.) I drain and continue to activate, draw a few and set up an attack. He deploys Mirax Terrik, Han w/ and Orrimaarko to the Spaceport: Docking Bay and battles. He wins the battle and I send Mirax to the Bacta Tank. Jedi Luke moves to join the party. So for my turn, I deploy 4-LOM w/, Mara Jade (no lightsaber), and Kir Kanos with a Force Pike. When I searched my Reserve Deck looking for Mara&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber I saw my destinies of three 2&amp;#8217;s and a 3. I played Force Lightning Used against Jedi Luke and then initiate a battle. 4-LOM cancels Han&amp;#8217;s text and Kir Kanos &amp;#8216;hit&amp;#8217;s Luke. I win the battle but lose Kir Kanos to attrition. He loses Luke and Orrimaarko. Next turn he gets Mirax out of the Bacta Tank, deploys Jedi Luke from his Reserve Deck (and I barrier him again.) and Leia w/ to the docking bay to fight. I cancel Leia&amp;#8217;s text, but not before he&amp;#8217;s able to &amp;#8216;hit&amp;#8217; 4-LOM and his destiny takes care of Mara Jade, but I still won the battle. After that, I got 4-LOM back to my hand with No Escape, deployed U-3PO in front of Han and Luke at the docking bay and moved the Emperor over to Vader&amp;#8217;s docking bay.<br/>
<br/>
   Leia w/ got out of the Bacta Tank and into the Millennium Falcon to Tatooine and Han moved up to join her. I played Control &amp; Set for Stun to end Leia back to his hand and drop Lateral Damage, Virago, Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Baba and 4-LOM w/. He barriered 4-LOM and I win the battle. Han covers though and gets send to the Bacta Tank. Next Turn Han and Leia come back but quickly move to Rendilli to cancel Lateral Damage, and Luke moves to give in to his father. I drain, deploy the Dominator and draw up a few. The Falcon later comes back, and I battle him. My destinies are too low to get past his immunity to attrition, but I&amp;#8217;m still winning battles and stacking cards. I lose the Dominator but replace it with the Chimera. One more big battle and that was it. I cleared him off of Tatooine and drain him out. Full win by 17.   4 (+18) <br/>
<br/>
The Good... Great battles on the ground and in space.<br/>
The Bad... Having to play my second friend from Tucson in a Phoenix tournament and him being my BHBM deck&amp;#8217;s second ever victory.<br/>
The Ugly... Writing this report and trying to remember all those battles.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs. Brett Kitani&amp;#8217;s Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi<br/>
<br/>
   Death, Taxes and Brett&amp;#8217;s Hunt Down Deck... the rest of the universe is in constant chaos and motion. Brett is one of those people I&amp;#8217;ve never managed to beat. (Unless you count that Jawa Sabaac Deck he tried once.) But it&amp;#8217;s for a good reason too. Brett finished #2 in last years Regional, he&amp;#8217;s in the Top 10 of Tatooine and he also happens to be Arizona&amp;#8217;s #2. It&amp;#8217;s match ups like these that make me wish I was still playing Throne Room Mains with Revolutions. He starts with HDADTJ (no Duel), You Cannot Hide Forever, Imperial Arrest Order, and Mobilzation Points. I start with the same start as last time, MWYHL, Wise Advise, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Draw Their Fire.<br/>
<br/>
   Well, first turn he gets Lord Vader to the Endor: Landing Platform and flips his objective. Fortunately, I also had Out of Commission &amp; Transmission Terminated in my start hand so I cancel Visage of the Emperor. But he also has a good hand and deploys Crush the Rebillion and Broke Concentration. Who plays with Broken Concentration?!?! Who draws that in his starting hand in a game where he&amp;#8217;s actually playing against a testing deck?!?! Mike Girard might be on to something with his comments about Brett&amp;#8217;s luck. But there&amp;#8217;s nothing I can do about it. I have Jedi Luke and Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber in my starting hand, but I don&amp;#8217;t have enough Force to deploy and battle this turn. So I get Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut and Yoda. Next turn he deploys Vader&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Janus Greejaus to the Endor Landing Platform. Oh well... there goes Luke&amp;#8217;s plans. Eventually, Brett deploys Presence of the Force at the Landing Platform and Yavin IV: Docking Bay with Lt. Pol Treidum. Janus moves over and Luke has somewhere to go.<br/>
<br/>
   I drop Luke and Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber but he barriers him. Coran Horn comes down also to battle, but he draws a 5 and Coran dies along with Lt. Treidum. Next turn Janus leaves and Vader, Tarkin and Dr. Evazan go to Yavin IV. I initiate the battle, but miss with my swing at Vader. (Et tu Ben and Chewbacca?) He of course hit&amp;#8217;s me with his swing and then Dr. Evazan operates. Bye Luke. At this point, he&amp;#8217;s got Vader and saber draining for 2 at Yavin IV. The Emperor, Janus, Mara Jade and her saber, and Presence of the Force draining for 4 at Endor. Plus a second Visage starts hitting me again. I send Luke w/ on a suicide run, and there was very little I could do. Full loss by 21.   4 (-3)<br/>
<br/>
The Good... Luke hit the Emperor with his lightsaber. That was neat.<br/>
The Bad... Just about everything else about this game.<br/>
The Ugly... How does Brett get every card he wants, at the very moment he needs it?<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs. Jay Webb&amp;#8217;s Endor Operations<br/>
<br/>
   I have never played against Jay before, but I know he as a good player and that this game will not be easy. He starts with Endor Operations, Power of the Hutt, You Cannot Hide Forever, and Mobilization Points. I started with MWYHL, Wise Advice, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Draw Their Fire. First turn he deploys Kessel. Rendilli, Emperor Palpatine and Perimeter Patrol to the Bunker. I deploy Yoda to his Hut and start drawing a few cards. I eventually get Jedi Skywalker, and Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber.<br/>
<br/>
   He get uses Power of the Hutt to deploy Ephan Mon to the Bunker, and moves the Emperor to the Landing Platform. He also played Masterful Move to get a Ghhgk, but didn&amp;#8217;t leave any force in his Force Pile. (I started with Draw Their Fire.) So I play Revolution on the Bunker, deploy Harc Seff (So now he doesn&amp;#8217;t control the Bunker) and Jedi Luke with Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber to battle. Luke misses with his lightsaber, but he has to lose Ephant Mon and about another 8 Force. Next turn he deploys some more systems, and Zuckuss and Mist Hunter and Dengar in Punishing One to Kessel. I move Jedi Luke over to the Landing Platform and draw up some. Well next turn Lord Vader, Tempest 1, and a couple extra characters come down to beat up on Luke, so I lose him and a lot of Force.<br/>
<br/>
   Harc Seff is safe in the Bunker, so I decide to take this battle to the skies. He now leaves a little Force to use, but I play Frozen Assest on his Force pile and deploy the Millennium Falcon with Han w/, Leia w/ and Chewbacca, Protector to battle against ZinMH and DinPO. I get 3 destinies (6,5,4) and he draws a 1, which Yoda takes care of at his hut. He deployed the Devastator to Rendilli. I moved the Falcon over and blocked his drain. I was also able to deploy Coran Horn to the Cantina to start some drains of my own. Another Star Destoryer joined the Devastator but destinies cleared them both and only Leia was lost. I moved to Sullust to drain him there and the Chimera came down to block. I deploy another Leia w/ and battle again. After that, I drain him out and win by 7.   6 (+4)<br/>
<br/>
The Good... A blind draw of 6,5,4 with the Super Falcon.<br/>
The Bad... Going 1-2 with this Light Side deck today.<br/>
The Ugly... Losing Jedi Luke and 11 more Force in 1 battle.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs. Jay Webb&amp;#8217;s Echo Base Operations<br/>
<br/>
   Well... it looks like Jay will get a chance at a little revenge for the previous game. My deck doesn&amp;#8217;t have a lot of space in it. So I can only hope to set up some drains on the ground and make a game of it. Jay starts with Hoth: Main Power Generators, Hoth: North Ridge and A New Secret Base. I start with BHBM, Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and Resistance.  First turn I deploy Emperor Palpatine to the Endor: Landing Platform, Rendilli and the Death Star II: Docking Bay. For his first turn he deploys some Hoth sites and Figrin D&amp;#8217;an to the Hoth: War Room.<br/>
<br/>
   I force drain with the Emperor and he makes him go lost with Lost in the Wilderness. Well... that was fun. So I deploy Mara Jade to the Cloud City: East Platform and I start looking for characters to search for the Emperor. He gets EBO set up pretty quickly and sets up his fleet at Hoth with Haven. I finally get Janus and 4-LOM w/ to the Endor: Landing Platform to search for the Emperor. I use Janus to start tracking that 5. I cancel one drain of 3 at Hoth with Control &amp; Set for Stun. Then I deploy No Escape to get it back and cancel again next turn. (Who says Watch Your Step isn&amp;#8217;t evil?!?!) I deploy Vader w/ and Search and Destroy to start hitting him for some direct damage. Janus tracks the 5 and the Emperor and I now have Resistance going.<br/>
<br/>
   He deploys Jedi Luke to protect from Your Destiny. So I&amp;#8217;m hitting him for 7 a turn and he&amp;#8217;s going to get me for 6. Next turn he forgets to drain, but deploys Ice Storm to make Vader go lost. ( No more Resistance.) The next turn he forgets to drain again and deploys Kiffex and an X-wing. So I deploy Prince Xizor to the North Ridge, Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Virago to Kiffex and battle him. He tried to barrier Zuckuss, but I sensed it with the Emperor. The Ice Storm came back to get Xizor, but I still control 3 battlegrounds with Kiffex. Next turn I drain him out for a full win by 11.   8 (+15)<br/>
<br/>
The Good... My previously winless BHBM going 3-0 in it’s first tournament.<br/>
The Bad... Winning because my opponent forgot to drain twice with his EBO deck.<br/>
The Ugly... Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, Jedi Luke Skywalker, and Prince Xizor all missing at some point in this game.<br/>
<br/>
   Well, my score was good enough to finish me in fourth place with my only losses coming to the #1 and #2 ranked players in the state. I’ll take that. Brian Garrison, put a bounty on Mike Girard because he was the I-10 Champ, and Mike defended honroably. He won the tournament with his only loss coming to Brett Kitani by 1 Force in the final game. Good job Mike!<br/>
<br/>
   I’d like to thank Brian Garrison for running a great event. Ray and Kim at Gamer’s Edge for having such a great store. Congrats to Mike, Brett and Patrick Hug for all finishing higher then me. Someday I hope to be as good as you. Thank you to Justin and Andres for joining me for a great tournament. Thanks to all my opponents for great games, and to everyone else that participated for a great tournament. I hope to see all of you at the next one.<br/>
