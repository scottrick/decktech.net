<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tourny from Modesto 4-21 <br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
Well this week theres not much to talk about.  I had really boring "star testing" all week but I had lots of time to work on decks and such.  I ended up tweaking the DS Senate some adding more beatdown into it ie Maul YA and his double with a couple Maul Strikes.  I got a box of coursant in the mail and opened it up getting a preety descent box... if it was the first one.  Lottis and Mual and Qui which i really didnt need.  I add another Speaking with the Council into the deck and that made it extremely faster even though I really never had a problem getting the chamber out.  I tweaked the Senate again as the week ended and 4-20 comes LOL.  I wont get into details but I wake up preety early Sunday and get some breakfast "stimulating the mind" and make one last final deckcheck before I head out for Modesto.  The ride was preety uneventful cept I listened to Linkin Park most of the way there(they broke up WTF) and some Bloodhound Gang.  I arrive about hour or so early but Andrew Meewis and the Plesanton crew were there already so I got a test game in with the senate and it worked out preety good.  So everybody arrives within the hour ie Feldman and DaDohMan and we get started with around 8 guys with Shawn Ely coming in late. <br>
<br>
Decks<br>
LS:  Combat 0wnage<br>
DS:  Senate Manip <br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Tony Massungs DS combat racing<br>
<br>
Well this is gonna be a fun game..... but I get a garbage hand.  I worked my way out of it later on.  He activates and starts the race but doesnt flash my generic pod.  I draw a 3 and he picks up the rest of his force.  I drop Jedi Council Chamber and Goo Nee Tay to slow him down ALOT.  He races on his turn but draws low again where i actually get a 7 and use Were you Looking to get Threepio.  He saves most of his pile but draws a few.  I drop threepio and use him to get some crappy garbage.  I draw and finally get Mr.  Liam Neeson.  He races and wins this turn but I only lose 6 thanks to DShield.  Tat Maul comes down to one of the sites with his Mega!! Saber and I love my 6 to the race.  I bring down Qui-Gon and his saber with SaltorKalfus.  I drop a Combat card and so does he.  I combat and draw another 7 and he draws a 1.  So Maul dies and another one flies off the top of his deck during the 4 force loss.  Threepio does his job as he draws up more cards.  I get a drain off and set up the hand some.<br>
I move Qui Over for combat and he FORCE LIGHTNINGs HIM OMFG.  Maul comes back again and gets a combat card stacked.  I drop down with Qui-Gon and he tries to Maul Strikes.  I use strike blocked to cancel one of his combat cards and I win the Maul strikes YAY.  I combat Emperor and make him lose 4 force again.  At this point he has no more Mauls and Emperor is sitting there byhimself.  I make him lose 4 force again but he doesnt combat on his turn.  I drop Luke to the arena for a on the edge but Iggy comes down and caps him on his turn.  I do more combat with Qui-Gon and drop Boussh this time for it and hit it for 6  retrieval.  He doesnt have anymore characters cept for Emperor on the site and I make him lose 4 force for the win.  FW(+28)<br>
<br>
Highs:  I love playing against ds combat<br>
Lows:  Stupid racing<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Cody Dohetrys Combat Racing<br>
<br>
Man whats up with Combat and Racing together...... I dont understand.  Well I get a preety good start with good senators and Lott Dod in hand so I flip first turn as hes starts the race.  He drops Yoda to the Generator for fast drains.  He forgets to race this turn as I manip everything he does with Defensive fire and my Obj so heâ€™ll run out of ideas.  He pays to drain with battleplan and drops Jedi Knight Luke to the other site.  He forgets to race again weird..... ur cards your problem right?  Well I drop more guys in the Senate but the manip is Limited by Goo Nee Tay.  I set up my hand with a Mega Beatdown.  He pays to drain for some and picks up some and leaves only 1 force.  I play this completely wrong cause im a retard.  I play Squabbling for retrieval of 6 which I pay for and THEN play Evader/Monnok lost STUPID.  Hes got nothing to stop my beatdown.  I drop Maul YA with his saber and first strike.  I battle and chop up Luke easily and then play I have you now and Maul strikes.  Well lucky me I draw low and only do around 6 breakthrough.  He starts beginning to race again but doesnt win for another couple turns.  I manip with obj and defenseive fire.  I hit him for a Limited.  He pays to drain for 2 and drops Lando Scoundrel there and pays for his cost.  He wins the race on my turn but I play serect plans for anti retreival.  I lose my 6 force which is filled with crap like Drain Cancler and a few spies with a few garbage interrupts.  He drops Bousssh into the chamber but I break her cover with Hutt Smooch and battle for the game.  FW(+14)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Manip is working good<br>
Lows:  I am fed up with racing......... blah<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs Paul Feldmans Hidden Base Flip(Strike Planning, Do or Donut Combo, Squadassign)<br/>
<br/>
Whats a tourny without plaing Feldman.  I get a really good start or at least I think.  I drop a Dbay from hand, Securtiy Precautions, another Dbay from deck and Lotti Doddi and Aks Moe into the senate for the quick flip and a Political Effect.  He drops Endor from deck first turn and draws up the rest.  I activate and drop more senators into the chamber along with a coursant guard.  Tatooine Dbay comes out for more activation along with Holocam for god activation.  He plays some systems in some random order with Dantooine(aka thinking hiddenbase).  I put 2 cards back everyturn with some defensive fires to limit his hand which is doing wonders for me and making him mad.  I drop Onith and Tat Maul for free to Mauls Hut.  I drain a few times in the senate using Yeb Yeb every so often.  He flips in a few turns with about 8 systems.  I use onith and manip for with the Obj and defensive fires.  I hit him with some Limiteds and use Squabbling to get 2 of them back and play Ability x3 for more damage.  He drains for about 3 per turn with me canceling his Kessel drain.  I keep his hand size at a mimium he loses to Ability a few times.  I send up maul and his ship with zuckuss together to keep the beats from coming.  I decide since his drains are taking toll to move Maul to Kessel and Zuckuss to Dantoooine doing the probing but ITS NOT IT.  So I use zuckuss to prob more systems but none yet.  I use more limiteds and hes down to a few cards.  I get some drains off and my drains in space and yeb yeb kill him off.  FW(+10)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Good game with Feldman<br/>
Lows:  Only winning by this much with like 5 probed cards<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Clayton Atkins Senate Beats<br/>
<br/>
I played against him before and beat him fairly easily but he has tweaked it some so I am ready for anything.  I get a descent hand with my Jedi Chamber and not much else.  He does a quick flip with Lotti and P0rn Free Taa and grabs the political effect so he can toss it and uses the effect to get the backdoor.  I get down the Chamber with Threepio there for some quick tracking.  I draw up some cards to 12 since hes got Crush on the table.  I threepio what i dont need back and get Goo Nee and QuiGon a little later.  He puts around 4 senators in the chamber total which i think were Baskol, Lotti, Tikkes and P0rn.  He doesnt drain in the senate much due to my battle plan shield and he draws up some of his force.  I drop G00 Nee on him and Quigon with Ref 3 saber for some drains and hopefully to bleed out a few of his Mauls.  He Lott Dodds and grabs something after he puts 2 cards back.  Maul comes down against Qui this turn and battls but I dodge away after a 3 card sense war.  I stack a combat card with a tracked destiny I kill off Maul and make him lose 4 flipping back and retrieving my dodge.  He doesnt do much this turn but set up his hand and limit mine.  I get another drain off and drop Yoda down with Qui for beatdown backup.  He has enough force for a good beatdown and I dont have anything to prevent it.  So I decide to play recoil in fear to put his hand back and maybe get the stuff out of his hand.  I do it and it works I got rid of both DrEcombo and Mauli wiht stick so he spends a turn drawing and setting up more.  I drain for more and come down with Mace this time for even more backup.  He Lott Dodds and drops Maul with Saber against my 3 guys.  Battles.  He hits Qui and Yoda as I hit maul and uses the +3 destiny effect to add 3 but I overpower him by 5 so he loses overflow.  Qui comes back again for more drains even though both my sabers are lost so I dont bother with it.  He sends p-59 to his backdoor for drains.  I send Epp luck and hit him for overflow that he ghhks out of.  I drain and he doesnt have enough force to pay for another Maul and I hit a Edge for 6 on Undercover Boussh in the Senate.  FW(+26)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning tourny foil YAY!<br/>

So I end up taking the tourny going 4-0 with a preety descent differential with Andrew Meewis in 2nd!!!@!@!.  I get Houjix foil for my time sw33t.  The stores about to close and everybody is leaving.  I head down to Fosters Freeze with Feldman and we play another game my DS vs his LS with some minor changes he thought would make it better.  I did and they worked out preety good this time me winning by a higher ammout.  Props and Slops.<br/>
