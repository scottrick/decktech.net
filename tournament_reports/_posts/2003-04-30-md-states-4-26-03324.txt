<br>
So I speak with my wife (inside joke for people around here) and she says I can go to an event on the 26th.  I look around at the event choices:<br>
<br>
PA States – I actually thought about going until I realized it was in the middle of nowhere.  <br>
Denville NJ – This was my first choice – I told people I was coming and then I mentioned to Ray Bordier about playing again.  He was in.<br>
<br>
Afterwards I found out that the MD states were being played the same day.  I thought about going because I really wanted to compete in a high level event again so I talked to Ray about it and he was in along with Kafer, Shaw, and Dansbury.<br>
<br>
After talking Ray into driving, plans were set.  Ray was over the night before with all of his cards.  I showed him the V cards and kept telling him that operatives cannot win.  After going back and forth, he decided on his HB matching pilot deck with some new changes from my cards to make it better.  For dark, he decided on his TDIGWATT trooper deck that does speed deal.  He made a few changes like Maul with Saber x2 and some shields and he was good to go.<br>
<br>
Sleep at 3am or so and we get up at 8, do the shower thing (Thank goodness – but hey, my deodorant was horrible – don’t but Old Spice) and drive to the Oxford Valley Mall in Langhorne to pick up the three musketeers.<br>
<br>
Shaw gets the hump in the back (aka the B seat) and we drive down pretty quickly considering we went through a downpour.  We show up at 11, the store is still closed so we snag Quiznos (which I begged to go to.)  We eat and head on over.<br>
<br>
We show up and go over some decklists – I mention to everyone about needing a few cards for my deck and Ray’s and I trade Jeff for a R3 Falcon and some other random stuff I need.  I grab my extra shield for Ray’s deck from Kafer and a P-59 for me and I have Shaw double check my decklists.  <br>
<br>
We end up getting 21 people, which is a nice turnout for me.  Turns out that Denville got 5 so even with us there it would have been 10 people…I liked the 21 better.  So it worked out coming here.<br>
<br>
Game 1 My Light (RTP) vs. Chris Westergard (HuntDown)    <br>
<br>
Lets hope I remember this game…I start DDTA and it stops his mod points.  He gets a docking bay and draws I believe.  I go get Rieekan and on my turn I drop him, pull the Echo Site and the H1 War Room too.  I get r2 from reserve and move him to the next site.  We both lose 1.  His turn he gets Vader down and flips.  I lose and go.  I get Rogue 1, move R2 and I drop an EPP from Hand to flip and kill Vader. I draw some more I also lose.  He drops down Sidious to the Flagship DB and does his thing with drains and all.  My turn I free Leia, path to the DB and drain for 3.  I then deploy Lando and move her to the DB and flip.  He puts out some more characters to cover the docking bays with Vader and Emperor.  I start dropping EPPs to a docking bay so I get around coward.  One turn he drops Mara and Dr E/Ponda vs. Rieekan and Leia but I dodge so he missed Leia,  2 destiny later, both are out of play. He initiates battle vs. EPP Luke with Lord Vader and forgets that persona’s are all OOP, not just Lord Vader.  I resilience Luke back to hand.  The rest of the game is me just EPP madness and OOP Vader, Sidious, Palpatine, and a few other cards.  I do some late game retrieval with Edge and it ends the game.<br>
<br>
Highs – OOP everyone I could.<br>
Lows – keeping Visage going so he would lose quicker.  I could have cancelled it for a larger win maybe?<br>
<br>
Full Win      +14      2 (+14)<br>
<br>
<br>

Game 2 My Dark (CCT) vs. Andrew Simon (RST mains)<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty quick.  I go for Lando and do my activating with the Flagship 2-0 site and the Sail Barge with site plus the AC.  His turn he drops some characters luke Jedi Luke, Crix and beezer to the site.  Luke gets 3 devices plus his saber and he draws. I deploy Labria, Undercover and a CC Docking Bay.  I also drop Bubo from the SE and 4Lom to start moving the Jabba’s Prize.  Bubo eats Crix (that’s bad for him).  On his turn he drops some characters to bubo’s site, I eat someone else (maybe Beezer?) and he kills bubo.  He drops a charge and moves to the bunker.  At this point I take control of the game with Labria and Colo in battles.  I pretty much take over his bunker, killing everyone.  And then have a group sitting at the back door draining while I move Han to the AC.  He had 2 hans in the deck but couldn’t use them which was important.  Bubo later makes a return visit and he kills him also but in the end I flip, and just drain away the game.<br/>
<br/>
Highs – bubo eating<br/>
Lows – bubo getting killed twice<br/>
<br/>
Full Win      +24       4 (+38)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Dark (CCT) vs. Jesse Hartline (LS Senate)<br/>
<br/>
This game was quick to set up then we just went back and forth.  He drops R2 in R5 with Luke to the Naboo system and some senators to the senate and flips.  I drop labria from hand with undercover then some characters to start getting a drain for 3 (which he cancelled the entire game)  He drains for 4 at Naboo a few times and then for the rest of the game I deploy Zuckuss with random fodder only getting one destiny every turn because of the senator that limits.  We basically tied 8-8 in 3-4 battles before I was able to track and SFS/Unsalvageable luke.  He did play another though and then went for a beat down one turn by flashing Wedge but he wasn’t there (he never got him out) and then tried to deploy HC Falcon but I quickly pointed out that Han was sitting on the table already.  I wating him for 2 in drains and he wating me for 1 every turn.  We basically kept going back and forth.  This game ended and we had to count piles.  He had a larger life force so he got win.<br/>
<br/>
Highs – SFS / Unsalvageable combo on Luke<br/>
Lows – never actually draining at the Council Chamber – it was cancelled every time.<br/>
<br/>
Mod. Loss   -22       4 (+16)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My Light (RTP) vs. Chris Anger (Hunt Down)<br/>
<br/>
This game went exactly the same way the first game vs. Chris was…Vader was OOP quickly and I just drained and retrieved when I could.  I took control of every site I wanted and DDTA again slowed him down.<br/>
<br/>
Highs – Wins like this are fun!<br/>
Lows – there really wasn’t one<br/>
<br/>
Full Win      +16      6 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My Dark (CCT) vs. Greg Shaw (WYS)<br/>
<br/>
Obviously Greg knows every card in the deck because he checked my decklist plus I emailed it to him a week before for ideas.  I knew at this point I lose and I am out.  He cancels my Colo with the Sando from the start so I really only started 2 effects.  I go ahead and activate, deploy my sites and go.  His turn he drops Dash and Outrider to Tatooine.  At this point I am activating a good amount of force and know that since he uses Luke for beatdowns I avoid him J.  This game is fuzzy except I know that I twice did the SFS / Unsalvageable combo to win the game and beat him out of space.  I took over space and the Cantina along with avoiding Luke by putting Labria undercover at his site.  Eventually I battled and killed off Luke and Corran form Cloud City to where he had no characters on the table.  I drained him out after controlling all the locations I could.<br/>
<br/>
Highs – beating WYS and Greg, which isn’t easy to do at all<br/>
Lows – stress while playing him.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win      +14       8 (+46)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My Light (RTP) vs. Kevin Elia (DS Combat)<br/>
<br/>
I run up against Kevin knowing he loses he is in anyway…I assume though that he would rather have some random.player in so I am in for a good game.  I basically free her quickly, drain and kill off everyone I can.  He ends up with Chiraneau in space with Zuckuss draining for 2 by using 4 force.  I have Falcon in my hand and even though my destiny would be 0 I would have played some stuff OOP with attrition but I didn’t want to take battle damage and decide against it. I end up winning this game pretty quickly though, lots of recurring EPPS.<br/>
<br/>
Highs – I’m in the finals and I drained for +4 at a site with Leia because of Prisoner 2187 and Leia’s Back (V)<br/>
Lows – Prophetess….<br/>
<br/>
Full Win      +13      10 (+59)<br/>
<br/>
I’m in the finals and after some prizes we  sit down and play.  He chooses his LS (Combat Racing) vs. my DS (CCT)  I lose miserably because I do not play the racing shield so he wins the race, I Did It, and just hammers me by 37.  Oh yeah, I found out that Lando can be replaced at a 1-0 site with Ephant Mon…that kind of hurt :).  Now I know…no biggie.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 of the finals – I game my self like 3 or 4 turns to try and take out his first turn Maul, I did not succeed, he SFS Artoo into my hand so I just gave up at that point and lost everything from my hand first because I couldn’t come back at that point to win by 38.  He won by 30.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a great tournament and I had a good time.  Kevin kicked by butt in the FC but its ok with me.  Something I didn’t think about was that my rating is going to jump up so I guess maybe I might get close to 2000 again.<br/>
