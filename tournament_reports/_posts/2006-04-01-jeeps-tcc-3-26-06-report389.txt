Twin City Comics<br>
Baby Tech or The Future of Star Wars CCG<br>
<br>
When I heard there was going to be a Star Wars tournament at Twin City Comics on Sunday, March 26, I did a quick check of my calendar and saw the day was open.  Wanting to get back into the tournament scene again after (counts on fingers) six months off, I shot off a few e-mails, made a few posts on the SWCCGPC site and waited.  Now, I havent been absent from SWCCG.  I have been playing SWCCG with two other people who are in retirement: Mike Raveling and Josh Stormcrow Grace.  I have been building decks, mainly testing out the effectiveness of Garrett Larsons Establish Control (v) with BHBM, but its just not working so I have been stumped.  I check Decktech often and read the discussion board on any new tech from the so-called great ones, but find nothing  So as I wait for the upcoming tournament, I e-mailed friend, Mike Raveling, about deck ideas.  We plan to meet Friday before the Sunday tournament, but a family medical emergency keeps me away, so we do our deck building over the phone.  For light, I flip a coin moments before I get paired up with my first round opponent. I had either Reid Smiths b0rk3n TRM abusing Green Squadron 1 (and 5 All Wings Report In Combos) or the lady that brought me to the dance before, my LS Senate/Endor deck.  I go with Senate (basically a coin flip as it has won a vast majority of its games).  For Dark I bring the Maul/Sim Aloo (v) Madness deck.  Mike has been playing online with it and apparently, it dominates so I decide to try it out.  I am glad I did as it did well.<br>
<br>
I arrive to the store about 10 minutes before we start (only after I miss the damn exit for the billionth time).  We have a nice crowd of about 10 people, which out numbers the Magic and VS people scattered throughout the playing area.  After I peruse the wonderful assortment of comic, I notice a familiar face pushing a familiar parental accessory: Garrett Larson pushing a baby stroller.  At first, I think Garrett is carrying his card collection in style, but when I see the bundle of joy start to move, I realize that its no moon, er, card collection but actually his 6 month old baby girl, Dannika  <br>
<br>
EDITORIAL:  Okay, I have a three year old.  Anyone that is a parent will note that playing cards around infants and toddlers is nearly impossible and basically amounts to just placing cards in the table ignorant of what is actually happening.  <br>
<br>
At first I assume Garrett is simply visiting, but he says the only reason he came was because he knew I would be there wow now thats pathetic! (Kidding!) but the presence of his delightful daughter is the reason why I titled this tournament report Baby Tech or The Future of SWCCG as Dannikas vocal performance and acrobatics  during the tournament could be qualified as wicked tech to frazzle your opponent (who can get mad at a baby?) or the fact that since no new players are being introduced to the game, the old players are having to reproduce and breed a new generation of players the old fashioned way thus the Dannika being the future of SWCCG?  <br>
<br>
So parings are announced by the venerable Nick BlueThrawn Kolnik and we have 12 particpants!  For a simple tournament for a dead game, not bad <br>
<br>
Of course, after not playing in a tournament for 6 months, I get stuck playing Garrett  and Dannika great  I am confident that his Baby Tech will have no effect on my since I have a child of my own something like immune to child age &lt;5.  Tech although I think this may have came back to get Garrett in the end (ooo foreshadowing).<br>
<br>
Game 1:Peter Jacobsons LS Senate vs. Garrett &amp; Dannika Larsons DS Walkers.<br>
<br>
Garrett &amp; Dannika start Sando Aqua Monster, You May Start Your Landing, Imperial Decree, and some other effect I think Combat Response, but I am not sure.  I honestly dont have a clue what I am going to do against Walkers and I wasnt expecting to play Garrett and Dannika in the first place so I was a bit shellshocked  I start the same every time: Wokling(v), Strike Planning, and Insurrection/Aim High.  They drop A mini-walker and Veers(v), pulls something with objective, say go.  During their turn I pull Mon Mothma(v).  During my turn I pull Senator Palpatine with Might of the Republic.  Garrett &amp; Dannika have no force a saved.  Dannika releases a cry.   I drop Mon and Palpy to the Senate and flip.  I forget to pull Senate Hovercam all game! (whoops!  Rusty!)  During Garrett and Dannikas turn, I remember that Mon subtracts from non-dueling Epic Events, but I get a quick rebuttal that doesnt subtract from Sando drawn destinies so it sucks to be me!  Sure enough, I cant do anything to them early as a first turn Corran would have crashed their parade the stack a 5 on Sando.  Dannika begins to wail and start climbing out of her stroller Garrett pacifies her by picking her up hes TOTALLY ruining the romantic mood SWCCG creates GOSH! Garrett and Dannika also pull the Coward shield prevent my drains at the Senate I cant seem to get to Buddy Effects down fast enough without giving them a ton of Force and a large hand.  I drop General Han(v) and Princess Leia(v) to the Endor DB.  I cant find the Back Door to drop the buddy effects on, so I have to put them on Han and Leia  Eventually, Garrett and Dannika shoot the generators easily and I lose 8 Force.  I retrieve 4 or 5 back with Might of the Republic right away (thatll give me an extra turn at best!)  Next, I drop EPP Obi on them, but they Barrier.  I back Obi up with someone not sure who.  On their next turn, they drain and do Start Your Landing damage to me.  We battle, and they clear me off Hoth.  My next turn, I drop the Spiral to Endor and shuttle up the love bugs and move to Hoth.  On Garrett and Dannikas turn, they play Walker Garrison.  I cancel one of their drains of 3, but eat another 6 plus YMSYL damage.  I still dink around  for a turn or two, but this one is in the bag.<br>
<br>
FL 20.  0(-2))<br>
<br>
Highs:  Dannika, what a sweety.  At the end of the game, Dannika was on the table watching us and starts to back up and falls off the table.  Quicker than humanly possible, Garrett grabs her with on hand and doesnt need to put down his SW hand that man has SKILLZ!  Nice save, Garrett!<br>
Lows: playing the double-headed monster known as Garrett and Dannika for the first game damn, I wasnt prepared for the sheer power behind such a combo<br>
<br>
Game 2:  Peter Jacobsons DS Maul/Sim Aloo(v) deck Vs. Matt ? Endor Mains.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Matt before, so I know hes a regular player at TCC.  I have never played him and I have never played this new Dark deck using/abusing Sim Aloo(v).  I start Premiere Tatooine, Desert Landing Site, and Wattos Junkyard, Blaster Rack, Combat Response, and Crossfire.  He starts Endor, Chief Chirpas Hut and the Hidden Trail, Saltor Kalfas(v), Squassin, and a third effect  this game was not interactive at ALL!  I have an Maul, Apprentice in my opening hand, so I activate 10 and drop him for free at the Desert Landing Site. I dont need to search for his saber as its in my hand, so I search for Watto and drop him.  I also drop Emperors Power(v).  As I do so, I start counting how many Sim Aloos are in my deck vs my force pile.  I have 5 in the deck, and I see 4 in my reserve, so I know I have to draw, so I spend one and move Maul over and draw.  Now I have a hand size of about 13 cards.   He starts loading characters and ships up at Endor while I mass 4-5 characters at the Junkyard and Dengar, Punishing One, Zuckuss, and Myst Hunter(v) at Tatooine. He has to pay 2 for each pull from reserve deck which slows him down. The only battle came towards the end when I drop Blizzard on a lone Amidala(v).  When I do this, Matt stops me and says I cant do this, but then realizes that he started the wrong site- he meant to start the site that doesnt allow AT-Ats  At this point, therens nothing either of us can do so as I deploy Blizzard 4. to my surprise, I have no Imperial warriors to pull with him, so he draws destiny to clear the site and I clear Amidala At the point, I have decent sized hand, but he still hasnt deployed much to Endor, so I sit tight on Tatooine and do drains of 3 and 1 (with him controlling 2-3 of them).  I have about 20 cards in my reserve and about 10 cards in hand.  Rather than doing something stupid, I decide to stay put.  He finally gets Jedi Knight Luke, Lightsaber Proficiency, and his stick to  the Hidden Trail and begins draining for 3 and 1 now so its a race and I eventually drain him out for the win.<br/>

<br/>
Highs: Sim Aloo working like a champ the deck really seems like the best DS option other there right now.  Matts a great opponent.<br/>
Lows: lack of interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Peter Jacobsons LS Senate vs. Matts Walkers<br/>
<br/>
I joke with Matt after our last game and say we might play each other again in the next round has he has 3 differential and it might be close enough to play each other.  I am worried this game is going to go a lot like the game with Garrett, but since Matt didnt bring any children and wont be using Baby tech, I feel a little more comfortable with my odds.  Also, Matt doesnt start Sando, so I know Mon Mothma will slow things down for him.  This game is more interactive. During his turn, he drops Blizzard 4 and pulls EPP Vader, pulls something with his objective, and lets me go.  I notice he keeps Vader on Blizzard 4. During his turn, I pul Mon Mothma.  I activate a bunch, use Might of the Republic to grab Senator Palpatine and drop them and flip.  I pull Endor and the DB and deploy them.  He points out he has Endor Shield(v) out, so neither of us are generating anything from Endor this game.  On his turn, he grabs something with his objective and doesnt do much more.  I am generating a nice amount, and I noticed he didnt do anything with Blizzard 4/Vader, so I drop Corran Horn and Epp Obi to the 6th Marker and fight.  He loses and decides to lose Blizzard 4 and keep Vader, but I tell him he cant because Vader was inside.  I ask him that he never said he disembarked Vader and I wanted to be sure, so I ask if he meant to keep Vader on board and he said he did.  He curses himself and maybe me to some extent and clears the site.  I lose Corran Horn, but take him back into hand thanks to Correlian Retort(v).  He tries to do some things in space, but since I cleared him off Hoth, he really cant mount much of a comeback and I drain him out for the win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +32<br/>
<br/>
4 (+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Interaction was great.  My Senate deck is still solid and something a little off-beat  I enjoy all the bells and whistles.<br/>
Lows: the Vader/Blizzard 4 thing I would have let him just lose Blizzard 4 if he said he meant to leave Vader out, but he didnt know the rules about embarking/disembarking, so yeah, it was a rules thing<br/>
<br/>
I look over and see Garrett and Alden Peterson had finished playing and Garrett was little more quiet than usual Alden beat him so, Alden is the only undefeated player and they end up playing again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Peter Jacobsons Maul/Sim Aloo(v) deck vs. Jason Jenkins Hidden Base.<br/>
<br/>
Great!  My dark decks first bad matchup!  I know my three ships wont be enough to keep up with him in space, I will need to combine my space fleet and probe carefully.  Jason has been playing SWCCG for a long time, but I make a stupid comment at the beginning to ask him what grade hes in.  He tells me hes 26.  Hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am going to go very shot on this matchup.  Jason gets about 6 systems out, Dash/Outrider, Wedge/Red 2 (not Red Squadron 2), 2 or 3 Y-wings, and Han Chewie and the Falcon.  At one point he tries to move Red 2, but I point out he cant because it doesnt have an astromech.  I probe his hidden base on the first turn (it pays to notice parsec numbers), and he never really keeps me from not doing what I want with my deck.  Sim is slowing him down, my care play of my space clears many of his ships off the table.  The game was interactive, but I seemed to have a counter to many of his actions.<br/>
<br/>
FW +18<br/>
<br/>
6 (39)<br/>
<br/>
Garrett loses again to Alden.  I think Dannika was now working against Garrett and his concentration as I started to hear her a little more during this game than other games.<br/>
<br/>
Overally, the tournament at TCC was nice. I went 3-1 and took 2nd behind Alden Peterson after he beat Garrett Larsen twice in games 3 &amp; 4. <br/>
