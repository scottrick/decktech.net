<br>
Galid<br>
Audience Chamber<br>
Ozzel<br>
Barrier x2<br>
None Shall Pass (V)<br>
Random Jank<br>
<br>
For light side I drafted:<br>
Our own janky Yoda (no text, just power, ability and forfeit)<br>
EPP Qui<br>
Alter x2<br>
Sense x2<br>
Clash x2<br>
Jedi Saber x2<br>
<br>
Game 1, Dark side <br>
<br>
I got god hand.<br>
<br>
First turn I got out the audience chamber, lower passages, galid, ozzel, search and destroy.<br/>
<br/>
I pinged him for 1.  He drew up (got a bad hand).  I pinged him for 1.  I drained him for 4, deployed a star destroyer to his system and pinged him for 1.  He deploys EPP obi against me.  I use none shall pass (V).  He draws up.  It was pretty much game over from there.  You cant take 7 damage a turn for long in the cube.  We were done in 20 minute.  Almost everyone else timed out.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, Light side<br/>
<br/>
I played Kevin, the only other player not to time out.  I get out Yoda + saber and back him up with 2 scrubs.  He drops down tempest 1 + 5 guys aboard it to one of my sites.  I play two ships to his system.  He drops Vader + saber in front of Yoda and company.  I dont want to lose yoda so I play clash (probably a dumb move).  He plays sense.  I play alter.  He plays control.  Wow, that was old school.  But wait.  I play sense on his sense and I make the draw.  Vader is clashed.  The next turn I play disarmed on vader (the reason I played the clash). I draw up.  He drains me at my site and plays Katana + dominator (V) + pilots to his system.  I play mechanical failure on his tempest 1, but I only managed to draw up elom, corran horn and a scrub.  I play Kal fal in space and a corvette.  I play them all the characters and initiate a battle.  He loses most of the guys off the tempest.  I draw up hunting more characters but only manage to find a few ships.  He deploys the devastator in space and battles.  I lose Kal fal and a bulk freighter. He runs over chasing mech failure (3 sites away).  I cant find any guys, but I manage to block some drains.  I play some more ships to space.  He drops ANOTHER star destroyer and clears the system.  We drain each other for several turns and its looking really close.  I play projection where mech failure is.  He misses the draws 3 turns in a row (so projection saved me).  I dont find any more characters all game (I had 4 Epps and some good peeps).  The game ends with a full win for me +1.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, my darkside vs Grahams ls<br/>
<br/>
I get the perfect set up again, but without evasion.  So I drop a star destroyer to coruscant SE and drain to drain for 1 for the rest of the game.  Next turn, I go to get galid with the AC, but no, hes in the 7 force I have activated.  Oh well.  I drop Raychalt hist + gun to drain for 2 and ozzel somewhere else.  He puts down some ships in space.  I deploy dominator (V) + dreadnaught + laser cannon battery against a lone ship.  He plays hyper escape.  We dont really battle much the rest of the game.  He comes down with Leia.  I have Chokk defending in a battle so he decides not to initiate and just to block the drain.  The game ends with me draining him out and wining by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, lightside vs Grahams DS<br/>
<br/>
He starts the game with audience chamber + scum.  Nice.  Second turn, I deploy the tatooine city outskirts (oh, yeah, I got that too, btw).  I drop down Yoda + saber + kal fal and play alter on scum.  Boom.  He plays reactor terminal and drops some cards back.  Hes a sneaky devil, he puts back a zero and tracks for 3 turns.  Over load, 0 bye bye yoda.  I was wining pretty thoroughly at that point so I hadnt been drawing.  I wish Id have gotten my sense.  I win + a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
We finish in 15 minutes, so we play another one for fun.<br/>
<br/>
This game, he gets owned hard core.  He gets watto to the slave quarters and gets counter beaten by EPP chewie, Tawass Khaa and scrub + Slight weapons malfunction.  I have yoda + saber + kal fal (again?) draining at a site and EPP leia + corran at the cantina.  FW + a even more.  He tried the overload trick.  It got sensed.  <br/>
<br/>
I won the cube by a bunch.  There were very very few full wins, but I managed to get four of them. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
