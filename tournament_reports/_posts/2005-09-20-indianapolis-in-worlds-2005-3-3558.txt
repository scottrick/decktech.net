<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <b>Day 3<b> <br>
<br>
<i>(see also my 2 other TR about Day 1 &amp; 2)<i> <br>
<br>
We decide to prepare for the consolation tournament having place in the afternoon. I re-build and prepare 2 sets of decks, hoping to get a Den of Thieves in the shops, in order to improve my Black Sun  it won't happen <br>
<br>
Game 1  my Black Sun vs Justin Stratton's HB<br>
Another fair player, met for the second time in 2 days (I played an HB). Bad news, I've just taken out my Sec Precautions non-V this morning <br>
I choose to start with Power of the Hutt instead of Jabba's Influence, and flip 1st turn as usual. On my 2nd turn I can't find any DB in my Reserve, so Justin gets a free look at 75% of my deck. On the 3rd turn, I bring The Emperor at Co:DB, but he drops there Jeroen Web (wtf ?), supplied with a Merc Armor (V) and hidden by an Undercover. Honor of The Jedi is now on table, too. So many turns along, I can't even hurt him, while he flips and begins to drain. <br>
I deploy ZiMH with Gela to Kasshyyk, but get barriered. Zuckuss will be my space pivot, but won't succeed in his probing (probes anything but the good system). He deploys another undercover spy (Tanus) to Coruscant, so even when I get an Hutt Smooch combo in hand, he still blocks my drain.<br>
FL by 25 (0 ; -25)<br>
<br>
Game 2  my HB/B-Wing vs Jason Fugati's Walkers<br>
Easy setup for me, he starts only 1 location and the 2 "walker" effects (he seems to have nothing but walkers)<br>
Indeed, 3 walkers hit the table and he plays a Walker Garrison on 3rd turn. I try to get Battle Plan running, so deploy Kirdo + Desert + Sandwhirl + B-wing, but another walker with Igor come to battle  Hit and Run saves my butt a 1st time, and we play hide &amp; seek there a couple of turns. Meanwhile, he's draining hard on Hoth (playing EIGHT Walker Garrisons for a total of 11 in his deck !!!). I can reduce the loss with Imperial Propaganda (great card), Merc Sunlet (idem) and Rebel Planners. I drain him for 8 a turn on 5-6 locations, he drains me for 8 to 10 at the same time, even with and as Battle Plan is on table, he gets the edge by draining more on less locations.<br>
FL by -10 (0 ; -35)<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Mikal (?) &amp; Endor Mains <br>
1st turn flip, but I can't find the Cruiser, so I go for The Emperor. He quickly comes to battle me, but with no significant result. Mace and my agents then play hide and seek between the two Coruscant DB's. He Senses my Masterful Move combo as I'm searching for my dejariks, and then deploys Mantellian Savrip  well done ! I try to wipe him out of my sites and fight two big battles (4-LOM/Boba Fett V/Oota-Goota Solo the first time, Xizor/Guri/Frustration afterwards, but Savrip saves his butt each time). As he's still coming back again and again, I have slowly to hang out <br>
FL by -13 (0 ; -48)<br>
<br>
Game 4 : I'm bye ; a qualified player from the finals was beaten hard and fast, so he joined us for the consolation tournament. I think it was not fair, but so decided the organizing team. This brings us to an odd number, making a total of 5 byes.<br>
<br>
Game 5 : LS vs Brandon Ruck's Tatooine Scum (gee !)<br>
He deploys as fast as usual, bringing Jabba's Cruiser and Gela V to Tatooine (bah !). I respond with 4 B-Wings &amp; according weapons, but don't battle as he Barriered my 4th ship. He deploys Maul &amp; his ship to prevent a fight, and makes Occupation run. By this time, I had all my systems on table, so the few I have to loose get covered by Merc Sunlet V. I'm draining of 5-6 a turn, so he moves Maul for a probe run at the high parsecs, where I have some lone but armed ships (I had changed my base to the low parsec just before flipping). For some obscure reason,  I don't deploy the desert &amp; sandwhirl, what would have saved me later.  I get a Stay Sharp in hand, so I'm confident. So confident. Play it on my control phase, but Brandon grabs  and Senses it !<br>
Another Stay Sharp at Kiffex will be identically cancelled. I try to retrieve some red cards and shoot some other ships like Bossk in bus, but I can't do anything against Maul and the now super-loaded Cruiser. Battle Order hits the table, and I'm slowly drained off<br/>
FL by -15 (2 ; -63)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Jason Fugati again (Hoth speeders)<br/>
He tells me he's from Indianapolis, so he was able to come to Day 1 where he qualified, then staying for Day 2 and 3 ; lucky boy, not having to spend $800 to join from Europe  !<br/>
It will be the only "sad" game I played at the Worlds <br/>
He starts a non-BG site while I flip 1st turn with a Presence on my &lt;&gt; Dprincessoose not to give him another BG, and deploy the Wampa Cave  Lathe + Vigo (drain +1 at non-Coruscant locations). I'm doing a 5-6 force loss a turn. Bad feeling Have I hits the table, but he don't seem to play mains. He says he can't find good cards, and that he activates too few (you know, if you only start with a 2-0 location ). He deploys at once a fistful of cards to my DB (speeder with pilot, piloted sandspeeder, T-16's), I ask him to go slower : I wanted to Barrier his unpiloted speeder, but it's not an eligible target, so I put its pilot out of the battle. He looses a couple of card to attrition (not the pilot, I remember him he's barriered). Jason don't agree, so I take my used pile and shows him  without looking myself  that the second card from the bottom is an Imperial Barrier. He then pretends that this one was played the turn before, and that I didn't circulate my used Pile  wtf ? I had indeed many cards in my used, just because I played a Masterful Move and an Unexpected Interruption. I would furthermore never had let him stay quietly with some scrubs at my DB, just in front of my guys. I ask the judge, and he agrees.<br/>
I loose Reegesk just after he steals a just-forfeited speeder. <br/>
On my turn, I deploy Jabba and some backup, battling and winning but not by much, as he plays Attack Pattern Delta). <br/>
He deploys and initiate another heavy fight at the same place, Attack Pattern Delta again and looses other vehicles while only Jodo Kast goes lost. On my turn, I put all I can on the site, and smash him (overflow 30+) thanks to "double" Jabba, Xizor and his wife. He becomes angry and draws up  game over<br/>
FW by +28 (4 ; +45)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm finishing around the 20th place (out of 24-26 players), get some boosters. David ends at the "second" place after the player coming from the finals. He gets the $100 cash price and an uncut sheet in its mailing tube. He sells the sheet for $40 so we can pay our cab back to the airport, and gives me the tube so I can take my own uncut sheet without damage on the plane.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're hungry, and we go with the Tennessee team (Jason, Brandon, ) to the Champion's restaurant near the Dome. We talk about Star Wars, our countries, the gas prices, the meal, silly things like tasting root "beer" or asking an ice tea when I though it was iced tea, and laugh all long. The Ohio team (Nate Meeker, Justin Stratton, ) joins soon, so I can make some group pictures. The meal was excellent ( a BBW wrap chicken for me), even if we couldn't recognize our plates when they arrive, but once again far too big for our tiny European stomachs (I think David and I are totally weighting less than an average US player. That was a real celebration party, thanks to all of you, fair guys and skilled players.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning, we wake up calmly for the 1st time, and go to the Convention Center to say goodbye to the organizing team (taking another picture). Four guys come to play the last event (sealed deck), and we talk a bit with Lee Edwards, who played day 1 and awaits the final of LOTR. He hopes to win, as the supporting price is a free trip next year and some "Decipher" $ 60,000  We wish him a lot, and start to play a last fun game with Michael Carr and a French friend of David. This joins us as we take a taxi to the airport.<br/>
We eat some fast food there, and manage to get contiguous seats for all three flights. We take off late at about 4 pm, and land to Brussels at 0730 am (local hour  it was a 25-hour trip, and we don't sleep at all).<br/>
<br/>
I put David on the bus coach to his next plane (he's traveling back to Milan, Italy the same day, landing there around midnight  38 hours after the departure from Indianapolis  and he goes to work early the next morning !). We shake hands and say goodbye, it was a real and great pleasure to have him as traveling mate and sparring-partner. I hope we'll meet again, in a SW:ccg event or not (maybe at one of the following Worlds, who knows  ?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, and sorry for my bad English <br/>
