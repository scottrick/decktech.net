<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well, it's december 7th... and rather than "a day that will live in infamy", I would rather be part of "A day long remembered"<br>
<br>
Which is exactly what it turned out to be.  You see, I retired from competitive star wars play years ago, but the game is a blast. So using an idea borrowed from other games by dt legend John Arednt, I had a plan<br>
<br>
I make a bunch of decks, 4 on each allegiance. Decks designed to be interactive as well as tricky and fun. Invite our old star wars ccg gang over to play. Roll dice for decks each round and see what happens. It takes out any ego or competitiveness, and when you add your friends and throw in some frozen pizza, theoretically it should make for a great time.<br>
<br>
Which is exactly how it turned out. We hadn't all 4 gotten together in like 3 years. Mike "The Judge" Blumberg, myself, Derfman and Justin "Abdullah" Alderman.<br>
<br>
I wasn't able to get 4 of each side, but with a hunt down and a throne room of derf's, we did have 3. No shields, few ep1/upkeep and almost no virtual cards. i wanted to try some themes and cards that not many of us had played. Plus with limited resources, I had to dole out various mains. The others were<br>
<br>
MKOS abyssans - an always hilarious deck<br>
Bring him Before me - with actual lightsabers and weapons defense against those hated EPPS<br>
Quiet Mining Colony - Wedge and rogue squadron hold down cloud city with slippery trickiness on the ground<br>
Profit - seeking audience an audience sets up nekkid threepio and r1 gifted. Ben Kenobi, master luke, qui gon and their lightsaber cards. Again, weapon defense against epps.<br>
<br>
We roll a 20 sider, highest 2 get dark side. I get dark side and roll and get Hunt Down against Justin &amp; Profit.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
<br>
The first game starts with Epp Mara and Dr Evazan/Ponda Baba in the chamber. Vader flips first turn. ben kenobi goes to Toshi Station. We call this game when Yoxgit gets Taken To Jabba and promptly barriered.<br>
<br>
Same start - vader flips first turn. but quigon flips back and we each lose... always "Advantage Profit". r2 gets gifted. Bossk in Hounds Tooth goes to Rendili. After a decent force is assembled, repleat with Talz tech (watch Maul have to swing at talz twice, heh heh), the audience chamber gets invaded. Jedi Concentration causes mucho trouble, and Lando evades a force lightning. We each keep clearing opponents, and gift is hurting. High destiny is keeping Lando from excluding dr E. Eventually the weapons go through and dr e does some nastiness on ben.<br>
<br>
Bliz 4 tramples r2 outside and Justin retreates. The bossk drains and battling have added up. Han remains Jabba's favorite prize.<br>
<br>
meanwhile Derfman and The Judge are laughing away at an MKOS/Throne Room match up. At one point I see like EVERY ls main with a matching weapon against a friggin army of Jabba's Twerps.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
QMC versus Bring Him Before me<br/>
<br/>
I put out a first turn Wedge. I figure he'll be safe, if i last one turn, I have serious back up in either dash or Kyle Heuer. He never makes it as Zuckuss and Admiral Chiraneu Imperial Command. Oh, that hurts, I lost Wedge and Ship.<br/>
<br/>
I am forced to flip with Heuer on the outrider of all things. But the flip helps, eventually, I Lando Vision for the right space ships. I laser cannon zuckuss probably a turn before Thrawn/exec show up.<br/>
<br/>
A power pivot and then Dashrider end up destroying the executor and Narrow Escapes, Paths and Dodge are keeping things very interesting on the ground. Vader finally shows up and he Rises to start dueling, but by this time, all I have is high destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Mike has 2 cards stacked on Insignificant Rebellion. He can't win this game in the normal fashion, i am dueling too high... but all it took would be ONE destiny 7 stacked by Janus, and I was gone. I need to add in a Phantom Menace or something.  BHBM is so cool when you turn Luke.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it was super fun.  I posted this because I want you fellas who don't play at tournaments with to think about getting a game night together with your best friends. <br/>
<br/>
Just use the Arednt model: have all the decks put together before they arrive meet at someone's house (take turns!) and roll some dice. You'll have a blast. If you lose, who cares? Just blame it on the deck (which you didn't put together) or random match ups!<br/>
