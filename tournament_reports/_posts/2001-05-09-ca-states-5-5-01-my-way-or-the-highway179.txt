<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
The week was extremely boring and seemed like it lasted forever.  School really sucks if you don t already know.  After the boring days of homework and tests Friday finally comes around.  On Friday I have a school event called the Tokay 250 which is a bike rally for 250 laps around a track.  The only reason Im doing this is because I get extra credit in like all of my classes so Im happy.  The only thing that made this bearable was having Paul McKelvey one of my testing friends there to talk to.  Chris(who is not going because of SATs in Berkley) and Brandon show up just as the race ends.  We head back to my house for Brandon to make his last changes on his WYS deck by adding the harvest combo and other things that I have no idea what else.  As this is going on Chris calls his friend who is also going to SATs with him.  He then asks them if he wants to study for tomorrow.  HAHAHAHAHA.  That lead to about 20 caps from Brandon.  Who studies on a Friday anyway??  Everyone leaves and Paul comes by around 9 and we play 1 or 2 games and talk tech for a while.  He leaves and I make final deck checks and hit the bed.  I wake up and have my LS decklist already done as I change my DS around adding a few alters for some pesky effects.  I head out about 8:30 going to pick up Brandon since the tourney starts at 10.  We arrive finding ourselves a half-hour early.  We wait around for a while as we see Paul Feldman pull up.  Whats that all about.  If you ve read Enduro TRs you ve noticed that we had a big retirement party for him saying hes never going to pay this game compeativly again.  But what does it matter anyways.  Hardy shows up and we head in.  Everyone fills out decklists and we get started an hour later. <br>
<br>
For state championship we are running 8! Games with a final<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
<br>
DS:  BHBM: My Way or the Highway 2.0 with a few changes<br>
LS:  WYS: High Activation and destiny<br>
<br>
Off to the games<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Alex Stefankos MKOS <br>
<br>
Great a MKOS deck.  I should be able to beat this Im thinking if I play it right.  He gets a huge jumpstart with SE Jabba and Chall to the AC pulling Lower Passageways.  Great that s just what I need.  I pull H1 docking bay and drop Luke with saber and Mirax to Tat dbay for generation and dash in Outrider with dash to flip.  Heres when it gets bad.  He drops Scum pulls Jabbas sail barge with power of the hutt to tat dockingbay with a merc pilot, guri, and 3 skirrlings for free and battles.  I chop the merc pilot and play blaster pro on it to save me some damage.  I end up losing both and about 7 and kill off a skirrling.  I drain which he cancels with his den of thieves.  I Onnee Tay back for Luke and drop Luke, Han and Talon Kraade to Tatdbay and battle.  He wounded wookie on Luke as I shot a skirrling.  He looses the other skirrling and leaves sail barge and guri there.  He drains and sets up Bib and a Skirrling to Lower Passageways and draws some.  I drop Artoo/Threepio to be able to battle Guri and I kill her off.  He drops Zuckuss and Dengar in P1 against dash and kills everything off and moves over to tatooine.  Heres when I get stupid.  He has Xizor and a Skirrling at JP I play Chewie with blaster and battle.  I shot Xizor and play slight weapons but I forget that I cant even draw destiny.  So Chewie eats it and I lose 1 more.  After a few more battles he drains me out.  FL(-5)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Great game with Alex<br>
Lows:  Losing first game and playing like a scrub<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Andrew Andorfs EBO commander luke<br>
<br>
So I get to play an EBO deck which I have been handing problems with so I have tuned it to beat ebo.  I get a fast start but without janus so I just drop Emp to DS2 dbay and play rendilli for more force.  He drops a guy to the war room with echo base garrision.  I got for some fast Your Destiny damage and drop Vader and janus to DS2 docking bay and Vaders stick moving them over to CC docking bay.  He get Commander Luke out of deck and drops Wedge to his other site playing EBO and moving Luke to CC docking bay with me flipping.  I set up my drains and drop Mara with saber to CC docking bay and move Emp and the crew over.  He grabs Hoth and plays Red leader in Red 1 with a xwing laser there and draws up some.  I drain for some with Mara and play boba with blaser and sim aloo to Endor dbay and playing Search and destroy.  Presence goes on Throne Room to max out my drains.  He takes 1 from search and destroy as I duel and die with him drawing a 6 and a 2 me drawing crap even though I have a 2 point total over him.  He drains for 3 and drops wedge and blout to North Ridge for search and destroy.  I hit him for a big drain at Throne Room and duel him winning finally.  He plays lost in the wilderness on Boba/Sim getting Sim missing.  I drop down Ig with Riot battle cap wedge and make him lose Blount and a stack.  He drains me and I decide I have a descent lockdown going so I lose my ships.  Big mistake.  He drops a whole fleet to Yavin and sullust to max out drains totally.  He drains for 9 next turn as ive lost my whole fleet.  I duel and drain.  He drops Spiral at Rendilli so he gets a drain of 12 now.  I get him down to about 10 left and he drains for 12 leave me with 2 left which are a 5 and a 6 so I know I should win the duel.  I drain him for 5 and 3 from duel and search and destroy does him in.  FW(+2)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning I guess<br>
Lows:  Losing all my ships and lateral<br>
<br>
Game 3 <br/>
DS vs Brandon car pool Bales WYS<br/>
<br/>
This is just great already playing someone in my car.  I get a huge start.  Rendilli comes out along with DS2 dbay and Emp and Janus to tat dbay.  He tries to even up the drains with Dash and Outrider to Kessel.  I drain I play battle order to make him pay along with Mara and Saber to Tat Dbay for more damage.  He decides not to pay to drain and draws some.  I pay to drain and Drop Vader with Saber to Cantina to hit for Your Destiny damage.  He pays this time to drain and he drops Luke from reserve and draws more.  I drain for 6 this time.  Which he loses 3 characters off the top a few ships.  About then he already thinks he lost.  He sends some scrubs at me and Theron Nut and ship to Kessel not flipping?  I drain some more and start moving over to the Throne Room.  He drains and drops some guys to Cantina for battle order.  I pay to drain and Drop Iggy to Cantina and cap the RFC and win a battle along with a POTF on Throne Room for mega drains.  He drains some and waits.  I duel and drain.  Next turn he draws up.  FW(+!3)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning <br/>
Lows:  Beating a car member<br/>
<br/>
As of now Paul McKelvey is undefeated.  GO PAUL!!  I go get a Burrito from Baha Fresh as I wait for the next game to start.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Tim Greens Agents of Black Sun <br/>
<br/>
As we walk up he says oh great Im playing you again.  I laugh.  He tells me I must have lost a game or something to be so far back.  I tell him I lost the first game he says oh.  He start with Rendilli and CC docking bay from hand pulling Coursant Dbay and moving Xizor Over.  I drop Dash and Outrider to Kessel and RFC and Wedge to Cantina for a flip.  This stops his generation for the time being.  He only generates a few and draws up saving some.  I drain for 5.  Drop Luke to Tat dbay making sure he cant flip on me.  I draw a few and save some.  He drops a few vigos to Xizors site along with a presence for a drain and activation.  I hit him for 6 next turn dropping Han to back up Luke.  Mirrax and Pulsar Skate to Tatooine for More drains and activation.  After that he activates for a while killing off luke and han with a few hunters.  To end it I drop Lando, Chewie, Han to coursant dbay where he has a presence with Xizor, 2 vigos and Boba with gun.  I shot all of his guys using Blaster Pro to kill Boba so he doesn t get 2 destiny.  Next turn he draws up.  FW(+13)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Only winning buy a little 3 times in a row<br/>
Lows:  Not Much<br/>
<br/>
As of now I am so tired for not enough sleep and everything else with the games going without brake.  I grab so soda at Baja fresh or whatever its called and sit around outside waiting for the next games to start.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs Trevor Hinkleys SYCFA beats<br/>
<br/>
By far out of all the games in the day was the most fun.  Playing Trevor kinda got me back in the mood to keep going on in the day.  He starts off with Emperor into the Cantina and plays Keffix for force.  I drop Dash and Ship to Keffix and Melas + RFC to Tat dbay flipping and playing battle plan.  He doesn t pay to drain and saves up his force.  I drain him for some and drop Luke with Saber along with Artoo/Threepio to Tat Dbay and Wedge and Ship to Alderran moving them over to D* for more drains.  He drains this time and draws and saves some.  I hit him for 6 next turn.  I drop Han with blaster.  With his force he plays Boba fett with gun, 4-lom and Iggy.  Battles me blanks Hans text and captures Artoo as I slice Boba miss.  I draw crap for destiny as he looses Boba leaving everything else there and lose a RFC and Melas.  I drain him for huge.  I drop RFC to D* docking bay and moving Han over there.  He drain each other as I kill him on the next turn.  FW(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Fun Games are cool<br/>
Lows.  Not much.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs Alex Stefankos TIGIH scouts<br/>
<br/>
This game was fast and furious with me getting revenge for the first game.  I drop Emp to Endor Dbay with Janus along with D*2 dbay holding Rendilli for later.  He moves luke over and draws.  I drain for 2 drop Vader with a Saber to Endor and lose my 1.  He drops Crix and pulls Devlar to H1 dbay for more activation.  I drain for 3 drop mara and Saber to H1 battle.  I slice Crix and play Dark Strike on him and kill Devlar and about 4 stacking 1.  He draws up some this turn using his Strike Planning for GENERAL CARLEST RIKEEN.  OMG Hoth General.  I drain him for some setting up my hand a little bit.  He plays Rikeen along with Blount and battles.  I slice Rikeen and dark strike again and win a second battle.  We have a few more battles as I move back to duel and end up dueling him out.  FW(+16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Fast game and seeing Rikeen for the first time in game play.<br/>
Lows:  Not too much<br/>
GO STEFANKO RIKEEN RULES!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 7<br/>
DS vs Phillip Greens HB OMDH<br/>
<br/>
I played this a few weeks before and I beat it due to a fat lateral hopefully I will have the same luck today as last time.  I draw Janus but don t have to force to start the machine up.  I play Emp to D*2 dbay and Rendilli.  He craps Tatooine H1 docking bay and draws up.  I drop Janus and have no battleground docking bay in the deck so I have cant do anything.  I end up dropping Vader to D*2 dbay and drawing up.  He plays Tat dbay and Lando with axe to H1dbay draws up more saving some.  I get the CC docking bay out and play vaders saber.  I drop Mara with saber to H1 killing Lando and some breakthrough and move the crew to CC dbay for some Your Destiny Damage.  He gives up Luke and tries to attack Mara with Chewie, Corran and Wedge who I barrier Chewie and Corran.  I drain him at CC and move Mara to CC dbay and Vader to Endor Dbay losing my 1.  He pays to move them over to Endor and signals for OTE.  I sniper Corran and move vader to Tatoine dbay.  He follows vader.  I end up battling.  I kill everything off and lose a few dropping presence on CC dbay for super drains there.  I end up draining him for a few in the end for the win.  FW(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Phillip always a fun challenging game<br/>
Lows:  OTE I hate that card<br/>
<br/>
Well as I finish that game up Im at 12(+54) everyone I talk to says I have about no chance of making it to the final execpt for Lodi Crew member Brandon Bale.  He tells me its all about the Winning points which I know but still think someone tells me I have too low of a differential.  Then the pairings are called.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8<br/>
LS vs Alfred Dongs Hunt Down or die<br/>
<br/>
This game was fun 1 because playing Alfred is always cool and 2 because of the songs we sang.  We started of with Canadas National Athem as we shuffled that and sang the first verse a few times over.  Then we start.  He gets Lord Vader to Executor Dbay and moves to Tat flipping fast.  I drop down Luke and slice and blaster pro him.  We take 1 from Visage for a few turns.  I drop Dash and Outrider to Kessel with nobody else forgetting to flip like an idiot.  I get 1 good drain and Kessel as he comes down with Blizzard 2 and Veers killing off Luke.  He saves a few as we suck from Visage.  I should have flipped right then but I drain and get a bigger hand size.  Here comes the Bang of the Week.  Chimera with Thrawn along with a Lateral and first strike.  This does me in for about 11 more.  But the fight is not over.  I kill off another Vader and an Emperor or so not getting any space back.  I hit for an On the Edge on Han for 4 getting some of my lost characters back.  I OOC Vader and Emperor but it does nothing.  The drain at Tatooine with Chinerau does me in as we sing Limp Bizkits My way or the Highway.  FL(-17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  If I cant be in the final Alfred is the other guy I would want in<br/>
Lows:  So close but then yet so far.<br/>
<br/>
I end up in 6th place with crap differential as I see my boy Paul against Feldman looking like hes gonna win and head to a final but he ends up losing.   I end up get $10 at the store final standings are like this<br/>
<br/>
1. Alfred Dong <br/>
2. Paul Feldman<br/>
3. Paul McKelvey<br/>
4. Jason Makohon(sp??)<br/>
5. Alex Shenyis <br/>
6. Me<br/>
<br/>
I stick around and get my command card to see how I did and so I can write this.  I see Mendoza there my New Arch Rival who says John Monroe did him in for a couple of time losses he looks and my card and tells me he would give his left nut for my pairings but it kinda screwed me in the end.  <br/>
<br/>
I really didn t watch the final because I was playing Shenyis in a game and watch Brummel and Nghia play a game where Brummel moves a lone RFC to CC dbay where it takes Nghia about 5 mins to decide what hes gonna do.  Brummel says The mind tricks you can play on someone with a lone RFC which is the damn truth.  As Im playing Alex I hear Hardy say Feldman is our new CA State champ which is cool I guess. <br/>
<br/>
