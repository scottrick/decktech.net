<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This time I will write 2 tournament reports fort he same event. This is my first about day 1, where I was TD and some stuff about Europe in 2008 and about the side event of day 2.<br>
<br>
First of all, I would like to thank Chris Menzel, Tamas Papp and Andreas Holtmann for all what they do for the game and mostly a big thank you for their help in organizing the first two-day-event in Europe for swccg.<br>
Maybe because of the fact, that this was the first two-day-event in Europe, we didnt reach the amount of players we normally should have reached. I hope that next year this would change, BUT we noticed, that if we do a lot of things like annoucing it very soon the demand is given.<br>
<br>
The first day there were 11 players and Sibille Schoentauf, well known from worlds and originally my padawan, after Angelo took over her to his (I think its the dark :-P) side. She plays now since some months and won day 1 of Europeans CMPC.<br>
<br>
I feel so sorry, but somehow the command cards for day 1 are gone, so I quickly start into the side event from day 2.<br>
<br>
Place) Name (lost in MPC against)<br>
<br>
1) Sibille Schoentauf (Dirk Friedrichs) 10(+63)<br>
2) Andreas Holtmann (Nico Kreidl) 8(+79)<br>
3) Ralf Wachowiak (Andreas Holtmann) 7(+11)<br>
4) Tamas Papp (Angelo Consoli) 6(+65)<br>
5) Stefaan Lambrecht (Chris Menzel) 4(-38) but dropped after game 5<br>
6) Stefan Albrecht (Tamas Papp) 2(-94)<br>
7) Joerg Dusche Rautenberg/er (Sibille Schoentauf) 2(-136)<br>
<br>
Best decks during both tournaments:<br>
DS: Andreas Holtmanns Watto deck<br>
LS: Sibille Schoentaufs LSC<br>
<br>
Whoever needs the wins and losses for a ranking, please contact me.<br>
Last but not least... who gets the best price support? All want to know, where the Emperor Palpy FOIL of my own personal collect went to...<br>
Cedrick and Sibille got for day 1 (Sibille for day 2) a foil EPP Quiggy and Ralf got my foil Empy.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a bit short, but I want to make my second report ready and then post it.<br/>
Many many thanks for all who came, specially Tamas, and for all your questions (mostly Cedrick ;) ) during the tournament about the rules... Some of them where really hard.<br/>
I hope you all are satisfied with my TD on day 1, even when I screw a bit, but hey, I did it for the first time alone, without much help...<br/>
<br/>
Take care and hope to see you all soon<br/>
