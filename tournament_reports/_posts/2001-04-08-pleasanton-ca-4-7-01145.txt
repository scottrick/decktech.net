<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Friday afternoon I decided to go to the Saturday tourney in Pleasanton for<br>
Steve Daniel’s tourney.  I hadn’t touched my decks since Enduro, so I got <br>
up early on Sat morning (after having been out late Friday night), fixed <br>
my FlOps deck (already on Decktech) so as to remove FlOps and the <br>
non-unique TIEs and instead added several Vaders, Emps, Mara, and unique <br>
TIEs w/matching pilots.  Plus I added Epic Duel, Circle, &amp; Obession.  <br>
So its now just regular Hunt Down w/unique TIEs.  I use Saber &amp; Onix <br>
pilots &amp; ships.  Makes me realize I must’ve been high when I made that<br>
FlOps deck for Enduro.  Man it sucked (yet it still went 5-3).<br>
<br>
After fixing my dark, I was tired and hungry, so I made myself some<br>
breakfast and kept my Light as is.  EBO w/Rogue speeders and xwings.<br>
<br>
I take the train to Warmasters in Pleasanton and we have 20 people <br>
ready for a 6-game tourney.  I pay my $5 and face my first opponent.<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS v Tony Massung’s generic ISB (IAO, Mob Pts, something else)<br>
<br>
I do the ANSB start (as I usually do against ISB), he pulls Coruscant DB<br>
and drops a Probe Droid there.  I get some Hoth stuff, and setup EBO on<br>
my 2nd turn.  He deploys Mara w/saber, EPP Vader, &amp; 2 Snowtrooper Officers<br>
to Coruscant DB by his 4th turn.  He’s also been pulling other DBs and<br>
moves them all to Tat DB.  So he still hasn’t flipped.  Meanwhile, I’ve <br>
got 1 xwing each at Sullust, Hoth, and Kiffex (the 3 systems I play).<br>
I’ve got Spiral in hand and Incom Corp on table.  So needless to say, he’s<br>
hurtin’ from my drains.  He drops Bossk &amp; Zuckuss in ships to Kiffex, I <br>
react w/Spiral, but he draws a 6 &amp; 4 for destiny &amp; I’m cleared there.  <br>
I deploy 4 xwings so as to draw destiny, then play Org Attack and draw a<br>
5 for destiny, to which I add 1 by playing Heading for Medical Frigate.<br>
So he’s clear in space now.  I move Rogue 1, 2, &amp; 3 to Tat DB to block<br>
that drain, while Hobbie drains at his Hoth DB which he deployed under<br>
the Hoth Shield.  A few turns of space drains end the game.  Win by 32.<br/>
2 (+32).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Not deploying a whole lot and never letting him flip ISB.<br/>
Worst: Seeing someone not able to flip ISB.  That’s bad.  Him clearing me<br/>
at Kiffex sucked too, but I just wanted to lure him out.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Kyle Ishimaru’s TIGIH scouts (Strike Plan, Insur, Staging)<br/>
<br/>
With my Hunt Down I always start IAO, Mob Pts, &amp; Combat Response.<br/>
Let me tell you something.  *Never* give up on a game of SWCCG.  You’ve <br/>
always got a chance.  I really saw that in this game.  I had 2 Vaders in <br/>
hand, and I have to lose to Visage on 1st turn.  I lose off the top, its a<br/>
Vader.  I’m in shock, cuz I expect an OOC any second.  He moves Luke to<br/>
Mara’s site so she captures him, then draws an OOC and gets Vader.  Ok, he<br/>
shakes my hand and says it was a good game, but its over.  Not for me it <br/>
wasn’t.  I lose all my Vaders to Visage, get SFS setup, and start deploying<br/>
my systems.  I use Com Response to get the matching pilots to their TIEs<br/>
and get to verify his deck on like 4th turn to see *no* ships!  Yes!  So I <br/>
spread to Endor (sucks that its my system and I can’t activate there!), <br/>
Kashhyyk, &amp; Sullust, using Chiraneau to add to my drains where I have the <br/>
Executor and Dominator (yes, I play Executor in my HD).  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, he can’t draw his sites.  He kills Mara on like the 4th turn so <br/>
Luke is free and I stop losing force to I Can Save Him.  He also cancelled<br/>
Visage on the 7th turn or so w/TT.  He finally gets out another Endor site,<br/>
but he moves Luke there, so I land some TIEs &amp; pilots at the Endor DB to<br/>
cancel Luke’s drain.  He battles me, I forfeit all the imperials, and soon<br/>
after the drains of 6-8 per turn (I was moving my Star Destroyers around so<br/>
Chiraneau didn’t always add at every system) killed him.  SFS really helped<br/>
me recycle TIEs and retrieve much needed force.  Win by 19.  4 (+51).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Winning without Vader (5 are in the deck).<br/>
Worst: Losing so much force to I Can Save Him.  Kyle just couldn’t draw his<br/>
sites and since he had no space I was draining uncontested.  If only I had <br/>
Vader I could’ve really controlled ground too.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Alex Stefanko’s ISB ORS Scum (No Bargain, POTH, Secret Plans)<br/>
<br/>
Another ISB deck?  Well, I start ANSB again and I’m setup by 2nd turn.  He <br/>
can’t find any JP sites so he just draws.  I pray I draw into my Grimtaash,<br/>
but I don’t.  When I pull a Rogue pilot or system, Grimtaash is always in<br/>
reserve deck.  So I get an xwing at my 3 systems, plus at his Coruscant <br/>
system.  He drops Fett in Slave 1 but I barrier.  He puts an ORS aboard it.<br/>
Next turn, I only have 1 xwing to deploy to Fett (Incom Corp is out), but he<br/>
barriers it, so i don’t battle.  He now has his 3 JP sites w/Scum out.  To <br/>
make matters worse, he’s got Gailid &amp; Mosep &amp; ISB agents at all 3 sites, so <br/>
next turn I’ll lose 9 off the top.  He battles me w/Fett to retrieve some, <br/>
I draw a 5 and add 1 w/Heading for Frigate to clear him.<br/>
<br/>
I draw Signal, and pull Menace Fades.  I eat the drain of 9, then deploy<br/>
Menace Fades.  Now its only a drain of 3 off the top and he isn’t going to<br/>
come to the North Ridge where I have Rogue 1 &amp; 2.  To my surprise, he does<br/>
come to Hoth though (with Xizor and some ORS and 4-LOM).  He battles, I lose<br/>
Luke to cover the damage, then I Ice Storm to keep Menace Fades in effect.<br/>
All his guys go missing, &amp; that’s game right there.  He gets all mad, but<br/>
there’s nothing he can do.  I’m draining uncontested as he had to focus on <br/>
the ground to keep Menace Fades from cutting his drain bonuses.  Boy I love<br/>
that card against MKOS &amp; ISB.  Win by 18.  6 (+69).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Menace Fades &amp; Ice Storm.  I had drains of over 10 per turn!<br/>
Worst: Eating that 9 drain off the top for 1 turn.  Lost a lot of good stuff<br/>
in that one.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Chris Green’s HB mains (Insur, Squassin, something else)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I’ll get to use Vader this game, heheh.  EPP Vader goes to his Endor <br/>
DB 2nd turn, so he drops DTF &amp; Jedi Luke &amp; battles Vader.  I hit Luke, so <br/>
they both die.  I show Vader’s TIE next turn to grab Vader (yup, I play<br/>
Vader’s TIE), plus retrieve 1 force w/SFS.  Its funny cuz I had Twi’leked<br/>
for SFS, then we both had to lose to Visage.  He lost an Alter/Friendly Fire.<br/>
I was confused.  I guess he didn’t want to Alter SFS (I have no S/A<br/>
protection except my objective).  Later, when I deployed SFS he realized his <br/>
mistake and wished he had kept it.  Oh well.....I just setup my drains at<br/>
Endor, Sullust, &amp; Kashyyk.  That’s a 6 force drain.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of ground battles in this game.  Vader left the table proabably like 6<br/>
times, but SFS retrieved him and his TIE would recirculate.  The only space<br/>
battle was Chris deploying Dash in Outrider against Saber 2 w/pilot.  He <br/>
cleared me (by reducing my power), but I countered by deploying Executor w/<br/>
Piett aboard and drawing a 4 for destiny.  That was the last of the space<br/>
battles.  He canceled Visage w/ Lando w/Ax, so I deployed Vader to kill him<br/>
plus 1 battle damage.  Emp and Mara held his CC DB and I deployed my Endor <br/>
DB so all his guys were stuck on Endor unless he wanted to pay massive force.<br/>
Once again, the space drains &amp; SFS were the difference in this game, although<br/>
I won my fair share of ground battles too.  It was a very good game and fun.<br/>
Win by 10.  8 (+79).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Killing Luke 3 times and Obi twice.  Holding all locations except the<br/>
Endor DB where he was draining.<br/>
Worst: Vader dying 5-6 times.  <br/>
<br/>
John Monroe and I are the only undefeated players, but he had a timed win.<br/>
So we’re paired and will probably play twice regardless of who wins this<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v John Monroe’s HB mains (Insur, Staging, Squassin)<br/>
<br/>
Both of us had really janky opening draws, so we were drawing for 2-3 turns.<br/>
I couldn’t draw a Vader, but I finally drew vader’s TIE so I used that to get<br/>
Vader to his Tat DB.  HE had pulled Tat, Tat DB, Home one DB, Corulag, &amp; <br/>
Alderaan.  By now I had deployed Endor, Endor DB, Exec DB, Kashyyk, &amp; <br/>
Wakeelmui (w/SFS).  Emp &amp; Merrejk back up Lord Vader.  He cancels Visage at<br/>
this point w/TT, so I drop No Escape, pick up Visage and redeploy it, only to<br/>
have him play another TT *sigh*.  I also deploy Vader’s saber (w/Circle in my<br/>
hand).  He drops Capt Han &amp; EPP Leia in Falcon to Tat, deploys I’ll Take The <br/>
Leader.  I deploy more TIEs and pilots to Tat DB (Leia can’t drain anyway), &amp;<br/>
move Vader w/ some guys to the Endor DB.  I put the Emp’s Shield to Endor, he<br/>
drops Wedge in Red 1, kills the Shield plus 2 force.  I deploy Saber 2 w/pilot<br/>
and SFS cannons there, but don’t battle and just save 3 force to shoot.  As I<br/>
predicted, Wedge ran to Tat w/ the Falcon after deploying Ben to Tat DB.  At<br/>
this point I had moved Vader back to Tat DB and could’ve Circled Obi, but I <br/>
wasn’t confident about my destiny.  So I let him go and he deployed Obi’s <br/>
stick, then ran him to the Home One DB.<br/>
<br/>
So HD is still flipped and Leia’s still just sitting in the Falcon, but Visage<br/>
isn’t on table.  That sucks.  I now have 5 TIEs at the Tat DB, so i fly them up<br/>
to Tat to greet Han, Leia, &amp; Wedge.  Saber 2 is still at Endor and the Executor<br/>
is at Kashyyk (w/Chirneau).  Mara &amp; Emp are at Endor DB, and I replace his Order<br/>
with my Order, which is Fighters Coming In (so my drains are +1 at DBs).  Now <br/>
Vader, Merrejk, and Fel.  He deploys Lando w/Ax to Tat DB, then Jedi Luke to<br/>
Home One, &amp; moves Ben &amp; Luke over to Vader.  I foolishly ignore those guys and <br/>
focus on taking over the Tat system.  Jendon and Yorr are both at Tat so I get<br/>
2 destiny there, plus Piett is in Vader’s TIE, so I play Imperial Command to<br/>
limit him to 1 destiny.  The Falcon dies (as does OMDH which was targeting Han),<br/>
and Wedge runs to Endor.<br/>
<br/>
Now at this point I should’ve moved Mara over to help Vader deal with the Jedi, <br/>
but I was feeling @#$%y after having conquered Tat.  So on his turn he clashes <br/>
Vader, excludes Merrejk (w/Lando), but I react w/Emp’s Sword to soak some pain.<br/>
He also plays Gift to get 4 destiny, and I lose everyone (except Vader &amp; <br/>
Merrejk) plus 7 more.  But now I realize he has no reserve deck, so clashed Vader <br/>
Circles Obi and repays the favor by making him lose 9 force.  Sweet!!  He’s only<br/>
got 5 force left, so my drains next turn kill him.  Win by 14.  10 (+93).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Conquering Tat, Circling Obi, not letting him pull off OMDH.  The reason he<br/>
hadn’t completed OMDH sooner is because I had Secret Plans on table so he needed<br/>
a turn to save force to retrieve with.<br/>
Worst: Not moving Mara to backup Vader.  Mistake on my part.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS v John Monroe’s ISB Big Blue w/Imp Commands (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
Jeez, me facing 3 ISB decks in 1 tourney, can ya believe it?  I start ANSB.  He<br/>
can’t seem to get an Imp Command to get Piett (who gets Merrejk, who gets his <br/>
systems), so he’s just drawing.  He plays 5 freakin’ Commands!  I get EBO out by<br/>
3rd turn, do my usual spread of 1 xwing at each system.  1 at his Coruscant, my <br/>
Hoth, Sullust, and later I get 1 to my Kiffex.  He has Executor at his Fondor w/<br/>
Piett &amp; Merrejk aboard.  He deploys Something Special Planned, &amp; that’s a card <br/>
I’ll be hatin’ for this game.  He drops Bossk in ship to my xwing, I barrier, so <br/>
he moves Exec over to back Bossk up.  I drain for 7 on my turn, (would’ve been 10<br/>
had he not cancelled one w/an ORS on Den of Thieves) and setup Menace Fades by<br/>
having Rogue 1 &amp; 2 at North Ridge.  He has several ATATs, but can’t draw them &amp;<br/>
is losing them all to drains.  So he doesn’t even deploy to the Ridge, and still<br/>
hasn’t flipped ISB (he’s got 3 agents out).  I have 12 cards in hand at this <br/>
point, so he Monnoks me (lost), and gets 2 Org Attacks (I needed those).  At <br/>
least I only had 1 xwing in hand.<br/>
<br/>
However, each turn he is deploying a Star Destroyer (which I barrier, or react <br/>
the Spiral to, or Hyper Escape away from even w/SSPFT) and I am running out of<br/>
places to run to.  He has We’re in Attack Position Now out so his Destroyers have<br/>
immunity w/the ORS aboard.  I also can’t keep paying 3 force per xwing to run <br/>
away.  Now ISB is flipped and he has Ozzel and an ORS at Y4 DB.  I deploy Wedge<br/>
in Rogue 3 there and draw a 5, killing Ozzel (he draws a 5 but Wedge is immune).<br/>
So I’m having to keep my xwings together now and battle his destroyers cuz I <br/>
can’t run.  I only have 1 Org Attack left also (2 were Monnoked away), so I’m <br/>
losing xwings to attrition.  Thankfully I am always able to deploy an xwing from<br/>
Rebel Fleet (after cancelling a drain for me) to an unoccupied system to keep <br/>
Menace Fades in effect.  He’s got Chiraneau adding drain bonuses all over, so <br/>
Menace probably saved me like 12 force throughout the game.  No battles to report<br/>
cuz I ran away from or barriered everything, until the towards the end.  At that<br/>
point, it would be a star destroyer (like Avenger) with 2 pilots aboard (like <br/>
Evax and an ORS), then we battle, I lose an xwing, he loses an ORS (or Evax) &amp;<br/>
just retrieves them during his draw phase.  Not good for me.  I had 2-3 xwings<br/>
at each system (Incom Corp on table).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I’ve got about 12 force left, he’s got about 18....and time is winding<br/>
down.  I draw into an AWRI w/7 xwings on table.  He has no Secret Plans, only<br/>
SSPFT, so i immediately play AWRI and retrieve 7.  Then the TD says we have 1<br/>
minute left.  I tell John to go, and he takes a long time on his turn after he <br/>
drains me.  We’re both at 17 life force now, and time is called.  So he moves<br/>
some guys around to block my drains, leaving me with Wedge’s drain of 1 which<br/>
he loses from his hand.  So that ends my turn and we’re tied up at 17 life <br/>
force apiece.  So we count up our lost piles....I’ve got 13 cards in there, <br/>
John’s got 15 in there, so apparently I get a timed win by 17 (the amount in<br/>
my life force).  Seemed like the wrong way to win (by counting your *lost* <br/>
pile?), but whatever....I was happy to pull that win off.  I can honestly<br/>
say that John would’ve easily had that game had they let it play through cuz<br/>
he had stopped all my space drains and I was losing xwings to attrition<br/>
while he was usually immune to attrition.  Timed win by 17.  11 (+110).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Hey, my EBO just went 3-0....all against ISB decks (totally different<br/>
types of ISB decks; Scum, Big Blue, &amp; generic ISB).<br/>
Worst: Winning a game I should’ve lost, though we played great.  I actually<br/>
would’ve liked it ruled as just a true tie, rather than this whole thing<br/>
about counting lost piles.  I never had that happen to me before.  Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So I get 1st place, and Kyle Ishimaru gets 2nd.  I forgot to record the other<br/>
top finishers, but there were DSII, CC, &amp; JP packs as prizes for everyone.<br/>
I also got a Masterful Move foil, Tim Green got the Signal foil randomly.<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Steve Daniel for the awesome tourney and taking me to the train station.<br/>
John Monroe for the cool final 2 games.<br/>
Chris Green for the good game.<br/>
Nick Stefanko for playing RTP and CPI (not SYCFA) and going 4-2.  I’m<br/>
just glad I didn’t have to play against your CPI deck.  Bye, bye Hoth!<br/>
Everyone who read this, and liked it.<br/>
At least it didn’t rain on my way home.<br/>
Opaque sleeves-I used ’em for the 1st time at this tourney and I<br/>
loved them!  I was tired of the same ol’ clear sleeves.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
Kyle Ishimaru for OOCing Vader 1st turn.  <br/>
Alex Stefanko for getting all mad at my Ice Storm.  Just play Control<br/>
if it bugs ya that much dude.<br/>
The offshore flow for making it so frickin’ cold here!!  I guess I<br/>
just miss the Southern Cal weather.<br/>
Anyone who doesn’t like Weezer.  ;) <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
