<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Baytown Local 101<br>
<br>
Well, it has been awhile for me, but we finally got a tournament together last weekend. Only had a turn out of 6 but man it was fun to be back in the tournament scene again. I guess this is what all players who come back to the game feel when the play in a tournament again. I was never involved on Decktech before when I played, but this time I plan on getting the most out of my playing of this game. <br>
<br>
So here is my first TD, I am not sure how to really do this, so please be nice on the rating. From reading other TDs, I believe the thing to do is let everyone know about Pre, Present, and Post of the tournament, so here I go.<br>
<br>
Pre: Currently I live outside Houston, TX in a town called Baytown. Its rundown town that is right in the middle of like four oil refineries. I used to play when I live in NY back in 2002, but when my family moved to TX, I just quit playing until a few months ago when a friend of my John Miller told me he used to play as well. So we got together and bought cards we needed from the net. After time we decided to get things going here in Baytown. There is REALLY nothing to do in this town. So we started playing at the local Mall in the food court (because there were NO card shops). In time, we met a few more players, Bo Peters and Jim Hunt, who also used to play and found out that we were trying to play from posting local signs at the Mall. <br>
<br>
We decided to run this tournament at the local library in one of the meeting rooms with all the tables. It was really quite weird, but hey, what else are we going to do. As I said earlier, we had a turn out of 6 when John brought his younger brother and his cousin who he had both taught to play and were not really that good. But, they were learning. <br>
<br>
I knew this would be an easy tournament for me, so I decided to play both of my fun decks that I posted so far on Decktech. Since it really didnt matter who won. My light deck was my Leebo QMC and my dark was a CCT Freezing and Retrieval deck. I believe that both of these decks, if played right could be very powerful tournament decks, but they are still a bit different to play, and have their up and downs. The best is just seeing peoples faces when you either put Darth Maul out of play or Freeze Qui-Gon and retrieval 10 with a Bounty and the Detonator.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Light QMC vs. Bo Peters Maul Deck<br>
<br>
When I saw that he was playing the Maul Deck, I got a bit scared because I didnt know he even knew about that deck, and I wasnt sure if I could handle the BIG drains that deck laid out so early. My starting hand was great, Redemption, Bacta Tank, one of the Bargaining Table guys (think it was Vul, Princess Leia (V), Carbon Chamber, Escape Pod (V), Out of Commission, and a Leebo (V) GOD hand for this deck, as you will see. He activates and I could tell was mad because I guess he didnt get a Maul in his opening hand. He played Bantha Fodder to pull URRUR (V) Bantha into hand, but decided not to play him after seeing what was in his force pile. He just drew up 5 and left 4, since he got 9. Before the end of his turn, I played the Escape Pod to pull a Grimtaash. Then I activated 7 and began my deployment. First I took the Upper Passage Corridor, doing so saw that both the Outrider and Dash were in my deck, so I went on and played them for free to Bespin. I added the Leebo from hand for 2 leaving me 5, then I played Vul for free to the Corrider and Princess Leia (V) to the Guest Quarters for 1 that leaves 4. FLIP first turn every time. Now, normally I would either draw or deploy the Chamber and move Leia over, but because he had so many cards in his hand I decided to play the Grimtaash, that is why I took it over the Holo site. BAM!!!!! Two Mauls, Two Maul Sticks, Two Broken Fetts, I never expected a Grimtaash to do SOOOOO much damage to a deck. Then guess what came next, YEP, Out of Comission, and with the luck I was having, guess what guy whose name the deck was named after was put out of play before he could even deploy him for free. Darth Maul. So from there it was pretty much over. I have never heard a man complain more than that, I guess he didnt expect to pull his other Fett and other Stick and two Mauls in that one draw of 5 cards. He got out URROR (V) on his bantha and Wato to the Junkyard next turn, so I pulled Weapons Display (V) and got a card back, which I put on it for relocating. I also lost a card to make the top card of his reserve deck lost with Leebo (V). My turn I activate 9, drain for two and look for a card, I took Qui-Gon and put him out at the Carbon Chamber from hand, left the one force. I put out Ultimatum so I would only lose two. For the rest of the game, nothing much happened. After I got Qui-Gon his stick I was draining for 3 at the Chamber, plus I moved the Outrider to Kessel. A few battles with Zuckess (V) on MH (V) were uneffective with no broken Fett. After draining and getting cards back with the Off the Edges and Flashes. I won the game hands down by 36 with only two cards in my lost pile. By far the greatest win against the Maul deck I ever had. <br>
<br>
FW 2(+36)<br>
<br>
Highs = Grimtaash and Out of Commission first turn for pretty much the game. <br>
Lows = Game was too fast and boring after that, Bo is a better player than this game gave him, sorry Bo<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Dark CCT vs. Jim Hunts Droopy Agents<br>
<br>
Well, I really should have thought about not playing fun decks with all of this big gun decks showing up. I really didnt think they would be here, but hey I guess I was wrong. Jim had been pared up with Johns younger brother and killed him by 44, so I wasnt even in the lead and I had to play against Agents. When I built this deck, I didnt even think about playing against Agents, and how it would play out. So I was VERY afraid this game. Because there was NO rebel, I just flipped first turn, so that was cool. My turn I do as normal and set up Executor for free on Bespin and get Lando (V) on it. I also remembered to retrieve the one card from my lost pile. I went on and put Jodo Kast out at the Chamber because I had the Hidden Weapons in my hand. I set up Firepower (V), first turn baby. He played Thrown Back (V) and with my searches drew and activated 2. His turn he got out like everything, Breathe Mask, Boshuda, Yer Mig, and E Madok (V) then flipped. He had put two guys in the Audience Chamber and one at the desert site and one to another Tatooine desert from hand. He decided rather than give me a card for Firepower, he would battle me with a 5th alien and kill me off since I didnt get destiny. I guess he just didnt expect the Hidden weapons, because I just captured him with a 3 draw. Drew up the rest. My turn I put out All Wrapped Up (V) with SD(V) and Fett (V) from Hand with Jodo. I pulled two more cards Carbon Freezing with the Console and HAYBH(V) with Fett (V) giving him two more cards. I threw down Vader with stick too from Hand just to protect the crew. His turn he decided not to drain after I put out my Battle Order, retrieved with the Kitonok at the desert. Put out another desert and an another Kitonok there for free because he had Max Rebo out, Still only had 4 different species out, so he put two more guys to the unique desert site and drew up the rest. Decided not to come after me yet. Put a card on Firepower (V). My turn I retrieved, then froze the crap out my alien captive by using my Prepare the Chambers and HAYBH (V) and made him lose 8 force. Then pulled my other HAYBH (V) with Fett (V), put a Bounty on him with All Wrapped Up (V), and I played Emergency Deployment (V) to put the Thermal Detonator on Fett. Threw down Maul with Stick to the Desert site with the two aliens, battled, he lost both and I lost Maul. Then I transferred my frozen alien to Fett (V) with my other HAYBH (V) and moved him to the jail where I retrieved -2 for bounty then +3 for the Detonator so that 5 forfeit alien gave me 6 force back with no force for me to play for, that means I got back Maul and both HAYBH (V). I also get to take one of the retrieved cards back into hand. Yep it was Maul. His turn paid to drain for a few and retrieved. Came after Jodo and Vader with three guys, hit one and lost one to destiny leaving one guy. I lost Vader and captured a guy with Jodo. I threw down my other Carbon Freezing, pulled HAYBH (V) Threw Maul with Stick down and 4-Lom from hand battles hit and lost 4-Lom to a weak destiny. Moved Fett back over to the site, he is getting the picture that he is not going to win at that site. So he decides to just set up on Tatooine because he has yet to drain with 5 aliens on the table. He puts out his Tatooine system and a ship with a guy on it, another site from hand and a guy there, then said go. My turn, I pulled the other HAYBH (V), and yes did the same thing I did before Froze the guy meaning another 8 force went lost, drained, transferred, and retrieved with Bounty getting Vader back into my hand. I had no idea this would be this effective against a normally good Agents deck. By now, I had done too much damage for him to make up for, and the fact that I was also retrieving as fast as I was losing it. I got out Resistance and it was a drain race. I won finally with 5 minutes left, Agents always takes forever to beat. Win to me by 17. <br>
<br>
FW  4(+53) <br>
<br>
Highs = Doing a perfect Capture, Freeze, Retrieve, Combo TWICE! It was nice to retrieve the whole game with my objective. <br>
Lows = Playing against Agents, never a fun game, way too hard to beat, even with all of the retrieving. <br>
<br>
<br/>
Game 3: My Dark CCT vs Johns There is Good In Him<br/>
<br/>
Well, I dont know why he played this deck, but he told me he had built a new deck, but I didnt think it would be with that objective. Still dont know what to expect. He gave me Han with Gun, normal since most people are so used to having Jabbas Prize with CCT, they dont need Han. I got out Free Executor and Lando again because I got Executor in my opening hand and pulled Audience Chamber. Put out All Wrapped Up (V) from hand, pulled and put out Carbon Freezing on the Chamber (great because you can play it and not use it until you are ready) then drew up the rest because I didnt have what I needed. Put out Battle Order to keep him from draining. He pulled I Cant Believe His Gone with his Dont Do that Again Start. Put out Goo Nee Tay, then moved Luke over and drew up leaving one. I knew he played with Civil Disorder (V), so I didnt have to worry about the Barrier, I guess he forgot this. Put out Cloud City: DB, I thought I would start some trouble and get Luke off of the table, so I deployed 4-Lom and IG-88 to Lukes site and battled. He saved the force in case I was playing First Strike. He played Fallen Portal targeted IG-88 drew a Qui-Gon with Stick. I cancelled his game text with 4-Lom and just drew destiny. He swung at IG and drew a 2 and a 4, Lando made the 4 a 3 so he missed. I drew a 4 and he drew his Jedi Council, bad luck. So IG got Luke, played HAYBH (V) and I transited them to Cloud City. IG put Luke in the Tower and 4-Lom was hanging out at the jail. I lost two and said go. He was still mad about the bad draws and just played Speak with the Jedi Council to get that 0 out of his deck, then because I didnt have anyone for him to battle, just drew up 2 and said go. I put out Fett (V) and Colo Claw Fish, then gave Han to IG and moved them over and then moved 4-Lom over for all to wait at the Chamber. I put out my There is no Try and Oppressive shields, then lost two for the objective. He put out Obi (V), Chewie, Engraged, and Princess Leia (V) to win a battle and keep me from freezing Han, luckily he didnt have a weapon or I might have been in trouble. He battled played Jedi Presence off of Obi, I played Hidden Weapons targeting Obi and drew a 5 so Lando made it a 6 so he was lost, so he put him out of play to play ICBHG. I put a 6 on the fish and captured Leia and gave her to 4-Lom, I know he didnt see any of that coming. Drew one destiny a 3 he lost Chewie, so I gave him to Fett, because he didnt get destiny, in disbelief he drew up the rest. My turn I had a chose of who I wanted to freeze, to get you up to speed here. I currently have Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewie all captured and Obi was placed out of play, I bet he is wishing he had more characters in his deck. I decided to freeze Chewie because he is already with Fett. I pulled HAYBH (V) and Prepare the Chamber with the console and froze her will a 4 destiny and added with 2 with PTC. He loses 8 plus 2 from drains. I put out my other Carbon Freezing, then I finally get Vader to the Tower, put a Bounty on Chewie, then moved and retrieved. Vader took Luke out of Jail. And I said go leaving IG and 4-Lom with no way to battle them. He didnt have his Qui-Gon yet, so he just put out Kessel and tried to set up his space. My turn I froze Leia, then put her in Jail because I had no cards in my lost pile. Nothing really happened for the rest of the game. He never got Qui-Gon out and just drew up. Me by 31 <br/>
<br/>

FW 6(+84)<br/>
<br/>
Highs = both big battles going my way, no one ever sees the Hidden Weapons coming, very very Lucky with the droid vs Luke battle.<br/>
Lows = Nothing, a perfect game for me, too bad John<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Light QMC vs Johns cousins I have no idea deck<br/>
<br/>
Well, normally the 4th game is a challenge, but due to the weird play out in this tournament I had to play the cousin, who had lost to John in the first game then played the younger brother back to back games, and currently with the way we were all pared I had to play him. He had some weird Tatooine start deck with Combat Readiness (V). Started Tatooine, Mos Esley, and Jundland Wastes. First turn, he put out two guys from Jabbas palace that I didnt even know what they did and put an Expand the Empire on the wastes. Said go, So, I did my think and flipped first turn, no Leebo (V) this turn, but I did get Laudica (V) and Echo Base Garrison out to pull him. I played a Flash and got back my starting interrupt back. Then put out Battle Plan, he paid to drain for 2, then put out old school non v math Vader at Mos Esley and gave him his stick from hand. Drew up the rest saving nothing. My turn I activate, drain and search, found Qui-Gon, JM and gave him his stick and battled Vader. He play I Have You Now, I swung and hit Vader he missed Qui-Gon, I drew a 4 for destiny and he drew two 5s OUCH, total 10 to 18 because he added one to each, math Vader is good on the ground. So I lose Qui-Gon, and he loses Vader. I play THREE Out of Commissions from my Hand to put Vader and like two read cards out of play. He grabbed the third one. He drains on his site and puts like 3 different ships to Tatooine, like random stuff, Vaders Personal Shuttle, Emperors Shuttle, and like a random unique TIE like Black 11. So weird. I activate and search for my 0 destiny hoth droid and play Fallen Portal to show a 5 for destiny, play Off the Edge and get 5 back, he didnt play his Secret Plans shield. I put Leebo finally on the Outrider, put out Bacta Tank, and pull a Bargaining Table guy for forfeit because I had no idea what was coming. Then moved them over to Tatooine. His turn, he drained, put few more guys with the two at Jundland Wastes, and put a Presence there. Then battled the Outrider. He played just Dark Manuvers old school and just TALLON ROLL from hand on Black 11, man, now that is old school. I was not even sure if you still could play old Tallon Roll on the Outrider, but I let it go through and we ended up tied with 12. Very Very lucky, just that way today, as you can tell, after that I just reduced something and killed something with my destiny, he didnt break my immunity. After than I got my other Qui-Gon out at the Carbon Chamber, took his stick from lost pile and it was a drain race back and forth. I was winning because I would follow the two ships and he would move away. I could have got more space out, but I just decided to hold back and drain, Leebo, and play my Off the Edge Flash Combo over and over until I had won. A few small battles here and there, but nothing big, my retrieval saved me again and gave me another big victory for this deck.  Me by 28<br/>
<br/>
FW 8(+112)<br/>
<br/>
Highs = Once again putting a major character out of play early, wasnt really a tough game because he hadnt played that much<br/>
Lows = Nothing, a great game for me, very smooth. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that was it, I hope all of you enjoyed my very detailed tournament report. I am not sure if I did this write, but I like to think that after having read this that you feel more like you were really there. Please give me feedback on how I did. I do want to report more of these if we can get more of them together. Thanks   <br/>
