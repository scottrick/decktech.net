<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <br>
Just one week after the Belgian national, its the turn for the Dutchmen to prove themselves in their own Ryloth national, at hotel St. Lambert, Helmond and that’s in the Netherlands. Ten players showed up (9 Dutchmen, 1 German and the judge was a Belgian :-)<br>
<br>
I agreed with Chris Menzel to replace him as the judge so he could finally play an important tourney.<br>
<br>
Chris was very delighted when I sent him the mail and afterwards it’s logic that someone replaces him because he comes from Hannover (more than 3h driving). Anyway, there is also a need for an extra judge because when he/she might be sick the day of the tourney someone must be able to replace him/her.<br>
<br>
So I replaced Chris and I was looking forward to show my skill as a judge on an important event (I judged some scrub tourneys before), everything has its first time so this report will be a brief summation of what happened that day without detailed reports from individual games so please rate accordingly.<br>
<br>
Players and decks (not in particular order).<br>
<br>
Frans Zwiers (Dark: Tatooine with combat readiness(V) and aliens – Light: Profit)<br>
<br>
Bart Ouwehand (Dark: Tatooine with combat readiness(V) and aliens – Light: MWYHL)<br>
<br>
Marc Van Haastregt (Dark: Bespin mains and toys with combat readiness(V) – Light: WHAP)<br>
<br>
Bas Van Zuilen (Dark: variation on The Maul deck – Light TRM with SAC)<br>
<br>
Martijn Nyman (Dark: CCT with any methods necessary – Light: Profit)<br>
<br>
Chris Menzel (Dark: CCT with prepared defenses – Light: Senate)<br>
<br>
Paul Van Hoorne (Dark: Endor mains and toys with combat readiness(V) – Light: Profit)<br>
<br>
Maarten Rossou (Dark: TDIGWATT mains and toys – Light: agents with kitonaks)<br>
<br>
Koen Van De Velden (Dark: Court of the vile gangsta – Light: agents with jawa’s)<br>
<br>
Dennis Hes (Dark: CCT space – Light MBO Cubsfan’s version)<br>
<br>
Dark cloud city and Light on Tatooine are the most popular decks.<br>
<br/>
I believe the reader has a very good idea on what decks are popular/strong now in Europe and probably in the USA. Expect those decks to come back at the Europeans the 21st of may and at worlds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The games.<br/>
<br/>
No game reports but sometimes I was looking around to find an interesting situation or something funny that might happen.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1.<br/>
<br/>
Marc played Bart’s MWYHL and he moved a lot of his characters to Dagobah. Luke was captured on Dagobah(!) and freed later but Marc did too many damage to Bart and he forced the win.<br/>
<br/>
It’s the only game where dark side won, all other Dark side decks went down with at least 20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2.<br/>
<br/>
Koen van de Velde plays an agents deck but his starting locations were illegal (he had no INTERIOR Jabba’s palace site). He plays without objective for remainder of the tourney (with his light deck). I give this information because its important to check your deck BEFORE you start a tourney, playing with the thought you’re instant meat for half of the games isn’t funny.<br/>
<br/>
Dennis and Chris know each other before, their game is ‘quite noisy’. Dennis couldn’t blow up the death star with his MBO.<br/>
<br/>
I also saw a lone Padme being battled away with 25 overflow. Booooooh<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Bas’ opening hand, unbelievable. He plays a TRM and ALL his locations were in his hand, he activates 16 force turn two. A clear example of a game that is won with your opening hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
Bossk snipers Leia bikini in the control phase, I’m sure he loves that :-P~~<br/>
Myioom Onith sends Master Luke to the used pile!<br/>
I agree with the players that no final confrontation will be scheduled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
<br/>
Someone doesn’t like droids. I see a Send a detachment down(V) and a droid detector. The droid detector is sabotaged ***LAUGH***<br/>
<br/>
At the end of game 5, three players can win this tourney. Two of them play each other; Chris with his senate against Bart’s aliens. The winner is the champion. Paul has a minor chance to win: he needs to win big and Bart should have a time win with not too much differential.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
I had to judge on some occasions and didn’t want to disturb the confrontation between Chris and Bart. Bart turns out to be the winner. I see the disappointment in Chris’ eyes, he told me later that he lost the game due to poor tactically choices. Paul wins big enough to end 2nd place.<br/>
<br/>
I checked one deck from each player (total of 10), I’m happy to see nobody made a mistake except for Virtuals so please write a (V) on your decklist next time or it might result in an automatic game loss next time!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FINAL RESULT<br/>
<br/>
1.	Bart Ouwehand 10(+91)<br/>
2.	Paul van Hoorne 9 (+108)<br/>
3.	Chris Menzel 9 (+98)<br/>
4.	Dennis Hes 6 (+14)<br/>
5.	Marc van Haastregt 6 (+9)<br/>
6.	Maarten Rossou 6 (-28)<br/>
7.	Frans Zwiers 4 (-22)<br/>
8.	Martijn Nyman 6 (-28)<br/>
9.	Bas van Zuilen 4 (-66)<br/>
10.	Koen van der Velden 0 (-183)<br/>
<br/>
After being runner up in the Tierfon national (with only 3 differential short), Bart wins the Ryloth championship. Definitely someone to look out for at the Europeans, that’s for sure. <br/>
<br/>
At the end, I was a bit busy with the prize support and I don’t know what cards came out of the boosters. I didn’t hear shouts; I presume there were no emperors, Luke JK or other fatties coming out.<br/>
<br/>
I sense Light side is winning more games than dark (I forgot to check that). After the tourney I had a good talking with Chris and it was a pleasure for me to replace him. Nevertheless, I want to play the Europeans so Chris if you want to play there you need another victim to judge in your place. I place a bounty on Tania ;)<br/>
<br/>
