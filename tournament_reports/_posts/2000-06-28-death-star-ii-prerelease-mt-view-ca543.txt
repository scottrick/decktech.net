<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well, okay.....so you all expected this a bit earlier from me, but what can I say? I was on 7 hours sleep the entire weekend, had to play the prerelease and the Risa Star Trek Regionals, and harbor guests at my place for the evening......you get the picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
So as promised, the Death Star II Prerelease from Mountain View, CA and thats just the start of the adventure. Friday, I had a few guests over from San Jose, mostly because one wanted to learn and get into the world of L5R. So I spent Friday driving around looking for cards in SF, only to have Steve Daniels car break down about 80 times on the journey. So we went home and called it a night around 3, but me in my infinite wisdom decide to stay up until 5. So we wake up at 8, and start the drive down there without directions, but we made it there, but made it there EARLY for the first time ever. So we sit around waiting for the store to open as I break away from the crowd forming at the door and sit and try to catch some sleep.<br>
<br>
So the door finally opens, they all walk in but Im still outside snoring. I wake up at 1130, and walk in, still nothing much going on, so I sit down and try to sleep some more. Matt and Jake Smith come in, my propietors for the tournament, so I give them props(I'll pay you back later guys dont worry) and head back to sleep. An hour later everyones finally here, and we get issued our opponents and our sides, and I get to play Dark Side......theres goes my previous prediction for my pulling a Jedi Luke. So I open my packs and get SCREWED one again at yet another Sealed Deck event. My only rare was the Admirals Order(which is nice btw) and I lucked out for Igar out of the Endor packs. The Sealed decks for DS players all get Tempest 1 and Tempest Scout 3, but thats such crap compared to the LS starter which gives you General Solo(WTF?) AND Chewbacca of Kashyyyk(WTF??)......ANOTHER WISE DECISION by Decipher to compare 2 MAINS to 2 WALKERS. ok....on to the games....<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
<br>
I made a beta version of my deck and I just sucked....I dropped DS Sullust(2/2 drain site thats anti-Haven) way too early and let him dominate there for the rest of the game. I tried to gain control of ground, and I held off for awhile but it just wasnt enough. Im running low on guys and his fleets alot bigger than mine, plus in addition Im drawing a multitude of zeroes for battle destiny so I get creamed by 30.<br>
<br>
Cumalativate Score: 0(-30)<br>
Highs: Nothing<br>
Lows: Besides seeing how outmatched DS is, I get a crappy pull, and made a crappy deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Im thinking, Im not going to go out like this.....and I start to remod my deck a little, take out locations, throw in more weapons to help me win some of those key space battles, and Blaster Rifles to get rid of General Solo. Im pretty far down at this point, losing by 30 at least, and I play some scrub in the second game.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
<br>
This guy was slower than I was on my 3 hours of sleep. He starts the dumbest system that gives him 1 force and me 1 too........but I changed my starting to Endor and the Back Door so I give him force......I run over Endor, he cant stop me because of the bad restrictions on his side of Endor. He comes down with a few guys to Endor, I come down with some walkers, wipe him off of Endor. He drops another Endor site and now were doing cat and mouse. So hes sitting there on his planet and he has guys on Endor and he decides he wants to PAY to drain me for 1. Well, I let him do that, by all means, until I drain him for free and he realizes what an idiot hes been. It comes down to the battle at Endor where all my weapons took out his B-wings and my Interceptors got beefier due to huis X-wings......I draw 2 6's in 2 battles, Game Over.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+4)<br>
Highs: Winning I guess.<br>
Lows: Nothing too much......need sleep......<br>
<br>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Gibson Yim<br/>
<br/>
It never fails.....I play someone thats way up there where Im not supposed to be, much less hes from my area too. Theres confusion with the command cards and we play a few fun games......then the real one and it turns out he got General Solo in each of his opening hands. So he runs the Back Door the entire game, and I cant get Igar and Tempest together nor can I draw my Blaster Rifles. Things are sucking, he drops every system he can find and decides to spread since my TIEs are all over Endor with no hyperdrives to get them anywhere. This pretty much stays the entire game, I cant get rid of anything and I cant get rid of General Solo(WHAT THE HELL DECIPHER?) so thats game. Loss by 20.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 2(-16)<br/>
Highs: Absolutely nothing<br/>
Lows: Just read the game again...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 <br/>
<br/>
Im sorry I just cant remember the names of my opponents, its been a hell of a week. Well this games all bad for him.......I set up on Endor with a walker and a few Stormtroopers first turn. He comes down and tries to take them out, I draw a 6, he draws a 1.....Ouch. So that clears him off of the Back Door so Im getting a small break there. I take over Endor, and he decides to come at me over there, but he needs to pay more so he decides to forget it. He hangs at Sullust pretty much the whole game, because he doesnt want to pay the cost to move to Endor. Im knocking him for 4 a turn and using his Battle Order against him. It comes down to a pivotal battle.......He drops 3 guys, all forfeit 4 each. He battles me with equal power, I draw a 5, he draws a 4......so I lose a Reserve pilot he's got to lose 2 and leave one there.....I drop more guys and SMACKED the dressilian he left behind for 12......thats game. Full win by 40.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+24)<br/>
Highs: Nothing much<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the prerelease is over, just like that......it was decent, but I expected more. I didnt get much in way of rares or good cards, which pissed me off.....prize support was crappy as well, just 1 pack of Death Star II. I pull Captain Sarkli out of the pack, Pietts nephew, a decent card. I guess Im pissed because I saw the Imperial insignia and thought I got something worth getting.....oh well......To finish things, here are a few spoilers for you, although youve probably already seen these already....<br/>
