<u><b>Ralltiir States 09 Report (Germany) </b></u><br>
<br>
Ralltiir States has always been similar to the European Championship, since the best European players, historically, have always been German in majority. <br>
This report will be long, and I hope a good read. Its also, maybe, the LAST report of pre-errata / pre-V18 you will read. So enjoy it, because it wasnt won by any mainstream decks at all.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Pre-tournament stuff (deckbuilding and stuff). </b></u><br>
So after 2 years, I came back to SWCCG, the culprit being Chris Menzel, who came to say hi to Milano 2 months ago. This led me to look at the boards to find my login password (M.I.A.), which I eventually got with a Flash of Insight (V), and looked at the evolution that the PC did.<br>
<br>
Impressions were good: <br>
- SE were just SE, no more free pulls (I did skip, with my absence, the NPE SE phase).<br>
- There was The Cube, a wonderful idea.<br>
- new V sets with weird stuff (Wookies ? Galen ? note: I didnt yet knew that Wookies were broken)<br>
- new deck types or start<br>
- new images!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, so Im in. I get the erratas (which makes me change some cards). After a few weeks, the first blotches are appearing: the most NPE deck for DS getting helped (Watto) while other strategies are basically killed. I look at my decks: MBO is dead, TIGIH race gets raped by HDADTJ (V) (and others), Bespin CR (new Hyperdeal) is nearly unplayable  Not looking good.<br>
So I look at the new V cards to get some inspiration. The Harvest deck is like meh (I like the concept, but not how it turns out ; I end up playing twice vs. it and beating it twice, not particularly impressed, albeit the crop card concept is cool), Galen isnt really inspiring, Jedi decks either  it seems a lost cause, until I see a gem: Devastator (V). I look at the creators name: Thomas Caspersen, an European. I smile and start trying some deck builds with it, with the help of Fabien Jacques and Tamàs Papp, 2 Team IT members, who were also more or less out of the game before.<br>
For LS, my eyes fell down on getting use of low destinies (high destiny is good, but some cards in your deck are usually low destiny, so why not finding a use for them ?). In these cases, there is usually no need to look at the new cards to find what youre looking for, and again, this proves to be the case. So I find Collision! and Friendly Fire. After some testing in a new MWHYL platform (with Electrobinoculars), it turns out good and with potential, but with the usual MWHYL problems. So I figure I could try building the concept in other decks to see how it fares, and I think first about WYS, QMC, Lu/L(V) and HB, while slowly eliminating the Friendly Fire idea (which is way less playable than Collision!).<br>
My time is short, however, so I dont get into the QMC concept that much. I build a WYS (which then is modified into another version, since the deck has no real low destiny, so Collision! does not really work), a Lu/L(V) (which also turns out Collision-less for the same reasons), and a HB. HB being the last platform built, it was still pretty new and untested before the tournament.<br>
As for DS, I build a EOPS with the Devastator (V) and tweak it with my fellow players during these 2 months, and it proves out very strong and solid, clearing LS space in a most unavoidable manner, so my DS deck choice is set. <br>
For LS, I have then MWHYL (ditched), WYS guns (ditched, even thought it never lost, that was due, I guess, more to luck than something else), Lu/L(V) guns (ditched because while it is nice, it still has some holes, especially in the recent meta), and HB.  <br/>
This last deck, like many others, just ended up way different than I thought. It started to be a Collision deck, with Boshek (V) to pull the Electrobinoculars while I activated tons, with rogue speeders for ground with Commie Luke.<br/>
However, not using Luke Skywalker (V) in a matching pilot deck in HB was basically the most stupid thing you could do, so I switched for a while for a Dash Rendar (V) tech. The deck retooled its space package then, trying to get a 2 retrieval a turn with Jek Porkins (V). This of course led to a deck dilemma: how to retrieve X-W or Rogue pilots when those same cards are supposed to be on table draining ?.<br/>
Two answers came to mind. <br/>
The first was basically saying well, you dont, but in case you lose ships and pilots, youll retrieve them back. Yeah, OK, not bad, but still not the best game winning plan (better not to lose them in the first place, right ?).<br/>
The second answer was well, simply play MORE of them. This wasnt really an easy thing to do. Playing more of them nearly meant playing for space only X-W and Rogue pilots (else, if you play also more other cards for space, you are left with basically nothing for interrupts/etc. to support or counter your or the opponents strategy).<br/>
In the end, however, the deck found a good balance just a week before the tournament, ditching totally the Rogue speeder tech, and some last minute changes helped the deck immensely too. So the HB Unique X-Wings was born, and, while it didnt look like much, it was, and proved, quite powerful.<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Pre-tournament stuff (pick-up games, the place, the players) </b></u><br/>
<br/>
So, with deck chosen, and some other deck builds for pick-up games, I wait for Shewski to send me the V-slips I ordered (a donation to the PC, you could say), and he proves to be a great seller, always on top of things on the matter. The V-slips arrive 12 hours before my plane departs, so Im set. Of course, the PC screws up on dates, so instead of getting all the V-slips, I get ¾ of them, a non-updated V18 (slips uncut) and no errata slips. This basically means Ill have to get another delivery in the future, but then, since a full re-organisation of the V-sets is scheduled by the PC for the end of the year, why bother ? -_-<br/>
 So I kiss my pregnant wife, and get to the airplane (60 round trip FTW) to Frankfurt from Italy, and then to Beisheim, to Andreas house, where he will gently host me with Tamàs Papp.<br/>
Andreas is the TD, organizing tournaments in a very successful manner in Beinsheim, with a strong player base. We decide to do the 3 Judge thing so that he can play. I arrive on time to his place, and we play some pick-up games, both with our official decks and without (albeit Im actually the only one to have build other decks). During those games, Invasion and ROPS (the 2 other fun decks I brought) shine, and I think for a while to play one of them tomorrow, but I scrap the idea, since I prefer the tech I have build in my EOPS, and Ive invested way too much time into it NOT to play it. The fact that the EOPS plays the first card I fell in love with when I was a scrub (Captain Lennox nonV) is also convincing me on the deck choice.<br/>
The evening before the tournament, we go to the place, a huge pub/restaurant on 2 floors with a lot of rooms. The food &amp; drink is cheap and plenty, so it all bodes well for tomorrow.<br/>
We speak a lot about the PC &amp; Europe, and its a big update. Europeans arent really speaking about Worlds. They are mostly pissed about the last erratas and the direction the game is going (i.e. basically only mainstream and tournament decks). Andreas had 8 players phoning him that they wouldnt come if V18 and errata were legal. We werent speaking about dedicated players, but mostly new/returning/casual players. Some dedicated players werent happy with them either, but then, they wouldnt have missed this tournament. There were a ton of good reasons put on table, and while I always support the PC, I couldnt really find any fault in their reasoning (but a few, but then, no opinion is always 100% perfect).<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>The tournament. </b></u><br/>
<br/>
We end up with 16 players, which is nice for a States. 4 of them were non-German, IIRC (Cedric from Netherlands, me from Italy, Tamàs from Hungary, and Stephan from Belgium), and all those were quality players. We had also some Germans who were very strong, only Nico was missing, due to personal issues.<br/>
I play EOPS Nizuc Blue, and HB Unique Wings.<br/>
Tamàs is playing Team IT Walkers (based on my EOPS), and old WYS space.<br/>
Andreas is playing CP Coruscant Jedi, and Imp Ent. (V). (a good DS deck, pretty tough. V18 will help even more, a lot)<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 1: EOPS Nizuc Blue vs. Cedric Vanderhaegens DBO (Netherlands) </b></u><br/>
Cedric is one of those very strong players, from Netherlands. He gave me fits in a pick-up game 30 minutes before, with me playing Invasion and him Jedi beatdown with Senate (V). He gets slops for playing DBO though (something I refused to play) and he agrees. It is important to note, that prior to this game, I hadnt the occasion or the time to test my DS vs. DBO, so while I had the match-up in my mind, Im far from assured to get a win. At all. <br/>
Cedric plays a version similar to Shannons one, same start, and it seemed same cards too. <br/>
I start the usual KDY(V), DIS(V), and AMSD(V). <br/>
Our first 2 turns are just deploying locations (systems for me, sites for him). Turn 3 I deploy Chiraneau to the Endor DB, with still a tons of Force active. I wait to see if he barriers, but he doesnt. I then deploy the Devastator (V) at Endor with Praji (V) (flashing him to get the ship, even though I have it in hand), play Levitation Attack (V) to get DSG(V) and Tractor beam, add Nizuc (V) there, and shuttle up Chiraneau to play AMSD nonV. Cedric just activates, drops EPP Luke, Leia RP, and Corran Horn to flip. He has 2 force left, so he moves Corran to Leias site, and passes.<br/>
The game continues for a while, and I manage to solidly occupy the the DB with B2(V), G. Veers (V), Elsek and Barich. So Im draining for free for 2, and direct damage him for 1, while hes paying to drain for 2, but Im cancelling one with Nizuc (V). <br/>
Soon after I flash Thrawn to get the Chimaera at Kessel, and put another Tractor Beam there, and a Droid Detector to the DB, while he puts Projection of a Skywalker on it. Im thus threatening a drain of 3 at Kessel, 2 at Endor, +1 DD at the DB.<br/>
He plays Menace Fades, drops a Y-W squadron with Lando Scoundrel at Naboo, while he plays Yoda MOTF(V) to another Dantooine site to increase his drains.<br/>
I just drain, deploy Lennox on Devastator (V) and move BOTH ships to Naboo. Im not flipped yet, so Lando would be adding a BD, but while I Droid Detector on the Bunker, I still need to get Derdram (V) who is hiding in the bottom of my force pile (2 turns in a row, missed the pull with Praji (V)) to flip.<br/>
Cedric has no other ships in hand, and its not like he can really contest me in space, so he looks where he can run without the Devastator following. Pity for him, theres no system which fits the bill. So he runs to Sullust. The Devastator (V) follows, leaving the Grand Amiral alone on Naboo.<br/>
My turn, I smile. I have the game in hand, and Cedric will get hit by a drain of 6. I activate all but 1. With all 1s out of my deck (ISD are destiny 2 due to DSG(V)), Im pretty confidant I can capture the Y-W squadron with only Our First Catch Of The Day. I see that Cedric has like 8 Force active, so he can cancel my interrupt with Yoda. <br/>
But still, I have 2 of them in hand, and theyre non-unique, so Im fine. However, the rotten luck alarm rings in my head, making me use Praji (V) just to check what destiny is in my reserve. Its the Tempest 1, the last destiny 1 remaining. I curse internally and then think it through. I use Lennox and play OFCOTD. Cedric cancels it with Yoda, sure enough. I play another one and he wished he had grabbed before cancelling (would have been a bad move, but he couldnt know). I play Flawless Marksmanship to add another 2. So I draw 5 total, Landos Squad is captured, and I then smile and announce the drain of 4 at Sullust due to Ominous Rumors &amp; Chiraneau (Menace Fades was no longer in effect). Cedric eats it and pulls Ultimatum shield. I drain for 2 at Naboo thanks to Chiraneau. <br/>
I then deploy Grond (V) on the Devastator (V), deploy U-3PO to a Dantooine site, and moves him to Dantooine. The Chimaera moves back to Endor to get the direct damage going. <br/>
Basically I cancel a drain with Nizuc, another one with Grond (V), and the 3rd one is taken care of with U-3PO, far away from Corran Horn.<br/>
Padme (V) was also direct damaging me for 1 a turn, so he wasnt really not doing anything. Some ping drains from time to time got through, and Padme damage also.<br/>
I however DB transit for free to Padmes location, and Trample her with a tracked 6. Cedric grabs wisely.<br/>
Leia RP joins B2(V) to blank the site, making me pay to drain, but I can afford it. I just move away B2(V) in front of Corran while Barich and Elsek just move out.<br/>
Time is running short, Im in control of the game, and Cedric makes a last attempt to get back into the game, by dropping a Y-W squadron with a guy aboard at Naboo, and HC&amp;F at Sullust.<br/>
I can however just loop Grond (V) with Praji (V) back to B2(V) instead of the Devastator (V) thus keeping drain cancelling, and move both ships to Naboo while deploying Tyrant to Dantooine, while I managed to flip eventually with Derdram (V). <br/>
I can Nizuc Bek the drain of 2 at Sullust, leaving HC&amp;F alone, while I just get 1 ping drain that I can retrieve (biker scout) with the objective.<br/>
Again, the Y-W squads moves, leaving me with a drain 2+2+2+1DD the next turn (due to the Y-W being again captured). Devastator and Chimaera <br/>
Time is called, Cedric shows the usual European sportsmanship and draws up his last 8 or so cards, giving me the full win by +18.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Props: </b><br/>
Cedric for drawing up (tactical decision he called it in a nice manner)<br/>
Lennox being the star<br/>
Yoda losing 2 force for nothing<br/>
DBO losing<br/>
Pretty tactical game <br/>
<br/>
<b>Slops: </b><br/>
DBOs activation ratio. WTF was the PC thinking ?<br/>
Brandon Schele: the DBO center ops site ? Never saw so many lines of broken text on one location. I guessed the creator before even looking at his name. It seems Mothma (V) wasnt enough of an example. <br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 2: HB Unique Wings vs. Dennis Senate. </b></u><br/>
Usually Senate screws HB, but then, this is because HB dont have often a lot of tech vs. Senate. I however start Scrambled Transmission (V), Squassin, and Rebel Planners. He starts a ground senate: a BG puller was in his starting effects.<br/>
Im fairly confident about this game, then. Dennis senate is basically playing Maul YA + saber on some heavy sites (3rd marker and Lars farm). <br/>
During all the game, we laughed and joked about the game, youll see some in between. ;-) He activates however only 4 turn 1, so it isnt helping, but he had a good hand, so he decides to Squabble for Orn Free Taa to deploy 2 senators there (Tikkes) and the Hovercam, getting more generation. <br/>
I just do my stuff, pulling the Alderaan BA, Aquaris, Luke in Ship, and moving it for the +3 activation. I also drop a Projection on his senate. So Dennis is activating now 8, while Im activating 10. He pulls and deploys the 3rd marker for more activation, and draws.<br/>
I ask him if he wants to play a shield, but he answers no. So I drain for 1, pull AWRI&amp;DS, drop Merc Sunlet (V), Ralltiir (Kashyyyk was hiding in my force pile), Kirdo III. I draw some.<br/>
Dennis in the meantime has been pulling Political Effects. He deploys Maul YA, use Blaster Racks for the saber, to the 3rd marker, threatening a drain 4 next turn. Could have been 6, but no drain adder political effect was on table. He plays then Battle Order. I make him grab AWRI&amp;DS to pull a ship.<br/>
I opt not to drain, try to pull another AWRI&amp;DS (miss) drop Red Sq. 7 with Derek on Rdvz Point, Red 7 and Elyhek Hue to Kirdoo III, pulling Sandwhirl. I deploy Kessel, and moves Derek there. I move Red 7 to Ralltiir. I flip.<br/>
So Dennis drain of 4 is gone, and he has now to pay to draw (hey, why dont you just draw up ? Hmmm, thanks, but no). He however is happy that I have finally flipped, so that he can try to deploy in space AND probe at the same time.<br/>
He plays 3 Political Effects (drain canceller is one of them), grabs and plays Lott Dodd with Squabble (I grab), Lars Farm, EPP vader there, and draws some. <br/>
My next turn I cancel the drain  canceller Pol. Eff. , and pay to drain for 6 (courtesy of Elyhek Hue at Ralltiir). I draw some while leaving some 5 cards active to prepare for the arrival of his space forces.<br/>
However, nothing terrible happens. Dennis is pulling cards with Lott Dodd and Tikkes to go around my objective (look, I have this utmost tech. Pay 3 to drain at the 3rd marker, and lose 1 to make it a 4!!! Uhhh. Thats a great idea, but Ill pass, thanks :D), but he gets only Mauls Sith Infiltrator with Evazan combo aboard to Kessel. I barrier. He probes, no luck.<br/>
I drain for 4, and then, thinks about a way to kill his ship. I have some 3 missing pairs of ships in hand. I search for AWRI&amp;DS, finding none. Dennis checks. I curses since none of the matching pairs are in the reserve. I look at Derek. This so-called great pilot actually sucks. I mean, look at him, he doesnt even draw BD!!!<br/>
However, I have an X-Wing Cannon in reserve, so I just draw it with Panic (V), and since all but 1-2 destinies there are 3+, I battle, shooting the Sith Infiltrator out of the sky. Dennis would have told me however later that he could have played C&amp;SFS to end the battle, however, with me having so much force active, he wouldnt have done it just for me playing a Cannon, I guess, so it wasnt such an error. Especially since I would have shot first if he had waited to play the interrupt in battle.<br/>
So Im still draining for 6, again, with Dennis drawing cards the next turn.<br/>
Finally I get Jek Porkins (V) on Kirdo III, pulling the Desert. I play also Red Leader In Red 1 to Ralltiir, and lands it to the just deployed Desert &amp; Sandwhirl.  My drain potential just upped to 8. I move Jek to Kashyyyk for more protection.<br/>
Dennis drops Saber 1 + Baron + Guns to Aquaris, where Luke is. He probes, no luck. He battles, I react with Panic, getting Keir + ship, and then playing TTFOAHC(V) for Blue Squadron 5 (V) + proton torpedoes. I add Organised Attack. Dennis is sighing. He shots out Blue Squad 5 (heroic FTW), while I pay 2 to play AWRI&amp;DS to get 6 as BD. When the smoke clears, the 2 XW are still there, and Baron and ships barely covered the battle damage.<br/>
The game continues for a while but theres nothing Dennis can do, and since I cant prevent him from drawing up (Lott Dodd), I win by +31 (only :p).<br/>
<br/>
4(+39)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Props: </b><br/>
Dennis and me for being funny guys to play with, I guess ^_^<br/>
HB for destroying Senate<br/>
Security Precautions for not showing up since no one plays HB anymore.<br/>
The Time For Our Attack Has Come (V), who allowed me to pull Blue Squad 5 (V) to save my ship. :-) What a great card it is!!! I wonder WHO created it!!! :-p<br/>
Scrambled Transmission (V): GG Senate!!!<br/>
HB unique matching pilots being tournament viable!<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Merc Sunlet (V): not really needed, but then, this is because I never lost a card to a drain and I was winning, so I guess its not the cards fault.<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 3: HB Unique Wings vs. Andreas Holtmanns Imperial Entanglements (V) </b></u><br/>
Awww So I have to play a partner. Geeez. 16 players, and Andreas is 2nd just behind me in the pairings. That impresses me, since I wasnt expecting him to win his first 2 games (not in a row, since there was some pretty though opposition ; heck, I wasnt even positive I would have been able to do it myself, since I was rusty too). <br/>
We had tested the match-up the day before, and Andreas had won it with +2. However, last time, I wasnt able to find Luke until turn 6, so here, I hope it will be better.<br/>
Like Chris Menzel told me, he has a pretty good DS version of Entanglements, and I know it. We even made him make some last minute changes, like taking out Emperor Palpatine and Force Lightning to put at least 1 Brief Loss Of Control (V), which was key in his deck for multiple reasons.<br/>
The game starts, and Andreas plan is to get 4 sites down instead of 3, to drain for more while he probes. Since however he knows my HB marker, Ive thought about switching it. We talk about it for a while, and I tell him that I have, indeed, another marker. I was trying to see if I could fake a marker switch with Rebel Planners, but no. In the end, I start with Kessel as HB indicator.<br/>
I get Luke in starting hand, and the game seems to go well into my favor.<br/>
I basically get my activation going turn 1, and then turn 2 moves all 3 X-W (counting Wedge RSL) to Tatooine, threatening a beatdown there.<br/>
Andreas has no choice than to deploy 2 vehicles to his sites, getting Vader for free, shuttling him up, and moves away, to Aquaris.<br/>
I flip the turn after, exchanging also my HB indicator with Kirdo III (the original one, to bluff him out) and threaten a drain of a bunch. <br/>
He probes Aquaris, no luck.<br/>
Details get foggy then, but I remember me preventing him to flip for one more turn, by landing Derek in ship to the Desert Heart. When he fights and battles, Its A Trap! deals with it, and since he already grabbed Its A Hit! , he is stuck and doesnt clear the site to flip.<br/>
I then drain for free, retrieves Its A Trap!, while Gold 1 (V) pulls some cards every turn. I have an Houjix in hand, but I want something else: I play NOOOOOOOOOOOO!(V) to find the other Its A Trap!. Bad luck, its in reserve. <br/>
He has Devastator (V) and another ship at Tatooine vs. 3 of my X-Wings (Red 7, Red 5, Red Sq. 1). When he battles at the site, I Hyper Escape away to the system. I then play TTFOAHC(V) to get Blue 5 there, threatening to hit the Devastator (V). <br/>
Nico (who arrived to say hi) would then say it wasnt a legal move (Hyper Escape works only at a system), and he was right. He tells this 1 turn later, and I feel bad about it.<br/>
So even with another Its A Trap! in hand, I profusely make some apologies, and houjix Derek away to make it more fair. <br/>
Andreas is having bad luck finding the system, going to Kessel, then Kashyyyk, then he understand it must be Kirdo III, and while he gains a turn because I scrub out by moving a ship from Kashyyyk to Ralltiir, allowing him to follow and probe, he still needs to probe fast, so he drops Black 2 with pilot to Kirdo III, putting OOP my objective. He cant however move away from there, so he moves the Devastator there. He still get a drain of 1 there due to Chiraneau.<br/>
Now I start losing some more drains, since I cant find my 2nd Projection, so its like 3 damage a turn minimum, while he tries to cover most of my big drains. I get to retrieve however with Jek (V) and Luke (V), so Im still in the lead, too much to use Merc Sunlet (V) anyway. To prevent him from draining too much, I have basically to put some heavy opposition in front of the Devastator (V), while trying to drain far away. I manage to redeploy Derek in ship, landing him back to a Tatooine site. Gold 1 (V) loops then, for the rest of the game, Its A Trap!.<br/>
Time is called, and its not very clear who would have won. I was surely in the lead, but Andreas had flipped, and he could then pick whatever card he wanted from the top of his reserve deck.<br/>
So we count cards, I win by more, so I get the Time Win.<br/>
<br/>
5(+65ish)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Props: </b><br/>
HB winning the game, I knew it was doable.<br/>
Hard fought game<br/>
Still unbeaten! <br/>
<br/>
<b>Slops: </b><br/>
Me for cheating inadvertently. <br/>
Gold 1 (V) + Its A Trap!<br/>
ICBW for eluding me all game.<br/>
Playing a teammate <br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 4: EOPS Nizuc Blue vs. Tamàs Papps WYS<b></b></b></u><br/>
Again ?<br/>
I mean, I didnt travel all the way to play a teammate! The good news is that the match-up is, on paper, way better than with switched sides (HB vs. Walkers would be difficult to say the least).<br/>
So I ask Tamàs if he wants to concede the game, and play another fun game instead. He declines, but smiles.<br/>
Boy  I was wrong. I nearly lost that game, and won it only at the last turns.<br/>
Ok, let me get that straight. Ive played vs. WYS space a lot. And I knew it was a hard match-up. I dont know why, but I forgot it. I mean, the match-up is in favor of EOPS, for sure, but you have to claw your way back to win it. Its not easy at all. WYS can kill your AMSD nonV easily. They can AWRI&amp;DS past your destiny limitation. And its WYS: tons of tricks.<br/>
Our game starts like 10 minutes later because Tamàs was speaking to Nico (he was going back home).<br/>
Good news is: I know Tamàss deck list (less than he knows mine, but still), and I know I can basically play Nizuc Bek (V) at the Bunker to flip turn 1 since he plays no spies or IL-9. And so I did.<br/>
Then of course he starts quicker than me, and flips with smugglers in the cantina, and Outrider at a drain 2 system. <br/>
I manage to get out the Devastator (V), and play Look Sir Droids (V) to block the Cantina drain. Im not finding any Juri Juice, however.<br/>
The Devastator (V), however, is all alone with Praji (V) at Kessel, with another pilot aboard (dont remember which one), and the immunity is only &lt;6 with the AO. <br/>
Kessel is converted by him (classic move, but I needed the icons). He gets some drains, and the Tyrant drops to Naboo (I think Outrider was there) and gets barriered. I had Elsek aboard for free, and moves the Devastator (V) over for back up. Lennox is aboard it, and Tractor Beam is operational. However, I have no OFCOTD or Flawless M. <br/>
Tamàs however has no other ship in hand (or he has, but he misses the Squassin pulls). So he runs away to Kessel again.<br/>
I follow, use Praji (V) (showing me that few destinies can get the Outrider with the beam in the control phase, but like 90% would get it with In Range) and drop Conquest (V) + Grond (V) there. He tells me that he will draw a 6, so its better not to do it. :D<br/>
Sure sure. I battle, and I try In Range, and of course I miss. <br/>
He plays the interrupt that makes the Outrider power +2 and immune to attrition. We both draw destinies, and he draws a blind 6. -_-<br/>
I clear the Outrider plus 4 overflow, but I still have to lose either 2 key pilots, either Conquest and Grond (V). Since I have 2 Conquest and Grond (V) isnt very useful, I chose the latter. <br/>
Tyrant moves back to back up.<br/>
The game goes on, and I eventually find a Juri Juice, while Tamàs is drawing blind 6s every time (he shuffles the deck, and Im cutting, so I know theyre blind 6s), killing the Tyrant eventually. <br/>
He has more life force, and time is called. I ask for some more minutes, since we basically didnt play the game at the start, and Andreas says is it my problem ? but then basically we got them.<br/>
I eventually manage to lock him down: hes not draining anymore, and I have Chimaera + Thrawn AND Devastator (V) fully loaded in front of his 2 ships. AWRI&amp;DS was grabbed. He pondered a while. He knew that running away would have meant me capturing any one ship at the bare minimum, while blocking his drain, etc. He dropped another ship, and played Flash (V). We knew he had a 1, a 4, and 2 5s in reserve. A 4 appeared. He battled, adding a destiny to power with Red 10. A 1 appeared on top of his reserve deck. I captured one of his ships with In Range, and he used Mirax to take the 1, getting a 5. Damned, I should have captured Mirax.<br/>
However, even with AWRI&amp;DS, he just kills Thrawn + ship, while I clear the system, and captures a lone outrider.<br/>
I drain for a bunch the next turns with another Conquest, so when the time is called again, he draws up. <br/>
Thanks Tamàs!<br/>

Tamàs for drawing up and continuing the game (ok, he could even have won with a FW, but I guess I got the better out of it)<br/>
EOPS for working again vs. WYS space.<br/>
Tamàs for predicting all his blind 6s<br/>
A hell of a game<br/>

<u><b>Game 5: EOPS Nizuc Blue vs. Dirk Friedrichs DBO</b></u><br/>
Meh.<br/>
DBO again.<br/>
Dirk Dirk what are you playing ? You were playing always nice decks before hand!<br/>
He apologizes too about it.<br/>
His start is different: hes playing Sonns SI. So I start Endor Shield (V) instead of AMSD(V).<br/>
It turns out a good choice.<br/>
Turn 1 he just pulls a site and draws. Considering his DBO is slower in flipping, I think I have a better chance than Game 1.<br/>
I pull systems, and the same thing happens.<br/>
He eventually flips while I have Devastator (V), Praji (V), Chiraneau and AMSD nonV at Endor. <br/>
I had however the 2 Blizzard 2 (V) in hand, and Dirk, fearing a non-unique ISD beatdown, Grimtaash lost me for the 2 AT-ATs. This proved to be game breaking, because I couldnt find ANY of my FOUR Levitation Attacks (V).<br/>
So when I eventually found a Force Push (V), I had to decide between getting Tempest 1 for locking a site, or a Levitation Attack (V). Point is: I play FOUR, so I chose Tempest 1.<br/>
Well, I never, ever, drew a Levitation Attack (V), not even by tracking stupid destinies, and losing like 20 cards from the life force. It was pretty funny (not). I got hit then by a Y-W swarm attack (Org Att, I grab) at Dantooine since I was trying to cancel his drains with Grond (V).<br/>
This made me lose Thrawn, a biker scout and some 3-4 cards to battle damage (I drew a 1 and 2 for destiny, again, awful luck). I still steeled myself to claw my way back into the game, and the Devastator (V) tried, with other ships, to clear Dirks space, even without Tractor Beams. I managed slowly, since he was bluffing having other Org. Att. in hand. When I found finally a Levitation attack, it was cancelled by Yoda. The last 3 were in my 5 cards Life Force. So a battle that would have made me win the game (tractor, in range, get a X-W squad for more power) turned out in another 2 turns slow down. I eventually managed to get Lev Attack while preventing some drains and losing cards from hand, but it was too late.<br/>
By the time I had the game locked down, and him having no more ships, he was draining for 1 a turn (since I was cancelling drains), and me 2 or 3, but he had like 16 cards left to my 4. Time was called, so I just told him to battle me and that I would not forfeit Elsek to Ghhhk away, so that he could get the Full Win.<br/>
<br/>
7 (+65ish)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Props: </b><br/>
Funny game vs. Dirk too. We had jokes during it. I always like playing vs. him.<br/>
Him finally beating me in a tournament.<br/>
EOPS being still sound, but you cant do anything vs. bad luck, I guess.<br/>
I predicted I would lose 1 game (at least) in this tournament. I guess I was right. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Slops: </b><br/>
Not always the logical choice is the good one. Getting Levitation Attack (V) sooner would have been better, since Tempest 1 never actually hit the table, since I wasnt drawing any of my other biker scouts, and he was playing Jedi Presence.<br/>
DBO. See game 1 for the same slops.<br/>
<br/>
So pairings are made. Im in position 3 due to my Time Win.<br/>
There are 2 players with 8 VP (Dirk and Cedric).<br/>
Im at 7 VPs, and I play Ben who is at 6 VPs.<br/>
Tamàs is right behind at spot #5 and he has to play Angelo, with his WYS however (a deck he doesnt feel very well about).<br/>
Funny thing is that Angelo was basically 2-2 after game 4, so hes getting back at the top tables.<br/>
I have a great differential, so for a moment I think that if I Time Win, Im in no matter what. Then I see Angelos differential, which is EVEN bigger than mine. Ugh. Ok, Ill have to FW my way out of this one, then. <br/>
<br/>
<u><b>Game 6: HB Unique Wings vs. Benjamin Jacobs TDIGWATT heavy space</b></u><br/>
When I look at the objective, I think WTF??? and since Ive heard people speaking about DDeal in this tournament, I think well, thats it.<br/>
I try to understand how to play that one, and in the end, I figure out I have some pretty good chances.<br/>
Ben is a returning player, one that was really good (wasnt he a World Champion too ? Or is it another Ben ?). The deck, he didnt create it, but built it from a list online (Retarded Retwin).<br/>
I start Merc Sunlet (V) as usual.<br/>
He started a 2/1 interior site, so he activates 3, drops a system with KDY(V) (Bespin), the B:CC with the objective and draws all.<br/>
I do my stuff, getting the 2/0 system and Luke in ship at Aquaris.<br/>
He drops another system (I guess Naboo) and draws.<br/>
My brain is actually sleeping, but I dont know it yet. I mean, Im still thinking hes playing Dark Deal, and for some reasons uses KDY(V) to pull Bespin turn 1, which is highly illogical if you think about it.<br/>
I drain for 1 (for free), and gets AWRI&amp;DS. Since however he deployed another system (Naboo), my last brain cells still working are trying to warn me that something is amiss. So I understand that maybe he plays also some space, so I drop Wedge in ship at Kirdo III to pull the Desert, and moves him to Aquaris for back-up.<br/>
This apparently saves me, because he just ponders things, drops another system and draws some more, getting like a 18 card hand.<br/>
Uh-Oh <br/>
Some other of my brain cells start to re-activate, and I remember now Dirks words, about him getting stomped by a pile of non-unique ISDs.<br/>
My blood freezes, and suddenly Luke and Wedge do not seem so strong anymore.<br/>
I drain again for 1, and he loses it over the top (Lateral Damage) which makes my fears come true. I get the other AWRI&amp;DS. I see that Grimtaash is in my Reserve. But Escape Pod (V) is not. So I get Red 7 with AWRI&amp;DS (grabbed), pull Elyhek Hue to Kirdo III to pull Sandwhirl, and moves him to Acquaris to protect his leaders.<br/>
I then draws hopping for the best. I get the Escape Pod (V), plays it during his turn for a Grimtaash, and when I plays it, he says yeah, I have more than 12. But I play it Lost, getting 3 non-unique ISD, 2 Retwin, 2 AO. Speak about a huge play.<br/>
Thats basically game right there, since he basically has to draw again, while I just deploy Kessel and flip, while deploying Red Leader In Red 1 and landing him at a Desert with a Sandwhirl.<br/>
He deploys the Chimaera for 8 (DIS(V) is NOT working), and Thrawn, but I barrier Thrawn. He probes and miss, and moves to another system.<br/>
While I retrieve back Grimtaash, hes getting drained a lot, so the card is basically useless.<br/>
In the end, he mounts a comeback, since he eventually manages to have 4 ships, and I cant really afford to run anymore, since he has also Retwin to drain for free. <br/>
When he battles, however, I Panic (V) and Organised Attack there, killing and hitting a ship, while I lose Blue 5 due to his destiny 5. Pity I had too many life force to Collision his ships, so the tracked 0 or 7 was 4 cards down.<br/>
He is the one then spreading out, but I just spread out to block his drains too.<br/>
When he battles, I have 2 Organised Attack in hand (Courtesy of Gold 1 (V)), so I just lose some few cards to battle damage, while he loses like 2 ship (1 ran away with Hyper escape).<br/>
There is really nothing he can do, so since he managed eventually to find the HB locator, he draws up. <br/>
<br/>
9(+97)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Props: </b><br/>
HB not losing a single game! Woot!<br/>
Grimtaash: I rarely play this card, but it turned out crucial<br/>
Ben being a nice opponent<br/>
Ben for playing a off-the-wall deck<br/>
Im in the Finals!!!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Slops: </b><br/>
None really.<br/>
<br/>
 So Im 2nd, and Dirk is first, since he won the game vs. Cedric!<br/>
What a surprise!<br/>
A good one, because I love Dirk.<br/>
People tell me however that hes been a real better player from 2 years from now, winning also the Germany Regionals 2 years ago.<br/>
Ugh, ok, thats why. :-D<br/>
However, Dirk scrubbed out on the organization part, since he has his train like  20 minutes from now ?<br/>
So he cant play.<br/>
We talk a while about it. I dont want to cheat him out of the title, but I really want to play. We even consider Angelo playing his decks for a while, but the TD rules that out. He tells me that his Dark Deal would probably lose vs. my HB, since I can cancel 2 of his drains (and actually, I have also 2 A Vergence In The Force, but he doesnt know), and killed him out of space and CC sector, and that a rematch vs. DBO would probably go into my favor, so he just concedes.<br/>
With this, Im crowned Ralltiir Champion, getting a nice BIG cup!!!<br/>
Finally, Im no more Mr. 2nd place.<br/>
I give my boosters, as always, to the last player (a nice German called Mat). Some boosters are pretty cool, since we have also Dagobah and Reflection III !<br/>

Patrick Dinelle, for the switch of blizzard 1 (V) for Tempest 1 (V), and the 3rd Nizuc Bek (V) for Force Push (V). (albeit I know this sentence will get me booooh from many, Dinelle never did anything against me, and has always been helping, so I give the guy credit where its due, its the least  and honest  thing I can do)<br/>

Tamàs for not managing to date a girl that was basically drooling for him (once she understood I was off-limits since I was married). Him getting drunk in the process didnt help either. :-p Well make an Isabella (V) card soon enough, dont worry! :D<br/>
