<br>
San Diego Mega Tournament: Part 2<br>
<br>
For Part 1, including sealed deck play and pre-tournament awesomeness, read If you give a Bubo a Queso<br>
<br>
I wake up, eat breakfast, and start frantically pulling my decks together.  I lost all my extra v-sheets in transit so I had to hunt down a bunch of v-slips for my decks.  I dont have my list for CRV so Im converting from Hunt Down via my head with nothing to look at, so I just put cards in until I get to sixty and then change a few.  I dont have a reference handy which means that my list has someinteresting choices.  I had originally planned to run space beats with ZiMH/4-LOM/Lat Damage, but decided not to due to time constraints.  Light was the aforementioned Combat, with Luke SITF pwning fools even if Im flipped.  Padme pulling him every turn also allowed for awesome hit-and-run possibilities.  At this point Im not feeling great about my deck choices, I havent tested and have no idea how lots of my match-ups go, and Ive hardly played in a while so Im just hoping to win a few games so as not to disgrace myself.  Some nice easy match-ups early would be good, and then I can commence losing.  So Mr. Schoenthal calls out the pairings and Im matched up withKevin Shannon.<br>
<br>
Game #1:  Light Combat against Kevin Shannon CRV<br>
In deciding to play Combat, my main source of consternation was not knowing what would happen against CRV.  I cant battle (well, in most cases), hes playing a battling deck, and hes out-activating me two to one.  That didnt sound like a recipe for success.  Starting off with a game in an unknown match-up, against the reigning World Championeesh!  Still, first rule of Star Wars Cards: I have never lost to the name on a command card, only to the deck played by said player.  Time to knuckle down and wait and see what happens.  He starts Gift Of The Master, Establish Control, and something else that I cant remember.  All I know is it was NOT Ability ^3 v.  I think it was Phantom Menace, actually.  This wasnt that surprising as I had cut the card from my own since it wasnt doing much to Senate anymore.  Still, that changes the match-up since his destinies arent amazing so I should be able to combat some Jedi off the table.  I go with my standard start of Rycar Ryjerd v, Quick Draw v, and Wokling v.  He just draws the first turn, as do I.  I think I got the early BNChambers and Threepio going, which is good, and I got out SaiTor.  Turn two he comes down with Lord Sidious and saber at his 2/1 site.  He didnt have a ton of extra activation going beyond Fondor, so hes not activating ridiculously at this point.  I responded with Qui-Gon JM, Obi JK, both with Sabers, at my 3/2, draw a couple, and wait for the response.  He brings the noise with Maul YA and Dr. E combo to the 3/2, but I use Obi so he misses and then I chop chop Dr. E.  He Force Fields my swing, so we draw destinies and dudes dont die.  He eventually puts out ZiMH to Fondor so hes getting in some drains, Im combating frequently so hes taking heavy damage.  Eventually I get Luke SITF + Leia at my site and we both ended up Disarming fools and killing Jedi.  I did screw up one turn when he Disarms Luke and chops both Luke and Leia and I dont draw high enough so he clears my site after I got 1-2 drains of 3 off.  He had Palpatine at the other site, but I combat him lost.  Were starting to run short on time since were both taking our time to avoid mistakes.  Eventually Im up probably 17 or so to 7 with two 7s tracked so I can Combat Maul lost and block his Arica Drain (he put her at the 3/2 with Maul still patrolling the 2/2), and we wrap at time with me winning by 12.<br>
FW 2 +12<br>
<br>
Theres a field of 14 players, so I figure thats a smallish win, and I was right.  Sounds good, keep the diff low, and I just played Kevin so it can only get easier from here.  And the pairings come out, Im facingKevin Shannon.<br>
<br>
Game #2: CRV against Kevin Shannon DBO<br>
For freaking serious?!?  Two games in a row to start against the best player in SWCCG over the past year and a half.  Ive got my work cut out for me.  I put him on either DBO or WYS, and he flips over DBO and I am moderately pleased.  I would get owned by WYS, I really do not have to tools to wreck it without a beatdown.  My deck is structured, however, to be very prepared for DBO.  I have YCHF for Sec Prec v, Blast Door Controls, and was going to run x2 Stop Motion v except I couldnt find them before the tourney.  I know the key is to get all over his sites and try to get some beatdowns in before his space drains cripple me.  To force interaction early, I had added Ability ^3 NON-v to start against DBO, WYS, and some other potential match-ups if I thought it would work to my advantage.  It earned its slot.<br>
	Kevin shows Theyre On Dantooine v, Wokling v, and Insurrection &amp; Aim High.  I have IAO/Secret Plans and Gift Of The Master (always start these two) and AAA.  I just activate, play a db, and draw a couple of cards.  His first turn consists of thinking, getting the swamp, making sure AAA is canceled if he puts out a character, and puts Leia RP to the Swamp for his 4 force.  It worked.  I lucked into Blast Door Controls, though I also had an Accelerate to help out.  Ive got Palps, Dr E combo, x2 EPP Maul, EPP Mara, BDC, and some red.  I activate, draw like 2, and say go.  He activates 6, thinks for a while, pulls a site and a db, and Grimtaashes lost.  Ouch, there go two Mauls.  But he also sees my hand, and all he can do is draw, saving 1.  I accelerate for No Escape in his draw phase.  My turn, BDC, Dr. E combo, No Escape for Maul, Maul, battle for 4 at the Swamp, thats Leia and thirteen and I lose Dr. E combo, Maul takes over the 2/1 site.  In the overflow he lost a Narrow Escape from hand.  I think he comes down with EPP Qui-Gon on Maul but we just clear the site, either he missed or I Force Fielded.  Next turn I put Palpatine at the 2/1.  He lost a fifth site at some point, but did pull out the fourth.  He has a small hand and has to reload.  I put out Sidious and saber to the 2/1 and pick up more cards.  He comes down at a couple sites, I get DVDLOTS with Darth Vaders Lightsaber v to his Spaceport DB.  Without BG systems or a way to flip theres virtually nothing he can do, so I just keep draining for 2-4-6 a turn and kill his last few dudes, ending up with a win by 26.<br>
FW 4 +38<br>
<br>
Ummm, I just started 2-0 against the World Champ.  It can only go downhill from here.  Nice to know I can still play with something resembling competence :D  I definitely got lucky, the match-ups were good and I drew the tools to get the job done.  I also won big so now I'm going to have to play more solid players it would seem.  Oh well, the price of success I guess.<br>
<br>
Game #3: CRV against Aaron Nelsons 3/2(!)<br>
<br/>
We have a good chuckle over this match-up, and it is then that I remember something exciting about my decklist.  I have no Luke, Luuuuke v.  Crap.  I start the two standard effects and opt forCrush as the third, I think.  Or maybe Justice v.  Dont recall for sure.  He gets a quick start with Boss Nass Chambers, I put out Lord Vader turn 1 to get some pressure going at the 3/2 site.  He responds with Leia RP to the Chambers, I elect to draw some cards and send him to chase her.  Aaron then deploys Luke SITF(!) to the 3/2 site w/Saber, Harvests up the Journal, and moves Leia over.  Dang.  I had talked with Kyle Krueger about playing 3/2 with Luke SITF a couple months prior but hadnt actually built one.  So now I cant play I Have You Now, I cant Maul Strikes, Dr. E will just get owned, I cant persona replace with DLOTS to track and choke Luke, and Im getting drained for 4 a turn.  Im in a tight spot.  Heres where my rustiness begins to show its face.  I should have drawn to find a You Are Beaten and proceeded to beat Leia down with I Have You Now and multiple characters, but I just can not find the goods.  I do eventually get You Are Beaten, but he reinforces shortly thereafter with Padme and Yoda before I can do anything with it.  I got Vader and a Maul killed, and eventually do clear some characters by attacking with DLOTS and Mara to choke Leia, whack Padme used, and get Yoda gone (Deflected my swing on him), but I lose all my guys so Luke is still there, and hes reinforced by Mace and theres nothing left for me to do but lose by 25.<br/>
FL 4 +13<br/>
<br/>
I definitely made some mistakes in the way I attacked that deck, but Aaron knew exactly what to do.  In hindsight, I should have set up Sidious immediately and started drain racing for a bit with superior activation until my hand was more set up.  But thats hindsight for you.  <br/>
<br/>
That should get me into the low end of the 2-1's, so hopefully I can get some easier games here soon.  Or not.<br/>
<br/>
Game #4: LSC versus Tom McGee's Invasion<br/>
This match-up seemed interesting; I wasnt sure how it would go.  I had lost to this deck the previous night with WYS, but Combat has much better tools for this kind of game.  I start default three effects, he goes Look Sir Droids for At Last We v and Combat Response.  He gets out Guri/Stinger/Daulty turn 1, a site, and draws.  I put Obi JK at the 3/2 and draw.  He flips with Nute and a couple droids on turn two, but I go and start fighting over the throne room.  We skirmish for a while (I grabbed Oh Switch Off, which was mistake on my part) but I eventually take control with Im with You Too and Immunity giving me staying power.  Hes spread out with droids so were trading drains, but once I flip him back hes paying for the privilege as well and cant kill my guys effectively.  The games really close until he moves a Droid in front of Threepio w/parts showing at Boss Nass Chambers.  I respond with Leia RP and battle.  Tom wants to Outflank, but it is ruled that the total power from Naboo system (+2) is in effect as soon as the battle is initiated so he is unable to play it, so I kill the droid and force a few overflow, have Leia to cancel some drains, and then we just shuffle dudes and fight for the last few turns.  I whittle him down to win by ten.<br/>
FW 6 +23<br/>
<br/>
Three and one, but with low diff so Im hoping to win three more; then it wont matter.  I have to get an easy game sometime, right?<br/>
<br/>
Game #5: LSC against Aaron Nelsons Invasion<br/>
Woohoo, exact same game I just played.  But, I know that the last game was very close because of all the fighting and him draining so I decide to try a different approach and drain race for a while until he starts to run out of battling cards.  Sound like a bad idea?  It was.  I got the early Obi, he got Guri/Stinger/Daulty.  He did pull the Stinger with Those Rebels v instead of Look Sir Droiding, so his third effect was 3,7201 to 1 v.  Which I canceled by starting Insight over Rycar :D  He did flip stronger than Tom, with 4 guys and a droid.  I couldnt find Mace, and didnt want to use Qui-Gon because then he could drop Maul and put me in a potentially bad situation, and didnt think Luke and Padme could handle it by themselves.  Since hes flipped, he can battle much more effectively than Tom in the previous game, so there is much infighting and hes draining for free.  Drawing near to the late game, he has a couple droids in front of Padme and a couple dudes and Nute at the throne room.  I put Luke down, check my reserve of about fifteen cards, and I have two 1s and a pile of 5/6/7s.  I figure Ill come down, add destiny to attrition with Luke and kill those droids, then battle with Padme and clear those.  There will be zero dudes at sites, and I have another Luke and a Qui-Gon in hand with sabers I can pull.  So battle with luke, add to attrition (a 5) and draw bd.  Mace Windu.  Dang.  Oh well, still killed two.  Battle with Padme.  Luke SITF stares up at me from my reserve deck.  Well, thats that.  I then get drained for 6 and put a couple more dudes down but hes draining big for free and reinforcing so thats pretty much it.  I lose by 15<br/>
FL 6 + 8<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, now I have to 3-0 out to finish 6-2, that means I better start winning big.  Easy match-up coming in 321.<br/>
<br/>
Game #6: CRV against Brian Freds TIGIH<br/>
Really?! Yes, that is correct: out of my first 6 games, all of my opponents were top 5 at Origins and top 5 in San Diego.  For serious.  Brian and Kevin actually both start 0-2 so theyve been clawing their way back up to the top tables, were both 3-2.  Normally I would like this match-up, but there were two problems with that.  One, I dont have Luke, Luuuke so if we drain race he can actually do some damage to me.  Two, I cant draw a Maul for the first many turns of the game.  Brian thought for a while and ended up starting Signal for Goo.  I went with defaults + Crush, I think.  I Force Pushed into a Vader on my second turn so I could chop his activation, but he dies to a Smoke Screen.  I dont want to throw out Sidious and were neither of us activating very much, so I just try and get some decent red/characters in my hand.  Eventually I get out Vader and Maul to his DB; he has Qui-Gon and Yoda at my Office draining for two.  I spread out Maul to the hut to drain for more and we exchange drains for a couple turns, but he eventually has Obi JK who offs Vader (I think he deflected the swing and I drew too low w/Justice) so hes in control.  I bring Maul over to fight but dont save enough destinies to make him pay for battling me with one in his reserve.  If Id thought it through, I could have Maul Strikes dueled Obi with my destiny against his, then I play I Have You Now and overflowed Luke despite Im With You Too, but I didnt, and forgot Obi could cancel my draw so my four destinies (I added with Maul Strikes) ended up totaling 4 and Maul dies and I think I hit one of the dudes but it wasnt enough.  I lose shortly thereafter by 16.<br/>
FL 6  8<br/>
<br/>
Practice is good, why didnt I?  Poor decisions definitely hindered me, but Brian played it excellently so I dont know that I could have done much more.  At least I should get something resembling an easier match-up now.  Must win by a million.<br/>
<br/>
Game #7: LSC against John Veasey<br/>
Finally, a game where I have the advantage!  Now it is a little dicy-er because I dont run SAC, but between Luke and Proficiency, Lando, and all my dudes being forfeit a billion Im pretty well set to combat huge power.  He start Info Exchange/Ket/Scum, I go Insight so I can pull Honor early.  He gets Rystall to the 1/0 coru db turn 1, but doesnt move Shada over.  I put down Qui-Gon to the 3/2 and deploy BNC.  He pulls the spaceport DB, moves Shada and Rystall over and added a third character.  I drop Luke and Padme to the 3/2, Luke gets Im With You Too and Qui-Gon is Proficient.  He Eliss to the 3/2 (Im expecting the Cease Fire now), drops a pile o ladies plus 3b3-10 v, and battles.  No Cease Fire(!).  I swing at 3b3 but get Oh Switch Offd, as expected.  But he forgets that lets me swing at Shada, so I do and send her used.  I add a destiny to power and draw well for both so I end up losing by only a few (canceled a destiny w/IWYT), so Padme covers.  He doesnt have enough to retrieve, so I then battle back for big overflow with Obi and three sabers so he has two little pansies to my huge power.   He puts down more at the DB, Mace goes to fight and gets YPAWOMd, but doesnt take serious damage from the exchange (though I do forfeit him, so I just lose 3 to cancel the BD).  With super Luke down, a Run Luke Run beatdown enacted, and Padme going he cant stem the tide and I win by 30.<br/>
FW 4 + 22<br/>
<br/>
That helped, but I still need a huge win + some help to make the cut.  But Im paired with Clayton Atkin, so I know that will be no easy task.<br/>
<br/>
Game #8: CRV against Clayton Atkins TRM<br/>
This was an awesome game!  Pretty much the only prep I did for this tournament as far as gameplay was concerned was reading through a ton (and I mean a TON) of TR's by top players, especially from back in the day with detailed game reports.  Hence, I had read through all of Clay's tournament reports and was able make jokes about cards I expected to see.  I start Wipe Them Out v as my third effect to his Wokling/Insurrection &amp; Aim High/DTF.  I get started right away with Sidious and actually got out AAA fairly early into the game.  He gets Tantive and stuff out fairly early as well, so we're just trading drains and fighting over his Battle Plains as I locked up my site with Sidious/Palps/Janus/Dr. E combo or something to that effect.  I also got to use Wipe Them out for extra activation and retrieval to try and keep my diff up.  He killed DLOTS, Lord Vader, Maul, the Blizzard 4, we had tons of battles all over the site.  I think I got a You Are Beaten beatdown in for a few cards with Vader/B4 against Qui-Gon and Mace when I YAB'd Mace, but that could be wrong.  We just cleared the site every turn so I never got to drain there but he was never left with presence.  Wipe them Out was saving my dudes half the time, except for when I forgot it in a Lord Vader v EPP Luke fight :P  That might have upped my win by a few force, but not enough to get me into the top 4.  I had the tempo from early on and didn't relinquish so it was pretty clear who was going to win, but we just kept draining and fighting and having a grand old time.  Eventually my drain and AAA turn the screws too deep and he relinquishes his last lifeforce.  I win by 19.<br/>
<br/>
FW 8 + 41<br/>
<br/>
I come in 6th place, as Casey wins his last game to get to 6-2 (with diff that was ten below mine at the start of the last round :P) and Bfred has two more differential than me.  Kevin Shannon recovers to come in 5-3 with better diff, making the cut, and Tom and Aaron are both 6-2.  All things considered, I didn't do too poorly for myself.  I'll save the Saturday night wrap-up and Sunday report (with multiple EPIC games) for another report to be released as soon as I write it up. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
