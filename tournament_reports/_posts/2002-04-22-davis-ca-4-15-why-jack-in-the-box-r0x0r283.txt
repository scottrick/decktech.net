<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament from Davis 4-15 Its kinda late since this week was hell so dont review saying oh oh this was a week late.<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
Fresh off the dissapointing performance from last weekend I am eager to hit up another tourny as soon as I can.  But things are looking grim as there is only 1 this weekend(Sunday) but 2, 2 weekends from this one.  I just decide to wait for the two in a row which would be awesome and get me back into this.  Ive been talking to Clay lately and I during the week him and Kevin(and as many other people they can get) are planning on hitting up this Davis tourny while Kevins on leave.  So we make arragements but nothing really is for sure till Sunday at 10.  Well the week drags on and I slowly work on decks.  Senate was my favorite choice but I needed 1 squabbling to make it work fast.  So I throw it together and test it a few times and it seems alright maybe a little off my style but it was nice.  I have it set up with manip which Ive wanted to play since I got into this game and I finally do.  Mimminoy and Def fire obj and Limited resources seems like a good idea and it seems good.  The light side for now seems good and I change a Blaster Deflection for another Speak with Council(2 now) and man did it make the deck a machine.  I never realized how good it was to get opening hand with Qui, Goo Nee and the Chamber.  Saturday I give Clayton my number for Kev and get to sleep around 1 or 2 after play DoD(addictive as hell if your into WW2 as much as I am).  Great half life mod I love it.  Anyways.  I wake up and tune the dark side a little and Kevin calls and we corridinate things and everything is good to go.  I meet them in a parking lot close to 11 and were off.  Very uneventful trip just talking about old times and old decks blah blah.  We arrive in Davis EARLY OMFG STFU!!!! early...... but Kevin says whoa we can still get lost..... but we dont shucks.  Theres about 8 people there counting us and everything gets set up and were off.  <br>
<br>
Decks<br>
DS:  Senate THUNDA<br>
LS:  Combat that 0wnz everything<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
DS vs Kevin "wheres jack in the box" Shannons Senate Gungans<br>
<br>
Well 2 weeks in a row 2 weeks Kevin first game.  Oh well what you gonna do right?  We start off and I get a rather slow start getting docking bays out and drawing for more senators since I only play 9(good vs some senate decks but Kevs got like 22 Characters with politics in his deck).  He sets up the gungan stuff going preety fast with Nass, Rep Been and the other site first turn.  The game is mostly senate battles but I dont want to list them all out cause i dont remember most of them and there was alot.... like 1 on my turn 1 on his turn and so on.  We have even senate control but he has more guys than I do.  He gets battle plains set up with the shiled tarpals and jar jar.  I suck the drain once but then time is called after me deploying maul and ship to Naboo system.  I draw up on my turn to give him the full win since he woulda won in the long run... if the game had a 2 hour time limit.  FL(-18)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Playing Kevin was good game till time<br>
Lows:  Losing first game wtf<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
LS vs Alvin Laus Power Senate Space<br>
<br>
This is a good matchup for me so I was preety confident going into this.  Ive seen Alvin before but dont remeber where.  He starts off by grabbing Executor with Mob points and uses the IAO to drop Mos Espa Dbay with Maul at the hut and moves him over(uhm wtf).  Along with the Tatooine system.  Lott Dod and Aks Moe into the Chamber flipping but he never uses the put 2 cards back part, weird.  I get a god start.  Jedi Council Chamber with Threepio and Qui with Saber to the Generator Core.  Sw33t.  I play battle plan shield to slow his drains.  He doesnt pay to drain in the Senate ever.  Another guy goes into the senate and he picks up some.  I pay to drain and send EPP Luke against Maul YA.  I slice and kill him but no breakthrough.  He activates what is almost his whole deck drops Fonder with Executor there/Chinerau thanks to Were in attack position now and they move to Tatooine system.  I drop Mace to the other Naboo site and play Goo Nee Tay.  He activates tons with Tikkes and doesnt drain but drops EPP Vader to the Mos Espa Dbay with 4-Lom support.  I am tracked at the moment so I drain and EPP Luke makes another appearance against them.  Vader gets hacked and I draw low to kill them both off.  He tries to attack Qui-Gon this turn.  Dengar with Cannon and Xizor.  I Its a Trap away the battle and hope for some beats but I screw it up.  I death finger Dengar with Qui-Gon and chop Xizor down the shoot.  Emperor goes to the Mos Dbay for some reason and he drains for 2 a few times in space.  I drain for some and hit a Edge for 6 and he dies out on my turn.  FW(+26)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning<br>
Lows:  Not too much I guess<br>
<br>
Now here comes the exciting part.  Since we all finish our games preety fast and Jeff Millers stalling out in the corner we decide were gonna go grab a bite before the next round.  So Kevin asks the owner where the nearest food places are and he decides on Jack in the Box.  We dont know exactly where the Box is.  So we hop in the car and drive around.  Every few blocks Kevin sticks his head out the window and asks people walking if they know where the Jack in the Box is.  After a few people we get the shoulder shrug and I dont know.  So we finally find it and theres some guy standing on the sidewalk in front of it.  So I say hey Kev ask that guy if he knows where Jack in the Box is.  So after at least 4 "excuse mes" we get his attention and ask him.  He gives us the shoulder shrug and says I dont  know.  OMFG can you beleive this this guy was almost in the frickin parking lot.  Well anyways we get our food and head back<br>
<br>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs Alvin Laus LS Senate "wheres the point in this deck"<br/>
<br/>
He starts the Jedi Council Chamber which is nice for activation.  I get a preety good draw with senators and some good stuff.  I drop a Dbay from the deck and the Senate Holocam with a few guys in the senate for the flip.  I get the Political Effect that cancels drain.  He plays a Dbay aka coursant dbay battleground and Yoda to the Council Chamber.  I Lotti and Convert his Coursant Dbay.  I drop more guys into the senate and we only have a few battles in there the whole game.  Plo Koon goes to the Jedi Chamber with Valorrum.  I play Tat Dbay while Manipulation his hand with Defensive Fires and my obj.  I drop Onith and Tat Maul to Mauls site and Ability x3 to bleed out his characters or cause him damage.  This didnt work to well.  He drops Obi with Saber and Jar Jar to my Tatooine Dbay.  I Onith his hand not getting anything.  I manip his hand with Obj and a Def Fire.  Qui Joins next turn and they all move over to the Mauls hut.  I drain in the senate and get out the Blockade Flagship a few turns ago with more activation.  I move Onith and Maul to the Dbay.  He comes down with a random senator Pal, and Queeny with Valorrum moving over.  I use payroll of trade federation to kill Palpatines politics and beatdown on his guys with most of my senators.  He loses a couple of guys and next turn moves them back over to the Chamber with no more battles there.  By now I have been plinking him with senate drains everyturn and onith here and there.  I cacnel the mauls hut drain and get the Screw going.  He grabs my Limited Resources.... interesting.  So i do 12 damage with that and drop Vader to his BattlePlains.  I drain there and in the Senate to finish him off.  FW(+20)<br/>

Highs:  Beating a senate deck<br/>
Lows:  None<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Eric Shannons MKOS<br/>
<br/>
This is a rather easy game for me.  He gets the AC out fast and Rendilli with Zuckuss there next turn has to draw because his Sailbarge is in his force pile.  I get Qui and the Jedi Chamber out for fast drains.  The sail barge comes out this turn with the bridge and Jabb + random guys into the AC.  Mace goes to the other Naboo site to max out my drains.  He gets Lower Passageways out and stacks more guys into the AC.  I drain and play battle plan to slow him down because of Galid into the AC.  He flips this turn with Boelo and Myo to the JP and Abyssian to Passageways.  The Abyssian comes back to the AC.  I drop Boussh after draining so slow his drains lots.  Hes draining for 3 to my 4 but I block the other ones up with Luke with saber to kill off Boelo.  He drains for 3 again and drops Ephantmon with someone to the lower passageways.  I drop Obi with saber against them and clear them all out with obi coming back with Jedi Resilence.  I eventually kill of Galid and a few of his guys with a tracked 7 thanks to a houjix.  He deploys a few other guys to back up Myo but hes still draining for 2 to my 4.  Most of the game I drain for 4 the rest of the game and hit a late game edge for retrieval.  FW(+29)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating a deck that I thought would have problems with<br/>
Lows:  None<br/>
<br/>
Well I end up winning the tourny thanks to everybody having timed wins and me only having full wins.  I get 6 packs and a Ben Kenobi foil which I thought was preety good for only 5 bucks.  <br/>
I play against Kevins Dark Deal and lose by 7 like always for some reason.  I gotta figure out someway to beat that deck.  The ride home was preety unevenful cept Clay and Kev talking bout decks and that was about it.  Props and Slops<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Kev for the ride and a game even though it took forever<br/>
Clay for being crazy company<br/>
TD for running a smooth tourney even though kinda screwing Kevin on that timed loss. <br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
Guy at Jack in the box  WTF MAN<br/>
Thats about it<br/>
<br/>
Check soon for the tourny this weekend that will be up soon during the week.  Any questions or comments  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
