Pennsylvania State Championships<br>
Carlisle, PA<br>
<br>
14 months after the debacle that was the 2000 state<br>
championships, I agree to be the host for this year’s<br>
event.  I selected Carlisle, PA since there was a <br>
loyal, but relatively unknown group of players from<br>
that area, plus it is more central than my own area<br>
near Philadelphia.  For those of you that remember<br>
the stories and accusations from last year, keep in <br>
mind that I have many friends that quit the game<br>
after that mess including a fellow squadron member.<br>
I was not going to tolerate any nonsense.  I get my <br>
game face, a bunch of command cards, decklists, and<br>
some prizes I have been accumulating and head to <br>
Central PA....<br>
<br>
I left for Carlisle Saturday morning so that I can<br>
play at James Leiser’s tournament in Harrisburg before<br>
setting up camp in Carlisle.  I had a chance to do some<br>
PR for states and RamapoCon and I went 3-1, including<br>
an early victory against local champ Drew Scott (this<br>
was payback from the 2 games he got from me a few weeks<br>
ago..).  I arrive in Carlisle about 6:30pm, and my room-<br>
mates are not around.  I get some dinner and supplies <br>
and meet up with them a little later.  I am staying <br>
with Mike Carr, who is a great TD that has supported<br>
the game in that area, and his lovely fiance, Shannon<br/>
Caine.  We playtest then hit the sack for the long day <br/>
ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I meet up with Bob Damiani at the Holiday Inn where we<br/>
are holding the event at about 8:15am.  He has elected<br/>
to run the YJ and he is expecting about 8 people.  By<br/>
9 he has 4 so he starts anyway.  SWCCG’ers are starting<br/>
to show up so I begin collecting command cards and <br/>
decklists and away we go.  By 10:30, the posted start<br/>
time, there are 39 people there.  TJ Holman and Chris <br/>
Praskac are conspicuously absent.  One more wanders in <br/>
at 10:45, we get his information, I make some announce-<br/>
ments, and I make pairings and get the first game off at <br/>
11am (which was my goal).  5 minutes later TJ, Chris, and<br/>
Eric Slawko arrive and have to sit and complete cards and<br/>
get 0(0)’s for game 1.  Apparently they got a ticket on <br/>
the way...the story is kinda funny, but I’ll let Chris <br/>
tell it.   So we are underway....<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer:  I will not reveal decktypes played by <br/>
specific players.  I may mention some actions and<br/>
cards, but not the specifics of the decks.  With 43 <br/>
players I did not take the time to figure out light<br/>
side/dark side wins.  I may have that info later.<br/>
<br/>
So the matchups begin.  Games are running smoothly and<br/>
on time for the most part.  Defending Champ Ray Bordier<br/>
wins game 1, then loses a timed game to Pat Ziagos.  TJ <br/>
and Chris win their first game (the second in the <br/>
tournament so they are a little behind for most of the<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
After game 2:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Drew ferguson     4(61)<br/>
2.  Steve Skilton     4(48)<br/>
3.  Joe Young         4(48)<br/>
4.  Drew Scott        4(41)<br/>
5.  Dan Bordier       4(39)<br/>
6.  Nathan Brown      4(39)<br/>
7.  Jim Li            4(36)<br/>
8.  Jared Napolitano  4(35)<br/>
9.  Pat Ziagos        3(52)<br/>
10. Mark Freed        3(26)<br/>
<br/>
TJ Holman has 2(50) and Chris Praskac is 2(23)<br/>
<br/>
Ray wins game 3 by a lot, but then loses to Frank <br/>
Walsh by 8.  With no chance to regain his title, Ray<br/>
drops out at 4(33) and heads home to be with his <br/>
lovely wife and daughter.<br/>
<br/>
After 4 games:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Joe Young         8(86)<br/>
2.  Jim Li            8(74)<br/>
3.  Pat Ziagos        7(88)<br/>
4.  TJ Holman         6(90)<br/>
5.  Chris Praskac     6(58)<br/>
6.  Drew Ferguson     6(52)<br/>
7.  Dan Bordier       6(50)<br/>
8.  Steve Skilton     6(47)<br/>
<br/>
Jim Li’s attendance was a surprise today.  He <br/>
apparently was able to stay in Pittsburgh a while<br/>
longer so he could play in this tournament.  Joe <br/>
Young has not played seriously in about 8 months, so<br/>
his success was a pleasant surprise, as was Dan Bordier.<br/>
Drew and Steve I did not know before today but they <br/>
held their own with the best.  Jim Li beats Joe Young by<br/>
15 and Pat beats TJ by by 25.  Chris Praskac beat Drew F.<br/>
by 24 so Pat and Jim end up playing to see who would go<br/>
undefeated.  The second place was up for grabs between<br/>
Dan, Chris, and Joe Young, depending on who would have<br/>
the highest differential with 5 wins.  Pat ends up <br/>
beating Jim, Joe Young loses to Mark Freed, dropping a<br/>
lot in the standings.  Dan Bordier beats Chris Praskac<br/>
and creeps ahead of Jim Li in differential.  The final <br/>
ratings are listed below.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Pat Ziagos          6-0   11(141)<br/>
2.  Dan Bordier         5-1   10(81) <br/>
3.  Jim Li              5-1   10(61)<br/>
4.  Mark Freed          5-1    9(44)<br/>
5.  TJ Holman           4-1    8(80)<br/>

33. Frank Walsh         2-4    4(-23)<br/>
34. Shannon Caine       2-4    4(-41)<br/>
35. Gary Klinger        1-4    4(-54)*<br/>
36. Josh Whitmore       2-4    4(-56)<br/>

38. Derek Lankford      1-4    4(-76)<br/>
39. Justin Schenk       1-4    3(-94)<br/>
40. Tim Heffner         1-5    2(-88)<br/>
41. Erich Hawbaker      1-5    2(-91)<br/>
42. Billy Walborn       1-5    2(-95)<br/>
43. Lucas Gallagher     0-5    2(-135)*	<br/>
<br/>
So Pat elects to play DS in his first game.  Dan<br/>
Deploys "Dark Lord of My Ass" on the table, which<br/>
has some special properties that you will need to <br/>
read about on Dan’s report.  The game is plugging<br/>
along as they jockey for position..  a drain here,<br/>
a drain there.  Dan decides to deploy a few <br/>
chadra fan to a docking bay...  Pat deploys Iggy <br/>
with gunm Dengar with gun, and a vigo... one<br/>
chadra fan gets captured, the other shot and forfeit<br/>
0.  Dan has to lose 14 force which pretty much <br/>
accelerates the drain race and Pat wins by 32.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that 32 cards is a big hurdle, they begin<br/>
game 2 the same way...slow and methodical.  Dan has<br/>
Mejarrek and Adm. Piett at the Ex DB.  He later deploys<br/>
the Ex to Fondor and moves Piett to the bridge.  Pat<br/>
deploys Corran EPP Luke, and the Lars’ card. He <br/>
initiates and plays Harvest for 2 added destiny.  <br/>
Pat smacks Mejarrek 27-2, which again depletes Dan’s<br/>
life force.  Dan still owns 2 systems and the Lars Farm<br/>
with Vader and Tarkin.  Pat pulls a fast one on Dan by<br/>
playing Lost in the Wilderness and VAder is missing.  <br/>
Dan then forms a party with Tarkin and finds him that<br/>
turn!  Pat goes down and smacks them around a bit with<br/>
C3PO, Artoo, EPP Han, and Ben Kenobi with LS and Prof. <br/>
They just continue the drains to the end.  Pat by 17.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it!!  Pat Ziagos plays 8 games and <br/>
wins them all to take home a nifty fanny pack, some <br/>
DS2 packs, and his very own Joey Gagliardi action<br/>
figure.  Dan is pleased with his effort, but is annoyed<br/>
with all of his friends calling him on his cell phone<br/>
during the showdown.  I had to answer all his calls!!<br/>
<br/>
Cool Stuff:<br/>
<br/>
-43 people showing up!!<br/>
-TJ, Chris, and Eric showing up late but acting like<br/>
gentleman (for the most part)<br/>
-Mike Carr and Shannon for letting me stay with them<br/>
and watch Malcolm in the Middle and X files in the<br/>
hotel room afterwards.<br/>
-The Holiday Inn for letting us play there.<br/>
-No one complaining too loudly when I gave out JK<br/>
boosters and starters as prizes<br/>
-Marco and Wojciech bringing me back lunch while I<br/>
was running the show<br/>
-Me for being so organized with the command cards..  <br/>
it really is a gift!!! (blackouts do happen, guys..)<br/>
<br/>
Could have been better:<br/>
<br/>
-TJ, Chris, and Eric showing up late.  They could have<br/>
played more relaxed if they weren’t coming from behind<br/>
the whole day.  (the officer’s bad-a$$ attittude too)<br/>
-Bob Evans for being understaffed when I wanted break-<br/>
fast<br/>
-Having to go to work the next day  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading!  <br/>
