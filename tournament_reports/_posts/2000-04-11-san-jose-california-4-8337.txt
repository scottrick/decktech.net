<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Its Friday night and Clayton Atkins asks if I was going to San Jose to help playtest some of his decks for States.....I had to refuse since I didnt know anyone wanted to go out there, there being a local tourney in San Francisco.<br>
I wake up the next morning late, and my carpets being cleaned so I cant catch a ride out there, so I talk to Grand Slam winner Ohmy Fasudhani online, and he gives me a ride down to Ballpark Game Center in San Francisco. Turns out Ohmy wanted to go to San Jose.....nice. We head to Ballpark but the tournament failed to sanction(SAT testing) with 4 people. We chilled there(I got in some YJ trades and SW games) until around 4(tournament at 6) when Ohmy calls up another local player, Chris Leung, and we all head down to San Jose. <br>
<br>
We get there in time.....Ohmy and Chris try to work out some things in thier decks. No sign of Clayton.....hmm.....guess he hit traffic. He finally comes in, a little late, but on time enough that we hadnt started yet. He brings along Kevin Shannon....and Matt Smith arrives to make this tournament interesting.<br>
Im playing Speed Profit and Hunt Down Choke Out, to playtest and work things out for States next week.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS Hunt Down Choke Out vs. Jabroni Kid's LS QMC<br>
<br>
I think his name was Chris, I dont remember. He starts Bespin and Guest Quarters, I start Crush with Hunt Down goods w/ Epic Duel. Vader comes down first turn to the Guest Quarters for a first turn flip. He loses to Visage for the rest of the game. His turn he grabs Bespin: Cloud City and deploys it with an ECC Z-95 there. My turn I drain, drop Fett in Slave 1 to deal with it....i battle, he loses the ship plus a few more. His turn he drops 2 Z-95s to Bespin. My turn I drop Bossk in Hounds Tooth and battle. I draw a 1 so i lose a few but he loses a ship. He doesnt back the Z-95 on his turn, so Bossk finishes it plus a few more. I set up Battle Order, and by now, Im draining for 5 a turn in addition to Visage damage. He finally goes and grabs another site, the Core Tunnel, and deploys CC Leia there with Anakins Lightsaber.....I guess he doesnt know she cant drain. He figures that out next turn and deploys Chewie and moves Leia to where Vader is. I drop Tarkin and Zuckuss to the Guest Quarters and battle. I Weapon Lev Leias sword, and miss the choke on her. Zuckuss makes Chewie forfiet =0, so its all good. I pull a 5 for destiny and he loses both to attrition as I cancel his destiny. he draws out seeing as how he cant flip while Vader and Co. are chilling at his Guest Quarters. Win by 37.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+37)<br>
Highs: Nothing much...winning I guess<br>
Lows: Playing a kid<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS Speed Profit vs. Clayton Atkins DS Raltiir Ops<br>
<br>
Hahahaha......turns out Clayton and I have similar differentials and we meet each other again since awhile ago. Me and him have this rivalry going on, Ive never beaten him in a tournament game, he's never beaten me in a fun game. Well, I had a feeling all that changes today. He starts Raltiir with IAO and no aliens to the AC. I start Profit standards with General Solo and Insurrection. My opening hand is horrible(no one but Tawss Khaa and EPP Han) so I draw and find Luke and free Han second turn. He sets up Raltiir and drops AT-ST pilots to Raltiir to flip. I poke him with the Objective and he loses.....Imperial Decree. Nice. Now he regroups all his guys to the Forest(in the middle btwn the Swamp and Jungle), and sits with Tempest Scout 1 and draws for awhile. I find almost nothing that helps as I draw, so I move Luke to Jabbas Palace to poke him for 2 a turn and leave Han with Ben. He has a million activated since he saves a few every turn. I have a million activated for the same reason. It's now a drain race....him doing 4 to me from drains to me doing 3 to him from Objective and lightsaber. He finally makes a move and drops Mara w/ saber to the Swamp. I count my force......half my deck is activated. I look at my hand...I decide Im going for it. I drop ECC Lando, Tawss, Orrimaarko and Artoo(yes, Artoo) to the Swamp to meet Mara. No Barriers were played, so I battle. He reacts over Tempest Scout 1 w/ Evax over. Great....Not so beatdown. I steal her saber via Weapon Lev, Lando gets Mara shot, I draw a 5 for destiny. He draws a 4, for a total of six for battle destiny, which wouldve meant 2 guys, but Artoo saves the day(Dont Forget the Droids!!!). He loses 4 plus Orrimaarko damage....afterwards Orrimaarko and Tawss get killed as he Tramples Lando. We go back to the 'drain race' if you can call it that, and he eventually decides to kill the lone Master Luke sitting at Jabba's Palace. He drops 3 Imperials with a tracked destiny and I play On the Edge to kill Luke and stop beatdown. Next turn, the Master returns with his saber, and Yoda's Gimer Stick and Order to Engage. Clay's in trouble now......sit where Luke is and lose 3 a turn or go battle Ben and Han? He goes for Ben and Han, and they crush them....a few turns later hes out of options, and I drain him out. Win by 16.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+43)<br>
Highs: Great game...havent played one like that in awhile.....and I finally beat Clay! Now if only he can beat me in a fun game.<br>
Lows: Nothing much<br>
<br>
<br>
We take a small break for dinner and me and Clay go over the klunks of the game and the mistakes we made. We go over to Taco Bell and come back full of Chalupas and Tacos, and me and Clay play a game utilizing his Skrillings vs. my Ewoks.....I edged him out by 2 cards in the end, and I keep my undefeated record.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: DS Hunt Down Choke Out vs, Steve Daniel's LS Tosche Mains<br/>
<br/>
So its me and Steve in the lead, and were off. I start Crush again, he starts Obi's Hut and Tosche Station. I get a solid hand, but the only characters in my hand are EPP Vader and Evax. I drop Cantina and draw a few and pick up 4-LOM w/ gun and Jabba. His turn he picks up.....my turn, I drop Vader to Tosche to flip and move to Obi's Hut. His turn he drops EPP Luke there to stop my drain of 3 there on my turn, but he cant battle thanks to Hunt Down. My turn I activate, drop Jabba and 4-LOM to Vader and battle. 4-LOM blanks Lukes text, Vader hacks Luke, and I draw 2 destinies, and luck out with a 7 and a 6..(I forgot I Have You Know, I know, but thats why I came here)...ow. He draws a 3, so 4-LOM dies and he owes Luke and 16 more. He loses alot off the top to it, and on his turn he drops Harc Seff and Tawss to Tosche for more force.....I wont have it, so I drop Evax and Blizzard 2 there and battle. We both draw 1's, I'm immune, he loses both. I move Evax to the Hut and I move Vader and Jabba to the Station. Now he starts drawing like mad for Ben or something, as he hits one a turn to Visage and eats my drains. He eventually ends up dropping Ben to the station and battling at Vader. Ben gets hacked, I play I Have You Now and I draw low as does he. He loses Ben and a few and I lose Jabba. He draws up a few turns later. Win by 39.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 6(+82)<br/>
Highs: Vader dominated<br/>
Lows: Smacking for that much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS Speed Profit vs. Alex Stefanko's DS Imperial Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Alright, we end it with Profit. He starts Secret Plans and no aliens due to fear from beatdown, and I start Insurrection.  He drops DLOTS there first turn w/ saber first turn anyways. My turn I Signal for I Must Be Allowed To Speak. I play that and Master for free. I battle, play The Force Is Strong With This One. He chokes at Luke but gets on shy with a 5. He chops and draws double 1's(had he done it the other way around...). I pull three destinies of 4, and he pulls a 1. Vader dies out and Luke lives. His turn he plays Premiere Vader to Jabba's Palace with the saber since he's scared of Master Luke's immunity. My turn I free Han, drain 1 lose 1. This happens for awhile, and we both drop characters to the 2 Tatooine locations and set up drains. I eventually get Artoo, and drop him for A Gift(which works because somewhere along the way he dropped Dannik Jerriko to Vader). His turn Artoo moves over to stop his drains. He drops Zuckuss in MH to Endor to give me more problems. I decide to leave that alone, so I draw for a site and get the Carbonite Chamber....I set up ECC Lando and Tawss there.....now Im doing 3 from drains and 2 from Objective damage to his 2 drain at Endor. Visage is also poking at both of us since I cant find my Transmissions. He cant Elis because of Insurrection and draws like mad for Hutt Smooch to get rid of Artoo(doesnt matter...I had Boushh in my hand), which he lost first turn to Visage. He finds Hutt Smooch in his Lost Pile and he gives up after that. Win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 8(+104)<br/>
Highs: Finally playing the local dominator<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I end up at the top of the pack and take home a Cloud City poster and some packs, of which I get a Chewbacca of Kashyyyk. Matt Smith places 2nd and pulls a WB Vader from prize support. Ohmy and Chris go 3-1 respectively, and Clayton surprises me by goin 1-3. All in all a fun time was had by all. I play Clayton with my Hunt Down afterwards to try out his Y4 mains. I purposely intiate a blind duel and lose Vader out of play for fun.....but I still end up winning as I drew all his guys to Y4 where his drains are 0 and mine are minimum 2....IG-88 captures Obi....thats game. Now I know what I need to do for State Championships....<br/>
