Rate it <a href='"http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/decks/decks.php?deck=27718"'>here</a><br>
<br>
LS - Watch Your Mom/She Likes It A Little Rough<br>
Standard WYS using only a few surprises: Bacta Tank, We're Doomed for use with Naked Threepio and Artoo BLD, and using On The Edge for retrieval.  I knew everyone would be prepared for this, but I trusted my experience and comfort with the deck to put me over the top.<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
SYCF(A)UCK vs Joe Laporta's RTP<br>
Well, I get a God Hand.  It includes Executor, Piett, and an Imp Command, so I'm happy.  I grab Rendili, use Command for Chiraneau, drop the DSWR, Corsucant DB, and save my force.  He gets his jank going, throwing down R2D2 and moving him along.  I drop out Executor and Piett at Rendili and draw for another ship.  Next turn I throw down Merrejk and grab Kiffex, drop a ship and pilot at Rendili, Chiraneau on Exec and mvoe it to Kiffex. Draw and get my Fear.  R2 is chillin at DSWR by the end of his turn, so I pop out CHYBC and next turn he wont get to drain or retrieve.  I pop another system, a ship, and Fear, leaving force now for Barrier.  He frees Leia, uses Lift Tube and Swoop tech to get her flipped same turn.  He starts attacking me with Dash and Pulsar Skate.  I have the AO out and Dash draws a 3 against one of my ships and I draw a 4, so Dash dies and I don't.  Pulsar Skate gets the Lat Damage and smackdown.  He loses a few force.  He sticks out HCF and I barrier, he puts another pilot on pulsar and moves it over, cancelling Laty Damage.  I First Strike, Lat Damage Skate again, and play Imp Command, to remove him from the game effectively.  He loses everything, I lose nothing.  He then showed me his Punch it and says he wanted to play it, and that he hates Imp Command.<br>
FW 23, (2, +23)<br>
Highs: Lat Damage x2, lucky destiny 4<br>
Lows: forgetting to retrieve Dominator to make me +24<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
WYS vs Dan Blackford's Saber Combat<br>
Or should I say Brian Hunter's.  It is almsot exactly card for card Brian Hunter's Saber comabt, and most of the cards are mine.  We playtested this four times, and I lost three times, so I was hoping for a small loss.  He had Maul w/ Stick all game at the site where my scrubs get sent to Used when hit.  I set up drain at Kessel with Cap'n Han, Falcon, Dash, and Outrider.  I got Phylo with some support at the Executor DB, and he tried all game to no avail to kill her off.  Luke stays at Tat DB to satisfy my Menace Fades, but gets chases a lot by Vader and cronies.  He dropped Executor, Piett, Guri and Stinger at Kessel with a Lat Damage on Outrider, and I have to lose Dash and Han, sending Han to Bacta Tank.  I On The Edge a total of 3 times with tracked AFMs, and Dash gets back on Outrider when Han gets back on Falcon.  I spread out with Falcon and Outrider too late, and he outdrains me, even though I use We're Doomed a few times, because I didn't take the opportunity I had to set up Menace Fades by moving Luke to an unoccupied site.<br>
FL -11, (2, +12)<br>
Highs: 3 OTE, We're Doomed<br/>
Lows: Playing a bad late game strategy, Guri is a b-witch.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
SYCFA vs Michael Faughn's Profit<br/>
Not much to say here, Profit vs SYCFA is always close, but SYCFA has yet to lose to a Profit deck, and this time I'm playing Imp Decree and an extra Undercover spy, so I'm pretty sure I have the advantage.  Mike plays well though and gives me a run for my money.  I set up extremely fast, and he flips turn 3 with Arica blocking his drain.  U-3PO blocks another drain and Corran Horn comes down to break U-3PO, so I assume he's out of spies and drop someone to Coruscant DB keeping a barrier in hand just in case.  By turn 5, I now have a UC Arica blocking his biggest drain, Decree in effect, he pays to drain and I don't (Emperor at DSDB), drain for 9 and 8 direct damage.  After a couple turns of this, the game is over.  Last turn of the game, I drop First Strike and take out Luke with Vader to retrieve 1.<br/>
FW +13, (4, +25)<br/>
Highs: Lightning Fast setup, getting to start Arica on table<br/>
Lows: I was itching to beat something up all game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
WYS vs David Irvine's Watto<br/>
Well I have about a 0-9 million record against David Irvine, who is somewhere around #30 in the world.  He's playing Chu's Watto, and he plays it well.  I pull Dont DO That Again to prevent him from sacking his YCHF/MP combo for a S&amp;D, but he pulls out Baron and sticks it on Tat.  I get such a crappy hand, my first turn I really have nothing better to do than pop out Aim High and send Watto to Used for 8 force and he retrieves none since he left none.  This cancels S&amp;D, which rules.  He drops a Watto from hand, and s me for a few force.  I figure he hasn't drawn much so he can't have much to protect Baron, so I drop Dash and Outrider, which gets barriered.  I then make the stupid assumption that he has an SFS cannon, so I won't waste my Melas on it so that he can kill both of them with one shot.  Bad mistake.  Zuckuss comes down and owns me, and this turn I end up losing a Luke off the top to Watto.  I cry a lot because he shut me down completely.<br/>
FL -27 (4, -2)<br/>
Highs: This is my last loss of the 8 game tourney.  Getting to see David, who I haven't seen in ages.<br/>
Lows: Getting shutdown.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
WYS vs Chris Shaw's LSC<br/>
I thought I'd be playing a scrub now after going 2-2, but Chris Shaw is a pretty good player.  He is Keith'spadawan and gets to playtest with him a lot.  I couldn't find Kessel all game, but setup Menace Fades and kept a few solid drains to put the pressure on him.  We had a few battles there and there.  I nailed Emperor with Lando and Gun using Blaster Prof to add 3 to destiny, and since he was with a smuggler, I drew 2 destiny to his one, and he lost Emp and some force.  Phylo Gandish puts the hurts on him at his Coruscant DB.  On the last few turns, I We're Doomed when I was down to 14, and played OTE twice on the same tracked AFM.<br/>
FW +22 (6, +20)<br/>
Highs: Finally beating LSC by a wide margin.<br/>
Lows: Not getting a chance to play OTE a 3rd time.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
SYCFA vs Jim Brogan's M&amp;T<br/>
I got Keder in my opening hand, and dropped it to one of his DBs to block a drain.  Got Kiffex and Executor on second turn and drew Arica, so I blocked his second drain.  Spread out all over space, and by turn 5 he was losing 17 per turn.  He got a few drains in here and there, running away from my spies.  He always had 2 BGs, so I could never use CHYBC to block his DSWR drain, so I got Arica over there via DB transit.  Toward the end of the game, I moved Arica to the DB, and attacked EPP Luke with Darth Vader(V).  he lost Luke, and Vader stuck around.  Other than that one battle, completely non-interactive game.  I drain him out.<br/>
FW +28 (8, +48)<br/>
Highs: Spies, Vader kicking Luke'sand being immune to attrtion.  Talking about Boston with Jim after the game, which is where he's from and where I'm going this weekend.<br/>
Lows: Not satisfying my craving for blood.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7:<br/>
SYCFA vs Dan Blackford's RST<br/>
Well we playtested this a few times, but Dan built it the night ebfore, and he missed two things.  1) On 0 side, he can only drain for 1.  2) He was only using 1 Explosive Charge (ouch!).  So, we knew how this would end.  I setup and drained, sticking Keder at the Back Door with DOS.  Early on he decided he needed to damage me, so he moved Madine and a scout into the Bunker and Cracken and a scout into DSWR.  I pulled CHYBC and he drained me for 0.  Sweet.  I spread out in space.  He knows that my deck will him if he decides to try to attack me with Falcon or anything, so he sticks Gold Squad 1, Nien Numb and Gen Lando at Endor.  I Lat Damage the ship, drop down Zuckuss, Evax, and Dengar and battle, he reacts with Spiral, and I forget to barrier.  But it's OK, cause I draw Emperor for destiny and add 2 to it, so he has to lose Spiral and Nien Numb, while his lowdestiny makes me lose only Dengar.  He misses blowing up the shield a bunch of times, cause he's a scrub who forgot to use 2 Explosive Charges.  When he plays Throw Me Another Charge, I catch it so he cant track it.  He's spreading out to try to damage me, and I pop out Battle Order since I can afford it, and he can't.  I don't even use lube on this one.<br/>
FW +18 (10, +66)<br/>
Highs: Getting revenge on Dan (with +7 diff in my favor)<br/>
Lows: Not barriering Spiral to make the win massive.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8:<br/>
WYS vs Keith Molyneaux's Black Sun<br/>
Keith has a 2-0 record against me at this point, and he's #1 right now in the tourney, so I'm scared.  We talk and play casually, because I predict a loss in 6-7 turns.  First turn he moves Xizor to Coruscant DB battleground.  I have a god hand, so I drop Phylo, Lando w/ Gun, and Mirax at the DB.  He Set For Stuns Lando, and I grab it.  Well that sucks.  I battle anyway, and he draws &lt;4, so they both stay.  Nice.  His turn, he just drops BFHI and draws a lot until he gets Xizor apparently, who goes to Cantina with the Emp.  I deploy Lando with Gun and Melas and battle, hit Xizor, and then draw 2 destiny, and he asks me if I paid 2 for BFHI.  I realize I didn't, and we take the whole battle back.  Instead I put Dash, Outrider and Melas in space, and flip.  The rest of the game is a blur, because it was hugely intense.  I wating him for 3 at the Coruscant DB and 3 in space, so he was taking a lot of damage and it put the pressure on him.  I was still laid back because I thought I was going to lose anyway, even though I obviously had the upper hand.  Luke comes and dies a bunch of times.  Phylo eventually dies to Zuckuss in Mist Hunter + ECC 4LOM at the DB (weird, huh?).  I think I end up being able to kill the Emperor for a few overflow, but only after he cancels the battle several times with Stunning Leader.  The TD calls 15 minutes, and we're both surprised cause it seems like we just started.  He tracks a 7 to send Luke to my hand at one point, which is nice.  I spread around in space, and end up killing off Bossk and Zuckuss, which means he has to start paying for drains.  We are about to time out, and he draws up.  I am kinda pissed, because I wasn't so sure I was going to win, and I didn't  want a full win out of sympathy.  He said I deserved the win, because I played well, which I thought was an incredible compliment.  Anyway, he did draw up, even if I didn't like it, so...<br/>
FW +11 (12, +77)<br/>
Highs: Playing one of the most fun and msot challenging games of SWCCG I've eve rplayed.  Making few mistakes and playing well.<br/>
Lows: Running out of  time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Final Confrontations:<br/>
1. Keith Molyneaux<br/>
2. David Irvine<br/>
3. Lee Edwards (me!)<br/>
4. Daniel Blackford<br/>
<br/>
There's not much to talk about in the final, and it isn't sanctioned.  I was tired and anxious to get home to my girlfriend to get some prize support, so here is a quick summary.<br/>
Keith picks my LS vs his DS (surprise, surprise), so we play.<br/>
I get a shyte hand and know that I've lost as soon as I see it.  He BFHIs me, and screws with me all game.  I can't find Kessel.  He barriers, Set for Stuns, and kills Luke every time I hit table, and his deck works like a machine.  I think I drain him at Kessel once or twice toward the end of the game, but he treats me like a Catholic alterboy.  Game is over in less than 20 minutes and I lose by something in  the twenties, but 2 force less than Dan's loss to David, so I stay in third and standings stay the same.  I get a bunch of DS2 packs and declare that I will be pulling a LSJK in the first pack I open.  It's actually an Emperor, but I'm not surprised, because I have psychic powers.  Next pack is Imperial Command, and the rest is shyte.  I go back to Dan's house and my girlfriend and I have sex in Dan Blackford's 11 year old brother's bed. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
