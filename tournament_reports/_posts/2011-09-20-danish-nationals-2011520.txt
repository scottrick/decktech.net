<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <b><u>SWCCG Danish National Championship 2011</u></b><br>
<br>
Ok, as those of you who have read any of my tournament reports in the past will know, I usually start off these things with a lengthy description of my/our travels towards the tournament location. However, this time, the tournament was practically held in my own backyard, so there really aint much to tell. I took a bus for 20 minutes, walked for 5 minutes, and then I was there Exciting!!<br>
<br>
Before getting too far ahead, I should take a minute to talk about my deck choices for this tournament. Up until the night before, I had serious doubts about which decks to bring. I had recently made a Watto-deck that I was doing ok with, but there was one issue. I had never, until like a week earlier, played Watto before. I had a few playtesting sessions with my friend, Casper aermet69 Jørgensen, and during those games Id done pretty well with my creation. So the choice was between Watto, the Hunt Down (non-v) that Id played at the European Championship (and finished 4th), or the SYCFA deck that we (Team Copenhagen) had played at the Berlin Year-Starter tournament in January. I decided that with all the recent playtest experience Id gotten with Watto, that was going to be the one I chose. The deck uses Combat Response (v) and a few matching ship/pilot pairs (Zuckuss + Mist Hunter (v), Darth Maul + ship, Baron Fel + Saber 1 + Cannons) to hold Tatooine, then runs Tatooine Occupation to amplify the direct damage coming from the objective itself. The character selection is a mix of EPPs (2x Vader, 1x Mara Jade, 1x Maul), Emperor (v), Sidious, Veers (v) and useful support characters. It uses Imperial Barrier and Cease Fire to battle on my terms, as well as Dr. Evazan and Disarmed to take out opponents characters during the control phase. Against a strong space deck, I would have to be wary of going to systems, but against most ground or balanced decks, I think it was well fleshed out.<br>
<br>
For Light side, I was also torn. Id recently made a Lightsaber Combat with Podracing deck, that did ok at local play nights, but I wasnt sure how well it would do at an actual higher-level tournament. I didnt feel I had enough experience playing against a variety of different decks, so I scrapped that idea. Then there was my TRM deck, but I seem to have trouble getting consistent good results with it, so scrapped that one also. What I ended up settling with was the Rebel Senate deck that myself, Kristian Lund and Jesper Hansen played in Berlin. The deck is about setting up with Mon Mothma and Bail, Father of Rebellion at the Senate, setting up a strong character or two at the Nightclub, and drain for 3-5 with sabers and the So This Is How Liberty Dies political effect. The deck also has a space package like that of most TRM decks (Home One, Gold Leader in Gold 1, HCF), and is quite able to battle at my opponents sites. It only runs one of each character (Mace, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Luke Rebel Scout), but its strongly focused on keeping them alive through interrupts like Blaster Deflection, Swing-And-A-Miss and A Jedis Resilience, while wearing down my opponents forces with Lightsaber hits followed by Sorry About The Mess combo. Seeking An Audience (v) and Jedi Levitation (v) make sure that even if my characters do leave table, they can come back again any time I want them to. Kristian Lund originally designed the deck before the Berlin Year-Starter tourney, and Ive only modified about 4-5 cards to suit my own desires. Gotta give credit where credit is due :)<br>
<br>
With the decks locked in, I was ready to leave for the tournament.<br>
<br>
Ok, so skipping forward to arrival at the venue. I arrived on location about 10 minutes before the tournament was scheduled to start, and had yet to fill out my decklists. Frantically trying to juggle greeting those of my Danish friends whod traveled here from other parts of the country (Rasmus Juul, Kent Larsen and Stephan Garmark), saying hi to those I knew who had arrived from other countries (Angelo Consoli - Germany/Italy, and Krisfoffer Hedlund and Antti Oksaren - Sweden), and getting my decklists written up and handed in to the TD, I managed to be done by about 11:05 (start time set to 11:00). Lucky for me, it seemed that at least one other player was also running late in handing in the decklists, so at least I wasnt single-handedly holding up the entire tourney. Meanwhile, a couple of the guys who were already ready went to the supermarket around the corner and picked up a few cases of beer. Cant have a Star Wars tourney in Viking country without some beer to go along with it!<br>
<br>
Finally everyone had finished preparations, and our TD, Kristian Lund, got started on the pre-tourney announcements, and then the first pairings were called. Lets get down to business, shall we? <br>
<br>
<b><u>Game 1: Rebel Senate vs. Antti Oksarens Hunt Down w/ Epic Duel</u></b><br>
<br>
Ok, so my first game is going to be against Antti, from Sweden. I first met Antti in January, at the Season Starter tourney in Berlin, but didnt get a chance to play him then. At that particular tournament, he did place in the bottom of the list, but anyone can have a bad day and place lower than usual, so I wasnt going to let that fact lull me into a false state of overconfidence. <br>
<br>
I put down my objective, Plead My Case To The Senate, Coruscant: Galactic Senate and Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber, then play Heading For The Medical Frigate to deploy Wokling (v), Strike Planning and Quick Draw (v) onto the table. <br>
<br>
Antti reveals Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi, deploys Executor: Holotheatre with Visage of the Emperor there, then also deploys Executor: Meditation Chamber and Epic Duel, after which he plays Prepared Defenses to deploy Gift of the Master, Tarkins Bounty (v) and Imperial Arrest Order (might have been the combo, I dont recall.) Im intrigued by the Epic Duel, as you dont really see dueling anymore, at least not locally in Copenhagen, so I actually have to re-read the card an extra time, just so I dont slip up because Id forgotten how it worked. Luckily I have 2 A Jedis Resilience in the deck, so Im not too worried about getting my guys dueled out of play. <br/>
<br/>
At the start of Anttis turn, I play Might of the Republic to take Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion into hand, before he gets his grabber-shield out, and when he still doesnt put out his grabber, I also play a Let The Wookie Win, electing to take a Blaster Deflection into hand. Antti finishes activating, then goes for Death Star II: Docking Bay with his IAO, fetches Blaster Rack (v) with GotM, and proceeds to draw the rest of his Force Pile into hand. We both lose to Visage of the Emperor. <br/>
<br/>
On my turn, before activating, I grab Senator Mon Mothma with Strike Planning. I decide to play it aggressively and drop both Mon Mothma and Bail, Father of Rebellion to the Senate for the first turn flip. I then go for a political effect with the flip side of my objective, pulling and deploying So This Is How Liberty Dies. After pulling Saitorr Kal Fas (v) with Quick Draw (v), I draw the remainder of my Force Pile, and end my turn, both of us again losing Force to Visage. <br/>
<br/>
Antti uses IAO to get out Endor: Landing Platform, and deploys Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith there, along with his Lightsaber, flipping his objective. At the end of his turn,  I lose another Force to Visage of the Emperor. <br/>
<br/>
I play another Might of the Republic, this time taking Mas Amedda into hand, then activate 3 Force, use those Force to activate Wokling (v)s once-per-game text and take Senate Hovercam into hand, then finish activating. I deploy Coruscant system from hand (the Coruscant expansion one), deploy the Hovercam, and use Mon Mothmas once-per-game text to deploy a battleground. Unfortunately, the only remaining battleground in my deck (Coruscant: Nightclub) has made its way into my Force Pile, so Antti gets to verify my deck, and Ill have to dig manually for my primary drain location. I draw some cards (no Nightclub among them unfortunately), play the Battle Plan shield, then end my turn and lose to Visage. <br/>
<br/>
Antti pays 3 Force to drain me for 3 at the Endor: Landing Platform, then deploys Mara Jade With Lightsaber there to back up Vader, and ends his turn. I lose to Visage again (ok, you get the point by now.. I lose to Visage at the end of every turn.. Shocking, I know!). <br/>
<br/>
I drop Mace Windu (v) plus his Lightsaber to the Landing Platform (flipping his objective back to the 0-side) and initiate battle. I take my first swing at Vader, hitting him and then losing 1 Force to play Sorry About The Mess &amp; Blaster Proficiency lost, to make Vader go to the Lost Pile immediately . Mara Jade then swings at Mace, but I still got the Blaster Proficiency I pulled at the beginning of the game, so she gets denied. Mace takes his second swing. I dont recall whether I hit Mara Jade or not, but after battle destines were drawn and the battle ended, Mace remained standing, and nothing was left on Anttis side of the location. <br/>
<br/>
Antti quickly retaliates, dropping Darth Maul With Lightsaber to the Landing Platform, and battles Mace. I have a Swing-And-A-Miss in hand, but since Maul can swing twice, I let him take the first swing without using it, figuring that if he hits, I might as well save the card for later, and if he misses, I can use it to most likely prevent his second swing from hitting. My gamble pays off, because Mauls first swing misses Mace. I then take my first swing at Maul, and hit him. As Antti goes in to take his second attempt at hitting Mace, I play my Swing-And-A-Miss and draw a 2. A little lower than Id have liked, but it still means that Antti will have to draw a total of 10 or more to hit Mace. As it turns out, he draws a 6 and a 1, so he wouldnt have hit, even had I not used the interrupt. Oh well. So as the battle ends, Maul hits the Lost Pile, Mace stays alive, and no one takes any battle damage. <br/>
<br/>
I decline to drain, instead dropping Home One to Coruscant for free drains in the future, as Antti doesnt seem to have much space, if any at all. I also set up Mas Amedda in the Senate, so that unless he can clear me off either the Landing Platform or the system, Ill be dealing 2 additional damage to him during each of my control phases. On Anttis turn, he draws, evidently in an attempt to get some new characters into hand to take my Mace off of his Landing Platform. <br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I drain for free, hit him for 2 with Mas Amedda, then draw a bunch of cards to give myself some protection from whatever Antti is going to come down with next. He drops another Darth Maul With Lightsaber and attacks. I managed to draw into a Blaster Deflection, and I play that to ward off his first swing, and his second swing misses. I hit Maul in return, and again the site is cleared of all but Mace, and no battle damage is taken by either player. <br/>
<br/>
My next turn I drop Senator Leia Organa on the Home One (to activate the game text of my political effect, making my drains where I have a Rebel +1 and uncancelable.)  Anttis next move is to deploy Lord Vader to the Landing Platform, get his saber from Lost Pile, and then play Unexpected Interruption to take Vaders Anger (v) into hand. He then declines battling and proceeds into his move phase, where he plays Vaders Anger (v) to initiate an epic duel with Mace. We draw destiny and Mace ends up on the losing side. Luckily, Ive anticipated this move ever since I saw his Epic Duel at the start, and so I have been saving an A Jedis Resilience in hand. I play the AJR to cancel the duel, returning his interrupt to his hand. Lord Vader stays in front of Mace, and on my next turn, after draining in space, I battle him off the Landing Platform. After this, Antti doesnt have a lot of tricks left in his sleeves get it?.. Sleeves? Deck Protectors? Ooookay, moving on..<br/>
<br/>
As I said, he doesnt have a lot of options left. He comes down one more time against Mace, but he survives again, and stays there draining until its game over. Full win.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 1-0, Victory Points: 2.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 2: Watto vs. Rasmus Juuls Senate</u></b><br/>
<br/>
In my second game, I get to take on Rasmus. Rasmus used to be a local from Copenhagen years ago, but has since moved to Horsens, which is like halfway across the, admittedly small, country (about 2,5 hours by train.) Hes made a few guest appearances at our local Monday night tourneys when hes had a chance to come over, and he usually brings his Senate deck (the original, not Rebel Senate). So when he puts down Plead My Case To The Senate, Im not overly surprised, but I am wary, as I dont have a lot of experience playing against it, and I know Rasmus handles the deck well. I also didnt pack any Senate counters in my deck so Ill just have to win on my own merit, without any bullets to take out his political effects. I do have the shield that makes stacked Amidalas count as senators though. <br/>
<br/>
Rasmus starts the Galactic Senate and Jedi Council Chamber, and plays HFTMF to deploy Wokling (v), Strike Planning and Menace Fades. <br/>
<br/>
I deploy No Money, No Parts, No Deal!, Tatooine: Wattos Junkyard and Tatooine: Mos Espa. I play Prepared Defenses to deploy Kuat Drive Yards (v), Endor Shield and Combat Response (v).<br/>
<br/>
First turn, I pull both Admiral Ozzel and General Veers (v) with Endor Shield before activating, while Rasmus pulls Senator Mon Mothma with his Strike Planning, and puts out Chasm (v), The Professor (v) and A Tragedy Has Occurred. I have a Watto (v) in my hand, but I still go for the once-per-game deploy from Reserve Deck with my Wattos Junkyard game text, dropping Watto for 1 Force due to the Professor shield. I drop Ozzel for 1 Force to Mos Espa, flip my objective, and place a card face down with its game text. Rasmus loses Mon Mothma from hand, as well as some other card. I figure he might be trying to use Wokling (v) to retrieve her before my turn ends, so he can pull her again with Strike Planning, and therefore I put out the Come Here You Big Coward shield, to prevent his retrieval. I then use Kuat Drive Yards (v) to pull Tatooine (Coruscant version), move Ozzel over to join Watto at the Junkyard (flipping my objective back), and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Rasmus drops another Senator Mon Mothma from hand (oh well, so much for my retrieval theory) as well as Senator Palpatine, for the flip. He then pulls a political effect from his Reserve Deck, draws a few cards, and says go.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I reveal Mauls Sith Infiltrator, using Combat Response (v) to take Darth Maul into hand and deploy both simultaneously for 6 Force to the Tatooine system. Rasmus pulls a political effect into hand with his objective. I draw one card, and pass the action over to Rasmus again.<br/>
<br/>
Rasmus activates, then uses his once-per-game text on Mon Mothma to go for a battleground location. However, just like happened to me in game 1, his Nightclub has hidden away in his Force Pile. Afterwards, Rasmus realized he should of course have pulled a political effect first with his objective, to check if the site was in there, and curses himself for the bad play. Turns out to be my luck, as this seriously narrows his options for causing me any damage. He now has to come to me, and try to take over my locations. Rasmus draws a few, and saves 2 Force.<br/>
<br/>
I drop Darth Sidious to Mos Espa for another flip, and place Janus Greejatus face-down with its game text. Rasmus opts to pay the 2 Force, and I get to deploy Janus for two, to Wattos Junkyard. I then drop Tatooine Occupation, draw a few cards, and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
On Rasmus next turn, he drops Luke With Lightsaber to Mos Espa, but he gets Imperial Barriered. He then follows up with Obi-Wan With Lightsaber and plays Civil Disorder (v). Because of my Coward-shield however, he cannot use its character-retrieving game text just yet, as he only occupies that one battleground. Obi-Wan battles Sidious and hits him with his Lightsaber. I draw a battle destiny of 3, but Rasmus places a Senator on one of his political effects, subtracting 3 from my total. He in turn draws a 6, and places another senator on a different political effect, to add 3 to his. I end up losing Darth Sidious and taking 9 battle damage, while Rasmus loses nothing. Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
I cause 1 Force loss from Tatooine Occupation, drain for 1 at Wattos Junkyard and for 2 at Tatooine (+1 because Maul is there). I then drop Darth Vader With Lightsaber to Mos Espa, flip my objective, place a card face down to deal 2 damage (Rasmus had no Force saved), then move Vader over to the Junkyard for the re-flip.<br/>
<br/>
This goes on for a few turns, me causing 1 damage from the Occupation and draining for 3 total, while Rasmus drains me for 1 at Mos Espa. The Emperor (v) joins my gang at the Junkyard, but due to being on the 0-side of my objective, I cant benefit from Janus +1 to Force Drains (0-side limits drains at Tatooine sites to 1).<br/>
<br/>
After a few turns, Rasmus deploys Qui-Gon Jinn With Lightsaber to the Junkyard, and move Obi-Wan over from Mos Espa. We battle there, he swings at The Emperor (v) and misses, lose Qui-Gon to attrition and use A Jedis Resilience to take him back into hand, then move Luke over from Mos Espa.<br/>
<br/>
From here on out, nothing interesting happens. I drain and do damage with Occupation, while Rasmus has no notable damage going. Full win.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 2-0, Victory Points: 4.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 3: Watto vs. Casper Jørgensens Profit/Advantage (v)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Casper is a fellow Copenhagen player, and also the one Ive been playtesting with leading up to the Nationals. Hes the only one here who knows my deck, and I in turn know his pretty well too. So of course fate would have it that we square off in the tournament as well. Im pretty confident that I can take his Profit deck, even despite the fact that Casper is one of the best players in my local community, and often ends up in first or second place at our tournaments. His deck relies heavily on hitting my guys, using Advantage (v) to reduce my total power, and cause large amounts of overflow. Having playtested against this exact deck, I know how dangerous it can be, and as a result I play 2 Cease Fire as well as 2 Imperial Barrier, so Im not too worried about an Advantage-fuelled beatdown.<br/>
<br/>
Casper starts You Can Either Profit By This, Tatooine: Jabbas Palace and Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber, with Han (v) frozen there, then plays HFTMF to deploy Seeking An Audience (v), Quick Draw (v) and I Must Be Allowed To Speak (v). I deploy Mara Jade With Lightsaber and Dr. Evazan (not the Ponda Baba combo, good ol Premiere Evazan) to the Audience Chamber with his objectives game text, and then put out the same cards as in my previous game against Rasmus.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of the game, I pull Admiral Ozzel with Endor Shield (v), and Casper plays The Professor from under his starting effect. I activate, then pull Watto from Reserve with the Junkyard, deploy Ozzel to Mos Espa, bluff a card for 2 Force loss, deploy Tatooine system from hand, play ComScan Detection (v) to deploy the Death Star: War Room (v), move Ozzel over to the Junkyard (flip back to 0-side), move Mara and Evazan over to Jabbas Palace and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Casper uses Seeking An Audience (v) to deploy Threepio With His Parts Showing to the Audience Chamber, uses I Must Be Allowed To Speak (v) to deploy the generic Farm, placing it between the Junkyard and Mos Espa, and uses Quick Draw (v) to deploy Saitorr Kal Fas (v). Then he decides to go on the offense right away. He drops Leia, Rebel Princess to the Junkyard, and deploys Leias Blaster Rifle on her. I havent got a Cease Fire nor an Imperial Barrier in hand yet, and I also havent gotten out my Breached Defenses &amp; Molator combo (to protect against character being lost during battle), so this could be bad for me. He battles, shoots and hits Watto, who is immediately lost, draw destiny, and I end up having to lose Ozzel and take 2 battle damage.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that was bad, but I have a comeback ready for Casper. I notice that he didnt have any Force left in his Force Pile, and since Leias Blaster Rifle costs 1 to fire, I can attack her without him being able to shoot my guys. And it just so happens that I have another Watto (v) and a Darth Vader With Lightsaber in hand. I drop both of them to the Junkyard, and deploy Janus Greejatus to Mos Espa, flipping my objective and bluffing a card for 2 Force loss. I then battle Leia, Vader hits with his Lightsaber, and Casper cant shoot back. He also doesnt get a battle destiny due to the Junkyards game text (because Watto is there), so he ends up losing Leia and taking 10 battle damage. Not bad for my 2nd turn. I then move Janus over to join Mara and Evazan at Jabbas Palace, flip back to the 0-side and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
Casper drops Captain Yutani With Blaster Cannon to the deserted Audience Chamber, and I respond by playing the Come Here You Big Coward shield, preventing him from retrieving any Force, if he should choose to free Han at this time. He then drops Chewie, Enraged (v) to the Farm. He uses Saitorr Kal Fas (v) to deploy Chewbaccas Bowcaster, and since he now occupies two battlegrounds to negate the effects of my Coward shield, opts to free Han, retrieving 5 Force. He then puts Tatooine Utility Belt (v) on Han, and end his turn. <br/>
<br/>
I drop The Emperor (v) to Mos Espa, flip and cause more damage with my objective. I reveal Saber 1 from hand with Combat Response, but fail to find either of my two Baron Soontir Fels, so it remains in hand. The Emperor moves over to Jabbas Palace, where he joins up with Mara, Evazan and Janus, and I end the turn.<br/>
<br/>
For a few turns, we just sit there exchanging drains and direct damage via our objectives. At one point, a bunch of Caspers characters find themselves at Tatooine: Jabbas Palace against my squad there. I play Disarmed during my control phase, then immediately operate with Dr. Evazan to cause Chewie to be lost. A few battles take place, but the most prominent moment during the late game is when Casper moves all his guys (Yutani, Han, Ben Kenobi, possibly one more) over from the Audience Chamber to Tatooine: Jabbas Palace, to try and block my drain there. Casper too late realizes that he hasnt yet got Hans Heavy Blaster Pistol on Han (it adds 2 to his defense value), and since hes only defense value 3, I zap him with Emperor, causing his objective to flip back. <br/>
<br/>
Casper now has no damage at all going against me. On his last turn of the game, he retrieves Chewie, Enraged (v) by placing Seeking An Audience (v) out of play, and deploys him in front of my guys at Jabbas Palace. In a last show of audacity, he battles my overwhelming force there, shoots and hits Emperor, and as were forfeiting, plays End of a Reign to draw destiny and make me lose that much Force. He only draws a 2 though, but even if hed drawn a 7, it wouldnt have made a difference, as he then proceeds to lose his remaining Life Force, either from battle damage, or my next turn drain. Full win.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 3-0, Victory Points: 6<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 4: Rebel Senate vs. Gunnar Brandéns GalDom/Emperors Power</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Gunnar and I are the only two who are currently undefeated, and so we face each other in the fourth game. After this, whoever wins will be alone in first place. Gunnar is from Sweden, and unlike his two buddies Kristoffer and Antti, Ive never met him before. He seems a pleasant enough guy, and we both wish each other luck, but not too much luck, and get the game underway.<br/>
<br/>
I start my usual stuff, while Gunnar just starts the Death Star II: Throne Room, then plays According To My Design to deploy The Emperor (v) there, and also puts out Breached Defenses &amp; Molator, Ill Take Them Myself and Tarkins Bounty (v).<br/>
<br/>
Since Gunnar played According To My Design, I get to start the game. I have a Might of the Republic in hand, and use it to fetch Bail Organa, Father of Rebellion. I then take Senator Mon Mothma into hand with Strike Planning, and thinking myself relatively safe on the ground vs. GalDom (as Ive guessed from his Ill Take Them Myself effect), deploy them both to Senate to flip. This would soon prove a mistake. I use Mon Mothmas game text to pull the Coruscant: Nightclub, deploy it so that the Senate location is in between it and the Jedi Council Chamber, and end my turn.<br/>
<br/>
On Gunnars first turn, he pulls Emperors Power with his Throne Rooms game text, then, as Id expected, uses Ill Take Them Myself to get Galactic Domination. After deploying Emperors Power and GalDom, he uses it to put out Executor: Meditation Chamber, draw some cards and end his turn.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I do my usual trick of activating 3 Force, using Wokling (v) to pull Senate Hovercam, then activate my remaining Force. I deploy the Hovercam, and move straight on to my draw phase, where I play a NOOOOOOOOOOOO! to take a card from Force Pile into hand, draw a few additional cards, and say go. Before my turn ends, Gunnar plays Alter (v) to cancel my Senate Hovercam. Bummer! Well, at least I got the Nightclub out, so Im not completely deprived of Force.<br/>
<br/>
This is where Gunnar makes me realize that Ive misjudged his deck completely. Its not a space deck at all, its just a ground deck that utilizes GalDom as an activation base. After pulling Executor: Holotheatre with GalDom, he drops Myn Kyneugh (v) and Kir Kanos With Force Pike to my Senate, initiate battle and add a battle destiny with Emperors Power. He clears me off the site, and loses Myn Kyneugh (v) himself, leaving Kir Kanos there alone.<br/>
<br/>
I play Might of the Republic (which Gunnar grabs with A Tragedy Has Occurred) to get a new Bail, Father of Rebellion into hand, in case I want to make a counterattack at the Senate. However, with Mon Mothma lost and no way to retrieve her currently (Coward shield is in effect), it looks like Ill have to relinquish the Senate to him for the time being. I drop Obi-Wan Kenobi (v) and his Lightsaber to the Nightclub, and settle in for the possibility of a drain race, unassisted by my political effect, which is useless if I cant occupy the Senate. In hindsight, I realize that Obi-Wans game text may not be cancelled, and thus I should have used him to battle off Myn Kyneugh, as hed retain his immunity to attrition.<br/>
<br/>
Gunnar deploys the Tatooine system, and puts Colonel Jendon In Onyx 1 there with a SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons, as well as Onyx 2 (v). He pulls Fanfare (v) with Onyx 2, and uses it to pull Protocol Failure. End turn.<br/>
<br/>
I drain at Nightclub, and he responds by first playing After Her! there, then cancelling the drain with Protocol Failure. Expecting an upcoming battle, I deploy Yoda, Master of the Force to the Nightclub, equipped with a Jedi Lightsaber (v).<br/>
<br/>
As I guessed, Gunnar was ready to attack me. He drops Stormtrooper Garrison, Darth Vader With Lightsaber and Carnor Jax, Royal Guard there. I had two Sorry About The Mess &amp; Blaster Proficiency in hand, which I would have liked to use to make his guys lost during the battle, but due to Gunnars Breached Defenses &amp; Molator, they were about as useful as S-Foils on a Tauntaun. End result: Site cleared on both sides, no battle damage for either player.<br/>
<br/>
From here on on, we end up battling over the Nightclub for the rest of the game, neither ever really gaining a permanent foothold there. Meanwhile, Gunnar is pinging away at me with drains at Tatooine. At one point, I drop Han, Chewie and the Falcon there, dont battle, maintain it and save 1 Force (I have Life Debt in hand, while he has First Strike on table). Reason I didnt battle was that the real goal of dropping the Falcon there was to block his drain. If he didnt have more starships in hand, hed have a hard time clearing me without losing his entire space presence himself. However, he drops Devastator (v) and initiates battle. He didnt expect the Life Debt though, so the end result is the same, system is cleared. I drop Home One to Tatooine after this, but he hits me with another Jendon/Onyx1/Onyx2 plus added destiny from Emperors Power, and I have to lose the ship and eventually the game as well. Full loss.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 3-1, Victory Points: 6.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 5: Watto vs. Gunnar Brandéns Local Uprising (v)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
The previous game almost went to time, so while Im still busy cursing myself for playing like an idiot in that game, next rounds pairings are announced, and Im up against Gunnar again. I cant allow him to win both of these games, or he will pull too far ahead, while the rest of the players below us in the standings will catch up or overtake me. I have to win this one!<br/>
<br/>
Gunnar reveals Local Uprising (v), smiles sheepishly and says that it was the only even halfway decent Light Side deck he had, even though he doesnt expect much from it. Well, a little quick math shows that this being game 5, and him being undefeated, the deck must have been strong enough to beat at least 2 opponents. All my sites are exterior, and those speeders with matching pilot draw battle destiny unless able to otherwise, meaning theyll be able to pose a real threat at the Junkyard, even with Watto there.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the sites required by the objective (Main Power Generators (v), Hoth system and 4th Marker), Gunnar also deploys Echo Base Garrison and Maneuvering Flaps &amp; Nick of Time with the objective, and plays HFTMF to deploy Strike Planning and two other effects that I dont recall. As you will be able to tell, from here on out I didnt have time in between games to take notes, and thus the next couple of games are being written purely off one-week old memory, and as such will be far less detailed than the previous 4 games.<br/>
<br/>
I deploy my usual stuff, take Ozzel and Veers into hand with Endor Shield, deploy Tatooine from hand, then drop both Watto (v) (from Reserve Deck with Junkyards game text) and Ozzel. For some reason, Gunnar waits to pull the Professor shield until his own turn, so that leaves me with two extra Force available (since both Ozzel and Watto are now free to deploy), which I draw, after moving Ozzel to join Watto and dealing direct damage with the bluff card.<br/>
<br/>
Gunnar sets up General Carlist Rieekan (v) on Hoth, and gets some sites out, while taking various Rogue pilots into hand with Echo Base Garrison (Commander Wedge and Commander Luke at least, dont think he had Zev and Hobbie).<br/>
<br/>
I set up Maul in his ship at Tatooine, not expecting him to have any ability &gt; 3 pilots other than Luke, and if he puts Luke in space, Im safe to control the ground. I get Tatooine Celebration set up on my 2nd turn, and as expected he never challenges me in space, letting the Occupation and Mauls drain do their damage for the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
Gunnar seems to be having trouble finding his Rogue 1 and/or Rogue 3, as theyre often hiding in his Force Pile. This gives me time to do some serious damage with my objective, before he finally finds Rogue 1, and Commander Luke comes down to chase me off the Junkyard. I move my surviving guys over to Mos Espa, meanwhile invading Hoth with Darth Sidious and Darth Vader With Lightsaber moving in underneath the shield.<br/>
<br/>
Snowspeeder Garrison comes down to chase Vader off Hoth, then moving in front of Sidious to block my drain there. However, between the 2-drain at Tatooine, constant ping for 1 from Occupation and the few drains I did manage to get in on Hoth, its too little too late, and I end up taking the win. I dont recall whether it was timed or regular, but since we play by the Strength of Schedule system, that didnt matter much, as I got my 2 victory points.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 4-1, Victory Points: 8<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Game 6: Rebel Senate vs. Angelo Consolis Build-A-Vader Hunt Down (v)</u></b><br/>
<br/>
After trading wins, Gunnar and I are now once again tied in first place on Victory points, while Angelo has also gone 4-1 so far, making it a three-way tie for the top spot. Gunnar gets to face Kristoffer Hedlund, who is currently 3-2. Due to having a better SoS score, it seems clear that no matter the outcome of Gunnar and Kristoffers game, it will be Gunnar in the Final Confrontation, versus whoever wins between myself and Angelo, so were all pretty excited as we start off the last regular game of the Championship tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Angelo flips over Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi (v), which is pretty much what I expected, from having met him previously. He puts out Rise Of The Dark Lord, Gift of the Master and Combat Response (v). On his first turn, he uses A Siths Plans to deploy the 3rd Marker Hoth site, and on his second turn he drops Darth Vader, More Machine Than Man there, with his Lightsaber, and the Vaders Cape (v) effect from underneath Rise Of The Dark Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that my Senate is very prone to getting cleared by mains decks, I decide to not rush into anything this time, and on my first turn, I just pull Mon Mothma, and draw most of my Force Pile into hand. I then put out Battle Plan to make Angelo pay if he wants to start doing early drains.<br/>
<br/>
A few turns into the game, I decide to deploy my senators and flip, to start using Bails tunnel vision ability and properly set up my hand to battle his mains.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I dont remember much detail about this game anymore. I hit him at Hoth with Mace Windu (v), and managed to hit Vader, despite having the +2 defense value from Vaders Cape (v). We had 3 meaningful battles throughout the game, and as Angelo can surely testify to, he just had the downside of every one of them. On one hand, Ill give this to the fact that my deck is very much geared towards staying power, keeping my guys on table, while taking his guys off it. On the other hand though, Angelo had some really bad luck drawing destiny this game. Whenever he was lucky enough to battle without me having either a Swing-And-A-Miss, Blaster Deflection, Sorry About The Mess combo, or similar card in hand, he just drew so low that it didnt matter if Id had the cards or not. Three times he tried attacking me, twice in the Nightclub and once on Hoth, and each time, his side of the location was completely cleared, and I always had one or more characters standing afterwards. Between that, and using Jedi Levitation (v), Seeking An Audience (v) and A Jedis Resilience to get my guys back, it was an uphill battle for Angelo. One he eventually lost. Full win.<br/>
<br/>
Wins/loses: 5-1, Victory Points: 10.<br/>
<br/>
So at the end of the regular rounds, I was 5-1. Kristoffer beat Gunnar in their final game, meaning that Kristoffer, Gunnar and Angelo were all 4-2 and tied in 2nd place before calculating SoS scores. Since Gunnar had met, and defeated all the rest of the top 4, we were pretty sure he was going to be the one going through, and indeed he was, although he and Angelo were practically neck and neck. I think the only thing that separated them was that Gunnar played me twice, and with 10 points in 6 games, I was worth a little more SoS score than Angelos opponents. Thus, the Final Confrontation would be between myself and Gunnar. Having 1 win and 1 loss against each other in regular play, this was going to be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
We all take a short break to award prizes to 3rd - 12th place. Originally, the plan for the Final Confrontation was that one of the other guys sister was going to show up and video tape the two games in order to post the finals on YouTube. However, it seemed like that wasnt going to happen anyway, so after delaying a bit to figure out what exactly was going on, we settled down for the final two games of the National Championship tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Being the higher-scoring player after regular play, I got to pick my side first, and I chose to start with Dark, as that was the deck Id beaten Gunnar with earlier.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Final Confrontation, Game 1: Watto vs. Gunnar Brandéns Local Uprising (v).</u></b><br/>
<br/>
We set up the same way as in our previous game, and get the Final Confrontation under way. I pull Ozzel with Endor Shield (v) and again Gunnar elects not to play the Professor until his own turn, so I get Ozzel and Watto (v) down for free, cause him to lose 2 Force with my objectives 7-side, and move together at Junkyard. Same ol, same ol.<br/>
<br/>
This time however, Gunnar has more luck getting his Rogue speeders early. He sets up Rieekan as normal, but other than that he completely abandons Hoth to invade Tatooine. Once Luke is on the ground, Im again safe to deploy Mauls Sith Infiltrator with Darth Maul piloting it to Tatooine, and get Tatooine Occupation set up again. This time however, Gunnar hits me hard, clearing most of whatever guys I had deployed on Tatooine, with Luke and Wedge in their speeders. I move the rest of my guys from Junkyard over to Mos Espa, but on his next turn, Gunnar moves Rogue 3 with Commander Wedge piloting over there. Both Rogue 1 and Rogue 3 also has a Veteran Rogue on board, so they are power 8ish, plenty of forfeit and immune to attrition &lt; 6. I cant compete with them, and unfortunately I have no 6es in my deck at all, except Mauls ship, which is already in play, so I cant kill his guys without a destiny adder. The only guy I have who can draw more than 1 destiny is General Veers (v), but Gunnar is prepared for AT-ATs and has both Power Harpoons and Dual Laser Cannons on his speeders. I end up having to land the Mist Hunter (v) (piloted by Zuckuss) to pick up Watto and whoever else hes hanging out with and fly them off the planet, to prevent a huge beatdown.<br/>
<br/>
From that point on, its a drain race. I have Saber 1 with the Baron piloting at Tatooine, and Mauls ship is over at Hoth. Gunnar has Gold Squadon 1 piloted by General Calrissian and Chewie (v) in the air, and for a while we chase each other around, until he just settles for it being parked in front of Maul, with ability = 0, while I drain at Tatooine for 1 with the Baron. After the game, he told be he didnt want to risk moving in front of the Baron anymore, for fear that I might have some extra ships or a tracked destiny, and blow him out of the air. We swap drains for a while, but his drains on my Tatooine sites eventually get the better of me, and he drains me out after Ive done as much damage as I possibly can.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss (-8)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so going into game 2, I know that I need to win by 9 or more. Not impossible, but I have to seriously revise my gameplan from our first game, where he ended up clearing me completely off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Final Confrontation, Game 2: Rebel Senate vs. Gunnar Brandéns GalDom/Emperors Power.</u></b><br/>
<br/>
We both start the same cards as previously, but this time Im more aware of what his deck aims to do. Which is, battle on the ground, with added destinies from Emperors Power.<br/>
<br/>
I go first again, due to According To My Design, and pull my senators into hand as usual. However, this time I keep them in hand, rather than risk losing them early. Gunnar sets up his activation engine with GalDom, and we both kinda just wait each other out, letting the other person make the first move.<br/>
<br/>
I decide to deploy Mon Mothma and Bail, flipping my objective, but this time backing them up with Yoda, Master of the Force and a Jedi Lightsaber (v). I get out Coruscant: Nightclub, but decide to not deploy the Coruscant system this game, as I think he has me beat in space.<br/>
<br/>
Its seems that putting Yoda with the senators helps, because as I recall, I stayed flipped most of the game. I might have gotten cleared off the Senate once, but I know I had So This Is How Liberty Dies up and running later on, so I must have had some presence in there at least. The game quickly evolved into a drain race. I was draining for 4-5 in the Nightclub, further enhanced by Gunnar having attempted the After Her! trick again, but this time failed to clear me off the site, letting me keep the +1 drain from his card for the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
Im sorry that I dont remember any particular details about this final game. I had Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) with Lukes Lightsaber draining at the Nightclub, eventually backed up by Yoda who moved over from the Senate. Every time Gunnar came at me, I had some kind of defensive interrupt ready, and when he did manage to clear my Luke, I got him back through using either A Jedis Resilience or Seeking An Audience (v). And every time, I took his guys out with me when I did have to lose Luke. Yoda never left table, so even when I did lose Luke, Yoda was there to drain on my next turn.<br/>
<br/>
One battle I do remember, almost had me thinking I was going to lose this match. He had Jendon In Onyx 1 and Onyx 2 at Tatooine system, and I came down at him with Han, Chewie and the Falcon and Gold Leader in Gold 1 (v) when he had no Force left to draw destiny against Gold Leader. I only had 2 Force left in my Force Pile, and used 1 to initiate battle vs. his guys. I managed only to kill one of them I think, and Im sure Gunnar was relishing the though of a counterbeat on Gold Leader after I didnt have enough Force left to pay for the Falcons maintenance cost. However, I then played a Visored Vision (v) used, to activate 5 Force since Gunnar had 3 non-battleground locations on table. I then drew a card, paid the Falcons maintenance, and passed the turn.<br/>
<br/>
Little did I know that he had another Colonel Jendon in Onyx 1 in hand. He dropped the ship, deployed an SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons on it, and battled me. Ouch, this looks bad! He used 3 Force to fire the cannon with X=3, hitting my Falcon and causing it to be immediately lost. He then added a destiny with Emperors Power, for a total of 3 battle destiny, against my power 4 Gold Leader who didnt get destiny. I end up taking 12 battle damage from that fight.<br/>
<br/>
That was a bad blow, but I was determined to not let it break me. I focused on maintaining my presence at Nightclub, and with the big 4-5 per turn drain going on there, I quickly caught back up to Gunnar, who only had a drain of 1 going at Tatooine. The endgame was purely draining as much as possible, while Gunnar tried to block my drains enough to catch up on remaining Life Force. However, in the end, it wasnt enough, and I ended up draining him out with 10 Life Force left.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win (+10)<br/>
<br/>
Phew. I did it I actually won the National Championship. And by as slim a margin as 2 petty Force differential. Wow that was an exciting two games. Id like to thank Gunnar for an amazing 4 games total over the course of the tournament. He was truly an amazing opponent to play against. He made little to no mistakes over the four games we played. And this despite the fact that he had a whole bottle of Grants whiskey with him for the entire day, that he was regularly drinking from! Anyone who can drink whiskey for 8+ hours straight, and still play a flawless game deserves my utmost respect!<br/>

In addition to the National Champion title, I also ended up with a bye for day 2 at Worlds 2012 in Europe, a great-looking trophy, and a brand new V-card design. Lots of cool prizes (booster packs, rare- and foil cards, t-shirts and other nice SWCCG commodities were randomized between all the remaining participants, so everyone went home with something. The general mood was great, and a bunch of us went out to celebrate the successful tournament with a bunch of beers in the local Copenhagen nightlife. To all of those guys, as well as to those who went directly home after the tourney: Thanks for a great day, once again helping the European community make a name for itself on the international SWCCG scene! And a very special thanks to Kristian Lund, our drunken TD, for running an awesome, albeit not entirely sober, event <br/>
<br/>
Before I end my Tournament Report, Id like to draw attention to an interesting little tidbit here I have been to a grand total of 2 National Championships here in Denmark. The first one was in 2001, shortly before I quit the game for 8 years. I made it to the Final Confrontation, which I lost by a total differential of -5 to Jonas Nørregaard, and at the end of my TR from that tournament, heres what I wrote: <br/>
<br/>
Well, the Danish National Champion kept his title for another year but beware Jonas, Ill be there to take it away from you. Next time, I will succeed. <br/>
<br/>
Well, a few months after that Championship tournament, I quit the game, only to return in December of 2009. Since there was no National Championship held in 2010, this is, in fact, the first National Championship tournament held while Ive been an active player, since that 2001 tourney. And I was there to take the Championship and so I did! It all proceeded as I had foreseen ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough boring anecdotes and ramblings. I hope youve enjoyed reading this tournament report as must as Ive enjoyed writing it. Until next time <br/>
<br/>
May the Force be with you!<br/>
