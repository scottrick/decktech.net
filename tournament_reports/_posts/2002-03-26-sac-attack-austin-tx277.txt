<br>
Time once more for an Austin TR...because yes, I have too much damn time on my hands. This week’s TD was none other than Jeremy Losee, running his second event here in Austin. <br>
<br>
In the three weeks since the last local, I didn’t do much with my cards...until Spring Break arrived and I decided to put my school-related agenda in the back seat until after the tourney. In the last event, I played Senate for both allegiances - an EPP Hit-and-Run deck for LS and TIEs for dark because LSC is frickin’ huge here. I refined both decks a bit, and decided to stick with them. I playtested some with Matt Lush, who tried to build several various decks, none of which met any success against mine. He became a bit apathetic toward the upcoming tourney, and didn’t know if he’d even attend. <br>
<br>
On Friday, I called Matt up to hear his decision about attending the tourney (because I always drive) and he informs that he is indeed coming thanks to a last-minute babysitter. He decides to build two new decks because he doesn’t want to use my extra ones (WYS and Hunt Down) which are in Jeremy’s hands anyway in case he needs to play in order to avoid an odd amount of players. I tell Matt to be at my place at 9 a.m., and we’re set to roll. <br>

LS: Senate Hit And Run <br>
DS: Senate TIEs <br>

[Game 1] <br>
LS vs. Matt Lush (1970) BHBM w/ SAC <br>
Well well. I face Captain SAC and his new dark deck in the opening game (great way to pair, Jeremy!). I have no real clue about the deck he’s playing other than the fact that it’s BHBM and he was initially trying to start with They Must Never Again Leave This City...until Jeremy told him during the drive up that he can’t start with it. He starts IAO combo, Mob Points, and First Strike, I think. He begins activating before using Mob Points, so I pull the DDTA shield. On his opening turn he grabs a couple DBs, plays Bad Feeling Have I (dah!) and drops Empy from reserve maybe. I deploy Senators and the Hovercam, and flip fairly early. I pull the Grabber shield because I do in every game, and the Battle Plan shield to hinder his drains. Whoops. There goes all three shields. Damn that SAC happy bastard, why the hell did I just do that? What’s that? An Alter on my Hovercam? DAMMIT. Must...remember...to...auto-pull...SAC...shield...against...Matt. Oh well, no red cards for me. But the lack of the Hovercam (combined w/ BFHI) crippled my deck more than I could imagine, as he established an enormous activation advantage and deployed a huge amount of stuff on the table, while I couldn’t afford to do what my deck does -- beatdown. But he knew exactly how to play against my LS deck, avoiding my deck’s battling capabilities by not spreading his forces. I can’t do much but deploy EPP Luke and EPP Obi to my Naboo DB in order to return the drains. But, he responds with EPP Maul, Dr. E combo, and Super Fett. Ick. I wind up losing Luke and 7 overflow after Maul cuts Obi and Evazan operates on him. That pretty much clinched my light deck’s first loss in tourney play, and my first loss since FCon. <br>

"Hello? 911? I’ve been attacked by an incredibly large SAC! Help!" <br>
<br>
[Game 2] <br>
DS vs. Matt Lush (1970) Twix Mains Pile...with SAC! <br>
We somehow get paired again because DS apparently owned in that round. He starts with the JCC, and his three starting effects are DTF, Colo, and Another Pathetic Lifeform, I believe. He attacks the Senate using Savrip to back him up, but I have a Guard and like 4 Senators in there, so he decides to use his Savrip bait elsewhere. He comes to space with Home One, and then with Tantive IV (???) and several piloting mains. I just run from his ships because I don’t have much in the deck for capitals (who the hell plays all capitals in a LS deck?). But, I retrieve and drain for small amounts, while he can drain for very little thanks to the political effect and his lack of any battleground sites. I have the upper hand after several turns of retrieval and draining...and battles in space begin. I form a small stream of manipulation via the continously retrieved Monnok and the Objective swiping two cards from his hand, but he is able to keep enough Savrip fodder to survive. He of course is playing SAC...but the There Is No Try shield was played on the opening turn. I continue to retrieve since I’m losing TIEs through battling, and his deck starts to run thin on cards. He hasn’t payed upkeep on two of his characters (Lando and Chewie) for like the entire game, and I finally catch on during the last several turns. He forgets again and draws up, but I catch it and put them both OOP. Time expires, as do his options, but he chooses to draw up his remaining few cards to give me a full win...which was a damn cool thing to do. <br>
Full Win by 13 <br>

"Nevermind...don’t send an ambulance...I have beaten the SAC into a shriveled state of submission."<br>

[Game 3] <br/>
DS vs. Zane Thorp (1679) HB Flip <br/>
Well damn. Once again I play HB Flip at an Austn local. That moves the streak to about 138097123897 consecutive tourneys now. Even at FCon I could not escape that silly deck. I actually played Zane’s HB Flip w/ my Senate TIEs at the last local, but he has since changed the deck tremendously. He starts off with non-combo Insurrection, Superficial Damage, and Squadron Assignments. He sets up fairly quickly with ships, but I make a point to get Yeb Yeb to the Senate in a speedious manner, and he arrives on like turn two or so via Squabble, I think. I start using him immediately, and I find a system on my second try. So, he never flips his Objective. But, he does spread his ships out, most of which are unique X-Wings armed with Cannons. An early verification of his deck revealed 3x A Few Maneuvers and 3x Barrier, so I was very hesistant to attack his ships. I do attack one ship early with a TIE/Cannon, but I think it was Barriered and shot down on his turn. Subsequently, a lost Monnok nets a pair of Barriers, thus my attacks resume and I manage to shoot down several ships despite a copy of A Few Maneuvers in his hand. I drain, while he does not. Yeb Yeb finds more good cards, like Red Squadron 1 and A Few Maneuvers. I Monnok him again and get his two Edges, I think...which essentially seals the deal. <br/>

[Game 4] <br/>
LS vs. Jacob Mayer (1947) DLS/JP Mains <br/>
Damn...Jake is STILL playing this deck. If only he had more time, he could be playing something more modern like Skrilling/Screw/Numbers or something. Heh. He doesn’t have the free Maul first turn, and he doesn’t pull Mara with the AC text, either. Instead, he saves some Force and later deploys Thrawn and a Stormtrooper Garrison to the Senate, then moves over to the JCC. At this point, I have the Hovercam up and running, so my activation is plentiful. And in my hand are Liea, Leia’s Rifle, EPP Obi, and EPP Luke. So I deploy all three of them to the JCC, one of whom he tried to Barrier, but I canceled it with the Bith Shuffle combo. The battle ensues, I stack a 3 on the Fish, and cap his Garrison with Leia’s Rifle. A lightsaber hits Thrawn, and he loses 14 overflow after declining to draw destiny...a damn good move on his part considering I have no way of getting my characters out of the JCC. He next begins to assemble his mains on Tatooine, while I realize that my remaining ground crew consists of only EPP Qui-Gon and Scoundrel Lando. He deploys Vader/Tarkin to a JP site, and Mara to another. I deploy R3 Yoda to my Naboo DB to circumvent his Coward shield, then drop EPP Qui against Mara. The ensuing battle costs him like 5 more overflow, and I Resilience Qui-Gon. He deploys another Mara, only to have Qui-Gon beat her down again for several more overflow. He’s pretty low on cards at this stage of the game, and another Qui-Gon pays a visit to Jabba’s Palace, this time with Scoundrel Lando. I battled again, but I can’t remember any specifics other than him losing more cards. He drew up shortly after. <br/>

[Game 5] <br/>
LS vs. Jacob Taylor (1669) Senate TIEs <br/>
Amazingly, I’ve only played Jacob once before in tourney play even though he’s attended like every Austin local for a year nearly. He’s seen the decklist for my LS before, and I based my DS after the Senate TIE deck he posted, so we are both well aware of what the other is playing. I have only one Senator in my opening hand, but I do have a We Wish To Board At Once, which will fetch the Bacta Tank (which in turn basically allows me to automatically take the Senate). I search for a DB on my first turn and notice that I have activated another Senator, Amidala, and Valorum. So of course I draw up. I can’t afford to commit to the Senate just yet, but I drop three characters there and the Tank on the third turn. Jacob does try to make a run for the Senate majority, but his attempt is thwarted and he essentially concedes the Senate to me. The loss of the Senate cripples Senate TIEs, because it relies heavily on Lott Dod and Tikkes. But Jacob did make a game of it, deploying a TIE/Cannon to Coruscant quickly. He can only draw a couple cards per turn, because he knows I pack multiples of the Falcon combo (and thus he was forced to save Force for the Cannon and DTF). He can’t draw systems to save his life, and I think I might have sent a couple to his Used Pile via my Objective. He deploys the Coward shield, like everyone does against my deck, and I can’t deal much damage to him at all, although I have his drain under control with my political effect. Although, I completely forgot to send the senator back into my deck on one turn, allowing him to get in a Motion Supported-enhanced drain. By mid-game, he is still in a desperate struggle to activate force, while I have finally found a Falcon combo. I have R3 Yoda sitting at my only battleground, the Naboo DB, so I can retrieve w/ DTF when battling him in space. I start the hit and run with the Falcon, but he shoots it down with no difficulty. I deploy Threepio, and deploy my second Falcon, battle, and retrieve the first copy with DTF. But he again shoots it down. Fighter Cover hits the table, so my chances of getting a beatdown through on his TIE become slim. But I keep trying, as Threepio + DTF is allowing me to attack him every turn with retrieved and tracked Falcons. I meet no success, and when he finally gets some systems out, I just drop the Falcon far away from him to satisfy Battle Plan. I continually take two cards from his hand in an attempt to stop him from deploying another TIE/Cannon pair on top of my Falcon. After just a couple turns, he no longer has enough Force to pay for Battle Plan, and he draws up as time is being called again (Senate decks aren’t the easiest decks to play...I find myself having to spend a lot of time planning out my turn so I don’t forget anything). <br/>
Full Win by 14 <br/>

[Game 6] <br/>
DS vs. Michael Richards (1817) LSC <br/>
Richards defeated Matt in the previous game to move into first place. The winner of this game would win the tournament, as we were the only two players remaining with only one loss. Fortunately for me, Richards was playing LSC. The only real reason I’m playing Senate TIEs is because it doesn’t lose to standard LSC. Richards informs me that he’s using Tim Guzman’s FCon LSC, which I got wrecked by back in November. Anyway, I establish control in the Senate early, while Richards draws because his hand is gay. I Monnok him when he has a huge hand and get a pair of EPP Lukes. I retrieve the Monnok with Seinar, and begin deploying systems and TIEs. I deploy Motion Supported and use it several times, and he plays an EP1 Alter on it (more SAC?). However, he pops a seven for destiny, and Motion Supported stays on the table. I don’t bother pulling the TINT shield because I know he isn’t playing much SAC, and I figure I can just retrieve the few cards he can cancel. He drains on Naboo, while I drop Ability, Ability, Ability to pressure him. He topdecks a Falcon combo to my drains, and he is never able to make a run at me in space. I continue to deal streams of damage, and comfortably win the drain race. <br/>
Full Win by 21 <br/>
10 (+78) <br/>
<br/>
Thus, I am victorious in the final standings, while Matt takes second place. Jacob Taylor finished third with his only losses to Matt and I. Jeremy of course keeps the foil I win, because he’s more corrupt than a local church. Heh. <br/>
<br/>
We finally head back home after Jeremy and I grab some food while Matt is playing a pick-up game. Jeremy once again becomes a joke whore from the back seat, and we’re back home before we know it. Can you guess what I did upon my return? You can rest assured that a lot of food and a Cypress Hill album were involved. Heh. <br/>
<br/>

Mary Jane.<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS: <br/>
Matt, for smacking me with his SAC. How many times do I have to tell you, dude? I’m not into that stuff. Homey don’t play dat. Heh.<br/>
Senate decks, for taking too long to play in tough games. <br/>
Ted, for storming out of the tournament in an outrage. But I have to admit I had a good laugh about it. <br/>
The Academy Awards, for robbing LOTR and Peter Jackson in broad day...er...spotlight. And Russel Crowe is a victim of affirmative action.<br/>
