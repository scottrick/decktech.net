<blockquote><font class="bfont"> DISCLAIMER: Okay, this report is super long and a little late, not to mention poorly formatted. I wrote it while I was working, so give me a break. Meanwhile, I realize this is the fourth or some such tournament report from MN States, but it is not my fault that we have a lot of highly literate Star Wars players in Minnesota.<br>
<br>
Tuesday night, my jedi training deck lost its first game to Tim Halverson. That<br>
had me a bit concerned. Sure, he was playing Hunt Down, and, sure, people keep<br>
telling me my jedi training deck is an auto-loss to Hunt Down and BHBM and<br>
everything else, but this was the first time I had questioned the effectiveness<br>
of my deck. There was a warm up tournament on Friday night, so I built a new<br>
light deck to test out, either to throw people off my scent or to develop a new<br>
deck that would have better odds against Hunt Down and BHBM. I was not certain<br>
what percentage of the players in the area would use those two objectives as<br>
opposed to the Scum, Ties and ISB that MWYHL absolutely kills. Friday, then, I<br>
brought a Tatooine Celebration deck built off the Hidden Base platform with<br>
docking bays and Staging Areas. It won the tournament, but I was concerned about<br>
how effective it would be against Scum since I couldn<br>
?t seem to fit Menace Fades<br>
in the deck. Also, it beat the Hunt Down Zach Stenerson had brought, but it was<br>
more a matter of luck than I would have liked. So, completely exhausted early<br>
Saturday morning after reminding myself to stay awake on the drive home, I<br>
settled on the MWYHL deck that has a counter for everything and is an auto-loss<br>
to everything, too, somehow, despite the fact that at this point it had a record<br>
of something like 15 to 1. And, yes, that included wins against BHBM and Hunt<br>
Down. Anyhow, that just left me to decide which dark side deck to play. I was<br>
going to go either with my Graces Vengeance AoBS deck or the ISB deck I had<br>
twiddled around with a few times. The ISB deck won the tournament earlier that<br>
evening, so it was rather tempting. But, I glanced back at a couple of my<br>
tournament reports on DeckTech and noticed that the AoBS deck, though slightly<br>
riskier, consistently won by a higher differential. So, I went with Graces<br>
Vengeance, and that proved to be the key to my success at the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Travis Bean had d-mailed me for a ride, so I had to get up about an<br/>
hour earlier than usual to drive out to the boonies to pick him up. Travis<br/>
actually lives on Boone Ave. You can not get more boonie-ish than that. I left<br/>
my apartment, then, at about, roughly, the crack of dawn and picked up Travis. On the way to Mirkwood, I<br/>
decided to run a small, cultural litmus test on our local boondocker, pointing out how when I went to a<br/>
neighbouring suburb in the recent past, I had noticed that all at the people at the Best Buy were deformed,<br/>
including the dude working the register who had snot hanging in a quarter-inch droplet from his razor-thin<br/>
nose. Travis acknowledged the trailer trash nature of the other suburb, so he passed test 1. Then I pointed<br/>
out how we were listening to the best in Finnish Club music, Bombfunk MC, and alluded to comments about<br/>
European MTV. Travis agreed that Europe was cool and American MTV sucks, so he got high marks on<br/>
the cultural litmus test and we drove on. We got to the tournament in time to turn in our deck lists. There<br/>
was about a half-hour left before the tournament, so Travis and I played a game of Warlord.<br/>
<br/>
When the tournament was set to go, Dion Erbes, the TD, addressed the new<br/>
Decipher rulings, tournament etiquette, etc. He called the pairings, and we<br/>
began.<br/>
<br/>
There were 42 players. Noticeable names included Mike Raveling, Josh Kohman,<br/>
Graham Neal, Garrett Larson and Justin Alfs.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, since I gave Travis Bean a ride, I ended up paired against him in the<br/>
first game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, my Save You It Can versus Travis Bean, Agents of the Black Sun<br/>
<br/>
Travis built a TIGIH that was nearly identical to mine and played that for a<br/>
number of tournaments. I was flattered. However, that led me to believe that his<br/>
AoBS deck would also be quite similar to mine. I asked him if he had managed to<br/>
acquire 6 Palpatines to make a Dark Surgeon copy, and he said he had not. So, I<br/>
commented that that was okay since my AoBS was better for our local meta anyway.<br/>
Travis said, Good. So I new what I was up against, but the problem was that when<br/>
I had tested my Vengeance against my Save You it Can, the Vengeance had won both<br/>
games, convincingly. Fortunately, I also knew how to play against my own<br/>
Vengeance deck, better, in fact, than Travis knew how to use it. Space was going<br/>
to be key. If I could get Honor to stop the damage from his objective and force<br/>
him to pay for his drains with Battle Plan, then I would be able to complete<br/>
Test 5, retrieve, and gain total control.<br/>
<br/>
So, I started with Insight instead of The Way of Things and scrapped that for<br/>
Honor as soon as he flipped. Travis set up by deploying a Presence of the Force<br/>
to the Imperial City for the first turn flip, then grabbing the Spaceport<br/>
docking bay on his next turn, moving Xixor over and deploying Palpatine to the<br/>
Imperial City. With Honor out, I was only taking the two force drain each turn<br/>
and focused on completing my tests and drawing for the SuperFalcon. Travis<br/>
started Crush to grab an Evader and Monnok combo, but I did not have any doubles<br/>
in my hand as I kept drawing to get the SuperFalcon. He played the Monnok used,<br/>
and I grabbed it. Travis then deployed a Presence of the Force on Carida and<br/>
established Zuckuss there along with 4Lom. The Monnok Travis had played had<br/>
kicked the Falcon out of my hand along with the Legendary Starfighter, but I<br/>
still had Captain Han, Leia with Blaster and the card of the game, Squadron<br/>
Assignments. So, just when Travis established his third battleground to get<br/>
around Honor while simultaneously getting past Battle Plan, I responded by<br/>
deploying Squassin, flashing Han to get the Falcon, backing him up with Leia and<br/>
blasting Zuckuss out of space. Unfortunately, Travis drew high enough to kill<br/>
both Han and Leia, so the Falcon became an empty shell at Carida. During my draw<br/>
phase, I pulled an Out of Commission and played it, removing Zuckuss from the<br/>
game. With Test 2 completed and Fett on the ground at Coruscant, I knew that<br/>
meant that Travis would not be able to draw a destiny in space. Melas deployed<br/>
to Carida on my next turn and established total space superiority.<br/>
<br/>
Travis, on the other hand, deployed en masse to Coruscant, backing up Xixor, and<br/>
then backing up the Emperor. By the time I drew Obi and the Lower Corridor,<br/>
Xixor, Guri, Fett, Palpatine, IG-88, Fett-wannabe and a Vigo or two were all<br/>
accounted for. Again, with Test 2 in play, Travis was going to have a difficult<br/>
time drawing a destiny against Obi, so I set him up at the Lower Corridor. Now,<br/>
I was draining for 4 for free, and Travis was paying 6 to drain for 2. I<br/>
completed my tests, getting a 7 on Test 5, retrieved and then started causing<br/>
damage with Test 6. The game sped up exponentially as Travis was unable to stop<br/>
the 6 damage I was causing him every turn while I was playing On the Edge to<br/>
retrieve all the force I was losing. That lasted only a couple of turns, and I<br/>
won by 32.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2, +32.<br/>
<br/>
High: Winning my first game against a deck that, like every other dark side<br/>
deck, should have been an auto-win against my light. Putting Zuckuss out of<br/>
play.<br/>
Lows: Travis killed both Han AND Leia in that battle.<br/>
Ugly: Travis later told me that, severaltimes, he saw No Escape in the 6 force<br/>
with which he was paying to drain. Dude, that is when you DRAW those 6 force.<br/>
<br/>
A light side win by 32 was only enough to get me into the second pairing. There,<br/>
I matched up against Josh Kohman, renewing the Battle of the Joshes. Kohman had<br/>
actually won the last game, with exactly the same deck match up. In that game, I<br/>
was not able to get out either of my anti-retrieval effects, and Kohman<br/>
retrieved everything he had lost, well over 60 force worth. That had prompted<br/>
the only change I made to the deck since I had removed all the Scanning Crews<br/>
that I could not play. After losing to Kohman, I switched out a fairly worthless<br/>
Hidden Weapons for another Twilek in order to grab my retrieval killers sooner.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, my Vengeance against Josh Kohman, Quiet Mining Colony<br/>
<br/>
An opening hand Emperor proved to be the key to the game. I deployed him to the<br/>
Guest Chambers and moved Xixor to the Spaceport DB since I had a second Xixor in<br/>
my hand. Kohman activated 6, dropped Obi with Saber against Xixor, used 1 to<br/>
search with QMC and then deployed Battle Plan and battled for free. Both our<br/>
characters died, but I took about 4 or 5 overflow in damage. On my next turn, I<br/>
drained and set up Xixor at a DB to flip again. Kohman deployed another Obi<br/>
against Palpatine and battled. He swung and missed. I played I Have You Now.<br/>
Palpatine won the battle, Obi died, and I lost a force with Young Fool to place<br/>
Obi out of play. That meant that Palpatine would be invulnerable except to Luke,<br/>
and Kohman would be pushing his luck to bring Luke against the Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
Battle Plan was slowing me down, but my drains and direct damage were still,<br/>
slowly but surely, eating away at Kohmans life force. Meanwhile, I was drawing<br/>
to get all the right cards into my hand while using A Dangerous Time to put all<br/>
the wrong cards into Kohmans hand. For example, all of Kohmans ships, or at<br/>
least 4 of them, were sitting at the bottom of his force pile while he would<br/>
have to draw above 12 cards in order to get at any of them. A Monnok used would<br/>
then limit his chances of successfully deploying any of them.<br/>
<br/>
So Kohman started playing desperately and made two mistakes that lost him the<br/>
game. Mistake 1: After I had drawn Zuckuss in MH and Bossk in HT and had begun<br/>
to save enough force to deploy them on the same turn to Bespin, Kohman deployed<br/>
characters at two CC sites and deployed Celebration to Bespin, betting that I<br/>
did not have any ships in my deck. Of course, on my next turn, I deployed my<br/>
ships and cancelled Celebration. Then, he made Mistake 2: On his next turn, he<br/>
deployed Luke to Bespin to flip my objective and then flashed Moff Wedge to get<br/>
his ship, or vice versa, deploying him against Zuckuss and Bossk. He then<br/>
double-checked his force pile, to find 2 force active. He asked me if he could<br/>
take back his deployment of Luke, but because I also saw 2 force active and was<br/>
thinking X-Wing Lasers, I had to say, No. Moff Wedge, then, had to run away. The<br/>
game then turned into a drain race with my 5 to Kohmans 2, and I already had a<br/>
good lead to begin with. At some point, I lost Secret Plans off the top of my<br/>
deck, but I was able to Twilek for Something Special. Regardless, my Dangerous<br/>
Times did their job effectively as Kohman was never able to draw his Edge cards.<br/>
Win by 18.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4, +50<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting revenge in the Battle of the Joshes. Opening hand Emperor.<br/>
Lows: Feeling like a bit of a jerk for not letting Kohman take back his<br/>
deployment of Luke.<br/>
Ugly: What was Josh thinking to deploy Celebration without ships to back it up?<br/>
<br/>
Lunch break at Wendys. When we get back Garrett Larson tells me how he and Tony<br/>
Lawrence were wrestling in the parking lot. Tony, apparently, spent a lot of<br/>
time making silly lunges at Garrett and bouncing off of him. I just shake my<br/>
head and think about how silly the whole situation is until Tony comes up to<br/>
Garrett, Justin Alfs and myself and starts talking about how Camerion Diaz is<br/>
ugly. Okay, I had to draw the line, there. Cameron Diaz may not be my favorite<br/>
female, but she is a far cry from ugly. Suddenly, as Tony continued to protest<br/>
his singular opinion, I understood why Garrett might want to toss Tony around<br/>
for a bit of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Garrett and Justin both know what I am playing since I told them.<br/>
They both saw the deck several times before, so there would not be any<br/>
surprises. And I know what they are playing since they told me. I got paired<br/>
against Justin for the third game, and he started praying that he would get to<br/>
play his BHBM against my jedi training. But it was not to be; I was dark side.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, my Vengeance against Justin Alfs, Spoiled Hopes TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
Justin and I playtested this game once or twice. Each time the outcome was the<br/>
same. I won. However, in each of those games I was able to get the Emperor down<br/>
to the Endor Landing Platform early in the game. But, this time, I was unable to<br/>
get a first hand Emperor, and with all the force Justin was going to activate, I<br/>
could not risk Xixor at a battleground until I backed him up with Guri. So that<br/>
stunk. On my first turn, I grabbed the Death Star docking bay and found the<br/>
Emperor was in my force pile, so I drew. Justin activated altogether a sickening<br/>
amount of force, grabbed A Dangerous Time when I played it, drained for one and<br/>
moved Luke over to the Landing Platform. Of course, I expected the turn to work<br/>
just like that, but it still stunk because now I was going to have to try to<br/>
kill Luke instead of plopping the Emperor down at the Landing Platform.<br/>
<br/>
Justin kept revealing his reserve deck to me by playing Throw Me Another Charge<br/>
and Fall of the Legend. He must have figured that since I built the deck he had<br/>
based his own design upon, he was not really giving away any secrets. However,<br/>
he was inadvertently revealing to me the location of his Fallen Portals. The<br/>
first two checks showed two Fallen Portals in the reserve deck. So I tried to<br/>
kill Luke with 4Lom and IG-88. Insertion Planning foiled my efforts, though, and<br/>
I stacked a card. The third check revealed no Fallen Portals in the reserve.<br/>
That meant that on my next turn, I was going to play Monnok lost. Which I did,<br/>
and I got both Fallen Portals.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, afraid to set up for the first several turns, I was falling behind in<br/>
the drain race. Not only was I behind in the drain race, but I knew that even<br/>
though I had both Something Special Planned and Secret Plans in play, Justin was<br/>
going to retrieve 10 force over the course of the game. Additionally, he played<br/>
Battle Plan and set up the mini-Falcon along with Moff Wedge and Blount in Red 6<br/>
at Endor. Endor was, then, death to my starships.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to do more damage than Justin, and unable to kill off Luke with wussy<br/>
attacks, I was forced to slowly accumulate a sufficient strike force at the<br/>
Death Star docking bay to transit over and confront Justins forces at the<br/>
Landing Platform. Eventually, Xixor, Guri, Snoova, a couple of Vigos and maybe<br/>
another character or two squared off against Luke and company. And Justin made<br/>
the fatal mistake of the game. He ran Luke away. The Emperor seized the moment<br/>
to move over to the Landing Platform, and since Luke was crippled, I left his<br/>
massed forces alone and move the rest of my guys to the Death Star docking bay<br/>
to drain. Since Justin had deployed everything but the kitchen sink at Endor, I<br/>
deployed Zuckuss in MH at Carida to get past Battle Plan. Suddenly, I was<br/>
draining for 4 a turn to the 1 for which Justin was plinking me. Even with the<br/>
early lead he had established and his retrieval, the game was slipping away from<br/>
him, so he attempted to battle me at the Death Star DB. He<br/>
 deployed Corran Horn,<br/>
and I Barriered him. Choosing not to battle without Corran Horn, he was stuck,<br/>
leaving me to initiate the battle on my turn. During my deploy phase I played<br/>
Put All Sections on Alert to cancel Obi with Sabers game text. I battled and<br/>
captured someone with Snoova with my first action, then captured someone with<br/>
IG-88 with my second action. The battle damage eliminated all of his characters<br/>
except Orrimarko, and I lost a Vigo.<br/>
<br/>
My drain of 4 was killing Justin quickly enough that he had to risk the<br/>
mini-Falcon against Zuckuss. But I had been holding Bossk in Bus for just such<br/>
an occasion. The battle was the last occurance of note, and the game ended<br/>
shortly. FW by 10.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6, +60<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning. It would have been embarassing to lose to a deck I designed.<br/>
Lows: 4Lom and IG-88 were given no mercy.<br/>
Ugly: Luke the Gimp spending the last 5 turns doing nothing, absolutely nothing,<br/>
at the spaceport docking bay.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, my Auto-Loss Versus Everything versus Andy Newton, Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Well, the odds makers had me at about 100 ? 1 on this game. After all, I was<br/>
training Luke. But the game was rather uneventful, and I dominated. Well,<br/>
actually, I was losing more force than Andy Newton for most of the game, but I<br/>
still dominated because I was not losing ENOUGH force to matter. With jedi<br/>
training, if I am not losing 3 or more force each turn before I flip, I am going<br/>
to win. Against Andy, I got Honor out on the first turn, and he never played No<br/>
Escape, nor did he occupy three battlegrounds to suspend Honor. Therefore, I<br/>
suffered no damage from Visage. Andy set up shop at one docking bay or another<br/>
with the only point of note about it being that it was not the Cloud City<br/>
docking bay, meaning, in essence, that if I was to put the Lower Corridor out<br/>
later in the game, Andy would not be able to walk over.<br/>
<br/>
So, the game was divided into three fairly distinct phases.<br/>
<br/>
Phase 1. Early game. Andy set up Vader at a docking bay as Hunt Down decks are<br/>
wont to do. I set up Honor and boldly took the 1 drain each turn while setting<br/>
up my jedi tests. He backed up Vader with some other folk, and I thought to<br/>
myself, He can have that docking bay.<br/>
<br/>
Phase 2. Mid game. Andy was still paying to drain all the time and still failing<br/>
to hit me with Visage damage. I decided it was time to deploy Kessel and Captain<br/>
Han in the Falcon since I was holding both Leia and I Know. I also deployed I ll<br/>
Take the Leader. Andy deployed Zuckuss and 4Lom against me and battled. I played<br/>
I Know. Andy cancelled it with Scruffy Looking Nerfherder. Say what? How is<br/>
that, again? And I could not find a Who s Scruff Looking? for the life of me.<br/>
Mainly because I do not have one in the deck. That was cool, though. Anyhow, I<br/>
was set to lose Han and the Falcon when I realized, Hey, I have completed Test<br/>
2. So, maybe I did not get a destiny, but neither did Andy. So I won the battle.<br/>
6 power to 2. Andy tossed away 4 force, and on my next turn I deployed Leia to<br/>
the Falcon. I could not initiate battle since Their Fire Has Gone Out was on the<br/>
table, but neither was I going to take a beating. Andy deployed some other stuff<br/>
to space on his next turn and battled. My destiny cleared out his site, but the<br/>
10 destiny he drew broke my immunity of 9 and, though I was able to play<br/>
Legendary Starfighter, my Falcon was empty.<br/>
<br/>
Phase 3. End game. So I ended up completing Test 5, but my two tracked 7-destiny<br/>
cards were too far down to reach to get on Test 5 and not far down enough to<br/>
activate enough to retrieve 10 with the flip since Andy had Secret Plans out. I<br/>
only had about 10 or 11 in my lost pile and an On the Edge in my hand, so I<br/>
decided to get the tracked Artoo in Red 5 that was exactly 9 cards down. Stupid<br/>
Secret Plans. I flipped with the permanent 0 or 7 and played On the Edge with<br/>
some rebel or another to retrieve 6 on my next turn. I got Han back into the<br/>
pilots seat of the Falcon. Luke and Obi squared off against Vader and whomever<br/>
Andy had with him. Luke completed Test 6 and became a Jedi. Andy, however,<br/>
decided to tech me out once again and played You Are Beaten on Luke to battle a<br/>
lone Obi-wan. He played I have you now, swung and chopped Obi and drew decent<br/>
destiny. I, like a moron, forgot to add my second destiny of 7 and took, yup,<br/>
exactly 7 overflow in the battle. Bah! Obi, however, cleared out Andys side of<br/>
the site, and those 7 overflow were the last force I would lose in the game. FW<br/>
by 11, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
FW 8, +71.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: What? I thought my deck was an auto-loss. Scruffy Looking Nerfherder.<br/>
Okay, so that was not my play, but it was too cool not to consider a game-high.<br/>
Lows: Not retrieving with Test 5.<br/>
Ugly: Empty shell of the Falcon causing Andy 2 damage each of his move phases.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, my differential kind of sucks. So I figure I have to win both of<br/>
my last games to make the final confrontation or win big and lose small. Sitting<br/>
at the top tables are Travis Bean who has staged a minor comeback, Josh Kohman,<br/>
Michael Raveling, Justin Alfs and Nick Jeninges. I think they were there, at any<br/>
rate. I was a little focused and introspective. Sitting at the top table against<br/>
the only other undefeated player, I faced off against Graham Neal.<br/>
<br/>
Graham had told me not long ago that he had added all sorts of tech to his decks<br/>
to be ready for my jedi training. He had a solid Hunt Down that would have been<br/>
a big problem, but I saw one of the cards from that deck sitting in a pile of<br/>
cards up for trade. That was good. That suggested to me that he would be playing<br/>
his reliable MKOS deck that was a fairly easy win for me with the only question<br/>
being the differential. But it was not to be. We sat down to play, and Graham<br/>
revealed ISB. And, to top off that surprise, it was not even the ISB Scum Graham<br/>
had turned into a wicked machine about a year ago. And to beat that, he started<br/>
with the Coruscant system suggesting a variant of Retardosaurus Rex, a deck<br/>
which is strong enough to set up a lock down against most decks but which runs<br/>
into trouble when it faces the only deck that actually locks down ISB, my jedi<br/>
training.<br/>
<br/>
So, that was keen.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, my Save You It Can Apocalyptic versus Graham Neal, ISB<br/>
<br/>
Graham had a poor, slow start, failing to draw either Piet or an Imperial<br/>
Command. He set up at his non-battleground docking bays for generation while I<br/>
started my training. When he set up a walker with an Outer Rim Scout, I grabbed<br/>
a Test and noticed that about two-thirds of my destiny were high enough to clear<br/>
the site with Obi and his stick. I battled and drew something high enough to<br/>
take out the walker and lost Obi, in turn. That left Graham to build back up<br/>
from scratch. The game seemed to move predictably enough with Graham trying to<br/>
establish a presence at the Endor DB and up in space. On the other hand, I just<br/>
kept training and picking away at his DB forces. Eventually, the I was able to<br/>
deploy the most expensive, least effective Falcon combo ever, consisting of<br/>
Lando with Axe and Leia with Blaster. A grabbed Command suggeted that I would be<br/>
relatively safe from an imminent beat-down since Graham would have to pay for<br/>
the ship, pilots, battle AND the Command. He deployed against me, Laterally<br/>
Damaged the Falcon, and battled. He did not have enough force for a Command, so<br/>
I played Punch It. I took out his ship, and Lando covered my damage. Shortly<br/>
thereafter, I completed Test 5 with a 7, retrieved my force and chased his space<br/>
fleet around with my SuperFalcon, choosing not to bother cancelling Lateral<br/>
Damage since I was at least a power of 21 in any battle, 35 if I may have<br/>
happened to have I Know in my hand. Test 6 started causing Graham some damage,<br/>
and before we knew it, there were only 7 minutes left in the game. That was<br/>
impossible. I had no idea so much time had passed. I had completely forgotten to<br/>
pay attention to time since I had never thought I would time out against Graham.<br/>
Meanwhile, I had only hit him for a couple force loss through the course of the<br/>
game and he was still draining me for 4 each turn at Fondor, Sullust and<br/>
Kashyyk. Then only 2 minutes were left, and it seemed like nothing had changed<br/>
except that the Falcon had stared down the Executor and about 4 other ships, and<br/>
I had had to lose Leia while he lost about 3 ships. I deployed Melas to the<br/>
Falcon and chased him around some more, realizing that I had forgotten one turn<br/>
to plink him for 2 with Test 6. Time was called on his turn, so he drained, and<br/>
I had one turn left. I made him lose 2 from Test 6 and then drained for 2, both<br/>
of which came from his hand, and recycled with Traffic Control. I had nothing<br/>
else to do, so we counted our cards. Graham had 15. I had 19.<br/>
<br/>
TW 9, +90<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Obi crushing a walker with the power of the force. Pulling out the win.<br/>
Lows: It was timed.<br/>
Ugly: I hate timed games.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, a timed game throws me out of my rhythm, throws me off focus, but, of<br/>
course, I did not want that to happen, here, so I just reminded myself that if I<br/>
won my next game I was in the final confrontation. Graham had had some<br/>
incredibly high differential going into our last game, so he was still the top<br/>
light side player in the final game. Accordingly, we played again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, my Agents of the Black Sun versus Graham Neal, Watch Your Step.<br/>
<br/>
An opening hand Emperor deployed to the Tatooine DB, and on my second turn, Guri<br/>
deployed to the Spaceport DB, allowing Xixor to move over and start the Damage<br/>
Parade. Graham played a Tatooine Celebration variant of WYS and started Squassin<br/>
to get his ships up to Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
This game is kind of hazy to me because it fell in-between the timed game and<br/>
the final confrontation. So, I gave it away. I won this game and got into the<br/>
final confrontation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Graham was trying to control space while I was controlling the ground<br/>
with the Emperor and Xixor with Guri. I do not remember what happened to Luke.<br/>
Either I manipulated him away, or captured him. Luke stayed off of the table, so<br/>
I reaped the full benefits of the 7-side of my objective. I did my direct<br/>
damage, recycled high destiny and peeked during each of my battle phases to see<br/>
what the top of my reserve held in store. At some point, Graham flipped and set<br/>
up shop at Tatooine. I had not yet found my retrieval killers, so I did not want<br/>
him to set up Celebration. Instead, I saved enough force until I could deploy<br/>
Zuckuss in MH, Bossk in HT, Fett with Gun and transit Guri up into space,<br/>
backing up Xixor with everything else under the Black Sun.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I continued to manipulate his force pile with Dangerous Time. Knowing<br/>
how much Harvests could ruin my fun, I kept manipulating the Moisture Farm to<br/>
the top of the force pile where Graham was certain to use it. At any rate,<br/>
Graham battled my two ships with Dash and some random co-pilot on the Outrider<br/>
and Captain Han, Chewie and an RFC in the Falcon. He drew 1 destiny, and I drew<br/>
3. I had to lose Fett with Gun to the attrition, and Graham lost two of his<br/>
characters. On my next turn, I played No Escape to get Fett back into my hand,<br/>
deployed him to Zuckuss, deployed 4Lom to Zuckuss and deployed IG-88 with gun to<br/>
Zuckuss. Graham had no barrier, so I battled and drew my 5 battle destiny to his<br/>
1. So much for the flip side of WYS. His space fleet went down in burning flames<br/>
to a total of 27 attrition. Shortly afterward, I slapped a Presence of the Force<br/>
on Tatooine, shuttled Guri down to rejoin Xixor and resumed the Damage Parade.<br/>
<br/>
Differential did not matter anymore, so I have no clue what it was. Suffice it<br/>
to say, I won and made the final confrontation.<br/>
<br/>
Josh Kohman, perched like a contortionist in his seat, defeated Garrett Larson<br/>
to go to 5 and 1, but he was 1 differential shy of second place, which went to<br/>
Mike Raveling.<br/>
<br/>
This set up a rematch of the Minnesota Grand Slam confrontation, and, like then,<br/>
I was tired. Very tired. Anthony Lawrence hit us up for interviews in the pause<br/>
while Dion did deck checks. Asked if I had any advice for Minnesota players, I<br/>
replied that they should not play Watch Your Step because I will win against it.<br/>
Then, I found out I was going to have to back up those words since Mike Raveling<br/>
was playing Watch Your Step in our first game. Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Final confrontation, game 1. My Vengeance against Raveling Euro-style WYS Beats.<br/>
<br/>
Shame on me. I had not read up on the German WYS deck. I saw it listed on<br/>
DeckTech and just kept thinking to myself, Oh, another WYS deck, how bloody<br/>
original. And then I clicked on something else each time. So, now I had to face<br/>
it, knowing very little apart from the fact that Mike wanted to initiate battles<br/>
because he was starting Draw Their Fire. I also knew I was in for a headache<br/>
with the Spaceport docking bay since Mike started Ounee Ta. How very meta.<br/>
<br/>
I started my usual IAO, Mob Points and Crush. I played a first turn Monnok to<br/>
see if Mike had the goods to back up Ounee Ta and Draw Their Fire. He did. So I<br/>
stayed put and drew a card, saving one force since I had Guri in my hand. On<br/>
Mikes turn, he deployed some stuff. I deployed Guri to the Spaceport docking bay<br/>
and moved Xixor over to join her.<br/>
<br/>
Early on, I start getting Mike Raveling Sweaty Palm disease and make a joke about that.<br/>
<br/>
Though, that makes me wonder. Is Guri really a her? Do droids have a gender? If<br/>
so, how do you tell?<br/>
<br/>
Again, with this game, the details are a little fuzzy now since I was tired after so many hours of card playing.<br/>
But I was able to get Emperor Palpatine and IG-88 to the Cantina while getting Xixor and Guri to the Death<br/>
Star DB. Mike played Han with Blaster, some scrub and Luke to battle the Emperor and IG-88. On his first<br/>
action, Luke targetted and missed the Emperor. I needed to flip my objective, so I targetted Luke and drew<br/>
a blind, fateful 5 to capture him. With Luke out of the battle, I forfeited the Emperor and deployed another<br/>
one on my turn. I ran IG-88 away from Han with Blaster since I did not want him to get shot with a Sorry<br/>
About the Mess. That battle, along with a Monnok lost that got two of his Dash Rendars, pretty much<br/>
turned the game irrevocably in my favor. Since Mike had the Artoo and C3P0 combo to allow all droids to<br/>
be battled, I spent the rest of the game trying to run IG-88 away from his characters while Mike kept chasing<br/>
him. We had a couple of battles in the Cantina with my Xixor and Guri against several of his scrubs, but he<br/>
never shot Guri, and when I was able to verify that something was missing from the deck Mike built, I<br/>
noticed that he only had 2 or 3 cards of 5 destiny in his reserve. So Xixor and Guri kept surviving the<br/>
battles. Zuckuss held space. Eventually, my drains and damage finished him off, and IG-88 retained<br/>
possession of his prized prisoner until we started picking up our cards. Full Win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
We shook hands after the game, and my hands, though sweaty, were not quite as clammy as Mikes. So,<br/>
Sweaty Palm Diseaset is something I can never take away from him.<br/>
<br/>
So, at this point, Zach Stenerson, who is my personal good luck charm, owing to the fact that I have won<br/>
every tournament which he attended, said, That is the best game I have ever watched. Except he used<br/>
contractions because you can do that in common English without creating strange typographical symbols. I<br/>
looked at him like that was no time to be sarcastic, but it turned out he was being sincere. Perhaps a bit<br/>
hyperbolic, but sincere. So, Zach, I am glad you were entertained.<br/>
<br/>
The next game would not be among the best Zach had ever watched.<br/>
<br/>
Mike and I agreed to take a brain-breather in-between games. And, now, I am reminded of one of the other<br/>
questions Tony Lawrence asked me. When asked what it was like to play against Mike in the final<br/>
confrontation, I told him it was like deja vu since we had played in the MN Grand Slam. Tony then asked if<br/>
that made it easier in any way. I said it was nice because Mike is an honest player and a nice guy. Being able<br/>
to agree on a brain-breather without any discussion was an easy example of that.<br/>
<br/>
Final confrontation, final game. My Save You It Can If You Remember What Your Cards Do versus Mike<br/>
Raveling, BHBM.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I will make this short because there were only about 5 or 6 events of note.<br/>
<br/>
1. Mike sets up early with Palpatine and Vader. I work on my tests. When Vader hits the table, I deploy Obi,<br/>
HotJedi, battle, chop Vader and stack 1.<br/>
<br/>
2. Mike works at setting up systems. So I draw for the SuperFalcon. Mike started Crush the Rebellion to<br/>
grab his Monnok and Evader combo. All game long he has been paying to drain then taking his next action<br/>
afterward. Suddenly, he asks me how many cards I have in my hand. I have 12. Zach Stenerson who sat<br/>
behind my shoulder while watching the game can attest to the fact that I was shuffling my cards, preparing<br/>
to lose my double of the Falcon. Mike Monnoks me. Ouch. He gets nothing but two Falcons. But that is<br/>
enough. Very bad. So, now, I have no space fleet and need to either deploy against his Emperor in order to<br/>
get off an On the Edge or draw for the Lower Corridor. This is, anyway, a bit distracting and discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
3. Meanwhile, I have been taking full advantage of the game text on Test 1 that allows me to exchange a<br/>
card from my hand for a jedi test in my lost pile in order to draw for other cards that might be more useful at<br/>
a given moment. However, I complete Test 3 at the end of one of my turns with, maybe, 8 or 9 cards in my<br/>
lost pile and say, Go.<br/>
<br/>
4. I realize about two seconds after Mike activates his first force that I have just lost the game. I curse and<br/>
hit my head in self-disgust. Test 4 is still in my lost pile, and there are many less-important cards in my hand<br/>
at this point. Despite the fact that everyone tells me my deck is an auto-loss against BHBM, especially when<br/>
played by an opponent as good as Raveling, I was losing only 1 or 2 force a turn, and, if you recall, if I am<br/>
not losing 3 or more force a turn, I will win. Unless I forget to exchange a card from my hand for a jedi test<br/>
in my lost pile. There goes Worlds.<br/>
<br/>
5. A few turns later as I am scrapping for every ounce of differential, Mike takes a look at the board after<br/>
one of his deploy phases and notices he has total control. He starts looking at his reserve deck and hand and<br/>
used pile. I ask him how many cards he has in his life force. He has 16 and 1 more in his hand. I plan to draw<br/>
on my next turn, but Mike manages to recycle a force.<br/>
<br/>
6. I play to cause just one force worth of damage. But without the Falcon and with as little force as I have, I<br/>
can not do it. Though on my last turn, I do manage to battle the Emperor and Leia and win the battle. He<br/>
loses Palpatine, and I play Advantage. But Mike has enough force to pay to drain me out with his space<br/>
drains, and I lose by 17.<br/>
<br/>
So, we split our games with equal differential. I have no idea what happens at this point, though, I figure if<br/>
we have to play a third game, I will play my AoBS and win. But Dion Erbes, our TD, says the ruling is that<br/>
the tie-breaker is that the tournament goes to the player who finished higher in the normal standings. That<br/>
was me, so I won by default. Not the best way, but given the mental slip I made in the last game, I guess I<br/>
will take it.<br/>
<br/>
Final confrontation--<br/>
Highs: Mike is a great opponent. I always have to think, and I am severely punished when I do not.<br/>
Lows: For three or four turns I tried to cause just one point of damage in the last game and could not do so.<br/>
Ugly: Um, the not remembering what my deck was meant to do part.<br/>
<br/>
So, I get first and qualify for Worlds Day Two, so maybe I will see you there.<br/>
Mike gets second.<br/>
Josh Kohman got third.<br/>
Justin Alfs got fourth, losing only to Mike and myself.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been a good day for Team Mirkwood if about half of the tournament had not been from<br/>
Mirkwood, thereby nullifying the point of any distinction.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers:<br/>
Mike and all of my opponents for good games.<br/>
Dion for running an excellent tournament.<br/>
Zach Stenerson for being my good luck charm.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers:<br/>
Not any really. Even Herb was polite.<br/>
