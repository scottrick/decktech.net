<blockquote><font class="bfont"> So we don't really play this game anymore, but anytime there's money given out, Greg has a pretty good shot to <br>
<br>
win it, so we play a few games like Sunday before the event. Lingrell is supposed to come down and join us, but <br>
<br>
his wife goes to the hospital on Thursday night or something, and won't be able to make it. So sometime friday <br>
<br>
afternoon me and Greg head down to Maryland (What the frimbazel are we doing in Maryland?) We find the store after <br>
<br>
like 10 minutes of searching. There's some people playing in the back, but we were told there would be poker,<br>
which is the reason we're here tonight. Elia says there's no house, so we're gonna play in our hotel room, <br>
<br>
which we haven't got yet. So we go to the Comofrt in and they say it's like $80 somehting for a room so we go <br>
<br>
to leave. The lady stops us and tells us to go to the Best Western and gives us a $5 off coupon, so we get a <br>
<br>
room for $60, sweet. We get myself, Greg, Elia, John Anderson, Jon and Chris Westergard, and random fat Magic <br>
<br>
guy to play a $30 game. Random Magic guy has 2 fat-ass ugly girls show up, so that was kind of frightening. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I lose at poker, and eventually Jon wins like $120. Everyone leaves and me and Greg decide we should <br>
<br>
play a game or 2. I have this ridiculous LS that starts the Rebel Landing Site, and plays Careful Planning (v) <br>
<br>
for Endor and Chief Chirpa's Hut. It plays cards I never thought I would see in a deck like Wuta, Chewbacca of <br>
<br>
Kashyyyk, Insertion Planning. Yeah. Somehow it kicks the exhaust out of Greg's Hunt Down so I decide to play it. I <br>
<br>
play one game with MKOS against the TRM, and Greg decides to add The Camp. Silly. Anyway, since I'm only gonna <br>
<br>
get a few hours of sleep, I decided to go then.  <br>
<br>
We get up in the morning and I flip a coin to decide my Dark Side. Heads was MKOS and tails was Senate (which I <br>
<br/>
had been playing with for the past month or so). It ennds up heads, so MKOS it is. We end up with 26 players, <br/>
<br/>
including Mike Pistone, Brian Hollingsworth, Reid Smith, John Anderson, Team Ohio (real original fellas), and <br/>
<br/>
Greg. Onto the suffering:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - Light Side vs Nate Meeker MKOS (Whipid Rep)<br/>
I start Strike Planning, Civil Disorder (v), and Sai'tor (v) to his Twi'lek (v) for Hutt Influence (v), Den of <br/>
<br/>
Thieves (v), Jabba's Influence (v), Power of the Hutt. He drops AC from hand, pulls Jabba the Hutt (v), Scum <br/>
<br/>
and Villany, Bib Fortuna (Ref 3) and Ephant Mon. I get 4 cards and still have a terrible hand. I play General <br/>
<br/>
Solo, General Crix, and Corporal Midge (only scout in deck was Cracken). On his turn he drops a Wiphid at a <br/>
<br/>
random site, Dengar with gun, Fett, Bounty Hunter, and random guy at my site and initiates. Shoots both Crix <br/>
<br/>
and Solo. I play Insertion Planning. he draws 3, 6 (which I cancel), and 5, giving him 9 total destiny. I clear <br/>
<br/>
the site and take 14 overflow. I draw. he gets out Galid to the AC and Lando (v) to the Landing Site. I drop <br/>
<br/>
Jedi Luke with Saber and Chewie of Kashyyk to my back Door (which I drew and deployed) and end my turn. He <br/>
<br/>
drains, plays Xizor and Dr. E combo to the Back Door, makes Luke Power 0 and initiates. I cut Xizor, but Den (<br/>
<br/>
v) keeps his forefit. I draw a 4, he draws a 1 (which becomes a 3). Since I forgot to play Insertion Planning <br/>
<br/>
from hand, I lose Chewie and he moves over. Now I have 15 force or so left in my deck. I activate 14 (all I <br/>
<br/>
can) and drop Home One to Endor, figuring I'll get free drains. On his turn he drains, drops Zuckuss In Mist <br/>
<br/>
Hunter with Brangus piloting, initiates, draws a 5, so I end up losing Home One. On my turn I drain and start <br/>
<br/>
to draw. He ends up draining me out a few turns later. FL by 29.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-29)<br/>
<br/>
Good - I get to be dark next round. I Out Of Commissioned Fett.<br/>
Bad - I made so many mistakes that game. I guess that's what I get for playing for real for the first time in 4 <br/>
<br/>
months and building my LS deck two nights ago.<br/>
Ugly - I cancelled a destiny, subtracted 3 from another and still had 9 attrition. ON TURN 2.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - Dark Side vs Michael Phelps AitC<br/>
I start Twi'lek (v) for No Bargain, Hutt Influence (v, into hand), Jabba's Influence (v) and Power of the Hutt <br/>
<br/>
to his Wokling (v), Bargaining table (v), and the musician card (the name escapes me at hte moment), as well as <br/>
<br/>
Yarna (v). I've played Mike before and don't really think he'd be playing the drop and drain version of AitC <br/>
<br/>
becuase I figure he'll be playing Jawas or something silly. On my first turn I get out the Sail Barge (v) with <br/>
<br/>
Passenger Deck, Jabba the Hutt (v), Scum, Ephant Mon, and maybe Bib- I don't really remember this game too <br/>
<br/>
much. What I know happens is I flip at some point. He's deployed like 5 sites (including Watto's Junkyard and <br/>
<br/>
has Credits Will Do Fine Out). He also has like 8 guys at the Audience Chamber. He drops some guys to 3 sites, <br/>
<br/>
and I respond with 3 battles and clear him. So now I have board control, and get to drain him for like 5 a <br/>
<br/>
turn. Whenever he dorps someone I go kill it. I eventually run out of some characters and he drops 3 more guys <br/>
<br/>
to sites and finally realizes that Ellors (v) lets him drain for +2 also. So he starts draining me for a few <br/>
<br/>
while I move over to block drains. I end up battling a lone alien, making him power 0, and winning the game. FW <br/>
<br/>
by 33.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+4)<br/>
<br/>
Good - Boba Fett (SE V) is the man.<br/>
Bad - That game went on way too long. He had Celebration going for much of the game and I couldn't find any <br/>
<br/>
space.<br/>
Ugly - Agents in the Court.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - Light Side vs Michael Pistone's Combat Readiness Scum<br/>
I start Launching the Assault over Civil (v) because I'm not going to be the one starting battles in this game. <br/>
<br/>
He starts All Wrapped Up (v), Power of the Hutt, Jabba's Influence (v), and No Bargain. First turn he gets out <br/>
<br/>
the Lower Passages, Jabba (v), Scum, Ephant Mon, Urururururururururur (v), and Hutt influence (v). I drop <br/>
<br/>
General Crix, General Solo, and Corporal Midge to the Landing Site. He drains for 1 and gets the Cruiser (v) to <br/>
<br/>
Tatooine, as well as Boelo and Bib to the Audience Chamber. I drain for 2 and draw, maybe Wuta came down, I <br/>
<br/>
don't know. He gets Galid to the AC, and sets up Lando (v) and some others at the Lower Passages. I drain for <br/>
<br/>
2, drop Tantive (v) and Bright Hope (v) with Corran Horn aboard. On his turn he drops Bossk in Hound's Tooth <br/>
<br/>
and random pilot and battles (I think, I'm terrible at remembering). I get the Home 1 next turn and he pretty <br/>
<br/>
much battles me each subsequent turn. Eventually I set up with Jedi Luke and Saber at my Back Door, the group <br/>
<br/>
at the Landing Site, and end up moving my space to Endor for a total of 7 damage. He gets Occupation going and <br/>
<br/>
is draining me for 2, 2, and 1, and hitting me with Occupation for 2, but he has more life than me. He also <br/>
<br/>
drops Arica to block my non-Luke drain, so yeah. I move back to block his space drain because I can cancel 2 <br/>
<br/>
destinies (Bright Hope (v) and R2, Brave Little Droid). I battle on my next turn, forgetting the broken-ness of <br/>
<br/>
the Cruiser (v) and he gets Bossk from reserve. I have to lose Obi-wan Kenobi (v) and Princess Leia (v) instead <br/>
<br/>
of being able to shuttle them to block a drain. He drains me out eventually. FL by 10.<br/>
<br/>
2 (-6)<br/>
<br/>
Good - I get to be dark next round.<br/>
Bad - I don't play Sorry About The Mess (but I don't think it would have mattered).<br/>
Ugly - What the frimbazel am I playing for LS? Why is the Cruiser (v) so good?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point I'm 1-2 and have pretty much lost all hope of making top 4, so I end up waiting for poker for <br/>
<br/>
most of the day, which will explain my behavior in the next few games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - Dark Side vs John Anderson playing kevin Elia's non-Profit<br/>
I start the usual against his 3 effects that I don't remember. It was probably Seeking (v), Wokling (v), and <br/>
<br/>
Colo. Anyway, here's where I show my skill at this game: I don't start aliens against Profit. My hand is <br/>
<br/>
terrible and I can't go get any sites. So for the first 2 turns I activate 5 and draw, get no sites or <br/>
<br/>
anything. One turn when I draw I manage to get twi'lek (v) and pull Jabba the Hutt (v) from my force pile, and <br/>
<br/>
also drop Lando (v) and Scum. He probptly battles them away and cancels Scum. Now I realize I can pull the <br/>
<br/>
Barge (v) which will get me the Passenger Deck, and that the Barge could have pulled Jabba and I could have set <br/>
<br/>
up a little bit, maybe. Anyway, he Out of Commisions Lando (v) which hurts him too, so it's all good. Brandon <br/>
<br/>
Schele calls Pistone (who is playing next to me) and we pass the phone around and all yell about something. I <br/>
<br/>
really don't do anything this game because I suck and he ends up winning by some obscene amount. FL by 28ish?<br/>
<br/>
2 (-33ish)<br/>
<br/>
Good - Twi'lek (v) for Jabba (v) and then Lando (v) with Influence (v) was pretty damn inventive.<br/>
Bad- I should have started Jabba (v) and Lando (v) with his objective.<br/>
Ugly - I didn't realize this until game 5. I LOST WITH DARK SIDE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - Dark Side vs _______________'s Profit<br/>
I start my stuff and he stars Colo, Seeking (v) and Insurrection &amp; Aim High. He asks me what aliens I want to <br/>
<br/>
start, so I start Jabba the Hutt (v) and Lando (v). It then dawns on me that 'Hey, I played against Profit last <br/>
<br/>
round and didn't start aliens.' Anderson is playing next to me and I yell at him, and he calls me an idiot. <br/>
<br/>
Fair enough. Anyway, I set up at the AC with Bib, Boelo, and Ephant Mon, and Urururururururur (v). He draws. I <br/>
<br/>
set up the Barge with an Abyssin and some other stuff and flip with Galid at the Passages and move him over. <br/>
<br/>
Stuff happens (heh, sorry, I really don't remember anything). What I do remember about this game is that I can <br/>
<br/>
never find my None Shall Passes, so EPP Qui-Gon and EPP Obi-Wan take turns doing hit and runs and going to the <br/>
<br/>
tank. He blocks two of my drains with Tamtel (v) and Boushh and I can only drain for one, while he drops Qui-<br/>
<br/>
Gon every other turn and battles with Draw Their Fire, which is all the damage he can cause me. Pistone is <br/>
<br/>
playing next to me and causes 101 overflow on Anderson. So I try to Elis for a super beatdown on Qui-Gon, but <br/>
<br/>
he started Insurrection (wtf?), so that sucked. Anyway, he ends up playing super slow, and I can never draw the <br/>
<br/>
cards I need (I don't want to draw too much because time is running out). He ends up timing me out with his 2 <br/>
<br/>
force swing. TW by 18.<br/>
<br/>
3 (-15ish)<br/>
<br/>
Good - I started aliens.<br/>
Bad - Timed win? That's the first timed game I've had in over 3 years.<br/>
Ugly - Slowest game ever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - Light Side vs Chris Westergard's Hunt Down<br/>
Holy exhaust, I played htis deck because it beats Hunt Down (well, in the one game I tested with it it did) and <br/>
<br/>
now I finally get to play against one. He starts racing (wtf?) with Your Eyes Can Decieve You (wtf?). I start <br/>
<br/>
Civil (v), Strike Planning, and Sai'tor (v). I don't really remember much about this game because it sucked <br/>
<br/>
hardcore. I have a ridiculously good opening hand and cancel Visage right away. He just draws on his first <br/>
<br/>
turn, and I drop Savrip and Boss Nass' Chambers and do the same. He deploys Emperor Palpatine and Janus to my <br/>
<br/>
landing site. So I drop Crix, and General Solo. He Lightnings Solo (I grab) and plays Young Fool to put him out <br/>
<br/>
of play. So I move Crix over to the Hut and draw. He drains for 3 and draws some more. I pull Wuta and the Back <br/>
<br/>
Door, and drop EPP Qui-Gon to get rid of the 2. On his turn he deploys Blizzard 4 and gets EPP Vader, and also <br/>
<br/>
drops EPP Maul somewhere and finishes the race. I get some scouts and stuff to battle Vader and get rid of him, <br/>
<br/>
but he sets up Emperor, Janus, Urururururururuur(v) and his Bantha at the Podrace Arena. I put Princess Leia (<br/>
<br/>
v) there to block the drain (thanks to Savrip) and he uses 2 Force Lightnings to get rid of her (who plays 3 <br/>
<br/>
Force Lightnings?). Anyway, since no Luke or Obi is to be found, I lose the game by like 40, since I did no <br/>
<br/>
damage. He asks me if Eyes was annoying and I say yes, and he was like 'Good, thats why I built the deck.' FL  <br/>
<br/>
by 30something<br/>
<br/>
3 (-40ish)<br/>
<br/>
Good - I grabbed the right card.<br/>
Bad - 3 Force Lightnings. No Luke or Obi (v). The mini-Maul deck drain.<br/>
Ugly - Your Eyes Can Decieve you and Podracing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I finish somewhere ridiculous like 22nd or something, I didn't even bother to look or get my prizes. <br/>
<br/>
Greg plays his 2 games and everyone leaves. Me, Greg, Pistone, Anderson, Elia, and Brian Hollingsworth are <br/>
<br/>
going to play poker back in Pistone's hotel room, but they all want to get something to eat. Tim Simon tells us <br/>
<br/>
about this restaurant, and says "I hope you can find it" and everyone leaves. I end up following Pistone and <br/>
<br/>
Elia for like 30 minutes and we never find it. Eventually we pull into a parking lot and start trying to call <br/>
<br/>
Tim, but we never get him. Kevin and Pistone randomly call people, then Pistone is like "I'll call brandon <br/>
<br/>
Schele." Well Schele ends up picking up Pistone is like "I'm on Route 24 in Edgewood, Maryland. Can you find me <br/>
<br/>
a restaurant near here?" And Schele actually looks it up. Who the frimbazel does that? Everyone else in the world <br/>
<br/>
would have been like "frimbazel off, find yourself one." and would've hung up. Well, he says there's some back the <br/>
<br/>
other direction, but we go across the parking lot and find some weird sandwich place. We leave our trash and <br/>
<br/>
leave $1 on the table and all leave while Anderson fills his soda back up. We all walk out and he comes out <br/>
<br/>
liek ten minutes later with the dollar. It was good stuff. We end up playing 2 games of poker for $20 each, and <br/>
<br/>
I win one and take 2nd in the other, so I end up even for the weekend. About midnight in the pouring rain me <br/>
<br/>
and Greg start back to NJ and get in like 2 hours later, but it's 3 AM, so that kinda sucks, but in all it was <br/>
<br/>
a good time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, this looks like it sucked to read. Sorry. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
