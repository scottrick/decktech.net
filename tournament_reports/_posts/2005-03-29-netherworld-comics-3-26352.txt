<br>
Well, tournament number three in a six month period has gone by, which means that Southern California action is absolutely hopping.relatively speaking.<br>
<br>
Pre-tournament stuff<br>
<br>
Theres a bit of doubt at first at whether or not this tournament is actually going to be happening, with Hari trying to get in contact with Netherworld ¾ the state away in Berkely. Fortunately, I have a better touch (or better luck) than him as far as logistics goes, and we are able to get it scheduled for the 26th at Netherworld Comics (Formerly Mile High) in Garden Grove. <br>
<br>
For prizes Hari decides to use a bunch of EPPs and foils from his collection. I also make some cool little awards for the tournament. Theres the Maneuver Check Award for extremely bad luck in a game of SWCCG, the Overwhelmed Award for biggest beatdown, the Impressive, Most Impressive Award for best use of tech, the Precision Targeting Award for hitting the most cards in a game, the Desperate Tactics Award for best come-from-behind victory, and lastly the Princess Leia Organa Award for having the largest number of female characters on the table at once. For those who care, we did decide to consider Lyn Me female for this contest, but unfortunately Jabbas hermaphroditic qualities werent able to net him a spot, since his personality as viewed in the movies is distinctly male..<br>
<br>
The next issue that comes up is whether or not we can get enough people to come. Hari can depend on Vinay and Jaymin coming, and I know that I can probably convince Geoff, Devin and Trevor to come up from San Diego, but that leaves only seven people. Fortunately my friend Paul, who got me into playing SWCCG in the first place but has an insanely busy life, is able to come after missing out on the five tournaments that Ive been to. Geoff and his crew also get Greg Miller to come up, and Chris Roy is able to find about the tournament, giving us a respectable 10 players.<br>
<br>
The morning of the tournament I leave my house about 9:30 to pick up Paul who lives about 20 minutes away in the next city. I pick him up, finding out that he still doesnt have decks built and return to my house about 10:30. We start rummaging through his cards finding the makings of an EBO and a AOBS for him, which are the two decks which he was comfortable with the last time he played, which was probably over a year ago. Being more comfortable with LS decks, I put together his EBO and end up just loaning a lot of my cards to him because we dont have much time left; its about 11:15 at this point, we havent eaten lunch, and I still need to add in 15 cards. We split a chicken burrito that was left over from Mexican take-out last night and leave about 11:35.<br>
<br>
Netherworld is a straight shot up Harbor Blvd from where I live, so it only takes about half an hour to get there. Having almost (but not quite) put together two decks in less than an hour, I decide that soothing music is in order, so we listen to Sixpence None The Richer on the way up. (Leigh Nash has a great voice, its ethereal). Anyways, we reach the comic store at about 5 past 12 and after taking maybe ten more minutes to finish throwing Pauls EBO and AOBS together, we start.<br>
<br>
My decks: my LS is TIGIH starting [v] The Signal, YISYW, Dont Do That Again, [v] Obi-Wans Apparition and Honor of the Jedi. I altered it quite a bit, ditching a lot of the anti-barrier stuff which never got used in the last two tournaments, and augmenting the space a bit, with Quad-laser tech for Spiral/Tantive IV, ugly with Blaster Prof. I also added in [v] Logistical Delay and Smoke Screen, which both ended up featuring rather prominently in the tournament. My DS is a fairly standard MKOS starting [v] Twilek Advisor with Gallid/Mosep drains and Elis beats.<br>
<br>
Game One: My MKOS vs Harikrishna Mehtas WYS<br>
<br>
This game is bad for me. The only experience I have had against WYS is when I had a playtest game against Hari before the last tournament I went to in January. I start Power of the Hutt and [v] Jabbas Influence, with Scum and Villainy and Hutt Influence in my hand. He starts [v] Cell 2187 (what the heck?), [v] Wokling and Squadron Assignments. First turn I pull [v] Sailbarge which pulls Passenger Deck. I also pull Audience Chamber and drop Scum and Villainy and [v] Jabba the Hutt from hand there. I use the copy of [v] Twilek Advisor in my hand to search my used pile for an alien and pull Ephant Mon from there and drop him for free. (This ends up being a key move on my part) His turn he pulls [v] R2-D2 with [v] Cell 2187, tosses out the DDTA shield and uses it to pull A Gift, deploys R2-D2 to Jabbas Palace, and then starts to move him over to the AC. At this point I remind him of Ephant Mons gametext (no spies deploy or move to his site) and Artoo stays put at JP. Unfotunately, he pulls Bo Shuda with his Wokling and drops it at the AC. He then deploys Melas from hand to the AC. So yeah, his deck was pretty much teched specifically against Scum. I knew I hated Scum for some reason or another. Or rather, I dislike the fact that Peter Nordstrom does well enough with Scum to warrant a player devoting around one tenth of his deck to beating it. :P Anyway, my turn. I deploy Mosep to the AC via [v] Jabbas Influence and then deploy EPP Maul to the AC, thinking that he cancels Bo Shuda. Hari points out that I would need to move all of my aliens away to cancel Bo Shuda, so not wanting move Ephant Mon and letting him pull off A Gift, I ask him if I can take back the deployment, which he allows. At that point I really dont have anything to do, so I just draw up. His next turn he drops LSJK to the Cantina with his saber. Dang. What happened to WYS using Luke in space? Anyway, my next turn I deploy my Maul to the Cantina and he promptly gets nailed with an It Can Wait, my new least favorite card. Grrrrr. I end up drawing up some again. His next turn he drains and drops the Kessel system. So next turn I throw out my Maul for free. I also deploy Myo from my hand and [v] Ktik Keedkak from my deck via [v] Jabbas Influence. I initiate battle, miss both swings against Luke, and draw a low destiny. He hits Myo and draws high. End result: I lose all my characters, Myo to used, and Hari loses four force from his hand. Luke stays. Not an excellent situation, to say the least. Next turn Hari drains at Cantina and reveals Mirax from hand, pulling Pulsar Skate with Squadron Assignments, and deploys them both to Kessel. End turn. Next turn I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to Kessel. It Can Wait. Ouch. Now I doubly hate that card. My turn ends. He drains for six and and deploys Dash/Outrider to Kessel. My turn I deploy Boelo to the Cantina via Power of the Hutt, Evazan combo (IIRC) from hand, and Myo via [v]Js I. I deploy an Abyssin to the Sail Barge. Bad Move. Really bad move. Really, really bad move. Really, really, really bad move. I cant emphasize enough how bad a move it was. Anyways, in case you didnt figure it out before, it was bad. Oh, by the way, it was bad. Anyhow, I deploy the Abyssin to the Sail Barge **cough**badmove**cough** and flip my objective. I battle Luke and the battle comes to some sort of resolution. I cant remember if I cleared the site or just caused him some force loss, but it really is a moot point. His turn he drops Han w/ Blaster and Angry Chewie to the Desert Heat and initiates a battle against my Abyssin, who was there due to the aforementioned bad move. Life Debt. 31 battle damage. Ghhhk? You guessed it, no Ghhhk. Me lose. Me lose big. Oh well. I made Hari work enough that I only lose 17 differential points.<br>
<br>
FL 0(-17)<br>
<br>
The bad: It Can Wait x2, <b>THE BAD MOVE</b>, anti-Scum tech in general<br>
The good: Ah, um, thwarting A Gift, I guess? Im not sure if there was anything else, but if you include in your review a alternate good event that you observed during the course of this game, Ill give you 1 brownie point.<br>
<br>
Round One Results:<br>
<br>
Geoff Bowman def Trevor Kurtz by 23<br>
Greg Miller def Paul Zaich by 19<br>
Vinay Shah def Devin Kurtz by 18<br>
Hari Mehta def Camden Yanaga by 17<br/>
Jaymin Vaghashia def Chris Roy by 12<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other notes: Paul probably could have won his game, but he got a bit confused with the [v] CP start for EBO. Somehow he didnt get the MPG or 4th marker onto the table at the start and lost the MPG in a hand of sabaac, of all things, early in the game. Additionally, Haris beatdown of yours truly wasnt the largest one this round. Jaymin pulled off one of 34 force on Chris during their game, setting a precedent for the receipt of the coveted Overwhelmed Award. Vinay gets Mirax and Princess Leia on the table, in running for the equally coveted Princess Leia Organa Award. After my game with Hari is over, I show him the copy of Episode III trailer that I have on my notebook. He is in awe afterwards. :)<br/>
<br/>
We end up waiting for Trevor and Geoff as we start round 2, because they decided that they were hungry (Who gets hungry during a SWCCG tournament, anyway? Oh, wait, I guess I do too. Never mind.) and headed over for 10 minute or so to KFC to buy cheap little 99 cent appetizer-size sandwiches that they had seen on TV. Anyway, they show up, and the round starts.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: My TIGIH vs Trevor Kurtzs [v] CR starting Mauls Landing Site, Jabbas Palace and Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
His deck his an odd one. I start the cards mentioned above in my description of my LS deck. He starts Colo Claw Fish, Crush The Rebellion and [v] Blaster Rack. Looks like mains and toys. I have an awesome hand, with both of my copies of Qui-Gon, my [v] Obi-Wan and one Weesa Gotta Grand Army, The Signal and [v] Civil Disorder included. First turn he pulls the AC, stacks a 7 on claw fish and draws. I drain with Luke at Chirpas Hut. He sends Lukes saber to the Used Pile with Weapon of an Ungrateful Son. Splendid. I pull Battle Plains with Weesa Gotta Grand Army and deploy it. I draw, notably pulling [v] Tanus Spijek. His turn he drops Maul at the Landing Site and pulls his double saber with [v]BR and deploys it. My turn I drop [v] Tanus to the landing site, which he has no response to. I then drop EPP Qui-Gon, initiate battle, and hit Maul thanks to YISYW (he hits Qui-Gon on the second swing) and swaps his 7 for a 1 for battle destiny. I draw about a 3 for my first battle destiny and Smoke Screen the other one for 7 and the site is cleared. He stacks on I Feel The Conflict. Next turn he just draws some cards. My turn I deploy [v] Bright Hope and [v] Tantive IV to the Tatooine system. I deploy Quad Lasers on Tantive IV. Too bad I never end up being able to use them; he eats this drain of three for the rest of the game. I also hit his now rather large hand with a Grimtaash lost and nail two copies each of Always Thinking With Your Stomach and Stormtrooper Garrision. His turn he draws some more. Next turn I drain for three. His next turn he deploys Presence of the Force on the Battle Plains and drops DVDLOTS with a Saber and Stormtrooper Garrison there. My turn I activate and deploy Leia, Rebel Princess, [v] Obi-Wan Kenobi and Owen and Beru Lars to the Battle Plains. I deploy a Stun Blaster on Leia. I also drop [v] Logistical Delay and use two force to cancel the Garrisons gametext. I initiate a battle, returning Tanus to hand with [v] Civil Disorder. I also had Draw Their Fire out at this point, IIRC, so we retrieve/lose to that. He successfully chokes Leia with a blind 5 and hits Owen &amp; Beru with Vaders Saber, swapping a 1 from Fish for the 5 that he drew. I lose the battle but take no battle damage, forfeiting Obi-Wan and placing him OOP, dropping I Cant Believe Hes Gone. I move Luke to the Landing Platform from Chirpas Hut. The rest of the game is essentially a drain fest. He draws cards and sends them back with Reactor Terminal, I get Lukes Saber out again with [v] The Signal, which he promptly sends back with Weapon of an Ungrateful Son. Later he deploys Tarkin by himself at the Battle Plainsa and I drop my other EPP Qui-Gon and [v] Yoda on him. Between that and my drains, the game is sealed. I win by 31.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+14)<br/>
<br/>
The bad: Not much here. Weapon of an Ungrateful Son ended up upping my differential in the end. Oh, I didnt get to show off my Quad Laser goodness.<br/>
The good: Defeating Maul and Vader. Using [v] Logistical Delay on his Garrison. Tech!<br/>
<br/>
Round Two Results:<br/>
<br/>
Jaymin def Chris by 35<br/>
Camden def Trevor by 31<br/>
Greg def Hari by 21<br/>
Devin def Paul by 18<br/>
Geoff def Vinay by 12<br/>
<br/>
Other notes: Jaymin, Geoff and Greg are undefeated. Vinay, Devin, Hari and I stand at 1-1 and Chris, Paul and Trevor stand at 0-2.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: My TIGIH vs Geoff Bowmans BHBM<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent matchup for me, but this game I am afflicted with the worst luck imaginable by a SWCCG player. He starts Mobilization Points, IAO Combo and First Strike. I start the usual. My hand is utterly deplorable. I have no locations, no location pullers, one character (the only one in my deck who CANT draw destiny by himself, Wedge RSL) and no Obi or Balanced Attack. He, on the other hand, I found out afterword, had the money hand with Carida (so my Dont Do That Again suspending his Mob Points was useless), Sidious, Mara Jade, Maul w/ Saber and BFBH, among other things. To quote one of the most tedious books I ever read in high school, The horror, the horror! Argh. Anyways, yeah, my hand is a refuse pile and his is suitable for framing. His turn he pulls Empy, pulls Emperors Power, pulls the DSII DB, pulls his grabber and Battle Order, and draws. My turn I move Luke to the Landing Platform and draw. IIRC I get Tanus Spijek in my draw. His turn he drops Sidious at the Landing Platform. Battle, I miss my swing and get average destiny. He draws two destiny (one extra with Emperors Power) and gets a 1 and a 6 to break Lukes immunity. Dang. Luke goes lost, I win the battle and he stacks, and he forgets to place Luke OOP with Sidious.  I dont win a battle for the rest of the game. I deploy Draw Their Fire and [v] Civil Disorder. For some reason I deploy LSJK back to the Landing Platform and battle Sidious. I have no idea why. I initiate battle, he loses two force, but ends up winning the battle. Luke is lost, Sidious stays, Luke goes OOP. I lose the battle and stack. Stupid, stupid, stupid. His turn he drains and moves Sidious to the DSII DB. The latter part of the game is a bit sketchy in my memory, but it is pretty much just him waiting for me to make moves. Eventually he sets up drains of one each at Carida and the Landing Platform. Sometime mid-game I finally get BNC onto the table, followed much later by the JCC. At one point I use Balanced Attack to try to bring out Obi, but hes one of the only seven cards of about 30-40 remaining in my deck that decided to be in my force pile. Argh! He verifies. Double argh! If I had been able to get him out at that moment I probably would have pulled out a win thanks to I Cant Believe Hes Gone, but the force just didnt want to be with me. The game proceeds with me just dropping destiny-drawing scrubs and battling him for the four-force swing via First Strike and DTF both being on the table. With [v] Civil Disorder also down it works pretty well, but without I Cant Believe Hes Gone I cant win any of the battles and I end the game with ten cards stacked on his Insignificant Rebellion. The game drags on, and I eventually lose by 15.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(-1)<br/>
<br/>
The bad: Oh, man, theres so much here. My HAND! That thing was stinkin horrible! Odds, for dictating that Obi-Wan would be in my tiny force pile. Sense, for canceling stuff. Sidious, for placing Luke OOP. Blind Destinies, for missing several lightsaber swings. Ouch. This is one game I REALLY want to forget.<br/>
The good: I did as well as I could given the circumstances. Lowering diffential. -15 aint all that bad.<br/>
<br/>
Round Three Results:<br/>
<br/>
Hari def Paul by 28<br/>
Greg def Jaymin by 24<br/>
Chris def Trevor by 23<br/>
Geoff def Camden by 15<br/>
Devin def Vinay by 10<br/>
<br/>
Other notes: Just in case you were wondering, I decided before the tournament started that I wouldnt take any of the awards that I was giving out, so unfortunately I wasnt a shoe-in for the not-so-coveted Manuever Check Award. At this point, only Greg and Geoff are undefeated.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: My MKOS vs Jaymin Vaghashias [v] CP Endor Mains starting Chirpas Hut, Landing Site and Endor.<br/>
<br/>
I start my usual. He starts [v] Rycar Ryjerd, Strike Planning and a third effect. It might have been [v] Civil Disorder. First turn I pull Barge and drop it at the Desert Heat, pulling the passenger deck as well. I also pull the AC, drop S&amp;V there and download [v] Jabba the Hutt there. I think I had [v] Twilek in hand like in my first game, so I use it to deploy [v] Gela Yeens from my Used Pile for free. I pull an Abyssin with Abyssin Ornament combo. His turn he just draws some cards. My turn I drain for one and pull the Lower Corridor. I also pull Ref III Bib Fortuna, download Gallid with [v] Jabbas Influence to the AC and deploy my Abyssin from hand.  move them both to the AC. His turn he deploys Qui-Gon with Saber and Owen &amp; Beru Lars to the AC and battles. I lose two force to double my aliens power. He hits Bib but takes overflow of about nine, with Geela reducing his characters forfeit and power by 2 each. Next turn I drain for two and download Mosep. His turn he pulls out the Battle Plan shield, drops Mantellian Savrip, and deploys the [v] Bright Hope at the Endor system. He randomly places Bib OOP with OOC and draws. My turn I drain for two off his reserve deck at the AC. I also deploy Chall Bekan to the Lower Corridor, download Boelo there, and deploy Myo there from hand. I play Grimtaash used on his rather large hand and send nine cards to his used pile. I also draw some cards, getting BiHT into hand. His turn I take his drain of one. He draws up. My turn I drain for four off his reserve deck and deploy BiHT, with Evazan Combo aboard. I cancel his Savrip with Masterful Move and initiate battle. My destiny is only 1 so he only has to forfeit Bright Hope. His turn he deploys HCF to Endor and battles. I draw high enough that I dont take any battle damage. I just forfeit BiHT and Evazan combo. My turn I drain for four and download Arica to the Rebel Landing site. His turn he drains for one at Endor, deploys Obi-Wan with Saber, TWHPS and Corran Horn to the Rebel Landing Site. He breaks Aricas cover. I believe that this turn he also deployed [v] Flash of Insight and used several deck-searching interrupts to randomly get a seven to the top of his deck. He used On The Edge targeting Obi-Wan and retrieved six force. On my turn I drain for four and download [v] Lando to the Rebel Landing Site.  I also deploy ECC 4-LOM there from hand and initiate battle, returning Evazan Combo to hand with [v] AAA, which I had on the table by this time. I cancel Obi-Wans gametext, and draw decent destiny. He draws fairly high, surpassing Aricas immunity, and I lose Arica and Lando to attrition. He loses Corran to attrition and battle damage and Obi-Wan remains. I draw Elis Helrot, among other things. Next turn he drains for two and moves Obi-Wan to Chief Chirpas Hut. He deploys [v] Bright Hope with EPP Luke aboard to Endor. My turn I drain for four off his reserve deck and download [v] Jabbas Space Cruiser with Evazan Combo aboard to Endor. I draw Mauls Sith Infiltrator. His turn he deploys EPP Qui-Gon and Owen &amp; Beru (again) to the Lower Corridor and initiates a battle. He hits Myo and has a fair amount of power. I draw a five and cancel his destiny, but its not enough warrant forfeiting Qui-Gon. Owen &amp; Beru are forfeited, Myo is forfeited and Boelo, Chall and Qui-Gon remain. He also initiates a battle at Endor. I react by deploying the Infiltrator from my hand with [v] Darth Vader from my reserve deck aboard for free. I reduce one of his two destinies by three and he tries to cancel mine, but I point out that HCF isnt a capital starship, so he cant cancel a destiny with his [v] Bright Hope. I lose Vader to attrition, he loses EPP Luke. My turn I drain for two and download [v] Ktik Keedkak and Ephant Mon to the Lower Corridor. I Elis Jabba and company over to the Lower Corridor and beat down Qui-Gon, who is power 4, forfeit 6 via [v] Geela Yeens and draws no battle destiny thanks to Boelo. I have power of 47 thanks to Jabba doubling my aliens power, and he takes 37 force of battle damage. Game. I win by 25.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+26)<br/>
<br/>
The bad: Nothing, really. Oh, having Bib go OOP randomly. That was annoying.<br/>
The good: Beatdown for 37 force. Ouch. Sorry Jaymin, it was nothing personal. :)<br/>

LS Decks Record: 11-9<br/>
DS Decks Record: 9-11<br/>
<br/>
So yes. Greg wins the tournament with decks that are several years old.<br/>
<br/>
We draft Haris foils and EPPs. I get Goo Nee Tay first round, Chief Chirpa second round, a B-wing Attack Squadron third round and IG-2000 last. Paul takes IG-88, Vengeance and Kiffex.<br/>
<br/>
Greg leaves with the coveted Impressive, Most Impressive Award for his use of tech cards like Trooper Sabaac.<br/>
<br/>
Devin takes the Desperate Tactics Award for coming from behind to beat my friend Paul.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor takes home the Precision Targeting Award for hitting at least three of my characters during round two.<br/>
<br/>
Paul receives the Maneuver Check Award for his trouble using the [v] Careful Planning Starting Interrupt. Sorry I wasnt able to explain the deck to you before you used it, Paul. :(<br/>
<br/>
Jaymin receives the Overwhelmed Award for his beatdown of Chris by 34 force in the first round. (Remember, I made the awards, so I wouldnt take any home)<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, but certainly not least, is the Princess Leia Organa Award for Vinay for having both [v] Princess Leia and Mirax on the table at the same time. (I think I may have tied this one as well)<br/>
<br/>
Im happy with my performance, if not with my luck, so Im not disappointed with finishing in the middle of the running. After being drained from so much mental exertion, Paul and I leave Netherworld, listening to some amped up music by Relient K and go to In-In-Out, the best take-out hamburger place in the whole world, for dinner. After taking him back to his house, I finally get back home and start thinking about new options for DS. No dice.<br/>
