<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <u>Team Tournament </u><br>
<br/><br>
I look through my deck box and I have no idea what to play as Barry Alperstein makes a late audible on me and wants to play dark all of a sudden. I know Brad Eier needed a partner for the event but he wanted to be the Alpha dawg and I wasnt too keen on that idea so I chose Barry instead. So I open it up and see the WSY Panic deck and think, oh that should be fun. I am missing two cards and throw in whatever I find, first: EPP Luke and Chewbacca, Protector V and the funny thing is that Mike Kessling was watching, so I was certain he knew what Panic did. Time will only tell. Barry decided to play Endor Operations abusing One Beautiful Thing with Shadow Pirates. It seemed interesting none the less. I usually dont take the side events too seriously unless there is cash up for grabs so I roll with it. I havent had anything to eat all day besides a bowl of cereal at home but no time to waste and I have to deal with it as pairing are quickly announced an hour late.<br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 1 vs. Mike Kesslings HD</b><br>
Mike is an old school player who has just returned to the game and missed a lot of goofy gimmick decks along the way. He had no idea what to expect from me and since my starting effects seemed completely random to him he didnt even know if I was playing a conventional WYS deck. He didnt have a good opening hand so he just drew. My first turn I decide to go down with a Ralltiir Freighter Captain (RFC) and a Medium Bulk Freighter to Kessel. He loses off the top and there goes Maul. It seems like he doesnt have many characters in hand so he might not even attack. There goes that plan and he plays No Escape to get Maul back. He comes down with stick and battles. I play Panic and get Corran, Panic and a RFC. I deploy Corran to cancel Visage and threaten another drain of 2 and the captain to the Tat DB. I then play another from hand and get 2 ships and obi with stick. I feel like Obi needs to help the RFC so I deploy him there. Mike forgets that Mauls saber swings twice and Obi misses. I draw enough to get through his immunity. (I think a 1 and a 4). Mike then plays the defensive shield Imperial Detainment and the WYS shield and looks at Fred and say WTF? Why didnt you tell me he was playing Panic! My next I drain for 7 and replenish my hand and save several for Detainment. He cant seem to find Vader and battles with P-59 at the Chamber but we are both immune. He doesnt move away and I come down with several smugglers including Chewbacca Protector V and cause a bunch of overflow. That pretty much seals the game. I win by 20 something. Fred is tired and just wants to test after seeing how Mike did so he just gives up and gives Barry the win by 20.<br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 2 vs. Jan Westergards TTO</b><br>
Jan is notorius for being drunk and has the same reputation as Thomas Whaley. This game is no exception and I barely could understand anything he was saying. After all of that this was the best game of the evening. Jan was my only win with the Panic deck at the SoCal event as he didnt really know what to expect from my deck. Today was different. He was ready and he even had the shield. Doh this isnt going to be pretty. Not to mention Nevar makes TTO a lot better. His turn he does his usual stuff. I deploy 2 captains at both of my sites and flip and save the rest. His turn he searches for stuff and draws. My turn I deploy a Medium Bulk Freighter (MBF) to his Endor so he can spend more force moving stuff around. His turn he deploys Visage V to the D* and shuttles up his dudes and moves in front of me. I deploy superstar Dash V (limits him to 1 BD) and another cheap smuggler aboard and move away. He comes down with Devastator V (that is a game winning card and VERY stooped btw) Now, I have to enforce with even more because running away isnt an option. He gets to battle and I play Panic as much as I can play. I go with more dudes to ground to drain more. I deploy Boushh to the Bunker and Doallyn V to the DB. I think I get another ship up to space. Speaking of ships I couldnt find many and was losing them to damage and drains. I am slowly whittling all of his guys down and keeping it extremely close. He then Force Pushes for Darth Vader V and that would be end of the whittling. Meanwhile, he has deployed 3-4 more Star Destroyers up in space and out powering me by a bunch to where I am going to start losing more smugglers and I wont be able to afford to keep space and win. We are fairly even in life force because TTO is keeping him in the game. I was missing 2 cards in this deck and I think one of them is Atrocity V oh well. All of his shenanigans like Protocol Failure and Controls are making this too close for comfort. I eventually hold off and 2 RFCs hold Tatooine sites the entire game without getting battled. I win by 8 or so and Barry wins his game pretty easily against Tom Holling(s)worths Mon Cals.<br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 3 vs. Ben Brummetts SYC</b><br>
I was a little worried when I saw Bens deck because I was thinking it was Herolds and I didnt have the shield in here but realized I was okay once I saw the objective. His turn he plays a bunch of sites and the superlaser and says go. I have a stellar hand and I want to put major pressure on him because his retrieval can get way out of control. Phylo comes down to his Docking Bay (DB), a RFC goes to the Cantina and a MBF goes to his Kiffex. I am threatening a drain of 7 on turn 2. He isnt aware of panic and its capabilities. He battles with Maul with stick without deploying a single shield. I play panic and draw 2 starships and another panic. I deploy the ships to Tatooine and the D* (we later realized this wasnt legal so I moved it to Tatooine. He tried to play 2 shields as a result and I told him I am still reacting to his initiation of the battle. He goes ok. I play another Panic and he says I cant. Barry assures him that I can. I draw more characters and deploy 1 to Kiffex and my db. I flip and play another Panic from lost. I dont remember who they were but I put them with Phylo. Everything at the DB dies and I drain for 6 next turn and draw some cards. He deploys a star destroyer, a guy and an Ion cannon to my lone MBF, battles, shoots and bunch of jazz but I Houjix. He doesnt have any force saved and I battle his ship and draw my two BDs and clear him from the board. He only has 2 cards in hand and he just gives up right there because he cant handle 2 turns of drains for 10 each. I win by 30 something. Barry beats Winston Plunkett by about 8 or so all because Winston took Padme instead of Home 1 with a Control &amp; Tunnel Vision.<br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 4 vs. Aaron Nelsons Endor Operations</b><br>
I knew this wasnt going to be an easy game because Aaron knew about Panic and Baron gets around Panic with only power 6 against the MBF so I was a little  scared. I was also afraid that Aaron had the shield and would blow me out in the middle of a battle and I wouldnt be able to Panic for free. Aaron did his usual junk and I played Lobot V to the DB and a RFC to the Cantina. I am fairly certain Aaron has never read Lobot V but he might be the single best character in the deck. He initiates with Admiral Thrawn against Lobot full well knowing that I cant panic (his power has to be more than twice of mine) but I use Lobots text to get Lando with Ax. I have Chewie v in my hand and I think I can get a substantial beat down in next turn so I exclude Thrawn. He moves to the Cantina. (I dont know why he didnt move to the Endor DB, maybe not enough force but I forgot as well). Next turn I deploy Chewie and another schmo and battle. I forgot I only got 1 BD so it didnt really work out well for me as I had hoped and I think he lost 1 overflow maybe not even 1. A drain of 2 would have been better. He is pretty low on cards and just has to draw on his turn. Lobot is so awesome I can keep him at the site alone and can get a RFC any time I please. I am scared of his AT-ST guns so I play slug combo when I get a chance. Turns out that was a good call. He finally battles with double my power in space against my lone MBF. I panic and he grabs. I spread to everywhere but couldnt find a spy to deploy to the bunker to suspend Endor Shield. I play another from my lost pile and I actually have so much stuff I have no idea where to put everything so I just stack up at the system to protect my Celebration. He is slowly deploying stuff and preventing a lot of my damage so I need to find characters to battle with and retrieve with Civil Disorder V. Barry loses to Kevin fairly quickly by 26! And now I have to play totally different. I can see the frustration on Aarons face even though he and Kevin were saying how horrible Panic is before the tournament. Aaron is only doing a damage or 2 and he battles me at one point in time and an intriguing rules question comes up about having two panics stacked on the grabber and something else stacked on A Useless Gesture V and how much force it costs to play. It was ruled in my favor so he didnt get a beat in although I had a Houjix combo in Lost pile but that would have given him board control and I wouldnt be able to win by 27. He was down to about 10 in life force and there was nothing he could really do anymore. I drew 1 too many and didnt save any Force for my Wokling and he drew up and I only had 25. Oh well, I need to be more careful next time. I had Thrown Back V on the table and could have dropped 6 or more cards down with that throughout the game. We told each other before the game that what ever happens here happens for the entire event and it was already 12:30 and no one wanted to play a final so they win the match and take home the mugs and are the team tournament winners!<br>
<br/><br>
So that quadruples the number of wins I got at the SoCal event with WYS Panic, heh. I forget my bag in the playing area and Aaron then tells Scott to throw the Panic deck in the trash. Haha. I have to admit it is rather annoying to play against.<br>
<br/><br>
Since it is so late Anderson, Herold and I just go to the room to get our decks and lists ready for tomorrow. I choose HBV sandspeeders that we have been frantically working on. First it was just a silly idea and then Herold and Anderson loved it so much they switched to it as well but they prefer the efficiency of Rebel Gunrunner. I could never make up my mind to which was better so went with the more reliable approach with Inconsequential Losses V. They also used a totally different space package than me. I played HCF x2, Home 1 and Spiral and was debating on GLiG1 or not and they played with the very risky Han, CS, Chewie V and Falcon V with 4 pullers. I think about putting in Scrambled Transmission V into my deck but I dont think any of my opponents will be playing Senate and then come to the rough decision of whether or not keeping the Incom Engineer in. He is sitting to the side and I do not put him in a sleeve. My Court deck is a replica of Throdos and I just keep saying I cant believe I am playing Court and everyone keeps saying what does that deck even do? I say I dont know but beating people down is fun and it can pull its space package! I can see Thomas Whaley grinning all the way from Texas. I think he has played that deck more than everyone else combined. I put in an extra Vibro-Ax because that card is the nuts. Go to bed around 4 after we waited for a pizza for 2 hours.<br>
<br/><br>
I wake up somewhat refreshed but still tired. The incom engineer was yelling at me all night long. Hey! Youre an engineer, Im an engineer help a brotha out and give me a chance. I felt sorry for him and crossed out an extra speeder on my list and the engineer went in to make me proud, albeit, with only a starting salary. You just dont know about slackers these days. He was happy and so was I Look! I am already doing more than our president has done to help out the hard working people!<br>
<br/><br>
<u>2011 Match Play Championship</u><br>
<br/><br>
<b>MATCH 1 - MICHAEL RICHARDS (4) VS MATT GOUNTIS (13)</b><br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 1 vs. Matt Gountis Hunt Down V Build aVader</b><br>
Matt is Justin Montgomerys protégé and his deck lists from past events were extremely solid so I knew not to take these first games lightly. I actually put Matt and my next potential player on HDV and my third round opponent on Watto so I put 2 Commander Wedges V in my deck. I asked Matt what he put me on and he didnt have a clue for LS but he thought I would be playing Destroyer Droids for DS. <br>
<br/><br>
I have only played two games with my deck so I was just hoping I wouldnt make any stupid mistakes and cost me the game. Matts deck list was running 2 Senses and zero starships so I had to be careful with my reacts and go straight to space and set up celebration asap. I spent the first turn deploying sites and just drawing and saving. He deploys the 3/2 site so now I am able to deploy everything I want next turn. I deploy HCF and several speeders with guns. He deploys Grievous to his 3/2 site and Vader in front of my speeder. He knows what they are capable of and does not battle. I drain and retrieve a bunch every turn and usually only draw a few cards. I deploy Wedge and flip him back and just spread with speeders. There is literally nothing he can do against my deck. He tries his absolute best but retrieving 5-6 every turn with Celebration and Incom Corporation combo every turn is brutal. FW by 33.<br>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 2 vs. Matt Gountis WYS</b><br>
I heard that Court is an auto win vs. WYS but I have no idea as I have only played Court in 1 tournament ever and that was at a local with 3 other players several weeks prior to the MPC. I honestly had no idea what to do or how it would go.  However, poor Matt gets another horrible matchup. He has to play super aggressive if he is going to win by a bunch. He goes straight to the Cantina since he knows I can pull my space package from reserve. I have an Elis in hand so I am just getting ready to setup the beats. I deploy a bunch of aliens and pull the rest of my activation and search for Scum and Villainy. He goes to Kessel with Luke/ship and Dash/ship. With those ships out I deploy 2 of mine to Tatooine and Elis over and proceed to beat. He has a Houjix and that was that. He draws a bunch and gets ready to go to the ground again. I just so happen to have another Elis in my hand and beat again, this time he didnt save enough force for A Useless Gesture V and I get about 10 overflow in. He then concedes. I encourage Matt not to be disappointed and stick with it and that is his doing great and he will be a great player soon. I told him that the matchups were horrible and I said that no one would have been able to win those games. <br>
<br/><br>
<b>MATCH 2 - MICHAEL RICHARDS (4) VS CHRIS KELLY (12)</b><br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 1 vs. Chris Kellys Imperial Occupation V</b><br/>
In all honestly I was expecting Tacobill so I am super worried about these games as he got the upset. Chris plops down the walkers objective and now I am going to have to deal with Decree and making this a difficult game. I cant really do anything to stop him from blowing the generators so my game plan is just to stick to Tatooine and retrieve with Celebration all game. I draw a bunch and fetch Atrocity V and get ready for him to blow. He tries on turn 2 but draws a zero so Veers misses. He then deploys Vader and moves him over and that should be automatic now with Tempest 1. I deploy several speeders and save a bunch to play my Home 1. He blows up the generators and I just decide to lose 5 of the top. Nothing. Nothing. Celebration. Nothing. Celebration! Gah I have to Wokling it back or I lose this game. My next turn, I finally get to do some damage and drain for several. I got to Wokling my for Celebration but then remembered that Wokling is placed out of play and I cant pull it anymore! I now have to activate it next turn, draw for it and then deploy it and finally retrieve during my control phase. This game is getting entirely too close for a single mistake. He gets me down to about 10 and he still has about 30 life force. I deploy Wokling and lose my entire hand except Snowspeeder Garrison and Dash in Rogue 10 my next turn and expect the worst from him on Tatooine and pray he doesnt have Masterful Move combo. Luckily he doesnt have an answer and just spreads on Hoth. I pay to retrieve 6 force, which just happens to be the amount of damage he is doing to me. He is starting to get worried as now he knows that Celebration will win me this game unless he can do something. He plays Command early and I grab. He deploys another ship to Hoth. My turn is the same from here out. Drain and retrieve, say go. He tries to play Walker Garrison for the GG but I have a T-47 Battle Formation I have been holding since turn 1. He deploys an admiral on the ship and moves in front of my Home 1. I am worried about a Lateral Damage or the Command clearing me out. I have a Spiral which I have also been holding onto for an extremely long time just in case. I finally get enough to go down with Dash and Garrison with guns and block some stuff. It is enough to deter him from battling. He is getting low on life himself and now he cant battle at both locations and the cost of 2 for the command is getting to him. He does happen to play Limited Resources which annoys me but it doesnt really do anything as I have stuck with my same game plan the entire game. Drain and retrieve. He eventually doesnt have anything for me and I finish him for a win by 14. <br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 2 vs. Chris Kellys Profit</b><br/>
I put TacoBill on Profit so I was semi-ready for this matchup as I have heard that Court should beat it most of the time. I get super lucky in my opening draw and get the silly droid that converts my site back. I start Snoova and Ponda Baba V. Luke cant do anything there and the risk of someone getting captured immediately is too much. I deploy Ephant Mon and get activation and say go. He just draws and has trouble finding his twixes. I deploy more stuff including scum and get the space cruiser up in space for 3 and start doing some decent damage. He deploys a lone Obi Wan to the Jabbas Palace and I have an Elis in my hand. I deploy some more stuff and move everything over. He doesnt have a Houjix, as most Profits dont, so Obi and 20 has to go. He concedes.  I think Chris got a little hasty with the Obi play and I told him that his game plan should be to stack up with characters and try to get a Nabrun through to flip with Leia, Rebel Princess.<br/>
<br/><br>
<b>MATCH 3- AARON NELSON (1) VS MICHAEL RICHARDS (4)</b><br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 1 vs. Aaron Nelsons TRM</b><br/>
I was talking to Mike Kessling a little bit before this game to get a game plan against TRM and he helped me a little. Even with the advice I knew it wasnt going to be easy and Aaron sure wasnt going to make any mistakes and give the game away. My Elis are worthless this game since he started Insurrection combo. He doesnt have any twixes in hand but he has a rebel leadership to get one. Brad Eier  that card is way too good. He pulls a DB and it is on me. I start Chus card to get me extra forces. Pull my DB, Nal Hutta but I activated the Sail Barge. That is a bummer. I draw because I dont have enough force to do anything this turn. We both forget my objective. His turn he gets more activation out and plays Threepio and Jedi Luke to the Chamber. I grab protocol Failure and play it and he lets me go and get Operational As Planned V and play then I play failure again. Lastly, I grab Look Sir Droids so he only gets Threepio once more this game and hopefully that will be enough to deter him while I get something going. Jedi Luke is a pain because of his immunity. I finally deploy some dudes to the sail barge but they arent cheap because I cant play scum or Aaron will just cancel it immediately with his text from the chamber. I have to go to space quick before he gets too setup so I come down with Zuckuss to guard against the HCF and Bossk in ship to my Nal Hutta. I have to eat a drain of 3 for a turn and he draws some stuff and saves a bunch. I get to a third battleground and get out Resistance and try to come up with a game plan to efficiently get to the Audience Chamber so I try to Elis during my move phase and forgot that I cant go to interior sites. What a bum deal so I pay for some to move or I will be out of force quickly. I verified his deck early so I know he has Senses in there but he basically has an answer for whatever I try to do. He plays Mess combo and I play Cease Fire but he has Hear Me Baby V. I draw to about 16 and Aaron plays Grimtassh used on me and I lose my Ghhhk and two droids. I have a lone Aurra Sing somewhere but he has a sense for the Stunning Leader and she gets overflowed for 5 or so. At this point I am just trying to get it down below 20 as I cant handle Master Qui-Gon either. Home 1 and Ackbar V comes down on Boba in ship and he goes to the lost pile with a couple of overflow. Leia, Rebel Princess is giving me a massive headache moving around constantly blanking all my aliens and I cant seem to find any droids. Any little drain I do get in Leia puts right back. Somehow I have more ability on the table than he does and he gets to play Rebel Reinforcements V and retrieves 4 more other cards and gets Tantive V back into hand and battles my ships with Lando V. I lose my space presence and Leia, RP is blanking me on the ground. I am eventually out of cards and lose by what seems to be an insurmountable amount of differential to overcome. FL by 26! I take a small break and try to recoup what dignity I have left.   <br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 2 vs. Aaron Nelsons Watto</b><br/>
So after that demoralizing defeat I think I have a slim shot at this. I know my speeder deck is bad news bears for Aaron but I really dont have a clue on how bad it is. I have to take some chances if I am going to pull this out. I know he is going to play Watto and a schmo down first turn so I take the risk and lose 2 of the top. Nothing is really detrimental except if it is double celebration. Luckily it wasnt anything important. I love this HBV deck at the moment. It basically gives the finger to all of the popular strategies including activating for Endor. Aaron doesnt even bother pulling it. I come down with 2 sandspeeders, guns and Wedge. I shoot and hit which is automatic against his heroic guy and kill watto with attrition and I forfeit the speeder. Aarons next turn consists of spending all of his force to deploy Blizzard 1 and General Veers. I am pretty worried about this because that will be hard to clear until I can track some destinies around. I attempt to shoot and BAM! I drew 1 of the 5 sixes in my deck for a hit! On top of the tremendous luck he draws a 1 and a 2 for battle destiny and I simply lose the gun for 3. I pretty much exhausted my hand last turn but he has as well so I just draw a bunch and look for ships and more vehicles. To my dismay I didnt get anything to back up Wedge besides Rebel Scout Luke so I have to spend a lot of force for that. He deploys Victory and Ozzel to my Tatooine. My turn I activate a ton to play Ackbar V to the ground and find Home 1 in my reserve. Play it and shuttle Ackbar up and say go. He doesnt have an answer for Wedge/Luke or Home 1 and has to move away and draw some stuff. I am getting extremely close to the 26 mark and have to be sure to never get below 26 because I think I would lose the tie from lost piles.  I then play celebration and a lot of speeders everywhere. After his damage he cant draw up yet or battle anywhere to kill himself so I draw a couple more to get about down to 24 as I know I will be able to retrieve 3-4 next turn. Then it basically goes down hill from there. He battles with dudes where he can and makes me lose a couple to Firepower V but it is a futile effort. By the time he can draw up I have been retrieving massive amounts and doing significant damage. I get him down to around 10 and I am getting worried that time will be called and he will take the match. One of my turns was literally drain and retrieve and say go without any thinking what so ever. He then informs me he wont let it go to time and I drain him out next turn for the win by 33 and taking the match. <br/>
<br/><br>
So I end the weekend going 2-1 against SoCal, specifically against Aaron and giving me a winning record against him at 4-3. <br/>
<br/><br>
<b>MATCH 4  MATT SOKOL (2) VS MICHAEL RICHARDS (4) </b><br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 1 vs. Matt Sokols Endor Operations</b><br/>
I didnt know what to expect from Matt but I had him pegged on Endor Operations and sure enough that is what he has for me. John and Brian playtested this game a lot online and the HBV did not have good results. Arnet and their big space package was too much to handle. Everyone was watching the game before so I knew that my deck was out of the bag and Matt had plenty of time to seek advice. Sure enough first turn he goes down with Black 2 and guy for a big 3 force and Ozzel to the Bunker for the first turn flip and now threatening a drain of 4 second turn. Yikes! Good thing I am not playing Brians and Johns versions or I would be dead already. I have to do something because that drain of 4 will add up too quickly for me. I just so happen to have three speeders in my opening hand and some guns. I deploy all three and get Ultimatum out. He drains and deploys backup to Tatooine. I play Noooooo! V several times and get both of my falcons. Here is where the inexperience of playing against this comes from. Should I deploy HCF to Fondor? Should I reinforce in fear of Arnet, pay 9 to drain and get it as close as possible? So I go the conservative route and reinforce a little matter of fact very little and search for Home 1 to go to space. Wrong idea he comes down with Arnet and other stuff on a lone speeder with my Engineer taking it easy n tryin to earn a dolla. After the smoke clears I lose about 7 overflow and he has cannons on his AT-ST as well. I get a T-47 Battle Formation in hand and pay nine to drain for 6 and get his diff down since Endor Ops can put a lot of cards on the table with all of the matching stuff and has minimal retrieval. His drains arent horrible, at least, not yet. He deploys Palpatine to the Endor DB and moves over Ozzel and draws a healthy amount. I finally drop HCF to Fondor and I have to manage my forces correctly. He comes down with Black Leader and something else and checks his destinies which equal 9. That gets past my Spiral and Falcon. I do the math and have to waste the Sprial anyways. Next turn I deploy my 2nd HCF to Endor. He doesnt have any answer to clear them but his drains are 7 now and I cant withstand much longer. I move a couple of speeders in front of Arnet forgetting that the guns can make vehicles go lost as well since I thought it was just characters. Luckily I had a mechanical failure but he still hits me pretty good for 3 overflow. I move a bunch around and donk around to try to get a couple of more damage in but he strategically moves and saves himself. FL by 18. Wow, I cant believe I played that game so horribly wrong. I have an uphill battle my next game if I want a chance to advance to the final 4 and making my second Day 2 ever at a major event outside of Texas. <br/>
<br/><br>
<b>Game 2 vs. Matt Sokols Profit</b><br/>
Up to this point I didnt have a clue what Matt was playing for LS either. I see Profit and feel pretty positive. Winning by 19 isnt the most difficult task in the world and I try to stay focus and hunker down. I luckily get the silly R2-A5V droid in my hand. My turn consists of slowing him down. I play the droid, convert, get a DB and pull Nal Hutta but I dont have enough force to get my passenger deck. He plays a farm, JCC and draws. I deploy a smuggler or Jabba, I cant remember, but I am fairly certain scum wasnt in my reserve deck. I pull the barge, get my passenger deck and deploy another DB. I just keep deploying guys to the Audience Chamber and get a ship up to space to start draining. I forgot to ping him for 1 with my objective which is super costly. His hand is really huge and I am somewhat afraid of the battle that could incur so I try to find my Cease Fires and what not. I know he has Dont Forget the Droids so I have to be prepared for that as well but I cannot draw too many and I cant seem to find my Cold Feet v. He just deploys all of his characters at Jabbas Palace: Chewie, Luke, SITF with toys, Leia Rebel Princess and Obi Wan. I cant get past all of that stuff and I know he has Senses and Nabruns. I used a lot of shields already but he put back a 6 on top of the deck with Leia so I know he needs two Senses to do anything. I do find some more droids unlike against Aaron so that definitely helps my cause. I still stick to my game plan of trading damage with him but he deploys Padme shortly after and now I am going to lose the damage race so I have to move and try to battle him. I put a ton of guys on the table but I need a ton of guys to get through all of his junk and have enough to survive not to get countered beat all while trying to stay above 17. I think I can win the match on lost piles if it goes to a tie. Plus I have a couple used interrupts that I can use to sneak in a win as well. So the fun begins. I get ready and try to Elis to his dudes. He senses and misses with the 6 and I grab and he senses again and grabs my Elis. My reasoning for grabbing sense instead of Nabrun in the future is that I am running 2 Nabrun cancellers and two pullers for it while Sense can wreck me all game. Oh well for that plan. I move all of my guys in front of him besides R2-A5 and some other random ability &gt; 2 guy. His turn he saves a quite a bunch and is worried about Oota Goota and declares he is Nabruning Obi over and I play Ghhhk combo. I know they play 2 but wasnt expecting another so early. He then says everyone to the audience chamber. I act pretty defeated. He battles and I play Stunning Leader and I know it is safe because he doesnt have 3 Force for another Sense. Now I can drain for a decent amount this turn.  I know he doesnt run many more characters that is already out so I deploy Jodo Kast V at his Farm and start hitting him there. He is getting really low on force and finally ran out of Leia text. He runs away to Jabbas Palace after I moved all of my guys to the Audience Chamber. He then realizes that running is kind of silly so he stays there and taunts me to do something all while Padme hits me for 2 every single turn. If he didnt have Padme out he would have done maybe 4 damage to me the entire game. I draw a couple to get my ghhhk back. I battle and retrieve a much needed 2 Force from Scum. He of course plays Dont Forget the Droids, some destiny adders and other junk. After cancelling the text of Grotto V he clashes Jabba and all of a sudden I really cant do anything this battle because I cant use Ephant Mons amazing game text. I lose a couple guys to attrition around 10 worth, I believe, and I HAVE to leave 4-Lom with gun or I lose the game because of stupid Leia. He loses nothing. Well that didnt turn out well for me but I still have plenty of hitting power including snoova with Ax. His turn he attempts to play Sorry about the mess but I Cease Fire. He decides it isnt wise to battle and stays put. I desperately need JQuille V and I win this game but he eludes me. We are getting many time warnings and I feel like my chances are slipping even though I have around 22 life force. He tries to play another Sorry about the Mess combo but I have another Cease Fire for him. About this time Matt comes down on the Jodo V who has been reeking havoc by force draining. He plops down a lone Corran and since Jodo forfeits for 9 he doesnt do anything and he moves him over to the rest of his crew. At this time Matt has 1 card in hand and 6 lifeforce. I leave the heroic droid and Ponda Baba alone in the Audience Chamber and move my squad to him. I said I have to do something or I lose anyways. I battle with a lone P-59 on his crew and shoot the hell out of Padme and retrieve with Scum and play ghhhk on my own battle but save myself an equal amount of damage. I said if you have Nabrun GG. He shows me Seeking V and for a minute I am relieved but then remembered Padme is in the Lost pile. He searches and sees Nabrun for a destiny of 4. He pays 4 of his 5 remaining force and battles Ponda Baba and the droid. I get no destiny and he clears me and flips and now has 5 more Force and does more damage. If I shuffled my characters correctly I could have left someone who drew BD there but I didnt and it cost me. Time is called and I have 22 and draw 4 ghhhk combo, random character, JQuille V and Elis. That is the game right there and we dont play anymore. I am fairly certain I could win the match on the next turn because of Elis, scum and most importantly JQuille. So if I didnt forget that 1 ping damage he wouldnt have been able to deploy Padme and battle that turn. Also, if I moved anyone over besides stupid Ponda Baba V I win the match. A super great game and the most thought intensive one for the entire weekend. <br/>
