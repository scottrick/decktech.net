Hello All!<br>
<br>
   Well the day started off with a phone call from my friend Andres. He was supposed to direct the tournament today, but was feeling sick. Well since Andres covered for me on the previous tournament, it was my turn to return the favor. I guess Tucson will have to wait for my 'Playing Sabacc for a Profit' deck.<br>
<br>
   So I show up to the site about an hour early. The tournament today was going to be the first Star Wars tournament we've held at this store. A friend of Andres's and mine owns the small shop, and he wants to start hold tournaments here. It was a nice store with comfortable room for all of us, and it wasn't hot like the other site we usually play.  The store is Kards 4 You by the way.<br>
<br>
   I was able to get in 1 game before the tournament, but then everyone started filing in. I was glad to see a few people from Phoenix come down to play in the tournament. Thanks again Mike, Brian and Scott! So we've got 15 players and we're off! Actually I was able to give someone my decks and talked him into playing so we'd have 16 players and no bye. Thanks Justin!<br>
<br>
GAME 1 Brian Garrison's HDADTJ vs. Patrick Gimber's Dagobah Clouds<br>
<br>
   It looks like both of these players had decided to do with a strategy that Tucson hasn't seen for quite a while. (From what I've heard though, Phoenix has been bitten by the Number's bug.) Well it didn't take either player long to figure out the other's strategy and stop it.  Brian deployed Come Here You Big Coward! and Patrick activated all of his Force to stop the inserts.<br>
<br>
   I'm not sure how Brian was losing Force other then from his own Visage. But it came down to a Visage race. Patrick however was playing with We're Doomed and was able to avoid Visage and Brian's drain of 1 each turn. So for every go around, Brian was losing to his own Visage twice and Patrick only once.  The result was a Full Win for Patrick by 5.<br>
<br>
   This was a great game in my opinion because both players quickly adapted to their opponent's strategy and was able to shut it down. Extra kudos go to Patrick in the end for using Brian's Visage against him. You'll see both of these guys in the top scores of the tournament later.<br>
<br>
GAME 2 Robert Dayton's Endor Operations vs. Josh Latneau's Hidden Base/Falcon<br>
<br>
   This was going to be a very interesting game because of the two very different strategies. Robert darns you to come to Endor and stop his drains, while Josh dares you to come into Space. Robert is a relatively new player to the Tucson tournament scene, but in the few times I've played him I've quickly come to respect his playing ability. Josh on the other hand I play all the time. I know his playing style and no matter what I do he's always one step ahead of me. One of these days I'll get him.<br>
<br>
  Well, both were able to flip their Objectives without much resistance. I think Josh actually made Robert flip Endor Operations back once. But once it was on the 7-side, Hidden Base couldn't stop those ground drains. There was also 1 big battle at Coruscant that took out the Falcon. (Reread Imperial Outpost, 'Opponent may not draw more than one battle destiny.') But Hidden Base is able to hit you with big drains too. So it was neck and neck to the end. Robert pulled off the win by 1 Force.<br/>
<br/>
   Obviously the closest game in the tournament and a very entertaining one at that.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3 Scott Vales's HDADTJ with Numbers vs. Michael Girard's  'Brenston's Beats'<br/>
<br/>
   This was the top match of the round. Both of these guys had separated from the rest of the pack with differentials of 68 and 65 after just two games. Compared to the closest scores of 4(+22), 3(+13) and 2(+25). <br/>
<br/>
   If there was one action that Michael wishes he could have taken back, it would be losing the Cantina to Visage early on in the game. U-3PO stopped his drain at Mos Eisley and he had taken Sorry About The Mess out for his deck for another card. Fortunately for him, the card he chose in it's place was Don't Forget The Droids. He was also able to get a Bothan Spy to cancel Visage early on, but losing the Cantina really hurt. So Mike was able to stop the numbers, and we was also able to beat up on Vader whenever he was deployed but after that we were at a stalemate. In fact it was so close that at 20 minutes left in the round, it was a dead draw. Each player had 16 Force remaining in their Force Piles.<br/>
<br/>
   Scott had offered a True Tie, but Mike wouldn't have it. He looked over the cards in his hand, hoping to find something to put back in his Force Piles. Finally it hit him. Deployed GLinG1 to Rendezvous Point and moved it over to Dagobah. Scott wasn't sure what Mike was planning so he passed on his turn and let Mike continue. Mike then moved GLinG1 to the Dagobah swamp were it quickly sunk to the Used Pile. Brilliant move by Mike in my opinion. Now he leads by 1 Force. This forces to Scott to start playing cards again. He deployed Vader and tried to Force Drain at the Holotheater. Before he could play Projective Telepathy Mike Surprised Assaulted Vader and the 3 Droids for 21.  After Scott lost the Force, it was sealed. Mike pulled off the modified win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
   I'm sorry, but because I was busy preparing prize support and everything, I didn't get a chance to watch a game 4 match. <br/>

One last, interesting fact. The eight winners of game 2 all finished in the top eight of the tournament. Just a weird coincidence I guess. <br/>
<br/>
A big round of thanks for everyone that attended. Thank you to Mike, Brian and Scott for travelling down from Phoenix to play. Thank you to Chris at Kards 4 You for a great site and helping with prize support. Thank you Andres Lopez for setting up the tournament. I hope everyone had a great time, and I'll see you at the next tournament.<br/>
