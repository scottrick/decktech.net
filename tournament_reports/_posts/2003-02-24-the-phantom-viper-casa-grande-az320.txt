<blockquote><font class="bfont"> THE PHANTOM VIPER<br>
2-22-03<br>
<br>
Scot Vales tells me WAY ahead of time that he is thinking about hosting another of his famous scenario tournaments. He sends me a list of the scenario points and we fight over it to make it work, and I'm soon testing <br>
<br>
different decks. In this format (for the sake of prizes &amp; placing), you get 2 points for a scenario win, 1 point for a regular win, 1 point for any modified win, 1 point for a scenario loss, and 0 points for a non-scenario loss. <br>
<br>
A scenario win is when you can complete enough predetermined objectives to gain 10 points. The points my decks were designed to take advantage of are:<br>
<br>
LIGHT SIDE:<br>
2 points for not including any Ep1 cards<br>
2 points for not including any upkeep cards<br>
6 points for the first time the Falcon take off from DB94 with any 4 of the following: Han, Chewie, Luke, Ben, R2-D2, C-3P0<br>
2 points for any persona replacement of Han<br>
1 point for each alien "hit" by Chewbacca with a bowcaster<br>
1 point every time 2 aliens initiate a battle against Jabba at a Tatooine Docking Bay<br>
1 points each time Artoo and Threepio are present at a Tatooine battleground during your draw phase<br>
1 point for playing A Few Manuevers<br>
<br>
DARK SIDE:<br>
2 points for not including any Ep1 cards <br>
2 points for not including any upkeep cards<br>
2 points for having a Tatooine battleground site as my starting location<br>
1 point each time my aliend of ability=1 drains at Mos Eisley or a Tatooine docking bay<br>
1 point each time my opponent's alien or Han lost by a Han Seeker<br>
1 point each battle initiated by Jabba and another alien at a Tatooine docking bay<br>
1 point each time Prophetess retrieves Force<br>
1 point for each Force drain by Jabba with ability &lt; 4<br/>
1 point for playing: Nevar Yalnal &amp; Jabba's Twerps<br/>
<br/>
I was playing a basic mains deck with more aliens than normal as my light, and an alien deck for Dark. I was much more comfortable with my light and wish I had more time to work on the DS, but I just had too much <br/>
<br/>
work to do for school &amp; stuff. Graduating in June, baby!<br/>
<br/>
So every LS game, I start with 4 points and need to have the Falcon take off. The DS starts with 6 and just needs to let Jabba &amp; crew hold the Aud Chamber for 4 turns. The backup plans are just for fun. I just bought <br/>
<br/>
Zach Marshall's collection from him, and I see he's got all these extra Cappy Hans in the box! I tell Pat Hug (the Cappy Han MASTER) that I've got some extra, and I intend to rip him off in order to part with them. He <br/>
<br/>
agrees. ;-) For 3 Captains (and some other stuff, of course), I get 2 Ref3 Obi-Wans, a Lord Maul, a Double Saber. a Destroyer Droid, and Rolling Rolling Rolling. The Obis are for a deck - the rest is for a collection of a <br/>
<br/>
set I never bought. And now the games begin. I'm 1735 going in.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1: LS vs. Brandon's scenario deck (1500)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry dude, I didn't catch your last name! DOH! I'm a scrub. Anyway, this guy's been playing for about a month, so I play appropriately. I put (v) Chewie at the Home One docking bay to generate a few more Force, and <br/>
<br/>
he pulls everything I need to get a successful Falcon in the sky. He pulls EPP Han, then the Falcon, then Squadron Assignments gets Artoo &amp; Threepio, deploy Han, tranist Chewie, take off, and that's how we get 10 <br/>
<br/>
scenario points. I was very proud that I achieved scenario a few minutes before Pat could do it in his game - we were playing nearly identical decks, it turns out. Randomly.<br/>
<br/>
The Falcon subsequently lands to let Chewie and the droid(s) off, adds Leia, replaces Han with the Captain (2 more points!), Ounee Ta gets the good ol' EPP back (just in case), and takes off again next turn. He puts <br/>
<br/>
the Conquest in front of the Falcon and initiates to get his points (he gets 1 point each time the Conquest looks at Light Side's hand), but he soon learns that it's just a bad idea as I draw my 6, 4, and 6 while he's <br/>
<br/>
sitting there without a draw. I neglect to play the Punch It and I Know in my hand because he's new. Anyway, he's got a power 9 ship with 9 forfeit, so he owes me 4 more overflow. I realize I could have ended the <br/>
<br/>
game, but that's not cool for a new player.<br/>
<br/>
He's beating me up on the ground, though. Artoo has a bad feeling and doesn't let Bossk and some other ability 2 scrub draw a destiny, although both the droid combo and the wookiee get hit. I hit Bossk back, netting <br/>
<br/>
me yet another scenario point, but that's about it. I let him sit for a turn while I draw some characters, then Ben &amp; Luke make short work of the last few characters in his deck. I drop Celebration and let Dash take <br/>
<br/>
space while the Falcon crew lands on the 3rd battleground, and he soon draws up.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario Win by 37<br/>
2 (+37)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: He avoided the basic mistakes most of the time: Always had a destiny draw during battle except once, didn't forget to Force drain a single turn (wow), read Goo Nee Tay and the spaceport DB's game text, <br/>
<br/>
and all that. Coolness!<br/>
THE BAD: I was really tempted to play Punch It and I Know in that battle, ending the game about 5 turns in. Had he not been new, it would have happened :-(<br/>
THE UGLY: He was really taking ground pretty well before I finally found Ben. The diff between our life forces was only about 10-15 before Celebration &amp; Ben hit the table.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: A newbie who doesn't forget to Force drain? Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2: DS vs. Scot Vales's "Ow It Hurts" HB (1663)<br/>
<br/>
Scot didn't have the time to build a LS deck because of stuff in his personal life which I don't feel the need to disclose here. It's legit. So instead, I let him use my Hidden Base deck because (1) it's just amusing to do, <br/>
<br/>
(2) it was the only LS deck I had to test against my scenario deck, so I know I can win, (3) the "Lush factor" hasn't been updated yet, so it's not as good as it needs to be, and (4) I don't have another LS deck to give <br/>
<br/>
him. Anyway, I play 5 spies in my scenario deck. I need to get one of them in my opening hand in the worst way or this game is only gonna last about 4 turns.<br/>
<br/>
So who do I get?<br/>
<br/>
MARA JADE!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sweetness. This game is mine. I kill Dodonna as soon as he hits the table, and I sit at the Echo Corridor and wait. I know he needs to put Romas at the War Room, and Rieekan is at the Docking Bay. He's going to <br/>
<br/>
have to move Rieekan over (ALONE) and drop an xwing to the DB to pull off EBO, and I'll be able to beat the living crap out of the good general if he decides to make such a move. Meanwhile, Reegesk has been in the <br/>
<br/>
Audience Chamber since turn 1 with None Shall Pass, Barrier, AND Projective to protect him. He's been stealing xwings and cannons from the lost pile as soon as they hit. Turns out the deck isn't totally complete yet, <br/>
<br/>
as Scot is playing Bargaining Table instead of Rebel Fleet (I didn't have time to replace my proxies!!!). No cancelling drains for you! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
He finally gets the shield up after beating up Mara with a few EPPs (this is the first, non-classic version of HB remember), but he's not doing well in space. He's lost a few wings already, and I've got them in hand. I go <br/>
<br/>
to Kiffex (the system he's got with 2 wings), shoot one of them down, lose 3 worthless cards from hand, and steal his wing I just shot down next turn while saving 3. I spread MY xwings to beat up on HIS xwings and <br/>
<br/>
use the Virago as forfeit fodder in front of a lone xwing, and I'm moving to counter his drains while saving a few to make sure I can shoot stuff down. I also quickly get out the Wampa cave and begin ominously moving <br/>
<br/>
my characters under the shield, a move he doesn't appreciate very much. He's letting my drains of 2 and 3 go by while cancelling my drain of 1 by Jabba (a scenario point) and my drain with Mosep &amp; Gailid at the DB <br/>
<br/>
(another scenario point), and I'm stuck at 9 points. I finally move Jabba out, he cancels the drain at the Aud Chamber, and the drain outside gets my my 10th point. SUCCESS!!! Sweet. And it turns out I can't move an <br/>
<br/>
xwing from Kessel to Tibrin, so he gets a single drain of 3 on me there before being defeated.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario Win by 37<br/>
4 (+74)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: I beat up my own broken deck. I'm really glad I play 5 spies &amp; know the weakness of my own doing.<br/>
THE BAD: Scot's frustrated now. This game just wasn't right because of Reegesk &amp; the early 6 card loss from Dodonna.<br/>
THE UGLY: Him losing Bargaining Table off the top and realizing that this may be more difficult than he first thought. He's also never played this deck, and it's not his style, so it was tougher than he gave it credit for.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Scot's my buddy and takes it in stride.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: DS vs. Pat Hug's scenario (1977)<br/>
<br/>
Judging by the scores, we're going to be playing the last 2 games together. There were battles upon battles upon battles! I know going into this game that my DS doesn't stand much of a chance, since our LS decks <br/>
<br/>
are so close together. But I put out some beats anyway. I wind up getting 15 scenario points this game because he never touches the drain by Jabba in the Audience Chamber (the first time he tried, I dropped a None <br/>
<br/>
Shall Pass, and he didn't do it again). He takes the system with the Home One, and I can't find any ships at all. I steal his Red Leader In Red 1, but that's not enough to take out the flagship, and I can't find any 6s to <br/>
<br/>
track. I also managed to steal a saber or 2, though. He's celebrating all game because I can't do enough damage to his characters at sites. I finally get EPP Vader and Circle ready to do battle against his Ben &amp; Leia, <br/>
<br/>
but turns out he's got a saber, and that's too bad for me. I suicide anyway and draw too low to hit Ben, so of course he doesn't lose anybody. He never deploys Kenobi without a saber, so I can't Circle him. That's really <br/>
<br/>
too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario Loss by 24<br/>
5 (+50)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: There was no good in this game. There aren't enough good aliens to counter a full-out mains attack, so S&amp;V may not have been the best choice for this scenario tournament.<br/>
THE BAD: Not being able to hit Ben, steal his saber, something! No Circle!<br/>
THE UGLY: Not finding any ships or 6s all game kinda hurt, too. That would have turned the tide dramatically.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: You build a good deck. You also couldn't get a scenario win from me.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: LS vs's Pat Hug's randomness scenario (1977)<br/>
<br/>
So he's been ranting &amp; raving about his DS all day long, and I get to see what it's all about. Turns out he's doing mains. All mains. He starts the Cantina and uses the Endor interrupt to get Jabba's Palace, no effects to <br/>
<br/>
start. He decided that he's never played a deck with 6 Emperors in it before, so this would be a good time to try it. He's got those, 2-3 Maras, at least 4 Vaders, and all kinds of cronies to totally anihillate anything that I <br/>
<br/>
could ever hope to throw at him. Oh yeah - he's also playing Spec Ed Jabba to get the last 4 scenario points he needs, and since he's backed up with Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, I can't get to him.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem with this game is that I can't find my characters at all. I've searched through my deck 4 times, and no Han. I finally let Chewie, the droids, and Ben fly to space to get my scenario points, because I'm <br/>
<br/>
really really low on Life Force and I know I can't win. He gets met with Zuckuss, 4LOM, and Bossk. Great. I don't get a draw, and I lost Artoo's bad feeling early on from the top. I lose Ben and a floating Outrider (bad <br/>
<br/>
times for Dash earlier), and I get to deploy Ben next turn with his saber, both of which are in my hand. I finally get Cappy Han and Luke upstairs. He senses my Punch It, but I still wipe his entire fleet away with Han as <br/>
<br/>
my only loss.<br/>
<br/>
Now on the ground. I'm drawing absolutely horrible destiny. I'm talking about my deck of 15 cards that has a single card of destiny 1, all the rest are 5 or higher. It gets shuffled, so it's blind. I don't worry about it <br/>
<br/>
because what are the odds that I'll get the 1? Well, apparently they're pretty good. That sucked. I'm also still having trouble finding my characters. My lack of characters along with the fact that his characters all say <br/>
<br/>
"immune to attrition of whatever Steve draws" mean that I'm going to lose this game. This deck is packed with high destiny, I just can't find it. I can't win with a setup like that, certianly not against Pat.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario Loss by 24<br/>
6 (+26)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: Again - no good in this game. When you're playing mains vs. interrupts, the mains generally win.<br/>
THE BAD: Drawing the only 1 amidst an ocean of destiny 5 and above. Only I could achieve something that bad.<br/>
THE UGLY: Chewie &amp; Artoo as the only pilots to the Falcon? With Ben in the back seat? Come on.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Scrounging up the 6 palpys to put in a deck. Managing a scenario win with this pile.<br/>
<br/>
So I still manage to come in 2nd place overall. I get an Alter foil, which is good because I didn't have one before. I also get a Spec Ed pack out of the prizes. I tell everybody that this is good because I needed a Vader. <br/>
<br/>
Open the pack - IT'S VADER. I should have said that a lot more often back in the day, apparently! Pat speaks up, and I quickly give him the Vader for a few tournament foils I didn't have yet. Good tournament, good <br/>
<br/>
prizes, and fun people, even if only 6 showed up. I'm looking forward to Scot's next scenario tournament, then hopefully a few highly competitive tournaments in Phoenix before DPC Vegas in May! VEGAS BABY!<br/>
<br/>
PROPS:<br/>
* Eloy Public Library for hosting us &amp; having a bigger actual game room than most card shops I've played in. :-) Russ is the coolest!<br/>
* Scot for hosting scenario<br/>
* Everybody who showed up for having a good time<br/>
* Brandon for not forgetting to drain<br/>
* Scot for reminding us all how good landspeed 5 speeder bikes can be on a huge planet<br/>
* Pat for using 6 palpatines<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS:<br/>
* Pat for HAVING 6 palpatines. :-P<br/>
* My boss for trying to call me into work at 7:00 while I was trying to leave!!! ARRGGHHH!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for coming down! Hopefully we'll get more people next time! Scot usually gets MANY more people than this - guess it was just a bad schedule or something. Who knows. See you next time! <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
