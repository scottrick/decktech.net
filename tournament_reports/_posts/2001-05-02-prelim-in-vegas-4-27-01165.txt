<blockquote><font class="bfont"> TR straight outta Awesome Hobbies in Vegas.  Mike Girard was the<br>
and over 30 people showed up.  This was, of course, the prelim to<br>
the DPC on the 28th.  I had just finished an 8.5 hour drive from<br>
San Francisco to Vegas with Clayton Atkin, Ohmy Fasudhani, and<br>
Alfred Dong, but we were 15 minutes or so late and Girard had <br>
already started the tourney.  Luckiliy, some other people came<br>
&amp; wanted to play so we paired up but had to play on the floor.<br>
Time to test my decks and see if they were ready.  Hunt Down <br>
w/unique TIEs for dark (IAO, Mob Pts, Com Response), and EBOX <br>
w/speeders for light.<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS v Casey Barson’s BHBM (from Utah)<br>
<br>
I start ANSB and get EBO going.  He deploys Palpy to his Throne<br>
Room w/Emp’s Power.  Once I get Zev in Rogue 3 to the North Ridge,<br>
he drops Tarkin there (alone).  I don’t battle (since I don’t get<br>
battle destiny), just deploy my fleet to Kiffex, Hoth, and Sullust<br>
and drain for lots.  He loses some red cards like Moment of <br>
Triumph but unfortunately I don’t realize what he’s going to do.  <br>
I continue draining, and he drops Dengar w/gun and hits Hoth Luke<br>
(who is outside the speeder so as not to lose to Your Destiny).  <br>
He loses Dengar and moves Tarkin to the MPG.  I drop Rogue 1 w/<br>
Luke from lost pile and Wedge, RSL to the Ridge and move Zev in<br>
Rogue 3 to Tarkin’s drain.  He drops Greedo to the Ridge, then <br>
moves him to the MPG, Tarkin to the Echo DB.  I’ve been draining<br>
for 10 per turn, and he’s low on force so I battle Greedo and 1st<br>
he plays the dark card which triples the eventual battle damage, <br>
something I did not see coming at all.  Then he plays ResLukRauf,<br>
Lone Warrior, Moment of Triumph, and like 2-3 other adders to get<br/>
7 destiny, which is tripled, so I take 87 damage.  Too bad I <br/>
didn’t have Houjix in hand.  I’d never even seen that tripler card<br/>
used before, so it was actually kinda cool.  Glad I found it out<br/>
now rather than at the DPC.  Lose by 16 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Best: I was basically untouched since Rebel Fleet was cancelling<br/>
Vader’s drain at Endor DB.<br/>
Worst: He didn’t lose the tripler card to drains, otherwise I<br/>
would’ve looked at it and realized I should not battle him.  Live<br/>
and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Mike Sloan’s TIGIH (from So Cal)<br/>
<br/>
Piett hits Endor DB 1st turn, grabs Merrejk and I get Wakeelmui &amp;<br/>
SFS 1st turn.  He activates, but doesn’t move Luke over!  So Vader<br/>
hits the Endor DB next turn, and Visage hits him the rest of the<br/>
game.  He pulls Home One DB and drops Dash there, but Mara goes &amp;<br/>
kills him plus a few.  After a few turns, he moves Luke to have<br/>
Vader capture him, then drops Chewie with gun and Tawss vs Mara<br/>
w/saber.  I lose Mara, he loses Chewie (they missed each other) &amp;<br/>
I stack one.  Merrejk comes down with a few TIE pilots to beat on<br/>
Tawss plus a few more cards.  From there on my drains at Kashyyk,<br/>
Home One DB, Endor, and Endor DB (plus Visage) end the game.  Not<br/>
much to it.  Win by 32.<br/>
<br/>
Best: Him not moving Luke for a couple turns.  Let me get my ships<br/>
out to drain.<br/>
Worst: Mara missing Chewie (drew 2 1’s).<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Eric Bruen’s MKOS Skrillings (from So Cal)<br/>
<br/>
I start Menace Fades, Battle Plan, and Wise Advice.  He flips on<br/>
2nd turn, but I couldn’t get a Signal to get ANSB.  So I got EBO<br/>
out late, like 5th turn.  He had been paying to drain, but Gailid<br/>
wasn’t out so drains of 1 I could handle.  Once I got EBO, I setup<br/>
Menace Fades and had ships at Hoth, Sullust, and Kiffex &amp; also had<br/>
Luke, Hobbie, Wedge, and Zev in Rogues 1 and 3 at the North Ridge.<br/>
But then he dropped Bossk in the Tooth, which I barriered, but he<br/>
plopped 3-4 skrillings aboard it.  Well, I would battle it, but the<br/>
damn skrillings were forfeit 5 or 6 or something and I couldn’t get<br/>
a good beatdown on it.  Then he would just battle and Projective<br/>
Telepathy to retrieve his skrillings with Scum.  So he was draining<br/>
for free now.  So it was a drain race which he won because he could<br/>
cancel 2 of my drains (MKOS and Den of Thieves), I couldn’t cancel<br/>
any (Hutt Influence of course).  Plus he had a few Controls to take<br/>
care of some of my drains.  Lose by 12.  <br/>
<br/>
Best: None, except maybe keeping Menace Fades in effect.  Gailid<br/>
showed up later in the game.<br/>
Worst: Bossk had tons of skrillings marching through his ship.  They<br/>
were also dying by the handful to save Bossk.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Andre Stelly’s HB Mains w/Harvests (from So Cal)<br/>
<br/>
2nd turn Lord Vader hits my Endor DB.  EPP Han and Leia show up and<br/>
he tries to battle, but I point to my objective.  I deploy Vader’s<br/>
stick but don’t have You Are Beaten.  I battle anyway (fearing he<br/>
will beat down Vader if I leave Han and Leia there), and we clear <br/>
each other.  Now he drops Lars Farm, Owen &amp; Beru, EPP Luke, &amp; plays<br/>
Harvest.  Then on my turn, he does it again.  And again on his turn.<br/>
So I’m thinking "jeez, he plays like 8 Harvests."  No, he only plays<br/>
3, and he drew them all (lucky).  So he’s got like no lost pile now.<br/>
I get my space drains going at Endor and Kashhyk and Vader again to<br/>
Endor DB.  However, as the game goes on I get my duel cards and I’m<br/>
ready to duel his guys.  Ben w/stick, EPP Luke, Owen &amp; Beru, and <br/>
Chewie w/gun are all at his Mos Eisley (he also has Cantina out).<br/>
So I pick up Vader, then drop him to Mos Eisley next turn, but he <br/>
barriers.  Oh no.  I have no one to back up Vader with, so he’s<br/>
going to die to these mains next turn.  I decide to duel Luke,<br/>
hoping he will cross him so I have someone to fight alongside Vader,<br/>
and I win, so Luke crosses.  Good.  HOWEVER, he just Snipers Luke<br/>
and beats on Vader, ending the game.  I could’ve Circled Obi in a<br/>
blind duel, but I would’ve lost anyway, so I take the beatdown to<br/>
end the game.  Lose by 18.<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really.  I got out Secret Plans and SSPFT soon after he<br/>
played his 3 Harvests in a row, but he never played another Harvest<br/>
after that (he couldn’t draw them again).  Ironic.<br/>
Worst: Obviously, I had planned on dueling Obi, then moving Vader,<br/>
then moving back and dueling Luke.  The best laid plans.....<br/>
<br/>
Ohmy ends up going 4-0, the rest of us don’t do so well.  There are,<br/>
naturally, a lot of 4-0, and I don’t remember who placed where.  I<br/>
do remember that Brian Hunter came in with some people (Kyle Craft<br/>
one of them), but they didn’t play.  But I did get to catch up with<br/>
my squad from Southern CA, many of whom made the trek to Vegas and <br/>
played in this prelim.  It was fun.  So I head to the hotel and <br/>
figure how I’ll change my decks, if I decide to use them at all in<br/>
the DPC.  Maybe I was just tired from the long road trip.  Thanks<br/>
for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Mike Girard for running the tourney and having some good prizes.<br/>
Casey for showing me that new decktype.  That is ingenious.<br/>
The whole So Cal squad for showing up, I half expected them to bail<br/>
and not show up to the DPC.<br/>
Ohmy for going 4-0.<br/>
Everyone who read this &amp; my DPC report.<br/>
Eric Bruen for scouting me on decktech.  He knew EXACTLY what I was<br/>
playing because he read my TRs and decks I post.  You’re a smart<br/>
guy, and an awesome player.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
Hmmmm.....no slops.  I guess I’m feeling nice today. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
