<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pre tourney stuff: I recently turned 18 so thats cool, and on my 18th birthday I got ran over by car on my motorcycle so that wasnt cool. Completely the other guys fault and he didnt have insurance, a drivers license, and he didnt speak English he was like Arabic. So for the tourney I was on vicadin  but on like crutches too and was in a slight amount of pain. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Deck stuff:<br>
So before the tourney I had no idea what to play cause I have a very select base of cards that let me play only certain kinds of decks. The first day was the team tourney and I knew I didnt have to play super amazing decks. Originally I  had a qmc that played with non unique speeders at exterior sites but I decided that sucked lol. So I changed it to more of an epp mains deck that could be very fast if I needed it too. The space package was mainly booster in skate and boshek, with boshek pulling the landing claw.<br>
<br>
 For darkside I had weather vain cloud city deck that puts guri in space and has a bunch of tricks and stuff.<br>
<br>
So first day is team tourney and I randomly get assigned tanner barnharst as my partner. Tanner is from rosemount just like me and I helped him make both his decks. We decided he should be dark cause he was playing tto and thats more or less an autoplay deck cause he has only been playing for a couple of years. <br>
<br>
FYI for team tourney you played only one side, and winners got mugs<br>
<br>
My first game is QMC vs. CCT starting 3 effects  and free executor<br>
<br>
I wasnt really expecting to play cct, he got despair out right away and had lord vader escorting jabbas prize. That hurt cause I was playing like 5 dodges and couldnt really run away. I ended up trapping vader with a well timed path, added lando scoundrel for the beat and got jabbas prize freed. In the meantime I had boshek with the claw in space holding battle plan. In the end there wasnt much he could do and I ended up winning. FW<br>
<br>
Game 2 QMC vs. Imperial Entaglements played by tyler vastag<br>
<br>
Not much here, was pretty much a drain race with me setting up booster in skate with the claw turn one and playing kal fal to site for weapons display. Just a drain race with the claw being the superstar again. Tough for tyler because he had to put too many cards on the table. I ended up winning. FW<br>
<br>
Game 3 QMC vs. combat by peter frafjord<br>
a game I new I should I win, but was very close.  I put the my guy in space but with mirax as matching pilot so I could have tracking right away. He put maul out turn 1 to his combat site. Oh yea I forgot to put menace fades in my deck so that was pretty bad. Basically I got the retrieval set up and played quigon to his site so he couldnt battle me anywhere, and started to draw my tracked destinies. Not much he could do at the end when I was retrieving 3 and ping for 3 when all he could do was combat and I had my high destinies stacked. FW<br>
<br>
game 4 QMC vs. cor mains by brian herold <br/>
I was disappointed to see this matchup as I knew that mains usually shut down qmc. He played emperor to my site with precautions like first turn and I just set up in space and saved. Second turn I threw out to scrubs to flip and got a card from my force pile, obi with stick, then moved by scrubs over to consolidate at a site. His turn I took clash from force pile, he played vader and 3b310 to my site battled and cleared me. My turn I took screaming lando. Played screaming lando, obi with stick to vaders site, clashed vader, battled drew to blind 5s and promptly basically ended the game as he took like 16 over flow.  FW<br/>
<br/>
So day 1 ended up going undefeated with qmc and tanner went 2 and 2 so we ended up getting second losing only in differential to tyler vastag and max maltese. We were both pissed cause we wanted those mugs! Stay tuned for day 2 and 3<br/>
