<blockquote><font class="bfont"> I have been away from the tournament scene quite a bit over the past few years, missing just about every major event Texas has had to offer for almost the entire time.  This time was different.  My wife and I didnt have to work, so I was off to San Antonio with fellow Team Stephenvilleer and good friend, JW Asphalizo Millet.  I show up at his place with my usual tournament fare: cup of girlie coffee, box of Pop Tarts, Homer Simpson shirt, and two okay decks.<br>
<br>
What I brought:<br>
DS - Tanks for the Memories, Senate Tanks<br>
LS - Team Stephenvilles Anal Probe (A.K.A. Podracing is a Pain in the Ass), TIGIH Racing<br>
<br>
JW and I arrive despite crappy internet directions, some of the worst construction Ive ever seen, and me needing to pee as much as an old lady.  We end up getting 7 total players, but were expecting more.  On to the show!<br>
<br>
Game 1 - me (DS) vs. Matthew Ortizs Hidden Base matching pilots<br>
<br>
I had never met Matthew before, but from the start he was a pretty nice guy.  I thought this was a pretty tough matchup, cuz he has the best chance to drain early and for a lot.  I get a Monnok in my opening hand and decide to use it on my second turn, thinking I may get something good.  No dice, the only double he had before was a Hyper Escape that he lost to my drain earlier.  However, after that and a search of his reserve deck after he couldnt get a matching pilot, I saw that I may have a good chance with the Zuckuss In Mist Hunter x2 and Darth Maul/Sith Infiltrator/Geela Yeens (V) space package I was packing (as well as Security Precautions too, yay!).  As quickly and as efficiently as I can, I flip my objective, get an AAT/Tank Commander/AAT Laser Cannon to the Battle Plains, my Political Effects, and two ZiMHs in my hand.  Matthew throws Obi Wan with Lightsaber at me twice and I hit him both times, utilizing the unique battle droid 3B3-888 to subtract 3 from an opponents defense value (HUUUUUGE props to John Legspinner Clark for providing us to one grand element we here in Stephenville have been missing).  After all of that, I am ready to start probing.  Matthew causes me to lose some cards to the one drain he could get through and after a hit and run I perform on him against BoShek (V) and Hobbies X-Wing, I put three probe cards down and place his objective out of play.  His drain canceling is gone, he has to spread out and evade me while getting his biggest drain canceled.  I get Baskol Yeesrim to the Senate to cause ping damage, get out Search &amp; Destroy, and add 2 to my drain at the Docking Bay I eventually got out with an AAT there too.  We nearly go to time, but I finish Matthew off with a scare and a +21 differential.<br>
FW: 2(+21)<br>
Props:  meeting another nice guy<br>
             Hitting Obi two times without losing anything<br>
              Probing only 3 times with minimal damage to me<br>
Slops:  overreacting on the Monnokwhoops<br>
<br>
Game 2 - me (LS) vs. Philip Reynas Bring Him Before Me<br>
<br>
Uh oh.  I was playing the trickiest matchup possible.  No wait.  We were BOTH playing the trickiest matchup possible.  We spend countless times looking at each others objectives, then our own, then each others..WOW.  We were both dumbfounded for quite some time, but started to get things rolling.  I am podracing, and starting Seeking An Audience to pull Nekkid Threepio.  Philip deploys the Emperor to his Throne Room on the DS2, and gets The Emperors Power (V) on him.  I move Luke over to the Endor Landing Platform just so he can drain effectively.  I start drawing &amp; Threepio-ing to get everything I need, and keeping my podracing total just under 24 until I need it.  I start looking for Boss Nass Chambers, Corran Horn, and anybody with a lightsaber.  In the meantime, Philip gets Blizzard 4, a Stormtrooper Garrison, and Moff Jerjerrod out and starts draining.  I am having trouble trying to get my stuff, but Vader doesnt quite make an appearance yet, so only a slight trickle of damage to begin with.  I decide that maybe Vader someday later will show up, so I DB transit Luke to the DS2 docking bay to get himself captured and cause some big damage to him instead..but alas, Vader does show up with his stick.  Now my attention shifts to winning battles to make this easier!  No small task as I throw down Corran and Obi to the Throne Room, expecting an Imperial Barrier, cuz I got counters in my hand.  Nope, he lets me initiate, I miss Vader, he hits Obi, plays I Have You Now much to my chagrin, and I lose everybody.  He only loses Vader, cuz I find out next turn he had one in his hand.grrrr..  So now, I decide to win the Podrace, but Philip wisely has the Coward shield out to make me work for it.  I had deployed Tantive IV(V) and Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V) backed up with a Spiral to his Corulag.  I get Mace(V) to his forces, play Smoke Screen, and take about 11 overflow just to keep Mace out.  I hope that Philip doesnt have much in his hand to come after me so I can retrieve, but I was wrong..Philip finishes me off, I lose by 14.<br>
FL: 2(+7)<br>
Props:  dont know if there are anybad matchup<br>
Slops:  He seemed scared of my Luke, shouldve waited<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: bye<br/>
<br/>
I finish out my command cards, and Michael Richards wants to play in the meantime.  He busts out his Cartman to try against my Senate Tanks and even though the round ended while the game still was undecided, I think I couldve taken him.<br/>
FW: 4(+7)<br/>
Props:  easiest win all day<br/>
              Swatting down Lukes T-16 and Threepio thus making him afraid of me.hee hee<br/>
Slops:  Richards thinks he couldve taken me<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: me (DS) vs. JW Millets QMC Aliens<br/>
<br/>
Well.thats what I get for being 2-1.  I get one of the decks that just wrecks mine, which is usually anything fast, gives no exterior sites, drains that cant be cancelled, and retrieval.  Unfortunately, JWs deck has all of that.  I decide that my only hope is to get the Gemmeperor to Cloud City as soon as I can to do some damage if he decides to come at me, even if he leaves me alone I get another drain.  JW gave me the latter.  I try my hardest to do as much damage as I can as fast as I can.  I flip early, get an AAT package to the Battle Plains, put Gemmeperor to the Guest Quarters, and get my +2 drain Politiffect.  JW sends Jar Jar at me at the BP, makes me lose a Tank Commander, sends Jar Jar used.  He starts draining me for a lot, retrieving a bit, and since I cant cancel his drains or his Celebration, he finishes me off fairly quickly.  I lose by quite a bit, near 20 or so.<br/>
FL:  4 (-something)<br/>
Props:  none, JW beat the crap out of me<br/>
Slops:  I think I need a Mara or Vader with Stick in there.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: me (DS) vs. James (I forgot his last name, sorry) Senate Speeders<br/>
<br/>
Doh!  Another toughie!  I know that the key to this (duh) is establishing control of the Senate, and thats exactly what we do.  Not much in the line of play-by-play for that, all we did is see-saw the majority back and forth.  He loses some guys, I lose some guys.  I used The Point Is Conceded (glad I didnt take that one out, whew!) to put my crappy guy used, and put his Mon Mothma (V) used so I could use The Emperor (V) to start zapping his guys.  I bit off more than I could chew there, by targeting  Senator Palpatine first.  I missed and we spent the next few turns subsequently placing senators on Political Effects all the live-long day, mostly to add 3 to the six I drew so that James could subtract 3 from it to leave me with a.six.  All in all, it left me with Lott Dodd and Toonbuck Toora controlling the Senate.  So while all that was happening, James has thrown Chewie (V) in the Falcon, along with Mirax Terrik and the Pulsar Skate to Kashhyyk and drains me for one when my Political Effect doesnt get it canceled.  Also, he has thrown Commander Luke (V) and Rogue 1 at my lone AAT package (AAT, Tank Commander, AAT Laser Cannon) and also throwing  Dash Rendar (V) with Hobbies speeder at me.  We go back and forth there, cuz I think that targeting a vehicle with my Laser Cannons costs a force like it does when you target a character.  Next time Ill have to read my cards I guess.  I eventually gain control of the Battle Plains, but time is winding down.  I cant damage him fast enough, and he cant damage me enough.  We go to time, but I win by 20.<br/>
TW 5(around 7 I think)<br/>
Props:  DS Senate isnt supposed to gain control of the Senate in this matchupwoot.<br/>
              Again shooting everything down that came my way, including maneuver 6 speeders.<br/>
                I didnt know it, but James knew me somehow.  I didnt know he was the guy I helped get in touch with Nick Reisch and got him back in the game.  So that felt kinda cool.<br/>
Slops:  Third game this tourney that was a crappy matchup.  Blecchhh.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: me (LS) vs. Matthew Ortizs Walkers<br/>
<br/>
Yay!  A toughie, but one I was expecting, or at least I knew what to do against it.  In my opening hand I get one of my two Imperial Atrocitys (V), and quite quickly get the other one.  I start looking for my two spies and Leia, Rebel Hottie to minimize Matthews damage.  Everything seems to go my way this time, I reduce the damage from him blowing away the Generators to 6, but eventually he deploys Tatooine Maul to the 3rd marker to finally have a non-alien present at the site to satisfy Leias game text, but I Rebel Barrier him and take the fight to my turn, where I deploy Qui-Gon with Stick to go with Leia, Wedge, Rogue Squadron Leader, and Lando, Scoundrel for 3 battle destinies.  I clear his site fairly quickly retrieve with the podrace, and drain him away eventually.  Nothing really exciting for this game, it just seemed to all be in my favor, and keeping Matthew on his heels.  With that, I finish Matthew off and win by 21.<br/>
FW:  7(+24 I believe)<br/>
Props: actually doing well against a deck designed not to let you do well<br/>
             Another good game against a nice guy<br/>
Slops:  None.  Good game.<br/>
<br/>
So all is said and done, and I end up finishing 5th out of 7.  I would have gotten 3rd if it werent the timed win, but I wasnt there to win, I was there to have a good time.  Which I did.  I still had a great time, so much that I even forgot about the preview cards.  Congrats to JW finally getting his bye to Day 2.<br/>
<br/>
Tourney After-Party @ Chilis!  They hold James hamburger hostage, Gabe tries to look important by ordering obscure beer that may or may not exist (j/k), and I TOTALLY thought that the Hispanic chick making balloons for the kids was a hooker.  No joke.  She had a wig you know.<br/>
<br/>
Great times, new friends, good games.  San Antonio is the shiznitabimbomb.  W00t.<br/>
