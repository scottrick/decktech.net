Apologies in advance for the lack of details in all thistrying to do it by memory more than a week after the fact. <br>
<br>
Pre-tourny goodness<br>
<br>
Ok, so Friday I start building my decks for the coming weekend. I finish building my two decks about 6pm, eat dinner then head over to Jareds house for a night of playtesting and tweaking (and building two more decks for Mike Bahr, whom is in need of decks having now sold his entire collection).  I get to Jareds about 8pm and Steve Marshall is already there, with the McCormak boys scheduled to show a bit later in the evening.  We playtest a bit (my dark deck bringing a massive beatdown on Jareds lone Dash in Outrider on my 2nd turn for like 18 overflow where I hit the outrider with a turbolaser battery drawing a 1 and a 2 for destiny) and I construct a basic EBOX for Mike.  Building a dark deck (ending up being an invasion build based upon destiny 8 rifles) for Mike doesnt finish until about 5:30am due to a variety of circumstances, including pizza and a plethora of movies including SWAT, Caddyshack, Harry Potter, The Three Musketeers, and of course the indispendible Space Balls.  Anyway, we go to sleep about 6am and wake up about 8am2 hours of sleep is about average for Arizona tournaments.  <br>

Arizona States Tournament Report <br>
<br>
Tourny starts at 10am, we leave about 9 get there on timebut first round doesnt go off till 10:40ishabout average for AZ tournaments. <br>
<br>
Game 1 <br>
My LS (Jedi take back Tatooine) vs. Andrews Watto.  <br>
Anyway, first game I match up against Andrew McCormack.  I start game by converting junkyard and deploying The Camp.  I should have easily had this game, but some fundamental mistakes remind me of why I consistently scrub games.  I start by getting Yoda and the chamber out pretty quick and getting a couple jedi to tatooine (Ben Kenobi and Plo koon I think).  Some poor luck leaves my jedi without lightsabers for most of the game, but I still clear the junkyard 3 or 4 times (watto dies many times over).  Unfortunately for me, I neglect to read the zero side of andrews objective and let him drain me for 4 each turn at the cantina with maul and like 2 somewhere else on tatooine.  He wins drain race as I lose celebration and cant afford to deploy liberty at Tatooine system. <br>
FL I think diff was about -10ish. <br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My DS (Fun with Turbolasers) vs. Drews (I dont play space) TIGIH. <br>
This game was so terrible. I cant even begin to discuss how terrible it was.  My Dark deck is entirely geared to dominate space.  Drew saves up like 30 force so I fear a beatdown and build up on my 2 systems like mad. Net result is I overdeploy like crazy: 2-3 star destroyers per system, pilots, guns, etc. Comes down to the drain race, which Im wining. Despite having soaked up a lot of early damage, Im draining him for 10/turn and hes getting me for like 3.  It comes down to last turn. Ive got like 5 cards left, hes got exactly 10. Stupidly, I play Firepower (V) shield thinking Ill retrieve 1 since Im satisfying battle order, etc. He doesnt deploy anybody and I waste my last shield (where I should have put down resistance to minimize his drain by 1).  I figure Im okay, as I can soak his drain and still have 1 life force left, so I can drain him out on my turn.  End result: Rebel Artillery ended my day real bad.  <br>
FL -9<br>
<br>
Game 3<br/>
My LS vs. Drews DS (dont remember what it wasI think scum w/capturing). <br/>
Ok, so Im feeling pretty down at this point, thinking that my shot at finishing in the top is gone.  This game goes substantially better, with my Jedis wrecking major havoc on tatooine, winning battles and draining like madmen. I think Depa was the only one who ever died. <br/>
FW +20ish<br/>
<br/>
Break for lunch.  Rus has sub sandwiches brought in.  Rus is da man. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My memory gets a little foggy at this point, but I think I hit a guy at the bottom tables with my DS deck.  If I recall correctly he is playing hidden base corvettes/guns, which is a fantastic match up for my Star Destroyer/turbolaser creation.  Basically it comes down to third turn where I get the beatdown on him.  Having deployed executor, flagship, Admiral Piett, motti (V), rendlli stardrive, and precision targeting (V), the judicator proceeds to lay a beatdown on a YT-1300 freighter after making a corvette lost12 overflow with just judicator and a couple turbolasers (I didnt even draw destiny). I set up the drain of 6 for rest of game.  <br/>
FW by high 20s. <br/>
<br/>
At this point Im 2/2 with positive differential, so I figure Ill give it my all the last two rounds.  Lessenews from other tables.  Pat had been wrecking with LS senate all day, Watto was really popular with like 4 out of 13 people playing it (and it winning for the most part).  The EBO deck I built did well for Mike, but the Invasion build was much more fun from what I hear (and more promising for future tournys). <br/>
<br/>
Game 5 <br/>
I get to play my Dark deck again, this time against Andrew who has had moderate success since he obliterated me in the first round.  He plays hidden mains.  My dark deck brings the hurt this game.  He starts by putting out gen. calrissian on gold 1 at endor first turn.  I spend 1 turn setting up executor/crew, then lay down the big guns on turn 2. No judicator this time, but Chimera gets the job done with 2 turbolaser batteries. He draws a 6 for battle destiny, I sack both my guns, but in the process I hit him easily, and reduce his power to 0, and make him take 10 overflow after sacking precision targeting to make falcon forfeit zero (he still forfeited lando for like 7). That sets him back enough that the game is mine. <br/>
FW by mid 20s. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
My LS vs. Tatooine CCT/scum (forgot the kids name).  Pretty uneventful game. In about 4 turns my jedi kill roughly 12 DS characters (with Mace accounting for 4 of those). Game is short and I get the FW by high 30s. <br/>
<br/>
So I end up going 4-2 with pretty high differential, which is enough to yield me third place. Not bad for scrubbing out first two games.  While my LS performed well (it could use a couple more jedi apparently) I was more interested in the surprising success of my DS big blue guns deck.  Despite putting like 20 cards on table first two turns and pulling a ridiculous amount of cards, it performed quite well (as long as LS played at least 1 starship). The sick part of that deck is that Turbolasters are considered blastersmaybe Ill post a decklist at some point and identify why that is soo good (of course adding 8 to your turbolaser destiny total helps a bit too). <br/>
<br/>
Pat wins first place and the bye, Jared takes second, and I follow after.  I cant remember the rest of the results. For my troubles I am rewarded with a Jar Jar playtest card from reflections gold. Pat runs away with the Anakin Skywalker (whos power 3 was scribbled out and reduced to 2). <br/>
<br/>
Saturday concludes with festivities at Russ house, primarily forcused on the ingestation of beer and beef while playing 7-way Liar with 35 dice.  Apparently I play dice better than SWCCG as I went unbeaten for the last 3 or 4 games. <br/>
<br/>
Props: <br/>
Rus for holding an amazing tournament and charging a steal of an entry fee. <br/>
Jared for holding the night-before party. <br/>
Old school guys for coming (Aaron, Andrew, Steven, Ben)<br/>
Pat for always playing good decks and winning <br/>
Spaceballs for being such a great piece of cinematic brilliance. <br/>
Beer + Dice = fun. <br/>
<br/>
Slops: <br/>
Guys who didnt show up<br/>
Guys who dont play space. <br/>
Lack of sleep being tradition. <br/>
Pat for always playing good decks and never giving anybody else a chance to win. <br/>

Tatooine Regionals Tournament Report <br/>
<br/>
Sunday begins with a large mess at the comic store.  Apparently the assistant manager with whom I made arrangements quit and didnt bother to tell anybody about the tournament or the fact that we needed the doors of the shop to open at 10 instead of 11am. As a result, all 10 of end up sitting on the sidewalk in the heat for an hour waiting for the dang store to open.  The irony is that while we first round didnt go off until 11:30, getting into the store earlier wouldnt have helped, as we were held up by everybody not having decklists prepared.  Apparently its another Arizona tradition to not have a decklist made, thus enhancing the adherence to the age old Arizona tradition of never being able to start a tournament on time. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, 10 guys show up for my little tourney, with 4 guys showing who didnt show the day before (meaning that like 5 people didnt make it up from Eloy which is teh suck). Shaner and Steve show up later in the day to partake in the spectacle as independent observers. Hopefully some other ppl will post more specific details about their games. From what I remember some of the decks were Rops with speeder bikes, several decks that podraced, training, Bring him, more watto, EBO, Eops, Hyperdrive, dark deal with troopers, and some other stuff I cant remember. Full results posted below.  Highlight of the day included a stalemate between Erik E-3P0 and Filipe, neither of whom deemed it necessary to include battlegrounds or spies in their decks. (that game basically came down to whoever put fewer cards on table (which was NOT the training deck much to Eriks disappointment)Fillipe won that one with whopping differential of +47 (and it should have been +50, but he didnt realize the stalemate until like 6 turns in). As a result of that game, I became quite friendly with the new 200-page rules document. <br/>
