<br>
After months of preparation and planning we finally managed to hold a tournament in the UK.  Sadly, only 5 of us turned up so the tournament wasn't sanctioned but that's pretty much irrelevant since the objective for the day was to have fun, meet other players and try to show to other retired SWCCG players that there is still some life in the game.<br>
<br>
Since the tournament wasn't sanctioned and I've worked ridiculously hard to even get anybody here I decided to play even though it would create a bye (this worked out nicely since it gave our two tournament virgins a chance to sit and watch the other games).<br>
<br>
<br>
Just in case anybody cares (and to make my friend Paul happy), here are the results round by round.<br>
<br>
<br>
Round One #1<br>
<br>
Paul McPherson (MWYHL) FL(-8) vs Archer Lee (Endor Operations) FW(+8)<br>
Richard Danes (LSC) FL(-17) vs James Orton (Imperial Occupation v) FW(+17)<br>
Darren Pilbeam (Bye)<br>
<br>
James Orton 2(+17)<br>
Archer Lee 2(+8)<br>
Darren Pilbeam 2(0)<br>
Paul McPherson 0(-8)<br>
Richard Danes 0(-17)<br>
<br>
<br/>
Round One #2<br/>
<br/>
Archer Lee (Local Uprising v) FL(-12) vs Paul McPherson (LSC) FW(+12)<br/>
James Orton (TIGIH) FL(-27) vs Darren Pilbeam (LSC) FW(+27)<br/>
Richard Danes (Bye)<br/>
<br/>
Darren Pilbeam 4(+27)<br/>
Paul McPherson 2(+12)<br/>
James Orton 2(-10)<br/>
Archer Lee 2(-12)<br/>
Richard Danes 2(-17)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round Two #1<br/>
<br/>
Paul McPherson (MWYHL) FW(+27) vs Darren Pilbeam (LSC) FL(-27)<br/>
James Orton (TIGIH) FL(-34) vs Richard Danes (Tatooine CRv) FW(+34)<br/>
Archer Lee (Bye)<br/>
<br/>
Paul McPherson 4(+39)<br/>
Richard Danes 4(+17)<br/>
Darren Pilbeam 4(0)<br/>
Archer Lee 4(-12)<br/>
James Orton 2(-44)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round Two #2<br/>
<br/>
Richard Danes (LSC) FL(-32) vs Paul McPherson (LSC) FW(+32)<br/>
Darren Pilbeam (LSC) FW(+21) vs Archer Lee (Endor Operations) FL(-21)<br/>
James Orton (Bye)<br/>
<br/>
So the final standings were:<br/>
<br/>
Paul McPherson 6(+71)<br/>
Darren Pilbeam 6(+21)<br/>
Richard Danes 4(-15)<br/>
Archer Lee 4(-33)<br/>
James Orton 4(-44)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Props go to:<br/>
<br/>
James for being magnanimous in defeat.<br/>
Paul for beating me in my own podrace and for putting Vader out of play in a duel.<br/>
Archer for travelling up from London on the train to play in his first ever tournament - even though he didn't have his own cards - and for successfully capturing HCF with a tractor beam.<br/>
Richard for driving down from Leeds - also to his first ever tournament.<br/>
Everyone for winning at least one game.<br/>
Phoenix Games, Leicester for letting us have the venue for free. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
