<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Hmmm, <br>
<br>
Enter really interesting text about going to Syracuse with Shaw, Kafer and Tom Schwarz.<br>
<br>
<br>
We show up at Altered States and see about 10-15 people filling out decklists.  We see some familiar faces (asking for prize support :)  and get some photocopies made, fill the lists out and finally finish.  I added a few cards I needed...plus forgot to get a shield for my LS deck. Oh well.<br>
<br>
I am running my Light Hyperdrive with Krayt Dragon Howl (V) start.  For Dark, I am running my Mystic Visions DS winning deck with about 5 cards modified (see my page).<br>
<br>
We end up getting 25 people.<br>
<br>
rd 1, game 1: (DS) Justin Roth WYS(V)<br>
<br>
Justin and I sit down and he tells me he hasnt played in a while.  He is running Reid's WYS (card for card?) off DT.  I start CC and my stuff.  I draw Milwaukee so instead I sac Mob Pts combo and get Sec Pre for a bit more generation along with the Landing site (put epp maul there) and the Wampa cave.  I then use Combat Response to get Dengar from hand with ship.  He uses Drop! to activate 1 and barriers :)...oh well.<br>
<br>
His turn he does a ton of stuff and since I left some force I have a bunch to do some things with.  He drops Laudica, Gen Solo and flips and drop the AO.  I SFS dash on the second try during his draw phase, since he doenst battle and its just Leebo now.  My turn I drop Bossk with his ship, battle the droid and kill both off.  At this point and the rest of the game, I am doubling his activation (and then even more than double).<br>
<br>
I eventually get firepower up and running, moving maul, etc after him and retrieving twice with After Her!.  I push him off Kessel with some beats involving Fett and my drains just did him in.<br>
<br>
 FW +29; 2 (29) <br>
<br>
Good: Activation in this deck is sick.  I was getting 16 or so by turn 2/3 and started ditching stuff after a while.<br>
Bad: Nothing really<br>
<br>
Turns out the 4 of us after game 1 were +36, +32, +3-, +29 (or so)...ugh<br>
<br>
rd 1, game 2: (LS) Tom Schwarz Walkers<br>
<br>
I show up for an event 4 hrs away and play Tom.  He is using Walkers (shaw's version) which kicks WYS(V) pretty good.  They felt it was a solid call that would work in the Meta.  <br>
<br>
This game pretty much ticked Tom off.  He basically did nothing the entire game.  I slowly killed him and then when he finally got something going, I was able to disrupt him and even get off some retrieval with my objective flipped. Ugly for him.  But at least he was still in contention.<br>
<br>
FW +36; 4 (65) <br/>
<br/>
Good: Blizzard 1 being deployed 4 or 5 times.<br/>
Bad: Um, it was someone I went to the event with.<br/>
<br/>
rd 2, game 1: (LS) Greg Shaw Walkers<br/>
<br/>
Same matchup except Greg knows my LS inside and out.  His walkers if done right can beat me, I can win but with some luck.<br/>
<br/>
He drops Zuck to the system and Lord Vader with Dengar to the 2-0.  My turn I say 'if I am going to win, I need to take some chances'.  I Nabrun Obi to the 2-0 and play SATM...Draw a 2 and a 2.  Crap.  Play a droid, battle, try and cut vader...draw a 2-2.  Crap.  For destiny I draw a 1.<br/>
<br/>
Game.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make something happen and it screwed me.  From then on I was not trying to win, but lose by as little as possible.<br/>
<br/>
FL -18; 4 (47) <br/>
<br/>
Good: Had a plan.<br/>
Bad: It didnt come together.<br/>
<br/>
rd 2, game 2: (DS) Alexander Levine LS Combat<br/>
<br/>
This game was a good one.  It went back and forth me draining him combatting, etc.  I started AAA and played the shield so he would get no combat destinies, but he still won all 3 combats blind with no tracking.  Because of this it definately kept it close.  I drained every where I could and EPP Maul with 12 overflow ended it.  I basically had Milwaukee uncontested for a drain of 1 the entire game and hit him for drains when I could.<br/>
<br/>
FW +14; 6 (61) <br/>
<br/>
Good: My activation was above 20 - to his 10 or so the whole game.  Activation is a beast with this deck.<br/>
Bad: Combat losses :)  He won every one blind....<br/>
<br/>
rd 3, game 1: (DS) Bill Kafer Careful Planning Tatooine<br/>
<br/>
This game was actually very close.  I had Zuck at the system draining for two most of the game (never contested with 4lom in the back seat) and The Empy at the Outskirts with Presence.  We battled a bit at the Outskirts but Elis helped keep me alive and prevent a flagship drain while also allowing me to get back to the Outskirts quickly with Firepower (V).  He drained the entire game at the Junkyard and my drains finally knocked him out when he couldnt pay to drain. <br/>
<br/>
FW +5; 8 (66)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Black Sun Fleet taking off during the control phase to occupy last turn and get the drain of 5 in.<br/>
Bad: Credits having me stack every turn he could pay to drain.<br/>
<br/>
rd 3, game 2: (LS) Seth Maser TDIGWATT (Dark Deal)<br/>
<br/>
last game I apparently was 4-1 and 4th place.  Matching me up with Seth instead of Kafer (who we both thought were going to play each other).<br/>
<br/>
First turn seth gives me a hand of 8 cards because of drop.  Pulling sites, matching ships, effects, etc.  I enjoyed starting my turn with a full hand and a ton of active force. He tried to deploy a free exectutor but I altered the Effect after it deployed. He settled on Zuck in MH on turn 2 or 3 instead.<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty uneventful on Tatooine.  obi, saber, prof, gave me a stack + drain of <br/>
3 most of the game (2 for the first few times).  Never contested.  This allowed me to run Qui-Gon, Tawss, Panaka, and Queen on Cloud City.  He tried to deploy Dark Deal, I gave it back to him, then he could never satisfy it again, so he just lost it later.  Occupation and drains did pick up, but Edge gave me some retrieval and I owned cloud city late in the game with my drains and Obi doing way to much for him to handle.<br/>
<br/>
FW +18; 10 (84)<br/>
<br/>
Good: He was really slowed down because of the Alter early game. Goo Nee Tay turn 1 = priceless.<br/>
Bad: Occupation.<br/>
<br/>
So at the end of it, I end up in first against Justin again.  Props to Justin for taking a big loss in game.<br/>
<br/>
They gave out some prizes (foils, uncut sheets, etc) and Justin and I played our final duel.  I got to choose the side being the only 5-1 (a few others were 5-1 with timed wins apparently Greg, etc).<br/>
<br/>
I chose LS vs his DS deck.<br/>
<br/>
Final Duel game 1.  <br/>
<br/>
Justin was using CR (V) with Tatooine (Reid's DS).<br/>
<br/>
He starts JP and the AC, I start the usual.  He basically puts a few guys at the AC turn 1, I get a few cards with Drop! (or the LS version -- whatever :).  I basically drain and drain, play Goo and keep CZ-3 with Obi while I wait for his Elis' to come after me.  Eventually he gets DR E on the Space Cruiser and a few guys at the AC doing there thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Tech Move of the day:<br/>
I have Obi-Wan with Lightsaber and Pro sitting at the site with CZ-3.  He deploys: Baba Fett, BH, Lando, P-59 and 4Lom to my site.  He initiates, retrieves 2 with Scum.  I react with Panaka, his gun, the Journal, then Poop the droid with Dont Forget The Droids (V).  He goes from shooting people with lots of destinies, to shooting no one and getting no destinies.  I cut someone, shoot someone, add a destiny with the interrupt and basically kill everyone off but 4lom.  I have everyone else and he stacks a card.  <br/>
<br/>
The game ended up close late game with him elising Xizor away from Amidala and Qui-Gon (after a battle with Jabba and Friends took out Panaka - and vice versa).  Obi and Jabba left one turn later leaving Xizor, etc to roam tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
I battle Xizor with Amidala, and we both screw up (after playing for 10 hrs of SW or some ungodly hour) and draw battle destiny, killing both.  We are left with qui-gon and dr e combo clearing a site and we are both left with no characters on the table, 3 force for me and 2 for him.  After debating....we call it a timed win +3 for me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 never happened again.  The store closed, we were kicked out and he had an hour drive back to rochestor.  We split the prize (I got an extra $15) and he is getting to design the Virtual Card...<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
The director, players, etc. (who are too numerous to mention)<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Um, timed wins for everyone.  I hate those!<br/>
My tournament reports.  I really have problems finishing them or giving more details.  ADHD sucks :)<br/>
