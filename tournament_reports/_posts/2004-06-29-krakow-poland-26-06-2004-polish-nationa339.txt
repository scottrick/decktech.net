<blockquote><font class="bfont"> The year have passed since last Nationals and once again we were in Krakow (my home town btw  ). Like last year we were scheduled to play at one of our many pubs, and we did. I was hoping for some more people (last year we had 22 people playing if I remember right), but only 14 of us showed up. But hey, its still not a bad resault, as for example LOTR tournament which was taking place in the same pub gathered the same or around. <br>
For me it all started at about 9:30 AM as I was the one putting this whole event together and I had to pick up some people from the train station. So we had some time for some early trading as the tournament wouldnt start earlier than 11 AM. There was a small delay as always, but I came to believe (after organizing a tournament or twenty) that it is unavoidable, so we were all ready for this. At 11:20 we were missing only one guy, who I knew will be late s he had a wedding to attend to (but not his own ;) ). So we started and. I was playing DS Walkers  deck unbeaten in a tournament play for over a year (of course there were a slight changes especialy for a tournament, but thats a different story); and LS modified swarm Hidden Base (I wont be writing any details as I might use it during european Championships which I hope I will be able to attend to)which wasnt tested very much (still, 5 days in a row, 6-8 hours each isnt that little  ), but the tests were more than promising so I decided to use this deck in the tournament. <br>
<br>
My first game was DS against Wojtek Bogusz (Lysy) and his TISGIH. Wojciech was one of he first ones to play SW in Poland, he didnt have too much big succeses for all these years, but he is one of the Polish SW Legends. And we had a score to settled as he beat me last time we met in a tournament (true, it was like 4 years ago, but these kind of things cannot go unpunished  ). Anyway first two turns I set up on Hoth, he set up on endot. There wasnt much interfering with each other for the whole game, but I was happy with that as Hoth is much faster, even after my one very unlucky draw for epic event (about 15 cards in reserve deck and only one that would result with not blowing up generators and I drew it  ). But anyway, in turn 4 or maybe 5 he deployed to hoth system (DS2 wedge in ship and Queens Royal Starship with Corran), I was already set on on the ground so I had to do something with thet to play garrison and dont pay for battle plan. So I deployed Maul in Infiltrator and cloaked. After first garrison Wojciech realized that he will have to do something. So in his last desperate attempt to change something he deployed to hoth, there were two battles I think but they didnt change anything and second garrison ended the game. So I was now at 2 (+19)<br>
The light side: Playing with Lysy is always fun. <br>
The dark side: Not blowing the generators in the first attempt sucked.<br>
<br>
The second game was my LS (what a surprise  ) against Piotr Ptaks DS Combat. I was looking forward for playing with him as he beat my blowing death star up real bad last time and I beat his HB wit a little cheat by 1, so there was once again score to settle and once again revenge was sweet. The fist good thing that happend was the lack of Maul in Piotrs starting handsize, so he just deployed Dr Evazan combo. I deployed X-wing to rendezvous and moved to endor (as always). By the time Maul was at the site I already had the objective flipped. He deployed something in space, but didnt even try to probe, but Battle Order Slowed me a little and my ground package failed me a little. But my win wasnt in danger even for a moment and Ive won by a solid 16, so I was now at 4 (+35)<br>
The light side: Winning of course and my base proving its worth.<br>
The dark side: Partial failure of my ground package.<br>
<br>
Next game was my DS against Sebastian Poplaskis Profit. Sebastian is one of the first SW players in Poland my long time friend and sparing partner, so I knew his deck and he knew mine. I knew that hes using profit with a lot of retriv (harvests, threepio+hopping mad and his stuff) and that helped me win as I knew I had to save my grabber for Harvests. My first turn was typical, Blizzard 4 (with Darth Vader) to Ice Plains, moved to defensive perimeter and draw. Sebastian deployed Lando with Vibro ax and drew, and he didnt free han as he wanted to retrive more after I drained. I was happy with that as I had Maul with stick in hand, but I wasnt able to do anything above sending Lando to lost pile, maul was of course also lost. On my third turn I deployed Imperial walker and moved to defensive perimeter and was ready to blow up on the next turn. Sebastian deployed Lando once again and freed Han, he also provided himself with big activation with Ben at Toshe Station. On the fourth turn my bad luck stroke once again as I drew 1 and didnt blow up generators, which was very bad as I was planning to deploy one malker take Maul into hand and use him to attack Han and Lando, so Bubo had to do, but unfortunately he ate Lando and Profit was still fliped. So Ive lost a few cards to drains and direct damage. But on my 5th turn I finaly fliped my objective by blowing the generators up, that inflicted some serious damage. Like I planed eatlier I deployed a walker to ice plains and took maul into hand, but his primary target had changed as han was now protected by LSJK armed with lukes lightsaber and lightsaber proficiency. So maul went to cantina to have a little chat with checie with Gun and Leia rebel princess and put them out of theyre misery. I also moved one walker to a place that was Main Power generator and I was ready for garrison. On the next turn Ive decidec not to play garrison as Imperial Atrocity was already on table (and I couldnt find control) and besides I didnt want to give Sebastian ability to play Thank The Maker (one harvest was already on the grabber btw). Next two or three tunts were similar I was draining for two and inflicting some direct damage and maul kept making his suicide runs (he must have more lifes than a cat  ). Sebastian used Corran to attack me once on hoth I hink but the attack wasnt very succesful and I finaly played garrison to end the game, Ive won by 17 and was now at 6 (+52)<br>
The light side: Maul and his suicide runs ruled  and kept anoying my opponent.<br>
The dark side: Once again unlucky first shot at the generators.<br>
<br>
Now up to the next game and next chalange for my LS base, this time against Hunt Down by Michal Gajda (Gajwer). I was quite self confident before this game as this deck was build to be a hard matchup for HD, and besides when Im playing with Gajwer Im usualy quite lucky and Ive won most of out previous encounters. The game started typicaly with Michal deploying docking bay and drawing and me deploying x-wing and flying to endor. Then he deployed Blizzard 4 with EPP Vader and I was receving damage from visage. But it wasnt long before my ground package kicked in and HD was refliped and stayed that way for the rest of the game. There was some battling in space during the mid game, and my base was probed quite fast, but that couldnt stoped me from winning for 14, so I was now at 8 (+66).<br>
The light side: Winning against Gajwer yet once again, plus my ground package finaly working as it should.<br>
The dark side: Fast probing. <br>
<br>
The 5th game was once again against Sebastian Poplawski, and now I was playing my LS vs his Watto. Like the last time I knew his deck very well but still I was afraid of this matchup although Ive won the last game I played against it quite easy. Game started as usual watto to junjard and blizzard scout 1 to mos espa, Ive lost two force. Sebastsian played a litte risky leaving Blizzard on mos espa alone, but my starting hand wasnt good enought to make him pay for that, in fack my hand was tragic, I didnt even had x-wing in hand so Ive just drew leaving 2 force for Watto. Second turn he set up stronger on tatooine and drew some. I already had x-wing in hand so I deloyed it and moved to endor, but I still had trouble drawing the rest of my fleet to hand so I was stuck with only one x-wing for the moment, but I had some ground forces and I was ready to put up a fight over mos espa or junkjard so now it was important for me how will the dark side forces be deplyed. After his turn it was something like that: Blizzard 4 and Tempest scout 6 at mos espa, EPP Vader and Blizzard Scout 1 at junjard. By that time I realised that I made one major mistake while putting my deck together, I forgot to put Aim High shield and my plan of sending Watto to used pile and battling Vader wasnt all that good as I didnt want to allow any DS retriv so I deployed and battled at mos espa, the battle ended without any major losses in both sides and now I had to wait for my opponent to make his move, but I was finaly able to draw some of my fleet and I planned to flip on my next turn to keep my opponen with a small hand. On his turn I prefered to lose two rather than allow him to deploy something for free but nevertheless he deployed Zuckuss in ship to space. Unfortunately my fleet wasnt as powerfull as it should be (especialy after canceling Incom Corporation) and I couldnt make Zuckuss pay for all his sins. So at this time we had a status quo at the table, as no further battles took place at mos espa and all I could do in space was scaring zuckus off of space locations so he wouldnt get any drains in space. And drain race began. In the late game it wasnt looking  too good for my as I drew a location in a battle on the ground but I stayed on the site long enough to win, but it was mostly thaks to last battle in space, kiffex to be exact, I left X-wing and Red Leader In red 1 against zuckuss there. Sbastian Iniciated a battle hoping for some retrive from Ability x3, but he forgot about game text of kiffex, plus I had Organized Attack in hand, he drew 4 and had power 8, but I had 12, so he had to choose to lose 4 force ar zuckuss which would result in not satisfing Batle Plan. In the end Ive won by 3 and was now at 10 (+69).<br>
The light side: Winning a very close game, and winning against watto (I hate this deck)<br>
The dark side: Not packing Aim High which couldve cost me the game and maybe even finals.<br>
<br>
Last game was my DS against Marian Zastawnys WYS. By that time I already knew I will be in final so I wasnt to nervous, but once again I had something to prove as Marian had won the last tournament after beating me in the last game. My starting hand was the best in a tournament and one of the best in quite some time, I had Blizzard 4, Tempest 1, Imperial Walker and AT-AT Cannon, so I was almost sure to blow up in the third turn. But when I activated and searched my deck for epic event I realized that there could be some problems with that as I activated Vader, so I changed my plans and isntead of Blizzard 4 I deplyed Tempest 1 with cannon, and I didnt deplyed 3rd marker, it was waiting for Vader so after all i could blow up in the third turn. On his first turn Marian deplyed Phylo to docking bay and moved her to cantina and some ship in space hoping for fast drains. On my second turn I decided it was more important to stop drains then to blow the generators, but still I could try to blow the generators with Tempest 1 alone (my destiny in the deck are quite high so there was a chance) and guess what?? He did it  plus I deplyed Maul with stick to cantina, but here my destinies were a little worse so Phylo was lost with only one or two more cards. But I stoped drains as Marian decided not to pay for Battle Plan, deployed some more in space and moved to Hoth, he also did a very bad thing, he deployed HOTJ which I wasnt yet prepared for. He also tried to put Maul out of play using two out of commisions but maul was lucky and I awarded him by taking him back into hand after deploying walker. So I set up strong on hoth holding all markets and docking bay, so I needed only one more battleground to suspend HOTJ. So on my next turn I deployed maul to cantina and was ready for garrison. Marian knew by this time that destinies in my deck are high so in his turn he deploy LSJK to docking bay to satisfy Battle Plan instead of battling maul in cantina, so on my next turn I played garrison, but it was canceled with T-47 battle formation which I grabbed to be sure my second garrison wont be canceled again, so I deployed walker to take garrison into hand, and maul stayed in cantina for that turn. I was drained for 4 or so but I was ready for that and since nothing came to battle maul I was just waiting for my turn to play garrison, and I did so I made some serious damage and maul began playing cat and mouse with luke. Marian got a few more drains but it was all he could do and Ive won by 24 and finished first with 12 (+93)<br>
The light side: Very easy win.<br>
The dark side: HOTJ making my walkers slowen then they should be.<br/>
<br/>
So now the final confrontation had to decide who will be Polish National Chamion anno domini 2004. Piotr Ptak with 8 (+45) was second so I was preparing to lay my vengence upon him once more  I started with my Ds against his WYS. I wasnt afraind of this game to much, as WYS is quite an easy matchup for my walkers, I starterd typical deploying Blizzard 4 with Vader and moving them to 3rd marker, but Piotrs play wasnt typical as he deployed EPP luke and Tallon to battle me. I just love when people do that, Vader isnt all that important for me and I can play without him, but I love eating  mains with my wampas  But my wampas stayed hungdy this time as Luke didnt hit Vader and Piotr drew 1 for destiny, I drew 6 so he forfeited everything leaving Vader on 3rd marker. At this moment Piotr had already lost this game on the psychological level and it was just a matter of time befere he would lost on all other levels. I decided not to drain, because Lost In The Wilderness would be anyoing, so I deployed Tempest 1 with cannon and move to Vader and vader came aboard as a pilot. Piotr wasnt making any more attempts to battle on Hoth and deployed in space. So Ive blown the generators without problems and start my preparations for garrison, he didnt interfere with my plans in any way so the game was quickly over and Ive won by 22.<br/>
The light side: The first battle of the game  and an easy win.<br/>
The dark side: I think there was no dark side in this game.<br/>
<br/>
In the second game Piotr (I was playing against DS combat once again) had much better start as he deployed maul and his double saber and start draining me for 4. He drained me 3 times before I was able to flip. By that time I was set us in space as well as on ground (he couldnt do anything to my ground forces) but I already had like 15-18 force in my lost pile and he had like maybe 6 or something, so I had to start draining fast if I wanted to win, and I did thanks to kessel, kifex and coruscant. There was only one battle during the whole game as he finaly deployed Zuckuss in ship to coruscant to battle my lone X-wing but I deployed spiral for eract and forfeited it in battle, but my x-wing stayed and if Piotr wanted to win he had to start probing, so he left coruscant. So for two turns I was draining him for about 8-9 and he was draining me for 2. But after two turns he probed and it was pure drain race from now on, but nothining interested happened as I wasnt able to battle Zuckuss, Ive just kept scarring him of from systems.  So now he was draining me for 6 and I kept my pace with 8-9. In the end it was very close, but Ive won by 3, and thats how Ive became bach-to-back Polish National Champion <br/>
The light side: My LS unbeaten in a tournament which didnt happen in last 3 or 4 tournaments.<br/>
The dark side: Close game against a deck which should be an easy matchup.<br/>
<br/>
So that would be all I guess but before I finish this crappy TR I must thak some people as usual, so here it is:<br/>
