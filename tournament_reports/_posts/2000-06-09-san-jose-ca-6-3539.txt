<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Its been awhile but Im back to SW.......The bad part about L5R is that it doesnt have too many tournaments. This tournament is being held at Comics and Fantasies in San Jose, on Saturday, June 3rd. Happy reading.....<br>
<br>
<br>
I wasnt sure if I was going to make the tournament or not the night before, as I waited for my friend Steven Lee to call. I was supposed to head up there for a Trek tournament early, and stick around for the SW one later on. He called around 12 at night, letting me know he'll bee here arond 1030 the next morning......great. <br>
<br>
I havent touched my SW decks in awhile, but I was confident in them. The other thing was I had to make a Trek deck before tomorrow so I wouldnt need to sit there for 4 hours until the SW tourney started. After a little searching on Decipher, I came up with a Borg deck, and passed out right after. I woke Steve up the next morning, drove down to the tourney, and placed 4th in the Trek tourney, which wasnt too bad. 9 people showed for Star Wars, including Matt Smith, a normal sanctioned tourney as always. <br>
<br>
My decks.......Speed Profit for Light.........Raltiir Ops for Dark........same basic story as everyone else....got to hang with what works.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS Raltiir Ops vs. Some Jabroni's LS MWYHL Train to 5<br>
<br>
I start Bad Feelings instead of Arrest Order this game, he starts Wise Advice. I get a good starting hand, with two twix sites and Kashyyyk. I set up on Raltiir, he sets up on Dagobah but hes slowed by Bad Feelings. I get Raltiir flipped by 3rd turn, he's still tying to get DOS out. I drain, he trains, I drain, he trains. He starts to build up force for a few turns so Im expecting hit squad but Im not too worried.....he eventually tries to drop EPP Luke and Obi at the Forest against Mara. He battles, I react 2 walkers over.....kill off Luke. He kills off Mara and an AT-ST pilot. My turn, I repilot the walker, and set up Decree, and let Obi sit. He does nothing but draw for a few turns, so I send Ozzel and DS-61-2 on Bossk and land them at Dagobah.  DOS and Yoda migrates over, I start populating Dagobah. I drop Vader move to Yoda's Hut to secure my drain, he comes over and battles. I kill off DOS, he kills off DS, Yoda runs away. For the rest of the game, he makes pointless assualts on Raltiir and I drain him out. Win by 24.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+24)<br>
Highs: Raltiir strikes again....<br>
Lows: Nothing much.....why do people bother with MWYHL?<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: DS Raltiir Ops vs. Alex Stepanko's LS Profit Rip-Off<br>
<br>
His Profit starts exactly as mines, I cant help but think he took that idea from me. Hmm....General Solo.....Insurrection....anyways, he flips 3rd turn, I flip 4th. He sits and drains, I set up Decree, and its pretty much over. All thats hurting me is Profit now. He sends Lando and Tawss Khaa over to Raltiir, kills off Arnet but leaves Ozzel, I cant draw because of Scramble since theres no walker there. Next turn, I come back with DLOTS to back up Ozzel, choke Tawss, smack Lando for 9 more.For the rest of the game, he sits, does Profit damage, I drain, and in the end I edge him out by 11.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+35)<br>
Highs: Ral Ops strikes again.....<br>
Lows: Nothing much<br>
<br>
I figured there was something not right about me playing DS twice in the first round, turns out the TD made an error, which screwed up more than my game. Alex went nuts, saying how he couldve done better with his dark,yet no one believed him, and we all ignored the piece of monkeycrap and started the 3rd game.<br>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS Speed Profit vs. Steve Daniels DS Alien Scum Beatdown<br/>
<br/>
He starts off looking like Anti-Profit.....with the Tatooine system and JP to start the game. He converts my AC the first turn, and I get the crappiest hand to boot. I draw, find Ben, his saber, and Luke, so Im okay. He started Jabba and Ephant Mon at the AC, dropped Boelo on his second turn. I drop Mos Eisley for more activation, he drops Mara there for drains. I come down with Ben, saber, and Luke at the AC with Lightsaber Prof and battle. I miss the pop on Boelo, but I slice Jabba and we equal in power. His turn, he drops EPP Fett, ECC Iggy, Lyn Me, and a Rodian and battles. He misses the capture on Luke, but plays Jabbas Through With You. I pop Fett, slice Boelo, he draws double destiny to kill off Ben, leaving Luke. My turn I look at the situation.....He has IG-88, Lyn Me, Ephant Mon, and the Rodian vs. Luke. Hmmm.....I can make it so he has no destiny, so I drop EPP Leia, and Anakin's saber, battle......play Skywalkers in case IG gets lucky and nabs Luke. He targets Luke, misses. I pop Ephant Mon, no more destiny. I shoot Lyn Me....hit. Slice the Rodian....hit. I free Han with Someone Who Loves You, now Leia adds one too. I draw a 1..another 1, another 1, and finally a 5. Great....well I manage to clear the site and get through lots of damage, another suicide run with EPP Fett and thats game. Win by 31. <br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 6(+66)<br/>
Highs: Profit strikes again.......<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS Speed Profit vs. Matt Smiths DS Hunt Down All-Around<br/>
<br/>
He starts Mara and Dannik at the AC. First turn, he moves them out to JP for drains. I drop Luke, Ben, and saber to the AC, free Han second turn. He drops OG Vader, saber, and Maras saber, upping his drains to 4. I Signal for Lightsaber Prof, find Anakins saber for a drain of 4 myself plus Profit damage. We sit and drain a majority of the game, until he Alters Lightsaber Prof to even out the odds. He eventually drops the 3rd Marker with Jabba there. I drop EPP Leia, battle, both die off. He drops Tempest 1, I drop Orrimaarko.....pull a 1 for destiny. Ok....Ouch time, Im thinking.....next turn, he plays Elis......but ONLY to move Tarkin there. I battle, kill off Tarkin and make him lose 2 more. He drops EPP Fett, battles, hits Orrimaarko, but draws low destiny so Im only losing 3 more. I let Fett have it, and finally draw Boushh. I drop her to JP next turn, prompting him to go inside. I Sorry About the Mess Vader.....5,5......hit and gone. Only Mara and Dannik left. I battle, pop Dannik. He slices at Han.....1,2.....ouch. I need to hit Mara, and draw a 0 for the first destiny, but its followed by a 7 for the second. YES! Hit, forfeit 0. He cant believe it.......he pulls a 1 for destiny to boot, I pull a 5 to finish him off. Win by 10.<br/>
<br/>
Cumulative Score: 8(+76)<br/>
Highs: A fun, challenging game with Matt<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish the day undefeated and take the tourney. Matt wants revenge and we play again, and I end up killing all his Vaders and he folds. We get the new CC prize support again, and once again, I pull Boba Fett, in addition to a LS Lando as well. I trade Fett for a Capt. Han, which will probably find more use with me than another Fett will. All in all a fun day was had, a nice relaxing tourney passed. Until next time.....<br/>
