Hello All!!<br>
<br>
   Well, my last tournament was as a director so I was really looking forward to get back to the player's side. So this weekend I travel up the road known as I-10 and headed for a couple of Phoenix tournaments. I wish I could have gotten there sooner on Friday and made it to all 3 tournaments this weekend, but what can you do about it? So after a good night's rest I was really to play.<br>
<br>
   Mike Girard was running this morning's tournament. The site was AZ Games, which is always a pleasure to play at. They've got plenty of space, and cards available for purchase. So as the Pokemon tournament finished up, we were just starting.<br>
<br>
LS Deck - 'Playing CC Sabacc for a Profit'<br>
DS Deck - 'Dreaded Rumors'<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs. Patrick Gimber's TDIGWATT Deck<br>
<br>
   Patrick is also from Tucson. You travel 100 miles to play someone you could have played if you stayed home. Don't you just hate that? Oh well, it could be worse I guess. Patrick's a good player that's beaten me the last time we played. I'll have to be careful in this game.<br>
<br>
   He started with the Casino and Imperial Arrest Order. He also deployed Mara Jade and Boba Fett with Blaster Rifle to the Audience Chamber. I started with Uh oh! and the game was one. From the start, I felt the only thing that can hurt me is the space drains. This deck has plenty of ground, but no space.<br>
<br>
   First turn he deploys a Cloud City site, Cloud City and Bespin. My first turn I search for Bo Shuda, and can't find it. So he's able to go through me deck and see what surprises I have for him. I guess, it's a sure bet he knows I don't have space and that I'm actually playing sabacc on Cloud City too. So I draw up and get my Bo Shuda. I guess he was looking for a site, because he didn't deploy anything next turn. Which was fine by me. I have plenty of Force to start dropping my characters. Tessek and Bo Shuda to the Audience Chamber, Elom to one site, and a Devorian to another. He drops a few characters to battle, but I use Path of Least Resistance to move away. I'm draining on Cloud City, and every thing is going well. I got Order to Engage out, and he leaves the Audience Chamber. I try to Lost in the Wilderness the drain at Jabba's Palace, but I drew a sight instead. Lando and Boushh make their appearance on cloud city as well now. He set up Dark Deal and Cloud City Occupation, but there's enough sites that I know I can cancel Dark Deal next turn. I've saved enough Force, and I release Han. Unfortunately, because I did it right after my activate phase, I forgot my control phase and missed 2 drains, and Lando and Leia at battlegrounds for the Profit game text. (Mistake #1 of the day.) Next turn, he deploys a bunch, and beats up on Lando and the 2 Eloms with him. Slowly, my Cloud City forces start to disappear. I never really get enough to get back at him. Full lose by 8.   0 (-8)<br>
<br>
Highlight - Seeing that the Cloud City draining can work.<br>
Lowlight  - Skipping a control phase at an important time of the game.<br>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs. Brandon Allen's 'Girard's Beats' Deck<br/>
<br/>
   Since Mike was directing the tournament, Brandon was using his decks to play. I've faced Mike's deck before is my 'Dreaded Rumors' deck, and the results weren't very good. My only saving grace is that it appears I know his deck better than he does. He asks, but Mike refuses to tell him which effect to start with. So he only starts with Hidden Base and Rendezvous Point. I start with Endor Operations and Oppressive Enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
   I draw Ominous Rumors in my hand so I deploy it and draw up. He gets out Dagobah, and Yoda's Hut. Pretty soon he has a Bothan Spy, Obi w/ LS, and Leia w/ BR at my Bunker. So now that I know where they are, I use Tactical Support and get my 3 Biker Scouts (Irol, Elsek, and Drelosyn).  Next turn I've got Zuckuss in Mist Hunter at Kashyyyk, Tempest 1 with my 3 Scout at the Landing Pad and I feel good about myself. Han joins the group at the Bunker, and I get a Boba Fett in Slave 1 to Endor. Luke w/ LS and Wedge take on my Tempest 1, but my 2 destinies and immunity &lt; 4 is too much for Wedge to handle and he pulls out. But then he moves everyone from the Bunker out to help Luke. I run every one into the Bunker and continue my drains in space. I Ghhhk the battle against my Tempest 1 and deploy U-3PO next turn. Eventually he loads everyone into Tantative IV, but I'm able to avoid the battles and continue my drains in space. My mistake for this game was draining with 3 Biker Scout and getting a Surprise Assault played against me. But that wasn't my biggest mistake. Not playing the catch card before canceling it with Tarkin's Orders was a bigger mistake. But that wasn't my biggest mistake. My biggest mistake was letting him play a second one without checking to see if he even had Force to pay. (That and forgetting to add my power for the resulting damage.) That one little sequence cost me 14 Force. Full win by 11.   2 (+3)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight - Winning against a deck that beat me before.<br/>
Lowlight - How poorly I played that Surprise Assault. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs. Patrick Gimber's HB X-wing Swarm Deck<br/>
<br/>
   Well, if travelling 100 miles to play someone from my own town was bad, playing him twice is worse. But that's okay. I know it's going to be a good game, and frankly, I'd like to get a chance to get back for him beating me earlier. He starts with S-foils, and I start with Oppressive Enforcement. I was expecting to see a lot of X-wings, but I decided to go with this instead of Imperial Arrest Order.<br/>
<br/>
   This game I'm getting a lot of Force from all the systems he's pulling out, and I'm able to get some of mine too. I use Tactical Support to grab my 3 Bikers again and I deploy them to the Bunker. Next I get a Dreadnaught with DS-61-2 and DS-61-4 to Kiffex. He deploys Lando in Falcon, and Red Leader in Red 1. Fortunately I draw a 6 and only lose Dash-4 to attrition. (IAO was out.) He drew a 5, and forfeited Lando. Next turn I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, and draw another 6. So things are starting off well. He flips his objective so I'm not draining for much. Next turn he deploys another Falcon but with Han Solo this time and starts a Kessel Run from Tibrin. So I move my ships to Tibrin and wait for his glorious return to help celebrate a successful Kessel Run. He add Luke Skywalker and returns. I drop the big hurt in the name of Boosk in Hound Tooth, another Dreadnaught, Capt. Lennox, First Strike, and Lateral Damage. Power was 31 to 4, and he couldn't return after that fight. Full win by 18.   4 (+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight - No mistakes this game, battling with a deck that's made for draining.<br/>
Lowlight - Playing a Tucson player again by game 3.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs. Don Anzoloine's 'Anti-profit' Deck<br/>
<br/>
   Time to see if I can get as good a game as I did last time with this deck. He starts Mos Eisley, and Combat Readiness for Jabba's Palace. He also started with Mara Jade and Boelo in the Audience Chamber. I started Uh oh!. I was not liking the looks of this at all!<br/>
<br/>
   Well, he searches and converts my Audience Chamber. My only chance of getting this game back under control is to find my Bo Shuda quickly. Needless to say he had Mara Jade and LS at Mos Eisley, Vader and Tarker at the Lars' Moisture Farm, before I ever found my Bo Shuda. Vader and Tarkin use Elis to beat up on 2 Eloms at Cloud City. I got Master Luke and Obi w/ LS to battle Jabba the Hutt but missed on the lightsaber. I lose Obi, we loses Jabba. Boelo and Jabba come down again to get Master Luke at Jabba's Palace.  Lando frees Han only to forget to retrieve my 10 Force and get captured later by IG-88 w/ RG. Full loss by 36.    4 (-15)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight - Making Mara Jade Lost in the Wilderness of Mos Eilsey<br/>
Lowlight - Getting beat like a rented mule.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
DS vs. Stephen Smith's DBO Deck<br/>
<br/>
   Right now I'm feeling lucky that this tournament is 6 games and not 4. I'm a little bummed with how poorly I'm playing and the mistakes I'm making with my cards. My only silver lining is that I still have a chance to place well in this tournament, and my DS deck is 2-0.<br/>
<br/>
   Steven starts with Dantooine and Goo Nee Tay. I start Endor Operations and Oppressive Enforcement. I draw Kessel and Boosk in Hound's Tooth in my opening hand so I deploy Ominous Rumors and leave some Force. He deploys the Farm, and a Rebel Guard or two. I didn't plan on sending a battle Force to Dantooine because of how content I was with my space drains. I quickly deploy Bossk in Hound's Tooth and more to Dantooine. That was pretty much game. It looked like he only had Rebel Guards and a few main in the deck. He was draining for 3, I was draining for 7. Eventually, I saved some Force and deployed DV,DLOTS along with Tempest Scout 6 to beat up on some guards and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk. That was the only interaction of the game. Full Win by 14.   6 (-1)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight - No mistakes, and my 'Dreaded Rumors' Deck going 3-0 here in Phoenix.<br/>
Lowlight - Not a lot of interaction in this game and still having a negative differential.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
LS vs. Daniel Collins TDIGWATT Deck<br/>
<br/>
   I got a chance for a little revenge against the person that beat my LS deck earlier today. Now's the chance to get revenge against the deck type. He started with the Casino and used Any Means Necessary to get the Security Tower, Boba Fett, and Slave I. He also deployed Mara Jade and M'iiyoom Onith to the Audience Chamber. Since he didn't have a lot of Force coming his way, I went with Uh Oh! instead of  Goo Nee Tay.<br/>
<br/>
   Get got out the Prison, Cloud City and Bespin, but wasn't getting any starships. I pulled out Bo Shuda and Order to Engage. I really should consider playing with a Worrt in this deck. So he take a couple of OTE Force loses before he moves away. Already I have Eloms and Devorians on Cloud City. My drains are hitting him hard and he never really gets set up. I even won some games of Sabacc to get Force back. In the end I had a Full Win by 25.   8 (+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highlight - Finally winning with my LS deck.<br/>
Lowlight - Going 1-2 with my LS deck.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
   All in all I had a great time. I ended up winning a Salacious Crumb foil and pulling a Princess Leia one from my Prize Support. I was also able to trade for some nice Japanese cards and other foils. Mike Girard ran a great tournament. Thanks to all that participated.<br/>
