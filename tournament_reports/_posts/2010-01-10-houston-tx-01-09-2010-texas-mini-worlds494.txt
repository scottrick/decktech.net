<br>
My first game of SWCCG was 11 years ago.  My most recent game of SWCCG was right after virtual set 9 was released.  In one of my last SWCCG tournaments, I beat a guy by playing Elis Helrot to transport Mighty Jabba (V) and a horde of aliens to win the game in the first five turns with a 90+ power beatdown.  After that, I sold my cards and decided I didnt want to play anymore.<br>
<br>
So imagine my surprise when Texas player Michael Richards e-mailed me asking if I wanted to attend Texas Mini-Worlds.  In the back of my mind, I thought it would be cool to see all of my old card-playing friends, so I told him I would come, but only as an observer, not a player.  The next day, Mike called me and told me that I needed to play.  I explained to him that I had no cards, no idea of what was good, no idea what the most recent virtual sets had introduced . . . he told me not to worry about it.  Itll come back quick, he said.<br>
<br>
I get online and look at the most recent virtual sets, expecting Ill have to read through a few.  What I find instead is a 67-page PDF in which there are 10 new sets, and many of the cards I was around for have been changed.  I call up Mike again and say Theres no way I can learn all of these.  I used to play WYS raiders and Dark Deal all the time - can I still use those.  Im told WYS raiders is still okay, but that Dark Deal isnt.  So I ask about a simple, dark side mains deck.  Mike says thats a good idea, and says he will build decks for me.<br>
<br>
So Friday night I make the five hour drive to Houston, and meet up with Mike and the other players when they are on the last round of a team tournament.  In addition to Mike, there are many people I recognize (and many more I dont).  Nick Reisch is there, and so is the infamous Thomas Whaley.  So is Scott Lingrell, who I have spoken to on the phone but never met in real life.  Im also introduced to guys I only know through Decktech: Greg falloutboy Shaw, Bill TacoBill Kafer, Chris imhrail Schoenthal, plus some guys I dont know at all but whose names sound familar: Kevin Shannon, who apparently won worlds recently, and Aaron Nelsen, who designed a virtual card that everyone seems to hate.<br>
 At the end of the team tournament we head over to Chilis for a few beers, and its like the last five years happened in a day.  Were talking tech - which mostly consists of me saying things like Is that a new card? or What does that do? - but its fun.  Everyone seems to think dark side is terrible (I ask Mike Whats good for dark now? and everyone answers: Nothing!), and that some of the new cards are overpowered.  I would like to be just as irate as them but I have no idea what the new cards are!<br>
<br>
Five of us head back to Mikes house - me, Scott, Greg, TacoBill (people seriously call him this) and a guy Ive never met, Winston.  Sorry, I dont know last names of most people (including those you will read in the game reports below).  I am up until almost five oclock in the morning looking at decks, trying to remember phases, rules, and a few new cards.  I flip through the WYS deck Mike has built for me, read the virtual cards Ive never seen, draw one or two opening hands with it just so I can remember things like where to deploy and how to set up.  Then I play the dark mains deck he built me against the WYS he built me, and get creamed.  Your deck is pretty weak to raiders, Mike says, But you should beat regular WYS.  I ask him what else I will be weak to, and he basically says If your opponent is using light side cards, youre at a disadvantage.  Apparently, dark side is quite awful at the moment.<br>
<br>
I sleep for about four hours on Mikes air mattress, then get up and we head back to Skirmish Games, the site of the tournament.  There are 24 players in attendance, and the tournament is 8 games long.  I know I wont be able to stay for all 8 if I hope to get home at a decent hour, so I decide I will leave no later than 7:00 no matter how many games I have played.<br>
<br>
Game 1 - Light Side vs. Olaf<br>
<br>
Olaf is playing Bring Him Before Me.  I think I remember how the objective works, but just to be sure I read it again.  I read over all the text, but I only remember the important part: I get to have Luke on the table all game, even if I lose him.  Olaf starts off by deploying Emperor Palpatine with The Emperors Power at the Throne Room and then puts out the Death Star II Docking Bay and draws.  I decide not to put Luke in space for when Vader comes around, but luckily I have a couple of ships in my opening hand so I start setting up in space.  Olaf deploys the Endor Docking Bay and the Endor Back Door, and puts a character (Maul, I think) at one of my Tatooine locations.  On my turn I set up some more at Tatooine and then spread to Kessel.  Mike told me before the tournament that dark side can only afford to play in one theatre these days, so if I see a ground force it means they have little (if any) space.  I leave one ship, Dash Rendar, at Tatooine and move virtual Han Solo in Millenium Falcon to Kessel.  Olaf draws a few on his turn, and on my turn I pay three to drain at Kessel.  When I do, Olaf loses some cards off the top, including a Maul and a Vader.  I play an Out of Commission combo and manage to place Vader out of play.  Confident now, I set up some palace raiders in patrol crafts on my docking bays, but Olaf responds by deploying a droid tank with a droid pilot and a cannon on the tank.  I have to read these cards because when I was playing last, they sucked, but now maybe theyre good?  I read about my vehicles being targeted at +3 and get a sinking feeling, so I move my patrol craft away from his tank.  What I didnt pay attention to was the card Open Fire, that lets Olaf shoot my craft at the adjacent site anyway, so raider and craft go lost.  He then puts another tank with a cannon on Tatooine, and with Open Fire he can effectively shoot any of my patrol crafts on Tatooine.  So instead I set up on the Endor Docking Bay, avoiding the Back Door so that Olaf cant transport to that docking bay with a tank and then shoot at my at the Back Door.  Olaf stays on Tatooine with his tanks, but starts dropping characters to fight me at the Endor Docking Bay.  He has first strike out, so every time he battles I lose a force, but because I can keep deploying Luke from the lost pile with his objective I am always able to maintain presence at the site, satisfying Battle Plan and Search and Destroy.  After a few fights at the back door my space drains wear Olaf down and I win by 11.<br>
<br>
Game 2 - Dark vs. Aaron Nelsen<br>
<br>
I only know his last name because I was told hes the BoShek guy.  He is playing Hidden Base, but apparently theres a virtual hidden base now.  I read his objective and one of his starting effects that seems to have a lot of gametext on it (dont remember the name).  I set up Sidious at the Coruscant site and start drawing for characters.  And drawing.  And drawing.  And at the end of my second turn I have like 16 cards in my hand but still no characters.  Or starships.  Which is weird because I thought I had a bunch in there.  Anyway, Aaron is playing lots of virtual cards.  Most of his locations are even virtual, so I have to read all of those.  He deploys some kind of virtual Luke that is power 5 that Ive never seen before, and his gametext seems really good.  Early in the game Aaron has Luke, Leia Rebel Princess, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon at one location.  They all have sabers, and in the mix are cards like Mercenary Armor, Lightsaber Proficiency, Obi-Wans Journal, stuff like that.  Hes draining for I think five or six at that one location, and I cant play Resistance because I dont occupy more than the one battleground Sidious is at.  Finally I draw into some characters, and deploy Maul, Vader, Tarkin, P-59 and Dr. Evazan to his location.  My intention is to play Disarmed on one of his characters, but I forgot that one of those cards - Merc Armor? - makes it to where I cant play Disarmed.  We battle and Darth Vader chokes Leia, but apparently he has some card that says Anyone with a lightsaber can cancel a weapon destiny, so I cant hit any of his guys.  He plays Sorry About the Mess to get rid of Tarkin, then hits my other guys and when the smoke clears I have lost all of my characters and he has lost Leia, Rebel Princess and thats it.  Now I have no characters, so I just draw up.  Kind of frustrating that I had the horde of characters and wasnt able to really do anything to him, but I guess thats what I get for not knowing how to play against his deck.  I still have no idea what that objective is supposed to do.  Anyway, I think I lost by about 20.<br>
<br/>
Game 3 - Dark vs. Matt<br/>
<br/>
Matt is playing WYS, and he sets up heavy in space while I put Sidious at his site.  I draw up into some characters, Maul and Dr. Evazan and P-59, maybe one more, and I put them all at the Cantina because an early verification showed me that hes playing some kind of beatdown deck.  On his turn he deploys a smuggler to two different sites, deploys Tatooine Celebration, then consolidates the two smugglers to the same location.  On my turn I Elis Helrot to that site, hit a smuggler and make him immediately lost (some kind of Heroic smuggler, which apparently means I have to target him, so I couldnt target Wedge).  Maul hits Wedge with his saber, and Matt loses Wedge and every card left in his reserve deck (I played First Strike and he didnt save a force for Houjix).  I won by 28 or 29.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - Light vs. Taco Bill<br/>
<br/>
Taco is playing another virtual objective, Hunt Down I think.  The objective is actually pretty cool, I think. He puts a new character (Galen?) so the Naboo site that makes my guys go used when he hits them if they arent ability &gt; 4.  I dont think I have any characters in my deck that are ability &gt; 4, so that site is safe.  I set up Menace Fades in a hurry, because I think Galens lightsaber adds to drain, but it doesnt.  This game was pretty short, because Taco Bill played some kind of effect that lets him take a card into hand to limit me to one destiny.  Dont remember the name, but the gametext might as well say WYS looks dumb, because thats what it really did.  I get beat down off of my locations, except in space because Bill didnt even deploy a starship the whole game.  Anyway, I lose by 29 but then dont draw up so he can retrieve his whole lost pile and I can play someone with a bad differential.  I think he only had 9 cards in lost, though, so I lose by almost 40.  Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - Light vs. Matt<br/>
<br/>
Same guy from game 3.  Hes playing Hunt Down, but its regular non-virtual Hunt Down.  He plays some interrupt to get Vader from reserve (cant believe such an interrupt exists, actually) and puts Vader in the Cantina.  I set up in space, and on his second turn he deploys Maul to the back door.  I play Kessel so I can move Luke over there, but I forgot that Hunt Down says Luke cant drain.  Wow, Im rusty.  I Terminate Visage, but it doesnt do me much good because as soon as I deploy the ground a Mara Jade persona (virtual) beats me up, as does Galen.  I end up losing by about 20.<br/>
<br/>
So at this point I have to drop from the tournament because I have five hours to drive to get home, and if I leave any later I wont get home until the middle of the night.  I guess Im getting old - I am no longer comfortable driving after midnight, especially on only four hours of sleep.  I say goodbye to Mike and Nick, then sneak out of the store so I dont have to tell anyone else that Im leaving and have them try to persuade me to stay late so theres no bye.  Its a long, slow drive home, but on the way I start thinking about the game now vs. the game when I used to play.<br/>
<br/>
Playing wasnt as much fun as I thought it would be.  Oh, I still had a great time, but it wasnt the same.  I guess the part I enjoy now is hanging out with friends.  Building decks was fun, talking tech with players was fun, but actually sitting down and playing the game was . . . different.  I guess because Im not as competitive as I was back then.  Maybe Ive gotten too used to playing chess, where you dont have to worry about anything except the other player being smarter than you.  In SWCCG, Ive been gone so long I dont know or remember what most of the cards do.  I wouldnt say the game is bad, its just not for me anymore.  It was a nice trip down memory lane, but I cant say Im sorry I sold my cards and quit playing.  I think it would be nice to play pickup games every now and then, but only as a way to socialize - the desire to win or be the best just isnt there anymore.  Maybe one tournament a year, for old times sake, is enough for this old man.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts on the state of the game, based on one tournament in years:<br/>
The decks seem more fair than they did when I last played.  I used the previously mentioned MKOS beats and WYS (V) at my last tournament, and they seemed ridiculously unfair.  I didnt play against any decks at this tournament that I thought were unfair - I just didnt know what any of the cards did.  It seems like there are some good ways to play with light and dark jedi, which seems like fun.  If I had it to do over again, I would play a light side jedi deck with Home One for space, now that theres an Imperial Command for light side (so cool).  For dark I might play the new Hunt Down objective - the 7-side has some good bonuses, and it just seems like fun.  I think I didnt see the darker side of SWCCG - the Ewok beatdowns that people said were a problem, and all of the anti-EPP and maintenance cards, which people say have contributed to the struggles of dark side.  From what I saw, the game looks like there are a lot of fun deck options.  Take that for what you will - I have almost no experience in the current meta and Im sure I didnt see anywhere close to all of the new virtual cards.  However, for one day out of the year . . . it was a fun experience, and given the chance Id do it again.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Michael Richards, for running the tournament, letting me stay at his house, building my decks for me . . . youre the best.<br/>
Mrs. Michael Richards, for giving all of us a comfortable place to sleep and what I can only describe as the mother of continental breakfasts in the morning.<br/>
Matt - sorry I dont remember your last name - for being the only other smoker at the tournament, so I had company.<br/>
TacoBill - you seem like a cool guy, even if you are a little obsessed with football.<br/>
Greg Shaw, for being a Philadelphia Eagles fan, like me.  Not that its a great time to be a Philly fan.<br/>
Scott Lingrell, for being such a nice guy, and for winning the best-dressed contest at the tournament, despite the fact that TacoBill wore a tie.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Scott Lingrell, for making me sleep on an air mattress because he refused to spoon with me in Mikes spare bed.  My feelings are still hurt.<br/>
Me - for being gone from the game so long that I have no idea whats going on. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
