<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Yeah, this is now day 2. All you waited for. I really cant believe words like I assume it is Angelo otherwise Nico would have bragged about it on all existing forums. ... Am I that princess :D? Well, might be :) <br>
But hey, no, not really, or? Waahhh.. However, I think I know how you mean it.<br>
<br>
Tamas made the bracket for the first European MPC, what we called CMPC, so my first game was a bye (I was seeded as first, thanks for your confidence). For informations check here: http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=15832.<br>
So what was so important to play at this MPC? There was a V-card card for the winning player and a glass and and and... glory! All we fight for was glory.<br>
I was really under pressure, because Mr. Van Beurden didnt show up so I was treated like the one, who is an aspirant for the first place. My summer was awful and after Europeans, I didnt play anything except the prealease V14 tournament (I am sorry, but I cant report from it, I only know that some won it... uhh.. it was me, but that didnt really count... I was lucky that tournament). I even didnt playtested anything or built new decks. I came back to the game 2 weeks ago, but didnt tested new decks. So everyone was suspecting me playing my LS Combat Kart and a RallOps for DS, because I played them at Europeans and some others events. Nobody really cares, that I am a bad LSC player... really!<br>
However, I built an DS Combat Kart a day before friday and playtested it with Tamas and NO, it doesnt work in our meta. It just doesnt work. Sorry Darren, I really like it and wanted to play it, but it didnt work. It just didnt work... it works for LS, but not for DS.<br>
<br>
Okay, after I picked up Tamas at the Frankfurt main station and gave some place for some players that they dont need to pay for a hotel, I was TD at day 1, what I already posted.<br>
<br>
So here we go:<br>
My decks: I played my LS Combat Kart with one card different then Europeans and for DS I first choosed of course RallOps, but I didnt want to play it. I talked some to Dirk Friedrichs who played Fear day 1 and playtested it to realise, that it plays like a guter Schiss. Actually, I really dont want to translate this, but it means, that Fear can be played without thinking a lot, means not tracking 14 cards like I have to in RallOps and then forget them all, because I search for a card. I cant go into detail for that deck, because it is not my deck. I know, that there are some decks that use Attack Run from under the side deck, even if the deck doesnt has anything to do with it, but I was prepared for that imho =)<br>
<br>
Round 1: like I already said: bye<br>
<br>
Round 2 against Andreas Holtmann<br>
<br>
Game 3: my FEAR vs his Jedi Tours On Coruscant <br>
I choosed to go with dark first, because I know that his dark deck is the best Watto out there and that I dont even have a minimal chance to win that game, so I tried to win by the first and minimize my second loss afterwards.<br>
Andreas startet Carefull Planning(v) with some Coruscant stuff. In my first turn I was able to cover his Coruscant, but he had the Jedi Council Chamber out in his first turn, so I didnt had any advantage of it. I set up my FEAR (in german it is said like vier, which means 4) damage of 4 funny note, FEAR = vier = 4. However, He deployed Home One and Bright Hope(v) to my Coruscant system. I deployed alot ships there and Lateral Damage to kill him with an overflow from about 8. He didnt forfeit Home One and lost cards, but came back with Admiral Ackbar and Artoo, Brave Little Droid to cancel the Lateral Damage. I still got some ships in hand, beated him there again and spread to do more damage with fear and that admiral, that adds to force drains. <br>

<br>
Game 4: my LS Combat Kart vs his incredible, 6-0 in 2 days Watto<br>
Both decks did the normal set up: Yoda at Naboo, his early damage on Tatooine.<br>
After I won the race, I tried to invade his planet with some Mace and Obi Well, he shots Obi lost, he played all the exhaust that he said I shouldnt tell on the TR, so all I say is: react, react, react. I really should pack in some Senses in that LS deck. He overpowered my Jedi with easy on Tatooine, so I lost one battle by 7 and one by 9. After he set up Tatooine Occupation and Were in Attack Position Now with 2 Commanders, I just did my force drains on Naboo and did some mathematics I could bring him down to 12 which means that I am in round 3 <br>

<br/>
Good: <br/>
- Andreas DS deck is insane. <br/>
- fair opponent<br/>
- funny talks between the actions (like the blond girl near to our table...)<br/>
<br/>
Not so good:<br/>
- Andreas mistake during the first game<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Semi-Final against Chris Menzel<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: my FEAR vs his Senate<br/>
I choosed DS, because I knew he plays Senate and I knew that I can propably beat this. Thanks to Imperial Justice(v), which I started, I could have made that game to me. I did the Merriek stuff and he deployed Corran Horn first turn, that I dont get my systems. Luckyily I drew 2 of them to set up a fear damage. After he drew a hand of 13 I Monnok all his good stuff in his used pile. He actually tried to come to space, but the Imperial navy was just to strong. The force drain damage was on my side.<br/>
FW by +19<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: my LS Combat Kart vs his Senate<br/>
Again Senate! Oh my god... I hate him for playing LS AND DS Senate. He set up Lott Dott and another to flip first turn and triggered Thrown Back(v) to get the Senate Hovercam, where I drew Mace(v). I deployed Mace into the Senate, played Smoke Screen and got rid of all the three cards (the 2 Senators and his Hovercam) and lost Mace, which was his advice to do so. I finished my race, retrieved some, drained a lot and won.<br/>
FW by +37<br/>
<br/>
Good: <br/>
- making me again a nightmare to Chris<br/>
- Chris giving me advice during the game, to let Mace die. However, I drew a Houjix in the same turn!<br/>
- Me for making no mistake<br/>
<br/>
Not so good:<br/>
- Chris, loosing against again me. I am really sorry, actually you deserved a victory more then me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Final against Angelo Consoli<br/>
Angelo was 2nd at Europeans and gave me the title. I thought about doing the same, but I had alot more differential then he has. However, this time, we played it... the little pimp against an ex world champion...<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: my FEAR vs his QMC<br/>
I dont know why I choosed FEAR. I dont know. Normally its the better matchup for him, but I discussed with Dirk what to start and I thought, that he could play better with his dark. However, I deployed 3 systems during my first turn to get some activition. He deployed a CC site and Kybec (first non-v, then v..., I will remember this ;), just kidding) and Princess Leia(v) to another site. I deployed another System with Merriek and drew some and set up an Fear damage of 2. He flipped with Outrider and Luke Skywalker(v) in that 0-7 destiny ship. I  searched for an effect with WMAOP (I dont remember what it was), but it wasnt in my reserve, so I took Lateral Damage and tried my risk. Deployed 4 Star Destroyers and Lateral Damage on Outrider for an overflow of 13 cards + Luke + ship + Dash. Outrider stayed, because it had forfeit = 0 (cause Lateral Damage). He deployed Gold Leader In Gold 1(v) to set up Celebration. I battled him again, but he canceled the battle, I grabbed that stupid Alternative To Fight and moved one Star Destroyer to Coruscant for an vier damage. He forgot to retrieve with Celebration, but made a force drain of total 6 and moved to Coruscant. I asked him to look at his hand to tell me how much a Spiral cost for an react, if it is 2, but he didnt look me through if he has it in hand. However, I deployed another Star Destroyers to battle Gold Leader in Gold 1(v) and he deployed Spiral. I responsed with that DS It Can Wait (dont know the full and exact name for it) and gave him another overflow of 9.<br/>
That was probably game, because he has to pay for his Battle Plan and I just drained him out.<br/>
FW by +14<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: my LS Combat Kart vs his BHBM<br/>
There happened not much. I started the race, won it, set up Yoda on Naboo with a Lightsaber. He canceled the Lightsaber and battle Yoda away with EPP 4-Lom and Boba Fett, BH. I deployed some more Jedis to Nabbo to battle him and he started to track. After 1 hour of playing he tracked his whole pile and deployed Maul and Vader to the other, free Naboo site to flip me. I knew, that I cannot combat him away, but I tried it and lost. He moved Vader to the other side and I tried to cover his direct damage with screaming Lando, but he had an Imperial Barrier in hand BUT made the mistake to battle the next turn, so Vader was lost. When I saw, that he burned all his shield, I made every turn combats, which lost me alot of force and propably another 30 minutes. Yoda was still on table, I deployed Luke, moved him over and inserted Never Tell Me Odds, meaning, his tracking is gone + he would lose about 10 cards. I moved Yoda back from the Boss Nass Chamber to the Cores and got rid of Maul. However, I had 9 life force left, he had about 11. I think the insert killed him mostly and he conceeded. He couldnt drain anymore (drain at Emperor is not allowed due my objective) and lost his tracking. <br/>

Good:<br/>
- Me, beeing cool during play against Angelo. I was really nervous<br/>
- Angelo for your email<br/>
- Angelo for not moving the Outrider to Bespin: Cloud City<br/>
- Choking Obi<br/>
- won another v-card... I didnt virtualized my first, because I still got no restriction for it... Scott???<br/>
- a bye for next years MPC to defend my title.<br/>
<br/>
Not so good:<br/>

- Another Staubfaenger<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
General goodies:<br/>
We had really good price support. Thanks to all who made it possible.<br/>
<br/>
General not so goodies:<br/>
I had to pay some, because some forgot to pay their food<br/>
Julian didnt make it because of Bahnstreik?<br/>
Writing a bracket to change it the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this was Europeans Year Ender... and my year. I won Europeans, !!Tierfon!!, that MPC, 2 locals and was runner up at Ryloth. I hope Kris will beat my up next year for my big mouth and my arrogant style in my talkin... but you know, its all fun. Dont get mad of me just because I am a idiot ;)<br/>
<br/>
However, for next year suspect even more planning. Chris, Stefaan and me already did the frame for next year and hope, that we can keep the good work and, if possible, make it even better. I hope to get it all done since Christmas and give at least the flight leaders of Europe the most important infos... well, we have to wait for Stefaan, he wanted to bring it on paper.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all soon.<br/>
Paul, hope your weekend was ok.<br/>
Dennis, its ok that you couldnt come, but just come the next year, ok? :)<br/>
