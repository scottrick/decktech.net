<blockquote><font class="bfont"> So its a week come and gone, yeah I know its a little late, but give me a break, I have been out of the loop for what seems like forever on the whole driving 5 hours for a tournament thing.<br>
<br>
At any rate, in preparation for the tournament I am thinking that I am going to have a driving partner on the way up, but Justin tells me a few days before that its too long of a drive for him and the fact that hes going to the PA local the night before kinda seals the deal. But I decide to make the drive any way for the lack of something to do on a Saturday afternoon while im on unemployment.<br>
<br>
The day begins and couldnt be any worse. I wake up at about 7am and look outside, we got 8 inches of snow the night before, joy. I then precede to take a good long look at the weather channel and determine that it isnt snowing in MI, what are the odds of that? Anyway, I decide to risk it. Before I can head to the highway, I have to drive over to Justins house to borrow a few cards for the maul deck, which we kinda keep flip flopping around for the lack of something better to play on the dark side. Of course, Ravenna, where he lives, doesnt know what a snow plow is, so im sliding all over the road in the ever so good in the snow Corolla. To top it off, I stop at the gas station by his house to get some coffee and a snickers or something, just my luck, no coffee and the only thing they have to munch on is some lifesavers, which I buy and find out once I get in my car that they have probably been sitting in that store since 1980, not to mention that gas station lady let her 3 inch dog attack me when I walked in the door, defiantly a bad start to the day.<br>
<br>
So finally I get on I-80 and start going, the first half of the 300 or so miles is spent screwing around with the damn cruise control trying to get the stupid thing to work properly, damn thing doesnt want to hold a speed, then it wants to accelerate the whole damn time. Finally I get the thing figured out, and just then WMMS starts to fade out. Great, im stuck in the Corolla with no CD player, and no good radio station, good thing I brought some back up tapes from the early 90s, go team Nirvana and NiN. Anyway, I pan the radio a little bit searching for a station that has some semblance of good music, which I figure I should find since Clear channel owns every other freaking radio station in the US and they all play the same damn thing. Eventually I find one, then spend the remaining 3 hours or so screwing with the radio station and playing 10+ year old tapes, but hey, Offspring Smash is still pretty good, so it wasnt all bad.<br>
<br>
I arrive, /cheer but wait, downtown Kalamazoo is possibly the most confusing place in the world, there are about 500 streets at each intersection going all different ways, and I cant find where I am going to save my life, little did I know that the tournament was being held at WMU, which I finally find tucked away on some hill after wandering around the city for about half an hour. Finally I find a parking space and stumble off to find the room, which thankfully doesnt take too long, and I see that James Booker and Brad Eier have also showed up, which gives me a few people to shoot the exhaust with until we kick things off.<br>
<br>
The night before I had decided on playing Maul for the dark side, and hadnt picked a light deck, TRM, Profit and QMC were all built and ready, but I wasnt really sure which I wanted to play. The week before I had played Profit in Bashcon in Toledo, and it didnt do that badly, but I was kinda bored with it, and I knew it had a bad auto loss to any kind of scum deck which I also figured might be pretty popular. So, because TRM is boring and I get antsy with it, I decide to go with QMC, which I still cant really be sure why I did, its a good deck and all, but its QMC, at best a poor deck, the only thing it really beats on a consistent basis is a setup and drain deck, like maul, but since im the only person playing maul, its a mistake that day. Anyway the tournament starts and I feel like crap for the first few games because of car lag if there is such a thing.<br>
<br>
Game One:<br>
My Dark Versus Matt Sherrington's  Light. Its my maul versus Careful Planning (v) on Endor.<br>
<br>
I probably underestimate the deck a little bit since I figure that I will be able to set up my drains quick while hes only doing moderate damage on Endor. I start off with the god hand for the deck, maul, his stick, Bane, Expand the Empire, Broken bantha and Urururur in my opening hand.. Wow, I figure its over. I deploy and draw up, setting up a drain of 7 on turn 1. In the draw I get Darth Vader w/ stick and Dr E +PB, again, wow. He starts off by going to get crix and Obi Wan (v) with balanced attack. Crix goes to the Home 1 DB, and Obi goes down to the Backdoor, that ends his turn. I drain for 7, he takes it and I go after Obi with Vader, holding Dr E for force reasons, and im holding a Dark stike combo, so I dont want him to pull a Fallen portal on someone and beat on the other. I swing at Obi and use dark strike, all I need from 2 draws is a 4, I draw 2 1s and another 1 for battle destiny, which is the start of the lose for me. I draw and cant find a ship other than the Space Cruiser, which I have no pilot for. He drains and deploys Tala 1 and cracken to space, Han and Chewie come down to the forest and he plays resistance. Im not really worried at this point, but I probally should have been considering my luck for the rest of the game. Basicly this is how the game plays out. I deploy P-59 and Dr E to Han and Chewie, I miss the shot and lose everything at the site, he keeps Resistance in effect for the entire game as I cant find a ship other than the Cruiser the whole game, it went from a great start, to a bad loss.<br>
<br>
FL  12<br>
<br>
Props: to matt, he played a good game, and to my opening hand<br>
<br>
Slops: Worst luck of all time, missing Obi with a Dark strike was horrible<br>
<br/>
Game Two:<br/>
My light QMC versus Matt Pietrangelo's Dark Black Sun.<br/>
<br/>
This game is just bad for me from start to finish. He comes early and often to the quiet city and I keep knocking him off, but I cant deal with his drains else where and his cheep deploy guys on CC. He probably retrieves 20 force from scum alone, boo. What really makes the game though is his hand about mid way through the game. I have Lebo/Dash on the outrider along with Bright Hope and Tantive sitting at the system, figuring that he wont be able to do anything about it, and I havent been able to flip yet from his constant battles on CC, it was Turn three btw. From hand, without a way to get matching ships/pilots out, he deploys Mist Hunter (v) Zuckas (v) Broken Fett, Bossk (v) Hounds Tooth (v).. FROM HAND. It was pretty bad. From then on out I couldnt keep up, and he seemed to have every counter for cards I played, whenever I had a sense, he had a control, whenever I barriered, he canceled, it was just all bad for the poor quiet city.<br/>
<br/>
FL  28, like I said, it was bad<br/>
<br/>
Props  Matt for playing a good game, and Black Sun owning out on CC<br/>
<br/>
Slops  all those ships and pilots from hand =/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three:<br/>
<br/>
Me versus the bye, I figgin owned it<br/>
<br/>
2  40, I am owning at this point. After I walk around and go for some cheep pizza with Booker and Brad im feeling better and decide to actually pick up my game from there on out, which I did actually manage to do. <br/>
<br/>
Game Four: <br/>
My Dark side, maul, versus Matt Pietrangelo's Profit<br/>
<br/>
Payback time. I am still a little miffed about the beating he gave me the game before, but its all good. I go into the game pretty wary because I know that if teched right, profit can give maul a pretty good game. I set up my drain pretty quickly and there really isnt much he can do about it. Hes got a couple of undercover spys, but I make short work of them and sit at my site and drain for 7 for pretty much most of the game, he just cant keep up as he really isnt packing much, if any, anti maul tech, like vergence of the force or other such nonsense. Overall the game goes pretty well for me, I setup like I want to and deliver some beats during the course of the game. He trys to setup but by that time its just too late to do anything as ive been draining from the second turn.<br/>
<br/>
FW +20<br/>
<br/>
Props: Maul deck for doing what it does best and Matt not having teched against it <br/>
<br/>
Slops: space was slow coming that game as well, but it really didnt make a whole lot of different<br/>
<br/>
Game Five:  <br/>
My Maul deck versus David McCure's Light Profit deck.<br/>
<br/>
I get basicly card for card matchups in back to back games. However this game plays out a little differently. I dont have a great opening hand, so I have to go down to the desert with Broken bantha and rider first turn and draw. He deploys Lando with Axe to battle, I lose urururu and opt not to draw destiny on the off chance he doesnt have a houjix. I come down hard the next turn figuring that no Houjix will be game for him. Vader, Dr E, Maul and double double blade and another urururur, I battle and of course he has a houjix, shucks, I wasted a ton of guys. Anyway, the rest of the game plays out like this. I sit at the desert and drain for 7, Vader gets uncontrollable fury on him and he and Dr E sit at the Farm for pretty much the entire game and drain for 2. Hes playing with the C30 tech, the were doomed and that stuff. Hes also got some under cover spys, which I kill pretty quick again, except for one huge tech move on his part. To save Artoo with a  gift from being killed with sniper, he pulls off a Dont forget the druids (v).. I mean, who plays with that card, but it was pretty funny. Overall the game is pretty uneventful, the last turn of the game I Helrot maul with stick to alone Han (v) at the chamber to end it, but he played a pretty smart game overall and he was draining for quite a bit near the end of the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW +9<br/>
<br/>
Props: Bane for laughing at a gift and Dont forget the druids, it was classic after I read the card for about five minutes to determine that it does what it says.<br/>
<br/>
Slops: None really, both of us played pretty good games.<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: <br/>
My QMC versus Spencer Ball's Hunt Down.<br/>
<br/>
Right away I figure that im going to have to play a hell of a game to pull this one off, HD is a terrible matchup for QMC. The game starts off him going down to CC early with Emperor (v) and janus to one site and Vader to another. Following Turn I drop Luke and Screaming Lando on Vader and cause some nice overflow, 11 or so, I lose Lando and Luke is sitting alone at the site that lets me cancel drains, and I figure I can stay alive so long as we are both losing to visage. Next turn he comes and smacks Luke for about the same overflow, great, we are able even again, but Luke at least clears the Site. The rest of the game really comes down to a few plays. Somewhere in there I get flipped and pick Tanus (v) out of my force pile to go cancel visage. Hes not doing any damage because of the canceler site on CC and the emperor not being able to move to it saves me the game. Anyway Tanus cancels and he comes at me with Dr E combo, he battles and I Path of Least Resistance to the other site, Path you are so money to work on the exe sites. Anyway, the next turn he comes at Tanus with Vader so I cant sit there and drain the whole game, I think he figures that I will draw destiny so he can lose vader, but I opt to not draw destiny and Houjix Tanus, which wins the game since vader is just sitting on the exe for the rest of the game. I am pinging him for 1 and 1 every turn and its adding up, as he isnt doing any damage at all. He comes at me with Bossk in Hounds tooth and draws two battle destinys at the system because of vader and the chamber adding his ability and I forget to use Lobot to make him lose one of the only two cards he has left in reserve deck, both are sixes, go me forgetting things, had I remembered, he would have taken a bunch of overflow and it would have been game much sooner. But its too late, and I get pretty mad, but it works out as Tantive is left sitting at the system and he really doesnt have the force to come at me for the rest of the game there. He trys to come at luke with Fett and 4lom, but the tantive is adding 1 to the cost of each one and he is denyed, money. At any rate, all the damage is coming from visage on both of us and me pinging for 1 and 1, eventually I pull it out by 1.<br/>
<br/>
FW +1<br/>
<br/>
Props: Wining by 1 of course. Path working on the executer. <br/>
<br/>
Slops: Fogetting about Lobot, damn.<br/>
<br/>
Finish for me 8 10, thats right, I managed to have 8 victory points and still have a negative differential. Rest of the results played out like this:<br/>
<br/>
1. James Booker 12(+97) <br/>
2. Brandan Pahl 8(+91 <br/>
3. Brad Eier 8(+20) <br/>
4. Nate Meeker 8(-10) ß go team, 8 -10<br/>
5. Adam Hawke 6(+9) <br/>
6. Andrew Hill 6(+18<br/>
7. Matt Sherrington 6(-22) <br/>
8. Kevin Brownell 6(-29) <br/>
9. Matt Pietrangelo 5(-20) <br/>
10. Spencer Ball 4(-7) <br/>
11. David McCure 2(-127)<br/>
<br/>
Decks that were played:<br/>
<br/>
Dark: 3 Huntdown, 2 AOBS, MKOS, IO (non-v) Yavin, Old Skool Walkers, Court, Maul deck, SYCFA (new variation). <br/>
Light: 3 Profit, 2 TRM, Endor Start, WYS, Hyperdrive, QMC, HB, MB<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I came on pretty strong at the end, including how badly I whooped up on that bye, and it was a really fun tournament despite the 5 hour drive.<br/>
<br/>
Overall- <br/>
Props: Scott Sykes for being the TD and making the whole thing happen. I suppose I have to give some props to WMU for the space, but Roger Ebert style, ill give it a very mild thumbs up, as getting there was a pain in the ass. Ohio for kicking ass, Booker, Brad and I all finishing in the top 4, go team. Offspring, Nirvana, STP and NiN for making Tapes in the early 90s so I has something to listen to, however poor the quality. <br/>
<br/>
Slops: QMC, what the hell was I thinking. The Cruse control on the damn Corolla, and the Bear station in Lancing, it was the best station I could find on the way back, and wow, it sucked. <br/>
<br/>
Till Next time,<br/>
Nate Meeker ntm2@uakron.edu, go team MAC <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
