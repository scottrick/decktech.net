<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Game 1:  My BHBM vs Todd Johnsons EBO/Ellors Cheese<br>
<br>
Ive been running BHBM since DSII came out, but my current variation focuses more on direct damage than battling, primarily via Emperors Power(v).  He started Local Uprising(v), which immediately made me uneasy, luke in a speeder can be tough to get rid of.  I started a little slow, eventually setting up Palpy and Lord Vader w. saber at a docking bay, by which point he had 5 aliens and ellors down, all under the shield.  CHYBC took care of his drains for one turn, but he dropped HCF and luke and wedge in rogue 1.  I failed miserably at this point, as blizzard 4 and maul got rocked, doing no damage, drew 3 bd, ended up with total of 1.  I spent the rest of the game looking for ZiMH or set for stun, while cloaking maul and chasing alien scrubs in blizzard 4.  It kinda sucked, kept it reasonably close though, only -13.  The want of one of like 5 cards in my deck to completely reverse the game made me a little bitter, but eh.  Cheese is cheese, always has been around, always will be, I need to pack the ellors shield.<br>
<br>
End of round 1<br>
0(-13)<br>
<br>
Game 2:  My LSC vs Kryptofis<br>
<br>
I enjoy playing against Kryptofis, which I prefer simply because I sadly have no idea how to pronounce his name, were generally evenly matched, and neither of us takes this game too seriously, so our matches are fun.  That said, right now I feel kind of lame, because I cant remember what he played that game, or even any real detail, just that it was semi close, although he held an advantage the entire game, probably shouldn't have taken 2 weeks off before trying to write this.  I ended up losing by 13 again.<br>
<br>
End of round 2<br>
0(-26)<br>
<br>
At this point Im a little disgruntled, as Im like 2nd to last or something, even considering changing my decks, to which Ive only made minor changes to since taking a year off.  My laziness overruled the idea, so I decided to stick to my decks.<br>
<br>
Game 3:  LS vs Cody Bye<br>
<br>
Cody had some sort of moving thing going on, and dropped himself for the round, so I got a win with 20 differential.<br>
<br>
End of round 3<br>
2(-6)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldve preferred this type of score two games in, but oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  BHBM vs Dan Tartagliones WHAP<br/>
<br/>
I felt pretty good about this game once objectives were revealed, confidence that was soon to be lost.  I dropped palpy to the throne room, pulled force lightning, drew one or two and said go.  He didnt deploy anything, so I reinforced with epp maul.  A few battles were fought over the throne room, eventually me losing control.  I had never lost the throne room and won vs whap before, and I got kind of bitter/figured Id lose.  I took over the other theed sites though, never losing real control over them, finally wiping out most of his jedi.  Vader and bfbh took on panaka, sabe, random republic pilot dude and amidala, panaka got choked, sabe was lost to forfeit.  Next battle vader choked amidala, overflowed sabe by like 16 or something, ending the game.  I won by 8 cards, and had something like 6 stacked for battles, had a pretty big effect on the game.  Neither of us played this one very well, partially due to holotable bugging out a bit, but I mayve been playing a few sit and gos in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
End of round 4/final result<br/>
4(2)<br/>
<br/>
I would have preferred to do better in this thing, no idea what the final standings are, will probably be released about the same time I post this report, but all in all not too sad, it being the first even semi legit tournament Ive played in since like 2004.  If nothing else, Ive actually been enjoying playing swccg for the first time in awhile.  Huge props to psychobabble for organizing this, hes a great guy, we both started playing online around the same time, both doing a lot in the old wwl, but he actually did something proactive online, while I got burned out and lurked for a year.  Only negative comment, random Canadian dude that tried t get everyone to boycott the tournament, cmon man, whats the point?<br/>
