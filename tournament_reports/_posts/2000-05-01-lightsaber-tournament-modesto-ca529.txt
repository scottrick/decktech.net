<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Another tourney report guys......lightsaber tourney at Modesto this past Saturday, April 29th. The prize......A replica of Obi-Wan's lightsaber from Episode 1. The players.....Paul Todd Feldman, Clayton Atkin, Kevin Shannon, Ohmy Fasudhani, Hak Soo Kim, Chris Leung, Peter Nordstrom, and myself, The Brahma Bull, with 14 others....who got the saber? Read on.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Announcements for this tourney was made awhile ago(prior to the CA State Champs) in hopes of getting a big turnout. I'd say with 22 people showing up, they did a good job. Anyways unlike my other tournaments I had no time to prep for this one......had some issues to resolve at school amongst other things and I couldnt touch my decks for nearly the entire week. Friday came and I went to playtest a new Raltiir Ops deck I made with some friends, but it didnt fit my style. Talked to Chris Leung that night and was wondering who would be driving, and he said theyll figure it out tomorrow so lights out for now.<br>
<br>
I woke up kinda late and called up Chris Saturday morning. He's at Hak Soo's fixing up decks and waiting for Ohmy to wake up. I call him back about 10 minutes later and theyre on thier way to my house. So much for fixing my decks.......eh, I have confidence in the decks I have made, so I just take those and some backup cards in case I want to change. I was hoping to fix them at the tourney.....but as luck would have it, we get lost and get to the tourney late, but early enough that we could still play.  Turns out we got an uneven turnout so I volunteer for the bye and work on my decks.....and finish in 10 minutes. Another guy comes in later and we get it on in the first game.....<br>
<br>
LS: Speed Profit<br>
DS: Hunt Down High Destinies<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS Hunt Down HDestinies vs. Brad's LS Y4 Throne Room Mains <br>
<br>
Murphy must be watching me because everything that could go wrong did. He started Y4 Throne Room essentials and I start Hunt Down and Crush the Rebellion. He grabs his Nudjs as I look for some sites and/or Mara and Bubo. He drops Goo Nee Tay first turn and my game goes down from there. He invades Executor with Momaw Nadon and EPP Leia, and drains there for a long while. I cant draw any sites, my Mara or Bubo, and end up losing a few sites and Mara off the top to Visage. Great.....well only the shaft can even it out. I shaft Leia and drop Zuckuss there. He drops OTE on his turn to even things out....wonderful. He continues to drop EPP Luke with Lightsaber Prof at my War Room and hit me for 2 a turn there as well as OTE damage. I drop Vader down with his saber and YABeaten Leia and smack on Momaw.....but like I said everything that can go wrong does and I miss the hack. He loses 9 instead of 12 for him and I continue to do nothing but lose to OTE and he loses to shaft. I die out when he drops Lando and ECC Chewie to Kessel and hit me for about 10 a turn. Lose by 13.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 0(-13)<br>
Highs: Getting shaft out<br>
Lows: Missing the hack on freakin Momaw Nadon, getting off to a bad start<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2:  LS Speed Profit vs. Mark's DS Y4 Occupation<br>
<br>
Game starts off with him taking some time out to read Profit. Appearantly he's never seen the card before. He declines to start aliens and starts Yavin 4, &lt;&gt; Swamp, and the ops Objective. I drop Master Luke and saber early to free Han while he grabs sites and saves force. Im pretty prone to beatdown as Im not sure why he's not deploying, so I drop Ben and his saber to prevent beats. He starts dropping AT-ATs to Yavin with pilots and drops a few TIEs and a Dread to Yavin. I drop ECC Lando to JP and move Luke there as well, and leave Han with Ben. He drains, drops more TIEs to Yavin. I drain, hit him with Profit and drop Mos Eisley and move Lando there alone(I got It's A Trap! in hand). I set up A Gift and now Zuckuss and Danz borin arent draining anymore. He sets up RBOccupation but I cancel with Endor Celebration. I drop Chewie and Boussh to Yavin and battle for awhile but he cleans me out with Igar. I stay on Tatooine hit him for 8 a turn to his 2. Win by 20.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+7)<br>
Highs: Getting back into the game.<br>
Lows: Nothing Much.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS Speed Profit vs. Adrien's 'I stole Josh's decks' JP Mains<br/>
<br/>
Josh spends alot of time gawking at this game, which I found kind of annoying. This is Adriens first tournament....okay. Well he forgets to start aliens to Profit and Josh(The TD) starts to nag him about it. He started Cantina and JP to convert mine, and my AC gets converted first turn. He drops Choke Vader with saber to the Cantina while I draw for some characters. I drop Ben and Luke with both thier sabers to AC and sit. He drains, and drops Mara to Ben and Luke. He shafts Luke. ARGH. Oh well, im prepped for it, but I got to see if he's playing Senses. My turn I Signal and he Senses.....great. He's got 5 more cards in hand......I drop Boushh to Mara and play Double Agent to try and kill her. Sense. He's now got 4 cards in hand, and he just used up 2 Senses.....I have Edge but Im thinking of whether of not to use it. I decide to use it, since he's used up 2 Senses and now and he's only got 4 cards left. I play Edge......Sense. AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH(anything that can go wrong, WILL)!!!! Well, thats pretty much lock out for the shaft now and I lose to it for the rest of the game. I drop Tawss to the AC, move Ben and Han to JP and break Boushh's cover, have Luke give her the saber(transferring) and move her to AC. He drains, I lose to shaft. I drain for 6 a turn in addition to Profit damage. I look for OTE, but I lose it off the top(Damn you, Murphy), as well as Do or Do Not for SAC damage as well. We forget about shaft for a few turns and he continues to drain at Cantina as well as drops U-3PO to the AC and stops my drains there. I cant do a thing about 3PO so I try to spread more. I leave Bron burs at the AC and he drops Fett. I battle fett, he shoots, and hits. I draw destiny......you guessed it.....ZERO. Hahahahahaha well thats game. Lose by 2.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 2(+5)<br/>
Highs: I only lost by 2, didnt I?<br/>
Lows: I can lose to scrubs but I cant lose to the good players.......hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We take a break for lunch, and Chris, Hak, Ohmy, and myself walk to Taco Bell and grab some munchies. We talk about our matches and have a Hak and Ohmy go into a dispute over the hot sauce at Taco Bell(Hahaha). Hak is undefeated but has a timed win.....Chris lost one, Ohmy as well, and I bring up the rear with 2 losses. We 'threaten' Hak and tell him he's better win or else the trip would be wasted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS Hunt Down HDestinies vs. Chris's LS 'Juz's Revenge' variant<br/>
<br/>
We get back and I get matched with Brad(from my first game) but we've already played each other with the same sides so I get to play Chris instead. <br/>
He starts Y4 essentials but with the &lt;&gt; Jungle instead of the &lt;&gt; Swamp. I drop Vader first turn and cause him Visage damage the rest of the game. I walk Vader to the Throne Room and set him there with Tarkin and his saber to smash Chris for 3 a turn. He drops Projection to cut it down to 2 and inserts Numbers. I drain, and draw and find a Torture. Numbers doesnt hit for awhile and he drops EPP Leia and EPP Han to the Throne Room to try and stop Visage damage. Turns out he cant battle(Hunt Down), and he cant move them both away. I activate, and numbers hits but were pretty even now and I only lose 2 force. I drop Fett to deal with Han and Leia.....battle, chop Leia, shoot Han, he misses both his shots. I draw double he does too, and I clean them out and he kills off Tarkin and Fett. For the rest of that game, I drain for 2, he loses to Visage every turn, and Numbers doesnt do a thing to me. Win by 30.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+35)<br/>
Highs: Coming back<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS Hunt Down HDestinies vs. Kyle's LS Profit<br/>
<br/>
First game with Kyle and it would be my most fun for the day. Clayton Atkin is sitting right next to us so me and him go at it all game long. He starts Profit goods and I start Jabba and Fett to AC and Crush. I drop IG-88 to add destinies with Fett, and draw for Vader. He draws. I drop Choke Vader and saber to the Cantina and draw. He drops a Bothan to the Holotheatre and drops......Obi-Wan to protect him. Great...guess he doesnt know what Hunt Down does. I drain, drop IAO to lock Obi in and he draws for the next 6-7 turns. He finally drops Master Luke with Anakins to JP and makes me flip back. I go at him with Igar and Tempest and draw double ZEROs but he draws a ZERO too so its all good. His turn he battles me and I lose Igar and he loses Luke. I drop Tarkin to secure Tempest and drain for 5 a turn now. He tries to free Han with Luke and Chewie but Chewie gets killed. My turn, I capture Luke and thats pretty much game. Win by 31.<br/>
<br/>
Cumlative Score: 6(+67)<br/>
Highs: Getting back into it<br/>
Lows: Nothing much<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS Speed Profit vs. Ohmy Fasudhani's DS Raltiir Ops<br/>
<br/>
Argh....I play 2 people in my car. Oh well....I pretty much lost this because our previous games were less than convincing. He has problems finding his sites early so I have a small advantage, but Murphy strikes again and I get the WORST POSSIBLE draws in the world for Profit. He sets up, I flip, and we do our damage. He draining for 6 a turn at Raltiir and Kashyyyk and i draing for 1 and 3 from Profit.....I cant go over to Raltiir because I cant find squat for characters and I keep losing them off the top. I pretty much draw my characters late when it doesnt matter anymore and its just me spreading on Tatooine and he drops a walker to JP to make me go back. he continues his drains and thats pretty much game. Loss by 12.<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6(+55)<br/>
Highs: Nothing Much<br/>
Lows: Too many to name.....playing 2 people in my car, getting beat by scrubs, pulling crap from prize support.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish the day 3-3 and I get a respectable 8th place. Chris finishes 4-2 and places 5th. Ohmy gets in the second place and the winner, is of course, the 'Master of Evil', Hak Soo Kim. I get crap for prize support and end the day. The tournament was okay but I learned a few things. Most important ones is its time to change decks and move on......the car ride home was a fun one as Hak got dissed about.......IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT ABOUT. Well, The Rock won Backlash so Im gonna win the next few tourneys Im at.....its guran-damn-teed..:)<br/>
