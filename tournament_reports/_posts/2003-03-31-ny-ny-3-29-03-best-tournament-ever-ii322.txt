<br>
--- intro ---<br>
Several weeks ago, I learned about a standard open tournament scheduled for March 29 at Neutral Ground. I quickly told most of the LI players about it. By the time the day came, only four of us could make it. <br>
<br>
This weekend was set to be full of good SWCCG action. The Neutral Ground tournament was on Saturday while another tournament at I-CON was Sunday. Some time before the actual events, I decided to use different decks both days. For lightside, I decided to stay with QMC. For darkside, Dark Deal seemed really solid so I picked that. I have liked Dark Deal for a few months now, but I rarely got the chance to use it. Entering this tournament, I was 2-0 lifetime with Deal in tournaments.<br>
<br>
I get some good help on decks from Phillip Legolas Aasen. His version of QMC didn't really agree with mine, but his version of Deal proved helpful. <br>
<br>
The day arrives, and I haven't really tested with either deck. I did know the Deal deck beat my QMC and my HB decks, but that was it. My parents have to go to a special doctor in the city, so they give me a ride. I get dropped off at NG around 12:30. The start time is 2:00 p.m. so that's a long wait. Eventually I see Marty Rossa who I know just had four wisdom teeth removed the day before.  I also get introduced to Joe "KingFelix" Bopp who you should know if you visit any SWCCG message boards. He knows the rules really well, and I was looking forward to meeting him. When I'm asked, "Where are you from?", I reply, "Long Island." I get a dirty look from Joe saying, "Oh, you're one of those." Haha. <br>
<br>
Some other kid (Dave) shows up from New Jersey who hasn't played in awhile. His latest cards are from the Death Star II Expansion. The rest of the Long Island "Crew" consisting of Brad Vogel, Greg Zinn, and Wayne Cullen walks through the doors. Joe Bisz from Binghamton also made the trip down. We have a total of eight players after Tom comes in. Joe tells us that the TD, Jason Robinette, had an emergency and can't make it. Joe will function as the TD in his place, and chooses to not participate so we don't have any byes. <br>
<br>
--- begin tourney ---<br>
My rating: 1883<br>
My light: QMC with high destiny<br>
My dark: Dark Deal (the way everyone else plays it plus a few "surprises") <br>
<br>
King Felix looks at his clock and announces, "You may now begin. You have one hour to play." Officialness.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Dark Vs. Tom Main's (1500) QMC<br>
We're both on Cloud City so this should be an interesting, interactive game. He starts Keeping the Empire Out Forever, Squadron Assignments, and Saitor Kalfas (v). I start Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans, I'm Sorry, Molator (v), and the Mob Points combo. I pull the Executor and my sites. I also had one of my sites in my hand. On my turn, I convert his Bespin and pull my 1/0 docking bay. I also draw into some good cards like They Must Never Again Leave This City. On his turn, he draws some as he only activates 5. I go and activate/save. Tom deploys the Outrider with Dash to Bespin. I respond with my free Executor with Admiral Thrawn aboard. I battle, but both of my draws are low, causing Tom to only lose a few overflow. He keeps trying to find his Red Squadron 1 with Squadron Assignments, but it isn't there. I kick Dash off the system and set-up Occupation with Prophetess and Bane Malar. EPP Qui-gon battles them but not much results from that. I keep pinging him for a drain of one or two and hitting him with Occupation damage. Tom kills off Bane with Corran Horn at one point leaving Cloud City pretty much empty. However, a bunch of my characters deploy to Cloud City to set up the DEAL. The game is over shortly after this as I'm doing about 12 damage each turn. Tom finally sees his Red Squadron 1 as he loses it off the top to some damage. I win by 27.<br>
FW 2(+27)<br>
Highlights: Winning and actually having a few battles<br>
Lowlights: Trying to mindscan Corran. He has 4 ability? Oops.<br>
<br>
Joe Bisz beat Dave by 30+ with MBO. MBO!!! Wow. <br>
<br>
Brad IO (v) deck took down Greg. Everytime I go over to see their game, someone starts coughing, and I think I can almost hear the word "scouter" in the sound. It must just be my imagination though...<br>
<br>
Wayne lost to Marty's Imperial Occupation (v) as well, seeing as that deck is broken, especially in the absence of any LU (v) decks. <br>
<br>
Game 2: My Light Vs. Joe Bisz's (1682) BHBM Tie Bombers (?)<br>
Joe starts Planetary Subjugation, Mob Points, and Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans. I start Wokling (v), Squadron Assignments, and Keeping the Empire Out Forever. Joe pulls Wakeelmui. He then activates and deploys Reflections II Palpy to his Throne Room with the Emperor's Power. He also pulls a 1/0 docking bay. On my turn, I just draw/save after pulling a site. Joe pulls another 1/0 docking bay and deploys Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith to one of my sites. On my turn, I give him virtual Luke and deploy Wedge in ship to Bespin. Joe deploys Darth Sidious to another CC site and loses one to his objective. I reinforce Wedge with Dash in Outrider. He deploys Dreaded Imperial Starfleet and starts cancelling my drain. Eventually, after saving enough, I deploy R3 Lando and EPP Obi-wan to flip with. The rest of the game consists of Joe attempting to chase my guys around. He has to pay to drain, while I don't. I also set up Celebration later on in the game. The one key battle is when Joe deploys Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Boba in front of my Lando, Scoundrel. Someone else is in front of my EPP Obi. Joe decides to battle Lando first. I lose a six to First Strike and then pay 1 to retrieve it, adding to my power. Then I Path over EPP Obi-wan. I hit Dr E. and his friend, and draw two fives for battle destiny. The battle ends with me losing Lando and Joe losing 17 more force for overflow. That pretty much seals the game. On the next turn, I drain in space, which he cancels. Then I Path Obi in front of his EPP Maul at the Carbonite Chamber. I play Transmission Terminated on his The Phantom Menace. I play Sorry About the Mess to kill off Maul with a total destiny of 8. Then I drain for two. Obi becomes the target of Off the Edge allowing me to retrieve 5. Celebration and Wokling play their part. My drains and Joe's BHBM objective do him in. He told me he was afraid of going to space because of my X-wing cannon. I win by 33. <br>
FW 4(+60)<br>
Highlights: Winning the game, the big battle, and the Path/TT/SATM combo<br>
Lowlights: None for the most part. Wait, THE EMPEROR (R2) shouldn't be used in a deck.<br/>
<br/>
Brad lost a timed game to Wayne. That's rough. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Light Vs. Brad Vogel's (1956) Broken Imperial Occupation (v)<br/>
Brad is the highest of the 1-1 players. He starts Prepare for a Surface Attack, Imperial Decree, You May Start Your Landing, IAO &amp; SP, and Imperial Domination (v). I start the usual. Brad Imperial Commands on turn 1 for someone (Thrawn?), and I play All Wings combo for Artoo in Red 5. Brad also pulls the 3rd Marker and a Walker Garrison. He deploys his sites with an Ice Storm and does some other things. I deploy Luke in ship to Bespin and pull a site. Brad's Ice Storm moves over and he deploys Blizzard 1 (v) with Veers to blow up the generators. I flip with Leia (v) and Puccumir on the next turn. Brad goes and blows up the generators. Between that and drains/walker damage, I take 12 damage (ouch). Brad also deploys Chimaera with Thrawn aboard to Hoth. He also spreads to a bunch of marker sites. I deploy Wedge in ship and some more guys to Cloud City sites. I move over Luke and Wedge to Hoth. Brad gets in a turn of Walker Garrison drains, which hurts a lot. The next turn, I deploy Menace Fades. I move Luke back to Bespin to fulfill that. Then I land Wedge at the blown away site to keep Fades in effect. Brad tries to beat up on Wedge with Blizzard 2, but he doesn't have any force icons on the site so he has to settle for moving over to block my controlling it. EPP Qui-gon and a blind 7 take care of his walker. Brad decides to move over his Chimaera with Thrawn, Evax, DS-61-2, and Darth Vader (v) aboard to Bespin. All I can do is run around for awhile pinging him for 4. Brad finishes me off with his drains/damage. Cabbel/Ozzel take out a Puccumir for some overflow as well. I lose by 16.<br/>
FL 4(+44)<br/>
Highlights: Staying in it even after losing 26 force in two turns.<br/>
Lowlights: Losing to "the most brokenest deck ever" Or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Joe Bisz won again by 30+  with MBO. His differential is amazing even though I beat him by 33.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my good luck, I get paired with Brad again.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Dark Vs. Brad Vogel's (1956) WYS Jedi Luke style<br/>
This game is tough for Brad. He sees me start Mob Points so he goes with Don't Do That Again. He also starts Squadron Assignments and Insurrection &amp; Aim High. I start IAO &amp; SP, I'm Sorry, Mob points combo, and Molator (v). I pull my sites and also got one in hand. I deploy them all. I also pull a 1/0 docking bay and deploy Bespin. I let Brad go. Brad pulls Kessel and his Home One docking bay. He also deploys Dash in Outrider to my Bespin. On my turn, I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to Bespin. I fulfill Don't Do That Again, so I pull my Executor. I deploy the free Executor effect to get it out. I put Thrawn aboard. I battle and cause some overflow after Brad loses Dash/ship. This discourages Brad as it's only the 2nd turn. He pulls his &lt;&gt; docking bay and deploys Captain Han/Falcon there. He deploys Jedi Luke and saber to the Home One docking bay. He transits over to my Cloud City docking bay. I deploy Nute, Palpy, and Occupation. I ping Brad for drains of one and Occupation damage every turn. He gets Mirax in ship up to Tatooine with Han. Jedi Luke is reinforced by a Ralltiir Freighter Captain for some reason. Stunning Leader kept my guys alive a little longer. Brad spreads Jedi Luke in front of Palpy and leaves a lone RFC at the Upper Walkway. I battle him with Blizzard 4, but Brad has Run Luke Run. I can just Ghhhk any damage I incur though. To put more pressure on Brad, I stick EPP Maul into his Cantina for another drain. Now I'm draining for about 6 a turn plus 3 from Occupation. Brad can't do much other than drain for 3. He keeps himself in it with an On the Edge or two. In a last ditch effort, he moves all his ships in front of my Executor at Bespin. I drop Guri and Battle Deployment. Then I battle and clear Han, Talon Karrde, and his Falcon. Brad retreats with Mirax back to Tatooine before being drained out. I never had to deploy Dark Deal either. I win by 15.<br/>
FW 6(+59)<br/>
Highlights: Beating Brad of course. A 2nd turn Executor/Thrawn/Zuckuss can help with that. I also have a 2-0 lifetime record against WYS in tournament play. Guess who both those games were against... <br/>
Lowlights: Don't Do That Again? Bah.  <br/>
<br/>
So Joe Bisz wins his last game by another insane margin to come out in first. <br/>
<br/>
Brad and Greg both went 2-0 with their walker objective decks. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
1. Joe Bisz <br/>
2. Greg Zinn <br/>
3. Chris Wod!cka (me) <br/>
4. Brad Vogel <br/>
5. Marty Rossa<br/>
6. Wayne Cullen <br/>
7. Tom Main<br/>
8. Dave ?<br/>
<br/>
We receive zero prize support. Neutral Ground rocks! Then again, it was a free tournament. However, I really wanted another Lando in Falcon foil.<br/>
<br/>
We race back to Penn Station in the rain. Wayne narrowly gets there in time for his train home. I eat fast food and go home. I had to think up new decks for the next day's I-CON. The TR for that is coming.<br/>
