<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pretourney<br>
<br>
	It was the normal day before the tourney. I go to my friend&amp;#8217;s house, play some Team Fortress Classic, and fix my decks at 11:00 while watching the tape of the previous night&amp;#8217;s WWF Smackdown. I don&amp;#8217;t spend as much time on my decks as usual because I know what I want to do. For my dark I&amp;#8217;m playing my HD admirals deck and all I have to do for that is add zuckus in ship and guri. For light I end up making a force choking New age throne room deck. Its great vs. ties and scum, pretty decent vs HD and bhbm. <br>
<br>
	I get to Video Connection on time and get a few trades. Before long , we get 20 people and the TD, Morris, actually arrived close to on time. We get started a little earlier than usual and I&amp;#8217;m ready to play. Hayes and Eric Hunter don&amp;#8217;t show so I am pretty confident. Steve Baroni does show so I figure he is my main competition. My rating going into this tournament is 2036 or something like that. <br>
<br>
        			Games<br>
<br>
Game 1 My Light vs Jeff&amp;#8217;s That thing&amp;#8217;s operational ties and tatoine deck. <br>
<br>
	The game starts out very slow with him starting the endor system and me getting out no twixes or goo nee tays . I keep drawing for some twixes and some starships and I eventually get them. By now he has the death star constructed but he has no systems to move it to and I have honor out anyways. I fight and run at his endor with my home 1 but he gets out the superlaser so I run away while moving my falcon deeper into his death stsr. I eventually blow it away and he is choked for force. My superfalcon and super home 1 are staying at endor with order to engage and he has no choice but to fight me. I destroy his space fleet within a few turns and only lose 1 or 2 scrub pilots. Out of desperation he putws down chief retwin to his just deployed jundland wastes and saves 3 force. I am very happy because I dploy chewie protector and cancel retwin&amp;#8217;s text. Then down comes twass, orri, and obi w/saber. I predict I win, hit retwin, draw a 5 and that is game.<br>

Game 2 My dark vs Jeremy&amp;#8217;s There is good in him mains.<br>
<br>
	I really don&amp;#8217;t remember much about this game.I do remember that my opponent had a cast on his arm so playing was pretty difficult for him. I got out my lord and saber to the executor db and moved over to the endor db to capture luke. I then put down a tarkin and moved them both back to the ds db. I then spread to carida with devastator and chiraneau. Mara and saber come down to the endor db and dengar in ship goes to space. He gets out no locations so only generates 6 a turn. Visage stays out the whole game . He attacks me only once with and obi w/saber against mara and saber but he gets barriered. I then deploy Xizor, Mighty Jabba, and fett. I battle, hit obi, obi misses mara, and I draw a 14 total to his 3. I win the battle and he has to lose a lot extra.This keeps the objective flipped and I easily drain/visage him out.<br>

Game 3 My light vs Steve baroni&amp;#8217;s destiny 7&amp;#8217;s HD dueler<br>
<br>
	I lost this game early. We were both setting up our locations and our db scrubs. HE got out vader and saber and I took a few turns of visage and drains. I have jedi luke at the H1 db but I don&amp;#8217;t think he&amp;#8217;ll be enough to hold a site so I deploy obi w/saber aas backup. This proves to be a big mistake as he is dueled 2 turns later easily. Losing that 9 force and obi put me in a very bad situation. Luke was the next to be dueled and although I piled on guys to the ground, they all eventually were killed by his multiple destiny and weapons.  I got a little damage in by putting spies all over the executor and putting wedge and spiral to carida but they were taken care of in good time. The spiral met a zuckus and a tracked 7 and the spies on executor met bounty hunters and tracked 7&amp;#8217;s. My bacta tank would have helped but I had very little force left in my deck. I just did as much with the bacta tank as I could before I got drained out.<br>

Game 4 My dark  vs Travis Ruman&amp;#8217;s WYS Tatoine celebration.<br>
<br>
	I started out fast with a vader to the executor db and moving it over to his tat. db. He couldn&amp;#8217;t get any of his TT so Visage was out and hurting him almost the whole game. He flipped with captain han on falcon flying at the tatoine system and mirax and palace raider on a racing skiff at his hutt trade route. I decided to strengthen my drains on the ground before taking out the threats. I deployed vaders saber, tarkin, mara and saber to the ds db, and emperor to his tat. db. I had a barrier and PASOA for protection though. I took his drain of 2 and I was surprised that he put down tat. celebration without adding to his small fleet at tatooine. I came down on the system with chimara, thrawn, chiraneau, and dengar in ship. I battled and after seeing he had no battle destiny adders I played imp. Command to add a destiny. I drew 3 solid destinies and all I lost was chirasneau. He lost captain han, falcon and a few more.I had control of tatooine so I was in great shape( celebration cancelled). I then put down Xizor and Mighty jabba to his ground force and took the out. Unfortunately he plays old ben to revive one and bacta taks another so I do pretty much no damage. We battle some more on the ground and he beats me off the site. That is okay though because I&amp;#8217;ve been draining for 5 or 6 every turn and he is practically dead. The game is over a few turns later.<br>

Game 5 My light side  vs Rick Gaudioso&amp;#8217;s BHBM with ties+cannons and imp. Commands.<br/>
<br/>
This was a very boring game at first with me getting first turn goo nee tay and setting up my twixes. There is no open db for awhile so I dogpile on carida with liberty, wedge, blount, and hashyn. My luke and obi are giving me extra force at the H! and echo db until he deploys the CC db. I move them over and start to drain there. Rick is having trouble getting force so he has to take a few drains of 1 and has to save up force. He eventually gets a large space force at carida and starts to win a lot of battles. We have a few battles on ground but the he ran away to the DSII db.I keep losing blount to attrition  in battles in space but bacta tank ressurects him about 6 times.OTE keeps him battling and his scrubs are dying permanently. There are 4 cards stacked on Insignificant rebellion and vader has luke captured. I move my remaining mains back and fortht  to his emperor and vader. They have to battle with OTE but he instead choses to lose 3. Time has run out and it comes down to vader and emperor in the DSII throne room. He duels luke and he wins the duel by about 4 leaving me safe for the win. I only have to lose 1 because honor of the jedi is out.The game is over and I have much more force left than him: His 3 life force to my 19.<br/>

<br/>
Game 6 my dark vs Joe&amp;#8217;s flipping , matching ships+pilots, kessel running , HB.<br/>
<br/>
This game was over in 10 minutes flat. I got vader and saber to the ds db as well as the emperor and janus.This set me up for drains of 3 a turn plus the visage damage that wasn&amp;#8217;t stopped. He gets out all his systems that give me a total of about 8 extra force. Joe also throws away literally 4 tunnel visions in one turn of drawing. He also puts a lone dash in ship at kessel. I respond next turn in a very nasty way.  Zuckus in ship, chimera and thrawn , bosk in ship, and chiraneau come down . So does lateral damage. I draw a total of 14 and he can&amp;#8217;t draw. I win the battle and the game with 7 cards still in hand.<br/>
FW by 31<br/>
9(+114)<br/>
<br/>
So I donâ€™t do great and I get in 3rd place. My rating will go down a few points but not much. Here are the few standings I remember or that I think are correct:<br/>
1. Steve Baroni 11(+143)<br/>
2. Paul Ladenbach 10(+60 something or 80 something)<br/>
3. Michael Schiemer 9(+114) <br/>
4. Paul Maholick( I think) 9(+60 something) <br/>
<br/>
The prize are decent with Steve getting a foiled Imp. Decree, Paul getting a foiled signal(nice card) and me getting the disgraceful 5 CC packs(look under slops).<br/>
