<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This is the story of how i scrubbed out at PA states. There’s three sections to this report: pre-tourney jizz, actual game detail, and wrap-up. Each is clearly labeled so you can skip to whatever part you like best. Enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
PRE-TOURNEY JIZZ<br>
Friday night (18th) is my little brother’s birthday and he gets this kick-arse playstation game in his gifts, it’s called Einhander and it’s a spaceship shoot-em-up made by Squaresoft of all people. I think this is like the greatest game of all time, better than sleeping, so I stay up till like 6 am playing it. Sleep for 6 hours and hop in the ’81 Cadillac Sedan DeVille with my dad as he is dropping me off in Pittsburgh at 1.<br>
<br>
I meet Jim Li on a street corner on the campus of Carnegie Mellon U, and a couple minutes later our ride, Dean Richmond (props to him), shows up from across the street. I say I wanna play some in the car but Jim is above my level I guess and he won’t do it. He spends most of the time reading some Nazi book with a swastika on the cover while I talk on AIM on my cell and all three of us chat idly about SWCCG, etc.<br>
<br>
The drive is uneventful except for when we exit this one tunnel some @#$% throws a Pizza Hut wrapper out his window in front of us and it gets stuck to Dean’s windshield wiper. He uses the wipers, sprays, and everything but he cant get it off. So he freakin rolls his window down and reaches out at like 70 mph and picks it off his wiper. Skills.<br>
<br>
So we get to the sprawling slab of urbana that is Carlisle, PA at like 5 i think and drive around looking for the Holiday Inn where the tourney will be held the next day. Find it and it’s booked so we stay in the Econo Lodge across the street. Apparently the folks at the EL were in the know about the big event next day cuz they asked Dean if that’s what we were here for. So hey, word’s getting around town that some card players are coming in ... riiight<br>
<br>
No sooner do we enter the cubbyhole we will be occupying for the evening does Jim declare that he wants to play. So I’m like "it’s about time you gave up the Nazi book" and whip out this crappy ISB deck i have put together. Jim summed this deck up nicely by telling me it was like Brian Hunter’s, only worse. I beat him but I still agree with his assessment.<br>
<br>
We playtest for a while then hit this Western Sizzlin steakhouse for dinner, it was decent i suppose. I got the steak &amp; shrimp meal which was pretty good except the steak was about the size of a hockey puck. Speaking of, the Penguins got their asses handed to them by the Devils and Dean, Jim, and I were none too pleased =/<br>
<br>
So there’s this mini-golf across between the EL and the Holiday Inn and on the way back we’re all jokin about playin, so we decide to head over and play. Dean and I both pick Magic 8 balls but Jim picks the demon-possessed blue ball from hell. He gets a hole-in-one first hole but proceeds to suck royally for the rest of the course. I hang within one stroke of Dean until about the 14th hole where I screw up pretty bad and go down by too much to recover, and we stop taking score. Then on the "19th hole" thing where if you get a hole in one you get a free game Dean sinks one but we sure as hell aren’t sticking around so he can wreck us again.<br>
<br>
Back to the room for some more SWCCG and it’s looking like Hunt Down was gonna be the dark deck for me. I also had a Profit that had been doing really well in locals and I was considering playing it but it failed in testing against Jim’s MKOS and I switched it to TRM. In retrospect, I should have stuck with the Profit.<br>
<br>
Dean had brought a sleeping bag and he hits the hay at like 11. He deserved the sleep for driving and all. The only bed in the room is mad small and there’s obviously no way Jim and I are gonna share it so we decide to play another game, winner gets the bed. Well, Jim performs in the clutch and takes me out and then he’s like "I’m gonna lay down" and I’m like "it’s early, I’m goin out for a walk to see if there’s anything goin on" but there was no sign of life outside the hotel whatsoever so i go back in the room and Jim has turned all the lights off. It’s barely midnight! I’m like "bah" and I grab my decks and lists I had printed out and go outside and fill them out for the next day.<br>
<br>
Decks are Hunt Down mains and TRMains, pretty standard stuff. Except my freakin TRM deck had a Beggar in it because the original version had the Tat DBay and all Bens but I switched the Tat DBay out and made the Bens EPPs to save room and work with Bacta/DTF, but I left the friggin Beggar in there. It was there for TIEs mainly but nobody was playin that anyway.<br>
<br>
I talk on AIM with this chick back home for a while, which leaves me freakin horny so I cant sleep. I get like three hours then take a much-needed shower .. ;-)<br>
<br>
After donuts and coffee in the lobby and a half-arsed attempt at the Sunday crossword, it’s time to walk over to the Holiday Inn. The tourney gets underway around 11...<br>
<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL GAME DETAIL BEGINS HERE<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
TRM against Drew Scott (1894) Hunt Down walkers<br/>
He starts Crush, IAO and Mob Points. No Epic.<br/>
Let me just preface this game by saying I cant remember the last time I had worse luck in a game of SWCCG. OK.<br/>
No twixes in my opening hand, but I have Mirax so I lose Insight to get Honor, pull the Home1 DBay, drop Honor and Mirax to the H1. Drew loses to Visage.<br/>
He goes, puts Rendili down, and draws. Visage.<br/>
<br/>
I go and activate 6 and dont have a friggin site active. Use Mirax and get crap. Draw for a Jedi Luke. Visage.<br/>
He goes and draws. I Mirax and get crap. Visage.<br/>
<br/>
I activate 6 again and still no site. Put the Bacta Tank out. Whatever.<br/>
He gets Vader out to the Death Star DB and nobody’s losing to Visage.<br/>
<br/>
I drop Jedi Luke to the H1 DBay and I have Anakin’s for him. Still no site. Transit Luke and Mirax to the CC docking bay.<br/>
He comes down with Blizz 2 and DS612 piloting and Evax for fodder, and some other blue card. Trample Mirax, miss. Trample Mirax, got her. Battle Luke, somehow he survives. I think this was the only time in the game I drew a destiny that was even somewhat respectable.<br/>
<br/>
I come down with the only character in my hand, EPP Han. This means two battle destiny, which I’m hoping will cause some damage. But both BD’s are sites. So Han dies and Luke retreats to the Home One.<br/>
<br/>
After a turn of sucking drains I put EPP Obi against Vader (Janus was there too) on the Death Star, I figure he’s got a Put All Sections On Alert but I think if i initate i can swing and hit first then Obi to the Tank should cover battle damage. And if he plays the PASOA before i initiate I’ll just run away or maybe transit Luke over. So I initiate and swing, draw a 1 and a 0. Great. PASOA and I Have You Now are played and Obi dies along with some extra. JK Luke is still on the Home One with his lightsaber up his arse. I finally draw a site.<br/>
<br/>
Another turn of drains, and he sets up at another DBay with Tempest 1 and Igar. I pull Obi out of the Tank but have nowhere to put him. By now I’ve eaten my fair share of drains, and Drew is on 3 bg’s so Visage is kicking my @#$% too. It’s over, and we both know it.<br/>
<br/>
Obi comes back out and he and Luke try to do some fighting but low destiny kicks me in the nuts again and I just can’t take out Vader. I think I TT’ed Visage but it really made no difference. He was way too far ahead of me, and in a deck like Throne Room that’s supposed to get the jump and be ahead, when you fall behind, you’re focked. FL by 22<br/>
<br/>
Hot: uhh...first game loss, maybe ill get to beat on some scrubs now<br/>
<br/>
Not: the WORST luck since i can remember<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
Hunt Down against Rob Parry’s Chadra @#$%s<br/>
He starts AITC, Yarna, and UhOh, and some other junk.<br/>
My opening hand has no Vader which blows because I’m against a deck that gives me enough force for Vader first turn. Mara is there and like a buffoon I put her in the Chamber and pull her Saber. So that’s all my first turn force. I hadn’t activated a Vader either or I would have drawn.<br/>
Of course he puts Bo Shuda out and Kabe and Tessek in the Chamber. I’m soo good at this game.<br/>
<br/>
I move Mara out to the Hutt Trade Route, fully expecting her to be Sandwhirled but not caring. Draw for a Vader.<br/>
He gets the Cantina out along with Bargaining Table.<br/>
I drain at the HTR and it’s cancelled. Put Vader with a saber at the Death Star DBay and Palpy in the Cantina. Flip.<br/>
Ben comes down to the HTR with 3 or 4 Chadra@#$%s, flips me back, and wipes Mara out.<br/>
<br/>
From there it’s all a blur. He went over to the Executor with Boussh and Corran, but CHYBC stopped him from draining there for a while. I guess the game-winning maneuver for him was getting Mos Eisley out .. that was the second BG he needed and with Tessek adding to drains I was hurting. I couldn’t seem to find any characters, with Vader on the Death Star, and Palpy in the Cantina .. I still had Xizor, Jabba, IG, Fett, 4LOM, etc but couldnt draw a damn one. So he drained, I drained, and he retrieved 8 freakin force with Nar Shaddaa .. even had the force to pay for Secret Plans. I got Thrawn in the Chimaera to Carida but I wonder if the force I spent on that and the two cards themselves were even worth the 5 or 6 force in drains that cost him. Cheerio and my two Imp Commands were nowhere to be found. He tried to take out Palpy once but that was ended with a Force Lightning and a tracked 5 in BD. But thanks to Bargaining Table, his objective, and Nar Shaddaa he wins by 5.<br/>
<br/>
Hot: 2 games into the tourney, and already I know I have no shot at the final. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Not: losing to a guy whose rating is over FIVE HUNDRED @#$%ING POINTS lower than mine. I dont know how that happened but I guarantee it will never happen again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I consider dropping but that’s just not practical, what’ll I do, sit around and watch everybody play cards all day?<br/>
Anyhow, I’m standing outside the tourney hall along with everyone else who has finished their games and Ive got my backpack on and everything and this chick who was obviously staying at the HI comes around the corner and she is @#$%ing unbelievably hot. Like supermodel hot, the kind of chick you dont see every day unless youre lucky. This chick looked like Julia Stiles, only better and less @#$%y. Anyway I’m staring at her and we make eye contact and I’m straight up ready to talk to this chick, then I think, "wait a @#$%ing minute .. i’m standing here with a backpack amidst a bunch of @#$%ing gamers .. i’ve got about as much chance with this chick as urkel does with laura winslow .." so i give her a little smile and look away. she licked her lips as she walked by but whatever.<br/>
no offense to card gamers but damn its hard to pick up chicks when you are one.<br/>
<br/>
So i’m 0 and @#$%ing 2 and I know I cant even come close to winning the tourney so I decide it’s just time to have fun. Dean had unfortunately gone 0-2 just like myself, and our diffs were close, so we were afraid we were going to get paired, but fortunately we didnt. We did end up next to each other tho. So we sit down and I’m like "let’s make fun of our opponents" loud enough that they could each hear and Dean’s like "ok"<br/>
<br/>
so we get underway..<br/>
Game 3<br/>
Throne Room against sum yung guy’s dark deal.<br/>
I dunno what to expect against this, i’m thinkin i’ll probly scrub out and lose again.<br/>
he started secret plans of course but i dont remember his three effects. well IAO/Mob Points and something else. I do remember he dropped a Dark Maneuvers/Tallon Roll as he was shuffling but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I actually drew a twix this game but my only farking character was TAWSS KHAA. This is upsetting because as far as I know going to Bespin early is a good idea agaisnt Dark Deal so they cant drop DD too fast with only 3 sites out.<br/>
Look for a dbay and all 6 Jedis are in my RD along with both Leias and both Hans. Funk that. I draw for another site.<br/>
He gets out the system or something, pulled the Executor with Mob Points.<br/>
<br/>
I activate a decent amount and look for a docking bay and there’s still 6 Jedi in there. So I’m acting all pissed off and complaining about how bad i hate swccg and stuff but at least I drew a ship for later on.<br/>
Because of my horrible start he has time to set up .. he doesn’t get DDeal out right away but he does drop the Ex with Occupation and that We’re In Attack Position Now and some commanders down on CC so I am set to lose quite a bit in direct damage. I finally get Jedi Luke out and EPP Leia too and they both have sabers so I have a couple of solid drains set up, but it’s clear I’m going to have to take the system.<br/>
<br/>
So I have the Falcon and EPP Han in hand so I put them at the CC Dockbay with Leia and they take off to the sector. Only during my draw phase do I remember the @#$%ing Tallon Roll I had seen earlier ..<br/>
Luckily he doesnt have it and after another turn of drains I drop the Home One to Bespin and move the Falcon up there. The Falco docks and Han and Leia pilot the Homo One. I had put out Order To Engage earlier too. There’s no other system on table and I doubt he’s playing any so I fear not the Lat Damage.<br/>
He gets yet another turn of direct damage and puts Bossk at the CC Sector and drops Dark Deal. Loses 3 and moves Bossk to the system.<br/>
<br/>
I track some destiny and hit him for quite a bit of attrition at the system. Even with Bossk adding a destiny he doesnt beat my immunity, which is actually boosted by his admiral’s order. I do some creative deploying and moving and cancel DDeal before it can cause me any problems.<br/>
He drain/direct damages me and fights me again at the system, I still have destiny tracked so he loses a whole bunch more to cover battle damage. He had the Ex with one or two pilots agaisnt my Homo One, Han, and Leia drawing a 6 and a 5 in BD so even though he was immune he was taking major battle damage. He loses everyone except the Ex and has nowhere to run.<br/>
I drain him on the ground and finish the Ex off with more tracked destiny. He loses Occupation and the direct damage from his AO. With a little help from On and Off the Edge I boost my diff by a decent amount. But I forget the exact number. FW by something.<br/>
<br/>
Hot: my opponent, for putting up with my harrassing him all game<br/>
<br/>
Not: Occupation and WIAPN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I feel a lot better .. not because I beat on a scrub, but because I enjoyed verbally abusing him during the game. I make amends with him and offer to fight with him out in the parking lot (he was bigger than me and probly would have kicked my ass) but he says he doesnt want to so ok.<br/>
Dean won too and Jim hasn’t lost a game yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 against Shannon Caine WYS<br/>
Holy cow I got paired against a chick.<br/>
She starts WYS and three effects that really do not effect anything, because I have forgotten them. I actually get a Vader in my opening hand and he drops first turn to Docking Bay 94.<br/>
She goes and loses YISYW (ok she started that) for Honor. Draws.<br/>
<br/>
I activate a crapload and get Vader a saber, put Palpy at the Death Star docking bay and say go.<br/>
She shows me Mirax to get the Skate (ok Squassin was a starting effect too) and put them at Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
I put Mara and her saber on the Cloud City docking bay and back Palpy up with Fett (that combined with FLighting is saucy). Drop Search and Destroy. She loses to that and Visage.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the game was me reminding her to lose to S&amp;D and Visage, because she absolutely would NOT lose voluntarily. I guess she thought I might forget one time or something. I quickly ran out of ways to say "lose to S&amp;D and Visage" without sounding like an evil nasty guy so the last few turns of this one were kinda awkward. Eh.<br/>
FW by who cares.<br/>
<br/>
Hot: Shannon<br/>
<br/>
Not: her fiance<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dean and Jim both win again, Dean and I were opposite sides and our diffs are still close so there is still the chance we might get paired against each other .. but we dont. We end up next to each other once again which is cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
Hunt Down again against Jason McSherry (1699) WYS<br/>
WYS blows.<br/>
he starts YISYW, Menace Fades, and uh..Battle Plan?<br/>
First turn Vader is on Dockbay 94. I pull nothing with Mob Points and the Ex dockbay with IAO. The strategy is to force choke.<br/>
He pulls Kessel and TT’s Visage.<br/>
<br/>
Im a genius and I deploy an extra Visage even though he can TT from lost pile. He’s not flipped yet though so it’s a one-card tradeoff as he flips next turn with Mirax/Skate to Tatooine and Talon/Melas to Dockbay 94. I Monnok lost first though and get two JK Lukes which I believe was game-breaker.<br/>
<br/>
Palpy hits the Death Star DBay and Lord Vader and the two smugglers square off. Vader dodges a Portal, Talon is hit, and I draw a 1 for BD. This prompts a slight rulings argument: Melas is immune to attrition less than the number of light side aliens present including himself. This would mean that with Talon present, he is immune to my draw of 1. However since Talon was hit and must be forfeited, I argue that that immunity value changes once Talon is no longer present and the lingering attrition of 1 must be satisfied, which would take Melas out. We call Ted over and despite my well-constructed, intelligent arguments, he rules in Jason’s favor. Bah.<br/>
<br/>
Jason stays flipped and gets free drains of 1 and 1. I lose some crap from hand and Guri off the top. I say "I bet you’re glad to see that go, huh?" Little does he know I had intentionally lost off the top because I have NO ESCAPE in hand.<br/>
I come back down with another Vader and take care of Melas. Drop the No Escape and get Guri. I also have Thrawn and the Chimaera and I plan to get the three of them to the system eventually.<br/>
<br/>
He puts Chewie and an RFC in the Cantina, and an RFC on the Skate too. Bargaining Table is down.<br/>
I drop Mara in the Cantina with a saber and Dr. E/Ponda B. Initiate and he plays Blast the Door Kid so Mara is out. Evazan gets shot but I draw decent BD so the overflow is slight.<br/>
<br/>
He puts two more scrub smugglers in the Cantina and we fight again. Chewie cant hit Mara but she slaps his hairy @#$% and BD leaves one lone RFC holding the Cantina by himself.<br/>
I drop a beating on him to make Jason use the Blast the Door out of his lost pile. He puts some more guys in there but I move Vader in and eventually take control of the Bar. I also get Palpy to the DStar dockbay along with somebody I forget.<br/>
<br/>
So I still have Guri, Thrawn, and the Chimaera waiting to go to the system and it’s becoming apparent that I’m not going to be able to drop them all in one turn as I had originally planned. So I stick Guri at DB 94 alone.<br/>
<br/>
He meanwhile is being force choked like mad; activating 7 a turn mid-late game is not very healthy. I eventually get Chimaera and Thrawn to the system and shuttle Guri up, with that I fulfill Battle Plan and am able to drain for free for the rest of the game. I had Secret Plans and Something Special out but he had no retrieval that I saw so the only thing that slowed his demise was RFC’s on the Bargaining Table. He mounted an attack on Palpy and his bud on the Death Star but Force Lightning and I Have You Now (Han was there) made short work of that.<br/>
FW by teens<br/>
<br/>
Hot: force choking WYS just like I plan to; MONNOK getting two JK Lukes<br/>
<br/>
Not: the destiny in his deck was SICK .. I verified once and saw more 5s and 6s than an episode of sesame street<br/>
<br/>
Jim wins again and is 5-0 but has low differential. Dean took a loss so I wont be sitting next to him again. Dean and I are both hoping Jim wins, even though it would mean we would have to stay for the duel .. I get paired against ..<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
TRM against Joe Gagliardi (2026) Hunt Down Duel<br/>
He starts Epic, Crush, IAO/MP<br/>
This game was like the complete opposite of my first game .. the deck had come full circle. For all the bad luck I had in the first game, I had good luck in this one. This game made me realize just how powerful TRM can be if it gets a decent draw.<br/>
<br/>
So needless to say there was a twix in my opening hand.<br/>
<br/>
Honor was there too, and I drop it, the Twix, and Homo One DB from deck. Lo and behold, in my two force active is another twix. Phatty. I draw for it and Joe loses to Visage.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and draws and loses to Visage.<br/>
I get JK Luke to the H1 DB with a saber. Drop the twix and draw. He loses Shut Him Up or Shut Him Down to Visage and I have the Tank in my hand ;-)<br/>
<br/>
He gets Vader out to a docking bay somewhere without a saber.<br/>
I activate quite a bit, drop the Tank, and transit Luke to a different docking bay. Draw up to 12 and I have no dupes.<br/>
<br/>
He goes, drains me, then Monnoks lost. My hand is sick and he knows it. I have Han, Lando, the Falcon, Obi, Weapon Lev, yadda yadda. He puts Tarkin with Vader and moves in front of Luke. We’re joking around and he doesnt lose to Visage and I miss it. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I put Tawss Khaa down at a dockbay and move Luke to join her. Make him lose to Visage.<br/>
He drops Mara with saber and YABs Luke. Of course I still had the Weapon Lev so that gets cancelled. He sits there for like a minute thinking about it, then duels me. I have nothing, but he has a Focused. He draws a 5, a 1, and a 2, I draw a 6 .... and a 5! Mara bites it and he loses 9.<br/>
<br/>
From there on we just screw around for the most part, I track destiny like a fiend so I wont lose a duel. He tries dueling Luke with Vader but that wasnt even serious. I On The Edge for some cards and win the game when he Counter Assaults my Obi, Tawss, and Lando with one card in his deck ;-)<br/>
FW by 33<br/>
<br/>
Hot: recovering some rating points<br/>
<br/>
Not: I’m still gonna drop like 30 or 40<br/>
<br/>
So Im the first one done between Dean, Jim, and myself .. Dean finishes up shortly after and meets me outside to tell me he won, going 3-3. Unfortunately Jim loses his last game and his differential is not enough to get him into the finals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WRAP-UP<br/>
<br/>
The final standings for all participants can be read in Ted Pancyszyscsscyzcsycszn’s director’s report. I ended up at 8 (+61), a tie for 7th place (huge, i know). Jim was 5-1, but took third because of his low differential.<br/>
Pat Ziagos won the thing, going undefeated on the day (with a timed win). Dan Bordier took second. I’m sure if you look around decktech you can find their decks.<br/>
Prizes were decent, a pack of DS2 for everyone and a random rare from Ted’s surplus collection. Packs of Jedi Knights too, but who cares about that.<br/>
