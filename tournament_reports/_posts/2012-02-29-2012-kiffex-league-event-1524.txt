<blockquote><font class="bfont"> 	This is the first event in Toronto's 2012 league, and my experience with the league last year has encouraged me to write up the events as they go along. Our own Paul Bansal (DarkBro) runs these events, and he always comes up with interesting sidegoals to earn bonus points. Last year I became notorious for SERIOUSLY warping my decks to meet these goals - my mentality being that if I won the bonus points with a subpar deck it would make up for the points I'd miss by not playing a better deck.<br>
<br>
This was most evident during a springtime event in which Paul had decided that, in order to celebrate being able to spend time outdoors, the player who occupied the most exterior sites at any one point would earn two bonus points. I decided to build an ISB Probe Droid Sunsdown deck, and won the goal by deploying to nine sites at once. This required half of the eighteen Probe Droids for which I had cut out v-slips. I even won a game with it, and earned the same number of league points as the guy who came in first (thankfully my light side deck won out).<br>
<br>
I figure if ONE of these events contains a story at least that amusing, it'll be worth chronicling.<br>
<br>
So being encouraged by the muted success of Mistryl at the MPC, I decide to dust off my old Mistryl deck and make the two adjustments I liked most about the MPC version - the substitution of Jabba's Through With You for Blaster Rack, and the potential start of Ability, Ability, Ability non-v with Prepared Defenses (v). Although it would be useless in some matchups, in others it puts HUGE pressure on the LS player to drop SOMETHING to a site, which is exactly what Mistryl wants to see - an unprepared LS character to beat the crap out of. Even if they go to a non-bg, Mara can find them. For my LS, I went with the ol' standby, Communing. Very similar to SoCal Communing with one or two tweaks (for example, I decided to forego We're Leaving for a more directly useful starting card, a decision I would later regret).<br>
<br>
The bonus goal this time around? I'll let Paul explain:<br>
<br>
"Since February is all about spending time with loved ones thanks to Valentines Day and Family Day, any player who plays any of the following cards during any of their games during the event will be awarded 1 bonus point:<br>
<br>
Light Side:<br>
I Know (Endor, Rare)<br>
Rug Hug (Hoth, Rare)<br>
Someone Who Loves You (Jabbas Palace, Uncommon)<br>
This Is Absolutely Right (Endor, Rare)<br>
This Is Even Better (Cloud City, Rare)<br>
This Is More Like It (Dagobah, Rare)<br>
<br>
Dark Side:<br/>
I Am Your Father (Cloud City, Rare)<br/>
One Bright Spot (Virtual Block 6)<br/>
One Beautiful Thing (Virtual Block 6)<br/>
Scruffy Looking Nerf-Herder (Hoth, Rare2)<br/>
This Is Still Wrong (Cloud City, Rare)<br/>
This Is Just Wrong (Hoth, Rare1)"<br/>
<br/>
You were allowed to score one bonus point per side. Being less concerned with theme than efficiency, I lamely decided to go with the destiny-5 used interrupt that uselessly searched my deck for DS (This Is Still Wrong). I was going to use This Is Just Wrong until I reread the card and realized it punished the female, not the male, making it much less useful. For light, what else could I use but Rug Hug?<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - vs. Peter Tenneson's Communing<br/>
<br/>
Peter opts to start the Home One War Room to help get his space set up, but as far as I can tell this lost him the game. He never set up Chewie's gun on the gunrunner, which auto-threepio would have helped with. In any event, I choose to start Jabba's Haven, I've Lost Artoo, and Ability x 3 against him because I feel I can get him to commit guys early when he would rather play reactively.<br/>
<br/>
Which he does. Worried about the damage that's piling up quick - I flipped first turn by pulling A Sith's Plans which got Palpatine's Quarters (meaning I can do 2 with AAA, 2 with my obj, and 2 with the Trophy-enhanced drain) - he puts out Blind Jedi to the Outskirts by himself which costs him most of his force. I have Mara Jade and Aurra Sing in my hand but can only play one of them - because I don't pay Blaster Rack in this deck, and I don't have a Jabba's Through With You for Aurra's stick, I naturally want to play Mara and fetch her stick with her own text, but a quick check of my reserve tells me that's not possible. So instead I drop the cheaper one, battle, and add a battle destiny. Well, not only did I clear the blind dude, Peter draws a 2 for destiny so she's immune and stays. This AFTER Peter checked the top of his deck with BJ (not a great nickname for the old dude I'll admit), saw a one, and got rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
So now I've got two cards with ability on table and Peter would need to drop three in order to cancel AAA. He decides to do so, putting out Tatooine with GLIG1 and Padme, and putting Chewie at the Cantina. He debated for a while whether to put Chewie there or at a non-bg to be safe but went with the battleground to cause damage. Unfortunately all this cost a lot so once again he's not drawing many cards.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of options at this point - I can either try to lay a beat and cause some overflow, or I can use the IG-88 I've got to capture Chewie and take him out of the action permanently - he won't go used, and IG with gun can't be battled when he's by himself. I decide that's the better long-term play so I drop IG-88 and use my obj to peek at the top 2 cards of my reserve, seeing a 1 on top and a 5 below that. I battle, lose the 1 to add a destiny, and capture with the 5. If Peter had the gunrunner set up at this point, that one on top would have borked me - I needed to use an action to get past it, at which point he could have shot me. As it was I didn't have to worry about that, and I retain control of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Peter attempted to wrest a site away from me on a couple more occasions but it always ended poorly for him - I was able to counterbeat twice for a total of seventeen overflow. While he was eventually able to hit IG with Luke's gun and SATM to free Chewie, it was too little too late. At some point I also managed to find TISW for the DS bonus point.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FW (and a bonus point)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - vs. Paul Bansal's ASM<br/>
<br/>
Fairly standard start here, although Paul seemed to be drawing more than I would expect. He seemed to be short on characters. I started Wokling and Commando Training &amp; K'lor'slug, set up Shmi and Threepio, eventually pulling Blind Jedi with the outskirts, because after I move Shmi out to join him I've got Rug Hug set up. Paul flips using Galen, pulling the bodyguard droid. I attempt to beat the crap out of him with my huge luckbox pull of Yoda GW, Chewie Protector and Fallen Jedi, but he Stunning Leaders and because I got greedy I'm one force short of being able to Yoda-cancel it. He reinforces with EPP 4LOM and Garindan(v), but more importantly plays Imperial Justice to limit my destinies. I canceled 4LOM's text in his deploy phase with Chewie, but he decides not to battle and says go.<br/>
<br/>
I played Evac Control(v), stacking some red cards and a Wyron Serper (v). Earlier I had topdecked an EPP Han, so I deployed Seeking (v), used it to grab Han and battled. Chewie canceled Garindan's text, but Han missed the IG droid. 4LOM canceled Yoda's text for the immunity, and Chewie hit the bodyguard. Paul pulled a card off of Justice, so I grabbed the uSerper. After the dust settled I still had Fallen Jedi and Chewie - Han went used and Yoda went on Communing. Paul still had Galen and 4LOM.<br/>
<br/>
On Paul's turn, I believe he added a third guy and battled. He attempted to cancel Fallen Jedi's text with 4LOM but I reminded him she's immune to permanent weapons. Unfortunately, Paul then neglected to pull a card off of Justice, forgetting the Jedi was still adding a destiny against Galen. I drew a five and a six, clearing the site. He hit my Jedi and cleared Chewie to attrition, but neither of them went lost because Communing's kind of silly.<br/>
<br/>
The following turn I flipped Paul back with Chewie and Hero Luke. I now had Rug Hug set up at TWO SITES (tell me that's not better than having One Beautiful Thing set up at two systems). Paul battled Blind Jedi with Maul YA which allowed me to play Rug Hug for my second bonus point. He cleared me, but I Communed into a six on top and got rid of Maul. Soon after this, Paul conceded.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FW (and a bonus point)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - vs. Cole Lepine's Walkers<br/>
<br/>
Man I hate Walkers. There isn't a single thing about this deck that doesn't make me vomit in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Vitriol aside, I decided to start Wokling and Merc Sunlet (v), planning on using Merc to halve the Generator damage. My opening hand contains the uSerper, so Cole has to group Nevar and Veers together, which makes him miss the Generator destiny by 1 next turn. I pull Shmi first turn and move her into the Cantina by herself, because wtf is Cole gonna do about it? Nothin, that's what. Despite my confidence that she'll be safe I make the mistake of backing her up with Hero Luke instead of saving him for later. I also drop the HO:WR first turn, and after soaking up some Walker damage, I go to space before Cole with Verrack(v) and the Home One. I get to drain there one turn before I'm challenged with TatMaul in Infiltrator, and Emperor's Reach in Victory (v). He shuttles up Grand Admiral Thrawn from the planet.<br/>
<br/>
I can't find Ackbar, but I've got Screamin' Lando (v), Chewie, and Yoda GW to get around Maul. I've also got Senator Leia as a passenger. So really this is close to my ideal set-up: I've got three destiny, +2 to attrition, and Cole's destinies are -2. I battle, and Cole plays Imperial Command to limit me to one destiny. I grab it on Strikeforce.<br/>
<br/>
And that's my only response to that.<br/>
<br/>
See, one of my weaknesses is this: when I figure out a way to use a card to get around an opponent's strategy, that's the only thing that card is good for, in my mind. I got so centered on the fact that Yoda GW was getting around Maul that I FORGOT HE COULD CANCEL THE INTERRUPT THAT WAS RUINING MY PERFECT PLAN. So he successfully limits me to one.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he plays Dark Time (v) to prevent Verrack from messing with HIS destinies. No, I didn't remember Yoda at this point either. It would have been a sub-optimal play to cancel Dark Time instead of Command, but I would describe canceling NEITHER as sub-sub-optimal.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, he had a pair of sixes tracked that forced my to lose Yoda to Communing and Chewie to used. They exactly covered attrition (since his two sixes add up to fourteen in Walkers), but this had the benefit of preventing Cole from attacking me since without Yoda I had no presence. I decided it was better to let him go and take the damage, rather than allowing Cole to potentially knock me out of space entirely.<br/>
<br/>
So Cole drained, added Space Vader and Piett as pilots, pulled Igar with Piett and put him on the ground. Next turn I'm at it again, this time with Blind Jedi as my way around Maul. He plays his third copy of Command to prevent me from doing much of anything, plays Walker Garrison on his next turn, and I scoop.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FL<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - vs. Matt HT's TRM<br/>
<br/>
I once again chose to start AAA. TRM's the best deck to do so against - not only are you forcing them to play actively instead of reactively, there's a solid chance that they won't be able to find a battleground for a while. If you're smart you won't give them one. They can either choose to lose 2 force per turn, or drop a guy to a non-bg where they're wasted.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, even though I did make him topdeck two cards turn one (since who the hell can you deploy in TRM for three force), he was able to grab the Battle Plains and drop Mace there. I was able to throw Aurra with a trophy on her and made him lose four force in overflow, but Mace stuck around and at this point I was kind of regretting not playing Blaster Rack - I had no JTWY and no Mara (in fact, Aurra and 4LOM were the only characters I had). Mace got reinforced with SITF Luke next turn, canceling AAA.<br/>
<br/>
Lamentably that one copy of Aurra was pretty much the only character I saw for the next thirty minutes. I wasn't comfortable moving Shada out to flip for the vast majority of this game since I couldn't provide her with backup, but this kept being a problem because there were several times I could have reeeeeeeally used an alien from my lost pile, but couldn't get two battlegrounds to satisfy STaN.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, had I been able to do so, I could have pulled off an awesome combo. I could have dropped Aurra (non-v) in front of Mace and Luke, deployed Mara to Boss Nass' chambers with a Trophy, moved her over, Vader's Obsession Luke, and have Aurra steal Luke's saber once he went lost. Unfortunately this wasn't possible, so instead I just VO'd Luke, caused four force loss (but couldn't retrieve since I didn't have two battlegrounds), and then Evacuated Mara to prevent her getting crushed by reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
So Matt retained control of the Battle Plains, but he didn't have many cards in hand so I decided to get more ballsy elsewhere. I dropped the Cantina and put Mara with her saber there, and moved Shada out to Palpatine's Quarters, briefly flipping. At this point Matt had Home One up at Nal Hutta so he was draining for free. He attacked Shada with EPP Obi and cleared Shada, who drew a five for destiny. This meant I had a five and a six - the Trophy Shada was carrying - at the bottom of my deck on my turn. At this point I've got Zuckuss in Mist Hunter in my hand, and with an eleven on the bottom of my deck the little bastard really wanted a crack at Home One (which had Ackbar and Threepio on it, total forfeit of ten).<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, Shada was dead. I had a backup in my hand, but was one force shy of being able to drop her AND Zuckuss AND battle. Instead I drained with Mara and put Aurra with saber at Coruscant, trying to keep the damage comparable. Despite being characterless and kind of impotent for a large portion of this game, I've made Matt commit a lot of resources to staying in control of the board so we're fairly close in life force. However, Matt is able to clear me off of Coruscant again and I'm not able to match his drains.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FL<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - vs. Bye<br/>
<br/>
Not much to say here, except that it sucks having an odd number of players at a local like this - with nine players and six games, two thirds of the field gets a bye. But the only other option is asking the director to sit out entirely and that's bs if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FW (duh)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - vs. Peter Tenneson's HD(v)<br/>
<br/>
Peter's 2-3, but in a three round local with nine players you're going to get unevenly paired at some point. Peter started the Lego Vader epic event, GotM and a third thing that was probably Ni Chuba (v). I started Wokling and Commando Slug again, and this was the game I was made to pay for not using We're Leaving. First turn, Peter throws down the 3/2 site from hand and drops Emperor Palpatine there for some early pressure. I set up Shmi and Threepio as usual and use Wokling to pull the greatest Communing card that no one else seems to use - Advantage (v). Peter drains for two and draws, seemingly unable to find a Vader or Galen.<br/>
<br/>
I play Draw Their Fire and attack the Emperor at the 3/2 with Hero Luke, because he's so ridiculous that I am guaranteed to clear Empy. Peter decides not to blind Force Lightning Luke, and Luke shoots at the Emperor just to clear his immunity. Except, of course, that I drew a blind six and actually HIT the old bastard. So thanks to Advantage, Peter's total power there is now zero. He draws a three for destiny and I draw a five, meaning Palpatine's adjusted forfeit is exactly enough to cover battle damage. Luke is technically immune to Peter's attrition, but I voluntarily forfeit him to used to avoid being counterbeat. Hell, I'm playing Communing, what do I care if I lose one character? I'll see him again eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the pro play that explains why I should have been playing We're Leaving: Peter drops Lego Vader to my Outskirts, fetching him his saber from reserve. He then plays Vader's Mask from the epic event, and cancels it to move Vader in front of Shmi during his battle phase! I didn't even know that was a thing. So now I'm boned. He battles and swings his saber at dear old ma. But he must still have some feelings for her because he draws TWO ONES and misses her. He gets a six for battle destiny which turns into a five, so I have to lose Shmi and five to overflow, but I'm just happy it wasn't TEN to overflow like it should have been.<br/>
<br/>
I'm ready to take some revenge, however. I play Down With the Emperor (v) - a card I love in this deck but I'm not quite sure is worth the slot - drop Hero Luke and Chewie on Vader and play Rug Hug for two extra battle destiny. I'm unable to hit Vader but his immunity is gone thanks to the gun and I can still overflow him if my destinies are high enough - but instead of being agreeable my deck decides to draw one, one, two for battle destiny. Vader hit one of my guys so both are cleared and I lose two force, but I won the battle AND made Peter lose a Dark Jedi so he had to lose 2 force to DWTE(v).<br/>
<br/>
Now here comes the truly ridiculous part of this game. Peter manages to replace Vader at the Outskirts, giving him the Mask again (meaning he's plus 2 power and immune to attrition while defending at one of my sites). He also throws down Emperor Palpatine and Dr E combo, meaning his total power is now 18.<br/>
<br/>
I need to deal with this, so I drop EPP Han and Luke. Peter plays nothing after I drop Han, but when Luke joins the party he Force Lightnings Han successfully. So Luke is staring down two Dark Jedi, an unlicensed surgeon and his assfaced friend. Does he run away from this bevy of powerful Dark Side characters?<br/>
<br/>
No, because Hero Luke is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
I initiate battle. Having Communed earlier in the turn, I knew a six was on top of my deck so I shot Vader in the face. The Emperor had lost his immunity already by zapping Han, so when it was Luke's turn again he shot Dr E and Ponda B in their respective faces. He no longer had his forfeit, because Vader swung at him and unfortunately I didn't have a copy of RLR(v) at this point, but because of Advantage I now had 4 power to Peter's 10, each of us getting one battle destiny. I believe we drew fairly evenly, meaning if I still had Luke's forfeit I wouldn't have taken overflow from this battle in which Peter had more than FOUR TIMES my total power initially. As it was I just Houjixed the damage, lost two to Peter's objective and cleared the site. Worth it. Oh, and Peter got to play I Am Your Father (v) for a bonus point, but it went used when Vader died.<br/>
<br/>
So by now we're fairly close in life totals, since I've been able to abuse Use The Force's retrieval - Peter can't grab it or I'll abuse RLR the entire game. This allows me to recover from Peter's Shmi beat, bringing us pretty close in life force. Neither of us particularly want to commit forces to the ground, because the attacker gets a chance to overflow AND gets the benefits of Draw Their Fire. By now I've put Tantive by itself at Tatooine, having verified Peter's deck and seen two things: first, that he doesn't play space, and second, that he DOES play Program Trap(v) so if I want a battleground system, Tatooine's the only safe bet.<br/>
<br/>
Peter tentatively puts Galen at the 3/2 site knowing he'll retain his forfeit, but I just clear him with Chewie since I get the first opportunity to fire my gun. I hit Galen, and Peter elects to hit Chewie and end the battle. Didn't really matter though, either way Galen was going lost and Chewie was going used with no overflow on either side.<br/>
<br/>
Peter put Cyborg at the City Outskirts, realizing that the 3/2 site works against him when I'm the attacker. Cyborg had his new saber which vaguely worried me, but I still had a RLR in my hand and Peter hadn't had a chance to grab it yet. I track Chewie around and take out Cyborg, canceling the swing. Peter chooses NOT to draw battle destiny since Cyborg's forfeit covers damage, and this makes me worry about a counterbeat.<br/>
<br/>
So I quickly figure out a plan to protect myself - the Houjix I'd played earlier is now, thanks to DTF and UTF retrieval, on top of my lost pile. My reserve deck is empty, so I play UTF to retrieve Houjix, recirculate, use Threepio to pull UTF back into hand, and play UTF to get Houjix and the card I paid to retrieve it from the top of my deck. Turns out it wasn't really necessary though as all that comes at me the next turn is Galen with his stick - Peter had simply found First Strike the turn before and wanted to be the attacker this time. I lost two to that but he was unable to retrieve as he didn't have a second bg. The site was cleared and time was called on my turn - I had 16 left, and he had 10, and he also acknowledged that he was done anyway since he was down to his last two characters, both of which were buried in his reserve.<br/>
<br/>
RESULT: FW<br/>
<br/>
Before I finish, I have to mention one thing. During my third or fourth game, I overhear something like "watch out when playing against Phil, he's got like 47 Vader's Obsessions in his deck." I assume he's playing HDv or Mistryl like I am and is playing 5 copies or so to COMPLETELY lock out any chance of Luke sticking around, but after I finish my game I go over to his table and people are flipping through his deck - he LITERALLY was playing with FORTY SEVEN COPIES of Vader's Obsession. He had three other cards in his deck: Choke Vader, Emperor Palpatine, and Elis Helrot. Oh, and the Death Star he used as his starting (and only) location. He plans to teleport adjacent to Luke, move over and draw two sixes for Vader's Obsession. This is his whole deck.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't win until game six, when he got matched up against Tim's lightsaber combat deck. Tim conceded because there's only so many times you can win combat against two autosixes, and it ain't like he was causing damage anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
So in the end I was 4-2, as were Matt HT and Thomas Graham. Cole finished undefeated, winning himself a gift card for the store we play in. I'm not entirely sure about the Strength of Schedule calculations, but I'm reasonably certain that Matt came in second and I came in third. If memory serves, Cole got both his bonus points but Matt got none or one - which would put Cole two points ahead of me, and Matt either tied with me or one point behind. <br/>
<br/>
We're off to the races. It's gonna be interesting.<br/>
