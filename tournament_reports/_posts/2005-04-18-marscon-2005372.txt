<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Jarrett McBride; MarsCon 2005 Winner's Report<br>
(This is for DBZ CCG)<br>
By Jarrett McBride<br>
<br>
It all starts on the plane ride Friday afternoon. Justin and I were going through the metal detectors and randomly they think I'm a terrorist...so I get held back and fingerprinted etc. I mean, maybe I could be mistaken for being in the mafia...but a terrorist??? Oh well. It didn't delay me. After an hour and a half flight, we finnally arrive to the airport and we wait about an hour for the shuttle from our hotel arrive. After getting things settled down in our rooms, Justin and myself finally get to the con.<br>
<br>
At the con we do a little bit of Inuyasha Trading for things that Justin needs for his deck and randomly I get to trade a Halt for a Miroku Secret Rare...so it made the day. This card, in turn, became my scouter for the weekend...since I don't have anything else that's interesting/stupid to use. After trading and meeting up with people, we leave somewhat early and Justin and I do a few night before tweaking. I finally go to bed at around 1 PM and I get a great deal of sleep...for being at a con. Then we head to the tournament and here is where my actual report comes in to play.<br>
<br>
I was playing Orange MBS Supreme West Kai / Orange Vegeta's Assault (OVA).<br>
<br>
Note - I cannot rememberevery person's name so if you know if we played a match and want your name included, contact me.<br>
<br>
Round 1 - VS. Saiyan Tactical Brolly<br>
Well, I start first because I am a hero. I draw various useless drills. He enters with a few decent cards in hands (like catching me with a Power Punch or Saiyan Power Beam) but eventually I get enough drills to OVA him to death.<br>
<br>
1-0<br>
<br>
Round 2 - VS. Orange Technique Hercule<br>
He starts with Orange Defensive Drill in play. He starts first. He plays down Bulma and Chi-Chi as allies. I pull decent drills and an early OVA which I hold on to pretty much the entire game until the end. This game was fast as I OVA with the right amount and the right drills.<br>
<br>
2-0<br>
<br>
Round 3 - VS. Black Energetic Goku played by Justin McBride<br>
<br>
Wow...I play Justin. Oh well.<br>
<br>
I basically knew I had this match in the bag through all the playtesting we did, but whenever I play against Justin in a tournament I always lose even though I win in playtesting. He goes first. Well this game I basically kept getting hurt pretty badly early on except I finally got a decent hand with Hercule's Crescent Punch and I entered with that. Then from there the game went down hill for him as I kept getting HCP back. Probablly my second hardest game as luck was going bad on my side but I finally pulled an OVA and shut him down.<br>
<br>
3-0<br>
<br>
Round 4 - VS. Saiyan CS Goku<br>
<br>
I hate playing against Saiyan. I'm sick of Power Beam / Power Punch and they both should be limit 1 and restricted. Anyways, I go second. He keeps Power Punching / Beaming when I get terrible hands against the cards but I eventually OVA him to death.<br/>
<br/>
4-0<br/>
<br/>
Round 5 - VS. Secret Tech Orange MBS Roshi played by Kyle McGrath<br/>
<br/>
This is our evently match. <br/>
<br/>
He starts first. pulls some setups. Passes. I pull Long Journey and a COGD first hand. I use them. He plays a few balls down and I eventually  play "Huh???" against him and kill one. I basically get set up to where he can't do anything else, but he plays a Pan's Stalwart Faceslap against me and gets my good cards.This screwed me up bad..yet he gives me a n Orange Drill when he did that. I was puzzled. He OVA's. I'm screwed. He names correct. I use my mastery for Focusing and Haulting Drill. This saves me a great deal. He eventually gets me to discard it Haluting Drill and he eventually OVA's me again, but since I'm SWK I always get cards back and I kept getting Orange Haulting Drill back due to mastery. I eventually OVA him to where he has like 15 cards left compared to my 40 something and and I eventually play a COGD naming OVA. Then I kill him off with Goku's Power Strike's until time is called and I win by one life. Close game but I finally got my rematch.<br/>
<br/>
5-0<br/>
<br/>
Round 6 - VS. Secret Tech Orange MBS Roshi played by Phil McGrath<br/>
<br/>
He starts first and gets a first turn Long Journey. I'm done for basically as he starts getting amazing balls / board but I eventually play "Huh???" against him but he eventually kills my Orange haulting Drill and does an OVA for like 18 or some random number thanks to three Krillin's Power Tap on a +4 drill. <br/>
<br/>
Overall his deck was played well and either him or Kyle should have done better then they did. Bad luck I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Overall 5-1 before making Top 16<br/>
<br/>
Here is where the real fun begins.<br/>
<br/>
T16 - VS. Justin McBride<br/>
<br/>
He gets D.Q'd for not having a NEA on his deck list. But either way, if we played it or not, we know I would have won =D.<br/>
<br/>
T8 - VS. Orange Pinpoint Pan played by TheLastDerivative<br/>
<br/>
I was actually fearing this matchup. The day before we played a pickup game and he killed me. Well he starts first. He enters combat on me. He plays Black Scout Maneuver naming OVA. He hits it but only two. Well, this kind of screws him up as I have a few attacks that grab drills in my hand so I use them. I then start getting set up to play OVA from my sensei deck but then my plans change. I couldn't depend on having my final attack canceled by an event stopper, so I decide to abuse Super Android 17's Ki Intensity. So I go for it...but he stops that idea with his NEA. Then he tries killing me but names odd/even wrong most of the game. then basically I just kill him using Hercule's Crescent Punches and Power Strikes from level 2 and I ventually got a decent setup to where they were doing a lot of damage. I randomly had a Speaking with the King Drill in play and I pulled S17's KI Intensity. This won me the game. He got me down to about 20 something cards...but it just wasn't enough. A very good game. Too bad we had to play each other to see who gets money prizes.<br/>
<br/>
T4 - VS. Black Energetic Goku played by TSFroggy<br/>
<br/>
He starts first and enters, I draw random first turn Long Journey in a combat, but he uses confrontation to kill it.  Then I basically get beat down a bit but an he gets to level 2, and sends me to level 2. I'm slowing the beats down then I get decent setup enough to where I can play HCP and OVA, so I was set. I steal a ball and I get uber hand size. Then I get like so many drills in play and OVA him. Very good game. I'm glad that my moderators on the site have gone so far. It just shows how good our staff actually is.<br/>
<br/>
FINALS - VS. Saiyan CS Goku played by DFG<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
<br/>
I start second. He first turn enters with Black Scout maneuver and names OVA. He kills my two in deck. Alright, well I will have to try it the HARD way. Basically that game, he random beats me and I actually take alot of the damage. Unknown to him I have the uber victory condition known as Super 17's Ki Intensity.<br/>
<br/>
I get to level three and basically for the remainder of that game I keep abusing Your Wish Has Been Granted and Super 17's Ki Intensity. I played YWHBG twice that game on him and the S17's four times. I then get an OVA setup but I don't draw my Hercule's Amazing Techniques to OVA ever so instead I draw Gohan's Kick and a HCP and kill him with those.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - Win!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
This game was actually pretty bad for him as I got board set up very quickly and I played S17's Ki Intensity first turn on him. He makes a big deal of removing my Ki Intensity from the game as he wastes Black Star 5 on it...well I eventually setup Ultimate Board Control and I OVA for game and kill him with that.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - WIN!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Overall this entire tournament I went 10-1 and won $1000. So it was worth the trip.  <br/>
