<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Part II:   Attack of the Clowns<br>
<br>
It is a dark time for our weary travellers, but at 8:15am with the door half-open, we are wakened by the sound of Bill’s torrential morning pee.  We are reminded of why we are here and start to wake up.  At this point, Greg decides to change his dark deck AGAIN and starts mooching more cards (basically cannibalizes my unused DS Combat deck).  I call Blythe and leave a message for directions to Dark Tower Games, and she calls back about 30 minutes later to guide me there.  As we shower and flip through lame TV (church shows, Teletubbies, soul train, some war movie, and the weather channel), things are getting packed and by 9:30am we are ready to roll except that Forrest Gump started on HBO and we got sucked into that.  We did manage to break the hypnotic trance and get out by 9:45. <br>
<br>
We forego stopping for breakfast and go right to Dark Tower games where we find Lingrell, Terwilligers and 6 other Albanities (including a rare appearance of Jon Chu), A rare appearance by the Syracuse players (Paterniti and a couple of Schultz’s), Praskac, some local players, and many whom I didn’t recognize.  I spend some time with Rich Haman who looks completely different since he left law enforcement and went back to school for IT.  Ziagos, Gagliardi, and Walsh arrive.  Since my decks were listed Blythe checks mine first and I split for some take-out breakfast from across the plaza. When I return I sit down and get caught up with Syracuse, but Blythe and Tom are still checking decks until about 11:15 or so.  I was a little skeptical that this would delay the tournament, but their persistence to not have to DQ anyone pays off and the 6 games are done in less than 7 hours.  The first pairing is Pat Ziagos and Chris Praskac and away we go.<br>
<br>
I am still playing the same decks as yesterday:  LS Combat; DS Black Sun AAT/Droidekas.  My goal is to go 3-3 at this event since I have not kept in mental shape other than going to a tournament once per month.  This will play instrumental throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Game 1:  My LS v. Chad Samuels’ Deal Getting Worse/Mains &amp; Beats<br>
<br>
He deploys Executor to Bespin and pretty much owns that force drain the entire game.  I get Jedi Luke with LS to Cloud City, so we exchange drains for another turn.  He pops down the Emperor’s Shield to Cloud City, and I respond with UberFalcon (Han,Chewie,Falcon) and spank him with 11 additional force after he forfeits them.  Next turn he deploy’s Maul to Luke’s location, and I "It Can Wait" him.  There is a brief discussion about how this card has been errata’d, and his next turn he decides to go to Naboo with his mains.  I pop Boushh down to block one drain, then get Obi Wan, JK with a 7 under him and start a combat hoping my destiny is decent.  I pop Maul pretty good and he goes away to the lost pile.  With DLOTS and GM Tarkin next door, two turns later, I sneak over and pop Vader with a pair of 7’s under Obi.  My objective flips back and I basically drain him out for the win.  Game Breaker:  It Can Wait.  Full win by 19.<br>
<br>
2(19)<br>
<br>
A pleasant surprise to take a first win.  Of course, you can’s successfully swim the sea of jizz with a first turn win, so the rest of the day suffers.  Praskac, Terwilliger, and Chu are names listed near the top.  I continue...<br>
<br>
Game 2:  My DS v. Mike Gemme’s LS Combat<br>
<br>
I’ve never met Mike, but I know he is active on Decktech and well known in the swccg community.  He is a very serious and consciencious player.  During the whole game he is laughing politely at my really bad jokes.  I (always)flip to Vengeance first turn with Xizor at the Coruscant Docking Bay.  He starts the race and basically rolls over me 30-7 in about 3 turns (I elected to take the loss and return some destiny draws to my used pile).  I lose the 6 cards, including my Palpi and Naboo Docking Bay, which screws me for the rest of the game.  He deploys QuiGon to the Generator, and I deploy Iggy with gun there and an Imperial Artillery to Colo, hoping to nab him.  He plays "It’s a Trap", which I grab, and his next turn he uses the damned objective text to make Iggy go away (you’ll find I forgot that text about 3 times today..).  At one point he Free Ride’s me and looks at my Res Luk Rauf then shows Brian Twigg, who is sitting next to us.  I jokingly try to get him DQ’d for showing my cards, which managed to get another...polite...  smile out of him.  He gets out R3 Leia, Jedi Luke, and YoMaFo (r3 Yoda) to Naboo and basically he clobbers me with the drain.  He gets UberFalcon to my Kiffex to nullify my Battle Order, and I can’t pay to drain and deploy.  I did manage to get my AAT’s and boomahs (Energy Shell Launchers) and he wisely elected to not go there.  Full Loss by 30.<br>
<br>
2(-11)<br>
<br>
OK... Maybe this is the diving board into the sea that I needed.  We shall see.  I talked to Mike afterwards and we got a slice of pizza and was able to really see him without his "game face."  This guy is a class act.<br>
<br>
Game 3:  DS v. Aaron Northrup’s Palace Raiders<br>
<br>
What a game!!  Picture a bunch of rogue aliens on skiffs trying to fight the Trade Federation’s finest on Tatooine.  He shows Kabe as his rep then works his MoJo at the Audience Chamber.  I of course flip first turn and we start deploying lots of stuff to Tatooine.  He sets up a drain of 3 at the Cantina and 2 at the Cantina, but I own the Hutt Pass or whatever that is.  I drop Battle Order and ZiMH to Coruscant and later get Bossk in Bus to my Kiffex.  He has no space so he has to think through paying to drain and deploy.  We have about 3-4 huge multiple destiny adder battles, but the biggest one was after I had moved 4LOM with gun AND Program Trap to Cantina (he has EPP Obi and 2 other guys there).  I stack a 4 on Colo, then proceed to initiate against a loaded skiff.  Another skiff reacts over and I start shooting.  I target a skiff, draw a 2, switch it with the 4, thus hitting the skiff and killing the Cantina occupants.  I then target EPP QuiGon, draw another destiny, which I think was really high, and swap it with the 2 on Colo, thus hitting QuiGon.  We do the math and basically our battles become less and less dramatic, but He can’t keep up with the boomahs and droidekas (direct damage) targeting his raiders and chadra-fan.   A close one!!  Full win by 5<br>
<br>
4(-6)<br>
<br>
OK..  I am one win away from my .500 weekend.  I am pleased with my success so far.  Again the time between games is no more than 10 minutes and Tom shouts out the pairings.  Gemme, Praskac, Twiggs, Chu..   all still at the top table.  A surprise is in store for me, though..<br>
<br/>
Game 4:  LS v. Rich Haman’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Rich now has a full head of hair, a goatee, a daughter, and he is no longer a cop.  I’m out of it for a while and look at this!!  He sets up Palpi and Janus to the throne room with all the needed accessories and they have their little love-in there the whole game.  He pop’s Executor and Thrawn to Tatooine system (and he can have it!!).  We start deploying guys to Naboo (I did bounce EPP Maul back to his hand, which was cool) and I manage to stack a 7 under QuiGon and draw a frikkin 1 against his 2-5’s.  I lost!!  beleive it or not, that was the start of my bad luck.  I did manage to get him next turn, though, with a 7 and 6 underneath.  He deploys Big Bad Fett and Mara with Stick to Naboo, then brings GM Tarkin and Lord Vader down.  I deploy Young Jedi Obi and he frikkin Circle’s him (bad luck part 2). I managed to OOC Vader’s Saber and some red cards, but early on I had the opportunity to OOC with just Vader, his stick, EPP Maul, and his starting interrupt and I didn’t (totally lazy brain on my part). Jedi’s Resilience saved EPP Luke 2 times so I could try to get some kind of  drain or offensive going, but my own Battle Plan screwed me in the long run.  Full loss by 3.<br/>
<br/>
4(-9)<br/>
<br/>
This was a great time.  This is what the game is about.  ’nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  LS v. Mike Robinson’s Big Blue ISB <br/>
<br/>
This game was interesting.  There were no big battles, and once again, Battle Plan and lazy brain made the difference.  I set my stuff up on Naboo, he stays in space.  I get UberFalcon to Fondor (he’s elsewhere paying to drain for 2) and try to chase down a lone Devastator.  His next turn he has only a few cards in hand, so he deploys Chimera, which I bounce, then he scurries away, leaving me to my lonesome.  He’s got RA7 down on Naboo, so my drains are only 1 each in 3 places (his Spaceport Docking Bay with my Jedi Luke and Saber).  I deploy an Intruder Missle on the Falcon, R2 in Red 5 is sitting on Colo, and I move to Fondor where his lone Devastator awaits.  i know he is somewhat limited in his actions, and I am expecting 1-2 drains of 2 and the Chimera, but I want to fire my missle and lob an "Out of Nowhere" on him.  In my excitement I forgot to pay upkeep and he politely reminds me after I recycle.  If I had remembered, I could have done it, or I could have Blue Milk’d to get a 3rd force to spend for upkeep.  Totally my bad and it cost me the game.  We spend the next 4 turns spending to drain and I end up on the short end of the deal.  Full loss by 4.<br/>
<br/>
4(-13)<br/>
<br/>
..and I’m spent.  I was kicking myself every which way for that nonsense.  I wanna go home, but there is one more  game to go.  Praskac is 5-0 and a lot of good people are 4-1.  (you’ve seen those names already).  Pairings are given and I’m playing....<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  DS v. Mike Robinson’s LS Combat.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I basically threaten to sing "Mrs Robinson" for the whole bloody game (for those of you old enough to know the song).  I am still reeling from the emotional defeat he gave me but I am looking forward to how I can wreck his day and salvage a 3-3 afternoon.  He seems perplexed by whatever I’m trying to do, and we had a few good battles at Naboo Docking Bay and a few inside the Generator areas.  At some point he deploys UberFalcon to my Kiffex (WTF is up with that?).  I deploy ZiMH and Bossk in Buss and he retreats to Corsucant.  I did manage to have Program Trap 4Lom with gun Disarm Young Jedi Obi, which he thought was pretty lame.  After a few chase and avoid turns, I had AAT with Tank Commander, Assault Leader with OOM-9, booby trapped 4lom vs. Qui Gon and YoMaFo at the Docking bay.  I target QuiGon, hitting him of course, and he draws a 5 destiny.  BOO-YAAAAAA!!!!   Destiny = # of charaters at site:  DEATH TO JEDI!!!!  My AAT’s are quite safe.  He didn’t like that too much and the battle is over.  So this Lando with Attitude comes down against Xizor, Guri, and some droidekas somewhere in the generators and I realized why Guri is Tech against hyper Lando.  We lose a few guys then he moves Lando, pays his upkeep and guess what he forgot to do:   PAYBACK IS A BEEEEE-ATCH and SO AM I!!!  Na Na Na Na, hey hey hey, GOOD-BYE FALCON!!!!  I then continue to engage him on the ground and spread out in space.  Through ongoing deploying of characters in the core, he basically outlasts me there and although I dont have to pay for any drains, he has enough to pay for his 2 drains of 2 for a few turns and I can’t move my AAT’s into the generators (this is a serious weakness between combat and QMC...).  I was nailing him for 3 in space and 1 at the docking bay, but he outlasts me again.  Full loss by 4.<br/>
<br/>
4(-17)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 is done by 6:20pm, which is less than 7 hours from poke to pop.  Wow..  what can I say?  All in all a fun, successful, weekend.  If you flip those 3 close losses I am 5-1.  After game 6, which Praskac loses, Mike Gemme is #1 and Jon Chu is #2.  <br/>
<br/>
Greg and Bill each finished 4-2 for the day, 8-5 for the weekend (including LotR);  Drew finished 3-3 today, 9-3 for the weekend; Jon finished 2-4 (with postive diff) and 4-8 for the weekend.  Me?  I was 5-7 this weekend with 4 very close games that could have gone either way (1 win and 3 losses) had I been more or less careful.  <br/>
<br/>
We stayed for only a few more minutes to say goodbye’s, trade, return borrowed cards, and plan out the next few weeks of playing to get ready for Origins.  The ride home was fairly quiet, but we stopped for cheesesteaks on the way and in less than 36 hours, Bill, Jon, and Greg were home.  I get Drew back to the rendezvous point at about 940pm and 10 minutes later I’m home to rethink my life.<br/>
<br/>
