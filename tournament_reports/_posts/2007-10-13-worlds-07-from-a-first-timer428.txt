<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Ah, Worlds.  Never thought I'd really get there one day, since my card collection is small and I'm fairly poor.  Due to the generosity of my fellow Texans I've been able to get ahold of various vital cards I had been missing for years (*cough* STARTING EFFECTS *cough*), and things seemed to come together this year for me.  I had never won any tournaments before (though I've never been bad, never below .500), but managed to win 3 this year, including OK States.  My collection is still limited, and probably the smallest of anyone that made it to Worlds (such as... I've never opened a pack of Coruscant or Reflections 3), but I'm not stupid, so I tend to win by solidarity and playing decks that don't require the best cards.  I thought about various new decks I could've tried at Worlds, but due to work I didn't really have much time to put any effort into it, so I just brought my existing decks with me, most of which are janky (DBO and MBO for example), but I had experience with them, and they have good matchups against the more popular decks.<br>
<br>
My DBO is your basic Nudj/Goo Nee Tay choke version.  I used to start Your Insight Serves You Well to pull either Menace Fades or Honor of the Jedi, whichever I needed most, but any deck where HotJ would be good had No Escapes, so I ditched it and started Menace Fades every game.  This turned out to be a pretty good plan, since 3rd turn I was more or less guaranteed to flip, grab either Hoth or Endor (with Rieekan or Mothma) and put 1-2 squadrons there, thereby canceling their drain bonuses AND making them -1, killing most of their damage potential.  I lost maybe 15-18 force to drains in 4 games.  My Endor Ops has been posted on decktech twice and hasn't really changed much.  It doesn't have many true auto-wins, but plays pretty solid against nearly everything, with autolosses to decks I figured (correctly) no one would play.  The V-14 preview cards only helped it, and I have a feeling the full set will help it even more.<br>
<br>
My boss was nice enough to let me have 6 days off so I could be there Wednesday thru Monday and have time to chill (never been to Chicago).  Michael came in later on Wednesday night, we played some Guitar Hero, and went to bed relatively early.<br>
<br>
We happened to meet Dave McCune on the bus Thursday morning on our way to the Sealed event, and got to talk to him quite a bit over the weekend, but especially that morning since the store owner completely forgot we were having a tournament and didn't show up until about 90 minutes after we were supposed to start.  We eventually get inside and call our last teammate Thomas, who arrived that morning, to direct him from the airport to the store.  In total there were only 6 of us, Dave, Nate the Intern, and the 4 of us, and since we had byes, and top light and top dark got byes into Day 2, both Dave and Nate automatically had their byes just from participating, no matter what happened.  <br>
<br>
Mike, Dave and I were dark, with JW, Thomas and Nate playing light, and since there were only 6 of us, we only played 3 games.  We each opened 3 packs of Reflections 1, plus 4 of Cloud City I think, and switched cards with our opponent (originally it was going to be a booster draft, but that works better with larger groups).  I ended up with 2 Landos (1 foil, 1 non), 2 Rancors (1 foil, 1 non), Malakili, Blizzard Scout 1, Obsidian 7, Den of Thieves, and not much else that was helpful (Epic Duel, Despair, Punishing One foil with no available pilots, etc.).  First game against JW I actually did get the Malakili+Rancor combo down and he ate a few people, but didn't really help me much, and I lost by 1 because of his Baragwin.  2nd game against Nate I had Den of Thieves in my starting hand, and thus I saved myself about 15 force, and won by 2.  3rd game against Thomas he had his own Lando out before I could get mine, because I deployed the Security Tower first turn, did the once per game search, and both were in my force pile of 5, and since I had NO other cards with ability &gt;1, I had to over-deploy to hold anything, so I lost by 3.  Sadly my 2 losses were the only suffered by the dark side, as Mike and Dave went 3-0, but meh, we had fun.  The previous night we had thrown together the biggest Endor/DS2 pile we could make for Michael to play in the Endor/DS2 tourney, and he ended up winning that too (his LS was an Ewok deck Thomas made for him), but the rest of us just kinda hung out and playtested.<br>
<br>
Since Blake Huffman decided last minute not to come, Michael took JW as his partner for the team tournament, so Thomas and I paired up.  I didn't really care which side I played, so Thomas picked light, leaving me to pick a dark side (I would've played MBO if I was light; from what I've seen only JW, who copied my Endor Ops deck, was playing any of the 4 objectives I brought).  Since I didn't want to "reveal" my Endor Ops early (even though I posted it on decktech, twice), and I don't have the cards to build multiple decks using a lot of the same stuff, I decided to go with an old favorite, MKOS.  The last time I played it was TX States 2005, where it went 2-2, with both losses (one in the semifinals) coming against broken WYS (V), so basically it would lose to decks that ignored it or avoided it, even though it more or less avoided everyone else too.  It has some decent matchups, mostly against LS mains, having 30-32 characters or so, while also having the Gailid+Rodian (V)+Bane Malar (V)+Hutt Influence combo to get an unmodifiable, uncancelable drain of 6 (and the bonuses at 2 of the sites can't be canceled, 3 if I put Ree-Yees in there, which I took out to put another Boba BH in there).  The standard start uses Twi'lek Advisor (V) for Power of the Hutt, Desilijic Tattoo (V), and Den of the Thieves non-v (there are 6 non-uniques in the deck, and with retrieving and/or recycling Abyssins it's relatively easy to find one), though I'd switch Den of Thieves for Hutt Bounty (V) against LSC, or Jabba's Influence (V) if I felt I needed Gailid immediately.  <br>
<br>
Please forgive the briefness of most of these reports, considering we were getting like 3 hours of sleep each night at the most, and dealing with the grueling 2 hour commute to and from Pastimes, most of those days blended together.<br>
<br>
Team Tournament<br>
Game 1 - MKOS vs. Mike Gemme's LSC<br>
Thomas vs. Justin Desai<br>
<br>
This game ended up being pretty simple, considering I had completely forgotten how to play the deck.  Basically he sets up on Naboo with one Jedi at each site, while I have like 150 aliens in my hand, and deploy them ALL to Tatooine.  He puts Mace and Obi at one of my sites, I barrier, I fortify, he barriers, and the 2 Jedi have to make a scamper through the Audience Chamber.  I don't remember exactly how the battles went, but basically I killed off the Jedi, but Gailid died, and I didn't have Hutt Influence out, so he puts out Projections, Uh-Oh (V), and musicians with his Jedi, and that was basically game since he'd be retrieving 2 a turn against my 1 damage, so after he recycles a bunch of cards with Away Put Your Weapon (V), I draw up.<br>
<br>
FL -24, 0 (-24)<br>
<br>
Thomas lost big and very quickly, so we were the last place team after game 1.<br>
<br>
Game 2 - MKOS vs. Warren Maruschak's WHAP<br>
Thomas vs. Ryan Mason<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those games I can't remember too much of, but I do remember IMMEDIATELY attacking Amidala as soon as she appeared, though he It's a Trap-ed it (and did the same later).  Basically I had a force of about 7 guys on Naboo chasing Amidala around, while still draining on Tatooine for 4.  He left 2 Jedi with sabers in front of my force, and I remember battling, drawing 3 destiny at +3 each, and he lost both plus a lot.  Pretty close to the most "offensive" game I've ever played.  <br/>
<br/>
FW +19, 2 (-5)<br/>
<br/>
Ryan won, so both of our teams were 1-3.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - MKOS vs. Bill Kafer's LSC<br/>
Thomas vs. Greg Shaw<br/>
<br/>
Having learned my lesson in the first game, I knew the idea would be to totally blanket Naboo and force him to fight me.  First turn I do my standard pulls, and luckily he just draws on his turn, allowing me to get my activation set up and guys in my hand.  He throws down Luke + saber at the 3/2 site and Yoda MoFo at the other.  I throw down 4-5 guys and battle, he Dodges Yoda away.  Much of the interaction involved that 2/2 site, and eventually we cleared each other, though I eventually threw another force there.  I can't remember if he Nabrun-ed someone or deployed him there, but one of his guys ended up at Tatooine: Jabba's Palace with an empty Sail Barge sitting there.  I deploy most of my hand of guys down and whoever it was died plus 7-10 overflow.  Most of the rest of the game involved him putting 1-2 mains down with me responding with yet another 3-4 characters.  Late game he puts down Kessel with HCF, having seen me ditch my ships to drains, but I cancel it most turns with Den of Thieves or Myo, and eventually he can't pay for it.  I retrieved about 10 force with Scum, 6 with Jabba's Twerps, and another 6-7 Abyssins, which made up for the difference in cards on table.<br/>
<br/>
FW +10, 4 (+5)<br/>
<br/>
Thomas lost again, so we're sitting at 2-4 with pretty bad differential.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - MKOS vs. Tom Hollingsworth's HB X-wings<br/>
Thomas vs. Mark Newmann<br/>
<br/>
Neither of our teams were in a position to win anything, so I guess we weren't very focused, so we made a lot of mistakes.  Basically he sets up a bunch of systems and starts paying 15 to drain for 8 in space (one ship at each location), while I get Hutt Influence out and pay 9 to drain for an uncancelable/unmodifiable 6 on the ground.  As this was the first game that involved actual systems on table early, I completely forgot that I had a pullable ship in Jabba's Space Cruiser (V), and was frantically drawing for another ship.  Late game he puts down a Forest with Qui-Gon EPP, and I'm running low on force, so all I can do is respond with Boba Fett BH and an Abyssin, but that's enough for 2 battle destinies at +3 each, which became an 8 and a 6, so he lost Qui-Gon plus some overflow, and the Forest was emptied.  I eventually get Bossk in space and battle a lone X-wing, though he Hyper Escapes away, but at least I had free drains after that.  He drops an X-wing down to the Forest when I had no cards in hand, so I deploy a Myo from my objective, retrieve 2, and make him forfeit it.  This game could've gone either way if we weren't stupid.   He pulled 3 shields immediately on his first turn, none of which were Aim High, so I got free retrieval all game, and he forgot that he could still cancel the drains my Bossk and Myo were getting.  I retrieved just enough to pull it out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +2, 6 (+7)<br/>
<br/>
Thomas won his last game by 13 or so, so we ended up a respectable 4-4.  The only card worth mentioning in the packs we got was a BB Commander Luke.  Since it was nearly midnight, we had to call for a taxi to get a ride back to the train station.  The driver was pretty cool for the most part, until he started talking about "I used to stalk this girl in that neighborhood over there, back when stalking wasn't stalking".  $23.20 for the ride, another hour on the train later and I more or less crash while Mike and Thomas playtested until about 3:30am.  Mike had planned on bringing my Endor Ops as well, but floundered at the last minute and switched to ISB Drop and Drain, which turned out well for him in our game, but probably not as well for the others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Day 2<br/>
Game 1 - DBO vs. Ryan Mason's DS Combat Dueling<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes, the other half of the Canadian duo Thomas and I faced earlier.  One of those matchups that heavily favors DBO due to reducing his drains to 1, though I have to be careful not to topdeck anything important if he gets Maul down early.  Which, of course, he did, with double-bladed saber, so I had to eat one big drain of 4, and thankfully didn't lose anything important.  I flip, get out Hoth and a squadron, and for a while he was having to pay 3 to drain for 1.  Eventually I have out Endor as well, with 2 squadrons at each, so he's eating free drains of 5, and since I had Goo Nee Tay in my starting hand, and he was only activating 8 force, he had to save up multiple turns to put down Boba + someone to move them around Dantooine and flip me back.  Next turn I put down Tanus, Screaming Lando and Luke RS to fight Boba, he captures Lando, and he loses Boba plus a few.  I put down Padme and Leia RP to the Forest to fortify there, and things are looking pretty good, even though I'm not flipped, since he was still having to pay 3 to drain for 2 and the other guy (Vader maybe? Vader came down later elsewhere) was at the Jungle draining for 0.  He makes a last ditch attempt to hurt me, by getting out Choke Vader with saber to the Forest to fight Tanus+Luke RS + Leia RP + Padme.  I initiate seeing that he had no force active and thus couldn't swing, I swing and hit Vader, and he plays Vader's Anger (V) against Luke.  He draws a 2 and a 4, I draw a 5, so he wins by one, Luke gets POOPed, I lose 5, and he can swing again.  He chokes Leia, slices Padme, and I can't draw destiny.  Fantastic.  Luckily the Forest made Tanus immune, so he was still around, I drained for 4, added Obi+saber to the Forest (I had seen him pull The Circle is Now Complete earlier, so I had to hold onto him), and drained him out from there.<br/>
<br/>
FW +6, 2 (+6)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - Endor Ops vs. Brian Hunter's LS Combat<br/>
<br/>
Initially the pairings had me playing against Angelo's QMC, which would've been the better matchup for me I think (though my starting hand was utter garbage), as LSC tends to be 50/50.  My hand this time is full of cards with ability, so I had no trouble setting up space, but couldn't find my walkers for Veers, nor any of my tractor beam stuff, which ended up being my downfall.  He puts Luke + saber + Lightsaber Proficiency at my DB early, so for a few turns I eat drains of 3 there.  I get set up in space, so we're both paying 9 to drain for 6, obviously with him having less cards on table.  He puts down Savrip, plus Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V) to the DB, puts Luke aboard and moves up to space, leaving me free to plop Vader + Tarkin down to satisfy Battle Order.  By that time I had lost 3-4 SDs to drains, but had a few left in hand, which received a bunch of barriers.  He topdecks his Bionic Hand (V), which he Wokling's for to get a 7 back in deck to track for On The Edge.  Eventually I corner his ship, and he puts down HCF, allowing me to barrier him, he senses, and I say "Ok, draw that 7", and indeed he draws the Bionic Hand.  Thus, HCF is stuck, so next turn I battle and hit him for about 20 battle damage, but unfortunately I never found my Masterful Move, so he lost 2 mains from hand that he retrieved with the On The Edge.  Since I could never find my Levitation Attacks (V) or They've Shut Down the Main Reactors (I drew them for destiny about 5 times), I couldn't get him out of space, so his free drains and Ultimatum coverage cost me the game.<br/>
<br/>
FL -12, 2 (-6)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - Endor Ops vs. Sibille Schontauf's LS Combat<br/>
<br/>
Yeesh, facing my 3rd LSC in a row to start the day (and 4th LS one out of the 2 days).  Most of the things I couldn't find last game were in my hand to start this one, so besides SDs with tractor beams at the ready in space, I had General Veers (V) in Blizzard 1 (V) at the DB, hitting her with drains of 3 and 4 in space.  There were many fights at the DB, such as her playing Flash (V) to check her destiny, taking a swing at Blizzard 1 (V) with Quick Draw (V) (which she did 3-4 times oddly enough), and noticing a 6 on top to crack my immunity, so Veers died, and I would have to keep throwing on random pilots to keep it going.  Luckily, I had Vader EPP and Maul EPP in my hand to keep fortifying, and when searching my reserve deck with Praji I noticed that out of 5 cards, 3 were 6s, which was gonna be my only shot at killing off Mace.  I can't remember what order things happened in, but I think I put Maul down but didn't battle, she battled and Blaster Deflectioned one swing and Dodged the other (which turned out to be a good move considering the 3 6s ended up on top), so Maul died, but she drew low enough for Blizzard 1 to stick around.  I put down Vader next turn and still didn't battle (didn't want to remove my ground presence by my own stupidity), she battled, hit Vader, but I drew the 2 6s again to hit Mace, and the 6 for battle destiny made her lose the other Jedi plus some.  Without occupying both Naboo sites and my DB, she couldn't satisfy Ultimatum, so those drains of 3 and 4 really hurt.<br/>
<br/>
FW +12, 4 (+6)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - DBO vs. Micah Wooten's SYCFA Fear<br/>
<br/>
Me: "Don't laugh when you see my objective."  Micah: "I won't, unless it's DBO, then I'll just pick up my cards and leave."  LOL.   This is another matchup that tends to favor DBO (though I've never faced Fear), because Overwhelmed does nothing, I have more ground and places I can actually drain, and his drains (even with Chiraneau) are gone.  We do our respective setups, which gives me plenty of time to flip and find squadrons.  He gets out like 6-7 systems, and throws down a handful of SDs and spreads.  I drop a few squadrons and S-foils, eliminate a few, and eat 2-4 Fear damage next turn.  His hand was pretty low, so he puts down another SD and Sidious, and draws for more.  I drain, active S-foils, and move 2 squads to another system he had a lone SD at.  His turn he throws down 3 SDs and battles me, thinking that should be enough, but I play Organized Attack, and his 4 SDs are only a power 32 to my power 36 before destiny, he ditches crossfire, and I still win the battle, so he loses a ship and I lose nothing.  I can't remember what other battles happened, but I don't recall losing a ship, and he mostly had to avoid me.  He made a couple mistakes that cost him late game, like using a Control on one of my drains of 2, knowing that I had an Alter in my hand after Monnoking me, so I sent Fear to his used pile and he never got it back out.  Another was that I put Obi JK + saber down to his DB to fight Sidious, and he had a Cease Fire in hand to prevent me swinging, but didn't play it, so Sidious died, so the last 4-5 turns the only damage he could do was to pay 3 to drain for 1 at Kiffex, while I was draining for 5-7.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16, 6 (+22)<br/>
<br/>
We take a much needed break for lunch, so we went to Wendy's, and nearly everyone there was 2-2, so it seemed things would be pretty close all day.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - Endor Ops vs. Steven Lewis's LU(V) Speeders<br/>
<br/>
The biggest mistake I made all day was at the beginning of the game, not starting BOTH Imperial Decrees.  I started only the V, which reduced his speeder damage to 1, but it allowed him to get off an unimpeded T-47 Battle Formation drain of 11 later on that clinched the game.  A lot of battles happened at Hoth, with his Haven there, and eventually he had to evade (too bad I couldn't find Sullust to make him lose 5-8), but he started pulling all his Alternatives to Fighting, and no more actual battles happened after that in space, so he had his free drains.  I had General Veers + Blizzard 1 at the DB for a few turns, then he activates Maneuvering Flaps, puts down the ASP-707 droid and 5-6 speeders, I draw a crappy 4 and 0 for destiny, and I lose both plus 7 (which is the most overflow I lost all day).  I also made the mistake of not grabbing his Alternatives to Fighting, since he would just retrieve it with Luke and play it again.  Speeders is a deck I've never faced before, and I couldn't afford to make mistakes like that with Lewis playing like a champ.<br/>
<br/>
FL -18ish, 6 (+4)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - DBO vs. Brian Rippetoe's CCT<br/>
<br/>
He's starting Special Delivery (V) and other helpful stuff instead of Iggy, so I'm expecting a free Executor first turn.  I had a Sabotage in my opening hand, so I could've blind drawn to kill the Carbonite Chamber Console, but that would be risky, and I would need it for his inevitable tractor beam.  I suspended his Mob. Pts combo with the shield, but he had the Executor in his hand anyway.  I do my setup, and so his potential drains are zeroed, and get out a few squadrons at Endor, drawing up and finding a few more.  I try to Sabotage (V) his Tractor Beam with Corran out, but I draw a 3, Corran subtracts one, and he has Lando add one, and I never found my other Sabotage (V).  He eventually has Lando+Chiraneau+Flagship(V)+Tractor Beam+DSGs(V) on the Executor (plus someone else I think, GAT?), and moves over to where my Squadrons are.  I throw down extra squadrons (4 X-wing and 1 Y-wing there), he barriers one, and we fight.  He plays In Range on my X-wing squad and draws a 3, saying "I got it" and I say "nope, In Range only adds 2 when targeting a unique ship", and he has to reread the card.  In the commotion we both forget that I had one X-wing squad barriered, so with an Organized attack, I had power 57 plus destiny, and the battle ended up 59 to his 31, and he had to lose all the pilots plus 7ish overflow, and I lost nothing.  Without that squad I would've had 47 power and he would've only lose 2 pilots plus 2 other cards or so, but I honestly forgot myself and so did he until later, though it probably wouldn't have changed the outcome very much.  He tracks some good destinies and tractors an X-wing squad and a Y-wing squad (forfeited the Y-wing squad later), but due to Organized Attack my ships still had plenty of power to stick around, and I was draining on the ground.  He puts down Mara to fight my guys at the Swamp on Dantooine, but I add a couple guys and he has to use his auto-Ghhhk effect.  I grabbed his They've Shut Down the Main Reactor, so he couldn't prevent my ships from moving all around while I drained for 1-2 on the ground plus a few in space when his Executor had to make 2 jumps to get where I was, to his 0 (I lost zero to drains this game), so that was it.<br/>
<br/>
FW +23, 8 (+27)<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 - DBO vs. Michael Richards' ISB Drop and Drain<br/>
<br/>
Figures that I'd have to play a teammate at this crucial juncture, with us both 4-2.  We both know each other's decks, and we both know it's going to be extremely close, since he has to rely completely on Occupation damage and I have to try to kick Maul out of space.  For the first 4-5 turns all he does is put out Tatooine locations, and I have horrible luck finding my Dantooine stuff (2nd turn I activated 7 or so and both other sites were in there).  He Monnoks me lost and I lose 3 X-wing squadrons, which prevented me from realistically putting out Endor as well to drain at.  Eventually I flip and get a squadron out to Hoth, and then his huge hand plays out (I had no grimtaash in the deck to deal with it), getting out Sunsdown on Tatooine, one guy each at 8 sites, Maul in ship + Tatooine Occupation, and Drop to reduce my hand down to 8 (removing 3-4 mains).  I throw down some guys on Tatooine to fight his lone ISB agents, but don't really accomplish much besides making him react and put a few more guys down.  I'm draining for 3-6 and losing 7-8 to Occupation damage, but he has more cards on table, so we quickly get down to the end game scenario.  I have an X-wing squad sitting in front of Maul in ship doing nothing except look menacing.   It looks like I have more cards to lose, so Michael has to think for a while what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Basically (my memory/math might not be completely right here, but you'll get the idea):<br/>
I will drain for 6 each turn (2 Dantooine sites, Hoth for 2, Obi+saber at one of his sites) and he has 10 life force with 1 card in hand, being able to retrieve an ISB agent each turn.<br/>
I had 10 life force or so and 7ish cards in hand, which include (unknown to Michael) a Y-wing Squadron, Corran Horn, and Organized Attack.<br/>
If he cloaks Maul each turn, he loses.<br/>
If he doesn't and can't find evasion, he loses, since I would deploy my stuff and smackdown Maul with 23 power + destiny to his 6 + destiny, he would have to lose Maul and ship and Occupation would be gone.<br/>
He moves Mara over in front of Obi, draws one card, retrieves one, and says go.<br/>
My turn I hit him for 4, so he's down to 6 cards and 2 in hand.  I throw down the Y-wing squad and he plays the one card he drew, I'd Just As Soon Kiss a Wookiee, sending it back to my hand.<br/>
At this point I'm still ok, since even with being forced to play the squad next turn, I can lose the Corran in my hand and have one card left in life force and drain him out the next turn.<br/>
I move Mon Mothma to the 3rd Dantooine site, Obi to another site, and say go.<br/>
His turn I lose 7, 4 from hand and a few from reserve.  He moves Mara, retrieves, draws one card and says go.<br/>
My turn I hit him for 4, he's down to 4 cards, 1 in reserve, 1 in force pile, and 2 in hand.  I have to put out the Y-wing squad, and he plays the one card he drew, a Barrier.<br/>
At this point, I'm STILL ok, since I still had the Corran and Organized Attack in hand and 6 in life force, and would lose 7 next turn, so I would have 1 card left when I drained him for 5, which is what he would've had left even after retrieving one.<br/>
Next turn he hits me for 7, I'm down to one card, then he plays the one other card he had been holding for a while... Limited Resources.<br/>
<br/>
Michael admits that the previous 2 cards were completely blind, lucky draws, and that's exactly what he needed to win (and in the right order).  Also another game in which I lost 0 to drains.  I can also chuck this up to a loss due to not owning a lot of the best cards (if I had a Free Ride combo it would've been in there).<br/>
<br/>
FL -3, 8 (+24)<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 - Endor Ops vs. Joe Olson's WYS<br/>
<br/>
This is another one of those 50/50 matchups for my deck.  Well, 50/50 in theory anyway, since I've never played against one (despite my fellow Texans' love for it).  The topic comes up involving whether or not one of us should draw up if it's obvious we're going to lose, since we were both 4-3 and needed differential help to make it to Day 3, but this being such a close match, I said that scenario wouldn't really come up until it was too late, so we played it out.  He sets up pretty fast, with guys at the Cantina and a few ships at Tatooine.  Tatooine Celebration comes out briefly, but by then I had a huge space fleet ready to take control, so he got to retrieve 1 force and fled the system.  I had out a tractor beam, but couldn't find a They've Shut Down the Main Reactor to prevent him from moving around until later.  Eventually I draw one and get to fight his Dash+Outrider+Chewie(V)+Falcon, and he has to lose Chewie and the Falcon.  Later he adds Han and Lando aboard the Outrider for forfeit fodder, but I track a 5 and In Range it, which ended his occupation of space.  I get down Vader + Tarkin at his docking bay (mine was occupied by a few smugglers in Chewie's AT-ST), and he has the shield out, so a battle happens and I lose Tarkin.  I move some SDs over and drop the pilots down to back Vader up to occupy a site, and I drain him out not too long after.<br/>
<br/>
FW +6, 10 (+30)<br/>
<br/>
So I end up 12th at 5-3, with only fair differential.  DBO went 3-1, Endor Ops 2-2.  Michael got hit bad on his last game vs. Brian Fred when he got hit for 8 with Imperial Propoganda, then ICBW-ed it without an It's a Hit, then Brian It's Worse-d it for another 6, and Limited Resources after that, so Michael ended up 14th.  Sadly, none of Team Texas made the finals, but we all ended up .500 or better (Thomas and JW 4-4, Michael and I 5-3), and JW had better luck with the Endor Ops than I did.  It hit me that if Day 3 involved 12 people as it always had, I would've been in it, but I guess I can't complain if I didn't complain about it before I ended up in that 9th-12th zone.<br/>
<br/>
It was after midnight by the time we were done, and everyone was hungry, so we searched for a place that was still open and found Omega's, this relatively fancy bakery down the street.  Mmmm, strawberry pancakes...    Nearly everyone went there, though not together (13 of us in one group, looked like about the same in another that got there earlier).<br/>
<br/>
After 3 days of little sleep, we weren't really in the mood to wake up early yet again and play another 6 games in the consolation tournament, so we decided to just sleep in, waking up around noon or so, ate lunch at a nice Mexican place, and headed over to Pastimes just to hang out for a bit and see the finals.  Michael left from there to head to the airport, and we left not to long after that (picking up our prize support and saying goodbye to all our new friends, "awww").  We chilled that night, went to a bar down the street to get some food and watch the Packers/Bears game (and tried to keep Thomas' Packer allegiance a secret).  Thomas' flight left early Monday, and mine left in the evening, so JW and I ordered some vintage Chicago-style pizza (not that impressed really, but certainly filling) for lunch, played a lot of Halo 3, and I headed out about 3:30 (though due to delays I didn't lift off the ground until 9:30 or so)<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Henry and Nate for running things smoothly and being VERY cool guys<br/>
JW's friend Doak for giving us a place to stay<br/>
JW for picking me up from the airport, being a good Halo 3 partner, and liking my deck enough to copy it<br/>
Michael for helping me put faces to names of all these people I had heard of (probably none of which will remember me)<br/>
Michael for winning both Pre-Day 1 tourneys<br/>
Thomas for keeping us entertained, and proving yet again that sleep and sobriety aren't required to play SWCCG<br/>
Most of the "top players" who are jerks on the forums but are pretty much ALL nice guys in-person (this can't be overstated, Day 2 = fun times for all)<br/>
"Ze Germans", just because<br/>
Danny McEntee for, though I don't know him personally, giving me the ideas for both of my decks (combined record: 24-8)<br/>
Omega's for being open 24 hrs (sweet bread baskets too)<br/>
Me for not sucking<br/>
Dave McCune for being the first new face I met there (DSG(V)'s destiny+1 text FTW!)<br/>
Michael Pistone for giving us a ride on Saturday (and not being mad at us for getting you pulled over... thankfully no ticket)<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Having never been anywhere NEAR as far north as Chicago before, I was hoping for the weather to be a little cooler than 90 degrees<br/>
The 2-hr commute to Pastimes<br/>
No air-conditioning where we were staying<br/>
The buses for stopping at 10:20pm<br/>
Our waitress at the bar on Sunday night<br/>
Following my buddies around Chicago on foot on a quest for a place that would sell beer after midnight (answer: 7-Eleven)<br/>
A 3.5 hr delay on my flight back (terminal got changed 3 times, then the plane we boarded had its computer die, so we had to get off and wait for another plane)<br/>
Missing the Dallas-Buffalo game because of said delay<br/>
Me for sucking.... at Guitar Hero (though I had never played before, so...)<br/>
Thomas' taste in women :-P<br/>
<br/>
See ya'll next year. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
