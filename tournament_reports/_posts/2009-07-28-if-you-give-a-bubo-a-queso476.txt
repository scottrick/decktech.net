San Diego Mega Tournament, Part 1.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you missed out on an amazing weekend of Star Wars;  a veritable minefield of nerd bombs, sealed play, and constructed ridiculousness.  I decided to go back at the MPC, and got my ticket a couple of months before hand, but really had no time or inclination to practice or playtest, as evident in my decklists.  I played three games against Taylor Gosiaco the Saturday before the weekend, and that was it.  I built a goofy combat with Luke SITF because of the ridiculous battling/beatdown potential when you combo him with Sai'tor and Rycar.  For Dark I made a CRV list which I finished actually putting together and v'ing fifteen minutes after the tournament was supposed to start.  I concentrated on beatdowns and strong red, with gaping holes left by my forgetting good cards because I was building it in a hurry.  I got into town mid-afternoon on Friday and hung out with Tom McGee and Aaron Nelson while we waited for Jan Westergaard to arrive.  After we picked him up we went to the hotel to drop our stuff and play in the Ref III sealed event.<br>
<br>
Ref III sealed is awesome.  Secret Squirrel rules apply, and each player got a JPSD, two RIII packs, and a Premiere pack.  My deck had a bunch of strong red, but the only amazing character pull was Bib Fortuna: I could flip my objective for +2 BD's.  Of course, since it's Squirrel, if my opponent has Jabba and Bib on table and I flip then I still get +2 on my BD's :P  My red was pretty rid though.  I think my list was something like this:<br>
<br>
obj<br>
Desert Heart<br>
JP<br>
Twi'lek<br>
Power Of The Hutt<br>
<br>
Lower Passages<br>
Antechamber<br>
<br>
18 or so dudes, including two droids<br>
<br>
both racing skiffs<br>
<br>
A Gift<br>
Projection<br/>
Den Of Thieves<br/>
Hutt Influence<br/>
and a couple other awesome effects that I can't remember<br/>
<br/>
good interrupts including a second Twi'lek<br/>
=40<br/>
<br/>
Jan Westergaard opened an RIII pack with Lando Scoundrel, Lord Maul, and WB Obi-Wan.  Aaron Nelson got a jedi lightsaber and WB Obi-Wan in the same pack.<br/>
<br/>
Game #1: pile vs Matt Thornton<br/>
He starts the AC as his site.  He gets out Jabba and Ep1 Bib to his Audience Chamber turn 1, I think.  I drew my gift and a droid so that's fine.  Once I flip my objective my draws will be plus 2 from his dudes and where he has an alien his will be -2.  He's got Obi JK and does a bit of draining, but I get out good power at multiple sites and have den going so he's not doing too much.  I get in some good battles with Lando and reacting skiffs, and a Gift is locking him down hard core, even though he set for stuns the droid once, and then no escapes it, gets Lando with it, Ounee Ta's it, and gets the droid again at some point.  I'm draining steadily though for 3-4 a turn and wear him down to win by 10.<br/>
<br/>
Game #2<br/>
I really don't remember who I played.  I won by 15, and there was fighting and dudes and a gift and such I think.<br/>
<br/>
Game #3 vs Brian Herold<br/>
This was a a fun game.  He had a Sandwhirl and there were multiple deserts on table.  Critical moment was when I Fallen Portal'd out of a beatdown (and then Skulled to get it back in hand!) at Jabba's Palace, and I got in an early beat on his Jabba with my Bib and Lando to get +2 on my draws, which were both 4's so it was like ten overflow.  I ended up winning by like 16?<br/>
<br/>
So Kevin and I get to play the final.  We decide to use new decks, since the prizes consisted of an RIII pack for each of us.  We cracked the packs without looking, shuffled in one JP pack without looking, had other players find our starting locations for us and played by looking at our cards as we went w/no searching.  He got the death star war room and I had the west gallery, but I had the baller first turn play of conference room, abyssin for 2, move him over for 1.  He can't attack because then I get a destiny.  Eventually I put out a desert for more activation and I put a monk at it.  So he puts a monk at it.  Much laughter ensues since they can't really do anything.  Unfortunately I get 4 ability in three dudes and smack him down.  I comes back with dudes to block but I get Pote Snitkin on a skiff for huge power and clear him off.  Abyssin is draining all the while, so that's pretty much the game.<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo, that was freaking hilarious!  I love sealed!<br/>
<br/>
Dinner at Chili's ensued, and Kevin and I played another game with five JP packs each.  We decide that we'd each draw cards for our starting hand until we got a location, which would be our starting location, and the smallest starting hand would go first.  He flips over the Tatooine Desert, I got like 4 cards and then Jawa Camp.  He draws first turn, obviously.  I draw into Kalit, which will lock up the jawa camp for sure since Kevin won't get destiny there.  Eventually he puts out something at the desert, but I have BUBO.  He saves for a turn and then retaliates with two trandoshans and a Ree-Yees to clobber the Bubo.  Crazy, he's supposed to be invincible.  I find the Rancor Pit and then the Audience Chamber, but I'd lost my Trap Door earlier :(  I pulled a dude (somebody else finds the first viable card with searches and shuffles so we can't see) and took it over, but he comes back with BUBO.  He eats a dude, but I come back with 4 ability,  power, and declare I'm going to kill Bubo.  A five destiny later, he's down, which means TWO Bubo's bit the dust in one sealed game.  Ridiculous.  Kevin has drawn into good characters while I can only find four cost ability one dudes so I get blown off the Aud Chamber and he's draining for several and theres a desert between the ac and the jawa camp so I can't move in.  Kevin wins!<br/>
<br/>
After this we eat our food on top of the cards, and Kevin sticks Ree Yees in the ranch, and then bubo gets the ranch, followed by the queso.  We eventually decide that someone needs to v an EPP Bubo with Queso.  Classic.<br/>
<br/>
I look at my decks and play a few games with WYS, but in discussing the meta with Tom I decide that WYS is not a deck that I should run due to lack of practice.  Combat it is, to heck with the meta.  I need to make the crv but I'll deal with it in the morning. Eventually get to sleep at like three.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to cut this part off here, Part 2 coming shortly. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
