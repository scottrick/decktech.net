<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Another in a continuing report of the Light Side dominating tournament scene.<br>
<br>
Ah, another Battle of Endor tournament.  Another chance to try my hand at achieving the hard to find foils (heck, has anyone outside of Decipher seen these things yet?  Let alone what cards they are foils of? :)).  <br>
<br>
This was yet another tournament I was way underprepared for.  Not as much as my last Battle of Endor, as my dark deck saw action twice the day before and my light deck saw action once the day before.  Decks I went with this time were There Is Good In Him/Launching the Assault/Midge/High Ability Scouts and Bring Him Before Me/Big Blue.<br>
<br>
After my last tournament I decided that Endor Ops was not the objevtive to start.  Instead I decided the additional destiny draw from BHBM would serve me far better then the early activation...after this tournament I have pretty much decided that the dark side is woefully underpowered in this game (cough cough Strike Planning...Insertion Planning...General Crix Madine...Blount...Cracken cough cough)<br>
<br>
So the tournament started.  James Leiser (sp?) director.<br>
<br>
Game 1 - My There Is Good In Him vs Mark’s Endor: Back Door<br>
<br>
I am not quite sure what to say about this game except it was an unfortunate lopsided game.  The guy started Back Door with no effects and no objective (gasp - I know).  So early on I was generating tons of force.  No Vader in his deck meaning no matter what, 2 force loss a turn...not bad...game pretty much revolved like this:  He deployed...I deployed...I battled...he lost.  Very hard for him to keep anyone on the table.  Threepio kept recycling or adding a destiny (Were You Looking for Me?).  The recycling 6 of Insertion Planning was preventing my character loss. Launching the Assault hit the table at end game with only one system on the table.  At that point it didn’t matter anyways.  Incredibly lopsided game.<br>
<br>
FW (+23)<br>
<br>
Highlights:  I won.  Yeeha.<br>
Lowlights:  I won.  It really didn’t feel much like a victory though...<br>
<br>
Game 2 - My Bring Him Before Me vs Jeremy Kauffman’s Rebel Strike Team<br>
<br>
Early in the day I played my BHBM deck against my brother.  He won.  Basically the deck came together poorly and I did some restructuring afterwords.  Night before the deck came together perfectly and won in only a few turns.  After realizing that I needed to find some Imperial Command’s in oh the next 4 hours, I decided to keep the deck pretty much as it was.  Let me tell you about the bloodshed in this game...<br>
<br>
Both of our decks started slowly.  Either he was concerned that I was trying for a beat down or he was not getting what he needed to start the objective moving.  Either way, neither of us drained for much of anything until around turn 3.  And then it was him draining for 1.  I figured that I could take some more time in setting up and not getting Piett, Merjjik, or Imperial Command in hand was hurting me severely.  That and my incredibly low activation. I was drawing a lot of red and pilotless blue...not Big Blue...no systems...it was just running so so poorly.  Finally got Piett in hand, drew Merjjk with his text, drew Carida (far parsec away from Endor+good activation for me) and attempted to set my game plan in motion (basic Chiranue+We’re In Attack Position Now for immunity on stardestroyers and force drain +1 @ systems).  Never happened.  By this time I was so flustered at how poorly my deck was coming together and how well his was coming together (coupled with my new found fear of coming down to Endor against the stupid scouts...) I was draining for so little and his objective flipped giving him drains of 8 a turn.  Ah well.  Game ended with a frustrated draw up.  Stupid dark side.<br>
<br>
FL (-20)<br>
<br/>
Highlights:  Finally playing against a top player in the area in round 2<br/>
Lowlights:  Having this fear of coming down to Endor now.  Forgetting to use Merjjk for oh 4 turns.  Deck just not coming together like it should have.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My There Is Good In Him vs Drew Scott’s Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
After my last game I was not sure how I was going to do.  The loss had really demoralized me.  I figured I would lose, but I thought it would at least be close.  Ah well.  Each game is a new game (so to speak).<br/>
<br/>
This game started out pretty well.  I moved Luke to the Platform first turn and drew up.  Next turn he places Tempest Scout 4+ATST Pilot at the docking bay to capture Luke.  After explaining that an ATST with no capacity could not capture he figured he was sitting pretty and let it there, not battling (I don’t think he had any force).  Next turn came down the Furry Menace (Chewie) with his Bowcaster, and I initiate Battle.  Chewie shoots at the ATST and draws a 6 and a 5, absolutely destroying the Tempest Scout.  Insertion Planning almost kept Chewie from the lost pile...Next battle took place in space.  Tala 1 with Colonel Cracken vs Major Turr Phennir in Sabre 2.  He beat me with a destiny draw of 3.  Enough to make me lose force but not enough to make me Lose Cracken.  Next turn, Calrissian, Nien Numb, Falcon, Blount in Tala 2 all came down and made some rough introductions.  This was game.  The force loss was high, enough to take him out of the game, but not enough to end game.  He drops an imp to the Bunker and an imp to the landing platform, captures Luke and moves him to the Bunker.  Places a system, tries to hold it, but Home 1 with Ackbar and Rebel Leadership prevents that.  After forgetting I Can Save Him a few turns, I hit him with the 2 force loss and watch Vader go to the Lost pile.  After that it was game.  He could never keep a force on the ground with Blount in Tala 2 and Cracken in Tala 1 hurting his scout deploy.<br/>
<br/>
FW (26)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Big win.  Put me in contention for first.<br/>
Lowlights:  Free Ride never found a combat vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - My Bring Him Before Me vs Drew Scott’s Rebel Strike Team<br/>
<br/>
Great.  My third time against RST, second time against Drew’s, and he was looking for blood after his loss to me.  I thought that I would have no chance, but at least I knew what he had in his deck for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Game started slowly for me, again.  This time though he got running early on.  Bunker was blown quickly, keeping his objective flipped.  Again, the deck never set up properly.  Need so many more Imperial Commands to make this deck work.  1 just isn’t enough...<br/>
<br/>
Pulled Gall early on and placed Sabre 2 there.  Next turn - Home 1.  His destiny - a 6.  Goodbye Tie.  No problem, just try again.  But as with last time, lots of red, little Blue.  Couldn’t knock him out of space until late game.  At which point I found out the Power of Taking Them With Us.  Thunderflare with 2 pilots versus Nubuleon B Frigate with Heavy Turbolaser Batteries.  Down comes Taking Them With Us, initiates battle, reduces my armor by 2, shoots down the Thunderflare, draws a destiny and cans only the frigate.  That was game.  He drained on Endor next turn costing me the game.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-20)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Can’t really say there was many.<br/>
Lowlights:  Seeing the power of Taking Them With Us...<br/>
<br/>
So wrapped this tournament up in 4th place.  Not bad if I say so myself.  Keeps me at a mesely .500 in Battle of Endor, but could be worse.  In the end, I had fun, got a couple of packs (Hummelstown has got some NICE prize support - Emperor was given to first place), and played in a tournament once again (4 this year!).<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things of note:<br/>
<br/>
Dark side does not have enough revolving high USEFUL destinies.<br/>
<br/>
Dark side does not seem to be able to win with any consistency.  It seems like the entire dark side game is revolved around preventing a big differential loss in the later games rather then winning.  Nothing seems to work well against Crix and his brigade of Scouts.<br/>
<br/>
Why is there no Strike Planning for the Dark side?<br/>
<br/>
Why is there no Insertion Planning for the Dark side?<br/>
<br/>
(if the answer is yes to either of the above, please please let me know what I am missing).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the games are fun, but the Dark Side has an incredibly tough time winning.  Kind of like in the movie...huh. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
