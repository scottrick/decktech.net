<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Warning!  This is a long TR.  If you don't want to read it all, scroll down to the deck lists (not complete lists because I just list some main parts), then read the games and know that it was a cube draft championship event!<br>
<br>
PRE-EVENT STUFF<br>
<br>
Last year sometime, myself and some other Atlanta players had the idea of doing a large Cube championship event, and the time had finally come!  People around here love the cube.  It is great for newer players and also very challenging for us seasoned vets.  Its also the type of event that a new player can do very well in without knowing everything about the latest v-cards or constructed deck meta.<br>
<br>
This is how the tournament was setup:<br>
Everyone drafts both light and dark and plays 3 games with each.  For prize support, we decided to give away a worlds bye and a v-card design, with the stipulation that the v-card must be used to create a cube-only card, ala Baragwin (v).  The top 2 players would play a final confrontation to determine the winner, who would get to choose which main prize he wanted (2nd place got the other).<br>
<br>
We ended up getting 13 players, which is a decent amount, but I think we could have done a lot better.  Our largest event last year was 23 and I thought this would rival that one.  There was one brand new player though, and we've seen a couple other new players this year already, so that is exciting!<br>
<br>
<br>
THE DRAFT<br>
<br>
After going over the basics of how to cube draft with a couple guys who never had before, we got started.  I really hoped to draft from my own cube, but it was all decided randomly and I got one of Kevin's instead.  My goal for this draft, and the event as a whole, wasn't to draft the best cards possible (my normal strategy), but instead to try drafting a theme.  The cubes have lots of themes you can go with (scum, imp domination v, light side aliens, weapons, farming, and even more).  Drafting a theme is normally pretty hard and you can mess it up a lot easier than just choosing the most solid and useful cards.  So basically I thought this wasn't the best way to try to win the event but I would try it anyway.<br>
<br>
I didn't make notes about what I saw in each pack, but I will do my best to tell you the highlights.<br>
<br>
Light side draft:<br>
We started with light, and my first pack revealed a lot of standard cards, and one strong character - the light Mara Jade.  This was actually a promo character that isn't legal in constructed.  She is actually kind of scary to use in the cube since she can be converted (ala Lando) by dark side Mara.  But she can also convert dark Mara, so I went with her.  My second pick was a light side version of Imperial Domination (v) that Kevin made for his cube.  So the first 2 picks were 2 custom cards... :)  Anyways, I thought light Mara had the alien and the rebel icon, but no, it was only the alien icon, so she would be useless in my newly chosen theme.<br>
<br/>
The draft continued and I tried to find good rebel cards, but there was little to be had...  I got some T-47s like Dash in Rogue 10 and some 2/2 rebels, but no Insurrection (boo!) and I wasn't seeing any ships at all.  Finally I found a Gold Squadron 1.  I ended up getting it, Squad Assignments, and General Calrissian.  Unfortunately, that ended up being my whole space package!  <br/>
<br/>
With about 2 packs left, it was clear that my attempt to draft a "Rebel Domination (v)" deck had failed miserably.  I hadn't seen ANY capital ships at all, which are totally required.  So I decided to just forget the idea and try to salvage the horrendous pile that I had.  Currently, there was almost no space, very few ground tricks, and a bunch of T-47s.  I also had the Mara, an EPP Luke, and a Wild Karrde.  <br/>
<br/>
In the last 2 packs, I still wasn't finding any space, and it was fairly ridiculous!  So I decided I'd have to go all ground and ended up with 3 2/2 sites (one of which was a fixed location).  Then I had Yoda Great Warrior (with no immunity to attrition) and a Jedi Lightsaber.  Honestly that was about it!  Also I had no effect that was good enough to start.<br/>
<br/>
For my Wild Karrde pick, there was a lot to choose from, but I just chose Plo Koon (v).  I figured he could pull the Jedi Lightsaber which can add to drains, so he couldn't be bad.  And of course he had a built in force icon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a decklist of sorts... (just some of the cards I remember from the 40 card deck):<br/>
<br/>
Naboo: Boss Nass' Chambers (starting location every game)<br/>
Yavin 4: War Room (unfortunately, these are the 2 worst light twixes in the cube)<br/>
3 2/2 sites (back door, cc: 2/2, cantina)<br/>
EPP Luke<br/>
Plo Koon (v)<br/>
light side Mara Jade<br/>
Yoda Great Warrior<br/>
Senator Mon Mothma<br/>
Comm Wedge Antilles (v)<br/>
Wicket! (never came in handy)<br/>
Jedi Lightsaber<br/>
Dual Laser Cannons (v)<br/>
Weapon Levitation<br/>
Sense (ep1)<br/>
Control &amp; Tunnel Vision<br/>
The Bith Shuffle<br/>
Mindful of the Future<br/>
Rebel Barrier<br/>
Dodge<br/>
Strikeforce (v)<br/>
Dash in Rogue 10<br/>
2 Rogue squad t-47s<br/>
a bunch of other characters and random other stuff I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dark side draft:<br/>
<br/>
Despite how horrible my light side draft went trying to draft a theme, I was still determined to get something going with dark.<br/>
<br/>
My first pack was pretty bad.  I think I took Sim Aloo.  He is not even that good unless you get The Emperor, so I would definitely be on the lookout for him later.  I can't really remember how this draft went exactly.  Early on, I found a great card to base a theme around - Imperial Academy Training (v), which says, "Once per battle, if you have a non-lightsaber weapon there, may use 2 Force to add 4 to your total power."  So this works with non-lightsaber EPPs!  Also, I was finding some decent weapons.<br/>
<br/>
One ship I drafted early was Saber 1, as I had the good SFS cannons that shoot lost.  Unfortunately, I didn't see hardly any space (again!) for this whole draft!  I remember passing on a Mist Hunter (v), but that is about it!  Some people around me were really trying to take all the space.  Again, I never saw a capital ship!  That is insane.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyways, I was able to get some good ground cards early.  I found The Emperor (v) (with no gametext, deploy 6/forfeit 8, power 5) as well as Janus Greejatus.  I got Marquand in Blizzard 6, who works great with a AT-AT Cannon (v), which I also got.  I got a Heavy Fire Zone that could pull the AT-AT Cannon.  I also got an amazing card (some said it was too good for the cube), SE Boba Fett (v) (capture fett).  Then I also got Kir Kanos with Force Pike, and a couple Naboo Blasters and a Naboo Blaster Rifle.  All those cards work well with my theme - Imp Academy Training v.  I was just looking to find one more card... Imperial Stockpile!  That would allow me to have a decent weapon every battle.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up getting a wild karrde, but there was no sighting of the Stockpile, so I was really hoping it was in the Wild Karrde choices instead of in someone else's deck already.  Towards the end of the draft though, I found a card that I didn't know was even in the cube - I Want That Ship (v)!  It was a perfect fit for my deck - "During battle, whenever opponent's card is hit by a non-(permanent weapon icon) (once per card targeted), opponent's total power is cumulatively -4 (-2 if hit by a lightsaber)."  Now I really needed to find that Stockpile, since IWTS v didn't work with my EPPs.<br/>
<br/>
So the draft ends and we get to choose our Wild Karrde.  I was the 2nd person to get to choose after Seth Acree.  I saw him looking at the Stockpile (or at something near it) for a while, but he went with a 2/0 site instead.  Whew!  I asked him later and he said he couldn't have used it.  So I was lucky and got the stockpile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is basically how my dark deck looked:<br/>
<br/>
Executor: Meditation Chamber (starting location)<br/>
Executor: Docking Bay + IAO<br/>
Endor: Back Door + CC: Downtown Plaza (2x 2/2s)<br/>
Emperor + Sim + Janus<br/>
Marquand in Blizz 10 + ATAT Cannon (v)<br/>
Blizzard 1<br/>
Heavy Fire Zone<br/>
Imp Stockpile + Naboo Blaster Rifle<br/>
Imperial Academy Training (v) + I Want That Ship (v) (wow!)<br/>
one starting interrupt to start the Stockpile<br/>
Boba Fett (se) (v)<br/>
Bane Malar<br/>
Dathomir Witch (!)<br/>
Nute Gunray (not a warrior!)<br/>
Image of the Dark Lord (v) (never was useful!)<br/>
SSPFT (v)<br/>
Control &amp; Set For Stun<br/>
Lone Warrior<br/>
Imperial Barrier (I think?)<br/>
NO SPACE! (again! arrgh)<br/>
<br/>
And of course, other stuff I am forgetting...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, lets move on to the games!  I will try to do my best remembering all the details<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
game 1 Dark vrs Kevin Reitzel<br/>
I knew I needed to win as many games as possible with my dark deck to make up for my light deck, but playing against Kevin is never easy (he did top 4 worlds before).<br/>
This game I got off to a good start with some 2/1 drain -1s and getting out my executor docking bay quickly. Kevin did play Restricted Deployment on me though.  I drew a decent bit early on, but couldn't find I Want That Ship (v) or Imperial Academy Training (v), so I just went down to the Endor Back Door with a decent force: Marquand in Blizzard 10 + ATAT Cannon v and some ability 4 guy (Nute Gunray?).  Kevin came down, played &lt;&gt;forest next to the back door, mech failure on marquand, and 4 2/2 rebels.  He also had out Insurrection.  I shot one of his forfeit 5 guys to make him forfeit 3, then drew over 3 for a battle destiny, so he had to lose 2 guys.  He still ended up overpowering me, so I forfeited nute gunray to cover.  He ran his 2 characters to the forest.<br/>
<br/>
On my turn, I played Set for Stun with a tracked card to bounce Wedge Antilles (v) back to his hand, leaving him with some other 2/2 rebel alone.  Then I played The Emperor (v) (remember, his gametext was blanked so no immunity but also no text saying he can't be used offensively) and Sim Aloo and beat down his character for 8 overflow.  Then I moved Marquand over and canceled Mech Failure.  So I had a firm lead at this point and knew I should win, even though I hadn't even been able to use Imperial Stockpile yet!  <br/>
<br/>
The rest of the game was him trying to lower my differential.  He played some characters to the executor to drain which I was able to clean up with Boba Fett (v) + Ice Heart (causing attrition +2 everywhere since Ice-Heart was with a captive).  Of course, there might have been one more battle all game, so it didn't really matter.  He got some small damage in after that, but I still had a solid win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16<br/>
Pros:  Early tracking for the winning Set for Stun!<br/>
Cons: Never finding anything to help with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
game 2 Light vrs Nick Culpepper<br/>
Nick is a very strong player who probably beat me more than anyone else at events last year, so I knew this would be tough.  Also we have had lots of close Cube games in the past.  He starts the Dagobah Cave (bad news for my Yoda!).  We both got out our activation and he setup with ~3 cards at Kessel to drain for 1 all game.  Of course, he couldn't have known I only had one ship which I never found all game.  After some early drawing, I had a pretty solid hand.  2x 2/2 sites, Plo Koon (v), Lobot (v), and Dodge.  So I played the cc: 2/2 site with Lobot (v), since there was an adjacent 2/1 drain -1 cc site already (for running away with dodge if necessary), and Plo Koon (v) + Jedi Lightsaber to the Cantina (as there were 3 tatooine sites at that time).  I also had Senator Mon Mothma at one of those other tatooine sites and some backup for Plo Koon at the Cantina.  He drained me for 1 his turn, but couldn't do anything to stop my big drains.  I got to verify his deck sometime and saw that he was playing a heavy space deck.  Luckily for me, he didn't get any drain 2 system out this game (not sure if he had one but he probably did).  I drained for 5 or 6 my next turn and reinforced Lobot with Dash in Rogue 10 and an empty Rogue 2.  I was hoping to use Lobot to react with Phylo Gandish (v) as a pilot on Rogue 2 in order to use Dash's gametext if he battled me there.  Well he did battle me there with Galen and Cyborg Commander, but I missed my Lobot pull.  I had 3 saved force to play Phylo, but she was one of those 3.  I ended up not killing anything with a low battle destiny, while I lost my empty rogue 2.  I don't remember this exactly, but eventually I had to play Yoda to help battle at the cloud city 2/2.  I had been draining for a lot at the cantina which he hadn't been able to contest and had gotten a slight advantage there.  He was very happy about being able to cause damage for the rest of the game with the Dagobah Cave, but I figured that if it gave me the drain of 2 all game, it was worth it.  And sure enough, he didn't draw battle destiny so that I couldn't lose yoda and then he ran his remaining character (galen) away the next turn.  Ends up though, that my drains after that were just too much.  I ended up killing Galen with a tracked 5 and won.<br/>
<br/>
FW +9<br/>
Pros: Getting a win with my light deck!  If I can somehow nab one more then maybe I have a shot in this event.<br/>
Cons:  Not many.<br/>
<br/>
game 3 Light vrs Mike Kessling<br/>
Playing versus Mike is always a challenge.  He just top 8ed the MPC, which I think was a surprise to everyone except us.  Mike also pretty much always wins Cube events and I was picking him to win this one as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I am honestly having a hard time remembering everything I need to about this game.  Basically as far as I remember, we start out real slow (a common theme amongst good cube players) and wait for each other to make a move.  He goes to a space system with a handful of cards.  My next turn I play a decent force to a 2/2 site... The drain race has begun!  His deck was balanced, space and ground, so he played Battle Order, which gave him a large advantage.  Its extremely hard imo to win if you have to pay to drain in the cube.  The only chance I had was that my drains were somewhat larger, as I quickly went to a 2nd 2/2 site with a Jedi Lightsaber on Yoda Great Warrior.  He had some force on ground as well and there was a light amount of battling.  The two key plays were when I canceled a control with yoda great warrior that was played to cancel one of my drains of 3 (thus, a net gain of 2 force for me) and when I grabbed a barrier he played on one of my characters to an empty site.  I didn't know it at the time, but he needed to recycle a 4 to track to trample an ability 3 guy I had at one of the 2/2 sites I was draining at.  His next turn, he attacked with his ATAT and some backup (I forget what I had at the site, sorry!) and searched his reserve to see that there was no destiny &gt; 3 card to use with trample.  Ends up I cleared his guys and kept the drain to close out the game, despite having to pay for battle order.<br/>
FW +4<br/>
Pros:  Making some key plays with the limited information that I had.<br/>
Cons:  Battle Order!<br/>
<br/>
game 4 Dark vrs Andrew Morris<br/>
At this point Andrew and I were the only undefeated players.  Of course I am relieved to be able to play him with my dark side, but someone mentioned before the game how his light side is really good, so I was a bit worried.  Andrew likes to play odd decks, and this cube draft was a perfect place for him to do it.  Both his decks were a bit crazy...  His light side starting Bespin + West Gallery (2/1 drain -1) using Careful Planning.  Of course I had no space, so seeing this balanced start meant that he would have an advantage if he played Battle Plan.  I started my 2/0, so we each got 4 icons at the start.  I played some good activation sites quickly and eventually went to the Endor Back Door with The Emperor + janus + backup.  He never ended up contesting that drain all game.  On the other hand, he played Projection of a Skywalker on it and Dash Rendar (v) + Outrider to space with Figrin D'an on board it.  His control of Bespin made it so all my characters + vehicles would deploy +1 to CC sites.  Add to that how to quickly played Battle Plan and I had to save 2 force for my Naboo Blaster Rifle plus 2 and I was really force choked.  This game I found I Want That Ship (v) quickly, but ended up losing Imperial Academy Training (v) off the reserve to his first drain.  <br/>
<br/>
What I didn't notice immediately was that he was playing only aliens.  So a little while into the game he played Baragwin (v), and I knew I would be in trouble if I couldn't kill it.  Baragwin (v) is a cube only card that says "If present at a battleground site, your Force drains at battleground sites where you have two aliens are +1, and when you deploy an alien, retrieve 1 Force."  He had a fairly solid group of aliens on the ground with the Baragwin, including Melas (v), and I didn't have much in my hand to battle with.  I had played Boba Fett (v) (capture fett) to another CC site early to do some successful battling, so I moved Fett in front of his group and had Lone Warrior as backup in hand.  He must have known I had something to go with Fett if he battled, because he ran his guys away and drew for backup.  I knew Figrin and Baragwin (v) would end up killing me if I couldn't kill Baragwin.  So eventually I did kill his baragwin, after missing one Naboo Blaster Rifle shot on it (0 for destiny!).  He actually had drafted both though, and played the other (pulled with Nar Shadda Wind Chimes) and moved some characters from Bespin down to the Bespin docking bay as backup.  The key though was that one of those characters was Figrin D'an!  He said after the game, "Who battles with Figrin D'an?"  Sure enough, some more battles happened, and I killed Figrin.  <br/>
<br/>
I paid to drain every turn, but he still had some drains and decent retrieval so the game was very close and I was heavily force choked.  There were quite a few turns where if I had enough force I could have played Marquand in Blizzard 6 + ATAT Cannon (v) to possibly cause some overflow but I never had enough force.  I ended up having to lose the ATAT cannon as well (to keep a high destiny on top of reserve), so that opportunity didn't last.  <br/>
<br/>
In the end, I was able to use some cheaper deploy characters to kill the last Baragwin and eek out a win.<br/>
FW +7<br/>
Pros:  Having a dark deck based on weapons so that I had a shot to kill the Baragwin (v)!<br/>
Cons:  Being force choked.<br/>
<br/>
game 5 Light vrs Andrew Morris<br/>
The 4th game had been very close and almost went to time, so while it was exciting, it was also mentally draining.  This game was like that as well, but even moreso!  Andrew's dark deck was similar to his light one, with odd cards used in odd ways to create some very interesting situations.  He started the JP: Lower Passages and Imperial Academy Training (v).  I knew that he had drafted from my cube, and I knew there were some really cool interactions with that card in it, so I was interested to see what he had put together.  The first part of this game was a bit crazy.  For some reason, I thought I had Weapon Levitation in hand, so I was figured out when the Jedi Lightsaber would be in my force pile, used all my force deploying Yoda Great Warrior + backup to the Cantina, and went to play Weapon Lev to get the lightsaber on Yoda for a drain of 3.  BUT there was no Weapon Lev in my hand!!  Then I started to question myself a lot... Had I played it to cycle it back into my deck?  No... Had I dropped it?  Well it wasn't on the floor...  I really have no clue what I had been thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, he hadn't played any good drain site, but had played all tatooine locations, so I knew that if I kept ahold of the Cantina I would have an early advantage.  Also, we had both played tons of locations early, and none were systems, so I was pretty sure he was playing no space just like me (this assumption was correct).  In response to my drain of 2 at the cantina, he just played some light forces to 2 tatooine drain 1 sites, including 2 Elite Squadron Stormtrooper (v)s, which have built in weapons to use with Imperial Academy Training (v).  Very cool combo!  Then he soon played Lieutenant Cecius (v), who says "At battlegrounds where you have a unique (?) and non-unique Imperial present (and no other Force drain bonus), your Force drains are +1."  An even better combo!  And sure enough, he was setup to drain my for 5 after that.  Well 5 is greater than 2, so I knew I needed to find my Jedi Lightsaber or Plo Koon (v) to pull it so that I could hit Cecius.  I felt like if I did that, then I could pretty easily win the game.  Well, I had Control &amp; Tunnel Vision in hand, and had figured out that once I activated Plo Koon should be there, with a small chance the jedi lightsaber would be too (especially if I activated too many).  So I just activated the smallest amount to play Plo + saber + battle, played Tunnel Vision, and took Plo (v).  Then I realized I needed one more force since I had taken one out of my force pile to do what I had to do.  So I activate one more, deploy Plo, go to pull the saber... and sure enough it was the one extra force.  I suppose it wouldn't have mattered much if I had activated the right amount originally, except I could have grabbed the saber with the Tunnel Vision and searched for a warrior to play it on later.  Anyways, I had really screwed up the game at this point and was under a lot of pressure from his large drains.  So I went to the CC: Downtown Plaza (drain 2) and kept trying to block his largest drains on Tatooine when it was safe.  I also eventually found the Jedi Lightsaber, but he would just run Cecius away from it.  Our drains were about equal the whole game, and we had exactly equal life force + hand, so there was no room for any (more) errors on my part.  Ends up though, that it didn't really matter.  At the end, he was able to spread more than I could handle, and his Cecius (v) enhanced drains were too much to stop.  He had blocked some of my drains towards the end, while I couldn't do anymore to his, and that was what won him the game.<br/>
FL -5<br/>
Pros:  Umm... it was a close fun game!<br/>
Cons:  Lots of them!  I don't know what I was thinking all game... I made a lot of silly mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
game 6 Dark vrs Graham Bingham<br/>
I knew I would have to win this to guarantee a place in the final confrontation.  There were 3 of us who had only lost one game (myself, Andrew, and Graham) and Brian Herold was at the top of the 2 loss players (playing against Andrew this game).  If Brian won and I lost by a very small amount, then maybe Graham and I could be in the finals, but I didn't want to count on that opportunity.  Also, Graham won one of our last Cube tournaments, so I knew not to take this game lightly.  Also, he had gotten the bye game 1 and had watched my game vrs Kevin, so he knew some about my deck, but he didn't know that I had I Want That Ship (v) and Imperial Academy Training (v) (since I hadn't found them that game).  <br/>
<br/>
This game began very very slowly :)  I mean, we were playing slowly.  I found one of my drain 2 locations early on, but he had played his own back door and hadn't immediately occupied it.  All the other locations were drain 1 for both of us (except if he had a spy to go to my boss nass chambers).  So I decided, since I had a decent ground force, to try to just take over his back door, and once he went to fight me there, I would reinforce while also taking the Downtown Plaza I had in my hand.  So I played The Emperor + Sim Aloo + Vader's Cape (on the Emperor) to his back door.  I had also tracked a 5 and a 4 that I knew were on top of my reserve if he attacked me, which would have resulted in a total battle destiny of 11!  Early tracking is more easily possible in the cube than in constructed (if you know how to play it) and I think it is crucial to success.  Anyways, he didn't attack me there and went instead to a drain 1 location with four 2/2 rebels and projectioned my drain.  I think I just ignored that drain for a turn and setup my hand (searching for Janus actually).  He also had Insurrection, so there was little chances of me beating him down unless I could pull off some nice tricks.  His turn he played Obi Padawan Learner to an adjacent drain 1 tatooine site (" If opponent just initiated a battle at a related Tatooine site, may use 2 Force to relocate Obi-Wan to that site!") and I think 3 characters as backup with him.  So I played set for stun on one of these backup characters in his draw phase (since I had a tracked 4 on top).  Then on my turn I activated back to the 4, played capture fett with some backup, and battled.  I had also played I Want That Ship (v) and Imperial Academy Training (v) (finally found them both in the same game!).  So I was able to kill (or send to used with Boba) all his characters except Obi.  Around this time, we found out there was only about 15 minutes left, and we had been doing almost no damage to each other.  I felt like if the game went on longer I would win, so I started rushing things.  I played all my turns very very quickly, but I don't think I made any mistakes and was instead thinking very clearly.  He tried over and over to kill Boba Fett, but it just didn't work.  I always had some sort of answer and would often overpower him because of my helper effects (which was of course offset by Insurrection some of the time).  Towards the 10 minute mark, I finally found Janus, which let me get ahead in the drain race and I knew I would win.  I kept up with tracking and he couldn't clear me off the other site he wanted to drain at on tatooine.  Since I hadn't played any other location for him to drain for 2 at, that sealed the win in my favor.<br/>
FW +11<br/>
Pros:  Winning a close, hard fought game!  Also, the Emperor + friends + tracking.<br/>
Cons:  Not having enough time to play the game out liesurely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And with that I was into the finals!  I really didn't think I would be able to with my poor light deck, but having 3 different drain 2 locations along with the Jedi Lightsaber had really helped out more than I thought it would.  Ends up that Andrew beat Brian and was headed to the finals as well, but he didn't want to play them because he had to meet up with a girl (eww, girls!!!).  So we decided to share the championship, with him taking the v-card and me the worlds bye.  Also I figure that if we played the finals, he would have had the advantage because he would know that he didn't need to stock up in space at Bespin with his light side.  At the same time, maybe I would have been able to kill Cecius (v)!  Who knows how it would have turned out...<br/>
<br/>
We ended up having a lot of fun, and there were pretty good prizes (I hope everyone got some cards they wanted).  There will definitely be a Southeastern Cube Championship 2012! <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
