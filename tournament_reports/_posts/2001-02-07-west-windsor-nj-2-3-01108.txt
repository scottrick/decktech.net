<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Reflections 2 Box tournament Results - Gamers Realm, West Windsor NJ (Feb 3, 2001)<br>
<br>
First of all I want to thank everyone for the great turnout and hopefully this trend can continue.  We had some players show up for the first time in a while (TJ Holman), some long distance travellers (Steve and Jeff Brentson), and even some new players!  Coruscant Regional Co-Champion John<br>
Lolli even made an appearance since becoming a casual player (He traded the rest of his cards at this tournament and even used decks that I supplied him.  He did have a good time though, which was great!)<br>
<br>
A Huge thanks to Blythe Hermley-Keen that has countless times helped SM’s and TD’s run events flawlessly and helped me again today!<br>
<br>
Decks varied this tournament.<br>
<br>
Everything from HB Tatooine Celebration, Xwing Swarm (HB and EBO varients), Watch Your Step and Anti Scum Profit for the light.  Dark side ran a good amount of Scum (MKOS &amp; SYCFA), BHBM beats, Tie Swarm, and even a Ev 9d9 Torture deck (he didn’t realize you could not capture your own droids, which made for a fun conversation!)<br>
<br>
Dark Side Wins -21<br>
Dark Side Modified Wins -3<br>
Dark Side Byes-2<br>
Light Side Wins - 24<br>
Light Side Modified Wins -0<br>
