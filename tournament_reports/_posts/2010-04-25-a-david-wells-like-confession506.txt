<blockquote><font class="bfont"> A David Wells-Like Confession Or How I Won A Consolation Event On Cookies And Beer<br>
<br>
One of the advantages to hotel events for those of us who like to drink while we play is: We can do just that.<br>
<br>
Here is the account of my Saturday as best as I can remember it. My game details are a little sketchy and some of my games were rather non-interactive (sorry to my opponents if I screw anything up). For decks I played a ReidTech style TRM and Objective Walkers (Lists available in part 1 of the MPC deck lists). Also, this is going to be fairly long (It was 5 pages in word when I finished writing it) so you may want to grab some beer and get ready to sit for awhile....or read it in installments....or not at all.<br>
<br>
I started out Saturday wanting to keep the clearest possible head for a hopeful run deep into the Main Event.  However, I didn't feel my opponent should be as sensible.<br>
<br>
Round 1 vs. Jerry "Quesosauce" Heine<br>
<br>
I told Jerry the night before that I was going to greet him with some beer in the morning.  So about a half-hour prior to starting the round I am with The Sauce and hand him some sauce (in this case three cans of Yuengling (I would supply him with more through the course of the weekend as well)) in hopes that he would take my offering and I could walk though the first round.  He happily took the beers but didn't start drinking until we had started playing thus giving me no real mental advantage. Going into the weekend  I thought there were two decks I wasn't going to be excited to play against and were my weakest match-ups HD (v) -- It turned out to be way wrong on that going 3-for-3 against the objective on the weekend -- and Profit...Jerry played both:<br>
<br>
Game 1 TRM vs. Jerry's HD (v)<br>
<br>
Early on the game consists of him trying to set up Watto's Junkyard and me clearing him off.  He eventually stacks some characters there including Galen and Guri.  Meanwhile I set up some ships at Kiffex and Tantive to Coruscant.  He plays Program Trap to stop the Coruscant drain and Restraining Bolt  on Threepio to stop my cycling.  With the junkyard fortressed I decide to go to the Cloud City: Lower Corridor and try and hold there.  That doesn't work either has he comes down with Vader and a few friends.  I'm worried for about a minute as I now have no ground presence despite being fairly ahead in the game from a constant space drain.  Jerry then plays his lone copy of "Why Didn't You Tell Me (v)" which opened an easy path to victory for me.  I grab the interrupt with Strikeforce and on the next turn drop IL-19 Corran Horn and Lando to the Bridge.  I drain for 5 a turn the rest of the game while keeping him flipped.  In an effort to lower my diff he drops J'quille to the Bridge makes me lose some force and battles overflowing himself to end the game.  I win by a moderate amount, say about +14.<br>
<br>
Game 2 Walkers vs. Jerry's Profit<br>
<br>
In play testing I played a few close games against profit, all loses.  This game was close and I won on the back of a few mistakes by opponent and a  key sense.  First turn I set up Darth Vader (v) at the Hoth system via combat response.  His first turn he dropped Obi to the Audiance Chamber.  Turn two I play Tempest 1 to the fifth marker with an at-at cannon and landed Vader to pilot saving one force for a barrier.  His turn two is where he makes his first mistake, he flips before I have caused any damage.   He retrives one force and I lose one to the objective and he drops Yoda, GW and uses DDTA to get what turns out to be his lone Imperial Atrocity (v).  Turn three I blow the generator and he plays Atrocity.  I counter with control and he makes his second big mistake, he uses Yoda to cancel the control.  The game gets a little boring from here as we both just set up on our own sites and deal direct damage and drains to each other.  He eventually sets up enough to come after me with Boushh,  her gun and master Luke. He manages to clear a walker but I just dance around them the rest of the game.   By this point i had dealt so much damage that it didn't matter.  As a last ditch effort to steal the match he tries to play On the Edge, but I quickly announce sense to seal the deal.  As a side note after I sensed Edge  he played  his Do, Or Do Not shield which was signed by Kevin Shannon and says something along the lines of: "If Jerry plays this after you sense something slap him 37 times."  I win the game by about 12 and I still owe Jerry some slaps...thanks Kevin.<br>
<br>
Round 2 vs Matt Sokol:<br>
<br>
Matt has become my arch nemesis .  Don't get me wrong.  Matt is a great guy, I love playing against him but I am now 1-5 against him lifetime and he has a habit of kicking me out of major events.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 TRM vs. Matt's ISB Drop, Drain, And apparently beat things senseless<br/>
<br/>
Matt flips over ISB Objective and plays Look Sir, Droids for Kuat Drive Yards and Location x3.  So I immediately think ISB Drop and Drain.  However, I have only seen the deck in decklist form and decide that I will have a good time slowly picking apart his ground forces.  This was not the correct way to play it.  The first few turns we both set up.  I get out twixes he puts down Tatooine sites   and draws a massive hand.  I play Grimtash USED...another mistake.  He draws up a bunch of cards again and then starts to deploy everything he needs.  Maul to the system and characters to the ground.  On what I think ws turn four I dropped EPP Obi to the Cantina against 3 ISB agents.  He gets barried.  I then play Luke and Leia, RP.  I battle and clear some of his characters and resilienced  Luke.  The next turn he drains and then proceeds to deploy (yes I had professor shield out) a plethora of pi√±atas...i mean a horde isb agents along with the droid that adds two to their power under nighttime conditions.  To make this quick he had power 50 and I drew a 0 for destiny.  I basically peeled off the rest of my deck.  There is nothing I can do and I draw up.  I lose by about 24.<br/>
I quickly think about just conceding the match and playing in the EPP event, but I am convinced to play it out even though I know my walkers can't win by 25.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Walkers vs. Matt's TRM<br/>
<br/>
I play really quick and decide to take as many chances as I can.  I get set up fairly quick for the blow.  Meanwhile he has set up a good drain at Hoth system and gets down honor.  I blow the generators  but all my direct damage is getting reduced by honor.  I eventually drive him from the system with some ships, Vader, Zuckuss, Saber 1.  He moves over to Kiffex and to try and block as much damage as possible I move over Vader and Zuckuss.  However I leave no force and Matt drops a beat squad on Saber 1 including Gold Leader in Gold 1 (v).  I peel the rest of my deck.  I lose by about 20.  There was one highlight for me in this game.  Early on I barriered one of his characters. He tried to sense it and I proceeded to win a six card sac war. <br/>
<br/>
Our two games took less than the 1:15 minutes allotted for one game in this format.  So I had plenty of time to kill between rounds.  I end up sitting down to lunch with some people. including Chris Schoenthal, Mike Pistone and Sokol. After that there was still some time to kill so I headed back to my room where my cooler was filled with Yuengling and Miller Light.  Having just had lunch I decide on some sweet and grab some Soft Batch cookies I had brought with me.  I then also decide I have nothing to lose and to take a play out of the Jim Li/Jan Westergard play book:  I crack open a Miller Lite.  I head back downstairs and register for the consolation event.  I notice my beer is empty so I go back upstairs and grab a second arriving back downstairs in time for the first round to start.  I am playing the same decks as I did in the main event:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Walkers vs. Carl Buck's WYS Raiders<br/>
<br/>
Carl got eliminated in the first round and apparently began the booze strategy early as well.  He must have been on his third bucket of long necks by the time we played and didn't seem to care much about the game but we had a good time nonetheless.  He gets a jump on the Hoth system.  I have trouble finding a card that will pull Vader and have to set up Maul on tempest 1 and blow the generators. The rest of the game goes like a typical match against WYS.  I drive him off the system with a big fleet of some combination of Darth Vader v, Black 2 v, Saber 1 and/or Zuckuss v.  I eventually draw my Arica non-v  and block the Cantina drain.  As I am deploying her Mike Gemme decides it would be a good idea to  turn off the lights in the room.  Everyone groans, several inappropriate comments are made, someone puts a tongue in my ear and I exclaim that I haven't had enough to drink yet to allow that to happen.... Maybe the last two things didn't happen, but eventually the lights get back on and Mr. Buck has an extra reserve deck.  I don't notice it at first but Carl cracks a grin and turns his loss pile he had flipped over back face up and we continue.  The rest of the game is smooth sailing for me as he never comes to challenge me on Hoth.  I play Walker Garrison and Limited Resources to end the game.  FW.<br/>
<br/>
After the game we have about 10 minutes before parings are called.  It's getting close to a traditional dinner time and I decide I need a snack.  So I run back up to my room grab some cookies, and decide I am thirsty.  I grab another beer and head back down for..<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  TRM vs. Dave McCune's HD v Space<br/>
<br/>
As Mentioned, Dave's deck is with a space focus and from what I remember this game goes fairly quick.  He has some trouble drawing his space cards and early on we swap characters on the ground clearing the site he plays.  Meanwhile I drop Tantive v with Luke w/ Saber to Coruscant and Super Home One to Kiffex with Bright Hope.  He takes control of ground and then tries to go to Fondor but I still have plenty of ships and continually beat him off of it.  Eventually I get IL-19 to the Bridge and drain him out for the win.  FW.<br/>
<br/>
Cookies and Beer have worked twice so far.   So I figure to see if it can go 3-for-3.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 TRM vs. Scott Diehl ISB Drop, Drain, and I now know how to beat this deck.<br/>
<br/>
At first I moan at the match-up, but I gotta give it a try. Scott is running basically the same deck as Sokol so I have an idea of what not to do this time.  I remember that Location x3 lets me pull locations as well and I use it to grab Kiffex and set up a drain there.  He draws a huge hand and I play Grimtaash...LOST, which gets grabbed.  He loses at least two maul's ship, around 6 characters cards, two sunsdown and likely some interrupts.  He has one Maul's ship left and he has to dig through most of his force file to get the ship.  I set up Super Home one with a high ability character (maybe Corran) at Tatooine. On his next turn he plays Sunsdown and I cancel it with Houjix.  He also plays Maul and ship to Tatooine and as many characters as he can to site and saves no force.   With DTF down I drop Obi and Screaming Lando against a lone character.  Game over.  FW.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel bad that I picked Scott apart so easily.  He's a good guy and was basically smiling through the whole game.   But I am relieved that I can handle that deck now.  I counted differential on that game just to check for myself, I won by 30. Cookies and Beer are doing the trick so I make another run to my room and head back to the tournament for...<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Walkers vs. Chris Twigg's LTWW TRM<br/>
<br/>
I have a tough game getting Vader down to blow up the generators.   However I am able to settle for Maul, who I deploy without his ship fairly early.  I luck out and don't get early pressure on Hoth and blow the generators.  In the meantime he had set up a decent fleet with Tantive v and Bright Hope at Hoth hitting me for three a turn.  He then drops Luke, JK to the Rebel landing Site with his saber.  I slowly set up walkers on Hoth stacking two sites and I drop Arica to block Luke's drain.  I eventually build up my fleet with Barron, Vader and Zuckuss and he flees Kiffex.  I spread my walkers on Hoth to try and get in Walker Garrison.  He uses Sorry About The Mess to get rid of Arica and on my lone Cyclone Walker he plays Corran and Melas v and battles.  I try to use Outflank v but he says I can't as we are the same power (and he's right, we were both power 5).  I lose the walker.   I can't remember if I play around Melas and Corran or if he moves them to a site where I beat them off and clear them, but that's not important or game changing.  On my next turn I drop another walker use my objective to get back Arica and use her to block Luke's drain again.  The extra walker also helps me set up Garrison and Limited Resources and I out damage for another win.  FW.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I don't want to lose my buzz and change my mental state as I am in the zone.  So it was back to the room for cookies and a beer.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Walkers vs. Cole Lepine's WYS Spies<br/>
I got excited in this game because I opened with Arica in my hand.  I was like: 'yes, I'm gonna block the cantina drain all game."  Early on in the game he top decks Boushh and then I am like "Oh no, he's playing spies."  Sure enough when he goes to set up the Cantina one of the characters he plays is Corran and Arica becomes one of the first cards I lose to a drain there.  Early game he sets up Dash and BoShek at Hoth.  I again have trouble finding a way to get down Vaderbut eventually do so and blow the generator.   He plays atrocity but I have a control handy.  The game is mostly non-interactive but I top deck DS-61-2 early and never find time to get him back.  So getting desperate from eating drains of 2 and 2 (Decree was in effect to cancel BoShek's adder) I drop a massive fleet to Hoth with Zuckuss, Vader, Barron and General Veers v piloting Black 2 v.  His ships run to Tatooine.  I play Black Leader and Darth Maul to block the cantina drain and spread out to set up Walker Garrison.    He debates coming after me on Hoth but doesn't and sets up a drain to the Tatooine: Docking Bay.  Maul and Black Leader get battled away.  My turn I play Garrison and Limited Resources and that's the game.  FW.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, it's basically tradition. I also have a really active sweet tooth, so I grab some cookies and beer and am back for....<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Chris Twigg's HDv Tanks<br/>
<br/>
I kinda moan at this match as well.  I never like playing against tanks, I find them somewhat annoying to deal with.  However I never have to deal with them in this game, as playing against HD v has becomes somewhat formulaic.  He sets up two sites, Endor: Forest Clearing and Hoth: Third Marker with Galen at one and Vader at another (projection gets played on one of them). Early I get a good Grimtaash in  and he loses two Galens in addition to four other cards to it.  I get Kiffex early and set up a consistent drain of 2.  I play Tantive to Coruscant, but he program traps.  With most of his power characters committed to sites already I play IL-19 (has anyone mentioned this card is dumb?) and some characters to the Bridge to keep him flipped.   I am winning the damage race but the game is still close.  I threepio hard for the Lower Corridor and get it.  I set up Qui-Gon there and play On The Edge to retrieve 5.  He scoops on his next turn.  FW.<br/>
<br/>
So I am the only undefeated and win the tournament.  I know we started with 47 people and finished with significantly fewer than that but I am still somewhat proud of my accomplishment.  I know my games weren't the most interesting, so I have likely just wasted most people's time (Fool you once shame on me....if you read this twice you need to get a life.) but I felt I would share anyway. As I wrote earlier this was at 5 pages long so I also didn't feel the need to go back and edit this or send it to any of my editors.  So please excuse any poor grammar.<br/>
