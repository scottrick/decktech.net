<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Ok, so I get lucky in being able to drive only 50 minutes to the<br>
tournament from Ramapo College instead of the 1 1/2 hour travelling from<br>
my home in Trenton. 8).  On the drive to NYC I had the luck of having some<br>
freaky people look at my and even walk up to my car. 8).<br>
<br>
<br>
So I get the play some fun games against Lolli and Bart Robinson and<br>
decide with them Woj, and Hodur to get Micky D's for lunch.  Knowing the<br>
tournament was going to start a little late it gave me a chance to say hi<br>
to the Albany guys, Philly guys and gal, and other assorted people I<br>
haven't seen since school.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just so everyone knows my decks-<br>
        Light Side- 'Juz's Revenge'<br>
        Dark Side- 'Anktopot Part V'<br>
<br>
Game 1-My LS Vs Brian Twig's (2074)Beatdown HuntDown<br>
<br>
I will follow Mike Dalton's approach to describing this game similar to<br>
the Hak Soo talk about Wounded Wookie...<br>
<br>
About halfway through this game I wonder why Twig started Resistance<br>
against me.  He mentions that the whole Albany crew will sit around and<br>
discuss what to start versus certain people...Of course when my name and<br>
discuss what to start versus certain people...Of course when my name and<br>
light side comes up, 'Resistance'  always is the answer.<br>
<br>
The game was close for a while but, then he came out ahead...<br>
<br>
FL 0(-18)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Watching Brian Twig sweat about how much to activate at one<br/>
point.<br/>
Lowlights- Resistance!!!  Who the heck starts with that card 8).<br/>
<br/>
Ok so the tournament is not starting off but I am feeling better knowing I<br/>
can still go 5-1.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2-My DS Vs Adam Liu's (1806) Yavin Revolver<br/>
<br/>
I start Crush and pull an evader early.  He starts dropping sites and<br/>
nudjs.  For about 20 turns no one did anything but take Visage damage.  It<br/>
didn't help that I lost my only battleground to Visage and that he didn't<br/>
play any.  After a while he Grimed me for my two evaders and that wasn't<br/>
good.  Luckily CHYBC was out so even if he did drain, it would be<br/>
cancelled.  Eventually I wanted to get some interaction so I dropped<br/>
Tempest Scout 3 at the Executor DB and waited.  His turn, he revo's it and<br/>
drops a beat squad.  I lose the Scout and 10.  No problem.  He moves to<br/>
the Med Chamber and the game then turns into Vader and Dengar beating up<br/>
on some Rebels.  One highlight of the game was Dengar with gun chilling at<br/>
the Executor DB. He drops Chewbacca, Wedge, and RL in R1.  Battles, I lose<br/>
2 with DTF and First Strike out, he doesn't retrieve.  I shoot Wedge,<br/>
Chewie, play Res Luk Rauf and drop a 6 for destiny.  I lose Dengar, he<br/>
loses everyone 8).  Eventually I place the objective out of play and drain<br/>
at the revoed site.  I get EPP Vader draining from there when he drops EPP<br/>
Luke.  Battles, I lose 2.  He misses Vader, I hit Luke, play I have you<br/>
now and draw something like 11 attrition.  He sacs Luke and doesn't draw<br/>
destiny.  That pretty much ends the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+11)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights-Pulling the game out of my butt.<br/>
Lowlights- No interaction for the first 20 turns.<br/>
<br/>
So the next game starts and....<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-My LS Vs Adam Liu's (1806) EJP Dark Objective<br/>
<br/>
I start my Yavin Throne Room and He plays The stuff for the Dark Obi.  He<br/>
immediately thinks Revo with Sac so he starts Oppressive Enforcement.  8).<br/>
I go get the Farm and Swamp.  My first turn I drop Artoo at the Sarlac<br/>
Pit and Draw.  Him thinking Gift gets out the Jabbas Palace and the Rancor<br/>
Pit.  Draws.  My turn I drop 8d8 at the throne room and insert.  8)  At<br/>
this point he never saw it coming. 8).  His turn he activates, it pops, he<br/>
loses 11.  He drops Jabba at the AC.  My turn EPP Leia comes and visits<br/>
hits Jabba with the gun and draws a 5 destiny.  Jabba Draws a 0 so Leia<br/>
lives.  He has to lose 5 more.  His turn he drops Vader, Tarkin, and<br/>
Jquille.  I lose Leia and ten.  The rest of the game, I spend draining<br/>
from JP for 2 with EPP Luke and inserting while he drains for 1 from the<br/>
AC hoping I would go there. 8)  Nah.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+18~)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights-Making him lose 16 cards in the first few turns.<br/>
Lowlights- Leia getting a beatdown +10.<br/>
<br/>
So I am really feeling good about things now and I get paired against my<br/>
buddy Greg Hodur.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4-My DS Vs Greg Hodur's (1761) TJ Tech LS Force Choke.<br/>
<br/>
I start IAO with everything and he starts the Yavin IV.  I start to pull<br/>
out DB's and then Drop IG-88 down at the D* DB.  I also drop Dlots.  Next<br/>
turn I replace Dlots with EPP Vader and he OOC's Vader.  No problem 8).  I<br/>
draw.  He drops EPP Obi, clashes IG and then I play Put All Sections on<br/>
Obi so he cant swing or draw destiny.  He draws.  My turn I drop Dengar<br/>
with Gun, First Strike and Put All Sections again.  He makes a sense.<br/>
Dang!!!  I decide anyway to battle and hit obi.  He swings at Vader and<br/>
Misses.  I shoot with Dengar and miss, but play Jabba's Through with you<br/>
to Add a destiny.  I then Unexpected Interrupted for IHYK and play that<br/>
to. I ended up losing Vader but he lost Obi and 15.  I like those odds.<br/>
After that I Start draining from D* DB with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and IG.<br/>
I end up draining him 1 to his 2 while we both also lose to Visage each<br/>
turn.  I am ahead from the Big Battle with Obi before.  He is getting the<br/>
two drain from killing the Nudj's and Draining at one with EPP Luke and<br/>
the other with EPP Han and Chewbacca.  Eventually I get Tempest Scout 3<br/>
and 6 down to Chewie and Han, Trample Chewie.  Battle, retrieve and draw a<br/>
5 destiny.  That pretty much ends the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+8~)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights-3rd time I have had Vader OOC'd and won all three.<br/>
Lowlights- Having IG Clashed when I would have liked that extra destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5-My DS Vs Matt Ehrhart's (1858) Speeder Ops.<br/>
<br/>
I start Battle Plan and he starts with Yarna...go figure 8).<br/>
My first turn I drop Vader at the Farm and flips.  Eventually he drops<br/>
some speeders to beatdown Vader.  I lose Vader and 5.  I put down Dlots<br/>
and a swoop and start following.  I also drop Dengar with him and at-st's<br/>
for backup.  I eventually Beat all of his speeders but one site and Fett<br/>
in Slave 1 at the planet.  In the meantime a well placed CAssualt and<br/>
First Strike held me dominate this game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+30)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights-Making Speeders forfiet=0 with Dengar.<br/>
Lowlights-None.<br/>
<br/>
So now with that win, I am starting to feel as though I might have a shot<br/>
at a respectable 5-1 that I was going for but one problem stood in the<br/>
way- Marco Habert.<br/>
<br/>
I have only played Marco one other time and that was the Philly Grand Slam<br/>
with my Dark.  I won that game so I was hoping this would continue the<br/>
trend.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6-My LS Vs Marco Habert's (1912) Endor Ops with Ominous Rumors.<br/>
<br/>
I get the Yavin Start and he wonders if this deck is another rip off of<br/>
Twigs force choke deck...I assure him its not 8).<br/>
<br/>
I get a ton of force first turn and drop Artoo at the landing platform.<br/>
He saves up some force then put the Big E with Lennox (or such) at Endor<br/>
with Ominous Rumors.  My turn I drop a Gold Squad with Landing Claw, 8d8<br/>
at the Jungle and insert.  His turn he activates and drops Devastator and<br/>
cancels landing claw.  Knowing I needed to get that back I drop DTF, Red<br/>
Leader and another Gold Squad.  I battle, retrieve the Claw and draw a 6<br/>
for destiny.  I have to lose the gold squad and he loses the Devastator.<br/>
I think he has Gravity Shadow so I move the gold squad first and then RL<br/>
in R1 but no shadow 8).  His turn the odds pops and he loses 11.  He then<br/>
brings Mara to come to the Farm.  I bring obi out he plays barrier, I<br/>
play Skywalkers to cancel it 8) I then drop EPP Leia and beat up on Mara.<br/>
I lose Leia, He loses Mara.  He Eventually drops Fett in<br/>
Slave 1 to Kashyyyk is starting to get confidence back. I end up dropping<br/>
EPP Luke, EPP Leia, Tantive and Spiral down against Fett.  I battle<br/>
retrieve, play Skywalkers and beat the crap out of the Fettster.  Game<br/>
came quickly after that. 8)  I had fun.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Hightlights-Third time I have used this deck against Endor Ops all wins of<br/>
27 or more.<br/>
Lowlights-forgot to get out the nudjes.<br/>
So over all I ended up coming in 3rd place behind Steve Brentson and Dan<br/>
Sokol.  I felt good to play well again with light side. 8). I ended up<br/>
taking a Luke Foil for my prize with some other Reflections rares.  As for<br/>
the Luke, It is going to be up for grabs to the RamapoCon II Champion<br/>
during RamapoCon II at Ramapo College.  It was a long tournament and much<br/>
thanks to everyone that put a lot of effort into making the craziness<br/>
settle down.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone at RamapoCon.  Here is the info-<br/>
