<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Viper Strikes Back - Tatooine Regionals, 6/22/02<br>
<br>
Wow... I’m actually writing another TR. Who woulda thought? ;-) I’ve decided that I just want to have fun with the game now. Since my rating was dropped from D’s database, it’s not like I’m worried about losing points. I tried to bring someone else’s decks to Vegas with me for the DPC, and that just didn’t turn out well at all. They were so bad that I even lost a game to Matt Lush, for crying out loud! j/k, Matt. ;-)<br>
<br>
I tested some fun decks with Chris Shaner, Brian Choonphol, Pat Hug, Jared Arthur, and Glenn (I don’t know your last name!) the night before to see what I was up against and to see what my decks can do - if anything. I built a fun WYS with Life Debt tech and a few out-of-the-ordinary cards just for fun and surprises, and now for something different! For DS, I’m building the DS2. Just for @#$%s and giggles. tee hee. Turns out it’s actually not a bad deck - the way I made it needs to be drastically altered, but the idea of building the DS2 ain’t all that bad. Anyway, I lose to Shaner and Pat, although I would have beat Shaner if I had read his cards - specifically Edcel Bar Gane. I dropped Han &amp; Chewie against Maul, Life Debt for 5 battle destinies, all +2. Instead, I only drew 1 because Bar Gane blows. I am constantly reminded why I quit playing this game competitively - it was the Senate.<br>
<br>
So instead, had I dropped Han &amp; Chewie at the Senate (Bar Gane &amp; Dodd alone), I would have gotten 4 battle destinies and easily won the game. Shaner saved himself 27 battle damage because I didn’t read his Senators. DOH!!! I added a Virtual Demotion to the deck just to take care of that little problem. I also tested against Brian. He was playing Blow Up The Death Star for Light vs. my DS2 for dark. He really wanted to destroy 2 Death Stars in a single game! Cool. Anyway, we went down to the wire. I was giving damage of 11 a turn, and he was draining for 9 a turn. He had 4 cards left, and I was down to 1. I showed him That Thing’s Operational and convinced him to save 2 Force for his destiny draws so he could blow up the DS2! He actually believes me and does so. Now he’s stuck - he can’t blow up the DS2 until he gets to the 3rd sector, and he doesn’t have 3 to satisfy Battle Order! And he has already verified that he was in his control phase! (A player can go back an action, but he can’t go back phases.) With 1 card left in my deck, I make him lose 6 direct damage and win. He’s still not talking to me anymore.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I make a few changes to each deck and go to have fun. Not to win, mind you... these decks don’t have the ability to do that. They’re just fun decks. My rating is something around 1600-1650... climbing back up! (kinda) Anyway, on to the games!<br>
<br>
GAME 1: LS vs. Chris Fanchi’s Retardosaurus Rex ISB<br>
<br>
Scot Vales is a friend of mine, and he has built a SW community in his little mountain town of Casa Grande. He gets about 10-15 people at his tournaments now - more than anyone else in AZ, I think! Anyway, one of his little padawans is paired against Brian Hunter. This is his first tournament, and he was only introduced to these cards a short time ago! We tell him that this guy is kinda good, so you might have a little trouble beating him. We also told him to have Hunter sign a card for him. When he asked which one, I promptly went through his small collection and found the perfect card.<br>
<br>
A Naboo card list. tee hee. Anyway...<br>
<br>
Well geez! Of all the long games in history, WYS vs. RR is going to take some time. We didn’t have any interaction for awhile - it was more plinking drains off of each other and running from battles (both of us). I flipped with Luke at Tatooine (he was cancelling drains with Outer Rim Scouts on Den of Thieves, so the drain of 3 vs. 1 didn’t matter), Theron at a DB, and a Palace Raider at another DB. I drop Celebration while I’m at it and move Theron Nett into the Cantina. He drops his ISB droid to make my drains -1, so he has to take the 1 for awhile as I slowly retrieve. I eventually get a hand, move Luke to Kessel, Dash to Tat, let Theron take off, and drop Han with the Raider in the Cantina. He is draining me a little in space, but it’s not too bad yet. Again, very little interaction. I decide that this isn’t a fun game yet.<br>
<br>
In order to make it so, I drop another Raider to the Tat DB in a craft and move Han’s raider away, leaving the best smuggler in the universe alone with his drinks. He drops on my "mistake" with Maul and someone vs. my Raiders, and Vader against Han. He battles with the Raiders. MAUL MISSES MY PALACE RAIDER!!! tee hee. He gets the second one, though. I draw surprisingly high and clear the site except for the droid. DOH!!! He clears off my Raiders, but I don’t take any damage. Then he initiates against Han. I play Life Debt from my hand.<br>
<br>
I HAVE THREE CARDS IN MY FORCE PILE. TWO OF THEM ARE CHEWIE.<br>
<br>
That sucks balls for me. I opt NOT to play Underestimate Our Chances at that point, as it would just be silly. I don’t know if you want to call that a game error or what, but it would have won me the game. 3 battle destinies, 5, 4, 6, all of them +2 (so it’s actually 7, 6, 8 for a total of 21 on top of 13 power) against his power 6 Vader without a draw - he would have lost 28 x 3 = 84 cards. But no. Chewie defied all odds to lose the game for me. CRAP!!!!!!!!!!! WORDS CANNOT EVEN DESCRIBE HOW MUCH THAT SUCKS FOR ME!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Fine. I lose Han and a couple (he was hit). Vader stays. If I was playing the old-skool Tat system, I wouldn’t have lost those 2, but whatever. The only other point of interest was my only actual play mistake. But boy, was it ever a mistake. We’re coming close to time, and we’ve both got around 25-30 Force left. I drop Chewie &amp; Phylo to his spaceport DB to stop his drain with Bliz 2 and 3 ORS. Well, Phylo must have bored Chewie to death because he decided to leave to the Used Pile. Silly me forgot upkeep. Then he decides to drop another ORS ("hello insult, meet injury!") and battles me hard. I draw a 4, but who cares. I lose a lot on this one.<br>
<br>
Luke is still draining for 2 at one of his systems. He drops Fett and adds Thrawn as a passenger. He Imp Commands me to add a destiny and searches his deck. There is a 6, 5, 5, 5, 2, and 1. Wouldn’t you know - he draws the 1 and 2, the ONLY combination in the entire deck that doesn’t knock out Luke’s immunity. I didn’t know my destiny at this point, so I darklighter spin for the 6 to kill that nasty admiral. At this point, Brian Hunter (watching the game) says that he’s losing faith in me and my tracking abilities! ;-) I’ll show him. tee hee.<br>
<br/>
I Edge a few times with a tracked 6, but it only delays the game even more. We battle in space again a few turns later. I draw that tracked 6 to crack his immunity and kill Fett, and his destiny isn’t enough to take out my Skywalker. I leave Dash in front of the Executor to block the drain of 2, and he starts his turn as time is called. He drains me a little, but I’ve still got several cards (about 10) in my deck. The only thing he can do is battle Dash. He beats me by a couple, but doesn’t crack my immunity. Dash stays. I drain him down as far as I can, then I battle the Executor. I don’t reduce his power, and I lose the damage from my deck before forfeiting anybody to give him the full win.<br/>

<br/>
THE GOOD: Timed games suck. If I have the choice, I will never time a game.<br/>
THE BAD: Chewie is the first upkeep character I’ve ever played, and I’m a scrub.<br/>
THE UGLY: CHEWIE!!!! You’re never around when I need you...<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Chris was fun. We could actually talk during the game and have a good time.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2: DS vs. Wyatt Everett’s Obi’s Hutt Mains &amp; Toys<br/>
<br/>
Not much happened in this game. I set up the DS2 abnormally quick and stayed in space until I found my Admiral Order - I saw several destiny adders fly during the direct damage. I hold Endor with a TIE &amp; cannons and a Virtual Imp-Class, and Naboo is fortified with Zuckuss, 2 TIEs, a cannon, and a REALLY BIG cannon, if you know what I mean. I finally find my Battle Deployment - he only gets 1 battle destiny on the ground, I deploy my walkers from the deck. Including Blizzard 4. ;-) I drain him for lots, I damage him for lots, he only drains me for 1 with Quiggy on Tatooine. He makes a late attempt to blow up the DS2, but there just isn’t enough time. It was too much damage too fast. I wish I could have had this good of a DS game later in the day!<br/>

<br/>
THE GOOD: Not much happened. I just wanted my DS to win a game today, and it did. Cool.<br/>
THE BAD: Um...<br/>
THE UGLY: Um...<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Wyatt isn’t the best player, but he does have fun with the game.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: DS vs. John Baril’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
Okay, because this works. I get another quick start, and TTO hits the table turn 2. I got to the Tat system instead of Naboo and hit him for a quick 3 and 4 damage. He has a hold of Kessel, so the damage is even. The system goes back and forth, but the deciding battle is with Mirax &amp; Talon vs. Bossk &amp; Fett at Tat. I get 3 destinies, he gets 2. Everything gets knocked out, but the Skate remains floating. I keep the system and the direct damage going all game now.<br/>
<br/>
The turning point in the game was with Vader, Jerjerod, and Igar in the Cantina against Wedge, Luke, and Han. He hits Vader, hits Jer, and I lose everything and 7. He only loses Wedge. I dropped Maul to Tat (the Tat version). Luke, Han, and Chewie were the LS characters on Tat. We ran around each other, and I kept Maul in front of Han and Chewie to block his drain and create one for myself. The direct damage is still hitting him, but he still has me at Kessel. He ends up draining me out first.<br/>
<br/>

2 (-20)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: It was close - that 7 damage really did good things for him<br/>
THE BAD: I should be using Choke Vader in this deck instead of Lord.<br/>
THE UGLY: I also should have moved the DS2 to Kessel instead of Tat to get rid of Dash.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: I’ve met John a few times now, and we’ve become friends. It was a fun game.<br/>
<br/>
So Enrique sees that I’m writing my notes on the back of my unused virtual card sheets and offers me actual paper. Cool! He’s also giving away uncut sheets for raffle prizes!!!<br/>
<br/>
... Well, actually they’re uncut sheets of VIRTUAL SETS. tee hee.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: LS vs. Scot Vales’s Hunt Down And Destroy Your Sanity<br/>
<br/>
He uses Fears and Limited Resources along with Your Eyes Can Deceive You and Defensive Fires and all kinds of crap. He loses Eyes from his hand to an early Visage because he knows it doesn’t bother me. My opening hand doesn’t have any characters in it, and I wouldn’t draw one until 2 turns later. I flash the Outrider to get Dash to Kessel, but he has Vergeance (the DS version - whatever it is) in his hand and hits me early with it. Drat. He plays Death Mark on the Endor DB - drat. I flip with a Raider &amp; Nett, land dash (he had moved to Tat a few turns ago, since both systems are drains of 1 now), and use db transit to get to endor. Dash goes to used pile, death mark goes away. I drew TT early, but I waited to use it until Vader hit the table. Usually a good idea - not against Scot. I should have known better.<br/>
<br/>
So I have no characters and no Admiral’s Orders. This really sucks. I finally get Han &amp; Chewie against Maul and play Life Debt from the lost pile, but he has the Ghhhk. I am such a desperate scrub that he hits me with Limited 4 times this game. I’ve played against this deck before - hell, I LEARNED how to play SW against this deck. And now it school’ed me again.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
THE GOOD: I got that first drain of 3 at Kessel.<br/>
THE BAD: Everything else all game long.<br/>
THE UGLY: This is about as bad as I can possibly play.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: I don’t want to put all the blame on my bad playing. Scot played this game very well, too. Actually, it was probably the best he has ever played against me. He played this game very well.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5: LS vs. Wyatt’s DS Mains &amp; Toys<br/>
<br/>
There isn’t much to tell, and I was so frustrated with the last game that I didn’t take good notes. Basically, I dropped down characters and he didn’t. That means I win. He got a total drain of 3 (at 2 sites), but I was retrieving more than that with Luke and celebration, so I let him have it. He initiated a few battles, but I reacted with Life Debt or Palace Raiders each time to make him lose lots until he decided maybe battling isn’t the way to go. He just stopped doing it. Tatooine was a pretty big place this game, so my Celebration kept my lost pile empty all game. I even found strange and unusual ways to put cards from the table into the pile just to retrieve them back and climb out of this hole I’ve dug myself into. YISYW &amp; Stage Areas went to find an effect - there aren’t any, I retrieve. I used all the lost interrupts I could come across (using Mirax) and retrieved them back. I even went into a few bad battles just to put characters into the lost pile before retrieving them back. It was just bad.<br/>
<br/>

4 (+11)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: I finally get a good game in.<br/>
THE BAD: Um...<br/>
THE UGLY: I don’t like to squash Wyatt like this, but I was feeling down about my previous games and wanted something positive again. I prolly shouldn’t have owned him this badly, but whatever.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: I don’t know how much fun it was for him, but we at least got a fun conversation out of it.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6: DS vs. Davie Jones’s Hyperdrive Generator deck<br/>
<br/>
Great, just what I wanted. I was looking forward to facing half of the Colorado crew today... I really was. ;-) Turn 1, he gets Obi, saber, obi’s journal, and proficiency down. Um, Okay. Whatever. I set up the DS2 in 2 turns for the third time today, but i can’t find my system, my sites, or any Neimodian Advisors for way too many turns. That means no damage, so it doesn’t matter how quickly I set up the DS2. DOH!!!<br/>
<br/>
He keeps tat. I finally get my stuff going, but I’m a bit behind. I drop a few guys and an at-at to naboo, but he drops Amidala and crew. Who plays the Naboo amidala and the naboo crew without playing Naboo sites? I wasn’t expecting this one. I’m losing characters with high forfeit, not force, so it’s not too bad yet. I get to keep my damage and drain of 2 going, but his watto drain of 4 (3 + stacking a card) hurt me right back.<br/>
<br/>
Lando can’t exclude Dr. E, and I lose Igar out of his Tempest 1. I stack a few more characters and refuse to battle back because he has 7 characters sitting there - he’s never going to lose them all. I may at least get the +1 damage from occupying the site instead of taking +1 damage to another drain. I move everything to the battle plains, and he follows. I drop Thrawn to an empty DB for an extra drain and an extra loss. It works for a turn before Padme goes back. I drain and damage, but he still has 6 cards left. The only thing I can do is battle Padme, draw high, and hope he draws abnormally low to lose Padme and 4 more cards. It doesn’t happen, so I lose.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 6<br/>
4 (+5)<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: I set up the DS2 in TWO TURNS!<br/>
THE BAD: It just DIDN’T MATTER!<br/>
THE UGLY: That beatdown crew of Amidala + her Naboo crew really hit me by surprise. She only gets her bonus on Naboo, so if you’re not playing Naboo sites, why bother with these characters? To beat me up, apparently.<br/>
PROPS TO OPPONENT: This was a fun game for both of us. That was the idea behind building my deck. It works.<br/>
<br/>
Davie offered me suggestions that I might actually take up. Build the DS2, have it orbit some planet without any sites, and just use TIEs from then on. While I’m not building a TIE deck anytime soon, I might just ditch my sites (maybe leave the DB) to focus more on space.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that’s that. Hunter and Shaner get in the final confrontation, Hunter wins his first game by 34, and the party’s over. Shaner’s QMC goes against Hunter’s Combat, and Shaner has to win by 35. He has the cool tech of playing the anti-combat shield and puts Arconas at Hunter’s sites. They can’t be immediately lost, and they can react away. Cool. Hunter can’t find any characters early in the game, so Shaner even gets a drain of 3 with an Arcona. Funny stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the game, Hunter cancels Shaner’s CC Celeb, but Shaner plays 2. Hunter can’t find the celebration and expects ME to know where it is! ;-) He also played his final turn wrong, in my humble opinion. He had 2 destinies in a space battle, and he had Choke Vader vs. EPP Leia. He only had 3 cards in his reserve deck, and everyone knew they were 4, 7, 7. Well, EVERYONE WHO READ THEIR ARTICLES knew he had a 4, 7, 7. He battled Leia, missed the choke, and drew 7. He battled somewhere else on the ground and drew the last 7. Instead, it might have been better if he battled in space, drawing the 4 &amp; 7. Then he could have gone against Leia and either choked her or drawn the 7 for destiny, whichever he wanted. Anyway, he’s 2300+ and at the winners table, while I’m just watching. So he must have some idea of what he’s doing.<br/>
<br/>
We all go out to dinner at Perkins across the street. The group includes the Tucson crew, myself, Choongie, Jared, and the Colorado crew. We have a long table in a room by ourselves, so we decided to take YET ANOTHER Last Supper picture because kiki is cool and brought his camera. I’m sure Hunter never gets tired of it. Right? RIGHT?!? Yeah. We talk tech, and then they start talking LotR tech. Those of us who don’t play just sit back, smile &amp; nod.<br/>
<br/>
Hunter is at the head of the table beside me, and I can hear some "strange" sounds coming from him. After about 12-13 times, I really have to turn to ask him "That’s the chair, right?" He assured me that he hasn’t been ripping all night - yes, it was indeed the chair.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was fun. I didn’t win many games, but I guess I expected that with the decks that I brought.<br/>
<br/>
PROPS:<br/>
* Kiki for running an amazing tournament with amazing prize support. EVERYONE walked away with a tournament foil (except top 3, I think). Top 4 walked away with glass. Top 2 got uncut R3 sheets. And packs on top of that. Very cool.<br/>
* Gamers Edge for hosting the event<br/>
* CO crew for coming down<br/>
* Kingman crew for coming down<br/>
* Everyone else who made the trip<br/>
* Little McCormack for being cool and going to Jack In The Box with me<br/>
* Choongie for only activating 2<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS:<br/>
* Hunter for ripping farts all night long. I know it was you! ;-) j/k<br/>
* Chewie for having an upkeep cost and not letting me know about it<br/>
* Characters for not being in my hand<br/>
* Jeff for being in Wyoming instead of flying with me the next day<br/>
* Myself for being such a scrub in every possible way. I only do ONE thing in this game well! (but boy, do I do it well...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading! Have some fun with this game. That’s the only way it’s going to last.<br/>
