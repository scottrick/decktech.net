<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Another scrubby local tourney at Millennium Games in Rochester NY. I ran this one and only 8 people showed up...But 5 of those 8 were 1700+ so whatever.<br>
<br>
PRE-TOURNEY WORTHLESSNESS<br>
<br>
I had been running on insomnia mode the week before, as I had boku finals to study for and papers to write. No sleep Monday night or Thursday and very little any other night so I was rather exhausted the night before the tourney and I dropped for a good 8 hours.<br>
<br>
Woke up with no alarm at like 7 and couldn’t get back to sleep cuz I was mad hungry. There’s like nothing in my room to eat either except a pint of Ben and Jerry’s Half-Baked ice cream. Lemme tell you a little something about Half-Baked .. it is THE best ice cream I have ever eaten. So I have no qualms about eating it for breakfast. I down that while organizing a playlist on my comp then decide I’m still not tired so I head to caissa.com for some chess. Here’s a little something for you chess fiends:<br>
<br>
Chess game<br>
My (1502) black against random.internet player (1514) white<br>
time control game in 10<br>
He starts off with the ol’ boring 1.e4 so I’m like "...c5" because the Sicilian is just good. He brings out the Nf3 next move and I push my king pawn one square. Then he pushes 3. d4 and I go ahead and snag that with xd4. So of course his knight loops around and picks off my pawn Nxd4 and I decide to have some balls and whip out the queen’s knight f6. He doesn’t take like most people do, choosing instead to develop his queen’s knight c3. So I go ahead and move my same knight to pick his off, forcing his queen to come down and complete the exchange. My king’s pawn then develops to e7 and he does something meaningless so I move the king’s knight again up to c6 to attack his queen.<br>
<br>
He moves the queen out of the way and begins to develop more pieces. He ends up castling queenside while i castle kingside. He starts mounting a monster attack on my kingside with a bishop, his queen, and possibly a rook. I see this coming and force him into a couple pawn exchanges and ultimately a queen exchange. This takes the pressure off of my king so i can focus some attention elsewhere ..<br>
<br>
I notice that my knight (who is protected by a pawn and is past being attacked by any pawns) is in such a position that he could fork my opponent’s king and rook, by checking the king and attacking the rook at the same time. The only catch is my opponent’s knight is covering the space i need to move my knight to for the fork. So i start pushing a couple pawns down the board to attack this knight. Eventually a pawn reaches an attacking position against the knight and my opponent moves it. So I fork the king/rook and swap my knight for the rook.<br>
<br>
That puts me up by a couple so as long as i dont screw up i should be ok. After that exchange it is his knight, rook, and two bishops against my two bishops and two rooks. I force him into another exchange wherein he gets my bishop for his knight but that’s fine with me. That makes it my two rooks and a bishop against his two bishops and a rook. Plus the pawns i pushed to attack the knight earlier had royally screwed up his queen-side pawn structure, so it was only a matter of time before my rooks took over and forced him into a resignation.<br>
Full win 0-1<br>
<br>
So it’s like quarter to nine and I figure I can still get some decent sleep but I just cant nod off .. whatever .. I take out my BHBM deck and change like 6 cards and download some stuff off Gnutella and before I know it it’s 11 o’clock. I shower and I’m off with my roommate Nick Bongio and the should-be CT state champion Mike Van Zander to the wonderful world of Millennium.<br>
<br>
ACTUAL GAME DETAIL BEGINS HERE<br>
as if it mattered<br>
<br>
Decks are Profit and BHBM and they both suck huge donkey balls but sometimes they win so I play them.<br>
<br>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
Profit against Nick (1545)’s walkers and junk on Hoth.<br/>
<br/>
Friggin tournament software paired us, that blows. He starts Hoth with IAO/Mob Points and Decree. First turn he drops the Dagobah Cave and like the Ex docking bay.<br/>
I put some guys in the Chamber so I can free Han and start the damage.<br/>
<br/>
He apparently can’t draw a site or something because next turn he pulls the Hoth Docking Bay and that’s the only site that sees play on Hoth all game. He puts a ship at Hoth and Igar on Tempest 1 along with some other walker jank at the Hoth dbay to render my saber force drain bonuses worthless. But I do a massive spreading-out job on Tatooine with DBay 94 and the &lt;&gt; DBay too. He comes over with EPP Vader and some blue crap but sabers and Smoke Screens and Lando drawing Jedi Luke for exclusion destiny against Vader cause him some pain for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
I never go to Hoth but then I really don’t need to because he can’t draw his sites so his drains are minimal. My drains and direct damage take him out after a while.<br/>
Full win by 20s.<br/>
<br/>
Happy: Lando excluding Vader, saucy.<br/>
<br/>
Sad: paired against my roommate, lame.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get called to make a ruling between Jason "Ears" Stewart and Tom Colarocco; Stewart had played a Surprise Assault against Tommy C’s lone Executor with 6 pilots on it, thinking he would get to draw 7 destinies. Ears is an 1800+ player and usually doesn’t make goofy mistakes but he really screwed this one up. Anyway what happened was Ears had paid the one force for SA and was about to draw destiny when Tommy reminded him that he only drew one. So Ears wanted to take it back and Tommy wouldn’t let him. So they called me over and I was like "hey, the action has been initiated but not resolved" cuz to me resolving would mean drawing destiny and comparing totals etc. And the Decipher rules I guess are that an action can be taken back as long as it hasn’t resolved. I dunno if I made the right call or not but I’d definitely make it again in a second because losing a game on one simple misplay just isn’t cool, especially at an 8-man local. Tommy ended up winning the game anyway and I’m sure he’s glad that he got it fair and square.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
BHBM against Andrew Galle (1504)’s randomness.<br/>
Well he starts Tatooine system with Menace Fades, Squassin, and the starship weapon forfeiting effect. HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
First turn Palpy hits the CC docking bay. Andrew draws and takes the drain. Mara joins Palpy and gets an all-important saber.<br/>
<br/>
He draws again and I Monnok him used, the get the drain again. He’s activating like 5 a turn to my 9 billion which is bad for him.<br/>
<br/>
He puts a Tatooine:Desert down and I’m like .. "house" so he shows me old school Wedgie to get old school Red 2. YES. They go to Tatooine along with an XWing Cannon.<br/>
<br/>
I drain and Monnok to make sure there is no Power Pivot in my future and drop Bossk and Zuckuss to take out Wedgie and stack a card. Oh yeah I had Lat Damage too so there was like 6 card overflow with me drawing two battle destiny and his being 0.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and puts Ben Ken with a stick at the Desert and I’m like whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I drain for four and throw Vader down with a stick to punk Ben for some damage and overflow. I’m thinking he’ll probably Sandwhirl my Vader but who cares because I can win this game without Vader.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn’t have enough force to deploy his only Luke (Rebel Scout) from lost pile so he draws and loses 3. I drain for 6 after that and well you can figure how the game went from there. Luke came out on like the next to last turn of the game but it of course made no difference.<br/>
<br/>
Full win by 30s<br/>
<br/>
Happy: Lat Damage, Bossk, and Zuckuss.<br/>
<br/>
Sad: Red 2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lunch is uneventful except there was this hot chick outside this dance studio or something dressed in those dance outfits or whatever they wear and she was looking pretty nice. So I like stared at her for like 5 minutes straight and she didnt even acknowledge me. I’m a loser baby so why don’t you kill me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOW THE TWO GOOD GAMES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
Profit against Zander (1832)’s wannabe Brian Hunter ISB<br/>
<br/>
The inevitable matchup. Me and Zander. He starts Arica in the Chamber, ok great. He draws his hand and tells me it sucks but he seems to set up pretty fast so I think he was bluffing. I get a crap hand for sure with one character ... TWASS KHAA. Isn’t that lovely.<br/>
<br/>
So his first turn Ozzel Ozbourne hits the Ex DBay for some force gen. I go and activate and look for a docking bay and of course .. 3 Bens, 3 Masters, 2 Leia, 2 Lando, yadda yadda. Now if you ask Zander about this he will tell you this is not the case but I am 100% SURE this is the way things went. I draw a few because there was a Sorry About the/Blaster Pro I needed.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and stuffs more guys in the Ex DBay, Piett comes down and pulls Merrejk who gets Fondor. Zippity-do-da.<br/>
<br/>
I go and look for a docking bay again and this time there’s like Lando and a Master I think so I draw again. BAH.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and activates some and Monnoks me. This is where he will tell you differently. He swears he Monnoked me second turn but I am positive it was third. Either way all he got was two Smoke Screens which I would later retrieve with my objective. He’s up to like 4 scrubs in the Ex DBay and he draws.<br/>
<br/>
I finally put some guys in the Chamber but don’t pull Han immediately. Luke has his Saber so I’m hoping to tell Arica "Sorry About the Mess" next turn.<br/>
<br/>
He goes and pays 10 for the Ex at Fondor and of course he’s been pulling systems, Endor and Kashyyyyyyyyyyk are out now too. Then he wants to move his guys from the Ex DBay to the Ex for free and I think it costs him one for each guy, hell I’m still not sure about it. We call Brett Kingery over to make the call for us and he’s like "yeah it’s one for each guy" so Zander’s like "I don’t want to do that then" so he takes back the Ex and ends up doing something else which I dont remember exactly .. puts more guys out I think.<br/>
<br/>
I rescue Han, retrieve everything, hit Mara with Luke’s stick, drain for 2 and do 1 Profit damage. So I’m off dealing damage first. I had like Lando too I think so I put him out at Tat:JP and move Han out there. And I have Run Luke Run in hand along with the infamous Fallen Portal so I’m thinkin I should be ok.<br/>
<br/>
Z goes and gets the Ex out this turn, then transits all his schmucks but Ozzel to the bridge. I figure he’s got a Ghhhhhhhk so there’s no point in dropping the Corran Horn in my hand to battle.<br/>
<br/>
I lose Your Insight to get Search and Destroy out of my deck and activate a bunch. So I’m about to drain but I notice the top card of his lost pile is EPP Vader and I’m like "Hmm... Out of Commission" so he’s got 6 cards and he shuffles them and fans em and is like "pick" and I’m like "nah, make a pile and cut, do it the official way" and he’s like "PICK" so I pick the 4th card and hells yeah it’s Vader. So I don’t need to worry about that guy for the rest of the game. I drop Search and Destroy and put I think Leia down with Anakin’s because I didn’t draw a friggin Ben till like the game was over basically. Even though I started the game with his Saber in my hand. He loses to S&amp;D and goes.<br/>
<br/>
He gets out Cheerio on the Ex and a fourth agent for the flip. I’m figuring he’s gonna put 5D6 down but he had not drawn him yet so I’m safe from that for another turn. I’m trying to find my second Sorry for when 5D6 does show.<br/>
<br/>
So it’s my turn after he loses to S&amp;D and I drain and do Profit damage. He has the Den out so one of my drains is being cancelled each turn. I OOC again and get an ORS, isn’t that convenient .. by now I’m spread across the Chamber, Tat:JP, and DB 94, with a saber at two of the sites. so I’m draining for 5 with 3 in damage, plus S&amp;D. I draw into my Sorry so I’m ready for 5D6 when he comes down.<br/>
<br/>
So eventually we each get set up and it looks like this: Z has a Destroyer at Fondor, Kashyyyk, and Endor, and Cheerio up there too so I’m getting hit with 8 a turn. I finally get Ben/saber out and have sabers at three sites plus I have spread to his Endor docking bay so I am dealing 4 damage a turn with Profit. S&amp;D is kicking in but he is dropping suicide ORSs with Ghhhks to cover that and impose ISB’s drain restrictions for a turn. It comes down to a drain race and thanks to me getting set up faster (and in part to me OOC’ing Vader) I come out on top by 7 big ones.<br/>
<br/>
Happy: the lucky OOC’s<br/>
<br/>
Sad: taking ratings points from zander<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So at this point I go over to enter the results in the computer and some kid is playin Diablo on it. I’m like hey, lemme get on here real quick and enter these scores - cuz usually guys are cool about this, I take two seconds to enter scores and that’s that. They go about their gaming. Well it turns out that this A$SHOLE had CLOSED the @#$%ing tournament software. Just closed it. Like the PRICK he is. So I’m ready to punch this mother@#$%er in the face but I figure if I do I’ll probably bust the pimples on his face and get that @#$% all over me so I refrain. I go back to the other guys and I’m like hey, everybody remember how their first three games went? And everyone did. So I whip out the command cards and do it that way. PAIN in the ass.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
BHBM against Tommy C’s (1876) Hologameboard start and Surprise Assaults<br/>
He starts that and Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Strike Planning.<br/>
<br/>
First turn Palpy is on Cloud City and I draw one. He puts Crix on the Home One docking bay and puts a Projection of a Skywalker on table. I have CHYBC though so I fear not the Hologameboard. And I also have Mara Jade so I drop her on Crix, pull her saber, swing and hit and draw a 3 for BD so it’s crix and 6 (and one to Insignificant). Mara would sit and drain uncontested for most of the game.<br/>
<br/>
He spends the next two turns recuperating and drawing while I drain and get set up with some combos in my hand. Eventually he puts Jedi Luke with Anakin’s and a Proficiency down to the Home One DBay, I Barrier. Next turn I track some destiny and hit Luke with Sniper/Strike and drain for two. Even though Luke can come back from lost I figure it was worth it because I got rid of the Proficiency and the saber and got a drain in.<br/>
<br/>
Luke does come back, this time to his Endor dockbay with another saber. I drop IG w/Gun, Fett w/Blaster, and Xizor down there to square off with Lukie, but my destinies suck and his are freakin good (he hits Xizor and draws a 6 in BD) so I have to toss everyone from the site. Fortunately though I won and drew enough attrition to take Luke out with one overflow and one to Insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
He puts two Eloms on the Endor docking bay, and I have premiere Vader, a saber, and a Sniper/Dark Strike in hand so I figure I’ll drop down and pay them a visit. First I use Sim Aloo to check his top destiny so he can’t Fallen Portal .. it’s a friggin 6 so I move it. Now I dont know what the top card is but I’ll take my chances. I drop Vader and the stick and initiate, he Portals .. and draws a 5. BAH.<br/>
<br/>
So Vader bites it and the Eloms get a drain. Tommy puts some more Eloms down along with Jedi Luke from lost and Chewie of K and transits them in front of Mara at the Home One.<br/>
<br/>
I’m like, sure, I drop Choke Vader with another saber, capture Luke, choke Chewie, hit the Eloms, thanks for playing. Plus I had put Zuckuss and 4LOM at Carida like 3 turns earlier so between that drain and Palpatine’s the game was over pretty quick. I did lose a card every turn to my objective like an Honest Jim for the rest of the game while I drained him out.<br/>
FW by 20<br/>
<br/>
Happy: was a good game, i actually enjoyed it<br/>
<br/>
Sad: Portal Vader<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WRAP-UP<br/>
Hey I ran the tourney so I have the final standings. Here you go, for what it’s worth:<br/>
<br/>
Reid Smith 8 (85)<br/>
Jason Stewart 6 (53)<br/>
Brett Kingery 4 (16)<br/>
Mike Van Zander 4 (3)<br/>
Tom Colarocco 4 (-3)<br/>
Andrew Galle 4 (-41)<br/>
Nick Bongio 2 (-61)<br/>
Tim Johnson 0 (-72)<br/>

Prizes are like Reflections 2, and I give Ears a YAB foil. One of my R2 packs had a Jap Chewbacca, so that was the pull of the day for me.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards Zander and I go trade the store some random R2 SRFs for one of each Jedi Knights starter .. we’ll probly play a game eventually. If you haven’t yet bought any JK, lemme give you a little tip .. don’t. It’s weak.<br/>
<br/>
I play three games of Shadowfist against this dude and beat him all three times. I won’t go into the details but they were really good games and I learned a lot from them. If you’re looking to get into a new game, I highly recommend Shadowfist.<br/>
<br/>
PRRRROPS<br/>
Tommy C for a great game<br/>
Brett K for coming out and placing third with NO Reflections 2 in his decks<br/>
Dibella’s for the Godfather<br/>
the Sicilian for being a boss opening<br/>
