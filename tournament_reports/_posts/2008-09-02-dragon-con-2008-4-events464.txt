<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Here is my 08 Dragon Con report!  You can check out last years report by going to my main page and finding it if you'd like. <br>
<br>
I was the main TD for our events at DCon this year.  Quite different than last year when DCon was my 2nd tournament since quitting after endor (and only playing maybe 5 local tournaments before then).<br>
<br>
Here is the schedule:<br>
Sat <br>
11-5 Dagobah Regionals (I direct and do not play)<br>
7-12 Sealed deck action (actually it couldnt have lasted 5 hours, but maybe we started late?)<br>
<br>
Sun<br>
11-5 Mini-Open Worlds Qualifier (3 TD system so I can play!)<br>
7-11 Cube draft (run by myself and kevin reitzel)<br>
<br>
There was tons of good prize support.  Basically here is a rundown of what I received, and this isn't including some of the best stuff from the regional of course: obi jk, srf combo, jedi luke foil (actually this was mine to begin with as you will read), epp han, uhh tournament foils/ep1 AIs/ref 2&amp;3 foils (course I did not get all that stuff, but I dont remember exactly what I got so thats an idea).  We also had about 6 oversized cards, a gen veers t-shirt, and many many posters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright so let me explain some of the week before the event.<br>
<br>
The week is super stressful for my job.<br>
I think I had like a panic or stress attack or something friday, although it didnt seem like it?  I dunno I am still really confused about it.<br/>
Tues + Wed nights I had some guys over for swccg, which was fun.  At the same time though, my wife got kind of upset wednesday because I forgot to tell her about it (whoops!).  Wed, Thurs, + Fri, I spend many many hours building/finishing the cube and a couples decks for others that will be at the tournament.  <br/>
<br/>
So that leads us up to the events!  Since I won GA States and didn't need to compete for the worlds bye, I volunteered to run Dagobah Regionals at Dragon Con and also some other events.  It was a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning Nick, Jeremy and I carpooled down to the convention and got our badges.  There was a bit of a mixup as I was not told I'd be getting a free badge, but I was able to sell my free one as I had bought another for $50 so that was good.<br/>
<br/>
So by 11:30 (late as always), the regionals is underway, and I am really looking for one of the top GA players to take it.    We have only 7 at the event (2 from out of town).  5 other GA players could not make it (most were busy @ the con doing normal con stuff).  But the best players from the area were there: nick and jeremy.  Also, defending champ Travis (I dunno his name but I imagine its Pastrana for some reason) from FL is there, bringing the heat as always.  So it another very cool FL player, Joe (Rev Joe on the boards here).<br/>
<br/>
Going into the event, I knew Jeremy was playing Watto and Profit, and I knew Nick was going to take mwyhl asteroids.  Nick sometimes doesn't like to take the most standard decktypes, which I think hurt him this tournament.  He can play anything really well though.  Jeremy is a newer player in atlanta and has really picked up on the game quickly, oftentimes playing the standard stuff (like profit), but also coming up with his own decks too.<br/>
<br/>
In the first round, Jeremy played Nick, Watto vs Asteroids.  I knew that was bad news for asteroids.  Watto does just too much damage quickly.  From what I heard though (I didn't watch), nick held out a long time, but a couple bad destiny draws ruined his hopes of being able to win.<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember much of what happened in all the rounds, as I was talking [i]constantly[/i] with people who used to play the game and possibly were interested in playing some for fun!  Some of these people showed up for our sealed (sat night) and our draft (sun night).  It was great being able to talk to probably around 20 different people about the game and get the word out that it was still around.  I also got contact info of 3 guys who live in town here who are interested in picking it back up!  Thats awesome :)<br/>
<br/>
So basically this is how the regionals went.  Nick did fairly well, and had a chance to come back after his early loss, but couldn't pull it out.  A newly returning player, Mark from IL, was basically tied for first with the other 2 top guys, Travis Pastrana and Jeremy.  Each player had taken at least one loss.  Mark actually seemed to get upset some when he lost, but he did really well for not having played in so long.  In one battle, he got 108 power to win the game!  Craziness.  Travis + Jeremy played at least once in the regular tournament, with Travis's Profit beating Jeremy's Watto by maybe around 15?  I am unsure exactly.  Before the final round, there was basically no way it wouldn't be those 2 guys in the final confrontation.  And sure enough, in the end Jeremy sneaked by Travis to get into 1st place.  Travis was 2nd, and the duel was on.<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy vs. Travis<br/>
While this confrontation began, I was starting up our sealed deck action, and thus did not get to watch the games much.  Jeremy chose to play light side first, his Profit against Travis' scrub ralltiir ops.  Travis' scrub rallops is very good, and has some great profit counters.  I am not sure how the game went, but I know he was using (for example) Admiral Ozzel (v) to nullify don't forget the droids v (note that this would not work on the pre-errata version).  After it was over, I heard that Jeremy won by ONE.  Good win, but in my mind, I thought that was the end.  There is no way watto can beat profit right?  Well, jeremy switched it up somehow, and pulled out a win with his watto.  I have no clue what exactly he did as like I said I was doing the sealed deck by this point, but he has experience with both decks and so he must have made it work.  Congrats Jeremy the new Dagobah Regionals Champ!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sealed Deck, Sat night:<br/>
So for this sealed deck we had a mix of EPP, EJP, and the premium packets from I think the OTSD, with gold squad y-wings and the such.  So I was dark side.  We had 6 people.  I got some decent cards, but did not draw them very easily.  Also since we had about 120 cards to build a deck from, we built 60 card decks.  Here was mine, or something similar:<br/>
<br/>
corulag x2<br/>
cantina<br/>
tatooine tusken canyon (1/1, drain +1)<br/>
jp: audience chamber<br/>
jp: dungeon<br/>

imperial pilot<br/>
denger ejp<br/>
JQUILLE (very nice rare pull #1!)<br/>
chevin<br/>
boba epp<br/>
salacius crumb<br/>
skrilling<br/>
aqualish x2<br/>
chall bekan x2<br/>
quarren<br/>
amanin x2<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
imperial barrier x2<br/>
trinto duaba<br/>
sense x2<br/>
dark maneuvers<br/>
tallon roll<br/>
hidden weapons (watch out!)<br/>
omni box<br/>
twilek advisor x2 (1 is starting)<br/>
tarkins orders x2<br/>
torture (destiny 6)<br/>
overload x2 (boom)<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE playing your eyes can deceive you, especially to start the game. Its great fun!<br/>
<br/>
We used the Cube rule where you can deploy a battleground once per game, so I started the D* site and pulled the AC to pull Jabba every game.  This gave me extra force gen from jabba's text.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the deck could just do whatever I wanted, going to space or ground.  I could play stuff like boba or jodo + hidden weapons, jquille (or anyone with decent power) + vibro ax to exclude one or two characters, etc etc etc.  I didn't bother with any kind of reacting skiff jank like some people, cause pulling the AC at the start was so good I needed to be able to protect it.<br/>
<br/>
3 games, vs the 3 light players.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
This game had LOTS of fighting on the ground, while I held my opponents (sorry forgot your name) tatooine for a steady drain of 2, plus extra power in battle at related sites.  That basically sealed the game, along with chall bekan + vibro ax and my masterful use of the non-hitting, forfeit -2 mos eisley blasters to make him lose his good characters instead of the bad high forfeit ones.  I didn't draw up any of my best characters this game (only jabba with the AC).  FW<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
Again I forget who I played.  And pretty much everything that happened.  I remember that I didn't play Jabba for some reason with the AC, and that I got dengar instead to shoot people because there was somebody I couldn't kill otherwise or something.  I dunno.  Wait maybe I drew Jabba early...  Anyways, I basically kept a forcedrain + battled where we were battling, while he was only able to backup where we were battling and not drain also (at least, I think thats how I remember it).  Again, I didn't draw any of my good characters, only EJP dengar with the AC.  FW<br/>
<br/>
game 3: vs Nick<br/>
This game was a lot of fun for me, as things definitely went my way.  I was able to convert his corulag early, and get jabba working well at the AC.  I think I was either draining at corulag or tatooine too.  I'm thinking corulag.  Anyway, nick was dying fast cause I had a big activation advantage.  So he dropped talz + epp luke to his own death star docking bay and moved them to my starting site (1/0 death star site where he drains +1).  So my turn I play Jodo + Boba + a bunch of scrub aliens, start a battle, hidden weapons luke, draw a 2 destiny (captured), and beatdown talz for 15.  gg.  That was fun :)  FW and a win in the event.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards Nick and I played another game.  Well this time instead of me converting his corulag, he converts my Audience Chamber before I'm able to pull Jabba with it!  Basically that was GG after drawing for 3 turns without pulling a location :P  I still got a beatdown for 12 in with jquille + vibro ax excluding both bo'marr monk + kalt revolutionary out of a battle, leaving a lone elom JQuille + EPP vader.  I still lost though, cause I had nothing else and he had done too much damage.  I would like to know what would have happened if neither of us had been force choked in our games and it had been an all out brawl!<br/>
<br/>
So at this point, its like midnight or something, and Nick, Graham, and I carpool home.  I got home @ 1:30 or so and had to stay up until past 3 getting stuff ready for the next day.  We met a swccg collector from Germany named Marcus who was looking for some cards and I got some for him.  He was real cool cause he dressed up exactly like Dash Rendar from our ccg card!  And the costume was really perfect looking along with his physical build and all. <br/>
<br/>
SUNDAY<br/>
<br/>
So the night before I'd decided to play TIGIH.  Normally I decide on decks weeks in advance, but I really didn't care too much for this tournament, so I thought I'd just go with it.  I thought it would be cool to try to repeat a win in the 08 Dragon Con mini-open (remember I won the 07 one, although regionals wasn't there in 07) with the same decks.  I played TIGIH and Bespin Clouds last year.  Well I really didn't want to test my bespin clouds, partially because its just a subpar decktype and partially because Nick hadn't done so well with it the day before.  I was sure I could win 2 games with it, but I thought I'd just go with a deck I already had built since I didn't want to be up all night building 2 decks (half the night for one deck was enough).  So I went with mistryl.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I started playing TIGIH in the SWCCG womb early last year when Reid Smith won some event with it and have played it on and off ever since.  Actually, more off than on, as its just something fun I fall back on when I don't expect HD or BHBM.  And it is a beastly deck when played correctly!  I never got to play the new A Jedi's Patience V, but thats more for the matchups I didn't expect anyways (bhbm &amp; hd).  The Jedi Survivor worked really well in my matchups.  Anyways, onto the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: TIGIH vs Graham's Mistryl (or is it spelled Mystril?? I have no clue)<br/>
The Mistryl matchup was one I was actually worried about because I haven't really played TIGIH since v15 came out.  Furthermore, I know that normal AOBS can give it a hard time.  Also, winning battles to stack cards on I Feel the Conflict could be hard vs the cheap power +2 aliens.  So this game began with Graham backing up shada and playing PotF on the Imperial City to make it a battleground.  He also got out the coruscant dbay but didn't put anyone there early on.  My first turn I just played a twix, moved Luke to the endor docking bay, and drew some.  Also I was activating a LOT early on this game.  I forget the exact turn of events, but he brought some more guys down to Coruscant so that he had (I believe) Shada, Guri V, Rystall, and one or two other beastly females at the imp city.  So I played Mace with Saber, Lando scoundrel, and Nabrun'd luke into battle.  I did some hefty damage and only had to lose lando.  He countered with Arica V, capturing Luke, and battling my lone Mace.  I had to forfeit mace, but I don't think I had to lose anything else and I had an AJR + another saber V in my hand.  So Mace came back out along with a second Lando Scoundrel.  Also sometime very early I got out Leia RP and Padme V and I had seeking an audience v out in case either of them were ever lost.  We had some more battles when Leia RP wasn't reducing his ability to 0 or at a different site canceling his force drain, and I would simply concentrate on hitting the droids and Mara/Arica when she was holding Luke.  Also I took Shada off for a while.  This ended up being a fairly easy game for me, as my deck's power characters just came out too fast.  FW +19, 2(19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Mistryl vs Joe's WYS<br/>
Joe (Rev_Joe on these boards) has a very interesting WYS.  It uses both merc Armor v + That's One V to make all his battle destinies +2.  its fairly sick to tell you the truth!  That plus the fact that he was drawing 2 or 3 battle destinies each battle made it hard to follow my gameplan of taking over the Cantina with a Dark Recon there to protect the drain from it being canceled.  I did a lot of quick damage though, getting Shada to a Coruscant dbay with guri v and backup first turn.  After that, he had Capt Han + Falcon V alone at some system (corellia v maybe?), and I came down on it with epp 4lom + zimh.  So 3 battle destinies should be able to take out immunity &lt; 4 right??  If you said yes, you are wrong!  I drew 3 1s for destiny.  That sucked!  So the Falcon survived and I chose to lose 4lom.  I kept zimh alive in space the rest of the game though to satisfy battle plan.  If I'd killed the falcon, he might not have been able to set up that whole battle destiny +2 thing, which would have been great.  Also early on I got out Corulag, so zimh hung out there when he wasn't threatening to drain at Tatooine.  The rest of the game pretty much centered around a fight for the Cantina, which he ended up winning.  But at the same time he won that battle, I was doing more damage than him elsewhere, and in the end was able to spread out to a 2nd coruscant dbay, the tatooine dbay, and the podrace arena.  This sealed the game for me.  FW +19 (again!), 4(38)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Mistryl vs Nick's QMC<br/>
Surprise surprise, QMC!  I've only played against QMC a handful of times, so I wasn't exactly sure how to win.  I set up a beefy little squad at a Coruscant docking bay, as I didn't know if he had an EPP or anything that could come take me out.  At the same time, he set up Outrider + Dash and 2 scrubs at different CC sites.  He didn't even move the scrubs together either, which really threw me off and I was reading all his cards trying to figure out how he'd absorb the battle damage.  Well there was nothing that mentioned anything like that, so he had to have something in his hand.  I came down and attacked one of the scrubs (kebyc v I think) with epp 4lom and ig-88 cause I didn't have any mistryl at all in my hand, and he moved him away with Dodge or path or something.  He was basically playing a lot of evasion cards + mass retrieval from celebration + uh-oh v.  Well I wasn't going for that I'll tell you that much!  Soon after, he had 3 different CC sites out, with scrubs alone at 2 of them, and kebyc + lobot v in the middle.  So I played denger in punishing one alone to the system (only had dash + outrider there), mara in front of one of the lone guys, and I think I still had my 2 bounty hunter droids in front of the last lone guy.  Then I played First Strike so he couldn't afford his evasion interrupts.  Dengar in Punishing One made Dash be lost (no immunity so no moving to attack position), and I got some decent action on the other ones.  Soon after he got HCF + Han's Toolkit V to bespin (before I could cancel celebration), so that sucked and I wasn't able to take it out all game, as later he reinforced by playing boshek v on the outrider.  It didn't matter much though, I didn't need to clear the toolkit at this point to win.  I simply just kept draining on coruscant and battling on cloud city until he ran out of cards.  First Strike was the game winner by far.  FW +20, 6 (58)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: TIGIH vs Nick's fun SYCFA flip deck<br/>
This game was brutal.  I went real easy on Nick cause he was playing a fun deck and was getting sick.  I did draw a perfect hand though, with threepio whps, leia rp, padme v, jedi survivor v, il-19 v, and seeking an audience v.  Actually maybe there was no 3p0, but really it didn't matter.  Jedi Survivor v + IL-19 v making his death star sites battlegrounds was huge.  Furthermore I got padme v damage going quickly and he couldn't ever get rid of it (although he did play imp decree v to reduce it).  I held off on going to space for a while as I knew he was playing 20 star destroyers (he told me so).  Late game HCF came and cleared him off of his drain 2 space spot, and that was it. FW +34, 8 (92)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Mistryl vs Graham's HB Mains<br/>
At the start I set up like normal at a coruscant docking bay, while he setup in space.  I couldn't find any space for some time which was weird.  Soon enough he deployed the Audience Chamber and Mace with stick there.  Well Mace was not enough to hold off the lady beat squad.  I don't remember what I came down with, but I know it included mara + stick (had some luck there pulling both from my reserve in the same turn with a stunning leader v) who hit mace during the battle.  Graham had to lose 12 cards, and that was pretty much game since I had that AC drain after that.  Also I used First Strike during that battle to retrieve Scum and Villainy, but never needed to play it afterwards.  Dark Recon first turn on Rendezvous Point, threatening a drain of 2 there for kicks, was definitely funny!  FW +23, 8(a lot)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: TIGIH vs Joe's Court deck<br/>
So Joe's light deck was his serious one!  This was a brutal game.  I knew I had first place (by far), so I decided to play for fun and put off force draining/retrieving with luke rs v for a couple turns so that I could setup i can't believe he's gone v.  Then after that I won basically every battle.  Mace + ICBHG v + smoke screen is huge.  ICBHG v is MASSIVE in space.  Absolutely huge.  Its impossible to lose battles in space if you get it setup in this deck, unless facing something like a ICSD v beatdown deck or something.  So basically I setup at my endor docking bay, with nabrun in hand and mace + stick, and also tantive v + hcf + lando scoundrel at his nal hutta.  He brought the fight to nall hutta but I quickly took him out there (in 2 turns I think), about which time I nabruned my guys into the AC and went to work in there.  I can't remember exactly what happened there, but I know I won.  Tantive IV v is still really good!  FW +27<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after their games ended, even before prize support, nick and graham left to get food.  well I guess graham didn't realize he was going to get 2nd place (neither did I to tell him at the time), so we ended up not doing a final confrontation since he was gone.  It didn't matter much anyways, since I beat him twice during the tournament and he was already getting the worlds bye anyways (I already had one).  So that was a fun event!  Obviously, most of the guys played their better decks Saturday, when I was TDing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Onto the.... CUBE DRAFT!<br/>
So for the draft we were expecting between 10 and 20 people, but possibly could have gone over since we'd talked to so many people through the Con who seemed interested in playing.  Well 12 people showed up, but 2 of them were too late (actually after the first game started), so we had 10.  About half of whom had not played in years!  Also a couple locals who just learned to play about 2 months ago were there, which was great.  Since we had 2 cubes, we were each able to draft both light and dark!<br/>
<br/>
Drafting....<br/>
Dark side first:<br/>
So early on, I didn't see anything that good handed to me until like the 5th pick of the 1st pack.  So my early picks were solid effects/interrupts.  I remember getting IAO, Image of the Dark Lord V, and I think a starting interrupt early on.  So when I was passed Imperial Domination V at about the 5th pack I was very happy!  I took it right away, and only drafted imperials from then on.  The problem was, I simply couldn't get my hands on many imperials at all.  I was forced to try to get a lot of combat vehicles + ships instead.  I ended up with baron + saber 1, katana v, sim aloo v (my only ability 4 character), 3 imperial walkers (or maybe 2), 1 icsd, and some TIEs.  I got a TON of good red cards though.  Like it was insane how many good red cards I had!  I also got Dagobah Cave to start, and a Sullust for a drain.  In the end, I only had NINE imperials, and I hadn't drafted any other characters at all!  Thats a problem in the cube btw if you've never played it.  So I had to hope that the strength of imperial domination + the enclosed vehicles/ships would keep my characters alive long enough for my superior effects/interrupts and some skill to win me the games.<br/>
<br/>
Light side:<br/>
I wasn't seeing much good for light side, and I hardly ever saw ships at all!  I only got a falcon and 2 or 3 corvettes.  Come to find out, the guy next to me drafted like 15+ ships, go figure!  But I was able to get enough characters this time, mostly 2/2 rebel pilots, and insurrection + mindful of the future.  I also got decent red cards, including draw their fire and... REVOLUTION, which probably shouldn't be in kevin's cube (the one I drafted from out of our 2), but I never played it either out of principle.  My best character was lando with blaster rifle.  Yeah I got screwed in that department too.  But I thought I had a decent deck, if only I could keep pilots in my few ships and get lucky drawing the ships in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Onto the games:<br/>
Game 1: imperial domination v dark vs someone's light side<br/>
Okay so all my opponents hadn't played in YEARS, so they all timed out the games!  This guy, I think his name was Chris, was cool (all of em were btw) though.  I went down early with a walker + some imperials to a desert and then to space with an imp class + 2 ties I think.  Enough to get a battle destiny thats for sure, and +3 to my power in battles at tatooine sites.  And so I was threatening to drain for 4.  He had to go somewhere, and he hadn't drawn enough space to take me on there, so he went in front of my walkers.  imperial domination basically dominated this game, since I did draw into my characters.  Also I had a presence of the force on the desert btw.  I can't remember how it exactly went, but we battled back and forth on the ground while I drained for 2 in space each turn.  The game was really short in how many turns there was since he took such a long time early on deciding what to do.  It was still fun though, and I made it a point not to rush any of my opponents since they were all just there for fun memories and not to win.  TW +something<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: light vs Daniel's ("Indiana Dan") dark side<br/>
This game was a lot of fun.  Daniel was dressed up as Indiana Jones, which was cool.  He had a beastly deck too, better than mine for sure.  Basically he had tons of good aliens and was fighting off my poor rebels from the tatooine desert we fought at.  Then in space I think I had the advantage and drained for 1 or 2 up there, while he drained for 1 at a different tatooine site.  It was a tough fight though, cause whenever I got something good out to fight with, he'd get out a counter to it.  For example, I played rebel snowspeeders, and he played dengar with gun (shoots vehicles).  I also had rogue something + hobbie though who added 2 to maneuver, so he couldn't hit that one.  Then I got out Lando with Gun, but he dropped greedo v, canceling his gametext!  There were a couple other examples like this, and it was somewhat frusterating, because he had obviously simply drafted better cards, or at least better for our situation.  It was still fun and close though.  As they all did, he played really slow and we timed out.  This was the game that I probably would have lost if he'd played quicker, so I told him afterwards that he would do better if he played faster.  Anyways, I ended up with more in my life force, even though I was doing worse on the game table, so I got another timed win.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: light vs Derek Brooks' dark side<br/>
Derek used to big a squadron member, running tons of events, and still plays frequently with a group of guys in Maryland.  They use made up cards though along with the v-cards, like general grevious and the such.  He was telling me about some of the crazy stuff they had, and it sounded totally insane.  Like battle droid watto that played droids from the lost pile and other crazy stuff!  Anyways, I started Corulag (wasn't able to draft a 2/0 site with light) and he started mos eisley.  Thats good for me, as its a drain 2 spot.  He pulled Tatooine with his free pull, and I pulled a CC 2/1 drain -1 place for mine.  So I was looking good.  But instead of deploying to drain at his 2/1 site, I decided to play my CC 2/2 exterior site from my hand since I had lando who adds a destiny there.  Upon closer inspection though, before deploying lando, I had a SICK combo that I didn't eve know was in my deck.  H'nemthe (adds 2 to deploy of male imperials at same and adjacent sites) + corporal kensaric (+2 to deploy of opponent's anything at same site if with another scout) + ralltiir freighter captain (a scout), all went to the 2/2 cloud city site with rogue 4.  So his male imperials would cost plus FOUR force at that site.  Then I was holding lando + melas in my hand.  And I had boshek v too.  So he thought for a looooooong time about what to do (yes we ended up timing out), and played some guys to my 2/1 drain -1 site.  I kept draining and built up some force + hand size.  He deployed more guys then moved them in front of my 2/2.  He had both Tarkin V (adds a battle destiny with a rebel at a mobile site) and a merc pilot on a transport vehicle (+1 more destiny).  I had Murr Danod (subtracts 2 from opponents total battle destiny) + lando scoundrel (adds a destiny), so we were fairly even, except his card still costed a bunch to deploy and I could shoot guys with lando.  So basically he drew some decent destinies and eventually cleared the Kensaric combo, but I cleared him off the site.  During this fighting, we both played First Strike/Draw Their Fire, and he was taking better advantage of it early on.  So quickly I stopped putting anyone at a place where they could be attacked except the 2/2 site he didn't want to go to anymore, and he dropped ability 4+ at the tatooine system, mos eisley, and a cloud city site.  Then he played we're in attack position now, and sure enough, he had a commander at mos eisley so he would do AO damage to me!  craziness!  But it didn't matter, because retrieve 2/lose 2 at the initiation of a battle was even better than that.  And I had Insurrection to help me soak up battle damage.  So I just dropped a lone scrub at each site and a lone corvette (my only space) at his tatooine and started 3 battles.  Retrieve 3, you lose 3, I forfeit everything and don't take overflow.  I did stuff like that for a couple turns until the game ended, and I got a 3rd timed win.<br/>

Game 4: dark vs Indiana Dan's light side<br/>
Indiana Dan also had a really good light side.  He started Rendezvous Point + Battle Plan while I played Dagobah Cave + Imperial Domination V.  He could have countered domination by putting a lone guy at rendezvous point and leaving him there, but he never did figure it out I guess.  Actually that didn't come into play at all, because I only drew like 2 imperials all game!  Or maybe 3.  So anyways, I stuck to my plan of only playing 2/1 drain -1 spots, while he did not.  I also drew a POTF and so I setup a big squad in space (Katana + ICSD + 2 ties + a pilot or 2) at a system where I could drain for 2 with presence of the force, then planned on moving my icsd + a pilot over to a 2/1 system where I drained for 2 at later on when I knew I was safe.  Like I said I wasn't drawing any characters, and it really made me play cautiously.  Also I was paying to drain, while he wasn't draining until he set up on ground, and the tatooine 2/1 desert with a BUNCH of characters.  So I knew I'd have to challenge him at the desert even though there's no way I could win, so I tracked a 6 destiny around to simulate Sim Aloo getting backup.  Also he had Jar Jar Binks there, who could put sim in the lost pile (along with himself), leaving a lone imp walker there, but I was using sim's gametext to make sure that couldn't happen.  Okay, funny story: In one of his first turns, Dan asks me, "someone said I could get this card on top of my lost pile" and shows me a bith shuffle from his hand.  I told him, "well its called tracking and it works like this."  So what does this "noob" who hasn't played in years go and do but start tracking around this destiny 5 to use against me at the desert!!!  So instead of just having to lose my imperial walker (forfeit 4) and being able to reinforce janus the next turn, he draws a freaking tracked 5 and I've got to lose them both!!  It was really insane.  And yeah I could have lost just janus, but I didn't have any way to get ability 4 back onto the site if I'd done that, so I didn't.  Anyways, I did draw my Image of the Dark Lord V though, so he was only draining for 1 after that, and I was paying 6 to drain for 4, so I still won.  This was really an insane game though :)  This guy Indiana Dan came in 2nd to last out of 10 players, but imo he was one of the best there.  Too bad he had to run into me twice instead of being able to beat on the other scrubs there :P   4th TW<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I got 4 timed wins and came in 2nd.  nick won all his games, although I dunno how many were timed and how many were full, so he won the event!  <br/>
<br/>
After the draft, it was midnight, and we cleaned up and left.  It was a ton of fun.  Oh we also gave out lots of prize support of course.  Yeah so like I said, it was a ton of fun for all.  I am still really excited about it, because we met 3 people in the atlanta area who are interested in picking the game back up and playing again!!  That is awesome :)<br/>

If you read all this way, you should get a prize or something.  Too bad, all you get is a "thanks for reading folks!" <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
