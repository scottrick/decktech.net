<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well about a week ago myself and cedirc simon local playtesting. We made it special rules type classic with no v cards no inserts no wys and no shields. People i know where really tired of playing the same old same old. We played a ton of match ups at my house for a bit. I decide on my deck for DS which is SYCFA Manip. Brangus. Yes the brokeness is back. Fof LS i as was still out. I always like hayes hunter and clints decks for ls since if you always looked at their TRM they would play skywalkers or something stupid like that just becuase.  So about half through the week I decide to play trm hayes hunter style and add 2 falcons as well as super home one for space. <br>
<br>
Friday night: Well I am in the army I was running stuff around trying to get my security clearence in before I go to school to be an MP before I head out again since they lost the last one. I finish my work early since i was suppose to off for the rest of the time till like 2 days before school. I go over to Cedrics house/ roommates and go to a holloween party. We go out to eat and a good burger joint. His roommate is cool as hell she is just straght foward and no exhaust. lol As is her mom. Well I am to lazy to come up with a real costum so I just dress up like well a soldier to lazy. I had some random DCU desert uniforms laying around so I wore those. I got hammer as well as cedric and his 2 freinds hehe female. I so want to be cedric haha. Well I wake up to cedric and his freinds loud wookie upstair whatever they where doing at like 5 am I wnet to bed abour 430am. sat.Thry then take the walk of shame lol.  <br>
<br>
Well cedric and I still dont really have decks build and well Cedric is like making all sorts of crap up at the last min. its funny. ESP when Eric showed up a nd he was still building decks. I didnt help very much but whatever. I just prvided cards for everyone that need them which i never have a problem with I jsut want to trade for things I so wanted to play like 2 dannik jerico in my brangus so i could abuse that. lol  <br>
<br>

<br>
Game 1 <br>
  TRM vs SYCFA blow up the deep of Aladerran(sp?)(Eric Largent sp?)South park ref<br>
<br>
	Well my hand is great I have the falcon and han w gun, leia w gun and haric scruff. Second trun i drop falcon to db then move up to Death Star. I end up hitting him for like 4 turns of drains. As well i drop my bith to falcon retriving. He drops lat damage and star destroyer. I try and alter lat damage. I miss drew a 6. Then he drop overwelhem.falcon to used pile. I drop some epps and corron to the Death star take over the conference room. I hold the Conference room. I then track around to the falcon to the force pile and get it. He spreads becuase he lost to many cards to the drains of 3 eraly as well as the drains at the conference room he spreads and drains. I drop the falcon to the adrmial that adds to drains and track 2 5s around clear his site. I do this till he has no ships left but the executor. It beccomes a drain race I win. FW 15 <br>
<br>
Good Game I just go lucky. I used skywalkers to kill barrier.<br>
<br>
 SYCFA vs TRM Throdo<br>
	Well I was figuring that people where going to play revo and well I was right. Well I was really slow in setting up brangus. We battle on the ds like first turn and he drained me at the ds and I was like ok but i forgot to make him pay 3 me so dumb that never happend again all game. Well I through out reactor terminal and well exhaust I forgot that i had coward in hand and was being a total noobie for cycling it again. I was able to track it once again to my force pileand get it in my had to kill the drains at the death star and its sites. I set up the space with everything get out seniar fleet was well as the cantina with the emperor as well asmost of the crew he drops owen and brew combo to the echo db and moe them over to the hoth cave for drains. I drop prince xior to the cave battle he dosent draw and forfits them. I dont say anthing till he puts them in lost pile dude to it could be game breaking but sine draw if able to other wise whcih works aginst the princes game text. Well with Coward out he trys some desperation moves but i lat damage a ship luke is aboard beat it up wit h2 tie squadrons as well as zim hunter and 4lom and brangus caused 12 overflow. I almost remembered not till half way threw that when he drw destiny since it was only luke with stick that it was a 0 becuase of zim hunter I wouldnt have cared becuase I just would have done the brangus think and added more to my dif and he saw that. It becomes all one sided and well I win drain out.  fw 24<br>
<br>
Wow I am never going to play brangus again its to broken and really npe trm i think can give it a run for its money but the abuse of brangus is awsome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TRM vs BHBM Throdo<br/>
<br/>
	Well we swap fight each other I give him luke right away so that i can make him lose 1 right away. I set up a kessel drain with home one in leia like 3 or 4 turn. He then sets up search and destory. I come down with obi  kill mara then he loses one to add one i then clash mara to end the battle so he wont win and get the stacker and kill the search and destory at the same time. I set up frigan dan retrival on the home one since its pretty secure. It sucked when he monnok me used becuase I was going to take over another site but we end up in a drain race. He forgets to drain me with vader saber at the DS2 throne room. We never really duel at all becuase he is on the ropes really bad. Losing atleast 4 a turn with one form the obj along with my 3 at kessel. The game is over we both know it but he dosent want me to add to my diff so he draws up. fw by 19 or something cant remember. <br/>
<br/>
Good game I always like playing agisnt Throdo he is a good player one of the best in ATL. I never got to play skywalker grrrr.<br/>
<br/>
SYCFA vs EBOX Erick Largent<br/>
<br/>
	Well I set up brangus like 3rd turn yeah its slow. I let him set up EBO. I then set reactor termnal. I Monnok early and got the AWRI card for retrival first turn which was game breaking since it killed his retrival Get my space fleet in had as well as set up coward which is key. He drops 2 xwings to hoth one with cannon. I then drop lat damage as well ZIMH with 4lom and first strike (the first time I got that out or draw their fire out all game) Well I over load the cannons battle draw a 6 and 4 cause over flow. After that he moves over to DS cancel lat damage. We battle a couple of times in space I take EBO drains. He then moves luke to 4th marker. We go back and forth between that and the cave. I then have vader and tarkin at the 1st marker he moves luek with anakin saber to 4th marker to get coward nil for next turn. I drop down the prince to forth marker. I had previously droped a 6 with reactor terminal so I activate all the way to it and battle retrive with first strike then I set for stun luke back to hand move all my guys to the 4th marker and wait for the ice storm. It never comes down. It becomes a drain race now I have the whole Palpy crew at the cantiana. They sit and drain uncontested as well. FW 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
I win the tourney only undefeated. <br/>
