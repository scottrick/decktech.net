<blockquote><font class="bfont"> UP FRONT AND HONEST: I must apologize for this report. It isn’t as detailed as I would have liked, but I don’t know my sealed deck as well as I know my constructed deck, so it’s harder for me to recall exact events. I’ll try to give you as much as I can! Here we go.<br>
<br>
Washington High School participated in the State marching festival the night before, so I went to bed around 2:00am the morning of the tourney. I checked to see what time it was supposed to start - 12:30. Good. I get a little sleep before we play. I wake up in time to watch my Digimon (yeah, I know.) and go get Levi Buck. We drive to Shaner’s little shop of horrors and get ready to play. As we get there, Shaner is teaching a woman how to play the game against Stephen Nobles. Cool! Always glad to have new players. I hope she sticks with it. On the downside, they’re the only ones in the store. We wait awhile, and some more people show up. We finally end up with 8 players (one of the being Shaner, but who cares. It’s even) and begin first round pairings.<br>
<br>
I’m stuck trading with Levi. We agree before the packs are open that we’ll trade our rares back to each other no matter what side of the Force they’re on. He gives me Rennek and my Rep along with Kiffex, and I give him a Rancor, J’Quille (his Rep), and Murro Yine or something like that. I’ve also got a Tessek, Jedi Mind Trick, and Life Debt in my rares. Yippee. Now THERE’S a couple red cards I could do without today. I failed to get a Bargaining Table, but I did manage to grab a Signal for my starting effect. I pull no JP sites, so I’m stuck with the Antechamber. Levi, on the other hand, has the amusing luck of pulling 4 deserts - in his first 2 packs. I decide that I don’t want to reveal Tessek to my opponent too soon and I can’t use Rennek, so I use Ghoel as my rep. That was just funny. I decide that Lando and the Mercenary in the Skiff (free reacts with an exclusion weapon and 3 destinies is too good to pass up) is my main weapon, then I can sacrifice Lando and deploy Ounee Tay to get him back. Lose weapons to Force drains and let the Baragwins get them back. I decide on my tech and fill the remaining 6 card slots with high destiny easily played Used Interrupts (You Will Take Me To Jabba Now, Correllian Retort, etc).  Anyway, we start our first game.<br>
<br>
GAME 1: LS vs. Levi<br>
<br>
I have all these cool combos, but I never get them to go the way I want. My 2 Monks start heavy drains that he didn’t expect and couldn’t counter with the backup they got. Lando stopped a lone Jabba from adding a destiny as my Baragwins retrieved my lost Force. He kept battling; I excluded several characters each battle (enough to take away his desinies), and he kept losing battles. I have never played a sealed deck with this much tracking before. That’s awesome! I put Gran at the Audience Chamber with Bo Shuda and kept retrieving when he tried to beat me away at adj sites. I must remember this combo. My drains eventually won him out.<br>

PROS: This set up the tournament for me. I love this deck; I consider changing some red for more ability, but I finally decide to keep it the way it is. I’ve got some tech set up that I MUST remember in future games.<br>
CONS: If he had deployed an Audience Chamber (which I also didn’t pull), I could have put an extra card back in the deck.<br>
<br>
GAME 2: vs. Dan<br>
<br>
He’s playing Sandwhirls! I get Lando in my starting hand and beat up his lone character, then he gets lost! My elom, Baragwin, and Snivven arrive to find him, and there’s ANOTHER Sandwhirl! Why didn’t I pull any of those? So the desert is stacked pretty high with missing characters, but I eventually find them. I’ve got a lot of characters in this deck! We ran all around Tatooine. Yeah, that was about it. This was a fun game. I had Ghoel in my starting hand, and I held onto him, waiting to cancel just the right destiny. He eventually cancelled a drain of 2 at the end of the game instead. I played a Weapon Lev first turn, and I tracked it for the rest of the game. We had some harsh battles, but 23 cards in my 40 card deck are characters, so my ability and tracked high battle destinies eventually took over the game. Monks continued the drains and eventually won the game for me. Those guys are awesome! There were some seriously heavy battles (I think in one battle I drew 4 destinies, and he drew 3); he had the higher power characters, but I had the edge on forfeit, so the destinies did their work on him. This was a hard game to win, but DS just can’t counter the Monks in this environment.<br>

<br>
PROS: This was a hard game to win, but my tech, Monks, and my tracking gave it to me. That’s always good.<br>
CONS: All of my non-uniques are power 1 - even the ones I pulled and didn’t add to the deck. This is gonna suck later on.<br>
<br>
So I’m 2-0 this far, and I’m feeling much better with my progress now than in the past several tournaments. I’ve been playing well, and I hope the trend continues. It doesn’t, but what can you do? With only 8 players, every LS player is playing every other DS player and vice versa. It’s a very even playing field.<br>
<br/>
GAME 3: vs. Chris<br/>
<br/>
OMG, he couldn’t have gotten a better starting hand if he sold his soul to Satan himself. Ephant Mon is his Rep. He starts the Aud Chamber and S+V. He generates his Force and deploys Mighty Jabba to the Chamber, Ephant to the Chamber, and pulls Gailid from his reserve to the Chamber. Okay, this sucks for me. He also deploys 2 JP sites from his hand. Yeah, that really sucks for me. He even uses an Ornament to get an alien. I draw up my Force, and he draws his Force next turn. I drop a Monk and a Baragwin next door to the Chamber and save 2 Force with a Snivven in my hand. This would be my mistake. I didn’t think he could do much to me at this point. I mean, he’s got 3 ability characters on the table, and he can’t possibly have a whole lot of good stuff in his hand, right? Yeah, right. Whatever. He drops 6 or 7 high power aliens at my spot and battles. I get my Snivven; he doesn’t care. He puts my Monk back in my hand, there goes my destiny. On top of his huge power, he draws a 5 and a 6 for destiny. Two words, folks: Game Over. I lose my 2 characters and 17 more Force. That’s 19 cards; half of my deck is gone. I keep the Monk, Lando, a Merc, and the Skiff in my hand and lose everything else plus the top of my deck. I dropped a Monk outside to drain for 2 and Lando and the Merc in the Skiff at the desert next door for another drain of 2. I’m not gonna win; I just want to lower his differential a little before I die a horrible, horrible death. He battles the Monk, I react with the Skiff. I draw a 2, 2, and 5 for destiny, it doesn’t really matter. He takes out my Monk and my skiff, I take out a few of his. He easily outdrains me.<br/>

PROS: Um, um... Well, I did my cool Lando/Merc/Skiff combo to back up the Monk. That was kinda cool.<br/>
CONS: I would say he cheated, but I didn’t just cut the deck; I shuffled it, too. I guess he gets God-like starting hands against Shaner, too. Yeah, losing half my deck on turn 3 would definitely be a con.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t even feel like putting comments about this game. That sucked.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: vs. Stephen<br/>
<br/>
I got the worst starting hand in the history of all starting hands; all red, no characters, no green, no wind chimes. How much does that suck? I have to draw 2 turns to get a decent start, and that puts me behind early. Lando was a dork the entire game. First, I deployed him to the Audience Chamber to cancel a drain against his army and forgot to deploy Bo Shuda. Oops. I played Ounee Tay to get him back after he died a horrible death and deployed him later against Bane Malar and Mighty Jabba. I successfully excluded Bane, but I forgot that Choke must be used at the Control phase, so I can’t cancel his immunity to attrition, and I happen to KNOW that I don’t have the numbers to take him out just now. Oops. Mark it as horrible death #2 for Lando. I like Bo Shuda turning my characters into undercover spies. That’s cool, but it only works if you remember to deploy your cards. I was tracking 5 destinies through my deck and focusing on 2 battles on the table, so I just forgot. His power 4 characters easily took out my power 1 guys over and over again. I only have 2 destiny 1 cards in the deck (Lando and Tessek), but they were both in the Lost Pile when I needed to use Wind Chimes with my 2 Baragwins on the table. I had dropped a Monk, a Baragwin, and a Kitonak at some exterior site for a drain of 2, and he left it uncontested most of the game out of fear of a Sandwhirl, I guess. That kinda helped. His high power characters against my really low power did me in, along with my overall sucking with Lando. I played this really poorly, and it was probably partially due to the last game taking its toll on me. He outdrains me for the win.<br/>

Well, it started good, anyway. I walk away with Murtto Yire (sp?), Tessek, Jedi Mind Trick, Rancor, Life Debt, and J’Quille. That’s nice. I’d also like to get another Lando with Dildo if I can. I’ll work on it. We stay awhile after the tourney to hang out and play. I beat up a TIGIH (played by Shaner) with my HD real good. I guess he just didn’t get the starting hand he was looking for. Yeah, believe it or not, I like to make sure I have high destinies before I duel. I refuse to be drawn into it early! I drew a 6 and a 4 with Focused Attack in my hand against Obi, but he drew a 2 and a 3, so I didn’t need it. Game over. I strike that up as a win against Shaner, even though it wasn’t his deck. I don’t care. I try to get someone to play against my CRAPPY LS deck before I take it apart tonite, but no one is willing. Everyone has gone except Levi, Shaner, and me. I help him out with Touney software a little, then he finally gets me to buy a pack of Reflections. I pull a shiny Obi. That works for me. He decides he wants to open a pack and selects the one on top that I was going to get but decided to dig into the box instead. Big shock: he pulls a shiny Vader. That makes 3 for him! This is the SECOND shiny Vader that I have missed out on because someone else bought it. I guess I didn’t miss out because he bought it before me, but still, it’s frustrating. I suddenly feel upset with my shiny Kenobi, which is rather amusing in retrospect. You must realize - I now have 3 shiny Obis, 3 BB Obi, and 4 WB Obi. I have 1 - COUNT EM: ONE - Ben. At least it’s shiny. I’d like to trade for another Ben! I’d like to pull a shiny Vader, too, but I guess it’s just not meant to be. In addition to not pulling my card, Shaner jumps up and down and dances all over his store when he realizes what he’s pulled. Now I must admit that I’d do my happy dance too, but then again, I don’t have 180+ ORS. Good pulls are a little more exciting to me, so I thought. Anyhow, it was a good day. I don’t know what place I came in; I forgot to ask. I’m pretty sure Shaner won his own tournament (he was 6-0 after 3 games, and I’m pretty sure he was the only one). Good tournament, and a fun overall weekend. Aside from the 17 damage loss, I think I’m out of a slump. Yippee!<br/>
<br/>
NOTE TO BRANDON: Shaner won the tournament.<br/>

* SHANER FOR PULLING A VADER<br/>
* Me for not pulling a Vader<br/>
* Did I mention Shaner pulled a Vader instead of me?<br/>
* Brandon for making me put that stupid note at the end of the TR (tournament report)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun weekend. See you next time! <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
