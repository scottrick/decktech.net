<blockquote><font class="bfont"> TR from Pleasanton weekend of Coursant release<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
Well what can I say this week was hell.  As I ordered my stuff online and tried to come up with my LS deck my school didnt help me much.  I had some reports due that took half the night.  After some time I decided for dark to play HD Racing since with the new card you can pull out Collison and the Bridge for activation.  For LS I had no idea what to play.  I started off with a There is Good in Him with Credits will do fine for damage and a extra stacker with I feel the Conflict.  But that didnt work.  Plus with me thinking about all the dark side racing out there I didnt want to lose 11.  I tured the Good in Him deck into a racing deck taking out the Credits part and added some racing Interrupts and some high destiny(OOC) and ran it.  On Friday my stuff came and I opened it.  I didnt get that great of stuff.  Maul Ai, Qui-Gon, Mace Ai, Yoda Ai and a few supporting interrupts and a whole bunch of combo cards.  I finished off my HD racing Deck and had the normal people over for testing.  The HD deck worked GREAT it was awsome too if they werent playing racing and with character removal and dueling I was happy.  This was around 1.  We talked for a while but I didnt get to test the LS.  That was bad.  I didnt know if it would work or not.  Well we end up sleeping at 2:30-3 and woke up around 9.  We head out at 10 and wait around for a while for the TD to get there.  I fill out command card and talk with Brad Rowell and Steve Daniel for a while and were off.<br>
<br>
Decks<br>
LS:  Good in Him Racing<br>
DS:  Hunt Down Racing<br>
<br>
I dont remember how many people were there but there were alot and alot of good players.  Jeff Field was back for the first time and All of Frisco crew - Alfred Dong.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Forgot names Court Racing<br>
<br>
Well Heres were i get to test my LS deck great huh.  We start the race with him staling me out.  He draws low.  He draws up some and takes from Court.  I get a drain off!! then I move Luke over.  We race.  Draws low again but so do I.  He has 8 and I have 7.  He drops Ponda Dr E in Temp 1 so he doesnt lose from Court.  I drain and Drop Qui-Gon(Tat) to his AC.  We race and I take the lead him drawing low once again.  He draws up some saving force.  I drain for 4 and play Rend Point and Leia with gun goes to back up Qui-Gon.  I end up winning the race on this turn with his box out.  He drains and drops Iggy with gun to the AC and Mara with Saber to back up Ponda Dr E.  I play Kessel and Cptn Han in Falcon to Rend Point and Lando with Vibro and Wedge against the Mara Squad.  He tramples Lando so I move Qui-Gon and Leia over.  We have a few more battles but the drains end up too much along with the race.<br>
FW(+18)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning the Race<br>
Lows:  I dont like the deck already<br>
<br>
We finished fast so I had to give up my chair to people who didnt have one.  CRAP!!  I stand and watch Brad play Tim Green.  Brads Jedi Council Chamber start vs AOBS.  It was kinda lame to watch.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Jeff Fields fakeout HB Tatooine Mains<br>
<br>
I start to box to make him lose lots of force.  We lose Visage for the first few turns while he pulls out Dagobah with the Hutt for activation and a few Tatooine sites and a Dbay.  He gets Ben Kenobi with Saber to Cantina with Luke with saber and Caldera Righm as backup.  We keep losing the Visage as he starts up the Shuffle.  He drains for 4 and sets up his hand.  I win the race and drop Maul(C) with Stick to Mos Espa dbay and get a guy to the Holotable.  It looks like his deck is half gone now.  The drain of 4 is getting to me so I drop Vader and decide to move Vader into the Cantina along with Maul.  I try to duel out Ben but he cancels my focused and I draw crap.  He kills off Maul with Boussh, Caldera, Ben and Luke.  but I get rid of Ben and Caldera.  Im low on force and so is he.  I have Mara, Emp and a Obsession.  So I say what the hell.  I have a 5 and a 6 tracked.  I dont drain cause of Battle Order Combo and I send her in and duel.  I draw my 5 and 6 and he crosses.  I Battle and beat the crap outa Boussh.  Cause of the Duel I end up winning.  FW(+9)<br>
<br>
Game 3 <br>
DS vs Chris (car) Green Hidden Base <br/>
<br/>
I havent played against this before even though we all playtest together.  The race goes uneventful as I set up everything and he pulls systems and everything.  I get holotable with a guy and my blockade bridge out.  I get Mara to his Generic Dbay and Vader to Podrace Arena.  I have the whole Fleet in hand with Security Precautions.  He drops TK-422 to Vaders site.  He flips to Cancel my drains.  I drop Security Precautions and Probe his base for 10 force.  I move Vader to Tatooine Dbay to get away from TK.  He Drops Luke with Stick to flip me back.  I draw for Obsession and get it and move over to duel him and win.  He doesnt cross and loses the 15 for the game.  FW(+10)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Deck Works like a Charm<br/>
Lows:  Playing Someone in my car<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Paul Feldmans SYCFA mains and hand manip<br/>
<br/>
This game was horrible for me.  He flashes me and sets up his hand some.  I move Luke over for activation.  He gets Luke with Vader and keeps him the whole game.  I really couldnt do much.  I was drawing crap for destiny and not getting any of my sites.  He wins the race and takes control of space.  After that with monnoks and drop i couldnt do anything.  FL(-25)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Nothing<br/>
Lows:  Losing the race<br/>
<br/>
I go take a lunch break with Brad and Jeff to Taco Bell and get the Choco Taco.  The Choco is the on the spot brownie.  Its a Tacp made of something with chocolate outside and ice cream inside.  Everytime Ive had it at break I go 5-1.  HAHA.  We get back and wait a while for the people to get back and we start again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5  <br/>
LS crap vs Nghia Nguyens HD Racing SAC<br/>
<br/>
Man this sucks I have to play Nghia.  I personally think Nghia is the most underrated players out there.  We start off.  No flash for him and he draws low and I get descent destiny.  He drops down Vader to Dbay to stop Lukes Activation.  I move over and lose 1.  I cant get my activation out so he stacks up at the Dbay for a while with a few guys.  I actually win the race and retrieve 11.  HAHAHAH.  I get obi down to flip him back but he drops Much Anger on him so I lose 4 along with Visage for about 2 turns.  I get Qui-Gon to Arena with a saber for drains.  He plays Keffix for some reason and I play Han in Falcon there and retrieve from I did it.  We both lose from Visage and he drains.  I finally kill off Obi with On the Edge and drop Corran to Holotheatre.  I lose 7 from a bad battle were he tripled it but with the drain for 6 each turn to his 2 I end up winning.  FW(+6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Nghia<br/>
Lows:  Not Much<br/>
<br/>
We play a few games afterward which Im playing like a retard but on well.  Final Game lets RIDE.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs Dan Mochizuki WYS beatdown city<br/>
<br/>
I start the box again and he doesnt play a racer.  I lose to Visage for a while so I can get some force back.  He sets up at Tatooine with Outrider.  I get Vader to the Cantina for some force drains along with the Holotable.  He doesnt drain but sets up his Obj some more.  He sets up a alot as I take control of the Cantina with Maul and Vader.  I draw up some.  He gets his 3rd battlground with Wedge to Kessel.  I win the race on his turn and put him in the hole big time.  I drain and convert my Vader with a Vader with Saber and walk him over and duel at the Dbay.  I win and he crosses and loses 5.  After this we just drain each other with not much more interaction.  FW(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Finishing Strong<br/>
Lows:  I finish with a low diff<br/>
<br/>
I end up coming in 3rd place which is ok but Lodi Crew Member Paul McKelvy takes the tourny which is cool and he gets the Twillik Foil.  I play Nghia before he finishes his game and I just cant beat that guy.  I start trading for Plo Koon who Im gonna start collecting cause hes the man but should be power 30. One of these days.
