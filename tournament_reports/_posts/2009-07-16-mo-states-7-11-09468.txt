<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pre-tourney stuff:<br>
Id been looking forward to Missouri States every since the summer of 2008 when I realized that you could make the drive from Texarkana to Kansas City in one (long) day, that my Minneapolis Swccg homeboys would likely be there, and the turnout for the 2008 event had included 13 local players.  In addition, a weekend in KC would give me a couple days to escape the Texas heat and another opportunity for me to continue my streak of championship level events attended without earning a Day 2 bye (which stood at 6 before this event).<br>
<br>
So the Thursday before tourney, I get back to my apartment around 10:30pm after a test and start to build a DS deck for the event.  I had wanted to build an Invasion for a fun deck to use during one of the tourneys at Origins, but I hadnt found the time to do so.  Now is as good a time as any, so I throw together Tom McGees version posted on the PC site.  I make a number of changes to the decklist, but a lack of time stops me from doing everything Id like to.  Once the Invasion is finished, I make some changes to my Wookiee deck and get to bed around 3am.  I get up early, hit the shower, stop off at the campus computer lab to print off some v-slips, and head off to Kansas City.  Eight hours later, I arrive and meet up with Minneapolis players Brady Moore, Mark Peterson, and Jim Li at the house of Bradys relatives.  We spend Friday night at a Kansas City casino, and then head back to Bradys place for some sleep before the event.<br>
<br>
Saturday morning we get to watch someone steal gas from the gas station as were picking up some snacks before the tourney, and then make our way to the VFW hall where the tourney is being held.  Adam Howland, our homeboy from Minot, North Dakota, arrived before us and was chatting up the clientele.  The old vets there having breakfast have no idea whats going on, but Adam does his best to explain things.  We wait a while for more players to show up, but only two Missouri players attend, Jeff Peterson and Todd Vandenwalker.  So we get underway around 11:30 am with 7 players.  Get ready for go-time.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Wookiees vs. Brady Moores Walkers<br>
Last time I played Bradys Walkers was at ND States, and it featured an early game Nabrun followed by drawing a blind 5 for bowcaster destiny to shoot down Blizzard 1 before the blow.  Brady tells me hes made some changes since last time and points to his starting IAO combo.  I dont luckbox into another early Nabrun or bowcaster in this game, but I do get my Meditation v in my opening hand.  Since my opening hand is otherwise marginal, I dont really have anything I can do to disrupt Brady on Hoth, so I just set up my damage on Kashyyyk while he sets up to blow the generators.  He blows the generators early, and naturally Controls my attempt to reduce the damage with Atrocity.  One of the cards I intentionally lost to the damage was Bargaining Table, since Brady starts the effect that protects his drains on Hoth, and I figured that would make BT worthless.  Looking back, that was a stupid decision since BT would still work at either system, so it may have cost me the game.  Bradys walkers plays heavier space than most others Ive seen recently, meaning if things in space turned into a slugfest, Wookiees would probably come up on the short end of it.  So for most of the game, we did our damage on our own planets while my ships continually ran away from Bradys main force.  I play T-47 Formation with Meditation to cancel the inevitable Walker Garrision, and eventually get Yoda and Chewie on Hoth to block a drain every now and again.  Late game, Brady drops Igar on a generic walker to Kashyyyk against a lone Wookiee, but doesnt have a reserve so he doesnt battle.  I dont have another Wookiee to back up the lone Wookiee, so it takes me an extra turn to get enough ability there to kill Igar, effectively blocking my drain of 2 for like 3 turns.  Last turn of the game, after doing my damage, Im left with 2 life force to Bradys 4.  I can block all of Bradys drains on the next turn, but hell still do 2 YSMYL damage and do me in, meaning I need to win on this turn or I lose.  So my last gasp plan is to start a battle at every location I can and elect not to draw destiny, while hoping Brady chooses to draw his.  If he draws four destiny over the course of the battles (emptying his reserve deck), Ill initiate a battle between my two wookiees and his lone Imperial Walker with Igar, which could potentially cause him enough overflow to give me the win.  My plan doesnt actually work though, since in one of the initial battles Brady draws really high destiny and kills me with overflow instead.  Full loss by 4.<br>
0 (-4)<br>
<br>
Game 2: Invasion vs. Jim Lis WYS<br>
Jims playing the version of WYS popularized by Hollingworth that features smugglers in Chewies AT-ST and ships protected by lots of interrupts.  I start 3720 to 1 v, At Last We Are Getting Results v, and Imperial Justice v.  I do the Invasion auto-setup while Jim sets up Mirax at Tatooine and Luke at Kessel.  My first objective search makes me pull the Throne Room since my other site is activated, but Jim doesnt attempt to preemptively invade to prevent the flip.  I forget to pull my second site before I flip on my second turn, which actually causes the game to drag on for a while by reducing my drain potential.  Jim attempts to disrupt me on Naboo in the early part of this game, but I draw into the anti-smuggler droid meaning he has no hope of kicking off the Naboo sites, so he shifts his attention to Tatooine.  At this point we start to battle on Tatooine; Droid Racks looping my droids while interrupts loop his smugglers.  My destiny is ridic in my deck, so more often than not Im able to attrition away two smugglers per battle, which is huge.  In space, Jim tells me that he lost a game to Invasion where he attempt to fight in space at Naboo, so he basically leaves me alone in space all game.  Near the end of the game, once I see Outrider and the Falcon go to lost pile I start to chase him around in space and block drains, but I dont think we ever actually have a space battle.  So Im doing damage unmolested on Naboo while Jim is draining at the Tatooine and Kessel systems, and battles are raging at the Tatooine sites.  Eventually Jim drops below 15 life force and then proceeds to play It Could Be Worse and Were Doomed every turn for the rest of the game.  So instead of doing 6 damage a turn, only 2 damage is getting through.  Combined with Lukes retrieval and an On The Edge, this makes for a very long game.  In the end, though, Jim basically runs out of smugglers and interrupts in lost pile and my damage finally does him in.  Full win by 12.  After the game (Jim had also lost his first game to Adam Howland), he tells me, Looks like Im gonna have to back door a 7 person tourney.  So never accuse Jim of not being a strategic thinker.<br>
2 (+8)<br>
<br>
Game 3: Invasion vs. Todd Vanderwalkers WYS<br>
I start ALWDRv, 3720 to 1v, and Imperial Justice v again, but like an idiot I forget to stack cards on Justice at the beginning of the game.  So like a turn or two into the game, I realize my mistake, and Todd is generous enough to let me stack 3 cards on it at that point.  I do my set up on Naboo, and remember to pull all my sites before flipping this time.  Todds WYS is a nightfall spies version, and early game he sets up in space and gets Boussh, Blount v, Melas v, and Talon Karrde v to the cantina after setting up Tatooine Celebration.  On my turn, I respond with a single EPP Maul to the Cantina and battle.  I draw huge again, hitting Boussh and Talon, and killing the remaining guys to attrition.  Neither of us takes overflow, but the cantina clears.  Todd puts out Menace Fades, with drops my damage from 8 to 6 the turns it is in effect, but its easier to disrupt than Jims ICBW/Were Doomed looped (once youve run out of grabbers).  So we fight over the Tatooine sites just like the last game, but Todd has worse luck with the stuff he loses to drains, so he gets much less use out of his interrupts.  At one point he tried to attack me at the Naboo system, but my high destiny, the -3 to his immunity, and the protection provided by Dofine make the attempt futile.  Eventually I kill all of his characters on the ground, allowing me to get a total drain of 11 off which he cant stop.  He doesnt have anything to stop me from doing the same again next turn, so he draws up.  Full win by 18.<br>
4(+26)<br>
<br>
Game 4: LS vs. Bye<br>
Since we have 7 players and are playing 6 games, everyone but Brady ends up with a bye over the course of the tourney.  So this is my round to take a break, have a beer, and take some pictures of the tourney.  Check out the photos at http://www.flickr.com/photos/40529448@N08/sets/72157621350223529/detail/<br>
6(+26)<br>
<br/>
Game 5: Wookiees vs. Mark Petersons TTO<br/>
My first turn, I do the standard Wookiees play of activate and draw.  On Marks turn, he goes looking for the DS2:DB and its active, so he cant risk deploying Jerjerrod and hes already set back a turn.  On my turn, I do my two Wookiee damage, and Mark loses one from hand, and one off the top of his reserve, which happens to be the DS2:Capacitors.  Mark goes, Well there goes this game, and hes pretty much right.  I set up unmolested on Kashyyyk, while Marks only attempt to go to ground is Veers and Igar on Blizzard 1 to the Endor DB.  I respond with a couple wookiees, a bowcaster, and a tracked 5 to shoot the thing down.  He has better luck in space, chasing me between Endor and Kashyyyk, but Bargaining Table helps stop the damage.  Eventually I draw into a Tantive IV, so now there are more battleground systems than Mark can effectively cover.  I think we battle once or twice in space before I drain him out.  Full win by 16.<br/>
8 (+42)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Invasion vs. Mark Petersons Wookiees<br/>
Going into this game, both Mark and I are 5-1.  So we know whoever wins will be in the top spot going into the final.  Relatively early in our game, Jim wins big over Brady, so we also know that whoever loses will drop to third place.  Early game, he sets up on Kashyyyk while I set up on Naboo.  I play Astromech Shortage v, so I dont take much Yarua damage this game.  Mark goes to space with ACS, Luke Skywalker v, and Senator Leia, so I take a chance and drop EPP Maul on his ship to the system.  I also drop like 4 battle droids against Yarua and a Wookiee on the same turn.  I cancel Leias text with Astromech Shortage, and pay 1 to battle.  Like halfway through the battle, Mark remarks that he forgot to make me pay +2, so I go ahead and pay the extra, even though it means I can battle with my droids that turn, or save force to astromech shortage again next turn.  The battle kills Luke, which is good, but then I forget to cloak Maul so he gets blown out in space next turn when two ships and a number of pilots show up.  He also battles my droids, and neither of us takes damage, but both sides of the site are cleared.  At this point, my power 2 or 3 droids are like 3 or 4 force to get to table (2 to take them off of the racks, 1 or 2 to deploy them) compared to his power 5 wookiees that cost 2 or 3.  So he is getting a much bigger bang for his buck.  We continue to fight over the Kashyyyk sites, which may have been a bad strategy; maybe I should have tried to damage race instead.  Anyway, Im doing a decent job of killing wookiees, but a couple of times I get caught in bad battles and take overflow.  The game basically ends when like 4 wookiees attack my 3 droids and the result is 40 power to 16, killing all my droids and making me top deck 15.  I die the next turn.  Full loss by 16.<br/>
8 (+26)<br/>
<br/>
So after 6 games Mark is in first place and Jim Li is in second, demonstrating the validity of his back door strategy.  The only prizes up for grabs are a Day 2 bye and the title of MO State Champion, so the two agree to split things without playing the final.  Mark gets the Day 2 bye and Jim is crowned the 2009 MO State SWCCG Champion.  I finish in third and Brady gets fourth.<br/>
