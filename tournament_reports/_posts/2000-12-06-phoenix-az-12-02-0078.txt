Hello All!!!<br>
<br>
   Looking at my schedule for the next 2 months, I have 1 free weekend from now until the first week of February to play Star Wars. And I’m thinking of running a tournment that weekend instead. Needless to say, that when my friend Andres called me and asked if I wanted to go to Phoenix to play in a couple of tournaments up there, I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, my day job includes teaching chess at a local elementary, and there was a tournament this Saturday in Nogales. Now for those of you who don’t know Arizona geography, Nogales is 1 hours away from Tucson in the opposite direction for the 2 hour drive to Phoenix. I told him sure, I’d love to go! =) So after the chess tournament, I drove back to Tucson picked up Andres and made it to Phoenix in time for the second tournament.<br>
<br>
   The tournament was at The Outer Rim, a new stored owned by local player Chris Shaner. We arrived about 30 minutes early. There were only 4 players there, so Andres played a few games, and I looked through Chris card boxes while we waited for players to arrive. Eventually two more did, can we were ready for the tournament to start.<br>
<br>
LS - Throne Room Mains<br>
DS - Endor Operations<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs. DJ Andrews’ Court of the Vile Gangster Deck<br>
<br>
   DJ is the Arizona State champion and I know he’s a good player. Except for a Jabba’s Palace Sealed Deck game, which I lost, I haven’t played DJ in a game. He started COTVG with All Wrapped Up, Mobilization Points, and I think You Cannot Hide Forever. I started with Massassi Throne Room, the Farm, and the Swamp.  In my starting hand I had a Lukes Lightsaber, Obi-wans Lightsaber, Lando w/ Vibro Axe, and a bunch of red cards. First turn I deploy a Nudj with the Swamps gametext and check my cards in my Reserve Deck. (I see that I have a Ben Kenobi in my Force Pile. Cool!) I lose 1 Force and draw up a few until I get Ben. (Save 2 Force.) For his first turn he searches for Rendilli with Mobilization Points (Actually, he did that on my turn.), he deploys the Jundland Wastes, Mara Jade to the Audience Chamber (view the SC gametext), and her lightsaber to her (via her gametext.). Next turn I deploy Ben Kenobi, his lightsaber, and Lando w/ to the Audience Chamber. (I also deploy a Nudj to Yavin IV.) I battle Mara Jade but miss with my lightsaber. He missed with hers as well. My 2 destines clears the Mara Jade and a Ghhhk. Ben revives Lando. After that, I had a solid drain of 3 for the rest of the game.<br>
<br>
   He eventually had Boba Fett in Slave I at Rendilli, but didnt drain because his Battle Plan was hurting him too. He deployed Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith to the Jundland Wastes. Next turn I deployed Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and his lightsaber to battle him. I swing and hit, and he has to lose Vader and some force. Eventually, 4-LOM w/, Sim Aloo and Dengar w/ come to battle Jedi Luke. The lightsaber and destiny clears off all but 4-LOM who then captures Luke. (All Wrapped Up.) As hes moving 4-LOM over to the Dungeon, I was able to deploy Independence and Gold Leader in Gold 1 to battle BFinSI. After that, he drew up. Full win by 39.   2(+39)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs. Patrick Hugs You Can Either Profit By This Deck<br>
<br>
   Patrick is a good player from Phoenix. I always have very good games against him, but hes one of those players that I just cant seem to beat. Looking at this match of decks, I dont think Ill be changing that streak just yet. I dont remember what he started with, but I dont remember it being a factor in the game either. I started Endor Operations with You Cannot Hide Forever, Secret Plans, and Mobilization Points. First turn I deploy Rendilli (With Mobilization Points.) and Ominous Rumors (With my Objective.) I draw up and get Lord Vader and 4-LOM w/ in my hand. Now all I need is Vaders Lightsaber and a target. For his first turn he Deploys Ben Kenobi and his lightsaber to the Audience Chamber, but doesnt free General Solo.  Next turn I deploy Come Here You Big Coward! and a Dreadnaught with pilot to Rendilli. He deploys Lando w/ to Jabbas Palace, Mos Eisley, and frees Gen. Solo. Then Han and Ben join Lando.<br>
<br/>
   I figure Im not going to get to beat up on anybody soon, especially without a lightsaber, so I deploy Vader to the Landing Platform. Next turn he drains and hits me for 1 point of Profit damage. My turn I drain, except I was greedy and drained with Vader first. Lost in the Wilderness, and Vader goes Lost. Now I dont get the Ominous Rumors bonus at Rendilli either. So the rest of the game was him spreading out and draining on 3 Tatooine locations while Im trying to get some starships, and someone to find Vader. I eventually, get Admiral Piett to the Landing Platform. Next turn he deploys Leia w/ but I play Imperial Barrier. Then he plays Twas Khaa, but I play another Imperial Barrier. Finally he deploys Melas. (How many freakn ability 4 characters is he holding?!?) No more Imperial Barriers for me. (Doh!) Piett dies as does my chance for a win. I was able to deploy the Emperor to the Bunker to improve my drains, but it wasnt enough. Full loss by 25.   2 (+14)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs. Andres Lopezs Rebel Strike Team deck.<br/>
<br/>
   Dont you hate it when you travel over two hours to a tournament with someone and then you have to play them in a game. I guess its a good thing we played YJ last night and not SW. Andres is a good player from Tucson and weve split the 2 previous times weve played each other.  Right now he is in third place, but with a 4 points. He started Rebel Strike Team with Strike Planning, Insurrection, and Menace Fades. I started Endor Operations with You Cannot Hide Forever, Mobilization Points, and Oppressive Enforcement. Andres isnt too confident about this match up, but I actually think I have more to fear since I dont have much ground support. I search and deploy Rendilli but notice I dont have Ominous Rumors in my Reserve Pile. Well if he deploys anybody first turn, thats it for Rumors. First turn he deploys General Madine, Chewbacca of Kashyyyk , Corporal Bezzer and Wuta to the Rebel Landing Site. (Hasta La Pasta Rumors!!) I deployed U-3PO to the Rebel Landing Site, and we each started drawing up for a few turns. (He also added Portable Scanner and Chewbaccas Bowcaster to the site.)<br/>
<br/>
   Eventually I deploy Admiral Piett and Commander Merrejk to the Bunker to confront Lt. Blount and his 3 Portable Charges. General Solo and Daughter of Skywalker with Anakins Lightsaber eventually join in at the Bunker. Later I deploy DV,DLOTS, his lightsaber, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Mara Jade to the Rebel Landing Site. I deploy First Strike and battle. My choke and lightsaber each miss Chewie. He misses with the bowcaster thanks to Tarkin. He ends up only losing Pano to cover the damage and I lose Mara Jade.<br/>
<br/>
   Right now I have a Ghhhk and Projective Telepathy in my hand but no Force in my Force Pile. I start to worry because if he deploys Draw Their Fire, Im in trouble. Down come Junkin and the Concussion Grenade at the Rebel Landing Site. (No Draw Their Fire) He initiates a battle at the Bunker and plays Rebel Leadership to add a destiny.  He clears the Bunker and I Ghhhk the damage. He then initiates a battle at the Rebel Landing Site. He attempts to hit with the Concussion Grenade, but draws a Jedi Luke for destiny. (Of all the times to hope your opponent draws a 6 for weapon destiny!) I choke Chewie and light General Madine with the Lightsaber. He ends up losing someone for battle damage and I cancel his destiny with Tarkin. (Looking back, I was worried about the Grenade, but I forgot that Tarkin could have just cancelled it.)<br/>
<br/>
   Next turn Vader and Tarkin clear the Rebel Landing Site. On his next turn he destroys the Bunker, but forget that he didnt deploy the Back Door. Now all thats left in Endor is Vader, his lightsaber, Tarkin, and a whole lota rubble. I start deploying my starships and there isnt much he can do to stop me. Full win by 18.   4 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs. Andres Lopezs Endor Operations Deck<br/>
<br/>
   Dont you just hate it when you travel two hours to a tournament with someone and have to play them TWICE!! Well my Light Side Deck has a lot of mains, but not a lot of space. I know that he uses star destroyers and drains heavily. This will be a good test for my deck. He starts Endor Operations with  Operational As Planned to get the Death Star II, Moff Jerjerrod and Perimeter Patrol. I start with Massassi Throne Room, the Farm and the Swamp. In my hand Im holding Revolution and a Nudj. First turn I revolve the Bunker, and deploy the Nudj to the Landing Platform. I also search and deploy a Nudj to my Swamp and move it to the Farm. That pretty much shuts down his ground, and I thought his Force activation. But I forgot about the Death Star II in his hand, and on first turn hes able to deploy it, the first sector and Ominous Rumors.<br/>
<br/>
   I draw up a little and get Obi-wan and his ligthsaber. I also get a Tunnel Vision. Next turn I activate and play Tunnel Vision. In my Force Pile I have everything I could possible want. (Han/ w, Chewie w/, Leia w/ and the Cantina.) Im holding the Falcon, to I draw up my Force Pile. He deploys Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with Moff Jerjerrod to Endor. I deploy Obi-wan and his lightsaber to the Cantina and start saving Force. Next turn I deploy the Falcon, Han w/ and Leia w/ to Endor and battle. He loses ZinMH and Jerjerrod, and Im immune to the attrition. I move over to the Death Star II. Next turn he deploys Admiral Chiraneau on the Accuser at Endor. I deploy Chewie w/ to the Falcon. Next turn he the Executor and some unique Biker Scout pilots at Fondor, then moves to the Death Star II along with the Accuser. I battle again and he loses Elsek to cover the attrition while Im still immune. He added A Death Squadron Star Destroyer and I added Luke w/ on the Independence. Eventually I cleared the system, and drained him out. Full win by 29.   6 (+61)<br/>
<br/>
   My last game was enough to finish me in first place, just 3 points ahead of Patrick Hug. I’m not sure about the other places, but I think third went to Aaron McCormack who lost to Patrick in the last round after beating him in Game 3. I want to thank The Outer Rim for hosting the tournament, all my opponents for great games, and all the other players for make it to the tournament. I look forward to seeing everyone at the next one.<br/>
