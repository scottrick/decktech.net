<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Colorado States Tourney report!<br>
<br>
Just got home from my first states tourney ever, and my first real tourney since 2001ish, and I had a blast!  Held in Fort Collins Colorado,  at Gryphon Games.  We had a turnout of 11 people which was great!  Everyone seemed to have fun, and for the most part everything ran smoothly!  Props to Mark Van Driel for running the event and props to Regis and John from Wyoming for making the drive!  Also Props to Scott Church who lent me decks for the event!  I left during the final match between Brian Hunter and Tom McGee, but Ill assume for now that Brian Hunter is the 2008 Colorado state champ!  Congrats to him!<br>
<br>
I was playing WHAP, and Endor ops, and went 2-1 with whap and 1-2 with E-ops.  My goal for the day was to be at least 3-3 and I am proud of myself for doing that!  I believe that put me in 6th place, or tied for 6th , cant remember.  Prize support was nice, got a few good cards I needed, as well as the cool mara jade printouts.  Now on to game by game report.  <br>
<br>
My first game was vs Tom McGees QMC, with my endor ops<br>
Tom got a great start, I had nothing but red cards in my starting hand, he was able to set up early and get a good space package up and running as well as his ground package and flipped probably by 4th turn.  I had a bad start, coupled with a few nervous/rookie mistakes.  Needless to say I was playing a heavy space E-ops and never used combat response. I lose by 24<br>
<br>
Second game was my WHAP vs John from Wyos dark deck <br>
Johns deck started just the DS2 throne room, and not much else, this guy plays quirky decks (played ewoks for light side!) But he is a solid player who got 3 wins.  My WHAP pretty much owned just about everything he put out though, I had the throne room secure with Obi JK V, queen amidla, panka, jerus jannick ect.  Yoda, MOFO got dueled by lord maul, and WON I drew two 1s as destiny and he drew a site and a 1!  WOW!  Pretty much did everything right this game and had luck on my side, but no slops to John he is a good guy. I win by 25<br>
<br>
3rd game I played Regis Sonn V deck versus my E-ops<br>
This game went bad for me, and I really never got anything going.  He was able to control endor sites and I made some mistakes with endor shield and never got anywhere near challenging him at all.  He wins by 19 as I draw up to make the sting less.  <br>
<br>
4th game was my WHAP versus Toms Darkside Combat.  <br>
This was a tough game for me, it looked to be going well for me until maybe 9th or 10th turn when he was able to combat Qui w/saber for a big loss (sidous makes him OOP) then duel obi, JK v and make him oop.  Pretty much one turn decided the game, and I think he would have agreed.  He wins by 22 (think thats right.)<br>
<br>
5th game was my E-ops vs Ryan Hs sorta goldenrodhat but not really deck<br>
Ryan was playing a careful planning start with tatooine, outskirts and touché station.  (ha MS word makes touché have an accent!) He played mace v to outskirts and moved over to touché, and his deck played pretty much mains and toys from there.  Endor ops worked perfect for me this game and I was able to set up ominous rumors, got the at-ats and at-sts on the ground, and pretty much dictated the whole game.  Was draining for at least 6 for much of the late game.  I win by 20<br>
<br/>
6th game was my WHAP vs Mark Van Driels mistryl<br/>
Wow!  This was a very tight fun game!  I probably played the best game of star wars Ive ever played.  Mark and I tested this match up the day before and he dominated me.  I know Scott Church pretty much made this WHAP to beat mistryl, and it played well.  I only made one mistake playing we dont have time for this when he had guri down who cancels extra bd.  But basically I got flipped pretty early, made some good plays and honestly by the end of the game was tired from the whole day and just wanted to finish it out.  Made some errors at the end and eventually got a timed win by 22, but that doesnt really show how close and fun this game was, big ups to mark for this game as I had a bunch of fun.  <br/>
<br/>
So I finished with 3 wins(1 timed) and 3 losses and a +2 differential.  Which for me was a great result!  Everyone played great and had a good time, SWCCG is back in Colorado!  <br/>
