<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <b>Introduction</b><br>
<br>
This is my first tournament report, with the scene barely alive where I play I thought it would be fun to write up a TR since we only have one or two locals a year. This was a small local with 9 players, good vibe, mostly Dutch players with the exception of former European Champ Stefaan Lambrecht from Belgium. <br>
<br>
Sometimes we have more players, particularly from Germany but for various reasons some players had to cancel.<br>
<br>
Decks that I saw: LS showed Speeders x 2 (including my own), Rebel Senate x2 and WHAP, DS showed Senate, Walkers objective, Black Sun, SYCFA big blue, Endor Ops big blue, and my own Hunt Down V. Not counting the decks that I borrowed to Koen (Invasion, Wookies) who had his own decks temporarily unavailable, and the decks I did not notice.<br>
<br>
For LS I played Local Uprising V with Falcon V and weapons + a lot of Special Edition interrupts. It seemed to me it had mostly solid matchups though the differential would never be high.<br>
<br>
For DS I played Hunt Down V with a small space presence in the form of bounty hunters + Blonde Leader. Double Back to pull the bounty hunters and get some extra retrieval with Juno, One Beautiful Thing to have some extra immunity in space. I had expected Watch Your Step, Profit and TRM because they seem to have been popular at worlds. None were played and much to my chagrin somebody else got it into his head to play Speeders too, a dreaded match for my Dark Deck....<br>
<br>
Dennis Hes eventually won the tournament with the Walkers and Speeders objectives. We only played 4 matches in total because we didn't feel much like playing a new round because the games had been long and the differentials were not close enough to motivate a 3rd round.<br>
<br>
<b>Match 1: Koen vd Velden, Wookies vs my Huntdown V deck.</b><br>
<br>
This was an unfair match and Koen is inexperienced, he had to borrow my deck! I advise him to start with Commando Training &amp; Klor Slug because of Evazan/The Force Unleashed. His inexperience showed on his first turn, deploying a lone Lando V. I deployed Lord Vader with saber to the same Kashyyyk site and gave mr Calrissian a beatdown. He plays some Wookies on the other site but I could upload IG-88 with gun with my objective, still being flipped. Deploy him with Mara, battle, I capture 1 Wookie and prevent his BD, another beatdown. <br>
<br>
Later on he gets rid of Vader with Princess Leia V + Padme and a Wookie, even doing some slight overflow due to me drawing some horrible destinies (I drew three destiny-1s in a row at some point, I had The Dark Path V out but none of my Sith Furies V) while he top-decks two fives. But I deploy a second Vader and hold the two sites pretty easily. <br>
<br>
Finally I drain out the game comfortably with Galen's Fighter at Nal Hutta with Danz Borin V and Blonde Leader in the pilot seats. <br>
<br>
FW +27.<br/>

<b>Match 2: Dennis Hes, Walkers objective vs my Local Uprising V</b><br/>
<br/>
The great battle of Hoth. Even though I lost this was the best match of the game. I had teched some cards against Walkers: Power Harpoon and Dual Laser Cannon V (pulled them with Portable Scanner, starting Rycar Ryjerd V. I had chosen this setup over Superficial Damage V because Rycar could also pull the immensely important Han's Toolkit which I would need against Big Blue decks). Unfortunately, Dennis had his share of tricks to pull against me...<br/>
<br/>
I go for a solid setup, trying to prevent him from ever getting to the 2nd marker by stacking Speeders at the 4th Marker. The energy shield prevents him from an early deployment close to the Shield Generators. I flip my 4th turn with help from Incom Engineer.<br/>
<br/>
He can do some ping damage with YMSYL but has a mediocre start. He does quickly find his Space Vader with Personal Shuttle, to land on the 5th marker, but not much space otherwise so I can get the Falcon V with Concussion Missiles to the system with Chewie V and General Solo V along with Frostbite and Haven. <br/>
<br/>
The latter were shortlived as he plays Tatooine Maul in ship to Hoth...bummer, but I get rid of the ship the next turn with Stay Sharp and play another Frostbite V. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile he is amassing some power with Fett V, General Veers and a second Walker. He has Electrorange Finder and is no longer bothered by the shield, but had already deployed the At-AT cannon on Blizzard 1. Since the weapons cannot be transfered during move phase but deploy phase, he has to risk defending against my 3 speeders: Rogue 1 having the cannons and Rogue 2 the Harpoon, Rogue 3 there as well with Wedge who had pulled One More Pass for me. Before I <br/>
initiate however, he Set For Stuns Luke with a tracked Dark Maneuvers for destiny, and I when I shoot with the Harpoon, he senses One More Pass. A destiny of five had still been adequate, but I draw a 4, and unfortunately this was not the Snow Trench...He had some serious power because he also had Vader and Fett outside of their Walkers. I manage to limite the damage by only losing Rogue 1+Luke and a Padme. <br/>
<br/>
After the carnage he can confortably move close enough to <br/>
the Shield Generators to blow them up, placing my objective out of play. I limit the damage to 5 with Atrocity v.<br/>
<br/>
He does the same SFS combo trick against my second Luke later in the game. The princess was that I had wasted my Inconsequential Barriers earlier to peek in my force pile because I didn't want to have Chewie V left there. He also kept tracking his Dark Maneuvers because I had grabbed his Imperial Command instead. <br/>
<br/>
The other mistake was not having Dash Rendar V in the Roque 4 at the site where I was stacking. After the travesty that should have been the winning battle for me, I spread out with my remaining speeders, setting up Battle Formation. <br/>
<br/>
I still have my space presence, some retrieval and can keep the game close, able to play Battle Formation but he still wins, with 10. GG, well played Dennis.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Match 3: Frans Zwiers, SYCFA Big Blue vs my Local Uprising V</b><br/>
<br/>
Another match that I was prepared for. Will it work?<br/>
<br/>
I setup shop on Hoth and play T-47 Battle Formation as soon as I can, paying for my drains before he has 3 BG's. This was good as he loses a lot of important ships from his life force. I wait with the Falcon V until after I flip and have my Planet Defender Ion Cannon on Hoth. <br/>
<br/>
Frans does little damage in the meantime but manages to find Palpatine for the docking bay. He is playing Star Destroyers with a lot of immunity to attrition, with help from KDY v, Admiral Motti v and WIAPN as well as Alert My Star Destroyer. <br/>
<br/>
He steers clear from Hoth, choosing Sullust to drain at instead, hoping I go for the bait...which I do. I forgot about the gametext and play Haven to help out the Falcon V: cheaper deployment and destiny adding to hopefully exhaust his Imperial Justice V. <br/>
<br/>
However, he only comes to Hoth with...there he is to haunt me once more, Tatooine Maul in Ship! I do not know what he is doing in a Big Blue deck but he got the combo out without Combat Response and again I saw Frostbite V and Haven cancelled, now losing force to Sullust as well. Fortunately my flipside absorbs 3 damage for me, but still. I do the same trick I did against Dennis and shoot down the Infiltrator (cloaked this time) with Stay Sharp + Concussion Missiles. <br/>
<br/>
Later on, he decides to move to Hoth with his few SD's to battle as he cannot win the damage race. One has Thrawn, the other one is Conquest with Admiral Motti v. I have all the special edition interrupts to handle his space in combination with the Ion cannon and missiles. Ion Cannon shoots and hits Thrawns ship, which becomes power 0 and hyperspeed 0 permanently. I shoot it with Intruder Missile and play both Stay Sharp and Power Pivot. He forgets to use <br/>
Conquest v against Power Pivot but it doesnÂ´t matter much since Thrawns ship was hit anyway plus my power and immunity was too high already. I also cancel the complete immunity of Conquest with Direct Assault (it was put in because of Executor). Han's Toolkit saves my butt too. Thus, I win the battle for the Hoth system. <br/>
<br/>
I win the game with 12 but as Frans points out it should have been more, 18 to be exact (no Haven, no Sullust damage).<br/>
<br/>
FW +12<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Match 4: Dennis Hes, Local Uprising V vs my Huntdown V.</b><br/>
<br/>
Yawn, this is an autoloss, really nothing I can do to turn this around...hate those type of games and cannot hide it (sorry Dennis). The Force Unleashed is no longer of use against speeders because of the new virtual Shield Generators as well as Maneuvering Flaps combo. I would not have minded ANY other matchup, this is the ONLY one I really don't stand a chance against. So...<br/>
<br/>
I try to squeeze out the lowest differential possible. But I draw 0 characters early so cannot setup fast drains on my Endor sites before he gets Menace Fades. Luckily I also run POTF to have a steady drain of two with Palpatine. I put Vader on the other Endor site. Later on, some better stuff comes in the form of Death Mark which can target Captain Han as well as Emperor's Power V which is good because I have Vader as well. <br/>
<br/>
Dennis flips me back very quickly with Leia on a Hoth site while saving up force for reacting all of his speeders. Before I have 3 BG's he also plays T-47 Battle Formation to deal a decisive blow.<br/>
<br/>
I put Blonde leader in Galen's Fighter on Nal Hutta and am draining him for a measly total of four, but at least I have free drains. Danz Borin is no use in space as he is canceling all my bonuses. Mara and Dre &amp; Baba turn out to be useful, blocking some drains later in the game. With Dre &amp; Baba, I had made the mistake of not noticing Dennis' mistake of not saving force for reacting one turn, activating all of my force instead of leaving a destiny 6 in reserve. <br/>
<br/>
Evazan is battled by Zev, draws a 5 but outpowers Zev so he is forfeited as well. Sitting on the site also prevented some extra retrieval by Frostbite V so it was not a terrible idea. Also helpful was as Protocol Failure (twice, retrieved with Lightsaber Deficiency which was instantly grabbed). <br/>
<br/>
Dennis had a lot of cards on table with stuff like Rendez Vous point, First Transport Is Away, extra speeders and what not, but it was of course a match he could have won with his eyes closed. I manage to keep him as low as 9.<br/>
<br/>
FL -9. <br/>

<b>Props:</b><br/>
+Paul van Hoorne for organizing all these tournaments for the past years;<br/>
+No apparent LS dominance. I must also say I had way more DS ideas than LS for which I had chosen boring Speeders;<br/>
+Completely unpredictable meta;<br/>
+Good atmosphere, not too competitive but mostly a decent play level;<br/>
+The Great Battle Of Hoth, replaying Empire Strikes Back (well you know who loses in the movie...);<br/>
+Dennis Hes never having lost with Walkers so far all these years (is this still true?);<br/>
+Special Edition interrupts that work with starship weapons (even Direct Assault), they're all aces;<br/>
+Stay Sharp shooting down Infiltrator TWICE;<br/>
+Planet Defender Ion Cannon...for Big Blue p0wnage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Slops:</b><br/>
-Sullust....RTFC Floris;<br/>
-Tatooine Maul canceling Haven+Frostbite TWICE;<br/>
-Encountering another speeders deck;<br/>
-Wasting Inconsequential Barriers AND my grabber...I should have played better in the Walker matchup;<br/>
-only having a local like this twice a year...<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conclusion</b><br/>
<br/>
Overall, a nice tournament and as always we get our entrance fee more than compensated with some excellent prize support. We might play again as soon as February so I'll have some time to decide on a fresh LS deck. I really believe speeders are very solid in any matchup but you <br/>
never win big and only the space part of the deck is fun. <br/>
<br/>
As for Huntdown V, I thought it was fresh and would have liked to see it perform vs other mains decks, I like that it has a good 0-side, dealing direct damage with lightsabers and the space package is enough to keep opponent from spreading or hold your own system for free drains. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
