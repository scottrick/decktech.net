<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Civil War...Isn’t that an oxymoron?  Not in Coruscant it isn’t.  This was a great tournament to run given the sportsmanship and upbeat attitide all of the participants brought to the gaming table 45 players congregated in Syracuse, NY on 11/4/2000 to see who would unthrone the reigning champ, Chris Terwilliger. <br>
<br>
This is the Director’s report, so I will not mention specific player’s decks or tech.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Boring Pre-tournament stuff:<br>
<br>
Well, I left the Philly area at about 5:15pm and met Mike D’Amboise at SUNY Binghamton at about 8pm.  We head to Ithaca College to stay with Brian Twigg and playtest before the great event.  On the way we talked about a lot of SW and non SW stuff, and I made another friend because of this game.  We storm Twigg’s dorm with a rousing ’WHAZAAAAAAAAP?!?!’ and after a few minutes we’re playtesting and talking about how great the tourney is gonna be.  Mike has this really whacked LS deck that Sokol was bringing for him, but to playtest he printed out the card titles and cut them up and put them in my HB deck sleeves as proxies.  It beat both of us pretty handily and we were looking forward to see what it would do for real.  We crash sometime around 2am I think and we’re up at 8am to get some McFood and get to Syracuse by 10am.  We find Brentson, Janiak, Mike VanZander, Brett Kingery, and a few of the other Rochester crew waiting for us and the store to open.  Between then and 11am people wander in and we get started with game 1 at about 11:20am.<br>
<br>
The Tourney:<br>
<br>
This was the second big tourney I’ve ran at this store.  They also have Pokemon and Magic leagues on Saturdays, and we scared all the regulars with our well-behaved masses.  After pairings were made and we started, I wandered around to check out the various deck types.  Versions of Court, TatOcc, SYCFA/blue, BHBM, Hunt Down, 3/5 Hoth start, Old-skool blue, Bounty Hunting, and one Rops deck were popular for the Dark side.  The light side decks included versions of EBO, HB/X-swarm, Profit, Palace Raiders, Y4 mains, MWYHL, Mains and Toys on Tat and CC, and even a Massassi Ops deck!!  throughout the day, rulings were fairly routine, and any questions that I couldn’t answer right away were easily found in the CRD or by one of the 6 other SM’s in attendance.  <br>
<br>
I was a little nervous right after the first game started because Matt Sokol approached me to say that he only had 59 cards in his deck.  I said fix it and get on with your game and his opponent, Reid Smith from Rochester, was a little upset that Matt had seen his starting ensemble and had the chance to add a card. I told him to not worry about it and just play.  I was a little concerned that this would set up a sour day, but Reid beat Matt in game 1 and I figured it was all good.  I found out as I paired game 2 that they had also played the wrong allegiances, so I made them play again rather than try to repair 43 players.  (I was running command cards without software and averaged less than 5 minutes between games doing pairings... )  <br>
<br>
Rulings questions that popped up were as follows:  <br>
<br>
1.  If PotF is deployed on the Y4 War Room where Vader is hanging out, does Hunt Down flip immediately or does the opponent get the chance to alter it?  I said the Objective flipped immediately... <br>
<br>
2.  If Dr. E is "clashed," can he still operate on opponent’s characters?  I said yes because he’s present (per errata) and he can operate outside of battle parameters (eg control phase or anytime if disarmed is played)  I also ruled that if he was in a vehicle he couldn’t.<br>
<br>
3.  If a character returns to Tatooine Docking Bay 94 from Home One docking bay from Home One at Alderaan, is Our Most Desperate Hour completed?  I said yes.  I also thought that the character’s presence in the H1 docking bay would satisfy "at Alderaan" but others said no and the player moved from the DB to the "bridge" of H1.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tournament Status:<br>
<br>
Here is how the top spots were held at various points during the tournament:<br>
<br>
After Game 2, Lingrell, Ziagos, Dalton, CTwigg, Mike D’Amboise, Joe Gagliardi, DSokol, BTwigg were all 2-0 (in that order)<br>
<br>
After Game 4, Ziagos and BTwigg were 4-0, and Dalton, MSokol, CTwigg, Lingrell, Joe Gagliardi, and Rich Haman were 3-1 and rounded out the top 8.<br/>
<br/>
BTwigg beat Ziagos in game 5 by 23, Dalton beat Brian in game 6 by 13.  At this point no one is undefeated an it is still anyone’s trophy.<br/>
<br/>
After game 6 the top 8 (in order) were:   Dalton, Ziagos, Praskac, BTwigg, DSokol, MSokol, CTwigg, and Lingrell.<br/>
<br/>
After game 7 the top 8 (in order) were:   Dalton, BTwigg, DSokol, CTwigg, Ziagos, Spencer Hamblen, Praskac, and Brentson.<br/>
<br/>
Final Pairings for game 8 were:<br/>
<br/>
1.  BTwigg (ls) v. DSokol<br/>
2.  Ziagos (ls) v. Dalton<br/>
3.  CTwigg (ls) v. Praskac<br/>
4.  Hamblen (ls) v. Kippel<br/>
<br/>
At this point, many of the top 8 players had played each other in this alignment and the pairings were adjusted accordingly.    <br/>
<br/>
CTwigg beat Praskac by 25 somewhat quickly and Praskac demanded a rematch.  Apparently he got a lousy draw and CTwigg took it to him.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly afterwards, Brian reported that he beat DSokol by 2 in a close one.  If Dalton wins then he wins the tourney by diff. over Brian, but if Ziagos wins....  well we have to wait for that one as Kippel beat Spencer Hamblen by 13.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, Pat and Mike are thoughtful and methodical players, so we knew it would be a nail-biter.  Mike had owned Pat in game 7, beating him by 22.  After about 45 minutes it looked like Pat had the game and wrapped it up with a 16 card win over Mike, thus assuring BTwigg’s victory.<br/>
<br/>
Brian also won 2 special awards when his differential after game 5 was +69 and after game 7 was +77 (because you get 8-more, of course!!)<br/>
<br/>
42 people started at game 1, 3 people joined late, and 2 people left early (hence the unusual differential towards the end of the standings).  A few of the players had "bye" games at vavious points in the tournament, but for games 1,5, and 6 we had even pairings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
