<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pre-Tournament:<br>
<br>
For me the preparation for this tournament started earlier in the week, when I started to plan ahead and see what all I needed done.  Being a resident assistant, RA, I had a lot of crap to finish, while working on homework and building decks.  So I did mostly everything that I needed to get done, and on Thursday night I packed all of my decks, but leaving my extra cards and binders in my room so I could take some homework to do, costly move, plus who the hell takes homework to a tournament.  So I get to bed and figure I will get up early and pick up my car, well I like to sleep and I have to skip my first class so I can get my car and fill it up with gas.  I go to my second and final class, which lasts forever.  Got out of class, got my car packed and headed out of Indiana.<br>
<br>
I roll into Putzburgh around 2:30, half hour before R. Smith is going to arrive at my house, but I still have to pick up Pat My Johnson, who is still a 30 to 45 minutes away.  I get out to his college, but cant find it at first.  Pick him up and head back to my house, where R. Smith is chillen with my mom.  PMJ and I arrive at my house, I grab some extra commons out of my big box o commons and we head out for Maryland.  We get stuck in typical Putzburgh rush hour which slows us down.  We finally get into Maryland around 10:00 and meet up with Team Ohio.  We start to talk about decks, order some pizza and do some playtesting.  Afterwards we sit around making changes to our decks, and this is where everyone decides to play Scum for dark and all but Nate Autoplay Meeker and The Brad Eier to play WYS (V).  <br>
<br>
It gets around 1:00 and Meeker and Booker want to hit up Dennys to continue their tradition, aptly called THE DAMN BROWNIE, TDB.  We order drinks, I order a strawberry shake, worse move of the night, and Booker points to TDB, and says, we want five of these.  We TDB, and everyone is pwning it, but me.  Knowing it was the shake that filled me up, I still try my best to finish TDB, but fail.  We head back over to the hotel, I check the weather for the tournament and we all head to bed.<br>
<br>
The next day, we get up early for the free food.  Shower and get ready for the tournament.  After checking out we sit in the lobby, fill out deck lists and come up with names for the decks.  Around 11:30 R. Smith, Patty J., and myself head out before Team Ohio to make it look like they werent going to show up.  We get their around 11:50, pay and sit around till 12:10 for it to start.<br>
<br>
My decks:<br>
Dark Side: Scum<br>
Light Side: WYS (V)<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
My DS vs. Steven Yeagerbombs Hidden Base w. Vettes<br>
Ok, one of the decks I knew I was going to see, so I started You Cannot Hide Forever instead of Crossfire (V) to go and get Search and Destroy.  I get that, and then get Jabba, and some other characters down, but I have no ships or anyone I can put on ships.  His turn he just gets some systems out and my turn.  Drain, get Bane (V) out, HUGE, and draw.  He then deploys Tantive IV (V), Luke Skywalker (V) and Quad Laser Cannons to Tatooine.  On my turn I throw Luke? Luuuuke! (V) on Jabba and then draw.  We sit there until I get some ships, and he gets Padme (V) on a random vette.  I go to space with Jabbas Space Cruiser (V) and Lando (V).  He battles, I react with Zuckuss (V) and Mist Hunter (V), he hits the Hunter, by using Sorry About the Mess Combo, and we clear.  The game stays like that till I find his system, deploy BFBH and Mauls Sith Infiltrator to Tatooine with Tat Occ.  I Drain for the win. <br>
<br>
Full Win <br>
<br>
Pros: Getting set up fast<br>
Cons: Getting shot down in space<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
My LS vs. Ron Fosters Hunt Down<br>
As we set up, I quickly realize I am missing a card I wrote on my deck list, exhaust!  I quickly ask Aglets if I can go and get it and borrow an All Wings Combo from Meeker.  So after this I sit down and smile, Hunt Down SWEET.  His first turn, nothing, mine, I get the sites out with Laudica, Gen Solo and Palejo Reshed.  His turn he gets out Vader (V), WTF and Fett (V8) to the Blockade Flagship DB, HUGE!  On my turn, I have a Control &amp; Tunnel Vision in my hand, search my force pile and find Uncontrollable Fury, FTW!!!  I deploy it, get Luke out to Kessel.  He deploys The Emperor (V) to the site where I am, the Swamp, he tries to zap Han, bit misses, thank you I Wonder Who They Founder (V), he doesnt battle.  I drain and move.  He then deploys Maul With Saber in front of my guys, I barrier.  I continue to drain and move my guys over in front of The Emperor.  He tries to drain at the Jungle, opps, and he then moves The Emperor over.  I end the game by out draining him and Uncontrollable Fury<br/>
<br/>
Full Win<br/>
<br/>
Pros: Uncontrollable Fury and I Wonder Who They Found (V)<br/>
Cons: None<br/>
<br/>
So after two games I am 2-0, WTF!  and in fourth place.  I have to play light again, sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
My LS vs. Nick Reisch ISB<br/>
Hmm, interesting, not a match-up I was thinking about.  His first few turns he just drew up cards, while I set up three guys at the Swamp.  He continued to drop sites and draw, till on one turn he dropped 7 guys down, one to each site and Maul in his ship to Tatooine, luckily I had Grimtaashed his Tat Occs. away earlier.  For the rest of the game we each drained and I chased after Maul with Luke, I had Dash at Tatooine and Mirax at Corellia.  What I should have done was moved Corran Horn in front of one of his guys with Weapons Display (V) or put Corran on the Outrider to make him cloak the infiltrator.  Not doing that cost me the game.<br/>
Full Loss -2<br/>
<br/>
Pros: Grimtaashing away Tat Occ<br/>
Cons: Forgetting Artoo In Red 5 and the Obj<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
My DS vs. Micah Woolen Endor Mains<br/>
Ok, a deck I knew I would have to play, but a Battle Plan Combo start???  Interesting So I get Jabba, Bib, and Boelo out first turn then he gets General Solo and Mon Mothma, Tyderium with Lando piloting at Endor, hmm ok So I then get Xizor with the two Tuskens out to the Lower Passages, and he throws down Frozen Assests, no shield, FTL!  So on his turn he then plays Mace, Free Luke and Angry Chewie out, battles Courage of a Skywalker, Jedi Presence 52&gt;19, ouch!  So for the rest of the game we drain, I do get Bossk In Bus to the system with Tat Occ, but it isnt enough.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss -12<br/>
<br/>
Pros: None really<br/>
Cons: Scrubing out with no shield<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so after four games Im now 2-2 with a differential of 14, not bad, I still have an outside chance<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
My LS vs. Jonathan Dansburys Hunt Down<br/>
Sweet another Hunt Down, and by the looks of it Dansberry has never seen WYS (V).  So her gets out DVDLOTS from the Blizzard 4, I set up and go to Kessel with Luke eventually.  He throws down Zuckuss in MH.  So from this point on we fight over Kessel, I beat him every time, and forget the obj, but I have Legendary in my hand the entire game, and he never loses ZiMH, WTF!  So when he finally does I play Legendary on the Outrider and drain out.  After the game he thinks that if he would have put back The Phantom Menace after losing Maul, he put Maul on ZiMH, he would have had an extra force and would have been able to win.  With P. Johnson looking on, he tries to tell Dansbury that if I had made him lose to Legendary it wouldnt have mattered.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win 2<br/>
<br/>
Pros: Hard fought game on both sides<br/>
Cons: Forgetting about the obj, Legendary and losing Uncontrollable Fury early in the game<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
My DS vs. Brandon Ruck Tat CP(V)<br/>
Great another Tenneessee light deck.  I set up in the Audience Chamber, he comes down, with Leia (V) Mace, Luke and basically pwns me there, I still have Jabba, and move him.  He then tries to get to Jabbas site to kick the living crap out of me with Nabrun Leids, but thankfully I have Ghhhk Combo since the beginning!  Phew!  So from this point on I run he drains I get out Arica to block the drain, but eventually he spreads out and then drains for the win.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss -20<br/>
<br/>
Pros: Ghhk Combo saves the day, for the moment<br/>
Cons: Beat downs suck!<br/>
<br/>
So I end up at 3-3 -4, 17th overall, not bad, but not what I was hoping for.  <br/>
<br/>
Post Tournament<br/>
<br/>
So we stand around waiting to see what happens with Reid and Justin, Justin and Pistone come to an agreement, but Reid and Steven Lewis have to play it out.  We watch the first game, Reid wins, and then Lewis doesnt want anyone watching the second game.  Play a few games of the Jabba Beats Challenge, fun game, ask Eier for the rules.  Find out Reid loses, and Justin and Lewis make their deals.  So Ruck wants a picture and everyone leaves.  We get back into the R. Smith 1 and Reid wants me to type up a report for him, only to have my computer battery die on me, gay!   I fall asleep, and we roll into Putzburgh around 8:00, oh wait 9:00 in the morning, freakin day light savings time, and I take Patty J back to W &amp; J.  I get back to my house, hang out before I go back to IUP.<br/>
