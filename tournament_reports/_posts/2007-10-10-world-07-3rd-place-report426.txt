<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well I’m sitting at about 15 pages single-spaced before I add in pre, post, and mid tournament stuff. So I’m going to call it and not bother talking about that.<br>
<br>
My first SWCCG games of the weekend came in the team tournament. I teamed up with one of my friends from BC (#4 in country WHAT), Mark Neumann. I was playing an HBX based off of Matt Sokol’s HBX from Kashyyyk regionals/MA states. It wasn’t quite as good because we don’t have all the cards. This is a running theme. Mark built this HBX mostly out of the cards he owns. By cards he owns I mean cards Mike Pistone and Lee Edwards donated to him. Pistone gave him literally a backpack full of commons and a bunch of good premiere rares and Lee gave him a ton of EPPs and some other stuff. The generosity of these two is also a running theme, so next time you see them tell them how awesome they are.<br>
<br>
So anyways, back to the tournament. The start of the tournament was delayed so that players from day 1 could compete. I was like the only one glad about this because my teammate competed in day 1. For day 1 Mark was using the HBX out of mostly his cards and an IG out of mostly mine. Unfortunately he finished 5th so no day 2 bye for him. By the end of the tournament he felt he had a better handle on the IG so he stuck with that and I played the HB.<br>
<br>
I don’t remember the diff of any of these games. I just treated this as a fun tournament and it certainly was.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our first game was against Team Texas: Michael Richards and J.W. Millet.<br>
<br>
My HBX vs Michael Richards’ Bespin CRv<br>
He gets a poor starting hand and just draws. I get a very good hand with evasion and such, so I drop a few X-wings to systems and such, I think I got Luke out first turn. He gets free Executor out his second turn and he starts setting up his CC sites. The only ship in his deck was Executor and he went the wrong way to find my base so it took him 5 turns to probe it. During that time I pretty much just drained big and cancelled his drains so it was a rough matchup for him and he lost the coinflip of which way to go from Bespin. He probed eventually but it was too little too late.<br>
<br>
Mark won his game also, his IG vs. J.W. Millet’s TRM. Very impressive from someone who just started playing a few months ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next we face the team of Reid Smith and Brian Hunter. I had never played either of them before this (in person) but I’ve heard they’re ok.<br>
<br>
My HBX vs Reid Smith’s IG<br>
He sets up IG first turn, grabs Han. I get Gen. Calrissian on Gold Squad. 1 to deny him Lando. Basically he sets up his hand for a while and after a few turns he has S&amp;D, Emperor and Janus at the AC, IG and Vader at the carbo chamber. I’m flipped and have an x-wing most places, maybe two systems I have a matching ship. Anyways he gets Maul down somewhere and I barrier. He probes but it’s not the base. Next turn he drops Zuckuss to Kessel against my lone X-wing and although I drew last turn I don’t have any evasion. I get really lucky though as he draws a 0 for battle destiny. I lose a card, he moves Maul over to back up Zuckuss at Kessel.<br>
<br>
Now I do some math. I have a plan that if it works will win me the game. I figure that it probably won’t work, but in the end I conclude that the chances of it working are higher than my chances of winning if I don’t try it. So I activate to 11 force and play all wings. I check my deck and Corran is in it. So I play RS7 and an X-wing to kessel. I drop the war room and Incom so I now have 8 ability for Zuckuss. Load RS7 with a cannon, shoot maul out and overflow Zuckuss for 8. From there it’s a very close drain race. I get obi to the forest satisfying BP and S&amp;D. He kills obi with Mara but next turn I land an X-wing and he has no answer. The free drains let me edge out a close win by 2.<br/>
<br/>
Mark lost to Hunter playing MWYHL. After the game Reid tells me that he had a Cease Fire! in hand but forgot to play it to stop me from shooting the cannon. So I benefited from a very rare mistake on his part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are 3-1 at this point with one timed win. We now face Angelo Consoli and Sibille Schontanf.<br/>
<br/>
My HBX vs Angelo Consoli’s docking bay HD<br/>
He got vader going like turn 2 and s&amp;d turn 3 which was nice. He monnoked me and got 2 hyper escapes and 2 barriers. Then he goes to kessel with zuckuss and crossfire which rocks me pretty badly. Also he probes so that’s harsh. I probably shouldn’t have had kessel as my base but before I started playing I committed to choosing my base randomly and kessel was the card I randomly selected. Well, long story short he did more damage than I did and he won.<br/>
<br/>
Mark lost to Sibille’s LSC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our final game is against the other Texan team, Joseph Graham and Thomas Whaley.<br/>
<br/>
My HBX vs Thomas Whaley’s MKOS. The key card of this game was Hutt Influence, or something. At any rate, I couldn’t cancel his drains on Tatooine but it was late and I misread it like I couldn’t cancel any of his drains. So I didn’t cancel a few of the drains that I should have. He ended up cancelling all of my kessel drains with den of thieves or his objective so he outdamaged me. <br/>
<br/>
Mark lost to Thomas Whaley, I don’t remember what Thomas played.<br/>
<br/>
So I went 2-2 in the team tournament but that’s ok because I didn’t really take it all that seriously and I met some great peoples. My opponents were all class acts and it was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways nothing really happened between day 1 &amp; 2 since the team tourney finished up wicked late. I had both of my decks ready for day 2 already so I just went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
These are my decks from memory so maybe they’re a card off but I don’t think so. Lee Edwards was the man because I wanted to play a Hunt Down but just didn’t have the cards for it. So he offered to build it for me. That was awesome. He literally went through all of his cards and built a deck that I sent him. Again, next time you see him tell him how amazing he is. My Hunt Down is essentially KToD back door huntdown with a few modifications of my own.<br/>

Conduct Your search no matter what as either the back door or blast door controls will be played in every matchup. Other than that it depends. Against Mike Gemme’s LSC day 3 I started First Strike and AAAv but against his WYS day 2 I started Crush The rebellion and Crossfire v.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so there has been some questions as to why I play with the Vaders I do and I’ll try and explain my reasoning. I play HD wicked aggressively. If they put a guy at a site chances are I’m battling him soon. Even Vader will do the heavy lifting from time to time. So often I’ll be deploying him to their planet and not to the back door. Most times I won’t even play the back door because I like getting the choke on them. So it really comes down to if I want to pay 8 for my vaders (10 with goo nee tay) and that’s a no. The 1 extra immunity and immunity to uncontrollable fury is not significant enough to me to merit playing Lord Vader over the other vaders, especially when they both have excellent game text as well. Math vader is really nice for breaking immunity but especially for adding to overflow. It’s pretty standard for me to draw 3 or more destiny with him between fett, crossfire and I have you now. Choke vader is good against scrubs. I want a mix because I don’t want Grimtaash to screw me out of hand vaders.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My light deck is my own creation. I owe some credit to the design to KToD because my original thought process when creating my senate was to look at all the good senate decks on decktech and go from there. I could not find any good senate decks posted (at the time Chris Menzel had not posted his senate), so I figured, well why not work with the best senate ever even if it is on the opposite side. The same general principles apply. So that’s what I did originally but I’ve tweaked it a ton since. Some of the tweaks have come thanks to Chris Menzel’s senate which gave me quite a few ideas.<br/>

So this deck isn’t really that similar to Desai’s. Desai’s is an aggressive beats deck, mine is a slow control deck. We give each other crap because each of us thinks our site is the better one (forest vs 3/2) but in the end it just comes down to the style of the decks. I think I may have been the only one in the entire tournament more confident with my light than my dark.<br/>
<br/>
So day 2 begins and I am paired with Chris Menzel first game. I had met Chris the day before and he was a really cool guy so I was excited to have the chance to play him.<br/>
<br/>
My LS Senate vs Chris Menzel’s ROPs<br/>
He starts arrest order, imp justice v and insignificant rebellion v. I always start Squassin, Wokling v, and Strike Planning. I get a good hand, light on senators but with 2 EPPs. I get either Luke or his ship in my starting hand (don’t remember), so if I get 8 force total I can get Luke to ralltir first turn. He doesn’t do much his first turn, and his second turn he flips with a few scrubs. EPP qui beats on one scrub but he has the react-from-hand at-st so the site clears. Next turn he re-scrubs his sites and gets baron and POTF to ralltirr, my luke is at endor. I get Mace and Leia down to two sites, both of which I clear. He reflips though with 2 more sites and scrubs at each site. He clears Leia and moves away from mace.<br/>
<br/>
One of the sites he played was the forest so I drop 2 cards from his hand, convert forest and beat with obi, I got his Ghhhk with my objective. From there I had 2 sites securely in my control and once I took his system it was good game. FW +25<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 I originally am paired up with Lee Edwards, but the pairing are a little off so instead I face Greg Shaw. Either way I’m playing HD against light senate.<br/>
<br/>
I started Conduct your search, AAAv, and I think No Escape. He started Strike planning, wokling v, and I’m not sure what else. Anyways, first turn Back door, emperor. Second turn drain, vader. Third turn drain, fett. Fourth turn he has the drain canceller but I get Bane Malar and Emperor’s power out. I fortressed hardcore at the back door because I had maul, maul strikes, and mara in my hand. He lost the 3/2 site off the top early and that was it for his ground. I had a huge edge on damage. He eventually got Home One and some fish to endor and I answered with maul and his ship but somehow my SWCCG brain misfired and I forgot to cloak. I didn’t take any overflow, but still. Anyways, it didn’t really matter because the 5 damage per turn cycle he was taking was just too much. FW+20<br/>
4 (+45)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 I face Angelo Consoli, who I had played yesterday and who is a superb player and a former world champ. He’s also a great guy and I talked with him a lot this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
My HD vs Angelo Consoli’s QMC<br/>
He starts Beldon’s Eye v, KTEOF, and something else I can’t recall. Anyways, he didn’t give away what kind of deck he was playing so I guessed it was standard old school European QMC. First turn I had emperor in hand and no vaders in hand or force pile. So I just played the Emperor to the force pile. He grabbed the 1/0 site and just set up his hand. At this point he lost the drain-canceller site off the top to visage so that really hurt him. If I had another immunity main in my hand I would have gone down to CC to try and lock out his flip but I didn’t. So I went for the back door and used blizzard 4 to get out vader. Usually I like to be aggressive with vader but I figured he probably wouldn’t want to go off-planet where his tricks wouldn’t work so that was a safe drain of 2.<br/>
<br/>
 He flipped one turn with a few guys, moving everyone to the 1/0 site. He had luke and dash in space and I never went to space all game. His next turn he beefed up his west gallery really hard (including obi there) and went with corran to cancel visage. He pathed away and I chased. So he’s draining for 3, I’m draining for 3, but I’m paying 6 to do it and he retrieves 1. I have the edge in terms of early damage though. Anyways I beat corran with Bane and fett, he houjixes. I send Fett used. Visage back out but he cancels with OOC/TT. At some point I get mara and dr.e to the 1/0 site so I’m draining 5 to his 3 and I’m winning the race. We do a few things at the end but I finish out a close win.<br/>
FW +11<br/>
6 (+56)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 I play Justin Desai. This is the one matchup I definitely did not want to face going into the tournament. I’m confident that I can beat just about any deck other than this one, Justin Desai’s dark senate.<br/>
<br/>
My LS Senate vs Justin Desai’s DS Senate<br/>
He starts Decree v, the senate forfeit booster, and crossfire v. So this game starts with a war over the senate which was long and boring and I won’t bother telling you about. He won eventually as I just could not keep up with his curve. And no, civil disorder v would not have changed that as we’ve playtested that too. Ok, I lied, I will tell you about one thing. When I flipped I looked for my political effects, and my subtract 3, my add 3, and endor were all in my force pile. I mean, if it wasn’t already gg that’s gg there. He dropped baron to naboo and I saw a chance. If I could drop an uberfalcon on him, he couldn’t get away. Problem was it took me a few turns to get everything perfect. Han, Chewie, Princess Leia, Lando Scoundrel in Falcon. Power 10, Maneuver 8, 4 battle destinies. I got a justice agenda on plea so he would have to draw back to back 6s to hit falcon and moved it over. Oh yeah and savrip. BAM what are you going to do now Justin Desai? You can’t move away from the uberfalcon. He drops Bossk v in Hounds Tooth v, limiting me to one battle destiny. BLOWN OUT! He does some things but none of them include losing bossk so I lose, something like FL -22.<br/>
6 (+34)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 I’m paired with Joe Olson. This is one of only two games on day 2 where I am not in the top 2 pairings, the other being the game immediately after this one.<br/>
<br/>
My HD vs Joe Olson’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
He starts Wokling v, SquadAss, and something else. I start Conduct your search, crush the rebellion and crossfire v. First turn choke Vader to cantina. Second turn Emperor and his power. He gets first turn outrider to tat second turn Chewie and luke in chewie’s at-st to db 94. I drop blizz 4, miss pulling mara, move vader over to back it up. He knows I have I have you now and crossfire giving me 4 destiny vs luke. He makes such a great play this next turn that I’m just floored. He plays Epp Han landed in the falcon to the DB (so I can’t choke), then plays the AO limiting me to one battle destiny on the ground where he occupies the related system. Then he battles, plays don’t get goldenrody from his lost pile and draws 5 battle destiny to my one. Luckily when the smoke clears I have 20 to his 31 so I forfeit vader and blizzard 4 and he forfeits han.<br/>
<br/>
Now I really have to think about this. As long as that AO is in effect, I won’t be able to win the docking bay and kill luke. It’s not easy to compete with WYS in space, but I have seen him topdeck 3 ships to visage already. I decide my best option is to go to space with Zuckuss + 4-LOM and I draw high enough to kill dash and his ship. He now has to All wings for r2 in r5 and put mirax aboard to kessel. Unfortunately I don’’t have a maul’s ship in hand. He also puts forfeit fodder all over the place at the db so I can’t clear it with just 4 battle destinies. But now I’m draining for free which is nice and I can get a pretty decent drop on the docking bay. I drop blizzard 4 and get vader, put maul down basically as forfeit fodder. He doesn’t do much on his turn so my next turn I drop bane and fett, battle. He fallen portals vader. I have you now, crossfire. 6 destiny to 2 destiny. When the battle ends all he has remaining is karrde in the falcon. Luke is gone and I’m flipped and that is huge because visage is destroying both of us. He gets the x-wing laser cannon on r2 in r5 and chases zuckuss for the remainder of game but my ground drains, visage, and emperor’s power let me win a close one in the end.<br/>
FW +6<br/>
8(+40)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 I am to play Kevin Shannon’s dark senate clouds deck. His deck is really interesting in that he tries to get I’m sorry v working on naboo for a ton of damage with baskol. Unfortunately his worst matchup is ls senate and apparently he faced it multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
My LS Senate vs Kevin Shannon’s DS Senate<br/>
He starts off going not to the senate, but to clouds around naboo. He does this for the first couple turns while I get my hand set and my senators out. He goes to the clouds with tie interceptors shooting their guns, threatening to blow me out of the sky when I come down on them. He does some damage but not a lot and I quickly get Mace + Saber to the naboo db and obi to the forest I played to endor. I get off drains of 4 and 3 before he sets up a third cloud sector and resistance. After a while he comes down with senators of his own but neither of us initiates. Eventually there was a point where he would take majority if I did not battle him and I did not want to take baskol damage so I did. The same turn I tried to take him out of a cloud sector with a gun of my own but he barriered and shot me down on his turn. Turn after I get outrider to naboo, r2 in r5 to endor. I’m draining all over the place now and he’s not really doing too much in the way of damage. He moves the armed interceptor in front of outrider. I get corran/rs7 and falcon/captain han to naboo and the resulting overflow ends the game.<br/>
FW +22<br/>
10(+62)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’m sitting at 5-1 right now and all the 6-2s are going to make it. All I need is to win one of my final two games. <br/>
<br/>
Game 7 I face Mike Gemme. We know this about ten minutes before pairings are called and I’m just hoping I’m playing dark because he’s playing the same dark as Justin is. I am playing dark and I breathe a sigh of relief. Well, as close to that as I can with my nose completely stuffed up as it was all weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Caution: Way too much detail in this game.<br/>
<br/>
My HD vs Mike Gemme’s WYS<br/>
I start Conduct your search, crush the rebellion and crossfire v. He started Squadron Assignments, Rycar v, and Wokling v. My first turn I think I just draw. He gets luke out to tatooine with IWYT and I answer with maul in his ship holding I have you now but he hyper escapes to the rendezvous point. His turn he deploys dash with luke and moves them both to kessel. I put vader to the cantina so he can’t drain and I’ve got a free drain of 4 going not to mention visage. He gets uncontrollable fury out on vader and it’s huge. He probably did 20+ damage to me with this card throughout the course of the game. Anyways he cancelled visage right before uncontrollable fury hit and I had already topdecked my other visage so that was it for visage this game. Then he played a few scrubs to the db and I didn’t have a whole lot in my hand so I just moved vader over. Obviously he didn’t want to kill vader so he just moved the group to the cantina but also dropped falcon on my maul. See I had not been cloaking because I figured it would be better to take what he could dish out when he did rather than lose 2 every turn. This was mostly because I’d seen him topdeck a ship and he had 2 on the table already. Anyways I lost maul and he lost chewie. He moved luke over to tatooine so dash could drain at kessel. <br/>
<br/>
I then drop Zuckuss and 4-LOM on dash and kill the outrider. The turn after that I drop EPP maul and dr.e on his dudes in the cantina. Operate on two and overflow the other. I don’t even sac crossfire because I figure that if he doesn’t have houjix that’s game. A mistake as he it could be worses all but like 4 of the damage. I lose more to uncontrollable fury again. A turn or two later I kill the falcon with fett and crossfire v but don’t overflow b/c I forgot about captain han’s game text (two mistakes in one game). Some weird thing went on the turn before and gemme doesn’t know what I’m talking about and I don’t know what he’s talking about and Eier asks if “wisemarsellus Wallace is getting blown out”. Anyways, from what I’ve said before it seems like I’m firing on all cylinders and it certainly felt like it in the game. But WYS did what it always does and somehow stays in games forever. I think they let you play 70 cards in that deck or something. Anyways he plays X-Wing laser cannons and now he gets to chase zuckuss around.<br/>
<br/>
So here’s the situation. I have more cards than he does by a decent amount. But the only damage I’m able to cause is my cantina drain of 2 because the db is projectioned. He’s doing 2 damage with uncontrollable fury and retrieving 1 with luke. Even though he’s outdamaging me I’ve got the lead on him and I look like I have this. Just to be sure though I drop Emperor and Emperor’s Power v. Unfortunately I’m shield busted so I can’t get coward out. He gets like melas to the empty falcon but I’m confused as to why because zuckuss always blocks his drain. Then he gets chewie to the db and flips. On the edge from lost pile, say 5. That 5 retrieval is game-changing. He battles with chewie and I draw a 2 meaning he doesn’t even have to lose overflow. We get down to a drain race and I drain him down to 1 card before uncontrollable fury finishes me off. It was a fantastic game, close down to the wire. FL -1<br/>
10 (+61)<br/>
<br/>
Now you might ask why I didn’t just put Vader in Blizzard 4 and let it go OOP. Well, he had luke going, so if I lost vader he could just retrieve Uncontrollable fury and get it back to his hand with Rycar next turn. I could conceivably just not redeploy vader but then he’s draining me for 3 at kessel. I couldn’t block the drain with zuckuss for fear of the laser cannons (before he deployed them) and if I block the drain with a cloaked maul I’m back where I started. What I probably should have done was deploy maul to his ship rather than the cantina and I have you now + crossfire should have cleared luke. Then he would not have satisfied uncontrollable fury. At the time though, the beat on the cantina seemed like the better play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My final pairing is against Mike Gemme again. Since I’m 5-2 and he’s 6-1 I assume I’ve got the highest diff among the 5-2s or maybe the next highest. Either way I intend to try and make the game as close as possible. He’s playing the same DS senate as Justin and I think he’ll win but I figure the longer I make him battle me in the senate and lose force to decree the better the chance I will have of winning.<br/>
<br/>
My LS Senate vs Mike Gemme’s DS Senate<br/>
I get a very good opening hand for the mirror match. Gemme and I had the most epic fight ever over the senate. He had poor luck with his draws and I had good luck with mine which put us even since his deck is naturally favored. We literally battled at the senate for the first 15 turns or so of the game. I think we both went through just about every senator in our deck and by the time we were done we were both low on cards but I had the senate. It was funny because we were playing at one point with both of our 7 sides up but neither of us meeting the flip conditions and desai was like, are you both cheating? and we’re like no we just screwed up the side the card is on. Then I remember I had dropped two cards from mike’s hand that turn and was like, um, no I’m cheating my bad. It was the end of a very long day of swccg and I had mothma and amidala at the senate and I guess I just thought, oh 2 characters at the senate I’m flipped. Well we just took that back so it was ok. Anyways after securing the senate I went for a forest drain and an endor drain. It was cool but then mike went for me in the senate again and we had even more fighting there but he just didn’t have the senators to cancel my drains any more so I etched out a win by 5. FW +5<br/>
12(+62)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I end up going 6-2 in my first ever world’s which is good enough for 5th place. I went 3-1 with both my light and dark decks. I know I surprised a lot of people because most people don’t know who I am but I can assure you this was not a fluke. I think I am only out of place by reputation, not by skill. Anyways, the top 8 broke down as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1) Jonny Chu<br/>
2) Justin Desai<br/>
3) Brian Hunter<br/>
4) Mike Gemme<br/>
5) Tom Hollingworth (me)<br/>
6) Brian Fred<br/>
7) Angelo Consoli<br/>
8) Brad Eier<br/>
<br/>
So I play Mike Gemme first off. I talk with Pistone about what I should do and he tells me to come over to his hotel room later and we’ll playtest and such. Nice. But first Mark and I have to give mryellow, deck104, allstarz97, and terron a ride back to their hotel. Why did I just use screen names there? Idk either. So it was funny because as we were about to leave from the store Mike comes up to me and goes something like, “I hope you can’t sleep at all tonight and when you do you have nightmares, you lose all of your decks, you get even sicker, you can’t find the card shop tomorrow, and I’ll see you in the parking lot in 5 minutes so you can give me a ride back to the hotel”. I started cracking up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways we stopped at TGIF and when we got there Gemme wanted to drink his beer from the wicked cool SWCCG steins KToD got for winning the team tourney. So he makes the waitress wait while he gets the stein from the car, and she’s like, now I’ve got to wait for him to go get his faggotyass beermug. And then he comes back and she picks it up and the weirdest thing happens. She like reads Star Wars and goes crazy, does a complete 180. She’s literally melting because he has a star wars cup and she’s like how did you get this. So he tells her about how he won a star wars card tournament and so on and she’s like hanging on his every word. He eventually gets the digits and hangs out with her and stuff and the moral of the story is that Mike Gemme has mad game. He must watch the Pickup Artist or something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We thought that the light side decks to watch out for were definitely light senate and light combat. We agreed that hunt down would be a good choice. We agreed on a couple of card changes to tech it out more for the combat/senate matchups. The plan was to remove Bane Malar v for Hyperwave Scan v and remove Emperor’s Power v for Stop Motion v. Problem was I couldn’t find a Hyperwave scan before day 2 so what I ended up doing was Stop Motion for Bane. As far as light side goes I was either going to play LSC or my light senate but with Scrambled Transmission v. We figured that Mike would probably play either senate or hunt down, leaning towards senate. That settled it in my mind, I wanted to play combat. I didn’t actually have the cards for combat though, so Pistone allowed me to borrow his combat deck. I looked it through and it was a really great deck. We tested a game of hunt down vs combat and Pistone gave me all kinds of tips on how to play the matchup. After that we called it a night and I went to bed at 4:30 without even playtesting my light deck.<br/>
<br/>
Day 3 rolls around and after Henry checks the decks we get under way. Mike elects to play dark first.<br/>
<br/>
My LSC vs Mike Gemme’s DS Senate<br/>
He starts naboo and I can’t recall the effects. I start Evacuation Control v, Quick Draw v, and my sleep-deprived brain forgets about Scrambled Transmission v so I start Rycar v. I got luke down real early and drained for a while. As soon as I actually start playing I become fully awake and aware. He set up the senate and ability x3. I never cancelled it and probably lost about 8-10 force to it over the course of the game. He came down to the ground once but I dodged to reduce his lightsaber swings and used evac control. I got padme going with luke and leia over the course of a few turns. It was really a drain race, he was doing 6 damage I was doing 6 damage. Near the end he started to do more because AAA started working. I got HCF to kessel when he was low on cards so he had to chase me around in space. In the end I win the race, FW +9<br/>
<br/>
We take a five minute break and then are back at it.<br/>
<br/>
My HD vs Mike Gemme’s LSC<br/>
He started Evacuation Control v, Quick Draw v, and I think Wokling v. I started Conduct your search, ability x3 v, and first strike. I get nothing really in my opening hand but on my reserve deck search I notice my force pile is amazing. I have 2 mauls, phantom menace, stop motion in there that I noticed. So I drew for them. He played yoda either his first or second turn and I dropped maul and phantom menace. Maul stuck around thanks to a force field and moved to the 3/2 site. He could not get rid of maul right away so I stuck around and kept the pressure going at the 3/2 site. Neither of us was on the desired side of our objective for just about the entire game, but I was getting drains in and he wasn’t. We cleared each other off of naboo a few times and he just ran out of jedi before I did. He must have topdecked around 6 jedi and he just couldn’t keep up with the pace my jedi were coming out. I ended up winning by around 20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have to wait for the other games to finish. In the end, Chu beats Eier, Desai beats Angelo, and Fred beats Hunter. So I play Chu and Desai plays Fred. Chu elects to play dark first.<br/>
<br/>
This was probably the most intense game I played all weekend.<br/>
My LSC vs Jonny Chu’s AOBS<br/>
He starts Info Exchange v, Scum, and Jabba’s influence v. I play Wokling v, Rycar v and Quick Draw v. My plan is to get Entrenchment and a super-jedi luke down to the 3/2 site and that’s just what I do. Jedi Luke with Bionic Hand and I’m with you too. I figure I’ve got a good chance if I can keep him on the 0 side all game. I think it takes him a couple of turns to react to this and I try and get some of the cards I want but they’re not coming. After a couple of turns he plays Emperor and a couple scrubs over to the 2/2 site, flipping me. I tunnel vision hoping to find a dodge. I can’t so I take Qui-gon. I drop him but he overloads the saber. He uses broken concentration so I can’t move qui-gon away. I combat emperor away. He comes back with some dudes including a boba fett, BH from used pile for free with twi’ilek v., battles quigon, retrieves the emperor and puts like 8 overflow on me which I lose rather than forfeit quigon. After the battle he now has jodo 4-LOM and greedo maybe at the site. Finger 4-LOM and drop obi. Obi gets the saber. I battle and hit jodo. Then he hidden weapons obi, draws a 6. obi is lost and it goes from me overflowing him for a bunch to hoping I draw better destiny than he does so I don’t lose force. I do and I clear the site but obviously that hidden weapons screwed me. I move over to join luke.<br/>
<br/>
I think he comes down with the emperor and a couple other guys again. I again move qui-gon over and combat the emperor away and had my only mistrack of the tournament. I drew a 6/2 for combat and he also drew a 6/2. He added 1 and I forgot to add 1 with quigons saber b/c I was thrown off by seeing the HCF pop up at me for destiny. Now my inability to clear the emperor was brutal. I couldn’t move luke over because he would just track the 6 and shock him (Lando to +1). So Qui-gon had to take the full force of the attack. It was harsh and I had to lose qui-gon with overflow. My next turn I was forced to move luke over to combat and this time I did clear with a 6/7. Now that he didn’t have the protection of entrenchment chu could go nuts but I had disarmed both IG and Bossk so I was in a slightly better place. But then he was able to get capture fett out with twi’ilek v and captured him with that tracked 6. That was game so I drew up before he could put me in a broken concentration lock. He did manage to get all but two cards from his hand into life force though. FL -21<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I needed to win by 22 in order to advance. Chu was playing the same light senate as desai so it was very unlikely that I could win by so much. I concluded that the only way I could realistically win by so much is if Chu has absolutely atrocious luck. I resolved to play assuming that he had because I knew that it was the only way I could win the match. For this reason I did not play as I normally would have and since Chu didn’t have atrocious luck, I got destroyed. By how I normally would have played I mean that normally I would have gotten the bridge with we wish to board at once instead of trying for emperor’s power and holding off deploying vader until I could fortress him. That’s not quite what I did. Even if I had followed the game plan I might not have won, but I certainly would not have won by 22.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My HD vs Jonny Chu’s LS Senate<br/>
As per my game plan I tried to get Emperor, Vader, and Emperor’s Power to the back door early regardless of whether or not I had the tools to protect them. I did not and Chu repeatedly cleared me with EPP strikes. This was the most one-sided game I played all weekend and Chu just crushed me. I scooped once I got too low.<br/>
<br/>
Jonny Chu then went on to defeat Justin Desai 2-0 in the championship match. Congratulation Jonny Chu, the first ever 2 time world champion! You are the best player in the world right now and I feel no shame in losing to such a great.<br/>
