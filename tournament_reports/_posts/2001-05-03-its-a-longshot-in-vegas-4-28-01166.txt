<blockquote><font class="bfont"> All week I was hyped for the DPC in Vegas.  I had all these deck<br>
ideas to try out and play, because I was planning on staying with<br>
several guys from my Southern CA squad, so I could see what worked.<br>
Unfortunately, this is final exam time for me, so I ended up not<br>
touching my SW cards all week, and just went with decks I already<br>
had made.  I was driving down to Vegas from San Francisco with <br>
Clayton Atkin, Ohmy Fasudhani, and Alfred Dong, all of whom are in<br>
the top 10 in Alderaan so all of them have the skills to win the<br>
DPC.  The champs in the car talked a bunch of tech.  Mapquest told<br>
us it was a 11.5 hr drive, but we trimmed that down to 8.5 hours.<br>
I didn’t have a chance to tweak or build decks because I was (&amp;<br>
still am) in final exams so I didn’t get to do ANYTHING I wanted<br>
to do regarding SWCCG.<br>
<br>
Clayton went with his CCT skrillings odds deck which won him the<br>
CA championship and several other tournies.  He chose his killer<br>
TIGIH scouts for LS.  Ohmy used Klatooinian Revolutionaries AITC<br>
(a.k.a. the Vietcong deck).  It had gone 2-0 at the Vegas prelim,<br>
both wins against MKOS.  Those Revolutionaries are power 5 at JP<br>
sites!  You can really swarm with them.  For dark, he chose MKOS<br>
skrillings.  Alfred used MKOS skrillings and TIGIH scouts.  I<br>
played a little against my friends from So Cal, and we invited the<br>
Northern CA guys to stay with us, but they decided to get their<br>
own room since it was a bit crowded.  I had 2 decks to choose<br>
from.  Hunt Down w/unique TIEs, or Court Scum.  I chose Hunt Down<br>
because I felt it had the better chance against WYS decks.  For<br>
light I had a HB mains deck and EBOX, and the EBOX did waaaaay<br>
better in my playtesting so EBOX it was.  I changed a couple cards<br>
because I had done horribly in the prelim on Friday, but mainly<br>
chalked it up to game mistakes in my part, not the deck.<br>
<br>
So we wake up, and head on out to the 2nd ever DPC.  Fill out the<br/>
decklist, pay the entry fee, and prepare to play 8 games without<br/>
any breaks.  Good thing I brought some food with me.  72 people I<br/>
heard showed up.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v Bryan Nakamuya’s Endor Ops (from San Diego area)<br/>
<br/>
I’ve been to San Diego, but I never met Bryan.  He does the Op As<br/>
Planned start to get Desperate Counter and his DSII stuff.  I start<br/>
ANSB.  It was a funny game.  He didn’t want to deploy systems for<br/>
me to drain at, and I didn’t want to deploy systems for him to move<br/>
the DSII to.  So once EBO got setup, I deployed to Endor &amp; we <br/>
battle there all game long.  He keeps some ships at the DSII so if<br/>
I move over he can battle them and kill them.  I don’t worry about<br/>
blowing it away, its not hurting me anyway.  I am draining at his <br/>
Endor DB with my Rogue 2 and at the North Ridge with Rogue 3, <br/>
both with pilots aboard and Bacta Tank out.  He apparantly only<br/>
has EPP Vader as a ground troop, who is in the bunker with Jejerrod.<br/>
So the game takes a long time, neither of us can beat the other off<br/>
of Endor, and my measly drains on the ground do him in.  Win by<br/>
18.  2 (+18).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Good fights in space, my Org Attacks saved me from losing<br/>
many xwings.  We would often tie on power and both be immune to<br/>
attrition (he had Star Destroyers with the Order out which protects<br/>
them).<br/>
Worst: Maybe I should have deployed more systems, but I had never<br/>
faced this deck before and didn’t know what to expect.  I would<br/>
have been losing to the DSII though had I deployed a system.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Casey Barson’s WYS (from Utah)<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who read my TR from the prelim in Vegas, this is <br/>
the same guy from that tourney.  I figure he’s playing the one-<br/>
battle-and-its-game-over card, so I watch how I deploy.  DLOTS<br/>
hits Tat DB 1st turn, while he deploys Home One DB and draws.<br/>
BTW, I start IAO, Mob Pts, and Combat Response.  Emperor goes to<br/>
my Endor DB, and I drop Endor and Kashyyk.  Baron in Saber 1 w/<br/>
cannon goes to Endor.  He deploys a &lt;&gt; DB with Lando w/gun.<br/>
Then EPP Han goes to the Cantina to flip.  Emp moves to Tat DB,<br/>
Vader moves to Han.  I deploy a couple TIEs to Kashyyk.  He drops<br/>
a couple smugglers on Emp, but I draw a 6 and he draws low so I<br/>
don’t lose anything.  Then Han moves to Emp’s site.  So I know<br/>
the Emp will need backup, but I forget that I’m setting myself<br/>
up for the one-battle-and-its-game-over card and I move Vader<br/>
over.  So EPP Luke goes to the Cantina, he battles and plays the<br/>
bad feeling card, Run, Luke, Run, then Clashes Vader.  He then<br/>
hits Emp and I lose a bunch of force to end the game.  I guess<br/>
Casey’s just got my number with those battle cards.  Lose by 25.<br/>
2 (-7).<br/>
<br/>
Best: I had good drains going, I just couldn’t deal with the <br/>
clash of sabers.<br/>
Worst: Problem was I couldn’t do much else other than move Vader.<br/>
He only had power 5 there, so I would’ve had to leave Emp alone<br/>
to prevent that card from being played.  And I figured DLOTS could<br/>
do some chokin’.  Oh well.......<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Simon Lee’s Endor Ops (from Canada)<br/>
<br/>
Simon does the Op As Planned start to get Desperate Counter.  I<br/>
start ANSB.  I get a good hand and decide to deploy my systems<br/>
thsi time.  I spread my xwings out &amp; get in some good drains after<br/>
EBO is setup.  He moves the DSII to do damage to me, but I deploy<br/>
Honor to stop it for now.  Things are looking good for me since he<br/>
keeps several of his ships at the DSII to stop me from moving there<br/>
and blowing it away.  He’s got a large fleet at Hoth (Guri &amp; Xizor<br/>
in their ships, DSSD, and 2 TIEs w/guns), so i drop an xwing there<br/>
with a claw to kill that drain.  So his drain is dead, &amp; his DSII<br/>
damage is dead thanks to Honor.  However, he moves his fleet to a<br/>
system where I have 2 xwings, so I run away, and he Gravity Shadows<br/>
one of them.  Uh-oh.  I only have enough force left to move 2 xwings<br/>
to help it out, so i do that and save 1 force.  He battles, I react<br/>
w/Spiral and play Org Attack, but I still take quite a bit of damage<br/>
thanks to his 3 destiny draws (Guri &amp; Xizor).  Something like 14<br/>
overflow.  Then he moves his fleet around and shoots down my xwings<br/>
with those TIEs that shoot during his move phase.  My drains dwindled<br/>
&amp; he occupied his 3 BGs to satisfy Honor and the DSII started hurting<br/>
me.  Lose by 8.  2 (-15).<br/>
<br/>
Best: I played well, he just got me with the Gravity Shadow.<br/>
Worst: Were it not for the Gravity Shadow I easily would have won.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Steve Marshall’s Profit (from Arizona)<br/>
<br/>
I’d seen Steve’s name all over decktech before so its was cool to<br/>
finally meet him.  I started Mara in the Chamber.  Emperor went to<br/>
my Endor DB, and the next turn Lord Vader went to his Tatooine DB.<br/>
He still hadn’t deployed anyone, so I moved Mara w/saber out to JP<br/>
and drew, and then twi’leked for Secret Plans.  But he went and freed<br/>
Han before I could deploy the Plans and retrieved his force.  Ben<br/>
w/saber did the freeing of Han.  I’ve got my space drains at Endor<br/>
and Kashyyk so I leave Ben and Han alone.  He deploys a &lt;&gt; DB and <br/>
Mara moves there so I can activate more (I wanted to deploy Executor<br/>
next turn).  Then I realize he doesn’t have much space power, so I<br/>
don’t deploy anymore in space.  He drops Boushh and Master Luke vs<br/>
Lord Vader, Boushh has Ani’s saber.  He battles, I consider dueling<br/>
Luke, but even though he has no stick I don’t feel confident enough.<br/>
So Vader and Boushh die, and I deploy DLOTS to Luke’s site.  Steve’s<br/>
got 1 card in hand, and 10 in his life force (I’ve got 18 or so and <br/>
a few in hand), but I don’t duel.  I don’t battle either, I decide<br/>
to let the drains decide who will win.  He activates down to one, &amp;<br/>
since I’m a nice guy I say "You sure you want to do that?"  He<br/>
decides to leave 3 in reserve.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So now I think he’s got Courage in hand, and I just let the drains<br/>
finish him off.  He’s only draining me in the Chamber with Ben w/<br/>
saber and Han in there.  So I win by 12.  And yes, he was holding<br/>
Courage in hand (so I don’t know why he’d activate down to one if he<br/>
had it in hand).  4 (-3).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Space drains were the difference in the game.<br/>
Worst: Turns out he had the Courage outta the gate 1st turn.<br/>
<br/>
Several people are dropping throughout the tourney, but that is to<br/>
be expected.  I’m 2-2 as are many of my buddies, but one of my pals<br/>
from So Cal (Dan Lujan) is 4-0 and is rolling, so that’s cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v Caleb Smith’s BHBM (from San Diego)<br/>
<br/>
I played Caleb once when I was in SD, and he beat me with the Super<br/>
Falcon (damn Legendary Starfighter hit me all game).  I figured my<br/>
EBO could win here.  I started ANSB.  He gets Emp and Janus to DSII<br/>
DB 1st turn, I get my EBO stuff.  Then Vader hits the Endor DB, and<br/>
I deploy Hoth Luke to the North Ridge, saving 2 force.  He just <br/>
draws, and I move Luke under the shield, and setup EBO.  I lose to<br/>
Your Destiny (even though he had already activated), and I drop an<br/>
xwing at Kiffex and Hoth, with 2 barriers and Hyper Escape in hand.<br/>
However, he drops 4 Dreadnaughts at Kiffex (and like an idiot I <br/>
barrier BOTH of them, leaving me no force to hyper escape away!),<br/>
then Zuckuss in Mist Hunter comes down to totally wreck that poor<br/>
xwing.  I take like 15 in overflow.  That’s because he had his <br/>
destiny tracked and used Emp’s Power to draw 2 7’s.  Jeez, I am <br/>
playing dumb, I should’ve remembered I could’ve Hyper Esacaped away.  <br/>
Well, he had the lock in space now with 4 dreads and Zuckuss, and I<br/>
lost my claw to a drain.  So I moved Luke to Endor DB, and that was<br/>
the only damage he would take all game.  Lose by 34.  4 (-37).<br/>
<br/>
Best: It was over quickly.<br/>
Worst: Should’ve only played 1 barrier.  Being 2-3 is not cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS v Shane Watner’s MWYHL test to 1 (from Vegas)<br/>
<br/>
Cool, the first guy I’ve played from around here.  I talk with him<br/>
a little to ask who the top players are and how the tourney scene is<br/>
around here.  Then we get down to business.  I get SFS and Wakeelmui<br/>
out 1st turn, but no Vader, so i draw and there he is.  Lord Vader<br/>
to my Endor DB 2nd turn, he inserts AFA and draws.  It pops, I lose<br/>
4, and I notice he loses Uncontrollable Fury.  I thank God because I<br/>
only play ONE Lord Vader and I got him 2nd turn!  If I had drawn any<br/>
other Vader that would’ve really stunk.  That’s because he got Yoda <br/>
to his Hut so I’d have been losing 2 force per turn.  Anyway, I get<br/>
my space drains setup with Chirneau in Vader’s TIE and the Dominator<br/>
at Kashyyk and the Executor w/Piett at Endor.  Super Falcon goes to<br/>
Kashyyyk, so I drop Emp’s Sword and then battle, then play Imperial<br/>
Command, which he grabs.  I draw high, and he loses Han and Leia,<br/>
leaving the Falcon empty.  A couple more AFAs are inserted (its the<br/>
only damage being done to me), until he drops EPP Obi and Tawss vs<br/>
Lord Vader and a couple pilots and landed TIEs at the Endor DB.  He<br/>
clashes Vader, and drops OTE and I forfeit a few TIEs.  Then I deploy<br/>
more pilots and TIEs (retrieving some), and I tracked a 6 so I know<br/>
I’ll kill Obi (Tawss is only forfeit 3).  So I kill him, and now its<br/>
just Vader and TAwss at the DB.<br/>
<br/>
My drains are hurting him (he never bothered to complete Test 1) but<br/>
I decide to keep Chirneau on the TIE even though he doesn’t add to <br/>
drains because I was afraid he’d get Han and Leia on the Falcon again,<br/>
and I needed all the power I could get.  So Vader finishes off Tawss<br/>
once he’s unclashed and I drain Shane out for the win by 18.  6 (-19).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Taking down the Super Falcon and getting Lord Vader out.<br/>
Worst: I lost to AFA 4 times!  16 force right there.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: LS v Brian Choorgphol’s TDIGWATT (from Arizona)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I’m 3-3 and hoping to finish 2-0.  I start ANSB and get a good<br/>
hand with Wedge, RSL and a couple Rogue speeders.  So when he puts<br/>
Lord Vader w/saber at a CC site, I immeditaely drop Wedge and Hobbie<br/>
and kill Vader, while cancelling his destiny.  That also cancelled<br/>
Search &amp; Destroy since he had Dengar w/gun and Mara at the other CC<br/>
site.  Turns out he wasn’t playing DD, just CC Occupation with <br/>
unique TIEs (like my dark deck).  So I setup EBO and spread out my<br/>
xwings to drain.  He keeps looking for matching pilots but they’re<br/>
never there.  He finally gets DS-181-3 in Saber 3 to Bespin but I<br/>
deploy the Spiral and shuttle up Wedge &amp; Hobbie in Rogue 3.  He<br/>
doesn’t back up Saber 3, so I battle him and clear him from Bespin.<br/>
Then I shuttle Rogue 3 back down and transit Rogue 1 w/Luke &amp; Zev<br/>
over to the CC DB (only 2 CC sites on table).  He’s looking for <br/>
somewhere to drain, so he drops Emp to the North Ridge.  I Ice Storm<br/>
and now he has nowhere to go that I don’t already occupy.  I guess<br/>
he couldn’t draw the ships to take out my xwings (I had Hyper Escapes<br/>
and Barriers anyways).  Win by 27.  8 (+8).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Deck worked great, if he hadn’t kept on activating all his<br/>
pilots it might have been a better game, but I’ll take the win.<br/>
Worst: None, really, except we didn’t get to battle much.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: DS v Matt Riecks’ WYS<br/>
<br/>
I either forgot to ask where Matt was from, or I can’t remember.  I<br/>
was hoping to win so I’d be 5-3, but at least I was guaranteed to go<br/>
4-4.  Lord Vader goes to my Endor DB, transits to Tat DB 1st turn.<br/>
He draws some.  Emperor goes to Endor DB, and he deploys an RFC and<br/>
Palace Raider in Patrol Craft to his &lt;&gt; DB.  I deploy Vader’s saber<br/>
then drop the Dominator and Saber 1 w/Fel to Tatooine.  I deploy my<br/>
Admirals’ Order Fighters Coming In and Sullust.  He drops Outrider<br/>
w/Dash, and Captain Han aboard the Falcon.  He battles, I react<br/>
with Saber 4 w/pilot for free, and pay 5 to react Onix 2 w/pilot.<br/>
I draw horribly and lose Saber 4 and pilot.  He loses Han.  I move<br/>
over to Sullust.  He deploys Tat Celebration and moves the Falcon,<br/>
with a claw, to Sullust.  Then he attaches.  I deploy Chirneau, &amp;<br/>
he Noble Sac’s Wedge to retrieve 10 force (Insurrection on table).<br/>
<br/>
So I have measly drains of 1 at endor DB and 2 at Tat DB, so I move<br/>
Vader to Cantina.  Jedi Luke w/saber comes down, Weapon Lev’s Vader’s<br/>
stick and I lose Vader and a couple.  Now I’m in REAL trouble, only<br/>
draining at Endor DB and being unable to deploy my EPP Vader in hand.<br/>
I look for another Vader, and find DLOTS, and time is winding down.<br/>
I move back to Tatooine from Sullust, the Falcon detaches (only <br/>
Melas is aboard).  I had left Saber 1 at Sullust.  I’ve got Dominator<br/>
and Saber 2 w/pilot, plus Piett and Chirneau aboard Dominator.  I use<br/>
my imperial Commands to limit his draws and he’s starting to lose<br/>
guys at Tatooine.  However, he’s retrieving w/Celebration &amp; DLOTS<br/>
can’t do much when he keeps his smugglers in Patrol Craft, so DLOTS<br/>
is basically just blocking a drain.  I have 12 cards left when time<br/>
is called.  Matt has 21.  Timed loss by 21.  8 (-13).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Definetely the best game I had played all day.  Matt is a fun<br/>
player.<br/>
Worst: My destiny failed me in this game.  I drew horribly.<br/>
<br/>
Yay!  Its over!  8 games, and I made it through going 4-4.  Not that<br/>
great, especially being in negative diffential, but it was my first<br/>
major tournament ever.  I’d never been to states, regionals, worlds,<br/>
comic con, gencon, and all those.  But this DPC was cool, very fun.<br/>
Lots of good competition, I’ll have to be more ready next time, and <br/>
not worry so much about finals, huh?  :)<br/>
I finish at 8 (-13), good enough for 29th place out of 72.<br/>
<br/>
So the final standings:<br/>
Jon Chu 14 +129<br/>
Kyle Craft 13 +138<br/>
Chris Shaner 12 +107<br/>
Brian Hunter 12 +95<br/>
Jason Kilby<br/>
Arian Delisle<br/>
Tim Guzman<br/>
Paul Feldman<br/>
Ted Hanson<br/>
Caleb Smith<br/>
<br/>
Jon plays his Y4 Throne Room mains v Hunter’s Big Blue ISB and Brain<br/>
takes that match.  Kyle plays his Black Sun deck v Chris’s TIGIH<br/>
w/scouts.  Kyle gets a terrible hand and activates his Coruscant DB.<br/>
With no characters, he decides to deploy Jodo v Jedi Luke, plays<br/>
Hidden Weapons and draws 1, so he loses some force there.  But even<br/>
if he had captured Luke, I didn’t get it cuz he’d lose 2 force to<br/>
I Can Save Him and Chris had a EPP Obi anyway to get Luke back from<br/>
Jodo.  Kyle has Emp and Xizor together, but he splits them up to<br/>
drain for more so Chris Drops Gen Solo, COK, and EPP Obi and rips<br/>
Xizor a new one.  That’s game.<br/>
<br/>
Hunter beat Shaner in both matches and wins the jackpot of $700 (I<br/>
think they decided before the match they would split the money $700<br/>
and $500 rather than $1000 and $200).  Hunter’s space drains with his<br/>
ISB deck were the difference in the game because Hunter had u/c spies<br/>
blocking Shaner’s drains.  Shaner did get a good beating with his <br/>
scouts, but not big enough.  Then, Hunter locked down Shaner’s ISB<br/>
Scum deck with Menace Fades and Battle Plan.  Hunter was draining at<br/>
the CC DB and Tat DB and Corulag, while Shaner drained at JP, the<br/>
Audience Chamber, and Lower Passages.  But he had to pay 3 for each<br/>
drain of 1.  Hunter had Home One and Super Falcon at Corulag, so<br/>
Shaner wasn’t going to mess with that, which was the only BG system.<br/>
Congrats to both of them for doing so well, I hope they didn’t lose<br/>
it all at the casinos.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Dan and i were the only ones from our squad who stuck around<br/>
for the final, so we headed back to the hotel and passed out.  At<br/>
7 AM the next morning I woke up and headed out with the Nor Cal<br/>
squad back to SF.  I slept most of the way.  Thanks for reading,<br/>
I’ll keep the props short since this is long enough.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Mike Girard for running the tourney smoothly &amp; relatively quickly.<br/>
Mike Sinclair and Nathan M. for also running the DPC, good job.<br/>
Everyone I played against, they were all fun games and I feel lucky<br/>
to have met such nice players.<br/>
Alfred for going 4-4 just like me.<br/>
Clayton for doing much of the driving.<br/>
Ohmy for also doing much of the driving.<br/>
Everyone who read this and my prelim TR, and liked them.<br/>
To all those who had a longer drive than we did (530 miles) and<br/>
still made the journey to Vegas.<br/>
To all who placed in the top ten, good job to all them.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
Dan Lujan, for going 5-0, then 0-3.  I was counting on you to go all<br/>
the way man!<br/>
Adam, Chris, Andre, Ohmy, and others for all dropping out of the<br/>
tourney.  I know you were all tired, bored, hungry, sad, whatever,<br/>
but you still should’ve stayed, if only to keep me company.  :)<br/>
Mike Girard for not calling my number on one of the tournament foil<br/>
raffles.  It was rigged I tell ya!<br/>
My school for having final exams at during this time. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
