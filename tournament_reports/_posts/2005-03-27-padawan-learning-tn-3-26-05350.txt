<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Thanks for taking the time to read this. My name is Tom DS1813 Kimsey and this is the last tourney I just played. I committed stuff to memory so this should be a detailed report. (Or at least more detailed than my last.)<br>
<br>
Before the Tourney:<br>
It started at 10:30 so I decide since I need some new sleeves that I would go early. It was held at Outer Limits in Franklin, TN where it is held every third Saturday of the month. We had one last week and decided one was not enough. SO I buy my cool new sleeves and wait for everyone to show up. Danny Pack and Micah Wooten show up at about 10:30 and thats it. So we begin to play fun games. Finally Staggs shows up and we can sanction. Moments later, Danny gets a phone call. Allan Lupinek was on his way but he flipped his car.  Prayers are with him. So we decide to go ahead and play.<br>
<br>
I am playing for dark: A Very very weird CCT.<br>
Light is: Objective-less Credits<br>
<br>
Both decks I have had much practice with so I know them very well and feel quite confident. Here come the match-ups. Micah and Staggs, me and Danny. Very bad.<br>
<br>
Danny has taught me pretty much everything I know. Always pointing out mistakes at the end of games to make me better. But I have never been able to beat him.  The last two out of three tournaments it has come down to me and Danny in the final game and he won. Both times. So this beginning has me worried.<br>
<br>
My CCT versus Danny Packs Throne Room Mains<br>
<br>
He started insurrection &amp; aim high combo, and two other things. I cant remember because they werent that important. They didnt impact the game much. I start You Cannot Hide Combo, Special Delivery [v], and Kuat Yards[v]. I also take a Rebel. He gives me Screamin Lando. First turn he activates. I say cool and pull Executer. I think this cost him the game. He keeps going. When he is done I pitch it for Combat Responses. He then draws a couple. Says go and I get 4 force. I grab They Must Never Again Leave This City and Bespin. Executer goes down free. Naboo also goes down from my hand and I draw the last card. I say go. He activates, throws down more activation and draws. Says go, I get six now. I flash a pilot and find his ship and a weapon. I deploy it to bespin as well. I also get a Lev attack[v] and take Tractor Beam and Shield Generators[v] from under my effect. I throw out Tatooine. Draw a few. Next turn he deploys Home One and a few peeps and Bright Hope to Naboo. He is canceling one destiny and power massive. My total power is 17 and one destiny at Bespin. Couple turns we are pinging each other and he decides not to pay for drains and deploys Coruscant Docking Bay and a whole lot of people. Quiggy w/stick, and Obi w/stick with a few others. He put down a lot. My next turn now that Lando was killed at the prison, and I found Flagship[v], Zuckuss[v], Mist Hunter[v], Lando[v], and U-3PO, I move over to block his drains. I draw. I got Laser Cannon Battery. He has a lot of people on Home One and both Bright Hope and Tantive are empty. He puts a few more peeps down as forfeit fodder. Battles. I react with the cannons. I fire at tantive 4 and hit. I ended up losing a couple of fighters. Missed capturing Bright Hope. My turn. I save force and battle I use three force and fire the gun. Targetting Home One. I draw a six. Total nine and Home One dies. The biggest part of the game. Zuckuss then flies to bespin. Next turn he deploys corran to docking bay and blows U-3Pos cover. Bright hope ran to Bespin. He relizes I will win the drain race if he doesnt go to Naboo to block it. He does, I battle win the game.<br>
<br>
FW 2(+10)<br>
2(+10)<br>
<br>
Good: Shot Home One.<br>
Bad: Couldnt stop paying for drains.<br>
Ugly: Savrip, I hate Savrip.<br>
<br>
Next Game:<br>
My Credits vs. Staggs SYCfA TIE retrieval<br>
<br>
He started Kray Dragon Bones[v], KDY[v], and Mob points. I start Credits will do fine, Sai Toor Kal Fas[v], Civil[v], and Rayc[v]. He pulls Wakellumi or whatever its name is. I use Rayc to pull Lightsaber Pro and Bionic Hand. He deploys a TIE or two plus a few more systems and tells me to go. Tatooine Qui-gon and Twass-Kha[v] come from hand, I find Quiggys stick and deploy both Twas and him to Wattos Junkyard. Light Pro follows. His turn he deploys more systems and drops Arica to the City Outskirts. Says Go. My turn I pully Luke, Rebel Scout from reserve, deploy him, stick, and bionic hand to outskirts. I pull Dont Do That Again shield and grab Advantage. His turn he puts Sidious, and Vader with Stick down with Ponda &amp; Dr. E combo. Battles. He misses Luke I hit Sidious with a 1 and a 7. Im immune to his attrition, he is not and leaves Vader behind. I lost so advantage does not come out. My turn I deploy Tantive 4, Artoo, Broken Droid and Wedge, RSL to Death Star. He broke Aricas cover and I battle Vader and Arica. He misses and I slice Arica easy. Destiny clears sight, Im immune advantage comes out. He loses after three turns of drains. Each turn he lost 13 and a card. 3 at watto plus a card for Credits, 2 at outskirt, 4 at DS, 2 Kessel, 1 at Hologameboard.<br>
<br>
FW 2(+22)<br>
4(+32)<br>
<br>
Good: Having unmolested drains.<br>
Bad: Leaving Spiral By itself for a turn with out him battling it.<br/>
Ugly: A Drain of 4 at the DS that he wouldnt go to even if he had the Executer.<br/>
<br/>
Next Game:<br/>
<br/>
My Credits vs. Dannys Combat Readiness Cloud City.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Weather Vane[v], Alert My Star Destroyer[v], Were the bait[v], and something else. I start same. My opening hand. I got 2x Screaming Lando, 2x Luke, RS, 2x Corran Horn, 2x Han[v]. I got crap. I pull Bionic Hand and lightsaber pro. He grabs executer with Piett and TMNALTC. Goes down for two force, he also throws Blizzard 4, pulls Bewill[v] to his site and says go. I throw luke and Corran down to outskirts like an idiot and not to Junkyard. Firepower [v] came out and he took a card back and said go. He throws Blizzard 2[v] and General Veers[v] to junkyard. I send Obi and his stick and Screamin Lando to the Blizzard 4. Did squat. Bewil died and so did lando. His turn he sent maul w/ stick, Lando[v], and Dr. E. Battles Hits corran, operates. Misses luke, I hit lando. I die, maul stays. Down hill from there. He drains everywhere and kills obi with zuckuss and iggy with riot gun. He drains me out. I couldnt do a single thing against him<br/>
<br/>
FL 0(-29)<br/>
4(+3)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Nothing, this game completely sucked. Everything I did he had a counter.<br/>
Bad: Not going to junkyard first.<br/>
Ugly: Opening had. If he had his evader &amp; Monok he would have wiped me out.<br/>
<br/>
Next and final game:<br/>
<br/>
My CCT vs. Staggs Hidden Swarm<br/>
<br/>
He started Flaps[v] and Rebel Planners[v] and something else unimportant to this matchup. I started same. He gave me Boush. Boush. That was funny. I did my speile and went to Bespin with Exe, Lando and flagship. Said go. He put out a bunch of systems and a Lone X-wing over Kirdo. Commader Luke[v] is on the ground in a speeder during a sandstorm. Lucky SOB. My turn I drop zuckuss, mist hunter, 4-lom w/gun to the lone x-wing. Destiny sucked. A 0 and a 1. His x-wing easily covered it. He puts more systems out and people to Rendevous Point. I put maul w/ stick to Carbonite Chamber and baron and S1 to Corulag. I then move mist hunter to Corulag and Executer to Kashyyyk leaving one person over bespin. He ambushes the lone Bespinite, I ghhhk. He still has not flipped My turn I throw down Bobba, BH in Black 2, Iggy w/riot gun in a left over ship. I battle, he tries to play organized attack but it is canceled due to Black 2. Destiny clears site, Iggy dies and I pay for fett. He goes, decides its time for him to leave, tries to play All wings report in, cant due to Black 2 and then flips. I probe Kashyyyk, no. I then probe Corulag and get it. I drain him out next turn to win.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+21)<br/>
6(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Opening Hand.<br/>
Bad: Him never flipping till end.<br/>
Ugly: Going for a beat down and drawing a 0 and a 1.<br/>
