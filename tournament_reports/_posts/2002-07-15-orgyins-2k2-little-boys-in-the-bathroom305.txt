<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Wow.  Where the f to start? Well&amp;#8230; last time you read one of these, I had just earned my bye into the day-two tournament to be held at Deciphercon by placing second at my regional (Coruscant) by one differential; beating the likes of Chris Terwilliger, Chris Prascak and Johnny Chu.  It’s been some time since then, and you really need to be brought up to speed.<br>
<br>
With my performance at regionals, my rating was boosted to a staggering 2027.  I’ve played in two tournaments since regionals (not including the Origins open), the NYC mini-con, where I went 4-2 and a random Providence tournament where I went 3-3 because I couldn’t play my light deck well.  News spread of the Dantooine regional with 57 attendees, the return of the game was upon us; vicious rumors about Decipher regaining the rights to StarWars again&amp;#8230; crazy @#$% siht my friends&amp;#8230; I don’t know what turn the game will take, I know that it will continue to surge towards the October 31st date of DecipherCon, where 5,000 dollars will be at stake for the greatest CCG that was ever created, and based on what I’ve seen, heard and read&amp;#8230; this game is not dead; its not the same game, but the game itself has not died.  To follow is the story of the game as now, not a game where Canadians sit at the top looking down on the lowly Americans, not a game where you’re not good if you play outside of Southern California, and not a game where the highest rated players are the only contenders to deal with.  The game is in the hands of the ones that care about it.  The story surrounding it? Well that involves corruption, triumph, genius, obsession, and heavy boozing.  And it starts in mid-June with a monumental trip to Boston College, a bar called the tap, and a Russian chick named Olga.<br>
<br>
I have a long work week.  I work forty hours as a pool director at a summer camp, then on Friday, I go from one job to the other, work another 6 hours lifeguarding at a hotel pool.  I get Saturdays off and then I work Sunday at the hotel again before my 40 hour camp week starts again.  One of my best friends from highschool Matt, who goes to school with Justin and has an apartment in his town, is turning 21 so obviously I have to go into the city and celebrate.  Only I have to work until 10, so I get out of work and jet to Boston and meet up with Justin so we can go meet up with my friends from highschool at a bar downtown.  Justin and I head over to his buddies’ house and do some shots and we’re like SHOTS? Because somewhere Justin had the idea that you could get a girl at a bar with simply saying shots.. more on how that failed us later.  <br>
<br>
We take the T downtown and im sitting on the train and frigging this Indian guy with a baby plops down right next to me and im trapped, nowhere to move for about a half hour, totally segregated from Justin and his boys, and they’re laughing at me, so im trying not to laugh wicked hard at 1. the Indian guy with a cute baby that everyone is looking at and noticing how I am trapped, and 2. the red headed chick across the car whose nipple is showing as her breasts completely pop out of her shirt.  Finally we get downtown, I leap over the Indian baby and we head to a bar called The Tap (we were going to go to cheers, but my friend dan’s girlfriend Jackie got her id taken away, and had to buy it back for 100 bucks.. then this bar the purple shamrock didn’t accept mass liquor id’s when my friend sean doesn’t have his liscense so we ended up at the tap) and we just start drinking.  Buying mad beers for everyone, doing lots of shots with my boy matt (one of which was jagr, goldschager and rumplemints) which is the grosses concoction of alcohol ever created.  I love how I just spelled three consecutive boozes completely and utterly incorrect.  Anyways, now to olga.  Olga is this Russian chick&amp;#8230; who is ridiculously hot.  And Justin pointed her out when he got there mentioning how he wanted her, all his friends wanted her, my friend matt told me he wanted her and has been working on her for years&amp;#8230; well I proceded to get extremely shtifaced and start dancing/making out with her on the dance floor for about say 2 hours straight causing a complete spectical of myself&amp;#8230; my friend matt gets pissed, Justin is completely enamored, and all in all I just am totally into frenching an incredibly gorgeous girl with a Russian accent.  She tells me that her roommate is gone for the weekend and that I should go back to her place with her.  Who is mike gemme to refuse a lady.. let alone one that is actually gorgeous.  I go back to her place, we hook up, no latex=no sex (im no matt lush) but we throw hooks and she sleeps naked on top of me for the entire night kissing my body and shti and my hand does not remove itself from her perfect skin, and is centrally focused on the touching of her buttox.  At 330 I cant get ahold of Justin to go back because he as my car key so that I wouldn’t drive but at the same time who knows where he is and I might need to get home in the morning.. still I have to frigging call into work the next day because I was scheduled at two of my jobs (one that I would eventually quit for the camp, but the camp hadn’t started yet so I accidentally scheduled myself at two pools)&amp;#8230; so I go online to get the phone number of the hotel and make a call that goes something like this:<br>
<br>
Night Manager: Hello?<br>
Me: Hi this is mike the morning guard, I cant make it in.. im actually in boston at brigham and women’s hospital getting my stomach pumped&amp;#8230; yeah I got food poisoning.  Have you ever gotten your stomach pumped? Oh yeah it’s the most god-awful thing you could ever experience.  Yeah I’m in triage.. okay bye.<br>
<br>
Justin would later comment "Once you said triage you had her"<br>
<br>
So around 415 justin calls me up on my cellular telephone and im like dude you have my cell phone, where the F are you&amp;#8230; of course hes on his way down to foxwoods (a casino in Connecticut, which is a good two hours away) and he thinks he’ll make it back on time, but who knows because foxwoods is foxwoods and gambling is gambling and Justin is Justin and I was just extremely worried&amp;#8230; but I hung up the phone and looked at the heap of Russian goodness on top of me and I say "say I have food poisoning in Russian" to whish she spurts out "woiadsllsdk aoiweur;oajdlsfdl" and I pass out.<br>
<br>
Well there aint nothing wrong with that.  I got up, got to work; and that was the end of that, I didn’t ask for her number of anything, I tried to be that cool guy (which I’m not) who just totally dogs the hot girl and is like yeah I don’t care (which I really didn’t but still it would be nice to have someone looking like that to try and hook with whenever I could)<br>
<br>
Moving on.<br>
<br>
The next weekend I played some cards in providence after Justin came down, we went to a bar for a few hours then he went home to work and eric hunter and I played down in RI, we both went 3-3 completely scrubbing out with our light decks, which is why we went down there (to test light).  We both tested wys and both ended up playing combat at origins, go figure.  The bar Justin and I went to was pretty dead, so we mainly just went home and played scrabble.  We have a system where if one of us makes a word and then it gets challenged, we pull a card from out of one of my 3 rare boxes and sign it with the card title, and how many points the word was worth total, along with anything else we come up with.  It’s a pretty phat system it helps us remember words that we never would have known, or just to remind us how stupid we are. (eke, bine, quid, coo, bigs, nom, and wiry are all words, some in upwards of 70 points).<br>
<br>
Another week goes by.  I’m working at the summer camp now and Justin is working part time at Abercrombie.  And all week we are pretty geared up to be going to ohio to play at a major con, which we really haven’t been to before.  Until now the biggest cons we’d been to were dcon and ramapo, freedomcon which aren’t even really big cons like origins, which completely blew us away.  And besides that we’ve never traveled to any of these cons together, so this was going to be a good trip.  In the last week andy klema bailed out on the trip because his friend dave whose in the army and is wicked cool was going to be shipped out this coming weekend and came home to see them.  So we let that slide, even though we tried to get andy, dave and all their friends to party in ohio with us, which would’ve been phat.  And Jeremy oakes bailed on us as well, citing not being able to take off time from his work and his wife and stuff like that EVEN though he just won 2 grand in atlantic city and could’ve totally afforded the trip OAKES YOU BASTARD.<br>
<br>
So Wednesday night rolls around, I get home from camp and start packing like mad on account of I hadn’t started packing at all yet, on account of me going Tuesday night to this girl ali’s house&amp;#8230; well the house she was housesitting for and hooking up with her, which I felt was important because as you should remember I hooked up with her before regionals, then proceeded to have sex with my ex girlfriend, wearing a tshirt the xgirlfriend’s dad gave me, which will prove to be important as I get dressed for the orgyins open&amp;#8230;anyways, I go hook up with ali again, citing extreme superstition of luck, and while im there I totally steal a miniature stormtrooper that belonged to the little boy living in the house (he also had some lotr cards incidentally).  Anyways back to Wednesday night.. Justin missed the first train to worcester so I picked him up about an hour and a half late and we began our 2.5 hour trip to the wonderous Marist College to break up our trip.  <br>
<br>
At marist we stayed with the girl I date at school erin.  We all tried to go see "like Mike" which I think is going to be an amazing movie, but we got in too late so we missed the recent showing and didn’t want to wait for two hours to see the next movie, especially since neither erin nor Justin really wanted to see it anywyas.  We went to blockbuster, and even though I tried SO HARD to get them to rent "I’m gonna get you sucka" we got Orange county, which ended up being really funny at times but also pretty short, pointless and dumb, but I still laughed my @#$% off at bob the cripple ninety year old that colin hanks mother married, and slept with four times for his money.  So Justin went to bed and I don’t want to get into specifics because that would be rude to the girl I actually date, but I had a good time, and made some sweet love a few times and then I went upstairs and woke up Justin with a wicked loud fart in his face while he slept, which he woke up to, and which erin heard downstairs&amp;#8230; it was a pretty monstrous fart.<br>
<br>
Justin and I got up, got some ice, I bought a 5 dollar scratch ticket and won twenty bucks on it (free admission to lotr which I still don’t know ho to play at this point) and head out to ohio which is a nine hour ride from marist.  <br>
<br/>
Pretty early on in the trip we encounter a jeep grand Cherokee with "WizardCon or Bust" in the dirt on the back winshield.. we make a sign and pull up next to them and start screaming about how they should go to origns and im like ’what game do you play’ and they said comics according to Justin but im pretty sure he said ’hobbits’ either way I give them the sign of the devil and yell NAZGULLLLL and scream past them.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the ride consisted of mcdonalds stops, and too many of htem.  We came across a sweet mcdonalds that when you get a meal you can pay a buck extra to get another sandwhich with your meal that comes with a meal.. get it??? So like I got a qp w/cheese meal and threw in a buck to get two cheeseburgers, Justin got double bigmacs&amp;#8230; it makes sense.. only this was in Pennsylvania, which is kind of hickish I guess but I mean, you wouldn’t think so until you go into a mcdonalds and theres a guy who is frigging strapped ordering the filet-o-fish, and he sees me eyeing his gun, because hell I’ve never seen a gun in mcdonalds being carried by a civilian (my dads a cop I’ve seen guns o plenty, but it was just weird to see this I guess, suit me).<br/>
<br/>
Back on the road, we start doing the six degrees of Kevin Bacon, only we cant think of any movies hes been in.  we came up with Hollow Man, Sleepers, The River Wild, and Apollo 13, so most of our moves were connected to Bacon through tom hanks, and usually from meg ryan to tom hanks.  At one point Justin is like Chevy Chase to Kevin Bacon nd im like damn.. and he asks whats that movie where Kevin bacon danced in that town that had music banned and im like "jump back" its called Flashdance, but noone was in it except for John Lithgow.  Duh says Justin.  Lithgow was in Orange County with Chevy Chase&amp;#8230; so that ended that.  After about 9203948203 more Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, the lore game (where Justin would read the lore of a card and id have to guess) we got to Columbus and one of the last exits before ours there is a sign for "New Albany" and I go to Justin. "yo, Justin.  Kashyyyk is the new Albany" <br/>
<br/>
We check into the hotel, I call berta, he’s still at the airport so we head over the con before even going in our room and start seeking people out.  Hayes is there and the twigs but we cant find the Canadians who are supposed to possibly be staying with us, or kim caton and alex tenet who have the lord of the rings deck I am supposed to be using the next day, not to mention I still do not know how to play the game.  Justin and I go to the retailer room and buy some original OTSD’s for 5 bucks, I got 2 and pulled a luke which I wicked wanted, and a threepio which is my fourth and I hate him.  Justin pulled vader which he wanted, and this definitely beat the 20 bucks I spent on an otsd in new york city, where I pulled a jabba, which is what I wanted, but you cannot beat 5 bucks.  Me and Justin actually played a sealed game and he beat me, which usually doesn’t happen but I give him credit for totally dominating space.  Finally we find everyone playing a lotr sealed with the new cards which are not yet legal, and round everyone up and head to the bar.<br/>
<br/>
I meet matt lush in the hallway and he gives me a hug and introduces himself and we go drink at the bar, I do a few shots and have a corona and am moderately buzzed.  I go play my first game of lotr and I don’t remember what happened.  At around 330 eric is like passed out and wants to sleep, I’m ready to go but Justin ends up chilling with bri twigg for the whole night and not getting any sleep.  I head back to the soft bed at the hotel and get nice 5 hours of sleep.  I almost don’t wake up, because im not too thrilled to be playing lotr.  But Justin calls my @#$% and gets me there, and forget the poker chip from trump plaza he was going to use as his adventure path marker, as well as the miniature stormtrooper that I was going to use for mine.  I end up playing Chris Twigg’s lotr deck instead of kim’s because it has a better fellowship and is probably easier to play, and they had a decklist made for me, and kim didn’t, I was late and almost didn’t get in on time, I was player 187 out of 192, so you can tell how late I was running.  I’m not feeling confident anyways and am not entirely thrilled to be playing, but everyone is going to be around and I’d probably be wicked bored if I didn’t, and here’s how that tournament went.<br/>
<br/>
I’m running a Frodo Baggins/Gandalf start.  The pump gandalf that gets wicked strong with different fellows.  I start the site to pull samwise gangi but I never get to go first except for one time so it really didn’t matter. For shadow im running moria, but no goblin swarms which I guess is bad, I saw that card in play later in the day and I regret playing it. Although I really don’t like goblin scouts and junk because they don’t do anything with their junk power 6.  Flankers are cool because they are power 11 and I like the balrog and the cave troll, they are monsters.  More fiercer.<br/>
<br/>
I’m going to do my best on the game info, I don’t really know the game but I played pretty well.  I didn’t get any names really for the lotr, because I don’t really know anyone or recognize any faces, but again, I’ll do my best.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1.<br/>
I actually played someone I know, dom’s girl who played a hobbit start and outbid me with 8, I bid 7.  At site four she mirrored my balrog, my only balrog, why play two balrogs? And we both played pretty slow, but I was pretty far ahead of her, I tried to triple move to site 9 from six with the card that spots gandalf and elf and a dwarf&amp;#8230; I know its not ’boats’  but I got to my regroup phase at site 8 before I had a chance to move to nine, and I easily had the full win but because we both didn’t really know how to play, I didn’t make it there, she was still at site 6 from what I remember.  The game went perfectly for me I just played too slow.<br/>
<br/>
Well all the people with timed wins had to play one another so I got paired up with some other dude with a modified win.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 2.  <br/>
This guy really didn’t have a chance on me, I pretty much double moved every time and just got some good minions when I needed minions and got a pretty beefy fellowship, which happened not so many times in this tournament for me.  Nothing too exciting happened, I used rangers versatility a few times and archery awayed a lot of his guys with aragorns bow and legolas who is pimp and I just outran the guy to site nine.<br/>
<br/>
So I’m 2-0 with a modified win, and a lot of people who actually play the game don’t even have 2 wins so im looking pretty good.  Game 3 I got paired against a guy, I think his name was Richard Head, I’m not positive though.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.<br/>
Before the game the guy tells me that since we both have modified wins that whoever is going to win at the end of the game should get the full win.  Well he is playing hayes deck so he thinks he has it in the bag, and I’m just like whatever its cool with me and we play.  The game is routine I’m at site 8 when time gets called but like a super dikchead he will not give me the full win, citing that if the game had unlimited time that he would get the full win, and he wants me to give HIM the full win, and I’m like hell no and we get in a pretty good arguing match and Justin is yelling @#$% at him and I get pissed and pretty much want to knock the kid out.  Where is maholik when you need him to intimidate small dorky middle aged men.  So the guy says lets play it out anyways even though im taking the damned modified win.  I already packed up my deck but I get my hand back, as it’s still together, which was only 5 cards so I don’t even get to reconcile my hand, I drop 2 flankers and the cave troll when he moves to site 8 and kill his aragorn and his boromir leaving frodo alone, meaning if I could, with 7 cards, have drawn a few minions, I would’ve overwhelmed him at 9 and the game would’ve been mine anyways, so the kid was major dikc anyways and I still got the win and he the loss, and who knows where he finished where I finished in the top 40 in my first 8 games ever playing so screw dikc head.<br/>
<br/>
So I’m 3-0 but with two timed wins I might as well be 2-1.  damn!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4.<br/>
My fourth game I was paired with Matthew Y. from Canada who would end up qualifying for the top 16 and eventually get into the final 8 and swing some cash, so you could imagine how well this game went.  But this guy was wicked cool, he was friends with Dom and Yannick and those guys so all in all it was a good experience to play him, plus he had a sick deck and just totally outgamed me by double moving every time, and pretty much shutting me down completely and I’m not going to into his deck because His and Dom’s decks are just ridiculous, but he beat me by just running to site nine and not letting me really do anything to him at all.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5. <br/>
This guy I recognized but I had no idea who he was really. I could’ve been dreaming that I’d met him, he just seemed familiar. Older guy with a beard.  He said he let me take back a lot of stuff that he normally wouldn’t but to be honest I thought I played pretty solidly and he said he was going to drop after the game anyways, but regardless the guy tried to double move to site nine, and he said he probably would have done it even if he were going to stay in the tournament.  SO I drop a bunch of guys down to site nine and he starts assigning guys but there is one left over and I don’t know what the hell to do and I’m just like "well what happens to this guy" and he tells me that I get to assign him.  I GET TO ASSIGN HIM??? I flipped out and I said "Well I’ll assign him to Frodo Baggins!" and I overwhelm frodo baggins and now I am 4-1.  A nice sidenote to this game, this is the one tournament game where I bid higher than my opponent (he bid zero) and got to go first and play my own site one! Yay for frodo baggins!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
Game six fricking sucked.  Mind you, chris twigs deck has the worst site selection in the entire tournament as far as I saw, and I was deploying my sites often.  Im talking, site 3 spot a ranger to increase move limit.  Site 7, no archery.  Site 5 deploy the balrog&amp;#8230; just kidding&amp;#8230; but regardless I got one minion in my opening hand, and the first three times I reconciled (I did pull a host of thousands and I was able to redeploy that sweet @#$% moria scout one more time before the guy moved from site 1 to site four on me) and that pretty much ended it all.  He didn’t even have to double move, although I tried as often as I could, and many of my fellowship died.  It was a long fought game, and in the end I got the S smacked out of me.  So now I’m 4-2&amp;#8230; crappy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7.<br/>
So the kid I played this game had red hair and glasses and a beard.  He was kind of a dikc, announcing everything I did, double counting the twilight I added, and then when he did the twilight and I double checked it there were too many&amp;#8230; hrmmmmm.  Anyways, this one time I started assigning my guys and he’s like ’you know youre skipping your archery phase’ and I’m like no I’m not that’s just how I think, so I archeried some guys away with legolas and aragorn, but it doesn’t really matter. The guy ran to site 9 and I didn’t even have a chance, so I drop two in a row and I’m pretty pissed off.  Wasting my time playing this @#$%ty game that the pa/nj guys accurately describe as a more detailed version of Candyland&amp;#8230; and their exactly right.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8. <br/>
I’m beat, it’s a long day of a tedious card game, I’m 4-3 with the victory points of a guy 3-4, so it just blows right about now.  I played this asian kid that I played with at the Montreal dpc last august, and he spoke very quietly and really only put down two companions the whole game, and I overwhelmed them at site 5 by playing an orc the balrog and the cave troll all at once, and then frodo baggins was on the run for it all alone!! He didn’t even have samwise to chuck the ring too when he got to site 6.  it was phat playing the barlog, I played the rare one I had never really seen it before I played in the tourney and it ripped people apart all day.  Uruk hai is good and all, but I really wouldn’t give up the balrog, to drop it and the cave troll, which I did four times that day.<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 5-3, and for my first time playing that’s pretty respectable considering I placed better than some of the better people in the game today, who were many in attendance.  It was a record good enough to earn me a spot in the top forty, and out of 193 people that aint damn bad.  I still haven’t gone better than 4-4 in an eight game tourney, so I figure this lotr game is pretty stupi but at the same time, it is something new, and if I had the cards I would probably play more often. <br/>
<br/>
After game 5 we got these shirts, we were supposed to get balrog shirts but we just got the lurtz shirts, and since I don’t play lotr and I would never wear a card shirt we just got everyone to sign it (justin’s idea) and it was phat because we got all the Canadians to sign it, including Yannick, and when he signed it, we were saying how much we hope he wrote crusher, and he did.  Then we gave it to dom, and he started writing and I said, wouldn’t it be phat if he just wrote DOM and he did, and since Justin is so into the Canadians, hell I wont deny It, I am too they are frigging amazing at the card games and all around amazingly amazing guys.  A ton more guys signed the shirt, as well as chicks and it just looks pretty cool to see so many big names at the game who showed up for the tournament all on our shirt, which hopefully we will find some cool way to keep it, for now its still in my trunk. <br/>
<br/>
Also another point of note, This kid mullarkey who we know from home, and some of you may know from a tournament report long since passed in which he surprise assaulted my game in the cantina when I was playing mkos, and that had cost me the game. Started making fun of me because when I get excited I make plenty of gestures and jump around and so mullarkey tries to tell me I look like a @#$% because I wear a shirt with a collar and jump around, and Justin just goes "dude, look at you" and now I’ll take a second to describe john fricking mullarky.  Mullarky is like 6’3, maybe 230-250 lbs with a mop top and a Hitler mustache, and we pretty much called him fat Hitler for the entire weekend because he is such a douchebag.  He plays lotr like it’s his job and ithink he went 1-5 then dropped.. meanwhile I’ve at this point played 8 games of lotr my whole life and well, that’s all I have to say about that.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking to McClure about decks at one point, and we asked what hayes was playhing, he made some smug comment about us scrapping for information on decks, when in actuality we really didn’t care, we figured hayes would play ls senate but we didn’t know if hed play ds senate or huntdown&amp;#8230; either way, McClure guaranteed that we wouldn’t win against either one of his decks.<br/>
<br/>
So after the tournament we get some food, Justin, eric hai, berta and myself.  We head to mcdonalds, and let me tell you it is the cheapest mcdonlads in existence. All the meals were under 5 bucks for the large size, and berta got two sandwhiches that he ate simultaneiously, which is a bit ridiculous, but he got the job done.  During our dinner we were talking in ’lotr speak’ where we are spotting 25 fries and junk like that, it is addicting to talk like that, and I ended up doing it a bunch of times during the starwars tournament the next day, which in actuality pissed me off a great deal because I really do not enjoy lotr or what it represents about decipher and what happened to starwars.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point, and I mean Friday night.  My light deck still isn’t made so we go back to the hotel room and put it together for a little while and I talk to berta and look at digital pictures where Justin and eric play a game, eric wins and we head back to the con.  I still haven’t played a game with my light so Justin and I go to an abandoned stairwell and play because I really don’t want anyone to know what I’m playing, because that will pretty much throw off the whole idea of my deck.  Either way I win, even though Justin knows exactly what im doing because well Justin built it.  We go back to the restaurant, I play a game with jim li using my dark vs. his watch your step and I win, so in the two games I playtested for the entire origins open I went 2-0 which isn’t too bad I guess.  I’m still fairly worried about only playing my light once, and really only having it put together a few hours before the tournament.  We hang around for a little bit but all together head back to our hotel early, and get to bed by about 230.  eric didn’t go back to the con with us, so hes asleep when we get back.  But we find out teddy baseball died, which is pretty sad but in the same way inspiring because you look at what that man accomplished, and being as huge a redsox fan as I am, Justin was surprised I wasn’t upset, I just saw it coming for a while now, and in death you can find a certain appreciation for someone, and I think that’s what I found in Williams, its sad what his son is doing, and hopefully someone can stop him before germany makes an entire army of ted Williams and they invade the united states because we all know teddy baseball was a sick fighter pilot as well as the greatest hitter ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Part II.  Triumph and Conspiracy.<br/>
<br/>
So with a whopping 7 hours, we are the most well rested people at the starwars tournament, except for eric, because well he went to bed at 10pm.  What’s funny is when we got back that night at 230, we woke up eric and convinced him it was time to get up and go to the con to play in the wars open, we told him it was 830 and he kind of flipped out and got all upset, and then we finally let him go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Well we did wake up at about 830 but didn’t get rolling til after nine, which sucks because we still had to register for the tournament, which cost us 3.75 and as it turned out that we didn’t even have to officially register for the tournament and we were probably the few poor schleps that actually did register with the con.  We met up with everyone, and everyone was pretty beat from making decks and stuff all night.  This is the first con ive been to where I wasn’t building decks up until the last minute, which was a bit relaxing.  We made our decklists on random flyers from the con because the players committee didn’t show up until about 1015, and I went to a secluded area of the con where some harry potter tournaments were going on to do my light decklist, and then I came back for the first round pairings after going to the bathroom once.<br/>
<br/>
Since the LOTR tournament day 2 was going on, we got started a little late, and we were missing some big players, who I guess we really didn’t expect to play wars, but were hoping.  These players were dom, clint, yannick, those types of people.  But who was still playing in the tournament? The Terwilligers, The rest of Albany, Hayes, Brian Fred, and also there were people like the McClure’s and Reinhold, Lush.  Of course Kim Caton and Alex tenet played, gogolen played.  And a bunch of other players that I could list but I’m trying to save some space here.  We started out with 69 players, which according to the players committee, would create an eight game tournament, but they scrapped that idea I guess.  We finally got going with the tournament close to an hour late and when pairings got called I got paired up vs. one of the ohio boys.<br/>
For Decks I’m running Justin Desai’s patented DS Senate and for light, A Combat deck that Justin built me, and we worked on for a while tweaking, that starts seeking an audience and uses fire extinguishers to drain and combat.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS Senate vs. 231’s WYS using old school Tat start.<br/>
<br/>
Old school tatooine start? Hot mama pajamas.  Well he goes to space early, leaving luke at kessel in r2/red5 and puts dash at tattooine.  I set up my senate and draw up for things like blast door controls, and my ships.  At one point he is about to drop mirax with squadron assignments, but she isn’t there which disappoints me because I would’ve dropped ship, got rid of dash and beat down on her.  Instead, I wait another turn and drop baron with thrawn in chimera, 3 destiny, don’t shoot, to his one destiny&amp;#8230; 17 card overflow &amp;#8230; in space&amp;#8230;  noice.  This deck is nasty.  At one point I drain big and he plays control to cancel it, so I play my nicely held limited so he cant cancel it out of lost pile. And at the end he drops talon and melas to the ground and I drop maul and finish him off and pull in the win by 22 forces.<br/>
2(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Use the forces! This deck is good.<br/>
Lows : None, you cant complain with 17 overflow IN SPACE<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much everyone wins, only with dark. Chris twigg wins with light, so do some other players but I cant really remember who was playing what first round, but here it goes, as my first test with my light deck, and my first real game.  I played a friend of Brad Kippel’s who was running a ds Combat deck, which I feared as a matchup.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS combat vs another player’s DS combat.<br/>
<br/>
So I start goo nee tay instead of seeking an audience because he really cant battle me anyways.  Well his destiny is sick and he starts racing.  I draw up for a quigon saber before I grab him, I do get artoo and a baragwin in my hand so I drop those with hero of 1000 devices and draw.  He draws, I draw, get my saber. He drops maul with stick, I drop quigon with stick at the site next to him.  We put combat cards on, on his turn I put one on but he doesn’t.  he moves over and combats with one card, I draw 2 sevens, he draws a seven and xizor off the top.  He thought you can only play one combat card a turn, like the shield says if youre not playing combat happens, so he got confused and maul goes bye bye and four more.  I win the race, put another baragwin with artoo at the podrace arena.  He drops vader there to block my drain, but he never makes me lose cards and I have to play a step backwards to get back a lando I lost somehow just so I can retrieve some force with ’I did it’ he drops maul again at one point and combats me with one seven and one blind, and draws the xizor, so byebye goes maul and four off the top.  He drops sidious, I combat him, four more.  This guy really didn’t have a chance, my deck just locks down it’s force loss and I win by 29 forces.<br/>
4(+51)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: My deck worked like a charm against what I thought would be a tough match.<br/>
Lows: The fact he messed up with the first combat pissed him off and he was dejected.<br/>
<br/>
This win puts me in a good spot but not at the top, or even that close to it.  Everyone else good wins their games and I get paired up with my light again, this time versus a hunt down deck, which I am excited to play, because it hink it is a good matchup for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my light combat vs some player’s Hunt Down.<br/>
<br/>
I set up with fire extinguisher and baragwin first turn and draw up to get a quigon, next turn I drop him and start draining.  He pulls some mobie system docking bays and puts vader at the cloud city dbay, which means he does absolutely nothing there as he cant drain, and I continually drain.  Win the race turn three.  Control all of my visage force loss with devices and retrieval with the baragwins.  He comes down a few times and tries to flip me back and drain at the site next to me, but I just move all my junk over and combat him away, making him lose massive force.  This time there is actually something to retrieve and I do so with I did it, but no edge as I have difficulty with the patience of tracking 36 cards through my deck.  At the end he drops some guys because he wants to go down in a battle, but I don’t go fight tarkin alone in case he has something crazy up his sleeve, then he drops boba fett with upkeep and moves them over, I zap fett and drop lando and battle and that finishes him off and I win by 36 forces.<br/>
<br/>
6(+87)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: 36 forces with light is huge when youre not playing qmc.<br/>
Lows : Absolutely none.<br/>
<br/>
So this puts me in second behind hayes hunter, who just won with his dark.  This means I have to play my dark senate vs his light.  Justin is completely confident in this match, I however am not.  I freak out, we go put money in my parking meter and I try and get Justin to reassure me of the matchup.  We just threw in an extra aks moe the night before, so we had extra ls senate tech, if you could call it that.  We go back into the hall and im trying not to freak out, and as I sit down I begin to feel confident and I sit next to Justin who is playing eric with his light at the second table spot.  This is phat because kashyyyk represents the top four spots at origins.  Kim takes pictures of the spectacle for us and we begin playing.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my DS senate vs. hayes’ light senate<br/>
<br/>
Well the game starts off good as I get a sick opening hand, 2 senators and a squabble.  I also get ability x3 but I never actually deploy it because I don’t want to invite him to come down to the senate first turn.  Either way, he gets his hand and goes, hey mcclure! And mcclure goes "oh you win" to this eric tells hayes to shut up, which was cool of him to back me up when hayes was showboating.  I put down lott dodd and toonbuck.  He puts down bacta tank.  But in his first turn I forget to get a political effect, and in my second turn I forget to grab a docking bay. I do vote now for four cards and throw down some more senators.  Early on, his like third turn, I have nothing to deploy, he has five cards in hand, I make him drop two which sets him back a ton, and I am in good shape. This is pretty much how the game goes from here on in.  he drops palpatine and obi wan, or palpatine and obi wan and battles, draws low, I lose one from the battle (he starts dtf, I start colo claw so he cant, our ls senate deck my only idea for the deck haha) and I lose a senator as well.  After I lose three I squabble but at this time I have the senate held down.  I get the baron/ship/system combo early but I don’t deploy it stupidly. Finally I do, and then I say go.  He goes probably battles me again.  Now the next turn I am activating and he’s acting all surprised at baron at my system. I say drain four, ping for one, drop two cards and lose four to limited.  9 card loss in a game that looked stalemate.  His jaw drops.  From here on in I start draining as fast as I can and he battles me, I lose a card, sometimes a senator when I don’t subtract from his destiny.  Thing is I always have my senator, I just save it for the drain or whatever I want basically.  Time is getting called soon and he asks me to draw up, but says he will happily draw up.  Hayes got a draw up in game 2, he would again get one in game 5, I told him I want to win origins, he will most likely get the buy.  He draws up when he has few cards left and I get the full win by 20.<br/>
8 (+108)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating hayes when he got a mint start. McClure eating his words.<br/>
Highs : Eric and Sokol backing me up when hayes was talking smack.<br/>
Lows: The game going to time, holding my space stuff too long.<br/>
<br/>
So that puts me in the top spot, eric is in second.  So I play eric with my light, which is a tough matchup.  Justin lost to eric’s isb, which again is a tough matchup because eri’c isb is just sick and now I have to play it&amp;#8230; yay<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my LS Combat vs. Eric Hai’s ISB Bombers.<br/>
<br/>
I drop down and hold to my one site, the 3/2.  I get underworld out, I had artoo in my hand.  I put yoda down, anything to get me to activate the most force.  He goes to naboo with jonus and zuckuss, he tried to combat response for baron instead of zuckuss but saber 1 wasn’t there so my han/chewie/falcon becomes obsolete.  He puts mad walkers and guys to his &lt;&gt; dbay on naboo to limit my drain.  I throw artoo, the baragwins, threepio, yoda and obi wan there.  He bombs my site.  he puts his guys inside the walkers, declares his power 14.  I go to space with hcf and move over to coruscfant where he is draining me with a unique sd.  Down comes baron, I draw four destiny with life debt and clear that system.  He moves his walkers over to executor.  I start draining for more.  At one point I try to go to the podrace arena with lando and luke.  He overloads luke at random.  He is draining me for little, and I him for little, we are both retrieving little with his objective and my baragqwins.  He moves his guys back, does not take them out of the walker.he tramples artoo, battles, declares his power 33. which is mad shady.  To my power of very little, I lose everything but a baragwin who I move over to try and control the force loss.  I edge for six but it is too little too late and I am outdrained and beaten by 11 forces.<br/>
8(+97)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: keeping it close in a really bad matchup<br/>
Lows : Eric’s imperial walker maneuver more than doubing his power.<br/>
<br/>
Well Justin wins his game, but I still have the highest diff in the tourney and I am stuck playing the only undefeated person, eric hunter and his ls combat similar to Johnny chu’s.<br/>
I go to the bathroom for about the 20384355320328th time that day, and eric gets me a water, as I walk back through the con room I am very angry, like a man with a mission, and I had one, but I was acting like it.  It was confidence boosting.  With my dgma pin secured tightly into the fly of my pants, I sit down for my sixth and final game of the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my ds senate vs. eric hunters ls combat<br/>
<br/>
I set up the senate, he puts down tons of icons for me so that in my third turn I activate 17.  in his second turn he put down obi wan to his 2/2 site.  down comes baron to the system and maul to the site, battle, maul strikes, I have you now, draw 4,5,7 and he takes 17 overflow.  I get pissed at myself because I figure he has the houjix and I wasted all my adders, well he doesn’t and takes the 17 forces.  He wins his race the next turn but my coward prevents him from retrieving.  I lose six then spot 6 senators with squabble and get it all exactly back.  I lost my drain cancellor effect early so I cant shut down the malastaire drain with home1, but abilityx3 and my drains and limiteds and things like that are putting him away solidly, I put porn free ta back and when the dust settles I win by 25.<br/>
10(+118)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I just won my first tournament<br/>
Lows : Beating my friend with a huge beatdown<br/>
<br/>
Here is where the controversy kicks in.  Justin beats brian twigg by 32 because of ungrabbed edges, which puts him at a diff of 102.  hayes diff is 89 which means he has to win by 13.  so instead of calling hayes’ game after 60 minutes, eric olson decides to let hayes keep playing because, and I quote "the game matters"  well it mattered for a bunch of other people too.  Letting hayes have 20 extra minutes to get a full win instead of a timed win, put hayes in third place instead of about 6th place, giving him the bye instead of eric hunter.  During the phantom 20 minutes, we tried to appeal to both Andrew howard and eric olson but eric had the final say and we really could do nothing&amp;#8230; which is horrible because origins is the first big tournament that was put in the hands of the players committee and they absolutely f’d it up harder than any tournament I’ve ever been to. Moreso than worlds day 1 in 2k&amp;#8230; more than anything.  No offense to the players, they just should not have been allowed extra time at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone is all enamored by what happened with hayes game as it was going on and noone really understood the fact that I just won the sanctioned origins tournament. Which is a huge deal with 69 players.. it’s a big tournament!! Finally I convince everyone to be excited for me.  Hayes’ game finally ends and he doesn’t win by 13 and its me and Justin h20 desai in the finals.<br/>
<br/>
The kashyyyk train of dominence finally descended upon the swccg gaming community.<br/>
<br/>
Two regional runner ups with a sick as dark side senate deck just broke the top two spots at the biggest tourney of the year so far.  And we were pretty happy about it.  Noone really stuck around for the final except for matt sokol, which was cool.  Olson and howard supervised it too.  The Albany guys play some raw deal and everyone else pretty much disappears.  Me and Justin sit down to play, I elect to play dark first, because I basically know it’s a win and know how much I have to lose by in order to win the final, because I doubted that our dark would lose, even if I did beat it last night in a playtesting match.  On to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Extremely meaningful bonus game #1<br/>
My ds senate vs justins wys.<br/>
We’ve played this matchup before.  I kick him off a system (kessel) early.  Hes got drains going at some docking bays.  I drop vader to block one, he dies, the drain stays.  I drop maul to tattooine and he starts running around blocking drains.  Vader gets placed out of play when we demonstrate how cool a mirrors out of commission would be when the player gets to choose two cards from the lost pile and picks one to be put out of play.  So byebye vader.  The rest of the game becomes a drain race / senate tech damage race, and without much battling except for han in the falcon to take out my ships, I pull out the win by 14.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well winning the matchup.  Justin knows the deck better than anyone, he built it.<br/>
Lows: now I have to beat this nasty senate or try and lose to it by less than 14&amp;#8230;14 is the smallest the deck has ever won by.<br/>
Other: This game was phat because mad people took pictures of us playing during it.<br/>
<br/>
Since Justin and I were playing identical dark decks, I just handed him mine and whipped out my combat deck, we threw down our stuff, shook hands one more time.  And drew hands.<br/>
<br/>
Justin got a god draw.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my ls combat vs justin’s my justin’s senate with a god draw.<br/>
My hand aint that shabby either.  I get artoo down with an extinguisher and a baragwin first turn to try and put pressure on him, but I know that hes got the extra senator to cancel the drain because hell I saw his hand, he showed it to me.  Next turn I get down quigon and I’m pretty set.  I start looping my devices.  He’s limiteds me early&amp;#8230; I lose four cards, one of which, I did it.  Doh!  So I win the race, he squabbles.  From here on in it is a drain race and I cant get any of my lowly space stuff to try and even go at him there, and finally the drains start to get to him as im trying to loop my devices, but sometimes you just cant get the device thing off, if theyre not on top, plus paying four to retrieve two is tough.  I drop yoda to put some more pressure on him, hoping maybe that I can hold off a beatdown til I can snag an obiwan or something, no luck.  Vader comes down, but doesn’t hit and and instead of losing 11 I lose like yoda and four.  I couldn’t get my edge off because I never got obi wan or luke out, and without I did it I retrieved 0 force from anything other than baragwins.  In the end I was trying to track a one to retrieve 2 with nar shadda (whoohoo) but I couldn’t get it done and I ended up losing by 9, which isn’t bad because it catapults me into the winning spot of origins.  <br/>
<br/>
Yay for school.  My first tournament win just happens to be a 70 man battle royal with 20 2000 rated players and 5 2100s.  not bad.  <br/>
<br/>
So like I said before, since Justin and I had already gotten byes, they got pushed down to hayes hunter and graham ’keep it honest’ neal.  And if not for the players committee debacle, then it would’ve gone to eric hunter who came in fifth.  Now a lot of people are asking what I won for winning such a large and historically important tournament.  Heres what I got: a lousy deciphercon2k tshirt with the emperor on it.  A maul with saber foil.  That’s it.  Not even a can of soda.  Not even anything.  Nada.  I just wish decipher gave 2 shtis about this game, even if they don’t have a license, swccg made that company, they could show a little faith since it outsold swtcg last month, and has such a massive cult following.  I dunno, give me some packs of cloud city, mention the tourney on the website.  Anything really, would be appreciated.  Life sucks sometimes in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
Well after the tournament, we get some cards signed.  Its funny before the final some little kid like 9 was in the bathroom (yikes this story sounds bad aleady) and hes putting his cards into his pockets and im like dude don’t do that to your cards, so I float him a deck protector box, the blue plastic ones that come with the plastics with the little triangles at the bottom.  I dunno, he was a good kid probably and I didn’t want him ruining his lord of the rings cards.  Afterwards when we were doing signings, he came over and gave me some warlord cards (which came free when you registered for the con) but still it was nice of him, and I signed is lotr site 5 and he signed my dark numbers canceller shield.  I didn’t get many cards signed, just my shields, which is phat because noone usually has signed shields, or at least I haven’t seen one, so it was fun.  We went back to the bar, I played some scrabble with kim who wouldn’t play me the previous day, citing "I was up playing with your @#$% all night" cricket&amp;#8230;cricket&amp;#8230; tumbleweed&amp;#8230;<br/>
Mainly we just do some chilling and drinking, everyone is wicked @#$%ed except for me and Justin.  Kim bought me a shot, four horsemen of the apocalypse&amp;#8230; daniels, beam, quervo and some other dude I cant think of, but it smelled like turpentine.  At about 2-230 we called it a night because we had a wee bit of driving the next day (only 12 hours). <br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, we also went to a restaurant, me, eric, Justin, the twigs, sokol, aaron kingery.  It was pretty phat bar/restaurant.  Pretty expensive but I treated myself to a chicken parm meal.  We just hung and took pictures and signed some more cards and basically talked about what virtual card I should make.  Ranging anywhere from a new death star to a broken effect you can start with heading for the medical frigate.  The card would compeltey change the game and literally bring balance to the force&amp;#8230; but I’m not going to make it.  I think people will dig the card I make. Its not super good, but it’s a cool fricking idea.<br/>
<br/>
We got back to the hotel, I completely crashed I was exhausted.  At like 330 I got a phone call on my cell that woke us up but I didn’t get it in time, apparently it was one of my girlfriends from high school drunk.  I still see her from time to time so it wasn’t that weird, but like&amp;#8230; yeah it was cause I see her like twice a year.  I got back to sleep and had the strangest fricking dream ever.  I dreamt I was still with my girlfriend from the last two years and we were still together, like never broken up&amp;#8230; she was pregnant with my kid, and she’d given me aids&amp;#8230; yikes&amp;#8230; only light at the end of THAT tunnel is that at some point I would finally succumb to the aids.<br/>
<br/>
We get up at like 1030 and we get eric back to the con and pretty much just start driving due east.  We talk a lot about the tournament, the games, the amount of shti that was talked to us over the course of the weekend, especially by McClure and Pete Sordorski.  We discussed the implications of us finishing in the top two, how legit we are (pretty legit) and the shady dealings of the players committee.  We do a few more six degrees of Kevin bacon.  We do the two degrees of mike gemme connecting me to every player in the top ten within two moves, except for the guy from spain, noone I’ve beaten has played that kid as far as I know, but 9/10 aint bad.  We actually get kind of lost and head all the way to Cleveland and we get to see browns stadium and the Indians stadium, which is kind of cool.  We find I-90 which is strange, because we’re like "hey we got one of those in Mass, its called the Mass Pike" figuring it’s the same one, we jump on that and ride it all the way back to Worcester.  Stopping only to change drivers once and then again in Amsterdam, NY, the city of a thousand banks.  Where I stayed when I was 13 and went to the baseball hall of fame with my dad and his friend danny. <br/>
<br/>
Quick sidenote. Im lifeguarding at the hotel I work at, the one that gives me  the discount on my hotels when I go away, and two ppl just got into the hot tub, and theyre like late 30s and making out and the guy is totally feeling the girl up and kissing her breasts&amp;#8230; I am literally 7 feet away from them right now&amp;#8230; yikes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, back to Amsterdam.  We go to this pizzaria and the guy wont let us eat in there even though they don’t close for another half hour, he says they already swept and shti.  So we go sit on my car, by a newspaper, read the worlds worst editorial by some fat guy whose wife is gone for fourth of july weekend.  Podunk newspapers are really so terrible.  We bust out the warlord decks we got for registering as well as the packs we got for it, and we have no idea how to play the game but it seems pretty horrible.  Justin pulled a rare foil which is cool.  My rare was a horse possession. Bill the pony. Damn.  <br/>
<br/>
We eat our bacon and hamburger pizza, and get back on the road.  We get home around 1130 making it a 12 hour trip including the half hour stop in Amsterdam for pizza.  The first thing we do is check our fantasy teams, which I haven’t all weekend.  Of course mark burhle is on my bench and pitches 7 scoreless.  My last 5 starts when he’s actually in, he’s 0-4 with an era over 4.  damn.  The second thing we do? We frigging crash.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning we get up at like 645 so I can take Justin to the airport and get to work so I can talk to the amazingly gorgeous 17 yr old blonde bombshell with green and blue eyes and aljdl;asfalsjfasdj she’s just good.  The long weekend of intercourse and card playing is behind us and we look forward to deciphercon2k2.  wow.  Try typing deciphercon into word and its got a squiggly red line under it.  Type decihpercon2k2&amp;#8230; no line&amp;#8230; its all good.  Weird.  Well I really hope I haven’t forgotten anything.  This thing is only 17 pages single spaced, which aint bad I guess.  I’ve still got props and slops to do.  I think my freedomcon report is longest to date (note 23 single spaced).  So I’m gonna bounce.  Origins winner. What what. <br/>
<br/>
Maddest Props Imaginable<br/>
<br/>
Justin H20 Desai for making my decks, being my partner, we won this tournament bro, not just me.  This is huge for us.  The next few months will be insane, whether it be stealing street signs of Olga Av (which is off Belmont street in Worcester) or going to leitrums, screaming "shots" to get girls, or playing an occasional game of cards or an occasional 23 games of scrabble in a row.  I would’ve came in last at this thing without your decks, and we both know that.  So great job, and it’s not over yet.<br/>
