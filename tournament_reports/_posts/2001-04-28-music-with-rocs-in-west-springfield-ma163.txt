<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Title because Terry pratchett is cool and I was playing ROC.<br>
<br>
Pre-tourny:<br>
the week before i had played raltir so i needed a new deck because i didn’t want to play raltir two tournaments in a row, in case anyone added ounee ta. So i needed a new dark deck but didn’t know what to play.  i’m looking at decktech and see the cowboys from **** deck and try to build it.  Unfortunately i don’t have a lot of the troopers so that doesn’t work.  I still want to play ISB because I love ISB. i start building my ISB, only to find out I traded all my ORS’ away. so i Improvise.  i stick in a bunck of mains and the Much Anger in Him/Responsibility of Command combo and i’m set. I name this deck Music with rocs in (hence the title.)  For light I play WYS with RFC’s because i don’t have palace raiders. when we show up at the tourny, everyone there is yelling at us for messing up their west springfield wookie tournament. I guess they wanted to have an all west springfield tourny, and since we are from CT, they can’t have it. well, i was expecting to see brentson there, but he didn’t show up so my main competition was Karl Sundberg.  and first round, i am am paired with... Karl Sundberg.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Music with rocs in vs. Karl Sundberg (1909) OMDH<br>
he isn’t too happy about playing me because his record vs. me isn’t that great, and i almost always beat him with my dark. i don’t remember the star of this games at all, so we will skip towards the end. I have some agents and a couple walkers on the ground, with the roc combo on luke and 2 agents in front of him (i knew he had a sniper in hand.) we each hold a site with our people.  We both have a good space fleet, me with Chimaera/thrawn, boba/ship, him with indepennce with horn aboard, and outrider with dash and wedge aboard.  i would be winning because of much anger, but he has OTE out and i lost point man. he’s losing 4 to anger, i’m losing 3 to OTE, and our drains are about equal, so the space battle will decid the game. he battles in space, i draw high enough to kill a charater, i am immune. he loses horn. he runs away with the rest.  my turn i don’t follow because now he has to pay to drain, and we are both low on force. karl takes his turn, and while taking it time runs out.  so he drains, loses to anger, andcounts.  he has 5 i have 8. sorry for the lack of detail, but i just didn’t remember much of this game, even though it was a great game.<br>
<br>
TW +8<br>
1 +8<br>
<br>
Good: I won<br>
Bad: anger didn’t come out for a while<br>
Ugly: Luke wanted to sniper himself, but it was ruled he couldn’t<br>
<br>
dark did a complete sweep, so i’m playing whoeverlost by the most.<br>
<br>
Game 2: WYS vs. Mike Sanzo (1479) Endor Ops<br>
Well endor ops is real popular around here, and i know it is good, but i also no this kid doesn’t have that many cards and probably doesn’t have enough imperial commands to make it good. i draw a decent hand, a few RFC’s, luke, some other stuff. not much happend this game, i deployed flipped, set up celebration and Menace Fades, and took over the endor DB in the end.we had one battle in space at tatooine, i played R2, i have a bad feeling about this, and drew a few fives. he had enough of that and left. the rest of the games i just retrieved all the damge he did to me and drained him out.<br>
<br>
FW +20’s<br>
3 +30’s<br>
<br>
Good: I won<br>
Bad: nothing<br/>
Ugly: I had to beat a scrub.<br/>
<br/>
there are 2 other undefeated players, and since i have a timed win, i can’t play either of them. i have to hope that the dark player wins, so i can play him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: WYS vs. Garrett Boella (1533) Raltir ops<br/>
he copies my deck from last week that i destroyed his EBO with, but didn’t have some of the walkers and mains i used. before this game he showed me his deck and i noticed that he only had three ships in it. i start out with a good hand, chewie, three RFC’s and some interupts. i flip fast, and he flips soon after. i put dash and theron nett at the system, set up I’ll take the leader, menace fades, and celebration.  right now we are both draining for three, but i am retrieving three so i’m ahead.  he deploys vader to the docking bay against 2 RFC’s, but vader gets fallen portalled. I add luke with saber to my fourth site, so now i’m retreving more than he is doing. also, he already lost 2 of his ships, he can’t hurt me in space.  he says that he doesn’t have any mains left because most of them went to my drains, and he doesn’t want me to retrive more so he draws up.<br/>
<br/>
FW +18<br/>
5 + low 50’s<br/>
<br/>
Good: I won<br/>
Bad: He drew up<br/>
Ugly: Vader got smashed by a big door<br/>
<br/>
i got lucky, the dark player won so if i win this game i win the tourny.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Music with rocs in vs. Steve Petingal (?) OMDH<br/>
Steve is a decent player, but i feel confident because i beat karl and karl is better than steve. so i draw a god had (fett and zuckuss in ship, hoth war room, ROC, twilek, and a couple agents.  So i activate my three, play twilek and get anger. now i have the whole combo in my hand first turn. on his turn he just activates and draws. i drop fett in ship to carida, later and add zuckuss with Jonus piloting next turn, then draw my remainign force both turns.  I finally get a enough agents to flip, but before i can he attacks me at carida.  He deploys falcon with Han and luke JK piloting, and obi w/saber as a passanger.  he battles and plays gift of the mentor.  i draw a 2, and he draws... 4 1’s. all i had to forfiet was fett. he was immune. my turn i drop the combo on luke, then 3 agents to my docking bay, which flips my objective because i had jonus in space. he deploys leia with gun and corran to battle me. he misses and i draw a zero, forfiet an agent to attrition. then he lose to anger and moves corran and leia away, then lets me go. I attack leia and corran with lord vader and his stick.  both of his die, i lose nothing. his turn he drops OTE loses to his anger, and draws. I point man and drain, and add more agents to a third docking bay. on his turn he snipers luke with obi (i’m not sure if he could do this, but i didn’t care because he couldn’t hurt me at the system and i had already won this game).  he didn’t battle because he wouldn’t have been able to draw destiny because of zuckuss. he deployed lando with ax to the docking bay then sends his ships over to tatooine and lands them.  he gets 1 drain of 1 in before he dies.<br/>
<br/>
FW +20<br/>
7 + low 70’s<br/>
<br/>
Good: yep, you guessed it, I won<br/>
Bad: nothing<br/>
Ugly: Four 1’s in a row.<br/>
<br/>
as the only undefeated player i won the tournament, and got a leia with blaster foil and a few packs for prixe support. nothing great in my packs, but someone pulled a jap. trample and that was cool. now for props and slops<br/>
