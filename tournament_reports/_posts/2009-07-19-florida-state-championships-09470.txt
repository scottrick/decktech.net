<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Florida State Championships 09<br>
<br>
<br>
We met at Books inc. in Gainesville Florida at 9:30 am... people began to filter in. Truth be told I posted the 9:30 start time in hopes that the traditionally time challenged Jax crew would actually arrive by the REAL 10:00 start time... and the boys were EARLY for the first time I can remember EVER. ;)<br>
 Funny they knew what was up, the shop doesn't open till 10 am. Hooray for psychology and starting on time. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure why the dismal turnout, but we had only 7 players. I had contacted John "Throdo" Murry about some of his crew showing up, and I submited my post for the tourney on the web page way in advance... but I don't think it was ever submitted, never turned up on the calender. Hey stuff happens. I knew my test partner Joe Dorte would <br>
not be able to attend. Joe has had a job promotion and is expecting his first child, so he has to keep a low profile for a while.  A few others contacted me concerning their inability and sorrow at not being able to attend. So the magnificent 7 play...<br>
<br>
In attendance, Myself, John "rancor34" Yakulevich, perennial nice guy of star wars ccg and perhaps the oldest living star wars ccg player in captivity. Jax crew: Travis "the hat" Cooper aka "invisible threat" on the boards, and "the Reverend" Joe La Porta, Father and son team Rick and Aaron Moller. Aaron is known as "halfwingseen" on the boards and has been doing pretty well in online tournaments and games and locals/league events. He is very creative and knows the game very well. Michael Faughn is a tournament director from Orlando back when the game started out, and has found his way back to the game, he brought another old friend and blast from the past Jimmiy Ellis. Good as always to see them!<br>
<br>
 As magnificent as 7 is it is equally odd and thus produces a bye. CRAP!...in a six round match up 6 different people get a bye. Nobody gets the bye twice. this is kinda silly maybe we should have just done 4 rounds... but I promoted it as a 6 round event with a final confrontation and by golly that is what we are gonna have.<br>
Maybe I should have bowed out but I REALLY want to play... I offer to take the first round bye. The boys say it is fine to do random selection.<br>
<br>
And so you get to see the tournament from my perspective...<br>
<br>
first round<br>
<br>
My 3/2 mains vs "Rev." Joe La Porta's Huntdown (V)<br>
<br>
Joe has had great success with Huntdown (V) this league season and has played it pretty regularly. It has been proven to do well against a variety of decktypes. I played 3/2 early in the season, became a bit disenchanted with it then ralized that it had been my most consistent deck in <br>
playtesting and tournaments... 8 wins and 1 loss. So I played it.<br>
<br/>
I really don't remember a lot of this game other then Joe had me sweating it out about midway it shifted in his favor when he took the 3/2 site from me. I was finally able to get it back and drain him out .<br/>
The game was really more exciting then my poor memory allows...<br/>
<br/>
I get the Full win  by +7<br/>
<br/>
Round 2 <br/>
<br/>
My Dark side Endor ops vs Michael Faughn's Profit beatdown.<br/>
<br/>
if Michael has a signature deck, this is it. I have played against it a number of times over the years in various forms, and I know this... stay the heck off Tatooine! he will kill you ;)<br/>
Michael is a great guy and a really great player, he is trying to play catch up on the new V cards and went with something he knows well, Profit!<br/>
 I started with Imperial decree and set up/ flipped early force choking and enforcing battle plan to make him pay to drain. I knew the ping damage was going to be a killer especially if he had any retrieval. It was another close game my win was only by 6. <br/>
capping his drains and making him pay to drain was masterful, sending  blizzard 2 w/ space vader to tatooine to block a drain maybe not so much lol. Michael is always a pleasure to play against.<br/>
<br/>
I get the full win by +6<br/>
<br/>
Round 3 <br/>
<br/>
my 3/2 vs Rick Moller's space madness/ endor ops platform<br/>
<br/>
Rick is playing an odd  space deck , i have seen it before and it has massive power in space. Fortunately for me the 3/2 stays the heck out of space and drains like a beast on the ground... so that's what I tried to do. The game was completely <br/>
non interactive him setting up in space and me taking over as many ground locations as i could get my hands on. I had the 3/2 with Mace (V), Endor Db with Jedi Luke/ saber and Qui gon master and a saber. <br/>
In the bunker  Il-spy droid and Obi wan J/k show up. He has a death grip on Endor and Tatooine late game he gets Naboo also.<br/>
<br/>
I get the full win by +23<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 4 <br/>
<br/>
My Endor Ops vs Aaron Moller's Yavin 4 Jedi Luke deck<br/>
<br/>
Aaron is running careful planning to get the system and 2 locations on Yavin 4 to start. His brother Zack had run this or a very similar deck a month or so ago so I had a vague idea of how <br/>
it might go... but had no real idea of how much space he might be packing. the format is pretty flexible, you could go a lot of different ways with it. I made the descision to try to do a lot of damage early and hopefully get rid of<br/>
what ever space package he had lurking. The descision to start Imperial decree was key, really happy I put in in the day before! The new Yavin 4 site pulls jedi knight Luke and he uses sal tor kal fas to get the saber. Luke is a very <br/>
formidable opponent if you come for him and a drain of 3 if you don't. So I just gave Aaron the site and the drain of 2 capped by Imp. decree and set up my sites and systems. I don't remember him challenging me in space but he did send<br/>
 the Iln- spy droid and Rebel princess Leia with anikin's saber to hold the bunker. I just drained around him in space and out side for 2 at the DB and 2 at the back door, 2 at endor system and 3 at fondor, 4 at yavin 4. No battles that I remember.<br/>
<br/>
I get Full win by +20<br/>
<br/>
round 5 <br/>
<br/>
My 3/2 vs current leader Travis "the hat" Cooper, CR(V) Coruscant mains.<br/>
<br/>
Travis is the leader on the day with a huge differential. I know mains can go either way... this is gonna be tough for both of us... who ever gets the 3/2 location is pretty sure to win the game.<br/>
He starts and pulls Sidious and a saber to the chancellors office and gets to drain me for a turn or two. I decide to play conservatively and drop Boush to block the drain and go for the 3/2 site instead of try to beat down sidious. <br/>
perhaps a mistake, I had the beef to hurt him with Obi jk and mace V  but sent mace to the 3/2. I forgot to pull leia's gun. maybe not too big a deal but he put janus down and I wanted to sniper him lol. Travis in turn tries to sniper<br/>
 leia bossh, I grab the sniper and he misses !?! wow. meanwhile all heck has broken out at the 3/2 I send crazy fett to used and disarmed vader  win a big fight and cause some damage. Maul YAP w/ double saber and phantom menace soon ruin my day.<br/>
 I was not able to really challenge him at the 3/2 again ... dropping a obi/j/k and a Luke JK at 2 different times but epic failed at getting a weapon. I loose this one by 15.<br/>
<br/>
Full loss -15<br/>
<br/>
Here is where the day goes south... round 6 Me vs THE BYE!<br/>
 yeah I'm in second place and I have the bye lol sucktacular!<br/>
the 2 victory points are the only high point to this. Interestingly enough Travis and I at the end of round 6 are tied for victory points... his differential is literally almost triple mine I have 10(+51) ,, Travis has 10 (+151) holy crap.<br/>
 Still I'm in second place with one loss, Travis is in 1st place with 2 timed victories.<br/>
<br/>
THE FINAL CONFRONTATION!<br/>
round 1<br/>
<br/>
I pass out prize support to the guys leaving and Travis and I start the final confrontation. To my understanding it is a clean slate 2 matches. Travis is the leader so I give him the option of choosing which side he would like to play first. He goes for the rematch...<br/>
My 3/2 has a good track record and I'm convinced I can make a better play then last game.I was horribly wrong I did not get much of a starting hand and had to draw  2 times before I could get anythging going he pulled sidious and started with a freakin' god hand... <br/>
by third turn he was out force generating me by more then double. Nothing went my way.He was dropping house cleaning crews of 3-4 characters and I was lucky to muster a lone character. Travis set two records for the deck today...it had one loss  before today... he beat it by 15 in regular play then in the final confrontation  brutalized it by +32! ouch.<br/>
It does not look good for me to win the next game by 33.<br/>
<br/>
round 2<br/>
<br/>
Travis is playing the rescue the chancellor deck/ whap V with mains and massive beatdown potential as well as a cool little retrieval loop. He has the naboo DB and a Secure route V  to take any card from his lost pile back to hand.<br/>
I got my Endor ops ... it takes him like 3 turns to set up the rescue and since my play partner loves the clone deck I have had lots of chances to practice against it. I pull the shield to make him pay extra for non unique and a grabber immediately. <br/>
I flip first turn banking on him not having spies , leaving Ozzel alone at the bunker for a turn... allows me  to set up Baron Fel with a gun at his coruscant system for a drain of 4 second turn. third turn I go to fondor with Vader in his shuttle to get <br/>
a drain of 3 total drain of 7 set up. I back up ozzel so I can draw destiny. 4th turn I drop saber 3 at endor and put down 2 at-st's at the DB and at backdoor... I can react to a battle it he starts junk so I figure I can take the hit and pay to drain in space if need be.<br/>
He sets up on coruscant but his drain bonuses are toast because of Imperial decree! I have to put down a lot on table to drain , his objective forces me to have 2 cards with ability to drain. He comes after me in space but han chewie and falcon only get one destiny and my <br/>
admirals order makes my ties immune to insane amounts. Liea in counselor ship and screamin' lando also make a flailing attempt to knock me out of space and get ground to dust by the imperial war machine. Check this... end of game I have 3 cards in my lost pile.BUT I only won by +18.<br/>
<br/>
So Travis Cooper is your new Florida State champion! Congrats!<br/>
