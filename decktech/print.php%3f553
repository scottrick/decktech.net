<br />
Before getting to the winners (we've listed a top 3 for each), let's take a minute to thank our great sponsor, <a href='http://www.cardagora.com'>CardAgora</a>. CardAgora has been sponsoring contests, and its owner, John Arendt, has been a top contributing member since DeckTech's inception 8 years ago.<br />
<br />
And now the winners!<br />
<br />
<b>Top Allied Teams</b><br />

<br />
The Four Horseman, while not a particularly creative team, is a very efficient, mobile and versatile team, thus getting the nod over the excellent balanced American powerhouse of Death from Above<br />
<br />

#3 <a href='http://www.decktech.net/wars/decks/decks.php?deck=35515'>Ginsu Warriors</a> - Mike "The Judge" Blumberg<br />
<br />
The judges at CardAgora felt that the raw efficiency of the SS Panzergrenadiers inched out the creative and balanced play of the Supported Brummbar. <br />
