<br />
Wow, hidden characters, and you cant be the target of effects?  That's a prety handy piece of equipment.  Looks like the Fate Artifacts should make for some intesting game play<br />

And for somebody's amusement DT gets very strange preview cards...such as a 20/12 7 drop w/ no game text. "He's big" "Yep" !
