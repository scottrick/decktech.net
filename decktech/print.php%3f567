Find the auction <a href=http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22640 target=x>here!</a><br />
<br />
Everyone is encouraged to participate! For those who cannot afford to bid, donations are graciously accepted as well. Here are the details of the auction from Scott himself:<br />
<br />
This is an auction I'm running on the PC site for the rest of the Month. I'm just going to be taking bids through email or through posting here, I do not have an eBay account but if someone would like to set it up for me on eBay, we can run it just as if it was on here but through eBay itself, putting in bids through accounts just the same (If you would be willing to run this on your eBay account, please contact me.)<br />
<br />
All money raised will be going to Mike Carr's family who, if you haven't read his blog, have been going through an exhausting time with the birth of their child.<br />
<br />
If you have children you know how stressful the birthing process is and also how hard it is if you kid is ever sick or hurt. I can't imagine what Mike and his wife are going through and how this effecting every other aspect of his life.<br />
<br />
Mike has not asked for any help of any kind but I feel that as a community that we need to band together and help those in our group that need help. If he does not want what is raised, he can donate it to the Ronald McDonald House as he has said before on his blog. Mike is one of the nicest people I have talked to in this game and I hope that this helps him out some.<br />
<br />
Here are the auctions you can bid on:<br />
1. The Luke JK, Emp, 2x MJ, 2x LV and both versions of Sidious with 200 Rares/Promo/Foils that are in just the two stacks in the photo.<br />
<br />
2. Then the Rest of the Rares in the picture that are spread about. I figure there are a lot of good playable rares here that wont go as high and give those that don't have a lot to give to bid on - also comes with a 6 month Premium Membership on the PC boards.<br />
<br />
3. A 4 Rowed box full of commons/uncommons this should have a variety of everything I'm guessing, not really sure, it's from an old collection I bought that I've never really sorted or gone through - is there any interest for this? If so, we are adding it. I'll cover the shipping on the other auctions but we will need the buyer to cover this one. <br />
