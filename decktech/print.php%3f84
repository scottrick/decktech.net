In January look for a new Raw Deal site and in Febuary Magi-Nation Duel! For the players, by the players! <hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Thu Dec 6 2001 <br>Well, you all asked, and it's next LOTR.  Especially for you Andrew!  The sword incidentally is really cool.  That's what I like about David: he does things right.<hr>David said on Thu Dec 6 2001 <br>The sword is really cool, if only I can find some orcs to see if it glows.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Fri Dec 7 2001 <br>Especially for me??? WOW I feel so loved!! LOL, thanks a lot guys, once again, another great job. BTW, check out my post on the Buzz Board for the next big event :)<hr>Hayes said on Fri Dec 7 2001 <br>i don't like the 9th option.  going first isn't always synonmous with bidding the most.  in fact, i think it's prolly more important to go second.<hr>Vincent Vega said on Fri Dec 7 2001 <br>I agree, going second is huge for some decks, especially Ringwraiths and decks that want the move +1 site 2.<hr>mock said on Sun Dec 9 2001 <br>Going first can be huge in some environments.<hr>zwitter said on Mon Dec 10 2001 <br>I support Decktech in whatever, but LOTR really blows. having played in Sealed eck tourneys and pick up games, i truly dislike the game. it a pure money game with little strategy, and this is not souly due to a one set game. lotsa rares=lotsa wins. its just a matter of time before some gets 4xWitch king and 4x Cave Troll with all suppport cards deploys little moves only when forced and drops all those big ugly rare shadows on the opponent. this strat cannot be beat in my experience. some1 please prove me wrong.<hr>Hayes said on Mon Dec 10 2001 <br>i'll disagree with you jason.  i've spent about $120 (a box, a starter, 5 packs, and about $10 worth of singles) and i've managed to win the large majority of my games (i even won the first tournament i played in).  i don't know what else to tell you except that this game is much easier to get into (both learning curve wise, and financially) than SW ever was.<hr>sirens_slave said on Mon Dec 10 2001 <br>Thats the whole idea of the game, its all about tactics, thoroughly thought out tactics before and during the game. Whats the point of having rare cards like the witch king and deploying them when they`re just gonna get shot to pieces with arrows or the skirmish cancelled with something silly like hobbit stealth. Remember dont give them many twilight counters and they cant put big baddies down.   <hr>StormRider said on Tue Dec 11 2001 <br>I have played a few games in my time and Ill tell you.  Low cost hording uncommons and commons will out do a Big High costing Rare deck anytime.  Plus, dealing with shadow is all about having the right fellowship.  If I have a large juiced up party, go ahead and drop a cave troll and a Witch King, I will gun one down and take a few hits with the other, no biggie, move onto next site.  Oh and btw, I do have 4 trolls and 4 kings, Id never put them together in a deck as they dont work well together.<br>
<br>
My two cents.<br>

<hr>Rushe said on Tue Dec 11 2001 <br>This game is excellent. Ive been selling Star Wars cards since Freedom Con ended and have been buying LOTR. Its fun...Decktech is starting off with a bang...and even the most novice player has a chance to win in sealed deck with just a small basic knowledge of the game. How can you not like that. For the goofball who said its just a money game...well...tough s.hit...every game is a money game. Find me one that isnt. Card game that is. If you cant afford all the big rares...play without them or just play sealed deck until you get the rares needed to make a good deck. Its a huge set so it will take a while but concentrate on one or 2 minions and good guys. I have some complaints to but thats a whole other can of worms for another time.
