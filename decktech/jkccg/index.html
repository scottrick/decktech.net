I am going to post everything about Jedi Knights that I can Possibly
remember. It may be more or less than you already know, so please bare
with me.

Jedi Knights is gonna be HUGE! It has all the all the FUN and STRATEGY
of Star Wars: Collectable Card Game (SW:CCG) but with less complicated
mechanics. The First thing I noticed about Jedi Knights when I started
to Demo it was that this was MUCH easier than SW:CCG. Teaching Jedi
Knights is going to be very easy with the play-mat. It appeared that all
the rules are printed directly on the play-mat. After I was done asking
about game rules and other basic questions, I made way through the long
list of questions running through my mind. So right now I am going to
run off some random things that I noticed while at the NYC Demo on Feb.
10, 2001
   1.) There will be 1 common back to every card.
   2.) You will need  2 decks for a tournament (Light/Dark).
   3.) There are no non-unique Characters. Every Character is Unique.
   4.) Every Character is a warrior. Meaning, that they can use a weapon
unless otherwise stated. (R2-D2 cannot use a weapon).
   5.) There is no limit on deck size. It can be as small or as large
desired.
   6.) Every Deck will contain ONLY 4 Locations.
   7.) Every location is a 2-Sided Card. System on one side / A related
Site on the other (ie Bespin/Cloud City Guest Quarters)
   8.) Every game will be no longer than 7 turns long.
   9.) There appears to be NO cheese in this game.
  10.) There is no such thing as a force drain, It Is a completely
interactive game.


Well, 10 is good to start off with. Now, I will go through the mechanics
of the game as best I can remember.

	To Start, Each player has a "Theme" card in their deck. On every theme
card there is a "Theme-Number." This theme number is used for several
things, and will be referenced later. ( Note: "Theme" cards are
different than "Hero" cards. A Theme card is somewhat like an Objective
in SW:CCG where it represents you deck archetype )

	First, each player must have 4 Locations in their Deck. There will be 1
Tatooine, 1 Endor, 1 Bespin, and 1 Hoth in EVERY deck. the Game begins
with the person with the highest theme number. This person has a choice
on which Site He wants to deploy. he Can pick from any of His 4. Once
Player 1 Puts down his site, Player 2 must put down the matching system.
Now it is player 2's turn to put down a site. This is a very strategical
part of the game because Each site Has gametext, and each system does
not. So When a Player lays down a Site, He is Essentially taking away
that site from his opponent's Strategy. For example, I noticed that when
playing Luke seems to get a lot of bonuses while on hoth, if I as the
Dark Side lay down my Hoth then the Light has to use their Hoth card as
the System and does not get to use the gametext of his Hoth site. I
believe this relates most to Starting Effects/Interrupts in SWCCG.

	Next, Each theme card tells you how many cards you are allowed to start
with in your opening hand. I'm not sure if this is backwards or not but
I believe the Vader let you start with 7 cards and the Luke let you
start with 8 cards. Once you draw your 8 cards, you must then Search
through your Force Deck (which is a totally separate deck) and you have
to get a starting force card.

	Force Deck - ( I never got any Clear Answers on this so this is mostly
what I have determined ) The Force Deck will consist of 8 Cards. Each
Force Card has 3 Numbers Clearly marked on them: Force Number, Credits
Number, and Draw Number. I think what I was told was that every card in
your Force Deck must have a different force number (But not Sure...).

	Force cards are used in the following Manner: You pick a force card
from your force pile (NOTE: This is NOT random). You do not show your
card until your opponent has chosen his. Then you both reveal at the
same time. The player with the Higher Force Number is considered
"Player-1" and gets to go first. The Credits number is what one would
use to pay for everything. It's what we consider Force in SW:CCG. The
Draw number is the number of cards you are allowed to draw at the end of
each of your turns. Every Force Card is balanced in that It may have a
High Force Number, but the Credits and/or draw may be low...

	Once, both Players have revealed their Force cards, now it's time to
start Deploying. Player-1 (Player with highest Force Number) will begin
by deploying 1 Card. Then, Player-2 will deploy a card. this will go
back and fourth until both players pass (end Their Turn). But, a turn is
only fully over when players pass consecutively. What I mean by this is
that if Player-1 passes, then player-2 deploys a card, Then Player 1 is
given his choice again, he may deploy more now. this continues until
both players pass consecutively.

	Once all of the Deploying is done and both players have passed
consecutively, then it is time to move into the starship battle phase.
Player-1 May Now announce an attack in space or Pass. He chooses to
attack than he must Choose a card to attack with and he must choose a
target. When both have been chosen, Player-2 (the Defender) may choose
to support his ship if possible. Then Player-1 (Attacker) May then
choose to support his ship if possible. Once all the supporting has been
done, A the attacker may fire a weapon if possible or pass. Then the
defender may fire a weapon if possible. During the Weapons phase you may
also play an event Card. These seem to be like interrupt cards. they
give you some kind of bonuses via gametext. The Weapons Phase will
continue until both players pass consecutively.

	Now comes the Power Phase. Each Player Compares Power of Attacker &
Defender. The Player with the lowest power loses and is lost from the
board into the discard pile.

A few Side Notes Here...
  1.) When you draw a destiny, that card is then brought directly into
your hand... There is no recycling into your draw deck  as I've seen
thus far.
  2.) A Player may play an Event card to boost ones own power in the
power phase of a battle.
  3.) there is a special order to losing cards. If a Character/Starship
is holding a weapon then the Weapon must be placed beneath its carrier
in the discard pile.
  4.) Cards on the table, are always in 1 of 2 positions. they are
either in the Ready position or the Rotated Position. (More Later)

	The Next phase is the Blockade Phase. We Didn't get too much into this
phase since we were not playing with Capitol Starships at the demo, but
from what I can gather it Seems that a Blockade can cause a character to
be "Rotated" so he may not then either participate in a battle as a
supporter AND he may not initiate battles. This will become another
strategical part of the game. You will pay a price if you do not play
Space and Ground. Sorry for the lack of info here...

	After The Blockade Phase comes the Character Battles. Player-1 Gets to
start by either initiating a Battle or passing. If he initiates a battle
the battle will work exactly the same as a Starship battle except we
will be using characters instead of StarShips.

Now you may have read through the battle and said "What the HECK does
supporting mean???"
        Here's how I understand it. A typical situation that came up in
the demo decks was Vader, a couple of stormtroopers (TK-420, TK-522 were
some of them) and Fett(he's a weapons fiend), on the Dark Side against
Luke, R2-D2(Who is a GOD with Luke) Zev, and a couple other random
troopers (I only got to play DS, so I didn't catch their titles) on the
light side. Now, on some of the cards there was a small plus star on the
right side of the card, opposite the deploy cost. This was a leadership
icon. The Vader persona I played with had 1, Fett had one, one of the
troopers had one, Luke had 2 (better leader than Vader?) and I didn't
notice them on the other LS cards. I attack Luke with Vader. The
opponent then had the choice to support Luke with up to two other
characters there (since he had 2 leadership icons). These guys act as
bodyguards, basically like the Attack run principle, you have to shoot
the wingman before you can shoot the lead pilot, in this case, you had
to shoot the supporters before you coul shoot the main defender. So lets
say that I attacked with Vader. I signify this by turning Vader
sideways, much like tapping mana (sort of) in Magic (Ahhhh! he said
Magic!). Luke was supported by Zev and R2-D2. They are also turned
sideways. The attacker can also choose a supporter in the same manner,
in this case, I would use one of my stormtroopers who has good game text
(more on this later.) Again, turn him sideways. The supporters do NOT
add their power to the leader they're supporting, they are solely
bodyguards unless their game texts say that they add to the power. For
example, TK-507, the trooper I have supporting Vader, says that he adds
3 to the power of Vader if he is supporting him. R2-D2 says the same
(which is why he's so awesome!) but for Luke. Luke's power was a 5,
Vader's 6. So at this point in the battle, the DS is winning. Lets say
that Vader and the trooper had blaster rifles (we didn't see the Sabers
:-( ) and Luke and Zev had blaster rifles as well. The Blaster Rifle
text says that they add one to destiny if a leader firing. Fine. The
side who initiated the battle gets to go first. So since the Dark
initiated, they get first action. I choose to fire my rifle on the
trooper at R2. The little droid had a high defense, I don't remember
what, we'll call it a 3 for arguments sake. I draw destiny. A four!
Artoo is immediately lost (there is NO hit function.) Now Luke doesn't
have his power bonus! I take the destiny card into hand (Remember: All
Drawn Destinies come into owners hand). The LS player now chooses to
target my trooper, who has a defense of 2 with Luke's gun. He draws,
uh-oh, a two. Since Luke is a leader, he adds one, making it enough to
kill my trooper. Now I lose my power bonus too. Now only Zev and Luke
are left against Vader. Vader will now fire at Zev, who also has defense
2. I draw a trooper, which has a destiny of 1. I missed, but then take
the destiny into hand. Next turn, I can replace the trooper who was
shot. Zev is now going to try to fire at Vader, defense value 3. Zev
draws a 3, but since he's not a leader, no bonus, Vader is safe. I pass,
since I have no more weapons and am now winning the battle (remember,
Zev doesn't add to Luke's Power) However, the LS now plays You're All
Clear Kid! This event has some game text, but it is not applicable at
the moment. What is really important is the power bonus included to the
left of the game text. +3. (Note: You cannot use BOTH the power Bonus
and the Gametext You have to choose ONE). Now they're winning, so I play
a similar event, adding +2 to my power. We both pass, so the weapons
phase is done. Both of our powers are 8. A tie, so the tiebreaker is
determined as follows: If the Initiator (or Attacker) is a leader, tie
goes to them, if not, the tie goes to the defender. Since Vader
attacked, and is a leader, the Dark side wins. The LS now loses the
defender and ALL supporting cards. So Luke and Zev are history. If
either side still had characters at the site, they could battle again,
but all 'Rotated' characters can't initiate an attack (they can be
attacked though!). At the end of the turn, the cards are returned to the
ready position.

        Battles & Strategy: Determining Who to shoot and when To
Shootplay a Big Role in Battles. Un-like SWCCG once a person is Shot,
they are DEAD! they cannot shoot Shoot back. Also, Initiating battles
with your scrubs against his scrubs means that when you initiate against
his big players, he will have no one to support him with. This game WILL
have a lot of thinking involved!


So On to the next turn...


	After 2 Turns have been completed at a Site and it's related System
then It is time to see who "Won The Site." We now Total our entire power
at the Site (ONLY). And, if a player still has their Hero at the site at
this point, Their Total Power is DOUBLED. Whoever has more power at the
site is considered to have "Won the Site." If a player wins a site, the
site is taken and put under their Face-up Force Cards. Each Site has a
number on it indicating the Sites Values. The Number is to be show while
it under the Force Pile. This Number will be used Later (Final Battle
ONLY!).

        Once the winner of the site has been determined the site System
that was just played will be removed from the stack and we will begin
the next turn. Every 2 Turns The Winner of the site will be determined.

	Ending The Game/Final Battle: If any Player has won the first 3 Sites,
than the Game is over.  If neither player has won ALL three of the First
Sites we will move onto the Final Battle continuing by removing the
system from the stack. The Final Battle will take place on the last
planet. This battle is VERY interesting. Because this Battle will
Continue until EVERYONE on one side of the site has been removed. It's
basically a "Fight To the Death!" if at the end of the turn, characters
are still remaining on both sides of the board, The Character Battle
Phase starts over.. until EVERYTHING on one side of the board is gone.
Now if you remember before I said that a Site that was won gets stacked
under your force Pile. This site has a number on it and this number will
get added to your CREDITS. So During the Final Battle you will have lots
of credits to play with. I am sure these will be greatly needed!  There
will be a LOT of tech being used in preparing for this battle.



NOTES: Here are a few things I've noticed or want to comment on.
  1.) I am not sure how the games are scored. I am assuming that you'll
probably get Victory points and possibly a differential score determined
by the amount of power you had at the end of the Final Battle.
  2.) It seems like your opponent cards CAN get mixed up with your cards
and this may cause a Problem. Since there are common backs, and no
"inserts" that I noticed hopefully they may allow the use of Opaque
backs which will help keep your decks separated.
  3.) I also Noticed that there are several cards that can be played
either Dark OR light Decks. If you've noticed at the top of the cards
the Destiny Number is on top of a picture of either, an Imperial, Rebel,
or Independent symbols. Cards with Independent Symbols may go in either
a Light Or Dark Deck. Most weapons are called "typical" which is there
way of saying Non-Unique and can be used for either Dark or Light Decks.
So basically A Blaster Rifle is the Same For Light Or Dark.


Well thats it for now, We hope you all Have Enjoyed!
