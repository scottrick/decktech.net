An independent non-participating panel of experts will judge the top ten member rated decks and articles on June 18th. Decks will be judged on many factors including: deck synergy, effectiveness, creativity, and depth of strategy/explanation.

<B>How can you help pick the winner?</B><br>
The judges will select the winners from the top 10 member-rated submissions. By rating decks and articles you are telling the judges which submissions you think are the best. So get to it. Not only can you help pick the winner, you earn tech points for each review you give. Those tech points can be spent on acquiring Jedi skills and weapons at the DeckTech Jedi Academy, coming soon.<br>

Cool.<hr>Chris McLaren said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>What happens with ties in the ten spot?<hr>Nathan Friedman said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Awesome<hr>sean miller said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>AOTC sucks, it is an inferior game and anyone can play it. HAIL SWCCG, I vow to never play AOTC, hasbro/wotc will get none of my support. I recommend you players try SWCCG and actually play something that requires thought.<br>

Tyrpotix<hr>Tommy Engvik said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>Will the judges rate the top 10 advanced decks, or just the decks on the top 10 list? Reason I'm asking is because there might be some beginner decks on the top 10 list when the contest ends.
