I haven't played in a couple of years.  That has to be good for one win eh?  Just kidding.  Hope to see some of the old players.  I know that 3 of us old-timers are going.<hr>Mighty Jalapeno said on Sun Nov 19 2006 <br>I have nowhere else to post this.... why does info@decktech.net not exist, along with decktech@decktech.net and every other e-mail address on this site? It's REALLY hard to ask you guys questions if you don't let us know your e-mail address.<hr>Alexandre Boulay said on Tue Nov 28 2006 <br>I want my name removed from this website. However all my requests with emails bounce back, what am i supposed to do??
