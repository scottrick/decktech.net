Great work, Canada and Quebec really came through.<br>
<br>
With the reports and wrap ups starting to roll in, let's be sure to congratulate all our buddies on DT here who qualified and succeeded at the Championships this past weekend.  Out of the top 16 for Day 3, I head count 11 as being active DTers (including one I keep kicking off), and I want you all to congratulate these champs for the hard work and effort and ability that goes in to competing on that level.  Check out their reports, decks, and make sure to let 'em know how proud you are of the work they've done.<br>
<br>
I also want to personally congratulate out of the top 4 my two great buddies on here from Star Wars ccg.  <br>
<br>
DeckTech Admin and one man British Invasion <b>Alex "Greedo" Tennent</b> for his always amazing and creative deck design and play.  How this person has influenced my speech patterns and slang I can not even begin to intimate.<br>
<br>
The stud so good we named the site after him, my crazy fellow punker <b>Dominic "Decktech" Gaudreault</b>.  I hope you gave the finger to everyone in your acceptance award.<br>
<br>
Great work to you all!<br>

Top 16 but instant scrub = ah well.

I have played SWCCG and LOTR (and many other games) with him for almost 5 years and I have never seen someone such skilled as Mat. LOTR could not have better world champion! <br>
