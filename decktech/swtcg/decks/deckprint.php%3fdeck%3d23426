It will take quite an effort by the opponent to get past this opposition, allowing you to take the other two arenas.  <br>
<br>
In space, take full advantage of Master & Apprentice and the critical hit capability on the Bravo N-1s.  Anakin&#39;s Inspiration can help you gun the opponent&#39;s fleet down with minimal casualties.  <br>
<br>
Naboo Cruiser lacks the bombardment ability and slightly higher speed of the Republic Assault Ship, but most DS units attack faster than the latter ship, anyway.  And the lower cost helps in setup, where even putting a card down with 1 counter on it lets me draw a card.  Also, there is twice the likelihood of a die roll high enough to build it in a single turn after setup.<br>
<br>
Use the Star Shuttles to draw whenever they are not needed as attackers.  <br>
<br>
There are only a couple Elite Jedi Squads in here because they are very vulnerable units.  Running more than a couple, I&#39;d depend on Luxury Airspeeder or Anakin&#39;s Inspiration to kepe them alive long enough to attack.  I want the units in here to stand or fall on their own before supporting cards come into play.  <br>
<br>
Republic Attack Gunship because I&#39;m still rounding up AT-TEs, and I want this deck to be consistent for now.  The gunships are not only very cool in the movie, they&#39;re good enough in the TCG that I&#39;m not in a terrible rush to replace them.  <br>
<br>
Plo Koon and Shaak Ti are just in there to provide some additional attacks against someone trying to stall me out with a bunch of weak units in the character arena.  <br>
<br>
It will often be worthwhile to tap Yoda B for 1 force in your build step.  Particularly if you can make good use of a High-Force Dodge in another arena, or deliver a stunning knockout blow with Anakin&#39;s Inspiration and Master and Apprentice this turn.  <br>
<br>
Try it out for yourself, and have fun.<br>
