<br>
Characters<br>
There are 6 different characters in this deck:<br>
Obi Wan Kenobi (B)<br>
Anakin Skywalker (B)<br>
Padme&#39; Amidala (A)<br>
Yoda (B)<br>
Shaak Ti <br>
Bail Organa<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t play stacks of any of the characters, the reason for this is because I want to draw specific characters, not the cheap, easily killed characters, or the expensive, hard to deploy units, I want moderate cost, durable units. Padme&#39; is in there to give all Jedi units +10 speed and help out Anakin. Anakin is in there because he has 60 speed and power 5. Obi is in there because of his critical hit abilities. Yoda is in there because he is a evasive machine. He can evade up to 6 damage if you have enough force (with 2 deflecting).Shaak Ti is in there decause of her high defense and speed for a measly 4 build. Bail Organa is in there to try to make them lose force or tap a unit, both are very usefull.<br>
<br>
Ground<br>
I play the 4 following ground units:<br>
At-Te Walker 23X<br>
Elite Jedi Squad<br>
Luxury Airspeeder<br>
Jawa Sandcrawler<br>
<br>
The Walkers are godly. They can potentially deal 7 points of damage and they have a speed of 50! I play with the Elite Jedi because of their critical hit abilities, plus they gain 10 speed from Padme&#39;. The Luxury Airspeeders are in the deck because they are fairly cheap and also add 10 speed to the other ground units. I play with the Jawa Sandcrawlers because the draw cards and have a 7 defense for only 4 build points!<br>
<br>
Space<br>
I have 5 different space units in my deck:<br>
Republic Assualt Ship<br>
Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter<br>
Naboo Fighter Squadron<br>
Jedi Starfighter 3R3<br>
Bravo N-1 Starfighter<br>
<br>
The Assault ships are usefull! They have 6 power and 7 defense, not too bad for 7 build, but they have the bombard ability, which allows them to attack ground units in the ground arena!Obi Wan&#39;s Starfighter is one tight ship, it gets a bonus from Padme&#39;, has Critical hit 2 and can heal itself! The Jedi R3R&#39;s are in there because of their 50 speed as well as the three build cost for 3 power and defense, again, they too get a bonus from Padme.The Bravo Fighters are in there because of their cost, as well as their critical hit. The Naboo Squads are in there for their power, cost and durability,<br>
<br>
Battle<br>
I play with 3 different battle cards:<br>
Anakin&#39;s Insperation<br>
Ward of the Jedi<br>
Windu&#39;s Solution<br>
<br>
Anakin&#39;s Insperation allows your units in an arena to fight super fast, most of the time allowing my units to attack all before my opponent. Windu&#39;s Solution gives a unit 30 more speed and 2 more power, allowing faster, more efficient units.Ward of the Jedi is in there to protect key units from destruction.<br>
<br>
Mission<br>
I play with two different mission cards:<br>
Wedding of Destiny<br>
Jedi Council Summons<br>
<br>
Both allow me to gain more cards as well as force.<br>
<br>
Overall, my deck relies on speed, and cost effiecint units to overwhelm my opponent. Let me know what you think as well as any comments, thanks for your time! <br>
