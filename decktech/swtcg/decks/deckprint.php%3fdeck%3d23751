This deck is the opponent of the other no rare deck I have posted play them and see who will win lol its a good match.  Same thing applies here dont tell me to put a rare in I dont want to hear it.<br>
  During setup drop the Control Ship in the space arena it gives your droids +10 speed which is key in this deck.  In the ground arena drop a lux speed and a destroyer droid it is speed 60 now if you have the ladder of the last wo cards out, very lethal fighting machine.  In the ground drop a Super droid it will have speed +20 in the game very mean and nasty same as the P series (but, it can have speed +40 now that becomes nasty as hell.).<br>
  Character Arena.  Drop the two big droids during setup for the quick hit and kill maneuver.  During the game Watto is there to heal droids and speeders and fighter can come in handy, if opponet gets tired of your healing units him or her is going to have to divert power to attack him which means my big stuff can hit without being targeted could come in handy. Nexu all character abilies are plus 1 force could come in handy in combat.  Tyranus is still mean without the A version he can get a critical hit:2 and evade 3. While jango is power +2 when fighting a jedi very nice.<br>
  Ground Arena:  Speeders are fun even though they get targeted by down in flames( well with me Capturing obi that could present a problem and also slumming around on Coruscant helps two.).  The lux is there for the +10 speed it gives. Recon speeder are fun with the shields they last awhile down on the ground when you get them out.  Destroyer are the main killers in this deck hitting first and hard. Walking droids are cheap and have power 6 and might get +20 speed making them 40 very nice.  Reek is for alittle card draw ,but still fast and pesteres opponent.<br>
  Space Arena: Mix between power and swarm.  The fighters are there to swarm hard and fast knocking things out of space.  Control ships aid droids by giving 10 more speed.  The battleship are high health and can bombard ground units very nice.<br>
  Battle Cards:  Hero&#39;s dodge to help prevent damge in the character arena.  Pilots dodge to help in the ground or space it helps alot.<br>
  Mission Card: This is the area which comes in handy.  Capture takes force away and gives it to you very good (In the character arena opponent if a Nexu is there they got to pay that extra force that Capture might of stole.).  Splinter is in here to get things arolling in whichever arena you feel comfortable in.  Slumming help prevent Down in Flames (Or opponent pulling off Wedding or you just name it.) it will help you in the long run.<br>
  With this deck just have fun and you never know it might beat a jedi mains and toys I can dream right lol. May the force be with you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
