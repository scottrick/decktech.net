1. Introduction<br>
<br>
&#8220;As my first act, I will create a great army to counter the threat of the increasing Seperatists.&#8221; &#8211; Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<br>
<br>
Looking at the list of decks I&#8217;ve made, I suddenly realize that I haven&#8217;t built a clone deck yet. I scream with the usual falsetto voice. Not building a clone deck, what have I been thinking? These hordes of white warriors crush everything that stands in their way. They are the endless army of the mighty Republic. And I haven&#8217;t built a clone deck yet. Breaking free from my prison of panic, I sit down and think. A clone deck is to be made. Now, some days after, it has. Been made, that is.<br>
<br>
Since there are only 180 cards in the SWTCG base set, there aren&#8217;t an overwhelming amount of deck types and strategies. You might have seen this deck type before (who hasn&#8217;t?). Still, I&#8217;ve tried to add some new twists and turns and bells and whistles and whatnot to make this deck more than just a standard clone deck.<br>
<br>
A small explanation of the deck&#8217;s title: The clone warriors are anonymous people who all dress the same. They&#8217;re also very cool. Except the colour of their outfits, they have a striking resemblance with the Men in Black. Instead of fighting aliens on Earth, the clones bravely fight droids, bounty hunters, Sith and Geonosians in a galaxy far, far away. They&#8217;re bad. They have mad skills. They are the Clones. Prepare to reap the whirlwind, Dooku.<br>
<br>
Oh, and enjoy :)<br>
<br>
2. Overview<br>
<br>
The two clone agents 5/373 and 4/163 are on a mission to save the galaxy. Teaming up with the Officer, they load up their guns and get ready to kill some droids.<br>
<br>
This deck takes some standard units (Clone Warriors, Clone Platoons), and turns them into combat monsters using their leaders and creators (Clone Officer, Lama Su, Taun We). Since the clones don&#8217;t have any space units yet, the space arena consists of fast and cheap starfighters. There are also some who have joined the Clones in their struggle on the ground and character arena (Chancellor Palpatine, R2-D2, Elite Jedi Squad). By combining all these units together with some Battle and Mission cards, the deck is efficiently and quickly able to swarm and kill your opponent.<br>
<br>
There is one thing I have to explain: The few battle and (especially) mission cards. This deck is about swarming and getting lots of units. Even though you can mulligan before setup, there is a chance you will end up with lots of battle and mission cards and very few units. I always like to play with lots of units, to ensure that I get them when I want to. <br>
<br>
You will see that there are only 3 damage prevention cards (and Mending). How could this be? I attack first in most arenas (sometimes excluding character), and by the time my opponent attacks there isn&#8217;t much left to attack with. Also, one unit is not that important, since I usually have new ones waiting to be built. I have 4 of every important card in the deck. Try to play with the deck a couple of times, and you will see that there is enough damage prevention to go around.<br>
<br>
Why aren&#8217;t there more copies of Lama Su? First, his ability doesn&#8217;t work during Setup. Also, how much are you really saving? Let&#8217;s do some calculating. Lama Su costs 4. That&#8217;s 4 precious build points that could have been used for a Clone Warrior or a Clone Platoon. Since Lama lowers the BP cost of every clone with one, we see that you have to play five units to actually benefit from Lama. The cost of Lama and 4 Clone Platoons are 4 + (4*3) = 16, while the cost of 4 Clone Platoons is 16. If you play any fewer units, you will be better off with just playing another clone. Since games often don&#8217;t last too long, and since Lama is often the #1 target when he enters the character arena, I have chosen to include only 1 of the long-necked alien.<br>
<br>
Character: <br>
<br>
The core units in this arena are the Clone Officers and Warriors. The rest of the character units are back-up units (Lama Su, Taun We, Chancellor Palpatine), designed to help your core units or to help your units somewhere else (R2-D2). It&#8217;s as easy as playing cheap characters and then boosting them.<br>
<br>
Ground: <br>
<br>
By combining speed with extraordinary offensive capabilities, the ground units should easily destroy even the heaviest defence. The AT-TEs are the beasts of the deck, power 5 and critical hit 2. Another cheap, but good, unit is the Elite Jedi Squad. Also featured is the Clone Platoon, a unit that often is power 5 or 6 for the cost of 4. Luxury Airspeeders runs the show from behind, and makes sure that all the units attack first.<br>
<br>
Space:<br>
<br>
Since there aren&#8217;t any clone ships, we have to win the space arena with starfighters. Lots of starfighters. This is starfighter swarm at its best: Cheap units with good offensive capabilities. Combined with R2-D2 (tap to give each starfighter Critical Hit 1), the horde of gleaming starships is able to destroy most of the opponent&#8217;s units.<br>
<br>
Battle:<br>
<br>
The battle cards have versatility; they can be used in every arena. The cards provide speed (Anakin&#8217;s Inspiration), Power (Master and Apprentice) and damage prevention (Yoda&#8217;s Intervention). All you need, really.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mission: <br>
<br>
Since this deck is about swarming, there are only two mission cards included. Yes, there are a lot of good mission cards, but there are also a lot of good units :). More is explained below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Card choices<br>
<br>
Here you will find the reason why I&#8217;ve included the cards in the deck, and some facts about them<br>
<br>
Character (17 cards):<br>
<br>
Clone Officer x 4<br>
The core of every clone deck, this excellent unit raises the power of every single clone by one. Look at the Officer&#8217;s stats. They&#8217;re 40/5/4, right? Not exactly. What some people don&#8217;t remember is that the Clone Officer also boosts himself. A 40/6/4 unit with a great ability for just five build points is a deal for me.<br>
<br>
Clone Warrior 4/163 x 4<br>
The big brother of 5/373, the friendly Clone Warrior 4/163 is very handy to have around. For only four build points you get a 40/4/4 unit, which can be boosted as high as 50/8/4 (though 50/6/4 sounds more likely). With enough of these, your opponent&#8217;s characters will eventually fall.<br>
<br>
Clone Warrior 5/373 x 4<br>
A 40/3/3 unit, the 5/373 is very good when you consider the low cost of three. Since these clones costs so little, expect to see two or three in the character arena at the same time. If one unit gets discarded, this doesn&#8217;t hamper your plans that much. There is more where that came from (Kamino).<br>
<br>
Taun We (A) x 2<br>
One of the strangest beings in the Star Wars galaxy. Taun We provides all your clones (including the Clone Platoon) with +10 speed. Combined with Anakin&#8217;s Inspiration (and Chancellor Palpatine), your clones will be quicker than a really quick guy (which is indeed quick). Taun is also very cheap, only two for 20/2/3. Speed is very important in this game; therefore I have 2 copies in this deck.<br>
<br>
Lama Su (A) x 1<br>
Some use as many as three of this unit, which I find a bit too much. Lama costs 4, with stats of 20/3/3. His ability is (as mentioned above) that as long as he is in the character arena, each clone costs 1 less to build. This is indeed a very nice, but I have chosen to use only 1 copy. To know why, see Overview.<br>
<br>
R2-D2 (A) x 1<br>
This little guy does a lot. R2-D2 is a very charismatic droid, and some of that charisma is used on your starfighters. After tangling with their aiming systems, R2 can tap in the build step to make each starfighter critical hit 1. Every single starfighter you have in the space arena, and that number is probably high. R2 can turn the game around for you, ensuring a victory in the space arena.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chancellor Palpatine (A) x 1<br>
Though he is evil incarnated, the peace-loving Palpatine still fights for his beloved Republic. He does what he&#8217;s best at: Politics. By having Palpatine in the character arena, all your opponent&#8217;s characters get &#8211;10 speed. He&#8217;s not a terrible fighter, either. For a cost of 4, you get a 30/4/4 unit, able to take some beatings before going down.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ground (16 cards):<br>
<br>
AT-TE Walker 23X x 4<br>
The Beast of the character arena. After seeing how good this unit it, I can&#8217;t wait to see the AT-AT :). The stats say it all, really. The AT-TE Walker 23X costs 6 build points. While this may seem much, you are getting a 50/5/4 unit with critical hit 2. It is that critical hit that makes this unit so good. When rolling 5 dice, the chances of getting at least 1 six are (1-((5/6)^5))) 60%. If you get out one or two AT-TEs, you will soon be dominating the ground arena.<br>
<br>
Elite Jedi Squad x 4<br>
The Jedi are fighting side-by-side with their clone buddies, and well too. This unit only costs three build points, and for that you get a 40/3/2 unit. This unit also has critical hit 2, and though the chances of rolling a six are slimmer (42%) you get a fast and good unit that is able to finish off what the Walkers couldn&#8217;t.<br>
<br>
Luxury Airspeeder x 4<br>
A must in any deck that attacks first, these speeders fly through the streets as if there was no tomorrow. By having a base speed of 60 and the extremely useful ability of giving every other ground unit +10 speed (including other Luxury Airspeeders), these speeders can help you turn the game to the better. With a power and health of 2, the Airspeeders might also be able to hit something.<br>
<br>
Clone Platoon x 4<br>
Of course they&#8217;re here, the large white fields of people that consume anything in their way. Costing four build points, this 40/4/4 unit is a bargain considering all the pumping it can receive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Space (16 cards):<br>
<br>
Bravo N-1 Starfighter x 4<br>
These starfighters are some of the best in the game. For the low, low cost of three, you get a 50/3/3 unit with critical hit 1. A deal if you ask me. By having two of these ships out and playing Master and Apprentice, you get one of the most potent combos around able to knock out even the biggest ships.<br>
<br>
Jedi Starfighter 3R3 x 4<br>
In space as in ground, the Jedi are helping out the clones as best as possible. For three builds point you get a 50/3/3 unit. Very good.<br>
<br>
N-1 Starfighter x 4<br>
We all remember these little needles from Episode 1, where they get to show how much they really sucked. In the card game, things are a bit different. This is the fastest space unit in the game, only tied with Tyranus&#39;s Solar Sailer. They&#39;re cheap, and they do their job well (much like the clones).<br>
<br>
Naboo Starfighter Squadron x 3<br>
4 build points: 40/4/4. Good.<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter (A) x 1<br>
Not only is Obi-Wan a good swordsman, he also knows how to pilot. Though claiming that he hates flyng, his starfighter is certainly one of the best ships in the game. It costs 4, has 50/3/3, critical hit 2 and self-healing. What&#8217;s not to like?<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle (9 cards):<br>
<br>
Anakin&#39;s Inspiration x 3<br>
You live and die by this card. For just 2 force, every single unit in an arena get +20 until end of battle. Anakin&#8217;s Inspiration is one of the best Light Side battle cards, and a card that will win you some games. Remember, play it where it&#39;s needed the most, at the right time, and things will change to the better.<br>
<br>
Master and Apprentice x 3<br>
Another excellent card in a swarm deck, this card provides 2 of your units with +2 power until end of battle. A very, very good card. Firstly because of it&#39;s cheapness, secondly because it can be used everywhere. A good combo is to use this card on units with critical hit.<br>
<br>
Yoda&#39;s Intervention x 3<br>
The damage prevention card. Cheap. Good. For more about this card, see Overview.<br>
<br>
Mission (2 cards):<br>
<br>
Mending x 1<br>
Since I don&#8217;t have any evade or deflect abilities, this card is included to give a character unit some health back.<br>
<br>
Wedding of Destiny x 1<br>
This deck is able to play a lot of units, and this card enables you to get those units. Drawing three cards and gaining +1 force is very good for 2 cost. The force generation will help you play more battle cards (5 force = Anakin&#8217;s Inspiration + Master and Apprentice/Yoda&#8217;s Intervention).<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
A barren wasteland comes to view. On the ground lie several groups of dead battle droids, killed by the never-ending gunfire of the Clone Army. Beside a cliff, Count Dooku and Jango Fett view the arena with sadness, knowing that the failure is a fact. The Clones have won the battle, and soon they will win the war. Onwards, clones!<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and attention. I hope that you know how this deck works, and the reason I have chosen the cards I have chosen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
