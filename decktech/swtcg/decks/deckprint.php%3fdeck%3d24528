This is my deck idea whn the set is release to the public so this will be my deck after some meta.<br>
  Character Rundown:(15)<br>
 Aurra Sing (As in all game broken.) Build 6 5p/5h/50sp. Treated as a Dark Jedi.  When she dameges a jedi so that it is discarded she can untap which in my opionon is the greatest thing ever since this deck has force choke to stop evasions.  Pay 2 force to deflect1 which can come in handy.<br>
 Darth Maul(c): can stop oppoents evasion by paying 3 force always a great hing to stop jedi evade.<br>
 Darth Maul(b): is speed 60 with6p/4h I use him to stack.<br>
 Darth Maul(d): has stun 2 so when you damage a unit their power is reduced by 2.<br>
 Jango (a,b.c.e)  He makes jedi -3 power when attackinh him on the (e) version.<br>
 Nute(b) add +1 to your build and San Hill add +2 to your build so you can be +3 build which is always a great thing to do.<br>
 So in the character arena Aurra is great because if she discards a Jedi she can fight again which is always good.  Maul is awesome preventing evasion of opponent.  Jango anti-jedi.  And the two diplomats to add to your build points.<br>
 <br>
  Ground:(14)<br>
 DD:  a 5,5 always a good thing to have around.<br>
 Hailfire droid build 6 speed 40 5p/6h with stun 3 the new destroyer droid in my view.<br>
 Super Squad:  a 5p/6h unit with speed 30 always a + to have for backup.<br>
 Lux Speeder: Same stratr as old adds to the speed of ground units.<br>
 Rundown heavy power with high health should win this arena.<br>
<br>
  Space:(12)<br>
 Slave 1 (a & B): First ship that you can stack now that neat. (b) had stun3 and speed 50 5p/4h so it a monster win stacked. speed 60 6p/5h for a ship. Just drop a powerdive and have fun.<br>
 Solar Sailor:  this is a great combo powerdive+clever escape attack 3 times before opponent can then retreat can we all say broken like a mofo.<br>
 Inflitrator: pay 2 force when discarded to take it back into hand so that could always come in handy.<br>
 IG Ship and Commerce Cruser: Decent power with shields and high health.<br>
  Solar sailor strat + Slave 1 = win in this arena.<br>
<br>
  Battle Cards:<br>
 Trade Fed Offensice pay 4 choose ground or space each of your units in that arena are speed +30.  This will aid you so that your droids in the ground attack quicker and deal damage before opponent and in the space furhter the use or the tri-attack.<br>
 DArk Speed: Speed +30. <br>
 Strenght of Hate: pay 2 power +3 is always nice use this with aurra so that she can untap if fighting jedis.<br>
 Power dive and Clever Escape:  Attack again shall we.<br>
<br>
  Mission Cards:<br>
  FORCE CHOKE FORCE CHOKE FORCE CHOKE.<br>
 Maul&#39;s strat is awesome.  I gain 2 forc opponent lose 2 then if maul is in the character arena you gain another force great great card also your opponent loses anothe force so if maul is fighting in the character arena you drop this and you gain 3 force opponent loses 3 force.<br>
 Capture +2 force -2 for opponent.<br>
 DR: lose of 7 force to opponent.<br>
 <br>
 Force choke and the mini strat in this deck when it comed together will destroy all in you wake.  May the force be choked always from the Jedi Scum. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
