As you can see from the decklist, the deck concentrates quite heavily on the space arena, applying more units there than anywhere else.  The Squadrons and Wings are the most cost-efficient non-unique starfighters the dark side has available.  The Solar Sailer speaks for itself, and nearly all players should recognize its power.  the Intergalactic Banking Clan Starship is one of the best non-unique ships in the game.  With 5 health and shields, that unit is one tough nut to crack, meaning that your opponent will consistently attack your droid starfighters and the bombing ships instead.  So the Banking Clan ship will just keep throwing its 4 dice every single turn, and it absolutely will not stop until they are dead!  Since you concentrate so heavily on space, the battleships are designed to take advantage of your dominance in the stars.  Bombard 4 is not to be trifled with, and can make short work of those luxury airspeeders or elite jedi squads.  Even the Crit 2 walkers won&#39;t last forever.  The War Freighter has excellent versatility.  7 health makes it hard to take down, and a 5-die attack is not to be scoffed at.  Once it has helped you take the space arena, it can assist (or even lead, if necessary) the bombardment of the surface.  The varied mix of starships ensures that you will usually have the right combination for the situation during setup.  If you&#39;re being left relatively uncontested in space, then the battleships are your best bet.  If you expect a lot of space combat, then the Intergalactic Banking Clan ships can step in.  Meanwhile, the War Freighter is great either way, and the Solar Sailer makes a good deterrant if your opponent was thinking about coming at you with a few N-1s that they can build later, if they came up short on ships during setup.  <br>
<br>
Ground:<br>
The Destroyer Droid Squad is the single best DS ground unit in the game.  The Airspeeders help them attack faster, hopefully ahead of those annoying gunships and elite jedi squads.  the Geonosian Defense Platform is a force to be reckoned with, but no unit in the game says &quot;back off&quot; quite like the Battleship Core.  If you get one of the cores, you might be able to drop it by itself during setup.  Or you might try 2 destroyer droids, or a platform and an airspeeder.  All of these cost 1/3 or less of your total setup points, ensuring that you&#39;ll have plenty of options in the other 2 arenas.  Obviously, you can apply more of your setup points to the other 2 arenas, and use build points on ground units for the first couple turns, if you&#39;ve happened to draw into your copies of &quot;Peace on Naboo&quot;.  The ground units are mainly about survivability.  Bring enough health to make yourself difficult to kill, but bring enough power to kill opposing units, so that your opponent will have to reinforce in order to finish you off.  (the bombardment greatly assists in that goal, and the more points your opponent spends building replacement units in the ground arena, the better chance you have of taking Character arena)  With any luck, that will enable you to overwhelm them in the other 2 arenas.  Taking the ground arena is certainly not out of the question, but it wouldn&#39;t be your primary objective in most games.  <br>
<br>
Character:<br>
Although the deck is heavily weighed toward dominating space, it is amazingly effective in the Character arena.  Most everyone knows that Tyranus and Jango are the most brutal units that Dark can bring to the Character arena.  Stacked up, they can deal staggering amounts of damage, and the multiple copies of Tyranus&#39; Gift can make Jango Fett surprisingly resilient.  Needless to say, they won&#39;t get many chances to kill him when you are throwing so many dice on every attack.  So what gives this deck such a huge advantage over other dark decks that use Tyranus and Jango stacks in the character arena?  Well that is very simple.  His name is DARTH VADER.  There&#39;s no doubt that Anakin Skywalker is the heart and soul of the character arena for light side.  Obi-wan and padme are both good characters, but they also both have versions that assist Anakin.  And in my opinion, those &quot;Anakin helper&quot; versions are the best versions of Padme and Obi-Wan.  Yoda is a house, no doubts there, but every light deck uses plenty of other characters in the personal combat arena, and Anakin is almost ALWAYS among them.  So, if we know that Anakin is the centerpiece of the light side character assortment, this makes DARTH VADER a tremendous threat to the light side.  (just ask the rebellion)  By bringing Vader into the personal combat arena, you can strip the light side of their single best character (anakin) and eliminate the &quot;helper&quot; text of his closest companions.  Because if Vader and Anakin are both in the character arena when the battle phase starts, they become &quot;contested units&quot;, and the bidding begins.  Rules for this are included in the rulebook.  Basically you bid force and add your character&#39;s build cost, and the highest total wins.  their character stays, the other one retreats.  But dark side wins ties.  Advantage:  Vader.  And Vader&#39;s build cost is higher than 3 out of 4 versions of Anakin.  Advantage:  Vader.  How many times do you see Anakin and Padme or Anakin and Obi-Wan holding down the personal combat arena for light side?  OFTEN, I bet.  But if Vader shows up, and makes Anakin retreat, then he and Tyranus (or he and Jango) can murder Obi or Padme (whichever happens to be there) and claim the arena.  This will often win you the game outright, because although anakin is still &quot;around&quot;, he&#39;s retreated, and hence you control the arena.  So if you&#39;ve destroyed your opponent in either of the two arenas, OR if they have retreated in either of those arenas, you win the game.  And all thanks to this one extraordinary card, DARTH VADER.  Cheesy?  Perhaps.  But frighteningly effective.  Vader can win many games that would otherwise be lost.  And what if your opponent doesn&#39;t put out Anakin at all anyway?  Well, never fear.  Vader is a beatdown machine in his own right.  Since the card is so incredibly difficult to obtain, I will post his info here, for those of you that might never have seen the card.  <br>
<br>
DARTH VADER<br>
Build Cost: 6<br>
Speed: 40<br>
Power: 6<br>
Health: 5<br>
Abilities:  <br>
Pay 2 force - Vader gets +2 power for this attack<br>
Pay 3 force - Evade 3<br>

Not bad, eh?  So whether or not Vader shoves Anakin out of the character arena first, you can be sure that he&#39;s gonna make some heads roll once he shows up.  (unless Anakin was the only character they had there, then you just win I guess.  hehe)  At this point, some of you might be wondering how I have 3 Vaders.  But that&#39;s quite simple.  When Wizards of the Coast flew 7 SWCCG players into Seattle to test out their new Star Wars game, I was among those 7.  All 7 of us were given the Darth Vader promo card, and were informed that it would be tournament legal (which it is) even though the first set with Vader in it would not be released until much later.  So that&#39;s how I got one.  I then traded for 2 others, from the remaining 6 people who made the trip, and now own three.  Nice.  :)  You may ask &quot;why no Jango Fett A for the stack?&quot;  Well...I don&#39;t HAVE a Jango Fett A, which is why I need to win that autographed one in this darn contest!  :)  <br>

Mission cards:<br>
This deck uses all 3 of the cards that repair damage to your units.  Return to spaceport is great for removing 4 damage counters from your geonosian platform, battleship core, or even a badly damaged destroyer droid squad.  Starship refit does the same thing for your bombardment ships or your Intergalactic Banking Clan starship (which wasn&#39;t easy to get 4 damage counters onto in the first place, I&#39;ll wager!) and mending can be used to patch up wounds on Vader, Tyranus, or even Jango Fett.  And it gives you 1 force!  Bonus!  The 2 copies of capture obi-wan just make it easier for you to use your force abilities and battle cards, while making it tougher for your opponent to do the same.  These cards also just go further to ensure that you win the force bid if Vader and Anakin become contested.  <br>
<br>
Battle Cards:<br>
Dark Speed is very nice in any arena.  When vader attacks with 70 speed and 8 dice, jedi start to fall.  A geonosian defense platform that attacks before a crit 2 walker can swing a game, as can a battleship core that attacks before a republic gunship.  In space, it can be handy to bump the war freighter up to 60 speed so it can drop an annoying crit 1 bravo starfighter before it even attacks.  You might even be able to take down obi-wan&#39;s starfighter before it gets a turn, using this same card.  Strength of Hate speaks for itself, and is just plain awesome.  Peace on Naboo ties in perfectly with your &quot;survive on ground until I can bombard them&quot; strategy.  Tyranus&#39; gift, like dark speed, can be great in any of the 3 arenas.  If obi&#39;s starfighter is being helped up to 5 power and crit 2 by master & apprentice, just make him 0 power.  same thing goes for those annoying crit 2 walkers.  Or just use it on Obi-Wan or Plo Koon to keep Jango from taking a big hit.  Excellent, versatile card.  Pilot&#39;s dodge can help you last longer on the ground arena, or protect your slower starships so that they can return fire and clean up in space.  Lull in the Fighting is a really tech card for this deck.  If, for any reason, you cannot outbid the light player for the contestation between Vader and Anakin, then try to get the bid as high as you can, and then once you lose, they pay a bunch of force and Vader has to retreat.  This might leave Jango or Tyranus in a bad situation, staring down Anakin and possibly a friend, too.  So just play the Lull and there&#39;s no damage in the character arena.  Now that your opponent just paid off that bid to make Vader retreat for a turn, you&#39;ll most definitely have enough force to win the bid next turn.  So Vader steps in, Anakin backs off, and either you have control of the arena now, or Anakin&#39;s pal(s) are in a world of hurt.  Either way, good for you, bad for them.  Target locked is big fun with any card that already has decent power and a critical hit (like Jango Fett B or Tyranus B) or just has really huge power (like the Battleship Core)  If you have Tyranus B and play target locked on him, he is now Critical 4.  Assuming 3 hits on 6 dice, and 1 six out of 6 dice, that&#39;s an average of 7 damage.  So even if Obi, or Kit fisto, or Plo Koon evade 2, they still take 5, and die.  Mean.<br>
<br>
All in all, a beastly deck.  And the inclusion of 3 copies of DARTH VADER probably make it the closest thing to a &quot;broken&quot; deck that I&#39;ve seen yet.  By the time Darth Vader actually comes out in normal packs, the light side will have all sorts of other options in the character arena.  Mace Windu, Qui-Gon Jinn, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and who knows what else.  But right now, Anakin is the big gun for light side.  So when Anakin falls prey to &quot;the Corruption&quot;, and turns to the dark side...well...key up the Imperial March, and let the light side pray for better days </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font class="bfont"> <a href="/swtcg/decks/decks.php">Back to Decks Directory</a> | <A HREF="/swtcg/decks/decks.php?reviews=23868"> Read Reviews </A> | <a href="deckprint.php?deck=23868" TARGET="BLANK_"> Printer Friendly</a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="review"></a><font class="h2font">In order to review decks you must be a registered member. <A href="/swtcg/main/join.php">Sign up for free!</A></font></td></tr></table>
