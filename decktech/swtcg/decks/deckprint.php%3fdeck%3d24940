The Anakin cards give you versatility in building a stack and all the versions of Mace are powerful either stacked or by themselves. The Clones help support the two Jedi and provide cheap power for the arena Use Jedi Council Summons, Wedding of Destiny and the card drawing abilities of the Star Shuttles to help build your stacks or replenish your Clones in the arena. Padme (A) can support Anakin and your other Jedi and if you have Padme (E) stacked underneath her, you can reorganize the stack for free during the build phase, allowing your characters to deploy for one less and then put the (A) version back on top to give the boost to the Jedi.<br>
<br>
Ground Arena - A single Luxury Airspeeder will make most of the units in this deck faster than Dark Side ground units. The two different shield walkers and Jedi Heroes can stick around for a turn or two and help hold the arena while the critical hit walkers and Elite Jedi Squads can deal out the damage. Consider using Master & Apprentice or Windu&#39;s Solution on your critical hit units to increase their chances of causing more damage.<br>
<br>
Space Arena - Much like the ground arena, a mix of fast units and heavy units. Senatorial Cruisers and Star Shuttles can help hold the arena. The Star Shuttles give you much needed card drawing abilities and for this reason will often become a target before your more powerful ship. The Jedi Scouts can disable larger Dark Side ships with their stun abilities, clearing the way for the Bravo N-1s and Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter to take out either the large ships or fighters with their critical hit abilities. The Senatorial cruisers also help replenish the fighter swarms.<br>
<br>
Battle - Use Anakin&#39;s Inspiration to give your units the first attack in an arena. Try pairing Master & Apprentice with critical hit units to increase their chances of doing extra damage, remember, the two units it is used on do not have to be in the same arena. Out of His Misery will work best on either Anakin or Mace to help hinder some of the more powerful Dark Side characters. Windu&#39;s Solution, use to give a critical hit unit the first attack and better chance of critical hit or on one of your characters to give them the first attack and more power, a good combo with Master & Apprentice. Finally, Yoda&#39;s Intervention, prevent damage to your ground, space units, Clones or Padme at a critical time.<br>
<br>
Mission - Visit the Lake Retreat is great, use at the start of a round where you need some damage repair in every arena. Jedi Council Summons let&#39;s you pull the card you need for a stack or to replenish your character arena. Seek the Council&#39;s Wisdom gives much needed force as does Wedding of Destiny, along with card drawing abilities.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
