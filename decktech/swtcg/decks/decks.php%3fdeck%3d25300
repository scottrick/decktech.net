The idea with this is simple.  For those of you who haven&#39;t seen the Dark Side deck that won the GenCon Champs - it&#39;s a beast.  It&#39;s very well made, very well structured, and with the right amount of skill behind it - can win any game.  One of the good things about Star Wars TCG, is that no real good cards are REALLY that good, simply because if you fear that your Light Side deck can&#39;t beat such good cards, like Unfriendly Fire, you can simply bid to play the Dark Side, and thus negate the problem.<br />
<br />
My idea for this deck, was to make a deck that could handle the idea of that Dark Deck - a deck that just whipes out arenas quickly.  This deck works very well and has only lost one game out of the many it has played.  The idea of having units that can hold locations and outbeat the Dark Sides best, is one that works well.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll break down each category, but save the Character Units for last.<br />
<br />
Mission:<br />
This decks large power is based on Battle cards that help out other units.  In order to get those cards though, you have to find a subtle way of drawing and a balanced way.<br />
<br />
The first is Wedding of Destiny.  Obviously, this cards uses are all in its text.  One huge benefit from this card for this deck is the +1 force benefit.  This deck focuses a lot on having between 4-5 force to do what it needs to do and this card is a big help.  Many people may not play Slumming on Courscant, at least not three copies of them, but around here, they are very crucial.  In this area, Unfriendly Fire, Tyranus&#39;s Gift, and Trade Federation Offensive and Brutal Assault are very big cards.  Being able to go second in the build phase and remove these are a big help, and they enable you to see their hands as well so you can know whats coming.  Since we&#39;re running Anakin Inspirations and Windu Solutions, it&#39;s key to gaurentee you go first, so, removing a Trade Federation Offensive is huge.  Remember, Slums are good for that next turn.  Only remove from their hand what is going to be key to them getting ahead in an arena or possibly even winning the game.  Also make sure to pay attention to their hand, as you can&#39;t see what they may or may not have building, but you can certainly see what has a potential of coming down in future turns.<br />
<br />
Battle Cards:<br />
Ani&#39;s Inspiration is a card that really school&#39;d me at GenCon.  I thought for sure I had a better grasp on the game, but there were a lot of good cards from AOTC that our area wasn&#39;t playing much of.  After seeing the potential of going first, I&#39;ve learned this card is almost a must is most Light Side decks, especially if you can follow it up with a Windu&#39;s Solution.  I know this card is rare and somewhat hard to find based on AOTC wacky distribution, but, running Windu Solution x3 will win you a lot of games - it has me.  For some reason, not everyone&#39;s a huge fan of Pilots Dodge.  To me, they fit perfect in this deck because of the cost to prevent.  As I said earlier, the number of force you have each turn is crucial, so, using low ammounts of it to keep your units alive is very good.  Yodas Intervention is equally as good, and is usually the only requirment for having 5 or more force (so you can play this for 3 force and either a Jedis evade, Ani&#39;s Inspiration, or Windu&#39;s Solution).  Only use YIntervention when absolutely needed to keep a unit alive.  <br />
<br />
Ships:<br />
The great thing about the Light Side is how all of their units somehow work with other arenas, and not just in Ioning or Bombarding.  Point proven with Obis Starfighter, which gets &quot;sped up&quot; by Padme A.  Also, this is a great one to play Windu&#39;s Solution on.  Sometimes its crucial for your Jedi Scouts to go first, so their stun takes effect.  Remember they can stun anything they hit, so, don&#39;t hestitate to get rid of a Pilots Dodge with Slumming on Courscant if you have one of these guys down.  They&#39;re fast and their power is pretty good for their deploy, and remember, they get &quot;sped up&quot; as well.  Around our area the Suicide Droid starfighters are very huge, so the N-1 Starfighters and their speed of 60 kill those buggers perfectly, and remember, Dark Speed is often played on the DS, so, don&#39;t hestitate to deploy one of these things if you think you can make them waste one in the space arena.  You&#39;re not supposed to keep these guys alive, just kill those annoying Suicide Bombers.  Remember, this deck was built to &quot;handle&quot; most Dark Side decks out there.  By running a speed 60 unit to kill something with only a health of 1, that unit is only serving that purpose.  Don&#39;t try to keep these guys alive, but also, don&#39;t let those power 6 killers get through to your big bad boy Acclamator-Class Assault Ship.  These things will most likely kill anything they go up against because of their large power, even with their low speed.  But, try to protect these guys as much as possible, for, they are hard to deploy outside of the setup phase:)<br />
<br />
Ground:<br />
I wasn&#39;t a big fan of Lux Airspeeders either, until GenCon.  They are very good at speeding your units up, and then using an Ani&#39;s Inspiration or Windu&#39;s Solution to make sure your guys in ground go first.  These guys are nothing but fluff that generally attack first and get a good quick damage or two in before your big boys for the ground step up.  Jedi Heroes are fast, strong, and pretty healthy.  They do a good job of defending the arena against swarm, because most swarm only have power 2, and if they only hit 50% of the time you can evade that pretty easily.  Remember, Padme speeds these guys up as well.  Okay, now for what I&#39;m sure some of you are questioning.  Is there really a reason to play four copies each of the best ion cannon units for the ground?  Answer: Yes.  The Unfriendly Fire deck is very good at deploying the Trade Federation Control Core and having it own the arena.  These units with health 9 and health 8 are very good at staying alive, and on top of that, if a Lux Airspeeder is down or if you&#39;ve got some Inspiration or Solution in your hands, you can get these guys to go first.  &#39;Fraid of getting killed that turn in the ground arena but still need to clear out the space arena too?  Speed up to make sure you go before you die and ion cannon away!  Remember, Windu&#39;s Solution works on that ion cannon so feel free to shoot up in space with 6 or 4 dice!<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Okay, here is where I&#39;m sure the deck becomes questionable.  I&#39;ll explain.  Yoda is very good at killing quick deploy character units.  His built in force lightning can easily clear an arena of swarm in a turn or two.  On top of that he has a good power and good health, along with a great evade.  I pick him over Tank Mace (Mace A) because of the two less deploy cost.  While Tank Mace is very good, he requires mendings because once that beast is down, it is VERY hard to get him back down if he dies.  Yoda&#39;s deploy of 8 is a little easier to work with.  There are 3 copies of him so you can find him a little quicker, hopefully in the setup phase if you need him, but I&#39;d suggest only spending partial build on him and finishing him later, as the bigger guys in space and ground require more focus during setup.  Yoda B is very good for his deploy, deflect, and evade.  Also, you can stack him if needed.  Although a lot of cards benefit from Padme, she is not the focus of the deck by any means.  A lot of the character units are what I call &quot;helpers&quot;.  She&#39;s not really there to do anything but benefit the other arenas.  Her deploy is a little high for what she does in this deck, but she can save you from having to use an Anakin&#39;s Inspiration when you&#39;d rather save it for another arena sometimes.  Corde x2 is there for a cheap deploy during setup to see another card + save Padme and R2 if they&#39;re deployed.  She&#39;s nothing fantastic, but she will greatly help if they are trying to take the arena.  Jocasta Nu was added simply to push the battle/mission cards up.  Since you have such high deploy units, it&#39;s not always possible, or even likely, to deploy them.  Jocasta makes it easier to hand them, because you can just return those to the bottom of your deck and keep the battle/mission cards that you need.  She&#39;s not needed in duplicate, except for a deploy during setup if you&#39;re not seeing the battle cards you need.  Anakin B is a built in, everyturn, Windu&#39;s Solution for a ground unit.  It doesn&#39;t seem that great at first, but, when combined with the other battle cards, if needed he helps out a lot.  Nothing like using him and a Windu&#39;s Solution on the same unit to give it an ion cannons of 8:).  I don&#39;t really like Aayla, but she&#39;s quick, hard to kill - sorta - and a good distraction.  She&#39;s certainly not needed, but I liked her a little more than Shaak Ti for some reason.  Shaak Ti lives for a long time, but Aayla can heal herself, so, if they need to kill her they really have to try.  R2 is huge in space.  You can heal your Scouts and your big boys to keep them alive.  Remember, the unit he targets does not have to be in the arena, it can be in the build area, so you can retreat and use R2 to heal until they&#39;re ready to fight again.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s pretty much it.  I like going into the first real turn with at least 3 battle or mission cards in hand and I like ending the setup with a &quot;big boy&quot; in at least each arena, I try to shoot for:  Yoda C in character arena, Naboo Spaceport in Ground, and Acclamator in space.  Also, only deploy in the setup based on what your opponent deploys.  This deck can counter almost anything, so, for example, if they deploy Jango Fett in the character arena, deploy a character if you have one that isn&#39;t a &quot;hoss&quot; (like Padme, or Anakin).  Most opponents will deploy another character there, to solidify the arena, when its not even an arena you have to win because of such powerful ground and space units.  If they deployed a Tyranu&#39;s A next, that&#39;s 17 points they&#39;ve wasted in one arena, and they in no way can no win the other two.  Also, always deploy at least 2-3 &quot;little guys&quot; to see more cards in the setup.  Wait to deploy your big boys until they&#39;ve spent a good amount of points.  Remember, the right setup is key for victory.<br />
