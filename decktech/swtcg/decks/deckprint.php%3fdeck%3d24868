Character is strong and you can build characters fast here which means Jedi drop and kill.  Ground is slow but so that is why there is no lux speeders drop the Spaceport in this arena during setup then diring play drop cheap units to add to chaos then play departure discard the cheap 2or3 build units and gain +4 build and play a Jedi or a fighter.  Space is cheap and has fighter swarm going all units are 5 or less in this arena so you should be able to drop units faster than opponent unless they are swarming in which case the Royal starship comes into play with the 6 health and 5 power so it should pick a few out before it goes to discard then you play TTI and go get it back and a fighter and drop them next turn.<br>
  Character<br>
 Padme:  (E) is for the first 2 turns or so to drop Jedi fast to take this arena.  Then rearrange the stack and pow Your Jedi are drop and the benefits begin to happen.<br>
 Yoda:  He is great istant kill to droids or Jango or whoever that is not a Dark Jedi Master.<br>
 Mace: he is a badA$$ mofo.  Just stack and go give opponent some trouble.<br>
 Anakin:  Stack and go have fun.<br>
 Obi: Stack and go have fun.<br>
 Palpatine:  He lowers the speed of opponent characters always a great thing to have in your arsenal.<br>
  Ground:<br>
 All the cheap units (i.e. Chancellors Guard, Elite Squad, Naboo Escort, Clone Squad are for the ability to have a unit in this arena.)  The Spaceport has staying power and can deal damage just as good and can support the space with the Ion Cannon.  The Dropship when deployed adds 2 to your build so that is a key element and it has shields.<br>
  Space:<br>
 Fighter Swarm that is backed up with a Royal Naboo Starship.  Thats pretty much it.<br>
  Battle:<br>
 Four M&A that all it a great battle card pay 3 and two of your units in any arena gain 2 power.<br>
  Mission:<br>
 Hatch a Clone and Take the Intiative  are for the ability to always have a units in your hand to drop if the time calls for it.<br>
 Departure Time is for the ability to build then use it to discard a N-1 or a cheap ground unit to gain +4 build which could be enough to drop down Mace or some other big unit.<br>
  All in all just have fun.<br>
