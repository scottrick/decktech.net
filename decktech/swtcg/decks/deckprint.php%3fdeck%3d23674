<br>
With heavy space power and some decent speed you should be able to win that arena with ease. There are many helpers for you whether it be ground or space. You have power dive which is huge to use on Tyranus&#39;s Solar Sailer with a Strength of Hate. 4 Pilot&#39;s Dodges help out immensly with preventing kills agianst you and giving you a second chance to strike back. I use the sandcrawlers to set up my hand, and get the cards i need to provide support to the arenas that need them. In the character arena you will usually come up against many jedis. If you have a stacked Tyranus out you should usually take this arena unless they have tons of force. Use your Tyranus&#39;s Gifts wisely and you should have no problem. One other card i thought was a staple in here was Down in Flames. This card allows you to simply discard the light sides airspeeder which can help you attack first in most cases in the ground arena. Also you have 2 big Bombard ships in space to help you with the ground arena those have helped out in many instances for me. Nexu is also huge against jedis making them spend the extra force to evade. A jedi with no force is just a sitting duck. If you have any questions or suggestions d-mail me. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
