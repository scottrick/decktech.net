Naturally, the starfighters were all chosen due to their speed. Every one of the starfighters possesses a speed rating of 50 or greater, while the capital ships have a speed rating of 20, just so that they&#39;ll go before the Trade Federation Battleship or Droid Control Ship. The dark side equivalent to the N-1 starfighter is slower. The equivalent to the jedi starfighter is slower. And the equivalent to the Bravo N-1 fighter is just plain bad. Since you&#39;ll be repeatedly attacking first, you&#39;ll be repeatedly dealing damage first. And what could be more important than that? The Naboo Royal Starships are a bargain for only 5 (certainly a better deal than the slower Naboo cruiser. the Assault ship isn&#39;t bad, but with a cost of 7, it just doesn&#39;t keep with the theme of this deck) and can give you that extra meat in an extended space campaign. <br>
<br>
Ground selection: <br>
Once again, the premise is speed. The Walkers have great stats/abilities for their speed, and the speeder bike squadrons have surprising longevity. Those units will very often attack FIRST. Meanwhile, the elite jedi squads and Gunships will tie in speed with the ever popular destroyer droids. But the Luxury Airspeeders fix that problem in a hurry, so that virtually ALL of your units will attack before the opposition. And once again, what could be more important than that? The Airspeeders will sometimes draw fire away from your other units, buying you time to find your OTHER ways of getting your 40 speed units to attack ahead of the destroyers, such as Anakin&#39;s Inspiration, Windu&#39;s Solution, or Anakin B. <br>
<br>
Character Selection: <br>
5 Anakins? You darn skippy. Does anyone NOT know that Anakin is the best overall light-side character? No? I didn&#39;t think so. So stack him up and cut him loose. Amidala A makes all your jedi faster, and just turns Anakin into a wrecking machine. Or, a stacked up Amidala C will usually attack before being hit, and can then retreat for only 1 damage in the counterstrike. And your opponent will be tempted to attack her, since your other characters (barring R2) all have Evasion. Plo Koon is a powerhouse in his own right, Yoda has great abilities for his cost, and the Obi-wan C is there to stack under the Obi-Wan B, who just makes Anakin even harder to kill than normal. 2 copies of Anakin B so that if left uncontested in the character arena, he can give you a significant boost in the ground arena, while Yoda taps to give you extra force. R2-D2 is an absolute fiend. With 3 health, they will have to allocate a &quot;serious-minded&quot; attack to get rid of him, but they might be left with little choice. He gives all your N-1 and Jedi starfighters a critical 1 attack, which can obviously be huge when those starfighters are targeted by cards like Master and Apprentice, or Power Dive. <br>
<br>
Missions: <br>
Those Gunships can be a real pain to take out. Once your opponent has gotten them up to 3-5 damage counters, &quot;Return To Spaceport&quot; can be a huge setback for them. It&#39;s like having a brand new unit for only 1 cost. The only reason not to play with more of this card and fewer units is that you obviously can&#39;t put it out in the setup phase. :) The Jedi Summons card should normally be used to get another version of a Jedi you already have out. For instance, get the Obi-wan C to stack under Obi-Wan B, or use it to help stack Anakin&#39;s. In a pinch you could use it to pull Yoda, but that&#39;s getting pretty costly. <br>
<br>
Battle Cards: <br>
I said them what goes first, kills first, didn&#39;t I? So the Anakin&#39;s Inspirations are no-brainers. You should virtually never need them in space, but you can use them in ground to bump all your jedi squads/gunships to 60 if the airspeeder/Anakin B aren&#39;t getting it done. You can also use it in the character arena to attack before those souped-up stacks of Tyranus or Jango Fett. When Amidala A and Anakin A get inspired, and then targeted by Master and Apprentice, well, things tend to die. Fast. Master and Apprentice is also not really worth explaining, since most players recognize it as one of the stronger light-side cards in the game. The Power Dives are obscene. Things like R2 and Master & Apprentice don&#39;t only last for one attack, they last for the entire battle phase, so why not double the bang for your buck? With the Master & Apprentice/Power Dive combo, Obi&#39;s starfighter could attack at 5 dice/crit 2 twice, and then one of your Bravo fighters attacks at 5 dice/crit 1. Crazy. Could also be used with the Luxury Speeders or the Bike Squadrons, but that won&#39;t happen as often. Yoda&#39;s Intervention is just a bigger pilot&#39;s dodge, than can be used in any of the 3 arenas. I find it to be much more versatile than High Force Dodge (which is probably why the Intervention is rare, and restricted to light side only) The Knockdown is mainly just tech against someone who stacks up Tyranus or Jango (more often Tyranus) by himself in the Personal Combat Arena. Just put him on his butt, and then give him everything you&#39;ve got. On the other hand, your opponent might Knockdown your super-Anakin sometime! Since dark-side gets first shot at the &quot;play or pass chances&quot;, you&#39;ll be able to play Lull in the Fighting to cancel the battle if you&#39;re on the wrong end of a Knockdown. Nice. <br>
<br>
So there you have it. Obviously, a deck that requires quite a few rares. But if you&#39;ve got &#39;em, this deck works like a charm. Time to show the dark side a thing or two about &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;aggression&quot;. Enjoy. <br>
