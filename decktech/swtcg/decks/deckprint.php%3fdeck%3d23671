I&#39;ll explain later in the Strat.<br>
The Character Arena Only four character but stacking helps this arena a bunch.  I use Sidious ability pay 2 to evade 3 alot.  Tyranus when he is fully stacked is a god same with Jango ,but he is a jedikilla as myself. The two diplomats work together by giving me +2 build and oppoent none Wat cancel sans +1 build thing to opponent.<br>
 The ground you drop the Core because of the pure power and high health. Thespeeder is in there to make my droids faster.  The two droids are for the banging , you might say they are easy to kill well I remedy that ,but I&#39;ll explain later.<br>
 The space you want to drop the banking ship for the high health and shields.  The Droid Control Ship is there to make my droid fighters faster.  So the fighters will swarm in this deck. I did have SLave 1 in it ,but I thought it was useless. <br>
Battle Cards. Why no battle cards, because I just felt like using mission instead so I could use Sidious and Tyranus to there full power. Also, I wanted to build a deck with no battle cards just for fun.<br>
 Mission Cards: Alot yes ,but worth it yes. The Edict is the key to the deck. You play that on the three things I told you to at the start so the rest of your units can have fun picking them off without the thought of getting shot at. Splinter is for setting up the character Arena. Starship Refit is there to heal the space units. Order Here is to limit my opponents battle card use making him or her pay more to use them while it does not hamper me because I have no Battle cards. Dark Rend. and CApture are to further my plan by limiting force to my opponent.<br>
<br>
Main Combo of deck<br>
Tyranus&#39;s Edict + Banking Ship OR Sidious OR The Core. Making opponent fight card I want him to fight while I attack him with my units that can be attack.<br>
<br>
Sum up Limiting force for opponent and making things more expensive for opponent to play battle card and also making him fight what I want them to fight also benefit me in the end. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
