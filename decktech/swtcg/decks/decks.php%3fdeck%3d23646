1. Introduction <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait ... That doesn&#39;t compute ... You&#39;re under arrest!&quot;<br />
Remember that scene in Episode 1? The stupid battle droid isn&#39;t able to figure out what Qui-Gon wants, and needs a good two seconds to calculate it. Then, what happens? The heroic Jedi do their little lightsaber dance, and suddenly there are battle droid parts all over the place. Being an advocate for Battle Droid rights, I can&#39;t stand for this kind of behaviour. Battle Droids need respect, and if they don&#39;t get it, they will take it. Onwards, brave droids!<br />
<br />
This is my first attempt on a Droid deck. Some have claimed that the droids are not that good. I will try to show that the droids, when working together, can easily swarm and defeat your opponent in any arena. By utilizing the best Battle and Mission cards, and combining them with good droid units, you are able to put a powerful army on its feet in no time.<br />
<br />
As always, I encourage you to read the entire strategy, so that you&#39;re able to understand how the different units work together. Each card in this deck is here for a reason, a reason you might want to know. If you have any comments, they are appreciated.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Overview<br />
<br />
Droids being all they can be. Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Droid Starfighters go on a mad rampage, crushing everything that stands in their way. <br />
<br />
The deck connects the three arenas together using the Droid Control Ship. By getting this enormous space unit early, all your droids are speed +10. The Droid Control Ship will help you win the game, no doubt. I have experienced that you need only 1 Droid Control Ship, since your units will have more speed than your opponent&#39;s. The general strategy is to get out a lot of droids, and take advantage of the Droid Control Ship and the excellent Dark Speed to wipe out your opponent before he can react.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
<br />
&quot;No Tyranus? No Jango?&quot; This is a droid deck, and I don&#39;t recall Tyranus ever needing a reboot :). The two major power units are the P Series Destroyer Droid and the Super Battle Droid 8EX. Helping these two big units are the Assassin Droid and some Infantry Battle Droids. We also find Watto, who can make repairs on most of your units.<br />
<br />
Ground: <br />
<br />
A mixture of cheap, medium and expensive units, designed to quickly take control of the arena. The Destroyer Droid Squads are beasts, costing only 5 BP for 40/5/5. This is before you get help from the Droid Control Ship(s), and the Luxury Airspeeders you have out. By getting one or two of those smooth speeders out, you can quickly turn the game around.<br />
<br />
Space: <br />
<br />
As mentioned, the Droid Control Ship is the major unit in space. Guarding it are dozens of Droid Starfighters, included both to protect the Control Ship and to swarm your opponent. Also there is the extremely good Tyranus&#39;s Solar Sailer, which can single-handedly take down an entire armada of units, given time to do it. <br />
<br />
Battle: <br />
<br />
There are two things you want when playing this deck: a) Lots of units and b) Speed. Because you need a lot of units, the number of battle and mission cards is low. Only the best cards (in my opinion) are used. Giving +30 speed for free, Dark Speed is a card that will never stay in your hand too long. This card works on every arena, making it extremely versatile. Also included are Lost in the Asteroids, to stall space until you can get some Control Ship protection out, and Tyranus&#39;s Gift, a very good card that is also usable in every arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission: <br />
<br />
The Mission cards are cheap, meaning they can be played while still having BP for units. Splinter the Republic is very good, fetching cards from your deck when you need to. Also included is Starship Refit, yet another way of protecting your precious Droid Control Ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Card choices <br />
<br />
Character (16 cards):<br />
<br />
Assassin Droid ASN-121 (A) x 2<br />
For only 3 build points, you get this 50/4/1 unit. It&#8217;s good as a swarm unit even without the game text, but what a game text it is. By tapping it, you deal 3 damage to any character, unless your opponent has a Jedi and pays 2 force. This works like a charm on unprotected Clone Soldiers. Even if they have a Jedi, you are forcing them to use valuable force. Force they don&#39;t have when you attack with your power units.<br />
<br />
Destroyer Droid, P Series x 4<br />
The other power unit, and a good one it is. A 40/5/4 unit with Shields 1 (Huge!), these Droidekas have the opportunity of adapting to your opponent&#39;s strategy. You choose to either gain +20 speed or +2 power. This, ladies and gentlemen, is all free. Is he playing slow, beefy characters? +2 power. Fast characters? +20 speed. This is versatility at its best, and versatility is what wins games.<br />
<br />
Infantry Battle Droid, B1 Series x 4<br />
The Battle Droid is a cheap unit, with stats of 40/2/1, and you may draw a card when it&#39;s discarded. With some of these out, combined with the power units, your droid characters is a force to reckon. Though they die like flies, new ones will arrive, and help gain control of the character arena.<br />
<br />
Super Battle Droid 8EX x 4<br />
A very good card. By having 1 droid in any other arena (which you most likely will have), the Super Battle droid is transformed from an ok 40/5/5 unit into a bad[1] 50/6/5 unit. Get a Control Ship out, and this unit will outspeed most characters. It also costs only 5. I see no reason why 4 of these weird-looking guys shouldn&#39;t bee in every droid deck. Still, that&#39;s just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Watto (A) x 2<br />
Mr. Fix-it-all. Another great addition to a droid deck, Watto keeps your units alive a little longer. Watto, as the Assassin droid, is often the prime target of attacks. Even though Watto may die, remember that they&#39;ve used an entire attack on someone that isn&#39;t all that important for the character arena. This gives you time to attack again, possible gaining control of the arena. Since you&#8217;ve got 2, Watto come back for another beating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ground (17 cards): <br />
<br />
Battle Droid Squad x 4<br />
Yes, they only have 20 speed, but they are cheap and have a health of 3. Though they may not seem much, the Battle Droids are nice when you increase their Speed with your Luxury Airspeeders and Control Ship.<br />
<br />
Commerce Guild Droid 81 x 3<br />
For 6 build points, you get a 30/7/5 unit, able to wipe out a lot of units in one attack. They can take some damage, before being discarded, too. If you manage to increase their speed (which you will), the Guild droids will help you win the Ground arena.<br />
<br />
Destroyer Droid Squad x 4<br />
Haven&#39;t we seen these before? The Destroyer Droids return, this time in a whole squad, ready to fight for your cause. By using 5 build points on the droids that even defeat Jedi you get 40/5/5. This is a staple in any droid deck. A good unit, and one that will stay on the ground arena for some time.<br />
<br />
Luxury Airspeeder x 4<br />
Though not a droid, the Luxury Airspeeders are like Droid Control Ships for ground only. They give each other ground unit +10 speed, helping you gain an upper hand and attacking first. It&#39;s also a nice unit, 3 build points for 60/2/2.<br />
<br />
Walking Droid Fighter x 2<br />
Their health may not be much, but when given some speed these starfighters excellent for ground combat. With a single Dark Speed, this fighter is able to shoot down your opponent&#39;s precious units before he can react.<br />
<br />
<br />
Space (15 cards): <br />
<br />
Droid Control Ship x 4<br />
The most important card in your deck. Costing 9 BP, the Control ship has 9 power and 9 health allowing it to fight well and take lots of hits. Still, it&#39;s very slow and needs some protection. That is why all the other droids are here. The important thing about Droid Control Ship is the game text. Increasing every droid&#39;s speed with ten, the Control Ship is something you must guard with your life. Should it be discarded (which you must prevent at all costs), every droid gets one damage. You have 4 copies of it because you want it out as fast as you can. When the game starts, you should be able have 1 Control Ship out, guiding your brave droids on their way towards victory.<br />
<br />
Droid Starfigher Squadron x 4<br />
A cheap (3 BP) unit, that is able to protect your Control Ship while swarming your opponent. It has power 3/health 3, and thus it&#39;s able to shoot down most LS starfighters in one attack. The 40 speed isn&#39;t that much, but the Control Ship increases it to 50, which makes this one of the fastest units in the game.<br />
<br />
Droid Starfighter Wing x 4<br />
The big brother of the Squadron, this unit costs 1 more BP, but has one more power and health. It can take some damage, and is also able to attack well.<br />
<br />
Tyranus&#39;s Solar Sailer (A) x 1<br />
Should you have any problems with N-1 starfighters and the like, just call Mr. Tyranus and he&#39;ll come to your aid. The Sailer is the fastest space unit in the game, and the game text is also very nice. Since it&#39;s the fastest, it will (without any battle cards played) attack first. After it has attacked, you may retreat it so that your opponent can&#39;t touch it. It costs 4, but the power 2 and critical hit 2 gives you bang for your buck<br />
<br />
Droid Starfighter DFS-4CT x 2<br />
Simply another cheap space unit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle (7 cards):<br />
<br />
Lost in the Asteriods x 1<br />
This card will help you keep your Control Ship (and other space units) alive, and stall everything in space for a round.  That round can be used on building several new units, or perhaps a Starship Refit. Lost in the Asteroids gives you the power to decide when units fight, and whey they don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Dark Speed x 4<br />
This deck is about swarming and speed. The Swarming part is cheap droids. The speed part is the Droid Control Ship, Luxury Airspeeders and Dark Speed, this extremely good card. First, the card costs nothing. Secondly, it gives a unit +30 speed until end of turn. This card will help you win games, no doubt (you hear this a lot, don&#39;t you? ;]). Another thing is that is can be used everywhere. This is versatility, and versatility is good.<br />
<br />
Tyranus&#39;s Gift x 2<br />
Instead of preventing damage, you prevent your opponent from rolling dice. You pay 3 force to make the attacking unit -5 power. This is extremely good. There are only 3 characters (Anakin (A), Obi-Wan (A) and  Yoda (A)), 3 ground units (Naboo Defence Station, Naboo Spaceport and Republic Attack Gunship UH-478) and 2 space units (Naboo Cruiser and Republic Assault ship) that have base power of 6 or more. In other words, most of the time they will be rolling 0 dice. If that isn&#39;t damage prevention, I don&#39;t know what is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission (5 cards):<br />
<br />
Splinter the Republic x 3<br />
One of the best dark side mission cards. For only one BP, you get to fetch a unit from your deck. That unit must be one already in an arena, but that&#8217;s not a problem most of the time. Need another Super Battle Droid? Use StR to get it. Need another Luxury Airspeeder? Use StR to get it. Need another Droid Control Ship? Use StR to get it. A great card, that allows you to get the units you want when you want them.<br />
<br />
Starship Refit x 2<br />
<br />
By using only 1 meagre BP, you get to remove 4 damage counters from any of your starships. With &quot;any of your starships&quot; I mean Droid Control Ship. You _must_ keep it alive and healthy, and this cheap card will let you do just that.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Conclusion <br />
<br />
I hope that the read has been worth it, and that you now know exactly how this deck functions. All comments are appreciated. Oh, and keep on playing SWTCG :).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and attention.<br />
