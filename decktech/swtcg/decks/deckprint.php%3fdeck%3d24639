Focusing on Stun here. Hopefully, Anakin F, Obi-Wan D and Windu C can make Jango a poor old 0-power crybaby before he attacks. Most of the time, you want Anakin with A on top with C and F as transition stages. Rearrange E to the top when you are going for the kill. E is absolutely sick if you have Padme A out too. Padme E helps with the high build cost of your Characters, especially the big Windu A. Stack her with Padme A, then use Padme A to give your Jedi bonuses and during ur build step, rearrange Padme E to the top at no build cost and use the bonus, then rearrange A to the top when you&#39;re done at no build cost. Nifty. And you can always keep Padme E retreated and bring her in during your build step to gain the bonus. <br>
<br>
Obi-Wan B is a good character for just 5 build, with nifty offensive and defensive qualities. Obi-Wan D is huge with his Stun and with an Out of His Misery can take an unstacked Jango B all the way to 0 power. Quite a few copies of Windu as you need him for Moment of Truth. All 3 versions are not too bad, C is the main workhorse. Let B go under, and of course, if you ever manage to get A out...<br>
<br>
Aayla&#39;s 4-build is cheap, and she isn&#39;t too bad, with her Starfighter-like ability coupled with Evading to counter the greater power of the Character arena. Your opponent must choose whether to concentrate his forces on her. And if he fails to kill her off with a timely Evade or Moment of Truth, he will have to concentrate more on her to prevent his work from being undone.<br>
<br>
<b>Ground</b><br>
I was never a great fan of 71E or Speeder Bike Squadron and thus embrace their two new counterparts: Troop Transport and Republic Drop Ship. Troop Transport totally blows Speeder Bike out of the window. Drop Ship is nifty at the end of setup or as a partial build or after a large build cost roll. They are consistent with their Shields and what they lack in firepower, Elite Jedi Squad (still use it for its cheap deploy) and 23X make up for it. Master & Apprentice is key here.<br>
<br>
<b>Space</b><br>
The normal starfighters. N-1 is crucial now to get rid of the new Droid Starfighter. Jedi Starfighter Scout is rather good with its Stun ability. If not winning in the speed department, get Padme A out quickly or use Out of His Misery for some serious stunning of one of those larger DS ships, just be sure to roll a hit. Senatorial Cruiser is one of my favourite additions. Its stats itself are already very efficient for 6 build, and coupled with its recovery text, it can fuel a LS Space recovery.<br>
<br>
<b>Battle</b><br>
Master and Apprentice is essential for high-speed, quick-attack decks. Padawan and Senator is too expensive in my opinion. M&A is most useful in Ground or Space with your Critical Hitters.<br>
<br>
Out of His Misery provides some adequate protection of your generally weak units after they attack. Try to use it to shut down units with power exactly equal to Stun 4 or whatever Stun value you get. No Inspiration in this deck as almost all of the units attack first, with some exceptions in Space, meaning you are not maximising the use of Inspiration.<br>
<br>
Moment of Truth for some cheap evading as Jedi are rather force-intensive, and a M&A + Yoda&#39;s Intervention + Out of His Misery in one turn, for example, can drain you immediately. Get Windu out quickly, preferably during setup if your opponent is not fooling around with Nexus and the like, to maximise the use of it.<br>

<b>Mission</b><br>
Wedding of Destiny for card-advantage and Summons to get the cards you want, when you need them. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
