Lots and lots of the different versions of the Sith. Sidious (A) is there because Force is a major factor with Maul&#39;s intensive abilities, and his secondary ability is monstrous, almost entirely able to offset the Dark Side&#39;s weakness of building first if you get him out early. Sidious (B) is a really interesting card in my opinion. He can be stacked (or retreated if A is not out) and at the correct time, use his secondary ability to rescue a failing Space or Ground arena, or both. You know the feeling. Your stacked Darth Maul A is 1 away from getting killed and your opponent&#39;s Anakin will get the first attack. Dump him and use the wealth of build points to empty your hand in an all-out attack (and if needed, stack Sidious A on top again). His ability doesn&#39;t even require you to tap him, allowing him to retreat or attack after using his text.<br>
<br>
Some may think Maul sucks, but to me, he is a Jango-like character who actually has a chance of defending himself if his blinding attack fails to kill people off, and his attack bonuses are not restricted to Jedi. Plus he&#39;s cool. 2 copies of Maul A as he is not as weak as the other 2. D over B because B...7 build for 4 health and a cvading ability? Any Obi-Wan or Anakin can kill it, and don&#39;t even get me started on Yoda C zapping. Maul is the hard-hitter, and Maul D provides it, at 5 build. If you question Maul&#39;s cost-effectiveness, just remember that Jango costs nearly as much, and can&#39;t defend himself at all.<br>
<br>
Tyranus is incredible. B is the base you want to build on, with A or D what you want on top eventually, depending on the situation. C is chosen over E because he is used primarily for stacking and to provide some comparitively lower build cost in this high-build arena. Plus 5 Power, Stun 2 for you is most of the time only going to affect Obi-Wan (Yoda should be able to evade), nope, not too effective.<br>
<br>
The Characters all have really high build cost, so build wisely. Normally, you should emerge from setup with just a Nexu and a stacked character with plans for more.<br>
<br>
<b>Ground</b><br>
4 each of Destroyer Droid Squad and Super Battle Droid Squad, perhaps the most cost-efficient DS Ground units. Hailfire Droid is when you can get to couple the Stun ability with Luxury Airspeeder or Dark Speed, shutting down the AT/TE 23X, Republic Drop Ship, Jedi Heroes and AT/TE Troop Transport, whereupon ur slightly slower Droids can reap the benefits. Without speed bonuses though, the only common LS Ground unit it is usually going to destroy, or stun, is an Elite Jedi Squad. Commerce Guild Droids provide some cheap deployment to harrass the opponent. A couple of Luxury Airspeeders to get you the first attack against those annoying Walkers.<br>
<br>
<b>Space</b><br>
2 each of the unique ships. Solar Sailer is almost always an annoyance capable of huge devastation when supported by other space units, with Dark Speed to counter the occassional LS Speed bonus. Slave 1 B is a tad expensive but with its high speed, can take out a Jedi Starfighter or Bravo N-1 before it attacks and destroy it, or leave it unable to attack back. Sith Infiltrators provide longevity in the Space arena, and also usually attack first with 50 speed, and 4 power is usually enough to take out the Bravos. Commerce Guild Starships are there, to give your opponent an intriguing choice: attack the tapped units or attack the units with shields? Why not Intergalactic Banking Clan? Its 5 build is a little too high compared to Space, and with some build point draining you have on the Characters Arena, it&#39;s better to utilise the smaller version. Why Geonosian Defense Fighter instead of Geonosian Fighter or the Droid Starfighters? Basically, I want some cheap units to balance the build cost out, and 3 build for 3 health is solid. And where Geonosian Fighters and the 50/2/1 Droid Starfighter can get destroyed by N-1s, the Defense Fighter destroys the N-1s. Use it first to attack the N-1s and if you destroy it, your Solar Sailer can use its Critical Hit to concentrate on a larger target. And where the 50/1/1 Droid Starfighter might take another starfighter out before it frizzles, it is equally susceptible to N-1 and I want the cheap fighter to stay around to make my opponent choose to hit the Shielded Starships and let the Fighters attack again next turn or hit the Fighters and let the Starships attack.<br>
<br>
<b>Battle</b><br>
Dark Speed is my favourite card in the game. It wins games, and saves games, only when YOU KNOW HOW AND WHEN TO USE IT. I won&#39;t elaborate here, think I&#39;ll dedicate an entire article to it. Tyranus&#39; Gift because Maul needs it, and your other units might too. I have ommitted Strength of Hate for Pilot&#39;s Dodge. Blame it on my nightmarish luck with dice but I have found Strength of Hate to only be effective with Critical Hitters, and the only ones here are Solar Sailer and Tyranus B. Solar Sailer, I am happy for it to roll 2 dice as an annoyance, and Tyranus B usually has enough power on his own. Pilot&#39;s Dodge because you don&#39;t want to lose those expensive units.<br>
<br>
<b>Mission</b><br>
2 Splinters to build up that Tyranus, Maul or Sidious stack, or to fetch an extra twin you need for a certain arena. 2 Capture Obi-Wans to combo with Nexu, and a single Maul&#39;s Strategy when you have Darth Maul in. It isn&#39;t too bad, I&#39;d rather go with it then Dark Rendezvous. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
