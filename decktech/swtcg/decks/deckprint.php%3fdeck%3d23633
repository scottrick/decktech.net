<br>
<br>
<br>
1. In short:<br>
By having greater speed than your opponent in every arena, this versatile<br>
deck will swarm him and make him ask himself where all his units went. (Seen the before?)<br>
<br>
This strategy section is very long, but I encourage you to read it. It is important for you to know<br>
why each card is here, and how each card is a part of a bigger picture. This truly<br>
is a deck that links the Character, Ground and Space arena together. These combos are found in Card Choices, below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Overview<br>
<br>
This deck has speed, and lots of it. By combining the best units, battle<br>
and mission cards, I have created a deck that hopefully is able to<br>
out-speed any opposition. This deck takes the saying &quot;offence is the best<br>
defence&quot; and creates a strategy that revolves around it. In every arena,<br>
the goal is to hit first and hit hard. Both units and battle cards are<br>
carefully selected for their abilities and stats.<br>
<br>
Character: This is Jedi Swarm at it&#39;s best, with a little help from an<br>
Emperor-to-be. By using Padmé Amidala (A) and Chancellor Palpatine (A) and<br>
stacking your best characters, you will quickly take control over the<br>
arena.<br>
<br>
Ground: A combination of cheap units (Elite Jedi Squad, Luxury<br>
Airspeeder), medium units (Recon Speeders) and some heavy-hitters (AT-TE<br>
walker 23X), your attacks will come first. Because of the Critical Hit<br>
ability of the Jedi and the Walker, by the time your opponent gets to<br>
attack, he doesn&#39;t have anything to attack with.<br>
<br>
Space: Swarm your opponent with cheap and fast starfighters. Both<br>
Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter and the Bravo N-1 Starfighter has the critical hit<br>
ability. Remember: Their Droid Control Ship may be able to shoot done one<br>
fighter, but it can&#39;t stop the swarm from blowing it up :)<br>
<br>
Battle: Since this deck relies on getting lots of units, there aren&#39;t<br>
many Battle (nor Mission) cards. Every single battle card can be used in<br>
every single arena, which I see as a big advantage. This gives<br>
versatility, not leaving a card useless if my opponent chooses not to<br>
fight in a certain arena.<br>
<br>
Mission: Draw card, get more force, get characters from the deck; this is<br>
what the Mission cards do. See below for more information about card<br>
choice. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Card choices<br>
<br>
By explaining why each card is in the deck, you are able to see that this<br>
deck isn&#8217;t just some cards tossed together, but cards that work together<br>
in the ultimate goal of winning the game.<br>
<br>
Character (16 cards):<br>
Anakin Skywalker (A) x 2<br>
He is expensive, but combined with Padmé (A) and Obi-Wan (B), Anakin is a<br>
force to be reckoned with. Team him up with his Nabooan girlfriend, and<br>
he&#39;s speed 70 and power 8. This is _before_ you start stacking ;)<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker (B) x 1<br>
Some might dislike this version of Anakin, but he&#39;s there for two<br>
reasons: 1) He can be stacked. 2) If you see that your opponent is using<br>
the character arena for drawing cards etc (in other words, not fighting),<br>
Anakin becomes a permanent Battle card, free of cost (except tapping),<br>
that gives any Ground unit +20 speed and +2 power.<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker (C) x 1<br>
Another stackable Anakin, who also manages to fight off some evil<br>
creatures on his own.<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker (D) x 1<br>
Another stackable Anakin. This Anakin may also be used for &quot;bait&quot;: If<br>
you&#39;re sitting with a Jedi Council Summons (or even better, a better<br>
Anakin), you can deploy Anakin and see if your opponent reacts. If he<br>
smiles and plays Darth Sidious, smile back and unleash the true forces of<br>
the Force: The Jedi.<br>
<br>
Padmé Amidala (A) x 2<br>
A no-brainer in any Jedi deck. +10 power for ANY Jedi (this includes Elite<br>
Jedi Squad and Jedi Starfighter 3R3), in addition to smooching with her<br>
boyfriend (Anakin for those of you that doesn&#39;t know), making him power<br>
+2.<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi (B) x 2<br>
Even though the A version has higher stats, this version costs 2 less and<br>
the abilities are far better: Obi-Wan can evade, gain a critical hit<br>
(which is very important) and help his young Padawan Anakin while he gets<br>
his stack on.<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi (C) x 1<br>
Simply put, a card to stack. This Obi-Wan can also hold fort until the<br>
cavalry arrives.<br>
<br>
Yoda (A) x 1<br>
Yoda aka. &#8220;Madman with a Lightsaber&#8221;, is an evading monster. With the<br>
ability to evade 3 for 2 force and a health of 6, Yoda truly is a Jedi<br>
Master. Still, the cost of 9 is a little steep.<br>
<br>
Yoda (B) x 1<br>
This Yoda only costs 5, and is a good addition to your force of Jedi. It<br>
might be valuable to tap him for +1 force, since you have so many Jedi<br>
that require Force.<br>
<br>
Chancellor Palpatine (A) x 1<br>
Mr. Evil himself talks so much that your opponent&#39;s character falls<br>
asleep, and gets -10 speed. This could mean the difference of all his<br>
units attacking first, or your units getting the first *bzoizzz*.<br>
<br>
Kit Fisto (A) x 1<br>
A good Jedi who is reasonably cheap.<br>
<br>
Shaak Ti (A) x 1<br>
Another good Jedi. Cheap.<br>
<br>
R2D2 (A) x 1<br>
Pumping every single space unit I have, this little power monster is a<br>
great asset for knocking down your opponent&#39;s space units.<br>
<br>
Ground (15 cards):<br>
AT-TE Walker 23X x 3<br>
When attacking first, this giant walker is a monster on the combat arena.<br>
Throwing 5 dice with Critical Hit 2, combined with a base speed of 50, one<br>
should be on the watch for this Walker.<br>
<br>
Elite Jedi Squad x 4<br>
Running between the legs of the AT-TE walker are these incredible 1337<br>
(Elite) Jedi. Their base speed is as low as 30, but with Padmé, the Luxury<br>
Airspeeders and Anakin&#39;s Inspiration, these noble heroes will be able to<br>
plunge into attack before your opponent&#39;s units. Did I mention that they<br>
only cost 3?<br>
<br>
Luxury Airspeeder x 4<br>
A must in any speed deck, these speeders fly through the streets as if<br>
there was no tomorrow. By having a base speed of 60 and the extremely<br>
useful ability of giving every other ground unit +10 speed (including<br>
other Luxury Airspeeders), these speeders can help you turn the game to<br>
the better.<br>
<br>
<br>
Recon Speeder x 2<br>
&quot;What? A cost 5 unit? What are you thinking?&#8221; some might say after<br>
reading the card list. Still, if you want to win on ground, you must have<br>
some units that don&#39;t die like flies in case your attacks don&#39;t go as<br>
planned. A health of 3 and Shields 1, this little bugger will last for<br>
quite some time. Get a couple of Luxury Airspeeders out, and you will<br>
thank yourself for including Recon Speeder in the deck.<br>
<br>
Swoop Bike x 2<br>
A cheap unit with his speed. A good card if you only get 2 BP and need<br>
another unit in the Ground arena fast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Space (17 cards):<br>
Bravo N-1 Starfighter x 4<br>
These starfighters are some of the best in the game, in my opinion. For<br>
the low, low cost of 3, you get a speed 50, power 3, and health 2 unit<br>
with critical hit 1. That&#39;s a deal, if you ask me. By having two of these<br>
ships out and playing Master and Apprentice, you get one of the most<br>
potent combos around, able to knock out even the biggest ships.<br>
<br>
Jedi Starfighter 3R3 x 4<br>
In this deck, the Jedi fight all over the place. This starship is boosted<br>
by Padmé (A). Even without her, this 50/3/3 starfighter is a good in every<br>
space swarm deck<br>
<br>
N-1 Starfighter x 4<br>
We all remember these little needles from Episode 1, where they get to<br>
show how much they really sucked. In the card game, things are a bit<br>
different. This is the fastest space unit in the game, only tied with<br>
Tyranus&#39;s Solar Sailer. They&#39;re cheap, and they do their job well (much<br>
like the clones).<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter x 2<br>
Self-healing. Can you say that? Self-healing. It feels good, doesn&#39;t it?<br>
Knowing that you have a ship that removes _all_ damage counter before the<br>
battle phase (if it&#39;s in the space arena). But that&#39;s not everything.<br>
For 4 BP you get a 50/3/3 unit, with Critical Hit 2. In addition, Obi&#39;s<br>
sleek ship gains the speed bonus from Padmé (A) (Got to love that<br>
woman).<br>
<br>
Naboo Starfighter Squadron x 3<br>
These units are the Recon Speeders of space (only they&#39;re not, and they<br>
don&#39;t have shields). For 4 build points you get a 40/4/4 unit. Good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle (8 cards):<br>
The first thing you see when looking at the Battle cards is that they can<br>
be played in _all_ arenas. This provides versatility, and versatility is<br>
what wins you games. This goes for the rest of the deck, too.<br>
<br>
Anakin&#39;s Inspiration x 3<br>
You live and die by this card. For just 2 force, every single unit in an<br>
arena get +20 until end of battle. One of the best Light Side battle<br>
cards, and a card that will win you some games. Remember, play it where<br>
it&#39;s needed the most, at the right time, and things will change to the<br>
better.<br>
<br>
Master and Apprentice x 3<br>
Another excellent card in a swarm deck, this card provides 2 of your units<br>
with +2 power until end of battle. A very, very good card. Firstly because<br>
of it&#39;s cheapness, secondly because it can be used everywhere. A good<br>
combo is to use this card on two Elite Jedi Squads. Watch those Ground<br>
units crash and burn when your army of Jedi pokes them dead.<br>
<br>
Yoda&#39;s Intervention x 2<br>
Even this deck requires some damage prevention. Save this card for ground<br>
and space, and try to use the activated abilities of the Jedi in the<br>
character arena.<br>
<br>
Why so few defensive battle cards? Well, let me ask you this: After<br>
you&#39;ve gunned down 3/4 of his units, how much is there to prevent?<br>
Exactly ;)<br>
<br>
Mission (4 cards):<br>
<br>
Wedding of Destiny x 2<br>
<br>
This deck is able to play a lot of units, and this card enables you to get<br>
those units. Drawing three cards and gaining +1 force is very good for 2<br>
cost. The force generation will help you play more battle cards, or help<br>
out the Jedi in the character arena<br>
<br>
Jedi Council Summons x 2<br>
<br>
This card fetches a Jedi card from your deck, for the cost of 2. You are<br>
getting the Jedi units you need, when you need them. Again, this card can<br>
be played to get units for every arena: The Jedi for Character, the Elite<br>
Jedi Squad for Ground and Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter and Jedi Starfighter for<br>
Space. There will never be a time there is no point of playing this card<br>
(as with all the other Mission and Battle cards). Haven&#39;t got any Yoda?<br>
Get him. Need more units in space? Get a Jedi Starfighter 3R3 or<br>
Obi-Wan&#39;s Starfighter. A great card.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Conclusion<br>
<br>
After reading this strategy section, I hope that you have understood how<br>
this deck works, and how the combos work. I have tried my very best to<br>
create a deck where speed is the focus, and victory is the goal.<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
