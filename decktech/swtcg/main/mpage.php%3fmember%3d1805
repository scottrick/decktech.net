<b>The List So Far...</a><br><br><br></b>Yeah, I know.  

You&#39;ve been waiting eagerly for this.  (Well, okay, maybe 

not).<br><br>BUT....<br><br>I&#39;m layin&#39; out here for you 

anyway.  Bi-weekly, starting from 100, I&#39;ll be counting down 

my absolute favorite Console Games of all time.<br><br>And, 

to avoid any fanboy lynch mobs, here are my 100% legal 

disclaimers, to protect me from bodily harm.<br><br><br>1.  

This list is merely representative of MY favorite console 

video games of all time.  That is all.<br><br>2.  Yes, I am 

a very biased individual.  There are games that I have left 

off this list that might be considered "better" than games I 

have listed here.  However...it&#39;s my list.  I&#39;m a biased 

mofo, and an ardent fanboy of certain companies and 

franchises.  If this offends you in any way, just don&#39;t take 

it out on me violently.<br><br>3.  I would love for nothing 

more than for this list to engender tons of discussion on 

the Buzz Boards.  I could babble about games for hours on 

end, and I&#39;m trying to inspire others to do the same.  Even 

if it&#39;s "Man, I can&#39;t believe that chowderhead rated E.T. 

for the old Atari at #5!!! SuXooRS!:!("<br><br>4.  Lastly, 

some games are on this list because I recognize their 

importance into introducing certain games and gamestyles on 

the market.  While I may not have enjoyed them 100%, I still 

respect them and give them "much props".  So drink a sixty-

fo for my homeys, yo.<br><br><br><br>

SRC="http://www.geocities.com/franklincobb/Images/10-

1/Metroid1.jpeg"><br><br><br>Place me in front of both 

Metroid Prime and the original right now, and I&#39;ll choose to 

play Metroid Prime.  Put me in front of this and Metroid: 

Zero Mission, and I&#39;ll choose Zero 

Mission.<br><br>But.<br><br>This game was one of those that 

you never expect to find--a real treasure that influences 

the games you like for the rest of your life.  I discovered 

Metroid during the summer while staying at a relative&#39;s 

house for the summer, and to be honest my first thought was, 

"Eh, this isn&#39;t that great."  I had only played it for a few 

minutes with my wimpy jump and pathetic little 

zapper..."This is supposed to be fun?"  Still, I resolved I 

could beat this little quest/platformer game, and kept at 

it.  Ye gods, I found out...there&#39;s some kinda game 

underneath!  That first few "boring" minutes of the game 

belies the fact that there is this ENORMOUS world to explore 

here.<br><br>Needless to say, after I&#39;d found just a few 

powerups and realized I&#39;d only hit the tip of the iceberg in 

this game, I was hooked.  The game consumed the rest of my 

summer.  This is the only game that I started playing the 

night before, looked up, and realized it was 6 A.M. and I 

hadn&#39;t slept yet.  (Others have tempted me into the earlier 

hours of the next day, but never through the entire night!)

<br><br>Metroid influenced so many games that came after it 

and I see so many elements of it in games that have been 

released over the years.  It&#39;s almost a recurring theme in 

most of Nintendo&#39;s flagship titles, that exploration element 

where you see something you JUST can&#39;t reach...but you grab 

a power-up later in the game, and the lightbulb goes 

off...and back you go to find areas you didn&#39;t even know 

were there the first time!<br><br>The original Metroid was a 

cruel mistress, too.  First off, there was no map included 

with the game, nor a mapping feature in the game itself.  It 

was quite easy to lose your bearings inside similar looking 

areas and it was doubly easy to wander and not be able to 

know exactly where you needed to be heading next.  You truly 

felt like you were in an alien world that was very hostile 

to you, and sometime that sense of exploration could be 

quite overwhelming.<br><br>This was something that was kind 

of a letdown in both Metroid Prime and Zero Mission--both 

had hint systems that would cripple the entire exploration 

process as it held your hand throughout the game, showing 

you where to go next.  You could turn the hint system off in 

Metroid Prime, but a lot of the objectives seemed to be made 

in mind of the fact you would be actually using the hint 

system...and you&#39;d have to turn it back on just to realize 

you needed to head back two areas to find some hidden item.  

Zero Mission&#39;s was far more insulting by having the waylay 

points clearly point to areas on the map you needed to 

be.<br><br>For example: in the old Metroid, there is 

actually a "fake" boss in the game.  If you didn&#39;t know any 

better, you&#39;d think you have defeated the boss and head back 

to where you were supposed to be.  This ruse wouldn&#39;t work 

in one of the newer games...<i>you already know where you 

need to go and what you need to do.</i><br><br>And my 

favorite part of all--admit it guys, you KNOW you were 

surprised to learn that Samus was a girl.  Bunch of sexist 

pigs.  To this day, there are people who are still surprised 

to find that out...I read a message board where someone had 

suggested Angelina Jolie for Samus, and someone questioned 

why they would change the character to female.  What, chicks 

can&#39;t kick a<i></i>ss every now and then?  GIRL POWER

1/MarioWorld.jpg"><br><br><br>What can I say about Super 

Mario World that I haven&#39;t said about the others?  Well, for 

starters, everything that I liked about Mario 3 was 

represented here.  The linear play-through was officially 

history, as the game presented multiple paths, hidden areas, 

and shortcuts to get you through the end of the game.  There 

were lots of secrets to discover, many of them that would 

trigger alternate routes through the game.<br><br>The 

gameplay here was rock solid and a tad less gimmicky than 

Mario 3 in that the focus wasn&#39;t as high on the powerups and 

items but more on the individual levels 

themselves.<br><br>The graphics were a great way to 

introduce users to the SNES (Super Mario World was a pack-in 

with the original systems).  Bright, colorful, and eye-

catching and really utilizing the Super Nintendo hardware, 

it was hard for any casual or even serious gamer to not want 

to at least give it a try.  The levels were varied enough 

that your interest was kept throughout, and even some of the 

tougher areas didn&#39;t feel "unfair" and made you want to try 

just once more to make that difficult jump.<br><br>Super 

Mario World also represented a sort of situation systemic to 

most other Nintendo hardware in that their first-party 

offerings were wildly better than many of the early third-

party stuff, something that has probably hurt the flow of 

early adopters into any of their systems since.  Super Mario 

World was such a rock-solid, smoothly playing game that many 

 SNES owners were baffled when a ton of muddy, slowdown-

plagued games dominated the early scene.<br><br>Ah, but if 

only all game companies could have that problem--"Your games 

are just too good!"  It&#39;s both a curse and a blessing, I 

suppose.<br><br>I also enjoyed Super Mario 2, but it was 

such a different game and at times a more uneven experience 

that I just can&#39;t rate it in the same class as this one.  

Viva la Mario!<br><br><br>

1/StreetFighter2Turbo.jpeg"><br><br><br>Now, the Metroid 

syndrome applies here just as well.  Sit me down in front of 

a choice of Alpha 3 or this, and I&#39;ll choose Alpha 3.  But 

only because we played this to DEATH when it came home on 

the consoles.<br><br>When Street Fighter II hit the arcades, 

it single-handedly revived the industry and gave it a focus 

for the first time since the early days of Pacman and Space 

Invaders.  Gamers were eager to test their skills against 

one another, and Street Fighter II was so supremely put 

together that it fused that competitive edge with a nearly 

flawless game engine.  Naturally, success would follow, as 

the game literally took the world by storm and would 

generate a cottage industry that lined Capcom&#39;s pocket for 

years and years.  We were once so addicted to Street Fighter 

II that when we used to ride to school with an older friend 

of ours, we would go by the Wal-Mart and sneak into the 

lobby before they even opened just to spend an hour bashing 

each other&#39;s brains in.  (One of the managers eventually 

caught us and gently suggested that we didn&#39;t do this 

anymore....bummer!)<br><br>Street Fighter II for the 

consoles rode this wave of positive energy.  This was during 

a time when arcades were strong again, so for a game to come 

home for consoles was a BIG DEAL.  Capcom did such a great 

job shoe-horning the game onto the SNES, but I&#39;m convinced 

that even if it hadn&#39;t been excellently programmed it 

would&#39;ve sold like hotcakes anyway.<br><br>(What do people 

who sell hotcakes for a living say when they&#39;re having a 

great day?  "These are selling....like......um.....")

<br><br>Capcom knew that the iron was hot and struck again 

in arcades with Street Fighter II:  Champion Edition.  The 

fervor for this was incredible.  We hit up that selfsame 

friend to drive us 60 miles to an arcade where they got an 

early copy just so we could play a few times.  Yes, we were 

INSANE for Street Fighter.<br><br>This began Capcom&#39;s 

legendary ability to count to "III", but the next game in 

the series was so excellent that no one seemed to mind:  

Street Fighter II: Turbo Edition.  Adding more features and 

further refining the character balance and play, the 

increased speed of the game made it very difficult to go 

back and play the old versions anymore.  Once you&#39;d had a 

taste for Turbo, the old games simply seemed to be mired in 

molasses.<br><br>Of course, when it came to the SNES, we 

gobbled that up too, and spent even MORE time playing this o 

ne...and that&#39;s actually saying something!  2 AM game nights 

became routine on the weekends.  It was refreshing to not 

have Ken, Ryu, and Guile DOMINATE the proceedings anymore, 

though eventually I managed to systematically get banned 

from EVERY CHARACTER in the game.  (This is the only reason 

today that I possess any skill with E. Honda...it became a 

necessity!)<br><br>And when I started college, the game 

proved it still packed a lot of punch as my roomate, who had 

never been bitten by the Street Fighter bug, suddenly got 

hooked on it.  I tried to take it easy on the guy, but he 

could tell when I was throwing a match...this often led to 

frustrated "One more game!" after I&#39;d kick his 

butt.<br><br>By far the best of the pre-Alpha series, and I 

think in regards to the industry it was this run that was 

the most influential.  I&#39;d gladly still play it today (and 

even own my original cartridge!)  One of the fighting game 

genre&#39;s finest moments in regard to design, playability, 

balance, and fun.<br><br><br>

1/Goldeneye.jpeg"><br><br><br>Let&#39;s face it--licensed games 

usually suck.  And I don&#39;t mean just sort of suck, I mean 

some hardcore, hoover-level suckage.  Jank like Total 

Recall, Cutthroat Island, many of the Batman games...all 

just REEK.  It was because of this that Goldeneye initially 

snuck in under the radar.<br><br>I was working at Wal-Mart 

at the time, and one of the guys I worked with told me, "You 

have to play Goldeneye".  Apparently, someone HE knew had 

recommended it...and so on and so on.  I just smiled and 

nodded politely, wondering what a licensed game of a two-

year old movie could possibly offer me.<br><br>During one of 

our gamedays, he brought it over, and I was forced to re-

think my opinion of the subject.  Prior to this we had been 

hooked on Starfox for the Nintendo 64 and the split-screen 

dogfights.  Ten minutes after we&#39;d started our first 

deathmatch, everyone of us in the room knew we were going to 

have to go out and buy our own copies.<br><br>Before this 

time, first-person shooters just weren&#39;t something that 

translated well to the consoles.  There were terrible 

versions of Wolfenstein and other such games for both SNES 

and Genesis, but neither system had the hardware power to do 

the genre justice.  For us, this was something else entirely 

that we hadn&#39;t been expecting--an engrossing FPS with an 

excellent multi-player focus!<br><br>When I bought the game, 

I had just assumed it would be to practice.  After I delved 

into the story mode, I found out differently.  The game 

possessed one of the most coherent, theme-appropriate story 

modes I had ever seen.  Gone were the days of disembodied 

Mr. T heads zapping multi-colored blobs or Smurfs dying 

after bumping into something...this game put you in Bond&#39;s 

shoes in a spy thriller that rivaled the movies!  Each level 

would often demand some different skill out of you, and you 

would get to do great Bond things like use your laser-watch 

gadget to escape from a train, bungee jump off of a dam, 

steal a tank and plow through hostile forces, make a mad 

dash for an airplane to make your escape...it was really 

quite remarkable how much care was put into this mode.  It 

was like getting two-for-one...an excellent deathmatch-style 

game AND a great story-driven shooter!<br><br>To this day, 

any console FPS that comes out invariably gets compared to 

Goldeneye.  "Is it the next Goldeneye?"  I have recently 

found a copy of TimeSplitters 2 at the suggestion of another 

kind DTer, and I think we may have missed "The Next 

Goldeneye" while we were looking the other way.  (It doesn&#39;t 

hurt that several programmers from Goldeneye actually worked 

on TimeSplitters).<br><br>Goldeneye let developers know that 

FPS certainly had an audience on the console side of things, 

providing they were done correctly.  Ditto for movie-

licensed games.  This didn&#39;t prevent them from releasing 

tons of crappy FPS and licensed games to follow this one, 

but at least it&#39;s the thought that counts.<br><br><br>

1/Mario64.jpg"><br><br><br>Let me fess up now when I tell 

you this--originally, I had no intention of purchasing a 

Nintendo 64.  None.  Nintendo had been too busy making us 

play the waiting game for their new hardware, as countless 

release dates and promises continued to slip by.  The Killer 

Instinct arcade game would loudly proclaim "COMING TO YOUR 

HOME IN 1995...." even though it was obvious the game wasn&#39;t 

running on console hardware...and 1995 came and went without 

the release of the then-Ultra 64.<br><br>Leave it to Mario 

to bring back those who have strayed from the flock of 

Miyamoto.<br><br>So I demoed the game at a kiosk one day 

while an eager Nintendo representative stood by watching.  I 

had smirked that I really hadn&#39;t planned on buying 

Nintendo&#39;s new !#$!@ system since it had taken so long to 

come out, but I would try the game anyway.  The smile on the 

rep&#39;s face was obvious as I was forced to admit...Mario 64 

was the most amazing thing I had ever seen on a console 

system.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m still a big fan of 2-D, but didn&#39;t 

it always seem weird how Mario would only run from left to 

right in a linear line?  Didn&#39;t he care enough about 

Princess Peach&#39;s sweet cuppin&#39; cakes to, I don&#39;t know, EVADE 

the enemies by going around them?  What about the Belmonts 

in Castlevania?  (On second thought, given the less-than-

stellar 3D offerings in the Castlevania series, let&#39;s just 

be thankful the Belmonts are so good at meeting Drac head-

on).<br><br>It really was a new experience being dropped 

into a 3D world and saying, "do what you want."  It&#39;s the 

same idea that is still serving games today such as Grand 

Theft Auto (though Tommy does things that most plumbers 

would frown on, especially a friendly chap like Mario).  

Want to run to the far side of the castle?  Hey, go for it.  

Want to swim in the moat for awhile?  Hop on in!  Literally, 

it was obvious that this was something entirely different 

than what had come before.<br><br>And even better than that 

was the fact that despite what could be seen as a gimmick 

(the taking of the series into 3D), the game itself still 

felt very much like your classic Mario title, only with new 

challenges to conquer.  Power-ups, secrets, familiar foes, 

the butt-bump....all here.  Not to mention that for the 

time, these graphics were absolutely impressive.  Game 

stores ran this as a demo for quite some time, and there is 

even a used game store near me that uses Mario 64 to demo on 

one of their large screen TVs.  (And it still

1/FF3.jpeg"><br><br><br>There seem to be two distinct camps 

of Final Fantasy fandom:  those who like the newer games and 

worship VII as the second coming, and those who look at 

Final Fantasy 3 as forever the best title in the series.  

While I don&#39;t quite fall into that divisive schism, I gotta 

admit that this remains the finest hour for the Final 

Fantasy franchise.<br><br>Chances are, though, if you don&#39;t 

like this game, you will likely never EVER like a console 

RPG.<br><br>What&#39;s so great about Final Fantasy III?  This 

installment took the grand sweeping storyline of II and 

improved on almost every element.  In part II you really 

only ever feel for a few of the characters, and the 

plotline--while epic--just doesn&#39;t begin to encompass the 

relative scope ot the adventure to be had here.<br><br>And 

make no mistake--for the SNES, Final Fantasy III was a tour 

de force of graphics and sound.  Forever shattering the 

notion that RPGs had to be the spartan-looking affairs such 

as the Ultimas and Wizardrys of the past, the world of Final 

Fantasy III was filled with color and detail.<br><br>This 

too is the first FF game I can remember that began the whole 

"super-ultra-hidden-item" thing...where there were hideously 

rare items and/or monsters that could be fought if you 

wandered far, far off the beaten track to find them.  Of 

course, you were free to defeat the game none the wiser to 

the presence of said items, so in that regard the game 

allowed different levels of involvement.<br><br>From this 

point on (and really, it began for me with Final Fantasy 

II), the storyline and characters became a huge focus for 

the game, and it&#39;s something that Square have proven they 

can do very well.  Sure, we&#39;ve had minor tweaks here and 

there over the years, but it&#39;s the story we come back for, 

each and every time.  And it&#39;s not just Final Fantasy--this 

same care is put into most of their games, making people 

like me BIG fans of the company.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m a Square 

fanboy.  I admit it.  But in the face of a quality game such 

as this one, I just don&#39;t feel like I have to justify myself 

too much.  And considering that every console RPG that comes 

out simply wants to be the next Final Fantasy...well, as the 

legendary Ric Flair once said, "To be the man, you got to 

BEAT the man!   WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

1/ZeldaLTTP.gif"><br><br><br>I didn&#39;t mention it in my 

write-up of Super Mario 2, but there was another game in the 

flagship line of Nintendo titles that suffered from a 

generally ill-received sophomore effort, and that was Zelda 

II.  Like Mario 2, the gameplay was radically different than 

its much-beloved predecessor, and for that reason I think it 

was unjustly criticized.  I must admit, though, that of the 

games on the Cube&#39;s Zelda disk, Zelda II has only been fired 

up once...<br><br>The problem with Zelda II was that instead 

of the overhead perspective, all action took place from a 

side-scrolling perspective.  You wandered around an 

overworld map, but when you bumped into an enemy--side-

scrolling time.  Ditto for the dungeon levels, which were 

generally well done but often introduced things like jumping 

puzzles that just didn&#39;t really mesh with the Zelda 

experience as a whole.<br><br>Unlike Mario, it would take 

the SNES to "redeem" the series, and Link to the Past came 

through with flying colors.  Returning to the preferred 

overhead perspective, LttP brought with it greatly improved 

graphics, sound, and gameplay that had to be seen to be 

believed.  The new dungeons were challenging and cunning, 

providing new elements to exploration and boss battles that 

hadn&#39;t been done in the series before.  As far as a 

graphical overhaul...most people who played the game 

originally will tell you how floored they were when Link 

left his home for the first time into that very cool pouring 

rain effect.<br><br>All the old elements were here, 

too...the exploration, the use of items to access previously 

unattainable areas...but this time, the story was told more 

cohesively than "Zelda kidnapped, get triangle pieces, meet 

Ganon in Death Mountain".  The music had gotten a boost into 

overdrive too, with a mixture of new tunes as well as 

rearranged versions of familiar themes.<br><br>The only bad 

part of the game was that stupid little hint book they 

included with the game...you would think it only included a 

few gentle clues to get you going, eh?  WRONG.  A friend of 

mine made the mistake of opening his...and half the game 

ruined for him.  Sure, you didn&#39;t <i>have</i> to read it, 

but woe unto you if you decided to take a peek....I&#39;m not 

sure what mental invalids Nintendo thought would be playing 

this game, but I&#39;m glad to see this was their one and only 

foray into including hand-holding with their flagship 

titles.<br><br>An excellent game, worthy of picking up in 

its original form or in its Game Boy reincarnation....if 

only they didn&#39;t program Link to shout and yelp with EVERY 

SWING of the sword....I&#39;m sure any gaming fan has tried 

this, and if you haven&#39;t, be prepared to become a Zelda fan.

1/SuperMetroid.jpeg"><br><br><br>If you KNOW I was hooked on 

the original Metroid, imagine my surprise when I rented THIS 

baby.  I honestly did not believe they could possibly top 

the original, but Nintendo has proven time and time again 

that when you think they&#39;ve topped themselves, they can do 

it again.<br><br>Super Metroid was possibly one of the 

greatest refinements to the series, and is likely the only 

reason anyone cared enough to be outraged when they heard 

Metroid Prime was going to be a first-person affair.  The 

exploration effect was ratcheted up considerably, and even 

with the new auto-mapping feature you still had a LOT of 

ground to cover.  The controls were spot on and ultra-tight, 

meaning you only had yourself to blame if you were defeated. 

 And the weapons and gadgets....oh, those gadgets.  Super 

Metroid found Samus packing all sorts of cool gear from new 

stuff like the Grapple Beam to old favorites like the Space 

Jump Boots.  When you picked up a new item, without fail 

that trademarked lightbulb would go off in your head as you 

wandered back to some previously unexplored area to take 

advantage of your new gear.<br><br>The thing about Super 

Metroid is that even though you spent a lot of time 

exploring and often less time fighting, the game itself 

engrossed you to the point where you didn&#39;t even notice.  

There was plenty to explore, too.  In a nice touch, the 

early portion of the game lets you visit the area where 

Samus originally defeated Mother Brain, and the whole area 

has a deserted look.  Mother Brain&#39;s shattered glass tank is 

even still there!  It isn&#39;t long before Samus stumbles on to 

the nefarious plans of the Space Pirates, and there are lots 

of new foes to defeat as well as old favorites such as 

Ridley (doesn&#39;t this guy EVER die?!  And what&#39;s the 

discrimination with Kraid...he was just as cool as Ridley!  

Well, maybe not quite AS cool as a winged demon-

dinosaur...thing, but close!)<br><br>Super Metroid is just 

pure nirvana, and it&#39;s a hallmark of game design.  If this 

game were released today it would still be considered 

excellent, even though I think that the Metroid Prime series 

has done an admirable job in maintaining the high quality 

standard set by Super Metroid.  When Samus&#39; next adventure 

debuts on whatever the name of the next Nintendo machine 

turns out to be (had to pass on the DS, thanks), you KNOW 

I&#39;ll be waiting in line to explore the world of Samus, 

Chozos, and the Space Pirates one more time.

1/SOTN.jpeg" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=280><br><br><br>So....what do 

you get when you cross two of my favorite games of all time? 

 If you said the number 2 entry on my all-time favorite 

list...congratulations!<br><br>Castlevania: Symphony of the 

Night debuted at an interesting time for both the series and 

for the 2-D genre in general.  Super Mario 64 had really 

taken the world by storm, not to mention the 3-D revolution 

pioneered by the Playstation.  It seemed that for the most 

part the 2-D game was dead, despite the moans of protest 

from the old-school gamers.<br><br>Castlevania itself had 

taken a lump or two with the abyssmal N64 3-D offerings.  

True, these games weren&#39;t programmed by Konami proper, but 

they did come out with the formerly hallowed Castlevania 

name attached, and the damage had been done to the series&#39; 

reputation.  Was Castlevania doomed to remain a relic of the 

2D era?<br><br>Turns out...yeah, kind of.  But Konami found 

a way to make that a GOOD thing.<br><br>Symphony of the 

Night was the ultimate marriage of everything that was good 

about Super Metroid AND the old Castlevania games.  2-D and 

proud of it, it also dug back into the RPG roots that 

Castlevania 2 had dabbled with.  Instead of a Belmont, the 

game chose a more interesting protagonist, Dracula&#39;s son 

Alucard who debuted as a playable character in Castlevania 

III.  Maria, Richter Belmont....this game was deeply rooted 

in its own past, but sometimes...everything old is new 

again.<br><br>The story in this was also engaging.  It seems 

as though Alucard did not wish to side with his father and 

sought to put an end to his reign of evil.  Unlike the 

Belmonts who fought the curse out of duty, this was more 

striking because it was about choice, and in Alucard&#39;s 

choice choosing <i>against</i> his father.<br><br>Before his 

battle was through, Alucard would defeat hordes of enemies, 

giant bosses, encounter a few characters sympathetic to his 

cause, and wander through a GIGANTIC castle that slowly 

opened up to you as you gained levels, items, and 

experience.  Weapons and shields could be used and equipped, 

and certain combinations would yield unexpected 

results.<br><br>Of course, just when you thought the game 

was complete, you were in for a surprise....even though you 

could mistakenly think you had completed the game, word had 

spread so quickly on the fact that there was still <i>half a 

game</i> to be played after this "ending"...provided you 

found the right items, of course.<br><br>And the 

music....man, where to start on the great themes inside this 

game?  Appropriately for a game with "Symphony" in the 

title, SotN made liberal use of the vast CD storage and 

contained a soundtrack that I still listen to today.  

Haunting themes, dashing adventure melodies, guitar rock, 

the soundtrack seems to encompass all styles.<br><br>This, 

my friends, is 2-D bliss.  It&#39;s everything I love about 

Super Metroid but with the gothic Castlevania flair and a 

TON of extras to boot.  This game revitalized the series, 

where it found a natural home on the Game Boy Advance in the 

form of excellent titles such as Circle of the Moon and Aria 

of Sorrow.  We&#39;re still waiting on that killer 3D 

Castlevania to arrive, but if new games in the series keep 

borrowing from a game as good as Symphony, that&#39;s just fine 

by me!<br><br><br><br><br><br><FONT SIZE= "+8">AND

1/ZeldaOOT.jpeg"><br><br><br>How can I not consider this the 

greatest game of all time, or at least my favorite that I&#39;ve 

ever played?  Simple.  Nintendo has proven that they can 

really pump quality by the shovelful into their premiere 

titles, and nowhere was that more evident with the title 

that shook the series (and many of its pretenders) to the 

core--The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.<br><br>There was 

quite a bit of concern about the ability to translate the 

Zelda world into 3-D.  After all, Zelda wasn&#39;t really about 

jumping or platforming, and how would Zelda&#39;s traditional 

swordplay work out in a 3-D setting?<br><br>Fools!  You 

doubt Miyamoto?  I STRIKE THEE DOWN!<br><br>From the moment 

you fire up Zelda with its hauting melody as Link rides 

across the plains on his steed, OoT manages to be a 

completely engrossing experience.  Everything that served 

Mario 64 well manages to work just fine here.  The 3-D world 

is awesomely realized, and when you strike out over Hyrule 

Field as the sun sets, you&#39;re very likely hooked.<br><br>The 

naysayers complaints?  Turned out that Miyamoto had an 

answer for every one of them.  Instead of having to worry 

about platforming, Link would "auto-jump" whenever 

appropriate.  And as for combat, it&#39;s hard to imagine a time 

without "Z-targeting", but it began right here.  Using the 

Z-trigger, Link could lock on to his foes, freeing him up to 

parry, thrust, and successfully vanquish his 

foes.<br><br>The whole package just comes together as 

something that has rarely been equaled; that stroke of 

genius that successfully marries a seemingly-alive "world" 

(aided by the sunrise/sunset and real-time lighting effects) 

with well-designed characters and a great story to achieve 

true greatness.<br><br>The dungeons...oh, the dungeons.  

Some of the most deviously designed in Zelda history, ask 

anyone who has played through this game to tell you about 

the "Water Temple".  This was the most challenging Zelda 

yet, but the experience was richly rewarding.<br><br>Though 

Wind Waker was a good game and was certainly passable, 

there&#39;s a reason why Zelda fanboys are salivating at the 

prospect of Zelda: Twilight Princess...the hope is that we 

will get that next milestone in the series, one that can 

finally, finally make us forget about the Ocarina of Time.  

At least for a little while.  Writing this list inspired me 

to start playing through it AGAIN....hopefully I remember 

how to get through the Water Temple, or I&#39;m 

doomed.<br><br><br><br>
