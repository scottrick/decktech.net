	Dice-rolling.  A childs game.  Totally random.  These are some of the terms which have been used to describe the new Attack of the Clones TCG.  But those who have sampled the game know better.  In this article, I hope to help expound on some of the strategies and tips of the game that will lead players to a higher-tier of play, and let them laugh at their opponents as the luck runs out for them.  True, that random element will never be completely controlled, nor can you count on it in any solid capacity.  However, the game has a structure that will allow you to maximize your strategic advantage and allow you to both minimize runs of bad luck and make the maximum utility of a patch of high dice rolls.<br />

DECKBUILIDING<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a museum and I&#39;ll fill it.&quot; <br />
- Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	Youve got to do this firstafter all, no deck, no game--and in truth here is likely one of the most important elements of your Star Wars TCG experience.  Your cards and mix thereof will determine your options and availability of strategies at various points during the game.  Like most card games, there is an ebb and flow to your hand as you draw new weapons and make use of existing tools.  Since the idea of the game is to control two arenas, how best can you do this?<br />
	Had the game designers not had the foresight to limit your deck construction, this actually would be a fairly degenerate situationyou would merely ignore one arena and maximize your forces in the two arenas you actually wanted to win.  However, the restriction that we must utilize troops from all arenas, as well as a ratio limit of no more than twice your lesser arena in units, we must operate under these constraints while attempting to achieve the same goal.  After all, the victory conditions remain exactly the samewin two arenas.  How can deckbuilding facilitate this?<br />
	The first thing to consider is, what is my theme?  It is not necessary to settle on a hard and fast theme here as it is in most card games because the win conditions are currently set in stone and dont allow for more inventive victory paths.  If you decide to use them, some common themes include Jedi Evade and Deflect and Force Denial.  To illustrate, a Force Denial deck makes use of such cards as Poggle the Lesser and Capture Obi-Wan to deny your opponent of force and maximize your use of the force.  This decision will likely set you down a path that will make your further deck-building choices much easier.  If you decide space swarm, for example, you immediately know that you will need fast, cheap space units and battle cards to back them up and maximize their punch.<br />
	The second aspect to examine is thiswhat ratio of support are you going to give to each arena, given your theme and strategy?  I believe that it is very important to determine at the outset which two arenas you are going to win, and this decision will likely be made by the theme you have chosen.  It is likely possible to develop a deck that is capable of winning any of the three, but you run the risk of hitting the wrong units or battle cards at an inopportune moment and this will thwart you at a critical moment.  Likewise, it makes your future use of battle cards more problematic, as you must determine on the fly which arena needs that assistance the most.  If you have decided that the ground and space are for you, that makes these sorts of choices easierdo only what you need in the character arena to stall/survive, and make maximum use of your battle cards in the arenas you intend to win.<br />
	Now that you have chosen your two desired arenas, you must choose the ratio and cost of the units that will be defending these arenas.  If there is one thing that Ive noted in CCGs, it is that usually when there is a boundary or limit on gameplay or deck construction, it was put there for a reasonhence, it is often a good idea to push against this boundary to fully exploit that strategic advantage that the game designers saw fit to limit.  What this means for us is that 12 is the minimum limit for an arena, and if you are not intending on winning a particular arena, it will likely be a good idea to gravitate toward this minimum to decrease the odds of drawing this particular unit when you need further support in your primary arenas.  Likewise, youll want to increase the number of troops from your primary arenas in relation to your ternary arena to strengthen them.   There is no hard truth to the appropriate ratiobut once you have chosen thusly you can appropriate battle and mission cards to support weaknesses and increase strategic pursuits.  These will also facilitate your deck theme and ensure you have the tools to pursue your advantage.  Your costing decisions for units are quite important and have been overlooked in this section because they play a much greater part of your Setup phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
  IT&#39;s A SETUP!<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.&quot; <br />
-	Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)<br />
<br />
<br />
	There is an excellent article on the Setup phase already featured on this site, and I dont wish to step too much on the grounds already covered there.  I would like to directly link the Setup phase to your deck-building.  That seems so painfully obvious to state, but by looking at potential deck flow at this stage you can see how the decisions you make during the deck construction step will have a great deal of impact on how you fare during this phase, the most important of the game as far as setting the tone for the conflict to come and equipping you to pursue your strategy and win the game.<br />
	I like to think of the Setup phase in relation to later Build phases.  They have a definite synergy that can be exploited here.  The build rolls that will follow will impact your ability to function and react during the game.  Considering the average roll for a build is 3.5 (simply taking the average of all face values on a die) and rounded down to 3, I like to equate this value with a one-turn solution.  That is, anything which has a build cost of three has statistical odds of being available to you within one turn.  I have purposefully ignored the all three arenas bonus because you will not be able to count on it when you need the come-from-behind power of your arriving cavalry.<br />
	Following this idea, then, you can divide your 30 points by this magic value of 3 and you will see that 10 units could potentially be dropped from hand during Setup.  This is huge because the ratio of drops to draws here is 1:1.  Assuming you did decide to drop 10 3-cost units, you could see very nearly a third of a 60-card deck.  This flow and drawing are so crucial because future draws in the game are one-per-turn (barring any card drawing engines you may include).<br />
	However, some strategies are not conducive to this 3-cost value.  Thankfully, the nature of a deck which has high-cost units can benefit from Setup by hitting the ground running, so to speak.  This type of deck should still look to that 3-cost number in order to provide additional support.  You can, however, bring out units instantly that can take an agonizingly long time to build during the game (especially with a series of bad build rolls).  If your deck wants the killing power of rare Jango Fett, he will statistically cost 2+ turns to get outso you want him out NOW during Setup (or at least partially built at the end).  This will mean a diminished deck flow and will also necessitate some cheaper units to help you increase the odds you hit the Jango you need to get your deck up and running.<br />
	As I said, there is an excellent article on Setup already available here on Decktech which touches on the back and forth dynamic of this phase, and I dont want to retread the same ground.  But appropriate costing of your units during deck-building will maximize your ability to engage in this strategic dance between players and units.  You can win or lose the game thanks to your actions here, so make sure that your deckbuilidng doesnt undermine your ability to fortify your positions and make sure your strategy hits the ground running, so to speak.<br />

	Setup is finished, and now comes time to roll the bones and utilize your battle forces to crush your opponent.  Maybe your theme is fast, cheap units; perhaps you have chosen slower yet harder hitting ground units which hope to deliver crushing blows all at once.  Either strategy must still be subject to the whim of the dice and the odds that are presented to you at each step.<br />
	What will you do when your attack comes?  The first thing to stress is that you should choose ONE target in the arena to bring down.  There are choices to be made here, but they usually are determined by your ability to select the unit which poses the biggest threat to you.  This threat may be the 7 power ground monster your squad of speeder bikes is staring down; it may also be one of the many Naboo ships which are pinging incessantly on your Battle cruisers.  Your ability to determine what is the biggest threat to you will determine where you want to direct the dice.<br />
	Faster units could be selected for two primary reasons, each tied to the particular strategy and battle situation you find yourself in.  Fast units fire first, and if they manage to destroy one of your slower units it will never get the opportunity to attack.  You will often view these fast units as a threat if you are either pursuing a stall tactic with larger units in your weakest arena or simply have chosen a little more staying power versus speed in one of your primary arenas.  The negative to this is that hits can be often wasted here.  It sort of pangs the soul to roll four hits against a Battle Droid when those same four hits.  However, if you examine your dice pool statistics, which will be addressed shortly, you can take solace in the fact that while you have squandered some good luck you will also minimize bad luck later in the game.<br />
	Slower units are generally the target of your fast units, though not always.  It is not uncommon for medium-speed units to want to gain a power advantage over their slower rivals.  It is most important here to keep this biggest threat idea in your head as you plan your attacks.  A unit which attacks with 7 dice will continue to do so even if it has only one health left.  If there were a gameplay element which reflected a unit being damaged, then it would be acceptable to spread the wealth.  By focusing your firepower on this threat, as Yoda directed the troops to do in the movie, you will increase the chances of killing that unit that much faster.<br />
	A caveat hereyou must also be able to realize when the biggest threat changes.  You may have Fett on the run but your opponent has just built 2 Assassin droids that you arent particularly ready to deal with.  Be sure to know when to shift this focus and return to the next biggest threat as need be.  Sometimes your threat will shift from the fastest to the slowest unit, and sometimes it will merely be a unit with an ability that is detrimental to your strategy.  But until the need for a refocus occurs, be sure to devote all your resources to crushing that threat.<br />

&quot;In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.&quot; <br />
- Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	By now you are asking, why only focus on one threat?  Surely if I damage all units Ill have the ability to wipe them all out on a future turn at once.   The reason for this is the odds of the dice and playing them successfully.  It is easy to see that the odds of hitting are 50/50 under normal circumstances.  If you treat each dice as an individual event, you can begin to calculate an expected number of hitsmerely one-half the current number of dice you intend to roll.  To be conservative, it is often wise to round down this value so that you dont overestimate this value over time.<br />
	Why does this idea help you minimize luck?  You will be dealing with a very small sample of dice, statistically, in each game you play, and this 50/50 will not always hold true for such a small sample.  If you devote all of your dice and calculate half of that per strike, you can begin to calculate an expected kill window for your threat.  Sure, you may overdo it sometimes.  But it would be far, far worse to soften up every unit for the kill only to roll badly on the turn you want to finish off multiple targets (and allowing your soft targets to continue to pound you).  As the number of dice you roll against an individual target increases, the odds shift back toward 50/50 as outlying bad rolls and good rolls are evened out over time and sample size.<br />
	This will allow you to statistically raise the number of hits you score on a particular target, minimize a run of bad luck, and hasten that units demise.  So dont feel badly when you hit that Battle Droid four timesyou just made up for the time you wouldve rolled five dice and scored no hits against it.  Just remember you are maximizing the good rolls and minimizing the bad and this should provide some solace.<br />
	One last notethe critical hit value can skew your number of hits calculations, because there will be a 1 in 6 chance your hits for that particular dice will be doubled (or tripled, as the case may be).  You can take the time to calculate this if you want a more narrow, accurate window of expected kill time for a unit, but it will not change your need to focus on a unit and destroy it.  You can look at Critical Hit units as statistical shifters which will introduce a higher hit outlying valuein English, that just means you kill your target faster.  So turn that Jedi squad lose on that gigantic cannon!<br />

    OPPORTUNITY COSTS<br />

&quot;Victory goes to the player who makes the next-to-last mistake.&quot; <br />
- Chessmaster Savielly Grigorievitch Tartakower (1887-1956) <br />

<br />
	The last important element to consider at this level of play is what I like to dub Opportunity Costs.  In economics, this principle is defined as the cost of doing an action versus the payoff had you taken another action.  This principle applies to the Star Wars TCG because you will be dealing with a finite number of actions each turn, and you want to minimize your opportunity costs (by taking the correct, most efficient actions) and make sure your opponent ends up on the wrong side of the opportunity cost curve.<br />
	Two excellent examples of this are Jar Jar Binks and Padme, the retreating Queen.  Jar Jars ability to re-roll your opponents attack dice against him allows you to skew the odds.   Following the probability tree, you could say that your opponent would need to roll four dice to statistically kill Jar Jar (1/2 of the four dice showing hits).  However, Jar Jar would then create a new statistical event by rerolling those two dice.  Half of two dice is one hitnot enough to kill everyones (not-so-favorite) Gungan.  Nothing is more hilarious than forcing your opponent to devote a higher power character to ensure Jar Jars destruction.  If they dont, he will continually take glee in rolling his 2 attack dice and whittling away at your desired target.<br />
	The version of Padme with the take one damage and retreat is also another wonderful example of this.  She shifts the odds of attacking her to thisshe will take but one damage from your assault.  Since you need six dice to statistically guarantee the kill at once, she can play a wonderful game of forcing your opponent to essentially waste an action attacking her or allow her to continue to attack and slowly bring down more powerful units.  I mention her because she doesnt receive as much attention as some of the other Padmesand in truth, the two Rare versions have more focused and manipulative powersbut she illustrates this concept of forcing your opponent to waste his or her actions against you.<br />
	This bleeds over to your battle cards, specifically the ones that prevent damage.  Remember the idea that a unit one point of damage away from destruction still rolls just as many dice?  The idea is not to waste your damage prevention battle cards if you dont need them yet.  Why?  Because your opponent is doing some math of his own, determining when and where to attack and what units to target.  If you have two juicy targets and tip your hand too early, he will likely use this knowledge to plan his attack accordingly.  However, if you play dead, then deflect the killing blows, youve just forced him to waste several actions on a unit he had already anticipated being destroyed.  And because of the build dynamic, and how long it can take support units to arrive and increase this number of actions, the player who optimizes their finite resources the best, wasting as little as possible, will likely emerge the victor.<br />

	So, as you can see, the odds and statistical variations can be negated if you plan correctly, build your deck to encourage a solid Setup flow, keep units costed in such a manner that reinforcements are quickly available, focus your firepower to overcome a run of bad dice, and force your opponent to waste or misdirect actions.  Remember, this STILL is no foolproof way to win your gameafter all, there are times the dice just arent going to go your waybut if you learn to play the odds and make efficient use of actions and resources, watch your W column pile up as your opponents, dependent entirely on the whims of luck, are left empty handed.<br />
	Game on!  And of course.May the Force Be With You!<br />
