Once you understand the truth, and can apply it, you will have a marked advantage over those who continue to act according to the &quot;myths&quot;.  It would have been easy to devote an entire article to each of these myths, but I decided to instead consolidate all of this information into a single article.  So it will not be short, but with any luck, you&#39;ll learn something.  (maybe a few things!)  <br>
<br>
Before delving into the myths, I want to define a term.  The term is &quot;hitting odds&quot;.  Whenever you roll attack dice in this game, you miss on 1,2, or 3.  And hit on 4,5, or 6.  Since this gives you a 50/50 chance of hitting with each given die, it stands to reason that, on average, you will get 1 hit for each 2 attack dice you roll.  Those are the &quot;odds&quot;.  Within the circle of friends that I play with, any time a player scores a number of hits that are exactly half the number of dice he rolled, we call this &quot;hitting odds&quot;.  I will make several more references to &quot;hitting odds&quot; later in the article, so I just wanted to ensure that everyone will know what I am talking about.  <br>
<br>
Myth #1 - &quot;I have a 50/50 chance of hitting odds&quot;  <br>
<br>
Example:  You have a 2-power unit attacking an opposing unit with 1 health.  What is the percentage chance of you destroying the unit?  For some reason, many players think the answer is &quot;50%&quot;.  But it is not.  The dice give you 4 possible outcomes:  You will either hit with both dice, or hit with the first but miss with the second, or miss with the first but hit with the second, or miss with both dice.  What are your chances of getting exactly 1 hit?  50%.  But is that your chance of destroying the opposing unit?  No.  Because you have a 25% chance of getting TWO hits.  Therefore, your chances of getting one OR MORE hits (and destroying the opposing unit) are 75%.  The lesson learned here is that your chances of &quot;hitting odds&quot; are GOOD.  And hence, you should normally expect that level of success.  Some players make poor decisions, thinking that their chances of &quot;hitting odds&quot; are only 50/50 anyway.  Don&#39;t repeat their mistake.  In certain situations, you will be forced to hope that you can hit better than odds.  But don&#39;t attempt to hit better than odds on a regular basis, because you are destined to fail.<br>
<br>
Myth #2 - &quot;It is always better to attack a unit which has not yet attacked, than to attack one that has&quot;<br>
<br>
This is one of the biggest and most common misconceptions in the game.  People repeatedly tend to see untapped units that are preparing to attack as a big threat, while seeing tapped units that have already attacked as a minor threat. (or even no threat at all)  This is a huge mistake, and can cost them many matches.  Read through this section of the article more than once if needed, because understanding what I&#39;m about to say can lead you to victory in many games that you might otherwise lose.  Let me give you a scenario:  <br>
<br>
You are the dark side player in a game.  You have taken control of the space arena, and you currently have a droid control ship and 2 other ships there.  Your light side opponent has taken control of the character arena.  For the past several turns, you&#39;ve been fighting over the ground arena, and it is clear that whoever wins on the ground will take the game.  Neither of you have any cards in hand.  Neither of you have any units face-down that are partially built.  Time has been called in the match, which means that neither of you draw any more cards, and the game must play out to its resolution with the cards already out.  It is currently the battle phase.  In the ground arena, you have nothing but a battle droid squad, which is now 20 speed due to the droid control ship.  Your opponent has a tapped swoop bike (50 speed, 2 power, 1 health) which has just attacked and destroyed your only other unit in the ground arena, leaving the battle droid squad by itself.  Your opponent also has an untapped Rickshaw (20 speed, 2 power, 2 health) which has not attacked yet.  Since you are dark side, the battle droid squad will attack next, followed by the rickshaw.  None of the units are damaged.  So which unit should your battle droid squad attack?  the untapped rickshaw which will attack right after you do?  or the swoop bike which has already attacked and is now tapped?  I cannot begin to tell you how many players will make the wrong choice in this situation.  They will attack the Rickshaw, hoping for those 2 hits on 2 dice, and hoping to eliminate it before it gets to attack back.  Why do they do this?  Because the Rickshaw is an &quot;immediate threat&quot;.  It is going to attack right after the droid squad.  The swoop bike is tapped and will not attack this turn, hence it is only a &quot;future threat&quot;, and is viewed as less dangerous.  But it IS just as dangerous, because it will untap and attack again before the droid squad gets its next attack.  Here is another scenario, which will help to explain why people make this poor decision.  <br>
<br>
You are a soldier in the Civil War.  You are engaged in a firefight with 2 opposing soldiers.  You are behind the remains of a low wall (which was earlier blasted by cannon fire) and it is providing you with fairly good cover from enemy fire.  You are now ready to fire your weapon, and must choose which enemy soldier to fire upon.  One of the opposing soldiers is crouched behind a large tree log, and it is providing him with partial cover.  He is currently taking aim on you with his weapon, and will fire right after you do.  The other opposing soldier (who has just shot and killed your comrade) is standing behind him, reloading his weapon.  In case you hadn&#39;t noticed, you are basically the battle droid squad.  Your effective cover represents the droid squad&#39;s 3 health.  The partial cover of the soldier behind the log, represents the rickshaw&#39;s 2 health, and the soldier standing up in clear view, represents the swoop bike&#39;s one health.  The standing soldier is reloading (tapped), and is a &quot;future threat&quot; while the soldier behind the log is the &quot;immediate threat&quot;. (will attack right after you do)  Now, natural instinct tells us that we must deal with the immediate threat, and our first impulse would be to fire upon the soldier who is preparing to shoot at us NOW.  We can worry about the reloading soldier later, because he isn&#39;t an immediate threat to our continued existence.  But this reasoning is flawed.  The weapon held by the man who is reloading, is just as deadly as the one held by the man who will fire right after we do.  And since that man will fire his weapon before we can fire ours AGAIN (since we will have to reload), he is every bit as much a threat as the man behind the log.  The difference is that the man who is standing is a much easier target than the man behind the log.  By killing him, we eliminate the enemy&#39;s numerical advantage (2 against 1) and can hope that our superior cover (behind the wall instead of crouched behind a log) will give us the edge over the other soldier.  Our first instinct is not always the correct one.  But fortunately, man can reason and think.  And if we do so, we can override the natural tendency to deal with the &quot;immediate threat&quot; first.  This example gives us 2 lessons.  One:  Take the shot you can make.  Two:  Understand that the &quot;future threat&quot; is just as real as the &quot;immediate threat&quot;.  So let&#39;s go back to our SWTCG scenario and apply what we have learned.  <br>
<br>
If you attack the Rickshaw, you have a 25% chance of hitting with both dice and destroying it.  If you attack the swoop bike, you have a 75% chance of getting at least one hit, and destroying it.  Lesson One:  &quot;Take the shot you can make&quot;.  Meanwhile, regardless of which target the Battle droid squad fires upon, the unit you DON&#39;T fire upon is guaranteed to strike before the droid squad&#39;s turn comes up again.  Since both opposing units are two power, &quot;the future threat is as real as the immediate threat&quot;.  This all adds up to one thing:  Attacking the Rickshaw (which is our natural instinct, and would be the choice of MANY players) is wrong, and attacking the swoop bike is right.  So let&#39;s go through what happens in both cases (attacking one unit or attacking the other) and see what occurs, to double-check and make sure that attacking the bike is right.  These examples, for the sake of simplicity, will assume that each attack rolled will &quot;hit odds&quot;.  Not more, and not less.  This means our results will be exactly average, and guarantee that we see which decision would be correct in the majority of instances.   <br>
<br>
Example #1:  Attack the Swoop Bike.<br>
You attack the tapped swoop bike with your battle droid.  You &quot;hit odds&quot;, and get 1 hit on 2 dice.  The swoop bike is destroyed.  The rickshaw now attacks, and &quot;hits odds&quot;, getting 1 hit on 2 dice.  You add 1 damage counter to the battle droid squad, leaving it with 2 health.  The next turn comes up, and you attack the rickshaw.  you get 1 hit on 2 dice, leaving the rickshaw with 1 health.  the rickshaw attacks again, getting 1 hit on 2 dice.  Your battle droid now has 2 damage counters, and 1 health remaining.  Next turn, you attack the rickshaw, get 1 hit on 2 dice, destroy the rickshaw, and win the game.  <br>
<br>
Example #2:  Attack the Rickshaw<br>
You attack the untapped rickshaw with your battle droid.  You &quot;hit odds&quot;, and get 1 hit on 2 dice, leaving the rickshaw with one health.  The rickshaw now attacks you, getting 1 hit on 2 dice, leaving the battle droid with 2 health.  The next turn begins, and the swoop bike attacks first.  it gets 1 hit on 2 dice, leaving the battle droid with 1 health.  the battle droid now attacks.  Each opposing unit now has only 1 health.  You can get 1 hit on 2 dice, and destroy either one.  But regardless of which one you destroy, the other will attack before your droids attack again.  Assuming that whichever unit you did not destroy, gets 1 hit on 2 dice, it will add the 3rd damage counter to your battle droid squad.  You lose the game. <br>
<br>
If you knew all along that attacking the tapped swoop bike, and NOT the untapped rickshaw was the choice that leads to victory, while the other choice leads to defeat, and knew WHY, then congratulations.  You are way ahead of the average person you will compete against in this game.  If you didn&#39;t know, and might have gone for the kill on the untapped unit, don&#39;t feel bad.  Many players would do the same thing.  But NOW you know better.  And if you can apply what you&#39;ve learned from this article in your future games, you will reap the benefits.  <br>
<br>
Myth #3:  &quot;Swarming my opponent with cheap units will lead me to victory&quot;<br>
<br>
Due to the popularity (and effectiveness) of swarm decks in some other card games (including Magic the Gathering and SWCCG), many players automatically assume that swarm decks can work in SWTCG as well.  They figure that by putting out hordes of smaller units, they can keep throwing damage at their opponent, and the opposing units will not be able to eliminate the pesky swarmers fast enough to avoid destruction.  There are two reasons why they are wrong.  The first reason is that larger units often have built-in damage prevention.  either in the form of an evade ability, or in the form of shields.  This allows larger units to overcome swarms of smaller ones, without the additional need for any battle or mission cards as help.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
3 n-1 starfighters (total build cost: 6) vs. 1 Commerce Guild Starship (build cost: 4)  <br>
Assuming everything &quot;hits odds&quot;, the n-1 starfighters would all attack, dealing an average of 1.5 damage total.  The DS ship would attack, destroying one of the n-1s.  The other 2 n-1s would then attack, dealing 1 damage on average.  The DS ship attacks, destroying another of the N-1s.  The last N-1 now attacks, dealing .5 damage, on average.  the total damage against the DS ship is now 3.  But it has 4 health, and survives to destroy the last N-1.  So, even though the DS used only 4 build points and 1 card, instead of 6 build points and 3 cards, the DS still came out ahead, because of shields.  <br>
<br>
But the main reason why swarm decks won&#39;t work in SWTCG is because the smaller units are NOT always faster.  In the space arena, the smaller units are generally faster, while the capital ships attack last.  There are only a few exceptions to this rule.  In the ground arena, however, this is not necessarily the case.  The At-te walkers are large units that also attack very quickly, meaning they could handle swarms without much trouble at all.  The speeder bike squadrons are mid-ranged units, but are also very fast.  Even the Republic gunships (which are massive 6 power, 6 health units) have a very respectable 40 speed, as do the Destroyer Droid Squads, which are 5 power and 5 health.  Meanwhile, there are some smaller, 2 cost units that are very slow (like the Battle droid squad and the Senatorial Escort)  The fact that one of the At-te walkers also has shields only makes things worse.  In Character arena, things are even more against a swarm deck.  The big, powerful &quot;mains&quot; not only often have evade abilities, but also have higher speed ratings than the smaller characters.  But how does the change in speed really change things?  Well, if we have 3 small, 2-power units against one slow, 6-power unit in space, with each side paying 6 build points total (say, 3 n-1 starfighters vs. a techno union starship), we expect the following to occur:<br>
<br>
The 3 fast ships attack first, and &quot;hit odds&quot;, dealing 3 damage.  The big ship attacks, destroying 1 of the small ships.  The 2 remaining fast ships attack, &quot;hit odds&quot;, and deal 2 damage.  The big ship attacks, destroying a 2nd of the small ships.  The last small ship attacks, &quot;hits odds&quot;, and destroys the big ship.  Swarm wins.  <br>
<br>
However, if we move to the character arena, and put 3 small, 2-power units against one 6-power unit, with each side paying 6 build points (say, 3 naboo security guards vs. Jango Fett B), the following occurs instead:<br>
<br>
Jango attacks, killing one of the guards.  The other 2 guards attack, hit odds, and deal 2 damage to fett.  Jango attacks, killing another guard.  The last guard attacks odds, and deals 1 damage to fett.  Jango attacks, and clears the arena.  Swarm loses.  <br>
<br>
Things would have only been worse if the big unit had also had an evasion ability.  As you can see, swarm won&#39;t work in this game if it doesn&#39;t attack FIRST.  And the smaller units normally will attack first in space, but that isn&#39;t always the case on ground, and definitely isn&#39;t the case in the character arena.  And that is why true &quot;swarm decks&quot; are not good in SWTCG at this point.  <br>
<br>
Any player becomes stronger if he can overcome his own mental blocks, and stop clinging to his myths.  I hope this article has been worthwhile for you.
