Until then it would be best if you refrained from canceling or modifying your travel plans.<br>
 <br>
At this point it appears that there is a real possibility of having Worlds 2001. Check back here on Wednesday for more information. <hr><b>comments</b><hr>Pär B said on Fri Oct 5 2001 <br>Thank you this realy is great.<hr>rob said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>why is decktech to run worlds? is decipher not going to? what happened to the 50000 in prizes?<hr>bob said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>decipher isnt going to, read the front page of their site.  the 50000 is gonna be donated.<hr>Baroni said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>Neal, Davod everyone else who runs decktech this is truly a great thing that you guys are trying to do.

Although D has said that the 50K in prizes will be donated, they did say that there would be a survey of world qualifiers to see which charities it goes to.  Maybe the winners could chose where an amount equivalent to what they would've won will go.  It's not great, but at least they get the acknowledgement of winning and the level of prizes that they would've gotten.<hr>Martin Akesson said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>absolutely great. thank you.<hr>Gadget said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>well, whether or not you pull this off, thanks for trying and giving us some hope. as a long time player, it's good to see that someone still cares about the players.<hr>Austin "Jedi Jawa" Rivera said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>Decktech is the reason SWCCG is still around.  LONG LIVE DECKTECH.<hr>Steve "Mock" Hennel said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>I knew this would become a possibility...the minute I heard D-Con was cancelled I said to my friend Greg, "Hey, I bet DeckTech will try to pick up the World Championship." You guys are what's keeping the game going. <hr>Jeebs said on Sat Oct 6 2001 <br>Although i personally wouldnt be able to go, the fact that you guys are even attempting to pull this off is brilliant. Decktech is the main reason this game is still going like it is, i just wanted to say good luck on getting together a great event!<hr>Darryll said on Sun Oct 7 2001 <br>god u guys are the freaking cool and awesome and I knew that I could count on you guys to come through and pick up Deciphers peces and make them look BAD...!!!! <hr>Alpha Blue said on Sun Oct 7 2001 <br>Guess what? We're bombing the shyte out of Afghanistan. Could a player pick to donate money to DeckTech?<hr>Powers209 said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I think its a great idea. I hope decktech can pull it off.I'm sorry I wont be able to go.  but I think the worlds should be held. decipher's bail out of the worlds is against everything we should be doing. even the Prez said its up to us to live are lives as normal. Not have the worlds is like giving in to the terrorist, letting them win. <br>
weather report for Afghanistan: possibility of raining bombs, with a good chance of blowing the hell out of the taliban.<hr>Fulcrum said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>That is great you are doing this but... I don't like the idea about all these guys gettin bent outta shape and only mattering about the money.  This is a game afterall... not a living.  If u don't like my coments please feel free to email me.<hr>don ertan said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>my doantion money goes to decktech. it deserves more than any company i have seen. nice job decktech...<hr>jux said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>you guys are making it seem as if decipher is bad for canceling the decipher con. they did it mainly for the safety of the players.  you guys need to stop saying that decktech is the sole credit for keeping the game alive.
