What is this weekend event you say?  It's a DPC special event just for <b>Magi Nation Duel</b>.  At the storyline tournaments the week end of December 21, you will be attending in Huntsville Alabama, Sandy Utah and Livingston NJ, the first REAL workout of Voice.  That's right <b>simultaneos DPC's in THREE CITIES</b> to show that Magi Nation Duel is the hottest game around.  This is a <b>DPC First</b>, simultaneous tournaments!<br>
<br>
And thanks to three gentleman's efforts, and the DPC, there will be special prizes.  Oh yes, very special indeed.<br>

If any wars or rings or good DTers in Huntsville got a place to play other than Dr. Bob's that weekend... get in contact with him pronto<hr>Cortney Haggerty said on Fri Dec 6 2002 <br>matt j is a bear.  <hr>Gerald Andrews said on Sat Dec 7 2002 <br>What's wrong with Dr. Bob's? I've never been there so I don't know, but from what I understand it's probably the best known location for MND in AL.<hr>Law Sterling said on Sun Dec 8 2002 <br>Bob's closed shop on Thursday; I'm checking with Haven Comics, located on the Huntsville/Madison border, to see what we can work out.<hr>Jennifer Cuthbert said on Fri Dec 13 2002 <br>Haven Comics will host the DPC event for Huntsville on December 21st.
