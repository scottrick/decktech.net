<b>This is far away from me, how do I get there?</b><br />
Near Bensheim we have Fraport (Airport of Frankfurt / Main), which is one of the biggest airports in the world. Of course we have Frankfurt / Hahn as well, if you travel on low-cost airlines, like RyanAir - unfortunately, we don't get any money for this ad. If you need any information about hotels, e-mail Nico at: Tusken84[at]aol.com.<br />

<b>Can I do any sightseeing there?</b><br />
Heidelberg, Worms (!this is a really old city!), Speyer, Frankfurt, Cologne, Mainz, Munich, Koblenz („Deutsches Eck“), Loreley, Maastricht (Netherlands, where all the devices and weapons are legal), Stuttgart, Ramstein, Kaiserslautern, Landstuhl, Black Forest... are not far away from Bensheim (between 2 and 3.5 hours of driving, depends where you want to go)!<p><small>edited by scott on Wed Sep 17 2008 </small><hr><b>comments</b>
