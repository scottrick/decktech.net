<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Attention All Females: Want to be a DT Calendar Girl? posted by DeckTech on Wed May 29 2002 <br>With the introduction of new games Magi Nation Duel and Lord of the Rings, DeckTech.net is seeing something new lately: Girls.<br>
<br>
Due to a wacky idea followed by several requests and a few initial volunteers, DeckTech is planning on having a 6 month downloadable calendar featuring 6 girls from DeckTech!  This calendar will have various dates such as holidays and DPC or Convention info, and of course inluce a picture of the girl for the month.<br>
<br>
Now this is not a chauvinistic or exploitative venture, it is merely a chance to be part of something fun, if you so choose.<br>
<br>
If you are interested, send an email to project head <a href="mailto:alex@decktech.net">Alex Tennet</a> to see about joining.<br>
<br>
Multiple pictures for each person are fine, but only one of each person will be selected so that a maximum of people can participate.  In the event that there are many participators, 6 will be selected randomly, with some filtering due to picture quality.  It is open to all ages, races, whatever.<br>
<br>
So ladies, get your pictures ready and gain thousands of worshipful fans as part of the DeckTech Calendar!<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed May 29 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Ok, I'll be the first to admit, this is a crazy idea, even for us!  But hey, that's DT, we do crazy stuff.<br>
<br>
I think it'll be a lot of fun, and I look forward to having more girls involved in DT.  It's a real pleasant change.<br>
<br>
ok, discuss away.<hr>Adam Drake said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Hey yo... <br>
<br>
Does the girl have to be a member of DT? Cuz I know that there are a few members (myself included) who have to have attractive GFs and/or wives who could spice up a calendar... Just a thought.<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>This is hilarious. :)<br>
--Lisa<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>I know it's pretty wacky, isn't it?  Lisa you sending a pic?<hr>Hannah Grimm said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>sure, why not?<br>
<hr>matt wehner said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>I have a picture of my dog I can submit.  she's gotta be better looking than some females I've seen play this game.  Except for Tiuli "ICE HEART" Anfossi - I'd put her up as my calander girl any day.....<hr>Brian Connolly said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>This is the first I've been back to DT in 9  months and I'm appalled by the chauvinist attitude. <br>
Incidentally, can u get the chicks to dress up as Arwen or Rosie Cotton? <hr>Charlie Herren said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I actually thought this was a joke.. :p<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>You guys might wanna remember that posting pictures of any minor without legal consent from their parents is a Class A Felony in most states, don't want some random parents suing DT :)<hr>Alex Tennet said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Just so everyone is clear, this is not my idea at all - it's actually Neal's (I wouldn't want to take the credit Neal, people should know where this blatant chauvanism comes from :). However I will indeed be accepting these submissions for use in DT's 2002 calendar. So if you want to see yourself alongside famous birds such as Kim Caton, Heidi Farinholt and Andie "McDowell" Howard of #1 player fame, please email. Letters of disgust should still go to neal@decktech.net however...(Disclaimer: one of the above listed lovely ladies may not appear for reasons of taste, decency and class A felony lawsuits).<hr>Mark Balderston said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>this made me laugh real hard.  heheh.  seriously, if people want to look at hot chicks, they don't visit LOTR:TCG sites.  Cheers<hr>Tim Guzman said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>One young lady, that will take the cake, plays here in Vegas.  Her name is Suann...She should send a picture.<hr>Matt Townend said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>man, I wish Natalie Portman was on Deck Tech.  *sobs*<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Guys, this is fun.  That's all.<br>
<br>
And for the record, I come up with a dumb idea like 100 times a day.  <b>Alex Tennet</b> *is* the one who pursued the dumb idea and convinced me to do it!<br>
<br>
And andrew, well, to forget something you have to have known it first.  I never heard that, are you sure that's the case?<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>What...you guys weren't kidding Neal? :)<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Yeah, I'm sure, its a federal law part of the Internet Privacy Act or whatever they called it. Anyone under the age of 18 is protected from having their image posted on the internet without the express written consent of their legal guardian, as well as no child under 14 can give out their personal information without the same verification from their parents/guardian(s).<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Tuili and Myriam and the 2 pretiest girl playing card<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I look like a girl, and I like boys, can I take part of that contest ?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>ahhhhhhhhh how come the name i had writen ( jimmy chen ) changed to dominic gaudreault... <hr>Mike Humphries said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>  this all sounds fine and dandy...  however i think the alternate approach would work better...  instead of hot girls, you should take pictures of different shop owners arround the country...m kinda like the 7-UP truck drivers commercial...  just a thought<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Anyhow, out of curiosity I looked up the law on photographs and info gathering of minors and children through the internet.  Children, of course, are under 13 and there are parental consent restrictions.  However, there are no restriction to minors, it's not even bothered to be defined in the section.  Also, FL statutes had nothing either.<br>
<br>
If someone has any info to the contray, please contact either I or alex.<hr>christian cinder said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>This has been done before by gaming magazines: why not poll for our favorite CCG,TCG femmes. Of course, you'll have to secure the copyrights-but I feel this might be better than player photos.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>that suggestion while interesting, is not even feasable.<hr>Jeff Peck said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>hahaha Dominic you like boys?  when are you going to play this game again? soon you wont be in the canada top 3.  and why does that guy want pictures of shop owners?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>hehe i dont care ... ill just do good at a big tournement and that will put me in top 3 ... anyways we wont get any sponsor for canada ... so i have no motivation for rating... and as for boy yes i like them ... well actualy its more of a inside between my friends ... there is a player call jimmy chen and he is gay ... and he like us alot... i wanted to write that with his name but ... we cant use fake name :(  it changes back to our real name :(<hr>Chris Cicconi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I think we know why that guy wants to see card store owners....probably one of that Jimmy Chen guys "friends".<hr>Myriam Gimaiel said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>dom u ll work and u ll have the money for go there... u must go there if u do the top 3.          i am happy to learn u are gay  ;)<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Dom is gay?  I didn't know that.  I thought he was making some crazy joke or something.  I thought he had a girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Oh well, Dom you are still me hero, gay or not.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Dom is gay?  I didn't know that.  I thought he was making some crazy joke or something.  I thought he had a girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Oh well, Dom you are still my hero, gay or straight.<hr>Henry Jicha said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>6 at random is wrong.  Should be 5 at random and Tiuli.<hr>jason baretta said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>while it does seem like a funny idea, doesn't it strike anyone else as a little sad?<hr>Myriam Gimaiel said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>i think its very funny .... why peaple  ll be sad for that ??? <hr>jason baretta said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>you don't think the idea of 10 000 DT members, ogling you while they clutch thier 'flaming brands' is kinda perverted?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>hehe no , sorry :) i aint ... unfortunatly for us jimmy chen might be ... i dont care ... but he is always toutching our body when we are playing a lotr game... its hard to concentrate. hi neal<hr>Jeff Peck said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>why does everbody want tiuli to be in this?  i am reporting all of you to her mommy.  take that.  speaking of gay, i heard a rumor that somebody with the initials J I is gay too.  i wonder who he is.  hey dom kick that guy in the nuts.  wait... he may enjoy that.  nevermind.  plus i read your page.  dont you love the canadian government, they sure know how to spend our money.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Hey I just want to get The Finger to a group of LAMEplayers who are crying abuot the calendar and calling it sexist.<br>
<br>
Me sexist, right.  Everyone is always saying i'm far too left wing, now i'm a right wing oppressor.<br>
<br>
If anyone is sexist it's people like a scrub named Chen who are paternalists.  Yeah, you heard me chump, paternalistic.  You think woman can't decide for themselves what they want to do?  Gee, thanks defender of the faith.  Maybe you can make women dress the way you think also.  Why don't you dress them in a burqua, then they'll have to listen to you.  YOU are the sexist.<br>
<br>
Guess, what dorks, it's America.  People are allowed to do and say and think what they want.  You should be thankful for that, cause that's the only way you get to spout your mangled, unintelligent tripe.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>why do you have to go and say sexism is reserved by the right-wing oppressors? those who are truly right wing believe in individual freedoms.<br><br>take it back :)<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Many right winger certainly do respect individual freedoms.  Evan and I may not agree on health care, envt, or many other things, but he is a staunch defender of personal liberties.<hr>jason wade said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Neal. I love your ideas. They make decktech different from every other game commutity out there. But this idea is...well might be a little over the edge for a ccg gaming community. Granted that most ppl who play ccg are smart and responsable ppl and are of an older age. But I have recommended this site to many ppl including my friends who I play ccg's with that are under the age of 12. I am not say this is a bad idea. Just take a look at the picture before you put it up and make sure nobody would get the wrong impression about the picture and flame at decktech about it. Later decktech<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>I hear you Jason.  These pics aren't lewd or anything.  Just a smiling face of a girl from DT.  It's nothing raunchy<hr>John Anderson said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Have to jump in to defend the fellow "oppressors". Personal liberties are a big factor in my political philosphies. Sexism is not, just as Evan put it, "sexism is reserved by the right-wing oppressors". Anyway, Neal, did you see Frank Rich's latest Times Op column? Watch this: one of the few times I will agree to a slightly more left standpoint. Check it out in the link.<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Sounds like fun, something different.I'll support it.<hr>Marc Urrutia said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>If the ladies are willing to submit photos, why not post em. <br>
<br>
Maybe we should ask them, what they would like to see?  Though I fear the answer would be Orlando Bloom!<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Haha...Lego's pretty cute, but I like Elrond better. ;)<br>

Dunno why...maybe I've just been seduced by his wisdom. :)<hr>John Rowe said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>Alright now, why has not anyone spoken up for the guys?  Why don't we put the whole "sexist" issue to rest by having DT Boys as well?  I, for one, would be willing to challenge any DT guy to a posedown or two!
