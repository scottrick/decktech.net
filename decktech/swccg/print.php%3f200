<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>The #1 Card Game in the world comes to the #1 Card Network on the net - Magic: The Gathering coming to DeckTech posted by DeckTech on Tue Jun 11 2002 <br>After countless emails of request, DeckTech is happy to announce the latest addition to our network, the legend itself, <b>Magic: The Gathering</b><br>
<br>
Created by <b>Dr. Richard Garfield</b> in the early 1990's, Magic has been the benchmark by which all CCGs, TCGs, companies, decks, and players are measured.  The grandfather of all CCG's, Magic has withstood the test of time, and stands tall in doing so.<br>
<br>
After long testing of the DeckTech network and it's technology, we at DT now feel we are ready to bring you all and the Magic community a quality service equal to the #1 game of all time.<br>
<br>
The release of Magic is planned for the weekend of July 12 to co incide with <b>Alan Denny's</b> outstanding multi game DPC in Houston.<br>
<br>
Look for more details soon, and announcement of prizes for contests as we gear up for this landmark event.<br>

- Neal<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jun 11 2002 <br>I have to admit, i am really excited.  What a great game.<hr>Tim Guzman said on Tue Jun 11 2002 <br>This should be great.  Right now, I have been a little busy playing Magic Online, it is a new program with playing it online for cool prize, and sanctioned events.  Lots of fun.<hr>Craig Teppert said on Tue Jun 11 2002 <br>It's about time!<hr>Matthew Ley said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Not as happy - the 800 pound gorilla has arrived!  But understandable.  Why wouldn't DT cater to a game that has more players than all 5 that are currently here?<br>
<br>
Good luck!<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>We just want to have something for everyone.  To be honest, a lot of lord of the rings players play magic.  Guys like Yannick and Adam Beauchamp and Evan Fitzgerald come immediately to mind.<hr>Robert dayton said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>i thought decktech was a place that was magic free. sure it had comercials for magic, but that is just business. sure it had prize support from WotC, but why would you turn down free stuff? i thought they wouldnt sell out, and have that bore of a game on DT, but oh well.<br>
all good things come to an end.<br>
whatever<hr>Bert Claessen said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Et tu, Brute.<br>
Too bad, another site being corrupted by the dark ways of Magic.<hr>Fernando Medalón said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Agree with both Robert and Bert<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Um, people, this is easy. If you're not into Magic(like myself), don't click on the link...<hr>John Noonan said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I also agree with Robert and Bert...magic doesn't need to be on decktech.  But I also agree with Matt that if you don't like magic...don't click the link.  I know I won't.<hr>jason wade said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Hmmmmmmm do I see a trend here. First the new wotc starwars and now magic........I personaly don't like the idea of bring the magic community up to decktech neal. Like you said before wotc and decipher ppl have a long history of bickering and fighting between them. Bringing magic to decktech might cause serveral long arguments involing both sides.... By the way on a side note, LOTR has out done magic now for active players playing the game every week and in product sales. I don't beleive they are number one anymore. Later decketch<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I agree with Bert and Ernie as well. We should hate and fear those who play Magic for no logical reason. Making Decktech section for the mother of all CCGs, one that one of the webmasters here enjoys makes no sense. Magic players (especially Pro ones) have no new perspective or knowledge to bring here, and are moronic assholes.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Anyone who thinks Magic is bad for DT, it's members, or even Decipher is dead wrong.  Magic has some of the best card players in the world.  That can only help all the games here, and all the players here, with good reviews, quality decks, high standards etc.<br>
<br>
You think lord of the rings is a good game right?  Then let free market prevail, and let everyone see all the games.  Don't try to censor one out of fear.  If lotr is good, then it has nothing to fear, esp if it's the #1 game as you claim.<br>
<br>
And guess what.  Three guys who don't like Magic, or even 10 guys don't stop 1000 people who do.  I want to give  the people here what they want.  And personally, I like Magic.  A lot.<br>
<br>
Stop being such Decipher cattle and grow up.  just cause Decipher doesn't like Magic, doesn't mean you shouldn't.<br>
<br>
I play lord of the rings and Magic for instance.  And I played Pokemon and star wars, star wars better than 90% of you.  So don't tell the rest of us what we can and can't like.<hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I will just throw my two cents in here.<br>
<br>
I will be the first to stand up and say I can not stand WotC or the way they do business.  They are a corporate monster that supports "the man" and only making a dollar.  They are backed by Hasbro and George "screw the players" Lucas who both think the same way.  George way have created the SW universe but in realitymore of us live in it than he will ever realize.  If it was not for all of the above mentioned people we would have had reflections gold, or WotC could have bought the rites to Deciphers game and made everyone happy.<br>
<br>
I will say the first ccg game I ever played was Magic.  I enjoyed it and even became a level 2 judge for them for a while.  I have gotten in and out of Magic several times and I like the game itself.  I only buy the older cards and singles so I do not support WotC I support my local card shop.<br>
<br>
We are all going to play what we like.  Hell SWCCG is the game and the one I will love forever and never get in and out of.  Decipher is "IMHO" a great company I know alot of the guys there and do a ton of stuff to help Decipher.  I will play this as long as I have someone to play against.  My son is two and I can't wait for him to get the age to enjoy the game the way I did.  You know what I may even let him play Magic.<br>
<br>
See you all in July.<hr>John Noonan said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Hey Neal...last time i checked...the comment section was there to post your thoughts...not to have them rebuted by someone who considers us decipher cattle.<br>
<br>
We'll stop being decipher cattle as soon as you stop being a WotC buttweasel (thank you inquest for finding this unique word to apply to people like this) <br>
<br>
If you don't want us to tell you what we like and don't like, and don't want our opinions here...then post that comments must be positive warm fuzzy comments at all times...or don't make a comment section.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Hey noonan, don't tell me what to do.  I'll do what the hell i want.<br>
<br>
I don't need idiotic input, that doesn't help me at all.<br>
<br>
don't smart off to me again, boy<hr>John Noonan said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Oh my, did I make you spaz again neal...I'm sorry...<br>
<br>
you go ahead and do what you want to do if that makes you feel better. <br>
<br>
And frankly, the only idiotic input I see around here...well, you just posted it.<hr>Andreas Petz said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>well there goes the 'quality' in decktech...<hr>Alan Sagan said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I don't see why everyone's bitching.. I haven't played Magic in about 7 years (feeling Star Wars to be far superior), but as far as strategy goes, Magic is head over heels on Lotr (mostly because of timing).  Am I a competitive magic player?  no, nor do i support the game.. I'm not saying it's more strategic cause I like it, I don't.. it just is.  <br>
I was under the impression decktech didn't do magic because there already was a big site like this out there for it...<hr>Hannah Grimm said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>God, what is wrong with you people?  It's quite possible to play and like more than one CCG.  Magic is a great game, and will always be the standard by which other games are judged, so deal with it.  LotR is also a great game, so deal with it.  You people are such morons, except for Neal, who has the decency to realize that just cause wizards is successful doesn't mean there games suck.  I'm a fan of both decipher and wizards games, and I have no conflicting loyalties.<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I think it's pretty funny that people think that Decktech is going to shyte now because it is going to be including MTG.. I doubt you'll see any reduction in content from the other sections of the site. DT isn't selling out. DT isn't going to ditch the other games at all. If you're biased enough to think that the inclusion of MTG or WOTC games in general is going to make this site terrible, then just don't click the links to the MTG/SWTCG sections.<br>
<br>
Decipher can't compete with WOTC. You saw it with the SW license, and Decipher lost out. While Decipher may be a great company (to some, but not in my opinion), WOTC is a better -business-. In the end, money is all that matters to either.<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>And as for MTG sites, there are only really a few left out there, with the best one being the WOTC-sponsored sideboard.com. <hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Anyone who would say that the addition of ANY game to DT is bad, is a complete Moron.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>oh and noonan i will do what i want.  wait till you try to log in.  No name scrub with 3 accounts.  I should have banned you for that.<hr>Will Dean said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Ok time for my two worthless cents.<br>
<br>
Magic is a fun game do I play it? Yes some. Is it worthy of DT? I am not qulified to make that descion. What I do know however is that I like Decipher and their games (SW and rings) ALOT. Now some of you may call me a Decipher cattle but be that as it may I will unbaisly point out some good and bad piont of Magic and it coming to DT. <br>
     Pros<br>
1. Great support from Wizards in big tourments always have always will. If rings had that it would do alot for Decipher.<br>
2. Some very fun stratgeys and lots of boring ones. I have this counter spell deck nothing you play every hits the table it is very frusterating. Lotr is limited in stratgey because it is rather new but with more sets it will get better.<br>
<br>
   Cons<br>
1.Christians like my dad think it is of the devil. Damn Pit Lord If any of you want the story dmail me.<br>
2. Just when you finally get the cards for your ultimate killer deck the current block rotates out of type2 and you have to start all over again. grrr.<br>
<br>
   What It will do for DeckTech.<br>
<br>
1.Bring more people to it and maybe even convert to one of the other games on this site. <br>
2Get decktech more money. I think I can say with alomst cirtianly that Neal and David lose money keeping this great site up. I'm also sure that Decipher doesn't give them any help. WOTC will as we have already seen with the free Darth Vader and I am confident that they will give more support to the site.<br>
<br>
Now balnce everyting out and I think Magic will overall help DeckTech.<br>
These are simply my opinons and observations. If you disagree with them fine if you agree with them also fine. Neal I hope WOTC wil help out with contest and such and you can definitly count on me submitting a deck or two when the site is up.<br>
<hr>jason wade said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Neal, you are right this is your site and you can so as you please with it....an additional card game to this site is always good.....but what you are doing is puttig 2 MAJOR competers against one another on decktech. Bringing main stream WOTC players trying to have us "scrubs" to them critize there decks.. is unlikly.I used to play magic until they started to reprint the same cards over and over. Then I lost interest and put more money into starwars. By the way Charlie, in inquest gaming magazie deciphers gross income on lotr vs ALL wotc products is over 2:1 decipher over wotc. I believe at this point decipher is better off than wotc considering that is only one of deciphers products and not including startrek and what ever is left of old wars. I truly beleive decipher can compete and beat wotc in making money.<hr>Nathan Friedman said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>The Decipher vs WotC war is not what it used to be.  LotR was a gamble on Decipher's part, but it was one they had to make to stay alive.  It paid off for them bigtime.  Now WotC will have to try to top Decipher.  SWTCG isn't enough.  <br>
<br>
I think this is a great move.  It'll be cool for a lot of us DTers who also play Magic.  I think some of the people above are right to be a little concerned by all the Magic-only people that will be coming to Decktech now.  There will be a lot, and their attitudes will be a lot different from what we are used to seeing here.  I seriously doubt we are going to see any Magic-only players pick up some of the other games here, but anything's possible.  This isn't selling out the other games on DT to Magic, but I would hope there will be the same level of quality in the new Magic section as in the other sections.<br>
<br>
I also hope that, even though WotC will provide appreciated support, Decktech remains "For the players, By the players".<hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Frankly guys, you really need to chill out, it's not wise to get Neal mad :) But seriously, I don't like WOTC(they make 99% craptastic games, and one good one) and I am not a fan of Magic(although I played it for a while), but it only makes sense to have the largest TCG on DT, since it is the best resource for TCGs on the web. This really isn't the place for some debate about which company is better, because I suppose each have their strong points, it's all personal opinion and you're not gonna be convincing anyone. Play the game you like, support the company you want, and most of all, click on the links that you CHOOSE :)<hr>Gustaf Olson said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>I just have one thing to say about WotC. They pursue the cash cow god above the players interest. For that reson alone I am a fan of Decipher Products. I spent over 3K on Battletech cards back in the day. FASA and WotC skirmishes resulted in the death of FASA....a very very sad day. Wizkids has no chance at the Battletech game mechanics since it is a Garfield game and he won't sell it to them. I would hate to see somthing of this magnitude happen here....<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Decipher is a "one trick pony." Right now, they have LOTR, which is the #1 selling CCG/TCG on the market. WOTC, on the other hand, has multiple CCG/TCGs (some good, lots bad), then stuff like multiple RPGs, Magic Online, and various other products, then there's really no comparison.<br>
<br>
As for possible conflicting attitudes, MTG players have the same attitude towards others as other CCG players, but to a larger scale. Yes, there are lots of MTG-playing assholes, but there are also a whole lot of MTG players who aren't.. I don't think there'd be a big problem, IMO.<hr>Dean Richmond said on Wed Jun 12 2002 <br>Who didn't see this coming???  First the WOTC ads then the wholehearted support of SW TCG (which totally blows), and now an open embrace of WOTC with a new Magic site.  I can totally understand why DT went this route to get more site hits and advertising $$$, and perhaps even corporate sponsonship down the road.  However; I fear that the Empire has finally invaded the last Rebel Base.  I fear things will change in the future on DT and we will all see like Lando that This Deal is Getting Worse All the Time.  WOTC has no problem destroying independent operations and if it chooses some day it will kill DT too to get players to return to its sites...perhaps by some day offering Neal etc a Deal they can't refuse. <hr>Erich Hawbaker said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>And now for something completely different...<br>
<br>
First let me say that I have played both MTG and SWCCG, and that they are both good games in their respective ways (I also liked Battletech, but that never really caught on...) Before I go any further, let me also say that I, like many of us, will never accept WotC's SW game as our own, and will continue to be loyal to Decipher and hope for the day when our game lives once again. By that way, thanks a mil to George "@#$! the fans" Lucas and to WotC for causing all this by not making the new game compadible with the old.<br>
All that having been said, I see no problem with adding MTG to DT. All of us with SWCCG still have our space too, don't we? MTG players aren't to blame for what Lucas and WotC did. They, like us, love their game, have a good deal of money tied up in it, and should have just as much right to have it on DT as we do. What Lucas and WotC did was disgraceful, but the players of WotC's games aren't at fault for that (unless they gave up SWCCG for SWTCG).  <br>
<br>
KEEP THE GAME ALIVE, MY FRIENDS!!! IT WILL ONLY DIE IF WE LET IT!!!     <hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>I love star wars ccg, and am planning on supporting it till the bitter end.<hr>Blake Edmondson said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>I really dislike the anti-WOTC people on this site.  I originally started playing Magic then also started playing Star Wars.  I am not going to join the debate on which one is better (I will not even post my opinion in these parenthasis).  The fact is I like being able to come to one amazing site and see multiple games offered.  By the way, Decipher does not outsell WOTC for one reason, Magic.  No matter how much you hate it, it is the #1 card game right now and always has been because it sells more (not saying it is best, but sells more)  There is one reason for this advantage, longevity.  Magic has more players than all Decipher games combined by at least 5 to 1 if not more.  I don't know where dude got the figures on LOTR outselling all WOTC products, but that is ridiculus.  It is a great game (I play this more than even Magic right now), but it does not have the fan base Magic does.<br>
Just another two cents to add to the mix.<hr>Tim Guzman said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>A lot of these post make little sense.  So if you don't like a game, then don't click on the link.  DT is a great site, that gamers from all games could benefit from.  Personally I never click on Star Trek, or MND, because I don't play those games.  Do you get it...don't click on the link if you don't like it.  DT growing is a good thing.  The bigger it gets, the longer it sticks around.  Hey even those guys at GPN, covers all types of games including MTG, and for some strange of the wall reason Big D uses them a lot.  Why, do you ask?  Well because with more games you cover more players who might be interested in other games.  Anyway, that is it for now.  I don't think I made sense, but I am never shocked anymore by the things, many people say or post anymore...(no sense).<hr>Henry Jicha said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>One thing:  please, if you are going to do this, which I really don't mind as a concept, get another server machine or two.  Decktech has been tough enough lately to navigate successfully, and an MTG flood will reduce things to a crawl if that.<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>"I love star wars ccg, and am planning on supporting it till the bitter end. <br>
Neal Razi - Thu Jun 13 2002  "<br>
<BR><br>
<BR><br>
I think this says a lot about how you still support, & how this site supports, SWCCG.  No one should doubt your loyalty to both games.  I've never played Magic & SWCCG is the only game in town for me, but Tim's right--if Magic or MN, or STCCG, isn't your thing, you don't have to click.  Simple! :)  Thanks for letting me have my two cents.<br>
<hr>christian cinder said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>A long time ago...in a city called Seattle, there was a young idealistic games company who had the grand fortune of meeting a simple mathmetician named Richard Garfield.  Soon this company grew and ate another long revered gaming company who had grown decadent and complacent (may their copyright practices forever be remembered as how not to treat their creative staff).  But as Master Qui-Gon once said, "There's always a bigger fish."  This young, idealistic, quickly-growing company caught the eye of the Emporor of toys and was soon baught out as well. This is the way...the will...of the Force.<br>
<br>
I like all games...even mind-numbingly slow, ploding ones like SW:CCG (my 2 cents) or quick brutally competitve ones like M:tG.  <br>
What I don't like is fear of change.  The last time I witnessed such a cowardly display of alarmistism was when the LISCENCE changed hands. Did anyone ever think that Lucas didn't want his ideal portrayed the way Decipher did? Limiting the game to only those with the financial level and collector contacts to afford the cards that win. Or making the game so complex so that few will ever truely understand all the errata.  What better way to use the force than with a little luck.  SW wasn't just about Jedi, it was about heroes, even the blaster- wieldeing, card-playing-gambling scoundrells who relied on luck.  <br>
<br>
DeckTech should reflect this as well.  It's a great site with a very open-minded staff and a wealth of truely interested players. Allowing M:tG to come here will be a benefit for us all. But, there will always be those who do not, will not or can not acknowledge from whom their present comes from.  It's good to not always look back-but don't forget to look ahead and never forget where you are or where you came from. <br>
<br>
'nuf said.<hr>Ryan Fojtik said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>first lemme say its nice to read this site again, its grown into a quite amazing place.  <br>
<br>
second, most of you are missing something.  the thing that makes decktech superior to other sites dealing with CCGs (even imo, the old dojo and sideboard.com) is the fact that it allows so many people to share knowledge in a constructive way.  It allows the players of the games on the site to build and grow as a community in ways that simply wouldnt be possible without the internet or this site.  <br>
<br>
I loved SWCCG for a long time, it was an amazing game, but the fact is, at the end, there were too many cards to acquire, too many rules, and too few really fresh ideas.  When you couple those things with a company that for a long while basically refused to support its game, had semi-professionals employed in its company, and numerous ridiculous garbage (o were giving out trophies, wait its only binders with little foil cards)... LoTR is an amazing movie.  The card game capitalized on it..  The game itself actually derives most of its insipration from magic and netrunner, and lacks the subtle strategy elements and dual sidedness of gameplay in magic.  The fact that WoTC / Hasbro supports magic in a way that dwarfs anything decipher has ever done for LoTR and ever did for SWCCG is beyond question, and aside from the point of neal and dave.  <br>
<br>
Magic is much more competitive and i think if anything, you guys who bash magic will learn from dealing with magic players, that the game isnt as bad as you now think it is, and that WoTC, if anything, is a far superior supporter of its flagship game (other industry practices notwithstanding).  <br>
<br>
The best CCGs ive ever played in order ? 1.SWCCG 2.mtg 3.Legend of the 5 rings 4.Vampire (hehe) 5.Netrunner 6.Lord of the rings... <br>
<br>
at least give magic players a chance to prove you wrong.. and hello to anyone on here i know, its been a while :P<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>Ryan is Legend of the 5 that good?  hmmm, we've had a couple requests for that...  I have a lot of respect for your opinion<hr>Matthew Ley said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>L5R (Legend of the 5 Rings) is a great game, with a better background than any current game not based on a set of movies.  Hell, actually better than some based on sets of movies.<br>
<br>
I would love to see it here on DT.  The only problem I have is how many games can the powers that be here reasonbly support?  It is cool to me that Neal and others occasionally post to Magi-Nation - obviously not the most popular game in the world.  <br>
<br>
Again, the fortunes would smile on us all if L5R was brought in - maybe that would straigten out the karma between Decipher and WoTC :)<hr>Matthew Ley said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>L5R (Legend of the 5 Rings) is a great game, with a better background than any current game not based on a set of movies.

<br>
with that said, and with decktech expanding at a rapid rate, i'd like to cast my ballot for a buffy ccg area on decktech. that game kicks ass too.<hr>Ryan Fojtik said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>yeah L5R played like a combination of the best parts of magic with the best parts of Lord of the rings... <br>
<br>
basically u started with a civilization which gave u stats and automatic "gold"(mana) and a number of provinces (which was represented with a draw pile of effects and characters) and you would attack their provinces, and if u could kill all the defenders and still have a rating over its defense, u would kill it, thus limiting their card drawing and stuff.. honestly i probably would have liked it better than magic if id played it more than i did (only rarely)... one of the reasons it was so cool was it had multiple ways of winning and stuff without getting ridiculous (you could win by accumulating "honor" which u got from meeting some conditions or defeating opponents.. and ud need at least certain amounts of honor to play various personalities and stuff.. it was very very cool.. dunno how big the player base is anymore, its been a while since ive surveyed the ccg market, although i seem to get interested in this stuff every summer hehe.. <br>
<br>
anyway in terms of balance and complexity, its only superior would be starwars (and the original vampire card game, but hardly anyone played that hehe.. it was one of the first games to have political effects and stuff, and used counters on characters for hit points, that u would remove in order to use abilities (remind anyone of Lotr?).. <br>
<br>
anyway ive played LoTR a bunch with some friends who are fairly competent and its allright and plays a bit like magic, but seemed to lack the depth of gameplay that starwars, magic, and the other great ccgs have had...<hr>Andrew Lyle said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>Alright, I'm not one of those 29 year old card players that knows everything about all the card games.. I'm a middleschooler with very little knowledge of the gaming world. But I have to admit I have always hated Magic, i played it for about 5 days. I hated it... Some people have said that the Magic players are some of the best in the world? Take a look at some of these people! They spend their whole life trying to be the World Champion of this card game? Who cares? Don't they have kids, family, or jobs to attend to? I went to Portland once and checked out the card playing scene, I saw Magic players.. All of them were gothic wannabes with black eye shadow, lipstick, and spiked dog chains.<br>
<br>
    And please do not think that Magic players are the only people like this, there are very many LOTR, STCCG (trekkies), and SWCCG players like this as well. I just notice Magic players as the majority. So please, lets not fight over some stupid card game and why it's on a website... Let's just grow up.<br>

<hr>Tim Guzman said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>So what is wrong with 29 year old card players? :)<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>wow - Fojtik good to see that name again.<br><br>you may have you reasons for not liking WOTC but they are 10 times the company Decipher will ever be and MTG will always be the number 1 game (to be honest i just don't believe those reports - call me what you want to). the reasons it will be number 1 are many but let me point out my top 3.<br><br>1)They will never produce a game and market it to dillute their MTG players. Even the new SWTCG is being marketed to MTG players as something they may enjoy between MTG games...compare that to Decipher splitting everyone into multiple games.<br><br>2) Sealed Draft/Drafting leads to a continued support of buying packs from stores which means store owners will keep supporting their players. Add on to that the fact that Limited MTG is so damn fun, you have a good combination. Compare that to the shyte Decipher puts out for sealed/draft...nuff said.<br><br>3) You may not like the tournament structure of MTG - but is allows you to at least join in at a reasonable cost. I just started playing MTG and I can't wait for Invasion to roll out so i can be totally up to date with cards (minus 7th edition stuff) this isn't a bad thing it was perhaps the best decision in the CCG tournament scene ever. Without it the game would have suffered horribly.<br><br>sidenote: if some moron comes on here talking about banning cards can neal auto-ban them. In the last two years decipher has had to bullet/ban more cards than WOTC MTG(yes i know they don't "ban" but the errata to useless). how do i know this? well WOTC's MTG list is ZERO..what is decipher's?<br><br>Evan Fitzgerald<hr>Ryan Fojtik said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>i have no problem with wotc, i actually have a lot of respect for the support they give their games...  also i agree, rochester booster draft = amazing format to play in.<br>
<br>
good to see you guys too.. wierd that i start playing every summer and quit every winter after all the cons hehe..<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>There are little experiences more unenjoyable than Decipher sealed deck of anything.<br>
<br>
Evan, you brought up two excellent things.<br>
<br>
One - Decipher screws up way more cards than WOTC.  And in one prominent case, let the screw up through INTENTIONALLY.  Only Decipher.<br>
<br>
In the interest of fairness, do any of you actually believe Lord of the Rings outsells Magic?  Give me a break.  Lord of the Rings is cool and all, but come on, I hate people who try to delude themselves.  It's an irrtating trait of humans.<hr>Nathan Friedman said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>The only reason Lord of the Rings outsold(Jan and Feb IIRC) Magic was because of timing.  The explosion of the movie and the lack of interest in the current block pushed LotR on top, but don't expect that to ever happen again.  Yes, come January, LotR will get another boost from the next movie, but it won't be this big again.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I doubt LotR has outsold Magic since the release of the awful MOM.  I loved how everyone tried new decks for a few weeks, but back at the TOCs it was all the same old junk before MOM.  ARV is a problem card Decipher is gonna be stuck with for a long time.<br>
<br>
Once again, I've rambled too long...<hr>Al Schaefer said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>wow,<br>
<br>
it seems everybody has an opinion on magic being added to dt.  good, bad, i dont care, bitch bitch bitch.  i'm personally blind to the whole world of magic.  it was the first ccg i ever played, but i ended up having a bad experience with it and it cost me some of my best friends.  ever since then i just ignored the game as much as possible.  then i took up sw, and i've had nothing but an enjoyable time playing and interacting with the other players in my area and in my region.  <br>
<br>
the way i look at it is, dt is a web community for ccg's.  neal's in control and he can do what he wants with it.  as long as sw is here, i'll be here.  if magic is here too, that's great for the ppl who like magic.  i hope they enjoy the dt community and everything we have to offer.  <br>
<br>
because of dt, my game and my enjoyment of the game has improved immensely.  so neal, it's your site do whatever you want.  just dont forget about sw ;-)<hr>will gilchrist said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>Why can't we have more people like Al here?  Look, I've never really played MTG before, despite efforts from a few friends.  It really just never appealed to me.  The whole concept seems uninteresting, and on top of that, there are just too many cards in the game to collect for me to even think about giving it a spin.  That is however, just MY view of the game.  I know that there are people out there who swear by MTG and believe it is the next best thing to sex.  Again, I am not one of those people.  However, why should we (the non-MTG community) not want to incorporate the MTG community into our own to create a more diversified<hr>will gilchrist said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>...(umm, plz ignore break in posts hehe) experience?  As long as Neal and David don't radically change the way things are because of WOTC's and MTG's official involvement, why should the addition of the most popular CCG (let's face it fellow SW/LOTR fans, MTG is the top seller) be negative?  Maybe we can break down previous barriers between WOTC and Decipher fans for a unified gaming community.<hr>Mike Kessling said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>I personally am happy that MTG is coming to DT and I don't even play the game. The reasons that MTG is the greatest card game are:<br>1. The story-line isn't boxed in by movies or books such as SW and LOTR<br>2. The sealed and draft formats are fun and popular.<br>3. The Pro Tour. The money tournaments at Origins and ComiCon are good idea, but Decipher will never be able to have a full blown pro-tour because they will not get sponsorship.<br><br>I also do not believe that LOTR is out selling Magic. I know the majority of players in my area rarely buy packs and trade Magic or Star Wars for the cards they need or just buy singles. Anyways, end rant...MTG coming to DT is a good thing. If it bothers you, don't enter that part of the site.<hr>Adam Beauchamp said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>Bringing Magic to Decktech is a great idea. There are really very few Magic sites left on the net, and Decktechs is sure to be better than the ones that are still out there. <hr>Olivier De Ridder said on Sat Jun 15 2002 <br>I must admit : MAGIC SUCKS :)<br>
It hate that a game that is so comercial comes to a great place like Decktech.Garfield is a Monney Woolf and will do anything to get monney.<br>
<hr>Cortney Haggerty said on Sun Jun 16 2002 <br>duh, weve had this type of discussion before, when the new SW came on. has it caused DT to suck? nope. no reason to expect MTG to cause it to.<br>
<br>
the sky is not falling, people. just chill out.<hr>Vince Sosa said on Tue Jun 18 2002 <br>Hey I don't play  Magic anymore but the exposure to other games and the people that play them might help some of the smaller games on this site.<br>
<br>
the more player the better!!<hr>Tim =STUD= Jones said on Tue Jun 18 2002 <br>ALRIGHT!<br>
   I am not to fond of magic as far as a game, but let me explain this move in terms of business.<br>
<br>
I own a sign business and if some dude comes in and orders 5 signs and i could make 80 bucks off of him but another dude comes in and orders 1000 signs and i can make 4 grand off of him but i lose the customer who ordered only 5 signs which is better for me?<br>
<br>
Sure it would be easier to just do the measely 5 signs, but wouldn't it be better for me to make a few grand to make the company bigger and more respectable?  It isn't that i am greedy, just smart.  Sure i will have ppl telling me "you just did it for the money" and "you are a total sell-out", but guess what?  I DON'T CARE what idiots say to me.  if they are to stupid to realize the smarter business move then so be it.  <br>
<br>
to all of those who keep bashing neal and telling him he is a sell-out, i want you to do this for me, the next time your boss offers you a raise just don't accept it since then you would be a sellout for working hard and making a better person out of yourself...just stay poor and worthless.  business is business and remember that in free capitalistic countries like the one i live in, if you don't like something you have 3 options 1. don't deal with it anymore.  2. accept it and move on. 3.go make your own and make money off it and deal with all the ppl like yourself crying over the fact that you are making money off it.<br>
<br>
-if i wanted any crap out of you i would have given you an ex-lax brownie and told you it was chocalate.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jun 18 2002 <br>Thanks Tim<br>
<br>
Really though, it's not like we're kicking any other games out(yet)!  Just adding one in.  It won't be the last, we'll probably do more even.<hr>Blake Edmondson said on Wed Jun 19 2002 <br>I was just responding to the person who says most Magic players are just goth wannabes trying to win money.  Take a look at the top rated players in the world.  All of them dress decently and are intelligent people.  There are a few goths running around, but if they are on the Pro Tour, who cares.  They are there for their ability to play Magic.  By the way, check up on the money list for those top players.  Many of them have made several thousand dollars and not even been winning many large tourneys.  The winningest players have won over $100,000 playing Magic.  Stop rant here.  Wait, one more thing.  Decipher cannot and will not put the money into tourneys like WOTC ($2,000,000 annually into the Pro Tour and other events).  Even the big SW or LOTR tourneys are DECKTECK Players Challenges, not DECIPHER Players Challenges.  Magic just brings another aspect to the greatest gaming site on the net.<hr>Scott Poster said on Sun Jun 23 2002 <br>Ok all, this is my opinion (as if most of you care)<br>
I see the success Decktech has had running tournaments on there own, and only feel that this will be a sign of good things to come.  I see a future where DPC's are as competitive as Magic's Grand Prix tournaments, and all players benifit from it.  It will expose more players to Decktech, which will give us all more input, which is why I use this site.  So think about what you write for a second, and then complain if you have a valid point.
