DPC Dan III Journey to FreedomCon<br>
<br>
I will now begin to recount the experiences I had at this years 1st annual Freedcom, site of the<br>
2001 Star Wars ccg players, World Championships, Along w/ Star Trek, Jedi Knights and Young<br>
Jedi also respectivly. And every great story needs a theme... an angle, something that will capture<br>
the imagination in everyone, well obvisously I&#146;m not a writer, so something cheesy will have to<br>
do instead. And my gimmick will be a parallel of that great west coast city...HOLLYWOOD. yeah,<br>
Think about it, this is our mecca. The Place Where we&#146;re the stars of our own Movies( Decks,<br>
Tourney&#146;s etc...) Now I know your about to hit the Back Button on your browser, But Hold on.<br>
Just follow me for awhile, you will enjoy the parodies that will mirror the goings ons of <br>
Tinseltown. Freedcom was our Cannes, Sundance, Showest, the great get together as we show<br>
off that what we have developed and financed ( Cards purchased, and traded for.) You will read<br>
of NameDropping ( that shameless practice of metioning notable persons, in order to make one-<br>
self sound important.), PowerLunches ( you know, your people call my people.) and even <br>
Tabloid style reporting, Oh yeah... I&#146;ve got some dirt! you&#146;re all going down. so hop on the <br>
Hollywood Bus and strap yourself in... cause this time its for REAL!<br>
<br>
This TR is Rated PG - 13 Some Material inapropriate for pesons under the age of 13, <br>
Parental guidance is recommended.<br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW name dropping will be in CAPS.<br>
<br>
It&#146;s Tuesday afternoon, I&#146;ve just got off work. I pack up my stuff, grab all the cards I think i&#146;ll need<br>
over the week I will be at Virginia Beach. Give My Buddy JASON KILBY (3 Time worlds qualifier<br>
Baby!)  a call, to come pick me up. We head over to his house, talk a little about cards. His <br>
Girlfriend Chelsea wants to watch real world on mtv. well I don&#146;t watch the show, but it&#146;s on and<br>
Man!, these people need help. I hadn&#146;t seen that many ho&#146;s since the GodFathers...HO TRAIN...<br>
anyhoo after that KILBY puts on American Pie, cause I haven&#146;t seen it before. Eh, It&#146;s okay no<br>
big deal. so then it&#146;s late and we leave at like 8 in the morning so we try and catch some sleep.<br>
<br>
Well The Plane Trip over is uneventful and pretty smooth. we change planes over in Detroit.<br>
and meet up with CHARLES HICKEY and JOE OLSON ( cohorts in the now triple eratted watch<br>
our lock deck.). they&#146;ll be on the plane w/ us. I pick up an EW magazine in the airport, It has an<br>
article on the new Lord of the Rings movie coming this month, Dec. 19. only in theaters. But the<br>
real gold of that issue was the HBO Britney Spears promo page, she was dressed is some Elvis<br>
style jump suit, with her pierced naval exposed ( wow....................................................).<br>
Her music special was going to be on sunday night. But I knew I wouldn&#146;t be able to see cause<br>
1. I don&#146;t think i&#146;ll have HBO. and 2. I&#146;ll probably be playing cards or something.<br>
<br>
We Arrive at Norfolk sometime around 9 o&#146;clock. get our luggage hook up with Trekkie Player,<br>
Don&#146;t remember his name ( I believe he took 3rd at freedomcom for STccg) and we all catch a cab.<br>
And started wondering if all 5 of us would fit into a cab. well this cab pulled up, the Driver had<br>
to be close to 400 Pounds. and fit all of us and our luggage in that car. But Believe you me, it<br>
was a Dang tight fit. altoghether we had about 1750 pounds in that car..., that&#146;s almost a TON!<br>
and we only bottomed out once!<br>
<br>
Arrival of the hotel, it&#146;s nice. We Check in. I meet DAVID ADKERS ( The Steven Spielberg of<br>
Decktech) I&#146;ve never met him before and he seems like a really nice guy. and of course he<br>
Congratulates me on my award winning motion picture : Ramapocon DPC. &quot; Yeah, Baby.&quot;<br>
we head up to which will be come a very crowded room over the next few days. it&#146;s nice and<br>
comfy. JOE OLSON and I play a pick up game that seemed to last for a couple of hours, with him<br>
or me barely winning. I was using a version of QMC against his Ralltiir. I head down to the <br>
gaming halls. And HAYES HUNTER (And with a name like that he could be the next big<br>
action hero superstar!) is playing a pick up game with somebody, and says<br>
high to me and shakes my hand. &quot;you&#146;re last picture was brilliant.&quot; So then shortly afterthat<br>
I head back to get some shuteye.<br>
<br>
Thursday / Interior hotelroom / Morning		FADE IN:<br>
I am slowly awakeing to the sound of a camera shuttering and the giggles to a familiar<br>
person. KILBY is taking pictures of everyone in the room, as he has somehow gotten<br>
a debutant of the lowest common denominator of hollywood starlet to <br>
drape herself across each one of us to find us in a compromising situations, with our<br>
pictures be recorded certainly for scandalous reasons of a coming day. she is very<br>
scantaly dressed in nothing more than her underwear. So After KILBY has his laughs<br>
we are then formally introduced to Tina. she seemed kind of nice. Didn&#146;t say a whole<br>
lot though. Tina didn&#146;t have any clothes so I lent her some shorts and my millenium<br>
falcon swccg T-shirt that I won in a Sealed deck tourney which seems forever ago.<br>
Didn&#146;t really ever find out why she had no clothes with her to begin with, or where<br>
she was from...?<br>
<br>
So Thursday for me was the YJ Qualifier. and I had my decks put together and<br>
ready to go. they were both dueling decks, and monsters at that. But only a few<br>
Showed for this qualifier so it was decided that we will all move on to the final<br>
day for friday! Woo-Hoo! that was easy. Next was The Posh-Posh Party going<br>
on In HAYES HUNTER&#146;S and BASTIAN WINKELHAUS&#146;S room. ( I swear, <br>
Bastian is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of swccg! he&#146;s got all the one-liners too.<br>
Just ask GEMME.) So I decide to introduce Tina to the boys at the party, Man<br>
they all got a kick out of her. But BARONI and BERTA, the little perverts that<br>
they are kept trying to get a peek in her pants! BARONI went even as far to <br>
ask her to show him her holes?..?. Dude, talk about no class. So after tiring of <br>
making small movements in the most crowded room I have ever been in, Tina<br>
and I leave. I go back to my room to tweak some sw&#146;s decks when I get word<br>
from OLSON, &quot; Baroni just barfed up there.&quot; Me, &quot;Some people just have to<br>
know when to say when.&quot;. A little while later Word comes down again. &quot;Yeah<br>
HAYES HUNTER just puked all over the place in his room.&quot; ewww..................<br>
Well what&#146;s to say, except that, I don&#146;t know of any action hero superstars <br>
that can&#146;t hold their liquor? Sorry HAYES I guess you&#146;re just another wannabe.<br>
So I ask OLSON is ALAN SAGAN (eh?, ahem... eh?..., EH!) in his room? <br>
OLSON tells me there is just some random players up there. So I wait awhile and<br>
then head up to see if SAGAN was back, nope. so I ask one of the random guys<br>
for a game. <br>
<br>
Pick up game #? I lost count yesterday. my Junk of a DS LS Combat deck vs.<br>
Random Guy&#146;s, Friends LS LS combat deck. well I wasn&#146;t sure if this was the<br>
deck I wanted to use for sat. cause it&#146;s been getting beat up by everything.<br>
and the same is just about to happen again. oh by the way random guy is<br>
MIKE MERLETTO, and this guys name is catching on hotter that Keanu<br>
Reeves&#146;s 1st action film... Speed. Pretty much he does what that deck does<br>
which is draw sick destiny the whole game, while I track a couple of 7&#146;s and<br>
try to duel off as many jedi as possible, but in the end , I eventually lose the<br>
track and he wins by a dozen or so. we talk a little bit. and for someone, I <br>
thought was fairly green, he didn&#146;t make any mistakes that game, that I could<br>
see.<br>
<br>
Friday YJ day two. and I won&#146;t really go into what happened here, I think to<br>
many of you just don&#146;t give a rats rear end about YJ. so I won&#146;t bore you with<br>
the details. YJ is alot like the classic B - Movie, Great to us that know it, but to<br>
the mass public complete trash. (e.g. Evil Dead II) anyhoo for the sake of tooting<br>
my own horn, I got 5th. yep... not too shabby. I am very proud of myself. thanks<br>
for asking. HEY! Where I come from 16 players is alot!<br>
<br>
HICKEY asked to use my Watto deck for day 2 qualifier for swccg. so I say sure<br>
no prob. cause I was curious to see what it could do... well he went 2wins and<br>
1 loss, with it. one game he won by 44! ouch. that&#146;ll leave a mark. but then one game<br>
it got crushed by some beatdown. I was thinking of adding a ghkk........................<br>
well Between Friday night and Sat. morning is all kind of a blur. I didn&#146;t know<br>
what I wanted to play. and it was pretty much me and DAVID IRVINE, JOE<br>
OLSON, and Keith Watabayashi (Sorry man, you&#146;re not getting capped. I mean<br>
you&#146;re a great guy and all. but your new blood. like Hayden Christensen, you<br>
could be good but then it could be all hype. so you&#146;ll have to pay for your own<br>
limo. the studio is not ready to back you yet.) looking at cards and messing with<br>
decks. and after being verbally abused for concepting an arcona QMC by JOE and <br>
Keith. I went and pestered SCOTT LINGRELL to borrow a card. and I ended <br>
up with Throne room Mains for LS. and I will Play the Watto deck, I let HICKEY use.<br>
<br>
Saturday worlds day 2 qualifier.<br>
After I turned in deck list, I went for some breakfast.<br>
ahh breakfast down at the Pocahontas cafe! The place mat even<br>
had the tragic story of the indian princess. I don&#146;t know about you<br>
but when I eat french toast, I don&#146;t wan&#146;t to read about a woman<br>
dying of disease leaving 2 children alone with a widowed father...<br>
But hey! that&#146;s just me. as i&#146;m leaving the hostess hands me a freedomcon<br>
dogtag that was left behing by one of the players. so when I head back to<br>
the gaming hall I ask MATT BERTA if he knows whom it may belong, MATT<br>
was in the restaurant too, with GUZMAN,&amp; HUNTER, so he doesn&#146;t know, and<br>
the name is completely smugded off the back so it&#146;s nobodys now, and I decide<br>
right then and there it keep it. So I have an extra FreedomCom Dogtag!<br>
Hmm... Maybe I can autograph it and put it up for the Deckteck autograph of the<br>
month! jeez, I wonder... How many Decktech points would people put on it?<br>
2 maybe?, I should get at least a dozen, wait why sell myself short... a bakers<br>
dozen! yeah, pure gold.<br>
<br>
so back to the whole point at hand day two. pairings are announced.<br>
Well after most of the pairings were called off, SCOTT LINGRELL signals to me<br>
as I am his first opponent. Man my name was once again butchered by the<br>
Assisting Directors. So I sit down next to BRIAN HUNTER ( The Charleton <br>
Heston of swccg... I mean think about it, they&#146;re both known for being religious<br>
figures? and, and, People talk all kinds of garbage about them, but when they see<br>
them in person, it&#146;s all mister Hunter this, and Chuck that. Hmm... I wonder if <br>
Brian Hunters a Jr. President of the NRA?.) Well SCOTT and I are talking as we<br>
start the game, about being nervous and stuff, I&#146;m like not really Maybe when the<br>
my 1st movie was released but not now... not after my couple of Blockbuster Films<br>
took the world by storm. So then  SCOTT asks the kid playing HUNTER if he&#146;s <br>
nervous and it&#146;s that random kid MERLETTO! ( now thats an action hero<br>
superstar name if I ever heard one.) this kid&#146;s gonna be huge! anyhoo, MERLETTO<br>
in his best Eastwood impression, I Dont give a Shiznitt. Man talk about a pair of <br>
grapefruits. and then he goes ahead and takes down the man. who walks on water!<br>
&quot;Down goes Frasier!, Down goes Frasier!&quot; its ok, that MERLETTO guy got trashed<br>
by Foreman all weekend( that Honking fool TIM GUZMAN.).<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Watto vs Scott Lingrell&#146;s RST (2035)<br>
I flip early, make him lose some force<br>
he sets up his cards to take out the bunker. He<br>
searches for something not there I verify , no ooc/tt or <br>
reg. the game gets tight, I don&#146;t have enough people to<br>
keep the bunker, so I go for Tat. Occ. set up, I play<br>
neimodian advisor to get tat system, all other cards<br>
to set up are in my hand, and the card is not there!<br>
I was activating like 11, 8 cards in reserve turn before<br>
I played some stuff recycled the cards in my forcepile<br>
and the few cards from activation overflow was the<br>
system. next turn he blows the bunker, I lose my<br>
hand, 8 force, take a couple of beatdowns and the game<br>
is over! FL -29 , 0/ -29<br>
<br>
Highs - Playing Scott. I wish we could play more often.<br>
Lows - Tough Deck Flow, Just couldn&#146;t get the cards<br>
I needed. to compete in the middle of the game.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
Throne Room vs Justin Beal AOBS (1777)<br>
I get kind of a slow start, he has his stuff going.<br>
and Can&#146;t draw luke for the life of me. but I have<br>
Colo Claw on table and Plo Kloon at JCouncel.<br>
so you would think hacking at xizor would be<br>
easy huh? nope. swing and draw a 2 and a 1,<br>
and there was already a 1 on colo from earlier, and<br>
I swap w/ plo, and draw another 1, the sucide mission<br>
with epp qui-gon fails. lots of battling and damage <br>
but in the end he pulls out the victory somewhere in<br>
the high teens. FL -18? , 0/ -48<br>
<br>
Highs - The deck in alot of ways did what it was sup-<br>
posed to do except excute in its destiney draws. even<br>
with the support of colo and plo, it wasn&#146;t enough and<br>
with the lack of proper testing, I couldn&#146;t establish <br>
weaknesses yet.<br>
Lows - Someplayers bother me, not them parsay but<br>
their attitude towards the game. Hey I have battleplan<br>
on the table but he&#146;s gonna drain me everyturn like it&#146;s<br>
not there, unless I say something. which I did, remind<br>
him everyturn to pay 3 force. whatever.<br>
<br>
well they start anouncing parings from the top to the<br>
bottom. and when it gets down to the last few, STEVEN<br>
TURNER comments that this is humilating to do it this<br>
way. well I being one of the final two. that they don&#146;t even<br>
bother to call my name nor my opponent. They just say<br>
well you two are last, get in there. I have to ask what side I&#146;m<br>
Playing. my opponent is the newest member of our already<br>
crowded hotel suite. LAUTARO LEIVA<br>
He won the Spain providence. and a Super Dude... Dude...<br>
Dude...<br>
<br>
Game 3.<br>
Throne Room vs Lautaro Leiva HD w/Podracing. (1766)<br>
Well, He forgot to put in No Escape into his deck,<br>
and Honor was kicking the snot out of him. his podrace<br>
did do some damage to me, but in the end with his own<br>
visage killing him, I win. FW + 21 , 2/ -17<br>
<br>
Highs - Getting a win. and a very fun game lots of <br>
banter back and forth.<br>
Lows - none for me, but Him forgetting no escape<br>
was brutal, it killed him all day.<br>
<br>
Game 4.<br>
Watto vs Greg Shaw WYS (1791)<br>
Well I Built the Watto Deck specifically to take out<br>
WYS, so I was feeling pretty good going into this<br>
game. and it was a tough time for greg. as I got all<br>
my stuff into play w/ occupation in full effect. and<br>
I  think he only flipped his objective once before<br>
it flipped back for good. FW +22 , 4 / + 05<br>
<br>
Highs - Playing WYS and getting some revenge on<br>
Greg from Ramapo Open.<br>
Lows - None, it was a good matchup for me.<br>
<br>
So after game 4, I catch up with SCOTT LINGRELL<br>
and we go across the street to get something to eat.<br>
SCOTT&#146;s a good guy and not someone I would&#146;ve <br>
normally got to meet if it wasn&#146;t for swccg.<br>
<br>
Game 5.<br>
Throne Room vs Andy McClure MKOS (2044)<br>
well he starts Colo, which means I can&#146;t start<br>
mine, which sucks, cause I&#146;m not using the<br>
other 2 effects to get mine back in play. I threw<br>
it in last minute as secret Lingrell tech, and didn&#146;t<br>
expect anyone else to play it, but DS&#146;s advantage<br>
is to play effects first. so he drops galid and mosep<br>
to audience chamber. and then next turn I drop<br>
padme and epp qui-gon to wreck the place and cause<br>
like 6 overflow or something. he drops u-3po. and<br>
then he starts the epp double swinging maul show.<br>
and this maul is just a beast! I kill one but another comes<br>
down. and in the end he just did a better job of battling<br>
than I did. FL -24 , 4 -19<br>
<br>
Highs - that beatdown on mosep and galid was sweet.<br>
especially cause, none shall pass was useless.<br>
Lows - colo claw fish. Now I did play throne room as<br>
starting site, and what I didn&#146;t think about until after the<br>
game was,... does that mean I also play my effects 1st?<br>
I dunno, somebody help me out, Im curious. also epp.<br>
maul. dude, the cards a beast. and very difficult to get a<br>
hold of. I would have built my decks differently had I had<br>
some, to tech around.<br>
<br>
well now i&#146;m 2 wins and 3 losses. and any hope of top 8 is<br>
out the window, so I decide to play another game with<br>
my watto deck, cause I like it alot. <br>
<br>
Game 6.<br>
Watto vs Alan Sagan LS,LS Combat (1936)<br>
Well again I always get the first turn flip, but after that<br>
for some reason, it seems to go down hill. he sets up<br>
his drains, podracing. and then when I have my tragedy,<br>
Aim high, and podracing( BTW this one sucks. just so you<br>
know, I should&#146;ve looked at it more closley.) shields out he<br>
inserts on me with ntmto arghh, well I have decent destiney<br>
out and at one point he underestimates what I can do with<br>
the deck so I got one good beatdown in with like 12 overflow.<br>
but in the end it&#146;s not enough, I fall to the Canadian. &quot;eh?&quot; yeah<br>
he got me. FL -23? , 4 / -42<br>
<br>
Highs - I got the deck to flip w/ good defense everygame on<br>
first turn. it just lacks something lategame. i&#146;ll have to work on<br>
that.<br>
Lows - One of the more Impressive decks I saw floating around<br>
Freedomcon. Good Job Alan. It was similar to RIPPENTOE&#146;S deck.<br>
that was a good one too.<br>
<br>
After Game 6 I dropped from the Tourney. I went and Got some<br>
Sleep. ahh... precious sleep, why do I deny you so? at some point<br>
between my sleep and fading consisnous I had heard that <br>
AKESSON ( he Borrowed my RF3 Qui-Gon Jinn, So then I did have some<br>
sort of a influence if you will on the final match., at least that&#146;s what<br>
I tell myself as cry to sleep, in the mire of my failures...) And BASTIAN<br>
were in the final confrontation, with the same dark deck, a non - objective<br>
tat. occupation deck. &quot;well I thought, I must be dreaming... non - objective<br>
decks don&#146;t work anymore.&quot; so, I went back to sleep.<br>
<br>
Sunday.<br>
<br>
Well I wake up, Push Tina aside and see that the team tourney&#146;s in 25 min&#146;s<br>
Scramble time! grab a light side senate deck throw three cards in, and take 3 <br>
out. grab the stupid ds ls combat deck throw 10 cards in, and pull 10 cards <br>
out. head down stairs. the medal show is going on, but I miss it as i&#146;m trying<br>
to figure out what exactly my decks do. not a good sign.<br>
<br>
Team tourney, Team name - Team Scrub (and with a name like that, there is<br>
no pressure to do anything.) it&#146;s CHARLES HICKEY, JOE OLSON, ME and<br>
some guy who needed a team. <br>
<br>
Game 1.<br>
LS Senate vs Brian Fred HD (2046)<br>
well, shoot. HD the one deck I didn&#146;t want to play. specifically because<br>
my deck uses farmboy luke in space. and only runs 1 obi w/stick. and<br>
no qui-gon. well I get farmboy and rsq wedge. to coruscant system early<br>
and replace my corscant w/ old school coruscant for the fatty drain.<br>
he put down no escape from opening hand down. I hate it when that<br>
happens. so my honor is worth nothing. my drain in space is nothing<br>
cause I can&#146;t rembember that skywalkers don&#146;t drain on flipped HD.<br>
duh??? so land red 5 after I deployed corran to db exchange pilots<br>
take off, so I have 7 ability and a cancel destiny sitting at coruscant<br>
with a drain of 3. farmboy, running for his life db to db in a non<br>
epic duel HD satisfying menace fades, while he has maul and vader<br>
and their sticks on table. finally he drops mara on luke. and iniates.<br>
well i&#146;m holding portal since early and through verification I see he&#146;s<br>
running 2 or 3 of the retarget interrupt. but it just so happens not to<br>
be in his hand at this time so I flip my destiny of 2?.... 2! arggh, mara<br>
lives chops luke and dark strikes him. no more luke which now means<br>
only I lose to visage. well now he has a DJedi at every DB. and I cant<br>
satisfy menace fades. I have valorum in hand and a naboo DB in my<br>
deck somewhere, so on my turn I go look for it an wala! it&#146;s there so<br>
down goes valorum and menace fades is back in business. his turn he<br>
moves vader in front I put a six on colo to suicide and kill vader and<br>
then move palpy out of senate to cover the coruscant db. but <br>
he slices valorum in the battle and plays another dark strike! 2 in one<br>
deck! and then tells me it&#146;s standard practice. well not in hick Oregon<br>
that&#146;s where our defensive fire goes.<br>
<br>
well I still move palpy, and at somepoint he dies so late game down<br>
comes corran, I draw boussh to cancel visage, and I win by three.<br>
FW +3 , 2 / +3<br>
<br>
Highs - Winning a game I should&#146;ve lost, against a very strong<br>
player. he topped decked the few starfighters he had leaving me<br>
uncontested in space from turn 3.<br>
Lows - Must remember HD on flip side.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS combat, epic duel vs. 1492 ranked random player. WYS<br>
well a bad deck match up to begin with for me. tight game.<br>
I had zuckass n&#146;mist hunter and made two suicide missions to<br>
take out space, and looking through my reserve deck, I had <br>
better than 70 % chance of getting destiny to kill outrider,<br>
but 3 times I failed to pull the right destiny, and I lost space.<br>
the drain of four by maul was huge. at one point he dropped down<br>
luke w/ stick, and my turn I drop vader w/stick, epic duel, vaders<br>
obsession. he crosses luke and loses some force. but in the<br>
end he forgot to land his starfighter to satisfy menace so I drain<br>
out his last 3 cards with maul. FW +2 , 4 / +05<br>
<br>
Highs - I got to epic duel luke off. cool.<br>
Lows - Should&#146;ve lost the game, and my deck sucks.<br>
and, that&#146;s about all I got to say about that.<br>
<br>
Game 3.<br>
LS Senate vs Alan Sagan ISB (1936)<br>
well shoot, I had to play Alan twice at Ramapo, too<br>
and now once again. and though I got a good jump early,<br>
once he got his stuff out, it was all down hill.<br>
FL -15 , 4 / -10<br>
<br>
Highs - It was a pretty fun game. If a couple of things went<br>
my way I could&#146;ve won this one.<br>
Lows - Alan Is making a Strong push for me to be his Bi-atch.<br>
&quot;I will not succumb to your canadian ways!&quot;  &quot;eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Game 4.<br>
DS Combat vs Brian Hunter WYS (2303)<br>
So I finally get to play the Man. And What Do I tell myself, I<br>
wish I had a different deck. yeah, so I just try to make the best<br>
of it. If A 1492 player should of beat this deck. doesn&#146;t than mean<br>
a 2303 player would win by 64? don&#146;t ask me where I came up with<br>
that number, It&#146;s not important. anyhoo he beats me silly. Like by <br>
25, no cards in his lost pile. but... and I mean but... Just like before<br>
He puts down Luke w/stick. and then I drop Vader w/stick, epic<br>
duel, vaders obsession. cross luke, and he loses some cards.<br>
that is before he retrieved it of course. and I know what yer<br>
saying, &quot;where was run Luke, run?&quot; well he and the other<br>
opponent were playing it. I saw it in both there decks through<br>
verification. they just never got it in their hands, at the right<br>
time. so FL -25 , 4 / 35<br>
<br>
Highs - Playing Brian, It was a fun game, Heck I didn&#146;t care.<br>
Lows - Next time, I will be better prepared.<br>
<br>
At the end of the tournament they start giving out some <br>
prizes to random drawings. and my name is called and<br>
what do I win... General Veers swccg T-Shirt. YEAH!<br>
I love these T-shirts. I wish they still gave them out over the<br>
Foils. And I don&#146;t mind being called a T-shirt player thank<br>
you very much T.J. HOLMAN. because that&#146;s what I&#146;m wearing<br>
90% of the time, at tourneys......ok, outside of tourneys too.<br>
but, they&#146;re real comfortable.<br>
<br>
So I&#146;m back in the room, and I&#146;m looking at how horrible of<br>
a deck the ds combat is, when I notice... Luke w/Stick.<br>
I&#146;ve got BRIAN HUNTER&#146;S Luke! cool..., I could autograph<br>
this as a hijacked Luke w/stick, and put up on decktech for<br>
auction. Wait! I wonder if people would bid on this on ebay?<br>
I could do a 2 for 1 with the Dog Tag! could be bank? uh-huh?<br>
<br>
So anyway I&#146;m watching the ram, pats game. It goes to comm-<br>
recial and I flip the channel and what do I see, oh my gosh...<br>
Britney Spears. The Room Gets HBO. 1st the Veers T-shirt,<br>
now Britney...the Trip is paid for. I&#146;m entranced for awhile,<br>
until an unwanted close up of a couple of queer dancers <br>
breaks up the brain-washing. so I go down to the Bar to see<br>
HICKEY play Lord of the Rings. And BRIAN HUNTER is<br>
Down there so I let him know  that I kidnapped his Luke<br>
W/stick. He says that&#146;s only his second one and that he needs<br>
it back, Like I was going to keep it or something? I was just<br>
gonna sell it on ebay for major bank! 2 for 1 baby!<br>
<br>
we head back to the room, and I go to grab the card, and<br>
I see BRIAN take a look at Tina... Well he gives me this<br>
look like, I don&#146;t even want to know what you guys are into.<br>
well all that seemed to get lost because it was the HBO<br>
Finale of Britney&#146;s concert, and she was getting WET.<br>
I dunno what was the whole deal, but I wasn&#146;t complaining.<br>
I think all the guys in the room was mesmerized by the little<br>
pop diva, I don&#146;t remember Tina saying much during that<br>
sequence either.<br>
<br>
Well that was pretty much the end of the day, I tried to <br>
get some sleep later on while Beavis(Harpster) and <br>
Butthead(N.Jones) made clowns out of themselves.<br>
-Drinking Tip #1- After vomiting, don&#146;t continue to<br>
drink, it&#146;s not a good thing.<br>
-Proper ettiquette Tip #1- if your gonna get into<br>
a card throwing duel with someone... Don&#146;t grab<br>
their Rares and throw those. They don&#146;t like that.<br>
<br>
A little while the last of the seattle crew left the<br>
room, and we got some shut eye. we awoke in the<br>
morning payed our bill. ate some breakfast and went<br>
home. and that&#146;s the end of that. Toodles.<br>
<br>
Props<br>
<br>

<br>
Me for not using one Swear word this whole<br>
Tourney report. I thought this should&#146;ve been<br>
rated PG. But the MPAA has it out for me man.<br>
where&#146;s the justice?<br>
<br>
again myself for not blaming or accusing sleep<br>
deprivation for anything. you know, you finally<br>
will have to accept the fact that no swccg player<br>
gets sleep at major tourneys. good or bad, it&#146;s just<br>
a fact, none of us has the sleep we want before<br>
we play.<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
<br>
My performance, I scrubbed.<br>
I didn&#146;t prepare very well, at all.<br>
next time.<br>
<br>
Honking, Barfing, Puking, Chucking,<br>
tossing the cookies, losing my lunch,<br>
lurch, throw up, heave, hurl, etc...<br>
way too much of that was going on.<br>
<br>
airport bars for charging 2.50 for a<br>
12 oz soda. and 5.00 for a bottle of<br>
heinekan.<br>
<br>
Tina. She borrowed my clothes and <br>
never said thank you, or anything.<br>
totally dissed me the whole weekend.<br>
Rude, somepeople.<br>
