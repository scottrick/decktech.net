It was a tournament I knew I was not going to win. I was playing some fun decks and knew that I would not win many games. Chris “Vader 69” Seymour called round for me at about 10:30; my head still throbbing from the night before (don’t ask!) and my head was not in a fit state for a tournament (another poor excuse). I arrived at our hall at about 10:45 with still quarter of an hour to go I started to make changes to my treasured decks. I put in “Get To Your Ships” as well as “Squadron Assignments” as this meant that I could pull out two ships a go! Our tournament director was also giving out rares for every time a player won a game, completed an epic event or flipped their objective (once for combat), which was a nice early Christmas pressie! Here is now a list of the players, some detail, their decks and their chances of winning in my opinion<br>
<br>
Elliott “Dengar 69” Weights (me): I consider myself to be a half decent player who can beat the players slightly better than me just not any higher than that. I normally come around 2nd to 4th and have never won a tournament although I have won a draw prize, a nice foil Twillek. I was playing a dark side combat called Watch Where You’re Swinging That Thang / You Could Have Someone’s Eye Out With That packed with high destiny which is also on deck tech check it out on my page and a new light side from theed called We Have A Plan, which will not be on deck tech as it is just awful! Chances of winning 7/10.<br>
<br>
Chris “ Vader 69” Seymour: Chris is a very intelligent and very clever player! Builds ingenious decks that no one can beat or even inflict any damage on. Probably the best player at the tournament! Chris was playing two decks with no objective; his dark was a Tatooine draining deck, which is also on deck tech called Maul Chillin At The Pimps House. His light side was another old deck called Throne Room Holograms with a few changes; check out his old one on deck tech too. Chances of winning: 9/10<br>
<br>
Jordan “Rogue 2” Thomas:  Jordan has lots of nice cards and can build some fantastic decks with them, just maybe hasn’t got the luck of the draw when it comes to the computer choosing your opponent or the cutting edge to win. Comes anywhere between 2nd to 6th, never won a tournament. Builds solid decks! Jordan was playing the two new theed ones which were untested. Chances of winning: 7/10<br>
<br>
Matt (tournament director) Hardy: Now I have to be nice here as he did give out a lot of rares, so here goes. Matt doesn’t seem to get that many games as being a tournament director he only plays when needed and if he does he normally plays the same decks. Never the less Matt is a goods player as he has far more experience in playing than most of us. Today Matt was playing a new Invasion deck with more battle droids than they actually had in the film! His light side deck was his normal Hyperdrive, very powerful but he has overplayed it! We have also tried to persuade him to join deck tech but still hasn’t. Never won a tournament to my knowledge, normally comes about 2nd or 3rd. Chances of winning: 8/10<br>
<br>
William Wood: Scottish! Is a very slow player and has lots of timed out games! Builds good decks but starts badly and always perks up at the end and comes between 1st and 6th. Only ever won one tournament! Buys lots of boxes (2.5 R2) and has lots of cards. Will was playing another Invasion deck and a light side combat. Will is also another one that we have tried to get to join deck tech but is very resilient Chances of winning: 6.5/10<br>
<br>
Jacob Keet: Jacob normally comes about 4th to 7th. . He has the advantage of having a lot of cards spanning all the sets. Has the cards to build good decks and does build good decks just doesn’t seem to do well with them although has come higher than me but it was a type 2 tournament. Builds strong decks! Today Jacob was playing a Ralitir Operations and a We’ll Handle This. Member of Deck Tech but his name is unknown. Chances of winning: 5/10    <br>
<br>
Michael Bentley: Michael only ever seems to play one or two people only outside of a tournament format. Has lots of good cards just not the essentials like objectives. His brother watched the tournament so we may have a new player next time. Today Michael was playing a deck with no objective, starting with the death star and playing with some hard aliens. His light side was a profit using Bo Shudda and someone who loves you.# Normally comes 2nd to last. Chances of winning: 4/10<br>
<br>
Carl “ Jode” Jenner: Carl has the ability I believe as one of the players who come 4th and above but is lacking the cards to do well and loses silly games to silly people! Builds decks using some old cards which are good old cards it’s just that cards have been released to counteract the old strategies. Carl was playing a Court Of The Vile Gangster and a type two deck in an open format, which no one was expecting.   Unfortunately normally comes last. Chances of winning: 3/10.<br>
<br>
I had an average tournament due to my average performance and I was using some fun decks. I ended up losing half and winning half of my games. Here is a rundown of my games if I won and the differential: <br>
               <br>
1st game: First I played Chris Seymour. I was using my Dark Combat versus his Light Deck with no objective. He started with the Massasi throne room to go first. I deployed the perfect combo on the second turn Maul with his Lightsaber and Dr Evazan and Ponda Babba. This was a mistake as my big activation towards him gave him an opportunity for a beatdown. He deployed: Obi with his sabre, Chewie pissed off, Leia With Blaster, and Han With Blaster. He then played Clash Of Sabres to exclude Maul leaving a power 3 Dr Evazan and Ponda Babba. He then played Jedi Presence, Life debt and ended up with about 6 destinies thus creating 60-battle damage at the Theed Palace Generator. I think it was game over! I had lost by 35, as he had to deploy something! I have learnt an important lesson from this-IMPERIAL BARRIER!!<br>
<br>
2nd game: That last loss had put me into last place and I ended up playing the person who would be second to last. This person was Carl. I was playing my new theed objective versus his Court Of The Vile Gangster. I set up some drains at the Naboo while he virtually untouchable at the audience chamber until he moved his characters and I beat down with Qui Gon With Lightsaber and a unique Naboo pilot against Chall Bekan and another alien, this also signalled the end of the game. The win of 14 was not as big as I had hoped for but it could have been less. Carl forgot to make me lose one a turn for not occupying a Tatooine location. <br>
<br>
3rd game: I played my light side theed deck again against Jordan’s invasion deck. This was not a good match up. His battle droids dominated just about every theed location and I could not get to the throne room or get into space. I ended up losing by 24, which was nothing to be proud of.<br>
4th game: After another demoralising defeat it turned out I was playing Jordan again but opposite sides. Jordan was using his light side theed while I was playing my devilish combat. It took him up to seven turns to get to his throne room as I had the extra interior locations. He eventually got there and dominated space while I was combating his Jedi. All in all it was a good game with Jordan winning by 3!<br>
<br>
5th game: I knew at this stage of the tournament that I could not win so I was just out to try and boost my pride by winning my last two games. My 5th game was against Michael’s very strange mains and toys deck versus my light side theed. He had a few turns before I could get to the throne room so he sat his mains down at the throne room making it virtually impossible to flip my objective. I drained at space and even t the death star, as it was his starting location, so three at naboo and three at the death star. I had minimal draining on the ground. I ended up winning by 14. Just to note that our tournament director commented that the gap between the people at the bottom and the people at the top was narrowing and that everyone was getting better.<br>
<br>
6th game: Again I played Michael but Michael was less enthusiastic as I was and he basically threw the game by initiating silly battles. I was using my devilish combat against his profit. As I said he Basically threw the game by initiating silly battles. I ended up winning by 34 putting me in 4th place for the day, which was lucky!<br>
<br>
Here are the placings of the players at our tournament:<br>
<br>
8th: Unfortunately there has to be a last place and it normally seems to go to Carl. Unlucky Carl Better luck next time! Scoring no points puts him in last! Don’t use a Type two deck in an open environment! 0 pts in total.<br>
<br>
7th: Unlucky Michael who won two games against Carl wasn’t enough differential to put him any higher. Try playing with two objectives! 4 pts in total.<br>
<br>
6th: Surprisingly was Jordan! He beat me twice and another close win. Was not enough to climb any more places. 6 pts in total.<br>
<br>
5th: Well done Jacob! Winning three games and coming higher than Jordan is something to be proud of. Coming away with the draw prize was good also. Keep it up. 6 pts in total.<br>
<br>
4th: I came 4th, which was lucky as two other people had 6 points. Today I learnt lessons and shed a tear at a 60-battle damage defeat. One tip for myself is never again playing that awful new theed objective it stinks. 6 points in total.<br>
<br>
3rd: Matt our tournament director who gave out free rares came 3rd. This is good for Matt as he doesn’t normally get to play being a tournament director and I liked his idea with the force servitude combined with droid racks it paid off. Thanks for the free rares! 8 points in total but not enough differential to come any higher. <br>
<br>
2nd: Chris who normally wins has been piped to the post. His decks just weren’t up to their normal standard and we had all seen them before. His next target is to get higher than 60 battle damage, maybe a super falcon life debt! 8 points in total having the differential to come higher than Matt by those big win games. <br>
<br>
1st: Will oh Will. This was certainly a surprise from a man that normally comes 6th to 4th! I think that we have all grown to like the invasion deck and we should see quite a lot in the future. Well done Will 9 points in all and a foil prize.<br>
<br>
So you’ve seen the skills and abilities at our tournaments why not come down if you’re in or around the west Sussex region of Naboo (England). Our next tournament is a sealed deck tournament which none of us have done before. I am hoping for a Dr Evazan, some Storm troopers, blasters and any imperial leader. For more enquires on tournaments in the area contact Bill Gregory at Comics For All Littlehampton or Matt Hardy (Tournament Director) or D- Mail me at “Dengar 69”. Please review this report fairly as it is my first and I have not read any other reports!<br>
