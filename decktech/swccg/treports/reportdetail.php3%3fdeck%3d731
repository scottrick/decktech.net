<br>
I&amp;#8217;ll guess I&amp;#8217;ll be like everybody else and tell you a little about my trip to the GS.  <br>
It started the morning of the GS.   I woke up and got ready to drive out to Bonanza HS where I had to take my SAT.  I had to go straight from there to the tournament.  I get there and go to my seat in the room and somebody I know shows up.  Fucking Kris Lavigne sits right in front of me so I have to call him an ass since he said he was taking his SAT at Cheyenne instead of Bonanza.  Now in between the test I have to call my mom on the cell phone of the guy in charge of the room to let her know that I have a ride and to us go to Vacation Village and drop my stuff off with Chris Hines.  After the SAT John &amp;#8216;The Man&amp;#8217; Spadora and Kris&amp;#8217;s little brother Jeff meet us outside the school.  We start to drive to Vacation Village and stop and Jack In The Box on the way to eat.  We finally get to Vacation Village and it turns out that they screwed up Girard's reservations so we had to stay at the Maxim. . . wait a second. . . that wasn&amp;#8217;t us, we live in Las Vegas.  So I pay my fees and fill out deck lists and wait for the tournament to start 45 minutes late(like anybody thought it would start on time).<br>
<br>
For light I am playing a Tat. M+T deck that starts with HB to pull Dag. for activation and a place to drop Yoda.  It then plays 4 Bens and 3 EPP Lukes while the Super Falcon attempts to clear out the skies.  Also packing 3 Smoke Screens for extra punch and no SAC.<br>
<br>
For Dark I start Tat.  Pull the Palace which pulls the Chamber and everything else is a choke location.  Mains + Toys with decent destiny, 2 Dr. E&amp;#8217;s and lots of weapon interrupts.  Can set-up Occupation if I need to cause damage and has nothing to combat test 5 decks(see my first game).<br>
<br>
We have 52 people including the AZ crew(that&amp;#8217;s where I started to play but was always a scrub there), a lot from Cali., some from Colorado including Kyle Craft who I really wanted to play against, and a few from Utah.  I think that I heard there was even one or two from Michigan but I&amp;#8217;m not sure.  <br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
DS vs. DJ Andrews  Test 5<br>
I pull my stuff and draw.  He must have had a great hand because Luke, Yoda, two sites, test 1 and a lot of helpers come down.  When he searches for a Jedi Test he pulls 3.  Right there I knew I was screwed.  I am afraid to drain because of Counter Assault even though I grabbed the first one he played he always left enough force.  I drop a whole bunch of ships at Tat. And set-up the Occupation which he cancels with Endor Celebration before it can cause any damage.  I was able to drain in space for a massive 1 with out fear the whole game.  He completes the Jedi tests in the minimum amount of turns possible drawing a 7 every time including test 5.  There isn&amp;#8217;t a ground battle the whole game since he just Nabruns around and kills all my Elis&amp;#8217; with QAM.  I lose by 31.<br>
<br>
PROS: He made a mistake when deploying to space and had his destiny reduced to 0 when he would have had a 7.<br>
CONS: He was playing a degenerative deck that I had never played against before.  Only the second time I even remember seeing it a tourney.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
LS vs. Matt Reicks(spelling my be wrong)<br>
His deck pretty much the same thing that I was playing.  He deploys Mara to AC 2nd turn and there is no saber for her.  I drop Ben + Luke on my turn, battle, Mara plus 8 go and Luke bounces back.  I had an answer to everything that he did.  Super Falcon cleared out Fett IN Slave 1 and he couldn&amp;#8217;t do anything on the ground.   I try to play Bith Shuffle but he grabbed which kept my win to 39.<br>
<br>
PROS:  Complete domination.<br>
CONS:  He grabbed my Shuffle keeping the win out of the 40&amp;#8217;s.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
LS vs. Kyle Crafts Rumors<br>
I was actually glad that I got to play him.  I wanted to see how I could stack up to the player with the 2nd highest rating in the world.  Everything goes normal for our 1st turns.  On his second he deploys Elephant Mon and a Dreadnaught to Kasshyyyk.  This really blow because it will be a drain of 4 there next turn and I don&amp;#8217;t have the Super Falcon yet.  On my turn I drop Luke in the Falcon and kill the Dread, I the run to Dagobah and I don&amp;#8217;t draw another pilot.  His turn he drops another ship so I go block the drain again.  He activates 2 and plays Unexpected Interruption to grab a Twi&amp;#8217;Lek, then he activates 3 more and grabs Lat. Damage which I saw coming after he played the Unexpected.  I&amp;#8217;m pretty pissed.  He drops the damage and I have to lose Luke plus a little more.   I can&amp;#8217;t get the Super Falcon in hand so I drop Luke + Ben + Saber to the wastes for a drain of 3 so I can cause damage.  When I finally get Capt. Han and Melas (no Leia to be found) on the Falcon and battle he draws a 6, that&amp;#8217;s game right there.  Lose by 21.<br>
<br>
PROS:  I got to play Kyle.  The kid was Fucking hilarious and a fun person to play as well.  <br>
CONS:  Where the hell were the Super Falcon cards.  I even Tunnel Visioned in a 14-card force pile and couldn&amp;#8217;t find the cards to complete the ship.<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
DS vs. Mike &amp;#8216;The Mizer&amp;#8217; Sinclair&amp;#8217;s TR mains<br>
He has lost his last 2 games by one each to Tim Guzman and Kris Lavigne.  He goes to find a Nudj and there isn&amp;#8217;t one there so I get to peak at his deck.  He is playing mains and adders with the &amp;#8216;despite your bad feelings initiate a battle and triple damage&amp;#8217; card and a light SAC.  Now I know not to spread thin.  I get a good location draw and drop the D* on my turn.  He gets the Falcon with EPP Han and Chewie piloting with the Tantive there as the first invader.  I was saving up to drop the Executor and Fett In S1 to take it out.  Because I&amp;#8217;m waiting I take a few drains of 3.  When I am finally about to deploy my stuff to the D* I realize that I can set up Occupation at two sites with two sabers and won&amp;#8217;t spread myself thin so I do that instead, he was a little surprised at that.  On his turn he comes down with Obi and Luke, Clash(haven&amp;#8217;t found my CTR) and battle.  Pretty much everybody of mine died as did his Luke.  When my character is normal again I drop Dannik, battle, kill Obi and eat some soup , no more Obi.  He is taking like 8 damage a turn from occupation and drains when he drops Luke to the chamber where DR. E and Jade are chilling.  Clash Mara(still no CTR) and battle E.  I lose E and 4, not too bad.  I kill Luke.  He goes to space to try to kill Fett in an effort to cancel occupation but I cancel the battle with Projective Telepathy.  On my turn I draw a tracked 4 to kill the GL and that is pretty much game.  I win by 4.<br>
<br>
PROS:  Good game and a cool person to play.  <br>
CONS:  He lost 3 games in a row by a total of 6, that has got to suck ass.<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs. some guy @#$%ty duel deck<br>
I drop Ben with a Saber to Cantina even though he is dueling.  I have a swing and a miss to cancel his focused attack and my destiny are solid so I play with some balls.  I also can tell that this guy is not good enough to track destiny.  On drops vader with saber and I know he wants to duel.  Than he surprises me and drops the Dark Path, I say Fuck to myself because now he should win.  He uses Dark Path, loses 2 EPP Vaders, duels, I cancel focused attack, he draws a 6 and something else while I draw a 4 and a 1.  I lose Ben  and nine .  On my turn I know I need to kill this Vader or I will lose.  I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find any fives to track yet so I need to Smoke Screen for it.  I drop Luke to accompany Orri, and Tawss.  He plays Unexpected and grabs a Focused Attack.  He wants to play The Force Is Strong&amp;#8230;. So he can add destiny so he is going to wait for me to battle before he duels.  He has no force left.  I say I will play First Strike, I look at my hand and wait 5 seconds, nothing happens, I will initiate a battle, &amp;#8220;Oh wait. . . I want to duel.&amp;#8221;  &amp;#8220;You have no force you can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;  &amp;#8220;Before you battle.&amp;#8221;  &amp;#8220;I gave you enough time, it is too late.&amp;#8221;  I smoke screen and hit vader he loses him plus 8 or so(I also had played What Is Thy Bidding My Master so he didn&amp;#8217;t get destiny) and draws up on his next turn.  Full win by a number less than 60 and more than 1.<br>
<br>
PROS:  Winning when I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have.<br>
CONS:  Dark Path cost me Ben.  Having to be an @#$% to win but it was his fault. <br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
DS vs. Shane &amp;#8216;Outlaw&amp;#8217; Watner<br>
Not much to report here.  Kicked his ass and shut him down.  Full win by 42(should have been 45 but I forgot to move over to a revolved Obi&amp;#8217;s Hut).<br>
<br>
I end up taking 8th place, which was a little disappointing(I wanted a sheet).  I am really pissed of about that damn test 5 deck, who the Fuck plays that @#$%.  That dark deck was a little effect light and interrupt heavy for my tastes anyway.  <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-	Chris Hines &amp;#8216;Gold 8&amp;#8217;(I think) for doing a great job running the tournament.<br>
-	Lavigne for giving me a ride<br>
-	All the people who came from out of town.<br>
Slops:<br>
-	Keegan Heilman for being such a damn @#$%(and you will rate this 5 *&amp;#8217;s or I will kick your Ass.<br>
-	DJ for being a Jew his play mat, only his cards were allowed on it.<br>
-	DJ for playing degenerative test 5 @#$%.<br>
-	Vacation Village for sucking so much ass.  I still have a head ache form the smoke, other than that it was all right though.<br>
-	Denny&amp;#8217;s for making @#$%ty fajitas.<br>
-	Bobby C. for helping Hines<br>
-	Chris Hood for finishing ahead of me one place.  How did that happen, the guy is only  sub-par and  I can&amp;#8217;t remember the last time he placed in the top half at a local tournament.  I had to beat his Ass after the tourney to put him back in his place though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall it was a lot of fun.  I plan on making it to a few other GS/Cons this year if at all possible.  I can almost guarantee an appearance at the Phoenix GS.  I also plan on making it to Phoenix and California this summer for some local tourneys.   I am also glad that I got to play Kyle Craft even though I got beat, he just shut me down.  Got to go watch TV now.<br>
