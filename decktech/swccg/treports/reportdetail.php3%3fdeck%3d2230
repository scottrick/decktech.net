4-28-2001<br>
<br>
Alrightty then, the weekend starts out Friday, I get up, go to some classes, and then meet Mr. Jay Webb and Jennifer at Subway at 11:30.  We go over to the card shop, get some subs over there, play Counterstrike and wait until 2:30 when John Dunn gets off work.  Please notice that 3 hours just went by.  Now we have to go pick up DJ Andrews up north on the way to Vegas, current time when we leave Phoenix, 4:30, where is all the time going…?  We have an interesting car ride, telling jokes, eating at the McDonald&#146;s in Kingman, finding the area about 16 miles outside Kingman for those who know that story, and head into Vegas.  I was amazed that during both the car trip there and back, we didn&#146;t discuss Star Wars, that was actually nice for how much we would encounter when we arrived.  We get to the hotel about 9:30 and find out our room was magically upgraded, oh good lord was it nice.  We ended up with a 3-bedroom suite with 2 bathroom and a living room bigger than my 2-bedroom dorm.  Sweet! J<br>
<br>
Now it is the time to talk tech.  Dunn&#146;s and Dj&#146;s are basically done so they don&#146;t need any help.  I give my TIE deck to Dunn, since he knows how to play TIEs, he says take out these 3 cards and put these in.  One of these cards I put in was Monnok, later I will discuss how that won me my first 3 games with my dark deck.  Next, on to my pile of a light deck, EBO.  I give them the pile that it is and tell them to start helping the bleeding deck.  Dj starts taking out cards, bout half the deck, then Dunn notices he took out EBO, Dj says &quot;He wanted us to fix his deck right.&quot;  Very cute.  Overall Dunn changed about 10 cards, I put about 5 back or so.  Now that this is all done, its about 2:30 in the morning, I&#146;m sure you all can relate to that.  I head off to bed, Dj and Dunn hit the strip for 2 hours.  Good night.<br>
<br>
Next morning, phone rings at 9:00 I get up, and we all head out to Denny&#146;s since I guess that was the place to go, there are only like 10 in Vegas.  We get to the tournament about 10ish and notice about 60-65 people are there.  We go sign up and I go talk to some home town buddies.  Time for quote number 1, there shall be many.  Steve Marshall asks Brett Kitani, who for some reason took the hotel bible, &quot;what happens when the bible goes up against &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;Brian Hunter&quot;?  Kitani replies, I&#146;ve read the bible, Jesus dies…someone also stated that Jesus gets resurrected.  Little did we know we just highlighted the entire tournament.  We talk, make more jokes, and I start my tournament joke list.  Finally Girard gets the tournament underway and time for me to start losing since I&#146;m a scrub with scrub decks.  For most purposes throughout the tournament I said that anyone I played would be better than me, just to be optimistic.<br>
<br>
My rating 1755<br>
Light Deck, EBO with Strike Planning Do, or do not combo, and Your Insights serve you well start, with Corvettes and non-unique pilots.<br>
<br>
Dark Deck, Set your Course, with TIE Interceptors retrieval<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
My light deck vs. Alfred Dong (1954) MKOS skrillings<br>
<br>
Yeah, he&#146;s playing retreival MKOS and alien rage.  He does his normal start with the Jabba&#146;s Barge and get force, sets up about 3-4 turn.  I go do my stuff, signal for A new secret base, (I&#146;m playing 4 signals).  Bout 3rd He asks how many cards do I have in my hand, I say 12, beginning of my turn, I go get site, 13 now, &quot;monnok used&quot; icky, guess I&#146;m a scrub since this is after I have done my stike planning to get mon mothma and madine.  I am saved by just losing the site I picked up and realized how much I just learned about the deck, never playing it before.  Moral of the story, he came down one turn with Zuckuss, IG, and Bossk, I guess he has space and I don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
FL (-22)<br>
<br>
Goodness, I lost to a deck I should lose to, and someone ranked higher than me, I don&#146;t feel so bad.  I also learned a lot about my deck.<br>
Sadness, I still lost, and at this point don&#146;t think about a TR.<br>
<br>
I go talk to buddies after game, like I did every round, found out most of us lost and waited for next game.<br>
<br>
Next game.<br>
My Dark vs. James Eby (1614) EBO X-wing swarm<br>
<br>
This guy is actually really cool, we talk, joke around, he&#146;s my kind of buddy.  Let me sum up some turns.  One turn around turn 5 or so, EPP vader comes down to Hoth, moves on in since Ice Storm wasn&#146;t out yet.  Next turn, EBO drops and he has 2 x-wings at hoth with Incom on table.  I lost all power to weapons to get some stuff.  I throw down 4 Ties, battle All power to weapons (power 6 Ties) and draw a 3 or 4, I&#146;m about power 28, he&#146;s not.  My Ties are immune I&#146;m cool, move dreadnaught over with merryk and I save 1 force.  Next turn he throws down 1 x-wing and saves a force, I guess he has a Houjix or something.  I Masterful Move for Monnok.  Next turn, monnok lost, oh look, 3 x-wings, 2!!! Hyper Escapes, no Houjix, I don&#146;t have all powers, but I&#146;m power about 30, game, set, match.<br>
<br>
FW (+32)<br>
Total	2(+10)<br>
<br>
Goodness, John Dunn is my hero, Monnok is good.<br>
Sadness, nothing really<br>
<br>
I come back to buddies, told them I won, Shaner won again, and Dj won, the rest of Phoenix is still dying except Shaner beat Hunter, I&#146;m like, woah, nice<br>
<br>
Next game:<br>
My dark, vs. Caleb Smith (1821) Profit Baragwins<br>
<br>
Oh dear g-d, how am I supposed to go up against that with TIEs.  This is by far the best game I have ever had and the best played.  For this I&#146;ll sum up the game.  He is not playing space, yeah.  Both Aim High and Secret Plans, and First Strike are on table.  I Monnok 3 times for stuff, set for stun Han twice, and last turn he lost both cards from his reserve deck and lost his fallen portal.  Yessss, Vader comes down, hits Han, and game is over.  There was one mistake throughout the whole game and it was by Caleb, I had both my spies down, and all three times I monnoked him, he never put Corran Horn down.  Great game or retrieval and tech. <br>
<br>
FW (+14)<br>
Total	4(+24)<br>
<br>
Goodness, I played a real good opponent and a probably about the hardest deck for my TIEs to play against and won.<br>
Monnok for bailing my butt again (thanks Dunn) First Strike and Set for Stun (good card)<br>
<br>
Sadness:  I&#146;m really tired now, and my brain is about to explode.<br>
<br>
I go back talk to friends, find out most people from Phoenix won that round.  I go thank John Dunn again, because he&#146;s my hero, and he&#146;s like, that&#146;s awesome, you won.<br>
<br>
Next game:<br>
My light deck vs. Paul Feldman (2012) Set your course manipulation, with heavy space and tech.<br>
<br>
This is now the second best game I have ever had in my life.  This game involved a great deal of tech and experience.  He came down second turn with M&#146;iyoom Onith on a Dreadnaught, I&#146;m like ?!@# icky.  I get things going about 4th turn, he gets Major Hash and starts to kill my pilots, wait a minute, they are non-unique, haha, he notices I&#146;m playing corvettes and stuff and starts to look grim.  Game consisted of battling, draining, knowing what to do and surviving.  Like the last game, it took about 55 minutes and was well worth the time.  Note to self, Battle Order sucks.  Great game with a great person, he&#146;s a cool guy.  I also used my Shocking Info/Grimtash to make him lose 4 once throughout the game.  There really wasn&#146;t anything decisive, just amazing overall.  Very competitive game.<br>
<br>
FW (+9)<br>
Total	6(+33)<br>
<br>
Goodness: wow, great game, I somehow won.<br>
Sadness: my head really hurts now and I remember Mike saying no food break<br>
<br>
I go back to buddies, find out most everyone from Phoenix won.  I told them I won, and someone goes who did you play this time, Paul Feldman with my EBO deck.  You all have to understand I know about 3 people here from out of state.  Dj says he&#146;s the number ranked guy from California.  I get pats on the back and handshakes for winning and start pissing in my pants I&#146;m playing good people now and somehow winning.  I ask Shaner where he&#146;s at, 6(+32) start whimpering I&#146;ll play him, he sits next to me next round<br>
Yeah J<br>
<br>
Next game:<br>
My dark vs. Jason Makohan (1674) Turn Vader<br>
<br>
From the beginning of the game, I&#146;m like, screw Seinar, I want Vader.  Because I have such a good relationship with my deck (it gives me what I want, I let it win) I start off with both of my EPP Vader&#146;s in my hand. Oh yeah baby.  First turn, 1.2.3.4.5.6 Force, Vader to docking bay.  Next turn, I look at my objective, notice Vader doesn&#146;t take damage on my rock, move over, pick up a Twi&#146;lek and he goes.  He can&#146;t find what he wants out of his deck, I look, just notice wedge in there, so I guess he has him, maybe dash, maybe Home 1.  He throws down EPP Obi-wan, some guys at the war room, and I hope she&#146;s all right.  Game breaking turn, I hit Obi-wan, he misses Vader, that mean that I hope she&#146;s all right goes away because he has to forfeit a hit character first.  He draws a 1, I draw 5, Obi dies, and one more card from top I liked, Draw Their Fire, Note to self (Ties are safe with Ghhhk) I monnok lost, notice he has nothing, Ties come down, and Arica at the War Room.  That moment there was the game, I still have my Vader and all is cool.  He never won a battle against me out of the three.<br>
<br>
FW (+22)<br>
Total	8(+55)<br>
<br>
Again I go back, tell all I won, I&#146;m 4-1 not bad for a scrub.  Everyone says good job, I tell Dunn monnok helped win, knowing what was in his hand.  Remember to always give praise to the person that helps design you deck, those people are cool.  Next round I sit next to my buddy Shaner again on table 2, Table 2!, I don&#146;t belong there.<br>
<br>
Next game:<br>
My light vs. Ted Hanson (1804) ISB Space<br>
<br>
Great, I knew this was going to be a tough game, I&#146;m on table 2.  There are 2 game breaking turns, his was just a little more important than mine.  1 turn at the beginning he used Piett&#146;s game text and didn&#146;t get Merryk, sweet.  Another turn, he canceled my Arcona&#146;s react and the arcona took it up the butt for 8 included haven and for some reason I lost Honor (scrub move), even though the arconna alone was power 5, bonuses rule.  Game came down to he thought he was going to win by a lot full win, I got an extra drain of 6 off, and if I had one more turn I would have won, timed game, he had 6 cards, I had 3<br>
<br>
TL/FL	(-6)<br>
Total	8(+49)<br>
<br>
Goodness:  I played a real good game, 1 I probably would have won if I had Honor out.  I&#146;m still not that bad a position for top 10, just difference sucks.<br>
<br>
Sadness:  I lost, but it was a great game and a good opponent.<br>
<br>
I go back, tell them I lost a game, everyone&#146;s like oh well.  I find out Shaner lost, by 3 timed game as well, icky, I really don&#146;t want to play him, he&#146;s my buddy.<br>
<br>
Next game:<br>
My light deck vs. Chris Shaner (1948) ISB Signature deck<br>
<br>
I lose…<br>
He gets 8 guys on table turn 2, scum Jabba, Chall, Ability…and I take it up the butt and say thank you sir may I please have another.  Shaner owned, I leased out<br>
<br>
FL (-31) OWWWWWW<br>
Total	8(+18) so much for diff<br>
<br>
Goodness: None to mention, Shaner has good chance for finals now, that about it<br>
Sadness:  I lost, big deal, it wasn&#146;t the best light deck invented.<br>
<br>
I go back, tell all what happened, I played Shaner, I go to Shaner, it&#146;s been 20 minutes, we go to the MU now and get food.  We eat, feel better, and return for last game.<br>
<br>
Last Game:<br>
My dark vs. Brian Garrison (1677) Hidden Mains<br>
I&#146;ve beaten this before so I thought I was ok, I was.  I got one spy, my retrieval going with First strike and TIEs, blocked force drains, and that was about it.  Permanent Ghhhk on my rock with first strike is broken.  I took a couple drains.  Game was pretty quick and mostly involved battling with First Strike and retrieving.<br>
<br>
FW (+27)<br>
Total 10(+45)<br>
<br>
Goodness: I won<br>
Sadness:  I beat a Phoenix buddy, and I know that was the last deck he wanted to see that tournament let alone finish with it.<br>
<br>
I go back and find out I did pretty good, 5-3 yippie.  I find out that they are giving away stuff for 1-12 places, I get 13.  Flashback, the first tournament I ever went to was at the Safari Hotel in Phoenix Regional event.  I finished 9th place out of 54 right behind Girard so I didn&#146;t get a plaque.  To think to this day I am still where I started, a good player, is amazing. I also have the memory now, of playing EBO, in every major event I&#146;ve been in, all 3 regional events, and now DPC.  Overall it was a great day.  I was hardly contested in space the whole day and my light deck won one game against Paul Feldman who is a really cool guy and great player. (and ranked 400 points above me)<br>
<br>
Before I go to the finals, here are some other quotes from the weekend.<br>
<br>
Jay - &quot;Thrawn, he&#146;ll die&quot;<br>
Dj - &quot;Whoosh, all gone&quot; (he put a sandwhirl in his dark deck)<br>
Jay - &quot;People think I&#146;m older until I tell them what I do in my spare time.&quot;<br>
Dj - &quot;Why don&#146;t you go to McWaanald&#146;s so you can order a Waaaburger and some French Cries&quot;  &quot;Let me call the Waaambulance, 9 waaa waaa&quot;<br>
Choogie - &quot;My deck just got worse&quot;<br>
Choogie - &quot;Don&#146;t worry Shaner, you&#146;re no longer my apprentice&quot; (inside joke)<br>
Shaner - &quot;plus 2&quot; - Craft &quot;for a Droid!&quot; (in final match)<br>
Jay - &quot;look, Optimus Prime&quot; (exact replica of a semi on way back.&quot;<br>
Jay - &quot;I catch your waa, pay a force to waaa&quot; (this was part of a very funny conversation)<br>
Dj - &quot;Ape Smash&quot; (this quote is still pending meaning)<br>
<br>
My favorite from John Dunn:<br>
&quot;That is why I have a W in my column, and you have an L in your column&quot;<br>
<br>
Now on to the finals, the final 4 consisted of:<br>
1. Jonathan Chu 14(+129)<br>
2. Kyle Craft 13(+138)<br>
3. Chris Shaner 12(+107)<br>
4. Brian Hunter 12(+97)<br>
Jason Kilby <br>
Arian Delisle <br>
Tim Guzman <br>
Paul Feldman <br>
Ted Hanson <br>
Caleb Smith <br>
<br>
Chu plays Hunter, Craft plays Shaner, (a realization was fathomed over the weekend that Phoenix players go by last names for players)<br>
<br>
Shaner&#146;s Turn Vader vs. Craft&#146;s Black Sun Agents:<br>
<br>
I watch Shaner&#146;s game first because he is my buddy.  I&#146;ll sum up 2 turns in the game.  1.  Shaner comes down with EPP Obi-wan, kills Xizor and gets a card.  3 turns later, Xizor gets &quot;ape smashed&quot; by EPP Obi, General Solo and Chewbacca, Xizor gets hit, Shaner draws a 5, Craft flips his reserve deck into his lost pile.  Game lasted 10 minutes and I&#146;ve never seen Kyle go down like that before.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Chu&#146;s Hidden Mains vs. Hunter&#146;s ISB Space<br>
<br>
This was a fairly good game, but Hunter controlled space and got his drains off.  Hunter ended up winning to play in the finals.  I guess getting 3rd and 4th isn&#146;t bad if you play in the final round for a grand…<br>
<br>
Final Confrontation, Shaner plays Light first against Hunter&#146;s ISB deck.<br>
Shaner gets his deck rolling and Hunter sets up his deck, throwing ozzel down first turn, then Vader the next.  Shaner packs up stuff at the docking bay, and Hunter starts going to space.  There was like one battle, Shaner was power 38, Hunter was 15, after that, Hunter stayed away until the final turn and drained in space uncontested.<br>
<br>
Hunter FW (+8) I think<br>
<br>
Next game, opposite sides, Shaner&#146;s ISB Signature deck against Hunter&#146;s Hidden Mains.  This was more a drain game than anything.  Shaner beat Hunter earlier in the tournament and I think that is why he lost, Hunter now knew how to play against the deck.  Hunter had Menace Fades going throughout the game and Shaner had to pay for his drains.  Hunter ended up winning the game and the money.  Everyone clapped for the players and pictures were taken.  I stay for a minute to say goodbye to everyone knowing I won&#146;t see a lot of people I met for awhile, sadness.  I&#146;ll be back for another tournament out of state, everyone was so cool and I had so much fun.  I end up getting a ride back with Marshall with 6 people, (car only fits 5, guess who gets the @#$% seat of midair in the front).  We go back to their place to drop off some stuff and say hello to the others.  This was funny, we get there and Hickey answers the door.  First thing he says, &quot;Hey guys what&#146;s up, the beers are in the sink.&quot;  We laugh, go sit down, talk about our decks, find out that me and Dj were the only ones to have a deck go undefeated, my dark, his light.  We discuss how Steve Marshall is somehow 21 and can do everything legally, to this day that is a mystery.  We head out, show them our palace of a hotel, drop our stuff and head for the strip.<br>
<br>
Funny moment, Shaner saw Casey and Nathan, and actually RAN, Shaner moved in a rapid fashion to catch up to them and we hung out with them eventually going to where, none other than Denny&#146;s.  I&#146;ve never seen Shaner do that before.  We eat at non other than Denny&#146;s and then head back for sleep.  Next day we get up go eat desert at Café Billagio for dessert.  That was good.  Dj looked at his small brownie he ordered, whispers &quot;That&#146;s the smallest brownie I&#146;ve ever seen.&quot;  5 seconds later, &quot;This is the most godly brownie I have ever had.&quot;  Turns out it was so filling he couldn&#146;t finish the last bite, said they probably used a pressure cooker for it lol.  Anyhow, we go to Ceaser&#146;s I watch Dj be a g-d at Star Wars arcade game, getting first, Dunn makes me gamble a game, who was I to argue, then we go to GameWorks.  Dj climbs the rock, Jay loses a bet to Dunn he wouldn&#146;t make it.  Dj can apparently climb well.  We have a great ride home and that was about it for the weekend.<br>
<br>
Props to Michael Girard for running a very good tournament with help from Mike Sinclair and Nathan.  The prizes and company were great.  Thanks to Jay Webb for the car ride up and the amazing crib for the weekend.  I&#146;m probably the only person who can say they spent $75 dollars for the entire weekend in Vegas. <br>
<br>
Slops to me for still being the scrub I am.  Pat for not coming down for some reason and having a blast with all of us.  Girard for giving out cheesey raffles, who wants a foil Savrip? j/k big guy.  Eating only at Denny&#146;s or McD&#146;s everytime.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the great games for the people I played against, even the ones I lost.  Hope to see everyone down the road.  I went 5-3, that is so amazing.  Also, I played 4 people in the tournament that finished in the top 10, not bad for coming in 13th after all of that.<br>
