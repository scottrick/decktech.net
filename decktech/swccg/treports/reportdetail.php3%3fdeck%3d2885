I&#146;m in a car with Andy Klema driving to McDonalds…I say you want to go to the DPC Montreal?  Klema says, I&#146;m all about that. The following week I contact Mike Gemme, Steve Baroni and we are all set to go.  Baroni talks to Alex Klamerodt and he hooks us up with a place to stay(mad cool).  Later on that week baroni finds out he cant go because of some stupid reason. Gemme decides to go with the twiggs…so now it is not looking so good for me going &#146;cuz all that is left of our crew is me klema and klema&#146;s friend Cody.  We say @#$% it, we&#146;re still going.  We&#146;re taking klema&#146;s car and the plan is for me to take the train down to klema&#146;s house(Connecticut) and then we drive up to Montreal.  I tell my parents I&#146;m just going to Connecticut for the weekend and they are like, whatever…you spend way to much time on that game.  Everything is working well until klema tells me that he, cody and their friend dave(who doesn&#146;t even play cards) have changed the plan are instead picking me up in Boston on the way to Montreal(actually it makes sense geographically) and are crashing at my house thurs night.  Hmmmmm…parents could find out so the following lies are implemented.<br>
<br>
-Klema and dave are coming down from a fishing trip in Montreal and are staying at our house Thursday night.-This lie is implemented to cover for the fact of why klema would be in mass if the tourney is supposedly in Connecticut(aka near his house).  The reason the fishing trip in Montreal lie is used, is just in-case something slips about Montreal and my parents hear it…we can can be like, we were just talking about the fishing trip<br>
<br>
…I am the best liar in the world.<br>
<br>
Ok well thurs night rolls around and the conn crew shows up.  The night involves the following:<br>
-lying<br>
-Dave punching cody and slapping Klema<br>
-us trying to teach dave how to play star wars and failing.<br>
<br>
Aight…so Friday morning rolls around and we set out for Montreal….as we leave my mom is like, call em when you get to Connecticut .<br>
<br>
Ok, so we set out in Andy&#146;s car and about 5 minutes into the trip in the outskirts of boston we clip a car and our right mirror is no longer attached to the car.  Not good.  well I come up with a lie Klema can tell his parenets so it&#146;s not as bad as it first seems…and the right mirror is a useless device anyway so whatever.  <br>
Highlights of the trip:<br>
<br>
-seeing some guy have spasms in mcdonalds<br>
-yelling live free or die!  Whoooooo!! to a car with NH plates(their slogan).<br>
-waving to 54624565 girls<br>
and then there is the ultimate highlight which deserves it&#146;s own paragraph…<br>
<br>
…We are in northern Vermont and we see this girl and dave waves…no big deal.  Only she doesn&#146;t wave back, only smiles.  Well for about 10 minutes we&#146;re playing cat and mouse on the highway catching up to her and waving and her just laughing but not waving.  Finnaly I decide to flash my nips at her, Mike Gemme @applebees style.  So I do this and we get a wave.  So we are all happy and she speeds off and is about 50 feet in front of us.  So we catch up to her and she has taken off her shirt and is now down to a tanktop!!!!  Also her hair was different so it was all very cool.  Ok end of story.**Cough** Ds testing** Cough**<br>
<br>
Well we get into Canada and it is cool…about 25 minutes into the trip we realize thet quest means west and now we now where we are going.  We get to alex&#146;s house with not that many problems and we are mad early so we got to the supermarket and buy some beer. around 6:30 alex shows up and we crash in his apartment.  <br>
<br>
Alex is mad mad mad cool.  His apartment is…umm….well it&#146;s nice.( like I said I am a good liarJ And we just chill their for awhile(aka me getting drunk and drinking all the beer that was a present for alex, and klema and alex just get high.  We were gunna go out…but we got high.  I test my decks out and my huntdown jizz takes out alex&#146;s qmc and my wys drowns vs his huntdown but I am satisfied with the decks because I know them like the back of my hand…and that is the important thing in big tourneys.  About 12 alex&#146;s friend comes over(inspecta deck, on dt).  The kid is cool but he has waaaaaay to much energy.  he is bouncing off the walls.  well anyway we all crash on the floor and we have to get up at 7:00.  five minutes later it&#146;s seven and we get up…I am dehydrated…very dehydrated.  But it is ok, because every tourney I have gone to where I got drunk the night before I have done well in.<br>
<br>
 We head out to the bus station and take a bus to Montreal…I end up paying like $5 American just to let the bus driver let us on with American money.  Just let me say…anytime you offer Canadians American money and say do you take American, their eyes light up and they say, money is money and they take it and give you an awful exchange rate. <br>
<br>
We walk 6476457676 blocks and get to the rec center and see about 40 people there.  The notables:<br>
-Jon Chu<br>
-yannick<br>
_Dom(not playing)<br>
-raph asselin<br>
-Clint hays<br>
-Miek Gemme<br>
-Twiggs<br>
…and a bunch of other American players and few canandian players.<br>
<br>
I talk to Gemme for awhile and he tells me he is not playing the wys that we have been playtesting for 2 months but instead he is going to play test to five that him and twigg came up with 4 hours ago.  I beg him not to play it and alex even tells him to play what he knows but he plays dagobah and asses himself.  I fill out my decklists and we get going around 12:30<br>
<br>
The DPC Montreal-<br>
<br>
game one my light wys solid vs sorry I don&#146;t remember your name huntdown racing sevens.<br>
<br>
Well he throws out his starting stuff and I show wys and he is like, I have never lost to wys, it is and auto win vs. my deck  Well I play huntdown racing too and know that wys is it&#146;s hardest matchup…so I figure this guy is full of @#$%…Well the game sets up and he blasts off and draws a 7.  I have a step back in my hand so I am not worried.  he loses to visage and loses a seven.  Hmmmmm...I set up early and flip with melas on the ground and wedge in space and shut down his activation.  I play a step back and he says s.hit.  I draw pretty good for the race(I think a 5 and a 2 in that order).  He draws another seven.  Well I am draining him for a bunch and I get kesel out and drain for more.  But every card he loses is a seven.  I mean his lost pile is about 15 cards and it&#146;s all sevens.  Well the race is pretty close but everytime he draws a seven I step back it and eventually he stacks a 1 and a 3 and I win the race.  I retrieve 11 and he loses 11…I then blow up his holotable…4 more force please…then I drain him for 6…pretty much game.  He comes down late with maul and duels luke but it doesn&#146;t even matter at that point.  Full win by 24.<br>
<br>
Highs-winning the race.  My deck dominating.<br>
Lows-  he played 27 sevens.<br>
<br>
Well Gemme won with his dark, klema beat chu timed which is cool.  Pretty much everyone good won.<br>
<br>
game 2  My huntdown racing vs Gogolan&#146;s sore peter.<br>
<br>
lemme first say that I am awhare of the whoel gogolan Gemme thing and I am going to leave this out of the game description.  Well he doesn&#146;t start  a podracer so I don&#146;t blast off and he draws a 5 and I draw dark lord.  I have no characters in my opening hand or my opening draw…I have a hand that is 12 cards…10 high destiny reds and 2 vaders sabers.  @#$% that sucks.  He sets up in space and is causing me major damage along with visage…about turn 3 I finally get Vader down but he just drops Luke at another site.  Well he plays a step back about 3 times even though I grabbed it.  And I guess when you don&#146;t have a podracer you don&#146;t put your destinies back with a step back…or at least that&#146;s how they ruled it.  So he wins the race without a racer and wins the game by only 13 but it still sucks to lose.<br>
<br>
Highs-None<br>
Lows-losing the race without a racer comes to mind.  If I played him again I would blast off and I pretty sure I would win.<br>
<br>
Well Gemme loses loses and puts me on the bad list for losing to gogs.  Everyone else won…chu beat cody.  Matt socal follows me around when I tell my story about how I lost the race without a racer and laughs really hard when I tell it but it is cool because matt is the man.<br>
<br>
So game 3 I am 1-1 and figure I&#146;ll play a scrub…well I play jon chu….hmmmmm I guess I didn&#146;t get my wish.<br>
<br>
game 3-My dark vs. Chu&#146;s sore peter with mods…<br>
<br>
Well he doesn&#146;t start a podarcer but I blast off anyway.  he sets up kessel and tatooine and can&#146;t get a guy down to tatooine because of bubo(he is the machine).  vader and palpl come down to tatooine and drain.  I win the race(horay!) but he ICBW&#146;s it then plays a few edges and basically the game starts over because neither of us have a lost pile.  Only problem is he is draining me for 4 and has retrieval…I am draining him for 3 and have no more retrieval.  Hmmmm…my only chance is maul in space and hope he can&#146;t find his melas…I have 2 mauls in hand but no ship…I draw for a ship but he losts grims and gets my mauls and OOC&#146;s him…that is pretty much game.  Luke comes down late and satisfies battle plan.  Limited resources makes it kinda close…But he wins by 16.<br>
<br>
Highs-Great game.  I really like playing against Chu…you are cool chu!<br>
Lows-nada<br>
<br>
Well I am 1-2 and sorta pissed.  Gemme lost again with his light.  chris twigg lost to clint and klema.  Clint, yannick, raph, gogs and klema are 3-0 along with a few others.<br>
<br>
game four…my ls vs tom dowlings senate naboo occupation.<br>
<br>
I am worried at first but he starts a naboo site so I figure I will be able to win.  I set up in space and luke on tatooine and am draining for a ton..he is doing occupation for 1 and drain for 2 which gets controled every turn.  he comes down with mara, vader and maul but they all dies and luke lives…sorry about the mess is a good card.  I just have too much board control and I win by 22.  Sorry I don&#146;t remember much about this game.<br>
Highs-It&#146;s a wina nd he was cool.<br>
Lows-nada.<br>
<br>
I am 2-2 and figure with a little luck I can go 5-3 which won&#146;t be that bad.  yannick beat clint, raph beat klema, brian twigg lost to alex(alex is now 4-0) and Gemme won with his dark.<br>
<br>
game five-my wys vs some player from canada…people told me he is really good.  Well he is a cool guy when we first sit down and all but then when we are starting the game he insists that effects are revealed simultaneosly and I say no, SIs are…I get to see your effetcts first…well Dom comes over and sides with me and Dom is my hero.  Well he starts mpoints and some senate stuff….I start my usual and dont&#146; do that again.  he sets up the senate and makes me drop 2 cards every turn.  I set up kessel and tatooine.  he has maul in the cantina.  he drains me for 2 a turn and I drain him for 3(cancelled) and 1…if he just rides this out he prolly wins…But he comes to spece…I barrier fett in ship againt mirax(he lateralled).  Next turn super falcon with captain han…win the battle by 12…fet and 6 cards…legendary star fighter.  game over…he pings me hear and there but I just cause too much damage.  He played very well but made one key mistake throught the game…every time he made me drop cards…he drained me first, so I would lose cards like barrier and dodge to lost pile where I could play them…this was key and cost him the game.  Full win by 18.<br>
Highs-I played really well this game.  WYS is 3-0.<br>
Los-nada.<br>
<br>
So Gemme lost again with his light, clint lost to some random dude…chu won, alex lost to gogs and got added to the list…yannick won(?).  <br>
<br>
well I am 3-2 now and figure 5-3 can happen if I focus.<br>
<br>
game 6 my dark vs. Greg Hodur&#146;s sore peter(more like chus&#146;)<br>
<br>
Agggggg!!!!  My first three games with my dark I play all against ghetto sore peter wys.  dammit.  But it is cool to play against hodur since he is cool.  The game starts out the same as the last two except two things are different, I get maul and his ship in my hand and hodur can&#146;t find a icbw for the podrace.  so after I win the podrace I am looking pretty good but he still has the kessel drain and tatooine drain going strong and he is cancelling all my drains on land.  I get maul in space to tatooine and melas is no where to be seen.   So now I am draining for 5 a turn and he can&#146;t play it&#146;s a hit to cancl the cantina drain because he doesn&#146;t control tatooine.  he edges at the end and the game is really really close but limited resourses twice and it&#146;s worse win it for me by 5.<br>
Highs-My dark won<br>
Lows-limited resourses twice is gay.<br>
<br>
Well Gemme won with his dark again so the wys he didn&#146;t play which I did play is 3-0 and his dark is 3-0.damn.  yanncik lost to gogs(how?!?!)  and alex beat twigg.  So the top looks like this:<br>
gogs-6-0<br>
yannick-5-1<br>
alex 5-1<br>
raph5-1?<br>
a bunch 4-2…<br>
<br>
Ok so game seven is upon us and I am tired and hungry,  I play twigg.<br>
<br>
My dark racing vs. twigg&#146;s test to five.<br>
<br>
Well I know I will win this game because test to five is like an auto win and I play chybc.  I drop guys to the arena and win the race…he does his test thing.  he loses 11 and visage is causing him some problems.<br>
he uses corran to cancel visage then I drop maul but he kills corran on the edge and maul is stuck on the executor.  Qui gon comes down and kills vader and the emp and all of a sudden I am losing 2 force a turn to test 6…and I am causing him no damage.  I am totally phucked and all I can do is just lose 2 force to drop visage and hope it makes it close.  We lose to visage and he plays it could be worse…I look at the 10 force in my force pile and the it&#146;&#146;s worse in my hand and say lose 10.  he loses 10 then 4 to limited resourses and the game.  Full win by 11.<br>
<br>
Highs-I won<br>
Lows-I won in a gay way.<br>
<br>
So now I&#146;m five and 2 and am like holy @#$% a win might put me in the final.  Alex is telling me any win will put me or him in the final(we are both 5-2 with the same diff).  So I am excited.<br>
The situation:<br>
Gogs play martin pauquet 7-0 vs. 5-2<br>
yanncik plays raph 6-1 vs 5-2 high diff<br>
chu plays alex 5-2 vs 5-2<br>
I play patrick dineele(sp?) 5-2 vs 5-2.<br>
<br>
So I figure if I win by a lot I can get in.  <br>
Game 8 my ls vs. pat d&#146;s bhbm jizz. <br>
he starts podracing and watto&#146;s box.  I start my standard stuff…he drops palp first trun to the throne room and starts the race.  I drop mirax to tatooine first trun and say go(I have nothing else to flip which sucks).  he drops tech mor and inserts and says go.  I say phuck.  But I just drop jedi luke to the home one docking bay for 3 and say go(my 9 to his 12 for odds).  the race goes on and on but I cancel two of his collsions and play a step back at the right times and win the race.  I drain in space and edge for a few.  vader comes out but I just cause too much damage.  full win by 26.<br>
Highs- am I in?<br>
Lows-am I in?<br>
<br>
Well chu beat alex by 23 so chu is ahead of me.  gogs loses to pauquet but it&#146;s timed so pauquet is out and gogs is in…yannick loses to raph so raph is in and it was so close that yannick is still in and I am 5th by 4 diff…darn.  I am disappointed but I went 6-2 finished a head of a bunch of good players and went a damn cool winning streak at the end so I&#146;m not that pissed.<br>
After the tourny I say latas to klema and his crew and alex since I am going back with Gemme and twiggs.  We leave Montreal and get the hell back to our country.  We make fun of chris shout all the way back because he is a loser and the next day I almost kill me and Gemme on the highway because I fell alseep while driving for 8 seconds.  All in all it was a damn cool weekend.  Sunday morning I get back to my house…how was Connecticut?  oh it was good.<br>
