6 Nov 99, Syracuse NY<br>
<br>
Well, it's been a long while since I've written a tourney report, mainly<br>
because this was my first constructed tournament since August.  I'd like<br>
to think I'm not out of practice, though, since I play online a lot.  In<br>
any case, this was one of the 'big' tourneys in Coruscant, where people<br>
from all over the region came.  We ended up with 26 people, with 4 2000+<br>
people there: TJ Holman, Wojtek Jankowski, and Brian and Chris<br>
Terwilliger.<br>
<br>
Here's a brief summary of my decks.  My Light deck is a MWYHL/MnT deck<br>
that trains some 4-ability alien to Test 2 (Melas, Tawss, or Orrimaarko,<br>
whichever I draw first).  Luke and Leia are much too important to be<br>
stuck on Dagobah. :-)  My deck has I believe 13 cards that are destiny 5<br>
and above, meaning Jedi Testing is usually not a problem, and works good<br>
with EPPs, naturally.  I've got a nice complement of anti-Hunt Down<br>
cards as well.  The deck works pretty well, but it has a history of<br>
problems versus Space decks and Endor Ops.  As for my Dark deck, I was<br>
playing a Hunt Down variant that I got from Mike Dalton who got it from<br>
John Arendt.  It starts IAO, pulls Docking Bays, duels, and has 3<br>
Visages to make sure one's always out (who uses 3 Terminateds?).  It was<br>
fairly untested for me, but seems to work well enough.<br>
<br>
Anyway, me and my friend Spencer got there, and everyone is pretty much<br>
set into teams, so we end up on 'Team Leftovers'. :-)  It ends up being<br>
me, Spencer, Bart Robinson, and Tony Vigliotti.  Anyway, Ted P. goes<br>
through the pairings, and after some time gets to me.  I'm playing<br>
Wojtek.  I actually looked forward to playing him, mighty though he may<br>
be, it's good to give my decks a good trial by fire once in a while. <br>
Plus, I've never played him before.  So I look around for Wojtek, and<br>
don't see him anywhere.  After a few minutes, I find he's on the ground<br>
near TJ still building his deck. :-)  Anyway, by the time he gets done,<br>
there's like no seats left, we end up sitting next to a Magic<br>
tournament.  (This store's amazing, they were simultaneously running<br>
Star Wars, Magic, and Pokemon tournaments!)  On with the games...<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Dark vs. Wojtek Jankowski's [2012] CC Celebration<br>
<br>
Wojtek was playing the deck that like all the good Philly players play<br>
nowadays.  He started Hidden Base, I started my normal stuff.  He gets<br>
out Tatooine and Bespin, I get out Executor and Endor Docking Bays.  I<br>
deploy EPP Vader at the Endor Docking Bay and flip.  He deploys Daughter<br>
there.  I know he's probably going to deploy Obi or Luke there next turn<br>
and beat Vader into a bloody pulp next turn, so I fight Leia, chop her<br>
in half, and cause some Force loss, and lose Vader to attrition.  He<br>
deploys Jeroen and Wioslea to cancel Visage, then moves Wioslea over to<br>
the Meditation Chamber.  I deploy CHYBC, then deploy Zuckuss to beat on<br>
Wioslea, but Wioslea POLRs away.  He deploys the Tantive with some pilot<br>
to Bespin.  I deploy the Bus and a Dreadnaught and go fight it.  He<br>
loses the pilot, I lose the Dread.  He then deploys a Bacta Tank and<br>
some other pilot on the Tantive, and battles the Bus.  Bus is lost, his<br>
pilot goes to the Tank.  I deploy the Devastator with Evax and take out<br>
the Tantive easily.  Meanwhile, he's deployed a ton of stuff on the<br>
Executor, where's he's not draining.  Melas comes and and sits in front<br>
of Zuckuss, Zuckuss doesn't care, he deploys some guys and kill Zuckuss<br>
+ 3.  He has 2 Cloud City sites out, and deploys Son at one and Pucumir<br>
at the other.  I decline to go beat up Pucumir because POLR could make<br>
that bad for my health.  I finally get Vader and all his dueling<br>
equipment.  He has 2 battleground sites now, so he can drain at the<br>
Executor sites.  I deploy Vader to Son's site, but Vader's apparently a<br>
lot more patient than I am, and decides It Can Wait.  I have Bane or<br>
someone go beat up Pucumir eventually, he takes some damage from it.  He<br>
tries to Docking Bay Transit EPP Han from the Executor to Endor to get<br>
his second battleground, but then realizes that would cost 16 Force.<br>
:-)  So he deploys someone there, and also gets out a 3rd CC Site.  I deploy Vader, he POLRs Luke over<br>
to the third CC site.  I get out Vader's Stick, he kills Bane somehow (I<br>
forget), Vader starts walking over to Luke.  All the while, I'm still<br>
draining for 2 at Bespin.  I swallow another turn of drains because I<br>
didn't get rid of Luke and I have no one to drop on the guy at Endor. <br>
He, surprisingly enough, moves Luke right in front of Vader.  I deploy<br>
Tarkin, but he also decides that It Can Wait.  At this point, I know it<br>
has to be a set up.  But I have confidence in my destiny, as I have at<br>
least 12 cards that are 6+, and lots more if you count 5's.  And if I<br>
don't deal with Luke, I'm facing more drains on the Executor.  I Epic<br>
Obsession, he draws 5,5, which I was somewhat expecting.  I draw a<br>
3,2,1.  Argh!  I probably should have looked for a Docking Bay with IAO<br>
to make sure the chances of that happening were relatively low.  Anyway, I<br>
lose Vader and 9, he drains for lots on the Executor, I keep draining<br>
for 2 at Bespin, he ends up winning by 4.  After the game he points out<br>
that he forgot to pay for Battle Order one turn, might've cost me the<br>
game, maybe not.  My thoughts are Vader losing the duel completely cost<br>
me the game. :-)  FL-4, 0(-4)<br>
<br>
Highlights: I almost beat Wojtek!<br>
Lowlights: I could've beat Wojtek and I didn't.  Blah.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Light vs. Wojtek Jankowski's [2012] Ominous Rumors<br>
<br>
Well, apparently I didn't have enough fun the first time, because now I<br>
get to play Wojtek again!  I was somewhat disappointed at this, as after<br>
one loses against a good person, one generally wants to beat on some<br>
not-so-good person to get one's ego back up.  Anyway, as I mentioned<br>
earlier, my Light deck has problems against Space and Endor Ops decks,<br>
and Ominous Rumors is both, so this game is somewhat ugly for me.  I get<br>
both my tests done relatively early, which hinders his effectiveness<br>
quite a bit.  And he deploys Broken Concentration the next turn and<br>
curses himself. :-)  Anyway, I start out with a Jeroen Webb and a<br>
Revolution in my hand, two great ways to invade the Bunker. <br>
Unfortunately, I can't seem to draw my EPPs early enough, and Ephant Mon<br>
comes down before I can make a mess of things.  I get the Redemption in<br>
my hand and a Bacta Tank out, so I decide to try to contest him in<br>
space.  He deploys a bunch of crap on the ground and flips Endor Ops.  I<br>
deploy my Redemption at Endor, with Chewie, Han, and Jeroen.  I battle,<br>
forgetting that the flipped Endor Ops affects everywhere, so I only get<br>
one destiny.  He loses something, I lose Jeroen.  Anyway, some stuff I<br>
don't remember happens, Chewie ends up in the Bacta Tank, the Redemption<br>
is Lateral Damaged, and I deploy Gold Leader with Harc Seff and beat up<br>
some Dreadnaught at Nal Hutta.  He chases the Redemption, leaving but a<br>
single Dreadnaught at Endor.  I take a chance and send the Redemption<br>
back to Endor instead of going to Nal Hutta to get rid of Lateral (Gold<br>
Leader can't get to Endor).  Anyway, he deploys more stuff and beats up<br>
the Redemption, and eventually drains me out.  FL-21, 0(-25)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Umm...<br>
Lowlights: This is definitely *not* how I wanted to start my day.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My Dark vs. Spencer Hamblen's [1555] Droids/Odds/AFA/SAssaults<br>
<br>
Well, this is another game I'd rather not have happened, as Spencer and<br>
I already playtested the matchup last night.  Anyway, I know exactly<br>
what's in his deck, and he knows exactly what's in mine, but it turns<br>
out that's a lot better for me than him.  I get Vader out at the Cloud<br>
City docking bay, flip Hunt Down, and start draining.  He gets 8D8<br>
down.  At this point, he's playing ICBW many, many times so I draw and<br>
get my Hell To Pay.  I deploy Snugglebear and DS-61-2 at the Endor<br>
Docking Bay, giving me a total of 6 for Odds.  I deploy Search And<br>
Destroy, which basically works like another Visage against people who<br>
don't occupy battleground sites.  He gets out Battle Plan and Wars Not<br>
Make One Great, and inserts AFA and Odds, even though he's losing at<br>
Odds at the moment.  He cancels Visage with Transmission Terminated.  I<br>
use Masterful Move to grab another one and deploy it.  I activate a lot<br>
hoping his Odds come up but they don't.  I Grab his ICBW, he deploys<br>
more droids so he's actually winning at Odds.  Anyway, things go on, he<br>
Blue Milks me a lot so I have to activate, I make him lose Force for<br>
Visage and S+D.  Odds pops once, I Torture it.  AFA pops a few times, I<br>
lose my Force.  And he, of course, deploys more.  At one point, I have<br>
19 cards in my hand (I also know he's not playing Grim), he plays Recoil<br>
In Fear, shuffles my I draw a new hand out of the about 40 Force I have<br>
left, and nothing pops. :-)  He cancels Visage again, I deploy it<br>
again.  In the end, I'm dealing 4 damage to him every turn even if I<br>
don't drain, he loses vital cards for his We're Doomed combo, and I end<br>
up winning by 36.  FW+36, 2(+11)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Losing my 3rd game in a row would have been excruciatingly<br>
bad.<br>
Lowlights: I had to play Spencer, when we came together and we knew each<br>
other's decks.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My Light vs. Greg Hodur's [1619] ISB Operations<br>
<br>
I've actually played my MWYHL Mains deck vs. Greg Hodur's ISB deck<br>
before at the last tourney I was at, and I ended up losing by 1.  I'd<br>
consider my deck to be better now than it was then, so I think I have a<br>
good chance at this.  He drops some Endor sites, I'm drawing some<br>
looking for a suitable apprentice.  He Monnok Losts me, I lose a couple<br>
EPP Lukes, and a couple Shocks (nowhere to Shock yet), I'd prefer not to<br>
see the Lukes, but stuff happens.  I get Orrimaarko I think through the<br>
tests, and he deploys a bunch of stuff at Kiffex.  I deploy a Bacta<br>
Tank, then Redemption with Han, Leia, and Chewie at Kiffex and battle. <br>
My destiny is 1,1,1, ugh, worst possible destiny draws.  Leia goes to<br>
the Bacta Tank, but Redemption think its buff and stays at Kiffex.  His<br>
turn, he deploys Lateral Damage on Dagobah, I inform him that you can't<br>
deploy Utinni Effects on Dagobah so he deploys it on Coruscant instead. <br>
He drops at bunch of stuff at Kiffex, battles me, and I lose everything<br>
+11.  I deploy Obi and Tawss Khaa at one of the Endor sites, he deploys<br>
U-3P0 there.  He deploys Endor, I deploy the Tantive there with a pilot,<br>
he deploys the Avenger there with a pilot, I prove more mighty because<br>
of my high destiny and my Bacta.  Anyway, I got Leia back, deployed her<br>
at the other Endor site, and moved Tawss over.  He deploys 5D6-RA-7 so I<br>
can only drain for one there.  Meanwhile, he's deployed the Defense<br>
Perimeter and dropped some guys there.  I'm draining for a very little<br>
bit, he's draining at Kiffex and the Defense Perimeter, I lose by 26. <br>
FL-26, 2(-15)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Again, I'm drawing a blank...<br>
Lowlights: I crashed, and I crashed hard.  At this point, I was<br>
beginning to doubt my chances at going 3-3... :-(<br>
<br>
Game 4: My Light vs. Chris Ruddy's [1521] CC Sabacc/Dark Deal/Occupation<br>
<br>
I didn't know or know of Chris before, so I wasn't quite sure what to<br>
expect.  He starts Cloud City and Combat Readinesses for some exterior<br>
CC site, I start Battle Plan thinking he's going for big drains.  I get<br>
my tests off fairly fast, and he deploys 2 more exterior CC sites and<br>
some guys to one of them with POTF.  I deploy EPP Luke, EPP Leia, and<br>
Harc Seff to that site, and beat his guys up, losing Harc.  He gets a<br>
couple Obsidian Squad TIEs to Cloud City.  I'm fairly happy draining for<br>
3 at the CC site.  He deploys EPP Vader there, misses Leia, Luke hits<br>
him, and I lose Leia to attrition.  I deploy Obi's Hut with Ben there,<br>
Nabrun Ben in to Luke's site, then deploy his Lightsaber.  He deploys<br>
Bespin, and some stuff at the Downtown Plaza, two sites away.  I deploy<br>
Han and Chewie there and beat up all his stuff, and Chewie goes to the<br>
Bacta Tank.  I move everyone over to the central site.  He deploys more<br>
guys at the site with the POTF.  I deploy Chewie at the Downtown Plaza,<br>
and deploy a Swoop (Swoops on Cloud City, gotta love exterior sites).<br>
:-)  Han joins Chewie, and Ben with Saber and EPP Luke hop on the Swoop<br>
and go over to the site with POTF.  His guys run away, the Swoop follows<br>
them.  I don't bother SATMing any of his guys, cause he has 3 guys with<br>
3 ability each, so I can't get rid of his destiny draw.  I battle, he<br>
loses a lot, Ben revives Luke.  At Bespin, I deploy the Tantive and the<br>
Spiral, he responds with some Dreads and pilots.  I use Yoda to avoid<br>
having to lose either, and put some fodder aboard.  I'm killing Dreads<br>
to attrition, but he deploys the Executor.  It turns out I still have<br>
enough power (including destiny) to withstand, so that's pretty much<br>
stalemated.  I drain him out at his sites and win by 20.  FW+20, 4(+5)<br>
<br>
Highlights: I beat up lots of stuff. :-)<br>
Lowlights: There was no CC Occupation, Dark Deal, or CC Sabacc played,<br>
even though that seemed to be the theme of his deck...<br>
<br>
Game 6: My Dark vs. Jamie Beck's [1491] Tatooine (?) Deck<br>
<br>
Jamie was another unknown to me, and he was 3-2 so far for the day, so I<br>
was somewhat cautious.  He started Jabba's Palace and Careful<br>
Planning'ed for for the Audience Chamber.  He then proceeded to deploy<br>
lots and lots of Tatooine sites, I had no clue what he was going to do<br>
with that many Tatooine sites.  Anyway, I drop Vader and Tarkin at<br>
Jabba's Palace, and flip, noting he has no Force saved for Clashing and<br>
beating down Tarkin.  He does nothing but draw, I Monnok Used him.  I<br>
deploy Tempest 1 for Tarkin to hide on.  Again, he does nothing but<br>
draw, so I Monnok Used him again.  I get out Vader's Lightsaber, he<br>
Terminates my Visage, but I have another in my hand.  He drops EPP Obi,<br>
Chewbacca, and Farmboy down at the Audience Chamber.  I drain him for 3<br>
at Jabba's Palace, he drops Imperial Atrocity on me, I don't care.  I'm<br>
still somewhat cautious, so I throw my Visage and 2 5-destiny things to<br>
the Reactor Terminal.  I activate all but the 3 cards I Terminaled.  I<br>
deploy EPP Fett to give Tarkin some company, and Vader marches into the<br>
Audience Chamber.  Epic Circle on Obi, I play Focused Attack, and draw<br>
5,7,5.  He draws something less than that and loses Obi and 9.  During<br>
his activate phase, I Epic Obsession Farmboy too, draw my 5 and 7 again,<br>
Farmboy crosses and he loses 4.  He's left with Chewie there with no<br>
place to run, either face Father and Son in the AC or move outside and<br>
get beat upon by EPP Fett and Tarkin on Tempest 1.  He opts to stick<br>
around, I put my entire hand into the Terminal.  I battle Chewie, chop<br>
him with the Saber, and he loses like all but 1 Force, which he draws up<br>
on his turn, and I win by 39 (!).  FW+39, 6(+44)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Dueling, dueling, dueling... :-)<br>
Lowlights: I still don't know what the point of his deck is...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I finished out 10th, the highest amongst the 3-3 players, which<br>
wasn't too bad.  Chris Terwilliger got first, edging out Jon Schultz on<br>
differential.  As for teams, my team (which Bart later renamed 'Team<br>
Spanky-Monkey' or something :-)) finished in 4th out of the 6 teams. <br>
Team Twigg, consisting of 3 Terwilligers and a Talbot, was the best<br>
team, and Team Britney, consisting of Syracuse's finest, placed second. <br>
Anyway, Ted had awesome prize support, at least 4 packs for every player<br>
(and admission was only $5), I pulled a WB Han, which is nice I<br>
suppose.  Now I've got to figure out if my decks are worthy for D-con or<br>
not.  Dark did pretty good, winning 2 games with huge differential, and<br>
losing once against Woj by 4.  Light, on other other hand, did rather<br>
