Pretourny jank<br>
I drive 4 hours to get to Mike Merletto&amp;#8217;s house so I can bring a friend of mine, Mark Fessler, to a NC tournament.  So I get there around 10:20 or so and we get to playtesting.  I have this Agent capture style deck using lots of crazy stuff and happen to forget my light deck at home.  So after playtesting I have to whip up an whole new version of the RTP I was playing.  The basic tenets of the deck was podracing, lots of high destiny, Lost in the Wilderness, Surprise Assault, and Resilience.  We go up to where ever trinoc con was and pay 20 bucks to enter.  I scrub out of the first tourney held early in the day cos of some bad luck and forgetting to put in a few cards in the dark deck that last night(aka Fanfare).  So I&amp;#8217;m not to happy about Star Wars right then and brad and the group convince me to play in the second tournament.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Pairings are called(this is a team tourney) so I end up being matched against John Irving who had beat the deck I was playing against in the last tourny so I&amp;#8217;m like crap.  But then I remember that I exchanged the cards I needed to between tournys so I decide that I just need to play smart.<br>
My AOBS vs Jon&amp;#8217;s Jedi Council Mains<br>
I start IAO/SP, All Wrapped Up and Mob.  He Starts Staging Areas, SAC killer and I think the Insurrection combo.  First turn I pull Coruscant DB and a Vigo there and move Xixor over.  He activates then draws a few, he might have pulled a DB but I don&amp;#8217;t quite remember and I think that was his turn.  I activate like 7 pull the D* DB and move the group over there.  I put something down to look at the cards in my force pile and I draw a few.  Needless to say the game had its tourning point when I put out Fanfare early and captured Jedi Luke.  He ended up Revoing Coruscant to which I put ZiMH at the related DB and moved him up to drain for 1 a turn w/o scare.  The deck did what it was suppose to and I won by above ten but below 20 I think it was something like 13.<br>
2(+13 or so)<br>
Props to the deck for working and to John for Revoing Coruscant<br>
Slops to the meat cutter because he doesn&amp;#8217;t cut meat properly<br>
Game 2<br>
My RTP(aka the deck that should never win but does) vs some kids&amp;#8217; Rops<br>
He was playing trooper style, which I played forever in SC except that he had some cool stuff in his(like sandtroopers w/sandwhirl) in his that I didn&amp;#8217;t in mine.  I won the race like fourth turn because I got bad destinies(I usually win third turn fourth turn only if the opponent is racing too)  Needless to say 8d8 freed leia pretty early and she sat draining for 3(because he was flipped).  He set up Emperor Palpatine w/Overseeeing it Personally and Establish control at the dB and had troopers on either side.  So I decided to send Ben on the attack and he promptly killed off one side of the draining.  He drains w/ the Sandtroopers at the desert so I counterassault and draw 2 blind 6s and he loses like 10 because they&amp;#8217;re power 1 each.  Next turn I send Obi out again and I kill his group of 2 sandtroopers and move over to the Emperor&amp;#8217;s site.  He battles me and draws destiny to kill Obi(who has been resilienced every time so far) and resilience yet again.  We tie in power I think and I somehow miss the emperor.  He moves the emperor over to drain and I Lost in the Wilderness him next turn.  I drain him out.  Full win by 39.<br>
Props to Brad for winning and to the Team that Came in First Place<br>
Slops to me for not waiting to retrieve w/I did It so I could have a full win by 40<br>
<br>
Game 3 My AOBS vs Henry Jicha&amp;#8217;s LS Senate beats<br>
I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting to play henry ever since I&amp;#8217;ve been coming up to NC to play.  So I start the same as always IAO/SP, All Wrapped up and Mob He starts Insurrection/Aim High, Staging Areas and something else unimportant.  First turn I pull the D* DB and the Hutt prison(via Sonic Bombardment) and depoy the Coruscant dB from hand drop a Vigo there and move Xixor over.  He pulls the Spaceport DB (because he cant deploy his DB because it would be replacing my DB yeah technical but that&amp;#8217;s how it goes, this makes his celebration hard to do).  He draws a few.  I drop Iggy w/gun to the D* DB move Xixor&amp;#8217;s group over, put a virbo axe down to look at the cards in force pile and pick up Snoova and a Twilek and sit pretty saving 3 force to either set for stun or or to twilek.  He drops 2 senators to the chamber (palpatine and leiana Meridian or something like that) and.  I wait drain and make his lose 1 and draw a quite a few and save 3 force.  He drops yoda to the council chamber and honor and moves his to the spaceport DB.  At the end of his turn I twilek for No escape.  I activate out the butt compared to him and I drop No Escape and get something cool back(which I don&amp;#8217;t remember) and drop First Strike and Snoova for 2.  He&amp;#8217;s like I don&amp;#8217;t have a smuggler there, and I&amp;#8217;m like No Escape&amp;#8217;s a @#$% aint it and he quiets down. I pull an axe. I back up snoova w/another vigo and drop Guri there battle I axe Yoda I draw a 2 he draws a 5 and I still win cool.  I move everyone over to our favorite battle ground for insurance.  He drops Master Q to the DB to drain and we swap drains for a turn to which he deploys Jedi Luke to the DB too(both the Master and Luke have their sabers now so I don&amp;#8217;t like going up against them). Last turn I drew a bunch though so I&amp;#8217;m holding 2 hidden weapons(wortheless w/o boba or jodo) dengar w/gun, a Thermal detonator, Grotto Werribbi(or whatever his name is), stunning leader and a few other things that don&amp;#8217;t quite matter.  So I drop Grotto to the Spaceport dB for free(hey cool No Escape really sucks for LS doesn&amp;#8217;t it) and move him over to the Jedi Council to drain so I can get ahead in the drain race(stupid me forgets that honor will make me suck).  So he drops Obiw/stick down to battle Grotto and he expects a barrier but I&amp;#8217;m like He&amp;#8217;s there.  So he battles he retrieves 1 which he pays for and I lose 1.  I as a just action exclude all characters w/ability &gt;2.  Which would be everyone so the battle ends, sucks to be him hunh(I call stunning leader the new barrier cos it cant be canceled).  So he expects the beatdown and moves Ben to be &amp;#8216;safe&amp;#8217; w/his mentor and his trainee.  I&amp;#8217;m like watch this.  I activate pull a DB and notice that the last 4 destinies in my deck are a 4, a 1, a 2 and a 6.  I drop Dengar to the DB for 2 hoping not to get barriered and he&amp;#8217;s like he&amp;#8217;s okay he can&amp;#8217;t hit me.  I drop the Thermal detonator on him for 3(cos I forgot about no escape).  He&amp;#8217;s like whatever.  I&amp;#8217;m just hoping he doesn&amp;#8217;t have a weapon lev(but if he does I have a ghhk combo for something purpose right). I battle and forget about First Strike and throw the detonator, first destiny is a 6, and I&amp;#8217;m like boom baby bye bye Jedi Luke, the second destiny was a 1 so I&amp;#8217;m like damn this thing really does blow stuff up and the third destiny was a 2 so I&amp;#8217;m like stupid suicide bombers they just destroy themselves instead of getting their bounty.  OH well I made 3 big mains immediately lost.  He sits there as asks to see the Detonator.  I gladly oblige as he puts all his characters in the lost pile.  I move Grotto over and back him up and move some ppl over the Mos espa DB to drain.  So the rest of the game goes like this I drain for 7 and make him lose 1 to the objective and he drains me for 1 all the while I&amp;#8217;m trying to put cards down like a mad man to raise my differential.  So I win by 16<br>
So far I&amp;#8217;m 6(+69) pretty cool eh.<br>
Props to the Denonator for blowing things up(like brad&amp;#8217;s mom), to my deck for working<br>
Slops to the Jedi for not sensing a big boom, to mike and mark for NOT KEEPING IT CLOSE<br>
<br>
Because myself and Brad are the only 2 undefeated players so far we have to play each other even though we&amp;#8217;re on the same team.  Suck.  And Because I have UBER differential as compared to him I have to play light, suck again.  Then I realize that WYS kicks my @$$ badly and am kinda happy for the way it played out.<br>
My RTP VS Brad&amp;#8217;s HD beats<br>
I start pod prep and Echo Base Garrison and he starts IAO/SP, Mob and something that had no effect on the game.  He activates and I pull I did it! He drops Ozzel and Lord Vader to the Executor DB and Transits Vader to the CC db which he pulled via IAO, and tells me to lose one.  I lose AFA off the top and I&amp;#8217;m like suck.  Anyways I deploy Corran to Ozzel&amp;#8217;s location and battle I draw a 5 which isnt enough to break his forfeit so he just loses ozzel and I move Corran over to cancel visage.  He activates and tells me how much of a jerk I am to kill of ozzel and then drops Janus and P59 to Corran&amp;#8217;s location he battles I draw another 5 and start the race finally when I remember to and I just lose corran because I To Close for Comforted P59&amp;#8217;s shot and he loses Janus before he can use him so I&amp;#8217;m like no more Visage, ever.  He sits and waits.  I drop Obiwan w/stick to Vader&amp;#8217;s location and cut him and draw and obi leaves being very resilient.  I draw race destiny and its like a 3 and a 1(Lando w/ axe).  He drops Vader back to the CC Docking bay and moves P59 over to the Executor DB.  I drop Obi again and cut Vader and he dies horribly and I make Obi Resilient.  So here&amp;#8217;s how the game goes I forget about AFA which pops (the mofo of has to pull out the  @$$ player tech not lose any because I didn&amp;#8217;t call him on it).  I kill of P59 via Jar Jar.  I kill most of his characters while begging for a surprise assault.  He has Iggy w/gun sitting alone I have to Luke at 1 db so I can retrieve next turn because my biatch deploys CHYBC and I cant deploy and pay to retrieve in 1 turn.  And Obi at the other.  He tries to sniper Obi so I Swing and a Miss to cancel dark strike.  Sucks to play combos hunh.  He battles and we both know he has a tracked 6 on top to capture Obi.  I have a dodge in my hand and forget that it can subtract 3 from weapon destiny so I play it and try to take it back but he pulls out the I&amp;#8217;m a B@ST@Rd tech so I cant take it back and make him lose overflow cos the 6 was his only destiny.  He just ends up outlasting me because I made 4 mistakes.  The Dodge being misplayed, playing losing track to put I have you now back on top, playing losing track to put Vader back on top(because he deploy vader 7 times in the game and he only has 5 in the deck) and because of one last mistake that I forgot that cost me the game.  Needless to say brad Reinhold won because he played smarter than I did.  I made key mistakes which he capitalized on.  My deck should have won but I failed it.  Ps if you wan the jank $hit of the deck dmail me I&amp;#8217;d be glad to give it to you, it never ever ever comes near to losing a race(except when I don&amp;#8217;t get any racing interrupts whatsoever, it&amp;#8217;s a long story that I&amp;#8217;d rather not go over again).  Brad wins by 10 (which should be 8 because he never lost to AFA, which would have been close to the difference that me dodging Iggy&amp;#8217;s shot and cutting him and drawing a tracked 6 for destiny would have been).  Oh well live and learn and beat Brad another day.<br>
Props to no one because I suck<br>
Slops to me for forgetting what Dodge does, to Brad for letting me play interrupts w/o force when Battle Order is out, for letting me play Resilience when he had it grabbed when I couldn&amp;#8217;t pay for it, for making lots of scrub mistakes when he&amp;#8217;s a high 1900 player<br>
<br>
Brad wins<br>
Henry Jicha gets second because of just a barely higher differential<br>
I get third and get a Masterfull move foil(brad&amp;#8217;s tourny support from his own collection)<br>
<br>
The Team that came in first place was the team that came in first place(sounds crazy but that way my team we had Brad, Mike Merletto, Mark Fessler and Myself) <br>
Second was Jicha&amp;#8217;s team and third was the last team<br>
<br>
Prop:<br>
To Mark for coming up w/me<br>
To Mike for playing and for putting up a house for us to sleep in<br>
To Brad for playtesting w/us<br>
To Don Weinstein and Patrick Hines for being awesome<br>
To the dude who showed the Team that Came in First place how to play LotR<br>

To brad for being a jerk and not letting me take an action back<br>
To brad for being stupid and letting me play cards that I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to play<br>
To brad for playing decks that I want to play<br>
To Brad for playing solid decks(who needs to keep there rating)<br>
<br>
Super PROPS:<br>
