Also, the prizes would include the promotional foils signal and imp. decree so i knew if i got either i would be getting some instant money. I was confident that i would get at least 2nd because the only very good person that was supposed to come was Steve Baroni. <br>
      The night before I play some basketball with some friends and then rest up for a paintball game i was playing in at 9:30. In this time I changed my hidden base deck from using matching ships and pilots to using regular power ships( home 1, liberty, spiral, and falcon)  and put in the cc db and some off the edges.  I also took out battle plan and a siganl for some reason( would cost me later) . <br>
      Anyways, the paintball game sucked. The lights we brought to our makeshift field didn&#146;t do much so all you could do is  shoot where you saw a moving shadow or where someone gave away their position. It was me, Peter &quot;ChevinUSMC&quot; Harrington, and an ex-star wars player by the name of John Southcot agaist 3 other kids I knew.We had 1 guy reffing. Pete took out their best guy, then he got shot, then a kid on the other team had to go home because his girlfriend has him whipped and he had to talk to her online. It was 2 on 1 and I ambushed their last player. I didnt even hit him I was so far away but I shot him so he ran right into barrel of Southcot. That is tech. Our team won.<br>
      Go home later around 11:00 and make some final changes on my decks.They seem ok so I go to sleep. I wake up late the next morning and have to rush like mad to get ready in time. My mom is driving me and we pick up Peter Harrington and Ryan Driscoll and get to TJ&#146;s Collectibles on time. I am surprised to see that Hayes Hunter showed up and he decided to participate int the tourney. Baroni, Michael Hawley, Stephen Celluci, and State Champs Paul Maholic(RI) and Brian Ciezinski(New Hampshire) are the other notables.I talk with Mike Pistone for awhile and the tournament gets started around 12:30.My rating going into the tournament is 2024.<br>
<br>
Game 1 My light vs Jared Greenwalds (1391) MKOS abyssan swarm<br>
<br>
I know what to expect this game because I saw the deck he posted and I knew how to beat it. I set up some guys at my h1 db and get out my systems. He sets up the chamber and his aliens. I get out my generic db and put my lando w/ax there and move my twass and melas over there. I am protected by a barrier and a fallen portal. I draw up a jedi luke, his saber, ounee tah, and obi w/saber . I play a throw anther charge but he grabs it.I take his drain of 1 and during my turn i draw and save force .  He then plays gallid and puts some scubs at the palace and the lower quarters. I deploy my harc seff and  obi with saber to the generic db and luke with saber to h1 db. I also deploy mantellian savrip. I move luke over to the generic db and move harc, obi, lando, melas, and twass to the palace, saving 2 force to cancel his drain and 1 force for fallen portal and/or barrier. ,I take his drain of 4 and he then deploys his myo to the chamber and 5 abyssans with 4-lom to the palace. He doesn&#146;t battle but he moves over xizor and boelo.I deploy corran horn and he is not none shall passed. I battle thinking i can&#146;t lose with clash and sorry about the mess combo card and savrip fodder but i am wrong. I think he played jabbas twerps to get 3 abyssans from reserve deck and then my weapon destinies all miss. He gets a 5 (7 since it is flipped ad bib and jabba are on table) and i get a 1 or 2 which he cancels with boelo. I have bad power compared to his 40 something. A falcon and jedi luke to the savrip take care of the pain and i might have lost melas as well.I move over jedi luke to help out. Anyways. We battle like mad with me savriping the damage and him retriving his losses.This game took very long because I kept retrieving my lost savri[p cards with on the edgews and he retrieved 13 with jabbas twerps and abyssan ornament. I get some more scrubs and I finally start to track some good destinies and start killing his guys permanently. OTE is deployed and I kill his stinger and bosk at my corulag with liberty, wedge, ad a tracked 6.Harc seff is cancelling his drains and he finally is unprpared in a battle. I hit about all of his guys and draw mad destinies. He loses some battle damage and most of the guys off his sites and i finally drain him out.<br>
Full win<br>
2(+22)<br>
<br>
Game 2 My dark side deck vs Brian Ciezinski(1740s)Profit mains.<br>
<br>
I started with mara and xizor at the chamber and since i couldn&#146;t find the d* db in my reserve deck I couldn&#146;t deploy vader. I deployed mara&#146;s saber and emperor to the executor db instead. He didn&#146;t do much , just saved up force. I knew a large force was coming so I played a guri to the palace and moved over mara and xizor there. He did have a decent force, ben, his saber, leia w/gun and chewie protector. He battles but I steal ben&#146;s saber with a weapon levitation. I hit his leai with gun ad my destiny is a 5. His is a 5 too. He revives leia and moves away to free han. I finally set up a lord and saber to my d* db and a zuckus in hunter to carida. Battle order goes out and i know i&#146;ve won. Still though, he has a lifee lead on me sice he retrieved 10 force and i have about 6 still in my pile.It becomes really close when he plays a jedi luke and saber to back door. I can&#146;t stop that and i think he has a portal so instead of fighting him , i use my admirals and iggy to move to his chief chirpa&#146;s hut for an unstoppable drain of 2. I am draining for 6-8 a turn but I am losing 6 a turn. When he is weak on force I move over my guys to block his drain and pull off a small but solid win.<br>
Full Win by 8<br>
4(+30)<br>
<br>
That game was much closer then i thought it would be and makes me take into consideration making a profit deck for light side.<br>
<br>
Game 3, My dark vs Johnny Rivera (1548) QMC Avatar style<br>
<br>
I know that I can beat this deck easily because all you have to do is take over bespin and get off battle order. He already starts battle plan so I&#146;m halfway there. I set up vader second turn at the d* db protected be a PASOA and zuckus in hunter goes to his bespin. I draw and get the stinger/guri combo.He takes a few turns of visage damge. He deploys some guys to 2 of his besping sites that are protected by dodge or path probably and wedge and ship go to his Cloud City. I enforce bespin with bosk in ship and give vader his saber. He pays for a drain and then deploys falcon, captain han, and an intruder missile to carida putting menace fades and battle plan to work for him. I planned for this move and it doesn&#146;t really effect me because stinger and zuckus have hyperspeed of 5. I know he has a power pivot in hand but he can&#146;t hit a star destroyer so i deploy avenger, chiraneau and thrawn. I lateral damage falcon and he pwer pivots me in battle. The difference is that i draw a 9 total to his 4 or 5. He loses falcon and i lose chiraneau. I move over stinger to help out the avenger.<br>
Battle plan is against him now and he pays for his drains of 1. He deploys to my executor to drain for 2 but I take care of that with a xizor, mara and saber and a well played PASOA. I drain him out. <br>
Full Win by 18<br>
6(+48)<br>
<br>
I think I am going to play hayes or baroni but I play Rivera again.<br>
<br>
Game 4 My light vs Johnny Rivera(1548) Decktech trooper deck(I think Cowboys from hell, that couild be way off)<br>
<br>
Not much to this game. I played bad and my deck did not have this in mind when I was thinking of what i would face.He quickly got out the suba/tactical recall combo and got out about 10 good unique troopers for free. He spread them out and flipped the objective. By the time I had a strong force at a battleground db he was draining me for 6 a turn. I regretted very much taking out battle plan and signal because i couldn&#146; get out ote. I had to fallen portal fenson but eithout OTE he just ran away. I couldn&#146;t follow half the time from full scale alert so the drains were not prevented. I got off menace fades for a few turns but then his bosk with forfeit fodder blocked up carida. I didn&#146;t have enough force to deploy my h1 so it took me a few turns to kill bosk in ship. I had the game a little more under control but it was way too late and i had no catch up retrieval thanks to fenson. I figure I wil draw up because he had a few cards in hand .<br>
full Loss by around 12<br>
<br>
6(+36)<br>
<br>
Bye Bye 32 Ratings Points!<br>
<br>
Game 5 My light vs Stephen Celluci (1685) Hunt Down Dueling.<br>
<br>
I had no dueling protection so i was nervous about playing against this deck. I played this one bad too putting obi down way too early and putting weak backup with him. The backup was battled leaving only twass and a disarmed obiwan. He dueled obiwan with focused attack, a lightsaber, and incredibly high tracked destiny. My total was 11 to his 29 or something amazing. Then twass got destroyed leaving me with a loss of 18 force that turn total. Visage worn down any chance of a comeback and i curled up and died. Game over.<br>
Full Loss by 20<br>
6(+16)<br>
<br>
Bye Bye another 32 ratings points!!! Now I&#146;m definatelly back in the 1900s.I find out I am playing  Celluci again. I wish i was facing baroni so i could get some ratings points back. <br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6, My dark vs Stephen Celluci(1685) X-wing swarm hidden base.<br>
<br>
I know I can beat this no problem but the game was much more complex then it should have been. I played like @#$%  and Steve played well despite some bad luck. I get vader and saber to the d* db like 4th turn because i have to twileck for no escape(he did insight and honor) and because i had bad luck finding my d*db from reserve deck. I forget to make him lose to visage about 2-3 times per game which is always a bad sign. I get good stuff to space and my force generation was huge from him playing coruscant, kessel, and kiffex. I get out battle plan with my star destroyers and independant ships. He drains for 1 and i am draining and visaging him for 5 a turn. He rebel fleets and cancels a few with the objective until i probe his sysem. He retrieves 10 force from all wings report in but I am as strong in space as he is so he can&#146;t drain for much. He missed hitting my stinger and guri eith an xwing cannon in a battle and he ha no force to fly away. I get him in the biggest battle where he had 6 power and i had 40 somethin. He played what i feared, houjix combo card. I wish i hadn&#146;t taken out my first strike but I still have the game. I jsut block his drains in space and drain/visage on the ground so he can&#146;t do much. It would have been so much easier if i got my battle deployment out. I win the game but it takes about 45 minutes.<br>
Full Win by 24<br>
8(+40)<br>
<br>
I actually take 3rd behind baroni and Hayes but I lose about 45 or 50 ratings points from the tournament. I don&#146;t get the foils either but I get 2 packs of R2 and 3 packs of DSII. I pull decent stuff including a lord vader, a foiled trample, chewie protector and a japanese rebel barrier. These are some final standings.<br>
<br>
1. Hayes Hunter 12(+100+)<br>
2. Steve Baroni 8(+more than +40)<br>
3. Michael Schiemer 8(+40)<br>
4. Steve Celluci or Johnny Rivera( I think, with 8(+low diffs)<br>
<br>
Mike Pistone went 3-3 from playing Hayes twice and from losing to Riveras trooper deck. Ryan Driscoll went 1-5 only beating Peter Harrington. Peter Harrington went 2-4 including a true tie timed win against Michael Hawley. He won because of the cards Michael Hawley OOCed.<br>
<br>
