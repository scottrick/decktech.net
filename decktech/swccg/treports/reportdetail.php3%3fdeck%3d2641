<br>
Pre-Tourney<br>
<br>
Comic-Con is right around the corner and this is the last tourney before the big weeknd arrives.  Ive Been Preparing for this for sometime now getting decks ready for Con and testing with the crew.  Last week Kevin Shannon got back from the marines and is ready 2 play this weekend so Im really excited about playing this weekend.  During the week I was on a search for a DS deck.  I already had a killer LS deck that me and Paul McKelvey have been playing and only has 1 loss between us in 4 tourneys.  I have the crew over and we playtest for a while and talk tech as I try to come up with a good dark side deck.  I had the Hunt Down Ive been playing with commands that was a good deck but I wanted something different.  So I see the new Brangus deck that was up and I decide that deck isnt so good.  After fiddling around with decks and talking to Alfred online, I stick with the same deck and tuning for different decks types.  On Friday everyone comes over and we play a few games getting ready for tomorrow.  Chris Green had put together Paul and my WYS racer deck but in the end he cant play it.  So on friday night we scramble 2 come up with something good and he ends up playing his old(crappy) HB mains deck.  Everyone leaves around 1 and I go to sleep.  I wake up around 7(tourney at 12) and I mess with my LS some adding a Begger to Beg away force if they want 2 lose 2 to keep theyre force there from I did it.  Also a few other things that will make the day easier.  Paul comes and picks me up around 9:45(right in the middle of X-Men Evolution) and were off.  On the way there for some odd reason we come 2 almost a compleate stop in Tracy(smells like s-h-it there) for some stupid reason and then we start up again like 2 mins later.  WTF we think it was(dykes on bikes day in frisco).  We arrive and the tourney starts.<br>
<br>
LS:  WYS Podracing Unstoppable<br>
DS:  Hunt Down Sucks<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs K Howards Ties wakumiu start with Maul Effect<br>
<br>
This game is preety uneventful cept for some force drains and like 2 battles.  He pulls out Kuat while I sac insights to get Sqadron Assign.  He plays Sebulba and flashes me on the first turn and drops the Maul Landing Site and draws the rest.  I go for the fast drains dropping Wedge and ship to Kessel.  He activates pulls Trace is correct and Zuckuss 2 fight off Wedge dropping a lateral on Tatooine.  He draws low but I have to lose Wedge.  On my turn I play Dash in Outrider and Melas to satisify for Zuckuss.  I battle with Draw their fire subract his power and draw a 4.  He loses Zuckuss and like 7.  He drops Boba in Ship to Tatooine and Maul with Saber to the Landing site for some big drains.  I drain him for some and drop Luke and Lando into the Cantina flipping.  I win the race on his turn with him hitting me for 5 on that turn(ouch).  He Play yavin and a Sith Probe droid retrieving 1.  Sienar Fleet Systems and a few ties retrieving 2 more.  I drain him for 5 get I did it going while he moves maul to the docking Bay.  His drains are eating a way at me.  He draws up more and has no force pile moving Maul and Droid into the Cantina.  I drop Han, Artoo Threepio and Wedge(retrived) and battle.  I chop Maul.  He trys to hack I play Too Close for confort.  I shop the Sith Droid, play no battle destiny.  Draw 3 destiny.  He loses both and like 13.  I drain him out in a few turns.  FW(+17)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Deck is a Machine<br>
Lows:  Couldve been alot more<br>
<br>
After this game I walk outside a little.  I go back in and watch Kevin playing against Steve.  He finishes and we go next door to the asian deli and he buys a sandwich.  Kevin is a total people person.  Hes talking to the owner about her kids and slang.  Man that was crazy.  After that Alfred and his crew pull up but since theyre late they take a auto loss which kinda sucks.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Alfred Dongs Slave Quaters Harvest<br>
<br>
Well crap.  2nd game and I already get to play Alfred.  Oh well.  I start off with a good hand but it really wont matter.  We lose some force to visage as he starts the Threepio Engine up with How did we get into this mess.  I drop Vader to tat dbay on 2nd turn and he loses a 1.  He kills off vader this turn and trys to OOC him but I cancel it with This is some Rescue.  I get Emp to the Tat Dbay this time for activation.  He trys to tt but i cancel it with Holonet transmission.  He drops Owen Beru and Harvests some of the lost stuff back.  I drop Choke Vader there and battle with first strike.  I choke Owen Beru and I draw a 6 to kill them both.  He plays Quigon against Vader and I kill him and a few.  Vader dies.  Beru comes back.  He harvest Quigon back and plays Him there.  I battle with Maul and weapon lev his stick and make him lose like 2 more.  Next turn he kills Maul off and i forget to put his stick in my lost pile(mistake)  We have a few ground battles with Obi and Luke agaist Emp and Janus but he misses both hacks and I kill 1 of them.  Corran goes to the Holotheatre 2 Cancel Visage.  I get battle order and Chimera 2 Carida for Lockdown.  I play Mara and Stick against Corran and he loses him and 2 or so.  By about now I dont have much left 2 do and he doesnt either.  We get down 2 like 6 a piece and he gets me with his ground drains.  FL(-4)  <br>
<br>
Highs:  Great Game with Alfred even though I lost<br>
Lows:  I beat this same deck like last week.  <br>
<br>
Game3<br>
LS vs Chris Greens MKOS<br>
<br>
Great game 3 and playing Car already.  We start off podracing and him saying I should forfeit because he can beat me by like 40 so I should just take the loss of 30.  He doesnt do anything on the first turn.  I sac insights for squadron assign and Dash goes to Kessl for fast drains.  We race. Bib and Boelo goes to the ac and drops Den of thieves.  I drain but he cancels.  I get Mirax to Tatooine Flipping.  I draw up some setting up the beats.  He drops a whole bunch of aliens to the Ac and draws up more.  I drain but he cancels and I set up in the Cantina with Luke, threepio and Han.  Draw more.  I win the race as he drops Xizor and 3 Abyssians 2 Lower Passageways.  He loses some and gets them back with Jabbas Twerps.  I drain but he cancels the 3 again.  I play Nabrun for the kill but he grabs it and cancels it with Ghhk combo.  I get I did it going for some no force pile action.  He doesnt drain and drops Zuckuss and 4-lom to space against Mirax which i barrier Zuckuss.  I drain him for some.  Play Wedge in Red Squad 1 with x-wing Lasers.  Battle with Draw Their Fire Shot and blow up Zuckuss.  I spead with Lando and Theron to the Docking Bay.  He has Sail Barge there already.  He drops Iggy with Riot and 2 abyssians.  He battles and retrieves 3 with scum and i its a trap it.  I play Chewie and Talon and battle.  I run Luke Run and Clash of Sabers and shot both abyssians and draw 2 destiny and thats game.  FW(+14)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning i guess<br>
Lows:  Car member<br>
<br>
This is when our Lunch Break is.  I head off to Taco Bell with Brad and Bobby Garcia.  I get a chaco taco(if you dont eat 1 at lunch break you lose your next 3 games).  I eat it as i watch Brad eat 6 soft tacos(6!!!) if i ever at 6 i would probably explode.  We talk a while as Bobby tells us how he beat Dan Mochizuki.  Then the killer ewoks come up.  For those of you who dont know, Brad plays ewoks with There is good in him.  It has killer drains and power.  We head back and the round starts up.  <br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
DS vs Alex Sheynis Slave Quaters City Outskits<br>
<br>
This game was pathetic.  I get set up on the Second Turn with Vader and Stick to Docking Bay him losing some from Visage.  He gets Ben Kenobi to City outskits with his saber.  I drain.  We lose a few from Visage.  Luke Comes down against Vader.  Swing 1, 1.  I swing back... 4, 1.  Great!!.  Destiny.  He draws a Site and I draw a 1.  At least i killed off luke.  He then loses a 6 off the top to Visage.  His drains are getting big with Obi and Qui with sticks at outskirts.  I move vader over and he battles me.  I hit nobody.  He misses vader twice.  But i end up loseing vader and he revies Qui-gon Losing the stick.  Were both Half dead by then.   Emperor and Janus go to dbay as we move our guys around.  I kill off His threepio Machine with Mara.  Im almost dead by now and so is he.  We have a few more battles and I have Mara in the Cantina after vader ate it 2 luke and Orrimarrko.  Heres what the board looks like.  Mara in the Cantina against Orrimaarko.  Emp and Janus against Qui and his stick.  I only have 2 force activated so i cant really do anything moving wise.  I end up battling Orrimarko.  I get 1 back from first strike and draw my tracked 6.  He draws a 2.  So its 12 to 6.  He loses Orrimarko and 2 and we both lose 1 to visage.  FW(+2)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Awsome game with Alex.  Made me think to hard though.<br>
Lows:  Only 2.  Oh well<br>
<br>
We play again after and he beats the crap out me.  After that I do some trading with this new guy named Albert.  I look and see Brummel has a Mexican Pizza.  I ask him if i give him Lord Vader if he will give me Mexican Pizza.  He says sure.  So I take it and eat it.  Alfred comes over and makes fun of me about all these jokes bout Vaders and soda and everything.  Brummel goes away and I talk with Sheynis and Albert.  Brummel comes back and says he needed that mexican pizza cause hes hella hungry now.  So I laugh at him for a while.  Off 2 game 5 and guess who I play.<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs Eric Brummels Hunt Down Racing<br>
<br>
HAHAHA.  I get to get revenge for my Lord Vader.  As were laying out our starting he doesnt want to start Wattos Box cause if he loses it will be bad.  So Gibson Yims next to him asking him Wheres the box Eric.  Play the Box.  Then I get into it and call him a girl.  Gibsons over there laughing his @$$ off because of that.  So we start and he flashes me and draws a 2+3.  He draws up some as i cancel Visage with TT.  I get Dash to Kessel early again and drain for 3 rest of the game.  We race again and he draws a 1 this time.  I draw high enough to be behind him by 1.  He drops vader with stick to DownTown Plaza and flips.  Plays No Escape getting Vsage back and playing it.  I lose from Visage and drain him for 3.  I send in Luke to Cantina and Wedge to Tatooine.  Flipping.  He races and draws a 1 again and i Win the race.  He sits there for about 5 mins thinking.  He finally deploys Iggy to Cantina and caps Luke.  I TT the Visage out of play.  He loses his 6 and i get mine back.  I get drains going and set up I did it.  I drop Artoo Threepio, Melas, and Lando.  Battle with Draw their fire.  I shot miss.  He doesnt draw casue i play No destiny card.  I get my Luke back.  After that i drain him for some.  Retrieve with I did it.  He drains for some.  I drain him out in a few turns.  FW(+30)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Thats what you call Revenge for Lord Vader<br>
Lows:  I didnt get to play on the Edge to get even more back..  Shucks.<br>
<br>
After that game we get ready to start and all the parings are screwed up so instead of playing easy matchup Andre Kornell i get hard matchup against Phillip Greens Training Racing... CRAP!<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
DS vs Phillip Greens Podracing Training<br>
<br>
Great final game of the day and Im gonna have to think.  Well he starts the racing goods with honor as his starting effect.  I get Carida and activate.  I flash him and race drawing a 4+3.  I decide to draw up.  I get No escape and Vaders Stick in that draw.  So I lose my 1 to visage and he goes.  He gets a few sites and drops Daughter to Training Area getting a test.  I lose 1 to Visage.  We Race.  He draws really low and I get another 7.  I drop Vader and His saber to Tat Dbay flipping and playing No Escape.  He loses from Visage.  I set up my hand some.  He gets out Yoda with a test and Lukes backpack.  I drain him for a few while we race and i draw a 5+3 this time.  Phillip plays step backwards on me and him so i put back my 5.  I get Maul and his Saber to D* Dbay for more drains.  He attempts test 1 and MISSES!!  What more luck can I have.  He gets more of his sites out and another Jedi Test, and pops in a Anger Fear Agression.  I activate so It doesnt come up thank god.  We draw hes at about 19 and Im bout 20 or so.  I drain for 4 and get Chimera with a pilot to Carida.  He gets his test this time and sets up for Test 2.  I move it so he cant get way of things going.  He wins the Race on this turn and i drain him for 3.  It goes like that for a while.  He starts running low on force so he attacks me with Obi vs Vader with Stick.  He hacks.  I let him kill me and i dont draw destiny.  I lose 1 from Visage and so does he.  I drop Mara with Saber tracking the right destinys so Im gonna get some breakthough.  I play First Strike and battle.  I get 2 back he loses 2.  I chop Obi and he Chops Mara.  I draw high he draws a 4 he takes 3 breakthrough.  After that I drop Vader to flip and he has no more answers.  FW(+15)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning against a non interactive deck<br>
Lows:  Not Much<br>
<br>
Well I end up in 3rd Behind Nghia Nguyen and Kevin who comes back from Marines and Wins.  Go Kevin.  I get Threepio with his parts showing in my packs.  After the tourny I played my WYS against Nick Stefankos &quot;White Rabit&quot; which was supposely GOD or something like that.  I beat the crap outa him with very little fight.  We head home and have our post-tourney stop at In-and-Out Burger which is always great.<br>
<br>
