Welcome to the Brahma Bulls grill, where the only dishes are served cold and the only thing on the menu starts with &quot;Can of&quot; and ends with &quot;whoop @$$&quot;......tournament report this week from TWO tournaments, back to back, head to head, from Los Gatos and San Jose, courtesy of Collector's Corner and Comics and Fantasies......TR happens NOW.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enter the week before......lve talked to my friend, Steve Daniel, a few weeks in advanced about this, a double tourney in the area of San Jose. After considering it, I thought I'd have one more go at tournaments before school totally ran over my schedule.....and ending it with a double tourney is even better....<br>
<br>
So now it was the matter of decks. Talking to Kevin Shannon, youd think LS was over. I was pretty optimistic of my Throne Room deck, same one I played last week, but I was too stuck on myself to make certain changes I shouldve made.......nevertheless, its a good deck. DS was once again easy......BHBM. Theres no DS Im more comfortable with now, and it had a 12-0 record on it, so there was no reason not to add 4 more games to it. <br>
<br>
Steve and his friend Dave Kemner hits my house and stays for the night, and Steve, dumb as always, forgets his LS, so I have to make him a deck, he says &quot;training looks good&quot; so thats all said and done and playtest a few before heading off to sleep. We head out the next day, exhausted as always(I LOVE THIS GAME). So we make it there early, and Im saying sleep deprivation is getting to me and I dont want to play. We head to Safeway and buy possibly the worst donuts in the world, and I start to wake up, so I play in the first tournament with 2 hours of sleep and bad donuts keeping me up.......it doesnt matter.......LETS ROCK.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS vs. It Doesnt Matter what his name is.......DS Rendili Stardrives<br>
<br>
I forgot his name, but Steve said he was a beginner, and it showed. He starts off on Rendili, and drops Kashyyk and Kiffex early. I get alot of TWIX sites in my hand so I drop and wait.....he drops Dominator to Rendili with a pilot and drops Rendili Stardrives......my cue. I wipe him off with Capn Han and Billy Dee on the Falcon, and Tycho on Green Squad 3......he loses everything, I Alter the Stardrive and move to Kiffex for drains. He drops Executor, I barrier.....he reinforces with a pilot. I battle, he loses the pilot......He drops Devastator and battles, I kill Devastator with no battle damage for me. He sits on Kiffex refusing to let me drain, but taking battle damage up the yang, which is also fine by me. He sits there too long, and I win by 32.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+32)<br>
Highs: Winning and getting off to a good start<br>
Lows: Nothing much.....beating a scrub but thats about it....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: DS vs. Jeff Field's Speed MWYHL<br>
<br>
Ack......the one deck I was hoping not to see was here in front of me. I wasnt about to give up though, so I started off with Emporer to the Endor Dbay and drop Janus next turn......Jeff drops Yoda and waits. I drain and set up a Dbay at Rendili and set up with Vader next to the Emporer, and hit the system with Flagship and Admiral Piett. He gives me Luke, and I make the mistake of playing Force Lightning too fast, just to kill him, and have him deploy it from Lost Pile on the same turn. I get Sim out, and drop Chiraneau to the Rendili Dbay to satisfy Honor, and move down to the Throne Room and duel. He plays Projection, but his spies get Trampled, and duel damage is getting to him. Im starting to wonder why he hasnt done Test 1 yet, turns out he drew DOS opening hand. He eventually gets Traffic, but an Alter later thats not working anymore. He finally gets DOS out really late game, but at this point, its too late to start training again. I duel him out. Win by 18.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+50)<br>
Highs: Playing Jeff Field, and a good game....<br>
Lows: Drawing DOS opening hand has GOT to suck....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS vs. Kevin Shannons DS BHBM Imperial Overkill<br>
<br>
I finally get a piece of the Comic Con champ, and it was one for the ages. He gets Emporer to Yavin early, and we stay there all game long. Emporer's backup and some squads(no Vader) hits Yavin and I decide to make use of BHBM and drop Luke to off them. No luck with bad destinies, and all of a sudden Kevin has 2 stacked on Insignificant Rebellion. Honor halts a few drains, and Vader eventually makes it to Luke. He makes it back, and Im winning duels, so no loss for me. I kill off a mass majority of his characters thanks to hit and run squads, but suffer a few more stacked cards to Insignificant Rebellion. He takes Mara and Igar to Rendili's Dbay, and drops Chiraneau on Chimaera to the system as well. I respond with Super Falcon and Wedge, and I knock off the Admiral thanks to Imperial Command. He responds with Devastator, and now thats 5 to Insignificant. He drops Kiffex and runs, and I off the Chimaera next turn thanks to OTE, and kill off a few more Imps at Yavin and fulfill Battle Plan. He has 5 cards left, but should he duel and lose, he'd win the game, but should he duel and win, he'd lose next turn to my drain of 4. He doesnt activate, duels, and he loses......and so do I. Loss by 5.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+45)<br>
Highs: Having an awesome game with Kevin, and playing one for the ages<br>
Lows: Losing, I guess, but I dont really care.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4: DS vs. Trevor's LS MBO Breakdown<br>
<br>
Trevor tells me off the bat his LS isnt what he expected, and he hasnt been doing so well with it, so Im expecting an easy game. Emporer comes down first turn to the DS2 Dbay, and transits over to Yavin next turn. He grabs the War Room, and tries to take out the Emporer with EPP Leia and Tawss....end result, he ends up killing Tawss and running to the Jungle with Leia. I drop Janus and Sim to Palpatine as he drops Capn Han to Yavin and shuttles Leia up. I drop Vader to Rendili, Luke comes out next turn. He drops Kessel and shuffles over with the Falcon......I drop Flagship, Piett and Bossk, Lateral and battle, he draws three, all 2's, and I draw double 6's(I LOVE Janus). Piett dies off, he loses everything plus about 15 more, and I dominate the rest of the way with drains at Yavin, Rendili, and Kessel. Win by 26.<br>
<br>
Final Score: 6(+71)<br>
Highs: Finishing strong, DS still undefeated<br>
Lows: Nothing much, tired<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Heres the top 4.....<br>
<br>
Winner: Kevin Shannon<br>
2nd: Steve Daniels<br>
3rd: Brandon Bale<br>
4th: Alfred Dong<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats the end of half the games, I get 2 packs of DS2 for prizes, nothing spectacular, but I traded for an AO I needed which was cool. Im about ready to pass out, but theres 4 more games at San Jose. Im starving for food, but Steve is sitting there with his training deck playing Paul Feldman, so I have to sit painfully and watch. <br>
<br>
After Steve FINALLY wins the game, we head out to find something to eat, and stop off at Jack in the Crack to do so. We share war stories, and I find out Dave got a Jedi Luke for his trouble. We take off for Comics and Fantasies, and Steve decides to forget his trip home for some stuff. <br>
<br>
We get to the store and half the people left.......but a few more show up, so were in good position. Feldman, Field, Kevin, and everyone else good was still there, so we paid the fee and got started........ONCE AGAIN......<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS vs. Some Jabroni's Funky RalOps<br>
<br>
I forgot his name, but he played so painfully slow it wasnt even funny. This was over from the time we paired. I crush Ralops all the time, but this one was raped. He drops Spaceport City and Presence of the Force, adding to the 2 TWIX sites I already had out. I drop Jedi Luke and saber there, and start draining.....for 4 a turn(thank heaven hes a scout, eh?) for the next 6 turns. I back him up with Han and Tawss, and he draws and gives me more places to drain at. IHe eventually gets a decent hit squad out, but I barrier and run, and get OTE to work on him......he never catches up for the early loss of 24, and he just eats up OTE to end the game. Win by 28.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+28)<br>
Highs: Winning I guess<br>
Lows: The game was BORING.....he didnt say a thing, and didnt put up much of any fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: DS vs. Kevin Shannon's LS AM/PM Too Much Good Stuff MWYHL<br>
<br>
I get to play Kevin again, and theres no one Id rather play there. The same deal pretty much happened with Jeff. He got DOS out, but getting Luke out to Vader slowed his training a little. I set up on Endor and Rendili to satisfy Honor, and went back to the Throne Room to duel Luke, hitting for 3 a turn. He comes down with Capn Han on Falcon, Redemption w/ Blount to where Zuckuss was, a mistake in itself, and I make him pay by stacking 1 on Insignificant and forcing him to land Han or suffer.  He drops Chewie and lands the Falcon. I respond with walkers and Trample Chewie, and commence beatdown on Han for another card on Insignificant. He finally flips and drops down test 6, prompting me to move over to Endor. He drops DOS there, and completes the final test, but cant move, so DOS is meeting Vader, Emporer, Mara, and a Walker with Veers inside. I battle, draw double thanks to Imperial Command, and the power is 19 to 31.......he either loses DOS and the game, or suffers a crapload of battle damage. He loses the damage and finds he cant move away anymore, so he battles and ends the game........another great game with Kevin. Win by 18.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+46)<br>
Highs: Beating the Comic Con Champ<br>
Lows: That IS too much good stuff........wait till the end of the report.....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS vs. Nick Stefanko's DS BHBM TIE Interceptor Hell<br>
<br>
This game was crap.....my deck got raped. He starts BHBM so Im expecting mains......he drops Kiffex and Kashyyyk and all of a sudden Im in trouble. I need sites, and draw for them, but I find more and more characters instead. He sets up Emporers Power and drops 2 TIEs to Kiffex. I drop Gold Squad One, Billy Dee, and Nien Numb, Frozen, DTF, Im the Leader(Basically everything that helps) and battle, but fail to get out any damage thanks to the sites I was drawing for, but for destiny. He Laterals the Falcon, and beats it down.....thats game......literally. Loss by 21.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+25)<br>
Highs: Nothing really....playing Nick<br>
Lows: Did you read the game?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4: DS vs. Dan Mochizuki's LS &quot;I stole Feldman's deck&quot; Profit<br>
<br>
He took Feldmans deck, changed 3 cards and played it. I still owe Danny Mo from last week, and I am willing to pay. I hit JP first turn with Emporer first turn, with Janus to back him up as well. I would sit there and drain for 3 the rest of the game. He drops Ben and frees Han. I drop DLOTS and battle, he plays It's A Trap!. He ponders over the next 5 minutes whether to battle or not and decides hed better not.....he cant exactly leave though, with Emporer and his cronies(I added Sim) and Force Lightning that would suck more than Vader. So I drop Veers and Ozzel(POWER PLUS ONE BABY!!!!!!) and battle him, and choke out Han and draw double destiny(Imperial Command) and check Ben into the Smackdown Hotel since Ben scrubbed out with a 0 for destiny. I run Tatooine, he goes to Endor with Luke, and I go there and wipe him out too......He cant do much at this point, Im pelting him for 4-5 a turn, and he just draws out. Win by 26.<br>
<br>
Final Score: 6(+51)<br>
Highs: Repaying the debt to Dan<br>
Lows: Dan had an awful day from SW.....went about 3-5 the whole day.....<br>
<br>
<br>
So I finish 3-1 again, coming in 6-2 the whole day. I get a little higher this time, here are the final standing......<br>
<br>
Winner: Paul Todd Feldman<br>
2nd: Alex Stefanko<br>
3rd: Alfred Dong<br>
4th Kevin Shannon<br>
<br>
There was a person who jumped in mid-tourney, and confused Steve with the prize support.....and I got screwed with prize support......so Steve took 1 pack of DS2 from both Feldman and Alex, and gave them to me. <br>
<br>
I open the first one, and see the Rebel insignia, and think to myself, what is this? Ten Numb? or my 5th Cracken? I pull it a little to the left, and see the deploy forfeit......8/9.......thats right. Another Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight for me. A great way to end the day. Feldman and Alex didnt exactly get screwed either......Alex pulled Emporer from the tourney before, and Feldman pulled Lord Vader, so everyone went home with something.......<br>
<br>
The funny thing was, Kevin and I had the most fun playing each other in our games, and by some miracle Kevin pulled Jedi Luke as well......now thats awesome......<br>
<br>
Thats it for me......Im about to pass out.......Check back in a few for my DS.........<br>
