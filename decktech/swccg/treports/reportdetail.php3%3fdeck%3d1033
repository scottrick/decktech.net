<br>
Intro:<br>
I promised myself I wouldn&amp;#8217;t write a tournament report unless I did good. Well here I am writing a tournament report and I scrubbed. Oh well, I decided I had to write one any way.<br>
<br>
Pre-Tournament:<br>
I left for 8-9 hour trip with my brother and dad on Friday. I still didn&amp;#8217;t have a LS deck, so I built one on the trip down. I was thinking about using Elom Beatdown with the New LS Obj, but I'd left my Eloms at home and couldn&amp;#8217;t build that deck. I decided on a variant of an ewok deck. We got into our hotel room at about 7:00 PM ate dinner. And then my brother and I played a few times. My Ewok deck edged out a few victories, so I felt ok about it. After making decklists, I went to bed at about 11:30. Some people on my floor were running around until about 2:00 in the morning so I didn&amp;#8217;t get much sleep. I was up at 6:00 and ready to play. After getting some breakfast, I got into the tournament room at around 8:00 and hung out until the start.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
LS: As I said before I played and Ewok deck. I had lots of Ithorians and a few Kazak's to enhance my drains. I also played a few numbers to use that nice 6 destiny of Jedi Luke.<br>
<br>
DS: My DS was a Court hit and run deck, with Scum, Imperial Barrier, lots of bounty hunter ships, and about 4 Maras. I felt pretty good about this deck.<br>
<br>
On to the games:<br>
<br>
Game 1: My LS vs. Justin Desai's Raltir Ops Beatdown deck.<br>
<br>
The details from all the games seem foggy to me now, but I'll try to be as accurate as possible. He started with prepared defenses, I think on of his affects was IAO. I started with Yarna. I got some ewoks down. He got some guys down on raltir, I think Emperor with Overseeing it personally at one site and Sim Aloo at another site. He then put out a system, w/ Bossk in Hounds Tooth. I came down with Home One, battled drew like a 0, he then came down with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and beat me down. I didn&amp;#8217;t have any ships left (lost my other Home One of the top of deck) after that I got in some drains, but it couldn&amp;#8217;t get enough to win. Justin wins by 18. <br>
<br>
Score: 0(-18)<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
Justin was a real cool guy, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t so bad losing to him. Getting an easy game next game.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
Losing, getting the home one pounded.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My DS vs. someones Hidden Base Deck (to whomever I played in this game, if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, sorry I forgot your name)<br>
<br>
	He was playing flip Hidden Base w/ Kessel Runs. He started heading for the med frigate, draw their fire, squadron assignments and Rebel Fleet (we both released he couldn&amp;#8217;t start this a few turns into the game when I altered it). I was pumped; my deck was build to beat space decks. First turn I come down with Mara and Saber (maybe the saber on second turn). Deployed Bossk in Bus and Zuckuss in ships to a system. He deployed Red Squad X-Wing and an X Laser. Blew Zuckuss away. I chose not to draw destiny since he didn&amp;#8217;t get one, and I hoped he wouldn&amp;#8217;t lose his ship. He only had to leave to so I he didn&amp;#8217;t lose the ship and he had no force to move away. Next turn I deployed Zuckuss in Mist from deck and Fett in Ship from hand, I beat him down for like 10, and after that it was just me trying to retrieve force from scum. I win by 46.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+28)<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
winning by enough to make up for my first loss. pounding his lone ship. retrieving a load of force with scum, my first strike and his draw their fire.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
I hate to make anyone loss by that much.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My DS vs. Charles Hoffman&amp;#8217;s profit deck.<br>
<br>
	I made the biggest mistake, I forgot to start to aliens. I started with Come Here You Big Coward. He freed Han pretty quick, but he didn&amp;#8217;t have to battle ground so he didn&amp;#8217;t retrieve the 10 (Jedi pack Han, also he&amp;#8217;d only lost about 4. We battled a lot all over the place, and drained each other some. My drains in space helped a lot. He kept trying to beatdown my lone Mara with nabrun and a mains crew, but I kept sensing his nabruns. In the end I ended up winning by 1.<br>
<br>
Score: 4 (+29)<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
winning, and sensing his nabruns about 3-4 times.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
not getting enough differential, forgetting to put down 2 aliens.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My LS vs. Cody Dicer&amp;#8217;s Court Beatdown<br>
<br>
	After losing my first game with this deck, I knew I had to try something different. I decided to start with Never Tell Me the Odds. Cody didnÕt think I could do that, so we called over the judges to check if it was ok. the judges said I could. He came down with Dengar w/ Gun and Evazen at endor back door. I deployed a few ewok scrubs to the endor docking bay then moved luke to back door. He came down with Iggyy w/ Gun and then battled. I copped Dengar and drew a 3 for battle destiny. He drew a 3 and a 4 (Iggy adding one). I had to lose Luke. Darn! From then I got ewoks out to drain, rebel barriering Vader and other big guys. I spread out my ewoks since most of his big cards were lost or on the table. Near the very end of the game, when he had 3 force left. He activated 2 and kept one for destiny. He played nabrun, drew a destiny 1 moved Lord Vader and Tarkin to a lone Ewok spearmans site. I had nothing in my hand and no force so I lost the ewok and 7 force. Next turn I drained him out. I win by 16.<br>
<br>
Score: 6 (+45)<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
nothing really, losing luke to battle destiny hurt, and that battle at the end didn&amp;#8217;t help.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
losing that last battle by so much. I could have one by 23.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My DS vs. Justin The Most Underrated Player in Kashyyyk Desai's Jedi Luke Obj/Speeder Deck. <br>
<br>
	He started heading for the med frigate, but for some reason I can&amp;#8217;t remember what he pulled. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that he did start with Your Insights Serve You Well as one of them. On my first turn I put deployed Jabber the Hut from reserve deck to audience chamber. He came down with 2 speeders and harc sef as a pilot to the great pit. I came down with Mara Jade, I battled, retrived 2 with scum. I didn&amp;#8217;t draw that great of a destiny because I think he only forfeited 1 of the speeders. I planed on doing that again and again since I had to Mara's in hand, and could draw back the ones I retrieved. But then he came down with more speeders, maneuvering flaps and Obi in the next few turns. I couldn&amp;#8217;t beat him by enough at that site, so I left him to drain there. I put a Mara and her Saber down on endor and captured Luke, because he was draining at the docking bay. He came down with Boussh later at the docking bay. He then put down Home one at a system and deployed battle plan. I came down with a load of bounty hunter ships, and beat down the Home One. He didn&amp;#8217;t loss that much because the Home's High forfeit. After that it was a drain race. Him paying force with battle plan and drains at the hoth 3rd marker and great pit, me draining at 2 systems for 2 at each one. I was also losing 2 from the LS Obj. I got Bane Malar down to cirpa's Hut, and was draining there also. Near very end he put down the JB Entrance Cavern. On my turn I drained him for six. And lost 2 and the end of my turn. I had 1 force left.  He had 4. On his turn he activated all, and drained me out. Justin win's by 4.<br>
<br>
Score: 6(+45)<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
none, I was really frustrated that I was so close, but still lost.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
everything. this game was not fun.<br>
<br>
Game 6: My LS vs. James Valeri&amp;#8217;s Ominous Beatdown deck.<br>
<br>
	This game made me really mad. Here&amp;#8217;s how it started out. We put out the starting stuff with our Objs. Then it&amp;#8217;s starting effect time, I say I&amp;#8217;m going to start signal and he&amp;#8217;s going to start prepared defenses w/ 3 effects. He has three effects sitting on the table, and I have my one. I say, ok I&amp;#8217;ll be starting never tell me the odds ( it came up last game and the dude lost some force) he says, oh wait you&amp;#8217;re starting that ( he still hasn&amp;#8217;t revleaed his 3 effects that are face down on the table. He puts one back in his deck and goes back and pulls out You cannot Hide Forever. I was like we&amp;#8217;re supposed to reveal our effects at the same time. So I go ask one of the judges. I didn&amp;#8217;tt really think the judge understood, because he didn&amp;#8217;t really say much. So ask if I can at least start of differant effect. I was now really mad, that was totally unsportsman-like conduct. So any was onto the game, I got lots of ewoks out to drain, and choose my battles with, houjixs and rebel barriers. He got some ships out, and I came down with the Home One to battle a star destroyer. It didn&amp;#8217;t really help though. Just enough to hold off drains for a few turns. I spread my ewoks out, and drained him out. I win by 11.<br>
<br>
highs:<br>
winning my last game.<br>
<br>
lows:<br>
him pulling that cheap move and the beginning, it just didn&amp;#8217;t seem legal to me.<br>
<br>
Final Score: 8 (+55)<br>
<br>
Well it was good enough (or bad enough) to get me 9th. Oh well, I didn&amp;#8217;t even make the top 8. As I&amp;#8217;m sure you guys probably know by now(or guessed) that Bretson beat Eric Hunter in the finals. I didn&amp;#8217;t really watch their games, but I know Bretson won the first one by 23 and then in the second game Eric won by 20. So Bretson is going to worlds. Anyway to sum it up, I guess I learned some stuff. I wish I had of had more time to build a better LS deck, maybe I would of done better, maybe not. It was nice to actually meet some of the top players in my region that I didn&amp;#8217;t really meet last year.<br>
<br>
props:<br>
<br>
