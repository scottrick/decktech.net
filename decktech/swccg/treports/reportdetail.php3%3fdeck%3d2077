It all started about a month ago, I played in the infamous PS2 tourny in fitchburg and scrubbed out horribly.  It was the worst performance of my life.  It made me rethink who I was as a player...was I even any good?  With a rating of 1915, beofre that tourny I thought I was pretty decent but afterwards I had my doubts.  Well anyway I vowed to play well at Mass states.  A few days before the tourny a sent out an email to the kashyyyyk region proclaiming I would not scrub out.<br>
So, the entire region is scrambling for decks and techs and other useless stuff but I am pretty much set for dark and set for light.  My dark has been in the process of being tested for about a month and is a machine...it&#146;s Mkos fortress(no hayes not the one you played against the day before) and WYS with lots of space to drain at kessel and enough land to hold onto a docking bay with fallen portals in there for backup.  So anyway thursday rolls around and my decks are set so I figure, I&#146;m going to go out and get hammered so I do and come back to my house at like 7 am and 15 Busch Lights later.  Getting hammered 2 nights beofre a tourny is good luck for me.<br>
So Friday morning rolls around and hayes hunter contacts me and is like let&#146;s do something.  I&#146;m like ok but there is no way I am drving cuz I am still piss drunk.  So he&#146;s like we&#146;ll meet up with these girls and do some stuff so I&#146;m like ok, I like High school girls just as much as the next college guy so I am in.  He tells me he&#146;ll be there in 30 minutes so I say ok.  2 hours later he gets to my house.  There are no High school girls so instead we go to play a few games at his friends house.  I take out like 15 cards from each of my decks so he won&#146;t get wise to what i am playing and hit the road.<br>
Friday night consists of me drinking more and sleeping little.  I make my decklkists and hit the sack...<br>
<br>
Saturday--Tourny day.  Wake up 6:30 in the morning, shower, eat hit the road.  Get to the Holiday inn to play.  Around 60 peopel there...41 are for mass states, soem others for NH and RI states.  The notable players include: Hunters, baroni, Gemme, Schiemer, and some other good talent. Theres also alot, and I mean alot of peopel who I do not recognize.  Could be a good thing could be a bad thing.  Welle enough of this garbage, onto the games.<br>
<br>
game 1:<br>
My Light.<br>
I get matched up vs Ryan D(sorry forgot your last name) <br>
<br>
He looks like he knows what he is doing but he does start the hoth system so I don&#146;t know what to think...I figure I&#146;ll play it safe and start battle plan along with my usual squassins and insurrection.  he starts hoth, mpoints, iao and decree...I figure he is going for big blue with decree for helpers...<br>
We first turn he drops a dude to a docking bay and goes...my first turn I drop wedge in ship to kessel and pull a docking bay...My hand is decent with an outrider and a jedi luke.  He drops a mess or guys to his docking bay next turn and moves em to the hoth docking bay(mine not his).  For the next 3-4 turns I drain for 3, fortify on land and flip...he pays 3 to drain for 1.  eventually he gets out the executor with some mofos and we rumble in space...I have outrider and artoo and 3po along with wedge against his executor and piet, I draw 2 destines(tracked 5s and he draws none cuz 3po had a bad feeling.  I have like 22 to his 9 and he loses peit plus alot more.  From then on I just drain him out...We have a few battles here and there but I just retrieve a few and drain battle him out.<br>
FW by 27.<br>
<br>
Highs--I was surprised how effortlessly my deck worked.<br>
Lows--Well my los pile consisted of 2 cards when we finshed so I guess I over deployed a little...<br>
<br>
Well Baroni won by 36(he played the kid that I beat by 48 at last years states so I&#146;m not sure that win is really that important tho:))  hayes won by 32 and Both my boys, Ben and mIke won big too.  Eric Hunter(defending state champ got the bye which was pretty lame and would prove to be cruial.  prett much everybodyt who was good there won their first game, Mike Gemme converted Luke with is BHBM in like 5 minutes.  Mike Schiemer squeked by a win by 7.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
<br>
My Dark<br>
I get matched up vs. Ben, which sucks cuz I came with him.  He plays there is good in him so I know I will win, and win by alot which sucks but what can you do.  Fisrt turn I get out the barge and deck and say go.  His first turn he activates alot and takes a risk and deploys ben with saber to my chamber...I have no none shall pass in hand so gets through.  But all is not lost however as i have chall might jabba, 4lom and fett in my hand.  I just activate and draw one.  he tries to fortify the cahmber but I just none shall pass his leia.  Next turn I drop the hit squad and beat up ben for like 20 damage.  Thats pretty much game.  I cancel his drains with myo and drain him out...late game i drop some fools so I can retrieve.<br>
FW by 29.<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning by alot<br>
Lows: Beating my friend by alot.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
My Light<br>
I get matched up with hayes since he beat baroni by a bunch ...theres still laot of undefeateds left...maybe like 8-9.  Me and hayes are 1-2.<br>
He&#146;s playing his abysins as I thought he would, I start battle plan, squassins and insurrection.  My opening hand has nout outrider or dash which blows.  I do have jedi luke and a signal and a captain han.  His turn he searches for a site and finds none and I see his deck...it is standard abbsins.  He drops bargaining table and goes...My turn i get out kessel, captain han and savrip.  His next turn he drops guri and bossk in ships and battles...when all is said and done i lose the captaina nd savrip teh rest, he loses fodder.  he drains on the ground but i set up menace fades.  He drains for 4 a turn and I drain fro 2 a turn.  Hmmm....Eventually he invades my cantina and luek goes in to stop it but luke gets smacked.  Th eonly way I can win this game is if i can beat him off in space.  Whcich is what my wys does, it plays 6 ships!  My hopes are dashed tho when i lose 2 dashes off the top and my other captain.  late game i try to fight a little more on the ground but he just overwhelmes me in total power.  he evetiually drains me out.  FL by 21.<br>
<br>
Highs: A good game.  He played his deck to perfection.  Savrip<br>
Lows: Me not being able to beat him up in space...No outrider.  I get space I might have a shot at wining this game.<br>
<br>
Well now there are about 6-7 undefeateds left And I have to play another one of them.  baroni won his game, gemmeis 2-1 too.  My boys both lost so they are both 1-2.  Eric won, Eric plays Mike Hawley who won and Hayes plays someone else.  I play Brian partrideg who beat me at states last year.<br>
<br>
Game 4:<br>
My Dark.<br>
<br>
We hee start TIGIH and teh docking bay stuff.  I srta my usual.  Early on i fortify my chamber and other sites and he gets luke with and asp droid and a catapault.  I was like..Ok.  Get out my anti retrieval @#$% and drain for 2 and 2.  he&#146;s draining for just 2 so he figures he&#146;ll attack me.  He drops han and orinmarko to my chamber.  I don&#146;t have a none shall pass but whatever.  He shots chall (he shoulda shot boelo or galid) but whatever, i lose chall and he loses orri.  next turn I drop jabba myo and dengar and beat the @#$% outta han for like 12 damage.  later on I kill his luke.  Thats game...he tries to retrieve but I have secret plans.  I never get out scum but I still win by 25.<br>
<br>
Highs:  My deck doing what it does best.<br>
Lows:  Nothing.<br>
<br>
Well now hayes is undefeated, Eric is undefeated, and Rick gaudioso is undefeated.  Rick and hayes play.  Eric is the lowest undefeated and baroni is the highest 3-1, I am second highest.  baroni should play Eric and I should play the 3rd highest 3-1(prolly mike sciemer) but things get screwed up.  Erik Play Eric M.(3-1 but less diff than baroni) I play Brian Partridege(again, even tho he has liek 40 less diff than me) and baroni plays some other 3-1 guy who has like negative diff...I talk to kris about this and he tells me just to play my games because there was some mix up...gah...<br>
<br>
Wel game 5:<br>
My light.<br>
<br>
Brain plays huntdown and strts the usual with secret plans.  I start battle plan and my usual.  Fist turn he gets choke vade saber to my cantina.  My first turn i deploy wedge to kessel.  So rightnow we both have drains of 3.  Not for long, I get nightfall boushh to cantina to stop his drain of 4(he had mara there too) and continue to drain for 3.  he deploys caroida mid game with bossk in bus but the outrider beats that down for around 7-8 damage.  I have this game, he spreads out on tatooine tho and  establishes a second drain, I deploy ben for 11(!!!) and lando with axe for free against his xizor...he somehow survives by just losing xizor.  Next  turn he moves over vader and duels him...I lose ben and 9.  F_uck!  Well no matter i am stil draining for 4 a turn and he is draining for only 2.  I retrieve with my edges late game and win by 21.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning. second turn drain of 3 again:)<br>
Lows:  Ben for 11...then he gets dueled!!<br>
<br>
Well hayes beat Rick with his light.  and Eric beat Eric M with his light..So Eric and hayes DO NOT HAVE TO PLAY! Gah frusterating.  So hayes plays baroni and eric plays rick.  So what I need to have happen in for me to win, hayes to win and eric to lose.  If Eric and hayes both win they are in the final.  If baroni beats hayes by 19, and i win by 27, and Eric loses it would be me and baroni in the final whcih would be orgasmic.  But anyway i figure I&#146;ll just play my game and see what happens.  <br>
<br>
game 6:  <br>
My Dark<br>
Paul laudenbach&#146;s EBO<br>
He starts the signal for ansb and i start my usual but get you cannot hide forever iunstead of tint/oppresive so i can grab search and destroy.  I get my guys out to my palace early as he sets up ebo.  He gets ebo like 4th or 5th turn and it turns out it is xwings.  Well here is what I do, I deploy jabba&#146;s space cruiser, mighty jabba, ephant mon, 4lom and iggy onboard the Jabba&#146;s space cruiser and battle a few of his wings.  he loses all his wings and a few more cuz I draw 21 attrition.  I lose nothing. ::::)  Well anyway the game just continues with me chasing his ships around, canceling drains with myo and raining on land.  I end up winning by 29 and I have no lost pile.<br>
<br>
Highs:wiining by alot...Beating up an ebo deck in space.<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
So Hayes won, All I need now is for Eric to lose...The game between him and rick is real close, I mean real close, But late game Eric beats Rick up for like 11 eleven damege and that is game...Hayes and Eric in the Final...Me in 3rd place.  ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!<br>
But  I really can&#146;t complain because if i had just beaten hayes when we played i could have guerenteed myself a place in the final and would not have to deal with the whole,&quot;if he loses to him, and he loses to him, Then I&#146;m in the final&#146;&#146; crap.  Plus Eric and Hayes played great all day and were the only undefeateds so hellz they deserve it...I would have liked to have gotten to play eric tho...<br>
<br>
Well Hayes played his dark in the first game of the fianls and won by 27.  he won his second game too by around 15 i think...?<br>
<br>
All in all I played pretty good and did not scrub out again so I guess i was happy.  It was really fun tourny and I played some really fun games.<br>
<br>
Props and Slops:<br>
<br>
My Boys ben and Mike: They both finshed 3-3 which wasn&#146;t bad after starting out 1-2.  Plus they are assing cool.<br>
Mike Gemme: for being mad cool...Mcdonalds @#$%ing rocked.  The outrider is the illest car ever!<br>
Steve Baroni: me and you had our chances bro...i wished one of us coulda gotten into the final.<br>
Hayes: you won it man! Congtrats.  Maybe while you&#146;re sleeping this year the night beofre worlds, I can be the one who&#146;s  out getting screwed by asian chicks?  Sounds like a deal to me.<br>
Eric:  you played well man...Congrats on being in the final.<br>
All my ooponenets--you guys played well.<br>
Myself:...I didn&#146;t scrub out.<br>
Kris earle:  He is the man...Kegger!!<br>

<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Busch light....Don&#146;t drink 15 b.lights and then take a sh_t...take it from me.<br>
All the kids in our region who are intimidated/worship the top player(s) in our region.  Don&#146;t be intimidated and don&#146;t worship them, they&#146;re human like everyone else and can be beaten.  Watch the movie &quot;the quick and the dead&quot; and grow some balls.<br>
  <br>
