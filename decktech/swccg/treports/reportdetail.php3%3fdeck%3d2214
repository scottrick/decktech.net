<br>
Note: The title of this TR is from a song called Dwarf Invasion by Common Denominator.  If you haven&#146;t heard this song yet, it&#146;s funny as heII.  Lines such as &quot;You are not my friend, you are my foe!&quot; and the background grunting keeping you laughing for hours.<br>
<br>
Just a little preface:  I&#146;m only 14 years old, this is my fourth tourney ever, and I live in the Coruscant region.  Result: wins for me are few and far between (with the exception of my last tourney where I went 5-1 and came in first, due to the lack of competition).  Right now, I&#146;m rated at 1470, but that should go up to about 1550 when/if big D ever updates things.  For LS I&#146;m playing a crappy WYS with 1 Harvest, Tat. Cel., and some Edges.  For DS, I have a basic MKOS with Abyssins (no swarm, just 3 of &#146;em).<br>
<br>
Anyhoo... this tourney is gonna suck, I have to leave early because my confirmation class is having some &quot;important meeting&quot; (read: bullsh!t that deprives me of a full, six game tourney).  My goal is to win three out of the four games that I&#146;m staying for, because the same people that showed up last time (even worse scrubs than me) are going to be there this time.  So, at 11:45, me and my three fellow scrubs set out for Belle Mead, NJ.  We get there, and there&#146;s only one other guy there plus Nathan Brown, the TD.  We fill out Command Cards, play a little, and then some more people start to show up.  First, it&#146;s just two of the same newbies that were there last time, so I up my goal to 4-0.  Then, Pete Flamini and Ghetto Leader show up and I decide 2-2 is more realistic.  We started around 1:10, not too bad.<br>
<br>
Game 1 - Am I Playing Myself? (Non-Interactive)<br>
My DS vs. Scott Matthews (Not rated, second tourney) MWYHL<br>
This is good.  I played Scott at the last tourney I went to and it was a fairly easy match for me.  Because he&amp;#8217;s new on the tournament scene (newer than me), he doesn&#146;t have much in the way of Meta, and I&#146;m pretty sure that this will be an easy win.<br>
I set up with the normal Scum stuff, Jabba, Mosep, and Boelo to the AC, Elephant Man and Bib to the Lower Pass, and some other characters spread out on Tatooine.  I know I can spread out thin, because an early game verification told me that he wasn&#146;t packing many characters. It took him quite a few turns to get set up, and he didn&#146;t even complete Test 1 until some time around turn 4.  Before that I had gotten out Gailid for a few turns of high, reserve deck only drains (Mosep is god).  About mid game, he sent Home One and Ackbar into space.  I dropped Fett in ship with Guri on board (don&#146;t ask why, I&#146;m still not sure) and initiated.  I lost Guri to cover attrition and landed Fett in ship at the Desert Heart (while holding a Ghhhk) to try and lure him on to ground.  On his turn he asks if he can battle landed starships.  I tell him he can and smile inwardly, because I&#146;m holding a bazillion and one characters in my hand.  He drops Obi and Daughter with Anakin&#146;s Saber and initiates.  He can&#146;t retrieve with First Strike because he can&#146;t pay for Secret Plans.  He draws low, I draw a 6 +2 from my Obj. and he loses Daughter.  My turn I drop Mara with her vibrator and the rest of the gang, initiate, I don&#146;t think I sliced Obi, but I can&#146;t remember.  Anyway, he loses Obi and then some.<br>
My drains and S + D damage were too much for him and by the time Test 5 was completed, he only had like 4 force left, so no retrieval.  I drain for the win.<br>
FW +23<br>
Cumulative 2(+23)<br>
<br>
The Good: I won my first game, and I&#146;m in first place so far! :-)<br>
The Bad: Not getting any experience that game<br>
The Ugly: Secret Plans stopping his late game retrieval, very non-interactive<br>
<br>
Game 2 &amp;#8211; Thank You Sir, Strike Up Another!<br>
My LS vs. Pete Flamini (1862) Pile of Court<br>
Flamini, eh? I&#146;ve heard that name before, in back streets and alleyways, so he must be good enough to beat me.<br>
He starts some weird stuff, Mob Points, Crush, and some other card, so I had a feeling he wasn&#146;t going to be using S &amp; V.  I was right; he got Vader and his glow stick to the Cantina where he drained for 3 the whole game.  I got Kessel in my hand, pulled the CC DB (which I never used for Edge-ing the entire game), lost 1 to Court, and drew some.  I soaked his drain of 3 for a few turns, while I built up in space and started Celebrating with only one site.  Some of the details in this game are a little blurry, but I remember that I used Dash and It&#146;s A Trap more times than I can count, and he couldn&#146;t find a grabber for either one.  These cards helped deal with the drain of 3 for while.  After I was confident with my space fleet holding Tatooine, I moved Dash and a RFC in the Outrider over to a previously deployed Kessel and started draining for three.  I also dropped ITTL to get some more drainage at Tatooine&#146;s generic DB.<br>
Next turn, he decided that he couldn&#146;t deal with the drain of 3, so he came to space with the Executer and Thrawn (somebody else?).  I drew decent, he drew low, so the Outrider stayed and Thrawn abandoned ship.  Next turn the Executer dies and I regain my drain of three.<br>
Next turn, he drops No Escape and two walkers with Xizor piloting to the generic DB where Wedge and Lando with gun had a formerly uncontested drain of 2.  Battle, First Strike kicks in, Wedge dies with a forfeit of a million.  I&#146;m not sure what happened on ground for the rest of the game, except that his drains at the Cantina weren&#146;t getting through with It Could Be Worse, C&amp;TV, and the ability to play them from my lost pile on my side.  Eventually, he was down to 4 and I was down to 7 without any drain defense left.  Mara and some others were with Wedge and Lando.  He forgets to activate and drains; now I&#146;m down to 3.  He goes to initiate the game winning battle (First Strike), but he doesn&#146;t have the force and that&#146;s game.  My turn, I retrieve 1 with Tat. Cel and drain him out.<br>
FW +4<br>
Cumulative 4(+27)<br>
<br>
The Good: Play and beating someone in the 1800s, I got some much needed experience and rating points<br>
The Bad: I won from his mistake<br>
The Ugly: Vader draining for 3 at the Cantina the whole game, Talon Karrde Dash-ing from the beatdown crew at the Cantina &amp;#8211; man does that old guy have quick feat!<br>
<br>
Now my friend Ryan, who got unbelievably good matchups is in first, because he had just beaten one of my other not-so-skilled friends by some insane amount (like 40 something)<br>
<br>
Game 3 &amp;#8211; The Tradition Continues (See &quot;The Ugly&quot; after this game)<br>
My LS vs. Ryan Lynch  (1447) COTVG<br>
Great, I come to a tourney and only get to play in four of the six games, and now I have to play somebody who I play almost every day.<br>
I don&#146;t remember anything at all in this game, except that he came down early with Snoova with Axe, Dengar with gun, and one other guy to put some whoopin&#146; on Melas and a RFC.  He drops First Strike, initiates, captures Melas with Snoova and shoots the RFC with Dengar.  I have 15 battle damage, but I Houjix my troubles away.  (BIG mistake right here, we both forgot that First Strike was out and I should&#146;ve paid 1 for the Houjix, but I didn&#146;t have any force left).  Next turn, I dropped Talon by himself to flip again and satisfy Court damage (He had Melas captured, but not at a JP site).  He beatdown on Talon, but he went for a swim in the Bacta Tank and I played the Houjix out of my lost pile (this time I remembered to pay 1).<br>
I had to shuttle my forces of the ground a lot, when I didn&#146;t have any Dashes or It&#146;s A Traps, because he had around 30 characters.  I did a little Celebrating here and there, a late game Harvest two turns in a row (once form lost pile) let me whittle him down a little before he claimed victory.  I established a small ground force consisting of Boushh (I dropped Nightfall before), Lando with gun, and Owen + Beru. They drained for a little, but then a small beatdown crew started chasing them.  My drains at Kessel and Tatooine weren&#146;t enough, and he drained me out at the end.<br>
FL &amp;#8211;12<br>
Cumulative 4(+15)<br>
<br>
The Good: Houjix, It&#146;s A Trap, and Dash saved many lives<br>
The Bad: Forgetting to pay 1 for Houjix<br>
The Ugly: I ALWAYS beat Ryan when we play at my house, but he always seems to win in tournaments.<br>
<br>
Game 4 &amp;#8211; Back for more, eh?<br>
My DS vs. Pete Flamini (1862) WYS<br>
This game was horrible, first turn I can&#146;t find any JP sites, so he gets to look through my deck.  I drew.  His turn, he can&#146;t find a DB so I get to look through everything.  We were both set back a turn, but he eventually got going, whereas I was talking longer to set up than it takes Decipher to update players&#146; ratings.  I eventually did get set up, though, with Mara and Bib at the LP and Gailid, Boelo, and Jabba at the AC.  I had some pretty nice sized drains, but I had to pay for Battle Plan. Now I had to use JP Jabba&#146;s text to its fullest in order to do anything during my turn.<br>
He got Jedi Luke and his posse to the Cantina and drained there the whole game.  I only battled twice in space with Zuckuss, who had to be Ghhhk&#146;d when Wedge in RS1 backed up Thereon Nett.  His drains and my lack of retrieval wore me down and my own Desert Heart did me in, as I lost the Sail Barge a while ago and nobody could get past the desert. I had a few Control Combos, which let me drain a few more turns, but then he set up Celebration when I didn&#146;t have enough force to pay for my drains so I drew up.<br>
FL &amp;#8211;9<br>
Cumulative 4(+6)<br>
<br>
The Good: Nice drains at my JP sites<br>
The Bad: His nice-er drains everywhere<br>
The Ugly: Desert Heart and no Sail Barge to cross it<br>
<br>
Sorry, I didn&#146;t get the final standings<br>
<br>
<br>
And now...<br>
<br>
<br>
The highly anticipated...<br>
<br>
<br>
...(drum roll)...<br>
<br>
<br>
PROPS AND SLOPS!!!!<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Me for having to leave early and not finishing in last, for beating someone in the 1800s, and for going 2-2 like I planned<br>
-The Only Game In Town for having food, drink, and lots of playing space<br>
-Nathan Brown for being a good TD<br>
-That kid who &quot;Forgot his pockets&quot;<br>
-The Only Game In Town for having God pulls in their packs (You should&#146;ve seen this, one of my friends pulled a crappy Emperor, a Jedi Luke Foil, and Rare Threepio Foil as one of his randomized cards in ONE pack!  There were also Palpy&#146;s, Luke&#146;s, Janus&#146;s, a Foil Palpy, and they were getting pulled left and right)<br>
-To the good competition that showed up<br>
-To the Dwarf Invasion song for being funny all heII<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Stupid religion for scheduling itself during a SW: CCG tourney<br>
-To me for not pulling anything special out of the God packs<br>
-To Decipher for never updating ratings<br>
-To me for not having a good memory of my games, next time I&#146;ll take notes<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it!<br>
