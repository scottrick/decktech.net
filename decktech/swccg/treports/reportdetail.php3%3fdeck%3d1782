<br>
Anyways...<br>
<br>
I have been out of it for a while.  I played in the I-10 Cup, and took 5th overall.  I guess that was ok, but I saw some things that I didn&#146;t like while I was at that tournament as the same with the next tournament I would attempt to play in.  Everyone was playing WYS for LS, either with Palace Raiders or Docking bays and Fallen Portals.  No one was having an original idea for their decks.  I got tired of playing against them, so I stopped for a couple of weeks.  <br>
<br>
I also play WWF Raw Deal, and Fully Loaded was just released, and seeing how I, Triple H was the defending Intercontinental Champion at the local game store, Gamers Edge, I had to defend my title.  That was when I was introduced to that interesting card called Turn the Tide.  I am no longer IC Champion, but its cool.  Trips doesn&#146;t need to be a Champion to be the Game.<br>
<br>
So The DPC is coming up and Girard is going to Normal to assist in the running of the event and wants me to go.  I get sick three weeks before the trip, and miss a bunch of classes, so I nix the plans for Brian to miss more class, so I stay home.  <br>
<br>
I wake up on Saturday and have to decide which of the two local tournaments to go to.  I could go to a Scenario tournament or drive into BFE Mesa and play at a small shop named Mikes Magic.  I decided the small shop would be better, scenarios aren&#146;t my thing.  So I head off to Mikes Magic, but the I-60 was a parking lot of stopped cars, some moving at a snails pace, so I take the first exit ramp, and take the surface streets.  This causes me to be 15 minutes late, but it is ok, SWCCG tournaments never start on time, right?  <br>
<br>
This one did.  I was given the bye and I walked around, bought some Raw Deal Singles, and chilled.  Then Mike Sinclair and the goblin walk in.  The goblin&#146;s name is Don, but he will be named the Goblin for the rest of the report.  They wanted to play as well, but they showed up with 15 or so minutes left in the first round.  They said that the other tournament was called off, due to the location being closed because of an eviction or something.  So the TD makes them play each other, and I still have the bye.  After 15 minutes of playing, and Mike kicking the goblin in the teeth several times, they were timed out.  Mike received a timed win.  <br>
<br>
I was playing Hunt Down for Dark and High destiny Mains for Light.  So now on to the games.  <br>
<br>
Game #1 – Bye<br>
2(0)<br>
<br>
Game #2 – DS vs. John Lopez’s Kashyyk Operatives &amp; Wookies.<br>
John was unaware of the errata that had crippled Operatives, so he deployed three operatives to three Kashyyk sites and ended his first turn.  I had drawn into a Lord Vader and my opening hand had his stick, so I stopped and explained the Errata, and asked him if he wanted to re-do his turn, so it would seem fair.  He took my advice, and decided to drop a Wookie with the Op at the Farm, and took back the two other Ops.  Then he ended his turn.  So my turn I dropped Lord Vader with his stick to the farm and picked a fight with them fellers.  The Wookie was cut in half and I drew Tarkin for destiny, so he loses the Op and that was it.  His next turn he dropped an Operative, a Wookie, and ended his turn, this time at the Jungle…or the Swamp.  My turn I deployed Mara jade there, and pulled her vibrator from the reserve Deck and she started a fight against them.  I cut the Wookie there like last fight, and drew a 6 for my destiny, so he lost the Op and some other cards.  Vader and Mara then moved to the central site and I ended my turn.  He then dropped two Wookies at the Farm, one with a Bowcaster, and ended his turn.  I deployed Tarkin at the farm, and moved Vader and Mara over, ending my turn.  On his turn he did nothing, he just let me go.  I Snipered the Wookie with the gun and then deployed Sim Aloo to the Farm, and Initiated a Battle.  He played panic, and drew into Chewie and Chewies Lightsaber.  He then Wookie Strangled Tarkin and missed Vader with Chewies gun.  I hacked the two Wookies up with lightsabers and drew a 6 for destiny, and he had no Destiny draw.  My next turn I deployed the Chimera with Thrawn aboard to Kashyyk, for some extra Force Draining.  I drained him out after that.<br>
Full Win +26<br>
4(+26)<br>
<br>
Sinclair won his game, so he was at 3(+??).  I was now in 1st.<br>
<br>
Game #3 – LS vs. Mathew Cenci’s BHBM Capture Deck.<br>
Mathew was trying to use a High Destiny, capture deck with both the JP: Dungeon and the CC: Security Tower with Bounty Hunters and All Wrapped Up.  I started with Yoda’s Hut and deployed the Hoth: DB and the Home 1: DB.  Turn 3 I deployed Ben Kenobi with his lightsaber to the Tatooine Docking Bay and ended my turn.  He deployed Darth Vader and initiated.  I hacked Vader, and drew a 2 for destiny, and he drew a site.  So Vader hit the Lost Pile and Ben stayed there to drain for 2 next turn.  His next turn, Vader #2 came to see Ben, and this time Ben missed with his stick (damn drawing EPP Han and Lando with Vibrator), so Ben moved away to the CC: Docking Bay.  Vader Force Drained for 1, but got Lost in The Wilderness of Tatooine and went missing.  Ben drained for 2 a couple of turns, then he encountered Ree-Yees, IG-88 w/gun and somebody else.  IG captured Ben and ended that fight.  I then dropped Jedi Luke with his stick, Dash, Corren Horn and Melas in an attempt to free Ben.  Well, Ben stayed captured and Luke had to run away after Mathew drew two 7’s for his destiny.  His 3rd Vader was deployed to Luke so Luke was captured and he ended his turn.  I then dropped EPP Han and EPP Lie against Vader.  Played I Know, and hit him for 12 extra Cards.  But of course both Han and Lie had to die due to him playing Vader’s Eye and drawing a couple more 7’s for Destiny.  Luke was free though, so I still had a chance.  His turn he Force Drained me and ended his turn.  I deployed Capt. Han to the same DB as Luke and played Off the Edge, retrieving 5 cards.  I then deployed Twass Khaa to the Tatooine DB to Force Drain for 1 the rest of the game.  He ended up deploying Jedi Pack Tarkin with IG-88, capturing Luke with Vader and Capt. Han with Jodo Kast and started moving Luke to the Throne Room, having 5 cards already stacked.  I noticed that IG-88 was not alone, being with JP Tarkin, so he could not draw Destiny at that location.  I deployed EPP Leia, and Chewie protector and Orrimarko.  I beat him up for the two characters and 15 extra Force; (playing Protector is pretty good).  That left him with 2 cards.  He activated 1, so he could move Vader over to the Throne Room, but could not duel me because he had 1 card in his Reserve.  He lost one card for his objective and then I drained him for 1 and won.<br>
FW +23<br>
6(+49)<br>
<br>
Mike again won his game, so he and I are the only undefeated players, but we both played the same side, so ended up not playing each other in the final game.<br>
<br>
Game #4 – DS vs. David Fosburg’s EBO Done Right<br>
I forgot Battle Order and Imp Decree.  I had to get going fast.  My opening hand had DLOTS, stick and the CC Beer Garden.  Turn 2 I deployed Vader and his stick to the Beer Garden and let him go.  I had a drain of 3 there most of the game.  TK422 canceled Visage, but was never backed up.  Mara came down and smacked around the Smuggler, drawing a 6 for destiny, Han and 3.  I eventually had Vader and Tarkin at the Beer Garden and Palpatine, Janus and Sim at the CC: Docking Bay draining away.  He dropped two X-Wings after getting EBO set up, but did not get Incom out, so they had no destiny.  I was not worried about Jedi Luke coming to Cloud city and wrecking the Emperor and his crew, because David used him to get up EBO.  So I deployed Bossk in the Bus, Zuckess in Mist Hunter, and the Virago at Kiffex to deal with the X-Wings.  I drew a 4 and a 5, so he lost the X-Wings and 7 Force.  I later Deployed the Chimera with Thrawn to Rendili and moved the virago over there as well, after deploying Xizor aboard.  I ended up draining David out.<br>
FW +23<br>
8(+72)<br>
<br>
I came in 1st, due to Sinclair having the timed win in the first game; he took second at 7(+90).  I received a Star Wars role Playing T-shirt for 1st and a pack of DS 2.  <br>
<br>
Props: <br>
- David for running the Tournament.<br>
- Triple H for being the Game.<br>
- Sinclair for Timing out Game 1.<br>
- Me for deciding to play SWCCG again<br>
- Girard for being Girard.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
- I-60 for making me late.<br>
- Sinclair for Timing out Game 1.<br>
