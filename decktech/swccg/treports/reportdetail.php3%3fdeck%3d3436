<br>
Ventura tournament:<br>
<br>
Wow, where do I start&amp;#8230; Well, as we know lately most of the tournaments in alderan region there are less participation and less frequency in tournaments. Because of this circumstances will all have to travel far and far lands to play. (Thank you WOTC) Its alright I guess, I will survive&amp;#8230; I was waiting for this tournament for weeks. I knew a cats tournament has a good turn out, prizes were great and people were competitive. Also, I have my crew of four who travels with me so I thought it will be a huge turn out. Well it was to be. Ed and josh called me in the morning of the tournament tell me that they were sick and unable to go. That sucked right there. Stupid flue Suddenly my crew of four went down to 2. James and me grab our decks we made last night and decided to travel 75 miles to Ventura. When we arrived there, cat informed me that he forgot his decks at home and forgot to call people for the tournament. I offered cat two decks too cat but he declined. So only had 4 people show up. Half the tournament was my crew&amp;#8230;yippee<br>
<br>
My decks, there is an uprising on Endor with lots of mains and toys. My wattos bullies for dark. U can see both of these decks in my deck list. <br>
<br>
First game. <br>
<br>
James Zajics dark deal Vs Endor uprising<br>
<br>
This was a fast game I ever played in a long time. He activated and deployed all the sites and drew. I activated and pulled my generals and took over bespin with red 4 and wedge.  I deployed General carrison with gold one to the endor system. Deployed Leia to the bespin-docking bay.  I said go. He activated, deployed cloud sector and drew some cards.  He said go. At this point I was worried about big beat down somewhere. So, I activated, drain for 4 and deployed crix to the farm with Patton and midge, Luke with saber to the Leia site for extra forfeit. I had fallen portal and skywalks in the hand. I draw the last 4 force. Made a hand again. He activated and deployed Vader and maul with saber also piett to the Leia site. I was in some hot water but it was ok. He initiates the battle. I used fallen portal and skywalks. I hit maul with fallen portal with a 6. Yes, what a luck He swings and hits Lukas. I swing but Miss Vader with two 3&amp;#8217;s which sucked. Right after that he sensed my skywalks. I Drew a 4 and he drew 4. I made Luke go bye bye and he made piett go the lost pile. He had no force left so he said go. I activated and drain for 4. No it was my time. The last four cards I drew were, obi one with lightstick, Han with gun, chewie with gun and hand maiding.  I deployed all four and pulled qui with stick. I initiated and swung at Vader and hit him with 6 and 2. He swings and hits Leai in the ass. I pull my destinies of 6,6 and 1. There was the game. Hit him for 31 to 8. 23 force loss. <br>
<br>
Full win by 21<br>
<br>
Good: everything went well.<br>
Bad: Got sensed. What the hell<br>
<br>
<br>
Second game:<br>
Paul fedmans hidden base main v watts bullies<br>
<br>
This game was the best game I played in a long time. I knew what Paul was playing. His tatoining mains and toys deck with fallen portals and I will take the leader. <br>
<br>
My deck had a podracing with wattos box starting. Yes wattos box. It is a devastating deck with 11 force loses. Only draw back was one watto in the dam deck.  He did not know so it was cool. <br>
<br>
First turn I start the pod race. I activated and used 2 force with to cancel his draw. I drew a 6, which was nice. Then deployed watto from reserve deck to the junkyard and blizzard 2 to the mos espy. Made him lose to. He then pulled his defensive shields for wattos box, a grabber and battle order. I moved blizzard to the junkyard for some protection.  Then said go.<br>
He activated and pulled Endor tattooing docking bay. He said this is going to be a quick game. I said we would see. He deployed Leia with gun to the junkyard. This is where I made the only mistake in the game. He initiated the battle. I forgot to tell him he does not get a destiny at the junkyard and forgot to tell him that watto was in the blizzard. So He shot the watto and pulled a two for a destiny (jar jar). I pulled 0. Only zero in my deck for a destiny. Leia was saved. He clears the site and moved her over the pod-racing arena for protection. Then unthinkable happen. Use out of commissions. I was shocked. I had 2 cards in my lost pile. 50/50 chances of getting watto. So, he out of commission watto. Nooooo. Cat walks over and has no the game is over. I sign to him and he says go.<br>
I activated and pulled another 6 for destiny and he drew a 2. I draw everything up. I need to beat the hell out of Leia. I knew Leia was the key to the game. I look over and said go. He activates and pulled tattooing system and another docking bay for the tatoining. Deployed wedge and his ship to tattooing and said go. <br>
I activated and pulled destiny of 3 for the pod race, which was fine. I was at 24. He drew a 5. I started to move cards around in my hand to see. What can I do? I hand a bomb hand. Have Vader with stick; maul with stick, ozzel, 4 scout vehicles, sense, admiral piett, guri, and Dr Evans combo, tattooing occupation. I would say this is a great hand. Only problem was there was no ship in. what the hell. I have like 6 ships and have not seen anything yet. I deployed 2 vehicles to the pod racing arena and said go. He looks at me, wondering what I was going to do. <br>
He activated and drains for one at the system with wedge paying for his effect. He deployed another ship to the tattooing system. The new falcon had that system locked. But he had to pay for 2 for upkeep. Which sucked for him. He also deployed the new threepio to the docking bay and I will take the leader. He put a card back to draw another one with pants showing. He pays for the upkeep of falcon and said go. Whets this he did protect Leai at all. He must have a ghkk in hand. He must. Pod race is going to end this turn what the hell. <br>
I activate and drew a nice 6 for the destiny for the pod race. Then I deployed Vader with stick, rest of the scouts vehicles, ozzel (hey its free) and maul with stick. I initiate the battle. I hit Leia with maul. He tries to shout maul but missed. I pulled destiny of 2 and he pulled a 3. I hit him for lose of 15. Poor Leai got her @#$% handed to her. I lost maul with saber to the destiny. I have 2 other mauls. Right after that he lost 11. Not bad for lost of 26 in one round. I suddenly had the upper hand. He hand nothing left. He look over to the lost pile and said, &amp;#8220; I was winning at one point right?&amp;#8221; I giggled and moved my characters to wattos junkyard. And drew the last one. I did not retrieve anything because of aim high. Nothing in there accepts for 2 cards.<br>
He activated and deployed did not drain me. He deployed Lando enraged and obi van with stick to the docking bay and put down celebration on tattooing. Moved obi van to the Lando site and paid for the up keeps of 4. Then said go.<br>
I activated and drain for one moved over the one of the scouts the empty docking bay. Draw 6 and let 2 for react. He knew what I was going to do. I pulled my defensive shields, secret plans and oppressive enforcement and a grabber. And said go.<br>
He activates and drains me for 2 and retrieve one with paying. And moved Lando to the pod-racing arena. And said go.<br>
 I activated and drained for two at a price of 6. Deployed another maul to the landos site and put hounds tooth in empty system to satisfy the battle order. Said go.<br>
He activated and drains for two and retrieve one. Maul made Lando not presented. He drew some and paid for upkeep. Said go<br>
I drain him out for 4 a turn.<br>
<br>
Full win 25<br>
<br>
Good: winning against a good player with one mistake<br>
Bad: not remembering the wattos junkyard text<br>
<br>
Pauls feldmans dark deal vs. my Endor uprising<br>
<br>
These games over after the first draw of the cards. Seriously. I had 7 red cards and 1 green weapon. <br>
He pulled his sites and activated and deployed them said go. I activated and pulled my generals and deployed crix with Paton, got some cards and said go. He activated. Then deployed Vader with stick and maul with stick and boba fett bounty hunter front of the crix. He initiated battle.  Swung and hit everyone and pulled destinies of two fours. Hit me four 13-battle damages. I got a destiny of 7 to help me for the lost cause. He lost Maul. Right after that, he noticed that boba fett was going to the preeminently lost. He tries to take the maul back for fett but I said battle is over. He lost two forces to keep boba fett there. I activate and decided to leave Endor to the damm imperials. So I deployed gold one to Endor system, Leai to the cloud city-docking bay. I knew he has no good characters left. Drew some up and said go. He activates and drains me for 2 at the farm. He deployed the emperor to the docking of Endor and Darth sidious to the carbon camber. He said go. He lost another two forces for boba fett. Hey this boba fett like visage. I Like him.hhhhh<br>
I activate and drain him for two and deployed Luke to the Leai site and with figrin Dan there. I need to retrieve some right. <br>
He activate and drain me for 4 and put down ig-88 with gun and blizzard 4 front of Luke and Leia Intimate the battle ig-88 shot Luke. I do not know how but he did. With destiny got Leia. I clear the site but figrin Dan is going to get killed. Ouch. He said go<br>
I activated and drain for 2 and drew about 6 cards. And said go. Could not do anything. <br>
He activated and drains me for 4. Deployed garrison troopers x2 and xizor. Intimate. Hit me for 15 damage. That was it. Not a fun game to me. But made me think about that first hand of crap.<br>
<br>
Full lose of 18<br>
Good: Lando was not harassed at all. What a man. Thank god for the dark deals deployed of effects. He had his 1/3 of deck deployed. Wow that helps.<br>
Bad: first hand was a killer. What the hell<br>
<br>
<br>
James Zajics turning Vader over wattos box<br>
<br>
This was another fast game. Reason is I had blizzard 4 for the start. It was over in first turn. Some hows against James I always have a great hand? It&amp;#8217;s my luck I think.<br>
I activate and deployed blizzard 4 to the docking bay and pulled Vader for free. He looks shocked. I deployed watoo for free. Moved Vader over and got Luke to be my @#$%. <br>
I said go. He activated 6and said go. I activated and started to race with fat seven and deployed maul with stick to make him lose two. Then moved Vader to the blizzard 4. Then said go.<br>
<br>
He activated and keeps his 6 force there. I activated and drain him for 3 and pulled another 7 for destiny. Made him deploy boba fett bounty hunter for free to docking bay. Also deployed Darth sidious to the watoo for extra protection. Said go. He activated and drew one. Said go.<br>
I activated and drew another 7 (have 6 sevens) and use the two force for deploy 3 scout vehicles to Endor. Made him lose 11. That was the game. He never came down or did nothing. I know it was boring game but it was over in the first turn.<br>
<br>
Full win 43<br>
<br>
Good: First turn capturing Luke<br>
Bad: no battling or nothing<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Went 3-1 with a nice differential. I like did.  Next time cat call people and remind them and do not forget your cards.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for reading<br>
