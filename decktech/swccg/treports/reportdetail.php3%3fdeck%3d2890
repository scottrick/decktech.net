<br>
Well, my friends Ryan and Greyson and I heard about this tourney about a month ago.  We started to test decks (especially DS) and nothing was clicking.  So I tried out ISB troopers, no it sucked and I won&#146;t even go into how much it loss by.  BHBM, well it is like Brian Hunter said, BHBM is a auto-win.  So, I didn*t even think about that.  I then turned to a scum deck (except I don&#146;t have Scum and Villiany) so I just decided to go with mains and occupation damage.  It was tight.  In all of the playtesting if never lost a game.  It wrecked QMC, HB Flip, Senate crap (does anyone play that?), and anything else we could think of.  So I decided to go with that, but I forgot to play it against a Dagobah deck.  But I knew NO ONE in Oxford play*s Dagobah, but that would later prove wrong...<br>
<br>
So Ryan and Greyson both were playing solid HD Racing.  The only problem for them was LS.  Ryan was going to play his trustworthy QMC, and Greyson had no clue what to play.  So on Friday night before the tournament I made him a WYS Racing/Beatdown/DS Senate kicks it*s @$$ deck:)  I made him think it was good, and he loved it LOL:)  Well, now it was on to my LS deck.  The only objective I have for the LS besides WYS is Hidden Base.  So I built a Hidden Mains deck w/2 Too Close For Comforts, 4 A Step Backwards, and 2 Neck and Necks so I wasn*t EVER gonna lose the race.  And also losing 11 is gay, and racing is gay.  So um...I support that dude who wrote a article about Deciphercon and how there was going to be a riot about Podracing or some crap that like that.  So there you have it, that is most of what happened befor the tourney.  Oh yeah, I am also bringing my friend Bryan Pearce, and this is his first tourney.  Also, this week we needed a name for our team, so we decided on Team Just Bring It.  Sounds good, eh? BTW, this is our name because The Rock is the man, until Triple H comes back:) (That was a note to anyone who watches WWF)<br>
<br>
Ok, here our decks:<br>
Brian Speight (me): LS, Hidden Mains DS, MKOS Mains (not like Hunter*s, better j/k:)<br>
<br>
Ryan Obman: LS, QMC DS, HD Racing<br>
<br>
Greyson Thompson: LS, WYS (that he can&#146;t play worth crap) DS, HD Racing<br>
<br>
Bryan Pearce: LS, WYS DS, Senate<br>
<br>
Rating going in: 1540 (Call me a scrub, but I am not one, just keep reading:)<br>
Tournament<br>
<br>
We arrive at C and B comics at about 11:45 and the tourney starts at 12:30, so now we can trade and stuff.  When we arrive Carson Swanek, Lewis, and some other scrubs.  Ryan and Grey buy some singles for there deck while I wait and see if anyone else is coming.  So about 10 minutes later, Adam Weinstein (our State Champ, he is cool), Henry Jicha, Jason Hairston, and Mike Merletto come.  So now our team has some competition.  Looks like a good tourney.  Oh yeah, also some South Carolinians, 1 being the State champ, crap this doesn&#146;t look too good.  So after a little bit of talking with Mike, the tourney is about to start.  Also, just to let you know, Mike was the only member of Team C0ckbomb who was there.  So Charles calls the pairings out, and the games begin.  Also, we are having 3 rounds today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1:Hidden Mains vs Carson Swanek*s Maul/Jp start<br>
All before the tournament he was talking about his DS kicking @$$, so I knew I had to play him just to see what it was.  He starts Mauls Hut and JP, I start YISYW, Staging Areas, and Insurrection/Aim High.  He isn&#146;t racing, dang.  Oh well.  Well, get a pretty good hand, and he does to because I can tell by his face.  He activates, uses JP text, pulls Audience Chamber, and draws up.  My turn, activate, deploy Tatooine and Home One docking bay.  Draw some, and get Lando, EPP Han, and EPP Leia.  Sweet.  I say go.  I think he just draws some, and plays Evader/Monnok Used.  He gets some stuff of mine like OMDH, but I had 3 in hand, so no biggie.  My turn, all I can remember is that I deployed EJP Lando, EPP Han, EPP Luke, and EPP Leia to battle his Mara and Tempest 1 w/Igar.  I iniate battle, exclude Mara.  I draw 4 destiny and I he draw Fondor and like Dagobah Cave for destiny Woo-hoo! He wasn&#146;t happy.  So it is Tempest 1, Igar, and 18 more.  Ouch, that wasn&#146;t good for him.  Eventually, Mara got cleaned off the table and so did a late game Maul.  He did get me on one battle though.  I had Tawss Khaa by herself and he dropped Boba Fett w/gun and some scrub.  He missed Tawss Khaa, and I drew a 5 for destiny.  He drew a 0 again, I think, so I just lost Tawss due his power.  So then he moved Boba over with P-60 and P-59, and I wasn&#146;t gonna touch that.  My turn, I drop Wedge on his ship, OMDH targeting him, pay like 9 and retrieve some.  Eventually he gets battle off, and I get a Full Win by 35.<br>
<br>
2 +35<br>
<br>
It was a great game and Carson is a excellent player. His DS was good, just that he had too many twixxes in there.<br>
<br>
Game 2:MKOS mains vs Greyson Thompson<br>
Don&#146;t you hate it when you play your friend? I do, but hey I built this deck, and I knew it inside out, right? Wrong. I will explain.  In my hand I get Imp. Command to I play that to get Piett.  Ok, he is racing, so on my turn I stall him, draw Lord Vader that sucks.  Get Executor Docking Bay, drop Piett there, he gets Merrjek, Merrjek gets out Tatooine.  I draw some, and say go.  His turn he flashes Red 10 and gets Theron Nett in ship at Kessel.  He deploys Mirak Terrix and Pulsar Skate from hand there, and then drop EPP Han and Chewe at the Tat. Docking Bay.  He flips, so I don&#146;t think I am gonna battle him any where soon.  My turn, I activate 18 and draw a 1 for race destingy.  Deploy Battle Order and get out Fondor.  I deploy Executor there and then Thrawn, shuttle up Piett and Merrjek and then move to Tatooine.  Draw some and get a ground crew going.  His turn, he pays 3 to drain for 3.  He deploys Jedi Luke in Cantina and moves over Han and Chewie.  Draws some and says go.  My turn, activate 18.  Race, I draw a 1.  So now it is 22-12.  That sucks, but this deck can win and still lose the podrace, so that is now biggie.  So I use Audience Chamber to deploy Mighty Jabba there.  Drop Xizor and 4-lom at audience chamber.  Drop Gailid, Mosep, and Dr. E/Ponda Baba at Lower Passages.  Then drop Janus and Chokk to Jabba&#146;s Palace.  Deploy Maul aboard Executor, and deploy Tatooine Occupation.  Move over Executor to Kessel and say go.  He drains for 2 in Cantina.  Flashs Dash, and gets out Outrider.  Deploys that at Kessel, then deploys Melas there.  And that was the card he bought earlier today.  Crap, that sucks.  So he battles me and makes the Executor power -6.  So I decide to add one with Imp. Command rather than to make him draw only 1.  So I draw a 4, 4, and 1.  Ok, not to bad, but could be better.  So I get rid of Merrjek and he covers it all.  He gets rid of Mirak Terrix, and can&#146;t move away to cancel Tat. Occupation.  My turn, I drain for 6 from reserve and hit him for 3 for Tat. Occupation.  We race, and he wins obviously.  So, he pays 6 to retrieve 6 during my move phase.  I drop Boba Fett in Slave 1 to Tatooine and deploy Stinger ther for fodder.  Then deploy Guri with Xizor*s gang.  So I move Executor over to Tatooine.  Draw 2 because I only have 14 left.  He drains for 3, and they come from reserve.  Then 2 at Cantina, and that comes from hand.  Then he moves Chewi and Han out to Tat. Docking bay and I pray that he draws 5 or more cards because he only has about 15 in his reserve deck.  So believe it or not, he draws 7, which leaves his 8 in reserve and my 11 in my reserve.  Crap, this is too close, I didn&#146;t know that MY deck could beat me.  That is scary.  So I knew I couldn&#146;t lose.  My turn, drain for 6 from reserve, which leaves him with 2 in there.  Occupation damage for 3, which come from hand.  Then I drain for 1 at Tatooine.  He moves over Red 10, Outrider, and the Skate to Tatooine.  Then he moves Chewie to CC Docking Bay (he used Tunnel Vision to get that out, sorry I forgot about that).  Plays off the edge, and draws a 5.  So he is like yes, I retrieve 4, and I remind him about Secret Plans and he is very pissed.  So my turn, I drain him out and win by 2. (We battle a little, that is why I only won by 2)<br>
<br>
4 +37<br>
<br>
Great game, and he had me for a little but 6 from reserve hurts.  Now I know my opponent will be hard the next round.<br>
<br>
Game 3DS vs Henry Jicha&#146;s MWYHL Luke/Obi beats<br>
I don&#146;t even want to go into this game because it wasn&#146;t even funny.  He won the podrace, and then had a drain of 5 the whole game at Desert Heart.  I couldn&#146;t battle him, because I would get my tail kicked.  Well, that is all that happened and I am not kidding either.  He just owned me and there was nothing I could.  Just D-mail him and ask him, he will say the same thing.  Plus, I think he wanted me to keep his LS confidential, whatever. FL -20<br>
<br>
4 +17<br>
<br>
He played very well, and I just couldn&#146;t get out Occupation or my characters.  Plus, his destiny was crazy. So Grey and I go over to the Video Store to get some Pizza but they are sold out.  WTF?  So, now we are stuck in Oxford with no food.  Hmm...this sucks.  So I remember seeing some biscuit place on the way here, so we go check to see if they are open.  Nope, closed, crap.  Then I see a CVS across the street, and we go ther. At least they have a store where you can buy Medicine:)So we go in there and buy some chips and a Mountain Dew.  We get in the line and their is this old lady in front of us buying like 50 cans of Mountain Dew and Pepsi.  Then get this, she is paying the whole thing in one dollar bills!! Geez, how stupid can you get?  So after sitting there for 10 minutes (they had to recount, like Gore&#146;s sorry @$$ did).  So we get up there to pay for our crap, and we have the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in front of me.  Dang, she looks good!:)So get this, she asks me to if I want a bag so put my stuff in, I am like yes ma&#146;am.  So she bends over (I am not going to tell you what I saw because this is Decktech after all) to get a bag.  OH MY GOSH!  It seemed like a minute before she came back up.  It is one of the best moments in my life.  I think she liked me to because when she looked at me she winked and licked her lips.  We won&#146;t go there though.  So we rush back and I don&#146;t have time to eat.  Crap.  I am pissed now, and I don&#146;t care who my opponent is next game, their sorry @$$ is gonna get beat by at least 30.<br>
<br>
Game 4:LS vs Build the DS II (forgot his name, sorry dude)<br>
This is a deck I can win by 40 against, so I say I have to win by 40.  He is playing EOps and gets out Jerjerrod who gets a sector.  He drops all of this DSII junk and says go.  I have a cool hand with Corran, EPP Leia, and EPP Han.  So I decide to wait a turn, and see if I can lay the smack even harder.  So I get out Tatooine with my objective and drop Alderaan from hand.  Ok, that is cool.  Draw 1 and it is Tawss Khaa, ok beatdown army is ready.  I say go.  He finishes building the DSII and moves it to Tatooine.  Then he leaves Jerjerrod by himself in the Bunker.  Now, in all of the hundreds of games of SW I have played you never leave anybody alone at a site who can&#146;t draw destiny and has low defense value.  So I decided I would teach why not to.  My turn, I activate just enough for the beatdown.  He has no force, which means no barrier which is even cooler.  So I drop Corran Horn there and here is what happened:<br>
<br>
Jerjerrod: &quot;Um, security how the heck did he get in here?&quot;<br>
Security:&quot;Sir, we have found out he DOES have a Code Clearance and it is NOT a Older Code.&quot;<br>
Jerjerrod:&quot;Well, now Leia, Han, and some little muppet are coming in, what the funk is your problem.  Send Vader here now, these guy DON&#146;T have a Code Clearance.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Few seconds later, Jerjerrod finds out that he is a little scrub who can&#146;t play the game and is by himself with the part of the Rebel Army!  Man, NEVER leave a Jerjerrod by himself, NEVER!  What a...ah we won&#146;t go there.  Geez, I tried to tell the guy after he lost 20 force (which was all from his reserve deck, even though he had a 15 card hand) that you NEVER leave him there by himself.  He just says okay.<br>
<br>
Well, I do some late game retrieving with OMDH and win by 34.  Dang, I was hoping 40...<br>
<br>
6+51<br>
<br>
Now I can eat, but you should know what I am thinking about:)<br>
<br>
Game 5:DS vs Mike Merletto&#146;s Dagobah Cheese junk<br>
Ok, basically I don&#146;t want to tell you what happened here because of the same reason for Henry.  He won the race and Luke and Obi did there crap.  It was the gayest game I have ever played.  He just owned me.  Oh well.  It was a good game, and Mike is a excellent player.  FL -38<br>
<br>
6+13<br>
I guess I am still postive:)<br>
<br>
Game 6:LS vs Adam Weinsteins DS Senators<br>
I won&#146;t go into much detail about this game because of the same reasn above.  Well, he did race and I won.  He then did the shaft on me, then Visage came out.  Then his objective made me put back the only 2 cards in my hand.  Then Limited Resources for 4.  Well, I could have won if I could have retrieved when I won the race.  FL -4<br>
 <br>
6+9 Whoa! if you take out the + you get...:)Sweet!<br>
<br>
Well, it was a awesome tournament, and the South Carolina Champion won today.  He won a box, which is cool.  He went 6-0, so he is the very good.  Good Job Brad.  Anyways, I come in like 8th, Ryan 7th, Grey, 6th, and Mike comes in I think 3rd or 4th.  Well, he did great and congrats on him and our Team.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
My mom for driving<br>
Me for being at CVS at that right time:)<br>
My decks for being great, I could have beaten Adam...oh well<br>
Meeting some more cool guys<br>
Mike for showing up just so we could talk about stuff<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Hmm..none really, it was a real cool tourney. <br>
<br>
Good Job on reading this report, it took 2 hours to type.<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
