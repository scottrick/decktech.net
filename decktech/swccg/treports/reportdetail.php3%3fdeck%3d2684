Well this is Chris Wo@#$%a and this is the 4th report so far from this event. Seems like a bit much for a local but oh well. This was going to be Brad Vogel&#146;s second tournament and it was at the cardshow at Tri-county Flea Market in Levittown, New York. Last time I got 6th place with 4(=14) so I was hoping for a better performance. Brad tells me Decipher can&#146;t send him foils by the 21st so I offer to donate my foil Emperor as 1st prize. So this is cool and I figure there is always a chance I could win it back, plus I did well with only one Emperor anyway. So I have to make decks. I used a version of The Pile last time and SYCFA flip. Well both went 1-1 so for light I made a WYS without racing and for dark I had no idea what to use. I have made a Brangus racer and a SYCFA Tie deck but I&#146;m not too comfortable with either. I plan on making a BHBM with SAC since only one or two people use WYS around here and nobody ever starts DODN &amp; WA. Well the night before the tournament comes, I take apart the WYS and make a HBX deck similar to Lewis&#146; but I don&#146;t own any Jedi Lukes so I use Qui-gons and I don&#146;t own Concentrate All fire or whatever so I use Taking Them With Us. It makes Qui-gon deploy for 5 and defense value of 9, cool. I never do get to build the BHBM so I am screwed. My friend from school, Andrew Flynn, who just started playing is getting a ride with me to the tournament. So I wake up, drive to his house using directions I got from Mapquest.com. In the car ride I have to lend him about 30 cards for each of his decks. He is using HB with various ships and a Walker Garrison deck without Imperial Commands or Occupation since neither of us own those. We arrive at the place around 10:35 or so. It starts at 11. I see Wayne Cullen and his cousins, Brad&#146;s friends, and Matt Ehrhart. Well now I&#146;m pretty sure he is going to win the foil Emperor since I&#146;ve only beaten him once in like 20 games and it was by one card in a fun game before a tournament way back last April. Well two Mastic people show up and Bill Power comes in, he was walking around before I guess. We&#146;re now waiting for Sam, Alex, Steve, and Pete. They show up with like all these people but most of them aren&#146;t playing. So when we start we have 17 people. The 3 Mastic people from last time didn&#146;t come this time and it would have been interesting if they did.<br>
<br>
My decks:<br>
Dark: Brangus racing<br>
Light: Lewis X-wings with weird card choices due to my lack of rares<br>
<br>
Andrew&#146;s decks:<br>
Dark: Walkers without stuff like Imperial Commands or Occupation (I didn&#146;t have them so he couldn&#146;t borrow them)<br>
Light: HB with various ships<br>
<br>
My rating: 1638 (down from 1665 last tournament)<br>
Andrew&#146;s rating: 1500 (first tournament)<br>
<br>
- Games -<br>
Game 1: My Brangus deck that I have never won with Vs Tim Jamilkowski&#146;s (1464) EBOX<br>
Well this is Brad&#146;s friend and it&#146;s his 3rd tournament. He starts the usual EBO stuff, no racing. I start SYCFA stuff and my racing cards. He doesn&#146;t start Anakin&#146;s racer. I pay 2 on my turn to not make him draw and I get a 5 I think. I then Masterful Move for the Holotable, deploy the War Room from reserve, and I draw up. He pulls his two Echo sites and draws. I get a high race destiny again and I think draw some more. He deploy his last Echo site and deploys Zev, Hoth Luke, and an Xwing to get out EBO. He also gets out Incom Corporation. My turn I Monnok lost him and get two X-wings. I see Lost in the Wilderness. I deploy Emperor and Janus to the race arena and I No Escape to get my Monnok back. I also deploy Visage to the Conference Room. He gets out Hoth and puts an X-wing there. I deploy Brangus and I don&#146;t stack my race destinies for the next few turns, I just lose to his drain of 3 and we both lose to Visage. He puts an X-wing to my Alderaan and now he&#146;s draining for total of 5. I win the race now, I retrieve 11, he loses 11. He gets out Kashyyyk, puts an Xwing there and moves the one from Alderaan there. On my turn I Lateral Damage one of the Xwings and then I let him go. I am not draining at the Podrace Arena for fear of Lost in the Wilderness. He goes and I Counter Assault his Kashyyyk drain. I draw a six and a five and he loses 7. I then drop Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to Hoth and both sides die and then Visage damage along with Monnok at the Holotable kill him as I keep getting back my Control/Set For Stun back with Brangus. I win by 17.<br>
FW 2(+17)<br>
Highlights: Counter Assault and finally winning with this deck <br>
Lowlights: None <br>
<br>
After this we have a lunch break. Andrew and me wander around with the Wantagh people looking for food. Outside we find a hotdog place but the lady is like stupid. They had no ice or cherry coke. <br>
<br>
Game 2: My HBX Vs Pat Howlett&#146;s (1535) TTO<br>
Well I have never seen him before. He played Andrew in game 1 and won by I think 20. He starts Endor and Operational As Planned to get Jerjerrod, Death Star II, and We&#146;ll Double Our Efforts. We race and I draw high I think. He deploys his big ball thingy and on my turn I convert his Endor and deploy S-foils. I move some X-wings to Endor from Rendezvous Point. He deploys Dengar in ship and battles he thinks he can add 2 to his battle destiny even though he has no draw. Well on my turn I kill him with some X-wings and he loses 10 overflow. He gets out Jerjerrod on the Visage and pulls stuff but I think I barrier him. I get out my systems and I slow the race down. I start to spread out and he has Vader with Saber at the DSII db draining for 1 and he has Bossk somewhere with a Death Squadron Stardestroyer and Jerjerrod and the Visage are out somewhere too. Well I flip and win the race and use I Did It to retrieve 4. I run aroun and cancel his drains. I land X-wings to the Podrace arena to get more out of I Did It. I then drain him out and get in some All Wings retrieval. I win by 36.<br>
FW 4(+53)<br>
Highligts: Winning I guess<br>
Lowlights: He seemed like a new player, he didn&#146;t know all the rules and the game might have been different without his Dengar getting killed and he lost a sector in the overflow I think<br>
<br>
Well now I am paired with Ehrhart, he won his first two games by over 35. Andrew just lost to one of Waynes cousins<br>
<br>
Game 3: My Brangus I suck deck Vs. Matt Ehrhart&#146;s (1947) RST Racing<br>
Well he starts the racing stuff and Strike Planning and I get out my usual. I pay 2 with Sebulba and I draw a 5. I get out the Holotable and the War Room. He deploys The Shield Is Down from hand and draws. I draw high for the race again as does he. He tries to blow up the Holotable but I stop that with This Is Some Rescue. He gets out Corran and Jedi Luke to the Bunker. EPP Vader comes down and I try to Set For Stun Corran but miss with a 3. I battle and play I Have You Now and everyone dies. The race goes on and I grab his A Step Backward. No bad stuff happens. He has A Step Backward stacked on his racer along with two other fives. I play Racer Collision and what card do I pick? Yeah, A Step Backward. He plays it and I lose my stacked 7. He gets out Han, Orimaarko, and EPP Obi to the Bunker. He blows it up with two sixes and Throw Me Another Charge. I lose 8, he gets back 8, I lose my hand including my Racer Collision and my DS Docking bays. He then wins the race on turn 1 due to me drawing EPP Vader for race destiny. I lose 11 and he gets back 11. Now he spreads and drains. I lose now by 32.<br>
FL 4(+21)<br>
Highlights: It was sort of close but the race and the blowing up the bunker don&#146;t show that. It was his smallest win of the day<br>
Lowlights: Other than losing it was a fun game<br>
<br>
Well there are three undefeated people. Matt and both Greg and Brian Zinn. Andrew lost by 32 to Steve so he gets the bye.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My HBX Vs. Greg Zinn&#146;s (1534) Walker Garrison<br>
This is another one of Brad&#146;s friends. It is his second tournament and he beat me last tournament with the same deck. He sets up with Piett and Merrejk and pulls his system and gets out some sites. I pull Endor and move two X-wings there. I also get out Sfoils. He sets up with a walker at the Ice Plains. So far my race destinies are all fives except for 1. I pull more systems and stuff, activate Sfoils. He comes down with Chimaera and Thrawn and he battle and plays Imperial Command. He draws 1, 0, and 4 so I lose my two X-wings. At the end of his turn I play Organized Attack lost. On my turn five power 6 X-wings kill his ship plus 4 more. I start to ping him and he loses his space cards from hand I see. I start to spread as does he. I get out Quigon to the Podrace Arena and flip. He does 2 damage to me for YMSYL while I kill his drains. I win the race and retrieve alot and he loses alot. I use I Did It to retrieve. He can&#146;t draw up so I win by 30.<br>
FW 6(+51)<br>
Highlights: I got revenge for the loss he gave me last tournament, I also beat up Thrawn and Chimaera<br>
Lowlights: None<br>
<br>
The tournament is over now. Matt won first with 8(+142).<br>
Top 4:<br>
1. Matt Ehrhart<br>
2. Chris Wo@#$%a (me)<br>
3. Alex Warshow<br>
4. Wayne Cullen<br>
<br>
Andrew got 15th. Prizes were not too great. I picked foil S&amp;V and a foil Ewok Glider. Andrew got foils of Haven, Kiffex, that wolfguy from the OTSD, and some other sucky thing. I trade some crap Endor/DS II rares to Pat Howlett for an AI Aurra (I traded my Aurra last tournament). He was trying to complete his set I think I gave him I&#146;m With You Too, That&#146;s One, Emperor&#146;s Sword, Force Lightning, and some other rare I would never use. I also trade Sam Diamond a Meditation Chamber and I finally get a DS Coruscant. I give Andrew my extra Tarkin and he gives me some Voyuers and CC Sabacc&#146;s (I own 3 of those). I buy a Hoth two player thing before I go home. He had fun and I hope he keeps trying to get better and comes to the next tournament with me on the 11th. <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Brad: Good job as TD<br>
Matt: Good game (I think) and congrats on 1st with your amazing differential<br>
Alex: Slower deal, hell yeah<br>
Steve: Placing Palpy out of play vs BHBM and you used RTP, hahahaha<br>
Pete: Rops is dead but you still used it and you made it in the car<br>
Wayne: Good job at 4th, it was you best finish ever<br>
Zinn brothers: Both undefeated after game 3 in their 2nd ever tournament<br>
Jon Grubb: Why not.....<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me: Too lazy to build my BHBM<br>
Mastic people: C&#146;mon, I would have liked to see Ehrhart vs Pipitone or Curran<br>
<br>
I&#146;m done now. I think my rating should jump back up to my 1665 so I might not be so sucky anymore. I will have to take apart my decks now and get ready for Coruscant. Next Tri-county tournament is the 11th and I hear Grasshoppers might get some tournaments again. <br>
