Many american travel up to here in Ottawa to come and try to get the GS title.  Some of the big names that showed up where, Clint Hays, Brian Terwilliger, Matt Sokol, Jonathan Chu, Steve Brentson, Yannick Lapointe. (those were the people with a rating over 2000)<br>
<br>
In a matter of fact, it look that in person the player from Quebec and United state are much more friendly then on this web site, which I really appreciated since it was cool to see some nice people that I've only saw once or twice (in major convention). I was going with my Dagobah Undeafeated deck with a few modification (see in my decktech archive)and a regular ralltir deck using a few walker and at-st. <br>
<br>
The event was organise by a old gay men.  I mean, he screw up our regional last year and he came back again for this Grand slam event.  He is a store owner of a Cards shop named Kool Kard Heaven.  This guy pass most of is time to yell at players and even after Brian Terwilliger because he refuse to take is Jedi pack and a Poster.  I must say that this event helped uniting all people from all region to confront that bastard.  I personnally like when I said to him in french (this guy also speak french so he really understand me). You s*ck, eat sh*t, Looser, Federalist, Scrub, Canadian sh*t, one day you will be proud, and this will be the day you will pass to the Quebec side... etc.  And overall, this guy charged us 12$ to play in the SWCCG event and it was 12$ more for the YJ Event (which only attracted 12 people I think)<br>
<br>
Overall there was 38 people competing in the SWCCG event. (10 from Montreal, near 10 from U.S.A, 6 from Toronto Area and the rest from Ottawa area). On to the game now...<br>
<br>
1st- Light vs Martin Leblanc (1616 - Hull) Ralltir choke<br>
<br>
The game started slowly since he was getting is site and putting some sleen to each of those site.  I was doing my testing during that time.  And he was receiving a few damage from visored visio and anger fear agression during that time.  Finnaly he deploy 3 at-st pilot in 3 at-st and flipped.  I didn't had to do much until he got a few system out ans start draining.  ÉUnfortunatly, I only have 2 ship in that deck and non seem to come out.  He was only paying one to drain for each system, so I could hurt him much with visored svision and Anger fear agression.  I finnaly put a starship in front of him and start blocking a few drain. I also played many It could be worse to cancel some drains, until he grabbed it.  He also came down with Boosk in Hound tooth with vader and a non unique at-st.  He cancelled my stone piles and kill Leai (suspending Jedi test( no other lei in deck anyway). I was able to kill vader and the ship before he started to drain me with is scout on dagobah.  But in the late game I arrive with a few character on Ralltir to kill some of his at-st and flip back. I started to drain on is ralltir site and the falcon to ralltir.  Got lucky in this one and finally won by 4.<br>
<br>
Game result 2 (+4)<br>
Overall:    2 (+4)<br>
<br>
Game 2- Dark vs Steve Brentson (2023, CT, USA) Spedder ops)<br>
<br>
I was the lowest player with a win so I was playing the highest player from the deafeated players.<br>
<br>
He started real fast by deploing many operative with speeder to is planet and flip pretty early.  But I had a good starting hand with a walker and vader tarkin.  I wasn't able to flip my objective until late this game since I needed my character on is planet to make some beatdown.  So I manage to make him some battle damage when I deployed DLOTS / tarkin agaisnt a Ithorian, a operative and a Guy who make speeder immune.  Battle, choked is operative, cancel is destiny with tarkin and he was down by alot and suffer 12 battle damage. after this he started to deply everywhere and start draining like crazy, sut since I played Battle order in starting efffect, he couldn't do much drawing since he was always using is force to drain.  I finally deploy 3 imperial to ralltir and flip, reducing is drain to 1 for each site.  He did deploy a botan spy on is desert site to reduce my drain to Bottawui, but I played a sandwhirl on it.  It really help me out since I was draining only for 2 a turn, nor for 3.  I started to control the game after this and I won by 14<br>
<br>
Game result 2 (+14)<br>
Overall     4 (+18)<br>
<br>
Game 3- Dark vs Eric Paquin (Montreal, 1725) Profit<br>
<br>
There is really not much to say.  I made a mistake by pulling Secret plan as a starting effect instead of IAO.  I did flip pretty soon but a nasty nabruind lead with Ben/ han, Master and leai combine with a few destiny adder killed my 3 imperial with 13 more forces.  Having nothing more in hand I had to draw many turn while suferring from drain and objective damage.  I got a few character and start deploying them on tatooine since all is characters where on ralltir.  So I was drain for a few (and I had to split my force) but Lando ECC and Chewie killed some of my characters and do some more battle damage.  After that he started harvesting and that was game.  Full lost by 25<br>
<br>
Game result 0 (-25)<br>
Overall     4 (-7)<br>
<br>
Needless to say that I was the lowest player with 2 wins.<br>
<br>
Game 4- Light vs Patrick Chow (Toronto- 1629) HDADTJ duel.<br>
<br>
As I can see is used pile with Polarised negative coupling, I saw he wasn't playing real high destiny.  So I cancelled his visage on turn 1 and make him suffer with a few anger and visored vision during the first few turn.  After this he deploy a few tatooine site and I was bloking is drain with the help of undercover spies and Projection of a skywalker.  He wasn't doing me any damage and wasn't activating, so I coulnd do nothing.  So I decided to deploy on The executor for some draining (didn't bring luke, ben becaus is objective was flipped.  He deployed U-3po but didn't keep any force, so I move my 4 character to the other executor site and start draining.  So he finnaly deploy another visage with zukuss on holothater to make me a few damage.   But I deployed Uncontrollable fury when I just saw that he lost a you are beaten from hand and a luke to a tatooine site which wasn't occupied.  So fianlly he decided to move is vcader to same site as luke and make a Vader obcession duel.  He played focused attack and draw 3 destiny + 3 using vader epp.I was surprise of his draw cause tracking is quite easu with the help of NPC. he drew 1-1-1 to my 3 and 4 . SO I won the duel and that was game.<br>
<br>
Game result 2 (+14)<br>
Overall     6 (+7)<br>
<br>
Game 5- Dark vs Alexander Alami (Vancouver- 1815) Profit<br>
<br>
I wouldn't get caught twice with nabruind lead, so I started IAO.  We didn't do much in the first few turn, we examine ourself a few turn until he deployed boussh, brewak cover with her gun and orrimako to ralltir.  So Now I have to clean them up if I want to flip my objective.  Which I did with a single DVDLOTS.  I battle them, used my first action to choke leai (6 torture) and make her lose gun and meditation. Leaving orrimakko which he draw a 0 and I drew a 4.  14 to 4, he have to lose 5 more.  After I flipped and start draining in space and on raltir.  He did came a few time to fight but my bonus of destiny manage to take is characters down.  I taugh I was ok , when I deployed a bubo vs. alone Han solo but when the creature battle he played a fallen protal :( so Objective didn't flips back.  My drain vs is objective finnaly caugh him and I win this game by .. guess what... 14.<br>
<br>
Game result 2 (+14)<br>
Overall     8 (+21)<br>
<br>
Game 6- Light vs Clint Hays (TN, USA - 2101)<br>
<br>
He started with death star vs my dagobah.  I got yoda out and start training with DOS. I manage to make him loose 20 cards with the help of Anger fear agreesion and Visiored vision and this early in the game.  He got yavin docking bay out and put some walker on it.  So I deployed luke, Obi and orrimako and battle.  He lost some character +2 forces because of orrimako.  Everything stayed on table since yoda whaas reducing attrtion by 2.  He did deployed over and over with Tempest 1 and Blizzard 2.  but all my character were standing tall agaisnt those huge walker.  Finnaly luke fall dow to one of them when he drew a 5 of destiny.  But ben and Orrimako where convinced to killed to walker for the good of the rebellion.  I finnaly cleared the site out making him loose some addiotion force with orrimako.  Now he had to pay 4 for is drain in space.  Which he did but I was playing It could be worse to always prevent the force loss.  There was nonthing much he could do and Ifinnaly killed him with my drain of one on ysving Docking bay and with some more anger fear agression.  He never wanted to deploy Vader since he didn't have any clash of saber and he say my hand while making a monok lost for 6.  I won that game without much trouble.<br>
<br>
Game result 2 (+17)<br>
Overall     10 (+38)<br>
<br>
<br>
So here are the final standing<br>
<br>
Alex Klamroth 10 (+97) Montreal, Quebec<br>
Yannick Lapointe 10 (+93) Laval, Quebec<br>
