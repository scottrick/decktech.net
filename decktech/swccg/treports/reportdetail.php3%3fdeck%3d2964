Friday, 9/14/01:<br>
I got out of school around 2:15, and quickly hurried over to Milford, with My great friend Matt Scott. This was going to be Matt Ss last day home, as he was leaving for college Saturday afternoon. I had not played a game of Star Wars since my last tourney 3 weeks ago. My rating after that tourney was 1707. I am very happy with this rating, since my goal all summer was to break 1700 with my 1546 rating at the start of the summer. I was expecting some games of starwars and playtesting, but my hopes were to no avail. AJ had to cut his grass, and Matt and me just hung out preparing for his departure to Ohio State. Then at 6:00 pm, we had to drop off our favorite little statpersons Tyler and AJ at the Milford HS football game. Matt and I went out to McDonalds then to the Milford Game. At this Milford Game, Matt S.s sister and her friends hideously hit on me. I was actually asked if my hands were warm so one of them could hold my hand, which I took away cause I did not find this girl very attractive. I also found out that Britney Bowles, matts neighbor thinks I look like the clumsy type that wouldn&amp;#8217;t know where my hands go and how to use all of my equipment. Britney I got 6 words for you, TRY ME YOU NO CHESTED WHORE. Milford Lost. The statboys messed up horribly and our night was basically filled with whines and cries from my favorite statboy. We stayed up till 2 working on stats, so again No SW FOR ME.<br>
<br>
Sat 9/15/01 9:13 am:<br>
We wake up. The stats were not yet completely fixed so we had to fix them once again. I watched In The Army Now, a great movie starring Paully Shore. Then We were off to a fun day at the local tourney scene.<br>
<br>
I was playing RST BoomRace, and My Ties! This tourney. They had proved worthy two tourney&amp;#8217;s in a row, so I felt confident. <br>
<br>
GAME I: My RST BOOMRACE vs. AJ Kleins (1740) Watto Piece of ASS.<br>
Well I felt worried since I had never played a watto deck and AJ usually beats me in Tournament games. Well I got an average start and got set up on Endor. He set up on Tat. And Flipped. There were never any battles or interaction at all this game, so I will pretty much skip to the end. I was down to exactly 16 cards. I then finished the race with 10 destiny on my racer. I retrieved 6 and now I was +18 more cards. I then Blew the bunker and was now at 42 cards in reserve when he was down to just a little. He then force drained me a lot while I only force drained for 2 at back door and I like an Idiot kept on forgetting to save force. Home one never made an appearance and I could not get any characters to hold another site. So in the end I won this game by 17. I was ecstatic.<br>
FW 2 (+17)<br>
Highs: I beat AJ klein<br>
Lows: I hurt a friends feelings.<br>
<br>
*Insert boring 13 min sitting time here*<br>
<br>
GAME II: My Ties! vs. John Veasey (1549) WYS Piece of ASS<br>
Well, well, well. I get to play the man from above, the beast, JOHN VEASEY. His rating right now sucks, since he is a great player. He should be atleast in the high 1600s/low 1700s. well game starts rather bad. I get 2 systems and 2 ties, but no sienar and Dont  do that again is on table. I deploy both ties and then he goes. He draws and lets me go. I just get out wakee, and twilek for sienar then he goes. He deploys Wedge in ship to Tat, then moves over to Wakee so that my ties deploy +4. I go and draw some. He deploys Outrider to space and moves it to Naboo. His obj is still not flipped. I deploy a beatdown of ties al at +4 and in the end win by 18 only to be Houjixed all away. Damn @#$%ter piece of @#$%. I then let him go. He does some shiz and still does not flip and then it is my turn. I deploy some ties to wakee, beat him in the battle by 8 he loses 4 cause of lat damn and I am happy. He goes and gets back in space with outrider and Red 10. I go. Deploy my last tie. And then like an idiot (not seeing his X-Wing cannon, move over to the system to battle cause I gotta cannon.) well this happens he does battle I lose ship with cannon and battle and all cards there are gone. I deploy some more shiz and try to satisfy my his battle plan. He then moves over to Death Star to drain for 3 and I can no longer reach him. I am screwed. I end up wiping him off of all battle grounds but the game gets down to the wire. He force drains me and I get a small drain off. I play short range. He does lotso @#$%. He ends up draining me out. I lose this game by 16.<br>
FL 2 (+1)<br>
Highs: AHHHHHHHH PISS.<br>
Lows: I sucked against this space WYS.<br>
<br>
@#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% @#$% and more @#$%. Any way onto my next game<br>
<br>
Game III: My Ties! vs. Tyler Martin (1837) Wys Bottomly Piece of ASS.<br>
Well now I gotta play by far the best player at ACME today. His rating is worlds above everybody else. I feel rather screwed. Then I get clear in my thoughts and Think that I can beat this kid. I get a ok start and get set up in space. He takes a long time to get to space and mainly stays on the ground. He then goes to space. My first action is to clearly to do the beatdown I had been saving in my hand. I deploy Fighter cover, canceling his AO. I then deploy 4 ties, retrieving 4 force. I lat. Dam the outrider which was with the pulsar skate. I then Initiate a battle and play All power to weapons. *Humongobungo game breaking mistake* I then do what only a SWMoron does. I make the worst mistake in the book. I shoot down the Lat Damaged outrider completely forgetting. I then have 23 to his 9, winning by 14. with forfeit I think he had to lose like 4. This would have been 14 had I not been a complete and utter jackass of a man. I then let him go. The rest of the game consisted of a force drain war and my battle order stopping him from mass drainage and me from minimal drainage. I am draining for 6 he is draining for 9, the game gets very close and I end up losing by 3 to tyler marting. I should have won this game, but like every tourney I make one huge mistake which costs me big time.<br>
FL 2 (-2)<br>
<br>
O GOD I AM HORRID.<br>
<br>
GAME IV: RST BOOMRACE vs. Tyler Martin (1837) gay @#$% shiz sabbac dark deal Piece of ASS.<br>
I do not want to write this game. This was the worst game of Star Wars ever played. It was so completely gay that I do not even want to get into it. There was like 1 battle on cloud city with Obi and Qui gon late game after all of my retrieval and such. I had my characters at landing site and back door draining for 5. He then proceeded to get a perfect sabacc 10 times in a row retrieving around 30 force and making me lose 20 force. I completely hated this game, and could not believe the gayness of that deck. I am sorry tyler but I hate your deck. Please make a fun deck next time. I end the game losing by 21.<br>
FL 2 (-23)<br>
Highs: none<br>
Lows: this is the type of stuff that makes me hate Star Wars.<br>
<br>
Anyway, during this break we invent the word @#$%orito and try to make up stuff that we could use the word. (ex. Burrito is now a @#$%urrito.)<br>
<br>
Game V: RST BOOMRACE vs. Matt Rheude (1453) Lotti Doddi only good with Mike Gemme Piece of ASS.<br>
Well he starts like he should but does not get a first turn flip. Instead he defensive fires during his turn, gets something, then Scanning crews, gets luke, then during my turn defensive fires and gets Gen Solo. I had gotten gen solo in my opening hand though so I knew I could get it back with Strike planning. I deploy crix, leia, and kensaric. He goes. I am now winnign the podrace 10-0. yippee Kay yie yay mutha fukca. He deploys Lotti Doddi and flips. He gets out a political effect and lets me go. I get out solo, then comes def. Fire, and since solo is a foil he looks at my hand until he can decide which one is him and then gets him once again. That I think Is gay right there. I then deploy bunker and deactivate, and blunt, and charge, move over and sit there. I do not yet have the shield is down, which I can not seem to find. He goes. I now have 5 cards in my hand so I am basically fukced. He uses his obj and def to put back three, then plays limited and I lose 4. He luckily has not gotten I Did It! Yet.  I then go. I get out the shield is down and save 6 force drawing the rest. I get a 5 and a 5 for race destiny finally putting me over. He uses some stuff and puts stuff back but I Did It stays luckily, or unluckily for him. I then win the race and have 8 race destiny plus 6 force back. He loses 6 and then I go. I draw to deactivate, and I get a 6 and a&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;. 1. nice I completely missed. I drain for one, use Launching to get out Home one, and then deploy it on Rendili, because he controlled Endor with Zuckuss and Dengar. He goes, deploys vader and mara to bunker and battles, Obi hits vader with a 5, hehehe. Insight rocks. He loses both and 3. I go, attempt to send the charges away, and I get a 5,5. yay. I flip retrieve 8 he loses 8. I then let him go. He goes and moves Dengar and Zuckuss over, not smart, and puts his force back. He plays squabbling to retrieve 3. I deploy EPP Leia, Ackbar, and LSJK on home one and battle. He loses everything, I lose leia. That was fun. I did retrieval, scout retrieval, then drain for 5 for the rest of the game do him in. I win by 25.<br>
FW 4 (+2)<br>
Highs: I love boomrace<br>
Lows: limited resource is gay.<br>
<br>
I was then rather happy, so whenever anyone asked me a question I responded with, I LIKE EGGS!!!!<br>
<br>
GAME VI: My Ties! vs. Toby Geltner (1436) Klatooninan rav @#$% Piece of ASS.<br>
Well he starts and Jar Jar is his rep. I get out a system, and one tie, wakee, and sienar, and 2 uc&amp;#8217;s in my opening hand. I draw the rest and get 3 more ties and 1 more system. He goes and deploys a gift and some stuff at the chamber and I go. I drain for 2, then deploy my other tie, then use Neimoidian to get out endor and deploy Emp. Shield. He goes. He deploys some stuff to antechamber. I go. I deploy Arica, shes put back in my hand with the Imp crasher. I then deploy U-3p0. I drained for 6. He goes. He deploys a monk and mercenary to there, with tessek on table then lets me go. drain. I deploy arica, sent back, then Kooter The Pink. He is locked down. I then let him go. He deploys some stuff to ante chamber, and lets me go. Drain. I deploy arica, sent back. I then am pissed so I decided to pump up the diff. I decided to not deploy arica, and just lose excess cards in my hand with just enough to retrieve after force drain canceler and tie retrieval. I use shortrange to get a tie, and he goes. Drain for 2, I lose it from hand (ghhk x2) I go. Drain for 4 only but 2 after he cancels with non unique alien. I deploy Arica to desert heart or whatever and let him go. I cancel his one drain, and the he lets me go. I deploy tie and retrieve 1. I now have 1 card in lost pile. He goes. I cancel his drain with other tie. I go. Drain for 2 more after he cancels. Deploy other tie, lost pile empty. He goes and drains me for 2. I lose it. I then go and drain for only 2 more again. He goes and Drains, canceled, I go deploy tie, 1 card in lost pile. I go drain for 6 total. Hes down to 5. he goes drains, canceled. I deploy the last tie and empty lost pile, and now have no cards in hand except for one tie which I drew since I&amp;#8217;d have to lose 2. I cancel, then next turn drain him out to win the game by 39. yay for me.<br>
FW 6 (+41)<br>
Highs: In and Outta lockdown, I dont gotta job now.<br>
Lows: none at all<br>
<br>
Well I pretty much did mediocre. I waited for all the games to end, and found out that I got 3rd, since I had the highest 3-3 diff. Yay I guess. Well here are the standings:<br>
<br>
1.	Tyler Martin<br>
