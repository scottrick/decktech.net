The Avs in Seven, @#$%!<br>
<br>
After my 5-1 Victory the night before I blew off making new decks and just teched out the Dark Deal deck against QMC since I thought I would be seeing a lot of that in day 2.  I left the Profit Deck alone cause Profit is the @#$%.  So after some pizza and some Sportscenter in my room I fell asleep eagerly anticipating the next day where I might win a tourney and watch my Avs . . . Win in 7.<br>
<br>
I woke the next day at like 8:30 and got ready to lay the beats at noon.  I took in a breakfast brunch at the local buffet, mmmm scramby eggs, and then I went into the dealers room and bought my first ever hoth 2-player set so I could now actually make a YMSYL deck.  John Arendt rolls into the playing area at about 10:30 and I play my Profit deck against his space/anti-QMC deck.  After that game I see Peter Cole wake his arse up, note that Tom Meade will not be playing in this tourney since he is a scrub and needs to take his ACTs, thank Christ, I&amp;#8217;ve only played Tom in my last 8 tournaments, this would finally break the streak!!  Scott Gaeta is running the show and I think we start off with 24 or something like that.  John Arendt, Chris Fanchi, and Tim McKnight are the big sharks here at the start.  <br>
<br>
Game 1 <br>
Joe Helfrich (1759) RST Explosion vs. Dark Deal minus Imperial Barrier <br>
Joe has been in this game for a long time and his knowledge of the rules is like none other, but in my career I have never lost to him, so it is look all gooood for me.  I show him my Objective, TDIGW, and he says, &amp;#8220;Oh you are playing Dark Deal, that means I have to invade and stop you from playing the Deal&amp;#8221; could not have been said better ; ) Well he starts Strike Planning, The Shield is Down, and SAC Prot.  I&amp;#8217;m kind of interested to play thus game cause I haven&amp;#8217;t played against this deck yet, like I said before I hadn&amp;#8217;t done too much Tatooine play testing.  So I play my locations and draw, he deploys both his Generals to the Landing Site along with some scout Scrub.  On my turn I play Scout Killa Vader w/ stick along with 4Lom to the Landing Site, I grab the Crush interrupt and Battle him.  I Choke the Scrub, I swing and hit Han, I play I have you know and get jank destiny but I clear the site, he draws low destiny so I lose 4Lom but I have Choke Vader w/ stick at the Landing site.  His turn he draws up, my turn I drain 3 with Vader, that site will be uncontested the rest of the game, so every turn I&amp;#8217;m draining 3 on Endor, On my turn I pick up cards looking to set up the Deal.  He picks up cards looking to blow up the bunker, He gets a team with Corran Horn and invades the Bunker, and plays 2 Detonators.  While he fudges around there I play Palpy and Janus up to my 2/2 site on CC and Set Maul w/ Stick up at a site, I then decide I need to keep him from blowing up the bunker before I set up the deal So I drop the DS Scrub Aurra Sing knowing that I can Ghhk her, but I did not see Jose&amp;#8217;s play coming like this.  Joe decides he&amp;#8217;s going to make me pay for putting Aurra&amp;#8217;s there, HAH, so he plays Luke and Qui-on Jin in the Bunker (Refer to Joe&amp;#8217;s Quote Earlier) He has 2 force left in his pile, he pays one to battle I then Projective Telepathy cause Vader says you Fools watch me drain you for 3!  On my Turn I play some ships to Bespin and I get the Occupation out.  On Joe&amp;#8217;s Turn he continues to want to kill my Aurra Since So he deploys General Han and Chewie of Kashyyk.  He Battles swings at Aurra&amp;#8217;s hits, draws a 4 for destiny and he cancels my 1, ohhhh no I lose by 40 . . . Wait a second where did I leave my Ghhk?  Oh its in my hand!!!!  It is all Gooood!  I Ghhk the 40 battle damage and he gives me my turn, I hit him for like 10 force in my control phase and then I set up the Deal and flip.  He now has the Bunker all to himself so he tries to blow it up, But Han realizes that the Death Star isn&amp;#8217;t actually on the table and Joe only draws a 1 and a 2, yay for the Empire!  They keep there Forest resort on Endor.  My next turn I hit Joe for like 20 cause of the deal and I get a full win by 21 . . . It is all gooood!<br>
<br>
2 +21<br>
Highs: Many this Game, Dark Lord Skull @#$%ing the Generals, Aurra Sing Getting Skull @#$%ed by every light side main (but she brought protection, yummy!), and Dealing on Joe for 20!<br>
Lows: Just beating Joe Senseless pretty much, he didn&amp;#8217;t really do anything to me, I just used to many cards to beat him.<br>
<br>
Sooo the plot thickens, during game one it appears that Brian Hunter and Van Melancanon showed up to play SW too.  But seeing that they were late they had to play each other, so poor Van would start the day off losing to a guy who he play tests with 24-7.  So Me, John and Brian all won with Dark Decks which means that the Circle of Jesus is Now Complete since Jesus Jesus, John Jesus, and Qui-Gon Jesus were all in the same Tournament.  It was all gooood!!<br>
<br>
Game 2 <br>
Karl Ayres (1528) BHBM Ties vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es<br>
Karl is from team Greeley which consistently plays space, so this should be an easy game since I run no space in my Profit, and Profit does really  good when there are no battles : P  Karl starts with Battle Order, Mob Points, and some meaning less effect, I Start Aim High since it will slow down his retrieval.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t have a Pod Racer Either so I am home free, that is 6 Free Force for me and he loses 6 force for no reason.  There isn&amp;#8217;t too much to talk about this Game, I Spring Han real Early to make him lose Force and I also pay three for some solid Drains, I get the Cantina and a Jedi w/ Stick there to Drain for 3 and I&amp;#8217;m Draining for 2 in the Palace so he&amp;#8217;s losing 7 a turn to my @#$%es.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t actually have a  Vader in his Deck, he just made the Emperor&amp;#8217;s Throne spy proof so I will leave that uncontested, on about the 3rd turn of the Game I lost Grimtaashed Karl for like 8 Cards since he plays a lot of multiples in this deck, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty sad match up for Karl I win by 38.<br>
<br>
4 +59 All Gooood!!<br>
Highs: Lost Grimtaash for 8, that is all gooood!<br>
Lows: Beating a good guy down by so much, but this was the first time I have played his BHBM Ties.<br>
<br>
Yep, 4 +59 and John and Brian are that this Tournament, that means that I am gonna lose to one of them this next Round.  <br>
<br>
Game 3 John Arendt (2122, 10th in the World) RST Explosion vs. Dark Deal minus Imperial Barrier<br>
Right, I don&amp;#8217;t need to say anything about this guy, he is an amazing player, hence I am screwed.  I know John loves Endor decks, and he does them very well so I&amp;#8217;m for some heat here, and I know I can&amp;#8217;t play John like I played Joe.  He has the standard start as do I.  We both begin to set up our respected systems, I have a real good hand, but I won&amp;#8217;t dare try to bust up the General monopoly on Endor since I&amp;#8217;m afraid of Obscure John Arendt Tech &lt;OJAT(tm)&gt;. So I start to Set up on CC playing Igar in Tempest One to the 2/2 Site hoping that a drain of 2 there and a Tie at the CC Sector can hurt him a little bit.  He deploys some people to disrupt my Set Up on CC like a Jedi Like w/ Stick and I have to use my tools to kick him off, which in turn make me lose cards, the early part of the game is extremely indecisive.  But John is working on the Bunker and He has a +4 to blow it up on his next turn so I decide I need to dump my Hand before he blows it up, and make my big play.  So On my Turn I think I activated 15 plus what I saved  and I dropped Palpy and Janus to a CC location and Dengar and Zuckuss in ship to Bespin, where I had Bobba Fett in Ship already.  So I occupy two CC sites, one with Palpy and Janus, the other with Tempest One w/ Igar, and 4 Lom, so I drop the CC Occupation.  I have 5 cards in hand as I prepare for the worst.  On his turn he tries to blow up the Bunker but he fails, So I have a turn to do some more damage to him, that he&amp;#8217;ll just retrieve.  On my turn I hit him for 8 I think, so he&amp;#8217;ll just retrieve that next turn.  So he blows up the Bunker and he Retrieves 8.  He then Comes up to CC with some Character to kill of Janus to stop a 2 drain, he also Drains me for 2 and the back door.  On my turn I drain and damage and  pick up cards.  Next turn John decides that the Occupation has got to go,  so he comes to Bespin with Home One w/ Ackbar and Theneespi . . . This is bad for me, but he cannot battle since I Projective Telepathy on him.  He should be able to make me lose 2 ships on his turn and then beat me down or I have to move this turn.   I use crush to look in my deck, there is a 6 a 5 and like 3 1&amp;#8217;s, not good.  I battle and I draw the 6! He draws a 4, So he loses Ackbar cause that&amp;#8217;s 7 attrition w/ Dengar there and I lose Zuckuss cause he still has 7 ability.  Its his Go, he drains me for 2 and I check my deck and the 6 is in there, I shuffle it up good and he cuts it.  He battles me I lose a force to First Strike and we flip destiny, and guess what . . . it&amp;#8217;s a 6, but he also gets a 6 so I lose Bobba Fett and he Loses Home one and Theneespi since the 6 was a 7 and Theneespi is like a 5 Forfeit.  I now have Board Control, but we are both low on force, I also have Battle Order on the Table.  I Hit john for about 6 and he gets me for 4 ( He played a Jedi Luke to the CC Carbon Chamber and I had no way to Stop it, Palpy can&amp;#8217;t move there and Igar would die like a fool) So it became a drain race, I was able to track a projective Telepathy to prevent a drain or 2 and I used Broken Concentration to keep him from getting force for the Order, and I squeak out the Victory by 3. It is all gooood!!!<br>
<br>
6 +62<br>
Highs: HOLY @#$%ING @#$%!!!!! I beat John Arendt in a tournament, that is kick ASS!!!! And to win by such a close Margin is God Level!!!  And I Top decked two 6&amp;#8217;s!!!1<br>
Lows:  Nah I was as high as a kite!!<br>
<br>
So after the upset I would have to play Brian Hunter, and I know I was gonna lose now, but that&amp;#8217;s ok since Brian is a good player, and a fun guy, I love to see his new decks in action so I know the future of Colorado Tech!<br>
<br>
Game 4 <br>
Brian Hunter (2301, 1st in the World) YMSYL vs. Pods, Profit and @#$%es<br>
So the first thing is I show him my Objective and we both agree that it is an Auto Win for him.  Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t it be?  Brian has NEVER EVER lost to Profit.  If you have read his TRs or his Deck Reports he says Profit is ASS.  So the Game Starts, he plays YMSYL, Mob Points, and IAO?  I give him the Goo Nee Tay for chagrins.  He does start a pod racer too so he can compete in the Race.  He starts off in Brian Hunter Fashion, fishes through his deck to establish his game, he play Admiral Piett to the Exec Docking Bay and Grabs Merrejick, which downloads a system.  On my Turn I do not have the Proper mains to hold Tatooine from a Brian Hunter Beat Down so I draw up, On Brian&amp;#8217;s turn he draws up . . . However too many cards 14 in fact so I hit with the Used Grimtaash since Brian isn&amp;#8217;t stupid, I know he don&amp;#8217;t play a lot of multiples.  Brian Continues to wet up he plays Fondor and a POTF and plays the executor, he sets up space control which is key to his deck, but I don not play space.  On my Next turn I play Ben and Lando to Spring Han and Flip, I retrieve like 4 from that cause he don&amp;#8217;t Have the plans out.  I try to alter his POTF but I draw a 6 for my alter draw, sweet I can tell where this game is going.  We both continue to set up out respective decks, I play Cantina and Get a Master Luke with Stick in there so I am draining.  But Brian is draining and setting up the walker DD on me.  We are both probably going about our decks the right way but I can&amp;#8217;t pout damage Brian, so I need to turn it up a notch, I play Qui-Gon with Stick and EPP Leia to the Palace, probably a big mistake since Brian can end me outside with a well placed walker beat down, but it never arrives.  My Pod Race Finally ends, every Destiny in Brian&amp;#8217;s deck is Pretty bad, so I win the race and he need to lose 6 force, and I have Force to retrieve so I get 6 more back.  On my next turn I retrieve 4 more from I did It and I deal damage to Brian, 9 to be exact and then it is his turn.  By now some of Brian&amp;#8217;s friends have come by and looked at the table and  seen the kinda @#$% that is going on, Van tells Brian to end me and play the Garrison but Brian is looking at the table and realizing that I pretty much have the game since I have a bigger deck. He then drops the I have never lost to Profit before Bomb on me, and I find out that we are both eating our words.  We continue to play he is able to make me lose like 13 in one turn but I retrieved too much by that point from the Pod Race, and other jank. I get the Full win, by 14.  It is all Goooood!!<br>
<br>
8 +74<br>
Highs: WOW, ok something is up I just beat John and Brian on the back to back jacks, this is either very good or very bad.  I am now 1-9 against Brian and 1-10 against John lifetime in sanctioned play ; )<br>
Lows: Nah, it is all gooood!!<br>
<br>
So Wow I&amp;#8217;m in first place for now, but John wants revenge on my dumb @#$% for Game 3 and he is playing the Anti-Profit deck . . . And I&amp;#8217;m sure the Karma Police are right around the corner!<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
John Arendt (2122) Maul&amp;#8217;s Palace vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es<br>
Hmmm Well this is the Anti-Profit deck John has been holding back on me, and I haven&amp;#8217;t really played against a good version of this yet either, so I&amp;#8217;m sure revenge is imminent.  So John starts the Landing Site and  the Palace and I give him Goo Nee Tay.  Now I am getting force Choked ASAP cause his set up is awesome, he even puts Mara and Xizor in the AC, so it is looking good for him, but leave it to Profit to be able to lay down the beats.  Like on turn 2 or three I&amp;#8217;m able to bring a massive Crew into the AC with a Bacta Tank on the Table.  I think I brought it with Ben, Jedi Luke, EJP Lando,  against his Xizor, Mara, and Iggy w/ Gun.  I battled and Excluded Iggy from battle with Lando I then Hit Mara with a light Saber and Hit Xizor with a stick too.  I flipped real high destiny and he flipped low, so he had to lose 17 force real early.  Next Turn he came down with Maul and Stick and battled he swung with Maul at Ben and hit and I missed his Maul.  I excluded Iggy so he wouldn&amp;#8217;t Snag Lando and I get Iggy out, I swing and Maul again and miss I draw destiny and it clears his site, and I lose Lando to the Tank and Ben is lost, but I have Luke at the AS with a damn droid on the other side. I win the Pod Race at the end of his turn so I say @#$% it, I&amp;#8217;ll pop Han and retrieve 10 force and then retrieve 6 for the Race.  So at the end of Johns turn I have like 45 force in my deck and John has around 16 total force between his deck and his hand.  This is when the tournament becomes not so good.  John pretty much looks at me and says &amp;#8220;Ya ya ya, you beat me and Brian today, Great Keen, Don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y!&amp;#8221;  However . . . I did get @#$%y, actually quite @#$%y.  I decide to not move my Luke and Han Away from the damn Droid cause I think I have John @#$%ed now, WRONG, on his turn he plays Guri with Iggy and Battles Luke and Han, Luke misses Iggy, and Iggy Snags Han, and he flips me back, I draw a 5 and that kills his Guri, and now John has my Han Solo captured by Iggy, aka a droid I cannot battle.  SO I am on my 0 side again, a la the side that say you cannot damage your opponent.  I don&amp;#8217;t really need to talk about the rest of the Game, I only have one way to kill Iggy and that is Sorry about the Mess, and when I do play that he senses it cause he has major sac.  So John is able to move away from my characters and Drain me for a lot every turn, and I can&amp;#8217;t do @#$% to him cause not only am I on 0 side but I&amp;#8217;m activating 7 force a turn, which is not enough to just beat down any of his forces in one instance.  So John widdles away at my massive life force while a Cannot do @#$% to him, it was quite embarrassing actually to see me lose a Game I pretty much had in the palm of my hands, then making a major error in &amp;#8220;strategy&amp;#8220;.  John ends up beating me by 12, cause he is an amazing player and I am a potzer.  <br>
<br>
8+62<br>
High: AC beat down for 17 is awwwwwesome!!!<br>
Lows: This game was a farce and embarrassment, but a major lesson . . .  Don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y against 2000+ Rated playas!<br>
<br>
So I still have a chance to win this if I have a majorly massive diff game, so lets see what happens shall we?<br>
<br>
Game 6 <br>
Fabrice Brugere (1500) @#$% Deck #99 vs. Dark Deal minus Imperial Barrier<br>
Ok first off this guy is French, secondly this is his first Tourney, so I get @#$%y here.  Lets refer to last game . . . Yep, I got @#$%y, lost that one.  SO the same thing will happen here, but not cause I made a mistake, because of  a tech mistake I made.  I will refer to the night before where I teched against QMC, well that6 means I took out a grabber and my SAC effect.  BIG MISTAKE KEEN!!!!  Now I will explain to you how I lost this game.  Fabrice starts Dejarik Holotable, and plays the Signal and plays Projection of a Skywalker on  it as the +1 drain bonus effect.  So I start off and set up Dark Deal.  On his turn he play Yoda&amp;#8217;s hut and Yoda.  On my turn I drain him.  On his turn he plays TK-422 to my Palpy.  I play more characters on my turn and  he plays Undercover spies a la Corran Horn, with an undercover on him and so on and so forth.  He is playing about 10 senses and 10 Alters in his deck apparently so I can&amp;#8217;t actually do anything to him, he also plays a Dejarik to the Table so he is draining me for 2, sweet.  So your thinking, why not set up the Occupation and do DD to him, well I did do that but he also plays about 10 It could be worse.  So Fabrice Brugere in his first Tourney played the best deck to play against my deck.  I could not Drain, I could not DD him, I could not Battle Him.  This is what I like to call Dagobah Star Wars, also know as the reason why I quit the game in 1997 cause  Dagobah was a GAY GAY GAY playing enviroment.  But I think it is awesome that some one can show up with a deck like that and still win in today&amp;#8217;s tech ; )  If I had interrupts to deal with his Undercover Spies, he sensed them so I couldn&amp;#8217;t do @#$%.  I ended up losing this game by 14 and I hope to God I never have to play this guy ever again!!!!<br>
<br>
8 +48<br>
Highs: No, none at all, oh wait, is it a high if I had the feeling to punch this French @#$% in the face multiple times?  (It a joke Buddy!)<br>
Lows: How embarrassing, beating two of the best in the world and then losing two games back to back in such terrible ways.  A definite learning experience.<br>
<br>
So by going 4 and 2 I was able to get 5th place at least, not to bad, but far from my Friday Performance.  Chris Fanchi actually got first place in this tourney, I think he beat John out for first, pretty impressive in my opinion even if Fanchi is still Parker Fodder ; )<br>
<br>
Prologue:<br>
After the &amp;#8220;culling of the blood&amp;#8221; the Avalanche game started and what a coincidence, we had a TV bar/lounge right next to the Tourney area so Me, John Arendt, Scott Gaeta, Tim McKnight, and Josiah watched the Avalanche skate to their Second Stanley Cup with like 100 screaming fans.  Not only that but the Bartender was not carding peeps so I did some illegal drinking, that guy can sure mix a @#$%ing Long island ; ) <br>
