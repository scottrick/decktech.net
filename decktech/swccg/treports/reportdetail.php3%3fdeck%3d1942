<br>
I had worked out my DS deck shortly after the last tourney, deciding to give my<br>
Hunt Down dueler a brather before the national in favour of a SYFCA Tie Interceptor<br>
deck with plenty of tech in (grav shadow, relentless pursuit etc). LS however was more<br>
of a problem (isn&#146;t it always?) I lacked some of the cards i wanted to build a WYS, so i <br>
decided to try something more radical. I started off trying TIGIH, but didnt like it. <br>
 As i have always wanted to build a speeder deck, and since they are practically unheard of<br>
in the UK, i decided to build an AITC speeder deck. After ordering some Rebel Speeders from <br>
my singles dealer, i realised it could do with retrieval, so i added a harvest pckage to it.<br>
I was kinda pissed i couldnt make it to the local practise club the monday b4 the tourney,<br>
so i played a few games online to test out the speeders, which did fairly well. I talked<br>
to Hayes on IM, and he really helped me refine, cheers man. Also talked with Chris Moore, <br>
one of my mates and someone we were hoping who could end Peter Di Biasio 5 tourney winning streak.<br>
He helps me refine it even more, and also tells me about his Tractor Beam SYFCA which sounded cool.<br>
<br>
*end pre tourney stuff*<br>
<br>
So the day comes and i get up early, get my stuff ready, and mum gives me a lift as usual. Im the <br>
first SW person there. People slowly trickle in, for SW and RD (the 2 big games around here). Andy<br>
Duncan buys a box of r2, gets a LV URF but not a lot else. Something to keep in mind is every pack of r1 <br>
the dealer has, all the CC cards are rare. So me and andy split 10 packs between us. I got a vaders Lightsaber<br>
foil and some chaff, while he gets farmboy, dlots, yoda, sos and commander luke foils. (I was not amused).<br>
In the end we get 14 people, and 2 people are on route.<br>
<br>
Decks: Harvestspeed: AITC Speeders with Harvest<br>
       Who Let The Ties out? SYFCA Tie Interceptor Beats<br>
<br>
Game 1: Harvestspeed vs Chris Moore (1873) Tractor Beam SYFCA<br>
<br>
DOOOOHHH! We know each others decks inside out, so this will be a drain race. I start Insurrection, Staging Areas, Yarna and DODN/Wa all 3 games,<br>
Chris starts mob pts, something special planned, and IAO.I get out my Hoth and Tat db&#146;s, <br>
while he sets up merrejk and ozzel at the ds db getting his systems out. I draw my judland wastes and <br>
lars moisture farm 3rd turn, his turn he puts down an unpiloted devastator at sullust to drain. My turn i deploy<br>
owen and beru to the farm, with a sandspeeder for backup, a sandspeeder at the judland wastes, 1 at the hutt trade route,<br>
and a rebel speeder at the db, plus deploy incom on hoth db. His turn he drains and draws up to find some stuff, and i play T47<br>
bat formation to hit him for a drain of 9. I deploy a couple of rebel speeders, so there are 2 speeders at every site except <br>
lars moisture farm. His turn he drains for 2, deploys the exexcutor and chireanau to endor, so that ups the drains to 6 a turn <br>
(i forgot chireaneau only adds to PILOTED SD&#146;s, so the devastator shouldnt have got the bonus burt on well, im a scrub ^_^). <br>
my turn i t47 again for another huge drain, and i harvest both of them back, so im ahead in the drain race now, but have more <br>
cards on the table so its about even. he drains for 6, and deploys GAT and the chimaera to kashyyyk, drains of 9 now, and i dont have a t47 in hand<br>
this turn. i drain for 5, deploy the backdoor and harvest some stuff back, 2 of my 3 harvests are now used. He drains for 9, and deploys epp vader, arica,<br>
and a couple of 2/2 guys at lars farm and battles, i react a couple of speeders over, he hits owen and beru, and i lose a rebel speeder to attrition, <br>
he loses a scrub. my drains are only 4 this turn, but i deploy civil disorder to keep the pressure on. We battle at the farm, i lose a speeder, while vader <br>
and the scrub die. he drains for 9 again, and deploys someone on the devastator to get round civil disorder. my turn i drain for 6, having picked up a t47 bat formation again.<br>
i deploy a lone sandspeeder at the backdoor, but he is ahead. He drains, deploys motti at the backdoor to get round civil dis and block my drain. i drain for 4, battle at the <br>
backdoor, kill motti, and he drains me out.<br>
<br>
Fl -6<br>
Highs: Really fun game, considering his deck had an advantage over mine.<br>
Lows: Having to play the only person who knew what my LS deck was.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Who Let The Ties out vs Nigel Lincoln (1474) Rescue The Princess<br>
<br>
I was kinda surprised when i saw his objective, he groaned when he saw mine. I start (in all games) TINT/Oppressive, Mob Pts and Something Special Planned, he signaled for Goo Nee Tay.<br>
I pull Milwaukee before we start, and have a god hand (merrejk, emperors shield, endor, SFS, twilek, a tie in, imp command and epp vader) I imp command to get piett asap, deploy <br>
milwaukee and endor and draw, getting chimaera and arica plus other stuff. He drops the detention block corridor (which i just realised his objective stops him doing) and draws. I <br>
draw a couple on my turn and say go. he drops han with gun and lando with axe at y4 db and starts across to get leia. I drop Chimaera with piett and merrejk at endor, merrejk <br>
fetches kashyyyk for me, i deploy SFS, and i twilek for dreaded imperial starfleet since i know hes gonna get some nice drains. He moves han and calrissian to the control room and frees leia, <br>
then she moves to join them. my go drain for 2, drop a dreadnaught and 2 tie ins (1 with a gun) to kashyyyk to really get the drains going. He drains for 4, i cancel it with dreaded imperial.<br>
he deploys protector chewie and corran, gives leia merc armour, and moves han and lando to the DB. My turn, drop epp vader to Leias group, Arica to lando and han, battle with vader, slice leia, <br>
and kill chewie with destiny, so only corran left. He moves corran over to break aricas cover and says go. I drain for 4, he loses 2 epp obis and epp luke ott. I add the executor with a tie at sullust,<br>
and hes running out of life force. arica runs away, and i just cancel the drain next turn. I retrieve my lost pile by deploying a vouple more ties, and drain him out.<br>
<br>
FW +22<br>
<br>
2+16<br>
<br>
Highs: pretty easy game<br>
Lows: Pretty non-interactive game<br>
<br>
Game3: Harvestspeed vs Andy Duncan&#146;s (1553) ISB Ops with hella Probe Droids.<br>
<br>
Andy hasnt played in awhile, so it was good to see him back. He starts Twilek for IAO (i think). 1st Turn he plops down hoth, 3rd and 5th marker and says go. I have a @#$%ty hand, 2 speeders, lars farm and <br>
some other stuff. I deploy the farm and draw, getting lando with axe, couple more speeders and flaps. He deploys normal sunsdown on hoth (not the combo, which was f***** crucial), deploys 5 free probe droids to<br>
3rd marker and a lone 1 to the 5th. I activate, lando with axe for free to 5th marker, 2 sandspeeders and a rebel speeder, deploy civil disorder and Order To Engage (which would haunt him for the rest of the game)<br>
and battle, he has about 15 overflow, which killed the game effectively. He drains next turn, and deploys a couple more droids, and loses to civil dis. i drain for 1, deploy another speeder, and move the speeder <br>
deploy draw their fire, and start whittling away at his probe droids. I exclude 1, and he loses 3 more from destiny + power differencial. His turn. more probes and mara (to get round civil dis), battle, i kill 2 <br>
probes after mara gets excluded by lando. He deploys palpy and janus at coruscant imperial square, and loses 3 to OTE. i deploy 2 more rebel speeders, and managed to clear out 5 probe droids this time. Its clear he&#146;s<br>
not gonna win, so he deploys a probe droid and lors vader with saber to the lars farm. I deploy a sandspeeder at the HTR, with a sandwhirl protecting it. I finally kill all the probe droids on hoth, and the speeders move to <br>
hoth db to start cornering vader. He drains for 4, i cancel with t47 battle formation :) he moves vader and probe droid to the db. My go, drain at HTR, sandwhirl goes to farm, my lot transit to tat db. He loses to civil dis and<br>
vader goes out in a blaze of glory, taking lando with him. my remaining speeders spread out on tat and do the t47 draining thing.<br>
<br>
FW +24<br>
Highs: That 2nd turn beatdown basically won me the game<br>
Lows: Him not having anything that could really make a comeback, only 2 characters besides probes were mara and vader.<br>
<br>
Game4: Who Let The Ties Out vs Peter Ashworth (1611) EBO<br>
<br>
for the record, we both played like complete numties this game, as you will soon see.<br>
He starts ANSB. I get an ok hand and pull milwaukee, and deploy sullust. i draw 1, play imp command for piett, the gits in my force pile, so i get thrawn instead. He activates, then remembers to use ANSB, pulls the corridor and war room.<br>
he deploys rebel fleet so i go on swarm alert. I get the Chimaera out at sullust again with piett on, grab merrejk but dont have force to deploy him this turn. He gets the db but ebos stuck in his force pile. He deploys a baragwin at every site plus incom corp, and <br>
draws for EBO. I figure this is gonna be a long,drawn out game. i get merrejk out, he fetches endor for me, and i finally find SFS. I draw a twilek, and get dreaded imp starfleet too. He converts my sullust (grrr), and deploys EBO, and puts 2 xwings <br>
each at 2 systems. I deploy 4 Tie Ins, 1 with a gun to 1 system, and bossk and zuckuss to the other. He tries to hyper escape away from the ties, ghhhk combo stops that, he had the force to react with spiral but forgot to. I blow away a tie, he houjixs <br>
the damage. He successfully hyper escapes away from zuckuss and bossk, to the death star,  i tried gravity shadowing an xwing, drew a 2 (doh). I follow with zuckuss and bossk to the death star, but font have any more force left to do anything else. He adds a couple <br>
more xwings at the D*, and kills bossk in the ensuing battle, while 2 xwings bite it. i drain, but dont have anything to reinforce zuckuss, so i battle, but only kill 1 xwing. I dont wanna run and have to take a drain of 5, and hes got only about 6 cards in hand, so i <br>
figure im safe. i draw into the ds assault squad, emperors sword, and executor. I figure im fine so long as zuckuss dont get beat up. I guess you can see whats coming. 2 xwings, lando in falcon, spiral, xwing cannon, battle, power pivot, 22 cards and the game :(<br>
<br>
FL- 15<br>
Highs: Not a lot<br>
Lows: Playing like a numpty<br>
<br>
Game 5: Harvestspeed vs Michael Rogers (1900 ish) Hunt Down.<br>
<br>
Nothing went right this game. He starts YCHF, Mob Pts and IAO. i get the lars farm down 1st turn, but no other locations all game. He doesnt have a clue what my deck is until he gets to verify 2nd turn when there isnt a db in my deck. i luckily got honor in oopening hand, so he <br>
loses to visage for 3 turns till he gets a vader. Lord V comes down with his saber at the d* db by himself, so i try and jump him with lando with axe and 2 speeders, after deploying incom. It goes very badly as i draw a 1 for BD, he draws a 6 and slices lando, so everything dies.<br>
Vader is joined by Dr e and ponda + tarkin for a drain of 2 which lasted the whole game. The 1st time he drains, 2 harvests go ott. I set up 2 speeders at each of the tat sites, hoping to do some t47 formation enhanced draining. He comes down with xizor, mara, dengar, janus, sim and Arnet!<br>
I lose about 15 cards. He starts draining for lots, and deploys no escape and search and destroy, so it will be over quick. I do get in a small moment of revenge, sandwhirling xizors crew at JP. im sorry i couldnt be more specific, but the game didnt last very long.<br>
<br>
FL -23<br>
<br>
Highs: Everyone going missing<br>
Lows: everything else<br>
<br>
I talk with michael a bit afterwards, he trades me a signal foil for a spare vader, so i was quite happy. We played a friendly with his WYS vs my Hunt Down, pretty close game, but we didnt finish it as the next round was annouced b4 we could.<br>
<br>
Game 6: Who Let The Ties Out Vs Andy Duncans EBOX<br>
<br>
he starts ANSB. Im looking forward to this, hopefully i can end on a win and break even. I get a god hand (sfs, dreaded, chimaera, merrejk, couple of ties and 2 aptw). I get wakeelmui down, and deploy merrejk straight to the SDb, to pull kashyyyk. He gets his 2 sites, incom and says go.<br>
I pull corulag, and draw into ties, relentless pursuit, and other evil things. I figure ill deploy wherever he does, cos im activating a buttload, and have lots of ships in hand. He gets the corridor, ebo, and deploys an incom engineer to all 3 echo sites to get ebo on the table. I just <br>
draw a couple, now having about 20 active. He gets coruscant, and deploys yavin 4 and mon calimari from hand, with 2 xwings at each of them. This is where i @#$% up big. I twilek for battle order, but forget to enforce the pay to drain bit all game, just getting free battles instead. I send the <br>
emperors sword and a tie interceptor with a cannon to coruscant, and zuckuss with a tie in to y4. the battle at coruscant sees a tie get shot, me play APTW, and him houjix the rather large amount of battle damage, while at y4 the xwings forfeit covers the damage.<br>
He grabs kessel and drops xwings there, at my endor, and at alderaan, and im having a hard time keeping up. I cancel a drain of 5, and eat another 5 while drawing to find additional ships. thankfully my drains at coruscant and y4 are giving him some damage. he moves the 2 xwings at alderaan to the d* to increase the hurt.<br>
In response, i drain and Thrawn gets on his SD armed with an imp command to go smash the cr@p outta the xwings, but he houjixs again. Same as whens the death star assault squad takes out the kessel problem. He keeps deploying xwings to any system i dont have stuff at, but my drains are really hurting. He never gets the chance to AWRI<br>
for retrieval, so im a fair bit ahead, thanks to SFS keeping my lost pile very small. 4 xwings go to a newly deployed hoth, so the chimaera starts moving there via kiffex, which i take over with bossk and dengar as soon as its deployed. I get off a drain of 8 next turn, to his canceled 3. The chimaera makes it to Hoth, and gets attacked <br>
by the 4xwings, plus organized attack. Thankfully my 3 destiny only make me lose a couple of cards. my go, drain, deploy 2 tie ins, 1 with a gun. Blow up 1 xwing, relentless pursuit another, draw a 5 and 6 for destiny, and this time theres no houjix. That gets him down very low, and i drain out.<br>
<br>
FW +24<br>
<br>
Highs: Fun, interactive game<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
afterwards I trade Andy my spare YAB foil that he didnt know existed for a Yoda Foil and force lightning foil, so im happy.<br>
<br>
Peter Di Biasio goes undefeated for the 5th straight tourney and wins yet again.<br>
