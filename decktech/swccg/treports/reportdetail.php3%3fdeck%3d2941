Anyway I am catching a ride down to Clarks Summit with Doug Faust to play in a tournament held by Pat Ziagos since he came up to my tournament to make it sanctioned. So I ended up staying up late on Saturday night(2:30ish) and then I got up at 6:50 cause we had to drive my brother to work(he works at Staples) at 8:00am but for some odd reason I didn&#146;t go with them(I can&#146;t remember)and around 8:30 I get a call from my brother asking me to check his work schedule to see if he is really supposed to be there at 8:00 which it does. But in the background I can here an alarm going off, I found out later Ben had looked in the window to see if anyone was there and he somehow tripped the alarm. The funny part is that it took the Ithaca Police Department 10 minutes to show up and even then they didn&#146;t get out of the car they just looked at the front of the store and then they got ready to leave but my brother told them what happened. So it thurns out that Ben was supposed to be on at n 9:00am. So my mom comes home at 9:00 and were head back downtown to the libaray where I am supposed to meet Doug in the parking lot. So 10:00 comes and passes and there is still no Doug so I am getting kinda worried but he finally shows up at 5 past. So I get in his car an we head off. The ride down is pretty uneventful I tell him about Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and we talk about Star Wars. He does about 80mph all the way down so we make pretty good time and get the at 11:45am. So anyway we start pretty much on time. I was too lazy to change my decks from last night so I am still playing Slave Quarter Mains and Hunt Down. My rating calculated from Sat is 1822. On to the games. <br>
<br>
Game 1: <br>
<br>
DS vs. Jude Mandarano&#146;s WYS(1671) <br>
This guy seems like a cool guy so we start out. I flip first turn and say go. He draws up all of his force looking for something. That&#146;s pretty much how it goes for the next couple turns because he really never does anything that I can play off of. I give Vader his saber and he tries to kill him with two scrub guys but I barrier 1 so he says go .I play Iggy with Gun and battle him. I capture 1 and cut the other so he dosen&#146;t get a battle destiny and he has to lose 9 force. Then he plays a Premiere Luke at the CC docking bay ad says go. So I throw down with Mara and her stick and Maul with stick and battle. he play Fallen Portal tracks a 5 and kills Maul (WTF) but Mara cuts him and we clear each other. A this point he is really to low to do much else so he draws hisx five force before I can get cards back into my deck. So I get the Full Win by 23 <br>
2(+23) <br>
Props: It was a good game considering he haden&#146;t bought much Curoscant <br>
Slops: Fallen Portal(dirty bastard) <br>
<br>
Game 2: <br>
<br>
LS vs Matthew Schultheis&#146;s Senate deck (1743) <br>
<br>
I have never played against a senate deck before so I have no idea how this game is going to go. On his first turn he plays a bunch of Interrupts from his hand including Defensive Fire So I know that he is playing a couple of Limited Resources. Anyway we stay away from eachother the almost the whole game the only BD sit he ever deploys a guy to is Emperor Palpatine to the Cantina which was a big mistake on his part because I Cantina&quot;shuffled&quot; Qui-Gon with his saber. I also deployed Corran Horn and Leia with Blaster against Dolty Dofain(sp?)on the Flagship bridge. I battled the emperor, cutting him so he had to lose 7 battle damage and then I fought with leia and corran shooting Dofain and causinf him 8 more battle damage. I started Harvesting and he got P-59 to the Jedi Council Chamber and drained me twice. But he drew up after he realized I will win by more if he keeps letting me retrieve. So I get the Full Win by 39. <br>
4(+62) <br>
<br>
Props: I won by 39 who could ask for more. <br>
<br>
Slops: none <br>
<br>
Game 3: <br>
DS vs Pat Ziagos&#146;s MWYHL test 6(1816)<br>
<br>
Yeah, I get to play Pat again. I had played him two times before yesterday and we only managed to get timed wins against eachother so this is probably going to be a loooong game but I am geared for it. I know that pat is most likely playing HOT Jedi so I start No Escapeto stop that little problem but I give up Mob Pts/YCHF. So we start. I get a god had. Lord Vader, Vader&#146;s Saber, Kuat, Executor:DB, plus some other stuff. So first turn I play the site and get the Could City:DB and play Vader to the Executor: DB and then shuttle to the CC:DB and flip. On Pats turn I find out that he is training Leia and that about all. My next turn I drop Death Star: DB with Mara and her saber. And then we pretty much keep going back and forth except I am causing him damage while he is not. Finally he plays Obi with saber at the DS:DB but he dosen&#146;y battle for some odd reason. SO on my turn I Disarm him and play Put All Sections On Alert so he dosen&#146;t get a Battle destiny.I miss the cut and draw low so he just losses Obi to the tank. Later he takes Obi back into his hand and plays him but I barrier(this is around test three or four so I need 6 or more to draw destiny). So on my trun I play Blizzard 2 and Tempest 1 and battle. Once again I miss the cut on Obi but then he play On The Edge and says 6 to try and kill Obi so he can avoid the battle damage, but he draws a 7 so he pays and retrieves his force. and then he takes 7 battle damage and I have to lose a walker and Mara(she got cut). Some more time goes on and I finally manage to get Maul out with his saber and The Phantom Menece at the CC:DB. Pat finally finishes his tests and draws two fours so he stacks a 4 At this point he really can&#146;t do anything. Most of the draws in his deck are low and him drawing two 4&#146;s for lightsaber swings won&#146;t kill my defense value 8 guys so I end up draining him out after a little while. I get the Full Win by 18.<br>
6(+80)<br>
<br>
Props:It was a good game. and defense value 8 guys<br>
<br>
Slops: None.<br>
<br>
Game 4:<br>
LS vs. Joseph Gagliardi&#146;s SYCFA(flip) (1910)<br>
<br>
Okay I know that this is going to be one big drain race because I have decks like this before so I know that I am going to have to hit hard and hit quick. I get some guys down to the Lar&#146;s Farm and start draining. HE drops a Kedar The Black but on my next turn I get Artoo down and play Double Agent to kill it and then OOC it. Oh and by the way I play 1 Control/Tunnel Vision. Then for the next couple of turns we get our stuff together. I play Mos Esiley and the Cantina while he flips. But he has no lost pile left(all OOCed) so he can&#146;t reterive any force. I have all my drain adder&#146;s out except for Obi&#146;s saber which I can&#146;t find so I play Conrtol/Tunnel Vision to get it(one). He is hitting me for a total drain of 12 while I am getting him for 9 but his deck is more card intensive so it is about even. Any way he tries to have U-3PO block the drain of 4 but it gets hit with Double Agent again. Anyway we kepth draining but my Harvest&#146;s were keeping me alive because I kept getting my conrtol back and then tracking it to block a drain I played it a total of five times(four blocking drains) I could have done it more but he had Something Special Planned For Them out So I could only play Harvest 4 times. So he buckled and I won by 10.<br>
8(+90)<br>
<br>
Props: Joe only getting to reterive three the whole game.<br>
<br>
Slops: After the game Joe realized he could have won if he had grabbed my Contol/ Tunnel Vision.<br>
<br>
Game 5:<br>
LS vs Pat Ziagos&#146;s No Parts No Deal (1816)<br>
<br>
Pat again, Yesterday he beat my deck due to some bad luck on my part but I am not holding my hopes high for this game. His first turn he pulls Watto and plays Dr.E and Panda to the Market Place to flip. This is followed by a Search and Destroy so I get pinged for three and it is my turn. I play Corran Horn and Battle against in the market place flipping him back and getting ride of SD. Then he drains with Watto but I play Lost In The Wilderness and make Watto missing (BWAHAHAHA) and he stays that way for the next couple of turn but that is the last of any thing good that happens to me.We fight on and off but I can never secure anyplace long and I can get a Breu and Owen for the life of me. I should have been able to secure the Market place except for 4-LOM with Gun who kept canceling my Jedi&#146;s immunity which cost me the game even thought I tried my hardest to kill it. So I went down slowly but surely and it took him the entire game to kill me but he did it by 18 which way the same amount I beat him by in the last game.<br>
8(+72)<br>
<br>
Props: None this game sucked for me.<br>
<br>
Lows: None it just sucked.<br>
<br>
Game 6:<br>
<br>
DS vs Joesph Gagliardi&#146;s WYS podracing (1910)<br>
<br>
I get to play Joe again. Out of the 12 people that were there I play 2 of the same people that I have played before but there really isn&#146;t anything I can do about it. Anyway I have a Sebulba&#146;s racer so I start it and flash him. He dosen&#146;t really do much the first turn. On my second turn I play choke Vader with his saber and Dre and Baba to the Cantina. The next couple of turns we spend getting stuff we need and setting up but he ends up winning the race cause I drew crap destinies(oh well) but he dosen&#146;t have the force to pay to get it back due to IAO. He also plays Dash in the OutRider to Kessel and Mirax in Pulsar Skate to Tat. I finally Managed to get all of my ships so I decide to go against Mirx with Boba Fett in Slave 1 so we battle and I end up out powering him by two which he losses from hand. On his turn he plays Han to the Skate and attacks I draw and 5 and he draws low so I only have to lose fett and 4 while he losses Han. He also deployed Yotts and Lando with Gun to the CC: DB. So on my turn I play Mara with her saber and Darth Maul with saber and TPM against them and attack. I cut Lando and Sinper/ Dark Strike to make him lost. I try to cut Yotts but he plays To Close For Comfort I draw a 5 so he only has to lose Yotts and 9 cause his Obj was flipped. Then I sperate mara and Maul. So I can drain for more. On his turn he attacks Mara with Wedge and Hanwith gun at the DS:DB but I play Put All Sections On Alert so he only get one battle destiny but it is a 6 and I draw a 5 so we clear the site. Then I finally go after Dash with Zuckuss with a tracked 5 but I have to lose 1 in power while he losses Dash. I then move to Tat where Mirax is. On his turn he lands and drains with her twice before I win the game by 7.<br>
10(+79)<br>
<br>
Props: My deck working like No one&#146;s business.<br>
<br>
Slops: None<br>
<br>
So It all comes down to the final game between Pat and ================ if Pat wins I win the tournament and if looses I don&#146;t and as you may have guessed Pat lost so I ended up getting 2nd place for the 2nd day in a row. but I got a 12 dollar gift certificate which bought me 5 packs of Curoscant which contained a Darth Maul, The Phantom Menence,P-59 along with some other okay stuff. <br>
<br>
1st: Mark Mattingly 10(+110)<br>
2nd: Jake Rich 10(+79)<br>
3rd: Pat Ziagos 8(+39)<br>
4th: Doug Faust 8(+31)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Doug for the ride down<br>
-Pat for running the tournament<br>
-blah blah blah<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Me only getting to play two people I had never played before.<br>
<br>
