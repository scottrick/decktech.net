<br>
It&#146;s 4 hours of sleep and 0 meals later, and I&#146;m playing cards again. wahoo.<br>
<br>
These games were all typed like two weeks ago, so they have some good detail.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs. Brian Rippetoe (2079) 10-Minute HD Racing<br>
Well, my huge racing arsenal consisting of Anakin&#146;s Racer, Too Close, and Step isn&#146;t gonna do it this time. I lose my 3rd race ever with WYS, which I guess isnt bad considering the fact that I&#146;m not racing. What&#146;s worse is that I&#146;m not packing the race shield, because I normally win, and I didn&#146;t even pull the race shield in my box of R3. So the Box hurts a lot. Then I can&#146;t find a Luke the whole game, which hurts more. I get my drain at Kessel going, but it isn&#146;t nearly enough to do any significant damage. Visage + Box + Drain of 3 at the Cantina = a 15-20 minute game.<br>
FL -34<br>
0(-34)<br>
Highs: ha! none<br>
Lows: Well, maybe, just maybe I&#146;ll get to play a random.scrub <br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs. Joseph Diniega (1748) WYS<br>
Note: I&#146;ve played too many games against WYS so this game might have details from another game mixed in. Sorry if it happens.<br>
<br>
The first few turns were like Oprah beating a struggling baby deer to death, and then eating it raw. My starting hand was a lot of red, so I drew and got characters. Well, that&#146;s usually a plus, but there&#146;s absolutely nothing for me to beat down on. Then when Josheph goes to space early, I can&#146;t find any of my space, and I lose a lot of cards. I get some defensive stuff, so I drop Vader to the Cantina to drain for some. Then I find Drop and start throwing back a lot of stuff I don&#146;t need. Then Maul goes down to the DB to start draining for 3. After I while, I finally found some space, so I was in a position to win it. Then I saw his second or third EPP Han and his second Angry Chewie go off the top to a drain. So now I&#146;m really not afraid of a beatdown. And I&#146;ve been recirculating cards for quite a while now, so when I look at my hand to put something back, I come across my Ghhhk Combo. Now, he&#146;s only got 2 cards in hand, I&#146;ve seen many Lukes/Chewies/Hans hit his lost pile, and I&#146;m gonna win soon enough, so I put back the Ghhk Combo. Then he drops Han and Chewie against Vader and battles. Phuck. I Force Field his tracked 6 to shoot Vader, but it&#146;s still Vader and 13 which swings a close game in my favor to his game. I lose to his drains in a few turns.<br>
FL -teens<br>
0(-50something)<br>
Highs: Having the game within arms reach...<br>
Lows: ...then getting my arm bitten off by that danm hungry Oprah<br>
<br>
I&#146;m sure I have no chance of making the Top 8, but I&#146;ve already set my mind. I&#146;m not gonna drop, because dropping is gay. And the game is fun to play, even if you&#146;re losing.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs. Steven Harpster (1733) THGG Racer<br>
This is gonna be my game. My deck was made to battle and clear sites, and it does just that. Not to mention that fact that I&#146;m sitting next to Brian Hunter and I ask him if I can absorb some skill. I guess he said yes or something, because I totally owned this game. I don&#146;t remember any details from this game except that Maul drained a lot, for a lot, and beatdowns were plentiful.  Thankfully, I was always on the giving end. One beatdown in particular; I YAB&#146;d Lando with Ginsu knife, and Padme took like half of Steven&#146;s deck with her to the lost pile. My huge pe-.. er drains finshed him off a few minutes later. Oh yeah, he won the race.<br>
FW +20s<br>
2(-30ish)<br>
Highs: My dark is good + fun to play, thats a plus<br>
Lows: hmm....I guess losing 6 to the race, but that&#146;s about it<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
LS vs. Don Kitzman (2065) Watto<br>
This game was ugly. You can read Don&#146;s report if you want some more detail. He flipped with Taliban and Watto, made me his b!tch for a while, and i didn&#146;t do much about it.  I had Celebration for 1 a turn, but then he kicked me out of the Cantina. Next Tat Maul went to space and killed Celebration while setting up Occ. The only high points were when Mirax + random.smug hit up Zuckuss for some battle damage like 3 turns in a row. ITTL is just great. And then the rest of the game sucked.<br>
FL-20s<br>
2(-50ish)<br>
Highs: Mirax smacking Zuckuss until Don was able to track<br>
Lows: Watto sucks. I guess Don is happy now that he got his revenge from Ramapo<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs. Chris Gogolen (1905) Brangus Racing<br>
This was the total opposite of yesterday&#146;s game. Or was it this morning&#146;s game? Anyway, I win his race again. Nothing new. Then SATM gets me a nice beatdown on Aurra. He couldn&#146;t find space, so I get my Kessel drain and start Celebrating without any trouble. That&#146;s about it.<br>
FW +30<br>
4(close to 0)<br>
Highs: Having a good game with WYS<br>
Lows: Playing and having to beat Chris<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
DS vs Kevin Shannon (2125) WYS Crafts<br>
Dammit, I really did not want this matchup.  With all of his guys in crafts I couldn&#146;t beatdown on anyone. Zuckuss died too early, so my space was pretty much shot. I died fast to his drains.<br>
FL-20s<br>
4(-20ish)<br>
Highs: None<br>
Lows: Stupid crafts...<br>
<br>
Game 7<br>
LS vs. Paul Maholic (1903) ISB Big Blue<br>
This was one of the most boring games out of the weekend, and one of the most thinking-required games as well. We pinged each other for like 2-5 each turn. We retrieved 1-2 each turn.  Boring. I couldn&#146;t find We&#146;re Doomed until there were only a few minutes left. I used it for like three turns. It helped a LOT and started to give me the upper hand. I was going to win it eventually. Then time was called. Paul had 11. I had 10. One more turn and I would&#146;ve had at least the TW. The only cool part was when I cancelled my own drain with Lost In The Wilderness and made the stupid droid go hungry.<br>
ML -11<br>
4(farther away from 0 than last game)<br>
Highs: I should&#146;ve won<br>
Lows: Yet I didn&#146;t.<br>
<br>
Game 8<br>
DS vs. Justin Beal (1777) QMC<br>
I remember my old Dr E/Disarmed beatdown deck that owned the EPP version of QMC back in the days of Tat. My current deck incorporates a lot of Dr. E beatdown stuff, so even though everyone was talking about how good QMC was, I wasn&#146;t worried at all. He took Bespin early, and I let him have it. I was too occupied with ground control. Maul with his double shtick drained for a lot, and then Mara went to some other site to drain for more. A recurring EPP Leia via the Bacta Tank actully helped me, I retrieved with After Her a lot. He Edged a few times late game, but it just let me get in another After Her. My drains were too much for him. A fairly easy matchup.<br>
FW + something<br>
6(negative someting)<br>
Highs: Owning QMC<br>
Lows: none<br>
<br>
So I finish my first year of playing Wars going 3-5 at Worlds. Not bad. Especially considering the fact that I could&#146;ve won games 2 and 7 if I had played just slightly smarter. Oh well, more sleep next year. I hope there&#146;s a next year.<br>
In the end my dark went 2-2, going 4-2 overall. Both loses were to WYS, but Crafts is just a bad matchup. The other loss could have easily been prevented.<br>
WYS went 1-3 again, going 2-4 for the weekend. For the previous 8 months it hasn&#146;t failed me. I guess it was just a bad weekend. It figures that at the tourneys after FCon it performed like its old self, with only a loss or two to date since FCon.<br>
<br>
Team Tourney<br>
Another 4 hours of sleep and 1 partial meal this time! Yes!!!!<br>
The Team tourny was pretty cool. Team IBMW, which consists of me, Bill, and Jon Dansbury, was desperately in need of a 4th person so we could drop Jon&#146;s scores. So we draft Dave Edmund, and he was a cool guy. We only end up staying for half the tourney anyway, because Jon&#146;s mom didn&#146;t want to stay much longer, and well, we didn&#146;t exactly want to stay in VA Beach. Sorry Dave :-)<br>
I&#146;m too lazy to write actual games, so I&#146;ll just give some basics. First game I got to play Mike Carr, the kick@ss guy who did a lot of work for FCon. That game was the best and funniest game I&#146;ve played in a long time. My WYS beat his Watto, but that&#146;s not really the point. The whole time we just joked loudly about random stuf, getting the attention of everyone at our table. Stuff like Anakin&#146;s and Sebulba&#146;s Racers, which somehow always ended up in our hands. We would say something like &quot;That card is so frickin broken, they really need to errata it&quot; and everyone would look to see what we were talking about. And Threepio WHPS, we said he was huge, and if you actually read his text, you&#146;d see that he&#146;s pretty useful. You&#146;d think people would learn, but nope, they kept looking over. Pretty funny.<br>
Then Game 2 I played Brian Fred&#146;s WYS, and he played too much space and not enough ground for me to beat on, so I lost. Then we said some good-byes and left.<br>
<br>
Wrap-Up<br>
Here&#146;s some of the stuff I learned at FCon:<br>
<br>
The Claw Fish Ritual<br>
If you start Claw Fish, your opponent will read it and possibly laugh at you. Then you get in a big battle, miss a decisive saber swing, then abuse Claw Fish and kill whoever. Then you switch another destiny that same turn, and they read it for a second time and follow up with some cursing (ex. &quot;Damn, that card&#146;s actually good&quot;). Everytime. It&#146;s extra funny when you watch for it.<br>
<br>
Luck<br>
Luck plays an important role in qualifying. I&#146;m usually not too superstitious, but from now on it&#146;s 2 Cosmic Brownies and Goodnight Moon before every Open. Luck also explains my poor performance in Day 2. See, that night I didn&#146;t read the book and I only had 1 brownie. Shame on me.<br>
<br>
WYS doesn&#146;t work like it used to<br>
For 8 months WYS has served me well, plus the month following FCon. But only during those two days did it play like absolute sh!t. Stupid smugglers...<br>
<br>
Now it&#146;s time for Props/Slops, because what would a report be without em?<br>
the coveted Like This props go to:<br>
Brownies<br>
Margaret Wise Brown, the author of Goodnight Moon<br>
Bill for letting me borrow tons of cards + countless hours of testing<br>
Jon for the ride<br>
everyone at DeckTech who helped make FCon posible<br>
Colo Claw Fish for kicking @ss<br>
<br>
regular props:<br>
Scott Lingrell for being a cool guy <br>
everyone who made the top 8<br>
Bastian for winning it<br>
Renier Wolfcastle (Simpsons) for sounding kinda like Bastian<br>
All my opponents, you guys + gals (of which i played two)were cool<br>
Kim Caton and John Veasey for drawing up for me <br>
My dark deck for going 4-2 over the weekend<br>
me for qualifying<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
My WYS for dying this weekend only.<br>
Decipher for cancelling Worlds + being stupid and not recognizing the event (although Bastian is definately the World Champ)<br>
<br>
I think that&#146;s all. If I forget anything, it&#146;ll end up on my Member Page sometime.<br>
Hopefully I&#146;ll see everyone next year<br>
