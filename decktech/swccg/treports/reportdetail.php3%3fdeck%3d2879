Pre-Tourney<br>
<br>
So its the Saturday before the tournament, I go to see my boss. He&#146;s who I work for. I work at Loblaws. Loblaws is a place that sells food. A lot of people would also call Loblaws a supermarker and/or grocery store.<br>
<br>
Eric to boss: I need this weekend off.<br>
<br>
Boss: No , I need you to work.<br>
<br>
Eric: My cousin is getting married, I have to go.<br>
<br>
Boss: You can go to the afterparty , I need you at work.<br>
<br>
Eric: Ok.<br>
<br>
(Eric proceeds to storm to the next aisle, where he demolishes a display of Pokemon related school material.)<br>
<br>
Ok so lying to my boss that there was my cousins wedding on the day of the DPC didn&#146;t work. So I was pretty much ready to sacrifice my job for cards. Thankfully, one of my co-workers decided to do my a huge favor and work my shift for the Saturday, which was amazing.<br>
<br>
So I playtest all week with a Profit Podracing deck, that is pretty good, but every other game I can&#146;t seem to get the destiny going. My dark was Avatar&#146;s Huntdown, which is one of my favorite decks, but I found it to be weak to sold WYS decks, so I thought to myself, what about Imperial Court. Imperial Court was one of my old decks that I had good sucess with until they invented Don&#146;t Do THat Again<br>
<br>
On Friday, I show up to Alex Klammrodt&#146;s house. Alex is my mentor. Alex has taught me a lot about the game. Alex has invited some people from Boston to go to DPC with. Among these people are H20 Justin Desai, Cody , Klema and some other guy. I can&#146;t believe I am not sure about their names, but whatever, I wasn&#146;t sleeping much that week.<br>
<br>
We playtest at Klammrodt&#146;s shack. Man that place is dispicable. Whatever, at least he doesn&#146;t live with his parents like I do. So I manage to lose to his QMC deck , and I lost the rece to Desai&#146;s HD by 1. I make my Profit higher destiny with some Out of Commisions and Double agent, and I&#146;m set.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 am the next morning. I awaken. Sprawled across the floor are the corpses of 4 Bostonians. I finish my decks and later greet my little brother who&#146;s fresh off of a 6 and 0 performance at the last local. We take the bus downtown.<br>
<br>
It was pretty amusing watching these Americans attempt to board the bus. They&#146;re trying to stuff ones down a coin slot and it takes them about 5 minutes to actually proceed to their seats, where I had been observing the entertaining incident. I don&#146;t think the bus driver could speak English either.<br>
<br>
We are walking down St-Joseph street, and after about 2000 addresses we arrive to this community center. Where we are greeted by medium Twigg. My first impression of this guy is that he&#146;s injected himself with pure sugar and proceeded to eat a handful of speed pills. In other words, he&#146;s really hyper. But freaking funny.<br>
<br>
We enter this community center and we follow the &quot;Deck Tech&quot; signs to this room. I was expecting to see a mass of 60-80 people, but there are more like 30. Not really that surprising considering the entree was 40 bucks Canadian. I don&#146;t think many scrubs were willing to dish that down for Clint Hays or Yannick ot win. I walk around after filling my decklist. I meet Mike Gemme, who lends me some cards. For the past month I&#146;ve had this grudge vs. the guy since I accused him of copying and posting Avatar&#146;s QMC, but he turned out to be a great guy, and he had some fukking funny stories to tell about Steve Baroni&#146;s mom, which are well detailed in his tournament report. OMG that shiat is funny.<br>
<br>
So I expecting to get paired against some scrub for game 1 since my rating is like less than 1600.  I hear Max Brian call: &quot;Matt Sokol vs. Eric George&quot;. Oh well, I have to play the world Champ, not some scrub.<br>
<br>
Game 1 : Eric George Imperial Court vs. Matt Sokol&#146;s Pile on Tatooine<br>
<br>
 To me, this was a great game from the start. I am not sure if I started Mob Points, but whatever. I deploy Arican in the chamber to satisfy court. He drops Qui Gon first turn with Saber, he also revolutions my Executer DBay Next turn, I use my Always Thinking with Your Stomach to make Qui missing and on my next turn, I No Escape for it, and I have another one in my hand. I am saving force for many turns. At one point I deployed U-3PO, EPP Vader and 4-Lom to beat on Threepio and Shmi for 12 overflow. He found his missing characters and started draining in the cantina. I know I monnoked the first revolution, but later he deployed like 2 more. I freaking deployed like 3 systems and started draining, my I Have You Nows won me the game.<br>
<br>
FW by 11<br>
 <br>
Highs: You know what the High is.<br>
Lows: I can&#146;t stop smiling and I don&#146;t want Matt to feel liek @#$%, cause I am rated something really damn low.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Eric George Profit vs. Pat Dinelle&#146;s Brangus<br>
<br>
Dinelle is one of my favorite guys to play, he is really fun and I admire his good sportsmanship and his win against cancer. He was inflicting a lot of damage vs. himself with the Dark Path but I ASB most of his race destinies. I sensed and Too Closed the race interrupts, and I think he lost all his Branguses. Pat has never drawn up, so he let me win the race and retrieve with I Did It, then I got some more back with On The Edge. The Profit damage did him in.<br>
<br>
FW by 26<br>
<br>
Highs: THe Profit deck is supposed to win vs. Brangus.<br>
Lows: Beating a fellow Quebecer.<br>
<br>
So I am now 2 and 0, so this means I&#146;ll be playing someone good. My prediction is correct.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Eric George Imperial Court vs. Clint Hays Solid WYS<br>
<br>
Clint was wearing the same hat as me. WTF. I was calm for some reason but I played like a @#$%ing moron. ALl he did was but Jedi Luke in the cantina with saber and Mirax at Kessel. I did jack and stayed at Tatooine. He on the Edged twice to boost his differential. Oh yeah, he Grimtashed my 2 EPP Vaders away. Which left with with a handful of I Have You Nows and Force Fields. This is one of those games where you just get schooled, and with good reason. The guy played like a machine.<br>
<br>
Highs: At one point I tracked a 6 with OAP!!!<br>
Lows: The grimtassh hurt worse than I thought it would.<br>
<br>
FL by 31<br>
<br>
Game 4: My Profit vs. Chris Fanchi&#146;s DS Senate no Hand Destruction.<br>
<br>
This guy is a pretty good player. This was my first game against senate and I thought I had a good chance with all my direct damage. He deployed every single Political effect. I rescued Han. He killed han, twice I think. I ASB for Han , but he died again I think. The race was what saved me from taking another beating as bad as Clint had just dealt me.<br>
I had bad luck in this game. At one point I drew a 0 to Lost in the Wilderness Palpy, and later I run Luke Runed into a battle that would probably win me the game, but I missed my slash, so he just lost Vader. I also never had Dodge or Narrow Escape.<br>
<br>
FL by 20<br>
<br>
Highs: My first experience against Senate.<br>
Lows: Bad Luck.<br>
<br>
Game 5: Eric George Profit vs. Greg Hodur&#146;s Brangus.<br>
<br>
He loses his first card from hand. Its Brangus. I out of commision it. He was doing me absolutely no damage even though he won the race without the box. I was doing him 2 Profit Damage and 2 in drains every turn for almost the entire game. All sections helped him big. This is kinda the part where I realized I really should have played with the new Grabber. But I&#146;m an idiot. So lets continue to my third round of Bad Luck. He gets the ROC combo. I on the edge to cancel it. He gets Much Anger back with No Escape. He gets the ROC combo on me again. I alter it, but it goes to his used cause he has Oppressive. He gets the ROC combo. He wins.<br>
<br>
FL by something pretty standard like 15-20<br>
Highs: OOC Brangus<br>
Lows: ROC Combo and forgetting to stick in the perma grabber.<br>
<br>
Next game: My Imperial Court vs. some really freaky guy with eye shadow&#146;s WYS racing.<br>
<br>
I set up Arica in the AC. He activates, does nothing for like 15 minutes, then draws. I was really bored this game. Nothing was happening. We had some battles where he lost his characters, and I lost my Vaders. I never established a good drain in space. He actually retrieved for the podrace. That was the first time that had ever happened against me.<br>
Uhh, this was by far the most boring game of my life and I lost to the freaky guy with eye shadow by 11 or so.<br>
<br>
FL by 11 <br>
<br>
Highs: Umm getting the rest from his 20 minutes turn where he did nothing. Wait, no, something good did happen. I laughed at him when he surprised assaulted himself for 5 force.<br>
<br>
Lows: Having to sometimes look at him, it was seriously really frightening. I never should have lost this game.<br>
<br>
So Alex is pissed at me cause I am his apprentice and I scrubbin out. He is in the top and I wish him luck. He tells me to concentrate and win my next 2 games.<br>
<br>
Game 7: Eric George vs. THE GUY HE PLAYS ALMOST EVERY FREAKING DAY OF THE WEEK... HIS FREAKING BROTHER kevin george.<br>
<br>
We think of rigging the game. But whatever. We were pissed that we paid money to be paired vs. eachother. So we just screw around.<br>
<br>
Highs: Absolutely nothing good happened during the 10 minutes that we completed this game in.<br>
<br>
Lows: WTF do u think.<br>
<br>
I win by 40, or so we reported.<br>
<br>
Game 8. My COurt vs. this guy from Quebec WYS.<br>
<br>
Ok so I forgot to activate first turn. I also forgot to force drain him once at kashhyk.<br>
<br>
I lost by 1........ 1<br>
<br>
Highs: Mostly everything went his way.<br>
Lows: Playing like the ultimate scrub.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Avatar loses to Desai so he doesn&#146;t get cash. I am not really happy with my performance. I did really learn a lot at my first big tournament so it is still a good experience. I was hindered by bad luck and my own mistakes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
To the boyz from Massachussets who were chill all day.<br>
<br>
Mike Gemme. OMG I fukking laughed at his stories. Plus he was totally chill to talk to , even though he declined to trade the picture of his sister for anything.<br>
<br>
Big Twigg. That guy is the biggest maniac of them all and his TIE bomber deck that collapsed all the WYS sites + the Senate. I laughed at this guy&#146;s comedy.<br>
<br>
Justin Desai. Nice going 5 and 3. I can&#146;t wait for Dark Jedi Testing.<br>
<br>
Yannick. You got your revenge for a couple of bad placings at the last tournaments. You play like a machine, your dark deck was sick plus you are my hero for playing profit.<br>
<br>
To the guy who wore the Lion King T-SHirt. Nice performance.<br>
<br>
Pat Dinelle. COolest guy ever.<br>
<br>

<br>
Alex Klammrodt: I have failed you for the last time. I promise.<br>
<br>
Sokol. This guy&#146;s chill.<br>
<br>
Hays. You fukkin schooled me. Plus you wore my hat. I&#146;m buying a new one.<br>
<br>
Larry Lee: I know you&#146;re reading this. Now get back into the game so we can own.<br>
<br>
I am not forgetting anyone but I have to rePROP GEmme&#146;s stories.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
