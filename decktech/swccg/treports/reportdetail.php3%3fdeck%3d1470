<br>
Well, getting ready for this tournament, I was a little apprehensive.  Big D&#146;s new sealed deck smashed my Rops into obilivon and so I had to scramble to build a new one.  In a brillant move, I had traded away all my Outer Rim Scouts, and I like drain decks, so I decided on my Non-flip Endor Ops with Tie interceptors filling the spacelanes.  I figured it would dominate in space, but if it faced RST of TIGIH, it would run into some trouble, as it is character light.  The tounament was held on the college campus, as our store had to relocate.  For light, I went with conventional EBO (get ANSB out starting) and Incom/x-wings.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
<br>
My Dark vs. Travis M(a?)cDonald&#146;s Hidden Base (copy of Chu&#146;s x-wing deck)<br>
<br>
I had rode down with Travis and some other friends to the tournament.  We all play with each other on a fairly regular basis.  Even so, Travis is fairly green yet, and unable to come up with something of his own, he decided to go with Hidden base.  This game went quick, and I never really let him into it.  I use Twi&#146;lek to get out Dreaded Imp Starfleet, a little unconventional, but it works.  We both set up fairly quick, I got Fondor out and he converted my Endor and put out Sullust.  A few x-wings were at Sullust while U-3PO and IG-88/gun were at the Endor sites providing my Max benifit from Ominous Rumors.  After 2 turns, I came down with Boba in ship along with Zuckuss and Chiraneu piloting and cleared his x-wings while he retreated to Rendezvous Point.  I deployed Bossk in ship along with a few ties to keep control of Sullust and Kessel and started draining for 7.  That pretty much ended it.  He loaded up the point and got Haven on it hoping to move out but eventually didn&#146;t have enough force to pull it off.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning, playing well<br>
Lows: beating up on a friend/newbie<br>
<br>
FW 2(+34)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
Light vs. Mike Raveling<br>
<br>
Mike was running a My Kind Of Scum deck with Abyssians.  I drew a good hand and got EBO set up quick while he drained for 3 on Tatooine.  There was 2 drain for 4 systems out my Kiffex and his Tatooine.  I had 5 x-wings down, bunching because I hadn&#146;t been able to find a signal yet for Incom.  He came with a loaded ZiMH packing 4-lom, and abyssin, and a cloud city scurb for forfiet fodder.  We battled multiple times at Kiffex, with my x-wings and later Spiral/tantive beating up on his ZiMH, but since he cancel my draw most of the time, and he had +2 on his, I was only able to get one decent card loss of nine.  Otherwise it was an abyssian that got forfieted along with only a couple other cards.  Latter I finally signaled for Incom, and just in time, as my x-wings were running out and started to pull ahead just a little.  What gave him the game was two seperate retrevials for a total of 11 using Jabba&#146;s Twerps and Abyssian Ornament.  He also canceled a couple drains of 4 with Myo and that hurt also.  Eventually, he drained my out.<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing a good opponent well, winning my fair share of battles, and Finally knocking out ZiMH late game.<br>
Lows: Not pulling it off, Myo hurts<br>
<br>
FL 2(+22)<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
Light vs. Josh Grace<br>
<br>
This game was never in doubt, at least for him.  CHYBC and S-D came out early to cause direct damage in droves and limit my drains for the opening part of the game on.  He played dark side Tatooine and his drains pounded on me for a long time.  I think my biggest drain was for four, and since I could draw any characters, my fate was sealed tight.  The game ended in a killing of Commander V. Willard after Zev go choked. It was like 15 power to 2. <br>
<br>
Highs: Not much, but he did end it in a battle.<br>
Lows: Where were my characters????? <br>
<br>
FL 2(-5)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
Dark vs. Brett Severson<br>
<br>
This game had me nervous a little at the start.  Brett played a TIGIH that he had earlier converted from RST so his deck had masses of characters, just what my deck didn&#146;t need.  I am a better player than he is, but I have a lot more experience, and he had just beat me recently so I knew he was confident.  He got Chewie, Madine, and Wuta + site out first turn after I deployed DS Sullust, Kessel, and Fondor  He deployed Battle Plan though, and that ended up hurting him in the long run.  I pulled Ominous Rumors, but lost it quick after it became apparent that he controlled 3 endor sites with an iron fist.  I never deployed a character on the planet.  Our battles were in space.  Dreaded Imp Starfleet was canceling his drain of 2, so he was draining for 2 ones while Adm. Chiraneu in Tyrant was getting 3 at Sullust.  Brett got Rend. Point out quick along with Independence, Nien/GS1 and Tala 2, Blount.  I had along with Tyrant, Bossk in Bus, Boba in his ship, 3 victory classes, and 5 or 6 ties, so I was chasing him around the stars.  It was a slow moving game and I won only because he moved his forces back to the point and I had control of Fondor/Sullust/Endor and was draining for 6 to his 2.  After awhile he came back out with Reinforcements to try and stop my drains.  I massed too and followed him around.  Eventually we had one big battle, 6 Interceptors, Bossk, and Tyrant/Chiraneu mixed it up with his forces.  All Power to weapons for a grand total of 60 to 36.  He lost everything and I drained him out next turn.<br>
<br>
Highs: I won a close game, against a tough deck for me<br>
Lows: It was close<br>
<br>
FW 4(0)<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
DS vs. Joe Henke<br>
<br>
This is the third time in this tournament that I&#146;ve had to play a friend (Travis, Brett).  What&#146;s up with that?  Joe was playing a profit that had stomped on my Endor earlier.  That time I didn&#146;t deploy any aliens, so this time I deployed Mara and Dengar/gun and hoped for the best.  For some stupid reason, I was thinking of my light deck and went for Mara&#146;s lightsaber before I activated.  Of course you have to DEPLOY it, so I was just being stupid.  I deployed Fondor and Kessel first turn though, so I had more activation later.  On his turn, Ben and Tawss beat up Mara and Dengar, I lost Dengar and he lost Tawss, but neither one us remembered Ben&#146;s game text until next turn.  Alter nailed DImpStarfleet and I didn&#146;t have a sense in hand, so I couldn&#146;t slow his drains.  He flipped, and set up his direct damage.  Mara moved away and I deployed some ties scattershot to endor, along with Boba to Fondor and Tyrant and some ties to Sullust.  Empy/Tarkin and IG-88 were occupying the Endor sites so I was draining for 11 and he was only getting across four, so he converted my DB and over came Ben, Tawss, and Han with Heavy.  They moved into the bunker, so Tarkin/Empy exited, and I was still draining for 10.  The drains made up for a slow start and I won by 4.<br>
<br>
Highs: nice drains, coming back<br>
Lows: I didn&#146;t have a sense<br>
<br>
FW 6(+4)<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
LS vs. Steve ?(sorry)<br>
<br>
Steve was playing a TDIGWATT.  My pile dark deck had gone <br>
3-0, and my Light deck, supposedly my better one, went 0-2 so far, so I was itching for a win.  I knew this would be tough, if he could set up DDeal, there wouldn&#146;t be much I could do.  That being said, a good hand could decide it.  Well, I drew my good hand.  EBG, Echo Corridor, an x-wing, signal, 2 organized attacks, Zev, and Obi w/stick.  I set EBO up turn 3 and lost the 2 organized to put 3 x-wings at Bespin and Cloud City with Incom on table.  He didn&#146;t deploy a ship the whole game and his max drain was 2 on CC.  Comm. Luke (I use him to be able to replace with Jedi), Zev, and Comm. Wedge were at the base, with Obi and Tawss being the perimator protectors.  I was draining for 6, and got a drain for 9 with Mon Calamari.  I also retreived 7 with All Wings.  Late game, he struck a moral victory.  First he played CC sabbac.  I drew 2 fives and a 1, and got IG-88 in ship for my efforts, then he deployed Boba Fett (CC), and Danz Boran on Tempest 1.  Tempest came in the the DB and Boba got off.  I battled with Jedi luke and Obi, hit Boba, cleared off Danz, and tempest on was moving back out.  He then reinforced with Dengar, Mara, Vader, and Jodo and moved in with Tempest 1 until he was at the DB.  Jodo flew to the war room and...he canceled EBO!  That was interesting to say the least.  I moved Obi over to help Zev take on Jodo who had killed Wedge earlier. My space drains were also down to five.  He drained for 4, battled obi and zev, played Hidden weapons, captured Obi, and I lost a force.  I was a fun way to end, and I drained him out next turn.<br>
<br>
FW 8(+17)<br>
<br>
This was my first 4-2 tournament, and I finished 9th out of 31 so I was very happy.  I got a foil executor, and Joe Henke pulled a Foil Luke Skywalker in a reflections pack.  <br>
It was a good day all around.<br>
