Cedar Grove, NJ, 20 May 01<br>
<br>
Time for States had finally come.  This was actually my first State Championships, since last year I was stuck in NY when NJ states were held, and stuck in NJ when NY states were held.  Which does kinda suck.  But this year we had some mad coordination going on, and all the Championships in Coruscant were on the same weekend, which meant that &quot;commuters&quot; like me would get to play.  So anyway, I&#146;m having a hard time getting tournaments in Ithaca, NY (where I go to school) sanctioned, so my actually playtesting is kinda scant, but I try to playtest online a bit too to test out decks and generally stay in practice.  In any case, the last real tournament I went to was Blythe&#146;s in NJ in March, where I took only one loss to Dalton and got 2nd.<br>
<br>
My Dark deck at Blythe&#146;s tournament, which was Black Sun Rumors, had gone 3-0 with good sized wins each time, so I was thinking I might be able to keep it around for states.  So I continued playtesting it for the next couple months, and surprisingly, all it did was lose.  Turns out most of the guys up in Ithaca are playing TIGIH, which is pretty bad for a deck that uses Rumors, and the guys that aren&#146;t playing TIGIH are playing random other stuff (that wasn&#146;t really popular back home) that happens to beat my deck.  So having lost my confidence in the deck, I go fishing for new ones.  After a brief stint with TIEs (in which everyone convinced me that EBOX beats TIEs every time despite my evidence to the contrary), I decided to try out Geoff Snider&#146;s &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; BHBM deck of which I had recently faced the wrath.  So I built the deck, knowing the general idea but not looking at the cardlist so I can personalize it for myself (how I usually build decks), and it turns out that I&#146;ve only changed four cards, which is really surprising.  First was Carida over Rendili, cause there&#146;s no reason not to switch this, and every reason to switch (no Victories).  Second was SSPFT over Secret Plans, cause SP never stopped anyone from doing anything, and SSPFT at least had cool text with Destroyers.  Third was Dengar over some random.destroyer, cause every deck that plans to stay in space needs Dengar (which I proceeded to prove in playtesting over and over again--Dengar wins games).  Fourth was Admiral Piett over Major Rhymer, cause Major Rhymer is ass.  In any case, this deck is HUGE, it won practically all of its games in playtesting, and had like no bad matchups except for maybe Kim Caton&#146;s &quot;Dagoboring&quot; deck.  Stuff like Hidden Mains was practically an auto-win.<br>
<br>
Light was a bit more trouble.  I had my EBOX Speeders deck, which was pretty solid and could easily hold its own in both space and ground.  However, that was the deck that gave me my only loss at the tourney in March, getting spanked by Dalton&#146;s MKOS Scum for 31 (!) force.  And if there&#146;s one thing true in NJ, you can&#146;t seriously expect to place in a big tournament if you can&#146;t beat Scum.  Of all players that I needed to be worried about at States, I only expected Scott and Tom *not* to be playing Scum.  So, my focus was on finding a deck whose primary goal was to beat Scum, but could stand against other stuff as well (such as the SYCFA or ISB Big Blue that Tom&#146;s been using lately).  So I&#146;m talking to Hayes Hunter (lord of all that is tech) online, and he recommends trying AITC Mains with Spaceport Docking Bay and Blount to hold off ISB.  So I throw something together, and playtest with it, but for some reason it really doesn&#146;t click with me.  I just keep thinking a good BHBM or Hunt Down deck (while not as popular in NJ) would rip it apart.  Meanwhile, everyone on IRC is just telling me how bad AITC mains is (esp. the one that I put together), so in the end I decide to scrap it, despite not having playtested it much.  I toy around with the idea of a Profit deck that was based on running away and abusing Order To Engage, with a few key cards to beat Scum, but I scrap that idea because I think it&#146;s too fragile.  In the end, Steve Kuperman convinces me to use his &quot;Scum Killa&quot; deck that he did well with at the Normal DPC and Ed Rebman got 2nd place with at Michigan States.  It&#146;s an old-school mains deck that starts Obi&#146;s Hut and CP to convert Scum&#146;s site, with lots of Bens and Sense/Alter.  Unfortunately, I had to ditch the Blount tech, because I couldn&#146;t rely on having a Coruscant site, but I didn&#146;t think I&#146;d see much (if any) ISB anyway.  In any case, the whole force choke strategy worked like a charm, and Honor prevented S/A from sucking too much.  Random tech choices like Landing Claws, I Hope She&#146;s Alright, and Demotion to help me against big blue.  The Dark was more solid of course, but isn&#146;t that always the way of things?<br>
<br>
Being a Squadron Member, I get my Tatooine boxes on Wednesday, which completely puts a crimp in my studying plans for my two last final exams on Thursday.  I end up getting 2 hours of sleep, take my finals, then head home on Friday with my brain pretty much shot.  So no playtesting for me until Saturday, really.  However, my sister is having a slumber party that weekend for her thirteenth birthday, so my mom wants to get us out of the house, and I completely agree.  So my dad ropes me into visiting my grandmother in Philadelphia, before my friend Mike calls me and invites me over for playtesting.  So I end up going to my grandmom&#146;s house instead of playtesting, which isn&#146;t completely a bad thing.  People should really visit old people as much as possible, seeing as they aren&#146;t going to be around forever.  But in any case, it means no playtesting before States for me.  I get home later than expected, seeing as I wanted to get up at 7:30am the next day to make the 2 hour trip up.  I get home around midnight, and head off to bed, but my sister and her friends are playing loud music and being overly noisy, so I don&#146;t end up getting to sleep until after 2am.  Ugh.<br>
<br>
I wake up on schedule the next morning, not feeling the best, but adequate at least.  I shower and stuff, and my mom has made a real nice breakfast, since all the girls were here.  One advantage to my sister&#146;s party, I guess.  So I eat, then Brian Kim and Chris Lanci show up at my house, borrow a whole bunch of cards from me, and we take off.  I pick up Mike Vitarelli on the way, who despite having borrowed like 20 cards from me the day before, still needs to borrow more cards.  We end up getting there about half an hour early, with thanks to EZ Pass (the electronic toll collection system in the Northeast).  So we walk up to the store, and it&#146;s all dark and the sign says &quot;closed&quot;.  Drat.  But it turns out that the store is actually open, and there are already some Star Wars people inside, so it&#146;s all cool.  We are one of the first ones there though, but slowly people start coming in.  The competition is about what I expected, with all the top Jersey guns showing up, like Mike Dalton, Tom H-K, Greg Hodur, Pete Flamini, and of course defending champ Scott Lingrell.  Also, Chris Gogolen and regional champ John Lolli were making triumphant returns to the game.  All in all we had 28 people, which is a little more than what people expected for this state.  So the pairings begin, and Greg gets paired against Pete, which is just hilarious, seeing that the same thing happened at last year&#146;s regional and they engineered a true tie, starting the whole true tie contraversy.  In any case, after several joking remarks about letting the game come to a coin toss, we continued down the pairings and I ended up being in the very last pairing (I hate that).<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Big Blue BHBM vs. Andrew Cirigliano&#146;s (1465) RTP/Death Star Plans<br>
<br>
Well I wasn&#146;t much concerned with his objective, as placing most stuff out of play doesn&#146;t do jack to my deck, but mass retrieval could be annoying as anything.  And I obviously hadn&#146;t playtested against RTP, so you never know.  In any case, I get a strong start, with SSPFT followed by Coward, which is certainly nice to cut off his retrieval.  He uses my objective to put Jedi Luke and his saber down at the Home One docking bay, and transits him over to Yavin before Vader comes down, which of course is annoying.  So real early I throw down Vader, grab him, and march over to the Death Star.  He puts 8D8 and other random RTP stuff down to go try to free Leia, but he keeps missing even though his destiny is good.  Meanwhile, he drops some mains down at the Yavin Docking Bay, so I drop a bunch of Walkers and pilots down and beat him some.  My attack wasn&#146;t overlarge, so he dropped some more characters next turn, drew a 5, and killed a Walker, which is annoying because Walkers aren&#146;t supposed to die.  I have like 2 card in my hand at this point, so my other Walker runs away.  I reinforce my space a little bit, but he&#146;s got nothing to counter it, and Battle Order is hurting him some.  My duels, on the other hand, are doing jack, seeing as his destiny is good and mind is a bunch of 1&#146;s.  He eventually does free Leia, and gets her back to the War Room in one turn.  Then he goes for the Death Star Plans, with him at both the Yavin and Death Star docking bays.  So I have to do something (I overdeployed in space and have been losing to my objective since the very beginning, so my Life Force isn&#146;t looking too good), so I come down en force to the Death Star docking bay and put a big ol&#146; dent in it after he concentrated his forces there to protect DSP.  My Walker that was hiding came back, and I held the Death Star docking bay with an iron fist.  Meanwhile, I had managed to track two of my recycled Admiral&#146;s Orders around and was making him lose 3 Force every turn to the duel.  After that, I killed most of the rest of his characters to make sure he&#146;d never satisfy Coward.  Time was running short, and he wasn&#146;t the fastest of players, so I was afraid we&#146;d time out, but my damage worked its course and I ended up winning by 12.  FW+12, 2(+12)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Stopping Death Star Plans.  I HATE mass retrieval.<br>
Lowlights: Overdeploying, and almost going to time.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Obi&#146;s Hut Mains vs. Tom Hermley-Keen&#146;s (1909) &quot;Dark Surgeon&quot; AOTBS<br>
<br>
I really couldn&#146;t figure out how I ended up playing Tom, as he had taken a fairly good-sized loss first game.  In any case, he was playing the deck I helped Alex Tennet playtest, and I knew from the start that I had a huge disadvantage in this matchup.  But at least I knew what was coming.  Anyway, he gets a fairly standard start, drops the Emperor at the Death Star Docking Bay or something, moves Xizor over there with a Vigo, and flips.  Meanwhile, I&#146;ve done nothing.  I decide that I have to take a risk, and I make the assumption that Tom didn&#146;t change much in the deck--that means no PASOA.  So I have Rebel Scout Luke in my hand along with a Smoke Screen.  If I come down, I think I can kill the Emperor or Xizor without taking any damage.  So I give it a try, there&#146;s no Barrier (I did have a Portal for backup), play my Smoke Screen.  But it turn out that the Vigo is forfeit +2 with Xizor, so he justs forfeits that.  Guh.  So he continues turning the crank on my death, and I put down Ben Kenobi and some friends on Tatooine.  He controls my drain of 1, which is silly, so I, losing horribly at this point, Sense it just to be annoying.  He Controls my Sense, so I just Sense it again.  Whatever.  I try making another attack on the Death Star, but that ends up as a failure.  He plays Force Lightning randomly to make my guy defense value -4 or whatever, despite the fact that he has no weapons.  I&#146;m bored and losing, so I Sense it out of spite, but then he plays I Have You Now.  So I lose everything and like 9, and his lost pile has like 3 cards in it, to my like 30.  At this point, I realize that I have to get Luke down on Tatooine and keep him there, because I&#146;ll never do anything if he&#146;s flipped.  So I activate like 14 Force and Tunnel Vision, but no Luke.  So I get Ounee Ta and get my Tunnel back, and try again next turn.  Still no Luke, blah.  I&#146;m left wondering where he&#146;s hiding.  Meanwhile, he attacks my position on Tatooine but it doesn&#146;t turn out so well for him.  I start using Yoxgit to get back a Landing Claw every turn and lose it to a drain, which does help some.  I&#146;ve managed to get a Monk and Obi&#146;s Saber out, so I&#146;m draining for 3.  He tries to spread out by putting a POTF on the Coruscant Docking Bay, but I alter it and flip him back, since he moved Xizor over.  I finally find Luke and drop him on Tatooine.  So now, even though he&#146;s got tons of Force to my little Force, I&#146;m not losing anything because Yoxgit is covering his drain.  He makes another attack on Tatooine with Boba Fett to back up his leftover 4-LOM and Iggy, but I manage to fend him off, and Ben prevents any real damage.  So he drops a POTF at Obi&#146;s Hut and puts Djas Puhr there.  I put down Lando w/ Ax to deal with him, he Barriers and I Sense.  They kill each other, so I don&#146;t have to deal with that.  Boba Fett, who somehow survived, moves over to Obi&#146;s Hut, but I draw an Alter and get rid of Presense, so Honor caps that at 1.  Meanwhile, my Monk and my Saber are still providing a steady drain of 3, and he&#146;s running out of characters.  I Alter Broken Concentration because it&#146;s being annoying.  We go on like that for a while, and Tom&#146;s being pretty helpless.  So eventually he decides the only thing he can do is move Fett over, and I wipe the floor with him and win the game.  FW+8, 4(+20)<br>
<br>
Highlights: That is the biggest comeback win I&#146;ve ever witnessed in SWCCG!<br>
Lowlights: Tom shuffled his Force Pile after peeking at it.  Tee-hee.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My Dark vs. Greg Hodur&#146;s (1853) Mad Crazy HB Flip deck<br>
<br>
I see Hidden Base, so I&#146;m expecting Hidden Mains which should be no problem.  But it was not to be.  First turn, he grabs General Lando with Strike Planning and drops the Falcon and such at Rendezvous Point, and drops a whole bunch of systems.  Meanwhile, I&#146;ve got unusually bad luck and and left trying to find a ship a bit more substantial than Dengar.  I&#146;ve drawn plenty of Walkers though, so I drop a couple Walkers down at the Spaceport Docking Bay along with Vader.  He digs through and gives me a Jedi Luke to have fun with, so I march back to the Death Star.  He starts deploying crazy amounts of ships to Rendezvous Point, and I&#146;m still digging for my ships.  Eventually I do find the Devastator, and he moves over and flips.  So I naturally go after him, but I&#146;m locked down until I can find his Hidden Base.  He goes and swarms around to his half-dozen different systems, draining like mad, and making my twin goals of minimizing his drain and finding his Hidden Base come in conflict with each other.  And Order To Engage was also forcing me into some bad decisions, and he was of course using my low hyperspeed against me.  He probably lured me away from it, but I didn&#146;t find the Hidden Base until my fourth attempt.  Anyway, by then it was too late.  I had only managed to get 2 of my 6 Star Destroyers on the table, and he still had ships everywhere, despite the fact that I did kill a few of them.  So he had around 4 groups of ships around draining, and I had two groups of ships to stop them, which just didn&#146;t work out too well.  Meanwhile, I seem to have almost completely forgotten that I was playing BHBM, as I think I forgot to lose a few to my objective, and I completely forgot about dueling or stacking cards for Insignificant.  I don&#146;t think it would&#146;ve affected the game, but who knows.  But it all came down to the fact that I got a slow start and couldn&#146;t get my ships on the table.  So he dominated all game and I lost.  FL-14, 4(+6)<br>
<br>
Highlights: None, I played like a scrub...<br>
Lowlights: Not drawing ships when I needed to<br>
<br>
Game 4: My Light vs. John Lolli&#146;s (1865) Big Blue ISB<br>
<br>
John&#146;s a bit out of practice, but he is the reigning Regional Champion, so this is definitely not going to be an easy matchup.  Furthermore, John was one of the large number of people I expected to be using Scum.  It turns out that of all the good players, only Pete stuck with his Scum deck.  I need a new crystal ball, I guess.  Anyway, I do have a fair number of tricks up my sleeve for ISB decks.  So we both start setting up our decks, and he gets the Executor to Fondor before long.  I deployed Goo on his first turn because I could, and Signaled for Honor because he was using TINT/OE.  I start dropping Ben and company on Tatooine to prepare for the drain race.  He gets out Admiral Chiraneau on the Executor and moves it over to Endor, so I Signal for Demotion and cancel him.  John grabs to Signal, but I&#146;m rather indifferent to that.  He drops Kessel and Fett in Slave 1 there to increase his drainage, and I start putting more guys and Monks on Tatooine.  He tries to block one of my drains with U-3P0, but I SATM him right away.  Then he goes ahead and puts DLOTS with Saber and a couple ORS at his Endor Docking Bay, and plays Battle Order.  Ugh.  Time to spring into action I guess.  I have EPP Luke and Chewie Protector in my hand, but Chewie doesn&#146;t tend to last long against Vader.  On the other hand, I need to fix this problem pronto.  So I drop Luke who gets Barriered, but I wasn&#146;t going to battle this turn so it&#146;s all good.  Then I Nabrun over Ben with Saber, Tawss, and Lando w/ Ax over, and I have a Portal for when he decides to attack.  He grabs the Nabrun, and I&#146;m indifferent.  Now it&#146;s his time to be concerned.  He doesn&#146;t battle with his severely outnumbered forces, but instead shuttles everyone and their mother from the Executor on down.  So I&#146;m left to battle him, but for some reason I don&#146;t go for Vader with my Sabers (I dunno what I was thinking), miss some scrub with Lando, and I draw Yoda&#146;s Hut for destiny.  He wins barely wins the battle, so I lose 1 because Tawss was wrong (I hate when that happens).  On his turn, he drops a some Blizzard 2 with an ORS and battles me.  I Portal, and he grabs it, and I&#146;m still indifferent.  My superior tracking skills tell me I either have a 3 or a 5 on top, but for some reason I think 3 won&#146;t get rid of 2 ORS (if anyone asks, I can&#146;t add), so I play it safe and just target 1 ORS.  I draw a 1 and get him.  Okay, now I&#146;m wondering where that 1 came from, as a 3 or a 5 was supposed to be on top.  Superior tracking skills indeed.  In any case, I figure I probably just mistracked by 1, so I&#146;ve now got a 3 and a 5 on top.  Meanwhile, he chokes Lando with a 4, which is ugly.  I swing at Vader with Ben, and draw a 3 and a 2.  Well that&#146;s not a 3 and a 5.  Ugly.  I&#146;m kind of frustrated now, and to top it off he pulls off some minor miracle with his destiny and hits Ben with a 4,2 and the odds card.  That&#146;s gotta hurt.  So I take one final swing at Vader.  First destiny was a 5, but it was a Nar Shaddaa, not the Signal I was tracking.  Hmm.  Second was good ol&#146; Yoda&#146;s Hut.  DOH!  The 5 and the 3 were right below the Yoda&#146;s Hut, I thought the last card I activated was the Yoda&#146;s Hut, but apparently I was WAY off.  So anyway, I draw one of them for destiny, and I have to lose everyone but Tawss.  That battle was decisive and the game hinged upon it.  Then he Monnoks me Lost when I have 12 cards in my hand.  I have a couple Senses, but he&#146;s got 3 battlegrounds so Honor does squat.  I&#146;d lose 4 cards if it went through, and lose 3 cards if I Sensed it, but I decide just to let it be because he loses the Monnok that way instead of it going to used.  Anyway, I couldn&#146;t muster up anyone to back up Tawss against the mess of guys he had there, so he ran away to the Chirpa&#146;s Hut I deployed earlier.  I Tunnel Visioned for another Ben and used Yoxgit to get his Saber back, so I had Ben back on Tatooine in no time.  Also, I deployed Red Leader In Red 1 with a Landing Claw to block his drain at Endor and so I don&#146;t get choked to death by Battle Order.  He deploys another ship at Fondor, and switches Fett and the Executor so I&#146;d only be blocking a drain of 1.  So now he&#146;s draining for 5, and I&#146;m draining for 4 and using Yoxgit, but he&#146;s also retrieving ISB agents and he has more Life Force to begin with.  Then he goes and drops 5D6 at Obi&#146;s Hut.  I hate that droid.  So I spread out to have a weapon at every site, and blast him.  I&#146;m running desperately low on Force at this point, and he decides to spread out and go after Tawss.  Tawss battles Vader but doesn&#146;t get hurt too much, as he misses.  We continue the drain game, but now it&#146;s my turn and I realize he&#146;s going to drain me out next turn, so I detach Red Leader and suicide it against the Executor to lose the game.  FL-8, 4(-2)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Demoting Chiraneau.  John was certainly impressed by that little bit of tech, but of course it came from Hayes.<br>
Lowlights: Mistracking and not killing Vader when I needed to...<br>
<br>
Game 5: My Light vs. Vikram Bali&#146;s (1498) BHBM Mains<br>
<br>
Vikram&#146;s a good player despite the low rating, but I saw this deck at the tourney in March and I snowplowed it.  Of course that was with a different deck.  Vikram however made the mistake of playing no Sense/Alter protection whatsoever.  Anyway, he starts out as expected, dropping the Emperor at the DS2 Docking Bay first turn.  I give him some Goo, and he returns the favor with Bad Feeling.  I save up for a while, then start deploying mains on Tatooine, starting with Ben and Lando, and Alter Bad Feeling of course.  I get a Hnemthe on Tatooine and make his guys super-expensive.  He attacks with Mara and Saber, because Vader&#146;s too expensive, and attacks.  He tries to YAB Ben, but I Sense it.  He misses his swing, and Ben&#146;s text makes the battle completely ineffectual.  He tries a few more similar attacks, but they all result in utter failure to get rid of any of my guys.  He puts Chimaera at the Rendili he deployed, so I went ahead and put Red Leader with a Landing Claw there.  At this point, I&#146;m pretty much Sensing or Altering anything he does, and he&#146;s pretty helpless without his effects and interrupts.  He finally gives up on Tatooine, and drops Vader with Saber on Endor.  Fortunately for me, I happen to have Rebel Scout Luke in my hand just then, so I deploy him and send him back to his master.  He&#146;s taken quite a bit of battle damage while not having killed anything at all, and I&#146;m draining for around 4 to his no drains at all.  Plus his objective is helping me out at this point.  Basically I pretty much had a counter for whatever he did.  So I easily won.  FW+21, 6(+19)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Completely dominating.<br>
Lowlights: Being low enough in the standings to completely dominate.<br>
<br>
Game 6: My Dark vs. Andrew Rakowski&#146;s (1463) WYS Stuff<br>
<br>
Now sure how I ended up paired against Andrew, and he was 2-3 and I was 3-2, and my differential wasn&#146;t that bad.  Anyway, my Dark deck has absolutely no problems with WYS, with the possible exception of that goofy euro-version.  He starts with Signal for Goo.  While this is a minor setback for me, I think it&#146;d have been much better for him to use 3 effects (esp. Squadron Assignments, the deck was screaming for it).  So I get set up and he deploys Kessel right away (if one goes through all the trouble of starting Goo, giving me lots of Force right away is probably not the way to go), and it seems like all I can find is Walkers, no Destroyers, so I drop a bunch of Walkers and pilots to the Tatooine Docking Bay.  He deploys Luke and Han to the Cantina alone and I cringed.  Gotta do what you gotta do, I guess.  So I deploy EPP Vader, grab Luke, and beat up on Han.  I missed Vader, so there&#146;s no battle damage, but I did get to stack a card.  So Vader starts the long journey home, and I continue to dig for starships.  He uses Local Defenses to fetch Pulsar Skate, which is kind of nifty, but without Squadron Assignments it&#146;s iffy.  He finally does manage to get Mirax on the Skate out at Kessel.  And I&#146;m still digging.  There&#146;s 6 Destroyers in the deck, and I have more cards in my hand than I do in my Reserve deck at this point looking for only a single one of them!  I finally manage to grab the Devastator, so I deploy it, recycle all of the Admiral&#146;s Orders that were building up in my hand, and easily take down the Skate.  He deploys Wedge and a couple Ralltiir Freighter Captains to the Cantina, but I ignore them and move the Devastator over to Tatooine.  I of course track around a few of those 6&#146;s, and start dueling Luke with a furor.  He keeps dumping guys to the Cantina, which I&#146;m ignoring.  Meanwhile I&#146;m draining away.  He eventually decides it&#146;s the time to move, so his 5 RFC&#146;s and Wedge move out in front of my Walkers, leaving EJP Lando in the Cantina.  He plays Nar Shaddaa to retrieve, but he draw a 5 to his 5 RFCs and fails.  I deploy Battle Deployment, and Igar on Tempest 1 and battle.  I easily win, and a few RFCs bite the dust.  The rest of them spend a large amount of Force to go visit the Death Star.  I move some guys over and make short work of Lando.  He deploys some more stuff in space, but he&#146;s still got the pay for Battle Order because the Death Star site isn&#146;t a battleground.  I deploy another ship for good measure, but my drain of 3 plus the 3 from dueling each turn quickly does him in.  FW+19, 8(+38)<br>
<br>
So I end up with a somewhat respectable score, though for some reason my score is 8(45).  Probably remember one of my differentials wrong, oh well.  Of my car, I ended up doing the best, edging out Brian by 2 differential.  Mike did okay with a 3-3, and we won&#146;t talk about how Chris did.  But I was thoughtful enough to memorize the top ten (notes? who needs notes?), so here they are:<br>
<br>
1. Michael Dalton (1946)<br>
2. Scott Lingrell (1880)<br>
3. Greg Hodur (1853)<br>
4. Jonathan Mamay (1479)<br>
5. Chris Gogolen (1828)<br>
6. Pete Flamini (1825)<br>
7. John Terkovich (1596)<br>
8. Doug Faust (1790)<br>
9. Brian Kim (1870)<br>
10. Greg Shaw (1530)<br>
<br>
So everyone was taking off, but I was curious as to who would win the finals between Dalton and Scott.  Last year, Scott was champ and Dalton was runner-up, so we could have a repeat, or Dalton could get his revenge.  So after some discussion about what happened at NY states, Rich is super-strict about watching the finals, so I decide to go play a few friendly games with the people in my car.  After Brian shows me that my Light deck dies when Luke, Ben, and Lando are captured and Leia and Han are dead (!), Mike again proves that my Dark deck is utterly useless against Dagoboring.  We finish up, and find out that Mike Dalton won with his ISB over Scott&#146;s Hidden Mains by 24, which Scott was pretty much expecting, he planned to come back big with his Dark.  The game of Scott&#146;s AOTBS Manipulator (kinda like Surgeon I guess, but with only 5 Emperors and stuff like A Dangerous Time) vs. Dalton&#146;s Hidden Mains (gee, why didn&#146;t I get to play against these Hidden Mains decks) was slowly wrapping up.  Scott clearly had the lead in the game, but not by enough to win the title.  Mike kept pecking away at Scott&#146;s forces, and retriving lots of Edge cards.  However, the Broken Concentration kept Mike from drawing up and going home the winner.  Mike managed to kill Xizor, and the Emperor, but wasn&#146;t left with many characters himself.  Scott still had Zuckuss at a system though, but eventually he gave up and didn&#146;t leave any Force.  So Mike drew up and lost by 13, becoming the New Jersey State Champion.<br>
