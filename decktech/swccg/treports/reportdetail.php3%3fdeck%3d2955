If you think you will learn something useful here. You are making a BIG mistake. You will NOT be more intelligent.. You are free to press the back button. Or alt+f4. But I don&amp;#8217;t want to heard you complain that there was no strategy. Or that you have a small penis, it is not my problem !<br>
<br>
10 month ago someone call maxim &quot;The Burntoast&quot; briand told me that he was going to do a DPC in Montreal. He told me he will need someone to judge, and ask me to be the TD . SO I was like WATEVER DUDE !<br>
<br>
Then a couple month ago I see on Decktech the Montreal DPC . and they say I am the judge... SO I am like sh1t dude that suck I wanted to play. But it seems like I am the judge.  Then I think, and I realise I had never organise a tournament before.  So i download all the DPC rules and the current ruling 50 pages sh1t and read all that crap. <br>
<br>
The 2 week before, me Yannick and Raphael play tested a lot . Raphael had a good TIGIH deck. And Yannick sucked big brown huge mega tasty  balls. He had nothing. His best deck was 3-16, DS senators. Well he told me he had won with it 3 times, but I heard it was against his Mom . And I am serious. And his light side was ugly. He was supposed to blow up the bunker , but usually at the end of the game he was giving me a blowjob. OH YES ! Yannick Suck well<br>
<br>
So most good player from the USA were coming. Jonathan Chu, The Twiggs. Matt Sokol. Clint. Yannick told me TJ and Criss had a car crash so they wont be coming. And that was bad<br>
<br>
SO the Friday of the DPC. There was a warm up . And Maxim ask me if i was coming to play cause there was only 10 people. And I said no, the Twigg should come soon, and I must stay home. And from now on he kept calling me every f&quot;cking 10 minutes to know if they had arrive. so after calling me like 20 mother f*cking times he told me ok,  I will start the Warm up. So I am like DUDE your 2 hours late GO B1tch. And he told me OH yes ! I like it when you call me that name. <br>
<br>
So they finally got to my house. There was the 2 Twigg. Michael Gemme and someone else.... I dont remember his name... sorry. Well I dont have a good memory. The only reason I remember Michael Gemme s name is because my sister kept telling me he was pretty. <br>
<br>
then I call Dominic s Friend, and he come pick me up. So we go see what is happening at the Warm up. The name of the shop is the Crosmos . In English it would be the mastur-batt-most. There was nothing to see. Only raphael beating scrub. OH GOD I am the TD I should not say that. Ok, ok I am sorry . Raphael Asselin was beating weak minded player. <br>
<br>
So when its over we go eat at the $ BURGERKING $ . oh sorry if the name is in $$ . they pay me to do promotion. So after we eat our marvellous Hamburger and awesome French fries we go to yannick s House. <br>
<br>
I was with my (at that time) girlfriend Audree. But it was not going really well. So we saw Clint. Chu.... and a Girl Call Myriam... She is  really pretty and played SWCCG. It was like the 4th times I had seen her but I had never bother talking to her, cause she was living like 5 hours away.. but now she was living in monteal. OH YES ! OH YES YOU HEARD ME ! it was time for the Dom-Inator . A sophisticated sexual robot send back thru time to change the future for one lucky lady . So I told her : you have been targeted by the Dom-inator , get ready to experiment the Dom-ination. First impression is really important... with those word I knew I already had her in my bed. <br>
<br>
So I played a RAW deal game with Clint and Chu and Small Twigg. and I suck. Then I go play Super Smash Brother. and Chu comes . and he use some Donkey Kong Throw to wreck me... At that time I had no clue how to stop that :( so he owned me. I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE. LINK IS THE BEST ! NOT THE 1 / 4  Brained Monkey.<br>
<br>
then the Twiggs need to go back to my house for my sister or sumthing. So I said sure , and I come back 20 minutes later. I should have stayed at my house with them but... remember ... Myriam was there.... OH YES.  OHHHH YESSSSS. <br>
<br>
So I go back , and I have fun. the only thing that sucked is that Myriam had now put some pants on cause she was cold with a skirt... in fact it really sucked cause when I was playing Nintendo (before)  I could see her underwear :) Hehe. but Audree was no longer here, she was at my house . So it was not the end of the world.<br>
<br>
So I go back home. And I talk with team Twiggs . And they seems to have good deck. Surprisingly my sister was still talking to Mike Gemme. <br>
<br>
And I go to sleep.<br>
<br>
And I wake up.<br>
<br>
I go downstairs to wake team Twigg up but I dont see Mike Gemme.... hmmmm I wonder where he is. Finally I find him somewhere.<br>
<br>
So we get ready and I call yannick to pick me up .  He was 10 minutes late ??? weird hey ???  So we go pick Dominic s Friend up and we head to Rendezvous point with Raphael.  Raphael is the craziest driver ever he almost get us killed 2 times....<br>
<br>
We finally find the place. And in the room where I am to Direct the tournament there is plenty toys/games/ Water Gun and some Black banana.... <br>
<br>
Then I see Ghetto Leader. And he is f*cking pissed cause some mofo broke his car window and stole his CD. but at least he still had his small Dildo.<br>
<br>
And then Myriam arrive, and I go talk to her. As a tournement director I asked her if she needed special attention. But I wont tell you what she reply<br>
<br>
Then Greg comes to talk to me and tell that I should f*ck her..... OH YES . so I say : OH YES. you just had a great idea dude !<br>
<br>
So the tournament start. the first few round there is nothing interesting.<br>
<br>
Chu and Clint are playing WYS-Control. and Branglus-Control-Direct Damage. Yannick had just made a Profit deck that he had never test and was playing that gay Senator Deck. Raph was playing BHBM high Destiny and His home made version of TIGIH. The Twigg were playing Main and Toy/ Twix and Dagoba and both HDADTJ. Alex Klamroth was Playing Cloud City and HDADTJ. Matt Sokol was playing Maul Hutt and some Main and Toy for light I think. <br>
<br>
Other than that there was lots of weird archetype. <br>
<br>
1 cool game i noticed was Yan Profit vs. Clint Branglus<br>
<br>
yannick got hit for like 20 in Odds. but won the race. Clint was tracking perfect sabac. yan was getting rape. and sometimes Clint was set for stun on han. Locking Yannick for 1 turn. but Yannick manage to track a perfect sabac. and Clint had no more Insert... I dont exactly know why... so Clint was now lock and Profit was doing his damage.  Eventualy yannick won as clint needed yannick to activate to do damage.<br>
<br>
then I go talk  to myriam and I tell her that I need her phone number because if i get lost somewhere at least i will have someone to help me find my way. And she gave it to me.<br>
<br>
We Order Pizza, and I think its pretty cool to be TD. I have someone call Dominic s Friend that do all the paring/deckcheck . And Andrew Lui is watching games people want a judge to watch to make sure there is no cheating.  I just have to make the good ruling. And Maxim is yelling at me to start Time, so its really cool.<br>
<br>
Then after game 5 . Audree  and the Girlfriend of Dominic s Friend, Julie arrived.... OH NO ! WHY !!!!!! WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN TO ME ! WTF ARE THEY DOING THERE. <br>
<br>
So with all those girl there, we made a survey . Who is the sexiest guy to play SWCCG. <br>
<br>
Number 1 :           are you ready ??? Well it is me.. Ok, ok  I am kidding.<br>
<br>
1 is Martin Akesson<br>
2 Is Mike Gemme<br>
3 Is Matt Sokol<br>
4 IS my Choice ONLY , my all time favorite : Ti-Gars , you can see a picture of him at :http://www.geocities.com/swccg666/TopPlayers/TiGars/tigars.html<br>
<br>
Oh yes ! He like Diaper<br>
<br>
now round 8.... Clint had dropped. the Twiggs were out of top 4 . Alex was playing Chu. on Alex turn, he activated 2 , play nemodian Advisor, deploy Site..... but I told him that he could no longer activate... that move really hurt him.  Gogolen, the Undefeated was playing Martin Pereault . A fiend of mine... Martin was playing My WYS but I forgot to tell him that the battle plan should be a combo ( he had not play since Provincial),.. and its a beatdown deck with beggar and all... and Gogolen was playing tie bomber,..... anyways close game. it timed as both players had a equal number of card in deck/hand. but martin won cause of his lost pile. now yannick was playing Raphael , and raphael was playing BHBM and its Auto-Win against Profit so he won.<br>
<br>
<br>
The top 4 weres the Following <br>
<br>
Gogolen<br>
Raph<br>
The Yellow Menace<br>
Crusher<br>
<br>
So lets start the final.. me and Dom s Friend decided to watch Raph/Chu while Burntoast/Andrew was watching Yan/Gogolen<br>
<br>
Raph had Already Beaten That deck but played by clint so he was confident. <br>
<br>
I must say that Chu played very well and Raph played poorly. At the start there was a important fight witch raph drew a 0 battle destiny... from there it was downhill for him. The Insert has killed him<br>
<br>
So Yan and Chu won<br>
<br>
First game is CHU WYS VS YAN SCENATOR CRAP<br>
<br>
Well it was a strategic game. nothing in particular happen. yannick set up the pod race with the box on turn 6 maybe . chu play ITCBW of 11 and had a its a hit in hand. Then Chu Spread and won easily by 15 or so. Chu had put Vader out of commission, removing most treath.<br>
<br>
Second game<br>
<br>
First Turn yannick Goes Masta Luke/ saber  and Epp Ben . Jonny had Echo was room and Responsibility of command in hand and deploy brangus. yan drain for 5. chu lost from top of deck much anger in him... and got it back with a DB. so they both had super start. but chu had difficulty getting a character to the site. to make him loose 4 force. yan won the Race . But nothing interesting Yan won by maybe 20.<br>
<br>
Congratulation to both player as they play really good game. And they deserve their position<br>
<br>
So it was over...  BYE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OH no ! it was not over yet !<br>
<br>
We decided to got to some sh1tty place call the Peel Pub. So we go there. Well we tried, but Raphael Almost hit a hydrant ??? ( the fireman think that is in the street to stop fire) . And then he hit a Car. Anyways , we got there. And we ordered  some beer that taste like the yellow stuff that sometimes come out of your penis. And some food. Me and Raph did a spaghetti contest.  The one who eat the most by putting our faces in the plate. Do I have to tell you that I EASILY won , and that my face was all red ??? But it was kind of funny, there was a guy  nude with a diaper. And a girl holding a Giant ( 5 feet ) penis. Oh yeah, and there was all those little preppy girls dancing like some fuc*ing @#$%got. They were hilarious.  And then  me, Audree, Yannick, Raph, Julie and Dominic s Friend  went to our house because  we suck, or maybe because we wanted to be sucked.. And The bunch went to the titties Club&amp;#8230; Ok I dont exactly know what happened but I heard that  They had fun..  So we left, and we go in the car&amp;#8230; and we finaly listen to some f*cking real music.											<br>

So The next week I go out with Myriam to the movie. We decided to see the movie American pie 2. THIS WAS A BAD MOVE. Cause she had seen the Real Sherminator talking, and now she knew that I had mimicked him, and that he was cooler than me. But after that I counter stroked by saying  Asta la Vista Baby. And that was just too much for her. So she was forced to kiss me&amp;#8230;. Dude Those word are powerful. Never underestimate the power of the Dom-inator. <br>
