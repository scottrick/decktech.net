<br>
On Saturday, March 31st, 42 of the best SW:CCG players in Texas converged on the Austin Convention Center to determine who would be crowned the 2001 Texas State Champion.  After 12 hours of play, 120 regular games, and THREE, yes, THREE final confrontation games (a tie-breaker was required), Justin Warren of Killeen emerged as the new champion.  Congratulations to Justin, who outlasted John Sneed of Fort Worth to earn a bye into Day 2 of the World Championships.<br>
<br>
It was a long and exciting tournament, and I will do my best to recount all of the days events.  However, let me start with some overview information about the tournament, and more importantly, the decks that we&#146;re being played:<br>
<br>
Total players: 42 (3 dropped)<br>
Total Games: 120<br>
DS Wins: 67 (55.8%)<br>
LS Wins: 53 (44.2%)<br>
Games called on time: 9 (5 DS wins and 4 LS wins)<br>
<br>
A list of the final standings appears at the end of this report.<br>
<br>
DECK ANALYSIS<br>
Light Side - Not surprisingly, Watch Your Step was the LS deck of choice at this tournament.  A few players (including Justin Warren) were playing the Palace Raider version, but most were playing with all the other smugglers.  Hidden Base Mains and MWYHL Mains were also popular choices among the top players, as well as several Test to 6 decks.  Of course, everyone was expecting to see decks like these.  As a result, many people were surprised to see the following unusual creations hit the table:<br>
- Throne Room Snowspeeders (an Eric Berger creation)<br>
- Ewok Swarm (a Mike Patterson monstrosity)<br>
- Agents in the Court with Moisture Farmers and Vaporators<br>
- Don&#146;t Underestimate Their Chances with Y-Wing beatdown<br>
<br>
There were also a few Profit decks making the rounds, as well as Asteroid Sanctuary and one or two X-Wing Swarms.<br>
<br>
Dark Side - Interestingly enough, at least half of all DS decks opted to concentrate on space rather than ground.  As a result, there were lots of Endor Operations and BHBM TIE decks making the rounds.  Not surprisingly, these decks were packing lots of love for those pesky smuggler ships, including SFS-Laser Cannons, Talon Roll/Dark Maneuvers, and Imperial Command.  Despite the concentration on space, Hunt Down was being played by most of the top players, including both finalists.  There were also a few MKOS and ISB decks being played, as well as Prodigy.  As with LS, there were a few unusual DS decks that deserve special mention, including:<br>
- A beautiful Big Blue space deck with TRACTOR BEAMS (an Ira Babb masterpiece)<br>
- Trooper Assault Beatdown from Hell (a Michael Sneed construct)<br>
- A clever Big Blue deck that used Emergency Deployment and tracked Star Destroyers for a one-turn beatdown in space (read the card…what a great idea!)<br>
- A BHBM TIE deck with 20+ 6&#146;s and 7&#146;s and 4 Counter Assaults (ouch!)<br>
<br>
Now that the preliminary stuff is out of the way, let&#146;s get down to the meat and potatoes of this report.   I&#146;m sure you are curious to hear about the final confrontation, but before I get to that, let me set the stage.  Starting with the 3rd game of the day, I paid very close attention to the deck matchups and results at the top 4 tables.  Here is a rundown of how the regular tournament finished with John Sneed in the #1 spot at 11 (+131) and Justin Warren close on his heels at 10 (+86):<br>
<br>
GAME 3<br>
There were still several undefeated players at this point, and the top game featured Jacob Mayer&#146;s Throne Room Mains vs. Eric Clegg&#146;s Endor Ops.  This game ended quickly when the Jacob revolutioned on the bunker and beat the snot out of Ephant Mon.  Table 2 featured Keyah Saleh&#146;s Ketwol EBO vs. Justin Warren&#146;s HDADTJ, with Hunt Down winning easily.  This game was decided by unstoppable Visage loss and a key space battle in which Justin tracked his destiny and hit the LS for massive battle damage.  Table 3 featured HDADTJ vs. the Y-Wing swarm deck I mentioned in the deck survey.   An early Monnok depleted the LS forces and gave the DS an easy win.  Finally, at Table 4, an Ewok swarm deck absolutely dominated BHBM Mains.<br>
<br>
When the dust cleared after Game 3, 6 players were still undefeated.<br>
<br>
Before moving on to Game 4, I need to pause to give special attention to a very unusual game in this round between Eric Berger and Jerrod Smith.  Eric was playing a TIE Swarm deck and Jerrod was playing Asteroid Sanctuary.  Neither player started an objective.  Both players revealed their starting location at the beginning of the game…..and both started with KESSEL!!!!!!  What are the odds?!?!?  In any event, everyone got a nice laugh out of this and Eric won the game to stay undefeated.<br>
<br>
GAME 4<br>
Due to the luck of the draw, most of the undefeated players did not face each other in Game 4, with the exception of Table 1, which featured John Sneed&#146;s Hidden Mains deck vs. Jacob Mayer&#146;s Hunt Down.  John dominated this game from start to finish, coasting to an easy win by 30.  Jacob took the loss in stride, but told me that he wouldn&#146;t be able to sit down for a week after the spanking he endured.  At Table 2, Justin Warren&#146;s Palace Raiders faced off against Nathan Schutz&#146; interesting Court Space deck, with the Palace Raiders prevailing after a few tense moments early in the game.  At Table 3, Eric Berger&#146;s Throne Room speeder swarm dominated Keyah Saleh&#146;s Hunt Down deck, and thanks to Honor, forced the DS to lose to Visage the entire game.  By the way, Keyah gets the bad luck award for this game, since he Twileked for No Escape on his second turn and the elusive card was in his force pile!  DOH!  Finally, at Table 4, a TIGIH Mains deck overwhelmed an Endor Ops Biker Scout deck.<br>
<br>
At the end of Game 4, 4 players were still undefeated: John Sneed, Justin Warren, Eric Berger, and Micah White.  All four would play each other in Game 5.<br>
<br>
GAME 5<br>
At this point in the tournament, the atmosphere at the top 4 tables became very intense.  At Table 1, Justin Warren&#146;s HDADTJ faced off against John Sneed&#146;s Hidden Mains deck.  Neither player knew it at the time, but this would be the first of 3 times that they would play this matchup.  On this occasion, John eeked out a TIMED WIN, with 10 cards in force pile to Justin&#146;s 6.  I will let Justin describe this game in his tournament report, but needless to say, this was a very, very close game.  At Table 2, Micah White&#146;s BHBM TIE Odds beat Eric Berger&#146;s Throne Room speeders by 12.  This was also a tight game, which was decided early when Eric lost Honor of the Jedi to a force drain.  Finally, at Table 3, Joe Amaya&#146;s DS Mains deck (with no objective) beat Jacob Mayer&#146;s Throne Room mains.  Unfortunately for Jacob, it was another spanking.  ;-)<br>
<br>
At the end of Game 5, only two players were undefeated, but BOTH had a timed win!!  As a result, 4 other players with only 1 loss also had a chance to advance.  The 6 remaining competitors were matched against each other in the final game, setting the stage for a thrilling finish…..<br>
<br>
GAME 6<br>
Here is a game by game blow of the three key matchups:<br>
<br>
Table 1: DS John Sneed, 9 (+109) vs. LS Micah White, 9 (+89)<br>
Because both players had a timed win, the winner of this game would advance to the final and the loser would be done.  John was playing Hunt Down and Keyah was playing TIGIH Mains.  Unfortunately for Micah, this game was decided early when his Executor suicide force got trapped at the Holotheatre.  I believe Micah battled, but John chose not to draw battle destiny, forcing Chewie and Wedge to stand alone and wait for the beatdown.  The beatdown came the next turn, and Micah had to lose 17 cards.  That was game, and John advanced to the final confrontation as the only undefeated player.<br>
<br>
Table 2: LS Justin Warren, 8 (+76) vs. DS Eric Berger, 8 (+65)<br>
This was a tough game for me to watch, since I&#146;m good friends with both of these guys and helped both of them playtest in advance of this tournament.  In any event, Justin was playing WYS Palace Raiders and Eric was playing his TIE Swarm deck.  The TIES took an early lead, relying on space drains and Talon Rolls to take out the Falcon and Outrider.  Justin fought back though, and managed to gain the upper hand thanks to some late retrieval and I Hope She&#146;s All Right.  Once again, I will leave additional game details to Justin, but this was a wonderful game between two great players.  It was a shame that someone had to lose, but Eric bowed out gracefully and Justin won by 10. Since Michael Sneed had only won his game by 20 (see below), Justin advanced to the final with differential to spare.<br>
<br>
Table 3: LS Joe Amaya, 8 (+62) vs. DS Michael Sneed, 8 (+56)<br>
Because of their differentials, both players knew that they needed to win big in order to have a chance to advance.  Joe was playing MWYHL Test to 1 while Michael was playing his clever ISB Trooper Assault deck.  Although on paper this matchup would appear to favor the LS, Michael had a few tricks up his sleeve and managed to trap Chewie and Ben at the Cantina staring down the rifles of 8 troopers.  Several more troopers and the Dark Lord soon joined the party, and the game quickly ended with trooper assault and dark jedi presence.  Since he committed lots of cards to the table, Michael only won by 20.  This was not enough to overtake Justin, so the all-brother final was not meant to be.<br>
<br>
FINAL CONFRONTATION<br>
After giving out the trophies for 3rd-8th place and setting up an &quot;arena&quot; for the final confrontation, the gladiators…er…players were escorted into the room and shuffled their cards.  Since John finished first he was allowed to choose the side he wanted to play first.  Since he had played his LS vs. Justin in Game 5, he decided to play Dark.  I took detailed notes during the game, so here is the play by play analysis of Game 1:<br>
<br>
GAME 1<br>
John Sneed playing HDADTJ, starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Crush the Rebellion<br>
Justin Warren playing WYS, starting Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Squassin<br>
<br>
DS Turn 1 - Justin plays OOC/TT to cancel Visage.  John grabs Carida, activates 6, deploys Carida, deploys No Escape and takes Visage into hand (nice play), and redeploys Visage.  John then deploys DLOTS with saber to Tatooine: DB, and flips his objective.  Justin loses 1 to Visage.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 1 - Justin activates 7, pulls Kessel from reserve.  Draws all 7.  John plays Monnok used (this was a devastating play and really slowed Justin down).  Justin loses to Visage.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 2 - John drains for 2 at Tat: DB, deploys Exec: DB, plays Imperial Command for Grand Admiral Thrawn, pulls Evader/Monnok with Crush, and draws.  John forgets Visage!<br>
<br>
LS Turn 2 - Justin deploys the Spaceport: DB, and draws.  John forgets Visage again.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 3 - John drains for 2.  Plays Monnok lost and gets 2 Palace Raiders (doesn&#146;t sound like much, but this was essentially the game).  John deploys Tarkin and Mara to the Tat: DB.  He searches for a DB, and finds none.  Mara&#146;s stick is NOT in his reserve deck.  John plays Omni Box to used pile and remembers to make Justin lose to Visage.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 3 - Justin deploys Jedi Luke to the Cantina and  Signals for the Bargaining Table.   Hunt Down flips back.  Both players ignore Visage.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 4 - John drains for 2, deploys Endor:DB and Secret Plans.  Twi-leks for Lateral Damage.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 4 - Justin drains for 2 at the Cantina, deploys a Patrol Craft to Spaceport:DB, and draws.  Both players lose to Visage.  Justin plays Nar Shadda for a Palace Raider.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 5 - John drains for 2, Justin cancels with Raider to the Tank.  John deploys Mara&#146;s saber and Dengar with gun to Tat:DB.  Moves Vader and Tarkin to the Cantina.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 5 - Justin activates, plays Control/Tunnel Vision.  Deploys a palace raider and craft to Tat:DB, deploys a raider to spaceport:DB, and flips WYS.  Plays OOC/TT from the lost pile to cancel Visage.  Moves Luke to the Tat:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 6 - John activates all but 3 cards.  Searches for DB and has destinies of 5, 2, and 2.  Drains for 3 at Cantina.  Justin cancels with a raider.  Deploys Chimaera, Thrawn, and Guri to Tatooine.  Deploys Battle Deployment.  Moves Vader and Tarkin to Tat:DB.  Moves Dengar to Chimaera.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 6 - Justin activates and plays Control/Tunnel Vision from lost pile.  Drains for 1 at the Spaceport:DB.  Deploys Kessel and Capt. Han/Falcon (via Squassin).  Deploys a raider to Falcon and I&#146;ll Take the Leader.  John takes Battle Deployment into hand (via Thrawn).  Justin kicks himself for making this error.  Moves Luke to Cantina, and Raider/Craft to Spaceport:DB.  Plays A Few Maneuvers used and draws.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 7 - John drains for 2 at Tatooine and 3 at the Tat:DB.  Deploys Battle Deployment and Emperor, Ponda Baba/Dr. Evazan to Tat:DB.  Moves Vader and Tarkin to Cantina.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 7 - Justin activates and plays On the Edge to retrieve 5 (he pays for Secret Plans).  Drains for 3 at Kessel and 1 at Spaceport:DB.  Deploys Wedge and Pulsar Skate to Kessel.  Moves Luke to Tat:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 8 - John drains for 5 (Tatooine and Cantina).  Justin tries to cancel one drain using Control/TV from lost pile.  It&#146;s not there.  John deploys the D*:DB, and Blizzard 2 to Tat:DB.  Battles Luke.  Justin reacts with both patrol craft/raiders.  John plays I Have You Now (emperor) and then You Are Beaten on Luke (Mara with stick).  John&#146;s destiny draws are bad, and ends up with Power 29 to Justin&#146;s 14 (he drew a 6 for destiny).  Justin loses 2 Raiders, a craft, and 1 card from hand.  John moves Blizzard 2 to the Spaceport:DB and the Chimaera to Kessel.  Draws.<br>
<br>
Although Justin survived this battle, losing the raiders and patrol craft essentially ended the game.  For the next several turns, John drained for 5-6 a turn and chased Luke and the Falcon from site to site and system to system.  There was one more notable battle involving Jedi Luke, but before Luke could be slaughtered, Justin played a suicide On the Edge to remove Luke from the table and end the battle.  After this, John had the overwhelming advantage on the ground and in space (Guri helped tremendously), and eventually won by 11 cards.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, there were 3 keys to John&#146;s victory:<br>
1. Early Monnok used stripped Justin of all his characters and prevented him from flipping WYS for several turns.<br>
2. Early Monnok lost removed 2 raiders from Justin&#146;s hand and further delayed his flip.<br>
3. Devastating battle at Tatooine:DB did not cause force loss, but removed most LS characters from the table and allowed John to spread out and drain.<br>
<br>
Now on to game 2.  John needed a win or loss by less than 11 to win the State Championship.  Also, you will recall that John and Justin had already played this matchup in Game 5, so they both knew what cards the other was playing and what to watch out for.  This made for a very interesting game.<br>
<br>
GAME 2<br>
John Sneed playing Hidden Base Mains, starting Battle Plan, Staging Areas, and Insurrection<br>
Justin Warren playing HDADTJ, starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Crush the Rebellion<br>
<br>
DS Turn 1 - Justin pulls Carida and Evader/Monnok from reserve.  Activates 4, deploys Carida, Secret Plans, and CC:DB.  Plays Monnok lost, but Jason has no multiples.  Both players ignore Visage (in fact, both players ignored it for most of the game, so I won&#146;t keep repeating it).<br>
<br>
LS Turn 1 - John activates, deploys Tat:DB and Corulag from reserve, deploys Ben Kenobi to the Tat:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 2 - Justin activates, deploys No Escape, and retrieves the lost Monnok (nice move).  Justin is holding DLOTS and his stick in hand and takes several minutes to consider his next move.  He finally decides to go after Ben and deploys DLOTS WITHOUT his stick to Tat:DB (Justin knew that John had Weapon Levitation in his hand, so he was hoping to make the kill without losing the stick).  Justin battles and plays I Have You Now.  Both players draw poorly (John 1 and Justin 2 and 1).  John loses 3 cards to battle damage.  Justin moves Vader to the CC:DB and uses Crush to draw I Have You Now.<br>
<br>
This early battle really set the tone for the rest of the game.  Since both players knew the other&#146;s deck, this game quickly became a test of wits.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 2 - John deploys Dagobah and Yoda&#146;s hut, plays Throw Me Another Charge used, and draws lots of cards.  John did not drain because of Battle Plan (this became a huge factor late in the game).<br>
<br>
DS Turn 3 - Justin plays Monnok lost and nails John for 6 cards (2 On the Edge, 2 EPP Leias, and 2 Fallen Portals).  This was devastating.  John was left with no characters in hand so Justin deployed Vader&#146;s stick on DLOTS and drew.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 3 - John deploys Order to Engage (this was the play of the game…you&#146;ll see why later) and draws lots of cards (finally pulling characters).<br>
<br>
DS Turn 4 - Justin pays 3 to drain for 2, deploys Tarkin and Emperor to CC:DB and starts recycling Force Lightning (played on Tarkin each turn).<br>
<br>
LS Turn 4 - John pays 3 to drain for 1.  Deploys Jedi Luke with saber and Corran Horn, and moves everyone (including Ben) to the CC:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 5 - Justin activates and plays Sniper on Ben.  He misses with a tracked 5 and a 1!  Deploys Sim Aloo and Guri to CC:DB.  Sim checks top card of John&#146;s force pile (it&#146;s a 5) and moves to the bottom.  Justin battles.  John plays Weapon Levitation and steals Vader&#146;s saber.  Justin plays I Have You Now so he can draw 4 destiny (3 with the interrupt and 1 with Sim/Palpy).  Justin wins the battle with Power 33 (10 attrition) to John&#146;s 16.  John loses Luke and Corran and revives Luke with Ben.  Justin moves all his characters to the D*:DB.<br>
<br>
Note: This battle was a near miss for Justin.  If he had successfully snipered Ben, the game would have been over.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 5 - John activates and plays On the Edge for 5.  Deploys Hmenthe and Tawss Khaa to Home One:DB and moves them to the Executor:DB.  Draws.  Justin plays Imperial Command to grab Chiraneau and Masterful Move to grab Holonet Transmission.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 6 - Justin pays 3 to drain for 1.  Deploys Mara Jade and her stick to Exec:DB.  Plays You are Beaten on Tawss and battles the lone H&#146;menthe.  The H&#146;menthe is hit with the saber and Justin draws a 3 for destiny.  John loses the H&#146;menthe and 6 force.  Justin moves Mara to CC:DB.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 6 - John pays 6 to drain for 2 (Tat:DB and Exec:DB).  Moves Luke to Home One:DB and Ben to Exec:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 7 - Justin pays to drain for 2 and deploys Chimaera and Chiraneau to Carida.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 7 - John pays to drain for 1 and moves Ben to D*:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 8 - Justin drains for 2 and 2.  Deploys Xizor to D*:DB and battles Ben.  John plays Narrow Escape and moves Ben to the CC:DB.  Justin loses 3 force to Order to Engage and moves Xizor to Exec:DB to face Tawss.<br>
<br>
Note: After the game, several squadron members conferred and we decided that Narrow Escape may not be a legal response to a battle if the character needs to use docking bay transit to move away.  We are checking with the rules gurus at Decipher.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 8 - John has 11 cards left.  He deploys the Falcon and Capt Han to Corulag, moves Ben to Tat:DB and Luke to Exec:DB.  This was a desperation move but forced Justin to respond.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 9 - Justin drains for 6, leaving John with 5 force (1 in hand, 4 in reserve).  Justin deploys Thrawn to the Exec:DB to join Xizor (facing off against Tawss and Luke).  Justin battles.  John swings at Xizor and hits, and plays Blaster Proficiency (his last card in hand) to make Xizor immediately lost.  Justin draws a 5 for battle destiny and must lose Thrawn and 2 cards.  John loses Tawss.  Justin moves the Chimaera to Corulag.  Justin is down to 17 cards (this is important!!!)<br>
<br>
LS Turn 9 - John drains for 3.  Moves Luke to Exec:Holotheater and Ben to the D*:DB to block Justin&#146;s remaining drains.  Justin is down to 14 cards.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 10 - Justin can&#146;t drain anywhere but has the game in hand.  Justin must do 2 things to win the game with more than 11 force: Battle the Falcon (forcing John to forfeit Han so that he no longer satisfies Battle Plan), and battle Ben to satisfy Order to Engage.  Justin successfully accomplishes the first task, BUT FORGETS TO BATTLE BEN!!!!!!  John asks Justin if his battle phase is over.  Justin says yes, so John makes him lose 3 force.  Justin asks if he can go back to his battle phase but we rule that he cannot (this was a tough ruling, but you are not allowed to go back phases, even if you haven&#146;t done anything in your next phase).  Justin loses 3 cards, leaving him with 11.<br>
<br>
The game ends the next turn, with Justin winning by 11.  As a result, we have the unthinkable…a tie after the first two games of the final confrontation.<br>
<br>
I have never had to deal with a situation like this before, so I confer with my fellow squadron members (Chris Gregg and Mike Patterson).  I decide that the fairest thing to do is hold a one game playoff, with the winner taking all.  Chris and Mike agree so we move to the 3rd and final game.<br>
<br>
In order to determine who plays what, I decide to flip a coin and let John call it in the air.  John decides to let the coin decide, and says he&#146;ll play LS if its heads and DS if its tails.  I flip and its heads.  John will play LS and Justin will play DS….for the 3rd time in the tournament.<br>
<br>
GAME 3<br>
John Sneed playing Hidden Base Mains, starting Staging Areas, and Insurrection (NO Battle Plan)<br>
Justin Warren playing HDADTJ, starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Crush the Rebellion<br>
<br>
Since Battle Plan hurt him more than it did Justin, John elects to start only two effects with Heading for the Medical Frigate.  Battle Plan stays in his reserve deck.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 1 - Justin deploys Carida and Exec:DB and searches for Evader/Monnok.  Unlike the last game, he does not use it.  He leaves all 4 force active.  Once again, both players forget Visage.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 1 - John deploys Home One:DB, Dagobah, and Yoda&#146;s Hut.  He also uses 2 force to deploy Order to Engage.  The entire crowd erupts in laughter (even Justin had to laugh).  ;-)<br>
<br>
DS Turn 2 - Justin activates and now elects to play Monnok lost.  He gets nothing, but again sees Ben in hand.  Justin deploys Vader and his stick to the CC:DB.  John loses 1 to Visage.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 2 - John deploys Corulag and Tat:DB, along with Ben Kenobi and a H&#146;menthe to the Tat:DB.  Plays Throw me another charge used.  Draws.  Visage is ignored.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 3 - Justin drains for 2 at the CC:DB, deploys the D*:DB and plays Imperial Command for Chiraneau.  Draws.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 3 - John drains for 1 at the Tat:DB and plays OOC/TT to cancel Visage.  Justin cancels TT with Holonet Transmission.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 4 - Justin activates a bunch and drains for 2.  Deploys Something Special Planned for them, Chiraneau, Thrawn and Chimaera to Carida, and Tarkin to CC:DB.  Justin plays Masterful Move for Holonet Transmission, and then uses the card to search his used pile for an imperial.  He grabs the Emperor and draws his remaining cards.<br>
<br>
Note: Using Holonet Transmission to get the Emperor was a great play.  Kudos to Justin.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 4 - John drains for 1, plays Fall of the Legend and Throw Me Another Charge used.  Deploys Lando with Ax to Tat:DB and Deploys Tawss to the Home One:DB.  John makes both players lose to Visage.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 5 - Justin activates 3 and Twilek&#146;s for Secret Plans.  Continues activating and drains for 2 and 2.  Deploys Secret Plans and Emperor to CC:DB.  Plays Imperial Command and Force Lightning used.  Draws.<br>
<br>
LS Turn 5 - Activates all but 2 cards (both 6&#146;s).  Deploys Jedi Luke and stick to Home One:DB and plays On the Edge for 5 (pays 5 and the card is placed out of play).  Deploys Chewie:Protector to Tat:DB and moves everyone except Tawss to the CC:DB.<br>
<br>
DS Turn 6 - This turn won the State Championships for Justin.  The next several game actions are so important that I have listed them separately:<br>
<br>
- Justin activates only 8, and drains for 2.<br>
- Justin snipers Luke and kills him with tracked destiny.<br>
- Justin plays You are Beaten on Lando but John cancels it with Weapon Levitation.<br>
- Justin deploys No Escape and Mara with her stick to the CC:DB.  Justin battles.<br>
- John plays Fallen Portal targeting Vader and draws a 6.  Justin cancels the destiny draw with Tarkin (this was a great play, and made all the difference in the world).<br>
- DLOTS chokes Lando and succeeds.   Lando is immediately lost (leaving Ben, Chewie, and the Hmenthe).<br>
- DLOTS swings at Ben and hits.  Ben is forfeit 0.<br>
- Justin plays I Have You Now.<br>
- Mara swings at Chewie and hits.  Chewie is forfeit 0.<br>
- Both players draw destiny.  John draws a 5 and Justin draws 1 and 1.<br>
- Justin forfeits Tarkin.  John must clear the site and lose 3 cards.<br>
- John loses to Visage.<br>
<br>
Without question, this battle ended the game.  John still had lots of cards left but the only card on the LS side of the table was Tawss Khaa.  For the next several turns, Justin drained and made John lose to Visage.  John attempted a late comeback with Capt Han and the Falcon, but Lateral Damage and tracked 6 for destiny ended that effort.  Justin finally drained John out, and won the tie-breaker and the Championship by 20 cards.  Congratulations Justin!!<br>
<br>
FINAL COMMENTS<br>
I hope you enjoyed this tournament report, which is by far the longest I have ever written.  Without question, this tournament was the highlight of my career as a Squadron member.  Special thanks to the people who made it possible, particularly my wife Melissa (who helped all day), fellow Squad members Chris Gregg and Jeff Weitkampt, and Jeremy Losee (who was a tremendous help.  Hey Jeremy, I&#146;ll make you a tournament director yet!)  Thanks also to Mike Patterson and Eric Berger for all their help and support before, during, and after the big event.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to extend a special thanks to the 42 players who came out for the Championships.  I was particularly grateful for the way the players rallied behind me when I announced that I was losing more than $300 on this tournament (the room rental was $650 and the trophies cost $100, but I only charged a $10 entry fee.  Obviously, I was expecting more than 42 players, but they never materialized.)  In any event, the players were spectacular, chipping in additional funds as they could.  By the end of the tournament, I received an additional $160 in donations, leaving me only $170 in the hole.  To everyone who contributed - A MILLION THANKS!!!!<br>
<br>
