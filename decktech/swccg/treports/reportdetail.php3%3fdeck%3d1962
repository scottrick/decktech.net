<br>
     Hey, its time for another tournament report by Michael Schiemer! It was on a Saturday at 2:00 and since I had nothing better to do I decided to get some practice before states. The prize was a japanese foily vader and I would have very little competition for it since Hayes and Eric Hunter, Steve Baroni, and the out of state crews werent showing. I come with my same undefeated HD admirals for dark with some extra anti-WYS tech and for light a solid HB mains with matching starships/pilots and system/db with battle plan and menace fades.They were both good decks and this was probably the last time I would get to use them before states. <br>
      I come almost on time and I talk with Mike Pistone and Matt Magann(sorry for spelling) about how we&#146;re gonna lay the smackdown on each others candy asses. I am instantly challenged in RAW DEAL by Pistone who has a Benoit deck crafted from a few packs and a few starters. My Mankind deck is a sad sack that consists of 1 Mankind starter, thats all.We play and he is talking smack because he knows how to play better than me mostly because I had never played a game . He destorys me early on because my gay starter only has moves that require 2 or 3 fortitude and for the first half of the game I have no fortitude on table.I&#146;m taking a pounding every turn but Micky reduces some of the damge and lets me draw like mad. <br>
      Pistone is humming the Benoit theme and I&#146;m getting desperate. I finally counter a move or something and can start playing cards out of my 10 card hand. I eventually retrieve some cards and mount some nasty 5 damage attacks. It adds up and finally the turn I run out of cards , I finish him of with a 15 damage card. I don&#146;t know if it is a win but it was pretty good for a @#$%ty mankind starter deck. I don&#146;t really know what I&#146;m talking about so don&#146;t criticize me for it. <br>
      ....Anyways, we eventually get 12 people and we are ready for a gay 4 gamer tourney.I hate 4 gamers although this was my first one.Some notables were my bro Jimmy Schiemer(1792), Michael Hawley(1740), and of course Jared Greenwald(1329). My rating coming in is 2015.<br>
<br>
                    GAMES<br>
<br>
Game 1 My Light vs ????s decent MKOS<br>
<br>
    I am ready to rape scum this game and it worked like it should.I set up falcon, outrider, and and red 7 all with matching pilots to endor . luke with saber and obi are at the endor db draining for 3 with ITTL. Menace fades and battle plan were giving him hell especially since I deployed them the turn after he spreads out and deploys gallid.He activates 12 and has to pay to drain, I activate 15 and don&#146;t pay to drain. He cancels my drain of 3 a few time with his reps and spends 9 to drain for 3. All he has is secret plans out and no grabbers in hand so all the force I loseis retrieved by OTEs. I then retrieved them with more OTEs and ounee tah. He realized he was slowly getting killed so he decides to attack me. I barrier his dre+baba and down comes dengar w/gun, ephqant man and some scrub alien. Order to engage is out so he decides to battle instead of lose 3. I fallen portal his dengar with a 1 and hit his ephant and scrub. He would have to lose about 10-15 battle damage but he ghhyks it away. Dre and baba are still left so I beat the living @#$% out of them with twass, chewie protector and orri or someone. I don&#146;t cancel game teext forgetting that dengar gets a destiny. He draws a 7(5+2 from objective) but i still rule his ass. he loses him and 18, I lose chewie. That is about game so I cycle a card or 2 and its over.<br>
FW by 25<br>
2(+25)<br>
<br>
Game 2 My dark vs Paul Maholics WYS harvest/raiders and crafts/celebration.<br>
<br>
     I automatically saw that thsi was a decktech deck, I just forget whose. I get a lord in hand but my executor db is not in my reserve deck so I can&#146;t deploy him 1st turn like I want to.He sets up a patrol carft and raider at his tat. and spaceport db, flipping the objective. I set up vader and mara with their sabers for some nice drains. Thrawn and avenger go to tatoine, later followed by chiraneau. I can&#146;t get anything I need, like No escape for his spaceport db, 2 emperors are lost off the top of my deck, I can&#146;t get my battle order or twilecks, and my ground charactres are somewhere inconvenient.I am hurting him alot but then he puts luke and chewie in cantina and I can&#146;t stop them from draining without my ground characters. I get out battle deployment and guri on ground with a command in my hand so I&#146;m set for battle. I think I have pretty much won when he deploys owen+beru with talon and harvests twice. SSPFT is out but that gives him a nice comeback. He has OOC+TT in lost pile but he never plays it so I&#146;m taking a beating from that never ending visage. This hurts me more than him because I can&#146;t just retrieve it. I stop most of his drains by movintg vader, mara, and janus to the cantina and som losers to the site of one of his patrol crafts. I am afraid to battle outside because of fallen portals in his lost pile so I am lucky he doesnt have order to engage out.Luke, chewie and random smuggler battle me at the cantina for some reason and I shoot down luke and chewie with a tracked destiny. I lose janus because chewie cancelled his immunity and he loses everyone. I love battle deployment! He finally puts someone in space, dash and outrider to my rendili. I play zuckus in hunter but he barriers. I lat damage his ship to tat system where my fleet has been waiting for a a battle. He moves there and unfortuinately kills lat damage. I only have enough force for bosk in hounds tootyh to deploy but I have tracked 4,5,4,6 and 4 battle destinies with command. He is dead after my power of 30 to his power of about 10. A much closer game than it shoulkd have been. I never got what I needed when I needed it. My ds deck should be auto win vs WYS.<br>
FW by 13<br>
4(+38)<br>
<br>
Game 3 My light vs Jared Greenwalds(1329) Decktech ROPS.<br>
<br>
   This is an auto win for me because I start ounee tah as one of my 3 effects. Jared plays well but I just can&#146;t lose with mains, big @#$% space power, retrieval, and ounee tah. I set up luke at endor db and ships at endor. When he finally gets out his raltir sites and flips I move my ships, including elyk rue, to raltir and deploy/move some of my guys to his spaceport db. I get out order to engage and get off some on the edges so I can&#146; t lose. Some of my cahracters get killed from battle but I just retriev them and deploy others back to raltir. After some even offense I flip back raltir ops and set up battle plan on his raltir sites and rendili. I drain himm out or beat him in a battle or something that wins me thge game. All I know is that Orri inflicted like 8 or 10 card losses for him.<br>
FW by 31<br>
6(+71)<br>
<br>
Game 4 My dark vs Michael hawleys(1740) tatoine celbration hidden mains with cantina shuffle.<br>
<br>
  Well he never really got off the shuffle, just Mos Eisley. I basically set up thrawn, chimara, chiraneu and someone else at tatoine and vader, mara and others at dbs and mos eisly. I beat down his scrubs/mains at mos eisley with ig, 4lom, mighty jabba, etc. I pretty much had board control the whole time. Visage was cancelled 1st turn so I didn&#146;t lose any important cards of the top of my deck. We had one big battle where vader and saber, mara and saber,dre+baba, and janus were fighting LSJK and saber, lando w/ax and geezum at the ds db. I monnoked his hand to make sure he had no weapon lev and the I battled. He fallen portalled my mara but I expected that. I weapon leved his lukes saber so his offense was very little. Vader hit luke after  lando excludes dre e and he draws a 0 or something. I lose no one besides that mara and he loses all. This was the turning point in the game and I capitalized with big drains. Final move was a gamewinning battle against a lat damged flacon with my super chimara, bosk, guri on stinger and imp command.<br>
FW by 20 something<br>
8(+90 something)<br>
<br>
I see that I&#146;m the only undefeated and my brother who got second does not want to have a final round. I get the vader foil and the top half of the participants get store credit. <br>
It was a fun tourney that finished quick. I made up for some of the ratings points I lost in the past 2 tourneys so I should be 2025 or 230 when iot is updated. Here are the placings as best as I can remember.<br>
<br>
Michael Schiemer(ME) 8)+90 something)<br>
Jimmy Schiemer  6(+56)<br>
Mike Pistone  6(+40 something I think)<br>
Other people i can&#146;t remember their placings.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Afterwards everyone or pretty much everyone drove to the nearby store to buy some packs with their store credit. Most bought RAW DEAL I think. I was going to buy some myself($2.50 a pack isn&#146;t bad) but I forgot my money so I didn&#146;t. <br>
Thats pretty much it so now on to props ans slops.<br>
<br>
PROPS:<br>
-12 who showed.<br>
-Jared for being a good TD and being whipped by his fiance<br>
-Mike Pistone for being a WWF and Raw Deal fan. Good conversations and good game. Congrats on going 3-1.<br>
-My dark for still being undefeated.<br>
-My light for doing better than my dark even though it is much worse.<br>
-My brother Jimmy for going 3-1 and getting 2nd<br>
-Menace fades/battle plan against scum :)<br>
-Imp commands and guri for being unstoppable.<br>
-Mankind for doing what he does best, getting his fatass kicked and still managing to win a match.<br>
-RAW DEAL in general. Fun card game. Have to get my friends into that one.<br>
-Michael Hawley for being cool<br>
-Store that was cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
SLPOS:<br>
-tourney for starting at 2 and being a 4 gamer.<br>

-Hunters for not showing, especially Hayes and his new obsession with L5R.<br>
-Benoit for losing to Micky<br>
-Justin Desai who I though was supposed to come but didn&#146;t.<br>
