Tournaments have been scarce<br>
for a long time, now it seems there is one every week. Not that I&amp;#8217;m complaining. This<br>
report is probably going to be on the long side, so feel free to skip to the games below.<br>
And no one take offense. This was written with a grain of salt, so don&amp;#8217;t take everything<br>
seriously. With a new set playtesting is important. Tatooine didn&amp;#8217;t really provide new<br>
deck types but seemed to help quite a few. Podracing for the lightside blows worse than<br>
Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge. Must be because Sebulba swallow. After playtesting<br>
with /Begin gratutuious @#$% kissing/ Texas State Champ and Hunt Down Master<br>
&amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren/ End @#$% kissing/ , he introduced me to a HDADTJ with racing that<br>
was brutal and a QMC full of paths and tons of other interrupts that was just too good not<br>
to play. After finishing second to Hoostino at a tourney last week doing my best Van<br>
impersonation by losing to Justin twice even though I knew what he was playing, I was<br>
ready to try again without him there. Hoostino tried to help me out even though he wasn&amp;#8217;t<br>
going to be there by dragging me to Denny&amp;#8217;s the night before. Remembering the labor pains I<br>
suffered last time and the black bile that oozed out of my pores last time I refuse and<br>
settle for Reeses PB pie. Much more gooder. Other than the standard horrible service and<br>
drunken rednecks that inhabit Denny&amp;#8217;s at night, nothing too exciting happened.  I<br>
followed my standard tipping rule of leaving 50 cents per tooth, so the waitress actually<br>
owed us money at the end of the night. Off I went to Austin to find an amazing turn-out<br>
of 30 people. That is huge for a local here. States only drew 40+. I saw lots of old faces<br>
and a few new. Always a good sign. My decks were QMC with Tatooine and HDADTJ/Podracing by Hootino. Anyway on to the games:<br>
<br>
Game 1 <br>
DS Huntdown/Pod Race vs. Reid Delfeld (1594) EBO (Strike planning, Insurrection, ?)<br>
<br>
Great , just what I wanted to see. A heavy Space deck when I am light on space.<br>
Oh well, Huntdown is still a machine.  Visage eats away at him as I podrace uncontested<br>
to his low destinies. Tech Mor and Empy come down and sit in the Holotheatre watching<br>
VOTE on the big screen. Gotta be better than the XFL. He flips with Beezer, Madine and<br>
Figgy. I wait till I have 11 cards lost to win the podrace. He deploys Gen Lando in Gold<br>
Squadron 1 to Kiffex. I can&amp;#8217;t have that , so using a tracked 7 with BIHT, I make Lando<br>
bend over for one of what would be many times for me today. I lose Bossk, who I retrieve<br>
with my 11, numbers hits for 6 during the podrace damage, Vader and stick sit at the<br>
podrace arena and the smell of victory is in the air. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just the Colt 45 that<br>
Lando spilled on his way out. After losing 18 cards in one turn combine with another 8 or<br>
so to Visage, Reid had little resources left to challenge me with. From There it was just a<br>
matter of mop-up work. <br>
FW 2 +32<br>
<br>
Highs: This Huntdown is a beast. Few decks play themselves, but even Pauly Shore could<br>
win with this HDADTJ. Isn&amp;#8217;t he dead anyway?<br>
<br>
Lows: With racial tension running high, I hated to beat down Uncle Tom, errr Lando but<br>
it had to happen. The Watts riots were really about the power shortages in LA anyway.<br>
Sucks to live in So. Cal.<br>
<br>
Reid is a good player for the limited cards base he has and always makes a game tough,<br>
especially with his ties. It was good to see him again.<br>
<br>
Game 2 LS QMC vs. Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8220;Weiner&amp;#8221; (1950)  Old School Skrillings ETE<br>
start<br>
<br>
WTF? Who plays this jizz any more. But this is from the guy who created Bantha for<br>
Bubo. I have a bad feeling about skrillings, so Insight never leaves. First turn he deploys<br>
all his sites and draws a few. I throw Epp Obi down, Battle Plan and deploy a site. His<br>
turn , Baby Jabba, Pote Gailid , Scum  hit the table along with Den Of Thieves. Hmm this<br>
doesn&amp;#8217;t look good. I really wish I had a Grimtaash about now. I get Capt Up at the system<br>
with Dash after I flipped and Tunnel for Menace. He drain for about 6 before I get<br>
Menace fades down and deploys 6 skrillings against Obi who pathed far away. He drops a<br>
few  lone skrillings  to various Jabba&amp;#8217;s sites over the next few turns. Feeling brave, I send<br>
Melas, and Epp Luke down to rape one. Uhh barrier Melas, NSP Luke and I can feel my<br>
daily dose of prison lovin coming as he Abyssians for  another skrilling , uses one off the<br>
den and drops 2 more. Melas and 10 is never good. Of that 10 , I lost 2 edges and CC<br>
celebration all in a row from my reserve. Thing went down hill as we pinged each other<br>
for one or 2 and eventually he used the Ornament for 12 or so and won by 18.<br>
FL (-18) 2 +14<br>
Highs: I flipped QMC again. Melas was immune to attrition of 5?&amp;#8217;<br>
<br>
Lows: Where was Qui-Gon? I just made one mistake and Jake capitalized on it. <br>
<br>
Game 3 <br>
HDADTJ vs. Nick Fehring 1486 Slave quarters, podracing start.<br>
<br>
This was going to get nasty real fast. Sebulba owns Anakin and gets off to a good start<br>
with a 5 (8). The holotable with a Monnok also makes an appearance as we both lose to<br>
Visage. This goes on back and forth till turn 4 when my race destiny sits at 30 to his 24. I<br>
deploy DVDLOTS against Jedi Luke and EJP Lando at the Outskirts. Duel Luke with<br>
focused attack. 6,5,7 and it didn&amp;#8217;t matter what he drew. He chooses to turn Luke and lose<br>
6. Lando the pisses himself as he realizes he never should have quit his job at the psychic<br>
friends network. He takes a shot of colt 45 and tries to call his mom, but being the crack<br>
ho she is, the phone sex line is busy. Father and Son show Lando what a good time really<br>
is. Saber swing. Hack. Destiny 6 to his 3 for total of 18 to 6. Lando and 12. Oh and don&amp;#8217;t<br>
forget to lose to Watto&amp;#8217;s Box and Visage for a grand total of 30 cards lost in one turn. Not<br>
pretty at all. Being a glutton for punishment, he put Epp Han and Chewie , protector out<br>
to oppose the Dark Jedi. Choke Chewie, Hack Han and handshake. <br>
FW 2 (+45) 4(+59)<br>
<br>
High: I have never won by so much with the dark. Everything went perfect. <br>
<br>
Lows: It took a whole 10 minutes to play this game and I never like beating somebody by<br>
so much.<br>
<br>
Game 4 LS QMC vs. Conner Bragge ROPS (Mob Points, IAO, First Strike)<br>
<br>
Instead of my usual start of Insight, I started  Don&amp;#8217;t do that again to put the crunch on him<br>
early. I started to set up on CC with EPP Obi, Dash/outrider at the DB and Captain at the<br>
system. He set up and flipped with AT-ST and generic pilots. After a few small drains<br>
here and there, he put Vader and Tarkin at a CC site against Ben who Pathed away. This<br>
was going to get ugly. I had Clash, Melas, Gift Of The Mentor,  RLR, Path and the<br>
Doubler/Tripler card. I tunneled for Luke and deployed Melas. <br>
Tripler, RLR, Clash Vader, Pathed Obi over as Tarkin soiled his depends. It ended up<br>
being 20 to 4, double that and it&amp;#8217;s Tarkin and 32 cards. Game and Handshake. FW 2(+28)<br>
6 (+86)<br>
<br>
Highs: Being able to Tunnel for what I needed to send Tarkin back to the Blue Oyster for<br>
Tango night.<br>
<br>
Lows: Beating a young player by so much.<br>
<br>
Game 5 LS vs. Ted Woodward 1765  Hunter ISB  (Mob Point, IAO, SSPFT) <br>
<br>
Ted is a local who I always have had luck against. He either gets all his ships or no<br>
planets against me and I win. I was counting on my immunity to Ted to pull through<br>
again. I started the Mob Points killer, which was worthless. When Hunter said that it<br>
doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt ISB, he was right. You don&amp;#8217;t argue with the word of the Lord when he has<br>
spoken. Ted dropped Piett, Mejerrik and 2 or 3 systems first turn. Yep, I was glad I<br>
started the Mob Killer. That two force I deprived him was crucial. Whatever. I drop Obi<br>
and give it Ted. I&amp;#8217;m holding Dash and Outrider, Path and ECC Lando, So I&amp;#8217;ll flip next<br>
turn, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to leave Dash in space. He drops Fondor and the Big E, I drop<br>
Dash, the DB, Lando, flip, tunnel for Battle Plan and land Dash. The DB was a last<br>
minute addition for just this reason. He drops a walker and ORS against Dash who paths<br>
away. He also deployed the Devestator with and shuttled Mejerrik and moved them to<br>
Endor. My turn I have a power pivot, Intruder missile, tunnel for Leia, Squassion for the<br>
Falcon and drop on the Devestator. I play the tripler, reduce his power to 0 and win by 10.<br>
It is ruled that in space Han only doubles because the cards requires him to be present.<br>
Fair enough. The bad part was after forfeit he lost 5 card. Not as impressive as I would<br>
have liked.  During this time, Ted asks Brian if I can Path from a Docking bay. He says<br>
yes, but then Ted points out that CC is only exterior. Path targets interior. What docking<br>
bay isn&amp;#8217;t both. Sorry Ted. I thought it was legal at the time or I would have walked Dash<br>
inside with Luke  after I landed the Outrider anyway. We ping each other, he damages the<br>
Falcon and I send Dash back to space to join him with a little back up. He had shuttled<br>
the walker up to the Executor in case I had a few more tricks. He still hadn&amp;#8217;t flipped, so<br>
he shuttled the Walker back the DB. I deployed Ben and Melas, tripler, RLR and this<br>
seems to be very familiar today as this battle hit him for enough cards that he drew his<br>
last 8 or before I could retrieve. FW 2(+25) 8(+111)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning against a bad matchup for me. <br>
<br>
Lows: I felt bad about the misplay, but we all make mistakes. It&amp;#8217;s okay, I&amp;#8217;m not bitter<br>
about you forgetting about Battle Plan or becoming super anal for the rest of the game.<br>
Losing sucks. It&amp;#8217;ll give you something to talk about with Chris on Monday. At least I<br>
learned that if you don&amp;#8217;t declare Dash during the weapon phase, your opponent doesn&amp;#8217;t<br>
have to let you subtract power. <br>
<br>
Jacob was still undefeated at this point, but we played the same side, so I had to rely on<br>
someone else to try to beat him, while I drew a TD from the Waco area.<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
Michael Richards 1523<br>
DS HDADTJ vs. Dagobah Mains (Insight, Insurrection and ?)<br>
<br>
I was disappointed in Richards. Usually he has some crazy teched out tech that rocks.<br>
Boring Dagobah mains this time. He did have Anakins Podracer to challenge me with. I<br>
set up with monnok at the Holotable and did some Visage damage. Sebulba got off to his<br>
usual head start and never looked back. He did cancel visage once, but I redeployed in<br>
instantly. He played Throw me another charge. No Charge, imagine that. Podracer<br>
collision let me put OOC/TT #2 out of play. Visage would stay through out the remainder<br>
of the game. I had Empy, a number and Tech, but he never ditched insight. I did win the<br>
podrace, used Podracer collision to place an Off the Edge out of play and bury his other<br>
retrieval means. He placed Qui-Gon at the Cantina who I let drain, while he deployed EJP<br>
Lando and Ben Kenobi/Stick against my Emp and Vader/Stick.  He just didn&amp;#8217;t know that<br>
Lando was my @#$% all day long. The focused attack and Circle in my hand were more<br>
excited than the Bush Twins at an open bar. Circle Ben, Rape Lando for another 10 or so<br>
cards and that was game after a minor skirmish with a lone Corran that let me put my Leis<br>
in hand back in my used pile. FW 2(+25)  10(+136)<br>
<br>
Well Jake held on to win going undefeated with a difference of 156 or some crap like<br>
that. I picked up a nice Sense foil for my effort all the same. With the new set, I noticed<br>
that podracing can really disrupt any body&amp;#8217;s strategy, but is more powerful for the dark.<br>
Also, the Mob point killers didn&amp;#8217;t frighten anybody as I saw 6 ISB decks(A few Space<br>
Cowboys from Hell among others) and even a Hidden Mains or 2. Darth Maul made an<br>
appearance in every person&amp;#8217;s deck that owned him, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t always successful in<br>
dueling. You need to track people. Or load your deck with destinies. Destiny will always<br>
win you games. Or if your name is Matt Lush and you use Marquand you will auto win as<br>
well, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen that lately. Can&amp;#8217;t have a report from Killeen without a little name<br>
dropping.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
<br>
Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8221;Weiner&amp;#8221;  for Damn good hot-dogs. Oh yeah and winning too.<br>
Justin &amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren who without his lack of a life these awesome decks never<br>
would have evolved to be today. <br>
Brain Guthrie  for running another great tourney. Hate to see you go. <br>
My wife for granting parole for a day.<br>
Your Mom. She knows why.<br>
Brian Hunter for being right about the Mob points killer and letting Van lose to him all<br>
the time. <br>
All 30 people who came out. Hopefully we have more turnouts like this<br>
Halle Berry for earning an extra 500,000 for going topless in Swordfish.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
<br>
Ted for being Ted<br>
Me for making 2 mistakes by deploying Melas (your welcome, Jake) and pathing from<br>
the DB<br>
The Reeses pie for only being good enough for second. But at least I can still eat solid<br>
food. After the brownie that can be a struggle.<br>
Our Denny&amp;#8217;s server for being abducted by a UFO or what ever happens to trailer trash in<br>
the middle of our meal when she disappeared and never came back.<br>
Justin&amp;#8217;s Ego which continues to swell. <br>
The Army for inventing places like Korea, NTC and Hell.<br>
Van for not being able to beat Hunter after playtesting all week and teching with Mech<br>
failure. Your still my hero.<br>
Swordfish for being another crappy Travolta movie. Hack**Battlefield<br>
Earth**ughmmpfh.<br>
