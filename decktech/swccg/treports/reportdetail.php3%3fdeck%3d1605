<br>
<br>
      Sorry for being a little late but I didn&#146;t think I was going to write a report.Anyways , on to rest of the report.<br>
             Pre tourney<br>
<br>
      I was a little unsure about both of my decks coming into the tournament. For my light side deck I had a new age throne room deck(w/o sac) with home one and friends for space and mains and portals for the ground.This was topped off with lots of on and off the edges.My dark deck was a little better being a hunt down battler.This deck depended a lot on visage and S+d for damage but enforced S+D big time and had 4 extra visages.It had no ships but it had decree , ice plains, and wampa cave with a crap load of characters to combat the popular EBO.The tourneys here usually have only 10 or 15 people but 26 or 27 showed up. It was very crowded in the small playing area and as the title suggested it smelled nasty(must have been the surrounding Magic players). My rating going into the tournament was 1993.<br>
<br>
      Game 1 my dark versus Jimmy Schiemer(1730&#146;s)New age throne room with DBs,2 twixs , and little or no space.<br>
<br>
   I already knew the outcome of this game because he is my brother and I beat him during this last matchup.I basicly set up vader at db while I drew cards like IG, Janus and mara.He lost a few to visage but eventually put down a luke and scrubs.I put down some guys including dr e, IG88, and 4LOM.During his turn I disarmed and operated luke. This cycle repaeted itself as I battled and retrieved my disarmeds and kept beating on his scrubs and disarming his EPPs.My tempests and blizzards also made a show trampling obi and chewie with the help of janus and a tracked visage.This went on with S+D and draining and visage to win the game.Full win by 23.<br>
2(+23)<br>
<br>
     Game 2 my light versus ??? Defel, mains, and sac deck with tatoine and sunsdown start.<br>
<br>
     I knew I would win this game when for the forst 5 turns or so he just activated 3 or 4 force.By then I had mains at the CCdb and I was generating about 15 force. I then got out home one at his tat. system with launching the assault on tat. with 3 pilots including the anti lat damage one.He got out some tat. sites with defels at them and I just put some mains down to block their drains and make them hide. Some mains like vader and tarkin showed but all my crap was immune to his sac.I just battled to stall while I drained for 4 a turn , killed his mains, and retrieved with on/off the edges.Full win by 30.<br>
4(+53)<br>
<br>
Game 3My light versus Hayes Hunter(2141)&#146;s BHBM beats with lots of sac and pretty decent space.<br>
<br>
     I was pretty sure I would lose this game since I was playing my light side deck but I wasn&#146;t sure.I started off good with a twix and a scrub out and then he got his normal carida , emporer, DSII DB. I fortified my db with han and LSJK from reserve deck than drew. He got out his lord with saber and moved him with the emporer to his CC db. I got out my CCdb put a leia with gun there with jereon webb and put a twass with my db scrub while luke moved to his father. I moved over Han w/gun to leia and webb and drew up.The game goes pretty unebventful from there with him killing my mains with lucky trample destinys and him battling with first strike much of the time.I couldn&#146;t find obis or kessels the whole game so I was forced to retreat to Home one db with my lone leia and put Home one with ackbar, hassyn, and other mon cal pilot at carida with launching the assault. The game proceeded to him drainming on CC for 4 a turn and battling me at carida. This didn&#146;t do much but he did cancel some drains and make me put some cards on insignificant rebellion.The system was finally cleared but I was only draining for two and my on the edges were being sensed even with DODN on table.It was too late to make any comeback with no ground force and large damage being taken.Full Loss by 18<br>
4(+35).<br>
<br>
Game 4 my Dark versus Justin Desai(1820&#146;s or 1810&#146;s) and his classic MWYHL,super falcon, on the edges, afas, and mains.<br>
<br>
    I had a great start with visage and S+D doing some good damage but then he got capt. han and wedge on their ships to kessel.He then got some mains and sub mains down to tat. desert to stop S+D and visage damge.I beat the crap out of them(not really) with some bounty hunters and mara but i lost most of them in the battle as he did with his charaqcters.Obi came down during his turn and cleared the site before dying to attrition himself.Visage damage and S+D damage started up again but drains at kessel and uncontrollable fury on vader were killing me. He also killed all my visages a few turns before the end of the game.He then finished me off when he tracked a 7 and OTE and inserted an afa.It was really close but the on the edge and his uncontrollable fury gave him the win.Full loss by 7.<br>
4(+28.)<br>
<br>
Lows: I have to do some lows for this game.I couldn&#146;t find my you are beatens, projections, or janus when I needed them.<br>
Highs:good start.<br>
<br>
Game 5 my light versus Jimmy Schiemer(1730&#146;s) hunt down battling deck.<br>
<br>
    This outcome was also obvious. I got out honor early with a twix and a scrub. He lost to visage about 10 times before he got no escape out.I just set up a super Home 1 at kessel with launching the assault while I battled to grab a foothold on the ground and retrieved with on/off the edge.I took his minor draind of 1 or 2 and blocked his other with a mains hit squad. We just fought until my drains and battlin with retrieval wore him down.Full win by 22.<br>
6(+50)<br>
<br>
Game 6 with my dark deck versus John Shapiero(spelling?)(1623 I think) and his crazy elom and mains agents deck.<br>
<br>
    I knew this would be an interesting game since John is always an improving player and has some interesting decks to face.  It was a very fast game with me getting out ice plains and a first turn vader. I had him protected by a barrier and a put all sections on alert.He put down master luke at the desrt and I responded next turn with IG,4LoM, and janus.I played first strike and blast door controls and battled.with jabbas through with you gining me a total of 3 battle destiny I was in good shape.I drew some luckily high destiny and he drew a five. He lost luke and some while I lost Janus.He the went for an elom beatdown against my vader. I barriered one but 3 more deployed and be battled me. I hit one and drew a six so all I lost was vader and he lost all but the barriered elom.Next turn with a huge amount of force I dropped down another vader, maraw/saber, and some other guys and battled the lone elom. He lost the elom and 17 more cards so that was basically game.I finished it up by draining and setting up a drain at desert with my abandoned droids and a walker.S+D was deployed.He put one more main at my Db with mara but i barriered. I cycled some cards back into my deck with put all sections on alert and first strikeand when that main went down, the visage and S+D started up again.I drained him out with these for my aids.Full win by 30.<br>
8(+80)<br>
<br>
So I don&#146;t end up doing that bad at the end and I get 5th place. Here are the tourny standings:<br>
1.Hayes Hunter 6-0(Of course)<br>
2.Eric Hunter 5-1(only lost to his brother) <br>
3.Matt ???(I am stupid)  5-1 (new blood in the top three)<br>
4.Steve Baroni 4-2(won so many games by over 30 its incredible)<br>
5.Me 4-2<br>
<br>
