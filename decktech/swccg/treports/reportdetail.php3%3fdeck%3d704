We head inside with them and go to the room that we were going to use for the tournaments and it is about 95 degrees in their(no AC).  I see Mike Dalton, Doug Faust, a couple of people I don't know, and Charlie Herren who I recognize from his DeckTech photo.  There is no way we can play all night in this room, so Scott starts looking around and finds an empty classroom we can use that is AC-good work.  There are twelve people for the first tournament.  I had built 4 decks, a HB/Tat Mains deck, my Huntdown/noduel on endor deck, and a LS and DS operative deck-which i believed sucked but wanted to see if they could still work well.  The DS ops deck was the Clint Hays Raithal Odds deck, with a couple of card changes.  I was rated 1849 at the start of the weekend(a 65 point drop from the 1914 I was rated a month ago-I had been playtesting some new decks at local events which blew.)<br>
<br>
Tournament 1 3pm:<br>
Game 1 vs Michael Blythe's(1648) Court deck<br>
	Mike was one of the guys that I had never met before, seeing as he was from Michigan.  This was the 2nd reason that I came to RCon, to play some people that I had never played before(the 1st being the top level of competition, 3rd being all the foils up for grabs)  Mike is an incredibly funny guy, and I just read his edited report forwarded by Mike Dalton and that doesn't even begin to show just how funny he is.  This game let me work out the kinks in how I play my deck.  It was HB/tat mains/OMDH(not the Matt Lush deck, I don't see the need for that much SAC or Celebration).  Game starts off slow, he started Scum, I started Goo(not every character is going to be a BH, so it'll work fine).  He pulls Jabba out first turn for his 5 force-goo worked already.  I drop Tawss khaa, battle and jabba dies, but I can't cancel scum. I also deployed the Tat system from my reserve deck(oops). He used Court to pull DB 94 and then he drops someone to the AC with Boelo and kills tawss.  I don't have any characters except jek Porkins in my hand, but I do have red 6, so I drop porkins to the docking bay, deploy red 6 there, put him in it and take off to avoid losing 1 to court(i have spiral and a barrier in hand for zuckuss), and then draw the rest. sure enough here comes zuckuss, and gets the barrier.  next comes the spiral and lando in falcon and zuckuss dies, I lose spiral.  he saves up, and then pulls fett in slave 1, deploys the bus, battles and retrieves zuckuss.  this pattern continues for a couple of turns, with him battling in space and retrievinng the ships he lost and then pulling them from reserve deck.  I'm getting stupid-must be from finals, my brain can only hold so much info.  I abandon the system.  I drop Ben and Luke to the AC, clear it and cancel scum, put OMDH on Alderaan, target jek and run and retrieve.  I've got the ground, he has the system.  I retreived all my ships, track them and draw them back, deploy them again, move jek back to set up one final retrieval since we are evenly draining.  I lose my capitals when he battles, pull off another OMDH, he's down to about 5 cards so he just ends it. FW +17<br>
2+17<br>
<br>
highlights:playing someone new, someone funnier than me.<br>
lowlights:underestimating the ability of Scum/Court-glad I got the kinks out of my head early.<br>
<br>
Game 2 HD vs Jason Lembo's(1833) HB/Tat mains.<br>
	There goes the idea of playing someone new.  On top of being a fellow SM, Jason is also my cousin and one of my roommates at Rutgers University.  We had been playtesting against each other for about 3 days, and he was pretty sure this was a bad matchup.  He goes first, pulls a nudj and deploys goo from hand.  I have no Vader in opening hand.  I go, pull Exec DB, and deploy bubo to kill his nudj since there were 0 vaders in my force pile.  He activates and draws.  I activate, look for a DB, none there, but I know there is a vader in force pile, and now so does Jay.  I draw for him and find 2 sites.  Jay can't find a terminated to cancel visage or a spy and is getting frustrated.  I get Vader out to Endor and flip, then alter goo.he brings Luke and Han, barrier.  I add some guys, we battle, scrubs die, his mains die, he can't find more.  not a very exciting game, but quick enough that we can both go hit the vending machines.  fw +21<br>
4+38<br>
Highlights: beating a guy that knew 95% of my deck<br>
lowlights: playing Jay, not the reason I came up here.<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Charlie Herren's(1953) HD/duel<br>
	I was expecting RalOps, I got HD duel.  great, this LS doesn't have my anti-duel cards.  I got to play someone new, although this would be the first of 4 games this weekend that charlie and I would play.  He dropped Vader to the DS docking bay.  I put Ben Kenobi down to the Cantina, cancelled Visage.  he picks up vader, then redeploys next turn, duels Obi, he draws a 5 and 7, I draw a 6 and a......1.  damn, obi's gone, i'm in trouble with crap in hand, so I start drawing.  1st card is Obi's saber(would have been nice-still would have lost the duel by 1, but maybe he wouldn't have dueled if I was going in 4 up on him).  Game was over real quick after ben died as I was playing catch-up.  FL -24<br>
4+14<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs Charlie Herren's(1953) Y4 mains<br>
	Hey, I play Charlie again.  let's see if I can get some redemption.  look at the opening hand and oh s&amp;^), i'm screwed.  no vader's, no ships, no characters.  he goes first, nudj, yadda, 2/0 sites, yadda, terminated.  I pull DB-all vaders in reserve deck.  he sets up a drain, i pull another DB-still no Vader's in force pile.  two turns later I finally get Vader and and another Visage.  drop to Endor and flip. EPP beat squad, vader goes down, I go to space, and get some draining, visage is hurting us both. can't find another vader, what the hell is the point of playing 5 if you can't find 1!!??  I lose by about 15, but charlie forgot to count before picking up his cards, doesn't really matter since he is the only 4-0. he says 1<br>
FL -1(4+13)<br>
<br>
Charlie wins the first tournament, I know the couple of cards I need to change for tomorrow since I'm pretty sure this is what I'm playing, Gogolen's Scum isn't quick enough for DS.  I decide that I want to play the 2 operative decks to see if they still work. I drive Scott to the train station to pick up bart robinson and we run into Juz, Kevin, and Dan in the parking lot.  We walk them inside, then run back out to get bart who's been waiting for about 30 minutes.  More people have arrived, including half of team albany.  We have 27 players for tournament #2 since Matt Sokol and a few other albanites opted not to play<br>
<br>
Game 1 DS vs Travis Desell's(1683) Y4 mains/revo<br>
	I start Raithal and jungle, he deploys nudj and revos the system. F^&amp;#, I lose.  I know for a fact that their is no way I can win this game after that, but let's see what I can cut him down too.  I active and draw to get an odds. He deploys Lando in falcon to raithal, oola, and wedge.  The luck of this kid is ridiculous.  I insert for the hell of it, deploy some troopers to the swamp, and let him go.  he sends down epp obi since he gets about 15 with the 2/0 sites he happened to get out so early, battles. I play trooper assault, sense, another one, sense, a third one goes through. he missed swinging at a 2/2 guy, so I lose one of the jobbers.  I don't draw so Obi has to stay on table.  I activate, run like hell, and hope I can gets some odds to pop to cause him to have at least 4 cards in his lost pile.  It pops, he follows, the pattern repeats twice more, until Han and Luke kill the rest of my guys.  What took him so long? <br>
FL- 27<br>
Highlights: Cutting him down to 27<br>
Lowlights:the whole game was equally low. Losing to someone from Albany<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs Thomas hermley-keen's(1688) Court deck.<br>
	Forget playing the LS ops deck, I decide to play the tat mains again.  I see he plays court and decide that was a good call, since I would probably only be able to deploy boussh from the ops deck to tatooine(ops and speeders don't work off their planet too well, unless it's speeder beat down).  Game starts off slow, we're both setting up, losing to Court for two turns.  he deploys to AC, I use Ben and Luke to clear him out.I then convert his tat sites, force choking a bit.  we agree that his generation is a problem.  Tom can't find much to count those two with, and I use Lando in Falcon with Wedge piloting to pull off an OMDH.  He had lost most of his ships in battle damage at the AC.  Only a matter of time, and I can retrieve all night.  Win by 32<br>
2+5<br>
Highlights:my deck showing it's flexibilty<br>
lowlights:playing someone local, with 28 people in the room this room-10 of whom are from local NJ- and I play someone I already know.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 Ls vs Bart Robinson's(1698) Endor deck<br>
	He start with the 2 2/1 sites.  first turn he deploys a 2/2 guy at each and search and destroy.  I deploy Tawss khaa and kill one of the guys, retrieving my signal, and cancelling S&amp;D, and let him have his other drain.  He drains two, and draws.  I throw down EPP Luke and kill that guy.  He draws for a turn or two and saves some force to counter.  He does some battle damage to luke, but I set up OMDH and retrieve it all and then some.  I just drain him out of the game and pull off retrieval.  I know about how much I have left and feel like a jacka$$ for winning by that much against a guy that I went to the train station with scott to pick up.  FW +41<br>
4(+46)<br>
Highlights:nothing stands out as spectacular.<br>
lowlights: retrieving my entire lost pile when there was no need to, feeling like an ass for doing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 DS vs Charlie herren's y4 mains deck.<br>
	ding, round 3 against Charlie.  I know there is absolutely no way I can with with this DS deck, and I don't know how Clint ever did.  I understand why he threw it away at the Detroit GS(I think it was this deck, someone correct me if I'm wrong).  I do some insert damage, but my guys have trouble staying alive.  I can;t find a trooper assault to keep them alive.  My inserts do some damage, but not nearly enough early on and then he gets ultimatum working.  I don't really have any strong enough characters to battle with to get him off the 3rd battleground.  lose by 15<br>
4(+31)<br>
<br>
Highlights:cutting him down to 15<br>
lowlights:the deck not working anymore(maybe it never did, I don't know-Clint did ok with it at the philly grand slam)<br>
<br>
Well it's about 11:30 so we decide to head on home and get some sleep.  I get one pack of Wb dagobah as prize support and decide that whatever the rare is I'm going to put it in my deck just for the hell of it.  Check out my Day 2 report to find out what it was and how I actually used it twice against 2 2000 rated players.<br>
<br>
Props: <br>

-John Lolli for telling Rich that a hot girl just walked by the door, then when Rich went to check, john yelled out 'hey baby, look at me in the black T-shirt', or something like that.<br>

-Charlie Herren for beating me 3 times in one day<br>
-Mike Blythe for the funniest game I've played in a long time(Wojchiech and I would have a great game in Day 2, almost as good-read the next report for that one)<br>
