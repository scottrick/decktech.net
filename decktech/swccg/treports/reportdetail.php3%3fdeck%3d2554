Art Rhodes gets off work and is able to make it over too.  I play against him a couple times and he has a cool LS deck but I did pretty well against it due to his lack of Podracing cards which woulda made a big difference.  We shoot some pool and end up talk about how bad DS is.  He mentions that there is a local tourney in Columbia in 2 days so all of a sudden Team Augusta will be going.  As for decks, I will be taking the Raider deck whose record is 17-1.  And for DS I spent some time trying come up with a Scum deck that starts Podracing and the one effect is Expand the Empire instead of Wattos Box, but I ditched that in favor of my HD Racing deck(5-1).  I took out the numbers package and in went 2 Mauls and 2 Maras.  The HD is probably the best deck at present for Dark Side and it wins really fast too.  So Landon decides not to go but Jim, Nick, Carmine, and I make the 1 ½ hour trip to Columbia for a 6-game tournament:<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
My HD Racing vs. TJ Crolleys QMC Mains<br>
<br>
I start all the HD stuff including Epic Duel, and all the Podracing stuff including Wattos Box.  He started Squadron Assignments, Strike Planning(he never used it), and Keeping the EOF.  Though he really couldn;t keep the empire out I suppose.  I activate and stack a twilek as race destiny(he stacked stuff every turn even though he had no Ani&amp;#8217;s Pod, not sure why).  Then, put my EPP Vader at the Guest Quarters and make him lose to Visage.  He activates and drops Daughter of Skywalker with Anis stick for 5 and spends his last force to battle instead of getting a site out.  I hit Daughter and cause some overflow while he misses me and kills Vader by attrition.  So he has no force and Vader is the only card in my lost pile, and he has a TT/OOC in hand but uses it to cancel Visage instead of waiting 2 turns to spend one and try to put Vader out of play(33% chance due to me losing to more cards to Visage).  So we both lose to Visage, and I put out another Vader out at Leias Hutt.  His turn he loses to Visage, pulls West Gallery, and draws.  I drain, put out the AC pulling Mara, and move Vader over so he cant drop Leia for &amp;#8211;2.  I draw a Bossk in Bus and Maul(sweet!).  He puts Cracken in ship to Bespin, Blount to Leias Hutt, pulls Landos CC Hutt, puts Crix there, Flips, and moves Blount over to Crix.  So the sites are arranged West Gallery(Vader), Leias Hutt(empty), and Landos Tunnel place(Crix/Blount).  I keep hitting him with Visage and 2 drains of 1.  I bring down Bossk and play Start Yor Engines to leave a 6 on top and kill Cracken and his ship losing Bossk.  Maul comes down to Crix and Blount to drain there.  I win the Podrace and get 11 as he loses 11.  He puts down Qui Gon w/ stick at Leias Hutt.  The rest of the game consists of him Pathing Qui Gon away and both of us losing to Visage.  Finally he disarms Vader and brings down Premeire Obi w/ Stick.  He has 3 cards in reserve.  He battles Vader and misses the swing.  I play Circle and Focused Attack and draw 7, 4, and 1(no stick bonus) due to R2-Q2 in my last draw phase.  He stares at the Courage of A Skywalker in his hand and the one card in his reserve deck which was a Luke Stick.  I cross Obi and win by 32.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
My WYS Raiders vs. Andrew Gilmers HD Racing<br>
<br>
I start Insurrection, Squadron Assignments, AIM HIGH, and Ains Pod.  He starts the same stuff my deck does.  His turn he drops Empy to the Podrace Arena and also Dark Path(ugh!). My hand contained 2 Raiders and 2 Crafts.  I pulled the &lt;&gt;DB and put it on the other side of the Arena.  I dropped one pair of Raider/Crafts to each docking bay and draw all.  My flip cut his activation from ten down to seven. His turn DLOTS comes down to the DB:94 and he flips then moves him into the Podrace Arena and stays flipped even though it isnt a battleground.  I lose off the top to Visage and its a TT/OOC so down goes Visage never to be redployed.  As for the Podrace, I am getting butchered due to bad draws and him using Dark Path.  So I put out Dash and Mirax in the Outrider to Tatooine with Celebration, Battle Plan, Menace Fades, and Ill take the leader(the lock).  He puts Mara into the Cantina and Maul w/ stick to the Generic DB.  I put down Kessel with the Falcon, Captain Han, and Melas.  So I sit there and drain and block his cantina drain with Bargaining Table.  He cant due anything for 2 turns due to his wanting to save force for the Race.  So I drain and get ready to get hit hard.  I have Jedi Luke and On the Edge in hand with Mirax on table.  So he haws saved up to 18 force.  He drops Fett in Slave 1 in front of the Falcon and retrieves 11 and I lose 11 bringing me down to about 7 cards.  I Mirax in his draw phase and activate to the Jedi Luke and on the Edge Han for 5.  I can only retrieve 1 with Celebration due to Maul but the one is On the Edge.  So basically I have a loop going where I activate to my only Edge card, Mirax it, and then activate 5 more(the force retrieve last turn), and then Jedi Luke is on top of Reserve.  Then I on the edge Han for 5 and retrieve the Edge with Celebration.  No grabber or secret plans comes, so this process continues for the rest of the game.  I kill Fett in Slave 1 on my turn.  He cant do anything else from there on out.  At one point I spent a force and put the Jedi Luke on top of the force spent so I kill Han accidently with my Edge card.  But the game is over anyway, and I win by 21.  Andrew was a great player and a nice guy when it came to letting me take back actions.  His deck was really cool but he told me he used Dark Path too much and couldnt draw his ships.  FW by 21.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
My Raiders vs. Nick Arcas SYCFA Ties<br>
<br>
This game was pretty boring so Ill make it short.  I started Aim High and choked him with a first turn flip.  He now could only activate 1 at Death Star and Death Star War Room.  I put a Raider at every single site on table including the Cantina and War Room.  I put Dash and Melas in Outrider at the DS:DB and move up to the system.  I move the Falcon with Captain Han and 2 raiders since he has only two cards in hand.  He already has a Dreadnaught and 2 ties draining at Tatooine.  He has no tie cannon or Lat Damage so im fine.  He drops another tie and I barrier and he battles playing all power to weapons.  He draws a 0 for BD and I draw 3 BD totalling a 9.  He loses the Dread and both ties leaving his barriered tie stranded.  My turn I wail on it and win the game but only by 21cuz I didnt want to sit there doing celebration on him every turn.  FW by 21.<br>
<br>
Our team heads to Zaxbys and I find out Carmine is in the lead at 3-0, Im 3-0, Jims 2-1, and Nicks 2-1.  Zaxbys felt the need to charcoal burn my texas toasts.  Thanks a bunch!!  They suck.  <br>
<br>
Game 4:<br>
My HD Racing vs. Nick Arcas HB Xwings<br>
<br>
Well I helped him make the deck last night so I &amp;#8220;THOUGHT&amp;#8221; I remembered where his HB was LOL.  So this game was boring just like last so I wont go into detail.  I put down JP, and pull the AC and put Mara there.  Vader goes to JP.  I send Fett with Maul inside to prevent any drain at kessel for the rest of the game(cool!!).  I probe Kessel(wrong), Endor(wrong), Bothuwai(right!).  He makes fun of me cuz I was the one who helped him build the deck last night, hehe.  I put Bossk and Zuckuss at Kiffex to drain.  So I drain 5 a turn plus Visage for the rest of the game while he drains me<br>
 for 1 and 1 at Sullust and Endor.  He drops Obi to my Vader but I Circle with Focused Attack so he loses nine.  And then I win the podrace in the same turn, yay!  FW +24(drew a lot to get Maul and ships)<br>
<br>
So after the game we all start watching the TD play Carmine.  Ive never even played Jedi Testing so I watched the TD stack Artoo in Red 5 for Test 5 and play on the edge for 6 3 times in a row.  Carmine kinda thought I was helping him but I was really just trying to find out how the deck works. The TD gets test 6 completed and is flipped and pulls Luke into hand.  Carmine plays SENSE/Uncertain is the Future to make him redraw his 1 card hand.  Course you cant play SENSE with the MWYHL objective flipped and I knew Carmine would get mad if I sad anything so I didnt.  And the TD didnt catch it so it went through! WOW!  The game ended up timing and the TD had 20 to Carmines 19 so the TD won anyway.  Carmine misplaced his Bubo and coulda won I guess but noones perfect(see my probing last game!).<br>
<br>
Game 5:<br>
My Raiders vs. Carmines MKOS Racing<br>
<br>
I start The Camp, Aim High, Squadron Ass., and good old Anis pod.  He blanks me first turn and draws a 3.  He drops ETE and pulls a 5 JP sites and draws.  I drop the a Raider/Craft to JP and put Dash in Outrider at &lt;&gt;DB and fly up.  He drops Zuckuss and 4Lom and battles.  I drop his power to 0 and he happens to draw a 4 and 4 for destiny so I must lose Both.  Dang, So I drop Wedge and ship after tunneling for cannons.  Shoot Down zuckuss and draw.  So he ends up winning the Podrace by 2 due to him having Collisions and me not packing any Racing interrupts.  I lose 11 and he gets 11 back(again, this really hurts).  I put a Raider at the Desert Heart, both my DBs, JP, Entrance Cavern for big drains.  He cant due much due to The Camp.  I also put down Battle Plan, Menace Fades, Ill take the Leader, and Celebration.  So after the race I come back quickly by celebrating 5 a turn.  He keeps on bringing down battle characters like Mara, Iggy, Myo, Ephant and others. But barrier, portal, dodge and it&amp;#8217;s a trap keep my little raiders nice and safe.  FW by +34.<br>
<br>
Well here is the deal.  Carmine is 3-2 and Jim is 4-1 but I cant play Jim because we played the same sides.  I figure Jim will win with high diff so if I can win game 6, then I win.  But if I lose game 6, then whoever has higher diff out of Jim and I will win.<br>
<br>
Game 6:<br>
My DS Racing vs. Carmines Standard WYS Racing w/ Harvest<br>
<br>
So I must say I am pretty ticked at having to play 4 games in a row vs. the Arca brothers!  But oh well, I guess if only 12 people attend that is how it goes.  His 1 effect is Insurrection and I figure out that if I can not start Wattos box then the race wont be a big difference and I can still lose it and win the game or lessen his Diff with Visage and still win with big diff over Jim.  So I opt for Secret Plans instead of the Box cuz he plays like every retrieval card possible.  I activate and burn his race destiny and blindly draw a Visage!  Wow, I draw some cards to get Vader and Mara and Bubo.  He activates, puts down kessel with the &lt;&gt;DB to it, and the Lars farm, and draws.  I am doing Visage the entire game cuz the one time he cancelled it I put it out the turn after.  My turn I draw a random 6 for Racing while carmine draws 3 decent ones and places two.  I put EPP Vader at the Farm and save 1 for barrier.  He puts Outrider for free and then Dash, so I barrier it and he has to reinforce with a RFC.  Bubo comes down and eats Dash Mara kills the RFC and transits with Bubo to the TatDB.  I now realize that Creatures CANNOT use DB Transit but in the glossary I had looked up creature movement and not DB Transit.  And creatures could move as long as within their Habitat but I now realize I was wrong, Sorry Carmine.  Bubo didnt do anything on tatooine anyway.  So Mara gets her stick and moves in the Cantina.  I play Start Your Engines to put a 6 on top and draw it for Race destiny and I have a 7-6-6 and Carmine has like 13 total.  So I win in my move phase since he hasnt drawn any A Step Backwards.  I have 6 cards in lost pile so I get them all back and he loses 6.  In the matchup the night before I had lost the podrace and thats why I didnt start the box.  Guess I shoulda.  So Mara moves in the Cantina for a drain of 3 and Vader is stilll draining for two at the farm and Visage is still doing its thing.  He puts thereon in ship at kessel with cannons as a last ditch effort.  But I respond with Boba carrying Maul(huge!) and he cant shoot me or do anything.  So he ends up coming to the Cantina against my lone Mara in his final last ditch effort.  He brings EPP Luke and ECC Lando.  So I Obsession targeting Mara.  We both have ability 5 and have our sticks BUT I played focused attack so I have an extra draw which will also be +1.  He decides to place luke out of play and lose 15 to end it.  FW +35.<br>
<br>
Jim wins his last game going 5-1.  His TRMains old school goes 3-0!  Nudges are cool I guess.  Raider deck jumps to 20-1. So I went 6-0 and chose the Twilek Advisor Foil instead of the Snowspeeder Foil which randomly went to Nick Arca.  I have the Twilek Advisor Foil, BB Jap Foil Vader, Jap Anis Stick, and a bunch of other Japanese stuff like On the Edge and Dr.E and Gift of the Mentor on ebay.  Just go look at auctions for the UserID of lbmyers1 and you should find all my auctions in a list at very cheap prices(thats LBMYERS1).  Enough pathetic solicitation, back to the TR.  We end up getting lost on the way home but the Crown Victoria stays true and gets us home eventually.  We are probably going to keep attending tourneys there as long as we are given advanced notice.  It was a very fun event and thanks go to Jeremy Rolley for running it and doing a good job on his Lab Top with the command cards and such. Thanks to Jim, Nick, and Carmine for making the trip exciting.  Ill never forget the Thermal Detonator/Sniper to kill Podracers argument we had!  See you all at the Atlanta DPC! <br>
