<br>
-Prologue-<br>
<br>
Well as of last week, Tuesday to be percise, i&#146;m sitting at my desk and I get an email from someone so I go and open it and it&#146;s from my friend Ernest who I haven&#146;t spoken with in about a year. He informs me that he&#146;s coming into town for about a week tomorrow and so since tomorrow was the gaming night I told him in email to get his cards and show up so we can play. Well Ernie in his infinte wisdom forgot his cards and said that he would still like to show up and hang out. So of couse since it was gaming night no matter what we met at Rustys. (that&#146;s where we play Star Wars, Star Trek and JK as well as that lame game Magic. :))<br>
<br>
So shortly after my final in Computer Networking I get to Rustys and see Ernie and Chris and Adam and their playing cards Adam vs Chris since Ernie didn&#146;t bring his and we shot the shiznit and I showed Ernie how to play JK and that&#146;s when he wanted to know if there was a tournament that was coming up and of course my tournament isn&#146;t till next week (er.. this week) so I said non that I know of but I checked online and then got a call from him and told him that there was one that was taking place in Los Angeles, and he wanted to go, but of course since he has no decks we have to make him some. So the next night I catch up with him again and we hang out and do some friend stuff and make plans for Friday so that he can come over and make some decks with my cards so that we can go to the tournament. We meet up Friday with Wilson and he plays against him, ofcourse this being Ernies first time playing in sometime he got his butt handed to him so we re-vamped his decks some and then we were all good.<br>
<br>
So Saturday comes around and I pick Ernie up for the tournament at 10:00 and head down to LA about an hour 1/2 drive (normally, ~smirk~) After getting some gas and some munchies for the trip we get out of SB about 10:45 and head on the road, now as some of you may know that the drive down to a tournament is the most boring thing in the world to me and this was no exception especially since I didn&#146;t have a radio in my Jeep anymore since I made the asine mistake of putting the face plate back on my tray (at McDonalds) and then dumping it in the trash... D&#146;oH! and then when I went back they found and held it up asking if that was it and with the Coke, Ketchup and Mustard coming off it I nodded yes and well that was history. So I need a new stero suffice to say.<br>
<br>
So we get to LA for the tournament to only find out that we are actually an hour early because the tournament was supposed to start at 1:00, oh and we made it to LA with about 15 minutes to spare (11:45 - thinking that the tournament was starting at 12:00). Well were sitting there and a couple of people show up for the tournament and yet still no TD for the tournament again thinking that the tournament was supposed to start at 12:00 that&#146;s when I find out that it starts at 1:00 so sitting there I bust out my Tatooine cards and start showing them to the owner of the store and the other players to get them psyched on the new cards and then start showing them to all the players as they enter and their all cool and stuff. I decided that at the end of the tournament I would give out some Commons and Uncommons and so I do. Also, while I wait I make some more trades for soem Garindans and now I have 1043 thanks to some people that held them for me... Adam you the bomb... re: Adam Montgomery, who had 6 for me and 1 Japanese.<br>
<br>
So anyhow after were all there and things are ready to start I put the Tatooine away and get the decks, now mind you this is the first tournament that I played in in sometime. So bear with me. I was playing: Imbalancing BHBM (standard start: Mobilization Points, Imperial Arrest Order, Something Special Planned For Them) and TIGIH/Scouts (standard start: Strike Planning, Do Or Do Not &amp; Wise Advice, Insurrection) both REALLY fun decks....<br>
<br>
GAME 1: Dark vs Adam Montgomery&#146;s Light Side Hidden Base<br>
First I would like to say that&#146;s indeed fun to play Adam, even thou I am 0-4 vs him (at least after this game I am) Adams start is standard for Hidden Base, Squassi, Strike Planning and something else that doesn&#146;t really bother me all that much and my normal start that I always do. I start with with Rendili in my hand, Death Star 2:Docking Bay in my hand, Tatooine: Docking Bay in my hand and I&#146;m like DAMN!!!! what a crap as well I have Force Lightning....so first turn I activate, grab the Emperor, drop him at the Death Star 2: DB and then drop Rendili and say go, Adam fetches Endor, like I didn&#146;t see that one coming from a mile away with Strike Planning out. :) Which happened to be the only system I probed and that was his Hidden Base. WOOHOO!!! me. :) So we start setting up I get Vader, Ozzel, Janus, Sim and TDF out at varius sites that were down he gives me Luke and I start going from there I never got to battle him on the ground, but I realize now that I should have gone to the Chambers and started dueling there and then I would have done some more damage to him. As we go through the game I get to look through Adams deck and see that he&#146;s packing Punch It&#146;s, Out Of Nowheres and I&#146;m guessing Order To Engage and me like a food discarded Point Man. I couldn&#146;t draw a Sniper for the entire game or get any real force activation the entire game which is weird for me to not get. So I finally go space with the Executor, ZiMH and Admiral Motti and move to Endor, he moves his fleet over and I know the inevitable is going to happen so I prepare for it and battle...needless to say he had more power than I did and I lost Motti and Executor and the ZiMH made a run for Raltiir, HUGE MISTAKE...he drops a couple of ships and moves some over after dropping down OTE so like a fool I initiate and he reacts and that&#146;s game.<br>
<br>
FL: -21<br>
<br>
HIGH: Playing and seeing Adam again. He&#146;s a good player<br>
LOWS: Playing Adam, one day I will beat you. :)<br>
<br>
GAME 2: Light vs John Igoe&#146;s BHBM <br>
Unfortunately I don&#146;t remember alot of this game the first turn he couldn&#146;t do anything because he drew the Emperor into his hand and didn&#146;t have the force to play him since he only had the &quot;The Emperor&quot; not &quot;Emperor Palpatine&quot; so my first turn I drain him for 1, drop Goo Nee Tay, and that seals the game for him since everything he has is HIGH deploy and he can&#146;t amass much of a comeback. The one thing that I do remember was that he came down with Lord Vader against a lone General Solo at the Bunker and initiated a battle I reacted by playing I Know and getting Daughter Of Skywalker and her Gun and deployed them for free. (excellent he fell into the trap) He had no actions other than drawing desting so I figured that I would try to shot and hit him since I run 5 or 6 6&#146;s I had a good chance and well low and behold the comeback started and I drew a 6 thus killing Vader and ending the battle and stacking one. He did get some more people down and I just beat them all off Endor, and finally took Blount, Obi-Wan With Lightsaber and Orrimaarko to the Emperor and sliced him up and won the game from there.<br>
<br>
FW: +32<br>
<br>
HIGH: Getting intot the Positives after loosing to Adam<br>
LOWS: Beating someone still new. However, I did help him with his deck so that was cool.<br>
<br>
GAME 3: Dark vs Eric Guerrero&#146;s Bothawui Op&#146;s deck<br>
Unfortunately another blur of a game. I went first and dropped the Emperor to my own Generic Docking Bay that I put on his planet and before I started he asked if I even had that in my deck and I said that you will have to see now won&#146;t you. Well he found out. So sitting at the Docking Bay, the Emperor and Trooper Davin Delth sat there the entire game along with Janus an Sim for some more Force draining...A couple of turns into the game he drops General Calrissian and a Bothawui Operative to the forest, so I responded with Lord Vader, Lightsaber and General Tagge... YES GENERAL TAGGE!!!... and beat down Gen. Cal and the Op since his Obj wasn&#146;t flipped he couldn&#146;t apply the Op<br>
s ability for drawing and I drew a 6 to get rid of them both and stack one. A few turns later after loosing 6 force for not deploying Luke he finally does to the Desert along with some other scrub and Bouush so I left them their the entire game and let him spend three to FD for 1 since everytime he went to Space I deployed and took him out of space. Throught the game tho he was trying to use &quot;pity&quot; as a vice to win. Saying things like oh, you like beating 4th graders, or beating on little kids to make you feel better. Finally I responded with, No, I like to beat players that teach me something that way I learn, if not then beating players that at least are willing to try. After that he apologized and we went our ways.<br>
<br>
FW: +39<br>
<br>
HIGH: Nothing really<br>
LOWS: The kid trying to pity win the game after I had allready won.<br>
<br>
GAME 4: Light vs Zach Shipko, NON-Objective, Death Star Start Tie deck<br>
Well I was a little worried at the start and then a little more about the ties, but Zach didn&#146;t start with any Interrupts/Effects to get things going for him and he WAY over committed to space about half way through the game where I was so far ahead I told him that I didn&#146;t have any space in my deck and that you should start loosing ships...he had 1 system out and was Force Draining me at Kessel for 1 the entire game I let that be as near the end I had Obi-Wan With Lightsaber @ Cloud City: Docking Pad with Off The Edges going and getting back all 8 force that I lost since he forgot to do a lot of force draining against me. As well I told him that he needed to use and Objective and try these and we worked his deck out as well. However, even tho I won my last three against younger players I still enjoyed myself and I got to play another person with my new Hunt Down for Light Side with You&#146;ll Find That I Am Full Of Surprise. <br>
<br>
FW: +38<br>
<br>
HIGH: Nothing really<br>
LOWS: Nothign really<br>
<br>
So the end of the tournament draw near, everyone is watching the last game. I get some Tatooine cards ready to hand out and we all get a pack of R2 and a random pack to John since his Command Card was drawn. Alex, a new person that I met pulled Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight FOIL and he was hesitant of coming to play. Glad that you did and then he wanted to play against my deck Tatooine deck and so we did...<br>
<br>
Alex (didn&#146;t get last name) BHBM vs QMC/Hunt Down<br>
<br>
This was a really fun game and a good test for my deck since I haven&#146;t had the chance to play against a BHBM deck. His first turn was activated and drew a few. I activated, deployed Bespin Cloud City, and a site 2/1 force activation for me. He went and held I went and dropped Qui-Gon, his lightsaber and Traffic Control. He went and dropped Emperor Palpatine, Lord Vader and IG-88 With Riot Gun at an adjacent site. I go and drop a character in front of them, another at another site and a Cpt. Han In The Falcon for the flip. Then converge Twass Khaa (the character in front of them) to Qui-Gon and then say go. He drops ZiMH to Han, but no damage is dealt and he actually looses 1 cause my power was higher. I drop Melas to the Falcon and forget Luke AGAIN (that&#146;s twice I did that) and beat out ZiMH but he deploys a back up and someone else and get&#146;s rid of the Falcon&#146;s crew leaving me Qui-Gon, Twass Khaa and now Luke at the adjacent site. He moves Lord VAder over and IG-88 and I start he disarms Qui-Gon, but I still battle and win one. He battles me and I still won cause of destiny. Back and forth this happens I retrieve he retireves and finally it all comes down to the last few moments. He moves Lord Vader over, I initate You&#146;ll Find I Am Full Of Surprises and another helper card (the one that add&#146;s the top destiny to power...gee a 6) well that with Luke and Lightsaber =&#146;s 16 +5 for Destiny =&#146;s 21 and he had 9 + 4 = Vader going out of the game the next turn I force drain for 7 (after getting rid of the Emperor and getting out Pucimir Thryss and Lando). So I win by 5. Close, and a good challange.<br>
<br>
