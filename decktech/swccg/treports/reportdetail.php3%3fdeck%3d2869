<br>
Ok so if you want to skip all the pretournament stuff like playtesting the ride there and all that the warm up and DPC are both marked by ************nameoftournament****************<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One day early July I was checking out the rumors boards and saw someone mention DPC Montreal and I was thinking no way that cant be true that&amp;#8217;s way too good to be true check the front page see nothing and go on with my day not thinking of it again. Atleast until maybe like 2 weeks later where I log on check out decktech and see DPC Montreal and I think DUDE SWEET then I see the date August 18th no way not cool I was planning to go to Toronto that week to go do some stuff watch Anna Kournikova play tennis stuff like that. So I have a conflict which essentially comes down to Anna K or DPC Montreal I aim Dave Monterio and a couple other people they say go to Montreal next day talk to some unbiased people who don&amp;#8217;t play SWCCG they say you saw her play last year go do this (although they thought it was just spending time in Montreal with people not a card tournament not going to ruin my rep) so Its decided DPC Montreal it is.<br>
<br>
Few days later Coruscant  spoiler list leaks out I print it out look it over see what I think is good and what is trash, then I realize that I still have a few weeks of pre Coruscant enviroment so yeah I focus on that. I let the rest of the local players know about the whole deal by e-mail hoping to get a ride&amp;#8230; no takers So next tournament I ask a few people and they are like for a chance for $1000 american *&amp;^% yeah. So we&amp;#8217;ve got two cars going down now all I needed was to sell the idea of me going to Montreal for a couple days to my parents. Go to them say yeah I&amp;#8217;m going to Montreal  on the 17th is that alright they are sure fine how much money are you going to need (I&amp;#8217;m thinking whoa they are going to pay for this ) I say I&amp;#8217;m not sure they say will $200 be enough and I respond I think that&amp;#8217;ll just be fine ($100 more than I think I really needed but hey it&amp;#8217;s free money)<br>
<br>
We had a small non sanctioned tournament where only the good players came (good being a relative term in this case) we talk tons of Coruscant tech.. what&amp;#8217;s crap what&amp;#8217;s not and set up some playtesting n stuff.<br>
<br>
The week of Coruscants release well I didn&amp;#8217;t bother going to pick up any until the weekend cause that week was filled with spending time with this girl tennis and movies (American Pie 2 was hilarious so was Rush Hour 2) where I tried to get as many people there as I could for my own playtesting reasons only got 5 other people there but the trading and games all proved insightful. But I got hosed when it came to my pulls in packs yay more qui gons.<br>
<br>
I get home from the little playtesting session I had using my pre coruscant decks against coruscant ones, if Brangus wasn&amp;#8217;t going to be so teched against in Montreal I&amp;#8217;d still play it cause it beat everyone it was played against as it should. I find out some news which is quite good cause I wouldn&amp;#8217;t miss anything cause Anna Kournikova pulled out of the tournament in Toronto so it&amp;#8217;s all good no regrets.<br>
<br>
So I put together a My Lord Is That Legal Deck first in three different ways one the Maul&amp;#8217;s Hut Start another the Blockade Bridge/Podracing and finally Theed Throne Room start. All three went through some major tweaking but in the end of those three decks I chose the Theed Throne Room start deck because the Naboo Occupation damage you dish out it Baskol is great.<br>
<br>
For light I had no idea I tried a few things ANSB Podracing (no EBO just using the Echo sites as a platform for activation, WYS and HB In the end I didn&amp;#8217;t like any of these so I went on the net checked out Alex Tennet&amp;#8217;s deck he used to win the Sweden Open messaged him and asked him how I should change it to work with Coruscant and for a few more ideas to work with my MLITL deck so I decide to try Podprofit.<br>
<br>
So I put both decks together and play them off against each other. They were both pretty balanced against each other but I continued to tweak. While I was on the net Sunday night I had a flash of insight and I wrote up two MLITL decks up on paper and decided to put them together the next day.<br>
<br>
Monday comes along and my buddy Mike Smyth phones up asks if I want to playtest today Im like sure and yo Ive gotta borrow some cards offa you my coruscant pulls were crap so he&amp;#8217;s fine with that and I head over to his place. I get the cards I need for the MLITL deck I&amp;#8217;m testing and we play a few games. He&amp;#8217;s playing the new hyperdrive objective so first game I shut him down the Arica and Keder and he realizes he has no anti spy stuff in his deck so we give it another go. I school him 3 more times until Simon our other playtest partner comes by picks us up to go over to his place. So I play Simon&amp;#8217;s deck which is essentially the same as Mike&amp;#8217;s I shut it down with the spies so we start over and he puts in anti spy stuff and we play again. I play this next game more aggressive against his sites but in the end it costs me my hold of my naboo sites and the deck took it&amp;#8217;s first loss. So I left in disgrace to go play some tennis, where I patched any dents I got from losing to a damn hyperdrive deck.<br>
<br>
Tuesday more playtesting goes on both of my decks go undefeated against both of them although they still don&amp;#8217;t see that the hyperdrive objective sucks. And my podprofit owns their senate decks.<br>
<br>
Wednesday I just chilled with some friends and put cards at the back of my mind. Thursday came along though and crunch time is at hand. I tweak my decks some more and get them to what I see is as good as I can get them without seeing how  things are being played in Montreal so. Well we playtest some more I come up on top again. Im still worrying about my light deck because well it only uses one ship and I figure I&amp;#8217;ll be seeing a lot of space decks with the senate deck and just stuff like ISB space so I begin to question my choice in light deck because of this but I&amp;#8217;m tired and I need to get up early to get stuff ready to go so.<br>
<br>
Friday comes along I get up at 9 get ready pack some clothes and some essentials for the trip. I head over to the mall to pick up a cell phone card cause Im on pay as you go and Ive been talking too much lately on my phone so it needed a refill for Montreal, I debate getting the American Pie 2 soundtrack but I cant find it so that solved that problem. I head over to Simon&amp;#8217;s house and find out we&amp;#8217;ve got two more people coming along just for the trip to Montreal, but I get to ride shotgun cause I need the leg room and well as I&amp;#8217;ll explain shortly them and Mike will be in no condition to help figure out how to get to where we&amp;#8217;re going. So load up the car and head over to Mike&amp;#8217;s place. We go in for a while and Andy, Jordan and Mike decide to smoke up to make the trip to Montreal easier on them (it made it a bit more entertaining for me) So waiting for them to finish their weed Simon and I go at it with Tony Hawk 2 I get schooled cause he was using those stupid Spidey tricks with Spiderman that&amp;#8217;s soo cheating. By the time we&amp;#8217;re done everyone&amp;#8217;s all ready to go so we head out to the car and we see two squadcars and a few cops out front.. but Mike lives like in the ghetto of Ottawa so it&amp;#8217;s nothing unusual. Andy and Jordan start playing the Penis game but they kinda made it into the Roadtrip game so them yelling ROADTRIP occupied them for a couple of minutes until we popped in a trance cd to trip them out. We head down the highway at about 150 (kph) for the most part until we start hitting all this damn construction right before Quebec so for 23k we&amp;#8217;re stuck going 80 with this dumbass tailing us for some reason between construction sites. So anyway we go through a few more cds until we get the Limp Bizkit so Andy and Jordan start singing My generation  then for some reason we all get caught up in it, it&amp;#8217;s probably the whole ROADTRIP!! thing starting to get on us we belt out a few more songs then we make it into Laval and Simon pulls into this trashy looking Motel which I have dubbed &amp;#8220;Le Ghetto Francais&amp;#8221; right on the outskirts of the city cause this one is close the the liqour store but we find out the Metro is a 50 minute walk away so Jordan and Andy have no way of getting downtown n stuff while we&amp;#8217;re playing in tournaments. We drive across the street  so Jordan and Andy can pick up drinks for the night. Then we head over to the Depaneaur (I think how it&amp;#8217;s spelt) to pick up some beer, man in Quebec it seems they sell to even 12 yearolds without question I swear to god we saw this kid buying some vodka at the liqour store.. why the rest of Canada isn&amp;#8217;t like this or just Ontario. So we drive around Laval but end up just back where we started but across the street at what I&amp;#8217;ve dubbed the &amp;#8220;classy looking Ghetto Francais&amp;#8221; and it&amp;#8217;s full but they tell us where to find a real hotel so we&amp;#8217;re off again. After about an hour driving in the same area we finally find the hotels which were in plain sight the whole time but we didn&amp;#8217;t manage to see them. So we get our rooms drop off the stuff we brought besides cards and head off to this store Cosmos where the Warm Up is being held, only a few people are there and Max &amp;#8220;Burnt Toast&amp;#8221; says we&amp;#8217;re going to start at 6. So I go buy about 10 packs of Coruscant hoping to get some stuff I need well I did so it was all good.<br>
<br>

<br>
**************************************WARM UP******************************************<br>
<br>
Game 1 My Naboo Occ Senate vs Mike Smyth&amp;#8217;s Hyperdrive deck<br>
I get Lott Dod and Orn out first turn for the flip, and he gets a whole bunch of people spread out over tatooine quite early as well. I respond with Keeder and Arica to two of those sites to stop drains and Palpy/Janus and Nute set up at the throne room with Baskol giving occ damage as well. He pops Keeder with Revealed and drains me at Watto&amp;#8217;s Junkyard for the final time to flip his jank objective, I&amp;#8217;m messing with him at his sites as well sending small beatdown squads to take out a few people things wear down I make a dumb mistake but I end up coming out of  it winning by 10<br>
<br>
2 (+10)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game2 my Podprofit vs Mike Smyth&amp;#8217;s Senate deck<br>
<br>
So I got hosed and had to play Mike again instead of one of the locals but I&amp;#8217;m fine with it cause I own him. So I get my standard start of Goo plus all the pod stuff I get two twix sites in my starting hand Lando w/ axe EPP obi and Luke + gift and I start off the podrace with a 5/6 so I was off to a good start he deploys 2 battle droids one with that destiny 6 blaster on it to his naboo db so I go and I show him who&amp;#8217;s boss with my three EPPs exclude one and school him in that battle. He manages to start working his way back but I end up finishing him off and winning by 17<br>
4(+27)<br>
<br>
Game 3 My Naboo occ Senate vs Raphael Asselin&amp;#8217;a TIGH/Bargawin/Yoxgit tech deck<br>
 It was bound to happen I suppose he cleaned up with whoever he played and me owning Mike musta got me second at this point so. I get off to a slow start I set up the senate drop the naboo sites let him go. He drops bargawin and yoxgit to home 1 dockingbay and some guys to my battle plains I think I&amp;#8217;m so smart going and fighting this little group of people but I didn&amp;#8217;t know he&amp;#8217;s be drawing crazy amount of 7s for destinies so I got smoked there. And every drain would be retrieved cause of Yoxgit/bargawin and nothing I could do about it. So he ended up schooling me by<br>
33<br>
4(-6)<br>
<br>
During my game with Raph, Brian and Chris Twig showed along with Mike &amp;#8220;Deck&amp;#8221; Gemme and a few others they just came to chill and stuff for a while I guess they played a couple pickup games<br>
<br>
Game 4 My Podprofit vs some Montreal player&amp;#8217;s Huntdown podracing with no podracing helpers cept Watto&amp;#8217;s box<br>
I dunno this guy seemed pretty annoyed at the whole situation, he musta been losing bad that day or something,. To make it short like the game I&amp;#8217;ll put it this way we had a 22 force swing in my favour I retrieved with Profit+ I did it and I took over the Executor sites and held Tatooine and won by 35<br>
<br>
6(+29)<br>
<br>
So I ended up coming third in the warmup with Raph coming in first and some guy who&amp;#8217;s name I never found out coming in second.<br>
<br>
I watch Chris Twigg and Dom play a game then Gemme and Brian play some hear the story how the new grabber is going to be called Snatch and not Grabbo as Hayes Hunter suggested to Brian then the store is  treated to some of Brian&amp;#8217;s singing of Minority and Flavor of the Week, Chris is right&amp;#8230; he really shouldn&amp;#8217;t sing&amp;#8230;jk man it&amp;#8217;s cool<br>
<br>
Simon and Mike go over to Burger King to get some food after my game I head over to grab some fries and a drink, so I buy them  bring em back to the store so I could get some stuff done. The Twiggs and Gemme needed some funny money&amp;#8230;errr Canadian Money so I exchange Twigg some Canadian for some American so they can go get food.  <br>
<br>
<br>
They head off and Mike and Simon get back and say we&amp;#8217;re gonna go back to the hotel. I finish off the fries and drink but I begin to feel a headache and sick to my stomach and I&amp;#8217;m like WTF? How the hell am I getting sick from this? I try toughing it out in my hotel room but it eventually gets to the point where I&amp;#8217;m puking up like everything I ate in the like last month @#$% and I musta like cut my throat from pukin so much cause yeah well you get the point. So they go off to Simon Andy and Jordan&amp;#8217;s room to go watch Shrek (I still don&amp;#8217;t get why Hotels get movies that are still in theatres) I think I finally musta got some sleep then around 1 Jordan and Andy come in the room and well they&amp;#8217;re like yo he&amp;#8217;s passed out I get up start talking to em Jordan&amp;#8217;s like yo Tom guess what we rode back from the strip club in.. I don&amp;#8217;t feel like going on a guessing game thing in my condition so I&amp;#8217;m just like what? And he&amp;#8217;s like Lincoln Continental man.. Limo man we got a flat rate of $50..  Andy starts askin what&amp;#8217;s up with me and I explain about the poison burger king food and he&amp;#8217;s like yo have some Rum man it&amp;#8217;ll cure all I decline. Mike comes back and he builds completely new decks cause I think he came like last in the warm up so he build a profit and a Huntdown deck with 9 tramples n walkers n stuff. We try goin lights out and trying to get some rest but yeah we couldn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep. So he asks if I&amp;#8217;m feeling well enough to playtest his decks, I&amp;#8217;m like whatever, I change my dark cause getting beat by Raphael that bad showed me I had some big holes in that deck (like I didn&amp;#8217;t put in my second Lott Dod in or We must accelerate + Bridge ect) So we playtest and order shrek to watch while we&amp;#8217;re doing it man that movie is hilarious the muffin man interrogation scene was worth the price we paid for it. So it&amp;#8217;s about 5 when the movie is over and we get to bed it&amp;#8217;s about 5:30 when I get to sleep then I&amp;#8217;m up again at 7:30 wow tons of sleep. I try getting another half hour of sleep before the wake up call and I don&amp;#8217;t. Do the usual morning stuff grab a bite to eat in the hotel restaurant and wake up Jordan and Andy in the meanest possible way you could when someone is hungover well that and Mike actually pulled them both outta bed .  What a dumbass if that was me I woulda killed him&amp;#8230; so anyway<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************DPC REPORT*******************************************<br>
<br>
The Quest to find the DPC<br>
 <br>
We check out of the Hotel and head into Montreal thinking we know where we&amp;#8217;re going. So we park a couple blocks away from where we have it marked on our map as to where it is and we were so wrong. We walk around St Joseph and around Montreal they phone up people and ask people on the street for directions to where this place is and well we were told to go the opposite of whatever the last person told us so we were getting nowhere. It was 10 to 11 and well we shoulda been there by now so I decide to take charge and solve this problem. I phone about 6 friends until I find one who&amp;#8217;s acutally at home or awake to get on their comp and just find out the address for the place for us (cause someone left it in the car thinking we were right by the place) and well we ended up right in front of it by the time we got the address. I give madprops to my man KC for giving me the addy and doing me a big favour.<br>
<br>
So we walk in about half an hour late for the DPC we tell our sad tale about how we were lost and jank. Max tells us there&amp;#8217;s someone with a bye and two of us can play each other. The person with the bye is Chris Twigg.. and guess who get&amp;#8217;s picked by Max to play against him.. lucky me I get to play someone good first game.<br>
<br>
Game 1 My DS Naboo Occ Senate Deck Vs Chris&amp;#8217; Slave Quarters Start<br>
I had two problems here.. I just got here I&amp;#8217;m tired from walking around town looking for the damn place and I get to play Chris first lucky me. I manage a half decent start getting the blockade bridge pretty early and Lott Dod set up in the senate. He deployed a few Twix sites as well as some Tatooine sites to drain at. At those sites EPP Han and Leia as well as Jedi Luke w/ his stick and a Obi&#146;s journal. I think I can take this little group with EPP Vader, 4lom and a senator for forefit boy was I wrong, I forgot to get the Max 1 destiny senator down first so i got killed by a don&#146;t get @#$%y cause he drew 5 destinies (I cancelled Leia&#146;s text) So this battle a loss in an important SAC war and my not being able to draw my UC spies killed me and Chris won by 29<br>
<br>
FL 0(-29)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well we found the place and I got to play a big name player<br>
Lows: Not having Edcel Bar Gone down for that battle<br>
<br>
Another local player Martin Prud&#146;homme who drove up in the morning, came over told me how he had to play Raphael first game and he got schooled by the same deck that Raph schooled me with the night before and we talk about the deck and both of our decks while I filled out my decklists<br>
Game 2<br>

My PodProfit vs Some guy who got schooled by Clint first game and his Senate Space deck Coruscant system start<br>
Well after learning why they call Chris the Massa, I was given a nice easy game to rebuild my confidence. I get a hand which gives me exactly what i need to win the game quickly. Two Twix Sites Qui Gon and his stick EPP Luke EPP Ben ASB and a Tunnel Vision.. it&#146;s sweet. My Podracer goes unchallenged so I&#146;ll get the force swing. he pulls Executor docking bay and Imp Commands for Thrawn (he said after the game that Adm Piett was there so.. I find it wierd he did that) deploys him and Chirineau there. I win the podrace soon afterwards retrieving my tunnel visions and the couple of cards i lost to drains from the senate. I deploy all my characters to the Tatooine sites besides the AC and i wait to rescue Han while i look for more things to help me out I TV and get Boushh and i drop her to the senate and deploy Qui and Lando to Tat:JP. He gets out Kashyyyk and Naboo deploys Executor and moves Thrawn and Chirineau up. The rest of the game is me retrieving with Profit and I Did it! damaging him with I hope she&#146;s alright, profit and drains. As well as a battle w/ Maul where he came down to Lando and Qui&#146;s site, I Weapon Lev&#146;d his stick slashed him and got rid of Maul. Thr rest was just drains<br>

Game 3 My DS vs Justin &quot;H20&quot; Desai&#146;s WYS<br>
<br>
I was glad to play someone who&#146;s name I recognized (mostly from Gemme&#146;s TRs and Justin&#146;s stuff on DT). So anyway I get what would be a god hand against WYS if the maul I got was Tatooine instead of coruscant, I had Maul his stick his ship Mara and her stick plus Lott Dod and Edcel. So I put down Lott and Edcel to flip the objective, I grab a political effect, draw up get a We must accelerate... and let him go. He deployed Mirax and the skate to the spaceport db he pulled and moved them up and he let me go. I used Lott Dodd to grab POTF, drained him for 1 used We must accelerate.. to get the Bridge, wished I had enough force to deploy and battle mirax with Maul and his ship..but i&#146;m 1 short, so I draw up some more get Janus and Palpy. He deploys Dash and outrider next turn as well as kessel mirax moves to kessel and dash goes up to tatooine. I grab Haako with Lott drain him for 2 at the senate and drop Palpy Janus and Haako to the Throne Room draw up a couple til i get someone to cancel the kessel drain and let him go. He drains at Tatooine i cancel the kessel drain w/ my political effect he deploys Jedi Luke w/ his stick and Theron Nett the db and cantina respectively. An obvious RLR trap. And me thinking hey i can sense it (not until i battled did I remember that WYS canceled sense 2 hours of sleep and being sick all night will do that to you) So Maul and mara come down but RLR brings Luke over he Too closes one of my swings and i draw the Battle plains i haven&#146;t got yet with Nemoidian Advisor and a 4 for weapon destiny with mara maul gets sliced he draws a 6 for destiny so they are both gone I killed Theron though. I get Maul back with No Escape and get Vader from my deck deploy em both Vader gets barriered maul dies again. Rest of the game is draining, him getting 5 back with On The edge and that&#146;s it really<br>

Highs: that hand at the start<br>
Lows: me not using that hand properly<br>
<br>
Talk to Gemme after find out he&#146;s in the same boat so far t 1-2 and tell him how his friend Justin was nice enough to school me. <br>
<br>
Game 4 My Ls vs Mike the guy who came up with Martin and his Senate Space<br>
I&#146;m playing besides Gemme and his luck was @#$%ty again he was playing MWYHL and got Daughter in his starting Hand.. that sucks for him<br>
<br>
After this deck&#146;s last game i figured I&quot;m fine against space Alex was right that one ship should be fine against most space decks (course you dont&#146; actually use the ship for anything but a trackable 7). This game is a little tighter though he actually brings people down to face me on tatooine besides maul. I win the race unchallenged fairly quickly that i only get to retrieve about 3 but a 9 force swing is better than no swing. He deploys a Palpy at Coruscant DB along with Sim and Janus and Battle Plan as well as starts goin up with Dreadnaughts in stuff at two systems. I see this Sim Janus Palpy group as a big target. Lando with Axe EPP Obi and Luke come down, I battle exclude Sim slash Janus (I drew a 5/6 I shoulda went after palpy) draw a 2 he draws a 4 obi goes I resiliance him. This site eventually gets cleared on his side. And i draw up until I get to 14 in my reserve so I can pull off we&#146;re doomed. So i use that w/ threepio tracking to keep myself alive while he gets drained out and damage from profit, I track a 6 to on the edge and end up winning by 22<br>

<br>
Highs: I love threepio he&#146;s a god card<br>
Lows: still being in the hole differential wise<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
My DS with who I think was Avatar&#146;s little brother cause he was a local and said his older brother was doing well and he was english so I&#146;m just assumin.. and his WYS deck<br>
We talk before we start he tells me he just started and he went 6-0 at his last tournament.<br>
<br>
So anyway I get Squabbling in my starting hand so I go for  Lott right away deploy him and Yeb for flip search for a political effect and since i Squabbling before i activated i wasn&#146;t sure if any were they and there weren&#146;t any so he got to take a look and said something after going through around the lines of this should be easy.. I was thinking after that you&#146;re going down now @#$% so anyway i draw up get the bridge let him go. He deploys Kashyyyk and rendevous point. He masses his ships at Rendevous point.. i&#146;m thinking wha? if he is Avatar&#146;s little bro you&#146;ve gotta teach him how to play WYS dude. He&#146;s grabbing everything he tells me he&#146;s playing 3 normal and 1 of the new (he&#146;d sure be ready for brangus) I set up for drains on Naboo w/ the usual Throne room posse hold back the beatdown squads. His next turn is him spreading out with ships to Kessel Tat and Kashyyyk. His next turn he deploys Jedi Luke and Theron Nett (deja vu) to the db and cantina I deploy Mara, Vader and 4lom to the cantina battle he RLR I kill them both off but vader takes a hit and 4lom has to go cause of destiny. Luke comes down again to the db Maul and Aurra come down to that site Aurra Weapon Lev&#146;s Luke Aurra misses Maul aurra dies. So it&#146;s down to a few cards for him Batte Plan affects him now and Menace isn&#146;t in effect anymore He We&#146;re Doomed but I grab that card so fast it&#146;s not funny after what i did with it last game so I drain him some more for a while until it gets to the point where he&#146;s only draining me for 1 and I end it and win by 20 and he ends it by saying that wasn&#146;t as easy as i thought it&#146;d be<br>

<br>
Highs: MY DARK WON WOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>
Lows: Falling for RLR again why don&#146;t i just go kill luke<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
My LS vs some guy from Montreal&#146;s RalOps.. that&#146;s right RalOps<br>
<br>
He doesn&#146;t challenge my podracer I win it in two turns retrieving only  my two TVs i used and the ASB that put back my Qui Gon&#146;s stick that got drawn so i could get it in my hand w/ weapon lev. On Raltiir he sets up TS2 and 2 ATST pilots at one site Vader Tarkin at another and Palpy in the middle at a DB (which i think now shouldn&#146;t of been in the middle but who cares it made no difference to me) with establish control.. he draws up looking for something and leaves only 1 force. I see this as a chance for a beatdown Qui Gon Obi w/stick and Lando come down to school Palpy he tries to barrier Qui Gon but the Bith shuffle combo shuts it down Palpy gets slashed he loses about 12 I lose Obi and resiliance him. Luke and Obi go and rescue Han Qui Gon YABed so Lando has to fight Vader and Tarkin alone, I shoot tarkin and hit him.. he doesn&#146;t cancel i didn&#146;t say anything Lando gets slashed but he daws only a 2 for destiny and i lose 8. I&#146;m taking a drain for another turn at Vader&#146;s site and 1 from the walker site but Vader runs away before Qui Gon is back in the land of playability. A few turns it&#146;s just him losing to me and me losing 1 until Maul comes down at JP then it comes down to profit damage and his 1 drain at the walker site until 1 turn i forget to move so i lose 7... ouch but in the end i prevail and win by 7. Close to the end of this game I heard the funniest thing Brian Twigg yells out to Clint &quot;Hey Clint is Bottomly here?&quot; that was some funny @#$%<br>
<br>
FW +7<br>
<br>
8(+15)<br>
<br>
Highs: 3 Game winning streak going on<br>
Lows: I should of moved that one time but I was being distracted that turn by Simon, Mike Andy and Jordan saying they want to leave and I should lose so they can go.. so that blowed, I won though and I got a ride with Martin instead so they left and Mike and Simon dropped<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 7 My DS vs Matt Sokol&#146;s Slave Quarters start<br>
<br>
My first thought Cool I get to play Matt Sokol second thought @#$% I&#146;m playing Matt Sokol. I get off to my usual start of getting Lott Dod (this time with Squabbling) and another senator I flip and grab the +2 to drains political Effect cause the canceller was activated and POTF goes to the senate I then let him go. He gets out some Twix sets up the Cantina Shuffle as well gets out the Outskirts. I get Keeder with Lott Dodd and the drain canceller w/ the objective he&#146;s using the shocking/scrambled pulling combo with threepio going through his deck getting what he needs. He looks one turn and finds no shocking combo so I get to take a look at his deck notice no obis in there and that it&#146;s what i thought it would be a slave quarters deck with no big fancy trick that would make me have to change my game. I activate 1 use Masterful move to grab monnok, I do it lost to catch the obis I also catch 2 ICBW and 2 other cards which i forget.. nice. I finish activating get Keeder with Lott. His turn he deploys  Luke,EPP Leia and Han to the outskirts .Keeder comes down my turn. My next turn EPP Vader 4-lom and Iggy come down to party there I capture Han cancel leias text 4 lom get&#146;s slashed i miss luke all that&#146;s left at the site is Iggy and Luke. Leia comes down his turn I dropped Mara battled and Iggy sent Leia to the used pile slahsed Luke w/mara but both Mara and Iggy died. His turn Luke and Leia come back down and the tense part of the game begins. Keeder is still at the Slave Quarters Palpy and P-59 come down there. And the rest of the game is him chasing me on tatooine, me draining at the senate, him pulling off the shuffle but the cantina drain getting cancelled w/ senators. We do this until I&quot;m down to four cards and Matt is down to 3 he draws up and says good game. Well that was one tense game because it was so close in the last 15 minutes of play one mistake or good draw could cause the game to go either way, and it went mine.<br>
<br>
FW + 4<br>
<br>
10 (+19)<br>
<br>
Highs Beating Matt Sokol.. he&#146;s world champion it&#146;s a high I don&#146;t care what anyone says<br>
Lows: nothing really Matt is a good guy i didn&#146;t really make any mistake other than not move Keeder once or twice this was just really close.<br>
<br>
Talk to Gemme again he&#146;s not doing great, Justin is going around trying to find how how everyone who&#146;s 5-2 and higher is doing to see who he&#146;s playing but me and my terrible differential is too low for his like + 70 or something. Pairings come up, I&#146;m really hoping that i don&#146;t get to the top table cause I know I&#146;m too far back to make the final 4 so I&quot;m hoping that my diff will be enough to have me playing someone who&#146;s not so great.. gets to the first game at the second table Chris Terwilliger and Thomas Dowling...damn so much for that <br>
<br>
So it seems It begins with Twigg and ends with Twigg. that woulda made a good title<br>
<br>
Game 8 My LS vs Chris&#146;s Huntdown<br>
Pairing is announced Chris is like where&#146;s Tom and then heyyy man so we start and finish together that&#146;s cool ect ect. He asks me how I&#146;ve been doing I tell him my dark has split and my light is undefeated, Brian is playing right beside us and he&#146;s like whoa you&#146;re playing profit how&#146;d you go undefeated with that I say I didn&#146;t play anyone good with it (which is true) He gets kinda defensive and apoligetic for some reason sayin I didn&#146;t mean it as an insult which I knew but hey it&#146;s all cool I know it was said in surprise no offense taken <br>
<br>
So chris starts Mara and Evezan/PB combo at my AC (first person to do it all day) I get Qui and his stick in my hand but what may of been the biggest mistake I made all day I didn&#146;t deploy him on my turn to JP where he moved to challenge him worrying about Evezan operating and leaving like Lando alone with the two of them (i had ECC lando in my hand this time not Lando w/axe). Maul Vader and Palpy follow in the next few turns. I win the podrace but can&#146;t retrieve cause of SP and me not having the force to pay. He drained me heavy there until I came down to the AC to rescue Han and he then split up. I was cancelling Visages left and right with OOC/TT until finally I run out and another comes down so Corran and Lando need to make a visit to the Executor, and for the first time in the tournament against me someone loses the 2 force instead of ditching their force cause of I did it and with good reason, he counter assaults me on the executor I end up losing 6 to that. My people get beat off tatooine and I succumb quickly to heavy drains and I lose by 20<br>
<br>
FL -20<br>
<br>
10 (-9)<br>
<br>
Highs: I could finally go take a piss i had to go since like halfway though the game but i wanted to play it through cause if i had to go i should of went before<br>
Lows: losing and finishing in the negatives<br>
<br>
So that&#146;s it find out Gemme had a bye cause 6 DS players dropped so that sucked for him.<br>
<br>
I watched the game at the spotlight table (whatever they call it) and back and forth to Sokol&#146;s game against Foss whenever Sokol started yelling something that i found interesting.. <br>
<br>
My ride is leaving I say later to a few of the ppl i met tell Gemme I&#146;ll see him at Dcon (after this weekend there&#146;s no way I&quot;m not going a whole weekend like that would be amazing) so I don&#146;t stick around for the finals or even find out my placing but there were alot of people who went 5-3 and well with -9 i was most likely at the end of them so maybe 17th or something<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s the top 7 thanks to Justin Desai<br>
<br>
1)Yannick Lapointe<br>
2)Johnny Chu <br>

6)Martin Pauquet <br>
7)Chris twigg (5-3 players started here I think)<br>
<br>
<br>
So I check out my cell phone notice I&quot;m getting no signal in this place I walk out and it tells me i have like 9<br>
voice messages but 4 of them were are garbled so i have no clue what was up with that. We take about half an hour to get out of montreal cause the city is a maze with a million damn one ways and I get back home at 10:30<br>
