<br>
Its Wendsday afternoon, I am Dogystyling with my girlfriend. My phone ring... I am pissed. I answer, Its Jo... That guy almost never call me... unless he is in need of sex (joke). So I am like what do he want. He ask me if I am ready ??? so I am like FOR WHAT ! Well he tell me we are going to Origin in 2 hours ! Wohoo, I thaught I would miss that tournement. So I get my @#$% ready, and we are going..... In a 30 years old car... When I saw It... I was like, there is no way that piece of cr*p is gunna take us to Origins. <br>
<br>
The Quebec team is Me, Joe Joe Binks, Crusher, and Burntoast. My mother and my sister had bought me a box of bronies... But yannick told me he had read a article by Clint telling how to use brownie, and I must order it at dennys to have its full power. So I am screwed :( <br>
<br>
Anyways, we need to go to Toronto before, because we know a guy there that have a uncle that has a hotel near Origin , so its only gunna cost us 25 $. So we go there, and we sleep there.... everybody got a coutch..... except for me.... I am the youngest, so they make me sleep on the floor ! FUC*ER !!!!!! But haha the floor is confortable, so I sleep like a baby :) <br>
<br>
So we head for origin.... We stop at a Gas Station to eat.... there was a subway in it.... Unfortunatly for me , the Submarine we took taste like gas.... So after 14 hours of driving (and listening to some bad music... like South park music, at least there was a song by Rancid on it) we are finally In Ohio. But it seams like the guy that had told us his uncle had a hotel had mistaken... He only have a haunt.... and her hotel in in another country.... anyways.... So we go to the convention.... but there is no place to park, so we ask the girl where is the other parking.... we speak french, and she talk fast, so I have no clue of what she said... so we go where she think she told us to go... there is a parking... cool. So we wait in line to register... We were so well placed.... just behind of me , there was a girl with FF breast !!!! and in front of me, there was a girl in J string !!!! Do I need to mention I was in erection ??? So we register. <br>
<br>
I am to poor to make the thursday SWCCG sealed deck, so I go play Magic.... I get wreck so bad... I went 0-2 drop. Then I see someone 6'4'' pointing his finger at me, and asking Clint Hays something.... So I am like hmmm  Fu*k did I say something very bad to Clint Hays, and he pay this guys to beat me up :) But its Gabe Alonso, and he just wanna say hi. That guy is really cool, and a great player. I also saw Cummie Boy, so I chalenge his stuffed animal in a fight... My Max Rebo was Fighting his little cat... the fight was close, but max Rebo's Bu*t attack fini the poor cat fast. In fact, I completely wreck him... He was really desperated after that ( its probably because of that he scrub out...) ... Well dont worry Charlie, you will have your rematch 1 day. <br>
<br>
My 3 Quebecers friends tell me they wanna keep their deck secret for the open saturday, so I have to find team member for friday. So Yannick introduce me to Gary Carman, and I ask him If I wanna be his teammate. He said thats cool. I am happy, we will win for sure. Its late, so we head back for the hotel. So we go take our car... The guy tell us its 26 $ !!! We tell him, the lady had told us it was 5$ per day... So he is like... thats not the Convention parking, its a private parking... The convention parking is just on the other side of the road !!!! FU*K!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>
<br>
We go to the hotel... and I have to sleep with the &quot;hairy&quot; Burntoast.... My nightname....  I cant sleep all night because I fear his body hair will attack me. So the next morning, I try to put my contact lents... After 10 min, I put 1... Then after 10 other min I put the other 1.... wait !!! no !!!!! I put the second one on the first contact lents... AHHHHHHHH!!!!!! I am pissed, i'll just wear my glasses. So we arrive late. I go talk to Garry, but he told me he had chose another teamate because I thaught I would not come :( So I make a team with the chicks from ontario, her boyfriend, and a random scrub. So before the tournemnt, we talk a little, and decide to chose a team name. I cant think of anything that is not releated to sex. So I tell them to chose a name. They have no clue, so I say, well we are really scrubish, so lets call ourselves the Real Scrub. So everybody think its cool, except for that random b*tch. He tell us, that he is a good player and not a scrub...lol. Anyways, I didn't bother with that... I think he was playing Hemnet beatdown for light and DarkWater lockdown for dark... Take a look at the deck I chose to use.<br>

So thats My deck. Then I took a look at the deck my Ontarien teamate were gunna use and change like 10 card in each of their deck. They look good, so we might have a chance at doing well. Now, ill talk about my match... but I had lots of work those past week, and some girlfriend problems ( at one point I had 2 GF at the SAME time, now I have 0.... but maybe 1 soon..... life is so complicated ). So I had not any time to do this tournement report before... I dont quite remeber each game perfectly, but I will do my best.<br>
<br>
So Team Open game 1:<br>
<br>
Game 1: My DS VS Steve Brentson Profit/Elom/Tessek Deck.<br>
<br>
I keep drewing crap all game, so all times I have like 30 cards in my hand, and 20 in my deck. I get a look at his deck soon, And I notice he have no starship. So I put Kashyyk, Kiffex with each 1 starship and no pilots  to drain for 4 all games. But... he had bargaining table.At one point I had endor and the executor. but he drain me bery bad on tatoine. I go fight him with some walker but he narrow escape. I try to find my monock or masturfull move before I attack him. But I am not lucky and never find them. So I dont have time to loose, because harc self in the audience chamber reduce my drain at Tatoine JP. In the audience chamber he have BB Han Solo EPP Leia and 2 ellom. I set my attack carefully. I track his destiny till he have a 2 on top. I track my shoking revelation. He have 2 force left. I drain for 2, He Harc Self of 1.... so I am thinking is he stupid or I suck a*s ? Anyways, I deploy Blast Doorr Control, Choke vader, Tarkin, I am thinking, I attack, I choke, he miss with the gun. Han is choke, so I cancel his only destiny. So I attack, I choke han. POW he is choke.... but he pay 1 and make me redraw it.... so I am like FUC*ING SHIT I SUCK CO*K. I miss, so he have 2 destiny now, and I must loose tarkin... but because I kept drawing @#$% all games, I was short on force in my reserve deck, so I have no force to move vader.... now he deploy 8 eloms, and I tell his good game . FL -14<br>
<br>
Highlights: NONE<br>
LOwlights: The crapy judge made a ruling against me. Steve thaught he could retrieve han, and pay 1 force to retrieve his only card in lost pile, because I had secret plans. but he must pay 10 ! I ask juz after... those fuc*ing fake judge suck a$$ ! AND I FUC*ING LOST !<br>
<br>
Game 2: MY LS VS a Kid Playing COTVG.<br>
<br>
Well, I drew something like mega falcon luke bacta tank and kessel in my first few turn. So each turn I drain for 3 in space, I have undercover spy and projection everywhere. He attack my falcon, I punch It. He lost 10 more. Luke retrieve with his first strike...  FW +38<br>
<br>
Highlights: EASY GAME <br>
LOWLIGHTS: I hate palying kids<br>
<br>
2 +24<br>
<br>
Game 3: MY LS VS some scrub playing dagoba drain with tie/coud car/tibanas gas miner.<br>
<br>
Before this game, Cummie Boy tell me he lost to this guy... so I am like @#$%.... I play on dagoba too. He chose to start Endor with the operative objective. I draw till I have super falcon and OTE. So We fight In space, and Luke + Orimarko + Yado at his hutt control his only BG site. At 1 point he put some laser conon on his tie, and attack the falcon. he is lucky so he have it.... but I play A few maneuver :) hehe that was game ! so OTE and some drain kill his a$$ off. FW + 33<br>
<br>
Highlights: EASY GAME<br>
Lowlights: I hate playing Scrub<br>
<br>
4 + 57<br>
<br>
Game 4: My DS VS a fuc* always asking stupid question EBO space deck.<br>
<br>
So that b!tch piss me off. he keep asking me how many force I will activate next turn and how many force I have in my hands. So at a point I am pissed, I start answering and @#$%ing him in french. So I control the BG site and Trample all his spy with my tracking skill. I always kept my stardestroy at only 1 or 2 system in fear of power pivot. I have Imperial decree working and we fight. I cant draw SHUOSHD, so he use abusively the bacta tank giving me trouble. but he was gay. FW +19<br>
<br>
Highlights: EASY GAME<br>
Lowlights: I hate playing A$$hole<br>
<br>
6 + 76<br>
<br>
Game 5: My DS VS Adam Beauchamp (I think) playing Ground EBO.<br>
<br>
His deck was like a TRM and my Dark side was made to wreck all TRM deck... because someone had told me all team albany were using them. So I use the same strategy. I control his only batle ground system. I control his only batle ground site. I put CHYBC and U3P0 at the DS docking bay. So I put all my Ship at at kashyyk and he came to fight with mantelian starvip and once he had no character lelt he was dead. FW +25<br>
<br>
8 + 101<br>
<br>
Highlights: EASY GAME<br>
Lowlights: I think he is a good player. So I have a good win at least.<br>
<br>
Game 6: MY LS VS Dan Sokol Playing ROPS<br>
<br>
Before the game, Clint Hays tell him I am good, and I am a cheater :) he is just kiding about that, but Dan think its tru and ask me to remove my cap  :) hehe I ask him to remove his first. Anyways, that made me lost my scrub look :( He was not lucky drawing 0 2/0 location until his 2nd turn. He flip on his 5 turn. He was force to deploy 4 site because of my Projection and Spy. So I Put all my character at his docking bay to stop loosing from Search and Destroy. I start to drain at Kessel for 2. I sometimes move to raltir to make the objective unflip. but he usualy flip it again. AAA is hurting me, but I retrieve with on the Edge. He attack with BOBA in Slave 1 and Bussk In buss my falcon with a track 6 and a 4. I play I know and Punch It. I draw 4,6,5,5,5. I THINK I put legendary starfighter...not sure tho... But he is covering. Then I won. FW +14<br>
<br>
10 +115<br>
<br>
Highlights: I love to play against good USA player. Its much more fun than playing scrub.<br>
Lowlights: NONE<br>
<br>
So I finish 5th. Sounds good to me. My team all scrub out :( so we finish I think 4... Well I think they all did 3-3... It was cool meeting all those players I only know from the Internet. I fell bad because gary Carmam team won.... so I lost a box of reflection :(<br>
<br>
Now this evening I want to make the CCT manipulation all my friends are using, and a Profit deck. Unfortunatly we only have 3 CCT objective and I was messing with the Big Blue deck since a while, So I give my Objective to my friend Jo. Now I want to make my profit deck, but I watch the TV and there is cool show going on... Its call Strip POker ( I never saw something like that in my hole life ! American are lucky:) ! Its a 2 Girls VS 2 Boys quiz. Each bad answer by the girls or the boy make them remove a piece of clothes... And the girls are loosing bad :) so its cool because the loosing team remove all their clothes. At the end there was a sprint of question and the girls got them all... so they won :( I WAS SO FU*KING PISSED !!!!!!! AHHHHHH I dont wanna see nude men ! I am frustrated so I dont make my profit deck. So I guess I'll play with the same deck.<br>
