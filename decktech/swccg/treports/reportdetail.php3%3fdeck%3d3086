<br>
I guess you could say it started about a week ago when Ryan asked me if I wanted to go to the last pre-R3 tourney, so I said sure.  Greyson is also coming, so we have our full team ready, Team Just Bring It.  <br>
<br>
So the week of the tourney, Ryan comes over and we test decks.  I try HB Flip and it sucks.  I then try PodProfit and I like it so I decide to keep it.  I get on AIM and talk to Mike Merletto and he told me that he has 3 EPP Mauls AND he combined them with Senate, okay crap.  He said they would own PodProfit and I knew they would. So, back to the drawing boards.  It is Thursday night, and I am talking to Greyson on the phone and while we are talking I am fumbling through my cards and I come across 2 AFA&#146;s, sweet.  So I tell him that I am going to play a mad cheese deck (you know, 100% American kind that makes you...never mind) But he doesn&#146;t have MWYHL so I decide to make a Hidden Base deck with AFA&#146;s, Racing, EPP Luke and EPP Obi, some 5&#146;s and 6&#146;s, and *drumroll* 9 OOC&#146;s (4 Combo, 5 non). YES, 9:) I figured this would annoy people off and I like doing that (right Brad):) j/k<br>
<br>
Next day is Friday and I get out of school and head towards Ryan&#146;s house to spend the night.  I get there and tell him about the deck and he just laughs.  I go searching through all his cards and find 2 AFA, that makes 4 and I need 5.  I scrounge around some more, go under the bed, check behind his shelf, and then I FINALLY find one in his closet, sweet.  My LS deck is set, now onto DS.  I build this pretty neat HD earlier in the week and borrowed some cards from John Irving and Corey Boba (Thanks guys).  Greyson lets me borrow HD and 2 Visages (Thanks man).  My decks are set so I test my LS against Greyson&#146;s DS Senate.<br>
<br>
It was a really cool game because I placed almost his entire lost pile OOP. *NOTE* I also put on my sleeves that I insert in their reserve deck LMAO because I couldn&#146;t stop laughing when I saw Greyson&#146;s face *END NOTE* You see the reason why I play 9 is to stop Brangus, ALL DS Retrieval (because their lost pile is OOP), and to annoy them (I am good at that, ask Brad:).  Anyways, I win so I am confident in my LS.  I don&#146;t test my DS because I thought it was good.  So we get some sleep, and wake up at 9:00.  Greyson&#146;s Grandparents pick us up and we are off.<br>
<br>
End of Pre-tourney<br>
<br>
We get their fairly early and wait for other people to show up.  Mike and Brad arrive and we talk a little bit.  Some others show up, but not the regulars (Henry, Fredrick, and some others) oh well.  We start about 11ish with 16-18 people.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
Brian Speight (me)- 100% American Cheese and HD Liquid (not Solid, but Liquid)<br>
<br>
Ryan Obman - HD and PodProfit<br>
<br>
Greyson Thompson - DS Senate and PodProfit<br>
<br>
Rating going in 1561<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: HD Liquid vs. Carson Swanek&#146;s (1530&#146;s) QMC Sabacc<br>
I start the same stuff the whole tourney, IAO/SP, YCHF, and Crush.  He starts KTEOF, and 2 random effects.  I play 6 Vaders, so I get one in my starting hand.  Activate 6, get a docking bay, drop DVDLOTS, Visage.  He draws up and Visage.  My turn, drain 1.  Drop a couple of guys, get Flagship Bridge and Holotable.  Deploy a docking bay, draw up and get a Tarkin.  Visage for him.  He drops a ship to Bespin, Figrin D&amp;#8217;an and Threepio somewhere else, and CC Lando to CC Casino.  Tunnel Visions, Sabacc&amp;#8217;s and he wins.  Okay, this doesn&amp;#8217;t look too good and I can&amp;#8217;t let him keep on doing this crap.  He draws some and plays OOC/TT and I cancel with This Is Some Rescue.  1 to Visage.  My turn, I activate a crapload, drop Tarkin to Vader&amp;#8217;s site, and give Vader his Saber.  Drop Janus and Palpy to DS: Docking bay.  Deploy Maul and Run Haako to CC: Casino, 1 to Visage.  His turn he Sabacc&#146;s, I lose because he got perfect.  I call over Brad, the TR, and ask him if he can Sabacc even if Tat. Maul is there, and he says he can but can&amp;#8217;t retrieve....okay, weird.  Drain of 1 at Bespin, does Figrin D&amp;#8217;an crap and wins.  Tunnel Visions, Sabbac again and we tie.  1 to Visage.  My turn, activate a lot drain for 6 total and this is the way the whole game went.  <br>
<br>
FW + 15<br>
<br>
2(+15)<br>
<br>
In that game Brad was talking about some Rap songs and I reminded him about the NC Rap song.  He starts to sing it and it is hilarious.  I bust out laughing when he says &amp;#8220;c&amp;#8217;mon now take your shirt off and swing it like a helicopter...North Carolina c&amp;#8217;mon now raise up...etc.&amp;#8221;  I guess you had to be there, it was just funny:)<br>
<br>
Game 2: 100% American Cheese vs. Will Wright&amp;#8217;s (1317) CCT Racing<br>
I start DODN/WA for free grabbers (grab Projective Telepathy so they can&amp;#8217;t keep canceling AFA, tech)  He flashes, gets a 7 and draws up.  My turn, activate 5.   OOC,  insert AFA, get a System and draw some.  He activates and draws high, now he has 15 to my 9...crap.  He drops Mara w/Stick to AC and  AFA pops, so he loses 4 and I place 2 of them OOP.   My turn, drop EPP Luke against Mara.  Drop Battle Plan, battle for free.  Cut her and draw high while he misses the cut and draws low.  I resilence, and he loses Mara and 4 and I draw some.  I get 2 AFA&amp;#8217;s but no A Step Backwards...crap and I say go.  He activates, race and he has 23 to my 17...must not lose race.  He drops some scrub at Tat. Marketplace, and then he wants to Elis a captive.  I say no and we call over Brad and he says he can&amp;#8217;t.  So he just draws up.  I drop EPP Obi  in AC to kill that scrub and drop EPP Luke at Marketplace.  Battle for free, cut him and he loses him and 5.  Battle in AC against Jodo Kast, cut him and draw a 6.  So Jodo and 8.  His turn he wins the race and I lose 6, but he can&amp;#8217;t retrieve 6 because his whole lost pile is OOP, hahaha.  I insert AFA 3 more times and he just draws up.<br>
<br>
FW +30<br>
<br>
4(+45)<br>
<br>
I am like 4th and Ryan is in first I think.  He wins by a insane amount and we go to Wendy&amp;#8217;s.  Wendy&amp;#8217;s is awesome and I get some Nuggets and Fries.  The only bad thing was their weren&amp;#8217;t any good looking girls this time:(  We eat and talk about R3 and what to play and then head back for game 3. <br>
<br>
Game 3: 100% American Cheese vs. John Irving&amp;#8217;s (1639) HD SOLID<br>
Well, before the tourney started John let me look through his DS and how SOLID it was, and it was.  He played Duel/Beatdown but no Projective Telepathy&amp;#8217;s, haha.  So we start and I show him I am racing and he gets out his starting effects.  We race and I draw high.  He uses IAO and Crush to get a Docking Bay and I Have You Now.  I cancel Visage and it is my turn.  I get out a system, and draw some.  I get EPP Luke and EPP Obi, sweet.  I save 3 force.  We race his turn, and I draw high.  He deploys Vader and I It Can Wait him, sweet.  I do some OOC&amp;#8217;s and Insert AFA a bunch of times.  I do suicide runs with EPP Luke and EPP Obi and kill off all his guys.  John just draws up at the end.<br>
<br>
FW +33<br>
<br>
6(+78)<br>
<br>
John told me how gay my deck was and I just laughed (it&amp;#8217;s all good John:))  So pairings are called and we have to play again.  Cool.<br>
<br>
Game 4: HD Liquidy vs. John Irving&amp;#8217;s (1639) WYS SOLID<br>
I think this was Brad&amp;#8217;s deck, so I am like crap because Brad makes killer decks and John can play very well.  I start my usual stuff (go to game 1) and get a Vader in my starting hand.  I activate, get out a docking bay.  Use Crush, get out Holotable with Masterful Move.  Drop Vader to CC: Docking Bay, Visage.  His turn he gets out Mirax on her ship and a docking bay.  Visage.  My turn, activate a lot and drain for 1.  I use We Must Accelerate Our Plans to get the Bridge.  I have Zuckuss in my hand so I might as well go make a run with him against Mirax.  I battle her and draw a 1, so he loses 1 force.  That is gay.  So I move Zuckuss away and I prepare to eat the drain of 3.  Visage.  His turn, he drains for 3 and plays OOC/TT and I cancel with This Is Some Rescue.  He drops Lando and a RFC in Cantina, flips.  Uses C/TV to get a card and then plays it from lost pile.  Gets Dash and his ship with Mirax.  Draws up.  Visage.  I drain, and drop Xizor against Lando and the RFC.  Battle and I draw a 5 so the RFC covers it all and Xizor stays because he couldn&amp;#8217;t draw destiny.  Also, while John was losing cards to Visage he lost the Tripler so I am SO scared of beatdown it isn&amp;#8217;t funny.  I leave Xizor there and I am forced to eat his drain of 3...again.  Visage.  He drains for 5 and deploys Wedge on Dash&amp;#8217;s ship, and then drops Jedi Luke to H1 docking bay.  He forgets to move him, and loses 1 to Visage.  I activate, drain for 3.  Get Maul on Zuckuss&amp;#8217; ship and deploy Tarkin with Vader.  Drop Palpy and Janus to DS docking bay.  Battle with Xizor and he covers it all while John loses Lando.  Move over Zuckuss to Kessel (because he had Melas and Jedi Luke on the ground).  Visage.  His turn he drains for 2 and moves Jedi Luke to Tat. docking bay. and moves Mirax&amp;#8217;s ship to Tat. and Melas to Tat. docking bay. Visage for both of us.  My turn, drain for 5.  Move over Vader and Tarkin to Mos Espa docking bay that he got out.  He cancels Visage, but I have one in hand next turn.  He moves down Mirax&amp;#8217;s ship and prepares to pick up Melas. 1 to Visage.  By now we both only have 1 card in our life force and I drain him out. <br>
<br>
FW +1<br>
<br>
8(+79)  Yah! I finally broke the 3-3 barrier, sweet!<br>
<br>
It was a REALLY close game all the way and John played a very good game.<br>
So I am the only undefeated person left and I have to play my friend, Ryan the next game because he is the closest in dif.<br>
<br>
Game 5: 100% American Cheese vs. Ryan Obman&amp;#8217;s (1779) HD Solid<br>
He starts Crush, IAO combo, and Mob. Points.  I start DODN/WA and show him Podrace Prep and he gets out Sebulba&amp;#8217;s racer.  We race and he flashes and draws a total of 7.  I cancel Visage and it is my turn.  I get A Signal in my hand so I signal for AFA and activate the rest.  Insert AFA, and draw a few and play OOC.  His turn, we race and he draws high again so it his 14 to my 8.  He drops Maul to DS docking bay and draws some.  I activate, drop Boussh to Maul&amp;#8217;s site, get out a system and draw some.  I still haven&amp;#8217;t gotten one of my A Step Backwards.  I play OOC 2 or 3 more times and get his Vader:).  His turn we race and he has 20 now to my 16, crap this doesn&amp;#8217;t look good.  He drops Thrawn and Xizro to a docking bay and says go.  My turn, I drop TK-422 to Thrawns  site and now I have a &amp;#8216;lock&amp;#8217; on him.  I draw some and still haven&amp;#8217;t gotten my ASB, crap. He activates and AFA pops.  We race and he gets 24 and I get 23 or something close.  He drops Janus, Palpy and 4-Lom w/gun to the arena to prepare for a drain of 2.  He loses 4 and draws some.  I play OOC on his lost pile and get some interrupt, blah.  My turn, I activate and draw some to get EPP Obi, Resilence and We&amp;#8217;re You Looking For Me? I play that to get Threepio and his turn.  Also, I didn&amp;#8217;t get ASB, so I have to win just on destines.  We race and I draw 2, 5, 2 while he draws 4+3 which is a 7 and he wins 31-30, CRAP.  This is the second time I lost the race today.  I lose my 6 all from hand and he says go.  My turn I activate enough for EPP Obi and EPP Luke to do a hit run.  I insert AFA, deploy Projection of a Skywalker to Palpy/Janus&amp;#8217; site.  Drop EPP Luke to Palpy/Janus&amp;#8217; site and EPP Obi to Maul&amp;#8217;s site.  Battle for free and cut Palpy and draw high enough to clean the site.  Battle against Maul and draw 2 4&amp;#8217;s, crap.  I draw a 4 or something and I resilence him back because I had another Luke in my hand.  He activates and AFA pops so he loses 4 and my turn.  I insert AFA again and he cancels with Projective Telepathy and I don&amp;#8217;t have my grabber so I can&amp;#8217;t grab it, crap.  I drop EPP Obi against Maul again and miss again and I resilence back.  Ryan only has 4 cards left in his Life Force and I have about 10.  I On The Edge back 4 and now I have 12 Life Force.  He draws up next turn and I win.<br>
<br>
FW +12<br>
<br>
10(+91)<br>
<br>
In that game, I placed 15 cards OOP!  Ryan also told me about he place Mike&amp;#8217;s EPP Maul OOP and how pissed Mike was.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t imagine how pissed Mike would have been if he had played me;)Since Ryan is the highest dif. 4-1 player we play again.  We tested this earlier in the week and I lost by about 15, maybe this time it will be different?<br>
<br>
Game 6: HD Liquidy vs. Ryan Obman&amp;#8217;s (1779) PodProfit Beats<br>
I knew this would be a close game so I had to do my best to take the damage to him.  I start my usual stuff and he is racing.  He starts Goo Nee Tay and I forget to start 2 Aliens in the AC, crap.  I start my usual stuff (go to previous games) and get EPP Vader out first turn to AC.  I realized that shouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened because I only activate 6, oh well:)  He loses 1 to Visage.  I search with Crush and I realize that I took out my Search and Destroy, umm...not good.  He tries to cancel Visage but I play This Is Some Rescue.  Visage.  I get out the Bridge, Holotable, and a Docking Bay so activation will be high next turn.  He also is winning the race because he has 14 to my 9 and I am not playing Sebulba&amp;#8217;s racer.  I leaver EPP Vader and draw some to get Tarkin and Tempest 1, sweet.  Visage.  He just draws some and I can tell he has got some beatdown or something.  Visage.  I drop Tarkin in Tempest 1 to Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace and Xizor, Dr. E, and some guy to AC.  Move Vader out with Tarkin.  Visage.  He now has 24 to my 21 in the race and he deploys some guys to cover for CHYBC, crap.  He saves 6 and cancels Visage.  I activate and drain for 2.  Move Vader and Tarkin over to EPP Obi and draw up to get Palpy and Janus.  He drops some guys at Vader&amp;#8217;s place and battles.  I cut Obi and he misses Vader. I cancel his BD and he loses Obi and some scrub.  He wins the race and I lose 6.  The rest of the game was some small skirmishes and him Resilenceing his @$$ off.  Search and Destroy would have helped me SO frickin much, but I go down by 18.<br>
<br>
FL -18<br>
<br>
10(+73)<br>
<br>
So Ryan wins the tourney on Dif. and I would have won it if my LS would have beaten him by more, oh well.<br>
<br>
