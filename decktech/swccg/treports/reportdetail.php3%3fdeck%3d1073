<br>
OK, I was debating whether I wanted to write a tourney<br>
report which is why I waited a few days before submitting. <br>
I’ve been rebuffed at numerous regionals in the past and<br>
always finish with a 4-2 record and in about 25-30th place. <br>
This year, I was determined to do much better.  I was going<br>
to make new decks based on DSII objectives, but realized<br>
that I didn’t know enough about the cards to make it<br>
smooth and effective.  So I tweaked my ralltiir ops deck<br>
that I had been running for weeks and made some subtle<br>
changes to my baragwin ebo deck that I’ve running almost<br>
since 3rd Anthology was released (Trust me only stole the<br>
Ishi Tib idea from decktech).<br>
<br>
I was suppose to carpool from Lincoln with some other<br>
guys, but they lost my phone number so they couldn’t reach<br>
me.  I drove down by myself and got there plenty early.  I<br>
needed to trade for a few cards.  I got there and traded for<br>
the cards I needed and then waited for a while because the<br>
young jedi tournament run overtime.  I looked around and<br>
quickly saw that I was right to assume that all the big guns<br>
would be in attendance.  We started the first game over an<br>
hour late so it was going to be a long day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1:  My LS Vs  Eric Gonzalez space fleet<br>
<br>
This guy is a local player whose been playing Pokemon<br>
instead of SW for a while.  I start MPG and A New Secret<br>
Base, he starts secret plans, Something Special Planned for<br>
them and some other effect with DS Throne Room.<br>
<br>
The first few turns consisted of us drawing up and<br>
deploying locations, but he was playing scanning crews, so<br>
my Leia’s and Capt Han’s were going away..  I deploy all<br>
my hoth sites and start fishing for systems and next turn he<br>
deploys a tie and pilot to Rendili.  My turn, I deploy a<br>
baragwin  and draw getting Squadron Assignments.  He<br>
drains, I lose a weapon and retrieve.  He deploys kiffex, a<br>
SD, and Chrineau and another pilot to Kiffex.  I deploy<br>
squadron assignments, show Red 5 and get Luke, deploy to<br>
Kiffex.  He deploys another star destroyer and battles, I<br>
hyper escape away to DSII.  when I drain, he reacts with<br>
Emperors Sword, I deploy more  and battle, he loses ship +<br>
some.  This is what the rest of the game consisted of, he<br>
would deploy and battle, I would draw insane destiny and<br>
he would lose a ton, I would use baragwin’s to cover the<br>
drains I couldn’t get to and drain him for the rest.<br>
<br>
FW 33 <br>
2(+33)<br>
<br>
highs- winning big<br>
lows-instead of the easy first game making me calm, it<br>
made me more nervous<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2:  My DS  Vs Kai Wilken’s There is good in<br>
him/scouts<br>
<br>
I start Mob points, Imperial Arrest Order, and Combat<br>
Response.  He starts Strike Planning, Your Insight Serves<br>
You Well, and Staging Area’s<br>
<br>
My starting hand is horrible, no imperial commands, no<br>
ozzel or piett.  I get a raltiir site, get exec docking bay and<br>
deploy a at-st pilot and draw.  He gets Madine and Gen<br>
Solo, deploys Madine and a scout to Endor DB.  I still have<br>
nothing, deploy another docking bay and site, draw.  He<br>
drains me for 2 and deploys more scouts including Midge.<br>
<br>
I still don’t have what I need so I deploy Tempest Scout 1<br>
and AT-ST pilot and move to <br>
Endor DB.  I have two tramples and Tempest Scout 6 in my<br>
hand so I figure I’m safe.  He deploys another scout, then<br>
Chewie (scout) and Gen Solo and Beezer (doh).  I attempt<br>
to trample Beezer so I can react.  I draw a 1.  I attempt to<br>
trample Chewie to decrease his power, I draw a 0.  He<br>
battles and plays Life Debt.  I lose like 7 off the top.  I<br>
should have flipped and just taken the drains.  He’s now<br>
draining me for a lot and I get ops flipped but too late.  I<br>
don’t have the characters.  At one point I could have<br>
deployed Vader/Tarkin to spaceport docking bay with a<br>
tracked 6, but he seemed confident and I thought he had a<br>
surprise.  I deployed them to his bunker and he plays Blast<br>
the Door Kid.  That’s what he was relying on, but the<br>
Spaceport docking bay isn’t interior.  I would have<br>
destroyed most of his force and been able block other<br>
drains.  It was not to be.<br>
<br>
FL -17<br>
2(+16)<br>
<br>
highs-whittling it down to a 17 point win<br>
lows-losing<br>
<br>
Game 3: My DS Vs a Endor Local Uprising start<br>
<br>
I start same, he starts staging areas, Your Insight, and<br>
something else<br>
I’m worried about my dark deck after my beating last round<br>
<br>
I get a great opening hand, Imperial command for Piett, use<br>
him to get Igar, and deploy Piett to Exec DB.  I go get<br>
Fondor with Mobilization Points (yeah, I know fondor isn’t<br>
listed, I grabbed the wrong system that morning, but<br>
nobody noticed, including me, until game 6).  I know I can<br>
flip second turn.  Then he deploys three twix sites from<br>
hand and deploys Lando and Gold Squad 1, I Imperial<br>
Barrier.  What a load of crap, any other start for him and I<br>
would be golden.  I draw up a turn to get some more<br>
protection for the flip.  <br>
He moves Lando over and now has Neim Nub on board.  I<br>
deploy a starfighter and pilot, deploy to the other sites and<br>
then transit from the docking bays and flip.  The rest of the<br>
game was hard fought  because he kept deploy mains to<br>
raltiir and flipping it back repeatedly,  I would kick them<br>
off, but it took a while.  <br>
<br>
FW 8<br>
 4 (+24)<br>
<br>
highs-winning<br>
lows-winning by so little<br>
<br>
we take a lunch break now and I swear, some local guys<br>
ask me if I’m going to drop out.  I can’t believe it.  I only<br>
have 1 loss so I still have a small chance and dropping out<br>
is for punks.<br>
<br>
Game 4:  My LS Vs Frank Morgan’s Ralltiir Ops<br>
<br>
This is not the player I wanted to face, I needed to win the<br>
rest and win big<br>
He starts Imperial decree, Something Special Planned and<br>
something else, I start same<br>
<br>
I’ve played this deck before at the Worlds Wildcard last<br>
year.  He beat me then, but I know his game.  He has<br>
boatloads of systems to get tons of activation.  We’re both<br>
activating insane amounts by turn 4.  I get EBO and<br>
baragwins running.  I get Falcon, Capt Han and Leia to<br>
Ralltiir against his SD with pilots.   He deploys Executor<br>
and lots of pilots.  and battles.  I play out of nowhere so I<br>
draw 4 destiny.  I draw 15 total, not that great given my<br>
average destiny.  He loses three pilots, I lose everything to<br>
attrition.  He spreads out.  I deploy Capt Han, Falcon, and<br>
Leia again next turn to his SD with pilots.  I battle, he<br>
reacts with SD.  I draw a 7, 5, 5.  He loses everything but<br>
an SD, I’m immune.<br>
The rest of the game was him running away from me.  He<br>
flipped Ralltiir briefly, but I came down with Obi and Luke<br>
and controlled ralltiir for the rest of the game.  <br>
<br>
FW 25<br>
6 (+49)<br>
<br>
highs-beating Frank Morgan and getting a good differential<br>
lows-none<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5:  My LS Vs Tim Schartz ?  Ralltiir Ops<br>
<br>
He start’s same as Frank, I start same.<br>
<br>
He had apparently never seen the baragwin thing before,<br>
because he was really impressed by all those destiny 7s. <br>
This game was very similar to my game with Frank.  He’d<br>
flip ralltiir, I’d flip it back.  I’d battle him in space and he<br>
would lose lots to attrition.  at the end, I should have<br>
retrieved before I battled, but I had only tracked my<br>
destinies towards to bottom so I ended the game<br>
accidentally.<br>
<br>
FW 20<br>
8 (+69)<br>
<br>
highs-going 3-0 with my LS<br>
lows-winning by less than I could have<br>
Game 6: My DS Vs some guy’s Hidden Base (I should<br>
remember his name, but I was so nervous by now that it<br>
escapes me)<br>
<br>
I start same, he starts HB and Haven.  By this point, I was<br>
at the fourth game from the top.  I knew I needed to win big<br>
if I had a prayer of getting in the final confrontation.<br>
He deploys ships fast and moves to Endor for drain.  I<br>
deploy DB, some characters and try to get Fondor (this is<br>
when I realize my mistake).  so I draw the rest.  He drains, I<br>
take it.  Next turn I flip.  From here it was just a matter of<br>
whittling down his forces.  I had Search and Destroy going<br>
and eventually trampled his spy Han and Leia.  He got a<br>
few drains in at kessel, but they didn’t hurt me that much.  I<br>
was really stressed out by the end.<br>
<br>
FW 20<br>
10 (+89)<br>
<br>
<br>
I leave and start talking to the players above me when they<br>
finish.  It looks like I leapfrogged them all and we’re<br>
waiting for the final game which times out.  I know the<br>
tourney director, but he won’t tell me the losers<br>
differential.  I had to wait through 78 placings before they<br>
announced that the final confrontation would be between<br>
me and Joshua Smith.  I couldn’t believe it, I was so happy<br>
to get here that I didn’t care whether I won or lost.  <br>
<br>
He chooses DS first because he was first place.<br>
<br>
He starts Bring him Before me and some junk including<br>
Mobilization Points and Battle Plan.  I start same<br>
<br>
He deploys the Emperor to Tat. DB first turn.  I deploy<br>
sites and a baragwin.  he deploys Vader and stick to 4th<br>
marker.  Next turn I deploy Luke w/stick from reserve and<br>
obi w/stick to Emperor.  I battle trusting my high destiny.  I<br>
miss with the first saber, but hit with the second and draw a<br>
five, he draws a 1.  He loses 10 off the top including his<br>
other emperor.  That really was the game.  He deployed<br>
more on the ground and eventually captured Luke and<br>
circled obi, but that just hurt him with the flip side of his<br>
objective.  I drained him in space and won.<br>
<br>
FW 24<br>
2(+24)<br>
<br>
OK, all I have to do is lose by less than that.<br>
<br>
I start same for DS, he starts  HB, strike planning, and<br>
something else.  <br>
He deploys fast to Rendezvous Point and moves to Endor. <br>
I do my same mojo with db and characters and then draw. <br>
He moves to raltiir with some ships after deploying his own<br>
ralltiir.  I deploy a starfighter and stuff to ralltiir and flip. <br>
Then shuttle starfighter down.  He deploys more in space.  I<br>
get search and destroy.  Then I start coming to space with<br>
my small fleet including Baron and his buds in the Onyx’s. <br>
He deploys a cloud and flips raltiir back.  I flip it back next<br>
turn, but move my baron and another pilot in onyx to<br>
clouds to do it.  This was really the only mistake I made<br>
this game, Wedge/ship had a xwing laser cannon and I<br>
forgot that I was maneuver -2 in the clouds,  He deploys<br>
another starfighter and tries to eliminate the Baron...he<br>
draws a 1.  Yes, My baron has a gun and I quickly<br>
eliminate wedge and then beat down on his remaining fleet. <br>
At this point he tells the TD he only has 16 cards remaining<br>
and no retrieval.  He concedes.  And I win the regional!<br>
<br>
Finally, I get my chance at worlds!!!!!!<br>
