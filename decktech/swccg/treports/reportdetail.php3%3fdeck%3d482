until I called Woj at like 1:30 am asking about him having a ruling that<br>
was made and if he could print it out and bring it...he does and will!<br>
Sweet!  I now have some sick LS tech.  I wake up 4 hours later and get<br>
showered and suck then leave at 7am for Woj to pick him up.  I get there,<br>
he gives me the printouts and we leave for Time Warp around 8:20.<br>
<br>
We show up, the place is empty except for a few of the NJ locals...I go on<br>
and fill out my decklists and place the respective names, 'Anktopot' and<br>
'Juz's Revenge' the go about plugging RCon with my new Handouts from<br>
Kinkos.  Even though they screwed the printing up, they came out sweet.<br>
After Ghetto Squad comes with Dan Bordier Burger King hats and Dalton and<br>
company show up we get started to play.  Someone left their wallet at BK<br>
so we wait a few minutes for him then start up.  We only have 19 people<br>
but some very good players.  Heck even Andrew Parks showed up.  So for the<br>
last few weeks everyone has been expecting me to play Y4 mains because I<br>
have been testing like mad with it, but I didn't like it. Plus Charlie<br>
Herren and I were throwing around a Suicide Hunt Down deck with<br>
Screws,Odds, and lots of direct damage but that sucked so I went with my<br>
two decks, with a little extra tech in them ;).<br>
<br>
Game One  My DS Vs Thomas Hermley-Keen's RTP (1658)<br>
Thomas is an up and coming player here in Coruscant and he even took it<br>
too me last week in Clarks Summit and beat me so I needed to have some<br>
revenge here. My opening draw I get Darth Vader so I drop him, pull Leia<br>
into my hand and move to the D* DB and also pulled out the Exec:DB and<br>
Coruscant so I was generating a good amount of force.  I eventually get<br>
out Tempest 1 and ECC IG-88 with Darth at the D*DB when he drops<br>
Orimaarko, EPP Han, and a 2/2 scrub, I think.  He played Captive Pursuit<br>
to target Leia so if he won the battle he would she would be released.<br>
Before he battles I play Put All Sections On Alert to cancel Orimaarko's<br>
Text and ability to draw destiny.  He shoots at IG and Misses, I capture<br>
the 2/2 scrub so now he doesn't get destiny.  I play I Have You Now and end<br>
up losing no one and he loses everything plus some more.  Everything went<br>
right for me for this game.<br>
<br>
FW +40<br>
2 (+40)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Getting Vader and taking Leia early on to stop flipping.<br>
Lowlights- None, Everything was great<br>
<br>
So I know that Lolli, Dalton, and Woj won so I am curious who I play. I<br>
end up playing Pat Brennen but he is using the name (Dark Jedi) and<br>
actually has a rating so this should be interesting.<br>
<br>
Game 2 My LS Vs Dark Jedi's Jabba's Palace deck. (1547)<br>
<br>
So I start my Y4 stuff and he starts JP and Careful Plans for Lars<br>
Moisture Farm so I am thinking of a type of Holman/Brentson Scum Deck.  He<br>
has always been a good player so I needed to make sure I played this well.<br>
This game was pretty uneventful with me beating the crap out of all the<br>
aliens with my EPP/Tawss Hit Squads and having him losing 18 to Odds.  I<br>
even had Tibrin going and retrieving Mains at will to battle some more.<br>
Very Ugly game, especially because he didn't play Odd's protection.  He was<br>
able to play Vaders at will but tracking destinies I was able to draw 5's<br>
left and right.  He never played Scum so I had no idea what the idea of<br>
the deck was.<br>
<br>
FW +30<br>
4 (+70)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Once again my LS deck worked perfectly<br>
Lowlights- Odds only popped twice<br>
<br>
So now my diff is higher by far than anyone else's.  I know Dalton, Woj won<br>
but Lolli lost to Brian Kim and his profit because of Fallen Portal.  I<br>
have to play Woj.<br>
<br>
Game 3 My LS Vs Wojciech Jankowski's Ray Bordier Occu@#$% deck (2005)<br>
<br>
I do not think I have ever beaten Woj in my life so but I knew that I<br>
could so I wondered how things could go.  I start my Y4 start he plays<br>
Yavin IV and Jungle with the SI that lets him play Secret Plans,<br>
Resistance and There Is Not Try.  I get a nudj, draw some.  He<br>
plays the swamp and converts.  Pulls bubo, moves to the nudj and eats.<br>
This game went very slow in the beginning with my mains beating on his<br>
characters but then he spreads out and drops the Big E with Occupation.  I<br>
took out the Endor Celebration which ended up killing me here but there<br>
was some fun moments during this game.  One point he had Vader Tarkin and<br>
Arden at the Forest, I drop EPP Leia and Luke battle, retrieve with DTF he<br>
loses one.  I swing at Tarkin draw a 2, then 5 (he cancels it).  I shoot<br>
at Arden and hit.  I play The Force is Strong with this one and<br>
Skywalkers.  I end up having a power 31 to his 14.  He loses everyone but<br>
not much damage is take from it.  I lose Leia. Another great moment was<br>
when I had 3 cards in hand late game and he took a chance by dropping<br>
Nement to a site by him self hoping I didn't have a character.  My turn I<br>
activate 15 and Tunnel Vision...he craps him self.  I know that Tawss,<br>
Leia and Luke are still in the 30 cards in my piles but when I looked I<br>
had nothing!!!  Crap.  I ended up making it close with a late game insert<br>
and WNMOG on the table but He didn't need to activate and Occupation put<br>
the nail in the coffin....<br>
<br>
FL -7<br>
4(+63)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Beating the piss out of the Three musketeers with Leia and<br>
Luke<br>
Lowlights- deploying EPP Leia to bubo's site without a destiny draw. Duh.<br>
Not beating Woj again...<br>
<br>
So I am in third place now and Dalton too but played the same side as Woj<br>
so I get to play Dalton...another person I haven't beat since 1998 maybe!<br>
<br>
Game 4 My DS Vs Mike Dalton's Y4 mains deck (1958)<br>
This matchup we have done time and time again and I always lose for some<br>
reason...;)  I was going to play this light deck before I decided against<br>
it because I felt more prepared with mine.  He dropped Obi at the D*:DB<br>
pretty early with Boush Undercover to the Holotheatre then also dropped<br>
Tawss to the Holo to cancel Visage.  Plus with Boush Undercover at the<br>
Executor sites, CHYBC would not cancel drains at the sites.  My turn I<br>
drop Vader and beat on Obi, Vader stays because of Put All Sections and I<br>
flip Hunt Down. His turn he tries to drain and I remind him that the<br>
objective is flipped and because of Leia at the same site at Tawss he<br>
cannot initiate drains.  He just moves Tawss to the Med Chamber.  I drop<br>
Mara to the Holotheathe and Deploy Visage again so he loses again.  His<br>
turn he drains for 2 I take it.  He deploys obi again to Vader's site with<br>
Luke.  I put all sections Luke and he battles.  He hits Vader, I hit Obi<br>
and play I Have You Now.  I draw some good destiny so he loses both and a<br>
bunch.  I lose Vader, Evader him to the used pile then play Holonet to<br>
take him back into my hand.  My turn I drop Vader to Tawss site and kill<br>
off that guy while moving back into the D*:DB.  This game went back and<br>
forth for a while until he dropped Obi at the Swamp killed off the nudj<br>
and broke cover with Boush to kill of Mara with a tracked 4.  After to<br>
killed the nudj I reminded him that the nudj had to draw destiny.  He drew<br>
it but didn't have any left to draw in a battle now so It became my turn.<br>
Mara beat on Leia with the aid of Put All Sections and Visage was safe<br>
still. I then pulled of the best part of the game.  I deployed EPP Vader<br>
to the swamp and battles Obi-Wan.  I swung and hit then You Are Beaten Him<br>
to end the battle and kill him before he got destiny.  Nice.  After that he<br>
drew up because he had no characters left.<br>
<br>
FW +12<br>
6 (+75)<br>
<br>
Highlights- The You are beaten on Obi; Finally beating Mike<br>
Lowlights- Dengar going after Tawss early game and not hitting her.<br>
<br>
So now I am back to second place with Woj the only undefeated. I play him<br>
again and Brian Kim plays Dalton.<br>
<br>
Game 5 My DS Vs Woj's Obi's Hut Force Choke. (2005)<br>
<br>
I finally get a chance to revenge.  I wish I could remember any of it<br>
though.  I mostly remember taking over his Tatooine sites with At-At's and<br>
Vader while making him lose to Visage and battles.  I think at this point<br>
I was just getting so damb excited I had a chance to win states.  He got<br>
desperate with playing the Tontine late game but Slave 1 fixed that.  He<br>
also dropped Jeron and cancelled Visage then moved to the revoed Med<br>
Chamber.  My turn, I evadered it then Put Darth down and made him Ghkkk.<br>
The last straw was beating on Obi with Tempest 1 and DLots and drawing a 6<br>
when he drew a 1 for destiny.  I wish I could remember more...my deck was<br>
the antichrist to his though.<br>
<br>
FW +13<br>
8 (+88)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Finally beat Woj!<br>
Lowlights- Drawing 3 destiny in the game and drawing 1,1,and 2.  That<br>
never happens.<br>
<br>
So I am in first place right now but I played Woj twice and Dalton plated<br>
the same side as me.  I end up playing the second highest player for the<br>
DS, Pete Flamini while Woj and Dalton play each other.<br>
<br>
Game 6 My LS Vs Pete Flamini's ROps (1736)<br>
<br>
Before the game we were all joking how Pete was the guys that would be the<br>
Spoiler for someone...here was the chance.<br>
<br>
I start my Y4 stuff and he starts Raltiir and Resistance...gee go figure<br>
;).  Pete knows my deck has odds so of course he starts it...he had to.  We<br>
have never played before so this was sure to be a fun game.   For the<br>
first few turns we just drew and played sites.  On my 4th turn I dropped<br>
Artoo, 8d8, Tibrin, RL in R1 and Red Squad and told him done.  His turn I<br>
asked him how much he was going to activate and he said 8.  After the 7th<br>
card, insert popped and he had to lose 11 cards.  That turn he flipped the<br>
objective and waited.  I dropped BO and WNMOG so I tried kicking on his<br>
planed and deployed Leia, he barriered her and then beat on her with<br>
Tempest 1 and some pilots.  I drew a 5 which helped so she covered it.  I<br>
then started dropping mains and tawss with Mech Failure trying to take him<br>
out.  With his objective flipped I lost my guys but also was able to bring<br>
them back with DTF and Tibrin working for me.  I eventually got him off<br>
his planet and won.<br>
<br>
FW +24<br>
10 (+118)<br>
<br>
<br>
Highlights-  Using Tibrin and DTF to recycle cards that I needed and to<br>
get my cards back.<br>
Lowlights- Never flipping the objective even though he lost everyone.<br>
<br>
So I ended up winning plays 5 different people that know the game very<br>
well and 2 of them I never beat before.  I get the spot to GenCon with<br>
Dalton and get some WB Dagobah to complete my silly quest for playing all<br>
WB cards...<br>
<br>
Props<br>
