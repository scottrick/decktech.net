Pre-tourney crap:<br>
About a week before Tatooine&#146;s release, I ordered two boxes from allstartradingcards.com, they have good prices and the cards get to me (usually) 2 days after I order them.  So on Friday, I come home to find a shipping boxes containing my two boxes. I do notice that it&#146;s a little small, though.  I push the thought aside as I hurredly tear the box open. Hmm...there&#146;s only one box.  Dam.n. So I call up, they say they made a mistake and they&#146;ll have the next box to me by Monday. Well, that&#146;s all fine and dandy but I have a tournament to go to on Sunday (hence the report), so I guess I won&#146;t be able to test Tatooine as much as I wanted to. Long story short, Tatooine&#146;s distribution sucks, but not for me. I managed to pull 2 Mauls (1 AI), 3 Qui Gons, both racers, all of the effects, and not many other doubles leaving me only 5 cards short of the set. Unfortunately, of those 5 I really needed two for my new LS deck, Padme and Qui Gon&#146;s stick. Oh well.<br>
I threw together my new decks that night, which happened to be mains for both sides.<br>
Light was Careful Planning to get the Slave Quarters and the Lars&#146; Moisture Farm, grab Shmi with the SQ, she grabs Threepio, drop him to the LMF, and HDWGITM for my other sites.<br>
Dark was COTVG, for generation and direct damage, with plenty of mains and sabers floating around.<br>
<br>
We (me and two of my scrubby friends) get to the store a couple minutes late and notice that there&#146;s a pretty good sized crowd.  A little while later, after Round 1 ended, more late people showed up and we managed to get 16 people in all. My rating going into this tournament is 1584 after 24 games, but that&#146;s 3 tournaments behind and I should be in the mid 1600s.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs. Ted Cohen (1515) SYCFA Mains<br>
This guy looked easy to beat. He used SYCFA as his platform to get some mains running around, but that&#146;s pretty much it.<br>
First turn he drops CC: Port Town District and draws. My turn, deploy Ben&#146;s Hut, pull Shmi and Threepio, but I couldn&#146;t find any HDWGITM, so I draw and get none. His turn, Mara w/o saber and EPP Fett go to the PTD and he drops some random CC site. My turn, drop EPP Luke and ECC Chewie to the PTD, initiate, he has First Strike so I retrieve while he loses, swing and hit Mara, Mess her, he hits Chewie and I miss Fett. He has power 5 to my 12, there goes Fett and 2. I lose Chewie. His turn, he gets the D* War Room, drops Janus to the D*DB, deploys a bunch of Effects that don&#146;t do anything to me and draws. All this time, I have been recycling 5&#146;s and 6&#146;s with Threepio and stuff, but I can&#146;t find any Edges. My turn, drain for 2 at the PTD, drop the City Outskirts and get Qui Gon, deploy Ben Kenobi + saber to his Hut, move him over to Qui Gon, and draw. Hooray, Owen and Beru and a Harvest! His turn, 4-Lom and somebody else come down to Luke&#146;s site and battle, Luke gets his text cancelled, and both Luke and whoever the other person was die, leaving a lone 4Lom. My turn, drain for a few, Lando with Ax goes to the D* War Room, Boushh with broken cover and Owen + Beru go to the LMF, Harvest, his go. His turn, he tries to Revealed Lando, but I point out that it&#146;s JUST deployed. He drops Choke Vader to the City Outskirts, battles, Weapon Levitates Obi&#146;s saber, tries to use it but I tell him he can&#146;t, he tries to Choke Qui Gon (wtf?), and I draw a tracked 6 to kill Vader.  He draws a 5, so I ignore Qui Gon&#146;s immunity and revive him with Ben. My turn, drain for a good amount, Harvest, drop EPP Han to the PTD and draw a few. For the rest of the game, I just drained while he drew to get something useful. In the end, I drew my whole force pile looking for an Edge, not realizing how much I drew. I drain him out for the win.<br>
FW 2(+29)<br>
2(+29)<br>
<br>
Highlights: My deck worked like it was supposed to and I got an easy win<br>
Lowlights: Drawing a lot in the end, I could&#146;ve won by like 40<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs. Thomas Carchidi (1596) Podracing<br>
I had expected racing, so I threw Anakin&#146;s Pod in my light deck, but I forgot to put Sebulba&#146;s in my dark. So while I&#146;m losing the race, I&#146;m also dropping mains and draining. He has EPP Obi at the Tosche Station, but I come down with Maul and his saber. We battle, he tries to Clash, but I lose 1 to Crush to cancel it. We both missed with our sabers and Obi died to attrition. At one point, he has Lando and Padme(?) at one of his sites. I drop Lord Vader with his crappy saber and someone else and initiate. Chop Lando and play Sniper &amp; Dark Strike  to make him lost. He tries to play Too Close For Comfort to make me pay 2 or cancel the targeting, but I say he has to do it before I draw my weapon destinies. He politely asks me to give him a chance for actions from now on and take the game a little slower, and I agree because I don&#146;t like to be rushed either. He loses some mains to Savrip and keeps Padme. The race ended during my move phase, he had 25, so we lost/retrieved accordingly. His turn, he plays I Did It and retrieves 4, deploys Qui Gon with Padme&#146;s text and we battle. I miss Qui Gon, and Padme and somebody of mine die, leaving the two lone Jedi. He moves over a site. My turn, I start draining for a lot, so I decide not to follow. Eventually, I converge on Qui Gon with Maul, and leave him with nowhere to run, but I drain him out before we battle.<br>
FW 2(+12)<br>
4(+41)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Beating down on Padme<br>
Lowlights: Savrip after beating down on Padme, and racing<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs. Pete Flamini (1834) Tatooine Mains<br>
He&#146;s playing almost the exact same deck as me, so I know how to beat it. The only probably is that it&#146;s hard to beat. He sets up early with Jedi Luke, his saber, Naked Threepio, Shmi, and EPP Han at the Cantina in only a few turns. I only let him drain for a turn or two, and I come down with Maul, 4Lom, and Xizor. We battle and I play I Have You Know first thing, forgetting that it counts as my first action. Han caps Xizor, 4-Lom cancels Luke&#146;s text, because I hoped to kill him with attrition, but after the battle I realized I should&#146;ve cancelled Han&#146;s text to cancel his destiny. Luke slices Maul, and I draw crazy high destinies, 16 total. Everybody dies but Luke. Dam.n, there goes the whole friggin&#146; point of the battle. For the rest of the game, we just run around with what little characters we have and drain. We have a few more little skirmishes, but nothing important. Very blody game. In the end, his drain at the Cantina is probably what won him the game. If I had played smarter in the battle, maybe it would&#146;ve turned out different.<br>
FL -15<br>
4(+26)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
LS vs. Bill Kafer (1408) COTVG Beats<br>
Geez, I hate playing my friends. Personally, I think Bill is underrated because he can give me a real good game from time to time. Fortunately for me, this would not be one of those times. He gets Baby Jabba and Elephant Man to the AC in two turns. I drop Boushh (he forgot about Elephant Man) undercover for a turn. Next turn, drop Lando with Ax (what&#146;s the point of Elephant Man in your deck if you can&#146;t remember him? oh well, if I had remembered him than I probably would&#146;ve willingly not deployed those people) and Worrt, the King. Break Boushh&#146;s cover, Worrt eats Jabba, we battle. I draw decent so he loses Elephant Man and 9 or so. He lost a LOT of key cards, and the rest of the game was just butter. I denied everything he did, except in space because I don&#146;t have much. Goo Ne Tay and The Camp stopped almost all of his characters, so my characters ran amuck drain for insane amounts. He drew up before I could Harvest/Edge some life back.<br>
FW +21<br>
6(+47)<br>
<br>
Highlights: My deck playing excellent<br>
Lowlights: Playing a friend<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs. Pete Flamini (1834) Nice Dark Deck<br>
I don&#146;t want to give away too much detail about Pete&#146;s deck, in case him and Greg are using it at Ramapo. All I&#146;ll say is that it beat me because I didn&#146;t have any space, but space is not the key to winning against this deck. I did manage to make it a close game, though. Two more turns and I would&#146;ve had it.<br>
FL -9<br>
6(+38)<br>
<br>
Highlights: After the game, Pete asked me how long I had been playing because he only started seeing me at tourneys recently. I said that I was fairly new at the tourney scene, and Pete said I was a pretty good player. I felt pretty good hearing that, especially after my horrible performance today.<br>
Lowlights: Sometimes wins are few and far between. Too few and too far, which leads me into my next game.<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
My DS vs. John Lolli (1865) RST with helper effect and Podracing<br>
Criminy, I hate playing against John. I always seem to play against, and lose to, him at every tournament I go to.<br>
He started by filling up the Bunker and winning the race. I had some early drains going with Gailid, Palpy, and Janus (even Visage at the Holotheatre), and I was holding on to 2 Vaders, a Mara, and Maul among other things. Unfortunately, he blew the Bunker and there goes my amazing hand and an 8 card force loss. He drained at the Back Door and the RLS, but he had to pay for Battle Plan then declined. Then, down came Home One with Ackbar and Hashh&#146;n to kill Zuckuss at Rendili, but I Barriered Home One. My turn, drain, and I initiated against Home One, just in case he had more space to deploy, and I lost Zuckuss + 5 off the top. On his next turn, Jedi Luke came down to the AC, at which point I realized that I had forgotten about COTVG for a couple turns. He chased me around in Jabba&#146;s Palace, but his drains where to much for me. In a last ditch effort, I dropped Mara with a Vibro Ax to confront Chewie and Han at the Landing Site. Mara excluded Han and beat up on Chewie, but no overflow. He drained me out shortly thereafter.<br>
FL -17<br>
6(+21)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Visage of the Emperor draining at the Holotheatre, now that&#146;s old school!<br>
Lowlights: Losing to John yet again, that puts me at 0-3 lifetime against him<br>
<br>
So I finished they day going 3-3, which disappointed me a little. I did finish 6th out of 16, though, which isn&#146;t too bad considering the high amount of good players in attendance. If had hadn&#146;t drawn so much in game 1, I could&#146;ve taken 5th, but whatever. Here&#146;s the standings:<br>
<br>
John Lolli  10 +80 <br>
Pete Flamini  10 +43<br>
Brian Kim  8 +74<br>
Doug Faust  6 +62<br>
Ted Panczyszyn 6 +23<br>
Greg Shaw 6 +21<br>
Jared Napolitano 6 +15<br>
Bob Caton  6 -14<br>
Patrick Moore  6 -39<br>
Greg Hodur  5 +52<br>
Alexander Bagasra  4 -5<br>
Bill Kafer 4 -59<br>
Jonathan Dansbury  4 -73<br>
Jerry Yeager  3 -50<br>
Thomas Carchidi  2 -41<br>
Ted Cohen   1 -76<br>
<br>
Props:<br>

To Nathan Brown for running a nice tourney, and for entering it in Scrye<br>
To Jared, for trading me an EPP Leia<br>
To Great Traditions for having almost enough room<br>
To Great Traditions for not having enough room, forcing Ted to play on the counter almost every game, hehe<br>
To that guy who played Jawas, Jawas are the shiznit<br>
The usual props to Ghetto Squad, so I can get a 5 from Ghetto Leader<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
To All Star for not giving me my other box<br>

To everything else that needs a slop<br>
<br>
