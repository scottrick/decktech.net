I want to go at least 3-3 which I thought was a fairly decent goal considering all of the great players that were going to be there.  I will try not to bore you with Pre-game details I get up and make the 1 hour trek into Seattle, the tournament is suppose to start at 10 so I was aiming to get there at 9 register, trade and get ready.  I get there about ten till 9 and pay for parking (1 of several draw backs of having tournaments in at WotCGC) and walk 2 blocks to Wizards of the Coast Game Center and find out they do not even open till 10.  This does not help my mood so I haul my stuff 3 blocks down to Denny*s, eat and pick up a sandwich to have later for lunch.  I get back right at 10 and they had already let several people in.  I see a few people that I know, a few I have seen before and a lot I have never seen.  We finally get started at 11:30.<br>
<br>
LS I am running a HB with Freighters, RFC*s, mains, and B-wings with Kessel runs to retrieve. <br>
<br>
DS is a standard court with what turned out to be a big mistake Vader with saber and GMT in for stuff off Tat.<br>
<br>
I will post both decks later this week.<br>
<br>
I am going into this with a 1385 rating and hoping to improve that situation.<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
D.J. Peralta (1828 ranked 427th in the world) Ops on Ralltiir vs. DS<br>
<br>
I start the usual Court with No Bargain; he starts usual Ops with Nightfall.  Well, I expect spies and ops but do not know what else. I draw crap deploy EJP 4Lom to the AC (Doh!) and lose to Court.  He deploys a Bothan spy for free and an Op to the Farm and gets down Forest and Swamp.  I deploy Sarlacc to the pit and lose and draw.  He deploys another of the same pair to the swamp.  He then wind chimes and for an Op and deploys the Op and Obi with saber to the forest and flips. I get Z in MH out to Tatooine and deploy Jabba*s sail barge and Pote to the Pit but I can not drain because of his flip at least he is the one losing to court now.  He does nothing and I deploy Jodo Kast and GMT w Mandalorian Armor on, to the farm and battle. He draws 2 Destiny (which I just realized is another mistake I let him get away with Ops can not use ability to draw destiny) and another for power only (Night Fall) he drew a 1,3, 1.  I use Jodo*s text to cancel the (3) and draw destiny (the other thing I let get away I should have been drawing for night fall as well). I win the battle and he forfeits the Ops I had deployed All Wrapped Up.  I draw and say go he starts by using wind chimes to get an op and deploy but I stop him and we call the TD to clarify because I say he can not deploy an Op because of the one I have captured there.  I am right so he sits back and decides to do a beat down. He deploys EPP Luke, EPP Han and Boushh (Free) he shoots misses Jodo then slashes Jodo and hits.  He draws 3 destiny (canceled 1 with Jodo) plus Nightfall and I draw 1 destiny. He loses Boushh and clears me off.  I am losing 7 a turn to drains and cannot stop the bleeding. He says go I can not drain so I take it to him I deploy Naido Gudag, EPP Bob and Bane Malar to the farm and pump up Naido with three force and Intiate battle and realize I do not have enough force to mind scan (I was going to scan Han for the extra Destiny draw.   So I am screwed, he had a Twass at the Ac Which I should have battled instead but I am scrub. When all is said and done I lose everybody he lost Luke and the Han that I shot.  By now he drains me out after a couple of skirmishes.   FL  38<br>
<br>
0 (-38)<br>
<br>
Highlights: not much<br>
<br>
LL: Picking the wrong fight, letting him get away with moves that are not allowed.  Not drawing the extra destiny for Nightfall.<br>
<br>
Well my DS was the one I was planning on winning with. And I did not realize until the 3rd game that I should have been drawing for Nightfall. I am not sure whether I would have won that game but the differential definitely would have been lower.  <br>
<br>
This put me in the Last Pair for game to so I figure I have a good shoot at winning.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
Jonathan Wong (no rating first Tournament) ISB VS LS<br>
<br>
I am not sure how to play as I have not seen an ISB deck before so I start Conservative and Play Rebel Fleet for a starter.  I draw what I think is a GOD hand. I get EPP Leia, ECC Chewie, EPP Obi, S &amp; K Corp, a Roche system and Lando in Falcon.  I get set up by Turn 4 and Flip and beef up Kessel and Kiffex (still have not been able to get a hold of a light side Coruscant) and I can drain for five in space and do not want to spread out for fear of the big ships.  He only had out Lars MF and Coruscant DB he had EPP Boba and a scrub at the DB and Blizzard 1 and Probe droid at the farm.   So after I flip I drop Obi and Liea to the farm I miss the droid with Leia but slashed it with Obi. I played Slight Weap. Mal. And drew 2 Destiny clearing him out.  I drain most of the game for 6 or seven he gets no drains gets Executor to Kashyyyk and a DSSD to Ralltiir we skirmish a bit and I kill the DSSD, steering clear of the Executor.  I drain him out FW by 34.<br>
<br>
2 (-4)<br>
<br>
HL: Toasting Blizzard 1, controlling the whole game without having to spread and drain, deck working nearly perfectly.<br>
<br>
LL: having to beat a new guy <br>
<br>
I figure I am ok as this win will put me at the low end of the 1-1 crowd.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
Ping Vongphackdy (No rating at this time) COTVG vs. LS<br>
<br>
He starts off all worried cause he believes his deck does not fair well against space decks. So I spend a little time getting him to chill out.  We start and I decide it is not worth wasting cards on Tat. And will take the loss of force each turn which works out because have the time we both forget I am suppose to be losing to it.  I get set up in five turns and flip after his deploy phase. He is using Galid to boost his drains but I am canceling 3 of them I was able to get Savrip out (I bought 1 for a buck after my last tournament) and I am Draining like made in space I cover Kessel with a B-wing Loaded and an x-wing and set up for Kessel runs I get one run done and have both Kessel and Ralltiir covered he deploys Mist hunter and Zuckuss as pilot to Kessel and battles I can not draw destiny but the loaded being blasts him with a Proton torp. And I lose Tk422 and obi from hand with  Savrip.  We keep draining I am out draining him and complete another Run and retrieve. He Deployed HT w/ Bossk as pilot against 2 b-Wings one with an ion Cannon.  I ionize HT and forfeit w Savrip to cover attrition which really pi$$ed him off. I decide not to draw the rest of the game, If I had I might have been able to get 1 more run in, and drain him out. FW (15)<br>
<br>
4 (+9)<br>
<br>
HL: 2 Kessel runs complete. Dominating Space , Retrieving with S &amp; K Corp., Savrip.<br>
<br>
LL: low differential, beating a non rated player, having a higher differential than I should have because we both forgot about Court.<br>
<br>
Now I am worried this but me at the bottom of the 2-1 group and I am feeling a little out of place some where just above the half mark of 67 players.<br>
Game 4:<br>
Jason Dennee (1872 ranked 246th in the world) ANSB/EBO Vs. DS<br>
<br>
The game is delayed because of a pairing mix up and I find out that he is from Montana (did not find out how good he was until today).  He starts out and setup for EBO I setup Court and I drain while he stays away.  Finally gets a system setup and draining I try to take him out and EBO just keeps blowing away my ships. He comes after me and I try to fend him off but I can not draw for squat.  He drains me out, not much to report.  FL 35<br>
<br>
4 (-26)<br>
<br>
HL: none I could have done better with better draws.<br>
LL: Force choking myself I did draw any of my sites the few times I did battle I drew my Ord Mantell system for 2 battle Destinies and 1 weapon.  Over whelming sense of WTH happened.<br>
<br>
Did someone get the license # of that x-wing that just hammered me.<br>
This was a blow but at least I am at a level in the Tournament that I feel comfortable I can pull a win out.<br>
<br>
Game 5:<br>
Jason Miller (1483) Tatooine Celebration VS DS<br>
<br>
Well I deploy all my stuff and he starts Lars* Farm I get my Krayt dragon in my draw so second turn I have  and alien at the Ac and second turn I drop the dragon at the unoccupied farm. He has been drawing and saving for while I setup to drains. He finally plays Tamtel and a Monk and scrub at Mos eisley that he deployed and says go.  I move the dragon to Mos eisley and say go. He does nothing and the dragon eats Tamtel and he move to the farm.  I drop Ord Mantell and deploy ZinMH for a drain.  He drops Tat. and falcon and Capt. Han.  I deploy Mara and others to the farm battle and he loses Master Luke to cover and I forgot to use All Wrapped Up. He  moves the survivors to Mos. I am trying not to spread out because he seems to be working toward a beat down. The dragon eats a few scrubs that escape the battle trying to get to the cantina and decide during his next turn that he will attack the dragon and deploys DOS  and other and can not do it. Dragon eats DOS.  At this point I am draining him severely and only activate when I drain using Jabba*s text and retrieving when I Battle him.  I get tired of the drain at Tatooine early and had move Z to block and I Decide to Deploy BinHT and battle. Get 2 destiny and his is reduced to zero.  The clears him form space and the planet is empty thanks to the dragon and I court and drain him out. FW by 36<br>
<br>
6(+10)<br>
<br>
YES!!!! I accomplished my goal with 1 game left.  I am the lowest LS 3-2  so I get to play the highest 2-3 DS.<br>
<br>
Game 6:<br>
Bryant Woo (1580) Borrowed RalOps  VS LS<br>
<br>
He borrowed this deck and it showed he played very slow the hole game but was a nice guy unfortunately the pace through me off.  It took him  a long time to get setup and I never got flipped because I was trying to take him out on the ground rather than just play my deck and then worry about his. This cost me the game I forgot at least 3 times to get a system out I was getting my mains but I was not very affective because of the deploy cost of rebels on the Ral. I finally got TK-422 undercover and EPP Leia out to his forest with Arnet and Marquand I drew 3-battle destiny after shooting Marquand SWM, Leia is With Han even though he is undercover and her ability. He put Mara at the space port and I dropped obi and slashed her. This Cleared the sight except for Han but I for got to move have to block drains until it was to late. He took me out in space and I was drawing crap and could not find what I needed.  Basically I handed him the he kept draining until time was called and he had about 10 more force than I did. I could not draw ships or RFC*s to save my life.  Timed loss  by 26<br>
<br>
HL Liea beating the imperials not much else<br>
<br>
LL: Beating myself I should have won I got way sloppy and it cost me the game.<br>
<br>
In the end I was 6 (-16) in about 38th Place.  Not a bad jump from the last tournament.  <br>
<br>
I did not stick around for the final match at 11:00 hours and facing another hour to get home I was not sticking around.<br>
<br>
Over all HL: meeting my goal having my decks work perfectly in 3 games, Kessel Run, Krayt dragon, S &amp; l Corp.<br>
<br>
Over all LL: L5R tourn. people yelling Bonsai at the end of each of their games, Paying $10 for parking. People, from our group, who were not paying attention and dragging out the Tournament.  Over booking by the WotCGC people again. <br>
<br>
Well after this I am will probably not attend any more tournament at the WotCGC I am tired of paying to parking and tournaments that run too long because of the noisy environment and rude people from other Tournaments.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Doug Taylor for doing a great job in spite of everything else.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who has reviewed my postings here on Decktech I think it really helped my decks and My Game.<br>
