<br>
Pretourny junk : After finally deciding to attend the SW<br>
National Championship, which i was not sure about, because<br>
i haven´t had a sanctioned SW tournament since the ´99<br>
Ralltiir Regional, i now have three weeks to find two decks,<br>
good enough to get me some wins.<br>
<br>
After talking to some Decktech members, who tell me not to<br>
worry about my rating, and play stuff i know, i turn to my<br>
friend Brian Hunter in advice for decks.<br>
Some days later, i have narrowed down my list to two decks<br>
each side : WYS or Hidden Mains for light, MKOS or Dark Deal<br>
for Dark. I come to the conclusion, not to play WYS, since<br>
i expect everyone to use it, and go with the HB Mains.<br>
For Dark i end up with Dark Deal, seeing that my MKOS, while<br>
very balanced, doesn´t as good as i hoped.<br>
<br>
So, after some playtesting, the day before the Nationals<br>
arrives.<br>
<br>
Friday, 04/06/01 (evening) : I hurry arround and scramble<br>
to get all my stuff together; get a hunch to include<br>
Battle Plan instead of Kal Fal, but ultimatively decide<br>
against it, because i am worried, that i won´t be able to<br>
hold it with four ships (editors note : had i decided for<br>
the Battle Plan, it would have helped in two games).<br>
<br>
But i decide on dumping Brangus for Xizor, which would<br>
wound up to have no effect at all on my deck (didn´t deploy<br>
Xizor all day).<br>
<br>
Saturday, 04/07/01 : I wake at four, get up at four thirty,<br>
and manage to goof arround till five. Then i get to the bus,<br>
which arrives shortly after.<br>
<br>
When i hit the next stop, where i am supposed to change bus<br>
to get to the train-station, i realize, i am short on time,<br>
because i will never make it in fifty minutes with a <br>
conventional bus plus riding the tub to get my train at<br>
6:21. So i get a cab - turns out to be a good decision;<br>
now i can atleast have some coffee to get awake.<br>
<br>
The trip itself - it takes approximately four hours to <br>
get to Bochum from Berlin (where i live) - is quite boring,<br>
so i will spare you the details.<br>
<br>
However, i am able to find the place, where the Natioals<br>
are going to be held, rather smoothly.<br>
I reintroduce myself to the TD, who for some odd reason <br>
seems to renember me from the ´99 Ralltiir Regional.<br>
<br>
I look arround, and see some new and some old faces; mainly<br>
Bastian Winkelhaus (2134) - one of the two top-guns, and<br>
as it turns out, Martin Falke (2099), eager to contest him<br>
for the title, is there as well - before the tourney starts.<br>
<br>
We have a good turnout - there are 53 people participating,<br>
including me ( i am the sole player from Berlin)<br>
<br>
-----End Pretourny Garbage---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Game 1 : Hidden Mains vs. Endor Ops<br>
<br>
I start Menace Fades, next to Insurrection,Staging Areas.<br>
<br>
The first few turns we just activate, i get out my docking<br>
bays, as well as Dagobah, the Hut and Corulag (as i would do<br>
every light game), then he deploys Rumors on Endor, drops<br>
the Visage with Baron and a scrub piloting.<br>
<br>
I get some guys at my docking bays to drain, and wait for<br>
Captain Han Solo, to go with one of my two Falcons in hand.<br>
<br>
I curse myself for not teching against the Bunker, cosz<br>
E-Man prevents me from deploying there and beating the @#$%<br>
out of him.<br>
<br>
Eventually, i get a full Superfalcon up and running, with <br>
Bacta Tank and OTE out. I cannot find my Punch It (as in<br>
every other light game i am about to play today), but since<br>
Kashyykk is the only system he has presence on, except<br>
Endor, i am not worried about the Rumors-drain, i can <br>
always retreat to Corulag to put Menace Fades into effect,<br>
should his stuff prove to be more than i can handle.<br>
<br>
He battles me at the aforementioned system, with the<br>
Accuser, some scrubs on board and the AO, but despite his<br>
immunity, i draw high enough to make him forfeit everything.<br>
<br>
But next turn he laterals my Falcon, brings another SD with<br>
crew (but still without Thrawn), Bossk in Bus and Dengar <br>
against my power-zero Falcon. <br>
I manage to kill Dengar and Bossk with my destinies, but in<br>
return have to forfeit Leia, who wanders in the Tank.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to get another beating and staying at his mery,<br>
i elect to retreat to the rendevous point, to cancel the<br>
lateral damage - but alas, he plays Gravity Shadow, and now<br>
my ship is stuck.<br>
<br>
He again battles me, after adding the Chimera to his mix,<br>
but draws relatively low, so i can just lose Chewie.<br>
His ships plus crew, however remain unscathed.<br>
<br>
Eventually, i manage to get to the Lateral Damage, and try<br>
to cancel it - 1. Then next two turns prove to be equally<br>
satisfying in that matter, as i draw a 2 and another 1.<br>
But now, the drains are hurting more and more, and i have<br>
to think of retrieval now, despite his SSPFT out.<br>
<br>
I edge Ben for five (to draw my tracked six), but mistrack,<br>
draw a 2 (kal fal) and murder Mr.Ben (actually quite <br>
humorous, as i would proceed to edge and kill Ben on another three times).<br>
<br>
We drain some more, but now, i have lost all my retrieval.<br>
I finally get Melas to the Endor Docking bay, only to have<br>
his drain blocked by Arica, who on the following turn <br>
breaks cover to battle her adversary. After the dust has<br>
settled, both the dancer and the alien are dead meat.<br>
<br>
In the end, with nothing else to show for (Home One and<br>
Spiral went to my lost pile soon)- i succumb to his drains.<br>
<br>
Full Loss (15).<br>
<br>
Game 2: Dark Deal vs. EBO<br>
<br>
Though he complains about having to lose to me in a drain<br>
race, i am equally worried, because EBO is one of the <br>
strongest Light Decks, and sets up much faster - still, <br>
i start Resistance as my third effect.<br>
<br>
He sets up usually, while i try to make something out of<br>
my crappy hand - i cannot find Search and Destroy, and he<br>
finally commits some Baragwins to his Hoth Locations, which<br>
lets me smile inwardly - Baragwin EBO is a deck i can beat.<br>
(I very much feared EBOX, because its cannons would keep<br>
me of my sector and prevent the deal).<br>
<br>
Well, he finally deploys two X-wings to his systems, so i<br>
now know what i am up against.<br>
<br>
Our drains are equal for some time, because Resistance is<br>
cutting in his potential to inflict harm on me.<br>
But then he gets TK to block Mara´s saber-enhanced drain<br>
at the Carbonite Chamber, while Boushh comes undercover to<br>
the Executor Dockingbay to pay Thrawn a visit.<br>
Seeing that i have no answer for the latter (Barrier), he<br>
breaks Leia´s cover and kills Thrawn.<br>
<br>
Cannot find Vader, nor can i find the Sniper to kill TK<br>
and reestablish my drain - his drains are now 4-1 in his<br>
favor. To make matters worse, Jedi Luke, armed with his<br>
fathers Lightsaber, comes down on Ardan and Janus at the<br>
West Gallery,but is not allowed to pass due to a Barrier,<br>
which gives my men a chance to run away.<br>
<br>
I finally manage to find my Sniper, and Mara kills Han with<br>
my tracked six plus a four (about the only time, my tracking skills worked as the should) -  he now has three<br>
x-wings at three different systems. I think of beating him<br>
down, but i only have Zuckuss and Executor in Hand, and <br>
HIS hand is always average eight cards, so without a ghhhk,<br>
i have nothing to answer a swarm of x-wings and the game<br>
could be over, if he deploys a cannon, power-pivots my<br>
Capital and shoots Zuckass. So i play defensively, even<br>
forego the deployment of my sector, because i only have<br>
one Tie in hand to go with the Zuckuss in ship - clearly<br>
not enough.<br>
<br>
The meager damage i do is covered by the Baragwin retrieval, so i look pretty stupid. Even moreso, when<br>
he edges Jedi Luke for six, giving me the loss by 34.<br>
<br>
Game 3 : Dark Deal vs. HB Strikeplan Mains <br>
<br>
This game nearly everything works out for me, as it should.<br>
I get a godlike setup - the Executor with three Admirals<br>
at the system, so i can drop the Occupation on turn five,<br>
i have Janus, the Emperor, Ardan and Bane Malar at my<br>
sites, plus Vader in hand. The two Obsidian Ties get to <br>
the sector, so i am ready to deploy the deal.<br>
<br>
He tries to contest me at the system - but without the<br>
Superfalcon, his ships are no match for three battle -<br>
destinies and average twenty power. So i slowly wipe him<br>
of the system, and drain him out. Win by 22.<br>
<br>
The curse is broken - finally, i have won with a dark deck!<br>
<br>
Game four : Hidden Mains vs. Oldskool Ties (PotF-Start)<br>
<br>
I know that this will be hard; normally, the advise is to<br>
stay away from them, so the cannot retrieve even more.<br>
<br>
But i have no I hope she is allright, no BattlePlan or<br>
Aim High, i know that my db-drains won´t cut it here; on <br>
top of that, i am unsure, whether i am able to initiate<br>
and maintain a retrieval loop with my edge-cards, something<br>
that would have saved me from the start.<br>
<br>
The first time i try to retrieve, i kill Ben again.<br>
<br>
I get the Falcon up, battle his lone Bossk in Bus and kill<br>
him for five overflow - get out Bacta Tank and Chewie on<br>
the Falcon for extra forfeit.<br>
<br>
After that, we have some skirmishes, the Falcon stands its<br>
ground, i manage to kil some ties. Eventually i wipe him<br>
of Kashyykk and have an uncontested drain for some turns,<br>
but then he comes at me with four Interceptors, a <br>
dreadnought, Dengar in Boat, plays All Power, which i <br>
couldn´t grab the first time arround, because i had no<br>
grabber then - his power is about 34 to my nine, and i draw<br>
low, so i have to lose Leia and Chewie while he is immune.<br>
<br>
He soon battles me another time, after i had run to Corulag, and the ensuing damage is so bad, that i have to<br>
lose Han, the Falcon, plus 11 more.<br>
<br>
From that on, i never seem to fully recover; i get off<br>
a suprise assault for eight, but he deploys some more ties,<br>
and retrieves with short-range fighters for twelve.<br>
<br>
(Btw, he played eighteen Tie Interceptors !)<br>
<br>
I drain some more, but he nails me in the end and i lose<br>
by 35, which is the largest i have lost a game to, ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am now 1-3, and i hope for another win to go 2-4; i know<br>
it is higly unlikely, i will make 3-3;which turns out to<br>
be right.<br>
<br>
Game 5: Hidden Mains vs. Random-space ground with Troopers.<br>
<br>
This game is rather easy. I pretty soon set up at the<br>
Tattoine and Cloud City DB, he deploys Mara (which i barrier), followed by some troopers, i deploy Chewie and<br>
Leia to Ben, play Order to Engage. He battles, Mara<br>
succumbs to Fallen Portal, and i clean everything but one<br>
trooper, who scurries away.<br>
<br>
I chase his other troopers plus a ATST again, get some <br>
more damage in, then he finally deploys to space -  <br>
for some reason, i don´t want to finsish him so quickly,<br>
so i wait before i deploy the Falcon, since i don´t have<br>
Leia or some other scrub to go with.<br>
<br>
Again i try to on the Edge Obi, AGAIN, i kill Obi, who -<br>
this turn gets tanked. I get him out, try again, only to<br>
kill him twice in one game - to add insult to injury, i<br>
mistrack for two off the edges.<br>
<br>
Bastian and some others, standing arround, make comments<br>
about my inability to track (and i feel rather foolish).<br>
<br>
In the end i drain him out, after a brief skirmish with<br>
Jedi Luke and some guys at the backdoor, which nets me<br>
another drain for three for several turns, and i drain him<br>
out. Full Win by 17.<br>
<br>
Game six : Dark Deal vs. RST - bunker blowup:<br>
<br>
I know whats coming my way, but i get a crappy opening hand, and i know, i can only win, if i play my own game.<br>
<br>
We take some times to setup, and after he moves into the<br>
bunker and plants a charge, which he misses the first <br>
draw on, i seriously consider, taking Vader and Sarkli to<br>
interfere with his plans, but i seem to detect a smile on<br>
my opponents face, telling me he can read my mind - great !<br>
<br>
I play my own game, set up with some characters, most<br>
notably the Emperor (Palpy got to see lots of action for<br>
his old wrinkled days), get the System out, with the<br>
Chimera and lots of scrubs aboard and the occupation going.<br>
(I did not deploy the executor, because it got grimtaashed<br>
 used an then lost to a drain). <br>
<br>
I further deploy the sector with a lone Tie, Barrier and<br>
Mastermove, Zuckuss in Ship, in Hand. I draw up Bossk in<br>
Hounds Tooth, after i deploy the Deal on the Sector.<br>
<br>
He comes down with the Superfalcon. I barrier. He <br>
follows up with Dash in Outrider and decides not to battle.<br>
I deploy Boskk in Bus, Guri as passenger and Zuckuss,<br>
battle, he has to lose the Outrider, Dash, and the Falcon,<br>
plus Han, but i lose Guri.<br>
<br>
He deploys Red Leader in Red 1 (no barrier this time),<br>
initiates, shoots Zuckuss and draws high, while i draw low,<br>
and lose Bossk. The X-Wing stays, to give me a nice drain<br>
of two for the rest of the game.<br>
<br>
I get some more scrubs on Bespin, maintain the drains plus<br>
an occupation for three, he tries to challenge me again<br>
at the system, but i beat him off - still, his drains are<br>
too much. Loss by 19.<br>
<br>
Woah, going 2-4, as predicted.<br>
<br>
Still, i didn´t make any gamebreaking mistakes, which is<br>
good. I didn´t even forget to force-drain, but once.<br>
(Did i tell you, i didn´t play in a sanctioned tournament<br>
 for about one and a half years ?)<br>
<br>
As expected, Bastian and Martin get to play each other in<br>
the Final Confrontation - with Martin winning with his <br>
Light by 19, but losing with his dark by 26.<br>
<br>
So, in the end, Bastian gets to be the champ.<br>
<br>
Hope you liked the report. <br>
