<br>
Ah let me see here this is my first posting on decktech so don&amp;#8217;t hold it against me if its bad cause writing isn&amp;#8217;t my strong skill. Well I live in NY state but I am in Seattle, WA until October so I&amp;#8217;ve been going to all the tournaments that I can to see how the people out here play compared to the people in NY play, Anyway enough of that. Okay the tourney starts at 12:00pm I&amp;#8217;ve been at the hospital with my brother until 11:00 am and I have to ride the bus out to Lake City to get to the tournament so I know I&amp;#8217;m going to be late but o&amp;#8217;well who the hell cares. Finally I arrive it&amp;#8217;s 12:20 I figure the director might let me and my brother play each other but he doesn&amp;#8217;t so we end you coming in with a 0(0) . Oh by the way I&amp;#8217;m playing a new school Rops deck (none of that AT-ST stuff) and a Profit deck that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the past couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
Game 1 or 2 depending on how you look at it.<br>
<br>
My LS vs. ???? Carbon Freezing Musicians<br>
<br>
	Well I didn&amp;#8217;t really know how this was going to turn out, I&amp;#8217;ve never actually played a musician deck in my life so I was kinda curious on how this one would turn out.  So the two aliens he starts out with two musicians (duh it&amp;#8217;s a musician deck and I can&amp;#8217;t remember who they were or what they do) and I give him Wedge to freeze. So first turn he pulls out a lot of cards out of his deck with his objective and with a musician and he also deploys a couple more characters to the Audience Chamber and I&amp;#8217;m thinking I&amp;#8217;m screwed cause he&amp;#8217;s got a lot of power cause he&amp;#8217;s got Umpass Stay. But luckily for me I&amp;#8217;ve got a kick ass hand with Master Luke, Ben Kenobi, and Anakin&amp;#8217;s and Obi&amp;#8217;s lightsaber and some other good cards. But decide to draw up and see what I get but it&amp;#8217;s nothing good so I decide to beat his ass next turn. Well he did what he did on his first turn pulls stuff with his musicians and objective and deploys Mara Jade to the Audience Chamber. Okay time to kick butt, I deploy Master Luke with Anakin&amp;#8217;s Saber for free and Ben Kenobi with his Saber and battle. I play Weapon Levitation and steal Mara&amp;#8217;s stick then he plays Weapon Levitation on Ben but I sense it. I try and return Umpass Stay to his hand but low and behold I draw a 1 he has nothing else to do so I try and cut Mara Well I miss her the first time but I get her the second time. For battle destiny I get a 6 (yeah) and he gets a 2 but he still has 6 more power then I do so I lose some crap out of my hand. Nothing much happens for the next few turns except for the fact that his musicians keep getting smaller and smaller in number. But he does drop ECC 4-Lom and blank Ben&amp;#8217;s game text so Luke ends you dying only to be replaced with EPP Luke. But finally I beat him off and flip getting 10 back from then on it&amp;#8217;s all down hill for him he&amp;#8217;s losing 6 force from my objective and drains and I&amp;#8217;m not getting drained at all he still hasn&amp;#8217;t froze Wedge yet so I decide to form a rescue party of Orr Marko, Boussh, and ECC Lando but they all die and Lando get captured he does freeze Wedge but it is to late I win by 26.<br>
2(+26)<br>
Highs: Winning my first game <br>
Lows: Not getting Wedge back and missing Umpass Stay<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
<br>
LS vs. ????&amp;#8217;s Tattooine Occupation with Skiffs<br>
<br>
Well I&amp;#8217;m not going to make this long normally I don&amp;#8217;t get pissed off and I&amp;#8217;m pretty easy going but this guy just pushed all my #$%^@!!!! Buttons. My hand sucked but I got stuff later on. But that&amp;#8217;s not what mad me mad, I swear to god this guy took 5 minute turns he had to read every card in his hand then think about it ARRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!! It wasn&amp;#8217;t that he was stalling it was just that he was very slow but I was getting frustrated. And I made a mistake that cost me the game he sense my The Force Is Strong With This one and I had Wise Advice out but I stupidly put it in my lost pile instead of my used pile. The game went to time and we both had 6 cards in our decks (that&amp;#8217;s were I would have won) but he had less in his lost pile so he won. TL 0(-0).<br>
2(+26)<br>
Highs: None<br>
Lows: The whole damn game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
DS vs. ????&amp;#8217;s Massassi Base Ops. <br>
<br>
Well this was the second time I&amp;#8217;ve ever played a Massiassi Ops deck and the first one I played my Rops deck tore it apart so I knew I had this one all wrapped up. The guy I was playing had been out of Star Wars for a while and he had been looking around at the decks that people were playing getting ideas. Any way I flipped my objective on the third turn cause I knew that he probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t play a lot of ground so I loosely defended my site and then I turned my attention to eliminating his space and ground forces. First he had a matching Special Edition pilot and ship at Yavin:4 so I deployed ZiM and ECC 4-Lom and battled I drew a 1 and a 3 plus three from my obj. so I cleared the site and then some. He tried to fight me off but it hurt him even more, I deployed more and more BH ships so he gave up on ever taking back space. At this point he knew it was a lost cause but he still fought all the way which is the type of game I liked to  play. I played two biker scouts with bikes and EPP Fett and Mara with lightsaber to Yavin4: docking bay and began clearing all of his sites. Farm Boy Luke reared his head once striking down Mara but that was the final death spasm he didn&amp;#8217;t draw out I drained him out . In the end as the dust settled he had no characters or effects on the table the only cards that remained of his (besides his starting stuff) was Yavin4, and LS Death Star. FW 2(+33).<br>
4(+59)<br>
Highs: It was a good game the kind I like to play<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
Game5<br>
DS vs. (the guy I played in game three)&amp;#8217;s Hidden Base<br>
<br>
Alright dammit  I&amp;#8217;m gonna win against this guy I mean come on my Rops tears apart EBO decks why not HB decks. But unfortunately I suck at guessing the planet. Once again I&amp;#8217;m gonna keep this one short and sweet. My default starter finally pays off  , Security Precautions I love you. I actually bother to read the rest of the card I know I can&amp;#8217;t lose. The other guy knows it to cause he doesn&amp;#8217;t flip his obj. until later in the game cause he thought he could get by draining me for one and planets. So it&amp;#8217;s a big drain race but I'm winning cause I&amp;#8217;ve got this cool combo in my deck where I play Expand The Empire at Spaceport City and then play a Imperial Commander and hit him for 6-8 drain a turn but would  every once and a while he would cancel a drain with It&amp;#8217;s a Hit. Finally he flips his obj. and hits me with 6 drain a turn, so by now I&amp;#8217;ve only managed to get two starships in my hand cause I never got to flip my objective so I got to make my babies count. I&amp;#8217;ve got my eye on two planets Bespin and Endor cause they are the only two he doesn&amp;#8217;t have a hoard of ships next to so I decide to go with Endor first, nope damn one my ship. Bespin pays off big time I find his hidden base a kill his obj. and he has to lose 7 force because of Security Precautions Haha . He wants to retrieve 12 force with all wings report in but I remind him that he has to pay for it because of Secret Plans. But he doesn&amp;#8217;t have 12 force left so sad for him. I star to get more ships and go on the offensive and I drain him out. Boo ya! sweet sweet revenge he still took 5 minute turns but I still kicked his ass. FW 2(+7)<br>
6(+66)<br>
Highs: Beating the slow poke, you should seen the look on his face.<br>
Lows: None really I kicked his ass <br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
LS vs. Keith Watabyashi&amp;#8217;s ISB imperial<br>
<br>
The only guy whose name I know or bothered to write down. I only played him once before at the regional and he beat me with his Throne room mains so I was out for revenge. My opening hand kinda sucks but Keith says his does to so we spend the first three turns drawing up and saving force. I&amp;#8217;ve gotten Ben, Master Luke with both their sabers Orramarko  and some other good cards. I play Artoo at the Palace and build up force for the next few turns. The Keith plays a Dune Walker, Blizzard 2 with a couple of ISB agents and flips his obj. He tries to Trample Artoo but draws Ozzel for so he missed haha. I play Orramarko, Master Luke with his saber and Ben Kenobi and battle. He draws a 1 I draw a 6 hehe I win the battle so he has to lose 2 force because Orramarko and a couple of ISB agents so I lose a regenerate Orramarko. Next turn he plays DVDLOTS and some more ISB agents and battles so I play fallen portal and crush 2 ISB agents and then I play The Force Is Strong With This One, Vader gets cut and Artoo gets choked. For destiny I get a 4,5,and 6 so I clear the site and win the battle so he has to lose two force cause of Orramarko.  I play Draw Their Fire and He plays First Strike. I decide to retrieve my 10 force so I flip my Obj and I have to pay for it all because of Secret Plans. We have a couple battles but we are both picking down each others life force It&amp;#8217;s almost the end it could still go either way but he deploys Vedson to Tatooine: Jabba's Palace where I had ECC Lando. Now from what I could figure he was going to battle Lando and retrieve 2 force because of Draw Their Fire and First Strike then he thought I was going to play Fallen Portal so Vedson would die and then he would retrieve him but by was he wrong. I had a Run Luke Run! So Master Luke ran over to the battle being a amazing power 8 plus Lando&amp;#8217;s power three, so Lando shoots Vedson and hits him and I draw a 5 for destiny so my total power was 16 to his 2. So that&amp;#8217;s game FW 2(+10)<br>
8(+76)<br>
Highs: Getting kick ass destiny draws and Slaughtering Vedson<br>
Lows: None it was a kick ass game<br>
<br>
In the end I ended getting 5th I would have gotten 3rd but I was beat out by differential cause the guy that got 3rd was 8(+82)I think, but I bet If I had gotten there on time I would have gotten 3rd but I ended up starting out with that 0(0), o well there is always next time. But I ended up getting   2 packs of CC and two vouchers for 4 packs of Death Star 2 when it came out. Thanks for taking the time for to read my first report.<br>
