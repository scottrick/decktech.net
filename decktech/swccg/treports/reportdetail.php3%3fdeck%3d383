My DS was a Raltiir Ops deck, no need to describe it farther :-)<br>
<br>
So after a 4 hour car ride, i get to the tournament and play a couple games just for fun, i listen to some kid brag about how unbeatable his ECC Objective Dark deck was and try not to laugh while waiting for the tournament to start.<br>
<br>
Game 1, LS vs Dean Richmond <br>
<br>
Dean starts out with ISB/Coruscant + No Bargin, i go for the usual stuff, i drop both nudjes first turn and a 2-0 site and draw a tunnle vision.  second turn I tunnle for a revo and play it on his Coruscant and draw another tunnle vision, while he deploys Kessel and Kashyyyk.  My third turn I tunnle vision for a signal, signal for a revo and play it on Kessel, and draw another revo.  so my next turn i revo his kashyyyk and he's really jumping for force.  He saves enough force for a couple random BH ships but by this point i had tantive, GLinG1 and Lando in Falcon sitting at Kashyyyk with a pilot on GLinG1 and Lando, so I don't worry too much and keep battling him to get rid of his ships.  I get out Obi's Hut and drop Obi+saber and master luke + saber, so i'm draining at kashyyyk and obi's hut, he deploys a undercover ORS at obi's hut so i drop the audience chamber and he doesn't have force to follow me around, and I drain him out eventurally.  win by 15, 2 +15<br>
<br>
Game 2, DS vs. Ted P. <br>
<br>
Ted starts Obi's Hut + Audience Chamber while i chose Bad Feeling Have I as my starting effect.  before the tournament, ted made the promise/threat that he'll take off one article of clothing for each game he loses, so i wasn't sure if I should totally beat him down, throw the game, or run far far away from him.... i decide to beat him down and hope he had enough articles of clothing on him....   I start getting my non-unique sites out and drops a twix site.  on the third turn i had about 10 force but still couldn't draw a chicken walker, so i decided to flip without the walkers.  I drop Evax at a site, and an ATST pilot at the other two sites, drop ozzel with evax and move the atst pilots together.  Ted now has Obi at Audience Chamber but doesn't really have any other characters, but he did alter Bad Feeling Have I.  the first thing i pulled with Raltiir Ops was IAO so he couldn't surprise me, and I drop Iggy with gun along side my ATST pilots.  I finally draw a couple of chicken walkers so now my guys on raltiir was protected.  I lose CHYBC off the top to one of the drains so Ted nabruns Obi Luke Han to my Coruscant Imperial Square, but I get out a couple of ships and satisfy Imp. Decree the next turn so he is still only draining me for one and i soon drain him out, win by 15, 4 +30<br>
<br>
Game 3, DS vs. Nathan Brown<br>
<br>
Nathan starts MWYHL so i grab Bad Feeling again, interestingly enough he didn't deploy a character all game.  I get Kashyyyk in my opening hand so i put it out and a non-unique site.  he pulls yoda's hut out, drops a couple of x-wings at Kashyyyk and moves them over to Raltiir.  I soon control 3 raltiir sites, and decide to drop Bubble boy at raltiir to flip my objective.  but i was stupid and didn't see that he had a force active, so he barriers me and I'm like Oh Shit and I send Evax up with the ship to cushion some damage.  at the end of my turn he organized attacks to get out some x-wings and he drops like 6 x-wings on his turn, and with S-foils on he battles me and I lose 19 and everything.  I'm still hoping i can pull this game out because he's draining me for 0 and I'm draining him for 4 total on raltiir.  but he drops Coruscant and I'm searching madly for my copy to convert it.  I do convert it eventurally but he also gets out Kessel and Kiffex and could still drain at my kashyyyk, i get out Vader's Shuttle with a pilot late and start bugging him where he has only a couple of x-wings, just basically running away every turn but staying at a battleground system so i satisfied Battle Order while he didn't, but it was too late. lose by 13, 4 + 17<br>
<br>
game 4, LS vs. Jon Saunders<br>
<br>
Jon starts court/No bargin.  I get my nudjs out the first couple of turns and gets obi Chilling out at the Audience Chamber, which i converted.  He gets no sites so he is only activating 4 a turn and having a hard time getting anything going.  soon obi is backed up by twass khaa and Melas and Luke, and he is losing a force every turn to his own mini-visage.  he eventurally deploys Zuckuss at his Sarlaac pit, but he is activating so little that he can't afford to save two force to make it even look like he has a oota-goota solo, so i nabrun my guys over and beat the snot out of zuckuss and keep draining.  eventurally he deploys Scum at the audience chamber and drops fett + Jodo kast, but again i nabrun over, had Obi Luke Han along with a couple other random guys, He hidden weapons and captures luke with jodo kast while losing Fett, flipping his objective.  meanwhile I convert EPP Obi with Ben + saber so i'm not losing anybody from the battles.  He moves Jodo Kast over to the dungeon and deposits him.  so on my turn i nabrun again to  the dungeon (he's real tired of nabrun by now, thats what you get for not playing IAO) and beat the snot out of Jodo Kast for some damage, but i didn't have the 3 force needed to get Luke out. on his turn he drops 4-lom with gun, picks up Luke and moves over to the audience Chamber.  I follow him with all my guys to the audience chamber, and by now I have Boushh with anakin's LS so i'm draining for 3 every turn.  On his turn he finally deploys rancor and trap doors Luke and eats him, but I don't mind too much 'cause I had a fat hand and nothing to do with it.  his objective flips back, and I deploy my Jabba's Palace, making him lose a couple force, and move all my guys over to there.  he doesn't have enough activation/remaining life force to do anything and I drain him out, win by 18.  6 + 35<br>
<br>
Game 5, DS vs. Patrick Ziagos<br>
<br>
He starts Obi's Hut + Lar's Moisture Farm, so I'm thinking Harvest and start Oppressive Enforcement.  I get 3 twix sites in opening hand and an raltiir site, so i put those out and fish another one out from my reserve.  His first turn he drops Obi + saber and moves them over to Lars Moisture farm.  my second turn I pull out my third site and draw a little until I have enough to flip, but his turn he deploys Tantive and Melas and Wedge.  I deploy some guys and walkers to occupy my raltiir sites, but have to wait a turn to beat him off the system. next turn I drop Bubble boy, flip and battles, but he just loses wedge to the bacta tank.  next turn he deploys wedge back down and battles, i lose a force while wedge goes back to the tank.  I get out IAO and makes sure he can't nabrun over and surprise me, and also get down tarkin on a walker and successfully alter the bacta tank, he tries to sense but I alter the sense.  I battle again with Bubble boy and finally beats him off of raltiir.  He gets out Artoo and C-3P0 at the moisture farm and starts playing HDWGITM, and I couldn't stop because i didn't have any grabbers in hand. He starts Out of Commisioning everything I had in my lost pile but at this point it didn't matter because i didn't have any duplicate uniques in there.  He also gets out LS Prof. on Obi and gets out EPP Luke along side him.  I get out Imp Decree and drops Devastator + pilot at Coruscant to satisfy it along with my ship at Raltiir.  so he didn't have any drains and deploys Cantina and moves all of his guys over there, while I am content solidifying raltiir and sitting on a drain of 4 a turn.  Finally he starts getting some drains in cantina, and I lose Vader off the top of my reserve, at this point i had a total of 3 force including vader in my lost pile.  He deploys Order to Engage and nabruns everyone in his move phase over to my Docking Bay on Raltiir.  I'm very confident because I had Vader + saber, you are beaten, 4-lom in hand and tarkin at the site.  the only problem is if he out of comissions Vader before i could deploy him.  Patrick uses his last force on his turn to HDWGITM to try to find some out of commssions.  He tries to just play 3 OOCs and get rid of everything in my lost pile, but I say no no and grab the first one, so he had no force to play the other ones.  He says okay and i shuffle my lost pile for him to pick one and luckyly for him he manages to pick vader.  so i decide not to fight him and moves away from him, losing from my hand Vader, Vader's saber, and You are beaten (not too hard to decide).  He moves everyone over to the next site, but this time I'm ready and alters his Order to Engage and run away without having to lose force.  meanwhile I get out a walker with ozzel at his obi's hut.  He realizes he can't stay on raltiir so he deploys Owen, beru at the moisture farm nabruns everyone back to the farm and moves obi and some other guy over to stop my drain at the Hut, and starts playing Harvest.  I can't stop it because I can't find the last grabber for the life of me.  so i decided to deploy iggy and 4lom to the farm to capture owen or Beru so the harvests stop, but i get hit with the stupid bug again and mistaken mara in my hand for Iggy and deploy her and 4-lom.  I definitly didn't want to battle with mara and 4-lom so i move mara to the audience chamber, and moves my walker with ozzel to Mos Eisley to avoid beatdown.  He moves obi + company to Moseisly and does some more harvests.  but I deploy Iggy to the farm, move mara and ozzel on walker over.  now his draining for one at his cantina, but he can't move away from the farm or else he can't harvest.  so he battles and plays harvest as a destiny adder, I get Iggy to capture Beru and pulls some bad destiny and he doesn't have to lose much.  I decide to lose both mara and the walker so that i had no one for him to battle, and keeps Iggy and 4-lom but moves them to another site.  with Beru captured, he had no choice but to harvest for one and bring back a Sorry about the Mess, by this time I finally drew the grabber and grabs the harvest, I keep running my guys away from his characters with weapons so that he couldn't free beru and he had a drain of 1 to my drain of 4, i win by 7.  8 +42<br>
<br>
Game 6, LS vs. Eric Slawko<br>
<br>
Eric start Hunt down no duel and Crush the rebellion.  I get a revo and grabber in my hand, but no locations.  I deploy both nudjs my first turn and draws a twix site and a Transm. Term. to kill his visage.  my second turn i drop the site and draws some more.  the drops yavin 4 docking bay(!?) and vader, along with IAO.  He moves vader to my farm.  On my turn I revo his mediation chamber and save force.  He drains me and deploys the Back Door, my turn I activate and drop Luke Han and Chewie with vader, and Obi at the Back Door to flip hunt down back, and battle vader, he plays I Have You Now, while I miss with my lightsaber.  I play The Force... and Don't Get Cocky, but his destiny is pretty good so he only has to lose like 7 force besides vader.  He finally decide to evader, so I grab it.  His turn he deploys Vader + kit kat, and battle obi, and plays I have you now again.  my destiny was a 0 so i lose obi and 10 more.  the game was going really fast.  I now revo both his executor sites, and gets out Boushh undercover with vader.  I deploy Melas + Jeron webb ath his 3rd marker to try to get some more drains, but he deploys Tempest 1 and blizzard 2, and i lose both guys and some force, meanwhile he deploys Endor too.  I drop Master Luke with Vader, give him his stick and breaks leia's cover, I battle, bounce Kit Kat back to his hand, but misses vader again with a slash, I play Skywalkers but my destiny wasn't great and his was decent to so he loses vader and only a few more force.  He deploys BIHT to Endor and Battle Plans.  I use wedge to check for a corellian slip and see a 6 in my reserve, but I'm not sure if I should go after BIHT in space or the Walkers on Ground.  I probably made the wrong decision and went after the walkers with Obi and Harc seff, I lose Harc to attrition and he loses one of the walkers, but next turn deploys tarkin on board and beats Obi, and now I didn't have enough force to deploy Lando In Falcon to Endor, so I try to do as much damage as possible before finally losing to the drains, lose by 23.  8 +19<br>
<br>
so I go a disappointing 4-2, and I don't think i finished top 8 due to  my low diff.  but it was okay 'cause i met some interesting people, including Ted P. who, luckyly, didn't have to take anything other than his shoes off. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=383"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=383"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
