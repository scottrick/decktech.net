Well, it&#146;s been 1.5 months since I have been to a tourney, but have been play-testing every Thursday with Stephen at T &amp; T&#146;s. So, I decide that my apprentice, Joel, needs to have tourney experience, so I choose this last weekend, before I go off to college, as my last tourney for the summer. I happened to talk to Dan [SithLord05] on Monday, and he said he would come along too, as he was in the vicinity. I am now officially the founder of Team Bomb Squad, and Joel and Daniel are 2 members. My soon-to-be-roomie, Jay, will soon become #4, completing the set. Anyhoo, I sleep over at Joel&#146;s house Friday night [Not really, we were refinishing his DS deck, trying to water it down so he would find it easier to play.] Anyway, Dan met up with us, and we got to GQ at about 11.15, and set up the tables, while the rest of the people sat there trading [You KNOW who YOU are&amp;#8230;].<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are 16 people there, and 4 drop out later on, and end up in the middle of the block, with their scores.<br>
<br>
My Decks.<br>
DS: Endor Ops: I was pleased with my deck&#146;s performance at the last tourney, so I just added a little more space, to make sure I could hold Endor without a doubt. By the way, my destiny average is a 3.7, playing only 3 1&#146;s. I start Prepared Defenses, playing Battle Order [BO] [hehehe], Imperial Arrest Order [IAO], and Combat Response [CR].<br>
<br>
LS: RST w/racing: I know, it sounds like I copied, but I didn&#146;t. All my decks are completely original. I have a completely original deck, and I think it can hold it&#146;s own, as long as I keep getting characters. Its average destiny is a 3.2, so my draws are insane. I usually win the race by turn 4. I race only for one reason. If the other races, I can put up a challenge. If the other doesn&#146;t, I win. I start The Shield Is Down, and don&#146;t play Strike Planning. I know it sounds suicidal, but I don&#146;t need too many effects.<br>
<br>
And now [Drum-roll, please] <br>
<br>
Clang-crash-bang-snap-pop&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; I said drum roll, not drum throw. The things I have to put up with nowadays&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
By the way, my rating going into the tournament is 1506; I&#146;m aiming to improve it by at least 20, by going 4-2 today.<br>
<br>
Game 1. My LS v/s Rebekah Gruver&#146;s [1346] RalOps<br>
<br>
At the start of the game she looks hard at my objective, and says she has never played against this deck before. I was shocked! I told her I would show her how the deck was played, and gave a sinister laugh. Looking back at the game, I felt bad trying to scare her. But I was being my usual self, and she knew how that was. We started racing, and she deployed the Forest and Spaceport Docking Bay to Ralltiir, and draws up. My turn, I deploy Bunker, Back Door, pull I Did It!, and Throw Me Another Charge [TMAC] for an Explosive Charge. Those things are awesome! I have Luke, Crix and Blount in hand, but I hold off a turn, and draw an Explosive Charge [That&#146;s 2]. We race. She deploys Darth Vader and Dr. E + Ponda combo, and gives Vader his stick. All this at the spaceport docking bay. She deploys Sandwhirl on the Desert she had also deployed to Ralltiir. I wondered why, but never mind. My turn, I pull Deactivate The Shield Generator [DTSG], deploy it on Bunker, along with Blount, Luke, Luke&#146;s LS, and Crix to Rebel Landing Site, pull Junkin, deploy him to Bunker. TMAC for a 3rd Explosive Charge, deploy all 3 to Bunker, move Crix and Luke to the Back Door. We race. At this point I have 23, she has none, as she chose not to race. She drained some, and drew, and exclaimed with glee. She had a hand of about 19 cards, and was grinning maniacally. I felt sorry for her at this point. I drained 1 at Bunker, blew the Bunker, retrieved my whole lost pile, and asked her to drop her hand to her used pile. She said &quot;WHAT??!! No way!&quot; I showed her The Shield Is Down [TSID]. Reluctantly, she did so, and lost 8 force. I flipped, and drained for 3 at Back Door. I had COK and DOS in hand, and a couple of scouts as well. I have about 20 force saved. For 3, I Squassin DS2 Wedge for RS1. Deploy to Endor for 3, and say go. I win the Podrace. She drains for 2, and draws, as she has no hand whatsoever. I retrieve my stuff, she loses 6. 14 force loss almost instantaneously. Oh well. I activate all I can. That&#146;s 13. I have 30 force saved. I drain 4, and deploy DOS, COK with Bowcaster, Beezer, and Cracken [pulled using Crix] to Vader&#146;s site, for a total of 29. Since I don&#146;t have a stick for Leia in hand, Luke gets Lightsaber Proficiency. I have exactly 1 force to battle. I initiate, she has no actions. I play I Know, but Han&#146;s not there [I should have looked closer, or played Armed and Dangerous first.] I Armed And Dangerous [AAD] for DOS&#146;s stick. COK hits Vader, Vader chops COK, DOS kills Dr. E + Ponda. She forgets to operate, and I think &quot;sweet&quot;. I Insertion Planning her 3 to zero, and draw a 6. My power = 21. Hers is 13. I forgot that E + P are power -3 when present with a glowing rod. Both her guys are forfeit = 0, as is COK. She has to lose 9 more, and I lose Chewie, to retrieve him back that very turn. She has no retrieval, so Vader stays gone. She deploys The Emperor&#146;s Sword and a non-unique TIE interceptor. SFS was on Wakeelmui, so she retrieved 4. She initiates battle, plays All Power To Weapons. OUCH! Power 18 + 4 for destiny. I have 6 + 6 = 12 to 22. Wedge and ship cover it all, and so it wasn&#146;t that bad, but she had another drain location now. I drained 6, and deployed Home One to Endor and initiated battle. She has another All Power to Weapons [surprise]. Her total was about 20, mine was 13. Home One bit the dust. At least I tried. She drained one, and drew one. Next turn, I drained her out, winning by 23.<br>
FW: 2, +23<br>
Total: 2, +23<br>
Highs: My LS deck might not be a POS like my last one. I see potential. Beating up on Vader like that. Ouch.<br>
Lows: Wedge getting the snot beaten out of him. Also, beating up Rebekah so badly. She&#146;s a good player, but has bad luck at tournaments.<br>
<br>
Game 2. My DS v/s Chris Simmons [1703] TIGIH with racing.<br>
Now this is the worst match-up for an Endor Ops deck. I cannot deploy Ominous Rumors [OR] the first turn as I always do. By the way, he did something really cool. His starting effect was Lightsaber Proficiency deployed on Luke. In my turn, I deployed Turr in Saber 2 to Endor, and deployed the Dark Forest. SO his first turn, he drains for 2 at Luke&#146;s location. How annoying is that? He deploys Tawss Khwaa to my dark forest, and moves Luke over. At this point, both of us make a crucial mistake. I deployed Barich, Avarik, and Misik, with 2 bikes to Luke and Tawss. We forgot that Luke gets captured. He deploys KFC there on his turn, and initiates. He chops one, and the battle was fairly close. KFC goes to the tank he deployed, and Tawss eats the rest. THEN he tells me to capture Luke. I was so pissed. But anyway, he deploys more and more to Endor, including Obi-wan Kenobi, and another Tawss Khwaa.  KFC comes back from the tank to join them. A lot of battles take place, with him retrieving from my First Strike, but the battles were pretty even. The constant damage of 2 hurt me a lot. Then, he won the race, and deployed I Did It! So I cant save up force to react any more, so I lose 2 to save my force. At this point I&#146;m either losing 2 force and hardly draining, or I&#146;m losing 4 force, and draining a little more. Eventually, the direct damage beat me down. <br>
FL &amp;#8211;23 [Funny, isn&#146;t it?]<br>
Total: 2, +0<br>
Highs: Killing a lot of his guys, who came back again and again.<br>
Lows: Him forgetting to hand over Luke, which would have changed things. Oh well.<br>
<br>
So I&#146;m back to square 1 [or 0]. And at this point, I&#146;m 1-1, so I can still make my target of 4-2. <br>
<br>
Game 3: My LS v/s Steven Morgan&#146;s [1631] SYCFA non-flip racing.<br>
Right now, I want to win big to get a good differential. Since we were both racing, he starts by frying my pod. I respond by playing a Losing Track on him, and make him lose to stack his destinies, which are insanely high, and for some reason, I never get a hold of my really high destinies until it was too late. He started Watto&#146;s Box, so I lost 11 for the race. But that was not the turning point of the game. A turn before Sebulba found the checkered flag; I had Cracken, COK, and Dash at the Bunker with 3 Explosive Charges. I couldn&#146;t draw any other characters for the life of me. On his turn, he Set For Stuns Chewie back into my hand, deploys Vader w/stick, Dr. E + PB, Iggy w/gun, and Mara to my site. He initiates battle against Cracken and Dash. He shoots Cracken to the used pile with Iggy, and plays a Jabba&#146;s Through With You. He gets 2 destinies against a lone Dash [I didn&#146;t find the Outrider the previous turn]. His total is 28, to my 3. I have to lose 25! Dash takes 5, there goes my hand and all but 2 of my characters. So I pretty much lost the game then. But as a revenge factor, I got to clear out the Bunker with those Explosive Charges. I had 3 destinies, and 1 of them had to be over a 4. The first 2 were 4&#146;s. My third was a Jedi Luke. Each card at the Bunker, except the Bunker, went bye-bye. That also meant my Epic Event, DTSG. So, when I lost the Podrace, which was the end of the game there. I drew up the 7 cards left, as I had nothing I could do, as I had no cards with ability on the table.<br>
FL -25<br>
Score: 2, -25.<br>
Highs: Killing all those characters because I lost a battle. Revenge is so sweet.<br>
Lows: 25 battle damage! Where&#146;s a Houjix when you need it, huh? Not in your deck, that&#146;s where.<br>
<br>
Now I&#146;m, at 1-2, and I HAVE to win the next 3 games, or I would be severely disappointed by myself.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My DS [muhahaha] v/s Ryan Melton&#146;s [1500] EBO.<br>
This is Ryan&#146;s first tournament, and I decided not to hurt him too much. You have to keep the newbies interested, and not totally blow them away so they quit. So, instead of flipping immediately, I deployed Barich and Misik with bikes to the 4th marker, and Saber 1 with Fel to the Endor system, with OR there. All this over a course of 2 turns. I also get Battle Deployment out, which is sweet! He deployed Elhek Rhue in Red 7 and Tycho Celchu in GS3 to the Echo DB, which he pulled, using A New Secret Base, or Echo Base Garrison [I forget]. Any way, he moves Tycho into the med lab. I move Barich on bike over to the DB, and Misik on bike to the Generators. I was also draining him a good amount at this time. I deploy a few more bikes and pilots to Endor to flip, so my drains on Endor are now uncontested. I draw up, getting Onyx 1, and Major Mianda. And then he screws up. He deploys Wedge to a third Echo site, deploying EBO. He also deploys Kiffex and Coruscant. He has been drawing a lot for the last couple of turns. Anyway, I drain him 10, deploy Jendon and Onyx 1 using CR, to Kiffex, and Mianda in Scythe 1 from hand to Coruscant with 7.2 cannons from the DS2 set. Jendon gets the 9.3 cannons. I initiate battle against Rhue in Red 7 at the DB. Neither gets a battle destiny, but I play High Speed Tactics to draw a 6. So the pilot and his ship go away, with Barich standing [sitting] triumphant on his bike. The next turn, he draws again, cursing when he doesn&#146;t find what he is looking for. I drain him 1 at the Endor DB, 2 at Dark Forest, 2 at the Backdoor, 5 at Endor, 1 at the Echo DB, 1 at the generators, 4 at Kiffex, and 3 at Coruscant. That*s a drain of 19; he loses his hand and 1 card of the top, Hoth. That was the card he was looking for. He draws up the next turn, allowing me to drain him for 19 again. That was game right there. This game ended in 32 minutes.<br>
FW +15<br>
Score: 4, -10<br>
Highs: My DS deck finally working like it is supposed to. Also, winning.<br>
Lows: Beating him badly. I did give him tips on how to beat a deck like mine, and some other pointers on what to do.<br>
<br>
At this point, I&#146;m 2-2, and might still be able to make a 4-2.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My DS v/s Luke Heerman&#146;s [1508] Profit w/ racing. <br>
Man, another racing deck. Oh well. I look at my hand. This was a god hand. Back Door, Forest Clearing, Elsek, Drelosyn, Irol, Tempest Scout 6, Fel, TIE 9.2 cannons. He is giving me 3 force, plus my own 4. I start with 8. I deploy OR from deck, Fel in ship with cannons, and draw 2. ESB and Battle Deployment. He deploys Obi w/stick to free Han, and flips, giving me damage of 2, which I lose off the top. All Power to Weapons and a High Speed Tactics. He does nothing else but draw. My turn, I grin, activating my force. I don&#146;t drain as BO was on table and I needed the force. I deploy my 2 sites, drop a biker to each site, deploy ESB and flip. I deploy Battle Deployment [BD] and a bike from reserve to Irol. I draw up one, getting Misik. Next turn, again, he drains and draws. Fine by me. I drain him for 10, surprising him. I deploy another bike to Endor from reserve, giving it to Drelosyn. I draw 5, getting another HST, Accelerate, All Power To Weapons, a bike and Turr Phenir. His turn, he drains, deploys Protector, Owen + Beru combo, and Tawss Khwaa to lone Elsek. He initiates, I react, Irol and Drelosyn riding over on their respective bikes. He cancels Drelosyn&#146;s gametext using Protector. I play HST on Irol, my power is 11, + 2 destinies. He has 12, with one destiny. I draw a 6 and a 5 [which becomes a 7 because of Irol]. He draws a one. I clear the site, losing only Elsek from my side. My turn, I drain 4, deploy Misik to the Back Door, giving him a bike from reserve. I have about 6 bikes, so I usually find one in my deck. I move Drelosyn to the Forest, and retrieve Elsek during my draw phase. He drains some, I lose bikers, and retrieve them back. I drain 10; he has no retrieval since I killed the harvesters. He never fully utilized the flip side of profit, and so I beat him out in the drain race.<br>
FW +12.<br>
Score: 6, +2.<br>
Highs: Beating the snot out of Protector and crew. Winning again.<br>
Lows: I drew up too many towards the end. I need a Reactor Terminal in this deck.<br>
<br>
Now I&#146;m 3-2, and I HAVE to win the next game. <br>
<br>
Game 6: My LS v/s Tyler Pate&#146;s [1591] RalOps<br>
Tyler told me he was 2-3 today, and had to win the next game. I told him he wouldn&#146;t, as I had already beaten a RalOps today. Well, this was the best game I played today, so read carefully. His first turn, he deploys his sites, and a Sleen to one of them, canceling my icon. He draws up and grins. I deploy the bunker and back door from reserve deck, and draw up a few characters, including Orrimarrko. He deploys, on his turn, another diamond site to Ralltiir, a Sleen there, the Tatooine DB, and Darth Maul to the Bunker. Oh @#$%. This screwed my plans, as Cracken could deploy there, but I would have no presence. So I deploy COK, Cracken, Orrimarrko and Kensaric to the Landing Site, and move in. His turn, he deploys Vader to the Bunker, but does NOT initiate battle. This messed him up completely. I won the race on that turn, so his move phase, he lost his 6, I got nothing [I had nothing]. My next turn, I deploy 3 Explosive Charges and Junkin to the bunker, and initiate battle. I Armed And Dangerous for COK&#146;s Bowcaster, and shoot Vader. We both draw a battle destiny. He*s immune. I lose Kensaric to cover my losses, and he loses Vader. His turn, he deploys Fett w/gun and a Comm. Chief to the Tat: DB. He deploys a Sith Probe Droid to the Rebel Landing Site, retrieving Vader, and moves Maul to the Landing site. That was the worst thing he could have done. I blew the bunker, sending his hand to the used pile, and making him lose 8. I got all my cards back. Then, I deploy Crix to the Tat: DB, and pull out Beezer and deploy her to his site. I initiate battle, and he misses Beezer with Fett. I insertion planning his 3 to a zero, and draw a 3 for destiny. He loses the Comm. Chief. I draw Leia, Ani&#146;s stick, and LS Proficiency. I look at his lone Reserve pilot [What gives? Oh, it&#146;s a non-unique imperial. That&#146;s why.], and smile. His turn, he draws up. He forgot to move Fett. Oh well. I deploy Leia w/stick and proficiency to the pilot at the spaceport DB, initiate, play I Know, pull Han and gun and deploy them there. I chop him up. My 14 to his 1. Ouch! He loses all of it from reserve deck, as the pilot was forfeit = 0. Then I initiate against Fett, fearing a Res Luk Rauuf. He shot Beezer. I drew a 5. My 10 to his 4, he loss Fett and 1 more, and drew up in his turn. <br>
FW +26.<br>
Score: 8, +28<br>
Highs: Beating up both the Sith Lords, Fett and the lone pilot.<br>
Lows: None as such. I forgot to place Boonta Eve out of play to retrieve 4. Oh well. <br>
<br>
Final score: 8, +28. I won 4 games. YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I&#146;m happy. Mission Accomplished.<br>

To me, for finishing all my games in less than 40 minutes, I had to wait around so much.<br>
<br>
Well, I go off to GA Tech in a week, and will not be playing to many tournaments now. But I will still be around.<br>
