Never make decks while you are drunk.  I live in Tennessee and its really boring here but there are three things we&#146;re pretty good at; drinking(lots of drunk people), Star Wars Cards(Hays, Lewis,  Chu and Gordon) and Bankruptcy (no. 1 in the nation).  Saturday night I decide to combine the first two and gulp down wine while building new decks for the tournament tomorrow.  I finish and head over to a keg party.  <br>
<br>
I wake up the next morning grab my decks and head over to the cafeteria with my roommate Joseph Hennessey and another of my friends John Camp.  We eat a craptacular breakfast and head down to the KGB.  I walk in the shop and there is no air conditioner and only 9 people there for the Star Wars Tournament.  Kinda sucks but at least we started under an hour late.  My rating before the tournament is 1723.<br>
<br>
Pairings are called and I have to play John Camp.  John&#146;s  playing Hunt Down with a bunch of really high destinies and dueling crap.  I&#146;ve always had problems with Hunt Down but I beat John about 50% of the time so I have some hope.  I start shuffling my cards and that is when I notice drunken mistake number one.  My Cloud City docking bay is a dark side card.  I waste about fifteen minutes of mine and John&#146;s game time looking for a docking bay and don&#146;t find one so I just stick in the Cantina instead.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
My Hidden Base Mains vs. John Camp&#146;s (1609) Hunt Down<br>
<br>
John activates and drops Bad Feeling Have I, deploys a docking bay and draws.  I Transmission Terminated his Visage during his turn so I&#146;m off to a pretty good start except for the Bad Feeling Have I which he always gets early when he plays me.  I start with Yoda&#146;s Hut in my hand so I deploy it and use HB to get Corluag and insurrection for the Home One DB.  His turn he deploys another DB but doesn&#146;t drop Vader yet and draws.  For some reason when John is playing against HB he never deploys his Rendili that he normally pulls with Mob. Points.  I don&#146;t see why he does this as it can&#146;t help me flip.  My next turn I get out the rest of my sites except for the stupid Cantina and draw a few more.  John does pretty much the same on his turn.  I finally get things rolling by deploying Beru/Owen, Jedi Luke and Leia w/ blaster to his Endor DB for a ton of force thanks to Bad Feeling.  John sticks Vader and Janus at the Death Star DB.  I mistrack a five for an On The Edge but thankfully draw lucky a six instead.  I drain, he drains and I somehow mistrack the six I drew earlier and kill off Leia. I was really annoyed because usually I can accomplish simple tracking.   John deploys the Chimaera to Corluag allowing him to get around Battle Order.    I deploy the Falcon, which is barriered, and then deploy Ben with his stick and Lando with Vibro to the Tatooine DB.   John deploys Dr. E/Ponda Boba down with Vader and Janus and moves them over and duels Obi.  John plays Focused to draw a 7,3,7 for a total of 26 with the saber modifiers factored in.  My total comes out to 16.  I lose nine and Obi.  The game is looking bad for me at this point.  I screwed up my retrieval through my own stupidity and let Janus live long enough for John to track duel destinies.  However, this is not my worst mistake.  I deploy Captain Han to the Falcon.  John barriers him so I just draw a few instead of battling.  John Lat Damages the Falcon then deploys Zuckuss in MH and makes me lose 12 force from the overpower.  We drain each other for a turn or two until John finishes me off with a Limited Resources.<br>
FL 12<br>
0(-12)<br>
<br>
We finish under time despite my retarded and futile search for a Cloud City DB.  I write some notes on the game.  The pairings are called and I go sit across from my opponent and shuffle my deck.  I am looking through the deck and discover that I put three Sienar&#146;s and three Signal&#146;s in my TIE Interceptor deck.  I&#146;m sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.  I see that my opponents playing Jawas so I tell him about my Jawa deck (posted on my Deck Tech page).<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My SYCFA TIE Interceptors vs. Mike Camp&#146;s(1420)(no relation to John) AITC Jawas   <br>
<br>
I know from playing with a Jawa deck myself that they can  potentially drain for disgusting amounts so I am rather nervous.  I pull Wakeelmui and deploy Merrejk to the Death Star DB and pull a planet.  I draw up a Twilek and some TIEs.  He deploys Tessek to the Audience Chamber with herd of Jawas to protect him.  I activate three Twilek for Dreaded Imperial Starfleet then activate another three and Twilek for Sienar and activate the rest.  I deployed an Interceptor to a system and drew a few.  His turn he drains which I cancel with an Interceptor to Dreaded and deploys the Home One to battle my lone TIE he over powers me by nine but I just Ghhk the damage.  My turn I Lat Damage the Home One and drop three Interceptors and a Dreadnaught.  I initiate and make him lose 23 force in battle damage.  I spread and we drain each other for a turn or two.  He deploys another unique Star Cruises but I used Relentless Pursuit reduce its power to 0 and kill it off.  I drained him out shortly after that with about 6 cards in my lost pile.<br>
FW 29<br>
4(+17)<br>
<br>
Our game finished really fast so I went and watched the end of John and Joseph&#146;s game.  John was playing QMC against Joseph&#146;s AOTBS.  It was really close with John pulling out a really close victory.   Jon Tomayko the tournament director calls out the pairings and I play Joseph&#146;s DS next.  I helped Joe build the deck so I know it&#146;s going to be tough game. <br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
My Hidden Base Mains vs. Joseph Hennessey&#146;s (1494) Agents of the Black Sun<br>
<br>
Joseph begins the game by moving Xizor over to the Coruscant DB and drawing.  My turn I do the standard HB Mains activation set up and draw up my force pile.  Joe deploys Guri and a Vigo to the Death Star DB then moves Xizor over flipping his objective.  My turn I finish setting up my incredibly fast HB activation and draw a few more.  Joe makes me lose one to his objective and drains for two then deploys Snoova with axe and IG-88 to my Tatooine DB.  My turn I activate and deploy Master Luke with Lukes Saber on him, and Obi with Lightsaber to the same site as Snoova and IG-88.  I Clash IG-88 then initiate battle.  I weapon levitate Snoova&#146;s axe and then hit him with a saber.  Joe would have had to lose Snoova and 11 but he just Ghhks the damage.  We drain back and forth for a turn or two.  I have the advantage now that his objective is now on the sucky side.  I stick Dash on the Home One to drain at Corluag and then later put Lando with Vibro at the Tatooine DB.  Joe deploys Responsibility of Command on Luke so I can&#146;t drain their on my next turn.  However, on his next turn he drops Boba Fett, Snoova, and 4-lom to battle.   He initiates and I fallen portal Boba Fett.  He blanks Lando&#146;s game text he then play Jabba&#146;s Through With You.  I hit Snoova and miss 4-lom for the exclusion and the saber swing as well.  All his characters die and I lose Luke to the Bacta Tank canceling Responsibility of Command but flipping his objective as well.  He hits me for three damage during his control phase and draws some cards.  I pull Luke out of the tank and redeploy him at considerable expense.  I then persona replace Obi with Ben and his saber.  I ask the TD if I could put the replaced Obi in the tank so that I could pull him out and lose him to a force drain later.  The answer was yes at first until a second later when Craig our backup TD said that it wouldn&#146;t be possible because two Obi personas would be on the table.  We drain each other and I On the Edge for five.  Joe puts Emperor, Boba, and IG-88 at a Presence of the Forced Coruscant DB to do a little more damage before I kill him off.  I then deploy Tawss Khaa, Chewbacca, Protector, Han with Heavy and Leia with Blaster to battle Guri, Xizor and the Vigo.  I miss both shots on Guri but over power him by enough to kill off everyone but Guri.  Two turns later I drain him out.<br>
FW 23<br>
4(+40)<br>
<br>
After the game Joe tells me that he was sure that he had a Cloud City DB in his deck.  I say &quot;Oh @#$%&quot; and tell him about my earlier problem with my LS.  I must have accidentally grabbed after played him the night before and in my drunken stupidity used it in building my Hidden Base.  I apologized profusely but Josephs cool and isn&#146;t at all mad.  I feel really bad because the lack of that DB likely cost him the earlier game against John.  Pairings are called and I play Chris Work.  Chris is a really good player who makes tons of unusual decks.  His DS that day was a MKOS Tusken Raider deck.  Unfortunately for me his LS was an EBO deck that looked a lot like Deadbolt.  The two cards I took out of my deck to make room for my third Sienar and Twilek where Omni Box/It&#146;s Worse and Main Course.  This is gonna suck.<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My SYCFA TIE Interceptor deck vs. Chris Work&#146;s(1636) EBO Deadbolt<br>
<br>
Deadbolt is a great deck against TIEs.  Clint once beat me on his forth turn by thirty with it back when I was playing Monkey TIEs.  I deploy early to Kashyyk as I have Main Course, a Ghhk and Operational as Planned in my opening hand as protection.  Chris pulls Crix with Strike Planning and deploys an Echo site that he puts Wars Not Make One Great on.  On my turn I decide to forgo paying four to drain for two and instead draw.  Chris pulls Ketwol and puts A New Secret Base down which he uses to get another pair of Echo sites.  I pay to drain, deploy Wakeelmui, Sienar and a TIE to the Death Star DB to at least temporarily get around Battle Plan.  Chris gets EBO set up and draws for a few more.   I drain him and deploy another interceptor to Endor.  His turn he puts frozen assets on my force pile and I tell him to tell me when his deploy phase is over so I can use Operational as Planned to put down a force.  He deploys General Calrissian, General Solo and Leia with gun to the Death Star DB and tells me his deploy is finished.  I do nothing and he initiates.  He overpowers me by a lot but I am immune to battle damage on the Death Star.  Chris was very annoyed that he forgot that part of the objective.  I drain him uncontested for two turns but he continues to lock down about fifteen of my force.  He puts Cracken in his Tala to Hoth.  My turn I deploy a pair of Interceptors one with a cannon to kill it but he Hyper Escapes away to Wakeelmui.  His turn he cannot drain at Wakeelmui because of the Come Here You Big Coward which I deployed earlier.  He then deploys Luke in Red 5 and Dash in the Outrider to battle a lone TIE.  I Main Course his Frozen Assets during his deploy phase.  He retrieves it with Ketwol and tries to redeploy it but I point out its uniqueness and am able to Ghhk the battle damage.  On my turn I deploy a Dreadnaught, two Interceptors and a Laser Cannon on one of the TIEs and Lateral Damage Red 5.  I initiate and shoot Dash with an X=3 making him lost.  I play All Power to Weapons overpowering him by a lot.  He loses force but not Luke and I lose the Dreadnaught to attrition.  His turn he redeploys Frozen Assets and moves to the Death Star canceling Lateral Damage.  I activate drain for a few and stare in despair at the Frozen Assets covering my Force pile.  He deploys Wedge in his ship and overpowers a lone TIE making me lose several force.  My turn I draw looking for something then he drains me for an ungodly amount of force.  I make one last try and deploy an Interceptor with a gun to try and knock wedge of the battleground so CHYBC will come back into effect.  I initiate shoot and draw a three which is one less than what I need to kill Wedge.  I lose a few force and my TIE and gun.  The rest of the game was Chris draining me for incredibly large amounts while I could do nothing.<br>

<br>
This was the first time I had gone 2-2 in a long time.  It was very disappointing but I learned my lesson.  DON&#146;T BUILD DECKS WHILE INTOXICATED.  Jon Tomayko won the tournament and Craig Byrd got second.  John Camp got the random foil Imperial Decree (which he is currently auctioning for a disgusting amount on Ebay) and Jon Tomayko gave the foily Signal he got for winning to Joseph .  An interesting tournament but crappy for me.  Next time I will have my revenge. 	 <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
John and Joe for getting Foils<br>
Jon for being a good TD<br>
Good Friday for creating a four day school week<br>
Chris Work for playing Tusken Raider MKOS                     <br>
John for finally beating me in a sanctioned tournament<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me for taking out anti-deadbolt crap for stuff that doesn&#146;t make since<br>
Me for putting a DS card in a LS deck<br>
Me for probably costing Joe a game by accidentally stealing his card<br>
Me for building while under the influence <br>
