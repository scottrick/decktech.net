I was rated 1700 or so back then and Matt Berta became state champion. 1 Year later I am rated in the low 1900-s, and Matt Berta did not show up to defend his title. Weak. 19 people are in attendance, including Chris Hines, Tim Guzman, Brandon Gravo,Kris Lavigne, and Shane Watner. No one from Reno came down for this, but I expected that. Hines got the bye for game 1, and I had to play Tim Guzman. I was playing my standard WYS and MKOS Abyssins. <br>
<br>
Game 1:(1911) My WYS vs. (1923)Tim-s Court Imperial Space <br>
I start Squadass, Battle Plan, and something that I forgot about. sorry. He starts Mobile Points, SSPFT, and Crush The Rebellion I believe.<br>
My starting hand has Chewie with blaster and Han with blaster amongst other good stuff. On Tim-s first turn, he deployed Mara with a saber to the Cantina and saves 2 force. I play Frozen Assets, drop Han and Chewie and battle. I miss with shots, Dammit, and he doesn-t swing the saber. Bad for me. I draw attrition high enough to kill Mara and he draws Emperor Palpatine for destiny. In retrospect, I could have lost both guys, but I am used to having WYS flipped and Chewie being forfeit of 7. So I figure I can only lose 1 guy. I lose Han and strand Chewie for an imminent beatdown. EPP Vader and Merrejk show up and I lose some force after shooting the little guy. Then Tim setup some space and I tried to battle occasionaly on the ground but he ended up countering everything that I did. The game ends and he has about 1/2 of his deck left... jeez! I lose by 29<br>
0(-29)<br>
<br>
Props: Tim for playing Guzman style Star Wars.<br>
Slops: Me for thinking Chewie had better forfeit.<br>
<br>
The good news about this is that I-ll drop down to scrub level and pickup some easy wins. Not too honorable I guess, but hey, I&#146;ll take the W anyway I can.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Mkos vs. (1400ish) Mike Tortorelli-s RST scouts<br>
Mike has fun playing the game, but he isn-t the toughest guy to play by any means. No offense. <br>
I start with POTH, No Bargain, and Secret Plans. He does Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Strike Planning.<br>
I get out my sites in 2 turns and he gets Madine to the H1:DB. I get out Mosep and Gailid with support to the AC. He drops Scout Han and an ability 1 scout to rebel landing site. I bring some noise with IG-88, capture the lil rebel and kill off Han. He puts Home 1 at Endor with Akbar and some goons, and a few scouts at the Endor:DB. I put an abyssin at each unoccupied JP site to get the mad reserve deck drains on. He tacks away with his drain of 2, but I just deploy an abyssin in front of his dudes and battle, retrieve my 2 lost drain cards, Ghhk and recycle the Abyssin. I finish with no lost pile cards. I win by 36.<br>
2(+7)<br>
<br>
Good: It is always fun tp play Mike coz he have fun talking smack and joking and stuff.<br>
Bad: Not much of a game. Mosep and Gailid speed up games exponentially.<br>
<br>
So I find out that the next game I am playing Donnie Smith. The rule is: If you lose to Donnie, you burn your cards and quit the game. He is that ~bad~. <br>
<br>
Game 3: My WYS vs. (1200 something) Donnie Smith&#146;s Stormtrooper Assult. <br>
His SL is Kashyyyk with a Twi&#146;lek Advisor for Presence Of The Force. Uh, ok.... He would later say that he has no space in his deck. WTF? <br>
We start and he activates and draws. I squadass for Dash and drop him to Kashyyyk for the crazy silly fresh drain of 3. His next turn, he drops Premiere Vader and 5 stormtroopers to the cantina. I drop ECC Chewie and a Palace Raider to my newly deployed Mos Eisley. Hie activates and says, Elis Helrot. I say, Wha?! and he does it and move the squad to Eisley. He drops a gang more of troopers, and battles. I lose both my guys and he loses some troopers. Luckily he didn-t have a Trooper Assult. So I get Mirax setup at Tatooine, and I put Karrde and JK Luke at the Cantina for some crazy reason. His turn, Elis and he has the Trooper Assult now. I clear my side of the site and lose 10 on top of the forfeit values. WTF!!! so I abandon the ground, leave a Projection on the cantina and drain in space. I win by 19, but it was scary.<br>
4(+26)<br>
<br>
Good: Winning<br>
Bad: I had to Abandon the whole ground game. Who uses Elis Helrot? <br>
<br>
During the draining I see he had an Endor: Bunker and recommend he use it as his SL and put Presence on his opponent-s site and he says ok, but I do not know what became of this advice.<br>
<br>
So After 3 games, there are 3 undefeated players left. Chris HInes, Kris Lavigne, and Brandon Gravo. Tim Had just lost to Lavigne. We go to lunch and I hear horror tales that Kris has a killer dark deck. He took down both Shane Watner and Tim Guzman with it. Ususally Tim isn-t as rattled by a deck, so he had me a little worked up. We get done and head back for game 4.<br>
<br>
Game 4: MKOS vs. (1723) Jeff Lavigne-s Local Uprising<br>
Ok, is this last year? Elis Helrot, Operatives... This sucks, but it will be ok. I have Hutt Influence and ability to cancel 2 drains a turn with solid retrieval.<br>
He starts with Signal for Yarna.<br>
I setup my sites while he tries to get setup. I don-t remember too much from this game because it went so fast. He drops Maneuvering Flaps and a couple of speeders to 1 of his sites. I setup my 3 JP sites and Gailid/Mosep. 5 Turns of drains of 6 off the top subdues him. I ask how many cards in his hand and he says 13. Monnok lost. I get 2 speeders and 4 Xwings. Heh Heh Heh. I win after the drains do him in by 29.<br>
6(+54)<br>
<br>
Good: Fast drains<br>
Bad: I wish I had No Escape in my deck just to be funny.<br>
<br>
We got done in like 10 minutes so we (me and Jeff) go to the next door Kmart and buy a football coz we were all gonna play after the tournament. It ended up that we didn&#146;t play, but I still have the football so it is all good. <br>
<br>
Game 5: WYS vs. (1884) Kris Lavigne-s ~Killer~ ISB<br>
This is the deck that I was told to fear. I decided I&#146;d play cautiosly.<br>
He starts IAO, Mob. PTS., and SSPFT. I go with the BP, Squadass, and for my utility effect I pick Menace Fades. <br>
He starts by getting the Executor in hand with Mobile Points. The he gets the Exe:DB and puts Oberk, Piett and his newly searched for Merrejk. I respond with Dash Rendar to Tatooine. Look Out. I-m crazy! He gets out the Hoth:db and drops Billard 2, Ozzel, LT. Pol Tredium (flip) to Hoth :db and 5D6-RA-7 to Tatooine:db and pulls Kashyyyk. I put down a Projection at Hoth:DB and Lando and a Raider to Tatooine:db. He activates and tries to drain, but Menace Fades and Projection stop it. He Pulls Yavin DB and draws a few. I put down some Frozen Assets, DTF, Karrde, Melas, EPP Han and Mirax to Hoth DB. I put Bantha Droid at Yavin DB. I battle and clear the site and lose only Mirax. He says, What does Bantha Droid do? I say, cancels Lateral Damage. He goes, NO WAY! we go for a ruling and you know how that went. So he brings Avenger with Motti and and ORS to Kashyyyk. I respond with Wedge in RS1, (ANH Wedge, don-t worry) and Theron Nett in his Junk ship with I-ll Take The Leader. I battle and he does his Imperial Command and I kill the Ors and lose nothing thanks to a power destiny draw ala Nett. He brings Executor to Tatooine and I barrier. he puts some Pilots on there and moves Piett and Merrejk up from the DB. I put Mirax on the Outrider in front of the Executor. I battle the Avenger 1st, and he plays his Imperial Command. Good. I manage to kill the whole destroyer. I battle the Executor and manage a couple of foprce loss to him, but he just loses 1 of his pilots. I run away to Kashyyyk to unite my fleet. He treis to rally with Bossk in HT, and moving the Executor over, but after Sorry About the Messing his droid, my drains take him out. I win by 19 or so.<br>
8(+73)<br>
<br>
Good: Taking down the feared deck. And mad props to Bantha Droid. TECH TECH TECH! <br>
Bad: Not much. I played a good game of Star Wars.<br>
<br>
So now, Kris and I do some math and If I win my next game by 4 or more, I go to the final confrontation. Both table 1 and 2-s winners will go to the final confrontation. I play Brandon Gravo on table 2, and Chris Hines plays Tim Guzman.<br>
<br>
Game 6: MKOS Sweetness vs. (1819) Brandon Gravo-s EBO-X<br>
I like this. MKOS goes through EBO almost as easily as Hidden Base swarm. I start with Resistance this time.<br>
I setupmy sites pretty fast and get some reserve deck drains by turn 3. He gets EBO setup around the same time. Luckily for me, I can cancel drains, and his drains come off of his reserve. So he gets Hoth and Kashyyyk out with a couple of ships at each. I have some drain cancellers, but he does get a few in on me. He activates all his force so he can drain from his hand. I send up Fett in Ship to fight a lone Lando In Falcon. I get my 2 back from SAV, but Spiral pops up. I lose the battle by 4, so I forfeit the ship. He plays Legendary. NO! So I ose 2 more on my move phase. He drains and draws a couple. I drain and setup Search and Destroy. He deploys Kiffex (which  he just drew) and puts some ships there. He had forgot about being able to pull it. it would have been a drain of 6 over the past 3 turns if he had deployed it right. He all Wings-s to retrieve 7. I drain, lose my 2, search and destroy. He drains. I drain. I Win.... by 5. <br>
10(+78)<br>
<br>
Good: Winning by enough to get into the final.<br>
Bad: Legendary Starfighter, and for Gravo(at least) not deploying Kiffex. <br>
<br>
So I am in the final no matter what. I just got enough to cover a close game on table 1. Chris Hines ends up beating Tim Guzman and he will fight me in the final. So the regular tournament top 4 are:<br>
<br>
1) Chris Hines (undefeated with a bye)<br>
2) Dan Christy (me)<br>
3) Kris Lavigne<br>
4) Tim Guzman<br>
<br>
Prizes are passed out and we clear the game room for the final confrontation. Hines says he wants to be dark for game 1. FINE! (details will get fuzzy. it is hard to play this many consecutive games and then recall all of it.)<br>
<br>
Duel Game 1: WYS vs. (1939) Chris Hines-s Agents Of The Nubian Sun<br>
He starts IAO, Mobile Pts. and Crush. <br>
He pulls spaceport DB, drops 2 Vigo-s for free and Abiltiy, Ability, Ability. Moves Xizor (flip) and Monnoks me. He gets 2 control/visions from me. On my turn, I Squadass for Theron Nett, but not until after he plays A Dangerous Time. He makes me lose to his objective on his turn and draws. I deploy Karrde and Mirax to the Cantina and I get the ever so helpful Honor Of The Jedi. He brings some noise with Ig-88 and captures Mirax and kills Karrde. So I bring out Melas and a Raider to the docking bay on Tatooine. So He brings Jodo Kast and a Vigo. He captures Melas with a Hidden Weapons and I lose the raider and a couple. He transits Xizor and crew over. So I finally rally enough guys to kill Ax3 (Han and Chewie and Dash) and I get Dash to Tatooine on his Outrider. Han and Chewie go to CC DB.  He steadily drains at me, and keeps playing his dangerous time. So I finally get out a Luke, after playing Ounee Ta and deploying him cheap to the Spaceport DB. Han and Chewie transit there too. I can-t afford to have them captured. I draw a couple. He drains and draws a few. I deploy Karrde and wedge to CC:db, and I-ll Take the leader. I play A few Maneuvers on Theron and move him to Coruscant. I move Han and Chewie to Coruscant DB. On his turn he leaves me alone at Coruscant and transits some guys to the CC DB. So On my turn I say drain 1 at Tatooine. He loses a card. I say, drain 2 at Coru/DB. He says, How? I show him I-ll Take The Leader. He loses 2. I say drain 2 at Spaceport DB. He says I already drained for 1 there. I obviously didn-t so he loses his 2. and drain 1 at Coruscant. I transit my guys from CC to Tatooine. On his turn he deploys Mandalorian Armor on a Vigo at CC DB, and transits Ig-88, Jodo Kast and a Vigo to Spaceport DB. I drain alot again at the docking bays and a few at the systems. Eventually it gets to be too much and he runs out of cards. I win by 6.<br>
<br>
Good: Beating another deck that was supposedly tough to beat.<br>
The Bad: I won by the same amount that I won game 1 by last year.... could I break the curse? no... of course not...<br>
<br>
Duel 2: Loyal Damn Abyssins that Rock vs. WYS<br>
He starts Battle Plan which will slow my drains down. I get setup fast in the palace, and he gets a Falcon and Chewie setup.I have a drain of 4 off of his reserve going when he deploys Luke w/Saber to the Cantina using Beggar to eat my saved force. I get Arica to the cantina, but she got messed. He drains, but I use my drain cancellers to save myself. He gets Kessel drain setup with Wedge and an x-wing cannon. I bring Myo, Dengar, and an Abyssin to the cantina. He clashes Myo down. I draw 1 too many, meaning my last force. He activates, drains, and clashes Dengar. Drops Lando w/gat and Karrde and Draw Their Fire. I lose the Abyssin and 14. Crippling loss. I have to pay for my drains and he doesn-t, and I just lost a load of force. So we exchange drains and I try a couple of desperate battles, but I can-t come back. I lose by 8. just like last year... and in case you wonder how I got him down that far, ALL of the drains had to come from reserve and can-t be cancelled coz of Hutt Influence. So there!<br>
<br>
So I am Runner-up 2 years in a row, but that is fine with me coz I am happy just having made the final confrontation. Congrats to Chris Hines. He got his Vengeance on me for knocking him out of the chance to go to the final last year.<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Me for beating the dark decks that everyone struggled with, except for Tim-s.<br>
Shane for waitng as I played in the final so I could get a ride home.<br>
Chris Hines for being State Champ.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
MATT BERTA for finding a way to not go and defend his title. I guess maybe you are over-rated... ;)<br>
Tim Guzman for letting luck make him lose his last game and keeping him out of the final ;)<br>
Decipher, they should have had Glass... oh well.. <br>
<br>
The end and see you guys at GenCon.<br>
