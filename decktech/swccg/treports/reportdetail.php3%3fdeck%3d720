I email everyone for feedback and get some good ideas to start with making<br>
the next RamapoCon.  The biggest problem was going about having it so soon<br>
to the last one, 7 months.  I decided though that if I was going to make<br>
RCon a regular event, May might me the best time for it.  After having all<br>
winter to think it over, I started this semester at Ramapo and started to<br>
get things underway.  I reserved the room from last year for Saturday but<br>
was not allowed to have it other days, after much negotiations I was able<br>
to get some large sized rooms for what I thought would be three great days<br>
of tournaments and fun...I was definitely right on that one.<br>
<br>
So the next three months required a lot of travelling to other area to<br>
promote the tournament.  I ended up travelling to Clarks Summit (PA),<br>
Columbia (MD), Long Island, Staten Island, Albany, Philly, and countless<br>
promote the tournament.  I ended up travelling to Clarks Summit (PA),<br>
Columbia (MD), Long Island, Staten Island, Albany, Philly, and countless<br>
other places.  It was great travelling!  I also became a human plug<br>
machine for the Convention.  Much thanks for George Gundry, Nathan Brown<br>
and everyone else that plugged this tournament everywhere they went.<br>
<br>
A big thing that happened as far as promotion goes is when David Akers put<br>
information about RamapoCon II on Decktech.  Kim Caton wrote a article for<br>
me with the schedule and then David put it up for me.  Thanks again David!<br>
<br>
The big thing that happened to me and turned this into a great convention<br>
was the Ramapo College giving me $2000 to help cover the expenses of<br>
getting everything I needed to make this tournament as exciting as<br>
possible.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the prizes I got for RCon II<br>
<br>
Champion Trophy<br>
-2-6 place Trophies for Main Tournament<br>
-4 Team Champion Trophies<br>
-1 Uncut Premiere Rare Sheet<br>
-1 Uncut Common MofDM YJ Sheet<br>
-150 Reflections foils consisting of Darth, DLots, Obi, Yoda, Falcon<br>
-Signed Mara Jade Poster (thanks Bart)<br>
-Signed Mara Jade and Mara's Saber (Thanks Nathan)<br>
-Sony Playstation<br>
-Jedi Powers Playstation game<br>
-SW Legos that Tom Hermley Keen gave me<br>
-other SW Toys/items<br>
-Sebulba Foil<br>
-30 YJ Rares that Lembo and Haman gave me<br>
-Tons of booster packs from Austin Powers, Young Jedi, SE, CC and JP<br>
-A YJ and AP T-shirt<br>
-40 RamapoCon II T-shirts<br>
-Chilis Gift Certificates<br>
-Signed posters to random people signed by everyone involved in the<br>
tournament<br>
-Signed Tanis and Velkin cards by Kevin Reitzel and Juz Pakes<br>
<br>
<br>
So after I was able to get all of the prizes organized I needed to get<br>
events planned.  After all was said and done we had these events-<br>
2 SW Constructed Friday tournaments<br>
2 YJ Constructed Saturday tournaments<br>
RCon Championship (Sat)<br>
No Such Thing As Luck (Sat)<br>
Booster Draft Sealed Deck using CC, JP and Premiere (Sat)<br>
2 Austin Powers tournaments (Sat)<br>
RCon Team Tournament (Sun)<br>
<br>
Looking for volunteers to run the events was easy!  I actually had to turn<br>
people away because I wanted to give the Squadron Members a chance to<br>
play.  Here was the list of people I had running events-<br>
<br>
Rich Haman<br>
Ted Panczyszyn<br>
Chris Gogolen<br>
Jason Lembo<br>
Doug Faust<br>
<br>
Plus Bart Robinson and Blythe Hermley-Keen kept everything going on<br>
Saturday!<br>
<br>
So after the events, prizes, and Rooms were ready it was time to get some<br>
special guests...Justin Pakes and Kevin Reitzel happened to have some time<br>
and was able to make the trip with Dan Bojanowski, The Virginia State<br>
Champ. The best part is that they came up as Three Star Wars players and<br>
not Decipher guys which was great because neither of them had had the<br>
chance to play in a while.<br>
<br>
So come Friday, I was able to stress a bit and get things ready to start<br>
up.  So Jonathan Chu and Charlie Herren go and eat with me, during that I<br>
meet up with Todd Thiener, Craig Berry, and Mike Blythe but they are tired<br>
and want to get sleep so they leave for the hotel until 2pm.  So waiting<br>
around and getting ready we meet with Tom Hermley-Keen and Mike Dalton.<br>
After going to the room that the tournament was going to be for and<br>
noticing that it was a sauna, I decided to find a different room.  After<br>
finding another room the first tournament Rich Haman started the<br>
tournament with 12 people including my only tournament participation<br>
during the weekend (besides a thrashing by Travis for fun on Sunday).<br>
<br>
Onto the games.<br>
<br>
Game 1 Anktopot vs Mike Dalton's (2010) TR Mains<br>
<br>
Mike and I have played these two decks plenty of times against each other.<br>
My guess is 10 times in playtesting and 4 in tournament play.  The one<br>
time in tournament play I won was in states and I knew he would get<br>
revenge, not to mention stay away from the D* Docking Bay this time too.<br>
I don't remember much about this game except the game was very close back<br>
and forth with me taking out his Falcon with Zuckuss and Vader piloting<br>
and him picking off Vader a few times.  The big blow that swung the game<br>
was me leaving Dengar by himself at a site...he dropped EPP Luke and EPP<br>
Han, hit Dengar then drew 2 destiny...I was able to play Res Luk Rauf to<br>
get 1 Battle Destiny and I hit both Han and Luke but I lost 16 force to<br>
the battle...game over.<br>
<br>
FL (-15)<br>
<br>
Highlights-Hitting Luke and Han with Dengar<br>
Lowlights- Losing 16 in that battle...<br>
<br>
So I get to play Todd Theiner next.  We played last at an 8th Man at DCon<br>
at a 3am tournament...we played about 4 or 5 am then so we both don't<br>
remember much about it.  I do know we split those games though.<br>
<br>
Game 2 Juz's Revenge vs Todd Theiner's (1723) Hunt Down<br>
<br>
This game went really well for me.  In fact, I had a Character named Tawss<br>
Khaa single handedly beat the Dark Side.  I had Draw Their Fire out and<br>
retrieved 5 times I battled with Tawss.  To make it worse I predicted<br>
right in each of those battles and retrieved 5 more with Tawss' gametext.<br>
I was so happy, I had Todd sign my Tawss.  The entire game I was drawing 5<br>
destinies and his were extremely low.  Not much he could do, especially<br>
after canceling Visage.  Before the game Chu was talking about 2 Tawss<br>
Khaa's aren't needed...during the game I was shouting out how much force<br>
she retrieved and it made me laugh...I guess you had to be there ;).<br>
<br>
FW (+25)<br>
<br>
2(+10)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Tawss baby!  10 retrieved force from her.<br>
Lowlights- None<br>
<br>
Game 3 Anktopot vs Jonathan Chu's (1983) LS Juz's Revenge (Twigg Style)<br>
<br>
So I know I can win this game because my lightside deck can never win<br>
against the dark...strange but true.  I had Visage going the whole game<br>
and great activation too so having Hunt Down flipped early made his life<br>
miserable.  I used my Holonet's to cancel his TT's and that kept Visage<br>
going.  Put All Sections On Alert is definitely now my favorite card.  I<br>
was happy that I made a believer of that Saturday out of Juz when he put<br>
it in his deck ;).<br>
<br>
FW (+6)<br>
<br>
4(+26)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Beating the eventual Two-time RamapoCon II Champion ;)<br>
Lowlights- not winning by enough ;)<br>
<br>
Game 4 Juz's Revenge vs Jonathan Chu's (1983) ROps<br>
<br>
This game was maybe close for the first 5 minutes but after that I was<br>
dead.  My deck cannot deal with the forfeit bonus that the IAO and AT-ST<br>
Pilots get along with the Reacts.  The destinies are all two high with the<br>
objective...plus he started Resistance.  How could he not.  This game had<br>
some chance but having Tawss and EPP Luke stranded on Yavin draining for 0<br>
and Obi-Wan getting lost in the desert on Raltiir didn't help.<br>
<br>
FL (-20)<br>
<br>
4(+6)<br>
<br>
Highlights- Using Projections to cancel drains<br>
Lowlights- Taking out the Tibrin in my deck...not that it would have<br>
mattered ;).<br>
<br>
So I scrub out against good competition and take 7th place and Charlie<br>
Herren gets the Captain Han Solo Foil.  I go and check the phone messages<br>
because Bart is coming up by train...and he leaves one.  I wasn't sure how<br>
long he was at the train station so I grab Gogolen to help me pick him up.<br>
On the way to the car we see Juz, Kevin Reitzel and Dan Bojonowski (VA<br>
State Champ).  We show them to the room and all of a sudden 28 people are<br>
in the room when we get Bart back!  Everyone started coming out of the<br>
woodwork.  The tournament would have been larger but some of the Albany<br>
guys wanted to tech for the big tournament tomorrow.   This tournament<br>
went extremely well with a great turnout.  Rich Haman helped me keep this<br>
tournament organized!  It was great to see Juz, Kevin playing again for<br>
the first time in a while!<br>
<br>

21      John Terkovich 2(-21)<br>
22      Thomas Hermley-Keen 2(-28)<br>
23      Douglas Ellwanger 2(-60)<br>
24      Alexander Meseguer 2(-76)<br>
25      Brent Haertlein 2(-88)<br>
26      Justin Pakes 0(-48)<br>
27      Luis Rodriguez 0(-57)<br>
<br>
So after the tournament (Which Rich helped again with!) I did my version<br>
of Kevin Reitzel's 'Because I can' prizes for some cool gameplay events.<br>
One of which was Manny Rodriguez having 4 biker scouts, 4 bikes, 4 biker<br>
cannons all at the same site.  The best one however was Tom Hermley-Keen<br>
using sniper with 4Lom to cancel Yoda's gametext so he could battle him!<br>
After the battle he even captured him with All Wrapped Up.  The top decks<br>
in the tournament were again Hunt Down, ROps, and Y4 Mains.  A big thanks<br>
to Kevin and Justin to being able to come up and play in their first<br>
tournament in a long time.  I believe this was Juz's first constructed<br>
tournament since 1998 in Austrailia.  As for Kevin, not exactly sure ;).<br>
<br>
So I gave away the Jabba the Hutt foil to Jonathan Chu and I had some of<br>
the George Gundry 'special idea' posters signed by everyone and gave them<br>
away.  There was also a group of younger players that I gave some of the<br>
extra packs to and each of them also got Tanis and Velken signed cards.  I<br>
gave away packs of Jabba's Palace and Special Edition, which made everyone<br>
happy.  Afterwards, everyone went home and I went with Juz, Kevin and Dan<br>
to show them where the hotel was.  We show up, chatted a bit about tech<br>
and such for Saturday's tournament.<br>
<br>
Best quote of the weekend for me happened as us 4 were walking back to<br>
Dan's car right after the #2 earlybird.  I asked Juz what he was going to<br>
play for Light Side tomorrow (Sat) and he said, 'I am going to play Juz's<br>
Revenge since someone named the deck after me.'  He didn't realized who<br>
thought of the deck name so I kind of smiled and said, 'Juz, that was me.'<br>
I thought it was funny, guess you had to be there.<br>
<br>
So Juz and I worked on his dark deck and light decks, swapping cards out<br>
of my deck and into his as needed.  Saturday was going to be a good day<br>
for him and some of the tech he used was just plain awesome.  At about 3am<br>
I got into bed in time for my 3 hours of sleep.  Friday night was great<br>
all of us sitting around chatting for a while, Kevin was making his deck,<br>
Dan was just relaxing and Juz was trying to figure out some secret<br>
tech...that tech was to be placed in his deck for Saturday.<br>
<br>
So sleep was a good thing at 3am.  Day 2 report will be coming <br>
