Pre-tourney notes<br>
***<br>
<br>
Coming off a successful first day of RamapoCon II, I tweak <br>
my decks a little bit prior to the big tournament on <br>
Saturday.<br>
<br>
The big decision to make was between playing Yavin 4 droids<br>
or mains. The droid deck is a machine - by now everyone<br>
knows it uses hit and run EPPs for big battle damage, <br>
combined with droid inserts for a huge one or two turn loss<br>
that is difficult, if not impossible, to recover from. The<br>
mains deck was more solid -  but also more boring, and it's<br>
been around for a long time. On Friday, Imperial Barrier<br>
was surprisingly popular, making hit and run difficult, and<br>
the area in general was prepped for droids, so mains <br>
became the deck of choice.<br>
<br>
Saturday morning, I only made a few changes. In my ROPs deck,<br>
I switched out a Sandwhirl for a Monnok - almost everyone<br>
had heard at some point about some guy who had gotten <br>
everyone Sandwhirled at the desert on Ralltiir, so nobody<br>
was about to deploy or move there. I also swapped Imperial<br>
Decree for Bubo - a tough call. Yavin 4 was rampant and <br>
a first turn Bubo would be, in effect, a 2/0 site for the<br>
purposes of activation, but with 4 destiny. Also, Decree <br>
was always a tough card to get active - with only four <br>
ships in the deck, I never liked to put them at my <br>
battleground systems to control the two system/one site <br>
requirement. For the light side, I swapped my R-3P0 for <br>
an Uncontrollable Fury, mainly because R-3P0 never saw<br>
any action and Fury is huge, if only to get rid of a<br>
You Are Beaten from your opponent's hand. I also switched<br>
Revolution for a Rebel Barrier. The rest of the decks can <br>
be found in my report of Day one.<br>
<br>
***<br>
Day 2: the main tournament<br>
***<br>
<br>
Sixty-eight people showed up to compete at the second<br>
RamapoCon, held at Ramapo College, NJ. The competition<br>
was stiff; notable names included Brian and Chris Terwiliger,<br>
Matt Sokol, Steve Brentson, Charlie Herren, Mike Dalton,<br>
Chris Praskac, Wojciech Jankowski, and Dan Bojanowski, <br>
among others. Team Albany and Ghetto Squad were out en force.<br>
There were players from ten states, including Michigan,<br>
Georgia and Virginia. Even Juz Pakes and Kevin Reitzel from<br>
Decipher were playing.<br>
<br>
The tournament started a little late, but quickly made up<br>
the time - helping Scott Lingrell were Thomas and Blythe <br>
Hermley-Keen, Bart Robinson, and Rich Haman, all of whom<br>
did an excellent job keeping the main event organized and<br>
efficient. Props to them all.<br>
<br>
On to the games.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Game One: LS vs Wojciech Jankowski (2002)'s Endor Ops<br>
<br>
Yeah.... what a great starting opponent. I was hoping for<br>
an easier victory, but I was also confident about the <br>
matchup - I had played Woj, each of us with the same decks,<br>
at last year's RamapoCon and more recently, the Philly GS, <br>
notching wins of 26 and 30, so I knew more or less how to<br>
play it.<br>
<br>
I got a decent draw and dropped a 2/0, a nudj and drew. His<br>
turn, he put out two systems to commence the force <br>
activation and drew also. Most of the game, he either had<br>
as much force activation as I did, or more - this worried<br>
me a little because in the previous two matchups I had with<br>
him, he was choked for the greater part of those games. In<br>
any case, I got out an early Bacta Tank, reinforced later<br>
by Savrip, and these allowed me to keep my guys around in <br>
space. I only packed three ships, so this was key. Control<br>
of the ground was mine the whole game, and when Battle Plan<br>
hit the table, I cleared off any guys he had left so he had<br>
to pay for his sparse drains the rest of the game. This <br>
matchup sucks ass for dark.<br>
FW 2(+21)<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting the good matchup. Getting out the Tank,<br>
Savrip and having SAC dominate his red cards.<br>
Lows: The matchup sucked for him. Vesden hanging out in the<br>
bunker with a Nudj for a +2 drain somewhere almost every <br>
turn late in the game when I had it in hand.<br>
<br>
The big names recorded wins for the most part after the<br>
first game, not surprisingly. One notable upset - Juz beat<br>
Ray Bordier by a good margin. The second game moved in <br>
without any delay - interestingly (and to their loud<br>
disapproval), the Terwiliger brothers were matched up. I<br>
was paired with Patrick Ziagos, from Clarks Summit, PA. <br>
<br>
Game Two: ROPs vs Patrick Ziagos (1821)'s Hidden Base Revo<br>
<br>
He started Hidden Base... and I thought immediately, auto-<br>
win. He was a really nice guy who played slowly, but <br>
thoroughly. The game started out rough from the first turn -<br>
I got one 2/0 site, which is nice, but his turn, he drops <br>
3 2/0's and revolves mine. So I activate my 3, draw... no<br>
2/0's. He puts out another 2/0 (count the force advantage...<br>
15 to 4) and draws. I hit him with a used monnok to reduce<br>
his hand size drastically but damn he just drew it all<br>
back the turn after. Soon he gets out a Traffic Control <br>
and puts everything he needs in his hand and everything else<br>
back into his deck. He has guys all over my planet and I<br>
was activating basically nothing. The game was slow - I had<br>
a few small victories on the ground here and there - but he <br>
played it smart, always had enough in his hand to wreck what<br>
I put down, and prevented the flip long enough to make it<br>
useless. Civil Disorder locked the game down.<br>
FL 0(-15)<br>
Overall: 2(+6)<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting a 2/0 in my hand! That was all...<br>
Lows: I think out of 10 games, ROps would beat his deck<br>
7 or 8. He got a damn good draw, but to his credit, Patrick<br>
played it like a champ, preventing the trademark ROPs<br>
turnaround.<br>
<br>
So after getting hammered, I went outside to see how<br>
everyone else had done. Brian had gotten massacred by Chris<br>
by 33 cards, and it seemed like Revolution decks were <br>
pretty popular - both Travis Desell and Chris Praskac <br>
were sporting them and went 6-0 each between this tournament<br>
and the team tournament. I was disappointed in the previous<br>
game but didn't really care and went into game three <br>
ready to kick ass and chew bubble gum...<br>
<br>
Game Three: LS vs George Gundry (1543)'s Court Snowtrooper <br>
Odds<br>
<br>
That's right... Court Snowtrooper Odds. He played a first<br>
turn Twi'lek and snagged Undercover... and then pulled <br>
Hoth: Docking Bay from his deck and Garindan using the JP<br>
gametext. heheh....<br>
<br>
Luke with Lightsaber hit the Sarlacc pit to stop the Court<br>
GT force loss, and I drew. He drew. I got some more<br>
activation and drew... lots of guys in my hand. His turn,<br>
he puts out Serg Major Bursk (the snowtrooper guy), a cadet, <br>
and a snowtrooper... no insert. I slap down Obi-Wan, his<br>
saber, Tawss and some guys for a beating. His cadet moves <br>
away into the Hoth: war room and I sense his Trooper assault<br>
for a load of damage. The rest of this game goes downhill<br>
for him, as he can't keep any guys on the table for insert <br>
and any red cards he put out got SAC'ed away. Hell, his<br>
Sarlacc couldn't even touch Luke. It was a mess.<br>
FW 2(+29)<br>
Overall: 4(+35)<br>
<br>
Highs: the game<br>
Lows: not being able to kill Garindan, who sat undercover<br>
in the audience chamber the whole game.<br>
<br>
Chris Terwiliger was undefeated at this point, along with<br>
Ghetto Leader himself, sitting at the head table all the <br>
way up to this point. Michael Dalton was also undefeated. <br>
Dalton got paired up with little Twigg and Hodur played<br>
a Team Albany member, Mike D'amboise, who was sporting<br>
a nifty Profit numbers deck. I went back to inching my way<br>
to the top table.<br>
<br>
Game Four: my ROPs vs Frank Walsh (1717)'s Profit mains<br>
<br>
This game starts real slow... decent draw but after that I'm<br>
getting nothing I need. He draws for like 5 turns straight,<br>
and by then I flip, but I'm not draining for any because<br>
I'm stupid and I put out Battle Order. He flips with eight<br>
cards in his lost pile and retrieves them all. So it goes<br>
back and forth, I'm losing 4, he's losing 4, and it's close.<br>
I don't put out Oppressive because he started Do or Do Not<br>
so there's obviously no SAC involved in his deck... and he<br>
makes me pay by playing On the Edge, tracking a six, when<br>
I have only two cards left. Ouch. That puts the game slightly<br>
in his favor, but he mistracks the next time and kills off<br>
his Obi and the saber that was put on him. Kashyyyk comes<br>
out way too late, but it's enough to put me ahead in the<br>
drain race. Ability^3 plugs him a few times because he only<br>
plays with the main characters basically and First Strike<br>
helps a little bit. The little damage is what does him in.<br>
FW 2(+5)<br>
Overall 6(+40)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning against a player that is better than his<br>
ranking<br>
Lows: I played like a shmuck all game and underestimated<br>
his deck. I won't do that with profit anymore.<br>
<br>
I'm going to trim the analysis because my plane is leaving<br>
soon. Hodur is still sitting at the top table, which is<br>
cool as hell. Twigg beat Dalton and is paired up with Hodur; <br>
Praskac is also still undefeated.<br>
<br>
Game Five: my ROPs vs Steve Brentson (2031)'s Speeder Ops<br>
<br>
This is my first time talking or playing with Steve. I was<br>
looking forward to this game -  I thought the matchup was <br>
in my favor because I've played against some of the best<br>
Speeder Ops in the world back in Nashville and I know how<br>
to play ROps against it. <br>
<br>
So I start the stuff and begin collecting guys to put all<br>
over his planet. My opening hand helps out a lot - a 2/0, <br>
Tempest 1, Blizzard 2, and Darth Vader EPP. That's power<br>
for you. I draw a little and he goes. He puts out a Flaps<br>
and a site and draws. I plop another 2/0 and draw. During<br>
his turn, he locks flaps, puts out an Incom, an ithorian, <br>
and two speeders at the swamp on Bothauwi. During my turn, I drop Tempest 1,<br>
some 2/2 scrub, and some other guy, trample his engineer,<br>
and commence the beating. He moves his remaining speeders<br>
away and puts out some more to ensure it doesn't get <br>
hammered and draws. My turn, I feel silly and flip with <br>
Arden, some 2/2 scrub and some other 2/2 scrub on ralltiir, <br>
with Barrier as my only protection. But his hand isn't big<br>
enough to pose an immediate threat and I alter his Flaps<br>
successfully when Vader comes down for a beatdown so I feel<br>
safe. The whole game I am retrieving with First Strike when<br>
I battle and making him lose guys. Destinies come out in my<br>
favor - one time he has an engineer, an ithorian and an op <br>
in a speeder at a site. I look for something, see four 3's<br>
in my reserve deck, and trample/capture his guys so he only<br>
gets one destiny. Eventually I flip him back and drain him<br>
out.<br>
FW 2(+16)<br>
Overall 8(+56)<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting a great draw, knowing how to play against<br>
the deck and beating a tough opponent.<br>
Lows: nothing, really.<br>
<br>
Little Twigg beat Hodur that game, so him and Praskac are<br>
the only two undefeateds left. Unfortunately, they were<br>
the same side so they can't play - I'm at the second table,<br>
playing Travis Desell (who is dark side, luckily for me, <br>
since I pack no Revo protection), while Hodur and Praskac<br>
duke it out in the battle of the Ghetto, and Twigg is<br>
playing the highest 4-1 on his side, John Lolli, at the #1<br>
table.<br>
<br>
Game Six: my LS mains vs Travis Desell (1683)'s ROPs.<br>
<br>
Travis is a good buddy of mine at home and he's much better<br>
than his rating - he didn't play for a long time, came back<br>
and got hammered. His dark deck was a modified version of <br>
Charlie Herren's ROPs deck he used to win the Florida GS, <br>
and I knew basically every card and also knew that he would<br>
stand a great chance of winning if he got a good draw. That's<br>
ROPs for you, nothing special. So I was happy as hell when<br>
he didn't put down any 2/0's his first turn.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, my hand had 2 2/0's in it... hell yeah.<br>
I had like a 15 force difference in activation in my favor<br>
the entire game, and anything he put out got hammered into<br>
oblivion. This game was a total rout - the only 2/0 he put<br>
out all game was the Ice Plains, and I put down Orrimaarko<br>
at my Hoth: War Room and moved over for a drain of two the<br>
whole game. Obi and his saber were draining their share<br>
at the docking bay, and Tantive and some guys were chillin<br>
up in space. Civil Disorder came out and the Lockdown was<br>
complete.<br>
FW 2(+32)<br>
Overall 10(+88)<br>
<br>
Highs: my hand was ridiculously good and his was horrible.<br>
There wasn't much of a game in this game. We played outside<br>
right after, same matchups, and it was close but he ended<br>
up winning. Shows how much of a difference a good draw<br>
makes, especially in a close matchup like this.<br>
Lows: none<br>
<br>
Little Twigg won again, but Praskac lost to Hodur in a <br>
tough game, so Twigg was the only undefeated. He claimed<br>
first place, and I was the 5-1 player with the highest<br>
differential, so I got to play him in the final duel in <br>
an attempt to defend my RamapoCon title.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I gotta go catch my plane to go back to<br>
Nashville now, so I will include the final duel in Part <br>
3 of my RamapoCon II report, which covers the team <br>
tournament. Thanks for reading.<br>
