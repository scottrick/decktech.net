It was a six game event and about twenty odd people show up and play.<br>
<br>
Pre tourny day junk stuff.<br>
Well Im thinking what to play and I decided that my wys which turned out to be junk needed overhauling so I altered it a little and threw something together.  It looked a bit better and I will post it. As for dark my MKOS kicked a$$ last week and I put it into early retirement seeing as I didnt build it.  So I tried something different and went with Agents of the black sun.  The beauty of this was I was feeling kinda lazy so I could use this to track.  I then ripped all the useable stuff from mkos and added anything else turns out looking like a pile but useable and it was a bit late.<br>
Well I turn up to the tourny and see that no one is here yet.  Well I had just quit my job the other day and I am actually broke so I had to sell a few cards to leigh (the guy that I live near and help out) and he buys off me wedge rsl, rs1, and wicket (yes wicket) foils for a total of 20 smackers(AUSSIE DOLLAR) which is about right for them I think but I still felt like I ripped him off cause I gave him the wicket heh heh. But anyway  I now have enough and some left for lunch.  Well before we start people rock up and borrow cards off me and I borrow off others so I borrow a jedi luke while loaning an empy of each type to this guy I borrow an xizor and iggy and gun,and a chewie protector, some vigos and a guri.  Enough junk time for the games.<br>
<br>
Warning: this is not a two hundred page essay and I wont be saying when someone activates a force alright just some basic highlights so dont me to go: I activate a force, and another, and another and another. k? no are you dumb?<br>
<br>
Any way Game 1<br>
My Bastardized WYS VS Adrew Leoungs BHBM<br>
Well his start is the usual obj stuff and his effects were crush, iao, mob points.  the idea of his deck is to establish drains of lots on endor, the problem with his deck was he has no space which is crazy in melb scene.  he gets out ds 2 db and empy at my tat db. of course im tempted to get out my jedi luke but I dont have a stick in my hand. I get out docking bay kessel and just draw up.  he puts a vader at my db and moves empy over and takes over the cantina with him which later on is backed up by sim janus scrub pilots while vader is sitting at the db with jedi luke.  I take over kessel with dash in outrider with melas cause I was expecting zuckuss and I had a barrier so I wasnt too scared of anything there.  I wish I hadnt of taken out the kessel run part of my deck big mistake.  Battle plan was making him pay for the drains while I had taken over my space port docking bay with chewie protector and tallon plus someone else. My eg-4 was offing the edge to retrieve for me which kept me in the game. I used brawl to get rid of some people but missed them all. his sac was pi$$ing me off before I flipped.  I tried to wookie strangle vader when he moved over but missed by one(didnt realise you add ability as well). I ended up getting him down to two cards he couldnt drain and I win by the easy duece.<br>
FW 2(+2)<br>
The Good: Me controlling kessel all game.<br>
The Bad: Missing the brawl and choke empy in the cantina<br>
The Ugly: Two jedi lukes and i cant use em.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My Bastardized AOTBS VS Joel lee x wing swarm<br>
Well this guy is I guess a newbie and he doesnt have any good objectives to use so he starts with aquaris with his starting effect as insights, squad a$$ignments and he tried to start with another but it wasnt immune to alter so he didnt replace it.  This game wasnt interactive and I took over tatooine jp, db, ac with drains of 1,2, and 2 plus search and destroy plus objective damage killing him. he had dash at aquaris for the generation boost I dropped bossk checked my destiny and saw that I had a one so I would have lost that battle so I move to sullust and he drops keir santage in red 7 I barrier, then he drops ackbar on independance. I drew the one and lost just bossk. He came down to one of my sites where I had vigo, dengar and boba fett. with orrimako and chewie, protector he battles and I couldnt shoot cause he canceled dengars game text I shoot with boba at orri cause I had a sniper dark strike but miss. I drew a six for destiny and he loses chewie. Later I relised that he should have lost both cause attrition would have been 9. so I lost the vigo my turn I use no escape and drop the vigo again drop Iggy and battle shoot orrimako drew a 6 and a 5 for battle destiny and he drew 3? I capture orri he loses 18 more and eventually I retrieve my lost pile and win by 36 <br>
FW 4(+38)<br>
The Good: Tatooine Control, Objective actually working.<br>
The bad: Playing a scrub?<br>
the ugly: not remembering attrition bonuses, it could have been a better game.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
MY ls vs john lampe endor ops/ds2 deck.<br>
This guy is mean and nasty and he didnt want me saying this on my tr so I do it anyway.  He says that hes lost already and I believe him I have beaten this deck before and know some mechanics of it.  He starts endor ops with operational as planned to get ds2, moff and desperate counter.  he dominates tatooine most of the game so I dont get celebration going. ds2 gets up and running and I am tempted to blow it away. I get jedi luke out with a stick and take control of cantina and kessel. battle order is slowing him down.<br>
I use off the edge cause he dont have retrievel protection and he says that if I lose by less then 20 then I am sh!t of course I win by drains and get him by 20.<br>
Fw 6(+58)<br>
the good: Getting my light to win games this week<br>
The bad: John  ended up one place above me<br>
The Ugly: have you seen this guys face, reminds me of a vomit I once did and boy was it vile and rotten (j/k john)<br>
<br>
Between this game I play Stuart caldwell in a game of raw deal so here we go<br>
My Steve Austin Starter deck vs Stuarts Chris benoit starter<br>
well I start but I dont have enough fortitude for anything so I let him go he trys some strike moves but I reverse them. Eventually I get going and get my fortitude up to about 16. but then he gets going and his game text of his character is dragging me down and he ends it by going off the top rope and ends it there<br>
FL<br>
the good: fun and different<br>
the bad: bad starting hand<br>
The ugly: No trademark finish move for me<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My ds vs Daniel Robertsons wys<br>
Well this game I made a few mistakes. He starts wys with squada$$, insu-erection and staging areas. I start the same and maybe just should use secret plans. he gets captain han on falcon to kessel and I decide to visit with bossk, and zucka$$ and a vigo. well here come the interrupts I know, punch it and he gets his five destiny to my two I lose everything and he slaps a legendary starfighter on it.  Jedi Luke is screwing me on ground and he cancels my scum I make a few more mistakes and he retrieves some and the only real highlight was guri and xizor vs jedi luke ?I brief loss of control and drew a destiny of three so he lost four cause of starships at tatooine.<br>
I end up losing to drains and leg starfighter by 28<br>
FL 6-(+30)<br>
The Good: Brief Loss of control<br>
The Bad: My fight vs falcon.<br>
The Ugly: Jedi luke taking over fat jabbas<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
My Ds vs Donovan Klemms hidden base(OMDH)<br>
He starts Insurrection, staging areas, wise advice and i am thinking hes playing hidden mains so I do my usual and this time I am lucky not to draw the coruscant db in my starting hand I get xizor and guri over to the tat db and he comes down with obi asnd stick, leia and stick, horn, tallon, and someone else. He battles and uses his stick but I switch off and I lose both of them and four more he oocs and gets a bossk in bus. about five turns later he drops jedi luke and battles I lose something and capture him jail and retrieve. He then drops ben and a stick and the next turn I move iggy over and sniper with a rigged six capture ben and jail he ends up releasing him and I capture them again along with lando and ax so I capture wedge as well and he releases them again and we have a big battle at the dungeon where I get to imprision immeadiate so he has no chance of getting anyone out.  We realise that ben is a magician cause he is in two places at once db, and in jail. We agree that he keep ben down cause of all that went on with him. He gets omdh done and retrieves ten with it after that I get come here you big coward and battle again capture more of his characters and he tries to get a omdh done but I tell him of chybc and he moves back so he moves leia first then gets it done to get 4 back. he then moves tallon over to help her out. I then battle those two use 4lom to cancel tallon. shoot him draw destiny and capture them both.  He draws up cause hes run out of characters and cant retrieve so I win by 31.<br>
FW 8(+61)<br>
The Good: Capturing his characters and deck working again.<br>
The Bad: Letting him release ben and luke cause I had to capture them three times in the game<br>
The Ugly: chybc for him<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
My ls Vs Rodney Lees court<br>
He starts court and his effects are something special planned for them, power of the hutt and no bargain.  I wont go into detail cause this game was exceptionally long and not that interesting. We took about an hour an a bit longer busting our balls to get this win on our score cards. Basically I took over space and ended up losing control of it cause of stupid mistakes he ends up winning cause of my stupidity and he could have beaten me earlier cause my wys is a pile and I will not be playing it cause I dont like it!!!! I lose by 17<br>
FL 8(+44)<br>
The good: Taking over space<br>
The bad: Not reading the text of my Admirals order<br>
The ugly: Him taking too long to beat me and my stupid mistakes and the little war we had with nightfall.<br>
<br>
Well thats it and I end up coming fifth. Luca ends up going bad which is unusual for him and leigh the guy im trying to teach goes like 4(-101) or something like that although he did have a bye.<br>
