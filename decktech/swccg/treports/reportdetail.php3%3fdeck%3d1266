<br>
Alright, before we begin let me fill you in on the lead up.  We usually play at a coffee place called Java Z.  Unfortunately, when my friends and I arived half an hour before the tourney, it was closed, and it remained that way for 90 minutes.  Finally, our Tournament Director, Dion Erbes (Gold 102) secured a spot on the universty campus.  It was a weird start to the day<br>
   I&#146;m playing spaceport rops with bikerscouts running everywhere for dark, and incom corp EBO for light.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
My Rops vs. Joe Henke&#146;s revised Harvest deck<br>
<br>
This promises to be a fun matchup for both of us.  Joe is my friend and we have played against each other for over a year and a half.  He was playing a RTP deck but he switched about 5 days before this, so I didn&#146;t have a clue on what he was going with.  <br>
I ran with my usual start, Mob Points, IAO, and YCHF.  He started Obi&#146;s Hut and careful planning to get Lars&#146; house.  This was a TOTALLY non-interactive game from the very start.  I pulled Kuat, a Docking Bay and used my objective with a Scout on first turn and I flip on turn 3.  He gets out Owen and Beru early along with Tosche and the cantina.  Obi soon comes along.  Back on Ralltiir I&#146;m concentrating on building my drains.  First to come out was Imp commander and ETE on City, so I&#146;m draining for 7 with Scouts and backup.  Sim etc.  Meanwhile, he&#146;s harvesting away for four, figrin for 1, and draining for 2 so it is tight.  The turning point was when I got Overseeing it Personally down and after THREE turns of looking, sense.  I sensed a harvest, and drained him out in 2 turns.<br>
<br>
FW: 2 (+16)<br>
Highs: Playing a competive game and coming out on top<br>
Lows: No interaction and not packing Something Special Planned<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My EBO against Brett Severson<br>
<br>
Brett is a newbie, and another friend, but learns quick.  He was playing a CCT deck getting Iggy with gun.  My deck runs Suicide Mains, and so I&#146;m a little light on characters.  I end up giving him Chewie with gun.  I start of course with ANSB.  Right away things don&#146;t go good for him.  I get EBO going on turn 3 with a drain.  Meanwhile, he pulls ugnaughts and their leader with CCconsole.  His first attempt at frezzeing, he&#146;s adding nine, and draws a one.  That wasn&#146;t good.  By his second attempt, I&#146;m draining for seven with Mon Calamari, Kiffex, four x-wings, and Independence. I also got out HOTJ out so I only lose six when he did freeze the furball.  I drain him out in a couple turns while retriving 4 with All Wings and another couple life force with Traffic Control  <br>
<br>
FW: 2 +26<br>
    4 (+40)<br>
Highs: Winning, playing a sound game<br>
Lows: Again, No interaction.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
My light against Michael Raveling&#146;s (2000 something) dark.<br>
By this time I&#146;m third, and in the realm of the good people, where as of yet, I have no business being.  My rating is like, high 1400&#146;s.<br>
<br>
It was fun playing against Michael, and I thought it was cool playing against someone so good.  I&#146;m pretty sure he didn&#146;t have an objective.  If someone reads this that was there and thinks I&#146;m smoking crack, please correct me.  This game kind of went by in a blur.  He pulled mob points by prepared Defenses, and I&#146;m pretty sure, IA0 and Insignificant Rebellion.  This deck didn&#146;t really have a focus as far as I could see.  It was a counter deck that wasn&#146;t vulenerable against anything.  He used Mob to pull Executor, and started getting out Bays.  I used My Garrison to pull the pilots and get EBO going turn 3.  I deployed my first ship on turn five, we had been both drawing, and hoped to start draining.  I knew he still had Executor, but I thought I&#146;d be pretty safe with Incom and 3 x-wings.  Kiffex, light, got out first, and x-wings came down.  Executor came down after with help, and one x-wing survived to flee to Mon Cal, out of Executor&#146;s range.  Independence backed up the x-wing but by then the attention had shifted to ground.  I had deployed lando with gun and Fig, while he deployed 4-lom with canceler, Vader, Tarkin, and something else.  Anyway, he beat the crud out of me and Tagge Mara, and a scrub came down to finish me off, and cancel EBO.  Last ditch, I deployed Obi and Han with weapons to beat up the scurb, but he barriered oBi, added a destiny with Emp&#146;s power, and that was game.<br>
<br>
FL: 0 -23<br>
    4 (+17)<br>
Highs: Getting to play Michael, which was pretty cool, not getting totally smashed<br>
Lows: losing<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My dark vs. Scott Posters&#146; MWYHL test 1 asteroid sanctury deck.<br>
I start my usual and get two biker scouts, bikes, a Ral site, and Executor DB first turn, things are good.  He puts down a couple sites... WAIT! Grahm (sorry if misspelled) Neal and two others screw up the parings, so new ones, and I get to be With Drumroll, MICHAEL RAVELING.  Am I a lucky guy, or what?<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My dark vs. Michael&#146;s space drain rops killer.<br>
<br>
Well, this should be fun...He starts with Squadron Assignments, Insurrection, and something else, memory going slowly blank.  Location is Rendeszous Point, no Hidden Base.  I start the usual.  I get a look see through his deck early, lots of bays, pilots, planets, and ships.  I get 3 sites controled in a hurry, Cracken and Tala 1 show up at Ralltiir, soon to be joined by Red 7 and Tycho in ship while Tala moves off to LS coruscant.  Zuckuss in ship shows up at Ralltiir, flips, and draws a six, +3 =9 in attrition so Green Squad 3 and Tycho dies, but Zuckuss stays, although taking 4 damage.  I&#146;ll take the leader was out so ZiMH was only 2 power.  Chimaera comes down to help the fleet but got blasted apart, and that was pretty much game.  He drained for 5 or 6 in space while on ground my drains weren&#146;t working.  I was only getting like 3 or 4.<br>
<br>
FL: 0 -19<br>
    4 (-2)<br>
Highs: not much, maybe the 6 draw<br>
Lows: Playing Mike twice<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
My light vs. ?&#146;s (sorry) dark TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
This promised to be an fun game, and I believed it would be won by who got their drains set up first.  As it was, he had the slight edge, I thought in that race.  We both spent the first few turns setting up.  He was getting gas miners and combat cloud cars for some drains with Boba fett and weapon for backup.  I pulled my pilots, deployed Kiffex and Mon Calamari, and got Bacta Tank out with garrison.  That last move won the game for me.  I had got a signal and Han and Leia with weapons in my starting hand.  I considered deploying to cloud city, but held off.  I used the first signal for incom, and I drew up another one and pulled Menace Fades.  MF was my latest addition to my deck, and it was much needed.  Independence and 4 x-wings were draining at the 2 systems while he flipped and had Cloud City Occupation.  Han and Leia had come down to 4th marker to get MF in action so he only drained for 2, otherwise it was 7 minimum.  I was starting to pull ahead when Jodo, Iggy/gun and Bossk/gun came down to battle.  Everything depended on destiny draws.  He fired with Bossk, drew a 2 and missed everything.  I fired with leia, and Hit Bossk.  He then gave iggy a whirl at han but drew a 2 and missed.  I opted not to fire and we both drew our 2 destiny.  He drew a two and three, I drew Jedi Luke (6) and organized attack (5)  That cleared the site except for Leia and Han went to the tank.  Next turn Han came back with chewie to reinforce leia.  Finally choke vader makes a run at my hit crew.  He choked chewie, no tank.  I fire back once and miss horribly, drawing a 1.  That was again crucial.  He drew a 1 for destiny, My first was a zero.  (If I hadn&#146;t fired, I&#146;d have drawn a 1 and a 0)  As it was, I drew a five for the second one, and that was game.<br>
<br>
FW: 2 +23<br>
    6 + 21<br>
Highs: Winning, drains, Bacta Tank, and Destiny draws<br>
Lows: Nothing<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
This is our last game if you&#146;re getting bored or tired.  It was my dark against Peter Jacobsen&#146;s Docking Bay light.<br>
<br>
This was close from start to finish.  He got out Wise Advice, Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Obi&#146;s hut. I pulled the usual, except for YCHF switching for decree.  I flipped late, turn 4, with a only 2 force first turn, and only FIVE second.  I was draining for 3, while he pulled DBs and deployed Tawss Khaa, Leia/gun and Annie&#146;s saber, Luke with his stick, and Obi with his, you guessed it, stick.  He was draining for 1 early, and I 3 with Rops flipped.  He tranisited over his guys, using LS spaceport DB, I had dropped mine in fear of this.  He also put out Order to Engage.  Choke vader came down to join Mara, a scout and bike and Tempest 1, and battled.  I tried to Choke Tawss, and draw Empy for success.  He fires back, misses vader.  Mara hits leia, and he hits vader on the second try.  After destinies he won by a couple.  Igar came down on Tempest and there were more battles, with me slowly getting my forces killed.  I had got Onith and Barquin out and was trying to use them every chance I got, but he kept drawing huge hands and only won Barquin a little over half the time.  I&#146;m draining for 3, he 4, and there&#146;s about 6 min. left.  Here&#146;s where It got weird.  I have 2 scouts running around evading luke and ben and a lone orrimarko, while draining for as much as they can.  I got Janus down to DB 94 and moved over to Obi&#146;s hut for a drain of 3.  It&#146;s like dead even.  Here&#146;s where I made my mistake.  Instead of moving the Biker scouts over to occupy ben and luke&#146;s site.  I left them so the jedi got a drain of 3, instead of no drain, and my forfiet of 11 minimum would have covered, the loss.  I tranisited over Onith and D&#146;an to Endor DB for a drain of 1. Orri then got to Janus&#146;s site<br>
and he tried to sense his own OTE to get the sense back in life force.  He caught himself, and asked if I wanted him to take back the move.  I told him no, because I had just moved Janus over for a new drain, and I would have died from OTE.  I lost in a timed game by 4.  (4 force to 3)<br>
<br>
TL: 0 -4<br>
    6 +17<br>
Highs: playing a close game with lots of battles<br>
Lows: losing a close one<br>
<br>
In the end Michael won, and Grahm, Josh Wiitanen and Josh Kohman toke 2,3, and 4.  I tied in score with 2 others at 6<br>
+17, but since I had the 2nd biggest win, 24, of us I took 8th and not 7th or 9th.<br>
<br>
Props: Dion, finding us a place to play.  The place itself, Burger King, Pool tables, an arcade, and a bowling alley.  <br>
