It's hard to imagine, but I was actually feeling pressure going into this one.  In the few years that the open has been held in San Diego, not a single defending champion did any better than 4-2 the next year.  It was my goal to change that.  <br>
<br>
	As you all know, decks were an issue for everyone.  Death Star II being released on Wednesday put a damper on everyones well layed out plans.  So, after buying my four boxes and going through cards all that day, I decided that the best route to go would be with a couple of good old fasion balanced battle decks. <br>
<br>
	 I knew exactly what I was going to do for light.  It was just a matter of changing a few cards in my pre-existing Throne Room Mains deck.  I replaced Jerren Webb with Lt. Blount.  Red Leader in Red 1 was replaced by Home One.  Home One war room took the place of the Yavin IV war room, and Honor of the Jedi replaced one of the sences. <br>
<br>
	For those of you who don't know the power of Honor of the Jedi, here's a brief list of what your missing.  Unless your opponent occupies 3 battlegrounds it cancels the effects of :  Visage, Occupation, Do or do not...if your playing SAC, and First Strike.  It also acts as Come Here You Big Coward by reducing those pesky force drains at non-battlegrounds by 2.  Other direct damage cards that are reduced are Pride of the Empire, and even 3,720 to 1 is reduced by 2.  I'm sure that I am missing a few more, but I think that I've justified that card going into almost every light side deck out there.  <br>
	<br>
	For a dark deck, I really had no idea what I wanted to do.  I knew what I should do, and that was Ralltiir, but I'd never had any kind of success with it at all.  Kevin Shannon had put one together the week before for the ENDURO.  (I know, I still owe you guys a Tournament Report for that one) and he did very well with it.  I was impressed on how it was able to dominate the local EBO meta.  So, Kevin calls me on Wednesday night and asks me what to do for light.  While at the same time, I'm asking him about dark.  So, in a round about way, we just convinced eachother to go with eachothers decks.  With all the new fun imperials, and the Emperor, RalOps was the way to go.  (P.S.  Please hold off on requests for a decklist.  Our regional is this next weekend and I don't want to have to face too many versions of the KevClay RalOps deck, or the ClayKev TR Mains deck)<br>
<br>
	No near fatalities on this years roadtrip.  The only bummer was that it took almost 3 hours just to get from LA to San Diego on the 405.  Wassup wit that??<br>
<br>
	Thursday night we finally get to our hotel room and everyone is starving.  I am too, but I've still got a dark deck to make.  Everyone goes and grubs at the Spaghetti Factory except myself and Jason Makahon.   I get it built in about an hour and then I start playtesting it against Jason.  It wins 3 out of 4 against Elom hell.  This is very encouraging because the eloms don't face all the deploy bonus's that a mains and toys deck would, and I was still able to get through it.  In the middle of one of our games, everyone gets back with a full belly. If you've never eaten at a Factory, do yourself a favor and go.  The bread alone is worth it.   A few minutes later, Kevin calls from the airport and needs a ride to the room to avoid the 30 dollar taxi fair.  Brett Nottingham, and Eric and Jeff Field go pick him up.  When they get back, I hand the RalOps to Kevin.  We spend the next few hours teching it out and playtesting it against everyone who wanted to play.  We were sure of one of two things.....It was either the best dark deck we could possibly make, or everyones light side sucked so bad that it didn't matter.  For ego's sake, we convinced ourselves that it was a great dark deck.  <br>
<br>
	The next morning Kevin, Eric, and myself go for some grub and walk over to the convention center together.  We got there about an  hour early, which meant that we had way to much time to think about our decks.  Kevin and I made some minor changes at that time, but all in all we stayed with what we had.  Juz walks in right after us and comes over and looks at my decks.  He gives a little smile and asks if I'm ready to defend my title.  I smile back, and re-introduce him to Kevin.  They met at DragonCon, but I wanted to make sure that Justin knew who he was.  &quot;Kevin, this is Justin, Justin, this is Kevin Shannon.  If I don't win it, he is my pick to take it all this year.&quot; (yeah, I predicted it........just ask Juz)  A few minutes later Kyle H walk up to me and says &quot;you know that a lot of people are predicting you to win this one.&quot;  As if I don't feel enough pressure.........geeez!!<br>
<br>
	Theres about a half an hour to go still and I'm up at the control desk talking to Nhat Lai.  Then I notice Gary Carmen walk in.  Talk about unexpected.  (last years world champ for those of you who don't know) Gary had just flown in to watch the open, and he'd brought Michael Riboulet with him on this trip.   A small group of us stand around and talk tech for the next half an hour or so, until they start getting things organized for the eventual start. <br>
<br>
	This year, instead of shouting out the match ups, they posted them up on the board.  Saves time......yes, but in my opinion it takes away from a lot of the personality of the huge events.  You know, hearing the early tough match ups and listening to the participants go Oooooooo.   Hell, I didn't even realize that Tim Guzman was there until someone had told me after game 5.  Now finally, off to the games.<br>
<br>
	Game 1: Dark vs James Floydd's new light objective speeder deck<br>
	Everone says that you've got to be lucky as well as good.  This game proved it.  James spread out with sand and snow speeders early and avoided beatdowns with Its a traps.  He got out Manuvering Flaps early, so I had to play very cautious.  I captured luke with epp Vader and moved into the Hutt with him to avoid any speeder beatdown.  He was outdraining me 5-2 early, and was Figrin'ing every turn to get one back.  The game turned when he made a mistake and forgot that he had to pay extra for General Solo on Raltiir. (+2 because of the objective and +2 because of bad feeling)  I barriered him, and so he didn't have enough force to come at me with the 5 or so speeders that were in his hand.  I got out my 4th &lt;&gt; site, deployed to it, moved a few characters and flipped.  Game was mine from there on as his drains suddenly went down to 1.  Putting Zuchuss in MH at Kashyyyk sealed it as I was hitting him for 6 a turn in drains.  Full Win by 12   2 (+12)<br>
<br>
	The Good:  Winning a game that I probobly shouldn't have<br>
	The Bad:  I won, what bad could there be??<br>
	The Ugly:  Juz, Gary, and Michael watched most of my game.  I probobly gave a very crappy first impression to Michael.  I made some stupid mistakes early which should have cost me.  <br>
<br>
	Game 2: Light vs James Bottomley's Set your course Manipulater<br>
	I was very worried about this game.  James had gone undefeated with this deck a few weeks prior and it was very sound.  He gets out all of his docking bays on the first turn with the DS docking bay control center, so he's activating for BOOKOO.  I put luke and a h'mneth at the CC docking bay and begin draining.  He gets jacked for characters early and he can't find Miyoon at all.  I wax him in a couple of battles and make a very quick game of it.  Full Win by 32  4(+44)<br>
<br>
	The Good:  Playing a near perfect game.  It was so quick that I had time to go get some grub.<br>
	The Bad:  Taking out a friend<br>
	The Ugly:  I notice that Kevin is playing Todd a couple of tables behind me.  Touch early matches suck.  We need to constitue the Newbie rule until game 3. &lt;wink&gt;<br>
<br>
	Game 3:  Light vs Patrick &quot;Julio&quot; Garcia's RalOps<br>
	Patrick and I played eachother in last years team event and had a blast.  I love playing the people from the San Diego area.  They are there to have fun.  Anyways, to the game.  I get Luke and a H'mneth to his jungle 2nd turn, with Goo Ney Tay.  He just got choked.  I was activating for over 18 by the 6th turn to his 6-8.  So, everywhere that he went to, I went to with double the power and waxed him.  Another quick game with the light side.  Full win by 28   6(+72)<br>
<br>
	The Good:  It was a fun game.  He called me &quot;skip&quot; the whole time.  &quot;The force is with you skip.&quot; While I was calling him Julio. Gary watched this whole game.  I think I redeamed my honor with the Brits.  <br>
	The Bad:  None<br>
	The Ugly:  The prices of hot dogs were outrageous!!<br>
<br>
	Game 4: Dark vs DJ Pierazek's Profit.<br>
	I was able to flip on the 2nd turn while he was just stacking characters at the Audience Chamber.  The Emperor makes his presence felt with Overseeing It Personally.  So my drains on Ralltiir just doubled.  I was hitting him for 7 a turn to his 1 from his objective.  He comes to Ralltiir to battle and gets barriered.  Next turn I come down with a hoard of walkers and thrash him.  Full Win by 21  8(+93)<br>
<br>
	The Good: DJ and I have traded cards online for the past couple of years.  It was cool to finally meet him.  Kevin is still undefeated.  He took out the 97 ComicCon champ Evan Ferguson.  <br>
	The Bad:  Thrashing him.  He didn't have a chance.<br>
	The Ugly:  I'm wanting another 5 dollar soda already<br>
<br>
	Game 5: Dark vs Steve Greenburg's Docking bay Stuff<br>
	Leave it to Steve to come up with some crazy stuff.  He starts with Endor system and 3 effects.  The one that lets you pull a general twice per game, and makes it so I don't activate at the endor system was one of them.  So, he pulls Nadine I think, and puts him up at a docking bay.  Uses his gametext and grabs a scout every turn. (very mean stuff) He keeps putting these scrubs at DB's and makes his activation absolutely HUGE.  Then he starts Revolutioning my stuff.  (WTH?)  I have to save for a few turns to get some force, but I finally get enough going to flip my objective.  Steve had the force, but just didn't have the beats early to keep me from flipping.  So, every turn for a while, I used 2 force during my control phase to grab an alter.  It was slow, but I eventually got rid of his revolutions.  One of which cause a huge beatdown at my docking bay where he had planted a random scrub.  Once the choke was gone, I set up the Emperor with Overseeing it Personally, and stuck Zuckuss in MH at Kashyyyk to eventually drain him out.  Full win by 19  10(+112)<br>
<br>
	The Good:  A tough win against a world finalist.  Steve is one of the great deckbuilders out there.  Never expect the usual when playing him.  Kevin won again also, taking out Greg Miller.  <br>
	The Bad:  I'm in first place now.  I can feel the target on my back. <br>
	The Ugly: I find out shortly that Kevin and I are the top 2.  Damn, I wanted Kevin in the final.  Oh well.  <br>
<br>
	Game 6: Light vs Kevin Shannon's KevClay RalOps deck<br>
	We both know that he should win this 8 out of 10.  The only shot I have is to go to him early and cause some damage.  He puts a random scrub at his executer docking bay first turn, but doesn't get any Ralltiir locations.  Very smart.  He knows that I'd take over on his planet early, so he's not giving me anywhere to go until he's ready.  I got a bothan spy in my opening hand, but wait until my 2nd turn to go thrash the scrub with the spy and Orimmaarko.  He loses a few cards, but it was the jump I needed.  He bides his time and gets everything set up in his hand.  Then in one turn, he lays it all down and flips.  My drains are suddenly gone, while he's adding to his destinies everywhere now.  Its all uphill for me from then on.  I do some battle damage here and there, and hit him with uncontrollable fury for about 12 cards, but in the end it wasn't enough.  Full Loss by 8  10(+104)<br>
	<br>
	The Good: If I'm going to lose to anyone, I'm glad that its Kevin.  <br>
	The Bad:  James Lafferty won by enough to sneak over me and play Kevin for this years title.  You'd think that +104 would be enough wouldn't you?<br>
	The Ugly:  I can't complain at all.  I won this event last year, won the state championship, and took 3rd at this years ComicCon.  Not bad for a scrub huh?<br>
<br>
	As you all know by now, Kevin thrashed James in the final winning with our dark by 26, and with our light by 18.  It really makes me feel proud that my best bud in the game finally is going to get the recognition that he deserves.  I know that he'll do great at DecipherCon<br>
<br>
	Mad Props go to:  Kevin of course.<br>
<br>
	The bread at the Spaghetti Factory<br>
<br>
	Gary Carmen and Michael Riboulet for some damn funny stories.<br>
<br>
	Juz for running a very smooth tournament.  <br>
<br>
	James Lafferty just for being himself.  Truely one of the great guys in the game.  The kids absolutely adorable man.  Congratulations.<br>
<br>
	Mad Slops go to:  Whoever the moron was who decided to run a DSII/Endor sealed deck in the middle of the Open.<br>
<br>
	Decipher for the lack of prize support.  WE NEED TO BRING BACK THE GLASS.  There is definately a sence of pride when your carrying around a coaster that says  &quot;yadda place finish 2000 San Diego ComicCon.&quot;  I've got a few, but think about the newer players who are striving for some glory.  I know that its a weak argument that someone needs a piece of plastic to feel good about themselves, but its the truth.  Give back the Glass so the people have something to show, rather than just having a sence of accomplishment.  <br>
<br>
	Decipher once again.  WHERES MY BINDER??  Has any of the state/province champions received their booby prize yet??  just curious<br>
<br>
	For those of you who are still reading, I hope you enjoyed it.  I had a great time and I'm looking forward to next years open down there.  Until next time....PEACE!!<br>
