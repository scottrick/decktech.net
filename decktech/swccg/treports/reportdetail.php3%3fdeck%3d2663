Sorry for taking my sweet @#$% time with this, I play Everquest so my time dissipates like bags of Fritos left by my bed.  I would also like to make a comment to one of my last reviews.  I don&amp;#8217;t like to name names, but someone mentioned that they didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy my TR because I don&#146;t explains @#$% to you move for move, or highlight the finer points of the game.  Well all I have to say is suck it, eat it, you tea bagging whore ; P  I Write this @#$% for entertainment not to teach people, or enlighten them with Colorado tech.  If you want that track my @#$% down and knock on my door, I&amp;#8217;d love to talk tech.  But these are for entertainment.  So I really hope these are humorous, I know I have people read these, so someone must think I&amp;#8217;m doing something right.  Anyways enjoy the show!<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And so it goes, and so it goes.  And so will you soon I suppose.<br>
<br>
Prologue:  I felt rather confident that my two decks that took Day One were ready for Day 2.  My goal today was not  first, I just want the damn bye into day two at Worlds.  That was the goal for the weekend.  So again bring Pods, Profit, and @#$%es along with my Mr. Garrison Deck (Name Changed, but the story stays the same).  Mark that I did not stay up all night, I did sleep this night, hell I even had a real breakfast with Tom Meade and his Mother.  We roll to the Mania at like 9:15am and I am greeted by my play testing bud John Arendt who gives me props on the DS2 set and tells me he&amp;#8217;s playing today.  We chat for a bit while my friends franticly make deck lists.  The most interesting thing about the pre-tourney is that Masta Kyle Craft walks in directly out of his Summer Camp where he is a Councilor (I shudder to think).  Kyle comes in, sits down, declares that he has not seen any of the new cards, nor are they built yet, and then promptly announces he&amp;#8217;s making Hayes Hunter Decks.  Gotta love the minerals on this kid.  Anyways Brian Shows up, so we got the three best playas in our region and additionally the Circle of Jesus is now Complete . . . And we all know what happens  afterwards . . . .<br>
<br>
Joe Helfrich is running this show along with Gaeta as his second.  We get started at 10am, we have a measly 39 people here (States was like 50-60?) with people from CO, AZ, UT.  <br>
<br>
Game 1 Jeff Thompson (1560) Endor Operations Non-Flipper vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es<br>
Jeff is from Arizona, so I think I will continue my Arizona beat down.  Since I went 2-0 Against Arizona yesterday I think it&amp;#8217;s all good.  Jeff&amp;#8217;s deck is truly a classic piece of scrubdom.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t really do anything to me.  I&amp;#8217;m real iffy if he gave me Aliens to beat down.  All I remember is that we both kept to our own tactics.  I just win the Pod race and Release Han and piss on him with direct damage.  And he plays some mains on Endor and drains.  There was no real reason for me to ever want to come to Endor, since he wasn&amp;#8217;t using anything `to make me lose force.  However he would try to step to, on Tatooine and I would beat him down with my mains.  A very standard Profit game, and furthermore a very standard 1st round scrub game.  Hum, Full win for me +26.<br>
<br>
Highs: Starting off with a solid win and differential.  <br>
Lows: Not remembering the finer details and specifics plays and tactics of this game, I&amp;#8217;m real sorry ; )<br>
<br>
Game 2 Michael Girard (1792) Lingrell&amp;#8217;s RST vs. Mr. Garrison<br>
Will the Arizona Beats continue?  Girard is ready to lay down he revenge upon me, and I&amp;#8217;m ready for it, but I don&amp;#8217;t want revenge to come today.  So we begin the play.  I start off I get the Admiral Merrejick action pretty quickly.  I think I have a good shot at this game cause I must have play tested this match up like 7 times against John Arendt, so I know what to do.  As usual it is ignore the LS and stick to DD, and Garrison Drain.  However Mike doesn&amp;#8217;t believe in sticking to his own strategy . . . Very smart.  He decided to drop Blount and EPP Ben to my DB to take tare of the Admiral/Commander Combo.  He comes down slices one and I draw horrendous Destiny, aka a 3.  So I lose my System Grabber, and EPP Ben sits on my DB.  I didn&amp;#8217;t have Hoth  out yet, that is not good.  I need the force so I actually play Fondor from my hand, but I don&amp;#8217;t have the force to drop the Executor.  On Girard&amp;#8217;s turn he drops some Jank LS Ship to Fondor, so awesome, I can&amp;#8217;t Play the Executor.  The only thing that&amp;#8217;s going right is that Mike is drawing Terrible Race Destiny And I Used Grimtaashed him real early.  At this point I still have not Deployed a single @#$%ing walker to Hoth, aka I sill haven&amp;#8217;t drawn one.  However it makes no difference I need space for this deck.  So I come down on his jank ship with Zuckuss followed by the Executor.  Hey!  So I beat him out of space, I then draw and get Hoth, however no Walkers.  I did have Battle Deployment though.  So on  his turn he gets ready to blow up the bunker, but I still get a turn to prepare.  On my turn I Deploy Igar in a Non-Unique to the 6th marker Cheap and move to the 5th.  I then Prepare for the forthcoming explosion.  On his turn I lose 8 force, he gets 8 and I manipulate my hand back to my used pile.  On my next turn he wins his Podrace . . . His deck actually working?! What the Hell, so I lose 6 off the top since I have no hand, I then draw some cards to get more walkers.  He begins to spread out and Drain on Endor and I begin to deploy Walkers, or what&amp;#8217;s left of them ASAP and try to spread out.  Its all too late though.  After he gets cards out to deal with the Battle Order He&amp;#8217;s Draining for 6 and that is bad.  I do get off a Garrison in my last breath, and if I had another Turn I could have played another Garrison and ended him.  But Girard was able to kill me.  Although I lost by 15 I fell just short of beating him . . . By a turn.  Although I had the worst walker draw of all times, I will not put the game on that,  Mike really made some brilliant plays early on to get me out of my normal strategy.  So my hat is off to him this time ; ) Full Loss -15<br>
<br>
Highs: Its nice to lose to a classy player like Girard, but then again losing don&amp;#8217;t feel too good anyway you look at it.  <br>
Lows: This is my first loss this weekend . . . Bah!  <br>
<br>
So I am not even close to the lead after the first round.  So this means I need to win my next 4 games.  And hopefully an early loss will keep me out of the uber winner&amp;#8217;s circle.  Cause I really don&amp;#8217;t feel like facing John, Brian, or Kyle right now.  So I can hope this goes my way.<br>
<br>
Game 3 Joseph Schlageck (1395) MKOS Abyssians vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es.  <br>
I read somewhere that this match up is an Auto-win?  I think that&amp;#8217;s true.  And it is.  I start the camp for Tail gunner Joe here and I think he gives me Jabba and Myo in the Chamber ; )  There really isn&amp;#8217;t too much to say here, I screw him on force, I make his @#$% deploy +32543276912 and I proceed to beat down?  Details?  Well he did give me No Bargain, that can&amp;#8217;t be good for me.  On the 4th turn I deploy Padme (Republican), Qui-Gon (Master Jedi), and JPP Lando (Alien) into his AC and beat him down.  I then Free Han. Play the Cantina, he invades Cantina with Myo and an Abyssian.  I then play Ben Kenobi w/ Stick and Jedi Luke there.  I battle I slice an Abyssian and play Gift of the Mentor . . . I drew a 6, 6, and a 3.  Lets do some math . . . 15+11 = 26-7 = you lose the game Scrub ; )  Full Win +34<br>
<br>
Highs: The Ben/Luke Beats, The Republic @#$% You MKOS Beats, awwww hell it was all goooood!<br>
Lows: Beating him down so bad that it was embarrassing.<br>
<br>
Lunch Break:  Me and Jeremy Gray go get some pizza at Pudge Brotha&amp;#8217;s pizza across the way and we both drink some big @#$% Mountain Dew&amp;#8217;s.  John Arendt joins us and we talk tech.  He tell us that he just lost to Brian Hunter DS deck.  When John told me that it was MKOS Tatooine Occupation I began to drool because that match up would be pimp for me.  But that&amp;#8217;s even if I would get matched up with Brian Hunter being 3-0 hmmmmm.  The weather outside is hotter than the Pizza I am eating so lunch was kinda weak soup.  But Dew is goooood!!<br>
<br>
Game 4 Brain Hunter (n + 2300) Flipping Hidden Mains Done RIGHT vs. Mr. Garrison<br>
Sweeeet!!  I did not want to play Brian with a deck that he knows how to play, and where it is weak.  Furthermore I did not want to play Brian because he was holding the new uber Immediate Effect Brian Hunter&amp;#8217;s Fury.  Game text reads as such . . . <br>
<br>
Play if Brian Hunter has just lost a tournament.   Brian Hunter is now power + 6, is immune to Rating &lt;2000 and Kyle Craft&amp;#8217;s Trash.  If the person he is playing this round is from Colorado add 10 to total differential every game.  (Immune to Control) <br>
<br>
Hum this does not bode well for me.  So the game opens up with both our solid starts.  I get DB play the butt buddies and get systems and play the Executor, hell I even get Thrawn and the Chimmy.  However Brian gets to play his General Calrissian in Falcon to Endor, and he pulls all his other beat down fools.  He spreads out Flips.  This wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so bad if I had Walkers on Hoth, but you know how the deck is doing today , maybe the Gnomes from South Park took all my Walkers . . . Step One Walkers, Step Two . . . , Step 3 Profit?  Either way its going bad for me.  I don&amp;#8217;t even have Battle Plan out to make him pay for drains so he just Drains away, and let me tell you I am so very afraid of his Power Pivot that I don&amp;#8217;t even try to leave to go probe.  When he played OTE it just got worse.  Basically he had total advantage in space.  He had the Bacta Tank, he had Menace Fades Up, with Ben at the Forest on Tibrin.  Basically he took away all my ability to control space, and when Mr. Garrison can&amp;#8217;t control space , he can&amp;#8217;t get gay with drains.  Hence I look like a stooge in this game, being outplayed by the Masta of Disasta!  Full Loss by 23 ( @#$% kicking on the dot!) I would also like to say how good this deck is that Brian has made.  It is able to deal with my big blue effectively enough, and I&amp;#8217;m sure will eat through most any ISB, SYCFA, BHBM space packages just as well too.  Although this deck was made to piss on Hunt Down like none other, it is also an amazingly good space deck.  I say this because I think it got some bad reviews on Decktech, granted there was review by Clint Hayes which means absolutely nothing but still : )<br>
<br>
Highs: Hey so Brian has taken his revenge that means everything is ok, right?  <br>
Lows: I&amp;#8217;m now out of contention for the final confrontation, I know look like a potzer sitting on a corner.<br>
<br>
I really don&amp;#8217;t give 2 @#$%s about what&amp;#8217;s going on now.  Brian is 4-0 and kicking much ass.  I&amp;#8217;m 2-2, Tom Meade is like 1-3, Jeremy Gray is like 2-2, Tom Kathman is 2-2 . . . Basically the people I play with in Northern Colorado are getting worked.  Now I&amp;#8217;m just playing so I can get my Rebel Barrier Foil ; )<br>
<br>
Game 5 Danny Hummel (1648) QMC vs. Mr. Garrison<br>
I don&amp;#8217;t remember too much about this game due to the fact I repress the memories of terrible games.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember details but I can sum up what happened in this game.  Basically I did my normal start with Garrison . . .as usual getting no Walkers  (I run 6 for @#$%s sake?).  I start to take Space but Danny become unrealities in trying to contest Bespin.  He keeps playing @#$% over and over.  I even have Red Squadron 1 w/ a lateral on it.  But I do not get access to either Battle Plan or Imperial Decree.  Why is this bad?  Because Danny is playing Gay cards like Pucimir Tyress to add to his Drains on CC.  And Decree sucks because he has aliens so he drains for un modified 3&amp;#8217;s.  Even if I did get Battle plan into play He still had some space so He didn&amp;#8217;t have to pay.  Basically It took me the whole damn game to get him OUT of space.  When that happened he lost his Menace Fades, and I got my Battle Plan.  I was then Able to drop the Garrison bomb on him.  When I had 2 left in my deck he only had 2 cards in his deck so he could not drain me.  So I had a full win by 2 . . . @#$%ing 2 cards.  So Mr. Garrison went  2 -26 today.  This means its time to pull that deck out and piss on it, grrrrrrr!!!!<br>
<br>
Highs: @#$% that, although I won this was just a terrible terrible game for me. Almost getting worked by a Parker scrub is sooooo not good.<br>
Lows: I don&amp;#8217;t even want to acknowledge my deck existence after today, 1-2 is just unacceptable!<br>
<br>
After years of waiting, nothing has changed.  Brian is still kicking @#$% at 5-0.  And I get to scrub out still.  If I wine by 35 I Might be able to get in the top 8.  With Profit I think I can.<br>
<br>
Game 6 Patrick Napier (1729) Power Deal vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es<br>
Patrick is from Colorado Springs, and he is one of the better players from that city so this should be a good game.  I can&amp;#8217;t remember if I started Ultimatum or Goo Nee Tay this game.  Basically this game is easy.  WE both ignore each other&amp;#8217;s tactics . . . Makes sense right  it&amp;#8217;s the post Tatooine tactic!!!  So he ignores me and I win the Podrace and Pop Han quickly.  He plays his power mains to CC, slowly.  So I spread out on Tatooine to satisfy my Ultimatum when the Power Drains Occur so I don&amp;#8217;t hurt as much.  I myself begin to power Drain on Tatooine with Sticks and DD.  It takes him an eternity to set up the deal, mostly to bad luck with getting his cards for his deck with the 0 side.  On his last turn he does the dirty deeds for about 11 when he only had one force left in his deck.  Grrrr, so that brings my diff down to 18, Full Win for me.  Would have been 29, and that might have gotten me into the top 8, but I digress, I don&amp;#8217;t even deserve a Trophy for today&amp;#8217;s performance.<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning my last game, My Profit Deck has still only lost one game, that one belonging to John Arendt!<br>
Lows: Knowing that I already lost the whole show.  It sucks to play after you know that you have no Chance.<br>
<br>
So in the end Brian was 6-0 and Justin Beals (Who I beat the day before) was 5-1.  So these are the two players that are going to get a bye into day 2. Grats, you better both go!!!  Brian ends up winning the Final Confrontation . . . So he gets the bigger piece of plastic.  I was 8 +42 which was 11th place bah! I did better at states.  I get 4 packs and Rebel Barrier Foil as prize support.  Then the best ever.  Gaeta has amassed up a sick collection of killer foils that he&amp;#8217;s gonna raffle out to all of us.  So he throws out UR foils and Tournament foils and @#$%, he than says there is a random Mara Jade Foil and I declare &amp;#8220;Hey I need that for my set&amp;#8221;, and then my name is called, kick ass!!!  My projective telepathy classes at www.learntobeajedi.com are starting to kick in. So now I am up a Set of DS2, Foil Mara, and a foil Rebel Barrier.  So far thus has been a more than worthwhile weekend.  <br>
<br>
After the tournament we go back to the Hotel, eat some cheesy poofs, then me and Tom Meade go to see Steve Spielberg&amp;#8217;s new movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence.  Good flick, by the way.  Afterwards we come back to the hotel, I swim in some chlorine infested waters and then go back to room and watch some 6 feet under on HBO and then go to sleep to get ready for Day 3&amp;#8217;s team tournament.  <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Gaeta: Again for hosting a cool tournament, and handing out UR foils as door prizes . . . Kick ass!<br>
Brian Hunter: Grats on an extremely well played day.  <br>
Justin Beals: I had no idea that after beating him yesterday that he would be sitting in the final confrontation for the WQ.  Good Job.<br>
Kyle Craft: The Minerals on this kid to show up blind for this shindig, see ya this fall!<br>
John Arendt and Josh Bader: For preparing me for this day, we did the best we could.<br>
Jeremy Gray: Played Rescue the Princess in a Colorado WQ, BALLS!<br>
My Opponents: For all being good.<br>
Pods, Profit, and @#$%es: This is my favorite deck since Massassi  Mains ; ) 15-1 baby!<br>
Random Quick Stop w/ Mountain Dew: For having Mountain Dew!<br>
Joe Helfrich: For Judging!<br>
Van and McConnell: For not showing up and dropping after you lost your first 2 games!<br>
Mara Jade and Rebel Barrier Foil: For looking so cool!<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
Me: For having a horrendous performance after the 4-0 Friday night.  I lost to two quality players and I really didn&amp;#8217;t beat anybody to brag about.  I am admitting this now, and I am quite aware of the situation.<br>
Alex form Greeley: Nuff Said!<br>
Mr. Garrison: Ass, @#$%. @#$%lick, tits, @#$%, ass, @#$% lick, @#$%-@#$%, @#$% DECK #99  <br>
Brian Hunter&amp;#8217;s Fury: This card is broken.<br>
Chris Fanchi: Nuff Said!<br>
Clint Hayes: Calling me some random fool on Hunter&amp;#8217;s HB flipper review, ya @#$% you buddy!<br>
Decipher Computer Program: For pairing me with Brian Hunter in Game 4, I will not forgive you!<br>
<br>
Of course I&amp;#8217;d like to sit around and chat. <br>
Of course I&amp;#8217;d like to stay and chew the fat.<br>
