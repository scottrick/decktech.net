<br>
A report of our 6 game monthly tournament that is held at DJs Comics in Meriden, CT. This is usually run by Jeremy Oakes, but he was in the Big City for a Jedi Knights demonstration, so Charlie Hoffman ran the show. <br>
<br>
For this tourney, we had 20 players. Here are the results:<br>
1  Steve Brentson 10 +79<br>
2  Andrew Ledwith 10 +53<br>
3  Greg West 9 +113<br>
4  Brian Hollingworth 8 +43<br>
5  Karl Sundberg 8 +42<br>
6  Steven Vallee 8 +13<br>
7  Sean Orcutt 7 (-8)<br>
8  John Mendes 6 +41<br>
9  James Carron 6 +29<br>
10 Keith Henderson 6 +6<br>
11 Brian Henderson 6 (-11)<br>
12 Joe Kohlisch 6 (-15)<br>
13 Michael Mosher 5 (-7)<br>
14 Patrick Gstell 4 (-13)<br>
15 Anthony Muscaro 4 (-20)<br>
16 Tom Hollingworth 4 (-41)<br>
17 Danny Peixinho 4 (-47)<br>
18 Andrew Snelling 4 (-59)<br>
19 Pat Long 2 (-81)<br>
20 Dan Long 0 (-117)<br>
<br>
My dark deck was an ISB with lots of blue along with a mixture of ORS and destiny 3 Imperial ISB agents. I use DB&amp;#8217;s to generate force with Mobilization Points and can battle or force drain.<br>
<br>
My light deck was a speeders deck inspired by Speeders Anonymous and tweaked to my area meta.  I use a MPG and North Ridge start to protect my Hoth Docking Bay and Incom Corporation. I use Insurrection and Staging Areas to pull docking bays and generate force. <br>
<br>
Game One: my DS against Patrick (Can I buy a vowel, Pat &amp; Vanna?) Gstell and his LS EBO.<br>
<br>
Patrick and I never seem to get to play against each other, so I was looking forward to this game. Patrick is always looking for sneaky combos to surprise people.<br>
<br>
He starts with A New Secret Base and I put down my usual Mob Points, IAO, &amp; Oppressive Enforcement. In my opening hand, I draw Den of Thieves and Secret Plans so I am feeling good about this game since EBO deck are draining decks and I have plenty of ORS to put down on the DOT. For the first turn, Patrick puts down two Echo Base sites and I put down a DB. The second turn, he puts down two systems and I take a chance and deploy an Imp ISB with an ORS at two DBs to flip my objective. Now Patrick pulls Squadron Assignments and EB Garrison and deploys Leia w/blaster and Hobbie to one of the DBs to battle a pair of ISB. He shoots and hits my ORS and I draw a destiny of 5 to his 3. He loses Leia and I lose both agents to leave Hobbie by himself. Now I come down with Tempest 1 and an ORS pilot to battle Hobbie. He loses Hobbie and another 5 cards. On the next turn, he deploys Home 1 with Lt Blount to Coruscant to flip me back. I come back and first deploy one Vic SD to Coruscant. Then I put down the AO We Are In Attack Position Now to allow me to drop another Vic SD along with Admiral Thrawn and 2 ORS pilots. After destinies, I won 28-13 and he loses Home 1 and Blount. I was immune to his DD and flipped my objective back. Next he deploys an A-wing, a scrub, and Luke to three echo sites along with EBO flipped. I drop two walkers with pilots at the North ridge and for the rest of the game it was a drain race with my canceling a big drain with DOT and slowing down others by having an ISB. As time was closing, he decides to spread out to block my drains and I have two quick battles to end the game for a full win.  <br>
FW +13<br>
<br>
Props: Patrick for a close game<br>
<br>
Game Two: my LS against Pat Long and his Agents of the Black Sun<br>
<br>
As usual I get the chance to play a member of the Long family. I have not seen a Black Sun deck so I did not know what to expect.<br>
<br>
He starts with Any Methods Necessary and I use Insurrection, Staging Areas, and the combo Do or do not/Wise Advice. I thought that he would have the Emperor and might have SAC attack.<br>
<br>
Our first turns had him putting down a prison and get Incom Corp at the Hoth DB. Turn two, he drops Jodo Kast with a blaster and binders to the North Ridge. I come down with 5 Rebel  Speeders, he shoots one of the speeders and I win the battle 18-3. He loses Jodo and 10 cards. A few turns later, he has The Emperor, Vigo, and Xizor at the Imperial Square. I attack the Imperial square with Lt Blount, Luke JK and his stick, and 2 Speeders with Flaps on. I win 23-14 and he forfeits all 3 cards to let me clear out the Square for only the loss of 1 speeder. I had two speeders at the Tatooine DB and he drops Snoova, Jodo, IG-88 w/Blaster and Boba Fett  to battle me, he shoots a Speeder and I lose 25-13. I forfeit the other speeder and he loses Boba. I come down with 4 speeders to battle and win 22-16. He drops another BH at the DB and on the next turn I deploy a fifth speeder to let me battle and win 28-23. Now I DB transit and start to drain at 4 DBs. He spreads out to block my drains and I finish the game battling his lone BHs.<br>
<br>
FW +9<br>
<br>
Game Three: my LS against Andrew Ledwith and his Ral Ops.<br>
<br>
Before this game started, a group of us were talking about how no one seems to use Ounee Ta or No Escape to counter generic sites. I mention that I still pack Ounee Ta in my LS decks and Andrew along with Brian Hollingworth both say that they hope they don&amp;#8217;t have to play against me with their Ral Ops decks. So it was ironic that I am now playing Andrew with a deck made to counter his Ral Ops.<br>
<br>
He opens with Mob Points, IAO, and Resistance and I have my Ounee Ta down. By turn two I have Incom Corp down on the Hoth DB and have Flaps turned on. He deploys Lord Vader at the Spaceport DB on turn three and I come down with Blount, Luke JK, and 4 speeders with flaps on to win 34-8. He loses 26 cards and Vader. Two Turns later he has deployed Janus at the Executor DB ,4 Royal Guards at the Coruscant DB, and Kir Kanos at the Spaceport DB. Next, he DB transits over the guards and Janus to the SP DB to join Kir Kanos for a fighting force. I come down with 5 more speeders to win the battle 48-25. After his forfeits and force loss, he is down to 1 card that he draws up the end the game.<br>
<br>
FW +29<br>
<br>
Props: Ounee Ta, Do Not Leave Home Without It!<br>
<br>
Game Four: my DS against Greg West and his LS Watch Your Step.<br>
<br>
He starts with Staging Areas, Insurrection, and Squadron Assignments. I put down Something Special Waiting for Them to slow down any force retrieval. The first few turns we are deploying DBs for force generation. On turn three I decide to take a chance and deploy 4 ISB agents not inside walkers to get the flip and force drain. I put two down on both the Hoth DB and Y4 DB. I should have known better because he comes down with Mirax, a RFC, and Luke w/ LS to battle me at the Y4 DB. I lose both agents and he loses the RFC. I come back with the Tempest 1 and an ORS pilot. We battle and I draw a DB for destiny! So it is a draw 8-8. Next, he comes down with Chewie w/blaster, Dash, and a RFC to battle my other 2 ISB agents. I lose them both in the battle that he won 15-8. He had also deployed Leia w/blaster at the Y4 DB and then moved out Luke and Mirax to leave her by herself against my Tempest 1 and ORS pilot to block the drain.  (Bells should be ringing, warning, warning, warning!!!!!).  Like an innocent lamb walking into a wolf&amp;#8217;s lair I declare battle against the lonely Leia after adding another pilot to the T1. He reacts with one card to pull Han/w blaster and then plays I Know. He gets 4 destinies and I lose 21-15. I forfeit my two pilots and now I have no ISB agents on the table. So, for the first time in the two years I have played ISB, I am flipped back because I have no agents on the table!!  How will I face ISB Operations after this game? Now the fun was not over just yet. He comes down to battle the lone T1 with Karrde and Wedge.  I lose 12&amp;#8211;9 and lose the force from my hand. He moves the two away. I drop an ORS pilot and Miyoom Onith inside T1 to try to drain and maybe use Miyoom on the next turn to clean out the males from his hand to give me some breathing room.  He comes down with Luke JK and his stick and we battle and his draws a destiny 6. I lose both the ORS and Miyoom. I come down with 5 ISB agents to battle Luke to win 18-12. He forfeits Luke and I lose another 2 ORS.  Now he deploys the Millennium Falcon and Captain Han to Tatooine. I follow him by dropping Zuckuss in his ship and a Dreadnaught to battle him. He loses Han to my destiny draw. Now the game ends as a timed loss with Greg having 23 cards left to my 14 cards.<br>
<br>
TL (-23)<br>
<br>
Props: Greg, he never gave me a chance to think. He was all over me.<br>
<br>
Slops: Timed Games, Greg deserved a full win the way he played his game.<br>
            Myself, for losing all of my ISB agents.<br>
<br>
Game Five: my DS against Andrew Ledwith and his LS There Is Good In Him.<br>
<br>
Andrew commented that at least there is not 1 card that can stop his LS deck. I know that he was frustrated by the speeder beating he took and that his TIGIH deck would be a strong matchup to my deck. <br>
<br>
He starts with all of the usual TIGIH with I Know, Do or Do Not Combo, Insurrection, &amp; Your Insight. After two turns, I drop Tempest 1 with 2 pilots to the Y4 DB. He comes down with Chewie the Protector, Hobbie, and Jek (The Other White Meat) Porkins to battle. I win 12-11 but lose an agent pilot to forfeit. He loses Jek and moves to the Hoth DB.  I pull my Den of Thieves to cancel his Luke JK drains. I deploy another walker with two pilots and 2 other agents to back up my Tempest 1. He deploys some mains to the Y4 DB and we battle. I lose 19-15 and forfeit a pilot and another card to I Know. On my turn I transit everyone back to the Hoth DB.  On his turn , he uses Revolution on Coruscant and he transits all of his groups to Hoth DB.He also transits Jedi Luke to the same DB and because I have two Imperial ISB agents, Luke is captured. Now I am faced with Order to Engage and also losing force to his Objective unless I can deliver Luke to Vader. But, I do not have a Vader in my deck! So I have to battle and forfeit my two Imperials to free Luke. I initiate the battle and lose 28-22. So I lose the two Imperials in forfeit and free Luke and I lose 1 card to I Know. I then transit the heck away from his mains group that now includes Jedi Luke. He follows me the next turn.  I use Abyssin Ornament to retrieve 7 cards with my ORS agents on the table. I deploy a Vic SD with a pilot to  Rendili. He now comes down to Rendili with Home 1 with Blount and Lando in the MF. We battle  and I lose 18-8. I lose the Vic and pilot and another card to I Know. He then moves the Home One and the MF to Coruscant to flip me back.  I try to come back with an attack on one of his mains group with a walker and agents, but I lose 18-15 with an agent forfeited and a card to I Know. Now he just keeps deplying more mains to face up against my divided forces. I lose 3 force to Order to Engage when I run away as well as to his force drains. I try for one last battle at one site and win 16-12. But one turn later, with 1 minute left in time, I lose to his final force drain.<br>
<br>
FL (-21)<br>
<br>
Props: Andrew, for playing a very aggressive game that hurt me in force drain, force loss, and battling loss.<br>
<br>
Slops: Myself, for taking out my Tarkins Order. That would have cancelled OTE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game Six: my LS against Sean Orcutt and his DS Endor Ops<br>
<br>
Sean is a young up and comer, who is a very good player and eager to play. He puts down Mob Points, IAO, and the combo There is no Try along with Endor, the Endor DB, and the Bunker.<br>
<br>
For the first few turns, we draw cards looking for force activation. I get my Hoth DB with Incom Corp and Flaps down and wait for him to deploy. He drops 2 walkers and pilots to the Endor DB. I come down with an ASP droid and an Ewok catapult to the DB and draw up. He drains at the DB and deploys the Chimaera with Thrawn to Endor. I put the catapult on top of my reserve pile and drop 6 speeders for free and draw the 7 for destiny. I win 37-25 and he forfeits all but one Imperial while I forfeit the ASP (stupidly, you will see later). I transit two speeders to another DB. He shuttles the pilot to the Chimaera after he deploys the Flagship Executor and Commander Merrejk  to Rendili and the AO the adds immunity to his Capital ships with pilots.  I drain for two and drop Cracken, Jedi Luke with his stick to the bunker to force drain. He drains at his two systems and drops another system on the table. I lose my other ASP to the drain, drat!! I deploy more speeders at my third DB and the North Ridge. My drains now total 6 per turn to his 4. He comes down with Bossk in the Bus and Zuckuss at his other system and another Capital with pilot at a second system to add to his draining. After another turn I have 5 X-wings that I drop and attack the Executor. But I draw a 1 for destiny. I win 21-16 and he forfeits a pilot and I lose 1 X-Wing. He drains and draws. I FD for 6 and then battled against his Executor. I win 16-12 and he loses the Executor.   I move my x-wings over to block a draining capital, because I have a Houjix in my hand. He drains and battles me. I lose the X-wings and Houjix the balance. I drain for 6 and he has one card left. He drains for 5 and I lose the game.<br>
<br>
FL (-1)<br>
<br>
Props: Sean for hanging on for the win.<br>
<br>
Slops: Losing my ASPs. I could have been returning speeders to my reserve deck each turn to add to my reserve.<br>
<br>
So I end up 3-3 for the day.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
To Charlie for running the show and letting us have our fun.<br>
<br>
To having 20 people show up. I thought the turnout would have been lower with the Jedi Knights demo going on in NYC.<br>
<br>
To Kevin at DJs Comics for renting the hall for us to play in.<br>
<br>
Slops: <br>
Having a plumber using a jack hammer as he was breaking the floor for repairs during our first game.<br>
<br>
Taking almost seven hours to play 6 games. It makes for a long day when you add more than an hour for the commute.<br>
