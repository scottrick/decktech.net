Adam decided to run a tournament at his house to help give him some practice for the worlds (which has now been canceled by Decipher).  There were 8 of us including Hawaiian champion Luca Costanzo, Ronnie &quot;smashed of my face&quot; Wilcox, Giles &quot;Hidden Base&quot; Emery and of course how could we forget Adam &quot;Porn Star&quot; Amy.   We were all pumped up and out came the cigarettes (Giles Smokes? @#$% I am getting old) and some decent music (Including Linkin Park, Blink 182, Vast, Pearl Jam) and we were all set for a good game of wars.  Today I came with my Chasey Lains Box for dark side which was basically a Watto deck with establish control being my key tech and I was playing Stupid Arse Cheese for light side (Dagobah racing beats).<br>
<br>
Game 1 - Chasey Lains Box vs Giles Emerys Showing My Hidden Base is Tech<br>
	Ok, I started by playing We Must Accelerate Our Plans to fetch the bridge and mob points to get the executor.  I then proceeded to flip first turn by deploying Watto from reserve deck to Wattos junkyard and Emperor Palpatine to Mos Espa and cause him 2 force damage (sweeeet!) with Giles losing the outrider and pulsar skate (I think) of the top of his reserve deck (Ha Hs Ha).  Giles then deployed a system and General Lando onboard Gold 1 to Rendezous point, which then moved over to the Endor system.  On my second turned I deployed Mos Espa docking Bay with Establish Control and Vader with lightsaber, setting up a huge drain.  Anyway to keep a long story short, he kept making strikes against my locations, of which I thwarted and kept deploying characters to hold the locations and causing him direct damage.  Poor Giles could not flip his hidden base until very late game when it didn&#146;t matter, but the huge drains and direct damage was just too much in the end.  Full Win by 14.<br>
<br>
Highs:  Giles showing me his Hidden Base before the game started.  What Tech!<br>
Lows:  Giles not flipping his objective until very late game (ouch!)<br>
<br>
2 (+14)<br>
<br>
Game 2 &amp;#8211; Stupid Arse Cheese vs Adam Amys Agents of the Black Sun (non racing)<br>
	This deck had pretty much been Adams little work of art that he had been modeling with for the last 4 months and he plays it extremely well (better than any other player in Australia).  Anyway I draw a Lost in the Wilderness in my opening hand (Wahooh) and made Xizor missing on Adams first turn and since he initiated the drain first I did not have take the direct damage.  Since Dagobah cheese wasn&#146;t my preferred style, I thought I would try something different and deployed guys to Xizors site to try and prevent Adam from finding him.  The podrace wasnt going to plan with Adam drawing a six and a seven and since he didn&#146;t start with a podracer I couldn&#146;t play a step backwards.  Anyway, Adam managed to deploy characters, the audience chamber, scum and villainy and retrieve a bit force and kill of Luke and Obi (bloody P59!).  I cause him a little damage with visored vision since he grabbed and the anger, fear aggression was kicking in a little bit.  I won the podrace and Adam strengthened his forces once I deployed I did it.  I deployed guys to the audience chamber and canceled scum and villainy.  Adam reacted by deploying Dengar with blaster, 4 Lom with Concussion Rifle and some ability 4 scrub to the audience chamber and picked a fight and once the smoke had cleared, Luke and Obi were dead and Dengar was left stranded.  Adam left no force due to I did it and I followed up with a beatdown with Obi (Jedi Resilience rocks) and Dash (WTF?), causing 10 force battle damage.  Unfortunately, by deploying Dash I had run out of characters and hung myself out to dry because Adam had satisfied Battle Plan with Zuckuss at Carida.   Full Loss by 13<br>
<br>
Highs:  I finally pulled off Lost in the Wilderness after a series of rotten luck (don&#146;t ask)<br>
Lows:  My lack of patience and not saving Dash probably cost me the game <br>
<br>
2 (+1) <br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 &amp;#8211; Stupid Arse Cheese vs Leigh Smiths Huntdown Podracing<br>
	Ok, this is one of those most non-interactive games I have ever had.  Leigh opened up with Wattos box and I knew that this was going to be an auto win because of my strong racing package (a step backwards x 3, too close for comfort x 2 and we wish to board at once x 3).  I kept hitting poor Leigh with a combination of AFA (which kept just kept popping up) and visored vision while he managed a few minor drains and visage damage.  There was not one single battle the whole game as Leighs life force was slowly depleted and once I won the race, the game was pretty much over.   Full win by 25<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning the podrace and having AFA popping up quicker than usual.<br>
Lows:  Poor Leigh<br>
<br>
4 (+26)<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 &amp;#8211; Chasey Lains Box vs Lucas EBO Racing<br>
Luca started off by deploy the podrace arena between my two starting locations and therefore ruining much of my pre-planned strategy with establish control (you bastard!).   On my first I flipped my objective and caused early direct damage (yipeee) and by the third turn I had search and destroy running.   While this was happening Luca was busy occupying his EBO sites with his much loved Ishi Tibs and making hit and run attacks against me to disrupt much of my momentum.  Luca, was having incredibly bad luck trying to win podrace to the point where I drew a high destiny on the third round and considered keeping it in order to put me in front (yes, it was that bad).  The Epp hit and run attacks tactics hurt plenty (couldn&#146;t find my barriers and projective telepathys often enough).  Eventually, Luca won the race but couldn&#146;t retrieve force due to secret plans, but made me lose the six force and recycle his race destinies.  Luca then set up a nice drain of 4 at the malastare (sp?) system that started to really hurt as he retrieved back force with Na Shadda (for 2 force as he drew a tracked 1), I did it! And All wings report in.  Luca won it in tight game by 9 force.  Full Loss by 9.<br>
<br>
Highs:  The early direct damage<br>
Lows:  The fact he beat me with out retrieving for the podrace and draining at only one system.  Oh yeah deploying the podrace arena between my two starting locations and ruining my establish control tech.<br>
<br>
4 (+17) <br>
<br>
Game 5 &amp;#8211; Chasey Lains Box vs Leigh Smiths Watch Your Step Racing<br>
	Ok, this game was a complete roll over.  The direct damage of the objective combined with the beatdowns, search and destroy and Establish Control hurt him enormously.  When he used two force to limit the direct damage, I deployed the Executor to the tatooine system with Epp Boba Fett aboard.  In the end the only damage I took was from losing the podrace and a few small drains.  Full Win by 25<br>
<br>
Highs:  Establish Control<br>
Lows:  Poor Leigh<br>
<br>
6 (+42)<br>
<br>
Game 6 -  Stupid Arse Cheese vs Lucas You May Start Your Landing <br>
	Ok, this game was pretty boring.  I kept hitting Luca with visored vision, AFA while podrace was happening and Luca replied with direct damage from YMSYL and few minor drains (stuff I needed to get test one seemed to always be in the force pile, damnit!).  Eventually, I won the podrace, but Luca to my complete surprise deployed come here you big coward to prevent from retrieving (bastard!).  I then deployed I did it, as Luca made one bad error and left Maul by himself at Mauls hut rather than moving him with the dune walker at the podrace arena.  I proceeded to beatdown on Maul with Corran Horn, Epp Obi and Epp Luke at Mauls hut causing him 10 force battle damage (ouchh!). I then set up a drain of three at Kessel and Luca drew the remaining cards.  Full win by 10<br>
<br>
Highs:  The Maul beatdown!<br>
Lows:  Come here you big coward sucks<br>
<br>
8 (+52)<br>
<br>
	Well this put me on fourth position on differential and I won three packs of Coruscant in which I pulled crap and two rares (crap again).  Anyway, the tournament was heaps of fun and at the end of the day we started playing a game where we inserted the word &quot;co&lt;k&quot; into card titles.  Here is a sample of some of the funniest:<br>
<br>
1)	Always thinking with your co&lt;k<br>
2)	Rise my co&lt;k<br>
3)	Awww cannot get your co&lt;k out<br>
4)	I just as soon kiss a co&lt;k<br>
5)	Expand the co&lt;k<br>
<br>
If you can come up with any that are funny, please post them in your reviews.<br>
<br>
Props<br>
- Adam for organizing the tournament<br>
- Steve for organizing the prizes<br>
- Luca for the great games and fondness for Hawaiian shirts<br>
- Ronnie for being smashed of his face<br>
- Giles for being a funny bastard<br>
- Everyone else who turned up<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
- Adam for putting the backdoor boys on and you wonder why the WA boys thought you were gay<br>
- Those Australian bastards who set bogus accounts and keep accusing Adam of being a cheat and calling his girlfriend a dirty pig (how Un-Australian can you get) rather than confronting him face to face.  <br>
- Anyone who couldn&#146;t turn up because the tournament was heaps of fun.<br>
- Anyone who try to play the rules rather than play within the spirit of the game<br>
- Me for making stupid mistakes <br>
