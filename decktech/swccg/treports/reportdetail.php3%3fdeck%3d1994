<br>
At 11:30, my friends and I left for Belle Mead to find the card shop.  After an hour of driving and a few minutes of searching, we found the store and headed inside.  There was a pretty good turnout, 10 people.  This was only my third tourney ever, so I was looking for more experience than wins.  A few practice games and jokes about the Magic players went by, and then we started.<br>
<br>
For DS, I&amp;#8217;m playing MKOS/Scum with Abyssins (not swarms, just 3 or 4) with a Prepared Defenses start to get PotH, First Strike, and Secret Plans.  For LS, I&amp;#8217;m playing a horrid WYS deck (I don&amp;#8217;t have any Palace Raiders or Harvests) with Noble Sacrifices, On The Edges, and Celebration to retrieve.  This deck starts HFTMF to get Menace Fades, Insurrection, and Squad. Assignments.<br>
<br>
Before the tourney I was rated 1470.  <br>
<br>
Game 1 LS vs. Kim Caton, ISB/Scum (1771)<br>
<br>
Now this really sucks.  I&amp;#8217;ve played her twice before at my first and second tourneys, and both games I got massacred.<br>
Nothing big happened this game, just a trading of drains.  Her gigantic space crew chased my Dash and Mara in their ships the whole game, so not much happened there.  I never got any steady retrieval going (come to think of it, I didn&amp;#8217;t retrieve at all that game, except for the occasional First Strike).  This game was really horrible, but I stayed in for as long as I could.<br>
<br>
FL &amp;#8211;21<br>
0(-21)<br>
Highlights: See below the Lowlights.<br>
Lowlights: Losing my first game.<br>
<br>
At this point, I think its gonna be a repeat of my last two tourneys where I go 1-5 or 0-6.  Then, I see hope.  One of my friends, Bill, won a game.  Now to me, this is amazing because if Bill won, then I have a dam good chance of winning!  Then the pairings are called&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2 DS vs. Kim Caton, MWYHL (1771)<br>
<br>
Again?!?!? Awww, crap!!  I&amp;#8217;m thinking that there&amp;#8217;s no chance in heII that I&amp;#8217;ll win, so I&amp;#8217;ll just try to keep my differential as close to zero as possible.  I play as usual, getting the Audience Chamber and Lower Passages out, Boelo, Bib, Ephant, Jabba, Gailid, Mosep, and Scum.  For the first few turns, I get my drain bonuses with Gailid, but then Test 1 stops me dead in my tracks.  When Anger, Fear Aggression made its debut, I just suicided the Stinger to Kessel where she had a few ships and Ghhk&amp;#8217;d, retrieving three force in the process.  She started Battle Plan, which hindered my drains for a while.  When my drains did go through, they where usually stopped by It Could Be Worse.  Eventually, I grabbed ICBW, knowing that Kim played a lot of them.  A few turns later, I drew my It&amp;#8217;s Worse, thinking that this card could save my sorry behind.  Unfortunately, Kim either saw me draw the It&amp;#8217;s Worse or didn&amp;#8217;t want her ICBWs getting grabbed, so she stopped playing them and I never got to play It&amp;#8217;s Worse.<br>
Sometime in this game, I got out Search And Destroy.  This card proved helpful for a while, until she dropped Artoo In Red 5 and played We&amp;#8217;re Doomed.  Then everything started to fall apart.  Finally, We&amp;#8217;re Doomed made its way to the top of her Reserve Deck and Mosep at the AC got that card outta there!  She had to start losing actual force, and I finally had the advantage.  A few turns later, I drained for the win, my first ever win against someone in a tourney that wasn&amp;#8217;t one of my friends.<br>
<br>
FW +7<br>
2(-14)<br>
Highlights: Winning my first game against somebody I don&amp;#8217;t play everyday<br>
Lowlights: Not getting to retrieve much with Scum<br>
<br>
Now winning this game boosted my self-confidence beyond normal (which is quite low).  I had achieved one of my two goals for that day, beating someone over 1700 (In your face, To Do List!!).  Now all I had to do was successfully track for the rest if the tourney and my day would be complete.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 DS vs. Travis Zukowsky, EBOX (1500)<br>
<br>
This was quite possibly on of my best games in the whole tourney.  I had a pretty good hand and had everything set up in 2-3 turns.  Travis, on the other hand, took quite a few turns to get his EBO operational and only had 1 or 2 turns of big drains.  I just drained like crazy and Search And Destroy did its magic to give me the win.<br>
<br>
FW +15<br>
4(+1)<br>
Highlights: Totally destroying an EBOX deck, the deck that I usually have trouble with<br>
Lowlights: This game, like the rest of my games from this point on, were against 1st time tourney players.  Because of this, I didn&amp;#8217;t get much experience and felt a little sorry for the Travis, and the next two people<br>
<br>
Well, at this point I had brought myself in the positives and felt like celebrating (this being my first time ever in a tourney where I was in the positives).  So, I scavenged through the store&amp;#8217;s Reflections 1 box were non-foils were going for 4 for a dollar.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d indulge myself and spent a few dollars, picking up many Fallen Portals, Grabbers, and even some helpful rares for only a couple dollars.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 LS vs. Scott Matthews, Big Blue (1500)<br>
<br>
I had no clue how this game was going to go.  I had never played a TRUE Big Blue deck, without any objective, using my WYS deck.  In my starting, I had Dash, Wedge, and a few other pilots, as well as Tatooine Celebration.  I figured I would hold Tatooine early and fortify it, along with Celebration.  I would spread on the ground and Fallen Portal or Houjix away my troubles at the DBs.<br>
So he started by pulling Executer with Mob Points and getting it t Fondor along with Fel in ship.  My turn, I dropped a few Freighter Capn&amp;#8217;s to my two DBs (Tat:DB94 and a &lt;&gt; DB) with a Fallen Portal and drew.  As planned, I drew one of my matching ships.  His turn, he drops some guys to my Kessel and some more to Fondor.  My turn, I dropped Mirax and Han in their ships and Tat Celebration to Tatooine.  Lando, Wedge and Chewie to the DBs, Luke to the Cantina.<br>
A few turns later, he drops Vader and Tarkin to a DB and battles.  I forget to use the Fallen Portal (I&amp;#8217;m an @ss), but I have enough power and my 2 BDs even things out.  My turn, I deploy Dash to my Coruscant to get some more drainage going and don&amp;#8217;t battle because I couldn&amp;#8217;t have activated enough force AND used a tracked 6 as a BD. So I figured I&amp;#8217;d use the Fallen Portal.<br>
His turn, he deploys some 1/2 scrub and I Noble Sac a RF Cap&amp;#8217;n at an adjacent site for 5 (whoa, never thought I&amp;#8217;d actually use that card).  Anyway, he battles and I forget to use the Fallen Portal AGAIN.  He clears the site minus Chewie, but I rid him of the scrub and Tarkin.<br>
My turn, I drop Melas and battle; I clear the site and lose Chewie in the process.  His turn, he drains his measly drains and knows that my win is inevitable, but he doesn&amp;#8217;t draw up.  My turn, I blindly try to On The Edge Han for a little differential boost, but I draw a 1 L.  I drain him out for the win.<br>
<br>
FW +25<br>
6(+26)<br>
Highlights: Getting mad bonuses from ITTL and draining for like 10 near the end of the game<br>
Lowlights: Forgetting to use Fallen Portal 2 dam times!!<br>
<br>
Well, now I&amp;#8217;m doing pretty well, and there&amp;#8217;s a good chance that I can place at least 4th, as long as I don&amp;#8217;t make any mistakes, which is a habit of mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5 LS vs. Joe Kwiatek, COTVG (1500)<br>
<br>
This game was pretty much in my advantage, as I was playing on Tatooine and didn&amp;#8217;t have to pay for his direct damage from the Objective.  I got Nightfall early and had Boushh in my starting hand, which helped greatly.  She just followed Mara with Saber the whole game.  At one point when he was verifying that I had no DBs, he happened to spot one of my 4 It Could Be Worse and muttered &amp;#8220;Yes, It Could Be Worse!&amp;#8221;  Thank you, now I have four fodder cards, because I will not let you play It&amp;#8217;s Worse (which could ruin any game).<br>
We had quite a few battles on the ground, but he never got out Scum so he didn&amp;#8217;t have any strong retrieval.<br>
Highpoint of battling: Fallen Portal-ing his Bossk which left him with Iggy and Niado Duegad.  I cleared the site with my 2 BDs and he lost some force.<br>
Near the end of the game, I finally got out Tatooine Celebration, but he drew up before I could retrieve much with it.<br>
<br>
FW +23<br>
8(+49)<br>
Highlights: Getting somebody to draw up, and using Noble Sacrifice twice in one game<br>
Lowlights: not getting any retrieval with Celebration<br>
Now at this point, I have a fairly good chance of coming in first, it all depends on the last game.  Bob Caton, who currently held first, just got a timed win so he had 9 win points.  If he lost the last game and I won, I would take first.  It all depended on the match-ups.<br>
Fortunately, the last game was the same for everybody, same match-ups just different sides.  Even better, Bob had to play Kim again, which put the odds somewhat in my favor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6 DS vs. Joe Kwiatek, EBOX (1500)<br>
<br>
This game started out bad for me, I had a horrible hand and he set up WAY too fast for my liking.  It took me quite a few turns to set up, but slowly the game turned in my favor.  When he drained, I cancelled his biggest drains with Control combos.  When I drained, he tried to cancel with Rebel Fleet, but I got out Hutt Influence soon enough and the hurt started raining on him.  Search And Destroy made its return and I was just eating his drains while my retrieval and drains and direct damage slowly whittled him away.  At one point, when I had no drain defense in my hand, he had a full drain of 11 that came in.  This hurt a lot, but I still had the upper hand.  Eventually, he was down to eight life force at the beginning of my turn.  I drained for 7, but that wasn&amp;#8217;t enough.  A quick glance at my hand, and I found the perfect way to end the day.  Fett in ship appeared at Tatooine, I initiated, retrieved 3 with Scum and First Strike, and he lost his last one.<br>
<br>
FW +21<br>
10(+70)<br>
Highlights: Winning in style<br>
Lowlights: Having to pound another new player (newer than me) and feeling a little sorry for him<br>
<br>
Now all that had to happen was that Bob had to lose to Kim.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t watch the game, it was just too nerve wrecking.  After a few minutes of watching Bill&amp;#8217;s EBOX put some beat down on a TIEs deck, I again found myself watching Kim and Bob&amp;#8217;s game.  It took a lot of patience, but I eventually watched Kim win.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe it, I had came in first, and it only took three tourneys to do it!!  I had a choice of $50 store credit or a FOIL, so I took the store credit and got some nice pulls.<br>
The final standings were:<br>
1st &amp;#8211; Greg Shaw (Me)<br>
2nd &amp;#8211; Kim Caton<br>
3rd &amp;#8211; Bob Caton<br>
<br>
I probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t have won this tourney, it should&amp;#8217;ve been Kim or Bob, but I got unbelievably lucky match-ups (aside from the first one).  Oh well, I can&amp;#8217;t really complain.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Nathan Brown for running a nice tourney<br>
Myself for coming in first in only my third tourney<br>
My friend Jon for winning by using Its Worse, his first tourney, and his first win<br>
To myself for having some above average tracking that day<br>
The Only Game In Town for having good service, hot food, cold drinks, and for hosting the tourney, thanks and I&amp;#8217;ll be back!<br>
The mediocre skill level of the players gave me some nice wins and should boost my Decipher rating<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
The mediocre skill level didn&amp;#8217;t give me much game play experience<br>
To myself for having to beat some newbies (well, only returning the favor)<br>
The Only Game In Town for running out of Reflections II<br>
My friend Ryan, for not coming to the tourney (he put school before his hobbies, tschh! what a loser :-P)<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it!<br>
