Tatooine Region (Phoenix)<br>
06.10.00<br>
<br>

<br>
Hello All!!<br>
<br>
   Well, I wasn't planning on doing anything this weekend, but Mike Girard up in Phoenix suggested I head up and play there because they were having 3 tournaments this weekend. I haven't played in a tournament in a couple of months, and this was probably my last chance to prepare for Tatooine's Regional on July 8. So I grabbed a canteen and hopped on my camel to cross the desert towards Phoenix. (God! I love Arizona stereotypes.) Either Tucson and Phoenix have gotten closer or I drive like a maniac, because I made it up there in one CD. (My camel has a good sound system.)<br>
<br>
   I spent Friday night at my ex-girlfriends brother's place. (Because the family still loves me even if she doesn't.) And Saturday morning I head off for the first tournament. One hour should give me plenty of time to get there early and fix my decks a little. Well, after about 10 minute on I-10 I hit a traffic wall. Evidently, it's common practice to just close an entire interstate on a weekend. That's right, not even one lane to use, nothing, zip, zilch! So I'm forced to guide my way through fifth largest city in the US with only a vague compass direction of where I'm going. But I was able to make it with about 15 seconds to spare. So much for fixing my decks before the tournament starts.<br>
<br>
   LS - Playing CC Sabacc for a Profit<br>
   DS - Sienar Fleet Systems*<br>
<br>
* Mental note: Don't email your DS deck to a listserv of AZ players the day before a tournament.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
DS vs. Chris Shaner's Tosche Main's with heavy SAC.<br>
<br>
   Chris is one of the top players in the Phoenix area, and the state. I've played him a few times in the past and I think my best game was a 20 Force loss. Oh well, time to see if any of those fixes I was planning would have helped this deck. He starts Obi-Hut and Tosche Station. I start Imperial Occupation of Wakeelmui/Jungle and Bad Feeling Have I. I probably should have started with Sienar Fleet Systems, but I was hoping BFHI would slow him down enough for me to find one of the 2 in my deck. That didn't work.<br>
<br>
   Well, he was still able to get Obi-Wan Kenobi and his lightsaber to Tosche Station on the first turn, and then he Altered BFHI. I pulled out my sites, but I was never able to get other systems or my ground crew. Slowly Leia w/ Blaster and Twass Khaa invaded Wakeelmui. Eventually, I get Kessel and Kashyyyk set up, but I couldn't do anything against all his early drains. I never did get my SFS. Full loss by 36.  0(-36)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
LS vs. Kurt Winter's Biker Scouts<br>
<br>
   It looked like I avoided the Bye by only 3 Force. I've never played against Kurt so I wasn't sure what to expect. He started the Forest Clearing, and Biker Scout Gear. I started You Can Either Profit By This&amp;#8230; with Jedi Pack Han and Uh Oh!. He didn't deploy any aliens with my objective. I figured that if he stays on Endor than I should have no problem out draining him.<br>
<br>
   I was able to get Tessek to the Audience Chamber and Bo Shuda early. Pretty soon I had 2 Eloms at CC: Casino, and CC: Downtown Plaza and drained for a few turns. Then came the beat down squad. Vader w/ Lightsaber, Mara Jade, Dr. Evazan, and an Elite Squadron Stormtrooper battled. He 'hit' the Elom, but didn't operate, which helped lessen the blow.  I was able to get a few more Cloud City interior sites to hide in, but he was controlling the Casino and Downtown Plaza.  I could never reclaim the Casino because Sergeant Barich was constantly reducing my attrition by 5. I send a couple of Eloms to the Forest Clearing by they too were beat down after a few drains.<br>
<br>
   I was able to inflict a little damage when he initiated a battle without looking at his Reserve Deck. After he activated, I played a hand of Cloud City Sabaac and left him with 1 Force in his Reserve Pile. When he initiated the battle he realized his mistake after playing High-speed Tactics to add a destiny. The tournament director allowed him to take back the interrupt, but he still had to battle. Lando w/ Blaster Rifle added a destiny so I was able to win that battle 28 - 11. Retrieving with Sabaac helped slow down the enviable, but it was still a full lose by 8.   0(-44)<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs. Scot Vale's Echo Base Operations.<br>
<br>
   Scot's a great guy from Phoenix you plays decks you'd never expect. Actually he's taken a lot of flak for the decks that he plays but that doesn't make him any less a nice guy. I only played him in 1 friendly game so I wasn't sure what to expect. He started Hoth: Main Power Generators, Hoth: North Ridge, and Goo Nee Tay. I started with my Objective, but this time I choose Sienar Fleet Systems.<br>
<br>
   I had a good starting hand and Scot had a nervous look on his face. He hoped to survive the early drains and beat me up later on. But when Princess Organa wasn't able to find Reflection I was able to glance though his deck. I noticed lots of X-wings, and droids, but no numbers. I was activating a lot with my sites, the Death Star and Kessel. My ground crew of Djas Puhr, Bane Malar, and Brangus Glee were draining on Wakeelmui while my TIEs were at Kessel. He eventually set up Incom Corporation and Echo Base Operations and also deployed Alderaan and Dantooine. 2 X-wings went to Wakeelmui and Red Leader in Red 1 and another X-wing went to the Death Star.<br>
<br>
   I deployed the Vengeance and 1 TIE Fighter to Wakeelmui and battled. He played Organized Attack, and I played All Power to Weapons. But I also played Tallon Roll and drew a 5 to his 0. After that battle, I played Pride of the Empire and landed the TIE to my docking bay with Djas Puhr. At that point there was nothing he could do. Dreaded Imperial Starfleet was stopping his drains at the Death Star. He was losing 2 Force a turn to Pride of the Empire and Ability, Ability, Ability. I moved my Dreadnaught and TIEs to Dantooine, and was draining him for more. I think Scot will be happy to see the new Third Anthology cards coming out this week. Full win by 21.   2(+23)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
LS vs. Gavin Li's This Deal is Getting Worse All The Time Deck.<br>
<br>
   Gavin started with objective, All Wrapped Up, the East Platform, and Any Means Necessary for the Boba Fett Package. I started my objective and Uh Oh! He started with Ree Yee and Bane Malar to the Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
    First turn he deploys Cloud City, the CC: Security Tower and draws up. I search for Bo Shuda, but can't find it. As I draw up my Force I get the 4 best cards I could hope for. (Bo Shuda, Tessek, Order to Engage, Bargaining Table.) Next turn I'm setup and ready. He deploys a TIE to Cloud City, and 2 lone Imperial Helmsman to the Security Tower and Carbon Chamber. I deploy Bousch to cancel his drains at the East Platform, and Master Luke and an Elom clear out the Carbon Chamber. Next turn he moves Lando over to help fortify the Security Tower. Next turn I deploy Pucumir Thryss to the CC: Downtown Plaza, break Bousch's cover, convert Lando with Lando with Blaster Rifle and deploy 2 Eloms. That gives me the 4 sites to cancel Dark Deal, flipping his objective back and then I battle the last lone Imperial Helmsman. I never even flipped my objective even though I could have the turn after I deployed Order to Engage. Full win by 28.   4(+5)<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs. Andy Marcantel's Ralltiir Operations.<br>
<br>
   He started with Ralltiir and Crossfire. I started with my usual start and he deployed Mara Jade and Boba Fett to the Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
   First turn he deployed a Biker Scout and Speeder Bike to Spaceport Street. I was able to get Tessek and Bo Shuda out quickly. He deployed a Tempest Scout and AT-ST pilot to Jabba's Palace and move Mara Jade and Boba Fett out of the Audience Chamber. 2 Eloms battle the lone Biker Scout, and I start deploying to CC: Casino and CC: Downtown Plaza. I'm able to cancel his drains at Jabba's Palace with Bargaining Table and there's nothing he can do. I flip, and drain at the Casino and Downtown Plaza. Full win by 28.   6(+33)<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
DS vs. Brian Choongphol's Brentson's Beats.<br>
<br>
   Brian started with Mind What You Have Learned and Wise Advise. I started with Imperial Occupation and Sienar Fleet Systems. I get out Kessel and my sites. He gets out Yoda's Hut and Yoda. He's also able to get Obi Wan and Figrin D'an to the JP: Entrance Cavern. I was able to get Secret Plans, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet and Vengeance with 2 TIEs to Wakeelmui. Later a Dreadnaught, a TIE Defender and a Black Squadron TIE start draining at Kessel. They eventually move to Endor to drain for more.<br>
<br>
   Figrin D'an wagers and one of my destinies is a 6, so I start to track it. The Millennium Falcon, Han w/ Heavy Blaster, Wedge, and Red Leader in Red 1 deploy to Kessel. I'm still activating Force trying to get that 6 to the top. (2 Turns.) So now I'm ready, and I deploy a Dreadnaught, 4 TIE Defenders, a Black Squadron TIE, and a TIE Fighter. I battle with First Strike and play All Power To Weapons. 41 - 19, and he forfeits the system. I deploy Pride of the Empire and continue with my drains. Eventually the Redemption and Master Luke with the Bacta Tank come down to fight for control of Kashyyyk, and to destroy my TIE with Pride of the Empire on it. But I'm able to slowly beat that down. He spreads to drain on Tatooine, but it's not enough.  Full win by 18.   8 (+51)<br>
<br>
   Well, all in all it was a good tournament. I was able to pull out 4th place even with that terrible start. I was also able to find things I need to change in both my decks so hopefully I'll be able to do better with them next time. I want to thank Mike Sinclair for running a great tournament, Mike Girard for inviting me down, AZ Gamer for being a great store, all my opponents and everyone else at the tournament for making it a wonderful event.<br>
