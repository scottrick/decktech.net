------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Editorial: If you got a problem with my angst and hate or meaness, or use of edited language, or even my non spell checked reports, Eat it! I got too much to write as a student as is, I&#146;m not gonna make a Tourny Report into a peice of art like the Great @#$%ing Gatsby!  With that in mind please enjoy ;)<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This would be my first tourny after States were I did pretty good, so I figured I&#146;d try to strut my stuff and head out to the burgoning new SW enviroment in Greely, CO.  Now I live in Ft. Collins which is the bomb town, and Greely is to the east of Ft. Collins, about a 45 minute ride, and one needs to know Ft. Collins and Greely just loathe each other as cities go.  Greely has this wretched smell that I can&#146;t stand, so running regulkar tournies in Greely is a love/hate thing for me.  But as they say I get up for the game so I Me and Loveland Crew (Peter Cole and Tom Meade) took the dangerous trek to Greely so I could hopefully whoop up.  <br>
<br>
Now as much @#$% I  give the city I enjoy the company of some of the peeps out there soooo I was hoping it went over well.  I roll in at about 5pm but something was wrong with the post on Decipher so it really didn&#146;t start till 6, bah so I then slew about 45 cash monies and the New Axies and Allies Pacific in my bordem and the tourny got rollin at about 6:30 ish.  We only had 10 people, but Tom Kathman insisted on 6 games :P I htought I&#146;d be unoriginal again and play Crouching Skrillings and Hidden Mains.<br>
<br>
Game 1 Brandon Korgan Hidden Base Space vs. Crouching Skrillings<br>
I know Brandon well from my L5R days, and ever since I guit about a year and a half ago I know that he has become one of the best in L5R.  I always fear players that have aptitude in many different games beacue it takes alot of discipline to play all games well, on the same regard it takes a lot of discipline to play one game.  Either way, it goes doen like this . . . He starts Hidden Base and I ask him &quot;You didn&#146;t start the Camp by any chance did you?&quot; He says &quot;No.&quot; and I say &quot;Oh thats good I&#146;m still in the game, whew&quot;  I set up the Skirlling slop shop as usually by setting up the the Drains and getting some strong ones in b4 he flips.  I am blessed with picking up cards and getting my ships asap so when he does flip I can send out the scouts.  There wasn&#146;t too much to report here since he wasn&#146;t playing The Camp so I was able to abuse his (I think it was) A-Wing Squadron guys and B-Wing Guys with my uber Destiny and Skrillings.  I did have to use a lot of resources to beat him so after all my silly retreival took place I had the Full win by 21.<br>
<br>
2 +21<br>
Highs: Realizing that Tatooine isn&#146;t out so I can still beat up scrub space decks up with Skrillings.<br>
Lows: Only winning by 21, I know there is better potential in this deck.<br>
<br>
Game 2 Mitch Knaub Rendili Star Destoyers vs. Hidden Mains<br>
Mitch is not a good player, I hate to be mean and say this but he&#146;s not.  Now I don&#146;t want to call him a scrub because he has more quality cards than you can shake a stick at, and he won&#146;t trade any of them to me so it gives me more reason to say &quot;he is not a good player&quot;  You can only imagine how this goes down, he starts Rendili with that Jank Effect so not only does he have terrible Force Generation but his Star Destroyers are gonna be weak.  I start Battle Plan because his bad play abilty and Generation will mean no drain against me, am I right about this theory?  Survey says . . . He never drained me once :P  However I did need resources to establishe my weak DB drains and I did decide to be humorous and try to battle him in space with Wedge and I lost a little force here and there to keep him entertained.  I retrieve the force I lose from that, I mistrack an On the Edge for Luke (Like a fool) but I later retreive it back, blah blah blah in the end I win by 28.<br>
<br>
4 +49<br>
<br>
Game 3 Tom Kathman Hidden Base vs. Crouching Skrillings<br>
Tom does not want to play today in General, he is running the tourny after all, and the dynamic duo Pete and Tom keep pestering him about rulings so he was really distracted.  Tom is a cool guy as I have stated before and his rating is moving up since he is the representative good player of Greely.  But I have played him before and I have also seen these decks so I have an idea how to play Tom.  He starts Hidden Base without the Camp, thank god, I still have a chance!  He kinda starts just like Brandon does in game one, and strangely enough I start the same way I do every game.  I beleive I was agian blessed with my space draw so I could deal with him after he flips.  Tom runs B-Wings for Hidden Base so I know I have to pick my fights carefully.  I think I hit him for an early monnok which is no good for him and he flips and I start my quest by coming down hard on his sparsely used B-Wings in space.  I use my guys in space w/ Skrillings to beat him around a bit and I keep  looking for his damn base  but I can&#146;t find it.  He digs and gets his beef out and he drops some mains in space and a destiny adder to make me lose parts of my fleet.  As soon as he fortifies space I then realize his secret base is called Kessel and now I can play my game.  I retreive force to get my lost ships back and I try to reduce his drains to nothing, all the while covering the kessel drain.  Tom keeps it competetive by draining a lot but he can&#146;t keep up with my uber drain denial and gay as hell Scum and Strike retreival.  In the end I win by 12.<br>
  <br>
6 +61<br>
<br>
Game 4 Tom Kathman BHBM Ties no Numbers vs. Hidden Mains<br>
This was an interesting game.  I set up Mains a little bit and I dig for the Falcon, while Tom  digs cards to fortify space, he sets up the throne room with Empy, Ephont, and Empy&#146;s Power and He has some Ties in Space.  So I get the super Falcon and a Bantha Droid to a DB and it is on I come down on a couple Ties only 2 Ability He plays All Power To Weapons then he flips the top Card for Poer to draw a destiny, the top card is Sinear Starfleet Systems, and then the destiny he draw is a 0.  Right after this Tom and Pete both asked him for a rulings questions.  Kathman was to say miffed.  The Game was kinda down hill from here, I was able to retreive, although badly, after losing Luke on an On The Edge against Mitch I wasn&#146;t trusting my Tracking, so I needed to find willing rebels to die for my bad Tracking, and Corran Horn was a willing fool.  Battle Plan was kinda painful for him since he needed to spread out to be effective against my retreival, and I can&#146;t remember nay other big battles other than the Falcon beatdown in the begining.  HE slowed down my retreival with Grabbers so I could not win by too much, but I did win by 18.<br>
<br>
8 +79<br>
<br>
Hey at this momment I was pretty much in the lead and it appears that the big Prize today was a Japanese Foil Vader, which I did not have, this would go well with the Jap Vader that I got in my Prize Support at States, so I was really stoked, untill I had to play some one in Loveland Crew.<br>
<br>
Game 5 Tom Meade Phat Destiny Huntdown vs. Hidden Mains<br>
It appears that I was not the only person tearing it up here, Loveland Crew had been kicking much @#$% so it makes sense that I would have to play Tom Meades DS deck again, I&#146;ve only played it like 6 times in tourny play.  However this game was horrendous for me, I don&#146;t want to go into detail, but it involved such bad luck in my part that I was about to tear apart Tom&#146;s deck.  I have lost to this deck before in Tourny Play, and I play Tom quiote a bit, but this deck cand @#$% ya like a red headed step child if your not careful.  Tom&#146;s deck has 10 6&#146;s 10 5&#146;s and like 5 Visage&#146;s.  And he also has 20 1&#146;s and 2&#146;s.  So the idea as that one could hope before tracking he might draw a bad destiny.  This was not so, in One Battle Tom send against my Ben Kenobi w/ Stick Jedi Luke w/ Stick and JPP Lando a Lord Vader and Mara Jade. This is like the 3rd Turn, Now I had a good idea of what I had in my deck and I had lost some force to a showdown with Corran Horn on the executor.  So Tom battles me and takes lukes stick, he swingd and hits Ben with a 5 and a 4.  I try to Dupe Agent Mara I draw a one, hmmmm.  Mara Slices Lando and he plays I have you know so he has the three spot,  and I actually hit Vader with a 5 and a 5.  This is on CC so I only get one Destiny and tom Draws 3, but he already drew awesome destiny, he can&#146;t already have all of his low destinies in his hands, nah Tom Top Decks two 6&#146; and a 5.  I get pissed and throw up my deck and concede the game I lose by 15.  I hate hate hate playing Tom&#146;s Hunt Down and If I was of clearer mind I would have played more consewrvative.  But my concentration was not here and know where it belongs :P<br>
<br>
8 +64<br>
<br>
OK so that was a drawback but I would get to play Tom Meade Again, and I knew he didn&#146;t have the Camp so I was set.  So All I needed to do was win so I could win a Foil Jap Vader and initiate the back to back jacks.<br>
<br>
Game 6 Tom Meade Hidden Mains vs. Crouching Skrillings<br>
Heh Tom had not played against TJs Skrillings yet, the dumbest deck ever created, I love to play it cause its sooooo creamy cheese and it had give a lot of people a run for their money.  So I think I was gonna make Tom capitulate.  I set up shop faster than you can say &quot;Suck it&quot; and Tom don&#146;t know how to deal with my gay drains, even though he has the Battle Plan goin, once I have the skeleton of the slop shop and some Skrillings Crouching in my hand I can sit back and wait for his play.  He decide to attack and I say No Soup one Year to Ben and that leaves Tom with Lando at Jabba&#146;s Palace where I have the Mercenary on the bus.  He knows he&#146;s dead at that point because he misplyed his peeps so he decides to bend over and let the Skrilling Skull-@#$%ing Proceed.  I do happen to miracle about 6 skrillings to the Bus and I battle him, I retreive 3.  He fails to exclude my Pilot so I get two destinies which are both 4&#146;s and in turn are 6&#146;s, he get a five for destiny, soooooo let how do you say . . . make with the lovin&#146; 6x4=24+9+12=45-(5+4+6)=45-15= You lose You destiny Drawing Hunt Down playing Bastage :P Tom halfassed this game like I did the last game but I havn&#146;t shalacked Tom like this in a while soooooo in the end its all good, Full Win +30<br>
<br>
10+94<br>
<br>
Hey so I&#146;m the only 5-1 in Digital Dungeon in Greely Colorado at the Momment so that makes me the Winner!  I got first, Pete suprisingly took secong, and Tom Meade took 3rd so Team Loveland whooped up in Greely this paticular week.  I got a Foil Jap Vader to add to my collection and 16 dollars in stre credit, which was like 3 crappy packs of Reflections 2.  But I was soooo happy to get a Jap Vader without having to but a case or Ref2.  I cna&#146;t wait till May 4th to go back there and try to win me some more cool foils.<br>
<br>
