<br>
Hey Wuzzup ? Well, that was the first tournemnt I played that was not in Quebec. And there were a lot of good player from the US, so that was like a test for me, to see if I was really good, or if I sucked a$$. <br>
<br>
But first I want to say, I went to my 3rd magic tournement last friday, and I had told my friend Jo that I was gonna win with my Sligh deck ( that's a really gay deck) ( I had 6 sideboard card for some anti-Troll Albinos Tech, lol). He said that If I ever win I was his idol. Well I win (on a last turn topdeck in the final), so now I am his Idol :) Anyways, Magic is a crappy game base 70 % on matchup and luck, but it's just fun to play. <br>
<br>
So now, I'll start talking about the tournement. Well, my head was somewere else those past 2 weeks, so I only played 6 games and a half in those 2 week before the Grand Slam. And 2 of those games were with a  f*cking TIE Scout deck.... Man, that deck was a Pile.... and when I say Pile, It mean Pile... I had 1 TIE Defender and 2 SFS laser , that's just Idiotic ! Anyway I think Yannick Beat me when I was testing that pile by 45 or something (with only 1 starship and no site to drain, hehe....) Then The worst thing happened to me and the Deck... Burntoast beat it by 40.... And Man, It's Impossible I lose to Burntoast, he is a $%#*B ( I censor the word, because that guys will kill me if I ever say he is a scrub).... I can't believe I was going to use that sh*ty deck... Then I play 2 games with  a Trone Room Insert Beatdown deck based on Juz Revenge's deck. And I win both times, so I say: That's my Light Side deck.... I ask some questions of the creator Scott Lingrell, on the deck, he told me to remove the bacta tank and add a 4th Never Tell Me The Odds... But guess what, I don't take his advice and decide to play with only 3 Odds... THAT WAS GAY! For dark I play 2 games with  HDADTJ and The Responsability of Command lockdown. So thats all my playtesting for that tournement. I was supposed to do more, but playing Young Jedi, and drinking beer is funnier. Ok, here Is my decklist: <br>

So friday night I went back home at 3am, I play with myself, and went to bed at 4am. I set my Clock to wake me up at 5:30, because my friend Jo is picking me up at 6:30. Then, I woke up at 6:50.... F*CK!!!!!! I went at my window... there is no car.... SH*T ! I try to find his phone number... I get It, I call, It says it's a bad number... So I remove the regional code and call... I heard the voice of a girl waking up ! D@mn !  I say I have a bad number, but she is pissed, so she start b*tching at my sorry a$$. So, now I can't go to the tournement.... crap.... A girl had invite me to her house that day.... so maybe I would have a good day after all :)  I open the TV... I change the channel... Then I notice its only 6:35 am ! Yeah ! I remember my clock was 20 min in advance :) I went back at my window, and I see my friend is waiting for me. I went outside in underwear,  to tell him I am coming in 2 min. So I grab my stuff and run into his car. I didnt have time to brush my teeth, so I took a bottle of mouthwash. So my friend drive and I am drinking that sh*t... But now I have to spit it... I open the window, I spit, but the crap went everywhere... except outside... There was mouthwash everywere in the car... And the remaining was in my face. Hehehe. I am such a scrub. But still my breath smell a$$, so I drink one more time... I spit It again... And the same thing happen. It goes Everywere in the car. AHHHH my friend is pissed at me, but I am his Idol, so he can't do anything ;P  But he is also my Idol... He was going at 150 Km/h in a small road set for 50 Km/h. It was a 2 way road... and when he was passing car slower that him, he was driving in the wrong way at 170km/h till he was at like 5 meter from another car coming head to head... and went back in the good side of the road... Crazy Driver ! Anyway, all that driving made me sick, and I want to vomit.... <br>
<br>
So we arrive at the Rendez-Vous Point. We are almost the first, unless you count some Ontarian dude and a cute girl. BTW, all my friend tell me I am always talking sex... but I swear, It was Raphael who said first she had nice breasts :) Ok, I admit... I was gonna say It. As a team from quebec, we had a name... We were the Scrub team... Yannick was : Scrub leader. I was : Sex Scrub. Dominic Bouchard was : Scrub B*tch.  And Jo was : Scrub Machine. We all had a badges saying which Scrub we were.... ridiculous... Raphael didnt want to have any, but he is the Excessive Scrub, and Burntoast should be The Scrub Scrub, or the Burn Scrub. Then team Albany arrive, and we saw their professionalism... and our Scrubishness...They were very calm and ready to play... We were all in our binder making our deck like crazy... While some Ontarian scrubs were scouting us.<br>
<br>
Then we went to register... F*CK, its 12 $ for Star Wars, and 12 $ for YJ... We thought it was 12 $ for both... There is no way we play YJ.... I would just feel rape. So we pay 12$ ... And team Albany come to pay... They wanna pay in US money. So, the guy who collects the money ask the Mother Fuc*er that was working at the small crappy shop  what was 12$ Canadian in US ... He calculate with his calculator... It take him 5 min.... His conclusion was that 12$ Canadian was 6$ US $ !!!! F*ck man, is he stupid or what ??? So American paied 6$... I can't believe some people are stupider than me... Then, the owner of Cool Card Heaven/tournement organizer who payed for the room and that have his shop in the place start b*tching at the guy who was collecting the money... What a @#$%... he should have yell at the guy who calculate.<br>
<br>
And then I see a fu*ker with a T-Shirt saying Reel Big Fist Suck. Its one of my favorite bands. Yannick tell me he is Brian Terwillinger. So I went to talk to him saying his shirt was not cool. But he tell me he really like them to, so I think it's cool. Then I see Clint Hays. I went to talk to him to tell him we used to fight on the internet and other thing, and he is cool. ( btw, while I was talking to him, I had a erection. He is the most famous player after all !) HEY !!!!! Did you really think I was serious !!!! Come on guys...<br>
<br>
There were 38 players in The tournement. 10 from Quebec. 8-10 from the USA. And All the others were coming from the Ontario.<br>
	<br>
So the Paring start. I play against Brian Twigg. Hey cool, It couldn't be any better. <br>
<br>
Game 1- My newbie A$$ VS Brian Trone Room Main/Revo deck. (2082 rating)<br>
<br>
While I was starting the game, my friend Jo who was playing Steve Brentson came to see me and told me we had forgotten to put Carefull planing in his Trone Room deck... lol... too much playtesting :) And he won that game :)<br>
<br>
He goes first, and Draw ( he had no 2/0 sites). On My Turn, I deploy a Docking Bay, and Kashyyk ( Our Both hands was real sh*t ). On his next Turn, he Revo my Med Chamber. AHHHHH f*ck, I forgot to pack Revolution Protection. On next turn, I deploy Vader, a Docking Bay and Alter his Revolution. Then On his next Turn, Obi with Stick Smoke Screen Vader. And a Spy and Chewbacca went In My Holotherter I think. On My next Turn, I deploy a The Devastator and Ozzel on Kashyyk. I draw my remaining card (one) and Its Come Here you big Coward :) SOME GOOD ! Then he Deploy a White Border Obi-Wan Kenobie and his Lightsaber to The Carbonite Chamber. He Is Draining Faster than me now...  I deploy Blizard 2 and Evax to The Farm.... man, now that I think about it.... He was playing without Nudj I think... weird. So things stays that way for 1-2 Turn. Then he counter my Blizard with EPP Leia and Harc Self. At The Swamp. Shit... Now He have 2 batle ground, and he just revo back my Meditation Chamber. He plays Free Ride, and Tries to steal my tempest 1... Its a little too big I tell him :) meanwhile, I had drawn Responsability Of Command, Twilek Advisor, and the War Room. So next turn, I twilek for Much Anger In Him... he sense... he got it.... Godamn 0 destiny... That Sux. I draw Mara and Much Anger... Next Turn, He drain me like Mad.... Then, on my folowing Turn, I Deploy The Lock on Obi and Mara Jade In front. He track a Free Ride, and Sorry About The mess her sexy a$$. I did 1 mistake, I let him drain on the Executor, and he was not ocuping 2 battle ground anymore. Then BoShek came to beat  Ozzel At Kashyyk. I draw a Crap destiny.... Now, I dont remeber How I did that, but I track my Second responsability Of Comand for next turn... Boba fett In Slave 1 came to help the devastator and DS-61-3 set the lock on Obi back. I Attack... hope he dosen't have Punch IT ! I kill the Mini Falcon. Then.... The game was close, Orimarko and Luke kick The Tempest 1 out of Yavin 4. There was A Little Fight Between Vader and Twash Khas on Endor..... Twash Won..... :( lol. Anyways, really close game. <br>
FW +6 (2 +6)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Winning against a Top US player. I love close games. Talking to Brian, he is a great guys, and a Tracking Machine.<br>
<br>
Downfalls: Well, In my 3rd turn, I activate 2 less that I could... I forgot a Location I think, and Brian let me activate my 2 in my deploy phase, he is cool.... but It mean I already made 2 mistake... And I never make any mistakes.<br>
<br>
Game 2- My Smart a$$ VS Alex Klamroth ( hope I got your name right this time :) (1881 rating)<br>
<br>
This won't be a game description.... IT'S THE EVER SH*TTIEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAY IN ALL MY GODD*M LIFE !!!!!!!!! ! I PLAY LIKE A F*CKING NEWBIE !!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Mistake # 1-3 : He have Vader a the Trone Room with a empty Devastator on Endor. I deploy Frozen Asset on his only force. I put the Falcon (empty) in front of the devastator. Then he tries to alter frozen aset to do Imperial Barrier on my pilot. I said... wait, I can't put a empty ship I must deploy also a pilot in the same time, so you will have to wait before you alter the asset. he said your right :) So right now, I think its cool, He wont barier my pilot.  I deploy LUKE ! draw their fire . I say Beatdown, and I attack.... He felt bad for the scrub I was, and he told me I can't attack because HDADTJ is on the 7 side...... So he destroy my ship the folowing turn and retrieve with my draw their fire.... I loose 3 more.... I am lucky he lost his lateral Damage to a visage... It would have been game.<br>
<br>
Mistake # 4 : I mistrack a On The Edge destiny of 5... It was a 3.... I cant believe I miss a destiny tracking.<br>
<br>
Mistake #5 : So I give Up on Talking Space. Bad Feeling was Choking my A$$. Vader is still at the trone room. So, Ben went to the farm to flip back the objective. He has 1 force left. I put Luke in front of Vader, he Barrier, I Skywalker, he Sense, he miss. He have 0 force left. I attack, I retrieve 1 with draw their fire, he lost 1. I slash him. I play The Force Is Strong With This One, He play I Have You Now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I drew a 5,5,3. he drew 2,4,5.   He lost 1 force.... he should have lost 10 because he could not play I Have you now !!!!!!! Its really my worst game ever.<br>
FL -14  ( 2 -8)<br>
<br>
Highlights : he was the only player of quebec that had a winning record against me ( 2-0 ) ( one of those is because Yannick did not know his rulings ;p . Actualy, he beat me twice at my second tournement) So, I was loking forward to play ( beat :) him. Before that tournement, I didnt really like him, but now, I can say we are friend.<br>
<br>
Downfall : Guess What ! And Yeah... My starting was all red with ALL my destiny adder. He and only 1 Visage, And I did not draw any Transmision Terminated :(<br>
<br>
So we ask to have some time to go eat. But the f*cking owner say stupid @#$% like, each minutes I say in this room, I pay $.. so you have 10 min to go eat till next round... well F*ck you B*tch. So, we went outside to go eat.... Then my friend made me notice, that some girls were exercising... so I walk backward to see them.... But why do you think they were exercicing ??? BECAUSE THEY HAD FAT A$$ ! Oh yeah, It was funny as hell when Raphael spit his Hamburger because it was Cow Sh*t or something.<br>
<br>
Game 3 My HDADTJ VS Some Local Scrub Operative deck on Alderand. (900 rating)<br>
<br>
At first I was not sure if he was a Scrub or a good player. Untill he start bargaining table:) I decide I don't need IAO and go for Battle Plan. His Farm was a good site for Vader. He actualy never flip. Because of HDADTJ, leia was consider to be at Non Battle Ground Site to flip the Objective. Luke had Some Responsability Of Command... another Non batle Ground. Zuckus In Mist Hunter Was Draining all game somewere. And a Presence Of The Force on Alderand and Boba Fett Finish Him Off...<br>
<br>
FW +28 (4 +20)<br>
<br>
Highlights : Winning.... I was desperate.<br>
Downfalls: Playing a f*cking Scrub.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My beatdown deck VS The Bitch :) no, actually Clint Hays is very cool. He start Death Star. With IAO<br>
<br>
On my first turn, I traumatize him... It's because I had a Sylvester the Cat Sticker on my Nudj, and a Pig on my other. On the few First Turn, I draw, Insert, put only 5D8. While he deploy the Choruscant, the Executor, And the Yavin 4 Docking bay. The Insert Reach, and he lost 5. I get a look at his deck and he has only 2 torture. He deploy Kiffex, Ozzel, another Pilot, with a Dreadnot and Vader's Shutte I think. I don't do a Shit. Except deploying a Odds and Artoo, and I  draw like Raphael... errr I mean like Crazy :) that guys just draw too much. At least Raph, I am Playing Yoda Stew :) Then he deploy a Combo of 2 pilot in the Tempest Scout 1. He attack the lone Obi I had There.... I draw a 0.... I was pissed about that 0... It made me forgot he was Imune To Atrition &lt;4 (Mistake #1). On My next Turn, I deploy Luke To Kill a Pilot. I draw a 3, He said I am Imune To Atrition... @#$%. In fact, I never read witch pilot was in that Walker , so he could have mess with me... thats my first mistake of this game. The Insert Pop, He torture, I Grab. At that point I realise he was playing with 3 torture, because last turn, 2 was in his reserve deck, and he did not draw any card. So he had It when the first Odds reach the top. And Clint, when you told me you were fuc*ing with me and the 2 torture stuff, well yes, but at this point I knew you had 3. Then He Deploy Kashyyk or Endor.... The Mist Hunter and a Pilot there. A couple turn Later, I lay the beatdown on His Chicken Walker..... I Put Draw Their Fire, Frozen Asset, and my 4 EPP. I attack, Play 3 Destiny Adder ( I had 4 in hand, but I was short in force) so I drew my remaining destiny, 9. Thats soooooooo gay !!!! he only lost 15 force..... ridiculous... He drew a destiny of 5... Lucky. Then, He was draining for 4 in space, and paying for Battle Plan. I was draining for 2 on Yavin and also Paying.At one point, I start thinking again like a scrub. He had 8 force. He pays 3 to drain, I play ITCBW. He pay 3 to Grab. He don't drain at the other site.... It would have probably won if I had Play It on the 2nd Drain. Them. ANOTHER MEGA MISTAKE ! I want to hang out in space a couple of turn to drain for free. I have a on the edge, the tantive, Han, leia, Tunnel Vision in hand... but Han and Leia are already on table. So I waste 1 turn and deploy Order To Engage... ridiculous. At the end Of His next turn, I suicide han. with a On the edge that I needed to draw a 6. next turn, I want to deploy han In the tantive against Zuckus in mist hunter.... I was Calculation this way, 2+3 abilyty =7 .... errrr its so gayyyyy. Why didn't I had track a destiny and Retrieve..... so we drain till the end... I am trying to find a Odds or a ITCBW, but I had forgotten I was only playing with 3 Odds, and my ITCBW was Grapled... So, I can say, I made like 3-4 Big Mistake... <br>
FL -4  (4 +16)<br>
<br>
Highlights: It was fun playing Clint, thats all. Even If we didnt talk much.<br>
<br>
Dowfalls: PLAYING LIKE A MOTHER F*CKING SCRUB AGAIN ! OH yeah, at mid game, I really wanted to take a dump...<br>
<br>
Meanwhile: Matt Sokol was playing Yannick next to me. Man, Matt Is so funny. Yannick was beating him very badly. And At each good move by Yannick, Matt was like:' Soooo good man. You own me, I am your Bitch.' lol !<br>
<br>
Game 5 :  The Sold Dom VS Dominic Bouchard HDADTJ / Duel Deck (1813 rating)<br>
<br>
I don't want to deploy anything, so all game I lose to visage and Vader's drain, while he torture my 2 Odds, even If I had grapled the 1st one. I drain for 2 at the holoteter all game. I base all that game On a Lost Grimtaash.... It took me 4 turn to have it... Its because 1 turn, he draw all his force pile, and he let me look at his deck while searching for something he did not had. I notice he had no Vader's Obsession. So 4 Turn Later, I Grimtash him lost. He had only 1.... sooooo gay. Anyways, I did not do anything good. soooo.... <br>
FL -48 (4 -32) <br>
<br>
Wait.... How can that be possible... he had 8 card in his starting hand, and 6 on table... he could have only win by 46.... hmmmm weird.<br>
<br>
Higlights: Well, I hope that huge lost will put me very low, and I will do a 3-3, because I dont wanna play against a good player, and loose and do a 2-4.<br>
<br>
Downfalls: Guess who's next ?<br>
<br>
Game 6 : The Scrub VS Steve Brentson Opperative deck on Botawi. (2023 rating)<br>
<br>
He start with the Jungle. I start battle Plan. My deck Is made to beat a deck with main, not a Speeder deck. So that's gay !!!!!!First Turn, I Alter Yarna. So, I hope he wont Draw too much.... but no, he drew a lot all game, that's bad, I don't play Monock.  His Turn, he cancel my Visage with a bothan spy and a Ithorian. SOME BAD ! I have no character to go beat him. But...I got a lucky anti Ops Start. I have 2 drain of 2 planet, and a Presence Of The Force with 3 Ship. So I Split My ship with a barrier in hand. I also put U3P0 Undercover on the executor.He Flip his objective with 3 Speeder. I alter his bargaining table... he grab alter, and put a table back the turn after. Luke and The tantive got barrier on Kashyyk. I don't have the lock combo, or a pilot, so Bossk from Botawi come to help him. On his next turn, he drain me for free everywere, I lose like  10 force. But... Luke was in the Tantive, so its not a Battle Ground... My first mistake of this game. Next Turn, I put the lockdown on Luke. He put Gold Leader and Shuttle Luke on ground... I am dying.... I Lateral Damage The Tantive, Put Zuckus In Mist Hunter. So I Clear Space. Now, I am like... F*CK! I forgot to put a character in front of Luke. So I drop ZIMH in front of Luke. Well, At this point he had not enough force to drain everywere. The Much Anger Combo and my drain of now 5 force each turn was hurting him alot. In late Game, he try to retrieve 3 with Nar Shada... but I had track his destiny ( I wanted to attack with Mara when he had a low destiny on top), and I knew he would have miss. Close game. <br>
FW +2  (6 -30)<br>
<br>
Highlights: It was cool playing another top US player, even tho he was almost never talking. He is a very calm guy.<br>
<br>
Downfall: One more mistake.... I cant belive that. <br>
<br>
Its my Worst ever F*cking tournament, It's getting worst and worst. Man, I really need a way to concentrate. At least, If I would have been stressed a little, I am sure It would have help. But I was playing like I was playing a game for fun to a local scrub. I need to take a fu*king break from that game. And I really feel like I play for nothing... man It has been 9 month since I play In tournement, and I am still a Scrub... 3-3 - 30   lol :(<br>
<br>
The Final was between Yannick Lapointe VS Alex Klamroth. You are correct, 2 Quebecer ;) Alex won. Congratulation to both Yannick and Alex.<br>
<br>
Now With The Bullsh*t. The God*m Mother Fuc*er that organized that tournement was Gay. Brian Twigg was talking his price, and he refuse to take a poster the Fuc*king B*tch was giving. Then the f*ck start Yelling at Brian, then Brian Apologize, but that B*tch keep yelling like a a$$. Then Burntoast came in the action and Start B*tching at the Fuc*er. The Old bastard said something about Montrealers and that we sux. Then Raphael start B*tching at the F*ck. MAN !!! It was so funny watching Raph, he was so frustrated, he told the guy something like: Lister here you silly B*tch, Go Fu*ck yourself you goda*n fuc*ing a$$hole, then suck your father d*ck you fu*cking co*k sucker.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, that b*tch also start the YJ tournement between the middle of the SWCCG tournement because he did not want to pay extra hours... Hey B*tch, your just a mother f*cker.<br>
<br>
So, The American left the building. We left 5 min later. Outside, we see the truck of that old fuc*er. So someone say, get your keys out, we are gonna scratch that b*tch truck. Then, when we get close, we notice someone had already f*cked the truck :) lol . I am sure it was Brian :) good job.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is The Result.<br>
<br>
1-Alex Klamroth 5-1 Montreal, Quebec <br>
2-The Crusher 5-1 Laval, Quebec <br>
3-Jonathan Chu 5-1 Nashville TN, I think<br>
4-Travis Something 5-1 Somewhere in the US<br>
5-Raphael Asselin 5-1 Lachenaie, Quebec <br>
6-Eric Paquin 4-2 Montreal, Quebec <br>
7-Someone... 4-2 <br>
8-Burntoast 4-2  Laval, Quebec<br>
<br>
And there was only 10 Guys from Quebec... And just a constatation.... There is nobody from Ontario in the top 8... and why is all regional and big tournement never in Quebec but always in Ontario ? Everytime there is a Ontario and Quebec tournement Quebec ALWAYS win.... thats just gay. I mean, I have nothing against people from ontario, but at least half of the big tournement should be held in Quebec.<br>
<br>
