a 30 player tournament where, of all people, my *brother*<br>
took 2nd. My brother&#146;s always been a mediocre-to-good<br>
player, but not one who&#146;s tuned his decks for the tournament<br>
scene. His background in Star Wars has been casual games<br>
with me, our cousin and his roommate, playing the sort of<br>
decks that commit 20 cards to building the Death Star or<br>
setting up 5 card combos. But, apparently, that was a much<br>
better way to play Saturday than playing Jedi Training and<br>
Hunt Down (especially when you forget Jedi Test 2 for two<br>
straight games). At any rate, I was officially &quot;sick of<br>
losing.&quot; At least sick of losing multiple games in a single<br>
tournament. I had also managed to buy some Reflections II<br>
on Saturday and traded my junk for mains. Go figure. The<br>
coolest card was, of course, Popsicle Han, and I proceeded<br>
to see if I could combine &quot;fun&quot; (always a slight concern)<br>
with &quot;effectivenes&quot; in a new CCT deck. It almost worked, but<br>
not quite to my satisfaction in a Monday playtesting with<br>
Justin &quot;Moffwicket&quot; Alfs. Meanwhile, I decided uber-high<br>
destiny were good, but waiting 7 turns to complete test 5 <br>
and get them was bad. So I slapped together a Turn Vader<br>
deck (TIGIH), sort of like the one on DeckTech, but with<br>
enough significant changes to think of it as my own. For DS,<br>
then, I had a last-minute glimpse of insight and decided<br>
to resurrect RalOps in what I&#146;m beginning to think is<br>
becoming my signature style (pulling a good archetype from <br>
the past that everyone thinks is dead and playing it).<br>
<br>
Game 1: My AT-ST RalOps vs Moffwicket&#146;s Profit<br>
Right away, I ask Justin if he&#146;s playing Ounee Ta, figuring<br>
he must since it&#146;s a profit deck in a heavy, heavy scum<br>
environment. He shows it to me, but starts the card that<br>
searches for Lando, R2 and slave Leia. Fine by me. My first<br>
turn, I get somebody out to the DSII docking bay with<br>
Carida and the Raltir DB. Meanwhile, the Emperor and Lord<br>
Vader managed to find their way into my opening hand.<br>
Sweetness beyond all sweetness. Justin&#146;s first turn, he<br>
deploys Ben Kenobi and frees Han to flip and retrieve a<br>
huge 1 force. I flip on my 2nd turn with the Emperor and<br>
Janus coming to the ground and my scrub DB transitting.<br>
Justin starts counting his force and asks me, &quot;So all my<br>
rebels are deploy +2?&quot; I nod. He saves for a couple of<br>
turns while plinking at my life force for drain of 1, 1<br>
profit damage (Ben found his saber). Meanwhile, I set up<br>
Overseeing it Personally and Vader gets his saber and finds<br>
his buddy Tarkin. Mara, also, comes to the desert to play.<br>
Oh, and I nearly forgot, with the Emperor&#146;s drain on the<br>
3rd turn while he was all alone, Justin played Lost in the<br>
Wilderness only to draw a 1 and find that Dark Jedi are not<br>
so easily confused. Again, the Dark Jedi display their<br>
uncanny direction finding abilities when Justin again plays<br>
Lost in the Wilderness against Vader&#146;s 3 character drain<br>
and draws... yup... a 3. Ha ha. That was funny. Anyway,<br>
after I&#146;m done teasing Justin with my drains, he finally<br>
saves up enough force to launch an assault at Mara,<br>
deploying Masta Luke, R2 and 3PO and Chewie w/Blaster and<br>
battles. I react with Tempest Scout 6, holding a Trample in<br>
my hand and expecting Artoo&#146;s Bad Feeling. However, Justin<br>
plays that first to cancel my battle destiny, so I try to<br>
trample Chewie and draw the 1 that would have trampled the<br>
droids, but no one else. He shoots at Mara with Chewie and<br>
misses. I slash Chewie. He tries to choke Mara and misses.<br>
He plays Rug Hug. Hmm... No one in their right mind plays<br>
Rug Hug, but Justin plays it. And this could be very bad.<br>
But, true to form, Justin continues to draw weak destiny so<br>
that Mara and Tempest Scout 6 cover the damage with a little<br>
overflow, while Justin loses Chewie. On my turn I drain for<br>
a bunch and return the beat-down with another AT-ST. And<br>
then it&#146;s a drain race until IG-88 finds out that all the<br>
destiny in my reserve are 3 or higher, so he goes against<br>
Han and Ben and kills Ben, only to die in the process,<br>
leaving Han all alone. Without a drain, Justin backs up Han<br>
and deploys Lando. Ozzel comes down in an AT-ST and Tramples<br>
Lando. Garrett, who&#146;s now watching the game, assists me by<br>
making, &quot;Squish, squish, squish&quot; sound effects. I win by 8.<br>
<br>
Mike Ravelling, meanwhile, has won by the highest<br>
differential. Garrett plays Mike, and I play Graham Neal.<br>
<br>
Game 2: TIGIH w/uber-destiny vs. Scummy Graham (MKOS)<br>
As long as I don&#146;t stupidly invade the audience chamber<br>
while my opponent has enough force left with which to beat<br>
me down, my deck tears through Scum. Never Thinking with<br>
his Stomach Luke allows me to put my only Jedi Luke in the<br>
deck as a destiny 6 back up and drain and activate like a<br>
mofo. There were too many battles in this game to recall<br>
them all. It was battling back and forth all game, really<br>
a good game. Graham set up his main force at Jabba&#146;s Palace<br>
sites, not drawing Gailid in the first few turns, thus<br>
allowing me to set up my DB activation with Luke and Crix<br>
and scouts until I revealed my secret anti-Scum tech: a <br>
generic DB placed in-between the Desert Heart and Jabba&#146;s<br>
Palace. Aha! My scouts were now ready to invade. There was<br>
one good battle at the &lt;&gt; DB when Graham had his Sail Barge<br>
and a ton of aliens against my scouts. As soon as Boelo<br>
was deployed, Chewie Protector blanked his text. An average<br>
Fallen Portal took out both the Merc Pilot and Dengar w/<br>
Blaster. I cancelled his destiny with General Solo and <br>
drew a 6 for my own. He lost some characters, and on my <br>
control phase, I blew up the Sail Barge with a tracked 6<br>
for Under Attack. In the end, I was able to retrieve a bunch<br>
with On the Edge while Graham was unable to find a grabber,<br>
and Luke and my scouts took over Jabba&#146;s Palace, forcing<br>
Jabba to run out of the Audience Chamber so I could <br>
cancel Scum. Full win by 17.<br>
<br>
Mike Ravelling won by more than anybody else for the<br>
second straight round, effectively annihilating Garrett<br>
Larson in one battle at the Cantina.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My DS vs Garrett&#146;s TIGIH<br>
I leave Luke alone until I get Vader into my hand. But the<br>
deciding event of the game... I draw Overseeing it <br>
Personally into my opening hand. Garrett has started Battle<br>
Plan, Wise Advice and Squadron Assignments, so I&#146;m a bit<br>
confused, but Garrett&#146;s always doing things a bit off-kilter<br>
so it&#146;s no great shakes. I get another quick flip, using<br>
Imperial Command to fetch Ozzel into my hand for big<br>
activation on my 3rd turn with lots of DB&#146;s controlled.<br>
And, combining the deciding event with the deciding moment,<br>
Garrett searches for Wedge by revealing Red Squad 1 on his<br>
2nd or 3rd turn and fails to find him, thus allowing me to<br>
verify his masses of Eloms and inserts. Ah... one of *those*<br>
decks. And suddenly all the guilt about playing RalOps has<br>
completely dissipated and vanished. And the Overseeing it<br>
Personally in my hand is a godsend, and the You Cannot Hide<br>
that I started with is going to stay there ALL GAME.<br>
Garrett is unable to do much to me while I flip, but he<br>
moves Wedge over to Raltir when Mirax can join him in her<br>
ship. I have Bossk in Bus, Fel, a Laser Cannon and Lateral<br>
Damage in my hand. Naturally, I use 2 to search for Saber 1<br>
and beat the tar out of a 0-power lone Wedge in ship, by<br>
30-something. Wedge forfeits for 6, and then it&#146;s a mass of<br>
Eloms and inserts hitting the lost pile while Fel dominates<br>
Raltir. A few quick drains, a barrier and trample on an<br>
Elom brigade, and the game is mine. FW by 20-something.<br>
<br>
Mike Ravelling might not have won by as much as me that<br>
round, but he still 30+ differential ahead of me. We just<br>
played the same sides, so I hope someone good gets paired<br>
against him. Graham Neal gets paired to play his dark<br>
against Mike&#146;s light. I think there is hope.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My TIGIH vs Travis Bean&#146;s Bring Him Before Me<br>
I take out Staging Areas in favor of Wise Advice, and this<br>
proves to be a very, very good move when I verify Travis&#146;s<br>
deck a few turns in and see the heavy SAC I feared. As it<br>
turns out, a turn or two after I give up Luke to Vader and<br>
force Vader back to the Throne Room, I draw Insight and<br>
scrap it for Staging Areas, so everything works out. Except<br>
that Travis is activating a bunch, too, and has managed to<br>
get down a large force at Endor, including Veers in a walker<br>
and IG-88 with gun. That does not bode well for me. So, I<br>
save my force (since we&#146;re both losing one a turn, me to his<br>
drain, and him to his objective) and deploy en masse to the<br>
Tatooine DB he gave me. Travis tried one early duel, drawing<br>
a 5 and a 4 (I think) only to stack a card, so he&#146;s pretty<br>
much given up on dueling at this point. He chases me around<br>
for a bit, until I lash back with Obi w/Saber and Nien Numb<br>
and Lando vs Mara 4-Lom and some others. I lose the battle,<br>
but my attrition clears his site. However, I have to stack<br>
one, and we&#146;re even on the stacking. I draw the back door<br>
and have this brilliant idea to play a couple of characters<br>
there and split forces to try to get in a drain. That allows<br>
Travis to battle me there with IG-88 and Fett, miss the<br>
capture (and prevent me from On the Edging Crix out of the<br>
battle), draw his destiny and stack another card while Crix<br>
and Blount cover my damage. I get Wedge up in space with<br>
a Laser on R2 in R5, and he gets in some drains, evening<br>
things out a bit. Travis then starts draining at the Back<br>
Door, so I move over to block the drain at the Back Door<br>
with Han, Cracken, Leia w/Blaster and landing Wedge. He<br>
doesn&#146;t initiate the battle due to Fallen Portal but<br>
reinforces his troops, sending IG-88 over. I initiate a<br>
battle and use my first action to play I Know. He captures<br>
Han. I shoot somebody. I play the card to reduce his<br>
destiny by 3. Attrition clears the site on both sides, but<br>
he stacks another one, giving him three. I battle with Obi<br>
w/Saber against the lone Ephont Mon he moved to my Hoth DB,<br>
and I stack my 2nd. On his turn he duels me, but he wins,<br>
so I just lose 3. My turn, I don&#146;t do much, drain for 1.<br>
On his turn again, he duels and loses. I stack one. I say,<br>
&quot;If you draw a 6, you win. If you don&#146;t I win.&quot; I have<br>
tracked 6&#146;s all through my deck. He draws a 6. He wins by 5<br>
while I have about 20 life force left. Good game.<br>
<br>
Mike Ravelling beats Graham&#146;s scum deck like a stubborn<br>
mule. Graham&#146;s scum suddenly looks vulnerable. Mike<br>
suddenly looks invincible again.<br>
<br>
The final results then, go:<br>
Mike Ravelling 8 (big differential)<br>
Josh Grace (me) 6 (40-something)<br>
Travis Bean 6 (less than 40-something)<br>
Other people<br>
<br>
This just in! Mike Ravelling is Prince Xixor. Ability of 6<br>
needed just to draw a destiny against him, and he&#146;s <br>
immune to attrition less than 5 while Jim Li is not at the<br>
same tournament.<br>
<br>
Cheers:<br>
Justin for playing Profit and getting beaten.<br>
Graham for playing Scum and getting beaten.<br>
Prince Xixor for winning the tournament with a cool LS deck.<br>
Travis for turning my Luke. &quot;1 out of 2 Lukes agree...&quot;<br>
Myself for avoiding pairing with Herb.<br>
The Hansicle for looking cool.<br>
Mirax for being hotter than any of the other SW:CCG females,<br>
not much for personal interest other than debate value.<br>
<br>
Jeers:<br>
Garrett for playing Eloms &amp; Inserts. Boo! Hiss!<br>
Justin&#146;s Hansicle deck. (You know what I mean.)<br>
Shannon Baksa for still looking like a junky even if she is<br>
wearing a sheer top in the new photo.<br>
Herb. In general; I&#146;ve tried to avoid saying this, but each<br>
Tuesday, this statement has just become all the more<br>
inevitable.<br>
All those people who buy 3 or 4 boxes of an expansion and<br>
then try to &quot;trade&quot; with you, laughing at your cards and<br>
kicking sand in your face while taking off with your gal.<br>
Graham&#146;s sex jokes. They&#146;re as stale as his old...<br>
That Josh Grace guy for putting Traffic Control and Reactor<br>
Terminal in his Top 10 cards. What a dweeb!<br>
<br>
Ciao!<br>
<br>
Josh &quot;I&#146;m only partially a scrub&quot; Grace<br>
