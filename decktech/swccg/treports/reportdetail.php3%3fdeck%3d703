<br>
 There is alot of prelude and things I did after the game because I am trying to describe it with all the detail I can<br>
<br>
<br>
It was now May 6 2000 (the date I have been waiting for 'Ramapo Con ll') I woke up at 7:30 A.M. (Oh Yeah my friend slept over because I was giving him a ride), and then I woke up my friend so we can fine tune the decks we were bringing. Well after about an hour of working on our decks I go and get ready because I want to leave about 9:00 A.M. So it is now 9:00 and my mom is also ready so we leave for Ramapo College( I live on Long island, New York so it is gonna take about an hour and a half). Well we are heading for Ramapo College (we are almost there). Our first stop was at a Mcdonalds because we had to go to the bathroom and eat something so we werent gonna be hungry for a while. We arrive at Ramapo College at about 10:30 (when I arrive I start looking for a friend that was gonna meet us there) and I pay my 10.00 to get in. I fill out my command card and I start to talk to some of the people I know. Well the tournament is about to start(11:30 A.M.).  Also I am trying to feel confident not to the extent of @#$%iness I am just trying to think I am gonna win.   The decks I decided to play was a Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi (Scott Lingrell Style) and a Y4 numbers deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1 Round 1    My Ds vs Alexander Mesegeur(1575) Profit<br>
<br>
Well I went into this game with an excellent opening hand. He started the Jedi Pack Han for his objective and I did not start any aliens. Plus he did not have a starting effect for some reason ( It made me think he was kind of a beginner). I started A twilek Advisor and a Imperial Arrest Order. Well I go first and I use the Imperial Arrest Order to get out the executor: Dockingbay. I dont know why I did not deploy Vader.I saved all my Force. Then it is now his turn and he activates his force and thought it was great that I did not start any aliens so all he did was draw 2 cards and saved the rest. ON my Turn I pull out the Death Star Dockingbay and still didnt deploy Vader because I knew he was gonna deploy some characters next turn. So all I did was Twilek advisor for a Crush the Rebellion and I played it. ON his turn he activates and deploys Ben Kenobi and his lightsaber to Tatooine Jabbas palace and deployed a Master Luke to the audience chamber and freed han. He then took a boshuda out of his deck and put it at the chamber and then he left Han by himself and moved Master Luke over with Ben. Now I am happy so on his turn I look for an I have you now. On my Turn I activate 1 force and Look for another I have you now( just incase he senses one) and then I continue my activation. I go down to Tatooine Jabbas Palace with a Darth Vader with Light Saber, and a Mara Jade with A lightsaber. I You are beaten Ben kenobi and initiate the battle. I hit luke succesfully, but luke missed Mara Jade. I then play I have you now. He draws a 2 so Mara is immune but Vader is not. I draw 2 6s and a 5. I have power 21 to his 7. He had to lose luke and 14 cards. I lost Mara So ididnt have to lose Vader. The game was coming to an end since we have been losing some force to visage and then 14 force loss he just had. After the battle I use 4 force during my move phase to pick vader back into my hand so i can prevent some beat down or just me losing Vader. I then draw a couple of cards. He goes and Drains me for 2. He did not have any characters so he drew up. I go and activate my force and Deploy a Darth Vader Dark lord of the sith with his lightsaber and a Grand Moff Tarkin. I iniate the battle and hit Ben with Vader. Ben tries to hit vader over tarkin for some reason but he misses vader so i dont have to use my ability to cancel a destiny. I play I have you now and draw 2 6s ( they were both tortures after all I was playing 5 since my hunt down deck is really weak verse numbers). He draws a 5 butg i cancel it. He has a power of 5 to my power of 22 so he has to lose 17 cards and it was now game over and i win by 26<br>

Game 2 Round 1   My ls vs. Steven Gillipsie's Ominous Rumors<br>
                              (1886)is his rating<br>
This game I knew was gonna be tough. The reason why i knew i was gonna have a hard time was because I only had 4 ships in my deck. The ships were lando in falcon x2 Gold Leader in gold 1 and red Leader in red 1.  Well I start the usually Yavin 4 stuff. He starts a surface defense and the 3 effects: Secret plans, Resistance, and There is no Try. Man I knew i was dead because he started resistance also. Well I started off the game by activating and deploying a nudj to the swamp. My draw was horrible I did not get any droids or inserts in my opening hand. I did get a lando in falcon and a landing claw so that can be good. I deploy the I move the nudj over to the swamp and draw up the force i have activated. Now i was mad because i still did not get one of my 7 droids in my deck or 1 of my inserts of the 6 in my deck. I felt this game was gonna be a loss because of the lack of inserts and everything i needed to run my deck. He goes and then draws up. I go and deploy my second nudj and draw up about 4 cards (I dont remember teh exact amount) YES!! i got 2 droids and an never tell me the odds. He goes activates his force and deploys kashyyk and kiffex. Now he saves up his force. I go and deploy my 2 droids (8d8 and artoo) and insert. He didnt have a torture so i was feeling pretty good to hit him with alot of force loss. He goes and i ask him to tell me how much he will activate before he starts just in case he is trying to cheat. The insert didnt pop up. He then deploys Dreadnaught to endor. Deploys a Vader with saber to endor platform. Deploys another dreadnaught to kashyyk. alright this can be good but i did not have any pilots to pilot my ship. So i go and activate. I send down a suicide obi with saber to fight off Vader. I go and hit vader and he hits obi and i draw a 2 and he draws a 1 so we just clear the board. He goes and only activates 4. He force drains me for 4 (Man where is my battle Plan). He deploys one last ship to kiffex. he now only has 1 force left. I go and activate and deploy my lando in falcon to endor. I put down a landing claw. I draw up the rest of my force. I ask how much are you gonna activate. He activates it all. The insert pops up and he only loses 2 because he had resistance. I attach during his control phase while he force drains me for 2 and 2 and the other 2 locations. I knew my life force will be depleted if i didnt do something fast. My inserts werent working so i gave up on them. I deployed obi with saber to farm and luke with saber to swamp (this took 2 turns) I battled the nudjs and got rid of them. I deployed battle plan so he had to pay to drain. He then hits me in the face with a homing beacon. My landing claw is canceled, but the minor catch was now he put down more ships to endor (devastator, 2 pilots) I put out a mantellian savrip and we started to have it out in space while i was force draining for 2 every turn to his 4. Well the game ended a close game. I lost by 11 force.<br>
FL 2(+15)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Making it a close game<br>
<br>
Low Lights: NOt getting an insert early<br>
            Not having many ships in my deck.<br>
<br>
Well it is the end of Round 1. The show up for the tournement was only like 65. I was still hoping i can go 5 wins and 1 loss but i will except 4 wins and 2 losses. My other friend that came with me is having a horrible day. He lost both of his first rounds. I brought this wooden bird with me. THe bird was a wood pecker that pecks down a metal pole. My friend claimed it bad luck and gave it back to me after the first 2 games. The friend i met here is doing as bad as he always does and he lost both of his games. He had no execuse except for that his decks were bad. I am hungry right about now, but i dont have enough time to eat so I hope I can eat a little later( it turns out I dont eat until about 11:00 at night and I am saying to myself 'man that was a good idea to get Mcdonalds earlier') Round 2 is gonna be starting.<br>
<br>
Game 3 Round 2  My ls vs Todd Theiner (1756) Court Deck.'<br>
<br>
I started the usual and he started Court of the vile gangster and twilleked for Bad Feeling have i. I am not gonna say this every time but every turn for about 5 turns he got out a docking bay with his objectiveThis game started off pretty bad. In my starting hand I did get a droid and an insert. The droid i got was 8d8. So i deploy my nudj, 8d8, and insert and draw up the rest of my force. ON his turn he activates 1 and plays an interrupt. The interrupt he plays is Look sir droids on my 8d8. That was disturbing for me. He continues his activation and draws up a couple and saves a couple. On my turn I deploy my second nudj and an artoo and save up the rest of my force because I have everything i think i need for a good suicide mission( I have obi with saber and Luke wit saber, and Leai with blaster) He goes and activates and deploys Darth Vader and his light saber, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Dr. Evazan(AHHH!!!). What a trio they are. On my turn i know i cant handled them so I deploy obi with saber and Luke with saber to audience chamber for a drain of 2. I draw up a couple. He goes and activates and NTMTOs pops up and he has to lose 5 force. He had no torture in his hand thankfully. Well the game started to speed up when he started to chase after me and draining me every turn. It was a drain race until the last couple of turns in which i deploy to a cantina that he deploys a 4 ability character to and battle it with leai. Since i drew a 1 and he draws a 4 he has more power then me so i can use mantellian savrip that i played that turn also. I had a drain of 2 at the cantina that i kept because he was using Walkers and Evazan, Tarkin, and vader were 3 sites away for a drain of 2. I go and hope he has no characters left so i deploy my tibrin with red leader in red 1. I deployed Battle Plan so now he had to start to pay for his drains (HEHEHE). Eventually He deployed a come here you big coward and a death star (that was a big mistake). I Moved over to the death star with a Lando in falcon that i deployed that turn. Since I have 2 battle grounds I can force Drain there. Eventually he picks up because he couldnt drain because of battle plan. I win by 6<br>
FW 4 (+21)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Having a really good close game<br>
            Pulling the game out of my ***<br>
Low LIghts: Look Sir Droids<br>
<br>
I had fun with that game. I then said since it was a miracle that i won It must of been the wood Pecker i had with me. Even though it probably wasnt but i would like to think so. WEll this game ended with 5 minutes left in the round so i still didnt have enough time to eat. OH well.<br>
<br>
Game 4 Round 2 My Ds Deck vs. Jared Napolitano's(1650) Y4 mains<br>
<br>
I went into this game pretty confident because if he was daring to play a numbers deck I was packing 5 tortures. Now if he was playing a mains deck I had I Have you now for a high power Vader. This game starts off slow for me because I got all red cards in my opening hand. Well Jareds first turn he deploys a nudj and 2 2/0 sites (DAMN). On my turn I activate 5 force look for the Dstar dockingbay because I started imperial arrest order. I draw and let him go. ON his turn he activates his 9 force and since he had force saved he goes and deploys Obi wan Kenobi with his saber, Wedge, and Orrimarko to the dstar dockinbay. Since I am lacking characters still he has a drain of 2. He draws up one of his cards and finds a transmission terminated and cancels visage ( i didnt cancel transmission with holonet transmission because it is hurting me more then him. I go and activate my force and draw (Finally I drew up 2 vaders, Mara Jade, Ig with gun. Now he goes and activates some more force and deploys more mains to the dstar. I was like man he must not have a battleground in his deck. He said he is sercuring the site. Well he couldnt get off of the site because I had Imperial Arrest Order out. Well he has a constant drain of 2 on me so I Decide to make this a drain race. I deploy Mara Jade and Vader Dlots to where a nudj is. I get maras saber and kill the nudj. I spread out so i have 1 drain of 3 at the farm and 1 drain of 2 at throne room. He has no characters left so i thought. He comes down to battle vader dlots with kal fal and tawws khaa. He iniates and BAM!! I choke tawws Khaa. He loses kal fal plus some. Here is where i caught the kid. He cheated me. Next turn he deployed kal fal and tawws again, but the ones he lost were not in his lost pile anymore. I dont call the kid on cheating becaus i wanted to win by myself. The game is a drain race. He has 1 drain of 2 to my total of 6. I win by 16<br>
FW 6 (+37)<br>
<br>
This game was over pretty quickly because we were both fast players. So that was a highlight<br>
<br>
Lowlights: The kid tried to cheat<br>
<br>
Well after the game I go around looking for my friends and My friend that came with me is now doing good. he won Game 3 and Game 4. My other friend only won 1 game. Still I did not have enough time to eat so I just toughed it out a bit. Well as of right now I am in the top 10 tables. So I was doing good. My goal for today was to go 4 wins and 2 losses , but I already have 3 wins so I only need 1 more win.<br>
<br>
Game 5 Round 3 My Ls vs Bob Catons Rops (1792)<br>
<br>
Well I went into this game thinking I was gonna do bad because my numbers deck has a hard time with Rops. Also I played his daughter Kim Caton at the big neutral ground tournement and was killed by her. So I was hoping I can give soem revenge back to her father. Well I start the usual and he starts Rops, ralttiir, and Bad Feeling Have I. Man I am gonna have a hard time to hit and run now. Well I go and get a pretty decent draw. I deploy a 8d8 and insert and deploy a nudj and a 2/0 site. I got a good hand. I draw up the rest of my force. Well Bob goes and gets out a site, a 2 generic sites. I go an activate all of my force I could Deploy an artoo (this insert is gonna hurt). He goes and activates WOW still no insert. He deploys Resistance, 3 2/2 guys flips. This can stink. I play Yoda Stew for more force. He wasnt expecting that. next turn i deployed some guys but i forgot who and hit him for 11 cards. From then on it was game for me. He had trouble recovering from that loss. So it was drain battle drain battle. I eventually came out ahead of the battling and drain game. I win by 23<br>
FW 8 (+60) <br>
<br>
Highlights: winning I have reached 4 wins and one loss I was sure i would have to play a good player next round. I also got my revenge<br>
<br>
Lowlights: None<br>
<br>
well I still didnt eat yet because I still didnt have much time. I was doing good. I still have that wood pecker. He is bringing me some luck I think.<br>
<br>
Game 6 Round 3 My ds vs. Patrick Ziagos (1821) HB REV OMDH<br>
<br>
Now that game was gonna be tough. After all Pat beat John Chu earlier in the tournement with this deck. Well my first turn I start Imperial Arrest Order over Sercurity Precautions because I have alot of Twileks and will eventually get it out. Well my first turn I activate and deploy Exec Dbay. I save my force. He goes and I twilek for a crush the rebellion. HE deploys alderaan. Yep now i knew it was OMDH. I go activate my force and draw some. He goes and sees the battle ground and deploys Obi with stick, and Luke with saber. I pull an I have you NOw out. Now he sees it. I go and deploy My DVDLOTS and marajade with stick. Oh yeah on his turn he revoed exec med chamber so i pulled an evader and canceled it but he grabbed my evader. I go deploy look for an I have you know so i have 2 incase 1 getrs sensed and i iniate. He misses Vader both times. YES!. I HIt Obi wan kenobi and draw my 3 destiny. I drew a 6 a 2 and a 1. He has 9 attrition. I have a power of 19 to his 12 he only drew a 2. So he loses both and i keep my characters. Now i have the site. He comes down again witha  luke with saber and a han with blaster. I Put all sections on alert Han when he iniated so he only gets 1 destiny. I play I have you know again. I choke Han and make luke forfit 0. I had power of like 20 to his 8 and he has to lose 12. The visage is still otu and he starts losing it. he had not much life force left so it was coming to an end.  The game eventually ended and i Won by 11<br>
FW 10 (+71)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Winning against a good player. <br>
Lows: After the game one of his friends told him YOU LOST TO A SCRUB. But he said other wise : )<br>
<br>
well the tournement is now at an end. I win 5 and lose 1. That is alot better then my last big tournement which was at NGround where i lost 4 and won 2. The final confrontation is now starting. Well I sit and watch it for a while and Twigg won the first game by about 10 and lost his nexyt game by like 21. So Chu wins Ramapo Again. I placed 6th (just made the mark to get some glass)<br>
<br>
Overall a very fun tournement all thanks to Scott Lingrell and all of the other people that helped out for it. I had alot of fun and didnt think I would place as high as I did.<br>
<br>
I also met the twiggs today. People dont seem to like them because they are loud but I didnt think they were that bad.<br>
<br>
YES Dennis and everyone you are gonna say something about that last comment but oh well.<br>
