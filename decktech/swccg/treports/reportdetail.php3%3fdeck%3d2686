Me and graham start driving up and i get pulled over by some shi.tty cop and he gives me a 100 dollar speeding ticket, and i wasn&#146;t even speeding that bad.  so i&#146;m running late and we get there right when the tournament is about to start.  I&#146;m playing HB flip done right for LS and MKOS for dark.<br>
<br>
game 1, DS vs Brian Herold&#146;s RST podracing (1790s)<br>
<br>
i spend the first couple turns setting up on Tatooine, get out mosep and gailid at the AC so he&#146;s losing 6 off the top every turn.  he wins the podrace, and he sets up his guys in the bunker ready to blow it up.  i come down with iggy, snoova with ax, Fett and some other guy to fight him.  he&#146;s cancelling one of my destinies with gen han and chewie and i&#146;m cancelling his destiny with myo, but i&#146;m drawing more battle destinies than he is and i&#146;ve got guys with guns so eventually i win the site, but he uses the explosive charges to clear the site.  he then comes down to AC with quigon, puts an explosive charge there, battles and then clears that site too.  i lose gailid and mosep but he&#146;s got so few cards in hand that i just spread out, i&#146;ve got guys at all 4 tatooine sites and a guy at back door and a guy at rebel landing site, and i drain him out before he draws for more guys.  win by 21.<br>
<br>
game 2, LS vs Jeff Kasper&#146;s BHBM (1700)<br>
<br>
he starts IAO, secret plans and YCHFE, so i start with sqassin, Strike planning, and DDTA for my third effect.  his first turn ds2 db comes out, emperor&#146;s power comes out and empy goes to the throne room.  my first turn since i drew gold squad 1 in hand i use it to pull nein nub from reserve and put them at rendezvou point and also pull endor.  his turn tempest scout 4 comes to endor db.  i debate whether i should go fight him because he has some pretty high destinies so i don&#146;t want luke to lose a lot of battles, but in the end i decide to go thru my deck for luke, throw him out with the scout walker, battle.  we tie in power so i don&#146;t have to stack and he lost one to empy&#146;s power and loses the walker.  meanwhile lando joins gold squad one and moves to endor and more systems come out of my deck.  next turn he puts blizzard scout one at the endor db.  i go after it with luke and get the same result, i don&#146;t have to stack and everyone dies.  eventually he gets out fett with gun and dr. e and i don&#146;t see any point in going after them since its only a drain of 1.  i get more ships out and flip, i got the mini falcon at kessel and wedge and tycho at endor.  now usually i would make my HB kessel so they have to come to the falcon and survive the barrier after they probe, but today i decided to make my HB corulag to hopefully confuse everyone.  well he gets out iggy and snoova at a generic db and puts down search and destroy.  i get obi down with those 2, battle, slice at snoova and hit him, he draws high enough with snoova&#146;s ax and decides to exclude obi instead of capturing him.  i got a on the edge and a houjix in my hand so i have no fear of what he&#146;s dropping next turn, the important thing is search and destroy is now cancelled.  he comes down with lord vader and saber next turn with obi and battles, he misses the swing, i hit iggy, and i don&#146;t draw enough to clear vader&#146;s immunity but he draws low too and i have no overflow.  i forget to give luke to vader so i take the 3 damage for 1 turn.  he gets out zuckuss at bothuwai and starts probing from there so i am force to have wedge and tycho meet zuckuss at corulag.  he probes it correctly but in the battle afterwards he draws a 3 and 5, the 5 is cancelled and he loses the battle by quite a few, while the 3 is not enough to beat my immunity.  he loses zuckuss and i leg. starfighter wedge.  the rest of the game involves me draining for 3 at kessel and 1 at endor and cancelling his drains with its a hit,  i get off 2 on the edges at the end and boost my diff. win by 22.<br>
<br>
game 3, DS vs Kasper&#146;s EBO kewtol.<br>
<br>
this game is short and sweet.  i don&#146;t have the cards for a turn 2 flip, and not finding the lower corridor prevents me from a turn 3 flip, so i am forced to set up on turn 4, which is ridiculously late for this deck. so i&#146;m set up with guys at 3 sites and mosep and gailid.  his turn he tunnle visions twice, gets out epp han and leia at the north ridge, and elis them over to the AC, battle.  i don&#146;t know what he was thinking but he miss both times with the blasters and i lose only ephant mon.  he has to lose one guy but not both so he loses han and moves leia over to JP.  well on my turn 5 guys come out and he loses 20 cards off the top, he spends the rest of the game drawing up, win by 28.<br>
<br>
game 4, LS vs Garret Larson&#146;s tat. mains  (1770)<br>
<br>
he starts court, mob points, and some other random effects.  so i have to pull out DDTA as my third effect.  his first turn he gets tatooine out and the stinger goes there, and he pulls the executor with mob points.  i ponder what he is doing &#146;cos he must noticed i started with squassin and strike planning right? :-)  i&#146;m guessing he&#146;s got a ghhhk in hand and hopes to lure me out and beat on the falcon with zuckuss next turn.  well i do get the falcon and drop them at tatooine, battle, he loses stinger and a couple more, and i move the falcon to rendezvou point.  so we both forget court the first turn.  his turn tempest one and igar comes out to the sarlaac pit.  my turn nein nub goes to falcon, i get Luke w/ saber to his AC, and the falcon moves to endor.  his turn jabba comes out of his reserve and ephant mon from his hand to the AC, he battles, swing at ephant and hit, since i cant target jabba.  so ephant is the only one that dies for him and luke dies.  my turn epp obi and luke come out, jabba ghhks and obi dies.  he gets out the executor at tatooine and moves piett up there.  my turn i get OTE out and puts down another obi and corran horn at the AC to back luke up.  eventually he gets out zuckuss and dengar at tatooine, and moves them over to endor, where i have falcon and pulsar skate.  i just drew wedge&#146;s ship for destiny the last turn, so i activate to it, draw it with mirax, finish activating, put wedge in his ship, and a xwing cannon on that.  battle and shoot down dengar, power pivot executor.  he loses dengar and everyone he had on the executor, while i lose no one.  leg. starfighter goes on the falcon.  his turn another couple pilots go to executor, he battles, draws a 6 so i have to lose lando to attrition while he loses the pilots and moves the executor back to tatooine.  i chase him and the lat. damage and ote damage eats into him, i also had HB flipped so he doesn&#146;t get any drains.  i win by 19 or so.<br>
<br>
game 5 vs Scott Poster&#146;s HD racing (1910)<br>
<br>
i start with YISYW for his inserts, first turn my honor comes out, a couple turns later his no escape responds and we both start losing to visage.  but i have an early TT for his visage.  he wins the podrace on like the 4th turn and i have no It could be worse in hand so i lose the full 11.  but i had 4 systems out and another one in hand so i was in no danger of not being able to flip HB.  after he wins vader comes out to the podrace arena and another visage goes down, but before it can go a full turn corran horn also goes down and cancels it.  mean while i&#146;m draining for 5 total at kiffex and kessel, i don&#146;t drain at the holotheater for fear of counter assault.   he&#146;s doing no damage to me.  zuckuss comes down to kiffex, i barrier and beat him down with wedge and dash next turn, but he just ghhhks.  a couple turns later fett in slave one goes to bothawui and probes, barrier again, and i move my falcon to corulag because if he probes correctly i want to be able to at least get Leg. Starfighter in play.  he moves fett to my corulag but forgets to probe during my deploy phase! so leg. starfighter comes down &#146;cos fett gets beaten on, and lando goes back to kessel.  he has one more ship but cannot draw it so i win.  win by 15.<br>
<br>
game 6 vs Scott Poster&#146;s WYS<br>
<br>
my first turn i go look for a sail barge and notice that a zuckuss is in my force pile... and i already had 4 lom and iggy in hand, so i just pull hutt influence and draw for the zuckuss.  his first turn dash in outrider and a RFC goes to kessel.  well my turn zuckuss 4-lom and iggy pays them a visit and i clear his guys out, but the ship stayed.  my next turn i had all 3 JP sites out already and there were 3 things i could do to search my reserve, use AC&#146;s text, use JP&#146;s text, or use Power of the Hutt.  well i didn&#146;t want to use AC&#146;s text before i saw what was in there, and using JP&#146;s text meant he got to verify automatically, so i decide to use power of the hutt, well theres nothing in there except the sail barge but no site so i&#146;m forced to deploy the sail barge by itself.  his turn wedge and a rfc come down in pulsar skate, and JK Luke goes to the outrider.  he battles, i get 3 destiny and it clears wedge and the rfc, but luke stays, while i lose iggy to attrition.  he&#146;s got no force left to run away. i get bossk in ship out and clear out luke and the outrider, and my ships move back to tatooine for bigger drains.  his turn he flips with luke, rfc and owen+beru at the farm, and mirax at kessel.  i use my turn to set up the JP sites with some gailid action.  he starts harvesting every turn and i can&#146;t find secret plans or grabber to stop him.  eventually i get guri in stinger and move the ships over to kessel to stop the drain.  his turn han comes out to the db, melas to the cantina, and luke goes to han&#146;s site, and his ships run to tatooine.  my turn i follow his ships to tatooine, and the turn after that Guri in stinger lands at the db, my sail barge goes to the farm and the guys on board gets off and marches over to the db.  he battles me on his turn, shoots somebody, and loses luke to the damage.  i&#146;m left with snoova, abyssin and guri and ship at the site, not enough for battle destiny.  my turn myo goes to the cantina, battles melas, retrives, and goes to my used pile.  my ships follow him to kessel, guri takes off to tatooine, abyssin goes to moisture farm, gets on the sail barge, and drives it back to the db where snoova gets on too. his turn a RFC joins han, he battles and then as a just action goes to play a I have a bad feeling about this from his lost pile.  i tell him that he has to play I have a bad feeling before the battle, and i make him go thru his lost pile for another interrupt he could play.  well the only one he could play was control/tunnle, the bad thing for him is that it was stacked and he had just 2 force left, so he had to pay for the control tunnel and then he didn&#146;t have a force pile to use it on.  so he shoots abyssin and hits, but he has only one card left in reserve, so i lose snoova too but the sail barge stays, while he gets out powered by 4 or so so he loses the RFC.  he also starts a battle at kessel and reduces zuckuss&#146;s power, but i get 3 destinies and i have jabba and bib out so i clear out the majority of his guys, i cancel one of his destinies with myo and lose bossk to attrition.  my turn the myo i used goes to the db on the sail barge, i battle and retrive.  he shoots myo and hits, while i outpower him by 4 again so he loses han.  i chase his ships and draw into a Prince Xizor and hold it up so that the crowd of people that gathered to watch our game could see.  i think Scott got psyched out by this &#146;cos he forgot to drain next turn, when he played harvest i finally grabbed it and then xizor goes to the cantina with melas and kills him off.  so now his ships are just running away from zuckuss and guri everyturn in space, and the only characters he has on the ground are beru and owen and a RFC at the LMF, so he draws up before i can retrive more.  win by 15.<br>
<br>
so i win the tournament, and i take the It could be worse foil, but the funny thing is after that they did a random drawing for the twilek foil and i got that too.  other people weren&#146;t too happy but i take it as my consolation for the 100 dollar ticket.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=2686"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=2686"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
