<br>
I am typing this without any spell checks, my hands are just flying across the keyboard so I might have bad grammer as well, but you know what?... I don&#146;t give a fuk so get over it.<br>
<br>
Well I would start off with the flight to Chicago, but I won&#146;t hehe... Matt Berta and I was the only ones from Vegas that is going to make the trip.  In Fact we were the only ones from Tatooine to play in the tournament.  One thing I need to say Mad Props to Shane Watner, and Dan Christy... Thanks Shane for giving me a ride to the Airport and picking me up on the way back.  OK so in Chicago Matt and I rent a cheap car, and Drive to Normal which is about 2 hours away.  We arrive early which is fine, except now we wait until the Warm up Tourney.<br>
<br>
No details for the Warm up tourney, I went like 2-2 with not the real decks, but oh well.  It was fun.  Matt and I are staying at Geoff Snider&#146;s house this weekend, so him being a local here we were ready to have some fun.  Which we did.  On Friday Night Geoff, Girard, Chris Hunter, Scott Lingrell, Matt, and I went out... Brenston started to but changed his mind.  We went to some club called Rocky&#146;s... which was Minibopper if you ask me, since they allowed 18 in up in the bar.  Scott was wondering who would jump the 16 year old first... hehe no not really.. (cough)  Geoff was drinking beer like water, and I was drinking Sambuca like water... with beer as well.  Girard was tearing up the dance floor, and Matt was stalling on his beer drinking.  This is still Normal IL so that means things close early here. (Special NOTE: VEGAS is open 24/7) After all this drinking and having fun we head for FOOD.  Which we all needed.  Geoff like knows every person everywhere in this town, so we go to this Pizza place through the back door. Back door heh.. good Idea.  Geoff gives everyone a free soda, and mine is spike with Rum, like I really needed more to drink, and we eat some of the greasiest( I know that is not a word) pizza every.. it was good :)  Finally time to go home, and Girard drives for me, because I cannot... and we arrive and Geoff has like 20 people staying at his place.  Geoff breaks out some cards for the Secret Squirrel game, and find a spot on the floor, and Geoff gives me a beer from his frig, and I Tech out my decks for the next day... which is only a few hours away, and I pass out on the floor.<br>
<br>
Tourney Time:<br>
OK  I decided to go with my &quot;WYS stay balanced&quot; witch has not lost yet in Tourney play.  And a Teched out BHBM deck.  Which probably shouldn&#146;t have been played but oh well.  I didn&#146;t take notes, and some people I don&#146;t remember they name.. so here it goes.<br>
<br>
Game 1 MY DS vs Philippe Parise Real Hidden base<br>
<br>
OH goodie first game I get to play someone I know instead of a complete stranger.  Philippe is cool, and is a pretty good player.  I am so tired and still feeling the effects from the night before, so here I am letting him do things he is not supposed to do.  For to many turns he was draining for more than 1 at systems without HB being flipped.  I know he wasn&#146;t doing it on purpose, because he hasn&#146;t played for awhile, and I am such a scrub, that I say it is my fault not his.  It was like at least 6 extra lost cards if I remember correctly, but oh well.  He puts everyone undercover at my drain sites, and I cannot find my killers for that.  I do set up Search and Destroy however, and he doesn&#146;t get luke out the lost is going back and forth.  But in the end he drains my out with that Kessel Drain, and I lose by 5<br>
FL by 5<br>
0(-5)<br>
<br>
Highs: I am starting to wake up.. I guess?<br>
Lows: I am a Scrub.. I should have known my cards.. who knows if it would have made a difference..  Losing my first game.. yuck.<br>
<br>
Game 2 MY LS vs some guys Court deck.<br>
<br>
OK I need to win games by big diff, because I lost my first one.  I try to play with the cards I draw, and stop drawing unless I have to.  I had everything I needed this game.  He puts Zuchass out early but against Outerrider, but I have I&#146;ll take the leader out so I still win back with a zero desting.  Next turn I deploy Falcon, and win he loses Zuchass, I deploy Legendary Starfighter... He is playing for Battle plan I am not... I win easly, and very fast.<br>
FW by 30<br>
2(+25)<br>
<br>
Highs:Winning big.. and I am getting tired of these Highs and Lows part...<br>
Lows: Winning so fast means I have a longer time to wait for the next game.<br>
<br>
Game 3 MY DS vs someguys TIGIH<br>
<br>
I have never lost to this kind of deck, but this game I suck.  He wins some random battles, I duel him one time with track destiny&#146;s to make him lose 3 force everyturn.  Well on one duel he play Smokescreen to cancel my destiny, and I have to stack a card, which gives him enough to turn Vader if he draws a 6 so he trys, and shuffles, and I cut, and guess what.. he draws a 6... Sh1t.. just like that I lose all life force, and I thought we still had at least another 20 minutes of going back and forth.  Oh well<br>
FL by 15<br>
2(+10)<br>
<br>
No more highs and Lows.. I getting lazy<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 MY LS vs someguys ISB.. anti WYS<br>
<br>
OK he has ISB with Imperial commands and a Space drain set up.  It look like a pretty good deck, but When he went to look for an Admiral, I grabbed that card.  That made him a little on the defense.  He plays Something special planned also, but that doesnt&#146; mean anything for me, I just played retrieval as needed.  I win a few battle in space, and then he wins a few in space.  My foifet of my smug&#146;s are huge so he seems to be losing my than me.  I win.<br>
FW by 21<br>
4(+31)<br>
<br>
Game 5 MY DS vs Martin Paquette HB Beats<br>
<br>
He was playing the same deck Yannick was playing.  When he went to go look for a system and missed.. I saw he had nothing but beat down.  It look like almost every destiny adder there.  So I knew I had to act fast.  I put Vader out early, to take Luke from him, because some adders wouldn&#146;t work with out Luke, but he never gave me Luke so he loses 3 a turn... I grabb ICBW early, and start to look for my other grabber for Yoda&#146;s stew, but never find it.  I leave Emperor only witch is a huge mistake, but with the Deploy +2 for his characters, the emperor is safe.  I also use Used Monnok on him a couple of time to keep him slowed down, but he did grab my monnok. I kept all my force at one site on purpose, so it was a long game.  We came close to time by I win.<br>
FW by 21<br>
6(+52)<br>
<br>
So I am like 3-2 at this point, and I think that 6-2 can make it if I the diff is good.<br>
<br>
Game 6 MY LS vs Yannick Lapointe MKOS<br>
<br>
OK... This game was close, we were going back and forth with retrieving.  He grab my cards early since he was playing with 3 grabbers.  During one battle he plays Set for Stun twice, to remover people... I should have grabbed that card, but anyway... it made a huge difference in the game.  Later he tells me, that the card cost 3 force, and not 2, but he didn&#146;t mean to do that.  Once again I take the blame for not knowing my cards.  So my WYS deck takes its first tourney lost to a great player.<br>
FL by 11<br>
6(+41)<br>
<br>
Oh well now there is no chance for me, I might as well just try to have a decent finish.<br>
<br>
Game 7 MY LS vs Super staller playing Huntdown Ties.<br>
<br>
Well this guys is playing Ties, the cheap ln&#146;s and replacing them with squadrons, and bringing them out again, and you should get the point.  He is retrieving like crazy, I am makeing him lose to Legendary, and OTE, drains.  I am celebrating, but with this match up I can not get a FW in one hour.  I ask him to draw up, because he is clearly going to lose the game, but he doesn&#146;t.  Time is called and THAT HAS GOT TO S U C K.  Truth be told I need another 10 minutes to win the game because of his retrival, but It should have still been a FULL WIN.. I hate timed out games.<br>
TW by 28<br>
7(+69)<br>
<br>
I am PISSED after this game.<br>
<br>
Game 8 My DS vs Corey Foherty&#146;s WYS<br>
<br>
Well I haven&#146;t played against WYS all day today. He sets up at Kessel pretty early and I take that drain, almost all game.  Let me just get to the game winning moment.  I have Vader Dactha(yes) Dactha.. which earlier he was used to make Corey spend two force, so he couldn&#146;t play the It&#146;s a Trap in his hand witch in turn made me beat him down.  But anyway on to the battle.  He has Talon, Wedge, and Chewie in the Cantina.  I have Choke Vader and Dactha, and Mara with Saber.  I deploy Blast door controls..then Deploy Ig-88.  I battle first I choke Chewie, even with Talon extra help, then I capture Wedge, and then I slice up Talon, and draw a 4 and 6 for destiny... I got the extra destiny from the Emperor&#146;s power... He had to lose like 19 cards plus Talon, which was game.  He started to look for his Houjix in his lost pile but it wasn&#146;t there.  I win after suffering one more drain from kessel.<br>
FW by 6<br>
<br>
Well it is over and I have a score of :<br>
9(+75)<br>
<br>
Which ends up being in 25th place.  If I didn&#146;t TIME OUT in one game... don&#146;t get me started on that... but if I didn&#146;t it would have been(should have been) 10+75.. with a respectable 14th place in between Dom and Yannick.  Oh well tell me to get over it.  I had a lot of fun either way, and Will try to make every DPC in the future... it is that good.<br>
<br>
