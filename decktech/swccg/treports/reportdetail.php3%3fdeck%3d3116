The evening before the tournament I stayed over at my friend Robbie&#146;s house, to test out decks and such. My decks were pretty tight, and he liked the way he had his, so we just played a few games and did a little tweaking. We then played some N64 smash bros, and I taught him how to play starcraft on the PC. We bedded down earlier than usual, around midnight, so we were ready for blood the next day. <br>
<br>
We got up around 8:00; less sleep then I usually like, but more than i usually get. :o) The tournament was about an hour away, in anniston, and it was scheduled to start at 11:30, so we left around 9:30 to swing by my house and pick up my brothers; then headed down to the tournament. We get there about 11:15 and are greeted by Larry (never have found out his last name, somehow...), the storeowner; and Jeff Anderson, the TD. We learn that a large turnout is not expected, seeing that the players Jeff sometimes brings with him from Georgia are unable to attend. However, me, Robbie, and my brothers make 4 by ourselves, and a few more come in, so we end up with enough for sanctioned. :o) Before the tourney starts, we chat with Jeff for a bit while he attempts to ascertain whether or not he completed the set of R3 premiums from 3 boxes. He tells us about his recent playing adventures on the west coast, and displays his awe for the new R3 objectives. He tells us about the mad dueling skills of his QMC deck, that 4 good players dueled against him in tourneys in San Diego, and they all lost the duels. Now, this frightens me slightly, cause I am playing dueling hunt down. Jeff then builds decks with the 2 new R3 objectives, the LS being only slightly modified from his aforementioned QMC. This scares me even more, because I am playing decks without any R3 cards (dang expensive crap). Also, I&#146;ve never played against the lightsaber combat objectives, and they are supposed to own, so i think ah well, that&#146;s the end of it for me. Then the 6-game tourney commences.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
My(Steven Tubbs&#146;) DS HDADTJ Dueling vs my brother John&#146;s semi-old school profit.<br>
<br>
John is only 9 years old, and I built his deck. So I begin the game with somewhat of an advantage. John is, however, the best 9-year-old SWCCG player in the world, and he beats me often, so i do not underestimate him. I start Mara and Evazan/Ponda Baba for my 2 aliens, and I get to deploy EPP vader to Tatooine: Jabba&#146;s palace first turn. He drops LS, RS with lightsaber, lightsaber prof, and meditation. He wants me to battle luke. Next turn, I use Masterful Move to grab the phantom menace, then deploy it, tatooine Maul, and Maul&#146;s lightsaber to Jabba&#146;s palace and oblige him with the battle. I swing and miss luke. He swings at vader, and somehow gets exactly 6 for his destiny even with the mediation bonus. We are both surprised. I chop Luke with my next swing. I play I Have You Now. I get three battle destinies, and he gets 2. I lose Vader, he loses Luke and like 11 force. My next turn I deploy another EPP Vader. The rest of the game goes downhill for poor john. Mara and Evazan/ponda hold the audience chamber unmolested the whole game, and he loses to visage, and Maul-Vader draining at Jabba&#146;s palace. He cancels visage with TT once, then once with Corran horn. He gets a nice drain the rest of the game at meditation chamber. Sucks. But I drain at Jabba&#146;s palace, the holotable (image of the dark lord, good stuff), and at Carida with Zuckuss for a long time. I drain more than him, and he can&#146;t flip his objective, so I win in a bit.<br>
<br>
FW{2} (+22)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My WYS vs John&#146;s SPEED DEAL<br>
<br>
John is good at playing speed deal. second turn every game. trooper beats. CC occupation. raw pain. But I have menace fades, which i set up fast. :o) John doesn&#146;t like menace fades. ask him. he will gladly express his feelings on the subject. Since he can&#146;t drain for much on CC, he comes to Tatooine and tries to do things to my gay destiny-adding forfeit-pumped smugglers, but he is unsuccessful for the most part I get tat celebration going, and use on the edge a couple of times. i use the AO to drain some at the docking bays, and captain Han sits at Kessel the whole game. I like Kessel. Kessel is my kinda place. dark, rocky, uncomfortable. Spooky, slightly disturbing. why the heck you can drain for three there i dunno. but it&#146;s cool anyway. He deploys CC occupation once, but i cancel it with free ride/endor celebration. that is a great card. i love that card. If I ever had to choose between that card and a girl, i would choose the girl. but it&#146;s still an awesome card. :o) I cause more damage than him, and my flamingly gay smugglers beat off his attacks. I win.<br>
<br>
FW{2} (+23)<br>
<br>
4 +45<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
My Hunt Down vs Jeff Anderson&#146;s R3 objective.<br>
Jeff is a good player, he&#146;s been playing since the game was young. He directed the first 3-4 tournaments I ever attended. He = cool. I am very worried this game. Games like this make me nervous, when I don&#146;t know if i&#146;m gonna win or lose. I dont&#146; know what the objective or any of his stuff does, so he is patient as I read it all and figure out what the frick i&#146;m gonna do about it. Then we get started. For the first and only time ever, I do not draw EPP vader in my starting hand while playing this deck. I am flabbergasted. But I do get maul and his saber. that is nice. I deploy maul with saber to the wonderfully cool new 3/2 site. I like the idea of draining for 4. it&#146;s all good. Maul doesn&#146;t flip my objective though, so we both lose to visage. dangit. His turn, he deploys the R3 Obi-wan to maul, and stacks a combat card. Visage. My turn, i deploy Iggy with riot gun, and battle. Iggy with riot gun is my new hero, by the way. he is the greatest card ever. Jeff plays smoke screen and some other interrupt as just actions(dunno if smoke screen is a just action, but i don&#146;t care.), and I try to shoot ability 6 Obi with the Riot Gun of Impending Doom. I draw the Circle is Now Complete. Sweet irony. obi captured, combat cards go somewhere, (used ple, lost pile, dunno exactly. not sure what&#146;s supposed to happen to them), his &#146;just&#146; interrupts are lost, and battle is over. I drain him for 4 force at that site the rest of the game. I get vader there my next turn, and emperor there a few turns later. I drain there, and at the holotable(image of the dark lord owns all). he loses a lot to visage. he cancels visage with jar-jar and mirax. they drain me some. i don&#146;t like that, so i deploy mara after a bit and kill them both. mara sits and does nothing. i drain some more. I deploy bad feeling have I at some point, which hurts him badly, because he&#146;s having trouble managing his force with the huge damages he&#146;s taking, and can&#146;t activate enough to draw and deploy the beatdown crews he has floating in his deck. He keeps talking about his guys he&#146;s trying to get to kill me with, but obi is already down, and I don&#146;t know what else he could be wanting to attack three dark jedi with... but whatever. Corran and Qui-gon come down and attack mara. he swings his beefy lightsaber. I cancel it with force field. everyone in the room thinks that is just cool. i swing, and chop qui-gon. I have great destinies in this deck. :oD his battle destiny isn&#146;t enough to dislodge my girl Mara, and mine is a ZERO. the only zero in the deck at the moment is CARIDA. it wouldn&#146;t even have been in there except for his WACK Don&#146;t Do That Again defensive shield... Grr... oh well. anyway, next turn i battle corran with mara, and Weapon levitation rears it&#146;s gay head as corran steals our favorite girl&#146;s saber. Now, Jeff says corran is allowed to swing the saber, now that he&#146;s stolen it. I disagree, because I remember reading something on the listserve about people using stolen sabers that are restricted in their deployment...but i don&#146;t really mind, and he IS the TD, so he swings and hits mara with her stolen saber. (this will come up again later) they both die. I continue to drain at the stupid naboo interior site. he deploys yoda and panaka at some point. He tries to grab some SAC to cancel my bad feeling. he can&#146;t find any. Yoda and Panaka take on the Sith Triad. They get owned. I win after a bit.<br>
<br>
FW{2} (+22)<br>
<br>
6 (+67)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My WYS vs Justin Crook&#146;s Watto fakeout<br>
<br>
Justin is a good player, last time i played him a year ago, we split 2 games in a tournament. I don&#146;t know why he&#146;s not actually using the backside of his objective... It&#146;s just so cool, but he never flips the thing. He explains how he&#146;s just using it for activation and etc. sounds like a good idea, but whatever. I use tatooine celebration (LOVE that card) and drain in space. We have lotsof skirmishes on the ground, and the gayness of WYS owns his 273 characters that try to kill me. He plays with lotsof characters, by the way. but they all die. He plays good. I have like 12 characters in the deck, and I still win tons of battles. And he doesn&#146;t play badly. He makes good decisions and everything. He just can&#146;t get anywhere. It&#146;s wack. WYS is just awesome. It provides tons of  resiliency and power previously found only in mains, to little piddly scrub characters. and they end up being better than mains.  Anyway, i abuse on the edge/WYS late game, and win by a lot.<br>
<br>
FW{2} (+32)<br>
<br>
8 (+99)<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 7<br>
My WYS vs Jeff Anderson&#146;s DS lightsaber combat<br>
This is a wack game. He deploys maul like first turn, with his double-bladed saber. I drop down luke with saber, lando ECC, and some scrub smuggler to battle him. I have han in the falcon at tattooine as well, so I flip my broken objective. I initiate the battle, and play weapon lev from lost pile to steal his saber. ( I do not realize until after the game is over that mauls saber cannot be stolen...i kinda feel bad about it, cause it was a close game, and that really hurt bad. but i really didn&#146;t know. :o( ) Now, using Jeff&#146;s ruling from our previous game, I swing maul&#146;s own lightsaber at him, and kill him. I think there was someone else there as well, but they weren&#146;t important, cause i don&#146;t remember who they were. :o) anyway, i get lot of battle destinies, and maul dies from his saber wounds, and the scrub dies from attrition. I use tatooine celebration a lot that game, and he blocks my drain at the reactor with arica. I have no anti-undercover spy stuff. I&#146;m gonna change that. He dumps down Fett in slave one, and bossk in hounds tooth, and zuckuss in his bubble onto han in the falcon and mirax in her ship at tatooine.  sucks. he draws 2 battle destiny and i get 0. I forfeit han and the falcon and lose 2 force. :o) Next turn, i deploy my second han and second falcon to the tatooine docking bay, and move over a smuggler pilot from the cantina to satisfy zuckuss. i take off into the battle-torn sky above tatooine, and i hope he battle me, since i have &quot;punch it!&quot; in my hand and the admiral&#146;s order(makes all ships without pilot characters aboard power -2) on table. he doesn&#146;t battle me. very tragic. he moves his cowardly bounty hunter ships to kessel. he sits there the rest of the game. i sit at tatooine to keep celebration the rest of the game. I retrieve lot of force, and he can&#146;t damage me much, and i&#146;m not damaging him much. time is called. we count up, and he has like 14 cards left and i have 27. <br>
<br>
<br>
timed win{1} (+27)<br>
<br>
9 (+126)<br>
<br>
Game 8<br>
My WYS(again????)vs Cory(dangit, sorry dude, i forget your last name)&#146;s BHBM<br>
I just realized i played light 4 times. dunno if that&#146;s supposed to happen, but oh well. i would&#146;ve won this game with light or dark. Also, Justin figures out before the game that even if i lose by 60, i will still win the tournament. that is cool. Corey is playing BHBM, one of my favorite DS decks ever. He does the normal formerly broken BHBM starting stuff, and after a few turns walks vader and other people down into the cantina. Kir Kanos sits at a docking bay alone. Smugglers stomp his butt. Kir and 11. EPP luke sits at his forest clearing, han sits at kessel, and dash sits at tatooine. assorted smugglers sit at a docking bay on tatooine. they all drain for a lot, and I get tatooine celebration(B-R-O-K-E-N) flowing. I drain him away and win with no cards in my lost pile. <br>
<br>
FW{2} (+33)<br>
<br>
11 (+159)<br>
<br>
<br>
I go undefeated, and win the tournament. I am ecstatic. It&#146;s the first tournament i&#146;ve ever won, and I went undefeated in SIX games. I won by 22 or more every game. I am an unstoppable machine. :oD Even though there weren&#146;t any really high-rated players playing, i&#146;m still proud of myself. ;o) <br>
<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
To Jeff Anderson, for directing the tournament. <br>

to me for being a moron and stealing maul&#146;s lightsaber when i&#146;m not supposed to.<br>

To me, for not dueling a single time with hunt down.<br>
To somehow playing light side a 4th time. i wanted to play hunt down again. :o( <br>
<br>
