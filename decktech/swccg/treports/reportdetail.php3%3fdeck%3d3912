<br>
<br>
This was my last tournament before I left for college, and my fourth ever.  I wanted to leave a lasting impression on the guyz before I left, hopefully winning this one.  I had improved my 2 decks even further, the only 2 I have been able to play because I don’t have the cards to build others, yet.  <br>
<br>
SYCFA flip and LSC have been doing extremely well for me so far.  The last tournament I went 3-1, giving me a .500 win/lose percentage for the summer.  My current rating is 1613.  Not bad for someone who just started playing in tourneys.  I was hoping to improve on that, not going undefeated exactly, but hoping for a first place finish.  <br>
<br>
I knew it was going to be extremely difficult as Brad Vogel is the #1 player around here.  SWCCG is all about fun though, even if you don’t win… but its always nice give someone a beating now and then… right? lol<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 1:  my SYCFA flip (1613) vs. Wayne Cullen’s TRM (1611)<br>
<br>
This was hilarious because Wayne and I have play tested these 2 decks against each other so many times that we have put in cards to help specifically against each other.  Overall our decks are 2-2 vs. each other, but I am 2-0 in tourney play. ¦Þ<br>
<br>
Wayne started off fast, but so did I. I pulled one of the 2 superlasers in my deck on the opening hand and moved it to parsec 2 in two turns.  I didn’t even deploy the war room because he always seems to have Corran Horn with him and beat down my gunners.  Instead I deployed Blizzard 4 to the docking bay, and Vader w/stick for free.  Then deploying my gunners and moving Vader off blizzard 4 at the end of my turn.  I figured if he wanted to stop me from blowing up Alderaan so bad I’d make him pay for it the hard way. <br>
<br>
I blew it up on turn 4 and starting deploying to space.  I pulled Bespin and the effect to drop executor for free, along with Kuat and KDY to deploy from reserve. I was deploying and retrieving with no problem, force draining for about 9 a turn.  He would have been losing more force, but altered my FWKTIL.  He won the podrace and killed me for 6 while he retrieved. <br>
<br>
It was a closer game than it might have looked from the overall ending.  We had already knew each others decks and strategies and it was fun to play against him again.  We both knew it could have gone either way. I ended up winning by 22 or 23 force, I forget. <br>
<br>
HIGH: winning the first game and off to a good start<br>
LOW: playing the same match up so many times<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 2: my LSC (1613) vs. Greg Zinn’s Blizzard deck (1592)<br>
<br>
We both started off pretty quickly, I was set up at Naboo’s 3 sites in about 4 turns draining for as much as possible.  He set up at Hoth and I was losing to direct walker damage and some force drains.  He deployed the system as well as a walker, with Ozzel and Igar aboard.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the game, I deployed p*ssed off Lando to a single walker, which he barriered.  Then he played ice storm, making him lost.  He was able to drain there again.  I wasn’t losing as much damage as I could have with Honor out.  It was getting to be the end of the game when we had a huge space battle.<br>
<br>
I deployed HCandFalcon to hoth but didn’t battle against Chimaera with a few pilots.  The next turn he initiated a battle, and I interrupted with Life Debt and Punch it!  He interrupted with imperial command which I sensed, so I drew 6 BD. I ended up pulling a total of 29 BD, beating him down in space pretty bad.  He just forfeited everyone, letting me control Hoth and satisfying battle plan.  <br>
<br>
I ended up winning by 31 by out draining him and retrieving with rebel reinforcements and noble sacrifice.<br>
<br>
HIGH: pulling 6 BD for 29 total attrition and retrieving at the end of the game… <br>
LOW: putting all my characters at Naboo and not attempting to find Han in the blizzard<br>
<br>
It was all looking good… so far… <br>
<br>
GAME 3: my SYCFA flip (1613) vs. Brad Vogel’s LSC (1935)<br>
<br>
Brad was the one person I didn’t want to play, but ya gotz to beat the best to become the best.  I love my SYCFA flip, but it happens to have some slow starts which is hard to come back from.  Overall, including the end of the this match, it is 4-3. Not bad, and tons of fun to play.<br>
<br>
I ended up getting off to a slow start.  OF COURSE!! Why not get a slow start against the #1 player in our area. Why not? lol.  Anywayz he started racing and I lost the podrace.  I didn’t have any trouble blowing up Alderaan by turn 5, which isn’t too bad, but definitely not the fastest either.  The problem was I couldn’t find the star destroyers in the deck.  He was killing me with drains for 6 a turn.  He was playing space and I couldn’t get over to him in time to kill him.<br>
<br>
He played battle plan, so my drains were costly until I finally got a few star destroyers out.  I definitely messed myself up though, while trying to pick up and find ships in my reserve, I wasn’t counting and by the time I finally got another one I didn’t have enough force to deploy it and retrieve.  I was kicking myself so hard.  His deck was fast and well constructed.  I didn’t have much of a chance by the middle of the game, and he was retrieving without a problem.<br>
<br>
I finally got over to him, where he just demolished me by deploying massive space and making me forfeit my guyz. <br>
<br>
He ended up winning by 32. A horrible game that I wish I could have had back.  Everything basically went wrong, but what can ya do? I was disappointed that my deck didn’t perform as well as the first game earlier that day… <br>
<br>
HIGH: I don’t really think there was one to be honest… <br>
LOW: messing up, slow start, and putting the chances of first place out of reach<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 4: my LSC vs. Brian Zinn’s SYCFA non-flip (1646)<br>
<br>
As of right now, there were 3 people in the tourney who were still undefeated.  Brad Vogel, Brian Zinn, and Sam Diamond.  I figured the best I could do was prolly 3-4 place.  I wanted to redeem myself for the last game and get as high a place as possible, because the rares from the Theed box we opened were awesome.  We got a Maul and Qui w/saber, Darth Sidious, and 2 AI’s. <br>
<br>
I had never played Brian before in any of the previous 3 tourneys.  He was racing and started on my turn.  I began deploying people to Naboo as usual.  He met me there with his people which I stayed away from using blast the door kid and such.  He managed to kill a few of my guyz early with Miyoon because I couldn’t deploy them fast enough.<br>
<br>
I put down Obi’s Apparition to limit his force activation, and when he was only activating 15 force I put 17 cards in hand to get the guyz I wanted to deploy so he couldn’t take them from my hand and put them in the lost pile.  <br>
<br>
I dueled him a few times but was never able to make it 5 or greater. I always pulled an 11 or 12 duel destiny with only one card stacked because he had the shield, but he pulled good destiny as well.  He lost about 12 force from duels with Qui Gon, but gave me a hard time on the ground.  <br>
<br>
Then I deployed HCandFaclon to Alderaan and moved them over the Death Star where I added to my drains for 2 turns.  He then deployed Zuckuss but didn’t draw good BD and we both just forfeited our ships in space.  The game was all about controlling ground which he had me on the run for.  He battled me a few times where I used Run Luke Run a few times, but eventually lost luke because he cancelled my immunity to attrition with 4-lom w/gun.  <br>
<br>
I kept on force draining with Leia and Lando and eventually it took its toll.  I ended up winning by about 26 Force.<br>
<br>
HIGH: won even though couldn’t win by &lt;5 on the duels… <br>
LOW: almost got my @$$ kicked by Zuckuss, which could have hurt.<br>
<br>
It was a great tourney.  I ended up getting 2 place overall with my 3-1 record.  Brad Vogel took first, so I didn’t feel so bad losing to him as bad as I did.  It was good to get in a tourney 3 days before I left for school. <br>
<br>
<br>
PROPS:<br>
Wayne – winning his last game of the tourney so he didn’t go defeated<br>
The guy (don’t know his name) – big trade<br>
Brad – lending me the card I needed<br>
Greg – also lending me a card that I needed<br>
Sam – trading at the end <br>
<br>
***** Brad and everyone for planning a tourney when I come home from school and am available… thanx fellas… that’s awesome. I appreciate it MUCHO!! <br>
<br>
SLOPS:<br>
Wo@#$%a - where were you man? lol<br>
Me – messing up against brad… arrrggghhh… <br>
<br>
<br>
Great tourney guyz… can’t wait till the next one!! Ill be back and ready to kick some @$$!!! ¦Þ hopefully... lol<br>
