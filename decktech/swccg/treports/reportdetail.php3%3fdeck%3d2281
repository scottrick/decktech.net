to see who&#146;s #1.  The championship was run at A-1 Comics in Roseville,<br>
not far from Sacramento.  Mike Hardy was to be the TD.<br>
<br>
So I hook up with Nick Stefanko and his station wagon in Pleasanton &amp;<br>
make the trip to Roseville with his brother, Alfred Dong (who I <br>
predicted would win the championship), Steve Daniel, and Andrew Meewis.<br>
It was by far the most uncomfortable trip of my life, sitting in back <br>
on a ROCK HARD seat, and virtually no room at all for my legs.  It was<br>
absolutely unbearable, and I would not sit in that station wagon ever<br>
again.<br>
<br>
I&#146;m still in final exam mode, but had managed to find time to modify my<br>
decks somewhat.  I had been using EBOX and Hunt Down w/unique TIEs, but<br>
changed them.  My LS was still EBO, but using Mon Cal Cruisers instead,<br>
and more EPP mains to fight on land more effectively.  My DS was still<br>
Hunt Down, but I ditched the space power and went for ground beats.  I<br>
used several bounty hunters, All Wrapped Up, and Bounties for retrieval.<br>
I also had been seeing a trend of a lot of EBO decks lately, which would<br>
rip up my deck, so I added in an ATAT cannon and TTMG.  I was expecting<br>
on playing against AT LEAST 2 EBO decks.  Unfortunately, I had no time <br>
to playtest them, so the decks were all theory and would be new for me,<br>
but oh well, I&#146;ll have to manage.<br>
<br>
So we all get to the venue, but Hardy&#146;s not there yet so we sit around<br>
for a while, and I see some big name players arrive. Paul Feldman, Eric<br>
&quot;Big E&quot; Bruen, Jeff Miller, Tray Frazier, Pete Nordstrom, Jason Makohon,<br>
&amp; the &quot;Lodi crew&quot; all arrive.  But as I said, a lot of Southern CA talent<br>
 was missing.  I was betting on Bruen, Dong, or Feldman to win the title.<br>
So we fill out decklists (those of us who hadn&#146;t already done so), pay <br>
the $10 entry fee, and get ready to play.  Over 60 people are playing <br>
(65 I think it was).<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS v Steve Daniel&#146;s Y4 Throne Room jank (Insurr, DODN/WA, ????)<br>
<br>
I&#146;m confused when I don&#146;t see Staging Areas as a starting effect.  So I<br>
have no idea what to expect, plus this is the first time playing my new<br>
deck, so its double trouble for me.  He pulls 1/0 DBs, but no twix sites<br>
yet.  I pull Exec DB, then Tat DB and put DLOTS there on my 2nd turn.<br>
He cancels Visage w/TT combo, then EPP Obi comes to battle DLOTS, they <br>
both die.  Then he plays OOC, but doesn&#146;t get Vader.  I drop another <br>
Vader and Jodo, then EPP Luke comes to battle, and kills Vader, but Jodo<br>
captures Luke.  Thats because I started All Wrapped Up (along with IAO &amp;<br>
Mob Pts).  He OOCs a couple more times, but still misses Vader.  Turns <br>
out he&#146;s playing 9 OOCs!  Yikes!  Steve deploys 8D8 to Y4 War room, my<br>
next turn I Twi&#146;lek for YCHF to prevent odds.  Then he deploys Artoo w/<br>
8D8 and plays HDWGITM to draw a new hand (he does it several times <br>
during the game).  He REALLY wants to get Vader OOP.  I deploy CHYBC to<br>
stop any retrieval he might have in his deck (turns out he uses Edge<br>
cards), and he deploys Battle Plan.<br>
<br>
Now I&#146;m paying 6 to drain for 2 at my CC and Tat Dbays (no BG systems in<br>
my deck, I use Mob Pts to pull Executor).  Search and Destroy comes out,<br>
he he inserts AFA 3 times on me, but only once it hits because 2 other<br>
times he had EPP Obi on table to battle.  Obi frees Luke by killing<br>
Jodo, but I put a Bounty on Luke&#146;s head and recap him.  By now Steve <br>
realizes he can&#146;t hurt me or retrieve force, so he hits me with a late<br>
game Surprise Assault for 2 force and eventually does get Vader OOP. <br>
In fact, he put 20 cards of mine OOP, I had no lost pile.  But I still<br>
win by 15.  2 (+15).  I find out he plays 3 EPP Obis and 3 EPP Lukes.<br>
So when I capped Luke that really hurt him.<br>
<br>
Best: Coward &amp; YCHF earned their card slots in that game.<br>
Worst: Paying 6 to drain for 2.  Yikes!<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS v John Monroe&#146;s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, SSPFT)<br>
<br>
We&#146;ve played this matchup several times before, and I&#146;ve never lost to<br>
John&#146;s ISB deck, but I didn&#146;t know how Mon Cals would fare.  I started<br>
ANSB and luckily drew Battle Plan in my opening hand.  So as I was <br>
setting up EBO he pulled Exec (w/Mob Pts), Exec DB, and Piett w/Command.<br>
He got Merrejk and eventually put them at Exec DB, while pulling all<br>
his systems out.  I draw into Staging Areas and Haven, great for me.<br>
He pays 3 to drain for 2 at Endor while I setup Haven on Hoth &amp; deploy<br>
Defiance w/Hassh&#146;n aboard.  I use EBG to pull my Rogue pilots and get<br>
Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge, establishing Menace<br>
Fades.  He avoids Hoth and sets up at Fondor, Kashyyyk, and Endor.  He<br>
uses Den of Thieves and an ORS to kill my Hoth drain &amp; I&#146;m looking<br>
for a Signal to pull Strikeforce (so he can&#146;t cancel my space drain).<br>
I drop 3 more cruisers to Hoth (-1 staging areas, -1 EBO, -2 Haven, so<br>
they deploy for 4 force!), and move a couple cruisers w/pilots to<br>
Endor.  His other drains are only 1 each thanks to Menace.  He just <br>
runs most of his fleet to Hoth, taking advantage of the fact that his<br>
other ships are safe since my cruisers only deploy to Hoth.<br>
<br>
I battle at Hoth, he loses a couple ORS (he has flipped by now), and<br>
I move from Endor to Hoth.  He never deploys to the ground to satisfy<br>
Battle Plan, but he does manage to block Menace Fades for a turn so he<br>
pays to drain me for 3 at Kashyyyk (Chirneau adding to the drain).<br>
I&#146;m ready to do some Edge retrieval, when the TD says we have 1 minute<br>
left.  Jeez, we&#146;ve each still got over 20 cards left, so I know we <br>
won&#146;t finish.  Time is called, and he&#146;s got 29 cards to my 24.  *sigh*<br>
Timed Loss by 29.  2 (-14).<br>
<br>
Best: The deck seemed to work well.<br>
Worst: John is a slow player, plus I think I was playing slower than <br>
normal since I was playing the deck for the 1st time. Fun game though.<br>
<br>
Game 3: DS v Norman Perion&#146;s EBO (ANSB)<br>
<br>
Ah-hah!  Didn&#146;t I say I&#146;d play vs. EBO?  Well, my opening hand stinks.<br>
No Vader, ATAT, Cannon, or TTMG.  But when I pull the Exec DB, I see<br>
I activated the Cannon and Blizzard 1.  So I draw those up.  Just <br>
need TTMG and a high ability pilot (like Vader or Mara).  He sets up<br>
EBO turn 3, with some Baragwins.  They&#146;re retrieving everything he&#146;s<br>
losing to Visage, so I Twi&#146;lek for CHYBC to stop that gay retrieval.<br>
By now I have Mighty Jabba at CC DB, Xizor at Tat DB, and Lando at<br>
Exec DB (after I deploy Lando, he loses General Lando to Visage, lol).<br>
So I leave them there and deploy Blizzard 1 with Vader and the Cannon.<br>
He gives me look of amazment like he doesn&#146;t believe what he sees.  <br>
He drops Sullust w/Haven and Gold 6 w/pilot there.  I&#146;m hoping I draw<br>
high enough to kill EBO so I don&#146;t have to eat that drain.  On my turn<br>
I play TTMG, and he just groans, I say I need to draw a 2, and I draw<br>
a 2, so the MPGs are gone, ANSB is gone, and most importantly, EBO is<br>
gone, along with 8 of his life force.  Too bad I didn&#146;t have Mara,<br>
cuz she could&#146;ve beat down a Baragwin badly.<br>
<br>
Later during that turn I deploy the Executor to Sullust and move Lando<br>
aboard.  I also deploy Search and Destroy.  So he&#146;s losing to S&amp;D,<br>
Visage, and my drains.  And he can&#146;t retrieve.  As the game goes on I<br>
transit my guys over to Hoth, to kill the Baragwins.  I battled at <br>
Sullust and drew a 6, so Gold 6 and pilot died, along with Haven.  So<br>
Lando ruled space in the Executor.  Win by 32.  4 (+18).<br>
<br>
Best: CHYBC and TTMG earned their card slots.  I would&#146;ve died<br>
horribly to this deck without those cards.  The Baragwins are<br>
retrieval machines!<br>
Worst: No Mara to infiltrate Hoth with.  I had to transit guys over.<br>
<br>
Game 4: LS v Steve Daniel&#146;s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, ????)<br>
<br>
I think he also started Crush, but I could be wrong.  Anyways, he<br>
gets Emp and Janus to Endor DB, DLOTS to CC DB.  I start ANSB and<br>
deploy destiny 6 Luke to DLOTS.  I get Battle Plan out early to make<br>
him pay to drain, but can&#146;t find Haven.  So I setup EBO and drop 2<br>
cruisers to Hoth.  Hobbie and Zev in Rogue 4 go to the North Ridge.<br>
His turn he beats the hell out of Zev and Hobbie.  Tempest 1, <br>
Blizzard 2, and Fett hit the Ridge, and I lose Zev and Hobbie and<br>
stack a card.  Hobbie goes to the Bacta Tank.  So I pay for my space<br>
drain, and decide to let him have the Ridge.  I move to Chandrila to<br>
activate more force, leaving Hoth empty.  He drops Chimarea w/Ozzel<br>
&amp; another pilot to Chandrila, I move back to Hoth, he follows.  Now<br>
I&#146;ve got Haven, so I drop 2 cruisers, Lando in Falcon, &amp; RL in R1 <br>
to beat the hell out of the Chimaera (power was 50 to 19), but he <br>
just Ghhhks.  I drew a 6 and 5 for battle destiny.  Then I split my<br>
fleet between Chandrila and Hoth.  He drops Zuckuss w/4LOM to<br>
Chandrila, but I barrier Zuckuss.  I deploy I&#146;ll Take the Leader to<br>
make him power 2, then battle to kill Zuckuss plus 6 overflow damage.<br>
I had Ackbar and Hassh&#146;n there, but I forgot to use Ackbar&#146;s text at<br>
the start of my turn to pull Thaneespi.  That could&#146;ve been a nice<br>
beating on Zuckuss (power 2 and NO destiny!).<br>
<br>
Now I own space, and he spreads on the ground so I deploy Wedge, RSL<br>
on Rogue 4 and shuttle Hobbie there to hold the Ridge.  He deploys<br>
another Chimaera w/a couple pilots later, but steers clear of my <br>
fleet so he can drain for free (he has Carida out).  But my drains<br>
are much bigger, and I eventually kill the Chimaera again (not in<br>
a beating though), and drain him out for the win.  Win by 8.  <br>
6 (+26).<br>
<br>
Best: Deck seemed to work well yet again.  Only 1 card got stacked.<br>
Worst: I deployed a LOT in this game.  Plus Vader and Emp were<br>
draining me all game.  Where were my EPPs?<br>
<br>
Game 5: LS v Tray Frazier&#146;s TDIGWATT (IAO, Mob Pts, Crush)<br>
<br>
I start ANSB and as I was doing that, he got Emp, Janus, and Mara<br>
w/saber all at the CC Db with a POTF there.  Drain of 4!  Ouch.<br>
Times like this I wish I was playing EBOX so I just use an xwing to<br>
cancel it.  Oh well, I eat that drain and get Haven on Hoth and put<br>
GL in G1 and a cruiser there along with Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 1<br>
at the Ridge.  Menace Fades is out, so he&#146;s draining me for 2 now.<br>
HE comes at me with Dengar w/gun and Lord Vader to the Ridge, I<br>
barrier Vader.  On my turn, I Ice Storm and he&#146;s really pissed when<br>
I do that.  So Menace Fades is back, and I&#146;m draining for 4 at Hoth <br>
now since Launching the Assault is out.  He drops Chimaera w/Guri<br>
and Thrawn and battles, sending Ackbar to the Tank.  He has his<br>
Order out whoch makes his ships immune to attirion&lt;8, so I need to<br>
get a new Order out.  I deploy Lando in Falcon and Home One to Hoth<br>
and kill Guri and Thrawn, he runs to Chandrila and puts 2 more <br>
pilots on it.  I move Home One over with Luke and Wedge, RSL aboard.<br>
He stays there, so on my turn I deploy Liberty and EPP Han there &amp;<br>
smash the Chimaera (drawing 2 high destiny and cancelling his draw)<br>
and now I own space.  The big space drains shortly end the game.<br>
He only deployed Bespin, CC DB, CC West Corridor, &amp; a 1/0 Dbay.<br>
Win by 10.  8 (+36).<br>
<br>
Best: I&#146;m liking this light deck.<br>
Worst: The deck for some reason just can&#146;t win by very high <br>
differential.  I&#146;m 4-1 but with really low diff, even compared to<br>
the people who are 3-2.<br>
<br>
Game 6: DS v John Monroe&#146;s HB mains (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br>
<br>
I&#146;m thinking its an auto-win here.  John has played this deck since <br>
the dawn of time, and it seems he always will play it.  I figure<br>
I&#146;ll capture his guys, and retrieve w/Bounties.  It started off <br>
well when he put Ben Kenobi w/stick to Tat DB.  I put a Bounty on<br>
him and deployed Bossk w/gun and Dr. E/Ponda and battled.  DLOTS <br>
was at the CC DB.  I capped Ben w/Bossk, so he took him over to<br>
DLOTS.  He&#146;s activating 10 force, and drops Jedi Luke w/saber,<br>
battles, steals Vader&#146;s stick, hits Bossk (barely), plays SATM/BP<br>
to make him lost, then hits Vader w/Ben.  I draw a 5, so Ben <br>
revives Luke.  But now Ben and Luke are at my CC DB, and I couldn&#146;t<br>
believe how badly that went.  Anyway, EPP Vader went to Tat DB,<br>
I deployed CC Prison, deployed Lando aboard Tempest 1, and moved to<br>
Vader&#146;s site.  Then I deployed Sim and Emperor to Vader&#146;s site.<br>
He put Wedge, RSL and Mirax with Ben and Luke.  I moved everyone<br>
(except the Emperor) to Ben and Luke&#146;s site, adn he moved away. <br>
<br>
That continued until we heard &quot;5 minutes left.&quot;  Like I said, John<br>
is a rather slow player, but its partly my fault cuz I was talking<br>
to him about stuff, which just slows everything down even more.  I<br>
was mad at myself (I didn&#146;t want a timed win), so when I moved my<br>
guys over to his guys, I used Sim to check his destiny, and he had<br>
a zero on top.  I knew I had a 5 and 4 on top, so I decided to duel,<br>
but who would I duel first?  Both had sabers, so I picked Luke (he<br>
is harder to duel).  I had more life force than John, so I could&#146;ve<br>
let things progress, but I didn&#146;t want a timed win.  He draws a 0<br>
and 3, but plays Glancing Blow, so he wins the duel.  I&#146;m in shock,<br>
(like Norman was when I played TTMG), and I lose my 9 force.  Oh<br>
well, I had to risk it.  A timed win would&#146;ve been just as good as<br>
a loss for me.  When time is called, he has 27 to my 19.  Timed<br>
loss by 27.  8 (+9).<br>
<br>
Best: None really, I needed to battle him so I could duel and use<br>
Tarkin to cancel on of his destiny.  But he wouldn&#146;t stick around<br>
to battle.  I thought about picking up Vader, but I never had <br>
enough guys to back up Vader with.<br>
Worst: Really boring game, it really was just those 2 battles at<br>
the start of the game, then just avoidance.  I guess that&#146;s why I<br>
started talking to him, cuz I was bored.<br>
<br>
John decides to drop at this point since he&#146;s got 3 timed wins and<br>
one loss.<br>
<br>
Game 7: DS v Pete Nordstrom&#146;s Profit (Insurr, Staging, Wise Advice)<br>
<br>
I start Mara and EPP Fett.  I deploy Exec DB, JP Dungeon, Tat DB, <br>
&amp; DLOTS to the Tat DB all 1st turn.  He draws.  When Vader drains,<br>
he plays Lost in Wilderness, but draws a 1, so Vader&#146;s safe.  He<br>
deploys his CC DB, and deploys BoShuda.  I deploy my CC DB, I <br>
deploy Lando and Tempest 1 there, so Lando w/Ax is not a worry <br>
anymore.  I also deploy Mara&#146;s saber and CHYBC.  I move Fett &amp;<br>
Mara outside to JP.  He deploys EPP Obi to Vader and they kill<br>
each other.  I deploy EPP Vader and Tarkin, then deploy Search &amp;<br>
Destroy.  I know he wants to free Han but doesn&#146;t know how he&#146;s<br>
going to occupy 2 BG sites.  I keep deploying every turn, and I&#146;ve<br>
got Emp at Tat DB, Jabba, Fett, Mara, and 4LOM at JP, Vader and<br>
Tarkin at my CC DB, and Dr. E/Ponda and Lando in Tempest 1 at his<br>
CC DB.  Where would you deploy?  He puts Ben at Tat DB, and <br>
battles the Emp.  I draw low so I lose 2 force.<br>
<br>
I move Vader and Tarkin over, but he runs to CC DB (which is now<br>
empty since Vader and Tarkin moved to Tat DB).  Vader &amp; Tarkin<br>
follow Ben, so he deploys Orrimaarko to battle the Emp with a <br>
tracked 6, I draw low so I lose Emp and 2 force to Orri&#146;s text.<br>
Ben moves over to Orri&#146;s site.  I move Vader and Tarkin over.<br>
He deploys Mirax in the Chamber and I realize he&#146;s going to transit<br>
Ben to CC DB to occupy 2 BG sites, then free Han, so I blindly<br>
duel Ben, drawing two 5&#146;s to his two 1&#146;s, and he just scoops up<br>
his deck right then and there, so I win by 23.  10 (+32).<br>
<br>
Best: Don&#146;t try those blind duels at home, they&#146;re dangerous.  :P<br>
Worst: Both Pete and I had planned on doing better than we were<br>
doing, so I can understand him being a little pissed.<br>
<br>
Game 8: LS v Jeff Miller&#146;s Endor Ops TIEs (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br>
<br>
He pulls Wakeelmui and every 1/0 Dbay there is.  I start ANSB.<br>
He draws for a while, I deploy Battle Plan and get EBO by turn 2.<br>
I put Liberty and Zev at Hoth, he drops 2 Interceptors and 2 <br>
Dreadnoughts (I barrier 1 of them), battles and of course plays<br>
APTW.  I lose Zev to the Tank and Liberty to the used pile since<br>
he outpowered me by a good amount.  Oh yeah, he had SFS out too.<br>
So I deploy GL in G1 w/Zen aboard and move them over to Wakeelmui.<br>
Hobbie and Wedge are in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge.  He deploys<br>
Janus to Endor DB to satisfy Battle Plan, and deploys 2 more<br>
Interceptors and a Dread to his Sullust.  I&#146;ve got Haven in hand<br>
so I can go to either system, but I fear his text on Sullust (I<br>
lose 8 force if he cancels Haven).  I decide to hold off on Haven<br>
and put RL in R1 at Chandrila.  That also satisfies Menace Fades<br>
for me so he&#146;s not draining for as much.  He drops an interceptor<br>
w/cannons and blows up Red Leader.  Now I drop destiny 6 Luke to<br>
Janus, he barriers, then runs Janus to the Bunker.<br>
<br>
I decide to deploy a Cruiser to Hoth, then put down Haven and<br>
deploy Lando in Falcon &amp; another cruiser.  He deploys an <br>
interceptor to Wakeelmui and deploys Emp&#146;s Sword to Hoth, battles,<br>
and plays APTW so I lose a cruiser, and since I draw low on both<br>
draws he just loses a TIE.  He moves his fleet to Wakeelmui (he<br>
had been moving it from Sullust to get it closer to Wakeelmui)<br>
so Gold Leader and Zev run away.  Then we hear &quot;only 2 minutes <br>
left,&quot; and I&#146;m wondering where the time is going.  Jeff is playing<br>
slowly, but I didn&#146;t think an HOUR had passed already.  Anyway,<br>
I do 2 On The edges but he still has 24 force to my 20 force when<br>
time is called.  I honestly don&#146;t know where the time went.  Does<br>
it sound like all that happened in an hour?  Well, it did.  Timed<br>
loss by 24.  10 (+8).<br>
<br>
Best: I owned all the BG sites.<br>
Worst: He owned most of the BG systems.  TIEs are just too fast<br>
for my deck I think.  An why is my LS timing out?  I&#146;m not a slow <br>
player at all.<br>
<br>
So I finish 17th place with a score of 10 (+8).  What terrible<br>
differential, huh?  Here are the top 6:<br>
<br>
Alfred Dong 14 (+111)<br>
Paul Feldman 14 (+100)<br>
Paul McKelvey 12 (+120)<br>
Jason Makohon 12 (+104)<br>
Alexander Sheynis<br>
Kyle Ishimaru<br>
<br>
Alfred and Paul played in the final, with Paul winning both games,<br>
thus earning the title of State Champion.  Alfred used his Hunt <br>
Down v Paul&#146;s WYS, with Paul winning by 2 or 3 force, then Alfred<br>
played his Y4 Throne Room deck v Paul&#146;s SYCFA manipulator deck, <br>
where Paul won again (they didn&#146;t count the diff).  Congrats to<br>
Paul, and thanks to all of you for reading.  Back to studying for<br>
finals.<br>
<br>
Props to:<br>
Alfred for getting to that final.<br>
Paul for winning the final.<br>
Paul Mckelvey for doing waaaay better than I thought he would.<br>
Kyle for doing waaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought he would.<br>
Phil Green for doing waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought.<br>
Steve Daniel for actually winning with that light deck.<br>
Nick for the ride.<br>
Mike Hardy for running the tourney.<br>
<br>
Slops to:<br>
Nick&#146;s station wagon, that wagon sucks.<br>
Alfred for losing to Paul&#146;s WYS deck.  Somehow he let Paul back in<br>
that game cuz it looked like Alfred had it locked.<br>
Mike Hardy for being late. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=2281"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=2281"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
