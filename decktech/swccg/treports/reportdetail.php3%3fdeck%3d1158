except for holidays) for a mere $1, and each tournament typically draws 12 to 20 players.<br>
Owing to the frequency and low expense of the tournaments, they’ve become great<br>
opportunities to play new, strange and fun deck ideas while, simultaneously (owing to the<br>
presence of such players as Jim Li, Michael Ravelling and Graham Neal), providing<br>
chances to meet some stiff competition.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to the rest of the report:<br>
<br>
The Star Wars tournament at GenCon was a dismal experience for me due to the number<br>
of rounds (I knew I’d leave early as soon as they announced it was 8 games), conflict<br>
with other events, sloppy play on my part during one game and a miserable encounter<br>
with some fellow who was blatantly cheating. I don’t mind losing, but I really don’t like<br>
playing against someone who’s a bad sport or arrogant or just plain obnoxious. This<br>
fellow was a terrible sport.<br>
<br>
But I did learn a bit about the meta game, post D*2. I hadn’t brought a very good DS<br>
deck with me to the tournament, then, and I wanted to integrate the new cards more fully<br>
into my deck. Docking Bays &amp; Mob Points seemed all the rage with the BHBM<br>
objective, but I didn’t have an Emperor. It idea occurred to me, though, to use the 0 side<br>
of the Court objective to search for docking bays (instead of IAO, saving me one effect<br>
slot), grab Hoth’s and Yavin’s, and I could play Imperial Decree (because I love that<br>
card).<br>
<br>
So, I threw that deck together without planning to flip it, but I realized a Profit deck<br>
could spoil it as it was. I threw in a couple of Trap Doors, the Rancor and its Pit and<br>
tested the deck against my LS Training deck. It won 2 out of 3 with Search and Destroy<br>
cutting out a good chunk. And it was only a Tuesday night tourney, so that was good<br>
enough for me. It would be, at any rate, a fun deck to play, and that’s what I was really<br>
looking forward to--fun--especially after my sour tourney at GenCon.<br>
<br>
LS: MWYHL, Training Luke through Test 6.<br>
DS: COTVG, pull everything from the reserve deck.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My LS vs Chad’s (don’t know his last name) BHBM.<br>
<br>
Chad’s a good guy and seems to play more for moral victories than tourney points. He<br>
once played a super-weird trooper deck against me using that interrupt that prevents all<br>
movement if he draws a destiny lower than the number of troopers on the table. It almost<br>
worked, too. Anyway, I expected something of that style when it turned out he was<br>
playing pretty much a straight BHBM mains &amp; toys deck. Though I have to credit him<br>
with the idea of using the D*2 anti-ops effect (you know: occupy their system, kill their<br>
deck...) to ditch it to retrieve the top card of his lost pile. (It ended up retrieving the<br>
Executor for him--which never came into play.) I just waited for Vader to show up and<br>
deployed HOTJ which, with Battle Plan, slowed my force loss to a manageable amount<br>
while I sped through my tests to flip. I eventually flipped but got only a 4 since I had<br>
mis-tracked my 7’s, and I still had a couple of force left in my lost pile. He was sitting on<br>
Endor with Vader and Mara holding two sites. I left Vader alone and pulled Farmboy<br>
Luke back from Dagobah to set down Jedi Luke and Obi w/Saber vs Mara. He removed<br>
Luke from battle with You Are Beaten, but Obi hit Mara for enough of a loss that the<br>
game was decided. I controlled his Endor system with a multiple-destiny drawing ship<br>
and he had to pay to drain for 1 each turn with Vader.<br>
<br>
FW 2 (+14)<br>
<br>
Game 2: My DS vs. Jerome Flynn’s Profit.<br>
<br>
Well, you can probably tell that this game was decided by a couple of battles. He hit<br>
Mara hard with Jedi Luke, early on, for some damage from my life force, but then he<br>
Nabrunned Luke w/Saber and Proficiency over to face Vader. Vader then showed why<br>
he’s still the baddest dude in the galaxy when he Levitated away Luke’s 4-power stick<br>
and then proceeded to target and hit and beat up Luke (with the aid of Blizzard 2) for<br>
something like 13 extra force from the reserve deck. Of course, I had started Secret<br>
Plans, so this was a bit of a problem for Jerome’s deck, and, in the end, he never flipped.<br>
I continued my piddly drains and pulled off a win by 22. Or something like that. All the<br>
differentials in this report are estimates.<br>
<br>
FW 4(+36)<br>
<br>
Game 3: My DS vs Michael Ravelling’s scrub beat-down<br>
<br>
Michael had some EPP’s in there, too, but he lost a lot of them to early damage (Mara,<br>
Fett w/Blaster and Dr. E vs Leia w/Blaster--hit, lost; Chewbacca--hit, lost; and<br>
Orrimarko). So he was left to play most of the game with characters like Melas and 2/2<br>
pilots. However, he must have been playing 4 or 5 Out of Commissions because they just<br>
kept hitting me, and I couldn’t for the life of me draw one of my two Hell to Pays. Jabba<br>
quit for good, then Fett, and... just when he showed up in my hand (typical)... Vader.<br>
Uggh. That was killer. So I was left to face his seemingly endless hordes of weenies with<br>
the likes of Tarkin, Igar (and where’s his walker?), Dr. E in Blizzard 2 and ECC IG-88.<br>
But Iggy proved to have what it took when Michael plopped down Han w/Blaster, Wedge<br>
and Momaw to drain at my &lt;&gt; DB on Tatooine where my Iggy was sitting all by his<br>
lonesome on the other side. My next turn, Iggy Snipered Han (capture) used the text on<br>
COTVG to search for a DB and saw this his weapon destiny were all quite high, initiated<br>
a battle, fired to send Wedge scurrying back to the used pile and beat up on Momaw. I<br>
moved Iggy over, flipped my objective and started drawing for a Trap Door. Eventually, I<br>
drew one along with my Rendili (I had opted to search for the Executor earlier since<br>
Michael started Rendez-vous Point w/Insurrection, Strike Planning and Squassi). I<br>
plopped down the Rancor Pit, Rancor and Rendili w/Zuckuss (he didn’t really have<br>
enough force to beat me up there). I dropped Han to the Rancor and expected a quick<br>
feeding, but Michael played Fallen Portal--and missed. Han had only stunned the Rancor,<br>
who then gnawed on the famed smugglers bones, dropping Michael to something like 5<br>
or 6 life force, which quickly disappeared.<br>
<br>
FW 6 (+62)<br>
<br>
I had won that last game by 26 or so, my biggest of the evening, but when the pairings<br>
were called out I was on the same side as the player with the highest differential. Oh,<br>
well. My LS deck was fairly solid, but I didn’t expect that I could win by much.<br>
<br>
Game 4 (last game): My LS vs Garrett’s (great guy, don’t remember his last name) Ties<br>
<br>
He sacrificed his drains for the first few turns, allowing me to go straight through my<br>
tests. He didn’t drain until he got out Kiffex and a sizable fleet there. I ended up flipping<br>
with Artoo in Red 5 as my tracked 7 and paid 10 to retrieve 6 or so. My next turn, I asked<br>
him what his power was at the system, what it would be after he played All Power to<br>
Weapons (and I had a grabber waiting for that one), and checked to see how much force<br>
he had saved (a lot). I had Home 1 and EPP madness--Han, Leia and Chewie--but only<br>
enough force for Han, Chewie and Life Debt. Yet, considering my destiny of 28, I would<br>
still be up by enough power at the start of the battle that I didn’t figure I would lose by<br>
too much. So I battled and he reacted and played All Power, which I grabbed, and I lost<br>
Han and Chewie and one or two more from my deck. But he had all his ties there with no<br>
capital ship and, thus, no hyperspeed, so I moved Home 1 over to Wakeelmui. The next<br>
turn, Home 1 cleared out Wakeelmui with another Han and Leia, I think, and I Altered<br>
his SFS. With Aim High in play, things were looking good. I had a good armada of ships<br>
in my deck, including the Gold Squadron 1 combo, and we just kept battling according to<br>
my calculated terms. Garrett managed to pull off a moral victory when he blew away the<br>
Lando’s Falcon with a Tie Laser; he needed a 5 and got it. Ultimately, however, 2<br>
damage each turn from Test 6, Battle Plan and my space armada--which deployed at<br>
systems other than his space armada’s--secured the victory for me by 13. Or thereabouts.<br>
<br>
So I managed to go undefeated through the tournament with a differential of something<br>
like 75, which wasn’t very high, at least not for our player base. But Herb Macy, who was<br>
sitting at the top table, must have had a squeaker, because I ended up getting first ahead<br>
of TWO other undefeated players. Another kid, Jon, had gone undefeated, too. But I<br>
knew he had won one game by a mere 4 since a crowd had gathered (with permission, of<br>
course) to watch his game when it was the last game running (2nd game in the<br>
tournament, I think).<br>
<br>
At $1 a tournament, any prize support is really nice, especially when you pull the Spiral<br>
in your one pack of Special Edition.<br>

PS   After the tournament, I played a game with one of my friends, Justin Alfs, whose<br>
EBO deck with Rogue speeders ended up killing me by 6 or 7 force, causing me to<br>
rethink DS space--five bounty hunter ships and the Executor just aren’t enough... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=1158"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=1158"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
