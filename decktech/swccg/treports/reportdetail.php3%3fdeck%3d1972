<br>
Spring Break time and I was heading out to Colorado to go skiing at Winter Park.  Colorado!? Isn&amp;#8217;t Parker in Colorado? Doesn&amp;#8217;t Brian Hunter play in Parker?  Is there a tournament in Parker when I&amp;#8217;m out there?  Thankfully there was.  I get out of school on Friday and go home and pack my cards.  I was set on my SYCFA interceptors for Dark.  Its got a record of 24-2 in tournaments, I added another grabber and Secret Plans to fight Hidden Mains.  I don&amp;#8217;t use it at locals anymore because people are packing Scrambled Transmission and 2 Shocking Info/Grimtaashes because they&amp;#8217;re so scared of it.  We drive off to North Platt, Nebraska, stopping for dinner in York.  I hate Nebraska.  It is flatter and more boring than any other place I&amp;#8217;ve even been (and I&amp;#8217;m from Iowa.)  But I figured out the solution on this trip.  Just sleep through it.  It&amp;#8217;s amazing how much quicker the miles fly by when you&amp;#8217;re sleeping.  We finally get to our hotel and I build my light deck.  I was worried about HDown dueling for dark so I tried to think of what would do well against that.  I remembered Dalantyr&amp;#8217;s Rescue deck and built that as close as I could from memory.  I was short 3 key cards, so I made a mental not to trade for those.  Then I went off to sleep.  I wake up next morning and pile in the van.  Eastern Colorado is almost as boring as Nebraska, so I slept through that too.  I get to Collectormania at about 1030.  People keep trickling in and I trade for the stuff I need.  We get started about on time.  There were about 25 people when we started.<br>
<br>
Game 1, LS vs Alex Stine (1667) with Hunt Down Dueling<br>
I start my 4 sites, Prisoner 2187 and Heading For The Medical Frigate for Battle Plan, Staging Areas and the Do or Do Not combo.  This start didn&amp;#8217;t change all day.  He starts the standard HDown stuff with Mob. Points, IAO and Secret Plans.  He pulls Caridia, the Executor DB and draws a few.  We both loose to Visage.  I activate and deploy a lift tube to the D*DB.  I draw for 8d8 or Echo Base Garrison and I get both.  Loose to Visage again.  Down come Vader and Janus to the Yavin IV DB, flipping his objective.  I Trans Terminated from hand and he deploys another Visage from hand.  I kill it with another TT/OOC.  He converts my D*DB, moves Vader and Janus to my War Room and draws a few.  I toss down 8D8 and EBG.  I search with EBG and BOTH MY 8D8s AND BACTA TANK ARE IN MY FORCE PILE!  So he gets a verification, which sucks.  I deploy Rendezvous Point from hand, transit 8D8 to the D* and move him to the prison in the Lift Tube.  He pays 3 to drain and I loose 2.  I loose from the 2 8D8s that I drew.  He deploys Bad Feeling Have I, so all my guys are expensive.  Then he deploys Zuckuss and something else (Bossk?) to Caridia.  I don&amp;#8217;t want to tangle with that.  They would drain me for 1 all game.  He draws.  I activate and spring the Prisoner, retrieving 4 with my prison text.  I pay 3 to drain for 4, but he reminds me that I can&amp;#8217;t because of the flipped Huntdown.  I move Leia and 8D8 over in the tube to the DB and transit Leia to Yavin 4.  He comes down with Tarkin and some other fool and battles Leia. I have no fallen portal, so he&amp;#8217;s safe from that.  I play Warriors Courage and draw a 4 and 6, so both his guys die.  Leia was hit, so I have to loose her and 8D8.  I activate and deploy Leia with Gun against Janus and Vader, which flips my objective.  I battle and shoot Janus.  I draw high and he draws low.  Vader and Janus are placed out of play, flipping his objective and I loose Leia, flipping mine.  He pays 3 to drain for 1 and draws for characters.  I start drawing like crazy looking for characters and my 3rd Leia.  About a turn after the fateful battle he realizes that I couldn&amp;#8217;t have battle because of the flipped Huntdown, but we both forgot.  The rest of the game is extremely boring.  I get Bacta Tank out and find my 3rd Leia.  I place about 7 guys OOP with my flipped objective.  He gets out another Visage and we both loose a lot to that, but I eventually get another TT/OOC.  I pull off a D*Plans for 11 with Artoo.  I wind up with an EPP Obi squared off against Tarkin and Dr. E.  I battle and he plays Put All Sections On Alert, so Obi dies.  I kill them next turn with Luke.  I drain him for about 4 a turn on the ground and he drains for 1 in space.  It is over quickly.<br>

Lowlights: Shouldn&amp;#8217;t have won<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. Rob Farallo (1432) with Incom Corp (X-Wings and Speeders)<br>
He starts with Liberation and I almost crap myself.  Then he reveals Tatooine and the &lt;&gt;Farm, so I feel much better.  He starts HFTMF for Staging Areas, Menace Fades and the DODN/TINT combo.  I grab Wakewhatever with Mob. Points and activate 7.  I go for the early hurt and throw down Kashyyyk from hand and an interceptor to Kashyyyk and Tatooine.  I draw my last 3 and get a Twilek.  He activates and announces he&amp;#8217;s searching for a docking bay.  I look at his effects and ask him what he&amp;#8217;s searching with.  He says insurrection and I tell him it&amp;#8217;s not out.  He stares at his effects for about a minuet and says, &amp;#8220;@#$%!!!, HOW THE HELL DID I START WITH MENACE FADES!!!&amp;#8221;  Apparently he was supposed to start with Insurrection, not Menace Fades.  He decides he can&amp;#8217;t win the game without  his Hoth DB and Incom Corp, so he gives up.  I activate 3 and play a Twilek for SFS.  Finish activating and drain for 4.  I draw up and get 3 APTW.  He activates and draws a few.  I play an APTW lost and get 3 interceptors.  I reinforce my drains at Tatooine and Kashyyyk.  He activates and plays an Organized Attack lost to get 3 X-Wings.  He deploys 5 X-Wings on my 2 interceptors at Tatooine.  I play All Power and he plays Organized Attack.  He draws his Hoth DB for battle destiny, so the power is 20-12.  I lose one interceptor to the used pile, one to lost and 2 more.  On my turn, I activate, drain and draw into another APTW, and a SFS 9.3 cannon.  He just activates and drains for 1.  I grab a interceptor with Short Range, grab another 3 with an APTW lost.  I activate and drain for 2.  Deploy 4 interceptors, one with a laser cannon and my Fighter Cover.  Battle, play APTW and shoot down 2 of his X-Wings with my laser cannon.  He looses 2 X-Wings and a bunch force.  Leaving one X-Wing in front of my fleet.  He activates and battles me.  I don&amp;#8217;t have an APTW, so my interceptors are just power 4 each, 1 is +3 from my AO and I draw a 2.  He looses all but 3 cards which I drain him for on my next turn.<br>

Game 3, LS vs Matt Miller (1721) with MKOS Abyssin swarm.<br>
<br>
This game was terrible.  I start my usual stuff and the starts Scum stuff with secret plans as his third effect.  He gets his guys into the AC early and gets the sail barge out.  On my 2nd turn, I spring Leia with 8D8 and get her to the Y4DB.  I draw up for a Fallen Portal, but don&amp;#8217;t get one.  I hope the thinks I have one and I&amp;#8217;m trying to mind game him.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t work and he comes down with 5 abyssins and beans on Leia for about 15.  I run several suicide runs, but none are really successful.  Highlight of the game for me was a suicide Twass going after Chall and a Merc Pilot on the sail barge.  I predicted myself the looser and drew a 6 killing them both.  I still lost the battle, so I got to retrieve one.  He drained me shortly after that.<br>

<br>
Game 4, DS vs. Van Melancon (1884) with Hidden Mains<br>
I&amp;#8217;m very happy, because I know my interceptors can shut down Hidden Mains.  He starts Insurrection, Staging Areas and one other effect (Squassin or Menace Fades)  I get a SFS out first turn and an interceptor at the system.  He gets Obi Wan Kenobi to the Tat DB fairly quickly with Obi&amp;#8217;s saber.  I drain and deploy Palpy to my D*DB for the activation, then draw.  He drains and I loose from hand.  He deploys Obi&amp;#8217;s Journal, Lando with Axe and the CC DB.  I drain and get guys at another system, reinforcing both.  As soon as he has a tracked 6, he plays On The Edge, getting 5 back, but I grab it.  He also pays 5 for secret plans.  He gets a Super Falcon with Mirax and another passenger to my D*, but I&amp;#8217;m not worried about it&amp;#8230; yet.  He alters my SFS, loosing the alter and 2 cause of TINT/OA.  I thank him.  I recirc at the end of his turn and play Twilek with 3 force saved from last turn.  I activate, drain and deploy CHYBC, killing his D* drain and retrieval until he gets another battleground.  I have 2 Interceptors and a SFS 9.3 Laser Cannon in my hand, so I decide to attack the Falcon.  I check my destinies and out of 10, only 3 will miss.  I battle and shoot with my laser cannon.  I draw a 2 and miss.  He plays Punch It! but I&amp;#8217;m still not worried.  I take my second shot and MISS AGAIN!  Arrrrrrgggggggg!!!!  I play All Power to lessen the hurt, but it&amp;#8217;s still a blow.  His destines weren&amp;#8217;t too good so I only loose about 6 or 7 from my life force.  He still can&amp;#8217;t drain me though, so I just take 2 more from Obi, who was persona switched to Ben.  Orri is deployed to the CC DB, getting the 2nd battleground for CHYBC.  He plays an Off The Edge on Orri and draws a 6, retrieving 5 and paying for secret plans.  The Falcon moves Wakewhatever.  I come down on it again, and this time get it with the first shot.  I get off a Short Range Fighters for 8.  Van decides he can&amp;#8217;t do enough damage and moves Ben to my D*DB, hoping to kill Palpy and get the extra drain.  I activate, drain and check my destines with SYCFA.  I see a 4 and three 5s.  I deploy First Strike and come down with Vader with Saber on Orri.  I battle, get one with First Strike, he looses one.  Swing and hit with a 5 and 4.  I draw a 5 to his 2 so he looses Orri and 5.  Vader dies to attrition.  Battle with Palpy and an Interceptor at the D*DB, I get one, he looses one.  He hits Palpy, I draw a 5, which cracks Ben&amp;#8217;s immunity, and the site is cleared.  On his turn he drains with Lando and plays On The Edge, guessing 5.  It&amp;#8217;s a 6, but his retrieval is canceled because of CHYBC.  I drain him out a couple turns after that.<br>
<br>

Highlights:  Killing Orri and Ben in a turn that ended Van&amp;#8217;s chance of winning<br>
Lowlights:  Missing both shots on the Falcon<br>
<br>
Van drops cause that was his 2nd loss.  He takes some of the Littleton crew with him, cause he is their ride<br>
<br>
Game 5 DS vs. Chris Fanchi (1740) with Hidden Mains with OMDH<br>
Before the game, Brian Hunter tells me to beat Fanchi so he doesn&amp;#8217;t have to play him next game.  I tell him I&amp;#8217;ll do my best.  Chris starts with Insurrection, Squassin and Staging Areas.  I throw an interceptor at my DB for activation with Mob. Points.  He gets the Tatooine system with HB and the Tatooine DB with Insurrection.  I get SFS second turn and go to Tatooine for the drain.  He gets Ben K to his DB.  I back up my drain with some Interceptors.  He can&amp;#8217;t do much damage, so he deploys RSL Wedge to RS1 with Squassin and moves them to Wakewhatever.  I come down with an interceptor with laser cannon and for the second time ever I miss both shots.  He draws low, so the damage is minimal.  He comes down with Cap. Han and Melas in the Falcon and parks at Tatooine.  I play an All Power lost during his draw phase and get 3 interceptors.  Short Range grabs another one.  They join the 3 already there, but one is barriered.  I battle the Falcon and he plays Punch It!  I play All Power.  His draws are 6,6,1,6 and mine is a 4.  I have power about equal to his.  He thinks all my interceptors are dead from attrition, but they live cause of All Power.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t battle with the Falcon on his turn, but transits Dash and Obi to my D*DB where Palp and an interceptor are chillin.  He tries to move the Falcon to Wakewhatever, but I play Gravity Shadow and it stays.  RS1 with RSL Wedge moves to Tatooine to protect the Falcon.  I deploy another interceptor or two, a Laser Cannon and Lat. Damage the Falcon.  I shoot down Wedge.  I have no All Power, so the game ending battle is averted.  His draw is a 4, mine a 3 so he looses the battle 27-4.  Han covers 7, Melas covers a little more and he loose a bunch.  He finally manages to hit Palpy with Obi&amp;#8217;s saber after several battles there so he gets control of my DB.  I play a short range for about 9 and come down with Vader with Saber on his Twass at the Tatooine DB.  An interceptor is deployed to the D*DB and battles there.  I get one with first strike, he looses one.  I miss my swing and draw a 2 for battle destiny.  He draws a 5, so our powers are both 8, but I remember my bonus from the system, so I have power 16-8.  He looses Twass and 4.  I drain him out shortly after that.<br>
<br>

Highlights: Beating the Falcon, remembering my power bonus form the system.<br>
Lowlights: Missing Wedge twice<br>
<br>
Joe Helfrich is depressed because he thinks he will have to play Brian Hunter, but it turns out I play Joe and Matt Miller and Brian Hunter switch decks.  Hunter is 5-0, Matt is 4-1 with a loss to Brian last game, I am 4-1 with a loss to Matt and Joe is 4-1, not sure who his loss was to.  I tell Matt to beat Brian Hunter, by a lot, so I can beat Joe by a lot and sneak into first.  This plan backfired.<br>
<br>
Game 6 LS vs. Joe Helfrich (1816) with Endor Ops<br>
He started with the DB effects and TINT/OA.  First turn, he pulls the Executor DB with IAO and Admiral Piett with Imperial Command.  What&amp;#8217;s next?  That&amp;#8217;s right, he uses Piett to pull Merrejk and Merrejk to pull Fondor.  Mobilization Points is used to pull the Executor.  I get 8D8 to the Prison on my first turn.  I play a TT/OOC and it gets grabbed.  On his turn, he starts piling guys at my war room and the yavin docking bay.  I have characters in my hand this time, so I can deal with them.  I spring Leia and drain for 4.  Deploy a load of guys including, but not limited to Chewbacca Protector (for 2!) Twass Kaah and Luke with Saber.  They all go to my the Y4 docking bay.  He loads some more guys up, so he has Gen Veers, Blizzard 2 and Admiral Ozzle at the Y4 docking bay and DS-61-2, DS-61-3 and some other fool at my war room.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t battle and its my turn.  I deploy one more guy to the Yavin DB and battle.  He plays imperial command to add a destiny.  Since both his guys are in the walker, I cant swing.  I we both draw low, but I over power him by quite a bit.  His forfeit covers the battle damage and his side is cleared.  I move Leia and some another character over, flipping my objective.  My forces are about equal at both sites, so his guys at my war room are trapped.  He goes for a change in pace, and decides he can&amp;#8217;t compete on the ground.  He gets Sullust with Merrejk and throws down the Executor at Fondor, then moves it to Sullust.  Piett and Merrejk move from the DB to the ship.  I deploy Echo Base Garrison on my turn and use it to get Bacta Tank, which I deploy.  I battle his guys at the war room and kill them all with no overflow.  He puts them in his lost pile.  I tell them they&amp;#8217;re out of play and he says it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter cause he doesn&amp;#8217;t have doubles or any of getting them back.  This was key.  I knew I was playing with more that 60 cards cause of D*Plans, so I could afford to be a bit more cautious than him.  I loose Twass to the Tank for my attrition.  He drained me at Sullust and deployed Lordy Vader with Darth Vader&amp;#8217;s Saber at the Endor Landing Platform and Ominous Rumors to Endor.  On my turn I drain for what I can and pull Twass out of the Tank.  I deploy Obi with Saber to the Landing Platform and battle Vader we both miss our swings so power is about equal.  He looses Vader to his growing out of play pile and says that&amp;#8217;s the only character he has doubles of.  Obi goes to the Bacta Tank.  He deploys a DSSD with Thrawn aboard to Sullust and moves the Executor to Endor.  He draws and plays a SHUOSHD to cancel my Bacta Tank.  We trade drains for a turn and I start to spread out to maximize my drains.  I deploy a D*Plans targeting 8D8 and get him to the Prison where he steals the plans.  On his turn, he comes down with a small force to the D* docking bay and kills my guy there.  He gets the SHUOSHD again and cancels my D*Plans.  I drain and kill his guys at my D* DB with Obi with Saber to feed his OOP pile.  I move 8D8 back for if I draw the 2nd D* Plans.  He pays 6 to drain for 4 in space.  I loose from hand.  He plays Imperial Command to grab Chiraneau, but doesn&amp;#8217;t have enough to deploy him.  I drain on the ground again, but am getting tired of paying.  One of the cards he looses is Chiraneau.  I wonder why, but don&amp;#8217;t say anything.  I deploy Lando in Falcon with Melas to Fondor to satisfy Battle Order.  We&amp;#8217;re in a drain race, but right now I don&amp;#8217;t have to pay.  After a few turns of cat and mouse in space, I decide to make a stand at Sullust against Thrawn in the DSSD.  He battles and plays Imperial Command.  He draws 6, 5, 6 and I draw a 6.  He overpowers me by a lot, I loose only 4 from my force.  He has to loose Thrawn and the ship because of the attrition +2 from my objective.  I get my 2nd D* Plans and get 8D8 over and he steals them.  Joe drains, but is unable to find his SHUOSHD when he draws.  I drain on my turn and deploy Blount to his bunker for the extra drain.  I complete the plans for 12 force.  This put me over the top.  He gets another ship out to drain at Sullust.  We trade drains.  Next turn when he&amp;#8217;s drawing up, he says, &amp;#8220;FINALLY!&amp;#8221; so I&amp;#8217;m a bit worried.  Nothing I can do though, so I just drain him.  He comes down with an undercover Arcia with Mara&amp;#8217;s Saber to my war room.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t break cover to battle, which I think is strange, but oh well.  During my control phase he breaks Arcia&amp;#8217;s cover to swing and he hits Leia.  I drain.  He Drains.  I drain. He drains. I drain him for his last force.<br>
<br>
FW by 7 10(+72)<br>
Highlights: Great Game<br>
Lowlights: Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down<br>
<br>
Well, Matt Miller beat Brian Hunter like I told him to, but my plan to sneak into first backfired.  Matt was able to take second with his win, Brian Hunter got first.  Brian picked the Alter foil cause he didn&amp;#8217;t have one and Matt got the Imperial decree.  The 3 of us got D*2 for prizes, the rest got JP.  I got majorly shafted with Thunderflare and Green Squadron 3, Brian and Matt also got crap.  The next day I went off to Winter Park for 4 days of great skiing, I had a blast.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Brian Hunter for being a cool guy and winning<br>
Matt Miller for also being cool and for beating Brian Hunter<br>

Mike Raveling because he is the coolest guy I know<br>
A&amp;W Cream Soda for being the best pop ever<br>
My CD player for saving me from having to listen to my parents<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Van Melancon for dropping because I beat him<br>
Fanchi for giving me slops in his report<br>
Rob Farallo for committing suicide<br>
Abyssins for raping Leia<br>
SHUOSHD for canceling my cards<br>
My packs for sucking<br>
Fallen Portal for not being there when I needed it<br>
<br>
That&amp;#8217;s all for now<br>
