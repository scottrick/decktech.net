We arrived at Shumer&amp;#8217;s card store ten minuets before the tournament was to commence.  There was a small turnout, only 8 people.  I sized up my opponents and then the pairings were called. <br>
<br>
The first game I played my neighbor, and the number one Team Milford member, Matt Scott.  I was my dark, and I played rare, unique aliens, MKOS.  I started TINT&amp;OE, No Bargain, and POTH.  Matt was playing a Hidden Base deck.  It was the first time I had ever played a REAL person with this deck.   I got totally thrashed.  Every time I would deploy me beatdown squads he would counteract with a beatdown squad of his own. IE Obi w/ stick and Luke w/ stick along with Leia and her gun and Lando and his gun.  I got demolished every time.  To help this, I never found any of my starships.  So he set up quickly and flipped.  He canceled the force drains I could manage and ruled space with some drainage of his own.  The game was over pretty quick.  I ended up losing by 33.<br>
Conclusion:  Matt Scott is very good.  Don&amp;#8217;t f*ck with him.<br>
<br>
The second game I played Dave Dalton.  I was playing with my TIGIH/ scouts light.  I used HFTMF and started Staging Areas, Strike Planing, and Insurrection.  Dave was playing SYCFA/ Tie Interceptors.  During his first turn I used Strike Planning to pull Crixy and General Solo.  On my first turn I used Insurrection to pull the H1 DB and deployed Crixy there and used him the whole game to pull scouts.  This is always helpful.  While I was setting up a few scouts at every possible site I could drain at, Dave would sit in space at one particular planet, Tatooine.  He sat there w/ a dreadnaught and 2 Tie Interceptors and drained for 1.  When I finally drew H1 and Major Hashh&amp;#8217;n, I deployed it to Endor because I knew he was trying to set up a trap and indeed he was.  After a few turns of only draining, I grew a pair, and decided to move to Tatooine.  He played Gravity Shadow and sent me packing back to Endor.  The Next turn I tempted fate again and decided to move.  He did not play GS so I was happy.  But however on his turn he deployed 3 Interceptors (one with a laser cannon on it), played all power to weapons, and played Relentless Pursuit against H1.  I was screwed.  I ended up losing H1 and about 8 or 9 off the top.  This killed me.  After that battle I could not get home one back w/ my off the edges.  He grabbed my trackers, TMAC and Fall of a Legend.  I decided to try to drain for as much as I could but he stopped some of it.  He played Dark Waters on the Endor DB and on the Back Door.  I was only draining for 4 a turn and not retrieving any.  I would not win this game.  He played a gay inside strategy also to hinder me.  He would deploy a Tie at the DS DB, battle me, and retrieve one with First Strike and I would lose one.  This would continue until he would end up beating me by only 19.<br>
Conclusion:  Had I noticed he was setting me up, I probably would have won.  I also forgot to play I hope She&amp;#8217;s all right.<br>
<br>
The third game I squared off against my arch nemesis, Tyler Martin. Tyler is also my neighbor and the second member of team Milford.  I played my Dark and started the usual.  Tyler played Quiet Mining Colony with some mains w/ their toys.  He played HFTMF to start Menace Fades, Battle Plan, and Squadron assignments.  On my first turn I used JP to pull the Audience Chamber, and the used the AC to pull Jabba and POTH to get Ephant Mon.  I had set up pretty early in the game and started draining for 6 at the JP sites.  Then he got Menace Fades and Battle Plan satisfied, and my drains were cut in half and I had to pay for them.  Every time I would deploy to CC to kill him, he would be gay and run away like the @#$% he is.  He used Dodge and Path and Narrow Escape to stop my battles.  He deployed Dash in the Outrider to Bespoin: CC and then proceeded to move up to Bespin.  Next turn he deployed Han and the Falcon and Hobbie in Red Squad 4.  I was never able to challenge him in space, because a. he had massive power and I&amp;#8217;ll Take the Leader out, and B. I couldn&amp;#8217;t find the damn ships!  Finally I found Boskk and HT and deployed him at Bespin: CC to do some damage however I was just too far behind at that time, and a few turns later I had to draw up to prevent him form retrieving.  I ended up losing by 29.<br>
Conclusion:  Tyler is good and had I had more practice and I wasn&amp;#8217;t so stupid I would stand a chance against my teammates.<br>
<br>
My fourth game was against Mike Jones.  I played his dark.  His deck had no real main theme.  It was a bunch of high power characters and force draining sites.  He used Combat Readiness to deploy the Prefect&amp;#8217;s Office and started the CC: Lower Corridors.  On his first and second turn he set the emperor up at the Lower Corridors along with Sim Aloo and a Royal Guard w/ a Force Pike.  I set up my light as usual.  I used Strike planning to pull Crixy and General Solo and then used insurrection to find the H1 Db and deployed Crixy there.  I used Crixy to pull Chewie and then used Chewie to pull Wuta and then used Wuta to deploy the Back Door.  I set Han, LSJK, And Chewie and Wuta up at the DB.  On my next turn I pulled Corporal Kensaric w/ Crixy and deployed hi to the DB.  I deployed Boushh to neutralize the force drain at the Emperors site.  There she sat the whole game.  There were no other CC sites so the Emperor&amp;#8217;s clan stayed put.  I set about 3 scouts at each site and force drained a lot.  He had deployed Mon Calimari and also deployed Vengeance.  I drew up to find H1 and Major Hashh&amp;#8217;n and deployed to Mon Calimari and beat the snot out of the Vengeance.  So I controlled space after that turn and had no opposition.   Later in the game he deployed Lord Vader along with Tagge and 2 other 2/2 Commanders to the generic docking bay I was force draining at.  He battled and I played Fallen Portal to get rid of the 2/2 Commanders, and then I played Insertion Planning.  Being the jerk he was he lost Vader to satisfy attrition so I had no chance to get Luke captured.  I would have turned Vader too.  I had 4 cards by then with IFTC.  I kicked my self for that one.  The rest of the game was basically me draining for 7 a turn and retrieving w/ on the Edge when I needed to.  I think once he tried a little assault on the generic DB but I used Fallen Portal and Insertion planning again and he was wiped of the board w/ the exception of the Emperor&amp;#8217;s gang.  I ended up wining by 35.<br>
Conclusion: This kid was very easy and he gave me good practice on what to remember and how to use most of my cards, and give me practice on turning Vader.<br>
<br>
My fifth game was against the same kid, Mike Jones.  Only this time he was light and I was dark.  His light was mostly constructed the same.  He had mains and their toys and some 2/1 sites.  He used Careful planning to start a generic docking bay and then also started the Endor Great Forest.  On my first turn I pulled the audience Chamber with the JP game text and then used POTH to pull Ephant Mon.  I deployed Jabba and Ephant Mon together at the AC and passed the turn.  His first few turns were brief.  I think he was drawing to get a card he wanted on each turn.  On my second turn I searched for Bib, found him and deployed him to the lower passages along with the Boelo I drew.  On his turn he set up Green leader and Wedge at the great forest.  There he drained for a few turns while I prepared a Beatdown Squad.  On the next turn I searched for the Sail Barge and deployed it along with the passenger deck.  I deployed Chall Bekan as the driver and used him to search for an Abyssin.  I parked the sail barge at JP and drained there.  I finally drew Gailid and got him going at the AC.  I beat down Green Leader and Wedge w/ an Abyssin, Myo and Dengar w/ BC.  He deployed Leia and LSJK at the generic DB and drained for 2 over the course of 2 turns while I prepared yet another Beatdown Squad.  I rapidly Deployed Fett w/ gun, 4 Lom w/ gun and IG-88 w/ gun.  I captured the 3/3 Leia and canceled Luke&amp;#8217;s game text.  I beat them down and cleared the board.  From there I set up and drained for 8 each turn.  I retrieved the 6 he made me lose w/ Jabba&amp;#8217;s Twerps and 2 w/ First Strike.  I ended up wining by 35 again.<br>
Conclusion:  This kid wasn&amp;#8217;t very good.  He made a lot of careless mistakes that I exploited and took advantage of.<br>
<br>
I think the director was messed up because in my last game I played Mike Jones again, with my light, again.  The game was pretty much the same as before.  I started Insurrection and Strike planning and Staging areas.   He started the CC lower Corridors and the Prefects Office.  During his turn I used Strike planning to pull Crixy and General Solo.  During my turn I pulled H1 DB w/ Insurrection and deployed Crixy there.  I searched for Chewie with his ability and the deployed Han and chewie at the DB and then used Chewie to find Wuta and then used Wuta to get the Back Door.  I moved Chewie, Wuta and Solo to the Back Door and moved Luke over to the DB.  I set my scouts at the battleground sites and drained for a lot.  There was one twist in this story.  He fortified Mon Calimari w/ Vengeance, a generic Star Destroyer, and Saber 2 w/ DS612 piloting and a Tie Interceptor.  I deployed H1 w/ Hashh&amp;#8217;n and killed the two Ties.  I retrieved Home One w/ On the Edge and deployed it again 2 turns later and killed of the remaining Star Destroyers.  I tracked my 6&amp;#8217;s around and retrieved a lot w/ on the edge.  I drained him down and won by 40  to finish the tournament a good 3-3 with a 32 differential.  Here are the final standings.<br>
1. Matt Scott 10(128) <br>
2. Tyler Martin (me) 10(113) <br>
3. Dave Dalton 8(54) <br>
4. Albert Klein 6(32) <br>
5. Andrew Hastings 6(-49) <br>
6. Adam Reidy 4(7) <br>
7. Gary Blackburn 4(-79) <br>
8. Michael Jones 0(-206)<br>
It was very exciting to go out of town and have team Milford go 1,2,4 at the tournament.  It was nice to meet new players and gain more experience at new places.  I am looking forward to Sates very much.<br>
