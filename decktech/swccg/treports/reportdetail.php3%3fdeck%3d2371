May 25-01 lancaster tournament<br>
<br>
Pre tournament:<br>
After coming in 8 in the state and show some progress over last 5 months, i decide to make a new dark side deck. Carbon testing with munipalation. It was first time i ever played a pure ground deck ever. It was mostly bounty hunters, defensive fires and scaning crew. It was time to learn something new and added to repretoar. Also know one ever seen any new good carbon freezing deck.  My light side was brand new WYS and dark side carbon freezing. We have exactly 8 players to start right on time. yippie. Alright, alright i get to the tournament. <br>
<br>
Match 1<br>
me  WYS versus jared (1471)space invasion<br>
<br>
This kid learned how to play week months ago. He is pretty good for limited play. He starts with fondor and no effects. While i start with signal and squadran assignment. In my hand both lukes, wedge, han, chewing gum and 3 harvest and red 10. I am wondering what the hell this kid doing. But, i wait. He Activates and deploys. What a luck, he has 5 systems in his hand. I am thinking oh @#$% this aint good. Than he draws. I activate sht load a force. Now a smile in my face. I go look for kessel and see millieum falcon. Grab both of them. Deploy kessel and han there with his little @#$% hole, and wedge with luke to cantina and flip. I got like three force left so i signal out of my lost pile for nightfall , but aint there. WTF. fine i grab a beggar. I said go. He activates and deploys exec. (the cheap one) to fondor and say go.  Ok, i activate and drain for 5. yippie. I go look for red 10&#146;s friend and grab him. I deploy him and red 10 to executor for simple attack but i got wise as i noticed that no battle destiny, it would suck.  I only my power is weak but its cool . I also deploy chewing gum to falcon to look cool. Then move the red 10 to  sullust and drew. What a draw, owens and the family with farm, hojixs and lukes stick with profiency and my buddy ben with pulsar with outrider. He activates and drains for one (lose a harvest) and deploys 2 victory class to kessel. Yippie. And stops and draws. This kid got like 30 cards in his hand. damm i dont play with grimtash. I activate and drain for 4 and deploy lukes saber and profiency, owens family to farm and luke and look for out rider friend. deploy with against exec. and battle draw a 5 and with power 7 (my) to 8 i lose but my attrition gets the big mama. Clear fondor. Next move attack, victory classes with falcon. I win with massively with 2 great destiny draws of 5 (out of commision). Falcon did his job. And draw one and end my turn. He activates and deploys 4 hoth sites with 5 walkers there. I thinking this is weird. Then says go. i activate and drain for 11 and leave 5 in his reserve deck with a 20 cards in hand. Deploy ben for 11 to docking bay and pass. He drains for 2 at hoth and deploys vader, ozzel, merrick and executor to endor again. He say go. I activate and drain for 12 and drain him out. The kid decided to lose it out of his reserve. Thats game wow....<br>
WF 32<br>
<br>
Goods: nothing I, played against a kid that was scared to play me. After the game i told him that i will help him built a better deck and show him how to play. oh yippie.<br>
Slops: None. He try to avoid me in battle and try win with cheap force drains.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
My bounties are plenty full versus Mike @#$%mens (1738) there is good in him.<br>
<br>
This is a guy who will open up on some with a blind side attack. He is a great guy with lots of heart and playing experince (also my first mentor. I start with carbon chamber and prize with three effects. i activate and look at my hand. Got cc docking and 6 bounties and mara&#146;s stick. A god hand. I deploy audince chamber and tattonie docking bay from reserve deck and deploy ccD out of my hand. My hand looks go with Ig88 with gun, boba with gun, mara and her stick, jodo, xizor, and guri. Deploy ephont mon (from reserve deck) to security tower. Say &quot;force with you.&quot; He activates and gets his generals and says go. I activate and leave my force there. He doesn&#146;t notice my force pile yet. He activates and remembers to force drain so i lose it of the top. It was a defensive fire. He make a remark like ( what the WFK) and laughs. he deploys crix and grabs HO docking bays from reserve and deploys. Moves crix and luke to docking bay. yippie. I am going activate and again say go with one draw. Its a scum and villany. Wow. This is a wopping coming. He does not notice my force pile. he activets and drains for 1. He forgot he had a saber. i dont correct him so. its cool. He deploy bunker and landing site. And deploy three scouts. Says go. I Activate and asmile comes in my face I deploy SV, mara and the entire crew to endor docking bay. He goes @#$%. I see this mass worry in his face. My hand is claered. Nothing there. i capture luke with mara beacuse of her impreal status. ( little arguement, i said no she is a alien and he remind me that mara is a impreal first.) So i take luke a prisoner and poor old crix going help now now now. But no vail. I swing with mara and hit him barerly. A 4 total. yippie. I draw a battle destiny of 2and a 2 my power is 29 to 3. Lost of 26. The game was right there. Its over. He loses entire hand some from lost pile. And i move ig to cc docking bay to escort coffe table to jabba to flip. And draw some. I say go but he say lose two to the objective. He activates and drains for one at the rebel landing site. He deploys crix again from reserve deck. ( Last general he can pull.) And move to attacks to and says go. I activate and decide to run. He doesn&#146;t have anything attack so i move to landing site. And move IG-88 to tattonie docking bay. And draw. My got it was 4 defensive fires and 2 scaning crews and one barier. He activates and drains for one and deploys ben and leia front of me with battle order. He move the rest of the gang over. This aint good. I activate and deploy one alien from reserve deck (jabba) to audience chamber) and move the ig-88 there to finish the coffe table. My brothers at endor starts scrambling around. 3 moves to hut and 2 moves to docking bay. And he reminds me to lose 2. Oh great.... I draw some and decide to use scaning crew. He points at anti scaning crew card. I laughed and said ok. I use defensive fire and empty 4 cards from hand. He activates and drains for 1 and pays three. ok faboulous. i got to drain him out. I he goes after mara and jodo. And stops. I activate and drain for 2 total and retieve one pay 6 for the drain. So i move mara away and drew. I got bossks and rest of bounties. He reminds me of losing 2 again. MF (buts its part of the game so its cool. He activates and deploys more scouts docking bay and i barrier one of them and he draws. I decide to Finish the game so deploy bossk and another bounty there to fight. I won by 17. It was a massacre. It was a good game.<br>
+4 (49)<br>
Highs: have the patiences and the force to come up with a good plan. Not playing ties. <br>
lows: losing 2 to lukes objective<br>
Cool: Taking about tattoning decks. We decide go to LA to but some boxs.<br>
<br>
Game three:<br>
Hidden base flip (david) 1534 vs carbon again.....<br>
<br>
Now before i start talking about the game david knew what i had in the deck. He is a great scouter...its cool i dont mind as long as you dont blur my cards to entire crowd.<br>
<br>
I start with same effects and wondering is this going to be my first lost to david. I dont have any ships in accept jabbas boat. oh yippie. I active and drew a great hand. Search and destroy and lots of scan crew. I grab jabba&#146;s audinece chamber and mara and deploy her with search and destroy. Then say go. He grabs endor, and deploys 6 x-wings to rend. and move free to endor. He remind him lose 1 to search and desrtoy and draws. I active drain for one and deploy ig-88 to security tower and grab the coffee table and start moving. Then i scan his hand. I take out luke and leia. rest is all x-wings. (why i didn&#146;t play monok) i said go. He drains for and deploys kasshk and deploys one x-wing there and draws and loses to search and destory. ( han with blaster)  I activate, a might drain of one and move ig to tDd. I draw and get a scanning crew again. I scan and take out ben. rest is all x-wings. He actives and drains for two and grabs kessel. Deploys one x-wing there. And loses to search and desroy again. I activate and grab maras stick and jabba&#146;s boat. And draw. all bounties. yippie. He actives and drains for three and deploys yavin and sullust and flips. Oh great. no drains now. I activate and reteive one for the coffe table, deploy bossk to ccd bay, jodu to cc chamber, and zukuss and 4 low to tatonie docking and scum and vilanny. Hope to get any drains. holding xizor and guri and jabba boat with two great ghkks. and say go. He drains for 7. And says go. I activate and retieve and deploy jabbas boat to kessel with xi and guri. And probe. he smiles and say no. i Go great. and i run to kasssk. And say go. He activates and drains for 6 and deploys 4 x-wings and battles i lose guri and he loses nothing. oh yeah. this looks gleem. I probe kasshk and its not. I activate and might drain of 2 and retieve one. But i noticed he has 8 force left in the reserve deck. i deploy jabba to the boat with the doctor and battle to reteive two. Its chaep but i dont care at this point. He plays organized attack but jabbas is immunnity helps so nothing lost. I move to endor and say go. He actived 7 and drain for 6. I lose it 4 out of the hand and 2 out of the reserve. His deploy phase i scan the endor and he loses the hidden base. YEEESSSSS He looks at me and says you know what I forgot to add in All wings report in. I smile and say good game. I activate and drain him out.<br>
