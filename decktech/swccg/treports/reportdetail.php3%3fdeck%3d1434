<br>
Ok, I&#146;m going down to the tourney with Casey Barson And Zach Marshall, both of those @#$%es are broke and<br>
carless, so Im able to talk my dad into letting us take the lexus (I cant drive only 15).<br>
Ride down is pretty uneventfull, we pass through indian reservations and amuse ourselves making indian jokes<br>
(they were funny @ least), we get outa indian land and into hickville, and this time we amuse ourselves bumping<br>
rap, and shouting ebonics at the hicks like total wiggers. (they were scared as hell though :)<br>
<br>
We finnaly get to AZ Gamer at 3:00 in the afternoon , find out that Derrick Conklin (who were staying wit, hes from Utah also) isnt there (later we find out the dumbass walked like 8 miles to get to the card shop, when he coulda called and had us pick him up :)<br>
<br>
I meet Kyle Craft and he beats my @#$% in a couple of games (I always lose outside of tourneys though, I get to damn sloppy) , although playing those games with those with him makes me NEARLY perfect my dark deck (it was perfect by day 3)<br>
<br>
We go back to the hotel that derrick got, I put my contacts in and get my @#$% together<br>
<br>
For DS Im playing A SYCFA/whatever back side is / scum deck, KINDA like I grab your ghkk, but ALOT different (in the fact that its 10x better :) Ill post the deck later on decktech<br>
<br>
LS Im playing a deck thats like Ravellings Throne Room (weird thing, I never saw the deck when I made it, the one tourney I took it to,  EVERYONE knew what I was playing, and yet I never saw the deck on decktech or anything, I later checked the deck and it was the same but about 10 cards, 3 goo nee tays and all!)<br>
<br>
Game One<br>
<br>
I remember NOTHING about this game, Only that I was playing Dark, he was playing light, dont remember his name, what he looked like <br>
Oh I also Remember I won by 35, because it put me in first place, and put me in place to play Brian Hunter game 2<br>
<br>
Heres where @#$% gets weird.  Ive seen Brian Hunter ONCE, at the regional like 2 years ago, I scrubbed out, and he took 2nd so I knew who he was.  After I beat my opponent Brian comes up to me and hes all &quot;Jason howd you do?&quot; I&#146;m like WHAT THE @#$%? , I said I wont by 35, He says like you beat me by one card you bastard or something<br>
Whats REALLY weird is anyone who knows Brian Hunter, knows that he looks like Jesus.  Not only that but everyone<br>
calls him Jesus also.  So me and zach go eat at some greasepit and Im telling him how Im tottaly scared because Brian<br>
Hunter Is really Jesus.<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs Brian Hunters Hunt Down Done right<br>
<br>
Well I have to play Jesus, @#$%ing great.  I decide that even though Jesus is perfect he probly cant beat me in cards, so<br>
I talk myself outa being scared.  He probly thought I was a @#$%ing scrub because I go first (throne room) I activate and<br>
I&#146;m all &quot;How many cards do you have in your hand?&quot; I slap myself for being a dumbass and go.  I was tottaly confident I would win this game.  I search for a bothan with nar shadda (4 nar in deck), cancel visage first turn and deploy docking bay and get generals (strike planning) and say go.<br>
He deploys a docking bay and draws and ends turn.  I deploy my other docking bay, and reinforce my bothan with a Hnethme, move to db for more activation and brian give me a look like what the @#$%? So I&#146;m like YES Jesus is scared. <br>
Next turn, Janus? comes down, he doesent have enough force to battle.  Deply crix to db and grab a scout stick him @ docking bay and battle I think.  Dont remember what happens but Janus did run next turn.  Next turn I stick oola at my hoth docking bay.  Im tottaly out activating Jesus and I eventually Oola him.  Vaders go to pile (still no vader out)  Next turn he draws like 80000 cards and Im like @#$%.  I narshadda and find out that  grimtassh is in my force pile so I tunnel vision and scan him, more vaders and @#$% go to used, but I see a mara so Im like @#$% and reinforce my guys.  <br>
Then everything went downhill, somehow he started out activating me and he drew a ton, couldnt scan.  Mara comes down to beat ass, and altough I had him locked down for about 3/4 turns I end up losing by 19 because I couldnt cause any frickin damage, and somehow he got outa the lock by outactivating me (i think its cuz the majority of cards in his hand were interuppts so when I oola and get say 3 characters I just used 16 or so force to send away 3 chars, so he could draw all his force next turn and have more than me.) <br>
<br>
Loss by 19<br>
<br>
Highlights : Great Game, finding out that Brian Hunter is cool (I didnt like him when I found out what he did to Shaner @ the regional a couple years ago, but he has changed)<br>
Lowlights:  Being doomed from the start (I was playing Jesus remember?) , having him lockeddown and not being able to finish it.<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Clint Hays Court or New Obj (cant remember)<br>
<br>
I finnaly get to meet Lt Blount (although he doesent look THAT much like him).  He looks pissed and hes playing me so I know he lost last game.  I thought I would lose, cuz this deck is like anti imperials, and hes playing aliens.  Basically I went down with scouts, beat the @#$% outa of him wit em, and outactivated him madly, then got oola setup and he was dead.  (Luckily this game I was activating enough to COMPLETELY lock him down and drain him enough. (he was losing to his objective like the whole game, that helped me alot.) <br>
<br>
Win by around 30<br>
<br>
Highlights:  Beating him when hes playing court<br>
Lowlights:  Making Hays drop out<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs Kyle Crafts Hidden Base/Mains/Crazy @#$% Activation Deck<br>
<br>
He beat me with this deck before the tourney but I went in this game knowing I would win.  Before the game hes all &quot;Your the one who made Clint drop out and go cry, good job&quot;  I&#146;m like ehehehe thanks.  Then he&#146;s all But if you beat me and Clint I&#146;m gonna have to kick you in the nuts, I&#146;m like might as well kick me now and get it over with :)<br>
All I remember is Im activating like my 16+ force by turn 4 (normal for my deck as long as I dont get jewed), and he leaves crix and like chewie or someone at a docking bay.  Hes got alot in his hand, so I monnok used, go down with mara , jabba, boelo 4lom and iggy (I think)  Catch Chewie, hit crix, and draw my 4 destiny, I do like 30 or so battle damage.  Get my drains for 6 off the top at jabbas palace (gallid + mosep) , retrive a few and win by like 30+ I think.<br>
<br>
Highlights:  Winning, playing Kyle Craft, hes @#$%ing cool<br>
Lowlights:  None @ all<br>
<br>
Game 5 vs Tim Mcknight<br>
<br>
He came down with Kyle, and hes playing a deck very similar to his, I cant remember anything about this game, but I think<br>
I got my galid / mosep going for the 6 off the top mid way into the game, and choked him wit no bargain/ bfhi/ none shall passes<br>
<br>
Game 6 vs Cant remembers his names Huntdown.<br>
<br>
Somehow..... He whooped my @#$% like a little biatch.  I canceled his visage 1st turn, came out fighting, made him lose about 6 force for drains and made it impossible for him to deploy to executor and get his visage going (hnethme+kensairic+goo nee tay = 11 force for vader) He trows down CHYBC,  Couldnt find an oola, and he @#$%ing throws vader and tarkin to back door or something (he was playing old skool huntdown) and he throws down downtown plaza with like 2 blizzard walkers and firfeit pilots and somehow I manage to lose by 30+ (no idea how)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Taking out everyone on the executor<br>
Lowlights:  Having the game won AGAIN and losing<br>
<br>
So I end up in like like 6th or 7th place (that wasnt BAD though considering there were around 50 ppl there, and I knocked off Kyle and Clint, and one of my losses was from Jesus himself)  I get @#$% for prize support but oh well @#$% it I only payed 3.50 anyways.<br>
<br>
Day 3 tourney report will come soon (day2 I scrubbed out, took out my secret plans the night before and lost to a training deck, and my light deck sucked total @#$%!, Chadra Fans what the @#$% was I smoking), went 4-4 3-1 with darkside (told you lost to training cuz I took out @#$%ing secret plans like a dumbass) Ill give a report on the final confrontations both days 1+2 though.  It was funny as @#$%. Clint Hays was making his smartass comments the whole time (we were in a different room watching from a video camera)  So Im going to put all the funny @#$% quotes in my next report<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
<br>
Mike Girard for running it smoothly and buying everything I win, and not giving me warnings for my foul @#$% mouth :)<br>
Brian Hunter for proving that he does deserve his rating (well he did that the whole weekend) and in my mind is the best player in the world right now, also for converting from his jewish religion (talking about what he did to shaner at the regional 2 yrs ago), this year he played tottaly fair, I was next to him like 5 games day 3 (I was in 2nd place like whoe time baby :), and he was even letting ppl take @#$% back, so mad props to him.<br>
Derrick for getting us a hotel the first night<br>
Kyle Craft for being the coolest opponent I have ever played, hes @#$%ing bad ass! And for not kicking me in the nuts when I beat him<br>
Zach for getting better and going 4-2<br>
Adam Sandler for giving us something other than music to listen to on our trips<br>
Everyone staying with me for lending me cards because I hardly own any<br>
Kids in the Dennys Parking lot for getting in a fight (was funny @#$%)<br>
Clint Hays and all the other @#$%s in the room during the final confrontation (ill have quotes next time omg it was funny)<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
<br>
Machine taking my money at AZGamer<br>
Casey for playing YJ days 1 AND 2<br>
Brian Hunter for making me think he really was Jesus and psyching me out :P<br>
That greaseball resturaunt we ate at.<br>
Me for scrubbing out both times I was winning wit my LS<br>
Zach for eating the brownie that night, having to go to Dennys at 3:00 in the morning and making me get no sleep <br>
Dennys for giving us a bull@#$% excuse about &quot;you cant play cards here, we dont have a liquor license and thats gambling&quot; or some @#$%ing bull@#$% when I bought @#$%ing hashbrowns and Zach bought a @#$%ing brownie and we all know that they only said that because they didnt want use playing games on there tables<br>
Me for playing Chadra @#$%ing fans Day 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Ill have my next report of day 3 and the final confrontations up in a couple of days <br>
<br>
Later for now<br>
