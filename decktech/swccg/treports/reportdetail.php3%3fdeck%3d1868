Well, I guess I&#146;m a weakling because I only played in the first tournament.  I was running on 3 hours of sleep so one was all I could handle.<br>
<br>
I had been playtesting off and on for 2 weeks prior to this so I felt pretty confident about my decks.  I made sure to tech for Watch Your Step of course.  Aside from that I was prepared for mains decks and space(EBO, hidden base).  For light side I prepared for all the usual(Scum, Hunt down, Bring Him, Ties).<br>
  My decks:<br>
<br>
  LS There is Good In Him<br>
        Starts Strike Planning and uses Generals, scouts, and some mains.  Five 6&#146;s in the deck so I can turn vader after 3 battles.  Also 1st turn surprises with Yoda Stew if they go for Luke.<br>
<br>
  DS Carbon Chamber Testing<br>
        Non scum version(because Vader is the man) using mains.  Primarily a battle deck which will take Jabba&#146;s Prize and flip if my opponent gives me nothing to do.<br>
<br>
Game 1, My LS There is Good in Him vs. Mason&#146;s Hunt Down<br>
<br>
He starts Epic Duel, Mobilization Points, Imperial Arrest Order, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  I start Strike Planning, Insurrection, Your Insight Serves You Well.<br>
First turn he pulls his docking bays and stuff.  I pull General Madine and Solo.  We both lose to Visage.  I also discard YISYW to get Honor of the Jedi.  My turn get Home One docking bay.  Deploy Crix and Corporal Kensaric there.  Deploy Honor.  Move Luke to Landing platform.  He loses to Visage(hehe).  His turn pulls another docking bay, deploys No Escape(doh!), and Prince Xizor to Cloud City docking bay.  We lose to Visage.  My turn generate mega force, drain for 2 with Luke.  I pull Hoth docking bay, Lieutenant Blount with Crix.  Blount cancels Visage along with General Calrissian for backup.  I draw some and save force.  He drains for 1 with Xizor.  Deploys Mara Jade with her Saber to Xizor, also gets another docking bay.  My turn, drain 2 with Luke, 2 at the Holotheatre(they would drain there the rest of the game).  I laugh because by now he has lost 2 Vader&#146;s Obsessions to drains and Visage.  Time to beat down on Xizor and Mara.  I pull Craken with Madine.  Deplay him, General Solo, and Leia with Blaster to CC docking bay.  Battle, play Rebel Leadership to add one, he hits Solo with the saber, I hit Xizor with Leia&#146;s blaster, I draw 3 destiny to his one, my draws are average, his is good, I lose Solo and Cracken, he loses both but no battle damage, and he stacks one.  Crix and Kenaric transit to back up Leia.  His turn deploys Premiere Vader with DSII saber and captures Luke, transits to Death Star docking bay.  My turn drain with Leia but forgot about Their Fire is Gone out of the Universe, dammit!  No problem.  I draw some more trying to get a crew to go kill Vader.  His turn drains with Vader(only 1, gotta love the dueling saber).  He deploys The Emperor to Coruscant docking bay, Grand Moff Tarkin to DS docking bay, transits Emperor, and puts a Precense of the Force to DS docking bay.  Hmmmm, time for me to set up some more drains.  I deploy Wuta to Landing platform, with Chewbacca of Kashyyk.  Use Wuta to pull Back Door.  At this point I have EPP Obi Wan in my hand, but I&#146;m reluctant to deploy him because if he won a duel the game could turn his way.  So I transit Leia to H1 db since she can&#146;t drain, Crix and Kensaric go to LP.  I draw some more.  I&#146;ve decided I need to get Weapon Levitation so I can go up against Vader.  I don&#146;t think he&#146;ll duel me if I can snatch his saber.  But I don&#146;t get it.  He drains for 2.  Deploys Mara to H1 db with 4lom.  Battles, blanks Leia&#146;s text, he draws low and so do I, he loses 4lom, I lose Leia.  Mara then transits for 7 force to DS db(coward, heh).  My turn drain at LP.  Deploy Rebel Landing site with Wuta.  Move the scout crew to Back Door.  His turn he drains and draws some more.  My turn, drain for 4 total, he loses The Circle is Now Complets and a DSII saber.  Hmmm. I think Obi&#146;s safe now.  Deploy him to Rebel Landing site, move Chewie over to back him up.  He drains, decides its time to stop my draining, and transits everyone to LP.  I drain, draw up, waiting for him to come to me.  He drains.  Moves Vader, Tarkin and Mara to Back Door, but not Emperor(hehe, I have to remind him), he goes back to DS.  I drain, move Obi and Chewie back over to Back Door, and lay the trap.  He battles me, I Weapon Lev vader&#146;s Saber and he doesn&#146;t look to happy now, Obi Hits Tarkin(he didn&#146;t cancel), I play Rebel Leadership to add one, I draw 5 and 6(cancels 6), he draws a 5, I lose the battle and forfeit Kensaric to cover 5 battle damage, he forfeits Janus I think.  My turn I battle, hit Vader with the tracked 6, but I draw low so he just loses Vader, I lose Wuta(poor Ewok).  Its over for him, Mara has Luke now and runs away.  I drain and then he draws up.<br>
<br>
FW(+13)<br>
<br>
Good: Waiting to put Obi down at the right time.<br>
Bad:  Thinking Honor would help, then he puts down No Escape<br>
Ugly:  The crew he had at DS.  Never really got what I needed to go to him.<br>
<br>
Game 2, My DS Carbon Chamber Testing vs. Sean Pon&#146;s Watch Your Step<br>
<br>
<br>
This sucks, Sean is one of my friends from the Davis crew.  We playtested these decks already about 3 times.  Every game I had a slight advantage and usually won.  This game wasn&#146;t any different.<br>
He starts Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Squadran Assignments.  I start IAO, MB Points, and Crush the Rebellion.  I get a crap hand with no Characters or ships, but some good interrupts.  I pull Carida, Audience Chamber, and Executor DB.  Draw up and get Dark Lord of the Sith and his saber, cool.  He pulls H1 db, draws everything.  He has about 15 cards in hand.  I use Crush and pull Evader/Monnok.  He&#146;s back down to 8.  I guess he had a bad hand too.  I pull CC db, Death Star II db.  Deploy Vader, saber to CC security tower.  I pull out Jabba&#146;s Prize and move over to begin the trek to the Audience Chamber.  Normally I wouldn&#146;t do this since I have no more characters in hand, but I&#146;m holding an Imperial Barrier and You Are Beaten so I figure I&#146;m safe.  I was, he just pulls Hoth db, draws up to about 15 cards again and , you guessed it, Monnok him before the end of his turn.  I drain for 2, pull Tatooine db,transit Vader over, draw and then save force for my interrupts.  The last Monnok didn&#146;t hit him too bad, he deploys Nightfall on Tatooine, down comes Lando with Vibro which I barrier, Boush(breaks cover) with Anakin&#146;s saber, and Corran Horn.  He agonizes over whether to battle and finally does.  I weapon lev his saber, swing and hit Leia, play You are Beaten on her, I&#146;m thinking I&#146;m gonna beat the @#$% out of Corran, he draws 7 for Nightfall power, then a 1 for destiny(whew), I draw 2 for power, and a 1, Corran wins the battle!  I lose 1 for battle damage, and Leia is lost.  My turn deploy Janus and Grand Admiral Thrawn to Vader, and put I Had No Choice on Lando(great Tech against WYS) which he cancels with We&#146;ll find Han(WTF!  this is something he had been asking me about earlier, if he should put it in, well it sure worked out).  No problem though.  I battle, choke Lando, so he plays On the Edge to suicide Corran(good move).  I move over to Chamber to flip.  His turn he just draws(but not over 12, hehe).  I drain, retrieve, and draw.  He then comes down with Lando with Vibro again(jeez),Jedi Luke with his saber, and Theron Nett(choke bait).  He battles, fails to exclude Thrawn and so hits him instead, I choke Theron, hit Lando and play Dark Strike, we both draw low for power and destiny, he loses a few to keep Luke out and I lose Thrawn.  He moves Luke to Tat db.  My turn I drain for 2, retrieve and deploy Boba Fett with Blaster to the Chamber.  I have disarmed in hand so I move Vader over.  His turn I disarm Luke(darn no Dr. Evazan though).  He deploys Kessel, Outrider with Dash and Melas, moves Luke to the Cantina(Vader and Luke chase back and forth the rest of the game).  My turn drain and retrieve.  In my hand I&#146;ve got Chimaera, Death Squadron Star Destroyer, and Bossk in Hound&#146;s Tooth, but I don&#146;t have enough force to throw down.  So I deploy the DSSD to Tat system and save force hoping he&#146;ll come to me.  This also gave me 3 battlegrounds for Resistance which I deployed earlier.  He drains for 3(2) and just stays at kessel.  That&#146;s fine.  My turn drain, retrieve.  I also drew Thrawn(retrieved) last turn :)  Deploy Chimaera and him to Kessel.  Lateral Damage Outrider(great Tech against this ship, not to mention great card all around).  Battle, I draw 7 in battle destiny, he draws low, He loses everything and still owes 4 on battle damage.  His turn he just draws.  I drain, retrieve, move Chimaera To Tat.  He deploys Millinium Falcon with Dash and Talon Karrde to Kessel.  My turn drain, retrieve, deploy Bossk and Dengar in Punishing One to Kessel.  Battle, I draw good enough to kill Dash but not Karrde, I lose Dengar to his attrition.  Switch Bossk and Chimaera.  He doesn&#146;t want to mess with Chimaera so he moves Karrde(alone) to Tat.  I drain, retrieve, battle and kill Karrde and the Falcon.  At this point he&#146;s spent and draws up his few remaining force.<br>
<br>
FW(+19)<br>
<br>
Good: I had every interrupt I needed at the right time.<br>
Bad: Sean for drawing over 12 twice in a row and getting Monnoked<br>
Ugly: Vader.  He is the man.  Lasted the whole game and killed 7 characters with minimal help.<br>
<br>
Game 3, My CCT vs. Jeff Field&#146;s Mind What You Have Learned test to 1<br>
<br>
I have played SWCCG since it came out and I&#146;ve learned that there are two types of good decks:  the ones that kick your @#$% in battles but are still fun to play against, and the ones that annoy the #$%^ out of you and still beat you.  His deck was the latter.<br>
He starts Battle Plan, Do or Do Not/Wise Advice, and Your Insight Serves You Well.  I start same as Game 2.<br>
I get no characters again.  So I pull locations and draw, getting EPP Vader and Dr. E.  He pulls Dagaboh crap, deploys Daughter of Skywalker.  At this point I&#146;m thinking its a standard Test to 5 or 6, so I need to drain as fast as possible.  I pull more locations, deploy Vader and Dr. E., pull out the prize and move to CC db.  He pulls more crap, deploys Yoda and Test 1.  I drain for 1, deploy 4lom to Tat db, deploy Bossk and DIPO to Carida satisfying Battle Plan.  Move the prize to Tat db.  His turn fails Test 1(which he would do 3 more times, I think he stopped trying when he saw I couldn&#146;t get any force drain bonuses out, which sucked by the way).  He inserts Anger, Fear, Aggresion. @%^$, *^#$.  I&#146;m not hesitant about expressing my dislike for inserts(especially numbers, anyone that thinks otherwise can kiss my @$$).  He also deploys Polarized Negative Power Coupling.  My turn I drain and deploy Xizor with Chamber game text.  Move over to flip.  He plays Visored Vision to make me lose 1 force.  I had a grabber but no force saved, dammit!  Next few turns are lame.  I drain, retrieve.  He inserts, plays VV, and Stone Piles which got my grabber, Lateral Damage, Thrawn, and Palpatine, $#!^.  Oh, and if you ever played with Polarized Negative Power Coupling you know how annoying this card is.  I kept forgetting to turn my cards over.  Funny thing was, so did he.  Guess he hadn&#146;t played this deck much.  The other thing that pissed me off was he would ask me to slow down spending my force so he could see my cards.  And he would pick up his whole used pile to look at his cards.  I asked him to stop because PNPC says &quot;reveal&quot; cards as you spend them.  Paul Feldman(CA state champ)is right next to us so he asks him if thats right and Feldman agrees with me.  He finally does something and deploys Kessel, with Falcon, Corran, Chewie w/ and Artoo/Threepio.Hmmm.  My turn AFA pops and I have 17 force activated.  Executor is in my hand but not enough for Tarkin also.  I figure I can at least get around AFA though.  So I deploy it and battle, I forget Chewie adds one with Threeepio, he draws 5 and 6, so I lose 5 on battle damage rather than the Big E.  I run to Dagobah, heh.  He drains, does some more lame $#!^.  Moves Falcon to Dagobah because Order to Engage is out.  I cancel it with Point Man(great card, if just for that).  I drain, retrieve, move back to Kessel.  He follows.  I drain, retrieve(I&#146;ve only been draining for 2 the whole game which sucks).  Deploy DSSD to Kessel and wait.  He battles draws  5 and 6, I draw low and don&#146;t break his immunity.  The DSSD bites it.  My turn deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.  Battle, draw low, but its enough for about 8 battle damage, he loses Obi Wan to Mantellian Savrip which he deployed earlier.  He deploys Luke w/ to pilot Falcon.  Battles and draws, you guessed it, 5 and 6, I draw low, Zuckuss bites it.  He also put EPP Obi at Carbonite Chamber this turn.  My turn drain, retrieve.  I have Tarkin in hand and that&#146;s it so I can&#146;t hit Obi this turn.  I put Tarkin on Exec to go down in glory one last battle.  I move Xizor and 4lom towards Obi.  Draw and get Janus.  He deploys Sprial.  Battles, draws 5 and 6, I draw 2, Exec goes down with Tarkin, and he uses Yoda&#146;s Hut to subtract from attrition, great.... My turn drain, retrieve.  At this point it is very close, but he&#146;s got a big drain at Kessel and Carbon Chamber plus VV&#146;s every other turn.  I want to kill Obi with Janus but figure he&#146;ll hit him and draw a 6, while my draws have been complete @$$ this game.  So I move Xizor and 4lom closer.  He drains, deploys Melas to Obi and moves Melas to Sec tower.  I deploy Janus and battle Melas, they kill each other.  Next turn his drains finish me off.<br>
<br>
FL(-4)<br>
<br>
Good:  My Favorite Decoration.  After 4th turn I retrieved 1 every turn.  Nice.<br>
Bad:  My battle destiny draws the entire game.<br>
Ugly: His whole deck.  It was one big pile of annoyance.<br>
<br>
Game 4, My TIGIH vs. Dan&#146;s ISB Operations<br>
<br>
He starts IAO, MB points, and Oppressive Enforcement.  I start Strike Planning, Staging Areas and Insurrection.<br>
His turn pulls locations and draws.  My turn drain 1, pull Crix, Solo, Hoth db, and Kensaric.  Deploy Crix and Kensaric to Hoth db. Deploy Back Door.  Move Luke to Back Door.  Draw.  He pulls another docking bay and draws, cool.  I activate tons and drian for 3.  Pull Blount but I have no ship for him to go to Coruscant(he had Carida out also).  So I draw for some characters.  He just deploys a docking bay and Hoth: 3rd marker, draws. I activate tons, drain for 3.  Deploy Solo and DOS to 3rd marker.  Move Crix and Kensaric to join them.  His turn he puts Tempest 1 at Back Door with Tempest Scout 1 and Captain Jonus piloting to capture Luke.  Fine by me, except that I have all my guys on Hoth.  Then he puts Admiral Ozzel at 3rd marker, Undercover, damn.  He moves TS1 to LP and loses 2 to my objective.  I drain for nothing and activate crap.  But he has no ability with TS1 and Jonus.  I pull Cracken, deploy him, Blount, and Chewie, Protector to LP.  He had 1 force saved which I Frozen Assests&#146; since I expected barrier.  No barrier but he played Operational as Planned, heh.  I battle, he reacts with Tempest Scout 6, tramples Cracken, I cancel Jonus game text with Chewie, we both draw low, he loses TS6, I lose Blount and am a bit worried since I have no force, and no characters in hand.  His turn drain 2 at Back Door.  Deploys Officer Evax to LP and.....that&#146;s it, whew.  He battles, I cancel Jonus game text(2 less power), he draws a 0!, he loses 1 on battle damage.  He loses 2 for Luke.  My turn I look for a scout with Crix but there is none.  So I suicide Chewie by battling, he draws low and Chewie covers.  I move the Hoth crew to db since I need to get to Endor.  He drains for 3, deploys ZIMH to Carida satisfying Battle Plan, and Lt. Pol Treidium to LP, loses 2 for Luke.  I am wondering where Vader is at.  I deploy Chewie of K and Wuta against T1 alone at Back Door.  Battle, reacts with TS1, oops forgot about that, he draws good and they both die, he loses Lt. Poltry.  I move Hoth crew to H1 db.  He drains for 2.  Deploys Emperor and Janus to Back Door(ugh).  Moves TS1 to LP.  I deploy Independence to Carida with Corran and Nien Numb.  Battle, I draw low, he draws a 6!, kills both my characters but Independence stays, he loses ZIMH.  I drain there and satisfy Battle Plan rest of the game.  Move Hoth crew to LP.  He drains for 3 at Back Door(did I say &quot;ugh&quot; yet).  Deploys EPP Vader to LP to take Luke, about time.  Doesn&#146;t battle though.  Moves Emperor and Janus into Chirpa&#146;s Hut.  I deploy EPP Obi to LP and Battle.  Play Rebel Leadership, Insertion Planning, and hit a scrub with Obi&#146;s saber.  He hits Solo.  I win by a few and he forfeits Vader because I would have 5 cards stacked after that battle, I lose Solo and Kensaric.  I move 2 guys to block Back Door drain.  Last few turns were cat and mouse with us both draining and him losing to Luke.  But I edge him out in the end.<br>
<br>
FW(+4)<br>
<br>
Good:  Chewie not getting his butt kicked when I had no back up for him.<br>
Bad:  Killing Vader in battle when I could have sat back and turned him by drawing a 3.<br>
Ugly:  Luke caused about 15-20 force loss entire game, Back Door drains, and objective.<br>
<br>
So I go 3-1 and am pleased.  But I&#146;m tired and hungry so  decide not to play in the next tourney especially when I find out there is prize support only at the very end in 18 more hours.  Great, I payed $5 for nothing(well I guess a few rating points).<br>
Thanks for reading.<br>
<br>
Props<br>
Chewie for hanging in there.<br>
Vader for being a killing machine.<br>
