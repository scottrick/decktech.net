The local shop decided that Star Wars players were too loud and swore too much, which offended the little pokemon players, so they used that, and the fact that none of us bought cards at the store(due to over pricing) to throw us out, so the closest tournaments are about once every 2 or 3 months, about 45 minutes away in oswego, which is a pain in the @#$% for me, so usually I dont bother going. <br>
<br>
I heard about state championships about 3 weeks before. I think it was Jared Napolitano, who was talking about PA states that reminded me, but no matter who it was, i checked and found that Altered States, The @#$% store that wont even let local Star Wars Tournies go on there anymore, was hosting the States.<br>
<br>
I began deckbuilding the day i was reminded of the tourney. I first build a WYS deck, that was similar to all the @#$% WYS decks you see going around, basically it used like 6 starships, a @#$%load of smugglers, and 3 jedi lukes. After playtesting it a few time, i relized that the deck was @#$% and re-built the thing into a trendy as @#$% palace raider deck.For the dark side I started with Hunt down, then switched to a court deck that used 5 vaders, 4 maras, 2 emperors, and 3 evazan/ponda boba combos. the deck was pretty cool, but just never got the job done against palace raiders, and had a rough time with other popular decks around here, so it ended up changing again to a ISB space deck. Not like Brian Hunters, more like the one i used to run, with the undercover probots, oh, switch off, and 3 never yalnal to get rid of coran horn.<br>
<br>
I playtested the decks everynight against the locals, and though my dark decks seemed to change around every day, they would still win, i just didn&#146;t feel confortable with them. My Palace Raiders never lost in playtesting. SO the week goes by and by thursday night, i was playing BHBM Ties(props to steve lewis), and thats when my attention was drawn to the AOBS objective. I built a quick agents deck and beat the @#$% out of mike alt with it in a matter of minutes. So i was feeling pretty confident with my decks at this point.<br>
<br>
Friday, the night before the tournament, i got out of work and went to denny&#146;s for some Brownie Tech(Props to Clint)with Jon Schultz, who of course decided to bring a chick with him, without telling me he was, if he had i would have brought a girl with me as well, but anyways, we go to the denny&#146;s in mattydale. Mattydale, for those of you who havent been there, which is most of you, is like a white harlem, its full of white trash and such scum, if your black, you wouldnt dare to go there. So were eating in denny&#146;s and Jon and this girl are talking about masturbation, or some @#$% like that,and im not paying attention(thankfully) because im trying to get the @#$%ing waitress&#146; attention to get me a @#$%ing refill, which takes her about 45 minutes, and since i&#146;m eating buffalo wings, i need another one about 10 minutes later. She takes my dessert order, and i ask for a refill. She brings the brownie, but no @#$%ing drink. So i&#146;m sitting there eating, and as anyone who has eaten one knows, the cake gets pretty dry once you run out of ice cream, so im struggling to eat, since the @#$%ing waitress still has brought me my @#$%ing refill. She come over and starts spray down the table next to us, and accidently squirts me with the damn spray bottle, and goes &quot;oh, im sorry, did i spray you&quot; and I say &quot;Yeah, you @#$%ing did, but its ok, all i want is my god damn refill&quot; and she apologizes and brings me my drink.and i get down to the last bit of the brownie, which happens to be a nice big spoonfull of the thick black frosting they put on the cake, so i look at it, and think &quot;@#$%, this is gonna be @#$%ing nasty&quot; but i eat it anyways.and were ready to go, Jon made a crucial mistake and decided not to get a Brownie, @#$%ed himself over for the next days tourney.<br>
<br>
So we&#146;re bringing his chick home, and she keeps talking about her sex life with us, and im thinking &quot;damn woman, how bad do you want to get laid&quot; but i didnt say anything. So we drop her off and we&#146;re heading back to my pad to grab my cards and @#$%, and we&#146;re talkng and Jon&#146;s like &quot;anytime im with a girl, all we talk about is sex&quot; and i&#146;m like &quot;who gives a @#$%? most guys would say thats a good thing&quot; We end up getting to Jons pad, and he starts building his decks, as i tweek mine(for the first of like 6 times that night) and we pop in a movie, don&#146;t remeber what it was, but it was pretty good. So its like 1 am before Jon&#146;s decks are done and we start to play...he gets a few lucky draws on fallen portals, and ends up beating my dark deck by like 10 force. Theres a few things i dont like about it, so i change a few cards, and he changes from MWYHL to TIGIH and we play again. I drop emperor to endor docking by first turn to @#$% his activation, and end up flipping second turn and staying flipped all game, since luke was captured. I deployed Presence to Cheif&#146;s hut, and drained the @#$% out of him all game,i decided, since he was playing NO space what so ever, to throw Presence on coruscant system, deploy bossk in hound to the coruscant docking bay, move xizor back to the coruscant docking bay, put him about the ship, and move it up, so he couldnt flip my objective back by killing xizor. i drained the @#$% out of him..my droids kicked his @#$% in battle, i sensed a fallen portal or 2, and i won the game by like 25 or 30 cards. He decided to go back to MWYHL. <br>
<br>
by now its like 3:30 and we&#146;re watching episode 1, and Jon is trying his dark deck against my palace raiders. I beat the @#$% out of him. He tried a carbon freezing skrilling deck, and it ate @#$%, then he decided to play a SYCFA tie deck, and my light deck lost for the first, and only time through playtesting. We play another game with my dark deck, and he wins it in the end by like 7 or 8 cards, all because of obi&#146;s @#$%ing journal. Then he took my light deck and played it against my dark deck, and i beat him by 38 force.i look out the window and its light out, and i ask him what time it is and he&#146;s like &quot;oh, its 8:00&quot; so im like &quot;cool&quot; and i go and sit in this @#$%ing bamboo chair in his living room, and sit there, and sit there, and Jons dad calls and is asking to borrow cards and @#$%, and i eventually fall asleep about 9:00.<br>
<br>
Jon woke me up at 10:00 am, and is like &quot;dude, come on, we gotta go&quot; so i hop in the car completely dazed and we drive to Altered states, where we meet up with his dad, Jeff Cisz, Tony Vigliotti, and Mike Alt in the parking lot, shoot the @#$% for a little while, and go inside. When we get in its like 10:30, and everyone has they&#146;re deck lists done, so i start mine, but people wont stop talking to me. The terwilligers congradulate me on the baby, and keep calling me &quot;Bat-Dad&quot; matt sokol comes over and says hello and i try to scare him by telling him that all the local players are using Ops(which some actually are) and numbers(which none are)I end up being the last to finish my deck lists, and then about 5 minutes later, we started the tourney.<br>
<br>
I was using my WYS Palace Raiders(like just about every big player there) and my AOBS(like just about every big player there) which has been tweeked to the max.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Palace Raiders vs. Gerald Moravanski?&#146;s pile.<br>
Ok, this guy starts out with the endor system, combat readiness, and the forest clearing. First turn he deploys Colonal Davod Jon to the forest clearing, draws a couple, and lets me go. I get a a tunnel vison/control combo in my opening hand so i play it, deploy the lars farm and the space port docking bay, draw 2 cards, and let him go. His turn he deploys 1 chimera to endor, and lets me go. I&#146;m like &quot;@#$%, this guy is gonna give me the game that easily?&quot; so i activate, deploy dash and the outrider to the Spaceport docking bay, deploy epp luke, 2 patrol crafts and 2 palace raiders to battle Davod Jon, flip my objective, then battle. I hit with lukes stick, draw 2 5&#146;s and a 4 for destiny, compaired to his impressive 0, and he loses a @#$%load. I move dash to tatooine system, and let him go. He drains me at endor, he then deploys merjek to the forest clear and tells me to go, as if saying &quot;here, kick my @#$% again&quot; so i drain him at tatooine,and battle him, he throws down tempest scout 6, and im thinking &quot;your so @#$%ing clever, im gonna kick your @#$% anyways&quot; so i hit merjek with luke, draw a 2, a 5, and a 2 for destiny, he draws a 3,and loses more force, so hes down to like 10, and i lose a palace raider for attrition, i draw 4 cards and let him go. He drains me at endor again., deploys another starship to endor, and moves them to tatooine, and lets me go. I drain him for 2 at the clearing, deploy owen &amp; beru for free to the farm, and a palace raider/patrol craft combo. i then use the falcon to search for han, deploy them to the docking bay, move them up for free. retrieve all but 2 with harvest, and let him go. He must think my ships will beat his 2 destoyers asses, cause he runs his @#$% back to endor, i drain for a total of 4, move the palace raider and craft to the tat. docking bay, and let him go. he has 2 cards in his hand, and 4 in deck. he drains at endor, and he lets me go. I drain him for a total of 5, move my ships to end, and next turn he draws his 1 card up. <br>
Result: FW 2(+32)<br>

Game 2: Agents vs. Jon Schultz&#146;s MWYHL Mains.<br>
So we are both like &quot;what the @#$%&quot; since we had played this game all night the night before, and we basically knew exactly what needed to happen for either side to win. So i start with staging areas, imperial arrest order, and crush the rebellion, because jon likes to cancel my presence of the force with clash, so now i can just lose 1 force instead of the presence. So i get a pretty nice openeing hand, grab the coruscant docking bay and kuat, deploy them both, moved xizor to the docking bay, draw up, and let him go. He gets yoda out to the hutt, deploys the training area from hand,the tatooine docking bay from deck, and lets me go. I activate, grab the death star docking bay, but dont deploy it. I deploy the emperor to the tat. docking bay,deploy a vigo there, and move xizor over, flipping my objective. Jon actiaves, and grabs the cloud city DB and deploys it, saves his force, and lets me go. I drain him for 2, and he loses 1 to my objective.turns out he lost Yoda&#146;s gimer stick, rebel scout luke, and oola. So i grab a force lightning, put a emperor back to look at the force pile, and i see that i have a couple of my characters, bossk in hound, a twilek, and 2 prescence of the force, so i look at my destiny, draw until i have what i want, and i let him go. Jon activates, deploys a obi-wan and a Jedi Knight Luke to the CC Docking Bay. He then lets me go. I play the twi&#146;lek to grab you cannot hide forever. I activate, and drain him for 1, then deploy it. I then deploy guri, djas, 4-lom with gun, and IG with gun. I deploy 1 Presence to the Tat. Docking bay, and 1 to coruscant. I deploy bossk in hound to coruscant, battle at the docking bay. Jon plays fallen protal on 4-lom, and misses. I cancel lukes game text, try to capture him, but draw 3 and miss. i play jabba is through with you, and draw my three destiny, which were enough to knock out obi-wan. he drew a 2, and i chose to lose djas. i let him go. In his turn he drained me for 1, deployed epp leia, chewie protector, and another obi-wan. He then deployed anakins saber on luke. He then let me go. I drained him for 1 and 2, deployed battle plan, and drew a couple. He eventually got out epp han, and corran horn. We battled a few times at the CC docking bay,and my 3 droids ended up dieing, he also had added a copuple of ships and ended up taking out bossk in hound with Red leader in red 1. He moved his hit squad to tat. docking bay to try to slow my drains, the game was pretty close at this point..i had drawn a couple of bad destiny, and lost alot of cards to battle damage when he got jedi presence off. I got all 3 drods back down to the tat. docking bay, bane and boba fett joined them. by the end of our battleing, i had 3 in hand, 3 in force, and 3 in researve. he had obi-wan at the tat. docking bay, and i had emperor and 4-lom there, with 4-lom escorting luke as a captive. After looking for a docking bay, i knew that my 3 destiny&#146;s were a 5, a 5, and a 1. I played force lightning on obi during his turn, drew a 5, and thanks to you cannot hide for ever making him defence value -1, killed him off. During my turn, i drained at the tatooine docking bay, and he plays lost in the wilderness. draws a 4, and chooses 4-lom to go missing, so luke is free. I deploy no escape, and take the force lightning into hand. i look for a docking bay just in case the 1 was now on top, and shuffle the  3 cards. i have a 2 in 3 chance, so i play the force lightning, and draw a 5, luke was gone.I let Jon go. Jon deploysepp han to the docking bay, and plays on the edge, ended up retreiving the lost in the wilderness. He then let me go. I battled han, and his forfit covered the damage. I let him go. He activaded, and drew a couple of cards.I knew he had that lost in the wilderness, so i searched for 4-lom, found him with a 5, and moved them both to the CC docking bay.Jon knows he cant do anything now, so he draws his last 5 cards, and thats the game.2 minutes before the time out.<br>
Results: FW 4(+38)<br>
Highlights: Beating a good player, it was a great game.<br>
Lowlights: Beating a good friend.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Agents vs. Jason Foss&#146;s Hidden Base Mains.<br>
Ok. This game i got a pretty good start. I got my objective flipped with a vigo, Presence, xizor, and the emperor at the Death Star docking bay. Jason pulled the home one docking bay and the tatooine docking bay. He dropped epp obi-wan and epp luke, and bron burs(i think, it was some alien) to the tat. Docking bay and my 3 droid hit squad came down with dengar with gun. I captured Obi-wan, hit bron, but missed luke. i played main course lost and jabba is through with you, and he lost luke and some force, i still had 1 attrition, so i forfited dengar to avoid his next turn beatdown. he deployed a bunch of characters to the Tat. docking bay and i&#146;m thinking &quot;what the @#$% is he doing&quot; and he tried to battle. I&#146;m like &quot;they&#146;re all droids&quot; and he&#146;s like &quot;@#$%!, im so tired i didnt notice&quot; so he has a han, leia, chewie(non protector) at the Docking bay. I deploy bane malar, zuckuss, djas, and boba fett to the docking bay. he&#146;s just like &quot;@#$%!&quot; he gets a on the edge off. and retrieves  4 with a stacked destiny, but ended up killing leia with a mis-tracked destiny. i battled, mind scanned han, he shot and killed djas, captured chewie, then canceled hans text, so he got no destiny, and i got 4..he lost han, and everything else.<br>
Result: FW 6(+64)<br>
Highlights: winning another game? a quick game, a high differential game.<br>
Lowlights: Beating someone who was so tired they didnt know they couldnt battle droids, even though i feel no pitty on him since I only got 1 hour of sleep.<br>
<br>
So we broke for lunch, and me, Jeff Cisz, Tony Vigliotti, and Mike alt all drove the 5 blocks to the Ghetto Burger king, and decided to eat in. On the way Tony was talking about Brad Kipple, he&#146;s like &quot;he&#146;s playing the same decks as you Josh&quot; and I&#146;m like &quot;yeah, i know. If i play his light, i win, if i play his dark, i lose&quot; So we get to Burger king, and we go inside to order food. The poor man that i am, i order a water, so they give me a cup and i go to the machine and fill it with soda...trick works everytime. So we&#146;re waiting for our food, and this guy walks in with a ski-cap on, which is weird in the heat of the summertime, and he keeps playing the drums with his hands, even though there are no drums, his hands are just waving all ofer the place. So even though I ordered first, I get my food last, and I go sit down. Mike calls me a scum bag for the soda trick, and he&#146;s right, it is pretty scummy, but who cares? I have a child, and every penny @#$%ing counts. So we&#146;re talking about how @#$%ed up people are in this place, and the drummer guy walks by us, and he has no food, just 4 Kids size soda&#146;s, so that was pretty weird. What a @#$%.<br>
<br>
We drive back to the tourney and i get ready for the games. I hear art say &quot;Brad Kippel is Dark against Josh Paterniti&quot; and I&#146;m just like &quot;what did we just @#$%ing talk about in the car?&quot; So I sat down and prepared for my beating.<br>
<br>
Game 4: Palace Raiders vs. Brad Kippels Agents<br>
Ok, we started this game, and i told him right away what we just talked about in the car, i knew he had me beat. He grabbed rendili, and moved xizor to the coruscant docking bay, then let me go. So I&#146;m looking at my hand, and it sucks. I got none of my pilots, my spaceport docking bay, battle plan, tatooine celebration, 2 palace raiders, a harvest, Houjix, and chewie of kashyyk. I deployed the docking bay, and drew up my first 4 cards, 2 harvest, 2 patrol craft. then i let him go. He activates and goes &quot;monnok lost&quot; and I go &quot;@#$%&quot; and lose 3 harvests, 2 patrol crafts, and 2 raiders. Talk about a turn 2 kill. So he gets emperor down to my cantina, snoova there, a vigo to the tat. Docking bay, and moves xizor there and flips.So i look at whats left in my hand, and draw a few cards. He drains for 4, i lose 2, he the ndeploys another vigo to the cantina this time, and boba fett to the docking bay, puts a card in used, looks at his force pile, looks at his destiny, tells me to go. So it went this way the whole game. I get my Owen &amp; Beru out with a raider/craft combo at the farm, and another combo at the spaceport docking bay, and han and chewie in the falcon, dash in the outrider to tatooine, flip and play harvest from lost to get my other 2 back, plus luke and tat. celebration. he drops bain, 4-lom, vigo, and IG to my spaceport docking bay, battles, i react.He draws a 5 and a 6, and i have 15 attrition, i lose it all and my objective flips back, he lost 4-lom. I got luke out, but his drains were still set up. he drained me for a total of 7 for 3 turns in a row, then deployed boba in slave 1 and stinger with guri to space, then came zuckuss in the mist hunter, with 4-lom, lateral damage on outrider, i draw 1 destiny, he draws 3. he drains on his next turn, i have 2 cards left, he puts 1 from his hand back to look, i draw up and he wins by 26.<br>
Result: FL 6(+38)<br>
Highlights:Losing to Brad, couldn&#146;t have been beat by a nicer guy.<br>

Game 5: Agents vs. Jonathan Yost&#146;s Old School EBO.<br>
I got a good start this game, got both docking bays, and got emperor to the north ridge. Flipped Second turn. He has like 5 systems out and EBO set up by turn 3, he deploys 1 x-wing to each system. Drains for 2 turns as i look for my ships, and he loses to my drains with Presence and vigo&#146;s and my objective. as he is losing, he loses a ice storm from deck, we both look at each other, then i look at the emperor, he says &quot;now if i only had one in my hand&quot;. I get Zuckuss in mist Hunter, Bossk in Hound, Guri, Stinger, First Strik, and Lateral Damage in my hand. he draws up and saves nothing. I drop them down, battle with first strike. draw 3 destiny&#146;s, 2 emperors and a 5, he try&#146;s to play ghhk, i point out first strike, he is like &quot;@#$%&quot;, his power 3 to mine of 33, he loses 30, next turn of my drains, game over.  <br>
Results: FW 8(+75)<br>
Highlights: Winning big.<br>
Lowlights: none<br>
<br>
At this point, I&#146;m in fourth place. Brian Twigg is in first and Tom Colarocco is in second with 1 timed win, both are undefeated. Brad Kippel is in third. The Pairings come up, Brian will play Brad, when I Play Tom.<br>
<br>
Game 6: Palace Raiders vs. Tom Colarocco&#146;s ISB Space.<br>
Tom was using a Brain Hunter-like ISB space deck, which he played pretty well, and added his own little bits and peieces like tie interceptors, dreaded fleet, and sfs tie cannons. He grabbed the Executor using Mob Points, and the Executor docking bay with Imperial Arrest Order. He had Piett in his opening hand, so he dropped him to the docking bay, searched for merjek, but didnt deploy him, he deployed endor from hand, and let me go. I got the Lars farm in my opening hand, and played tunnel vision to take owen &amp; beru. I dropped owen &amp; Beru, a palace raider and a craft at the lars farm, and a raider/craft combo at the docking bay, flipped my objective, and let him go. He got out kashyyk and fondor. Then used imperial Command to pull Chinerue, deployed him to the docking bay, drew a couple, and let me go. I drained him for 2, and he lost an outer rim scout. I played my tunnel vision from lost pile, and i had @#$% in my force pile, so i took the OOC/TT combo, and luckily got rid of the Outer rim Scout. I used the falcon to pull han and deploy them to the spaceport docking bay.i moved the palace riader combo there to the tat. docking bay, drew a couple, and let him go. He gets the executor out to fondor, deploys Sullust, moves his characters from the docking bay to the bridge, move to tatooine, and lets me go. I drain him yet again, for 3 this time. I get Melas and chewie to the cantina, and deploy wedge aboard the falcon. i let him go. H edrains me for 3, and i play a control combo from my hand. He then deploys dreaded fleet and den of theives, on the same turn. deploys a tie to tatooine with a sfs cannon on it, and a death squadrin destroyer there. He then deploys u-3po to the lars farm(why not the cantina, i am unsure) and lets me go. I drain him for 2,1,1 and he cancels a 2 and a 1 with the fleet and the den. I deploy battle plan,then let him go. He drains again and this time i play the control from the lost pile.  He then deploys ties and star destroyers to all 4 of the systems, and spreads out to drain. During my turn, i drew a few cards(after draining) and ended up with 2 harvests. I let him go. he drained an i played harvest, and then he deployed a outer rim scout from the den. he now had 2 of them out, not enough to flip his objective. I played harvest during my turn, drained, deployed dash in the outrider to the spaceport docking bay. drew, got a harvest, let him go, played my harvest after his drain. I retrieved 3 with a nar shadda wind chimes, he drew a bit, complained that he couldnt find a card he needed, and let me go. I drained him, deployed mirax in the skate, let him go, and so the game went for a while. He drained for ALOT, i drained for bits and retreived ALOT with harvest. He ran out of cards for the den and the Fleet, so my drains we&#146;re adding up here and there. After about though 10th time i played harvest he finally goes &quot;i got the card i needed&quot; next turn, he deploys &quot;something special planned for them.&quot; We are both running low on cards quick. He moved shuttled his characters down to the spaceport docking bay to block my drain, by this time i had a raider/craft combo there as well. so now my drains are a tad bit restricted, and im doing little damage compaired to him. he evens the game out quick, but battle plan slows him down near the end. i had like 8 cards left, and i drew 2, the second card i draw: Order to Engage. Big Pete is sitting behind me and sees me pull it, he just nodded at me, as if to say &quot;you got him now&quot; Tom then tries to shuttle characters to the cantina, but as soon as he does pete yells out &quot;you cant shuttle to an interior site&quot; tom gets mad because he feels it wasnt petes place to say anything. Pete is warned by the judge, and they clear the area around our game. The judge tells tom to go ahead and put them at the cantina, but tom has enough class to say &quot;i dont want to win like that&quot; and puts them to the tat. docking bay. I drain him, bring my ships up to tatooine, which now has a unpiloted executor, he runs. he drains me. He now lets me go. I drain him, and he now has 3 force left, compaired to my 5. I deploy order to engage, move my ships to 2 different systems. He drains me for 4 and i have 1 left, but there are now 5 sites he has to battle at, but only has 3 force left, and battle order isnt out, so he cant afford to pay for all 5. He battles me at the 2 systems and 1 site he can, and i survive them all due to dash reducing power, and mirax&#146;s forfit. He now has to lose 3 force for the order to engage, and i win by 1 card.<br>
Results: FW 10(+76)<br>
Highlights: Winning in a great game.<br>
Lowlights: None<br>
<br>
So it turns out that Pete has the same number of wins as me, but beats me out by 1 Differential, DAMNIT!!!! I had the tie break won as well, since i had a larger differential in a single game win. I kept thinking &quot;if i had just deployed 1 less effect, i would have gotten to the final against Brian&quot; but i guess thats just the way it goes sometimes.<br>
 Congrads to both Pete and Brian for Playing a great tourney.<br>
