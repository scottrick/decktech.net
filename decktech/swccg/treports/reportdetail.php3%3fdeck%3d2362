MWYHGL, WYGS, RTGP respectively.) After playing my buddy Tyng for a few weeks I thought I’d just play with decks I was comfortable with. As I was expecting a lot of WYGS and MKOGS to be there, I thought these decks would be a safe bet.<br>
<br>
My Dark: Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi<br>
Starting effects: Mob. Points, Crush the Rebellion and Imperial Arrest Order<br>
My Light: There Is Gay In Him<br>
Starting effects: Staging Areas, Strike Planning, and Insurrection<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourney Stuff<br>
<br>
I really don’t have anything to prove so I don’t need to waste your time with some @#% about how I ate brownies, or looked at a hot girl, or got drunk, or didn’t sleep at all the night before. I rocked up an hour early and met Tyng, we both were familiar with each other’s decks. We scrawled our decklists and played a few practice games. No surprises. People started turning up and we may as well have handed our decklists to them because despite several subtle and eventually unsubtle comments, they wouldn’t stop scoping our  decks. Rob Blandford, the tournament director, turned up, and we were slated to start at 10:30. I held my breathe and hoped not to play Tyng first round.<br>
<br>
Tourney Begins.<br>
<br>
Round 1 My Dark Vs. David Glass’ Dagobah Clouds<br>
<br>
I had talked to David earlier and found out that he to is returning to the game after quite a long hiatus. We had discussed some of the new stuff, reminisced about the good ol’ days and were glad to catch up again. But now fate had decided that we must forget the past and end it here. (Oooooh, melodramatic.) He started with just the Dagobah system and signalled for Wise Advice. I then hit myself on the head for not putting in a copy of CHYBC in this deck. His system allowed me to get a first turn Choke Vader w/ saber down to the Death Star: Docking Bay. The game then proceeded to it’s natural conclusion as after only a few turns I had Emp. Palpatine, Janus, Mara w/ saber at the Endor: Docking Bay and Tarkin alongside his ol’ pal Vader. Search &amp; Destroy and Visage then went to town on his deck. He lost various important cards from reserve such as 3 (Yes, three.) cloud sectors and both Encampments.  But he managed to set up two cloud sectors w/ Y-wings. No undercover spies came to visit but eventually he trained Son o’ Skywalker to Test 1 but it was too late. In the end he deployed Obi wan w/ Saber to Endor, who was swiftly &quot;You are beaten&quot;ed, then Disarmed then Circled when Vader moved there. I realised I had made a huge mistake the whole game now as he dropped an absolute monkey load (ie. a lot) of duplicate cards from hand. If only I had just pulled my Evader/Monnok and lost monnoked him earlier this game would have been a lot quicker. David then sat back in awe as the direct damage finished him, proving the true might of the Dark Lord.<br>
Full Win 2(+14)<br>
<br>
Round 2 My Light Vs. Tyng’s Hunt Down And Kick Luke’s Head In With 1st Turn Vader’s<br>
<br>
I thought my prayers had been answered. Tyng didn’t deploy a first turn Vader. I thought to myself, maybe if I finish this game early I could go purchase a copy of the Bible and then live my life through it’s spiritually fulfilling and practical contents, because obviously God did care about me. I activated my sweet 6 force *sigh* (better than 2.) and looked for the Home One: DB. It was now that God decided to punish me. I then began to weep openly, clenching my hands into tight fists, waving them in the air, crying &quot;Docking Bay’s! God, why have you forsaken me? Am I not one of your children too?&quot; Tyng didn’t want to verify (b/c he already knew my deck back to front) I drew some cards until the cursed DB dared reveal itself. In his next turn he responded to my DB withdrawal syndrome by deploying Vader to Endor: DB. *sob* (F#ck God.) I eventually deployed Madine to the Home One:DB and cancelled his Visage with the crack squad of Tawss and Blount. Tyng dropped CHYBC, and the crack squad began loitering around the Executor. A few turns later they were massacred at the Executor:DB by Dengar w/ Blaster, Vader (w/ Luke Captive), Dr. E+ Ponda Badass and a bunch of other mean looking b#stard’s. (But at least they were in the movies. I still get a chill whenever I see Operatives or those dodgy Rebel scouts. This means you, Cracken! Or should I say Chevy Chase!) The only highlight of the  game was that Gen. Crix was untouched the entire game allowing me to get some activation and churn out countless scout lamb’s for Tyng to slaughter. Trample. Choke. Dr. Evazan. Curse those damn ability 2 wienies. This game was just ugly. Just like Brooks Carlson. (Yes. That ugly.)<br>
Full Loss 2(-6)<br>
<br>
Round 3 My Dark Vs. Stephen Hartman’s There Is Good In Him<br>
<br>
Stephen’s deck had the same start as my light deck (except Squadron Assignments for Staging Area) and I knew its weakness. (Thanks Tyng!). I deployed the Executor:DB but with no opening hand Vader I drew cards. Yes! The freshly drawn Lord Vader in my hand appeared to wink at me &quot;Hey, I’m here for you buddy.&quot;. I appreciated his reassurance. During his turn Stephen made the first of several mistakes. He pulled Crix with Strike Planning, deployed him to Endor:DB then pulled Kensaric and deployed him with Crix. He then ended his turn. Huh?  I pointed out that Crix was not a scout therefore the Corporal’s gametext had no effect. Lord Vader was deployed and backed up his earlier statement by smacking the computer-generated ugliness out of Kensaric but his high forfeit meant Crix would remain. In Stephen’ next turn he activated 2 (Yes. 2) force and dropped the Endor system and gave Jedi Luke up to Vader. I deployed Vader’s lightsaber and Tarkin to the DB and beat that godawful haircut out of Crix for about twelve extra battle damage. Stephen activated and drew. I drained, deployed Mara w/ Saber. Stephen activated and drew. All the while Visage and drains were killing him. <br>
He eventually deployed Cracken and some random scout to the holotheatre, cancelling Visage. The next turn I twi’leked for Battle Order. I deployed it, along with Bossk in Bus and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to the Endor System. Stephen was not activating enough to do anything in this game. But just to be safe, the next turn I deployed Chimera and Guri to Endor. Late game, Stephen made desperate attempt to reclaim the Endor Landing Platform with…  wait for it…   Nien Nunb, Gen. Calrissian, Theron Nett and Wedge, Red Squadron Leader. Vader winked again. He battled me. After &quot;You Are Beaten&quot;ing Nien, Vader sliced General Cal. Mara diced Wedge. Tarkin gleefully jumped up and down and cancelled one of his battle destinies. Wedge cancelled mine. Theron Nett was forfeited. I forfeited Mara. Stephen lost some force from battle damage. When Nien came around he received the whaling of a lifetime by the Imperials who hated his ugly rubber mug, with enough battle damage to finish the game. Win by 26.<br>
Full Win 4(+20)<br>
<br>
Round 4 My Light Vs. Russell Chan’s Tatooine Troopers or something (?)<br>
<br>
Russell started with Jundland Wastes and &quot;Prepared Defence&quot;d for Secret Plans, Something Special Planned and Battle Order. As I was playing no retrieval, I thought about what must have happened to this poor guy to make so afraid of retrieval. Either way with his paltry 3 force first turn activation he deployed the generic Spaceport City from hand and Colonel Davon Jon. Huh? I pull Gen. Crix and Gen. Solo, activate 6, deploy Home One: DB from reserve, deploy Crix, pull Chewie o’ Whatever planet he’s from (Hint: It has like eleven y’s in it) and move Luke to the Endor: DB. Russell activates, doesn’t drain, but draws a few cards. I activate a sweet 11 force, pay for the Luke drain, pull Kensaric, end turn. Russell deploys Mos Eisley,and ends his turn. I activate, deploy Han w/ Heavy Blaster, Chewie O’ Home, Col. Kensaric and some random scout (Beezer, I think. Hmmmmm.) and initiate battle. I expect some kind of elaborate surprises but nothing happens. Davon Jon receives the beating that all people called &quot;Davon Jon&quot; deserve. Even I find this difficult to watch. He loses a load o’ force from reserve (including 2 Vaders) and it’s his turn. He deploys an undercover Arica to distract the Rebel Gentlemen’s Club from draining. Next turn I pay for Luke’s drain again, deploy Cracken and Double Agent Arica. The Rebel Gentlemen’s club moves over to Mos Eisley, ending my turn. Very little happened for the remainder of the game except I remember deploying Midge to the Chirpa’s Hut for the 3 drain with Luke. I drained a bit more for the game, Win by 37.<br>
Full Win 6(+57)<br>
<br>
Round 5 My Light Vs. Ryan Dare’s ISB<br>
<br>
Game in a nutshell. I saw the words &quot;ISB&quot;, some troopers, various docking bays, and just freaked. Marcus, a player I fear, plays a deck with ISB troopers that firmly instil the fear of God in me. After I see First Strike go down I deploy the Back Door, along with the entire Rebel Scout Crew. Don’t ask me why. All I could see the entire game was visions of me losing 759 force to a bunch of &quot;Dark Jedi Presence&quot;d, &quot;Trooper Assault&quot;ed troopers. He converts the Endor:DB making it difficult to leave the lush Endor forest surroundings, so abundant with fresh, green life, it only reminded more of the stale, black death that awaited any characters I deployed. He got around Cracken’s gametext by deploying all his characters in Chief Chirpa’s Hut. This drain of 2 became a drain of 6, due to Mara’s saber, Vader’s saber, ISB bonus and a presence (Battleground? Arrrggggh!) his ISB retrieval and drain reduction made Endor a lost cause and I started saving force to spread out to his docking bays. My lack of any worthwhile strategy, hell even thinking lost me this game. (Point to self. Play the game, if you lose, at least you tried. Don’t let any player psyche you out for a win.). Lost by 14<br>
Full Loss 6(+43)<br>
<br>
Round 6 My Dark Vs. Dave Geraghty’s Echo Base Experimental Frigate’s<br>
<br>
I’ve never played Dave before and I have no idea what to expect from him but all I know is that I would really love to win this game to go 4-2. If not for me, for the poor Hunt Down Objective that’ll be punished by the Tatooine expansion (Hell, the whole Dark Side.) I see Dave start with Main Generators and 4th Marker, and then signal for A New Secret Base. I wish I had put an Imperial Decree in but I guess Search &amp; Destroy will have to do. It takes us both a stupidly long time to get our decks started, with Visage stinging us both all the way. He told me later could have cancelled the Visage at any time in the early game but didn’t because I had a huge hand (due to the vast amount of drawing I had to do to get a Vader. But there are 5 goddammit!) and he deduced that I must have something to protect it. OK. Either way as I watched him lose force to the Visage I noticed some of the strangest  cards in his lost pile. Frigate’s (Yes. Frigate’s.) and Heavy Turbolaser Batteries (Yes. Them.) were in his deck.  What did this mean? What was happening? Was this some kind of Twilight Zone episode where Luke makes a good Hunt Down deck, goes away and when he returns is reviled because now everyone uses bad decks and that has become the new norm. Now Luke’s deck, that normally people would describe as &quot;beautiful&quot;, is actually &quot;ugly&quot; in this crazy new world. I thought that might be the case, but running around shrieking &quot;It’s all wrong! Don’t you understand? This is just not right!&quot; would probably get me kicked out of the tourney so I play on. Eventually I get Emp. Palpy to Endor: DB with Janus, Vader and saber to the Death Star: DB flip my objective and drop Search &amp; Destroy. He flips it back the next turn, deploying Commander Luke to the 4th Marker. Next turn Mara and saber cut Luke in half causing the reflip. He eventually got EBO out but his drains were slowed by the standard bounty hunter space fleet and Battle Order and I was able to inch out the win. Win for 13<br>
Full Win 8(+56)<br>
<br>
At the end of the day the top 5 are<br>
<br>
1. Clarrie Brown: The God™ of Chatswood Star Wars<br>
2. Matt: The Dog™ of Chatswood Star Wars<br>
3. Brett Chaiyawait: The <br>
4. Jared Brown: The Other God™ of Chatswood Star Wars<br>
5. Luke Bartter: The Luckiest B*stard™ of Chatswood Star Wars<br>
<br>
I didn’t see the final confrontation matches but bystanders had been anonymously quoted in saying &quot;Clarrie had Matt for breakfast.&quot; and &quot;Matt was simply molested out there.&quot; You can’t make stuff that sincere up. Either way I had an awesome day and can’t wait for the post-Tatooine tourney’s. (Even if pod-racing is the sucks the big one.) God I love this game.<br>
<br>
I have to put in special mention for Rob Blandford who ran an awesome tournament with a great turnout and even better prize support. After going to a Joseph Italiano Tourney (See Sealed Deck Reports &quot;Sydney, Australia 13/4/01&quot;) I was most certainly a refreshing experience.<br>
