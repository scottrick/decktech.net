<br>
Yahoo!  Another TR in Augusta and I couldn't be more excited.  I won Last weeks in some really close games if you feel like reading my other TR.  I barely got over Tony's HD Dueling by 6 force but with only 6 force, that means a couple mistakes can swing everything, so I barely got the win, but I had enough.  So I got 6 days in between the 2 tournaments to think about new decks.  For LS I want to run My Elom/Profit(read my last TR to find out what it is) even though it's completely expected.  I switch about 3 cards in it...taking out my Yarna D'Al Garna...  Anyways, For DS I am not sure.  My DS is never built by me RECENTLY.  So last week I played Yannick's deck and it ran strong.  This week I decide to go with BHBM Numbers kind of like David Aker's, but card choices and meta and stuff switched and swopped etc.  Since Art and everyone knows/Thinks I'll be running the same decks I stumble across this deck before the tourney and playtest it ONLY against myself so noone knows.  Anyway, I get a ride over to Book Exchange and do some trades.  I trade Boussh x2(got off ebay for $10) and 2 rares for Lord Vader and then trade Lord Vader and Foil Tarkin and a foil and some rares for a Luke Jedi Knight!!  So I now have more deck options!  ANYWAYS, ON TO THE TOURNAMENT!!!<br>
<br>
Game 1 My LS Eloms vs. ARG, Forgot the name which ticks me off cuz I remember sitting at the table staring at the command cards...:( he Had Unique Ties with ewapons<br>
<br>
Ahh, so Game 1 is here.  I start my stuff with Uh-Oh, Wise Advice, and Do Or Do Not.  He starts the forfeit=3 weapons card, squadron assignments for DS, and secret plans(PooP).  He then reveals his starting location...to reveal a DS Dagobah.  SO no offense to him, but I think this will be easy since he uses that system.  I get Tessek at the Audience Chamber.  He drops Endor with Fel/Saber 1 and another match-up Tie and for those of you who don't know, I run NO blue in my deck, why run it when I've won ALL drain races against ties?  Anyway, I signal for Baragaining table to handle that and drop Cantina with an elom, and put Massa at JP for free and mvoe him to cantina and flip retrieving none.  So he sees this, and drops CC Port Town District?  With an Emperor and Djas Puhr(Or Bane?) to there.  So I spend a turn gathering eloms in my hand and suck up the drain.  My turn I drain/damage for 4 and drop like 3 Eloms and EPP Leia against them.  He loses the guy and some.  His turn he drops another scrub 2/2 and loses 3 to OTE.  My turn, he's been drawing 3's and 4's all game.  And Tanus Spihjek let's my eloms die for 4 forfeit so I initiate against just the emperor with 2 eloms and EPP Leia.  He draws a 5, and I draw a 5(The only destiny I ever drew for BD this game).  I have to lose Leia(Profit Damage) or 2 eloms(Drain +1) so I just lose Leia since I can use chimes.  He drops some more systems, but I get the drain of 3 from the District, and 4 from cantina and it's not long bfore I win by 30 flat.<br>
<br>
Highs: Just moving fast and winning by 30<br>
Lows: He started Dagobah System for DS, not too good.<br>
The Ugly: Art plays a kid who learned the game a day before the tourney and wins by 51...<br>
<br>
Game 2: My BHBM #'s vs. Clay Cushman's TIGIH Falcon deck<br>
<br>
Well, he is basically playing Charlie Herren's Dagobah Regional winning LS Deck w/ Super Falcon and he starts Insurrection, Your Insight(Doh), and Squadron Assignments.  So I get an O.K. hand.  I drop Emperor to Endor DB first turn to hurt his activation, etc.  and put out Rednili and D*2DB and I draw for 1/4 Vaders but can't find one... So he activates 6 instead of 2 I think, because I am not TOO familiar with TIGIH and only keep him to 4 force forgetting it says no activation at Luke's SITE.  So he moves Luke to the Emperor and the two UR's are sittn' there all pretty :) Well, he Projections the Endor DB so I saerch my deck for CC DB(No Projections allowed) and put Prescence of the Force and finally get Lordy and drop him @ DS:2 DB and move them both to converge on the CC DB.  His turn, he signals in activation for a Projection(the one I cancelled, Wise Advice) and tries to put it on the CC DB.  I remind him it ain't no Planet Site!  So he changes his mind, and drops EPP Obi to the site but he gets barriered.  So I have a big hand and he plays a Used grimtaash and I sense, he grabs and does nothing.  The draw for the sense is... a 3,720-1...So no @#$%s his head back all suprised and Your Insight never leaves the table the rest of the game.  I cancel Grimtash and start my turn kind of ticked.  I See Obi there and decide it's time to get a stack.  I drop none and initiate he hacks at Vader but misses via Kessel, and I draw medium and he drawed medium, Obi covers it perfectly and goes to a Bacta Tank while he stacks and I have no attrition, and after drawing enough for a SA War I alter the tank.  And i get it with no opposition.  He goes and draws.  My turn I payed 3 to drain and dropped(RISKY) Draednaught and Bossk In HT to rendilli to satisfy Battle Plan.  His turn, He drops Falcon/Captain/Leai EPP and I barrier of course.  So, I drop Fett in SLave 1(Barried) Lateral Damage to Coruscant, and Zuckuss in Ship.  I KNOW he's got Adders, so don't think I am unaware of Charlie's deck.  I initiate and sure enough he Punches me in the face with with 5 destinies.  He draws kinda low and gets 15 for BD.  I draw a 7 for BD via 2 destinies.  So he loses Captain and Stacks while I lose the Nought, Zin MH, B IN HT(Another in hand).  And Fettin Slave is left against EPP Leai in falcon.  I really hope he doesn't intiate!! He drops REd Squad 1 with...Old school Wedge?  and moves both to Coruscant to wipe off Lat Damage.  My turn, I drain and save force.  He comes back and draws.  My turn, I lat damage Wedge(Power 6) to Endor and put B in HT at endor and Executor(new) at rendiolii.  I initiate and he is kinda pooped that I run 2 damages and 2 B in HT, but all I can say is... IT works.  So I get another card stacked.  He drops EPP Obi in for another run, but His suicide runs get wazzooed by Barrier. And I have 5 cards stacked, but it's too late to turn him so I drain him instead.  He has an empty Red Squad 1(lat Dam) at rendilli and puts Captain in it.  he initiates and draws 4 and stacks.  My turn I drain him out.  I win by 18.  BUT HMM, I am SO STUPID I don't notice Captain can't drop in it AND he has no destiny it in.  It didn't matter though, a great game.<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning Every battle(I think) and having 7 ships worked.  I am glad I dropped Nouhgt #3 for B in HT #2.  <br>
Lows: He just had a bad game, and never got a single drain off, sorry Clay.<br>
The Ugly: 5 destinies... I still have bad dreams at night...<br>
<br>
Game 3: My DS Numbers vs. Arthur Rhodes Harvest<br>
<br>
YAY, I get to play Art.   Lots o fun!  He knows I am running inserts... He starts Obi's Hutt/Careful Planning for Lar's Farm.  well, the night before I was drunk, and dropped my Grabber for a dreadnaught... So here we go.  I get emperor, and don't know where to put him...Farm or DS2:DB??  I decide DB for activation.  I want to use Emperor's Power also and don't want to lose my only emperor in a battle since I'll need him for numbers.  His turn he drops 2 2/0s...BAD...And draws all.  My turn, I drop Tech Mor and insert :) His turn, He activates and it's not found.  Well, if i Summarize turn for turn this will take forever.  So basically, he activates7/12 and the insert comes up, and he it coould be worse's for 7/12 of the damage.  I drain 3 at endor and 2 at renduilli thanks to 2 P of the Forces.  And insert as much as possible.  One turn though, He is activating, And i need to choose whether to Rise Vader into hand to keep odds HIGH or keep him down, turns out, I rise him.  He activates every card over and I had forgotten to INSERT!!! I played like a true SCHMUCK this game.  He Harvests, I sense about 2, and Lord get's to the Hutt.  Anyways, It comes down to me snesing his last harvest and winning by 2.  <br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning against Art for the first time to move into first place.<br>
Lows: Winning by 2 force, having people say &quot;You Only beat him by 2 FORCE THOUGH!!!&quot; Had I played like a skilled person, and not made so many mistakes/HAD MY GRABBER it woulda been 20.<br>
The Ugly: Taking my Grabber out...I start Oppressive and took out my only grabber.  He had over 5 harvests... I am an idiot<br>
<br>
Game 4: Art's Brangus Glee deck vs. Ls Eloms<br>
<br>
Ugh, this should be hard, he knows my deck completely.  But the weird thing is, nigth before the tourney, I get on DT and see Bastian posts this wierd Brangus deck using Put All Seciotns on Alert.  So I know the idea... And Signal for ym grabber first turn.  I get Tessek down.  I have a massive hand, he draws LIKE MAD for Monnok and plays it, I lose 2 Bens, 2 YWTMTJabba Now, and 6 eloms.  I've NEVER had a hand size that big, but all my unique aliens and Take me to Jabba Nows had gotten together in my reserve and I had no hope unless I drew them.  I he continues Monnoking and I ask him how many he has only becuz I am not watching him to see what he swops the DS DBs for.  I lose a total of 19 cards to his one monnok over the course of the game.  He initiates against my Massa at the end, I have 3 damage.. And put Massa in Lost pile, but decide to take the 3 and lose, but he won't let me take it back.  Ugh, I have 1 card left and he broken concentrations it and uses Barquin Dan every turn to retrieve his whole lost pile.  At least 10+ in his lost pile.  So I lose by 39 cuz of it, and he is very content.<br>
<br>
Highs: none...<br>
Lows: I am not sure but try reading the above paragraph.<br>
The Ugly: Taking out Yarna...@#$% 19 CARDS!<br>
<br>
WEell then... time for game 5 in the back... Fredrick(one of the younger ones) is talking to Clay about how happy he is that he's 3-1 and that's AWESOME!  Litlerally, but then I end up paired against him...<br>
<br>
Game 5 My LS Eloms vs. Freddricks Court BH Weapons too<br>
<br>
So there isn't much to say.  I drop Chirpa's hutt and he goes.  I drop cantina and some stuff.  He drops Garindan the spy and EPP Fett to Chirpas Hutt.  My turn, I drop HOT Jedi and pass.  His turn, he drops some aliens, and basically I am gonna make this short.  Aliens like Djas and Dr E by himself are usless matched against Mass and Ben... So I easily play safe and keep as many cards in the deck as possible.  He has 3 cards left and has Evazan.  I am like, &quot;You move him to the cantina or you'll lose thru drains, or draw up&quot;  And he says in respone &quot;I Never give up&quot;.  I am thinking, WOW, what a cool kid(I shouldn't say kid cponsidering he's only 2 or so years younger) so he moves evazan in front of Han and Ben.  I am amazed at this guy.  Anyway, I win by iontitiating.  And I count to find I've won by 37.<br>
<br>
Highs: HMM, let's take a Look at a card that's needs to be errated called HONOR OF THE JEDI.  I SLAP that baby down, stop his drain of 2 at the hutt, his 1 court damage, AND First STRIKE!!!  all i can say is: broken<br>
Lows: I hate winnning due to the fact of having more cards than another player.<br>
The Ugly: having to beat him by 37 whne I new he was excited about how good he was doing.  <br>
<br>
Game 6 My DS Numbers vs. Carmine's &quot;Tests are important but disrupting your game plan is more important&quot; Arca's MWYHL<br>
<br>
So I'll go ahead and write a paragraph about the first 5 minutes of the game just cuz it pissed me off 'Greatly'.  So We shuffle/Cut/and draw hands.  James(Our incredible TD!) runs up and says CARMINE, here's a card your opponent had in his deck and it's yours.  So carmine takes the card and shoves it in his deck.  Meanwhile, Carmine's like, &quot;Ok, I gotta redraw cuz it coulda been in my hand&quot;.  The correct ruling should be the card is placed out of play(In his bookbag) since it's his fault he doesn't count his deck after games, OR bfore the game started!!  So I respond, &quot;YOU can't redraw your hand!  Be Glad I am even letting you use that one card, and start to call James over&quot;  He's like &quot;Don't get James&quot; and before I can get James(TD) over, Carmine throws his hand BACK into his deck.  I BARELY am controlling my temper now.  I am like: &quot;WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?  GO BACK THROUGH and get your hadn back out&quot;  And he's like: &quot;I barely even remember my hand Paul!&quot;  RRRiiiggghhhttt...I put up with this BS and 2 days later, talk to Brandon(my friend) who was watching the whole thing, ONLY to have Brandon tell me Daughter of Skywalker was in Carmine's starting hand                <br>
<br>
                     you do the math<br>
<br>
<br>
So we start off with me being really pissed.  Hmm, I shoulda shoved my hand back in too... So I get an OK draw.  He knows I got Inserts(Watch me play Art) and so he starts Insight and never loses it(this only adds on to the anger).  And He says at some point that I can't do jack cuz he'll never lose Insight and &quot;I own you!!&quot;  So My 2nd turn, I kindda say drian of 1 at CC DB with emperor but interrupt with monnok, but he loses his double signal and monnok nets nothing but I still see his hand, And I try to take my drain back bfore I play monnok, since he hasn't lost anytrhing.  But he accuses me of cheating, WHAT THE HECK???  And keeps me to it.  So I drop Endor with a dreadnaught and Prescene OTF with 2 barriers in hand.  His turn... Of all THINGs he could possibly do, he puts out Tibrin :) My turn I drop another prescence OTF and Dreadnaught there for ANOTHER drain of 3. And put Lord at the CC DB.  I have mucho drains now and he puts out hot jedi.  So he puts cantina with Premeire Obi and Sitck and Proficiency and... 2-1B foil...?  Hmm, He has 2 in his deck which makes me want to..., oh nevermind, he likes the card I guess.  So I rise my friend Lord and redeploy Vader and kill Obi.&quot;Get Out of this HIZZ-OUSE&quot;-BrandonCheek.He worries about me and not testing.  I'll just put the rest of the game in highs/lows/uglies.<br>
<br>
Highs: Having him drop Tibrin giving me a drain of 3... :)<br>
Lows: I'll skim some mistakes he made, he hacks at Vader, draws a 4  and 2 and forgets to subtract one via Insight.  He forgets cancelling Drain +1 on tibrin via test 1.  He drops tibrin.  The whole 1st paragraph dilema...<br>
The Ugly: HMMMMMM, let's think children... He never force drained me, he never won a battle against me, He never completed test 2, and still hasn't beaten me in sw yet.   Don't go yell at brandon just cuz he told me DOS was in your hand.<br>
<br>
Noone think I am trying to diss Carmine in anyway behind his back, I know he's on DT and he'll end up reading this, so there is nothing between us and we are cool.<br>
<br>
SO Art edged me by a good bit in Diff and I take 2nd.  on to Props/Slops  <br>
<br>
Props: James for turning out to be an AWESOME TD and raking in awesome Support, I got a reflections pack and a DS:2 pack and a CC pack!!<br>
Clay and Art for some really good games!<br>
Art for having no insert protection ;) J/k art<br>
Umm, who else... oh YAH, to JIM for playing Rescue the Pr.<br>
-&quot;Don't LAUGH&quot;-JimBoyd<br>
Major SUPER PROPS go to Clay for being a great sport when he loses to a punk kid ;) and  Chris Mirva for trading me a much needed Luke Sky., JK!! and the JK is not for just kidding.<br>
<br>
<br>
Slops: All the guys in Augusta who missed yet another great Tourney, Landon, we miss you ;) he's a funny guy, and Tony-I missed your solid competitiiion too!<br>
Art for Locking me in game 4 and retrieving entire lost pile and just making me sit there...<br>
Me for removing DS Grabber and Yarna costing me against Art.  <br>
<br>
Well It was a great Tournament!  I am Glad I went and thanks for reading/reviewing this fellow DT MEMBERS!<br>
