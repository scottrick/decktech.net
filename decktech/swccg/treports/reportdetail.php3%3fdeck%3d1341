<br>
<br>
The following contains a brief synopses of each game I played over the 1st 2 days of DecipherCon, and a couple more HIGHLY important props I missed from my first pseudo report.<br>
<br>
BTW, I was playing an old school throne room mains w/ enough SAC to take on anything but my dark deck, AKA Matt Sokol’s ‘BEAST’… and incase you don’t know how the story goes, I was kinda ‘preoccupied’ till about 7am of Day 2.  When I finally did get to bed (the floor) I set the alarm for 8am, but apparently I set it for 8PM!  So 9:30 roles around and we are all still asleep till Steve Baroni and Steve Brentson wake us up.  Hence, the reason Kyle Craft and I played essentially the same decks both days.<br>
<br>
DAY 1<br>
<br>
GAME 1 - LIGHT VS some guy’s BHBM w/ TONS of SAC from AZ<br>
I’m sorry but I had a really hard time w/ peoples names from Day 1… it was a very, very long weekend (drinky-drinky motion).  Basically, everything I played was Sensed or Altered.  Everything.  Like I’d play an OOC and it’d get sensed- or I’d play Careful planning and it’d get sensed.  So I used this to my advantage.  I’d save up a lot of crap interrupts, some essential, some useless, for the guy to sense, and I’d deplete whatever stock pile of SAC he had in his hand so I could come in an play a clash or an ‘I know’ for a decisive battle.  I was activating lots (as is the trademark of my TRM, as Tim Guzman will attest to) and I was able to track my Artoo in Red 5… that game I sliced the emperor twice, Vader two or 3 times, and then he lost a couple Vaders due to battle damage.  Then, after all 5 Vaders had been lost I managed to place one OOP.  I think we all know how well BHBM runs w/o any Vaders.  FW + 10<br>
2 (+10)<br>
<br>
GAME 2 - DARK VS some guy’s MYWHL w/ AFAs and Super Falcon from VA<br>
MWYHL is a pain for my deck to play because of the +4 to the S/A draws.  It just makes things go so much slower.  Anyway I lost 0 damage from him the entire game, as far as battle damage and force drains were concerned.  He did hit me w/ a bunch of AFAs and my objective was taking its toll on me, though.  I was able to satisfy honor with the infamous combo going on the Falcon at Carida (1) (which is parsec 1- so he needed a few maneuvers just to escape to Kessel) and a presence of the force on the throne room (2) and Mara holding down the CC docking bay (3).  So between drains, MAIH, and dueling, I pulled the win off.  FW + 17, I think<br>
4 (+27)<br>
<br>
GAME 3 - DARK VS a kid’s crummy HBX non flip thing from CA<br>
This kid was small.  I am tall.  By default I win this match up.  Anyway he was totally and utterly unprepared for the beast.  I get Luke, I start dueling, I start draining, and the combo comes up quickly.  I win.  FW + teens<br>
6 (+40something)<br>
<br>
GAME 4 – LIGHT VS some guy’s ROPS<br>
I don’t care what you say a good player with a TRM deck should beat a standard ROPS deck by a minimum of 20 every single time.  If you don’t know how this match up goes then you’re playing the wrong game.  FW + 20 something<br>
8 (+60 or 70 something)<br>
<br>
GAME 5 – LIGHT VS WALTER COWART’S ROPS<br>
See above.  FW + 26<br>
10 (+90 something)<br>
<br>
GAME 6 – DARK VS DOMINIC GAURDAEULT’S EBO from QUEBEC!<br>
This was a tight game.  EBO is a huge weakness for the beast because it gives them locations I can’t follow them at (thus they escape the 4 MAIH damage) and they can cancel ROC.  Fortunately, as was the case in all my games vs. EBO no one was expecting ROC, so they put the war room as the innermost site.  Well this game gets off to a slow start.  I swear cause I draw force lightning AND Carida in my opening hand (fortunately no emperor… this time)… I show the Carida to Dom and he’s like, “well at least you can get the executor.”  Yes!  That’s right!  I can still get my Exe… FU.CK!  The Flagship Executor is ALSO in may hand!  3 dead slots!  Just what I need!  The whole time before the game I knew I was going to be playing him, so I was like, yeah a 5-0 run was nice while it lasted… then while I was shuffling Brian Twigg comes up and like throws his decks at my head!  It hurt!  But I guess it was good luck or something… I dun… I deployed Vader to the 4th marker, and then Mara, then Tarkin, then Cabbel, I was planning an invasion (to bad I took decree out!)  I was able to establish the ROC/MAIH combo on his falcon and keep his drains to a minimum.  I was also losing lots of force to Do or Do not cause he kept playing the same On the Edge and Surprise Assault on me, but I had a lot of Senses &#61514; result: FW + 8<br>
12 (+90 something)<br>
<br>
GAME 7 – DARK VS PETER DI BASIO’S EBO<br>
This time I was psyched!  I thought I could beat it!  Too bad he wasn’t playing any characters for my lovely combo.  He used the ‘deploy Luke from lost pile’ text exquisitely.  He had a good mix of speeders and x wings that just absolutely raped me.  Matt had said it, and I had known it to be true- swarm kills the beast.  And don’t think I don’t play Monnok!  He had a hand of like 15 and all I got was 2 snow speeders!  I was like WTF?  Peter is the MAN.  He had my number that weekend (we played in the JPSD on Day 3 and he was the only one to beat me- keeping me from the final) and he played extremely well.  Congrats on 8-0 day one, Peter.  FL – 26<br>
12 (+70 something)<br>
<br>
GAME 8 – LOVELY LIGHT VS ERIK MARKARIAN’S BHBM from MA<br>
Great!  I fly to Florida from Massachusetts to play a guy I already play every month!  Unfortunately I could replace the word ‘play’ from the previous sentence w/ the word ‘beat’ and this game was no exception.  It always amuses me how every single game we play has ‘got to be the stupidest game [Erik’s] ever played.’  I swear every single game he says that… and again, this game was no exception.  I deploy lot’s of Twix’s and goo nee Tay and revo (note to all of you out there- DO NOT REVO THE D*II DB WHILE THE EMPEROR IS THERE! It may seem like fun and games at first, but honor doesn’t do @#$%.  The E makes it a battleground.  Go figure.) And he tries to combat that… the whole way I have Leia w/ her dad’s saber draining somewhere.  The game goes by quickly.  It was a nice conclusion for the day for me.  FW + 23?<br>
14 (+90 something)<br>
<br>
YAY!  3rd place!  Not only that- but 2 of my fellow Kashyyykians also made it to Day 2!  Kashyyyk doesn’t suck after all!<br>
<br>
Well, it’s like 3am now, and need a new dark deck I’ve decided.  I sit down to talk tech w/ the Twiggs and Matt, among others, and I think you know the rest… <br>
<br>
 DAY 2<br>
<br>
GAME 1 – DARK VS STEVEN TURNER’S TRM W/O SAC from TN<br>
Hayes need sleep.  Hayes unable to eat.  He buys @#$%ty cinnamon roll for 2.50 and can only eat like 2 tiny bites so Matt eats the rest… I draw in my opening hand the Emperor.  Okay, that sucks, I say to myself, I’ll just wait a turn to deploy him.  No, not this time.  Steve decides to deploy 3 Twix’s.  Fu.ck.  But the beast can handle it.  I activate, I deploy my DB, and I save.  He goes, he signals, he deploys goo nee Tay.  Fu.ck.  Of course this is the one game out of 8 that I play where I don’t get a minimum of 3 Vaders in my opening hand.  (Seriously in all the games I played I got 3 lords, and vs. Dom I even got my DV w/ stick)  I tried to make a come back, but I wasted the combo on Obi-wan, I think, instead of waiting to put it on a big drain (like the one that he created at Kessel several turns later).  Oh yeah, in the beginning of this game while counting each other’s cards I noticed that a card was severely miscut- like way down to one side.  So I asked for it to be replaced.  I think Steve took offense cause then he went through my deck and meticulously checked every single card!  Anyway Juz agreed w/ me, and goes off w/ an Orrimaarko asking for a home one…yeah… way to reveal not just one card of his deck to me, but 2 cards to every single person in the whole room!  He gets his home one and I get my sense replaced and we played… later he even signed my sense ‘this card is marked’ and he put a little smiley face on it… a little smiley face that was IDENTICAL to the one that Heidi Farinholt put on the EPP Liea she signed!  There you have it folks- hard evidence they WERE having sex at DCon: - )  so Steve and I are cool now- hew was an excellent opponent.  FL – 17<br>
0 (-17)<br>
<br>
GAME 2 – LIGHT VS MARTIN FALKE’S BLITZKRIEG TOSCHENRUCHNER<br>
Wow… my computer actually accepted the title of his deck as real words… for those of you who don’t know, the ‘blitzkrieg toschenruchner’ is Martin and Bastian’s trooper ROPS version.  Originally titled ‘blitzkrieg,’ meaning something along the lines of ‘fast attack,’ the one German word I knew, ‘toschenruchner,’ meaning ‘calculator’ some how was added on… If I remember how exactly, I’d tell you.  There might be something about it on an older code though, I’m unsure.  Basically Martin out played me, and that doesn’t happen often, I can assure you.  Seriously I thought I owned his @#$% (it was ROPS after all).  I activate my 5, deploy Rpoint and a Nudj from hand, then a Nudj from the deck and I see I have a revo AND a signal in my force pile.  I get the revo.  I revo his Ralltiir.  He is choked.  The cap’n finds his way to the system in his ship and then Luke and obi start wandering around the spaceport.  Okay I control 3 ralltiir locations and he controls 1.  I am activating 21 to his 12.  He just out played me.  I didn’t take advantage of my activation enough and I had some crap destiny draws.  I had Savrip out and he had 1st strike… so he’d initiate and I’d lose one, he’d retrieve one, and then I’d have to Savrip something to keep my main character on the table… W/ like 30 seconds left I had 5 cards and he had 8, but he had reflipped so I just drew up.  Good game, Martin.  FL –8<br>
0 (-25)<br>
<br>
GAME 3 – DARK VS DANIEL AMOR’s CC MAINS (I think)<br>
The beast rules.  I set up the combo mad fast and had some really good drains early.  SAC rules.  FW + 26<br>
2 (+1)<br>
<br>
GAME 4 – LIGHT VS ZACH STENERSON’S ROPS<br>
Hee hee TRM kills ROPS!  There was one notable battle though… he had DVDLOTS at the forest.  I had just deployed OTE and moved obi over to where Han and Orrimaarko where in front of him.  We were about 35 minutes into the game and he had lost about 6-7 cards and I had lost 0.  He deploys Mara, Tarkin, tempest scout 5 w/ a pilot and battles.  I play I Know.  Liea joins the party w/ anakins stick.  He swings w/ Vader and misses.  I clash Vader.  He swings w/ Mara and misses.  I hit Tarkin, and Mara, then draw some nice destiny.  He loses 2 and then everything (except for Vader, who I shoulda hit AND then clashed) and I lose orri.  Game.  FW + 25<br>
4 (+26)<br>
<br>
GAME 5- DARK VS MARTIN LOGGHE’S MYWHL CC RETRIEVAL<br>
WTF?  MWYHL AND DO OR DO NOT… I knew I shoulda changed the beast… well I start dueling Luke despite his exceptional destiny, and I win most of the time thanks to some mad tacking on my part and Sim Aloo.  While I wasn’t dueling I was trying frantically to keep a 1 or 2 on the top of my reserve deck to sense his numerous on the edges and path of least resistances.  Path sucks.  I put @#$%ing sarkli out in front of responsible obi, then he starts dropping characters to that site and I’m like, wtf? Then the paths start coming… man I am glad I was packing 7 sense… after a couple canceled AFAs (I put in projective telepathy) and all that do not damage I come out ahead.  FW + 4<br>
6 (+30)<br>
<br>
GAME 6 – LIGHT VS TIM GUZMAN’S BHBM<br>
This is pretty much like me and Steven’s game (game 1) except my TRM deck is actually good :- )  I just get twix’s and goo nee tay and I beat up on the emperor and vader a lot.  not so much dicing though… FW + 24<br>
8 (+54)<br>
<br>
GAME 7 – MAARTEN SCHUMACHER’S ROPS (I think)<br>
I apologize if this wasn’t what you were playing… I don’t really remember all my games too well… all I know is that I won.  FW + ??<br>
10 (+70 something)<br>
<br>
GAME 8 – PAUL TODD FELDMAN’S BRANGUS SUPERSTAR @#$%<br>
It had been a long day.  You have to understand that Kyle and I were playing very similar light decks, and that Kyle had already beaten Paul’s deck by 20 or so earlier.  So Paul was not looking forward to this game.  Anyway, whoever wins this game goes to day 3 since we were both 5-2 and didn’t have the greatest differentials.  For some reason this didn’t sink in too much, for me at least.  I dunno.  We’re playing and I’m using my superior activation and honor or the jedi to abuse his first strike at his docking bay…  basically he managed to kick me off the docking bay, but he had devoted a lot of forces to doing so.  Then we had a big battle in space- I had the falcon w/ Melas and Cap’n han piloting vs a bunch of his ships- liea is a pasanger.  He battles I play I know I wipe everything but zuckuss in MH.  I then forget to move liea into the pilot seat, not once but twice!  So he kills her w/ attrit.  As clint pointed out so candidly, he played a gravity shadow which I failed to sense by drawing a jedi luke, but he put the shadow in his used pile.  So there we are- 10 minutes past time due to arguing, he has 19 cards, I have 18, and a jedi luke in my reserve deck (which is 4 cards).  All I have to do is activate him and deploy him and wipe out zuckuss and then the falcon is free to roam space unopposed.  Time runs out.  I suck.  There were a lot of things I coulda done differently that game but my energy was low and Paul is a strong player.  TL –19<br>
10 (+50 something)<br>
<br>
I finish 15th, which isn’t bad people tell me- but I know I coulda done better.<br>
<br>
PROPS!!!!!!!!<br>
Steve Baroni- for being a damned cool kid to hang out with.  You gotta get over to my house so we can playtest the JPSD<br>
Michael Hawley- that’s right… decktech’s own ‘rayc’ I dunno how I missed this guy- he’s another kashyyykian (there were like 15 of us there!)… to bad we didn’t get to hang out more in FL, mike<br>
Doug Faust- I apologize Doug, I seriously couldn’t remember the 5th member of our breakfast club on Sunday, but whatever. Thanks for letting me borrow your pencil and great TR.<br>
To all you guys who gave me props in your TR: alex tennet, tim guzman, george gundry (sorry man I’m not going to do the list), matt sokol, and everyone else- my brain is fried!<br>
<br>
SLOPS!!!!!!<br>
ME!!!- for scrubbing out!  And for snoring (apparently)!! And forgetting the guys above in my original PROPS list!!<br>
<br>
I’ll be retiring my ‘borrowed’ decktech privileges now, until the next major event- but until then know that you guys are the greatest- Dcon was a major trip and I really enjoyed hanging out with you all!<br>
