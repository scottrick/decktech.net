point.  So of course I do not have my own game by game details.  Of course this still helps<br>
all of us to see what is out there in the playing field.<br>
<br>
So who is the Nevada State Champ for the Year 2000?  Well that comes later in the<br>
report.  We had a disappointing 18 people show up for this event. Some of my younger<br>
ones’ parents thought it was to long of a day and 2 others had SAT’s.  Strange how it<br>
worked out, because I know of at least 5 more that wanted to come and didn’t show up. <br>
Anyway I did have all of Nevada’s Top People playing in this tournament(except me :))<br>
So I knew it was going to be good.<br>
<br>
The main contenders were Kris Lavigne, Dan Christy, Brandon Gravo, Chris Hines, and<br>
Matt Berta.  All of them were good players and any one of them could have done it. <br>
Travis Merkle(my padawan), John Spadora, and Jeff Lavigne were also expected to have a<br>
good showing.<br>
<br>
We decided, before the Tournament began that we were going to have a final<br>
confrontation.  With a Tournament as important as a State Championship we(me and ALL<br>
of my players) felt that a Final Confrontation would be the proper way to say who is the<br>
Champion of the State for that year.<br>
<br>
I seen a lot of different Deck types at this tournament. Here is a break down of the<br>
different decks that were played.<br>
<br>
Darkside:<br>
Hunt Down with dueling x3<br>
Hunt Down with faking the duel x2 (One was played in final)<br>
Ralltiir Ops x5<br>
ISB x2<br>
Court of Vile x1 (was played in final)<br>
Corulag Ops with numbers x1<br>
Death Star start x1 (Tree Leaf v1.2 played by the Droidpimp)<br>
Tatooine mains x1<br>
Tie Swarm x1<br>
60 random cards x1<br>
<br>
Lightside:<br>
Yavin 4 with major revo’s x1<br>
Yavin 4 with mains and choke..maybe only 3 revo x2<br>
Obi-Hut start with Careplanning x3 (one of them is the Mark Hamill deck played by<br>
SkuffD)<br>
Hidden Base with Beatdown x1<br>
Hidden Base otherwise x2<br>
MWYHL no Test with mains x1<br>
MWYHL test to 5 x1<br>
MWYHL the Falcon Deck x1 (was played in final)<br>
Profit deck x1<br>
Profit deck with numbers x1<br>
Ralltiir Ops Lightside x1<br>
Cloud City mains x1<br>
Yoda hut start with Choke x1 (was played in final)<br>
60 random cards x1<br>
<br>
Not bad for a good amount of decks played.  It was also interesting to note that the Top 2<br>
people were not playing Rallops or Yavin 4 mains.  Here is a brief summary of the match<br>
ups and how some people were knocked down.<br>
<br>
Game 1 match ups put Matt berta up against Chris Hood, both have a tendency to time<br>
out..so guess what happen they Timed out with Chris Hood ahead.  Although this would<br>
be Matt's only lost until the final. Brandon Gravo was put up against Noah Singer and<br>
Brandon had nothing going good for him this game, he loses. Chris Hines is up against a<br>
Newbie...easy win. Travis Merkle and John Spadora match and Travis comes out ahead.<br>
Kris Lavigne and Danny Rider(up and coming) face off with Kris taking the victory. Read<br>
on.<br>
<br>
Game 2 match ups during this game Matt takes his winning streak taking down Brandon<br>
Gravo.  Gravo is a little down since he is now 0-2.  Kris beats Noah to avenge Brandon<br>
and Hines Takes out Garrett.  Two games go by and everything looks like a normal<br>
tournament with the usual people winning.  Let’s move on.<br>
<br>
Game 3 has 4 undefeated players that have to play each other.  With Chris Hines going<br>
against Dan Christy. And Travis Merkle facing off vs Kris Lavigne. Chris Hines’ Dark Ops<br>
on Corulag was having problems with Dan’s Mains and other’s.  Chris wasn’t seeing any<br>
of his ops and wasn’t able to flip for about 6 to 7 turns and when Dan show’s up with a<br>
Disrupter Pistol things don’t look to good, Dan wins by 25. In Travis’ game Kris seem to<br>
be in control for most of the game.  Travis was having trouble getting Ralltiir to flip.  Kris<br>
was using a lot of his stuff to keep it unflipped and didn’t go to space for a while(Kris was<br>
doing HB).  Well after Travis finally killed all of Kris’ resources he flip and the game was<br>
close but Travis wins by 10.<br>
<br>
Game 4 now has only 2 undefeated players and they both have to face off.  Dan Christy<br>
plays No Order In the Court(my deck that is posted here) and Travis is playing Hidden<br>
Base.  Dan doesn’t seem worried because he beat a Hidden base earlier today.  Travis is<br>
having a hard time most of the game.  Dan at one time Monnok like 5 x-wings out of his<br>
hand.  Travis still had more, which was Dan downfall.  Dan thinking that Travis was out of<br>
resources spread to thin.  Travis took advantage of the situation for a beatdown which<br>
took Dan for about 10 cards.  Dan was having trouble retrieving since Aim High was out,<br>
but he did the best he could.  He knows now what mistakes he made and says he wants to<br>
put in Search and Destroy(good call), in was close and fun to watch.  Travis wins by 7.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile all those expected to win wins.  It looks like this Travis Merkle 4-0, Dan<br>
Christy 3-1, Matt Berta 3-1, Chris Hines 3-1, Kris Lavigne 3-1, and Brandon Gravo 2-2.<br>
<br>
Game 5 is a tough round for the players.  Dan Christy gets revenge on Travis winning by<br>
18. And Matt Berta playing Hunt Down gets his Revenge on Chris Hood winning by 9.<br>
Kris Lavigne and Chris Hines had to face off and Kris Lavigne gets hit with numbers and<br>
Chris Hines finds his Ops and flips easy with a victory of 31.  Let’s us go to the next<br>
round.<br>
<br>
Game 6 match ups put some interesting people together.  First Place would go to the<br>
person who wins the top table game.  Which was between Dan Christy and Chris Hines. <br>
Second place looks like it would go to either of the next 4 people which were Travis<br>
Merkle if he wins against Jeff.  And either Kris Lavigne or Matt Berta.  Brandon Gravo<br>
had a chance also, but he would have to count on Matt Berta to lose against Kris. <br>
Anyway Chris Hines was Playing Yavin 4 Major Choke with like 5-7 Revo’s and Dan was<br>
playing Court.  Dan takes control of the Chamber quickly and gets a ship to Kashyyyk to<br>
drain at.  Chris is have trouble finding all the cards he needs for a beatdown.  Meanwhile<br>
Chris is loosing to the Court gametext and the drains.  Soon Chris starts to comeback. <br>
Gets Mutible Destines but Jodo Cast takes one of those away.  Dan Starts battles just to<br>
cancel them with Projective and has a steady drain in space.  Soon Chris gets out the<br>
Falcon, but Denger and Punishing comes to stop immunity and it didn’t last long.  It<br>
looked like both players had a chance until Lateral Damage with a track 6 and 5 destiny<br>
finished Chris.  Dan wins by 15.  I wasn’t watching Kris and Matt to closely, by Matt got<br>
his retrieval engine working very good.  Kris didn’t have secret plans which he doesn’t<br>
know why and I am sure he is kicking himself for in now.  Matt was in complete control<br>
after he retrieved his lost pile winning by 40. Brandon also won his last game by 34 and<br>
went to check if Kris won his game, because if Kris did Brandon would have been in the<br>
final, but as it turned out, Matt won.<br>
<br>
So the final confrontation was going to be Matt Berta vs Dan Christy.  The competition at<br>
this tournament was very high and yet everyone was having fun and the sportsmanship<br>
was very admirable.  Even the top Nevada players that took each other down were being<br>
great when they didn’t make the final. We had lots of prize for everyone.  The Top three<br>
got T-shirts from my personal collection. During the rounds to discourage people from<br>
stalling I had a special prize for the first person done with the game.  And even something<br>
special for the most creative deck title.  Here are the standings of the tournament.  I put<br>
what the Top 6 Players were playing to help see what won this tourney.  And if you want<br>
to read what happen in the Final Confrontation read after the standings.<br>

Wow I bet your are wondering who played the 60 random cards deck.<br>
<br>
Well there you have the standings. You can stop here if you want, or you can read the<br>
Final Confrontation.<br>
<br>
Game 1 Final Confrontation<br>
<br>
Dan Christy is Dark playing Court and Matt Berta is Light playing Falcon Deck.  This<br>
game is close the whole time.  Matt is getting burned for a while at his Holo Table because<br>
Dan is drain there with a Monnok for a few turns. Soon Matt takes it back with a POAS<br>
and the Super Falcon comes out and dominates space for the whole game, but Dan was<br>
taking care of Order to Engage by starting a battle retrieving and then playing Projection<br>
of Telepathy for most of the game.  I like to count mistakes people make during games<br>
and this one was full of mistakes.  First of all Dan forgot a Total of 12 TIMES to use<br>
Court’s Game text to make Matt lose force and on top of that for at least 5 turns that I<br>
noticed Dan Occupied 3 Battle Grounds and still allowed Matt to drain for 3 at Kessel<br>
with Resistance out.  Matt made very few mistakes that I noticed.  He Retrieved a lot<br>
during this game which almost made it go to time.  The game was close with it being over<br>
in 59 Min and 24 Seconds.  Dan Wins by 6.<br>
<br>
Close Matt only needs to win by 7 or Dan needs to stop him.<br>
<br>
Game 2 of the Final Confrontation<br>
<br>
Matt is playing a Hunt Down with Fake Duel.  He makes people play with caution with<br>
the dueling, but doesn’t have any dueling in his deck.  Dan is playing a Yoda Hut Start<br>
with Goo Nee Tay and twix Sites...he has 2 battle grounds in there just in case, but plays<br>
them only if he needs them.  Anyway Dan seems in complete control of this game early on. <br>
He take out Vader after Vader with destiny 5’s.  Matt is making a lot of mistakes like<br>
forgetting to Altar Goo Nee Tay when he has 2 Altar’s in his HAND...and it was on the 7<br>
side of Hunt down...what is up with that  Soon Matt brings out more Vaders and takes<br>
out Obi and crew.  Now Dan is stuck with putting down Scrub’s or looking for Obi.  Luke<br>
is stuck at the Med Chamber and can’t drain because of the 7 side of Hunt down and Dan<br>
can’t flip it back, because Matt keeps sensing his Nabrun’s.  At towards the end of the<br>
game Matt has 6 cards in his life force and Dan is thinking about Drawing up to make it a<br>
Tie in the Final and Matt quickly Altar’s Something and even did a successful Elis to bring<br>
up his Life force.  Dan now decided not to draw up because of this and let’s Matt Drain<br>
him out and bring up his life force.  Matt wins by 10 force.<br>
<br>
Matt Berta 2(+4)<br>
Dan Christy 2(-4)<br>
<br>
Wow.  What a Final Confrontation.  Congratulation to Matt Berta for being the Nevada<br>
State Champion of the Year 2000.  And the Runner up Dan Christy.  Both will get a bye<br>
into Day 2 of the Continental Championships at Gen Con and I wish them luck if they go.<br>
<br>
Lots of pictures were taken that I will probably post on my web site.  I really enjoyed<br>
running this tournament and will be looking forward to the next big one here.  Of course<br>
even though I enjoyed running it, maybe the next one I will be playing, who knows.<br>
<br>
Until Next Time,<br>
