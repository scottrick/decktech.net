This is Eric Hunter talking about a tournament in Albany, NY for a sheet for reflection foils. Any how, my brother Hayes, Steebo &amp;#8220;stevie B&amp;#8221;, and Mike &amp;#8220;deck&amp;#8221;. Decide we are going to go to Albany. The plan was that they where going to come over Friday night to play test and then we would leave in the morning together, but the parents didn&amp;#8217;t allow, so we just picked them up at stebbo;s place. We drive to Albany and I am trying to decide what to play in the car. I just decide to play dark surgeon that went 3-1 at RamapoCon, cause I like it more then the maul shaft deck I have. So anyway I borrow 2 emperor;s from Steebo and for light I have the same wys beats I have been playing since 2 weeks before tat came out. It has only lost 3 tournament games so far, and 1 was a fluke. So anyway I had came here a month ago and won the bounty tournament so I was determined to do well again. So anyway we get to Albany like an hour early cause of er&amp;#8230; good traffic hehe. So we decide to go straight to twigg central and say hi. So we drive past the halfmoon exit to where the gamer;s guild is and continue onto Malta. The home of the Twiggs, the little sub-town that is part of Ballston Lake or whatever it is, has less then my town, meaning no gas station, thought it had a karate learning place at the Malta mall. Anywho it&amp;#8217;s a nice area and we go to the Twiggs house and Hayes just opens their door, not bothering to knock. I come in to find all the Twiggs getting ready to leave, and mother Twigg helping them get off, while sister Twigg just sits around, it was crazy with the addition of us 4 so we just say we will meet you there and head off like 20 minutes later. So we get there at like 10:40 and wait another 40 minutes till the tournament starts because there where some people from Michigan who stayed at Joe jigga;s starfish Gianiti;s house the night before and they where a little late in coming. Anyway the tournament starts at 11:20. Here is what the people from mass are playing.<br>
<br>
Me- WYS beats and dark surgeon.<br>
Hayes- Bunker blowing, pod racing and You may start your landing.<br>
Steebo- QMC and You may start your landing.<br>
Deck- QMC and Maul madness.<br>
<br>
Game 1 my light vs I can&amp;#8217;t believe I forget your name right now tdigwatt.<br>
First turn he gets out 2 2/1 cc sites, the cc db, and bespin. So my turn I activate like 10 force so that is huge. I get Mirax in ship to his bespin and pull battle plan with my insight, I do not deploy it though. Hie turn he activates and just draws. I activate and drain and then flip with somebody to the cantina. He activates and draws a few a lets me go. I activate and back Mirax up and drain letting him go, holding a barrier and dodge. His turn he activates and deploys the executer, which I barrier. He then deployed some pilots on the executer. I come down with some stuff and take out the executer and that was the game basically. He made a few other attempts in space, though I just squashed em. On the ground I had Melas running form Vader and stick, guri, and Dr.e and Ponda buba. From there I just drained him out.<br>
FW by 29<br>
Highs: winning I guess.<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
Only 2 dark wins that round, Mr. Twigg vs. operatives and Hayes vs. WYS(I think)<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. brother of sorry I can&amp;#8217;t remember your name right now&amp;#8217;s HB.<br>
So I activate and play walkumi, get curscant DB out and move over, drawing up. I get out the death star: DB and emperor and move them over. He just gets out some systems and ships there. So I am doing like 7 damage a turn because of drains, and my objective. I make him lose 11 cards when bosk and Zuckuss and 2 tracked 6&amp;#8217;s meet a lone y-wing with pilot. From there I get broken concentration to win by 33.<br>
FW by 33<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning by so much with dark<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs. Chris Shaut&amp;#8217;s Pile (a.k.a. Hayes brilliant pile).<br>
I activate and put down the death star war room and curoscant DB and move Xizor over. He gets out 2 twixes, Shmi, and the naked droid to his slave quarters. I activate and deploy the emperor along with a Vigo and move them to the Death star DB, and let him go. He puts down epp Luke along with a bomar monk to his slave quarters so I unflip. On his turn I try to set for stun the bomar monk, but I miss. I activate and play no escape. I then get the spaceport DB to tat and move my guys over along with Guri. His turn he just puts out more twixes and draws I believe. My turn I play a Vigo to my curoscant DB, but he barriers, so I move my other one over and he goes. His turn he plays qui-Gon to my Guri, Emperor, and Xizor, I barrier. He tries to sense but I control it. He follows with corran and epp obi to my Vigo&amp;#8217;s. I just need to lose both. Good bye corran, and then obi, epp luke, and the bomar monk joining Qui-Gon. I come down with aurra and iggy and battle. I play I have you now. I would play force lightning, but I don&amp;#8217;t have enough force because he grabbed my other. He misses guri with a swing. I miss the capture. He misses guri with the swing again. I draw my 4 destiny drawing a 6, 3, 1, and 0&amp;#8230;EWWWW. Last time I drew 4 destiny with this deck it totaled 22. So he just loses a monk and qui-gon. He smoked screened qui-gon so I lost guri. I forget what happens elswhere on curoscant but I remember we had another key battle where I force lighting epp luke and capture him, he then swings and hits the emperor, blindly. I then draw a 0, the only one floating in my deck. So I lose everything and he gets back luke. From there with DTF and first strike on table I try to do hit and runs to get back some key cards, but I get Barriered and stuff and he is draining for 2 at my spaceport DB. So then they call time and he just Barriered. So he battles and does 10 overflow, so he gets a timed win of 20 to my 6. His diff was plus 2 cause of the 2 effects, and he made me lose 12 that turn. If I hadn&amp;#8217;t deployed denar and battled and then ghhhked (I had a vigo there) I could of won. <br>
TL by 20<br>
<br>
Highs: it was a great game<br>
Lows: none.<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs. joe jigga gianti.. ahh I can&amp;#8217;t spell it right. Triple the battle followed by 4 destiny adders hdadtj.<br>
I activate and get out Mirax to tat first turn and let him go. Basically they we are losing to visage and then he deploys epp vader to my cantina. My turn I deploy epp Han to the spaceport DB and battle plan. So he dosen&amp;#8217;t drain but visage is anoyying. So finaly I get the beats, but he left 8 force, I use mirax then delpoy lando in falcon to tat, he then yabs han. Dang. I just wait a turn then deploy my second beggar and this time he dosen&amp;#8217;t have yab, so I beat vader down for 33.(tripple, run luke runk, don&amp;#8217;t get c.ocky) He has 2 cards left. I drain him out.<br>
FW by 20<br>
<br>
Highs: deck working like a charm<br>
Lows: none.<br>
<br>
Game 5 vs. steebo QMC<br>
I get a god hand with my 2 only 2 twixes, I get xizor to the curscant db and draw up. His turn he gets out a site and epp leia to her hut. I activate 15 I think, then take out leai with aurra and iggy, capturing her. Then xizor moves over to the &lt;&gt; DB I played to walkumi. He just gets out more sites and takes out xizor with epp obi. I play no escap to get him back  then get xizor, guri, and epp fett to the other stie and let him go. He gets out another site and draws. I drain and get emperorer to another cc site so he has to take out one of my sites to flip as he only plays 4 cc sites. So he tries to take out a site with pathing then sorry, but I just set for stun the lando, and since bad feeling is out and he is activating only like 12 he can&amp;#8217;t mount a beat down. So he goes to space, but zuckuss and bosk are recking house with tracked destinies. I am activating like 20 force a turn too, so my objective is letting me draw nothing but 6s. broken concentration scomes out to cut his activation by 1 and lets me put my hand back.<br>
FW by 24<br>
<br>
Highs: beating a deck I normaly couldn&amp;#8217;t with a good hand.<br>
Lows: beating a friend<br>
<br>
Game 6 vs my bro&amp;#8217;s ymsyl<br>
I get Mirax to Hoth first turn, which he got with merijek. He plays no escape and gets evax on a blizzard walker with blizzard 2 to my &lt;&gt; db and he also gets tempest 1 to his 5th marker. I flip at the cantina and l get battle plan out. He goes after me in space but I beat him up, so he has to run away. He then moves the walkers and evax to hoth db he put out. I Play epp luke, epp han, and dash to them and battle. I retrive one he loses one. I triple it, play don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y. There is batle damage of 39, he loses everything and 13. From there I just drain and battle him out with DTF.<br>
Fw by 31<br>
<br>
Highs: my deck working well<br>
Lows: none<br>
<br>
So I find out Chris twigg who only lost one game won by only 29. That means I won. Anyway I give the sheet to my bro so he can sell it for me. Which means he gives it to the twiggs to sell for him. So we go to the twiggs to have burgers and play some pick up games. i play against chris and Brian twigg&amp;#8217;s tie deck and beat it 4 times. Then we play masterkades or whatever the sw playstation fighting game is. I beat brian cause he uses chewbacca, that was my only win. Chris was banned after 4 consecutive wins. Then the group from michigan showed up and we just played some more. Then brian got the demon cat pumpkin which hasn&amp;#8217;t been declawed and pressed her agaisnt my arm and back, I was screaming for him to stop, I have all these marks on me now cause of that. We tried to reason with our parents on the phone to let us stay the night. But to no avail, we leave at like 8:45 and get some gas and candy and caffeine to make it home. We play car poker on the way home. Using the lisence plates as hands. I win the last hand as we drop mike and steebo off. Hayes and mike race back to the highway going like 50 and stuff, again I was screaming for my life.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Mike- who be cool, and for playing hardcore and raw deal with me<br>
