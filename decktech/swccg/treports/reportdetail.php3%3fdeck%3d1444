This report at least I have the names of those I played and the right dif between the games.<br>
<br>
After the Mega Tournament in Phoenix, I was ready to go back to the Motel to change my decks.  But first We had to stop to get FOOOOD.  Must eat...so we went to Applebee&#146;s.  Matt Berta and I went to the bar and had a couple of drinks, and the rest of the crew were waiting for the table, which kind of sucked, but it was busy, so who can blame them.  During dinner was talking tech time, (yea right we were just looking at women).  Kris Lavigne makes this bet that he has to drink 20 glasses of Ice Tea, for $20 bucks or something, so I give the cute waitress(not really cute, but she would do) Five bucks, and tell her to leave a picture of tea for him.  However soon he realizes 20 was too much, and then it went to 10...which Kris did it, but not before he barfed.  Didn&#146;t even make it to the toilet.. (sorry Applebee&#146;s)  After having a few more drinks myself I am feeling kinda good now.  Time to get back to the Hotel.  By the way, I don&#146;t know how far you can run, but if you were in Preston AZ...then it wouldn&#146;t be that far.<br>
<br>
I get back and start fine tuning my BHBM deck and take out cards from my Huntdown to complete.  Kris and Shane decide to go with the same decks, but really they had little choice since they didn&#146;t bring changes.  With light I still went with MWYHL, but made like 10 card changes to it.  I had much less sleep tonight just because for some reason I was tossing in turning, and waking up through out the night.  Oh well, I wake up early and make a new decklist.  And when I got there I found out we didn&#146;t need decklist.<br>
<br>
Before we go to the Grand Slam however, we go to breakfast.  We didn&#146;t have the brownie the night before, so Shane and I insist that it will work in the morning as well......  Well it works for others here so we had to try.  Denny&#146;s is not far so we go.  My first look at the brownie, and I am like you must be crazy, I will stick with Moon over ham...or some gay name like that..(really gay name, think about it.)  Shane gets the Brownie, by telling the waitress I want that right there.  And Kris get&#146;s a Grand Slam Breakfast.  Yes once again Kris out does us, because now he will win, since he ordered a Grand Slam Breakfast and he is going to a Grand Slam. Heheha... funny, you had to be there.  To the tourney..now...<br>
<br>
We thought we were late, but Girard was waiting on some late arrivals, and we start around??? I forgot..anyway we start.<br>
<br>
Game 1 My DS vs Clayton Atkins x-wing Swarm<br>
<br>
Well wouldn&#146;t you know it, I have to start the tourney with a tough opponent, which means tough game.  he starts hidden base, and at first I am not worried.  But when I saw he had SAC protection like crazy, I thought Swarm no Doubt about it.  Lucky for me I had a Monnok in my starting draw.  And on the second turn, I played it, and got 5 x-wings out of his hand, right after he goes gets 3 more with All Power, and uses one with a drain I had.  So I know he has at least 2 x-wings in his hand after he drew up on his next turn, so I was like what the heck.  I play Masterful Move, and get my second Monnok, and play it, and get 2 x-wings, 2 Odds, 2 Signals...another good Monnok.  From there I pretty much stayed with a lot of ships at on system so I wouldn&#146;t get beat down, and finally found Search and Destroy to make it even a more headache for him, and he miss counted at one time...which help me make him lose force since Luke was not at a Battle ground and that was it for him.  He said this is the first time that deck lost all weekend.  That was kinda cool.<br>
Full Win by 13<br>
2(+13)<br>
<br>
Highs: This was the first time Clayton and I ever played. We always see each other at these big events, but we never played.. got to love that.<br>
<br>
Lows: Swarm decks are tough, I didn&#146;t want to play one, but did.<br>
<br>
Game 2 My LS vs Brett Kitani&#146;s BHBM<br>
<br>
The last time I remember playing Brett was in New Mexico at the Regional there, and he was playing some deck with mega OOC.. I don&#146;t know if he remembered that, but at least I know I won, and that kind of helps when playing someone.  Brett doesn&#146;t make many mistake, and Kris just lost to him during Game 1 so he was yelling at me to get revenge for him.  I laugh and played my game.  Apparently my match up was great, because Brett had nothing for what I was doing to him.  He made a major mistake and left Zuchuss in Hunter, by himself in space and I spanked him with the superfalcon, followed by Legendary Starfighter.  That was it for him.<br>
Full win by 25<br>
4(+38)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Well things did go my way<br>
<br>
Lows: None I can think of<br>
<br>
Game 3 My DS vs Ben Robinsons EBO<br>
<br>
I remember yesterday day this guy freaked me out and said he was going to own me...but not out load.  Now I play him and he still says nothing, but I hear him say..&quot;you will lose my biitch&quot;.  I was like &quot;what did you say&quot;  he said &quot;boy my shoes itch&quot; ..I was like right...whatever.  I just have to say that I couldn&#146;t find anything I needed this game.  I did some really cool stuff, but it wasn&#146;t enough... He has like 14 scouts in front of just a couple of my guys, but doesn&#146;t battle, and I am just trying to wipe them out, because I know once they are gone then he will start lossing to Search and Destroy.  I monnok him for some cards, and he kills one of my Lone ships...( why did I put out a lone ship?)  Anyway he is master now, because I lose to him twice over this weekend.<br>
Full Loss by 8<br>
4(+38)<br>
<br>
highs: Having a new owner, my old one didn&#146;t treat me so well :)<br>
<br>
Lows: I am now this guys biitch :)<br>
<br>
Game 4 My LS vs Michael Patriquin&#146;s Monkey Tie&#146;s<br>
<br>
Well this guy is playing the same deck we all know and love from Decktech...yes Monkey Tie&#146;s.  Funny things happen in this game, but I have to say, my deck just never loses to Ties.. it is a natural counter to it, without trying.  The game did take awhile, but what do you expect... he had retrieval.  <br>
Full Win by 18<br>
6(+56)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well my ls will not lose today..thats cool<br>
<br>
Lows:  Taking so long to get what I needed to win sooner.. almost went to time.<br>
<br>
Game 5 My DS vs Ben Wehunt Hidden Base<br>
<br>
Well all I remember in this game was making some huge mistake, and I lost this battle, and I am hoping I can pull myself out of it.  He then deploys Liberty, then Haven, and then Home one, and smacks down on my LONE ship and draws and 7 and a 6,??!@!  WTF.  I had to lose like 14 cards, plus my ship, and I didn&#146;t think I had a chance.  Which I didn&#146;t.  I capture luke and start dueling with him.  He does something not smart and I stack my 4 card under my card.  I have only 2 cards left so I know I have no chance, but if I did have at least on more card..( the last card I lost was a 4 that would do it) I would have one.  Cool... Not like ... out never mind.<br>
Full Loss by 28<br>
6(+28)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Nothing I got smashed.<br>
<br>
Lows: Losing a major battle in space, and he said he did know what he was going to draw...man...I had to lose way to many cards.<br>
<br>
Game 6 MY LS vs Geoff Snider&#146;s BHBM<br>
<br>
Well I think my deck does good against BHBM.  I play my game, give him AFA, and wait, I do this and that.  Give him Uncontrollable fury, and Superfalcon comes out.  He has major ships, and lots of power everywhere pretty much.  I revo two of his docking bays, making free docking for me, and high cost for him.  And with Honor out no drain their for him.  We have this major battle in space where I have like 7 destinys to his 3 and he still wins the battle.. I forgot to stack a card for losing that battle Geoff sorry.  But I couldn&#146;t play Legendary either.  This was actually a very fun game, because Geoff jokes around a lot while playing and you got to love that.  Anyway in the long run he really had nothing for what I was doing to him so I win.<br>
Full Win by 14<br>
8(+42)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Well my LS went Undefeated and that is hard to come by.<br>
<br>
Lows: He told me to drain for 100 and I almost did.. :)<br>
<br>
Well I finish the tournament 4-2 which was only good enough for 7 place, and I had to live with that.  I had an awesome time this whole weekend, no matter how I did, and Mike did an awesome job...more props for him.<br>
<br>
I would get into the trip back, but that one was even more crazier than the trip there.  We go to Chili&#146;s to eat before heading for Vegas.  And we waiting for like 30 minutes before we eat.  Matt Berta is doing some Disappearing act on us, and really acting change, but he doesn&#146;t know it.(Ask me later Matt..its funny).  We start insulting one another, because there is nothing better to do, then it happens.  The sexyest girl comes to us and takes us to our seat.  Dam she is probably only 20, but I am thinking the worst thoughts.  She had everything in the right place... I mean everything.  Without being a fan of the Awesome Blossom I had to order 2 for the table. :)  I hope no one gets offended, but this girl had an Awesome blossom... oh and a nice snatch too.. :) That was funny.. thanks Shane for that.  We order and are Waitress looks about my age, so I start acting cool, but then she smiles, and I get scared and try to be boring so she won&#146;t smile again.  We of course have a good time here and hit the road.<br>
<br>
I must be awesome, because without using any help, I am going the right way(shut up guys) and half way there Matt&#146;s Car behind us disappears.  First I think he made some major sacrifice, but then I think he past us.  Turns out he was just tired, but I will not get into the details.  If you want to know about that nightmare, asked me later.  Long story short we are home... From a cool Weekend.<br>
