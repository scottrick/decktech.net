<br>
First of all, apologies to all.  I haven't been as active as I'd like lately and I hadn't realized that no one enjoyed 2 part tournament reports anymore.  That's ok.  My rationale was that it had taken me quite a while to put part 1 together and friends were wanting to see some sort of report.  I decided that it would be worth it.  I'm sorry you guys didn't like it, it won't happen again.  Anyway, on to part 2!  For background this is the Missouri State Championships, we had 32 people in attendance.<br>
<br>
I would like to entitle this tournament report 'It Came Down To One Card -- Missouri State Championship Part 1,' but there wasn't enough room for the full title in submission.  You'll find out exactly why I say this very soon...<br>
<br>
At this point in the tournament I am 2-1 with a 4(+74) differential.  So far so good.<br>
<br>
Game 4: Running with Scissors vs. Dustin Horn's Hidden Base / OMDH deck.<br>
<br>
If you've read any of my tourney reports, you would know that somehow I always end up playing my brother.  We were really hoping today would be different, but it was not our destiny.  Somehow we just managed to be near enough in placing to play each other.  AARGH!  He is playing a Hidden Base deck that retrieves force via Our Most Desperate Hour and Tatooine Celebration, using Monks to enhance drains and more retrieval.  The deck never flips.  My Ralltir Ops deck, however, doesn't have a difficult time beating it.  I start Bad Feeling Have I, he starts Wise Advice.  On my turn I deploy a &lt;&gt; site from hand and reserve, draw one and call it good.  He deploys Tatooine from reserve and draws.  By turn three I have a flip and I'm dealing a bit of damage by small drains.  His next move is to deploy Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke with Lightsaber, and a Monk to Obi-Wan's Hut.  My turn comes and I deploy Darth Vader, Tarkin, and 4-Lom with Gun to take them out.  I battle, canceling Luke's text, and he uses Glancing Blow to ease his pain.  I play I Have You Now but can't total enough to eliminate all three (as I'm sure he would not just leave the monk alone, I needed to get twelve or better).  I managed about 10 in destiny even when adding with Rops and Vader. What a bum deal!  I cleared out everybody but Luke though, so I stood my ground since he had only 1 card in his hand.  There was no way he could manage to get an assault through.  As I thought, he just moved Luke.  Next turn I activate and pull a Tempest Scout from reserve to put Tarkin on, so he can't be hit.  Now I'm draining for about 5 and he's not causing me any damage.  Then he deploys a bunch of guys he drew and runs Our Most Desperate Hour to retrieve 14 force!   So now I'm nearly starting over!  Oh-well, nothing I could have done about it, Secret Plans was the card of my force pile I was saving for reacting.  Once I figured that out I found a way to pull it and deploy it before he could do so again.  Then Dustin moved the Falcon with Captain Han and Leia with Blaster to my Death Star for a drain of 2.  Now he was far enough away from Tatooine that I could assault his Red Squadron X-Wing and Red Leader in Red 1.  I manage to deploy Bossk in Bus, Zuckuss in BMW, AND Boba Fett in Slave I to beat him down for about 15 force.  After this all I had to do was keep up his drain by losing from my hand and running away with my other guys, draining all the while.  He was gone in about 2 turns, and I win by 24.<br>
<br>
Highs: none, really, because I hate playing my brother in tournament play.  It really hurts to have to beat him.<br>
Lows: again, none.<br>
Score: 6(+98)<br>
<br>
Game 5: Running With Scissors vs. Todd Vandewalker's Profit<br>
<br>
This game was long and hard, it was another incredible match-up.  Moreover, it became the turning point for me in the tournament.  It all started Friday night when I took out Point Man...  Bad Norman...  Read on...  Todd starts Goo Nee Tay, I start Imperial Arrest Order.  Since I have no aliens, he does have a quick advantage.  On my turn I deploy the Swamp from reserve, then another site, Blizzard Scout 1, and Lt. Arnet (free baby!) from hand.  He deploys Ben Kenobi and frees Han.  It all starts downhill when on his next turn he deploys Order to Engage.  Oh Lord have mercy, this could get nasty!  Why?  I took out my Point Man last night.  That made the total difference in this game.  On the next turn he Nabruns Ben Kenobi, Orrimaarko, AND Han to my Swamp where I have a lone Blizzard Scout 1.  I deploy Tempest 1 plus Igar to the Swamp and battle.  I catch him a little by surprise when I force him to lose Han and revive him, which means that his objective flips back since for an instant Han is NOT ON THE TABLE.  Well, at least I thought it was a surprise (was it Todd?).  I move away, not anxious to be dealt a bunch of damage next turn.  Now the general form of the turns is me draining, losing force to order to Engage, then moving away from his huge force.  The losses are balanced because he and I are losing the same amounts, but I'm taking more of the hurt because HE doesn't have to draw any cards to formulate a plan!  I can't beat up his force of Ben, Big-O, Han, Leia, and Chewie, so while I'm running Darth Vader and his Saber sneak into the Audience Chamber for a drain of 3.  Within a few turns Todd Nabruns all his guys back to Jabba's Palace (it had to be exterior since IAO was on the table of course), and he flips back his objective.  I run around for a turn then deploy IG-88 with Riot Gun plus a Tempest Scout with an At-st pilot.  I battle, send Han to the used pile with Iggy, but I'm unable to give myself enough damage to get rid of ALL my guys.  Vader is left and he has to run again.  Again I end up just on the unlucky side.  I get dealt a few more damage to Order to Engage, allowing Todd to win the game.<br>
<br>
Highs: It was a great game despite the problems (right Todd!).  I met another Decktech friend.<br>
Lows: Losing another game, knocking me out of first place contention.  TAKING OUT THE POINT MAN!!!  Had I not done so, the game would have been mine.  Even had he sensed it, I had Oppressive Enforcement out.<br>
Score: 6(+92)<br>
<br>
This brings me out of the race, but I'm not through yet...<br>
<br>
Game 6: Off the Deep End vs. ??????'s (sorry man I can't remember your name!) Hunt Down<br>
<br>
Wow, ANOTHER chance against Hunt Down.  Apparently lots of people were playing it.  He starts the regular stuff with Epic Duel, and his starting interrupt is... he uses no starting interrupt? Hmm, that's confusing, he didn't even start Crush!  I'm thinking this could be pretty easy.  I get a couple of Revos and a twix site in my starting hand, plus Master Luke.  I deploy the site, a Nudj from reserve, and Revo the Meditation Chamber.  He activates 3 force and draws.  My turn, I attempt to deploy the second Nudj — it's NOT THERE!  Just when I thought nothing could get worse.  I draw some cards, getting the Nudj, Ben Kenobi, and a Tatooine site.  Next turn I deploy BK to Jundland Wastes and finally the second Nudj.  His next move is to deploy Mara Jade and her Saber to the Farm, and he kills the Nudj.  I deploy Master Luke to the Wastes, then Nabrun over Ben Kenobi to take out Mara.  He does so with ease.  Next turn he saves his force.  I Nabrun back Ben and deploy the Sabers I drew.  In 2 turns he deploys the Endor, the Back Door, Presence of the Force (to the Door), Vader, Saber, and Motti.  I deploy Traffic Control in my turn and draw, getting another Nabrun (can you tell Nabrun Leids was a big factor in this game?).  On the next turn I deploy Orrimaarko with the boys and Nabrun over.  I battle, killing everything but Vader.  Next turn he deploys Bossk in Hound's Tooth and shuttles Vader up there.  Then he deploys Tarkin and shuttles Vader back down.  Oooh.  He DUELS LUKE!!!!  Oh baby, here we go!  I'll relate this duel to the Episode 1 duel.  The door opens, Vader and Tarkin walk into the clearing.  Luke turns to Ben and Big-0, 'I'll handle this.'  He walks across the clearing, stops, and removes his hood.  'We meet again, Young Skywalker.'  'Today will be different Father.'  'We shall see.'  The lightsabers ignite and the battle begins!  I play Courage of a Skywalker!  He plays Focused Attack!  I draw a 4.  His destiny, 3.  Mine, 4.  His, 3.  Mine, 5.  His — 3 again!!!  Vader is sliced to itty-bitty pieces, and Tarkin is all alone!  Aww, poor Tarkin...  I battle and put an end to his suffering.  Win by 27.<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning a duel against Vader.<br>
Lows: none.<br>
Score: 8(+119)<br>
<br>
So despite 2 losses, I have like the highest differential in the tournament.  So I place fifth overall, and win a $10 gift certificate to the Fantasy Shop.  I learned a very important lesson today — NEVER leave home without a Point Man (or Alters) in your Ralltir Ops deck.  Well, it was disappointing to lose, but it was great fun!<br>
<br>
The predominate deck type for Dark was actually Hunt Down, which is ironic since in the recent tournaments there has been a decline in Hunt Down.  Hidden Base didn't rear it's ugly head except in a few cases, I expected more of these.  Profit was actually prominent, I believe I heard that there were about 5 present.  Ralltir Ops had a good showing, but most people opted for Hunt Down instead.  Throne Room decks were non-existent -- save mine.  ;-)  Umm, what else... ISB wasn't very popular, I only heard about maybe 2 of them.  That's about the best info I could give for this.<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
