<br>
It all started around the beginning of the week.  I got a call from Adam saying &amp;#8216;I have mad tech.&amp;#8217;  It was true.  The tech was mad.  Insane.  Utterly devastating.  But I&amp;#8217;m not going to tell you what it was.<br>
<br>
So, yeah, I was mucking around and I had two decks built- Garisson and some Slave Quarters deck.  Problem was that I didn&amp;#8217;t own a Shmi or Threepio, but I left it like it was to do some playtesting with.  The Garisson deck was OK, but I&amp;#8217;d played something similar last tournament (going undefeated, I might add) and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to play it twice in a row.  Apparently the big D doesn&amp;#8217;t like Scum.  Apparently I like Scum.  Apparently that was the challenge.   A Scum deck that could get around The Camp.  Rock on.<br>
<br>
Saturday rocks around and Adam, Illiyana and I do some playtesting.  I play one game with Scum against Illiyana&amp;#8217;s Profit.  The Profit deck was tight.  Adam came up with it (with a little input from me) for the states.  It went undefeated at states.  Very tight.  Of course, I was surprised to hammer it.  Bad Feeling + No Bargain are very bad for Profit if you throw in a few NSP &amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
1 am and everything was looking fine.  Except for one thing.  I still had a pile of light cards with no Shmi or Threepio.  Adam had a pile of dark cards which he had no idea what he was doing with.  We figure he&amp;#8217;s playing Agents and I&amp;#8217;m playing QMC, so we go and build the decks.  He then goes on to build a WYS deck.  I&amp;#8217;m still sitting there building my QMC deck.  67 cards.  Oh well, out goes the fun Legendary/DDTA/Advantage bit.  Out goes some other card.  63.  I sit there and count it.  I sit there and count it again.  I did this about 10 times.  Meanwhile, Adam finishes making both of his decks.  I count it for the 50th time.  62!  Yes!  &amp;#8230; Take out 2 cards and there you go.  No idea how I did that.<br>
<br>
So yeah, we finally leave in time to get to the tournament.  I took a look through Terry (the TD&amp;#8217;s) sale folder and made some comment about how he&amp;#8217;d priced up the AI Qui-Gon.  He said yeah and reminded me that he&amp;#8217;d sold me one the other week for ½ the price before we knew what they were going for.  Terry&amp;#8217;s a dude, so I offer to trade it back to him for a normal one and cards if he wants, seeing as he was low on Qui-Gons.  Terry says no, but then goes and trades for a normal one and trades with me.  I&amp;#8217;m like OK, I&amp;#8217;m interested in this.  Terry&amp;#8217;s like OK, take it all.  I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8230; OK.  Terry&amp;#8217;s like hang on, I don&amp;#8217;t have a Command sitting around.  Anyhow, to cut a long story short, we&amp;#8217;re both so concerned about not ripping each other off that we end up with some big trade involving some cash and 2 Mauls on top of everything and I&amp;#8217;m like that&amp;#8217;s still a bit unfair for you so I&amp;#8217;ll throw in some more cash and Terry&amp;#8217;s like well, fine then, I&amp;#8217;ll up the ante and throw in a box of Tatooine w/out rares seeing as I know that you&amp;#8217;re not buying boxes and I&amp;#8217;m like OK.  Cool.  That&amp;#8217;s fair now.  Man, what a legend.<br>
<br>
So, to recap, I traded AI Qui-Gon and Cash for 2 Maul, Qui-Gon and stuff.  <br>
<br>
On to the bloody tournament already!<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
<br>
Me (the man):<br>
Dark: Scum (SYCFA)<br>
Light: QMC<br>
<br>
Adam (runner up states, dude):<br>
Dark: Agents<br>
Light: WYS<br>
<br>
Illiyana (apprentice, Adam&amp;#8217;s fiancee, dudette):<br>
Dark: Walker Garisson<br>
Light:  Profit<br>
<br>
Sean (apprentice, old player, also a dude):<br>
Dark: Podracing Ties<br>
Light WYS asteroids (we built it together, it&amp;#8217;s tech)<br>
<br>
GAME ONE Light vs &amp;#8230; Illiyana (Walker Garisson)<br>
<br>
Well, there weren&amp;#8217;t that many people there, so there was a fair chance that it might happen.  Basically, she played a good game and set up her damage, but I played right and was able to handle it all with suicide EPPs and 7s as well as Menace Fades, Caldera/Gimer Stick lock etc.  Adam had played her deck against me and beat me because he had managed to flip one of the 4AOs every time for battle destiny without tracking, so I was keen to show that I could actually beat it.<br>
<br>
FW(22)<br>
2(+22)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Umm &amp;#8230; revenge?<br>
The Bad:  Didn&amp;#8217;t want to play Illiyana.<br>
The Ugly:  Naked Threepio &amp;#8230; Edge every turn for 6 w/out using KTEOF &amp;#8230; cool.<br>
<br>
GAME TWO Dark vs Stephen (QMC/Podracing)<br>
<br>
Stephen is a great player, but to get a little more insight, have a look at my first turn.<br>
<br>
Stephen: &amp;#8216;The race is on.&amp;#8217;<br>
<br>
Stacks Imperial Attrocity and Sunsdown.  Great player, always with something different.  Anyhow, I set up Gaillid at the AC and some scrubs to drain.  Stephen was being a little slow to do anything seeing as he could only start KTEOF.  In contrast, I got a lightning fast start with an early JP and Twi&amp;#8217;lek for BFHI.  BFHI is cool.  Anyhow, it was about turn 3 or 4 and Stephen hadn&amp;#8217;t done too much, so I dumped Xizor to the Downtown Plaza, Fett and Dr. E to JP and Aurra to the Casino, with Search and Destroy.  I had also put back a Visage, NSP and another 5 that I can&amp;#8217;t remember via Reactor Terminal (Old Skool!).  Stephen, hampered by BFHI, dropped EPP Leia to Xizor.  Fine.  Protector.  Barrier.  EPP Han.  Barrier.  Stephen then ended his turn.<br>
<br>
I activated some, then Controlled Chewie Protector back to Stephen&amp;#8217;s hand (well, Set For Stun, if you insist &amp;#8230; I still say it was a Control).  Monnoked Stephen and saw he had sweet FA.  Activated a bit more, drained for 6 or so, Elised Fett and Dr. E to the Downtown Plaza, Disarmed Leia, dropped 4-LOM and Dannik Jerriko or some schmoe, picked a fight, cancel, shoot, draw 5 and 7 &amp;#8230; Han and 21 cards, leaving Stephen with 2 force.  He won the podrace in my move phase, though, making me lose 6 and him retrieve 6 (secret plans wasn&amp;#8217;t out).  Steve hung on for another turn and that was it.<br>
<br>
FW(27?)<br>
<br>
4(+49)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Scum is dead, is it?<br>
The Bad:  Not too much, not having a power 3 or more guy instead of DJ so that I could&amp;#8217;ve won without losing to the podrace.<br>
<br>
GAME THREE Light vs &amp;#8230; Adam?!<br>
<br>
OK, well this was fine, seeing as Adam is a mizer and he should&amp;#8217;ve run out of luck today.  Basically, this game was fairly boring.  It involved me drawing the same 7 for edge destiny about 10 times and Adam draining for heaps.  The deciding factor was me playing the North Corridor a turn before I wanted to (I could&amp;#8217;ve sworn that there was another site in the force that I used the turn before).  Adam put Palpy there the next turn, which slowed me down a fair bit.  Anyhow, he caused me damage and I retrieved.  I was in complete control, but he had gotten a fast start.  Anyhow, I had set up to have Luke Sorry About the Mess Bane Malar and then beat down on Dengar with the 6 that I had put back as a backup destiny, but then Terry, who had told us time was up a few minutes ago came and said hands down &amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure that the player who&amp;#8217;s turn it is is supposed to finish their turn, at least, but whatever.<br>
<br>
TL (-20?)<br>
5(+29)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Adam lost, and he knew it.<br>
The Bad:  I lost, and Terry recorded it.<br>
The Ugly:  I made ONE mistake - the North Corridor, which was something that could&amp;#8217;ve happened to anyone, and it lost me the game.  That&amp;#8217;s not right, seeing as I did everything else right and was not going to lose.  Oh well &amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
GAME FOUR Dark vs Rod (Profit)<br>
<br>
Rod is one of the best players in Australia, so it wasn&amp;#8217;t ever going to be an easy game.  Unfortunately for him, I was playing SYCFA scum, so it was an easy game.  Basically, I got BFHI within a turn or two, converted his sites on turn 1 and drew up some for Controls, NSP, Barrier etc.  Rod was forced to draw up some, so I monnoked him used.  I stacked the chamber.  Rod drew and did nothing.  I drew for my Ghhhk.  Rod drew some.  I monnoked him used.  I put Aurra, Bane and Search and Destroy out.  Rod tried to play Sense/Recoil, but I Controlled it.  Rod drew.  I rigged via Reactor Terminal.  Rod dumped some Twixes and drew.  Rod tried to Sense/Recoil.  I grabbed it, then controlled it.  Rod drew.  I monnoked him used.  I activated for my rig.  Rod Recoiled for 5 force (7 cards).  He then dropped the back door and drew.  I set up my rig again.  Rod dumped Qui-Gon and EPP Leia to the Back Door.  I Monnoked him in his turn, then Elised the gang from the AC to the Back Door.  Disarmed/Operated on Qui-Gon, played First Strike and won the game.<br>
<br>
FW(26)<br>
7(+55)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Absolute Domination.<br>
The Bad:  Didn&amp;#8217;t have grabber for Sense the first time round.<br>
The Ugly:  Dead is it?  Really?  How dead is Scum?<br>
<br>
So Adam ended up taking the tournament (next time, Adam, next time).  I got some random crap for prizes, which actually contained about 3 cards which I needed, so I was pretty happy with that.  Illiyana came last, and I think Sean came second last (that&amp;#8217;s not good).  Sean and I played a game while we were waiting (Scum v WYSanctuary) I activated one less than I should&amp;#8217;ve and as a consequence I drew a 0 instead of a 6 while he drew a 6 and cleared all but one guy off the site.  Anyhow, that was pretty much game, seeing as he then didn&amp;#8217;t have to pay for Battle Plan and S+D wasn&amp;#8217;t working.  We didn&amp;#8217;t have time to finish, but he would&amp;#8217;ve won.  Of course, had I activated one more :P<br>
<br>
Yeah, so that was basically it.<br>
<br>
Mad Props:<br>
<br>
Terry for the cards.<br>
Adam and Illiyana for the hospitality.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
<br>
Sean and Illiyana for playing.<br>
Rod for losing to me.<br>
Stu (Caldwell) for lending Adam and I cards at the last minute.<br>
Stuart Jones for the lift home and all of the mind games.<br>
Ronnie for not having to lend me cards :P<br>
Everyone else who I didn&amp;#8217;t mention for playing. <br>
Big D for making a really good C-3P0.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
<br>
None, really.<br>
Big D for &amp;#8216;Killing&amp;#8217; Scum?<br>
Big D for giving me 2 ratings (WTF?!)<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, if you haven&amp;#8217;t already seen Tombraider, I recommend it.  Aside from the fact that Angelina Jolie is taller lying down than standing up, it&amp;#8217;s a good brainless action flick.  Be sure to see it with a pack of other people, though, so that you can make snide remarks all through the movie.<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
