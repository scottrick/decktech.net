<br>
This is dedicated to Dan Lujan for his 21 birthday. Happy birthday man. Also for a s s holes out there. Listen up. My computers dictionary does not recognize star war terminology so deal with it. Thank you. I know this is an old tournament report but I promised a friend that I would write it. <br>
<br>
Pre tournament:<br>
<br>
Its around 1:00 in the after noon and I started to going to rancho to meet a Dan at his house. But half way there I remember that he works all night sleeps during the day. So I just stop by riverside get some food and go to tournament early. I knew Dan was turning 21 and he needed to go out for the night. John patchell made some plans over the bar and hang out all night long. He had the event set up and was ready to party.  The plan was to meet at the tournament, win some games and go party all night long. So I stop by the bank and got some money out. Got mediocre dressed, went to the tournament. <br>
<br>
Got to the tournament about 35 minute early to talk to Doug who was the storeowner and interesting man. But he is a nice old man. Anyway, Dan was their try to Twix some decks and talks some tech. I though I be one of the first one there but, I was not even close to it. They were already 7 people there for wars. Dan suggested that he needs to try a deck out before the tournament and I need to try this new ground deck that john and Dan was talking about. So I took out my watto&amp;#8217;s bullies and started to play. He telling me how to improve it and what to add to it. The thing is, Dan is a very talented ground deck player. I think he is in top 20 in the world. So we played for about 20 minutes and kicked the @#$% out of it. I mean he treat the bullies like a stepchild. But, I did not care. I knew the bullies would do something besides look good in the tournament.<br>
<br>
Light side: Hoth space race. Yes Hoth not echo base<br>
Dark side: Let see, the bullies or a tie deck. (ofcourse with my limited wisdom I tried the bullies)<br>
<br>
<br>
Tournament:<br>
<br>
First game:<br>
<br>
Andrews  (I think) vile gangster Vs my light side<br>
<br>
This is a new kid just started to play the game. He started with the usual stuff, the sites and no escape, mob points and all wrap up. This kid had the every thing to capture characters. He was ready to rumble. I start with echo junk. He laughed and said this is going to be a short game. In my mind, I said yep, for you. He nods it. He activated and deployed Mara to audience chamber and said go. I pulled naboo and activated. He was puzzled. I deployed naboo with a lone x-wing and lost one to his objective. (I lost to his objective for the rest of the game) He activated and drain for one and said go. I pulled Sullust and activated and drain for two. After that I deploy Sullust of course and an another x-wing. Kept my force and lost one again. I said go. He activated and drained for one and deployed Vader and tarking to outer marker and move them in which left him with no force. I pulled kiffexs and activated and drain for three. Deployed kiffexs deployed another x-wing and drew 5 and left two. Lost one to Objective. He was getting worried; he was getting nerves about me not deploying my echo sites. He did not know that, I do not have any sites for echo. He activated and drain for two and deployed couple of characters to Hoth and said go. I pulled Hoth, activated and drain him for 5 and deployed have over Hoth and drooped my rest of my hand with 6 x-wings to Hoth and dreaded ice storm to marker which made him lose the characters out there. He was shocked. He turned to me and said, &amp;#8220;do u have any echo sites. What is this?&amp;#8221; I said &amp;#8220; what you see what you get.&amp;#8221;  Noooooo no way dude.  I got the rest of the cards up and left 3 there. I had a ghkk and another ice storm with all wing reports in. Again lose one to his objective. He activated and drains me for 2, which lost the Vader and tarkin after that. I started to draw the cards. I activate and drained and deploy 4 more x-wings to free Hoth and move them to naboo and kiffex. Lose one to his objective. He activated, drained and right after that I did all wing reports in and retrieve everything there. That was the game.<br>
<br>
Full win by 23 +2<br>
<br>
Slops to him for insulting me. What the hell dude? <br>
Prompts to me for drain and keeping with my game. <br>
<br>
<br>
Game two<br>
<br>
Watto&amp;#8217;s bullies Vs someone&amp;#8217;s senate decks.<br>
<br>
This game was over before it started. I knew I had to make him lose to my objective. He started with Jedi counsel and senate and one effect was combo alter protection. So I activated and deployed watto for free, and bib to next site and put down a card to make him lose two and put down search and destroy for another lost of one. Three lose of force in the first turn. Wow. He was shocked. He activated and drew some cards. I told him to lose one to search and destroy. He loses it from the force pile. Before he knew what happen he was down to one force. I activated and drain for two and made him lose two. After that another lost for search and destroy. He was pissed. 9 lost by turn 2. Wow this was cool. He activated and deploys one senator to senate and left the force there. He was safe. (As he thought) He said go. I activated and drain for two and used his force to deploy Vader there and rest of my deployed tarking to senate. Initiated a battle and wow the battle but he had good forfeit. I moved the fools to Jedi consul for the maximum drain and made him lose to search and destroyed. He activated and deployed 3 senators to senate and to flip. He grabs something to stop my force drains with a senator. That was not cool. I activated and drain for 5 and he did not have any senators on hand that was cool. He lost 5 and 2 for my objective. That was the game. I drain him for 2-he drain for 1 and retrieve with market place. That was cool. <br>
<br>
Full win 26  + 4  (49)<br>
<br>
Slops to him for not going after wato<br>
Prompts to me for keeping the pressure<br>
Overall it was a good game. I knew I had to use my objective all the way. I had good cards and took some risks. Lots of risks like leaving wato alone. That took guts<br>
<br>
Game three<br>
<br>
Dan&amp;#8217;s mains and toys on tats deck Vs my watos bullies<br>
<br>
Now this was the worst game I ever played. This game was over in first turn. I activate and deploy wato to junk ward and bib to next door.  He plays lost in the wilderness and gets wato lost in first turn. Wow the game is over. I had to ask him how to retrieve the watto for crying out loud. I won one battle his camp and his Jedi&amp;#8217;s killed my off. There is nothing I can say. It was fast game. It lasted about 6 minutes I think. I made him deploy @#$% loads of characters for nothing so I do not take huge lost.  I believe, the lost of wato in the first turn killed me really bad psychologically. I was not ready for that. Good job Dan<br>
<br>
Full lose 32  + 4 (17)<br>
<br>
Slops to me for not guessing what he was going to do. I knew about the card and I knew that what was needs to be done. It was a bad thing him for me. Now I am 0-2-life time against him. <br>
Prompts to Dan for great card. Nice job<br>
Overall this was the highlight of the tournament. That was it. One card to kill me of. <br>
<br>
Game four <br>
<br>
Bomber deck Vs Hoth of my<br>
<br>
Yes this guyed played a bomber deck. It was over in minutes. I do not have any sites to be bombed and he does not have any drains. But he was a good friend who I went to San Diego with so we talked through the all game. He drains him for 2 at Sullust and Hoth. He did not have any sites or systems and he did not want to come to my places. There were no battles and nothing to write about. <br>
<br>
Full win + 6 31  (48)<br>
<br>
<br>
Slops nothing<br>
Prompts for him kill a senate deck. Great idea dude. I love old but unique ideas. Stay cool<br>
Overall like to chat about current deck ideas.<br>
<br>
Well I came in third overall. Got some corusant packs and gave a Dan a tournament foil for his birthday. <br>
1 Dan lujan<br>
2. Jason<br>
3 me<br>
Rest I do not know. Some one grabs the print out and stuffed it on their pockets. <br>
<br>
Slops <br>
1. John for not coming to tournament and drinking without us. Come dude, at least tell me. &amp;#61514;<br>
2. My wattos objective <br>
3. The bar at the Azusa for not selling alcohol to Dan. Come on @#$% heads he is 21. <br>
<br>
Prompts<br>
1. John for letting me sleeps there and hanging out.<br>
2. Dan happy birthday<br>
3. Dan freaking idea, killing my objective  <br>
<br>
Thank you for reading.<br>
