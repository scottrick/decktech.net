place to put it in this report!) So I finally get to bring a buddy of<br>
mine, Levi Buck. He&#146;s played StarWars for awhile, but he stopped a<br>
couple years ago and has never been to a tournament before. We struggled<br>
to build a DS deck a couple weeks ago, and he called me and told me he<br>
wanted LS asteriods, so I build him a simple awing sanctuary deck. I&#146;ve<br>
been wanting to build an awing asteriod deck anyway, so I figure I&#146;ll<br>
let him test it out for me. We finish the LS deck at my house and eat<br>
our pizza, then head over to Shaner&#146;s Outer Rim. Don&#146;t get confused;<br>
it&#146;s the OTHER pink building behind the Whataburger! It&#146;s nice to have a<br>
tournament 5 minutes away instead of a half hour drive. I decide to<br>
change my DS from PalpyOps to a Hunt Down w/ duelling and MAD tracking,<br>
and my LS is a HB fake Mains + Toys with MAD tracking. I&#146;ve been working<br>
on my tracking since I keep miscounting by 1! I need to get better at<br>
that. I have to get Levi back by 11:30, and the games start at 7:00. So<br>
when 7:30 passes by, I&#146;m getting worried. We finally start, and I&#146;m<br>
paired with Robert Seymour, a guy I&#146;ve never played before, but that I<br>
know. Here we go.<br>
<br>
GAME 1: HD vs. Robert&#146;s Tatooine Operatives<br>
<br>
That&#146;s right, he starts the Operative objective with Tatooine. I don&#146;t<br>
know, either. I have no idea what to expect and no clue what effect to<br>
start with. I think I finally wound up with Battle Order, but I don&#146;t<br>
remember. He was kind enough to give me my 6th Force for my first turn,<br>
so Darth Vader visits the DS Docking Bay. He drops EPP Luke, so Vader<br>
needs to take a trip. I pick him up and prepare to drop EPP Vader next<br>
turn instead because I want that boy sliced into little tiny pieces. He<br>
drops EPP Leia and EPP Han, so now I know what the deck is. I drop the<br>
lone EPP Vader anyway and initiate a battle. I play You Are Beaten on<br>
Leia (when Luke&#146;s gone, she can&#146;t drain although Han can). TO NO AVAIL!<br>
Did you know Weapon Lev cancels You Are Beaten? Neither did I. So I<br>
settle for hitting Luke and losing 12 Force. This is what kills me; I<br>
could normally come back with that loss, but I LOSE LORD VADER AND CHOKE<br>
VADER AND DARTH VADER TO THE LOSS!!!!! Yes, that&#146;s 4 Vaders (including<br>
EPP) in one battle. Yeah, that killed me more than anything else. So I&#146;m<br>
holding onto my last Darth Vader (I KNEW I should have put a 6th Vader<br>
in the deck!) knowing that HE CAN&#146;T DIE!!!!! I drop Fett against the<br>
Spiral and Nien Nunb with a 6 tracked, but he barriers Fett. I have 5<br>
Force left and Zuckuss. DRAT! My little army chased Ben around Tatooine,<br>
but I never catch up to him due to the way he placed his sites and<br>
docking bays. He drops Harc Sef with Ben to cancel my drains DRAT! for a<br>
couple turns. Visage eventually does me in. This was a fun, very<br>
interactive game despite the outcome.<br>
<br>
FL by 6<br>
0 (-6)<br>
<br>
PROS: Lots of interaction, good tracking by me, killed Luke at no<br>
expense<br>
CONS: Um, let&#146;s see... how about 4 VADERS!!!!! Playing Tatooine Ops,<br>
losing YAB, Fett getting barriered with a perfect 6, Harc Sef.<br>
<br>
So that was frustrating. I lost to a TatOps deck. I ran out of Vaders in<br>
the first couple turns. I&#146;m ready to avenge myself with my LS mains and<br>
toys deck. But here&#146;s the catch: I have to play Jared. Maybe I&#146;ll wait<br>
until next game to avenge my loss...<br>
<br>
GAME 2: HB vs. Jared&#146;s Bring Him Before Me<br>
<br>
Okay, my starting hand has Luke JK, EPP Luke, EPP Leia, DoS, and some<br>
other scout. I don&#146;t remember who. For the rest of the game, I would<br>
draw no other characters besides Luke and Chewie. I search for Dagobah<br>
first turn; Dagobah is activated. I settle for Endor with Strike<br>
Planning blocking his generation and draw Dagobah. I drop it next turn<br>
and search for Yoda&#146;s Hutt; Yoda&#146;s Hutt is activated. He Twileks for<br>
Search And Destroy, but it never hits the table when he realizes I&#146;m not<br>
playing space. I gave Vader my JK Luke from the deck because I didn&#146;t<br>
have enough Force to do it from my hand. He didn&#146;t drain on the Tat DB,<br>
which was too bad because I had a Lost In The Wilderness with his name<br>
on it. I took out his non-stop onslaught of Walker Fodder, but I died so<br>
often it wasn&#146;t even funny. He caught my first Insertion Planning,<br>
making it impossible for me to track my 6 destinies. He eventually<br>
stacked 7 cards on his Luke turner, but he won every single duel, making<br>
it impossible for him to turn my Jedi. I finally got down to Cracken and<br>
EPP Obi in my hand, but I didn&#146;t have the Force left to do some carnage<br>
in the Throne Room. I can&#146;t lose the duels anymore and he turns Luke<br>
with 3 cards left in my deck.<br>
<br>
FL by 17<br>
0 (-23)<br>
<br>
PROS: Um, maybe, um, well, ahh, um... is it getting hot in here?<br>
CONS: No tracking, drawing crappy destinies to boot, only drawing luke<br>
and chewie, not getting Vader lost, not leaving 2 Force for Insertion<br>
Planning<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was ugly. But Jared&#146;s a good player, and I can still make a<br>
decent showing, right? Well? Am I right? Okay, don&#146;t answer that. I know<br>
I&#146;m scrubbing now. Levi won his second game, so I&#146;m happy for him, that<br>
evil bum. He wants to play a fun game while everyone else is having<br>
pizza, so I break out a DS2 precon and start a game. He freezes Jendon<br>
first turn for a loss of 8 (Honor should be in precons!), and I&#146;m<br>
satisfied to stay on Endor and drain. Anyway, our game gets cut short as<br>
the next round begins.<br>
<br>
GAME 3: HB vs. Stephen&#146;s Tatooine &quot;Sands Of Giants&quot; scenario<br>
<br>
He didn&#146;t have time to build a real DS deck, so he was using the deck<br>
from Scot&#146;s tourney long ago. I tried to remember the deck I had built<br>
for the event, but I couldn&#146;t remember the specifics. I was just<br>
watching out for jawas and tuskens. Luke JK and DoS ran around Tatooine,<br>
avoiding his army. He had a G-Stick, and I can&#146;t use my weapons! I must<br>
find a way to get around this little error in strategy I seem to have<br>
made. Anyway, I&#146;ve got Chewie of Kashyyyk and Gen Solo at the Endor DB<br>
for an easy drain of 1, a destiny draw, and the ability to cancel one.<br>
He drops Lord Vader and Tarkin, and we battle away. He cancels my battle<br>
destiny, and I use Insertion Planning on him to track a 6. He draws a 3,<br>
so I don&#146;t bother to cancel it. I lose a Force, and we all live. Next<br>
turn wipes him inside out. You see, the previous turn I had just drawn<br>
up Draw Their Fire and Frozen Assets. I was planning on having fun with<br>
some assault-less troopers, but this was just too much fun to let pass.<br>
I drop EPP Obi, Tawss, and Wedge to Endor, Clash Vader, Draw some Fire<br>
and Freeze his assets. I initiate a battle (forget to retrieve Clash!),<br>
swing at Tarkin, and draw the infamous 6 (tracked) for destiny. I even<br>
called it. So he loses Tarkin and 22 more. The Grand Moff leaves some<br>
blood stains on Vader&#146;s jacket as he watches from afar, but there is<br>
nothing he can do. He can&#146;t even Ghhhk because of Draw Their Fire and<br>
Frozen Assets.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, a couple Skywalkers are still bouncing around Tatooine. I<br>
finally get a weapon lev and ask Jared for a specific ruling on reacts<br>
and just and who gets first action and all that to make sure I do this<br>
right. Lord Vader paid a visit after being beaten off Endor, so he&#146;s<br>
here, too. I battle, he reacts, and I weapon lev his G-Stick. That&#146;s<br>
nice. And I even remembered to retrieve one this time. I get to use my<br>
sabers! I slice a couple guys, knowing that I don&#146;t have the numbers to<br>
kill the Dark Lord. I lose DoS, and he loses his hit guys plus a cadet<br>
to cancel the rest of it. DRAT! We ran around the planet a little more,<br>
then we battled again. I was trying to wear him down with the drain of 1<br>
on Endor, but it wasn&#146;t working. I realized that my top destinies were<br>
good, but I didn&#146;t know what my third was. I destroy Vader and rip him<br>
limb from limb over and over again, celebrating the evil joy I got from<br>
it (I drew a destiny of 12 for the saber hit). He draws a destiny, and I<br>
draw a 4. I lose Luke and Houjix the rest, he loses Vader and some other<br>
scrub. So I&#146;ve played solidly, made no mistakes I can think of, and used<br>
my strategy and tracking skills to the max. Now I realize that I have 6<br>
cards left, and he has a drain of 6 coming up. What happened? Before I<br>
activate my last turn, I search for a general. Lando isn&#146;t there, but<br>
I&#146;ve got 2 Obi Kenobi&#146;s. I activate it all, drain him for 1, and draw,<br>
hoping I can get something useful. In retrospect, I could have used the<br>
Spiral to react to his drain, but it wouldn&#146;t have mattered. He still<br>
would have killed me with the other drains. It really puzzles me how I<br>
lost this game. I played great, then I just kinda ran out of cards. The<br>
very last card I lost was ironically my last 6.<br>
<br>
FL by 7<br>
0 (-30)<br>
<br>
PROS: Tracking like a mad mother *shut your mouth!* the entire game. I<br>
had the 6 lined up every time I needed it. I&#146;m finally getting better at<br>
this. Someone even commented after I had drawn my 6 for battle destiny<br>
the 7th or 8th time in a row &quot;That guy&#146;s a tracking madman!&quot; I felt good<br>
about that one. Royally raping Tarkin, using my cool Draw Their<br>
Fire/Frozen Assets tech that I learned from the Mega Tourney Saturday<br>
night. Stealing a Gaffi Stick. Using Transmission Terminated to cancel<br>
the Monnok that wanted to eat my 2 Jedi Lukes. Did I mention the Tarkin<br>
battle already?<br>
<br>
CONS: Still managing to lose somehow. I think my mistake was dropping<br>
everyone at Endor and not being able to get them off the planet.<br>
<br>
So that really pisses me off. I was doing great, then I just ran out of<br>
cards. Yeah, it sucks. Whatever. So now I get the bye because I suck so<br>
badly. I watch Levi&#146;s last game. He&#146;s playing his Asteroid Sanc against<br>
someone&#146;s Hunt Down. I played my Hunt Down against his Sanc deck before<br>
we came, and he slaughtered me by nearly 30 points. Sanc really takes a<br>
toll, even if it&#146;s just at 1 system! He manages to destroy his opponent<br>
through a few mistakes, but at the end of the game, asteroids take out<br>
the Avenger, Fett, Zuckuss, and Bossk all in one stroke. Sanc at 3<br>
systems for 4 Force each + drains at the Big Ones + Rebel Fleet +<br>
Undercover Spies = Levi won. So he won both LS games. And he&#146;s never<br>
been to a tournament before. For crying out loud, he only saw the deck<br>
for the first time a couple hours ago! He&#146;s only played it twice, both<br>
against me and my playing style! He came up 4(-40), not bad at all! I<br>
ended with 2(-30) for a 2nd to last place. Levi finished 4th to last,<br>
and Brian Choongphol went undefeated and won the thing. I pull a Liberty<br>
in my prize support, thank the maker that it&#146;s not a TTO, and give it to<br>
Levi. I should have played with the asteroids and given him my HD deck.<br>
I scrubbed out hard. I don&#146;t really know why I&#146;m playing so poorly<br>
lately. I&#146;ve got decent decks, I&#146;m just not doing something right. I was<br>
&quot;borrowing&quot; a modified version of Brian Hunter&#146;s HD deck today, just to<br>
see what other variations on the objective are doing. I&#146;m gonna steal<br>
some other deck ideas while I&#146;m at it just to find another little nitche<br>
that I can call my own. I&#146;ve got ewoks for LS, but I need something for<br>
DS now that PalpyOps is all but retired.<br>
<br>
The Good:<br>
Shaner for holding a tourney a couple minutes from my house!<br>
Shaner for giving unheard of prices on SWCCG stuff. I can&#146;t post it<br>
online, but email me privately if you&#146;re interested in the best prices<br>
in town.<br>
Everyone who came for making it a fun, sanctioned event. Even though I<br>
scrubbed, it was still fun.<br>
Levi for coming and doing incredibly well at his first event.<br>
Me for finally tracking without any mis-counts<br>
<br>
The Bad and The Ugly:<br>
Shaner for having 18 million Outer Rim Scouts that span the entire floor<br>
length of his store. :-P<br>
Jared for catching my tracked 6 destiny card!<br>
Levi for beating me in rankings.<br>
Everyone else who beat me in rankings! ;-)<br>
Me for losing without the aid of mistakes<br>
Me for not having money to spend on product. I used my lunch money for<br>
next week just for the entry fee! Yes, StarWars IS more important than<br>
eating.<br>
<br>
It was a good event, thanks to all who came. See you next time! YJ on<br>
Sat, and Type2 on Sunday, I believe. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=1445"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=1445"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
