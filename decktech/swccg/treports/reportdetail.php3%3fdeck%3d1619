[Pre-tourney]<br>
<br>
Ok, this will be my second tournament in Ohio, going 4-2 and taking second at my first. So I was feeling pretty confident, there was still alot of people I didn’t know there so I was just walking around meeting and greeting and doing some trading.  I buy a pack of R:II to hope and get some stuff I needed (Virago, Vigos, etc) so I’m flipping through and I pull a Lord Vader foil and WB Grand Moff Tarkin, that pack would have kicked @#$% in a Sealed Deck :-) Anyways, James Booker and Jamie Abel called and asked to stall the tournament so we waited about another 20 minutes and then we got started promptly.<br>
<br>
[End of pre-tourney]<br>
<br>
My Current Rating: 1705	<br>
My Dark: Hunt Down Dueler<br>
My Light: Hidden Mains<br>
<br>
Number Of People: 12 ( I think, 2 people dropped)<br>
Coordinator: Roger L. McEldowney<br>
<br>
Game 1 - Light vs. Mike Mason’s [1500?] Court<br>
<br>
Crap. I didn’t playtest against any Court decks and I didn’t know the guy so I didn’t know if he was any good or not. He starts with Power Of The Hutt, Leave Them To Me, and<br>
something else, I don’t remember. First turn he gets down Mighty Jabba to AC and draws some. I deploy Dagobah and Yoda’s Hut from reserve and Home One: Docking Bay with<br>
Insrurrection and Tatooine: Dbay from hand. Drop Orimaarko to the Tatooine Dbay and let him go. He pulls out Ephant from reserve and goes to the Audience Chamber with Jabba. I drain 1, he’s loses Emperor off top, so I don’t think he’s playing Scum. I play Choke on his Ephant Mon and deploy Ben Kenobi and Lando with Vibro Ax to the Chamber. Battle, exclude Mighty Jabba with Lando’s Ax and proceed to beat down Ephant with about 9 for him to lose. His turn EPP Fett comes down to the Pit of Carkoon and Jabba moves over. I start setting up 6’s for destinies with my Traffic Control and drop Order to Engage on him. Put Jedi Luke and his saber at the Pit of Carkoon and move over Ben and Lando. He swallows the 3 from Order to Engage for a long time. In the end I drain him out while retrieving with On The Edges. <br>
<br>
Full Win by 39<br>
<br>
2 (+39)<br>
<br>
Highs: I won.<br>
Lows: Not many. He was a decent player but made a few mistakes.<br>
<br>
Game 2 - Dark vs. Jamie Abel’s [1912] Hidden Base Mains<br>
<br>
I’ve heard of Jamie before and was pretty nervous starting out game. I started my basic duel and Hunt Down stuff and he did the Hidden Base thing with Strike Planning,<br>
Insurrection, and Staging Areas. First thing he does, cancels Visage. I was actually kind of happy because I didn’t have a Vader in my opening draw, plus there’s more Visages. We start getting stuff deployed. He gets out Tatooine, Alderaan, and Cantina. I drop Endor: Docking Bay and Tatooine: Docking Bay. Deploy Lord Vader and his saber and Grand Moff Tarkin to Endor, and transit them over for free. He gets out Mos Eisley and Traffic Control and draws for a while. I moved over to his Cantina to drain and his hand is getting incresingly bigger, I need to be careful. I toss Guri down to the Cantina along with  Janus Greejatus. He comes down with a whole crapload of characters. Ben and<br>
Lando are in there with I think Wedge, Madine, and Cracken. So he battles, I take a swing at Ben, and then play Sniper &amp; Dark Strike to make Ben lost ( I can tell he wasn’t<br>
expecting it) and he misses Tarkin with Lando cause I drew a 6. He then runs to the docking bay. Vader and Tarkin pursue during my turn and meet up with Dr Evazan. He deploys the Falcon and General Solo, then brings everyone up to the system. He then runs over to Alderaan to retrieve like 7 with Our Most Desperate Hour....yipee. So now I’m<br>
draining 3 at the Cantina with Mara, Xizor, and draining 2 at the docking bay with Vader, Tarkin, and Dr. E, he deploys Jedi Luke with saber to Mos Eisley then lands the Falcon and every hops out and joins Luke. Beginning of my turn I Monnok to see if he has any dueling cards, which he does, Glancing Blow, but I have Tarkin, and my destinies are<br>
tracked, well, I couldn’t track high ones, but they were decent. I move over, he then plays Glancing Blow to reduce Vader’s power....huh? That cost him the game, I proceed to<br>
play Vader’s Obsession followed by a Focused Attack.....he draws a 2 and a 3 to my 4 4 6....my 20 to his 16 (I just count Luke’s  +3 for the Light total). He then crosses Luke to the dark side, loses 6, we finish the battle with him winning it by 2. He moves his people away and takes off in the Falcon. Then I drain for 4 and 3. Drop Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Bossk in Hounds Tooth on General Solo and his crew of passengers, he doesn’t have enough ability piloting so I out power him by about 8 or so and he loses Solo. He then lands the Falcon. Does the, beats up the people in the Cantina for a couple, and then ship Zuckuss over to Alderaan and proceed to drain him out. Damn good game.<br>
<br>
Full Win by 9<br>
<br>
4 (+48)<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing a GREAT game against a GREAT player.<br>
Lows: Not having duel cards fast enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 - Dark vs. Blair Franklin’s [1637]  Profit<br>
<br>
Blair is a really good player. His rating almost broke 2000 before he went to all the summer conventions and lost most of his points. He starts his Profit stuff with General<br>
Solo at the Audience Chamber and Scrambled Transmission and some other effects. I get a force at the Audience Chamber and nailed him for 2 Jedi Lukes and 2 Owen/Beru combo cards third turn. Then he deploys like Tawss, Artoo &amp; Threepio, Ben, and EPP Leia, we battle back and forth, and I can’t find my duel cards at all. Not to mention Vader hardly hit the table. We drain and battle alot back and forth, I eventually win a duel against Luke and he loses the 18. Then out of nowhere he drops Beru and Lars combo and Tawss then starts Harvesting like crazy.<br>
<br>
Full Loss by ??? (something in the -teens)<br>
<br>
Highs: Bringing Luke home to Daddy. Playing a fairly even game.<br>
Lows: Losing.<br>
<br>
4(+??)<br>
<br>
Game 4 - Light vs. Jamie Abel’s [1912] Endor Ops <br>
<br>
Oh....yay...Jamie again....sucks. He starts his Endor Ops stuff, then Power Of The Hutt and 2 other effects. We start drawing for the first couple of turns and I get my DBays out<br>
and all that stuff. Then I realized, hey, my hand sucks, and his probably kicks ass. So I play Sense &amp; Recoil In Fear and we both draw a new hand. I think I kinda caught him off guard with that. His turn he pulls Ephant to the Bunker and Merrejk too and starts getting systems out. I drop Jedi Luke and his saber to Home One: Dbay for 5 and move to Tatooine, he is followed closely by U-3PO. I’m now starting to track 6’s around to start my retrieval and for the Super Falcon. He puts Chiraneu on a Death Squadron Star<br>
Destroyer and Motti also joins them, followed by Dengar in Punishing One. Right now I control an Endor site so he can’t play Omnious Rumors. He’s draining for 2 in space to<br>
my occasional 1. I’m still drawing like mad looking for the Falcon, but I get something better, Choke. He draws on his next turn. My turn I play Choke on Ephant Mon (cancel<br>
his Game Text), drop Lando with Vibro Ax, Corran Horn, and Mirax Terrik to the Bunker. Battle, exclude Merrejk and make him lose about 6 cards more.  Ben moves over to the Endor: Dbay and meets up with Luke. He deploys Tempest 1 with Sarkli and some other pilot. Lord Vader outside and moves over Merrejk and he gets on. He finally gets Omnious Rumors set up and I’m being hit for 5. I finally get the Super Falcon but I lost Order to Engage off my reserve deck. He drops a lone Fett In Slave 1 to Endor and is met<br>
with the Super Falcon and gets a Barrier. He battles at the Endor: Dbay and I smush Lord Vader (without his saber, mind you) with a tracked 6, that was intended for the Falcon’s<br>
use. So I out power him by about 7, but his scrubs cover it. He played I Have You Now before Vader got squished so he got 3 destiny, all were 1 1 1, but he was saying 5 cause<br>
of There Is No Try &amp; Oppressive Enforcement, but I told him they took the +1 to Starships destiny part out, so I lost nothing. For a while we drain back and forth a bit, mostly him though. Super Falcon meets up with Dengar and the Star Destroyer. He Lateral Damages the Falcon but doesn’t battle. I move over, cancel Lat Damage and go back, he plays Imperial Command so I can’t draw more than 1, damn. So I have to lost the Falcon. I’m still running around on the ground draining and retrieving but eventually he gets me.<br>
<br>
Full Loss By 12<br>
<br>
<br>
Highs: Not a bad game.<br>
Lows: Not getting the Falcon fast enough.<br>
<br>
4(+??)<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5 - Dark vs. Chris Mason’s [1500?] Profit<br>
<br>
What a surprise, another Profit using Artoo &amp; Threepio that my Hunt Down is going to tear a new one. I start with Mara and Xizor in the Audience Chamber. He cancels Visage, hehe, oh well. I start putting people in the AC. Guri, Janus, and Sim. I start tracking with Janus and setting up my dueling destinies. He drops Ben and battles. Hahaha. Circle,<br>
Focused Attack. He draws a 1 and 1 so there’s no need to cancel. I draw a 6 5 1 and Ben bites it plus 9 cards. He battles with Artoo I have a Bad Feeling about this, but I cancel his destiny and were pretty even. He runs over to JP and goes for the Cantina. He can’t drain where Leia is so all he’s doing is Profit Damage. I make it over there, slice Han, operate, he flips back and I beat him badly. 	<br>
<br>
Full Win By 11<br>
<br>
6 (+??)<br>
<br>
Highs: Haven’t lost a duel all day....<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6 - Light vs. Brandon Jones’ [1628] Raltiir Operations<br>
<br>
Hahaha. Haven’t seen this deck in a while. But between my drains and retrieval I should have this in the bag. He starts setting up his sites while Jedi Luke and his saber are steadily pinging him for 2 at the Tatooine: Dbay. He deploys Wampa Cave and North Ridge to set up Imperial Decree, but down comes Lando With Ax and Chewbacca,<br>
Protector and I exclude David Jon and beat up Sarkli for like 8 cards extra. He sets up Janus, Emperor, and Sim. Gets a AT ST Pilot to Blizzard 1 and draws for a while. Corran Horn and Captain Han fly to Raltiir in the Falcon and prevent his flip, next turn he’s joined by EPP Leia and they land to fight the Emperor. Mara comes down and Corran is now power 5. He battles and Leia misses the Emperor by 1 with her rifle. We stay even and eventually I lose Corran and move over to face the AT ST. He doesn’t battle, so I<br>
deploy Ben and saber to Tatooine, deploy Order to Engage, and move Luke to Cloud City:Dbay and I start retrieving like a mad man. I drain him out.<br>
<br>
Full Win By 20<br>
<br>
8 (+52)<br>
<br>
Highs: I beat a RalOps deck, woohoo :-P<br>
Lows. Having Lando chased around by DVDLOTS and saber<br>
<br>
<br>

Well folks, that’s it for my 2nd tournament in Ohio since I moved here. The competition is really tough and I’m surprised I did as well as I did. There will be a Closed<br>
Environment tourney next week, but I don’t think I will write a TR for that. <br>
<br>
Thanks for reading.<br>
