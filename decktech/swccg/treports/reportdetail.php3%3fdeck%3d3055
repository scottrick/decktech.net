Anyway before this tournament i only had time to change one of my decks, so i decided to change my dark. So now i&#146;m playing;<br>
DARK - BHBM Big blue (why not i thought, i&#146;ve never had a chance to play BHBM in a tournament)<br>
LIGHT - HB Flip, close to the great I&#146;m Sick of Hunt Down Racing.<br>
<br>
GAME 1. My Light VS Tyng Yann&#146;s Watto Deck<br>
I start with Strike Planning, Squadron Assignments (set start) and YISYW as a choice to pull Honor. First turn he pulls Watto and plays Yade M&#146;rak to flip, puts one back (i lose two), moves Yade over. Before my turn starts i lose YISYW to pull Honor. My turn and i play Honor, Endor from hand, deploy GS1 with Lando, deploy EP 1 Tatooine and move there, saving 1 force for the Barrier i had in hand. <br>
  He drains, i play It&#146;s A Hit, he tries to sense but he draws too high (he needed a 1). He puts one back after deploying Gardula, i choose two lose two (Honor saves me). He Accelerates for the flagship bridge, and i was suprised, since i expected No Escape. <br>
  Basically they were his only locations for the game. I played projection on the Junkyard and he played presence, so until i flipped i copped a drain of 1 there, and Boushh went down to Mos Espa and was never challenged. <br>
  He never had Honor, and only for 2 turns did he satisfy Honor by playing the DS2 Executor which i killed with Wedge and Kier. No more ships came to space, and i only battled him on the ground with EPP Luke once. He was drained out.<br>
FW +12 or 14. Not sure.<br>
The good; Tyng is one of the best players there and he normally wins, so i was happy to win for a change.<br>
The bad; He didn&#146;t play No Escape, and his ships never saw light<br>
The ugly; This is going to go for a while. After the game he comments to Matt that he&#146;ll fall asleep if he plays me, i mention that i actually initiated a battle on the ground, and he never initiated in space. He tells me i shouldn&#146;t have played a deck that relies on Honor so much, and complains that he&#146;s &quot;seen or heard about my decks lately&quot; because he hasn&#146;t versed me since the states and that they are all so non-interative. I can play whatever cards i want, and if he complains because he doesnt play No Escape (in a non-interactive Wattor deck, apart from the Executor he never occupied anything other than the Junkyard or Mos Espa) then it&#146;s not my fault. I don&#146;t complain when i lose to him, instead i think of why i lost. It&#146;s just a game.<br>
<br>
Now that the ugliness was out of the way..<br>
<br>
GAME 2 My Dark VS EE-Long Chu&#146;s (i think it was him, sorry!) Dantooine Ops.<br>
Took me off guard all right!<br>
Anyway, first turn usual setup, IAO/SP, YCHF/MP and Crush. He plays BP/DTF (argh) and 2 others. First turn usual setup, get the Bridge out (i overkilled on the Accelerates), Palpatine to the Endor DB. Basically i deployed Arica to one of his sites, U-3PO to another, and Vader at the other (DLOTS with Saber). He comes down with Obi Wan (Premiere) and battles. I circle, but he senses it (i didnt have a sense), just miss, and draw bad destiny, he draws his only Luke! (Rebel Scout, i cringe at having to capture him). Obi goes down next turn, and i start draining for 2 at Fondor and 2 at Dantooine. We decide to end the game in style, Vader moves over. During his control phase Arica breaks to hit Chewie, he battles with Corran Horn, Lando (CC) and someone else. Lando is choked, the other two hit... <br>
FW By 24(or abouts)<br>
The good; Good guy trying something different (Dantooine - who expects it?)<br>
The bad; My force generation was insane, more than double his...<br>
<br>
GAME 3 My Light VS Matt Mohl&#146;s AOTBS<br>
It seems this matchup comes up each time. Last time he lost, so he prepared a bit more (as did i). I started with DDTA as my additional effect, and he had security precautions waiting ready for me in his deck.<br>
After a few turns (he kept saving force for those turns while i got 2 drains off) he comes down on GS1 with Zuckuss, 4-Lom, Bossk and Lat Damage. He draws big, but luckily i had Houjix. I never get the forest tech working (immune to attrition chars) and he plays security precautions when he starts probing. Honor was plonked by No Escape, so i was eating that damage. After running down the space line (Endor to Kiffex) he probes correctly on the last planet Kiffex (just like last time, so unlucky :-) ) and he knows he will outrun me, so his ships keep running and i lose to damage and drains.<br>
FL by 2<br>
The good; I love playing Matt, it always seems to come up. He played really well, and he&#146;s a good guy. But you can be certain he&#146;ll play black sun :) Also, drawing It Could Be Worse just before he successfully probes<br>
The bad; Getting the probe right on the last try... AGAIN<br>
<br>
GAME 4 My Dark VS Jared Brown&#146;s QMC.<br>
I reaaaallly really worried when i saw this matchup, as i wasn&#146;t sure if he would play the CC DB. If he didn&#146;t then i had no way to bring Luke back. Fortunately he did. I activated like a maniac and got some star destroyers out quickly. His BP/DTF slowed him at first, but he eventually set up and got menace fades into operation. This couldnt be, so i moved my crew to Bespin from Kashyyk (2 DSSD, Thrawn, Chiranue, Bossk) and lat damaged Wedge (who was at Bespin with Luke in R5). <br>
   Eventually it came time to battle at Bespin (by now i had Executor and Merrejk aswell). He pivoted the Executor, used the Outrider to reduced the power of one DSSD. I won the battle by 9 and lost Merrejk, he had to lose more, so after that it was just a running game. I was able to spread my forces between Bespin and Kashyyk, so Menace Fades didnt work. Arica blocked a drain at the chamber for a while but he still got a few Pucumir Drains through.<br>
   It was clinched when he landed Luke at the DB with Pucumir, and i came down with Vader (DLOTS vs Pucumir = Not good). We moved to the Throne Room for a few duels, and that was it..<br>
<br>
FW by 12<br>
The good; he had a GREAT QMC deck, but he was really unlucky, he attempted to alter lat damage, but i had my lone sense in hand at the time.<br>
The bad; menace fades shreds space drain decks<br>
<br>
GAME 5 My Dark VS Clarrie Brown&#146;s Profit.<br>
Clarrie and Jared are a force to be reckoned with, both are among the best we have here. I deployed the emperor to the aud chamber (arica started there as an undercover). His first turn he comes down with Master Luke (with saber)AND Ben Kenobi. He battles (i say @#$%). fortunately he didnt have gift of the mentor, he hits Palpatine, i play i have you now and i win the battle by 1! (i draw a 5,4 and 1). Everything is cleared out and i stack one under insignificant. <br>
   Next turn i play No Escape and get Palpy back, and soon he comes down with Lando w/axe, Leia w/gun and someone else (can&#146;t remember). I fried Lando, Leia missed, but Palpy died in attrition (i have a second). Once his lost hits 10 he rescues Han and spreads out to his docking bays. This is where it gets funny. Leia is by herself at JP and i have Lord Vader, i think sweet. Battle, FALLEN PORTAL! And i didnt have They&#146;re Still Coming Through in hand, Vader is crushed.<br>
   My spies are blocking his drains, but im still getting pinged for 2/3. However, i have Kashyyk and Fondor bunkered up, and my Spaceport DB is on one of them with Emperor and Janus. At this stage im dealing more than i&#146;m receiving. <br>
   Always a fan of letting history repeat itself, Choke Vader with Saber comes down to kill lone Leia, and wouldnt you have it, fallen portal hits it&#146;s target.<br>
   Down comes Corran Horn, who breaks U-3P0&#146;s cover, then moves to break Arica&#146;s Cover next turn. He does, so i move Arica to Endor:DB. His turn, out comes Master Luke from reserve deck and a saber to hack Arica. We both lose them. He sees my hand is down, so he spreads out. <br>
<br>
FL by 6 (and i was getting him for 8 a turn! argh)<br>
The good; Close to beating Clarrie... Close :)<br>
The bad; Not what you&#146;d think, thats the ugly...<br>
The ugly; Vader gets fallen portalled twice!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
GAME 6 My light VS Ee-Ling Chu&#146;s BHBM<br>
He started with Combat Responce, Battle Order, and We Shall DOuble Our Efforts.... WHAAAT!!!<br>
Anyway, it started off slow on his part, but Battle Order definately slowed my down until about turn 4 when i deployed the &lt;&gt;forest with Luke from reserve. It appeared that he was pulling the DS2 sectors into hand using Moff Jerryjod. He had nothing on the table (except Palp, Janus and Jerryjod) by the time i flipped, and then out of nowhere on his turn, DS2, all the sectors, Sullust, 2 Ties (matching with cannons) That things operational, 2 &lt;&gt; sites, he uses elis to move his chars over (no its a hit in my hand) so he occupies two of the locals (thats 2 drain damage that i can cancel, but 5 from that thing&#146;s op). i manage to play it could be worse twice, and he was outdrained in the end.<br>
<br>
FW by 20ish????<br>
<br>
The good; Drawing It COuld be Worse when it&#146;s needed. Ee-Ling trying something original.<br>
The bad; Having no idea what was going on (though i had my guesses) when i see We Shall Double Our Efforts. <br>
<br>
So in the end it was like this;<br>
Clarrie Brown<br>
Jared Brown<br>
Me<br>
Tyng Yann Yen.<br>
<br>
The good; Rob for running good tourneys (and putting up alot of sh#t from us when we complain about not getting Maul&#146;s and Qui-Gon&#146;s in our prize support packets). Clarrie for winning it (dont you get tired of winning Clarrie?) BHBM for taking people off guard. <br>
<br>
The bad; I think i outlined this at the start. I&#146;ve lost to you plenty of times mate, and i don&#146;t complain. You&#146;ve played plently of non-interactive decks (ie Pile; and claiming you just happened to have the same idea at the same time) and you will do so again in the future. There is only so much you can play... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=3055"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=3055"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
