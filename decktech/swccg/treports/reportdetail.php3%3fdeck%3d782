Woke up to find it raining pretty heavy(possible reason why neither of them showed up-or they went to Ottawa), so I left myself plenty of time.  I played the same two decks I had at RamapoConII, LS HB/OMDH/tat mains and DS Huntdown no duel.  I know they're good decks, but I should have looked through them again before I played because the DS didn't have 2 cards I thought it did-Secret Plans and Pol Treidum, Secret Plans might have helped in 1 game and Pol Treidum would have won me a game much quicker.  We had 14 players there-myself, John Lolli, Mike Dalton, Kim Caton being the top rated players and a couple of guys from Clarks Summit PA drove out to play.<br>
<br>
Game 1 LS vs Joseph Gagliardi's (1726) Raithal Ops/Numbers<br>
	For some reason this deck seems to be getting popular.  I built 1 a month ago and really didn't like it.  I had a good version when endor first came out, but I don't think it works to well anymore.  So I start Ultimatum and hope I can get 3 battlegrounds quickly cause I know he'll occupy 1.  First turn he drops 3 cadets and inserts.  I have EPP luke and tawss khaa in hand.  I pull tatooine and say go.  He adds another cadet.  I deploy EPP Luke and tawss, battle and he trooper assualts, I sense, but he has another.  I predict he wins, swing and draw a 3.  He draws a 3.  I retrieve, lose tawss, he loses the cadet I hit and 2 others to cover the 3(guess he didn't remember it made them immune to attrition as well-I wasn't going to tell him).  He moved around raithal after that, setting up drains on the far ends of the planet.  I had Luke in the middle, the Tantive with Wedge and RLR1 at Raithal draining, and began dropping ability 4 characters to fight his guys and squeeze him.  Orrimaarko was huge since he had imperials at every site.  I retrieved 3 times with OMDH to lock  up the game.  His numbers popped 3 times, but after the first did 8 damage I got ultimatum set up.  Unfortunately I couldn't find Leia or Han to go battle with so the game went longer than I thought.  FW +7<br>
Highlights:beating trooper numbers with only ultimatum for # protection<br>
lowlights:never finding EPP leia to go shooting troopers.<br>
<br>
Game 2 DS vs Kim Caton's (1871) MWYHL/Lockdown<br>
	The whole point of Kim's deck is to train luke with test 1, use undercover spies and landing claws to block most of your drains, and then use arconas with order to engage to make you lose force.  She also has the holotable in with projections to drain at.  I get Vader down second turn and flip.  She flipped Test 1 to Visage at the end of her first turn since she needed everything in hand.  I got two drains on endor set up, then she dropped boussh and artoo undercover.  I Look sir droids, she droid shutdowns to cancel.  I got my other two sites out and the endor system, she landing clawed the system and dropped a bothan spy to 1 site.  Bubo came down and ate him so I had two drains going.  She got a Projection to the holotable, I used Image of the Dark Lord and battled taking away her only drain.  The arconas got monnoked out early, and I was able to Alter Hiding in the Garbage by drawing a 1.  She kept using it could be worse, so I started drawing for my it's worse.  Finally got it near end game and was able to use it and boost the drain of 1 up to 10, that was all she wrote.  FW +18  4(+25)<br>
Highlights:using it's worse<br>
lowlights:not having Pol Treidum in my deck.<br>
<br>
Game 3 LS vs Luis Rodriguez's(1626) Huntdown/Duel<br>
	Luis was just playing with a bunch of docking bays to follow my mains wherever I went.  He put Vader and Mara down on Endor.  I got Ben to Tatooine and just held Luke, I also got Jeroen Webb and Melas to executor.  He got both there sabers and presenced the endor DB, I dropped Boussh.  He got out the tat db and started to come after ben.  First attempt was 2 biker scouts, davin felth and a trooper assualt, not enough to kill Ben since he drew a 3 and I drew a 6.  Ben kept doing the flip-flop on tatooine while I drained at the system and waited for my opening.  I set up retrieval and used OMDH a few times to get plenty of force back.  Finally I dropped Luke, Han, and wedge and battled some guys, did some damage.  Then I got Vader with Lost in the Wilderness.  Mara finally moved to luke and was able to duel, I gave him luke and lost 5, then retrieved them and more.  We were draining evenly, but my retrieval kept me in the game.  Fw by 15  6(+40)<br>
<br>
Game 4 DS vs Michael Dalton's (2069) HB/OMDH/Tat Mains/Superfalcon<br>
	Mike and I were the only undefeateds at this point.  I was surprised by the start since I figured he would be playing his MWYHL Superfalcon deck.  I soon realized he was playing superfalcon, just a different way.  I got Vader down early and Visage hurt him a few turns.  He threw Ben on tatooine, but he got Always thinking to make him missing.  MY MISTAKE IN THE GAME-before he searched for ben I forgot to Alter Savrip, he found ben and flipped the objective back and I would not be able to kill ben.  I picked vader off endor, and next turn deployed Choke Vader with saber and tempest 1 to fight ben, luke, tawss, and orrimaarko.  I you are beatened luke and look at my destinies(6,4,3,1)  I swing at ben and miss(4,1) so I choke orrimaarko(6)and draw the 3.  He revives tawss and then on his turn moves into the cantina.  I lost the tempest so Vader was chilling with Luke.  I tried to take down Captain Han in Falcon with EPP Leia with Zuckuss in MH and BUS, but I beat him in total power by 1, so he savriped the attrition.  After that I really was able to hang in space and Zuckuss kept running.  couldn't find my other ships, but it wouldn't have mattered with savrip out(also couldn't find masterful move).  He kept retreiving 11(luke, ben, leia, yoda, tawss, han) and I couldn't stop it(SECRET PLANS)  loss by 21.   6(+19)<br>
<br>
Game 5 DS vs Joseph Gagliardi's (1726) Hidden Base deck<br>
	Joe was playing straight-up hidden base, but no undercover spies.  he had rebel fleet and it's a hits, but rebel fleet got flipped due to huntdown turn 2.  I got Vader down on Endor and flipped, and then had Mara at the Back Door(hmmm)  He got out 5 systems and flipped.  I drew to get my ships, found BUS and Fett.  He was draining at kessel and kiffex and had bespin, kashyyk and yavin 4 out.  I knew kashyyk was out since he I monnoked and he had 1 in had and the 1 on table(must be a backup so he could switch).  I deployed fett to kessel and probed-nope.  Now I was thinking either deploy BUS and battle at kessel to try to clear his drain(i had a 6 on top, but he had Lando in Falcon, Wedge and a Gold x-wing)  didn't know what the other destiny was, so I deployed fett to bespin and probed-BINGO, then I moved fett to the BUS.  He added GLinG1 and battled, i drew a 6 and 4. I just had to lose the bus.  I threw dengar as a passenger and battled again and drew my tracked 6(he drew a 1, so I just lost a couple of cards-dengar was just in case he drew a 4 so I didn't have to lose too many)  He kept cancelling visage with spies and a terminated, but then I would just battle with first strike and retrieve it, and then masterful move for it.  He couldn't keep up and now that I had the objective gone and my drains back it was inevitable.  win by 15  8(+34)<br>
<br>
Game 6 LS vs Michael Dalton's (2069) Huntdown <br>
	John Lolli and I were both 4-1 and Mike was 5-0.  John and Mike were both DS so I got to play Mike again.  I've never lost to Mike twice in the same day-at least not that I can recall.  If we play twice, we split.  Back in March just before states we played twice and both our LS won.  I knew what he had basically and I thought I had a good match-up if I could just not screw up.  He gets Vader down to the CC Docking bay.  I drop jeroen webb and tawss to executor and cancel visage, he drops Come hear you big coward.  I get boussh to CC and Ben to mos eisely.  He drops Mara and Dr E, pulls saber and battles.  swing 5,1 destiny 4.  I draw a 3.  ben lives and he can only lose 1, so E dies.  I drop EPP Luke and Han with Romas Lock for the hell of it, battle swing-hit, and draw a 6,5.  he hit Ben and drew a 6, so ben and han die, but he loses Mara and 15 force.  I have Luke romas left, not a great idea in hindsight.  He tracks back to the 6, drops Iggy, captures luke and i lose Lock and a 3 cards.  He moves Vader to DS docking bay-i'm content to leave him there because of put all sections.  I break boussh's cover, have 2 ships at tatooine, so I have 2 drains and occupy two battlegrounds.  I can drain on the executor and am able to pull of an OMDH for a few.  I play OOC against his good size lost pile that has 3 vaders in it and grab him, so now all I have to do is kill the one on the table.  Mike moves vader to boussh and adds Evazan(choke vader with saber).  My only hope is he doesn't have a barrier.  I drop melas and boshek to boussh-no barrier.  battle, boussh and melas dies from saber and choke, but I draw the tracked 5 and kill Vader off.  I was able to retrieve twice more to give me the edge at the end.  win by 9<br>
10(+43)<br>
<br>
I finish 5-1, so do Mike and John.  Mike's dif is the highest so he wins his T-shirt back, and John takes 2nd.  I really don't care about places, I'm just happy with the 5-1.  I haven't faired that well in the last two months and was starting to think I had lost my game.  Guess not, just had some bad luck.  Regionals are in 4 weeks and I'll need to find a rabbit's foot for luck before then.  I don't have any bright dreams about winning, I just want to win some games against the dozen of 2000 rated players in the region(Dan Sokol counts-he was there and is still close)<br>
