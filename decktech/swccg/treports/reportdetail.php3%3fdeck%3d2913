This was done on word so I am sorry for the tags. Anyway, the tournament happened on September first. Well here is some pre-tournament junk.<br>
<br>
Curscant came out and I made some crappy decks (senate decks) and played against my bro before he left for college. Anyway I played and I lost but we liked the mains part of the decks. So I made a maul mains and a hyperdrive. So we played the day before he left and my maul mains was ok. My bro leaves for college and now I have 2 weeks till the tournament and I have no experience with curscant. So I have don&amp;#8217;t do anything for a week and have Steve Baroni come over to play test. I play with maul mains and we split. I play with my hyperdrive and we split. Ok. So on Monday Jared comes over on the way back from work so we can make a trade. We play a game, I&amp;#8217;m playing my maul mains against my hyperdrive. I beat him by 30 cause I flip in like 3-4 turns and then I just own. So anyway I hear about Bastian winning so try to get his deck, I can&amp;#8217;t so I just make my own watto deck. I use the shaft and AT-ST&amp;#8217;s with tramples instead of his racing and all the missing stuff. I play it against the wys solid I made and well it creamed it both times. So that was good, I still couldn&amp;#8217;t come up with a good light deck and so I remade my wys beats but every time I shuffled the deck and drew a hand in a gold fish game, the deck didn&amp;#8217;t seem right. So the day before I decided on my hyperdrive and my watto deck. I made a few changes once I saw decklists of watto decks and I but in more stay here where it&amp;#8217;s safe with my hyperdrive. The day of the tournament I wake up and watch card captors (I like anime and the new season is decent) then shower and get packed. I then watch the hour long season premiere of the third season of Digimon. It looks ok, actually it looks like the best Digimon yet. Meaning the kids aren&amp;#8217;t as big of re-re&amp;#8217;s as they where and the Digimon themselves aren&amp;#8217;t as cute and more bad ass. If you even think about rating this less stars because of this mention of Digimon you can suck my left nut, I don&amp;#8217;t have cable and I need anime, no matter how bad! Oh why did Escaflowne stop being aired! WHY!!! Um yes, well I get there at 11:40 and we start tournament.<br>
<br>
Decks<br>
Light-hyperdrive<br>
Dark- watto shaft (roc/much anger) and tramples.<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs some dude.<br>
He is playing mains, starting the home 1 docking bay. I flip first turn and make him lose 2 force. I also got the bridge out along with my other 2 db&amp;#8217;s. A good start. He just gets out db&amp;#8217;s and draws. I activate and drain, he says u need to drain first then activate. I just tell him you activate then drain, he just says ok and we play on. I drain for 1 cause battle plan is out and I do 2 with my objective I just pick up waiting for him to make a move. Well his move is deploying DOS to the Endor db then moving her to the home 1 db. He also gets out order to engage so my shaft is basically useless.  So anyway her has lost like 20 in like 6 turns and I have the beats all set up waiting to happen. Unfortunate for me, he keeps qui-gon and obi-wan (both with sticks) together. But I do make an attempt to beat them up and I take out obi wan and DOS cause of Dr. E and Ponda Boba and epp Vader.  I also had some walkers and I think maul there. But anyway he tries to get something going with his mains but I just beat them down, clear the board and I win easy. FW by 30.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning and my deck working.<br>
Lows: order to engage.<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. Ross litatuer<br>
He is playing huntdown jizz, so dueling and no pod racing. He gets to my junkyard 2nd turn, my goo ney tay slowed him down. However I got not locations in my starting hand and I got only 1 character. So I had to draw up. I got 1 location and like 4 characters. So I try to get the junkyard with a qui-gon. But maul comes down and I have to lose 15 or qui-gon and 15. I drew a 0.From there I just cancel visage with jar jar and ric Ollie. I flip him back with new obi and a few attempts at the junkyard are made, me taking out Vader only though. He just drains me out and I lose. After taking a yab beating. Fl by 13?<br>
<br>
Highs: jar jar canceled visage<br>
Lows: losing, his deck was too much, and my deck should have been better.<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs. Steve Brentson<br>
He is playing bhbm. He gets out emperor and stuff so he will activate a ton next turn. I put out a twix and 2 dudes to the junkyard to activate more. The 2 dudes where mas Amada and another senator. He comes down with a walker and 2 dudes. We tie in power and I lose 1 guy he loses 1 guy. My turn I activate 11 and play jpsd Lando and another person and battle. I draw low but I still make him stack a card. He is draining with emperor and activating like 12 a turn. We are battling it out in the junkyard with us talking turns stacking. Finally he has iggy, veers, and a Mara. I weapon levitate the saber. He captures panaka (he shot tempest 1 earlier) I hit veers. He adds a destiny I get 2 and he gets 1. I win and he loses both and 4 he stacks his 3rd card and he moves Mara away. I activate drain and flip. Then I play Lando and another dude to take out Mara. I retrieve 2 from dtf and my objective, I would have got 3, but he had secret plans. So anyway we are just draining and I am doing hit and runs with my senators I battle retrieve 1, then I win making him lose a dude and I retrieve a guy into hand with my objective. Eventually I just drain him out. FW by 23.<br>
<br>
Highs: my deck working.<br>
Lows: none.<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs. ric Gaudioso<br>
He is playing wys.  I flip first turn with Janus and I do 2 damage. I draw up, leaving no force. On his turn I activate one with wipe them out, all of them which I start (oh yeah I started that, iao/secret plans, and the new grabber). I am bluffing the barrier and he falls for it. He doesn&amp;#8217;t know what to do first turn so he just places watto in used pile. I Janus on his turn. Then I go. I activate and drain then play watto from hand and do 2 damage. I then play tempest scout 4 to join Janus and the deploy 0 guy from curoscant to join watto. He goes and plays Jedi Luke and saber to Janus&amp;#8217;s location. I bluffed a barrier and so I just Janus and he battles. I draw high so I just lose both no overflow and it&amp;#8217;s my turn. I drain then let him go. He drains and I lost in the wilderness and make Luke missing. He then just draws or deploys in space. I activate drain then flip again with Brangus and do 2. He activate and attempts to beat down Brangus but I barrier 2 of his guys. My turn I accelerate to complete the shaft in my hand. I play maul to his location along with a AT-ST. I thought his ability would be 0 but I forgot he had the docking bay chick there. His turn he gets back Luke and we battle he just loses a guy and I lose maul. I then play the shaft on Luke and do 2 to him and let him go. The shaft hits him for 4 and he moves Luke to Watto&amp;#8217;s location so he can try and beat me down. My turn epp Vader and dr.e and Ponda make an appearance. He has ecc Chewie, a 2/2 smuggler, and ecc Lando. I trample Chewie. Battle hit Lando and immediately operate. Then I beat the remaining guy up for 17 overflow. That&amp;#8217;s game. FW by 26.<br>
<br>
Highs: my deck is a beast.<br>
Lows: ric must have stated how retarded my deck was 15 times. How come all my decks are retarded ric?<br>
<br>
After this game we go wendy&amp;#8217;s. Mike Gemme drives, Justin called shotgun so it&amp;#8217;s me and ten numb in the back. We listen to my brothers fear factory CD that he left in mikes car. Which I also forgot. But then we get there and everyone else is retarded and orders a combo meal. I however go up look up at the 99-cent value menu and bam! Chicken nuggets, jr. bacon cheeseburger, medium coke, and medium fries. The words where but a whisper but the entire Wendy&amp;#8217;s heard. I then walked away with my meal and leaving the line with the word domination.<br>
<br>
Game 5 Vs Justin Desai.<br>
He is playing wys, good. He told me earlier that Bastian told him how to beat watto. So he starts battle order. I flip first turn and I do 2. Then I let him go after drawing up, leaving 1 though. I activate 1 on his turn. He just draws up and I go. I drain for 1 then do 2. I leave 1 force after playing zukuss to space. He plays tunnel, which I grab. And then he flips does something I don&amp;#8217;t remember. What happens is that I am draining and he doing watto damage. He goes to space and I play zixor on Zuckuss and let him go. He battles with Mirax in ship, captain Han and wedge in the falcon. I just lose my guys and I think he may have had another dude on board he lost. But then he plays legendary. On my turn I drain then get to play Vader for free to his cantina. He gets out Kessel and he is doing 5 with legendary and I am doing 4 in drains. Eventually I get a free executor after janusing forever and I shaft wedge for 1 turn. He loses 4 but gets it back with an on the edge. He has to land the falcon so he does and moves wedge to the home 1 db. Then moves his other ship over to the executor to stop a drain of 2.  My turn I drain for 4 and do 3. Then a walker goes in front of Han and I trample him. I move the executor while drawing for Arica. He drains for 1 then puts Luke in front of my Janus. I barrier. I then drain and deploy p-59 and a walker to beat up Luke. I kill Luke and do 2 from p-59 and 3 from overflow. He has 1 card left. I win next turn. FW by 9<br>
<br>
Highs: my deck beating wys like it&amp;#8217;s supposed to. He never went to the ground cause of my tramples and mains.<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
So now I am in first by 8 diff. I play against Mike Gemme the winner of that would prolly win the tournament. However I would have to win by no less then 11 diff worse then Justin and mike would have to win with 3 diff worse then Justin. I hope that made sense.<br>
<br>
Game 6 vs. Mike Gemme<br>
He is playing lotti dodi. In play testing Steve beat me with it by 1 card. But now I have some stuff for his deck. Basically he can&amp;#8217;t set up much anger because I have no rebels. So he had no way of damage beyond the senate drain, yeb yeb, and limited recourse. So basically it takes me a while to get panaka with blaster to the junkyard to snipe his dude. And when I did he grabbed it but he lost 2 from panaka&amp;#8217;s game text. I finally flip and he tries to beat me down with maul I barrier. I activate enough to use dtf and retrieve 3 more because he had secret plans. I have jpsd Lando and new obi and naked droid. I battle retrieve one, I then attempt to exclude I fail but add 1 with swm. I then get 3 destiny each one is a 2. I retrieve my 3 and he loses maul. In 2 turn I drain him out. FW by 12.<br>
<br>
Highs: a good close game<br>
Lows: mike didn&amp;#8217;t take out his entire deck and 1 of those cards was sebulba&amp;#8217;s racer. So it was a tainted victory, sorry man. <br>
<br>
So Justin won by 18 and so I won the tournament by 6 diff. I get an iao foil and a pack, which held a master qui-gon. Mike had to leave early because he won tickets to raw is war. He had a sign that on 1 side said would u please shut the hell up! And on the other side had Lita marry me! Anyway I played raw deal game against mike pistone who went 4-2 and I beat him once I pulled of a your not in my league. All day we had 3-4 people games and many 1 on 1 matches. It was a fun tournament.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>

Justin, we had a great game.<br>
Ross and Steve, we have to playtest sometime.<br>
