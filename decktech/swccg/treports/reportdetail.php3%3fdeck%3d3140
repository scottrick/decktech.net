---PLEASE NOTE--- If the !@#%^&amp; shows up it?s cause I typed this on word and it has apostrophes if it doesn?t then cool? Thanks<br>
<br>
Tournament time in Lancaster California. I wasn?t sure if I was going to make it to this tournament because the person that was supposed to go with me couldn?t make it because he had to do the Girlfriend thing. Which is understandable but unacceptable?but appreciative none the less and came to my tournament the day after? Thanks Carlos ? anyhow the tournament was set and I got another friend of mine to come with me for the trip. On the way down there we stop at this Taco Bell and I get my Chicken Fiesta Burrito (without the Tomato stuff) and a Chicken Gordita Supreme (again no Tomatoes) and Aaron gets some Nachos ? we stare at the girls that are ahead of us and I feel old? I mean they were like 18-20 and I?m older than that?. But it was a nice site to see. <br>
<br>
Anyhow were driving along almost 85 miles an hour, pass Magic Mountain (for those that don?t know that?s a Theme Park) and get to the tournament, after passing the street the first time we find it and go inside. The place itself needs to be cleaned and they need to organize their shop but none the less it?s a cool place to play and they had 2 cats roaming around the store.<br>
<br>
So we get there and like we were on the way up we weren?t sure what the challenge would be like and didn?t want people to know who we were so we were going to play with our cards outside the sleeves and penny sleeve to be ?low class? however we didn?t cause we got in a game of Lord Of The Rings instead. --- Disclaimer --- for those that don?t play this game should really check it out. It?s a lot of fun --- end --- So we get our command cards and fill them and Mike, the boyfriend of the girl that was running it asked me if I was ComicCon this year and I said that I was and he?s like, yeah I remember you I was sitting next to you when you got the Maul?s? I was like oh, okay cool nice to see you again.<br>
<br>
So we clean up our game and then Mike tells me that their short a person because some people were sick and out of it so they weren?t going to make it and then 2 more people walk in so we have 10 players (Mike played so there wouldn?t be a bye, what a guy).<br>
<br>
So my decks for this tournament are: Light Side ? QMC (coming soon) and Dark Side ? TOTAL Hunt Down ? (also coming soon)<br>
<br>
So I get to hear my name called out first, and then Mike is my opponent so I?m thinking cool I get to play someone new (the whole reason mind you for coming here to play new people) So we sit down and get ready.<br>
<br>
Light Side QMC vs. Mike Dark Side ? This Deal Is Getting Worse<br>
<br>
I start with Menace Fades, Squadron Assignments, Keeping The Empire Out Forever for both games and Mike starts Crush The Rebellion, I?m Sorry, Something Else and Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans (from his Objective) His first turn he drops his sites, gets another 2 sites and deploys them and then says go. Now I?m thinking that maybe I should be EXTREMELY careful here since this may be the toughest match-up for this deck?but I play like I always do. I first take out the Defensive Shield (the snag card) and then activate my force look at my hand and draw a couple and say go? I had Obi-Wan With Lightsaber, Qui-Gon With Lightsaber, Lando, Scoundrel and Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader, Outrider and some other cards? I drew up and got the Red Squadron 1? So I leave the rest and he activates gets some cards with his Objective and says go again? So I activate all that I can, drop Wedge in Ship and Lando at 1 site and Qui-Gon at another so that I can flip then I look through with KTEOF and then see that Dash is not there so I chance it and then look for him and there he is and drop them to Bespin with Wedge were they sit for the entire game force draining for one and helping secure the Celebration which comes out? His turn he drops Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith against Qui-Gon and Lando however the Barrier that I had stopped that beat down?then he dropped Dengar With Blaster Carbine for backup. So on my turn I KTEOF and get Clash Of Sabers?forgetting for a moment that he can cancel it with Crush but then I drop Obi-Wan With Lightsaber and Luke With Lightsaber as well now against Dengar and Vader and Clash Vader?look at him and he turns Vader to be out of the battle I almost said what about Crush but decided not and that battle pretty much won me the game. A couple of battles later and he again had Vader out with Mara Jade this time and again I played Clash Of Sabers against him (after retrieving it with Celebration) and then I play it again against Vader and he turns him so I drop Corran Horn and another person and go about beating poor Mara Jade up? and that nets me the win. After cleaning up and telling him the total I then remind him that Crush The Rebellion cancels Clash of Sabers by loosing a force? and for the remainder of the night he keeps telling me that he won?t forget that so I hold him to that and he keeps smiling and I keep telling him?don?t forget Crush cancels Clash?<br>
<br>
Full Win: 31<br>
High: Clash not getting cancelled?<br>
Lows: Him not canceling Clash with Crush.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Dark Hunt Down vs. Aaron Lightsaber Combat<br>
<br>
The bad thing about playing Aaron against this deck is that I know this deck better than he does, why you may ask?It?s my deck? Aaron didn?t have much time to make this deck and the deck that I made was designed to combat this deck and wipe it out.<br>
<br>
So Aaron starts with the normal stuff?.and I start with the same thing for the other game as well? Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans, Maul Hunting (so I can keep the Obj.) and (er?.something else) as well as Epic Duel and Visage Of The Emperor. My deck also has Dark Rage and Deep Hatred so that I can stack cards under my Jedi for Lightsaber Combat. Anyhow I start and drop Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith @ one of the Naboo sites making him flip his Objective, then I drop his stick on him and then say go? He drops Qui-Gon and initiates a battle and we both forget that he can?t good thing for him because I had a 7 under Vader and when I swung I drew a 7 and 3 to hit Qui-Gon his destiny was a 6 to get rid of Vader and that was the first battle. At this time Mike comes over and watches, he got the by. :-P and we talk while we play. The next round I drop another Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith (there are 5 in the deck) to the same site and say go. This time Aaron doesn?t do anything except pick up some. Then I drop Maul with his DoubleBladed Lightsaber and Dr. E at the other site and say go. Aaron proceeds to drop Obi-Wan (which I immediately Circle Is Now Complete) and that ruins that strategy he only has enough force to drop Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and his Lightsaber so he does in front of Maul &amp; Dr. E. My turn I activate ask if he has any actions, he doesn?t then I disarm Luke and Operate to force drain him for 4 then 2 at the other site. If I had had a Vader?s Obsession I would have used it but I didn?t so I drop Vader?s other saber on him and then reinforce the docking bay which I get from my deck with Emperor Palpatine and Janus Greejatus at this point Mike gets up and walks off to do something else a few rounds later Aaron drops Han With Blaster and Leia With Blaster against the now moved Darth Vader, DLOTS w/Stick he switched with Dr. E and Maul cause I didn?t want Dr. E going to the Used Pile if he was hit. And he battles, so I choke the life out of Han and he dies, then he shoots Vader and misses then I swing at Leia and hit and she goes to the Used Pile and that ends that. Now I know I could have not swung and beaten her out in attrition but Aaron returned 3 cards last time and activated down to them so I guessed he had a 5 or 6 to get rid of Vader so I didn?t chance it and then I just forced drained him out of the game.<br>
<br>
Full Win: 21<br>
<br>
Highs: None really<br>
Lows: Playing a person I drove 2 ½ hours with and against my own deck.<br>
<br>
At this point I am in first and I go and talk to Mike, hey Mike so what?s the new haps.. he told me that Crush cancels Clash by loosing a force ? I said Oh, really I didn?t know that. We laughed? this happens like 8 more times throughout the tournament.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Lightside vs. Edwards Endor Ops. (making the Death Star)<br>
<br>
Well Ed plays REALLY Fast which I don?t mind but he has to remember to let the other person react to something that he did? which will be explained in this little episode so read on McDuff? anyhow he starts with some stuff that doesn?t really bother me I do know that he started with Imperial Arrest Order but not Secret Plans (at least I don?t recall him using it and I never paid to retrieve) so he starts setting up the Death Star and I asked him why he didn?t deploy Moff Jerjerod and he said that he didn?t want the Jar Jar beat down? I told him that I don?t have Jar Jar in the deck, he believed me?sucker --- ~smirk~ I actually don?t but that was just too funny. So on my turn I activate and again I have Lando, Scoundrel in my hand and some other characters and what not. I noticed that he had some force saved so I didn?t do anything except draw a couple getting Ten Numb, Blue Squadron 5, Dash and something else? and he plays Twi?lek Advisor from hand before his turn and goes and gets Mobilization Points of course he didn?t show and I forgot to ask but that?s fine? So he activates drops Mobilization Points and immediately goes for the Executor ? I tell him to STOP and hang on a sec I have a reaction . He?s trying to tell me that I can?t do anything cause it?s immune to Alter and I told him that I wasn?t going to Alter it I had a Reaction to your deploy of your card and so he said ?Fine, what? and I went into my shields and pulled out Don?t Do That Again and thus cancelled his little Mobilization Points at which time the Executor (after getting it) went back into the deck to never be seen again. He then proceeds to move the Death Star 2 to Bespin and make me loose some force. He did Deploy Lord Maul and someone else to Bespin as well. So I activate drop Ten in Ship, Dash in Ship (after looking for it), Cloud City Occupation then Lando, Scoundrel and Luke With Lightsaber and we fight the site clears and I loose 2 from his Death Star Orbiting Bespin after a few rounds pass he starts to come to me again and again we battle and I keep loosing stuff and he keeps losing stuff only I get to retrieve 3 a turn and force drain for 5 a turn so in a sense I am only loosing 1 a turn to his 5 much to my favor. So several more battles later Qui-Gon With Lightsaber comes out like 10 times in the same game cause I would play A Jedi?s Resilence and then retrieve it and then activate down and get the other one with KTEOF so that was a viscious cycle for Qui-Gon W/Stick. After a few more moments of fights and retrieval he moves Moff Jerjerod over along with Dengar (from JP) and I drop Leia and Qui-Gon With Lightsaber there and battle there goes both of his and my Leia. Another round or two of me loosing 1 (cause I retrieve 3) I spread out a little and he finally drops some stuff at Rendili a Dreadnaught and a Tie so I drop my Han, Chewie &amp; The Falcon and battle wiping the site and about 5 overflow and I loose them even tho I didn?t have to. That won me the game I lost 4 from my hand and he picked up.<br>
<br>
Full Win: 21<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning I guess ? Han Chewie &amp; The Falcon finally coming into play.<br>
Lows: Ed trying to play to fast, good thing I know the rules? slow down man.<br>
<br>
So after that I get up walk around watch some people play LOTR (Lord Of The Rings) an then talk to Mike and yes we talk about how Crush cancels Clash.<br>
<br>
We get going onto game 4<br>
<br>
Dark vs. Ed?s Lightside Massassi Base Ops deck.<br>
<br>
WOW!!! I haven?t seen this in a long time. Especially not one that?s Tournament worthy but his was good?at least when I saw him play it vs. another person against me it was over too fast for him? First turn I drop Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith to one of his sites and move in. He activates draws and looses one then I go and drop Mara Jade, The Emperor?s Hand (look for his glowwand and drop that) then drop Dr. E at his site for a drain of 3. He drops some characters we fight this happens a lot? He goes space with Red Leader, His Ship and a Proton Torpedo. I drop Zuckuss In Mist Hunter and 4-Lom With Concussion Rifle there and battle he shoots and hits but gets no destiny cause of ZiMH but he wipes the site and so do I. Some more battling happens on the ground he ends up killing Darth Vader 3 times and the 4th one comes out and he?s like DAMN!!! How many are in that deck ? I told him that there were enough to handle the job, then smiled and said 5. Finally it comes down to him dropping Luke Skywalker from premiere I almost didn?t recognize him at the site between Vader and Mara so I move Vader over next turn with some stacked 7?s I Vader?s Obsession Luke, he converts and that?s game cause he only had like 4 force left.<br>
<br>
FW: 21<br>
<br>
Highs: Converting the Whiner Luke<br>
Lows: None to speak of<br>
<br>
<br>
So at the end I ask Mike and where a good place to get some food is and he?s trying to give us directions and I?m like nah nevermind we?ll find something along the way. And so we say our goodbyes and that?s that.<br>
<br>
We head home and as normal not following directions we pass the street were supposed to go down to get on the freeway turn around and go down the right one then find a Denny?s about to go and pull in and see that it?s packed then leave then move down the road some more and there?s another one so we stop there and then get some gas and munchies for the trip home? of course we get off on the wrong exit, get lost I get directions and we get back on and get home by 1:00 am?. <br>
<br>
It was fun, An Adventure and I may do it again?although I will plan a little better and maybe I will find some crash space down there so that we can leave in the morning.<br>
<br>
Ah well????<br>
