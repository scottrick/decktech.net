Lompoc Saturday 13-01<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is been over three weeks since I attend a tournament. Unfortunately, only tournament I could find was 190 mile away with 5 freeway changes. But that was cool. It was close to Santa Barbara to surf and catch some waves after wards. So call the Palmdale traveling squad at 6:00 in the morning to get going. Of course, it kind the hard to get up at 7 o clock in the morning after a long week but, it has to be done for wars. So we got the map from the yahoo (it is an only way to travel). Got the boys dressed up, and went to pick up Ed. After that left for the 190-mile trip one way trip. <br>
I was taking training deck for the light side with mess beat down. The tie deck to kill off any profit idea. (I hate profit) <br>
<br>
First game<br>
<br>
Bryan west hidden base flips Vs My tie deck<br>
<br>
This was a weird match up. We were getting ready to rumble and try to outmatch each other.  I deployed, the sinear fleet with its system and a tie. He deployed Kessel, Endor first turn and kept force. I made a comment that we were not going to force choke each other and he laughed. I activated and said go. He knew I was looking for him to deploy first and he wanted to me to deploy first. He activates and deployed sullust, Lando in falcon to rendezvous point. I activated and drew three cards. By now I had 7 tie intercepts and 2 all power to weapons with some ghkks in the hand. He activated and deployed naboo and few ships to Sullust and drew some. By now he had 7 activated force and 14 cards in the hand. I activated and deploy 4 ties to Sullust with a tie weapon and battled. He hojics the damage. I knew that was coming. Classic play of hidden base deck He activated and deployed Luke with his ship there and wedge with outrider. I barred one and shot out rider of the sky. He was disappointed but he knew this game was going to be long. I activated lateral damage wedge and deployed ig88 in 2000 and couple of ties, (which makes me retrieval at same time) and initiated battled. I hit him for 12 force. I feel better now. I am up by 20 cards and drain in two places next turn. This rocks.  He deploys Raltier system and a ship with a raltier captain to raltier and another ship to kessel with another captain he puts down kessel run. I go @#$%. I am thinking its is not good. So he completes the kessel in one turn, retrieval @#$%s loads of force. I activate and get pissed off. I lose all power weapons to grab three ties and decided to control kessel. Drain for 4 and deploy the mother load to raltier and kessel. 8 ties and 2 dreaghnuts with all power to weapons ready for combat.  I kick the @#$% out of the raltier captains but he had forfeit for any damage. Now I control three systems and he can not do a kessel run. He looks at me and nods and says, &amp;#8220;I never met any one still playing ties.&amp;#8221;  I laugh and say that,  &amp;#8220;I keep my @#$% in space as long as possible.&amp;#8221;  He laughed. I drain him out after that. Nothing really happen after that. I never deployed another tie and he never try to drain me so it was a nothing else to say.<br>
<br>
Full win:  2 + 27 <br>
Prompts: for ties been +1 front of x-wings<br>
Slops: for me. Playing the same deck last year and a half.<br>
Overall it was a good game.<br>
<br>
James zajics senator deck Vs train deck<br>
<br>
This game was over before it was started. I made the both decks and knew what he was going to do. He never really had any thing going. He drains me for one at the senate all game. Never left the senate. I retrieve with harvest all game long.<br>
<br>
Full win: 4 + 22  (49)<br>
Prompts: To me for making his deck last night. <br>
Slops: to him for not remembering his objective<br>
<br>
Sean (director) hunt down Vs light<br>
<br>
This game took forever. He knew my destinies were huge but limited on characters. My inexperience in ground battle really took a toll in the game. I started with pod racing he had the pod racing but didn&amp;#8217;t really care about doing anything about it. Most the games I ran around with Ben, Luke and qui in the pod-racing arena and moister farm. He started kill my guys off one by one. He used sorry about the mess twice to kill of my Jedi&amp;#8217;s. I was dead in the water. I retrieve most the deck and able to kill off the visage but he got the better off me in the last battle of the game. I had qui-gon jinn with a swing stick, queen and the figurine Dan (nothing wrong with little retrievals RIGHT). He deployed maul with lightsaber and Boba fett. And initiates battle. He swings at qui gon and hits the dude and plays sorry about the mess. (@#$%) He caps the queen and leaves figuring Dan there and I could see him going &amp;#8220;help me.&amp;#8221; He gets a destiny of 6 and I get 7 but I lose by 8 and that was that. It was a long game. I gave him no drains with projection of skywalker. <br>
<br>
Full lose 4  - 20 (29)<br>
<br>
Prompts to him for taking his time calculating and telling me that shim can not be trained.<br>
Slops to me for let in go the visage. He would have lost to the visage. I had mess retrieve. Damm me<br>
Overall it was good game<br>
<br>
Broaden echo base x-wing swarm Vs tie deck<br>
<br>
This game was over in 3 minutes. He deployed a x-wing to Hoth and I hit him for 27-battle damage. I drain him out for 6 force a turn. That was it. Nothing I can say accepts I am sorry.<br>
<br>
Slops to me for unloading on a x-wing<br>
Prompts to him for try to setup the echo base even after the 27 damage. At least he did not leave<br>
Overall, it was the second fastest game I ever played. <br>
<br>
Full win 6 + 41  (70)<br>
<br>
At this time the director ask if we want to play 6 games. Most of the people wanted to play 6 games and my scrub crew was fine with so, we played two more. I decided to get my head out of my @#$% and win this tournament. I need to win Sean who was 4-0 with a 104 differential. I was pissed off. Don the destroyer had last differential than some one else. No freaking way. So I decided to catch a smoke out side and scout his decks. I knew he was playing hard core profit. I very nasty but very lucrative profit deck. Very nice deck Sean. <br>
<br>
Sean profit to the core deck Vs my tie profit killer tie deck<br>
<br>
He knew my tie deck my going to be tough but never knew how tough. It runs two dark waters, three spies and bright center of the universe targeting tat.  Also sinear fleet, with 4 systems which has 2 drains. This kills any profit that I faced so far. It was all about the force drains. I drain him for 8 a turn he made me lose 4 + 1 for drains. I could never find kedar the @#$% to stop the force drains out right. There was no battle at all. I drained, he made me force lose. <br>
<br>
Full win 8 + 10  (80)<br>
<br>
Prompts to me for not going soft on profit. <br>
Slops to any one who does not have any ships in their decks. Come on Sean, you should know there has be a least one good ship in ever decks. But great ground deck.<br>
Overall I am in still in second place. Ahhhhhh I am frustrated.<br>
<br>
Last game now. All or nothing now. Balls to the walls.<br>
<br>
Eddie senate deck versus my training deck. (Sean Vs Bryan) <br>
<br>
We knew each other deck like he was my evil twin. He kept his but in the senate. He drain me at corusant and senate and drain him and battle at the docking bay once. He has no retrieves accept with the senators so it was fine. There is nothing to say about the game. I made it to test 5, and won the race and harvest. I drained him out. Out of commission Vader and maul in the beginning made the game much easier. <br>
<br>
Full win 10 + 21  (101)<br>
<br>
Prompts to me for keep him at the senate and out of commission Vader and maul.<br>
Slops to him for losing Vader and maul to pod racing. It kills him. Never lose an extra maul or Vader when someone is playing out of commission. Great card.<br>
Overall, Sean took a lost from Bryan which made my life easier. I knew he would of won the tournament overall of he won the last game. He was the destroyer for a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for prompts:<br>
1 to carrels JR for taking credit cards. 99c chicken burgers. 10 of them hits the spots<br>
2. For everyone for driving there<br>
3. For Sean for running the tournament. <br>

<br>
Slops for me leaving 4 hours early and driving 85 miles an hour to get there in 2 hours. <br>
<br>
