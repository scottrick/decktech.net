Today Clayton, the TD from Parramatta, came to hold a demo for lord of the rings and hey its not so bad a game. Maybe it would have been even better if it had multiplayer mechanics, oh well. So I&amp;#8217;m using the decks I had last week cause they are that damn good. LS QMC (a place for tech) and DS TDIGWATT (troopers who set up quick, but not actually &amp;#8216;speed deal&amp;#8217;). After r3 comes out these decks probably won&amp;#8217;t be hurt at all, but I&amp;#8217;ll still change em. I have WYS and ds senate in mind. Ok on to the TR. <br>
<br>
GAME 1: QMC vs Clarrie Brown&amp;#8217;s YMSYL<br>
Yeah this is a familiar match up. Clarrie now knew how to play this deck so he drew up a massive hand and after a matter of turns had set up a walker on 3 different marker sites, probably with tramples and barriers in hand.<br>
In my first 2 turns I set up my hand with kier santage, wedge, liea and lando and flipped on the 3rd turn. I then dived for menace fades so he couldn&amp;#8217;t WG me. Of course imperial decree prevented drain bonuses from pucumir, so we where on even ground. I de ployed celebration only to have it cancelled by mm/EO. But I grappled the mm/eo with grappling hook, and edged back celebration. Unfortunately the game took a turn that prevented me setting celebration up again till the very end. Lord Vader tried to beat up poor lando sitting on his own at the north corridor, but path saved his hide. I had to look for cadrs to get rid of Vader who started cancelling drains where I had no alien.<br>
 Harc seff keep his drains down while I set up. I was loseing about 5 a turn to his 3-4. the balance started to shift his way. Corran horn and obi tried to attack a lone walker but obi got barriered and corran got TRAMPLED!! I started to mildly panic as I couldn&amp;#8217;t stop his damage and he was overtaking me. The only thing in my favour was BP/DTF making him pay and goo nee tay+ bespin text made his mains very expensive. Finally I got a force that could take on lord vader: Epp Luke, Epp han and a path to get liea there as well. I deploy, path, battle. Han gets YAB. I miss the chop. Luke gets hit. I had tracked some 5s and 7s with Mirax but clarrie had omni boxed my deck last turn. Liea fires her gun adding 3 with SATM/blaster pro. I draw a 5. vader is hit. I draw artoo in red5. he draws zukuss. Vader and a @#$% load. <br>
I use my sole off the edge. Then set up celebration. I still take 2 more turns of 5 card damage b4 I can put him away.<br>
FW +5<br>
2 +5<br>
<br>
GAME 2: TDIGWATT vs Steve mc callum&amp;#8217;s WYS<br>
REVENGE!!!!!! This is the deck that has dealt one of the my ds deck&amp;#8217;s only 2 tournament losses.(the other was by only 1 card to a dagobah insert deck, AAA now solves that problem). I drew about 17 cards looking for a goddamn ship just so I could deploy DarkDeal, while steve set up as usual on tatooine. However unlike the first time we played this match up I didn&amp;#8217;t deploy Cloud City until I could deplot DD in one turn. Eventually I get bossk and down he comes with 6 assorted troopers to get dD working I also deploy CC occupation at this time. Immediately steve loses YISYW to pull menace fades. SHYTE!<br>
 However I had planned fro this event and had a contingency plan. The mighty BLACK SUN FLEET!! Haha the perfect counter for menace fades. Steve had dash, melas and mirax sitting on tat. System. Also wedge was in the cantina and theron nett goes off the top on a plink drain next turn.  So that is most of his ships accounted for. Steve drains for 3 in his turn and deploys Jedi luke and phylo to the db and sets up tat celebration. He draws up to 15. I pull monnok/evader. Play it used. My turn I pull it again and play it lost. Catching 2 Jedi lukes! More importantly he does not have Captain Han or the falcon or anything that can directly pull them out.<br>
 In my control phase I use BLACK SUN FLEET to move bossk in front of the tat force so he no longer satisfies menace fades! Drain for 6 and lose 2 to occupation. Big hit. I drop chimeara, ozzel, and lateral damage on outrider. Battle. I get a 3 he draws an unbelievable combo of: c/tunnel vision and captain han. I loss ozzel and he losses dash+melas. In his turn he drains and moves so celebration is cancelled but his moves to bespin o cancel my occupation. From then on out its just the same crap with him draining for 3-4 while I drain for 9-11 because bossk keeps moving back and forward between tatooine and bespin. he did cancel the drains a couple of time with control since the TD ruled that the objective prevents modification not cancelling. Eventually Luke and lando come to cloud city via db but I just battle with trooper assault and loss one trooper while he losses luke.<br>
FW +10 <br>
4+ 15<br>
<br>
GAME 3:QMC vs Luke Bartter&amp;#8217;s Hunt-down solid<br>
Ok I thought this was gonna be a real bad match up for QMC since all I had tio stop visage was 1 OOC/TT and corran horn. I set up as normal a little thinner than usual since I had hyper escape in hand so wedge could drop to the DB if need be. Palpy hit the table b4 vader but rarely drained due to BP/DTF. Goo Nee Tay came out earlier than usual (I picked it up rather than having to search for it) and it practically crippled him. I also threw down Order To Engage as it usually helps against a drop and drain attack. Lando and liea sat comfortably on their sites with paths in hand.<br>
  Visage was my main problem and OOC/TT when off the top. I pulled corran from force and sent him to the holotheatre as soon as I flipped. He cancelled visage. Then luke deploys Maul and DR.e/p baba he redeploys visage . I path to the medi chamber. He moves maul across I lose to visage(I was throwing out my sac package{2 sense,2alter} and excess ships etc as he was flipped almost the entire game) now comes the fun part. <br>
I deploy celebration and spread even thinner across CC since Vader and most of the bounty hunters were chaseing liea and harc seff between the guest quarters and the carbonite chamber reducing his drains when force allowed. I Left corran horn I front of maul deliberating so when he battled I could path infront of dr.e and cause OTE damge. This of course worked perfectly. In fact OTE cause more damage than any other single card because later on 4-lom and p-60 (jankiest card in the game) got Isolated from vader and tarkin and were forced to keep running from liea and luke who kept  following them ,a site ahead of vader and kept forcing more damage. Luke tried to pin corran between maul and dre by reinforcing dre with Thrawn . this just allowed me to deploy obi and clear the site cancelling visage again. So celebration slowly retrieved heaps and mirax tracked Jedi&amp;#8217;s Resilience for a big On The Edge retrieval. I think he drew up soon after.<br>
FW +20<br>
6 +35<br>
<br>
GAME 4 TDIGWATT vs Clarrie Brown&amp;#8217;s Profit<br>
<br>
He flipped first turn. I flipped second turn. VERY fast game. Even though you&amp;#8217;d think I&amp;#8217;d have a big advantage here, clarrie was very smart (he knew my deck well). He started with A Tragedy has Occurred so he could grab trooper assault. I soon run out of them and he swarmed CC. He spread thin as sh1t on tatooine. Lose1 drain drain1 at 4 dif Sites chews throught a deck real quick. I set up occupation late and was only draining at one site. Liea, chewie and quiggy chewed up sites at a time. I spread out and drained for 9 a couple of times after quiggy died. I drained him down to 1. I lost 3 for han luke and liea. I had 1 in hand and 1 in reserve. He drains for 2 with luke I play projective telepathy to cancel the drain. I get drained for 1 more. He can&amp;#8217;t believed he got robbed. I win.<br>
FW+1<br>
8+36<br>
<br>
GAME 5 TDIGWATT vs Luke Bartter&amp;#8217;s Boom Racer<br>
<br>
Another game that was as tight as a fish&amp;#8217;s a$$. Boom Race is fairly popular around here so I was familiar with what I should do. And that was draw a sh1t load and drain ASAP. I monnok and get 2 &amp;#8216;Too close for comforts&amp;#8221; but more importantly see he has only obi Epp. Enough to prevent a completely thin spread. I move deploy dark deal and move bossk with thrawn in the back seat to bespin to increase his deploy costs.  Luke sets up scouts and general solo in the bunker and gets some charges. I drain for 4 and draw for more troopers and assaults. Luke wins the race but misses an attempt to blow the bunker. I loss 6. he retrieves. After draining I deploy AAA though it never affects him the whole game. Move over 3 sites. <br>
Next turn Luke blows the bunker. I had order me hand so I lost 6 of the 8 from me used pile. He moves to the back door and drains for 3. I&amp;#8217;m loseing cards hand over fist. So I gotta do somthing. I activate everything so I can pick up the 2 trooper assaualts I had to put in used pile and spread over all 4 sites with 2-3 characters each. Occupation is finally deployed. I get drained for 3. luke moves to the landing site. I drain for 13 and force another 4 for occupation. Luke drains for 5 and deploys obi wan against my weakest site (thrawn, ozzel and a cadet) but fails to clear the site.<br>
Next turn drain him out. One thing to consider luke, if your reading this is that you never enforced I Did It! the entire game. Since you had BP/DTF on table to prevent me playing trooper assault, I would have been far more reluctant to spread as thin as I did as early as I did. Anyway good game man.<br>
FW +4<br>
10+ 40<br>
<br>
GAME 6<br>
QMC vs Steve Mc callum&amp;#8217;s DS senate<br>
<br>
One word: Choke. I totally controlled this game at all times. i never looked in trouble. Anyway,  steve got lott dod and yeb yeb and flipped first turn. He deployed a Db. My turn. Draw. Steve  niemodiened fro the A/C and put daolfray and p59 there. Wedge and kier with a laser sat on bespin and liea and obi flipped. The QMC non sac dummy worked perfectly here and I was able to alter BFHI, sense a squabbling delegate and a WMAOPlans early. I put liea, obi and pucumir at the carbonite chamber after maul YA was committed at the north corridor. Goo nee tay and battle plan really hurt steve. Yeb yeb was hurting him more that it was hurting me I think. Celebration was cancelled but I grappled MM/eo with the HOOK. I drained for free and steve had to pay for maul&amp;#8217;s drain of 2. I upped the damage to 5. eventually obi and luke attacked maul and got rid of him. I recycled and track Antilles manuever and keep your eyes open repeatedly for decent on the edge/off the edge retrieval. Really nothing out off the ordinary happened here and eventually steve picked up when I was retriving more than he was draining for.<br>
FW +20<br>
12 + 60<br>
<br>
<br>
the final standings looked like this<br>
1.me 12 +60<br>
2.clarrie brown 8 +71<br>
3. Ben may 8 +60 odd<br>
4.tyng 8+ 60 odd (I think)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
* to me for winning undefeated<br>
*LOTR for possibly being a decent substitute for SWCCG<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
*Having to buy $300 on average of mage knight rebellion to get a storm golem and a chaos mage.<br>
* it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem possible to get a unique Order of Vladd, Necromancer or Healing Priest in mage knight rebellion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok then thanks for reading later<br>
