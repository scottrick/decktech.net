And,<br>
like so many other Americans, Friday rolled around and I still <br>
hadn&#146;t finished them.  So I&#146;m thinking I can&#146;t go to the tourney<br>
on Saturday, but I really want to.  So I decide to stay up all night<br>
Friday and finished the dang taxes.  Well, I get pissed off after<br>
doing my federal taxes cuz it turns out I OWE money rather than get<br>
a refund!  So I&#146;m mad.  *Really* mad.  But I finish my state taxes<br>
and its all good there.  Anyways, that&#146;s probably just boring most<br>
of you, but that explains why I will be so freakin&#146; tired for the<br>
tourney.<br>
<br>
So in staying up all night I clean up my little apartment and look<br>
over my decks.  The Hunt Down deck looks good, waaay better than my<br>
Scum deck so I&#146;ll use that one.  It uses unique Saber and Onix TIEs<br>
starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Combat Response.  Mara, Emp, and, of<br>
course, Vader are the main ground weapons.  SFS is the only <br>
retrieval.  And yes, it duels.<br>
<br>
For Light I made a new HB mains but I liked my EBO deck (already on<br>
Decktech with a few changes), so I decide to stick with EBO.  When <br>
a deck is on a streak, you just don&#146;t switch decks.  Its just Rogue<br>
speeders and xwings.  It does either ANSB start, or 3 effect start.<br>
<br>
So I head out to the train station and sleep like a log on the way<br>
to Pleasanton (I live in San Francisco), and just for kicks I bring<br>
my YJ sample deck (where all the cards have 0 or 1 damage, heheh).<br>
I get there 45 minutes before the tourney starts, do some trades &amp;<br>
play like 20 games of YJ with the sample deck against various <br>
people (the games are *that* fast with the sample deck).  I don&#146;t <br>
play YJ normally, but sometimes the sample deck can be fun.<br>
<br>
Nick Stefanko is the TD, &amp; 17 people showed to play.  On to the <br>
games.  This will be 6 games.<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS v Steven Howard&#146;s Profit (only starts Squassin)<br>
<br>
I start Mara in the Chamber, back her up with Vader 1st turn.  He<br>
draws.  I drop Emp to the Chamber, move Mara w/saber to JP for the<br>
drain of 3.  He would lose to Visage all game, so it made this<br>
game quick.  I got Kashyyk out, put the Exec there with the Emp&#146;s<br>
Sword.  Now he&#146;s eating some big drains, so he drops Protector<br>
Chewie and Capt. Yutani to JP, then draws.  Mara battles, but <br>
misses Chewie (I forgot he has armor, otherwise I would&#146;ve swung<br>
at Yutani), and I draw a 1, so I lose 2 force, he loses Yutani.  <br>
Then he deploys a Medium Repeating Cannon, and draws.  I inform <br>
him he needs a power source to shoot that, something he didn&#146;t<br>
know.  So Mara battles, and I draw high killing Chewie plus a few<br>
force and the Cannon (forfeits for 1).<br>
<br>
He came at my Exec when he dropped a YT freighter w/Kin Kian <br>
aboard.  Then he put Quad Laser Cannons aboard.  He looked for <br>
Red 3 w/Squassin, but it wasn&#146;t there.  He had lost several pilots<br>
and ships to drains and Visage.  So he battles w/the lone ship,<br>
Power Pivots Exec, and shoots the Emp&#146;s Sword.  He says he misses,<br>
but I inform him Kian adds 2 to desiny, so he hits the Emp&#146;s Sword.<br>
But he doesn&#146;t get destiny, so I&#146;m power 8 to his 3, so he loses<br>
both Kian and the ship, I lose the Sword.  I drop Endor and Saber 2<br>
w/pilot to retrive my lost force, and a few drains later end the<br>
game uneventfully.  Win by 38.  2 (+38).<br>
<br>
Best: Not letting him flip and me staying flipped all game.<br>
Worst: Mara missing the swing on Chewie and drawing a 1.<br>
<br>
After that game I realize I&#146;m not tired at all.  Good, cuz being<br>
tired is something I don&#146;t need.  I just play some YJ sample deck<br>
games in between all my games (most of them finish quickly).<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS v Kyle Ishimaru&#146;s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, Opp Enforcement)<br>
<br>
Kyle and I have a friendly little rivalry going.  Apparantly he<br>
really wants a Masterful Move foil.  And last tourney he lost to<br>
me and it cost him the 1st place, he wound up in 2nd place.<br>
I do the ANSB start.  He gets Janus and Emp at Endor DB 1st turn, <br>
but I get Battle Plan out 1st turn to slow him down.  Lord Vader<br>
goes to Endor DB, Emp and Janus move to his other DB (Tat DB I <br>
think).  He also Twi&#146;leked for Search &amp; Destroy.  I get EBO going<br>
on my 2nd turn using BHBM to deploy Hoth Luke for 2 force, but he<br>
barriered him so he was stuck under the Hoth Shield.  I drop Rebel<br>
Fleet, drop 2 xwings to Rendili, then lose 3 to Your Destiny.  He <br>
deploys Zuckuss to Rendili, I barrier, so he deploys Bossk and <br>
battles.  I have Incom on table, &amp; I play Org Attack.  Bossk dies,<br>
and Zuckuss is alone.  I play Org Attack to get 3 xwings, then beat<br>
on Zuckuss for him plus 6 more.  Oh yeah, i deployed Honor as well.<br>
But I don&#146;t have enough to move Luke to Endor DB, so I lose 1 to <br>
Your Destiny.  He draws some.<br>
<br>
I just spread my xwings out at various systems to maximize drains.<br>
Since I draw up Rogue 1, I decide to move Wedge and Luke over to<br>
the North Ridge rather than pay 10 to transit to Endor DB.   But <br>
Luke has to outside the speeder or I still lose to Your Destiny,<br>
and he has No Escape out now.  So I move them, and he brings it<br>
with IG88 against Luke and Wedge, and deploys Dengar in ship and a<br>
Dreadnaught against 2 of my xwings (one of which is Lat Damaged).<br>
So I stack a card from each battle and he captures Luke with IG, I<br>
lose Wedge, and I lose both xwings.  He loses the Dreadnaught &amp; <br>
lands Dengar w/IG88 at the North Ridge.  So he has no one at <br>
systems, I have no one at sites.  So we both must pay for drains.<br>
Although i drain for more than he does, I don&#146;t have the force to <br>
pay for them all and I lose to Search and Destroy more than any<br>
other card.  Lose by 8.  2 (+30).<br>
<br>
Best: Beatdown on Zuckuss.<br>
Worst: Beatdown on Wedge, not being able to have Luke pilot Rogue 1.<br>
And Search and Destroy was a real pain.  Normally that card doesn&#146;t<br>
hurt me.<br>
<br>
So Kyle got his wish, and I realize I need to get high differential<br>
wins and make sure no one goes undefeated.<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS v Tim Green&#146;s ROps (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br>
<br>
I do the ANSB start.  He deploys Arnet to DSII DB, I Signal for my<br>
Rebel Fleet &amp; deploy Sullust.  He deploys Vader to his Forest, I <br>
deploy an xwing to Sullust and move it to Ralltiir, saving a force.<br>
He drops Fett in Slave 1, I barrier, but he also deploys an ATST <br>
pilot to his Swamp and moves Arnet to his generic DB to flip.  I<br>
get EBO out on my next turn, and proceed to beatdown Fett with 3 <br>
xwings and an Org Attack.  He draws high (his objective helps too)<br>
but he still loses Fett and 2-3 more force.  I also deployed Battle<br>
Plan.  So he pays 3 to drain, I cancel w/Rebel Fleet, so he pays 3<br>
to drain me for 1.  I like that, paying 6 for a 1 drain.  He <br>
deploys Ice Plains w/a Tempest Scout and Chirneau there.  I have yet<br>
to draw a Rogue speeder, so I&#146;m afraid of him getting Decree going.<br>
But he just draws.<br>
<br>
So I deploy Boushh to the swamp, break cover and kill the lone ATST<br>
pilot plus 2-3 more force (I battle for free, something he forgot).<br>
And he flips back.  Now I spread my xwings to his Wakeelmui, and my<br>
Hoth, Sullust, and Kiffex.  He doesn&#146;t pay to drain and kills an <br>
xwing w/IG in ship at Kiffex.  I drain for 13, he draws.  I move<br>
Hobbie and Luke to his generic DB, and move Wedge to my North Ridge<br>
to drain for 1 (I *still* have no speeders!).  He drops Igar in <br>
Tempest 1 to Boushh, I lose her and she barely covers the damage.  <br>
He also deployed Zuckuss to Ralltiir (which I barriered), so he was<br>
about to flip when I informed him that Luke and Hobbie were at his DB<br>
so he only controlled 2 sites.  He moves the Tempest Scout to my<br>
Hoth DB and Chirneau to my MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain him for<br>
all but 1 force, then he draws his last force up.  Win by 29.<br>
4 (+59).<br>
<br>
Best: Keeping him on the zero side for most of the game.<br>
Worst: IG in ship for killing my xwing, but at least it didn&#146;t<br>
satisfy Battle Plan.<br>
<br>
Game 4: DS v Chris Green&#146;s HB mains (Insurr, Squassin, Strike Plan)<br>
<br>
Chris and Kyle are both from Lodi, and Chris wants to beat me too.<br>
So the &#146;whole Lodi crew&#146; is after me.  Oh well, who cares anyway.  :)<br>
I have Endor DB in my hand, but I know he plays it as well and I <br>
want to convert his DB.  But he doesn&#146;t deploy it, so that&#146;s fine <br>
with me cuz I only play it as a BG site for Vader.  He deploys <br>
Endor (which is in my hand, but I don&#146;t convert it just yet).  I<br>
end up losing Endor to Visage.  I don&#146;t get my Vader out until <br>
my 3rd turn, and he&#146;s just been drawing.  So I&#146;ve got Piett and <br>
Merrejk at my Exec DB and Lord Vader at his CC DB.  Its the only <br>
BG site on table.<br>
<br>
He drops Lando w/Ax to Merrejk and Piett, and I smell a beatdown.<br>
To my surprise, he deploys EPP Obi!  HD is flipped of course, so<br>
Obi can&#146;t battle, so I wait until he initiates battle and then<br>
inform him he can&#146;t battle me.  *whew*, I was saved.  I drop Emp<br>
and Mara to CC DB and move Merrejk and Piett there (Obi can&#146;t <br>
drain).  He now searches for a DB (Home One &amp; Endor DB are still<br>
in there) but he activated both!  So he deploys Jedi Luke to CC DB<br>
and moves Obi and Lando to the Med Chamber.  Well, I battle of<br>
course &amp; miss both swings on Luke, then draw low destiny.  I lose<br>
Merrejk and he loses 13 force rather than lose Luke.  Wtf?  I<br>
guess he just wanted to give up, whatever.  He activates all but<br>
one force and before he gets to his control phase to drain me I<br>
duel Luke w/Vader.  I know I&#146;ve got 2 3&#146;s on top, so if he draws<br>
a 5, we tie.  A 6 wins the duel for him.  He draws a 4 and rather<br>
than cross Luke he loses 18 force and that&#146;s game.  Win by 22.<br>
6 (+81).<br>
<br>
Best: Everything, just a good game for me.<br>
Worst: Seemed like he gave up after he made the mistake of <br>
deploying Obi to battle Piett.<br>
<br>
Well, I&#146;m ahead in differential, but I need more victory points. <br>
There is only 1 undefeated player now, John Monroe.  So, like<br>
last tourney, I play John in Game 5.  I only pray I&#146;m dark side.<br>
<br>
Game 5: DS v John Monroe&#146;s WYS (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br>
<br>
We always pair up towards the end of tourneys.  I get DLOTS to<br>
Tat DB 1st turn, he plays TT cancelling Visage.  He puts Tallon<br>
Karrade to Home One DB, saves 1.  I drop Mara w/saber to Tallon,<br>
he barriers.  I deploy Emp to Cantina.  Looks good for me so far.<br>
He pulls Falcon using Capt Solo, deploys them to Tat DB, moves<br>
Tallon aboard and takes off to the system.  I drain for 5, play<br>
Piett and Dominator to Kashyyk.  He drains me for 1, moves <br>
Falcon to Dominator, draws.  I drop Saber 4 w/pilot and a SFS<br>
cannon, but I didn&#146;t feel confident I could hit a maneuver 6 ship,<br>
so I saved 3 and let him go.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I <br>
deployed Secret Plans and SSPFT 1st turn.  Yup, it was a good <br>
starting hand.  SFS and Wakeelmui were also on table, along with<br>
the Endor DB.  So I was activating 18, he was activating 9.<br>
<br>
He dropped Jedi Luke w/saber to DLOTS (he doesn&#146;t get to flip<br>
though), battles, I Weapon Lev the saber, miss the choke on Luke,<br>
and draw low.  Luke Smoke Screens for a 6.  Vader dies, and he<br>
moves the Falcon to Tatooine, with me forgetting to make him pay <br>
+2 force to do so.  Had I remembered that, I could&#146;ve beat the <br>
Falcon down next turn.  So I deploy Lord Vader w/Saber to Luke, <br>
hit him and draw low battle destiny again so I lose 2 force.<br>
WYS is *still* on the zero side and like 20 cards are already<br>
in his lost pile.  Dominator follows the Falcon to Tatooine.<br>
He runs away, and after draining for 8, I drop the Executor, Emp&#146;s<br>
Sword, Emp&#146;s Shield (retrieving 6), and move the Dominator over to<br>
back them up (I&#146;ll Take The Leader was on table so I didn&#146;t battle).<br>
<br>
He thinks for a loooong time (as only John can, j/k John *lol*),<br>
and deploys Chewie w/gun and Theron Nett to Lord Vader to finally <br>
flip WYS.  He battles, Vader hits Chewie, Chewie misses, and we <br>
are both cleared, so WYS flips back to zero side.  He also had<br>
deployed Wedge in Red Squadron 1 to back up the Falcon.  On my <br>
turn, I deploy DLOTS to Tat DB, then battle at Kashyyk, missing the<br>
shot on the Falcon but clearing all but Capt Han and the Falcon.<br>
I had deployed Onix 1 w/ Jendon aboard, so I lost Jendon &amp; sent<br>
Onix 1 to used pile.  He backs up the Falcon by deploying Melas<br>
aboard the Skate (Mirax wasn&#146;t in his reserve).  I drain (those <br>
drains at the Cantina and Home One DB have been hurtin&#146; him), <br>
then clear him in space by shooting down the Skate.  I lose Saber 4<br>
and the pilot, then move the Executor and Emp&#146;s Sword to Tatooine.<br>
He draws and my drains end the game.  Win by 30.  8 (+111).<br>
<br>
Best: Only letting WYS flip for a single phase of a turn.<br>
Worst: Drawing low in my battles vs. Jedi Luke.  Visage getting<br>
cancelled sucked too.  I didn&#146;t draw much, so i never got another<br>
one.<br>
<br>
Now no one is undefeated and I am waaaay ahead in differential.<br>
Kyle is around 8 (+60) and he&#146;s in 2nd, so if I win the next game,<br>
no matter the differential, I win.  Kyle should be my next opponent,<br>
but we already did my LS v his DS.  So I play John again.  John is at<br>
8 (+29).<br>
<br>
Game 6: LS v John Monroe&#146;s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br>
<br>
We played this matchup last weekend with me getting a timed win by 17<br>
only because of 2 less cards than John in my lost pile.  So I was<br>
worried, to say the least.  I ask him why he doesn&#146;t start SSPFT <br>
(since it was a huge card for him last weekend), but he just says<br>
he needs those other 3 effects out for sure.  Personally, I&#146;d start<br>
SSPFT over Decree if I knew I would be playing against an xwing <br>
swarm deck.  Especially since he didn&#146;t even use Decree last weekend<br>
(against me anyways).<br>
<br>
So I start ANSB, he gets Piett w/imp Command to the Exec DB, gets<br>
Executor w/Mob Pts (the REAL Executor he calls it, not the &#146;one that<br>
got blown up in the movie&#146; as he calls it).  I Signal for Yarna, he <br>
pulls Merrejk, drops him with Piett and pulls Fondor.  I deploy EBO<br>
my 2nd turn, deploy Rogue 2, move Zev in, and move Luke to War Room.<br>
He drops Executor w/Chirneau to Fondor, deploys Yavin IV.  I drop an<br>
xwing to Executor.  I deploy Sullust and Kiffex.  I move my xwing from<br>
Hoth DB to Hoth, move Luke into Rogue 2 and move Rogue 2 to North <br>
Ridge.  He drops Thrawn &amp; Chimaera to Hoth, battles, and I Hyper <br>
Escape to Coruscant.  Executor battles my lone xwing, I play Houjix.<br>
I drain for 4, deploy a bunch of xwings at all systems except Hoth &amp;<br>
Fondor, deploy Menace Fades, and draw into Rogue 1 &amp; 3.  He deploys<br>
Devastator &amp; 2 ORS, I Hyper Escape away.  This game made me realize<br>
I need to play Order To Engage in this deck.<br>
<br>
Now I deploy Rebel Fleet, and he&#146;s eating some big drains.  So he<br>
drops a Blizzard Walker to North Ridge w/Ozzel aboard.  Then he moves <br>
Devastator to Hoth and shuttles both ORS into the ATAT.  The ATAT <br>
moves to the MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain, drop Rogue 3 w/Wedge<br>
against the ATAT, drop Rogue 1 w/Hobbie to the Ridge.  He&#146;s lost SSPFT<br>
off the top to drains, so I&#146;m *very* happy about that.  I check my<br>
reserve and see 2 5&#146;s in there, so I drop 2 xwings vs. the Avenger &amp;<br>
Chirneau and play Org Attack (Incom Corp on table).  Chirneau dies.<br>
Then Wedge battles, he draws a 3, I draw 5, but I add 1 to it w/<br>
Heading for Medical Frigate and we tie on power.  He loses Ozzel.<br>
Luke gets in Rogue 1 and I move it to Echo DB to prevent Decree next<br>
turn.  He has We&#146;re in Attack Position Now on table as well.<br>
<br>
He deploys Blizzard 2 to the Ridge w/Motti and ORS aboard.  Then he<br>
moves the non-unique ATAT to Echo DB, &amp; the 2 ORS walk into the War<br>
Room, so Decree is satisfied again (he controlled Hoth system w/<br>
Thrawn in Chimaera &amp; Devastator).  I drain (he is getting rather low)<br>
and deploy Boushh to kill an ORS at the War Room.  I also battle<br>
the lone Avenger, and smash it for 17 damage.  He loses Avenger plus<br>
8 more.  Now he&#146;s down to 8-9 life force.  He moves the ORS over to<br>
the Echo Corridor, cancelling Incom Corp but doesn&#146;t satisfy<br>
Decree cuz I moved several xwings to Hoth.  So he battles, but its moot<br>
cuz my drains next turn finish him.  This game almost times out.<br>
Win by 15.  10 (+126).<br>
<br>
Best: Not having to deal w/SSPFT, that card is what made it sooo close<br>
last weekend.<br>
Worst: None really, I always drew good destiny and didn&#146;t make any<br>
mistakes.<br>
<br>
Why is it my last game always goes to time or is about to go to time?<br>
Kyle wins his game by 30, so he&#146;s around 80 or 90 differential, &amp;<br>
once again he gets 2nd place, despite beating me.  Nick&#146;s got some<br>
real good prize support (lots of R2 packs plus a few ECC packs he got<br>
and opened up to distribute the CC packs and fixed cards).  I get a <br>
Masterful Move foil, no packs.  Thanks for reading and Happy<br>
Easter everyone.<br>
<br>
Props to:<br>
Nick Stefanko for lots of good prizes and no ruling screw-ups.<br>
Andrew Meewis for the ride back to the train station.<br>
Kyle for beating me in a good game.<br>
John for always giving me some good games.<br>
John for being the only one to beat Kyle.   :)<br>
Everyone who read this, and enjoyed it.<br>
Barry Bonds for his 497 home runs, almost at 500!<br>
<br>
Slops to:<br>
Chris Green for giving up against me, just play it out man!<br>
Steve Daniel for losing by 30 to Kyle!  What&#146;s up w/that?<br>
Alex Stefanko for scrubbing out.<br>
The U.S. Government for not giving me a tax refund this year.<br>
The Oakland A&#146;s, they should have a better record than what they<br>
have now.  They better get their act together. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="allreports.php3"><img src='images/ldback.GIF' border="0"></a><A HREF="reportread.php3?deck=2081"><IMG SRC='images/ldread.GIF' border="0"></A><A HREF="reportreview.php3?deck=2081"><IMG SRC='images/ldreview.GIF' border="0"></A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
