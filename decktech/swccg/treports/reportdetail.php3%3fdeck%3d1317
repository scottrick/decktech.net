<br>
I did Copy and paste from Word So I hope every looks fine.<br>
<br>
Pre Tourney Crap:<br>
<br>
Preparing for Decipher Con, wasn&#8217;t as good as it was last year for me.  For some reason<br>
this year I didn&#8217;t have as much time to do everything I wanted to do like, try every deck<br>
Idea, and stuff like that.  Either way I was ready and I made time to practice with the local<br>
hit squad.  This report will be Day 1 at worlds, and how I did in that, and sometime in the<br>
next few days, I will post my Day 2 report.  <br>
<br>
First the trip down was uneventful, I flew down on Delta with Avery Poliak, who plays<br>
YJ, and is good at it, in fact he ended up a finalist in that, and I was meeting up with Chris<br>
Hines, Mat Berta, and Patrick Hines, oh and Ted Hansen....oh and Brad Bedlion...I think<br>
thats everyone who stayed with us.  Anyway we got there on Wednesday with a few<br>
meeting up a little later.  We rested more that day than we did this whole trip, because for<br>
some reason after Thursday, sleep was not an option.  I did some final testing of the decks<br>
I decided to go with and played.  On the dark side I played BHBM...because it just kicks<br>
@ss, and on the light side I played direct damage MWYHL, because that beats ties and<br>
Raltiir which I thought I was going to see.  Now on to the tournament.  I would like to<br>
warn you all that I did not take any notes at all.  My mind was occupied, because getting<br>
into the event took forever, and starting later than we were supposed to really screwed<br>
things up, so my motivation to take notes, and all that went down, so I guess I am trying<br>
to say, that the details to some of these games are going to suck, because I really<br>
remember nothing from some of them.  Although I know I had fun.<br>
<br>
Last Open Day 1: Top 38 make it.....<br>
<br>
Well it starts by everyone noticing how many good players were in this, I mean there was<br>
a lot.  I saw many top players. I still felt good, but everyone was little frustrated from the<br>
late start.  For me it kind of throws me off, but anyway forget that, and on to the games.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My LS vs Steve Baroni&#8217;s BHBM deck. Rating 1837<br>
<br>
I think this guys is from Albany, because he said both of his decks were made by Brian<br>
Twigg, and how he and his bother helped him out and gave him some pointers and stuff. <br>
Well it turns out that he plays very well and makes some really good decisions at time.  At<br>
one point he gets out the Responsibility of Command on Captain Han and Much Anger in<br>
Him.  That hurt alot, After I finally grabbed his Projective Telepathy, My Anger fear&#8217;s<br>
starting hitting him, and then I was tracking an It Could Be worse, and finally to top it off,<br>
Earlier in this game, I did beat up on some ships, with Super Falcon and I Know, which<br>
gave me Legendary Starfighter, this was just eating away his deck, while I am just trying<br>
to hold on.  I was only losing force from Much anger in him, because I was preventing all<br>
other force lose, and he was losing from Legendary, and his Objective, and late game<br>
Anger fear&#8217;s.  I drew my On the Edge toward the end...(YES)...and decided to fail the<br>
attempt on Han just so I can get rid of Much Anger in Him. and then that did him in. <br>
Somehow I turn his control of the game around and won.  <br>
Full Win by 3<br>
Total: 2(+3)<br>
<br>
Highlights: I guess killing my own Han to win the game.<br>
Lowlights: Getting smack around in the beginning of the game.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Dark Side vs Steve Baroni&#8217;s Hidden Base no Flip<br>
<br>
Well with 170 people here I have to play the same person again, can you believe that? I<br>
wasn&#8217;t worried because I had a feeling I knew what to expect.  As it turned out I didn&#8217;t<br>
know everything, but I was in control of the game.  I won a major battle, and he was<br>
doing things to keep it close.  He gives me Luke so I move Vader to the Emperor&#8217;s site,<br>
and start Dueling.  I easily have 3 Battlegrounds so when I win he loses 3 force, and I won<br>
alot with my destiny&#8217;s.  Some of the details are not here, but I do know I won by 17.<br>
Full Win by 17<br>
Total: 4(+20)<br>
<br>
Highlights: My dark beats any kind of Hidden Base which is cool.<br>
Lowlights: Players the same person twice in a row.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My LS vs Justin Desai&#8217;s Ralltiir Rating 1796<br>
<br>
I really remember nothing from this game, just that he had every Counter to what I could<br>
do, he cancels fury on Vader, he cancels Anger Fear&#8217;s, he did everything he needed to do<br>
to win.  I lost by 11<br>
Full Loss by 11<br>
Total: 4(+9)<br>
<br>
Highs:???I don&#8217;t remember<br>
Lows: Well I lost to Ralltiir,and this deck wasn&#8217;t supposed to lose to that...oh well.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My DS vs Jason Dennee MWYHL Rating 1856<br>
<br>
This is another game I remember very little from.  I do know his deck was very close to<br>
what I was playing, on my light side.  I play with only 2 Projective Telepathy, and I could<br>
draw any of them early which hurt a couple of times.  Then when Legendary hit the table,<br>
I knew it was going to be tough to win.  Finally Jedi Luke comes down, and that did it for<br>
me. <br>
Full Loss by 6<br>
Total: 4(+3)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well I am still positive?...<br>
Lows: I could have beat this deck I am sure of it.<br>
<br>
Well finally this is the mid way point, and Talking to some of the other Vegas people we<br>
are not all kicking major but.  I know there is still a chance, but there was little space for<br>
error.  I was feeling a down, and so was Ted, and Matt so what better way than to take a<br>
trip to the bar.  We buy are drinks and get back to the games.  Which we had plenty of<br>
time between games to do.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My LS vs Jeff Field&#8217;s Huntdown Rating 1931<br>
<br>
Well I have played Jeff Field before this only once, and I won so that...in a weird way<br>
helps when coming into a game.  He had nothing for Anger Fear so that hurts him a bit,<br>
and suicide Obi hurts him also.  He gets some good Drains going however on Endor.  I<br>
have Twass Complete Jedi Test 1 and put some POAS&#8217;s down to reduce those and things<br>
start to shift in my favor.  He had 3 battle grounds pretty early so Visage didn&#8217;t hurt him,<br>
but it did me.  He grabs my it could be worse early as well.  Soon after I set up a Drain at<br>
Kessel with Super Falcon, (not Leia) and that does him in.  He did Duel Obi and won, so<br>
that kept it close.<br>
Full Win by 13<br>
Total: 6(+16)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well I did win, and it was always fun to play Jeff<br>
Lows: Obi lost a duel :(<br>
<br>
Now I start thinking that stopping for a drink was a good Idea, and so did my friends since<br>
they all won one too.  I was a little worried about my Dif, and if it was enough to make it. <br>
well....<br>
<br>
Game 6: My DS vs Daniel Spaid&#8217;s Deck? Rating 1724<br>
<br>
I don&#8217;t remember much, just that I controlled the game.  He gave me Luke very early, so<br>
from the beginning I had to lose a force every turn, which doesn&#8217;t&#8217; matter really in this<br>
deck.  I do my stuff and win.<br>
Full Win by 18<br>
Total: 8(+34)<br>
<br>
Highs: Hey I made it...WAIT we still have 2 more games<br>
Lows: We still have 2 more, and it about 11:30 Now...oh well.<br>
<br>
You know the funny thing is I remember last year in the Wild Card event after 6 games I<br>
was in 2nd place, with Brian Twigg in 1st.  If it was only 6 games both of us would have<br>
been in it.  Now its that all over again, so that kind of freaks me out I am worried, but this<br>
time it will be different.<br>
<br>
Game 7: My LS vs Chris Twigg BHBM deck. Rating 2190<br>
<br>
Well I have already played this deck when I played Steve Baroni, so I knew what to<br>
expect.  He did much better, and I never got out Legendary Starfighter, he had control of<br>
the game, and I just remembered we didn&#8217;t stop for Juri Juice before this game.<br>
Full Loss by 15<br>
Total:8(+19)<br>
<br>
Highs: Ahhh..  there was something ask me later.<br>
Lows: I forgot to make him lose force from Anger Fear twice...what is up with that?  He<br>
had plenty of cards in hand anyway.<br>
<br>
Must have drink that is why...so we get it and move on.<br>
<br>
Game 8: My DS vs Michael...??? forgot oopps. He was playing EBO<br>
<br>
Well I knew this deck beats EBO, but even more so if this is Baragins. and it was.  I<br>
started Secret Plans, and made a mistake this game.  I didn&#8217;t start Insig Rebellion, which I<br>
was supposed to.  You know it was 2:00 AM after all, and my opponent was nice enough<br>
to say go get it, because it was supposed to be there anyway.  If he wanted to he could<br>
have placed my objective OOP, but I had a sorry draw with the Emperor in my hand so It<br>
would have helped me better with it OOP anyway.  I wasn&#8217;t worry since I knew what he<br>
was playing.  When he puts Luke in Space I was happy, he loses 3 force hehehe.  His big<br>
Drains, hurt a little, but his retrieval is stopped with the Coward card.<br>
Full Win by 16<br>
Total: 10(+35)<br>
<br>
Highs: Yes I win...now I made it.<br>
Lows: I did make some mistakes I shouldn&#8217;t have.<br>
<br>
So the top 38 make it, and we started with 170, and I ended up in 34 place.  Thats good I<br>
did it, and I am happy.  Time for bed.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
The bar <br>
My opponents<br>
Tattooine for kicking butt<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
The DQ&#8217;s<br>
Such a late start...dam that sucked.<br>
Having such low dif<br>
<br>
Well overall I still had a really good time, even if it did take 16 hours to play 8 games.  My<br>
Day 2 report will be tomorrow.<br>
<br>
