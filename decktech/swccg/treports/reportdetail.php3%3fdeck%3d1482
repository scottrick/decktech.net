long report. Settle down. Grab a beverage. All you<br>

<br>
Intro? I heard that the St. Cloud tournament was drawing<br>
Jon Swenson and Zach Stenerson from Moorhead and<br>
Fargo, and I knew that Graham Neal and Mike Raveling<br>
were going to attend from the Minneapolis / St. Paul area.<br>
So the tournament was going to be top notch, drawing<br>
several of the top 10 players in our region. I made plans<br>
Tuesday, during the local 4-game tournament, with Mike<br>
and Graham to hitch a ride out to St. Cloud and checked<br>
back on Friday evening to confirm the plans. Once they<br>
were solidified, I decided I’d best change my decks since:<br>
a) my light side was a pile of interrupts in the shape of a<br>
very bad EBO deck and b) my light side was a pile of<br>
interrupts in the shape of a very bad EBO deck.<br>
Meanwhile, everyone and his grandma was playing Scum,<br>
so I decided I’d tear apart my Dark Side deck, too, which<br>
was a Nikto brand of My Kind of Scum (don’t mock the<br>
Niktos, 4 power and 8 forfeit for 1 force as a react<br>
anywhere at Jabba’s Palace is pretty good). <br>
<br>
Fiddling around with Light Side cards and looking through<br>
my collection, I decided that I really wanted to build a<br>
deck using Off the Edge. But that didn’t look too good, so<br>
I built a Jedi Training to Test 6 deck. It stunk. I tore it<br>
apart and built a Test to 3 w/docking bays and Off the<br>
Edges deck. It stunk worse. I tore it apart and built a<br>
TIGIH deck w/docking bays and Off the Edges. It smelled<br>
slightly better, but still not pleasant. So, I decided I<br>
wasn’t good at building new decks, and slapped together<br>
a Tosche Station deck, uncertain of my card mix. But it<br>
was late and I was exhausted from my week of work and I<br>
didn’t really care about my Dark Side deck much yet<br>
because I could build it in the car while we drove to St.<br>
Cloud and I decided that sleep was good so I went to bed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enter the morning. The snooze alarm was my friend for a<br>
few taps, and I didn’t have time to work on my decks<br>
before I left to meet Graham and Mike at Graham’s<br>
house. So I grabbed my collection of cards and drove off.<br>
At Graham’s, it is made known to Mike and I that Herb<br>
Macy will be joining us for the drive to St. Cloud (that’s a<br>
different story). And Mike reveals that he can’t drive his<br>
new BMW because it still has its racing slicks, not winter<br>
tires, and the roads are snow-covered and icy. So, we’ll<br>
take my car, but, fortunately, Mike volunteers to drive so I<br>
can work on my decks. <br>
<br>
I decide to call my light side good enough and work on a<br>
dark deck. I look at a couple of the purple cards and just<br>
get this empty feeling all throughout me. Yes, I tell<br>
myself, these cards are so overplayed that they have lost<br>
all meaning. What have I left, then? I ask myself. Well,<br>
self, my self replies, how about a Jabba’s Palace<br>
Manipulator? A light goes *DING* And I start fishing out<br>
the cards that I’ll need. I grab my Tatooine, Combat<br>
Readiness and Jabba’s Palace. That’s a start. Then I<br>
start fishing out all my 2/0 locations, Scanning Crews,<br>
Senses, Alters, Myoom Onith, Ability x3, Search and<br>
Destroy, Gailid, Monnoks--anything at all that I might use.<br>
Of course, it’s way more than 60 cards, so I start sleeving<br>
cards, whittling away at the pile. Remember, now, that<br>
this is being done in half of the backseat of my car. I am,<br>
meanwhile, entertaining the other occupants with Lords of<br>
Acid and Ramstein. So I get to the point, shortly before<br>
we arrive at the campus where the tournament will be,<br>
where I have 60 dark side cards in a deck, and I’m happy.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, my decks are: <br>
Light Side--Tosche Station and Mains <br>
Dark Side--Jabba’s Palace Manipulator <br>
<br>
It turns out Swenson and Stenerson managed to corral a<br>
few other Moorhead players. So, with the 4 of us from<br>
Minneapolis, a few daring folk from Iowa, the Moorhead<br>
crew, and the locals, the tournament is populated by a<br>
very respectable 32 individuals. Dion Erbes, the TD, has a<br>
cold and can barely speak, but everyone quiets down<br>
enough that we can hear the pairings as they are called. <br>
<br>
(I apologize for names, here. I failed to take any notes. If<br>
you played me, you know who you are. If you didn’t play<br>
me, you’re just reading about the guys, 1-6, who did.) <br>
<br>
Game 1: My Dark vs. Steve’s EBO X-wing Swarm <br>
<br>
As soon as I start shuffling, I realize that I didn’t fit either<br>
Battle Order or Imperial Decree into my deck, cards that<br>
both would normally be included. Oh well, I figure that I<br>
have two options against EBO. Either, I’ll keep all his<br>
pilots in his used pile with Screws while my early drains<br>
and Search and Destroy will bleed his deck. OR, I’ll<br>
Monnok him for all of his X-Wings. So, we start out, and a<br>
first turn Screw reveals 3 or so X-Wings and one rebel<br>
who goes back to the used pile. Gailid goes to the<br>
Audience Chamber where he’ll sit the whole game. He<br>
gets his sites and draws. I Screw him again next turn and<br>
set up another drain, so I’m getting a good early lead. But<br>
his next turn he draws up way beyond Myoom range.<br>
Something like 17 cards. No problem. I’ve activated about<br>
14 myself. I search for something and don’t find a<br>
Monnok, so I just draw, looking for the first Monnok I can<br>
find. And I draw. And I draw. And I draw. And then my<br>
force pile is gone, and I still have no Monnok in my hand.<br>
My dark side manipulator deck can’t manipulate. It’s a<br>
pile. So Steve drops about 6 systems and as many<br>
X-wings and says go. I drain for another 6 or so and hit<br>
him with Search and Destroy. But there’s nothing I can do<br>
about his drains, so he hits me for 18 or 22. And all I can<br>
do the next turn is deploy Zuckuss and some dude in<br>
space to block the drain at Kessel. That buys me maybe<br>
one turn. But it’s simply his huge drains versus my<br>
modest drains and Search and Destroy. The game ends<br>
in about 15 minutes. A full loss for me by 6. <br>
<br>
0(-6) <br>
<br>
So, after the game, I go hang out with Graham, Mike,<br>
Jon, Zach and some of the other guys. Seems each of<br>
them has won (until much later Shane comes back to<br>
report a loss--to Herb Macy, but that’s another story). At<br>
any rate, I realize now that I have a manipulator deck<br>
without Monnoks, so I say, quite honestly, that I expect<br>
to go 0-3 with my dark and hope that my light can go 3-0.<br>
Everyone else finishes their games, and we re-pair. <br>
<br>
Game 2: My Light vs Brett’s (?) BHBM <br>
<br>
This game was fairly embarassing. My opponent barely<br>
knew his own cards. He started the game by announcing<br>
each card he put into play and reading the full text. I<br>
asked him if he was doing that for his benefit or for mine,<br>
and when he said it was for mine, I asked him to stop. So<br>
he did. But the game had that same sort of naive feel<br>
throughout. With Mobilization Points out, he set the<br>
Emperor up first turn at the Throne Room, losing 2<br>
activation. He deployed The Emperor’s Power but failed to<br>
use it in two or three battles. Meanwhile, I deployed<br>
Masta Luke first turn to Tosche Station from my reserve<br>
deck (and he asked &quot;How?&quot;--so I said, &quot;Using your<br>
card.&quot;). And I activated a helluvalot on my second turn.<br>
But Vader was quick to follow. We battled quite a bit and<br>
danced around when the battling was looking bad for me.<br>
I don’t remember quite how I won, but a good deal of it<br>
came from him losing cards from his reserve instead of<br>
using Vader’s forfeit value. I felt relieved when the game<br>
was over. Full win by 27. <br>
<br>
2(+21) <br>
<br>
At this point, I know I’m going to be among the top<br>
players with a loss. And I hope to play my dark deck first,<br>
so that my light side will have an easier game again.<br>
Mike, Jon and I find an AD&D video game that was kind of<br>
fun for a while, well worth a quarter at any rate, and then<br>
we head back for Game 3. <br>
<br>
Game 3: My Dark Side Misbegotten Jumble vs. Parker’s<br>
EBO <br>
<br>
Well, he shows early signs of X-wing Swarm, so I set up<br>
Gailid and Myoom again at two Jabba’s sites. And my<br>
early damage holds him back for quite a bit. Parker pulls<br>
an interesting move and Revos the War Room, but for<br>
some reason I had put Come Here You Big Coward in my<br>
deck and, having drawn it, slap that down the succeeding<br>
turn. So, it turns into extra generation for me and a<br>
generation loss for him. Quite an important turn, too,<br>
since my Screws hold him back a bit. He gets out Echo<br>
Garrison... or whatever the effect is that lets him pull<br>
Commander Luke, etc. But that only gets him one<br>
character a turn while I’m draining for 4 and working him<br>
over with Search and Destroy. At one point, he begins his<br>
turn searching for both his Echo sites and Commander<br>
Luke. But I had a force saved and Screwed his Luke. That<br>
was the highpoint of the game for me. Sad, but true.<br>
Before he gets his EBO set up, he throws some ships<br>
into space to start draining me. But Zuckuss and Boba<br>
Fett launch into his ships at one system, and that gives<br>
me another drain of 1 per turn. However, the next turn, I<br>
Myoom and find that both Leia w/Gun and Tawss Khaa<br>
are in his hand while I have Myoom and Gailid alone at<br>
their sites on Tatooine. I’m forced to land Zuckus with<br>
Myoom and move Fett over to Gailid, but that seems to<br>
hold Parker off. He keeps losing force to my drains and<br>
Search and Destroy until very late in the game. And by<br>
that time, Vader and Mara come down to Hoth to clean<br>
up. Full win by 27. <br>
<br>
4(+48) <br>
<br>
Well, I’m pleased as punch, having won with my dark<br>
side. So I figure I may even go 4-2. And I trust my light<br>
side to do its job.<br>
<br>
Game 4: Tosche madness vs. Andrew Mahjowald (sp?)<br>
RalOps<br>
<br>
I played Andrew before in another tournament at St. Cloud,<br>
and I know he&#146;s no pushover. I should beat him, but he<br>
knows how to play his deck. When I look at my hand, though,<br>
it seems to matter very little what he&#146;ll do. I draw a 2/0<br>
site, Ben Kenobi and Luke w/Saber. First turn, he activates<br>
deploys a site from reserve and draws. My turn, I deploy<br>
Ben at the hut, my 2/0 site and move Ben to Tosche. He goes,<br>
deploys another site from reserve and an Imperial Guard at<br>
the Swamp. I activate 14 or 15, deploy Battle Plan, Frozen<br>
Assets over his saved force, Luke w/Saber against the guard<br>
and battle. He loses the guard and 5 or 6. So he activates<br>
about 6 force on his turn and draws. I activate and draw,<br>
too. His next turn, he deploys the Emperor at the spaceport<br>
site that gives +1 power and forfeit to Imperial leaders.<br>
Okay... Since he didn&#146;t start IAO. I deploy Frozen Assets to<br>
shut off his force pile. Then, to Ben&#146;s hut, I deploy Han<br>
w/Gun, Leia w/Gun and Chewbacca. I Nabrun the 4 of them to<br>
the Emperor&#146;s site and beat the tar out of the old man. At<br>
this point, the game is effectively over no matter what <br>
Andrew chooses to do, so rather than forfeit Pasty and lose<br>
only 15, he keeps the embodiment of evil on the table and<br>
loses a good 24. I look at the cards in my hand and those on<br>
the table and decide I don&#146;t need to draw another card for<br>
the rest of the game. I just stop him from draining me at<br>
all and block his drains with my armada. General Calrissian<br>
in the Falcon deployed at his <> DB. And I took 2 force<br>
loss from a battle involving the Emperor, Vader a bunch of<br>
Imperial Guards, Trooper Assault and a Dark Jedi Presence.<br>
But I never drew another card and paid for my drains to win<br>
by 40. And now I think I can win this tournament if all the<br>
undefeateds knock each other off--and I pull off a miracle<br>
win with my dark side slop.<br>
<br>
6(+88)<br>
<br>
Well, not only do I know that I can potentially win this<br>
tournament, but so does Jon Swenson who starts *accusing* me<br>
of throwing the first game of each tournament. I mean,<br>
really, can I help it if I suck at first games? Righteously<br>
offended, I tell Jon that of coure I&#146;m not trying to throw<br>
my games, but he should go ahead and try to backdoor a<br>
tournament sometime... BUT the real trick is to lose the<br>
first TWO games. No one would EVER expect that!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I believe this is the intermission wherein the<br>
inaugural Kohman Olympics took place. Josh Kohman was making<br>
a loud noise of himself and Mike Raveling suggested that he<br>
and Stenerson see who can throw Kohman further. So Mike<br>
lifts Kohman and tosses him about 3 feet. Zach, not to be<br>
outdone, tries a new technique and hurls Kohman headlong<br>
into a chair. Maybe 4 feet, but Kohman disqualifies him for<br>
brutality, still reeling from the new lump on his forehead.<br>
Later events are much gentler, including the push-Kohman-on-<br>
a-cafeteria-tray contest...<br>
<br>
Well, the new pairings are favorable to me again. I play my<br>
dark ahead of my light.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My heap vs. Justin Fleenor&#146;s TIGIH<br>
<br>
It had occured to me that I could play my dark deck like a<br>
beat-down deck and just use Screws far more than I really<br>
should. But Justin starts Do or Do Not AND Insight. And they<br>
never leave the table. This means effectively half of my<br>
deck is good for nothing other than destiny and easy choices<br>
when it comes to losing force. But I draw a Lord Vader<br>
early and deploy him to the Landing Platform. As soon as I<br>
can (while I&#146;m still force-choking Justin), I move Vader<br>
to Chirpa&#146;s Hut and set up a drain of 2. Unfortunately, I<br>
can&#146;t draw a character to save my life over the next 2 or 3<br>
turns. Meanwhile, Justin&#146;s deploying 2/0 locations all over<br>
the place and amassing a good handsize, and I can&#146;t take a <br>
peek with Screw. So I&#146;m getting a bit worried when finally <br>
he launches the initial assault. 2 Eloms, Chewbacca and<br>
Admiral Ackbar. Ackbar? What the? Anyhow, that&#146;s who comes<br>
to battle. Fortunately, I draw a high destiny, so Vader<br>
covers all but 3 and the one to IFTC. I start setting up on<br>
Tatooine with Mara and Saber, Mosep, Myoom, Dr. E and maybe<br>
some other scrub. We exchange drains until I draw a Vader.<br>
At this point, I have enough force to a) deploy Vader, b)<br>
Elis Helrot and battle or c) do both if I draw a 0 for<br>
Helrot. I search for a Jabba&#146;s location and find in my 5<br>
force: two 0&#146;s, one 1, and two 3&#146;s. Why not? I play Elis<br>
on Mara and crew before deploying. 3. Bummer. So they head<br>
over and just sit around. Choke Lord and Saber remain in<br>
my hand. Justin brings Ackbar back from the Bacta Tank and<br>
battles. I lose everyone but Mara. Stack another card on<br>
IFTC. I&#146;ve already seen the ASP droids, so I very much fear<br>
stacking another card on IFTC, lest he get the Catapult<br>
down and convert Vader. At this point my drains are keeping<br>
me in the lead. But Mara&#146;s stuck against his big, bad crew,<br>
holding Luke captive for 2 loss a turn unless Vader joins<br>
her. And when has Vader ever shrunk from a battle? Vader<br>
comes to the Landing Platform, saber in hand, and we battle.<br>
I choke Chewbacca, hit two characters and win the battle by<br>
1 power. Meanwhile, I&#146;m immune, so both my characters stick<br>
around while his are decimated. Next turn, all he can do is<br>
run away. It&#146;s pretty much a drain race from this point on,<br>
except that I had managed to use Myoom once before she died<br>
and saw an On the Edge or two in his hand. So I keep hold<br>
of a couple of my Senses just to kill that card. Finally,<br>
he&#146;s down to 10 life force or less and plays his On the<br>
Edge. Sense. I succeed and lose the Sense + 2 more. But it<br>
was the finishing blow, and I win by 21. The dark pile<br>
*somehow* goes 2-1.<br>
<br>
8(+109)<br>
<br>
And so it turns out, history *does* repeat itself. Jon<br>
Swenson lost to Graham&#146;s Scum. Graham lost to somebody. Mike<br>
Raveling lost to somebody. Stenerson lost to Josh Kohman.<br>
All of the undefeated players have knocked each other out of<br>
contention except for Josh Kohman, who has a timed win and<br>
needs to win the game to win the tournament. Meanwhile, I<br>
have (apart from Kohman) the largest differential by far, so<br>
the winner of our game is going to be the winner of the<br>
tournament.<br>
<br>
Game 6: Battle of the Joshes, Grace vs. Kohman<br>
<br>
My Tosche &quot;Can I please play against Scum?&quot; vs. Kohman&#146;s<br>
Scummy Court.<br>
<br>
He starts Court. I start Obi&#146;s Hut, Careful Planning and<br>
decide to convert his Audience Chamber. Of course, this is<br>
much better than a Profit conversion because he doesn&#146;t get<br>
to pull a CC Engineer with Chall. Not right away, anyhow.<br>
He activates, loses one and draws. I activate deploy Ben<br>
to the Hut, KFC to the Chamber and move Ben over. The rest<br>
of the game is a prolonged battle over the audience chamber<br>
with both First Strike and Draw Their Fire hitting the<br>
table. Many men fought bravely in the hot Tatooine suns, and<br>
many men died. Ben was disarmed and fatally wounded, only to<br>
recover on a later turn. Master Luke was captured, only to<br>
be freed and wreak havoc on unsuspecting aliens. But among<br>
the many battles, the most memorable in my mind was a fairly<br>
humours battle between Fett w/Blaster and Dr. E against my<br>
Luke, Ben and Chewbacca. Kohman initiated this battle and<br>
paid to retrieve (Aim High, people--I&#146;ve been reading your<br>
reports, and you let people retrieve for free... that&#146;s like<br>
*giving* them force...). He had earlier searched for<br>
something to find a 3 and a 6 in his deck. Well, he plays<br>
Hidden Weapons to target Luke, and the fateful destiny is...<br>
3. Yes, Luke is captured (where was Kashyyk? Eh, Stenerson?)<br>
and Ben gets hit by the 6 and is E-bait. Operated and dead.<br>
Nonetheless, Chewbacca stands his ground with no destiny,<br>
and since Kohman had exhausted his reserve deck, he gets no<br>
destiny either. And Chewbacca outpowers the silly evil<br>
aliens, so Kohman goes back into the force he retrieved and<br>
loses one. As the suns were setting on Tatooine and<br>
protracted battles, his Projected Telepathy gets grabbed,<br>
General Cal and Nien Numb join the fray, Scum gets<br>
cancelled, and finally the balance of powers tips<br>
irrevocably in the favor of the light side. Win by 16.<br>
<br>
So, yes, Jon&#146;s right. I&#146;m a sneaky son of a gun, <br>
&quot;backdooring&quot; yet another tournament, coming from an early<br>
loss to claim first with a total of 10(+125).<br>
<br>
Zach Stenerson got second. Swenson took third. And I failed<br>
to keep track beyond that point.<br>
<br>
So, cheers and jeers abound:<br>
<br>
Cheers:<br>
Ben Kenobi. Do I need to say why?<br>
Dion Erbes for running a smooth tournament, even while sick.<br>
Players from Moorhead and Iowa for taking the drive.<br>
The 31 players other than myself that made this a well-<br>
attended tournament.<br>
<br>
Jeers:<br>
Monnok, oh Monnok, wherefore art thou, Monnok?<br>
This is where all those &quot;...but that&#146;s a different story&quot;<br>
references come to bear...<br>
