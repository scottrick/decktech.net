<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>DPC Houston - Hype, Small Errata and Free Motels! posted by DeckTech on Tue Jul 2 2002 <br><a href="mailto:alandenny@decktech.net">Alan Denny</a>, frontman for DPC Houston, is all set and ready for action in the Lone Star State for July 12-14!  Read on for some info on a location error, free rooms, and lots of pre event hype.<br>
<br>
After holding a HUGE Star Wars Regional of 50+ people, Alan is ready for the Star Wars event at this DPC to be the biggest of the year.  Known as the <b>Matt Lush Invitational</b>, this event will be one not to miss.  DT general himself <b>Matt "Old Skooler" Lush</b> has $50 on himself EVERY GAME.  You beat Matt, he throws you $50!  It is insane!  Rumors of long time number one SWCCG player Brian Hunter's attendance has only fueled the hysteria surrounding this event.<br>
<br>
Throw in <b>Lord of the Rings</b>, the rising star <b>Magi Nation Duel</b> (with special prizes courtesy of <b>Interactive Imagination</b>), the first ever <b>professional Star Wars TCG event</b> and the number one TCG of all time <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> for $1000 prize, and this DPC is one for the record books.  <br>
<br>
Big thanks to Alan and of course the number one game store in Texas <a href="http://www.strikezoneonline" target="x">Strike Zone</a>.  Check out their website sometime, they have a really great selection of singles for Lotr and Magic, and they even BUY stuff!<br>
<br>
Now for the unusual promotional news...<br>
<br>
Alan has even gone so far to offer some <b>Free Motel Rooms</b>.  In an unheard of promotion, Alan will be cramming many unkempt, wandering gamers into a few motel rooms he's rented.  And he's asking nothing! (Although Alan is asking nothing, I personally ask whoever stays at the Motel 6 give Alan a few bucks)<br>
<br>
<b>Motel Info</b><br>
Motel 6<br>
16884 Northwest Freeway<br>
Houston, TX 77040<br>
PHONE: (713) 937-7056<br>
on Northwest Freeway and Jones Road<br>
<br>
Next, a small Errata on DPC Houston.  Your brilliant Web Designer Neal Razi copied Strike Zones other address (two stores)!  Here is the correct one<br>
<br>
17402 NW Freeway<br>
Houston, Texas 77040<br>
713-937-3141<br>
<br>
Finally Alan wants to remind you all that the best airport to fly into is <b>IAH (Bush Intercontinental)</b><br>
<br>
That was a long update, but hopefully worth the read.  Prepare to beat each others brains out, make some cash, and meet some new friends in Houston on July 12-14<br>

If I can get in on a ride, I'll head that way. drop me a d-mail and let me know!!! thanks.<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>Sorry Charles, the Atlanta DPC, Houston Open, and Dantooine Regional were warm-up events. I'm back on top of my game now...come on over to Houston and stomp me down again. ;)<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>Oh yeah, and the Vegas DPC was a cluster#&!% for me as well...but I'm good now. I think. Just as long as I take my medication...<hr>Matt Berta said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>A FUN cluster#&!% for you, I hope!<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>C'mon now, Matt, I was only referring to the actual card playing itself...everything else was off the freaking hook! VEGAS, BABY!! (I *will* make it out there again...)<hr>Michael Richards said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>I RAN that Regional of 50+ people! Yes, he did help but I was the main engine to that. Team Waco will reign number 1!<hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>Well everyone let me throw out a few shouts right now.  First to Neal for helping to make this DPC Houston HUGE!!  Hey everyone encourage the man himself to come down for it.  I also want to throw Props to everyone coming in to make this a DPC to remember ... <br>
<br>
Props to Mike Richards, as he actually ran the Dantooine Regional, Mike Patterson and myself just helped judge ... nice when the monkey isn't on my back for once.  Slops to Ryan's Steakhouse .... that was a joke, 60 gamers in a place that holds 25 ... Not Mike's fault.<br>
<br>
Well everyone I do have a few roomst that I am handling personally.  If all the out of towners pitch in $5.00 we can get more and more ... I got the hook up.  <br>
<br>
I guess we are going to have to do teams during the SWCCG DPC cause you know H-Town has to represent.  I will come up with some cool prizes for the team winners as well ... more than just a round of applause Jacob.  Oh, guess I forgot to mention that since Old Skooler and hunter will be spending the night in Houston that will have to be part of Team H-Town .... =0)  If yall have any questions let me know, See you all in 11 days.<br>

Houston, Baby<hr>Michael Girard said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>Neal...when we gonna see the magic side of decktech???<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>That week.  Check the calendar.  Mike i want to get in contact wiht you too, by phone.  I'm gonna write you.<hr>Enrique Huerta said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>Neal, any news about LOTR tie-breaks? Or will the same tie-breaks for the Vegas DPC be in use?<br>

Shadow 16<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>It's gonna be basically what we all discussed Enrique.  I just want to run through it one more time.  I've got like a million things to do (working on wrapping up another web site too), and that just keeps getting pushed back.  It'll be ready though.<br>
<br>
Finals for Lord of the Rings will definitely 2 out of 3, and the tie breakers will be slightly modified to change head to head somewhat.  Also, a final playoff will definitely be the end tie breaker.<hr>Enrique Huerta said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>I figured it was close to what I last heard, but I was wondering just how head-to-head would be handled.<br>
<br>
Good luck on the website and the DPC. (=<br>

Sorry, can't make it to Houston...but I will try my hardest for Worlds.
