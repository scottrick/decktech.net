- Neal<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Thu Jun 20 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Cool, ain't it?  Suann is really a great person, thanks a million Suann.  Let no one ever say again that cute girls don't play games.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Congrats on being the first DT Calendar Girl Suann, ya look very nice. Hopefully the excellent quality of this calendar and the good taste it was done in will cease the foolish people who claim it to be sexist or anything of the like. I really like the idea of putting DT members bdays on there, excellent way to help promote the community which is such a huge part of why many people come to Decktech. <br>
<br>
Thanks Neal, for another great addition to the site, can't wait to see the future calendars.<hr>Scott Lingrell said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>make me a dt calendar peep!<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>This is great! Useful imformation presented in a unique and beautiful way. <hr>John Lolli said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Just thought we could use a little sexism. Sorry Suann, but you are really cute, it needed to be said.<hr>Casey Barson said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Nice job with the photos.  Would have liked to have had one with her glasses on too, but beggers can't be choosers eh?  Keep em coming, I can't wait for the next one!<hr>Nick Camarata said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Yeah this is very good idea idea. She is pretty cute. You should keep doing stuf like on a monthly basis.<hr>Ryan French said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>awesome calendar, done in very good taste.  i may be a little miffed that my regional convention didn't make the grade, but its not a national event like the DPC.  <hr>Eric George said on Thu Jun 20 2002 <br>Whoa susana!<hr>Alex Tennet said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>I totally echo Andrew's comments. The job Neal has done on laying everything out is really first class and he's had a great member to include. Thanks for joining in, Suann. This calendar really is "For the players, by the players."<hr>Chris Cicconi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Yes very nice, well and tastefully done.<br>
I can't believe you forgot CANADA DAY!!!!<hr>Robert dayton said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>your cute suann, but you need to show off some curves in the pics.<br>
also, how old are you? dont take this the wrong way but you look like 14 or something. and if you are 14, contact me, im 22 and horny  :)<br>
<br>
<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>good job neal.<br>
<br>
my only gripe would be with the layout (dont take it as a slight to your effort by any means), could use a bit of fotoshop work/decktech logo somewhere/transparencies & layers/maybe a bit of 3dsmax...you know, some graphic eye candy to complement the whole thing...if anyone's been to celldweller.com and seen some of the guy's promo fotos/desktops ud know what i mean...nothing too hard, just press a couple of buttons and throw some effects in.<br>
<br>
but thats just me. keep it up.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Tiuli Anfossi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Nice lay out and pic.  <br>
Job done really well.  Even have it has my backgroud :).  <br>
<br>
Everyone COME TO ORIGINS and the only flaw is NO CANADA DAY   :(.  <hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>pat, if you werent in the states or whatever, id stab you. repeatedly. with a big knife.<br>
<br>
she's not an 'arab' you twit, she's eurasian. eurasians are the most attractive people in the world. i should know, im half asian myself.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>The person from the above deleted post has just earned himself the most severe ass kicking I and anyone else I can find in range can give.<br>
<br>
That's no joke. I will beat your ass, me, old skooler, and anyone else around.  You scum bag.  If you really are pat ziagos, you are gonna be pounded<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Tiuli - I was gonna put Canada Day!  But no one reported in with it.  I definitely would have.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Add me to that list, those comments were both crude and uncalled for.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>I think I know Pat well enough to say that it's really really unlikely that he would post anything offensive here...  Now certain other Clark Summit area players on the other hand...<hr>Marc Urrutia said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Anytime someone takes a risk, and does something bold (Like Suann), there will always be those who will become jealous and attempt to lambaste the risk takers.  While these comments are vulgar, and uncalled for, they are also empty and powerless.  What someone is actually saying when making such an attack is, “I’m jealous and cowardly, please validate me by becoming upset”.  <br>
<br>
Suann, that may not be the last negative comment you see but please do let such foolishness affect you.  I applaud your courage, and based on 99.9% of all the comments, I see have earned much praise and well deserved at that!<br>
<hr>Tiuli Anfossi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Pay no attention to people’s stupid comment as there will always be people who don’t like all races and that compare a real women to those Photoshop HOES on magazines like “Stuff”.  While those pictures on magazines are nice to look at keep in mind that they can use a computer to make the elephant man into a beautiful women.  Just remember you are THE REAL THING  :)<br>

WOOHOO MY TEAM GERMANY WON TODAY :)<br>

<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>Hey guys, a favor:<br>
<br>
Don't even give that guy who posted that stuff any notice.  It'll just feed his ego.  Just ignore him completely, that's far more effective.<hr>steven colby said on Fri Jun 21 2002 <br>hey i know pat ziagos very well and i know he would never of posted that crap.... dont worry well find out who it is..... i have a couple ideas who it is...... and dont diss clark summit players.<hr>Suann Robinson said on Sun Jun 23 2002 <br>Whoa!  There I am!  :)  Thanks for all the lovely compliments... and to the person who wondered how old I am... Look on the calendar.. I'm 20.  (perve)  Anyway, since I didn't see the rude comment people are discussing, I will just say that I don't really care what anyone has to say about my photos, my ethnicity, or otherwise.  I didn't submit my pics to show off or make anyone uncomfortable.  Can't wait to see the next month's calendar guys!!<hr>jason baretta said on Mon Jun 24 2002 <br>nice job, to both Neal and Suann. Nice to see the DT community coming together<hr>Andrew Howard said on Mon Jun 24 2002 <br>Thanks to you Suann for doing such a great job, and for bravely being the first DT Calendar Girl :)<hr>Cat Ceder said on Mon Jun 24 2002 <br>I'll follow the flock here, Suann congrats on being the first female for the DT Calander, it's good to see that this is getting some views.<br>
<br>
Now if only we can get Tuili to pose for the next one. ~winkwink~ just kidding Tuili.<br>
<br>
GREAT JOB to everyone that's worked on this Calander, can't wait for the next one.<hr>Tiuli Anfossi said on Tue Jun 25 2002 <br>I would of but I was in Mexico with no internet and was away while they asked.  Whenever that scanner of mine decides it like windowsXP, I will show you my pics from my mexico trip, Cat.  Anyways talk to you probably Wed on AIM. <hr>Mike Humphries said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>So i guess this little Project was a HIT.  But I know you all want to see some skin from New Jersey...   I wanna see Steven Colby as the next calendar "person"....  Lets hear it for Steve Colby, c'mon son break out the speedo  :-)<hr>Suann Robinson said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>Yes... is there ever going to be a DT calendar dood?  :)  I would love to see some of the guys!  :: hubba hubba :: lol...<hr>Matt Berta said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>Umm... no. No doods, thankyouverymuch. I agree that Tiuli should be next.<hr>Matt Murray said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>"Here's to you, Suann Robinson, DeckTech loves you more than you will know..."<br>
<br>
I can't believe nobody did that before now :)<br>
<br>
Seriously, I love the calendar and I look forward to the next one, whoever decides to be on it.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>I've thought about doing a guys one too.  I just wonder if there would be enough interest.<br>
<br>
Hey i've got an idea, maybe it should be like a "calendar couple"?  Like in high school, one guy and one girl.  That might be cool.<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>Having just one guy to a page would be really goofy. I say Convention picks our something like that would be really neat, how 'bout it Neal? I'm sure there will be plenty of Origins pics.<hr>steven colby said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>sure ill be in your calendar with my grilfrined but ithink my girlfrined would be of more interest since she plays also...... you should have mike humphries as MR. August waht a stud<hr>steven colby said on Wed Jun 26 2002 <br>sure ill be in your calendar with my grilfrined but ithink my girlfrined would be of more interest since she plays also...... you should have mike humphries as MR. August waht a stud<hr>Mike Humphries said on Thu Jun 27 2002 <br>Sure steve I will be Mr. August.  however i have one stipulation...  you have to wear a Gold Bikini and do the whole Princess thing...  HA HA HA HA <hr>Suann Robinson said on Sat Jun 29 2002 <br>Oh...that is a great idea Mike and Steve!  :D  While we're at it, maybe Phobos will dress up for December... in snowy white speedos?  Hrm... Yeah!  I like that...
