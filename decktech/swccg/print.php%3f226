Organizer: Dan Tibbles dan@cardhaus.com<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Aug 8 2002 <br>At this point, there are like 20+ tournaments planned, it's intense.  This should be a really fun one.<hr>Alan Sagan said on Thu Aug 8 2002 <br>I will be 21 for this tournement, which means we won't have to drive up to canada for me to have a good time.. :)  Unless of course, hoostino is looking to get into a topless only strip club... <hr>Casey Barson said on Thu Aug 8 2002 <br>I'm going to be there, along with several of the top rated Utah folk just to give the rest of you a taste of what Tech we have down here in the desert!!<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Aug 8 2002 <br>Casey, i was going to include you too and Team Utah, but i hadn't talked to you in a bit.  Glad to hear you can make it<hr>Michael Pistone said on Thu Aug 8 2002 <br>When is there going to be a DPC New England or New York?<hr>Doug Kitzman said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>I'm fairly sure you expect atleast a few guys from the Oregon crew to be there. I'm not sure i'll have the money to make it though i'd love to go. Still I have only played in like one tournament in the last year so I bet i'd get owned if I did go heh.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>That was my other group I didn't mention, due to lack of contact.  All of portland, Forcelord, etc, i remember you all used to have an intense tournament scene.<br>
<br>
DPC Philly will be the big event for the NE.  <b>Mike Carr</b> is one of the best guys I know, he'll be running it.  It's got a few kinks to work out, then it's in.<hr>Alan Sagan said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>So when is some proper scheduling coming up?  I know there have been times all I could do was fly in for what day.. If I was in that situation, I'd like to know what day i should be around (although I expect I'll probably be around the whole time...)<hr>Kyle Krueger said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>There will be some people from seattle there, including myself, even though none of u know who I am.  Keith Watabayashi, the endor regional champion will probably not be able to make it though.  Steven Harpster will be there, too.  He got like 17th at f-con last year.<hr>Ricky Martinez said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>Hey I was just told DPC Houston wasnt sanctioned? Is this true and why? It was scheduled, are DPC's not sanctioned?  Is this one gonna be sanctioned?<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>It's up to Kyle and Steve to represent Seattle at the DPC...stupid college.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>Of course they are sanctioned.  Who told you that?  Or are you making that up?  Write me and tell me who told you that<hr>Doug Kitzman said on Fri Aug 9 2002 <br>Portland still has a fair amount of Tournaments but I live 4 hours from there out in the middle of no where, so it is rare when I can make the drive up there to get in a tournament. The last tournament I played in was the Endor Regional and before that I played just after Coruscant came out. <hr>Nathan Russell said on Sat Aug 10 2002 <br>If anyone from the Eugene area is going up (or is passing through Eugene on their way), I'd love to get a ride up there, if possible.<br>

If anyone's passing through the Vancouver, WA area and can give me a ride, PLEASE let me know!<hr>Cortney Haggerty said on Sat Aug 10 2002 <br>holy cow...there sure are a lot of broke mofs up in the great north west.  good luck- ill be there with bells on.<hr>Doug Kitzman said on Sat Aug 10 2002 <br>Hey David unless something strange happens Don is going up there so if you get the money give him a call and i'm sure he'll be willing to take you again.<hr>Sol O\ said on Sat Aug 10 2002 <br>Good it's in Seattle. Only a little drive away from me because I am Canadian<hr>Jared Stein said on Sun Aug 11 2002 <br>Oh Yeah. I'm going to try to talk Gav into driving up there with me for this one. <hr>Matt Lush said on Mon Aug 12 2002 <br>Back from Florida, Sanibel rocks...I'll try to hit this one, can we get some solid info on it? "One month mark" is kinda shady, I need details, details!<hr>Alan Sagan said on Tue Aug 13 2002 <br>What matt said.<hr>steven Harpster said on Tue Aug 13 2002 <br>I "Steven Harpster" will be going along with one of my team mates Kyle Krueger. Our other teammate Keith Watabayashi will not be able to show to the tournament :(, So I am gonna win it in his honnor. :)<hr>Arian Delisle said on Tue Aug 13 2002 <br>like matt said we need more details! <hr>Legolas Greenleaf said on Wed Aug 14 2002 <br>hey, that's cool.  I wish I could go, but I live in Olympia with no way to get up there (unless somebody could give me a ride or something).  I could win the "Biggest Scrub of the DPC" award or something :)<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Aug 14 2002 <br>legolas try to catch a ride, cause it's going to be really good.<br>
<br>
I should have the final schedule tomorrow.  Dan's setting up all kinds of great tournaments, a lot of them as a matter of fact.
