But that's what you get when you work on 2 hrs of sleep and people are telling you that you're not doing your job (where's that Podracer text, damn it?!).<hr>RedV said on Sat Mar 17 2001 <br>so someone is actually payed to write these "articles"<br>

I volunteered a few months ago and have been updating this site w/ Decipher news ever since. I made my first mistake last week and I'm sorry.

What is Decipher thinking in?.<hr>IhateWOTC said on Wed Apr 11 2001 <br>Garion, shut up. You people will complain about anything D does, wont you? What? Mara's Saber is Purple? I hate D. What? Jar-Jar is a 3 3? I hate D. What? Anakin's Podracer sucks even though I dont know S H I T about the entire Podracing theme. Screw off. I'd like to see you do better.<hr>Jon Cates said on Wed Apr 18 2001 <br>I feel I must share my opinion on a very delicate matter: that of the underuse of Kessel Run in WYS decks. Everybody's puttin' Dash in his ship which seriously limits Kessel Run. I say just go with other dudes in their ships leave the Outrider out of this!<hr>Aniken ;) said on Sun Jun 10 2001 <br>Podracing sucks!!!
