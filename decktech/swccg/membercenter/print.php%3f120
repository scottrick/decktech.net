Decipher plans to award $10,000 to the SW:CCG World Champion at DecipherCon 2002. <br>
<br>
Under the current plan the SWCCG World Championships will be a two-day event at DecipherCon 2002. In the coming weeks be sure to stay tuned here for more information on how you can qualify for the SW:CGG World Championship. Along with the $10,000 for Star Wars CCG, Warren also spoke of plans to provide $1,000 each for Young Jedi CCG and Jedi Knights TCG. <br>
<br>
No mention was made about the prizes for the World Champion of Decipher's latest blockbuster, Lord of the Rings TCG, but if the generous support promised for SW:CCG is any indication we can bet the prizes for LotR will be huge!<br>
<br>
With the release of the new Star Wars Trading Card Game and the ability to play SW:CCG for serious prizes, without buying more cards, 2002 might be the largest gaming year for Star Wars gamers to date.<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Michael Girard said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>yes, stay tuned to all of your normal news sources on the web for more information of whats to come in 2002 in terms of SWCCG.

<br>
DecipherCon 2002 is a go. Obviously, not everyone agreed with my decision to cancel the 2001 event because of 9/11, but we all know those were extraordinary circumstances. I can't see that happening again.<br>
<br>
Warren<hr>Matt Lush said on Thu Feb 7 2002 <br>We'll have glass, right Mr. Holland? :)<hr>Casey Barson said on Thu Feb 7 2002 <br>I would love a regional.  Not only do I have Brian Hunter included in that, but also Hayes Hunter as well.  I can't wait to school them both and then win my money at D-con.  I'll see everyone there!!<hr>Stephen McLaughlin said on Thu Feb 7 2002 <br>I've got $5 that says there *is* no DecipherCon 2002. Let's see them give out ten large then!<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Fri Feb 8 2002 <br>sorry to dissapoint, casey, but i'm out.  i have literally 0 desire to touch a SW card.  besides, chances are the regional will be during the summer too, which means i'd be back in mass.  i dunno..<hr>John Arendt said on Fri Feb 8 2002 <br>Hayes - we'll see the official announcement today from Mike G, but we're hoping to get the Regional season underway in April.  Don't think I can pull venues / TDs together before then.  I'm sure Tatooine will be early - you gotta play on the hopes of another Hunter v Hunter match-up.  Think about the fans, wouldja!  Besides, sounds like Barson wants a beating!  <br>
(I should talk - he schooled me last time)<hr>Marcus Tinaro said on Fri Feb 8 2002 <br>It would seem that ignorance has rose to the top of the Star Wars players cup of tea once again.  I must impart my view of this ten thousand dollar charade.  It would seem that Decipher is still allowed to sell the Star Wars products for a little bit longer.  There is no better way to encourage more spending by players than to offer a ten thousand dollar prize.  Now on to the charade part.  After the alotted time for Decipher to sell Star Wars cards has passed a cancellation of the ten thousand dollar prize will be in order.  Decipher will of course say that it continuing to support these Star Wars card games, but it does not turn a profit for them after they can no longer sell product.  Once there is no way to make profit there is no reason to continue to support the game.  Decipher is of course hoping most gamers are a bit dim witted when trying to pass this by players right after Decipher did it in November.  I guess I will continue to bring the players up to speed since most can not put one and one together and get two.  The cancellation of DecipherCon 2001 was a direct result of the oncoming loss of the Star Wars CCG to Wizards of the Coast.  There is no reason to give away large amounts of money for prizes if there will not be a way to recoup this money with new product sales.  So as a stunned player at home as I now know you are, come to realize that this in not all just to support the Star Wars products Decipher put out.  It is rightfully so just to turn another dollar at the players expense.  In parting I ask you this one question.  If you wanted to support the SWCCG why did you not offer this sort of prizes during the 1999 DecipherCon, the 2000 DecipherCon, or during the first world championships?  I am afraid that too little too late would be a lot to hope for from Decipher.<hr>Marcus Tinaro said on Fri Feb 8 2002 <br>I almost forgot something.  I must admit that the LOTR card game, and roleplaying have been handle by Decipher as well.  These are both great products, and receive great support form Decipher.  Decipher has definitely earned a large amount of experience from publishing the Star Wars CCG, and is doing everthing they can to avoid repeating SWCCG mistakes.  This is what will make DecipherCon 2002 great.  Constant updates to the faq, and great game design continue to be Decipher's strong suit, but as I have been amazed at the support the LOTR CCG has been given.  I hope that my previous post is all just bitter opinion and that Decipher continues to support SWCCG, but I am a realist.  I am currently fearing the onset of a dice based CCG from wizards as I write.  Good Luck and I hope I am wrong.<hr>Luca Costanzo said on Sat Feb 9 2002 <br>any word on if D will pay airfare for an australian representative?  they wouldn't pay for one to freedomcon last year, but this is a Dcon ...<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Tue Feb 12 2002 <br>Bastian is right.  Just because the US has more players does not mean we should have more teams.  This is World Cup format, after all.  And I like the fact that's in Germany and not the states.  Decipher did say: "Players will need to pay for their own accommodations and trip to the World Cup. (Decipher will have more information at a later date on team sponsorships through various companies). "<br>
<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Feb 12 2002 <br>i agree. if lotr is to get real big it can't just concentrate on the US player base.<hr>Scot Vales said on Sat Feb 23 2002 <br>I noticed that the title of the article uses a question mark instead of an exclamation point.  Could it be that instead of excitement over this, we are meant to question the reality of it?<br>
<br>
I do.  <br>
I'll admit some natural skepticism when reading anything from Decipher. <br>
Here's the thing though:<br>
The last six months we have defending (or attacking) Decipher because they made a decision that was made because they are a business.  (We knew this when we bought the cards and we know it now.)  Decipher itself claimed that they not only work for the fans but also to please their buyers (after all, that's what a business does).  <br>
Where is the good economic advantage in giving away $10,000?  Consider that they are no longer have SWCCG buyers to please!<br>
Is it possible for them to make $10,000 off SWCCG players by D-Con or have the hope that they will make $10,000 between SWCCG purchases before D-Con and as a result of the consumer relations of giving away $10,000?  This seems highly doubtful.<br>
With this in mind, I am greatly skeptical if Decipher keeps it's word for the $10,000 grand prize.  I invite them to prove me wrong.  They will smooth over some of my hard feelings and suspicion if they go through with it.<br>
But, of course, it would be foolish to do that.  I, Scot Vales, do not play any other Decipher games nor do I purchase Decipher product anymore (It's no longer distributed, right?).  <br>
<br>
The end of the comment is this:<br>
1) Decipher will prove itself unreliable again--which is bad for business<br>
OR<br>
2) Decipher will throw away the sum of money equal to $10,000 minus whatever meager sales they make between now and then--which is bad for business<br>
<br>
A question mark seems very appropriate.
