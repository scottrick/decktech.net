I listened to them damn thing myself.  Here's what we've got (I make no spelling guarantees).<hr>Fisher said on Sun Apr 8 2001 <br>yeah, nice link. it doesn't worK!<hr>Garion said on Sun Apr 8 2001 <br>Hey Sonn if the 2 rebel cards are as you write them, they are simply GREAT!!!!!!!!!.<hr>Jason said on Mon Apr 9 2001 <br>thanks sonn<hr>5D6-RA7 said on Tue Apr 10 2001 <br>A Million Voices is a great card. SYCFA will get a boost. Enough to flip? Probably. But, I don't think it will be #1.<hr>Fisher said on Wed Apr 11 2001 <br>I think that SYCFA will be a good deck. I was thinking, NON-SYCFA decks that can screw any deck but space, then have a strong space force, and you have an unstopable beast!<hr>TanDjo said on Fri Apr 13 2001 <br>Info or intox ? :-)<br>
