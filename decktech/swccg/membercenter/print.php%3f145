The Players Hall of Fame is designed to honor those whose accomplishments are <br>
unquestionable.  They have preformed well at major tournaments, have created <br>
famous decks, and/or have maintained a high rating in their region.  The Hall <br>
of Fame is not meant to slight or insult anyone who is not nominated or <br>
inducted into it.  We recognize that there are many players who if <br>
circumstances were different may have accomplished feats comparable to the <br>
ones accomplished by those nominated.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
It is also the Nominating Committee's goal to honor those who had an <br>
undeniable impact on the game, but not necessarily through tournament <br>
performance or deck building.  They have helped promote and improve the game, <br>
not only in their local area, but beyond.  Here is the initial list of those <br>
nominated.  Again, any constructive criticism is welcome.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
David Akers<br><br>
John Arendt<br><br>
Kevin Ch'ng<br><br>
Mike Girard<br><br>
Justin Pakes<br><br>
Neal Razi<br><br>

<br>
<br><br>
Thanks for your time.  With your help, we hope to honor those who made Star <br>
Wars CCG the greatest CCG to date.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Nominating <br>
Committee<br>

Edmund Gray<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed Mar 20 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>Great work guys, you're doing an incredible job.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>even though he's mad that i was busting on warren holland, i might nominate Jim Colson for the second category.  He was around right from the beginning and did trememdous amounts to promote the game.  Are tournament directors allowed?<hr>Jonathan Chu said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>Scott Lingrell should definitely be on the second list, if not on the first, for RamapoCons. I can't think of anyone else who has undertaken a task of such magnitude, not once or twice, but three times. <hr>Emerson Sklar said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>I think i should be in it just because.... Not really, that would be really selfish. I loved it, but i was not that distinguished. I like your choices, i think you covered most of the people.  Too bad i didn't start earlier, maybe i too could have been on there.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>I would like to nominate Jeff Holmes of Denver, North Carolina.<br>
<br>
Jeff started in Star Wars ccg at day 1, has been a Regional Winner, World Finalist, Tournament Director, Squadron Member, and a great ambassador for this game. As many changes as the game has gone through, he has never given up on it and was a real innovator in the early days before Operatives...lol.<br>
<br>
He has beaten quite a few members on the list above and win or lose, he will always say good game and shake your hand. A true sportsman.<br>
<br>
He has taught many people to play in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina.<br>
<br>
There are many that have done alot for this game but Jeff is truly deserving of induction in the Star Wars Hall of Fame.<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>For the Northwest, I would like to see Doug Taylor for the second category. And for the first category, I think John Hawkins NEEDS to be there.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>I agree with Chu 100%...  get Lingrell's name up there.<hr>Darryll Silva said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>for the list of undeniable impacts where is Cali TD Mike Hardy. This guy has banged out the small stuff and has helped run bigger tournies not putting it past him for shadow squad and helping me organize regionals this year and other great contributions to the game<hr>Clayton Atkin said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>For the 2nd list, I feel that Carl "Mike" Hardy warrents a nomination.  Through the years, nobody on the west coast has worked harder, and put more hours into this game than he has.  <hr>edmund gray said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>ok, Lingrell is definatly on. probably Hardy, Homes, Taylor, and Colson as well.<hr>Doug Faust said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>You might want to consider Tim Courtney for the 2nd category...<hr>Carson Swanek said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>I nominate Brad Rinehold- until recently he's been living in South Carolina, where hardly anybody plays, but he's recently come up to North Carolina and quickly took the top ranking in the state.  In the ~8 months he's been here, I know of only 4 or 5 times he's been beaten.  He was the inventor of the post R3 numbers deck and was in the final 8 in worlds this year.  He has also founded the #1 decktech team website, Team Carolina, and has been invaluable as a tournament director and peer at many events in my area.<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>well...we're trying to look for players who have done well for more than one year (except World Champs).<hr>Tim Guzman said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>This list looks good, but somehow a little small.  It seems those that make it should be that amount.<hr>Clayton Atkin said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>It seems that to be able to make this list, one has to fall into at least one of 3 catagories.  World Champion, number 1 in the world for a good amount of time, or winning at least 2 majors.  With that in mind, 2 names pop into my head that seem to be missing.....Ray Bordier and Tim Guzman.  <hr>Justin Desai said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>word lingrell has to be there...what about chu?  I think he's beaten almost every player on the hall of fame list.  <hr>Jacob Taylor said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Justin Warren and John Sneed should be on there, because they dominate the state of Texas.  And as we all know, Texas breeds the best CCG players.  ;-)<br>
Yannick should also be on the U.S. list, because he's just that good.<hr>john matrix said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>I 2nd that chu should be on the list. I don't recall ever losing to him in a tourney,but he is still damn good :) Yannick is on the other list(non-us) :)<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Chu most certainly is supposed to be on the list. I don't how I forgot him, my apologies.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>I just want to comment on the class of this list. Notice, if you will, that it's not just composed of pro-decktechers. It's got those from DT, several pro-Decipher (and anti-DT), and a few caught in the middle. This is a great looking list, all around. Very classy, guys. Except Chu should most definitely be on the list! Who missed that one? ;-)<hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Chu was on the list his omission must be a typo. Sorry about that. <hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Also, just to reiterate:<br><br> We really can't nominate "woulda, coulda, shoulda" players. If a player labored long in obscurity, that is not a qualification for the Hall of Fame. Neither is local success. Neither is having beaten top players in local play. All of those things are great achievements and  not being nominated is not a knock on anyone's quality as a player or as a human being. If circumstances were different for some people, I am sure the list would be different.<br><br> <br>
We have tried to set the bar pretty high. To honor those nominated, it has to be somewhat exclusive.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>if you are going to put this to a vote of some sort, i recommend you at least give us a sentance explaining why someone was nominated.<br><br>nominating ghetto squad and team albany is lame. the players stand out by themselves.<hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>We are not yet putting this thing to a vote. Right now we are fielding the nomination list in order to make sure there are no serious omissions (like Chu). After review of any feedback we get from this page, we will post the selection method. We are not yet sure what format and how much Bio info we will publish. <br><br><br>
As to the "Lame" ness of nominating teams -- The more accomplished members of the teams have been nominated separately. Recognition of the members as a group seems appropriate in these to cases because they have both achieved somewhat legendary status as groups. <br><br><br>
  <hr>Clayton Atkin said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>I agree with Evan.  Ghetto squad and Team Albany stand out because of the players in each of their respective groups.  You cannot nominate them for what they did as a whole, because what they did was make eachother better players induvidually through competition.  <br><br>
<br><br>
The '27' Yankees are not in the baseball hall of fame as a team, but you'll find that most of their members are.  That takes nothing away from what they accomplished together.  <hr>Jim Colson said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Jonathan Chu... Definately in the first Group.<br>
<br>
Doug Taylor & Carl "Mike" Hardy .. Definately in the 2nd group.<br>
<br>
and no Neal, I'm not mad at you, never have been.  Just having a good discussion is all. (BTW thanx for the nomi)<br>
Jim<hr>jason wade said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>I agree with jim on this one. johny chu should be up there.<hr>Martin Akesson said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>there are some names on the list that i dont recognize, while others i maybe think should be on the list are not there. so it will be cool to see the explainations! also, i agree that nominating teams are a bit strange, because it feels like being a team is just a way to tell others who your mates are. am i wrong? if i am wrong, i nominate the martin-yannik-raph team and the martin-bastian team.<hr>Michael Hawley said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>Ok. Edwin said it. I said it:<br><br> <br>
Chu is nominated!<br> <br>
Chu is nominated!<br> <br>
Chu is nominated!<br> <br><br>
If you don't like the fact that there are teams on the nominee list, don't vote for them when the time comes. If you want to see information, why don't you guys submit the specific qualifications of people who should be nominated? Make a case, 'So and So made the finals at worlds x number of times, won x number of major tournaments, was the top rated player for x years" that kind of thing.  <br><br><br>
 <hr>Jonathan Chu said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>Thanks for the nomination and support guys. I appreciate it a lot!<hr>Scott Lingrell said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>You like me, you really, really like me :)  Great Idea with the HOF Ed, Clint and Mike!!!  <hr>edmund gray said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>whose edwin? :)<hr>Michael Hawley said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>He's a typo, sorry. I know your name Edmund. I had been talking to my son Edward about his friend Edwin (honest - lives in our building) and I got my Eds mixed up. <hr>edmund gray said on Fri Mar 22 2002 <br>Well, since no one seems to like the teams (except the nominating committee), I guess they'll probably be removed.<hr>Brian Hunter said on Sun Mar 24 2002 <br>I'll chip in and agree with everyone else that commented on how silly the team nominations are.  Get those out of there.  That gives you a nice round 25 players on the nominee list.  (counting Chu)  <hr>Scot Vales said on Sun Mar 24 2002 <br>I would like to nominate Steve Marshall.  I will list the reasons why from what I consider to be least to most influential contributions.<br>
<br>
1) He played decks that were creative and encouraged players to adapt and play more creatively themselves.<br>
<br>
2) He brought more players into the game than I can count and also introduced many to Young Jedi.<br>
<br>
3) Through his comments in local listserves and on Decktech, he has tried to get players to think about the game and its relationship to Decipher more than anyone else I know.<br>
<br>
4) Most importantly, we have all heard of tracking.  We have been told it is imperative to being a "great" player as compared to a "good" player.  Steve is the only person I know of that makes the skill of tracking accesible, in some form, to every player.  Anyone can read his first article and learn to track cards.  He then provided advanced articles to those who really wanted to work on it.  I know of no other player that has added to strategy and playing as much as Steve.  I have often seen him take time both locally and when he has travelled to teach inexperienced and upcoming  players how to become better through mastery of card manipulation and circulation.  On Decktech, where derogetory comments are par and those who do not understand a strategy are condemed, Steve lifts up players by helping others actually learn to be better players by understanding how to manipulate these sixty pieces of cardboard.<br>
<br>
Scot Vales<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>I'm not really more than an observer on the HOF nominating committe, but I want to say I consider Steve to definitely be one of the best DeckTechers ever.  He's an excellent writer, outstanding player, great promoter of swcccg and an even better guy.<hr>Kyle Craft said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>Wow, I made the list.  I figured people had forgotten that I even played the game.<hr>Chris Gogolen said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>Here's my 2 cents.  How does Chris twig make the list and not Brian?  They are both great players with a lot of accomplishments.  Both should be on the list.  Also, John Hawkins should be there-he has done quite a bit over the years and has been over 2000 for as long as I can remember, and the same goes for Michael Dalton.  Both have created some solid decks, shared them with the rest of us, and performed exceptionally well at major events.  Add those 3 guys to the list.  They deserve the nomination for their years of hard work and achievements.<hr>Doug Kitzman said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>I also agree that Hawkins should be on there. Also I think my brother Don Kitzman should be on there he has been a top dog in the Endor region for a long time plus he's a DPC winner and if i'm not mistaken isn't every other DPC winner on that list?<hr>edmund gray said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>Ok, John Hawkins can go on.<hr>Scot Vales said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>I wish to know the intention of the nominations.  One group of opinions seem to wish to honor the big winners.  The other group seems to honor those who added to the game as a whole and had a hand in its growth/development/playability.  <br>
<br>
My opinion is that we need to honor the latter group as they are far more unsung than those that won this or that tournament.  (Not to discount that achievement but they had their 15 minutes of fame and it's someone else's turn.)<br>
The introduction written at the top by the Nominating Comittee seems to lend both views credence.  Perhaps both can be honored.<br>
<br>
The Ithorian<hr>edmund gray said on Mon Mar 25 2002 <br>ummm...in case it's not clear, we are honoring both players and "contributors" seprately.<hr>Ryan Newman said on Tue Mar 26 2002 <br>I think that John Hawkins and Chris Denoma need to be there on at least the second list. Those guys are two awsome players.<hr>Gabriel Alonso said on Tue Mar 26 2002 <br>I can't belive you guys have forgotten me already. What about me?<br>
<hr>Tom Kathman said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>What about me.........Waht about <br>
RAVEN!!! <br>
<br>
 ;oP<hr>Tom Kathman said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>JK guys.....the list is actually a tight list for sure :o)<hr>Gabriel Alonso said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>I wasnt kidding.<hr>john matrix said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>Gabe is a freaken CHAMP. Get him on the list.<br>
<br>
Brian<hr>Matt Lush said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>Gabe definitely needs to be on it. I feel bad for forgetting him, but hey pal, that's what you get for retiring so damn early! ;)<hr>Casey Barson said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>I have to agree and put Chu on there.  He's done so much traveling and done so well so many times he deserves it.  The list looks pretty good.  Can't think of anyone else so rock on!!<br>
<br>
PS Who is this Kyle Craft?  Did he even play SW?<br>
<br>
PPS Just kidding Kyle!<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>CHU IS  NOMINATED<hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>Thanks for the good words, guys. *g* I still remember calling a judge over to our game against a new guy, Ryan, because "he's using my articles against me!" ;-)<br><br>
<br>
In all reality, bringing everyone up to my level of tracking makes my games more challenging, which also makes my games more fun. And the fun is what it's all about. This is a GAME, after all! :-)<hr>phil stevens said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>I think Chu should be on the list.<hr>maxim briand said on Sat Mar 30 2002 <br>Please take out Alex Klammrodt i ams orry but in no way does he deserve to be there. <hr>Tim Guzman said on Sat Mar 30 2002 <br>I think we should start a petition to put Chu on the list :) OH wait, I am sorry it was already done.  And even expressed loadly, so we all should know.  Yet we keep saying to add him.  Now that is funny.  Sorry my fellow friends, but I have been drinking, and I found this funny...now off to other things.<hr>Wizard 923 said on Sat Mar 30 2002 <br>These are just Aussie names that do deserve a mention, maybe there not "high profile" enough, but were there from the start and helped in more ways than many down here..<br><br>
Adam Amy - Yaggle Gaggle!!<br><br>
Luka Constanza - The man of many cards *and deck ideas*, and willing to let everyone borrow them.<hr>Raphael Asselin said on Sat Mar 30 2002 <br>I don`t see the purpose of this question... is that really what people want.. people already know who did good or not.. anyway... oh yeah.. by the way.. if Alex Klamroth is nominated.. I would like to have Mxim Briand nominated.. why.. because he was the first one to make a 8-0 in a major convention (Day of continental) .. hehe.. that better than what Klamroth ever accomplished..<hr>Brian Hunter said on Mon Apr 1 2002 <br>I think Scott Gaeta should be a lock for the 2nd category.  He's probably done more for SWCCG tournaments than anyone else in Colorado.  Heck, he's probably done more for SWCCG tournaments than most Decipher employees.  For any "Open", DPC, Prerelease, or anything else SWCCG-related that goes on in Colorado, he's directly involved.  For many years, he ran tournaments in his store with consistency that would rival any TD in the world.  He remains an active part of the SWCCG community, having started up the GPN website (which is where everyone first saw the new virtual cards), and he will also be in charge of sending out prize support for the PC.  When you go to a tournament, and get booster packs or tournament foils, this is the guy who made it happen.  If players can't appreciate that, then what WOULD they appreciate?
