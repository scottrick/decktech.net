<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>New Features for DeckTech posted by DeckTech on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Here's two new useful features available only to DeckTech members, from the brains behind the site, Neal Razi and David Akers.<br>
<br>
First is our <b>Subscription Service</b>.  Have a favorite player or deckmaker?  When you subscribe to a member, you will receive a D-mail informing you whenever that member submits a Deck, Article or Tournament Report.  Now it's faster and easier to keep up with the best info and your best mates.  To subscribe to someone, just go to their <b>Member Page</b>(via the Member Directory or from clicking on their name nearly anywhere on the site).  There you'll see a link to either Subscribe to this person, or to Unsubcribe if you feel the need.  Also, when submitting something, you'll now see how many subscribers you have!  Always a good way to compare bragging rights as to who's the top deck designer!<br>
<br>
Also, still in testing, you can now <b>Rate the reviews</b> you've received (decks only for now).  You can use this to either reward a useful review or heap disdain on a bad one!  You'll see a link next to each review of your submissions.  Click the link to get started.  Note that there ARE small tech point penalties and bonuses involved here!  So start helping out, and write those helpful reviews.  Who knows... There may even be a reward to the person that writes the most useful reviews...  and there may be a smackdown to the one who writes the most worthless reviews!<br>
<br>
Note that for now, these features are available only on the new format card games, meaning Lord of the Rings and Magi-Nation Duel.<br>
<br>
At DeckTech, we are committed to bringing the players the most creative and innovative information exchance, the hottest new web technology and the best card network web domain on the Net!  We take this committment seriously, and have more surprises planned, so keep checking back.  <br>
<br>
Enough talk!  Stop lurking, sign up, submit some stuff and let the fun begin!<br>

I can't wait to lay the smackdown on the people who write the really dumb reviews!<hr>rayc said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>This is great, Neal. Both subscription and rate the reviews sound  great. I may have to start playing one of those games just to try out the new features. <hr>Ooryl said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Damn, wish you guys were doing this for Wars too, then I could put the smack on people who rate my old decks badly saying they're no longer viable in the current enviornment.<hr>neal said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Oh, when we get a chance we'll try to switch star wars over to the new format.  It's just that me and david always have about ten things we want to do at a time.<hr>Bane Slader said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Can not wait for the MND site to be up.  Any time frame as to when it will be going?<hr>David said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Look for an annoucement in a day or two about that.<hr>The TIck said on Wed Jan 9 2002 <br>Neat idea.  I really like that.<hr>Ooryl said on Thu Jan 10 2002 <br>Cool, thanks.  Good work guys.<hr>Rogue Nine said on Fri Jan 11 2002 <br>i don't like rate the reviews . . . it really ends up being which reviews you didn't like instead of which were the most helpful.<hr>David said on Sat Jan 12 2002 <br>I can see that that might happen. But I have been pleasantly surprised because several members gave good ratings to lower reviews because they were helpful. It works both ways.<hr>Wittens Hand said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>Its about time.. ive had several reviews where the person said that the deck sucked with no explanation. The ability to yell at those that review only to drop your decks rating so they can stay top ten is awsome.. its about frickin time!<hr>edmund said on Thu Jan 17 2002 <br>i agree i hate those pointless <hr>Pikachu87 said on Wed Jan 23 2002 <br>I think this is a great idea.  Now people can know exactly what the ppl who are good players set up and know what kinds of decks to build or what kinds of decks to defend against.  The rate the reviews thing is kinda pointless tho, or maybe I just don't understand it. <br>

To the Admins: Make the message box larger.<hr>Luca Costanzo said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>Great ideas!<br>

Whilst the review-review feature may result in people just slagging anyone who gives them less than a 4, it is probably a better solution than the current situation where I write a 3/4 page long review explaining why a deck is bad, what needs to be changed and why I gave it 3.5 stars only to have some stupid ingrate come and give my tournament winning decks 1/2 a star in 'revenge'.  The subscription idea is also fantastic.
