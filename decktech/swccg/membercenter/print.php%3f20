<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>DPC RAMAPOCON: BRING IT posted by DeckTech on Mon May 28 2001 <br>RamapoCon, which in recent years has become a veritable mecca for the Star Wars-playing community, is pleased to highlight the addition of a Decktech Players' Challenge to its already impressive third-year roster.  <br>
<br>
The DPC is slotted to begin 2pm sharp on Friday, June 8 at Ramapo College in Mahwah, NJ.  Decklists are required to be turned in to the directors by the tournament's start and checks will be conducted on every participant in random order throughout the day.  <br>
<br>
Eight games of regular play will be followed by a 1-game playoff among the top four players.  This playoff will pair 1st place versus 4th and 2nd versus 3rd with the highest player in each pairing choosing which side they use. After that the two remaining players will compete in a standard 2 game playoff for a total of 11 games.  <br>
<br>
As always, 1st place carries with it the $1000 prize, $200 for 2nd, and $150 each for 3rd and 4th. However, there will be enough other things going on at RamapoCon 3 to make a weekend stay worthwhile.  <br>
<br>
Follow up the DPC on Friday by competing in the Star Wars Open on Saturday, whose winner will receive a plane ticket to DecipherCon 2001 as well as a bye into Day 2.  The Star Trek Open will also  be held on Saturday, in addition to the RamapoCon Star Wars and Star Trek Team Championships which will begin immediately following the Opens.  <br>
<br>
Young Jedi and Jedi Knights Opens will be held on Sunday.  All of this in addition to the sealed deck, booster draft, No Such Thing As Luck, and other theme tournaments which will be running throughout the weekend!  <br>
<br>
And that's just the Decipher lineup... attendees will also be able to take part in scheduled roleplaying, live-action roleplaying, boardgaming, and other CCG's such as Magic, Raw Deal, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, and more.  <br>
<br>
Products will also be available in the dealer room for those looking to try something new or just expand their collections. RamapoCon 3 promises to be one of the largest and most exciting gaming conventions on the East Coast, with an international and coast-to-coast attendance and the promise of a weekend filled with fun, friends, and of course, cash prizes!  <br>
<br>
Don't miss out on this opportunity to be a part of a rapidly-expanding convention that only promises to get better with each year. For registration, event schedules, and other information, go to http://www.ramapocon.com. <br>
