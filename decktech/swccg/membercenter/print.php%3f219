<br>
my bday on the 4th Aug, if anyone wants to get me a geforce4, the new soulfly album or a box of RotEL. or a picnic.<hr>Hannah Grimm said on Sat Jul 20 2002 <br>My birthday is August 31st.<hr>sean vess said on Sat Jul 20 2002 <br>honestly, i have seen better looking women than munchkin. I mean a DOG is more attractive than her.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sat Jul 20 2002 <br>WTF? Someone seems to have a problem :P Its call an optometrist, go check one out and get some glasses ;)<hr>jason wade said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>lets just say he knows something you don't andrew.......<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>It is not your business to spread rumors about me on the internet. Grow up. You don't know what you're talking about. I guess you have a nice attraction for dogs then because I vaguely remember you telling everybody you were going to bone me at Origins. Catch your mouth before it runs away to where your pair can't keep up with it.<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>hey you watch your language little kid<hr>Dennis Jeffris said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>Well then... people here sure are angry at each other a lot.  I've never seen this 'Munchkin' girl, but I'm sure she's very pretty, and besides, it's DECKTECH and it's a TCG site!  It's not really designed as a modeling website.  But who knows?  I might be wrong - "Munchkin" might be the hottest chick ever, or maybe not.  But there's no need to insult people on here just cause you get off on it.  Or something.<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>Hey, let's get a couple things straight.<br>
<br>
One, if you can't say something nice, then keep your stupid #&!%ing mouth closed.  I will ban anyone who annoys me in this, and you can like it<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the next juvenile person who "spreads rumors" as Munchkin put it also earns a ban.<br>
<br>
Anyone who earns a ban is also eligible for an asskicking in person.<hr>Suann Robinson said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>GOODNESS!  Some people are horribly rude, and most of those types don't have any right to say what they do.  Hypocrites, all of them!<br>
<br>
On a better note, congratulations to all!  We are all priveleged with photos of Munchkin in August!  ::wahay!::<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see the pics, Munchkin.  :D<br>
<br>

From one calendar girl to another . . .<hr>Mike Kessling said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>To Sean and Jason:<br><br>You two need to shut the hell up. Do not talk shyte about my best friend unless you are willing to take a beating from me and my entire crew. If you value your health I would stay in Alabama and have sex with your sister and skip any convention that Team PCA is going to be at. <hr>will gilchrist said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>Jesus H. Christ folks, why are some of you so stupid?  You've probably never even seen this girl yet you're talking shiatt for no apparent reason.  And threatening to beat someone up for badmouthing a friend...? that's pretty dumb.  Just wait till you see them in person then wail on their ass so they won't be expecting it.  Anyway, I'm sure we can be more mature than the rest the gaming community.  Besides, arguing over the internet is like participating in the Special Olympics, even if you win you're still a retard (no offense intended to special olympics participants).<hr>Ryan Fojtik said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>ok look at it this way guys.. if u dont like the calendar.. dont download it.. <br>
<br>
plus since suann was beautiful, i have faith that neal didnt pick "the cave troll" to be on the next calendar.. anyway its all kinda silly.. munchkin seems like a good person, leave her alone.. <hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>Sorry, Will, but we've all met each other on more than one occaision so we are not just blowing steam out our cute little butts.<br>
<br>
¤Munchkin¤<br>
<hr>jason wade said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>you people jump to concusions on what I meant.... did I say anything bad about you munchkin? no. you assumed I ment something bad. sean is blowing off steam right now in the wrong place and I say sorry on his behave as well as mine. and mike I already can't make gencon cus of school but I will be in dragon and deciphercon. I have no intetion of starting any sort of fights but if you throw a putch at me first then be warned that you won't be able to throw a second one. all I was inplying is that sean has seen her and knows what she looks like so if he thinks that what she looks like well he is intitled to say so.....maybe not here but he can say it. either way sorry again.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>You little kids should keep your petty squabbles elsewhere, Decktech is such a friendly environment ;)<hr>will gilchrist said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>My bad Munchkin.  I didn't know that you've met, but I was trying to defend you anyway.  Kinda funny that I've never seen you and this Sean guy has even though I live like 15 min north of Duluth.<br>
Ryan: lol yeah I'm sure that Neal didn't pick the cave troll-funny shiatt.<br>
Jason: we've met before and you didn't strike me as a terribly threatening guy, so just stick with the appology and I'm sure everyone will forget about the misunderstanding.<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>Stop bickering ok? Everybody. Nobody wants to here this crap. <br>
Jason: You're backing out because you didn't expect people to jump on you for jumping on me. That's fine. I don't care what any of you think of me but if you want to take anything up with me, take it up with me instead of starting unneeded BS on this site, ok? Two more things: (1) Sean can apoligize for himself. If he's a big enough boy to call a woman a dog then he's a big enough boy to apoligize for himself. (2) Don't run your mouth on Kessling. Unless you plan on hitting a girl, don't put your money on getting anywhere near him. <br>
<br>
Will: No biggie, I was just straightening that out for you. Hey! I live in Duluth. What a coincidence! =P<br>
<br>
¤Munchkin¤<hr>Clint Hays said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>mike may not be able to hit you twice you ugly #&!%er but i can guaran-damn-tee you that i can.  you need to watch your #&!%in mouth talkin shyte about munchkin.  and your little boy sean vess needs to apologize...not only for being so mean to munchkin but for being a complete dumbass as well.<hr>Mike Kessling said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>My problem isn't really with you Jason. Sean on the other hand has some shyte coming to him. He is a little punk b!tch so I wouldn't get in the way of me or my team if we cross paths.<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>(yawn)<br>
<br>
does this remind you of anything? oh thats right the LAST calendar girl thread. its like watching replays of survivor or something.<br>
<br>
the guys who bashed the Munchkin are tossers, but the blokes who threaten to belt them are on the same level of analdom. when was the last time u heard of gamer geeks rolling a poodle let alone another gamer? in all the con reports, ive heard nothing about violence. no one's got the balls to talk crap like this in real life: doing so would get you chopped by vietnamese gangstas like 2 guys did here in melbourne. so shut the fcuk up. post more public holidays. have a nice day.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>my balls must be pretty big...i did hit someone at a card shop... damn what a bad gamer i am... but be cool guys, its no fun to fight<hr>Clay Wilburn said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>I think this has gone far enough. I apologize for the stupidity of the local gamers in my area. What they have done is childish and unacceptable. It is in the best interest of the Decktech community to ban the instigators of the fight and have all related comments removed from the forum. I fully support whatever action Neal takes. <hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>It's cool, clay, it seems to have blown over.  Let's just drop it.<br>
<br>
Any more birthdays or holidays?  Sounds like PIcnic day is something no one celebrates.<br>
<br>
Get 'em in now, I'm about finished.  Last time we missed Canada day...<hr>jason baretta said on Tue Jul 23 2002 <br>yeah, theres no such fÙcking thing as 'picnic day'.<br>
BTW giles, my b'day is on the 3rd 1 day after u.yup.<br>
<br>
Neal- I'm fairly positive the Australian continentals for lotr is gonna be the last weekend of August if u wanna throw it in.<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Tue Jul 23 2002 <br>Oh, so you know (even though he didn't post it), August 17th is Dominic's birthday. :) The big 21!! =^_^=<br>
<br>
¤Munchkin¤<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Tue Jul 23 2002 <br>hahahahha dead set, jason? with our powers combined, i think everyone on decktech should get us prezzies and hire strippers for us.<br>
<br>
btw, kevin said he wouldnt mind hosting a DPC in melb, but:<br>
1) do you really want kevin running a MONEY event like a DPC?<br>
2) do you really wanna hike 6 hrs by car down here?<br>
<br>
alternatively, we could meet in the middle and go with canberra, but theres nothing else to do there cept jerk off to hotel pr0n and spot politicians.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>jason baretta said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>its like this haakon.<br>
1) i can't seem to coordinate action between Neal and our TD Rob for reasons unknown to me.<br>
2) I'd rather chew glass than attend a DPC hosted by kevin<br>
3)With the continentals in Sydney its unlikly you or any other outer state players would bother to come to Sydney on 2 separate occaisions just to play cards.<br>
<br>
So i dunno, i guess i'll just wait for the fÙcking continentals, to be honest i can't be  fÙcked thinking about it.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>Two aussies - try to cool it with the f's ok?<br>
<br>
All you gotta do is get someone out there to WRITE ME.  I'll take it from their.  neal@decktech.net.  It shouldn't be hard to get you hooked up.<hr>william cruse said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>not that anybody cares, but my b-day is aug 7.  also, you morons from huntsville need to back off munchkin...so there.  see you guys at gen...<hr>Efridge Engelhardt said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>Sean Vess is by far one of the dumbest people on the planet, youll have you excuse him. I may be mistaken, but i think the sean your talking about munchkin is shawn martin, not sean vess (the boning at origins etc.) See you guys at GenCon.<br>
<br>
-efridge<hr>jason baretta said on Thu Jul 25 2002 <br>sorry about that neal<hr>Adam Beauchamp said on Thu Jul 25 2002 <br>Dear Kessling,<BR><BR>Do you want me to destroy these two randoms?<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR>Vincent Vega<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Thu Jul 25 2002 <br>theres an idea, jason...i wonder if we could MAKE a DPC our continentals...like, play for the bye etc, but with the cash thing thrown in too, cause we all know D gives out jack as prizes. could be sweet...<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu Jul 25 2002 <br>Prolly appropriate for this thread, Happy Birthday to Munchkin :)<hr>Heather Murphey said on Fri Jul 26 2002 <br>August, 11 is "Revolution!" Thats where we make peanut-butter and cheese sam'miches and skinny dip. Oh, It's also Vordai appreciation day since I'll never have the guts to submit my pics for this thingy<hr>jon smith said on Fri Jul 26 2002 <br>Munchkin I dont know you but have heard nice things from Clay, what Sean said here was bad form and believe me.. He will realize that this Saturday.<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Fri Jul 26 2002 <br>Awww, thank you Andrew. :)<hr>Raphael Asselin said on Sat Jul 27 2002 <br>I was wondering why i left the discussion board from many web site... seeing this crap just help me remember.  Anyway, if i can rant a little.  Why attack a girl if you aren`t one?.. anyway, no one touch that girl cause she is a friend of a friend, and friend of my friend are frined to me.. hum.. there is a lot of "friend" in this sentence my friend. heheh it so funny to tell our opinion.  anyway, might see some of you in Deciphercon, if i am able to make it..  And Neal, if you want a date for august. it will be my 9th anniversary with my girlfriend.. yep the same one that came in Tunisia with me back in 1997. 26th of august that is.<br>
<hr>jason baretta said on Sun Jul 28 2002 <br>giles, thats a nice idea for the players point of view, but i get the feeling the td is looking forward to a big payout :)<br>
at leats kevin isn't running it. last time it wa sin sydney, he took over and all he gave out was like 3 packs of freakin DS2<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Sun Jul 28 2002 <br>but they should be doing it cos they love the game, jason!! what more incentive is there apart from serving the game (ppfftttwhahahaa)...bloody money grubbers, no wonder no one plays in melb anymore...<br>
<br>
at any rate, its definitely gonna b last weekend of aug hey? know anywhere where i could crash over the w/end?<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Jul 28 2002 <br>You guys ever hear of email? Or hell, even dmail? :P<hr>Mark Balderston said on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>My birthday is August 15th.  Except I'm not prominent since I stopped playing LOTRTCG.  Oh well . . . I won a contest.   Maybe I'll come to Fcon or something.  Cheers.<hr>Robert Fletcher said on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>i'm not munchie-bashing, i just find this part of the mini-bio amusing: "...Rather than giving everything away, we'll just say that Munchkin is an attractive teenage Animal Lover with lots of interesting hobbies..."  I KNOW I'm not the only one to read that and laugh...<br>
<br>
<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>yeh i read that one and kept it to myself robert :)<br>
<br>
andrew - just making use of all the different forms of technology at my fingertips...hehe<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>John Garrett said on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>When is the actual release date of the calendar?  Thanks.<hr>Scott Manley said on Thu Aug 1 2002 <br>Well lets see...I payed $45.00 to get into Origins last month then payed another $10.00 just to play in a WOTC SWTCG tournament...and I did not even get a booster pack.....thanks for nothing Wizards.
