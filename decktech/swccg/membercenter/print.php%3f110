<br>
First, welcome to all Magi-Nation Players, the <a href="/magination">DeckTech Magi-Nation Duel</a> section is officially open.  <a href="http://www.magi-nation.com">Interactive Imagination</a>, the swell group of guys that puts out the card game(and Gameboy game) has given us a <a href="/ndpreview.php">sneak preview</a> of the card design history of Tryn, one of the Magi from their new expansion <b>Nightmare's Dawn</b>.  These will be released one every day until all 7 are out.<br>
<br>
Other game players on our network:  Do me and yourself a favor and check this game out.  It's really good, has lots of combos and extreme play but is really fun and easy to learn.  Go check out a couple decks and click on the card browser and get a gander at some of the images.  Also, give the players a warm welcome, like so many of us, they are a dedicated knowledgable core group of players.<br>
<br>
Next <b>Lord of the Rings</b> announcements.  The Founder will be reporting in later on our newest deck design contest, possibly the most exciting yet.  In conjunction with <a href="http://www.wizardworld.com/magazine.cfm?comm=base&mag=iq" target="newwindow">InQuest Magazine</a>, DeckTech's next contest winner will be getting their ad in print in InQuest and a cash prize!  This is an entirely new level for DeckTech members, and is a direct result of the quality of the submissions for which DeckTech members have become famous for.  Congratulations in advance to the winner of the contest and to all of you for bringing DeckTech to this point.  Check later on the <a href="/lotr">Lord of the Rings</a> section for the lowdown.<br>
<br>
Well, that's it, if that wasn't enough.  Get started!<br>
