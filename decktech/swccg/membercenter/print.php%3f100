THANX DT!<hr>duo_god_of_death said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>.................wow smiply stunning. I still would like to see a dbz one. <hr>minus said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>Well.. I come from the MN:D community, and this place looks really cool.. I hope this becomes popular with the MagiNation crowd!<hr>Gamer said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>In the Lancaster area, there is nobody that plays Magi-Nation. In the Harrisburg area, there is nobody that plays it, same in the Hummelstown, Hershey, Paxtonia, and other Centra PA areas.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, the game isn't that good.<br>
<br>
Raw Deal is a much better game, without a lot more skill involved then people think, plus it targets a more competitve player fan base.<br>
<br>
<hr>David said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>The game is really fun and just because no one plays it in PA where you live doesn't mean it isn't good. If I had a list of good ccgs you could buy right now MND would be near the top. That's not to say that Raw Deal isn't fun. It is a very fun game.<hr>neal said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>MND rocks, it really is a good game.  Also, I want to say it's nice to be working with professionals, the blokes there really have a top notch act.<hr>mc9457 said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>Uhm...no one in PA plays MagiNation?  I can think of 5 off the top of my head...3 in Lancaster, 1 in York, and 1 in Harleysville.<hr>zwitter said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>Neal and David know what there doing. if they say MND is good enuff 4 DT then, yeah<hr>Not Really Caring said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>.....<br>
<br>
Isn't there some other game worthy of Decktech's efforts?  I know of NO one who plays it, and the ONE shop in the area that has some has had the same dusty booster box since it was released.<br><br>
Raw Deal would've made a much better choice, I think.  I know the makers of MagiNation wanted the next Pokemon, but that will likely never happen again.<br><br>
Why not a retro area of Decktech where we can discuss games like Jyhad, ICE Middle Earth, e.t.c.?  I mean, there's likely just as many people still playing those as are Magi-Nation.<hr>David said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>Sorry to hear MND isn't popular in your area. It's a really fun ccg. It was also nominated for Inquest best new game of the year. Being a new game indicates it is on an upswing in growth rather than a down swing like some of the other games you mentioned. <br>
I agree that there won't be another pokemon fad craze any time soon though. Still we have plans to do Raw Deal check out the poll later today and vote for the next ccg on the network.<hr>edmund said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>its really cool to see what can happen when the company that makes the game helps out...<hr>Perhaps Caring a Little said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>So are you saying I should try out the game, David?  To me, I've judged it based on the kiddie artwork I've seen on the cards and the link with it and an animated show to push it.  Could someone perhaps give me the gist of the game very briefly?<hr>David said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>They have an animated show? I didn't know that. It's worth trying out if your a fan of all kinds of card games. I like the art it's some of the best looking stuff I have seen on cardboard. The game is simple to learn and has a real depth once to analyze the different regions.<hr>David said on Tue Jan 15 2002 <br>oh. You have three magi on a team that attempt to knock out the opposing magi with spells, creatures, and relics. Not much different magic in concept but the execution is very different.<hr>Interested Enough said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>Perhaps I'll browse your new section a little more closely, then.  After all, I was close-minded about Lord of the Rings CCG, thinking it would be too limited...but it's one of my favorite games ever because of the insane depth of strategy (it's as deep as Jyhad without all the complications).<br><br>
By the way, you handled my criticism with great class.  Another reason I love Decktech.<hr>neal said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>I like the artwork.  I like it quite a bit actually.  I know all the SW fans hate hand drawn art, but I've yet to ever pick up a SW card due to the picture, whereas I've gotten several magic cards for just that reason (Phyrexian Gremlins, anyone?)<hr>edmund said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>i dunno neal...i think a lot of people started around dagoba because of the executor, but i agree that magic/hand drawn art is cool too.<hr>Dragonbane said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>The best and most original feature of MN is, you have a line-up of three "magi" which provide the energy (like mana) which you use to cast spells and summon creatures.  Your first one fights until he is dead, and then the next one steps in at full power to take up the fight.  This gives MN a very back-and-forth power wave, and goes a long way towards reducing the significance of a good opening draw. You may defeat their first magi quickly, but you should spend most of your energy doing so, and they will start their next turn with a fresh magi.<hr>Michael Pistone said on Wed Jan 16 2002 <br>You all know that Magic is still the most succesful game and they even advertise on this site.  Wizards donated to Freedomcon so I think it's time that you gave Magic it's due and put a section for it on Decktech.<hr>Jim Wong said on Thu Jan 17 2002 <br>Magi-Nation is very popular, it was nominated for InQuests top CCGs of 2001 and is also very fun to play without the hassles of mana or other cards like that.<br>
<br>
I personally think the artwork is some of the best for all the Anime fans and more cartoonish peeps. For those who want to know how it works (very basic):<br>
<br>
You have Magi who can summon creatures, use spells, and play relics with their energy. They have a set amount of energy each turn and special powers (and the same goes for many other cards). At the beginning of each turn, your Magi energizes for a set amount (on the card) and from that, there are certain steps to do and you play cards according to those steps. The energy removal system is simple subtraction (9 energy attacks a 3 energy, 3 energy dies and 9 goes to 6, etc.)<br>
<br>
You have 3 magi, and your job is to defeat all three of your opponents without getting your own defeated in the process. Very fun.<br>
<br>
Also, just because no one plays it in your area doesn't mean no one plays it in your state, I believe there are people in every single state that play MND and are involved with the online community as well.<hr>Sgt_Barich said on Thu Jan 17 2002 <br>i think raw deal would have been a better decision for DT.<hr>David said on Thu Jan 17 2002 <br>If you want Raw Deal on DeckTech email the comish from comicimages.com and let him know!<hr>neal said on Thu Jan 17 2002 <br>I don't see why everyone keeps saying "you should have done this game instead of this game".  what diff does it make, we can do them all.  I think there's some misunderstanding, we will be adding more games, david and I just do them slowly, to get it done right.<br>
<BR><BR><br>
One of the reason Magi Nation jumped to the top (other than it is a very good game) is that the people involved in it are really cool.  They're also sharp as tacks too.  If you all want Raw Deal next, i'd say email the commish and then we write him, he'll be probably suportive of our efforts.<hr>edmund said on Sat Jan 19 2002 <br>is there a way to get into the site and view other decks etc. without submitting anything?<hr>Marysia said on Wed Jan 23 2002 <br>W00t, MND is awesome. (That's why I joined. ^_^o) And Law's deck is the example! *_*o<hr>neal said on Wed Jan 23 2002 <br>I went and read and reviewed law's deck, it was cool.<hr>Bane Slader said on Wed Jan 23 2002 <br>Soon enough the site will open and let me tell you it is a great site.  There will be all kinds of great stuff for you guys to check out.  As a SWCCG player (not retired) this is and will be the next great game.  And no license to get pulled.  When this site open eveyone check out a great site and game.<hr>lakituTELEK said on Thu Jan 24 2002 <br>Hey!  Jwongie's here!  WOOHOO!  Anyways, MND is a very good game.  You shouldn't dismiss it by it's first impression.  And yeah, one of the best things about it is the head peoples (Interactive Imagination) are really cool, and they aren't this big greedy company.  (well maybe but they don't seem like it)  And how you can shape the game by participating in storyline tournaments.<hr>neal said on Thu Jan 24 2002 <br>I have nothing but praise for the guys at Inter Imag.  It's such a difference to deal with them over some other companies, it's just been a real pleasure.  One guy I esp want to name is Ed Bolme there, he's a standup guy.<hr>lakituTELEK said on Thu Jan 24 2002 <br>Interactive Imagination is normally abbreviated as 2i, just in case somebody doesn't know that.<hr>rickert said on Thu Jan 24 2002 <br>I believe MND has just as much strategy as any game out there and more than some. There are no second turn kills like Raw Deal. The people who play the game are also more considerate in both winning and losing than any other game I've been associated with. <br>
Having said that, I believe the next CCG to be treated should be Warhammer 40K - a great game.<hr>Jim Wong said on Fri Jan 25 2002 <br>Wait, I thought this was jsut for MND, not suggestions on the NEXT CCG that Decktech should feature. :P<br>
<br>
Btw, 2i and II are aboth abbreviations for Interactive Imagination, not just 2i.<br>
<br>
(Well, Warhammer 40k is a pretty cool game, I hear a couple of peeps over at II are interested in that as well)<hr>McCool said on Fri Jan 25 2002 <br>Hey TELEK and Jim Wong!<br>
<br>
Yeah Magi-Nation is an awesome game. I have been playing it even before it came out and have been upkeeping a Magi-Nation fansite(II's is probably the only company that supports it's fan sites). I absolutly love the game, I just wish it was a little bit more popular and II wasn't so understaffed(or so it seems).<hr>TELEK said on Fri Jan 25 2002 <br>Well, if it was too big of a company, it would be like Wizards or something, and that wouldn't be much fun now would it?  That's what's cool about 2i, they are different then all of the other companys out there.<hr>cfbnv said on Sun Jan 27 2002 <br>I am thrilled to see MND make it to decktech.  I transferred to MND from Star Wars, and after events like FreedomCon and the DPC tournaments, I am glad to see Decktechs efforts and enthusiasm channeled into one of the greatest games on the market.
