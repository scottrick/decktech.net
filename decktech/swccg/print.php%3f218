<br>
Alan had a problem that I am very disturbed about.  Apparently, one of his star wars ccg decks is now missing.  This deck was in a box, then inside a deck box.  It was a DS lightsaber combat deck, and included many rares like Lord Vader, Lord Maul, Emperor P, and Sidious.<br>
<br>
I am offering a tech point reward for it's safe return.<br>
<br>
5000 for safe return<br>
1000 for reliable information<br>
<br>
Let's be honest.  If you took the deck, please give it back.  Either on purpose or on accident.  It doesn't matter, Alan needs those cards.  Give it back to him, no questions asked.<br>
<br>
We do a lot of stuff for you here on DT, and Alan just finished running a really great DPC.  If this happened to me, I'd be very upset, it's a slap in the face.<br>
<br>
If you have any information about this, also please email Alan.  Someone must have seen something.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows about this, please contact <a href="mailto:alandenny@decktech.net">alandenny@decktech.net</a>.  <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
Neal<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Alan Denny said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>Guys I was really upset about this, and it really is a slap in the face.  Maybe it was totally an accident and if so just drop me a line.  I really need the cards that were taken, because it was my Dark Side Lightsaber Combat deck.  You all know what was in there and it was probably the most expensive deck I have.  Please guys help me get these cards back.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>I see alan already posted.<br>
<br>
Seriously, you all.  if you took them, give 'em back.  On purpose, or on accident, no one will differenciate.  I can even arrange it anonymously if you'd like.<br>
<br>
If you did it, and must remain anonymous, go ahead and create a fake account with a fake name and dmail me.  Or use lotr's traveling names.  Then I can help arrange it.<br>
<br>
I just want alan to get his cards back.<hr>Matt Lush said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>Alright, whoever took it: You better hope nobody narcs your ass out. Cuz if they DO, and you STILL have Alan's cards, I'll personally hunt you down and beat your @ss. If you give up the cards NOW (like Neal said you can do it anonymously), then it won't be a problem. Otherwise you'll have to worry whether whoever else knows you took them is going to sell you out. And if they do, you're dead. After all Alan did to make this DPC a success, I can't believe someone would do that to him.<hr>Brian Wright said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>This is not the first time someone has pulled this crap.  Alan deserves better.  Alan, did you maybe loan your deck to someone?  I don't think so, but I thought I would ask in case it helped you remember when you'd seen it last.  Did you show it to anyone?<hr>Ricky Martinez said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>I cant believe this would happen.  I mean I thought swccg players had more morals than that, thats why we play swccg not magic.  Whoever did take it I ask you to make it right.  . <hr>Quirin Fuergut said on Fri Jul 19 2002 <br>This is really crap, someone stole an Emperor and 2 Lord Vaders from a friend of mine but a whole DS is really bad :-(<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jul 19 2002 <br>Just so you don't feel backed in corner...<br>
<br>
If you did this, listen, just give it back anonymously.  Like i said, no questions asked.  I will even pay for postage to ship it back, no one will ever know.  Just make a fake hotmail account or dmail me.<br>

No one will beat your ass, and i won't tell anyone, i won't even know who you are.<br>
<br>
Seriously, do the right thing and give the cards back!<hr>Alex Deschaine said on Sun Jul 21 2002 <br>There are many things I like about CCGs, but the one thing I most like about SW:CCG was the sportsmanship  and fun atmosphere it gave me. Now someone does something like this.... it ruins the gaming experience for everybody, and it also sets a bad rep for whoever took the cards. Alan took the time to collect and make this deck, and someone stole the cards form him. Thats disqusting. Whoever has it, just give it back ASAP. If you do keep it, it will be on your concience for the rest of your life. (Corny, I know, but it IS true.) Just give it back. Theres no reason whoever took it should have, unless he or she cant make a half decent deck by him or herself.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Mon Jul 22 2002 <br>give the deck back man. this is stupidess thing a person can do. i am sorry for ur lost alan. where did u lose it at? maybe some one left there decks their. <hr>Pat Ziagos said on Tue Jul 23 2002 <br>dude, dont be a baby, just deal with ur loss. <hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jul 23 2002 <br>Gagliardi, we know it's you imitating Ziagos.  You are gonna pay, you little ugly ass punk<hr>Kenneth Bradford said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>This sort of crap really sucks.  I went to a tourney in Memphis long ago to play in a Magic tourney and had a Chaos Orb deck swiped during some trading.  My own fault?  A little, but leeches have to take some blame.  It was part of the final reasons I decided to quit Magic.  I recommend whoever took the cards give them back, but I doubt it's going to happen.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>I seriously doubt the cards will come back and if they don't I will gladly donate some cards to Alan.<br>
<br>
I have some of those cards collecting dust so let me know what you need exactly.<hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>Mike,<br>
<br>
Thanks to you and everyone else on here for the support.  No I have not found anyone elses cards.  Some one had to go into another box inside my gaming box to steal the cards.  I appriciate the offer Mike but unless you have a few Sidious', Emp Palpatines, Lord Vader's, and Lord Mauls lyeing around ... of course of all the decks they could have taken it ws my DS Lightsaber Combat Deck.  The person who took it will get theirs.  This is not the first time it has happened to me, probably won't be the last.<hr>David Jones said on Wed Jul 24 2002 <br>Well I'll check with the others from out here in Colorado, The other three did all won the Team thing where they each got a Lord Maul and I think I have some Extra Sidious' Not sure on the Palpy's or the Vaders.<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Sat Jul 27 2002 <br>hey guys ... i know like a while ago at my first ever SWCCG tournement my cards got stolen . I told that to my assurance on insurance i dunno the proper term. And like it was cover under my house even though it was stolen in a shop. And they gave me like 700 $<br>
<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Jul 27 2002 <br>Dom, that is huge!  I would never have thought of that, that is a stroke of genius.  I will mail alan now.<hr>chris carney said on Wed Aug 7 2002 <br>Alan i check the tapes from the store on that day but unfortunately the camera didnt have that great or too clear of a view. if you need any extra cards ill hook you up with what i got.<hr>Brian Wright said on Tue Aug 13 2002 <br>Alan, I know my collection is not that impressive, but anything you need to replace your deck that I have I will gladly donate.  Send me a decklist at Bean2213@aol.com and I will let you know what I have.
