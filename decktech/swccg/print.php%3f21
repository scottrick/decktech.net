Should be fun<hr>eric george said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>I'm there, what's the entry fee?<hr>Serpent said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>That's awesome... I'd figured since no more DPC's had been announced, that no more would be announced (espescially considering the lack of updates to the DPC page).<br>
<br>
Now, if only they can be announced MORE than five weeks in advance... :P<hr>Charles H. said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>We the players need more than 5 weeks notice.  This is absurd, and you should have these planned out at a more advanced time.  Also, these DPC are coinciding with the major Summer Con schedule.  ALSO, August 8th is a wednesday?  C'mon People, pull your head out of that deap dark space.<hr>A #&!%ing tard said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>That's the 18th..<hr>Phrim said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>Ugh...  If it were a couple of weeks later I could've made it...<hr>-Avatar- said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>Wicked, maybe I won't be DQ'd this time round.... Any big name Americans joining us in Montreal?<hr>ball said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>could they possibly change it to the last week of august???<hr>Wedge231 said on Wed Jul 11 2001 <br>Maybe I could go, yay!<hr>Rei said on Thu Jul 12 2001 <br>Great, big tourney coming to town! ^.^<hr>Andrew Liu said on Thu Jul 12 2001 <br>I THINK you can put this address in mapquest for driving directions...<br>

<hr>Garion said on Sun Jul 15 2001 <br>WE WANT DPC´S IN ITHOR<hr>Jank said on Mon Jul 16 2001 <br>DPC Quebec is gonna be a flop.  Noone plays up there cept 5 people and noone wants to travel there.<hr>Burnt toast said on Mon Jul 16 2001 <br>I think you need some info. The distance between montreal and let say ramapo is 5h a lot of players live in between that or not far (twigg, sokol, ghetto squad and more). Second considering what distance people put in to go to Normal i think people will come to montreal not just for the tournament but for the city it self. Montreal is good place to have fun and you dont need to worrie about langage barrier since most people are billingual.  <hr>Greg said on Wed Jul 18 2001 <br>booya, I can take the city bus to the tournament.<hr>Serpent said on Wed Jul 18 2001 <br>yeah montreal is awesome.... :P<hr>Jek Nkik said on Wed Jul 18 2001 <br>Sweet! now since Quebec is a walled city those of us from MI plan to lay siege! who's with us?<hr>Crusher said on Thu Jul 19 2001 <br>The DPC will be in Montréal. not Québec city<hr>raven said on Thu Aug 2 2001 <br>HEY ALASKA HAD THE MOST PLAYERS COME TO THEIR STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS PER CAPITA! WHY DON'T WE GIT A DPC OR ANYTHING!?!?!?!? <hr>Garion said on Fri Aug 3 2001 <br>WE WANT DPC IN ITHOR (AND EUROPE).<hr>Andy P said on Sun Aug 5 2001 <br>YA DPC SHALL COME TO EUROPE ASWELL! WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR IT?<hr>Deck said on Sat Aug 11 2001 <br>What time are these events starting???<hr>COTEB said on Sun Aug 12 2001 <br>The Warm up starts at 5pm and the DPC starts at 10am<hr>Phobos said on Mon Aug 13 2001 <br>Deck wins.
