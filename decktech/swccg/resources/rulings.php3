                            <p align='justify'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, here's a ruling from Juz - force lightning can't be used to fry Frozen Han.  Because you all were dying to try it, right?  A lot of old questions have been lost - I'll be staying on top of the question list weekly now that I'm playing full time again.<p>

<p><b>On to the Questions. </b><p>


<p><b> Josk Gatrez </b> asked:<br>
<i> If I'm Using S-foils on my B-wing attack Squadron that has Proton Torpedoes on it, is its weapon destiny+3 from S-foils? or +1?
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Only one of the B-Wings in the squadron actually fires the Torpedoes so the bonus is +1.  If you had 3 torpedoes on the same squadron, each B Wing could fire, and each would be +1 to the destiny because of S-Foils.

<p><b> JediMandalor </b> asked:<br>
<i> Can the Mellineum Falcon be replaced by Gold Squadren 1 (eg. like personas)?    </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Persona replacement only applies to characters  no replacing starships.


<p><b> Jeremy </b> asked:<br>
<i> Does Noble Sacrifice count as being "lost from table" for purposes of Anakin Skywalker?	</i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Id say no  about to be lost is different from about to be placed out of play, and Luke the requirement that Luke is being lost from table means he should be heading to the lost pile.

<p><b> i like jawas </b> asked:<br>
<i> what does it mean when the CC obj. says your drains may not be modified if you have a imperial there. does that mean test one doesn't effect that site?
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   This is probably the single most common question  modifying a drain means applying a + or  directly to the drain  Test-1 and Menace Fades modifies the modifiers by allowing you to ignore or cancel them.	Its different.	Test-1 works vs Pray I Dont Alter It Any Further.

<p><b> Lanigan </b> asked:<br>
<i> Ok do the named troopers like sergeant junkin still count as troopers?    </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Most of the named troopers do count, and theyre annotated in the CRD.  Junkin isnt mentioned  Id say no..


<p><b> The Fryx </b> asked:<br>
<i> How many cards can you retrieve with Seinar Fleet Systems when you deploy Emperor's Sword/Shield? I've heard many people say 3, but on SFS it says something like: 'retrieve one force each TIME you deploy a TIE'. The most logical thing would be 1 force total since you deploy them all at the same TIME. Otherwise it should have read 'retrieve 1 force for each TIE you just deployed'.
?   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   You retrieve when you DEPLOY a squadron (as opposed to replacing with a TIE Assault Sqaudron), and since you deployed three TIES, you retreive 3.

<p><b> darth mudd </b> asked:<br>
<i> if i draw two power droids for battle destiny, do i double my power and then double it again?
?   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Hmmm is this a trick question?  The card says once per battle.  Oh yeah, theyre not cumulative, either.  No, you dont quadruple your power.

<p><b> CorellianPL </b> asked:<br>
<i> I just got ISB Operations and I was wondering if I could use prob droids since it says characters I was not sure if I could use them case they are droids
?   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Ah yes, Probe Droids most definitely work for ISB.	Droids are a type of character.  Moreover, Empires Sinister Agents would be pretty dumb with a big ole Probe Droid picture if you couldnt use them as agents

<p><b> Matt McClain </b> asked:<br>
<i> Can scouts move as a react?  </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Nope.  Heres what scouts do NOTHING.  However, lots of ancillary cards are enhanced by the scout characteristic.  And the all important form a search party function.


<p><b> Tom "Bomar" Ercanbrack </b> asked:<br>
<i> ok I am playing "There is good in him" the he is play "hunt down". "Luke" is in chirpas hut, he drops "vader" and moves to the hut then he plays "vaders obsession" to start a epic dule. The 1st question is can he start a epic dule or dose luke get captured first? I think he cannot because its not a just action and luke being captured seemes to like it is. I say that beacuse I think if he were to play a non epic dule "vader obsession" by moving to lukes site then play Vader obsesions then he can sart a dule that way. Because it is a just action. As far as I uderstand just actions it would take place before the capture text on "TIGIH". So thats my 2nd question. Can vader sart a duel that way as in a non epic duel. Also can Vader non epic duel Luke while he is in a speeder. What it comes down to is can vader epic/non epic dule Luke if he s captured. And when dose the capture text on "TIGIH" take place.
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Youre on the right track but you got the wrong solution  Vader capturing Luke is an automatic action  there is no opportunity to play a just action before the automatic action kicks in.  Youll never duel Luke if theyre playing TIGIH.  Since Obsession (epic or non-epic) does not target captives, you cant duel Luke once hes been forked over.

<p><b> Eclypse </b> asked:<br>
<i> John, Fall of The Empire allows you to relocate a character from one site to an adjacent site after a light side character of ability >3 just won a battle. How does this work with the Emperor's "Never moves to a location where light has presence" game text, if he is relocated to a location where light has presence? Is the card cancelled, or does the relocation occur? Also, if an escort is nailed with this on Cloud City, and the Weather Vane is on the table, does that release the captive being escorted if the escort is sent to the Weather Vane? Thanx for your time.
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Thats a good question.  In the past, it seemed that relocation wasnt a form of movement, but now its considered an unlimited move.	Id say the Emperor couldnt be relocated to a site with presence.  The interrupt doesnt say something like or the character is lost so the Emperor would stay put if there were no other choices.  Since characters on the weather vane become on table for uniqueness only Id say the current releasing captives rules would let the captive escape if an escort was relocated to the weather vane.

<p><b> Mark McNiff </b> asked:<br>
<i> On the DS card "Leave Them To Me" it says "While you occupy a Subjugated planet location,......and your Force drains my not be reduced......." Does that mean that this card would counter act Jedi test #1, System Will Slip Through Your Fingers, Contol, and Projection of a Skywalker, or just Projection?
  </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Your force drain may not be reduced  that would just affect Projection (a force drain modifier)  the other cards are either canceling the drain completely or canceling the bonuses.


<p><b> JABBAFETT </b> asked:<br>
<i> what characters does Squadron assignments work on with Tydirium?
  </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   General Solo counts, because his gametext mentions Tydirium.

<p><b> DoomHawq </b> asked:<br>
<i> Can a landed starfighter at a docking bay in any way Docking Bay Transit?	 </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Um, no.


<p><b> C. Westergard </b> asked:<br>
<i> On the LS Effect Weapons Display starships with 2 weapons are +2 power. If using B-wings and after firing intruder missles and returning missles to used pile are the B-wings still +2 power?   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   No, the B Wing wouldnt get the power +2.  By the time the power segment comes around, the missile is already in the used pile (if you fired it) and it no longer has 2 weapons deployed on it.


<p><b> John Bowles </b> asked:<br>
<i> Does Dejarik Hologameboard count as a battleground?
  </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   No	check out the new battleground definitions in the CRD.

<p><b> bob a fett </b> asked:<br>
<i> if you are playing the ds2 ls objective and you turn vader with anikan skywalker is the game over? im pretty sure its not but i would like clarification. thanx </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   No, the Objective has the game text for Vader turning to the light side and depleting darks life force, not the interrupt.

<p><b> Dark_Jedi </b> asked:<br>
<i> When can i use Trample to target a ls character? Is it only during my battle phase, or can i use it anytime, like a normal interrupt? Thanks.
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Anytime.  Trample is cool.

<p><b> Jim </b> asked:<br>
<i> The TIE Defender and Sentinel-Class Landing craft both read "Any starship cannon may deploy aboard" does this mean I can deploy an ion cannon?	</i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Id say yes	the specific game text on the starfighters would override the ion cannons gametext.  The Nebulon B Frigate clarification only applied to that ship; other weapons can cross the capital / starfighter




<p><b> Ankoor Biswas </b> asked:<br>
<i> Hey, I was wondering about a certain little trick I like to play in my RalOps deck. If I put a Sandwhirl at the Desert (and it can't move since it's not at Tatooine), does it stay effective FOREVER or is it lost since it can't move? In the former case, it could be an easy way to control a generic site. . .thanks a lot, I appreciate it.
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Yep, thats how it works  the sandwhirl stays on that location for the rest of the game (at least until it is Controlled).  Many light side mains have been lost in the sandwhirl

<p><b> DJ "Han" McEntee </b> asked:<br>
<i>Can you use S-Foils on squadrons? Say I deployed a B-wing Squadron, would it be power 18 because of S-Foils, since there are 3 fighters, 14 because it is only one card, or 12, because it is not effected? Thanks for reading this	</i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Yes.  Squadrons count as multiples of the starfighter card they contain, so the S-Foils would add +6 to a B-Wing or X-Wing squadron.
.


<p><b> JediStv </b> asked:<br>
<i>1. Persona Replacement: Can Boushh replace another Lei? A friend told me she cannot because she only deploys as an undercover spy and the Lei I was changing her with was not an undercover spy. I don't think this can be right. 2. If I have a Starship with Landing Claw on it at Tattoine System without any other starships there (besides opponents) can Tattoine Occupation still be canceled? Thanks for your time! </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   You can persona replace an undercover character.  If  you persona replace Bousssh, cover would be broken.  Landing Clawed starships do not provide presence or occupy a location if they are attached.  You need to control the system to cancel Occupations (ie, you have ships providing presence on your side of the force, and opponent has no ships providing presence on their side of the force).

<p><b> DJ "Han" McEntee </b> asked:<br>
<i> Ok. Say Chewbacca of Kashyyyk is at a site with an Ewok Catapult and some other Ewok scrub. The opponent grabs Wuta and Lumat, and I use my two Imperial Barriers on them. He starts a battle and targets my Tempest Scout 1. He draws a 2. The card says add 1 to total for each Ewok present. Does that mean present at the battle, or present at the site. He says it adds 3 to the total. Thanks for you time. </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Heres my reading of the catapult  if you are firing it during a battle, the Ewok doing the targeting must be participating or the catapult cant be fired at all.  However, any other Ewoks at the site that are excluded from participating would still be present at the site and would add to the total.

<p><b> DJ "Han" McEntee </b> asked:<br>
<i> Do characters on an entrenchment or bargaining table count as "on table" for the purposes of rebel reinforcement??   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Nope  they only count as being on the table for checking uniqueness dots.


<p><b> Wedgea </b> asked:<br>
<i> The LS has 4 Rebel Troopers all armed with Mos Eisily Blasters in battle at the Dune Sea against 4 Stormtroopers. The LS makes all 4 stormtroopers forfiet 0 because of the forfeit -2. The LS draws battle destiny of 1. Does this mean that the DS has to forfiet all Stormtroopers to attrition, even though they are all forfeit 0? ?	</i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Yes, all the stormtroopers are lost.  Each time a stormtrooper is forfeited, the question is asked:  Are there still cards at the site that need to be forfeited to satisfy the remaining attrition?  Since the answer is yes, the next stormtrooper is forfeited too.

<p><b> Wedgea </b> asked:<br>
<i> If the LS moved a character from Home One: Docking Bay to Endor: Landing Platform (DS version), would it cost them 9 Force (9 + 0) or would it be free because Home One : Docking Bay says its free??   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Free is an unmodifiable value (you cant add anything to it).  Compare that to the Dark Side DS-2 docking bay which adds to the transit cost by saying ignore the other docking bays gametext.

<p><b> David Wilde </b> asked:<br>
<i> I have seen a deck from this server. It was a EBO-deck with "Heading for the medical frigate". He started with "A new secret base", "Squadron assignment" and "Do or do not"... ...Now Im wondering if this is a correct start? On "Heading for the Medical Frigate" it says "deploy on table". But on "A new secret base" it says "deploy on 1st marker"...    </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   The effects deployed by the new starting interrupts must deploy on table.  Immune to alter effects like ANSB or Security Precautions are not valid.

<p><b> Otto Kissenger </b> asked:<br>
<i> My question is about the Objective "This deal is getting worse..." On the back side of it, it says "where ever you have an imperial, your force drains cannot be modified" Now does that mean Menace fades, Jedi test # 1, and control will not work on affecting my drains? Or since menace fades says, all force drains bonuses are "canceled" is that different? I just need someone to clear this up for me.   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Modifying a drain happens when someone applys a positive or negative number directly to your drain (ex:  Local Uprisings 1 to drains, or Projection of a Skywalker).  However, Test-1 and Menace Fades are cancelling or ignoring your modifiers to the drain, not applying their own modifier to the drain.  Its different.  (Jedi Test 1/Menace Fades still cancel the bonuses from Dark Deal even when TDIGWATT is flipped).

<p><b> Dave "JediJawa" Lankton </b> asked:<br>
<i> Can a Dark Side player choose, when facing up against the new LS Objective, There Is Good In Him, to let Luke "escape" to the LS used pile when he is captured? From what I read in the glossary, the DS player has the choice to seize, imprision, or let any captured character escape. What if Luke is captured through another method, i.e. Oota Goota, Solo? Also, DS is playing Hunt Down, LS playing TIGIH/ICSH. Vader captures Luke. DS pays four force to return Vader to hand. What happens to Luke?
   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:   Juz offered a ruling to the listserv regarding TIGIH  attempts to capture Luke using the Objective must be seizures, and Luke does not escape if thats not possible (ex:  if the only imperial at Lukes site is aboard a vehicle with no passenger capacity).  When Lukes escort leaves the table, he would return to the light side of the force (if possible).  Working through your examples:  Oota Goota, you could make Luke escape to the used pile if there were no imperial escorts.  Hunt Down picks up Vader:  Luke would return to the light side of the location.

<p><b> ATG Questions </b> asked:<br>
<i> If I am playing an objective, can I still use a starting interrupt? a) What if my objective uses the Audience Chamber, and LS also uses the Audience Chamber, is my objective placed out of play? What all can I pull with "Any Means Necessary"? I vaguely recall an example article on Decipher but can no longer find it. a) Boba Fett, Boba Fett with Blaster Rifle, Boba Fett in Slave I, and a dungeon ? I play Sniper with "All Wrapped Up" and a character weapon that captures instead of hits. Can I: a) use the sniper to capture targets as per the weapon's game text? b) if I use a weapon that 'hits' the target; light saber, Dengar's Blaster Carbine, etc; can I use "All Wrapped Up" to capture them, or do I still need "We have a prisoner"?   </i>
<p><u>Answer</u>:  Yes, you can use a starting interrupt with an Objective (except Combat Readiness / Careful Planning).  With Any Means Necessary, you can pull a character, weapon, starship plus the prison	it checks to see if the card is the right type, not what else is containted in the card  so you could grab Boba Fett in Slave One, Boba Fett with Blaster Rifle, and Boba Fetts Blaster Rifle.	As for the Sniper question, capture weapons would have their normal effect.  All Wrapped Up is only going to work when a character is forfeited (ie, during a battle).	We Have a Prisoner will work with Sniper.
