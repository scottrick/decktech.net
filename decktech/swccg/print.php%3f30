Special Guest Player - Justin Pakes!! Plan to stay over for the Decipher Open Events on Saturday.  <hr><b>comments</b><hr>Lateral said on Tue Aug 14 2001 <br>OK, since damn near every city is getting a DPC, what's this I heard about DPC Raleigh/Durham?  I heard something mentioned briefly at a local here (NC), anyone have any inside info?<hr>David Jones said on Tue Aug 14 2001 <br>Just don't forget about the Big DPC in Denver on the 1st...that would be an interesting week though go to denver then to phoenix then return to your home.<hr>brad said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br><b>I WANT ANOTHER DPC NORMAL<hr>DeckTecher said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>What the hell? This will be the third DPC in the Tatooine region. Yet there have been none in plenty of other regions where the player base is either larger, equally as large, or close to it. Like Coruscant, Dantooine, Alderaan, Yavin IV, Endor, etc. This is just silly.<hr>DeckTecher said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>Ack, Kashyyyk, not Coruscant (RamapoCon).<hr>Girard said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>remember the time that Worlds was on the East coast and nothing on the west coast (except for San Diego ComiCon)...yea I remember that time<hr>Garrison said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>why dont you jabronis on the East coast shut the hell up?  If you guys had anyone compitent enough to organize a DPC, then I guess that you all would have one.  get your acts together and set one up.  damn, you guys need to stop bitching so damn much.<hr>Lateral said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>Excuse me?  I don't see YOUR sorry ass doing anything to set up a DPC.  Just so you know, NC has plenty of people capable of setting up a big tourney.  We have had heard there were talks of a DPC TrinocCon, I was just wondering if there's anything the DT people know that others don't.  Instead, I get a bitch-whine from another DTer.  Get a life jackass.<hr>IG-99 pheonix player said on Thu Aug 16 2001 <br>woohoo<hr>Towner said on Thu Aug 16 2001 <br>I think it just great when people can try to one-up each other like 6 year old children. For a long time the east coast has had the share of big events, now it is the west coast turn. If will have the patience to wait I'm sure the east coast will have an explosion of DPCs<br>
