<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>The DPC Expands Tournament Formats posted by DeckTech on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>The DPC introduces the Master Series, a new series of tournaments designed to expand the frequency and number of DPC events giving more players the opportunity to play competitively. The current DPC tournaments, called DPC Opens, are officially renamed the DPC Championship Series and will continue in conjunction with the new Master Series events. <br>
<br>
The DPC Master Series<br>
<br>
These events are identical to the DPC Championship Series tournaments except that instead of having guaranteed cash payouts of $1,500 the prizes vary directly based on the number of participants. At a minimum the payout will equal 85% of the entry fees. For example, 70 players at $25 each would yield a cash payout of about $1,490. The remaining 15% would go to pay for the venue cost and the DPC Coordinators related expenses. <br>
<br>
Also at Master series events 1st place receives 60% of the total prize, 2nd 20%, 3rd and 4th each get 10%. In our example above this would translate into $894 for first, $298 for second, and $149 for third and forth. Compared to our Championship Series the Master Series events will distribute more of the prize money to 2nd place.<br>
<br>
By making these changes in the payout structure the DPC Master Series tournaments can scale to meet the size of the Coordinators vision. Under the new format more people will be qualified to hold DPC events expanding the number and frequency of these high quality CCG tournaments. <br>

I've attempted to generate support and find organisers for something like this but while there are plenty of people interested, no-one wants to actually take the reins and hold one. I'll discuss this with the crew on our trip to the continental in paris. I'd certainly help run such an event but direct organisation is obviously not viable because of my location up here (by necessity, it'd have to be a southern venue). If you want to see a DPC London, get moving and make one happen!<hr>Unga Bunga said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>How about a DPC Sumatra?<hr>haakon said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>phuck uz all, i say DPC Antarctica will be the PREMIER event of the year. mebbe the esteemed CEO can club some baby seals to cover the costs...at least the venue will be cheap.<hr>norite said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>I guess this means good news for most of you, but it means nothing for me..  :(  There will never be a DPC tournament within 6 hours drive of where I live.  6 hours really is not that bad, but the getting home part sucks..<hr>217 said on Sat Aug 11 2001 <br>Gotta get a DPC in San Bernadino..It's only the largest County in the World so why the heck not.<hr>brad said on Sat Aug 11 2001 <br>I <b>NEED another dpc normal!!!<hr>brad said on Sat Aug 11 2001 <br>No, I'm <b>NOT<a>kidding, I need another DPC normal<hr>Eldorian said on Sat Aug 11 2001 <br>dpc in germany!...<hr>Garion said on Sun Aug 12 2001 <br>Yes, I´m with Eldorian. DPCs in EUROPE!.<hr>Jason said on Mon Aug 13 2001 <br>How about a dpc huntsville??? We always get at least 20 or so with locals. Plus down in huntsville we got a lot of good players out here.<hr>Kohman said on Mon Aug 13 2001 <br>These make a lot more sense.  That way you can't really lose a lot of money on DPC's.  Hold one of these in MPLS... I can guarantee a pretty damn good showing.  After all, 5 of the 30 day 2 players of Gen Con were FROM mn.<hr>Jawa Tosser said on Mon Aug 13 2001 <br>I am looking to hold a DPC in SLC  UT sometime this year.  How much advance notice would be needed?  Is mid_september too early?  How about mid-October?  Email me your ideas.<hr>Josh said on Tue Aug 14 2001 <br>will there be more in florida.<hr>frenchie6901 said on Wed Aug 15 2001 <br>when is DPC Seattle??!?!
