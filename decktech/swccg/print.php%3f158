EVENT: September 2002 <p><small>edited by DeckTech on Thu Apr 18 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Matt Lush said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>Damn...my regional only an hour away? That just doesn't seem right. I'm used to driving 3 hours, or 6, or 10...<hr>Fernando Medalón said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>A little bit latter for us in Ithor ;)<hr>Simon Lee said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>So basically us in Calgary are screwed out of our regional cuz there's no way any of us will make a ten hour drive (each way) to play in a Sunday regional.  Especially with DPC Vegas the week before.  A regional could have easily been scheduled for ANY Saturday through July but instead, they seem to have chosen to alienate all out of province players.  Well done.<hr>Alan Sagan said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>yah that sucks... I thought it was on a saturday.  You COULD do the bus trip.. I did that for two of the regionals when they were in calgary, bus the whole night before, get into calgary at 5AM, play in the regional all day.. bus back that night.<br>
  Or Fly it, it shouldn't be expensive to fly from calgary to van (or van to calgary.. bus one way, fly the other, i did that before too).<br><br>
Well, you've got some options... but the options suck.<hr>Darryll Silva said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>I need a head count for the alderran regionals...maybe for food and such email me to tell me if u going<hr>John Arendt said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>For the Calgary guys:<br><br>
Guess you can just hang out and watch the Avs sweep through the Stanley Cup play-offs again, since the Flames are out... :)<br>
Ouch.  Sorry for being obnoxious.<br>Seriously, though, the regionals were set up by local volunteers, I apologize for it being so far away and on a Sunday.  If you've got a good player base in the Calgary area, I'd consider holding a mini-Open near there, perhaps at a gaming convention over the summer.  That will give local players a chance to qualify.  I've tried to be generous with scheduling the mini-Opens and support out of the way places.  You can drop me a line at littlejohn@attbi.com.<br>I saw a similar complaint about Yavin-4 - its my understanding that Jim Colson would run a mini-Open at a Con in Northern Alabama or Nashville because the regional was pretty far away.<hr>Ciaron Cunningham said on Thu Apr 18 2002 <br>I'm all for the mini-open idea, we've had a regional in Calgary for as long as I can remember. And if I dont make it to the regional I'll sit back and watch Detroit school everyone!<hr>edmund gray said on Fri Apr 19 2002 <br>so because you've been lucky enough to have a regional in your area forever, you're going to bitch when it's closer to other people for once? Why don't we just move Dcon there too?<hr>Ciaron Cunningham said on Fri Apr 19 2002 <br>I see no problem with that... =)<hr>Andrew Howard said on Fri Apr 19 2002 <br>Basically we had to make decisions(ok John had to :)) based on a number of factors, biggest one was people volunteering to run the thing. If no one in your area volunteered, you can't complain about there not being a regional, we aren't gonna drive to Canada to run it for you :)<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Fri Apr 19 2002 <br>wow alderan is up first.. cool this works.<hr>Seth Van Winkle said on Fri Apr 19 2002 <br>Damn, I'm in Europe during my regional.  Not like I would have done better than 3-3, but it would have been fun to see some of my Minnesota friends.<hr>Erich Hawbaker said on Sat Apr 20 2002 <br>On the eve of May 3rd a humble farmboy will look at the sunset and know that tomorrow his conquest begins...<hr>Alan Sagan said on Mon Apr 22 2002 <br>Hey for any Alberts players.... That weekend is the long weekend, so monday shouldn't be a problem.  <hr>Carson Bell said on Mon Apr 22 2002 <br>I am in the same boat as all the Calgary people with me being from Edmonton.  It would be sweet if there was a mini con somewhere in Alberta that would be sweet.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Apr 23 2002 <br>Just a reminder, we have had some questions on this, Regionals are only for players residing in that particular region, they are not open events. I know I will be checking DL's at mine :) haha<hr>Carlos Bernia said on Thu Apr 25 2002 <br>In Ithor, we have a champion... JUANFRA BUHEDO, from Madrid, but a champion without any arward, any t-shirt and only a card (DM foil) for 10 $/head.<br>
What's happends with this game?<hr>Michael Hawley said on Mon Apr 29 2002 <br>Kashyyyk Regional Champ is Steve Brentson with Justin Desai finishing 2nd. <hr>Reggie Martin said on Sun May 5 2002 <br>The "Mini-Open" for NYC at Neutral Ground is supposedly on June 8th, or at least that is what they had on their calendar.
