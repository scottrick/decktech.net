<br>
I don't ask for many favors from you all, but <b>everyone do me a favor and read this</b>, and if you are at Origins, I don't care what game you are there to play, continue the favor and go hang with 2i and give them a big DeckTech hello.  <br>
<br>
<b>Jimmer, Jenifer Hunter</b> and the rest of 2i staff are really great people and have a really awesome game.  It's been built from the ground up in an underground fashion, just like DeckTech was, and they've been really successful mainly due to the efforts of their staff, not big name licenses or huge budgets.<br>
<br>
So do me a favor and go check out the game, and meet the people that are into it.  Plus, remember, Jenifer Hunter is slated to be <b>DT Calendar girl for September</b>!  MND has become a huge part of DeckTech and I for one am really glad to have such an outstanding game around.<br>
<br>
Go greet them, and that's an order! ;-)<br>
<br>
Here's the announcement and schedule, it's got all kinds of creative formats.  Creativity, that is a welcome change to tcg's.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Most of the Interactive Imagination staff will be at Origins this year -<br>
come visit us at the event booth in the main showroom, or in the tournament<br>
area. If you have League, Tournament or Grand Magi Council questions, we<br>
will be back in the office on July 8th and 9th.<br>
<br>
More complete details regarding Origins can be found on our website.<br>

<br>
In the "Mixed Doubles" format, beginning players are paired up with<br>
experienced players to take on other teams throughout the tournament. This<br>
is a great way to learn the game, and to introduce friends to Magi-Nation.<br>
<br>
The Great Relic Robbery is a special one-shot Storyline tournament, where<br>
Cald strikes out to retrieve one of their most precious Relics, the Scroll<br>
of Fire. The tournament primarily focuses on a contest between Cald and<br>
Orothe, but there is something to be gained for those who are playing for<br>
their own favorite region! For the story background, check out...<br>

<br>
League For a Day is going to be great for casual play! Bring in a variety of<br>
decks, or just play your favorite in this relaxed, fun environment. There<br>
are lots of great prizes to be given away. Jenifer Hunter, our league<br>
coordinator, will be the special guest host.<br>
<br>
The Invitational tournament looks like a normal constructed deck tournament,<br>
but we are including some cool prizes - special promos, byes into the World<br>
Championship, and more!<br>

<br>
Yeah, that's right, faramir, alex tennet, kim caton, matt lush, all you regulars here, i'm expecting you to go at least say hello!<hr>Doug Taylor said on Sat Jun 29 2002 <br>Hey yea!  What Neal said...<br>
<br>
I will personally attest to the fact that Jimmer is one of the NICEST guys I've ever met in the CCG world.  Stop by and at least say hello to them!<hr>Ken Cross said on Sat Jun 29 2002 <br>I can do that if you fill me in on what 2i is.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Jun 30 2002 <br>Definitely, the game looks really cool and seems to be one of the best new games out there. BTW, 2i = company that makes MND.<hr>Adam Drake said on Mon Jul 1 2002 <br>I wish I was going to origins... Seriously, the people who put on MND tournaments are really great folks. I know the ones at DPC Atlanta went out of there way to be accomodating, even in the face of rude miniatures gamers. <br>
<br>
Hey Neal, when do you think you will make my "big announcement?"<br>
<hr>Richard Riley said on Mon Jul 1 2002 <br>2i = Interactive Imagination. They will be at booth 610 (see floorplan at http://www.originsgames.com/pdfs/ExhFloorPlan.pdf).  I'll probably be demoing at the booth on Thursday and Sunday, and helping Jenifer with League for a Day on Saturday. Of course, on Friday, I'll be busy winning the tournament. :)<br>

Redeemer of Ogar<hr>Jim Wong said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>For such a small company in comparison to huge companies like WotC, II (or 2i) has done marvelously well and is a great bunch of people combined together to help make a pretty darn good CCG. See more about the game at Insiider.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Insiider is a cool site, really great artwork actually
