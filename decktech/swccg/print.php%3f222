And props to Munchkin for making the calendar look great for the 2nd month in a row.<hr>Ken Cross said on Tue Jul 30 2002 <br>I guess I'll be the one to point out the only cloud in the sky, but I've noticed that the dates skip from 17 to 22.<hr>Enrique Huerta said on Tue Jul 30 2002 <br>It has a calendar?

<br>
thanx for the report though.<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Jul 30 2002 <br>I must admit i was rather skeptical of this whole calander thing at first, but it's turned into probably the coolest DT project ever, nice job guys and gals.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>You were looking at the dates?  Laugh :).  I dunno, you might as well fix it, helps to keep up the charade that we actually care that it's a calendar :).<hr>John Irving said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>What a hotty :D<hr>Chris Cicconi said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Fixing the date at least makes it look like we're trying to be professional and looking at the dates....whethere we are or not :-p<hr>will gilchrist said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Great job Neal.  Munchkin you look great and the whole calendar looks pretty well put together, save the whole missing a few days thing....  But who cares about the dates anyway?<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Yeah! I'm no dog! You hear that Sean? He said I look great! hehe =^_^=<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>muchos improvement on the layout, neal...keep it up! well done, looks good...<br>
<br>

<br>
Got to give the credit to the main man <b>David "the founder" Akers</b> for the layout.  He took my design and made it 100X better.  He is a truly talented graphic artist.<hr>Lyle Waldman said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Munchkin is quite a QT...Whoever said she was probably ugly in the last article is an idiot.  I only wish there were more gamer gurlz like her...on the other hand, I wish there were more gamer gurlz in general... =(<hr>Ghery Pettit said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Cute, but too young.  :)<hr>Marc Urrutia said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Nice calendar.  Good job Neal.  Great pictures Munchkin.  You are easy on the eyes!<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>Even if there were a million more girl gamers, THERE'S ONLY ONE MUNCHKIN BEEYA! =^_^=<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>oh munchkin i am sorry, i just hit your eye<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>*smack* WATCH WHERE YOU'RE POINTING THAT THING!<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Aug 4 2002 <br>Can someone from NJ beat gagliardi's ass for me?
