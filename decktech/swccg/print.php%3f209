<br>
Alanta news.<br>
<br>
DeckTech Event Co-ord extraordinaire Adam Drake continues his test of the DPC Locals with another hundred dollar cash prize tournament in Atlanta.  Adam has actually *expanded* the format at the outstanding, gamer friendly <b>TNT Toys</b> by adding in both Magic and Star Wars CCG!  <br>
<br>
Before I dive into the schedule, I just want to compare DPC with other tournament formats<br>
<br>
<b>Entry</b><br>
<br>
DPC Local $10<br>
<br>
Others $15<br>
<br>
<b>Prizes</b><br>
<br>
DPC Local $100 to first, cash to rest of top 4<br>
<br>
Others - Winners get packs of Mines of Moria<br>
<br>
<b>Retailer</b><br>
<br>
DPC Local - Free to retailer<br>
<br>
Others - Charge local retailer $300<br>
<br>
As you can see, there really is no comparison, that is why DPC is and will continue to be the Number One Event program <br>
<br>
So on to the schedule for that weekend.<br>

The second is the computer games. it may cost penny money but nothing more then that its awsome. Some of the people are cool well most andy little bro is an ass but good as hell at swccg.<hr>Andrew kcobal said on Tue Jul 2 2002 <br>u need to add swccg wtf is that man lotr but no swccg.

Adam- is there any chance of getting CCG in? I know of several people are really pumped. Hell, I'll run it if you can't get anyone else. Whatever. <hr>Adam Drake said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>unless you can get me 10 players, I cannot guarantee the $100 prize. If you want me to do a tournament, I might be able to find a TD, but ot would be a 6pm start. with 4 games, no guaranteed prizes. email me at adamdrake@decktech.net with people you think would be interested, and I will see what I can do...<hr>Brian Hunter said on Wed Jul 3 2002 <br>hehe, cool.  I will definitely "start looking for dpc locals with enterprising event co-ordinators near me soon".  <hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>DPC LOCAL ANNOUNCEMENT<br>
<br>
AFTER MUCH UPROAR, I HAVE GOTTEN PERMISSION FROM T AND T TO HOLD A SWCCG TOURNAMENT ON THE 13TH AT 6PM. ENTRY WILL BE $10. IF WE GET 10 PLAYERS WE WILL HAVE A 4100 PRIZE, IF NOT MONEY WILL BE USED ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF THE PLAYERS. I THINK JOHN ANDERSON WILL BE RUNNING IT. PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE...<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>That is a $100 prize. I do not know what a "4100" prize is... sorry for the confusion.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>Wow, Adam, $4100 dollars, i'm coming for sure ;-)<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, i apologize to Adam and others, I inadvertantly typed swccg instead of tcg.  Stupid names are so close alike.<br>
<br>
Sorry<hr>Andrew kcobal said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>Well ill be their man 100 hell yeah. I plan on winning it with my decks. It will be fun to be playing swccg agian for money.<hr>John Anderson said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>Okay guys, e-mail is below and check the website below too, it will have details soon (and if you are in the Dagobah Region, feel free to join). Andrew, there is no way you'll be winning. Myers (or me;)) will have it hands down.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please voice them over e-mail and we can discuss them in greater detail over the phone. Out of towners that plan on attending: try and pump this event up as much as possible and we'll try to best the DPC Atlanta attendance (15). <br>
<br>
Thanks so much,<hr>Andrew kcobal said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>lol i remember yesterday in play testing i killed ur decks by like 30 with my ls and 20 with my dark you have no chance of even coming in second man or first you talk alot of junk for a scrub hehe.<hr>Ryan French said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>When can we "start looking for dpc locals with enterprising event co-ordinators" near Seattle??<hr>Adam Drake said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Ryan, we are currently looking for local coordinators. If you are interested, please contact me with your info and the info of the store you would be running events at, and we will go from there. That goes for anyone who wants to run a DPC local as well.<hr>John Anderson said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Just so everybody knows, I had to post the tourney on the 18th on Decipher's page to get it sanctioned due to the late notice of me running it. It is still 13 July at 6 pm.<hr>Ryan French said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Adam, problem is i have a wild work schedule so i'm not the best person to go to for hosting big tournaments.  you wanna grab Keith Watabayashi in Seattle or Jason Herrin  in Wenatchee for this job.<hr>Andrew kcobal said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>well ill try to make it man because i have a job to worry about man and ill try to get back to you john tomorow ok man.<hr>Paul Myers said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Looks like I may be at the DPC Local w/ Jim too since Houston is getting shut down by my parents.  We'll have to wait and see?  What if we dont get ten?  Can we still pay the entry fee and just play w/ however many we get for the money?  Anyway, later.<hr>John Anderson said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Paul, yes if we don't get ten (which I highly doubt) we will pay the entry fee and divide the money however the top 4 sees fit. <hr>Leonard Chee said on Mon Jul 8 2002 <br>So, when is DPC coming to Malaysia or Singapore?<hr>John Anderson said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>Every be sure to show up at TnT Toys on 13 July 2002 at 6:00 pm. We need as many players as possible to make this a great event. More players = more money to give away.
