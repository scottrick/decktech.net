<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Big Star Wars CCG tournament news - Well teaser anyway posted by DeckTech on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Star Wars CCG players, I'm here to tell you, the future of Star Wars CCG is looking strong.<br>
<br>
<b>DeckTech.net</b>, your favorite online information resource for Star Wars CCG (Isn't it the only one online?) and the <a href="http://www.swccgpc.com">Players Committee, makers of the Virtual Cards</a> have agreed to team up for a group of <b>Professional Opens</b>.  That's right, qualify for worlds and win money at the same time, something that has <b>never</b> been offered to Star Wars Players before!<br>
<br>
This will be in addition to the regular multi game DPC events you've all come to love, and also in addition to other ways to qualify for Worlds next year offered through the Players Committee (probably State Championships).<br>
<br>
Also, next year look for more virtual card sets as the development team of the PC gets to work on revamping <b>Dagobah</b> (can we say new and finally useful bounty hunters!) and one with limitless overlooked possibilities, <b>Hoth</b>.<br>
<br>
For those attending DecipherCon, be on the look out for the following people<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Michael Carr</b> - DT tournament team member<br>
<b>Scott Lingrell</b> - DPC advisor for Star Wars CCG<br>
<b>Doug Taylor</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Andrew Howard</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Jim Colson</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Jason Robinette</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Josh Radke</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Greg Anderson</b> - advocate<br>
<b>Eric Olson</b> - advocate<br>
<br>
<br>
These gents will be talking with players, running tournaments and getting opinions.  Imagine that!  Actually asking what the players want!  Yet another first for Star Wars CCG<br>
<br>
Finally look for the <a href="http://www.swccgpc.com">PC website</a> to ramp into action with lots of info on the members of the PC, ways to contact them, and the complete collection of Virtual Cards for easy reference.<br>
<br>
It's looking really good I tell you honestly, I'm as straightforward as it gets.  You all wanted PC & DT co-ordination, and you are getting it.  It's going to be an amazing year of SW action.<br>
<br>
So was that "big" enough for you?<br>
