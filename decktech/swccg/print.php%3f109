<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Several Major Announcements Tomorrow posted by DeckTech on Sun Jan 27 2002 <br>Friends, tomorrow is going to be a big day on DeckTech.  There are going to be several announcements and happenings, so be sure to check in.<br>
<br>
For one thing, the official launch of our highly anticipated <b>Magi-Nation Duel</b> section will be tomorrow.  Also, all week we will be running previews of card design art from the new expansion <B>Nightmare's Dawn</b>.  They will follow the art and process of designing card art.  They are really well done, very interesting to see and the girl heroine is really cute too!<br>
<BR><BR>Also, there is a really big announcement for <b>Lord of the Rings</b> players tomorrow.  Can't tell ya, sorry, you'll just have to check back!  Furthermore the One Deck contest will be drawing to a close very shortly, any time now.<br>
<br>
Lastly, in keeping with our promise to bring the members of DeckTech,the hands down best Internet technology, if you haven't seen the <b>Card Browser</b> update on the Lord of the Rings site, go to it.  Yes, even if you don't play the game!  It's truly amazing, David "The Founder" Akers gets all the credit for programming that.  Go to a deck and click on a card name, and marvel.  You won't see that anywhere else on the internet, I assure you.<br>
<BR><BR>Ok, that's it.  Go have some fun, but stay sharp for tomorrow.<br>

I don't know what you mean about "the girl heroine", but most of the girls in MN tend to be cute. :)<hr>crash beedo said on Sun Jan 27 2002 <br>big announcement for LOTR players?  Hmmmm... could it be a DPC-type series of big tourneys for LOTR?  That's my guess.<hr>swccguy said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>i hope its a lotr dpc cause i need some cash to buy moria when it comes out<hr>Kyle said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>Is there a way to learn Magi-nation duel without buying the cards? :) I want to learn, because it sounds interesting. Like demo decks anywhere, or something? Rules online, maybe? What is Mage Knight like, also? I wanted to look into that. :)<hr>David said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>Sorry guys no DPC for lotr planned yet. :(<hr>lakituTELEK said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>www.magi-nation.com<hr>crzybkhd said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>Sellouts!<hr>ROMzombie said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>Sellouts?  What?<hr>Eldorian said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>by popular decree...if you make such a secret out of it...we don't wanna know ;)<hr>Dodger314 said on Mon Jan 28 2002 <br>If you want to learn about MND, check out Magi-Nation.com, where you can find rules and pics of all the cards out there.  I'm sure you can be creative with the thousands of commons you have from other games, and proxy until you get hooked on the game! :)<hr>Rypcord Kline said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>When's the Raw Deal site gonna be up? And don't you DARE build a MageKnight site before a Raw Deal site. <br>
<br>
1. MageKnight has no sales anywhere. [I've checked]<br>
2. Its not that good of a game, why not just play Warhammaer 40K where you get to add your own details to it?<br>
3. Its not a card game.<br>
4. Raw Deal is so much better.<br>
<br>
I demand to see Raw Deal up by next week!
