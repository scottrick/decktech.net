<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Qualifying for SW:CCG Worlds 2002 posted by DeckTech on Mon Feb 18 2002 <br><img src="/groups/global/images/sw.gif" align=left>The players committee has decided against State Championship qualifications instead they opted for the old Regional Qualification system. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Ughh, I have to drive an extra 600 miles to even play?&#8221; But remember, we are talking about a chance at winning $5,000!<br>
<br>
From April to July, Regional Championships will be held with both finalists getting byes into Day Two of the SWCCG World Championships.  These regions will also be used for qualification for Young Jedi and Jedi Knights World Championship as well. <br>
<br>
In addition the five major summer conventions (Origins, GenCon, DragonCon, SanDeigo ComicCon, and Essen) will play host to five Open Championships where the top two competitors will also get byes into Day Two of the SWCCG World Championships.<br>
<br>
Both Bastian Winkelhaus and Matt Sokol will be awarded Day Two byes.  Matt won the SWCCG World Championships at DecipherCon 2000.  Bastian won the SWCCG World Championship last year at FreedomCon.  Both players reign, as champions, will be honored.<br>
<br>
If you want to volunteer or sponsor an event, please be sure to contact John Arendt (littlejohn@idcomm.com)he will assist you with what you need. <br>
<br>
We have had numerous requests to post regional information on DeckTech. In order to consolidate all of this information we are going to post the information for all regionals at once. <br>
<br>
If you want your regional to be listed on the DeckTech Website send your information to littlejohn@idcomm.com. Some things to include are: Date, location, time, contact info, and link to your DeckTech Group about that regional or other website.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned here for more information about SW:CCG 2002 and the new printable cards that the players committee is extensively play testing/producing right now. <br>
<br>
Soon you will be able to print out new game text for your favorite characters and slip it over your old cards! These cards will be tournament legal so keep your eyes open!<br>

I'd say the majority of players who have qualified for Worlds in the past are Decktechers, so this is the place.<br>
<br><br>
It is true about State Championships - they are not part of the Regional Qualification program, but we'll be organizing State Championships later this summer for bragging rights in your home state.<br>
<br><br>
Because the player base has diminished, we felt that Regionals gave the greatest chance that enough competitive players would come together for a quality gaming experience.<br>
<br><br>
I'm gathering information regarding posted Regionals, and will report back here when there's enough to publish.<br>
<br><br>
Finally, feel free to D-mail if you have ideas about keeping this game going.  Decktech is the place for Star Wars players .<br>

Player's Advocate<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>I just want to take this opportunity to say thanks to John.  Many of you may not know it because he's so low-key, but John Arednt is the one of the best representatives of Decipher's games ever.  <br>
<BR><BR<br>
He's basically the driving force on the Players Committee for one thing.  Also, he tirelessly runs tournaments, posts great decks, plays, promotes the game, gets people excited, has fun and somehow, somehow, even manages to sidestep the quagmire of political bullcrap of DeckTech and Decipher.  He even finally got me excited about Lord of the Rings, no small feat.<br>
BR><BR><br>
Decipher, I know you all have this page bookmarked despite your denials, so know this.  John is one of your greatest assests.  Not only for the reasons I listed above, but without him, you'd have had to deal with a much angier David and Neal on many occasions.  If it wasn't for John, this post wouldn't even have been here.  Why you haven't snapped him up is beyond me.  If you were smart, you'd have had him in your marketing dept instead of some of the yahoos of the past.<hr>Scott Anderson said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>To the point:  The comment shows a chance to win $5,000.  But on decipher.com, and this site, it says $10,000.  Has the ammount been changed?  typo?  lmk<hr>John Arendt said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>Scott - quick answer - we'll be giving out $10K for the World Championships at DecipherCon.  1st place will get $5K and the other $5k will go to the rest of the Top 8.  That's a great incentive to play - anyone can have a strong day and find themselves in the Top 8!<br>

John is the best thing the players commitee has going for it. Without him it would be a joke.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>well, mike, frequently in life it's not what you say, or what you do, it's how you say it or do it.<hr>Michael Girard said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>In my mind's eye, I don't think it would have mattered how I said it, it just wouldn't have mattered.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>I want to know what's actually going on here. Decipher has a history of covering up alterior motives (sp?), so I'm gonna put some observations in the light for speculation. These are just my observations:<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
* Big D loses the license 1.5 years before letting anyone know about it to sell more product.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
* Now they annouce the loss, and they can't sell. anything They do a buy 1 get 1 free, but it doesn't sell.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
* Now they're giving cash to those who buy out their product in a final worlds competition, and people are finally buying.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
* Big D will most probably make more than the $10,000 worth of product that would not have possibly sold otherwise and finally clear out the shelves before these cards are worthless to them.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
* Then the cash flow is in question. Big D announced that "Decipher plans to award $10,000 to the SW:CCG World Champion at DecipherCon 2002." (quoted from decktech's news section) Now it's $5,000 to the winner and the rest spread to the top 8. Decipher's website was vague, but decktech was specific and player advocates said "yes" (quoted from the responses to the same news article) to the content of decktech's article, so I took this to be true.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
What's the deal?!? I guess it doesn't matter - I see that sw:worlds02 is a bogus money-maker, and I won't be there. Holland - it seems you blew it. I want you to prove to me that I'm wrong, but I don't think you can.<hr>Michael Girard said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>That is v.sad Steve.  It's not a money making scheme.  Of course they are going to try and get some money for the product they have left.  but it doesn't matter, because there are those of you that won't listen and you only have one thought left in your head...<hr>Steve Marshall said on Tue Feb 19 2002 <br>Mike, it just seems like everything Decipher throws at us has some underlying scheme that Holland doesn't want the players (and the payers) to know about. It would be nice if he would just lay it all on the line and be open with the people who play his games.<br><br>
<br>
I think that the player committee is a good idea overall, as you guys have been doing a great job as far as I've heard. I just wish he would give <b>complete control</b> to you and step away.<br><br>
I'm not going to get into the character debate that seems to be revealing itself on this thread between you and Neal because (a) I don't know anything about it, and (b) it's none of our business. But you have done great things for the game in AZ and nationwide, and I'd like to see people like you and Arendt take <b>full</b> control.<br><br>
As for having one thought left in my head, I was open to this idea. Actually, I thought it was going to be a really good way to give back to the players that have been deceived out of their money (through 5 sets), but I seem to have found Holland's true motivation. Like I said - if you can prove me wrong, please do! I would like to see this as a 100% positive experience for SW players, an apology for selling 5 sets before announcing the loss of the license, and a way of making good on that wrong. I just don't think that's why he's doing it, and that's too bad.<br><br>
You've been good to us (and me) in the past, and I respect that. I can sense some stress in your posts, and I hope nothing is posted that changes that respect. I hope this reads the way I wanted it to...<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Feb 20 2002 <br>steve, yes decipher is after our wallets, but that's not what matters, what matters is how they do it. while agree about holland being full of bullshyte, i think you misread decipher's statement as to 10,000 for the champion.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Wed Feb 20 2002 <br>naw, I didn't misread it. I was disappointed (not mad) that they were so vague on their website as to how the cash would be spread out. Then decktech says that the whole purse goes to the winner, and 2 advocates agree with the newsflash.<br><br>
<br>
And btw, you are right. They're a business - they are <b>supposed</b> to be out for our money. It's how they're doing it that pisses me off.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Wed Feb 20 2002 <br>Steve, you said "Big D will most probably make more than the $10,000 worth of product that would not have possibly sold otherwise and finally clear out the shelves before these cards are worthless to them."  <br>
<br>
that's not true.  they AREN'T selling any SW cards now.  to do so would be a breach of contract.  the RETAILERS are selling cards, cards they bought from decipher before decipher had to stop selling.  decipher is just emptying their warehouses at no cost to themselves.  <hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Feb 20 2002 <br>Actually Hayes, you are incorrect there, their last date to sell product from their warehouses is April 30th, Dec 31st was the last day to make new cards.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Feb 20 2002 <br>actually, hayes, Decipher's got until the end of april to empty their warehouses.  The rest will be prize support at the remaining tournaments.<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Feb 21 2002 <br>dude you did misread the statement. the only reason you thought 10,000 was going to the champ was because that's what they promised us last year. <hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu Feb 21 2002 <br>Actually even if Dcon had gone on last year $10k was not going to the champ, Juz said this himself on the listserv.<hr>Michael Robinson said on Mon Feb 25 2002 <br>does any body have anyi dea where the Coruscant regionals will be? and email it to me at morpheus436@aol.com<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Thu Feb 28 2002 <br>Come play for one of two spots to the Star Wars World Championships!  The Open is Saturday March 23.  Check schedule below for event details.  Also a big Lord of the Rings tournament for you LOTR Fans out there!<br>

The $10,000 for the SW World Championships this fall is not a sales incentive.  Since we have pretty much sold all of our remaining inventory already, there is nothing to be gained by putting up this money, other than the good will of you players.  We want to show that we stand with you guys.  And, while it is true and has been admitted that we knew there was a chance we would lose the license a long time ago, that was not fact yet and we were unwilling to roll over for Hasbro.  Everybody heard the rumors, but until late 2001 they were only rumors.  We believed that Lucas could be persuaded to keep us on and fought to keep the game going under Decipher even up to the end of last year.  While the hope was getting smaller, we were not allowed to discuss it by contract with Lucas, so don't think that we were trying to deceive anybody.  I know you think of Decipher as a greedy corporation based on your comments, but if you really knew us you would think otherwise.  We are a business, but one that is very concientous of the playing community.  I wouldn't work for Decipher if that were not true.  I would not have left teaching middle school for over 8 years to work for a company that just wanted to take money from kids.  Its easy to blame a faceless corporation, but we are gamers and nice people.  The kind that still show up for tournaments just to play.<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Thu Feb 28 2002 <br>Sorry for the clarification.  Only the WINNER of Florida Conquest Open gets a seat at Worlds.<br>
<BR><br>
<BR><br>
PS. Well said, Sean.<hr>Ricky Myers said on Thu Feb 28 2002 <br>does anyone have any information on when and/or where the coreilla (might of spelled that wrong) regional will be?<hr>Steve Marshall said on Sat Mar 2 2002 <br>Sean: Your comments are well heard, believe it or not. This is the first positive thing I've heard from D's side.<br><br>
<br>
I've been asking D to make me buy their products again, and it goes unanswered. I ask them to tell me why I should believe anything they will ever tell me (as a player), and it goes unanswered. I point these 2 facts out on this very thread, and I get slapped in the face by the Player Committee. So you see where my opinions come from.<br><br>
<br>
I, too, will continue to play. There is a small group of players who still get together, and I'm still planning to make an hour long drive to the next tournament just to hang out with some friends. Because that aspect is still fun. But if I ever host another tournament, I will ban everything from Coruscant on. These cards were overpowered, under-tested incentinves to make more money off players. No one has denied <b>that</b> yet.<br><br>
<br>
Thanks for the post. It's nice to see something positive from Decipher.<hr>John Arendt said on Sat Mar 2 2002 <br>I'm putting together a list of all the scheduled regionals so far - it'll be getting posted later next week.  The regionals won't be getting started April.<br>
<br>
Andrew Howard is pulling together the Corellia Regional, with some help, for someplace in Indiana - June, I believe.<br>

June 8th<hr>Sean Smallman said on Wed Mar 6 2002 <br>Hey Steve,<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that it took a few days to reply to you.  Contrary to what some claim, we don't check DeckTech out all the time.  We do make an effort to check it out on a weekly basis at least, to keep up with our playing community here.  We do try to listen to you guys, even though we don't always answer you.<br>
<br>
Considering what happened over the last year (slowly losing the battle to keep SWCCG lisence, Sept.11/DecipherCon cancellation, and a tough economy for all game companies), we try to keep our comments positive.  Thanks for your reply, Steve.<br>
<br>
During the license negotiations that lasted into late 2001 and even now that the end of them has come, we have not been permitted to comment much about them.  Nor would we, as almost every company would choose to not comment on negotiations even when allowed.  You won't find the answers you seek, as to why this and that happened regarding the SW license.  We gave it our best effort to keep it, and we lost.  We are doing whatever it takes (within our abilities) to reward our customers for their loyalties over the years, and I hope that you will see and appreciate that.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Sat Mar 9 2002 <br>Sean: Thanks for the reply. My final question to you is this: Why put out 5 sets in a huge, non-playtested rush after such a long break between Endor and DS2, then DS2 and Tatooine? (Ref2 only had 54 NEW cards, and most of those were combos, so it doesn't really count.) This is the disrespect that really gets to me. I know that you couldn't / wouldn't talk about the license, and I understand that from a business point of view. But to drag out sets, each one WAY more powerful than the last (and necessary to be competitive, since nobody says that the game is ending as of that time). If Decipher still wants to be one of my good guys, that's the last question they need to answer. I look forward to your reply.
