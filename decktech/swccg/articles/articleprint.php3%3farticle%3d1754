The card, of course, is No Escape. A card meant to kill Honor of the Jedi, No Escape, in itself, may be too powerful. This article will look at the entire conflict and the arguments for and against No Escape.<br>
     Let&#146;s start by looking at the cause of all the fuss. In July, just after DSII hit the shelves, there was already one card very prevalent in almost all light decks. No, it wasn&#146;t the ultra-rare, Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. It also wasn&#146;t any other rare. It was an uncommon, Honor of the Jedi. For those of you who have been hiding under rocks or shells for the past three months, HotJedi reads something like this:<br>
<br>
Deploy on table. Unless opponent occupies three battlegrounds, each time you must lose force, (except for battle damage, your cards, and opponent&#146;s force drains at battlegrounds), reduce the loss by two. (Immune to Alter while you occupy a battleground.)<br>
<br>
     This card was originally meant to combat the cheesiness that was becoming most Hunt Down decks. However, it soon became apparent that there were several other uses. Early force loss from Court was taken care of. Your Destiny caused only one force loss rather than three. Occupations weren&#146;t hurting anyone. Then, the complaints started coming. HotJ was being deemed a &quot;broken&quot; card. &quot;It&#146;s too good,&quot; people would say. If you went to the Decipher message boards at the time, nearly one in every five or six posts had something to do with how broken HotJ was. Players asked for everything from an errata to a flat out ban of the card. A majority of the population, at least from my observations, believed HotJ was broken. Let&#146;s see just how great this card is.<br>
     Granted, HotJ is a very good card. Too good, no. I mean, how hard is it to beat, really. All the dark player has to do is occupy three battlegrounds. If you are running occupation you have to occupy two sites just to deploy the effect. Plus, if your opponent controls your system it&#146;s canceled, so you better get someone to the system. There&#146;s your three battlegrounds right there. If you are using BHBM, you&#146;re gonna have to win battles, i.e. you need to have guys who can fight. Spread them out and occupy three bg&#146;s; not too difficult. The only deck HotJ really hurt was the cheesy HD deck that used 7 Vaders, 5 Tarkins, 4 Mara Jades, and a few Dr. E&#146;s. You all have seen a deck like this. The incrdibly cheesy, super-expensive deck. Despite the fact that very few decks are hurt by HotJ, Decipher decided to do something.<br>
     Out of nowhere comes a brand-new card, No Escape. The game text goes a little something like this:<br>
<br>
Deploy on Table. You may immediately retrieve top card of lost pile into hand. Effects, Epic Events, and Objectives are immune to Honor of the Jedi. At opponent&amp;#8217;s &lt;&gt; sites your characters and vehicles deploy -3 and your force generation is +1. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
     Let&#146;s look at the card a little more in depth. First, unlike HotJ, NE deploys for free, on table, and is always immune to alter. Do you see where I&#146;m going with this? It can be played with Prepared Defenses. Although, despite what some people think, you can not retrieve the interrupt with NE. That does not make it any less good, though. You may immediately retrieve top card of lost pile into hand. Just lost your Vader from reserve? No prob, just get it into hand with NE. Also, what&#146;s with the &lt;&gt; site thing? Did Operatives need to be hurt any more? Was DBO that abusive that they had to kill it? No. The reason they did that was to destroy two very good light deck strategies: Throne Room mains and Endor Local Uprising, both of which depend on &lt;&gt; sites and neither of which had become an abusive strategy. I don&#146;t think I need to even talk about how bad the HotJ part is.<br>
Well, I&#146;ve gone astray from my main idea. So, getting back to the main point, the problem I have is not with HotJ or NE. I think HotJ is a good card. I think NE will be an abusive card. However, I&#146;m sick and tired of all these people whining about how bad NE is. Remember, you asked for it. Don&#146;t blame Decipher for making a card to kill HotJ. If they see everyone complaining about a card, they&#146;ll change something. They did it for Asteroid Sanctuary. They did it for Operatives. This time, they may have done it a bit early, but remember: You asked for it.<br>
