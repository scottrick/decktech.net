<br>
Prisoner 2187<br>
Rebel Character - Lightside -- Destiny 1<br>
Power 4 - Ability 3 -- Deploy 0 - Forfeit 6<br>
<br>
Deploys only if Rescue The Princess on table. May not be transferred while imprisoned. Adds 2 to your Force drains here. For remainder of game, your objective cannot be placed out of play and, if Leia not on table, flip Sometimes I Amaze Even Myself.<br>
<br>
This card is a great new power for the Rescue the Princess, it gives you a drain bonus of 2 which is nice and makes RTP stronger because you can't put the objective out of play anymore. Also if Leia is not on table RTP only flips back. But be sure to watch out for Bane to scan Prisoner 2187 and makes sure that the Darkside objective can't go out of play either.<br>
<br>
Artoo-Deetoo In Red 5<br>
Starship: X-Wing - Lightside -- Desiny 0 or 7<br>
Power 3 - Manuver 4 - Hyperspeed 5 -- Deploy 4 - Forfeit 5<br>
<br>
May add 1 pilot. Permanent astromech aboard is *R2-D2, who adds 2 to power, manuver and hyperspeed. Luck of ability &lt; 5 deploys free aboard. Immune to attrition &lt; 5 when Luke piloting.<br>
<br>
This card is not that strong that people might think but still really useful in space decks. The only bad thing with this card is that your may only add one pilot which means that your ability aboard is most likely 4 and that's not even near what you need to get a destiny &gt; 0 against Zuckuss In Mist Hunter. In other words you cannot leave this ship alone unless your sure you won't get attacked by ZIMH. There is good things about this card trough, Luke Skywalker deploys for free and makes it immune to attrition &lt; 5, power 8 while Luke is piloting and hyperspeed 7 gives a new boost for the Our Most Desperate Hour- and Kessel Run decks. There is a good combo to this card too, manuver of 6, A Few Manuvers and Darklighter Spin which gives you a battle destiny of 8, that's awesome. Also the destiny of either 0 or 7 is good for both Sense / Alter destinys and battle destinys.<br>
<br>
A New Secret Base<br>
Effect - Lightside - Destiny 5<br>
<br>
Deploy on 1st marker. Yavin 4 locations do not count for Imperial Decree. S-Foils and your 'insert' cards are canceled. Once during each of your turns, may take up to two sites (or one site and one Effect) with 'Echo' in title or one planed system with who [Lightside] icons into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. (Immune to Alter).<br>
<br>
ANSB is a great card for players who loves to play Echo Base Ops. Start with Hoth: Main Power Generator, Hoth: North Ridge (Hoth energy shield rules) and get ANSB with The Signal. Now you can search your Reserve Deck for the three Echo sites (War Room, Docking Bay and Med Lab) you need to play EBO, also you can deploy EBO from your Deck which makes this deck better and faster. EBO allows you to deploy Starships for - 1, Force drain + 2 and your total power is + 3 at all systems. That's what I call GREAT. Also you might want to combinate this deck with Incom Corpiration and X-Wings, but be sure to note that S-Foils are cancelled.<br>
<br>
Echo Base Garrison<br>
Effect - Lightside - Destiny 4<br>
<br>
Deploy on table. Rogue T-47s are immune to attrition &lt; 4 (or &lt; 6 if matching pilot aboard). Once during each of your turns, may take one maintenance droid, Bacta Tank, Lone Rogue, [Hoth] Luke, [SE] Wedge, Zev or Hobbie into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.<br>
<br>
EBG is a card that can be used in many different decks. The first deck to use it in is in a T-47 deck, it makes them immune to attrition &lt; 4 - &lt; 6 if maching pilot aboard, that's really useful. They you can deploy Commander Luke Skywalker, Commander Wedge Antilles, Zev Senesca and Derek Hobbie Klivian from your deck (the pilots of Rogue 1,2,3 and 4). The second deck to use this card is in your Rescue The Princess deck, it allows you to deploy 8D8 (Maintenance Droid which frees Prisoner Leia) and Bacta Tank (Helps you to keep Leia on the table and is very useful). The third deck to use EBG in is a Never Tell Me The Odds deck, it allows you to deploy 8D8 (Maint. Droid - Destiny 5), WED-9-M1 'Bantha' Droid (Maint. Droid - Destiny 4) and BG-J38 (Maint. Droid - Destiny 4). Those 3 droids makes 13 for Odds on your side which isn't bad at the second or third turn in the game. Three words, a great card.<br>
<br>
Massasi Base Operations / One In A Million<br>
Objectice - Lightside -- Destiny 0 / 7<br>
<br>
[Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay.]<br>
[For] remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors.<br>
[While] this side up, you generate no more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4.  {Flip} this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls fewer then three Yavin 4 sites.<br>
[Place] out of play if Yavin 4 is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
[While] this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your total power is +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is &quot;blown away,&quot; add 3 to Force lost for each opponent's Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter present with a pilot character aboard are each +2.<br>
<br>
MBO is a quite a strong objective but it has it's weak points too. You might think that this deck would not have any chance against the Darkside, Set Your Course For Alderaan deck, but when we tested these objectives against each others we realized that the Darkside objective isn't much stronger than the Lightside one. A Force generation of max one per Yavin 4 site is not nice at all but the deck works still.<br>
Here we go, you get out Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay, you generate 3 Force, one more than your opponent (that's quite ok). Once per turn you get one more Yavin 4 site from your deck and that makes the deck much faster also imperials are deploy + 2 which help you to flip your objective very fast.<br>
After you have flipped it's you get out Death Star system, Rebel Techs, Attack Run and Proton Torpedoes from you deck to complete the Attack Run. Use the Rebel Tech to get Death Star: Trench. On about the eight turn you should be ready to blow up the Death Star. Get out a hit squad for the Attack and Boom, Death Star should be gone. The problem is that you need many bonuses if he plays SYCFA because the four or five sites he has deployed makes the Attack Run much harder, but if you succeed the victory is almost yours by then. Good thing is that your total power is + 3 at all systems and where you have a piloted starfighter you Force drains are + 2, sounds like Echo Base Ops, huh? Think, Captain Han Solo in Millenium Falcon at Kessel Force Drain for 5 and you total power there is + 3. Also note that this objective can't go out of play once you flip. Awesome.<br>
<br>
Set Your Course For Alderaan / The Ultimate Power In the Universe<br>
Objective - Darkside -- Destiny 0 /  7<br>
<br>
[Deploy Death Star and Alderaan system and Docking Bay 327.]<br>
[For] remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth or a Subjugated planet.<br>
[While] this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take one card with &quot;Death Star&quot; in title into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. You may not Force drain at Alderaan system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled.<br>
[Flip] this card if Alderaan is &quot;blown away.&quot;<br>
<br>
[While] this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 if Victory class) to Death Star system. Your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +2 (or +1 if Victory class). If Yavin 4 system is &quot;blown away,&quot; add 3 to Force lost for each of opponent's Yavin 4 site.<br>
[Place] out of play if Death Star is &quot;blown away.&quot;<br>
<br>
SYCFA is a great objective and a good addition to the Commence Primary Ignition decks. As I told eariler this might look much better than the Lightside one but in fact it's not that strong.<br>
You start by playing out Death Star and Death Star: Docking Bay, you generate 4 Force, 3 more than your opponent (that's an amazing difference). Once per turn you deploy a card with &quot;Death Star&quot; in title (Death Star site, Gunner etc.). Get the Superlaser with a Death Star Gunner and on about the 5 turn your ready to blow up Alderaan (might take a bit longer if you are playing against MBO) and then it rocks.<br>
Once you have flipped you get Star Destroyers really cheap out to Death Star and get them to drain on the battle ground systems you pull out from your deck with the objective. You should also use Kuat Drive Yards (use multiplies of Kuat and get out the effect), you get an immunity to your SDs and you may deploy them from your deck. A Force drain or + 2 where you have an SD. Amazing, Devastator Force drains 4 at Endor. Be sure to pack Point Man or Alter to get rid of Effects that slows you down (Commence Recharching and They're on Dantooine). Also watch out for people who's trying to blow up your &quot;Head Quarters&quot;.<br>
