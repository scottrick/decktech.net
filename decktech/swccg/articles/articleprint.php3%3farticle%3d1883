You that build all the guns<br>
You that build the death place!<br>
You that build all the gun<br>
you that hide behind words!<br>
You that hide behind desks<br>
I just want you to know<br>
I can see through your masks<br>
You that never done nothin<br>
But too build & destroy<br>
You play with my world!<br>
As your little toy<br>
You put a drug in my head!<br>
Then hide from my eyes<br>
Then you turn & run following the fast bullets flying<br>
Like Judas of old<br>
You lie & deceive<br>
A world walk & be gone!<br>
And you want me to beleive<br>
But i see through your eyes<br>
And i see through your brain<br>
Like i see through the water that runs down my drain<br>
You that fasten all the triggers<br>
For others to fire<br>
Then you say back at war!<br>
While the death count gets higher<br>
You hide in your mantion!<br>
While young people&#8217;s blood<br>
flows out of thier bodies & is burried in the mud<br>
You&#8217;ve thrown the world&#8217;s dear<br>
That could never be hurled<br>
The fate to bring children<br>
Into this world<br>
For threatening my baby!<br>
I&#8217;m born in a name<br>
You ain&#8217;t worth the blood that runs in your vein<br>
How much do i know<br>
To talk out of turn<br>
You might say that i&#8217;m yours!<br>
You might say i&#8217;m alone<br>
But there&#8217;s one thing i know!<br>
though i&#8217;m younger than you<br>
Even jesus would never forgive what you do<br>
Let me ask you one question<br>
Is your money that good?<br>
Will it buy you forgiveness?<br>
Do you think that it could?<br>
Oh! I think you will find!<br>
When your death takes it&#8217;s toll<br>
All the money you made will never buy back your soul<br>
And i hope that you die<br>
And your death will come soon<br>
I&#8217;ll follow your casket<br>
In a pale afternoon<br>
And watch as you&#8217;re lowered!<br>
Into your death bed<br>
And i&#8217;ll stand over your grave till i&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;re dead<br>
