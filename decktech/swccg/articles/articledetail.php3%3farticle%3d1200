When it comes down to those five questionable cards, I've provided help for you on what to decide.  First, always see if you have any cards that will complement nicely with anything else in your deck.  A good example is if your playing IG-88 with Riot Gun, you should also be playing with 4-LOM with concussion rifle.  It just goes unsaid. When digging for those last cards, consider the local meta and see if you could pack in something to take out popular trends.  Most of these good cards have been listed in my other article 'Choosing the Right Cards.'<br>
<br>
WARNING:  This article is not for you experts who always know what to put in.  I am aware I could have put this in article form but I feel it is easier to read in this context.  This is a list that reviews the powers of certain cards - many often overlooked.  Many of the cards are obvious and played by everyone, but I've included them becuase they just don't go in EVERY deck, but need to be mentioned.	So please read with an open mind and I hope this helps you out for future reference.  Just writing this article helped me plenty.  Not included are any cards that I mentioned belong in every deck.  (Refer to my article entitled 'Chooing the Right Cards')<br>
<br>
<br>
Dark:<br>
<br>
A DANGEROUS TIME<br>
For the unknown opponent, this card helps to clear things up.  Played best mid-game, you can arrange your opponent's force pile however you wish.  Stack up the doubles, put the cards you don't want him gettin on top,  (if you feel he'll spend force) and toss the crap on the bottom.  Works better with a monnok in hand.  If anything, it will at least make your opponent think twice about picking up cards, monnok or not.<br>
<br>
CORUSCANT  (ds)<br>
Aside from the obvious easy force generation, this card is better played as a counter.	Hold it in your hand until your opponent slaps down his coruscant then convert it.  1 drain is less hurtful than 3.<br>
<br>
GRAVITY SHADOW<br>
If you're packin air, this might be a thought.  The problem with the more powerful imperial sky cards, is that you can't deploy them all at once.  So just get em together with an opponents ship, and don't let him run away.<br>
<br>
LATERAL DAMAGE<br>
Another killer space card.  Has that Millenium Falcon got ya down?  Just reduce it's power and forfeit to crap, then beat the hell out of it.	Works great along with Gravity Shadow, once you know the ship's not goin anywhere, turn it into a flying turd and let it hit the fan.<br>
<br>
NIADO DEUGAD<br>
This guy is just huge.	He has decent forfeit (4) and a fair deploy (3).  For 3 force per battle, he buffs up to power 8.  Packin ground?  Best include this guy too.<br>
<br>
DANNIK JERRIKO<br>
Light Side beat down is becoming notoriously annoying.	Have you ever asked yourself, 'Didn't I just kill that guy?'  Dannik will take care of this, he kills 'em dead.  One cup-of-Obi-wan and a Skywalker-Ramen later, he's gonna be worth running away from at power 11-13.<br>
<br>
BORING CONVERSATION ANYWAY<br>
Light side beat downs are prominent and sometimes the destiny adders come with it.  Before considering this card, look around the local tourney scene and see if this cancels the stuff people are playing with.  A very versatile card either way with an excellent destiny.<br>
<br>
FRUSTRATION<br>
Many people know the power of this card, and some don't.  Next time you're playing your rebel deck, just think to yourself, if he played Frustration in his next control phase, what would happen?  Odds are you'd at best have to deploy a card.  I hope you weren't waiting for something.  *cough cough* Frozen Assets *cough*<br>
<br>
BUBO<br>
Eats Nudjs for breakfast.  Helps you to infiltrate the ever popular throne-room decks, and is also an expert spy eater.  Extremely powerful inside Jabba's Palace.<br>
<br>
SHUT HIM UP OR SHUT HIM DOWN<br>
Bacta Tank can be annoying.  Wedge gets harder to kill, that's for sure.  Stop the chaos with a used interrupt with a nice destiny.  Also cancels Death Star Plans.<br>
<br>
MASTERFUL MOVE<br>
The other annoying rebel effect, mantillean savrip, is easily taken out with this.  Also with a great destiny of 6, this car allows to search for the best two interrupts in the game, how sweet is that?<br>
<br>
POINT MAN<br>
Ok, fine, so Asteroid decks have all but disappeared, true.  But you never know and this might come in handy.  Not to mention it cancels Order to Engage which the key to destroying drop and drain decks.  A must for all you ISBers out there.<br>
<br>
CHARMING TO THE LAST<br>
Simple question: Have you ever seen Leia on the table?	Probably yes.  If you're packin two GM Tarkins and a few high destinies in the deck and have a little space, throw in one of these for some major hurt.<br>
<br>
I HAVE YOU NOW<br>
Stupid question: Have you ever seen Luke on the table? I sure as hell hope so or else I don't know what game you're playing.	This is a no brainer and definitely worth considering playing as many as two<br>
<br>
<br>
Light:<br>
<br>
THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE<br>
Blatant Statement:  I KNOW you've seen Vader on the table about a ba-jillion times, but that's just an approximation.  If you're packin Luke and you got some room, pack one of these.<br>
<br>
SMOKE SCREEN<br>
The strength of the imperials comes from big power and all around immunity.  Walkers, Mara, Darth- It's everywhere.  With this card, Obi-Wan can take out General Veers in Blizzard 1 or Igar in Tempest 1, and might even survive the battle!  If you have Obi, Luke, or DOS in the deck, this is a much more versatile card than TFISWTO.<br>
<br>
MANTILLEAN SAVRIP<br>
A great card for a weak rebel force.  Savrip allows you to spread out well, and have confidence that you will survive more than one battle at different locations.  (pack some senses to protect it from alter / masterful move)<br>
<br>
BACTA TANK<br>
Works amazingly well with a few key cards, especially Wedge and Kal Fal.  Gives a rebel deck the power to hold a site with ease, and issue pesky beatdowns again and again.<br>
<br>
TUNNEL VISION<br>
If you have a lot of force, this card is basically grabbing whatever you like.	Works awesome in almost any rebel deck.<br>
<br>
OUT OF COMMISION<br>
Recycle a destiny 5 and count it for a high destiny.  If playing with enough of these, remove their entire lost pile over time and make sure you only see each card once.  You'll only have to kill Darth once, isn't that delightful?<br>
<br>
GLANCING BLOW<br>
For the time being, this card works very well in duels during battles.	Also works to issue pure beatdown.  If you've tracked that 5, clashed Mara, and sniped Tarkin, smack Darth and then beat him down.<br>
<br>
IT COULD BE WORSE<br>
A versatile card since day 1.  A must for all you Hidden Base peoples out there.  Eases the pain of those security precautions we like to violate.<br>
<br>
FIGRIN D'AN<br>
Basically a free one card back a turn.	In the hands of the expert player, serves well to know where all the cards are in your deck.  Given time to survive, Figgie is a must.<br>
<br>
ON THE EDGE<br>
The deck doesn't have be focused on retreival to play this card.  Just playing one is awesome sometimes.  If you have a destiny 5 floatin around, or Figrin just told you where that destiny 6 is.  Count the cards, activate a few force, play on the edge when the big one's on top, then activate the rest.  It's free force and easy to get with a little finesse.  Secret Plans is a pain anyways.<br>
<br>
COURAGE OF A SKYWALKER<br>
If you're packin a Master Luke, help buff him up a bit when present with others or Ben Kenobi.  And, of course, smack a surprise on an over-confident Darth Vader wanting to duel.<br>
<br>
ORDER TO ENGAGE<br>
ISB is annoying!  Since there is, unfortunately, no Gravity Shadow for the ground, (let alone for light side) at least make sure your opponent will regret running away from you.  The perfect touch to that mains and toys deck you've got.<br>
<br>
TAWSS KHAA<br>
With the new bounty hunters and growing popularity of Mara Jade, Tawss is a force to be reckoned with. Experienced at bashing on Djas, Zuckus, Bane, and prophetess (she's all but disappeared anyways.)  A decent fight for Jabba and she matches up with Mara toe to toe, just make sure you got that destiny tracked or are packing a smoke screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Both Sides:<br>
<br>
SWOOPS:<br>
SWOOPS RULE!  Order to engage is nice, yes.  This does it all though.  Toss Darth and Mara or GM Tarkin on a swoop and punish someone for running away.  Any combination of 2 mains is brutal enough for the lightside.  With a plenty of landspeed, there is little chance of escape.	Also allows you first hit with cards like Sniper / Sorry about the mess.  Two characters can lay a big beatdown.<br>
<br>
SKIFF:<br>
Doesn't have the power of the swoop, but is the best defensive card.  Decent landspeed can cover ground well enough.  Load up the big guys and oversee the ground on your planet.  Works wonders with Imperial Occupation and Ralltiir Ops decks.<br>
<br>
DISARMED<br>
I warned you some of the cards would be obvious.  With the importance of lightsabers these days, disarmed is an absolute must.	Especially for all you dark side duelers.<br>
<br>
TRAFFIC CONTROL  /  REACTOR TERMINAL<br>
A great card in the hands of an expert.  Keep your hand under 13 to avoid that monnok, but most importantly, manage your destiny draws.  You will always know what to stack, and know when it's poppin up.  A must for all you card counters out there.<br>
<br>
GOO NEE TAY  /	BAD FEELING HAVE I<br>
This one is obvious.  Goo nee tay is especially important if you're packing mains.  M'iyoom Onith is always lurkin in the dark- so be careful.<br>
<br>
I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS  /  SURPRISE<br>
These cards are amazing.  If you don't feel like playing Imperial Arrest Order or its counterpart, try one of these.  You can retarget ANY interrupt that's applicable.  This includes Elis / Nabe.  What was that you say?  Vader and Tarkin are going where?  I think Vader just lost his proof of purchase for that flight, and Tarkin's gonna end up alone with Obi and Luke.  Also works well to move that revolution or presence of the force to help YOU drain, not your opponent.  Versatile, tech.<br>
<br>
WHAT'RE YOU TRYIN TO PUSH ON US?  /  THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY<br>
I only included these cards cuz they're awesome.  You know what they do, play em if you got some room.<br>
<br>
RESTRICTED DEPLOYMENT / WRONG TURN<br>
There are very few characters deployed by either side that AREN'T warriors.  1 force may not seem like much but it adds up.  Excellent addition to a LS force choke deck.  Also good for drop and drain decks.<br>
<br>
IT CAN WAIT  /	I'D JUST AS SOON KISS A WOOKIE<br>
This card is tech.  Undercover is popping up once in a while.  Play one of these and bounce the undercover, leaving the spy out for a turn... hope they had a site to run to.  Also works well for obvious reasons, gives you that extra turn to survive.<br>
<br>
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS  /  SNIPER<br>
These cards are sooooooooo powerful.  Take out that undercover spy, snipe wedge, blast tarkin, whatever!  Helps even out the battlefield.<br>
<br>
LOST IN THE WILDERNESS	/  ALWAYS THINKING WITH YOUR STOMACH<br>
Cancels a drain... sweet.  There's more though!  Make sure your opponent thinks twice about draining with Obi and Luke or Vader and Tarkin.  They'll want some friends to stick close with.  This card is game-breaking when played at the right moment.<br>
<br>
CLASH OF SABERS  /  YOU ARE BEATEN<br>
Both cards are usable for more than one part of their game text.  Clash cancels presence of the force, cool.  You are beaten cancels Uncontrollable Fury, important to cancel that card.  Use the search feature to move that insert further down in your deck.  Oh ya, use it to beat the snot out of your opponent too, almost forgot that one.  Remove a key player from battle. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1200"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1200"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1200" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
