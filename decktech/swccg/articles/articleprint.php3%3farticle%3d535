There have been many comments about Court being a limited, 'theme' type objective with little tournament value.<br>
	Well, there is some truth to those statements, and there is certainly nothing wrong with playing it as a theme deck. Indeed, I will show you some ways to go about doing just that. There are, however, some powerful and tournament-worthy strategies contained within this objective.<br>
<br>
	Let's start with a line-by-line analysis of each side, then follow with examples and deck ideas and strategies.<br>
<br>
0-side:<br>
*Deploy Audience Chamber, Great Pir of Carkoon and Dungeon*<br>
	- Provides a good starting force ratio of 4-2 DS to L.		Sets up for a variety of deck types.<br>
*While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one docking bay or [independant] starship from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.*<br>
	- Allows for more force activation and for quick			responsivness in space, both elements of really good			decks.<br>
*Bounty Hunters are forfeit +2 and immune to Goo Nee Tay.*<br>
	- This overcomes the main weaknesses of the bounty			hunters, making them fairly efficient characters.<br>
*You may not play Scanning Crew.*<br>
	- Eliminates the Jabba's Palace Mainpulator deck type, 		or does it?<br>
*Each player loses 1 force at the end of their deploy phases unless that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine battleground site.*<br>
	- Incentive to make Tatooine into a battlefield for both		players and create more interaction in a game.<br>
*Flip this card if you have two captives (ora captive of ability &gt;2) at any Jabba's Palace site*<br>
	- Not too difficult to pull off, if that's your			intention. Shows that the objective is designed to be		combat-oriented.<br>
<br>
7-side<br>
*While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy Sarlacc, Rancor, or Rancor Pit from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.*<br>
	- Provides easy methods for damaging your opponent and		retrieving force for you when combined with the rest of 		this side's text.<br>
*Captives targetted by Trap Door are immediately relocated to Rancor Pit (do not draw destiny) and Trap Door may not be canceled.*<br>
	- works further towards the goal of feeding Rebels to		the Rancor, and helps to smooth out some quirks in the		Trap Door card.<br>
*Opponent loses force equal to foreit value of each opponent's character eaten by Rancor or Sarlacc (place that character out of play).*<br>
	- Since both named creatures also allow you to retrieve 		force, this mechanism can create a massive swing in the 		game. For example, the Rancor eats Obi: his forfeit is		9, meaning you retrieve 9 force and the opponent lose 9 		,creating an 18-force swing in the game. not to mention 		that it gets rid of him for the remainder of the game,		essentially making other cards in the opponent's deck		useless.<br>
*Flip this card if you have no captives at Tatooine sites and opponent has no characters at same site as Rancor.*<br>
	- Flips back once your creature does its job, returning 		you to the benefits of the first side. This creates an		interesting ability for the Dark Side player which will 		be discussed more in a moment.<br>
<br>
	All right, so we know what the Objective does. Now, how can it be used?<br>
	There are 3 main types of decks that this objective supports fully, and there are certainly more that can be pushed into cooperation. This article, however, will focus on those 3 types.<br>
<br>
TYPE 1: The Bounty hunter / creature theme deck<br>
	First is, of course, the aforementioned 'theme deck'. This deck is designed to be fun to play, with lots of interaction and battles in the game. The 'theme deck' can go one of 3 routes: pure bounty hunters, Rancor retrieval, or Sarlacc retrieval.<br>
	A pure bounty hunter deck capitalizes on the immunity to Goo Nee Tay and forfeit bonuses provided by the 0-side of Court. This deck's main damage source is battle, although there are enough drain sites to win the game that way if needed. This deck will usually have at least one of each maor Hunter, with 2 of the really good ones like Boba and Ig-88 with Riot Gun. Other cards usually included are Mara Jade and her saber for drains and damage dealing, Jabba for more forfeit and ability, Boelo to cancel destinies, and Scum and Villainy for retrieval and cheaper deploy. Space is likely to be a bit sparse, with only a single copy of the better Bounty Hunter ships in the deck. This deck will never flip, for it contains no cards to make use of the 7-side, and wouldn't want to lose the 0-side benefits anyway.<br>
	A Rancor retrieval deck, on the other hand, wants very much to flip and introduce some Light Side characters to Jabba's Pet, the Rancor. The deck contains many of the same cards as a pure Hunter deck, except there are likely to b e fewer low-ability Bounty Hunters and more capture- oriented cards. A favorite, for obvious reasons, is All Wrapped Up, although I have seen Sandwhirl-Hunting Party decks that worked well. Once the Dark player finds a suitable captive, they have 2 methods for feeding the Rancor: Trap Door or Personal Feeding. Trap Door is simple, just fire and forget, but can backfire if the Rancor can't swallow its food fast enough and the LS gets a chance to attack it in turn. The Personal Feeding method involves using a bounty hunter (preferably Cloud City Boba Fett for the +5 forfeit) to walk (or fly) the captive into the Pit and ensure that the Rancor gets it right. The advantage is that the Light player doesn't get the chance to attack the Rancor if it misses at first (and, if CC Fett is used, the Dark player retrieves +5 and the Light player loses +5 force for each captive). Afer the captive is eaten, the escort follows suit, to be retrieved or re-deployed later.<br>
	A Sarlacc retrieval acts much the same as a Rancor retrieval deck, except it usually goes more for exterior sites and vehicles, to prevent the Pit Creature from attacking their own characters. One downside to this type is that the retrieval is limited; an upshot is that the Sarlacc makes a nasty obstacle outside the Palace.<br>
<br>
TYPE 2: The Jabba's Fleet deck<br>
	This deck takes advantage of the line on the 0-side that says 'May deploy one [independant] starships from Reserve Deck' to create a powerful and reactive space force with a relatively small commitment. Most decks of this type use very few sites and the minimum amount of characters to hold the ground stable, and relies on systems and ships to win the game. A major advantage is that the Light Side has to play on Tatooine or lose a force a turn for the whole game; another is that any ship the Light Side plays can be countered by one or more Bounty Hunter ships on the very next turn, whether or not they are in hand or not!<br>
<br>
TYPE 3: The much-reviled Jabba's Palace Manipulator<br>
	'What?' you say, 'But I thought you couldn't play Scanning Crew?'. Well, you can't, but when you have None Shall Pass, you don't really need it, either. This deck focuses on using A Dangerous Time to group card types together in the force pile (usually with characters on the bottom and interrupts on top), then Voyeuring the Used Pile to kill the interrupts and Monnoking the hand to kill double characters or to keep the opponent below 13 cards in hand. If they manage to keep an Obi or Luke and deploy it into the Palace, he'll be bounced back to the hand via None Shall Pass, then Miyoom Onith will eat them from the hand. Small drains can be set up inside the Palace using Gailid to increase drains by 1 and Mosep to make the force come off the top of the deck. The objective helps the strategy by damaging the Light Side whenever they lack characters on the table and by providing space protection if needed.<br>
<br>
	So, as you can see, the Court of the Vile Gangster lends itself to quite a few different strategies. It is not perfect; no card or deck is. There may be other ways to do the above decks, and there may be better objectives for them. However, Court is a single, versatile card that can provide direction and focus for a variety of dark side deck types. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
