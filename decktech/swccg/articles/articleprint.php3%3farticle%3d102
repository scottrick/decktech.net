Efficiency V.4 - Individual Card Efficiency<br>
Ryan Fojtik<br>
<br>
   This is a continuation of earlier work on the subject of efficiency, and is separate from, but an elaboration on other articles. See Volume 1-3 for the basis upon which this article is based, and the logic behind some of the assumptions to be made within. This article is intended to establish principals of card selection for swccg decks, and attempt to determine efficiency in a way that supercedes things like deploy/forfeit ratio.<br>
   So established is that ones cards must work together for either the purposes of disruption or damage, and established is that you must include the least possible number of each card in your deck to accomplish the goal that its particular strata or sub-strata intends to accomplish (goal being either disruption or damage), and established is that including the least possible number of cards of each type allows for greater flexibility as long as the principal of overlapping substratagies is maintained. So it is in this article that the principals of individual card selection will be discussed.<br>
<br>
The Sixth Principal of Efficiency in deck design: Individual Card Efficiency<br>
<br>
   In earlier articles in this series, it was established that efficiency in deckm design, and efficiency in terms how how well the individual parts of a deck work together as a whole (described in terms of overlap) is of incredible importance and often decides which deck prevails in a matchup (which can be determined mathematically, which will be the subject of later articles). So if the individual wholes (in terms of strategies) must somehow be a cohesive unit for efficiency, then by extension, the cards contained in those units must be optimized as effective means for the accomplishment of the goals set forth in those strategies, and so must also be the most efficient choice of cards in deck optimization.  What this means, is that in order to create the most efficient deck possible in a design, the individual cards themselves used for the particular deck in question must be the most efficient cards available to accomplish the goal given, so as to not violate the fifth principal (draw percentages see V.3).  So established is that we must optimize our card choices, so as to make our deck most efficient, and hopefully by extension, most effective. <br>
   Earlier writings on this subject have produced an array of methodology for accomplishing the determination of an individual cards efficiency based on the numbers contained on the card. Deploy/Forfeit ratio would likely be the most prevalent example of this, and while it is somewhat useful in determining how good a character is when considered as a separate unit comparable only to other cards, we are not comparing only characters, and we are not comparing it simply to the pool of cards as a whole, but rather relative to the overall strategy chosen for the deck, and the number of copies of the said card that would need to be included in the deck for maximum effectiveness, and its relative effect vs. the current metagame. Deploy/ Forfeit Ratio is simply the result of the equation D/F where deploy=D and forfeit=F. This produces a number (for instance .33 for Oola)assuming that this is an effective determination of the characters individual worth (which tends to apply to starships and vehicles as well). However, several problems exist with this. First, it fails to take into account the text of the character. So the inherent abilities of the character are ignored (power, gametext, lore). So established is that this method does not measure the cards efficiency in terms of deck design, rather, it determines the efficiency with which the card operates as a SINGLE UNIT, separate from both pool of cards, and any actual deck. Which does not suit our purposes at all. Further elaborations on this formula, and more compelx versions that attempt to take power into account as well have the same problem. Using the numbers on the card, it is relatively impossible to determine the efficiency of that card in terms of a particular deck design.<br>
   So since we cannot use the numbers present on the card faces to determine efficiency, we must then determine principals by which we may asses a particular cards efficiency in terms of its part in the whole deck design. The first principal of this is something that will be reffered to as universality; which is to say that when speaking of a card in terms of efficiency, we do NOT speak of it in terms of whether or not it is the best card out of the pool of cards IN GENERAL. This step is taken care of by the first principal of efficiency (metagaming) and at this step, we are simply determining the most efficienct cards for use in our deck for the accomplishment of the strategies laid out in that deck, and not in terms of the whole pool of cards. In effect, this means, that in certain designs, it may be possible for a Y-Wing assault squadron to be more efficient than EPP obiwan.<br>
   That particular example sheds light on the second principal to be considered, which is the number of cards required for successful use of those cards. This is to say that in building an elom deck, eloms are not efficient until their use in multiples, which increases their potency, and their interactivity with (presumably) the other strategies present in your deck (numbers, AFA, Nar Shadda, what have you). Another example of this would be scanning crews. Playing with 3 copies of scanning crew is not efficienct because 3 copies of scanning crew do not accomplish your objective (disruption) and thus are inneficient, because by induction, cards that do not work are not efficient, and your 3 SCrews do not accomplish the goals set for them, so thereby they are inneficient. However, once you increase the number of scanning crews, their effectiveness  increases due to their ability to accomplish the task set forth for them. So the second principal by which we look at individual cards would be that the card chosen shouuld be the one that requires the least number of the particular card to be successful in accomplshing the strategy set forth for it.<br>
   The third principal is an extention of the earlier strategy discussed in V.2, overlapping substrata. However, this applies somewhat differently to cards, in that they need not overlap to the same degree of integration that your overall strategies must, however, the extent to which they do overlap often determines the extent to which the overall strategies are able to overlap. This is to say that the cards in your deck should work together on an individual basis, as well as work together on a strategic basis in terms of your overall strategic accomplishment. A simple example of this would be placing a 'Captain Khurgee' in a scanning crew deck based on the ground, due to the fact that he is very efficient in a deck where scanning crews are present, he allows the inclusion of somewhat less scanning crews due to his ability to search for them, and he is included (presumably) in some type of ground scheme. However, Captain Khurgee would not be an efficient choice in a Walker Garrison deck with no scanning crews, because with cards like imperial arrest order, 2 power pilots become more efficient because their text and abilites outweigh khurgee's superior forfeit. A more complex example would be MWYHL. It could be Worse is included to slow early drains and to help against decks that will stockpile a large drain at a single site. What it also does, is interact with jedi test 1 by having a destiny number condusive to its early completion, and jedi test one in turn interacts  with ICBW because it reduces the drain on the particular site that ICBW is hypothetically being used on. Also, the lesser number of force used to accomplish ICBW aids in the deploy of EPPs, which are also aided by ICBW because ICBW's destiny is condusive for increasing the effectiveness of their game texts involving weapons and destiny adders. And even JT1 is compatible with the EPPs because it requires Yoda, which occupies DG:Yodas hut, and provides immunity to EPPs that would otherwise be vulnerable. And Yoda generates extra force, which in turn aids in the deploy of EPPs. Also MWYHL uses bacta tank to redeploy EPPs, and MWYHL provides some SAC protection, so it aids in the defense of the Tank, which aids in the effectiveness of the EPPS with both its destiny, and its text, and Yoda aids the tank by producing force, and even JT 1 helps the tank becuase it then requires less force to combat the opponents drains, leaving a greater number of force to use for the tank (or the deploy of EPPs). So we see that in examples of efficienct card use (in the correct numbers, the EPPs, Bacta, Yoda, whatnot must be inluded in numbers condusive to drawing them at the appropriate times and appropriate numbers so as to be effective according to the fifth principal)the connection of the cards' attributes forms a kind of weblike structure, whereby the cards included, regardless of their individual strategic purposes, further the use of the other cards present in your deck for differing (or similar) strategic purposes.<br>
   The fourth principal is that of relational value. Your individual cards must relate to the strategic whole and must be the most effective cards possible in terms of the straetegic whole. This is to say that you do not put a single X-wing into your jawa deck as your space fleet. You do not include cards from a strategy that will not be effective at accomplishing the goal that it is set for. You do not include an X-wing in your jawa deck as its space fleet because it does not effectively accomplish the goal of dirupting your opponent in an arena that you are not prepared to fight in. An effective example of the use of cards for this purporse would be to include red and gold leader starship cards and landing claws with a yoxgit. This effectively, and through the use of 5 cards will presumably (against a space based deck) reduce their drains by up to 6 or 7 per turn in some cases, and will also provide you with the means to kill individual starships/destroyers at systems. This would effectively accomplish the goal of disruption and warrant inclusion. The principal of relational value states that you must include cards in a particular strategy (to the exclusion of all cards that do not) that are the most effective at accomplising the strategy set forth.<br>
   What are the most effective cards then?? Cards that overlap. Cards that have multiple uses, or that can be useful in multiple ways or in conjunction with other cards in separate strategies are much more effective than cards that are single minded or that do not overlap in terms of the other cards in your deck or in the overall strategy. This is to say that you should include cards that are flexible. EPPs are flexible because they are effective disruption, and they are effective means of force draining. Jawas however, are not good at disruption because they are restricted to a single planet (tatooine) and may only be effective at force drains so long as there are many multiples on the table at a single time. So the deck loses some of its flexibility. Operatives ARE an effective choice of a 'weenie' character because they accomplish both damage and distruption in terms of adding to force drains and causing the opponents to become -1, thereby eliminating several strategies from even being effective from the outset of the game.<br>
   However, it is possible to formulate an equation that measures a decks efficiency in terms of the cards used in its design based on THESE principals. The equation is ((Mi/4)+(1.695Mn)+1.5N)/100. Mi is the number of multiples of cards present in your deck that are included in multiple substrata. It is divisible by 4 because at the point of inclusion of 4 or more of a particular card, many different problems start to arise with the use of that card (ie, grimtaash, having too many copies in hand, it being rendered useless by opposing counters, etc.). This means that if you included 5 ICBW in your deck, and you have some other usable strategy inherent in the use of ICBW, then they would be totaled into this category along with any other such cards, and the value would be 5/4 (if ICBW were the only card present in multiples in your deck used in multiple substrata. Mn is the number of multiples present in the deck used in only one substrata, in that they do not overlap with other cards present in the primary strategy that it is used in. It is multiplied by 1.695 because the result of the most inneficient deck (59 multiples of the same card) results in the value 1, which is intended to be the upper bound for this equation. N is the number of cards present only in single copies in the deck that are NOT present in multiple substrata. It is intended to factor in the efficiency of counter cards, and other such one shots that tend to be in the deck only for a specific purpose, and often go unused over the course of a game. Note that individual cards included in multiple substrata are not included because they are the most efficient use of cards (assuming by the principals of card choice in this article that they do in fact accomplish the goals set forth by the substrata they are included in). This equation is termed Use Percentage, and simply measures the individual effectiveness of the cards in your deck as they relate to each other. This can be used in conjunction with the mathematics discussed in the draw percentages article to form an equation that accurately measures a decks efficiency as a cohesive unit, which will be the subject, whether in whole or in part, of an upcoming article.<br>
   These are the principals of deck efficiency as relates to individual card choice. Your comments and questions are welcome at &lt;a href='mailto:XjedeyeX@aol.com&gt;XjedeyeX@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;<br>
