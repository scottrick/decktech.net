At one point, I had about 8500 tech points.  Then, I submited <br>
&quot;Brad&#146;s Unbeatable WYS&quot;, which I thought was the be all and end all of starwars.  I spent aproximatley 6000 techpoints keeping the deck at #1 for about 2 days!   But then, I ran out of tech points.  I needed a way to replenish them, and fast, so &quot;Brad&#146;s Unbeatable WYS&quot; could get back to #1.  But we never have tournaments here anymore, so I couldn&#146;t write tournament reports.  I was too lazy to think of decks and submit them, only to find that 4 people reviewed it.  So I turned to the articles section of decktech.  I started writing mindless jabber about this, and that, my life, my friends, family, girlfriend, ya know.  People seemed to like it.  I got WAY more 5, 4, and 3 star reviews than I did 1 star reviews.  So I kept going.  Before long, I started to build up my tech points again.  But alas, decktech has struck again.  First they docked me 1000 points because I submitted a &quot;type 2&quot; deck that only contained the text, &quot;sha-bang, 100 free tech points.&quot;  Now they have gone and deleted all articles.  All that work, down the drain.  Well, I&#146;ve decided that starting this saturday, I am going to archive my life in article form, here on decktech.  Don&#146;t even tell me it doesn&#146;t belong here.  Freekin Mike Gemme decided to write a bunch of fictional crap about &quot;a path to nowhere,&quot; and all you schmucks decided to give him 4 stars.  So now I get to start my new series: &quot;Brad in Normal&quot;  Everyone watch for it!<br>
