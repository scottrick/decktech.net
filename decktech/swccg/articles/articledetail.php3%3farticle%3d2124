Remember the words : Sith, always two there are: a master and an apprentice. But where would the lightside be if it wasn&#146;t for Yoda? No Yoda, no Luke, no Rebels, no Game!<br>
    Are you a Yoda / Palpy figure? <br>
Well i am, and it is the most rewarding honor indeed. A wise person once said that the only reason of living might be transfer of knowledge. I&#146;ll be straigt to the point: if you&#146;re not interested in becoming a mentor or a better one, you might as well leave now. This is intended for people like me, but maybe with less experience. Anyway, a new approach is always interesting.<br>
    The first rule is to find yourself a padawan learner. It is really the best thing to have only one student at a time, but if you become better it may change. There are more possibilities, but i will discuss them later. The padawan learner system is the most obvious so i&#146;ll start with that. Let me tell you what I do: i&#146;m always on the look for talent. I pick people with potential to become better than me, or at least as good. The goal? Well, if there is any kind of psychological ranking in your community it should be: your ex mentor on one, then you, then your padawan. It has been a while i reached independency in the &#146;apprentice&#146; stage, but i still have much respect for the ones who mentored me in the past.<br>
    Most of the times, i pick my padawan based on his intelligence and motivation. If they are not motivated, you might as well visit your toilet and then expect it smells good when you visit it later ;) This article is to become Master Mentor, but if yoda had to train Bubo, i suppose he wouldn&#146;t be as famous as nowadays. I have experienced that you best start with the mentoring process quickly too: pick somebody from the age of 12 to 16. You can really make them play your style, and that are the best people to train with later . (like mini-me &amp; dr evil)<br>
    If they never played before, but you see potential, ask them straightforward: do you have the guts to become one of the best damned players around? I&#146;m willing to take you as my personal padawan learner, i&#146;ll have no gaming secrets for you. They will be delighted! Then grab your cards, and give them two decks to practice with. Make simple decks and add the more difficult game mechanics like objectives and combat interrupts out. Especially, if you put a lot of weapons in his/her first deck, you will see that for the rest of their carreer, they will enjoy playing a lot of weapons. This is no joke folks, but illustrates how important it is to make them a good balanced deck right from the start! I have tested alot with decks like these and there are some suggestions that i can give with you now.<br>
<br>
<br>
General rule for first decks: no objective, no admirals orders, theme based cards, few interrupts and effects. No power cards that are countered alot in tournament play like it could be worse: they can be screwed on their first tourney if they play that. (no experience enough yet)<br>
Also, make 40 card decks to start with.<br>
<br>
DARK SIDE SUGGESTIONS FROM START TO END:<br>
<br>
Cloud city deck with trooper assault is great. Start with Bespin System and Carbon Chamber with Carefull Planning starting interrupt. Effects you can include is den of thieves &amp; battle order. First strike is just great in these decks! Interrupts should be limited to trooper assault &amp; blasted droid and a single wounded wookie or some abbysin ornament. Put in about 5 blasters.<br>
<br>
Speeder bikes on Endor. No this is no perimeter patrol deck folks: these are their first games and we want their light side to have a chance. Play carefull planning and start with dark forest and bunker. This deck teaches you two good game mechanics: fetching from deck and react. Put in blasters that react to a battle, not too much unique troopers though! Teach them the art of destiny adding and the value of having a good destiny draw.<br>
<br>
Imperial Tie power: The third deck you&#146;ll want to let them play with is allready a little more difficult. Aims with this deck is primitive destiny tracking. Yes! This is the time to teach them. Maybe this is the first 60 card deck you&#146;ll want to make, depending on what you aim for. Start with Wakeelmui, and Twi&#146;lek Advisor to give them Mobilisation Points. Put in a Kuat they can pull (they learned that on endor, starting interrupt mechanic should be well known now). Now show how they activate good force allready: cards interact with each other, enchancing his game insight. Now that he discovered Twi&#146;lek, he&#146;ll want to use the second option too: used interrupt. Teach how they can get an effect from their deck the best to make sure it is in it: activate three, twi&#146;lek, continue activation. Now they get Sienar Fleet Systems. Make a deck with a lot of dark maneuvers and not too much tallon rolls (never discourage one of his decks). Add in some dreadnaught, and learn the art of docking, and moving through hyperspace. The dark maneuvers should be tracked. Make it a game within a game: If he tracks a number of sixes: you give him a card he can keep.<br>
<br>
What&#146;s next? Objectives! Now it is really important to pick one of the most powerfull kind of objectives of the moment for them who does not require 3 emperors :) or vaders. I prefer My Kind Of Scum, since you can do great things with commons. Teach docking transit, shuttling, etc. Your apprentice is now ready for his first tourney.<br>
<br>
LIGHT SIDE DECK SUGGESTION:<br>
<br>
    To combine with the cloud city trooper idea, i suggest echo base trooper deck with nasty ice storm as their power card.<br>
Both decks have similar cards, so once he can play dark side good, it will be easy for him to play light side too. Important is to keep the power between decks balanced.<br>
<br>
    To combine with the endor speeder decks are ewoks! Use those ewok interrupts to make them fall of their vehicles and fun interrupts, so they will start to like interrupts.<br>
<br>
    To combine with the Tie deck, use a weapon (they learned that allready with their first two dark decks) space deck with b-wings, etc. Use intruder missile in your deck. They will adore that card! They will love the effect that allows them to forfeit weapons for an amount of three too!<br>
<br>
    What&#146;s next? Objectives! Here i would pick an agents in the court to start too, because it matches the dark side deck, and it is easily upgraded to a more main version once they gather more cards.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Ok now what? They can be discouraged the first tourney, because they&#146;ll probably end pretty bad. Tell them about your first tourney (except Maarten Logghe who won his first tourney). Basically this is the point: look how good i am! Even i messed up my first tourney, it&#146;s normal :-)<br>
You still want to be on the top? You will be! Ask them what strategies opponent played, and help them to counter those next tourney by adapting his deck a little. Don&#146;t tell what to change, let him make suggestions and discuss the quality of the card in the countering aim.<br>
<br>
    Train with your apprentice, adapt your deck so it is less powerfull, but always play to the best of your ability. Losing is the best way to learn for them, and the best motivation to continue. Keep them telling that there will be a day that they will win from you.<br>
<br>
    That day will come if you continue to be a good mentor. I experienced it before. Sander Valcke is now one of the top three players of my city, and strong players from other cities have lost to him. I lost to him too. (I still win most i guess ;) ) The force is strong in his family! His little brother, Jasper and his Friend Jonathan are about the two smartest of their class, and recently played their first tourney. Sander has friends too, and they are dedicated players. But not everybody had a good mentor. Some get discouraged, and that is your task too as a mentor, to involve them a little in your game spirit.<br>
<br>
    You know what one reward will be? Rating! I know everybody so good, i know their strong and weak points, and when it really comes down to a tourney, i can adapt my playstyle and made me a better player every month. I&#146;m proud of my third position in our region, but i&#146;m even more excited of our next goal! I&#146;m planning to invade the top 10 rating with at least 5 of our city. And we are very close.<br>
<br>
    Did you know that good players come all the way from France to our local tourneys? We have something here - a great spirit of friendship. We all like new decks, new strategies and unlike in the past we have so much new players now that the store has become too small sometimes! Tourney attending has risen from about 15/16 to over 28 in one year.<br>
<br>
    Then a special note for tournament directors. I have deep respect for them. I&#146;d like to place a word of thanks to Joeri Hoste, who has done so much for us allready. But there are new directors on the horizon! I recently judged my first tourney, and a friend of mine who is a little older too! That makes three tourney directors for our city.<br>
<br>
    Tournament director is the ultimate stage of mentoring. If you want to be a good director, you have to be respected. Joeri became respected not as a good star wars player, but as a great person with great motivation. Renau as a good player who evolved very fast into a top player, and me as teacher and player. I prefer the last one, because i still like to know every little detail of the evolution my friends make. A respected Tournament director has the ability to take care of an entire community, and that is a reward on itself. There is no need to know rules so perfect, although it is a great quality. If there is a discussion, you should be able to use your respect so both players in a discussion come to an agreement, as correct as possible. That&#146;s all about beiing a good judge.<br>
<br>
   What if they reach your status of gaming? Does your mentoring end? No! Now it is time for you to teach them how to use old cards. Do you know how much possible combinations of 60 cards you can make with the available cards? Near infinite! Amaze them every week with little new things you thought of. Discuss with them, mail them, call them, talk to them. If there is a new set, discuss new decks, make little bets on the new top decks. Discuss strategies on beating difficult decks. Try to suprise your enemies with a deck they&#146;ve never seen before. Rule number one:<br>
<br>
NEVER COPY A DECKTECH DECK JUST FOR THE RATING<br>
<br>
   Rating is third next to respect and game fun. You know there are players where i can leave a melas alone on a site and drain them for two the entire game because they &quot;know me and never know what to expect?&quot;. That&#146;s rewarding, especially if you had nothing. (i had nothing!) Once i tried a deck i didn&#146;t make myself, and had to play against Patrick Monsieurs. I got defeated because he knew every single card in my deck because he read it too! Why not go for repect and keep the fun in the game?<br>
<br>
   Decktech is for me a global mentoring program, more than just a copy paste rating machine. Keep that in mind, and you&#146;ll never get tired of Star Wars CCG.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
