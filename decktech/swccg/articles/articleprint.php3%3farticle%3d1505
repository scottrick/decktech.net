Cheese is dead, and all the cards point to getting more bang for your buck.  There are lots of cards to encourage battling, and force draining is back to where it should have been.  Notice lots of cards are wicked if you can keep your ability on the table.  Some of my picks are groups of cards that do cool stuff cause I don't want to waste lots of spaces giving each card it's own review.<br>
<br>
10) Commander Merrejk/Admiral Chiraneau-these dudes are a must have for any space deck.  These two smooth out the only two problems of previous Big Blue Space, activation and drains.	Oh yeah, Merrejk can be pulled with Piett and he's even an ISB agent.<br>
<br>
9) Colonel Craken and Lt. Blount- everyone played with jereon webb, now he's worthless. These guys are so much better.  Craken is annoying cause Mara and U-3PO are so good. Blount hurts ISB if you can protect him.	ISB isn't dead cause of these two, it will just have to evolve.  I will say drop and drain and ORS scum are really hurt by DSII.<br>
<br>
8) The Emperor.  Not jsut because he's destiny 6 and completely immune to attrition, but because he's got a million cool things you can do with him.	That Emperors Power is gonna be important when trying to cross Luke.  he deploys free to the Imp Square or his shuttle (btw, the shuttle is sweet with the emperor on it).  Janus and Sim are both solid characters that make the emperor more &quot;infleuential&quot;.  And what makes him amazing is Overseeing it personally.  You can't jump people with the Emperor, so you basically setup drains with him.  This is one of those cards that have &quot;force drains encourage battling&quot; written all over it. The emperor was well done.<br>
<br>
7) Jedi Test #6/The Way of things-  I saw two things when I saw this JT#6.  First, you can use the apprentice to fight without giving up a turn of benefits.  Usually you don't want to risk your apprentice fighting, but -1 to destiny draws, -2 attrition (DoS is already immune to &lt;4), auto kill Vader (you have the stacked card on 5), means DoS is somewhat safe. It's now a possiblity, an extra character if you need one.  The other thing, the more important thing, is a win condition under Come Here you Big Coward.  They really can't hurt you without battlegrounds cause of Honor of the Jedi and JT#1 and all you need is one damage source, this is it, they give you a spot to drain or die.  The Way of Things makes jedi testing a little less clumsy.  You save two turns of running around Dagobah, you become a hate hater (Set For Stun/Failure at the Cave).  All in all, MWYHL decks aren't gonna stop at test 2 anymore (oh yeah, Honor of the Jedi is amazing for surviving for the flip)<br>
<br>
6) Liberty-  Oh my god!  This is amazing.  You could run 3-4 of these and have a liberty in every battle.  Every deck will use this like they did Tantive IV/Spiral, I'll try and get my hands on 2 of them.  Lots of pilot seats to get ability 7 to hate Zuckuss.  Not only can does the LS have a chance w/out the Super Falcon, but it has the advantage in space cause of this and a few &quot;other&quot; cards.<br>
<br>
5) Wedge Antilles, RSL/Baron Soontir Fel- once again, sweet.  You have 2 options to use these.	The first is the lone fighter.	like a Fett in Slave I only you get some forfeiting power.  The second as the leader of a squad of ships.  You'll get high attrition with Baron, prevent attrition with Wedge.  Baron is pretty much restricted to his ship to get bounuses, Wedge is all over the place.  Solid cards.<br>
<br>
4) That's Things Operational!- I really didn't expect TTO to function like this.  A Solid deck design can come out of this and TTO will come out everygame.  Start with operational as planned and IAO, pull the D*II DB and put the Moff there, pull the DSII sectors and TTO, then jump to whatever planet you want (probably Tatooine or bespin).	IAO gets you the generic DB and the appropriate DB for the planet.  Accelerated activation and +2 force loss/turn occupation like.  Just occupy 3 battlegrounds for Honor of the Jedi.	I'll post a deck based on TTO tommorrow or something cool like that.  Sweet design once again.  Execpt that it's useless in an Endor DSII environment.  That's too bad.<br>
<br>
3) The Home One deal - Super Falcon what?  Start and Combat Response and Launching the Assault , pull Home One on the first turn, sue CR to deploy Ackebar with it, use Ackbar to deploy First Officer Thannespi with it, then rampage.  They have to have an entire fleet (or Lateral Damage, but you can use the anti LD guy if u want) to deal with it.  Just don't play Hidden Base, but do play high drain systems.<br>
<br>
2) Prepared Defenses/heading for the medical frigate-  This will have the impact of Battle Order/Plan.	Every deck will start A new Secret Base, Operational as planned, or this.  There are so many effects you can use with this.  One notable one is You cannot hide forever and its counterpart, which allow you to search for all kinds of Endor and DSII goodies (Honor of the Jedi, Security Precautions, etc).	Any deck that doesn't use these will have to play extremely aggressive to counteract 3 solid effects.<br>
<br>
And finally........<br>
<br>
1) Combat Response-  It's about time.	This should have been printed instead of stupid weapons ever since the beginning.  Decipher finally got the point that matching pilots/ships aren't good unless you have both of them, hence, noone played these ships.  It was always better to put 2 dreadnaughts in your deck then to put CC Fett and Slave I in your deck.  The dreadnaughts would always be useful, the ship/pilot won't.  Now non-unique ships will see less and less use.  The Fett in Slave I is better than 2 Dreadnaughts and all you need is one of them to get the combo.  (obviously the Fett example isn't a good one cause you just use ECC FiS1 now, but the point is made).  Makes the real good ships (Falcon, Home One, Executor) downright amazing.<br>
<br>
The reason the last two cards were the top 2 were because not only do they change the game immensly, but they also allow people without a lot of money to build competitive decks.  They also allow good players to become better and for newbies to learn the concepts of efficiency and become non-scrubs.<br>
<br>
Honorable mention-  everything but the weapons (and all cards pertaining to them).  The space weapons don't do anything but hit starships and the Lightsabers are excuses to get sabers into Endor/DSII environment, not something we can use.  Weapons that only hit stuff are useless, and as soon as you put in cards to make hitting stuff good, your deck is overcrowded.  I love DSII, it's very battle oriented and fast paced.  Basically, if you suck now, it's your own fault.  Every deck will be somewhat similar, but that's not a bad thing.	Decks that do nothing besides play Twix locations and magic bullets will die.  Decks that drop and drain and Ghhk and run away when that fails will die.  Every deck will have to balance between defending their own locations and attacking their opponents' locations.   Every deck will also have to balance between ground and space and be prepared to handle high forfeit 2-2 guys and Enhanced characters as well.  I give props to Decipher.	Over 50% of the set is non-crap, better than any other set by far.  You'll see a lot of different DSII cards for a long while.  That's good. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
