<br>
<br>
 So Shawn died, I wrote a post about it and that was the end of it, or so I thought. It wasn't the end for me, I was still an emotional wreck, haunted  by a feeling I could not get rid of. I was messed up bad.<br>
 Then something happened that told me loud and clear that there was something I could do, there was hope to be made of this despair. I got a call at work one day, again from Trina Cooper. When I got on the phone she was jabbering about a mile a minute and I could barely make out what it was she was telling me. After a couple of minutes her meaning started to penetrate and the sentence &quot;They are making a card of Shawn&quot; started to make sense. She had gotten a call from Decipher and they were planning a tribute card to Shawn in the upcoming Hoth expansion. I started interrogating Trina about the card but she did not know about the game and could not tell me what the card really was so I went to the source. I called up Decipher and was told that Shawn would be a light side character card in the Hoth expansion and pretty much the stats that eventually appeared on the card.<br>
  Needless to say I was blown away. First of all the fact that Lucasfilm had agreed to this told me that my little post had had a pretty major impact. As it was explained to me this approval by Lucasfilm put Shawn in the Star Wars universe as canon, he would be listed henceforth in their writer's &quot;bibles&quot;. And by putting his name on a character who had appeared on screen in Empire, they put him in the same universe as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and all of our Star Wars heroes! Shawn had literally become one with the force. From then on any time a Star Wars CCG player watched Empire they could point at the screen and say &quot;That's Shawn Valdez.&quot;<br>
  The other amazing thing about all this is that they could do it so fast. This was just before Star Wars really came hurtling back into the public consciousness with the Special Editions and Lucasfilm still had time to look at these things and make them happen quickly. It was also amazing on Decipher's end. Consider that Shawn died in September and Hoth came out by the end of that same year.  That Decipher  could get this done at all in time for the street date is a testament to their feeling about this. It was a very different time for the development of SWCCG, many things were done much more easily.<br>
 I can still remember how excited Maria Valdez (Shawn's Mother) was when I talked to her about this. She was still so hurt by the loss of her son and this was something that Shawn would have thought was so cool. There was no way she could refuse when they asked her if this would be okay. I know that it touched her and really made her happy even though it hurt too.<br>
  And I can still remember buying my first packs of Hoth and looking for that card. I was in North Georgia for the holiday and sought out a shop on unfamiliar ground so I could get some packs. The store I happened into was Galactic Quest, Kyle Puttkammer's (sic? sorry Kyle!) place up in Lawrenceville. I just kept buying packs until I got Shawn's card and when I saw it I got really choked up. The drive back was punctuated by a few stops to look at the card and cry. I felt like such a creep, for being alive and going to be with my family. I thought about Shawn's family and what a huge hole there must have been at their table this year.<br>
  This feeling persisted to an extent. It nagged at me and in early 1997 I decided to do something about it. I got on the computer again and wrote a brief post outlining a plan to start having Memorial Tournaments to raise money for charity on the anniversary of Shawn's death. I sent the post to all the active Squadron members via personal e-mail (I wasn't usre if this would be cool to do using Decipher's listserv) and the responses started coming in. By August we had a good list of SMs ready to make this happen and a charity picked out. We chose the CHILD Cancer fund here in Jacksonville because this was a charity especially dear to Shawn's family. The Fund gives money to the families of  kids with Cancer for the things that insurance does not cover, the human factor that falls throught the cracks. They pay airfares and hotels for parents and whole families to accompany children when they have to travel to receive treatment so that they can stay together through really tough times, things like that. It's a great cause and it's run entirely by the parents of sick kids, many of whom have lost children to cancer themselves.<br>
  So we got it together, a bunch of SMs scattered all around the country ran tournaments and donated all the entry fees to the CHILD Cancer Fund. Altogether we raised about 1500 dollars. Everyone who ran them and played in them said this was the best feeling they'd ever had about a tournament. It was a huge success in our eyes. Decipher noticed the posts we were putting up on our Squadron Listserv and Warren Holland made the event that much better by matching all the donations we had raised, doubling it to 3000 dollars raised!<br>
  We came out of that weekend feeling great! We'd all combined our efforts and together had made a big difference. Even though the next year's totals would blow ours off the map that first Shawn Valdez memorial tournament was really special.<br>
  The following year Decipher really got on board and turned the 1998 Shawn Valdez tournament weekend into the most amazing Star Wars CCG event ever. By offering special t-shirts and other prize support we were able to enlist Squadron Members and Tournament Directors from all over the world to raise money for the CHILD Cancer fund. Decipher also solicited donations of merchandise from corporate friends and distributors for an amazing web auction that ran on their website. Altogether the 1998 Shawn Valdez memorial weekend raised an astonishing $20,000 dollars! Incredible.<br>
  Shawn's Family turned out for the big event and they were treated like royalty by all the players. Maria was swarmed with kids getting them to sign their Shawn Valdez cards and it seemed like they really had a great time and felt so honored that this was all going on for Shawn. We even had the local TV news there shooting and I had to do an interview on camera. Scary stuff, but it was cool to see Star Wars CCG games being played on the tube!<br>
  1999 followed suit with a big promotion and a web auction, but by then it was all rolling of it's own accord with little involvement from me personally, aside from running one of the tournaments. At each of the 98 and 99 tournaments my events  each raised over 500 dollars, some of the largest totals raised at individual tournaments, though some of the other TDs really showed their stuff raising amazing amounts of money, as well as ingenious ways of raising it!<br>
  I can never fully express my thanks to all those who got involved in these events. What they meant to Shawn's family I can only guess, but I can say that they really helped me personally to get over this sad event and turn it into a positive thing. Seeing those couple of posts go out, tossed like tiny stones into unseen waters, ripples spreading ever outward to become a tidal wave was quite simply one of the most amazing things I have ever been involved in in my life.<br>
  People often come to me and say things like &quot;Thanks for getting that Shawn Valdez thing started, those were some of the best tournaments I've ever been to.&quot; and it is very gratifying. But it also makes me feel humbled and quite frankly a little ashamed. I can't claim credit for it no matter the good it did, because it was something I HAD to do. I had no choice in the matter, it was the only thing I could do to keep me sane in a way. Shawn Valdez and the incredible bravery he showed me, just living his life to the fullest and squeezing every last bit out of it has been an inspiration to me, it literally changed my life. I hope that I was able to communicate that to others and that it moved them to act as it did with me. To take a closer look at that person across that table, be it a game table or a dinner table, and realize how precious we can all be to each other. And how suddenly any one of us can disappear from the face of the earth.<br>
  I know it sounds sappy. None of this will help you build a better deck or improve your rating. But things like this can come out of this game if we open ourselves to them.<br>
  This story has a happy ending for me, and it has many happy endings for people all over the world who took the real message of Shawn Valdez to heart. I hope so at least.<br>
  The next chapter in my story is about the new way I saw the world and  how it made it possible for me to find the greatest treasure that the Star Wars CCG has ever offered me. And it was right there under my nose, at tournaments every week. I was just too blind to see. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1576"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1576"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1576" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
