<br>
That&#39;s huge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s look a little closer, shall we?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fellowship<br>
<br>
A Ranger&#39;s Versatility (please note it is NOT unique)<br>
<br>
1 Twilight (1?  Hello?  Decipher?)  Gondor Culture<br>
<br>
Event:  Spot a ranger at a river or forest to exhaust up to two minions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It&#39;s as simple as that, folks.<br>
<br>
<br>
First, it&#39;s not unique.  If, god forbid, they jump you with a ton of minions up the site path, you could play this twice. That usually won&#39;t matter unless you combo it with Pursuit Just Behind to wound whoever is left after you leave.  No, the real meat of this card is using it once, and allowing Legolas, Greenleaf to do his dirty work.<br>
<br>
Legolas?  Of course he&#39;s good.  But once you pair up minions=1 wound from death with companion who exerts to deal said wounds, you have a killing combo that will infuriate your opponents.  Combine this with the fact that Aragorn&#39;s bow gives Aragorn this same power...or that Power According to His Stature lets the ring-bearer deal one wound to every minion...it doesn&#39;t take long to see that your exhausted minions have a very dim future.<br>
<br>
Second, it adds only one twilight.  I&#39;d say this card was on par with the power of Sleep Carhadras and would be more worthy of two or three twilight, but that&#39;s me.  To say the cost is negligible is an understatement.  This leads directly to third, note that the card SPOTS, not EXERTS, said ranger.  Wow.  So this card is basically a freebie, if only your are at a river or forest....<br>
<br>
You take a look at your site cards lately?<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s a list of sites at which this card can be played:<br>
<br>
Site 2:<br>
Breeland Forest (Forest)<br>
Buckleberry Ferry(River)<br>
Trollshaw Forest (Forest)<br>
<br>
Site 3:<br>
Ford of Bruinen (River)<br>
Rivendell Waterfall (River)<br>
<br>
Site 4:<br>
Blessedly, none of these qualify.<br>
<br>
Site 5:<br>
Until the Balrog goes boating, the one site 5 also does not qualify.  Besides, the water messes up his fiery &#39;do.<br>
<br>
Site 6:<br>
Lothlorien Woods (Forest)<br>
<br>
Site 7:<br>
Anduin Confluence (River)<br>
Anduin Wilderland (Um, River and Forest)<br>
Silverlod Banks (River)<br>
<br>
Site 8:<br>
Anduin Banks (...yup, that&#39;s a River)<br>
Brown Lands (River)<br>
Pillars of the Kings (...there any dry land around here?)<br>
Shores of Nen Hithoel (...not even on shore are you safe.)<br>
<br>
Site 9:<br>
Tol Brandir (River)<br>
<br>
<br>
So...doing the math...that means that EVERY site except for TWO on the path could meet the criteria for playing this deadly, lethal card.  Even more scary, if you&#39;re having to face an opponent using it, there are so many with these keywords you might even be playing one for your opponent to advantage himself.  Yet MORE scary, sites 7 and 8 are RIFE with these <br>
<br>
sites...meaning that when you have the most shadow, your opponent will have the most defense against you.<br>
<br>
You:  &quot;Okay, Site 7, face a Troll&#39;s Keyward with Moria Axe, a Cave Troll, and a little orc.  DIE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Opponent:  &quot;Um....A Ranger&#39;s Versatility.  Exert Legolas one (ping) for the Troll, and one (ping) for the Keyward.  I guess <br>
<br>
Aragorn will squash the little orc.  Gee, I think I&#39;ll move to site 8.  If you&#39;ll pardon me, beeyoches.&quot;<br>
<br>
You:  &quot;Gee, I think I&#39;ll move to a store selling an expansion with some defense against this.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So easy as pie to use...but what about some defense?  Believe it or not, there is some defense out there for it.  Might as well pack some, as this is likely to be one of the most popular strategies out there.  Let&#39;s take a look:<br>
<br>
<br>
Moria Orcs:<br>
<br>
The Moria Orcs are in a particular quandry:  most are generally unaffected by a Ranger&#39;s Versatility thanks to 1 vitality.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this means that when a threat like the Troll or Cheiftan does emerge, they are easy targets.  What can the Orcs do?<br>
<br>
* Sites 4 and 5 are where to make your stand.  Make the Cave Troll really count here.  You may still have to deal with Hobbit Stealth so have a stealth canceller handy (which can be used even if the hobbits try to &#39;buff&#39; at later sites).<br>
<br>
*  Bitter Hatred--this one lets you spot an Orc Archer to wound an elf.  Although this could potentially be dead weight, with the popularity of Arwen and Legolas that is highly doubtful.  Makes Legolas have fewer shots (or kills him when he&#39;s through) and also makes Arwen&#39;s stick more costly to use (discarding usually hurts).  There&#39;s enough Orc archers to make this viable.<br>
<br>
* Goblin Armory--a Token machine for Orc Weapons, you can also pitch it to prevent a wound.  Sub-par use for it and it doesn&#39;t protect the Cave Troll.  Still, an option.<br>
<br>
* They are Coming--I generally disagree with some that this is a great card, coming from the old school of card advantage (and this is terrible card advantage).  However, this could let you focus on more orcs by pitching fellowship cards you don&#39;t need, and Legolas will run out of shots eventually.<br>
<br>
* The Underdeeps of Moria--let&#39;s you spend shadow for a shot at pulling an orc from the bottom of deck.  The best way is the swarm way, and if late in the game you&#39;ve got tons of twilight, why not use it?  A good card anyway that might be of use here.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s really it for these guys--some defense might help but you should hope for your swarm and card draws to do the trick.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Legolas can always opt to just add to archery....but that&#39;s another story, eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai: <br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai are blessed with Damage +1 and in general good vitality, and a few nasty tricks that might help them.  Thankfully, at later sites they have very reasonable shadow cost and any they don&#39;t eliminate can certainly make their presence known.<br>
<br>
*  Greed:  Ah, Greed.  Unfortunately, Greed requires 6 companions when 4 or 5 are more likely.  However, keep Greed handy to assist you in mowing down unwanted guests.  Greed will allow you to remove 2 shadow and spot 6 companions to wound a companion (except the ring bearer).  If they make the mistake, spread some wounds around but make sure in the end, Mr. Legolas bites it.<br>
<br>
*  Saruman&#39;s Reach:  An odd choice, and generally a weak one (this card should really be Sauron Orc).  This allows your opponent the choice of exerting two companions or putting on the ring.  Unless you build your deck around it, this is likely to be useless, but you MAY just bluff your opponent into taking the exertions instead.  You never know.  Still, likely a sub-par choice.<br>
<br>
* Uruk Shaman:  I would heartily recommend this guy except that he only works during Maneuver (by removing 2 shadow to heal a companion).  This will not save you during archery.  Should your opponent make a timing mistake, you can take advantage...but don&#39;t count on it.<br>
<br>
* Uruk Spy:  This guy combos with Saruman&#39;s Reach and may make that strategy worth consideration.  Whenever the bearer puts on the ring, you can exert this minion to discard cards from the top of your deck, and for every shadow card you reveal, you get to add a burden.  This would allow you to circumvent the Fellowship&#39;s tricks by going after the Ring-bearer directly and without combat.  I&#39;m not sure how well this works--on paper it looks a bit slow--but it still is a strategy to consider.<br>
<br>
* Worry:  Make the skirmishes you do get involved in count--when you win, and Worry is in play, the ring-bearer must exert or add a burden.  Again, going after the bearer himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Uruk-hai have numbers and strength on their side, and that might help.  Lurtz won&#39;t be of too much assistance here, unless you consider he will make a great target to draw fire away from other Uruk-hai.  Thankfully, the natural strength of these guys might help you prevail.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sauron Orcs:<br>
<br>
Sauron&#39;s Orcs really do have some of the nastiest tricks in the book.  You&#39;ll need all of them to help you around the nasty versatility.  Let&#39;s take a look at some of their best tricks and see how they will help you.<br>
<br>
* Band of the Eye--a big fat target that, if not dealt with, can really damage an opponent&#39;s hand...which means he&#39;ll probably be drawing lots of fire.  At 4 shadow, that&#39;s not too bad of a deal if you have more minions to back him up.  If they hesitate, they just might lose that precious Versatility so this is the perfect way to lure them out as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
*  Despair--I think this is difficult to pull off--kills and burdens combined at least 12--but I&#39;m sure someone out there has a deck that can do it.  Surprise them with this alternate win condition.  I doubt it would be fast enough against a Racin&#39; Ranger deck, though, especially one with Versatility.<br>
<br>
* Enduring Evil--Yummy.  One of the best cards in the game.  They want to start the Prancing Pony to fish out precious Aragorn?  Even better.  When you finally end up in a skirmish, someone&#39;s going to be overwhelmed.  Spot X burdens to make a Companion strength - X?  Yessir.  These things are certain to be like little golden tickets in your booster packs.<br>
<br>
* Hate--if Enduring Evil is the golden ticket against Versatility decks, Hate is like a gold brick in that selfsame booster. You must exert an orc to wound a non-ringbearer companion when you play this event (which admittedly could be a problem) but multiple orcs can make this happen.  Legolas?  Die.  Aragorn made use of the bow once too many times?  Bang.  Pure magic.<br>
<br>
* The Irresistable Shadow -- A good alternate win card, if they have five burdens and no draw deck, they lose.  Must be comboed with cards to make them lose cards from top of deck (and your fellowship side can even help with this) and you&#39;ll need to HURRY, but this might be a strategy that&#39;s worth a shot.  Try Orc Butchery to help.  Until, of course, they come to the tourney with a 100 card deck capable of &quot;downloading&quot; what they need.  In which case, bid high...to avoid the Pony.<br>
<br>
* Thin and Stretched:  Most Ranger decks aren&#39;t really ready for the Ring-Bearer to tangle.  Slap this on him to force the Ring-bearer to take a burden during a turn in which others skirmished but he did not.  Again, you&#39;ll have to exert an orc, and cards which discard conditions could be a problem, but this is still worth it.  Set them up for more Enduring Evil.<br>
<br>
* Under the Watching Eye:  I think this card has some potential.  Exert a tracker (which, if you play site 9 to get trackers from discard pile, makes this a decent side strategy) to force the fellowship to exert every time they move.  Since most trackers are small and cheap, they will be easy to get out and get this card going.  If they&#39;re racing to site 9, this will eventually prove problematic.<br>
<br>
* Weight of a Legacy:  I just had to mention this card, because it confuses me.  I mean, sure, it&#39;s going to be playable a great deal of the time (Aragorn is quite popular).  But just to make Aragorn strenghth -1?  Of course, this might help out Enduring Evil, so who knows how useful this is?  Might help in killing of Isildur&#39;s heir, but I haven&#39;t tried it.  No ranger = no Ranger&#39;s Versatility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nazgul:<br>
<br>
<br>
The decks for those with the cash, Nazgul are quite potent but they still have to deal with Ranger&#39;s versatility.  Here are <br>
<br>
some of their best ways to deal:<br>
<br>
<br>
* All Blades Perish:  Part of me says that this card is fairly sorry and there are better cards to play (say, another Nazgul).  However, this is the magic &quot;save the Witch King&quot; card, or at least force Legolas to zap twice.  Basically, if a Nazgul is about to take a wound, prevent that wound.  It plays for free, so I believe this might actually be a good answer.<br>
<br>
* Beauty is Fading:  Only really good early, before they get the Bow or Sting out, to take out Aragorn.  It&#39;s a bit expensive just to discard the Bow itself (at 5 shadow) but at least it can help you against it (but not Legolas).<br>
<br>
*  Black Breath:  Make skirmishes your Nazgul do end up in count.  The Black Breath prevents healing on the companion who gets it.  Works with any Nazgul in a skirmish once the condition is in play.  Keep Legolas or Aragorn from recovering!<br>
<br>
*  Blade Tip:  Combos so well with Black Breath that it really is too obvious to mention.  If your Nazgul wins a skirmish, place this condition on the losing companion.  They take a wound (or burden, if the ring-bearer) at the start of each of their fellowship turns.  Aragorn with Black Breath and Blade Tip is hardly as fearsome (and likely to croak without some assistance from Athelas).  Use the Morgul Blade to hit them with this even during the skirmish...though the bearer of said blade will have a GIGANTIC target on his hooded head.<br>
<br>
*  Relentless Charge:  I like this one.  Exert a Nazgul during Maneuver to wound every Archer companion.  Legolas or Aragorn with his Bow will feel this card.  Anything that gives them fewer shots is just gravy.<br>
<br>
*  The Twilight World:  If you can get the bearer to put on the Ring, you can exert a Nazgul to add two burdens.  Again, you&#39;ll be going after the ring-bearer directly.  This might combo well in a deck with both Nazgul and Sauron Orcs or Nazgul and Uruk-Hai (to play Saruman&#39;s Reach).  However, this does seem a little combo-intensive and specialized...<br>
<br>
* Ulaire Enquea:  My friend Brian Buchanan informs me this Ringwraith is entitled &quot;The Machine Gun&quot;.  By Spotting six<br>
companions or five burdens, you can exert this minion to wound a companion (excepting the ring-bearer).  I say that Ranger&#39;s <br>
<br>
Versatility will drop every time this guy does.  Which might not be a bad trade in the end.<br>
<br>
* The Witch-King:  If Ulaire Enquea is a &quot;play Versatility every time you see him&quot; kinda guy, the Witch-King will have your opponent flipping through his binder to get extra copies mid-game to play against the King here.  Which is kind of cool--if you play Ulaire Enquea, and your opponent passes, proceed to Maneuver so you can do some wounding (if you have an All Blades Perish, he&#39;ll even be wounding himself for nothing).  If he drops Versatility, play the King after Ulaire (if you have the Shadow).  Then wave g&#39;night.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wow!  I really should&#39;ve split this article in two, but I really got going there, eh?  Try some of these strategies to see if they help you the next time a Racin&#39; Ranger deck tries to knock you around.  Make sure A Ranger&#39;s Versatility is all for naught.  See you next time for.....Breaking the Card!<br>
