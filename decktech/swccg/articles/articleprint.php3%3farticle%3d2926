One is that they are quitting the game, another is that they will never buy another decipher product, one is that they are switching to lord of the rings, and then there are the people that are going to stick with the game. What will you do?<br>
<br>
If you quit the game you dont have to worry about blowing money off on it anymore, you dont have to worry about your rating dropping or getting higher and you dont get mad when you lose. On the other hand, you arent going to be doing something you used to enjoy doing, and now you might have tons of money sitting around doing nothing. You wont see your friends that you see at every tourney you go to as much. So there are consequences to quitting, bgood and bad.<br>
<br>
If you never buy another decipher product you once again dont have to worry about spending all your money on the cards. You wont have to worry about making new decks or worry about decipher cancelling a big event you were looking forward to and getting you really pissed off. Ont he other hand, your friends might still like the game and by a lot of you not ever supporting decipher again, they could gobankrupt or something, or somehow decide to stop making the game, which in turn makes all your friends mad at you. And you wonthave the joy of playing something you used to have fun playing.<br>
<br>
If you switch to lord of the rings you are supporting the company that has made you mad, you may not see your friends you made playing star wars as much anymore. The game may not do well and you just jumped on a sinking ship. On the other hand, it will be a great game that everyone plays and stays alive for awhile because of the movies coming out. Youll get to meet new people that never played star wars but play lord of the rings. Once again, good and bad consequences.<br>
<br>
If you stick with the game you could be staying on a ship that is sinking, you could spend more money on a game that could soon die. You wont see some of your friends that decided to quit the game. On the other hand, the game could survive and stay strong, cards could be cheaper and you wouldnt have to spend as much money on it and you would still be doing something that you enjoyed to do.<br>
<br>
So there are some of the choices all the players have, what will you do? </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
