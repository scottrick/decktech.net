Our first look at why Anakin turns to the dark side is saddening and heart breaking. The death of his mother and the relationship with Padme’ fuel his need to protect and become so powerful he could keep those whom he loves from even death. Anakin is a character of many contrasts, and as such is quite difficult to put into a card. Although I believe that I might finally have something of a solution to that. For the sake of our purposes Darth Vader, Darth Vader Dark Lord Of The Sith, and Lord Vader will be playable by the light side as Anakin Skywalker and are to have the following virtual text.<br>
<br>
Darth Vader<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker. Deploys –2 to Coruscant or Naboo. While with Padme or Obi-Wan adds 2to any of your destiny draws (4 if both). Once per game may deploy Anakin’s Lightsaber on him from the reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. Immune to attrition &lt; 5.<br>
<br>
Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker. Deploys –2 to Tatooine. If Shmi lost from same site Anakin is power +5 and immune to attrition until the beginning of your next turn. All non-unique aliens present with him are immediately lost. Immune to attrition &lt; 5.<br>
<br>
Lord Vader<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker. Deploys –3 to same site as a dark jedi or Padme’. May deploy and use 2 lightsaber weapon cards from reserve deck (even those not matching) for free, shuffle, cut replace. May still use a weapon if Disarmed. If Disarmed twice place in used pile and discard all cards on him. Immune to attrition &lt; 5.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to get around the Vader/Anakin persona issue is to hold them as Episode I closed tournaments. If this isn’t to your liking though the following are some rules that might help smooth the ruffles out. (Opponent may replace Anakin with their Vader at any location where he is alone during their deploy phase. All cards targeting the old persona are placed in the used pile. Like-wise you may replace the opponents Vader with Your Anakin under the same conditions. If Anakin on table Visage Of The Emperor and Your Destiny are suspended.) These short rules are very simple and easy to incorporate. <br>
<br>
Some specific scenarios in which questions may arise might be With Bring Him Before Me. If Luke is Vader’s captive is Vader alone? Obviously not but some folks still think captives don’t exist for purposes of ‘with’ game text. Do droids count toward alone? Yes droids count against alone. Do creatures trigger alone game text? Not unless they have total ability of 1 or more, but usually no. If I’m wrong on any of these let me know and I can amend it.<br>
<br>
Some other characters that are absolutely necessary for the Attack Of The Clone scenario tournament are new versions of Obi-Wan and Padme’ Amidala. For Obi-Wan we would use the version from Reflections 3 (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight) and for Amidala the best version I can think of is Padme’ Naberrie from Tatooine. Both need some tweaking to fit the style and story of the new film.<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight<br>
<br>
Deploys –2 to Coruscant, Naboo, and &lt;&gt; planet sites. During a battle may use 1 force to cause an opponents character of ability &lt; 4 to relocate (for free) to an adjacent site to “rethink your life” or be lost. Anakin deploys –1 here. Immune to attrition &lt; 6 (&lt; 7 if armed with a lightsaber). <br>
<br>
Padme’ Naberrie<br>
<br>
Padme’ Amidala. Senator from Naboo (politics of 3).  Once per game may deploy Anakin or Obi-wan from reserve deck to same site, shuffle, cut, replace. May draw 1 battle destiny if not able to otherwise and ads 2 to attrition of all opponents’ characters&#146; everywhere. Blaster weapon destiny draws are +2. Immune to attrition &lt; 4.<br>
<br>
Obviously there are cards that we can’t play with too. Which is really too bad since Jango Fett is a real bad a$$ in his armor. No wonder Boba Fett is so dang cool. Not to mention we finally see Slave I dish it out. We may not be able to play with Jango, but there is still Boba. He just needs some spiffy new game text to fit him into the groove. The versions of Boba that get treatment should be Boba Fett (SE), Boba Fett (CC), and Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter.<br>
<br>
Boba Fett (SE)<br>
<br>
Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots, and on Slave I adds 2 to maneuver. May play Double Back to cancel a force drain, and is a used interrupt. Power +3 while with another character wearing armor. Draws one battle destiny if unable to otherwise, immune to attrition &lt; 3.<br>
<br>
Boba Fett (CC)<br>
<br>
Adds 3 to power of anything  he pilots, and draws one battle destiny if unable to otherwise. Once per turn may take Hidden Weapons into hand from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. During battle but before attrition is totaled may move away for free. (Land speed =3.) Immune to attrition &lt; 3<br>
<br>
Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter<br>
<br>
Adds 3 to power and maneuver of Slave I, and draws 2 destiny if unable to otherwise.<br>
Once per game may deploy on him a Bounty Hunter weapon from reserve deck (for free), shuffle, cut, replace. Power –3 when present with opponents jedi master. Immune to attrition &lt; 5 (&lt; 6 when with a dark jedi).<br>
<br>
The next thing that I believe needs some amendment are the 2 objectives Hunt Down and Mind What You Have Learned. Hunt Down is pretty easy its basic design stays true no matter what, but the epic event Epic Duel needs to be amended to be able to cross Anakin. This is easy also. We can use Vader’s Obsession as the vehicle for this one and not even have to make virtual text. (When Vader’s Obsession is used to start an Epic Duel with Anakin it may be used by any dark jedi accept Vader. Treat the duel as you would treat the Luke/Vader duel using that game text.) The results are essentially the same as when you cross Luke to the dark side so they can be treated in the same way as well.<br>
<br>
Mind What You Have Learned needs a complete overhaul though. Because Dagobah isn’t even in existence yet and Luke is still a twinkle in his parents eyes jedi training just doesn’t seem realistic. What this deck needs is a new direction altogether. So lets think a little, what was in the movie? Clones, Jedi, and big war machines. Well lets think what we can actually remake in the image of the flick. Lets start with Clones. Aren’t clones the precursor to Stormtroopers? Okay, I can think of two cards to mess with here, the first as you guessed is the premiere Stormtrooper, the next is the big mean Stormtrooper Garrison. So we’re covered there. How about the jedi? Well they might need some basic tweaking, but not too hard to take care of. The cards to deal with here would be Yoda, Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Depa Bilaba, and Ki-Adi-Mundi. They need lightsabers too so I need to make sure there game text incorporates that. And Finally there are big war machines to deal with. And unfortunately I don’t think that these can be accomplished without actually violating license issues. I think that I’ll do the individual cards first and then the objective itself.<br>
<br>
Yoda, Master Of The Force<br>
<br>
Once per game may deploy a Jedi Lightsaber to Yoda from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. Power +5 while armed with a lightsaber. When targeting may draw 3 destiny and choose 2. Characters hit by Yoda are immediately placed in the used pile. Immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Mice Windu, Jedi Master<br>
<br>
Once per game may deploy a Jedi Lightsaber to Mace from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace and once per turn may take Armed And Dangerous into hand from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. May throw lightsaber (target an opponents character) at an adjacent site, place lightsaber in the used pile. Immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Plo Koon<br>
<br>
Once per game may deploy a Jedi Lightsaber to Plo from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. May place Plo in lost pile to place opponents just lost card out of play. Plo’ lightsaber weapon destiny draws are each +1. Immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Depa Bilaba<br>
<br>
Once per game may deploy a Jedi Lightsaber to Depa from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. She is power +2 and her lightsaber weapon destiny draws are each +1. Once per turn may look at the top card of any reserve deck, replace. Discard Depa to make that card lost. Immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Ki-Adi-Mundi<br>
<br>
Once per game may deploy a Jedi Lightsaber to Ki-Adi from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. When opponent initiates battle with Ki-Adi reveal their hand. Opponent discards one of those cards of your choice. Immune to attrition &lt; 6.<br>
<br>
Stormtrooper<br>
<br>
Clonetrooper. Deploys only to the same site as a jedi or another clonetrooper. When armed with a blaster that weapons destiny draws are +2 and hit characters are forfeit –4. May sacrifice to cancel all attrition against you in this battle. <br>
<br>
Stormtrooper Garrison<br>
<br>
Clonetrooper. Power – 4 if not with a jedi. May take a blaster into hand from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. Your jedi may not be targeted by weapons until all clonetroopers present are hit. Immune to attrition &lt; 3.<br>
<br>
Now that you see the characters you can see where this is going. Now let me address that objective.<br>
<br>
Mind What You Have Learned…<br>
<br>
Deploy the Jedi Council Chamber, and a planet system from parsec 5-7. <br>
<br>
For Remainder Of Game- Your Jedi Lightsaber force drain bonuses are immune to Jedi Council Chamber and you may not play Luke, Leia, Han, or Chewie.<br>
<br>
While This Side Up- May deploy one &lt;&gt; site to your planet. May take one Clonetrooper into hand from reserve deck, shuffle, cut, replace. Opponents Dark Jedi and Trade Federation Droids are deploy +2 to your planet sites. Your characters are immune to Bad Feeling Have I.<br>
<br>
Flip- If you control 2 sites (with a jedi and clonetrooper) and opponent controls none of your planet sites.<br>
<br>
<br>
Save You It Can…<br>
<br>
Immediately- Retrieve 10 force. Force retrieved may not be affected by Secret Plans.<br>
<br>
While This Side Up- Opponents Dark Jedi and Trade Federation Droids are forfeit –4 and lose all immunity to attrition. You may not deploy any starships or vehicles and force lost from force drains or insert cards is reduced to a maximum of 1. During your control phase use 3 force to retrieve a card from your lost pile.<br>
<br>
Flip- If your opponent controls 2 &lt;&gt; planet sites and you control &lt; 3 &lt;&gt; planet sites.<br>
<br>
That’s pretty much it in a nutshell folks. It should play out pretty well. Give it a try and tell me what you think.<br>
