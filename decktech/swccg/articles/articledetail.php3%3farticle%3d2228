For Premiere, Sense and Alter (for both sides) was SW:CCG.  If you won a Sense/Alter war, the game was yours.  When players used six or seven Senses and Alters in one war, the winner had a twelve card swing by winning.  Huge.  If you couldn&amp;#8217;t cancel your opponents I Have You Now, Skywalkers, or Lightsaber Proficiency, you could very well lose the game because of it.  The canceling of interrupts and effects and the Sense/Alter war was so huge in the early days of Star Wars that every deck packed 4 or 5 of each of these.  The first step Decipher took in anti-Sense/Alter tech was For Luck/Dark Forces, from the Jedi Pack.  They allowed you to exclude X Jedi using X Force from Sense/Alter draws.  This wasn&amp;#8217;t too devastating to Sense and Alter though, because most decks packed so many mains, that Motti could be used for Sense/Alter and succeed by drawing a one or zero(character, Star Destroyer, location etc.)  Every deck packed lots of these cards.  There was no reason not to, until the release of A New Hope.<br>
<br>
A New Hope released one of the best cards ever, in response to the &amp;#8216;over-use&amp;#8217; of Sense and Alter: Grimtaash and Monnok.  These cards were huge.  People still packed Sense to counter stuff, but if your opponent had no characters on the table and you had a Monnok or Grimtaash in your hand, you can be sure that it would be played on second turn, in hopes that you can nail Vader, Tarkin, Obi or some other mains or interrupts.  The effect of these cards was so great that they are still being played in most decks today, but in fewer numbers.  One does not need to pack 3 or more of Monnok or Grimtaash in each deck because interrupts (Masterful Move) and effects (Crush the Rebellion and Scrambled Transmission) can pull these cards (the effects pull the combo cards, obviously).  In addition, What Are You Trying to Push On Us and There&amp;#8217;ll be Hell to Pay (affectionately called &amp;#8216;grabbers&amp;#8217;) were released.  Some players realized their power back in the day, but until Special Edition, they were not very common in most decks.<br>
<br>
Dagobah turned the world of Star Wars upside down with the release of inserts.  Previously, the only insert was in Premiere (A Tremor/Disturbance in the Force), which was nothing more than an inconvenience for the opponent, thus not widely played.  3720 to 1 and Never Tell Me the Odds changed decks completely.  Now, a player had to be careful.  He could never over-activate, for fear of popping an insert.  He had to choose his characters wisely; no longer could a player have Obi, Luke, Han and Leia on the table and be considered to have the advantage, especially when the opponent had Tech Mor and two 4-destiny droids on the table.  Once that insert popped, the Light Side player would be losing 11 force.  Huge.  In addition, these monsters were immune to Alter; Alter was looking more and more useless, and a player had to be afraid that by drawing a destiny for Sense or Alter, the insert might pop.  Decipher also released Do Or Do Not/There Is No Try, which put hurting on decks that relied heavily on Sense and Alter.  People almost immediately stopped playing mass amounts of Sense and Alter after these cards hit the card stores.  Who wanted to lose three force to cancel one interrupt or effect, anyway?  Control made its appearance, a card that was so powerful, people packed four in every deck.  Canceling a force drain was so huge, plus it could nail a Sense or Alter with immunity to being Sensed itself.  Finally, Visored Vision and Voyeur were also released in this set, which were clearly more Sense and Alter hatred.<br>
<br>
Because Sense and Alter were not being played, a lot of decks that relied on multiple copies of an interrupt came to be.  Dark side trooper decks hit the table with Trooper Assault in Cloud City.  Scanning Crew was being used a lot more with Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace (and that broken Expand the Empire start).  After Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace came out and the concept of starting interrupts was introduced, people began playing Resistance and Ultimatum, cards made to combat the broken nature of inserts.  Because of this, inserts began to fade away.  Mains made a brief reappearance, as did SA (SA for Sense and Alter &amp;#8211; I am getting lazy) for the Light Side.  Dark decks were more centered around Scum and Villainy decks with aliens like Abyssins, etc. This was not for long though; Special Edition came out and hurt SAC once again.<br>
MWYHL and HDADTJ made attacks against SA.  The +4 on the 0-side to destiny draws, and the prohibition of opponents SA on the other made SA tougher and tougher to be viable in decks.  Perhaps I would play it in my HD or Testing deck, but not a lot of it, because the +4 hurts me too.  Once I flip, it would be nice to have, but I can&amp;#8217;t justify having 8 cards in my deck that are useful only if I flip.  So, SA was still played, but in much lower quantities that two years prior.  Also, Oppressive Enforcement and Wise Advise were great anti-SA cards; if my opponent cancelled my crucial interrupt or effect, I get to put it in my used pile so my whole deck doesn&amp;#8217;t sh*t the bed.  Great.  Coupled with DODN/TINT, those two cards provided great SA defense, with grabbers putting the final nail in SA&amp;#8217;s coffin.  Or did it?<br>
<br>
Death Star II saw a surprising resurrection of SA &amp;#8211; for the Dark Side.  BHBM was a great platform for SA.  Being able to pull Palpatine, 7 ability character, with an objective that did not impede your SACing ability was huge.  Decks such as the Beast and general beat-down-and-sense/alter-all-the-shiznit-you-throw-at-me decks were extremely popular.  The Light Side had two choices; either match their SA or just defend against it.  With the introduction of HFTMF, many people chose to start DODN and Wise Advise and play grabbers for SA.  Some still stuck by SA.  Until Reflections II came out.<br>
<br>
Reflections II, IMHO, is the death of SA.  The combo TINT/OE and DODN/WA cards being immune to Alter (thus startable with PD and HFTMF) was good enough to put a serious wound to SA.  Also, Watch Your Step may have killed SA totally.  The Light Side obviously wants to flip WYS so they can get their huge bonuses provided by the Objective.  When they are flipped, they can&amp;#8217;t play SA, so they don&amp;#8217;t pack it, nor do they need to pack defense against it.  The Dark has a choice; play SA defense only (if that) or wind up with 8+ wasted card slots.  The better choice is to chuck SA all together.  At best, play with the combo cards so you can use them for their counterparts.  Against WYS though, you can&amp;#8217;t even do that.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
What does this mean for Star Wars: CCG?  Well, there are a lot more card slots now open for &amp;#8216;tech.&amp;#8217;  This is cool, IMO.  I love seeing a card that I previously though would never be played.  It also opens up room for more characters, more starships, etc.  Thus more battles, more combos, more cool stuff in general.  For the amount of time that SA was used in the movie, it got more than its measure of fame in the card game.  Good bye and good riddance.  <br>
<br>
&amp;#8220;Of course, that&amp;#8217;s just my opinion; I could be wrong.&amp;#8221; <br>
