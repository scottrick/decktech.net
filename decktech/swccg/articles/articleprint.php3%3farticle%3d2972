The first thing I have to say is this; Reflections III is a good set. The overall quality in the cards and the new material the foils are printed on is by far above the current standard that Decipher has been operating under. With that said I’d like address some of the changes that have been brought to the table from this latest set.<br>
<br>
I know it has been discussed before and probably better, but I’d like to waste a few words on defensive shields. The DS is one of the most needed and least addressed issues in Star Wars today. They deal with the ‘one’ card that would really kill some ones entire deck. They even went as far as to print shields for the dark to kill Order To Engage. In the new light objective We’ll Handle This, that card is disgusting. They have to have dark jedi at the same site as you to combat and if they play the dark version then they CANNOT BATTLE you and lose force. In my opinion, that was a smart move. Bad move though is not making the new Conduct Your Search more carefully. Having to rule on the card 3 days after putting it into circulation is bad planning. One thing for all of you Lightsaber combat fans to remember is this, the deck dies to suicide beat downs and EPP’s. That’s right suicide missions kill this deck, so protect yourself.<br>
<br>
The darks best form of defense for this deck is to start All Wrapped Up with the other cards and include 2 copies of disarmed, 2 of We have A Prisoner and call it good. Also Cool Crawfish kicks some major behind. Include R3 Boba Fett, Aurra Sing and blaster rifle, 4-LOM with gun, and the mighty Snoova with axe. 2 Stormtrooper Garrisons don’t hurt either. Trust me, these slight changes in the mix fortify the deck greatly against nasty beat down decks and still let you do the Lightsaber combat part of the deck. Oh, I almost forgot. Include the premiere Dr. Evazan for his ability to lose a disarmed character as well.<br>
<br>
The light side got the shorter end of the stick though. (Maybe not.) They could fortify with EPP Hans, Chewies, Leias, and Obi-Wans. Start a battle and play Blast The Door Kid! To take their jedi out of the fight and proceed to kick the crap out of the remaining scrubs. Since you can’t Clash and you can’t SATM, you have to settle for Disarmed X2. Be sure to include Slight Weapons Malfunction and a couple Bionic Hands. Another good approach is to dump some copies of Jar Jar into the deck with his pole X2. Jedi’s Resilience X3, Gift of the Mentor X3 and its all good. Lots of easy to stack destiny and this deck does pretty well. Big problem though is the opponent’s drains. To deal with this use a couple Projection Of A Skywalker and A Vergeance In The Force. That should help the deck out a lot.<br>
<br>
Finally, the podrace has been slowed down and made a little more equitable. Love it or hate it the race was a good source of damage/retrieval for both sides of the force. Now though the damage aspect has been toned down and left the retrieval to its full benefit. Mostly any how, the light and dark both target their add on effects hence restricting it to the basic 6 up and 6 down. Of course the 3 turn race with Sebulba drawing 7s each turn is foul too. Defenses don’t seem to go up that fast as it is. Enough about the race.<br>
<br>
Let’s talk some about the new mains. We’ll hit em&#146; one by one.<br>
<br>
Lord Maul- Wow! This guy has increased basic immunity to attrition, 6 instead of 5. This gives him a little more staying power versus the smaller scrubs out there in the world today. Since multi-battle destinies is becoming the norm again it helps a lot. The rest of his text is only really useful in the new objective though. All in all a good rounded card.<br>
<br>
Qui-Gon- Okay, his text can’t be canceled. Yes!!!! He’ll never lose that immunity again! (not) The lightsaber combat stuff is good. Best part is the lightsaber go fetch text. A good card as well.<br>
<br>
Jabba- Hate it. Not a version I think I’ll play with. Too limited and too weak. You have to play an entire deck themed around him to be worth it and that would be a weak deck indeed. Next.<br>
<br>
Bib Fortuna- See Jabba.<br>
<br>
Leia, Rebel Princess- Yeah! Metal swimwear Leia! She kills drains with retrieval?! She neuters aliens, She can swing the ol’ saber and wear the armor of Boushh. Well, also added immunity to attrition ( &lt;5 with Han or Luke.) Wait, could it be. A main with a destiny 3? Very nice.<br>
<br>
Lando- This guy is just sic!! He’s stronger than Vader! What the heck?! Adds obscene destiny to his power. I hated Lando before and now I despise the super Lando under principle. P.S. he’s a good card. SHHH… don’t tell anyone that I said that, Okay?<br>
<br>
Obi-Wan- It’s about time. His added immunities are great and the fact we finally see the 6/6 jedi is awesome. Great card.<br>
<br>
Well now that I’ve talked about some of the crap I wanted to I’m happy. I know that I didn’t talk about some of the other stuff, but I will in my next article some time in  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
