I will tell you how a bunch of us got better as players, but it tells a more important tale.  It might be too long for some of you, so don&#146;t bother if you are gonna just give a lousy rating because it doesn&#146;t give some all-powerful tech.<br>

3 years ago I met Ray Bordier and Joe Young while travelling to the armpit of Pennsylvania known as Downingtown.  This was also the home store for a few guys that also have done well in the game...(Eric Slawko, James Leiser, TJ Holman)  Ray kept bugging me to swap emails and it began from there.  A few months later we formed the &quot;Death Squadron.&quot;	Joe Young&#146;s beat up old Merc Sable was our transport (we almost died many times with Joe at the wheel.. it was a dark, wet, foggy night outside of Williamsport, PA)  We would go to tournaments all over eastern PA and NJ and usually come in 1,2, and 4 every single time (2 guys undefeated, one with 1 loss at the hand of another).	We would share deck ideas, playtest, playtest some more.  These guys learned how to handle serious insert decks at my hands.<br>
<br>
In the spring and summer of 1998, Chris Praskac and Ray&#146;s brother Dan joined our crew.  Team Neon (Slawko, Holman, and Leiser) also became a force, and we made connections with a few guys we all know and love:	Hak, Wojciech, Marco, Lolli and Lingrell.  Nathan Brown and his little green Neon (rest in peace) and camera showed up at everything.  That was the beginning of Coruscant becoming a force in the SWCCG world.  Holman and Wojciech dueling at DragonCon. Most of the guys going to Origins.  Our first lesson about the nature of the beast was at the Rochester Coruscant Regional.	We had our first encounter with Team Albany there and finally met the mysterious Marco Habert, but when a questionable situation between Chris Praskac and our host exploded into a TD nightmare, we knew it was the end of the innocence.  Basically Chris fell victim to the hunger of victory.  He was 4-0 and paired with our host.  The winner would end up at the top table for the last game, then possibly on to the final confrontation.  Chris handed our host his deck to count and he said they were all there. After the game Chris found 12 more cards in his deck box, thus questioning the motive of our host.	Hak ended up winning that tourney, but it left a sour taste in our mouths.<br>
<br>
Later that year came worldwide fame for some, DecipherCon, Operatives, sudden quick victory with lousy cards, and a sense of uncertainty with the state of the game.  Yeah, the next year we all did Origins and some did DragonCon and GenCon too, but the team began to go separate ways.  The Ghetto Squad guys brought a newfound sense of comraderie and silliness, but even that became too questionable.  We still got together to see movies or hang out,  but SWCCG lost its status with us.  Add to that ongoing broken and/or uncompatable strategies, well it became who would out-cheese whom.  Another round of DecipherCon, Ghetto Controversies of 2000, more conventions, it kept going on... until this week.<br>
<br>
Joe Young (all 684 posted tournament games) announced his retirement from the game to go back to school.  Yesterday Ray Bordier became a dad.  A chapter of my life, and the lives of my close friends, has come to a close.  I don&#146;t know what the future of SWCCG has for me.  I know I will continue to run tournaments and play for a while.  I know that until we got &quot;the taste of victory,&quot;  we were just innocently having a good time.	I don&#146;t blame Ray for wanting to be among the best, as that is his right to dream.  I know the only reason Joe played more games than me is that 101 of his games were at tournaments I ran.  I will miss that &quot;age of innocence&quot; we once had, and I look forward to the new future we have.<br>
<br>
We got better at this game because we immersed ourselves in the community.  Ray the constant shmoozer, clown, prick (depending on what his goal was), Joe the dedicated gamer, playing game 6 at Origins 1999 after a &quot;heavy&quot; trip to the bar, and me, the wannabe king of TD&#146;s.  We played and talked and played and bashed each other and played some more.  One of my fondest memories was beating Ray in a tournament game to go into the final game and win the thing.  I jumped on the table and yelled, &quot;kiss my @$$, Bordier!!  I got you!!!.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of you are gonna read this and bash it for not giving you the secret of life or some other really cool Tech.  If you can&#146;t figure it out that the answer is in here, then the number of stars you give this is probably equal to your IQ or your penis size in millimeters.<br>
<br>
To all the friends I made and will make at future events, thanks for a good time!!<br>
