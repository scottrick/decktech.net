<br>
I think bounty hunter decks can not only be powerful beat downs but also a lot of fun to play. Now more then ever with all the great cards involeing bounty hunters. Ok so after Jabba&#146;s Palace I have to say I tought Bounty huntting had pecked. There were bounties,all wrapped up and a few other cards that helped you capture and retrive force.<br>
<br>
Now with all the e1 stuff out bounty huntting has become even better. I&#146;ll be talking a lot about some of my favorite bounty hunters and cards to with them from this point on so if you want to know what I think this is your only warnning. Ok here is the best way I think to run it on cloud city. There you have the interagation room with the interagation array. powerful force drains as soon as you capture a main. Because you got the force drain for 2 then the interagation array for 2 more that a total of 4 plus any bonuses for people and the lightsabers. Now combine that with force regain from the bounties and it will be diffacult for your opponant to beat you. <br>
<br>
Ok on to some of my favorite bounty hunters. If you play vs. a profit deck at all Boba Fett bounty hunter and Snoova are a must to have in your deck. power 13,3battle destinies and a 4&amp;5 for the armor each. These guys aren&#146;t just good vs. profit Snoova can pull a vibro-ax from your deck and capture people when he hits them with it. Boba fett can use hidden wepons wicth isn&#146;t to bad if you know how to track decently you should be able to capture or instently kill a character. then if at the end of a battle you can use all wrapped up on them leaveing that site your for the take next turn. I can&#146;t forget about Bossek w/motorgun every one has ones and twos in their deck and with bounties on the table it should be easy to capture some one with him.<br>
<br>
Also some of the bounty hunter related cards are high destinies as well. And as we all know when playing a deck that&#146;s not bad tto have.<br>
