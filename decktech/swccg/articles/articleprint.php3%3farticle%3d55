An example of this would be the difference between a good revo deck and a bad one. While some good players might debate over the usage of destiny adders vs. counter cards, none would suggest that the deck would be better	suited with a couple copies of rebel troopers or a 'theyre on dantooine' and a few copies of dantooine. This, in a very rudimentary form, is the essence of efficiency at the deckbuilding level. You try not to use cards that wont work in a variety of situations, and attempt to limit the number of multiples of cards you DO choose use to numbers conducive to both the amount of times you plan on using the cards during the course of the game, and the frequency and speed with which you would like to draw them into your hand. This balance is the subject for debate between a lot of different players, and is influenced by a number of factors including playstyle and the metagame you currently face. This is one of the fundamental principals of deckbuilding, and can be justified using the logic that if i dont include cards i wont use, and i dont include useless multiples of cards, and my deck will be better for not including them, then my deck will be better the more 'efficient' it becomes.<br>
<br>
The First Principal of Efficiency: The Metagame<br>
<br>
This principal is fairly easy to understand. In its most basic form, it says, dont include cards in your deck design that dont either help your deck in its objectives (your deck must always have an objective. Well get to that later) or directly counter or at least significantly hinder an opposing deck that theoretically will give you trouble in a matchup (an example of this would be putting a battle order/plan into your deck against operatives or ISB). This is to say that you should not put cards (or side strategies) that do not directly benefit you or hinder you opponent. An example of a violation of this principal would be to put several (or even just one) copies of the LS vine snake equivalent into your MWYHL train to 5 deck because they dont directly benefit your objective (training and battling) and they do not significantly hinder any strategy that your opponent is likely to play. However, including battle plan, Wars not make one great, and possibly a couple surprise assaults in your deck are differeny because they all significantly hinder opposing strategies (BP slows down the opposing deck as does WNMOG, and surprise assauly hurts spread weenies, all of which are fairly likely to be played). This is the fundamental principal and the direct effect of what many players call metagaming.<br>
<br>
The Second Principal: Goal Orientation<br>
<br>
Every card in a SWCCG deck should be aimed at either accomplishing, or adding to another cards attempt to accomplish a goal. The cards from the first fundamental principal are included here because they accomplish the goal of either hindering your opponent or aiding a strategy of your own. This differs from the first principal in that your deck needs to have a cohesive strategy to win, and it needs the ability to accomplish that strategy by playing cards condusive to it. For example, lets take a drazin manipulator for a second. Its strategy seems to be to accomplish as many special deliveries as possible while scanning crew and force draining your opponent to death. However, these break down into two rough categories of deckbuilding that could be termed damage and disruption. Every good deck includes both principals in some form or another. Even pre errata ops had disruption in bright center and the force drain -1 provided in the objective, as well as retreival. Retrieval is a form of disruption because, by definition, you are disrupting your opponents damage to you by placing it back in your life force. Other forms of disruption (like revolutions and scanning crews and Battle Plan) focus on disrupting the mechanisms by which your opponent attempts to either damage or disrupt your strategy. It is in this principal that the system of counter strategies and contingencies present in high level matches takes shape. This is all to say that every card in your deck should be focused on either damaging or disrupting your opponent (disruption can include the removal of your opponents characters, as in evazan or  adders), and that all of the strategies present in your deck design should contribute to the same (note that battling is a form of disruption and not damage, and that it is only on rare occasions where your opponent is either unprepared or otherwise unlucky or outplayed that battling generally becomes an efficient method of dealing damage. The legwork is nearly always done by either direct (force draining) or indirect (numbers, civil disorder) methods, and that even battle oriented decks seek to gain control of a few locations and force drain and use their ability to battle to disrupt the opponents strategy sufficiently to allow them to do so). An exapmle of the opposite of this principal would be to create a deck with an obiwans hut and 59 rebel troopers; it cannot deal damage sufficiently on its own; all of its cards are dedicated to disruption, and while certainly effective agaist some weaker character decks, would definitely fall short against more balanced or system based force draining due to the lack of the ability to deal damage effectively. Ok, so this principal states two things: that your deck must include cards only either intended to damage or disrupt your opponent (prefferably disrupt strategies your deck would otherwise be weak against), and second, that your deck should include both disruption and damage dealing cards.<br>
<br>
The Third Principal: Deck Choice<br>
<br>
Deck choice as a function of the efficiency of your deck can be seen in two ways. The first and easiest way to understand would be from the metagame level. If your deck, by the simple choice of strategy, beats or is strong against a number of other decks, it logically would have to include fewer counter cards (referencing principal one because they would be useless because your deck already counters them), and thus would be able to include either more cards related to either damaging or disrupting your opponent, increasing the likelihood that these objectives would be successful. an example of this principal would be operatives, who easily counter (in theory) most decks due to their innate ability to disrupt their opponent (force drain -1, add a destiny) by accomplishing their damage goals (spreading out to multiple sites to force drain). So this allows the operative deck to more narrowly focus its disruption and damage goals without sacrificing space to useless counter cards which gives the deck some greater amount of flexibility in a sense (its cards are never 'useless' until they themselves become the subject of disruption). The second way to see this principal is on the deckbuilding level. If i choose a strategy that requires a large number of cards to play, it follows that the number of card slots dedicated to disruption or damage would then be reduced (this is tricky because presumably your strategy involves elements of one or both). A red flag is likely when any single strategy requires 30 or more cards to make it run effectively with no overlap between it and other strategies. This is the weakness of MWYHL surprise assault destiny 7 decks. They attempt to get around this by finding multiple uses of destiny 7s (like training and EPPs) , but between the surprise assaults, and destiny 7s, often 25 cards are used for one strategy with little or no overlap, which causes them to be deficient in other forms of damage dealing (liek force draining) due to their inability to effectively include adequate cards for that purpose, thus hindering thier ability to deal 'real' damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are just a few of the principals of efficiency in deck design, and further elaborations on these principals will make up the substance of later articles.<br>
