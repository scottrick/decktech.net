For the rest of you, this is the first in a series of in-depth articles I'm writing on various Court decks. I will examine possible strengths and weaknesses of cards to include in each of the types, and provide combos and sample deck play through the first few turns.<br>
<br>
THE DECK : Bounty Hunters Unite!<br>
<br>
The basic premise of this type of deck is to capitalize on the early force advantage and pro-interaction elements of the objective in order to battle the opponent to death. It will rarely if ever flip to the 7-side of the objective, preferring instead to keep the forfeit and deploy bonus for Hunters and to force the opponent to lose force if they don't want to fight.<br>
<br>
PART ONE: BUILDING THE DECK<br>
<br>
LOCATIONS:<br>
<br>
You'll need to include the Audience Chamber, Dungeon, and Great Pit of Carkoon in order to play the objective. Other locations to include depend on whether you want to focus the deck on force generation, mobility, or drains.<br>
<br>
The best ways to get generation quickly are to include all the other Jabba's Palace sites and multiple copies of Tatooine: Jabba's Palace, which lets you search for them. This method also allows you one of the best channeling (forcing your opponent to deploy where you want them to) strategies in the game: None Shall Pass. This method, however, relies heavily upon one location, and can be too slow if you don't get a T: JP in the first couple of hands.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you could take advantage of the the objective and use multiple docking bays, which you can deploy from the Reserve Deck. The Executor and Coruscant bays both are 1/0 sites and difficult for the LS player to get to, while generic docking bays and other planetary ones allow you to come chase the opponent. The main advantages to this approach are extreme mobility and the ability to get the sites from Reserve in the beginning of the game. Disadvantages include requiring many sites to get a decent activation going and all those 0 destinies.<br>
<br>
If your goal is to drain the opponent, the best sites to use are the Cantina, Jundland Wastes, Lars' Moisture Farm, and Tusken Canyon. Each of them provide you with a drain of two. The main disadvantage to going this route is that none of those sites are 'secure', meaning that the opponent is free to deploy there and battle you.<br>
<br>
An alternate drain method is to use Gailid to increase your drains at Jabba's Palace sites by 1. With all 6 JP sites out, that's a total drain of 8 without any other modifiers; not too shabby. An upside to this method is that the opponent can only deploy to 2 of your drain sites without a spy, and both of those can be protected by None Shall Pass. The main disadvantage is that any card that reduces your drains or removes your drain modifiers will reduce your total drain to 2.<br>
<br>
For mobility, the best sites to use are docking bays. Lots of docking bays. Grab them from the deck for force activation and to allow you to chase to whatever planet the opponent wants to play on.<br>
<br>
If you want to include any space in the deck, the best to use are the Tatooine system (for extra power in Tatooine battles and for the possibility of an Occupation), and Kiffex, Kashyyyk, and Endor for drains. If you prefer to reduce your opponent's drains off your systems, go for Corulag, Nal Hutta, or Endor.<br>
<br>
One last way to use locations is to trap your opponent and give him few good battleground choices. Tatooine: Desert, Krayt Dragon Pass, and the Jundland Wastes all present good choices for this path.<br>
<br>
STARSHIPS:<br>
<br>
With this deck, you will usually only want to prevent your opponent from dominating in space, or make the occasional drain. A serious commitment to space will weaken your character base or reduce the number of supporting Interrupts and Effects you can include in the deck.<br>
<br>
One way to work space is to use Independent starships because you can get them from Reserve Deck if needed. Any of the Bounty Hunters in their respective ships are powerful forces in space (either as two separate cards - a forgotten art these days - or in the SE / ECC / EJP versions that are 2-in-1 deals). The Slave 1 is the most powerful (as in the statistic, Power) Starfighter in the game!<br>
<br>
If, however, you don't want to tie up your Hunters in space, there are still ways to make space work for you. Two possible options are to include Outer Rim Scouts and the Dagobah Independent starships (card intensive but powerful), or to include low-deploy Dreadnaughts (which, unfortunately, won't work with Scum and Villainy).<br>
<br>
VEHICLES:<br>
<br>
There are two different vehicle strategies, which are equally viable. The first is to sacrifice Scum compatibility in favor of power and immunity by using AT-AT's and related cards. The second method is to use lower-power (if higher destiny) vehicles that won't disallow Scum, for instance Skiffs, Speeder Bikes, and Swoops.<br>
<br>
Walkers are very powerful cards, and can provide a strong presence on the ground. Their immunity to attrition helps protect characters; Blizzard 2, Tempest 1, and most of the unique AT-STs have permanent pilots; and they can make movement simple with their large cargo capacity. On the other hand, they are expensive to deploy and will rule out Scum and Villainy from your deck plan (as you can see, this card marks a division between two different styles of play; more later). Also, their Landspeed is the same as walking (and worse than Fett, Kast, or a Jet Pack-ed character flying), and they are all enclosed, meaning that characters inside cannot add their power to the battle (although the are protected for outside influences).<br>
<br>
Skiffs and other, unpiloted vehicles tend to be less powerful but cheaper than the Walkers. They also have generally higher landspeed and are open, which allows several powerful characters to move large distances at a time. The openness is also a drawback, however; the characters on the vehicle are not protected from weapons fire, Effects such as Disarmed, Interrupts like Clash of Sabers, or the environment (Sandstorm). many of this category of vehicles allow you to 'react' over a wide range of sites (Skiffs and Speeder Bikes in particular), letting you spread a little thinner across the planet.<br>
<br>
WEAPONS:<br>
<br>
Mostly you'll want to include the weapons that will cause the most harm to the opponent's strategy. Repeating weapons like Bob Fett's Blaster Rifle, Light Repeating Blaster Rifle, and the Antipersonnel Cannon, can hit multiple characters in a battle, creating good card efficiency. Mara Jade's Lightsaber, Vader's Lightsaber, and Dark Jedi Lightsabers provide drain bonuses and let you hit characters much easier.<br>
<br>
Capture weapons, like Dengar's Modified Riot Gun, Feltipern Trevagg's Stun Rifle, and Zuckuss's Snare Rifle, still can be useful, even if you don't intend to capture anyone; According to recent rulings, any character successfully hit by one of these weapons (or IG-88's built-in riot gun) may be sent to the Light Side player's Used Pile instead of being taken into custody. This is extremely powerful! You can pick off characters like Chewbacca and remove them from battle; possibly from the whole game if you get lucky and the opponent has trouble finding him again.<br>
<br>
DEVICES:<br>
<br>
Most likely you won't want to use many devices, but there are still some worthy of thought. Jet Packs give characters the ability to participate in battles over a 7-site range (!!), and Mandalorian Armor gives a measure of protection to any character (except Fett or Vader), as well as allowing the use of Hidden Weapons in battle. Caller and Restraining Bolt are high-destiny devices that can zap that Gifted Artoo over to your side, possibly setting up for a 10-force Torture.<br>
<br>
EFFECTS AND INTERRUPTS:<br>
<br>
These two will be the most variable and personal in your deck. Both depend heavily upon your style of play and on how finely focused your deck is on the various aspects of play. As such, I will provide some general guidelines of the type of Effects and Interrupts that work well with different focuses, and give sample Combos at the end of the article. This may sound a tad like a laundry list, but Ill try to provide rationale for each. Besides, fully explaining each and every possible effect would take a month and be a waste of time anyway.<br>
<br>
Some (by no means all!) good offensive Effects are Scum And Villainy (reduces deploy), Search And Destroy and Ability Ability Ability (cause direct damage to opponent if they don't want to deploy), Tatooine Occupation (causes large amounts of damage if you control Tatooine), and Lateral Damage for space.<br>
<br>
Offensive Interrupts include, but are not limited to, Vader's Obsession (which can also be used by Mara Jade!) and The Circle Is Now Complete (both allow you to duel key Light Side characters away), Hidden Weapons and You Are Beaten (more character removal), Wounded Wookie (eliminates nasty gametext or certain destiny draws), and Elis Helrot (rapid character movement).<br>
<br>
Defensive Effects include Bargaining Table (canceling drains), Secret Plans (to hurt Light Side retrieval), Oppressive Enforcement  and There Is No Try (stops opponents Sense and Alter from raining on your parade), Imperial Decree (to stop / reduce opponents drains and Revolutions), Crush The Rebellion (to stop Clash of Sabers),  Imperial Arrest Order to reduce the overall mobility of the game, and Battle Order to slow the game down by forcing players to pay for drains (be careful to maintain a balanced deck if you include this, it can backfire on you!).<br>
<br>
Among the good defensive Interrupts are: Projective Telepathy (slow down drains and battles), None Shall Pass (an important defense that will be discussed in depth a little later), Ghhhk (no battle damage for me!), Imperial Barrier (another good character-stopper), and Sense , Alter and Control (ways to keep opponents cards in line and cancel drains).<br>
<br>
Other Effects and Interrupts to look at are TwiLek Advisor to grab important effects from the Reserve Deck, Careful Planning and Any Means Necessary to activate more Force, Tarkins Orders (cancels many popular Light Side Interrupts), Monnok to get rid of annoying doubles, Reactor Terminal (always useful), Blast Door Controls (cancels two very popular LS Interrupts, Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier), and Security Precautions and Broken Concentration (to counteract Hidden Base and Mind What You Have Learned, respectively).<br>
<br>
CHARACTERS:<br>
<br>
This is the meat-and-potatoes of the Bounty Hunters Unite! style of deck. You will likely want to include as many as 20 or 25 characters in the deck, since they will be battling and draining at multiple sites.<br>
<br>
Bounty Hunters are, of course, the power characters in the deck. Zuckuss, Bane Malar, Djas Puhr, and IG-88 with Riot Gun can all draw destiny on their own. IG-88, Boba Fett, Dengar, and Bossk all have good power. There are quite a few Hunters with useful special abilities and/or weapons. Boba Fett with Blaster, IG-88 with Riot Gun, and 4-LOM with Rifle all add destinies under certain circumstances. Bane Malar can copy an important LS character in a battle (good candidates include Chewie, Han, or even Lando), often giving you a nice power boost and an extra destiny if youre lucky. Jodo Kast can cancel an opponent's destiny draw if they draw more than one. Feltipern Trevagg can make it expensive for your opponent to battle (watch out for Battle Plan, though! It allows the Light Side to initiate for free!) and has a nice matching weapon that can send characters back to the Used Pile.<br>
<br>
Non-Hunters also have their place in a Bounty Hunter deck. Jabba is almost always a good choice (either version: JP Jabba increases all your aliens' forfeit and allows you to activate more, while SE Jabba adds forfeit only to non-unique aliens but makes your deploy cheaper to his location). Boelo can cancel a destiny in certain situations. Chall Bekan lets you get a non-unique into hand and makes your deploy cheaper over a 3-site range. Kithaba can become extremely powerful against a Mains deck, but is a prime target for Master Luke's bouncer. Mara Jade is still an alien for Scum and Villainy, and has a matching saber, immunity to attrition, and high ability, making her a natural inclusion (keep her out of the Palace, however, if you want to play None Shall Pass.).<br>
<br>
If you don't mind not being able to use Scum and Villainy, there's really no reason you can't play with your favorite Imperials right alongside Fett and crew. Vader, Tarkin, Ozzel, Veers, Igar, all can become powerful additions.<br>
<br>
Another possible route to take is to include only a (relative) few of the above characters, and include a posse of non-unique aliens. Good ones to include are Abyssins (regeneration ability), Outer Rim Scouts (pilots and good all-round), Nikto (high power/forfeit inside the Palace), or Skrillings (high destiny and can be cheap and powerful). If you go this route, be sure to include supporting interrupts like Abyssin Ornament, and to include several copies of the matching Representative, if any (Myo for Abyssins and Pote Snitkin for Skrillings; Nikto and ORS have no Rep). Disadvantages to this playstyle include reliance on the Audience Chamber and vulnerability to Grimtaash. Advantages include being able to use several good support cards and being able to deploy lots of power for little expense of Force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CREATURES:<br>
<br>
You most likely wont include any creatures (since you wont aim to flip), but Bubo is always nice to eat stray characters or gobble Han if he gets released from a Profit deck.<br>
<br>
PART TWO: PLAYING THE DECK<br>
<br>
So, youve got your Bounty Hunters Unite! deck built... now what? Well, almost every version of this type of Court of the Vile Gangster deck will play in the same manner, albeit through different means.<br>
<br>
The main focus of this deck is to lure your opponent to Tatooine, where you can pick your battle carefully and drop down a squad of characters to cause large amounts of damage in one battle. The objective helps you do this in two ways: One, it makes your opponent lose one force each turn if they arent one Tatooine, and Two, it beefs up your Bounty Hunters to where they can withstand more than one battle.<br>
<br>
Mostly you will go about doing this by draining them until they cant stand it anymore. Eat the ensuing battle damage, Ghhhk it, or keep them from battling by playing interrupts like Rebel Barrier or None Shall Pass. None Shall Pass is extremely valuable for 3 reasons: it sends Rebels back to the opponents hand, it is Used, and it is destiny 5. Its drawbacks are that it requires large numbers to be really effective, it is not immune to Sense, and it only works at Jabbas Palace sites (and then only if no Imperials are at Jabbas Palace sites); still, NSP is one of the very best table control cards in the game.<br>
<br>
After theyve committed their forces, its time to pay the Rebels a visit. Using cheaper deploy from cards like Scum and Villainy (which also lets you retrieve force, but limits you to using Aliens only), Chall Bekan, and Special Edition Jabba, deploy a beatdown squad to battle whatever pitiful force remains. Alternatively, just go the Big Blue route and smack the opponent with walkers and Trample their forces to reasonable levels, then attack.<br>
<br>
If just drains and the Objective arent incentive enough to rumble, try playing Tatooine Occupation and seeing how they like that. The extra 3 to 5 (or more!) force a turn may change their minds. On the other hand, it does commit you to space, and you run the risk of incurring the wrath of the Super Falcon (Millennium Falcon + Captain Han + EPP Leia; 7 power, immunity to &lt;5, and 3 destinies. Ouch.).<br>
<br>
There are really 2 main divisions to this deck, as I mentioned earlier. The split is based around the tradeoff required by Scum and Villainy between A) high power, and B) cheaper deploy combined with decent retrieval.  The way you decide to play it is entirely a matter of personal preference; both methods are equally viable, and both are equally easy to make.<br>
<br>
If you choose not to use S&amp;V, you gain the use of Vader and his cronies, as well as the Imperial Armys AT-ATs and AT-STs and the Navys ISDs and Dreadnaughts. These are all very powerful cards in their own right; combined with this objective and the high-forfeit Hunters it creates, you have a force with incredible staying power.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Scum provides game-wide benefits to the Dark Side, with all your aliens and starships deploying -1 and with the ability to retrieve 2 extra force every time you initiate a battle. The tradeoff comes in that you lose the services of Vader et al.; not something to shrug off lightly.<br>
<br>
PART THREE: COMBOS<br>
<br>
Court + Zuckuss in Mist Hunter + Bossk in Hounds Tooth = use the objective to pull the ships out of your deck and deploy them for 11 power, 2 destiny draws, and the ability to reduce your opponents draws to 0 if they dont have at least 7 ability. Add in IG-88 in IG-2000 and 4-LOM (either version) for more fun all around.<br>
<br>
Court + Jabba The Hutt + Scum and Villainy + Cloud City Boba Fett = 4 deploy, 4 power, 3 ability, and *9* forfeit... thats more than Vader! Plus, hes hard to hit and has some immunity to attrition!<br>
<br>
Zuckuss + Jet Pack = Ill react, for free, with a landspeed = 3. Give him a good weapon, and nuff said.<br>
<br>
Mara Jade + Mara Jades Lightsaber (or Dark Jedi Lightsaber) + Vaders Obsession + Focused Attack = Luke? What Luke? I dont see Luke here... AKA: ( in best Palpatine voice) YOU WILL KILL LUKE SKYWALKER!<br>
<br>
Vader + His Saber + Obsession or Circle Is Now Complete = No Jedi for you! Yes, this is completely legal in this deck, WITHOUT Epic Duel... with the current amount of Hunt Down decks floating around, may catch quite a few people off-guard.<br>
<br>
Vader + Tarkin + a battle + Weapon Levitation + duel = absolutely no chance for them to win this one.<br>
<br>
Jabbas Space Yacht + Jabba + Boelo + 4-LOM w/ gun + EPP Fett + another pilot = lots of power, 3 destiny, cancels an opponents destiny, moves for free, and ... oh yeah ... completely immune to attrition. Nice, if card-intensive. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
