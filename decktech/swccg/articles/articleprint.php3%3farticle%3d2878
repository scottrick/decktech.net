<br>
	I&#146;ve wanted to write a fiction for Decktech and the SWCCG community for some now.  I&#146;ve written a lot on here as far as tournament reports go, but I haven&#146;t written any fiction at all (aside from the many, many hyperboles included in said TRs).  Since what I do on my own time is fiction writing, I feel like writing a fiction, and I feel like writing it about the game we all play, or at least try to.<br>
<br>
	Keeping with technical and explanatory notes, I&#146;m writing this on WORD, but will copy to NOTEPAD, which is my friend, and I&#146;m truly hoping I wont get any of those weird codes when I use quotations, because fiction has dialogue, and if that happens I&#146;m going to be angry.  Hopefully Neal or Matt will delete it for me so I can repost&amp;#8230;or maybe if their smart they&#146;ll delete this garbage anyway.<br>
<br>
	In actuality, this piece is not going to be garbage at all.  I&#146;m not even going to use real people from the game as characters, not even the people I slander!  Everything in the story to follow is entirely fictional. <br>
	<br>
	The only non-fiction element is the game and worlds.  Since many of us are in anticipation of DCON, I wanted to write a story about some players and their long, long trip to worlds.  There&#146;ll be plot twists, deception, maybe some romance or something, I really don&#146;t know.  Either way I hope you enjoy, and remember&amp;#8230; it&#146;s ALL fiction.<br>
<br>
	One more thing, this chapter is kind of long because its introductory, there is a lot to be explained (especially the end of the chapter) so give it time, you will enjoy it, I promise.<br>
<br>
Chapter I <br>
Which Way is East?<br>
<br>
	For the first time in a long time, the two boys walking across a St. Paul cemetery at 9 a.m. didn&#146;t feel like StarWars nerds, they didn&#146;t feel like boys either; they were men now, and they looked like men.  Aside from the frozen grass cracking under their feet, they walked in silence, heads down, you could barely tell they were breathing if not for the cold steam of breath escaping them every few seconds.  <br>
They had just buried their closest friend Walter Price, and they weren&#146;t even nineteen yet.<br>
	Minutes later they reached the curb, and the van that the three had often traveled hundreds of miles at a time in; a beige &#146;84 VW van they affectionately called the Huttese Falcon.  Bobby, the shorter of the two, and by far the heavier, finally spoke, &quot;I almost don&#146;t want to go.&quot;<br>
	Walt, Bobby and Alex, the taller and thinner of the two, had eaten at the same diner every Sunday morning for almost four years now.  For the last two, their friend and the local Tournament Director had joined them, his name was Brian Johnson, but they never called him that.  In fact, none of them called each other by their real names.<br>
	<br>
Even though they didn&#146;t feel like it at the moment, they were Starwars nerds.  They&#146;d seen the movie hundreds of times, they played the card game, Alex has a stormtrooper helmet from the original film.  They were geeks.  Walt had gotten them both into the card game almost five years ago.  They were 14, they weren&#146;t cool (even though Alex thought he was) and they played Magic.  Craving something new, they tried the SWCCG, fell in love with it, and now played every weekend for as long as they can remember, less this tragic weekend.  <br>
	Bobby Ira Buchanon was perhaps the biggest geek of them all.  He had a tendency to rename his friends, family, and obviously his car, after characters and objects from the Starwars universe.  As per his initials, he called himself (mostly online) Bib.  Bearing no resemblance to Mr. Fortuna, Bib was about 5&#146;8&quot; and weight 218 lbs.  He was usually clad in black jeans, a black t-shirt with a flannel button down over that.  He preferred his green flannel to the blue and the red, but it&#146;s hard to live off of three shirts.  Needful to say that Bib wasn&#146;t the best looking guy on the face of the earth, he still wasn&#146;t so bad looking that he never had a girlfriend, he just didn&#146;t have one at the time&amp;#8230; who lived within 500 miles.<br>
	Alex Springwell was an almost polar opposite to Bib physically.  Mentally though, Alex thought he was ten times better than anyone at anything, and often times he was.  Alex stood 6&#146;1&quot; weighed only 185lbs., and actually had a sense of fashion that his companion lacked.  He wasn&#146;t the best looking kid out there, but the thought he was, and the half decent looking girls he got only fuelled his ego.  Alex thought he was a funny kid, sometimes he was; he had a sharp wit, but he usually ended up saying the gayest things in attempts to impress people.  Couple this with his savvy clothes; Bib and just about everyone else in the SWCCG community knew him as Gaylid (after Galid).  <br>
	<br>
Gaylid and Bib stepped out of the Falcon and stopped before walking into the Diner they (and not surprisingly so) referred to as the &quot;Cantina.&quot;  This time Gaylid spoke up for the first time in almost two hours, &quot;It&#146;s really not the same without the sliding door clanging shut&quot;<br>
	&quot;I know.&quot; Bib replied, &quot;Dude, nothings gonna be the same for a long time.  Maybe not even at all who knows&amp;#8230; you think He&#146;s in there already?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Probably, I think he feels bad he didn&#146;t go to the funeral OR the wake.  He thinks he let the Price&#146;s down by not going, they understood though, right?&quot;<br>
	&quot;I guess so.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	As they entered the Cantina, Brian Johnson was already at their usual table, his usual seat, &quot;What&#146;s up Ted Danson?&quot; Gaylid called out from the doorway.  <br>
&quot;Good one&quot; came from Bib as they headed for the table.&quot;<br>
	Brian Johnson had been the Tournament Director in the area since he moved to St. Paul from Topeka.  They never called him by his real name, sometimes he questioned whether or not his two friends knew it.  They called him a dozen different names on any given day they saw him, all the names had the initials T.D.<br>
	As they sat down, Timothy Dalton was already asking them about the funeral, 	&quot;Hey guys, sorry I wasn&#146;t there, you know how I am with that kinda thing, how&#146;d it go?&quot;<br>
	&quot;It was okay&quot; Gaylid replied, &quot;It&#146;s still pretty rough but I guess it&#146;s starting to sink in.&quot;<br>
<br>
	Then the waitress, the same waitress they&#146;d had for going on two years this Christmas, came over with out menus or a notepad.  &quot;Hey, where&#146;s your buddy?&quot;<br>
Of course, Walt had been with them every Sunday since she&#146;d started, but she didn&#146;t know his real name, only his Starwars one (even though she had no clue what it meant).  She didn&#146;t know he had died either.<br>
	Six days ago, Walt, who Bib and Gaylid called ReeYees, in part due to the fact they needed a cool Jabba&#146;s Palace alien to stick to the motif, but mainly because at the time they were making up the names, Walt had a giant zit on his forehead, just off center to the left.<br>
	Taylor Dayne, being the oldest by at least four years, decided to step up and field this one.  Gaylid didn&#146;t want to listen to the story again; he headed for the bathroom.  Tom Daschel swallowed, and dropped the bomb on May, &quot;Well, you heard about that kid who killed his step-father, step-brother and himself?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Oh my God that wasn&#146;t him was it?  It couldn&#146;t have been.&quot;<br>
	&quot;No, it wasn&#146;t him.  But he was the step-brother,&quot; Tony Dorsett could barely muster the words.<br>
	&quot;Wow, guys I&#146;m really sorry to hear that.  He was a real sweet kid.&quot;<br>
	&quot;Thanks&quot; T.D. and Bib replied simultaneously.  They&#146;d grown used to the sad reply over the past few days.<br>
	&quot;We know.&quot; Came a voice from behind May, Gaylid was back.<br>
	<br>
Gaylid and May didn&#146;t get along, mainly because she originally thought he was gay, despite his always trying to hit on her.  Gaylid, never responding to the accusations of homosexuality, tried even harder to land her, and to no avail, which inflamed him even more so.<br>
Gaylid sat down as May said she&#146;d bring them their usual meals, but they all wanted what ReeYees usually got, grilled cheese with fries smothered in bacon and cheese, and they wanted four; one for him.  The empty seat facing the window was all of a sudden very present to the three.  They all stared at it for a long time.  Neither of them noticed May bring them their drinks (actually, the drink that ReeYees always got), nor did they realize that they were all sitting in silence, looking at the chair that had always been filled by their friend.  They didn&#146;t even notice the grilled cheeses on their table until May came over to remind them that she&#146;d dropped them off.<br>
	<br>
	After almost 15 minutes of eating in silence, Gaylid wiped his mouth and spoke, &quot;So, Tyler Durden, we&#146;ve decided to drive to Dcon.  We&#146;re going to leave tomorrow.  You sure you cannot come at all?&quot;<br>
	&quot;You&#146;re driving? Are you nuts? What about school?&quot; He replied.<br>
	&quot;Well we&#146;re not going to be in school this week anyways because of&amp;#8230; this&amp;#8230; and we didn&#146;t want to fly because of what happened last month.&quot; Bib interjected.<br>
	&quot;It&#146;s going to be like our last big roadtrip.  Like a way to say goodbye to Ree, the way I guess it&#146;s easier for us.&quot; Gaylid added.<br>
Tim Duncan finished chewing on a fry, &quot;You know I couldn&#146;t go before, I can&#146;t now very well take a week off of work to go.  You guys have my cards, the decks; you&#146;ll be fine.  You&#146;ll do well&amp;#8230; Gaylid&amp;#8230;&quot;<br>
This is the first time anyone had called him Gaylid all day.  Gaylid shot Trent Dilfer. his patented death stare as he despised being called by that name.  Even though everyone referred to him as Gaylid, very rarely did they say it to his face.<br>
	&quot;Alex,&quot; Tony Danza continued, &quot;you&#146;ll qualify.&quot;<br>
	Gaylid qualified last year for day two, but he hasn&#146;t played that well in recent months.  Bib beat him out for the Minnesota state championship, and didn&#146;t have to worry about the sea of jizz that is day one of worlds.<br>
	&quot;I dunno, I don&#146;t wanna talk about it right now.  It&#146;s not the most important thing on my mind&amp;#8230;I&#146;m really not hungry, lets get out of here so we can start getting ready to go.  We&#146;ve got a lot of play-testing and packing to do tonight.&quot;  Gaylid replied as he got up and signaled May over.<br>
	&quot;Yes SIR, what can I do for you?&quot; May said sarcastically.<br>
	&quot;We&#146;re all set&quot; Bib said, before Gaylid could answer her.<br>
	&quot;Well this one is on me today guys, you just have fun on your little trip and, ill see you in a couple a weeks, k?&quot; May said with a smile.<br>
	&quot;We&#146;ll still give you a tip though.&quot; Gaylid said, trying to be macho.<br>
	&quot;You are &lt;b&gt;SO&lt;/b&gt; gay&quot; Bib said, destroying Gaylid&#146;s ego for at least a few seconds.<br>
	The smile vanished from May&#146;s face and she put her left hand on her hip, &quot;No complaints here.&quot;  She turned and walked away.  Once she was a good distance from the table, she was smiling again.  Then suddenly she remembered reading about ReeYees brutal death in the paper again, her smile faded once more.  The four of them were the only regular customers she had.  There were faces she knew, but never names.  Working in a diner isn&#146;t what she figured she&#146;d be doing when she got older, obviously; those four kids made a difference in her life, and she hadn&#146;t even realized it &#146;til one of them was gone.  She returned back to the table to say goodbye, but they were gone already.  They left their tip though, $33.38, the same price the bill is every week, including tip.  May was really upset that they were gone now, and as she heard the Huttese Falcon pull away and she couldn&#146;t believe she was starting to cry.  Everything was the same as it had always been when they left, you wouldn&#146;t even notice a change. Customary to every other day as well, was Gaylids phone number on the lone twenty-dollar bill left on the table, this time though, she&#146;d actually use it.<br>
<br>
	And she did use it, just a few hours later.  She called Gaylid up and told them to swing by the Diner before they left and she would have lunches ready for their trip tomorrow.  Even if it was a 4-day trip, a couple of lunches on the first day couldn&#146;t hurt at all.  After the surprising 45 minute phone call from May, Gaylid got his packing done, said goodbye to his mom and headed to Bib&#146;s for the last night they would spend in Minnesota for almost two weeks time.  <br>
	When he got there, Bib&#146;s family was out to eat, but Bib was sitting on his computer, tooling around on Decktech, like he always is.  Bib had a lot of news about the trip, since he had done all the planning over the past 6 hours.  The schedule was to take them to Virginia Beach in three and a half days, plenty of time for Gaylid to compete in day one.  They were going to pick up their friend Pete Klakson in Indiana on the way there, who was already going to drive anyway, but now he was coming with them.  Pete had been a pretty good friend of ReeYees, they had grown up together and Pete had been up to visit many times over the years.  Gaylid was happy because that would break up the trip some, and also bring someone new into the mix that was close with their buddy.  The kicker for the trip, though, was that they were also going to pick up the number three player in the world, and the odds on favorite to win the giant silver plate with the rebel insignia on it in.  Castor Ames was not either of their friends, nor was he Reeyees&#146;s or T.D.&#146;s friend.  They&#146;d be getting him in Pennsylvania.  Gaylid didn&#146;t really know what to think of the idea, but he didn&#146;t despise it.  Castor was a good guy every time they&#146;d met him, but they really didn&#146;t say anything other than hello.  He was the best player around, that&#146;s what everyone had been saying at least, he couldn&#146;t hurt to be around.  Plus as far as everyone knew, he had the ultimate tech to beat everyone that he faced this coming weekend.  As he laid in his sleeping bag on Bib&#146;s floor he knew that this trip was going to be one for the ages, and that it would probably be a life changing experience, as most senior year road trips turned out to be.  For the first time in six days, Gaylid fell asleep easily, with no terrible thoughts of his best friend&#146;s death, and no worries that the next day would be even worse than the day he just had.<br>
<br>
	The next morning Bib woke Gaylid up around 9:30 a.m.  The room was a mess.  Cards were everywhere.  They had almost 18 decks made, only a few with proxies.  Those would be taken care of on their way to the highway; they would stop at ReeYee&#146;s house to pick up his cards, something neither were looking forward to doing.  Going into his old room, picking up his collection and taking it out of there for the last time.  Being in a house that was a crime scene for the past few days, where there friend had died, wasn&#146;t going to be the easiest thing in the world either.<br>
After breakfast, they each had a bag full of decks, and a bag with their clothes.  There was also one large red duffle bag between the two of them that would house the rest of the 800-counts, and the binders that they would have on the trip.  The Huttese falcon was no mini van.  It had a bench seat in the way back, but mostly it was for storage space; it was perfect for this kind of trip.  As they stepped out of Bib&#146;s front door, with their bags hanging off them and dragged behind them, the noticed something they had never seen even come near the Huttese Falcon in all the years they had it.  There was a girl, a blonde girl.  She was damned good looking for a girl that was by &lt;b&gt;their&lt;/b&gt; car, and she was reading ESPN The Magazine while sitting on the hood.  There were two bags by the front right tire, one duffel bag, one backpack.  She jumped off the hood, rolled her magazine and walked over to them &quot;The buzz is you guys are heading out to Deciphercon.&quot;<br>
	This being unbelievable to them, they immediately dropped their bags to their feet and Bib&#146;s jaw dropped likewise.  There was no way this is happening.<br>
        &quot;What buzz?&quot;  Gaylid asked<br>
	&quot;The internet buzz.&quot; This girl responded.<br>
	&quot;What the fukc is the internet?&quot; He said with a smile.<br>
	&quot;You are &lt;b&gt;SO&lt;/b&gt; gay&quot; Bib said correctly.<br>
