Now we will move on to the all-important role of strategy and mechanics. I have broken this into three sections. This is the first, the rest will be coming soon.<br>
<br>
Section 1: Deck Building<br>
<br>
The construction of your deck is a key element of any card game. Many times a game between players of relatively equal playing skills will come down simply to who has the superior deck. In fact many have gone as far to say that your deck is about 90% of whether or not you win. Now I myself won’t go that far, but good deck design is most definitely a major game advantage. So, what makes a good deck anyway? Well there are four basic areas that if managed properly will lead to a strong deck. Deck purpose, balance, efficiency, and grappling.<br>
<br>
A: Deck Purpose<br>
<br>
When building a deck, it is always good to keep in mind exactly what you want the deck to accomplish. No, winning the next tournament doesn’t count as a deck purpose in case your wondering. Deck purpose is wins games against those who do not design with purpose and helps against everyone. For example, I’ve decided to play a heavy discard deck, from both sides. My purpose is to weaken the opponent’s position against me by taking away his resources. My opponent’s decks purpose is to use the strength of rangers and the stealth of hobbits to out race me, while his Nazgul bat me around a bit. We have both built our decks around those goals and thus we know what we are trying to accomplish before the game even begins. Having a deck purpose is a way of keeping yourself on track. Lets say my opponent lays down a site 2 and 3 that allows me to move all the way to 5. Tempting as that may be, it isn’t what my deck was built for and even though the opponent will probably get a site or two ahead of me, the fact is that sticking to your basic purpose will win you more games and thus you stay at site three or four. Before games begin, deck purpose helps you construct the deck itself. Do you want to put a Gimli in a Ranger Race deck, probably not. Why, because he’s not a ranger, he doesn’t help the speed or choke angle of the deck and he requires many cards you shouldn’t be using to become useful. However, I probably do want Gimli in my discard/draw deck. As you can see deck purpose helps you decide both how you should design your deck and how you should play it.<br>
<br>
B. Deck Balance<br>
<br>
Deck balance is kind of a funny term because in using it, you are attempting to tip the scales of the game in your favor, thus unbalancing the game. Deck balance is the ever present line between what your deck does for you and what it gives away to your opponent.  In Lord of the Rings the most obvious balance factor is twilight. When building a deck try and keep track of the twilight number of your cards. I myself try to make a point of giving my opponent as little twilight from my cards as possible. This may seem simple but there are a number of things to account for in reality. For example, lets say your playing a deck centered entirely around Aragorn and Boromir.  You want them to survive the game so your packing 2 armors for Boromir and 2 coats of mail for Aragorn. Each cost 1 twilight, however remember when making a deck to only count the twilight of cards that will actually hit the table, so in the case of our armors and mail we only rack up two twilight. This of course would not be the case if we were talking about elven bows in an elf deck. In that scenario you would want to count the twilight costs of all your bows as they will very likely hit the table. Also always count the costs of your events and conditions as there is a chance they too might all hit the table. Try to keep your decks total twilight cost somewhere between 15 and 20 (companions and allies included), less than 15 would be good. Less then 10 probably means you’ve either taken it way to far or your deck purpose is a twilight choke. Next under the belt of deck balance is site selection. I now many of you out there think that by having your move +1 or Nazgul –5 site out, your going to have a big advantage over the opponent. Well this is only half true. It is very important to remember when selecting your sites that they give their bonuses and penalties to both you and the opponent. Playing a Bree Gates in a ranger race deck may seem like a great idea, but can your Shadow deck stop it? What if the opponent is playing an even better ranger race deck and because of your sites wins the game? Tricky isn’t it. The same can be said of playing the Ford Bruin to help your nasty Nazgul deck. Is your fellowship up for the task of a Witch-King with the Pale Blade at site 3? When choosing your sites never give one side of your deck an advantage your opposing side can’t counter itself. The exception here of course is site 9 and possibly 8, as if you play them your fellowship will likely never make it to them. Now lets move on to character deployment. As a general rule a fellowship is best kept at around 4-5 members this help keep the twilight low and also defends you against a number of nasty conditions and events. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have more companions in your deck, it just means to keep in mind that you only usually need 4-5 out at a time. If you really want more companions, try and pick substitute companions. For example, lets say you had Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli out and those gosh darn orcs killed poor Legolas, well if you had an Arwen in your deck (even better in your hand) then his old role could probably been taken by her or maybe even Haldir. If Gimli had died and you had Farin in deck the same substitution could be made there. The finally note on the subject of deck balance goes to event and card ability choice. When building a deck always keep in mind that many good cards and abilities are double-edged swords. As a rule the effects of any card in your deck should either hurt your opponent far more than you or help you far more than you opponent. For example, Cleaving Blow and Axe Strike are almost always preferable to Battle Fury. Try to keep the total amount of exertion cards in your deck cost about equal to the sum of your fellowships vitality. Sure you have healing in the game, but expect a little damage from the opponent too.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. Efficiency<br>
<br>
Deck Efficiency is probably the most key aspect of any deck construction. Like a well-lubricated machine your deck should be able to churn out just about anything you need anytime you need it. One clear sign of failure to build an efficient deck is the use of the term “dead weight” or “dead card”. In a perfectly efficient deck no such thing exists. Every card in your hand should either be your salvation on this turn or your surprise on the next. It is important to actually now that when your discarding a card, you aren’t tossing out dead weight, your sacrificing an important and potentially useful card for the greater good (or evil as the case may be).  So how do you make an efficient deck? Here are some suggestions:<br>
<br>
1.	Focus your deck and included only cards that you are guaranteed to play start to finish. If you intend to play Aragorn for his ranger abilities, but don’t start him start either Arwen or Boromir, Lord of Gondor and play all three of them. This insures you can play your ranger stuff early and safeguards you from not being able to play them late because your ranger is dead.<br>
2.	Be redundant. Try and play only (or at least more) events, conditions, and possessions that work on more than one member of your fellowship. If you play Aragorn and Arwen, but not Boromir. Then its probably better for you to pack a Swordsman of the Northern Kingdom, rather then a Swordarm of the White Tower.<br>
3.	Never pack more than two of any card that can’t be on the table more than one at a time unless it gives you a way to get the first copy off the table (i.e. There and Back Again). Some cards do let the opponent discard you cards on the table, but the threat of that is usually far less menacing than being caught in a skirmish with a hand of useless already in play junk.<br>
4.	Access equals efficiency. If they fit in your deck, try and play cards that give you greater access potential to your deck. If you play elves, play Elrond. If you play dwarves, play Delving. If you play Moria, play Goblin Scimitars. Greater access to your deck always increases the chance of having the right cards at the right time. Another side to this are cards that grant you access to your discard. Try playing as many of these access cards as possible, but only if they fit your deck purpose.<br>
<br>
D. Grappling<br>
<br>
The final mark of a well-designed deck is its ability to deal with the unexpected or tangent elements of your opponent’s game. While your deck may be focused on a task, perfectly balanced, and as efficient as a well-oiled machine, it is worth nothing if it can’t grapple with the opponent’s tactics. For while you have spent the long night toiling over your perfect deck, so have many others. Often the line between victory and defeat is a decks ability to grapple. Grappling is different for every deck so explaining it is very hard. In the end the only real way to account for it is experience and more importantly play testing. When building a deck always look at its weaknesses not its strengths… if you’ve done a good job your deck probably has so many strengths that you’ll get big-headed and lose to an opposing deck you didn’t bother to consider. Look at the weaknesses and be honest with yourself. Can my Free Peoples handle swarms? Nazgul? Burden-adders? Uruk-hai? Heavy discard? Can my Shadow cripple rangers? Archery? Elves? Stealth? Gandalf? Usually the answer at first will be no to some of these questions. Don’t be disconcerted though. With a little effort and play testing most decks can be transformed into good grapplers. Just remember that the idea isn’t to dominate all opposing decks, it is to dominate many and at least handle the rest. <br>
