<br>
OFFICIAL RULINGS:<br>
Some rules will obviously need to be clarified to adapt to this format. Please reference this document, as I will use it to judge situations.<br>
There are 4 players in each game: 2 Dark players, and 2 Light players. From now on, this document will recognize Dark Player 1 as D1, Dark Player 2 as D2, Light Player 1 as L1, and Light Player 2 as L2. It doesn&#146;t matter for gameplay purposes which teammate is player 1 or 2. Most of these rulings are common sense with a little explanation and lots of specific examples. It may be in your best interest to know the Turn Structure (Section 6) well and flip through the other examples briefly, as not to be caught by surprise. Section 4 has the rules for drawing destinies.<br>
<br>
1. Starting The Game<br>
2. Team Force Loss<br>
3. Targeted Actions<br>
4. Controlling Cards On The Table<br>
5. Losing The Game<br>
6. Turn Structure<br>
7. Misc. Rulings<br>
8. Recommended Deck Combinations<br>
<br>
Section 1 - STARTING THE GAME:<br>
1.1 Each player on a team (L1 and L2, D1 and D2) must provide CLEAR sleeves for their decks. Furthermore, these sleeves MUST BE DIFFERENT between the teammates so anyone can easily recognize which cards belong to which player.<br>
1.2 Both teammates must have decks of 60 cards.<br>
1.3 You may NOT replace your teammate&#146;s locations (for example, deploying your Light Kessel system on your teammate&#146;s already deployed Light Kessel system), but you may replace your opponents&#146; locations. This applies during the game and also when deploying starting locations, whether an objective is used to do so or not.<br>
1.4 Effects on the table affect BOTH player of a team. Secret Plans allows either player to search for Shocking Revelation; Insurrection allows either player to grab a Docking Bay, etc.<br>
1.5 Unique Effects may NOT be played by both teammates at the same time. Being unique, only 1 copy may be on the table at a time.<br>
1.6 According to the previous 3 rulings, you may NOT play the same objective as your teammate, as you must deploy identical locations and/or effects. Also, if your teammate plays Watch Your Step, you may NOT start the Tatooine: Cantina, as it is one of your teammates starting locations.<br>
1.7 You must use your own game text on Interrupts, including Starting Interrupts (see Controlling Cards On The Table). For example, if D1 starts Twi&#146;lek advisor, D2 may NOT search his deck for a starting effect with this interrupt. Keep in mind that Starting Interrupts may be unique, so only 1 player on a team may start a specific interrupt.<br>
<br>
Section 2 - TEAM FORCE LOSS:<br>
2.1 When a &quot;player&quot; (according to a card&#146;s game text) must lose Force, the Force loss is given to the team to handle. Either player may lose this Force, or if the Force loss is &gt; 1, the loss may be split between teammates as those teammates see fit.<br>
2.2 Visage Of The Emperor: each team is required to lose 1 Force at the end of each turn. D1 may lose the Force, or D2 may lose the Force. The Dark Side team decides who will lose the Force. Regardless of who loses the Force, the Force loss MUST be satisfied before play may continue.<br>
2.3a Search &amp; Destroy: The Light Side team is required to lose 1 Force during each draw phase unless a character of destiny &lt; 4 occupies a battleground site. Either player may satisfy this Force loss. If L1 has a character of destiny &lt; 4 that occupies a battleground site and satisfies Search &amp; Destroy, L2 does NOT have to lose Force, as the team has satisfied the requirements. Likewise, if D1 has a character of destiny &lt; 4 at a battleground site and D2 has a character of destiny &lt; 4 at a battleground site, Search &amp; Destroy is NOT lost, as the team has satisfied the requirements of having it on the table.<br>
2.3b I Hope She&#146;s Alright: Same ruling as Search &amp; Destroy.<br>
2.4 Force Drains: During each of your control phases, you may initiate a Force drain as normal. This Force Drain is handed to the other team, and either player may satisfy the drain. The team receiving the drain chooses how to lose the Force; if the drain is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between players as the team sees fit.<br>
2.5 Court Of The Vile Gangster: If either player on a team has a non-droid character on Tatooine (as per the objective game text), the team has satisfied the requirements listed on this card, and neither player must lose Force. If Force needs to be lost, the team losing Force decides who will lose it.<br>
2.6 ... Or Be Destroyed: When Force loss is offered to the Dark Side team according to this objective, the Dark Side team may choose how to split the Force loss.<br>
2.7 Fear: Either Light player may choose who loses the Force off the top of the deck. If the Light team decides to lose 2 cards from hand, one player may lose both cards, or each player may lose 1, as long as the Force loss is satisfied.<br>
2.8 Inserts: When an insert card is &quot;popped&quot; in a deck and damage is required to be dealt, either player on the team losing damage may lose the Force, or the loss may be split. If odds is popped (Never Tell Me The Odds, 3720 To 1), the lowest 3 destiny characters of each team is calculated. If D1 has Emperor Palpatine (destiny 6) and Tech M&#146;or (destiny 6) on the table but D2 has Darth Vader (destiny 1) and Mara Jade (destiny 1) on the table, the team&#146;s 3 lowest destiny characters total 8 (1 + 1 + 6).<br>
2.9 Occupations: Either Light side player may lose the Force as required by Occupation cards. If the damage is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between the teammates as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
2.10 That Thing&#146;s Operational: Either Light side player may lose the Force as required by this card. If the damage is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between the teammates as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
2.11 &quot;Blowing Away&quot; a Rebel Base or a Death Star: Either player may lose the Force as required by this action. If the damage is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between the teammates as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
2.12 R-3PO: If the Dark team is required to lose Force to this character, the Force loss may be satisfied by either player. If the damage is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between the teammates as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
2.13 Battle Damage: If after a battle and attrition, battle damage still exists, the loss may be satisfied by either player. If the damage is &gt; 1, the Force loss may be split between the teammates as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
<br>
Section 3 - TARGETED ACTIONS<br>
3.1 If you play a card that specifically targets a player&#146;s hand, character, etc., you may choose which opponent to target.<br>
3.2a Monnok: The Dark side player may choose which Light player&#146;s hand to target. You may NOT target your teammate&#146;s hand.<br>
3.2b Grimtaash: The Light side player may choose which Dark player&#146;s hand to target. You may NOT target your teammate&#146;s hand.<br>
3.3 Defensive Fire: The Dark player may choose which Light player to target with this card.<br>
3.4a Miyoom Onith: When using this character&#146;s game text, you may choose which opponent&#146;s hand to target. This is a once per turn action. You may NOT look through both opponents&#146; hands, even if you have enough Force to do so. You may NOT target your teammate&#146;s hand. See Controlling Cards On The Table.<br>
3.4b Oola: The same ruling as Miyoom applies.<br>
3.4c Leesub: The same ruling as Miyoom applies.<br>
3.5 Limited Resources: The Light player with 2 or fewer cards in hand MUST lose the Force alone. If both teammates have 2 or fewer cards in hand, the Light team may choose how to split the damage as they see fit as long as the damage is satisfied.<br>
3.6 Epic Duel: The player who loses the Epic Duel MUST lose the Force for that duel.<br>
3.7 Beru Stew: The Light player who plays this card may choose which Dark player activates 2 Force. The Light player who plays the card MUST activate the Force himself.<br>
3.8 Out Of Commission: The Light player chooses which Dark player&#146;s Lost Pile to target.<br>
3.9a Ommni Box: The player using the card must choose which pile to shuffle. This card is NOT unique.<br>
3.9b The Bith Shuffle: The same ruling as Ommni Box applies.<br>
<br>
Section 4 - CONTROLLING CARDS ON THE TABLE<br>
4.1 YOUR cards are YOUR responsibility. For example, if D1 deploys Miyoom Onith, D2 may NOT use her game text; if L2 deploys Luke With Lightsaber, L1 may NOT draw lightsaber destinies for him.<br>
4.2 Drawing Battle Destinies:<br>
4.2.1 Either player may draw the destiny for ability, whether that player has characters participating in the battle or not.<br>
4.2.2 If L1 plays a destiny adding interrupt, L1 MUST draw the extra destinies.<br>
4.2.3 If D2 plays a destiny adding interrupt and loses before the destinies are drawn, D1 may NOT draw the extra destinies.<br>
4.2.4 If L1 has the Millenium Falcon in battle, L2 may use Punch It! (if the requirements are met), even though it is not his Falcon. L2 would draw the extra destinies in this case.<br>
4.2.5 The Light player who plays Fallen Portal must choose the target(s) and draw the destiny for the card.<br>
4.3 Either teammate may use a Force to activate Maneuvering Flaps or S-Foils, etc.<br>
4.4a Twi&#146;lek Advisor: The Dark player who plays Twi&#146;lek Advisor must search his own Reserve deck for an effect. You may NOT search through your teammate&#146;s deck for an effect.<br>
4.4b The Signal: The Light player who plays The Signal must search his own Reserve deck for an effect. You may NOT search through your teammate&#146;s deck for an effect.<br>
4.5 L1&#146;s General Crix Madine may NOT search through L2&#146;s deck for a scout.<br>
4.6 If ISB Operations is on the table, both Dark players&#146; applicable characters become ISB agents.<br>
4.7 If ISB Operations is flipped, either player may retrieve an ISB agent as allowed by the objective.<br>
4.8 If Hidden Base is flipped, D2 may NOT pay the Force for D1 to draw a card. The player paying MUST be the player drawing.<br>
4.9 If L1 is playing with Watch Your Step, L2&#146;s non-smuggler cards with ability (as per the objective) ARE deploy +6.<br>
4.10 If D2&#146;s Vader&#146;s Lightsaber is on D1&#146;s Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith, D2 must draw the weapon destiny, but D1 must draw the &quot;choke&quot; destiny. Either player may draw the battle destiny if one is allowed.<br>
4.11 If D1&#146;s Mara Jade, The Emperor&#146;s Hand is on the table, D2 may NOT search his Reserve deck for a weapon using her game text.<br>
4.12 D1 deploys Mara Jade and searches for a weapon using her game text. If she dies and D2 later deploys another Mara Jade, he may NOT search for her saber. Once per game refers to the team, not the individual player.<br>
<br>
Section 5 - LOSING THE GAME<br>
5.1 When a player runs out of card in his Life Force, he is removed from play. His lost pile, cards in hand, out of play, and ALL other cards from his deck are immediately removed from the table. Note that this may cause cards such as Search And Destroy to also be lost if the requirements are no longer met. Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi may flip if Vader was removed from the table.<br>
5.2 All players are allowed (and recommeded) to count the cards removed from the table to ensure the original 60 cards are there. Since each team member uses different sleeves, removing cards and verification of those cards should not take long.<br>
5.3 If this action requires a location to be removed from play, all cards at that location are immediately lost.<br>
5.4 If a ship and/or vehicle leaves play, all cards on and targeting that ship/vehicle are also lost.<br>
5.5 If a ship/vehicle is lost and sites related to that ship/vehicle are on the table, those do NOT need to leave play, as Executor sites may be on the table even though the Executor is not. The Executor in this case was not lost; instead, the player was removed from play.<br>
5.6 With the previous rule in mind, cards such as Evacuate may NOT target characters aboard a losing player&#146;s capital starship, as the starship is not &quot;lost,&quot; but instead the player was removed from play.<br>
5.7 Play continues until both member of the same team are defeated.<br>
<br>
Section 6 - TURN STRUCTURE<br>
6.1 The Dark team always goes first, then the Light team (unless otherwise specified on a card, ie Yavin 4: Throne Room).<br>
6.2 Actions alternate between teams (Dark team has the first action, then the Light team has the next action, etc.) Either teammate may take the team&#146;s action.<br>
6.3 ACTIVATE PHASE:<br>
6.3.1 A Dark player (either one) activates a Force (or any other applicable action), then the Light team gets an action. Either Dark player, regardless of who activated the previous Force, may activate another Force if the Force icons allow (or any other applicable action), then the Light team gets another action.<br>
6.3.2 Either Dark player may activate any amount of Force, and the Force activation may be split between the teammates as they see fit.<br>
6.3.3 Your team may NOT activate more Force than is allowed by Decipher&#146;s official rules.<br>
6.3.4 Each player may activate an extra Force other than the icons on the table, representing that player&#146;s own Life Force. Normally, this is a +1. When you have 2 players on a team, it becomes +2 instead.<br>
6.4 CONTROL PHASE<br>
6.4.1 The Dark team may declare a Force drain as normal; the Light team may choose how to split that Force loss.<br>
6.5 DEPLOY PHASE<br>
6.5.1 D1 MUST use D1&#146;s Force pile to deploy and/or use D1&#146;s cards.<br>
6.5.2 D1 may NOT use D2&#146;s Force pile to deploy and/or use D1&#146;s cards.<br>
6.5.3 You MUST use your own Force for your actions; activate wisely.<br>
6.6 BATTLE PHASE<br>
6.6.1 For rules on drawing destinies, see Section 4.<br>
6.6.2 If the Dark team initiates a battle, either player may use the Force to do so.<br>
6.6.3 If the cost to initiate battle is &gt; 1 Force, the cost may be split between both teammates.<br>
6.6.4 The defending team gets the first &quot;just&quot; action or react.<br>
6.6.5 There is no limit to the number of &quot;just&quot; actions or reacts.<br>
6.6.6 Moose<br>
6.6.7 The initiating team gets the first battle action.<br>
6.6.8 If Draw Their Fire is on the table and a Dark player wants to play an interrupt during battle, the player using the interrupt MUST pay the Force to do so.<br>
6.6.9 Battle damage may be split between teammates.<br>
6.7 MOVE PHASE<br>
6.7.1 you must use the required Force to move your own characters.<br>
6.7.2 D1 may NOT pay the Force to move D2&#146;s characters.<br>
6.7.3 In the case of Docking Bay Transit, both teammates may split the cost of transit, even if one teammate doesn&#146;t have any characters involved in said transit.<br>
6.8 DRAW PHASE<br>
6.8.1 You may NOT draw your teammate&#146;s cards into your hand.<br>
<br>
Section 7 - MISC RULINGS<br>
7.1 Catch cards: Cards that are &quot;caught&quot; are considered out of play, as per Decipher&#146;s official rulings. Cards that are caught should be treated as such throughout the remainder of the game, even if the catch card leaves the table (as a player is defeated). All &quot;caught&quot; cards should be placed out of play if this action occurs.<br>
7.2 It&#146;s Worse: The player using this card MUST pay to increase the Force loss; his teammate may NOT use Force to add damage using this card.<br>
7.3 Lando: Cards that target &quot;your Lando&quot; refer to your team&#146;s persona of Lando.<br>
7.4 Time Limits: Each game is limited to 2 hours. Modified wins / losses will be awarded if the time is reached without a clear winner as per Decipher&#146;s rulings.<br>
7.5 Retrieval:<br>
7.5.1 The player initiating the Force retrieval Force MUST do so.<br>
7.5.2 Retrieval may NOT be split.<br>
7.5.3 L1 may NOT pay for L2&#146;s retrieval.<br>
7.5.4 L1 may NOT draw for or retrieve for L2&#146;s Edge card.<br>
7.5.5 If L1 is playing Mind What You Have Learned, L1 MUST retrieve the 10 Force for flipping the objective if he manages to do so.<br>
7.6 Kessel Run: Either Dark player may draw the Kessel Run destiny; the Dark team chooses which player does so.<br>
7.7 If D1 plays a Death Star location, D2 may NOT play any Death Star 2 locations as each team may only deploy locations from one of the Death Stars, according to Decipher&#146;s official rulings.<br>
7.8 if D1 has an Admiral&#146;s Orders on the table and D2&#146;s Grand Admiral Thrawn is on the table with his game text, D1 MAY take the cancelled Admiral&#146;s Orders into hand, assuming the requirements are met.<br>
7.9 Sabacc:<br>
7.9.1 If sabacc is played ALL players get a hand.<br>
7.9.2 If the Light team initiates sabacc, one of the Dark teammates takes the first draw, then the other Dark teammate gets his draw, then a Light teammate gets a draw, and finally the Light teammate who initiated sabacc gets the last draw.<br>
7.9.3 If teammates tie for the winning hand there is NO winner.<br>
7.9.4 The wier may choose AY player to be the loser - whether he has stakes or not, even if another player has stakes.<br>
7.9.5 You MAY steal cards from your teammate! Sabacc, like many other card games of chance, is a free for all.<br>
7.10 Members of the same team ARE allowed to look at each other&#146;s cards in hand, but they may NOT give each other their cards.<br>
7.11 This tournament will NOT be sanctioned by Decipher.<br>
