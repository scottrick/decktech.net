I&#146;ve already had a blast at parties and enjoying my college life.  I come home and check my email and such.  I come across decktech and have to pay my dues to this site.  Now I have recieved a fair amount of D-Mail recently with questions on my thoughts of SWCCG.  Well here they are.<br>
<br>
The game is in a very bad condition right now.  It really sucks.  The game had come down to direct damage and pure dumbness.  If you are happy with podracing, senators, and all of this other non star wars stuff - then enjoy... cause this defensive shield is just gonna make the game much, much, much, MUCH worse.  Hey you play hidden base?  I can beat that!  Inserts?  Dagobah?  Let me get my magic bullets.  This may very well be the end of the game.  IMO Decipher should stop this current course and change to something else, cause if i have to buy another &quot;Epp&quot; I&#146;ll scream.  <br>
<br>
I&#146;m sorry but many of you may be upset with this statment, but the game requitres much less skill now that it ever did in the past.  Think I&#146;m wrong?  Lets look at some of the top decks in the meta.  Huntdown podracing (no offense to certain players...) but how much skil does it take to play 7&#146;s and racing???  Dagobah AFA.  Hey, I can teach my dog to play inserts... and a deck of like 10 of them... damn.  Lets look at brangus.  A very, very, VERY unique deck type which does involve skill to play.  But among upper tier players I think the deck has become bland and lame.  It&#146;s the same game every time.  Blah, blah, blah... beast combo, blah, blah, blah, unflip WYS... STUPID!  <br>
<br>
I must admit that part of my motivation to write this article was Kyle Crafts depature of the game.  (not to mention the dude that burned Kraft for leaving... not cool).  The best part of this game has been and will always be the players.  Not the cards or any of that other stuff.  Granted thats where all of this is based on - but any person traveling to a tourney is looking to have a good time.  To say you play to be a competitor is just a dumb statement.  Play basketball, baseball or do something physical to be competitive.  I know the most fun I&#146;ve had with this game is discovering a &quot;broken combo&quot;, driving to Montreal and pulling over for &quot;fries&quot;, playing with friends till 5 am, having dude&#146;s fly from Colorado just to hang, or deciding how many sandwhirls to put in your friend&#146;s day 3 deck (i believe 4 was the correct number).<br>
<br>
The meta currently sucks.  The game is no fun.  It has been dissolved to mains with their toys - and gimmicks.  Will the game last?  probably because like freaks and geeks we all want to see a 8th version of boba fett.  Sooner or later this game will catch up with itself and end.  One thing I must get off of my shoulders.  (And as an editors note, no matter what rank you give me - i&#146;ve already done my job.  Hell - you&#146;ve read this much, gimme a *, is the world gonna end?  Will people listen to me less or not respect me?  No.)  But anyway back to my thought, some people who play this game are sad, very sad.  I don&#146;t want to name names but you KNOW who you are.  Prissy, whining, complaing people who live and die for this game.  I would just like to know what else you players have going for you, because you look pathetic.  I&#146;m not looking for a fight - but I wish that the upper tier players would get their act together and not be such ^&amp;%*&amp;^% to the community.  It&#146;s something that just really bothers me, especially since me and chris have been thorugh so much crap through the years, not to mention being ripped off, bullied and verbally abused by the games &quot;finest.&quot;  Well - I think its sad that players can&#146;t even have a normal conversation about life or the game no-less with out attitudes of &quot;dude you cant have my tek!!!&quot;  SCREW IT!!!    <br>
<br>
WHen i read stuff about players saying &quot;which deck do you think should be ranked higher?&quot; that also gets under my skin.  I don&#146;t have a clue who said it - but whomever you are.... your an @$$.  Is this a rant.  You bet ya.  Do you have to ever read this again - not at all.  I guess the point of this thing was to demand a little respect from ALL players of all skill levels for the game and each other.  Some stuff ain&#146;t right - and it amazes me what people will let go to their heads to treat another person in such a way - most humans wouldn&#146;t take it.<br>
<br>
I really hope this didn&#146;t make you think too much, cause really I&#146;m just angry at alot of things.  This game used to be something I love - and know it&#146;s become almost work due to the designers, the players, and the attitudes.  The only joys left in the game are teaching newbies - or playing wih family.  When I have to deal with tecking and deck building and all that other meta&#146;ing - it just becoems a HUGE headache.  Like I said before - we can teach anyone to throw dice.  And so is the current swccg. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
