Hayes has helped me, and others like me, more times than I can remember when it comes to deckbuilding, game strategy, or which one of those interrupts you should cut to get yourself down to 60 cards.  And the reason that Hayes has helped so many people is that, with a rating of 2242, Hayes is the second highest-rated Star Wars player on Earth.  And that means that a lot of people want to know his opinion of the game.<br>
<br>
Hayes started playing the game at about the same time as another Star Wars great, Bastian Winkelhaus, just before the release of the Dagobah expansion.  Since then, Hayes has steadily built his game up to this climatic year, when he won Massachussetts States, placed first at Ramapocon, first at the Denver DPC, second at the Phoenix DPC and third at Freedomcon.  He has single-handedly made Goo Nee Tay and Bad Feeling Have I two of the most popular cards again.  He has brought back force denial in a big way.  And as for the rest of the game . . . <br>
<br>
JT: What skill do you think a Star Wars player most needs to be successful?<br>
HH: Well, anyone can spend hundreds of dollars on the game, and anyone can play in hundreds of tournament games or go to the big events, but it takes a special person to actually win hundreds of Star Wars games: the person has to be motivated.  A player has to be consumed by a sense of competition to really be highly successful.  In most cases, you either have that drive, or you don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
JT: How often do you play when you aren&#146;t in a tournament?<br>
HH: Nowadays, not at all, outside of playtesting new cards or preparing for a major event maybe.<br>
<br>
JT: As you prepared for the semi-final confrontation against Martin Akesson, you knew he was playing Lightsaber Combat, and that his deck was a bad matchup for yours.  Did you have any specific strategy on how to handle his deck?<br>
HH: Yup.  Here&#146;s the excerpt from my FCon TR that can be found in my HDADTJ SOLID: <br>
<br>
Semi Finals<br>
HDADTJ Vs Martin Akesson&amp;#8217;s LSC<br>
My dark is a cinch to play against everything... except LSC. What does LSC do? It kills Dark Jedi-dependent Mains and Toys. So what do you have to do to beat the deck if you are using Dark Jedi dependent Mains and Toys? You can&amp;#8217;t avoid them and drain, obviously, so you have to fight them. But how do you do that when they can kill off one of your Jedi each of their move <br>
phases (if they are lucky)? The key is to get 2 of your Dark Jedi to one of their sites so they can&amp;#8217;t duel all of your fighting power off at once (allowing you to retaliate with substance).<br>
<br>
So here&amp;#8217;s the ideal set up: you get some activation going, then drop Maul and Vader and some fodder to where ever they are on Naboo, and cancel/prevent their anti battle stuff (Dodge, Barrier, Blast The Door, Kid!, etc.) and do some battle damage, and lose your fodder.<br>
<br>
Here&amp;#8217;s how it usually goes: drop on them, and they Dodge away cause you can&amp;#8217;t spend the entire game drawing for your cancel cards.<br>
<br>
It really doesn&amp;#8217;t matter which way it goes, except you need to make sure 2 of your Jedi are alive on their turn. With your Jedi on their sites they are forced to come at you since they can no longer drain, and this is where you lay the beats. You can drop that Fett and whatever you&amp;#8217;ve been holding in your hand and really do some damage. Let them run away again, if they want. <br>
You are now draining and they are not. They are wasting cards to run away and you are not, and you can keep deploying Jedi to keep pace with whomever they duel off. Sooner or later, however, you will get some nice destiny tracked so you won&amp;#8217;t have to keep losing your character though. So you&amp;#8217;ll win.<br>
<br>
JT: You had a very impressive performance at Freedomcon, losing only to Scott Lingrell&#146;s RST by 3 and timing out against Paul Myers.  Would you say that this is as well as you hoped to do?<br>
HH: No, I had the ability to win both games.  Against Scott I was just careless (I won the same matchup by 14 when we played in the preliminary finals) and Paul just played so slow (though Scum vs. WYS is a slow game anyhow).<br>
<br>
JT: We have seen a breakthough of Hayes-itis this year.  You won Ramapocon, and since then people have been copying your decks.  Everyone used to play &quot;Hayes&#146; Brilliant Pile,&quot; and now they all play &quot;Hayes&#146; WYS&quot; and &quot;Hayes&#146; HDADTJ.&quot;  How do you explain your sudden popularity in the game?<br>
HH: I&#146;ve gotten older.  Being older just means you can drive to more tournaments, make more money, and your parents will let you travel to big events, which is the key.  Through doing consistently well at some of this year&#146;s big events I&#146;ve gotten more exposure.  People write about me in their TRs, and I help tons of people with decks (yourself included) so my name just pops up all over the place I guess.<br>
<br>
JT: You seem to have a very standard formula for your decks: they almost always have the same number of characters and a pretty standard space package.  Why do you think this formula for deckbuilding is the best available?<br>
HH: That&#146;s exactly it: I only *seem* to have a standard formula.  I don&#146;t play 18 characters or whatever bcause I think 18 is the magical number on its own accord.  Certainly various decks require more or less based on what type they are, and that&#146;s what the key is.  My decks are all derived from the same formula designed to compliment my play style - SOLID - it just so happens that I have found 18 or so characters works best with said style.  As for my formula, well I guess it is kinda standard.  If I&#146;m building a dark deck I will make a list of every light deck out there, no matter how viable.  Operatives, RTP, HB mains, HBX, HB Flip, MWYHL, etc.  I then go and edit that list, crossing off the crummy decks (like RTP or Operatives) and put a star or something next to the top 5 or 6 decks I expect to encounter (like LSC or WYS).  I then go down the list another time and imagine myself using each of those decks.  I try to think of what I&#146;d hate most to play against using that light deck, what would make me say &quot;Oh @#$%,&quot; and make me think I couldn&#146;t win.  I do that for all the light decks, then look at the results for any trends.  Basically, I try to think of a dark deck that can incorporate the most important &quot;Oh @#$%s&quot; and can take advantage of the trends I saw, and I make it 60 cards.  When I&#146;m done I can feel confident knowing exactly how my deck should play against every conceivable light deck available.<br>
<br>
JT: You just moved into a new area of the United States, and have gone from being in a state full of top players to a state right next to the number 1 player.  How do you think the new competition will affect your playing?<br>
HH: Well, being adjacent to Colorado doesn&#146;t mean much since Brian is a good 12 hour drive from me, and I don&#146;t even own a car!  But new competition is always a benefit.  I mean I love playing in Massachusetts, but it&#146;s always fun to meet and play some new faces - I&#146;ve actually picked up quite a few tricks while treading water here in the sea.<br>
<br>
JT: Speaking of the number on player, you and Brian Hunter seem to have somewhat of a rivalry going on, not only in person but also across the message boards.  What is your opinion of him as a player?<br>
HH: As I&#146;ve said before, he&#146;s a great player - easily one of the best in the world - but I&#146;m not impressed by him.  I&#146;ve played (and lost to) better players.  I don&#146;t know, maybe it&#146;s just me, but I find his defensive style of play very easy to interpret (and beat), but perhaps it&#146;s just the way our play style&#146;s interact.  When we played at DPC Denver all he did was complain about how his decks should own mine but didn&#146;t because of his bad hand (sound familiar?).<br>
<br>
JT: You&#146;re ranked number two in the world right now, with a rating of almost 2300.  Have you got your sites set on the number one spot now?<br>
HH: I&#146;ve had my sites set on that spot for some time now, yes.<br>
<br>
JT: A couple of times I have heard you say that you had your &quot;entire deck tracked.&quot;  Is this a literal statement?  Do you actually know where every card is at all times?<br>
HH: Yeah, it&#146;s pretty easy when you only have two cards left!  Actually, no it&#146;s not a literal statement.  It&#146;s conceivable that I could track my entire deck, but when I say that in my TRs (usually late game, when I only have 20 or so cards left) or whatever I usually mean I have most of whatever&#146;s left of my reserve deck and the top half of my force pile accounted for.  Basically, the more time I am given to look at and set up cards with used interrupts and Mirax, etc. (before they get shuffled or something) the more cards I can keep track of, in both player&#146;s decks.<br>
<br>
JT: A big part of your play style seems to be force denial: you give your opponent few or no icons, and then play multiple copies of cards like Bad Feeling Have I and Goo Nee Tay to get their deploy cost up.  Why do you feel this is the best way to play?<br>
HH:  Remember in the first Premiere rule booklet how it said something along the lines of &quot;You are a Jedi Master, and your success to victory depends on how well you can manage the Force,&quot; well, as corney as that sounds, it&#146;s the truth.  It&#146;s really the most simple concept in the game.  Look at things this way: there are basically 2 types of decks out there, those that win <br>
through draining and direct damage, then there are those that win through battling.  I build all of my decks based on the belief that fighting/confrontational decks should win against direct damage decks 100% of the time.  I mean, if they are draining, how hard is it to deploy to <br>
where they are and out battle them if that is what your deck is designed to do?  And thanks to the shields, now almost all of the non confrontational direct damage has been elminated as well.  So that leaves other battle oriented decks to worry about.  Assuming you are equally matched as far as weapons and destiny and other various tricks (even though that shouldn&#146;t be the case) if you are getting more force than the opponent you will be able to 1) deploy more, so you should be able to fight better, and 2) draw more, again allowing you to fight more successfully.  Goo and BFHI merely add insult to injury.  Not only do (most of) my decks deprive the opponent of force, but they penalize them severly for it.<br>
<br>
JT: You look like a giant in the Freedomcon pictures.  For the record, how tall are you?<br>
HH: 2.03 Meters.<br>
<br>
JT: Your decks are already inspiration to those with deck-builders block, myself included.  What advice can you give to those who want to better their game?<br>
HH: Play more.  I haven&#146;t gotten to where I am today just by playing in occassional tournaments.  I&#146;ve played nearly 500 sanctioned games and literally thousands of &quot;fun&quot; games.<br>
