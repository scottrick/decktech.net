<br>
I don&amp;#8217;t know and I don&amp;#8217;t think that the Player Advocates do either. They may know the direction they want it to go in, but let&amp;#8217;s face it, the game is changing and so will the rules and the cards.<br>
<br>
Before I go on I will put into words something no one wants to say. Our beloved game SW:CCG is a dieing game. It is by no means a dead game yet. It even has a unique opportunity to grow. Yes that&amp;#8217;s right, grow. I believe that VC&amp;#8217;s can make this game grow if they are taken in the right direction. That brings me back to my original subject. The direction of VC&amp;#8217;s or how I think they should go.<br>
<br>
The concept of VC&amp;#8217;s is great. The main problem I see with them as they are now is that they don&amp;#8217;t allow for new players, players that just started the game or those that have only a few cards or none at all. Here is how I think we can fix that problem.<br>
<br>
1.	Eliminate the need to have a certain card in order to play with a VC. The VC&amp;#8217;s as they are now are just virtual text.<br>
2.	Print all stats on the VC (assuming we continue to get only the bottom half.) Power. Ability, etc&amp;#8230; and have the VC be able to be inserted into a sleeve with any Luke or Vader for example.<br>
3.	Print out a whole card (top to bottom) minus the picture and or copyrighted names. This will give us players the option to cut out the space where the picture goes so that when we slid the VC into the sleeve the original shows through or we can just write in that space the mane of the character or card. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t even have to own a Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight to play with one. Players that don&amp;#8217;t want to or can&amp;#8217;t play with card sleeves can just glue the VC onto one of their many common cards and poof, brand new card.<br>
<br>
How can we get new players into the game if they can never get or it&amp;#8217;s too hard to get a certain card to play with?<br>
4.	Work on cards that make objectives that are weak stronger so that they are on a par with other objectives. I would love to play a good strong deck with Yavan 4 locations and fighter squadrons.<br>
5.	Improve cards no one uses not improve cards that are already strong. Why do we need another Vader when we can have Stromtroopers with a built in Dark Jedi Presence.<br>
6.	Uhh. Counter to the above. Make obvious cards. How about a Vader for lightsaber combat, Yoda with a warrior icon, Mace Windu with lightsaber, Darth Sudious&amp;#8217; lightsaber, Leia in a night gown&amp;#8230;. Oh, sorry about that last one.<br>
7.	More EPP cards. Some good ones that are not too strong like, Rebel Trooper with blaster rifle, Rebel Trooper with utility belt, Royal Guard with force pike, Tie fighter with cannon. Some that is a little stronger like&amp;#8230; Red 5 with X-wing laser cannons, AAT with Energy shell launchers.<br>
8.	New card types. I have a few that I with release in a later letter after a little more play testing. One is showing a lot of promise and should have been done a long time ago.<br>
9.	While we&amp;#8217;re at it, how about some good effects that are not immune to alter. Alter and its brother are dead cards because there are too many effects (and good ones at that) that you can never get rid of. How about changing the ruling to state, &amp;#8220;Cards with immunity to Alter/Sense only have that immunity while in play. Thus they may be Altered/Sensed as they are coming into play.&amp;#8221;<br>
<br>
Now I know the idea of totally new cards (VC&amp;#8217;s glued to other cards) can be abused. Why not throw 7 EPP Mace Windu&amp;#8217;s into a deck? Sorry you can&amp;#8217;t. Why not? We limit the number of each VC you can have in your deck. 3 or 4 would be great, you could play with enough to have a strong deck but you couldn&amp;#8217;t go over board on broken cards.<br>
<br>
This could literally be only the beginning of this game, or the middle of this game, not the end.<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think.<br>
