Balance to the force<br>
<br>
What a web we wee. For years ground players have mess advantages. They had multiple destiny draws in the battles. They were able to cancel destinies. Ground players able to stop battle with one red car. They were able to force players not to cancel force drains. The ground players able to move and duck from shadows to attack and run. But no more. With the new space card, it makes them more diversify in their decks. It&amp;#8217;s a search and destroy card for space. No more of, who can out, drain whom but rather who can built a more equal deck. This new card is &amp;#8220;At last we are getting results.&amp;#8221; <br>
<br>
Hidden base was a powerful objective for the light side for years. Promising players and masters of the game used the objective to make them invisible. Such as x-wing swarm decks with punishing blows. Hidden Base gave hidden operatives with mess attacks with deadly drains. Hidden base gave I&amp;#8217;ll take the leader fallen portal method. These destroyed other decks before it started. In conjunctive, the decipher decided to use bullet cards and errata. Some of these are, security precaution, no escape, and search and destroy. These Additives made light side to change tactics to ground battling. Also, mauls ship and turbo charged chimera killed light side&amp;#8217;s chances in space. Changes in hidden base killed the once loved objective to a pathetic new bee objective. Of course, light side still looks good with dash Render and home one unfortunately the equal Librium was no more. <br>
<br>
The tattooing decks such as vile gangsters, scum and wato&amp;#8217;s junkyard objectives made dark side sit on their butts and wait for victims. Never have to worry for hidden base rising its head again. Place mauls ship and search and destroyed out it&amp;#8217;s a safe bet to kill any good space deck without a real effort. But with the new card in treed place it pushes good players to come to space. Rather than sitting in two ground places, the ground player most introduce its decks to space. It does not want to lose one force for every turn. It&amp;#8217;s a powerful tool for a good space deck. It brings balance to the force. Now good tie deck or good set your course for Alderean can compete with a ground deck. It can force them to come to space and make them use their skills. Made them pack some good cards and able to think twice hard to stay alive. <br>
<br>
Echo base and Endor opts will be more viable. It can force players to be diversity there decks. Make them have battles in space or die quickly. As we can see lately, decipher brain trust wants players to diversity its decks. Finally some forward vision. See in three dimension playing style. As we can see from last few objectives, quiet mining colony (improvements), watch your step (space and ground diversity), death star 2, MOB, building these decks must be well diversity in space and ground.  Most have ground crew to build and operated the objectives.  There are advantages in space for both sides. Massive drains from echo base, massive force lose from death star two. Menace fades from quiet mining colony and Watch your step made attractive to diversity and going with space. But they had no help in space control. Only force drain and the opponent could keep its force in few powerful pockets and kill the opponent in their few places and end the game. There space fleet did not matter except in battle order/battle plan requirements. <br>
<br>
Search and destroy is a huge card. But now it has a neutralizer for it.  It brings balance to the game that has been trouble with huge disadvantages. This might be the last set or not, it is or not, but finally decipher has came up with the card that is required from the beginning. In my final say, I would like to add that decipher made this game what it is. It made from starch with faults, trial and errors but it kept people playing. I am no fan of decipher any mean but decipher keep going. The people came and went. People had fun when they played. People expanded their minds and open their souls to their opponents. We made friends and learned to spend money without worrying about rent.  Decipher created this game from an idea, we made it last this long and fun, now its up to the lawyers to give it a future. I hope decipher keeps the game. If not its time to move on and try new experiences. Live long and prosper in Gene Rodenbarry&amp;#8217;s words. <br>
