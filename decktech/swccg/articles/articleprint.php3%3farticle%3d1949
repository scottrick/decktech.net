<br>
Hello let me first to introduce myself my name is Cat Ceder, out of Santa Barbara, CA.<br>
<br>
This is an article on the life of Star Wars and the decks that it&#146;s brought from the beginning to the point that we are at now...<br>
<br>
Back in &#146;95 Decipher released this interesting little game called Star Wars, well me being a HUGE fan of the movie as are most of the players in the game, I flocked to the store to purchase my packs of packs and eventually boxes of boxes and have come quite the distance in the game (including become a Decipher Squadron Member - Rogue 14). As I played this game when it first came out it was a High S/A game (Sense and Alter, Control wasn&#146;t out yet) and most of the decks were heavy attrition adders for the lightside, and the darkside had the ever loving Dark Jedi Presence, (cause noone wanted to use Aliens cause they weren&#146;t that useful, of course neither is Tagge but that&#146;s besides the point).<br>
<br>
So the decks were set pretty much in stone and were played consistently...but alas when the next set came out (albiet later than should have been) the game changed a little it brought forth a Epic Event...A WHAT??? yes, an Epic Event (a purple card) of which people looked hesitantly at and decided that it would be better to sit with what they know. Space became a little more of thing for the dark side, and the light side couldn&#146;t really consider heading up there unless it was in mass...but some made their way to space, not to be beaten down, but to be somewhat usefull, but alas most decks headed back to their lovingly homes on Tatooine and battled it there where most of the games nowadays hide.<br>
<br>
As for decks w/a few minor tweaks here and there they pretty much were all the same (of course that could be said about now as well) but things went as they should...then the next set came out and that changed alot of things, especially for the light side - Space became something that was possible...w/EBO and power equalled something good and thus they had a chance to battle, however the Dark Side got a hold of the &quot;monster&quot; Walkers and started invading Hoth, and thus again, everyone went back to Tatooine...(does that seem about right)...well the Walkers follwed to Tatooine and the Lightside didn&#146;t really have much to compete with against them so they went inside with Revolutions and 2/0 sites to get nice forcedrains. They could have used Snowspeeders or Rebel Speeders, but the power to use em, and the combos that were needed weren&#146;t really worth the effort. So against Dark Side got the ground outside and Light Side took it inside to avoid the squishing.<br>
<br>
Then another set came out....Dagobah, introducing the Muppet and the Hunters, but alas no Boba Fett yet...this was most likely one of the most pivotal sets in the game it brought forth the Control, that the game was lacking, and also brought along some of the more useful cards in the game that made it what it was...Jedi Testing, and Power for the Darkside...that&#146;s how it was till the next set or two came out but that was that and this is now....As for Dagobah, bringing us like I said Control, it shifted the balance of S/A because once Control came out most people put aside thier S/A for the better Control thus opening some more space in their deck for other cards...at least on average 4 more...of course there were ways around that because they brought in the use of &quot;grabber&quot; cards to make them pay more to use em, or only be able to use em once per turn. Also along the way, Decipher brought forth some Rebel Leader packs, something that Space really needed and that everyone had in their decks as well...Deploy, battle, and draw destiny...that&#146;s sweet....and lastly Dagobah brought out something for the light side to counter space...a little that is...LANDING CLAW (of course cards came out that cancelled that as well).<br>
<br>
All this time if you weren&#146;t playing in space you were still on the ground...where...Tatooine, yes Tatooine damnit the best place to play, and why you ask...well it&#146;s the only system in the galaxy where you can get enough sites to do almost anything...and get good Force drains...because Special Edition wasn&#146;t out yet....<br>
<br>
As for Dagobah and the ones before the game still played pretty much the same without to many altercations...however Cloud City was gonna change that...and it did. It brought forth the CLOUDS...and that was where people started looking back to some of their older ideas...and hmmmm......Dagobah rang in everyones mind...Dagobah, Clouds, Miners, Muppets, and Force Draining...Good stuff...still w/Jedi Test 1 complete most of the Dark Side&#146;s Force draining was limited but when it wasn&#146;t they would do that and do that in abundance...DARK DEAL and that brought forth one of the more powerful versions for the Dark Side...just what they needed...more power...anyhow it brought us more power and more force draining and BOBA FETT - yes the man and the legend....but again like the old, when people got tired of their &quot;fun&quot; decks they again reverted to their Tatooine decks, yes again Tatooine...and played w/a little more variation, it also brought us Sabbac and two Landos one for each side, and that made it a little weird...cause light side wouldn&#146;t go to Cloud City except to block a force drain w/a Undercover Spy and stay on their favorite place...yup you guessed it Tatooine...Well w/Cloud City, and clouds and all it&#146;s fun happy stuff...what else is there to do...deploy, battle, force drain...retrieve...what...we craved more and needed more to do...and thus I bring Jabba&#146;s Palace.<br>
<br>
Ah... Jabba&#146;s Palace not a better place in the world for Scum and Villany...and that&#146;s the truth one of the most important cards made at least for the Dark Side...battle, retrieve my god...well at least it&#146;s limited no Imps on the table...that&#146;s good...NOT...cause that brought the dreaded Bounty out of the decks and thus made those once useless Bounty Hunters, useful and brought them back in force, good for us...right, wrong...the light side got the shaft, but they did get some useful cards, and aliens and Bo-Shuda to cancel battles in the Audience Chamber along with that some somewhat useful cards to make things work for them, but alas it was turning into a Mains and Toys for the lightside and powerful to the boot to kill the darkside and not allow them to battle and retrieve. That&#146;s been the lightside key, and to change that is bad...so the Light Side went on the attack, and that was working for a while...people still played aliens and started playing Imperials...and started fighting back...Noooo...that was bad...but non the less the Dark Side still had the advantage and was still winning the war in the game...Fortunately there are more things to come and more sets to work with...after which Jabba&#146;s Palace came the illustrious Special Edition - the long awaited update to the universe and the pretty much downfall of the game for what it brought was a boon, it was also a curse.<br>
<br>
Special Edition brought back alot of the oldies in new rare forms...Ben Kenobi, and Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith, and one of the most wanted cards in the game OUTER RIM SCOUT...and it also brought the biggest twist to the game...OBJECITVES...as these were set, and started to become mainstream decks people thought little of them at first, and then started finding what clicked for them and what the best of the best were...RalOps and MWYHL/SYIC the two best objectives in the game, Hidden Base was great as well but still soemthing about it wasn&#146;t all that till the errata came out - for most of them they were WAY to powerful, and made the game rather boring...but Decipher in their infinite wisdom realized their mistakes and quickly changed the themes of the Objectives at least to their presnet date they are were quite powerful indeed and made the game go in a completely different place, away from the movie trilogy, and into something else...granted the game was still fun and still enjoyable, just different, after the Objectives were on the market for some time, some of the bigger named people started dropping out of the game because they thought that it was a waste of their time, and some of the newer people that came into the game were excited that they two could be on par with the big boys when it came to playing. As for the Objectives where they stood it made or broke the game pending on who was playing what and where they were playing...It moved away from Tatooine, poor Tatooing, and went to places like Bothawui and Raltiir...whatever those were...but eventually it came full circle again as more sets came out again, people started reverting back to their favorite place, Tatooine, and again Tatooine made it&#146;s mark on the game again...but some straglers still played on other planets but they always made a comeback to their favorite...So with that as Special Edition settles and the dust rests, and people come back to the game, and inbetween some other things came out like Enhanced and Anthology cards...they made the game slightly more interesting for a limited time and then went back to the old style...Tatooine.<br>
<br>
So with all that said and thinking that no more could be done, man was I wrong as were we all that aren&#146;t play testers that it...Endor reared it&#146;s ugly, Speeder Bike infested, Ewoks...Ugh! most likely one of the most useless races in the history, granted some have a &quot;boon&quot; somewhere but not in my opinion...Endor did however bring some great effects..Insurrection/Imperial Arrest Order, Battle Plan/Order and more - these were the starting backbones of most every deck out there nowadays...and everyone had them in their deck, I mean for the IAO/Insu. you killed Nabrum/Elis, you got better forfit for your wimp guys, and you could pull out Docking Bays...well that wasn&#146;t that usefull but still somewhat needed at times to get from place to place, because of the killed Nabrum/Ellis, but alas people started walking...and walked they did between Endor and Tatooine (cause everyone loves that planet right) and so they did over and over and over...Endor also brought out some new Starting Interrupts, granted that was in JP when the first one happened but this new allowed you to pull another battle ground or two unique ones from the SE set...how @#$%in&#146; is that... Well people made their decks and went about their happy little lives...and so on and so forth....The game hit a lul and people started leaving again, but what, why and how come...because everything&#146;s been done, apparently if you didn&#146;t have the hot cards you weren&#146;t gonna win, or you couldn&#146;t do what  you wanted because you came into the game late and couldn&#146;t afford 5.00 for a pack of WB Premiere to try and get that precious Darth Vader or Obi-Wan Kenobi, granted you could buy the Enhanced Characters, which were a great thing, but still...was it really necessary...yeah! and So decipher again thinking in their infinte wisdom, made REFLECTIONS---- the best thing in a while....<br>
<br>
Reflection, brought back all the good stuff, foilized and made other things in the deck so that all someone had to do was shell out a $5.00er and get 18 cards of which you could pull more than 1 rare and guaranteed at least one FOIL, unless your me where you get one pack w/no foil and then one w/2 foils...go fig. So anyhow people started coming back, not for the CCG to play, they did however, but for the SHINY&#146;s - now Endor started this trend but the FOILS there sucked and people didn&#146;t like getting FOILS of cards that they allready had and didn&#146;t use, at least now they got a chance of getting some usefull cards that were FOILed...&quot;editors note: WHERES THE DAMN GARINDAN FOIL&quot;...and so people came back...and to their suprise...they liked what they saw...and along w/other Enhanced cards and Anthology, and OTSDs... and ofcourse MARA JADE Mmmmm good stuff...the next installment of Star Wars came out...<br>
<br>
DEATH STAR II - the most sought after set in the game, a stand alone or a relative helper, bringing in yet another Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight &quot;editors note: I need one&quot;, the Emperor Palpatine, and finally another version of Lord VADER - Great stuff...it also brought the game back to the more &quot;movie&quot; self and made some of the old players come back into the game that have left, and with that the best set out there today...Thankfull that Decipher didn&#146;t make FOILS of these cards, however, they are making a Reflections II, but who know&#146;s what&#146;s going to be in there...as for D*II it brought out the greatest Starting Interrupt of the day...Prepared Defense/Heading For The Medical Frigate, start w/3 Effects, immune to Alter, and deploy on the table...no problem...It also made more use of at least for the Dark Side, Insurrection, combining that with Mobilization Points to make the Dark Side FASTER (like they needed that) and brought some much sought after ability 4 characters for the Dark Side (now if only the Light Side could compete - They can it&#146;s just hard STILL) but along w/D*II came some more fun stuff...and some more space for Dark Side, but light side got a boost there...w/Wedge Antillies, Red Squadron Leader in his Ship, with another Rogue or Red Squadron person that made space that much more powerful to cancel a destiny that&#146;s 2 good...and thankfully that was needed especially w/Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, you get 7 ability out, cancel a destiny and beat down your opponent...Lightside finally got a equality of the Executor from Dagobah, with Home One and made Space a little more fair for Lightside....actually Lightsides best strategys are usually space oriented, but again that&#146;s my opinion. As for that and things said people started playing and playing hard and enjoying themselves...trying to convert Vader or Luke. But alas and finally said Decipher brought out the latest &quot;enhannced&quot; product...Official Tournament Jabbas Palace Sealed Deck...and what did that do.<br>
<br>
It brought us back to TATOOINE...WOOHOO!!! finally, bet you thought that I forgot that huh...Well as it stands...Tatooine is the place to be, albiet w/the Emperor and Overseeing It Personally or Mains and Toys w/Aliens beat down...The game is only going to get better, and better...and with the new RII coming out the game will be that much more fun... I personally can&#146;t wait for the big stuff to happen and then the game goes towards the books an follows that trilogy, what more could you ask for from the creaters of Star Wars...but<br>
<br>
MORE STAR WARS...just as long as you keep it streamlined and don&#146;t over balance one or the other it will be, and always will be the BEST CCG on the market.<br>
<br>
Well, now that your sleeping I will say goodnight, and hopes that you enjoyed my little history down amnesia lane...<br>
Take Care, God Speed, and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.<br>
