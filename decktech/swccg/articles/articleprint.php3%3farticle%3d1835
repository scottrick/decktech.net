NONE. I&#8217;m in Korea. I haven&#8217;t seen a Star Wars card in almost 3 weeks, much less played a game. I&#8217;m out of the loop. Although, if you&#8217;re really desperate, you could wait till you&#8217;re halfway through a game during the Championships and suddenly point behind your opponent and shout, &quot;LOOK! Isn&#8217;t that Mark Hamill?!?!&quot; Then when your opponent whirls around to look, you could just grab about 20 cards from his reserve deck, and stuff them down your shorts. Then again maybe not. You might enjoy the thought of a few &quot;choke&quot; Vaders hanging out in your boxers.<br>
<br>
I&#8217;m not &quot;jonesing&quot; for a game like I thought I&#8217;d be. I figured by now I&#8217;d be grabbing Koreans off the street, dragging them into my apartment and shoving 60 cards into their hand and trying to teach them through sign language or something. (&quot;No-no-NO! Force drain! FORCE DRAIN!&quot;) It would take sign language, because, and no offense to the Koreans, but their language sounds something like this: &quot;Huah, chinoko no desu sah oh oh, mmm, igo hanah su wah...&quot;. At least, that&#8217;s what it sounds like. Of course I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a wonderful language, it&#8217;s just that I have the slight difficulty of not understanding a single word of it. Naturally it&#8217;d be difficult to teach Koreans Star Wars, considering the frustration I&#8217;ve had just trying to teach it to some Americans. Perhaps I should&#8217;ve spoken Korean to the Americans who didn&#8217;t get it, maybe they would have picked up the game. (&quot;No-no-NO! Hamchi wa! HAMCHI WA!&quot;) Anyways, I&#8217;ve been too busy getting settled in here to worry about Star Wars anyway. Getting an apartment, looking for a car, staggering around from bar to bar downtown with a bunch of British ex-cops from Hong Kong dressed as monks, finding out where I work, you know, the usual stuff you do when you move to the other side of the planet. It&#8217;s simply left no time to worry about Star Wars, much less actually update an editorial or anything.<br>

Somebody asked me who&#8217;s gonna win the World&#8217;s this year. This, people, is simply something you cannot predict. Oh, I know, there are players out there with a strong chance of winning (I keep hearing something about Yavin 4 having some good players, Clint Lewis and Steven Hays, or somebody like that), but when it boils down to it there&#8217;s still that huge double factor of randomness and luck. (Or luck and randomness, depending on whether you&#8217;re dyslexic or not). Not only will the randomness of the initial pairings have a lot to influence who wins and who loses, but there&#8217;s other things as well. What you draw as your starting hand. What your opponent draws as his starting hand. How much sleep you got the night before. How much alcohol your opponent drank last night. Whether it was Coors Light or Budweiser. How badly that Hungry Hombre Hearty Heat &#8217;n&#8217; Eat Bean Burrito that you wolfed down for breakfast is affecting you. So you see, all the little things will combine to make predicting the winner impossible, except for the fact that it won&#8217;t be YOU, so you shouldn&#8217;t even bother going. Just kidding. Go to DecipherCon, there&#8217;s plenty of other stuff to do besides get your head handed to you in the Worlds. Just like last year, I&#8217;m sure Decipher will have all kinds of wacky tournament formats, such as the Ironman Format, the No-Such-Thing-As-Luck Format, and the Let&#8217;s-See-How-Well-You-Play-With-Five-Rabid-Gerbils-Racing-Around-In-Your-Underwear Format. All of them great fun, although the guys from Yavin 4 seemed to appreciate the last format in particular.<br>
