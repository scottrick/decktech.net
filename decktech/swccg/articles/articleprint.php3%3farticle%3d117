Decipher responded to the force choke aspect of the objective with an errata.  After a short decline in use, hidden base once again became very popular with the X-Wing swarm.  Endor produced one of the most powerful anti cards ever in Security Precautions, but Hidden Base is still played.  Why?<br>
<br>
The most powerful game text is on the front side of the card.  You start with RendezVous Point, one of only two safe 2-0 icon locations (Wars not Make One great).  You can leave it for activation or you can use the excellent deploy -2 for your starships.	One particular deck starts Haven on the RendezVous point so that you can deploy Corvettes for free and then move them to Endor for free.  You can get your entire fleet to Endor for free, giving you many options from there.	Even with the traditional X-Wing swarm, X-Wings deploy free and can move all the way to parsec 6 with RPoint.  You can hyperspeed to Kessel with a hyperspeed 3 from the RPoint, making profitable Kessel Runs with Corvettes possible and safe.<br>
<br>
The front side also says you can deploy one system from your reserve deck every turn.  That my friends is amazing.  Now you can thin all of your 0 destiny locations out of your reserve deck and setup your drain systems (Kessel, Kiffex, and Coruscant) or get excellent activation.  If you need a particular system for Celebration, Kessel Runs, Our Most Desperate Hour, or The Planet That It's Farthest From, you can use Hidden Base to find any system you need.  While most people go for the drain systems and flip, Hidden Base is one of the best deck accelerators around.  You could use Hidden Base in a choke deck and use Force restrictive systems (Clakdor VII, Alderan etc) for a massive force advantage or even force choke deck.  One of the most intersting ideas using Hidden Base is for Asteroid Sanctuary.  Hidden Base takes one of the requirements away(the system for the asteroids) for the Sanctuary.  The deck isn't hurt by the flip either as you can still deploy sectors, just not systems.  While the drain deck is held back by the max drain of 1 at systems on the front side, the deck accelerator is inhibited by the inability to deploy systems on the flipside.  The Sanctuary deck is inhibited by neither.<br>
<br>
<br>
Flipping hidden base has some great advantages but it can have some serious consequences.  The first part is canceling two force drains per turn if you control two battle ground systems.  This is very good if you are playing an X-wing swarm or Hidden Haven.  These decks can also use TPTIFF, Rebel Fleet (not Hidden Haven), and It's a Hit to potentially shut down all of the DS drains.  Add in solid drains at the big three systems and you can easily win a drain race.  The LS can get huge amounts of power for very cheap.  Power 6 X-Wings with Organized Attack and S-Foils for 2 deploy and Corvettes for the cost of movement is much better than expensive Dreadnaughts or Star Destroyers.  Fighting the swarm isn't a good idea.<br>
<br>
The flip side of Hidden Base also has the single greatest manipulation feature in the game, forcing the opponent to use 1 force to draw 1 card.  This cuts the opponent's draw capacity in half.  This is powerful if you flip with a manipulator.  Shasa Tiel and oola are excellent under this environment.	Not to be underestimated, this feature prevents your opponent from drawing up to lower your differential.  Some X-Wing swarms play the Dagobah system and the Swamp so they can sink their X-Wings at the end of the game to boost their differential.	Plus Traffic Control allows you to dump your hand whenever you want to and Figurin D'an can get back your entire Lost pile.  this is the best part of the flip side.<br>
<br>
The final aspect of Hidden Base is the dangerous one.  Probing.  Hiding your hidden Base is really an art.  You can either bury it in alot of systems and hope your opponent is unlucky, you can put it at a heavily guarded system and use Rebel Barrier to beatdown, or you can put it at a strategic system, such as a force restrictive system such as Alderan.  Almost every competitive deck plays Security Precautions and this can cause serious force loss.  I'd suggest either playing It Could Be Worse to cancel the damage or playing many systems and having a good way to cause attrition (the Falcon) because battle damage won't matter.  You may want to put multiple of more than one system in your deck so you can change you hidden base from game to game.<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of in terms of this objective.	Good Luck and may the force steer opponent's ships away from your Hidden Base.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
