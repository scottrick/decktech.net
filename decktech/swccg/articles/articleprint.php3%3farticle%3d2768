They?re key to winning almost every deck. A Force Drain is simple, at each location you control (having total ability of 1 or more where your opponent does not)<br>
during your control phase; you may Force Drain there. To do a Force Drain, first announce where you are making your drain, and your opponent will lose Force equal to the number of Force icons on their side of that location plus any applicable modifiers if they are unable to cancel it in some way. <br>
<br>
A common Newbie FAQ:<br>
What is Force Draining?<br>
<br>
Quoted from Decipher: ?The whole purpose of Force Drains is to create dynamic tension between the Dark and Light Side players.? <br>
<br>
This makes you need to react to your opponent and stop his or her drains if his drains are more than yours, such as 6-5. Decks that have the goal of just draining reach something like this, called a drain race, where contact with the opponent is dangerous and both players decide to keep draining each turn. This is usual with some decks, but what about the decks where you&#146;ve got to take action? There are two main choices: <br>
1. Diminish your opponent&#146;s Force drains <br>
2. Enhance your own. (This will be covered in Chapter IV)<br>
<br>
The most common and probably the easiest method to eliminate a drain, at least for awhile anyway, is to take control of the location away from your opponent. This is simply done by getting presence there yourself. Most of the time, you would probably want to deploy a comparable army to what your opponent has so you won&#146;t get clobbered in battle while<br>
doing this. This means that you both ave presence, so there?s no way to drain. But sometimes just one character will be logical to pt down, if you need to stay there and<br>
evade his battles, such as Defels and Chief Retwin. If you deploy a strong enough force and battle and eliminate all of his characters at the site, you take control of that location and when it?s your turn, you can drain him, unless he deploys to that location. <br>
<br>
Another popular way to prevent drains is with the use of undercover spies, this is most used with teh Objective, ISB Operations / Empire?s Sinister Agents, from the Special<br>
Edoition Set. There are many spies in the game and both sides of the Force have the ability to make these characters undercover, with the use of an effect of the same name. The<br>
effect Undercover plays on your spy and then it gains certain special abilities, one of which is preventing your opponent from draining you where it is located. See this card?s text at Decipher?s Webpage. <br>
<br>
And some characters, like Arica and Boushh, even have the undercover effect built right in their text. Using undercover spies in this manner can be very helpful, but they&#146;re annoying to your opponent, and that makes them prime targets. Your opponent can respond to them with any of numerous cards out there that can either break-cover or dispose of undercover spies: Lt. Pol Treidum, Double Agent, Nevar Yalnal, Yarkora(s), Revealed/Hutt Smooch, Trample, and Sniper/Sorry About The Mess are a bunch that could give your spies a tough time. Beware.<br>
<br>
There are also a variety of interrupt cards that you can use to cancel a Force drain. They include Control (for either side), It Could Be Worse, Counter Assault/Surprise Assault<br>
and a few others. Get to know these cards. Some are lost when played and have a low destiny, others are balanced by counter cards specially designed to handle them, and there<br>
are those that only help under the right circumstances. <br>
<br>
Although technically they are not interrupts, effects such as Bargaining Table/Den of Thieves, Entrenchment/Strategic Reserves, and Rebel Fleet/Dreaded Imperial Starfleet<br>
have gameplay features similar to the interrupts I&#146;ve mentioned. They allow a drain to be cancelled by placing the specified card on them. However, they only are really effective in decks with plenty of the appropriate non-unique cards, and each only allows one cancellation per turn. <br>
<br>
Finally, there are cards that affect multiple drains, but these usually are more difficult to pull off and keep in play. The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From/A Bright Center To The Universe can eliminate drain modifiers and even the first Jedi Test- Great Warrior can cancel bonuses. These rely on certain strategies and deck types. Also relying on a certain deck type is the popular card, A Gift, which can reduce each of your opponent&#146;s drains by one if you can set it up and if the situation is prime. Some objectives are popular too, making drains range from being reduced to being very costly. Again though, they need the right situation. <br>
<br>
Here are some tips newbies might want to know about Force Draining:<br>
<br>
1. Each character can only be used in a force drain once per turn. This means that a character that drains at Tatooine: Mos Eisley may not move to Tatooine: Jabba?s Palace<br>
ie. Elis Helrot, Nabrun Leids, etc. then drain there. In which case, a deck full of Elis Helrot, a character with a non built-in lightsaber and locations could move from location to location draining. This is illegal.<br>
<br>
2. Draining for 0 at some locations can give you a bonus itself, such as with Jabba The Hutt?s game text bonus. This is an overlooked tip.<br>
