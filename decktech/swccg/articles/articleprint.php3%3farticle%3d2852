I thought she was joking at first, but as it turned out she was dead serious. I play on average 2 tournaments per month, also I have friends around regularly to play and Illiyana wanted to get involved so she spend more time with me, after all it was Illiyana who encouraged me to get back into the game at the beggining of the year because she saw how much I missed it. Anyway that&#146;s another story, this article is, based on the process I went through, teaching Illiyana the game, from the very basics to where she is at now. It is also a guide to those who have taken a Padwan under their wing, the steps and the patience required to train a Padwan into a Jedi Knight.<br>
<br>
STEP 1 (Introduction to the game)<br>
As most of you well know, Star Wars is not an easy game to teach in one hit, this is why I planned on gradually introducing Illiyana to more and more of the game slowly over time. <br>
The first thing that I did was send Illiyana home with a current rule book, and asked her to read it through a few times and get an understanding for the phases. She came over the following day, she had the phases memorised, so gave her one card of every different card type, and sent her home to read the rules again and get a feel for the card types, promising her that once she had completed that task, we could begin playing the game.<br>
The next time Illiyana came around, before the cards came out, I tested her on the phases, then on some icons and card types, the progress was astounding. So far my theory was correct. Little by little is the best way to teach a player and also develop good habits.<br>
<br>
STEP 2 (The first games)  <br>
Illiyana&#146;s excitement about playing her first game turned into an anti-climax, as I pulled out two 40 card decks that I had constructed specifically for the purposes of teaching her the basics. The decks consisted of lots of locations, characters, and starships. There were no other card types, as I said, little by little, and it was working, except Illiyana&#146;s patience was finding it hard, but we worked around that. After a few games, I incorporated weapons into the game, then effects, then interrupts, and so on, until we had two 60 card decks. The other puropose of the 40 card decks was to introduce the phases without having so many things to remember, and I must admit, Illiyana was remebering the phases perfectly, and she had also learned the basics of the game rather well. Things like ability 4, drawing to 12 cards, and the surprise for me was that she had even learned the basics of tracking. All good signs, but this was a dangerous time, where too much information can result in a brain overload. In order to ensure this did not happen, over the next two weeks, I refused to teach Illiyana anything else, until I felt she had absorbed all of the basic information and was ready to go on to the next step in her training.<br>
<br>
This concludes the first part of this three part series, for all those who are currently teaching a new players or plan on teaching someone, here are just a few tips to aid the training process:<br>
<br>
1. Always start with the basics, simplification is the best method to aid understanding.<br>
2. Do not bombard you&#146;re apprentice with information, be patient.<br>
3. Slowly but surely, never let the Padwan set the pace, but don&#146;t rush things.<br>
4. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Don&#146;t be a hard taskmaster, have fun, and remember there is a balance between a fun game and a serious game.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope that this is of some use to the many experienced players out there, as well as any new players reading through for ideas. Illiyana commented on the fact that the begginers have been forgotten about on decktech. The begginers of today are the experienced players of tomorrow, we need them to keep our game going.<br>
