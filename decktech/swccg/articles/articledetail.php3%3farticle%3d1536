<br>
  Most of us know that when we go to a tournament that we are only going to face several different deck types not a huge multitude and we also know that we could cruise decktech for hours looking at every single one of those decks and making a defence based on what you see. But also to mention are the less informed bigger base of players that know nothing of these decks and have not a clue on how to defend against them.<br>
<br>
  To get to the beef of the article there are only a few decks that you are really going to get matched up against. The ls decks that you will MOST likely see are: EBO, Profit, Obi/Tosche, Any kind of force choke deck with the dominance of TRM, MWYHL (fakout, test 2, and test 5 or 6) HB (fakout with celebration, OMDH or space) now these are what i have found to be popular but this is pertaining to region u may live in a region where numbers is huge (less so with the release of D*2) but these are the major archetypes i can think of. If you can think of any that i forgot please dmail me.<br>
<br>
  Now on to how to beat or stand up against these decks. I will start with ebo, this deck focuses on huge drains to wipe you out, and with the release of the 3rd anthology its speed increased so much that it scares the piss outa me. But that does not mean that there is no way to counter it. Far from the most common way to stop EBO is by seting up imperial decree (or starting it) and then establishing a strong hold on 2 systems and a site or hanging on to 2 of their hoth sites then u can either hang back and let their diminished drains hurt you and drain them out or go to space and duke it out some highly recomended starships are bossk in hounds tooth, zuckuss n mist hunter, dengar in punishing one, boba fett in slave one, death squadron star destroyers, executor, visage, and chimera. Thats pretty much it but dont try to beat them off the ground as it is a waste of time and resources.<br>
<br>
  Now on to profit, this is a hard deck to play against in the hands of a good player because it has excelent qualities, retreaval, and direct damage being the major 2 that stand out. But this ca be turned into a weakness some players that use this deck may come to depend on the retreaval too much and if you can block this off their deck will start to falter. There are 3 possible ways to do this you can use come here you big coward if you deem your fighting force strong enough to beat them off of 2 battlegrounds, secret plans if you can deny them force and make them use the little force they have for other purposes (draining/deploying characters) and then there is just simply holding the audience chamber so that they cant get acess to han, but if you try this method beware of leia freeing han by using somebody who loves you. Now on to the question of whether you should start aliens or not there are several good choices among them but it really comes down to whether or not you think you can keep them from killing those characters if you do start characters the wisest choice is to probably move them out to jabbas palace for that steady drain of 2, but there is something to remember to help you decide this if you see them using the jedi pack han (hes an alien with no game text) you should never use aliens because of an unwitting trap that you will in most cases will fall into. In my opinion the best too use is probably come here you big coward because it forces them to spread thin and if you have powerfull enough fighting forces you can easily wip them into shape. But reallisticly it depends on what you play for example most players will go with secret plans because they have to wait a long tikme just to pay for the retreaval but this is going to depend on how much force you give your opponent. Anyway i have babbled long enough so i will move on to the next deck.<br>
<br>
  The next deck i will go through is Obi/Tosche deck. This deck relies on huge force activation on the second to 3rd turnd to gather a force of mains to pummel you if you can do something to slow this down then you will be in a good position you can do this by barriering (if possible) the obi they will in most cases deploy to the hut first turn and then move over. Another thing you can do is start bad feeling have i, this may slow them down if you dont give them any force your first turn. The last and probably best way to deny them the force they depend on is by establishing a strong presence at the tosche station early in the game because their txt is cancelled if you occupy that site. From there on use as little sites as possible so that you dont give them a big amount of force and set up a fairly secure force to drain there. And those are the best ways i know to counter a deck like that, but one thing to keep in mind is that most of the time these decks use audience chamber and jabbas palace and can convert either of those should u use it for a starting location.<br>
<br>
  The next deck is a force choke deck with the most popular one the TRM (throne room mains). Once again another deck that releis on heavy force activation to overcome any opposition, but there is a twist to this type of deck it gives you almost no force! There are several ways to counter this among them the most popular presenc of the force to give you more icons, spies to invade their sites and drain, and bubo to kill nudjes that deny you force and one not so popular method of using image of the dark lord since this is primarily an attacking deck. But there are some cards that can improve the theme of denying you force that remains somewhat strong today this deck uses revolutions to either give them more activation or give them a site with a healthy drain ranging from 2-3. Some counters for that are come here you big coward and the almighty revo killer evader. And that is about all i can think of for that deck archetype except to remind you that bad feeling have i will not do you that much good here.<br>
<br>
  Now on to MWYHL (mind what you have learned) the jedi training objectve. I will first delve into the jedi training part of this objective (non fakeout). There is the test to 2 which just sets up 2 jedi tests that are going to help them win in battles and win in a drain race all you can really do against this deck is kill luke off because since the objective is not flipped the jedi tests will subsequenly be lost. Then there is the powerfull (but slow) test 5, when playing this deck just win as many battles as you can and drain for as much as possible befor they flip, after they flip play defensive and watch out for suprise asaults u can also screw up their tracking by omni boxing their reserve befor they draw destiny for test 5 but after it is on table, most of the time this will lose the game for them since they will be depending on a 6 or 7 to help in every battle. Then their is the test 6 i have not played against this yet but as i look at it it seems that once they have completed that test you should probably run and drain/retreive as much as possible and not get mixed up in any battles jodo kast and grand moff tarkin with vader can be a great asset if you do decide to battle. Then there is the fake out MWYHL this will use dagobah to pull sites for activation and yoda to help with attrition. Once again image of the dark lord can be of great help as well as the beatdown of that muppet geezer. That is really all i can think of for that deck but remember to play defensive befor you know if its a training or fakeout otherwise you find yourself winning easely one turn and losing beyond bringing it back the next.<br>
<br>
  And the last deck i will look at in this lenthy article is Hidden Base. This deck may have seen a declne for a little whil after preimere but now after the release of D*2 you can expect more and more people to be playing this deck. There are not many ways to counter this deck other than security precautions and probing but watch out for it could be worse it can be a pain in the ass if you dont have an it's worse to use. Then there is the HB fakeout with celebration i have never seen one of these decks in action but i know they are out there and i know that they are good. Just try to beat them off of their sites if you see this deck then chances are you will have won the game if you can just hold out in space. The last kind of HB is very powerfull it uses mains to beat you off of the ground and then ships to haul ass in space and for retreival purposes adding to the benefits of their mains. The best ways to counter this is to set up a trap in either space or ground and thenbeat them once they have taken the bait you can do this using a weenie character and a ghhk then using a large assault force to bring the beats to them once they have commited cards. Just watch out for draw their fire/frozen assets combo it can hurt.<br>
