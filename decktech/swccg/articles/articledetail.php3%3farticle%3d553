<br>
So you&amp;#8217;re sittin here asking yourself this: Who the hell is this guy to tell me how to win worlds?  Well, I&amp;#8217;m going to begin by explaining why I&amp;#8217;m qualified to give you this advice and why you should listen.<br>
<br>
I began playing SW:CCG right after the release of Hoth.  It took awhile, but after about a year I became a dominant player in my local tournament scene.  By the end of the summer of 1998, I had earned my first trip to worlds by winning the Yavin IV Regional in Nashville, TN.  Due to a poor performance at my first Worlds, I not only had a craving to make a return trip, but I was determined to prove myself the next time I set foot in Virginia.<br>
<br>
Sometime in June of 1999 I had a dream about winning Origins(the first World qualifier of the year).  Being the kind of guy that I am I had to tell everybody, and pretty soon I was predicting a victory.  On July 4th, 1999, I came through in the clutch and won!  This sent me on a streak in which I lost 1 game in nearly 30.  My rating was soaring, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t inflated.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t staying home on the local scene.  I was traveling all over the place and beating the best of the best.<br>
<br>
About that time Worlds arrived.  I was the only player to not suffer a full loss on day 1, and I finished in 2nd place that day.  I was so close to my goal that it took a man who knew every single card in my deck and a good bit of luck to knock me off course.  I finished 5th which is very respectable.	Immediately after worlds my rating jumped to what is the 4th highest total ever achieved.<br>
<br>
If this information isn&amp;#8217;t enough to make you feel like I&amp;#8217;m qualified to help you, then you probably can&amp;#8217;t be helped.  Hopefully the opposite is true and you will listen carefully to me.  Hopefully I can help you make it to the next level.<br>
<br>
Enough about me, let&amp;#8217;s get to the meat of the article.  I&amp;#8217;ve broken this thing down into four categories: Flying Solo, The Buddy System, Tournament Play, Dedication and Determination, and Achieving the goal.  Each of these categories has sub categories, which I will identify and describe in detail.  Keep reading.	It gets better.<br>
<br>
The first thing you have to do is Fly Solo.  When you first start out in attempting to win worlds you are all alone.  Flying Solo is broken down into several sub-categories.  These are Deck Building, which contains Metagaming and Tech, Playing(solo SW that is), and Practicing.  Practicing can be broken down into analysis and correction.  While practicing isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily something you do on your own, its components are so I have included it here.<br>
<br>
So you&amp;#8217;re gonna build the deck to win worlds?  You have a lot of decisions to make.  Do you use an objective or no?  If so which one?  Do you go for the flip?  Do you play space or ground?	Do you play interrupt heavy or character heavy?  These are all tough questions that have to be answered.  I can&amp;#8217;t sit here and tell you how exactly how to build a deck.  But you need to ask yourself these questions about your deck.  Do I have enough force to be able to force drain (if battle order or battle plan is out), deploy, battle, move, and draw all in the same turn midway through the game?  Can I win by force draining?  Can I win by battling?  Can my deck win if the opponent shuts down my main strategy?  If you answer yes to all of these questions you&amp;#8217;re on your way.<br>
<br>
Now we come to the components of Deck Building.  These are Meta-gaming and Tech.  Meta-gaming is basically what&amp;#8217;s going around in your area or where you are planning to play.  What decks are hot?  What cards are hot?  This is known as the Meta-game.  Tech is what you put in your deck to combat this.	Is Hidden Base big?  Security Precautions is tech.  While it&amp;#8217;s not anything new it&amp;#8217;s still tech.  When you build your deck ask yourself what strategies could hurt you.  If you get some answers, then you need to add some Tech.<br>
<br>
What is playing solo?  Playing solo is the act of playing a game of SW:CCG by yourself.  In this game you are both light and dark at the same time and you are playing against yourself.  (Note: I have done this while sitting in a major gaming hall while waiting for friends to finish an Invitational Qualifier, so I know you can do it in the privacy of your own home)	This is an excellent way to see if a deck is worthy to go from the drawing board to the next stage in its life cycle.  Does the deck work right?  If not what needs to be changed?  Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to change 10 or 20 or even 30 cards in a deck.  Whatever it takes is whatever it takes.<br>
<br>
And now we come to practicing.	While you don&amp;#8217;t practice alone(this requires another play), you do analyze games and correct mistakes while alone.  When you play in a tournament or even a few fun games, take time to reflect upon the events of the day.  Did you win or lose?  If you lost, why?	What could you have done differently to win?  If you won, why?	What could you have done differently to win by more?  Try to Correct these mistakes the next time you play.  If you lost because you forgot to force drain, remind yourself to force drain.  If you lost because left a lone character to get hammered, then don&amp;#8217;t let yourself do it again.	You get the idea!<br>
<br>
Next we come to what I like to call The Buddy System.  That&amp;#8217;s right.	You&amp;#8217;ve graduated from solo star wars, and you have a buddy.  Generally the buddy will be near your same skill level with pretty much the same interests as you in life and star wars.  He will usually be a friend not only in star wars, but also in regular ole day-to-day life.  The Buddy System is broken down into three types of playtesting: fun games, casual playtesting, and serious playtesting.	Fun games are just what they seem to be.  These are games you just play for fun with no real purpose except to try out decks.  Casual playtesting consists of revising and refining.  Serious playtesting consists of tweaking and strategizing.<br>
<br>
Casual playtesting is simple.  This is the early stage of playtesting where you sit down and play your many decks against each other to see what works.  If a deck isn&amp;#8217;t working just right you revise and refine, making it a well-oiled machine.  When you are preparing for a major tournament this is the most crucial point.  This is the point that will determine which two decks you decide to play.	You should be very careful in this stage.  Consider the meta, consider the situation, consider everything.  There is a fine line between being right and being wrong.  You could win it all or you could go 3-3 and walk home with your ass in a sling.<br>
<br>
So what is serious playtesting?  This is a good question.  Most players never come close to participating in serious playtesting.  Most players think they are ready after casual playtesting.	So what is it?	This is the stage where you play the decks you intend to use against every other deck you expect to see.  You do this multiple times to get a better idea and to achieve consistency.  The reason you do this is so that you become more adept at forming a plan of attack.  If you&amp;#8217;ve played your light side deck against ISB ten times in playtesting, then you&amp;#8217;re more likely to beat ISB in a tournament than if you hadn&amp;#8217;t seen an ISB in testing.  You also get a very good idea of your deck&amp;#8217;s weaknesses.  If you can&amp;#8217;t hand a certain deck, you tweak your deck to give it a chance.  If you&amp;#8217;ve come this far then you&amp;#8217;re close to making the jump to the major leagues.<br>
<br>
So what do I mean by Tournament Play?  Well what the hell do you think I mean?	I mean playing in a tournament.  How do you do it?  There are four parts to this.  They are game play, luck factor, playing as a team, and attitude.  I&amp;#8217;m gonna save attitude for last because I believe it is very, very important.<br>
<br>
So what about game play.  This is huge.  While you can make mistakes and still win, you can&amp;#8217;t make them very often and they can&amp;#8217;t be too significant.  You have to remember all of the phases of a turn.  You have to execute all of the simple functions of the game.  You also have to execute on your game plan.  Once you&amp;#8217;ve assessed the opponent&amp;#8217;s deck, can you form the game plan and execute?	This is where serious playtesting will pull you through and make you win a game easily.<br>
<br>
So you wanna know about the Luck Factor?  What am I talking about here?  No, I&amp;#8217;m not talking about the hands your draw or your destinies early in the game before you can track.  I&amp;#8217;m talking about match-ups.  That&amp;#8217;s right.  Player match-ups and deck match-ups.  Lets face it.  No deck can beat every deck every single time.  If you get the good pairings your chances are increased immensely.  You can&amp;#8217;t do much about this except take what is given to you and make the best of it.<br>
<br>
What about playing as a team?  This is a strategy devised by myself and incorporated by team Nashville in multiple tournaments.  This strategy tries to thwart the Luck Factor.  What you do here is simple.  If you have a group of players playing in a qualifier, and they are all of fairly equal play skill, you all use the same decks.  Somebody is bound to get good match-ups right?  For sure.  This strategy worked wonders at Origins, and it did very well at Worlds this year with Steven Lewis and I placing 2nd and 5th, respective.<br>
<br>
Now to attitude.  Some may say you should just be a friendly guy and people will like you and you will have fun.  I say screw all that bull @#$% cuz that&amp;#8217;s exactly what it is, bull @#$%.  I&amp;#8217;m not telling you to not be nice, but you have to keep real.	When you go to a major tournament you&amp;#8217;re not there to make friends, you&amp;#8217;re there to win that trip or those sheets or whatever.  Your attitude should be confidence almost to the point of arrogance.  I&amp;#8217;ve found this to be the best way to go.  If you go into a game thinking you&amp;#8217;re gonna win, odds are you will.  Often times your opponent will notice your confidence and wilt under your indomitable will.  If you go in trying to be Mr. Nice Guy you&amp;#8217;re gonna get hammered.	The other guy that read my article will spank you because he&amp;#8217;s in the mind set of win, win, win.  He&amp;#8217;ll join the guys at worlds who are confident.	At worlds this year the people who made it to day 2 were all very confident players who expected to win.  And win they did.<br>
<br>
We&amp;#8217;re getting close.	Can you feel it?  Let&amp;#8217;s talk about Discipline and Determination.  This subject is huge.  You can&amp;#8217;t win without practicing.	Michael Jordan is the best damn basketball player ever to live.  But he didn&amp;#8217;t get there without these skills.  He practiced for hours every day to get better.  He was cut from his high school team, yet he was determined to persevere and persevere he did.  You have to play and play and play.	You have to play and play and play.  As good an example as Michael Jordan is, T.J. Holman is an equally bad example.  T.J. is one of the best players around but he didn&amp;#8217;t put the required effort forth this year.  He was too busy with other things, thus he didn&amp;#8217;t make it back to the promised land.  Don&amp;#8217;t follow in his footsteps.  Play, play, and play some more.<br>
<br>
What the hell do I mean by achieving the goal?	I mean achieving the goal dammit.  Winning the big one and going on to play for that plate.  To do this you have to perform on all cylinders.  Everything has to click.  If you do all the things I&amp;#8217;ve told you in this article then you will be in position.  All you have to do is capitalize.<br>
<br>
I hope this article has helped your game at least a little bit.  Hopefully you can put the pieces together and make a run at a regional or open this year.  Good luck to you all!<br>
