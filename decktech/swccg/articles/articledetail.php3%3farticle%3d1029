<br>
   Ok first off I know I am going to get a lot of people reading this article due solely to the fact that it is an article about the most infamous SWCCG player I know, notice I didn't say famous. If you know me, then I hope that your opinion of me is favorable, I am going to try to explain why I hang out with Clint and maybe change your mind as to the type of person he is. Second, please rate the article according to whether or not you think it is good and not just slap up a terrible rating because you don't like Clint, that is not how the ratings were intended.<br>
<br>
   On with the show. When I first started playing the SWCCG, Hoth had just been released, and I was a certifiable scrub. I took Stoormtroopers and Owen Lars to my first Tournament, and spent most of my time gawking at cards I had never seen and losing every game. It was at this tournament that I met Steve Lewis, this meeting would turn into a good friendship. If you know Steve then you probably have the same opinion of him as I do, he is just an all around good guy. I soon grew to love the game, and I still do, and took the next step to become a TD.<br>
<br>
    It was as a TD that I really got to know the player base in Nashville. I ran two tournaments a month and played the other two, usually having to go to Huntsville Alabama, or Cookeville Tennessee to play. I remember meeting a lot of people and watching their progression from newby, to scrub, to decent players.<br>
 It was this that led me to meeting people like Steven Turner and Clint. Steve Lewis and myself used to talk about which players were good and which ones were getting better; you know the scoping your potential opponents for strengths and weaknesses. We used to always talk about Steven Turner and I can't ever remember talking about Clint.<br>
<br>
     Clint was however one of the loudest people at my tournaments, especially when he would lose. Even then he took the game way to serious, and to be honest he wasn't that good. I used to always try and get him to calm down, and realize that it was just a game. I could tell right away when he was losing, because his face would get beat red. It was an indicator that Clint was about to blow his lid. I ignored most of his ranting and attributed most of it to the fact that he was 16. I was something like 25 and married and had seen the whole world, so what did I care if a 16 year old got mad at losing a game.<br>
<br>
     Steve and I started getting serious about the game, and that led to us travelling. By this time I was a decent player, and Steve was already the number one ranked player in our area. This was well before we really started hanging out with Clint. You see due to the fact that Clint was still a minor, his parents wouldn't let him travel. I remember asking him, because by this time he was getting to be a decent player. I used to try and get people to travel with Steve and I to help with expenses and to bolster the view that Nashville players would travel for the big games. I still think we have this reputation, although there are tons of guys who do this now. We would however see Clint at all the big functions. We went to Origins, and Clint was there, DragonCon, Clint. Our Regional in South Carolina, boom Clint was there, this was a really funny tournament to watch Clint. He took a Baragwins, Dagobah deck. I think it went time twice. That deck stunk if you remember. Clint was so mad, his face just stayed red.<br>
<br>
     I still didn't like Clint too much at this point, but I didn't dislike him either. I really didn't know much about him to have a good idea as to what kind of person he was. Then I joined the listserve, and man did my opinion of Clint drop, probably just like a lot of you. I think this is where the misunderstanding of Clint has its roots. Don't get me wrong, Clint is to blame for most of it. I used to see him at tournaments and get on him about how rude he was on there. I had seen him probably 50 times by then and had never seen him act in the arrogant way that I observed on the list serve. His answer was pretty much the same every time, he would tell me that he was just joking and that people didn't understand. I would laugh and tell him that if I didn't know him that I would think he was a jerk. This phrase would become a staple in my conversations with Clint over the next few years.<br>
<br>
     My relationship with Clint changed when he turned 18. His father relented and let him come on his first trip with Steven and I. I can't for the life of me remember where we were going. Maybe Clint or Steve can remember. I remember the trip was at least 5 hours. Stuck in a car with someone for 5 hours is a long time, and you can't help but get to know them better. I came to find out that Clint is a pretty spiritual person. Some of you are probably laughing at the moment, but he has a firm belief in God and was raised in a good home. He also has a strong moral foundation. This may not mean a lot to some people but to me, it means tons. I also found out that the arrogance displayed by him was mostly a front for an otherwise insecure guy. I guess it's not uncommon for an 18-year-old to have some insecurity, and it usually has a habit of manifesting itself in the form of arrogance or shyness. The more I hung out with Clint the more I began to like him. He really is a fun guy to hang out with and there was never a dull moment with him and Steve L. around. Things were really good until Origins last summer. This was a big transition for Clint.<br>
<br>
     Clint was still going strong on the listserve end and @#$%y as ever. He actually had the audacity to predict that he would win Origins. He and Steve spent the whole week getting ready for it, I on the other had was working full time and going to school, so I had very little time to test decks with them. I literally had to ask Steve if I had a certain card in my deck the first game of Origins. The funny thing about that tournament is that Clint actually managed to pull off the win. I began to notice a change in Clint.<br>
<br>
     I might have gotten a little ahead of myself, you see Clint had won the Nashville regional the year before and went to worlds, something that I have yet managed to do. But like a lot of folks, he got crushed by the now defunct Operative decks. Clint knew that he was good, but circumstances were kind to let him into the winner circle that day. The top two guys split in the last two games to knock each other out of the running, and left Clint to play a scrub that eked his way into the finals.<br>
<br>
     Back to the change in Clint. After the Origins win, Clint's ego swelled to new proportions. All of a sudden he was the best and no one could hold a candle to him. He went on an incredible run that summer and I think lost a total of two games in 5 months. He was instrumental in keeping our interest in the game to the point where we went to 6 regionals that summer. My wife was not at all happy with Clint, but with Steve's deck building and Clint's relentless play testing, I really leaped into being a better player. Clint on the other hand, was rapidly approaching a terrible reputation as a loud mouth arrogant punk. I guess I can say it because I truly consider myself Clint's friend, but it is true. I went out of my way to defend him, and try to explain to people that he is a lot better in person than what he came out to be on the listserve. Truth be told, he just had a lot of free time to kill, so he did it on the listserve.<br>
<br>
     I guess I started getting to the point that a lot of people are with Clint, you can only take so much of a guy telling you how good he is. Clint was a much better player than I was then and probably is now. It all came to a boil for me at Deciphercon last year. Clint did well, but Steve managed to do better. I metaed my way right out of playing at Worlds. Clint made a statement that he was better than Steve even though Steve had finished second. Clint kept going on and on about him being the best player there. It was really annoying. But I tended to overlook such things in Clint and shrugged it off to him joking. I can't remember if it was before or after Worlds last year that I actually blew up at Clint. We were play testing, and there was a question about a game. It was just a friendly game, in the bottom of Steve's house where we generally test. Clint kept arguing something. The basis for the argument was that Clint could not admit he was wrong. I got mad, picked up my cards and started basically letting Clint know he as being an @$$. I told him that it was behavior like that that made people not like him, and why Steve and I had talked about not hanging out with him anymore. Like I said before, you can only take so much arrogance from a guy before you just have to either cut strings or change things. I decided to change things.<br>
<br>
     Clint got real quiet around me after that, I could tell I hurt his feelings and made him do a little soul searching. It was probably 2 weeks later that I got a big I'm sorry from Clint. I can honestly say that he as been tons better since then. Well at least around me.<br>
<br>
     I remember reading a lot in the rumors sections here after we went to the Detroit Grand Slam. Clint had a temper tantrum. You see he is not used to losing, and if you have paid attention to his record over the Grand slams you would know that it is less then stellar. He made a really classless move and threw his box around at the Slam. Now this probably wouldn't have been noticed by lets say 99% of the players their, but we are talking about Clint, everyone noticed. Jon Chu and I talked about it, and I tried to cheer him up by telling him that everyone goes into slumps, I have several times. Clint really didn't get happy again till he came back from Denver. Since then he has been back to his old self.<br>
<br>
     I take issue with Clint all the time, and I am probably one of his biggest critics, but I am also one of his biggest supporters. I think he is way to mean and arrogant in forums like Decktech, and way to quiet when it counts, like meeting new people. I will wrap this up by saying a few things. First, don't take Clint so serious when he writes something stupid, yes stupid, about a deck your building. He really does know what he is talking about, although he could learn how to use some tact. Second, unless you have met him, try not to have a bad opinion of him, he is a fun guy to hang out with. Lastly, remember that we are all human, and that this is only a game.<br>
