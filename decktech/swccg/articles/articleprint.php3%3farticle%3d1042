<br>
Not all of your wonderful cards you play with will hurt your opponent and help you-some of them will work exactly the opposite, depending on the game....<br>
    What do I mean by double-edged swords? It's a term used when pointing out that something you think will hurt an opponent could just as easily hurt you. This applies to quite a few cards in the game, and they require serious thought as to their worthiness.  A simple example- Cloud City:Downtown Plaza. Two icons on each side, with no minuses in the text means whoever controls this site is hitting the opposition for two force. Now, YOU deployed it, 'cause YOU intended to drain that poor Light Side player of another two every control phase. But that Vader you're expecting to draw just isn't showing up...and EPP Luke is hitting YOU for two force. See what I mean? When playing with cards such as these, you need to be absolutely sure that they will hurt your opponent more than they hurt you.<br>
    The plaza was a simple example. Visage of the Emperor is another. Until you get Vader out, BOTH of you are losing force. Can you hang with this? For the most, you should be able to. Four or five Vaders in your deck, and it's a good bet Light will lose more from Visage than you. As part of a good Hunt Down deck(now fortified with 8 essential vitamins and minerals!) Visage is a worthy 'double-edged sword' to play with. Here's a great old-skool example of a double-edged sword: Presence Of The Force. Better make sure you can control whatever you put it on...<br>
    O.K., big deal, 2/2 sites and Presence. What about big ones? Probably the biggest game decider out there when it goes down, Epic Duel will either win or lose the game for you when you duel.  I don't care how many sixes and sevens you have in your deck, unless you set up your destinies and know what your opponent is holding, the duel can go either way.	Play a lost Monnok to see if Glancing Blow and/or Courage Of A Skywalker will ruin your day.  And if you don't have a Focused Attack in hand, you ought to wait.  Two other popular ones, although not as game-breaking, are First Strike and Draw Their Fire.  Unless you're trying to pull off a one-battle game ender, your own card can hurt you.  If you play with this, you need to keep your opponent on the defensive, and have a deck that plays offensively.  I would never use this card because my decks play defensively.  I use Moment Of Triumphs and Solo Hans, and let my opponent come to me.  Now, probably the two biggest used ones out there:  Battle Plan and Battle Order. Great concept. Keep decks balanced between ground and space. Slow down hyper-focused decks until you're ready to go. But sometimes they just don't work that way. Example: In a tourney about a month ago, I used two of my opponents cards to beat him. Visage and Battle Order. Playing a Tat. Celebration against his Hunt Down(he knows who he is...) he deploys Captain Needa on the Avenger at my Tatooine and Battle Order. Vader and a sick number of walkers were on my Tatooine sites. Battle Order at this point hurts me. I take the hit for a bit, then get the combo on him-Capt. Han, Leia w/Blaster, Falcon. Battle. Needa and Avenger are toast. Battle Order now hurts HIM as I'm regulating my planet with the combo, while Ben, Luke, and a number of assorted ability 4 aliens are running around on the ground. Celebration comes out shortly after that, and while we are both still losing to Visage, I'm retrieving. He's not. You see how this ended. Eventually Visage drained him so low he couldn't afford to drain me. He intended for Battle Order and Visage to hurt me, but they ended up killing him instead. This has happened more than once. Often with Battle Order/Plan, the 'hyper-focused' deck will knock off all presence on either the ground or space, depending on what the deck is focused on. After that, each player usually pays to drain 'til the end of the game, with few exceptions.  Whoever who has the massive force activation will have the advantage in this situation.<br>
   However, there is one deck in particular I'm thinking of that Battle Plan ALWAYS helps, not hinders. Mind What You Have Learned. It can be hard to survive to Test 5, but Battle Plan helps immensely.  It normally will take the DS a while to find what they need to fulfill the requirements of the card, and paying the three can only slow them down, giving you some breathing room.	Yes, they're still draining you, but they'll pay for it.  Keep in mind, I'm certainly not saying don't use the cards.  They can be devasting against an Operatives deck, and that alone is probably enough reason to throw them in.  But if you're not facing Ops, think twice about putting it on the table.  So, consider this before you casually throw it in. It can be very hard to occupy both space and ground sometimes...As for other double-edged swords, keep this article in mind next time you are flipping through your collection. You'll see them, and be a better player for it. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
