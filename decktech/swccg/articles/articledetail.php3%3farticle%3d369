<br>
Collector-  this is a person who only collects the cards and does not play...means exactly what it says.<br>
<br>
Newbie-  this is a player who has just begun playing the game and has very little cards and/or understand very little strategy and gameplay(usually has less than 20 tournament games)<br>
<br>
Scrub-	this is the type of player who just can seem to rise of newbie play skill even though he/she has well over 25 tourney games<br>
<br>
Veteran-  the guys who have played a long time and cant seem to get that rating up into the elite level<br>
<br>
World Finalist-  this is of course a player who has been to the World Finals<br>
<br>
***Author's note<br>
   There are several stages of evolution that I have not clearly defined here.	I will bring those about in more detail a bit later in the article.  One of these comes between collector, newbie, and scrub.  The others all come between the scrub level and the world finalist level.  These levels of evolution are a bit difficult to name with one word and it will be easier to describe them giving examples.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let me get into the meat of the article.  How can one go from being a newbie to being a World Finalist?  Just so you know it is very possible...look at how many people have already done it.  While it is very possible, it is highly unlikely to happen to just anybody.	This is evidenced by looking at the tournament ratings page on Decipher's website.  The last time I checked there were over 25,000 players registered in Decipher's system and only around 100 or so World Finalists from the four years of Worlds.<br>
<br>
So what am I waiting for?  Let's get to the stages of evolution in the 'career' of a star wars player.  The first stage is very obvious.  That is the stage of the Collector.  The collector doesn't really have an interest in playing the game, thus there is little chance for him to ever progress.  Sometimes this guy will come out of nowhere and surprise by jumping into the game full force.  This isn't all that hard for him to do, because he/she generally has all the cards in multiple(at least the serious collector's do).<br>
***Note<br>
   Many players skip the Collector phase and jump right into the next stage which is....<br>
<br>
That's right.	The Newbie stage comes next.  The newbie is generally a person who has just recently been introduced to the game.  This person will have very few cards and values each and every main they possess like it was gold.  And to them it is.  These players rarely know all of the rules and at times seem as if they will never rise out of the hole they are in.<br>
<br>
Now I will discuss to help Newbie's and how Newbie's can help themselves.  For you veteran players, it is sometimes difficult to help newbies in their experience.  I, and many others, have gone into tourneys and crushed newbies in order to boost my differential to give me a better chance at winning the tourney.  This is not the way to go.	Give the newbies a chance, explaining to them when certain plays are not wise.	When you have a chance to crush a lone character such as a rebel trooper or even an EPP, don't do it in mass.	Drop enough to draw a destiny and attrit his guy away.	This will teach him not to leave guys alone just as well as the 40 point beatdown.  After games it is often a good idea to request to look through this players deck and give him pointers(and if you're feeling extra generous maybe a few extra rares from your trade binder).<br>
<br>
Now to my advice to newbies.  Play, play, and play some more.  When there is a tournament go to it.  Even if you do poorly you will receive prizes just like everybody else.  You might just get lucky and the TD will heap piles of packs for the last few players(this is common in my area).  Don't just do it for the packs though.  What you lack is experience and you need it very much.  The more you practice, the better you get.  Soon enough you'll be competing with the Veterans.  And on to aquiring cards.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen new players go to the counter of the local comic store and buy 1 or 2 packs from each expansion.  This is a horrible idea guys.  You're much better off buying boxes of an expansion than packs.  You have better odds of getting good cards.  Don't buy packs...if you're gonna buy cards buy boxes or...singles.  That's right.  Try to find a place where you can buy those mains relatively cheap.  For those of you who are young and don't have much money...do what I did.  Go hungry when you can and use that lunch money on cards.(Rating: 1500-1650)<br>
<br>
Next we come to a lesser known level of evolution.  This level contains people who don't play in tournaments.	They simply hang out at shops or wherever and play with friends for fun.  For you veteran tourney players...invite them to a tourney.  These are the people who will keep the game going.<br>
<br>
At last.  We have reached the scrub level.  These guys generally have a very tough time with deck building.  They are also inept when it comes to spotting deck types, and they are generally clueless regarding a gameplan to beat these decktypes.  At times it seems as if there is no way to rise up.  You always seem to go 1-3 or 2-2 if you get lucky and get the bye.  My advice to you is simple and along the same lines as that of my advice to newbies.  Play, play, and play.  Don't just play in tourneys though.  Try to find a local gaming night or a place where you can find people playing regularly.  Try to play as many games with the better players as you can.  Ask them questions during the games, such as, 'Why do you deploy here?' or, 'What would you do in this situation?'  Most players are willing to help.  If a good player gives you advice in a game, don't tell them you don't need it.  Obviously you do or you'd be going 3-1 or 4-0 and winning these tournaments.	The more you shun them, the less likely they are to offer help in the future.  Try to learn from good players' decks as well as playing styles.  It is not a bad idea to try to emulate them in the way you play.  The best advice I can give you is to not give up.  Keep trying!<br>
<br>
And now on to the Veterans.  These players have a better concept of deckbuilding than Scrubs as well as the ability to spot decktypes.	However, they still lack the necessary skills to develop a strategy or game plan to beat the decks they face.  This is a difficult level to climb out of.  Players often get stuck in this level for a year or so and then just fizzle out.  If you've been stuck here for a long time, you may be out of luck.  All you can do is keep playing with the best players.(Rating: 1650-1800)<br>
<br>
And now we get to a level that you just don't want to be in.  This is a level that I like to call the plateau.  There is an invisible barrier right around 1900 in the ratings system.  Very few players break this barrier.  Many have come close and many more will follow in their footsteps, but few will actually rise above this step on the ladder of evolution.  These players do very well in tournaments generally going 3-1 or 4-0, but they just can't seem to keep a streak going.  Every now and then they will go 2-2 and lose a considerable amount of points in the ratings.  These guys are generally not a threat in the big tournaments because they just can't close games out in the clutch.  They don't have that killer instinct.  Now don't get me wrong.  You can break out of this level.  It won't be easy, but it is possible.  The best way to do this(it worked for me), is to find an Elite player or a World Finalist and sort of buddy up to them.  Play them every chance you get.  Badger them for games.  Invite yourself over to their house to test decks.  It may not seem like the most polite thing to do at times, but trust me...it works.  And it may be the only thing that can propel you to the next level which is....(Rating: 1800-1900)<br>
<br>
Yup!  Elite players are the next level.  I will go into only one more level after this and it is the World Finalist level.  These two levels can be interchangeable at times to I may refer to them at the same time here.  Elite players know the game, they know the cards, they know decks, they can form gameplans, they have the killer instinct, the know how to win.  A huge difference in the Elite players and the World Finalist players is mistakes.  Now don't get me wrong, everybody makes mistakes.  But World Finalists make less mistakes than Elite level players.  The most noticeable aspect of this is the size of the mistake.  Elite level players will make mistakes that cost them the game, while World Finalist calibre players will rarely do this.  As an Elite player, you must be patient.  Your time will come.  Try to analyze all games to see what you could've done better if anything, so that you will better remember for the next time you are in a similar situation.<br>
(Rating: 1900+)<br>
<br>
And now to the best of the best.  The World Finalist level of players.	These guys are good.  These guys have every skill needed to win in this game.  They can build decks, they spot deck types well, they can form game plans against various opposing decks, they can track cards, they know the rules inside and out, they know every use of nearly every card, they are students of the game in every since.  But, you may ask, how are they any different from the Elite level player?  This is crucial right here.  This level of player knows that everybody makes mistakes.  And they wait for one to be made by the opponent.  When this occurs, the World Finalist level player makes the opponent pay.  The biggest difference between World Finalist players and Elite players is that World Finalist players will capitalize 95% of the time on their opponents mistakes.  Often times the opponent doesn't even realize their mistake until after the World Finalist has punished them for it.  These guys win the games that they shouldn't win.  They win games that should be auto losses due to deck matchups.  But they are very patient.  They wait, and wait, and wait until the right time and then they snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  They seem to always make the right play at the right time.	They have the killer instinct so much so that it almost makes them want to cry when they lose a tough game.  Another thing that seperates these players from the other levels is luck.	Its seems that these players have a huge amount of luck.  They always seem to be the luckiest guy you'll ever meet.(Rating: 1900+)<br>
<br>
Now none of these levels are set in stone.  Especially not the part where I've included ratings of each individual level.  The ratings are just a guideline.  They vary from region to region due to competition.<br>
<br>
Now that you know the levels of evolution in the 'career' of a SWCCG player, which one are you at?  Hopefully you can climb up out of it if you are near the bottom, and if you're near the top...good luck to you in staying there.  I hope to play you soon and give you a true test.  I hope I have answered any questions you may have about climbing the ladder, but if I haven't feel free to send me a private message and I'll try to respond as quickly as possible.<br>
