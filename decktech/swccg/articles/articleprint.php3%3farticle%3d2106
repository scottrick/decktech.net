I realize this article wont help everyone so please dont review it with I already know what these cards do. This is to help any and all people who dont know the cards well.<br>
Lets get started, shall we?<br>
<br>
Weapon of an Ungrateful Son - Dark - Cloud City<br>
Away Put Your Weapon - Light - Dagobah<br>
<br>
Used or Lost Interrupts<br>
<br>
Both are destiny 5<br>
<br>
Used: If a lightsaber was used to enhance a Force drain, place it in owners Used Pile.<br>
Lost: Place any of all of your devices and character weapons on table in your Used Pile.<br>
<br>
	The Used part of this card is rather useful. The most common Force drain enhancers these days are either Effects or Weapons. This card can be used numerous ways, to cancel Force drains, to get rid Vaders saber when you know the opponent is dueling. Maybe you just want to toss Maras saber to the Used Pile so you can battle her during your turn without worry about being hit or operated on by Dr. Evazan.<br>
	The Lost function isnt too shabby either. If you just want to boost your differently by one or two cards (sometimes it can mean the difference between 1st and 2nd places). Not too much to say about it though, its pretty straightforward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Takeel - Dark - Premiere<br>
<br>
Lost Interrupt<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
If both players just drew one battle destiny, use 1 Force to switch numbers.<br>
<br>
<br>
	I think this card can be really useful in Court of The Vile Gangster decks or any deck that utilizes Scum And Villainy. The downside is of course, is that its a Lost<br>
Interrupt. But with Court you can easily retrieve it for later use. Say youre battling your opponent and he draws a 6 to your 2. Use 1 Force to switch numbers, pretty good Id say. Some decks cant hang with taking down the mains, but attrition will do it. This card can be really helpful if you havent mastered the art of tracking yet and your opponent has. Now I realize that a lot of decks today use cards to draw multiple destinies, but this card should be able to earn a spot in your deck after some playing with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lost Relay - Light - Dagobah<br>
<br>
Used Interrupt<br>
<br>
Destiny 5<br>
<br>
Target one opponents starfighter present with one of your starships at an asteroid sector,before asteroid destiny is drawn this turn. If target lost this turn due to asteroid destiny, opponent also loses Force equal to targets forfeit value.<br>
<br>
<br>
	This card is a MUST in any asteroid decks. I have chosen this card mainly because of the (somewhat) resurgence of asteroid decks utilizing the new Watch Your<br>
Step objective. Personally, I think it can work, but it needs A LOT of fine tuning. Now, dont you hate those Bounty Hunter ships following you into the asteroids when youre trying to drain? But of course you do, what better way to make sure they dont interfere when you play this card on Boba Fett in Slave 1 or Zuckuss in Mist Hunter (especially since they reoccur with Scum...) So how about making them lose 4 for Fett or better, 5 for Zuckuss, I bet they wont bother you in the asteroids again too many times. This card is a great way for the Light side to deal out some direct damage of its own!<br>
<br>
<br>
Look Sir, Droids - Dark - Premiere<br>
<br>
Lost Interrupt<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
Use 1 Force to search though the opponents Use Pile and move any Droids you fine there to opponents Lost Pile. OR Use X Force to destroy any one droid on table where X= droids deploy cost.<br>
<br>
<br>
	This card was the first thing that came to mind when I saw the spoiler for the new Artoo &amp; Threepio combo card. They are widely use in Watch Your Step, You Can Either<br>
Profit By This, and most mains decks. Im sure you dont want a lonely IG-88 with Riot Gun escorting someone to get battled because of this card, nor do you want to not be able<br>
to draw battle destiny because of Artoo, I Have A Bad Feeling About This. Solution: Wait for you opponent to go searching for his AIHABFAT interrupt and then play the<br>
card, it becomes useless this turn unless he has another copy of the Droids in his hand. So you can then proceed to battle while still getting your destiny. This card is also very effective on: Artoo using a Gift, Leebos direct damage function, and R-3PO; ISBs worst nightmare :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Blast Door Controls - Dark - Premiere<br>
Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 5<br>
<br>
Deploy on your side of table. Cancels: Into The Garbage Chute, Flyboy; Narrow Escape; Blast The Door, Kid!; and Rebel Barrier.<br>
<br>
<br>
	This has to be one the greatest defensive Effects in the game. It cancels a lot of key light side cards such as Narrow Escape (in a lot of Profit decks) and Rebel Barrier (in almost all Light decks these days) and Blast The Door, Kid! which I have seen making its way back into tournament play with non-unique aliens in Agents in The Court decks. The downside, not Immune to Alter. But Im sure you can find some way to handle that ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Were The Bait - Dark - Cloud City<br>
<br>
Utinni Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 7<br>
<br>
Deploy on Han, Leia, or Chewie if capture of frozen. Target Luke. Luke may not attempt Jedi Tests. Also, during each of opponents draw phases, opponent loses 2 force (3 if captive is frozen). Utinni Effect canceled when reached by target.<br>
<br>
<br>
	Oh man. This card should be in EVERY Court deck. I mean, how many times have you captured Han or Chewbacca with someone like IG-88 with Riot Gun or Hidden Weapons? Im sure quite a few, I know I have. Remember, Luke doesnt have to be on table to be targeted by this Effect. Heres an example of this cards usefulness.<br>
<br>
Dark side is playing Court of the Vile Gangster. They have Might Jabba, Boelo, Ephant Mon, and IG-88 with Riot Gun at the Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
Light side has Ben Kenobi, EPP Han, and Chewbacca, Protector at the Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
Dark side initiates battle. After the just actions have been taken, Dark side fires the Riot gun and captures Han (only need a 3 to work). Dark side then plays Were The Bait. The battle then proceeds to swing in the Dark sides favor with 2 battle destinies and the Light getting 0 destinies. Should have cleared the site in attrition if not, Im sure theyll run away. Transfer Han to the Dungeon and its on. Only thing to watch out for are spies to<br>
allow Luke to get to the Dungeon, but with No Bargain it will cost more than a pretty penny. Not to mention using None Shall Pass (on the spy, if its a Rebel, usually Corran<br>
Horn and Tycho these days) Now the opponent is losing 2 during each of his draw phases. Thats gonna start to hurt. Consider this card for decks, especially all you Court<br>
lovers. Not that it matters, but its a 7 destiny.   :-P<br>
<br>
<br>
Krayt Dragon Bones - Dark - A New Hope<br>
<br>
Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
Use 1 Force to deploy on table. Each  opponents destiny draw, you do the following: (0) Put top used card in hand; (1) lose 1 Force; (2) activate 1 Force; (3) lose this Effect; (4) retrieve top lost card; (5) deploy a character for free; (6+) nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
	Well, Id say this is a perfect utility card for Court and other decks. Possibility of retrieval, free character deployment, and activation. Downside: you could end up losing Force. But then again, how many times has the Light side tracked 4s, 5s, and 6s? Quite a lot Im sure, as youve played against, and play in games. Always tracking for retrieval and battles. Sure the occasional destiny 1 main pops up, but thats what Scum and First Strike are for :-) Consider this card, it could prove to be useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
Smugglers Blues - Light - Dagobah<br>
<br>
Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
Deploy on a smuggler. May use 2 Force to cancel Limited Resources. Also, if trained by Rycar Ryjerd and piloting a starship when that starship completes a Kessel Run, Rycars Run, or The First Transport Is Away, any retrieved Force may be taken into hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
	This is a decent card if you can spare the slot for it and the Rycar Ryjerd Effect card. After completing Kessel and Rycars Run, in the Watch Your Step deck most<br>
likely, you can pick and chose which cards you want to go back to your hand. Maybe another Kessel/Rycar Run, Hyper Escape, Barrier, or whatever. Comes right back into your hand. Great card for the new objective.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eject! Eject! - Light - A New Hope<br>
<br>
Destiny 4<br>
<br>
Effect<br>
<br>
Use 1 Force to attempt to eliminate a starfighters permanent pilot. If destiny &gt;2, deploy on starfighter to remove permanent pilot. May now add 1 pilot. Must have pilot aboard to use power, maneuver, or hyperspeed. (Immune to Alter)<br>
<br>
<br>
	This is one of my personal favorites. Having trouble with that pesky Zuckuss in Mist Hunter? Well, deploy this Effect on him, draw higher than a 2 and boom, suddenly Zuckuss decided to jump ship.  :-) This card is REALLY good for ambushes and beatdowns. Say you got 5 Xwings in your hand and you really need to get rid of Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and his companion Dengar in Punishing One. Well, Dengar doesnt get destiny on his own and only ZiMH is holding you back. Use Eject!Eject! on ZiMH and voila! Beat Dengar like only his momma could. Lets see 5 X wings at 3 power each plus an Organized Attack most likely thats....20 power to his 4 I believe. 16 in overflow. Thats quite a lot. Great card...its earned a spot in most of my decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Logistical Delay - Light - A New Hope<br>
<br>
Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
Use 3 Force to deploy on opponents side of table. All opponents TIEs are deploy +1.<br>
<br>
<br>
If TIE decks are big in your area, I suggest you pack one of these, not only does it help prevent early drains, if you get it fast enough or Signal for it. It can also help when the opponent tries to overdeploy to beat down on one of your ships. Really helpful. Like I said, if TIEs are big in your meta, use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Advantage - Light - Cloud City<br>
<br>
Immediate Effect<br>
<br>
Destiny 4<br>
<br>
If you just won a battle or duel where an opponents character of ability &gt;3 was lost, deploy on one of your warriors involved. Warrior is power +2. During each of opponents move phases, opponent loses 1 Force (2 if character was a Dark Jedi). (Immune to Control)<br>
<br>
<br>
	Well, a Legendary Starfighter for your characters, how nice. :-)  This card works really well in dealing out damage. I mean, Dark side decks use plenty of characters of<br>
ability &gt;3. Sim, Janus, Vader, Bane, Jabba, Djas, Mara, and the Emperor, just to name a few. Win a battle against Vader, hacked him up a little bit. Deploy this and its 2 a turn for you buddy. Definitely going in ALL my Light side mains decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
R-3PO - Light - Hoth<br>
<br>
Droid<br>
<br>
Destiny 3<br>
<br>
Once during each of your control phases,  for each opponents spy present, opponent must lose 1 Force (2 if spy is a droid or Undercover, 4 if both).<br>
<br>
<br>
	This card is just freakin awesome. This card and turn an ISB deck inside and out. Especially the Probe Droid variation. This card hurts Mara, most ISB decks, and others.<br>
Definitely worth the slot. 4 Force loss just if they have an Undercover droid, 2 if theyre not Undercover, just watch out for Trample and Sniper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, thats it folks. I really hope you have learned something from this. Im just trying to spread some knowledge. Constructive criticism is appreciated. Please dont give me any I already knew this crap stuff. If you didnt enjoy it just hit BACK on your browser. What you might know as common knowledge, might be gold to a new player.<br>
