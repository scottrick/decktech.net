I was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and lived in Virginia Beach until I moved out after college.  So here?s the vital information you need to enjoy the nanoseconds at DecipherCon when you?re not playing.<br>
<br>
Part One:  How NOT To Get Ripped Off On Parking<br>
<br>
Okay, the best way to avoid this is not to take your car anywhere beyond your hotel parking lot.  In other words, if you?re going anywhere on the Oceanfront (Atlantic Avenue), you WALK.  For starters, parking in any lot generally can run you $10 or more.  For seconds, the parking meters do NOT work.  Trust me.  When the local paper runs an article about how they?re screwed up and the city admits to it, they?re really broken.  Expect to lose money if you try to use them.<br>
The good thing is that parking is much easier once you get away from the strip.  Many of the locations I?ll be talking about later will have free parking, although you will have to drive a bit to get there.  It?s worth it.  Parking is the biggest reason why locals don?t go to the beach down there.  Tourists wearing thongs like they?re a right rather than a privilege is the other one, although in November you may not have to worry about it.<br>
<br>
Part Two:  The Weather May Suck, Blame Decipher For Scheduling<br>
<br>
Weather in Virginia Beach in mid-November is anything but tropical.  Expect it to be cold, don?t think you?re going to be laying out on the beach, and make sure you find a hotel with an indoor, heated pool if you want that sort of experience.  This ain?t Orlando.  Virginia Beach has bathing-suit weather only from about late April to early October unless the ozone layer completely dissolves in the next couple of months.  Bring pants and warm shirts if you plan on being outside.  You may also get rained on, so be prepared for that too.<br>
<br>
Part Three:  It?s A LONG Way From Norfolk, Travel In Numbers (Single-File is Optional)<br>
<br>
The only way to fly into the area is by coming into Norfolk International Airport.  Southwest Airlines flies into there, and they have some fairly low fares and good service.  However?.it?s about an hour, depending on traffic, to get to the con site from said airport.  My best advice is to get in touch with other players and don?t get a cab unless you can fill it with people to make the fare less than painful (unless Decipher decides to run a shuttle, but that had questionable success last year).  If you know people that are driving down to the area, see if you can get them to pick you and your flying friends up.  I can provide directions on how to get to the hotel from Norfolk International (quickly) if anyone needs them, just drop me a D-Mail.<br>
<br>
Part Four:  Cruising, Curfews, and All Other Legal Crap<br>
<br>
This is just a quick primer on some of Virginia Beach?s stranger rules and regulations.  First off, ?cruising? is illegal and punishable by a fine.  If you pass the same point more than twice in 2 hours on Atlantic Avenue (?the strip?), you can get pulled over and ticketed.  I?m serious.  Secondly, Virginia Beach has a curfew for minors (the under-18 crowd) -  they can?t be out and about on the street after 11pm.  They will pick you up and try to call your parents.  Thirdly, like most cities, Virginia Beach has a ?Drunk Tank?.  If you?ve never been in one of these before, this is what it is ? a room in the jail where they leave all the drunks to puke all over themselves.  You may not get arrested and charged, but you WILL end up there.  So drink responsibly.  This city is really hard on underage and public drinking, and I don?t think you?d want to take your cards into a vomit-filled hellhole.  If you?ve never been to Virginia before, here?s the scoop on getting alcohol:  you can get beer and wine and a few things like hard lemonade and whatnot in the grocery stores and places like 7-Eleven until midnight.  They will NOT sell after midnight, don?t even bother asking.  If you want anything else (vodka, Kahlua, schnapps, etc?) you have to go to an ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control) store.  See directions below.  Much cheaper than paying hotel prices at the bar.<br>
<br>
Part Five:  Fun Stuff To Do Between Games<br>
<br>
Okay, here?s my personal list of great restaurants and fun things to do (complete with directions)<br>
<br>
Restaurants:<br>
<br>
1.  McDonalds and other fast food ? walk down Atlantic Avenue and you?ll find one.<br>
<br>
2.  Outback Steakhouse ? from the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Take Laskin Road, you?ll cross a major intersection called First Colonial Road.  Go through that intersection, Outback will be just a little further on your left.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
3.	Shogun (Japanese Teppanyaki &amp; Sushi Bar) ? This restaurant is AWESOME.  Great fun if you?ve got a group, the tables sit 10 and the chef cooks your food right in front of you.  From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Take Laskin Road to a major intersection (First Colonial Road).  Turn left onto First Colonial Road.  Take the first left you can (there?s a light) into Hilltop Square Shopping Center.  (There?s a Taco Bell near the entrance and a Super K Mark in the shopping center).  You?ll see Shogun across the parking lot.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
4.  First Colony Coffee House ? good for hanging out, great coffee and snacks.  From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Take Laskin Road and take a right turn into Hilltop North Shopping Center (there?s a light and an Otani Steakhouse on the right).  There?s a bunch of shops and an island of shops in the middle of the parking lot.  First Colony Coffee House is on the island.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
5.  Farm Fresh (Grocery Store) ? From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Just a little ways up the road you will see Farm Fresh on your left.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
6.  ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control) Store - From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Stay on Laskin Road, go through the big First Colonial intersection.  Take a right turn at the Kroger Plaza sign.  Meander around in that shopping area, near the Kroger itself you should see the ABC store.  They keep weird hours and may close as early as 6pm (but usually 9pm).  You will need two ID?s to buy anything and they are VERY strict about it.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
Cool Stuff:<br>
<br>
1.  Surf and Sand Movies 8 ? relatively decent movie theatre, although if you want stadium seating and stuff like that you?re going to have to go really far afield.  From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Take Laskin Road, you?ll see the theaters on your left.  (They are BEFORE the big First Colonial intersection that I mentioned earlier)  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
2.  LaserQuest Laser Tag ? used to be an Ultrazone, kinda kiddified now, but still fun.  The arena is three levels with ramps and is completely dark except for black light and booming music.  From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Stay on Laskin Road, go through the big First Colonial intersection.  Laskin Road will eventually merge into Virginia Beach Boulevard (you?ll see a ramp off to the left to get onto the interstate, do NOT take it) at another large intersection (Great Neck Road).  Go through the intersection, and a few more lights, until you get to another big intersection for Lynnhaven Parkway.  Turn left onto Lynnhaven Parkway and make sure you?re in the left lane.  You?ll cross over a set of railroad tracks.  Just beyond that is a little sign and a left turn for Dean Drive.  Turn left on Dean Drive, LaserQuest is just a little ways down and on the left.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
3.  Comic Alternative ? the local card shop if you don?t feel like paying Decipher prices for stuff.  They sell boxes at discount rate as well as singles.  From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Laskin Road (Rt. 58).  Stay on Laskin Road, go through the big First Colonial intersection.  Laskin Road will eventually merge into Virginia Beach Boulevard (you?ll see a ramp off to the left to get onto the interstate, do NOT take it) at another large intersection (Great Neck Road).  Go through the intersection, and a few more lights, until you get to another big intersection for Lynnhaven Parkway.  Go through that intersection, and turn right at the next light into a shopping center.  Turn left when you go in and you will see Comic Alternative near the left end of the strip shopping center.  (Free Parking)<br>
<br>
4.  JB?s Gallery of Girls (if you don?t know what this is, you?re too young to be going to a con) ? From the hotel, turn left onto Atlantic Avenue.  Turn right onto Virginia Beach Boulevard, eventually you?ll see it on the right.  I think it?s over-21, I?ve never been there.  (Parking ???)<br>
