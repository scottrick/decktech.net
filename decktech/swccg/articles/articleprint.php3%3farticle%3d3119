Let&#39;s begin:<br>
<br>
Companions:<br>
1)Aragorn, King in Exile<br>
2)Arwen, Daughter to Elrond<br>
3)Merry, from O&#39;er the Brandywine<br>
<br>
Aragorn is just a powerhouse. He is 8 strength and 4 vitality and has just as many (if not more) support cards that all the other characters. For starters, he is a MAN, so such cards as &quot;Dagger Strike&quot;, &quot;The Last Alliance of Elves and Men&quot;, &quot;Athelas&quot; etc. Beside those universal cards he also has an amazing array of personal cards, like &quot;Valiant man of the West&quot;, &quot;Aragorn&#39;s Bow&quot; &quot;Arwen&#39;s Fate&quot; etc. But really makes him stand out is his Ranger text, (&quot;A Ranger&#39;s Versatility&quot;, &quot;No Stranger to the Shadows&quot;,&quot;Swordsman of the N. Kingdom), and his built-in heal ability. Arwen is amazing versatile, she is an elf, a ranger, and has a Aragorn signet, plus a great ability against Nazgul. The 3rd most powerful companion is debatable, Legolas, Gandalf, Boromir, whatever. I chose Merry because of all the Hobbit cards that you can use to protect the Ring Bearear, you can also use to help Merry kill minions.<br>
<br>
Allies:<br>
1)Elrond<br>
2)Thrarin<br>
3)Bounder<br>
<br>
Elrond is easily the best ally as he is a healin-card-drawing machine. Dig Dig Dig! Thrarin is great utility as he can step up for skirmishes whenever you might need him. Bounders are game-winning, nuff&#39; said.<br>
<br>
Possesions:(Weapons)<br>
1)Gwemigil<br>
2)Blade of Gondor<br>
3)Aragorn&#39;s Bow<br>
<br>
Agree with Lolli that these are the best weapons, but Blade O&#39; Gondor is better than the bow since it can be used to kill Uruk-Hai/Orcs, and it gives a strength bonus + Damage +1, which makes it a little more versatile than the bow, and just that much better.<br>
<br>
Possesions:(Non-Weapons)<br>
1)The Mirror of Galadriel<br>
2)Old Toby<br>
3)Gandalf&#39;s Cart<br>
<br>
The Mirror is #1, no question. Old Toby is incredibly good, as it allows you to make use of Pipes, and nets you a card draw. Gandalf&#39;s Cart is bad-A$$ due to it&#39;s ability to fly through your hand by getting rid of useful cards that aren&#39;t useful at the time, but when they are they are there for you.<br>
<br>
Conditions:<br>
1)There and Back Again<br>
2)The Tale of Gil-Galad/Elendil<br>
3)NO Stranger to the Shadows<br>
<br>
TABA is simply awesome. It&#39;s like a +2 event for a whole fellowship. It&#39;s good. The tale are good to, everyone knows why. NO stranger to the shadows is one of my favorite cards. If you play 1-2 of these you can seriously hurt your opponent&#39;s shadow, as opposed to Shoulder to Shoulder which adds to it.<br>
<br>
Events:(Dwarfs)<br>
1)Delving<br>
2)Mithril Shaft<br>
3)Wealth of Moria<br>
<br>
They all do the same thing, dig for cards you need and manipulate your hand easily. I&#39;m not sure if any of them are better than the other, but this is the order I would include them in my deck.<br>
<br>
Events:(Elves)<br>
1)Double Shot<br>
2)Swan Ship of Galadriel/Support of the LHH<br>
3)Council of Elrond<br>
<br>
Double Shot is a Free-Peoples Hate, SSOG/SOTLHH get you cannon fodder that might actually win a skirmish. And Council of Elrond is great versatility.<br>
<br>
Events:(Gondor)<br>
1)A Ranger&#39;s Versatility<br>
2)Dagger Strike<br>
3)Valiant Man of the West<br>
<br>
ARV is one of the best cards in the game, direct damage at it&#39;s best and combines with so many other cards for insto-minion-death. Dagger Strike is the best pump-card in the game, hands down, and VMOTW is a great way to keep someone alive.<br>
<br>
Events:(Gandalf)<br>
1)Servant of the Secret Fire<br>
2)Sleep, Caradhras<br>
3)Risk a Little Light<br>
<br>
SOTSS is basically +3 to ANYONE, how can you beat that? Sleep is life-saving, and RALL is a cheap card that get you what you need.<br>
<br>
Events:(Shire)<br>
1)Power According to his Stature<br>
2)Hobbit Stealth/Intuition<br>
3)Stout and Sturdy<br>
<br>
PATHS is broken, HS/HI are decks in themselves, and SAS is just a funny card that can work. (After PATHS and HI/HS what other Shire events do you use?)<br>
<br>
Well that&#39;s it, this article is mainly a rebuttal to Lolli&#39;s article, make your opionion, copy someone else&#39;s, <br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
