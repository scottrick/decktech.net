I am doing the same for Enhanced Jabba's Palace.  These articles are written with newbies and intermediates in mind, but I believe that advanced players can always benefit from thorough analysis of new cards.  This first article will be on the Dark Objective, aptly called 'Court of the Vile Gangster/ I Will Enjoy Watching You Die.'  This is the exact game text, as confirmed by Decipher.<br>
<br>
--Court of the Vile Gangster--	(I will refer to this as COTVG later)<br>
Deploy Audience Chamber, Dungeon, and Great Pit of Carkoon.<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one docking bay or [independent] starship from reserve deck; reshuffle.	Bounty Hunters are forfeit +2 and are immune to Goo Nee Tay.  You may not play Scanning Crew.  Each player loses 1 Force at end of each of their deploy phases unless that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine battleground site.<br>
Flip this card if you have 2 captives (or a captive of ability &gt;2) at any Jabba's Palace sites.<br>
<br>
--I Will Enjoy Watching You Die-- (referred to as IWEWYD)<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases may deploy Sarlacc, Rancor, or Rancor Pit from reserve deck; reshuffle.  Captives targeted by Trap Door are immediately relocated (do not draw destiny) and Trap Door may not be canceled.  Opponent loses Force equal to forfeit value of each opponent's character eaten by Rancor or Sarlacc.  (place character out of play)<br>
Flip if no captives are at Tatooine sites and opponent has no characters at same site as Rancor.<br>
<br>
Let us methodically examine this objective.  First notice what you deploy before the game begins: the Audience Chamber, the Dungeon, and the Great Pit of Carkoon.  This automatically allows you to activate 5 Force without the opponent's help.  That alone is great, the most Force any objective has done so far.   Deploying the Audience Chamber early is obviously an advantage, since that means you can deploy an alien there from reserve quickly.	I anticipate we will see decks that deploy characters such as Boba Fett, Mara Jade, and Jabba from the reserve deck very quickly in order to make a fast start.  However, a weakness to this objective is a deck using Obi-Wan's Hut + Careful Planning to deploy the Light Audience Chamber.	I would say that an 'Audience Chamber/Toshe Station Tech' deck would be COTVG's nemesis.  (Also note that as I'm writing this we have not yet seen the Light objective, which could change things.	Please remember that as you review)  Then again, that type of start might be beneficial to your next strategy--capturing.  Since you are virtually guaranteed to see characters on Tatooine, you will have an easier time flipping your objective.<br>
<br>
Next I want to point out that COTVG is an Operatives (and I would also add Quiet Mining Colony) decimator!  You could almost say it has a built in Visage of the Emperor, with its 'Each player loses 1 Force at end. . .' text.  In addition, you can't cancel that damage without coming to Tatooine, your hometown (so to speak)!  Furthermore, you can deploy an independent starship from your reserve deck.  Can you say 'Hidden Base Tech?'  I thought so.	Deploy Boba Fett in Slave I on the third turn and beatdown that lone X-Wing, take Jabba's Space Cruiser for a spin with an Outer Rim Scout to guide, or get out Dengar in Punishing One to make a Falcon useless.  This also is effective against Quiet Mining Colony decks that use Clouds (Cloud Car killers!) and Operatives.  You can make it almost impossible for Operatives to mount a defense against Battle Order!  You can also deploy a docking bay from reserve deck, which means that your bounty hunters can transport their captives all across the galaxy!  I recommend putting a Spaceport Docking Bay in your deck always, since it isn't Ops decks don't use it as frequently.  You can also deploy your starships there for a bit cheaper than at a system, if you don't plan to battle that turn.  Not only this, but your Bounty Hunters are also forfeit +2 and are immune to Goo Nee Tay.  This is great, for it prevents your hunters from being killed all at once or from not being deployed.  Combine all these traits together, and I believe this objective can effectively dismantle Quiet Mining Colony, Operatives, and possibly even Hidden Base!  You might never even want to flip Court of the Vile Gangster!	Last but not least-- the downside.  You cannot play Scanning Crew.  Decipher did this so we would not see a new Manipulator deck come into the tournament scene.  It makes sense, but just remember that your focus for a COTVG deck cannot be manipulation through Scanning Crew.<br>
<br>
So if you flip this objective, how will it help you?  Well, though you lose the benefit of deploying ships from reserve deck, eliminating the threat of Goo Nee Tay, and making your Bounty Hunters survive longer, your benefits from flipping to I Will Enjoy Watching You Die look very interesting.  IWEWYD basically gives you something to do with your captives-- let them get eaten!  As Salacious Crumb would say: 'AH-hahahahaha!'	I know that laugh. . . ;-)  Back to strategy.  You are allowed to deploy Sarlacc, Rancor Pit, and the Rancor from your reserve deck.  This frees you from having to put multitudes of these cards into your deck, although you need to be concerned about losing them if you don't.  More than 2 of any of these is probably extravagant (and perhaps overthemed).  But not only can you deploy your big bad creatures from reserve deck, your opponent also loses force equal to the captive's forfeit when the captive is eaten, and the character is placed out of play (though the Sarlacc acomplished this anyway)!  In addition, drawing destiny for Trap Door is no longer required!  Then what happens when the captives are gone?  You flip back and go at it again!  Note the conditions for un-flipping though.  It says that it un-flips if opponent has no captives at Tatooine sites and opponent has no characters at same site as Rancor.  I do not think this means that once you get your captives to the Audience Chamber it immediately unflips.	That would present a constant-flip situation which Decipher has always avoided.  I think this means that once you rid yourself of the captives you unflip, unless you have somebody such as Obi-Wan trapped in the Rancor Pit and not dying (poor Ben, that's just abut torture!); in that case you still would not unflip.  It depends on whether or not the Audience Chamber is considered to be a Tatooine site.  I could be wrong, but somehow I doubt it.<br>
<br>
So what Court of the Vile Gangster deck type should you use?  What cards need to be essential to your strategy?  I will attempt to answer those questions in this next section.<br>
<br>
Think about what you will use as your starting interrupt.  You could use Any Methods Necessary and take into your hand IG-88 with Riot Gun and IG-88 in IG-2000 or Boba Fett and Fett in Slave I (and, of course, another prison).  Getting Iggy into your hand quickly is a great asset.  Plus, his capturing ability with the Riot Gun allows you to flip quickly (that is the one disadvantage to taking Boba Fett with AMN).  An obvious choice would be to start with Twi'lek Advisor plus All Wrapped Up for quick capturing.  You could also start with Scum and Villainy, but that could be quickly canceled if the opponent deploys his Audience Chamber.  That could be an optional start, so to speak.  Another option is to start with Surface Defense to pull out all three effects.  This would allow you immediate protection against Numbers, Sense and Alter, and heavy retrieval decks.  It is a good choice in my opinion.	Other Effects to start with depend on your deck focus and your local meta.<br>
<br>
Obviously, you need your bounty hunters and independent starships.  Your choice of hunters and ships, though, must be careful.	You must decide whether you want XYZ bounty hunter on the ground or in space.  My opinion concerning the big name Bounty Hunters (Boba Fett, Bossk, Zuckuss, Dengar, IG-88, 4-Lom) is that I would use Bossk, Zuckuss, and Dengar in space, and Boba Fett, IG-88, and 4-Lom (that one's kind of a no-brainer considering he isn't a pilot) on the ground.  You also have hunters such as Bane Malar, Ree-Yees, Djas Puhr, Jodo Kast, and even Beedo, Danz Borin, Felitipern Trevagg,	and Greedo for back-up.  (just watch out for Master Luke!)  I would venture to guess, though, that we'll see more hunters in later sets.  Besides, you can always use Outer Rim Scouts with independent starships if need be.	Another necessity if you are capturing is docking bays, which you ought to have.  I would recommend that you use the Tatooine docking bay, Cloud City docking bay, and at least one Spaceport Docking Bay.  Adding in the Hoth and Yavin docking bays are pretty much meta choices.<br>
<br>
Your choice of locations will be critical too.	In my opinion, you shouldn't use many Tatooine sites (although a Cantina is essential), because you'll want to get your captives to Jabba's Palace sites as quickly as possible.  However, using vehicles (such as Jabba's Sail Barge and Skiffs) will solve that problem.<br>
<br>
Another choice you must make is whether to use the Rancor, Sarlacc, or both.  I wouldn't use both in most cases, although throwing in one Sarlacc just for spite and surprise might be interesting.  You might be on the run, get to the Pit of Carkoon, and then deploy the Sarlacc when he gets there and let the opponent be annihlated.  In my opinion, though, the Rancor seems a little more secure.  It has less of a chance of dying from an assault (could the Light side even make one?), and eats characters more easily.  But that is your choice. . .<br>
<br>
Are there any other cards that you absolutely must have in your deck?  Certainly so.  If using All Wrapped Up, adding We Have A Prisoner (if using imperials) and especially Ooota Goota Solo and could be beneficial.	I would almost always add Ooota Goota Solo because that card could change the whole game.  If you could capture Old Ben and Luke at the same time, then place them out of play, you would be in spectacular shape.   You might also consider adding Binders (so you can have multiple captives on a hunter), Human Shield (protection is good), all different Bounties, Hidden Weapons, Mandalorian Armor, Res Luk Ra'auf, Wounded Wookie, Jabba's Through With You, Jabba's Sail Barge, Mara Jade, Boelo, Jabba (definitely use him!), and the usual tech cards.  If you aren't using Scum and Villainy, Vader, Tarkin, and some Star Destroyers will definitely be helpful.   Be sure to tune your deck to your local meta, that could be the key to victory in local tournaments.<br>
<br>
Another question to ask is whether you will even flip objective or not.  You may be content to keep it on the first side and let them take damage as you deploy your super-hunters and ships, or you may want to go with all-out capturing.  Go with what works in your tournament area!<br>
<br>
There aren't a whole lot of different decks possible with Court of the Vile Gangster, but I will outline what I believe to be the two best possibilities.  Unfortunately, there aren't many ways to bend and break this objective.<br>
<br>
Dedicated Capturing-- This deck would be committed to taking out the opponent by capturing and making him lose his Force to your Rancor or Sarlacc.  It is the most basic of the proposed deck types, but requires a lot of work.  It seems, though, that this is also the best type of deck with this objective.<br>
<br>
Non-Flip Tech-- This would be great in areas where non-interactive decks, Hidden Base Numbers, and Operatives are the craze.  You could really take out the opposition from these decks if you play with the right cards and use the text to your advantage.  It might work well with a side strategy of capturing, too.  It also could give you a psychological advantage ('uh-oh, he's playing with that new card!').  It is very susceptible to areas where Tatooine is the battleground of choice.  The other bonus to using this objective in this style would be the quick activation.<br>
<br>
 So there you have it!	A thorough overview of Court of the Vile Gangster!  I hope that you enjoyed and learned from it, no matter what your experience level is.  Add your comments as you review; tell me and others your ideas.  We welcome them earnestly!	You May Either Profit By This/Or Be Destroyed is next!<br>
