I played Light Side for the day. I wanted to share some strategies that worked for me and for others in order to help everyone out in this cool environment. This will include both what you SHOULD do and what NOT to do. They are only suggestions; you are of course always able to do whatever you want with your own deck. Here was my LS:<br>

<br>
<br>
ABOUT MY DECK<br>
First, you might notice the lack of locations. I start generating 6 Force on my own, my opponent is going to give me 2 more at the start and more later on, and my cards deploy for 2 and 3 Force (less with Tessek). Kiffex is an easy Force generator where I don&#146;t have to defend a Force drain. That&#146;s nice. I also don&#146;t have to worry about Underworld contacts for a drain, as it adds to generation, not an actual icon.<br>
<br>
As for cards I didn&#146;t pull, here are the ones I would have replaced:<br>
* The Audience Chamber (instead of the Antechamber at the start)<br>
* Sandwhirl<br>
* Bargaining Table<br>
<br>
A simple note to start your deckbuilding before I really explain the deck: USE THE OBJECTIVE! The ability to get your generation FAST, get the 0 destinies out of your deck, and cancel a battle destiny is PRICELESS in this environment where every card must do its part.<br>
<br>
THE TECH<br>
Okay, here goes the fun part. I added every Wind Chimes that I pulled right off. I decided that I didn&#146;t need any more destiny 0 cards in the deck than I already had. I reluctantly added Kiffex to the deck when I finally realized that I could use just a couple more Force a turn and didn&#146;t have to defend it.<br>
<br>
With the number of Baragwins I pulled, I added them all and also included every weapon that I pulled. This way, I don&#146;t lose Force too easily as long as I remember to lose the weapon on top of the Lost Pile. I can lose a Force to a drain, use a Force to retrieve it. I can repeat this three times per turn if I&#146;ve got them all out.<br>
<br>
The only reason Ounee Ta is in the deck is to recirculate Lando. I&#146;ll drop him in a kamikaze mission, do some damage, and let him die on my opponent&#146;s turn. That lets me play Ounee Ta on my turn and retrieve him (being the top card) next turn!<br>
<br>
I can lose a weapon to a drain, pay 1 to retrieve it with my Baragwin, play Weapon Levitation to get a weapon from my Used Pile, lose it again, and retrieve it again with my other Baragwin.<br>
<br>
I dropped most of the ability cards I pulled into the deck. I didn&#146;t add a couple cards, but they were all deploy 2, power 1, ability 2 cards anyway, so I didn&#146;t worry so much. If I had pulled a Bargaining Table, I would have added every single one of them.<br>
<br>
I also had some character tech in the works. Such cool ideas included:<br>
* Palace Raider and Lando on a skiff. It gives me a free react to any battle and puts power 8, exlude a character, and 3 battle destinies in the battle<br>
* B&#146;omarr Monks alone at my 2-1 sites draining with a skiff within range<br>
* Baragwins retrieve weapons<br>
* Snivvens deploy as reacts<br>
* Gran at the Audience Chamber with Bo Shuda. Turns him into an Undercover Spy and retrieves a Force when most battles are initiated<br>
* Tessek at the Chamber reduces all of my aliens by 1 for deploy and adds 1 to drains that can&#146;t be cancelled (Underworld Contacts)<br>
* ALWAYS save 3 Force for Rennek<br>
* Lando excludes a character, and Ghoel keeps the other from drawing a destiny.<br>
<br>
Remember that Tessek is only a beast IF you have the Audience Chamber. I learned this the hard way!<br>
<br>
Finally, we&#146;re down to You Will Take Me To Jabba Now and Corellian Retort. Most DS decks will have Mighty Jabba, so you can jump around Jabba&#146;s Palace. If not, I needed to hope DS played the Audience Chamber (most DS decks did this) to use the text. Corellian Retort was a Used Interrupt, Destiny 5, always usable and easily trackable card (see my Tracking Simplified article for more). I can use The Signal, Take Me To Jabba, Corellian Retort, Weapon Lev, and Wind Chimes to track my incredibly high destinies. The only really bad destinies I have in the deck are Kiffex (0), Lando (1), and Tessek (1). I have a couple 2s, and everything else is a 3 or higher. That&#146;s really nice in any sealed environment.<br>
<br>
I hope this will help you play in a JPSD game. Always remember that if you lose, it&#146;s because you didn&#146;t get the right cards! Good luck in your tournaments.
