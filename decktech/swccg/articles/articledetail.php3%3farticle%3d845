tournaments, to the exception of the occasional HDADTJ,<br>
HB, Training, Profit, Court, Harvest, and ISB winners.<br>
I'm not going to claim I don't play these decks, but I<br>
won't be sorry to see them go. I'm therefore going to<br>
briefly explain their power and then show certain tactics<br>
that I hope will allow you to beat them and hence shorten<br>
their dominance.<br>
<br>
This first part, explaining the power of the decks, will<br>
seem quite unnecessary and obvious, but a full analysis<br>
of the decks is requiered before counter-strategies can<br>
be determined.<br>
<br>
Throne Room decks are reactionary decks that rely on<br>
superior activation to force the opponent into a<br>
compromising position which can then be exploited. The<br>
start of TR/Swamp/Farm gives them five force minimum<br>
and first action. They will then use Nudjs to eat up your<br>
force icons on their sites by the second turn at latest,<br>
plenty of twix (2/0) locations to create a grater<br>
activation gap, and in some cases Revolutions to deny you<br>
of the force your locations give you. They will then seek<br>
to put you on a clock by establishing a suitable drain or<br>
using some form of direct damage (AFA, Civil Disorder).<br>
This will force you into either setting up your force<br>
loss for your opponent, or going to fight him, usually<br>
before you are as prepared as you would hope to be. At<br>
this point, the LS abuses its activation advantage and<br>
begins fighting you with superior forces. Hence it will<br>
either kill you with battle damage, or send you back to<br>
the aforementioned situation of making you lose force.<br>
<br>
ROPs decks will generally either start with IAO, to get<br>
out docking bays, prevent Nabrum beat down, and increase<br>
their forfeit, or BFHI to make deploying mains to Ralltiir<br>
incredibly expensive. These cards, and the objective's +2<br>
to deploy, get out non-unique imperials/sites, will<br>
generally allow them to flip their objective without much<br>
trouble. They will usually setup on Ralltiir with either<br>
ATSTs or speeder bikes, both of which allow them to react<br>
to any invasion attempts you might launch, but ATSTs are<br>
generally more common because they protect the pilots<br>
from enhanced weapons fire. The 2 force to search reserve<br>
deck part of the flipped objective will allow them to<br>
setup combos and destiny draws. The -1 force drain<br>
modifier, combined with Imp. Decree or ABCTTU will quickly<br>
lockdown the opponents force drains, while they consistently<br>
drain for three or four at Ralltiir. This will force the<br>
opponent to battle, at which point the combos/destinies<br>
that have been setup, in addition to the objective's<br>
battle destiny bonus, will quickly clear site after site<br>
of rebels, with minimal casualties for the Empire. Hired<br>
scum (BH ships) dominate the systems, and the Rebellion<br>
withers.<br>
<br>
So now, how can they be stopped? Deck design is important<br>
to beating them, but so is how you play. I'll both deck<br>
design and playing style for both match-ups.<br>
<br>
Throne Room decks have two parts to beat, first is the<br>
force choke, and then the mains. CTR is very important,<br>
and if you don't pack it + 2-3 Evaders, your locations<br>
better all be immune to Rev, or be 2/2s. Death Star is<br>
an awesome opening against TR, because its immune to<br>
Rev, gives you three force and none to him, and gives<br>
them first turn, which they already had; just be prepared<br>
for the inevitable Tentative. Location selection will<br>
take you a long way towards avoiding the force choke.<br>
Make sure your deck can function on the force it produces,<br>
don't count on the opponent playing Kessel, Cantina, ect.<br>
Low deploy costs will offset location selection, so go with<br>
one or the other. If you're sick of Nudjs, go with Bubo<br>
to quickly chomp them in one turn (he attacks them<br>
immediately, not during the battle phase) and give you<br>
access to two drain two locations, Farm &amp; TR. Or go with<br>
Mara, kill some Nudjs and then drain with her sabre for 3.<br>
Be prepared for the force choke, and in the worse case<br>
you'll have too much force (oh darn). As for the mains,<br>
we've all dealt with them before. Jodo/Tarkin/Wounded<br>
Wookie to cancel destinies, DLOTS/Trample/Evazan for<br>
early deaths, 4LOM to be a nuisance by taking away<br>
destinies/weapons/immunity/Ben revival, and Dannik/<br>
capturing to keep them from coming back. Use walkers to<br>
keep you safe from weapons. Finally the ultimate counter<br>
for TR is Imperial Occupation on Yavin 4. Get the swamp<br>
out quick to get Bubo, setup Rebel Base Occupation, and<br>
hit them with drains at their nice sites, while Rebel<br>
Base Occupation causes massive force loss. Just be ready<br>
to catch Endor Celebration. Now as for how to play against<br>
TR, remember that it is a reactionary deck, and hence<br>
will usually play on your turf; make sure you have the<br>
advantage. Try to split up his forces, mains are weaker<br>
without teamwork, so apply pressure both in space and on<br>
ground if possible. If playing HDADTJ, use the threat of<br>
dueling to delay Obi and Luke, choke Chewi, and remember<br>
to have Vader's bastard daughter hinder them. Don't<br>
deploy until you're ready, and don't let early force loss<br>
scare you, it's worse to battle unprepared. If your deck<br>
has force retrieval, take even longer, they'll get scared<br>
and commit more of their forces, then keep them from<br>
jumping around using Nabrun with IAO or Oota Goota Solo?<br>
Spies will buy you lots of time, and let you get to those<br>
nice twix sites to drain. Be mindful of an uncoming<br>
beatdown, and use Monnok to keep him from getting too<br>
much power into his hand; activation won't help him if<br>
he's got nothing to do and you're saving up force. And<br>
most importantly, always play your deck like you should,<br>
don't let him force you into a defensive position if your<br>
strength is offense, or vice versa. Most TR decks win by<br>
draining at you locations or from battles, don't help<br>
any more than you have to.<br>
<br>
Against ROPs, there are also two things to beat, the<br>
objective, and the battles/drains. Many people make the<br>
mistake of thinking that if they can flip the objective<br>
or keep it from flipping, they've won, but aside from the<br>
additional battle destiny that they're preventing, they<br>
must still face the deck's offensive capabilities, and<br>
usually hold two sites at the same time, by no means an<br>
easy feat against an experienced ROPs player. Additional<br>
strategies must be employed. But first, lets discuss how<br>
to flip the objective back. I have found that keeping the<br>
objective from flipping is quite hard, since you draining<br>
for one at his sites is hardly enough to force him to<br>
attack you until he has a sizable force assembled, you<br>
are then forced to resupply your forces at a +2 deploy<br>
cost and eventually are forced out of Ralltiir, after<br>
a lot of battle damage. Remember that most ROPs decks,<br>
use four sites so that you need to occupy two sites to<br>
keep them from flipping. I recommend draining for as much<br>
as possible with non-essential cards until he flips, at<br>
which point you try to cause carnage and flip him back.<br>
For your offense, the standard Frozen Assets/Draw Their<br>
Fire is great, keeps him from reacting (watch out for<br>
Tempest 1)and Ghhhking. Watch out for Main Course, catch<br>
it if possible, and redeploy FA, remember, they have to<br>
cancel it during the deploy phase, if they try during the<br>
battle phase, you have first action and as soon as you<br>
initiate battle, they have to pay one to use it. Any<br>
Methods and Imp. Supply are also pains, and if at all<br>
possible pack Beggars, also prevents him from saving<br>
force. Mech Failure is a great card, but save it for the<br>
best opportunity. If you're seeing ROPs a lot in your<br>
meta, try playing a swamp in your deck. They will usually<br>
play either their best react or weakest link to the swamp,<br>
because the +3 to battle protects them, by converting,<br>
you battle for one and keep him from reacting to or from<br>
the site. A nice way to keep the two sites after you flip<br>
them back is using Gimmer Stick on a site while your main<br>
defense holds the first site. Use Order To Engage to create<br>
a nice force loss, they can only react if you battle, so<br>
they'll be running and loosing force, or bunching up and<br>
letting you prevent the flip. Remember that out-lasting<br>
them is critical, so bacta tank is great. Drain them off<br>
planet when their objective is flipped back, the loss<br>
will quickly accumulate. If you like spies, abuse them<br>
at will. Boush will keep him from making your drains on<br>
Ralltiir zero, and Sabotage will allow you to quickly<br>
decimate his AT-ST during your control phase so that you<br>
can then put the hurt on them with battle. Remember R2<br>
can't be trampled. Another severly underused card is<br>
chewy's flashlight, if you're packing SAC and can save<br>
him from tramples, chewy can quickly turn those AT-STs<br>
and even AT-ATs into heaps o' rubble, with all those<br>
pilots trapped inside. There's also the option of speeders<br>
with power harpoons, but I think that most people already<br>
play with chewy, and not speeders. If ground is not your<br>
thing then I suggest a more discrete option: clouds. Why<br>
clouds and not the system you ask? First you can have two<br>
clouds, thereby holding the objective on the zero side,<br>
second you can provide a nice drain +1 to any sites you<br>
might get a hold off, and last but certainly not least,<br>
only starfighters can go into clouds, so aside from BiHT<br>
and JSC you can abuse one card to no end, X-wing Laser<br>
Cannon. Blast away at those BH ships to your hearts<br>
content, only BFiS1 should give you any trouble. If<br>
X-wings are not your style, the packs Lando in Falcon,<br>
Z-95 Defense Fighters or Cloud Cars and Local Defense.<br>
Destiny four used interrupt that lets you get out your<br>
ships, and add a battle destiny in the clouds. If BH<br>
ships are still to much, look at a nice little effect<br>
called Eject! Eject!. Then watch all his ships fly around<br>
empty. To get around the +2 deploy, try using docking bays<br>
or Nabrun. Regardless of you you cause the flip back,<br>
remember that battling them on Ralltiir will be tough,<br>
so get as much draining and direct damage in as you<br>
possibly can. Much like TR, the trick to playing against<br>
ROPs is not to loose your cool. If the drain -1 shuts<br>
your deck down, then limit your presence on Ralltiir to<br>
fliping the objective back, unless you think you can<br>
liberate the entire planet. Keep your presence protected,<br>
and be mindfull of the reacts, total battle destiny, and<br>
that if you only have one site they can deploy another<br>
and block your control for one turn, thereby flipping the<br>
objective. As silly as it might sound, draining is the<br>
best way to beat this match-up, it requires a lot of cards<br>
on the table, so even a little draining goes a long way.<br>
<br>
Well I hope this helped, and that you got through it all.<br>
I might be a bit jumpy at some parts, but realize that I<br>
didn't write it all at one sitting. I hope I didn't miss<br>
anything, if I did please either mention it in the reviews<br>
so that others can read it, or let me know in a message.<br>
With some luck, this will allow some of you to beat TR and<br>
ROPs with more frequency. If you have any questions, let<br>
me know.<br>
