Will Schmidt (retired Gold 18) convinced me to come to a tournament.  This was not any tourny; it was a scenario tournament.  This was just after Cloud City came out and Decipher was trying to promote it using this new tournament style.  The basic idea was that a player was trying to complete certain tasks to recreate the Cloud City scenes in the Empire Strikes Back.  By completing a certain number of them, one would receive a scenario victory.  This scenario victory received 2 victory points (a full win).  If you won without doing this or did a timed win, you would only receive a 1 point win (a modified win).<br>
<br>
Since that time, I have become a tournament director.  I find myself modeling my style after Will.  I make sure everyone goes home with some kind of prize support.  I try to do the best I can to discourage unsportsman-like play (including too much profanity).  I give pointers to the new guys after the game.  But the thing I missed when I started playing was the scenario event.<br>
<br>
Now, Decipher does not sanction these any more.  Therefore, to hold one seems like holding an unsanctioned tournament.  But I have found a way around this.  Please read on and review this article if you would like to host or play in such an event; if not, find another article to read because this would waste your time.<br>
<br>
First, the premise behind my scenario tournaments is that I want the players to recreate part of a Star Wars film.  In this article, I will use as an example my third scenario tournament titled &amp;#8220;Black Knight, White Princess, and Pawns&amp;#8221;.  The scenario related to those opening scenes of Star Wars until Vader captured Leia.  The players who could do so were most successful at this tournament.<br>
<br>
To prepare for the event, I had to put together a scoresheet.  The scoresheet is based of eight points.  The player must earn eight points in one game in order to get a scenario victory.  I plan for six games (three rounds).  I choose a number of events for the players to accomplish to earn those points.  One set for the Dark Side and one set for the Light Side.<br>
<br>
Let me take a moment to expand on this.  I assign points based on difficulty to do and strategic complications of doing so.  First, I consider what characters I need to involve and which persona to use.  (I gave 3 points each time Leia with ability &lt;3 was deployed.)  This, in essence, gave scenario points for deploying Jedi Pack Leia.  Next, I think about what major events took place during this point of the film.  (I gave 1 point each draw phase where &gt;1 unique droid was at the Tatooine system.  I gave 1 point for each Stormtrooper hit by Leia&amp;#8217;s Sporting Blaster.  I gave Dark Side 1 point for each Stormtrooper that initiates a battle with Leia.  Dark Side earned 3 points if Leia was captured by a trooper. 2 points also went to the Dark Side if &gt;2 troopers participated in a Besieged battle.)  I look through the important places and things in the film.  (1 point when the Tantive IV Force drained at Tatooine.  1 point goes to the Dark Side whenever a Tractor Beam captures a starship with another 1 point if it was the Tantive IV!)  Finally, I look through the effects and interrupts that were related to this part of the film.  (1 point was awarded whenever any of the following were played/deployed: Warrior&amp;#8217;s Courage, Rebel Reinforcements, Dark Jedi Presence, Escape Pod, etc.)  I try not to use Special Edition cards for this last purpose.  (I like making players fish through that collection of New Hope commons!)  Needless to say, this is the MOST IMPORTANT PART of planning a scenario event.  If you seriously want to hold one, get this part down first!<br>
As you can probably see, various suggested strategies emerge after a good scoresheet is published to the players.  Usually, I only reward a victory point if the action is completed successfully.  For instance, the Dark Side goes for their point by Force draining at Tatooine with the Devastator but Light Side plays Surprise Assault, the Dark Side is denied their scenario point because the action was cancelled before it had an effect.<br>
<br>
Well, the day of the tourny has come.  You have put it on Decipher&amp;#8217;s web site.  All your friends and their friends had their scoresheet weeks in advance so they could build decks.  Your prize support is accumulated.  You&amp;#8217;re ready to welcome your players and review scenario rules.  You collect your Entry Fee (I find $4 a player should get most players something to take home if you purchase in advance on sale.)  The first game begins and eventually it comes time to record results.  This is where sanctioning comes in.<br>
<br>
When a scenario event is planned, I state that scenario decks will be rewarded but not required.  This means you can have a Bring Him Before Me deck participate; it just won&amp;#8217;t be able to earn scenario points.  Decipher won&amp;#8217;t sanction a tourny that limits decks so don&amp;#8217;t do that.  Next, Decipher won&amp;#8217;t sanction a tourny where results are modified to please a director; a full win is a full win.  I solve this problem by having a scenario score AND a Decipher score.  A win is recorded on the command card like so:<br>
2 victory points: Scenario wins with eight points for that game<br>
1 victory point: a time win OR full win without eight scenario points regardless of deck<br>
0 victory points: any loss<br>
<br>
When the results are sent to Decipher, though, they are sent in as:<br>
2 victory points: any non-timed win<br>
1 victory point: any timed win<br>
0 victory points: any loss<br>
<br>
So you see, the scenario points only affect the day of the tourny.  It has no bearing on the results sent to Decipher.  If this seems difficult, it&amp;#8217;s not.  Try it and see.  Also, Endor/DSII closed events lend themselves easily to the scenario format and makes for a good scenario event to try first.<br>
<br>
But why then keep track of scenario points?  This is why:<br>
The day is over.  You put the command cards in order ranking based on their SCENARIO SCORE.  You will probably have many odd numbered victory point totals.  It&amp;#8217;s time to give out prizes.  Weigh the prizes toward those with the most victory points as usual.  Now, those who played scenario and completed scenario games with eight scenario points usually will rise to the top.  (The guy with that undefeated Carbon Freezing deck did well, but only scored six victory points while his brother who played scenario and won only four games has eight victory points.)  A common prize distribution works like this for me:<br>
1st Place: three packs, a foil, and a Leia Pez dispenser<br>
2nd Place: three packs and R2-D2 poster<br>
3rd Place: three packs<br>
4th &amp;#8211;6th Place: one pack of limited and one of revised<br>
7th Place: one pack of reflections and one revised (he needs some help with his collection)<br>
8th Place: one pack of reflections and two of revised (he too needs a boost)<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some hints to holding such an event: 1) Provide &amp;#8220;extra incentive&amp;#8221; to playing a scenario deck even to non-winning decks or games &amp;#8211; I use chocolate.  2) Post the scenario scoresheet well in advance to your local players and provide them with a means of communication with you (I use my local listserve and Email).  3) Play scenario yourself.  4) Add in a trivia contest related to your scenario event (I even add packs as prizes).  5) Try to give out a few scenario-related prizes.  6) How about some Star Wars music in the background or a photo montage on a screen saver?  7) Be prepared for tough questions and prepare a specific scoresheet.  8) Have a plan for players who draw up to prevent an opponent from receiving their scenario points (I usually say that if a loss comes from drawing up Life Force, your opponent automatically completes one scenario event of their choosing).<br>
<br>
So, what are the advantages of this kind of tournament?  The most important is that players play for fun.  A bloodthirsty competition weekly does not attract new players or create a fun environment for all players.  Secondly, this type of game fosters creativity in deck building &amp;#8211; you can&amp;#8217;t go to Deck Tech the night before the game on this one.  Scenario games can lead to trying out forgotten cards or unused strategies.  Also, scenario games can add variety to the weekly tournament scene and re-energize players.  Finally, it puts most players on a more equal playing field.  The guy who always goes home undefeated weekly can no longer use the same strategies to be successful at the scenario game.  <br>
<br>
This kind of game doesn&amp;#8217;t always take off the first time.  But, stay excited about the concept.  Hold a second and third many weeks later.  (Don&amp;#8217;t try this as a weekly event.)  <br>
<br>
In conclusion, with planning, you can participate in a scenario event.  It can be sanctioned and the players can have a great time in a different style of play.  In my local area, I have held about six such events.  Not only has each one been sanctioned, but also those who play in one often return to another.  And interest is increasing!<br>
To many that read this for the first time, a scenario event might seem overwhelming.  Surprisingly, it&amp;#8217;s fairly easy.  But, it does take a little extra effort in planning and advertising.<br>

As always, I encourage suggestions.<br>
