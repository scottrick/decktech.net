<br>
<br>
In the last article about efficiency, i discussed several basic underlying principals of deck construction, that while often overlooked, are the fundamental basis for good swccg decks, and form the foundation from which the more complex and abstract concpets are based. Established is that you must consider the metagame when building your deck to support only the inclusion of cards that are supported by either the cards you or your (potential) opponent is playing. Established is that SWCCG decks have two main goals, disruption and damage, and that your cards must focus either around disruption and damage, to the exclusion of all other possibilities, unless somehow related to disruption or damage, and Established is that in choosing your deck, you must at some level consider the efficient use of cards by the number of cards in the strategy, the cards' effect on your ability to deal damage and effecively disrupt your opponent, and the number of card slots it takes to accomplish those goals. The principals of Inidividual card efficiency and Overlapping Substrategies will attempt to build on those established principals, and i suggest that you reffer to V.1 for a reference when needed.<br>
<br>
The Fourth Principal: Overlapping Substrategies<br>
<br>
Overlapping Substrategies can be defined in several ways, but after consideration, the best definition would have to be this one: the extent to which cards used in your main strategy and side strategies (essentially the cards used in damage and disruption) participate in the other strategies present in your deck design. The simplest example of this is in the case of characters and starships. Note that characters and starships can be included as either disruption or damage (they are required to 'force drain') and it is only in certain cases (like the inclusion of starships in a design with no system locations) that a set or subset of characters is every completely arrayed as either a damage or disruption card type. So, characters and starships are efficient. We like to include them in our designs because they serve both the purpose of damagin your opponent directly with force drains, and disrupting them with battles. So the inclusion of characters is an efficient use of cards (WHICH characters to include is a function of your deck design however, and will be discussed momentarily) because they serve multiple purposes with one card-slot, and thus conserve deckspace (a principal i will discuss later in draw percentages). Overlapping substrategies can almost be simplified into your  and substrategies are efficient only to the extent that they are multiply useful and the cards present in them are included in other strategies. A few quick examples: In a deck with characters, it follows that you would attempt to include substrategies involving those characters in either greater damage or disruption capacity. Skrillings that use numbers is an example of efficiency in that by playing the characters present in your main strategy (damage by spread force drain with multiples of a non-unique) you are allowed to play several damage/disruption strategies based upon your main strategy that include inserts (with the destiny 4 they are quite effective, and serve as an effective disruption technique as well as efficient damage) and retreival (a form of disruption, discussed earlier) with Abyssin ornament and Scum and Villany as well as the bargaining table. All of which give multiple uses to playing your skrillings. A side effect (a powerful side effect) of this is that your cards never seem useless, because there are multiple tasks they can perform all of which further your goal of victory. Almost everyone has played against someone who seems to draw exactly the right card every time with their deck. This is more than likely an example of this principal in action in their deck design. Another example of this principal woulud be on the edge in a mains deck. It causes your characters to be more effective in two ways in that its retreival (thus recycling characters that are lost into your deck to be replayed, increasing your disruption ability) or used as a ghhhk (pick a 7 with no 7s in your deck) and in general is an efficient use of cards and doesnt require any substrata of cards to be used (given that you can count cards or track destinies fairly well). This breaks down to that the STRATEGIES in them should 'overlap' to the extent that the cards used to accomplish those strategies are used to accomplish other strategies present in your deck.<br>
	The Reasons for including overlap in your substrategies are varied and convincing. The first would be the principal of multiple levels of strategy  (read 'dawi' akers post on 'redundancy' for more info about that) or that the more ways to complete an objective you have in your deck, the greater the likelihood that it will be completed regardless of the disruption techniques employed by your opponent. Overlapping strategies reduces the amount of deckspace required to accomplish those strategies, thus allowing you to either include MORE cards related to those strategies to increase the frequency and speed with which they are accomplished (draw percentages is coming tommorow or the next day and will deal with this particular topic in more detail). This is to say that by overlapping stratgies you have the option of inculding MORE strateiges into your deck, or further reinforcing the strategies you DO choose to include. An example (a very complex one, to which i may devote an entire article to later) is that of sense, alter, and to a lesser extent, control.  These cards rely on having multiples of each in your deck, and in fact reinforce the efficiency of each other. However, due to thier high destiny, the higher the number of alters and senses included in the deck, the higher ability characters must be included in the deck to facilitate usage. That is why sense/alter is most effective in mains decks (and why it provides a neat example of efficient overlap of substrata); because it is included in a strategy that already is based on disruption, and comes prepakaged with the prerequisites of cards to further the main strategy in their own substrategy (sense/alter are in essense disruption cards although they can cause damage). Therefore, efficient deckbuilding requires the 'overlapping' of strategies.<br>

Hope you enjoyed the strategy for today... This will be an ongoing series of articles, hopefully daily (but im sure ill miss some).. Tommorow comes the big one, draw percentages (the least understood principal of all time i think, or at least the most miss-applied). After that ill deal with individual card efficieny (a function of draw percentages and overlapping substrategies.. not as simple as deploy/forfeit or something silly)... So look out, and i hope these are helping people.. If theres anything youd like me to discuss or you have any comments feel free to mail me either through decktech, or at my regular email (XjedeyeX@aol.com)..<br>
