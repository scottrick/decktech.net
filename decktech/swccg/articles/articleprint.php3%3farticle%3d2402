I am absolutely amazed at what Alex Tinnek (hope I got that name right) has done for Black Sun decks and would like to congratulate him.  He does a good job explaining the Pros of Black Sun and the Cons, but I will go into a little more detail.<br>
<br>
At first glance, this objective looks to be the worst one out there.  What?  You can&#146;t deploy lots of your favorite Dark Side characters?  What about Vader?  What about Mara Jade?  Relax.  You have plenty of excellent characters.  What do most Court decks use?  Bounty Hunters.  Any other characters?  If so, not many.  So, you have almost exactly the same character base as Court, which is excellent.  Xizor is also deployed in the very beginning of the game.  You can flip the objective before the game starts or on the 1st turn after you get a generic docking bay to Coruscant and move him over.  So, you get a quickly flipping objective with massive bonuses on the flip side.  Let&#146;s look at those:<br>
<br>
First of all, on the 0 (and on the 7 side) you may make a regular move to a site of a bounty.  This is huge!  Say they have Jedi Luke and Han with Blaster farting around at the Cantina.  You deploy a bounty on Han.  You have a large force at this adjacent site, so they don&#146;t want to move.  On your control phase, you move over and knock off Luke with Sniper with one of the tracked cards you used from your flipped objective.  Now all there is is lonely Han, waiting to die.  You battle him, make him lose tons of cards, collect his bounty, and keep him locked up so they can&#146;t deploy him again.  That&#146;s just an example...<br>
<br>
Take a card from hand and place it used pile to examine Force pile cards.  Here&#146;s an instant Janus Greejatus to track your destinies and look at the cards and see if you want to draw.  Good enough.<br>
<br>
During your battle phase, may look at the top x cards of any reserve deck, where x=number of locations you occupy.  Holy moly!  This rocks!  Let&#146;s say you have Jodo Kast with Boba Fett&#146;s Blaster Rifle (I love this combo) with Dr Evasen &amp; Ponda Baba.  Say they have Leia with Blaster, Luke Jedi Knight, and Han with Blaster there.  You occupy 3 locations, which is not hard.  You look at YOUR destinies.  You notice a 4, 3, and another 3.  Easy enough to get those destinies, isn&#146;t it?  Notice that Jodo Kast adds 2 to the weapon destiny his first shot.  And notice that Boba&#146;s Rifle adds 1 itself.  So that&#146;s +3!  FOR FREE!  So, with an easy 4, you knock off Jedi Luke (lost because of Evasen).  Then, you add 1 to each draw.  first you shoot Han, since that&#146;s a 3+1 = &gt; that Han&#146;s defense.  He&#146;s lost.  Since you don&#146;t need to shoot Leia (you want them to suffer battle damage) you don&#146;t need to target again.  So, with this part of the objective, you can easily tell who you&#146;re gonna shoot and when, so you can maximize efficiency of your weapons and battle destinies (if you can battle at multiple areas).<br>
<br>
For each Black Sun Agent in battle, attrition is +1 against opponent.  Wow.  3 characters + a 3 battle destiny = death to all mains EXCEPT Jedi Luke, with his saber, alone.  And that&#146;s not THAT common.  Combined with the blasting of his characters, that&#146;s one hell of a card.<br>
<br>
The direct damage isn&#146;t important.  It&#146;s a wussified version of Profit.<br>
<br>
Ok, so I realize that Luke makes your objective flip.  Those were just examples, and could happen with any character.  Or he&#146;s at Chirpa&#146;s Hut or something, it doesn&#146;t matter.  He&#146;s gonna die sooner or later!<br>
<br>
I hope this helps to those non-believers.  One again, check out Dark Surgeon.  It is the best there is (except maybe my Jodo combo?  :-) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
