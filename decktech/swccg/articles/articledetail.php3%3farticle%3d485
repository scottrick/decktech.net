You're standing around with your buddies somewhere when one of you spots a group of beautiful women walking past.   'Wow', one of you exclaims 'check out that redhead!'<br>
<br>
   'Who?', continues someone else 'I was too busy staring at my future wife...the blonde.'<br>
<br>
   Meanwhile your other friend hasn't heard a word of this blathering because he can't take his eyes off of the brunette.  So what does this have to do with SW:CCG?	Nothing at all, except to establish that the world would be pretty boring if everyone thought the same.<br>
<br>
   Having established that everyone has different tastes, how should that matter when trying to rate what a good deck looks like?  I mean, we all know how to play the game right?  Shouldn't we be able to tell which decks will haul ass and which decks look like they were put together by the love child of Fabio and Helen Keller? ( my apologies to all those Helen Keller fans who should not have to read her name anywhere near the likes of Fabio's)  The answer I'm beginning to see is no, we are all bias to our personal preferences, our own likes and dislikes that affect not only how we rate the decks we see here, but also how we go about creating our own decks.<br>
<br>
   I am relatively new around here.  I say that with no hesitation or apologies.  I have spent the last few days submitting some of the decks I play to boost my rating to the required level to throw my two cents in at whatever I feel like.  Good decks that strike my fancy, and bad decks that make me want to poke my eyes out, forever stained as they are for ever having seen the wretched filth that littered the landscape of this website.  Maybe I don't have the background knowledge of the game, I am only rated about 1700 at the tournament level.	Maybe I don't have enough experience to know what a real good or bad deck looks like, I have only looked at maybe 35- 50 decks or so around here( not including the thousands I've seen and played against in real life).  That may be the case, and yet still I can't help but feel prejudiced against some of the decks I see because of the way I like to play the game.<br>
<br>
   Before I go any further, I would like to say that I consider myself to be a very objective person.  I am not quick to anger or judge, and I like to consider all sides of an argument before I render my well founded opinion.  That being said, some decks I see just don't do it for me because I can't help but feel that they are 'cheap' or 'weak' or just not the kind of deck I would play.  Some may say that's why we rate decks.  So that all kinds of different people with different ideas and backgrounds can give their opinions on what they see.  Granted, but is it an accurate depiction of the overall strength or quality of the product we see in front of us?  And is that not what this is all about when it comes to rating decks that we see here?<br>
<br>
   Star Wars is a very complicated and involved game.  It is this fact that first attracted me to the game over and above all other ccgs.  It could be said that a lot of games are over before they begin.  With a well constructed, well thought out deck, almost surely defeating the poorly planned, hastily thrown together deck.	I defy anyone to show me a 60 card deck that can handle ANY deck that can be thrown against it.  Any strategy that the opponent has come up with.  Any card that by itself, or with any other combo card cannot tip the balance of the game in the other direction almost permenently.	And it is with this knowledge that it becomes ever more difficult to accurately gauge the strength of the decks we see.<br>
<br>
   Perhaps the most glaring example of bias towards one deck or another is the diferences between regions.  I have not faced a Rescue the Princess deck in tournament play.  Nor have I faced Turbo sanctuary for well over a year.  Similarly I have not faced a dedicated CPI deck for awhile either.  Yet does that mean that people elsewhere do not still swear by these types of deck still.  Be honest now,  if someone showed up at your next tournament with a modernized Asterioid sanc.  Complete with battlegrounds to combat CHYBC,  how would most people fare against it?  They would probably get stomped like Rocker on the 7 train.  My point being that different decks in different places are more effective than others because of the types of decks that they are playing against.  And it is the bias towards the better decks in your area, or the better decks that you have seen win personally, that influence how we all rate the decks we see here on DeckTech.<br>
<br>
   Another mitigating factor to deck rating is our own personal philosophy when it comes to the art of deck construction.  I like to take a more passive stance in many of the decks I build.  I try to create overall balanced decks with good combat capability and some retrieval, light and dark.  I try to make sure that there is nothing that can disrupt the entire flow of my deck, and that come what may I will have a chance to win against any deck or any player.  Yet that is not always the way decks get built.  Just last week I played in a local tournament where one of my opponents brought a Dagobah clouds type deck.  I was playing my Raltiir Ops deck( check it out if you want...Raltiir Ops...the Forgotten Objective), my opponent almost cried when I pulled CHYBC from my reserve and boned his entire operation.  '%$#k!' he exclaimed' no one I play with plays with that card!'<br>
<br>
   I would have had a real tough time if I wasn't packing CHYBC,  but that is not my point.  My point is that my opponent was not expecting that card because it was his experience of not really seeing that card around his gaming circle, combined with his philosophy of designing a deck that does a certain thing come hell or high water that caused his eventual loss to me.  Which leads into the other philosophy of deck design that I do not subscribe to.  That being the 'I am going to do this' philosophy.  The merits of the opposing schools of thought should be subject to another article, my point being that again different ideas about the game lead to different ratings of the decks we see.<br>
<br>
   What is the point of all this?  Anyone reading this probably hasn't heard anything they haven't thought of at one time or another.  Why rate decks at all?  This may be how many rebut the statements I have made.  I will finally conclude by saying this.  My overall point is to increase awareness to all of us who would impose our opinion on the lot of us who share our ideas in this forum.  Try to remember that a deck is formed from the playing experience of the designer to win in areas around where he plays and that the overall strength of the deck should be regarded as objectively as possible by all.  If everyone who reads this becomes a little more objective, and a little more constuctive in the types of ratings they give decks here.  Then I think it was worth the time for me to write this.  Of course a nice high rating would equally validate my time.
