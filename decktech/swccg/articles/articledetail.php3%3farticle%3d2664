That makes 583 playable characters total: 294 LS, 289 DS and even more are coming out with each new set. However the average tournament level player only plays somewhere between 10-20 characters a deck or between 20-40 characters total, usually with multiples of certain cards. That means there are over 500 characters not selected. How do you know you picked the right ones? This article is meant as an overview of characters that are quite good and never really see much play and those that could be a bit better and see too much table time. I&#146;ve limited myself to three shoulds and three shouldn&#146;ts in each major category. If you have some you want mentioned please state them and the reasons in your reviews. Please just don&#146;t trash this because a card you play is on the shouldn&#146;t list or a card you hate is on the should. Any card can be good in the right deck, this is just stating some cards are too often played in all decks and some are played too little in all decks.<br>
Light Side: Aliens&amp;#8230;<br>
Gets no love:<br>
BoShek<br>
Power: 2 Ability: 4<br>
Adds three to power of any starship he pilots. May be targeted as a smuggler by Kessel Run. Immune to attrition &lt; 3. This guy isn&#146;t played that often and I don&amp;#8217;t know why. He is one of only four aliens with ability 4 (Tawss, Melas, B&amp;#8217;omarr), which is huge. He is also only one of 4 aliens that add three to power of ships (Dash, Lando C. only on Falcon, and Leslomy). To top all that he does have immunity to attrition &lt; 3, which isn&#146;t much but is better than none.  He is very versatile as many interrupts and effects can target him (Fall of the Empire, Weapon Levitation, Meditation, Uncontrollable Fury, Yoda&amp;#8217;s Glimmer Stick, and Advantage). He is also good at adding enough ability to stop Zuckuss in the Mist Hunter cold. <br>
Wicket (that Ewok)<br>
Power: 1 or higher    Ability 2<br>
Deploys only on Endor. Power and forfeit +1 for each Light side icon at same Endor site. When in battle, may target one opponent&#146;s character present. Draw destiny. Target excluded from battle if destiny &gt; ability.  This furious little fur ball is a nice addition to any deck that at least plays the Landing Platform. His built in text is gold, a mini-version of Lando with Vibro-Ax. The uses of this little guy are many and he can be pulled like any other scout.<br>
Ishi Tib <br>
Power: 1 Ability: 1 Armor: 3<br>
Power +1 at any swamp. During your draw phase, may place one card from your hand on bottom of Used Pile to draw a card from Reserve Deck. Granted these guys aren&amp;#8217;t the strongest guys in the galaxy but there text is money. They practically double your odds of drawing up the cards you want. Do you see the words &amp;#8220;once per turn&amp;#8221;? You draw a card you don&amp;#8217;t need place it in used, draw from reserve deck, lather, rinse, repeat. You can do this until you run out of cards in you Reserve deck, but hey you&#146;re about to recycle anyway.<br>
Get too much love:<br>
Mirax Terrick:<br>
Power: 2 Ability: 2<br>
Adds 2 to power or anything she pilots. When piloting [Pulsar Skate], draws one battle if not able to otherwise. Once per turn, may use 1 Force to place a card from hand on bottom of Used Pile and draw top card of Reserve Deck. One of the most overrated cards in the game. Her stats save for forfeit are mediocre. She isn&amp;#8217;t even the best pilot that matches her own ship (Wedge). Other pilots can utilize her ship&amp;#8217;s game text better concerning Kessel Runs. Her game text while useful is outdated by the new threepio and is useable only once a turn. Even in WYS decks there are better choices. <br>
Figrin D&amp;#8217;an<br>
Power: 1 Ability: 1<br>
Once each turn during your control phase, you may use 1 Force to make a &quot;wager.&quot; Draw three destiny. Opponent draws two destiny. Player with highest total may randomly select one card to be retrieved from that player&#146;s Lost Pile. Come on people, this guy is old school and should stay there. There are far too many better and easier ways to retrieve now. This guy is really a wasted card slot. Even a musician or gambler deck could probably find a better replacement. <br>
Oola<br>
Power: 1 Ability: 1<br>
During your control phase, may cause opponent to reveal entire hand by using X Force, where X = number of cards in opponent&#146;s hand. All unique (*) male Imperials or unique (*) male aliens there are placed in opponent&#146;s Used Pile. I admit it, I used to love this card and added it to almost every deck I built&amp;#8230; unfortunately I never got to use her that much. Her text is great but near impossible to use, as you must draw her up, deploy her, defend her and pay for the text. She seldom gets to actually use her text efficiently. If you must use her, try a musician deck or maybe a shocking information/grimtaash deck.<br>
Get not love&amp;#8230;<br>
Dark Side aliens:<br>
Dannik Jerriko<br>
Power: * (1 or more) Ability: 3<br>
Once per battle, may use 1 Force to &quot;eat the soup&quot; of (place out of play) one opposing non-droid character lost or forfeited at same site. *Power = 1 + ability of all victims whose soup was eaten. This guy can really make an opponent cry. Many say the difference between his deploy and forfeit makes him to risky. Well why forfeit him unless he is hit and if he is than you&amp;#8217;ve only lost 2 forfeit rather than 6-8 from another character. With Dr. Evazan and a weapon at the same site this guy is money. You shot or chop Luke or some other main, Evazan operates on them and Jerriko puts them out of play and adds their ability to power. Mara and Dr. E are already in common use, adding in Jerriko just turns the knife a little. Amanaman is also a man to team up with. <br>
Kithaba<br>
Power: * (1 or more) Ability: 2<br>
*Power = 1 + ability of opponent&#146;s highest-ability character present. Deploys only on Tatooine. Adds 1 to power of any starship he pilots. Kithaba the assassin is the man especially when armed with a Vibro-Ax. Is Qui-Gon giving your aliens a headache? Kithaba will take him out proper with one good Vibro ax swing. Luke and Obi wan are also good targets. With the introduction of the new Jedi Masters this guy should definitely see action.<br>
Salacious Crumb<br>
Power: 0 Ability: 1<br>
Opponent may initiate battle at same site for free. At same or adjacent site, whenever an opponent draws a card for battle destiny, if it is: Even, opponent must use 1 Force (if possible)| Odd, destiny card is lost. (AH-hahahahaha!) First the opponent laughs at you for playing this and then you laugh at his misfortune. This annoying little worm is pure tech, and with Abyss out as well you make the opponent really weep. Most characters are odd numbers and even without abyss working this makes them lost. How many decks play those pesky recycling 5&#146;s? Even even numbers make the opponent lose force they were saving for next turn. Put this devil at a well-defended site and use Abyss for best results.<br>
Get too much love:<br>
Jabba the Hutt<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 4<br>
Deploy -2 at Tatooine or Nal Hutta. To move requires +2 Force. May escort a captive. While at Audience Chamber, adds 1 to forfeit of all your other aliens and allows you to activate 1 Force for whenever you Force drain with an alien. Immune to attrition &lt; 4. Yes, nothing is sacred; I&#146;m saying this version of Jabba isn&#146;t worth it. He is in most ways inferior to his other personas and costs more to deploy. His bonuses aren&#146;t as useful as those of SE Jabba and the powerful Mighty Jabba. All in all if you need a Jabba in your deck I&#146;d pick one of the others. Still this card sees lots of play, perhaps because the users have no other Jabbas.<br>
Ree-Yees<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 3<br>
Thrice per battle at same site, if you just drew a battle destiny of 3, may use 3 Force to add 3 to that destiny. Oh yeah, can&#146;t even count the number of times my DS deck has drawn three battle destinies in one battle and all of them were threes and I had nine force left over to use this card. Dear lord this card is played too much and why? His game text almost never happens and when it does, when does the dark side have that much force in reserve. In decks like Black Sun this character may be a little useful if a three ever comes up, but on the whole this guy should be scrapped for a permanent weapon bounty hunter or maybe Aurra Sing.<br>
Outer Rim Scout<br>
Power: 2 Ability: 2<br>
Deploy -1 to your [Independent] starship. Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots. When piloting a [I] starship, instead adds 3 to power and draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. Suspends Asteroid Sanctuary at related sector. In a good deck with a specific purpose in mind for them, these guys are still good. However, too many people are using this card in unneeded places and wasting deck space. I&#146;ve seen too many people playing these as backup space power. They don&#146;t work like that unless you&amp;#8217;ve got one hell of a messed up strategy going on. Until Decipher makes a non-unique DS independent starship with pilot space available, these guys should hit the closet in most decks (not all though).<br>
Light Side Rebels&amp;#8230;<br>
Who get no love:<br>
Firin Moreyy<br>
Power: 2 Ability: 2<br>
Subtracts 2 from deploy cost of each of your starfighters to same docking bay. Once during each of your control phases, may take one Advanced Preparation, Rebel Planners or docking bay into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. I&#146;ve never seen this character played in any deck and that&#146;s a real shame. He lowers the cost of your starfighters and acts like an Insurrection that doesn&#146;t kill Nabrun Leids. A great card for many decks.<br>
Major Panno<br>
Power: 2 Ability: 2<br>
While at a system or an exterior battleground site, allows you to activate up to 2 additional Force for each related exterior battleground site you occupy with a scout (limit 4 additional Force). This guy already sees some play in Endor decks but he should see even more. He can be pulled with Madine and next turn allows you to activate 4 extra force. It really rocks; he can even do it from orbit. Too many commonly used scout cards are used not to also use this guy.<br>
Sergeant Junkin<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 2<br>
When at Bunker, adds 1 to Deactivate The Shield Generator total for each Explosive Charge here. When Junkin uses a Concussion Grenade, all your characters are immune to that grenade and you may add or subtract 1 from weapon destiny draw. Many people are all bragging about how cool Jar-Jar is because he is like &quot;the bomb&quot;. Jar-Jar&#146;s got nothing on this demolitionist. Arm this bad boy with a Concussion Grenade and watch a whole troop of DS mains go down the drain. An deck using beatdown strategy should use him as should any deck with Crix Madine.<br>
Get too much love&amp;#8230;<br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi<br>
Power: 5 Ability: 6<br>
When present at the start of a battle, may use 1 Force to cause one opponent&#146;s character of ability = 1 (your choice) to move away (for free) or that character is immediately lost. Immune to attrition &lt; 5. Umm&amp;#8230; okay this dude blows. Sure he can deploy places other than Tatooine, but come on the game text of this guy reads like an obituary. What decent dark side that hasn&#146;t been destroyed by some hosing effect (Ralltir, Operatives) plays ability 1 imperial characters. Sure he&#146;s got some immunity to attrition but he&amp;#8217;s a Jedi, the enemy is going to be swinging and shooting at him and immunity will mean jack. Use Ben, Padawan, or maybe Obi with LS. Obi with LS is good if you play no Tatooine sites and Ben is good if you play at least the docking bay. I wouldn&#146;t advise using Padawan unless you&amp;#8217;re playing some serious Tatooine. <br>
General Solo<br>
Power: 4 Ability: 3<br>
Deploys -2 on Falcon, Tydirium or Endor. Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots. When in battle with Chewie (or another of your scouts at an exterior site), may use 2 Force to cancel one opponent&#146;s battle destiny just drawn. Immune to attrition &lt; 3. As I said nothing is sacred. This guy is used way, way, way too much. This in my opinion is because of to factors: Strike Planning and Profit. Far too many people use Strike Planning to pull good old General Solo and it&#146;s kind of silly. Effects like Strike Planning where designed to add the setup process of decks&amp;#8230; does Solo do that? No, he&#146;s just another over-used main to play. Save your second Strike Planning pull for something more important, like redeploying Crix Madine when a DS hit squad crushes his site. Many people also mistakenly deploy Gen. Solo at the start of Profit. This is usually because they think his ability to cancel a battle destiny with Chewbacca will keep him alive longer&amp;#8230; not really. When Han does die it&#146;s usually to weapon-fire and Gen. Solo doesn&#146;t cancel weapon destinies. Use EPP Han people, he&#146;s got a weapon and adds a destiny with Luke&amp;#8230; the guy who deploys for free with Profit and can use Jedi interrupts to protect him. I&#146;m not sure Gen. Solo belongs in an deck except a hardcore scout deck.<br>
Chewie With Blaster Rifle<br>
Power: 6 Ability: 2<br>
Adds 3 to power of any freighter he pilots. Adds one battle destiny if with C-3P0. Permanent weapon is blaster rifle (may target a character of creature for free| draw destiny| target hit, and its forfeit = 0, if destiny &gt; defense value). An EPP character&amp;#8230; how can one of them be over used? I&#146;m sorry my friends but it&#146;s true. This version of Chewbacca just doesn&#146;t deserve to be played as much as it is today. For one thing his defense value is just bad for a main and he has the lowest forfeit of any persona of Chewie except of course &quot;Chewie&quot; (who just should never be played). But, but&amp;#8230; he has a permanent weapon and adds a destiny. Well that&#146;s true but his permanent weapon is the worst (no bonus to hit) and he adds a destiny with threepio who really shouldn&#146;t be anywhere near a battle, especially the new Tatooine one that has such cool tech. Any other Chewbacca would probably be better and if you insist on a weapon use his bowcaster (it&#146;s a lightsaber without the force drain bonus). <br>
Dark Side Imperials<br>
Who get no love:<br>
Darth Vader<br>
Power: 6 Ability: 6<br>
When in battle, adds 1 to each battle destiny. Adds 3 to power of any starship he pilots. Adds 4 to power and 3 to maneuver when piloting Vader&#146;s Custom TIE. Immune to attrition &lt; 5. This is perhaps the least played Vader in the game and he needn&#146;t be. While he may not have the shear battling power of Lord Vader or DLOTS nor the permanent weapon of Vader with Lightsaber, this persona still has its merits. For one thing it is a good choice for a deck with low or few destinies, but that&#146;s not my point. Too many dark side space decks use Vader w/LS when this should be their card. This man rocks in space especially in his custom tie and he can add to destinies there too. If they play &quot;There is good in him&quot; pick up Luke and head for the stars, don&amp;#8217;t fight it out on the ground with forces stronger than you.<br>
Royal Guard<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 2<br>
Deploys only on Coruscant or to Emperor&#146;s site (or related site). When armed with a Force pike and defending a battle, adds one battle destiny. Emperor may not be targeted by weapons unless all Royal Guards present with Emperor are &#146;hit&#146;.  I&amp;#8217;ve always liked these guys and they deserve it. Their non-unique, have good power and ability, have a decent destiny number, low deploy not hurt by &quot;the camp&quot;, and add destinies with their already menacing force pikes. Despite all this they see little play time. Why? The deployment restriction has hinder many as Coruscant isn&#146;t yet a major planet and the emperor tends to not need defending. They are still useful in many decks and any deck with multiple Emperors should consider them. With the new Coruscant locations introduced in the next set, maybe they&#146;ll get the time they deserve. Note: Precision Targeting + Royal Guard+ Force Pike = 0 Power, 0 Forfeit enemy and a bonus destiny.    <br>
The Emperor<br>
Power: 4 Ability: 7<br>
Deploys only to Coruscant or Death Star II. Never moves to a site occupied by opponent (even if carried). If Vader of Xizor here, and Luke is not on table, adds 2 to attrition against opponent at other locations. Immune to attrition. This card doesn&#146;t see much play because it&#146;s other persona is more versatile. However any BHBM or AOTBS should have at least one of this guy. Against LS decks that isn&#146;t likely to play many Lukes this guy is murder. Training and space decks really take some hurt from him.  <br>
Get too much love&amp;#8230;<br>
Captain Gilad Pellaeon<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 3<br>
Deploys for free to Thrawn&#146;s location. Each other Imperial aboard same capital starship is forfeit +2. Adds 2 to power of any capital starship he pilots (3 if [Chimera]). While aboard [Chimera] with Thrawn, also adds 2 to the starship&#146;s armor and hyperspeed. Come on people, how many decks is this guy even close to useful against. The Thrawn/Chimera is just fine without this lackey and yet at every tournament I see him played. When I ask why, the answer is always the same. He&#146;s great forfeit fodder. Well isn&#146;t that nifty; you&#146;re wasting a whole card slot that could be held by an actually useful character for extra forfeit fodder. Do you play &quot;Admiral Ozzel&quot; too? Come on use cards to use them, not to lose them. If you choose to use this guy, make sure it&#146;s because you think the Chimera will need a hyperspeed of 5, armor of 8, or more added power. Most of the time it will need none of these.<br>
General Veers<br>
Power: 3 Ability: 3<br>
Power +1 when at same site as Admiral Ozzel. Imperials at same Hoth site are power +1. Adds 3 to power of any combat vehicle he pilots. On Blizzard 1, also adds 1 to armor and draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. If your playing one of the cool new walker garrison decks this guy is great, if not you probably don&#146;t need him. I&#146;m sorry to say it but Veers is not that great a card even on Blizzard 1. Good old Commander Igar has him totally outmatched. In fact the only real reason to play Veers is to team him with Igar and the benefit of that is questionable at best. If you like &quot;Trample&quot; please just use Igar and Tempest 1&amp;#8230; they are so much better. Endor AT-ST&#146;s are also good.<br>
Kir Kanos <br>
Power: 5 Ability: 3<br>
When armed with a Force pike, adds one battle destiny. Once during each of your deploy phases, lose 1 Force or place Kanos and cards deployed on him in owners Used Pile (if Emperor on table, may use 1 Force instead). When I first saw this guy, I thought he was gold, but a few times playing with him taught me better. While powerful, this guy just isn&#146;t worth it. His own game text makes him a real pain. If the Emperor is not out, you are losing one force every turn he is on the table. If the Emperor is out, you have to remember to pay one force a turn for him. With the current dilemma of dark side force generation, this guy is just unplayable. It&#146;s actually in your opponent&#146;s interest to let this guy live. <br>
From here things get shorter as there are fewer droids than other characters. Also I won&#146;t speak on Jedi, Maul, Republics, Alien/Imperials, Alien/Rebels, or DS Rebels as there are too few right now and most are good or just unusable (Frozen Han) in most decks.<br>
Droids <br>
Who get no love:<br>
LS R2-D2<br>
Power 1<br>
While aboard any starfighter, adds 2 to power, maneuver and hyperspeed (3 on Red 5). If at a Scomp link when opponent draws destiny of: 1-3, you may activate one Force. 4-6, you may draw top card from Reserve Deck. Now that people are playing Threepio with his parts showing more than the combo card, this guy can come back out of the box. His game text makes him a great card to put alone with Threepio at a Scomp Link site. Against the new podracing decks this guy is even better cause he either gives you extra cards or force during your control phase.<br>
DS R2-Q2<br>
Power: 1<br>
While aboard any starfighter, adds 1 to power, maneuver and hyperspeed. When at a Scomp link during your draw phase, may use 1 Force to look at top three cards of your Reserve Pile. Does the opponent keep Bith Shuffling your well-stacked destinies? Can you not remember whether that Visage is the third or fourth card in your Reserve deck? R2-Q2 solves this problem easily by letting you see your destinies before you draw them and if you get shuffled after you look, you can use another force to look again. This droid is great for decks like Hunt Down that require you to know your own destinies ahead of time. <br>
Get too much love&amp;#8230;<br>
LS LE-BO2D9<br>
Power: 2 Armor: 4<br>
May be battled. While aboard any freighter, adds 2 to hyperspeed and may draw one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. If you have completed Rycar&#146;s Run or Kessel Run, opponent loses 1 force (2 if both) during each of your control phases. For some reason I see this droid a lot. This droid just isn&amp;#8217;t that useful unless your doing lots of space Runs, which are really to hard to pull off these days and beyond that the ship he goes with puts them out of play when you finish them so I&#146;m not sure he&#146;s a good choice. Unlike other droids, leaving him alone anywhere could also prove very unfortunate.<br>
DS Sith Probe Droids<br>
Power: 1<br>
When deployed, immediately retrieve 1 Force. Limit 1 Sith Probe Droid per location. If present with Amidala during your control phase may use 3 Force to relocate this Sith Probe Droid to Maul&#146;s site, and relocate Maul to same site as Amidala. [Episode I] I know everybody is excited by the force retrieve involved, but close inspection of this card and the ones attached to it lead to some major problems. Maul&#146;s Epic Event uses these droids but they are pretty useless if the opponent plays no Amidala. Probe Droid effects work on them, but why not just use regular Probe Droids. Many droid effects work with them too, but they work on all other droids as well. In the end they use up to many card slots and do very little. A proposed Cloud City droid retrieving site Idea might reduce their numbers of them in your deck but that would mean using 2-4 force a turn to retrieve one force because with &quot;Aim High&quot; out you pay two more for both retrieving with the droid and retrieving the droid itself. These droids are really not that good. <br>
Well I hope this article has been informative for you and given you something to think about in terms of your card selection. If you did like this article, I will be soon post Classics and Clunkers of Star Wars CCG: Starships and Vehicles, Pistols and Peashooters of Star Wars CCG: Weapons and Devices, Procedures and Paradoxes of Star Wars CCG: Effects and Interrupts, and finally Clockwork and Chaos of Star Wars CCG: Objectives and Epic Events. The first two will not deal with Coruscant Cards, the last two will. If you didn&#146;t like this article, don&#146;t read the others&amp;#8230; unless you just feel like rating something bad&amp;#8230; which is okay I guess&amp;#8230; it is after all just a game.  <br>
