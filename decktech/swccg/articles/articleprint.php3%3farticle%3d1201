<br>
Getting into the Star Wars CCG may seem like a daunting task to you at first, since it seems like every deck has about 40 rares in it and you have 5 rares total.  The game is actually easier to start than you may think.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick list of things to remember:<br>
<br>
1.  You don't need a ton of rares to make a good deck.  This is one thing so many beginners do not realize.  All they can think of is that they will never have a good deck unless they have 3 vaders and 3 obi's.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! I recently came in second at a tourney were both of my decks combined had only 3 mains!!!  There are many good cards that are not rare, in fact there are many commons that veteran players could never live without.<br>
<br>
2.  Don't make decks too specific.  I remember my first deck.	It had walkers and target the main generator, but I also had bounty hunters and the death star with commence primary ignition.	This is biting off way more than you can chew!	The key to deckbuilding is to have a focused goal with which you follow.<br>
<br>
3.  Don't waste card slots with useless cards!  Follow your deck theme and don't put in cards in there for useless situations which are unlikely to happen in a tournament.<br>
<br>
4.  Look at other people's decks.  This can start giving you good ideas on what cards work with what other ones and what strategies work.<br>
<br>
5.  Remember one of the keys of playing the game is the versatility of your deck.  The more situations your deck can deal with the better you will do.	It's as simple as that.<br>
<br>
6.  Talk to older players.  Another players insight can help you immensly.<br>
<br>
If you follow these guidelines you can be well on your way to being a better player.<br>
