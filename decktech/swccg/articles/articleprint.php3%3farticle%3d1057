<br>
<br>
It is an invaluable resource of SW CCG information from around the world, giving you a glimpse of the playing styles of players thousands of miles away, the decks they play, and their experiences in tournaments wither they be locals or a world class one like a Grand Slam.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the group of people who have a problem with Decktech see it as causing one big problem wiping out small sites the same way a Wal Mart will do in a small town with local shops. Now people will say this is because all of the decks, articles and reports that supplied these little sites went to Decktech, when in reality people chose this site because of the quality of decks, the fact it is always being updated and you can have world class players help you out with your deck. Now there are a few sites that have survived because of their uniqueness Beakman's World, Beyond SW CCG Trandosite, and The Fishery, now they all survived for their reasons. (Local Coverage, they have something no one else has. and/or they've been around as long as we all can remember).<br>
<br>
Well now back to Decktech, I'm sure all of us have gone to this site while building a deck to give you a helping hand with making it. Either by seeing what the staples are in the majority of decks, the types of decks that are being played right now, and even perhaps looking over a certain players submissions to find their playing style.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is also great for finding what happened in a huge tournament, which won't be even mentioned, on Decipher for maybe a week after, or finding out who won a local you missed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now people see this rating system as the big trouble of the site, with people getting a poor rating on a deck and no help being given by that user just them saying 'This deck won't work' or 'It's ok' and not many like The problems with this deck is&amp;#8230;. Now while I see a lot of the lets just say more 'experienced' players on decktech giving constructive criticism (wiether this is done because of a prize being given away for best review, I don't know.) Although one of the major problems is players from a certain area (it's cold there) who rate a deck poorly not because it is a bad deck, but because of a dislike for a player or players from a certain area. People also see a problem with the way Clint Hays reviews things, well the way I see things he has a simple way of reviewing a deck if he sees more than 4 or 5 flaws in a deck ** 'This Deck will lose it sucks' if the deck has 2 or 3 flaws he gives it *** 'this deck is ok but it can be beat by&amp;#8230;' and if it only has one flaw he'll give you **** and say this deck is good and perhaps tell you the flaw. Well that's just the way I see things so next time Clint reviews something of yours take a look at this and gain insight into how much work your deck needs before it isn't a waste of Clint's all important time (you'll never get rid of the ego accept it)<br>
<br>
<br>
The Rumors Section, now this is a very useful place wiether it be to get a good laugh or to see spoilers of upcoming cards (I think I saw 2187 on there the real one a week or two ago.)<br>
<br>
<br>
But of course it is a place you can interact with great players from around the world, get ideas from them and exchange stories.<br>
<br>
Now, the things Decktech could use are well Monitors to go around and respond to complaints about reviews which go against the whole point of decktech (like one star reviews with the text being I don't like you so you get 1 star etc.) and a quality control thing if after X number of reviews the deck is under 3 stars it gets deleted etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before you go off and call this article an ass kissing article well it's not I am simply responding to the big Anti-Decktech hoopla on the Discussion BBS yesterday. Although I'd like to thank Neal and David for putting together a great site which has helped enrich the game and giving us a forum for putting our decks, reports and opinions on for everyone to see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I know what I said kinda goes against the title and description and it is more so 'The Way I see it' but I wrote them first so&amp;#8230;<br>
