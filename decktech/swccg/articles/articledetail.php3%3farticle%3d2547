There are many, many strategies and goals toward building decks in Star Wars CCG but to design an effective, comprehensive deck is an art that few accomplish.  Here is something to start you on your way.<br>
<br>
The first thing you want to do is choose a theme. By a theme I don&amp;#8217;t mean something from a movie or a book, but a goal that helps you to win; for example, a semi-decent choice is a dueling deck. Large force draining and/or a lot of battle damage are simple themes, while manipulation combined with force denial and denying retrieving is a complicated thing. Once you have chosen one or more themes, decide on what starters (locations, objectives, starting interrupts and the cards they pull) would best help you accomplish your theme. <br>
<br>
There are two types of decks, objective decks, and non-objective decks. Neither is more effective than the other; non-objective decks are more difficult to build but have much more freedom in choosing cards, while objective decks restrict card space but usually give more and/or better set benefits and advantages.  If you do not have an objective to go along with your theme, that is okay as demonstrated by State champion non-objective decks.<br>
<br>
After choosing what objective/location to play, choose a starting interrupt. It would be almost pure folly NOT to play a starting interrupt since there are no drawbacks, and you have a variety to choose from. Starting interrupts function the same as objectives, they have their disadvantages and advantages. For example, Heading For the Medical Frigate only lets you pull 3 of X specified effects while The Signal and Podrace prep let you pull 1 of many more than X. Podrace Prep though lets you place some Podracing stuff if you feel like it, as does the other DS II Dark Side starting interrupt. And so on and so forth.  One of the more popular decks out right now is podracing with another theme.  I predict that the popularity will wane after a while because Decipher will shoot it out of the sky in a future set, but you never know&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
If you choose to play an interrupt that lets you pull effects (all of them but Combat Readiness, Careful Planning, and Any Methods Necessary) then choose effects that have relevance or greatly enhance your deck theme. <br>
HELPFUL HINT: ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PULL YOUR LOCATIONS!!! <br>
The only decks that should rely on drawing your locations are the ones that don&amp;#8217;t need high destinies or don&amp;#8217;t need the locations for generation or draining.  Only some of the most expert decks are able to pull this off.<br>
<br>
EX: Bring Him Before Me only lets you pull the Throne Room. Besides Merrejk, the only other option you have to pull your locations is Imperial Arrest Order. Common sense dictates that you would play a starting interrupt that lets you pull that. Twi&amp;#8217;lek Advisor, Prepared Defenses, Start Your Engines, Operation As Planned. And so on and so forth. <br>
<br>
TIPS: DS players, if you have a card space, load in You Cannot Hide Forever to pull Mobilization Points instead of playing it right off the bat. That way the Light Side gets a little fuddled and if you draw it in your starting hand then you can pull out another effect. Oh, and don&amp;#8217;t build a deck around being able to use it except to pull out whatever it gives you, for the could just as easily draw its equalizer into their hand. <br>
<br>
Questions to ask yourself when building a deck: <br>
<br>
1) Is this card absolutely necessary toward the running of my deck? <br>
<br>
If a card is necessary for an objective to be put down or flipped then it has a necessity rating of five. The only exception for this is if you are playing a no-flip objective or non-objective deck.  For the objective of Bring Him Before Me, you need Throne Room, Insignificant Rebellion, and Your Destiny. Likewise you need a version of Vader (see choosing cards) to flip the objective. The above cards have a necessity rating of five (out of five) because they are needed to deploy or flip the objective. To complete your objective on the backside you need Vader and the Emperor at the Throne Room with Luke. Now, to complete your objective you need to draw destiny over 12 after Vader loses his duel. Even with the maximum destiny draw of seven, you still have six more points to go. To do this you need to win at the least two battles to boost Insignificant Rebellion (Preferably three or four). Therefore, necessity dictates that you have cards that help you win battles.  The greater these cards, ex: Mara Jade vs. a stormtrooper, the greater their necessity value.  In Bring Him Before Me Jade has a necessity rating of at least 5 and never has a rating of below 4 unless in a pure space deck or in Agents of the Black Sun because she shouldn&amp;#8217;t be used.  Reasons are easy, for she has a power 4 ability 5 that lets you pull a saber and be used in dueling.  On the other hand, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t run Grand Moff Tarkin unless you also have one or more copies of Vader in the deck.  A 4 power 3 ability is not very great unless with Vader.  A necessity rating of 3 max if no Vaders are flying around, but a necessity rating of 4 if 2+ Vaders are on the table.  As for Vader, DO NOT GO THERE.  Vader is a good card, but for some reason considering the anti-vader stuff, his power and ability, and all the combos he is in, I found it almost impossible to rate him.  Note that cards still do not have a great necessity rating even if they are part of a great combo.  I could have 6 Imperial Commanders at six battleground sites but this would only be good if Ral. Ops was on the table with the Admirals Orders that deals 1 damage per commander per battleground site a turn.  <br>
<br>
There is absolutely no set of cards that guarantees that you will win or lose a battle. Most people use combination cards that provide extra battle destinies, power boosts, etc. To choose the non-essential cards in a deck you must first look at its potential usefulness according to your strategy (in this case winning battles).<br>
<br>
2) Power and ability. <br>
<br>
Both of these elements are important in choosing the correct characters in battling (using ex above). Power is an essential element in winning a battle (especially in the deck we are examining above) and ability provides battle destinies and defense value. High power, high ability cards are used in most decks. A higher power is almost always better than a higher ability since tracking has become so easy.  If you can get both in one card, then obviously Mara Jade is better than Kitik Keedkak, even if Kitik has 4 greater power.  The forfeit and ability are so much less.  However, cards with smaller ability can be more useful than cards like Mara Jade and Darth Vader. GOING OFF THE TOPIC OF BRING HIM FOR A SECOND---Take for instance Sergeant Elsek. If I had a couple of biker scouts battling on Endor against a LS Power strike (Han, Leia, Luke, etc) then whom would I want at that site, Mara Jade or Sergeant Elsek? Surprise, Elsek. If forfeited cancels all battle damage and attrition! That kicks. On the other hand, Jade would die and probably have forfeit zero as well. Certain characters are definitely worth putting in most decks, Mara Jade, Emperor Palpatine, and others. However, consider the GAME TEXT of all of your possibilities when slotting as well as their overall worthiness to your theme. <br>
<br>
2) Is their another version of this card (that does the same thing or has the same attributes) which is more effective? <br>
Ex. Should I put Lord Vader, Darth Vader, Vader with Saber, or DVDLOTS in the deck mentioned above. In this case, as with most, it is all from your own point of view (ex: in Bring Him Before Me I would much rather have Lord Vader). However, which would you rather have in a deck, Grand Moff Tarkin, or Tarkin from the Jedi Pack? <br>
<br>
3) Card Combinations: <br>
<br>
Card combinations are all very well and good, but not always necessary. Let us say you have a combination that if such and such Imperial and such and such alien are battling together then you add a battle destiny? Big whoop. There are plenty of other cards that let you do that with fewer restrictions.  Anyway, card combos are well and good if you have a strategy that gets them out efficiently, but otherwise use cards that provide sufficient power, destinies, etc. by themselves can be even more useful. Remember your theme as well, for themes sometimes have certain built-in combos.  <br>
<br>
4) BALANCE, BALANCE, BALANCE <br>
<br>
Never go too top heavy on a certain type of card. For example, anyone with over 40 characters in his deck is almost always a big, BIG idiot. A certain number of each card type in a deck is well applauded, with few exceptions. One of the most common errors I have seen is that people go &amp;#8217;red&amp;#8217; (Interrupt and Effect) heavy in an intent to gain an advantage. DON&amp;#8217;T DO THAT unless you are REALLY good. However many cards you put of a certain type in your deck is your choice, but moderately balance them out and select them for your theme and stand-alone value. A great example of this is Rescue the Princess. 8D8 is a great card for your theme, but Qui-Gon Jinn has no relevance whatsoever. Both are extremely good in the deck. <br>
<br>
5) Spend some time on your deck <br>
<br>
A hastily designed deck will not get you anywhere. Only the &amp;#8217;techies&amp;#8217;, the true masters, can design a deck in 15 min or so. Take time to play test your deck online, at home, etc.  Take deck building hints and strategies from this and other deck building articles.  If you can get a solid deck you need only to modify it with the times rather than totally switch decks for a new set.  A perfect example of this is Jedi Training.<br>
<br>
6)  OD (offense versus defense)<br>
<br>
Usually, decks that are purely defensive with drains of three or less per turn don&amp;#8217;t work.  I can quite honestly say there is no invincible strategy.  A good offensive is a great defense.  If you can keep the enemy jumping and trying to counter your strategy then you very often have the mental edge that helps you to win.  Defensive decks are still very good, ex: QMC, but the best versions are ones that don&amp;#8217;t hole up and produce massive drains, massive direct force loss, or massive battle damage when challenged.  <br>
<br>
7) Tracking<br>
<br>
I am not going to write about this, but I will refer you to this article that will provide much more than I could about this part of the game.  This is the end article in another guys series that is REALLY informative.<br>
<br>
http://decktech.net/swccg/articles/articledetail.php3?article=2391<br>
<br>
8) Counter-cards<br>
<br>
I am not a great believer in loading down your deck with cards that counter specific strategies, but here are a few cards that counter strategies and have all-round great game text that could really help you out.  ALWAYS have at least one grabber in a deck (There Will Be Hell To Pay and What Are They Trying to Push On Us?).<br>
<br>
Don&amp;#8217;t Do That Again (suspends Mob. Points and allows you to pull out your grabbers).<br>
The Camp&amp;#8212;This is not a anti-deck strategy since few Dark decks don&amp;#8217;t run docking bays with Mob. Points.  It is a little more specific to the Tatooine part but is a destiny 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8) Finale <br>
<br>
I realize that decks like Dark Surgeon are extremely good and have a lot of potential, but for an ordinary player they are not worth it. Don&amp;#8217;t spend too much money on these cards unless you are really serious about it. Go out and have fun, but remember stuff like college, dating, saving money (a novelty!), and life.<br>
<br>
Have A Nice Day. <br>
