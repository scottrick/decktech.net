<br>
1) Those people who keep putting out &quot;dream cards&quot; for what Decipher could make if only they extended the game into the book series like &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) Those people who keep complaining about Decipher making cards too powerful without considering the longer reaching ramifications of their creations.<br>
<br>
<br>
First thing to remember: The Rule of Supply and Demand.  For several years, SWCCG was the only real game out there for Star Wars fans.	We ate it all up.  It didn&#146;t matter what broken strategies Decipher sent down the pike, we bought it all and just kept playing because it was all we had.	We demanded more cards, and Decipher was happy to supply them to us in exchange for cash.  However, as more and more cards came out, the rules surrounding them became more and more complicated, thus preventing new players from entering the game.  This created a new problem for Decipher in light of another key economic point:<br>
<br>
Every product has a life cycle.  You can only sell the same thing to the same people for so long, then their needs/wants change and the product begins to dwindle off until it is discontinued.  The key way to combat this is to develop a continuous market.	Take cars for example.	Every year, another million or so adolescents reach driving age and need an automobile.  So even as the older end of your  market stops buying cars or just stops driving altogether, you still have a constant influx of new customers because people will continue to reproduce and those kids will continue to need cars.  Not to mention the older customers who still buy a new car every 3-5 years.  To this end, Decipher created Young Jedi.  Simple enough to be learned by young players, trendy enough to appeal to kids who just got done watching Episode I, and still technically Star Wars so us &quot;old vets&quot; would drop some money on it too.  Turns out they were wrong in almost every aspect of the plan.  Sure, young players could learn it, but younger players only wanted Pokemon.  Yeah, it was coming off the heels of Episode I, but most people were disappointed in Episode I.  And as for the old vets, well, we didn&#146;t want to drop extra money on &quot;Probe Droid Pokemon&quot; when Endor was right around the corner.<br>
<br>
So now, one year after it&#146;s release, Young Jedi is sitting on the clearance rack of virtually every gaming shop in my area.  So much so in fact, those same shops have been leary of ordering ECC, EJP, Third Anthology and the like because they are afraid of Decipher shipping them another dead-end product.  This brings us to Decipher&#146;s newest money sponge, Jedi Knights.  At least give Big D credit for learning from their mistakes.  YJ was too simple, Wars is too complicated, so Jedi Knights will combine aspects of each.  Episode I bombed, so they went back to making the Trilogy again.	And finally Decipher&#146;s biggest lesson.....<br>
<br>
COMPETITION = BAD.  Decipher has learned that while losing your target market to a rival company like WOTC is bad, losing your target market to your own rival product is no help either.  Decipher was counting on the die-hard Star Wars fans to pump the money into YJ.  We didn&#146;t, and Decipher essentially lost a large chunk of their YJ market to SWCCG.  All that product development and promotional money shot, simply because Star Wars fans couldn&#146;t afford to support two games at once.  Now Jedi Knights is coming.  What then would make SWCCG players dump their money into Jedi Knights?  The death of SWCCG.  If Star Wars fans are going to be a &quot;one game only&quot; market, Decipher must first kill interest in SWCCG, before Jedi Knights will ever realize it&#146;s full money sucking potential.<br>
<br>
To this end, you have cards like the much-maligned No Escape/Oonee Ta.	&quot;It kills Honor!&quot;, &quot;It kills ROps&quot;.  I read these things every day.  &quot;The new objectives are so broken!&quot;	Of course they are.  Decipher is doing two things.  One, they are limiting us to two to three primary decks for each side in hopes that lack of creativity and originality will cause many players to drop from the game.  Second, by making the new objectives so broken, it makes the remaining players use/buy the Jabba&#146;s Palace/EJP packs they would love to clear out of their warehouse.  In the meantime, old Cloud City packs will just get shipped out as the sole remaining prize support.  We&#146;re all so busy crying about Decipher&#146;s individual actions regarding this game, that nobody is looking at how all these things work together.<br>
<br>
Jedi Knights and Lord of the Rings are the future of Decipher now, and they know it.  Sure, they&#146;ll keep intermittently producing these SWCCG &quot;side sets&quot; of 30 new cards such as Skywalkers, Scoundrels and the like, because there are enough retards like me out there who will still buy it simply because we want to have a complete set when this is all over.  But prize support is never coming back, playtesting will never be thorough enough, and slowly but surely, SWCCG will just drift off Decipher&#146;s website.  For Decipher, it&#146;s just economically inevitable. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
