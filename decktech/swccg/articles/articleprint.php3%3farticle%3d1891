Allow me to express my personal opinion first and then we will look at the facts.  I like this idea for several reasons.  Well big decipher has announced hat Episode 1 characters and themes will be entering into the classic SWCCG community.  Well, what does this mean?  Darth Maul, Senator Palpatine, Gui-Gon Jinn, Fed Tanks, and a lot of other cool surprises.  This will do a few good things to the game.  Primarily it will expand the games life at least an extra 5 years.  Compared to the current trilogy, each movie received 3+ sets from it, including enhanced cards, promo&#146;s, and sealed decks.  So adding the prequel to the mix will expand the game for at least 9 sets.<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
Now what mechanics can we look forward to?  There has been a lot of talk and sweat about time travel.  I personally doubt that there will be anything like this in the upcoming sets, because the game already has certain time separations within it.	Who has complained about Alderan and the second Death Star being on the table at the same time?  Uhh no - one.	How about Tarkin in Jabba&#146;s Palace? Nope.	Or even Obi-wan throwing down with the Emperor?  These events didn&#146;t happen, and that&#146;s the beauty of the game.  Yes, Decipher makes storyline objectives, rules and other such to keep things somewhat in the box, but the nature of game play allows different confrontations to occur in the SW universe.<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
A lot of people are also anticipating the upcoming book characters.  Well I know that Dash will be in my light deck fighting right beside Obi, hmmm never happened, in fact quite far apart in the timeline!  So what? No big deal Never was and shouldn&#146;t be.  Luke progressed in his jedi-ance, and Jedi Luke now gets to pounce on stormtroopers, tarkin and all the other premiere boys.  So the time line really isn&#146;t an issue.<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
One of the foreseeable problems is Anakin Skywalker.  Where, when, and how ill the podracer pilot evade the forces of evil and how and by what means will the dark side consume him.  This will all be decided by Decipher.  I personally have written my own Anakin Rules to help each side in a balance, which even includes the crossing over of Anakin, causing a - disturbance in the force -.  This would change game play and allow specific characters to enter or leave play, all voluntarily.<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
Now, what else does Episode 1 bring?  Jedimandelorians and a bunch of cool gaming aspects we can expect like more dueling, and pod racing (maybe a ground kessel run, or objective?).  Now the Light side has a large abundance of Jedi on the way.  But outside of the bad boys, Gui-gon, Obi, Mace, Yoda, and Kudi - I see the wrest being transformed into effects or interrupts enhancing other characters or even the jedi themselves.  As far as the dark side, I&#146;d like to see dark jedi training, and maybe 2-3 versions of Darth maul.  At least one as an apprentice (Ability 5) and one Jedi version.  Politics will also take a role in this as Senator Palpatine takes control of the senate.  Hmmm more audience chamber stuff??? Cool!  We also get non-unique E.T.&#146;s (well maybe not).<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
These are things I look forward to these game mechanics to enhance play and the life of the game<br>
<BR><br>
Dark Jedi Testing <BR><br>
Darth Maul <BR><br>
Younger versions of Obi wan <BR><br>
The Jedi Council (objective?) <BR><br>
Pod Racing (retrieval or obj) <BR><br>
Imperial Senate <BR><br>
Anakin Rules (this will force the dark side to look elsewhere other than, big daddy with a stick!) <BR><br>
Continuing the Game (despite how Jedi Knights turns out, I want SWCCG to live longer.  Regardless of how, time will be extended for sure)<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
Hope you liked this and you share my view and anticipation of the new sets.  I mean after all, we can only hope for the best.  And I say having to deal with Jar jar is better than no Swccg at all<br>

My version of Anakin Rules:<br>
<BR> <BR><br>
While vader on Table, anakin my not be played, but just after Anakin Skywalker is played, may deploy a version of Anakin from your deck. If the emperor on table and anakin not at a battle ground site, anakin may not apply game text or ability. The emperor may attempt to cross anakin where present ... by drawing destiny. If destiny + emperors ability > anakins ability + highest ability light character on table + destiny, then Anakin is crossed and there is a &quot;disturbance in the force.&quot; No battles may take place that turn; characters present may escape to used pile. Dark side retrieves force = anakin&#146;s ability. If Vader replacing Anakin, Emperor must be on table. Once deployed. Each player draws &quot;force destiny&quot; Add 1 for every jedi on table and add targets abilities. Higher destiny stays on table. Loser &#146;falls&#146; to used pile. If vader is wins, there is a &quot;disturbance in the force.&quot; No battles may take place that turn; all characters may escape to used pile, if they wish. (Therefore can&#146;t replace and beat the hell out of someone)  Well know soon enough how close, or way off I was<br>
