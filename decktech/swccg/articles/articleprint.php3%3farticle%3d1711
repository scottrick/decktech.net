A mild one but EFFECTIVE<br>
<br>
D-Con is around the corner and I honselty dont care what you idiots rate this.	I have emailed people and watched the discussion Boards and this is FACT.  sorry but this is all and ITHACA college boy can do with the game when he has no cardz.  So if u prep for these decks, YOU WILL DO FINE!!!<br>
<br>
TOP DECKS:<br>
<br>
ROPS - they will activate early with DB's and systems, flip and may slap palpy to drain +1<br>
<br>
TIES - i hate this deck type but people love sitnn at the D* DB like a poo-tang and deploy, retrieve, deploy retieve -consider the gay card AIM HIGH to slow this down<br>
<br>
Deep Space - Big ships around endor.  Landing claw is still big despite that guy, and pof to enhance drains<br>
<br>
Bring B4 - Look at the top deks, there they are<br>
<br>
SCUM - ghetto scum is big.  Look for this deck, with cardz like proj telepathy and light SAC<br>
<br>
3rd 5th marker - very deadly with early on damage and thick sac<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Y4 - its back in all forms, and yes ####'s too.  I have seen this and played it successfully.	Be aware.<br>
<br>
E4 - doned the name E4 by Matt Sokol, this deck is similar to Y4 choke, but its endor, the 4 has nothing to do with it, and you can start 3 effects... its solid<br>
<br>
<br>
EBO - Gary Carmen and TJ Holman play thiers VERY well.	Yellow manace has a good version too.  Its Strong and has lasting power.  You will see this in the finals.<br>
<br>
There is Good in him - covert vader with big battles, and fast ones.  See if the dark plays smart, they can avoid this.  But the speed is killer, as in Steven's deck (nice job).  There will be A LOT OF THIS<br>
<br>
HB - either a swarm deck or fake out for force.  Either way this deck can get the job done, but I dont like starting with all of those cardz.  But still a powerful deck at hand.<br>
<br>
Dagobah - I hate this deck but still its a solid competitor.  Yannik, dominik and other canadians have PROVEN its solid.  I give them props.  Its a tought deck to play but a solid one at heart.<br>
<br>
Ast Sanct. - I have only read 2-3 instances of this deck but it sounds powerful.  VERY fast and deadly.  Look out for this one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AND LASTLY WIERD STUFF....<br>
<br>
hey its out there but i dont know what to post b/c there is so much of it...<br>
<br>
<br>
ok in your reviews of  this FABULOUS article, and when u give me * or ** or god forbid ***.  Tell me where I'm wrong.	Did i miss a deck type?  Or what is HOT and I missed it.  I'll do my best to dig deeper and find the *broaken* decks not on deck tech....<br>
<br>
thanx<br>
