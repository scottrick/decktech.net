If you&#146;re like me, you&#146;ve gotten over the initial elation of a new set and are ready to get down to brass tax.  Tatooine has brought new deck archetypes to the forefront on play on every local or regional area.  The question that is on the tip on everyone&#146;s mind is where do I go from here?  How do I prevent myself from getting smacked down by various decks that I haven&#146;t seen before or haven&#146;t played against much?<br>
	Well, the first step in protecting your game is looking at the types of decks you want to play.  While looking at the deck types in your local meta is also important, your deck should be able to win beyond YOUR local tournament scene and be able to stand on its own when pitted against a deck you are unfamiliar with.<br>
	Ask yourself...what is my deck weak against, both offensively and defensively?  For example, if I&#146;m playing a Watch Your Step deck for the light side, how do I protect myself against a Bring Him Before Me or Hunt Down deck?  On the flip side, what card or cards can my opponent play against my Watch Your Step that will hurt me the most?  <br>
	This article will attempt to look at various deck types that are popular in tournament play right now and analyze how a person can protect themselves against these decks and how to not have your strategy hampered by &quot;magic bullet&quot; cards from your opponent in a post-Tatooine playing environment.<br>
	First up, we&#146;ll look at This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time for the dark side.  This was a popular deck before Tatooine&#146;s release, but has only grown in strength since.  The dark side will porbably be activating at least 10 force a turn on their own by the third turn, so force choke is probably not going to happen without a few Revolutions.  In the event of this, the dark side should be starting Crush the Rebellion and have an Evader/Monnok or two in their deck.  Unfortunately, you will be giving up a lot of force to the light side, epsecially if they are playing with a lot of twix sites.  As the light side, you won&#146;t know right away if the dark side is playing Cloud City Occupation or Dark Deal...or both, so you&#146;ve got to prepare for both.  Jedi Test 1 obliterates Dark Deal, but that requires you to be Jedi Testing.  Menace Fades is probably the best bet to start with or pull out to handle Dark Deal, as long as the light side can meet the requirements.  Also, be wary of a flipping Hidden Base deck that cancels two of your drains a turn.  As the dark side playing Dark Deal, this might be your biggest problem.  Be prepared for this card and know how to work around it.  Ultimatum is another card that is very versatile that can help the light side out with Dark Deal.  However, if you play this and don&#146;t go to Cloud City, expect drains of 8 a turn, and another 3 damage if they&#146;re playing Occupation.  As the dark side, Occupation is definitely a safer bet for damaging your opponent, but centering a deck around Occupation could be disrupted by an Endor Celebration floating around.  Be prepared for this as well.  Your biggest threat as the dark side will be a Quiet Mining Colony deck.  You may want to start the Upper Walkway as your starting site for activation that can&#146;t be converted by a QMC deck.  This might be where Occupation will have its greatest impact for the dark side.<br>
	Next, the TDIGWATT counter part Quiet Mining Colony for the light side.  The new effect from Tatooine, Keeping the Empire Out Forever, is huge for this deck.  You have to flip this objective and that should be your primary goal, then go from there.  There are various forms of QMC around, varying from Pucumir Thryss and big drains to Capital Support and heavy damage.  Most decks play Cloud City Celebration for retrieval and Pathof Least Resistance for beatdowns.  You have to focus on maintaing the system and controlling the ground.  Menace Fades and Battle Plan are big helpers in keeping your opponent in check, so long as you maintain the requirements of both.  Lateral Damage is a big concern in space, so maybe you want to play the Your Insight Serves You Well--Launching the Assault--Admiral Ackbar--Major Hashhn combo, or maybe an Alter will serve you best.  If you rely on interrupts for ground beats, or avoiding them, be prepared for heavy SAC that could own you.  Don&#146;t let your Path of Least Resistance or Narrow Escape be cancelled by Sense.  This is especially important if you face a TDIGWATT deck and are fighting over the same sites.  Wise Advice/Do Or Do Not may not be enough to protect you on this one.  Start the Guest Quarters and wait for your opponent to deploy their Cloud City sites first to convert them, epsecially since they will probably convert Bespin on the first turn.  Don&#146;t worry about activation so much.  It may take an extra turn or two, but you will get good activation from using several double icon sites like the West Gallery and North Corridor.<br>
	What about Walker Garrison?  Well, here&#146;s another deck getting more play from the Tatooine set.  Though, not all decks that start You May Start Your Landing play Walker Garrison (mainly played for quick activation), you have to be prepared to counter it or it will come back to haunt you.  As the light side, Menace Fades is your best option, rendering Walker Garrison virutally worthless.  Sense is another great choice to beat Garrison, but make sure you can win a SAC war if you go this route.  Of course, there&#146;s always Jedi Test 1 too, if you want to test.  Also, watch out for a Hidden Base deck that flips and cancels two of your drains a turn.  What about the direct damage from You May Start Your Landing?  Start Your Insight Serves You Well and ditch it for Honor of the Jedi for early protection.  Beware it isn&#146;t immune to Alter until you occupy two battlegrounds though.  Ultimatum is another option for all around protection, but it can still add up quick with drains of two at each site, plus direct damage from You May Start Your Landing and maybe a Rebel Base Occupation.  As the dark side, these are your main threats.  Be sure you can work around them.  Don&#146;t let you opponent pull Menace Fades on you...prevent them controlling either a battleground site or system...even if you just occupy it.  Get around Honor of the Jedi by occupying more battlegrounds, but sincethere are relatively few on Hoth, consider a Presence of the Force or two.  If your opponent comesto Hoth, or is playing Echo Base Operations, you must be able to overpower them on the ground.  Against EBO, you can either blow away the Main Power Generators, or play Imperial Decree, which would wreck the light side.<br>
	If you play Echo Base Operations, you have to worry about Walker garrison decks.  Most EBO decks are light on ground support, so try not to get overrun.  You can&#146;t just ship everyone up to space after setting up EBO either or your opponent will just march in under the shield and cancel EBO.  EBO is a heavy drain deck, but the maximum damage of most EBO decks is around 12 a turn.  The dark side can out damage you with decks like TDIGWATT, so figure out a way around that by either beating them on their playing field or retreiving like mad.  Be careful of opponents who start Imperial Decree...they will probably invade Hoth and cancel your drain bonuses.  Resistance can curb your damage too and put the odds back in your opponent&#146;s favor.  Find a way around all of these problems and you&#146;re good to go.<br>
	What about Watch Your Step?  Well, this deck actually got more potent with Tatooine...but it also took some hits.  Podracing is a huge factor many WYS decks will take advantage of.  The added retrieval is huge and can swing a game even if the light side got a slow start or bad opening hand.  A new smuggler that hurts combat vehicles, Yotts Orren, is also a nice addition.  But here&#146;s what hurts, Darth Maul and His Name Is Anakin.  His Name Is Anakin not only hurts staging areas force activation, but adds to the deploy cost of all aliens, which is usually half or more of the character selection in a WYS deck.  If you get force choked or don&#146;t activate much because you Podrace and don&#146;t pull other locations for activation, this card will really hurt.  Beware of Darth Maul too.  When he comes down, there are only two characters that can deploy normally from a WYS deck that can battle him, Luke Skywalker and Melas.  He can come down and flip WYS by causing a few low ability smugglers to not occupy a loation.  Against a Bring Him Before Deck, this can be fatal.  It&#146;s not so bad if you can battle Maul and take him out with the added battle destiny, but if BHBM snags Luke, its up to Melas or some other Jedi you pack in your deck that deploys for 11 or more, to save you.<br>
	While on the subject of Podracing, how does one protect against getting hurt by a Podrace.  Well, packing a Sebulba, Teemto or Anakin&#146;s Podracer is not enough.  The best Podracing protecting is to podrace yourself.  Cards like A Step Backwards and Neck and Neck for the light side and Podracer Collision for the dark side are your best protection, but are virtually useless after a Podrace....or if there is no Podrace.  A Step Backwards is huge for Anakin....its destiny five and could drag a race out for a long time, but almost guarantee a victory.  Anakin stacks two, the dark side one, then each player places one in their used pile.  Only Anakin adds to his total.  However, watch out for Podracer Collision ffrom the dark side to take a race destiny from the light side.  Too Close For Comfort cancels this though and is very versatile after a race by surprising EPP Vader or Mara or Maul by making them pay to swing their sabers.  Most effective for either side is Secret Plans or Aim High if they don&#146;t expect to win the race.  Alteast make them pay to retreive, which could cost them a turn of deploying.  Pit Crews, Hit Racer and Neck and Neck are also big, but require either the fate of a destiny draw or a very close race.  <br>
	Hunt Down and Destry the Jedi is perhaps the most consistent deck to date.  Every time Decipher makes a card to hurt Hunt Down, they also make a card to enhance it.  Reflections II is a case in point by giving the light side WYS and the Out Of Commission combo card, but also gave the dark side great characters like Xizor, Guri and Dr. Evazon and Ponda Boba.  Tatooine did exactly the same.  While it gave the light side massive interrupts and effects to cancel deuls, revive Jedi, cross Vader or add to deul destinys, it also gave the dark side a new dark Jedi to play with and some deuling adders of its own.   However, the biggest problem facing Hunt Down is Qui Gon Jinn.  You have to kill him becasue there&#146;s no way to deul him and keep Hunt Down on the table.  The high destiny in most Hunt down decks are the best way to handle Qui Gon, by slicing him, but also opened the gates for Podracing.  As the light side, you have to watch out for the Podrace.  If they start Watto&#146;s Box, you have to win the race or it could be a very quick game.  A 22 force swing coupled with Visage can be deadly.  Cancelling Visage of the Emperor is no guarantee either.  This is Some Rescue is a destiny 6 card that cancels the Out of Commission combo from either placing a card from the lost pile out of play or cancelling Visage.   <br>
	Rebel Strike Team also got a boost from Tatooine with The Shield Is Down.  This is perhaps one of the most potent decks out there because of its ability to move so quickly and pull everything out of the deck.  Strike Planning pulls General Crix Madine who pulls scouts like mad, including Corporal Beezer, who pulls Portable Scanner, which pulls Explosive Charges, and Sergeant Junkin, who helps blow the bunker.  With everything that can be pulled out by this deck, don&#146;t surprised to see a third turn blow of the bunker, but probably more like the fourth turn.  Couple it with Menace Fades, which is easy to pull off from the start, and a Podrace and/or Close Air Support, and this deck can ravage the dark side.  Secret Plans is the key to hindering the big force retreival here.  It may cause them to save up a turn or two before blowing the bunker or winning a podrace.  Eliminating Crix before he pulls all his friends is huge too.  As the light side, this could be the biggest thorn to avoid.  A character elimination deck for the dark side, or a heavy space deck that takes over Endor,  may be a good counter to this deck.  <br>
	As for Rebel Strike Team&#146;s counterpart, Endor Operations, new problems have arisen.  Most Endor Ops decks are Ties or space/Imperial Command decks.  RST will allow the light side to invade the bunker and bludgen Ephant Mon.  Commander Merrejk needs to be wary of a Scrambled Transmission and Shocking Revelation combo preventing him from pulling systems.  Tie decks, both Endor Ops and Set Your Course For Alderaan decks, can&#146;t rely on Mobilization points because of magic bullet cards that cancel the text on this card for a few turns. This hampers activation and could ruin a game if relied on from the start.  Battle Plan and Menace Fades could hurt this deck a great deal, depending on how it is set up to damage your opponent.  Perhaps a straight Endor Ops speed deck could catch your opponent off guard, coupled with Closed Door and Perimeter Patrol to hurt RST, but the direct damage this inflicts is limited.<br>
	I apologize that I must stop here, but this article is getting rather lengthy and I still have many decks to touch upon.  Bring Him Before Me, There Is Good In Him, Court of the Vile Gangster (including the Imperial mains version), My Kind of Scum and Profit will have to wait for a bit.  Hopefully this article has been helpful to players looking to construct these kinds of decks, as well as for all who will probably have to face one to give them a heads up.
