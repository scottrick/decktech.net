The two objectives both focuse on space, and blowing away stuff. MBO concentrates on blowing up the Death Star, while SYCFA concentrates on blowing up Alderaan, then anything else they want. This article is for all of you that wish to find strategies and types of MBO and SYCFA decks, and who wish to find some inspiration to even possibly consider building a deck around them. <br>
<br>
     Part one: Massassi Base Operations/One In A Million: <br>
<br>
     0: Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay.<br>
     FOR remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors.<br>
     WHILE this side up, you generate no more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4. <br>
     FLIP this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls fewer than three Yavin 4 sites.<br>
     PLACE out of play if Yavin 4 is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
     7: WHILE this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your total power is +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponent&#146;s Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter present with a polot character aboard are each +2.<br>
<br>
     What this objective does is set up a base on Yavin 4 on the 0 side, and attempts to &quot;blow away&quot; the Death Star on the 7 side. In case you haven&#146;t noticed, there are no flaws in the 7 side, it cannot be flipped back or placed out of play, and still allows you to pull stuff from reserve. Most objectives only allow pulling on the 0 side exclusively, and may be flipped back/placed out of play, and do not provide you with a chance to continue building up. This objective is fairly difficult to set up (just like any other &quot;base&quot; objective), but you reap great benefits from the flip side, and still gain a chance to cause big damage. Whether it be from the +2 drains with pilot/starship pairs, or just plain blowing up DS, you have your options. Also, in case you haven&#146;t noticed, the flip side is EBO and more. It doesn&#146;t reduce your deploy, but it gives you an extra three power in battles at systems, and +2 to your drains. What this objective does not allow you to do is to deploy systems from reserve, with the exception of the Death Star. True, the Death Star is a great drain system, but this objective has trouble with activation, and the Death Star doesn&#146;t help much, just for the opponent. To get around this problem, cheap starships, many Yavin 4 sites, and big activation systems (Dagobah comes to mind) are required to get the most out of this objective. The obvious is to use the Reds from Special Edition and their matching pilots, so you are guaranteed cheap deploy at the right system. Wedge in ship and Hobbie in ship don&#146;t hurt much either, but capitals will. Are you seeing my pattern? You cannot use capitals in this deck because of your minimal activation and many other reasons, making Reds/Golds the best choice. You will only need two Yavin 4 sites to flip the objective, with Massassi Ruins, Jungle, and Massassi War Room being just about the only sites available. The opponent&#146;s deploy is +2 to your sites, and he cannot deploy anywhere, except the Docking Bay (not counting spies). This will be the site you will need to reinforce, if any. Once everything&#146;s on schedule and you have flipped your objective, it&#146;s time to have fun. Destroying the Death Star is no easy task, and you must be prepared. What I mean by prepared is having the Trench, Attack Run, Protorps, Rebel Techs, and some Attack Run-total-adding interrupts. This side is very beneficial, and any smart DS player will attempt to prevent your flip. This is no easy task, but it can be made easier if you&#146;re well defended. Now, I&#146;ll discuss the different types of MBO.<br>
<br>
     The first type is the regular flip-type. You concentrate on flipping, blowing away D*, and so on and so forth. This is much easier said than done, and flipping will take good defenses, a clueless opponent more or less, and some strong mains. This is where the deck has problems. You must spread on ground at the beginning, then spread in space near the end. If it can be done, well, it&#146;s One In A Million. Some good cards/strategies to help you accomplish this are: Rebel Barrier, Red Squadron X-wing, Yavin Sentries with that leader guy out, Obi-Wan With Lightsaber (protection for the DB), Rendezvous Point and Yoda&#146;s Hut (activation), all the weapon-related interrupts, Advance Preparation, You&#146;re All Clear Kid!, Y4: Briefing Room, Mon Mothma, Yavin 4 Troopers, and Blast The Door, Kid!. The problems with this decktype are enormous. The objective is good, yes, but it has lots of difficulty flipping against an experienced opponent. Anybody knows the trouble this objective has if you can&#146;t clean that one hit squad out of the DB. Also, you cannot devote many cards to different strategies, because the large portion of your deck is devoted to the large tasks of controlling three Yavin 4 sites, getting out matching pilot/starships at systems, blowing up the Death Star, and draining in space. This is so card intensive it isn&#146;t even funny. That&#146;s all for this decktype.<br>
<br>
     Another decent way of playing MBO is the flip with drains variant. This objective plays much like any other MBO, except it doesn&#146;t waste the card slots on blowing up the Death Star. Not many people bother blowing up the Bunker in a RST deck, so I think this analogy fits in quite nicely. You just can&#146;t do all of the things at once. I&#146;ve never seen a deck that focuses on sending a detachment to Tatooine, setting up a Jawa camp in Jabba&#146;s Palace, then blowing away Dagobah, then hunting down Luke and Obi, then freezing Han. It&#146;s just way to card intensive. In your beginning hand, you&#146;ll likely have a couple guys, a couple useless interrupts, a starship or two, and some other stuff that&#146;s only useful at a certain time. Getting back to the point, this decktype is card intensive, but less so than the previously mentioned style. Flipping the objective in this case is for the sole purpose of gaining the +3 in battles. The +2 in drains applies only if you&#146;ve blown away D*. Going through all the trouble of keeping Yavin 4 safe just to gain +3 in battles is pretty sad. MBO is better played for blowing away D*, but in a way, it&#146;s much harder to do. You gain more benefits but you also waste a lot of deck space. If you insist, I&#146;ll give you the pros and cons of this MBO. On the plus side, you&#146;re gaining that small edge in battles and you have a strong activation when flipped. On the other hand, you&#146;re going through all of this trouble just to gain +3 in space battles, and leaving yourself spread out on ground. Not exactly very card efficient, but it still does something.<br>
<br>
     My third, and last variant of MBO that I&#146;ll post (there&#146;s not much to work with, this deck plays like a machine, it&#146;s useless on the 0 side) is a little different, but nonetheless devastating against an unwary opponent. Remember earlier I told you MBO&#146;s biggest weakness was the opponent leaving a dogpile at a site? Well, this time I&#146;ll make an exception; you WANT the opponent to come down. This version plays troopers in an effective manner (if any) and is much like any other trooper deck. The 0 side provides you with a small choke on the opponent&#146;s deploy to Yavin 4, and gives you the Docking Bay, a great site for your troopers to run around and transit. Mon Mothma fits in nicely (you can pull the War Room from reserve, her from Strike Planning), docking bays from Insurrection, and you also give the opponent a small lure that may make him believe you&#146;re playing flip. This deck plays almost no space, and plays troopers heavily. Rebel Ambush works at Hoth and Yavin Docking Bays best, and Mon Mothma and Rapid Deployment can get out your troopers lightning fast. Which troopers work best for this deck? I would say Rebel Guards, but they&#146;re not troopers ;(. Your best bet here would be a mix of Y4 Troopers and Rebel Troopers. The Recruits are always good, and some Squad Leaders make movement more efficient. This deck is a real surprise to an unwary opponent and is very similar in playstyle to the IO/IC trooper deck I mentioned in my last article. The pros to this deck are few, but somewhat better than the previously mentioned decktypes. It has a big surprise factor, protects your start (+2 to his deploy), and can mass up power quickly. The bad part about this deck is its efficiency and narrowness. If the opponent is playing a more non-interactive deck, or MKoS swarms, you could be in big trouble. Regular power four Abyssins can easily outpower pumped up power three Rebel Troopers. If only they made a Captain Antilles! Anyways, I think that&#146;s all for MBO, it&#146;s not a very flexible objective and gets a 3 out of 5 stars from me. Why? If you can get it to work by blowing away the D*, you can easily line yourself up for the win. Also, it&#146;s a very unpredictable deck (people know how to beat it but they don&#146;t play it often and never meta against it), and it can be used very effectively in the hands of a really good player. It loses 2 stars because it is a weak objective, it&#146;s not flexible at all, and it&#146;s very card intensive. Also, it&#146;s difficult to play right and you must know your deck and his deck very well in order to play right. This deck can do very well against a SYCFA deck, however, and that is a very popular deck nowadays. That just gives a passing mark of 3.<br>
<br>
     Part two: Set Your Course For Alderaan/The Ultimate Power In The Universe: <br>
<br>
     0: Deploy Death Star and Alderaan systems and Docking Bay 327.<br>
     FOR remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth, or a Subjugated planet.<br>
     WHILE this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take one card with &quot;Death Star&quot; in title into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may not Force drain at Alderaan system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled.<br>
     FLIP this card if Alderaan is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
     7: WHILE this side up, one during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 if Victory-class) to Death Star system. Your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +1 (or +2 if that Star Destroyer is Imperial- or Super-class). If Yavin 4 system is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to force lost for each opponent&#146;s Yavin 4 site. <br>
     PLACE out of play if Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
     Hmmm, good activation right off the bat plus the ability to pull Death Star-related cards and deploy systems from reserve (when flipped), combined with the +2 to drains where you have Executor or another ISD makes this a very powerful objective card when used to flip. This objective, however, has been used to spawn many different subtypes, such as the Brangus Glee Superstar by Bastian Winkelhaus (much credit here and everywhere else), Prodigy, and the good old manipulator. Because of the strong activation early on, many players don&#146;t worry about trying to flip. Flipping is quite card intensive, but can be pulled off relatively easily, especially when compared to MBO. Unlike other &quot;base&quot;-type decks, SYCFA is your base, already set up. All you have to do is decorate the christmas tree with Death Star Gunners, Conference Room, etc. When flipped, you are given a large bonus for your ISDs and perhaps this makes them effective (still haven&#146;t decided, TIEs are efficiency at its finest). Nevertheless, ISDs are given a great boost by this objective. The difficulty is pulling CPI, because none of your characters can search for it and it is absolutely essential to flipping the objective. I&#146;ll discuss more into detail the many, many, many, types of SYCFA that currently exist. I&#146;m sorry to disappoint all of you SYCFA fanatics out there, but not much new will be revealed, just different ways to play this wonderful objective. I don&#146;t know everything about SYCFA decks, but I do know enough to be able to describe to you the many different subtypes. Here goes.<br>
<br>
     The first example I will conjure up for you is the flip version. Playing this objective to flip is, once again, beneficial in many ways, but only for your Star Destroyers. Thus you will want to concentrate the large percentage of your deck to ISDs and pilots (ISDs cannot work well without them). To flip, you need the bare essentials i.e. Death Star Gunners, a few copies of CPI, Superlaser, Death Star: Conference Room, and a few D* sites. That part isn&#146;t too difficult, and flipping doesn&#146;t hurt the opponent much, but can later on. After you have flipped, you can go wild and drain with ISDs all across your battleground systems. Good cards to include are: Devastator, Executor, DS-61 squad, Captain Godherdt, Admiral Piett, Admiral Ozzel, Admiral Chiraneau, Kashyyyk, Sullust, Mon Calamari, Tatooine, Kessel, Something Special Planned For Them, Lateral Damage, and A Day Long Remembered (only if you plan on continuing your D* rampage). The weakness with this deck lies in the nature of Star Destroyers. These starships are, well, not the most efficient starships in the game, even with their bonuses given by TUPITU. Generally, don&#146;t try weapons in this type of deck, because your destiny will be low as it is with all your necessary ISDs and pilots. Also, a heavy ground drain deck will give you trouble, and heavy space decks may also give you a lot of trouble, surprisingly. Also, many light side decks have powerful starships that wreck ISDs. They are just too high of a deploy and are lacking in the game text. True, I have seen many great SYCFA flip decks, but I have always prefered non-flip. More on that now.<br>
<br>
     Another fine SYCFA that I am currently playing, with much success, is the manipulator variant. What this deck does is deny the opponent and manipulate him to your advantage. Great manipulator cards include M&#146;iiyoom Onith (put her somewhere safe aboard the D* and scan away), A Dangerous Time (as always in manipulator decks), Monnok (so many people play doubles that this card is more and more essential to manipulators), Sense and Alter (they&#146;re Sense and Alter! Cancel Shocking Information, Goo Nee Tay, and anything else you want. Personally I think DODN/WA isn&#146;t very hurtful if you&#146;re desperate to cancel such and such an interrupt/effect), and Ability x3. My SYCFA manip is currently undefeated and works great against mains, while Monnok kills off doubles, which everyone else will play. Basically this deck plays non-flip and uses the extra force to use the costly Monnok and M&#146;iiyoom. The downside of this deck is Goo Nee Tay (which may be Altered) and Yarna D&#146;al Gargan (which all AitC decks should use, btw) and any time that you can&#146;t get M&#146;iiyoom out. Even worse is Boushh coming down, breaking cover, then whooping M&#146;iiyoom (which is why I use Ephant), because M&#146;iiyoom only targets *unique males. Leia isn&#146;t much of a threat to this deck if you&#146;re well prepared. I personally love playing this deck and it&#146;s very fun.<br>
<br>
     TIE SYCFA seems to be one of the more popular decks out there right now, primarily because of the strong coherence between many of the key cards. Mobilization Points allows you mass activation at DB 327 and lets you pull Wakeelmui. Your TIEs come down real cheap and easy with such big activation in a deck, especially if you have Kuat and Wakeelmui (that&#146;s how it&#146;s spelled, I&#146;m 100% sure it&#146;s not Wakelmiu or Walkemumu or something else) out. TIEs have always been good cards (well, kinda, Interceptors were a great addition to the armada) and have been boosted by cards such as: Dark Maneuvers &amp; Tallon Roll (you can&#146;t play TIEs without this!), Short-Range Fighters, All Power To Weapons, Pride Of The Empire, Sienar Fleet Systems (not Sinear), The Emperor&#146;s Shield/Sword, and Dreaded Imperial Starfleet. This deck is very efficient, can mass up big power, and has lots of room for extra stuff. Generally, you won&#146;t want to flip the objective and you will be always on the offensive. There are so many great TIE-related cards out there that I won&#146;t mention (look &#146;em up yourselves), but I will give away the pros and cons. Most of the pros you already know, and you shouldn&#146;t have any problem identifying with me. The cons are often underestimated and never usually adapted to. Most people don&#146;t understand that TIEs don&#146;t have hyperspeed (with the exception of Scouts and Vader&#146;s Custom TIE, but only cheese players will understand why these TIEs rock)! They require Dreadnaughts and ISDs to carry them around, and this makes it very difficult to spread around with TIEs. Also, TIEs work best in numbers, and the opponent will likely spread and outdrain you. You cannot do this because of the limitations in hyperspeed, but you can still cause damage. Also, the opponent controlling Wakeelmui can really cringe your deployment, even with all that activation. This is still an efficient decktype however, and should be tried out before you play ISDs. <br>
<br>
     One of the later additions to SYCFA subtypes is the Brangus Glee Superstar deck. This deck was discovered by Bastian &quot;Death Star&quot; Winkelhaus, or so I was led to believe, and has proved to be very difficult to beat. You know how to beat it? I don&#146;t doubt it, but many players don&#146;t, which is one of the main factors in its success. It plays non-flip, and uses a fairly efficient (not the best, though) retrieval engine. If you would like to learn how the Brangus Glee/D*:DB 327/PASOA engine works, check out Brangus Glee Superstar on DeckTech. This decktype is quite popular, and there have been many different modifications and changes made by different players, which leads us to...<br>
<br>
     Prodigy is one of the newer decktypes out there, and is basically a mix between Brangus Glee Superstar and a Court deck. It uses Scum &amp; Villainy and Brangus engine to retrieve everything. It works wonders in the ways of retrieval, and many LS players don&#146;t see it coming from a dark deck. I have never played either of these decks, so unfortunately I cannot offer advice on deckbuilding or strategies for/against this decktype. If you would like to learn more, check out Prodigy and Brangus Glee Superstar and tell me it doesn&#146;t rock. These decks look really wierd at first, but it is rumored that they bend the game into a totally new dimension. Errata? Nah, they (Decipher) wouldn&#146;t dare. This deck is great and plays quite fairly, if you know what I mean. It isn&#146;t complete cheese, it&#146;s a little cheesy, but it still plays in its own way. <br>
<br>
     That&#146;s all for these objectives, and I&#146;ll conclude SYCFA with a rating. I give it 5 out of 5 stars because of its amazing flexibility, which has been tested and proven. It is also not half bad on its own, or so to say going for flip. I rate it best (but not perfect; no objective&#146;s perfect IMHO) because it provides a very strong early game activation and it allows you to pull Docking Control Room 327 for even more mad activation! This underrated card can pull out every docking bay that exists, whenever, for free, as many times as you wish. I would die if D errata&#146;ed this card, you can activate like twenty force on your second turn! Mob Points make this strategy so broken it reeks of cheese. I love SYCFA and so do many other people. If Decipher made objectives so that people could play creatively, competitively, this card is the perfect personification of that wish. Little did Decipher know that this card would be the biggest sleeper objective in a long time. I can foresee people coming up with even more ingenious ways to play this great card. In conclusion, I would like to give credit to everyone who rated and gave comments, I appreciate them a lot. I know this is a loooong read, but it&#146;s almost finished. If you have any advice or comments on my article series, feel free to drop me a D-mail. I haven&#146;t mentioned every single possible type of MBO and SYCFA, but I hope I have given you an outline to open your minds to the many possibilities (well, mostly SYCFA) of these two objectives. Next article I will write will be all about the two objectives from the Enhanced Jabba&#146;s Palace Pack. These two objectives have been shooed away at first, until players have realized the potency of bringing back old cards and using them creatively. One of these objectives is severely hurt by Reflections II but is STILL TOURNAMENT VIABLE. Ok, I&#146;ll give it away here. Profit is NOT dead because of CCT, it is just more at risk than ever before. It is still a great decktype and now has a true bane, which not everybody in the whole wide world plays. The other objective card is CotVG. This card has always been good, and has greatly boosted aliens in a way that nobody expected. Being able to draw multiple destinies, retrieve two force for battle (considering you&#146;re using Scum And Villainy), make this objective very powerful. Keep checking articles for these interesting articles about objectives.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2178"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2178"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2178" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
