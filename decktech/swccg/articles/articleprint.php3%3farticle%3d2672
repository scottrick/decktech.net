Unfortunately, grabbing all the cards required was incredibly difficult and the fact that your deck was screwed if your opponent did not play with a Death Star in their deck, as there was no Light Side Death Star. As a result this deck type saw little, if any, play. Later on Decipher saw that it was time to help out this failed mechanic. When Special Edition was released they decided to print a Light Side Disco Ball. However, this still wasn&#146;t enough. In Third Anthology they created an objective for this crumbling deck. Great benefits on the flip side if you chose not to blow the D* away, but even more benefits if you did. This benefits included power plus three and drains plus two. This objective also makes blowing up the giant floating disco ball much easier by allowing you to pull all required components, except of course the pilots and their ships. Big D cured this problem by including the card Squadron Assignments in Death Star II. This card wasn&#146;t only for MBO, but it did help it greatly. Decipher saw that even these two great cards weren&#146;t enough to encourage players to use this deck type. In Tatooine Decipher included a &#146;helper&#146; or &#146;fixer&#146; card for this objective. Great Shot, Kid! included even more benefits if you blew away the Death Star, however, like its counterpart, A Million Voices Crying Out (please read article on my page) nothing to help you blow the great floating ball out of the sky. But, I think, that we got enough. The ability to deploy starships from your reserve for free and retrieving three force each time you did so is quite enough. On to the objective!<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin4: Docking Bay.] {For} remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors. {While} this side up, you generate no more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4.  {Flip} this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls fewer than three Yavin 4 sites. {Place} out of play if Yavin 4 is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Your total power is +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponent&#146;s Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force Drains at battleground systems where you have a star fighter with a pilot character aboard are each +2. <br>
<br>
		Fixer Effect Text<br>
<br>
Deploy on table. If Death Star &quot;blown away&quot;: once during each of your turns you may deploy (for free) a starship from hand or Reserve Deck and reshuffle. If you just deployed a unique (*) starship to a system location, retrieve 3 Force. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
	The front side of this objective doesn&#146;t give you too many advantages, in fact it might be considered a Disadvantage. Only activating one force per location is huge in a game when you&#146;ll need all the force you can get. This objective does give your opponent two force, so you could be seeing a first turn Vader with Hunt Down, of course at a different planet. Also, you can&#146;t play Revolution or force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors, but these should hurt you too much. Other than that there are no other disadvantages. Flipping is pretty easy, only having to control three sites. However, it will be pretty easy for your opponent to stop you by controlling or occupying three sites.<br>
<br>
<br>
	There are also many advantages to offset the apparent disadvantages. All imperials are deploy plus two to Yavin 4 for the remainder of the game. That should help you keep those nasty imperials away from Yavin for the time being.  Also, on the back of the card you&#146;ll notice that there is no place out of play or flip, so once its flipped, it stays flipped. Also on the back of the card is a text very similar to Echo Base Operations, which is very beneficial. As a compliment to all these nice bonuses there is also a line that lets you pull everything you need to blow up the Death Star. Another huge advantage is being able to drop the D* without completing Death Star Plans.<br>
<br>
	As stated previously, the way to flip your objective is to control three Yavin sites, while your opponent controls or occupies less than three. The best way to accomplish this is to make three more sites so you can still flip if your opponent is camped out on the other two.  I believe that the three best are the War Room, the Jungle, and the Ruins. I would Not play the HQ because the effects of your opponent even occupying can be disastrous. Also you&#146;ll need to throw in some twixes to help you out in the activation department. Yoda&#146;s Hut and Rendezvous Point come to mind.  The best way to flip, in my opinion, is to have your 2/2 pilots (good for flip side), Rogue Speeders (power), and Insurrection (to boost immunity). IncomCorp is Definitely a good addition to further boost immunity. Another way to flip easily is to use Strike Planning to grab Crix and use him to play the ground like an RST deck. You could even go for the Arconas. Some other good cards would be Grondon Muse and Yavin Sentry. While you&#146;re using Grondon you get all the bonuses from Yavin Sentry. Lost in the Wilderness could also be beneficial. Your EPP Hit Squad should also be thrown in in case your opponent is playing ground and leaves an open, or weak location.<br>
<br>
Deploy on Death Star: Trench. During your move phase, you may make an Attack Run as follows: {Enter Trench:} Move up to 3 of your star fighters into trench (for free). Dark Side may immediately follow with up to 3 TIEs (for free). {Provide Cover:} Identify your lead star fighter (Proton Torpedoes* required) and wingmen (if any). Turbo Laser Batteries and TIEs with weapons may now target your star fighters (wingmen first, then lead if no wingmen remaining). Hit star fighters are immediately lost. {It&#146;s Away!:} Draw two destiny. {Pull Up!:} All star fighters now move to Death Star system (for free). If (total destiny+X+Y-Z) &gt; 15, Death Star is &quot;blown away.&quot; X=ability of lead pilot or 3 if Targeting Computer is present. Y=total sites at largest Rebel Base (Yavin 4 or Hoth). Z=highest ability of TIE pilots present. *Your proton torpedoes are immune to overload. <br>
<br>
	After the flip blowing away the D* is a main part of the game. There are many cards that add to your Attack Run Total. Here are some that I&#146;ve found (thanks Deckmaker!):<br>
<br>
	Colonel Feyn Gospic; When at Massassi War Room,    doubles Rebel Tech bonus to Attack Run.<br>
	Major Palo Torshan; While at your war room, adds 1 to your Attack Run total.<br>
	Old Times; If Luke and Biggs are making an Attack Run, add one destiny to your Attack Run total.	Rebel Tech; When at one of your war rooms: {Cumulatively} adds 1 to total of Attack Run. (Or 		During your control phase, may send this tech to your Used Pile, search your Reserve 		Deck and take Death Star: Trench into hand. Shuffle, cut and replace.)<br>
	Tiree; On Gold 2, also adds 1 to maneuver and (when in Death Star: Trench) adds 1 to total of 		Attack Run.<br>
	 Yavin 4: Briefing Room; If you control, with a leader here, may add 1 to total of Attack Run.<br>
	Yavin 4: Massassi Headquarters; If you control, Attack Run total is +2.<br>
	You&#146;re All Clear Kid!; Add 1 to total of Attack Run if lead star fighter has matching pilot aboard.<br>
<br>
	Most of these, however, are a waste of space. I would probably go for Colonel Feyn and some Techs, 4 or so.  We&#146;ll run through a hypothetical Attack Run now, okay? Let&#146;s say you have Luke in Artoo In Red 5.  For this example we&#146;ll use Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. Let&#146;s also pretend you have four Yavin sites and three Techs at the War Room with Feyn Gospic leading them all. Your opponent is playing MKOS and has no TIEs. Here&#146;s the formula:<br>
	D +(6+5+6-0&gt;15) where D= two destiny draws. You need to draw a 0 with two destiny draws to 						   blow it up. Heh, that&#146;s pretty easy.<br>
<br>
	What I recommend is that you pull all of the stuff you need and keep it in hand and deploy it all in one big group when you&#146;re ready to blow (Oh, and not little boys T.J.) Also I recommend the card Fly Casual (Endor) so you can drop all your guys directly to the D*. I have compiled a list of all the things you need to blow it up.<br>
<br>
	 The Objective<br>
 	Yavin 4<br>
 	Yavin: Docking Bay<br>
 	Yavin sites x3<br>
 	Death Star (LS)<br>
 	Death Star: Trench<br>
 	Proton Torpedoes<br>
	Attack Run<br>
	Rebel Techs x3-4<br>
 	Star Fighter<br>
 	Pilot <br>
<br>
	Now is the part where that new effect really works its magic. You should be able to get huge power (+3) and huge drains (+2) to go along with that awesome retrieval engine. Remember, the +2 to drains is only applicable if you have a star fighter with a pilot. I like to throw in those great unique MonCals from DSII to take advantage of the deploy for free and cover places like Kiffex, Coruscant, and Kessel and drain for 4, 5, and 5 (respectively) and your star fighters from the Attack Run.  You should spread out like this and continue draining the life out of your opponent. The fourteen force loss from blowing the death Star will be a major blow and your retrevial and drains should finish him off.  So to sum it up what Decipher has done with this objective is make it like the Train to 5 decks of old. If you can survive the process you&#146;ll reap the rewards. <br>
<br>
	Here are some prime examples of MBO at work:<br>

Post Script: If some of the spacing is off, please don&#146;t hurt me. It was looking a-okay in WordPad, but once it got into Decktech&#146;s word processor it screwed up, so I don&#146;t know if it will return to normal.<br>

Post Post Script: If there are any tags, it ain&#146;t my fault. They were not there in Decktech&#146;s word processor so it&#146;s all good...<br>
