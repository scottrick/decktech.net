	Once upon a time, everyone was playing with Controls.  You'd see them in Sense / Alter decks, you'd see them in There Is No Try decks.  You'd see them, and usually in multiples, in basically every deck.  It was one of the few cards you could never get enough of.<br>
	Now things have changed.  People don't seem as worried about getting their red cards sensed/altered, due to the ability to start with strategies that hinder (notice i don't say stop) Sense / Alter; objectives such as Mind What You Have Learned / Hunt Down and effects like There Is No Try / Do or Do Not and Oppresive Enforcement / Wise Advice.  Therefore the trend I've noticed lately is that controls are getting squeezed out of decks in favor of other things, even decks that splash Sense / Alter.  However, Control is just as powerful now, if not more, than in it's heyday.<br>
	First of all, despite all these effects and objectives mentioned, Control is the only way to actually STOP a sense or alter, no way of getting around it.  None of the others guarantees a stop, they just make it harder, or make the opponent pay.  This is the key, because an opponent who is trying to Sense / Alter, really only needs to get a couple of critical cancels a game to seriously disrupt your game plan, whether he sends them back to the used pile or loses two force.  If you are playing Sense / Alter and come up against someone who is doing the same, Control is the card that will give you the edge, because you can break the Sense / Alter chain.  In this capacity, control can save you a lot of cards, in the Sense / Alter 'wars'.  Therefore, it is useful in Sense / Alter splash decks as well.<br>
	Another very powerful use of Control is to cancel a Force Drain (note that this is not immune to sense!).  Reversing a trend from Jabba's Palace, players are once again trying to 'max out' their force drains at just a few locations.  Jabba's Palace's Resistance and Ultimatum had kind of steered players to spreading out with multiple drains, as anything over 2 was impossible with those effects.  However, Special Edition's drains -1 objectives, and now Endor's Battle Plan / Battle Order, combined with a drop in use of Resis&amp;Ultim, have got people wanting to get as high as possible again so that they can force drains over the -1's and not have to pay too much if things Battle Plan/Order goes against them.  Therefore, a few Controls can save you quite a bit of force.  I've always felt it was the premiere card in a 'force drain war' deck, where bascially you say, 'The opponent can drain for whatever he wants, and I'll drain for whatever I want, we'll never interact and I'll win'. In a recent qualifier, I Controlled 3 drain 3 from reserve deck, allowing me time to build up an overpowering force without premature deployment.  Nearly all decks will have a drain for more than one at least a few times a game, and Control will give you the card advantage.<br>
	Finally, there are a just a couple of nasty immediate and mobile effects that can't be stopped any other way than through Control.  Also, with fewer people playing Control, your opponent is often assuming he will get his effect through, making it tripled effectiveness, especially since you can cancel it in any phase.  Here is a list of the ones I can think of<br>
	Descent into the Dark<br>
	Ice Storm<br>
	Imperial Atrocity / Imperial Progaganda<br>
	Sandwhirl<br>
Controlling and Imperial Atrocity or Sandwhirl can DEFINITELY be worth it!<br>
	So for its versatility alone as well as its power, Control is still a premo card.  It can be used to stop a couple of key effects, as well as two of the most powerful aspects of the game, Sense / Alter and Force Drains.  It's one of those cards you can never go wrong with in a deck.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
