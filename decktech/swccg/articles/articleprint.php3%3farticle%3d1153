<br>
Basic Definition of a Gunner:<br>
A Gunner is any character card that adds or enhances a weapon destiny draw.<br>
<br>
Reasons for Change:<br>
<br>
	How many times have we seen in one of the movies where in a dogfight or pursuit the fighter on the defensive successfully avoids be blow into atoms only to have the maneuver that saved him cause him to crash into something else or fly into another ships weapons shot.  To me this is what attrition is all about those unknowns that can cause problems during a battle.	I understand the reasoning behind passengers not applying their ability to draw destiny, but I also understand that they are not having any affect on the battle.  This makes gunners unique in that they are the only passengers that have ability that can affect a battle.  Droids affect battles in some case but, as they do not have ability this does not apply.  Attrition is based on ability, as I understand it, because of ones ability to use the force to anticipate and react to the changing situation.  For any one who has read the X-Wing series of books there are many times when someone will fire a weapon to get a result which will give them an advantage even though they did not hit the opponent.<br>
<br>
	I think the adoption of this rule could have an impact on the game and encourage the use of cards that are often left out of decks.  The most prominent of these are vehicle and starship weapons.  There are also a multitude of related interrupts that seem to be considered useless because players are not using weapons.<br>
<br>
	The overall impact of this change could be very minor however unless it is tried we will never know.  There are very few cards that have gunner in the lore or game text and most, if not all, all ability 2 or less.  This may seem an insignificant difference in most battles. However, the introduction of cards like Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and other cards that increase the ability required to draw Battle Destiny or reduce destiny if ability is less than X, would become less powerful against decks that use more unconventional card combinations.<br>
<br>
Reasons against this change:<br>
<br>
	I personally have only been able to come up with 2 arguments against and only one of them is a reasonable argument.<br>
<br>
	The first is 'This is how it has been for 5 years we do not need to change the rules now' other wise known as the 'If it is not broke do not fix it'.  I do not believe that this is a reasonable argument.  Rules are ever changing, some to keep the playing field level to correct problems that no one could have predicted would occur.  The original rules have not changed much but the interpretation of them has.	When the Game was first introduced there were, to my knowledge, no gunners.  The first gunner that I can re-call is Danz Borin, which was part of 'A New Hope' expansion. I am excluding Death Star Gunners as they only affect the 'Commence Primary Ignition'.<br>
<br>
	The second is 'Is going to affect the game enough to justify changing the rules.'  Many people that I have discussed this with do not think that this change would have a significant impact on the game.  While it might not have the drastic effect of some rule changes, I do not believe it will hurt the game.  So much of the fun of this game is building your deck and seeing how it will do against other peoples. As the game gets an ever-increasing amount of cards that are available, more deck types will appear.  This is change could spark more interest in decks that normally would not have been built because they are consider weak.<br>
<br>
	Some may ask why I am writing this and that is a good question.  Partly to make people think, partly to give the game a nudge in a little different direction and partly out my frustration with some of the newer cards.  I had at least 4 battles where I would have been able to draw destiny or kept it from being dropped to zero if I could have counted on using my gunners ability to draw battle destiny.  This mostly comes about when facing Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.  I love playing this game and building decks and just really tired of seeing the same old decks every time I go to a tournament.<br>
