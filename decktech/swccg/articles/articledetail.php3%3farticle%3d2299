This article will analyze the card as well as give different techniques for it<br>
<br>
[Deploy Holotheatre and Visage Of The Emperor. May deploy Meditation Chamber and/or Epic Duel.] <br>
Optional starting generation of 4 (which I recommend), with a docking bay that can be pulled by IAO, not a bad start.  You also must deploy Visage of the Emperor, which is a liability on this side, since you are losing 1 per turn as well as your opponent.  You can also pull Epic Duel, which is a big part of one variant of this deck, but it is a matter of taste.<br>
<br>
{While} this side up, during your move phase, may use 4 Force to take Vader into hand from a location you control (cards on him go to owner&#146;s Used Pile). Add 4 to each player&#146;s destiny draw for Sense and Alter.  <br>
Pulling Vader back to hand can&#146;t be overlooked, since you can use it to cancel Uncontrollable Fury if you aren&#146;t playing Lord Vader, but it is an expensive way to do it.  You can also get him out of a no-win situation, if he is alone.  Also adds 4 to each Sense and Alter draw, making it harder to cancel effects, but only when this side is up.<br>
<br>
{Flip} this card if Vader is at a battleground site and no Light Jedi or Luke is at a battleground site.  {Place} out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site.<br>
Tough flipping plan because of the fact that Luke, a key part of most every deck, as well as Obi or Yoda, both of whom have their uses in certain decks, can&#146;t be at a battleground site and Vader must be at one (Note: Executor sites aren&#146;t typically battlegrounds).  Placing out of play is easy to avoid. Just don&#146;t pack Scanning Crew and put Epic Duel out at the beginning if you plan to use it.  Executor sites are not worth draining at anyway.<br>
<br>
Here is the back:<br>
{While} this side up, opponent cannot initiate battles or Force drains where opponent has a Jedi or Skywalker. You lose no Force from Visage Of The Emperor. While Vader at Meditation Chamber, subtract 2 from each of opponent&#146;s battle destiny draws. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter.  <br>
Keeps your opponent from using Jedi, Luke, or Leia in battles of their own choosing, taking out part of Super Falcon.  Also lets you ignore Visage&#146;s effect on you and gives a bonus for keeping Vader at home, so to speak.<br>
<br>
{Flip} this card if opponent has Luke or a Jedi at a battleground site or if Vader is not on table.  {Place} out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site.<br>
A little easier to keep flipped, since Vader doesn&#146;t have to be at a battleground.  Out of play requirements are the same.<br>
<br>
Here is the game text of the objective&#146;s starting cards:<br>
<br>
Executor: Holotheater (Dagobah rare)<br>
LS: (No icons)  If you control, Force drain +1 here.<br>
DS: (1 icon) If you have Vader or Emperor on table, your Force generation is +1 here (+2 if both).<br>
The LS text isn&#146;t all that important if you try to keep them out of the Executor altogether.  The Dark Side text can help boost your generation, though, as long as you have Vader or the Emperor on the table.  The advantage of this is that they don&#146;t have to be at the location for the benefit to occur.<br>
<br>
Visage of the Emperor (Dagobah rare)<br>
Lose 2 Force to deploy on Executor: Holotheatre or Death Star: Conference Room. At the end of each player&#146;s turn, each player must lost 1 Force. Effect canceled if opponent controls this site. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
You can ignore the lose 2 Force part, since it is being deployed for something else.  The net effect is that Between the end of a player&#146;s turn, and the beginning of his or her next turn, he or she loses two force.  This can be cancelled if your opponent controls the site or by a Transmission Terminated.  A common site control technique is to drop an auto-undercover spy to the Holotheater, then break its cover.  Usually Boushh or TK-422 is used for this.  There isn&#146;t much you can do for this, except to keep a character there to stop it.  This card isn&#146;t essential for a well-made Hunt Down deck to work right, but it is like a perpetual two drain for each player, at least when the objective is on the 0 side.  Some people pack multiples of it, but I don&#146;t see the point, myself.<br>
<br>
Executor:  Meditation Chamber (Dagobah rare)<br>
LS: (no icon) If you occupy, opponent&#146;s Meditation Chamber game text is canceled.<br>
DS: (2 icons) If Vader alone here, once per turn, may apply his ability to draw battle destiny at any system.<br>
A good generation site, and a good place to try and keep your opponent away from.  This location&#146;s only real drawback is that it isn&#146;t a battleground for flipping Hunt Down<br>
<br>
Epic Duel (Cloud City rare/ Reflections foil)<br>
Deploy on your side of table. The Circle Is Now Complete or Vader&#146;s Obsession may be played to initiate an epic duel as follows: If Vader is present with specified target, each player draws two destiny (add 1 to each destiny draw if using a lightsaber). Add character&#146;s ability. If {Vader} loses, place him out of play. You lose 6 Force (9 if dueling Luke). If {Obi-Wan} loses, place him out of play. Opponent loses 9 Force. If {Luke} loses, opponent must choose: Cross Luke to the Dark Side and lose X Force, Where X = Luke&#146;s ability. OR Lose Luke and lose triple X Force.<br>
<br>
There are three options with this deck.  First, you can put Obi-Wan out of play, which is useful, or you can turn or kill a Luke.  This requires a few cards to pull off, plus good tracking.  The Circle is used to duel Obi.  Vader&#146;s Obsession is used against Luke and may be used by Darth or Mara, which is good in case your opponent gets the better of you, you can still use the card.  It also can&#146;t be cancelled.<br>
<br>
A good counter to the Luke dueling aspect of this card, at least against Vader is using the combo of Anakin Skywalker and I Feel the Conflict.  In this scenario, if Luke loses the duel, the Light Side Player will chose to lose Luke, but then slap down Anakin.  They can use the cards stacked on Conflict, from winning battles, to add three each to their draw.  If they draw a total &gt; 12, (&gt; 6 if Emperor is present) Luke isn&#146;t lost, Vader is on their side, and the Emperor is lost if at that location.  This seems to be fairly rarely used, fortunately.<br>
<br>
Deck Themes:<br>
There are two basic types of themes for this objective:<br>
Dueling: Uses several manipulation cards, and requires good tracking, because Vader or Mara is placed out of play if they lose a duel.<br>
Non-dueling:  Relies more on battling and draining to win the game.<br>
<br>
Subtypes are many and varied, but here is a rundown of some of them as well as some counters to them.<br>
Flagship Operations:  Uses Hunt Down to get a jump on the number of Executor locations required to get Flagship Operations out.  Almost always non-dueling and focused on space.  <br>
	Counters:  Starship weapons will help in this.  You should focus on taking out the ship that the effect is on.  If it is on the Executor, a pair of high tracked destinies with a Heavy Turbolaser Battery or multiple weapons with Combined Attack (a common Premiere lost interrupt).<br>
Royal Guards:  As the name implies, you will be using royal guards and their weapons.  This is common in dueling and non-dueling varieties and is fairly evenly split between ground and space.<br>
	Counters:  You should try to spread out the guards and overpower them individually or in small groups, but avoid facing a large group all at once.  EPP beatdowns are helpful here, as are generals with Rebel Leadership to keep your opponent from drawing multiple destinies.  Take out the Emperor if you can and control any Coruscant locations that are out in numbers to make it difficult for your opponent to get guards out.<br>
Troopers:  Nearly the same as Royal Guards, but uses more characters and less weapons.  Usually more focused on ground.<br>
	Counters:  Trooper Assault is a commonly used interrupt for this kind of deck, so using a grabber card on it would be a good idea.<br>
Scum:  This relies on aliens with special abilities and especially bounty hunters to achieve results.  Focus varies from deck to deck.  You can do a capture variant of this if you want to.<br>
	Counters:  No Disintegrations (Dagobah rare) is an excellent counter to this, as your opponent loses force for each character you lose at the same location as a bounty hunter, and the bounty hunter while <br>
Vader is on the table.<br>
Odds:  This uses insert cards and other manipulation to hurt your opponent.  This can fit in as a side theme on any of the others.<br>
	Counters:  Ultimatum limits the effects of inserts that cause force loss if you occupy multiple battlegrounds.  Honor of the Jedi can also help on this, unless your opponent is playing No Escape.<br>
<br>
Card Selection:<br>
Characters:<br>
No matter what, you will want to include multiple copies of Vader in order to keep the objective flipped.  I recommend using Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith (Special Edition rare) or Lord Vader (Death Star 2 rare) in this role. <br>
Dueling:  You will also wish to include multiple copies of Mara in order to duel Luke.  She has two benefits in this role.  She is more disposable than Vader and also can&#146;t be caught by the Vader crossing combo I mentioned earlier.  For this to work, you will need to use the original Mara, and she gets a power boost from the Emperor being on the table, so you may want to include him.  Another trick you might want to try would be to include Grand Moff Tarkin, and have Darth initiate a duel during a battle, because then, you can use Tarkin&#146;s ability to cancel a draw during a battle to target one of your opponent&#146;s duel draws.<br>
Flagship Operations:  Admiral Piett (Death Star 2 fixed) and several other major pilots are useful in this deck.  If you plan on using the Super Chimaera combo, you have to include Grand Admiral Thrawn (Reflections 2) and Captain Gilad Pellaeon (Reflections 2).<br>
Royal Guards:  You will want multiple royal guards.  Myn Kyneugh (Death Star 2 rare) and the Emperor are important in this deck.  Kir Kanos (Reflections 2) is optional, but a risk, because of the continuous force use and loss to keep him on the table.<br>
Troopers:  Troopers and quite a few of them are necessary for this deck.  Which kind of trooper depends on your locations of choice.  If you are playing a lot of Hoth, use Snowtroopers, ect.  The best all around troopers for this are Navy Troopers or Stormtroopers.  You will also want to include several supporting characters for the trooper type you choose.  For example, a Snowtrooper deck will need Bursk and Narthax, while a Stormtrooper deck should have a few cadets and Renz.  All trooper decks should have General Tagge for his forfeit boost and a couple of Elite Squadron Stormtroopers.<br>
Scum:  You will want Jabba and a lot of bounty hunters and aliens in this deck.  Which personas of the various hunters and what aliens to use is your choice. <br>
Odds:  You will want to avoid low destiny characters, and stay away from mains as much as possible if you are using 3,720 to 1.<br>
<br>
Devices:<br>
Devices entirely depend on what kind of deck you are playing, and are not always necessary.<br>
Troopers:  You may want to use some Stormtrooper Utility Belts (Premiere common2), but that depends on personal play style and if you are using AELOMBS.<br>
Scum:  If you are playing a capture deck, you may want Binders (Cloud City common) or Interrogation Array (Cloud City rare).<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Effects to use depend entirely on what type of Hunt Down deck you are playing, but here are some ideas.<br>
 You are using Vader, so I Am Your Father (Cloud City rare) may be a good card to put in for its effect on Luke.<br>
If you are using docking bays, Imperial Arrest Order (Endor uncommon) and Mobilization Points (Death Star 2 common) are very useful.<br>
If you plan on battling a lot, include First Strike (Special Edition uncommon) as a source of retrieval.<br>
Anti-retrieval cards would be a good idea, and the best examples of this are Secret Plans (Special Edition uncommon) and Something Special Planned for Them (Death Star 2 common).<br>
As I stated before, some people include multiple copies of Visage of the Emperor, but this isn&#146;t necessary.<br>
Flagship Operations:  Flagship Operations (Death Star 2 rare) is important in this deck, and you should include multiple copies of it.  Sienar Fleet Systems (Special Edition rare) and Kuat Drive Yards (Special Edition rare) can also be important.   If you use unique starfighters, include Combat Response (Death Star 2 common).  Something Special Planned For Them (Death Star 2 common) is another good card to include.<br>
Royal Guards:  Use Inconsequential Losses (Death Star 2 common) in order to use your royal guards&#146; force pikes to satisfy attrition.<br>
Troopers:  An Entire Legion of my Best Troops (Endor uncommon) is probably the most useful effect for this deck, as it makes your troopers tougher (except biker scouts, who you will want to use Biker Scout Gear (Endor uncommon) for).  Strategic Reserves (Special Edition rare) is a good way to block drains.  If you plan on using weapons, you should include Imperial Academy Training (Endor common) also.  The rest depends on what locations you use and what kind of troopers you are using.  <br>
Scum:  Scum and Villainy (Jabba&#146;s Palace rare) in multiple is essential to this deck and helps on retrieval.  Jabba&#146;s Influence (Special Edition rare/ First Anthology premium) also is useful if your opponent is playing a deck with low-ability characters.  If you are using non-unique aliens, include Den of Theives (Jabba&#146;s Palace uncommon) to block drains.  A variety of Bounties, especially Hutt Bounty (Jabba&#146;s Palace rare) may be useful if you are capturing, as will be All Wrapped Up (Jabba&#146;s Palace uncommon).<br>
Odds:  The insert cards make up the bulk of the effects, but you will want some retrieval if possible.  3,720 to 1 (Dagobah common) is the best of the insert effects to use, because it is the only direct damage insert.  Knowledge and Defense (Dagobah common) is another good one to use, as it keeps your opponent from battling during a turn.  This works best as a side theme for Scum decks with bounties, as in that case, you will be retrieving a large amount of Force.  Extra Visages would work well as a form of manipulation in this deck.<br>
<br>
Interrupts:<br>
These also depend on your deck and personal preference, but here are some ideas.  In addition to these you will want a starting interrupt, but this choice is more about personal preference than anything else.  If you only have a few Vaders, you may want to use The Empire&#146;s Back (Premiere uncommon2), so you can pull him from the lost pile.<br>
Imbalance (Dagobah uncommon) is good anti-retrieval tech, as it makes your opponent lose half of what they just retrieved.<br>
Dueling:  You will want multiple copies of the duel-starting interrupts, I consider 3 a good number.  Focused attack is also a good card to use to increase your likelihood of winning a duel.  You Are Beaten (Cloud City uncommon) is a good multipurpose card to use also.<br>
Flagship Operations:  There are a lot of good interrupts for starships, but one that I particularly like is Overwhelmed (Special Edition commons).  Another good one is the Reflections 2 combo Dark Maneuvers &amp; Tallon Roll.<br>
Troopers:  You will need multiple copies of Trooper Assault (Cloud City common), and if you want to use it, Trooper Sabacc (Special Edition fixed) is also good.  Tactical Support (Hoth rare2), though expensive can also be a part of your deck.  If you plan on using lots of weapons, Don&#146;t Move (Endor common) and Freeze! (Endor uncommon) can help you prevent or lessen damage.<br>
Scum:  Abyssan Ornament &amp; Wounded Wookie (Reflections 2), as well as their single card counterparts can help get aliens out and hurt your opponent.  Jabba&#146;s Twerps (Special Edition uncommon) is also a good choice.  If you are playing with bounty hunters, Any Methods Necessary (ECC premium) is a good starting interrupt, as it gives you a jump on pulling bounty hunters.  Jabba&#146;s Through With You (Special Edition uncommon) is good with the permanent weapon characters.  Res Lak Ra&#146;auf (Dagobah rare) is a good destiny adder for hunters.<br>
<br>
Locations:<br>
Many ideas exist for location selection.  My personal preference is using multiple docking bays.  I use Executor DB, Coruscant DB, Death Star 2 DB, and a few others.  I also choose a few drain sites related to the docking bays, but not many.  <br>
Flagship Operations:  Pack lots of systems and Executor locations. Systems will play a major role in this type of deck, and Fondor would come in handy to get the Executor out cheaply.  Endor, Sullust and Kiffex are good locations if you want to drain with this type of deck.  A few planet sites will also be useful for generation, but don&#146;t go overboard. If you use SFS and KDY, include Wakeelmui and Kuat, so you can deploy the related effects.<br>
Troopers:  The locations you include depend on what kind of trooper you are focusing on.  Corulag and Raithal are good systems to improve your troopers, and Cardia can help you recover your troopers.<br>
Scum:  You will need some Jabba&#146;s palace locations, and others that boost aliens and bounty hunters.  Prisons may be necessary too.<br>
Odds:  Choosing force-choke sites may be beneficial, as it will limit your opponent&#146;s ability to deploy.<br>
<br>
Starships:<br>
Executor is practically a must for this type of deck.  I&#146;d use the Dagobah one instead of Flagship for its immunity.  <br>
Bounty Hunter ships are nice for this as well, for their unique abilities.  I would use at least Zuckuss and Dengar in their ships for swarm protection.<br>
A couple of the unique TIE interceptors with their pilots would be a nice addition too, if you have the room.  I would put in at least Fel in his interceptor, so I could use its bonus to SFS 9.3s.  This depends on personal style, and it may be just as easy to swarm as to use unique fighters and Combat Response.  If you do this, watch out for the Admiral&#146;s Orders that decrease power for not having pilots on ships.<br>
Flagship Operations:  You will want to include more ships, especially fighters.<br>
Scum:  Bounty hunters you can spare on the ground should be used in their on-ship personas.  Jabba&#146;s Space Cruiser (Special Edition rare) is a good ship too, if you have an alien you can afford to have pilot it.<br>
<br>
Vehicles:<br>
If you are playing exterior locations, a few walkers can turn the tide of the battle.<br>
Troopers:  Unless you are using troopers on a Death Star or Cloud City, you should include several AT-ATs and AT-STs.  If you are playing biker scouts, of course you should include speeder bikes.  If you are playing indoors at Cloud City or the Death Star, you should include some Lift Tubes to react.<br>
Scum:  The Mobquet A-1 Deluxe Floater (Premiere common2) is a good vehicle, since it moves free and can react to a battle with one of your bounty hunters, thieves, or smugglers.  Skiffs are also good for reacting ability.<br>
<br>
Weapons:<br>
You will want to include at least one copy of Vader&#146;s saber.  The choice of which to use is up to you.<br>
Dueling:  You will also want to include Mara&#146;s Lightsaber (EJP premium) for this type of deck.<br>
Flagship Ops:  You may want some starship weapons if you are using fighters, but it boils down to personal preference.<br>
Royal Guards:  You will want Force Pikes (Death Star 2 common) for your guards.  Any other weapons are up to you.<br>
Troopers:  You can include blasters to boost your troopers and support your saber-wielding characters.  The best weapons for this would be Blaster Rifles (Premiere common2) and Assault Rifles (Premiere rare2), but the Assault Rifle isn&#146;t considered a blaster, so blaster rifles are your best bet.<br>
Scum:  If you don&#146;t have the hunters with permanent weapons, or just want to use other personas for their special abilities, you should include their matching weapons.  Other important weapons may include the Antipersonnel Laser Cannon (Jabba&#146;s Palace uncommon).  You may wish to also include weapons that may be placed on bounty hunter ships.<br>
<br>
As you have undoubtedly noticed, Hunt Down decks use many rare and premium cards, so they are expensive to put together, but they are strong decks if assembled correctly.  Good luck and good hunting.<br>
