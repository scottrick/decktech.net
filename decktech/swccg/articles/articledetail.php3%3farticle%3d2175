Namely, I would like to give thanks to BreakWindu72, 5D6-RA-7, Gand, BadGirl, and Garion. Any people that I may have missed, well I would like to thank you as well. Now, onto the introduction.<br>
<br>
     This article is all about the two objectives from Special Edition, Local Uprising/Liberation and Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control. These objectives were once the predominant decktype around my area and probably yours, but are now rarely seen. Why? There are multiple reasons, such as the advent of all the new objectives out there since the good old days of SpEd (or not so good days) that are much better than these objecives. Also, in case you didn&#146;t know, there has been errata added as well as new rules regarding Operative cards. These characters can no longer provide ability alone, are limited to one per site, and cannot control a site on their own. Before this ruling, anything went, and it did. There were Corulag Ops/Trooper decks and Sandspeeder Clak&#146;dor VII Ops decks running rampant all over the tournament scene. The bonus on the flip side was fairly decent, but the real kick came from the simplicity of flipping the objective. All that was required was to have three battleground &lt;&gt; sites under control, so long as they belonged to your Renegade/Subjugated planet. All it took was a few swarms of Ops played down quickly to flip the objective. While I&#146;m at it, let&#146;s look over these objectives.<br>
<br>
     Local Uprising/Liberation; Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control: LS;DS objective: 0: Deploy any planet system and one &lt;&gt; site to that system. This system is the Subjugated/Renegade planet. Text: WHILE this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one &lt;&gt; site to the Subjugated/Renegade planet from reserve deck; reshuffle. FLIP this card if your matching operatives control at least three battleground sites related to the Subjugated/Renegade planet. <br>
     <br>
     7: WHILE this side up, opponent&#146;s force drains are -1. You may retrieve 1 force each time you deploy a matching operative to the Subjugated/Renegade planet. Your matching operatives on that planet are each forfeit +2 and, when at the same site as an Imperial or AT-ST/Rebel, are each power +2. When you have at least one matching operative in a battle on the Subjugated/Renegade planet, you may add one battle destiny.<br>
<br>
     What does this mean? It means you must get out two sites and one Op to control each of those three (the other one you start with, which should be Farm for light). That&#146;s all you need to do to make his drains -1, add a battle destiny just about everywhere (you SHOULD have an Op at each site), turn your Ops into little monsters, and provide you with continuous retrieval for a small cost. What planets are available for LS Ops? There are currently ten planets available to choose from. Which is best? Which ones suck? Well, just for pointers, Kirdo III, Ralltiir, Kashyyyk, and definetely Alderaan Operatives are a great risk and should be avioded. The rest are all very much alike, with Bothawui Operatives having a small advantage over others. For the Dark Side, there are currently nine different Ops out there, with Corulag Ops having a smaller advantage over others. Unlike the LS Ops, DS Ops are pretty much all similar. What planets are there available for both sides? The list is fairly long, but I don&#146;t mind typing it up: Alderaan LS, Anoat LS/DS, Bothawui LS, Clak&#146;dor VII LS, Corellia LS/DS, Corulag DS, Eriadu DS, Kashyyyk LS/DS, Kessel DS, Kiffex LS/DS, Kirdo III LS, Nal Hutta DS, Raithal DS, Ralltiir LS, and Tibrin LS. The &lt;&gt; sites available currently are (sorry if I miss any): Swamp LS/DS, Spaceport City LS/DS, Spaceport Docking Bay LS/DS, Spaceport Prefect&#146;s Office DS, Spaceport Street LS/DS, Jungle LS/DS, Forest LS/DS, and Farm LS. That&#146;s about enough to give you a general idea of your choices. Now let&#146;s evaluate each, starting with LU/L.<br>
<br>
     Part one: Local Uprising/Liberation: This decktype tore up at worlds a few years back, but is now almost completely dead, save for its ability to pull a system and site, thus giving you a fairly good start. Playing for flip is now made much harder, as well as keeping it flipped. In my experience, this objective is fragile and very hurt by &quot;cancels opponent&#146;s force drain modifiers&quot; type of cards, and especially No Escape. The retrieval is now hurt by the heavy usage of WYS decks, and their DS opponent&#146;s now usually pack a Secret Plans or what not. The power bonus won&#146;t do a thing if the opponent won&#146;t come to you, as well. Also, your choices are limited when you plan on battling off planet, as you will likely have a number of Ops in hand, and not very many other beatdown characters. Your damage potential is fairly low, because of the low incentive for opponents to come get you and drain elsewhere and ignore your little 1+1 (because of the Ops&#146; texts) drains. Indeed, you are quite restricted in a flip Ops deck, but you can still surprise an unwary opponent and maybe even pull off a win. Now that I&#146;ve summed up the pros and cons of this deck, let&#146;s get to the point of the article (finally), shall we?<br>
<br>
     The first variation, and the most powerful (speaking of power in battles), is the Bothawui Operative/Nightfall deck. This variation was discovered and exploited as soon as the objective came out. The general idea with this deck is to play Nightfall on Bothawui, use lots of spies (that deploy for free, by the way), and use the 2X-3KPR droid from Premiere. Your power can skyrocket with very minimal force usage. Some good cards to consider for this type of LU are: Bothan Spies (free deploy!), Undercover (just in case you&#146;re getting outdrained on ground), Leia Organa (yes, you heard me, she&#146;s a spy), Momaw Nadon, CZ-3 (ok, I&#146;ll react these 3 Bothan Spies and a few more), Bothan Spy, Jeroen Webb, Wyron Serper (I should write a whole article on this guy, but not today), Blount and Cracken, It Could Be Worse (what&#146;re you going to do with all that force left over!?!?), strong air but not much, and a lot of high destiny recyclers. This variation is just like any other LS Op deck, however, it can mass up sick power at absolutely NO COST. If the opponent comes down to get you on Bothawui, it&#146;s almost guaranteed you can win most battles out of sheer power. Mara and Alter can be a problem, but Hutt Smooch is not. Undercover (considering you&#146;re using it) is immune to the Smooch while you control Bothawui. Now that you&#146;ve heard the pros, I&#146;ll babble on now about the cons. All cons of Ops deck apply here, plus the fact that you can&#146;t cause much damage at all. You might be able to drain for 7 at most on the flip side, but you cannot do much else and leave yourself vulnerable to beatdowns, even with all that power in there. Your best bet is to play very defensively at first, then you can spread out, at which time you&#146;ll probably be close to dead. This is a good Op deck, but Ops decks suck to begin with, so I&#146;ll rate it second best LU out there.<br>
<br>
     Another variation that can catch people by surprise is the manipulation/musician variant. This type relies on getting out the Swamp for protection, then playing all those crap Bith from Premiere and ANH. While together, their texts are quite entertaining, and can cause real problems for a stupid opponent. I say stupid opponent because canceling a drain of one or two isn&#146;t a priority, especially if he sees all those Bith together. This Op deck uses Clak&#146;dor VII as the Subjugated planet and relies on manipulating the opponent and causing direct damage, rather than drains and battles. Good cards that fit quite nicely in this deck are: Figrin D&#146;an (duh!), Doikk Na&#146;ts, Ickabel G&#146;ont (good Bith), Bith Shuffle, Nalan Cheel (manipulator when Bith Shuffle is used), H&#146;nemthes (just skyrockets the cost for opponent&#146;s beatdowns), Goo Nee Tay (you&#146;ve gotta be kidding me, 21 force to beatdown with just one Vader and Tarkin?), Harc Seff, Neb Dulo, Rebel Barrier, Lirin Car&#146;n (manipulation at its finest), Recoil In Fear, and any other manipulation cards you can think of. Basically, this deck sets up all the musicians at the Swamp and sits there draining, all the while manipulating the DS. Hopefully, the opponent will come down to battle your poor little Modal Nodes, only to run into the surprise that all the prerequisites for battle are modified! These musicians can really screw a lazy opponent that doesn&#146;t realize the power of the musician swarm. This deck is very much a theme deck, indeed, but I pulled off a tournament win once with this deck (probably just dumb luck). The many cons apply here, and are even more numerous. Your musicians only work well together, and thus you cannot spread out and fulfill the requirements to flip the objective without much effort, even more effort if the opponent is playing No Escape. This deck cannot manipulate well because the LS cannot manipulate well to begin with. Manipulation is really a thing of the DS, just look at all their Brangus retrieving, M&#146;iiyoom Onith and SCrew scanning, A Dangerous Time oriented decks out there. The light side is fairly limited to this strategy. I personally dislike this version, but it can be fun to play casually.<br>
<br>
     My third, and final LU deck, is the Clak&#146;dor Speeder variant. This deck relies on flipping the objective, and still works with the new Operative rules. Your ability is provided by a small beatdown force and a large number of Speeders, boosted by T-47 Battle Formation and Maneuvering Flaps. The opponent is not very likely to come down to Clak&#146;dor VII after seeing your Speeders, so you can just drain away, while reducing his drains by one. With half of your deck geared towards winning Clak&#146;dor VII and draining, it does leave room for some good interrupts and effects. Some popular cards include Frozen Assets, Yarna D&#146;al Gargan, Draw Their Fire, and now Ounee Ta. If playing this decktype today, you should consider changing the base to TIGIH, as it provides more power, less focus, and more flexibility. But if you insist on playing LU, then think of doing beatdowns on the opponent&#146;s sites as well as protecting your own. Not too difficult, you&#146;ve played speeders, right? The problem with this decktype is its difficulty in holding anything in space, as well as its focus on Clak&#146;dor. It is too difficult to atttempt winning a game by draining like a maniac on the Subjugated planet. It is a good decktype in one way ,however, and that is the fact alone that it uses speeders. It may still be a viable decktype for the meta, but I&#146;ve yet to see it. If any LU deck of the mentioned three could be declared best, it would be this one. Many decks nowadays have difficulties with speeders, because they can go to docking bays (which are extremely popular), they can take over Endor and not take that huge setback from Perimeter Patrol, they cannot be targeted by most guns, can mass up power for cheap deploy, and hold ability required for the Ops, all the while protecting them and providing them with protection from weapons fire.<br>
<br>
     If I could rate this objective on a scale of one to five, with five being the best possible and zero being the worst possible objective, I would rate this deck 1 1/2 out of 5 stars. Why so generous? This deck is very unpredictable and can maybe pull off one or two surprise wins at a local, and it is cheap to put together, especially for a newbie. When I first started playing Star Wars in tournaments, I had a musician LU put together and it actually won a game. Now I play EBO, but that&#146;s beside the point. This deck lost so many stars because there are so many decks out there that are better than this decktype, both Light and Dark. Also, there are so many commonly used cards out there that have put a real difficulty in playing this objective. The -1 to drains can be evaded with ease by certain cards and objectives, the +2 to power won&#146;t do much if the opponent doesn&#146;t come to you and attempts to outdrain you elsewhere. The retreival is nice and easy to do, but Secret Plans and Come Here You Big Coward! have really hurt retrieval. It isn&#146;t much of a difference, but one force extra during the course of the game can be the difference between win and loss (probably loss anyways though). I&#146;m very sorry to disappoint all of you LU fanatics out there, but it is fact that this objective is hurting. Evidence is that nobody plays Leave Them To Me, because they know they don&#146;t need it to kill ops. Also, Navy Troopers, a well-balanced deck, No Escape, and common sense can easily beat any ops deck out there that plays to flip. That&#146;s my two cents on Local Uprising, and in conclusion, I would like to add that this deck is a great base for a new player who would like to get a general feeling of objectives, control, occupying, and systems/sites. But be sure to change to a better deck once you&#146;re through with this one. I&#146;ve tried so hard to make this deck actually viable after the new ruling, but I just couldn&#146;t do it. I just finally gave up on this objective and deemed it unworthy and binder fodder. Now, onto part two.<br>
<br>
     Part two: Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control: While this objective is very similar to the aforementioned Local Uprising, its array of Operatives is certainly more satisfying. Just in retrospect, Alderaan Operatives are vulnerable to being blown away, Ralltiir Operatives are a calculated risk because of their Subjugated system; it&#146;s too vulnerable to a well-put together Ralltiir Operations deck. Coming back to the point, DS Operatives are not this vulnerable. All their Renegade systems are more or less &quot;no-name&quot;, as I like to call them; they are just there for the purpose of indicating your Renegade planet, nothing else. There is currently no LS deck that focuses on setting up a huge armada at Eriadu or Anoat, however I know a great deal of DS decks that focus on blowing away Alderaan or blockading big-time Ralltiir. For the decktypes I will explain here, it doesn&#146;t really matter which planet you chose to be Renegade, with the exception of my Trooper variant (in which I choose Corulag as my Renegade planet). <br>
<br>
     The first variant of IO/IC is the non flip variant. This type uses the objective solely for the purpose of giving you two starting locations, rather than one. Many people that know of or play the Tatooine force loss decks that exist out there, this card is useful for giving you Tatooine and Desert, both on turn one. This particular decktype relies on setting up large amounts of damage on Tatooine, via We&#146;re In Attack Position Now, Tatooine Occupation, etc. These decks perform so well because of the early activation they obtain. If they also use &lt;&gt; sites, so much the better, as you can pull them from reserve. The problem with this deck is that the objective is really being wasted to a certain extent, and it is usually wiser to start Combat Readiness. On the other hand, starting the objective allows you a starting interrupt that can give you good effect cards, right off the bat. Protecting your assets early on is quite important and generally it&#146;s always better &quot;to be safe than sorry&quot;. I find this type of IO/IC to be the most efficient, the best for today&#146;s meta, and also the most flexible. Maybe you want to start with Dagobah and the Swamp? Or maybe you want to start Yavin 4 and the Jungle? It&#146;s up to you, but of course the best planet location (and probably the best in the whole entire game) is Tatooine. There are so many great Tatooine locations that exist and will always be effective. Whether it be JP or Cantina, Tatooine has so much to offer, especially to the DS. Starting this objective, however, is more geared towards the Imperials taking over Tatooine and causing damage rather than the aliens from Court, MKoS, and what not. Why Imps? Some of them are just great, and they can be more efficient than aliens if used correctly. <br>
<br>
     The second type of IO/IC is the normal flip style. It plays just like any other LS Op deck, but with a greater range of possible characters. The DS has always had a good character selection, and you&#146;ll need it even more so to provide those Ops with protection and ability, as well as providing enough power to safely spread out. Even better are the DS aliens. Most DS aliens center around Jabba (Boelo, Ephant Mon, BFwBR, 4-LOMwCR, etc.) and while with him, they can add multiple destiny and provide other great benefits. Unfortunately, Hutt Influence works only at Tatooine sites, because I was about to mention its usefulness on other planet systems. Other than that, there are many staple cards of popular DS decks that would fit in just perfect in an IO/IC deck. Keep in mind that this objective may not be as effective as Hunt Down and BHBM, but it has its own playing style unique to other DS decks, save Dark Deal. IO/IC is an objective similar to many other &quot;base&quot; decks for the LS (EBO, MBO, LU), where you are required to control X sites to flip (or deploy in EBO&#146;s case). On the flip side, your characters/starships gain X and X benefits. This objective should be treated as such, and thus it is a weak version in the hands of an inexperienced LS &quot;base&quot; player. Most DS decks nowadays focus on controlling only a few sites to get what they want done, but this deck requires you to spread your forces quite thinly. For that purpose, we have something called AT-STs. Ralltiir Ops veterans, you know the deal. AT-STs are great cards because they can react back and forth across your Renegade sites. RalOps players use AT-STs with the Pilots in order to flip the objective because it is efficient, not very card intensive, and protects all of your chicken walkers. Certain Tempest Scouts can carry your Operatives, much like in the mentioned Speeder LU, thus protecting them and providing you with a good reacting vehicle. The biggest problem with this decktype is that only one Operative is allowed per site, so if you have, say, three walkers with an Op aboard each, each at their own sites. The opponent drops, JedLuke with Saber and , umm, Crix Madine. He battles, you react, but WAIT. You just forgot the one Op per site rule, so oops, those AT-STs will just stay where they are. One exception is that the AT-ST already has a permanent pilot, in which case it can let the Op go and sit on a log while it reacts over to the battle scene (remember, you are allowed embarking and debarking before and after a react). If it&#146;s say, TS1, then you cannot react anywhere, because you have no pilot that is able to go to the scene, because of the one Op per site rule.<br>
<br>
     My final variant of IO/IC is probably my favorite, and probably the most effective, as far as flipping goes. It relies on using Corulag as your Renegade planet, so you can gain some benefits from your Troopers. What types of troopers work best? Here&#146;s where it all boils down to preference. Unique troopers? Nah, they wouldnt&#146; gain the benefit from Corulag. Non-unique troopers only, please. Some good choices include Biker Scout Troopers, Imperial Trooper Guards, and run of the mill Stormtroopers. Some very good ideas with this deck are to have an ability &gt; 3 Imp at each site with a Comlink (yes, and use lots of them too!), and a handful of troopers. He comes down to battle, and wham!, you drop down a handful of troopers to assist, play Trooper Assault, You Overestimate Their Chances, and Dark Jedi Presence (considering Vader or Palpy&#146;s there). Do you have any idea what your power is there? Allow me to demonstrate with a scenario of my own. You have Darth Vader sitting at the Forest with a Comlink. He comes down hard with Han and gun, Leia and pea shooter, Obi with stick, and Orrimarko. You look up and laugh as you drop, let&#146;s say, 6 Imperial Trooper Guards to back up Vader. He hits three of your troopers with his guns, you play those three interrupts which I so kindly revealed earlier. Let&#146;s see, his power is 17 + 3 destiny, which were 1, 3, and 4. That&#146;s a total of 25 for him. You have a power of 90 + 1 destiny at +1, which was a 2, made into 3. That&#146;s a total of 25 to 93. He loses 68 force tripled, which is about 204 force total. Hmm, looks like you must lose those 3 Imps and Vader to attrition. He loses what, all his guys, PLUS something like 170 force. Can you say &quot;I must have dropped my Houjix!!!!&quot;? The real problem with this type of deck is that it is so predictable to a smart player that it isn&#146;t even funny. Also, if he uses a Houjix, he&#146;ll know better than to return and fight again. That&#146;s why you have a Skiff nearby. I personally love this deck so much, but I would never bring it to a tournament because of the current meta. I&#146;ve just about named all the cards needed, I&#146;ll just repeat them one more time and add a few little things that help a lot: Stormtrooper Cadet (Obi with stick=1 hit trooper; Leia with Han and Luke, add in Chewie as well=too many battle destinies; Stormtrooper Cadet=priceless; there are some things money can&#146;t buy, for everything else, like losing two hundred battle damage, there&#146;s a Stormtrooper Cadet), An Entire Legion Of My Best Troops, General Tagge, Dark Jedi Presence, Darth Vader, Trooper Assault, You Overestimate Their Chances, Skiff, Imperial Trooper Guard, controlling Corulag, Stunning Leader (AWESOME CARD against Chewie and pals), Abyssin Ornament (swarm then retrieve en masse), and Unexpected Interruption (never know when you need that DJP or Assault). This deck can mass up so much damage against the opponent that you&#146;ll never see battles the same way again. However, as I have said before, this deck reeks from a mile away of power and chicken drain decks will so kill you.<br>

     I hope you have enjoyed reading this article as much as I have enjoyed writing it (actually, it took me a helluva long time) and I do hope you certainly see these objectives as obsolete, but they still pack the surprise factor that can pull off the odd win or two. Also, don&#146;t forget you can play for the non-flip, just to get out that extra site for that edge in activation. With the game so concentrated on activation these decks, these objectives can give you the advantage you may need. As a rating, I give IO/IC a 2 1/2 out of 5 possible stars because of the trooper version which is FUN to play and you&#146;ll remember forever that one game where your opponent cried for his Houjix as he was forced to lose 200 force. Of course, many strategies severely hurt these decktypes, but you never know, one day we may see a recurrence with old Ops (yeah right, but I just had to say it). I hope you have learned something, no matter how small or insignificant, and now see through these objectives and know better what to expect when/if facing one. If you wish to make a better trooper deck that is non-BHBM and non-TDIGWATT, just D-mail me and I can give you some really sick ideas that rack up damage against the opponent. In my next article, I will discuss the two objectives from the third anthology that people are beginning to see the potency in. One of these objectives generally plays non-flip for the extra activation, but can also hold its own while trying to flip. The other must flip for it to begin the damage, and it focuses on destroying the Death Star while deploying a garrison to Yavin. These two objectives are Set Your Course For Alderaan/The Ultimate Power In The Universe and Massassi Base Operations/One In A Million. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2175"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2175"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2175" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
