The first is all about invention:  a person tries his best to create some new deck he's never tried before, then he tweaks it until he believes it to be competitive.  The second method involves taking a deck one has seen from another source, such as the Internet or Scrye, and cloning (copying) it.	Either way is fine, since most of us play for fun; but to be truly competitive in a tournament, I believe that one must be inventive.  Why?  Why can't I take a great, regional-winning deck just like it is on the Internet and use it?  Shouldn't the deck win?  Well, not necessarily. . . . .<br>
<br>
One reason you can't always trust a deck from another source is that it may not be right for your local gaming scene, or meta'.  When many people build decks for tournaments, they anticipate the decks they expect to see in that tournament.  The decks others guess' that people will use do not always make appearances at your local tournaments.  So, therefore, that deck would be better if you changed it to match what you think people will play in your area.  For example, about two months ago I decided to go to a tournament with a Yavin 4 Revolver because I'd heard that many people were winning with it.  I did place first in the tournament, but I encountered a deck that it was weak against Big Blue with TIEs.	I won anyway, but it was a tough game.<br>
<br>
The second reason is related to creativity.  I've seen people who didn't know the exact cards that were in their decks because they took them straight off the Internet!  When you take a deck from the net and don't make it your own, you lose part of the original deck's strength. Because you don't know how to play that specific deck, you've lost much of what you hoped to gain the competitive edge.  This leads to my next major point: it is not the deck that matters, but the player behind it.  Some people can copy decks straight off the Internet and play them perfectly, but the majority of SWCCG players cannot.  The player is more important than the cards.  You will never see an unbeatable deck.  To make a deck that wins every time, regardless of the opponent, is impossible; I'm sure you understand that.  Therefore, what makes the great players stand out from the mediocre players is the ability to utilize each individual resource in their decks to beat their  opponents.<br>
<br>
So how do you make an awesome deck without copying card-for-card a deck on the Internet?  To tell you the truth, most of my decks are inspired by other decks I've seen on the Internet.  Not cloned, but INSPIRED!  That means that I took whatever the person posted and redesigned it to my own tastes and abilities.  Take, for example, the Bothawui Speeder Ops deck I recently posted.	It is quite similar in many ways to Ray Bordier's 'Almost Clint's' deck that is on Decipher's decks page.	Instead of cloning it, though, I tried to make that deck better and customized for my own meta.'  I attempted to utilize his idea and improve it.  I changed a few things: different speeders, 1 less Bothawui Operative, a Leia with Blaster Rifle, a Yoxgit, 1 more starship, 1 more Landing Claw, and no Yub-Yubs.	 But when it comes down to it, I still play the deck in a manner similar to how Ray played it.	Now this deck is my own.<br>
<br>
This article's purpose is not to discourage you from not using other people's decks, but quite the opposite.	Use every resource you have to improve your playing ability including other people's deck types.  You can improve a great deal from analyzing and adapting other people's decks.  That is, in fact, the purpose of Decktech!	Remember, though, that your playing ability is more important than the cards in your deck, so keep improving!
