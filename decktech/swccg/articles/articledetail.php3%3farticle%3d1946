This article is not so much about gameplay, but Decktech itself, so I have no AWESOME new tech to show you,just some thoughts on my favorite site.<br>
<br>
Decktech is a great site, the best for SWCCG. All the best players in the world access it almost every day, and younger newer players can get advice and decks and why certain strategies work, and why some don&#146;t. The administration does a great job, it has loads and loads of information and the D-mail system is a great idea. But, I&#146;m sure you already know all this. What I&#146;m going to talk about in this article is the problems with it, caused by the people on Decktech.<br>
<br>
Politics seem to play a big part on Decktech. The big name players, like Brian Hunter, Clint Hays, Steven Lewis, Twigg and others get huge reviews on their decks, while no name people have a much harder time. I&#146;m not insulting the big name decks, it just seems to me that if a deck like the Invincible Court deck (currently number 1 on Decktech) was submitted by someone besides Steven Lewis, it wouldn&#146;t have had the reviews and the ratings and the FIVE star AVERAGE that Invincible Court has. It is an unbelieveable deck, with almost no weaknesses and deserves to be in the top 10. BUT I think that it wouldn&#146;t be there if, say, Kyle Brem from Boise, Idaho had submitted the same deck with the same strategy. It might have gotten a 4 star average or somewhere around there, while Steven&#146;s deck gets a 5 star average. No offense to Steven Lewis or Kyle Brem, that is just the way I see it.<br>
<br>
Another thing, and I can&#146;t stress this one enough, is all the useless articles submitted to Decktech. I would much rather see 1 or 0 new articles submitted in the last 24 hours, than 4 or 5 ones about NOTHING that are 3-10 lines long, or less. Even if they are written by a 10 year old....<br>
I know much has been said on the subject, but please everyone, if it doesn&#146;t pertain to SWCCG or decktech or revalant, please don&#146;t submit it.<br>
<br>
The next few things I will point out are more personal, based in my own experiences. The purpose of this article is not to slander or insult anyone, so I will not name any names in this section.<br>
<br>
After my Grand Slam victory a couple weeks ago, I was very excited because it was my biggest tournament victory ever. There was only something like 28 people, but some very big names were there. I had won Alabama States, and gotten high ranks at several other tournaments, but it was definately my best tournament victory ever. I was so pumped that I submitted both my decks and wrote a tournament report of the Slam within 3 or 4 days after it. In the tournament report, I mentioned that my younger brother, who is ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD did very well against a incredibly good player, ranked in the top 10 of the world, who for the purposes of this article will be called &quot;Shay.&quot; My TWELVE year old brother had to play this incredible player Shay 3rd round and put him one heck of a fight, only losing by 8 cards. In my tournament report I gave MAD props to my little brother for hanging in there. I did not insult Shay, or say anything against him, only congratulated my brother.<br>
<br>
My TR got a good amount of fair reviews, and the worst one was by Shay. Amidst plenty of those Decktech symbols we all know and love (you know, @#$%), Shay said that I should not be proud of my Grand Slam victory because it only had 20 something people and that he totally dominated my brother from the 4th turn on. I do not believe that this is the way people on Decktech should behave. I don&#146;t think my article deserved a 1 star rating because I was pleased for having won the tournament, or because I mentioned that my brother hung in there with such an amazing player. It might have been another story if I was slandering good players, but I wasn&#146;t at all, as you can see if you read my report.<br>
<br>
Another thing I&#146;ve noticed is that way too many people review decks with good or bad reviews that do nothing to help the deck out. They say things like &quot;Nice deck,&quot; &quot;Good Job,&quot; or &quot;This deck sucks&quot; and offer no advice to make the deck better. Now I know some players have worked with decks for months to perfect them, and don&#146;t want help with their decks, because they are perfect finished copies. But, the majority of the decks submitted by no name players are submitted to enhance the deck, especially if someone asks for advice in their strategy section. In your review of a deck like this, make sure to include a line or two of advice for the player. Maybe his deck is weak to SAC, or it has no protection against EBO... Let him know what the problem is, don&#146;t just say the deck stinks!<br>
<br>
For example, a few days ago I submitted a brand new deck I had just built. It was a Power of the Hutt, Perimeter Patrol deck with Ephant Mon guarding the Bunker and massive ground drains. In my strategy section, I specifically asked for new ideas in the deck because I like the concept of the deck, but I wasn&#146;t sure what to do with it. Should I play SAC, or should I add Crush The Rebellion and 2 Evaders to help fight Revos? Currently this deck has 3 reviews on it. 1 person gave me 4 stars and said that Ominous Rumors might be a good addition to the deck. I greatly appreciate this review, although I want to concentrate on ground drains, so I will probably not take his advice. Another reviewer game me 4 stars and said &quot;Because I know how hard it can be to play against this kind of deck. I hate the elephant-man!&quot; I don&#146;t mind this review, but it doesn&#146;t give me any ideas on how to make the deck better. My third review comes from Shay, who is apparently still mad at me for being proud of me GS victory. He gives a a half star, and tells me it is a pile of @#$%. I rarely think a deck deserves the 1/2 star rating at all, especially if they are trying to build a good deck, but as I had submitted this deck for help, I wouldn&#146;t have minded getting a 1/2 star rating if I had been given some advice on what to do with the deck. However, telling me it is a pile of @#$% and not telling me what makes it a pile of @#$%, or how to improve it doesn&#146;t do ANYTHING for me. These are the kind of reviews I hate.<br>
<br>
Finally, don&#146;t people realize that anyone can go and give 1/2 star ratings to good decks for no reason? It doesn&#146;t make you cool, it doesn&#146;t make you powerful, but usually makes you look stupid. Here&#146;s what I mean. If you haven&#146;t seen Deadbolt (one of this months top rated decks, submitted by Clint Hays) I thouroughly suggest you check it out. I can tell by looking at it that it would be a BEAST in the hands of a good player. If I had to play against Clint using that totally teched out deck, I&#146;m not sure what I would do. Lose, most likely. I can see a few very small weaknesses in the deck, but overall it is one of the best decks LS has to offer. One day I was reading the reviews of it, and all were above 3 stars, because every one could see the power of the deck. However, down at the very bottom of the page there was a 1/2 star review that said something along the lines of &quot;Let us know if you ever actually build your own deck, GayMaster.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now whether or not Clint built that deck is not the issue. I&#146;ve never seen anywhere that you should give a deck a bad review if the person who submitted it didn&#146;t build it. There are tons of slight variations of the biggest deck types, EBO, BHBM, Hidden Base, and the deck, except for 5 cards may be a complete copy of someone else&#146;s, but the 5 cards can make all the differerence in the world! That 1/2 star rating was long ago deleted by the GameMaster himself, no doubt, but I don&#146;t think it was a fair review at all.<br>
<br>
And I have one last story to tell, one more point to make before I wrap up. Recently I reviewed a deck that was a fairly solid deck, but had an AWFUL strategy section, saying something along the lines of this (note: this is not the exact strategy section, but what I remembered of it. The actual strategy was very similar to this, though.):<br>
&quot;I don&#146;t care what you think of my deck. I am way better than most of you and I know better also, so if you think this deck is bad you suck so look at the deck real hard and think and you might figure it out.&quot; I will not include his name, because this is not meant to insult him, but to prove a point.<br>
<br>
For him to say that he is way better than most people on Decktech seems very @#$%y and inaccurate to me. I looked up his rating, and found it to be solid, something around 1920 that put him at around 150 in the world. Since almost all the best players in the world are on Decktech, I imagine that there are at least 100 players better than him, and his comment that &quot;I am way better than most of you&quot; especially made me mad. As I looked over his deck, I thought it might deserve 4 stars, but his strategy section was AWFUL and I reviewed it with 3 stars saying something along the lines of &quot;This deck sucks. EPP Luke and Obi are much better for Hit and Run missions than Han and Leia, and if you are using suicide EPPs to attack gound, Draw Their Fire is a MUST. Also, just for your information, you are not better than me and I still think this is a bad deck.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking back on it, I probably was a little rough on him, but I do not think he deserved more than 3 stars because of his awful strategy section. Anyway, when I got on Decktech the next morning, I saw that my Decktech rating had dropped about 300 points, and wondered why. When I got to looking at some of my decks, I noticed that the player I gave 3 stars to had come and reviewed every one of my submissions with 1/2 star saying dumb things like &quot;what you give you will recieve.&quot; Well, I gave 3 stars and a fair review, but got 1/2 star for no reason. I could have easily gone to all his submissions and done the same, but I feel that I am bigger than that, and it would have been petty and cheap to give him awful ratings for no reason. Instead I sent a D-mail to the Decktech administration and explained the situation, and Neal was kind enough to remove all of his bogus reviews from my decks and TRs. My point is that it would have been easy to start a fued with this player. I could have given him 1/2 star on all submissions, and even gotten my friends and my brother to do the same, but that would accomplish nothing. I believe that the 1/2 star rating should be used VERY sparingly and never given to any player who tries his best. What I&#146;m trying to say is that everyone can give bad reviews, so what is the point?<br>
<br>
Well, I hope that you&#146;ve either enjoyed this article or learned something or maybe even both. Decktech is a great site, but can easily be ruined by some of the dumb things I have mentioned.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading until the end, and I hope I didn&#146;t bore you too much-<br>
