<br>
The Light Side has several current decks that make use of Cloud City.  We know that the 'City in the Clouds' is loaded with interior sites.  Cloud City joined with a Mains and Toys theme and use of Path of Least Resistance (while shutting down DS with Insurrection) arguably gives the LS a big advantage in this theatre.<br>
<br>
The new ECC expansion offers an interesting new objective - Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation that appears to encourage the use of these types of decks.  Ill reprint the text for clarity here:<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 Force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations. {Flip} this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City). {Place} out of play if Bespin is 'blown away'.<br>
<br>
Interesting.  The card forces a balance between site and sector control.  Now the flip side:<br>
<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and [independent] starships are immune to attrition &lt; 4. At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your [independent] starships are deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. {Flip} this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors). {Place} out of play if Bespin is 'blown away'.<br>
<br>
It then forces system control.	If you cannot keep Bespin you cannot benefit from the objective.<br>
<br>
I think this could be a solid, if subtle, objective.  Battle Plan would appear to be an important option as would Cloud City Celebration.  The obvious system that needs to be occupied is Bespin.  How to maintain control or occupation of the system long enough to win the drain/retrieve race?<br>
<br>
I would anticipate many variations in decks for holding two or three Cloud City sites.	Mains and Toys in infinite combination, ability four aliens that take advantage of the immunity to attrition offered by Independent Operation, Lando Calrissian is also bound to be in virtually every deck of this type.<br>
<br>
The question I am interested in answering is this: what are the best cards to do this with?  I would assume that Captain Han and his trusty ship would be featured in this deck but thats probably not enough.	I discarded cloud cars as they cannot assist in holding Bespin.  Depending on taste and card availability other ships would be needed.	I have narrowed the choices down to several contenders with pros and cons based on how I am trying to implement my strategy for winning consistently with the deck.  You may not agree with some of my card choices!<br>
<br>
Z-95 Head Hunter and Z-95 Bespin Defense Fighter  These are the cards Decipher suggests.  They are granted immunity to attrition from the flipped objective and deploy for one force.  Destiny is three.  The pilot suspension is nice as higher forfeit aliens could be placed on board to inhale attrition.  The card works with Incom Engineer for some extra attrition dealing as well as Incom Corporation.  I am going to try to implement the docking bay searching text of the objective OR of Insurrection to get Hoth: Docking Bay as the interior Rebel Base site for using Incom Corporation.  They are capable in the clouds as well, especially the Bespin Defense Fighter as it retains its cloud power bonus at Bespin: Cloud City for a power of four with no other modifiers.  A seemingly good choice.<br>
<br>
X-Wing Fighters  These are another solid choice and are widely used in the Hidden Base X decks.  S-Foils would allow the great power bonus and would not hamper the X-Wings movement from sector to sector or sector to system.  Organized Attack could provide immunity to attrition as they are not independent they would not enjoy the immunity granted from the objective nor the deploy 1 bonus.	Incom Engineer could assist as well.  Incom Corporation might also be used as well.  I like Incom Corporation because its power can be exploited all over the table and not just at the locations related to the Engineer.  Another good choice.<br>
<br>
Y-Wing Fighters. Other than the capability for adding passenger or pilot forfeit fodder I cant see these being very useful.  Low Deploy is alright.  Poor power and forfeit with no real augmentation potential other than Organized Attack which can be sensed.  At least the Corporation is immune to Alter and the Engineers are characters!  Destiny of three is fine.  Koensayr Manufacturing would be difficult to keep up reliably and too many Special Modifications would be required.  I prefer cards that would enhance the starships of choice as a whole.<br>
<br>
B-Wing Fighters.  Great power.	Even greater deploy of three  not good.  S-foils make them gross at a power of six a piece.  Slayn and Korpil is interesting but probably not practical in this deck.  No other enhancer is available for immunity.  Which could be a good thing as the other toys I have suggested could just be replaced by more B-Wings.<br>
<br>
I envision playing with Pucimer Thryss and no cloud sectors.  Flipping the objective and quickly moving the starfighters to Bespin to establish control is probably the way I plan to work the deck.  Relying on Mains and Toys and aliens to hold Cloud City Locations and retrieving two or three force per turn with Cloud City Celebration.<br>
