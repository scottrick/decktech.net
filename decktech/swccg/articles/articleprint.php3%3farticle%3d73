<br>
Okay, you&amp;#8217;re looking over your newest deck, you got the locations you need, just the right characters and some kickin&amp;#8217; interrupts, you&amp;#8217;re ready to go and win DecipherCon, right?  Well, one of the most commonly forgotten things when making a deck is sense/alter protection.	It happens to me quite often.  You could be in for a long day if you play against a player with 6 senses and 5 alters, what can you do against this?<br>
<br>
1:  well, the most obvious, you can play tons of sense/alters yourself.<br>
<br>
Playing with SA yourself gives you many options.  Not only does it give you a chance when playing other heavy SA decks, you can also cancel your opponents interrupts and effects, giving you an extreme advantage if they don&amp;#8217;t have the appropriate counters.  But this strategy takes up around 10 card slots, requires you to play a certain character base (mains and toys) and is vulnurable to SA counters listed in this article.<br>
<br>
2:  The objectives, Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi / MWYHL<br>
<br>
These two are very common objectives that counter Sense and Alter fairly consistantly.	Both adds 4 to your opponents S/A destinys and when you flip them, the opponent can&amp;#8217;t play S/A at all. MWYHL takes a very long time to flip and requires a very dedicated deck if you plan to flip it, so many people simply use the MWYHL to pull out dagobah and yoda&amp;#8217;s hut and yoda, and play mains and toys.  Hunt Down is fairly easy to flip but hard to keep flipped, some people have played Hunt Down with a large SA package of their own.  This can be very powerful if you can keep Hunt Down flipped, when you can SA stuff but your opponent can&amp;#8217;t.  The problem with these objectives is that while the +4 makes SA difficult, it doesn&amp;#8217;t make SA impossible.  It is possible for the opponent to draw a lucky destiny at a very important time and change the tide of the game in one turn.  (example, sensing focused attack, altering bacta tank)  For the Light Side, a card to combine with MWYHL is For Luck from the jedi pack, this makes SA impossible for the DS.  The problem with this is A) it requires you to start with a less than optimal effect and B) it requires you to save one force when ever you play an interrupt, or when you have an effect on the table.  And you need to save one force at all times if you want to prevent For Luck from being altered.  The Dark side equivalent, Dark Forces, is not as effective when combined with Hunt Down because the LS has 4 characters with ability 5+ (Luke, Obi, Yoda, DOS)<br>
<br>
3:  There is No Try/Do Or Do Not<br>
<br>
These two cards are pretty limited and do exactly the same thing.  When they are deployed, Sense and Alter are both lost interrupts and the player who plays them has to lose 2 cards, effectivly making who ever plays Sense and Alter lose 3 force each time.  Over the course of a game this loss can be substantial.  The problem with these cards is that your opponent can still cancel your important interrupts and effects.  Lose 3 force is nothing when used to sense a nabrun or a clash of sabers.  So TinT and DODN can&amp;#8217;t be trusted to protect your interrupts.  However, if your deck relies on a bunch of reacting biker scouts, There is No Try can be more effective than usual because you are not losing any cards when they sense, just make sure that you can react enough guys, you don&amp;#8217;t want a sense to cancel an important react, making you not able to draw battle destiny or something.  Another trick I like is to run drazin manip with heavy S/A and start with There is No Try, early in the game, I&amp;#8217;d sense /alter lots of stuff and put cards from my reserve into my lost pile, allowing me to access important cards with drazin, you don&amp;#8217;t want to overdo it, but it could be useful.<br>
<br>
4:  Oppressive Enforcement/Wise Advice<br>
<br>
In my opinion these cards are the most versatile anti S/A cards, each offering two bonus effects other than the anti-SA benefit of having all cards canceled by S/A to be put into your used pile.  For example, a big blue deck can utilize all three of Oppressive Enforcement&amp;#8217;s effects by running grabbers and having ships, while a dagobah train deck can also use wise advice effectivly.  These cards are great to have if you run a lot of recycling destiny 5s.  the problem with these cards stem along the same lines as TinT and DODN in that your opponent can still play Senses and Alters at will, cancelling your important interrupts and effects.<br>
<br>
5:  Grabbers and Controls<br>
<br>
These cards are both great by themselves, grabbers (What are you trying to push on us for light and There&amp;#8217;ll be Hell to Pay for dark) allow you to make every Sense or Alter in your opponent&amp;#8217;s deck a lost interrupt and also increases the cost to play them, while Control simply cancels sense/alter while being immune to sense.  However, it is when you use these two cards in tantum that their power really shows.  You could play an important interrupt, and when your opponent senses, you grab and control, and they&amp;#8217;ll often find themselves with 0 or 1 force and not able to sense again.  This requires good timing on your part to make sure your opponent has no force, it is also somewhat force intensive (you&amp;#8217;d need to save 7 force to monnok, for example)  but it can completely leave you opponent helpless at a critical time. When I do play these two cards in tantum, I usually go with 2 grabbers and 3 controls.  And if you don&amp;#8217;t play against SA decks, these two cards are still very useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the end, I&amp;#8217;d recommend playing either playing SA yourself, or playing two of the other choices to make sure that you can effectivly play against a Heavy SA opponent.  Which ones you go with depends on your deck and style, There Is No Try for heavy react decks, Opressive Enforcement/Wise Advice for decks with recyclers or ones that can use the other parts of their text.  For decks that rely on useful interrupts, I&amp;#8217;d use a combination of Oppressive enforcement/Wise Advice and grabbers + controls.  Hope this helps, and sorry for any spelling/grammer errors, its not a good idea to run a spell checker when writing a star wars article. :-)<br>
