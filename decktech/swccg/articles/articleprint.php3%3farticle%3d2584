A &quot;hoser&quot; is a card that either cancels a particular card or a popular deck strategy.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, the most powerful cards in the game had &quot;hoser&quot; cards to counter them as a method of keeping their power in check.  Cards such as Revolution had Evader etc.  It wasn&#146;t until the release of the Dagobah expansion that there was a necessity for there to be a &quot;hoser&quot; card for the overpowering strategy numbers.  Since that expansion there have been &quot;hosers&quot; for almost every popular decktype constructed, in an attempt for Decipher to push newer strategies while keeping older, overplayed strategies for being played as much.  Some of these cards have incredible play value, others do not.  Let me first discuss what I feel are the necessary hoser cards to play and which are most viable.  Then I will discuss the idea of hosers cards, their pro&#146;s and con&#146;s and how they are changing the shape of the game.<br>
<br>
Necessary &quot;Hosers&quot;:<br>
Your Insight Serves You Well/You Cannot Hide Forever:  I don&#146;t need to explain the raw power of numbers.  There have been more &quot;hoser&quot; cards made to counter the numbers strategy, than any other strategy to date.  But numbers are still played throughout this.  I feel these two cards are a must in every deck with the exception of a numbers deck itself.  It doesn&#146;t take a genius to realize that if you do not play this card, you will lose to a numbers deck.  If you feel that numbers are dead YOU ARE WRONG.  They still remain the most easily abused tactic in the game, and if you do not have protection from them, you will lose.<br>
<br>
Ounee Ta/No Escape:<br>
These cards win games.  They both provide all the defense necessary from an operatives deck (few and far between I know, but still viable).  Ounee Ta also doubles as protection against Ral Ops which still remains a dangerous objective.  No Escape doubles as a &quot;hoser&quot; for Honor Of The Jedi which is still an incredible card.  And both of these cards have an AMAZING ability of letting you take the top card of your lost pile into your hand, this is huge.  Need that Elis Helrot or Vader?  Play On The Edge, then use Ounee Ta and play it again.  Good card.<br>
<br>
Honor Of The Jedi/Come Here You Big Coward:<br>
These cards do different things but they follow the same principal of punishing the opponent into having some battlegrounds to do what they want to do.  Honor is the better of the two, but Come Here You Big Coward is good as well.  Honor, although there is a &quot;hoser&quot; for it, is still an amazing card that prevents more damage than I can tell (ex. Visage, Bring Him Before Me, There Is No Try, You May Start Your Landing, etc).  Come Here You Big Coward stops non-battleground drains and is a huge killer of retrieval against: Profit, MWYHL, RST, Podracing etc.  Also if you think about it, most On/Off The Edge retrieval is done late in the game when the opponent usually only has one battleground.<br>
<br>
Do Or Do Not&amp;Wise Advice/There Is No Try&amp;Oppressive Enforcement:<br>
Sense/Alter remains a huge part of this games. These are hosers to play if you are not playing Sense/Alter yourself.  If you are playing Sense/Alter you should still possibly play the original Wise Advice and Oppressive Enforcement just in case you lose a SAC war.  SAC really hurts if you have no protection from it.<br>
<br>
There&#146;ll Be Hell To Pay/What&#146;re You Trying To Push On Us:<br>
Many decks try to abuse interrupts.  Brangus Glee superstar w/Put All Sections On Alert, WYS with Harvest, How Did We Get Into This Mess with any deck that tries to abuse that card.  Many good players can cycle around their best interrupts with ease, this is a good way to keep that from happening.  Great against SAC, but you all know that.<br>
<br>
Don&#146;t Do That Again:<br>
Mobilization Points still remains a major method of DS force generation.  If you have this in your deck, you are gonna win.  People still try to pull Mobilization Points off, you might want to consider this card.<br>
<br>
Pro&#146;s and Con&#146;s of &quot;Hoser&quot; cards.<br>
It seems whenever a &quot;hoser&quot; card is released people immediately take different looks on it.  Some love it, some hate it.  The biggest argument against &quot;hoser&quot; cards come down to this.  The game seems to be that the person with the appropriate &quot;hoser&quot; card in their deck will win the game and the person who wasn&#146;t lucky enough to guess what &quot;hosers&quot; they needed loses.  Well I counter this argument by saying, if you are a good player you will read the meta and know which hosers to play.  You will make a deck that will not be hosed easily and do well in the environment.  Someones gonna win, if someone else can win so can you.   The biggest argument for &quot;hoser&quot; cards is that they change the shape of the current environment.  I must admit, change is a good thing in this game, how boring would it get if Hunt Down and Throne Room Mains were still the only decks anyone played with.  Hosers put an end to overabused old strategies and clear a path for new fresh ones to thrive.<br>
<br>
That is all I have to say about &quot;hoser&quot; cards, but on one last note, this new set is keeping this tradition alive.  In case you have not seen it yet, one of the most powerful &quot;hoser&quot; cards ever is going to be in the Coruscant expansion.  Here&#146;s the gametext:<br>
<br>
They&#146;re Still Coming Through<br>
<br>
Used Interrupt      Destiny 4<br>
<br>
Cancel Rebel Barrier, It&#146;s A Trap! or Smoke Screen.  OR Re-target Fallen Portal by choosing up to two of opponent&#146;s characters there instead of your own.  OR Peek at the top card of your Force Pile; either return it, or place it under your Force Pile or Reserve Deck.<br>
<br>
This card is good.  Cancels four popular light side cards and also has a good second function, don&#146;t underestimate this card.<br>
<br>
Another mystery solved.<br>
