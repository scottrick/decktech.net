I would like to explain where this article came from and what I would like to accomplish through it. I have been playing SWCCG since it&#146;s inception in 1995. Despite an early interest in the game, players were scarce. I was able to play with my brother in law, though he spent more time and money on restoring his Maverick. Because of this I never played with much consistancy and eventualy stopped playing the game due to lack of people and justifying spending the money for a game I did not play that often and a new family to support. That was  until about a year and a half ago when Reflections came out. Once seeing the foils I started collecting the set. Since I did not discover Reflections until March packs were scarce but I was able to find a local store that had it and it was the first comic store in my area that had an open gaming night and activly promoted CCGs other than Magic. It was then I started playing SWCCG again. I didn&#146;t find anyone to play consistantly until late Sept. of 2000. Gary was a Magic player who grew disenchanted and had a BB Vader he was interested in selling. I was able to talk him into playing SWCCG while I began to play Magic casualy. He picked up the game rapidly. I mentioned I thought his previous TCG experience helped him learn relearn the game and he happened to mention that he thought that some of the Star Wars deck types were similar to those in Magic. That thought turned into my head but I did nothing about it. Then spring 2001 we attended PA States. I don&#146;t know who it was I overhead someone make the comment that SWCCG copied a lot from Magic. I was intrigued by the statement thought a bit about it and shelved the idea. With the release of appocalypse I was able to teach my wife magic (with hopes that one day I will be able to talk her into playing Star Wars :) ) and picked up some theme decks for the set.  Once thinking about a casual game that I play for fun and the varied theme decks the pieces fell into place. There indeed is a correlation between deck types even some concepts within Magic and Star Wars. If we understand it we can construct decks better and build more decks that suit our play style alowing the game more enjoyable. This can be done by looking outside the SWCCG Box. <br>
<br>
     The first thing to look at is the premise. In Magic you are a mage pairing off against another mage and you are trying to kill him. You have a deck of cards that consists of land and spells to accomplish this goal. You both start at 20 life. Star Wars is similar you are either the Good Guys or the Bad Guys and your object is to kill your opponent whether he is LS or DS. You both start with 60 life or 60 cards in your reserve deck, force pile, and used pile. The cyclical nature of Star Wars was expanded from the initial Idea from WotC. (editor&#146;s note WoTC would use something similar to SW in Battletech TCG the Stockpile). In magic you can bring a deck of at least 60 cards though the total can be higher. Star Wars took this idea and meddled with it a bit starting with Jabba&#146;s Palace. I know you are thinking, &quot;He is out of his mind.&quot; but bear with me and think about this. Ever since Jabba&#146;s Palace the creative team at Decipher had been allowing you to bring a reserve deck that has no more than 60 cards but not a fixed number.   The starting Interupts the objectives give you a jump start in play (expanded idea to MTG) but it also means less cards in your reserve deck and it varies dependig if you start an objective and your choice of starting interupt. This means less things that you can do when the game starts similar to the larger deck in Magic. Examples my DS Tatooine Mains deck started three cards. This allowed more mains and 2  and 3 destiny cards for my Tatooine Occupation and Hidden Weapons. My Hunt down deck starts 9 cards this means I have 6 less cards for deuling deul adders and other direct damage approaches than my Tat Mains.<br>
<br>
	The card types are similar between the two games as well. Lands have been turned into location cards. Artifacts and some enchantments turned into effects, sorceries and interupts are interupts in SWCCG, and Creatures are split into character and starship cards. Enchantments can be either effects (as mentioned previously), devices, weapons or Admirals Orders. The first thing you notice in a Magic deck is the large number of land in a deck. You need your lands to produce mana (force in SW).  Most mana generation from lands maximizes at about of 20 . If you take a look at the maximum force generation from your locations in SWCCG you find that it also maximizes out a little below 20 (usualy 8-10 locations with 2 force icons each in most cases your opponent will give you 2-3 force from thier locations as well +1 force for yourself). From mana generation you can cast spells (play cards). Just as mana is important to win in Magis. So is force generation neccessary in Star Wars. If you do not put alot of locations in your decks make sure you have other cards that can generate force for you, or cards that can pull the locations from your deck. This is just like in Magic. Moxes and other artifacts or a creature you can tap for mana goes a long long way. The point is when you build your deck make sure you are generating enough force. If not adjust it. <br>
<br>
	The next application of this correlation is if you have a 60-65 card magic deck that you like to play and is sucessful at winning look at it&#146;s card structure you can use that as a guide as to how much of each card you should put into a deck that you will enjoy playing. Now you normaly don&#146;t want to put in more than 10 locations (I wouldn&#146;t go lower than 7 unless you have a really good reason)  so any extra space you would get with lands try adding cards that will complete and build on the existing strategies in your new deck. (we will discuss these strategies by looking at the colors of magic in M:TCG). It works best if you complete one strategy instead of several weak ones. If you focus on several strategies you are probably going to watter things down so that you will most likely not be able to accomplish the goals you set forth. Ie. you do not see goblins in a flying deck. <br>
<br>
     Think back to the deck type that you enjoy playing in magic. Is it stompy or burn? Maybe you prefer to ping damage with flyers or shadow that others can  not block  or swarm your opponent under with weenies. Perhaps you enjoy frustating the opponent with counter spells or preventing damage instead. Either way this is important. Star wars has deck styles that accomadate theses styles of play. I will give a word of warning not all of these kind of decks will be unbeatable or even good so use caution while designing your decks. If it sucks scrap the idea and try something similar. The result  here is this: you should play FASTER and BETTER against your opponent. This is because you have PLAYED SOMETHING SIMILAR in Magic and UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS BEHIND IT. This is extremely useful when new sets come out.<br>
<br>
     The basic deck type for green is Stompy. Stompy decks are populated with a lot of larger creatures. These can be cast rather quickly because green has alot of ways of boosting your mana generation rather rapidly. The advantage of supperior mana generation is that you are playing 4/4 or better creatures while your opponent can only generate enough to cast 2/2. Winning this match up you win the game. Green also has a tendancy to have the attribute trample. Trample allows you to apply your damage to more than one creature that is blocking you. If it gets a good start Stompy can be quite difficult to stop. It is similar to a double tractor trailer decending the Rocky Mountains without any brakes. If it goes too fast it will crush all those small compacts that gets in its way leaving the carnage behind for someone else to clean up.<br>
<br>
	The equivellant deck archetype to stompy is your mains and toys deck. Here you play with the higher powered (mains) characters and thier matching weapons (toys). BHBM and TIGIH are good examples. To turn the offending character you must win battles, which is the focal point of a mains deck. The mains cost more to deploy so if you want a fast start you need to do what Stompy does and find ways to increase your force generation. This can be done most inefficently by putting more locations in your deck. This is inefficient because you have more zeros floating in your deck that you can draw for destiny. and if you happen to draw it into your hand after you are generating enough force, then  it is wasted compared to that main you need or card that will enhance your main. Staging Areas and Mobilazation Points can enhance your generation (beware Don&#146;t Do that Again) as well as characters that add to your force generation. Ithorians, B&#146;ommar Monks, Jedi Masters can all add force. Sei Tai and Mas Amada adds to generation with Chancelor Valorum. Locations that can be pulled from the reserve deck help as well. Non Unique Battlegrounds in Ops decks or Tatooine and Correlia in a WYS objective. Death Star locations in SYCFA. Revolution and Beggar work too. They will be covered better in maniulation (black). Security Precautions adds to force generation. Mindful of the Future and it&#146;s counterpart Nemodian Adviser can pull battlegrounds from your reserve. <br>
<br>
	Just like Magic it is not good enough to generate even with your opponent but to get the superior force generation over your opponent. If I generate enough to deploy Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarken while you can only deploy Luke I will win the battle and eventualy the war. Star Wars takes this concept a bit further though. It is not good enough to say If I generate more force than my opponent I will win. Some decks can thrive on low force generation totals For Example Hunt Down w/ pod racing needs only to deploy a few characters  and then not in mass. If they can do this DS can win. Star Wars takes the mana generation maxium and expands it to If the amount of force I generate above the amount I need is greater than the amount my opponent generates and needs I should win.  <br>
<br>
	Finaly there is the forfit effect. To damage my opponent I must win battles in a mains and toys deck. If I win by three force and have a destiny draw of 5 for attrition my opponent just forfits one charater of forfit 7 from the table and the battle continues next turn. I am not making much progress in force loss. I did not cause a loss from his hand let alone his reserve deck! A wily opponent can out Force drain me at other locations and win the game. I need a game effect like trample from magic to increase the damage to my opponent. First are cards like Fallen Portal or X-Wing Cannon or Sorry About the Mess for the LS. Trample, Dr. Evzan, Iggy w/ Riot Gun or Sniper for the DS dp similar. These cards allow me to remove cards either before I battle or during battle.  This reduces my opponent&#146;s power for greater damage. But it also does something more insidious. It reduces the amount of cards they can forfit from that location to satisfy battle damage.  If I can clear the site to a low power low forfit character then I can cause real damage on thier force pile. If not thier force pile then his or her hand. If my opponent has no cards to play he must draw them and that also reduces the amount of cards in the reserve deck. These cards are good but they are not the real trample cards of SWCCG. That distinction is left to matching weapons. Matching weapons allows me hit an opponent to force them to forfit a certain character. This is good but it is even better if you can reduce thier forfit to zero. That way they have to lose that character AND another to satisfy battle damage or attrition.  <br>
<br>
	The most prevelant red deck in Magic is the burn or simple burn deck. This deck is based on direct damage. It contains alot of spells that will deal either damage to your opponent or his creatures. Cards such as Zap and Fireball come to mind. (Fireball is much better). Sometimes these decks contain a few characters to help protect against swarm decks. Lightning Elemental or Shivan Dragon come to mind.  Shivan Dragon is a main beast like some of the green cards above. The Lightning Elemental has haste to speed up the damage process. Still creatures are at a minimum in this deck. The normal way of dealing with creatures is to cast an interupt that will directly damage the creature that is hurting you. It&#146;s play style is simple as in the archetype name. Draw an instant cast and target that which is hurting you or will hurt you for turns to come. If you are doing well tagert the opponent mage. A positive point is that you really don&#146;t need alot of mana to play this deck few spells have the X casting cost that pumps things up.  Since you only draw one card a turn you only need to cast one spell per turn. You also want to draw spells not land in this type of deck (gotta kill em all) so it goes hand in hand with a lower land count. <br>
<br>
	Direct Damage has it&#146;s own deck type in Magic. In SWCCG direct damage is difficult to turn into a deck type. So many times the direct damage cards are included as an after thought or enhance the damage to a drain deck and sometimes the mains deck. The DS Occupation cards are good examples of the direct damage augmenting a strategy.  Destroyer Droids or Panaka&#146;s Blaster has a direct damage facet to the card and it enhances the other abilities on the card. Rebel and Imperial Artilary cards add a pain factor to the few weapons you put in your decks (the recycling 7 is an added plus as well). COTVG can cause direct damage but the idea here is not the damage itself but to lure your opponent to tatooine. There the flip side can put a hurt on the opponent with extra direct damage and retrieval. If you would happen to add Tatooine Occupation it can get quite sick at times. BHBM is another example of Direct Damage to augment a strategy. This example is more balanced though. With Vader at a battleground if Luke isn&#146;t at a battleground site the Light Side takes 3 damage a turn. This encourages the opponent to deploy Luke to a battleground. Where the DS can attempt to capture luke and turn him to the Dark Side of the Force. The BHBM deck is balanced becouse on the 7 side the direct damage now goes against the Dark Side for one force loss a turn. This encourages the light to deploy Luke straight to Vaders battleground. This also can play into the opponents hands.  Maul&#146;s Landing Site is a pain factor for a Hunt the Queen Deck. Search and Destroy is a good counter vs space swarm decks causing 1 force loss per draw phase. Security Precautions adds a one time direct damage against flipping hidden base decks. Pod racing does direct damage as well but the pod racing mechanic is so much more than just a burn tactic. Read &quot;I Did It!&quot; for the light side. These aspects I will include in my second article (given that there is demand for it.)<br>
<br>
	The issue of direct damage would be incomplete if I said it only augmented deck types. There is one deck archetype from the start of objectives that has dominated the tournament scene. Since its inception you needed to have a plan as to how to beat it. If you did not encounter it you were lucky. This objective is Hunt Down.   HDADTJ starts right away with direct damage. Visage of the Emperpr starts the force loss for both players at the end of each players turn. But once Vader hits a battleground the objective flips and the force loss comes from the LS only. A first turn Vader is much like the Lightning Elemental in Magic. The objective can be flipped back to the 0 side by deploying Luke or a Jedi to a battleground. This feeds into a deuling HD players plans. He will move Vader to the offending Jedi&#146;s location and deul. This deck sports high destiny and should on a law of averages win the deul. If you track your odds of winning increase greatly. With epic deul deployed with the objective the offending jedi upon loss of the deul is placed out of play and more direct damage is heaped upon the opponent. Search and Destroy is added to help compete against space decks. Counter Assault was added and those who could track thier destinies now could counter higher force drains and add force loss onto the opponent.  Due to all the direct damage and a small force drain eventualy the opponent would crumble under the wieght of this force loss. This loss was rarely ever caused in battle. Honor of the Jedi put a damper in this deck type for a while but Decipher countered in JPOSD with No Escape which breathed new life into this deck type. <br>
<br>
	Then Tatooine hit the metagame. Qui-Gon&#146;s immunity to atrition and lack of deployment restrictions meant that hunt down would stay on the zero side unless you could hit him with a lightsaber or found a sneaky way of removing him. Worse yet he could not be deuled with Epic Deul. Hunt down would evolve to add cards such as ECC 4LOM to eliminate QGJ&#146;s immunity to atrition or added Maul to deul (using HD just to get the start of the D(irect) D(amage) machine ignoring the DD done to self) More sinister yet Crush the Rebellion was put into decks to Pull I Have You Now to pump up battle damage to encourage the opponent to forfit him. Hunt down had a nail in the coffin but there was an answer waiting in the wings... podracing.  HDADTJ was the perfect deck archetype for this new mechanic, and with Watto&#146;s box  Hunt down retrieved force lost early to Visage and heaped further force loss onto the opponent causing a 22 force swing! Coruscant released new Tuskin raiders to help dark side win pod racing vs racing intensive decks. Big D also released They Will be No Match for You, a card that allowed Maul to deul all those new jedi and not place HDADTJ/TFHGOITU out of play.   The Phantom Menace made this deck type worse by causing Maul to be immune to attrition, and We must Accelerate Our Plans pulls all those nasty podracing interupts making it difficult for LS to win the podrace while also allowing DS to pull effects from the reserve. <br>
<br>
	Much like Magic&#146;s red burn Hunt Down can thrive on low force generation. Hunt Down also has few characters. The deuling version runs 10 characters at most (usually 4 or 5 of them being Vader). They are usually higher deploy characters but since it interacts with the opponent in a limited fasion This archetype can deploy only one character a turn and still do well. HD&#146;s force generation total need just 6 force to survive 8 to do well. Five force is given in the start of the game worst case scenario a 1-1 battleground (usualy a DB) gives the 6 force needed. Any force given to you by your opponent is bonus and allows you to draw what you need. <br>
<br>
	Well that about covers the Red and Green aspects of magic. This article is already pretty long so I will close it for now and continue with Blue, White, and Black if there is a demand for them. LMK if you want this series to continue or not. On closing I would like to also like to point out that though I am focusing on just mono color decks. In Magic there are also multiple color combinations that combine some or all of the five color aspects. So it is with Star Wars. As we dig deeper into these concepts concider combining multiple concepts that lean towards the playing style you enjoy. Do not in any way feel that you should be locked into one specific deck type. Feel free to branch out and experiment. Who initialy thought that the DS Senate could lock down an opponent at first look of the cards, or that Brangus Glee could be a unique lockdown retrieval engine?  Also there is a five color, type one deck in Magic it is difficult to play and even more expensive to build but when played correclty will control the game and win almost every time. That is a far cry from simple burn. For a while, a well built Ral Ops did the same thing in SWCCG. We will take a look at Ral Ops next time.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2790"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2790"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2790" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
