Now, I know that some of them are from players that don&#146;t look at other people&#146;s decks and make their own from scratch.  But look at them.  You will definetely notice a similarity between the new decks and the great decks that have been on decktech.  The best example of this would be the incredible Dark Surgeon deck.  I&#146;ve really never seen such an example of well thought out strategy and card selections.  However, when the popularity of that deck peaked, more and more Black Sun decks were posted.  And what did they all have?  5 or more Emperor Palpatines.  What did most of them have?  Broken Concentration.  The list goes on and on, and if you look at them, you will notice only 3-4 card changes and relatively the same strategy.  This really bugs me.  Why can&#146;t people make their own decks?<br>
<br>
What are some pluses of making an original deck?  Well, for one, the surprise factor is always great.  However, the feeling you get of devising your own little plan and executing it is incredible.  For example, my friend once made a TDIGWATT deck using All Too Easy, I Have You Now, and The Emperor&#146;s Prize.  He set up The Emperor and Vader at the Carbonite Chamber, and you should know the rest of the story (I deploy Luke, he whacks me, I die, my lone Chewbacca gets killed by I Have You Now and You Overestimate Their Chances).  He felt great after that little trick, and it gave us something to talk about.<br>
<br>
Now I know that lots of people know about this trick (obviously I didn&#146;t) but it&#146;s just an example of doing something no one else does.  I never thought about it, cause I didn&#146;t buy much Cloud City, and it sure took me by surprise (he knew that, of course).  There are tons of examples where we have battled with our witty decks and made surprise after surprise that won tons of games.  I have won so many games by using the power of Weather Vane and Expand The Empire (check out Alucard&#146;s Stunningly Dark Deal).  No one will expect it, and it&#146;s extremely fun to do.  It wins games.  It&#146;s a great feeling to win without copying other peoples&#146; decks.<br>
<br>
Now, cookie cutter decks can be effective.  Sure, they&#146;ll win their share of games.  But how many will they win if the opponent knows exactly what you&#146;re doing?  If you play the same deck someone else plays, they&#146;ll know how to easy counter you and rock your world.  I&#146;ve seen it so many times, it amazes me.  I&#146;ve discovered so many strategies and combinations that at local tournaments, peole never know what I am doing and they always lose just because they can&#146;t figure out what I&#146;m thinking.  Of course, those people all play cookie-cutter decks, and I knew what to do to stop them.  <br>
<br>
Ahhh, the power of original decks.  I salute those who think about their decks and put in something no one else does.  Kudos to you!  Jeers to those who copy other decks!<br>
<br>
(Sorry for the semi-rant.  I just wanted people to know that originality is a good thing.  And now that school is out, I can make my Unsung Heroes Of SWCCG articles.  Hurray!  Also, check out all my decks.  Most of them are original and created through some creative thinking and observation.  Although, some do suck bad...)<br>
