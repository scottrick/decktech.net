This means that Jedi and Dark Jedi do not generate additional force and that their icons are replaced with that of alien icons. <br>
<br>
Clones deploy facing your opponent (upside down)and may deploy before or after the character they are cloning. <br>
<br>
Clones may not deploy, move, or be moved to the same site as another clone. If in some rare circumstance two identical (same persona) clones are together at the same site one is immediately lost (opponents choice). In addition the player controlling the clones also loses three force from the top of the reserve deck (cannot be reduced). <br>
<br>
Clones may not use unique character weapons (in example; A Darth Maul clone may not wield Maul’s Double-Bladed Lightsaber since he is not really Darth Maul. That character may still use a Dark Jedi Lightsaber though). <br>
<br>
If a clone contributes to a force drain at a planet site then that player may not activate any force at that site on their next turn. <br>
<br>
When a clone is Hit by an opponents non-clone character that opponent may retrieve three force. In addition that force may be taken directly into hand. <br>
<br>
All EPP, ECC, and EJP characters may not be used as clones. Specifically, any characters with a permanent weapon icon may not be used as clone characters. Droids may not be cloned. <br>
<br>
The following charaters are not legal for clone war rules when played with these objectives: <br>
<br>
Rescue The Princess. Leia may not be cloned while playing this objective. <br>
<br>
There Is Good In Him. Luke may not be cloned while playing this objective. <br>
<br>
Profit. Han may not be cloned while playing this objective. <br>
<br>
Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi. This deck warrants particular attention. Vader may be cloned, but his clones may not affect the objective card or Epic Duel. So clones may not use Epic duel and would place the objective out of play if they dueled. Also clones may not be targeted as Vader for purposes of game ballance by this objective. <br>
<br>
Bring Him Before Me. Vader may not be cloned while you play this objective. <br>
<br>
These decks were believed to be unbalanced by the clone wars rules. The main personas were key to the flip sides of these objectives and became abusive if cloned. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
