Introduction<br>
Death Star II has introduced many new strategies, and has changed the SW:CCG Tournament scene  more than any other expansion has. The biggest effect DSII made was in space. The expansion introduced new powerful starships, starfighters, pilots, and of course Admiral's Orders. And to go along with space, Decipher revived one of the long dead card types of SW:CCG- weapons.<br>
<br>
Weapons were always fairly unpopular (the exception being lightsabers and X-Wing Laser Cannons). But with several DSII cards and several fro other expansions, I think it's time for a change...<br>
<br>
II. The Weapons<br>
Now even though the Dark Side has there own powerful weapons, the Light Side has far greater and more poweful support cards and weapon enhancing cards.  Not to mention the large number of damage-inducing weapons.<br>
<br>
First off I'll go over the different starship weapons available to the Light Side, pointing out advantages and disadvantages to using each:<br>
<br>
---[A-wing Cannon: Destiny 4]---<br>
Text: Deploy on your A-wing. May target a starfighter or squadron for free. Draw destiny. Add your starship's maneuver. Target hit if total destiny &gt; twice target's defense value.<br>
<br>
-Alrighty, first of all, it's destiny 4, which ain't too shabby. Second, it can target a starfighter or squadron for free, which is great against TIE swarm, which I'm sure is going to be coming back in the coming weeks.	The best part about this weapon is that after you draw destiny, you add your starships maneuver!  Since it has to deploy on an A-Wing, that's 5 extra. Target hit if destiny greater than double target's defense value. Okay, so you want to hit a TIE Fighter. So you'd have to draw at least a 2 to hit it, which is better than the 3 that you would have to draw otherwise.<br>
[Weapon Rating (scale of 1-10): 8]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-Makes it easy to hit a regular TIE Fighters.<br>
-Fires for free.<br>
-Ability add your starships maneuver.<br>
-High destiny.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Can't fire at capitals (like you'd hit'em anyway)<br>
-Harder to hit the new Interceptors and other high-maneuver ships, which I'm sure will  be very popular.<br>
<br>
---[Concussion Missiles: Destiny 4]---<br>
Text: Use 1 Force to deploy on your bomber, A-wing, freighter or transport. May target a starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 1 if targeting a starfighter or squadron. Target hit if total destiny &gt; defense value.<br>
<br>
-Once again, another destiny of 4. And this weapon can not only deploy on your A-Wing, but your B-Wings, and Falcons, making it much more useful. Targets ANY starship for free. Nice. Add one to weapons destiny if targeting a starfighter, or squadron. Not bad. So using the regular TIE/ln as the example once again, you would have to draw at least a 3 to hit it, which isn't bad at all considering most cards in a deck (on average) are destiny 3. An all-around versatile weapon.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 9]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-Nice destiny.<br>
-Easy to hit regular TIE/lns.<br>
-Can deploy on more than one type of starship.<br>
-Adds one to destiny when firing at a starfighter/squadron.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Still hard to hit the higher-armor/maneuver ships.<br>
<br>
---[Enhanced Proton Torpedoes: Destiny 3]---<br>
Text: Deploy on your X-wing, Y-wing or B-wing. May target a starship for 1 Force. Add 1 if targeting a capital starship. Otherwise, subtract 1. Target hit if total destiny &gt; defense value.<br>
<br>
-Destiny 3. Still not bad. Can deploy on X-Wings, Y-Wings, and B-Wings, which makes this a nice universal weapon. Target a starship for 1 force. It's not free, but not many things in this galaxy are. Ahhhh, this weapon is more geared toward hitting capitals; add 1 if targeting a capital starship, otherwise subtract 1. Meaning your still gonna have to draw a six to hit a star destroyer, but it makes it that much easier.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 6]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-OK destiny.<br>
-Can deploy on three different starfighter types.<br>
-Easier to hit capitals.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Intruder Missiles are so much better.<br>
<br>
---[Intruder Missile: Destiny 7]---<br>
Text: Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-class freighter or Falcon. May target a capital starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 3 if that capital starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Target hit if total destiny &gt; defense value. After firing, place Missile in Used Pile.<br>
<br>
-Can't get much better at capital-ship pounding than this. Destiny of 7, you can't beat that. Can deploy on your B-Wings, YT-class freighters, Z-95s and the Falcon. Targets a capital starship FOR FREE. Add 3 to destiny if starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Uhhh...can you say awesome? After firing place missile in used pile. Can you say Weapon Levitation? Target a capital with an Intruder missile during a battle. Miss it. Fire at it with your next Intruder and blow it outta the sky.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 10]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-7 Destiny.<br>
-Fires for free.<br>
-Adds 3 to destiny if starship you firing at was targeted by another weapon this turn.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Can't fire at starfighters, but nothing's perfect.<br>
-Place it in used pile after firing. Not that bad, but it'd be nice if you didn't have to.<br>
<br>
---[Proton Torpedoes: Destiny 4]---<br>
Text: Use 1 Force to deploy on your X-wing, Y-wing or B-wing. May target a starship using 1 Force. Draw destiny. Target hit if destiny &gt; defense value.<br>
<br>
-Same as Enhanced Torps basically. Higher destiny, but doesn't add one when firing at a capital ship. Doesn't subtarct one for not.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 6]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-Doesn't subtract 1 from destiny when firing at a starfighter.<br>
-Higher destiny than enhanced.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Intruder Missiles are still better.<br>
<br>
---[SW-4 Ion Cannon: Destiny 5]---<br>
Text: Use 1 Force to deploy on your Y-wing or B-wing. May target a starship using 1 Force. Draw destiny. If destiny &gt; target's defense value, all starship weapons deployed on target are lost, armor or maneuver=0 and hyperspeed=0.<br>
<br>
-This is a really underrated weapon, especially now that DSII is out. This thing can basically make any starship easy picking for another of your weapons in a battle. Now it can only deploy on a Y-Wing or B-Wing. It takes one force to fire. And you don't get any built in destiny adder. BUT if you do manage to hit a ship, you can basically call it dead.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 7]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-Drops a starships maneuver/armor to 0 easily (Can trap a starship at a system and  apply beatdown).<br>
-Good destiny.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Can be hard to hit a starship.<br>
<br>
---[X-wing Laser Cannon: Destiny 5]---<br>
Text: Deploy on your X-wing. May target a starfighter using X Force, where X = 0 to 3. Draw destiny. If destiny + X &gt; defense value, target hit (lost instead if X = 3).<br>
<br>
-The best starfighter screen. Use 3 force to target a starfighter. add 3 to destiny. Hit it. It's lost. Simple isn't it? The only problem is actually having to pay 3 force if you wqnt to kill off a starfighter immediaty.<br>
[Weapon Rating: 10]<br>
[Props:]<br>
-Everything.<br>
[Slops:]<br>
-Having to pay 3 force to kill a ship immediatly.<br>
-Can't shoot at capital ships.<br>
<br>
III. Support Cards<br>
The best part about Light Side starship weapons is the awesome support provided by the interrupts and effects that enhance and support your weapon usage. That's why I chose Light starship weapons over Dark starship weapons, o even Light character weapons. Rebel starship weapons are just so powerful when used correctly.<br>
<br>
Here's a list I compiled of all the possible support cards and weapon enhancers:<br>
<br>
[Combined Attack: Destiny 4]<br>
Text: During a battle, target opponent's starship present with two (or more) of your starship weapons. Add all weapon destiny draws together. Apply that total separately for each weapon.<br>
<br>
-This card basically allows you to combine all of your weapon destinies to take out one starship. Take out the Executor? No problem.<br>
<br>
[Hit And Run: Destiny 3]<br>
Text: Just after the weapons phase of a battle, you may move any of all of your starships there away, at normal use of the Force. ('Hit' cards must still be lost.)<br>
<br>
-This card was made to serve starfighter decks that utilize weapons. Initiate a battle. Fire your weapons, take out a star destroyer, run away. Classic Light Side...<br>
<br>
[Power Pivot: Destiny 4]<br>
Text: If your piloted starship armed with a starship weapon is in battle, lose 1 Force to reduce the power of one opponent's starship in that battle to zero. OR Place one opponent's starship just 'hit' in Lost Pile.<br>
<br>
-Hmm...reduce any starships power to 0 in a battle? Not bad at all. Hit any starship with a weapon, they're lost. Not to bad at all.<br>
<br>
[Precise Hit: Destiny 2]<br>
Text: USED: During a battle at a system or sector, instead of firing one of your starship weapons at a target, reduce that target's power by 4 until end of turn. LOST: During a battle at a system or sector, use 3 Force to cancel one battle destiny just drawn.<br>
<br>
-Power Pivot reduces a starship's power to zero for a battle. BUT it's a lost interrupt. Precise Hit let's you reduce an opponent's starship by 4 for the remainder of the turn, and it's used. This card is better for regular star destroyers and other lower-powered starships. Power Pivot is basically anit-Executor. Precise Hit also allows you to cancel a battle destiny. Gotta love it.<br>
<br>
[Stay Sharp!: Destiny 4]<br>
Text: During your control phase, fire one of your starship weapons (for free). If Han or any gunner is aboard that starship, may add 2 to destiny draw. 'Hit' target is lost. OR If you just fired a weapon in battle, add that weapon's destiny number to your total power.<br>
<br>
-Fire a starship weapon for free. Hit target's immediatly lost. Fire a weapon in battle, add it's destiny to your power total. Cool.<br>
<br>
[Steady Aim: Destiny 3]<br>
Text: Add X to one starship weapon destiny (before destiny is drawn) when targeting opponent's starship. USED: X = 2. LOST: X = 4.<br>
<br>
-This card basically allows you to hit just about anything. Universal.<br>
<br>
[Weapon Levitation: Destiny 4]<br>
Text: USED: Search your Used Pile, take one weapon into hand and reshuffle. LOST: Cancel You Are Beaten. OR If a battle was just initiated, one of your characters of ability &gt; 3 present may steal one character weapon present.<br>
<br>
-This card is good to grab weapons as quick as possible. It also has some other uses...<br>
<br>
[Aim High: Destiny 5]<br>
Text: Deploy on table. When you fire two weapons (except lightsabers) in a battle, your total power is +5. Also, whenever opponent retrieves X cards, opponent must first use X Force or that retrieval is canceled. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
-Fire two weapons, add 5 to your power. Also the Light Side variant of Secret Plans<br>
<br>
[Slayn &amp; Korpil Facilities: Destiny 4]<br>
Text: Deploy on Roche system. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy a starship weapon from Reserve Deck on your B-wing| reshuffle. Also, retrieve 2 Force whenever your starfighter or vehicle 'hits' an opponent's starship or vehicle. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
-Pull weapons outta your reserve real quick like, as well as retrieve a little ater you blow some ships away.<br>
<br>
[Superficial Damage: Destiny 5]<br>
Text: Deploy on table. Each turn, each of your characters, vehicles, and starships may forfeit one of its weapons (except a lightsaber) using forfeit value = 3. Also, your forfeited weapons go to Used Pile. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
-Awesome, awesome card. No need to forfiet those X-Wings, I'll just forfiet their weapons! And instead of losing them, I'll put them in my used pile! Sweet.<br>
<br>
[Weapons Display: Destiny 3]<br>
Text: Deploy on your side of table. Each of your starships with two or more starship weapons aboard is power +2. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may use 2 Force to deploy from Lost Pile one starship weapon, vehicle weapon or artillery weapon (for free).<br>
<br>
-Grab weapons from lost pile, and all of your starships with two or more starship weapons aboard is power +2. Excellent...<br>
<br>
[Concentrate All Fire (Admiral's Orders): Destiny 6]<br>
Text: Each starfighter that fires a weapon in battle is power +3 for the remainder of battle. Once per turn you may cancel and redraw your starship weapon destiny just drawn. At sites related to systems you occupy, your characters who have immunity to attrition each add 2 to immunity and 1 to each of that character's weapon destiny draws.<br>
<br>
-If you can't see why this card fits in with the group, I suggest you go signup for a catscan...<br>
<br>
That's about it for support cards. I just basically chose the most effective cards, and the cards that would fit best in a deck type based around starship weapons.<br>
<br>
IV. Combos<br>
Here's the fun part. Using these cards one at a time helps, but not as much as using them together...<br>
<br>
Superficial Damage + Weapon Levitation = Forfiet X-Wing Laser Cannon to used pile. Play Weapon Levitation and pull it back to your hand.<br>
<br>
Hit And Run + Combined Attack= Initiate a battle. Blow away a Star Destroyer. Run away.<br>
<br>
Intruder Missile + Weapon Levitation= Fire an Intruder Missile. Send Intruder Missile to used pile. Get Intruder Missile back.<br>
<br>
Aim High + Weapons Display + Stay Sharp! + Power Pivot + Precise Hit + Concentrate All fire= Beatdown, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
Draw Their Fire + Slayn &amp; Korpil= Now I didn't put DTF in the list above, but when combined with S&amp;K you can retrieve up to 3 force a battle. Just a thought.<br>
<br>
Now believe me, I know there are more combos to be utilized with these cards, but these are just the main ones. It's up to you to figure out the rest (I'm not doing all the work).<br>
<br>
V. Making It Work<br>
Now there are many ways to make a deck based on those cards, but it'd be impossible to fit them all into your deck. Put in what you'll need to fit your local meta. There are many starships to pick from as well. Personally i think this deck would work best with the unique pilots and ships from DSII in unison with Squadron Assignments. The cool thing about this deck is that most of the weapons/support cards are high destiny, making it very easy to hit an opponent's starship so you don't have concentrate as much on putting in high destinied; they come automatically. DSII offers a lot of new strategies and this is just one of many. I probably missed a lot of things that I could have mentioned, but I'm only one man (at least that's what the voices in my head tell me, the psyciatrists say otherwise...). Good luck, and good deck building!<br>
