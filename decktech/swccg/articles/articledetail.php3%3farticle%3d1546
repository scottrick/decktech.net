Destiny 5<br>
Attack plans for General Madine's commandos often require coordinated air support. A number of Z-95 headhunters have been modified to operate in this role.<br>
EFFECT<br>
Deploy on table. While your Z-95 occupies a system or cloud sector, once per turn your scout at a related exterior site may add one battle destiny (if Z-95 is Tala 1 or Tala 2, may also add one destiny to total power only).<br>
<br>
Air power wins battles. It happens in real life and it happens in Star Wars. Death Star 2 has given the idea of complimenting ground forces and air forces into usable strategies through Admirals Orders. DS2 also sees a stride in giving ground-striking air power a large boost, as seen through new ships and characters that help TIE Bombers and Bombing Run. For the light side, there is Close Air Support.<br>
<br>
All Close Air Support does is give the Rebels the ability to call down the fire from above and provide an air strike for their scouts. It utilizes Z-95 headhunters, starfighters with space capabilities but more proficient in the atmosphere of planets, Clouds. The benefits help when using scouts at exterior sites, and we all know the scouts that are predominatly on Decipher's minds: Endor scouts. But there are many other strategies and deck ideas that Close Air Support can help out.<br>
<br>
So let's take each element and check out how this card can help.<br>
<br>
Z-95 HEADHUNTERS<br>
Z-95s are like the bastard children of the regular starfighters for the LS. They are there, they have some good things about them, but they have no real use. As of DS2, there are only four Z-95s you can choose from:<br>
<br>
Z-95 Headhunter<br>
Destiny 3<br>
Developed by Incom/Subpro. Atmospheric fighter adapted for space travel. AF-4 version refitted wth Incom 2a fission engines and two Taim &amp; Bak KX5 laser cannons.<br>
STARFIGHTER: Z-95 HEADHUNTER<br>
Power 2  Maneuver 4  No Hyperdrive<br>
Deploy 2  Forfiet 2<br>
Independent Starship  Perm. Pilot<br>
Permanent pilot aboard provides ability of 1. Power and maneuver +2 at non-unique cloud sectors. May be carried aboard starships like a vehicle.<br>
<br>
The first headhunter to come about in the game was lacking, but with the advent of LS big blue, carrying a ship like a vehicle helps a whole lot. Alright, deploy is low, but so is the forfiet. Power is average and it has a good maneuver. No hyperdrive makes it only good with capitals around to tote it from place to place, sitting at a planet system, or flying the clouds. This headhunter has regular power and manuever in non-unique clouds (the game text offsets the cloud game text). And it's an independent starship. Meaning: it can't be targeted by Tallon Roll, and it has immunity to attrition when using Quiet Mining Colony.<br>
<br>
***Z-95 Bespin Defense Fighter<br>
Destiny 2<br>
Used to combat pirate activity in and around Cloud City. Top speed in atmosphere 1,150 kph. Hyperdrive installed by Bespin Motors.<br>
STARFIGHTER: MODIFIED Z-95 HEADHUNTER<br>
Power 2  Maneuver 4  Hyperspeed 2<br>
Deploy 2  Forfiet 3<br>
Independent Starship  Perm. Pilot  Astromech  Scomp Link<br>
Permanent pilot provides ability of 1 and adds 1 to power. May add one alien pilot (suspends permanent pilot). Power +2 at Bespin locations. May be carried aboard starships like a vehicle.<br>
<br>
The headhunter made to help out said Quiet Mining Colony. Again, it's independent, so no Tallon Rolls and it's immune to attrtion with a flipped QMC. It has extra power with the permanent pilot and extra power at Bespin locations, but not in the clouds. This guy is made to sit at Bespin: Cloud City and fend everything off. Deploys for 2 and gets a power of 5. It's also the first headhunter with hyperspeed, so it can go to the planet systems and help out. Downside: it's 3-dot unique, so only three of these fine ships can ever be helping you out.<br>
<br>
*Tala 1<br>
Destiny 3<br>
Heavily modified Headhunter. Operationally assigned to support Madine's commando team. Hyperdrive added to allow it to operate independently of capital starship support.<br>
STARFIGHTER: MODIFIED Z-95 HEADHUNTER<br>
Power 2  Maneuver 4  Hyperspeed 3<br>
Deploy 2  Forfiet 3<br>
Astromech  Scomp Link<br>
May add 1 pilot. May be carried like a vehicle. Power and maneuver +2 at opponent's system (except battlegrounds) or at any sector. Immune to attrition&lt;4 when Colonel Cracken piloting.<br>
<br>
The Tala Headhunters have a better hyperspeed than the preceeding z-95s, but have disadvantages as well. They are not independent, so they are able to be hit by a Tallon Roll. You gotta have a pilot to use it, too. It does, however, have the power and maneuver bonus in clouds and sectors, which now include Death Star 2 sectors. The real plus is dropping this ship with its matching pilot...<br>
<br>
*Colonel Cracken<br>
Destiny 2<br>
Alliance spy and scout. Often flies support missions for General Madine's commandos.<br>
Power 3  Ablity 2<br>
Deploy 3  Forfiet 4  P	W<br>
Deploys -2 aboard Tala 1. Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots. When piloting Tala 1, draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. When opponent deploys a spy or scout to same (or related) exterior site, opponent loses 1 force.<br>
<br>
So with Cracken in Tala 1, you have a power 4, immune&lt;4, destiny drawing ship that is not impared by cloud power and maneuver subtractions and can deploy ANYWHERE for 3 force. He can sit in a cloud sector and hold it off on his own.<br>
<br>
*Tala 2<br>
Destiny 2<br>
Equipped with sophisticated sensor suite to monitor Imperial activity during Rebel commando operations. Hyperdrive allows long-range reconaissance.<br>
STARFIGHTER: MODIFIED Z-95 HEADHUNTER<br>
Power 2  Maneuver 4  Hyperspeed 3<br>
Deploy 1  Forfiet 3<br>
Astromech  Scomp Link<br>
May add 1 pilot. May be carried like a vehicle. When your spy aboard, opponent's spies and scouts are deploy +2 to related sites. Immune to attrition&lt;4 when Lieutenant Blount piloting.<br>
<br>
Tala 2 helps out Tala 1, but the uniqueness of the ship lies in the scout/spy deploy cost increase. It helps to protect the force on the ground for the Close Air Support attack from incoming Endor imperials (and Mada Jade). It deploys for less but it doesn't have the same power/maneuver bonus like Tala 1, so it's going to be power/maneuver -2 in the clouds. But you have to add into account the matching pilot..<br>
<br>
*Lieutenant Blount<br>
Destiny 2<br>
Wingman of Colonel Cracken. Spy and scout. Former agent of the Imperial Security Bureau. Defected and joined Rebel intelligence. Seasoned combat veteran.<br>
Power 2  Ability 2<br>
Deploy 2  Forfiet 4  P	W<br>
Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots. When piloting Tala 2, draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. While he occupies any Coruscant location, Empire's Sinister Agents is flipped and ISB Operations may not be flipped.<br>
<br>
He allows the Tala 2 to get a destiny draw alone, hold the immunity to attrition, and still deploy for 3 force ANYWHERE. Granted, he's not the cream of the crop for the clouds like Cracken in Tala 1, but teamed up with him he is as effective. Getting a power of 6 in the clouds without using cloud cars is a feat. Only the Z-95s and the Obsidian class TIEs can do that. If the opponent isn't packing Obsidians, then you can pretty much rule the clouds with no contest.<br>
<br>
OCCUPY A SYSTEM OR CLOUD SECTOR<br>
<br>
The only real way that any Z-95 is going to occupy a system is if they have some heavy-assed backup hitting the brunt of the Imperial Navy's attack. Even then, they have to contend with all the wonderful new TIEs and the weapons they possess. Z-95s have the advantage in the clouds, so take to the clouds. All the starship interrupts that work in systems, like Corellian Slip, Hyper Escape, A Few Maneuvers, or Out Of Nowhere (it works! extra destiny!) work in clouds. So now you can have the battles like you would at the systems in clouds with extra benefits. No star destroyers are going to smack down your Z-95s in the clouds, only starfighters and Bossk in Hound's Tooth. All those starfighters and ships that go in have hindered power and maneuver, which means they have to pump up their presence or use some good matching pilots and ships to meet you head to head. If Z-95s could use good weapons that can fire at starfighters, they could have a field day.<br>
<br>
Cloud City is the best example. Along with using Talas, the Z-95 Defense fighters also solidify your atmosphere presence even more. Quiet Mining Colony relies on the defense of Bespin: Cloud City and the clouds to increase unmodifiable force drains. Cloud City is a sector. So as long as one of your pumped up Defense Fighters is hanging out at Cloud City, you can help out the ground forces gambling at the casino or brawling in the port town district.<br>
<br>
Occupying a planet system often times does squat. Controlling a cloud sector adds to the force drains on the planet below. It's no contest.<br>
<br>
SCOUT AT EXTERIOR SITE<br>
<br>
Cloud City may have the cloud control for the first part of the effect, but there's no other place that screams scouts and exterior sites like Endor. A majority of the scouts that the Rebels have at their disposal deploy for less or have added benefits on Endor. Every major player for the Light Side is now a scout and deploy less to Endor. There are non-unique scouts for Endor. All the Rebel scrubs from Endor and some from DS2 are scouts that have no other use than on Endor.<br>
<br>
Although, they are not the only scouts. Ralltiir Frighter Captains are also scouts. They can ride speeder bikes and replace the permanent pilot in Z-95 defense fighters. They are also non-unique, can cancel force drains with Bargaining Table, and increase force drains with Tessek in the Audience Chamber. Snivvians are also scouts. They are power 3 during nighttime conditions and deploy as a react. Arconas are also scouts. Remember back in Hoth? There are Rebel Scouts in there, too. All those non-unique scout aliens, when used with a flipped QMC, are immune to attrition along with the Z-95s (except Talas) that you have protecting the skies. There are a good amount of exterior sites on Cloud City, like the Downtown Plaza, Casino, Docking Bay and others that can get extra cover from Air Support.<br>
<br>
Heck, if you feel adventurous, drop Nightfall on Tatooine, put down a 2X and Snivvians, and a couple Z-95s in a couple cloud sectors. Force drain for a good amount and battle for a whole lot more.<br>
<br>
ADD ONE BATTLE DESTINY<br>
<br>
So the ultimate end result is an extra battle destiny. 'Nuff said. When using the Talas, you get another destiny tacked on to your power. Depending on your deck, it could make a swift turn in the game by defeating your opponent using this effect. In the Tatooine example above, image having two battle destinies, then adding two more destinies to your total power. If you track your cards right, you can knock out everyone at that battle.<br>
<br>
CLOSE AIR SUPPORT IS NOT PERFECT<br>
<br>
It is not the end all solution of the Rebel Strike Team/Quiet Mining Colony Problem.<br>
<br>
--It can be Altered.<br>
Unless you have a good retrieval system or pack two your deck (if it's that important to you), it will most likely get Altered quickly, probably because it will be one of the few effects on the table that can be Altered. Packing SAC protection will do nicely to help this out. Also, deploy it when you have the opportunity to use it to the fullest advantage. When you have the Z-95 in the clouds or system, and you are just about to battle, then get it out. If it lingers around too long, it will get Altered.<br>
<br>
--Starships weapons will kill your Z-95s.<br>
It's too easy. These ships can't fire any weapons that hit starfighters, only Intruder Missles. They are maneuver 4, but since they are starfighters, the SFS cannons can pretty much kill each Z-95 that pops its head out of the clouds. Baron Soontir Fel and Saber 1 needs over a 1  for weapon destiny if using SFS cannons to hit a Z-95. Not much you can do about it besides running away, A Few Maneuvers, or adding a sitting duck ship with a starship weapon in there as backup.<br>
<br>
--Battle Deployment.<br>
The Admiral's Order for the DS that makes sure that you draw only one battle destiny. Like all Admiral's Orders, it can be sent off the table when a new AO in played. It can hamper, and it's not that large of a problem, but when it's played, Close Air Support does nothing.<br>
<br>
--Cloud Cars.<br>
They will eat you alive and come back for seconds. Nothing rules clouds like cloud cars.<br>
<br>
--Bounty Hunter ships.<br>
Although their power poses little threat, they can knock out the ships with their abilities and immunity. Boba in Slave 1 is on equal par with both Talas. Dengar kills their immunity. Zuckuss eliminates their battle destiny. IG and Bossk give extra destiny to knock them out. It's a damn shame that Z-95 can't blow them out of the sky, all except Bossk with an Intruder Missle.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
<br>
Close Air Support is not the god card that everyone needs in their deck, and yet it shouldn't only be used as a coaster. For a common card, it has good advantages that can milk positive results when used well. It also compliments other strategies well and, look out, it can fool your opponent (Why the heck would he use that stupid card?) and it might help you, gasp, win the game (Where'd that extra destiny come from?).<br>
<br>
Suggested strategies:<br>
Rebel Strike Team (non-bunker), Rebel Strike Team (bunker): scouts at exterior sites need all the help they can muster.<br>
<br>
There Is Good In Him: add clouds for extra force drain in clouds and on ground, and add a destiny wherever Luke is playing on Endor.<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony: using alien scouts and non-Rebel Z-95s, force drain o rama, get your immunity on, and drop chronic battle destinies on the DS.<br>
<br>
Profit w/Tessek (non-unique alien scouts): on Tatooine or wherever, extra force drain damage and more power on the ground help to make often-killed aliens survive. Add nightfall and nightfall aliens (Talz, Snivvian, Arcona) for solid ground power and added destinies to power.<br>
