<br>
This is something you must do before States, obviously. However, there is a right way to playtest, and there is a wrong way. I chose the wrong way to playtest for states, and it showed. I playtested by playing a few games with my friends, probably around 10-12 in the week leading up to states. I never really got to test against many of the popular deck types, and so I was severely under prepared. When you playtest, you must formulate a list of the popular decktypes, and you must play your decks against these deck types at least 2-3 times. In addition to playing all of these decktypes, you must devise a strategy on how you are going to play against these decks come game time. This was another fatal mistake I made, since I played sort of aimlessly in the 2 games that I lost at States. Here is a list of decks that you MUST playtest against:<br>
<br>
<br>
LIGHT:<br>
<br>
WYS Palace Raiders<br>
HB Mains<br>
EBO X-Wings<br>
EBO Deadbolt<br>
TIGIH Scouts<br>
<br>
If you want a strategy on less popular decks, I will write it on request&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
<br>
	Now the question remains: What cards help to prepare against these strategies?<br>
<br>
WYS Palace Raiders:<br>
<br>
In preparing for this deck type, you have to be aware that your activation at non-bg locations is going to be limited to 1 when they flip, and with Raiders, they usually flip fast. They key to winning this game is to limit their drains on Tatooine, limit their battle destiny, and limit their retrieval. The best way to limit their drains can be achieved in a variety of ways:<br>
<br>
1. Replace their AO, I&amp;#8217;ll take The Leader, to limit their DB Drains.<br>
2. Take control of the cantina.<br>
3. Flip either operatives (Risky), or flip ISB (preferable)<br>
<br>
To limit their battle destiny, you have 3 solid options:<br>
<br>
1. AO &amp;#8211; Battle Deployment (Limits destiny to 1)<br>
2. Imperial Command<br>
3. Guri<br>
<br>
I recommend playing Guri in EVERY deck except for maybe TIE&amp;#8217;s. Once she is down, wave bye bye to their massive destiny, just make sure that you protect her from weapons and attrition with a walker, executor, or chimaera. I prefer to pull Executor with Mob. Points and get Thrawn down for Imperial Command until Guri comes down. To deal with Dash Rendar, I like Lateral Damage, others like I Had No Choice, either works.<br>
<br>
To limit retrieval, you have 3 solid options:<br>
<br>
1. Grabbers<br>
2. Something Special Planned For Them<br>
3. Secret Plans<br>
 <br>
I recommend playing Grabbers in EVERY deck, because even when they aren&amp;#8217;t grabbing On The Edge&amp;#8217;s, Off The Edge&amp;#8217;s, and Harvests, they are snagging abusive cards like Fallen Portal and Rebel Barrier. Secret Plans is another must add. If you really fear retrieval, go all out and add in SSPFT. <br>
 <br>
HB Mains : <br>
<br>
In order to beat HB Mains, you must limit their retrieval, take Menace Fades/Battle Plan out of the game, and prevent beatdowns.<br>
<br>
In order to limit retrieval, refer to the above strategy in WYS. I believe that when you eliminate Menace Fades and Battle Plan from the game, HB Mains cannot win. To do this, you must eliminate the super falcon, as it it is the force that drives every HB Mains deck&amp;#8217;s space fleet. To do this you must limit the insane battle destiny draws, or draw high enough destiny to take the whole ship out at once. MKOS is perfect for drawing high destiny, as is Imperial Command. In fact, I have observed that Imperial Command is the bane of most light decks right now, so this should already be in your deck. The TIE Cannon is another way to take down the Super Falcon, instantly. Another version of HB Mains revolves around 1 turn beatdowns with crazy amounts of destiny adders; I believe this version to be pathetically easy to beat. If you are playing MKOS, play None Shall Pass, or pile everyone up in the AC. If you are playing TIE&amp;#8217;s, use Operational As Planned and Ghyyk, then shoot the falcon with a gun the next turn. If you are playing Hunt Down, do not deploy to space, instead, start Crush The Rebellion and drain at CC:Docking Bay and D*:Docking Bay. If you are playing ISB Space, again, Operational As Planned and follow it up with Imperial Command or Ghyyyk. Obviously, Operational as Planned is huge in this matchup. Against a version that uses beggar instead of Frozen Assets, Crush the Rebellion is the only option, but nobody plays Beggar in that deck so no worries.<br>
<br>
EBO X-wings/EBO Deadbolt<br>
<br>
EBO X-wings starts the game off pretty fast, and they will usually flip around 2 turn, 3 turn at the latest. The key to winning this matchup is to avoid the beatdown in space, and limit their drains. The best way to go about this is to invade Hoth with walkers and setup Imperial Decree. If you cannot find the room for walkers, then do not invade Hoth with characters because there is about a 99% chance that your guys are going to get Ice Stormed. So then you have to turn to option 2, extremely fast, early damage. On the first few turns, an EBO deck will be focused on flipping, and flipping alone. Take advantage of this and cause as much damage as possible in the first couple of turns through Search and Destroy, Drains, and Visage if you are playing Hunt Down. If you are play MKOS, and you start No Bargain as most do, pull Gallid from your reserve deck furst turn, or Mosep. If you can knock off an Echo Site, EBO cannot win. Resistance is another good card to cap off the drains of EBO, as well as Battle Order to slow them down. Do not deploy to space prematurely as you will get smacked around by hoards of x-wings, I don&amp;#8217;t recommend going to space unless it is absolutely necessary. Against the Ketwol (Deadbolt) version of EBO, you have to expect EPP swarms. The advantage you will have in this matchup is knowing that they have a weak space fleet with only the Tala Boys and maybe a few unique x-wings. Take control of your site&amp;#8217;s, and reinforce them to the point that your opponent will not want to come to you. Space should be a cinch with the Chimaera, Thrawn, and Zuckuss. Since I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned it yet, I recommend playing Chimaera, Thrawn, and Imperial Command in every deck except Numbers, or some TIE decks. <br>
<br>
TIGIH Scouts<br>
<br>
I have never found this deck to be very hard to beat, but it seems that it is growing in popularity, so it needs a strategy to be beaten. The bane of this deck is Captain Sarkli, so I recommend putting him in your Hunt Down, BHBM, and ISB decks. He is a spy, so he can deploy to chirpa&amp;#8217;s hut first turn, and he cancels acvtivation at non-bg&amp;#8217;s where he is present, so he basically screws TIGIH by letting them activate 2 on their next turn. But unless you want to pack sarkli x59, you are not going to draw him every game, so the best strategy is too get someone down to Endor: Docking Bay first turn every game. This will limit their activation as well, and force luke to come out of his hut. You have to abuse the huge force jump you get, so that means you an deploy fairly early without fear of beatdowns. The best way to deal with your opponent once he gets going is to take out his key scouts and prevent them from ever battling. To do this, you must play exclusion cards, like the following:<br>
<br>
Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith<br>
IG-88 with Riot Gun<br>
Trample<br>
Force Lightning<br>
Sniper/Dark Strike<br>
<br>
And many, many more&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
Be aware that once your opponent wins a few battles, he can duel you and instantly win. So never battle unless you know that you are going to win. If you are playing scum, do not give Luke to Mara, and set up your drains ASAP. You will be able to outdrain him in the palace.<br>
<br>
So there you have it, a strategy guide to beat the light side right now. Depending on the response of this article, I will write a strategy against Dark Decks.<br>
