At local tournaments in the tatooine i have noticed an increase in &quot;sleight of hand&quot; or cheating. I am not blaming the tournament directors for this i am blaming the cheaters. When it first happened to me i didn&#146;t know whatr to do about it, i talked to the player, he denied it and i let it slide watching carefully for the rest of the game. The kid took first place at the tournement and that made me angry. I asked the tournament director later how to deal with cheaters and he said that no matter what if you suspect someone of cheating call over the tournament director and explain the situation. You can even ask the director to watch the rest of the game. Don&#146;t let any player intimadate you, call him on it. Cheaters are a black stain on the good name of the game. But there is also another side to this story, don&#146;t go overboard and accuse anyone for anything. If they make a mistake it&#146;s not cheating explain to them the rules do not try and get them disqualifed. If you are a cheater and are reading this be warned i will not stand for it and i hope nobody else will. To win a game by cheating is not truly winning, the second you cheat you are admitting defeat to your opponet, you are saying &quot;i cannot win but want to so i better cheat&quot;. This ruins the game for all players. Who wants to pay 5$ to play at a tournament and get low prize support when a cheater walks off with first place. I&#146;m urging all players to be aware of this issue and to help put a stop to cheating permanately. If enough people lose interest in the game because they lose to cheaters, players as a whole will suffer and if enough quit the game will end. Thank you for taking the time to read this article i hope you learned something and will now be more aware of everything. Don&#146;t let the actions of a few ruin the game for all. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
