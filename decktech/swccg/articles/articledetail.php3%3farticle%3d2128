However, as they say, before you come in with the new, you have to go out with the old.  Bullet cards are those that have functions that will just about eliminate other cards or deck types.  No deck type can truly ever be eliminated, but it can be seriously hindered or slowed by a certain card.  In this article, I am trying to help newbies, who come across certain cards and cant stop them, figure out how to get around them.  I can never list all the bullet cards, but I have pulled some of the finer examples from the different expansions.<br>
<br>
Premier<br>
Blast Door Controls- I can honestly say that this card is in ninety percent of my decks.  With the coming of more popular defensive decks, this card is even more useful.  I would have to say that the biggest benefit is the anti-barrier you get.  Even the best of players can probably recall a loss to a getting stopped by rebel barrier and being beatdown the next turn.  It is a sad thing to happen, but that is reason for the card.  This will stop that card altogether.  Narrow Escape and Blast the Door Kid have seen some more play in decks like Profit and Rescue the princess but that is about it.  Some people like to block drains and move away with Narrow but this will cancel that little trick too.<br>
Sense, Alter- Probably the best bullet cards in the game.  Decipher knew that interrupts and effects would be really powerful if they could not be stopped so they made these cards to help stop them.  Though they are not an auto cancellation they will slow down your opponent most of the time.  Sense and Alter saw it&amp;#8217;s glory days in the time of Bring Him Before Me and a Light Side Mains deck.  I just want to say one thing about these too.  SAC will never die!!!!  Even with the R2 combo cards, people will still be playing SAC until the day this great game ends.<br>
It Could Be Worse- Early on Decipher saw how much the light side can be losing in their strategies as compared to the Dark Side strategies.  This card will need to be played in multiples to help get them.  Use them to bullet heavy losses and to save you a large amount of cards at a time.  Slow decks like Mind What You Have Learned really flourish with this card, since it leaves you away from having to suffer huge losses at a time.<br>
Overload- Do not mock this card. It is still a good card in todays arenas.  When playing with bounty hunters in ships X-Wing Cannons will kill you quicker then anything.  Some light side weapons still see some play and I can guarantee you if they do, they will serve a good purpose.  This card will bullet weapons with some tracking.  Just track, draw and rid your self of the cards that have the potential to beat you down.<br>
<br>
A New Hope<br>
Oo-ta Goo-ta, Solo?- During this time, one of the most popular interrupts in the game was Nabrun Leids.  You can transport a force for nothing and beat down one someone.  This card targeted that ability and canceled it, making the light side think twice about trying this.  Also, since the dawn of Star Wars CCG time, people have been Kessel Running.  It has always been there, and with the new objective, it probably will always be there.  <br>
<br>
Hoth<br>
I honestly don&amp;#8217;t play with really any Hoth cards at all just about.  Echo Base Operations is a sweet deck, but the Hoth expansion really didn&amp;#8217;t seem to bullet any deck type in my honest opinion.<br>
<br>
Dagobah<br>
There Is No Try/Do or Do Not- Finally a way to stop Sense and Alter is coming.  With control out, no one was going to play Sense and Alter after Dagobah it seemed.  The opposing side had to lose two force and the S and A was lost.  This totally kills the idea of playing S and A.  While it has made comebacks, the new combo of these and Wise Advise/Oppressive Enforcement, SAC has seen the glory days.  This card alone almost bulleted SA out of the seen but SA still find their ways back into decks.<br>
Control- This is the main bullet card that came out of Dagobah.  It has some extremely different qualities that make is an all around great card.  With the new combo cards, you will see even more of them these days.  Control can first off cancel Sense and Alter.  It bulleted these cards and slows down anyone playing with heavy Sense and Alters.  This is great alone.  Then it will also cancel specialized effects like Utinni effects and such.  This does not apply to too many decks but knowing you can do it is pretty sweet.  This also helped bullet large drain decks.  With the loss of one force you can cancel a drain of three or four, depending on what effects the opponent has out.  Control will be in most decks these days, I predict and should be since it stops and slows many strategies. <br>
Great Warrior- Up to this point the dark side was not getting too many modifiers out but in today&amp;#8217;s games, jedi test one can be key to winning games.  The only way to stop it is to kill the apprentice, so this is a bullet card that is nearly impossible to stop.  Lots of decks go testing and only test to one or to three just to get this main ability on the table, and to make sure it stays.<br>
Transmission Terminated- Without Visage of the Emperor, Hunt Down has lost much of its greatness.  This cards bullets Visage and takes it off the board where it cannot hurt you.  Most good players pack at least two TTs in a deck to help out to bullet the Visage.  With the new combo card, it is just stupid in my opinion not to carry at least one, if not two or three.  Transmission Terminated solved a problem before it really ever because a huge one.  Now people are loving this card and praising that it is here to save slow decks.<br>
<br>
Cloud City<br>
Imperial Decree- Probably the most hated bullet card of all time is Imperial Decree.  This card was put out in large part to slow the growth of the popular EBO decks.  EBO is still a huge deck type today, but just about every dark side deck that can have presence in both arena&amp;#8217;s will pack this card to slow the hurt of EBO.  Cancels all the bonuses also hurts ground decks, such as a Tessek alien swarm deck.  Decree will always be in the game and will hurt many future decks to come too.  I want to write pages on how good this card can be but there is not much more to say.<br>
Point Man- I have heard scrub players laugh at great players and me because we pack Point Man.  Many good players might think this is unnecessary but Point Man is a great bullet card.  The main use for this card is to cancel the dreaded Order to Engage we see in most good Mains decks these days.  Order to Engage is such a great cards because if you run, or just not battle because the field is even, you will lose three force.  This really adds up against a dark side player playing a manipulation deck that just holds sites, and not actually try to have power there.  I still see people packing Scramble in their decks to slow down some dark side decks and that can really hurt, but if you are packing Point Man, you will get it.  The only other card that Point Man bullets that I see occasionally is Asteroid Sanctuary, but you do not see many of those deck in sanctioned arenas.<br>
<br>
Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace<br>
Resistance- I use Resistance in almost every deck I make.  It can be hard to hold on to, but it can be a life saver at the same time.  I still run into the occasional numbers decks and while this doesn&amp;#8217;t stop numbers, it will only deal two damage to you.  You also get to stop those huge drains of over three.  This can hurt EBO even when you can not cover the sites for Imperial Decree.  This is a bullet like Decree but it help out your ground based decks.<br>
Projection of a Skywalker- This effect is a slow decks dream.  It shoots off a force drain point and can save the light side a few special card that they do not have to lose.  While it does not bullet drains as a whole, it will bullet a point at a time, which in the early game game be enough to help win a game by saving that one card a turn<br>
<br>
Special Edition<br>
Secret Plans- This card was brought out to slow what makes the light side tick.  Force retrieval.  The dark side rellies on the most part trying to beat the light side early while the light side will retrieve what they can and poke away at the dark side.  With have to pay to retrieve, the light side has to save up and prolong some retrieval that might be needed to be done as soon as possible.  While Secrets plans is not a bullet in the strictest of terms, it does hinder the light side strategy tremendously.<br>
<br>
Endor<br>
Security Precautions- I don&amp;#8217;t think Hidden Base caught on too early but when it did, Decipher knew they would have to bullet it.  While you cannot truly bullet a deck type you can make them lose some serious cards in the process.  This is security precautions.  This card makes sure that the light side does not prematurely flip.  With a loss that lessens each system, the light side either has to eat it or pack more systems to help out in there endeavor.  This hinders Hidden Base enough that I included it as a bullet.<br>
Aim High- This card is just mean.  When the dark side actually gets to retrieve, they now have to pay for it.  This is a bullet because many times the dark side won&amp;#8217;t get to retrieve at all since they can not pay for it or they just lose it if they forget.  This bullets what little retrieval they get and the primary function on the card along with the bullet function keeps this card in many competitive decks.<br>
<br>
Death Star II<br>
Menace Fades- At last the light side gets a good Imperial Decree.  Test 1 did the same, but not every deck can use test one.  Menace Fades will bullet decks like Dark Deal and some Tatooine Decks with Gailid.  Menance Fades is easier to hold on to than Decree is, but again I have seen more modifiers in Light Side then I do in dark side.  This has almost become a staple in any good light side deck that can hold both areas.<br>
Lieutenant Blount- ISB Operations is a huge deck type.  Going to worlds means playing some serious ISB decks.  While Blount is no one man army, getting him parked on Coruscant with backup will bullet ISB anyday.  You have to play Blount because he is so all around useful and if he gets to a Coruscant site, ISB will suffer.  He is so obvious I almost did not even put him in here.<br>
Honor of the Jedi- This is probably the most debated bulleted card of all time.  Some people think it is a God-sent, others think it is ass.  Honor will stop the force loss to Visage of the Emperor (Hunt Down), Search and Destroy and a few other cards that poke away at your force.  Three sites is not all too difficult to cover to cancel it, but you can not always rely on getting them.  Even with No Escape, Honor will still see its way into many competitive decks.<br>
You Cannot Hide Forever/Your Insight Serves You Well- Numbers killers, plain and simple.  Numbers will always be out there and people will find cheese ways to use them, but when this effect is out, numbers is just pointless.  YCHF/YISYW bulleted the idea of using numbers and kills it off hand.  The extra uses of effect pulling and Jedi defense reduction is cool, but now what once was a decent idea, has now just about died.  The light side version also stops Scanning Crew, which seems to pop up in manipulation decks here and there.   That kills two birds with on piece of cardboard.<br>
<br>
Premium, Enhanced<br>
Run, Luke, Run- Probably the best bullet card for light side.  This card will cancel Vader&amp;#8217;s Obsession, which means tracking Hunt Down decks cannot turn your Luke with ease.  Luke will run and the threat is over.  This card until recently has not seen much play but people are starting to catch on wit the popularity of Hunt Down growing each expansion.<br>
No Escape- This cards totally demolished what little hope of making a sound Dantooine Base Operations or Local Uprising deck there was.  With the ability to deploy cheap to &lt;&gt; locations, decks that relied on those sites lost their edge.  A deck cannot compete when the dark side is deploying fast against them. The other function of this card is to cancel Honor of the Jedi.  No Escape truly bulleted Honor.  Some say Honor is dead now because of No Escape, but I doubt Honor will never truly die.<br>
Ounee Ta- This card bullets Ralltir Operations.  RallOps is said to have been the strongest deck type ever and Decipher caught on quick.  RallOps were everywhere and other decks were not going to see there way while it existed.  The same way No Escape hurt the &lt;&gt; locations, Ounnee does the same thing.  RallOps cannot thrive when people are deploying like mad to their site.  This card will probably be one of the most hated cards ever to come out.<br>
Corran Horn- What a bullet he is.  He can draw destiny alone, has beefed up power against spies (Mara) and bounty hunters and he can uncover undercovers.  It is so nice to know that if U-3PO or Arica are blocking drains, they will not do so for long once this bad boy comes out.  He has such a great character in the books, you will probably see more of him in the future, but for now, this Corran will be stacked into ninety percent of most decks these days.<br>
Mercenary Armor- Finally an answer to the hated imperial barrier.  I know I carry one or two barriers in all my decks, and I am just glad that most light side decks do not find room for this card.  Widely debated whether it should be across board or at the site, it will always be a great bullet to a great card.  IT is bad enough the dark side usually has a power advantage, but even worse it is horrible when the dark side controls you when you try to get the advantage.  This device will certainly find its way into decks soon.<br>
<br>
I know that many of my choices here are very obvious to some, they are not always known to others.  I have missed many cards that should make this list, but these are the most popular IMHO.  Many will win games if used correctly, so try them out and see if it helps you in your meta.<br>
