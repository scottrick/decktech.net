Hopefully, whether you are a new player, intermediate player, or advanced player, you can take some of the information in these articles and use it to create efficient, tournament-worthy decks.<br>
<br>
We will first discuss the new Dark Side objective: This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time.  This is the exact game text of the card, as confirmed by Decipher.<br>
<br>
--This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time--<br>
Deploy one Cloud City battleground site.  May deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phase, may take Bespin system, Bespin: Cloud City, Dark Deal, or Cloud City Occupation from reserve deck; reshuffle.  Your [CC], [JP], and [SE] are immune to Goo Nee Tay when deploying to Bespin locations.<br>
Flip this card if Dark Deal on table and you occupy Bespin system and Bespin: Cloud City.<br>
<br>
--Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further--<br>
While this side up, Surreptitious Glance may not cancel Dark Deal.  The Planet That It's Farthest From is suspended if targeting Bespin.  Opponent loses 8 force when you play All Too Easy.  At each Bespin location you control with an Imperial, your force drains may not be modified by opponent.  If you have an Alien/Imperial pair in battle, your total battle destiny is +2 (+4 if alien is an Ugnaught).<br>
Flip this card if Dark Deal is canceled, if opponent controls Bespin system or if Bespin is 'blown away.'<br>
<br>
Let us examine the front of the objective.  Notice that when you bring this card into play in the beginning of the game, you may only deploy one location-- and it must be a battleground location.  In addition you are allowed to deploy Secret Plans and All Wrapped Up.  Personally, I love to be able to deploy Secret Plans and still use another starting interrupt.  Deploying All Wrapped Up is another important asset to a deck that centers around capturing.  Also notice that when this side is up, your Cloud City, Jabba's Palace, and Special Edition set characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay.  This function is wonderful because it allows you to use cards such as Boba Fett, Bane Malar, Lando Calrissian, Darth Vader DLOTS, and others with more efficiency on Cloud City.<br>
<br>
The other functions of the card deal specifically with following your game plan.  You are allowed to take a Bespin: Cloud City, Bespin system, Cloud City Occupation, or Dark Deal into hand from reserve deck, once per turn.	Your use of this game text will dictate how your deck will run.  Since you have the option to use Cloud City Occupation, Dark Deal, both, or neither, there are many ways to create competitive decks.	In fact, you do not necessarily even have to flip the objective to have an effective strategy!	However, flipping the card is a good idea and can give you many advantages.  To flip the objective, you must have Dark Deal on the table and you must occupy Bespin and Bespin: Cloud City.<br>
<br>
The back side, Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further, provides some incredible game text if used correctly.  When it is flipped, your opponent cannot cancel Dark Deal with Surreptitious Glance and your opponent cannot use The Planet That It's Farthest From to stop your drains.  In fact, your force drains cannot be modified (on Cloud City) wherever you have an Imperial!  Your battle destinies are also +2 if you have both an Imperial and Alien in a battle (note that if the alien is an Ugnaught it is +4).  Furthermore, your opponent immediately loses eight force when you successfully play All Too Easy!  But now you have reason to worry: all the opponent must do to 'un-flip' your objective is to control Bespin or cancel Dark Deal (which means he has to occupy four *Bespin* locations).  This is why you absolutely must have a  sufficient space fleet to occupy the Bespin system and/or Aqualish, which increase by one the amount of locations the opponent must occupy to cancel Dark Deal.  This is not to say you will lose if your objective flips back, but you must be careful as you play.<br>
<br>
The next step is to build a deck that utilizes this objective.	Here are my suggestions for deck archetypes:<br>
<br>
1) Dedicated Dark Deal with or without flipping-- This is probably the strongest deck that will come from this objective.  The draining power of Dark Deal combined with this objective is deadly.<br>
2) Dedicated Cloud City Occupation deck without flipping-- This deck attempts to not concentrate wholly on draining, but on dealing damage with Cloud City Occupation.	It doesn't requrire as many cards to operate, in my opinion.<br>
3) Capturing decks-- Using the new starting interrupt from Enhanced Cloud City, Any Methods Necessary, you can create some very powerful decks using Bounty's and Dark Deal.  But that isn't even necessary (no pun intended) to make a powerful capturing deck!  Instead, you could use Twi'lek Advisor to immediately put out Carbon-Freezing on the Carbonite Chamber.   Carbon-freezing decks using both All Too Easy and Carbon-Freezing can be powerful strategies.<br>
4) Sabacc-- For a retrieval side strategy using decks centered around Dark Deal or Cloud City Occupation, start with the Casino and use Sabacc!  This is especially useful against draining decks, such as Operatives or Hidden Base.<br>
5) Clouds-- This is useful specifically against Quiet Mining Colony decks that use Clouds; you beat them at their own game!<br>
<br>
There are some cards that are almost essential to the success of decks centered on This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time.  You need lots of starships to control Bespin and Bespin: Cloud City.  I would suggest using Dengar in Punishing One, Bossk in Hound's Tooth, the Executor, any Obsidian TIE's, and Boba Fett in Slave I.  For ground support, you ought to have high ability characters, Aqualish if using Dark Deal, Lobels, and Lift Tubes (if you plan to assault whatever comes your way).  Imperial Arrest Order will stop Nabrun Leids from causing you severe pain.  In addition, Ghhhk is definitely necessary if your characters are spread out over Cloud City.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time is a powerful strategy, it does have weaknesses.	First, the Light Side Objective, Quiet Mining Colony, will be difficult to play against, usually because you probably won't be able to flip your objective very often.  Second, Mains and Toys will be a problem; you must use Ghhhk and either Lobel or Imperial Arrest Order to combat this strategy.  Third, Operatives will be hard to defeat, but by draining quickly and using Secret Plans you will have an easier time.  Fourth, Hidden Base is still powerful and is hard to beat.  You have a speed advantage over Mind What You Have Learned, so most likely you won't have too much trouble in that arena.<br>
<br>
I hope you have enjoyed this article and learned how to use the new objective, This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time.  The next article, which will be on the Light Side objective Quiet Mining Colony, is coming soon.  Thank you for taking the time to read this!<br>
