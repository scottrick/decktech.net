<br>
A Star Wars tournament isnt won by the biggest guy there. It isnt won by the toughest guy there. And it isnt won by the strongest guy there. None of these attributes mean a damn thing when it comes to winning Star Wars tournaments. Star Wars is a game of intellect. And while it isnt always won by the smartest guy there either, you’re not gonna see many dumbasses winning tournaments. <br>
<br>
It takes a pretty smart guy to win a Star Wars tournament. Time and energy is spent working on the best decks possible. Playtesting is done. Strategies are worked out in the player’s mind. Mid-game decisions must be made rapidly. The player thinks about what he is going to do 3 turns from now if his opponent does A and B works and C doesnt work. Much thought is put into the game and that’s why Star Wars is &quot;all about the mind&quot;.<br>
<br>
Since Star Wars is such an intellectual game, we notice a distinct pattern when looking at who is good and who isnt good. The majority of the top players are college-aged. They usually range from 17-25. They are able to grasp concepts and forms strategies better than younger players and they are more creative and inventive than older players. This makes for a perfect combination.<br>
<br>
Of course I’m sure you’re all thinking, &quot;but I know all of this.&quot; And you may be right. But I’m also gonna try to tell you some stuff you may not know. Since I rarely ever touch a Star Wars card, pretty much all I ever do Star Wars wise is think about how to be better. And I’ve come up with a few. I guess I’ll be nice enough to let you in on most of them.<br>
<br>
Sorry but I dont have a nifty name for these rules yet. <br>
<br>
What I’m gonna do is post one or maybe two rules per day. I’ll string them out so as to keep you in suspense. Check back each day to find a new rule. At the end I’ll post all of the rules together as an article just for effect. <br>
<br>
And now... <br>
<br>
Rule #1- Be Yourself/Know Your Limitations(Strengths and Weaknesses) <br>
<br>
This rule is critical. If you can’t do this you’ll never amount to anything in this game. This rule largely relates to the deck building/deck selection process. If you aren’t capable of winning with a deck you didn’t build then dont play a deck you didn’t build. If you aren’t the best deck builder in the world then you need to realize that. Play somebody else’s deck, and don’t worry about what other people might say. As long as you’re winning it doesnt really matter whether or not you built your deck, and anybody who says otherwise is probably just jealous they aren’t winning with it. <br>
<br>
This rule doesnt only apply to who built the deck it also applies to the type of deck you plan on playing. If you know you aren’t good with manipulative decks then dont play one regardless of how good somebody tells you it is. If you don’t feel comfortable playing odds then don’t. On the other hand you need to realize your strengths as well. If you’re good with a deck and you have confidence in said deck then play it even if others would shy away. Playing a 4-star deck that you are extremely familiar with is better than playing a 5-star deck you put together two days ago. <br>
<br>
The last thing this rule applies to, and probably the most trivial, is your attitude and style of play. There are few people in this world(Ray Bordier, Kyle Craft) who can sit down at a table, talk @#$% the entire game and get away with it. If you aren’t one of these people don’t try it. It just makes you look like a fool, especially when you lose. <br>
<br>
Rule #2- Know Your Cards <br>
<br>
This rule is pretty simple and obvious, but it is extremely important. I think its safe to say that if you don’t know the primary function of your cards you don’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell of winning any game. Building your own decks helps in this regard as you always know exactly why a particular card is included. <br>
<br>
Not only do you need to know the primary function of your card(which is usually gonna be the reason you’ve included it in your deck), but you also need to any alternate functions of cards. Many cards have little used functions that can come in very handy at times. Knowing each and every function of each and every card in your deck goes a long way. <br>
<br>
Rule #3- Know Your Opponent’s Cards <br>
<br>
Once you know what all of your cards do playing the deck should become second nature. But you also need to know what the opponents cards do. This goes a very long way toward recognizing the opponent’s strategy and adapting to it. If you don’t know what the opponent’s cards do you’re not going to have a clue what his deck is doing, and the game will be over before it starts. You also need to know secondary functions of the opponent’s cards. A good player will know every function of his cards, and you don’t want to be unprepared. <br>
<br>
Rule #4- Make the Opponent Know His Cards(and yours) <br>
<br>
This rule might not be for everyone. But if you want to consistenly win games, especially the ones you shouldn’t win, then you need to read this rule very carefully. Ever get into a bad matchup? Ever play a less experienced player who is using the only deck you lose to? Well this rule is for you. However, if you’re one of those people who can’t sleep at night if you didn’t play by every single rule then you need to skip rule #4 here and go to the next one. <br>
<br>
How many cards are there in this game that say &quot;opponent loses X force if such and such during such and such phase&quot;? Don’t you ever get tired of losing force or eve games to cards like that? If you ever want to win a major tournament you have got to learn how to win those games that you shouldn’t. This is probably one of the biggest ways to do so. Never, EVER, lose force to such a card voluntarily. <br>
<br>
A good way to do this is to simply pretend that you don’t know what the card does. If the opponent can’t remember what his card does, why should you remind him? One of the best examples of this approach had to be Ray Bordier at GenCon. In a game against Hayes Hunter he repeatedly forgot to lose force to BHBM and claimed to be a newbie when Hayes confronted him about it. didn’t realize the card was on the table. If Order To Engage is out and you failed to battle at all specified locations, the opponent will often point the card out to you. Act surprised and say, &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; <br>
<br>
There is a line that needs to be drawn here. In a normal game at a local tourney that doesnt mean much you don’t want to take this too far. You’ll probably just start voluntarily losing force after the second or third time the opponent reminds you. But if everything’s on the line, make the bastard prove he knows his stuff every single turn of the game. <br>
<br>
But you don’t just want to make the opponent know his cards. You want to make him know yours as well. It never hurts to try to drain for free even when you have your own copy of Battle Plan/Battle Order on the table. You never know when it might win you a game. And, yes, I have done this before. And if they catch you...just act surprised and say, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rule #5- Expect The Expected <br>
<br>
This rule is a bit of an extension of rule #3. While you need to know exactly what each and every card you have seen does, you also need to be ready for what you haven’t seen. The ability to make accurate assumptions about the opponents deck based on only a few cards is one of the differences between great players and average players. During a game against a good player you need to be able to determine what cards he’s using that you haven’t seen in order to further your chances of winning. <br>
<br>
Many decisions you will make during the course of the game will be based on assumptions you’ve made. These assumptions can be based on several things. First you will want to recognize the deck type of the opponent. If they’re playing profit you probably don’t need to fortify in space. One ship will more than likely do the trick. Another way to make assumptions is based on what you have seen. If you’re playing against a traditional ground type deck and you saw a tie, then you had better be expecting more of them. The ability to associate cards you haven’t seen that work well with cards you have seen is crucial. A lot of times a combo deck will tip itself to you if you’ll just pay attention. <br>
<br>
One of the best ways to be prepared for what you haven’t seen is to look at the top decks on Decktech. While not everybody plays exact copies of these decks they will play similar versions. If you know what types of cards go in these decks, then you can be more prepared for them when playing in a tournament. <br>
<br>
You can also come to some conclusions based on how the opponent is playing. If the opponent is saving force you can bet they probably have a reason. You don’t want to walk blindly into a battle when the opponent is saving two force. Getting a character &quot;beaten&quot; isn’t a very fun thing. And it can easily be avoided. <br>
<br>
Once you’ve mastered the art of determining what cards you haven’t seen you’ll be well on your way to victory. <br>
<br>
Rule #6- Don’t Be A @#$% <br>
<br>
This is probably the rule that most seperates the mediocre players from the good players and the good players from the great players. This is probably my personal favorite as well. Decipher won’t mail e-tickets to the timid come November. They’ll mail them to people who force the issue. People who show some balls if you will. <br>
<br>
This rule is all about calculating the odds. You can play this rule to perfection if you’re smart about it, but you can also cause yourself to lose a game if you’re not. Factors that must be considered include, but are not limited to, opponent’s hand size, opponent’s force saved, opponent’s maximum activation, what you’ve seen of the opponent’s deck, what you’re holding in your hand, and of course a good guess using rule #5. And these factors are only the ones associated with deploying cards to establish a safe force drain. You also have to apply rule #6 in many other situations such as determing whether or not to force drain, battle, or move to block a force drain. <br>
<br>
One of the greatest philosophers of this game once told me his many theories. One of them was that many players(even the best) and many decks(even the best) will crumble under pressure. He couldn’t have been more right. One of the reasons that Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi is such a powerful objective is because it puts pressure on the light side player from the very beginning of the game. <br>
<br>
This game is all about force loss. If one player is causing force loss and the other player can’t stop it then he will lose. The idea is that if you force the issue and attempt to cause some force loss the opponent must react to what you are doing. In most cases the player who is playing reactively will eventually react incorrectly and force is lost. Putting pressure on a player and/or a deck will usually cause an incorrect reaction. <br>
<br>
In many games a situation will arise in which you have a choice. You can either A: make a play that will benefit you if the opponent doesnt have card B or you can B: choose not to make said play and allow the opponent time to react. In many cases card B might be very damaging. It is my opinion that you must make the opponent prove that they have card B. This is where calculating the odds comes in. You have to determine the risk and the reward as well as the situation. If the reward outweighs the risk then go for it. If not, you may want to wait until it does. In desparate situations you don’t have such a luxury. You’ll just have to risk it. <br>
<br>
I can recall a certain player watching a game of mine and not understanding how I could play such a style. He didn’t understand why I would take the chance of spreading out to cause force loss when he would’ve probably fortified had he been playing the game. Taking chances is what the game is all about. You never know what the opponent might lose to a force drain on the 2nd turn of the game. It might be something crucial to their success. <br>
<br>
Just a couple of examples to give you an idea... <br>
<br>
Example #1<br>
<br>
In a game at a grand slam this summer two former world finalists were playing a game. The dark side player was playing high destiny hunt down and the other had invaded the holotheatre with Jeroen Webb and Melas. The light side player had a drain of two from the very beginning of the game, but he wouldn’t force drain because he was afraid of Counter Assault. While the dark side player did have 2 in his deck and 1 in hand he hadnt had time to set up his destinies. He later told me that he would’ve waited until he knew the destinies to play the card. <br>
<br>
Had the light side player had the balls to force drain he could’ve potentially lost 10+ force. However, had he been smart about it and known when to stop he could’ve caused just as much damage without taking any upon himself. <br>
<br>
Example #2<br>
<br>
In the final duel of a world qualification tournament earlier this year the dark side player is playing set your course manipulation and the light side player is playing yavin 4. The key to this game is for the light side player to take where he must win by a certain amount of cards. He has the capability to take it to the death star mid game. However, he deduces that if the dark side player has another ship(he’s already seen zuckuss, bossk, and boba fett) that his chances of winning are greatly diminished. The light side player waits and waits waits until it is too late. He loses the game. <br>
<br>
After the game the light side player told me that he thought if the other player deployed zuckuss in mist hunter the game was over. Had the light side player grown some balls he would’ve won the game as the opponent did not have an answer to the drain of 3. <br>
<br>
These are two very nice examples of how to show a lack of testicular fortitude. <br>
<br>
Ever get to a point in a game where you can’t decide upon a course of action? Ever wonder whether or not the opponent will have an answer for said course? I can’t tell you for sure whether he does or not. But I can tell you one thing for damn sure. You’ll never find out if you don’t force his hand.<br>
<br>
Rule #7- Play Your Game(Be Patient) <br>
<br>
Part of being good at the game of Star Wars is knowing the capabilities and limitations of your deck. You have to realize what your deck can and cannot do. For instance, an x-wing swarm deck usually packs a few characters. A good player realizes that these characters should not be attempting to start a war on the ground. This would be ridiculous and in most cases would cost the light side player a game. But this example is probably the simplest part of rule #7. Most people can figure this out all by themselves. <br>
<br>
When you play a good player who knows all about rule #6, he will generally be aggressive. At times it seems as if he is &quot;all over&quot; you. At this point in the game you probably have multiple options. You can either A) rush into a potentially bad situation or B) take some force loss and try to get some better cards into your hand. The ability to make the right decision is crucial. If you know your deck plays slow then play it slow. Forcing the issue will probably only make your deck fall apart. A mistake made in the early game can be just as deadly as one made in the late game. <br>
<br>
While you don’t want to just sit around forever and let the opponent do whatever he wants, you have to be smart about how you react to such a situation. If your deck relies on a combo and you try to play with only part of it you could blow any chance of ever getting the whole thing off. Making the wrong move at this point can be devastating. One of the most common mistakes is initiating a battle without enough beef. A lot of times players will throw something down and hope to draw good destinies. While this works every now and again, more often than not it leaves you minus characters and in the same predicament as before. <br>
<br>
The best way for you to get better at making these decision is to playtest. In a game where such a situation arises take a course of action. Play the game to a point and then go back to the point of indecision and play the game again making the other play. In most cases experience and confidence in your deck will tell you the right play. <br>
<br>
While I definitely advocate rule #6 over rule #7 sometimes you just cant do everything. Some decks aren’t capable of playing by rule #6 in which case you must be especially aware of rule #7. When your opponent is using rule #6, playing the game on his terms will more often than not cost you the game. <br>
<br>
I got tired of the whole Twigg thing. I’m gonna be reposting some new rules pretty soon as I never really finished them before. <br>
