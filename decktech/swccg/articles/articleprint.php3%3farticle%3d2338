If you&#146;re like me, and I know I am, you&#146;ve probably given some thought to how these new effects from Tatooine will enhance the existing objectives they were designed to supplement.  Since in almost every case the cards are designed only to work with their objective, I&#146;ve decided to put together a look at how the objectives were before they changed, and whether or not the new effects have made them strong enough to be played with.  I&#146;ve limited it to these four because, well, the article was getting really really long and I don&#146;t want to waste too much of your time.<br>

This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time - I&#146;m Sorry<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy one Cloud City battleground site. May deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take Bespin system, Bespin: Cloud City, Dark Deal or Cloud City Occupation into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Your [Cloud City], [Jabba&#146;s Palace] and [Special Edition] characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay when deploying to Bespin Locations. {Flip} this card if Dark Deal on table and you occupy Bespin System and Bespin: Cloud City.<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, Surreptitious Glance may not cancel Dark Deal, The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From is suspended if targeting Bespin. Opponent loses 8 Force when you play All Too Easy. At each Bespin location you control with an Imperial, your Force drains may not be modified by opponent. If you have an alien/imperial pair in battle, your total battle destiny is +2 (+4 if alien is an Ugnaught). {Flip} this card if Dark Deal is canceled, if opponent controls Bespin or if Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Dark Side Cloud City objective focused on damaging the opponent using the popular Dark Deal effect and the new and potentially deadly Cloud City Occupation.  Dark Deal&#146;s main use is to enhance force drains on Cloud City, but it requires you to control Bespin: Cloud City and three Cloud City sites.  Also, the Objective requires you to occupy Bespin to flip the objective (and thereby protect your Dark Deal from Surreptitious Glance).  Cloud City Occupation, on the other hand, is direct damage that causes the opponent to lose one force for each battleground site you occupy on Cloud City.  Both are potent, and yet the objective is not played.<br>
<br>
TDIGWATT gives you a single site to begin with, and while it does allow you to pull out Bespin and Cloud City, it doesn&#146;t allow you to pull sites.  So by playing this you are restricting your activation, and you also have to rely on pulling out the other two sites you need for a minimum to flip.  This lack of speed is a problem for TDIGWATT.  What has further put a nail in the coffin of this deck is Menace Fades (although Great Warrior was the card that probably did this in originally).  By canceling the force drain bonuses Dark Deal is pretty useless.  It does give you the benefit of flipping the objective and +4 to your power, but is it worth the time and effort?  The answer in most cases was no, not when faced with more efficient decks.<br>
I would be negligent if I didn&#146;t take the time to mention a couple variants of this.  One was the Sabacc version, which used the starting interrupt Any Methods Necessary to pull out the Security Tower, thereby deploying the dark side Lando first turn.  The deck set up a powerful retrieval engine by having Lando and Lobot at the Casino.  The other variant was the Carbon Chamber super-drain, where you set up a massive drain at the Carbon Chamber and, when the opponent attacked, played All Too Easy to make them lose 8 force (not to mention effectively putting the character out of play).  Easy freeze and require no Ugnaughts or Oompa Loompas or whatever they&#146;re called.  Both were effective rogue decks, but were unable to deliver consistent enough victories to become serious mainstream contenders.<br>
<br>
The New Card: I&#146;m Sorry<br>
Destiny 5 Effect<br>
Deploy on table.  If This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time is on table, once per game may take up to 2 interior Cloud City battlegrounds into hand from Reserve deck; reshuffle.  You may not play Scanning Crew or Imperial Barrier.  (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
What kind of stupid name for a card is &quot;I&#146;m Sorry&quot; anyway?  I don&#146;t like the thought of reading that out loud any more than &quot;Brisky Morning Munchin&#146;.&quot;  I would like to play my cards and still have my dignity.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the real result of using this card is speed.  By starting with it the player begins with a battleground site, may get two more battleground sites, and either Cloud City or Bespin.  A boost in activation, it removes low destiny cards, and helps accelerate the deck towards its goal of controlling Cloud City.  This is not insignificant.<br>
What we do need to see is whether this is enough for this objective.  The main problem this deck still faces is Menace Fades, a common card in light side decks.  For the dark side player to effectively use Dark Deal he needs to quickly control the sites of Cloud City, control Bespin: Cloud City, have an adequate defense of Bespin itself, and still be able to fight the opponent elsewhere by preventing them from controlling a battleground site and a battleground system.  This is asking quite a lot of a single deck with only sixty cards.  If we wanted to do that, we would need powerful yet relatively inexpensive characters and starships.  One possible approach might be starting I&#146;m Sorry, Imperial Arrest Order, and Mobilization Points.  This would allow you an extra docking bay to deploy, more activation, a way to pull out the Executor, and an extra site to deploy Dark Deal (remember, you have to control three sites plus Cloud City).  This would give you good activation to deploy strong characters who can hold their own while your ships move in.  Once you&#146;re secure on Cloud City and the Dark Deal is in place you&#146;re free to take the fight to your opponent if they&#146;re using Menace Fades.<br>
<br>
The alternative to this approach is to forget about Dark Deal and focus instead on just controlling Bespin and Cloud City sites.  Cloud City Occupation is an effective way of dealing lots of damage early in the game that can&#146;t be reduced or stopped (except for Endor Celebration).  With Cloud City Occupation, Bespin: Cloud City is no longer necessary, freeing you to focus on reinforcing your ground and system forces.  For example, let&#146;s say we begin Cloud City: Downtown Plaza.  We start I&#146;m Sorry, Imperial Arrest Order, and Crush The Rebellion (and Secret Plans).  First turn we pull out Bespin, East Platform, and two interior battlegrounds.  We have plenty of sites to deploy to, and on our next turn we&#146;ll be activating a large amount of Force to drop down characters and ships.  On our next turn we can also pull out the Cloud City Occupation for whenever we&#146;re ready.  <br>
<br>
Another way we might play is to substitute An Entire Legion Of My Best Troops in for IAO and play with Stormtroopers.  I know some of you are laughing, since we usually picture these often pathetic characters marching around the mining colony singing the stormtrooper marching anthem, which goes: &quot;Kill me, kill me, kill me...&quot;  Despite this, I think stormtroopers might actually work with those effects and the Admiral&#146;s Order Intensify The Forward Batteries your stormtroopers will be defense value 6 and be deploying for 0-1 force.  With Trooper Assaults this could be a viable way to quickly secure Cloud City and keep it.<br>
<br>
The only problem with not playing Dark Deal is that you don&#146;t get to flip.  You can turn that disadvantage into an advantage by using the Downtown Plaza text along with your objective.  Every turn you can pull out Bespin: Cloud City and lose it for a force drain or some other damage.  Then your next turn for 1 force you can take it back again.  In essence, by putting two of that card in there you can reduce your force loss by one every turn.<br>
<br>
So, for TDIGWATT + I&#146;m Sorry we see that the potential is there for aggressive Dark Deal decks, and that there&#146;s a strong chance that defensive Occupation decks can rear their heads as well.  Sabacc is still possible but, without an early Lando, isn&#146;t very viable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony + Keeping The Empire Out Forever<br>
<br>
	First Side Text: [Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 Force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations. {Flip} this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City). {Place} out of play if Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and [independent] starships are immune to attrition &lt; 4. At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your [independent] starships are deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. {Flip} this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors). {Place} out of play if Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
The downfall of this objective is its intended purpose: to defend everything related to Cloud City.  By demanding that the player hold so much territory flipping the objective-and keeping it flipped-was near impossible.  Also, compared to the power of its dark side counterpart, flipping didn&#146;t provide all that much incentive.  It&#146;s very difficult to put &quot;add 2 to force drains&quot; with &quot;deploy one docking bay&quot; and not snicker.  And so Quiet Mining Colony has never really been taken seriously.  In fact the only time when it seemed popular was when its maelstrom uses were seen: by using tons of miners, Beldon&#146;s Eye, and cloud sectors you generated huge amounts of force.  This would be combined with Descent Into The Dark and Hiding In The Garbage to run abusive strategies, like playing a bunch of Out of Commissions or On The Edge to wreak havoc.  The decks really didn&#146;t take off and with the errata on Descent Into The Dark this deck has been wiped out.  So if anybody can use help it&#146;s Quiet Mining Colony.<br>
<br>
The New Card: Keeping The Empire Out Forever<br>
Destiny 5 Effect<br>
Deploy on table.  If you control two Cloud City sites and occupy Bespin system, flip Quiet Mining Colony.  While Independent Operation on table, it may not flip and once per turn may search your Force Pile and take one card there into hand; reshuffle. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
Great case of mis-matched artwork: there&#146;s stormtroopers all over the place...<br>
<br>
With Keeping The Empire Out Forever flipping Quiet Mining Colony is easier than a cheerleader at a frat party.  This card helps the objective by going directly to the problem with this deck, which is covering all those locations.  Flipping the objective was hard and keeping it flipped was even worse, but now the number of locations that the dark side controls is irrelevant.  An objective that can&#146;t be flipped back is powerful because it&#146;s reliable.  Once you flip you don&#146;t have to worry about Ralltiir Operations because their -1 to force drains won&#146;t effect you, nor will Den of Thieves or Dreaded Imperial Starfleet.  The immunity to attrition &lt; 4 is already good, and can become even better if you use the Admiral&#146;s Order Concentrate All Fire (it gives your characters with immunity +2).  Lando with Blaster Pistol now has immunity to attrition &lt; 6 and gets an extra point for his permanent weapon.  Or you can go with No Questions Asked and give the benefit to your independent starships.  Not only does Z-95 Bespin Defense Fighter deploy for 1 to Bespin and is power 5, it&#146;s also immune to attrition &lt; 6.  In addition, your smugglers on Cloud City can make a move during their control phase or fire their blasters (Lando with Blaster Pistol, Chewie with Blaster Rifle, Han with Heavy Blaster Pistol are examples of characters who can abuse this).<br>
<br>
Both of these are useful, but neither really compares with the added bonus of Keeping The Empire Out Forever.  With this card you get an uncounterable Tunnel Vision every turn.  I don&#146;t have to tell you just how powerful that is, and this is what goes a long way towards making Quiet Mining Colony a potent deck.<br>
<br>
I can see two directions this deck can take.  One is the Celebration version, which would control lots of sites on Cloud City and use Cloud City Celebration for retrieval.  With most if not all your characters immune to attrition &lt; 4 (or 6) maintaining a presence at multiple sites won&#146;t be difficult at all.  Weather Vane may actually be useful in such decks as an unstoppable Bacta Tank, if a player wished to focus on fewer characters and higher destinies (Desperate Reach being 5 and Fall of the Legend being 6).  Since the Bespin Defense Fighter is so effective here, these decks might use Close Air Support for the exterior sites (playing with a few alien scouts of course).<br>
<br>
The other direction this objective could take is cloud control.  Bespin: Cloud City and three cloud sectors combined with Tibanna Gas Miners and, dare I say it, Beldon&#146;s Eye, could activate colossal amounts of force every turn (remember, you get to search your Force Pile for any card, so the more you activate the better).  You&#146;ll be draining for 2 at each cloud sector, and the only thing that can stop that is Imperial Decree (assuming you put an alien on board one of them, of course).  Cloud Cars with Maneuvering Flaps or Z-95s (useful for All Wings Report In and Rebel Fleet) can control the systems, and Local Defense gives you a second destiny for any TIEs that do show up.<br>
<br>
Another way to play this (if we stretch our imaginations) would be using only three exterior sites (Casino, Downtown Plaza, Docking Bay) and the cloud sectors and play with... wait for it... speeders!  Speeders?  Yes, a speeder at each exterior Cloud City site, and use your cloud cars/Z-95s for the 4 sectors.  Play T-47 battle formation and you drain for 16 force just from the cloud sectors.  And remember, unless they have Imperial Decree out they can&#146;t do anything about any drain where you have an alien.  I&#146;m not sure how potent this would be, but considering that you can pretty much pull out whatever you like from your deck whenever you need it, it certainly wouldn&#146;t be that hard to set up.<br>
Keeping The Empire Out Forever is a huge reversal for this objective.  By making the flip easier and adding the bonus for flipping it is a far more viable deck than it ever was, and has a good chance of becoming a dominant decktype.<br>
<br>
<br>
Set Your Course For Alderaan + A Million Voices Crying Out<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy Death Star and Alderaan systems and Docking Bay 327.] {For} remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth or a Subjugated planet. {While} this side is up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take on card with &quot;Death Star&quot; in title into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. You may not Force drain at Alderaan system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled. {Flip} this card if Alderaan is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 if [Victory] class) to Death Star system. Your Force Drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +2 (or +1 if [Victory] class). If Yavin 4 system is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponent&#146;s Yavin 4 site. {Place} out of play if Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
Many of us were quite anxious when we first heard about this objective.  Blowing up planets is fun, but it&#146;s not an easy thing to do, what with the superlaser and the gunners and the Death Star sites and the epic event and moving the poky thing around, you usually were near death by the time you actually blew anything up.  While this objective did make blowing planets up a lot easier, the built in restriction-Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth, or Subjugated Planet-took a lot of the joy out of blowing planets up.  Combined with the fact that it was only mildly easier and the back side wasn&#146;t remarkable, the objective&#146;s main use was as a starting strategy for manipulators or TIE recursion.<br>
<br>
Even though you could deploy a great deal of the stuff from the Reserve deck to get this deck going, there was one card that you had to get the old fashioned way: Commence Primary Ignition.  This Epic Event was a serious problem because it&#146;s a destiny 0 and, if you miss the planet, it goes back into your used pile and you have to look for it again.  What a pain.  It was just one more example of the problem with trying to flip Set Your Course For Alderaan, and so while a few brave souls built some competitive decks with it, for the most part it remained the platform objective.<br>
<br>
The New Card: A Million Voices Crying Out<br>
Destiny 5 Effect<br>
Deploy on Table.  Twice per game may take Commence Primary Ignition into hand from Lost Pile or Reserve Deck; reshuffle.  If Alderaan &quot;blown away,&quot; retrieve 3 force whenever you deploy a unique(.) Star Destroyer. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
&quot;I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.  I fear Kevin J. Anderson may have written another book.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks to A Million Voices Crying Out every card you need to flip the objective can be pulled out and used, giving the deck the speed it needs to function.  The fact that it can come from the Lost Pile is a double bonus.  If you lose it to a force drain (whether accidentally or on purpose) you can still get it back into your hand.  Also, if you took out Alderaan on the first punch, you can sail right on to a rebel base and take care of business a second time.  (&quot;You maniacs!  You blew it up!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!!!&quot;)  You get two shots with a single CPI, a vast improvement over having to pack two to four in the hopes of getting one in time.<br>
<br>
The objective still faces some speed trouble.  You need enough sites to be able to hit, and it would be best to have out some Death Star Gunners (they pull out the Superlaser anyway).  Granted you don&#146;t suffer any battle damage on the Death Star, but having your characters killed isn&#146;t going to get the traitorous Alderaanians blown up.  Also, the Death Star locations are good drain sites for your opponent, and you certainly don&#146;t want to give him anything he can use against you.  At the same time, having a bunch of characters on the Death Star doesn&#146;t accomplish much.  Controlling a site that you can&#146;t drain at serves little purpose, so spending force and time deploying characters to them is often a waste of resources.  One of the best choices would be to use Put All Sections On Alert.  Not only can it help deal with EPPs, but if your opponent sends down a spy and slaughters your Gunners you can at least get them back from the Lost Pile.  <br>
<br>
I would advise deploying a single gunner to a non-battleground site, and keep them away from attacking characters.  This way if a spy drops in the most they&#146;ll take out is one (and you won&#146;t have any battle damage to fear).  Get the Superlaser out fast and blow up Alderaan chop chop.  Fortunately it&#146;s only 2 parsecs from your starting point, so that shouldn&#146;t be a problem.  With each gunner adding 2 to your draw you should be able to blow up the planet with only one try (you can use The Dark Path to set up your destiny if you like sure things).  Immediately after blowing away Alderaan you flip, but it&#146;s still your control phase.  This is important because your gunners no longer are protected (the &quot;no battle damage&quot; clause is only on the front side of the card) and are begging the light side to kick the crap out of them.  Have them use their gametext to search for a superlaser by going to the Used Pile.  You&#146;ve now taken them out of harms way.  The worst case scenario is that your opponent plays three Changing The Odds on you and makes you lose three interrupts out of your deck (a rather unlikely scenario), but since you&#146;ve just added 3 to your life force it all balances out.<br>
<br>
Another method of blowing up the planets is putting the Emperor on board the Death Star, usually at the Conference Room to add to the CPI destiny number.  Since he&#146;s immune to attrition and there is no battle damage he can&#146;t be harmed.  This could be supplemented by putting a Presence of the Force there and sending in Janus Greejatus, allowing you to force drain for two there once you&#146;ve flipped (the force drain clause also is not on the back side).<br>
<br>
The real benefit to flipping is the power you now possess in space.  You can deploy battleground systems straight from your Reserve, and you have a substantial benefit from using Star Destroyers.  First, a +2 to your Force drains where there&#146;s an Imperial or Super-class, and each of those deploy -2 to Death Star(Victories are 1 for both).  As if that weren&#146;t incentive enough, you now get to retrieve 3 Force for each unique star destroyer.  If you&#146;re wondering, there are fourteen: Devastator, Conquest, Tyrant, Stalker, Avenger, Executor, Vengeance, Flagship Executor, Chimaera, Thunderflare, Accuser, Judicator, Dominator, and Visage.  This is probably more capital ships than you need, but if not you can still supplement the fleet with some Death Squadron Star Destroyers (they also have a great deploy and get the force drain bonus if they don&#146;t retrieve).  With a fleet like this you&#146;ll have little trouble controlling space.<br>
<br>
An ironic problem that comes from this is this: while your opponent will find it next to impossible to control a battleground system to satisfy Menace Fades (and cancel your +2 force drains) an empty Death Star would probably give them the three sites they need to satisfy it.  This is why the Emperor choice might be a good one, or else just keep some heavy hitters in your deck to knock them off the Death Star (combined with your Put All Sections On Alert, cleaning out the Death Star shouldn&#146;t prove difficult if it becomes necessary).<br>
<br>
Sienar Fleet Systems made TIEs powerful by retrieving one force, and it should be obvious that tripling the amount of Force is even better.  Return To Base might be a choice for these decks, since you can relocate one of your star destroyers to Used Pile, take it back into your hand, and drop it down to retrieve three force.  The only problem is the obvious cost: even a low deploy ship like Thunderflare will be requiring 12 Force to get off Return To Base and get redeployed to the Death Star.<br>
<br>
The most obvious way to exploit this is to just play big blue.  You can use Imperial Command + Admirals to limit attrition, Admiral Chiraneau to add even more to force drains, Grand Admiral Thrawn to just continue to kick @#$% and take names, and of course the Admiral&#146;s Order We&#146;re In Attack Position Now to provide immunity to attrition &lt; 4.  This can be further enhanced by Kuat Drive Yards, which not only provides an automatic immunity to all Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but also allows you to deploy them from your Reserve Deck.  Since Kuat isn&#146;t a battleground you would need to rely on Mobilization Points to get it out.  Something Special Planned is a nice way to round out your starting three effects, since it makes that Hyperescape a lot harder to pull off and can screw up retrieval engines.  Another choice might be Oppressive Enforcement, just because you are packing so many low destiny capital ships.<br>
<br>
The rarely mentioned portion of the card, one which might become more important depending on the metagame, is the bonus to blowing up Yavin 4.  If your opponent is playing a Yavin 4 based deck then blowing away the system will have a devastating affect on the game, if not ending it right there and then.  Even if they don&#146;t, they do lose two force for every icon at a rebel base that&#146;s blown away, and if you can combine it with A Day Long Remembered you can hurt them substantially even if they aren&#146;t playing Yavin 4.<br>
<br>
Despite the obvious advantages now provided for SYCFA flipping the card is still a bit of work and rather card intensive.  Whether players will decide if the benefits outweigh this or not remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Massassi Base Operations - Great Shot Kid!<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin4: Docking Bay.] {For} remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors. {While} this side up, you generate no more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4.  {Flip} this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls fewer than three Yavin 4 sites. {Place} out of play if Yavin 4 is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Your total power is +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponent&#146;s Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force Drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter with a pilot character aboard are each +2.<br>
<br>
The word &quot;ass&quot; is listed in this card&#146;s name twice.  Coincidence?<br>
<br>
Much like Quiet Mining Colony, Massassi Base Operations is an objective most players pass over because of the Herculean task involved in doing all of the things required to gain the benefits of this deck.  First you&#146;ve got to control 3 Yavin 4 locations with pitiful activation, then you&#146;ve got to set everything up to blow away the Death Star, then you&#146;ve got to actually fly some guys in and blow it up.  After all that, what do you get?  A benefit that&#146;s not even as good as Echo Base Operations, a far easier card to complete.  Oh sure, this can&#146;t be canceled like EBO if your opponent raids the base, but since you&#146;ve handed your opponent all these nice Yavin 4 sites completing Imperial Decree is as easy as 3.14.  <br>
<br>
The problem with MBO is that going to all that trouble isn&#146;t worth it when you look at the final results.  If your opponent is playing the Death Star this can be a good way to hurt him, but in most situations the result of all that work just isn&#146;t worth it.<br>
<br>
The New Card: Great Shot Kid!<br>
Destiny 5 Effect<br>
Deploy on table.  If Death Star &quot;blown away&quot;: once during each of your turns you may deploy (for free) a starship from hand or Reserve Deck and reshuffle; if you just deployed a unique(.) starship to a system location, retrieve 3 force. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone set us up the bomb!&quot; &quot;What you say?!&quot;<br>
<br>
This card provides further incentive to blow away the Death Star with an effect similar to A Million Voices Crying Out.  The difference in this case is that it can be any unique starship, and you can deploy a free ship each turn, even from your Reserve.  <br>
<br>
With Great Shot Kid! we basically turn Massassi Base Operations into the old Test 5 Jedi Training decks: if they can survive long enough to finish what they need to do they can effectively retrieve their entire lost pile and turn the game around.  The problem with both is surviving that long, especially keeping in mind the problems the objective gives you.  So what this card does doesn&#146;t make your work any easier, it just offers you a bigger prize if you pull it all off.<br>
<br>
The first step to completing MBO is flipping your objective, which means quickly controlling three Yavin 4 sites.  Mercifully the objective can&#146;t be flipped back so you can quickly deploy, flip, and get the hell out of Dodge.  A pretty good way of doing this would probably involve Strike Planning, since you can pull out two generals with that.  If one of those is Madine, he can be used to pull out scouts to finish controlling the base.  An alternative would be to play with EPPs who can serve as effective exterminators, but the problem is that since you can&#146;t force drain on Yavin having an army there is kind of hard to justify.  In either case, flipping isn&#146;t going to be too hard, but it&#146;s only the first step in the process.<br>
<br>
You&#146;re going to need to get out the cards to destroy the Death Star quickly as well: Attack Run, a ship with Proton Torpedoes, Death Star: Trench, and the Death Star itself.  All of these, with the exception of the ship, can be pulled out of your deck one way or another.  Completing the Attack Run is also not going to be easy, although you do get a bonus for every Yavin site out whether there are Imperials there or not.  I won&#146;t dwell too much on this, since you can easily see what cards help you during your Attack Run.  Deciding which works best depends on the type of deck you&#146;re playing.<br>
<br>
I know people have already been laughing, so here&#146;s something more to laugh at: Mon Mothma.  Yes, yes, I know, uglier than great-grandma on &quot;shave me legs&quot; day and pretty expensive, but consider that she can be pulled with Strike Planning and can deploy a non-unique rebel every turn.  &quot;Non-unique rebels suck!&quot;  In most cases yes, but if we want to blow up the Death Star there&#146;s a good rebel for that, the Rebel Tech.  The advantage Mon Mothma gives is that, since she can deploy them herself, you don&#146;t have to wait to flip the objective to get the Tech, which means you don&#146;t have to wait to get the Trench.  And if you choose to use the Rebel Tech to boost your Attack Run destinies you can move twice as fast by using Mon Mothma instead of the objective to pull them out.<br>
<br>
Once you have everything set you need to get your piloted starship with proton torpedoes into position for the Attack Run.  Since you probably can&#146;t deploy to the Death Star you&#146;ll need to first move to the system and then do the Attack Run.  Note that while going into the Trench is free it&#146;s also a regular move, which means that you can&#146;t move to the Death Star and then go into the Trench unless you carry it aboard a capital starship and then disembark at the Death Star system.  Considering the benefits of blowing away the Death Star from the objective and Great Shot Kid! it might be wise to mix capital ships and piloted fighters anyway.<br>
<br>
A brief moment for Down With The Emperor.  I agree that using this would be quite a boon, the final nail in the dark side&#146;s coffin.  But remember that in order to use it you need to have no Vaders, no Emperors, and no Mauls on the table.  While it might be worth the effort, I submit that this deck is already trying to do a hell of a lot as it is; turning it into a dark jedi exterminator on top of everything else is going a bit too far.  Might as well just cure cancer while you&#146;re at it.  Since it is a six destiny, though, I could see why you might pack one, just on the off chance they&#146;re not playing any dark jedi.<br>
<br>
Okay, the final hurdle is passed like a bad kidney stone.  Now would be the time to play as many unique ships as possible.  Matching pilots are a natural choice, but since you can only pull out one per turn using Squadron Assignments it won&#146;t be easy to deploy more than one a turn.  Some inexpensive ships that might be worth considering are Gold Leader in Gold 1 and Lando in Millennium Falcon since they are unique starfighters that have capacity for a pilot to be added.  <br>
<br>
You can deploy Home One for free, so take advantage of it.  Also, it allows unlimited numbers of pilots, passengers, vehicles, and... starfighters.  Why is that important?  Because all you have to do to retrieve your three force is to deploy your unique starfighter to a system location.  In other words, say you&#146;ve got Gold 4 in your hand but you don&#146;t have Lieutenant Lepira.  If you deploy Gold 4 to the cargo bay of Home One while it&#146;s at a system (a legal move, since ships can deploy to cargo holds without pilots) you retrieve your 3 force (it still was deployed to the system location, even though it&#146;s on the ship).  If you get Lepira you can put him on board and fly him out, no harm done.  Or, if you suffer some battle damage, forfeit Gold 4 (since ships in the cargo bay, even if not piloted, participate in battles) and send it to Docking and Repair Facilities to be taken back to your hand for 1 force.  Or play with Koensayr Manufacturing to just retrieve it and play it from Reserve deck.  Either way you can send it down to Home One to retrieve 3 force (4 if at Anoat, heh heh). <br>
<br>
What Great Shot Kid! does is sweeten the pot for players who might have thought about playing Massassi Base Operations but didn&#146;t feel it was powerful enough.  If the deck can survive long enough and be intact enough once the Death Star is destroyed, it should be able to rally and turn the game around.  But, because of the difficulty of pulling this off, this objective still will probably not see the level of play that other, easier, objectives do.<br>
<br>

You&#146;ve reached the end?  Wow!  Hopefully there was some useful info in there to start with some new deck ideas.  All of them have fresh chances on life thanks to these effects.  Good luck with your decks and remember, if someone annoys you, just call them a &quot;dikfore.&quot;  Goodnight. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
