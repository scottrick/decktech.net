That is the way in which they approach the game table and deliver the point of their efforts (decks) to others. I have recently come to notice that you will know who is going to walk away from a match advancing and who is not. I have actually started to classify these different character types as well. And in doing so have been able to decipher (no pun intended) the body and style of deck that they have built after seeing their starting setup.<br>
<br>
The easiest way for me to do this is to break it down into groups of three. Three is a good number anyway. I’ll start with personality types. The first personality type is that of the egotist. These folks will rarely offer a kind word and get easily frustrated at the slightest hint of potential loss. The egotist is the very essence of poor sportsmanship. And this you can capitalize on. If the game is not going their way expect them to cheat. Have them count back what they activate, have them announce each and every phase of their turn. In short if this person wants to hand you a loss then their going to have to do it in spite of themselves.<br>
<br>
The next person up to bat is the pessimist. Also a poor sport but will see things that the egotist will not. Just play your game as quietly as you can and this person beats themselves. That’s right, they are the ones who talk themselves into sending little old Han into the throne room alone with no cards in their hand to back him up. And as he takes his beat down you sit there quietly, not smugly, and take the win. Shake their hand and compliment them on some aspect of their game and move on. This is a winning situation.<br>
<br>
Next comes the rules lawyer. They want to the get the best end of the stick every time. If a situation does occur with this type its because they can’t play that combo that they thought they could and are calling the judge over every five minutes after that to make sure what you just did is really legal. The judge will get tired of it fast and be on your side pretty much the rest of the game if you play this one right. Expect to win this one too. The best aspect of this match though is that they lack a certain amount of finesse.<br>
<br>
The one to really watch out for is the player. They came to win and have nothing else in mind. They will be focused and lightly conversational. They will share information and deck designs as well as what they have in their own decks. They don’t have any fear of the game itself so they won’t lose control of themselves. In short, this is the person to beat. Because if you don’t you’ll place second at best. His attitude has already won him the fair share of his games. His deck building skills are good to great, but its his cool, calm, and control that see him through to the end of the day. He is the most dangerous of your opponents. In possession of great amounts of skill and finesse, this person is a privilege to play with. Beware also; they are true innovators of the game.<br>
<br>
All right, that was four. So what. I think though that I will stick to three with my next grouping. And that category would be deck focus. Most players focus their decks in one of three ways. They are Power, Finesse, and Balance.<br>
<br>
A Power player (myself included) is of a much more confident and aggressive nature. Often throwing little caution to defense. Their defense is often a veritable juggernaut of an offense. As defense goes it is usually splashed only as a last resort and then only in the form of SAC. To many players this is not a problem, but to this one it can be frustrating to have unusable cards. Focus on that frustration and you will win. On the other hand, the power player can also be one of the most devastating opponents to face at the table. They often can reduce your deck with only one battle. Some times drawing four or more destinies at once. This player’s main objective is to crush everything in their path.<br>
<br>
Finesse players are THE MOST DANGEROUS players in the game today! They innovate the environment and revive some of the older or forgotten strategies to take key victories away in tournaments. I once faced a Walker deck with Profit (yes I know Profit sucks eggs) and was destroyed. Why? Because the other player figured out how to keep me from accomplishing my goals without having to involve himself in battles on Tatooine at all. How about a Rescue The Princess that cannot be stopped? I’ve seen it and it was a finesse minded player that did it. I’ve also seen some of the best combos ever from some of the crappiest cards I’ve ever seen. Trust me, if you see something new file it in memory and learn from this opponent. Or you’ll never be able to compete on their level.<br>
<br>
Balance player is one of my favorite opponents to face. They seem to have this need to face you on the ground and in space. Or with tech and power. Speed and finesse. When they find a good setup, they may work it to the point of perfection only to be undone by a single card. They may seem like a finesse player at first glance, but they are not. They don’t innovate, they extrapolate from others and adapt. Don’t get me wrong; these are still very respectable card players. They just aren’t going to go out and create the next Hunt Down or Watch Your Step super decks that Decipher has to go and worry about.<br>
Although they will play their decks VERY well. Look for the crux to the deck or some other weakness and you’ll be able to exploit it. <br>
<br>
Well that wraps up my thoughts on this topic. If it helps you great, if not I hope it was at least interesting to read how another player thinks. Come to think of it, this could come back to haunt me…<br>
