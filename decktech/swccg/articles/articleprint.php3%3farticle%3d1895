I&#146;m NOT saying that slaughtering a newbie is a bad thing. That&#146;s not what the deck is about. You also must realize the difference between a newbie and a scrub; this is just for a first-timer you might play in the first round. Beat the pants off &#146;em if you want to, but do it right.<br>
<br>
First off, DON&#146;T CHEAT! Newbies won&#146;t catch you, and if you seem respected by everyone around you, he&#146;s not even going to question you. Just don&#146;t do it:<br>
* Sensing something that&#146;s immune<br>
* Mis-quoting game text that your opponent can&#146;t see instead of showing him/her<br>
* Deploying for a Force less than normal<br>
* Altering an Immediate Effect<br>
* Cancelling your own effect with Alter and putting it in your Used to Wise Advice/OE<br>
<br>
And the list goes on and on. Little things that can change the game around. Are you really so afraid of a newcomer that you need to cheat in order to win the game?<br>
<br>
Also, help out on occasion. Newbies don&#146;t know their own game text. Don&#146;t necessarily mention every little missed detail, but offer advice on the game-altering events, and say it just once. If they forget again, that&#146;s their fault. Remind them again after the game, along with some of the little things, such as:<br>
* Forgetting to drain (only remind once, of course)<br>
* Draining for 5 with bonuses even though Menace Fades/Imp Decree is in effect<br>
* Deploy +2 to Ralltiir, Goo Nee Tay, or Bad Feeling Have I<br>
* The -1 to drains to whatever modifier either player might have<br>
* Drawing asteroid destinies<br>
* If they&#146;re missing a major bonus, remind them once per game.<br>
<br>
Again, unless a newcomer&#146;s deck is so powerful that it will beat the snot out of yours, help them out a little.<br>
<br>
I constantly see experienced players taking advantage of scrubs and newbies with reference to Dagobah rules, how Sense/Alter works, Sheilded locations, and false erratas to suit their purpose. A veteran player is not going to lose to a new player! I&#146;m not asking you to lower your score by helping them with a ruling. Just play a fair game, or you might lose a potentially awesome player. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
