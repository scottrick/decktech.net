There will always be talk about the universal card.  The one card that fits into any strategy and should always be included in any winning deck.  I think that card is a character, 4-Lom with Concussion Rifle.<br>
<br>
Why is he so powerful?	Read on.  First let me spend some time on the obvious and then I will get to the not so obvious.<br>
<br>
Let&#146;s take a walk through 4-Lom&#146;s lore.  He is a Thief and Information Broker, which don&#146;t do much of anything right now.  He is a Bounty Hunter and that is big.  As a Bounty Hunter, 4-Lom gets a monster list of cards that can be used with him.  To start it off, he can capture characters using All Wrapped Up and We Have A Prisoner.  Because he is a droid the light side cannot free any of these captured characters when 4-Lom is sitting by himself or with another droid.  4-Lom&#146;s favorite companion is IG-88 with Riot Gun who by themselves can draw a destiny, capture a character, cancel game text, and not even be battled by the Light side.   That is a powerful combo.  A Bounty Hunter can also use the card Jabba&#146;s Through With You to add a battle destiny when firing a weapon and 4-Lom fits that bill nicely.	Also, a minor benefit is that his forfeit goes up to 5 when played with Court.	I will discuss others benefits down in the combo&#146;s section.<br>
<br>
Lets take a quick look at his attributes.  With a power of two, 4-Lom isn&#146;t going to do any beatdown and with no ability he isn&#146;t going to drain anybody to death.  His Armor of three makes him slightly harder to hit than your average Chewie, which is nice.  His deploy and forfeit of three are relatively low.  His destiny of three is low as well.  4-Lom&#146;s attributes aren&#146;t going to do much for you.  He isn&#146;t even a pilot either.  Luckily, he has a lot more going for him.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at 4-Lom&#146;s game text one sentence at a time.  &quot;Adds one battle destiny with Jabba or Zuckuss.&quot;   This is huge.  Multiple destinies are where the beatdowns take place.  If you played back in Premiere days you remember drawing up and waiting for that one battle where you played every destiny-adder in your deck and your opponent did the same.  Whoever had the most destinies, or most Sense/Alters, won.	Instead of having those lost interrupts you can have your characters do the destiny adding.  4-Lom is one of the best because of his playability.  Any Court or Scum deck would be foolhardy to not have Jabba; 4-Lom is made for Jabba.  On the other hand any space deck worth its salt has Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.  Right now, that ship has the most powerful game text of any in the game.  If you use that ship than 4-Lom can add a battle destiny when he is aboard it.  The second sentence of his game text is where the beauty lies.  &quot;Permanent weapon is 4-Lom&#146;s Concussion Rifle (May target for free; target may not use its game text for remainder of turn.)&quot;  His permanent weapon cancels the game text of any character without any draw?  That is huge.  Gone are all those rebels with high Immunity to Attrition like Jedi Luke and Obi.	Gone are all those EPP permanent weapons like Lando w/Vibro Ax and Leia with Gun.  Gone is Chewie&#146;s roar, General Solo&#146;s battle destiny canceling, and Ben Kenobi&#146;s reviving.  None of those mains get to use their gametext.  That is bigger than huge.  If you initiate the battle you get to use his ability before the Light side can even do anything about it.  When light side initiates, the lightside takes an action but you still get to cancel someone&#146;s gametext.  Plus it lasts for the whole turn so Ben Kenobi cannot revive any dead characters.	HUGE!<br>
<br>
4-Lom has gone into almost every one of my decks since he came out.  I usually pack two of him so that I can use his text anytime I want.  I pack 4-Lom so often that he is becoming Vader&#146;s best friend even over Tarkin.<br>
<br>
To counter 4-Lom I have been packing an old friend from Premiere, Wioslea.  If Wioslea survives a turn then he can try to buy 4-Lom on the control phase and use as a light side card.	I haven&#146;t actually gotten this to work but Wioslea is a 5 destiny character that deploys for 1.  So he doesn&#146;t hurt in any deck.  Another option is to try a Restraining Bolt.  It is a destiny 6 card but it can&#146;t be easily recycled and it won&#146;t do you much good..  That one isn&#146;t my first choice.  There is the Jawa Ion Gun from New Hope that lets you take 4-Lom but I have never used this crazy thing.  Snipering or killing him in a battle work too.<br>
<br>
Now, let&#146;s look at some combo&#146;s.<br>
<br>
Obvious Combo&#146;s:<br>
4-Lom with Jabba, or Zuckuss, or Zuckuss in Mist Hunter:  This is slap upside the face obvious and is what 4-Lom was made to do.  Draw your destinies.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with IG-88:  This is anvil on the noggin obvious but it is so powerful that I can&#146;t help but mentioning it.	Put them together if you have em.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with Jabba&#146;s Through With You:  In a battle 4-Lom gets to add a battle destiny with a destiny-5 used interrupt.  You better track that sucker.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with IG-88:  That is three destiny with three cards on a super-powered ship.	That is a miniature Super-Falcon.  Too bad the real Falcon would cut this combo to threads.<br>
<br>
Favorite Combo&#146;s:<br>
4-Lom with Disarmed:  This is currently my favorite use of 4-Lom&#146;s Permanent Weapon.  Put him down at a site with any light side EPP or lightsaber wielding main.	You don&#146;t need to worry about any beatdown cause 4-Lom is a droid.  Then, on the LIGHT side control phase play Disarmed.  Now you are all set for Dr. Evazan to join the party but you don&#146;t have to till you are all ready to go.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with Sniper:  When 4-Lom has already been deployed, use Sniper on your control phase.  His gun lasts the whole turn so that on your battle phase two characters will not have their game text.  Nice.  (WARNING: The following may not be legal.	Try 4-Lom Snipering your own Emperor.  That way you can move him to a site with Light Side characters.	I just don&#146;t know if you can Sniper your own characters any more.)<br>
<br>
Way Out There Combo&#146;s:<br>
4-Lom with E Chu Ta:  4-Lom is a Protocol droid and so he can use this Cloud City Interrupt.  It does the same thing as 4-Lom&#146;s gun but is only destiny three.  Or you can use the other part of its game text to battle with droids but that is only going to happen when&#8230;that isn&#146;t going to happen.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with Madalorian Armor:  Ok this is a stretch.  You can play Hidden Weapons and his Armor goes up.<br>
<br>
Some non-game related tidbits:	Did you know&#8230;<br>
4-Lom is short for For Love Of Money.  Cause he is a bounty hunter.<br>
4-Lom and Zuckuss go over to the lightside after the battle of Endor and Zuckuss becomes a jedi.<br>
4-Lom falls in love with R2-D2 and C-3PO.  They get married in a strange 3-way droid wedding.  Chewie cries.<br>
4-Lom captures every Ewok on Endor by himself but kills them all when he realizes the bounty on them is zero.<br>
<br>
4-Lom with Concussion Rifle fits into any deck be it Scum, Hunt Down, BHBM, Space, and anything else you may imagine.<br>
