<br>
I am writing this cause this is what I feel... when the game started some years back, &#146;95 I think... or was it &#146;96 either way when it started I started cause I love Star Wars...and well yeah like everyone else that plays we love the game and the movie... When this game first came out asides from figuring out Attrition/Battle Damage or Destiny the game was pretty simple. He who had the most cards had the best decks...  There wasn&#146;t much more to it. I recall one deck by a friend of mine that consisted of the following Obi-Wan Kenobi x5, Lightsaber x3, Lightsaber Proficiency x3, Obi-Wan&#146;s Hut, a bunch of 2/1 sites or 2/0 sites if they were there, Nabrum Leids x12, Revolution x10, Sense and Alters (fillers) and few other small things...and essentially all he would do is Nabrum from Site to Site and force drain and then Nabrum away after the battle started...or before. But that was the deck...what more.<br>
<br>
As time went on decks changed and people started to have to &#146;tech&#146; there decks somewhat... and then things went KABLOOEEE!! when Special Edition came out and that changed the game 100%...<br>
<br>
Well as the game went through it&#146;s changes and the &quot;chosen&quot; stayed with it some people left and why is this. They didn&#146;t like the way things were changing, they didn&#146;t want to give it a chance, they weren&#146;t sure what to think because their &#146;teched &amp; tested&#146; decks that were undefeated suddenly became weak and they didn&#146;t want to test their therioes... so people started harping and things started getting worse for the game...<br>
<br>
Somethings came out that made it better, certain sets brought different things to the game... starting effects/interrupts and whatnot, and again people that had their great decks were suddenly changing them and making them better or quitting because they didn&#146;t want to change their &#146;teched&#146; decks... sad, but true and I am sure that as you are reading this you to, probably thought of quitting the game because of a new set... and now your probably wonder why this article is written...well here&#146;s the cruxed of the Article.<br>
<br>
Since Tatooine &amp; Courscant have come out people have only @#$%ed about Podracing and Senate and that every deck has to have them to win... that&#146;s not true, quit your freakin&#146; bellyachin&#146; and listen for a minute. Just because someone wants to use a deck to have Podracing doesn&#146;t make them cheap, yes it&#146;s a cheap strategy, but it can be defeated throw some cards in your deck that can help (ie: Podrace Collision or A Step Backwards) - great your thinking why would I want to waste those slots, well PC is good if the opponent just verified their deck and didn&#146;t find something well you can make a Interrupt OOC - say that Off/On The Edge looks nice... or with A Step Backwards... oh you need that key character that you just lost... well loose 3 randomly and go get him. Things like that. You don&#146;t have to complain that their undefeatable or that their a pain in the as.s... we know they are and no one really likes it, but that&#146;s the meta. I am thankful for the new card that pretty much hands Podracing its arse... and WYS for that matter as well, but granted I love WYS like alot of people, but I to realize that it&#146;s to powerful and needed some serious hurting to it... and now there is... As for Politics... think about put a couple of senators in your deck and go at &#146;em. Use the interrupt that allows you to put one of theirs back in their deck and one of yours... or use &quot;destiny adders&quot; and wipe them out. They all don&#146;t have that great of a forfit (except for Tikkes and Lott Dod)<br>
<br>
Essentially, all I am trying to say is quit your complainin&#146; and just run with the decks that you know are tride and true and tweak them against the meta that no one likes... Podracing and Senate and then you can continue your playing...<br>
<br>
As for another thing...people are starting to quit because of Defensive Cards... well I think that their own perogative but I won&#146;t quit till after the cards come out and then we can see how abusive they will be. We can&#146;t all judge a book by it&#146;s cover and when we do were usually wrong. Granted Decipher&#146;s made some HUGE mistakes with the game, but they&#146;ve also done a GREAT thing with the game. Their trying to rectify their problem, let&#146;s just be patient and see where it goes and try not to &quot;judge&quot; some cards before we see them all. It&#146;s only common sense to get upset with what we know so little about but once we see the whole thing then it makes better sense to us all.<br>
<br>
Again, sorry for the Rant Rave whatnot but please bear with me I didn&#146;t do it cause I don&#146;t love the game. I did it because alot of people are telling me stuff and I thought that I would essentially share it with you all.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
