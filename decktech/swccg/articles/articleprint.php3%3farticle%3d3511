<br>
Past, the present and the future<br>
<br>
Glimpse of the past<br>
Star wars ccg is one of the greasiest card games around. It requires skill, and ambition with cunning to be the best. As we seen from the past star wars does not favor the rich, or poor. It favors the one that knows its tools of the trade. The one that pushes the cards to its limit before they have to make a bullet cards. The one that makes you wonders how did they figure that out. In the past Hunters, Hayes, Chu stretches the cards to make them unbearable. <br>
3 years ago this game start with few people who had a dream of playing games without dices or luck. Decipher Inc. come out with a solution of ccg game that uses card control and side strategy. People came knocking at this game by the dozens. The more sets came out, the more people became happier. Kids of all ages, adults of all ages went to the tournaments. I remember walking in to a tournament and seen 14 to 25 people in tables and floors try to communicate. Card shops lined out to holds tournaments by the dozens. It gave away prizes like truckloads to players. Then it became down to 10 to 15 players but it was a regular player. These players consistently showed up and made efforts to promote this game. <br>
 <br>
The present:<br>
Like September 11, with the announcement of the lost of the contract to the evil wotc, people started to switch to lotrs by the dozen. Deciphers lost became peoples headache. What do I mean by this? Real simple, we got used to seen same amount of the people in the tournaments. We became friends. But after the contact dissolution people stop playing this game. They decided not to show up at all. Their simple reason was oh no more cards, or no more close tournaments. Tournament directors stop posting the tournaments or move them to undesirable times and dates. This made people switch to Lotr&amp;#8217;s and stop playing the game all together. I do not mind people switching to a different game or playing less but do not badmouth the game. It gave impression that the game was stupid from the beginning. I say, &amp;#8220;bull sh it.&amp;#8221; It entertained you for years. Suddenly sucks. Suddenly it is a crap. Hmm do not think so. <br>
<br>
The future:<br>
This game needs a major jolt to survive after the worlds this year. It needs a miracle in my view. I am a die-hard fan of this game. I traveled 1000 miles to play in a tournament; I spend paychecks after paychecks on this game. But, the reality of the game is that after the announcement of the contact the game lost its heart. It gave people reason to say good bye. One after another of the best players turned there back and said good bye. Do to this mass exude the game looks empty. Best names have been leaving for years but not all at once. We were able to replace those in short time. But now, it does not seem that we can anymore. The talent moved on. If the decipher gets the contact back like star trek, it might have a chance to bring it to glory. But the future does not look pleasant. There are fewer tournaments posted each month. Less competition in the game. I hope at least this year worlds will be the best that ever is.<br>
<br>
The last words from me are &amp;#8220;all good things must come to an end.&amp;#8221;<br>
<br>
Few quotes- I will not play the new star wars game. Absolutely not. It is against my principle to chance sides. I will try lotr and see where it goes. Long live the star wars ccg and its players who made this game what it is. <br>
