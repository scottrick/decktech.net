Many people have thrown in their two cents on how to make a good deck, how to use DeckTech, or how to write an article. However tournament reports seem to get short changed. I have a theory for why this occurs.<br>
<br>
Let's use DeckTech as our example. DeckTech has 4 main resource centers: Light Decks,	Dark Decks, Articles, and Tournament Reports. The members of this site post up a wide variety of material. The material posted up is geared toward tournament play. The decks and articles are all designed to help people prepare for upcoming tournaments, but tournament reports are the aftermath of tournaments. This presents the question, 'Who cares?'. Well, many people do. In fact, tournament reports include invaluable information (if written well) that cannot otherwise be obtained.<br>
<br>
For those who consider themselves 'bigger' than these kinds of articles: Okay, so there's no strategy for the game in here. I'm sorry. My advice to you is to click the little back arrow on your navigator and forget you ever saw this article.<br>
<br>
Many people who are members of DeckTech play in organized tournaments. They go to an event, have a reasonable or good performance, and decide they'd like to tell the world what happened. They write and submit a tournament report, thinking it will receive rave reviews, only to have people slap them in the face with reviews that complain about their report not having enough detail. Many times they say that the descriptions and accounts of the games are far too vague or short. They think, 'What else do I need to include?' This article will go over what a well crafted report should include.<br>
<br>
Part 1 - On Topic, But Not During Your Games<br>
<br>
You can't write a tournament report without attending a tournament. When going to a tournament you should make up your mind whether or not you are going to write a report on it *before* you start to play. If you decide to do so, pay more attention to detail. Here's a list of all the details you'll want to pick up that are outside your games:<br>
<br>
1) what kind of decks you are playing<br>
2) number of players<br>
3) name of Tournament Director<br>
4) name of winner<br>
5) what kind of decks the winner is playing<br>
<br>
Here's the logic behind each of these. You should let the people reading your report know exactly what it is you are playing. Describe each of your decks so that people can get an idea of what you're working with. It is not necessary to provide a list of the cards in the decks, but it can make this process much easier. Next, letting people know how many players there were helps people know how popular the game is in your area. It also helps people put in perspective on how well you did (coming in fifth out of 30 is a lot better than fifth out of 8). The third item no one likes but me. I think it is important to list the name of the TD, if it is a local tournament (note I don't think it's necessary to get the name of the TDs at a big tourney like DecipherCon or Origins). When you list the name of the local TDs you give them a little bit of credit that they deserve. Also, if someone in your area who doesn't go to tournaments reads your report, he can contact the TD and ask about the tournaments, get directions to the place you play at, etc. Lastly, should you not be the winner, it is good to list who the winner was and the decks they were playing. This is key, since people like to see what is working and what is effective in different regions. The first three items should be at the beginning of the report, and the last two should be at the end.<br>
<br>
Part 2 - On Topic, During Your Games<br>
<br>
This is the meat of your report. It is very important that you remember the actions of the game that shaped it and made it what it was. Just like in any essay, each game should have:<br>
<br>
1) an introduction<br>
2) a body, and<br>
3) a conclusion<br>
<br>
First, the intro. Before you give the actual report on each game, you should put a title for each game. The following is a hypothetical title that could have been used in a tournament report, followed by the breakdown of what each part means.<br>
<br>
Game 3 - My DS vs. Mike Fitzgerald's Throne Room Revolver<br>
<br>
Game [game number]: My [side of the force] vs. [name of opponent]'s [general description of deck]<br>
<br>
If the tournament is going to have more than 4 games, in place of Game 3 you could put Round 2 Game 1. The idea behind a title is that it will give the reader an idea of what he's about to read. Notice it is not necessary to give a general description of your own deck since you should have done that beforehand (refer to Part 1 - On Topic, But Not During Your Games). It is also not necessary to list what side the opponent is playing since obviously whichever side you're playing, your opponent is playing the opposite. Generally it will give the reader a feel for what you're up against, as well as piece together some of the unwritten details (an Ops deck will pull out sites early on, a Hidden Base deck will pull out systems, etc.).<br>
<br>
Next comes the body. This is the action during each game. These descriptions are what make your report a report. Be sure to list actions such as large battles that cost one player a large amount of force, or small ones that cost a player a key character. Include details such as when a player flips an Objective, completes a Jedi Test, or successfully Senses/Alters an important card. Be sure to mention whether the opponent is saving force up, playing aggressively, or waiting for you to make a move. Tell whether you/your opponent is struggling, or if everything seems to be going according to plan. These are just examples of the actions you should probably list, as there are many others. Anything that has a major impact on the game should be included. However, you don't have to describe *everything*. It is not necessary to list all the cards your opponent loses to each of their force drains (and yes, I have seen it). If they lose a big card, list it. But listing them all is going a bit overboard. For the most part, you should be able to use your own judgment on what is important.<br>
<br>
As the game draws to a close, you need to be careful how you report the game. If it's close, be sure to be very descriptive. There's nothing worse than not knowing how someone did something that affected the game dramatically Example: 'The game was really close. But then he pulled the trick he's played on me a thousand times during play testing. I knew it was coming. I lose by 25.' Huh? Don't do this to people. It only frustrates them and will probably result it a poor rating for your report. Now if the game is a blowout in either direction, don't describe every agonizing detail. If you're on the winning side, it's just mean to rub it in to the opponent any further. If you're on the losing side, don't be so hard on yourself. You've learned from the experience (hopefully) and you'll do better next time.<br>
<br>
Now for the conclusion. When concluding you want to put down 5 key things:<br>
<br>
1) who won<br>
2) whether it was a full win or a timed win<br>
3) by how much differential<br>
4) your overall record in the tournament after that game<br>
5) your personal highlights and lowlights of the game<br>
<br>
Who won the game should be an obvious one. The next one is often implied, but it always help to put FW (for full win), TW (for timed win), FL (for full loss, not Florida), and TL (for timed loss). These are the same abbreviations that are used on tournament command cards, so they are pretty well known. The differential is important because it's basically the score of the game. Your overall record after that game is important because it gives the reader a way of seeing if you're dominating, making a comeback, or taking a slide. Your personal highlights and lowlights gives the reader a sense of what it felt like to play the game. The actual report was more of a biography. Your personal highs and lows serve as a sort of autobiography.<br>
<br>
Part 3 - Off Topic, Not During Your Games<br>
<br>
Okay, now that you've gotten your vital details under control, have a little fun with your report. Include some details that will make the reader smile or even laugh out loud. Tell a little anecdote at the very beginning of your report. For example, you could tell of your trip to the location where the event is occurring if it was eventful in someway. Also, in between each game you can add in a little flavor. For example, if someone in another game stands up and starts shouting, 'I just blew up the Executor! Woo hoo!', put it in your report. If the power goes out during a match and people start saying that their 'plan' is working perfectly and soon they'll have a 90 card reserve deck, put it in your report. If someone just locked their keys and all of their cards in their car, put it in your report. It's just to give your report a little life. The facts are important, but you also don't want to put your reader to sleep. Don't go overboard though, because it will start to get annoying after a while. Again, use your own judgment on where to draw the line.<br>
<br>
Part 4 - Finalizing Your Report<br>
<br>
One of the most important areas in finalizing your report is checking your spelling and grammar. There's nothing worse than a report with poor spelling and grammar. Be sure to spell lose correctly (although I hope you don't have to use the word often). Lose is not the same thing as loose! After typing a report, run a spell check through it. After that, go back and read through the report and make sure it says what you want it to say, and says it the right way. If it does, good for you. If it doesn't, change it around. If you do change it, be sure to run another spell check, just to be sure. One last thing on the topic of spelling. Be sure you spelled your opponents' names correctly. It's never fun to have your last name butchered, or in some cases your first name. If you aren't sure if you spelled it right, put a little (sp?) next to the name just to let people know.<br>
<br>
The next part has to do mostly with DeckTech submissions, and maybe submissions on other sites of this kind. Be sure to remove any and all HTML tags from your report. They occur when you type your report in a word processor program and then 'cut and paste' it to the submissions form. They commonly occur where there are quotes and apostrophes. I have seen many people complain about this, and often times they give a lower rating for the report as a result. I know they are not intentional, but just run through your report before clicking 'finish' to be sure that there aren't any there. (On a side note, I apologize for any such HTML tags that may be in this article.)<br>
<br>
The last thing you should do before submitting your report is to make sure that your report is properly spaced. Don't submit a report that's all in one big paragraph. It will make it much easier to read by adding in some blank lines. It will make it look more professional, and will be easier on the eyes of your readers. I have also seen members of DeckTech give lower ratings because of this, so it is important.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's about all there is to say. Your report, if written with care, should help people. If it doesn't do that, then you shouldn't even write it. From a DeckTech standpoint, a tournament report is one of the easiest ways to raise your rating. Ever since the new requirements for rating other people's submissions went into effect, getting high ratings on your own submissions has become a priority to many new members. Follow the steps above, and you will easily receive 4 stars on your next tournament report.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=448"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=448"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=448" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
