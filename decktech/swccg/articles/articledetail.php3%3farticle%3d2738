I found that out of the 800 Michigan players Decipher had ratings for, only 166 had played in the year 2001, and 100 of those had not played in over 2 months.  We never get 30 players at any one tournament.  ( I am not counting Grand Slams and Opens, nor am I counting state championships)  However, it is no wonder that we don&#146;t get large turnouts, because our player base is largely inactive.<br>
<br>
I made a few other observations after pouring over the Decipher regional ratings list.  Among my observations I noted that the top 10 players in Michigan have all participated in the tournament scene in 2001.  I wondered if the same could be said about the bottom 10.  I investigated and found that only 2 of the bottom 10 were active players.  Michigan is a fairly good sized state in area, but the majority of the population is centered around Detroit.  I found this to carry over to the Michigan SWCCG player base.  My final observation was that only 356 of the 800 players, a whopping 45%, had not bothered to play more than 6 games.<br>
<br>
I was beginning to come to a rather startling realization:  the Star Wars CCG tournament scene is very elitist.  We reward the best players, and ignore on the weaker players.  We fail to nurture new players, we crush them at every possible turn, and we give them nothing to take home with them afterwards.  I wanted to figure out how to change this.  I thought about it long and hard.  It didn&#146;t take me long to realize that brand new players have little chance of beating world-class players like Scott Diehl, Casey Galvan and Jeremiah Himmelbrand.  Even our most experienced players struggle to keep up with these gentlemen.  I asked myself, &quot;What will it take to keep players involved in the tournament scene?&quot;  <br>
<br>
As I considered the dilemma, I considered the chess world.  Patzers (scrubs) are not made to play grandmasters or experts in most tournaments.  The newbie will not have to worry about playing any of the top 1000 players in the world until he has attained the necessary skills.  The ccg world does not provide us the same luxury.  A newbie may have to play any number of outstanding players in his first tournament, especially in areas like Ballston, New York or Nashville, Tennessee.  Our sanctioned tournaments must all be &quot;open&quot; tournaments as mandated by Decipher.<br>
<br>
At this point, I pause to confess that I have been addicted to chess for years.  I began playing competitively after moving from Tennessee to Michigan.  Most of the chess tournaments that I play in have been sectioned tournaments, where players are grouped by rating.  However, I have played a few open tournaments.  In these open tournaments I remembered that I did have the overwhelming expereince of facing an International Master and having my kiester kicked.  Even after that initial game, though, I still had something to play for.  The prize funds were given by rating.  For example, there was a $100 prize for the top score for players rated under 1600 and a $50 prize for the second best score under 1600.  These of course are merely part of the total prize fund.  There are several different rating classes in chess, and they are usually under 2000, under 1800, under 1600, under 1400, under 1200, and under 1000.  I thought it would be cool if I could adapt this prize scheme to Star Wars and give my weakest players something to play for after they get crushed by the experts.<br>
<br>
The solution I came up with was based upon my individual circumstances.  I decided that first, I would set up a weekly tournament scene in Livonia, where 40 of our players lived.  I chose Livonia because it had a larger player base than any other city in Livonia, it was a suburb of Detroit, and I had a store owner there who was begging me to have weekly tournaments.  Second, I decided that the prizes sent by Decipher would have to be supplemented.  I talked the store owner into giving me the box toppers from Reflections 2 as she got them in.  Three prizes was still not enough for what I was envisioning.  I wanted to have one prize for every 5 people in attendance.  So I dipped into my collection.  <br>
<br>
Here is how I dispensed the aforementioned prizes: I gave one prize to the overall tournament winner.  I gave a prize to the top player under 1600.  If the tournament drew 20 players, then I included the foil box topper and a lightsber foil out of my personal collection.  These were distributed to the highest scoring players under 1500 and 1400.  Finally, if we drew 25 players I added in a prize for the top scoring player under 1800.  My plan is to include an under 1700 and under 1300 prizes when we draw 30 and 35 players respectively.<br>
<br>
The weekly tournament series was a huge success.  A total of 48 different player have participated in my tournaments in the last 6 weeks.  The biggest difference is seen at the lower end of the spectrum.  We currently have 3 players who are playing weekly with ratings under 1400.  We also have 3 other players whose ratings have been resurrected from below 1400 since the league began.    The league has drawn in several brand new players, and nearly every active Livonia player has participated this summer.  Many of our &quot;retired&quot; players have come back to the tournament scene and we now have 189 players in Michigan that have played since January 1st.  This reflects a 14% increase in our active player base in 2 less than 2 months.  In addtion, there are still 356 players with 6 games or fewer played indicating that the new players who were involved in these tournaments remained active.  Finally, the Michigan player base has increased to 810 players without further stagnation.<br>
<br>
You may not be a squadron member or a tournament director, but your opinion still counts.  If you find that a disturbing proportion of your local player base quits the game after their first tournament, then suggest a prize support plan to your local tournament director that rewards the new players, the young players and the weak players in addition to the experienced and older players.<br>
<br>
By the way, our attendance has increased from 8 to 29 players, and the average attendance increased from 8 to 20.<br>
