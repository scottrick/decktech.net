<br>
1) keep pressure on them by battling so they cannot flip, eventually winning key battles and keeping an overall force advantage.<br>
<br>
2) ignore them altogether and drain the living crap out of them.<br>
<br>
first off we'll adress what the typical ralltir deck is capable of.  generating tons of force early on in the game, setting up a solid defensive &quot;stronghold,&quot; and getting high destiny draws after flipped.  in addition to this, they force you to take action against them because of the force drain -1.  then there's always the &quot;get any card for 2 force&quot; part of the objective.  nuff said.<br>
<br>
the typical ralltir deck has contingencies for just about every kind of decktype that's available right now, and with Prepared Defenses it becomes less prone to bad draws (not getting other twi-lek's or effects), as well as thinning the deck out so you draw more cards that facilitate flipping the objective.<br>
<br>
i think that the best start a ralltir deck could possibly have (as far as effects go) would be Oppressive Enforcement/Imperial Arrest Order/Imperial Decree.  some of you might prefer the whole Mobilization Points thing, or even Secret Plans or whatever else.  going with this, let's look at how the ralltir deck's first few turns work, and then how it functions after that.<br>
<br>
turn one: low activation, deploy &lt;&gt; site from reserve, use IAO to deploy 1/0 docking bay from reserve, deploy a 2/0 location from hand, draw available force.<br>
<br>
turn two: anywhere from 6 to 9 force is available to the ralltir player, depending on the opponent's locations, then another 2/0 location, another &lt;&gt; site, another 1/0 docking bay.  save some force.  their hand size is probably around 12, and they've got about 4 force saved.<br>
<br>
turn three: 3rd AND 4th &lt;&gt; locations hit the table another 2/0.  they get about 16 force to work with this turn, most likely flipping their objective with 3 imperials and 2 atst's.  saving 2 force for barriers/reacts.<br>
<br>
turn four and later on:<br>
the ralltir player has a solid foothold on his planet, and can now use his objective to get any missing card that he needs to start breaking down your defenses, etc.<br>
<br>
this &quot;turn sequence&quot; is certainly not the case for all ralltir decks (especially when playing against decks that generate more force than they do early on).	this is just the average.<br>
<br>
so to combat ralltir, what do you need?  it's a very defensive deck that rely's on it's ability to move/battle on the opponent't turn.<br>
<br>
one card that really take advantage of this is Order to Engage.  if they're not willing to battle you, just sit there.  you'll be hitting them for 3 every turn, which will balance out their drains of 1/site.<br>
<br>
another one is Harc Seff.  sitting at one of their sites with a pile of rebels and order to engage, they won't fight you.  they won't kill Harc Seff unless they have a Trample.  Harc will reduce the drains at adjacent sites to 0.  BAM!  right there you're winning the drain race because of OTE.<br>
<br>
these cards actually present an alternate way to battle Ralltir, but the two main strategies i've listed already are:<br>
1) fight them as they go.  for every force they're activating, make sure you activate 2, and you'll be able to throwdown against them with as many mains/eloms/whatever you want.  as long as they don't flip too early, you won't have any trouble fighting them and winning.  if you're going to try fighting them, you'll probably need some stuff to stop their defenses, like Skywalkers/slip sliding away/beezer/romas lock/Sense.	these stop reacts and barriers.  mechanical failure is pretty good too, since it allows for a bigger beatdown once you've canceled their reacts.<br>
<br>
2) ignore them.  set up a BIG drain somewhere else, like at Obi-wan's hut with Ben/stick/proficiency/bomarrmonk you'll be hitting them for 4.  ralltir's effectiveness is against multiple small drains, not against one big drain of 4-5.  their defense against this is Imperial Decree, which can easily be shut down by Landing Claw or a big space beatdown.<br>
<br>
remember that if you're going to try the IGNORE strategy, be prepared for them to make incursions against your big drain site with Vader/tarkin/mara/tempestw/igar/ig-88, etc.  whatever it is, you have to have staying power against a very large destiny draw.  this is best accomplished with Bacta Tank, Docking and repair facilities, and Ben Kenobi.  Affect Mind works well too, especially against non-vader Ralltir decks that rely on Mara because of their fear of Uncontrollable Fury.<br>
<br>
so those are the &quot;ways to beat ralltir.&quot;  i've probably missed alot of availabe &quot;tech,&quot; but there's always some new junk out there.<br>
