<br>
1. If it is a deck that people are commonly using why get pissed at someone who is running a deck in a similar fashion?  i mean really how many &quot;original&quot; bhbm decks are out there right now?<br>
<br>
2. Read the strategy and look at the cards in the deck.  This is very important because not all players play the same so you might want to look at the cards and strategy and attempt to comprehend the way the deck runs.  If you can&#146;t you have a few options: 1. the deck is above your level and you shouldn&#146;t review it, 2. the deck is really bad and doesn&#146;t deserve to be on the site, if you don&#146;t know what to do, don&#146;t review it.<br>
<br>
3. Look at the players rating and past accomplishments.  Really if it&#146;s a deck posted by Clint Hays, it&#146;s probably gonna be pretty good and you should try to understand what they are going for, i mean if you look at steve brentsons new light deck he just posted it&#146;s completely different than any other decks i&#146;ve seen posted, and it probably won&#146;t work well for you, but the way steve plays it the deck is a machine.  Just cuz a deck isn&#146;t good for you doesn&#146;t mean the deck is not good.<br>
<br>
4. Come on, if a person only puts one emperor in a deck give them a break, not everyone is super rich and able to buy all their cards, but they still try to manage with what they have.  don&#146;t give a one star review cuz of only one emperor in a bhbm deck.<br>
<br>
I&#146;m not doing this article for points, and it&#146;s not whining about reviews on my decks that i&#146;ve gotten recently, i just want people on this site to be a little more aware and think a little harder when reviewing decks.<br>
<br>
At this point in the game, there are some strategies that are now impossible to make original.	Think an objective is made to have decks designed around it in a similar fashion.  so there are certain elements that need to be in every deck, then players individual playing style comes in.  this is a fact now in our objective based game.<br>

well that&#146;s it. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
