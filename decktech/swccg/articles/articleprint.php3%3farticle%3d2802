The senate and podracing helpers made the game even less interactive. As a result of these and other factors, Kyle Craft and many other people have quit or given thought about quitting Star Wars because it isn’t fun anymore. I tend to think that they’re right and that Decipher has made some pretty big mistakes. I’m not sure that if in playtesting they missed something or if they wanted the game to be played like this. <br>
Either way, I do not intend for this ‘article’ to be a rant.<br>
<br>
I think that a way to get this game back on track is to let Decipher know that we are disappointed with the way they’ve turned the game and give them suggestions on how to change it. By we I mean the SWCCG community.<br>
<br>
Now some of you are probably getting ready to hit the back button on your browser because your saying “Decipher’s not going to listen to a couple of people telling them how to run their game” but I’m not talking about a couple people. I’m hoping that by the time this is through, I will have over 500 suggestions for Decipher. Here’s how my friends and I have put this together:<br>
<br>
I will be sending out an email to Decipher (hopefully within the week) of the comments from players regarding how we think the game should be changed and kept the same. To post a comment, Put it on the reviews page<br>
<br>
Dear SWCCG Decipher staff,<br>
<br>
‘Let them know what you are disappointed about in the way they’ve changed the game in the last couple of expansions (i.e. podracing, senate, watto’s box, etc.). Don’t complain and rant the whole time, though. (no one ever responds to pure criticism well.) Also let them know what you think they’ve done well in SWCCG. Any extra thoughts on what you want to see in R3 (a little too late though) and Theed Palace and any other expansions in the future.’<br>

I really think that this will get Decipher listening, if there are enough submissions.<br>
<br>
Here’s an example of a letter (MINE) below:<br>
<br>
Dear SWCCG Staff,<br>
I am glad to see that you guys are making new sets and trying to expand the complexity of the game. Many people, including myself, don’t like the way the current Meta is. In the DS, podracing is way too powerful. Winning a Podrace for the Dark Side has more advantages then crossing over Obi-wan to the Dark side. And the senate encourages non-interactive play in games and that isn’t fun for anyone. My personal suggestions would be to somehow make podracing less of a factor in games and to make some one playing senate to have to be more interactive. I do, though, like the new personas of Maul and Qui-Gon w/ they’re weapons. They are almost totally balanced in my mind with Qui-Gon being able to draw extra Battle Destiny against Maul and Maul being able to swing twice(good thing the Phantom Menace can be cancelled by OOC!!!). In the upcoming expansions, I hope that you get more battling and force draining into the game instead of so much direct damage (Visage, racing, Senate, etc.). Thnaks for making such a good game and impress us with your new sets.<br>

If a lot of people wrote these kinds of letters, then Decipher will get a feel for what the players want and how to attract new players and keep old ones. <br>
<br>
And those of you ready to give me a 1 star because this isn’t a true article… If you want to have many more articles to rate then you’d better fill out a letter or there won’t be any more articles. <br>
<br>
I want to stay in this game and have many more expansions come out (at a slower pace hopefully) and enjoy this game w/out having to worry about Sebulba’s pod every time. And, hey, if this works, then Decipher won’t have to make as many cheap sets because we’re all buying a ton of the good ones.<br>

P.S. Give this as high a rating as you possibly can let yourself so that more people will see this. Thanks.<br>
