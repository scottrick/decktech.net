Recently I have witnessed an issue that I think all of you should be aware of. At local tournaments in the tatooine region I have noticed an increase in &quot;sleight of hand&quot; or cheating. I am not blaming the tournament directors for this I am blaming the cheaters. When it first happened to me I didn&amp;#8217;t know whatr to do about it, I talked to the player, he denied it and I let it slide watching carefully for the rest of the game. The kid took first place at the tournement and that made me angry. I asked the tournament director later how to deal with cheaters and he said that no matter what if you suspect someone of cheating call over the tournament director and explain the situation. You can even ask the director to watch the rest of the game. Don&amp;#8217;t let any player intimadate you, call him on it. Cheaters are a black stain on the good name of the game. But there is also another side to this story, don&amp;#8217;t go overboard and accuse anyone for anything. If they make a mistake it&amp;#8217;s not cheating explain to them the rules do not try and get them disqualifed. If you are a cheater and are reading this be warned I will not stand for it and I hope nobody else will. To win a game by cheating is not truly winning, the second you cheat you are admitting defeat to your opponet, you are saying &quot;I cannot win but want to so I better cheat&quot;. This ruins the game for all players. Who wants to pay 5$ to play at a tournament and get low prize support when a cheater walks off with first place. I&amp;#8217;m urging all players to be aware of this issue and to help put a stop to cheating permanately. If enough people lose interest in the game because they lose to cheaters, players as a whole will suffer and if enough quit the game will end. Thank you for taking the time to read this article i hope you learned something and will now be more aware of everything. Don&amp;#8217;t let the actions of a few ruin the game for all. <br>

Cantonavader said :&quot;I hear you brother. This s h i t happened to me at TN states one time with a mysterious 6 destiny and an inaccurate card count. On top of this you must always know how much force you opponent is activating and exactly how many cards they have in their hands. (Make them count face down if necessary or even ask to count them yourself) <br>
<br>
Also beware of people who recirculate too fast without paying UPKEEP on the new cards. I played in a prerelease in KY where it cost me 1st place after forgetting to pay upkeep on a new Boba Fett. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Good point now that RF3 is coming ou you need to be aware of upkeep violations, don&#146;t let them get away with this back them up if you have to.<br>

Destab said:&quot;numbers, operatives and asteroids are a black stain on the good name of the game...cheaters are a part of life. learn how to cope, ya puss.&quot;<br>
<br>
first off I&#146;m not a puss and cheaters dont have to be a part of life if we are aware that is the point of this article to inform.<br>

TheReverend said:&quot; I would have given you 5 stars, but the article needed to be in more depth, longer, and pertain to the game more than the rant that you did post. <br>
You should have gone through the steps of the situation, what you did, explanations of what you did that was wrong, and how to rectify that for the next situation. <br>
Cheaters are a blight upon the CCG industry. There will always be cheaters. That will never change. But, to have a zero tolerance policy on it is a good thing. I for one do not want these wastes of flesh playing in my tournaments. <br>
I am a TD, and if I find out a player is cheating, then I watch every game they are playing after that first complaint. I also give them a warning, next they are kicked out with the knowledge that if they cheat one more time in the tournament I will take the matter up with decipher and it could possibly mean his being banned from the tournaments that I run.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know it neede to be longer that&#146;s why I am doing this thank you for your input. The steps of the situation are I saw this kid look at cards he was activating and slide the ones he didn&#146;t want back into his reserve deck. I told him not to do it again he played dumb said he didn&#146;t know what I was talking about and I let it slide. My mistake was letting it slide, i should have called over the TD and explained the situation and askec him to watch the rest of my game if I still had doubts. I&#146;m not trying to rant just inform sorry if it sounds that way that is not my intention.<br>

Rypcord said:&quot;Write it out more. Check your spelling and punctuation {every &quot;i&quot; should be I.} <br>
Also, just don&amp;#8217;t rant, give good information. <br>
...Yes cheaters should die, but just don&amp;#8217;t rant, give us some good information. <br>
+1 Star for being Down against Cheaters.&quot;<br>
<br>
I fixed the &quot;I&quot; problem sorry about that and I am not ranting let me quote myself and explain the whole article: &quot;It&#146;s not he won the game cheating, it&#146;s that he cheated to win the game.&quot; Basically that&#146;s saying I&#146;m not pissed I lost I&#146;m pissed he cheated.<br>

<br>

Ways To Cheat:<br>
Ways people cheat are not losing enough force, never let your opponet lose force in chunks make him count it and if you don&#146;t believe him count it yourself. Big power battles, If your opponet seems to have to haigh of a power in a game count it yourself, you don&#146;t have to believe him. Missing hand, don&#146;t let your opponet put his hand down next to his other piles he will then lift up all the piles trying to find his hand and may not even end up with the same hand. Shuffle cut and replace. Always cut your opponets deck after he looks through it, there is no excuse for not doing it so just do it. <br>
