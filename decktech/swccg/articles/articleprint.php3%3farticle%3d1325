After the many years of playing this wonderful game I have come again to a full circle. I started out as did everyone else in the game, I had nothing to really start with and my biggest character was Luke Skywalker, well that's fine and dandy. I sat down, read the rules...re-read the attrition rules...and then read them again (I didn't get it the first couple of times) when I finally did and started playing the game I got together with some friends and we played. We loved this game (still do) and have gone on to better and greater deck concepts, essentially what this article is about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now some people will have the resources to buy all the cards that they want while others will trade away their bigger cards (Darth Vader etc.) for smaller cards. I belive that its a great way to get some of the cards that you want. But what I have learned that this game is not based on power of the characters, or the amount of money you have for the game. You can win this game if you keep to a single strategy (in the beginning) for example one of my all time favorite decks is my UTINNI, Revenge of a Jawa (located @ http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/catsstarwars/index.html under the Decks catagory) this deck only has a few rares of which they are not that powerful, however when theyre in a more streamlined enviornment they are viscious. Never underestimate a Jawa. Now granted that this is not a Tournament deck (however I have played it before and won) it is a fun deck to give the beginning player an emphasis of the game. Every card in this deck has a purpose (yes even that Rebel Guard). From the smallest detail to the largest, this deck has alot to offer especially to a beginning player.&lt;br&gt;With time, you can ascend the ladder of card creating ability and do more than one thing at a time, and I hope that you all become great star wars players. But always remember that its not the cards that make the person its the knowledge that you have and the understanding of the game. If a one time ranked 9th in the world player can beat you with a Jawa deck, then its high time you go back to your deck and see where it went wrong. Its not that I am a good player (any more) its just I know my deck. Always play test your decks against your other decks. (Now I know your thinking...play against myself) yes, play against yourself dont cheat yourself and play like you normally would. See how many turns it takes to get out the cards that you need...play it and learn it then you will know all the quirks of the deck and wont have to worry about loosing to someone with their Jawa deck. The final key that I have learned is that *TECH* is what helps win. I used to think that it was just sheer power and having all the cards to use when I wanted was what made me a good player, recently a year or so ago I found that having all the key cards didnt help me like I thought I would. I find myself using cards that I never thought that I would. Just remember when your making a deck dont just make it for sheer power and beat down, make the deck with *TECH* use those 1 or 2 cards that maybe completely useless against your opponent if hes not playing the right deck, however when you do encounter that one person and you have them...hell be blown away with envy that you used it but it will also show that you thought ahead...the perfect example all my Light Side decks carry at least 1 Transmission Terminated, as you know that cancels out Visage Of The Emperor. Now most Hunt Down decks have more than 1 but, if you get that one and use it early you can stop that harsh force loss that you may not be able to afford. I know your thinking yeah well I allready do that just go through all your cards and look at them and see some of them that were once useless are now quite usefull. They always were we were just blind to see that and I hope that this opened your eyes. I know it did mine.<br>
