<br>
     You may be wondering why I wrote this. Lemme ask you one question: How would you like to have several characters that deploy for free and are power 3, 4, 5, even 6? Some others that are deploy 1, power 3, 4, 5, and 6? How about one that deploys for free, power 6, and has it's own matching saber? These combos only require a couple of cards. The cards aren't rare, just overlooked. I felt a need to write this article after realizing that not only am I the only person in the world who uses Nightfall and Sunsdown, but that these 2 cards are, in my opinion, the most underestimated cards in the game. And they only get better with further expansion sets. In this article, my goal is to at least get you to think a little higher of nighttime conditions, and maybe even get you to use them in your decks. You will soon (hopefully) see that nighttime conditions are much more powerful than you realize.<br>
<br>
     First off, the text of both Nightfall and Sunsdown:<br>
<br>
Deploy on any planet system to cause &quot;nighttime<br>
conditions&quot; at related sites. During battles there,<br>
both sides add one destiny to power only. Spies<br>
deploy free to sites under &quot;nighttime conditions.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Now I'll go through the benefits of Nightfall (LS), then Sunsdown (DS).<br>
<br>
Nightfall<br>
<br>
     Deploy on any planet system. Hardly a restriction. The extra destiny to power is nice, assuming your destinies are high. However, both sides get the extra destiny, so the opponent may use this against you. So far, Nightfall almost seems bad for you to use. But we're just getting started.<br>
<br>
     Spies deploy free to sites under nighttime conditions. Hmmm... what are some LS spies? Cracken, Blount, Leia Organa, Tanus Spijek, Tamtel Skreej, Artoo, R2-D2, Boussh, TK-422, Bothan Spy, Jeroen Webb, Wyron Serper, Momaw Nadon... there may be a couple I missed. But still, you probably use at least one of these. And if you don't, imagine if you did. Imagine deploying all these to the same site for free. Or different sites, so you can spread out and drain for only a handful of Force. You're saving tons of Force by deploying them for free. Keep in mind that this just requires one card, Nightfall. Heck, at the Sandcrawler sites, nighttime conditions already exist.<br>
<br>
     Then there's the cards that benefit from nighttime conditions in their game text. These include Arcona, Talz, Snivvian, Melas, Tooex, and probably some other cards I can't remember.<br>
<br>
     Arcona, as we all should know, can sit and drain without fear of being battled, unless opponent uses CZ-4, Nemet, Pinned Down, etc. Arcona gets a power +1 bonus from nighttime conditions, but I doubt he'll be battling, unless Tooex is involved...<br>
<br>
     Talz is power +2 under nighttime conditions. So now he's deploy 1, forfeit 4, power 3, and can forfeit in place of a character hit by a weapon. Not bad, not bad at all. Just keep him with Ben Kenobi, and your characters are safe from almost anything. Throw in Delevar, FX-7, Bacta Tank, Redemtion, and 2-1B, and now you have an awesome combo... that belongs in a different article. For this one let's stick to the fact that he's deploy 1, forfeit 4, power 3.<br>
<br>
     Snivvian is a must-have in any Nightfall deck. Power +2 under nighttime conditions, he becomes deploy 2, forfeit 2, and power 3. Not too bad, but his text is where it counts. First, he can deploy as a react. Handy. Then, if Nightfall is cancelled at the related system, it goes to Used Pile and you retrieve 2 Force. The only cards that can cancel Nightfall that I know of are Ghhhk and Alter. Just pack Control, Sense, or just a Snivvian or 2 or 3 or a bunch, and you're covered.<br>
<br>
     Melas is always cool at power 2 ability 4. But under nighttime conditions, he's power +2, which makes him power 4 ability 4. Pretty good for a nobody.<br>
<br>
     Tooex is a droid. Deploy 2, forfeit 2, power 0. Well geez, that's not good. But check out the text. Under nighttime conditions, your Rebels and aliens present are power +2 and, if present with a Vaporator, immune to attrition &lt;3. Whoa... your Talzes are now power 5, deploy 1. Snivvians are deploy 2, power 5, and remember that they can deploy as a react. Melas is power 6, Arcona 4... wait, I just thought of something. For 2 Force, you can have loads of power. Just have Nightfall, Tooex, and some spies... deploy Tooex and Nightfall for 2 Force, then deploy the spies for free which are each power +2. Leia Organa is deploy free, power 5! Same for Tamtel. Even a lowly Bothan Spy is deploy free, power 3. Throw in a Vap and they're immune to atrrition &lt;3. Also, keep in mind that Tooex is non-unique. Just have one at every site that's under nighttime conditions, and you're in business. Keep in mind those spies that deploy for free...<br>
<br>
     Now we've discovered the power of Nightfall. Some tips: throw in Bargaining Table for all those Arconas, Talzes, and Snivvians. Maybe throw in the Jundland Wastes, Ardon Crell, some Vaps, Hydros, Owen and Beru, Master Luke, and Ben Kenobi. Oh yeah, throw in Cantina. Your aliens are power +1 there. With Nightfall and Tooex at the Cantina, Melas is power 7, Talz is power 6 (deploy 1), etc... add maybe Beru Stew. If they battle, use it, activate a bunch, deploy a buncha Snivvians as a react. Ah, one more thing. Arleil Schous. Makes your aliens deploy -1 at same an adjacent Tatooine sites. Talz now deploys for free, Snivvian is deploy 1 (now you can deploy twice as many as a react!)... so in a situation with the Cantina, Tooex, Nightfall, and Arleil Schous, Talz is deploy free, power 6! Snivvian deploy 1, power 6, spies deloy free, power at least +2... etc. Now add CZ-3 so you can react with all these things not to mention those spies (and Talzes with Arliel Schous) for free! Tatooine sounds good for Nightfall, doesn't it? With Arleil Schous, Vaps, Cantina ... we could make a deck right now, but I'll do that later.<br>
<br>
Sunsdown<br>
<br>
     To me, nighttime conditions offers less for the DS than for the LS. Others disagree. It certainly has more in the way of Effects, but not in characters.<br>
<br>
     Spies deploy free. Some DS spies include Sarkli, Labria, Mara Jade, J'Quille, 5D6, Garindan, U-3PO, Tonnika Sisters, Probe Droid, Murtocc Yine, Fozec, ISB agents... and maybe some others I forgot. You probably use at least one of these... and if you didn't, imagine if you did. You could save a lot of Force deploying these guys for free instead of for what they normally go for.<br>
<br>
     Then there's the cards that benefit from nighttime conditions in their text. These include Macroscan, Defel, Whiphid, Frostbite, Makurth, 5-D6, Tooex, and maybe some others I forgot.<br>
<br>
     Macroscan is a card that allows you to glance at the top card of the opponent's Reserve at any time by using 1 Force. However, if nighttime conditions exist on table, you get to peek at the top 3 cards! Not bad.<br>
I can certainly think of some situations where this would come in handy...<br>
<br>
     Defel is an alien, deploy 3, forfeit 2, power 3, ability 1. The main thing is that under nighttime conditions he can hide (not participate in) a battle by using 1 Force. Thus, he can sit there, and if LS battles just hide and the battle's cancelled. This can be cancelled by Nice Of You Guys To Drop By (among other things), but don't tell anybody...<br>
<br>
     Whiphid is power 3, deploy 4, forfeit ONE. Ouch... however, he's forfeit +2 under nighttime conditions. That helps... a little. He also has the &quot;if Sunsdown is canceled at the related system, it goes to Used Pile and you retrieve 2 Force&quot; ability. The only cads that can cancel Sunsdown that I know of are Houjix and Alter. Whiphid is also power +2 on Hoth... as is J'Quille the spy. Hmmm... so far, Sunsdown seems best on Hoth. More on that later.<br>
<br>
     2X-3PKR (Tooex) is the DS version of the Tooex above. The only difference is that the immunity to attrition &lt;3 applies without a Vap. It makes those Whiphids power 7 on Hoth! But deploy 4... dang. However, Mara Jade becomes deploy 0, power 6, power 8 with the Emperor ... not bad at all! J'Quille is deploy 0 power 8 and can exclude a character with ability &lt;3... geez, that's awesome!<br>
<br>
     Frostbite is an Effect that deploys on Hoth. Here's what it does:<br>
<br>
Deploy on Hoth system. At the end of each player's<br>
turn, for every character that player has present at a<br>
marker site under &quot;nighttime conditions,&quot; that player<br>
must lose 1 Force (2 if character is missing).<br>
<br>
Ouch... BOTH players lose Force. So, you have to somehow get more of their characters on Hoth than you. Or make their characters missing. Or use a lot of walkers... So I guess Hoth is the system of choice for Sunsdown given Frostbite, Whiphids, and J'Quille. Of course, you could argue for Tatooine given Scum And Villainy, Chall Bekan, Cantina, etc... but I think the power bonus for Whiphid and J'Quille + Frostbite just give Hoth a little edge.<br>
<br>
     Makurth is a fixed card which gets immunity to atrrition &lt;4 under nighttime conditions. It may also add one destiny to power only by using 2 Force (1 if you initiated the battle). It doesn't get much for nighttime conditions, but at least it's something. It's also deploy 2, forfeit 2, power 2, ability 1. Not bad... not really bad anyway...<br>
<br>
     5-D6 deploys for free under nighttime conditions. His text also says that he's immune to attrition under nighttime conditions. Geez... not &lt;2, &lt;3, &lt;4, &lt;5... just all attrition! Not too bad...<br>
<br>
     We've now discussed the power of Sunsdown. I don't think it's as powerful as Nightfall, but it helps. Keep in mind those spies that deploy for free... how many times do I have to say that? Tips: Throw in Den Of Thieves for Makurth and Whiphids... have some AT-ATs, maybe Walker Garrison. Remember all those spies... maybe Undercover... note that for LS above too... Mara Jade's saber... Nevar Yalnal maybe? I dunno... I can't think of too many things for DS... oh well.<br>
<br>
     That's about it. I know I got you at least thinking about nighttime conditions... maybe not the way I intended, but you're thinking about it. Hopefully you've realized it's power, maybe you'll use it in a deck (ISB comes to mind... so does Tat drain and Walker Garrison... of course you could put it in any deck and it's likely to have a good effect) and if you do, hopefully I've helped you with the deckbuilding a little. Also remember that nighttime conditions are extremely easy to set up. In fact, all you have to do is start with it using The Signal or Twilek Advisor and you've got it covered! Nighttime conditions is probably the easiest combo to set up. Just deploy the Effect, and in the right deck the that's all you need. The characters will come easily.<br>
