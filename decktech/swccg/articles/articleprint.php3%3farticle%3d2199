<br>
     I&#146;m sure you&#146;ve read some of the typical &quot;Shoebox Cards&quot; articles. But this one&#146;s different. Why? First of all, in some of these articles they&#146;ll feature cards that people already use, like Grimtaash or X-wings or whatever. The author of that article may think these cards are cool, and thinks that nobody else uses them, but people do use them. However, this particular article features cards that nobody uses. I mean really hardly anybody... the only people that use these cards are either newbies who don&#146;t have that many cards to choose from anyway, or those select few people that have discovered the tech in these cards. The second reason why this article is different is because each of these cards is actually good. For example, Send A Detachment Down. Nobody uses it, but is it a good card? No. The card is useless, one of the worst rares in the game. But someone might mention it in a &quot;Shoebox Cards&quot; article, just because nobody uses it, regardless of how good it is. What good is the article if all I&#146;m doing is making a list of bad cards you don&#146;t use? What I&#146;m trying to do with this article is bring to your attention cards that not only aren&#146;t used by many people, but are also good.<br>

     Imbalance<br>
<br>
Destiny 4 Used Interrupt. Text:<br>
<br>
If opponent just retrieved Force, opponent must lose X Force, where X = one-half the number of cards retrieved (round up).<br>
<br>
One of the cards I&#146;m always sure to include in my deck. It&#146;s destiny 4, which is good. And it&#146;s a Used Interrupt, which is really good. And it makes the opponent lose Force. So it&#146;s a high destiny Used Interrupt that makes the opponent lose Force. How many of those are there? Why don&#146;t more people use this card? Almost every, if not every, LS retrieves Force. Whether it&#146;s by Figrin D&#146;an, Kessel Run, Draw Their Fire, Tatooine Celebration, Nar Shaadaa Wind Chimes, Our Most Desperate Hour, On The Edge, Off The Edge, Death Star Plans, or any other retrieving card. The LS retrieves a lot. When you use this card, they have to lose half of that Force they just retrieved. Did they just retrieve 8 Force? Use this, they lose 4 Force. Did Profit or MWYHL just flip, and they retrieved 10 Force? Use this, and they have to lose 5 Force. The best part is that since it&#146;s a Used Interrupt, you can use this card several times in a game. The opponent gets frustrated when one card, a Used Interrupt nonetheless, is making them lose so much Force. And this card only gets so much better with Secret Plans. This really aggravates the opponent, because now they not only have to use Force to retrieve Force, but when they retrieve you just use this and they lose Force. How can you not like this card?<br>

     BG-J38<br>
<br>
Destiny 4 maintenance droid, deploy 2, forfeit 2, power 1. Text:<br>
<br>
May add 2 to the destiny of each of your holograms and dejariks drawn for battle destiny or weapon destiny. While at a site you control, adds 1 to power of each of your dejariks and holograms at a holosite.<br>
<br>
Let&#146;s start with a list of Light Side dejariks and holograms:<br>
<br>
Critical Error Revealed<br>
Help Me Obi-Wan Kenobi<br>
Houjix<br>
Grimtaash<br>
K&#146;lor&#146;slug<br>
Mantellian Savrip<br>
Projection Of A Skywalker<br>
<br>
Houjix and POAS are popular, Mantellian Savrip and Grintaash are used in a number of decks too. The others only see occasional if any use. One gripe about Houjix is that it&#146;s destiny 1. BG-J38 makes it destiny 3, about average. POAS goes from an already good destiny 5 to a whopping destiny 7! Grimtaash becomes a good 4, Mantellian Savrip becomes a good 5. I personally use something like 1-3 Houjixes, 1-2 POAS, and maybe a Mantellian Savrip or Grimtaash in my decks. So BG-J38 is pretty handy, possibly effecting a fairly large portion of my deck, making my destinies even higher. And he&#146;s a maintenance droid, so he can even be pulled with Echo Base Garrison. He&#146;s a destiny 4 himself, not bad at all. Check your deck and see how many dejariks or holograms you use. Another trick with him is playing with the Dejarik Hologameboard. The opponent might try to be smart and deploy a Ghhhk there, thinking he&#146;ll drain for 2 there the rest of the game. You just deploy BG-J38, a few dejariks to the site, and beatdown, remembering that each of the dejariks in the battle is power +1. Overall a pretty decent card, even if it&#146;s only good in a deck with a few dejariks or holograms.<br>
<br>
     Droid Detector<br>
<br>
Destiny 5 device. Text:<br>
<br>
Deploy at any interior site. Cannot be moved. All droids present must move away by the end of opponent&#146;s next turn, or they are lost. Droids may not deploy to same site and are lost if present at end of any turn.<br>
<br>
Who hates A Gift? Sure, Sniper can get rid of it, and Lt. Pol Treidum can stop it. But there are some disadvantages to those. Sniper requires a character with a weapon during your control phase. It&#146;s also a Lost Interrupt, destiny 3, only destiny 2 if you use the combo. Lt. Pol Treidum is an Imperial, so already he doesn&#146;t mesh well with a Scum deck. And it&#146;s required for him to be at the site. And there&#146;s counters to that, and to Sniper. With Droid Detector, you don&#146;t need anybody at any site. Just deploy it to the Audience Chamber. There are three possibilities:<br>
<br>
1. Artoo is at the adjacent site. In this case, the opponent still needs to move Artoo there. They move him there, then at the end of their turn Artoo is lost. A Gift is only on table for 2 phases. Some may say that Undercover spies aren&#146;t present... you&#146;re wrong. Look it up. Undercover spies never provide presence, but they are present, they are &#146;at&#146; the site, this is what makes Droid Detector work.<br>
<br>
2. Artoo is already at the Audience Chamber with A Gift, but opponent hasn&#146;t saved any Force. Simple. Just deploy Droid Detector to the Audience Chamber, at the end of your turn, Artoo is lost. No characters or anything required.<br>
<br>
3. Artoo is already at the Audience Chamber with A Gift, and opponent has saved a Force, so he can move away. All you have to do is keep Artoo from moving away. How? Bib Fortuna. Opponent&#146;s characters at same site as Bib of ability &lt;4 can&#146;t move from same site to a Jabba&#146;s Palace site. Just make sure the adjacent site is Tatooine: Jabba&#146;s Palace. Now Artoo can&#146;t move away, and is lost, along with A Gift, at the end of your turn.<br>
<br>
No matter what, Artoo (or whatever droid they use) and A Gift are lost. But this card has more uses than that. Against RTP, deploy it to the Yavin 4: Docking Bay. 8D8 can&#146;t deploy there now, and if opponent isn&#146;t careful, 8D8 is screwed. Does the WED-9-M1 &#146;Bantha&#146; Droid keep canceling your Lateral Damage? Kill it with the Detector, and next turn your Lateral Damage is safe. And for a stretch, it can be used as a counter against LIN-V8K, the mining droid. If the opponent plays mines (hey, it&#146;s happened a lot to me) it can get really annoying, and screw your deck over if you&#146;re playing on the ground. Just use this, and you have one site safe. But, it&#146;s non-unique... so if you want, just deploy one of these to each of your interior sites, and you&#146;re safe. And also since it&#146;s non-unique, against an RTP deck just deploy one to each of the Yavin 4 sites, and 8D8 can never be deployed. However you use it, the Droid Detector can come in handy.<br>
     <br>
     Han<br>
<br>
Destiny 1 alien, deploy 4, forfeit 3, power 2, ability 2, pilot, gambler. No text.<br>
<br>
Why is this card good? It appears that he&#146;s really useless, but he&#146;s not. He&#146;s an alien, the only Han that is an alien. This means you can use Bo Shuda and Uh-Oh! with him. And since he&#146;s power &lt;4, you retrieve 10 instead of 5 with Profit. Being an alien can make him the best Han for Profit. You can just sit at the Audience Chamber with him, Rennek, a Worrt, and Bo Shuda with Order To Engage and Uh-Oh! out. The opponent has to lose 3 Force every turn, and there&#146;s nothing they can do about it. Worrt makes them unable to move, and Rennek doesn&#146;t let Worrt attack. Han just sits back and grins. I guess this card is really only good in a Profit deck, besides that I can only see this card being used as a quasi-counter against a heavy SCrew (only targets Rebels) deck, or something weird like that.<br>
     <br>
     Han&#146;s Toolkit<br>
<br>
Destiny 4 device. Text:<br>
<br>
Use 1 force to deploy on one of you characters, vehicles or starships (free if on the Millennium Falcon or Han). While aboard a vehicle or starship, you may use 1 force to cancel any interrupt or effect which targets that vehicle or starship.<br>
<br>
Raise your hand if you hate Lateral Damage. This card cancels it, easily. Sure, you could just use Alter, but that requires a destiny draw, some players play the SAC killer combo card, Sense cancels your Alter, so does Control, etc. This card lets you cancel Lateral Damage really easily, no fuss. Is Tallon Roll a problem? Not any more. Gravity Shadow? Besieged? Any other cards? Not a problem, this card cancels them too. The Super Falcon, Outrider, Home One, etc., only get better with this card.<br>
<br>
     Aim High<br>
<br>
Destiny 3 Effect. Text:<br>
<br>
Deploy on table. When you fire two weapons (except lightsabers) in a battle, your total power is +5. Also, whenever opponent retrieves X cards, opponent must first use X Force or that retrieval is canceled. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
First of all, you can start with this and 2 other Effects with Heading For The Medical Frigate since it deploys on table for free and is always immune to Alter. The first function is kind of lackluster, though it could be good in some decks. One thing to remember is that it works in space too. The function, while not broken, is still a nice addition to the card, you never know when 5 more power will come in handy. The second function is what really counts. This is why Secret Plans sees a lot of use, or at least it should. People have said that the LS retrieves more than the DS. That may be true, but by no means does the DS not retrieve. The DS definitely retrieves. Check your dark deck right now, and see how many cards retrieve. Scum And Villainy and First Strike are seeing more use than ever, and after they&#146;ve been used several times in a game, that&#146;s a lot of retrieval. Not to mention all the other cards that retrieve too. Trust me, the DS retrieves a lot, you might be surprised how much of an effect this card has in a game. It should see more use than it does.<br>
<br>
     Try looking through your commons/uncommons for other hidden gems. There&#146;s a lot more out there. Some other cards to look into are Gravity Shadow (Kessel Run and OMDH counter, among other things, great card for trackmasters), Barquin D&#146;an (remember, he makes himself +1 because he&#146;s a gambler), J&#146;Quille (built-in exclusion), Rappertunie (built-in power=0 text), Main Course (cancel Frozen Assets or reduce opponent&#146;s power and attrition), Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son (answers the question of what to do with those Droid Detectors in the end-game, among other cards) and lots of others. Before I wrote this article I planned on listing the card How Did We Get Into This Mess? But then there was the DPC... I guess people realize the power of that card now. And think, there&#146;s other cards like that out there. Cool, major tournament winning common cards that you just don&#146;t know about. Scary thought.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
