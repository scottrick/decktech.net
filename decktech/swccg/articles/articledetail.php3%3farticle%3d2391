<br>
So you&#146;ve read the other articles and want to know what happens next. Here are the possible situations you could be in:<br>
<br>
a) You&#146;ve never read my previous tracking articles<br>
b) You&#146;ve read the tracking articles, but haven&#146;t tried / mastered the techniques yet<br>
c) You&#146;ve read the tracking articles, practiced, and now you are a tracking beast<br>
d) You&#146;ve read the tracking articles and don&#146;t give a rat&#146;s behind because it&#146;s all old news to you<br>
<br>
If you&#146;re not in group c or d, you should probably stop reading now because you WILL be lost. With a select few exceptions, this will prove to be true. Make sure you can track your deck from the top and from the bottom before you attempt the advanced strategies within this document. I&#146;m writing this in the hopes of making group c MUCH better players, and maybe even reaching to group d this time around.<br>
<br>
I&#146;ll give you a list of cards that can vastly improve on tracking skills and are useful in gameplay, then I&#146;ll give a few examples on how to use them effectively. Maybe in the process I&#146;ll give you some tech you didn&#146;t have before that you can implement into your play style.<br>
<br>
CARDS YOU NEED IN EVERY LIGHT DECK:<br>
I can&#146;t think of a single Light deck that couldn&#146;t be improved with these cards.<br>
<br>
* Jedi Luke (Destiny 6 Jedi, at least holds 4th Marker in EBO, works great in every other deck - DUH)<br>
* The Bith Shuffle &amp; Desparate Reach (Screws up tracking, cancels Barrier, Used 5)<br>
* The Signal (Used 5, take low-destiny Effects out if nothing else)<br>
* Throw Me Another Charge (Cancels Trooper Assault and Dark Jedi Presence, easily circulated 6)<br>
* Out Of Commission (Used 5, put Vader away for good)<br>
* Any destiny adders (draw your destiny one at a time, check to see if you like them or not, and track them through your deck. More destinies = more tracking opportunities)<br>
<br>
LIGHT TECH CARDS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS:<br>
These don&#146;t work in every Light deck, but they have their uses and can be very valuable tracking tools if used under the correct situations<br>
<br>
* Weapon Lev (Used 4, steal the Vader&#146;s Saber or Snoova&#146;s Ax)<br>
* Wind Chimes (even with few non-uniques, retrieval is retrieval and it&#146;s a Used 5)<br>
* Slight Weapons Malfunction (nice with permanent guns / axes, great combo with Aim High, Used 4)<br>
* Any Admiral&#146;s Orders (give your space that little extra edge, get an extra drain at docking bays, make his TIEs power 0, it&#146;s a 6 that only goes to the Used Pile)<br>
* Mirax (she is to LS what Janus is to DS - a tracking god[dess])<br>
* Reflection (just lose that high destiny card? get it back and track it, especially useful late game. Retrieval is retrieval)<br>
<br>
CARDS YOU NEED IN EVERY DARK DECK:<br>
This isn&#146;t easy, as Dark decks can be so versatile that virtually no cards fit in this category. Let me try anyway:<br>
<br>
* Ommni Box (Used 5 to screw up opponent&#146;s tracking, the It&#146;s Worse combo is nice)<br>
* Any destiny adders (draw your destiny one at a time, check to see if you like them or not, and track them through your deck. More destinies = more tracking opportunities)<br>
* Masterful Move (Used 6, search for the destiny 1 Ghhhk, cancel the annoying Savrip)<br>
<br>
DARK TECH CARDS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS:<br>
Again, these are hard to come by, and the Dark Side seems to work in combos, so your play style might be a little different<br>
<br>
* Weapon Lev (Used 4, steal the Luke&#146;s Saber or Vader&#146;s Saber back)<br>
* Janus (Tracking For Dummies all wrapped up in a single card)<br>
* Any Admiral&#146;s Orders (give your space that little extra edge, take away his X-Wings bite a little, it&#146;s a 6 that only goes to the Used Pile)<br>
* Emperor Palpatine (Destiny 6 Jedi, S/A done RIGHT aka It Works, pulls Force Lightning)<br>
* Force Lightning (Used 5, zap your own characters, Janus it back down and pull it again to check your deck, easy tracking)<br>
<br>
As you might have noticed, I didn&#146;t list Traffic Control or Reactor Terminal in here. If you&#146;ve built a solid deck, you won&#146;t need them. Janus and Mirax are much more efficient ways of getting the job done, and your deck should already have enough Used Interrupts to keep the hand size low and the high destinies flowing. The point is, there are other ways of getting cards back into your deck. Eve I use them every once in awhile (mains without many Used Ints, Dominations / Atrocities, etc), although I&#146;ll bet you won&#146;t see them in Hunter&#146;s deck. ;-) If you like them, use them. If you hate them, don&#146;t use them. It&#146;s up to you, as always. But think out of the box now.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am writing this article for 2 main reasons: Tatooine seems to be putting the hurt on tracking skills (I&#146;ve already dubbed it &quot;Tatoo-AntiViper-ine&quot;), and I don&#146;t care. I&#146;ll track anyways. Also, at the Vegas DPC, I put a lot of hate in against my 7th game opponent, but the worst was the Set For Stun on Ben. The rest of the story - that 7 would have stayed on the top of the deck the rest of the game had it continued... I guaruntee it.<br>
<br>
So what&#146;s so advanced? What can you still do that you haven&#146;t posted yet? Well, let me tell you. I&#146;m assuming you can track your reserve deck from the top, and you can track it from the bottom. This article will offer simple solutions to tracking through your Force / Used piles and also through your opponent&#146;s deck, unless your opponent is Matt Berta in which case this one won&#146;t work. Sorry. ;-) I&#146;ll be using most of the cards mentioned above to describe these techniques to you, so keep them in mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, tracking through your other piles. We&#146;ll start with destiny draws. This one&#146;s easy, and it has the potential to bring your tracking skills to the table turn 1. KNOW YOUR DESTINIES! You draw them one at a time, so if you get multiple, you draw one, register the number, put it in the used pile, and draw the next one. This is of ABSOLUTE IMPORTANCE - In the rare case that I actually miscount my cards, this is the only reason it happens. First, it helps to use LOTS of weapons, pack used interrupts that require destiny draws, and also to use Destiny adders. This will force many cards off the top of your deck so you will know what and where they are. Keep track of your high destinies and use the bottom-up technique to bring them to the top of your deck. If you activate and use a lot of Force, then initiate a battle, your deck will probably be so low that you can activate to your tracked destinies next turn.<br>
<br>
Also, instead of counting your deck after a good draw (thus giving away the fact that you&#146;re tracking), memorize the number of cards left in your Life Force, then count as you activate and use Force, and place your tracked card between the numbers. Now, instead of counting your cards, you just activate whatever was left on top of the destiny and draw the card. They usually won&#146;t see it coming if you use this strategy instead of counting decks every turn. If you play smooth like this (it helps to be REALLY good at math), it makes the tracking that much cooler when it happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
Count your opponent&#146;s destinies, too! It&#146;s much easier if he&#146;s low on Force, and I suggest only trying it if he actually is low while you&#146;re learning. If he draws the destiny 6 card, ask him how many cards are left in his deck. If you know that he&#146;s tracking it (you&#146;ll know because he&#146;ll activate the same number he told you a moment ago), throw an Ommni Box at him.* Masterful Move is another beating - if your opponent uses it at all, make sure you throw a Bith Shuffle down as soon as he recirculates. Keep this in mind - in order to use the card, he MUST have at least 1 card in his deck, and he MUST use a Force to search, so his deck will have AT LEAST 3 cards. You WILL be able to randomize his deck every time, even if he gets the first action of the next turn. Let him know you want an action after he activates a Force. This also holds true with circulating 5s, although I don&#146;t worry about my opponent&#146;s tracking if it&#146;s less than a destiny 5. If he&#146;s tracking the high destiny and is finally going to break a key character&#146;s immunity, move the character away. Knowing the destinies coming at you will win you games.<br>
<br>
* Don&#146;t actually throw cards or boxes at your opponent.<br>
<br>
<br>
To track your cards through your Force pile is the ultimate protection of tracked destinies and will prove to be the reason Tatoo-AntiViper-ive won&#146;t hurt you. So you&#146;ve tracked your destinies, and you&#146;ve got a nice destiny on the top of your deck. Your opponent knows it, and doesn&#146;t battle you. So now, you&#146;ve still got that nice destiny sitting on top of your deck and it&#146;s your activate phase. This, my friends, is TECH.<br>
<br>
I&#146;m going to reveal my secret to all good tracking, and I wasn&#146;t planning on doing it in this article at all, so prepare to be amazed:<br>
<br>
TRACK IN PAIRS.<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s why. You will need to have a tracked pair farther down in your deck - tracking 2 sets isn&#146;t that hard. Getting a pair together isn&#146;t that hard, either. Signal for something and use the Bith Shuffle to stack a pair of 5s, use 2 Ommni Boxes together, use a high destiny before anything else gets in your Used pile and then use Mirax / Janus to stack another high destiny under it, and the list goes on and on. There are easy ways to stack pairs together. Know where the pairs are, and don&#146;t activate one without activating the other. You NEED to keep the pair together. Hidden Base really hurts this endeavor, so use your pair instead of using one to draw the other OR use one to draw the other, let&#146;s say it&#146;s an Out Of Commission. Use it, and they&#146;re stacked together again. Pairs are your friend.<br>
<br>
Search through your hand and find EXACTLY how much Force you will need to use this turn. Activate EXACTLY that amount. Use your Force to your other tracked pair. As soon as you activate 1, your tracked single will be on the bottom of your Force pile. Keep activating to the tracked pair still in your deck, and your other high destiny will STILL be on the bottom of your Force pile. Use all the Force you activated (because you activated wisely, right?)and battle, and now your tracked single is on the top of your Used Pile. Draw your destiny - oh look, it&#146;s high! What a coincidence. And now the top 2 cards of your Used pile are both high. Recirculate, and you&#146;ve still got a high destiny on top of your deck to draw. Next turn, repeat everything all over again - activate to the pair, use all your Force, battle, and your top 2 cards of your Used will be high again. It&#146;s a machine. This is easier if you track more cards, say 3, 4, or 5, but it can be done with a single card and the pair.<br>
<br>
As for Tatooine - you NEED to activate MUCH MORE than the Force you&#146;ll actually need in order to make it work right, but when you get your activation engine running, it will work. Just make sure you save 1 Force at the end of each turn, 4 if your opponent has the queen (or the opportunity to do so). If The Trace Was Correct lets your opponent shuffle your deck, but he can&#146;t touch your Force Pile. You NEED to have the bottom card of your Force pile tracked - know what the thing is. Bring the beat squad to destroy Maul into a million billion pieces (use Jedi, weapons, Blaster Proficiency, etc), and suddenly you&#146;ve instantly started tracking again with that Force Pile card. You don&#146;t need to hope for a high destiny interrupt or effect with this technique, Trace can&#146;t touch your Force Pile, and the popular Ommni Box combo doesn&#146;t shuffle your Force Pile. If he has your queen, he can use 3 of your Force Beggar-style, so make sure you save 4 instead of 1 in this case. He probably won&#146;t have the opportunity to do so until mid to late game, and you should have enough activation at that point to save enough to track. You also need to constantly know what the top card of your deck is, since you&#146;ll need to activate it (making it the bottom card of your Force Pile) in order for this to work.<br>
<br>
This is also how I Set For Stunned Ben Kenobi and would have kept the destiny 7 on the top of the deck the rest of the game. I had 19 Force left, and I was activating 21 a turn. So I have the ability to activate my entire deck whenever I want. I used Janus to put the 7 on the bottom of the Used Pile on his turn, making it the bottom card of my deck after we recirculated. I activated all but 2 and used Janus to take the top card off of my deck and put a card from my hand back. I used Set For Stun and drew the 7, making it the top card of my Used Pile and my Reserve Deck empty. I recirculate with cards in my Force Pile, and the 7 is on top of my deck. If he battles me, I draw the 7. If not, I have 2 options:<br>
<br>
1) activate all except 1, Janus the 7 down and pick up my last card, then lose the top card of my deck to his drain, leaving the 7 on top.<br>
<br>
2) activate everything and find a way to use all the Force I just activated. If I&#146;ve got 10 cards left, the 7 will be on top. I activate the 7, leaving 9 cards left. I activate the other 9 and find a way to use all 10 Force, and recirculate, leaving the 7 on top again. You can leave a single Force left in the deck and use Twi&#146;lek to burn 3 Force; use Janus to burn a Force, pick it up, and drop a hand card to the bottom of the Used Pile; Masterful Move to search the deck; or whatever. Make sure it&#146;s not an interrupt, because the Tatoo-AntiViper-ive card &quot;Changing The Odds&quot; will cause it to be lost.<br>
<br>
I would have chosen option 2, because I don&#146;t have to lose cards in order to make it work. Turns out after I SFS Ben, I drained over him and won the game instead.<br>
<br>
TECH COMBOS:<br>
Most of the cards listed above should be put in your decks anyway, and you can find them using either of the previous tracking articles, so I won&#146;t go into depth about how to use them. The idea was to point them out and give ideas of how to do it effectively and efficiently. Here are some advanced combos to think about and expand upon:<br>
<br>
* Track a card to the top of your deck. If you don&#146;t draw it for destiny on your opponent&#146;s batle phase, activate 3 (the first being tracked), use The Signal (or Twi&#146;lek), and get an effect. Now your used pile, from the bottom to the top, is: don&#146;t care, don&#146;t care, tracked, 5. And with that, you&#146;ve got another pair waiting to go. Pairs are your friend.<br>
<br>
* Using Mirax and tracked destinies to draw effects and Jedi Lukes exclusively will be KEY against the new Tatoo-AntiViper-ine character that can force your Interrupt destinies to be lost. Begger also helps since he has to use 2 Force, but do what you want to.<br>
<br>
* Use Force Lightning to zap Janus, then use Janus to stack another high destiny under it, keeping your pair intact, and drawing a destiny off the top of your deck. This also works wonders if you suddenly realize you&#146;ve miscounted, and your tracked card is 2nd from the top instead of on the top - it burns the top card of your deck.<br>
<br>
* Burning cards off the top of your deck, as listed above, is TECH. You can lose cards off the top to drains or direct damage to dig to your tracked card, use Janus to burn a card, etc. If you know your top card is a low destiny, search for something. Anything. Look for a Force Lightning, Evader, hologram, effect, or whatever. If you can&#146;t track high destinies for whatever reason, tracking your low destinies for this exact situation can help you, too. It doesn&#146;t guaruntee a high destiny, but shuffling and drawing blind is better than drawing a 1 for battle destiny.<br>
<br>
* Search for cards! Use cards in your deck that let you pull something else every turn. I like Crush The Rebellion simply because it lets me shuffle my Reserve Deck at will. This can be just as important as shuffling your opponent&#146;s deck.<br>
<br>
As a final note, I want to thank everyone who talked to me about these articles, whether in person, email, dmail, or whatever. I really appreciate knowing that these articles actually helped you guys, and even the ones who already knew what&#146;s up read them for interest if nothing else. I&#146;m sorry this one isn&#146;t as long or as detailed as the others, but that seems to be what was wanted. I wanted to give strategies without annoying, long examples. I&#146;m 1750 headed towards 1920, and I have the bad feeling I&#146;ve just made the road ahead a lot harder. ;-)<br>
<br>
* Climax_Giver rated 3 stars and said that &quot;It all depends on if you know it or not already.&quot; You know I don&#146;t take low ratings badly - it&#146;s part of the game, and he&#146;s right. I just want to make sure more people know it now.<br>
* Thanks to Brian Hunter for the inspiration to write this last installment, and also for the Throw Me Another Charge tech. Used 6s are our friend.<br>
* Around 100 people have told me in one form or another that these articles have greatly improved their game. You guys are the reason I keep writing, and I thank you for your support and ideas.<br>
* IG-99 tried to use my tracking articles against me in a game, but he found out just how much of a pain The Bith Shuffle can be in the hands of a player who can track it back to his hand. PACK ANTI-TRACKING along with your deck, and catch it if you ever see it played against you consistantly. And remember that the Falcon doesn&#146;t have a hyperspeed of 12. (inside joke)<br>
* Many higher ranked players I&#146;ve talked to about the subject think I&#146;m insane for tracking so many cards through my deck. You can play effectively and win by tracking a single card for just a turn or 2; don&#146;t let this overwhelm you. Track more if you want, but it&#146;s not the only way to play.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading! As always, if you want to discuss anything in greater detail, please dmail me (BlackViper) and I&#146;ll get back to you ASAP. I may write all these in-depth articles; I may seem like I&#146;m far away over the net, and I may be on the SW:CCG rise in a huge way, but I&#146;m just one guy. I&#146;m no better than the 1100 player, and I&#146;m no worse than the average 2300 player. We are simply people, so NEVER feel intimidated to talk to me (or anyone else). I&#146;m easily approachable and willing to chat about tech or whatever. I say this because this shy kid came up to me during the Vegas DPC and was all afraid to talk to me about tracking because I was this god or something - I&#146;m not, and I don&#146;t to come across like that. I sincerely hope this helps your game.<br>
<br>
Until our next game;<br>
