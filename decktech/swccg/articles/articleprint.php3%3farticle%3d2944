For those that don't know me I am the founder of decktech.net, this web site. I want to take a few minutes to share a few thoughts about the future of DeckTech and Star Wars CCG. <br>
<br>
The future of SW:CCG as we all know it is not looking to bright and though I truly wish this was not so, no amount of wishing or petitioning can alter this reality. When you have been doing this as long as I have you get use to the regular pronouncement of the games imminent demise by the occasionally dissatisfied customer.  I am not one of those people. <br>
<br>
It is my business to monitor the undercurrents of our game, the behind the scenes news the things most people do not have access to. Because of this I often times have information that I cannot share publicly but that guides my planning and decision making process. <br>
<br>
As many of you know our SW:CCG members are the life's blood of this web site. Without each of you this site would be a cyber-ghost town. So in a very real way the success and future of DeckTech is tied to the future of the game. <br>
<br>
In the next few months we will be seeing some drastic changes to what we have come to know and love about our game. For many it will mean a death of sorts, to others a fresh beginning. Our only hope is that in this process of change, we not loose those elements that are most important, the spirit of the game, the elegance of game play, the epic nature of the Star Wars saga and the community we have taken so long to build. <br>
<br>
We will remain committed to the players and will do our part to insure our voices are heard by those that will listen. <br>
<br>
We have learned quite a bit over the years. Our goal now is to take what we have learned and use it to benefit other gaming communities. Currently we are working on a DeckTech for Raw Deal. We also have plans for other card games and are always open to suggestions from our members on other games they enjoy. <br>
<br>
But our first priority is always Star Wars. So once all the information becomes public and the debris and dust settles, we will construct a new home for the avid Star Wars gamer. It will be a place for a new beginning for those that wish to continue on in this game. <br>
<br>
If there is one thing you can be sure of in life it is change. Everything changes. We are no exception. DeckTech will not disappear; we will change. <br>
<br>
And we will hope for the best.<br>
