You just bought 3 Vaders, 3 Bens etc. and you all set to play SWCCG.  There is just one small problem.  Oh yeah.  I need a deck.  No big deal I will just take the number one deck of Decktech for dark and light and I will be all set!	So you build them, go to your tournament and finish 1-5 with your one win coming from a first round bye.  What went wrong?<br>
<br>
The deck building of SWCCG is basically broken up into five main parts:<br>
1.	Acquiring Cards<br>
2.	Building Decks<br>
3.	Playing Decks<br>
4.	Changing Decks to make them play better<br>
5.	Analyzing other decks you will play and either<br>
a) adapting your deck to be able to deal with these strategies<br>
b) or scrapping the deck all together and trying something else<br>
<br>
So that is it in a nutshell.  I am pretty sure you all know how to acquire cards.  After you have these cards YOU need to build decks, not your friend for you, YOU need to build them yourself.  The only way you find out what kind of player you are is by using decks of your own cards, you learn what strategies you like and dislike.  Eventually after doing this you can go look at another popular deck that someone is using and then quickly adapt it to fit your playing style.  There are some key points to follow when building a deck which is pretty much universal with every deck you build:<br>
<br>
1.	Does my deck have a way to deal with force drains.  If not, do something.  If nothing else is guaranteed in the game, you WILL at sometime play a deck which sets up heavy force drains against you, and if you can&#8217;t lessen or stop the drains you will lose 99% of the time.  There are a few ways to deal with force drains some are as follows:<br>
a)	Undercover spies<br>
b)	Controls<br>
c)	It Could Be Worse<br>
d)	Imperial Decree and Menace Fades<br>
e)	Jedi Test 1<br>
f)	Projection Of A Skywalker<br>
g)	Objectives That Lessen Drains<br>
My personal favorites are Imperial Decree and Menace Fades because while in the process of setting these two up to cancel their drain bonuses you are also in the process of controlling two locations which you yourself can drain at!  Be careful of some of these though because some decks cause their drains to get the ability drains cannot be modified or canceled so in these cases your only way of stopping these drains is by having an undercover spy or stopping their drain bonuses.<br>
<br>
2) Your deck needs to have a way it can win if it cannot battle your opponent.	Even if you have a battling deck you need to have a strategy to be able to fall back on if they are using a non-combative deck strategy.   This gives your deck versatility and strength.  The easiest way to make a combative deck win games even if it cannot battle is adding a few solid drain locations in and also adding direct damage cards.  Examples of good drain locations are:<br>
a)	tatooine: cantina (both sides)<br>
b)	endor: back door (both sides)<br>
c)	kiffex (both sides)<br>
d)	cloud city: lower corridor (light side)<br>
e)	cloud city: carbonite chamber (light side)<br>
f)	kessel (light side)<br>
g)	kashyyk (dark side)<br>
h)	tatooine: lars moisture farm (dark side)<br>
examples of good direct damage cards are:<br>
a)	ability, ability, ability<br>
b)	civil disorder<br>
c)	the shaft (much anger in him and responsibility of command combo)<br>
d)	uncontrollable fury<br>
e)	order to engage<br>
f)	the bhbm and profit objectives<br>
<br>
3) Your deck needs to be able to defend itself and make it not susceptible to beatdown as well.  This can pretty much only be accomplished by intelligent playing.  Here are a few strategies that can help you with this.<br>
a)	if you get beat for a lot of force in battles, play houjix and ghhhk<br>
b)	do not leave people alone at sites<br>
c)	play mantellian savrip to lessen force loss and keep characters alive<br>
d)	use bacta tank to keep your key characters alive<br>
e)	use imperial or rebel barrier to allow them less characters to beat you down with.<br>
f)	Have a method of force retrieval to get it all back<br>
<br>
4) You need sense alter protection of some sort.  If you do not you will be in trouble and sense alter will walk all over you.	Here are a few ways to deal with it:<br>
a)	play all cards immune to sense and alter<br>
b)	play controls<br>
c)	play sense alter yourself<br>
d)	use do or do not or there is no try to make their sense alter lost<br>
e)	use wise advice or oppressive enforcement and grabbers<br>
<br>
So the next thing you should do is begin to play this newly constructed deck you have.	Play it against as many decks as possible and make notes of strengths/weaknesses of your deck.	This will help you later in the revision process of your deck.	Another good thing to do at this time is to talk to veteran players who might use a similar deck, they can provide good insight for you to follow, but remember their word is not law and they will surely have a different playing style than you so listen to their advice, but do not try to become them by making your deck exactly like theres because it takes away from YOUR deck and you will do much better with YOUR deck than with someone elses.<br>
<br>
Now what you must do is have your deck go through some changes.  You think of all of the previous games you have played with it and think about its weaknesses and strengths.  Keep the strengths in the deck, and also look for ways to strengthen them further.  Next, look for weaknesses or holes in your deck and try to find ways to fill them to give your deck a better chance.  When you are done with this try to compare your deck to the current popular decks, make sure it can deal with them.  For example the decks I see as powerful after JPOTSD are:<br>
1)	BHBM<br>
2)	Hunt Down<br>
3)	Profit<br>
4)	Throne Room Mains<br>
5)	Jedi Training<br>
6)	The New Light Objective Using Speeders Or Eloms<br>
7)	Sienar Fleet Systems Ties<br>
If you can make your deck able to beat these you will probably do just fine with it at a tournament.  REMEMBER YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR DECK ABLE TO HAVE COUNTERS TO EVERYTHING OR IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WIN FOR ITSELF.	Face it there are decks that have better match ups against other decks, that is a simple fact.	If you make a deck there are always going to be things in your way, you cannot deal with them all but you can make your deck as good as it can be.  Do not over prepare your deck.<br>
<br>
Finally, if after your revision stage you find your deck has too many holes or still always constantly loses to the most popular style of deck, you may want to consider a change in deck strategy, then you get to repeat it all over again!<br>
