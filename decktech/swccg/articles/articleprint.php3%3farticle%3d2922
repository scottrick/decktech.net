Golf season is over now here at Normal Community High School, and I don&#146;t know what to do with myself.  I figured I&#146;d start writing a weekly article series about my life and the happenings of that week.  Kind of like &quot;archiving my life&quot; so that when I&#146;m senile and 70 years old, I can go to decktech from the laptop in my Nursing home room and remember what my life was like as a teenager.  I urge you not to even read on if you don&#146;t enjoy reading off-topic articles, or you just want to rate it badly because it&#146;s not about SWCCG.  I know for all of those people, this will be a waste of time that doesn&amp;#8217;t help you play better SWCCG, so you might as well just stop reading now.  I&amp;#8217;m trying to decide on a good format for the series, how to organize it and such, and haven&amp;#8217;t come up with something that is concrete yet.  So bare with me while I try new things in the articles to come, because they might change a bit.  I am planning on dividing everything into sections so if you choose to read about one aspect of my life, and not another, it will be much easier for you.  I may have some vulgur and funny sh/it in here.  If you don&amp;#8217;t want that, just to go to www.dictionary.com, translate it into spanish, and then read it then.  You prolly won&amp;#8217;t be too offended at that, will ya?  On to the dirt!<br>

-School<br>
Well, things haven&amp;#8217;t been going to good as far as academics are concerned.  I have a C in Math (advanced topics in analytic (sp?) algebra,) as well as a C in American Lit. and Comp.  Damn Huckleberry Finn. However, as far as social life at school is concerned, things are going better than ever.  There are these 3 chicks who (as far as I know) want to get into my pants.  That is normally a good thing, accept that when the freeking chance finally comes for me too get some booty during the school year, I have to have a girlfriend.  Blah.  Ah well, I&amp;#8217;d rather have Paige then being with random Freshman girls from my school.  (well, maybe)  This funny thing happened on Thursday.  I was playing Mini-golf at www.candystand.com on one of the school computers, and the librarian comes over.  This lady is like a freekin nun up in here.  She tells me to log off the computer, then she gets back on and checks my history to make sure that I didn&amp;#8217;t look at anything innapropriate.  (like I would) Following, was a lecture on how school computers are only to be used for schoolwork.  So she writes my name down, and I think if I get caught doing non-school things there again, there will be hell to pay.  Ah well. <br>
-Social Life<br>
	SUCKS.  All I do all day is sit at home, or go to Paige&amp;#8217;s house.  Every once in a blue moon, I go down to Cyberia: The Gamers Haven, or I go to the mall with my bud Mike Kitchell and we play Dance Dance Revolution.  Although that my socal life outside of school sucks, the one inside school is pretty damn good.  Paige and I went to my Homecoming, and her Homecoming this year.  Both were pretty average, nothing really funny or unforgetable happened.  We ate, we danced, we left.  We did, however, get a limo for the Normal West Homecoming, which was awesome.  I broke 4 plasic cups and threw them out the window, and I kept calling the driver on the little phone.  We shared the limo with 6 other people: Jaime, Dean, Crystal, Mike, Dan, and &amp;#8220;some other chick&amp;#8221; who&amp;#8217;s name I don&amp;#8217;t remember.  <br>
<br>
-Paige<br>
	Paige and I are getting along better than ever.  The 15th was 3 months for us.  Whoa!  Three months&amp;#8230;that&amp;#8217;s like, forever.  Paiges parents dated for 2 ½ months, and then they got married.  And they&amp;#8217;ve been together for 16 years!  Not a lot of head going on here, although I have had a lot of action, just not oral sex.  Nothing new here.<br>
<br>
-Random Jank<br>
	My fingers are starting to hurt, so I think I&amp;#8217;ll wrap it up here for the week.  Feel free to send me your questions, comments, complaints, etc&amp;#8230; maybe you&amp;#8217;ll make the next edition of &amp;#8220;Brad in Normal&amp;#8221;  Until next time.<br>
