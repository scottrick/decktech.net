<br>
     This article concerns an underestimated strategy, reacting. I'll try to convince you of the power of reacting, maybe convince you to use it in a deck. Actually, you might already use it, with AT-STs, speeder bikes, etc. But if you do use it, I'm at least gonna try to explain to you just how powerful reacting is. The appeal of reacting is being able to spread out more, and if the opponent battles, you can guarantee winning the battle, possibly for major damage, and the opponent probably won't battle you for remainder of game. First, here's something you need to know to fully understand the power of reacting.<br>
<br>
     When considering whether to battle the opponent, you should take a couple of things into that consideration. One thing is their power + forfeit. The idea is that your power + attrition has to be more than their power + forfeit + attrition in order for them to lose any Life Force. Your power may be triple theirs, but if they have really high forfeit it won't matter. What does this have to do with reacting? Well, let's say when the opponent battles, you move a Patrol Craft with Lt. Pol Treidum as a react. It may not sound like much; you only added 3 to your power. However, you added 8 (10 if IAO is out) to your forfeit. Your power + forfeit for this react is 11 (13 if IAO is out). What this means is that the opponent's power + attrition has to be at least 11 more for you to lose any Life Force. They'd have to deploy Obi-Wan, Luke, and a scrub to make up for it! You may not fully grasp this concept, but it basically means that even small reacts can make big differences in battles.<br>
<br>
     There are 3 types of reacting: moving to a battle as a react, moving away from a battle as a react, and deploying as a react. They all can be powerful, but they're very different.<br>
<br>
     First, moving to a battle as a react. Cards that do (or let you do) this include:<br>
Zuckuss<br>
Tempest Scout<br>
Speeder Bike<br>
Tempest Scout 1<br>
Tempest Scout 2<br>
Tempest Scout 3<br>
Tempest Scout 5<br>
Tempest Scout 6<br>
Patrol Craft<br>
Mobquet A-1 Deluxe Floater<br>
Luke's X-34 Landspeeder<br>
Sorosuub V-35 Landspeeder<br>
Shistavanen Wolfman<br>
Rebel Scout<br>
Sandspeeder<br>
Snowspeeder<br>
Blizzard Scout 1<br>
Dash<br>
Skiff<br>
Colonel Dyer<br>
Lift Tube<br>
Homing Beacon<br>
Solomahal<br>
Jet Pack<br>
Ubrikkian 9000 Z001<br>
Officer Exax<br>
Dantooine (DS)<br>
Bespin Motors Void Spider THX 1138<br>
Informant<br>
Rogue 1<br>
Rogue 2<br>
Rogue 3<br>
Rogue 4<br>
Snowtrooper Officer<br>
Kuat<br>
Ewok Sentry<br>
and probably some others I missed. Being able to move as a react lets you spread out more, because you don't need to have a high power at each location. Instead, you can thin out more, but if the opponent battles, you can react with everything you have, greatly increasing your power. That's the basic idea. Now most of the time to react you have to save Force. I've never liked saving Force. For one thing, the opponent can always look at your saved Force, and possibly figure out what you want to do. I realize some of the more powerful moving reacts require saved Force, but I prefer moving as a react for free. True, for 1 measly Force you can move 8 characters, possibly dozens of power, as a react with the Skiff. I also realize that a group of biker scouts on bikes can control a whole planet, but this requires some Force. Another reason I don't like it is that you don't know what that saved Force is. What if that saved Force in your Force Pile is the key card for your deck? Well, now you can't draw it; you need it in your Force Pile to react. Also, moving as a react for free is more surprising; it has more shock value. So, I'm only going to cover the cards that do this for free.<br>
<br>
     Cards that can move (or let you move) as a react for free include<br>
Tempest Scout 1<br>
Tempest Scout 6<br>
Zuckuss<br>
Luke's X-34 Landspeeder<br>
Sorosuub V-35 Landspeeder<br>
Mobquet A-1 Deluxe Floater<br>
Homing Beacon<br>
Informant<br>
Dash<br>
Kuat<br>
Ewok Sentry<br>
and maybe some I missed. For the DS, take Tempest Scout 1 (preferably with Arnet piloting), Tempest Scout 6, and Zuckuss. With one of these at each of 3 different sites, you have some drain potential. And if opponent battles at one of those sites, just move the other cards as a react to that battle. Assuming Arnet is piloting TS1, opponent's power + attrition has to be at least 28 (I think) for you to lose any Life Force if these cards are at the some site. Not bad. This total can easily be higher with other characters. Also, with only 2 other characters, any characters, at 2 other sites, you can control 5 sites without too much fear of getting battled. With the power of moving as a react for free, you can spread out a lot more, considering you don't have to have a lot of power at each site, considering you can just move as a react for free. Next up is the Mobquet A-1 Deluxe Floater. This one, for those of you who don't know, is deploy 2, forfeit 5, power 2, maneuver 5, landspeed 3, destiny 4, and can add 2 passengers. It can move as a react, for free is a bounty hunter or Jabba aboard or if there's a bounty hunter in the battle you're reacting to. I think the best deck to use this in would be COTVG. With your bounty hunters and Mobquets, you can spread out and drain more, with less fear of being battled. Zuckuss would also be good in a COTVG deck. Onto the LS. You have Sorosuub V-35 Landspeeder, and Luke's X-34 Landspeeder. The Sorosuub V-35 Landspeeder, for those of you who don't know, is deploy 2, forfeit 3, power 0, maneuver 4, landspeed 3, destiny 4. Luke's Landspeeder is deploy 2, forfeit 4, power 1, maneuver 5, landspeed 4, destiny 3. The Sorosuub moves as a react for free when Owen, Beru, or Luke is aboard. Luke's Landspeeder moves as a react for free when Luke is aboard. The Sorosuub can add 4 passengers, Luke's Landspeeder can add 3. Wow. Just imagine, with the Sorosuub, moving EPP Luke, EPP Han, EPP Leia, and EPP Obi-Wan as a react for free. Not only will your opponent be shocked already, but imagine the shock when you use Gift Of The Mentor, I Know, and Don't Get Cocky. Well now you get somewhere around 9 battle destinies. And it's all due to the power of reacting.<br>
<br>
     Now onto moving away from a battle as a react. Cards that can do this include<br>
Dodge<br>
Arcona<br>
Life Tube Escape<br>
and, ummm... is that it? Well, we'll just have to work with what we have. This type of reacting can easily be considered the least popular. Anyway, Arconas can be powerful. Leaving one alone isn't a problem considering that for 1 Force you can cancel the battle by moving away as a react. This lets you drain without fear. Dodge lets any character move away from a battle as a react. You can really spread out now. Imagine controlling 10 sites with 10 scrubs. Lots of drain potential. And if the opponent battles, just use Dodge. Or Arconas text if he's the one alone. Lift Tube Escape works with Lift Tubes. This can be very annoying to the opponent if you just keep reacting away. And it's all possible thanks to the power of reacting.<br>
<br>
     Now we're at deploying as a react. Cards that let you do this include:<br>
Comlink<br>
CZ-3<br>
CZ-4<br>
Cloud Car<br>
Combat Cloud Car<br>
Patrol Craft<br>
Black 4<br>
Accuser (D*II)<br>
TIE Defender Mark 1<br>
Snivvian<br>
Tempest Scout 6<br>
TIE Vanguard<br>
Spiral<br>
Cloud City: Dining Room<br>
IM4-099<br>
Dr. Evazan's Sawed Off Blaster<br>
Ponda Baba's Hold-Out Blaster<br>
Major Hewex<br>
Scout Blaster<br>
Rescue In The Clouds<br>
Rectenna<br>
Anoat<br>
Florn Lamproid<br>
Laudica<br>
Ewok Sentry<br>
Hermi Odle<br>
I Have A Very Bad Feeling About This<br>
Go For Help!<br>
and I know there's others, I just can't think of them right now. Anyway, one thing about deploying as a react is it has the most shock value. After all, when you move as a react, you have to move a card that's already on table. But when you deploy as a react, it could be anything. However, most of the time you have to save up Force to deploy as a react. Black 4 can deploy with a pilot for free; it's one exception. Now, let's enter nighttime conditions into the equation. Keeping in mind that spies deploy for free under nighttime conditions (I can't stress that enough!) voila! With CZ-3 and Nightfall or Comlink and Sunsdown, you can deploy spies for free as a react! Very powerful. Even more powerful with ISB Ops, considering the vast amount of spies possible in that deck. For the LS you also have Snivvian. It may deploy as a react all by itself, and it's power +2 under nighttime conditions! It seems reacting and nighttime conditions were a match made in heaven. Snivvian can even do this for free with Tessek and Arleil Schous. CZ-4, when at a Jabba's Palace site can deploy one non-unique alien as a react from Reserve. This can be done for -1 Force with Chall Bekan, who just happens to be an ISB agent! Also can be done for -1 with Scum And Villainy and Jabba. To go even further; play ISB Ops, Sunsdown, and CZ-4. Now you can deploy an Outer Rim Scout (who just happens to be an ISB agent) for free as a react from Reserve. Or just use Comlink to deploy spies from hand as a react for free... not to mention the other cards in the list. Accuser, TIE Defender Mark 1, and Black 4 go well together, being able to turn the tide of any space battle. Same goes for TIE Vanguard. Cloud Car, Combat Cloud Car, and Patrol Craft go well together, all being able to control the Clouds with ease. Also with Rescue In The Clouds. The three weapons at the bottom of the list provide surprise for the opponent, possibly causing them to lose an extra character (or more if Dr. Evazan's Blaster). All this and more is possible with the power of reacting.<br>
<br>
     I'm not nearly done yet. I've talked about having to save up Force for reacts. Well, sometimes you don't have to even when it's not free. I'm talking about cards like<br>
Combat Readiness<br>
Careful Planning<br>
Imperial Supply<br>
Any Methods Necessary<br>
Blue Milk<br>
Beru Stew<br>
and maybe some others that let you activate Force at any time. With these cards, you can activate Force after the opponent has initiated battle, then use the Force to react! Always a nice surprise for your opponent. Any Methods Necessary even works well with COTVG and Mobquets. Combat Readiness and Careful Planning, in addition to having nice starting functions, also have very nice Used functions when used with reacting cards.<br>
<br>
     I've tried to make reacting sound as awesome as possible. The way I've described it, it almost seems unstoppable. As if every deck should use reacting cards. Well, that would be nice, but reacting isn't unstoppable. There are cards that cancel reacts, some of which are<br>
Silence Is Golden<br>
Lieutenant Arnet<br>
Lieutenant Nemet<br>
CZ-4<br>
A-wing (D*II)<br>
IM4-099<br>
Those Rebels Won't Escape Us<br>
Sense<br>
Klatooinian Revolutionary<br>
Pinned Down<br>
Corporal Beezer<br>
Full Scale Alert<br>
Ng'ok<br>
Romas &quot;Lock&quot; Navander<br>
and I know there's more. These are the reasons reacting isn't as possible as it could be. If these cards didn't exist, reacting would be too powerful. What's weird is that Lieutenant Arnet, IM4-099 and CZ-4 not only play roles in canceling reacts, but also help with reacting. Lieutenant Arnet does it by piloting Tempest Scout 1.<br>
<br>
    Last, but not least, are the cards that come close to being reacting cards. They don't let you technically &quot;react&quot;, but they do let you deploy cards to a battle or move away from a battle. These cards include:<br>
Hyper Escape<br>
Narrow Escape<br>
Hit And Run<br>
Krayt Dragon Bones<br>
Tauntaun Bones<br>
Panic<br>
Emergency Deployment<br>
Out Of Somewhere<br>
Surprise Counter Assault<br>
Counter Surprise Assault<br>
and I know there's more. The Bones cards let you deploy a character for free when opponent draws a three. A decent surprise for the opponent. Hyper Escape and Hit And Run let you move away from a battle, but not as a &quot;react&quot;. Counter Surprise Assault and Surprise Counter Assault let you deploy cards as a response to a Force drain. Sometimes there's very fine line sometimes between reacting and not reacting.<br>
<br>
     I have one last point to make. When the opponent battles, they usually expect to win. But with reacting, you can win the battle easily, unless they can cancel the react. Now, 2 of the coolest cards that go with reacting are You Overestimate Their Chances and You Underestimate Our Chances. These, if used correctly, can cause the opponent to lose an incredible amount of Force. 2 other cards that are must-haves with reacts are Houjix and Ghhhk. If they cancel your react, you're screwed. But not with these cards!<br>
<br>
     Well, you finally reached the end of the article, assuming you read it all. Thanks for reading. I hope I've at least made you think of reacting in a new way, maybe convinced you to use it in a deck. Never underestimate the power of reacting.<br>
