Hi, I am Chris Menzel (Darth Chrith) from Ralltir (Germany) and most of you will not know me. I am just an average player and try my best to keep the tourneys in the north of Germany (far from legendary Winfried Sommerfeld) running. What I do is advertising locally and in Scrye, sending huge e-mailings, printing T-shirts as prize support, and try to get new people in and get old ones back to the field. Admittedly, I probably became very active a bit to late but had some big tourneys before the fall of the big D. <br>
So, I finally something constructive to say. It is a long first article, but please bear with me and review gently.<br>
<br>
<br>
1)   The Problem<br>
<br>
Might be a local thing but I really have a problem getting people to come to the tourneys anymore. One reason here is, that the community is divided about the format in which to play.<br>
As great as scenario events and the like are, the restriction of cards often leads to an alienation between groups. We now have people only playing classic cards, complaining (perhaps rightfully) when they are utterly beaten by a Maul or the evil senate, whenever they play in an unlimited format. On the other hand you have E1 only players, that do not stand a chance against Zuckuss in his mighty ship and miss the start with 3 Effects. <br>
I often saw tourneys posted (some my own) that never came to pass, since there were not enough people for either event. The use or not use of Defensive Shields or Virtual Cards recently let me be witness to some heated debates on the net, putting a larger drift among players (if you have read it, you know what I mean).<br>
<br>
<br>
2 )  The Solution<br>
<br>
So, what is the unknown guy trying to get at here, you might ask. Let me try to get my point straight: I have seen enough events fail because motivated SW players could not come to an agreement about the format, that I suggest a solution for such cases. Many people would not even have a pure classic or pure E1 deck to maybe spontaneously take part in such an event.<br>
O. k., my suggestion is to regulate this problem with Starting Effects, much in the way that certain objectives (like Watch your Step, Senate, Theed Palace Objectives) regulate the use and restriction to certain cards. Let me give you an example:<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Classic Starting Effect Light Side (Virtual Game Text):<br>
<br>
Play on table before objectives are shown, as long as you have no cards with E1 icons in your deck (opponent may verify at the end of game). May place up to 5 Effects that are immune to Alter and deploy on table under this card. For remainder of game:<br>
Maul may only use a weapon once per turn. <br>
Alter may cancel Political Effects.<br>
Leia may be used instead of Amidala, when required by an opponent his card.<br>
The Signal may not be grabbed and you may use it (for 3 Force once per turn) to search your reserve deck or under this Starting Effect for any Effect and take into hand, OR to take  a battleground into hand from reserve deck. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a headache yet? This is just meant as an example. <br>
It is by no means all compassing or well phrased in game terms. It is just intended to bring my point across. <br>
The player, who for whatever reason puts the burden to himself to play only Classic cards, should be able to compete in an unlimited tourney without getting massacred. The above example would help to balance some things a bit, like having no Defensive Shield, Mindful of the Future, Amidala, new Alter or Anti-Maul cards. The Classic-only player could go to a classic tourney, or decide to compete in an unlimited environment at the expense of one card <br>
(the Starting Effect)!!! So, here is another example:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Episode 1 Starting Effect Light Side (Virtual Game Text):<br>
<br>
Play on table before objectives are shown, as long as you have only cards with E1 icons in your deck (opponent may verify at the end of game). This Effect may be played in addition to the Starting Effect Much Fear In Them. <br>
You may start the game with 3 Effects, that deploy on table, are always immune to Alter and deploy for free. <br>
For remainder of game:<br>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter may not use his game text. <br>
Qui-Gon may replace Luke, whenever required by an opponent his card.<br>
You may choose to count Republic characters as Rebels, when required by other cards.<br>
Once per turn may lose a card from hand to have opponent use 3 Force to initiate a Force Drain or use a Sabacc card for remainder of turn (unless they occupy a battleground system and a battleground) site.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, this would just be to balance some of the disadvantage an E1 only player would have in an unlimited environment. These Effects would not have to balance everything. There are not exactly the same assets available for the two sides (light and dark), too. Lateral damage as an example. But Zukuss would be broken against an E1 only player, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I feel, that these two Starting Effects, rephrased and play tested by the great minds of the Players Advocates (no irony, great job on the first cards and rules, people), would add tremendously to the community. Isn’t it better, instead of having 3 tourneys a month with 3-4 people, <br>
that cannot seem to agree on some format, to have one big tourney with 10 people in which every one can play. <br>
We have lost (and still are loosing) enough players as it is. This might help.<br>
<br>
May the Force be with you <br>
(and prevent me from an Attack of the Clowns)<br>
