I, for one, was excited to learn that I could re-enact my favorite scenes from A New Hope with ease. At least, that&amp;#8217;s what I thought. Blowing up Alderaan was damn hard, only a little better than @#$%ing damn hard when A New Hope (the set) was released. But Decipher listened (yeah, right!) to our problems and came up with a solution. With the addition of the new Tatooine helper effect, A Million Voices Crying Out, flipping Set Your Course For Alderaan became feasible. This new effect solved the problems of finding Commence Primary Ignition, the hardest part of blowing the planet up. It also gave you one more bonus for blowing up Alderaan, the ability to retrieve three force each time you deployed a Star Destroyer. Great, huh? On to the objective.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy Death Star and Alderaan systems and Docking Bay 327.] {For} remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth or a Subjugated planet. {While} this side is up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take on card with &quot;Death Star&quot; in title into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may not force drain at Alderaan system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled. {Flip} this card if Alderaan is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Well this is a pretty standard start, you get tons of force, Revolution is canceled, and you can grab everything you need to blow away Alderaan. Well, almost everything. As discussed before one of the major hindrances of this deck is the inability to grab CPI, therefore most people who wanted to FLIP this objective packed +5 copies of it. Flip the card.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 if [Victory] class) to Death Star system. Your Force Drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +2 (or +1 if [Victory] class). If Yavin 4 system is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponent&#146;s Yavin 4 site. {Place} out of play if Death Star is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Wow, once you do the hard part this side gives you many bonuses. Your Imperial Class Star Destroyers deploy -2 to the floating disco ball and your force drains are +2. This is great! Also, if you decide to continue on your rampage, your opponent loses +3 for every Yavin 4 site. This means even if your opponent isn&amp;#8217;t playing Yavin 4, the have to lose seven force. Seven force! But now came the clincher to play this objective. The new card.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Deploy on table. Twice per game may take Commence Primary Ignition into hand from Lost Pile or Reserve Deck. Reshuffle. If Alderaan &quot;blown away,&quot; retrieve 3 Force whenever you deploy a unique (*) Star Destroyer. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Now every card that you need can be pulled from your reserve deck. Let&amp;#8217;s start looking at the cards you need to start with. You start (obviously) with SYCFA, Death Star, Alderaan, and Death Star: Docking Bay 327. Now pull out Prepared Defenses from your common box and start with that as your Starting Interrupt. You&amp;#8217;ll also need AMVCO as one of your Starting Effects. Now you have a little bit of freedom with your other two. Mobilization Points is a good card because it gives you a boost in activation right off the start and you can grab the Granddaddy of them all, Executor. Something Special Planned for Them might be another choice because of the +2 move away from your SD&amp;#8217;s can really screw up a Hyper Escape. SSPFT also hinders some retrieval strategies such as a Harvest loop. You should also take a look at Oppressive Enforcement for SAC defense, destiny boost, and free grabbers.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	You&amp;#8217;ll obviously need some people to help you blow up the dissident rebels on Alderaan. I suggest playing with four Death Star Gunners, on the off chance that one gets activated or lost off the top. Some pilots for your Star Destroyers might be beneficial. Admiral Ozzel is a good choice because he deploys for free and your capitals deploy -1 to his system. Admiral Piett is another good pick because he is able to pull an Admiral&amp;#8217;s Order or a Commander, and the +3 to power can&amp;#8217;t hurt. Captain Godheart is a smart selection because of his ability to cancel landing claw. You&amp;#8217;ll probably want to pack a couple of Chiraneau&amp;#8217;s to add to your ever-increasing drain potential. Thrawn also adds a nice compliment to your gaggle of pilots. Now that you have a pretty strong space presence with characters, you&amp;#8217;ll want to take a look at your ground forces. I like to put in a trio of Vader and a Grand Moff Tarkin to control a site. My favorite Vader to use in this deck would be Vader with Dildo to slice your opponent into little pieces without needing to pull an extra card. ECC Iggy and EPP Bobby make good additions to your hit squad.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	To take full advantage of the game texts of SYCFA and AMVCO is to play Big Blue. You&amp;#8217;ll want the ability two permanent pilots. They are only a few. Avenger, Executor, Vengeance, and Chimera. Use these and about four more. I like to use Conquest, Tyrant, Thunderflare, and Visage. You&amp;#8217;ll also want to throw in a couple bounty hunter ships. Good ones to include are Bossk In Bus and Dengar In Punisher. You&amp;#8217;re using Iggy and Bob on the ground, and most people make sure they have the required 7 for Zuckuss. <br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Moving on to weapons you&amp;#8217;ll probably need the Superlaser to actually destroy any planets. That should be it here unless you wanted to throw in Mara, in that case you&amp;#8217;ll need her vibrator. Also, if you plan on using a different Vader, you&amp;#8217;ll need his dildo as well.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	You&amp;#8217;ll want to throw in CPI; however, you only need one copy because theoretically you could use it three times! Draw it in your opening hand, use it to blow, lose, AMVCO, use it to blow, lose, AMVCO, use it to blow, lose! Wow! (sarcasm) You&amp;#8217;ll also need an Admiral&amp;#8217;s Order. I like to use We&amp;#8217;re In Attack Position Now to work up some immunity.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Some useful effects are a couple Lateral Damages to take out the annoying Home One or Millennium Falcon, a grabber to take out those pain in the @$$ interrupts like Harvest. Come Here You Big Coward to prevent your opponent from playing cheese, and to stop you from getting smacked at your own Death Star locations. Secret Plans gives you even more retrieval protection. Crush the Rebellion helps you out from getting laid by EPP beatdown if you&amp;#8217;re playing against QMC. First Strike will give you even more retrieval as this deck can be very aggressive if need be. I&amp;#8217;ve Lost Artoo can be a very mean card if you want to smack on a little X-wing but your opponent has a Hyper Escape. <br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	You&amp;#8217;ll need many interrupts to help you on your quest to victory. Imperial Command is an excellent card to pack in threes to help you pull Piett and thus WIAPN and your other Admirals. Later on you can use it to add or prevent battle destinies. Ghhhk &amp; Those Rebels Won&amp;#8217;t Escape Us are good in case you get in a battle over your head or you&amp;#8217;re playing a &amp;#8220;Run Away!&amp;#8221; deck like EBO to cancel the all might Hyper Escape. Omni Box &amp; It&amp;#8217;s Worse is good to ruin your opponent&amp;#8217;s tracking and to mess with their It Could Be Worse found in many light decks. Control &amp; Set For Stun is another interrupt I pack two of. I use this for even more SAC defense, to cancel huge drains, and to hinder character based decks such as Profit and even worse MWYHL. Set For Stun really screws with MWYHL, which is normally an incredibly slow deck, this makes it even slower. Gravity Shadow is an excellent card if your opponent is trying to move away from you, play this card and sometimes win the game in Battle Damage. Put All Sections On Alert is a must with all the cards with Death Star in their title.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	Locations are a must in this deck. I usually use three more Death Star locations, so that if my opponent has no presence on the Death Star and I have all Death Star Gunners out, I need a 0 to blow Alderaan. Granted, of course, my opponent isn&amp;#8217;t playing EBO or Yavin 4 Mains. I use Conference Room, to do the Leader trick, Mil Corridor so I can move for free unrestricted around the big floating disco ball (thanks, Fred), and the War Room. Kashyyyk, Yavin 4, and Sullust usually find there way into all my DS decks. In this deck they can all be possible drain for six locations, except Yavin, which is five (+2 from objective, +2 from Chiraneau). <br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
	This concludes the flip part of this article. What follows are decktypes for pussies who don&amp;#8217;t like to flip. (j/k)<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Manipulator: This is a deck that denies your opponent force and using manipulating cards to twist your opponent around your finger. I am not real familiar with this tupe so I&amp;#8217;ll list some cards that are commonly found in manipulative decks. M&amp;#8217;iiyoom Onith- hide her away on the Death Star and guard her with Ephant Mon and start wiping away males. Monnok- sooo many peeps are playing doubles these days its not even funny. Ability x3- Great against mains decks once all of their mains are out. The reason to play manip. on this platform is the great force activation for you, and the not so great activation for him. You&amp;#8217;ll need all that force to pay for Monnok and Onith.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
SYCFA TIE- aka Monkey TIEs. Basically you use Mob. Points to grab Wakeelmui and to build huge activation. Signal for Seinar Fleet Systems, drop TIEs and retreive out the wazoo. This deck is aided by cards such as Dark Maneuvers, Tallon Roll, Short Range Fighters, All Power To Weapons, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, and so so many more. This type of deck has good power and the ability to drain for a lot. There are several vad things about this decktype. TIEs have no hyperspeed (at least the ones that you want to use) and have to rely on Star Destroyers and Dreadnaughts to ferry them around. However, all around this is a very strong decktype. (Personally, I like the the EOps TIES with ORumors and Perimeter Patrol and Ephant).<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Brangus- see Bastian &amp;#8216;Death Star&amp;#8217; Winklehaus<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Prodigy- a mix between Brangus and Court. See examples<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
Well, in conclusion SYCFA is one of the most powerful decks in the Dark Side Sucks Meta of today. Whether you choose to flip, or not to flip, to blow or have a continuous docking bay retreival loop, SYCFA will show up in many tournaments and on decktech. Here are some that are the best examples of each type of SYCFA:<br>
