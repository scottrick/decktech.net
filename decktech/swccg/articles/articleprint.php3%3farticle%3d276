I am doing the same for Enhanced Jabba's Palace.  These articles are written with newbies and intermediates in mind, but I believe that advanced players can always benefit from thorough analysis of new cards.  This first article was on the Dark Objective, aptly called 'Court of the Vile Gangster/ I Will Enjoy Watching You Die.'	This article is on the Light Side objective, 'You Will Either Profit By This/Or Be Destroyed.'  Unfortunately, this objective may be of lesser use than Quiet Mining Colony, the ECC objective.  Therefore, I don't expect high ratings for this article; I merely want people to see the possibilities and whether those possibilities can be competitive or not.  This is the exact game text as confirmed by Decipher.<br>
<br>
--You Can Either Profit By This--<br>
Deploy Tatooine: Jabba's Palace and Audience Chamber (with Han frozen there; he may not be moved while frozen).  Opponent may deploy up to 2 aliens to Audience Chamber.<br>
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain at Audience Chamber and you may not Force drain at Tatooine locations.  You may not play Frozen Assets.  Luke, R2-D2 and C-3PO are deploy -2 at Jabba's Palace sites (Master Luke deploys for free instead).<br>
Flip this card if Han is on Tatooine and not a captive.<br>
Place out of play if Tatooine is blown away.<br>
<br>
--Or Be Destroyed--<br>
Immediately retrieve 5 force (10 if Han has power &lt;4) once per game.<br>
While this side up, cancels game text of Bad Feeling Have I.  Your unpiloted starfighters may deploy to exterior Tatooine locations.  During your control phase, opponent loses 1 for for each battleground location occupied by Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, or your Lando.<br>
Flip this card if Han is captured or not on table.<br>
Place out of play if Tatooine is blown away.<br>
<br>
Again, we will methodically examine this objective.  Notice what you deploy (and what your opponent deploys) at the beginning of the game.  You deploy the Audience Chamber and the Tatooine: Jabba's Palace.	This provides you with five Force immediately, without any interference from the opponent.  However, I would also anticipate that we will see decks that start with another Tatooine site (or the system) plus Jabba's Palace (with Combat Readiness).  That start would effectively eliminate your advantage, since it deprives you of your Force and gives them the opportunity to deploy the Audience Chamber and an alien from reserve deck.  You also deploy a 'frozen' Han Solo there.  (Note this is much like the Rescue the Princess objective).  However, the one immediate problem we find is that the opponent is allowed to deploy up to 2 aliens there immediately.  I anticipate that a Dark Side player would probably deploy some sort of character combo, such as EPP Boba Fett and Jabba or Boelo and Jabba.  I suspect that Mara Jade might  also make an appearance. . .<br>
<br>
Let us examine the other parts of the first side.  The one benefit we find is that the opponent may not force drain at the Audience Chamber.  Another nicety is that Luke, C-3PO, and R2-D2 deploy for less; Master Luke even deploys for free!  While obviously this is cool text, it also prevents you from being choked by constant None Shall Passes, which will probably become staples for all new-school Jabba's Palace decks and the new objective, Court of the Vile Gangster.  The worst part about this, though, is that you cannot Force drain on Tatooine while this side is up.	The text may seem unfair, but its purpose is to prevent abuse of the objective from decks that only want to use the Audience Chamber for quick drains from Tessek, Bo'marr Monks, and the like.  Another thing to note is that Frozen Assets cannot be played.  By necessity, then, this means that Han has to be released FAST!  In fact, you flip your objective immediately when you free Han.<br>
<br>
So how are you going to free Han?  The first and most obvious way is through battling.	When you control the site, Han is released-- very simple.  However, most Dark Side players will put up more of a fight than that.  There are a few 'tricks of the trade' you can use that will facilitate a quick release.  Master Luke is definitely useful since you can send aliens back to your opponent's hand.  If using Mains is your strategy, you can utilize Leia and Someone Who Loves You.  [If Leia is present at a site where Han is captive, release Han]  Captive Pursuit is also quite useful-- all you have to do is win the battle (defined as having more power than the opponent) and Han is freed.   Another interrupt, Corellian Retort [USED: Search your Reserve Deck, take one Captive Fury or Captive Pursuit into hand and reshuffle. LOST: If a bounty hunter (or gangster) and Han are involved in the same battle, you may add one battle destiny (add two if gangster is Jabba)], can help you not only release Han, but defend him also.  If using droids suits your fancy, an Arc Welder on Artoo can be an asset.  In my opinion, using Captive Pursuit plus Corellian Retort is the most efficient form of 'captive retrieval.'<br>
<br>
Now we have flipped the objective-- Han has been freed!  Notice that you have one immediate result, which is retrieving 5 force (unless Han is power &lt;4, in that case you would retrieve 10).  I think, in fact, that it is best to give up either the Premiere Han Solo or TK-422 as a captive at the beginning of the game.  This retrieval offers you some good payback for temporary inability to Force drain.  However, you need to watch out for Secret Plans and Come Here You Big Coward.  You also have one new order of business: protecting Han Solo.  If he is lost, then you'll have to virtually start over, and you can't retrieve that Force a second time.  If Han is lost, though, all you have to do is deploy him again (unless he is captured) and your objective flips again.  If anything, you will want to keep your benefits of 'Or Be Destroyed.'  What are they?  First, the effects of Bad Feeling Have I are canceled.  Obviously, this gives you an advantage if Bad Feeling Have I is on the table.  You are also able to deploy starfighters to exterior Tatooine sites.  This allows you to protect Han more readily.  You can throw down a Millenium Falcon (the starfighter of choice these days), make Han a passenger, and he's safe for the game!  In my opinion, that is the best way of protection, since you don't have to worry about those annoying Bounty Hunter starships that bring much pain, namely Dengar In Punishing One and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.<br>
<br>
The best text, though, is that your opponent loses 1 for for each battleground location occupied by Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, or your Lando.  In effect, it is a Light Side Occupation card that can't be canceled!  I think it would be beneficial to use many defensive cards so you can spread your characters out and deal the opponent damage through 'Or Be Destroyed's' text.  Cards such as Rebel Barrier, It Can Wait, It's A Trap, Houjix, On the Edge (name a 7 and then lose the character, very simple), Hyper Escape (save that Han in the Falcon!), Narrow Escape, Fall Back, and I Have a Very Bad Feeling About This (A New Hope set) are quite powerful, now more than ever.   Combine these cards with Order To Engage and your opponent will not be very eager to attack you.<br>
<br>
Combatting specific decktypes, though, could become a problem.	How do you deal with Hunt Down, Operatives, and ISB Ops?  Good question.  For one thing, though your immediate retrieval will help, it won't be the solution.	Therefore, I believe that you need to have a retrieval strategy backing up the damage you deal.  The solution probably lies in using Tatooine Celebration, Harvest, or Nar Shadda Wind Chimes.	Using cards such as H'nemthe's, Bo'marr Monks, Eloms, and Arconas could benefit your strategy and possibly help you retrieve cards.	Undercover spies might be a good choice, too, since not only can they prevent drains, they also can cancel Visage of the Emperor and go into hiding!  Another interesting strategy that might work would be to use Ardon 'Vapor' Crell with Vaporators and Hydroponics Stations as a drain strategy.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down decks, with dueling and without, will be a challenge to play against.  They usually use many high-powered aliens, so freeing Han could be difficult.	In addition, you will also have to worry about Epic Duels against Luke and Obi-Wan.  Adding dueling protection is your best defense, as usual.	Your defensive cards will come in handy against this deck type.<br>
<br>
Operatives and ISB Ops could also be hard to beat, since they are still popular.  Your one advantage (mainly against Operatives, ISB might still use it) is the possibility that they won't deploy any aliens to the Audience Chamber, instead saving them for defense.  In this case, you can flip quickly and start draining like a madman.	Playing with A Gift is essential; I believe A Gift should probably be used in all 'You Will Profit...' decks.  Using the high-drain locations (Jundland Wastes, Cantina, etc.) and Bo'marr Monks will allow you to drain more freely.  Also, using the high-ability/power aliens such as Tawss Khaa can combat the Speed ISB decks that sometimes surface.  Ambush can also take out that lone 5D6-RA7 that is affecting your drains.  You would play similarly against the newer Dark Deal decks.<br>
<br>
There aren't a multitude of possibilities with You Will Either Profit By This/Or Be Destroyed, but I believe you have two obvious choices:<br>
<br>
Free Han and Battle-- Use the damage caused by Or Be Destroyed and Order To Engage to take out the opponent in different places, putting him on the defensive.	This is quite interactive, but a little risky because it won't necessarily work, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Free Han and Drain-- I believe this to be the more effective deck-type.  Utilize Tatooine for its draining potential and the damage you can cause from Or Be Destroyed.  Using Bo'marr Monks/Ardon Vapor Crell and defensive cards, you could cause a lot of damage. This strategy is susceptible to two popular decks: Hunt Down, ISB Ops.  However, you can maneuver around those problems with some good deck designing.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I will honestly say that this objective is probably not the best for the tournament scene at the moment.  Currently the Dark Side has the Light on the run from all the new and powerful Bounty Hunter ships and the new personas of the hunters themselves.  There are too many variables involved to effectively combat enough Dark decks to be competitive in the current tournament scene.  This could change after the release of even newer cards.  Nevertheless, this objective looks like fun.  Who knows, you might even create a deck in the process that'll beat anything!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
