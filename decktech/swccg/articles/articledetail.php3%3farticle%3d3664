Ok set aside the little fiasco with the hydroponics station, and SW: CCG is looking pretty good right now. Sure we still have the overpowered SE to deal with but all in all its not that bad. <br>
<br>
I mean after all DeckTech is now online and fully operational. Sure there are a few bugs to work out, but I think we put our best foot forward with the first issue and I am looking forward to more of them.<br>

------Card Review--------<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
As this is the first edition, i&#146;ll sum up what&#146;s going on here.  Players send me reviews of a specified card.  I compilate, review, try to draw some conclusions, and factor in my own feelings on the card.  I&#146;ll then write my review, follow by a reprint of all the reviews sent in.  I will try not to repeat too much stuff that is said in others, other than to summarize.  At the end, i&#146;ll try to think up some cards that could be useful with the reviewed card.  Thanks for reading, hopefully, we can get some good ideas out of all this.<br>

Note from Editor.  The card reviews will now be based on a 5 star rating loosely adapted from the Inquest star rating.  I like it because it can be defined so well.<br>
<br>
*****  Five stars - These are the cards you see in tournaments time and time again.  They are the best at what they need to do.  They can fit in nearly any deck, and generally have excellent stand-alone value.  ex. Darth Vader<br>
<br>
****   Four stars - These are also very good cards, but often are a notch below the quality of a five star card, or lose a lot of effectiveness without supporting cards.  Often seen in tournaments, but generally in specific deck types.  ex. How did we get into this mess?<br>
<br>
***    Three stars - These are average cards.  They may be important in very specific deck types, but generally have few outstanding capabilites and are not often seen in constructed decks, or are used mostly when an expansion first comes out.  Often can be useful in a sealed deck.  ex. astromech droids.<br>
<br>
**      Two stars - A poor quality card.  They are either too slow, too expensive, or have some kind of prohibitive drawback that makes them not very useful.  Often there are other cards that fulfill similar functions, but much better.  Almost never seen in a constructed deck, but in a sealed deck they might make it.  ex. Nikto<br>
<br>
*       One star - A useless card.  Often serves no particular use, or is very easily disrupted.  Never seen at tournaments.  ex. Ghoel<br>

Introduction:<br>
  DBO is an objective card from special edition.<br>
<br>
Text: <br>
Front:<br>
Deploy Dantooine System<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy from reserve deck 	to Dantooine one site or non-unique Rebel; Reshuffle.  At Dantooine locations, each Imperial is deploy +2.<br>
Flip this card if Rebels control at least three Dantooine sites and opponent controls no 	Dantooine locations.<br>
Place out of play if Dantooine is &quot;Blown Away&quot;.<br>
<br>
Back:<br>
While this side up, opponent&#146;s Force Drains are -1.  At Dantooine locations, each Imperial 	is deploy +2.  Your squadrons may deploy to Dantooine (deploy cost=squadrons power -3), 	are immune to attrition &lt; 4 and may draw one battle destiny if not able to otherwise.  Your 	force drains are +1 at systems where you have a squadron present.<br>
Flip this card if opponent controls at least two Dantooine locations.<br>
Place out of play if Dantooine is &quot;Blown Away&quot;.<br>
<br>
Summary. <br>
<br>
_____Dbo, like any complex card, has its strengths and weaknesses.  I&#146;ll start with the strengths.  Opponents force drains are -1 are very powerful, and imperials deploy +2 at dantooine sites helps secure the ground.  Also, Dantooine is a fairly secure starting location, and starting with a planet can have many advantages, such as starting with nightfall or having a planet out to put clouds on.  You can also deploy non-unique sites or rebels from the reserve deck, also a fairly useful ability, as you can quickly flush out your zero destiny draws and set up a force base early on.  However, the advantages you get when the objective flips are not really that powerful, other than the force drain -1.  Squadrons have a deployment restriction at Dantooine, hampering their combat usefullness.  Force drains +1 at systems with squadrons could be useful, but remember the card has to be flipped to deploy them or get a drain bonus.  And here-in I think lies the biggest drawback.<br>
<br>
_____Dbo is pretty easily disrupted.  It is not that hard to flip back over. The opponent need only control 2 Dantooine locations, be they non-unique locations of his or cloud sectors, or your own ground locations.  And once Dbo is flipped over, it is very difficult to flip back.  First of all, you have to spread out a fair amount on the ground, which is always dangerous.  And if you are planning on playing space, it is to say the least, very difficult, to balance a ground deck, and a space deck.  That being said, though, occupy the ground and one or two squadrons at kessel, kiffex and coruscant(drains of 4, 3 and 4) will spell quick doom for an opponent, even with force drains -1.  <br>
<br>
_____Furthermore, other deck types can perform similar operations better, namely Local Uprising / Liberation.  You still get the force drains -1, a matching operative is worth any 5 non-unique rebels you can name, you get force retrieval, locations come out while the objective is flipped, force drain +1 at sites with operatives, it is almost impossible to flip back over, etc,etc.  And if you&#146;re really into a space overpower deck, Hidden Base will get you out fast (although i really question the effectiveness of hidden base after the errata).  Finally, although it&#146;s obviously not in direct competion, Ralltiir Operations, is way better.  Compare - being able to deploy squadrons, as opposed to pulling out any card from the reserve deck!!!(endless demonic tutor), and adding to your battle destinies everywhere.  <br>
<br>
_____One final note, although this card seems not so hot now, it may change.  If Decipher, again reverses the ruling on Ryle Torsyn being able to add a drain to every Dantooine location (add 1 to each of your force drains at dantooine, strange wording) then I think this deck could be very viable for a quick spread out and drain.  I&#146;m looking at maximum drains of around 18 a turn with that.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:  <br>
<br>
_____Dbo&#146;s force drains -1 are definitely the strongest part of this card, keeping it from a one star rating.  However the ineffectiveness of it, especially compared to other objectives and deck types, makes it less than useful.<br>

Combos:<br>
(editor&#146;s note- take these with a grain of salt, We could punch holes in all of them, but let&#146;s take best point of view and have some fun)<br>
<br>
DBO + start with Goo-Nee-Tay.<br>
_____Vader deploys for 10, Tarkin for 8 at Dantooine.  Add a It&#146;s a Trap(immune to sense), and drive the other guy nuts, when he spends 20 force to deploy and initiate a battle against a lone rebel trooper at the Swamp.<br>
<br>
DBO + Mantellian Savrip.<br>
_____Having trouble controlling the ground, can&#146;t flip the objective?  Turn those now useless squadrons to Gold squadrons.  Let&#146;s see your opponent take down Obi when you are forfeiting X-wing assault squadrons for 12!<br>
<br>
DBO + clouds + maneuvering flaps.<br>
_____Big power in the clouds and on the ground.  Add an ASP for even quicker deployment, and to return those cars to the reserve deck at the end of the game.<br>
<br>
DBO + Ryle Torsyn+Gold 3<br>
_____Deploy of 2, retrieve one force, immune to attrition less than 4, power of 4 +destiny, drain at safe Dantooine.<br>
<br>
DBO + Ryle Torsyn+Gold 3+A re-reversal of decipher&#146;s ruling<br>
_____Deploy of 2, retrieve one force, immune to attrition less than 4, power of 4 +destiny, drain at safe Dantooine.  throw in a few clouds, a few hyperescapes,  a few It&#146;s a traps, and houjix, and drain the crap out of your opponent.  (Was going to play this deck.)<br>
<br>
from Travis<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Squadrons+Docking Repair<br>
Fighting in space will be very difficult for the Empire with high forfeiting squadrons 	regenerating.<br>
<br>
X-wing assault squadron + Organized attack + S-foils Now that&#146;s scary!  what&#146;re we talking a power of ...21 from each assault squadron!?!<br>

Review by Eric Olson<br>
<br>
Subject of Review: Dantooine Base Operations<br>
Overall rating: ** (two stars)  (note from editor - Eric originally gave a 3 out of 10 based on the intoductory 10 point scale. I am basically cutting it in half, and fitting it into the criteria mentioned at the top of the page.)<br>
<br>
_____In short, this card is nearly binder fodder because it breaks one of the<br>
cardinal rules of tourney level decks, don&#146;t play heavy space AND heavy<br>
ground.  In order to gain the benefits, you have to be playing large<br>
quantities of both systems and squadrons in order to get enough of them<br>
out, as well as maintaining a large ground presence in order to prevent<br>
flipping.<br>
<br>
_____But let&#146;s take a look at another reason why this card earns such a low<br>
rating.  The main benefit is it lets your squadrons deploy, but wait,<br>
they can only deploy to Dantooine.  What this means is the majority of<br>
your air force may only deploy to one system.  In other words, you won&#146;t<br>
win any major space battles because you have little &#146;beatdown&#146; capacity.<br>
<br>
_____Most of the other benefits this card gives is better done by other<br>
cards. Here&#146;s the list:<br>
<br>
1.  Opponent&#146;s force drains are -1.<br>
Generic operatives provides this bonus, and is a heck of a lot easier to<br>
keep flipped.<br>
<br>
2.  Immunity to attrition &lt; 4 and battle destiny if not able to<br>
otherwise.<br>
This provides the battle bonus for this deck.  If you want to do<br>
battling in space, use Hidden Base - Xwing swarm with Organized Attack. <br>
This provides far more battling bonus than this meager bonus.<br>
<br>
_____Alternatively, generic operatives are better than this, because they ADD<br>
a battle destiny, and with a dozen in the deck, who cares that they&#146;re<br>
not immune to any attrition.<br>
<br>
3.  Force drains are +1 with a squadron.<br>
Again, generic operatives provide this, and as a bonus, you never have<br>
to flip the objective <br>
<br>
_____Alternatively, EBO gives a bonus of +2 to drains, and provides battle<br>
bonuses to boot, and is only marginally harder to activate if you build<br>
your deck around it, and much harder to cancel.<br>
<br>
4.  Imperials are deploy +2 to Dantooine.<br>
Not bad, but it&#146;s only to support the above weak bonuses.<br>
<br>
5.  Once per turn, may deploy a non-unique rebel or generic site to<br>
Dantooine.<br>
<br>
_____The saving grace, as it provides a limited &#146;cheese&#146; theme of deploying<br>
rebel cadets and being able to play numbers, especially good in concert<br>
with 4 above.<br>
<br>
_____Now that we&#146;ve looked at the benefits, let&#146;s look at the requirements.<br>
To flip, we must control 3 sites with rebels, while preventing opponent<br>
from controlling any locations.  This is probably not too difficult with<br>
the +2 deploy for Imps, so I&#146;ll concede an easy initial flip.<br>
To keep flipped, we must prevent the opponent from controlling two<br>
locations.  Obviously, the opponent will not attempt to control the<br>
system, so let&#146;s just deal with the sites.  With your forces split<br>
between two fronts, you&#146;re basically playing with 1/2 a ground deck.  A<br>
dedicated dark ground deck has a &#146;full&#146; ground deck to deal with your<br>
forces.  Even given the &#146;terrain&#146; bonuses from the obvious generic sites<br>
of Forest/Swamp/Jungle, what are the odds of preventing a take over from<br>
the ground deck?  Slim to none.<br>
<br>
Some closing thoughts:<br>
_____A dedicated space deck will prey on your deployment restrictions to<br>
Dantooine, and be able to choose the places for major battles to take a<br>
place, thus minimizing your space bonuses.<br>
A dedicated ground deck will virtually always be able to flip the<br>
objective back due to your limited ground power.<br>
A dedicated clouds deck will drop two clouds on Dantooine and slaughter<br>
you in the clouds should you attempt a challenge.<br>
<br>

Card Review:  Dantooine Base Operations/More Dangerous Than You Realize<br>
	Travis John &quot;Salacious Crumb&quot; Willse<br>
	sal-crumb@geocities.com<br>
<br>
_____Dantooine Base Operations (R, Special Edition), arguably the least <br>
played of all 10 objectives currently in the game, is primarily an <br>
objective designed to enhance a rarely seen card subtype:  squadrons.  <br>
Squadrons, despite their high permanent pilot ability, cost-efficient <br>
movement and overall bang per card slot, are difficult to deploy (even <br>
with the advent of DBO), do not offer the movement flexibility of <br>
individual starships, and are prime targets for the arsenal of Dark <br>
starship weapons. An SFS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons (C, Special Edition) needs <br>
to draw only a 1 for destiny to cause a squadron of Y-wings to be <br>
immediately lost (a hefty loss).  Squadron cards themselves are also <br>
moderately difficult to obtain-the only two available for the Light Side <br>
are X-wing Assault Squadron (R, Special Edition) and Y-wing Assault <br>
Squadron (U1, A New Hope).  Despite these problems, DBO remains a card <br>
of high potential.<br>
<br>
_____Like its Dark sister Ralltiir Operations (R, Special Edition), DBO <br>
forces you to start with its corresponding system, and lets you deploy <br>
sites or non-unique Rebels from Reserve Deck to that system.  To aid in <br>
fulfilling the moderately difficult goal of controlling three Dantooine <br>
(U2, Premiere) sites with Rebels (while not allowing your opponent to <br>
control any), DBO has the added bonus of making Imperials deploy +2 to <br>
Dantooine locations.<br>
<br>
_____The flip side, however, is markedly different from its &quot;twin.&quot;  Aside <br>
from the powerful Force drain reduction (and retaining the added deploy <br>
cost for the opponent), DBO casts off many of the shackles that restrict <br>
squadrons.  Rather than Ralltiir Ops&#146; &quot;search for any card&quot; text, DBO <br>
lets X-wing and Y-wing squadrons deploy for 6 and 3 Force, respectively, <br>
to Dantooine (both great deploy-forfeit ratios), are granted immunity to <br>
attrition &lt; 4, guaranteed battle destiny draws and Force drain bonuses <br>
where present.<br>
<br>
_____Most Dark decks (even pure space decks) can&#146;t handle this kind of power.  <br>
Confrontation is much easier for the Light side with this cheap, <br>
recyclable space power.  On the off-chance that you do have to lose a <br>
squadron in battle, merely place it on a Docking And Repair Facilities <br>
(R, Special Edition) for a high-power card that, because of its <br>
asterisk-defined deploy cost, returns to your hand for free.  It gets <br>
even better with cards like Incom Engineer (C, Special Edition), <br>
Organized Attack (C, Special Edition) and S-foils (C, Special Edition).  <br>
Using the latter two of those makes each of your X-wing Assault <br>
Squadrons deploy 6, forfeit 12 and power 18.  For defense against the <br>
rare weapon-laden TIE decks, A Few Maneuvers (C, Premiere) is an <br>
excellent high-destiny defensive measure.  If the opponent is weak in <br>
space, or merely avoids you, take advantage with high drain systems.  A <br>
flipped DBO with squadrons at Coruscant (R, Special Edition) and Kessel <br>
(U2, Premiere) will net you drains of 4 at each of those locations.  <br>
Adding a squadron-controlled Kiffex (R, Jabba&#146;s Palace) gives a total <br>
drain of 11 per turn-amazing for a deck style not part of the modern <br>
metagame in most places.  Other space cards will mix well with DBO: <br>
Asteroid Sanctuary (C, Dagobah) and Kessel Run (R2, Premiere). Or, throw <br>
in A Gift (U, Jabba&#146;s Palace) and Artoo (R, Jabba&#146;s Palace) and deploy <br>
one of your compatible generic sites to your Jabba&#146;s Palace: Audience <br>
Chamber (U, Jabba&#146;s Palace) to reduce all of your opponent&#146;s Force <br>
drains by 2.  For true DBO decks, a 50/50 mix of space and ground (with <br>
a number of starfighters to provide pre-flip space power) should provide <br>
sufficient power in both places to create give a high probability of <br>
winning.<br>
<br>
_____DBO also works well in several decks where you do not intend to flip it. <br>
Its always functional deploy +2 cost for Imperials has great potential.  <br>
By replacing Bothawui Operatives (C, Special Edition) with Ithorians (C, <br>
Jabba&#146;s Palace), it can be used as an alternate objective for setting up <br>
a Droid Merchant (C, Special Edition) engine, a clouds deck (which <br>
actually mixes well with squadrons) or a Nabrun Leids / Beatdown deck.  <br>
The cost increase also serves insert decks well, whose characters are <br>
typically weaker than others.  For added protection, throw in Goo Nee <br>
Tay!  (R, Special Edition) and H&#146;nemthes (C, Jabba&#146;s Palace).  With <br>
these cards in effect, Imperial pilots of ability &gt; 2 are a prohibitive <br>
deploy +6 to Dantooine, while most other regularly used Dark side <br>
characters (save a few specialized aliens) are a restrictive deploy +2 <br>
or +4 to those sites.<br>
<br>
_____In conclusion, Dantooine Base Operations is an underrated card that, if <br>
you have the resources, makes an excellent alternative deck style often <br>
not considered by other.<br>

==========================================================<br>
<br>
Objective: Dantooine Base Occupation / More Dangerous Than You Realize<br>
<br>
Good<br>
Easy to flip to give +1 force drain for your squadrons at systems and -1<br>
drains everywhere for your opponent .<br>
<br>
Bad<br>
Too easy for opponent to stop objective flip or flip it back leaving a<br>
deck full of squadrons with nowhere to go.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
Has potential, but a successful deck is hard to construct, needs big<br>
helping of luck in a tournament.  This needs some help from future<br>
expansions to be a tournament winning objective.<br>

SWCCG Tournament Report-3/14/99<br>
On Sunday, March 14, 1999, 11 players met at Homefront Hobbies in Williamsport, PA for a Bespin &amp; Beyond Swiss Tournament. Two new players also attended to learn how to play the game.  I am hoping to help them construct decks so that they will be able to play at the next tournament in 2 weeks.  Thanks to all those players who donated their unwanted cards to these two new players.  <br>
<br>
I decided to try some new prize distribution methods, which included &quot;Bingo&quot; prizes with posters, stickers, and a pack for the lowest ranked game.  I opened the 7 packs of Japanese cards, and found both a LUKE SKYWALKER and OBI&#146;S LIGHTSABER!!!  I saved those two for special prizes at the end of the<br>
day, and had players choose a couple of the Japanese cards every time they completed one game.  The $3 entry fee was used to purchase prizes from the store owner at a nice discount. Thanks Brian!!<br>
<br>
We had two undefeated players, who never faced each other as they were both playing the same allegiance for the final game.  Congratulations to Ben Hughes, who took first place, using both a LS and a DS Operative deck.  Bryan Westerby was also undefeated, with a lower differential.  While his DS deck<br>
did use the Operative Objective, his LS deck did not contain an Objective, relying instead on the raw power associated with 19 Sandspeeders on steroids. Chad Chervinsky rose above the crowd to take 3rd place, his best showing ever.<br>
<br>
Results are below:<br>
<br>
Ben Hughes		8(+82)		DVDLOTS shirt, one JP pack<br>
Bryan Westerby		8(+62)		Veers shirt, one pack<br>
Chad Chervinsky		6(  +8)		Japanese Luke, 4 packs<br>
Carl Westerby           	4(+29)		SE Starter, one pack<br>
Matthew Kelley		4(+16)		5 packs<br>
Erin Westerby		4(-7)		5 packs<br>
Todd Kessler		4(-2)		Japanese Obi&#146;s LS, 4 packs<br>
Matt Bell			4(-47)		5 packs<br>
Garrett Stiger		2( -32)		5 packs<br>
Jason Sponhouse	2( -45)		5 packs<br>
Andrew Bell		2( -64)		EPP Vader, one pack<br>
<br>
Our prize support box was very lucky, with LUKE SKYWALKER, DARTH VADER, and a GRAND MOFF TARKIN pulled from the packs. Thanks for attending--and we hope to see some of the new players in a couple weeks.<br>

SWCCG Tournament Report-2/6/99<br>
On Saturday, February 6, 1999, 13 players met at Homefront Hobbies in Williamsport, PA for a Sanctioned Swiss Tournament.  The Dark Side continued to dominate, winning 67% of the games (16 out of 24).  Operative decks seemed to be the most successful this week, although other successful strategies<br>
included Hidden Base, ISB Operations, and Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi.<br>
<br>
The award for furthest distance traveled to the tournament should be given to Edward Wearne, who traveled almost 4 hours from Pittsburgh to join us.  We also had a special appearance from Matt Bell, who hasn&#146;t played at many of our recent tournaments. Matt Seeley, playing in his first tournament, did very<br>
well, winning two out of four games.<br>
<br>
 For a change, the extra-large T-shirt was appropriately sized for the champion (our younger players usually swim in those shirts!)  Congratulations, Bryan!  Again, we used the $3 entry fee to purchase additional prize support from the proprietor of Homefront.  Results are listed below:<br>
<br>
1.      Bryan Westerby	8(+59)		Jabba T-shirt,1 SE pack<br>
2.      Carl Westerby	6(+58)		EPP Vader<br>
3.      Ben Hughes	6(+54)		EPP Obi-Wan<br>
4.      Edward Wearne	6(+34)		1 SE pack, 3 packs Premiere<br>
5.      Matthew Kelley	6(+19)		1 SE pack, 3 packs Premiere<br>
6.      Robert Bustin	4(+35)		1 SE pack, 3 packs Premiere<br>
7.      Matt Bell		4(-4)		4 packs Premiere<br>
8.      Todd Kessler	4(-17)		4 packs Premiere<br>
9.      Matt Seeley		4(-20)		4 packs Premiere<br>
10.     Andrew Bell	2(-24)		4 packs Premiere<br>
11.     Jason Sponhouse	2(-49)		4 packs Premiere, Boba Fett Sticker<br>
12.     Chad Chervinski	2(-59)		4 packs Premiere, Boba Fett Sticker<br>
13.     Nathan Pish	2(-86)		3 packs Premiere, Boba Fett Sticker<br>

Michael Josem<br>
==========================================================<br>
The tourney had around 18 or so players, which was nice, but none of the other more experienced players were playing or even there.  I think my ranking would be around 2-300 more than any elses, so I was kinda disappointed with that.<br>
<br>
My DS deck was a HDADTJ deck using Dr.Evazans and Disarmeds and Elises and Darths and EPP Bobas.<br>
<br>
My LS deck was a Hidden Base deck with EPP guys and some drain 2 locations on the ground in case I came across SFS.<br>
<br>
Game 1, my DS vs a newbie<br>
As my pairing was announced, a whole lot of people were telling me to go easy on the kid.  He was playing with the MPGs as his starting location, and therefore got out the fourth marker.  My first hand landed me with POTF, Choking Vader and Vader&#146;s Stick.  I felt kinda guilty as I plonked Vader down while carefully explaining what each and every card down for an effective drain of 5 (the three at the 4th, and 2 to VOTE).  A solitary rebel guard threw himself in front of Vader, with a 2/2 pilot at the Snow Trench on my opponent&#146;s turn.  Tarkin joined Darth and made short work of the single rebel guard, and I was basically draining for 2 a turn, until<br>
Bane and the Downtown Plaza arrived.  Bane helped chasing the pilot, until he decided to leave this 2/2 pilot in front of Vader and Tarkin.  I asked why he did that, and he said that it was because  I&#146;ll just keep chasing the 2/2 pilot.  I carefully explained that I was chasing him in the hope I caught him, and pounded him.  I was more than willing to allow the 2/2 guy to move away (hey, I guess I&#146;m just a nice bloke :)  Soon after this, another 2/2 pilot (a SE one, I think) turned up at the Downtown Plaza, and after getting Tarkin + Darth out from under the shields, I teleported to the DP and pounded that pilot too.  Game Over.  After the game, I helped<br>
him out a bit with basic stuff (think things through a bit more), and gave him some cards from my trade folder I didn&#146;t need (Tarkin, Motti, Djas Puhr, Off the Edge) and he wanted.  <br>
<br>
Big win - 38ish<br>
<br>
Game 2, my LS vs an older newbie<br>
This guy was playing an odd ISB deck that might have worked if it was better :)  Basically, he started with the Coruscant location which allows you to add a destiny to power if you&#146;ve got a general there.  I was pretty quick in getting out all my systems, and draining a fair bit before he eventually got a Probe Droid down to the Imperial Square (?) and Veers followed soon<br>
after. I did have trouble finding Kessel (it seemed to have stuck itself to another card) which might have mattered in another game, but here it didn&#146;t.  I flipped anyway, and was draining nicely, when he got a probe droid antenna onto the probe droid, and a dune walker at the jungle on Bothawui he&#146;d deployed.  I sent Luke and Han and some others to bash on the dune walker,<br>
and Obi and Harc Seff joined for the beat down on Veers + Probot. Later in the game, he flipped the objective on his second last turn, which was kinda cute, so I nabruned and knocked off Piett sitting by himself, which speeded things up considerably.  <br>
<br>
Big win - 30ish<br>
<br>
Game 3 (?), my LS vs a Knowledge + Defense CHYBC Nal Hutta Ops deck. I was surprised to see this deck today, since I hadn&#146;t expected much info from this listserv to get there.  Never mind, I figured I should be able to beat it.  Harc Seff went sick down on Nal Hutta blocking a drain, two<br>
from Hidden Base, often one to Rebel fleet, and every now and then he got a drain off.  He was slow in flipping his objective, which helped me, but I was cancelling enough drains for it to not be such a problem.  On his second last turn, he only had 3 Operatives left, and had just inserted K+D into my deck.  I had already had Han and stick on Nal Hutta, and here was my play of the day:<br>
Han and Harc Seff at Jungle.  His Operative moved to there, along with a Dune Walker, and Jabba (?).  Anyway, the Operative stayed outside.  I battled, hit the operative, and he lost it as a result of the battle, I didn&#146;t lose much at all.  On my next turn, I activated lots, and set<br>
off K+D, flipping his objective back (he no longer had the 3 battlegrounds - there were no battlegrounds).  I proceded to cancel most of his drains, and then it was my turn.  I activated, drained for 3 at Kessel, 3 at Coruscant, 2 at Kiffex, and 1 at a couple of other systems, at which point he said &#146;oh, I forgot to flip my objective back (K+D had finished)&#146;  I pointed out<br>
that he no longer controlled 3 battleground sites with operatives.  I then counted out a small win by 9 or so force. <br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4, my DS vs a Bothawui Ops deck.<br>
I got Vader with Lightsaber, Dr. Evazan, Boba with Gun and Tarkin out all pretty early, and they Elised all over the place beating up on stuff (Dr.E and two guns works really nicely) by disarming and operating on any EPP mains and then just hitting and operating on operatives, often leaving a cloud car or something to receive the brunt of the damage.  He soon ran<br>
out of Houjixs, and though he did get a couple of big drains off (TGM, Clouds,<br>
Ops = drain of 5), I just Elised and won through battle damage.  If he had a<br>
QAM or a few Sic-Six he would have easily won.  Nice win - 25ish force<br>
<br>
Game 5, my DS vs a deck I can&#146;t remember.<br>
I played incredibly poorly this game even though I came out with a win, and can&#146;t remember much else. <br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6, my LS vs a TIE SFS deck.<br>
I also played really poorly and stupidly here, thinking I had Yarna in play when I had Signalled for an S-Foils upon seeing his Starting Location. It was just a farce, and I was fortunate to be able to deploy some ground locations to drain at, while he deployed no locations until late in the game when he deployed the Hoth system.  I was Nabrunning all over the place, trying to kill off Choking Darth and deploy Han with gun 3/4 times (retrieval and Tacta Bank) and Luke 5 (Tacta Bank and multiple copies). <br>
<br>
It was just a farce to watch the game really, but I snuck out with a small win. Next time, I&#146;m going to have to build a more reliable LS deck (I&#146;d thought that Ops would be popular, and hence SFS decks wouldn&#146;t be in the top bracket with me, and therefore wouldn&#146;t be a problem.  Unfortunately, they were :)  It was simply a case of bad and misjudged metagaming.<br>
<br>
<br>
I ended up winning the tourney undefeated, and won a Boba Fett T-Shirt for my efforts, and a couple of rares too.  First time I&#146;ve been undefeated in a Star Wars tourney which was something to be proud of, but none of the top players were there.  Oh well, a win&#146;s a win!<br>

Now a few articles about what to include in your tournament report. You should read them over before you submit your next TR.<br>
<br>

==========================================================<br>
<br>
The first thing that should be a tourney report (after stating where it was played, and what type of tournament it was) is a brief description of<br>
the types of decks and the strategies they used. They could also include the list of cards in their deck if they like (maybe put it at the end of the<br>
tourney report). Then follow the usual procedure summarizing each game, with the player&#146;s score after each game. I think a good idea is to include the &quot;highlights&quot; and &quot;lowlights&quot; of each game as I have enjoyed them in other tourney reports. Any additional comments from the player about the tournament is good as well. <br>
<br>
Good luck with the newsletter. I think it will be a success.<br>

As this is the first edition, i&#146;ll sum up what&#146;s going on here.  Players send me miscelaneous articles relating to SW:CCG.  I compilate, review, try to draw some conclusions. This time we see a strong showing of strategy articles. Since there are so many next issue will have its own column called Strategy. There are a few mentions of meta analysis as well so I am toying with the thought of having a meta column too. Enjoy the articles. They don&#146;t neccesarily reflect my own opinions but I have been wrong plenty of times. Use your brain and try to find something here you can apply to your game.<br>

A. Sujdak&#146;s on &quot;How to solve for the assymetric case&quot;<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
____In previous ramblings by A. Sujdak, a systematic framework of assumptions was provided for exploring metagames of a symmetric type.  Below is a brief sketch of things to come in my research of how to solve for the assymetric case, and also a pseudo proof of the solubility of an assymetric meta.<br>
<br>
____Let the lowercase w after a decktype denote that decktype&#146;s aggregate winning percentage--i.e., its winning percentage if it were to play onegame against each opponent in the entire field.  Also let the lowercase pafter a decktype denote its proportion of the total field. Let the light side decktypes be represented by L1, L2, etc. and let the dark side decktypes be represented by D1, D2, etc. Lastly, let the metagame winning percentage matrix be represented byM[a,b], where the value of the matrix at any particular coordinate is the percentage of time that decktype a defeats decktype b.<br>
<br>
____Unlike A. Sujdak&#146;s first Equilibrium Theory, it must be additionally assumed that players do not take expected margins of victory into account when they decide which deck to play. We then arrive at the following system of linear equations: <br>
<br>
LNw = Lw for all N <br>
<br>
DIw = Dw for all I <br>
<br>
____This is an extension of the normal equilibrium theory.  It can no longer be assumed that decks are bound to a fifty percent winning percentage, because it is possible to have a stable meta in which light (dark) wins morethan dark (light).  The new restriction is simply that all decks on the sameside of the force must have the same winning percentage.  If this were not true then the number of people playing the deck with the best winning percentage characteristics would increase and either it would be hosed and dragged back down to the same win character as the other decktypes or no counter would exist in which case all players would play that decktype. These sets of restrictions give (total number of decktypes) minus two equations. <br>
<br>
sum(LNp) over N = 1 <br>
and <br>
sum(DIp) over I = 1 <br>
<br>
____This gives two more equations which basically define the decktype populations as representing that percentage of the field which plays a particular decktype.  The restriction obviously comes from the fact that as more people play one decktype the number of people playing other decktypes on that side of the force must decrease. <br>
<br>
sum(M[ i, j ] * Ljp) over j = Diw and sum(M[ i, j] * Djp) = Liw <br>
<br>
____This gives one equation for each decktype basically stating that the aggregate win percentage for a deck is a linear summation of its winning percentages against opposing decktypes times their frequency in themeta. This system of equations gives two equations for each decktype.  Since we have two descriptors for each decktype, aggregate winning percentage and population, we have arrived at a solvable system of equations (assuming that none of the boundedness restrictions is violated, in which case asolution is still possible but will be dynamic and non-deterministic in nature).<br>
<br>
____The real trick in arriving at a succesful adaptation of Eq. Theory was to find a way to state the equilibrium condition.  It took a fair amount of time on the part of the author to see the new winning conditions.  I then nearly overlooked the population restriction equations and was ready to write an article stating that assymetric metas were insoluble! Fortuneatly, I developed a brain at the last minute and you have the masterpiece(hehehe) that you see before you.  Honestly, I&#146;m not sure how easy it will be to obtain a deterministic solution but I&#146;m hoping for the best. <br>
<br>
I haven&#146;t had much time to probe into empirical validation, either, because I had a birthday yesterday.  Surprise parties ruin your work plans.<br>
<br>
In any case, to give some sort of real-world applicability to what you see above, I see the current metagame as consisting of the following:<br>
<br>
LS:  HB X-wing, Maelstrom, Bothan Ops<br>
DS:  ISGhhhk, SFS, HDADTJ<br>
<br>
____I know that multiple variants exist of each of these decktypes, but they have similiar performance characteristics.  Furthermore I do not believe that there is a significant population of decks that exist completely outside the above meta.  With three general decktypes on each side of the force, all that really needs to be done is to find M, the win matrix,and it SHOULD be possible to predict the stable population of each decktype. With a relatively simple meta like above it will be interesting to see how well the theory agrees with the empirical findings (i.e., global popularities of each of the different decktypes).<br>

____Recently on the Listserve I&#146;ve heard a little debate going back and forth about the benefits of Reactor Terminal/Traffic Control.  Some people put these cards in every deck because they help get unwanted cards out of your hand, recycle high destiny, protect you from Monnok/Grimtassh etc. While others argue that these 2 cards give you a false sense of safety and allow you to overdraw in order to find them, and wreck you if you don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
____I haven&#146;t put a Reactor Terminal in my deck for quite a few months. Traffic control made a cameo in my Dagobah training deck due to the high number of useless destiny 7s in that deck, but it hasn&#146;t been in any of my other decks.  I follow the belief that you should never draw up so many cards that not having a Traff/Term will leave you with very little force.  I always try to keep my hand under 12 cards when possible.  Not having those cards hasn&#146;t really affected my games that much.<br>
<br>
Secret Tech: <br>
____I first saw an Ishi Tib being played by another highly skilled player in my area.  For those of you who don&#146;t know what an ishi tib does, it is an LS non-unique (3 dots) alien, power and ability = 1 (but armor = 3) that deploys for 2. Destiny 3, and during your draw phase, allows you to put one card from you hand at the bottom of your used pile, and draw a card.  At first glance a pretty useless card, but if you play with it for a while, you realize that its ability is awesome.  In my decks that don&#146;t contain Traffic Control, this card is almost always in and serves the same functions.  It helps protect me from monnok, allows me to recycle that useless Don&#146;t forget the droids, etc.  About the only thing that it doesn&#146;t do is boost my differential at the end of a game.<br>
<br>
____Term/Control also serves a different purpose.  In a tournament game, it allows you to put your entire hand in your used pile at the end of the game to boost your differential.  This is a really attractive part of Term/control, and has helped many players needing differential, but I&#146;ll tell you why I don&#146;t use it.  First, if you win all of your games, differential matters very little.  While I realize that this is not always possible, I try my hardest to win first and worry about differential later.  Second, you opponent, if they are a tournament veteran, will pick up on what you&#146;re trying to do and simply draw up a turn before you drain them to death, making Term/control pointless. Third, and the deciding factor for me, is that when I&#146;m making a deck, there are always a couple more &quot;cool&quot; cards that I want to throw in,and this doesn&#146;t leave any room for recyclers. <br>
<br>
____I hope this article has been somewhat helpful. I guess I am of the opinion that Traffic Control and Reactor Terminal aren&#146;t necessary in most decks and can be replaced by more useful cards.<br>

Michael Girard &quot;Destiny 7 Madness&quot;<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
____&quot;I&#146;ll pay one to initiate battle, I draw a 3 for destiny, you draw a.....7, ouch that is gonna hurt.&quot;  Or maybe you have seen this happen, &quot;Drain for two, pay one, counter assault you have who there?  Han, Luke, Leia and a talz, Ok, destiny, 7,7,7,7.  That is 28 to 10, lose 18 cards or over a quarter of your deck!&quot;  <br>
<br>
____These types of exchanges are becoming more and more common these days.  Since the objectives came out, themes like Jedi Training don&#146;t need as many doubles as before so there are now open slots forcards. There are a good number of people turning to destiny 7 cards to fill those slots.  With Mind What You Have Learned/Save You It Can, you can pull Yoda and Son of Skywalker (SOS) out of your deck so you don&#146;t need to run multiples of each.  With these slots opening up you need to find a card or group of cards that makes your opponent lose force or that prevent you from losing force.  With cards such as Counter and Surprise Assault, in the past these have been used sparingly because you didn&#146;t have a good ration of destinies because your deck was packed full of characters.  <br>
<br>
____Now it is not uncommon to see a Jedi Training or Hunt Down deck with multiples of Counter and Surprise Assaults.  These cards have increased in playing ability do to the fact that the overall average destiny number in your deck has risen exponentially.  This &quot;combo&quot; makes your opponent wary of draining, so in turn you are both preventing force loss (loss of drain) and dealing damage (counter/surprise assault).  And besides who couldn&#146;t use another destiny seven in their deck.<br>
<br>
____Now the ways to beat are plentiful.  First and foremost there is always Sense, but since they are probably going to be playing with Mind what you have Learned or Hunt down, the drawing of a successful sense is small, unless you have a Jedi in play.  Some other ways of dealing with this is &quot;catch&quot; cards (What are you trying to push on us/There&#146;ll be hell to pay). Every time they play a counter/surprise assault is pulled from their deck and placed here and they have to pay an additional one each time.  Now this is a viable counter, but by the third or fourth one of these, the damage they have inflicted will be devastating.  Another way of dealing with this theme is Grimnok (Grimtaash/Monnok).  Since they will have multiple 7 destiny cards there will more then likely be doubles in their hand. And finally the most viable (I feel) counter is Ability X3/Civil Disorder. Since they have so many non-character cards, they will plenty of time sweating these effects.<br>
<br>
____So in conclusion, this deck archetype will probably rear it&#146;s ugly head here shortly on the tournament scene.  Below is a rough sketch of a Jedi training deck. Deck List <br>

Introduction:<br>
____A recent concern in the Star Wars community has been the rise of decks that use swarms of non-unique cards, getting away from Main characters and the &quot;spirit of Star Wars&quot;.  Likewise, many current deck designs are non-interactive, and focus on force draining the opponent to death while making it difficult to battle and do damage (Operatives, ISB Operations, Hidden Base).  Here&amp;#8217;s an aggressive deck that makes use of some Mains and takes the fight to the opponent.  It&amp;#8217;s probably not the design I would take to a major tournament, but it does extremely well in local play.  More importantly, its a design that emphasizes Main characters and encourages the dark side to battle.  An analysis of the deck elements follows the deck list.<br>
<br>
Objective (1):<br>
Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi<br>
<br>

<br>

Vader with Saber x 2<br>
Grand Moff Tarkin x 2<br>
Outer Rim Scout x 2<br>
Boba Fett with Blaster<br>
Jabba<br>
Boelo<br>
Chall Bekan<br>
Dr Evazan<br>
Bubo<br>
<br>
Weapons, Vehicles and Starships (7):<br>
Vader&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber x 2<br>
Blizzard 2<br>
Bossk in Hound&amp;#8217;s Tooth x 2<br>

Jabba&amp;#8217;s Space Cruiser<br>
<br>

Monnok x 5<br>
Masterful Move x 2<br>
Holonet Transmission<br>
Alter x 5<br>
Evader<br>
Sniper<br>
Shocking Revelation<br>
Twilek Advisor x 2<br>
Torture x 2<br>
<br>
Effects (5):<br>
Visage of the Emperor x 2<br>
Broken Concentration<br>
Reactor Terminal<br>
Secret Plans<br>
There&amp;#8217;ll Be Hell to Pay<br>
<br>
Locations:<br>
____The idea behind this deck is to play against your opponent, preferably on their locations.  My area is rife with Operatives, and most Operative decks provide 2 force on your first turn, allowing the 6 force necessary to drop Vader on their starting location (which is generally the Farm) and flip the Objective on the first turn.<br>
<br>
____The locations are geared towards safe activation - the Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace sites and Imperial Holotable are all immune to Revolution.  In an area where Revolution is heavily played, I would increase the number of Evaders in the deck and add more locations for force generation. Currently, the 7 sites is enough, as Operatives and Hidden Base tend to provide quite a bit of quick force to the Dark Side.  Masterful Move and the Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace game text also allow some sites to come out of the deck.  Don&amp;#8217;t forget the additional activation at the Holotheater once Vader is on the table.<br>
<br>
Characters:<br>
____Its important early in the game to read the opponent&amp;#8217;s deck and come up with a game plan.  Against Operatives, I tend to deploy Vader immediately, and then begin developing &amp;#8216;hit squads&amp;#8217; - Vader/Tarkin, Vader/Evazan, Boba Fett/Evazan, Chall Bekan/Boelo, Jabba/Boelo, Blizzard 2/ORS, etc - there are many combinations of  these characters that are effective in battle.<br>
<br>
Green and Blue Cards:<br>
____This is certainly not enough ships to effectively battle a Hidden Base deck.  However, it is possible to probe with 4 ships, especially under the new HB rules.  Bossk in Hound&amp;#8217;s tooth is key because of the added destiny.<br>
<br>
Interrupts:<br>
____The interrupts are geared towards defeating a non-unique deck.  Alter and Monnok are the main ingredients; get rid of pitch effects (ie, Bargaining Table) and Yarna, and then go to town with the Monnoks. Against an Operative deck, the constant pressure of Vader draining and battling on the Operative planet, along with Visage loss and Monnok, is overwhelming.  I would employ a similar strategy vs Hidden Base - use speed to begin the damage early, bolstered by Monnok.  As the opponent spreads to make Hidden Base active, he becomes vulnerable to some of the light space elements in the deck.<br>
<br>
____As for other interrupts, Shocking Revelation will be discussed in conjunction with Secret Plans (below).  Holonet Transmission protects the Visage against Termination and makes an additional hologram for the Holotable.  Torture is anti-inserts - I find that whenever you assume you won&amp;#8217;t face any inserts and take out your insert protection, you play against all numbers decks.  It&amp;#8217;s a law.  Torture and Don&amp;#8217;t Forget the Droids belong in most Mains decks.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
____I start with Secret Plans.  Not only does retrieval overcome the early fast damage that Visage inflicts, but the ability to pull Shocking Revelation (and recycle it) each turn is very useful.  The keys to getting this deck moving fast are:  Vader in the opening hand and a battleground site to deploy him.  If either of these elements are not present, the recycling Shock can let you deduce the contents of your active force pile, allowing you to judiciously draw up force or leave it (of course, you need to know the deck contents well, but that should be a given). This maximizes the decisions you make early in the game. <br>
<br>
____For instance, if I don&amp;#8217;t have a Vader in the opening hand or force pile, I may look to the next option&amp;#8230; perhaps an early Monnok.  Likewise if the opponent starts Goo Nee Tay to slow Vader down a little.<br>
<br>
____The other effect that bears a close look at is Broken Concentration. Against a training deck, of course this is a useful starting effect. However, it also warrants a card slot as a defensive card.  The pay to move a force back onto opponent&amp;#8217;s force pile is extremely effective against cards that require force to be saved up - It&amp;#8217;s a Trap, Quite a Mercenary, What&amp;#8217;re You Trying to Push on Us, especially when you have prior knowledge of the opponent&amp;#8217;s hand with a Monnok and know what the force is being saved up for&amp;#8230; at that point, drop Broken Concentration and go to town.<br>
<br>
____The second Visage is important if your original is cancelled; the steady Visage damage is a constant poke, and will be the deciding factor in a long, defensive game.  Because of the popularity of Transmission Terminated, I tend to pull Holonet Transmission early on with a Masterful Move as added protection.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
____This deck has a lot of room for variance based on your local tournament scene.  As mentioned, this version is designed to face off against Operatives, and to provide an interactive, aggressive experience beating on those nasty little shadows on the Operative planet. Character removal in battle (using Vader&amp;#8217;s choke, Evazan&amp;#8217;s game text, or You Are Beaten) is useful in avoiding extra battle destinies provided by the Operative or an Epp combo.  Some improvements would be making room for an additional Elis Helrot, or adding another grabber card, like There&amp;#8217;ll Be Hell to Pay.  Against a field with a lot of X Wing swarm decks, add a Ghhhk to be pulled out with Masterful Move.<br>
<br>

David Destefanis &quot;The Defensive Strategy&quot;<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
____The Defensive player is the nemesis of the Offensive player: he first build defenses, then attack his opponent when he feels/is safe from any countermeasure. This is somehow much more difficult to do efficiently than to jump early on your opponent to kill him. Thus, good and winning defending decks are somewhat rare in the tournament scene. But since the first player&amp;#8217;s fear is to lose, many tend to begin their tournament experience as Defensive players.<br>
	<br>
____In the end, an usual SW:CCG player has decks with a versatile and general defense capability and a much more pronounced offense part (which will result to be his deck strategy).<br>
<br>
What are the basis of the Defensive Deck ?<br>
<br>
1)	Locations: Defensive decks don&amp;#8217;t have that many location, so you won&amp;#8217;t see a Def. Deck with 10 locations. This is because the more locations you put inside your deck, the more your opponent will be able to drain you if these are on table; then, you waste precious card space better used elsewhere. The average number is between 6 to 8.<br>
<br>
2)	Characters/starships/vehicles : here there is also an upper limit, because the deck purpose is not to control every location in the game, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that a defensive deck has a lower average number of ch/st/veh, just that they will be very different from an usual type of deck, with roles pretty much defined within the deck&amp;#8217;s strategy.<br>
<br>
3)	Interrupts/Effects: these are the core components of the Defensive deck, and range from pure defensive ones, like Wars Not Make One Great/Narrow Escape to more nasty damaging ones like Uncontrollable Fury/Surprise Assault. Most Defensive decks also count on regeneration methods like Kessel Run/Off The Edge, since it is likely that in the overall the Defensive deck will be dealt more damage than the opponent&amp;#8217;s one.<br>
<br>
4)	At least 1 offensive tactic to damage the opponent (since the Time Win isn&amp;#8217;t what players are looking for).<br>
<br>
5)	A well, thoroughly studied game plan. If you stay on the defensive, you let players develop their strategies, so you had better have a solid game plan if you are to survive to the opponent&amp;#8217;s constant attentions. Thus, a Defensive deck needs much more refining than other decks.<br>
<br>
What are the basis of a GOOD Defensive Deck ?<br>
<br>
____Method 1: the Defensive deck doesn&amp;#8217;t care what the opponent do, since it will be able to recover from even the sturdiest attack with Force Retrieval. This usually means a good retrieval method, the more foolproof possible, and a heavy one also. These decks usually concentrate on their retrieval capability and damage the opponent in an also safe way (and slow, like Holo-drain). Just why they prefer slow and safe methods is not really difficult to guess: these decks usually cannot spare more than a few card slots to pure offensive strategies, so the player doesn&amp;#8217;t want to gamble on the security of those cards. <br>
An example of an average method 1 deck would be the All Droid/Numbers with Off The Edge. In this case, the defending player will have to protect Artoo from destruction (here go a few interrupts) to play Off The Edge on Cloud City, will have to somehow counter huge drain with Surprise Assaults, and damage the opponent with insert effects (and Surprise Assault) while making them appear on the top of the opponent&amp;#8217;s Reserve Deck with cards such as CC: Sabaac (use Retractable Arm on a R2-unit), Beru Stew, Blue Milk, Recoil In Fear, or Wars Not Make One Great. The main problem, however, is the gamble factor: the Surprise Assault may work once, but it is not a foolproof tactic, and insert effects don&amp;#8217;t tell you if they are going to show at the top of your opponent&amp;#8217;s deck before you are dead; also, counter exist. This deck is too much unreliable to be useful at top-level competition.<br>
A good example of a good method one deck would be the Mind What Have You Learned/Save You It Can deck. Yes, this is the famous deck nobody plays but everyone wants to hear about (or at least see a good one). The deck, with all its data, will be posted separately.<br>
	<br>
____Method 2: the Defensive decks cares what the opponent do, and change its tactic accordingly. This kind of deck deliberately leaves the initiative to the opponent and mold itself to partially/totally shut it down, and then damage him where he is not so well prepared to have a confrontation. In this case, the Defensive deck has riskier offensive methods than the method 1 deck, because he has more cards on his offensive strategy list and knows the opponent has already spent most of his elsewhere. So when this decks kicks in, he will damage the other one badly each turn without too much fear of retaliation, while blocking the other&amp;#8217;s drains nearly everywhere else. The Baragwin deck was a perfect pre-SE example of a good method 2 deck, but other could also be more fight-oriented, without retrieval methods but more characters/spies/landing claws/starships. Narrow Escape is a card to build decks upon, now that S/A/C are no more so predominant.<br>
	<br>
____Method 3: it is a much more personal method/approach. Before continuing on, let&amp;#8217;s see together what you can possibly do in a SW: CCG game, and what would you like to be able to do:<br>
<br>
1)	You would like to know the composition of the opponent&amp;#8217;s deck, and possibly in the details. It may be crucial to know if your opponent has or has not a particular counter(s) to your strategy.<br>
<br>
2)	You would like to be able to have all your needed cards in hand. This doesn&amp;#8217;t rely only on luck.<br>
<br>
3)	You would like to be protected from any nasty/broken/predominant deck strategy out there.<br>
<br>
4)	You would like to be lucky. J Well, this is scientifically impossible to achieve, but the Force is here, believe me&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
5)	You could heavily damage your opponent.<br>
<br>
6)	You could quickly and without much risks retrieve Force.<br>
<br>
7)	You would like to win with huge differentials most of the time, so as not to worry about differential issues in tournament.<br>
<br>
8)	The Force is your ally, so the less you squander, the best it would be, but is that possible ? This may seems a card efficiency problem, but there is more than meets the eye.<br>
<br>
9)	You would like to have many different nasty cards/tricks, but also to be somewhat sure to play them during the game.<br>
<br>
10)	You would like to have fun and have a challenge.<br>
<br>
11)	(And last) You would like to see your opponent lose by his own hands. (This is a more personal opinion)<br>
<br>
____Well, all the last 11 points are possible to accomplish, but usually not all 11 together (if you still want to win).<br>
<br>
____Strange as it may seems, my DDM&amp;#8217;s LS Deck accomplishes them all. As I won the &amp;#8217;98 Chandrilla Regional thanks to it, this is not idle chatter. This is what I call a close-to-perfection method 3 deck. Method 3 decks are decks that escape the bounds of logic, and so work with the same efficiency nearly all the time, and also seem to take advantage from the opponent knowing its composition. (I would even think they work best (=safely) when the opponent already dealt with it and lost). The DDM&amp;#8217;s LS Deck will also be posted elsewhere (for space issues).<br>
<br>
____Conclusion: The Defensive Option is maybe, on the paper, the strongest one. But games aren&amp;#8217;t won on Defense alone. So each Defensive deck has to contain some Offensive elements. The reverse is not true, however, and this is what makes Offensive decks (in general) more efficient: they are quicker, nastier, and usually card-efficient. Now, with all the different deck types out there (and with all the different viable offensive strategies), it is much more difficult to be ready to face them all. <br>
<br>
____Even so, Defensive decks usually have always the means to win a particular game. To find out, usually, players use a term: the &amp;#8220;turning point&amp;#8221;. The turning point happens when the Defensive deck kicks in: i.e. when the player manages to get his strategy going. At this point, the Defensive player usually is able to mount a come back through Force retrieval or to block damage to his deck altogether. This usually means the end of the opponent&amp;#8217;s chances of winning. But the turning point is not easy to accomplish (especially in SE), because of the possible early damage the Defensive deck could take. Somehow, especially if the damage is high, it is possible for the Defensive deck to lose some crucial cards to its strategy and not to be able to retrieve them afterwards.<br>
<br>
____This is why Defensive decks tend to lose in harsh tournaments. Another reason is that the same defending players are &amp;#8220;bored&amp;#8221; to see that they have to quicken their deck to reach the turning point (which usually means less deck versatility in the overall defense). But defensive decks are not dead, and they will continue to appear on the tournament scene.<br>

_____The future is looking bright for Team DeckTech. I had hoped to write a article about how to prepare for your regional qualifiers. But wisdom prevailed and I decided it should go out in the next issue insted. The article will contain theories about the &#146;Peak Performance&#146; phenomenom that hinders player that come from small tounament scenes as they go into a qualifying tournament. It also suggest some rather controversial ways we as members of Team DeckTech can network together to overcome this phenomenom as well as any of our competition. I hope many of you are prepared to go to worlds this year, I think it will be fun.<br>
<br>
_____Also thier were a few submissions that I couldn&#146;t fit into this issue that will go out in the next one. Most notably are articles by Jon VanDeerMeer and the MWYHL deck refferenced in Davids article on defensive strategy. Keep those quality articles coming. Now on with the administrative stuff.<br>
