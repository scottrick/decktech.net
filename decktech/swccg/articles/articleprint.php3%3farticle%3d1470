I disagree.  For both sides, much of the game is going to be spent battling to keep out your Admiral's Order.  Because of the ability to pull an AO, it is obvious that both sides are going to be packing Admiral Pietts and Ackbars.  However, the real question is how are you going to keep your Admiral's Order out when you know that his AO could crush your strategy?<br>
One obvious answer is to wait until your opponent deploys his Admiral's Order to take out yours.  Another obvious one is to pack multiple copies of yours.  But there are a couple of interrupts and effects that can help out the Light Side in keeping theirs out.  One of my favorite cards, Tunnel Vision, is a great way to do this, plus its got other uses if you don't need it.  Another one, less plausible as I see it, is Demotion.  If your opponent happens to already have his Admiral's Order out, or if he waits until the beginning of the next turn after he deploys Piett to use his game text(that way he knows it will be in there), you can pop Demotion on Piett to keep him from getting it.  As lots of LS decks are packing multiple copies of The Signal, that shouldn't be too hard.  Another thing that I think almost all players will do, (not that they should or need to)is play with strategies that WON't be destroyed by your Admirals Order being replaced.<br>
<br>
Dark Side space strategies: TIEs.<br>
I can foresee people playing with TIE interceptors and weapons decks, which definitely has potential, but the one strategy that really struck out to me is actually an old one.  With the new effect Combat Response, Tallon Roll decks are plausible and promising.  Packing one of every unique starfighter and their pilots, plus Dreadnaughts will give you a formidable space force that won't be negatively effected by any of the Admirals Orders, plus your opponent will be hurting if hes using non-unique starfighters because of the one that makes starfighters without pilots power -2.	This makes Tallon Rolling even easier, plus the appeal of a Used Interrupt that can eliminate a starfighter w/ little to no effort.  Luke Skywalker on Artoo in Red 5? Not a problem, drop a dreadnaught, OS-72-10 on Obsidian 10, battle, all Power to Weapons, and a Tallon Roll and even a low destiny will get rid of him.	I don't foresee people playing all capital starship decks, but Lateral Damage would definitely put the hurt on Home One.  Also, with most of the unique TIE/lns being maneuver 5 or 6 w/ their matching pilot, Watch Your Back is another great interrupt for the dark side.<br>
<br>
Devious Light Side tech tip:<br>
I am not sure about this, but I think that Commence Recharging can deploy on the Superlaser Mark II, since it says deploy on A superlaser, not deploy on Superlaser.  But if it can, since the Superlase Mark II will never blow up planets, it is a great way to make the opponent choose between practically losing 8 force and firing their superlaser.<br>
<br>
Light Side space strategy: Starfighters with Weapons<br>
The big cruisers for the LS are appealing, but I like the idea of using starfighters and weapons.  With the Light Side equivalent of Combat Response, you can get Red Squadron and their matching pilots out pretty fast.  But the card that makes this all worth it is (drum roll please) Slayn and Korpil facilities!!!! Yes, that's it the light side space Scum and Villainy, only better!  With X-wing laser cannons (I love these, if you use 3, they are automatically lost) on Red Squadron you can retrieve 4 or more every battle.  If you like to, you can pack a few Enhanced Proton Torpedoes to take out the Big Blue, Death star II.  The other thing that makes this all worth it is the kicking interrupts from Special Edition for the Light Side.  Slight Weapons Malfunction adds one battle destiny when you fire a weapon in a battle, no explanation needed.  Darklighter Spin makes the maneuver of one of your ships your destiny( its Space Smoke Screen, only its used and a common!)and of course, my favorite: Stay Sharp.  The first part of it is a Sniper for space, and the second part adds the destiny number of one of your weapons to your power total.  That's 5 for x-wing laser cannons and 7 for intruder missiles!	Also Concentrate all fire makes all your starships that fire weapons power + 3.  Oh yeah, not like I need to mention it, but Organized Attack makes your X-wings and Y-wings power +1 and immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:  Don't be caught up in the hype about the new objectives, they are very good, but there is a lot of space stuff in Death Star 2 that really makes it a great set and makes for some awesome strategies even though I have only mentioned two here. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
