<br>
     Star Wars CCG is a complex game. It encompasses a lot more than just what meets the eye. Though the cards themselves are a big part of it, they don&#146;t play by themselves. Knowledge of the game is needed to play, to know the various individual elements of the game. Skill is needed, to render this knowledge into a strategy, a gameplan, and is required if you are to have any success at all. Luck isn&#146;t necessarily needed, nor does it necessarily play a factor in some games, but it can play a part in ascertaining your goal, whether that&#146;s winning a single game, or the World Championships. Then there&#146;s your conduct, which determines your individuality, and consists of your attitude and habits. Last but not least, your focus, which has a subtle yet powerful impact. Let&#146;s try going through each of these ideas one by one.<br>
<br>
Knowledge<br>
<br>
-Logic<br>
<br>
     There are some things you can&#146;t help but know. Forgetting to Force drain is a bad thing. We all know that. But what you may not know is that one person&#146;s logic can greatly differ from another person&#146;s. You may have certain habits that you don&#146;t know about, certain behaviors that you can&#146;t help but do because it seems logical to you. It&#146;s almost an instinct. Identifying these behaviors can be key, just because not only will it give you a better understanding of your style, but changing that behavior, tweaking it, can give you another tool for victory.<br>
<br>
-Rules<br>
<br>
     Knowing the basic rules is one thing. Knowing them all is another, but can anyone really know them all? Situations arise in which there is no given answer, and we need a ruling. It&#146;s important to know, though. You can become a better player simply by increasing your knowledge of the rules. A lack of knowledge can be devastating. You might be assuming you can do something, maybe a killer combo, but unbeknownst to you, it&#146;s illegal.<br>
<br>
     Like Tzizzvt and I Thought They Smelled Bad On The Outside. The Interrupt is Used, destiny 7, non-unique, and doubles Tzizzvt&#146;s power. Let&#146;s go through each stage of increasing knowledge. At first, you think you can only double Tzizzvt&#146;s power once with the Interrupt, because of that cumulative rule you know about. Then, you learn that the cumulative rule doesn&#146;t apply to separate actions and resolutions (you learn that this is why separate Snivvians can retrieve lots of Force when the opponent cancels Nightfall... even though they&#146;re all Snivvians, each one&#146;s text is resolved separately, not falling under the cumulative rule, and thus you can retrieve more than just 2 Force) so you think you can double Tzizzvt&#146;s power several times. You figure, by using the Interrupt multiple times, you can double Tzizzvt&#146;s power to 4, then 8, then 16, then 32, then 64, then 128. All you have to do is deploy Tzizzt, use the Interrupt a few times, battle, and you win the game. So you play a game with your friend, and you try your new strategy. But your friend tells you that you can&#146;t, and that because the Interrupts, while separate, are modifying the same value (Tzizzvt&#146;s power), the cumulative rule does apply. The Snivvians work because they&#146;re each resolving a separate value. So you&#146;re back to where you started.<br>
<br>
     Notice that your first instinct and your final knowledge were the same. That&#146;s why it&#146;s dangerous to be in the middle, you can make big mistakes. A lot of times it&#146;s just better to trust your instincts. If your opponent does something that he claims is legal, but seems a little fishy, don&#146;t be afraid to challenge his ruling.<br>
<br>
Skill<br>
<br>
-Concept<br>
<br>
     Supposedly, some are born great, some acquire greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. In reality, anybody can be great. It may take some hard work, skill, maybe some luck, but you can do it. Never think that your opponent is any better than you are. More on this later. Everybody has the potential for greatness, but not many people achieve their full potential. Skill is something you have to get. You can&#146;t just have it. Whether you attain it by learning, working at it, or some other means is up to you. While there are plenty of different skill levels, you never have to stop getting better, never have to stop trying to attain a higher skill level.<br>
<br>
-Strategy<br>
<br>
     Strategy has to do with what the cards can do. This is fairly obvious, but it&#146;s good to know in comparison with the intangibles of skill. Strategy is one thing that you don&#146;t need to learn by yourself. There&#146;s plenty or great strategies out there, that plenty of people use. You can simply choose which strategy you want, and use it. Convenient. But there are a couple things wrong with doing this so simply. For one, this strategy may not be for you, may not be your style. More on this later. Or, your skill level may be too low for this strategy. Even if a certain deck does well, that doesn&#146;t mean you&#146;ll be good with it. Another thing is, it isn&#146;t always a matter of just choosing a strategy and going with it. You may have to combine it with other strategies. Or maybe this strategy has several versions, and you&#146;ll have to choose which way you&#146;ll attempt this strategy. Or maybe you want to do it your own way. Whatever the case, strategy is hardly ever simple. It&#146;s something that changes a lot, can be good one day and bad the next, can be only good against certain other strategies. There isn&#146;t on all-mighty strategy that&#146;s guaranteed to win. Which is an extremely good thing. Just take a strategy that you like, and play. Every strategy will do badly once in a while, and if it isn&#146;t bad now, it might be bad later. New cards, rulings, errata, etc. Strategy is something you have to find on your own, and adjust it once in a while, on your own. I can&#146;t help you with it.<br>
<br>
-Intangibles<br>
<br>
     Intangibles are what you do with the cards. Whether the cards say they&#146;re capable of it or not. A beginner may have to read every card to see what it does. An intermediate player may pride himself on knowing what a card does, but that&#146;s all he does with the card, what it says it can do. An expert however, does things with a card that are never mentioned on the card. I&#146;m not an expert, I&#146;m still a beginner in many ways, so I can&#146;t use cards to their fullest, just because I tend to assume that they can only do so much.<br>
<br>
     Planning. Not only is a strategy better when you plan it out as much as you can, but it&#146;s also good to plan in advance. Expert players can analyze the current situation, see each choice, each possible outcome resulting from each choice, and then that player can plan accordingly. It&#146;s also good to have a backup plan. Whether it&#146;s bad luck or judgement, your plan can go wrong. So it&#146;s always a good idea try to have a backup plan. And one thing that makes planning ahead easier is...<br>
<br>
     Tracking. Not everybody can do it, and some of those who can use don&#146;t use it as well as they could. There are some really good articles on this, so I won&#146;t go into it too much. But I will say that tracking destinies can be really beneficial. And can even contribute to your...<br>
<br>
     Originality. Using cards for a completely different reason than they were intended. Like using Throw Me Another Charge just to see what&#146;s in your Reserve deck, and therefore finding out what&#146;s in your Force pile. Using You Will Take Me To Jabba Now for it&#146;s first function. Or deploying 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle as a passenger on Zuckuss In Mist Hunter to add a battle destiny. Some people don&#146;t even know that you can do this. So it comes as a...<br>
<br>
     Surprise. A skilled player can surprise his opponent a lot. Reacts, Interrupts, a lot of things can be surprising. The very way you play, your very conduct, all can give you a mental edge over the opponent. A surprise can possibly disrupt their strategy, make your opponent forget something, or anything else. This is another reason to be original. Surprise can be a very powerful ally, or an undesirable hindrance.<br>
<br>
Luck<br>
<br>
-Consequence<br>
<br>
     Luck is something that we all may not agree on, but what I do know about it is that some things happen (sometimes with a certain indescribable consistency) with no explanation. Occasionally there&#146;s nothing to blame and we call it luck. Luck isn&#146;t something you can touch, see, or interact with. It&#146;s just what we pretend is responsible for stuff that happens.<br>
<br>
     While there may not be such thing as luck, there are things, while unexplainable, that can have a big effect on a single game, tournament, or career. Expansion packs for instance. You have no idea what&#146;ll be inside. With luck, you might get a really good card or 2, or maybe you won&#146;t get anything remotely worthwhile. Destiny draws are another thing. They&#146;re a big part of the game, but without tracking or rigging of any kind, you just have to hope for the best. A destiny can turn the tide of a game, whether it&#146;s in your favor or not is what you worry about. And those things we have no hand in, like pairings, or our vehicle breaking down. We just have to live with it, and hope our luck will be different next time. Or maybe it&#146;s a good thing, like someone else&#146;s vehicle breaking down, or who knows what. Whatever the case may be, one thing remains the same. No matter what your skill level, stuff can happen that you have no control over and can potentially change your position dramatically.<br>
<br>
Conduct<br>
<br>
-Individuality<br>
<br>
     Everybody&#146;s different. There&#146;s nothing you can do about it. You shouldn&#146;t try to blend in with everyone else, because you can&#146;t. You&#146;re different. If everybody around you is playing a certain kind of deck, that doesn&#146;t mean that you have to. In fact, it&#146;d be a good thing not just because it&#146;s different but because it&#146;d come as a surprise to other people. The differences themselves need to be identified. Some people are more defensive, while others are more aggressive. Some people are interactive, some are non-interactive. Some people can win with a certain strategy, others can&#146;t. Some people may like a certain strategy, others won&#146;t. If you&#146;re defensive, don&#146;t play with an aggressive deck. If you&#146;re interactive, don&#146;t play with a non-interactive deck. You may see other people doing well with it, but you can&#146;t do well with it no matter how much you try, because it isn&#146;t for you. Go with your instincts, play the deck that comes naturally to you. Once you find your style, stick with it, and never give up. With work, it can be just as good as any other.<br>
<br>
-Attitude<br>
<br>
     A negative attitude is never a good thing. If you&#146;re up against a much higher-ranking player, that doesn&#146;t mean you should immediately give up, or think that you can&#146;t win. That player isn&#146;t any better than you. He&#146;s probably just been playing longer, or spends more money on the game, or something like that. But your cards can beat his, if you play right, don&#146;t give up, have fun, and have a positive attitude. Your attitude affects how you play, trust me. If you think your opponent is invincible, you may not try something because you&#146;re afraid it&#146;ll backfire. You&#146;ll play a lot differently against someone you think is invincible than you will against a scrub. Then again, sometimes you&#146;ll be playing someone you think you&#146;re much better than, and you&#146;ll lose. Always be confident but not @#$%y.<br>
<br>
-Habits<br>
<br>
     Some things you can&#146;t help but do. Hopefully your habits are good, with maybe one or two bad habits. But knowing your habits helps a lot. Maybe you have a bad habit that keeps you from winning, but you don&#146;t know about it. Identifying it, and acting on it, can help a lot. But adjusting your habits is different from adjusting your strategy. A bad habit can be hard to break. Try to develop good habits, whatever they are. Make it a habit to remember things, check things, always thinking, challenging, planning, etc. Eventually it&#146;ll come naturally.<br>
<br>
Focus<br>
<br>
-Diligence and Reaction<br>
<br>
     Let&#146;s say you&#146;re an aggressive person, with an aggressive deck that&#146;s interactive. No matter what deck your facing, stick with your strategy, always being aggressive. If their deck is non-interactive and yours is, don&#146;t let that player  trick you into playing non-interactively. Don&#146;t play their style, stay with yours. It may be hard, and they might do what they can to prevent it, but to win you need to play the way that comes naturally to you and to the deck you play. Focus on what you want to do, what you need to do to win. And no matter what they do, focus on that. Don&#146;t let your opponent break your focus.<br>
<br>
     If you&#146;re focusing on a goal, then you need to achieve it. If your opponent knows or figures out this goal, he may try to do something about it. He could try to block you from it, in which case you need to get through that block. If he&#146;s blocking you than he&#146;s doing it because he knows if you achieve your goal he&#146;ll be in more trouble than he would be if he didn&#146;t devote resources to blocking you. Do whatever&#146;s necessary to get through that block. Don&#146;t get discouraged just because of that block. Or your opponent might try to distract you. Maybe he&#146;ll set up a diversion. It might be a lone scrub waiting to be slaughtered mercilessly. But that player might also be holding a Ghhhk in his hand, or maybe be planning a bunch of reacts. Be cautious. But you don&#146;t necessarily need to deal with that distraction. That&#146;s why it&#146;s a distraction; he&#146;s trying to distract you from your goal. No matter what, aim for your goal. The distraction may do a little damage, but usually it&#146;ll be less damage to you than what you&#146;ll do to him when you reach that goal. Always focus. He might try some other tactic, who knows what... but be careful how you react to it.<br>
<br>
     If you&#146;re playing an especially skilled player, not only will he probably have a backup plan, but he&#146;ll be prepared for anything you try to do to him, more reason to focus on what you&#146;re doing, not him. Now on the other hand, if you want to be aggressive, then by all means do so. Again, he may try to trap you into playing his type of game, non-interactive, defensive, passive. But you need to disrupt his strategy. Then again, it gets interesting when it&#146;s inter-active vs. interactive or defensive vs. defensive. Then you can make your own call. But the primary focus should be on yourself.<br>
<br>
     In closing, I&#146;d just like to say that the most important thing is to have fun. The game&#146;s not worth playing if you&#146;re not having fun playing it. Have fun,<br>
<br>
