I’ll get it out of the way and start with a little rant. And without further interruption, the rant. Don’t piss and moan that Decipher is losing the license! It could be a good thing for the franchise. WOTC is the obvious heir apparent and here are a few reasons why.<br>
<br>
1. WOTC was purchased a few years back by Hasbro Toys LLC who already owns the right to all the franchise toys and action figures.<br>
2. Wizards has a solid background of support for their products. As well as a regular release schedule that I’ve not seen them break. When they say something is coming out it does.<br>
3. Lucas Film has continued to have problems receiving royalties from Decipher due to late development and delayed release dates. The now infamous Jedi Knights card game is a prime example of big D screwing the pooch.<br>
4. Since the RPG has been given to WOTC and not Decipher that would further cement that Lucas is trying to consolidate his holdings into one companies hands. That means the CCG is more than likely already in development at WOTC with the episode II cards already being play tested.<br>
5. If you think I’m wrong just wait 6 months and you’ll see how wrong you were.<br>
<br>
Okay now that I’ve finally gotten that crap off of my chest back to the cards.<br>
<br>
I’d like to look at some of my favorite deck types and how they will be affected by the new set.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down- Wow. This deck is going to get quite a few big boosts from this set. Darth Sidious is the obvious nod here to start with. If he’s off alone somewhere he gets to put Jedi out of play for the very reasonable cost a 1 lost force. He has Trade federation in his lore which makes him playable in the new Invasion objective. On Coruscant he can use 1 to add destiny to a neimoidian in battle somewhere. All this and the regular cool stuff associated with a dark jedi master on the table make this addition huge. A lot of the new droids will start making an appearance in Hunt Down. Their built to wreck Jedi for crying out loud. Top it off with Guri, TC-14, and a few other Destroyers and the jedi will run away instead of risking their necks in a fight.<br>
<br>
Jabba’ Palace- This gets very few helpers from the new set. Some of the best current options will look something like this:<br>
<br>
Maul’s Hutt<br>
Combat readiness<br>
Jabba’ Palace<br>
Twi’Lek Advisor X4<br>
Where Are Those Droidekas?!<br>
Rolling, Rolling, Rolling. X4<br>
EV-99 X3<br>
Droid workshop<br>
Destroyer Droid X10<br>
Darth Maul X4<br>
<br>
Basically, Maul On The Rocks droid drain style. Trust me this could be foul to have to play against. Other than taking advantage of droids I don’t see how Jabba decks are going to fair in the current environment.<br>
<br>
Dark Deal got no real help this set either. Nor did ISB, Agents Of Black Sun, Carbon Chamber Testing, SYCFA/TIES, Endor or any other of some of the most popular decks. Well that is all except for…<br>
<br>
Bring Him Before Me- Having already benefited from the likes of R3.(Stormtrooper Garrison and Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter) The dark side now has Darth Sidious to throw in the throne room with the Emperor. Two dark Jedi masters is sick enough to make most players steer clear of the Throne Room for the duration of the game. Heck deploy Ephant Mon with them and watch the light side do nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Let Them Make The First Move- This deck gets Darth Sidious as well as all the droids you can shake a stick at. Finally a cheap beat squad to drop so you can defend a site much more effectively. Plus with the droid racks on the table you get to pull the same suicide tactics the light sides has been using with EPP’s since the Bacta Tank and A Jedi’s Resilience came into play. <br>
Echo Base- no real help here. It did get a little boost from reflections 3 though.<br>
<br>
Rescue the Princess- Received some really nice enhancements from Theed. The Naboo guards being some of the nicest and most helpful cards for this deck since EPPs came out. A nice hybrid would be a few copies of Padme and Prisoner 2187 along with all the EPPs you could shake a stick at.<br>
Your guaranteed to draw at least three destinies each battle. That and the flip side of the objective kill Imperials and dark Jedi decks. All in all this deck is looking better than it has in years.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base- No help here, unless you want the non-flip hidden mains Naboo celebration deck type. Other than that no new twists.<br>
<br>
Local Uprising- here’s a very good way to get all those N-1 star fighters and non-unique Gungans working hard for you. All the new Gungan cards make their little army a truly nasty site to behold. Top it off with squadron assignments and the N-1’s and you take land and space with no problem.<br>
Of course this is a deck with weaknesses right? Not as many as you might think. The new Gungan helpers make you next to unstoppable with the Gungan army. Look into it, you might just be surprised.<br>
<br>
We Have A Plan- The new light side objective is not something that I’m too sure of yet. It has some very dramatic benefits, but I’m still not sure that its worth playing outside of the closed environment yet. It does look to be strong though.<br>
<br>
None of the other deck types have gotten any kind of boost in a while. Some of the new cards tend to be a little more powerful than cards of the past expansions as well. For this being Deciphers last product I have to say that they did a pretty good job. None of the cards have had to have had errata due to a severely unbalanced play mechanic. All in all this is a job well done by big D. Good finish folks, and nice run on a good product. <br>
