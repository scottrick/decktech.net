Are there any uses for these cards, you ask. Well, most of them you can keep right were they are but there are a few often overlooked by the average player. Here are the ones I found.<br>
<br>
Put that Down (Cloud City LS)<br>
Destiny 4, used interrupt<br>
Text: If one of your characters was just targeted by a weapon during a battle use 3 force to cancel that targeting OR cancel double back or Res Luk Ra*auf<br>
<br>
NOTE: for those of you who can not find the words &quot;by a weapon&quot; on your copy that*s because it isn*t there, there was an errata. This card seems self-explanatory. Tired of having your Jedi chopped by Maul YA? Then don*t even give him the chance to draw his saber. Pesky bounty weapons got you down? Not anymore, just be careful not to try to cancel bossk w/ gun because that doesn*t target a specific character. The second part of this card is basically crap but the first part could save your butt a number of times, it is also a descent destiny, recyclable interrupt.<br>
<br>
Somersault (Cloud City LS)<br>
Destiny 3 lost interrupt<br>
Text: During a battle at a site, just before drawing BD, if opponent has less than double your total power, use 4 force to switch numbers. OR If both players just drew one battle destiny, use 1 force to switch numbers.<br>
<br>
The text is kind of confusing so let me give an example, you have power 20 opponent has power 39 (which is less than double yours [40]) use 4 force to make your power 39 and his 20. That is just plain awesome. They are about to smack you down royally and boom whose beating whom now? The second part is also very handy if they have more than double you power. Say you draw a 1 (stupid Qui-Gon had to be in your reserve deck not at the battle) and they draw a six. You only have to forfeit 1 and they have to forfeit 6! a big turn around.<br>
<br>
Oh, Switch Off (Hoth DS)<br>
Destiny 6 used interrupt<br>
Text: cancel any attempt to target your droid to be stolen, hit or lost. Droid is protected from all such attempts for remainder of turn. OR switch off any binary droid for remainder of turn.<br>
<br>
What are good cards, need to be protected, everyone use them and happen to be droids? Destroier Droids, all LS players want them dead but with this handy Destiny 6 used interrupt they will have no luck what so ever. Keep P-59 on table for another turn so you can stack up there and protect him. The second part is stupid though but hey who cares with a first part so pimp!<br>
<br>
A Bright Center To the Universe (Special Edition DS)<br>
Destiny 4 effect<br>
Text: Deploy on death star system or Coruscant system. Target another system. At locations related to target system, opponent force drain modifiers are canceled. Effect canceled if opponent controls this system (immune to alter).<br>
<br>
Not as powerful as its LS counterpart (which I will talk about next) but still a good card. If you are playing a space deck you need this card, not only will it help you in the impending drain race but it is nearly impossible for the opponent to cancel it! They get no drain modifiers and you get space to force drain them to death! Very much worth it for 1 card, don*t you think?<br>
<br>
The Planet That Is Farthest From (Special Edition LS)<br>
Destiny 4 Effect<br>
Text: Deploy on Tatooine or Dagobah system. Target another system. At locations related to target system, opponents force drain modifiers are canceled. Effect canceled if opponent controls this system. (Immune to alter.)<br>
<br>
Similar to its DS counterpart but can be should be even placed in a popular deck type, Hidden base. Rape the crap out of pesky TDIGWATT and any Tatooine drain deck, a must for anyone with a powerful space deck.<br>
<br>
It*s Not My Fault (Special Edition LS)<br>
Destiny 5 used interrupt<br>
Text: If opponent just initiated a battle at a site, use X force to make your character present immune to attrition for remainder of battle where X= that characters ability (free if Han or Lando).<br>
<br>
This is the best out of all the cards in this article, if you are playing profit and opponent initiates against Han and others play this card and Han is immune to attrition! If you have a stack-up and all your characters are immune except Chewie, it only takes 2 force and this handy used interrupt.  The fact that mains with aren*t immune to attrition is no longer an issue, Leia w/ is immune for the use of only 4 force! I could not believe the sheer power of this card when I read it, a must in any deck.<br>
<br>
Sacrifice (Special Edition DS)<br>
Destiny 4 used interrupt<br>
Text: Reduce you battle damage by 5 by losing from hand a starship, vehicle or character. OR if your characters forfeit was just reduced to zero, restore it to normal (immune to sense).<br>
<br>
This is an awesome card in any deck. If you have to forfeit all your guys because they all have low forfeit this card will save the day, just lose the space protection you have in your hand if they don*t have a space deck. The second part is also handy, your guy hit with a lightsaber will still have to be lost mine as well be able to add his forfeit so you can keep guys at the site. Scenario, Boba w/, Vader w/ and Maul are in a battle, Opponent chops Maul and you play this card he get his forfeit 9 so you don*t have to lose Vader or Boba Very nice, very nice indeed.<br>
<br>
First Aid (Special Edition LS)<br>
Destiny 4 Used interrupts<br>
Text: If your characters forfeit was just reduced to zero, restore it to normal. OR reduce your battle damage by 5 by losing from hand a starship, vehicle, or character. (Immune to sense)<br>
<br>
I don*t know if you notice but the DS counterpart to this card, Sacrifice, is worded exactly backwards with the reduction by 5 part first and restore forfeit last. No big deal except for one minor detail, the immunity to sense at the end of both cards.  I pretty sure that the immunity to sense only applies to the wording after the word OR not the whole card which can be bad. For DS you can restore forfeit without having to worry about sense, it is the opposite for LS. Big difference but again I*m not sure if the immunity to sense applies to the whole card, if it does then the cards are exact same just backwards. Since they are the same the strat is the same as above, just replace Boba w/, Vader w/ &amp; Maul with Leia w/, Luke w/ &amp; Qui-Gon, you get the basic idea though.<br>
<br>
Double Agent (A New Hope LS)<br>
Destiny 6 lost interrupt<br>
Text: If both players have a spy at same site draw destiny. Add 2 if opponents spy is undercover. Opponent*s spy lost if destiny greater than 2. OR opponent*s Toonika Sisters present at a site cross to your side. <br>
<br>
I now a lot of people know about this card and it isn*t a crap card I just mentioned it because this card is pimp and can be explained in just one word Mara. Yep good old Emperor*s right hand lady is a spy and so is Corran Horn and Lando w/ vibro ax, if you are playing Profit or any deck with Corran you need this card to kill Mara. Think of it, right before battle you take out Mara making the opponent minus 1 saber and 4 power (6 if Emperor on table), and, on top of all that, the card is destiny 6. <br>
<br>
I hope this article will help you in your future deck making and give you a new light on those crap cards that aren*t really crap. Note: if you realize the card on your dartboard is needed for a deck get a new copy of that card, not many players appreciate playing against two beat up halves of a card held together by duct tape, it*s just not good player etiquette. Thank you for reading and please rate fairly.   <br>
