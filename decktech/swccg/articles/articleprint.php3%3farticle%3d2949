For Intended Release on Decktech.net and at FreedomCon on 11/17/01.<br>

A Tribute to anything must first begin with a message overall summarizing the aspect and what you are referring to was like or is like and sometimes what it will continue to be. This article isn&#146;t about gameplay, it&#146;s not about how to make a deck so strong you can win on your first turn, it&#146;s a Tribute to the Star Wars: Customizable Card Game and what it is now, what it was like and what it will continue to be, as long as we continue to be fascinated by the galaxy far, far away…<br>
<br>
	The Star Wars Customizable Card Game began with an idea developed by a person either at Decipher or at Lucasfilm, Ltd. A card game based on a movie series in which players face of each other in the basis the movie went on. The Good versus the Evil, The Dark Side versus the Light Side. This idea was accepted and in 1995 the pilot set, Premiere, with it&#146;s 326 cards, came out. The Bold Black packs and Starter Boxes were slowly bought. At some point, 2-player game packs came out with pre-made decks, not like to Starter Boxes, with Randomly assorted cards. People began to hook on to the game. (Though I didn&#146;t like Star Wars until Special Edition came out and my classmates told me about it and I watched the movies.) But why were we buying these pieces of cardboard priced by a company that had nothing to do with the game at around 25 cents per card to 60 dollars per card? Was it because we were tricked by some psychological commercial and be &quot;zombie-a-fied&quot; into getting these cards? Was it because we were infatuated by the movies, which have awed many with cutting edge graphics at least for their time, and the wonderful plot and character collection? Definitely. This set had the basis for the CCG&#146;s playing field, locations for people to walk around on, characters like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The weapons and devices to enhance character and starship usage, vehicles to transport characters around, and interrupts and effect to make the game have twists at every turn.<br>
	<br>
	When Premiere began to be the old set, Decipher released their next set in 1996, in a shiny purple wrapper, A New Hope. This set, smaller than the original, added some new cards into play for the CCG, The Death Star and the Epic Events surrounding its complexity. The Epic Event for the Light Side, Attack Run, added the idea of playing a space-based deck and the Dark Side to defend the Death Star. The Dark Side Epic Event, Commence Primary Ignition, which allowed players to attempt to blow up planets, and reenact the fun idea of blowing up planets in their &quot;small moon.&quot; With this set, came the characters that were not printed in the Premiere, like Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and such. These additional cards that came from the A New Hope set and the demand for the cards caused Decipher to bring out a new set based on the next movie.<br>
<br>
	A New Hope saw it&#146;s fame and then a new set followed up, in a sleek white package. The 2-player pre-made starter decks and white packs with 11 cards in it hit the stands, creating the set entitled what it was based on, Hoth. This was in 1998 as well, like A New Hope. These few packs started the SW:CCG and it&#146;s dynasty of packs with many different colors and cards. Hoth, started the collection of Empire Strikes Back packs, which weren&#146;t exactly as good as some players say, due to their lack of many good rare cards, and their abundance of &quot;junky&quot; cards. Yet, they all do have some of the best and most sought after cards in them. Hoth brought forward the ideas of frostbite and many conditions humans suffer in the winter and atop mountains. The second Dark Side Epic Event came out, Target The Main generator, which didn&#146;t see much play later on, due to the fact that the Light Side had to deploy the Main Power Generators. Dark Side also got its first AT-St and AT-AT. These were accompanied by the idea in which every pack should include 2 -3 Star Destroyers, which Hoth had 2. The Light Side benefited too, Commander Luke Skywalker came out, and his band of Rogue Squadron, set to defend the base at all costs. Light Side also received Luke&#146;s first usable lightsaber, Anakin&#146;s Lightsaber, which is also compatible with Leia, in which it can deploy on any Skywalker.<br>
<br>
	(Somewhere between these two debuted the Jedi Pack, which contained the newbie&#146;s version of Motti, Tarkin, Han, and Leia, all 2,2 and were somewhat bad cards. This time also showed the Gold Leader in Gold 1 card and the Red Leader in Red 1 card.)<br>
<br>
	When Hoth lost some of its lust Decipher printed Dagobah in 1998 with its earth green wrapper, which became to some, &quot;Decipher&#146;s worst set.&quot; A lot of the cards in Dagobah were useless and the planet itself was badly designed enough. Yet, out of this bad set came some of the best cards and most sought out, bounty hunters like Bossk, Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and Dengar, which composed the settings for many deck designs in the future. The Dark Side also got it&#146;s best starship yet, Executor, the Super-Star Destroyer. The Light Side got a new type of card, Jedi Training capable of training a character and gaining some awesome effects, this idea would not take off much until later. The Light Side got it&#146;s first Jedi Master, they did, the Master of Jedi he is, Yoda. The Light Side got its third persona of Luke, Son of Skywalker, the ideal apprentice for training decks in the CCG to most. The set wasn&#146;t too bad, yet it contained the most useless rares than any other set.<br>
<br>
	To try to pull some players who quit back into the game, Decipher printed the First Anthology, a set that was based on six cards that would soon come from Special Edition set, and was the first of Three Anthologies creating an anthology dynasty. The set contained Commander Wedge Antilles, Boba Fett and The Death Star Assault Squadron. This set contained some Premiere packs as well with the cards, creating a long rectangular box that most people use as common and uncommon storage cases. (This was the set in which I got my Darth Vader in a Premiere pack)<br>
	<br>
	Decipher then printed their final Empire Strikes Back set, the red packaged Cloud City. Cloud City debuted Lando Calrissan and the long awaited Boba Fett with his ship Slave 1. Cloud City was the set that contained Boba Fett&#146;s Blaster Rifle and Captain Han Solo and other items such as Carbon Freezing Cards and Bounty Hunting Cards with posed a new gameplaying strategy. Light Side got it&#146; first non 3,3 Leia, a 3,4 Leia that was a pilot and added 1 to the power of starship she pilots. This set was another set that contains some &quot;junky&quot; rares but more people buy Cloud City then they would Dagobah. The set was somewhat popular because at the time, it was the only set with a Vader dueling card, the Epic Event, Epic Duel.<br>
<br>
	Jabba&#146;s Palace followed Cloud City, a gold-yellowish wrapper. This set contains the scum and villainy of the SW:CCG, from Jabba the Hutt to Bib Fortuna, to every character you could probably name in the Return of the Jedi movie. The Light Side was not empty-handed. The got Princess Leia Organa in her metal bikini, Artoo, and many helping cards, most of Jabba&#146;s Palace cannot really be explained in a few cards that came out, the cards dealt with assisting many deck types, mainly Tatooine gameplay. This set also introduced starting interrupts, like Twiliek Advisor and The Signal, which both let you pull an effect in the beginning of the game and deploy it on table.<br>
<br>
	Following Jabba&#146;s Palace was another Anthology and a Sealed Deck set, both totaling to 24 new cards, the Sealed Deck with some named cards like Dreadnauts and Z-95 Headhunters. The Second Anthology contained preview cards from Endor and Death Star II, which would come later. Some of the cards were Flagship Operations and Mon Mothma. But whereas these were the cards that showed what would be in future sets, nothing delivered that idea than the release of Special Edition.<br>
<br>
	Special Edition changed the way Star Wars card would be played more than any other set. With the release of the double-sided Objectives, Star wars gameplay soon began to develop the gameplay most people use today, the objective with starting interrupts. Special Edition&#146;s Objectives were: Rescue the Princess, Hidden Base, Dantooine Base Operations, Carbon Chamber Testing, Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi, Imperial Occupation, ISB Operations, Raltiir Operations, Mind What You Have Learned, and Local Uprising. Special Edition gave us new personas of almost everybody, Ben Kenobi, Darth Vader: The Dark Lord of The Sith, Princess Leia, and much more.<br>
<br>
	The next set changed gameplay as well, with characters having permanent weapons, the Enchanced Premiere pack, containing, Luke with Lightsaber, Ob-Wan with Lightsaber, Han with Heavy Blaster Pistol, Leia with Blaster Rifle, Boba Fett with Blaster Rifle, and Darth Vader with Lightsaber. These ideas took off and were bought at a rapid rate.<br>
<br>
Next came the next volume of the SW:CCG, the Endor set, with it bluish-green hue wrapper, it contained Chewbacca of Kashyyyk, and his &#146;roar&#146; ability, General Solo, Daughter of Skywalker, Crix Madine, Mon Mothma, the six Tempest Scout Walkers, and the two Objectives, Rebel Strike Team and Endor Operations. Rebel Strike Team, a popular Objective, was just about as popular as Endor Operations, who is continue to see fame right now. RST was accompanied by the Epic Event, Deactivate the Shield Generator.<br>
<br>
	Next came the continuation of the Enchanced Packs Line, with the release of Enchanced Cloud City, which contained Chewie With Blaster Rifle, Lando With Blaster Pistol, Lando In Millennium Falcon, and the Objective Quiet Mining Colony. Dark Side also benefited from ECC. They got Boba Fett In Slave 1, Dengar In Punishing One, 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle, IG-88 With Riot Gun, and the Objective This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time. The mini expansion set came up later in a few weeks/months with the Enchanced Jabba&#146;s Palace. Containing cards like Boussh, the Mara Jade that&#146;s coming to Freedom Con 2001, Her Lightsaber, Master Luke, and many other cards that could surround Jabba&#146;s Palace, like the Objectives, You Can Either Profit by This… and Court of the Vile Gangster.<br>
<br>
	After these two sets, came Reflections, a set containing 114 cards that were the best of the CCG and were made shimmering backgrounds. This was after a handful of Endor cards had been made in the same fashion. This idea, which was also done in Magic, according to some of the people I spoke to. This is probably, according the most, due to the holographic foil cards made in the Pokemon card game. The next set that came after Reflections was the most recent Anthology, the Third Anthology, not containing preview cards, but the Premium cards Prisoner 2187, a Princess Leia card hoping to revive Rescue The Princess, and the Objective, Massassi Base Operations, based on blowing up the Death Star. Set Your Course For Alderaan, based on using the Death Star to blow up systems. The set was highly bought and is still used in many deck types.<br>
<br>
	The new set came out in 2000 and is probably one of the best sets in the CCG, Death Star II, but before I go into DSII&#146;s wonderful works, I don&#146;t mean to drive off subject, but there&#146;s a problem Decipher most recently took great action to save this set. When it came out, there&#146;s around I haven&#146;t bought one in a while, some 20-40 packs in a DSII box at every store. Of those 20-40, out of every 3 boxes or so, there was a glitch in the packaging system, which caused some packs to have 9 cards, giving the pack either above or below it 13 cards. Other packs would come with no rare, and usually the pack either above or below it would have either 2 rares, or perchance the rare in the no rare pack would just be a sorting misfire. When this was solved, (atleast as I have heard) this occurred around early this year and before then, players would send in to Decipher and receive replacement packs. Death Star II, containing some of the best cards ever, released the starting interrupts Prepared Defenses and Heading for the Medical Frigate, which both let you pull 3 effects for the beginning of the game. This card slowly began to replace The Signal, as it became a popular beginning card with Objectives. DSII also included the Objective the allow you to attempt to convert Vader to the Light Side or Luke to the Dark Side. The set also included Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, which is more powerful than his 3,4 card in Premiere. This set also include Flagship Executor though it is feeble compared to it&#146;s predecessor, who was immune to attrition &lt; 12, and the new persona was only immune to attrition if targeted by Flagship Operations, a DSII cards. The Dark Side received the cards Lord Vader, who was this time around 7,6 and Emperor Palpatine, the Dark Jedi Master, who was a 4,7 and could &quot;zap people&quot; with the DSII card, Force Lightning. The set also included the new card type, Admiral&#146;s Orders, a card that was like a big effect for space use and is still used in a lot of space design deck types.<br>
<br>
	After DSII came out, Decipher released Jabba&#146;s Palace Sealed Deck, which contained Mighty Jabba, the best Jabba persona until then, Lando with Vibro-Axe, which had errata around 1-5 weeks after it was printed with a misprint. The set also contained the Objectives Agents in The Court and My Kind Of Scum. These Objectives are no as popular as other objectives created in large expansion sets. The next set that came out was Reflections II: Expanding the Galaxy, which included many premium cards, like Prince Xizor, Vigaro, Grand Adimral Thrawn, the Objective Agents of Black Sun. The Light Side got their Objective, the highly popular and losing some of it&#146;s popularity, Watch Your Step. The Light Side got a Luke Skywalker: Rebel Scout, Dash Rendar, The Outrider, and many others, while the Dark Side got many other cards, like The Emperor.<br>
<br>
	After the Reflection II set, came the long awaited and dangerously awesome Tatooine set. This set was the set with the best chance of getting a main character or semi-main character. This set, mainly based on Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, contained some &quot;helper cards&quot; for other Non-Episode 1 Theme Decks. This set, contained no Objectives, and was made up of only 90 cards. Of these, was Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Naberrie, Jar Jar Binks, Sebulba, Watto, Obi-Wan Kenobi: Padawan Learner, and the ne idea that surrounds almost every type of Episode 1: Format II Games: Podracing. Podracing consists of (usually) a starting interrupt allowing that player to pull out a Podracer, the Epic Event Boonta Eve Podrace, the Podracing Arena, and different other stuff for each side, in which case, the Dark Side can pull out an effect, which is usually Watto&#146;s Box. If Light Side won the Podrace, it could use the Epic Event I Did It! Which gave even more of an incentive to play Podracing with the Light Side.<br>
<br>
	The next set, the most recent full size set was Coruscant, based on the planet it&#146;s named about. It was in this set that the first Episode 1 Objectives were debuted, No Money, No Parts, No Deal!; Plead My Case to The Senate; My Lord, Is That Legal?; and Hyperdrive Generator&#146;s Gone. This set contained the good main characters like Darth Maul, Young Apprentice; Senator Palpatine, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Nute Gunray and Rune Haako as well as Lott Dott as very popular senator for the Dark Side also made their appearances in Coruscant. The set was not as spiffed up as Tatooine was in terms of main characters grab chances, yet it still is a somewhat popular set.<br>
<br>
	The most recent and controversial set, Reflections III, debuted around 2-4 weeks before FreedomCon 2001, in which this article was written before. This set, which contains the most controversial part of the game, the upkeep. The upkeep says, when you deploy an awesome card from RIII, you must, at the end of your turn, use the amount of force after the star at the bottom of the card. Or you can place the card in your used pile and lose the amount of force after the arrow symbol, or place the character out of play. This effect is on a lot of the good new cards, like Stormtrooper Garrison, the new Boba Fett persona, and the Chewie: Enraged card. These effects on these cards are similar to that on most Magic cards, which a lot of Star Wars: CCG card players simply hate. The set, though has some goodness, the new Lightsaber Combat Objective lets you reenact the Epic Duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan, but allows you to use other Jedis, which some characters enjoy watching the 3 feet tall Yoda try to kill Darth Maul. Overall, the set, containing almost a new persona of everybody, has apparently claimed the playing lives of some of the CCG players.<br>
<br>
	The Star Wars: Customizable Card Game, has become a very popular card game, from its birth in 1995 to the current date, 11/13/01, and should continue to be a popular game. Alot of people quit when Special Edition cam out because of the Objectives, and that idea pulled in more players than losing players, and hopefully, the same situation will occur under the Reflections III Crisis. The Star Wars Customizable Card Game will live on, as will the joy and entertainment we enjoy about that galaxy far, far away….<br>
