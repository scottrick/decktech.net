<br>
    Having said that, if youre like me, youve heard a lot about a starwars pro tour in the last year.. The arguments for it have been in favor of increased competition, increased publicity (and thus more players and further incentive for decipher to continue making swccg) and better players (more incentive to be good)).. the arguments against it have been somewhat flimsy (pro tour would encourage cheating, bad sportsmanship, etc) and that the reason a pro tour should not take place is that it would somehow defile the sanctity of our supposedly 'pure' game which at present contains no bad sports, cheaters, etc... Now, this isnt an article on why we should have a pro tour, its an article on how to set one up.. So im not going to spend much time refuting the arguments against, except to say that the people that are cheating at swccg now, will be the same ones cheating trying to get into the pro tour, and they dont cheat becuase they win all the time (they cheat because they need every advantage they can to win) and given some training, and some good judges, the cheating could easily be kept to a minimum, and there are always methods for dealing with the cheaters themselves (banning, ejection, whatever).. essentially, cheat, but you better not get caught.. and for those of you who care about the sanctity of the game, in no way would you be strongarmed into participating in qualifiers, and we wouldnt be beating down your doors taking your jawa decks away from you ;)..<br>
<br>
    Ok, so we now want to set up a pro tour.. The main question is, where do we get the money?.. well, since we want the competition to be high level, were going to have to get a system of qualifiers anyway, so simply charge admission to them... So the first order of business would be setting up the system of qualifiers... heres a simple outline:<br>
<br>
assumptions<br>
1. that attendance for the qualifying events will be on average at least 35 people (which i think is pretty low)<br>
2. that there will be at least 4 retailers who will be willing to sell goods at the event<br>
3. that people can be found to run the event<br>
4. that a suitable room can be found for 500 dollars (not too incredibly huge)<br>
<br>
  Ok, so to outline the amount of money we need, well go through the costs of the event first. Well assume we need about 500 dollars (i checked into this and hotel lobbys, etc. go for about this amount for a reasonable day in advance, as well as college auditoriums, small convention centers, etc.). Secondly, ill allocate about 300 dollars to pay for personell (assuming about 6 people can run the qualifier with the tournament software, assuming 2 people to do pairings, 2 people to judge, and 2 people to do admissions at 50 dollars per person). Ill assume 300 dollars in cash prizes (for plane tickets to the next event.. best case scenario is some airline wants to be associated with starwars so we get the tickets for free or at a discount).. Prizes are for the top 2, the top 3-4 would qualify for each event depending on the location and the expected attendance.. the non-prize qualifiers would have to pay thier own way under this system if they wished to go.. And about 300 dollars for miscellaneous other expenditures (printing booklets, setting up banners, etc., getting small trophies for top 8).. So a qualifier would require about 1400 dollars to run, which isnt all that much.<br>
<br>
  Ok, so we need 1400 bucks.. how can we get it.. first off, weve assumed were gonna get 35 people (if we hold the Q's in good locations and put the word out, thats a VERY conservative estimate), and were going to need a fair amount of money, so for our sake, well charge $12.50 (obviously american) for admission (this could be lowered to something like 10 depending upon demand).. ok, so weve got 35 people paying 12.50 so were assuming a revenue of 437.50 from ticket sales. This isnt extravagant. And during the day, numberous side tournaments would be run that would be in some shortened format (like 8 person 4 gamers with 15 minute game time limits or something that cost 4 bucks, plus sealed decks and such) and assuming 4 of those at 8 people thats 128 dollars..  Also, if we charged 5 hobby stores $175 to sell their wares at our place (plus possibly a smaller fee for a smaller space) we can assume about 875 dollars revenue from that (and there are plenty of travelling hobby stores that go from convention to convention, so wed need only tap into that market a little). Also, since wed be printing a schedule of events for the day, we could sell advertising space in the schedule for between 20 and 50 dollars a pop (full page or half page or quarter page) and assuming we could cram maybe 25 advertisers (definitely a small sample) in there, thats about 400 more... (and we could get movie theaters, and all kinds of psuedo-related people to advertise as well for THAT cheap. one person patronizing a movie theater pays that back). So weve got 875 from retailers, 400 from advertisers, 437.50 from admissions (35), and 130 from tournaments which is a total of 1842 dollars assuming no outside support of any kind from any corporation 'donating' money..<br>
<br>
  So profit would be about 450 dollars per event given an attendance of 35.. which means that if we lowered the price by 7 bucks (to 5 dollars) and chaged our revenue from 437 to 175, wed still be making about 175 dollars profit on 35 people.. so that could also be done to 'put the butts in the seats'.. however, a charge of 8-10 dollars is likely a more prudent one, because it keeps the less serious out of the 'real' tournament, while theyre still allowed to participate in the side ones for less $$.. So given the original assumption, profit is @450 dollars per event.<br>
  To do an event like a pro tour, youd want a 'big' event feel, so 50-100 participants would be our target.. The top 25 in the world would be given automatic invites (as of a month before the tournament date) and the top rated player from the region it is held in would be given an auto-invite, as well as any player who won a PT in the past year. which would turn out to eventually be about 30 people or so.. and we have the top 3-4 qualifying from each event, so wed run about 20 of them at select locations (sometimes the same location, NY, LA, etc would get 2 or 3 each), so wed have about 60 participants from qualifiers, which leaves us with about 90 people in the tour to start with.. Then we would set up a pro tour point system where by participating in the tour you get a point, and placing top 12 you get additional points so that the top players would get auto-invites. The top 10 pro tour point holders would automatically get invited to the tour as well.. This would ensure that the highest level of competition be maintained within the system and that the best players in the world would be there.. So given 20 qualifiers at 450 dollars profit each, we have 9000 dollars profit from the qualifiers alone, given only 35 participants in each and AFTER the prizes have been given for the Q events.<br>
<br>
So lets assume we wanted to start by running 3 qualifiers, and then pay for the next set with the profits/monies from the first qualifier, and continue through that.. given that it costs 1400 dollars to set up, wed need about 4200 dollars to start up the series, and say 800 bucks in telephone, and other communications to make the whole setup work out.. so heres a simple series illustrating what i mean, starting with the dates of the first qualifiers, running through the last ones:<br>
      5000 startup<br>
5/10   800 after 3 qualifiers are set up<br>
5/11 +5526 monies from 3 qualifiers as outlined<br>
5/12  6326 total after 3 Q's<br>
5/18  2126 after 3 more qualifiers as outlined<br>
5/19 +5526 monies from 3 Q's<br>
5/20  7652 total after 6 Q's<br>
5/25  2252 after next 4 qualifiers are set up<br>
5/26 +7368 monies from 4 Q's<br>
5/27  9620 total after 10 Q's<br>
6/1   2620 after 5 Q's set up<br>
6/2  +9210 monies from 5 Q's<br>
6/3  11830 total after 15 Q's<br>
6/8    600 after 8 Q's set up<br>
6/9 +14736 monies from 8 Q's<br>
6/10 20736 total ater 23 qualifiers (46 participants)<br>
<br>
so there you go... 20 thousand dollars after 23 qualifiers based on relatively benign assumptions about attendance (even low assumptions)...<br>
if 9 more qualifiers were run (not hard to imagine) leaving 32 total qualifiers and 64 definite participants (as far as plane tickets go) the total amount of money raised would be $23,314, which is huge.. if we axe 5000 of that for the next set of qualifiers, we end up with 18,314 which is quite a hefty sum..<br>
  So weve outlined the necessary steps to constructing the qualifiers.. now what would a pro tour cost??.. Well, well assume a thousand dollars for space (we need more this time, and its gonna cost bank).. Well assume 2000 dollars for personell (20 people at 100 bucks)well assume 1000 dollars in peripheral costs (advertising, schedules, plaques, etc.).. So our event right now is costing us 4000 dollars.. So well add another thousand dollars worth of unforseen garbage just to make sure.. so our cost has skyrocketed to 5000 dollars to run our pro tour event.. (given no decipher employees, or whatever)..<br>
<br>
  Ok, well given the costs, lets outline our ways to make money.. Well, weve got about 19 thousand from the qualifiers, and we'll hold a TON of tournaments (YJ, Trek, All the decipher stuff as well as sealed decks, and the short events) and charge 3 dollars a tourney (were nice).. given that 35 people come (same as all the other ones :)) and they all play 2 events (not unlikely) then weve got about 115 dollars (which is pretty low, but bear with me).. also, since this crowd of 35 is watching our event (that isnt a spectator sport) well charge them 3 dollars admission as well (thats another 115 if anyones counting).. Also, since this event is drawing a bunch of people like the other ones, well charge dealers 250 dollars to sell their junk at our hall, and invite about 5 or 6 (which gives us another 1200 dollars)... Also, since were getting so many people, well sell advertising space in our pamphlets (again) for 50-100 dollars a pop, and given that we get 5 full pages, and 20 quarter page ads, weve got another 1500 bucks... so just by using the immediate stuff we have from the start, with NO funding from lucasfilm, NO funding from decipher, and NO corporate sponsorship, we arrive at the sum total generated by the pro tour as 19,744 dollars. And since weve already arranged for the 5000 to start the next cycle, it can all go to prize money.. So that means HUGE prizes.. it could even go something like this<br>
1st $10000,2nd $2500, 3rd $1000, 4th 750, 5th 500, 6th 400, 7th 350, 8th, 300... with 4000 dollars to spread between the next 42 people (assuming that the top 50 get prizes)... And keep on bearing in mind that this assumes NO DIRECT MONETARY SUPPORT from lucas, decipher, or corporate sponsors, and within 3 months, with adequate organization, wed have a self reliant pro tour giving out 10,000 dollar cash prizes to the winners.. The scnerio gets even better with sucess.. if lucasfilm can be persuaded to advertise itself by giving, say 20 thousand of its own money, and one of the many companies searching for a way to claw into a star wars marketing scheme (Hasbro, taco bell, mcdonalds, KFC, EVERYONE) would ante up something around the same amount (or a collection could conceivably reach even more) and decipher (being a small company) could be persuaded to ante up like 2 thousand  bucks (given that its name would be plastered all over everthing and its the one with the CCG liscense) the total amount of money (this is probably a pipe dream for the start at least) could reach from 80-100,000 dollars worth of prizes and support, which would allow us to include other attractions (famous star wars figure appearances, collectables stuff, etc.)... given a more modest scenerio of that type (10 grand from lucas, 2 from decipher 10 from corporate for 22 thousand) that would leave about 50,000 dollars worth of prizes, 10 thousand of which could go for promotions, and the prizes could look like this: 1st $15000, 2nd 5000, 3rd 2500, 4th 1000, 5th, 750, 6th 700, 7th, 550, 8th 500... That would be insane... someone could potentially live for an entire year based on a star wars tournament win!!.. thats incentive to start playing for sure, and would definitely bolster the game... there could be some type of young jedi event set up potentially as well..<br>
<br>
Anyhow, thats the gist of it, its pretty long, but its detailed, and its PROOF that we could have a star wars pro tour if we just had a few people that were pretty dedicated, liscensing, and 5000 dollars startup capital ..<br>
<br>
PS if anyone is interested in helping start a pro tour for swccg contact me, im looking for support and some ideas to bring a proposal to decipher.. thanks<br>
