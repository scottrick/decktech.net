(This first review centers on the characters and objectives in JPSD).<br>
<br>
    Let&#146;s start with the characters.  Lando has been released in many forms in the realm of SW:CCG.  We were all<br>
interested when he came out in Cloud City and we learned the rules of replacing a character.  Tamtel Skreej came out in Jabba&#146;s Palace and, while not as good as the Cloud City Lando (he deploys only on Tatooine), he was a spy and allowed undercover to deploy from reserve deck.  ECC brought Lando with Blaster Pistol and Lando in Falcon.	Lando with Blaster was perfect for a QMC deck.	He adds a destiny when with an alien and was absolutely incredible on Cloud City, especially at the Core Tunnel.  Lando in Falcon was a help to the light side as well, but lacked the ability to draw its own destiny.  However, put a pilot on it, throw in an Out of Nowhere and a Punch It! and you have a very powerful combo.  Lando with Vibro-Ax becomes the sixth different persona of Lando and is, perhaps, one of the best in today&#146;s meta.  Now don&#146;t go ballistic on me because of what I just said.  Think of what the most prominent deck in today&#146;s SW scene is:  Profit.  Lando w/VA is perfect in a Profit deck.  He&#146;s power four, depoy four (on Tatooine), adds a battle destiny, and can exclude a character.  A very good character with a properly tracked destiny.  Not only that, but he&#146;s a spy as well.  This Lando will work well in Profit decks everywhere.<br>
<br>
    The Dark Side main to compliment Lando w/VA is Mighty Jabba.  This is the third Jabba to be released and carries the stats of the original Jabba&#146;s Palace Jabba.  That Jabba deployed for 6 (-2 on Tatooine or Nal Hutta), forfeited 7, and was a 3-4 character.  Special Edition Jabba was only 2-3, but helped non-unique aliens immensly and also made Scum and Villainy immune to Alter.  Might Jabba is a 3-4 for 5 deploy (3 on Tatooine) and has a forfeit of 6.  He may escort a captive and must use +1 force to use his landspeed.  However, the best part comes in the other three sentences.  He is immune to attrition less than four and cannot be targeted by weapons unless all other aliens present have been hit.  This means that Jabba has no plans on going anywhere.  But the best part is the line which allows him to add a destiny when with an alien leader.  Think about it.  With the new dark objective, the dark side&#146;s &quot;Rep&quot; is also a leader.  Jabba plus Rep, and a few of his brethren would be unstoppable.	Mighty Jabba is a must in any My Kind of Scum/Fearless and Inventive deck.<br>
<br>
   The non-uniques are kind of interesting.  For the light side there is the Palace Raider.  While not too impressive, power: 1, ability: 2; when paired with a racing skiff, makes things interesting.  Put a palace raider on a racing skiff.  Power four, manuever four, landspeed 3, adds a destiny, and may move as a react, for free.  Not too shabby.  Put a couple around Tatooine and pile on your favorite mains.  react to stop a force drain and disembark in case they want to battle.  Not too bad.  The palace raider may not be placed in a lot of decks, however don&#146;t underestimate the power of weird looking guy on a racing skiff.<br>
<br>
    The mercenary pilot has much of the same abilities as the palace raider, with reversed stats (power 2, ability 1).	They add one other nice ability, though.  When a mercenary pilot is piloting a transport vehicle at a cloud sector, he can add a destiny to a battle at an exterior site below.  Plus, this ability is cumulative in the sense that each pilot can add to one battle, but it can&#146;t be the same battle, sorry.<br>
<br>
    At this point I&#146;m trying to determine what is more important:	Finishing this article so I can post it tomorrow, or getting sleep for my eight o&#146;clock German class in the morning.  As always, SW wins (I hate German).<br>
<br>
    The objectives take a little bit of thinking in order to understand.  They&#146;re not like operatives or hidden base where everything is pretty much self-explanatory.  Both objectives start, essentially, the same.<br>
<br>
Deploy Hutt Trade Route, (or Desert Heart) and a Jabba&#146;s Palace site.  May deploy Yarna d&#146;al&#146; Gargan (or Well Guarded).	Reveal one unique (*) alien from your deck whose lore specifies its species.  This card if your Rep.  For remainder of game, your Rep is a leader.  Yarna d&#146;al&#146; Gargan (or Well Guarded) is immune to Alter.	You may not<br>
deploy &#146;insert&#146; cards or operatives.	While a rancor is at Rancor Pit, trap door is immune to Bo Shuda (or While &#146;Frozen&#146; Han on table, rebels are immune to No Bargain and Bad Feeling Have I).  Flip this card if you occupy two battleground sites (must occupy a third with a non-unique alien of your Rep&#146;s species if a non-Tatooine location on table).<br>
<br>
This side is very nice.  Pick a rep.  If you are playing light side, why not Tanus Speejik and Eloms.  Eloms are good.	Playing dark?  How Myo and that wicked Abyssin deck you always wanted to play but was too afraid to.  Plus, Well Guarded is immune to Alter meaning your non-uniques are safe from Monnok.  You can&#146;t play inserts or ops, Oh well.  The other sentence doesn&#146;t really matter, either.  Additionally, this obj. is really easy to flip.  All you have to do is occupy two bg sites, probably three.  Still that&#146;s very easy, especially with a bunch of non-unique aliens.<br>
<br>
    The flip side benefits of this objective are numerous as well.  First, the light side.<br>
<br>
While this side up, once per turn you may cancel a Force Drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep.  Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Rep&#146;s species.  WHen two of your aliens are battling at any Tatooine location, add one destiny to total power.  FOr remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand.  Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 bg sites.<br>
<br>
    Ok, so you may want to pack a couple of copies of your rep, but look at the benefits.  Cancel a FD or a battle destiny.  Wow.  Plus, if your rep is killed just dploy another one from the objective.  Retrieval is included, too.	Now you can retrieve all those lost aliens.  Adding power destinies can help, as well.	And keeping it flipped<br>
is very easy.  All you have to do is occupy two bg sites.<br>
<br>
    The dark side is essentially the same, with a few other twists.<br>
<br>
While this side up, once per turn you may cancel a Forec Drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep.  Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Rep&#146;s species.  While Jabba and Bib on table, your battle destiny draws are each +2.  Wounded Wookiee is destiny +3.  Unless a non-Tatooine location is on table, your aliens are forfeit +2.  For remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand.  Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 bg sites.<br>
<br>
    The dark obj. also allows you to cancel FD&#146;s and BD&#146;s and retrieve aliens.  In addition, your bd draws are +2 when Jabba and Bib are on table.  This can be a big help to get rid of characters with immunity.  More often than not, a non-Tatooine location will be on table, so the forfeit +2 won&#146;t have much effect.  It&#146;s still a very good card, though.	Now let&#146;s take a look at what can be done with these objectives.<br>
<br>
    For the light, why not try Tanus Speejik and Eloms.  Eloms rock for starters, and Tanus makes them better.	Throw Tanus at the AC and use Bargaining Table with your Eloms.  Eloms will rule the world.  The dark has an even better potential.  How about Myo and Abyssins?  Myo at the AC with Abyssins running wild is absolutely phenomenal.  Have to lose two Abyssins from battle?  No problem.  Use two to send one to used and retrieve the other with the obj.  While these objectives may not see a whole lot of tourney action outside of JPSD games, they can still be used very well.<br>
<br>
   Well that&#146;s the end of this one.  It&#146;s 12:30 now and I&#146;m sick of writing.  I might write another article dealing with the effects, &#146;cause the weapons, sites, and skiffs are pretty easy to figure out.	Well, thanks for the read and enjoy the Jabba&#146;s Palace Starter Deck.<br>
