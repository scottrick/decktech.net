I&#146;m hoping to use this as a sounding board for some deck ideas.  I know Throdo will trash this.  He hates everything I write and I don&#146;t even know the guy.<br>
<br>
I know the top players (I used to be one of them) have a paranoid view of their decks.  Everything is hush hush except to 1 or 2 close friends, but I have no fear so here is my take on some post Tatooine deck ideas.<br>
<br>
Lets talk SAC:<br>
I here the rumblings on the horizon.  SAC is on the way back and why not.  Both sides have ample Jedi to SAC with.  Both sides now have killer interrupts that SAC would heavily disrupt.<br>
<br>
Look closer.  The LS can SAC freely.  Qui-Gon is a SAC machine even with Hunt Down adding 4 to the draw and there are plenty of Weapon Levitations to Sense with 3 heavily used Jedi with Sticks nowadays.<br>
<br>
The DS has a problem with SAC.  Sense can outright kill a QMC deck that uses Path, Edges, Power Pivots and Sorry about the Mess.  But WYS is still a very powerful deck.  Where did this deck go?  It&#146;s still there, maybe not a Palace Raider version, but the deck can still battle like no other and it eliminates the DS SAC.<br>
<br>
You&#146;ve got a DS deck with SAC.  You do well against most every deck except WYS.  The Objective that has 3 out of the top 5 LS deck types on Decktech.<br>
<br>
The DS can not afford to rely on SAC in a deck because of WYS.  The DS can play with a few Senses, but nothing on the order of shutting the LS down.  Not with WYS still a very viable winning deck type.<br>
<br>
The LS on the other hand can SAC freely.  They only have to worry about TINT.  That&#146;s a nice DS effect and it hurts LS SAC.  It doesn&#146;t hurt the Sense of the I Have You Now that saved the battle for the LS.<br>
<br>
On to decks.....<br>
<br>
LS Podracing:<br>
Looks good doesn&#146;t it.  Anakin draws 2 destiny each time.  Sometimes he draws 3 and you choose two.  Sebulba does the same thing.  That&#146;s right Sebulba draws 2 destiny each time also only one of his draws is always a 3.  Looking at it that way changes things.<br>
<br>
Podracing is only really viable for the Darkside.  Only Watto&#146;s box can give the 22 force swing.  Podracing in a LS deck slows you down and doesn&#146;t give a game swinging kicker in the end.  To many times Sebulba beats Anakin, but here are two LS racing decks I have messed with.<br>
<br>
MWYHL/Podracing:<br>
This can not work.  During the race the LS can draw sites and tests for race destiny.  Either you use them and not test till after the race or recycle them and slow down in the race.<br>
<br>
I suppose you could race after test 4 so you can pick out the race cards.  This way at least the DS won&#146;t have a racer unless they are holding their racer in their hand.  <br>
<br>
Profit/Racing:  Now this is not a bad idea.  The race gives the LS an eventual battleground to extend the Profit direct damage to.  How about a Brisky Mornin Munchin start so Jar Jar can wreck into Moff Jerjerod or Merrijk.  Add some SAC and 6 Jedi&#146;s (two each) and you have a fighting force on Tatooine.<br>
<br>
Retreive 6 force from the race, then 10 force from freeing Han, finally retreive 4 more force from I did it and you have retreived 20 force from 2 cards you start with and 1 you can pull before the game starts.  One thing, win the race or lose the game.  No easy task, trust me.<br>
<br>
WYS:<br>
This still works wonders.  I don&#146;t think racing is any good in this format.  You need your starting effects to much.  The Palace Raiders might be hurt by His Name is Anakin, but the rest of the smugglers shouldn&#146;t be to worse for wear.  There is still meta choices against this deck in alot of DS decks, so that shows you how powerful this deck can be.<br>
<br>
QMC:<br>
I have tested this deck alot.  Everything is nice, but something is missing.  You usually need the Superfalcon to hold Bespin, but you also usually need Han and Leia to hold the sites.  Also it is very hard to fight &#146;off planet&#146; with this deck.  It is definitly worth trying out.    <br>
<br>
It looks like it should work, but there is something preventing it from breaking into the top decks. I think it&#146;s the requirement to hold the system.  The DS can chase you off a single system, it&#146;s the chasing you down part they have trouble with.<br>
<br>
Or maybe it&#146;s the fact that there is always someone that will Sense the holy hell out of your interrupts.  They don&#146;t need to sense everything.  Only the Path that will save Melas from Vader/Tarkin.<br>
<br>
RST:<br>
This deck has problems.  It&#146;s another that looks very promising.  TIGIH scouts was very good pre-tatooine and everyone thought it would be easy to meld these two ideas together, but there is a problem.<br>
<br>
Unlike TIGIH Scouts, you can only drain for 1 on Endor until the Objective is flipped.  The DS can hold up in the Bunker with Vader and Maul until you send in the mains to clear them out.<br>
<br>
Once the mains are down on the table, the DS has no fear of them and can go along their merry way somewhere else.  The whole DS deck doesn&#146;t have to fear LS mains cause they are all trying to kick the two Dark Jedi out of the Bunker.  <br>
<br>
This isn&#146;t an uncommon occurance when playing RST.<br>
<br>
Let&#146;s look dark....<br>
<br>
I thought it would be great to have a platform to kick the two dark Jedi off with.  I could set up my drains in one place and send Maul and Vader out to fight on the LS locations. With Force Field, SAC and Weapon Levitations I thought they would be, at the least, very hard to get rid of.<br>
<br>
MKOS w/Jedi<br>
I can have some aliens, some Imperials and +2 to all my battle destiny draws.  The Aliens would hold Jabba&#146;s Palace and the Dark Jedi would go fight on the LS turf.  This worked fine except vs. one type of deck.  A Tatooine mains deck.  <br>
<br>
The LS doens&#146;t have to worry about holding down their locations.  Tatooine is their locations.  Instead of trying to win the Bunker from two Dark Jedi, while sucking MKOS Palace drains, the Tatooine mains deck waltzes right in and fights on my turf.  Not good for this deck.<br>
<br>
Hoth:<br>
The Ice Planet would make a terrific DS mains platform.  I get decent activation without giving up much to the LS.  I get a built in direct damage and an assured Decree working.  All the while I can fight off planet at the LS locations while having mine virtually locked down with At-At&#146;s and Ice Storm.<br>
<br>
Don&#146;t worry about Garrison.  Maybe you&#146;ll pull one off and maybe not.  It&#146;s the direct damage that counts and the platform for your mains to fight at his locations.<br>
<br>
I still think this can work.  It&#146;s got to much going for it.  You should give this a look see.<br>
<br>
Carbon Chamber:<br>
I admit, the fact the Superfalcon is off the table is almost enough to play this deck.  It doesn&#146;t play to bad.  You have 2 sites that must be defended.  The Carbonite Chamber and the Audience Chamber.  <br>
<br>
Against Profit it is very nice to have a Power 6, Defense Value 7, immune to all attrition Mighty Jabba.  This is another deck that can be toyed with succesfully.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down Racing:  <br>
I am bias towards this deck.  It is fast and furious.  The hardest part about this deck is getting over the fact you are playing only 4-5 characters.  I made this day one.<br>
<br>
Super high destiny, I&#146;m talking Steve Baroni style 6&#146;s and 7&#146;s.  Racing off the bat to get that 22 force swing.  6 duelers, Sticks, Weapon Lev&#146;s, Emperors to cover the Theatre and Counter Assault to kick it where the sun don&#146;t shine.<br>
<br>
The amount of direct damage is absurd and if the LS doesn&#146;t draw what they need in turn 1 or 2 it&#146;s lights out.  I&#146;ve seen a numbers version around SYCFA that sounded good to.  This might be the closest thing to a WYS the DS has.  I&#146;m talking about alot of damage done very fast type of deck.<br>
<br>
You don&#146;t need the numbers part.  Just rely on the Race, the Duel and the Visage.  Any little squirts can get Counter Assault.<br>
<br>
How about a deck that pulls ALL, I mean ALL of it&#146;s locations.  It starts with one battleground site and one battleground system and generates 14 force by itself by turn 3-4.  It drains for 11 from only 3 systems it pulls and it draws between 2-3 battle destiny at each system.<br>
<br>
Someone will win a major tournament with a build the Death Star deck.  Laugh all you want, but it&#146;s got it all built in and We Shall Double our Efforts severly hampers the LS attempts to blow it up.  <br>
<br>
Hell I&#146;ve got a DS Superfalcon wherever the Death Star sits and it does a 3 direct damage each turn.<br>
<br>
That&#146;s all I have to say about decks.  I know I&#146;ve missed some decks.  I haven&#146;t tried them all.  This is not supposed to be a &#146;be all end all&#146; list of every deck.  I&#146;m just throwing out ideas about deck archtypes that you can monkey around with yourself.<br>
<br>
I haven&#146;t tried EBO or Ties yet.  They could work.  I have noticed that most of the top decks.  I&#146;m talking about consistant decks the top players have made in the past have a couple of common themes.<br>
<br>
1) The abilty to at least put up a token resistance in both space an on the ground.  This allows Battle Order/Plan to slow down fringe decks (like Hunt Down Racing) and not affect you.  <br>
<br>
In space you might have 1-2 ships (Hidden Mains) and they can be used at the end game to surprise an opponent who has spread to thin.<br>
<br>
2) Retreive where you can.  This madness towards LS retreival is frightning.  I need to pack both Secret Plans AND SSPFT in all decks.  Even then I worry to much retreival will get through and I think I need a couple senses.  Of course the best way to counter retreival is kill all the characters.  No Characters, no Edges.  Sometimes it&#146;s not that easy.<br>
<br>
3) the ability to win by only draining on your locations and the ability to win by taking over your opponents locations.  <br>
<br>
If you can&#146;t do both, then someone will come along with something to screw you.  Once again, Hidden Mains (it&#146;s such a simple deck isn&#146;t it) can pling away at it&#146;s DB&#146;s and system.  It can also, more effectively go fight on the opponents locations.<br>
<br>
Big Blue ISB has good drains both in space and on the ground.  The deck can go fight the LS in space and on the ground.<br>
<br>
4)  The ability to hamper the opponents drains without fighting.  Sometimes the opponent has just to many guys at the Cantina or to many ships at Kessel.  <br>
<br>
In this case you need something to at least slow them down.  Battle Order/Plan, Menace Fades (and the ability to get it going by yourself!), Imperial Decree, ISB flipside, Any effect that cancels drains with ships/aliens, Undercover spies, etc.<br>
<br>
These are some common themes in the top decks.  You don&#146;t always need all of them, but a majority can go a long way.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the decks.  I look forward to seeing what you can come up with.  Finally my two cents on Tatooine:<br>
<br>
The decks now will be the most diverse bunch of decks we have ever had.  Nothing can be ruled out, because everything has a chance to win.  Numbers, SAC, ROPS, Mains, Swarm, etc....  There are so many cards, so many strategies, so many hoser cards, that there is no way to keep up with them all.  Now everything has a chance, except Dantoine Base Operations but you can&#146;t have everything.... where would you put it?<br>
