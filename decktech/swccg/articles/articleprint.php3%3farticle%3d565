What did you place?  Fifth?  First?  Eighth?  Dead last?	Why?  You can attempt to explain this in many ways.  Perhaps your decks weren't very good.  Maybe you drew incredibly bad destinies.  Perhaps you made a MISTAKE that cost you the game.  Be honest with yourself -- did you forget to move a lone character, save force for a react, or retrieve a force from Draw Their Fire?  I can't count the number of times I have read tournament reports where people have said 'I can't believe I forgot to do such-and-such!'  Hopefully after reading this essay, you can learn to analyze your mistakes, learn from them, and prevent them from happening again.<br>

'All men are liable to error; and most men are, in many points, by passion or interest, under temptation to it.'  -- John Locke<br>
<br>
'The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none.'  -- Thomas Carlyle<br>
<br>
Everyone makes mistakes.  That doesn't mean you are stupid, that is human nature.  Good grief, just recently during a game (my Ralltir Ops deck) I searched for the Death Star, deployed it hastily, and ended up taking a drain of 2 for nearly the entire game!  Imagine my frustration!...<br>
<br>
'A failure is a man who has blundered, but is not able to cash in the experience.'  -- Elbert Hubbard<br>
<br>
There is a well-used saying:  'Those who fail to learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them.'  Learning from your mistakes is essential to becoming a better SWCCG player.  Analyze your games and learn what you can do to prevent the errors from even happening!	For instance, referring to the mistake I made, I learned that it is usually better to deploy Coruscant with a Ralltir Ops deck BEFORE the Death Star (of course that depends on the situation, but I hope you get the point).  When analyzing and learning from a mistake, one must go through three steps:  identifying the mistake, finding out why the mistake was made, and preventing the mistake from happening again.<br>
<br>
IDENTIFICATION of the mistake is the first step.  Understand exactly what you did and exactly what happened.  Approach the problem completely objectively; then you can make an unbiased judgement, for denial does a SWCCG player no good.<br>
<br>
'It is one thing to show a man that he is in error, and another to put him in possession of the truth.'  -- John Locke<br>
<br>
'Every great mistake has a halfway moment, a split second when it can be recalled and perhaps remedied.'  -- Pearl S. Buck<br>
<br>
Realizing HOW and WHY a mistake was made is the next step.  It seems to me that forgetfulness and lack of focus are the primary cause of my mistakes in SWCCG.	It is quite common to forget to force drain or forget to use Visage.  These type of mistakes are plentiful in SWCCG, and it is critical to learn to remember some of these basic aspects in the game.  Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas in 'The Memory Book' have said 'When people say, 'I forgot,' they didn't, usually -- what really happened was that they didn't remember in the first place.' ['The Memory Book,' Lorayne and Lucas, Ballantine Books 1974]  This applies somewhat to SWCCG too.	TRAINING yourself to remember things is the only sure-fire way not to forget something.  Remember in the first place, and then forgetting is non-existent.<br>
<br>
Another reason people make mistakes is misunderstanding the usage of cards.  An important skill for a SWCCG player is simply to know exactly how people use cards.  This sounds a little strange at first for the experienced players, one might say 'of course I know the cards!'  But in that case, the problem has already been solved!  To the inexperienced players, knowing the cards backwards and forwards is the next step to becoming a great player.  This also relates to knowing the specific cards in your deck and how those cards can be used.  That is the problem with playing exact copies of net-decks (you might want to refer to one of my other articles, 'Mind Over Matter: A Study of Deck Cloning') without intense study and careful planning (no pun intended).  Know your cards!  Along with this, it is imperative to have a knowledge of the rules of SWCCG.  This is just as important, for a good player always knows the current rulings and the glossary definitions.  If you know the rules better than your opponent, you have an advantage.  This shows that PREPARATION makes the difference in a tournament.  There is no need to discuss this subject extensively, since I'm sure that you have read some of the great articles on tournaments on Decktech, so let us move on...<br>
<br>
Not anticipating your opponent's next move sometimes causes mistakes.	This doesn't mean that every time play a game you try to figure out the exact card he will use, when he will use it, how he will use it, and where he will use it.  This means THINK AHEAD.  Though you can't prepare for everything, you must be ready for anything!  Take it from the Boy Scouts, whose motto is BE PREPARED!  In my opinion, the best way to anticipate what the opponent might do is to imagine myself in their position and ask 'what would I do now?'  For instance, if you see your opponent massing a huge number of stormtroopers, you can bet that your opponent has a Trooper Assault and is preparing for a beatdown.  Therefore, you might want to consider keeping that Quite A Mercenary and Throw Me Another Charge in your hand.  That is a bit extreme since none of those cards are used extensively, but I think it illustrates the point effectively.<br>
<br>
Mis-perception is another cause of mistakes.  There are times that I have initiated a battle only to find that my opponent had double the power I thought he had!  Before you hastily make an important move in a game, remember to look at what's on the table and assess the situation.  Ways to assess the situation include counting the opponent's power before initiating a battle, asking the opponent how many cards are in his hand, or seeing how much force he is activating (that is extremely important, knowing your opponent's resources sometimes gives you an edge).<br>
<br>
PREVENTING the mistake from occurring again is the most important part of learning from your mistakes.	To do this, you need to have a plan.  Figure out exactly what you are going to do to prevent the mistake, and then implement that plan.  For instance, when Special Edition was first released, I was using a Hunt Down deck.  My problem was remembering to make my opponent lose force to Visage of the Emperor.  My solution was to write on a piece of paper 'DON'T FORGET VISAGE!' and put that beside my used pile.  This helped me to remember to use Visage every turn.  Many people put a rulebook or glossary beside their force pile to help them remember to force drain after activating, when I was a beginner I found this to be very helpful.  What this illustrates is the 'string around your finger' trick, using an object to help you remember to do something.  By the way, having  a 'string around your finger' is not a bad thing, in fact I find that even simply imagining that string can help me overcome some forgetfulness.<br>
<br>
Another method of remembering tactics is by association.  Suppose you have a thorough plan for your Speeder Ops deck.  Your first step is deploying sites, then you move on to 'X' action, and then 'Y' action, and then 'Z' action.  If you can associate the parts of that plan to something you know well, such as your house or school, you can better remember your plan.  It might be, 'I open the door to my house, that means deploy the sites.	Then I go to the kitchen and get a soda, that is action 'X'.	Then I turn on the radio, action 'Y'.  Then I go to my desk and do my homework, action 'Z'.'  It may sound absolutely absurd, but it truly can help!  How?  Because it organizes your thoughts so that you WILL NOT FORGET!  This may not work for decks that adapt to your opponent's strategy, but for some decks it can be very beneficial.<br>
<br>
The best tool of mistake prevention, though, is constant practice.  There is no substitute for drilling into your head again and again to search for a card with Ralltir Ops, to make the opponent lose force to Visage, or to never forget that Jabba (while at Audience Chamber) lets you activate a force whenever you force drain with an alien.  With practice, you can know your weaknesses and sometimes even correct them before they appear!  After all, 'The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything' (William Connor Magee).<br>
<br>
So now you have recognized your mistakes and you expect to do great in a tournament.  It is entirely possible, though, that you could lose a game.  Why?  I once heard on a television show, 'It is possible to commit no tactical errors and still lose.  That is not unfair -- that is life!'  Never forget that just because you are constantly aware of the game and preventing your mistakes, you are not invincible.  This is my perspective on the subject of mistakes.  If you have a good idea for your own self-improvement in SWCCG, don't hesitate to formulate that plan and apply it faithfully.  With discipline, dedication, and practice, you will improve your game!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
