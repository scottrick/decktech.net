Part of getting to that point is being able to manipulate factors in your favor ('luck') and getting all the small peices together to reach that point. This Article is about the small things, the overlooked things, and how to do them, use them, and improve with them.<br>
<br>
We'll start simple<br>
<br>
1. Playtest your decks<br>
<br>
    Playtest. Plain and simple, there are two or three ways to do this. First, after building your deck, take a look at the number of locations, and interrupts that you NEED to draw, and estimate when youd need to draw them in a game, and play a 'solo' game to figure out whether or not this is possibly under uptimum conditions. If it is, then play some practice games (prefferably against someone else) to find out exactly how well your deck performs under 'pressure', and also to formulate strategies against tough matchups before there's a tournament win on the line. This part is huge. When you have played games against a tough matchup, you can anticipate your opponent's moves AGAINST your deck, so you know the strategy that will be used to defeat you BEFORE it is used, so you can start countering it or preparing to counter it BEFORE it is employed. Also, it allows you to make inferences from 'rogue' decks to test decks to better anticipate the approach of rogue strategies against you.<br>
<br>
    I am NOT saying that you need to play games against every strategy. I AM however saying that if you want to beat the top players, youre going to have to know how your deck performs under pressure, and how to use it to beat its tough matchups. The only SURE way to know is through playtesting.<br>
<br>
2.  DO NOT PANIC<br>
<br>
    Were moving on in importance here, and also shifting gears to an often ignored part of playskill. Patience.  This is a logical progression from playtesting, because with knowledge and experience, the ability of the player to react to situations effectively is increased, and the less likely it becomes that the panic button gets pushed.<br>
<br>
    The idea i am trying to convey here is essentially that at every point in the game, you must have an idea of how you can win, what you need to do to get there, and how your opponent might try to stop you. This seems initially obvious, but note that it doesnt necessarily mean that you must stick to the strategy you had in mind for your deck, or stick to any particular course of action at all other than<br>
 one that would be condusive to victory.<br>
<br>
    For example, many inexperienced players are loathe to take heavy drains. When confronted with drains of 4 or 5 per turn, they start losing heavily from the hand, or they stop counting cards, or they throw half prepared forces at fortified positions.  A better way of looking at this might be losing 8 or 10 cards to force drains, but eventually taking those locations back (as your plan of victory) while cursorily setting up your own force drains elsewhere. This dilutes the opponent's focus, and sets you up for your big assualt. Or maybe you need to dig for your undercover spy. Anything. Just be aware of the conditions on the table, and	DO NOT assume the game is out of hand, until you have lost.<br>
<br>
3. Count Cards<br>
<br>
    This is so important. I saw Mike Fitzgrald write once that noone had ever given a lesson on here on counting cards, and its simply an amazing tool in the right hands. Destiny Tracking is essentially knowing at what point in your deck a certain card stands in order to be able to manipulate the position of that card within your life-force.<br>
<br>
    Counting cards has two main purposes: the draw, and the destiny. Drawing is essentially that after you draw your EPP Han For weapon destiny, you can track him into your force pile, and pick him up. Destiny is essentially that you can track your masterful move to the top of your deck (or the second or third card down or wherever) and draw it for weapon/battle/choke destiny. This is an important way to reduce luck in the mid and endgame, and if youre good enough to track your opponent's cards too, it can be another source of information about when/where to initiate battles, etc.<br>
<br>
    There are two ways to track destiny, the first is simple, the other is more effective, but much more complex.  The First way, to put it simply, is to figure out how many cards are going to be on top of your card in your deck by counting the piles (the bottom card in your used pile goes to the bottom of your reserve deck, so if you have 3 in reserve, 2 in used, you can activate 3 and it will be on top of your deck) and figuring out how many force to activate. This is usable by most players, involves very little mental effort (beyond rudimentary counting skills) and is good for weapon destiny and battle destiny.<br>
<br>
However, there is another way. This way is to LITERALLY count cards. It is much less obvious than actually physically counting the cards themselves, and can be much more deadly. I will summarize it here. To count cards this way, you must first determine the number of cards in your deck. you do this on the FIRST TURN of the game (doing the used pile thing the other way takes quite a long time to become fully effective). For instance, if you are playing with huntdown, and starting imperial arrest order without epic duel, you are starting 6 cards, and drawing 8, meaning there are 46 cards in your reserve deck to start the game. When you activate your 4 force, there will be 42 cards. if you spend all of your force that turn, the TOP CARD in your used pile will be card number 43 from the top of your deck. you track this card by remembering THAT number (43). In order to track its position, simply reduce that number by 1 each time a card is taken from the top of your reserve (ie, if you activate 6 next turn, deploy with choke vader, initiate battle, draw lightsaber, choke, and battle destiny, you subtract 10 from 43, and you now have 33 as the number you are holding). A way to complicate this a little farther is to remember things in a form similar to biblical verses, with the name or destiny of the card you are remembering and then the number of cards from the top it is (ie, if you are tracking a tarkin in the example above (you somehow know it is tarkin), remember 'tarkin:43' and subratct from the 43). Over the course of a couple turns, you will be able to commit it to your longer term memory, and it wont be ver difficult to remember, as long as you keep reminding yourself at the end of every turn where the card stands. When the number you are remembering reaches '1', the card has reached the top of the reserve deck, and you can either activate it (making it the top of your force pile, to be tracked in your force pile), or leave it at the top, or several cards down to draw at a specific point in your turn.<br>
<br>
    These are the two most reliable methods of tracking destiny that do not rely on any natural skill whatever to use. The second method is the better of the two, and with practice, gets incredibly easy and useful.<br>
<br>
4. Play Your Cards Like You Know You Will Win<br>
<br>
    Hedge your bets, and by all means, play cautious, but be confident that whatever play style you use is going to be effective at winning you games. Dont hesitate.  Dont shy away from doing something that has a good chance of winning you the game because you arent sure, or youre intimidated. Dont hold off on playing that lost in the wilderness on vader this turn because you dont know if you have a 3 or 4 on top. Play it. And when you play it, KNOW youre going to pick a 3 or 4.<br>
    This is so huge, because so many games are won and lost on the mindset of the players, and i see a lot of pretty good players win games they shouldnt against less skilled players because their opponents assumed greatness or assumed defeat before the battle was joined.  By all means, prepare yourself to do what you need to do to win within the game, but once you are prepared, DO IT.<br>
<br>
<br>
5.  Be CONCIOUS of grimnock, not afraid of it<br>
<br>
   Dont draw 45 cards if your deck is 80% duplicates and you need those duplicates to win. But if you need one of those 45 to win, and the duplicates are irrelevant, then by all means draw 45. Be confident that your choice is the right one, do what is necessary to win, and do not be afraid of ANYTHING, EVER. Ive seen people stop drawing at 12, and tell me things like 'i never go over 12 cards'. So what? If i need something, and it isnt in the 12 cards, i draw up to 13. By all means, YOU can draw up to 13 looking for a monnok. and by preparing for monnok by limiting its effects in deck choice, the lost monnok wont hurt too bad, and the used one isnt so terrible anyway.	Never let the THOUGHT of a card beat you over the PLAY of the card.<br>
<br>
6.  Be able to beat manipulators<br>
<br>
   pack the counters to quick manipulation so you can get some representatives of your cause out on the board early, or build in some resistance to it in your deck.  Draw up to 12 as early as possible so the NEED to use all that force to check your hand. Play tunnel vision if you have to to grab cards to crush that early myoom.  Play Grabbers for Scanning Crew and a Dangerous Time. Play Shocks for high destiny and for anti screw.  Test your deck vs the Manipulator and find out how well it does, and how long it takes to get your mains on the board. Be ready, and not scared.<br>
<br>
7. Be able to beat numbers<br>
<br>
    Know the small tricks on this one.. if you have to, break down your activation into how much you need to force drain, and concentrate on tracking cards that shuffle your deck, to reduce the probability the inserts come up. if youve got dagobah, search every turn and screw the verification rule. Activate your whole reserve deck if you dont have to pay to drain. Use all the pre-Torture/DFTD tricks and youll be fine. Deploy carefully to maximize your destiny number .. if you dont need the mains out, dont play them.. play wedge,torynn farr, bothan spy for your total of 11 and sneer at numbers. Do whatever it takes to win, and dont be rigid and inflexible. play counters to numbers if your deck needs it.<br>
<br>
8. Know how to beat spread drain<br>
<br>
   Monnok/Grimmtash reduces their ghhhks to one, and lay two moderate beatdowns for a bunch of force.. enforce battle plan, and be able to keep the claw off of you. Use weapons/elis to try and bounce around. play controls or undercover spies to reduce drains, and keep the fight to just a few sites. Play retreival or DTF/FS to retreive for every little battle. Use the force they provide against them, and watch where you commit.<br>
<br>
9. Know how to beat ops.<br>
<br>
   Set up some big drains and defend them, while you go after the ops and force them to use thier ghhhks. Watch out for speeders in LS ops, and walkers in DS. Try and enforce Battle Order/Plan. First jedi test,WNMOG, Bright Center, and TPTIFF all make a difference. Grimnock helps, oola helps, myoom helps. Order to engage helps. Undercovers help. Cancel their drains, make them pay, and apply judicious beatdowns. Set up a big drain somewhere else, and watch the ops deck die.<br>
<br>
These small tricks go a long way in increasing playskill with just a little practice, but nothing beats experience. Take a few decks off of this site from some of the top players, and play aginst your own. Read TRs and find decks that are similar to test against. Incorporate new knowledge into your old decks, and always stay flexible. Count cards, know how to beat degenerate strategies, and above all, DONT PANIC, and HAVE CONFIDENCE.<br>
<br>
youll do fine.<br>
