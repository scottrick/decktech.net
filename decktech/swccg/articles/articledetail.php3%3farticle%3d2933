Well, I am convinced that if Twain were alive today, he would say the same thing about Watch Your Step in the post Reflections 3 environment.  Yes, many players are applauding Decipher for finally killing WYS, but they applaud prematurely.  As Hayes Hunter said, A Useless Gesture is just that--A Useless Gesture.  Yes, the rumors of WYS&#146;s demise ARE greatly exaggerated.<br>
<br>
It has always been one of the most fascinating phenomena about SWCCG circles to me.  Star Wars players consistently overreact to new cards in new sets before the sets are released.  It happens like clockwork.  A new set is primed for release and at the same time, the Star Wars community is in an uproar, because some new card is breaking the set, or a deck is dead.  It&#146;s like thousands of Chicken Littles running around crying &quot;The Sky is falling!  The Sky is falling!&quot;  And just as with Chicken Little, our words have no weight, for we are seldom justified.  Is A Useless Gesture different?  Could WYS be dead?  Perhaps . . . but doubtful.  True, A Useless Gesture hinders WYS, but by how much?<br>
<br>
A Useless Gesture has brought some parity to this often-abused deck archetype.  Anybody who has ever played WYS or played against it (which is to say everybody) will openly admit that WYS&#146;s interrupt usage is incredibly abusive.  True, A Useless Gesture has somewhat corralled that abuse . . . but nothing more.  It is NOT a magic bullet.  It is NOT WYS kryptonite.  The sky is NOT falling.  As long as WYS smugglers add destinies and forfeit bonuses, WYS will not die.  As long as WYS gains an activation bonus, while hindering the opponent&#146;s activation, WYS will not die.  As long as WYS has the Cantina and Kessel at its disposal for drains, WYS will not die.  No, WYS is not dead.  Cancel the funeral arrangements, and put your black away, because proclaiming WYS is dead just because it can&#146;t play a couple of interrupts from the lost pile is like saying Dinner is served just because you turned on the oven . . . there is so much more involved.  <br>
<br>
Let&#146;s take a look at the effect that A Useless Gesture will have on WYS.  There are four interrupts that predominantly abuse the Interrupt From Lost Pile aspect of WYS.  They are: A Step Backwards; Dodge; Control &amp; Tunnel Vision; and On The Edge.  There are other interrupts, but these are tops on the list.  Now, let&#146;s analyze how AUG will affect these interrupts.  With ASB, due to Defensive Shields and new game mechanics, Podracing will be far less popular than it has been, so don&#146;t expect to see a ton of WYS decks packing multiple ASBs.  But even if they do, A Step Backwards is a card that you use primarily for podracing.  That means, it gets used early in a game when your focus is on Podracing.  Therefore, when ASB sees play, there should not be three smugglers on the table.  Next, we have Dodge.  Dodge is used in the early game to secure a quick flip, so you can deploy smugglers sparsely with little fear of a beat down.  It too will be used without three smugglers on the table.  And with Control &amp; Tunnel Vision, WYS players use it in the early game to pull the necessary cards for their strategy.  Once again, there will not be 3 smugglers on the table.  In all of these cases (I&#146;ll get to On The Edge presently), there is one thing in common.  They occur early in the game when there are rarely 3 smugglers on the table, which is to say before A Useless Gesture has taken effect.  Therefore, these interrupts will often (but not all the time) still go to your lost pile.  This translates into continued interrupt abuse . . . but not ABUSE of interrupt abuse.  The only appreciable effect AUG will have on WYS interrupt usage is that most WYS decks will change their C &amp; TV allocation from three slots to two.  However, AUG would affect On The Edge, which gets used in the late game . . . but this too means nothing.  Something Special Planned For Them and Do They Have A Code Clearance had already accounted for repeating retrieval interrupts.  AUG is just another weapon at the DS&#146;s disposal.  So, when you get right down to it, AUG has done next to nothing.  True, to say that it will have no effect against WYS is a gross underestimation of its usefulness.  There will be game situations when WYS players will change their strategy due to an interrupt being, or conceivably going, out of play.  But this should only affect 3-5 plays in any given game versus WYS.  That&#146;s hardly game breaking.<br>
<br>
Essentially, what A Useless Gesture has done is created a grabber for all lost interrupts.  Most decks are hindered by grabbers, but ask anyone, if a grabber can beat your deck.  You&#146;ve built a bad deck.  WYS in the post R3 environment is no different.  By simply altering your strategy a little, you can turn AUG into an advantage for you.  Losing a lost interrupt will become like losing no force at all.  You have two options.  You can lose the interrupt, play it from your lost pile, and place it out of play.  OR you can play it and place it out of play.  Obviously, the first option is better . . . and anytime you can turn losing force into losing no force, you&#146;ve done yourself a favor.  Hence, in the post R3 environment, you&#146;re going to see smart players start abusing Lost Interrupts in new ways.  For this reason, AUG has changed the dynamics of WYS decks, but not killed it.  And if you&#146;re still not convinced, let me remind you that every other deck gets by without playing interrupts from the lost pile.  What makes you think that WYS can&#146;t survive under the same constraints?  Are those other decks dead?  Not at all.  Each of those decks have OTHER benefits which make them viable options.  WYS has other options, too.  Let&#146;s take a look at them.<br>
<br>
Now, WYS is my favorite LS objective.  I have played WYS since it was released.  I gravitated to WYS because of five benefits the deck archetype affords you: Battle bonuses, Force management advantages, Superior locations, SAC protection, and Interrupts from the lost pile.  As I reflect on my impressions of WYS, I remember that the interrupts from the lost pile aspect has always placed last among these five benefits in my estimation.  Let&#146;s look at the other four.<br>
<br>
Battle Bonuses<br>
<br>
WYS gives smugglers additional destinies and forfeit.  This has always been the prime aspect of a solid WYS deck in my mind.  WYS decks, even bad ones, average around a 3.0 for destiny.  Therefore, on two destinies, any WYS deck should blind draw a 6 at the least . . . and in the late game, when you&#146;ve pulled characters and starships, that same deck should blind draw an 8.  This translates to an average power of 9 for any 2 smugglers.  AND, that attrition will crack the immunity of almost every character the DS has to offer.  Also consider that if you battle effectively, a 9+ power will rarely lose a battle, and even if it does, after you factor in forfeit bonuses, you should only lose one smuggler.  Therefore, 3 mediocre smugglers can successfully battle any DS force at any time with minimal losses and remain a threat.  This, in my opinion, is the cornerstone of WYS&#146;s success.  If any DS deck is to beat WYS, it must attack WYS at this point.  Any other method of attack will prove ineffective against a good player . . . and A Useless Gesture does nothing to curtail these destinies or forfeit bonuses.  Therefore, it is not an effective counter to WYS.<br>
<br>
Force Management Advantages<br>
<br>
WYS gives the LS an activation bonus while hampering the DS&#146;s activation at non-battlegrounds.  Thus, when you account for the fact that all of WYS&#146;s deployment costs are highly economical, WYS can simply deploy more . . . faster.  Additionally, in a well designed WYS deck, there are three cards that assist in the Force choke: Goo Nee Tay, Battle Plan, and Don&#146;t Do That Again.  Now, Battle Plan and Don&#146;t Do That Again have just been made Defensive Shields, therefore there is no reason for them to EVER be excluded from a WYS deck.  As Hayes Hunter so astutely observed, there are only 2 ways that a DS deck has the capacity to out-activate a WYS deck without giving up force icons.  They can either employ non-battlegrounds or Mobilization Points to meet their activation needs.  Well, WYS&#146;s 7-side wrecks non-battleground activation, and Don&#146;t Do That Again wrecks Mobilization Points.  Therefore, there is no way that a DS deck can out-activate WYS without giving away a ton of force icons.  This means that in all situations, especially with low-deploy smugglers, WYS has the force activation advantage.  And anyone who has played force choke, or played against it (which again is to say everypne) knows how big of an advantage this can be.  Then, on top of all of this, when you add Goo Nee Tay and Battle Plan to the WYS activation advantage, it becomes impossible for the DS to mount any kind of effective attack.<br>
<br>
Superior Locations.<br>
<br>
I have always maintained that the best decks are balanced decks.  And in most cases, the best balanced decks are decks that provide both ground and space battlegrounds from the onset of the game.  WYS does this.  But not only does WYS do this, it goes a step further.  It gives its player Kessel and the Cantina--two locations that combine for a drain of 5.  Then, on top of that, you have the option of setting up I&#146;ll Take The Leader Docking Bay drains.  And once you&#146;ve sent smugglers both to space and to ground, Battle Plan and Menace Fades kick in.  So, at that point, the only chance a DS deck has against WYS is to arrest space from the smugglers.  Otherwise, they won&#146;t be able to drain and deploy in the same turn.  It&#146;s a bad scenario.  No, I can&#146;t think of a single deck in the Star Wars environment that gives either side better locations without surrendering force icons.<br>
<br>
Sense and Alter Protection<br>
<br>
Well, if it wasn&#146;t before, SAC IS dead!  It&#146;s gone.  If you liked it, you&#146;re only hope is playing in Episode I tournaments.  No, I don&#146;t expect that Mark Twain would reprise any great quotes for SAC as he might for WYS.  And what does this mean for WYS?  It means what it always has--that WYS&#146;s interrupts have almost no chance of being cancelled.  And with no fear of interrupts being cancelled, LS players can set their strategy without reservation, because their interrupts will almost never backfire on them.  And interrupts playing with impunity gives any WYS player a psychological advantage.<br>
<br>
Now, quickly, go back and think about these four advantages.  Think about what they mean for a well-designed WYS deck.  Now tell a new player . . . one that is completely unfamiliar with Watch Your Step . . . tell them about WYS&#146;s destiny and forfeit advantage and its guaranteed superior activation and its superior locations and its sense and alter impunity . . . then add that the deck is dead, because there&#146;s a card out there which in the mid and late game won&#146;t allow that player to play interrupts from the lost pile.  That new player will look at you completely dumbfounded.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I didn&#146;t think decks were supposed to be able to play interrupts from the Lost Pile.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;They&#146;re not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So how is this objective dead, with all of the advantages you&#146;ve just described to me, just because there&#146;s a card out there that stops it from playing interrupts from the lost pile . . . which other decks can&#146;t do anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OH YEAH!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mark Twain would be proud!<br>
<br>
