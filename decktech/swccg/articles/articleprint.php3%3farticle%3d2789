rocking starships from the reserve deck, and also deploy docking bays to activate<br>
more force, also your bountys are forfeit +2, and immune to Goo Nee Tay, it압 important that<br>
you don앖 flip your great &quot;effect&quot;, cause than it will be hard. One problem that you have is<br>
that you only activate 8 or more force, and the bountys are very expensive,<br>
but if you deploy Jabba압 Palace, and play Lower Passages, and Rancor압 Pit you <br>
will activate enough force, or you play one or to docking bays and mobilization points, No Bargain, <br>
Imeprial Barrier, and some None Shall Passes, will keep your Audience Chamber clean, <br>
and you must stay in your Chamber, but with &quot;Power Of The Hutt&quot;, it압 very easy to protect <br>
your chamber with powerful aliens, and than you can deploy Scum one of the best cards in the <br>
whole star wars game [ the best card is Sienar Fleet System], if you deploy Scum you can rock everbody<br>
the best combo is scum with First Strike, that are 3 force in each battle, and your bountys are ruf.<br>
than you must pull out your gailid, if gailid is on table i압 very hard for your opponent, cause you앏l give him <br>
rocking drains, and he can앖 modifey or cancel your drains, cause you앏l play Hutt Influence,<br>
after some battles and drains the gane is over. Now it comes one of the most important facts, the<br>
opponnet must come to you, or to tatooine, or he will lose over 10 Force over the whole game cause he need a character at<br>
a tatooine battleground site, and that is your chance, if he deploy some sucking rebels like luke, leia, ben<br>
or han, you can kick him with rocking characters like, Aurra Sing, Boba Fett with gun, IG with gun or Dengar with Gun<br>
in combo with Jabba Through with You, that will kill him. I Think Court is ruf and very very hard to beat.<br>
IT`S ALSO ABLE TO BEAT BASTIAN`S WATCH YOUR STEP DECK.<br>
Now I앏l give some examples how you can play against some light side decks.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base :<br>
<br>
Hidden Base is very hard but it압 perfect against Court, you are able to deploy <br>
powerful bounty ships from reserve deck every turn, and so you have a good chance<br>
to probe the base. The second thing is he will play ruf mains in the sky like <br>
Han Solo, Lando and that is good for you cause now you can battle him at sites,<br>
Republic압 are able to come into the audience chamber, but than you just play an imperial <br>
barrier, or you deploy one 4-Lom With Gun against Qui- Gon Jinn or Padawan Leader<br>
but who plays Pdawan Leader ???? if he deploy something to sarlaccs carkoon he won&#146;t leave<br>
the carkoon, cause you앏l eat somebody, and make him out of play, spys, smugglers, won&#146;t come<br>
to ephant mon, and if he deploy an spy at a other location deploy a bounty and play Hutt Smooch.<br>
If He flip his objective he can&#146;t cancel your drains cause you are playing Hutt Influence. and menace fades<br>
it압 also stupid against you.<br>
<br>
Podracer Decks :<br>
<br>
I prefer that you always play podracer in every dark deck, it압 just 1 card and can help you<br>
play Selbulba`s Pod, cause in the first round you can use 2 Force and your opponent won&#146;t <br>
draw race dest, and if you start with a high dest it will be hard for &quot;sweety&quot; anakin to win the race<br>
<br>
<br>
QMC :<br>
<br>
That is very hard but you can win it, the most important think is that you deploy every turn one<br>
starship to bespin system start with IG-88 in his ship he can&#146;t be battled but if you battle <br>
you add one dest, than deploy powerfull ships like Dengar, Zuckuss, Bossk, Virago With Xizor<br>
or Guri in Stinger. If You Control the system he will die, cause he will lose many many force<br>
if he battles in the space, cause he can&#146;t play Punch It, or Out Of Nowhere, and he isn앖 immune <br>
to attrition. Also he can&#146;t deploy Bespin Celebration. But don&#146;t Forget do not battle alone at<br>
cloud city inetrior sites, cause your opponent will play Dodge or Path Least Of Ressistance.<br>
