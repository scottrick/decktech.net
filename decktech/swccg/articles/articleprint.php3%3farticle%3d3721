It*s like an autobiography.  It*s been a great ride and will continue for a long time.  This might have mostly come from me being bored and unable to sleep.  I will be knocked for reviews and that*s if you even read any of it.  I doubt anyone will read it all.  It is late I am bored the grammar will be bad the only help it does have is Microsoft words spelling and grammar check. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
      It all started a few years back.  The shop was called Newsland.  My uncle had taken my cousin and me there.  I was really into Star Trek and he really liked Star Wars.  The shop had this stand that sold all kinds of cards.  I had tried magic before and thought I might buy some of those cards.  Well we then came across something called Star Trek The Customizable Card Game.  It was a starter deck.  I quickly grabbed it.  My cousin then saw the Star Wars starter deck.  He got that and we both bought the respective decks.  We got back home and decided to try the games.  We couldn*t figure out how to play Star Wars (we decided to look at the pictures and figure it out rather than reading). We quickly lost interest and tried out the Trek cards.  We figured this game out and my cousin really liked it.  It was ok so I would play with him on occasion but didn*t play too much.  A few months later at school I noticed a group of guys playing the Star Wars game.  <br>
Enhanced Premiere was just released.  One of the people playing was a guy I had known since first grade and had talked to him a lot but never really been real close friends.  His name is Chris Compton.  Well he was in my math class and we talked quite a bit then because we were among a handful of seventh graders in the advanced eighth grade class.  I went back to that shop Newsland and bought EPP Luke with Lightsaber package.  I talked to Chris again and convinced him to teach me how to play.  He had been playing an old school Dark Deal Deck and QMC beats with out the beats but among us was a decent deck among us.  I handed over my cards to him and he made me a lightside and a darkside with his extra cards and my cards.  He agreed and then taught me how to play the game.  My early decks were…. cloud city and cloud city.  Well I didn*t win a game till a kid named David O*Brien started to play with us.  He bought a lot of Hoth cards and thus played Hoth decks.  Chris bought a lot of Cloud City, thus he played Cloud City.  Well I bought a Degobah pack and got a Jedi test… I loved the idea.  I bought so much Dagobah to get what I needed to play.  I also got some bounty hunters in the process.  All I needed was Yoda I saved the money I needed to buy the 20-dollar card from a shop called Mile High Comics.  I went to a shop called Game force and they had some cards, I bought three packs of Dagobah, I got my Yoda and saved the 20 dollars I was going to spend.  So I loved this idea of Jedi training and carbon freezing cause of bounty hunters.  I ended up making a Mind What You Have Learned and a Carbon Chamber Testing.  Then it happened Chris and our friend Jakob Brown (one of the people in that first group I saw play the game) found out about tournaments.  They tried to go to some Jakob did play in one but Chris had not gone to one where other people showed up.<br>
       Then we found out Decipher was going to have a Grand Slam in Colorado, 20 minutes from where we lived.  We were now in ninth grade and met a guy named Cody Jewell.  He learned quickly and really enjoyed the game.  It was now Chris, Jakob, Cody and Me I was happy cause I could beat Cody and I had never beaten Jakob because his dad collected the game and he owned every card.  Chris was probably the best player among and I rarely beat him cause he didn*t own too many cards.  It was the eve before the grand slam.  We were all so happy.  Chris and me spent the night at Jakobs house because his dad was going to drive us.  Well Cody*s mom was too overprotective to let Cody come over but said if Jakobs dad was going to stay at the event he could play.  Well we didn*t know his dad wasn*t but figured she would drop him off and it*d be fine.  Then it happens that night Jakobs dad*s car broke.  We weren*t sure what we*d do.  He said it looked bad.  We were worried but kept hope.  We stayed up late playing and preparing for the event.  <br>
     As it were fate they fixed the car with plenty of time to spare.  We get there early register, and pay the fee.  We walked around a little and bought some random cards.  Our older friend James Beckner was there so we stood by him to talk to him.  I went down stairs to greet Cody whose mom was following close behind.  I gave him a bad look and he knew what I meant.  He preceded to register and the paid the fee.  He tried to shoo her away but she was intent to make sure Jakobs dad was there.  We slowly walked up the stairs unsure what to do.  We got to the top of the stairs and I pointed to where Jakob was.  She saw Jakob talking to James and she said good-bye to Cody and left.  She thought that James was Jakobs dad Roger so it seemed like it was fate for us to play in this tourney.  We all stick close together nervous, as it*s our first tourney for me Chris and Cody.  We all knew that a guy named Brian Hunter was rated number 1 in the world and lived in Colorado and was sure to be there.  All I knew was that he was supposed to look like Jesus.  Well then I see a guy wearing a Yoda t-shirt who resembled Jesus a little.  I looked at Jakob and he nodded his head.  We were all in awe and tried not to stare, we were unsure how serious people might take this game and didn*t want to be noticed I guess.  We find out we need deck lists so after quick penmanship we are all set and ready to play.  The tournament director was Joe Helfrich.  <br>
     First round pairings are called and the tension is high.  There seems to be a sudden sense of relief as Brian Hunter is paired against some pour guy.  Then I am called to play some guy named Kyle Craft.  I had no Idea who he was…no body told me he was one of the best players in that room.  First turn I show I am a scrub…I deploy Luke with MWYHL and thought he was deploy –3 like Yoda, Kyle shows me I am wrong which is cool.  Kyle was really cool about the game because he knew this was my first sanctioned game ever.  Immediately people drop after the first game so there will be 2 byes in the next game.  I get one of those byes.  I play a fun game with this kid who also gets a bye.  Well I start a card he doesn*t like to see so he immediately quits.  Well next game I get paired against him.  I start that card.  I win that game which is cool.  Its only now that I realize that after game three of that tourney I am at one of the higher tables thanks to a win against a kid 5 years younger than I and a bye. I then go on to lose games 4,5,6,and 7.  Game 8 I am pitted against my good friend Cody.  Cody is 0-7 now, he swears to this day that he had a bye but he didn*t he was begging for one but there was no byes left.  Well he is playing a lightside pile of jawas.  I get IG-88 in my opening hand.  I quickly get ugnaughts and ugloste setup, only for him to release his captive.  I place a bounty on Farmboy Luke.  He steals my IG-88 early and IG-88 goes off on my characters killing me…this sucks.  Well I finally get what I need but got like 20 cards in hand so I play my reactor terminal, he alters with an ability 2 jawa HORSE@#$%.  I retrieve it and play it again, altered with an ability 1 Jawa. @#$%.  Well I am in a bad spot and need to do something but what I need is in my lost pile.  It takes me a while and I start to get red…I couldn*t stand the thought of losing to Cody.  I realize I haven*t retrieved my bounty.  I do that then freeze Luke.  We think time is over because we are the last game and everyone crowds the td and we think we hear time was called.  I kind of raise my hands and look over and a guy named Van Melancon comes over and tells us we still have time and need to hurry.  A crowed gathers to watch us scrubs since we are the last game playing.  I initiate battle and Time is called.  I win by a few cards and we see what would have happened. Well it turns out he would have lost the rest of his life force.  Cody is given a Darth Vader Dark Lord of the sith for sticking through all 8 games though he didn*t win. (Authors note: Joe Helfrich is really cool to the players who take last and don*t give up, I have seen him give extra prizes to the last place and new players all the time and I think that is really cool.)  Well for my first tournament I go 3-5 with a bye, timed win, and full win over some 5-8 years younger than me…they got words for people like this…scrub!!  <br>
       So Chris, Jakob, and I go to a couple tournaments in the following months in a shop called CollectorMania in Parker Colorado. Scott Gaeta is the tournament director and he is a cool guy.  Well we continue to be scrubs of Colorado except Chris is becoming a better player than us and actually goes up in ratings.  I drop down to near 1400.  Then it happens Jakob moves to Nebraska.  We don*t go to any tournaments that summer.  Chris then gets into a relationship with a girl he*s known for nearly 10 years.  Its all-good till she basically whips him, he*d be so dumb and do anything for her.  Well Jakob moves back and He and I start to go to tourneys, Cody comes sometimes but now we get this guy named Bobby Sorrentino into the game.  Well Time goes on and Jakob quits…its me and Bobby, my mom gives us rides, sometimes my grandma.  Our state tournament comes around and I win three games gaining some rating points.  <br>
Well we go to this con called BenCON, its not that big but Tatooine just came out so we play and we each go 3-3 both days.  Well my collection has been growing and I have started going 3-3 consistently so my rating jumps around in the 1500- 1400*s.  Well Jakob gets back in the game and its time for the Qualifier weekend in Colorado.  We have a old school premier, new hope and Hoth sealed deck, trouble strikes right away I draft and play Mike Girard first game…well I cant open the freaking wrapper on the premier starter deck.  It gets really sad when I need Girard to open it.  I was so embarrassed.  Well I basically suck it up throughout the entire sealed deck and then there was a warm up tourney and I sucked there and the next day we had the qualifier and I did decent but not great.  But it was that Sunday where we were looking to have the most fun…it was the team tourney.  It was going to be me Jakob Cody and James.  Well me Jakob and Cody think it will be fun to show up in weird hats and masks.  We dub our team, team scrub.  Well here is where it gets bad, we had high hopes but all end up losing our first two games…then James wins one, Cody wins one and I come out with two, Jake lost all his games, we are in last so we get some random rares which we draft in order of who did best…I got like something.  It was terrible.  <br>
      Well I had been buy cards by the boxes and started getting quite the cards and started to make some decent decks.  I continued to go to a bunch of tournaments and then a con rolls around called TactiCON it would host DPC Denver, and a bunch of other events…. I plan on playing them all I get the ultimate SWCCG card game pass which lets me play anything only additional cost I need to pay is buy packs for an EP 1 sealed deck.  Well I will need 6 rides total, 3 day to and from each day.  Well my mom can drop me off, but she is going to the mountains after.  My Grandma Linda can Pick me up, and drop me off the next day.  My Aunt will Pick me up and then drop me off and then my mom will pick me up when she gets back Sunday night.  Ok cool.  So I get there a few hours before the start and I have all my cards packed.  I buy some cards as always and bust out a Hunt down Podracing deck I had started making earlier.  I make this deck after seeing Josh Bader play it a few weeks before hand and also use the ideas from a guy I think name Ray Hornstien or something from Florida when I played in a tournament out there when I was on vacation.  I basically put my 3 Vaders in my deck podracing Hunt down the stuff it needs some dueling stuff and 7*s any 7*s.  Well the next player to get there is none other than Josh Bader himself.  We play a couple games and he kills me with his senate decks.  He takes a look at my deck and gives me some pointers.  I borrow some cards from people and play in the warm up.  Well it was pretty cool the Hunt down won both of its games and my Lightside only loss was to Brian Hunter so I go 3-1 and place high.  And one of Colorado*s top players Chris Fanchi went 1-3.  Well he*s shocked that he did poorly and I did well. So to this day when we*re talking and disagreeing I*ll say “so umm who went 1-3 in a simple warm up tourney” so he says that TactiCON is when I started being good. So Hunt down wins 6 out of eight games on the weekend only losing to Tom Kathmans HB pods.  My LS does ok so I do pretty well over all.  The next few months goes weird.  I win about 18 straight games with my Hunt Down that keeps evolving but I also lose 18 straight lightside games.  I can*t find a lightside I like.  Finally I make my version of WYS that uses a balance of most versions.  I start Going 4-2 in tourneys and finally brake 1600 I was so happy.  <br>
     Well I talk to Chris Compton again and he is convinced to play again.  So we get into his truck I hand him his decks.  Good old Dark Deal he is used to and a HB Pods deck I had worked on.  We offer Brian Hunter a ride so we pick him up and drive to Colorado Springs Chris makes the 2 hour trip in like an hour so we are early, we talk for a while and realize nature is calling us all.  Well the card store is closed and a crowed is in front of it, we get out of the truck and walk into the Office Max next store.  As we pass everyone in front of the card shop watches cause they thought they were safe from Brian Hunter so far away from him…they don*t know he*s lost a game the day before and is looking for blood.  Well Compton does remember how to play he wins his first four game.  Well the next two he*s got Hunter, well he does manage to give hunter a run for his money with the HB but gets his Dark Deal wrecked.  He Goes 4-2 takes 4th I take 3rd going 4-2 and it*s a real good tournament.  Well soon after I have the best tourney of my life.  I go 5-1 only losses to hunter and take second.  I do this a few times and soon after I break 1700.  Soon after decipher loses the license which pisses me off.  I jump around in the 1700*s traveling around Colorado playing in as many tourneys as I can.  <br>
     DPC Vegas is announced.  I figure I*ll go. Well do to reasons beyond my control I @#$% my car up and can*t go.  Well I play in a tournament here in Colorado and I go 4-2 again only losses to Hunter. Then May 24, 2002 decipher updates the tourney and I finally break 1800 well I am at exactly at 1800.  I will be traveling to The Tatooine regional and I am confident that I will be able to place high.  I may make the trip out to origins but at TactiCON 2002 we will have mini-open and last year TactiCON was the best 3 days of Star Wars I ever played I have confidence I can do it again this year.<br>

To anyone I don*t put in slops (there won*t be many of them)<br>
To Jakob Brown, even though we don*t see eye to eye anymore you were the coolest friend to play this game with because we were always so evenly match we had a lot of close games a lot of ideas and a similar play style, if we never talk again I*ll always remember how fun this game was for us.<br>
