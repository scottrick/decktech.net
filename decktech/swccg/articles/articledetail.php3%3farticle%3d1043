What I'm trying to say is that it can work, if you put enough tricks into it to keep your opponent guessing till you set it up, and beyond.  I suggest you rate me for how well I illuminate, not for how well the card does.<br>
<br>
There are several different ways to play EBO, and I'll break it down.	We'll cover each main objective of each deck, then cards and strategies that facilitate the establishment of EBO, then cards that protect it, generally.<br>
<br>
I. All Things EBO<br>
II.  Straight EBO<br>
III. EBO Numbers<br>
IV. EBO Hidden Base<br>
V. EBO Delay<br>
VI. Speedups<br>
VII. Avoidance of Death<br>
VIII. Conclusions<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I.  All Things EBO<br>
<br>
Most EBO decks share some common characteristics.  They are:<br>
<br>
X-WINGS-<br>
<br>
The whole point of EBO is the cheap deploy and big force drains afforded by the effect.  Using a Super	Falcon, a bunch of Corvettes, and the Leaders hardly optimizes the cheap deploy, and forces you to concentrate on a couple of systems with your big fellows, instead of spreading out and draining.  Therefor, the best tactic is large numbers of X-wings, enhanced with Incom Corporations, maybe Organized Attack, and maybe S-foils.  Organized Attack might take up too much space to be worth the one extra power per starfighter and the added durability, and S-foils keeps you from Hyper Escaping.  Incom doesn't have anything bad attached to it (it'll only take one card, plus The Signals, which you'd use, anyway).	I've seen some people use Y-wings and Y-wing Assault Squads instead, but it hardly works, because once you've placed the Effect on table, you'll have a hard time using all your force (all those systems give you icons), and the squadrons are about as powerful as a single X-wing.<br>
<br>
MPG START-<br>
<br>
Unless you're playing Hidden Base, this is the way to start.  War Room doesn't work anymore, plain and simple.  Either Mara comes down first or second turn, or Vader comes down with a Presence Of The Force.  Either way, it's not too pretty.  Ice Storm can't touch anyone in the War Room.<br>
<br>
INSURRECTION START:<br>
<br>
Yeah, other effects are helpful, but it is better to do this than stick two more sites into your deck.	With this, only two more sites will have to come out (or three if you're playing HB).	If you need to get out that important effect, then stuff in another Signal or two.<br>
<br>
<br>
II. Straight EBO<br>
<br>
In this type of deck, you set up EBO, nothing fancy. Then you start draining.  To be perfectly blunt and objective, this deck loses to good decks about 75% of the time.  At least.  The whole point of doing this sort of deck instead of lolli-gagging around with HB or Numbers is because it will go a bit faster, but you're going to always end up short of X-wings, sites, or systems.	To give it a bit of credit, go see number 5, EBO Delay, which is separate because it incorporates several elements covered.  However fast you go, your opponent will be there a step ahead of you, most likely, so consider the options below before you go off to build a straight EBO deck to prove me wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
III. EBO Numbers<br>
<br>
The principle here is that while you set up EBO, you control the sites with high destiny characters.  You can control the docking bay with an X-wing, and then play Wioslea, Wedge Antilles, and Artoo, for a destiny of sixteen on table.  That way, you can plop down the effect without screwing up your destiny.  In this way, you can do some serious damage early on while this deck sets up, almost keeping pace with the drains your opponent has been pulling off at the same time.  The problem is that Wioslea and Wedge are the only characters with ability and destiny five, so you'll have to pack multiples of them.  Using these cards can slow down EBO considerably, though, and if they're packing two Tortures, then this strategy becomes a bit worthless.  Considering the ease at which it becomes hosed, this isn't the strongest alternative, either.  However, it is something to consider, and can be pretty fun.  Just because they have two tortures doesn't mean they'll get one before the card comes up, either.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV. HB EBO<br>
<br>
Oooooh, I love this concept.  From the systems deployed, you get a ton of icons, which allows you to use the speedups (Electrobinoculars and Hiding In The Garbage, namely).  Also, this gives you a sure way of getting out the systems, so all you have left to get are the sites, the characters, and the X-wings.  This will also force your opponent to come to you in space (they can't win a drain race if two of their drains are blocked, and a third from Rebel Fleet).  Probing won't hurt you too much, especially if you pack an It Could Be Worse, and have the Electros to get at it.	Against Bounty Hunter ships, which is what you'll be playing against if they use some space protection, use the Electros to get high destinies and zap them with Laser Cannons.  This works well even against Security Precautions.  I say use the Electros because you're going to have them in your deck so you might as well use them for all they're worth, which is a lot and can help you with this sort of deck.  The problem with this deck is that you'll have to stock Main Power Generators, too, which means even more locations in your deck, but it'll balance out when you get all your systems out with Hidden Base.  It does slow down EBO a little bit, but you wont need to play it down till turn five, anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
V.  EBO Delay<br>
<br>
The concept here is that if you can block two of their drains before you get EBO out every turn, then you stand a much better chance of winning.  Playing with Entrenchment and Rebel Fleet (there's simply not going to be enough space for Bargaining Table, too), you occupy the sites with Echo Base Troopers, and use a couple more troopers than usual.	Notice that you'll have a destiny of nine on table, which is suitable for using Never Tell Me The Odds as well as giving you protection from your opponent's odds.  This is why I suggest always using Echo Base Troopers in the Speedups section.  Or, you can use Crix Madine and a bunch of Dresselian Commandos and Rebel Scouts. This way, you can cancel your opponent's drain assuredly every turn because you have plenty of X-wings and Madine lets you dig for a rebel to your hand.  However, either way, you'll have to beware of Alter, and Grabbers with Wise Advice and Do, Or Do Not is simply too slow.  They'll be draining while you're digging for the card back.  This can be hosed easily, too, by some SAC, so I really recommend HB EBO.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.  Speedups<br>
<br>
Rapid Deployment:<br>
Use two of these, and three or four Echo Base Troopers.  Play an X-wing to the Docking Bay, and then next turn use the Rapid Deployment to get out your troopers.  It's more efficient than using five or six troopers, because you can simply Electro for the Rapid Deployment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hiding In The Garbage:<br>
A very efficient way to get your X-wings after you play EBO.  You'll have plenty of extra force, so that won't be a problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Electobinoculars:<br>
Outshines Hiding; you can use it for a far more numerous amount of things.  Put in this before you put Hiding into your deck.  It'll let you dig for sites, It Could Be Worse, good destinies against bounty hunters, etc. etc., without getting a huge hand thatll get monnoked.<br>
<br>
<br>
How Did We Get Into This Mess?:<br>
It doesn't work as well as people say it does.  Trust me.  It takes up about ten cards in your deck, but does allow you to get out EBO more easily.  It's best to use it with EBO numbers because you'll already be packing at least two Artoos.  So you're down to eight cards it takes up, then remember you won't have to use duplicates of sites or use Insurrection, so you're down to about three cards it takes up.  If used in combination with Electros, you can efficiently get everything you'll need.  Watch out for the grabbers, though.  A good combo is this and Surprise Assault.  Use this, putting Surprise Assault either in a Cyborg thing (I forgot the name) or simply drawing one later.  Put all your high destinies in a bunch, and track them.  When they reach the top, Surprise Assault, and your destinies will  be extreme.<br>
<br>
<br>
Recoil In Fear:<br>
Might as well pack one or two, at least.  It doesn't take too much card space, and you don't have to worry about it getting grabbed as much, and it disrupts your opponent.  It lets you get new cards, but it isn't as efficient as HDWGITM and is a lost interrupt that costs three force and has a worse destiny.  There's pros and cons to everything, but this works well for the space.<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.  Avoidance of Death<br>
<br>
EPP Hit Squad:<br>
Yeah, you say, 'This is an EBO deck!' but think about it.  They will try to spread out on Hoth and cancel EBO.  If they get past the Ice Storm with a Walker, then they leave themselves wide open for the Hit Squad.  You can get its members easily with Electrobinoculars (I love that card more and more with each passing day), and then lay a smackdown.  It gives your deck a bit more of flexiblity, too, protecting you a bit from Battle Order.  EBO is pretty rigid, so the more flexibility you can give it, the better.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ice Storm:<br>
No one comes in unless it's a Walker.	This protects you for three turns, as well as keeps ISB off your back a little bit.  Pack two.	Your opponent will probably start moving in after the first one abates.<br>
<br>
<br>
X-wing Laser Cannons:<br>
Protects you from that evil Zuckuss thing, and all Court decks in general.  Watch out for Overload, but it won't happen too often.  Also, you can use a Power Pivot with it, which is cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rebel Fleet:<br>
You have X-wings.  Tons of them.  Throw in this.  It'll save you some force (at least eight, if you stop four drains).  Thats like a lost interrupt that says 'Retrieve eight force'.  Use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hyper Escape:<br>
Very nice little card that lets you sit at systems with one X-wing.  This is also good for a rebound battleyou and your opponent are contesting two systems.  Initiate one, Hyper Escape away from it to the other, and then initiate a battle there with the newly arrived starships.	However, you can't be using S-foils at the same time.	And, if you don't mind losing an X-wing, you'd probably be better off with X-wings instead of Hyper Escapes.	Think about it.  Your X-wing has six power (+1 from Incom, +2 from foils), gains +3 from EBO, and has a forfeit of four.  So unless your opponent puts 14 or more power at the system, no damage goes to you.  You just lose an X-wing.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Wings Report In:<br>
Take out an X-wing, put in this.  It'll let you get an X-wing, gives you retrieval, and is a good destiny to track.  'Nuff said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alternatives To Fighting:<br>
A good way to get rid of an APTW your opponent has in their hand for their TIEs.  They have to do their 'just' action first, so if they do play it, play Alternatives.  If they don't, you pass your 'just' action, too, and no more APTW for that battle.  However, the main purpose of this is to save you an X-wing while still being able to use S-foils.  If you save X-wings up in your hand, then when they plop down, smack your opponent in return.  Using one or two is okay, I guess, but think if having one or two more X-wing in your deck will serve you better before you put them in.<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.  Conclusions<br>
<br>
Here ends my long analysis of EBO.  I thank you for reading and hope that it has been illuminating.  I know it has been at least a bit better than the garbage that has been posted in the past weeks.	I know I forgot a couple things; please say them in your review so that, while my article won't be complete, the information will be, so that everyone who reads will have those suggestions.	Also, I haven't yet said EBO ruled; rate me at the accuracy and the illuminacy of my statements.  Finally, I apologize for any stray characters (I imported from Word, and I tried to clean it up, but I know I skipped a few.)  GL HF 'nuff said.<br>
