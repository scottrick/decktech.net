Ah I love seeing that card on my side of the table.  Force retrieval is great as it directly helps you in the race to kill your opponents deck.  Direct damage is just like that only better because it will let you win games instead of merely not losing.  Winning is much better than not losing because not losing requires a second strategy (damage prevention and some damage dealing).  Don't get me wrong and I love force retrieval but force loss causes your opponent to hurry alot more than retrieval.	Oh and by the way, Secret Plans and Battle Order doesn't have an equivalent for direct damage.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to do everything (like Transmission Terminated, I'm just going to hit the major ones)<br>
<br>
Suprise Assault- This was the first card that directly canceled force drains and it was the first card that could cause major force loss all on its own.  Rig your destiny and everything besides Vader/Tarkin and Star Destroyers was unavailable to drain in the days of old.  This was best used by the Death Star Plans deck (nabrun and massive retrieval of D* Plans, later inserts).  Now, most deck that use suprise assault are hangovers of that deck (with RtP) and testing to 5.  if you draw a 7 every time, you'll do much damage against almost every deck.<br>
<br>
Anger, Fear Aggression-  when massive drains were hard to come by (like before JP/ETE), AFA was a good deal for non-interactive decks.	They lose 4 cards, you lose 1.	Good deal, but it take too much time in today's enviroment.  A Hit and run mains deck could use this to some effect if they could slow the game down.	This is defferent from OtE because the battle only has to be initiated (sorry Arconas).  for an insert, 4 damage isn't as good as the next card.  However, it is cool to start with it.<br>
<br>
Never Tell Me the Odds- the lore on this is is inferior to it's DS counterpart's text, but it's so much better in play ability.  Until JP, numbers protection was situational and numbers ruled the game.  Now there are so many great high destiny characters and most still have some use.  Artoo is a spy and can pull A Gift from reserve, Wioslea can buy droids (except Iggy) and empty walkers (use this schmuk instead of R-3PO).  Wedge is all around a solid character, 8D8 can free captives, Eloms are non-unique aliens and are good agaisnt ROps.  All good stuff.  When you put only three characters on the table, you can easily have a total of 12 (almost automatic when playing with all eloms) and that is 9 force loss against your mains playing opponent (with destiny 1 characters).  With Torture, Vesden, and Resistance, you need another good source of damage but a quick force loss of 8 or more puts pressure on your opponent.  More dangerous than AFA, but this requires a special deck.<br>
<br>
Order to Engage- Clint Hays called this the best LS card (he's wrong, Revo is) but nonetheless this is an amazing card.  There are many ways to play with this.  You can use cards that create presence but avoid battles.  Arcona, It's a Trap, Narrow escape, Hyper escape, Gimer stick, the list goes on.	This is the most common way to use this as it can wreck any opponent that tries to drain.  Another way to use this card to setup amazing defensive interupts.  Usually used with the Falcon, interupts liek Punch It, Out of Nowhere, Gambler's Luck, and We can still out Manuver Them (who uses this card?) and You Overestimate their chances to gain a massive edge in battles (note that all fo these work with a lone Lando in Falcon).	A good way to entice the DS into battling, just watch out for First strike.  The final way to use this card is to find a weak spot, put a huge force there (like all 4 EPP's with adders) and Barrier everything that tires to reinforce it.  This is effective but not that good because the DS can usually battle you off after a while with their superior characters.  Watch out for Point Man and have SAC protection (not Do Or Do Not) and Effective Repairs.  Potentaily a game swinger in a mains deck, so make sure you have it on the table.<br>
<br>
No Disintegrations!- initially this card looks amazing but at second look, it solid but not unbelivable.  Everyone uses Vader, so target him with your EPP's (which die because they have no immunity, triggering the effect) and they forfeit their hunter to attrition, thus they avoid having to lose another hunter.  But the 3 force loss is still a good thing.	every HB mains deck that abuses Tibrin needs this because it allows you to recycle mains at little cost.  Bacta Tank is great because you don't really lose the character and this still triggers.  However, the only hunters that are common are Fett, 4-Lom, and Dengar. (Iggy captures the character).  Still a good card.<br>
<br>
Uncontrollable Fury- this + scramble on the table the whole game usually gives you the ground.	It's not hard to get an ability 4 character on the table (auto with MWYHL, difficult with Hunt Down), and you can have that 2 force loss every turn.  Breaking up Vader/Tarkin isn't as important because you don't want Vader to be lost.  It's not the counter to Hunt Down everyone thinks it is because Visage counteracts the damage and the frount side of Hunt Down allows Uncle Fury to leave play.  However, you don't have to worry about Vader draining if you can go elsewhere and slap this on the bad boy.  This card is amazing with Scramble because you can battle off the few non-pilots (like Jabba), Avoid Vader, and then you won't have to worry about too many battle destinies.<br>
<br>
Civil Disorder-  this was suposedly the first numbers counter (most numbers decks were droid decks) although it was weak at that.  However, with Oola, this card becomes a machine in Throne Room decks.  Oola + Grimtaash + huge activation advantage can keep the DS free from non-Mara characters ans then Civil Disorder can cause damage without giving away icons.<br>
<br>
I Hope she's all right- crushes non-interactive DS decks, of which there are none.  You have to have a good trick to get this to work.<br>
<br>
Profit flipside- ok, you lose force if I have my heavy hitters at battlegrounds, encourages battle which encourages killing Han, which forces reflip which means you can't drain with those mains of Tatooine.  Profit sucks unless you get sweet protection around han.  In other words, Profit sucks.  Although the direct damage is amazing, it's too risky.  BoShuda kind of takes away the amazing power of EPP Han which fuels the decks' efficency.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the DS can't cancel direct damage like they can with Den of Thieves or Ghhk.  Direct damage is sweet but you have to style your deck around your direct damage cards.<br>
<br>
To Clint Hays:	you suck for giving me a one star rating.  I know it will happen so I'll just tell you in advance. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
