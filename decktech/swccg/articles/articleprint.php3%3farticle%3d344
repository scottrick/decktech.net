It was spring 1997.  Hoth had been released a few months previously providing a new creature as well as the only creature enhancing cards available: Frozen Dinner and Yaggle Gakkle.  However, the Wampa was a poor creature and the cards were basically ignored, save for the occasion theme deck.<br>
All this changed with the introduction of Dagobah.  While many wondered about the new bounty hunters and their ships, the powerful Executor, the idea of these new 'Insert' cards, or the thought of Jedi Testing, there was a secret monster within the set which threatened the future of the game itself.	It was the lowly Mynock.  By all appearances underpowered, many failed to recognize its true potency.  And yet, it would be the center of a deck so feared and hated that few to this day can recall it, having chosen to wipe their memory of its horror.<br>
Mynock<br>
Deploy:3 Ferocity:2 Defense:3<br>
Habitat: unrestricted<br>
May move like a starfighter. If starfighter present, instead of attacking, randomly attaches to cumulatively reduce power and hyperspeed by 2 (detaches only when both &lt; 1).<br>
<br>
A creature with no restrictions for habitat?  Shocking to some, but not as much as the fact that these creatures were 'selective', that is, they would not attack each other.  The threat of Mynock swarms offered a terror of its own, until the onset of Creature Madness.	Here's one of the last surviving decklists of Creature Madness:<br>

<br>
The terrifying deck took advantage of the wording of Frozen Dinner: that it may deploy on ANY character alone at the Wampa Cave.  The deck was so constructed that the player should be able to deploy a character, Frozen Dinner, and a Mynock at the Wampa Cave, killing and eating them before your opponent even had a turn and giving your Mynock ferocity of 4.  After that you had the option of either feeding another helpless trooper at the cave or putting Banthas outside and using the Yaggle Gakkle.  Within a few turns the Mynock would have a Ferocity of 14 or higher, and that was when trouble started as the monster was able to travel anywhere due to its unrestricted nature.	Echo Base Ops were hardest hit, as the Mynocks swooped in and gobbled up their support crews.  For other planets, a TIE Scout would carry the Mynocks to the planet to feast on the unwary rebels and aliens that dwelt there.	And while the Mynocks terrorized on the ground the Star Destroyers of the Empire ruled the stars.  The addition of Red Leader in Red 1 and Gold Leader in Gold 1 helped some, but with Mynocks crippling them, the ships were soon unable to stop the Imperial fleets advances.<br>
With the unstoppable Mynocks everywhere decks quickly tried to find a way to adapt.  Attempts to Control the Frozen Dinner was met with some success, but it just wasn't reliable enough against the first turn monster Mynock.  Sensing the Yaggle Gakkles helped some, but with the onset of Controls and Do or Do Not this merely slowed the inevitable.  Some completely changed decks, creating what became known as Asteroid Sanctuary and Numbers, decks safe from the terrifying Mynocks.<br>
Finally, facing outrage from the gaming community, Decipher issued the ruling: Frozen Dinner must target your OPPONENT'S character, not your own.  This was agreed upon by all as the best solution, keeping the spirit of the card and yet still bringing balance to the tournament environment.  And yet Creature Menace left its mark; it's nemesis Asteroid Sanctuary and Never Tell Me The Odds began dominating, forcing future cards to limit their effectiveness.  But Decipher had learned; never again would it create a card to increase ferrocity.<br>
<br>
<br>
The above is absolutely untrue.  There is no Creature Madness deck (not that it really matters, it probably wouldn't do all that well anyway).  In fact, the only truth at all in the above is the errata on Frozen Dinner: it must target your opponent's character, not your own.  You're no doubt wondering why I went to all that trouble and wasted so much space; well the reason is simple: to make you aware of this errata.<br>
<br>
'Great, you could've just come out and said it.'  Yes, I could've done that, but I wanted to illustrate a point.  We hear these kinds of stories and remember them.  Ops, Hidden Base, Maelstrom, even Floating Refineries have all got this 'legend' about them, and we all remember: these cards were broken, and were errata'd.  But for every Operative, there's a Frozen Dinner, for every Droid Merchant, there's a Crash Landing.<br>
<br>
Think for a second; did you know, before you read this article, that Frozen Dinner had been errata'd?	You probably knew that it was supposed to go on your opponent's character, right?  Read the card though, it doesn't specify this limitation; hence the errata.  Many people base what they know of the card on the gametext, and with good reason: it's usually right.  However, that's not always the case, and a close game can be won or lost by a piece of errata that's been ignored.  Granted, the above story is a bit of an extreme, but let's say that your opponent did Frozen Dinner their own character in a game: there are strategic uses for doing it.  A Wampa who's had a Frozen Dinner is now at the same power level as Son of Skywalker: 5+destiny.	This can be a gamebreaking difference, and if you don't know that targeting your opponent's snowtrooper isn't an option, it hurts your own chances.	Remember, there are dozens of cards that have been errata'd, and if you don't know what they are, it can be the difference between a win and a loss.<br>
<br>
My point is that you have to be aware of the rulings - that is simply a must today.  You need to get out there and do some research so you're ready for what you might face.  The Glossary is a great start.  Bring it with you to your games.  Copy rulings that may be important in it, or write it on an index card (print it off, clip it out, and glue it to the card if you like) and insert it in the book so you always have it with you.  Especially get the exact wordings for cards that are going to be popular: Hidden Base, Operatives, Droid Merchant for certain.  Maybe some of the lesser known yet deadly combos: Special Delivery and  Floating Refinery.<br>
<br>
Look at EPPs; it's essential to know how exactly they work.  Are they targetable by Overload?	Yes, but it only has an effect if you draw a 0.  What about Bane Malar?  Copies it, but can't use the weapon.	You should be aware of every ruling involving these cards, because you will face them.	For example, I target your Luke with Lightsaber with Wounded Wookie, canceling his gametext.  He can't hit anyone with his lightsaber now, we all know that, but he still has the weapon!  Remember, there are cards that target a character with a lightsaber, and the fact that he still has it can mean the difference between victory and defeat (a bonus to Under Attack, or the extra points for your Epic Duel).  But if you didn't know this part of the ruling, this information is completely useless to you.<br>
<br>
There are many pieces of information given for before a tournament or major game, but perhaps the most important is this: know the rules.  Seems obvious.  And yet, look at some of the remarks you see or actions people perform.  I heard a suggestion that you can put Lando in an AT-AT at the Casino to protect him from weapons fire.  This is true, and yes, he can still play Cloud City Sabacc (he's on Cloud City, after all).  But he retrieves no force because he has no presence.  These kinds of mistakes can be devestating if you show up at a tournament with an illeagal deck concept.  That's why before you even start playtesting, check the rulings and make sure you're not making a mistake.  Don't be afraid to ask others if you're not sure, even the best players ask one another for interpretations of cards.  You don't have to be a rules lawyer, but you do need to understand the rules.<br>
<br>
Always remember that it's going to be hard enough when it's you versus your opponent; so don't give them any extra help in defeating you.  By this I mean to keep your eyes open, not for cheating, but for mistakes (his and yours).  Did your opponent pay the extra force for Bad Feeling Have I?  The extra one to battle for Wars Not Make One Great?  These small amounts can make a big deal in the game; after all, that's why you've included them.  You don't need to be a jerk about it, but just remind them 'Fett deploys for 7, Goo Nee Ta is out.'  Most players will apologize for the mistake and correct it, and the rest, well, there's just no dealing with some people.  Also, you need to be aware of yourself and your actions.  One forgotten force drain can be the difference between victory and defeat.  One of the easiest ways to mess up is if your opponent does something during your turn, so here's what I do: put a coin in a position that will remind you of what it's there for, kind of a variant on the old tie-a-string-round-your-finger bit.  For example, you finishing activating and your opponent plays Sabacc; put a coin on your force pile and play Sabacc.  When you're done, before you go to deploy a card, you'll see the coin and remember 'Control phase, I've gotta force drain'.  Like I said before, your opponent is already working to beat you, you don't need to help him out by making mistakes.<br>
<br>
If you're concerned about your mistakes, here's another trick: bring some kind of marker, like some tokens or some dice, and every time you make a mistake in the game, note it (green for force drains, white for deployment, whatever works), and at the end of the game, check where your most common mistakes are so you can work on avoiding them for the next game.  It takes honesty on your part; don't ignore mistakes even though they didn't necessarily hurt you.  Remember the old saying: the first step in finding a cure is admitting you have a problem.  By recognizing it, it because easier to avoid.<br>
<br>
Does this mean the game must become oh so serious?  Absolutely not.  Enjoy the game, and especially enjoy the fact that it's you're best possible game, because you know what you're doing and are thoroughly prepared.  Bon apetite.<br>
