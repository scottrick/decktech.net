Penalties exist to protect players from potential misconduct. All penalties in this document assume that the infraction is unintentional. If any judge believes that an infraction was intentional, the penalty will be upgraded. If the judge believes that the situation has significant, extenuating circumstances, he or she is free to modify the penalty as appropriate (with approval of the Head Judge).<br>

Below are most of the definitions in which players will be disciplined for infractions occuring during the tournament.	All of these below will apply to the Mega Tournament and for the SW Grand Slam.  All or some of these will also apply to each of the other tournaments, please be sure that the judge announces whether or not he/she will be using these rules or not.<br>
<br>
Definitions<br>
<br>
Below are definitions of various penalties that players may be given for rules infractions...<br>
<br>
 - Warning - this is a verbal warning from the Head Judge, it is than recorded on the penalized player&#146;s 3x5 register card.  If a player gets a third Warning it will result in a Game Loss.<br>
<br>
 - Game Loss - A more serious type of penalty.	This will be enforced on the player&#146;s next game (of if it is a deck penalty, than it will be enforced when the player plays that side next).  This penalty results in a Full Loss by a differential of -30 force.	The penalized player will then get a Full Win by a differential of +30.  If this occurs during the last game of the tournament (or last game with a specific deck on a one side of the force) than the penalized player will immediately forfeit the current game and the results will be given as a Full Loss by a differential of -30.<br>
<br>
 - Game Loss, Major - Since we are trying to shy away from disqualifying anyone, this is probably the harshest penalty a player can get.  This will result in a Full Loss by a differential of -45 in the game that the player is currently playing in (the opposing player will have a Full Win by a differential of +45).  If the player continues with unsportsmanlike behavior after the penalty has been given, then that player&#146;s next game will have the following result.<br>
<br>
Please note that the Head Judge has the final decision and may choose to change any one of these penalties to fit the severeness of the infraction.  The penalties will also be made public for statistical tracking purposes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deck Problems<br>
<br>
The following is a list of possible deck problems that might occur before/during/after the tournament.	Please read carefully because there will be a &#146;no tolerance&#146; attitude taken in respect to each of these problems.  Any deck that has not been changed correctly after the initial check (if the player received a penalty for an infraction) than the penalty will be escalated. The Head Judge reserves the right to give any form of penalty if he/she believes that &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that a player is violating any rules that are not listed above.	Listed first is the infraction, then the penalty.<br>
