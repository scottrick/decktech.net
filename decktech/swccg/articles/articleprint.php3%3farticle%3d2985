This article is not intended to insult Brian Hunter.  It is the 3rd part in a ficticous story about Hunter.  Read the other 2 parts before you read this.  I realize that this has nothing to do with strategy but I don&#146;t care.  If you are looking at articles only to improve your game, this is not for you.  Otherwise, read on.<br>

<br>
Part III &#146;Tis the Season<br>
<br>
&quot;Driving from Arizona to Colorado is like walking through a burning building and reaching a wampa cave on the other side,&quot; Tyler D tells me as we drive through the Rockies.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Brian Hunter is the wampa,&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
&quot;oooo, can I be Commander Luke?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you&#146;re a tantaun.&quot;<br>
<br>
We&#146;ve been driving for like 15 hours.  So far, we&#146;ve done a good job of staying a good distance away from Hunter while still heading in the right direction.<br>
<br>
To Hunter, we&#146;re the car that you see on a roadtrip maybe every hour or so but is never right behind you.  <br>
<br>
Nothing is out of the ordinary.<br>
<br>
Other than the fact that we&#146;re following a wampa through several states in order to find out whether or not he is actually posessed by a demonic creature of Hell, this is completely normal.<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve got the map and Tyler&#146;s driving at about 90.  We haven&#146;t seen Hunter for about 2 hours and I&#146;m starting to get worried.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe we passed him,&quot; Tyler says.<br>
<br>
&quot;I doubt that.  This is Colorado.  There haven&#146;t been more than 5 cars on the road at a time.  We would have seen him.  Theres only so many 1980 Ford Pintos with dented bumpers driving around.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe he pulled over to a rest stop or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jesus doesn&#146;t piss.  You know that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tired and frustrated, I decided to catch some shut-eye.  It wasn&#146;t long before I was awakened by a startling image.<br>
<br>
An exit sign partially destroyed and burning.  Letters were missing.  The sign read:<br>
<br>
D  ver  al<br>
E it Ri<br>
<br>
&quot;What the @#$%?!?!&quot;  I usually wake up saying this these days.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I just received a sign.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From who, HUNTER?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No The @#$%in trix rabbit, yes Hunter!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don&#146;t know, it looked like a burning.....&quot;   Overhead I see a rectangular exit sign.  <br>
<br>
&quot;STOP THE CAR!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
We come to a screeching hault and back up.<br>
<br>
Denver Mall<br>
Exit Right<br>
<br>
&quot;Get off here,&quot; I command.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dude, now is not the time for consumerism.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We&#146;re not consumers.  We&#146;re observers.&quot;<br>
<br>
We turn right and enter the mall parking lot.  Right in front of the mall, what do we see but Brian Hunter&#146;s 1980 Ford Pinto with the dented bumper. <br>
<br>
We run into the mall.  From the looks of it, a crowd of people has formed in front of the Kay-Bee Toy Store.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, what the hell is going on in there?&quot;  I ask a member of the crowd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some guy started tearing up the store and shooting at customers with toy guns. Then when the employees went after them he began fighting them all at once.  It looks like he&#146;s winning too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Holy @#$%, he&#146;s lost it,&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
Tyler D turns to me.  &quot;If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?&quot;  (Gratuitous FC reference #2)<br>
<br>
I pick up one of the nickelodeon toys scattered in front of me.  &quot;Spunge Bob of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Booyah!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
A man flies over the heads of every member of the crowd.  He lands in the nearby fountain.  <br>
<br>
A scream comes from inside the store.  &quot;Run infidels, run for your miserable worthless lives!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd disperses and runs out the door.  Hunter comes running out behind them!!!  He runs down the hall of the complex, makes a left turn at a corridor and charges towards the Christmas area.  Tyler and I follow in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you want for Chistmas son,&quot; asks the fat man.  <br>
<br>
Hunter runs up to Santa.  His turn is next.  You can tell he&#146;s ready.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a gun Santa,&quot; the kid currently sitting on his lap says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well let&#146;s see what Santa can do.&quot;  Santa reaches his fat red arm into his fat red sack and pulls out a huge rifle.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, they sure are pretty loose on gun laws down here.&quot;<br>
<br>
The kid runs to his parents with his new gift and Hunter leaps on Santa&#146;s lap.  <br>
<br>
&quot;er...uh...and what would you like for Christmas young man?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MOTHA@#$%A, I WANT A BLADE!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT THE @#$% DID YOU SAY TO ME MOTHER@#$%ER&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no.&quot;  I drop my head into my hands but I can&#146;t bring myself to look away completely.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see Hunter snapmare Santa of his chair and then perform a leg drop on him.  Hunter then drags Santa towards the gardening store.  <br>
<br>
&quot;aaaah, what are you doing,&quot; shouts the fat man.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is for the cole you gave me when I was 8 Santa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#146;m not really Santa @#$%.  I work at the steel factory.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Nice try fatty.&quot;  Hunter tosses Santa into a heap of fertilizer bags and pulls out a lighter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Say goodbye to misses Claus.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hunter kicks claus, in the stomach and tosses the lighter into the heap of fertilizer. <br>
<br>
I&#146;ve never ran faster in my life then I ran away from the inevitable blast.  I always hated watching Sylvester Stallon run out of some burning buiding and leap into the air right before the explosion but in all seriousness, that is exactly what Tyler and I did.<br>
<br>
We got in the car and drove off as fast as possible leaving behind a burning mass of Christmas shopping season.  <br>
<br>
Flaming Tickle Me Elmo<br>
Charred Playstation 2<br>
<br>
All prices marked down to 0!!!  Everything must go!!!<br>
<br>
Hunter&#146;s car wasn&#146;t in the parking lot, so I assumed he made it out.  We drove down the highway at maximum speed.  We were after Brian Hunter...not just out of curiosity.  There was no longer a doubt in my mind that Brian Hunter was posessed.  No, it was now our mission to stop him before he killed again.  <br>
