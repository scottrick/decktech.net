I have used Ewok decks successfully in tournaments, and ever looking for the best conception of the deck.  I started out with a straight Ewok deck (The Ewok Drain; go to my DeckTech page to see it), using Careful Planning to give Endor a Farm and a Jungle along with Chirpa&#146;s Hut (later changed to Rebel Landing Site).  Then I moved on to a Profit design (Why Ewoks Care About Hansicles; go to my DeckTech page to see it), which made the deck better.  Now, I have moved them from Profiting to being Agents (Unlikely Court Members; go to my DeckTech page to see it).  This conception so far has the most potential, and has proven to be a good design in playtesting (using proxies to represent the JPSD cards not released yet).<br>
Jumping on this Agents bandwagon, I&#146;ve seen (and reviewed) many decks of this nature.  The repetition of my comments drove me to the conclusion that no one that has reviewed these decks truly know what the Ewoks do.  I&#146;ve seen people slam and forsake the best Ewoks, and tout the lesser ones as gods.	Here I present to you, as a veteran Ewok player, a complete list of all the Ewok characters and how best to utilize them.  After the list is a view on how to best play Ewoks.<br>
<br>
Kazak - He is by far the best Ewok in an Ewok deck.  He boosts your drains where Ewoks are on Endor by one, hence becoming a target for the DS.  His destiny of 3 makes him a worthwhile duplication in decks, and has ability of 2.<br>
Graak - Him combined with Kazak makes the DS very worried.  He makes them lose Force drains from Reserve at his site and adjacent sites, becoming a second target for the DS.  Another destiny 3 Ewok, but unfortunately has only ability of 1.<br>
Wicket - He works his magic best in battle.  He has the potential to exclude a DS character.  This comes in handy.  He has the power base of a Spearman, is a scout, and is ability 2.<br>
Logray - Battle destiny +1 at Endor sites with an Ewok.  Ability 2, destiny 3, musician.<br>
Teebo - Makes all your Ewoks forfeit +1 (+2 when with Logray).	With him, you won&#146;t have to sack so many Ewoks when hit with high DS battle destiny.  Ability 1, destiny 3, musician, power base of a Spearman.<br>
Wuta - Pull sites.  Good deal.	Ability 2, destiny 3, scout, deploys free from Reserve with Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk.<br>
Romba - Generation +1 at Endor sites with an Ewok.  This helps mostly when you&#146;re not packing many locations.  Ability 1, destiny 3, scout.<br>
Chief Chirpa - Pulls non-unique Ewoks.	Not all that great considering the best way to play Ewoks.  Ability 2, destiny 2, leader.<br>
Lumat - +1 to weapon destinies at Endor sites where you have an Ewok.  This works with ALL weapons, not just Ewok weapons.  Ability 1, destiny 3, deploys free from Reserve with Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk.<br>
Paploo - Scout, speeder bike pilot, and can pull a decent Used 5 interrupt.  Not all that bad.	Ability 2, destiny 3, scout and thief.<br>
Rabin - Bonuses when fighting creatures.  Not all that exciting, but definitely provides a challenge against an invading Bubo.	Ability 1, destiny 3, thief.<br>
Ewok Tribesman - these are the worst non-unique Ewoks.	They absorb all attrition when with a unique Ewok, but aren&#146;t all that powerful for their 2 deploy.<br>
Ewok Sentry - the second-best non-unique Ewoks.  They only work well when coupled with unique Ewoks because of their reacting capability.  They are scouts too, which is beneficial with such interrupts as Insertion Planning, etc.<br>
Ewok Spearman - the best non-unique Ewoks.  Two of them at an Endor site and you get battle destiny.  If you&#146;re packing Ewok Spears, they&#146;re free on these bad boys.	They also start off with a power 1, and with their power/forfeit gametext, they become overpowering en masse against DS assaults.  Simply use Ewok Rescue to move them to where they&#146;re needed.<br>
<br>
In your basic Ewok deck, Spearmen are the way to go.  Their gametext gets you off to a quick start on Endor.  Later in the game, when you have spread out a bit, and your opponent comes after you, Ewok Rescue and Sound The Attack boost your power quite high, and if you&#146;ve got Threepio there, your opponent will have to clear the site.  As you see, the true power of the Ewoks lies in numbers.  Having some of them stored on a Bargaining Table and/or in your hand gives you a nasty little surprise on your opponent once they make the mistake of setting foot on Endor soil.  With the added bonuses of Tessek at the Audience Chamber, Ithorians, and Kazak, not only can you crank your Spearmen out faster, but your drains will skyrocket to 4 at normally 2-1 sites and 5 at the Back Door.<br>
Another field in your basic Ewok deck is the other types of characters involved in the deck.  Obviously, Tessek and Ithorians are the prime alien ingredients.	Daughter Of Skywalker is another prime choice.	Her addition of a LS icon boost Ewok power.  When armed with a lightsaber, she is the perfect defender.  Threepio is also another must for Ewok decks.	He adds 1 to your opponent&#146;s attrition for every Ewok at same site; the only DS character whom can stand that bonus is the Emperor.  Also, you can forfeit him to Used Pile at the end of battle.	With Seeking An Audience, Threepio can keep coming back every turn when needed.<br>
Starting off with this character base, you can making a viable Ewok deck; just don&#146;t forget any of the key red cards that will be beneficial.  Also, when playing with Ewoks, always remember to never stray from your goal.  Getting sidetracked by packing many mains and going off-Endor can be costly and will slow down your ability to drain your opponent out.<br>
I hope this article has given you insight on how to play Ewoks well and not to misjudge (and overjudge) some Ewok cards.<br>
