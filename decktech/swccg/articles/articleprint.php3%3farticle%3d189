Dark Side was back and in control. This can sorta be considered a review for all the Dark Side ECC cards. I'm gonna go with the most important one in my opinion and work my way down.<br>
<br>
CRUSH THE REBELLION !<br>
<br>
Here's the gametext for the people who don't have it ( I pity you ). Destiny 4 Effect. Deploy on Table. Once per turn , may take I Have You Now or Evader into hand from Reserve Deck ; reshuffle. At mobile sites , opponent draws no more than two battle destinies per battle. Evader is immune to Sense. May lose 1 Force to cancel Clash of Sabers. ( Immune to Alter ) .<br>
<br>
Okay I'm gonna try to make this sound different then the card review Juz put up so here we go. First off it lets you get Evader which puts a crimp into Revolution. As a side effect you can also get I Have You Now to battle more effectively with Vader. Don't have to wory about Clash of Sabers and is basically a Wounded Wookiee at Mobile sites. I'm gonna say how this has affected the game , at least in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Clash of Sabers ( Vader ) was the ultimate beatdown card for the Lightside. You remove a Power 6 Forfeit 8 character that adds a destiny and he's usually with Tarkin so that means you'd lose a destiny. You just swung 14 points of battle stuff plus knocked out the ability to cancel a destiny , draw a destiny , choke a character , or nail someone with a Lightsaber. That is huge !! Tarkin would get beatup for something at least in the teens and that'd basically be the end of the game. You could figure this as a difference of 14 ( Vader's Power and Forfeit ) + X ( opponent's destiny he would've gotten + Y ( destiny you would've lost when Tarkin cancels your destiny ) + Z ( Power/Forfeit  of character Vader would've choked , hacked , or 1 if it is just Premiere Vader w/ no weapon ). As you can see Clash of Sabers was and still is the quickest way for the Lightside to change a game. In some cases if you total those 14+X+y+Z it'll probably be about 40 units worth of damage change. How does 1 unit o damage change sound instead of 40 ? That is the difference because of Crush the Rebellion.  Also ,  this lets the Dark Side actually use Prescence of the Force , I have 6 PotFs and I hadn't used one since Jabba's Palace because of Clash of Sabers and Force Choke decks. Prescence and the free up of You Are Beaten ( instead of cancelling Uncontrollable Fury which CoSabers could get ) gives the Dark Side a huge ability to stir it up with the Light Side again.<br>
<br>
I dare say that Yavin 4 : Throne Room choke with OR without Revs was the dominant deck of the Endor time period. This deck was SOO effective and powerful that the mere existance of it enabled the lightside to create more powerful decks. For example , for the Dark Side to be thoroughly protected against Throne Room they'd at least have to have 2-5 Evaders , Bubo , and a nice chunk of locations. Suddenly if I make a Echo Base Operations deck and you used slots on Evaders and Bubo instead of Imperial Decree then my deck suddenly becomes a rogue deck and since you HAVE to be prepped for the Throne Room the Lightside could basically make ANY deck viable just based on the Surprise value. The dominant deck allows many other strategies to become viable. Likewise X-Wing Swarm Might come back because those Evaders would be Grapplers if you didn't have to worry about the Throne Room deck.<br>
<br>
Crush the Rebellion took out the major strategy of Revolution and also helps by letting the Dark Side build force generation decks , grab a powerful Interrupt like I Have You Now , and free up You Are Beaten to try to reach the level of Clash of Sabers. It also makes sure that you don't destroyed by 7 or 8 destinies at a mobile site but note that when your characters are forfeit = 0 two destinies will still hurt.<br>
<br>
Now we move on to the next card.<br>
<br>
Dengar in Punishing One  - Basically the anti-X-Wing Swarm.<br>
<br>
Since Throne Room is dead it was probably predicted that decks would go back to what worked during Special Edition. Hmm. That most likely means X-Wing Swarm ! Now This little guy comes in , cancels ALL IMMUNITY , AND adds 1 to your total battle destiny for each ship. Hmm so Dengar and Dreadnaught versus the Standard 4 X-Wings with S-Foils and Organized Attack. We'll say all destinies drawn are 3s. Lightside's total power would be 24 , immune to attrition , and a destiny of 3 for 27 Power and low deploy. Now the Dark Side would be 9 + destiny 3  + Dengar's ability which means it'd be +4 and now all the immunity is removed. So where the Lightside would've destroyed the Darkside 27 to like 10 and wiped them off the board we now have Security Precautions to suck up the Battle damage and Dengar delivers a nice shot of attrition to their X-Wings. Now they have to lose 2 X-Wings and they don't do any damage besides attritioning out a Dreadnaught. That is huge on the grand scale of things. Dengar also works well versus the Falcon and the new ECC Falcon too. The upside for Dengar just grows to a tremendous amount if you put him with the Bus , Ralltiir Ops , or Vader.<br>
<br>
Boba Fett in Slave 1 - The lone system ship. Bubble Boy .<br>
This little plug can basically hold up his own system. Security Precautions will help you versus huge space decks and he gets destiny and immunity to attrition &lt; 5. The thing I like about him is actually he's a bit of an operative annoyance. Mr. Fett flies in a Starfighter so he can't be Landing Clawed . YIPEE ! But that's not all ! He has got enough power and a destiny so that if he picks up some heat you shouldn't be looking at that much of a loss. He's also good in the Clouds for the new Objective and shutting down the LS counterpart.<br>
<br>
4-LOM - Gametext canceller.<br>
<br>
Well with all these new Dark Side Space enhancements where  can the Lightside turn ? I heard something about these EPP Swarms and that Ben Kenobi fossil. Oh wait there is this 4-Lom guy. 4-LOM is the quickest way to crush a deck. Ben Kenobi can't revive , EPPs can't shoot , Arcona's can't react , this translates into MASSIVE beatdowns following. Suddenly those 3 EPP Destinies turn into 1. In combonation with Imperial Arrest Order EPPs can be tracked and neutralized.<br>
<br>
IG-88 - Ack !<br>
<br>
This guy is just incredibly annoying. Besides being able to instantly capture someone he can't be battled. Basically if they have a good EPP and a Scrub you can clear the site and make off with the EPP. Tracking Destinies just makes him all the more dangerous.<br>
<br>
This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time / Pray I Don't Alter It Further<br>
<br>
This one isn't too strong in the grand scale of things but is pretty nice. Goo Nee Tay basically made the Dark Side stop before even thinking of Bounty Hunting Decks. Starting with Secret Plans and All Wrapped Up brings Capturing and Retrieval Hate. The best thing about this objective is that there is no downside. You can get locations out of reserve and set up a nice Occupation or Dark Deal. This Objective is one of the few that actually manhandles Operatives. Try it out for yourself. Lightside better send heavy stuff over to Cloud City or they get a one way ticket to the next round. I truly believe that once these decks get going Light Side Operatives will be a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
Any Methods Neccessary<br>
<br>
Hmm. This lets you pull out Bounty Hunter fun or get good guys into hand quickly. I don't think it is one of the huge things but I guess it can be annoying to the New LS ECC objective you were thinking about using because you KNOW your gonna see Boba Fett in Slave 1 up there and he's a pain to beat out of the sector.<br>
<br>
Conclusion : Crush the Rebellion by itself crimpled the Dominant Lightside deck and because of that all Light Side decks lost a bit of effectiveness. Now that I'd have to say the Darkside has the Dominant deck the Darkside will be able to kick out a lot of decks ( ISB , HDADTJ , Ominous Rumors , Ralltiir Ops , Normal Ops , and just because of the counters needed to those you can basically make any deck you want and win with the surprise factor ). This is why the Lightside has gone down.<br>

PS- You shouldn't have to wonder what I think is<br>
the dominant Dark Side deck now. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
