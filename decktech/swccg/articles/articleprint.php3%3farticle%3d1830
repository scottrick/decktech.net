All done? Good!<br>
<br>
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY<br>
<br>
Now this whole trip started with a bunch of actual gamers deciding that they needed to go to the World Championship to test their mettle. Me? I suck, but since I had a Rodeo at my disposal, I was immediately elected as an honorary &quot;actual gamer&quot;. Despite some initial problems on Tuesday on my part, we finally got on the big ol&#146; road trip from Augusta, GA to Kissimmee, FL. The two guys I went with were great, and the trip passed by quite nicely until we needed to eat. That was about the time that we hit one of those &#146;Twilight Zone&#146; stretches of highway where there are no restaurants because obviously everyone in the area hunts for their food. Finally, after buying some decent clothes at a hidden away Hot Topic store in some convoluted huge mall in the area, we picked up our 4th member from the airport (where I finally got to start drinking...whew!) and headed to the Doubletree.<br>
<br>
Ok... That little area where the Con was SUCKED. Way too &#146;touristy&#146; for me, not to mention the problem with the construction and the expensive rooms, and the expensive $5.00 cardboard pizza, and the even more expensive $5.60 Jim Beam and Cokes I love. Oh well... After a drink or so, I felt tired enough to unroll my nifty sleeping bag and try to nap among the furious flurry of last minute deck-tweaking and list-making. Floors suck, but at least I didn&#146;t have to worry about accidentally snuggling up to one of the guys in the middle of the night. I get paranoid of that... Honest.<br>
<br>
THURSDAY<br>
<br>
Ok... This sucks... I&#146;m tired... People are noisy... Line is long... Decipher uses Macs... Must..Wake..Up.. ARRGH! Turns out I wasn&#146;t dreaming. So now after a bunch of loooooong minutes (I smoke as well as drink (Don&#146;t start up either of those habits...I don&#146;t need the competition for my vices...) and maybe two hours or so, I am in the Con, I have a badge, a foil card, and a hankering to just quit and go drink.<br>
<br>
My liver protests and I stick around forever waiting for the pairings. I need to sidetrack real quick.<br>
<br>
Ok. I&#146;m a sorry SW player. I&#146;m an excellent Magic player. What do the two have in common? Nothing. Basically, by the 5th turn in my first game, I realize I fell into the dreaded &#146;Meta-trap&#146;. I remember it from M:TG and it&#146;s where you think your deck works because it holds up in your local area. Well, obviously we are a bunch of brainless morons here because I had no SAC nor much of any other type of decent cards. I was never expecting to see sooooo much of those rarely played Objectives, like Hidden Base, nor was I expecting to see nearly every table having at least one or 2 EBO decks. Man... my bad for poor planning.<br>
<br>
I guess Decipher threw in all kinds of money, because they had some very nice and beautiful ladies running the counter at the shop. (more on that later...)<br>
<br>
Longer story shorter, my DS Dark Deal Deck lost once, and my EBO was getting it&#146;s head handed to me from the multiples of Imperial Decree that everyone was playing. I saw some cool moves, but also saw myself falling further and further down the pairings list until my 4th round match came up as a bye. I figured, &#146;Hey! I can still try to get a 4-4 record!&#146;. So charging into the bar, I ordered myself a stiff drink from the lovely waitress/barkeep Cynthia and bolstered my confidence with some liquid whoop-ass.<br>
<br>
After my Happy Hour finished, I walked (staggered?) back to the tourney and awaited my pairing. I went up against someone playing some wierd BHBM/matching pilots/Decree deck that proceeded to roll on my EBO. Not good. That&#146;s when I had my hazy revelation... a drunken euphony if you will.<br>
<br>
I then realized what tech was, or the idea behind it, and came back from a near devastating loss to totally whip my opponent in the air in three consecutive battles with 5 tracked destinies for a one round turnaround defeat. I won by 8 cards. I had to win on that turn or he would have drained me out. I know it ain&#146;t much, but it was worth it.<br>
<br>
Exiting the arena, my sudden strike of jubilation was cut short by one thought: &quot;Since I won, I checked &quot;will continue&quot; on my card... I can&#146;t go back to the bar!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sadly, I moped until my next match, where I got totally whipped and schooled by an excellent German player. Unfortunately, I can&#146;t remember his name right now, otherwise I&#146;d write it down. My sincerest apologies... I think his last name was Probst... He was cool about it though.<br>
<br>
YAY! I then take my sorry butt upstairs and take a shower. Which reminds me... Not to be rude and all, but since all those rooms come with showers, don&#146;t you think that sometimes we should use them? Some of you guys need to do some hygiene... Anyway, I then throw on my &#146;going out clothes&#146; and head to the bar.<br>
<br>
Now keep in mind that these aren&#146;t just any kind of clothes, I&#146;m talking my brand new pair of &#146;Shiny Pants&#146;. I advise every guy (and gal, if you want that kind of attention...) who has the right legs/body ( Guys, ask a girl, don&#146;t take your own word for it, PLEASE!) to get some &#146;Shiny Pants&#146;. I had more people come up just to rub on my legs than I could shake a stick at.<br>
<br>
I meet some cool people, including the infamous &quot;Emily&quot;, and this other girl who right at the last second told me she was not only taken, but she was at the Con to meet her soon to be brother in law. Sheesh... sorry Curt (Kurt? Don&#146;t remember how he spells it).  I also met a cool English couple to join me in some &#146;yards of ale&#146;. Fantastic. Unfortunately, by this time I have struck out with the ladies and got smacked by last call. This day sucks. I then stumble back to my room, hose down the shiny pants (they&#146;re made outta vinyl... easy cleanup!), take another shower and fall asleep.<br>
<br>
FRIDAY<br>
<br>
Ok...it&#146;s Friday. Everyone loves Friday. Me? I LOVE Friday. Fridays are the best.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I&#146;m feeling pretty trashed from my excess of ale from drinking everyone under the table from the night before. I also didn&#146;t get much sleep because I had nightmares of people in the room fighting... :P<br>
<br>
I head downstairs in some slum clothes, and see people that seem to still be up from the day before. I quietly get myself a $5.00 cardboard greasy pizza which strangely hits the spot. After fooling around, I get upstairs and get washed again and change clothes and go tool around downstairs.<br>
<br>
Quick info break for all the single guys: Want to meet some great looking chicks? Play YJ... WOW! Player hotties at a Con? Where did they get THAT idea??? I don&#146;t know either, but I sure did like it!<br>
<br>
I start introducing myself to anyone in a Decipher T-shirt. I figure since I can&#146;t get into the other tourneys going on then I can mingle and whatnot. Bottom line: The Decipherians there were EXTREMELY nice and are worthy of any sort of praise you can give them. They did a GREAT F-ing job as far as I am concerned, and the company owes them big.<br>
<br>
I saw the Emily gal some more, met some players, met a girl who sure as heck didn&#146;t LOOK a bit under 18, let alone under 15 (Yep, that&#146;s right guys, that purty little blonde you were lusting over? Jail bait...). Hung out with the Decipher people some more, and then started playfully heckling that crazy Tuttle guy.<br>
<br>
Somewhere around there I got another couple drinks in me and walked around looking for my compadres. Shortly after I was getting ready to leave to smoke a much needed cigarette, I got snagged into the &quot;Decipher Olympics&quot; for Card House Building. Ok.. I suck at SW, but I can build a card house like a mo&#146;fo&#146;...<br>
<br>
I&#146;m thinking:&quot;Hey, this should be easy, set up a primo house, go smoke a cigarette, and come back for my gold medal&quot;. Then I notice that there are 2 other guys getting involved. I start laughing to myself and think: &quot;Heh, I can just stack 1 level, go smoke, and come back for my bronze...sweet...&quot;. Then, right as that Tuttle guy is about to start, he gets his sweet revenge on me by telling one of the extremely nice and helpful Decipherians to round up some more contestants. Then, the guy has the nerve to smirk at me, as if he was reading my mind.... jeez....<br>
<br>
So now I&#146;m sitting there with a pile of junk in my hand (a bunch of Star Trek rares and foils... as if anybody plays THAT game... ;P), I&#146;m fiending for a cigarette, I need a drink, and we are finally about to start. Now I HAVE to try because there is no FREAKIN&#146; way I am leaving outta there with no medal so Tuttle can make fun of me for the rest of the weekend.<br>
<br>
The crowd seems to slow its frenetic pace. The awful din drops down to merely a mighty roar. The slick glossiness of the ST cards start to stick to my hands. I look behind me... 2 contenders, no, three, wait! Four, Five.. Seven-Eleven.. IT doesn&#146;t MATTER how many there are against me! The Halfbreed says this:&quot; Just bring it!&quot; (Motioning of hand) The room hushes as Tuttle brings the mic up to his mouth, preparing to speak...<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, in Round One..&quot; and a sly smirk to me..<br>
<br>
<br>
Round one? ROUND ONE? OH HELL NO!!! What about my cigarette? What about my bar? This evil Tuttle will wreak his vengeance on me if it&#146;s the last thing he does! Then, as in the day before... it hits me... The milling mass dies away, my breathing slows... I blink... I look at the cards in my hand and turn them over... The text sparkles and shimmers... I see new ideas...new decks...new strategies... the cards vibrate...and speak...<br>
<br>
&quot;Build it, and it will be strong..&quot; (Vague Close Enc. ref.)<br>
&quot;Build with us, Johnny...&quot; (Vague Shining reference)<br>
&quot;Build, and in building, grow strong...&quot; (Vague RPG ref.)<br>
<br>
I look back at Lord Tuttle, his eyes burning into mine... I know... I must build, or everything would be lost...<br>
<br>
The timer is set. I hear small cheers for local favorites..None for me, for I am the lone Halfbreed... A tickle at my nose... I scratch it...a slow, langourous stretch... and as the timer begins its slow spiral downward to the abyss... I look back at Lord Tuttle... his smirk disappears as he sees the fire in my eyes... My gaze bores straight through him...to his very soul... and then he knows... I AM the chosen one... and I smirk back... and build..<br>
<br>
The whole affair was divided into 2 rounds. Round one was the &#146;straight&#146; build, where you could only stack cards like you normally would. In round 2 you could get fancy and bend, fold, tear, spindle, mangle, or otherwise maim your cards to get the full effect. Judging was done on height and on aesthetics (a big word for &#146;prettiness&#146;). Now, more of round one...<br>
<br>
I am a practiced card house builder, so this was a simple task. However, I realized that once the timer started, the whole frickin&#146; room got quiet... That&#146;s bad. I hate quiet. I ESPECIALLY hate quiet when I need a drink or a cig, and I needed both. I looked up to see Lord Tuttle chuckle at my predicament. I can&#146;t POSSIBLY BUILD in this QUIET!!!! So, like any guy might in my position, I began talking to myself. Not just commentary, though. I&#146;m talking full fledged conversations with all my many alter-egos. Well, with that noise, I was able to build, and build I did. By the time the 30 minute round was up, I had a sizeable house and was enacting a play where Dack Ralter was being a bad boyfriend to some *ahem* voluptuous young thing from Austin Powers. Everything was going bad for her until Chewie flew in for the rescue on Luke&#146;s T-16 Skyhopper. Chewie deftly defeated the evil Dack and saved the lady, but was stopped from getting his thank-you kiss by the end of the round.  I suddenly realized that I had stopped building WAY too early and probably lost the round because I had to find out what was going to happen to Chewie. I stood up and looked around at... the utter devastation. Obviously, Chewie forgot to tell me that he had blowed up everyone elses card houses on his way to save the Austin Powers gal. Many card houses lay in ruins. Wow... I then also realized that somewhere along the line I was also doing the biggest no-no when card house building... I was WHISTLING the friggin&#146; soundtrack to my little &#146;movie&#146;. Everyone was stunned.... The biggest blow to my opponents&#146; collective morale was when we were told to bump the tables to knock the cards down. I playfully thumped the table... No effect. Guess the card house &#146;Alter&#146;ed that (Hee hee...). Quick pound. Nothing. Hard pound on the table... Slight shift. I had DONE it! I had made the perfect card house!!! I then had to forcefully shake the table and then use my hands to knock the rest of it down. Man... I rock... that gold is MINE!!!!<br>
<br>
After being the obvious hands down winner in round one, I take my time in round 2. I&#146;m trying to be all fancy and lattice my cards together forming &#146;waffles&#146; and &#146;honeycombs&#146;. Then I get the word that there is 10 minutes left... I look down... Lots of torn cards, not one frickin&#146; levels worth of card house. So I scramble and look behind me at one monstrous Trump Tower of cards...<br>
<br>
Oh crap...<br>
<br>
I&#146;m gonna lose...<br>
<br>
I nearly wet my pants at the thought. My palms sweat...My throat gets dry... My heart gets fluttery... I turn to see the evil crocodile smile of Lord Tuttle... He gets his revenge today. Our eyes meet... and he laughs.<br>
<br>
NO ONE laughs at me...especially during card house building competition!!!!!<br>
<br>
5 minutes left...<br>
<br>
Man, if I could just stop playing this evil Lord Tuttle VS. my good Luke Halfbreed story in my head, I can build something...<br>
<br>
4 minutes...<br>
<br>
DOH!<br>
<br>
I quickly scan at the crap on the table. Lots of mis-tears, bad folds... Wait! Some unbent cards! Perfect! My hands work autonomously of me, as if given some life of their own. A waffle here..some cards...A lattice...some more cards...Sturdy base... Not enough... must get higher...<br>
<br>
2 minutes!<br>
<br>
CRAP!!!! I need more height... I then use my ace-in-the-hole... I merely pick up the last of my cards and begin to fold the cards from right to left... Much more height...Much less stability... An ancient secret handed down in my family from one expert cardhouse builder to the next... I envision the final plan... Eiffel Tower... 2 flats...2 folded...2 flats...2 folded... finally I get to the last level... CRAP.. No more flats or foldeds!!<br>
<br>
1 minute!!!!<br>
<br>
I look at the faraway box of cards...I look at my table... not enough time to get more, fold, and build...I see something at the corner and reach.. It&#146;s a poorly made waffle that looks like a &#146;tic-tac-toe&#146; box!<br>
<br>
My hip casually bumps the table...<br>
<br>
*slide*<br>
<br>
My body freezes... my eiffel tower is unstable! What to do? I concentrate... I hear the cries of misplaced cards in my tower... I speak in Card-ese: &quot;This last waffle...for me...please...&quot; The wail of the cards under undue stress dies down..:&quot;Yes...One...more...waffle..........master...&quot;<br>
<br>
30 seconds!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Gently, caressingly I place the waffle atop my creation...The screams of the cards are too much... a single folded from the 3rd level falls to the tabletop.. I lean in close to hear it&#146;s dying words:&quot;My single life....for the strength...of...the...whole...&quot; It dies.<br>
<br>
Time&#146;s up!<br>
<br>
Shattered and shocked, I step back. The cards are stable now. My art looks terrible, but it holds. I look back and can&#146;t see the rear of the room because there is this huge,blue.... HOLY CRAP! THAT&#146;S A BIG FRIGGIN&#146; CARD HOUSE! I stand silent. The contender smiles. Lord Tuttle smiles. I feel bruised and beaten and in DEFINITE NEED of a cigarette and a drink, but I shall stand by my cards as they stood by me in my time of need.<br>
<br>
The judging is swift, cruel, yet efficient. Tallies are made. Lord Tuttle wrinkles his brow... shakes his head... and clears his throat. He asks for a big round of applause. I hear the roar from the audience, but as if it is far away. The cards speak to me weakly: &quot;Did we do well master?&quot; I stoically reply: &quot;Yes cards, you have done your best.&quot; The cheers for the local favorite are drowning out the rest, but no matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Third Place, for the bronze goes to....&quot;<br>
<br>
I shift to walk forward...<br>
<br>
&quot;Guy with really big hotel o&#146; cards!!&quot;<br>
Not me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Second Place and the silver..&quot;<br>
A name is called... and it isn&#146;t me...<br>
<br>
<br>
Crud... I lost... From the house the Halfbreed built I hear a quiet weeping of the cards. I have failed...<br>
<br>
&quot;And finally, First place and the gold......&quot;<br>
<br>
I glance at my feet...ears burning with rage...eyes tearing with the thought of cruel defeat...<br>
<br>
&quot;...the guy who talked to himself the whole time...Johnny Grigonis!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I turn away...???? Me? I won? OH YEAH!!! WHO DA MAN? WHO DA MAN?? My tears of sadness turn to joy as I stride forth smartly, offering my neck to the beautiful staff member offering me the gold. I turn to Lord Tuttle. Our eyes meet. A slow stare ensues until finally, he relents, with an acknowleging nod. I return the nod...with a smirk.<br>
<br>
Somewhere after that I finally got to have myself a cigarette and a drink or two..or three...or four...or a whole lot.... Hell, I deserved it! As the day passed, I saw more of the ubiquitous &quot;Emily&quot;, and started becoming good friends with Decipher. Lord Tuttle did eventually get his revenge by telling large groups of people that I was to be &quot;slugged&quot; in the arm if I was in the convention area without my medal. He specifically denies this, but I know better. Besides... getting punched in the arm is a decent memory jogger. As night enveloped the resort, I retired to my room for a quick shower. I noticed that my &#146;Shiny Pants&#146; were dry, and tried my luck with them downstairs. I figured that I would probably fit in since many people didn&#146;t have the time to change their clothes since Wednesday morning. Again, the power of the &#146;Shiny Pants&#146; prevailed and won me many a free drink.<br>
<br>
Just to say this before I forget, there was this one guy from Canada that got REALLY drunk and tried hitting on every single lady in the hotel. I didn&#146;t mind at first because I thought he was funny. Then he started hitting on the one I had my eye on since the day before and almost got stomped by your Olympic Hero. I can&#146;t remember his name, but he finished like 2nd in the YJ tournament that day and his name was Phillip, or Phillipe, or Pip, or something else screwed up like that. I don&#146;t know if I said it earlier, but if you can&#146;t drink, then don&#146;t drink around me.<br>
<br>
I met with my English Couple friends again and saw the infernal &quot;Emily&quot;. I then hid out mainly with the Decipherians trying to see if I could hit them up for a couple of cases of free product. That didn&#146;t pan out, but I would like to say that I did meet some great people and hopefully I can call some of them friends. We drank some more and tooled around some more. Drinking is fun! I ended up chatting with the beautiful Michonne (Aurra Sing, I think) before I ended up passed out somewhere in the arms of a beautiful, wonderful and lovely woman (Not the nefarious &quot;Emily&quot;...thank god...).<br>
<br>
SATURDAY<br>
<br>
Saturday was bad. Doing nothing but drinking and eating the occasional $5.00 greasy cardboard pizza isn&#146;t good for the health. I splurged somewhere and got some real fast food and tooled around some more. I was sober enough to remember lots of the people I had met the night before, and chatted with them and even played a few pickup games. Although I lost, I had lots of fun and learned more &#146;tech&#146;.<br>
<br>
Saturday was pretty much the same. I think there was some kind of finals or something going on, because someone gave me 20 bucks that I supposedly won by betting that Sokol would be champ. Wow... I&#146;m good... Saturday was a day mainly for trading it seemed, not to mention a day to relax without the thought of more bad evil tournament action in the next day. I hung out more with the Decipher peeps, met some Ghetto Squadron types, met more &#146;big name&#146; players, saw that girl &quot;Emily&quot;, and relaxed. Oh, then I drank some more and ended up the day in the arms of a beautiful, wonderful, and lovely woman. (Definitely NOT the harlot &quot;Emily&quot;.)<br>
<br>
SUNDAY<br>
<br>
Sunday sucked... Sundays almost always suck.... I woke up late and almost didn&#146;t get outta my room in time. I missed the team tourney, but waited for my crew to get done. When that was up, we said our tearful goodbyes and returned to the open road.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, for the section we&#146;ve all been waiting for......<br>

Clay, Tony, and everyone else back home. YOU GUYS SUCK! I&#146;m draggin&#146; y&#146;all to the next one...<br>
<br>
Hot Chicks who look legal but ain&#146;t. HEY! STOP IT! That&#146;s like false advertising and stuff!!!! Grrr.... Stupid Jail-bait!<br>
<br>
Emily. For making me hide in the bar. Psycho, self-centered stalker-chicks give me the creeps. If ya want it, then ask! Otherwise, leave me alone!!!!!!!!<br>

@*$#&($^ type players. This is still a game. Being an !*#&%($ just makes you suck. Not trying to mention any names, but you know who you are. Like the student said to the sensei, &quot;It&#146;s just a Game,Master...&quot; ;P Oh, it&#146;s true, it&#146;s true....<br>

Everyone/everything else that sucked. Hmm... I think I covered most things already. Just because I didn&#146;t get your name down in the type, doesn&#146;t mean anything. Oh, unless you suck. Then I am mad I forgot about you and will try to rectify the situation.<br>
<br>
And finally for the Slops, The great state of Virginia! Thanks for being so Frickin&#146; far away that I can&#146;t just waltz over and say hi to all my Decipher friends...Stupid state....<br>
