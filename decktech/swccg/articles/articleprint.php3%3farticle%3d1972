He advocates never losing Force to cards like Visage voluntarily and trying to &quot;get away with&quot; draining for free while Battle Order is on the table, merely playing dumb and saying &quot;Oh yeah&quot; if you get caught.<br>
<br>
After reading this (and also reading the exhaustive Community Buzz posts concerning this topic), I found myself trying to define my own principles when it comes to this &quot;shady&quot; practice.  I would be both errant and naive if I truly believed that all Star Wars players are honest when it comes to tournament play.  I myself have even incorporated some of the examples Clint gives in his editorial.	But more is at stake when a player selectively &quot;forgets&quot; and &quot;remembers&quot; various intricacies of gameplay than merely a win or a loss.  The integrity of the entire tournament structure is in jeopardy, not to mention the future success of the game.<br>
<br>
Before we get into this, however, I would like to give you my own personal philosophy on &quot;cheating&quot; in a Star Wars CCG tournament game.  I have attempted to define the principles by which I try to play, and have found that not everything I have done in the past has been totally justified.  It is a hard pill to swallow, but I admit that I have &quot;forgotten&quot; rules at key moments before, and I would wager that most of the top players in the game have done the same.  But simply becasue everyone does it does NOT justify it for yourself.  Just think where the tournament environment would be if every player who has been &quot;cheated&quot; on has decided that they are justified in &quot;cheating&quot; themselves?  There would be no integrity whatsoever.	So here are my rules for what I consider cheating:<br>
<br>
1) If it is YOUR card, it is YOUR responsibility...<br>
<br>
Basically, you are responsible for the effect each card in your deck has on the game, whether that effect may be detrimental or beneficial to you.  For example, if you deploy Anger, Fear, Aggression, it is entirely your responsibility to remind me to lose the Force when the card pops.  And if you deploy Bad Feeling Have I, it is your responsibility to remind me to pay extra for my mains.	In other words, when you decide to deploy a card which affects me in the game, you are the one who has elected to alter the mechanism of the game with your card, and it should be entirely your job to see that its effects are carried out.  Otherwise, there would be an undue burden on each of us to keep up with not only our own cards, but our opponents&#146; too (which is a developed skill of a superior player and is not shared by all who play the game, such as beginners).<br>
<br>
Some of you may see this as being dishonest, but I respectively disagree.  Whereas I wish that every player would ALWAYS follow the rules of every card, this is an unreasonable demand to make on players.  If it was considered cheating every time I &quot;forgot&quot; to lose Force to your Visage, then it would be entirely up to my own personal integrity as to whether I am cheating.  Therefore, following this hypothesis to its logical zenith, any player who decides to be occasionally dishonest and selectively &quot;forgets&quot; about such cards would have a distinctly unwarranted advantage over honest players.  Therefore, the players at the top of the game would inevitably be the most dishonest.  Is this what we want?	Certainly not.	Therefore, I recommend allowing your opponents a little slack when they apparently &quot;forget&quot; to follow the text of your own cards.  Let it be your responsibility to remind your opponent when such texts must be followed.<br>
<br>
This rule would also work in the reverse.  If I deploy Battle Plan, it should be MY responsibility to remember to pay the 3 Force to drain.  It is a card I have included in my deck, which presumes that I know its function in my deck.  And when I &quot;forget&quot; to respect its effect on the game, I am being dishonest.  This is not to dismiss a call for heightened player vigilance in tournament play (i.e. you should still &quot;know your opponent&#146;s cards&quot; as Clint suggests), but it should at least encourage players to play honestly with their own cards.<br>
<br>
2) If it is NOT your card (or action), then it is NOT your responsibility, but be considerate...<br>
<br>
I realize this is directly related to the point I just made, but I say this to remove any doubt as to my view of how to deal with your opponent&#146;s cards in gameplay and to further define my own responsibilities to my opponent.<br>
<br>
If your opponent has Visage on the table, don&#146;t lose to it until your opponent reminds you to.  Same goes for anything else of your opponent&#146;s cards which affect you (Ralltir Ops, Bad Feeling, Civil Disorder, the Court objective, Battle Plan, Order To Engage, whatever).  But I further limit myself in two ways concerning this policy (and for the sake of a better game, I recommend you to as well):  First, if my opponent reminds me of something at least twice in a game, I will voluntarily follow that rule the rest of the game without a reminder.	Basically, if my opponent has reminded me, to continue my feigned ignorance is an insult to my opponent, and I will follow that card as consistently from there on as possible.  Second, if I am playing an obviously inferior player and have virtually no chance of losing the game, I will voluntarily take into account every card (mine and opponent&#146;s) that affects my game.  This way, we won&#146;t &quot;step all over&quot; beginners and will always be able to help out and encourage those who may not be as skilled as ourselves.  In other words, be considerate.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if your opponent is taking an action and makes a mistake which is advantageous to you, you are under no obligation to correct him.  For example, if you notice that your opponent forgets to activate Force for Security Precautions, you shouldn&#146;t have to remind him.  However, as most of us probably agree entirely with this rule, we should continue to be considerate of beginners and mediocre players and point out such mistakes in order to encourage their future in the game as well as the future of the game itself.<br>
<br>
3) If you violate a RULE of the game, you ARE cheating...<br>
<br>
In other words, if you deliberately take illegal actions which violate the basic rules of the game (i.e. not merely changes to the game brought on by the text of deployed cards), you are being dishonest.  Examples of this are activating more Force than you are allowed, forfeiting fewer cards from a battle than is required, losing fewer cards to a Force drain than what is called for, paying too few Force to deploy a card, etc.  These are all blatant violations of the rules and should be met with similar penalties (i.e. disqualification) when they are shown to be intentional.<br>
<br>
I have played against many players who have activated too much Force (more than twice in a game), &quot;forgotten&quot; to lose cards to attrition, peaked at their destiny numbers before deciding whom to target with a saber, losing Force to the Used Pile, etc.  I have a low tolerance for this, and I am proud to say that I don&#146;t practice any of these underhanded tactics.  Unfortunately when players do little things such as these, they can always play &quot;dumb&quot; and deny knowledge of their wrongdoing (saying for instance, &quot;Oh, sorry about that,&quot; and taking it back), so it is almost always impossible to prove anything to a judge.  I admit that sometimes I get so raptured in the complex intricacies of the game (such as tracking destinies and remembering seldom-used functions of certain cards), I have accidentally forgotten more remedial functions of the game (as has every player, no doubt), but conversely I have done the opposite as well (i.e. activating too few Force or losing too much to a Force drain).<br>
<br>
So my advice concerning this is merely, &quot;Watch your opponent.&quot;  I make it a point in every tournament game to count my opponents Force as he activates and uses it, for example, and I always recheck every statistic given by my opponent (such as his total Power in a battle, etc.).  This is not done to be rude, but rather to watch for any mistakes across the board, whether intentional or not.  Besides, this is always a good policy, and will help improve your game.<br>
<br>
4) Respect your opponent...<br>
<br>
Any external actions made with the intent to disrupt your opponent&#146;s game (i.e. actions which take place outside the game) are unsportsmanlike and wrong.	For example, if you constantly ask your opponent how many cards he has in his hand in order to try and get him to forget to Force drain or something, you are being very unsportsmanlike and are &quot;cheating&quot; to an extent.  I once had an opponent who wore a nude photo of Leia around his neck at a regional for this very purpose.<br>
<br>
I admit things like this are not always blatant &quot;cheating,&quot; but rather mere distraction techniques.  But tactics such as these should always be frowned upon.  When you sit down to play a game of Star Wars, you should exclusively be engaged in a mental &quot;chess-like&quot; competition with your opponent, entirely limited to the scope of the game itself.	Any time a player introduces distractions beyond the scope of the game, it is evident of degenerate conduct and is always unsportsmanlike at the very least (if not cheating).	In other words, respect your opponent.<br>
<br>
5) Respect the game...<br>
<br>
Similar to #4, you should also respect the game itself when it comes to external temptations at dishonesty.  Some players will play without sleeves on their cards so they can identify certain cards by the wear-and-tear apparent on them.  Also, some players will situate cards in different directions or play with miscut cards in their decks in order to identify certain advantageous destiny numbers or cards they need to draw.  Some will stack certain necessary cards at certain intervals in their deck to insure drawing those cards quicker in a game (despite a cut).  Even others will play with 61 cards in a local tournament thinking, &quot;Nobody will ever count my deck.&quot;  This is blatant cheating.<br>
<br>
In order to watch for this, insist on counting the opponent&#146;s deck before a game and re-situate all the cards the same way as you count.  You should also shuffle the opponent&#146;s deck as you count.  I realize that it seems rude to demand this (and I admit, I rarely do), but if you are playing someone you&#146;ve never met, I would nevertheless recommend this every time.<br>
<br>
Another more questionable form of &quot;cheating&quot; along this same thread is stalling-out your opponent in gameplay.  I realize there is a wide chasm of opinions on this topic, and there is no clear answer as to what is appropriate or not in this field, so I will merely give you my OPINION on this matter and move on.  I think stalling an opponent out in order to get a modified win in a tournament is questionable at the very least.	If you are in a game with 5 minutes left and you are ahead in Force but will surely lose if you hurry, you may choose to &quot;take your time&quot; and let the 5 minutes run (therefore earning a timed win).	If you were considerate of your opponent, you should at least realize that they have won the game and draw up to be honorable.	But this is not necessary.  Tournament games are limited to one hour, and if your opponent cannot beat you in that one hour, then you should have to right to win in time, but this doesn&#146;t give you a right to stall.  I will leave it at that cryptic explanation for you to decide for yourself.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
<br>
Methods of dealing with such infractions have ranged from Mike Girard&#146;s exhaustive &quot;Mega Tournament Guidelines&quot; to Decipher&#146;s immutable automatic disqualification policy.	But I think the realm of responsibility lies chiefly with the players.	If you see your opponent doing something suspicious, just tell him.  Nine times out of ten, he won&#146;t do it anymore.<br>
<br>
But nonetheless, you should ask yourself, &quot;What do I gain when I &#146;forget&#146; certain cards or when I activate too much Force?&quot;  &quot;What do I lose?&quot;  The game of Star Wars is precisely what Clint defines as &quot;a mental game,&quot; but there is a certain code of honor we should all follow to endear respect in not only our opponents, but the whole game itself.  Remember why you play this game.  Do you play only to win?  Or do you play Star Wars for the fun of the game and for the fellowship between players?  Hopefully the latter.<br>
<br>
Some of you will say that one should NEVER intentionally forget game text, whereas others will say that there&#146;s nothing wrong with &quot;forgetting&quot; every rule in the game if it suits your purpose to win.	Whatever your opinion, merely realize that the success of the game and the enjoyment of its players is entirely determined on its integrity.  Although it is certainly a tragedy when players are purposely dishonest with their opponents, you must realize that if tournaments became cesspools of cutthroat manipulation and the inconsiderate determination for victory, many of us will stop having fun, and the game will fade.  And that would be the worst tragedy of all.<br>
