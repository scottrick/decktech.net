WHy you would make a card that allows you to lose over a sixth of your deck is insane.  Hopefully reflections will repair things.  I think right now my biggest complaints about the game is that the watto box fed into some of the sickest decks already out there (ie hunt down).  Decipher needs to quit pumping up dueling, direct damage, and focus on battling!  In ep 1 only,  maul is almost unbeatable!  From what it sounds though, the side deck will help out nicely against podracing, which has always been gay.

In my experience, I&#146;ve found that light side wins more podraces than<br>
dark. And light side needs some good Senators so that they have more<br>
of an incentive to go to the Senate then just to stop the dark from<br>
being too powerful.<br>

Ive enjoyed the game for the last three years. The recent expansions make me wanna throw in the towel. The game is becoming less fun and interactive. I like the fact that you are keeping things tossed up withnew expansions but i think 5 in one year is a couple to many. the thing i would suggest is to downscale podracing and bring back interactivness.<br>

Be sure to send letters to all the executives that might have Decipher&#146;s ear including RebelBaseLeader.<br>
Please remind them that the gaming community is best represented through DeckTech (scary as that is).  Their lead customers are represented through DeckTech.  (Sorry Decipher, Stir Crazy just doesn&#146;t sell the way SWCCG does!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s my letter:<br>
<br>
To Decipher (Creators of Star Wars CCG):<br>
I have been a long time player.  I still remember the day when Hoth finally hit the shelves and I was excited because my second rare was Commander Luke Skywalker.  It was a time when the game was growing.<br>
I continue to be as active a player and Tournament Director as I can be.  I participate in my local community and the world community through Deck Tech.  My Christmas list is jam packed with Decipher products both released and to-be-released.<br>
I know that there is much dissention in the SWCCG community as of late.  I also know that many top and active players are leaving the game (more publicly and in mass than any time that I am aware of).  As I understand it, the most vocal complaints relates to lack of fun.  This is an unspecific comment and does not provide feedback to you, the producer, as how to improve the game and the morale of the consumers.  <br>
Therefore, allow me to give you my view... First, I do not mind the newer less interactive options.  I feel that this actually opens up the game to many different types of players.  This, in turn, allows more decks to be developed which I feel makes the playing environment more fun.  What does, I feel, make the game less enjoyable is a few select things.  The first is cranky and over competitive players.  Now I realize that Decipher has minimal control over this.  What Decipher can do is actively recruit newer players.  (When I started playing, most sci-fi/fantasy conventions had a Squadron Member or Decipher representitive doing demos and giving away product.  Young players could recieve Jedi Packs to start their collection.)  A second thing that I feel has hurt the game is the rumors and discussion of the upcoming Decipher loss of their rights to produce the Star Wars game.  No player wants to join a game that might die in a few months and experienced players are equally wary of losing their favorite pasttime.  I believe that this needs to be addressed with your consumers in some way.  A third problem that arrised in 2001 is the rapid release of so many sets.  Deck ideas were never adaquately explored from one set before a new one was released.  In addition, most players could never afford to keep up or complete a collection due to time and financial restraints.  (The time when we waited between sets many months and usually past a scheduled release date actually improved anticipation and caused myself to purchase more of the previous set and the newer release.)  I must admit that I feel that I am a poorer player because of this lack of time between sets.  Fourth, I am worried about the new card type.  Where having so many cards does make building a 60 card deck very challenging, it also opens up many possiblities too.  I hope that this new &quot;side deck&quot; does not provide so much protection against strategies that some can not be used anymore.  (I liked that &quot;numbers&quot; decks effectively gave a player a chance without using only main characters.)  Lastly, I know that many players feel that they do not have a voice in the direction of the game.  I believe that it would benefit the morale of many players to know that Decipher will hear their opinions.  Not only hear them, but wants them.  I know that this is difficult, but perhaps a simple Email or contest or give-away for the players who respond to an Email survey or interview will go a long way while envigorating the direction of the game.<br>
I approve of the design of the creation of the Galactic Senate and the new Jedi Masters.  The way Decipher designed them seems to keep a balance between the films and yet not making them too powerful.  (Very few decks are unbeatable; just that some are so more effective than others that they become the staple.)<br>
<br>
Thank you for considering my opinion,<br>

Dear Decipher,<br>
<br>
I have been playing Star Wars CCG since it&#146;s release in 1995, and I absolutely LOVE the game.  However, with the release of Coruscant and Podracing, the game has become non-interactive and therefore less fun.  Star Wars is about interaction and battling to keep your ground.  However, if someone is just hanging around waiting to win a big podrace, then there&#146;s no fun there.  The force lost during the podrace will just be retrieved by the Dark side anyways.  Please, tone down Podracing or just get rid of it completely.  Also, the senate is a good idea, but it needs to be more interactive with non-senate decks.  Make some kind of &#146;killer cards&#146; like Ounee Ta was to Ralltir Ops.  Please bring this game back to it&#146;s battling roots.  It will be much better in the long run.  Thank you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=6237">PCGSAlucard</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Podracing, and senate is gay...

<br>
dear (yeah right) decipher,<br>
<br>
stop trying to out-do yourself with each expansion. i remember when i looked forward to new sets anticipating what cards i could take and put in my *existing* decks instead of dreading what brand-new strategy i was going to be forced into playing or countering next. it really is ok to make more sets like endor, where instead of getting over-powered new mechanics (podracing, senate) we get cards that mold the game into a more perfect shape (battle plan, insurrection). did you even playtest the wys vs dark senate matchup?? that has got to be the most boring, aggravating game i have played since i dont know when. obviously by making each set contain some powerful new mechanic you are boosting your immediate revenues; but on the flip side i think you can see you are creating quite a bit of discontent amongst your customer base.<br>

i do not think senat is not interactive, and i like podracing as a new game feature, STILL i don&#146;t think anybody would play podracing for any less then they get now...you gotta dedicate so much room in your deck to successfully potrace that it is not to much benefit to get for it...you need like 12 cards for podracing...for ONLY a forceswing of 22...how much damage can the lightside do with 6 cards? how much can it retrieve?? it s not imbalanced i think...<br>
<br>
senat is interactive aswell! it has to be!...sure hold one location and drain for +2 there puts a lot of pressure on your opp...but why don&#146;t you just play menace fades? maul drains for on at mos espa db isn&#146;t too scary... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=5885">Eldorian</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">k </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=4755">Dark Padawan</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Nice, not the better place for this, but I totally agree with you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=3530">Garion</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I may not agree with much of what you said but you get 5 stars for your good cause and because that dianoga kid is a meat head. Ok so I think Podracing is decent enough but all by itself will not win games. Also The Senate rocks and is big time interactive it has to be. I can&#146;t win the game by sitting in the senate and making you lose 1 force every turn. I have to use guys or ships to go out and drain or kill your things. You then can battle me thus interaction. Oh and I must say that the DS Senate against Watch Your Step is a great match up. I played my DS Senate deck against a top player in my Region and he had Watch Your Step and we had a great game. Tons of battleing both in space and on land back inforth a very intense game of chess sort of speak. It was one of the best games I have had in a while. Decipher does have so problems with the game though. So here is my letter to them. <br>

<br>
Dear Decipher Staff,<br>
<br>
     I have some concerncs about the card mechanics that are currenly coming out. Though I enjoy podracing from time to time. The current state of thing are that you must win the Pod Race vs Watto&#146;s Box or loose the game. I did it can be almost as devistating. This forces me to play with 8 cards devoted to winning a podrace. Which I dont want to run all the time. I would prefer to move those cards that would enhance my strategy for QMC or Tat Occ decks that I have enjoyed and always will enjoy as long as they can be sucessful around 50% of the time. <br>
     On the Brite side I enjoy manipulation decks. I enjoy those decks which allow you to search your reserve and force piles. DS Senate is awsome but I am afraid it might be just a little bit too powerful. This forces me to play Senators in my LS deck that I would not always run or get nailed with a 5 force drain where maul will be immune to attrition w/ The Phantom Menace. I love manipulation but Please do not force others who do not enjoy it as much as me to play it.<br>
      The Tatooine Maul is wonderful (good work) The Phantom Menace Is just too powerful. Especially in the EP1 environment. Yes, in the movie Obi Wan won by a fluke but to properly portray this in the EP1 environment is devistating when coupled with senators. All you can do is run away. The best combat vs him is to stick Obi Wan there and pray like hell that you can draw a 5 for destiny (he has no Lightsaber!!!). <br>
<br>
     In conclusions here is a quick sum Up<br>
<br>
1) Please fix pod racing so that I don&#146;t need to run Pod counters in every deck I design.<br>
<br>
2) DS Senate is wonderful but make it so that LS can compete as well<br>
<br>
3) Tat Maul is awesome.<br>
<br>
4) Phantom Menace is too unbalancing in EP1. Make Obi&#146;s  Stick and some way to counter against it.<br>

But I will offer a few suggestions. Help out a little bit more with some prize support extras, the best thing that can happen to a little dude, is for him to walk out with some prizes boosting his morale, even if he placed last (thats when he&#146;ll need it the most). Also, prehaps you could sell reflections a little bit cheaper, those packs are life savers for people just getting into the game and who need to catch up. Also, ADVERTISE, that is a major must, in all Star War based magazines and possibley even TV on a major show or something, it would really help.... in my view that is. For the game itself, prehaps some ways to erratum those bullets, some decks you just didn&#146;t hurt, you destroyed, utterly, I mean hurting a deck is good, but make it still playable, such as Ral Ops or something..... On the plus side, I love the Jedi Council, though I think some of them should be a little bit more powerful in their deploy/forfeit ratio, and prehaps better game text.... Also Yoda should be able to bring back the Jedi as well, thanks...<br>

Dear Decipher,<br>
     I have been playing SWCCG for nearly three years now, and until recently have been very pleased with the game.  <br>
     My favorite time was around the Death Star 2 expansion, when people were playing space and ground, a variety of decktypes, and each decktype had its own gameplan; nothing was unbeatable.  <br>
     With Jabba&#146;s Palace Sealed Deck I was impressed with some of the new cards, like Lando with Vibro Axe and Underworld Contacts, however, Scum and Villainy decks were way overpowered.  No Escape was another card in question, as well as Ounee Ta.  I feel both of these have their ups and downs.  <br>
     Reflections 2 was a pretty good expansion.  The combo cards were all very balanced, and the two new decktypes were both fun to play and competitive.  At the time the Watch Your Step objective was all good; it gave LS players some hope for a deck to play to be competitive until Tatooine, where, hopefully several options would be available.  <br>
     Tatooine wasn&#146;t too bad of an introduction to the Episode 1 cards, but it had its flaws.  The decktype fixers were good and bad.  I was pleased with the deck fixers, but some of them like We Shall Double Our Efforts were still underpowered and didn&#146;t make their decktype too good, just gave it an opportunity to be played.  If The Trace Was Correct was a great card that was pretty balanced.  But Podracing is lame.  It is basically a flip over a couple cards and cause a major Force swing just as your opponent is trying to set up.  The anti-alien counters seemed to go a little overflow, but I can see that they are quite balanaced since not many people need to play them.  The Camp is a little harsh, but I know that Scum decks need their time out.  <br>
     Coruscant seemed cool at first, politics seemed like a great new mechanic, and it looked good.  But Coruscant was actually terrible.  Politics take up some card slots, but they&#146;re also very strong.  In any normal deck you should be able to counter something, but not entirely stop it, with a few cards in your deck.  But politics offer no counter solutions except playing politics yourself, which, if you&#146;re playing light to overpower dark politics you need to take up well over half your deck just to take the senate.  Alter can ruin some political effects, but that can be countered easily.  How about making a card for each side similar to Demotion to counter Senators?  The Dark side version may only need 1 on table, but the light may need two on table.  This way a non-senate deck can play their own game and not find Darth Maul is at over 20 power, has excluded your character, and your other character is forfeit=0.  And what was up with the cards that actually strengthened Podracing?  I really don&#146;t think it needed more help. <br>
     Some things in SWCCG I am really liking.  The Episode 1 environment may involve a little more luck because of new mechanics than I care for, but otherwise it is a blast to play with a lot of interactiveness and you have to think of good ways to counter other things you might see.  Though Podracing and Senate can hurt, they can be countered more easily.  <br>
     Remember when I said that Watch Your Step seemed like a temporary solution to help light decks deal with Scum?  Only one problem, since it came out in January, WYS has been basically the only Light deck that can win consistantly.  It is getting kind of lame.<br>
     I hope that the game can improve back to what it used to be.  I really hope lightsaber combat isn&#146;t another theme one can just throw together and have a good shot of winning with.  Qui-Gon and Darth Maul, especially Maul are getting to be annoying in that there is no way to counter them either.  How about Maul have an Uncontrollable Fury of his own?  I really hope the Defensive Shield cards aren&#146;t just going to make it easier to counter decktypes that already aren&#146;t played due to the risk factor of a counter card.  I also hope the deck helper cards can strengthen old and forgotten decks to the point that when I try to find a deck to make I pull out 10 objective cards instead of 2 to consider.  I also hope the new mains in Reflections 3 are good to play, but are also very balanced and don&#146;t just eliminate the possibility of playing one of the older versions of that main.  <br>
     Please consider my thoughts and the thoughts of others and try to improve SWCCG.  It really is losing interest for me.  I&#146;d hate to see the game I&#146;ve been playing for three years go down the drain.  Thanks.<br>

3. no one plays old objectives anymore. if u just release `magic bullet&#146; cards to kill &#146;em, and cards to counter those cards, and more magic bullets, you&#146;ll find urself with 60 cards to just protect ur objective.<br>

Dear Decipher,<br>
I have really enjoyed playing and collecting Star Wars.  However, some things you have done lately have made that harder on us players.  I am talking about game mechanics such as podracing, senate, and other non-interactive ideas.  It would be fun to have more deploying and battling in the game.  Also recently the expansions have been coming out to fast for some players to keep up with.  It would be nice to have them slowed down to 2 or 3 a year.  Thanks for your great game.  I would love to see it improved so I and others can keep playing it.<br>

Dear SWCCG staff,<br>
I have enjoyed Star Wars since premiere.  I took a 3 year hiatus from Hoth to Endor, but I was drawn back by objectives and my friends who had remained loyal followers of the game.  However, recently, I think that the introduction of Episode I cards have really hurt the feel of the game.  There just isn&#146;t as much skill involved now as there has been in the past.  I hate the Podracing mechanic so much that I HAVE to play it.  There&#146;s no other option.  If I don&#146;t play it, I WILL lose.  I don&#146;t feel that there should be any game mechanic that you can say, &quot;If I don&#146;t play this in my deck, I will lose!&quot;  I don&#146;t necessarily believe that this should be removed from the environment, but I believe there should be &quot;useful&quot; cards that cancel Watto&#146;s Box and I Did It!  And if you make them vulnerable to sense, that will put some skill into podracing and give a realistic but not over-compensating defense versus Podracing.  I feel that Star Wars has gone down this road before when Dagobah released odds inserts.  However, the environment is much better now.  I think that we need to rejuvenate the game once again or the community is in major jeopardy.<br>

<br>
I have played your game for many years and have watched it go downhill. Expansions like dagobah, hoth, and coruscant have depressed players and made me think about quitting the game. I like that you&#146;re trying to incorporate episode into your game but your not doing to well. Senate for one is a big dissapointment where the ONLY way to counter it is to have senate yourself. It is also very powerful. Not even jedi masters who kick major @$$ have less benefits that senators who are just elected people who think their cool. Jedi are defenders of the galaxy and should not be confined to a chamber the size of my english classroom.<br>
You got off to a great start but the rules you have made have horribly unbalanced the game. Impress us with good quality slowly produced well thought over and fun for both sides of the force expansion sets. Thank you for taking the time to read this now go make a good set please!!!<br>

<br>
BUT, I disagree with you totally. Me and my friends (all tournament players) have no problem with the current Meta. We have grown to adapt the new expansions into our current play. Now think of this. . .RIII and Theed Palace aren&#146;t even out, what will be hurt or helped then. I wish people would stop complaining and put their efforts to working on their decks instead. Not only is it not fun to be complaining all of the time, but you are less likely to tell others about how great a game it really is.<br>
<br>
Now, I don&#146;t play Magic, but I have heard horror stories about what they have done to it. I do not feel that Decipher has hurt the game. Maybe some of you are phasing SWCCG out of your life because you have found other things to occupy your time, but I don&#146;t think you should take it out on everyone else just because you &quot;feel&quot; the current Meta isn&#146;t right. You say the current game is non-interactive, but it isn&#146;t near as bad as the original operatives, now they were broken.<br>
<br>
And if you think of it, I think Decipher is pulling it off just about right. On Tatooine and Coruscant (in the movie), were there any major battles? Besides the duel on Tatooine (represented by Maul Strikes) there wasn&#146;t much going battle wise so the movie was showing podracing, searching for the queen, searching for a hyperdrive, and meddling in the Senate. Theed Palace is when all the fighting comes. Do you think they are going to make Battle Droids, Gungans, Palace Gaurds, and Tanks just to place them at the Senate or Podrace Arena? I think not! They are creating them for BATTLES.<br>
<br>
That is totally my opinion which I am entitled to, but I do feel atleast some of it is right. What I am trying to say is, don&#146;t give up on the game, give it time. If we all gave up that easily, shouldn&#146;t you have left after Endor? </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2371">5D6-RA7</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Decipher Staff,<br>

I believe that Star Wars Customizable Card Game should be made more accessable to people who aren&#146;t millionares.  I for example can&#146;t buy boxes at a time, and your current price for 11-card packs is more than your original price for 15-card packs.  I understand that you are a company and need to turn a profit, but the high price is making me less interested in purchasing your product.<br>

Distribution of rares has been a joke from what I have seen. The boxes are clearly marked with codes and they end up going to the different areas of the country withe same dam rares in every box so you end up with extras of c.rappy rares and none of the few good rares. Case in point...10 boxes of COruscant opened here and No Amidala but 12 Rune Haakos and 25 Vote Nows. Swell.<br>

Play testing should be done by good players before the cards are selected for a set. The game designers are way to diverse. One promotes s.hit like pod racing and the other promotes interactive battling. What gives?<br>

With RFII, battling was over. The top decks were AOBS, Big blue with Imperial Command, WYS with extreme smuggler power, and Hidden Base with mains. Since Tatooine and Podracing/Senate, the top decks look like Magic decks. Large amounts of direct damage (Podracing), and old-school manipulation (Screws are coming back, Limited Resources, etc.) Truly, the game is reverting. I would like to see more battle cards/stratigies, and less Senate/Podracing. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2134">Gen</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hope this helps keep the game that we all love alive.<br>

Dear Decipher:<br>
<br>
     I have been collecting SWCCG since the beginning.  I remember when the game was about combat, with buddy cards and the whole deal.  Since then, we have invented drain cancelers, direct damage, and podracing.  Each one of these strategies reduced the interactiveness of the game, now to a point where (especially with battle interrupts) fighting offensively is all but suicidal.  If you lose a race with the box out, you&#146;re toasted.  If DS Senate stays flipped against you and has anti-SAC, you can&#146;t touch them because they will cancel drains and retrieve consistently while dealing constant damage via cheese like Yeb Yeb.  And Hunter summed up WYS perfectly as &quot;@#$%goty.&quot;  What ever happened to the days when LS could play a fight deck like Hidden Mains with an actual chance?  Duel defense helped in Tatooine, but the new Maul and Senate (not to mention racing, god forbid) make mains hopeless.  As a result, we&#146;re forced to play lame cheese like test-to-1, Gungans, and AFAs to win games.  You have taken the Epic out of Star Wars.  Please, fix it!<br>

Dear Decipher<br>
Cool game, but there are a few things I would like to point out. First, SLOW DOWN! Instead of making a couple of mediocre to bad sets (like Tat and Cor), take it slower and do one really good set. You are not engaged in a contest with Wizards to see who can bang out the most card sets in the shortest time. Take it easy and give our wallets time to recover as well. <br>
Second, PLEASE print some kind of silver bullet that kills Podracing completely. Maybe then people would stop using it, and the game would be much better off for it. Podracing is Not Fun But Incredibly Boring and the sooner this menace is wiped out, the better. Lets have some beefier LS Senators too hey? Make those debates a bit more interesting. I&#146;m a bit worried about this side deck idea too. My first thought was &quot;we&#146;re heading into Trek territory here. This is Bad.&quot; My second thought was &quot; Great. All you now have to do is fill it up with ten silver bullet objective killers and you&#146;ve got an answer for everything. There goes the game.&quot; Please renew my faith and show me that I&#146;m just being paranoid here. Keep up the otherwise excellent work.<br>

Now a days I am a big time player in my community and have won and come in second a few times in local tournements.  Now a days I hate the fact that the tournement scene has now been dominated by &quot;The Senate machine&quot; using Limited Resources and Defenisve Fire and stupid Lott Dod (I hate hime).  The only deck that can beat it is Watch your step! Which I think is the cheapest deck ever! Oh, I got two scrubs at a site? I get two destinys, six...six...CHEAP!  I like the good old days when Light side started with Obi-Wan&#146;s Hut, and Dark started with the death star and we liked it! We walked fifteen miles in the snow, bare foot, on sharp rocks, UP HILL BOTH WAYS just to get to our local comic book store!  hehe...sorry, it felt like it had to go in there. Anyways, I feel like something had been taken away from SWCCG, a certan kind of magic.  Anyways, stop breaking cards till they are stupid, stop making cards that cancel good cards...like this one card that cancels Weapon levatation! IT&#146;S A GOOD CARD!

Dear Decipher;<br>
<br>
Thanks for making a great game. I&#146;ll keep a set of SW:CCG before you added Episode I, and you&#146;ll see the rest on ebay in the near future. I appreciate that you used to be cool, but I will never buy another product with your name on it again. Less interactivity = less fun = fewer players = not actually more money for you like you wanted. Track those numbers around for awhile.<br>

Granted I don&#146;t hide behind podracing in my games, I aspire to be confrontational.  The Senate I feel is ridiculous too.  I havn&#146;t played against a DS senate deck yet but I see how terribly good these decks are on Decktech and I cringe.  <br>
<br>
The last time I quit this game was when Dagobah came out and every made stupid Dagobah Lightsaber Drain Decks where you couldn&#146;t do anything but sit back and get pissed on.  This a BATTLE game, aka we need to put the WAR back in Star Wars. <br>
<br>
Seeing some of the stuff in R3 is making me sad too because Decipher has introduced the Sideboard into Star Wars.  They have now found a way to be able to prevent certain stratagies without having to make room for it in your &quot;main deck&quot;.  Well it worked for Magic right?  Is this the best answer to solve problems?  Not really, I don&#146;t like the idea of lugging around another 11 card deck, Now I feel like a god damn Trek player ; )  The fact that they are doing this in a premium set too bothers me, how much of this jank do we really need to buy?  One and a half boxes of R2 and I was happy, had good mains and combos.  And now I&#146;m gonna pay 5 dollars a pack for Defensive Sheilds?  I know thats not the answer, but if Decipher can make a game where Senator Palpatine and Emperor Palpatine are in the same battle against each other, whats wrong with a sideboard?<br>

Also, even though a podrace may be more devestating than a duel, it requires more cards, does not take away one of your main characters, and there are many cards currently that weaken the strategy.  I hope you read what I wrote, and give others a chance to read it also.<br>
