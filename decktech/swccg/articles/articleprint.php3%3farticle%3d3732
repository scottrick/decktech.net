Well, more precisely, you want to compete in a tournament.  Allow me to provide you with a series of tasks you should consider doing in preparation.  Most people cannot throw decks together the night before and expect to do well.  For the 95% of us that aren&amp;#8217;t that good (or lucky), here&amp;#8217;s how to do it.<br>
<br>
There are really two places you can begin your preparations, deck construction or research.  Unless you already know precisely what decks you intend to play, I suggest you start with the later of the two.  I will touch on deck construction in brief, but it is not the focus of this article.  So we will begin with research.<br>
<br>
DO YOUR HOMEWORK<br>
<br>
By homework I mean research.  Go online, see what decks are out there.  This serves two purposes.  First, it may give you ideas for decks you might like to play, and second, it will allow you to see deck types you might have to face.  Make a list of popular deck types, highlight those that are popular in your area (if you know).  Examine these deck types in detail.  You need to learn how they work, their strengths, and their weaknesses.  If you have not already chosen your own decks, you can do comparisons between deck types until you find the ones that will give you the best chances for success against the decks you expect to play.  If you have already chosen your decks, take the opportunity to see how they measure up to other decks.  Can you rely on your strategy to beat theirs?  Can your deck still win if you never get your strategy rolling?  Would you be better off attempting to disrupt the strategy of the other deck?  You&amp;#8217;ll want to take all of this into consideration.  Eventually, you may want to formulate specific strategies you&amp;#8217;ll use when facing a specific deck type.<br>
<br>
KNOW YOUR CARDS<br>
<br>
Now that you have chosen and built your decks, you need to playtest.  Be very thorough on this part, because it is essential to learn your deck inside and out.  You ought to be able to name off at least 75% of the cards in it from memory.  Anytime you&amp;#8217;re looking through your reserve deck, by seeing what is there and what is in your hand, you should be able to account for at least half of your force pile.  Have you activated that key card you were looking for?  Only by playtesting and familiarizing yourself with your deck will you be able fine-tune it.  <br>
<br>
The repetition will be habit forming, so that when the time comes you can do exactly what you need to in order to get your deck up and running as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, the repeated practice will help you to eliminate mistakes from your game-play.  Take notes during your practice games.  Did you forget to force drain?  Or perhaps you forgot to search your reserve deck for a card BEFORE activating?  Write these things down so you will remember in the future.  <br>
<br>
FINAL PREPARATIONS<br>
<br>
So, you&amp;#8217;ve done your research, built your decks, and playtested the heck out of them.  What&amp;#8217;s left to do?  Wash, Rinse, Repeat.  Only this time, you&amp;#8217;re skipping general things and looking for specifics.  When you were looking for a deck type you did comparisons to see which decks offered you the greatest chances for success.  Now that you have built those decks, go back and check those matchups again.  You were making general comparisons before, now you need to look at details.  While you were comparing the overall effectiveness of strategies before, now you need to see how well your deck will PLAY against those strategies.  If they count on heavy retrieval, does shutting it down cripple them, or can they still fight effectively?  You built a force draining deck but the other one is faster; can you battle them into submission?  At this point you may want to write out specific strategies you&amp;#8217;ll use to defeat the decks you face, as mentioned earlier.<br>
<br>
Get a good night&amp;#8217;s sleep.  The night before the tournament is not the time to playtest, you should have already done it.  Make a few last minute changes to your decks if you feel you need to, but other than that let them be.  I will not dictate that X number of hours of sleep is best, only you can decide how much sleep you need.  But you will want to be well rested, as it allows for greater clarity of thought.  For some, well rested means 8 hours, for others, 4-5.  Its up to you.  I suggest you eat something the morning of, or at least take something with you.  This is not because I&amp;#8217;m telling you how to be healthy or anything, but simply because hunger can be a distraction.<br>
<br>
SOME FINAL SUGGESTIONS<br>
<br>
Take notes during your games, or between games if it takes you too long.  I have begun taking notes for all my sanctioned games; partially because I like to write tournament reports and partially because they help me to remember mistakes I made, so that I will not make them again.  I believe that writing a tournament report can be extremely helpful.  Before you next tournament, you can review previous TRs you have written to remind yourself of those critical mistakes you don&amp;#8217;t want to repeat.<br>
<br>
Talk to your opponents, especially the ones who beat you.  They can point out mistakes you made, or offer suggestions for improving your deck.  Most of the guys I have had the opportunity to play are very friendly and willing to help a new player improve his game.<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading, I hope you have found some of these suggestions useful.<br>
