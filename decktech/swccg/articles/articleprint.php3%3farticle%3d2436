Every game you play is different. You also receive oppurtunities to meet some really great people, particularly at tournaments. I have made connections with a lot of great people throughout my SWCCG history. Collecting is a blast because I love seeing cards I&#146;ve never seen before and getting my hands on hard-to-get rares. I often laugh on the occasion I draw a zero for battle or weapon destiny during a tournament game.<br>
<br>
Well, recently, I have noticed that the spirit of the game has been completely lost. Now people are cheating, tracking, and taking advantage of rules to do whatever they can to win. Yes, I too want to win, but I only enjoy winning when I used my deck that I designed and use my own strategy and played hard and honestly. Now, don&#146;t get me wrong, people who do things like track destiny aren&#146;t bad. I just personally thinks it ruins the concept of &quot;chance&quot; when drawing destiny. If I were a tournament director, I would not outlaw destiny tracking (even if I could), I just don&#146;t like the idea of tracking (I am learning how to do it, though...)<br>
<br>
The other part of the game that has been ruined is rarity. I work hard to get my Vaders and Lukes and I see people casually put three or four ultra-rares into their deck. Once again, don&#146;t get me wrong, I would do that too if I had them, but sometimes I feel so behind or low-class upon seeing people do that so casually. Sometimes I offer my relatively thick rare book to others to see if they want anything and they only want one or two cards. Or I&#146;ll try to get a card from someone else and offer up a good version of Vader or something and they will say something like, &quot;No, sorry, I already have three of those.&quot; I wonder if there is any thrill in opening packs for those people. I personally keep every common I obtain. In fact, at the last tourney, I watched a guy open a Death Star II pack and give all of the cards, including the rare, to my friend. I&#146;ve been made fun of for &quot;wasting&quot; so much money on cards but at least I keep what I pay for!<br>
<br>
Another pitiful aspect nowadays is attitude. I occasionally play guys who have virtually no sense of humor and just play the game to win and only to win. They never laugh, they keep a boring straight face, and always draw a seven for destiny. I commend those players for winning so well, but it&#146;s just a game! Enjoy it! Make it fun! Interact or something!<br>
<br>
Just as some closing words, I am not trying burn you guys up who have every set or play like an absolute professional. I&#146;m just saying, at least maintain a good attitude and have fun while playing. Heck, if your collections are so superior, chuck a rare to a newbie or two. Crack a joke, have fun, and meet the players around you. Do not turn into some card freak who hides in his cave plotting their attack and comes out on tournament day to squash the opponents. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
