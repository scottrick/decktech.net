<br>
after i left the cineplex and got home to eat something, i thought about the new Episode 2 film, the story<br>
and the &quot;new&quot; amazing charactesr.the first 30 minutes of the film was really wake, but then it started to get better <br>
and better, the young fett and his father were just 2 ruf guys, also the &quot;swinging&quot; yoda and never seen Count Dooku,<br>
then i started to think about SW:CCG what would happen if ....<br>
<br>
... decipher got the rights back for SW:CCG the first action will be the release of EP 2 with all the new ruf cards,<br>
Yoda Master Of The Force With Lightsaber, Boba Gett (add 2 dests if in battle with his father) or Conut Dooku <br>
(once during each of your turns may take one force lightning into hand) and then the best, Mace Windu With &quot;Purple&quot;<br>
Lightsaber, (add one dest if in battles with Bounty Hunters) it would be just amazing and i think this release would<br>
be one of the best ever. but what would be with anakin skywalker? light side or dark side, that&#146;s the question?<br>
maybe it will come a objective for light side, to keep anakin a jedi and for the dark side it will come a objective<br>
to cross anakin finally to the dark side *g*.<br>
<br>
Jengo Fett will be the new Bounty Hunter King, together with Ref 3 Fett he will just rule, and court will get <br>
also another push. but this will never happen (maybe in 20 years), it was just a small article about the new film and what<br>
would happen if decipher pulled out the Episode 2 cards.<br>
<br>
so if you&#146;re the same opionion pls tell me your ideas and characters, maybe decipher will release a virtual card set with all<br>
thise new cards (but without Cout Dooku,Jengo Fett and Anakin) it will be just cool and it will help to keep the good old <br>
SW:CCG alive, especially in Germany.<br>
<br>
