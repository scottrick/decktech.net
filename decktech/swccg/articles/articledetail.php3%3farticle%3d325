The principles this set was released on were that the packs were to give easier access to mains for beginners, enhance premiere (implicit in the title) and supplement the release of Special Edition (SE). Initial reaction to Han With Heavy Blaster Pistol was strong, and there was a small player outburst over the powerful nature of this card. Compared to what we'd seen pre-SE, he was a character like no other. With destiny adding ability, as well as his permanent weapon, he seemed to make previous versions of the Han persona obsolete. However, controversy over the EPPs died down when the other five were not as powerful and SE had cards that eclipsed anything the EPPs could come up with - objective cards, operatives, outer rim scouts, new Ben+Vader, etc. By the time Decipher had sorted out SE, EPPs had become accepted.<br>
<br>
So, how well do EPPs fulfil those initial criteria? They have given newer players a chance to get main characters easier than before, certainly the Luke/Vaders, but they have proved to be far far more use to the experienced players feeding on Han and Leia's abilities. Demand for these cards has been huge, and getting hold of them has been a problem - a criticism I would level at EPPs. The distribution was terrible. Several new players were encouraged to the game by EPPs, but perhaps not as many as Decipher had hoped. The tragedy of the 1998 World Championships, and following errata to operatives, refineries, spaceport speeders and hidden base, cast a shadow over the game that perhaps put them off. Certainly, the tournament scene was shaken up for a while before settling down to be better than ever before.<br>
<br>
'I think the cards do a lot for the new players getting into the game.... it's also changed the way Star Wars is played.... you're able to manage the cards in your deck more.... it's changed the whole game.' - Thad Chenoweth, World Finalist<br>
<br>
The name 'EPPs' is entirely misleading. For enhancing premiere, the set failed entirely. Jabba's Palace (JP) did far more to bring back those disused premiere cards than EPPs did. The concept perhaps was flawed to start with - what could Decipher have done in six character cards? The name, it turned out, was not claiming to enhance premiere but rather being used as an excuse for Decipher to peddle off Premiere it didn't want.<br>
<br>
'The idea of 'Enhanced' premiere is a joke...in fact EPPs make some premiere mains obsolete.' - Scott Latham, UK Top 10<br>
<br>
The game entered an entirely new stage with the combined release of SE and EPPs. The balance changed, and the level of efficiency available increased significantly. 'Its a different game since SE came along- the old deck balance ideas were thrown out with all the search engines that were in SE.' said John Shields, World Finalist '98. Whilst SE would dominate the immediate discussion - because of its size and radical card design - it is possible now to look back and see that EPPs would, in the long run, be equally as significant to the game. The precedent set with EPPs was for mains with enviable efficiency, unmatched by almost all other characters.<br>
<br>
'The worst thing about enhanced sets is that the cards totally dominate. They've made all the mains before them and after them obsolete. Decipher will never be able to make good mains again because of enhanced cards. All Han's are set up to the standard of EPP Han.' - YodaTuna, Webmaster of the Fishery<br>
<br>
So, what impact did EPPs have on the game? How strong were these cards? Of the six, Han and Leia would see the most tournament action (conversely being the hardest to get hold of). Because they were not only strong cards but also far superior to any other versions they became almost staple light side cards. Vader, Luke and Obi-Wan all held lightsabers and this powerful ability was put to use in many mains decks - although the lack of immunity to attrition would limit the use of Vader and Obi-Wan in particular. As time progressed, use of these EPPs diminished although Luke remained strong and is still the version all others are judged by. Boba Fett was good, but not quite in the same league perhaps as the others.<br>
<br>
One of my first criticisms of EPPs was the card distribution. It is worth noting here that Decipher are learning from that mistake. Not only is it clear in the future sets, where no ECC or EJP was rarer than any other, but Decipher have also recently announced that there will be EPP boxes available consisting of all Hans or all Leias - hoping to even up the deficit and shortage that has existed since November 1998. One of the themes I would like to pick up on this article is that Decipher have successfully learnt from previous enhanced sets, and this perhaps is most evident in this field.<br>
<br>
The principle criticism of EPPS however has to be their over-powered nature. The game was not used to this kind of introduction in 1998. Whilst SE might have overshadowed the EPPs back at the release, it is time now to analyse the EPPs alone. Reaching a conclusion is not easy, there are many factors to take into consideration and opinion is always divided. Whilst the EPPs have enhanced SWCCG gameplay, it can only be concluded that they were too powerful and set too dangerous a precedent for future incarnations not only of Luke/Vader/etc. but of all characters (take Orrimaarko or IG-88 for instance).<br>
<br>
'Enhanced Premiere Pack's came at a time when SW:CCG was in dire straits..... In my opinion, they were too powerful until the advent of Enhanced Cloud City.' - Michael Kessling, former Naboo+Dagobah No.1<br>
<br>
The concept of having mains with built-in weapons was not an inherently bad one. From the Cloud City (CC) expansion onwards, Decipher have noticeably tried to increase battling over force draining and 'cheese' (notice the number of anti-cheese cards from Torture to CHYBC). EPPs were a continuation of this good trend, which has been praised by the vast majority of the SWCCG community. Weapons were an under-used element of SWCCG, particularly when you consider the importance they play in the movies. However, given that a character already has a permanent weapon, does he really need to also have destiny enhancing ability? This element above all has created the super-efficiency of EPPs. Testimony to this truth is the popularity of the destiny adding EPPs. Whilst premiere Obi-Wan or SE Ben got plenty of use post-EPPs, the respective versions of Han never saw the light of day. EPPs were not, however, a bad concept, nor a bad product.<br>
<br>
The main characters are always popular with players, and Han, Leia and Fett were underused for their popularity and importance. EPPs breathed life back into them, at a time when they could have gone under in light of SE. They were strength to the game, but there were faults that have concerned players. These, however, would be combated in later sets...<br>
<br>
The EPPs were a standalone release, set apart from regular expansions. It was not expected that there would be further enhanced sets until the idea was mentioned on the unofficial website run by Ozymandias ('SW4GWLSW'). A review of the enhanced sets perhaps could not not be complete without mention to Mr. Andrew Marchand, who found out not only some proposed spoilers for a set entitled 'Enhanced Jabba's Palace' (EJP) but also the playtesters listserv. This started a buzz about the concept of EJP, which was kept going all the way until its actual release. The initial list held by Ozymandias is interesting to read, and seems to imply that ECC was not originally planned for. The card list was as follows:<br>
<br>
Swingers, Turn Out The Lights, Obi-Wan's Sanctuary, Together Again, Luke In Red 5 With R2-D2, Brea Tonnika, Senni Tonnika, Gangster's Paradise (Objective), Zuckuss With Snare Rifle<br>
Leia As Boushh, Mara Jade (The Emperor's Hand), Court of the Vile Gangster (Objective), Dengar In Punishing One, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle, Dengar With Modified Blaster Rifle, Battle Orders, Battle Plan<br>
<br>
As you can see, 9 cards made it and 9 cards didn't (although Obi-Wan's sanctuary turned into Any Methods Necessary - the similarity is astonishing). I will not post any more details of the 'rumoured' EJP set here, as we now know so much more of Decipher's plans as well as having assimilated the cards into gameplay, but the 'pre-release' and speculation provoked by Ozymandias is worthy of mention.<br>
<br>
However, we must not jump ahead of ourselves. For before ECC and EJP became confirmed and released, indeed before the World Championships of 1999, there was the follow-up expansion to SE - Endor. Whilst this article designed as a review of the enhanced set, a passing glance at the Endor set is necessary for context value.<br>
<br>
Following the game-changing SE, Endor was always set to be a contrast although the conservative nature of the set would come as a surprise - and disappointment - to most players. Following the number of abusive cards in SE - from operatives to outer rim scouts - Endor looked to keep things simple and not 'rock the boat' of SWCCG. This unfortunately meant that the pre-expansion lull that invariably arrives before a new expansion when players have grown tired of old decks and clamour for new ones, was not ended by Endor but extended.<br>
<br>
'Endor is as broken as Ommni Box and just as signifigant. They went out of thier way to give us a complete set with almost no tournament worthy cards at all. A complete waste of an expansion.' - David Akers, DeckTech<br>
<br>
There were only two new objectives, and the light side one in particular has seen almost no tournament action. Out of a 180-card expansion, only around 10 cards have seen regular action. Whilst the existence of Battle Order/Plan was perhaps as gamechanging as anything the enhanced sets have brought in, this was not particularly exciting and the lack of new strategies and interesting cards would not carry the players over until the next expansion - Death Star II. The Star Wars CCG community was not particularly pleased with Endor, so it seems it was a good idea for Decipher to confirm the existence of EJP - and announce that 'Enhanced Cloud City' (ECC) would precede it. Now, this was what the game needed.<br>
<br>
A major criticism of the EPPs had been the light side bias, which had brought that side out on top. To counterbalance this, the ECCs were 7-5 in favour of the Dark Side. Not only that, but the cards the DS were to gain would be far more impressive than anything to be found for the LS. The ECCs - on paper anyway - seemed to have corrected the faults found in the EPPs. The distribution is far better, with no pack hard to get hold of. Instead of one premium per pack we got three, and instead of entirely useless white-bordered premiere we got partially useful Cloud City. ECCs also 'enhanced' the set they were aimed at far far more than EPPs ever did. The number of Cloud City cards being used rose dramatically after its release - from Dark Deal decks to Sabacc Decks and from Clouds Decks to Bounty Hunting! Thus, Decipher deserve praise for their realisation over the errors of EPPs and for listening to the views of the playing community.<br>
<br>
ECCs were first premiered in Germany, but more prolifically at the World Championships 1999 - an event that would prove far more successful than the previous year. The overall reaction was the same from the worlds top players, who saw the dark side as regaining their crown. Martin Akkesson, world finalist, said 'I can't imagine how the light side will stand a chance on the ground now.' and Paul Feldman claimed 'The dark side is now stronger than the light side.' However, for most players the power of dark ECCs only balanced what had previously been an unfair light side balance.<br>
<br>
'From what I've seen, the dark side is overly powerful compared to what the light side has got... it'll even it up.' - Clayton Atkin, World Finalist<br>
<br>
So, what did the dark side get in ECC? Most notably for most were the two starships and two characters. These all dealt with countering currently over-powered light side strategies (e.g. Hidden Base) whilst also encouraging under-used dark side ones (e.g. bounty hunting). The cards also took popular characters - such as Boba Fett or Dengar - which had previously had game personas far weaker than most players (and fans) would have desired, and turned them into tournament worthy cards. Whilst Dengar in Punishing One was a Hidden Base counter, he served as far more than that, being assimilated into several deck types. Boba Fett in Slave I was the first of the enhanced trade-offs - whilst a useful ship, his ground persona was also becoming increasingly useful. So, deck efficiency was called into question in a different way to normal. Instead of Boba Fett vs Another Character we had Boba Fett vs Boba Fett! The characters were both droids, but both very powerful. 'They are some cool cards.' said Bastian Winkelhaus,<br>
World Finalist. The objective, This Deal, is a well crafted one. It can compete with any light side strategy but by no means made obsolete any other dark side strategy. That shows skilled game design, so again kudos to Decipher. Crush The Rebellion was a blatant attempt to curb the popularity of Nudj-Revo decks - and it worked. It also enhanced Hunt Down, which was a decktype that really didn't need much enhancing. Many players have seen its most powerful effect as being anti-Clash - a card that had often swung games as the 'ultimate beatdown card for the light side' - Mike Fitzgerald. The final card, Any Methods Necessary, wass the first premium starting interrupt and encouraged bounty hunting.<br>
<br>
'The classic scenario of Star Wars, in which the Light Side's main characters hide indoors while the Dark Side's Walkers wreak havoc outdoors, has changed. With Enhanced Cloud City, the Dark Side finally has enough firepower to come indoors and stand up with those pesky Enhanced Premiere Pack cards they've dreaded.' - Joe Alread, World Top 100<br>
<br>
The light side, by comparison, came away with little benefit. A new Chewie - and this time he's armed - promised hope but most of us came to the same conclusions as Steve Horton of SCRYE - 'My recommendation: stick with premiere Chewie.' The ECC Lando was better - a character who had not had a CCG card equal to his role in the film - with not only a weapon but the crucial destiny adders (which made the EPPs so powerful). His power, however, was curbed by two factors - his inflexibility away from Cloud City and the trade-off (the second so far) with Lando In Falcon. This was an interesting choice for the light side, but not as powerful a choice as the dark side enjoyed. Quiet Mining Colony, whilst appearing to be potentially devastating, is not as potent as first impressions might mislead you into thinking.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, because the 0-destiny side is so restricting to your drains and ability to play, QMC decks have not seen as much popularity as I originally hoped and the strategy has not truly been a competitive rival to Hidden Base or Tatooine Mains+Toys. In fact, it has found as much popularity as decks such as Rescue The Princess and really has had limited success. The Z-95 Headhunter, whilst far superior to the previous incarnation, was a little too specific to Bespin to see widespread use in the same way as the Dark Sides new starships or even Lando In Falcon.<br>
<br>
The amount of card discussion that could be done on the ECCs is huge. However, I wish to keep this article below 5000 words. There are some good discussion articles out there however; I suggest the archives of DeckTech or Trandosite as further reading. The basic summary of ECC is that the set balanced the game back to a more equal status, perhaps with the dark side a little in front but most players have indicated that this is their preference. The cards were not as over-powered as EPPs. In fact, the strongest was possibly Dengar In Punishing One which is nothing compared to Han EPP. Whilst they were strong, I see ECC as a positive expansion which looked to combat over-powerful strategies and bring equality to the game. Decipher also combated the problems of card distribution and availability found in EPPs, and lack of new strategy found in Endor.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Decipher decided to release EJP just two months after ECC. This didn't give us much chance to get used to the ECC cards on their own, and Cloud City decks are now back on the decline. ECC has had some long term effects on the popularity of Cloud City, but the effects will be diminshed as EJP becomes further integrated into the playing collective.<br>
<br>
To the surprise of the playing community instead of a 6-6 balance between light and dark EJP had an even larger bias to the dark side of 8-4. Not only that, but the dark side had two new characters with permanent weapons (whereas the light side had none).<br>
<br>
'They're really good cards as far as gameplay but I don't like the way every new card is having a built-in weapon and this guy adds destiny with this guy, I don't really like the way that's going. That takes away from card efficiency.' - Clint Hays, World Finalist<br>
<br>
Not only did the dark sides permanent weapon force increase, but the other six cards also proved to be powerful - even more powerful in fact. Top of the list has to be Mara Jade. She came complete with a lightsaber, making her almost as potent as having a permanent weapon. Decipher released the card image on the web, along with some comments from Justin Pakes, their rules guru.<br>
<br>
'Let's face some facts here. Mara's game text box could say 'This space left intentionally blank' and she would still be worthy of inclusion in most decks on statistics alone.' - Justin Pakes, Decipher<br>
<br>
How many characters could this be said of? Mara is powerful, and her gametext enhances that only further. Not only does she again enhance Hunt Down but she is a main character who can rival Vader for efficiency value. Whilst it can be argued that the dark side needed this, the light side would not benefit anyone along this line. Jodo Kast was perhaps the weakest of the characters, although his game text not only weakened EPPs further for the light side but made weapons more efficient.<br>
<br>
The starships were interesting. Zuckuss In Mist Hunter has attracted huge insults from light side players. His game text is far too over-powered, making light side space a daunting deck to attempt. IG in IG2000 is also powerful, although his lack of ability will probably more often than not be a bane rather than a benefit (I may be proved wrong on that). Both starships were extremely powerful; the efficiency of having starships with permanent pilots such as these cannot be under-estimated. The ability to add a pilot should not be under-estimated either. These cards are powerful, so make no mistake. The objective Court of a Vile Gangster is, for me, much along the same lines as This Deal. It can compete against the light side (perhaps not as well as the ECC objective) but does not place other strategies out of play. What's more, the deck base is very flexible and the start could be used for a multitude of decktypes, along the lines of Hidden Base for the light side. Mains and toys could do worse than start with it, getting a good 5-2 activation ratio and the text of the audience chamber is not to be ignored.<br>
<br>
'I think it will change the dark side strategy at the moment, aliens will come back.... that's a good thing.' - Gary Carman, World Champion<br>
<br>
The dark side again had trade-offs which limits the power of these cards more than you might appreciate. Sure, the dark side has got IG on the ground and in space - but he can only be in one place or the other! Thus, if you pack all the characters where this trade off exists you will be severely limiting your ability to play the game with any level of flexibility. This is perhaps the biggest point of game strategy to be discussed in this article. Bossk With Mortar Gun may seem an attrative character, capable of capturing, but had he not have been Bossk he would have been far better. As it is, the trade-off for Bossk In Hound's Tooth is too great for most players to pack the ground version and the same can be said of Dengar and Zuckuss.<br>
<br>
Even Mara Jade is easy to over-estimate. Whilst undoubtedly a powerful character, this may lead players to become over-confident. And this, as the Emperor told us, can be a weakness. Whilst Chuck Sonnenburg is certainly right when he wrote 'I definately think that Mara Jade is shaking up this game in a very great way.' in his DeckTech article 'The Deadly Mara Jade' it is also worth considering that she is not undefeatable. Few mains can be so easily destroyed. Firstly, I am increasingly seeing players leave her by herself or with a minor character (asking for a Clash of Sabers). Just two or three EPPs will take care of her, and inflict some serious damage. Secondly, many light side decks already pack spies and the ease of Double Agent makes Mara a more risky character than many may give credit for. However, all things concluded, she is ridiculously overpowered. She will have the biggest impact on the game by far than any other EJP or ECC.<br>
<br>
'Other than that [Mara Jade] I don't see the game changing a whole lot' - Ray Bordier [of enhanced sets], World Finalist<br>
<br>
So, how does the light side come out? With three characters and one objective, the potential is huge yet the reality is dismally disappointing. See Threepio barely deserves a mention. His deployment restriction is so specific it makes him useless in 98% of light side decks. Such a limited card can in no way compare to a card like Jodo Kast. Boushh might appear better - and indeed she is - but even her influence will be limited. As a Leia persona, I cannot help but feel that other versions will take precedent whether it be Daughter of Skywalker (popular in training decks) or EPP Leia (popular in all other decks). Her game text is not as astonishing as I first believed. Finally, Master Luke. Now, finally we have a light side character worth discussing! Whilst still inferior to EPP Luke in most ways, this character does have some benefits. His stats of 6-5 are impressive, combined with useful immunity to attrition which has always been the weakness of EPP Luke. Most notably of all, of course, is his ability to return aliens to the opponents hand. This is on par with Vaders choke, although not as powerful in most situations. The restriction to aliens also makes it less potent - the dark side player is unlikely to deploy to you with low ability aliens at the risk of having them returned. Master Luke also suffers from a massive deploy cost of 7. Whilst cheaper to Tatooine this lessens his efficiency and in a game increasingly dominated by efficiency this may mean he hits the trades files more than the table.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the light side objective does not have much to say for itself. By letting the opponent into the Audience Chamber at the start you'll make it hard from yourself at the start. The benefits will rarely outweigh the difficulties. Whilst the flip side encourages mains, I feel that most players will prefer (rightly) to stick instead to a more classic start - Yavin IV throne room or Obi's Hut Careful Planning. Norman Horn, in his excellent articles reviewing enhanced objectives, said of You Will Either Profit From This - 'I will honestly say that this objective is probably not the best for the tournament scene at the moment. Currently the Dark Side has the Light on the run from all the new and powerful Bounty Hunter ships and the new personas of the hunters themselves. There are too many variables involved to effectively combat enough Dark decks to be competitive in the current tournament scene.' Even a player who has grasped the enhanced sets as well as Mr. Horn admits this objective is flawed, and not tournament worthy.<br>
<br>
So, what can we conclude other than that the dark side has come out of ECC and EJP better off than the light side? I have yet to meet any player who does not concur with this opinion of the recent enhanced sets.<br>
<br>
'I think that with each expansion the hand of power sways from one side to the other. When EPP came out it was LS, ECC moved it into balance, and EJP, seems to be swaying the pendulum towards the almighty Dark Side.' - Michael Kessling<br>
<br>
Not only do the dark side gain more cards, but the cards themselves are far superior. Crush The Rebellion, Dengar In Punishing One, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter and 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle are some of the key cards in weakening light side strategies. They take away from of the strengths of the old light side decks, whether it be swarming or force choke. The old powerful EPPs are meeting their match - the dark side has 'effectively now got an EPP dark side hit squad' - Gary Carman - with IG, Dengar, Mara Jade, etc. Also, the light side are weakened by cards such as 4-LOM. This combination of factors bodes badly for the Alliance.<br>
<br>
The over-powerful nature of all enhanced sets is perhaps the worst element of them, although conversely were they less powerful and less tournament worthy Deciper's motive for making them would not be great enough as demand would fall significantly. Look at Endor for proof of this; demand for Endor has now fallen to almost nill being far outsold by Reflections and Special Edition. The dark side bias has also been a negative element of enhanced sets.<br>
<br>
There are, however, many positive factors to enhanced sets and I strongly believe that overall these sets have been good for the game and enjoyable for the player. Firstly, they have let new players get easier access to main characters and powerful cards - most notable in EPPs although this theme can still be applied to ECC/EJP. They've also made character cards more efficient (although this could just as easily be cited as a negative effect - 'It makes deckbuilding easier..it takes away from skill.' said Clint Hays). The cards are good cards too, and certainly tournament worthy, adding exciting new dimensions to the gameplay environment - most players enjoy using bounty hunters and the like that has been spawned from these sets. The more recent sets have truly 'enhanced' older expansions, and the rise in Cloud City and Jabba's Palace decks is testimony to that. The new objectives have, to varying degrees, provided new and interesting deck styles and strategies. Previously underused yet popular characters are<br>
seeing the action they deserve - from Lando to Boba Fett and even Han and Chewie! Abusive strategies, such as Nudj-Revo, have been combated. Whilst the increased efficiency of cards makes deck building easier on the one hand, on the other the trade-offs mentioned througout this article help to counter this to some extent. Enhancesd sets have also helped to introduce battle back into the game, further building on the themes seen in sets such as Endor.<br>
<br>
'The enhanced expansions have a heavy emphasis on very strong characters and starships. This has the effect of moving the environment towards battle-orientated decks. Decks that rely on fast drains become much more vulnerable to battle and beatdown, reducing their tournament viability.' - Nick Rice, UK Top 10<br>
<br>
Enhanced sets have enhanced the game of SWCCG. And primarily for the better. The over powered nature of the dark side since EJP was a mistake, but one that can easily be corrected in forthcoming expansions such as Death Star II. The over powered nature of the whole sets, however, is a longer term problem. The trend is for increasing power and efficiency at the expense of previous sets - but perhaps Reflections will help to tame this beast as well.<br>
<br>
A question many people are asking of enhanced sets is 'Will there be any more?'. Most people would reply no, and Decipher have not unveild plans for any as such, but I would warn players to be wary of this attitude. The Third Anthology beckons with six premium cards which are not to appear outside the set (sound familiar?). There's no reason to believe permanent weapon characters will not be appearing in future expansions (Death Star II lends itself particularly to characters in ships). Decipher have announced plans for 'Mini-Hoth' sets and 'Character Sets' both of which are quite possibly to feature cards like we have seen in enhanced sets. Analyse of the future, of course, is nigh-on impossible but we must think that EJP will not see the end of this type of set.<br>
<br>
And finally....<br>
<br>
'One question remains: Why not include those cards in a 'normal' expansions.......?' - Markus Wuest, German Top 10<br>
<br>
Whilst it would be naieve of me to presume anything other than profit incentives for Decipher as to the primary motive for why these sets were produced, I like to look on a more positive side for this. The sets have come at a necessary time, providing a good link between Endor and Death Star II. This was a time when otherwise decks would have become too boring and enthusiasm would have waned to possibly an all-time low. They provide a good break between expansions, and have certainly given the SWCCG community plenty to talk about.<br>
<br>
Have enhanced sets been too powerful? Yes. Have they disrupted the equilibrium of the game? Yes. Have they set too high standards for future expansions? Yes. However, they have also provided new and exciting cards to the game and in this respect they have been a success. I will leave you to draw your own conclusions from the facts; my belief is that enhanced sets have; on balance; been good for the game and have improved from set to set.<br>
<br>
I hope in this article I have drawn your attention to the main points to be discussed over the enhanced sets, undoubtely one of the biggest influences on the game of SWCCG in its history.<br>
