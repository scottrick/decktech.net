<br>
The concept - The concept of manipulation in my opinion is to harass the opponent enough into where you mess with their thought pattern and they make a fatal mistake that you exploit to win the game. Manipulation is one of the few decks that is meant to beat the opponent, not the opponent's deck.<br>
In this article I'll examine the Light Side's means of<br>
manipulation on the opponent ( i.e. not Tunnel Vision or<br>
 self manipulating cards like How Did We Get Into This Mess ) ;<br>
<br>
a.) Hidden Base - I feel I need to explain a bit of this<br>
choice here. First I see this as a manipulative deck<br>
because the force you expend to probe for the Hidden Base<br>
and the pay 1 to draw 1 concept. Anyone who hasn't found<br>
the Hidden Base fast enough knows that those 'probe' cards<br>
are just as effective if not more so then force drains of 1. Also , in 90% of dark decks you HAVE to probe the Hidden Base to win the game.<br>
<br>
b.) Oola - The green Twi'lek with a plan. This little lady<br>
with enough force will turn the opponent's fighting force<br>
into the Used Pile. Oola is a very underrated card and is<br>
a nice endgame lockdown. Grimtaash keeps their hand size<br>
down. In conjunction with Civil Disorder and/or Revolutions<br>
can end a game really quickly.<br>
<br>
c.) Shasa Tiel - The big green head Harc Seff. Shasa is<br>
very tough by using 3 force to re-arrange the opponent's<br>
forcepile. Shasa helps to know what is coming up soon and<br>
can be used to set up Grimtaash or Visored Visions.<br>
<br>
d.) Grimtaash - This little blue killer helps keep the<br>
opponent's hand size down and at somewhat of a reasonable<br>
 size for Oola. Clears out doubles that could be setup by<br>
Shasa Tiel or in the later game Oola herself.<br>
<br>
e.) Recoil in Fear - Ah the Dagobah set. This destiny 3 Lost<br>
Interrupt allows you to use 3 force to have both players<br>
 count their hands , put them back into reserve , and draw a<br>
 new hand. This card is particularly good in the beginning<br>
if you have a bad hand or in the endgame when you know the<br>
opponent is only holding on to the really key cards.<br>
<br>
f.) Stone Pile - This card can be devastating thought it<br>
probably hasn't been seen much since Dagobah Drain decks.<br>
This card randomly selects 2 cards from the opponent's hand<br>
and effectively buries them. Playing this card in the<br>
endgame or after a few big force drains can change the<br>
opponent's mood in a hurry.<br>
<br>
g.) Perimeter Scan - This card basically allows you to look<br>
 at the opponent's hand and if your lucky you'll get to move<br>
 U-3PO or Probe droids away.<br>
<br>
h.) Battle Plan - This card can have a very powerful effect<br>
on the opponent. They either setup a space and ground drain<br>
or they pay 3 per drain. The 3 can help you get a nice card<br>
advantage and keep their hand size and thus efficiency down.<br>
<br>
i.) Draw Their Fire - One of the less obvious manipulation<br>
cards but very important. The opponent has to save a force<br>
for any effective Interrupt that they plan to play. If they<br>
 have a good battle deck they'll have to save 3-4 force a<br>
turn just to feel save from things like EPPs or say Eloms.<br>
<br>
j.) Never Tell Me The Odds/ Anger Fear Aggression - These<br>
insert cards can affect how much force the opponent activates<br>
 for a few turns while they try to find their counter cards<br>
 ( if any ).<br>
<br>
k.) Revolution - One of the deadlier Manipulation cards.<br>
This card spins around a location and restricts the access<br>
of cards the opponent can activate. This card fits well with<br>
 Civil Disorder or any other cards that force the opponent<br>
to do X or lose Y force.<br>
<br>
l.) Beggar - For 3 force you can to slowly mess with the<br>
opponent's force pile every turn for one card or shoot his<br>
whole stack back before he can slam you. Suddenly the Empire's<br>
 funding for the Executor was cut for 4 Medium Bulk Freighters.<br>
<br>
m.)  Frozen Assets - One of the more obviously manip cards.<br>
This card allows you to put a lock down on the opponent's<br>
force. They can't access the cards under it for a turn or<br>
so. Also stops the opponent from drawing out of a bad<br>
situation.<br>
<br>
n.) Sensor Panel / Radar Scanner - This little combo can be<br>
attached to your Swoop , Lift Tube ,X-Wing , or Speeder Bike<br>
to get rid of any nasty Interrupts or effects like Security<br>
Precautions , Monnok ,Counter Assault , or Shocking Revelation.<br>
<br>
o.) Visored Vision - This card will slowly chip away at the<br>
opponent for each interrupt that happens to rotate through<br>
their Used Pile.<br>
<br>
p.) Wars Not Make One Great - This card also makes the<br>
opponent play 1 more force per force drain or battle and<br>
will slowly add up especially if used with Battle Plan.<br>
<br>
q.) Rescue the Princess (flipped) - When flipped RTP makes<br>
them pay an extra force to force drain. Small like WNMOGreat<br>
but when your gonna come and place their fighting force<br>
outta play they'll want to get as many possible cards into<br>
their hand.<br>
<br>
Well these are all the means that I can think of right now<br>
that the lightside has to manipulate the darkside. When used<br>
in conjunction with Civil Disorder or cards that make them<br>
do X or lose Y force ( Order to Engage ) you'll see that<br>
though Lightside Manipulation isn't as popular as Darkside<br>
Manipulation but the potential is there. Next article : Dark<br>
Side means of Manipulation.<br>
