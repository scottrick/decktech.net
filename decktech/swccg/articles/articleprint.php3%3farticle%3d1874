<br>
1.  Arrive early.  The tournament starts at 11am, so plan to be there around 10:30 or so to complete your command card and to pay the $5 registration.	If you do not know how to get there, check the Decipher Website for the store&#146;s address and phone number.	They will give directions to you from all points!!  On a related note:	check radio and AAA updates if you are travelling.  You can find out about any accidents/construction and make a detour rather than get stuck.<br>
<br>
2.  Count your decks and make all your card choices before you arrive.	If you wait to the last minute or build it in the car, you may forget a key card to your deck.	Decklists are not required, but I do expect that everyone will be courteous and offer to have their opponent count their decks.  If there are any concerns about anything raise them at that time during the game, not after the game.<br>
<br>
3.  Many tournaments may be going on in the store at that time.  Please be courteous around all players regardless of their game.  Also, I will corral folks from the SWCCG playing area after they finish to avoid scouting accusations.<br>
<br>
4.  Sportsmanship.  I will not have an elaborate system of warnings and conseqences like Mr. Girard.  I reserve the right to forfeit any game or disqualify any player for disrespectful or disruptive behavior, as well as any infractions on the published tournament and gameplay rules and regulation.<br>
<br>
5.  Regarding Decks:  No opaque (black,green,red, etc) backs will be permitted.  Decklists are not required.  Any blacked out (face) or marked cards (backs) will need to be replaced.	Signed cards are fine as long as the text,lore, and vital stats are readable.<br>
<br>
6.  Watch your deck boxes and trade binders.  I will not assume responsibility for these items.  Lock them in your car or keep them in your backpack near you while you play.<br>
<br>
7.  Have fun!!<br>
<br>
Of course, these guidelines can apply for any tournament, but I wanted to make them public before the great event!!<br>
<br>
I hope to see many of you soon!!!<br>
