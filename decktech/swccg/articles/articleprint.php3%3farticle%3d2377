I just recently went to the DPC in Las Vegas (6-2 missed on differential) and went to the California State Championships (lucky to win that one) and thought of how much the player quality has improved over the years.  I really believe DechTech has been responsible for helping many people&#146;s game, and that is cool!  No one can guarentee victory anymore, NO ONE!  Too many good players out there.<br>
<br>
Now to some of the tricks.  I was sitting with Jason Makohon and Eric Bruen and talking about California States.  Jason, a great deck builder, made some comments about how I set people up.   On the way home, I thought about those comments.  And it is true, I use a lot of my opponent to win my games.  I thought it would be fun to write an article on the reason I have been pretty successful with the game.<br>
<br>
1st: You need to track your destiny.  That is a no brainer.  Everyone knows that.   You need to practice with Traffic Control or Used Interrupts.  Things like Surprise Assault will save you a game.  Trust me.<br>
<br>
2nd: You need to play cards your opponent has no idea you would be playing.  Example.  In my HB deck, I run no docking bays.  However, I run a Fallen Portal and a WEB droid that cancels Lateral Damage.  Why? Because almost every game I have played, I have seen a docking bay.  And to hold ground with a Space Deck, you need tricks.<br>
<br>
3rd: Know your area.  After a major tournament, I know that most people play the winner&#146;s decks.  Brian Hunter and Clint Hays post their stuff and people love to use them.  That is great for you.  Put some counters to those decks in your deck and you will be guarenteed to see the decks of the champs!<br>
<br>
4th: Bring back the old.  Decks go in cycles.  People play key cards and Decipher makes cards to counter those cards.  Decks fall apart and people forget to put in the counters.  Example: Goo Nee Tay and Shocking Information was played in almost every deck.  Now, many decks have lost those cards.  Playing one M&#146;iiyoom Onith with a Set Your Course deck crushes.  Trust me.  I am somewhat retired from the game and have only played in 3 tournaments in the past 4 months (Enduro, DPC, and California States) and I won two of the tournaments and came close to the final four in DPC with the Onith trick!<br>
<br>
5th: Create the new.  Always look for the new broken card.  Revolution/Beggars or Drazin or Sense/Alters shuffle or Feldman&#146;s Dagobah (named by Kyle Heuer from Decipher)were decks back in the day that were close to being broken that I took to major tournaments.  They weren&#146;t unbeatable, but the decks were relatively unknown or unseen and people had a very hard time combating them.  So much that Decipher created cards to stop them when the decks went out of control or were improved upon to make even more dangerous.  There are so many cards out there, it is impossible to counter every strategy.  The unseen is really powerful!<br>
<br>
Well, that&#146;s all the tricks I have.  Nothing up my sleeve anymore :)  I been around from the beginning.  I have seen great players leave (Kevin Reitzal, etc.). I have seen great players fall from being great.  I have seen new players emerge on the seen and become great (Clint Hays and Brian Hunter and Kevin Shannon).  I call them new since they weren&#146;t there in very beginning.  Brian Hunter is incredible.  I remember taking #1 in the World back in the day, but I lost it 3 times and then never recovered #1 in the World again.  Brian Hunter has never lost it.  He is truly a great player.  And I have watched the really good become the best (Yannick Lapointe).  I remember Yannick when he was at World&#146;s #2.  I beat him pretty good.  Then I met him at World&#146;s #5 and he beat me badly.  He, in my opinion, is the best player in the World right now!  Man, I am the dinasour of the game.  This was a fun trip.  I was here in the beginning, but even though I won a bye to my 5th Worlds, I probably won&#146;t be here in the end!  Good luck players.  Fun playing the game with you!<br>
