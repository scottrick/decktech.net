He must acquire an extensive collection of cards, develop the ability to construct decks that allow him a chance to win, and finally attain the play skills necessary to win with the tools he has.  Any newbie getting into the game now is at a severe card disadvantage, yet it is clear that since the release of Jabba's Palace, Decipher has been making it easier for a new player to accomplish the other two goals.	The perfect model for this argument is X-Wings.<br>
<br>
A new player doesn't have many cards, and probably very few rares compared to most of us.  Look at your decks sometime and take note of the fact that many of them contain 40+ rares, more than you would get buying an entire box of cards.  If it were necessary for any somewhat competitive deck to contain this many rares (let alone the multiples of mains, or 13+ ORS that you find in some decks) new players would have very little chance of accumulating the tools to make a winning deck before constant defeat caused them to be disheartened and quit.	Fortunately, there is one thing newbies can get in abundance: white border commons.  Commons of any sort, really, are practically thrown away by the vets after they open the prize support, making it easy for newbies to get them.  As it turns out, a newbie is better off with those commons than he would be with any main character.  While the principle I'm going to discuss applies to any number of decks based around multiples of non-uniques, I'll choose X-Wings because they are often the card that newbies do in fact choose to use for their first attempts at building a competitive deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
GREAT WARRIOR: Efficiency<br>
<br>
X-Wings, like many non-uniques, are a great asset to the deck they appear in due to their very high level of efficiency.  On one level, the card itself is highly efficient in comparison to its counterparts.	Which player is further along in his development, one using non-unique X-Wings or one using his RyleTorsyn/Gold3 combo?  Deciding to use the non-unique demonstrates that the newbie has already learned a simple lesson about card efficiency: pilot + ship = 2 cards, pilot w/ship = 1 card.	Once the decision to use the non-unique is made, there are further ways for a newbie to learn about maximizing efficiency, in the form of the various interrupts/effects that support this strategy.  Those cards, released beginning with Jabba's Palace, have made it easy for newbies to develop a variety of play skills they will need to develop higher level decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
A JEDI'S STRENGTH: Battle Skills<br>
<br>
S-Foils makes it possible for X-Wings to be very powerful battlers.  Beatdowns in space with reduced deploy X-Wings are possibly the least rare-intensive way to do major damage to the opponent.  On the other hand, the deck format allows experimentation with 'reacts', both to and away from a battle.  The power, and the risks, of using 'reacts' is a must-learn for new players...a lesson they can't learn by throwing a few random mains into their fledgling tourney deck.  Here again, the learning curve and the 'card collection' curve coincide.<br>
<br>
<br>
DOMAIN OF EVIL: Countermeasures<br>
<br>
Rebel Fleet makes an X-Wing both a battler, a force-drainer, and a force-drain blocker.  X-Wings are deployed to form fighting forces in space, preventing the opponent from draining there.  By placing them on Rebel Fleet before deployment, ground drains are also cancelled, killing two birds with one stone without the need to deviate from your gameplan.  How many times have you looked through a newbie's deck after you blew him out, trying to give him some pointers, and found that he had no ability to neutralize the opponent's gameplan without abandoning his own.  Getting each card to fulfill as many roles as possible, both offensive and defensive, is a deckbuilding principle that newbies need to learn to be competitive.<br>
<br>
<br>
SIZE MATTERS NOT: Tracking Destinies, Turning Around Games<br>
<br>
An opponent's deck can look alot bigger than yours in the middle of a game, and that does not mean all is lost.  Veterans know this, but many newbies simply give up in the middle of a game.	All Wings Report In, another card that adds yet another funcion to an X-Wing, is a good way for a newbie to develop the skills that can turn a game in your favor when things look their darkest.  First, it retrieves cards...ALOT of cards in some cases, enough to bridge the gap with the opponent.  Secondly, if you retrieve 10 cards with AWRI, you now know exactly where in your life force 12 specific cards are, 10 retrieved plus the AWRI plus the destiny you drew for it.  With considerably little effort, any high destinies in that group can be tracked and used for weapon destinies, battle destinies, On the Edge, etc.  The ability to track destinies for key game actions, made very easy by All Wings (as well as Nar-Shaada, SRF, Abyssin Ornament,) will instantly make a newbie competitive with low to moderately-skilled vets.<br>
<br>
By now you may be saying, &quot;Well, you have made the case for the strengths of HBX, but why can't a newbie simply build mains decks and use the counterparts to the tools you've mentioned sofar?&quot;  The answer is in simplicity.<br>
<br>
<br>
IT IS THE FUTURE YOU SEE: Anticipation, Archetype Recognition, and the Unknown<br>
<br>
Playing an X-Wing swarm is relatively easy.  After awhile, it almost plays itself.  By playing a simple drop-n-fight deck, using one very simple card to do most of your fighting, you can focus on what the opponent is doing.  When your own deck requires less of your attention, you can focus your mind on what the skilled player sitting across from you is doing.  A newbie using such a deck can begin to recognize deck types, anticipate possible plays by the opponent, and pick up on tricks he hasn't seen before.  A wise man listens twice as often as he speaks, but alot of newbies use decks that have so much going on in them that they ignore the lessons they could be learning.<br>
<br>
A newbie has no business playing Throne Room Mains or Hunt Down.  Those decks, decks that are balanced and rely on flexibility and cunning play skill for their victories, cannot be played successfully without first having learned to maximize card efficiency, respond to the opponent's plan, anticipate his likely responses to you, and track destinies.  Yet it seems that a threat to this learning process lies on the horizon...<br>
<br>
<br>
YOU MUST CONFRONT VADER: Bad News for Newbies<br>
<br>
It may be preliminary, but we've seen enough of the key Death Star II cards to see what the landscape of SWCCG's future may be like.	There are cards in there that specifically punish a player for not using Vader or Luke.  The card Your Destiny, for instance, is like an uncancellable FD+3 for the Dark side when Luke isn't at a battleground.  While this punishes the opponent for hiding Luke away somewhere, it also punishes opponents WHO DON'T HAVE LUKE IN THEIR DECK.  For D*2-generation newbies, this is a character made available as an ULTRA-RARE!  It's ludicrous to punish newbies for their lack of a large collection in this manner, especially since they are already at a serious disadvantage.  This sort of card tells newbies two things:<br>
<br>
1.  If you don't have a Luke or Vader, main characters that it may be costly or time-consuming (through trades) to acquire, your opponent can exploit this to cause you massive force loss.  It doesn't matter what kind of deck you play, if Luke or Vader isn't in there you'll be losing some extra force.<br>
<br>
2.  Every good, winning deck must include mains.  Sure, veterans will realize that the force loss on Your Destiny is just compensation for the fact that against a Luke-less deck your entire objective is pointless.  A newbie won't see that, he'll just see that he keeps losing force and can't do anything about it.  This will cause many new players to do away with creativity entirely, assuming that Luke-less decks will always be at a huge disadvantage.<br>
<br>
This emphasis on mains, along with new cards such as the admiral's order that cripples ships without pilot characters, may hurt a newbie's chances of finding a simple deck they can use to hone skills and learn strategies.  Decipher had been getting it right lately, but the things we've seen from D*2 may erode all they've done to make it easier for newbies to compete and grow as players.<br>
