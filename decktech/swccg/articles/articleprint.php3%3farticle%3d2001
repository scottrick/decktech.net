Here are some of my examples...<br>
1. Grimtaash/Monnok.  When I see my opponent has activated lots of force and begins to draw a large chunk of it, I ask them how many cards are in their hand.  I do this before they reach 13 cards so that they have the opportunity to stop drawing.	That is my goal.  To make them stop drawing cards even though they should and I have no Grimtaash/Monnok.  Sometimes I even look at my hand and shuffle a card to the front (and count my force pile) to make them think I have Grimtaash/Monnok ready to go.  This is one mind game that I use frequently and it often works.<br>
<br>
2.  Ability.  Sometimes when I have no cards to work with in hand and my opponent deploys a single card like an x-wing or something small, I will ask him how much ability it has or how much power.  I do this to make him think I am contemplating battling against that card and try to make him<br>
commit more troops or consolidate his forces.  This works best against swarm decks that spread thin to drain.  If you ask power and ability at some of their weakest positions sometimes they will abandon them in order to protect<br>
themselves.  Versus an x-wing swarm deck I ask what the power is of a single x-wing and sometimes my opponent will move it away from a potentially damaging force drain.  Even in the deploy phase I sometimes look at cards and ask what their ability is to try to make them over-deploy to locations that I really will never go to.<br>
<br>
4.  Reading.  This is an example of something that was used against me.  My opponent, Josh Kohman, deployed a Kashyyk against me when I had no ships in my light side deck.  Then he deployed Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.  After the game he said that he knew I had no ships in my deck and that his Zuckuss in Mist Hunter was safe for the whole game.  Why?  Because I did something that signaled to Josh that I had no defense against his space drain.  I gave a sub-conscious signal to him and he knew me enough to understand it.  I won&#146;t tell you what that signal was because anyone can use that against me as I have almost no control over it.  But most players have sub-conscious reactions when things are not going their way.  If you play someone enough you can get to recognize it and use it against them.  This is simply getting to be familiar with an opponent and his reactions.<br>
<br>
5.  Decks.  This is the most common sort of mind game played.  The trick deck.	Hidden base that uses mains instead of ships.  MWYHL that tests 1 (or none) and then does mains.  Hunt Down that runs inserts.	ISB ops that uses Scum and Villiany.  This just involves using well known decks and then doing something novel with them.  This is also called originality and creativity.<br>
<br>
5. The Scrub.  This trick involves trying to make your opponent overconfident before you even play.  You try to give the impression that you are a scrub and that you don&#146;t know what you are doing.  I took Pokemon boxes to GenCon and DecipherCon to generate this image.  Josh Kohman ended up using the Pokemon box technique in second day of GenCon and convinced Michael Girard that he was the biggest scrub of all time.  Lesser known players get away with this easier.  You can do this in a game by tossing a few 2/2 scrubs down for a drain when they don&#146;t have a lot of cards in hand and you are holding a good combo.  They could come down with just Mara or Vader and you eat both characters but then come down with EPP Hit Squad and Weapon Lev, Clash, etc.  Talking about your killer ewok deck and reading every card he deploys that isn&#146;t premeire also help convey this image.  This doesn&#146;t do much good if your name is Brian Hunter though.  Plus at DecipherCon the only person that thought I was a scrub was Juz because of my Yellow shorts.<br>
<br>
6.  The Hint.  This trick involves tipping your hat a little to force your opponent to play more defensive.  You could &quot;drop&quot; a card by &quot;accident.&quot;  If you drop a Vader they may think twice about deploying that lone character.	Or if you drop an Ice Storm in your EBO deck, they may not even touch Hoth until they draw their Walkers, forcing them to delay their strategy.  This trick gets them to stall their strategy long enough for you to get more stuff to back up what is in your hand.  Of course, you don&#146;t want to reveal cards if you are just going to deploy them next turn anyway.  The following is an example of the Hint I played at Decipher Con.	I had no characters in my hand except for 4-lom with concussion Rifle versus a Profit deck.  I had an Always Thinking With Your Stomach in hand but my opponent was draining at the interior Audience Chamber.	On my turn I deployed 4-Lom at the Audience Chamber and drew a couple of cards but left some force.  My opponent thought that 4-Lom was the beginning of a beat down so he moved Han to Jabba&#146;s Palace where I could play Always Thinking With Your Stomach.<br>
<br>
7.  Redundant Counting.  This trick involves asking for a count of the opponent&#146;s deck to throw them off their strategy. Every now and then ask for a count of your opponent&#146;s deck and then pretend in your head by saying a few numbers under your breath then pretending to come to a conclusion. This will make your opponent think that you are card counting their deck as well as your own, and may force them into a mistake by being &quot;too careful.&quot; Or you could deliberately count out loud, and move cards in your hand so that it appears as if you&#146;re counting your hand.  Pretend your counting your hand, but don&#146;t count every card always stop at like 11 or 10,even though you may have 15 hand cards. This could prevent some Grimtasshs.  Of course, if they ASK you to count, you have to give them the proper number, but you could deceive them into never asking. Getting them to count makes their mind focus on other things besides what they are currently doing.  Sometimes when an opponent is hesitating in between actions and appear like they are trying to remember something I ask them to count their reserve or their hand to try to force them to forget what they are desperately trying to remember.  Memory doesn&#146;t always work right away and if you can distract your opponent you can use that to your advantage.<br>
<br>
8.  Question Asking.   Ask questions about cards that won&#146;t hurt you. For example, if you have a large hand but no duplicates, ask, &quot;It takes 4 force to play Monnok, right?&quot; When they say yes, ask them to count their force pile.  If they don&#146;t have 4 force, pretend to be relieved. If they have enough, get nervous.  This may lure them into playing a Monnok, even though it won&#146;t succeed.  Ask early gameplay questions that don&#146;t have any bearing on your strategy.	For example, ask &quot;Do you have to have 2 destiny in order for me to play Sabacc, or can I initiate it anyway?&quot; before you even begin play.  Then when you start with some CC set up, they will think you&#146;re playing Sabacc and try to gain control of the Casino, even though that is not part of your strategy at all.  Another example would be to ask if other scouts could move with Brooks Carlson when he reacts if you have him at a site with scouts.  This will make your opponent think you have a card that lets you react, and he may not battle you.  Or ask if you have to declare before totaling for Never Tell Me The Odds if Artoo is a 1 or a 6. This may make them hold onto You Cannot Hide Forever instead of getting the effect that they really need.<br>
<br>
9.  Hidden Base.  When playing against HB and your opponent flips, you ask &quot;Are you sure your Hidden Base system is on table?&quot; Their eyes will almost involuntarily look at<br>
their Hidden Base system, which will give you a good idea of which ones to probe.<br>
<br>
10.  Reminding.  This involves reminding your opponent of how to play their cards or how to play the game, for your advantage.	I have used this against Graham Neal when he was not going to force drain me at a location and I reminded him to drain there.  He thought I was being nice until I played Always Thinking With Your Stomach to make Luke go missing versus my BHBM.  I have seen people remind their opponent to move characters into places that they really shouldn&#146;t have moved too and to deploy things that shouldn&#146;t really have been deployed.  This is usually used by experienced players versus newbies.<br>
<br>
Now there are some things to understand about these Mind Games.  You never use them too much, unless you hate the person you are playing against.  I try to use only one on an opponent and I mostly do it when it is the first time I am playing them.  If you try to deceive an opponent too much they will not like playing against you and you will be a big jerk.	You don&#146;t want that.  Be nice when you play.  Never cheat and don&#146;t be too obvious about it.	AND no one should ever use these mind games against me.  I call it.<br>
