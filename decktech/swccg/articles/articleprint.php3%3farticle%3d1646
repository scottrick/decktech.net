Without it, players can find themselves making poor choices, waiting too long to make their move, keeping too many characters together to be effective, and any number of other mistakes.  On the other hand, overconfidence is just as sure a way to lose a game as lack of confidence.  Deploying too quickly, not adapting to combat an opponent's deck, or underestimating the drain/beatdown power of an opposing deck are all common mistakes brought on by overconfidence.  So now you've got two killer decks and you're ready to take the tournament scene by storm, but how do you go about winning consistantly?  The key is finding a balance; if you win the confidence game, odds are you will win in SWCCG as well.<br>
<br>
One of the earliest problems a new player will face is lack of confidence.  Newbies often go to tournaments with the mindset that they are not experienced enough, or their decks aren't good enough, or they aren't smart enough...any number of mental blocks that can prevent a strong performance.  In most cases these blocks are quickly passed over after a couple of good games or tournaments, but what happens if they aren't?  Some newbies stay newbies for quite a while because they let lack of success keep them from gaining enough confidence to face the stronger players in their area, therefore preventing them from playing up to their full potential.  The best way to gain confidence early is through repetition.  Most newbies do not know the local meta and/or have the money to compete with the big guns right away, so the best way for a new player to build confidence and skill is to know his decks inside and out.  Practice with friends or even against yourself until you know every card in your deck, what it does, and how it contributes to your overall strategy.  Be sure to play it against as many of the popular archtypes as you can, even if your opponent is using proxy decks or decks copied straight from DeckTech or another site.	Once you know your deck's strengths and weakness against other decks, it is much less intimidating to face those decks in the hands of other players.	Granted, that doesn't mean you will win against those decks, but knowing what to do can have a strong impact on your confidence level...and that sort of thing can help you the entire day and carries over to other events.  Another good way for newbies to improve their game and their confidence level is to talk to the locals; it's far easier to face a good player if he's more than just a face and a high rating, and you can learn a lot just by listening to those with more experience.  Plus, most players are eager to get new people into the game and will often go out of their way to help you out by giving you tips, deck ideas, and the like.  Once you are confident that you can play the game, you're well on your way to winning.<br>

Once a player gets past newbie status, lack of confidence is usually less of an issue, but it still is a factor.  Facing new decks or players is still fairly intimidating for most average players, and not knowing how to counter an opponent's strategy can leave you feeling that you have no control and cause you to second guess yourself.  The key to beating strange decks is sometimes as simple as appearing confident; if you make each play as if you know exactly what you are doing and avoid giving away nervousness or hesitance, you can occaisionally make your opponent nervous himself and leave him wondering what you have up your sleeve.  This rarely works against experienced players, but many times a person with a gimmicky deck is expecting to take people off guard...if you don't look taken aback, it can affect how he plays.  If appearing confident doesn't work against him, it can't hurt you either.  By forcing yourself to think clearly and stay in control, you also force yourself to think things through more carefully.  The key when playing against the unknown is to think clearly.  If you aren't sure what the beatdown potential of a new deck is, then don't leave characters alone.  If you see Luke and Ben running around, you probably don't want to deploy DLOTS unless you can handle a Fury.  By considering as many possible reactions your opponent can make to each of your plays, you will be less surprised if he takes one of those actions against you, and therefore better equipped to deal with it since you will already have thought out your options.  This helps keep the confidence level up substantially, as countering a part of your opponent's deck will show you that it is just another deck and it does have flaws like any other.  Whatever you do, keep calm and level-headed.	Draw each card like you KNOW it's that You Are Beaten that will save your skin, and if it isn't, then just weigh your options and play your own game.  If you can keep the confidence level up, you'll avoid dancing to the tune your opponent calls and can prevent you from playing right into his hands.	This is especially important against decks that are designed to manipulate you or alter your strategy.	ROps, MWYHL, SYCFA Manip; all can force you to play your opponent's game instead of yours.  Winning the confidence game does not guarantee you a win, but it will help you to better understand how the deck reacts to your moves and gives you a better chance at beating it the next time around.  In addition, losing a hard fought, well-played game to a manipulative deck can increase your confidence when you realize that you have faced one of the toughest deck types out there - the one that tries to beat YOU, not your deck.<br>

OK, so now you've played in a few tournaments and you're starting to do better, you know your decks inside and out and have adapted them to your playing style while teching against the local meta, your confidence level is up, and you've been getting into the top pairings or even winning at a couple of tournaments.	What now?  Well now you need to walk a thin line between over and under-confidence.  Sounds stupid, but it's the truth.  I've seen (and beaten) excellent players who let the fact that their opponent was relatively unknown or that their decks were fine-tuned monsters lull them into a false sense of security, sometimes discounting the opponent entirely or for much of the game.  It is fairly easy to get overconfident when you see a deck based around a strategy you've always beaten or when you play against someone you rarely or never lose to, but by letting yourself become overconfident you open yourself up to all sorts of problems.  First of all, there's the obvious and relatively common errors.  Player 1 has an insanely high Swiss rating and has won the last couple locals.  Player 2 is pretty unknown and has never won a tourney.  Player 1 assumes that he can take anything Player 2 throws at him and leaves some powerful characters alone or in small groups.  The next thing he knows, Player 2 has beatdown on a small group or lowered/prevented his drains or otherwise screwed him over.  This is a common scenario that most good players know to avoid, but it can be taken further.  Some players let the fact that a certain card or combo has always worked for them influence them far too much.  Just because you have Honor Of The Jedi in your deck does not mean you will always win against Hunt Down, for example.  Yet many players allow themselves to think this way.  In any case, overconfidence usually results in trouble when your opponent makes his move.  And almost inevitably, the moment your gameplan is disrupted by an opponent or deck that you'd written off as incapable of beating you, you begin to lose the confidence game.  Not only does it hurt you in the real game, but seeing Mara &amp; co. beat down on your characters hiding out in 'safety' at a twix site can make you start to wonder what else your opponent can do, hurting you in the mental game as well.  Pretty soon, an overconfident player can turn into a player with little to no belief in himself, which almost always leads to defeat.  Even worse, losing a game that you thought you had well in hand can hurt you for the rest of the day if you dwell on the loss.  So now that I've talked about overconfidence a bit, how do you avoid it?	It's pretty simple actually; just play every game as if you are facing an equal, no matter who it is or what he's playing.  If you take it for granted that your opponent can hurt your strategy and will try to at some point, you will be better prepared in that eventuality.  In addition, your confidence level will go up no matter what; if you anticipate a move against you or a key play, you'll feel more in control of the situation, and if he never does anything against you you'll know that you prevented him from disrupting your game plan and, in essense, locked him down.  Once again, the key is to play smart and think things through.<br>
<br>
OK, by now you may be thinking to yourself, &quot;Well this is interesting and may help me keep the mental edge...but what happens if I lose it anyway?&quot;  Well, the fact is that everyone will still face situations in which they could easily lose confidence in themselves.  No matter how well prepared you are, an unexpected play or card can sink you mentally a lot easier than it can in the actual game.  The fact is, you need to tell yourself that you can still win the game.  So you just took a beating when your opponent dropped Blast Door Controls and you couldn't Barrier?	Something Special Planned prevented you from Hyper Escaping?  Well that can mess with anyone's head, but the key is to remain calm and (once again) use your head.  If you play smart, you can usually still win or keep the game close at least.  There will be times when you know you've lost, as well.  So what do you do?  You can let yourself get down and allow your opponent to coast to victory, or you can go down fighting and minimize the damage.  If you remain confident, you may see an opportunity to lower the differential or even swing the game in your favor, but by allowing yourself to think of the game as already being over you may let opportunities like that slide right under your nose.  If you still lose, so what?  If you've kept fighting to the very end and remained strong mentally, you'll know that you did your best under difficult circumstances and you should be able to move on to the next game knowing not to make the same mistake again.  Always remember, LEARN from your mistakes, don't dwell on them.  A loss can actually be far more beneficial in the long rong than a win at times; by realizing this, you'll do far better at the confidence game.<br>
