Most of the People who have been around know most of this but there maybe a few things people do not realize can help.  This is Written based on my knowledge of Word 2000, however most older versions and other programs of this type have an equivalent.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  I do not know how this works for those who do not use English as their primary language.  Also the instruction I give in most cases are for MSWord(Word)<br>
<br>
First the Obvious ones:<br>
<br>
Spell check: Granted this does not work on most card names but most programs allow you to make a custom dictionary and add new words.  This saves some time after the first time.  Do not add abbreviations I will show a better way for these later.<br>
<br>
Grammar check: It can keep you from looking really stupid.  Helps your keep you from sounding like an uneducated Neanderthal.  Most programs have this Word usually will auto-scan for this.  If you do not know why your program is saying it is grammatically incorrect try to figure it out most will suggest a fix and why it is wrong but in some case you may just want to hit the ignore button.<br>
<br>
Quotes and Apostrophes:  These insert extra characters into you post.  I do not under stand why but I do under stand it has something to due with the computer language used by Deck Tech.  This is what you get when you use them if it allows you to post at all, &amp;687;5 or something like that.  Now it seems The Star Trek area does not have much of a problem with this but I do not take any chances.  Most programs have a find/replace feature.  In Word you click Edit and then the Replace option.  This pulls a window up in the Find section put an apostrophe and in the replace put *, Click the Replace All button and all of your apostrophes are now * and you do not get the extra characters that can make reading your post difficult.  Do the same for quotes only use **.<br>
<br>
Re-read your post, make sure it make*s sense.<br>
<br>
Abbreviations:  These can make reading post difficult for newer people.  It gets worse when there are 2 popular cards that could have the same Abbreviation.  Some times people use different abbreviations for the same card.  This is probably the most time consuming of the things you can do to make your post more readable with out actually typing out the every card name every time.  There are actually 2 ways to do this.  The easiest is type the card name once with (abbreviation) and then use that abbreviation through out the rest of your post.  The other option makes every thing clear every time.<br>
This can take a some time but once it is done there is very little maintenance and save you from typing out card titles but have them in there by typing the abbreviation.  This makes use of the auto correct feature in most programs.  Most programs will let you customize the Auto Correct in the same way you customize the dictionary.  For Word it is simply, Click on Insert at the top of the Page, Select Auto Text which will drop down another menu and click the Auto Text on that menu.  You will then get a window with tabs click the Auto Correct on the Far left.  It will the give you a Row divided into 2 cells.  Above the left Cell it says Replace and the other says With.  Type your abbreviation in the Replace side and the card Title in the With side and Enter.  Now every time you type WA/DODN what it will change it to Wise Advise/Do or Do Not.  Like I said it may take some time but you get the Speed of the abr. with the clarity of the Title.  <br>
<br>
While these tips may not improve the rating of your post it should not hurt it either and will be easier to read.<br>
<br>
Hope this Helps.<br>
