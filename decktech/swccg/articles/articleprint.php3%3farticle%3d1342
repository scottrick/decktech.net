<br>
Type: Starfighter<br>
Power: 3<br>
Maneuver: 4<br>
Hyperspeed: 5<br>
Deploy: 4<br>
Forfeit: 5<br>
Destiny: 0 or 7<br>
Icons: Astromech<br>
Text: May add one pilot. Permanent astromech is *R2-D2, who adds 2 to power, maneuver and hyperspeed. Luke of ability &lt; 5 deploys free aboard. Immune to attrition &lt; 5 when Luke piloting.<br>
<br>
Overall, this is a very strong ship. Now those cheap Luke's from Premiere may see some use again. Just slap this ship and Luke Skywalker down for a mere 3 force. This gives you an 8 power, 8 maneuver, hyperspeed of 7, and immunity to attrition less than 5. I think that this card is probably the best starfighter so far because it's so cheap to deploy, has good stats, and it has immunity. However, if you're using a ground deck, EPP Luke, Son of Skywalker, or Master Luke might be better suited than using Luke Skywalker in his trusty X-wing. I only think decks that mainly concentrate on space or decks that don't use mains on the ground should use this card as uses it will eliminate Luke's persona from the fighting on the ground where he is better suited.<br>
<br>
Rating (from 1-10): 8<br>
<br>
Has terrific destiny, very powerful but need's a key character, Luke Skywalker, to uses to its fullest potential.<br>
<br>
A New Secret Base: A new effect to make Echo Base Operations more viable -<br>
<br>
Type: Effect<br>
Destiny: 5<br>
Text: Deploy on 1st marker. Yavin 4 locations do not count for Imperial Decree. S-foils and your 'insert' cards are canceled. Once during each of your turns, may take up to two sites (or one site and one Effect) with 'Echo' in title or one planet system with two Light side icons into hand from Reserve deck/reshuffle. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
As you first read the text on this card, you see this card cancels inserts and S-foils, doesn't allow Yavin locations to count toward Imperial Decree, and it's immune to Alter. This makes it a solid starting effect for EBO decks that can't be cancelled by Alter. S-foils is not really needed as EBO gives you a +3 power bonus in space. Inserts with shielded sites was be kind of abusive so I guess killing inserts made sense. And finally, now if they want to cancel your drain bonuses with Decree they'll have to either come to Hoth on your turf to fight or go to space where you'll be strong too. Well, this new effect has a nice destiny of 5 but it would be better suited as a starting effect for an EBO deck. I think the best start would be Main Power Generators, the 4th Marker, and then The Signal for this effect. This let's you pull either two Echo sites a turn or an Echo site and an effect with Echo in the title. This allows you to get EBO out by turn 2 and you can also pull the other 3rd Anthology effect, Echo Base Garrison with this effect. You can also use A New Secret Base to pull a system with two lightside icons on it. This eliminates Coruscant, Kessel, and a handful of 1/0 or 1/1 systems from being used. This helps to balance the draining aspect of EBO I guess. So to sum everything up, this effect makes EBO quite viable as it will make it to set up faster yet also eliminates some abusive strategies like inserts or S-foils with EBO on table (you know how much power a lone X-wing would have?). It also keeps them from easily canceling your drain bonuses and it gives you a place to set up Incom Corporation. EBO looks to be very strong right now.<br>
<br>
Rating (from 1-10): 9<br>
<br>
Let's you pull out Echo sites, effects with Echo in title, systems with two icons for you. Cancels S-foils, inserts, Yavin sites don't count for Imperial Decree, and it's immune to alter.<br>
<br>
Echo Base Garrison: Effects that can be pulled by A New Secret Base it basically just helps out Rogue pilots and speeders -<br>
<br>
Type: Effect<br>
Destiny: 5<br>
Text: Deploy on table. Rogue T-47s are immune to attrition &lt; 4 (or &lt; 6 if matching pilot aboard). Once during each of your turns, may take one maintenance droid, Bacta Tank, Lone Rogue, Hoth Luke, Special Edition Wedge, Zev, or Hobbie into hand from Reserve deck| reshuffle.<br>
<br>
This card in my opinion isn't too powerful. Good points are that it let's you pull 8D8 out, maybe Zev or Luke to keep Maneuvering Flaps from getting Altered, you can pull out Bacta Tank, and it makes your Rogue Speeder's flying fortresses. Maybe a Rogue Speeder deck might be viable using Insurrection/high forfeit pilots/and Lone Rogue for automatic destiny combined with immunity to attrition.<br>
<br>
Rating (from 1-10): 3<br>
<br>
Let's see, it can pull out Rogue pilots, a maintenance droid, Bacta tank, Lone Rogue and it makes Rogue Speeders immune to attrition less than 4 or 6 if the matching pilot is aboard. I would just use The Signal to pull out Bacta Tank so that part isn't too great.<br>
<br>
Massassi Base Operations/One in a Million: New lightside objective that makes Attack Run easier and once flipped makes for some large drains -<br>
<br>
Type: Objective<br>
Front side: [Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay.] {For} remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors. {While} this side up, you generate no more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve deck| reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4. {Flip} this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls fewer than three Yavin 4 sites. {Place} out of play if Yavin 4 is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
Back side: {While} this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run, or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve deck| reshuffle. Your total power is +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star system is &quot;blown away&quot;, adds 3 to force loss for each opponent's Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter present with a pilot character aboard are each +2.<br>
<br>
I think this objective is alright. It's not very weak but it doesn't match up to Hidden Base or Throne Room. It keeps you from using abusive strategies like cloud/asteroids drain, using Revo's on everything, and keeps you from activating insane amounts after pulling out Yavin sites from Reserve. Basically you set up on Yavin at 2/0 sites I guess and Imperials are deploy +2 so that keeps them off your planet for awhile. Then you flip and pull Attack Run basics like Rebel Tech's, Death Star system, Attack Run, and Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve. You also get a power +3 at each system location. Then if you blow the Death Star way they lose a lot of force. Anywhere from 8 to 26 force. Then at systems all drains are +2 where you have a pilot character aboard. I think it will suffer against heavy drains (drop and drain ISB/Dark Deal/Ops) and maybe alien swarm. Even if you blow away the Death Star you can still easily lose however.<br>
<br>
Rating (from 1-10): 6<br>
<br>
A decent objective that speeds up an Attack Run deck.  Gives you strong space drains if you blow away the Death Star, good activation after you flip, and a battling bonus in space.<br>
<br>
Prisoner 2187: New Leia persona that only works with RTP decks. She can't be used as the captive in a CCT deck -<br>
<br>
Type: Rebel Character<br>
Power: 4<br>
Ability: 3<br>
Deploy: 0<br>
Forfeit: 6<br>
Destiny: 1<br>
Icons: Warrior<br>
Text: Deploys only if Rescue The Princess on table. May not be transferred while imprisoned. Adds 2 to your Force drains here. For remainder of game, your objective cannot be place out of play and, if Leia not on table, flip Sometimes I Amaze Even Myself.<br>
<br>
This new Leia makes RTP a very strong deck. It keeps Leia from being eaten by Bubo, keeps your objective from going out of play so easily, and it keeps her from being transferred while imprisoned. I think RTP is now similar to Profit in many ways. Now Leia can't be moved around while she's in a prison and you can just redeploy her to get your objective off the 0 side now if she ever dies. The force drain bonus isn't bad and Leia adds a destiny with the objective flipped. I think RTP could become very powerful as it makes unique ships, vehicles, characters go out of play if lost from battle and it eliminates their immunity and makes attrition +2 for opponent. Huntdown with suicide Vaders, COTVG/Scum and Villainy decks with recurring bounty hunters, ISB with unique characters, and Death Squadron Star Destroyers/Executor/Boba in Slave I all suffer from the flipped side of this objective.<br>
<br>
Rating (from 1-10): 9<br>
<br>
Makes RTP very strong by eliminating its most obvious flaws. Also, not many players know how to play against a good RTP deck and this can benefit you when going into tournaments with this deck.<br>
