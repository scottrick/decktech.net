It just kinda sneaks up on you. When you hear about it you remember vaguely what time of year it is. For me, This is my last year of High School, and also the first year of what i hope to be a long standing career as a Star Wars CCG Player. <br>
<br>
My first trip to regionals will feature two decks I will put up. Just so you dont waste your time wondering what the heck they are let me tell you, I will be featuring Kalit*s Revenge (a new lightside jawa deck) And Court is in Session... My first attempt at a darkside deck that is niether MKOS with Jawas Or Dark Deal. Those that know this name know the sacrifice to my name I will be doing by playing such a deck, but I will struggle on.<br>
<br>
Preparing for regionals is more mental than actual physical. To do this increadible feat will take you a lot of time money and patience. For newer players They might have bought a sealed deck tournament box. Keep it, tape the bottom and take pride in your decks home. I say tape the bottom simply for one reason, it will tear apart slowly usually with the bottom square comming off. Thats what im doing now infact. Taping the bottom of my Deck box.<br>
<br>
I come hailing from Alderaan and I&#146;ve been on deck tech about a year now. Those that know me probably have seen my jawa decks and my first dark deal decks (where i learned quickly that unless you had the objective you would be thrashed) My passion for jawas was met by another person. *Smalley* if your reading this then my jawas beat down your corran horn! He was a bit of a fanatic, but I proved my jawa deck was worth it and I could win a game!<br>
<br>
I digress. But for regionals or any tournament you get your deck boxes out you prep them for game and then you get to your decks. You build you tune and you prep like a mechanic. Look at my Witten Decks for dark side, three probably four generations of Jawa Decks now stand proudly before you, showing what a little tinkering and alot of patience can do. Jawas arent toilet paper, when done right these decks can be not only lethal, but fun as well. Jawa Beats are funny and outrageous, (as corran horn found out).<br>
<br>
Then you get your sleeves, you hunch over sleeving your decks painstakingly till your back aches from the hunching. Then when its all over you have the ticket to intimidation. Not only can you now mentally intimidate your opponent, but you can have fun doing it too. Your box is shiny, your deck is shiny. Its the best.<br>
<br>
You prepare over the course of a year painstakingly trying new things while not giving up. Sadly not a singe version of Wittens Fury will be appearing at Alderaan Regionals, just me and Witten*s nemesis Kalit. Beware people, jawas lurk everywhere. Prepare for regionals but at least tell me if your getting ready is similar...<br>
<br>
But the day before you can bet i&#146;ll be pumping music getting myself ready for something that is going to be my debut to regionals. If you see a guy whering a green flannel a grey hat and sporting jawas its me, waiting for my first victims. (or my first loss at the tourney, please take a number!) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
