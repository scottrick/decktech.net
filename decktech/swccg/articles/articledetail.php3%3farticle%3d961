<br>
When was the last time that your opponent played a card and you had to read the card and found out that it cost you a lot of force, or that you had to abandon part of your strategy?  Did you have to read the card a second time during your game when you found out that it was part of a combo that screwed you over?  Did you lose that game? OR Were you lucky?<br>
<br>
This article is designed to help every player find, use, and counter 'tech'.	It may not be for the elitists among you, but it should help out those searching for ways to counter those juggernaut decks that are dominating the tourney scene now, as well as provide a few new deck ideas.<br>
<br>
I.     WHAT IS TECH?(how do you define Tech?  if tech is what you can smell, taste and touch, then tech is simply electrical signals interpretted by your brain(I just had to say that, anyway...(if you didn't get that, you need to watch the Matrix again)))<br>
<br>
'Now that's tech' you hear from behind you and you look around to see someone pointing at something you just played...you either smiled/nodded, ignored, or agreed with what they said.  You take another look at the card you just played, you remember that you were very close to taking it out of your deck, but now you feel that much better about leaving it in.<br>
<br>
During many tournaments I have seen people walk around watching games and point out cards that are tech.  Tech cards are the missing link in a deck.  They are the cards that win games against 'particular' strategies.  But most of these cards have another use.  For example, let's take a look at Don't Forget the Droids...nevermind the text, if you know it, great, if you don't, you should.  Not only does this card cancel 3720 to 1(ok, not to appealing yet, but) you can play it lost to cancel an opponents battle destiny and sac one of your droids.  Now this doesn't come into use with every light deck, but if you've ever stuck R-3PO down to make U-3PO mad, likely dark gave him to you, and you can ff him with DFTD to cancel a battle destiny.  But is that why it's in your deck? probably not, but none the less, it's Tech, and when you use it for that reason, you feel good right?<br>
<br>
One of my favorite dark side cards, a counterpart to landing claw, but cancels light space drains in a different fashion, yep you guessed it Homing Beacon.  Not only does this cancel the ever pesky landing claw(during move phase though), you can chase light ships around the galaxy with it whenever you want, for free as well.	Homing beacon is one of those underused rares, that you will see from time to time, and is in Clint Hays' world deck I might add.<br>
<br>
In SWCCG tech is everything.  Tech is 'The other way to win the game.'  You've won and lost sac wars, but have you won and lost 'tech wars'?  Course you have.  A tech war isn't always a card vs. card battle in which many cards will be played during a turn, but that can often happen, and may turn into a SAC war.	But tech is something that starts as soon as you draw your starting 8, and lasts right up to when your opponent places his last card in the lost pile.	It is an ongoing game, meant to surprise your opponent, confuse your opponent, and goof up your opponent.  This is done through a variety of ways.  Tech consists of the 'little cards' that help you win the game.  These cards may not be in every version of the deck, but when they're not, it's always good to think of what use it might have in your own deck.<br>
<br>
Tech is not necessarily a strategy, but a strategy w/in a card, like playing throw me another charge to look in your deck to check destinies and then tracking it yourself, and when you have cards like this that have an alternative use as well, cancelling key components of the trooper horde decks(not that these were much of a threat anyway, but none the less).  And a similar darkside card masterful move, but this is a little more famous, because most people can usually fulfill the requirements pretty easily.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.  WHERE TO FIND TECH or WHAT KIND OF TECH IS BEST FOR MY DECK<br>
<br>
'How can I hurt this strategy the next time I play against it?' You said to yourself after you just suffered a loss.	Where did you look?  Did you remember to look in your own deck?<br>
<br>
Have you ever built a deck and have had empty sleeves, without ideas for what to put in their?	Odds are, you searched your entire collection for the absolute best card(s) to help perfect your deck.	You weren't searching for strategy, you already had it, you were searching for tech.  Ok, that last scenario was a little uncommon, but have you found yourself with more than 60 cards and still looked for other cards amoung your collection that would give you that 'hidden advantage' over your opponents during the game, when they least expected it.  Like many people, I started out believing that the only way to win would be to buy more packs to get more mains(or first mains, if you were like me(just about all of my friends can attest to my horrible luck)).  Just recently I found out that I had the cards to win since day 1.  Cards like friendly fire(shut up, this can hurt an epp beatdown squad), or others which could claim fame but were never noticed.<br>
<br>
Have you taken a look at Michael Girard's Vegas Style deck?  Pure ingenuity.  This deck has some of the most tech I've seen in one dark deck.  A good tech'd up light deck to take note from would be the 'Falke deck' aka Why Martin Falke in No.4 deck, filled with tech.  Each of these decks is filled to the brim with tech and has many ways to win, and use that tech over and over.<br>
<br>
These decks take one common strategy or card, and give it superiority and protection from what the opposite side would use against it in a 'normal' game.  What I'm trying to say is that they'll take one strategy and protect it with cards that are oriented around it, and around keeping that card in play and doing the maximum damage.<br>
<br>
When I want to make a deck chock full of tech, I go to the binder, and find something that makes me retrieve or makes them lose force(directly or indirectly).	Like in the afformentioned decks, lets look at sabacc and order to engage.  Both of which are highly used cards in todays tournament environment.  What normally happens when OTE hits the table.  Do you play all my urchins?	Do have have a hand full of barriers and clashes?  Do you have a stack of guys/X-wings that you don't want dark to keep running away from?  Or are you going to use an arcona to make them lose the force.<br>
<br>
Martin Falke uses an overwhelming amount of methods to make dark lose force to Order to Engage.  He is making that card count in the deck, and making it worthwhile surrounding it with tech.<br>
<br>
Looking for cards to help support your strategy can be found in the oddest places.  If you want early drains and are generating a lot , you may even consider jedi/dark jedi lightsabers(I've seen this before from a guy who placed 2nd in a tourney).  If you're looking for lots of recyclable destiny 5's and 4's just look in your commons and uncommons, they're all there.	Tech is not only giving you the extra bounce, but weighing your opponent down as well.<br>
<br>
When I was playing my friend at a tourney, I used a clash to search for uncontrollable fury, put it on vader, he played you are beaten to cancel uncontrollable fury, then I play weapon levitation to cancel that.  Now analyzing that, I lost 2 cards out of all that, whilst he lost 1, but made him lose a lot more in the end.  Weapon Levitation, an uncommon card, definitely good for most decks.  Not only can you cancel you are beaten, you can stick it in your used pile to track a nice 4, or you could even play it to have orimaarko or someone borrow mara's lightsaber.  But is weapon levitation good for ALL light side decks? no...is it good for your deck? perhaps.  Think about it, 'will this card help me win more?' or 'Wi<br>
<br>
When I was writing this article I paused and decided to work a little bit on my TIE scout deck, it has got a ton of tech, it has more tech than any other deck I've built, I'll post it sometime after I playtest a little bit with it(probably unless it crashes and burns).  But the concept isn't so much TIE swarm, but direct damage, there are about 10 cards that deal some type of direct damage.  Numbers(I stick some droids around the table, and some skrillings and other mope in passenger seats and insert) is one of them.  I have several ideas for the deck that make light side lose force.  Finding tech is easy, look through your collection, and find a card that makes your opponent lose a force or two.  I searched my box and dug out Abyss, it's an interesting dark side effect that says whenever an opponent draws a unique card for destiny while the duplicate is on table the destiny is lost and equals 0.  With a TIE scout deck, i won't be losing from this a lot, but imagine this...  Using macroscan to look at opponents top and seeing an obi or something, then use someone like Barquin D'an and make him lose the obi, and then he'll have to lose 2 more force or the other obi already on table, and all while you get to retrieve a card with Barquin, and he has to lose 2-3.	Or if you really wanna teck it up, use Tech M'or at same site as Barquin, and use omni box, and before wagering to peek at several of his destinys.<br>
<br>
My second tournament in Normal, Illinois was a very interesting one, I placed last, but I think I learned a little more than everyone else that day.  I learned about the uses of cards that aren't 6/6.  It was the first time I had seen many cards being played, and that night I searched my whole collection(I got to bed at about 4 that night) and found a lot, and learned a lot.  Shortly thereafter I found decktech, and since then my rating has gone up more than 150 points in 4 tournaments, and I'm becomming more consistant.  I haven't lost to my friends since, simply because I can tech them out.  For example take a card like The Dark Path(my friends and I used to make fun of this one), but use it to it's fullest extent(using cards to their fullest extent can win the game), and use something like Emergency Deployment to deploy the Executor or Vader for free!<br>
<br>
Now of course not all of the above mentioned ideas are always great for every deck, but when you look for tech, think.	'Does my strategy have a weakness?', 'Is this weakness common?', 'Is my strategy weak to SAC?'.  Answer these questions one by one, addressing each and then finding the tech to cancel out their counters.  Firstly, what is your strategy?  for now, we'll assume it's something like...(looks in random bag of different decktypes)...hmmm...(decides to draw again)...ok, X-wing Swarm.  What would be a weakness to X-wing swarm?	Card intensive perhaps?  Do I have the signals to pull out all the effects that my deck depends on?  What is my deck weak to?  Battle Order, First Strike, and Security Precautions.  Addressing one at a time assume that you are using undercover spies(tk, boushh, momaw, wyron, and 2 undercovers), instead of this, I'll run EPPS so that I can take control or occupy a site to fulfill battle order.  First strike can slow down your interrupts, so how would you deal with it?  I'll save force during each of my turns.  This isn't always the best strategy(but neither is X-wing swarm the best deck, so...) or I'll play Yoda's stew during my opponents turns, or activate and tunnel vision for any necessary cards that i'll need so that I can save the other force.  Lastly, Security Precautions.  I'll play It could be worse for the force loss.  But what will my opponent try to do to hinder this?  It's worse.  I can also pack It's a hit to cancel It's worse as well as benefit from the other uses of It's a hit.  For the no battledamage I'll use hyper escape until my base is found so that I don't waste int's/eff's to save myself from my opponent.	Is your strategy weak to SAC?  Yes, and to prepare for it, I'll play both Wise advice and Do or do not, and start Do or Do Not.<br>
<br>
Now, for a second, let's look back at undercover spies, what are my weaknesses then?  Still battle order, but assuming that I am generating a lot of force, we'll look beyond effects.  Bubo, Trample, Sniper, Hutt Smooch...all cards seen A LOT in todays tournament environment.  Let's look first at Bubo...how can I go after Bubo if I'm not running mains?  Easy, Momaw Nadon.  Next, Trample,  definitely the hardest method to counter, but possible, most Rops decks run 1-2 tramples, but trample isn't seen much elsewhere, so a grabber would do fine.  Then sniper, how about It's a Trap, a used interrupt, that can not only cancel sniper, but can be played lost to cancel a battle at a site, wow, imagine having boushh draining at executor for a turn, and then being accompanied with Vader's finest, a great way to escape that kind of situation.   And finally, hutt smooch, bothuwui comes to mind, not only 2 icons, and a likely 'no drain for you' location, if you control, undercover is immune to hutt smooch, good luck keeping control, but that shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
III.	HOW TO USE TECH<br>
<br>
Scenario- Your opponent just announced a force drain at the holotable and you're not sure of what to lose, you look through your hand and pass by transmission terminated, you know that you already cancelled visage, and it has been a few turns so if he had another, it'd already be out.  You don't want to lose the force off the top because it's set there because of a battle and you want to bounce Mara.  You take a quick glance at the text, and you're astonished and look over it again just to make sure.	Then you played TT to blow up the holotable.<br>
<br>
Okay, this is a no-brainer right?  Not always, many cards that are in good decks are seen over and over again in the same decktype(sort of like how just about every huntdown deck has a vader in their right?).  But the players don't always know exactly what the cards do unfortunately.  And because of that, you'll probably skip any judgement calls and put it into your own deck knowing that 'If this guy plays it, it's got to be good' right? how can you go wrong if he plays it?  Now this doesn't always go with every card.  Many times when you copy a deck, or try out a deck and find yourself in a situation, you're wondering 'How can I get out of this?	What card(s) could I use to beat this the next time I face it?	How can I use the cards I have now?'  Obviously I can't tell you how to defeat all the mains in the world while your hand consists of a couple of troopers, but I can tell you what you can do to hinder your opponents strat while boosting yours.  Eventually, you will know every ability of every card in your deck along with it's weakness.<br>
<br>
Using tech is like finding tech, except it's a lot funner because you get to see if all the effort was worth it.  Strategies that include a lot of tech may not be very efficient, because you have to know your ability to get those cards in your hand when you need them.  But when you can consistently find those needed cards when you need them, it becomes very useful, and you learn your deck more.	Combos like yoda's gimer stick and order to engage are really great, and they're even better if you can consistently get those cards into your hand each time you need them.	During many games I find myself knowing exactly what I need, and I'll signal for it, or play it if it's already in my hand.  Even though you shouldn't always depend upon effects/interrupts to help you, if you have a lot of twilek(or signals) then it's great so long as your opponent doesn't grab it.  Leaning on interrupts is different, unless you have something that can pull interrupts out of your deck when you need them(cards like tunnel vision, or even better unexcpected interruption) can work wonders, but you probably only use those to grab out certain 'needed cards'.  Depending upon effects is more reliable since there are cards that can infact pull them out of your deck to use at your disposal.  But being able to use interrupts when you need them is an even better skill.<br>
<br>
Here's an example, my friend built a Quiet Mining Colony deck similar to one on this site that utilized the Hiding in the garbage/Descent into the dark combo.  While I was using a space deck, he beat me with it, but that was because he got most of the cards in his hand when he needed them.  The next time I played him, he only got one of those cards out and it helped me out in the game, but eventually I alter'd it.  The point is, don't depend on tech, or at least not to the point where it decides the game when you lose 1 certain card to a force drain.  So when you find a good combo/card that you want to or need to get out every game, you need to make sure you have access to that card at the beginning of the game, and that it WON'T be canceled.<br>
<br>
I feel the best decks out there contain a lot of direct damage.  Now when I say a lot, I don't mean 50 cards that each tell your opposition to lose a force each turn, but sometimes that can be good.  I do however mean that you play one card that deals damage, and use it to it's fullest advantage.<br>
<br>
Play a Hoth site(preferably defensive perimeter), Hoth, and stick a mope there, let them beat on him(ghhhk the guy) and then put ice storm on their chars, play frostbite and sunsdown on hoth as well, and they'll have to lose 2 or more force per turn, that they can do little about.<br>
<br>
But are these strategies good for you? maybe, maybe not.  If you can devote your entire deck to this, you can however produce stunning results.  But look at frostbite...definitely not the best card for every deck, but if you devote your entire strategy to this, it can bring excellent(end the game in about 8 turns) results.  For example, if you wanted to use frostbite you could run ISB with several hoth sites.  A drop n' drain deck, deck, then play hoth, let them come and beatdown on all your characters, then play an icestorm, nighttime conditions(probably already out), and frostbite, and your opponent may have to lose 10 force a turn!!  Now that's tech.<br>
<br>
Have you ever come back from a tourney, one of your decks didn't win all of it's games, so you thought, ok, it's time to go back to the drawing board...where to start?  The best way to win is to inflict direct damage as soon as possible and in great numbers of force as well.	Not only this, but using a lot of tech to accompany this as well, because if you can't back up your strategy, you shouldn't play it.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.  HOW TO BEAT TECH<br>
<br>
Tech is a war.	Each game has it's battles, it's force drains, it's interrupts/effects, and it's tech.  Cards like Weapon levitation, Slight Weapons Malfunction(underused card, add a battle destiny, used, destiny 4), and many others.  But tech isn't a normal battle, not the type that you can simply playtest and know exactly when to spot during games.  Tech can make or break you or your opponents deck.<br>
<br>
If they are running the claw you can be prepared with homing beacon or those rebels won't escape us.  Each of those cards have other good uses, such as the ability to cancel space drains, cancel nabrun, or even hyper escape.  If your opponent is running a speed drain, you can use ABrightCenter2tUniverse, or decree(ignores revo too), and maybe even weapon of an ungrateful son(to stick a saber in the pile, this is also good if you're dueling), to lower the drains.<br>
<br>
Let's go back to the decks on topic.  In Vegas style, Michael Girard focuses on one key strategy, sabacc.  Now, when you posted your latest light side deck, did you include a strategy section for CCT/sabacc?  you didn't? why not?  Maybe you forgot, but if you were playing against one during a tourney what would you do?  (The problem with decks like that is that they're slowly becoming popular, but not popular enough to add in a strategy against in your deck strat section).  You'd probably know what's comin' and signal for a grabber.  He holds off of sabacc for a turn and plays Frustration on your grabber.  Well, that strat is now gone.  Losing this tech battle has likely cost you the game.  Now this has got you thinking, while reading this, you might've paused to contemplate exactly what you would do in such a situation.  Would you pack more grabbers?	No, you'd use more tech than him.  If this means packing more grabbers, then by all means do so, because it can win the game.	Now, not in every game are they going to have every counter to everything in your hand in their hand, but when they do, you know it, you feel it.  But eventually everyone's luck runs out right?  Now you shouldn't count on luck to bring you the win because if you do, you'll likely go 3-3 because that's how luck is.  But let's talk about card intensive.	Card intensive isn't always a great thing, but none the less, it's tech.<br>
<br>
My friend discovered a way to get power 15 x-wings(w/out the use of out of nowhere), but go figure, a lot of cards are involved.  And with most great decks, including Vegas Style card intensive can prove to be a weakness when it comes to the whole mixture of things(many cards each serve their own purpose).  When you play against a deck that's filled to the brim with tech, you have to summon every effort you have to bring them down, because it's possible that they don't have the resources to combat one of your strategies.  When you see them lose something off the top that could hurt your strat, know then that the road is clear and that you should then use it to win, and do your best to prevent it from being retrieved back.	You may force them to use an unexpected interruption to fetch a twilek to fetch some effect.<br>
<br>
True, it's all tech, and when used at the right time will destroy every last ditch effort you put forth, but all card intensive strategies are weak to something, usually its SAC.  So you say he has There is No Try out, big deal, lose the force, you may even have an ICBW for that force loss, but hey, you got to cancel the card right?  If it's critical, you could even play an it can wait on one of their cards so that you can get in one of yours in time.  There is no try isn't out to make you lose force, it happens, but it's out to make you not want to play S/A, and when you do, and willingly lose the force, dark side is usually mad because you hurt them in some way or another.  If oppressive enforcement is out as well, then obviously it'll be a hard fought game, because they don't lose any force and you lose 3, and just delay one of their cards.  This can help you win if done at a critical time, but they'll just track it back to their hand next turn.  What do you do?  Try to track it yourself and then drain them at the right time so that they lose it off of the top or something, but I've found the best strategy against these types of decks is direct damage...<br>
<br>
For example, civil disorder, take something that says that they have to do something, and make it hurt them.  Even if if means playing an x-wing swarm with undercover spies, yoda, dos and a crew at dagobah and oola for civ dis, get it done, make them lose force.	Another good card is Order To Engage.  This card isn't immune to alter, but if it's not cancelled it can help you win the game.  If it means having 50 guys at a site to their 4 guys, or using gay arcona tech, or looking for some techy card that'll do it for you(narrow escape, and hyper escape come to mind) then use that.  Another great direct damage card is #'s.  This is one of the toughest decks to beat, but has a very easy to see weakness...another number deck, or torchure/vesdan.  Direct damage hurts every deck, because when they have to lose force whether it be from deck or hand, it's very possible for that force to be a card that they could've used against you.  Direct damage is becoming more common in the tournament scene.  An example would be of course the two 'new' ejp objectives, which make you lose force for what's on/not on the table.<br>
<br>
One thing this article will teach, eventually, is that there is no such thing as an unbeatable deck, because they all have a weakness, whether you can exploit it or not, it can be found.  Whether the weakness is in the player or the deck, nothing is invincible.  In college basketball it was once said 'On any given night, a team can beat you,' which should be translated into ccg: No one man/deck will win every game.  I know what you're thinking now 'he's getting off focus, I'll have to mark him down to 3 stars for that', but it goes back to luck, when you're being 'tech'd out' there is usually another way to win.	This way may be draining, it may be not, but that depends on the situation.<br>
<br>
When deciding on what cards to use to beat a particular deck strategy you have to learn the deck.  Play the deck a few times to see what it depends on.  Let us take a look at the ever-popular ralltir operations.  Now to beat this deck, it is said that the best strategy is to battle.  How are you going to battle when their attrition is +4?  Think of how they battle...At-Sts are their main battling card.  Use this to YOUR advantage.  They have the ability to react, and some for free, so deploy (or nabrun) your group to the site with the free-reacting atst, play mechanical failure, and frozen assets, you should have about 20 power to their 0 power(with a ff 0), if they move some stuff over next turn, do the same, or play something like under attack(works wonders).  So you say they use alters?  Early on, play an 'alter grabbing' effect such as goo nee tay with a grabber in hand for when they try to alter it(or use an obj. like Mind What you have learned).  Cards such as order to engage/yoda's gimer stick also work well against Rops, but only play this when Vader and Mara are already out on table and at different sites.  As you can see, with the right tech, you can win any and every game.<br>
<br>
Going up against decks with direct damage or a limitless supply of super-tech that can be used at any time, usually is vulnerable to a deck that establishes a fast presence.  Whether this is a beatdown crew to one system/site or whether it is a certain couple of effects that hinder/slow their strategy early on, it can usually help you out a lot.  Usually you know pretty early on whether or not you will win or lose the game, because maybe you've lost some critical cards from an early drain or fast beatdown, or you've seen them lose the cards that could crumble your strat.  But never fall asleep during the game OR don't let your opponent play a luke, play on the edge for 5 force, play a jedi levitation for a retrieved effect and pummel afterward.  Never assume the game is yours until it is because like I said, the tech war doesn't end until the last card is drawn/lost.  Until then the game is still up in the air.  And always be ready to lay the hurt in some way or another.  Never discard your tech to the reactor terminal until you know that a comback at this point would be a miracle.<br>
