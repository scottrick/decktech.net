I hope it lives up to your expectations and raises the playing level across the board, whether you&#146;re breaking out of the newbie shell or at the top looking to stay. I would suggest that you read &quot;Tracking Is For Everyone&quot; on my page (BlackViper) before you read this - it is ADVANCED strategy.<br>
<br>
Rule #1: KNOW YOUR DECK. I&#146;m talking inside out, sideways and backwards. Know how many cards you start with, how many you activate, how many are in what pile AT ALL TIMES. This can make you a beast. I track the same 3 cards through my deck during any given game, and I track them at all times. In the Used Pile, 3rd one activated, or even if it&#146;s the 34th card down in the deck. You need to know. It&#146;s not really as bad as it seems. Here&#146;s how you can do it:<br>
<br>
First, you need to know how many cards you&#146;ve got. Let&#146;s pretend that you&#146;re playing BHBM ViperTech (check it out on my page for reference - M&amp;T using Human Shield). I start the Objective, DS2 Throne Room, Insig Rebel, and Your Destiny. Prep Defenses brings out Mobile Points, IAO, and Secret Plans. I have 8 cards on the table. I&#146;m going to draw 8 cards for my starting hand, so that&#146;s 16 cards out of my deck. My reserve deck has 44 cards left in it. I&#146;ll activate 5 Force (2 at DS2, 2 from my opponent&#146;s Agents deck, and 1 for me) and get stuff from the deck. I pull Palpy, Emp Power, Force Lightning, Carida, and the DS2 DB. I&#146;ve got 39 cards left.<br>
<br>
That&#146;s the basic principle of knowing how many cards are left. Later in the game, you&#146;ll have fewer cards, and it will get easier to count. Just keep the number in the back of your head. It helps to know your addition/subtraction tables off the top of your head so you can keep most of your concentration on your actual game. Let&#146;s jump ahead in the game. Here&#146;s the board:<br>
<br>
Tatooine - Aud Chamber - Desert - Tat DB - DS2 DB - DS2 Throne Room - CC: DB - Endor: DB - Carida<br>
<br>
* Lord Vader has his lightsaber at Cloud City and is sitting with Tarkin waiting for something to happen. (4 cards)<br>
* Mara has her saber and sits patiently with Xizor and Guri at the Tatooine DB. (4 cards)<br>
* Palpy is talking tech with Sim and Janus at the DS2 Throne Room. Emperor&#146;s Power and Presence Of The Force are deployed there. (6 cards)<br>
* No one is on Endor. (1 card)<br>
* Zuckuss and 4LOM are at Carida. (3 cards)<br>
* Bossk and Dengar are holding Tatooine with an iron fist. (2 cards)<br>
* Aside from your starting stuff, your other table cards are Battle Order, Oppressive Enforcement, and Imperial Decree. (5 starting effects + 1 objective + 3 others = 9 cards)<br>
* Your lost pile includes Prep Defenses, Alter, Force Lightning, Emperor&#146;s Power, Tarkin, Human Shield, and Mighty Jabba. (7 cards)<br>
* You have Force Lightning, Human Shield, Twi&#146;lek, Lord Vader, and Masterful Move in your hand. (5 cards)<br>
<br>
Right now, you&#146;ve got 19 cards in your deck. Doesn&#146;t seem like a lot, but your opponent is pinned down with some serious hate going on. We&#146;ll track Masterful Move (destiny 6), Twi&#146;lek Advisor (destiny 5), and Force Lightning (destiny 5) for the rest of the game just in case your opponent tries anything. I&#146;m going to make this explanation as simple as I can: R = Reserve Deck, F = Force Pile, and U = Used Pile. #1 is the top card of a pile, #2 is the 2nd card of the pile, and so on.<br>
* Activate 17 cards. R=2 / F=17 / U=0<br>
* Use 3 for Twi&#146;lek Advisor. R=2 / F=14 / U=4 / Twilek is U#1.<br>
* There is no effect in the deck. That&#146;s good. There&#146;s also nothing to pull with Masterful. That&#146;s good. R=2 / F=14 / U=4 / Twilek is U #1.<br>
* Use 1 Force for Masterful Move. R=2 / F=13 / U=6 / Masterful is U#1 / Twilek is U#3.<br>
* Use Janus to put back your Force Lightning and draw a card. R=1 / F=12 / U=8 / Masterful is U#2 / Twilek is U#4 / Force Lightning is U#8 (bottom).<br>
* Recirculate. R=21 / F=12 / U=0.<br>
* Your hand consists of an extra Vader and Human Shield.<br>
<br>
Now the only thing you need to remember is the destiny setup of your Reserve deck. You can save yourself a little grief by using the previous Tracking technique (from my Tracking Is For Everyone article) to track the Force Lightning. Just remember it&#146;s on the bottom. Here&#146;s the deck from top to bottom:<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
6<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
*12 more cards on bottom*<br>
<br>
If he gives you any loss, lose off the top. Let&#146;s say he drains you for 1 at the Audience Chamber. Lose the top of your deck. He drops Cappy Han and EPP Leia in the Falcon against Zuckuss. You draw something and a 6, getting around his immunity and killing off something. His 3 destinies kill everything there.<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = 6 / WASTE<br>
<br>
He also dropped Ben, Jedi Luke, and Orrimaarko against Mara, Xizor, and Guri. Fine. Slice Jedi Luke with Mara&#146;s stick (crap and a 5 are usually going to hit him).<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = 5 / WASTE / 6 / WASTE<br>
<br>
Use a Force to let Janus to put Human Shield on the bottom of your Used Pile and draw one. You want your destiny to be that 5.<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = WASTE / 5 / WASTE / 6 / WASTE / 5<br>
<br>
Lose a card off the top to draw an extra destiny.<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = WASTE / 5 / WASTE / 6 / WASTE / 5<br>
<br>
Have Sim check the top destiny of your opponent.<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = WASTE / WASTE / 5 / WASTE / 6 / WASTE / 5<br>
<br>
Now as you draw your destinies, you will draw some random destiny for ability, and Emperor&#146;s Power lets you draw that 5 as well.<br>
<br>
U (from top to bottom) = 5 / WASTE / WASTE / WASTE / 5 / WASTE / 6 / WASTE / 5<br>
<br>
Luke is forfeit 0, Orri is forfeit 4, and Ben&#146;s immunity doesn&#146;t hold up. You&#146;ve just cleared the site. Not only that, but every other card in your Used Pile is a high destiny. You remember that you had 12 cards in your deck (without having to look). You can count to make sure. Some TDs don&#146;t let you count your Life Force during a game for some reason. If this is the case, use Palpy&#146;s game text to look for a Force Lightning. Gee, there&#146;s not one in there (anymore). Count them before you replace the deck. Recirculate.<br>
<br>
On your turn, make fun of them because they&#146;ve got to lose 3 to Your Destiny. Activate 12. Now your former Used Pile is all that&#146;s left, and it&#146;s in the same order. Activate 2 more (you&#146;ve still got Force in your Force Pile from last turn, and you don&#146;t have anything to deploy). Now here&#146;s your destiny setup:<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
WASTE<br>
6<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
Drain all you like, then draw a few if you feel so inclined. If you find a high destiny card, use Janus to put it on the bottom of the Used Pile and draw a top card. Your Used Pile only has 2 cards (top is crap, bottom is a 5), and your deck lost a card off the top. Here&#146;s your deck as you recirculate and wait for your opponent to die away:<br>
<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
WASTE<br>
6<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
WASTE<br>
5<br>
<br>
On your opponent&#146;s turn, you have the option of using Janus to burn a card off the top and/or losing a card for Emp&#146;s Power to burn a card. You can draw a high card whenever you feel like it on your opponent&#146;s turn. That&#146;s some SERIOUS deck manipulation tech. Even if you don&#146;t have any reason to draw destinies, you&#146;ve just done a LOT of damage through the multiple turns of good drains and the battles. Sweet.<br>
<br>
This was a simple example, of course. You should choose the cards you&#146;re going to track during your deck building. Choose high destiny Used Interrupts for this. You should start tracking these cards through your deck (as many or as few as you want, I personally track 3 at a time) as soon as you&#146;ve pulled everything you need to pull. In other words, don&#146;t use Out Of Commission and look for a Docking Bay, because the Out Of Commission is going to get shuffled and lost in the deck. Once all your docking bays, Force Lightnings, Occupations, Raltiir sites, or whatever are out, then you can start the counting game.<br>
<br>
Early game, I like to track my destinies about 10-15 cards apart. This way I can get a tracked card whenever I want. Otherwise, I might not be able activate enough Force to get to my card (Ommni Box is card # 24 in the deck, but I only activate 13 Force. Oops!). On the other hand, if Masterful Move is card # 14, then I can activate to that high destiny, draw it, then next turn activate to the Ommni Box and draw that one as well. Next turn I activate to the Masterful Move again. Getting the idea?<br>
<br>
In this, the early game, you will probably have anywhere from 35-40 cards actually in the deck. Plan your tracking accordingly. Track 4 cards at the start. As the game goes on and you&#146;ve only got 25-30 cards in the deck, lose a couple tracked cards and stick with 2 or 3. Late in the game, every card counts. Track as many destinies as your brain can handle without losing focus of your game play strategies. If your game is going through a lot of single battles, track the same destiny (or destinies) that you&#146;re drawing. Activate all but 2, battle, draw those 2. Recirculate. On their turn, draw those same 2 again. Recirculate. Activate all but 2, draw the same 2 cards again. Recirculate. It&#146;s an easy and effective engine.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of some cards that can easily circulate. These are not the ONLY cards that are easy to track; these are just the ones I use commonly.<br>
<br>
DARK SIDE:<br>
* Ommni Box (5)<br>
* Twi&#146;lek Advisor (5)<br>
* Masterful Move (6)<br>
* Abyssian Ornament (5)<br>
* Force Lightning (even on your own characters) (5)<br>
* Dark Maneuvers (on your opponent&#146;s ship, if you need to) (6)<br>
* Shocking Revelation (5)<br>
<br>
LIGHT SIDE:<br>
* The Bith Shuffle (5)<br>
* The Signal (5)<br>
* Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes (5)<br>
* A Few Maneuvers (6)<br>
* You Will Take Me To Jabba Now (5)<br>
* It Could Be Worse (4)<br>
* Out Of Commission (5)<br>
* Shocking Information (5)<br>
* How Did We Get Into This Mess (4)<br>
<br>
This should get you well on your way to tracking. Build your deck knowing that you want to track these high destiny cards. Practice against your circle of friends and keep your tracked cards face up. Try with them face down and guess when your tracked card is on the top. Since it&#146;s a fun game, you can check to make sure you are right and counted correctly. This is the best way to get used to tracking fast - playing with your tracked cards face up against friends. Remember to count over and over again. It seems like a pain, but if you practice it long enough, it will become natural to have that little 19 in the back of your head, then next turn it turns into a 9, then next turn you slaughter your opponent in a horrific battle with a high destiny. When you&#146;re ready, take your tracking skills to a local tournament and see how you fare.<br>
<br>
The first rule of thumb is DON&#146;T GET EXCITED! You will start to get jumpy as you realize your opponent is almost asking you to kill him with your tracked destinies. When you get excited, you lose count. You miscount. You forgot that you just shuffled your deck and you&#146;re going to draw a 0 and a 1 instead of a 6 and a 7. This goes back to practicing. It&#146;s natural to get excited when this kind of thing starts to happen to your games. The random element is gone. I have more control than I did last time. When you practice, you&#146;ll get used to having the destiny and make fewer mistakes because of it.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps the game play of the entire StarWars community. Last article, someone wrote in the ratings &quot;I fear this will level the playing field for newbies.&quot; Boy, do I have stories to tell you.<br>
<br>
I also want to answer another question that has popped up a couple times: Do I regret writing these strategies? No. It is true that I have lost several close battles (and even games) because my opponent is using my own tracking techniques against me. I don&#146;t know how the rest of you normally do it, but this is Tracking Viper-style. No one taught me how to do this except me. So when you are using it, I can see it in your eyes. ;-) More power to you. The entire idea behind writing these strategy articles is to raise the game play level of StarWars players; therefore, if you beat me using my techniques against me, I have succeeded. Just make sure when you win Worlds, you give me a prop somewhere in there! j/k. So the answer is no, I don&#146;t regret making people better players.<br>
<br>
As always, please feel free to d-mail me with any questions or comments you might have. Thanks for reading!<br>
<br>
&quot;Mind what you have learned, for dangerous is the path ahead. Many foes will you face, yes! But draw low will you not, *hmph*! Lose close battles you will not. *Hmph*! Play foolishly you must not, for strong are your opponents. Tarkin and Vader you wish to fight alone? Strong are you with the Force... but not that strong. Knowledge a tool this is. Save you it can.&quot;<br>
