The topic of this article &quot;The art of Trading&quot; gives you a bit of presage of things to come. The reason I decided to write an article on this topic is because, its something not really discussed on decktech, and I have yet to read an article about &quot;trading&quot;. You may wonder how does this effect the way I play, and why should I read this article in the first place. Good question, I hope to show you how to make some good trades and come out on top; but at the same time offer my opinion on what I think of trading. How does this effect the way you play? Well thats easy, you get the cards you need by trading, and then you go play! This article is really for new players; veterans usually know all the tricks in the book. To all the veterans out there, please rate accordingly -this is aimed towards the new players. So please read on as I intend to delve into, &quot;The Art of Trading&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Like many Collectible Card Gamers, I started collecting before playing and this gives me a bit of an edge when bartering for the cards I need. There are roughly five groups of possible traders, and deals. I will break these up and tell you why or how you can make a good deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Number 1: The collector ----Does the person I am about to trade with, play the game of SWccg. If not, sorry no deal. I do not like to trade with non-players, no matter how well I will benefit from the possible outcome. To me the local players could use the cards, and I will not trade with &quot;Outsiders&quot;. I would rather trade with some &quot;gamers&quot;, or not trade at all! Now before you go and get all worked up, I will explain how to work the &quot;Art of Trading&quot; with these non-players. Most people who collect only, are only looking for certain cards either they want to complete a set, or have a buyer for something in particular. If this is the case, youre home free; usually you can look through a whole stack of his traders and get a lot for a little. Dont feel guilty about this, remember he is coming to you, he needs the card and is more then willing to give up a large quantity. He doesnt care how good trample is, he just knows that he needs Chief Chirpas Hut to complete his Endor Set. At the same time, these can often be the hardest trades to pull off. More then likely, the collector knows the price of every single card, and looks at trades with dollar $signs$ in his eyes. This will work to your advantage, go ahead and trade your BB Darth Vader for 4-6 Outer rim scouts, the collector will look at the $amount and figure it was a good deal. And as we all know, it sure was!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Number 2: The Newbie ---- For me personally, I always trade heavy with the newbies. I am always way too generous with new players, I want them to have more cards and keep them interested and coming back to this great game. Scenario A: You are the Newbie, chances are you have some buried treasures inside your trade binder - Maybe a Walker Garrison, Vaders obsession or maybe even a outer rim scout or two. To all the newbies out there, trade each of your cards like they are your favorite. Chances are if someone really wants a card of yours, they will continue to add cards to the trade in your favor.  Here is a little bit of &quot;Art of the Trade&quot; for you newbies reading this. Ask to see a trade binder, if theres something in there you want, keep it to yourself dont let him know right away. Ask that player if they want to see your binder, if they find something they want, flip casually through their binder again and then make your way around to the card that you wanted. What this does is shift the trade in your direction, all of sudden he wants your card and you can take your pick. I used this trick to my advantage in the past, believe me; it works. Scenario B: You are the veteran, trading with a Newbie as for the &quot;Art&quot; all newbies need Mains&amp;toys or the big blue beauties. So this works in your favor, Go ahead and trade the Vader w/saber for that Harvest, Incom Corp, Imperial command and a S&amp;V. Some of you might feel this trade is too good in either direction, obviously this is just an example. Feel free to adjust as you see fit. The point I am trying to make is that new players need the big cards, where as older players need doubles and triples of some key interrupts and effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Number 3: The Seasoned Player: This is what kind of player I consider myself. I am not a veteran (being around since premiere) and by no means a Newbie (I have won tourneys, and have been playing for awhile). These are often really tough deals to make, because we all kind of have the cards we need, we more then likely just make deals for the cards we like and for the aesthetic appeal in our binders. But being a seasoned player, we have quite a bit of awareness of swccg and with this &quot;awareness&quot; we can make deals that have a great outcome. So with that, I will lead into the &quot;Art&quot;. When I first found out about DS2 starters, and that General Solo and Chewie of Kashyyk were to be included in these starters I went and traded all the copies I had. I was making some sick deals; I was trading this pair of cards like they were a ghhk and a signal. Some of the local players were wondering why I was doing this, sure enough when the DS2 rolled around- they knew. I wasnt ripping anybody off, and to me it was a great deal. They were getting two great cards, and I was getting some key cards that I needed. The same thing goes for Reflections 2, most seasoned players know, about the box toppers and other great additions in this set. So for those of you out there, who are going to buy a large amount of Reflections2 (like me) go ahead and trade a few Maras and some Hans w/blasters, Leias w/guns. Chances are your going to get them back, in the boxes of Reflec2. You may even want to take a real gamble and trade away your URs; you will make a great deal now, and may come away with another UR in Reflec2. (Man those new cards are going to be great! I cant wait!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Number 4: The Veteran: Ahh  the Veteran, a fountain of information, and a geyser full of cards. These are the players you always want to be trading with, chances are if you have a card they need, by the end of the tournament they will have it. These guys have been around since the commencement, they know all the tricks and are fully updated with all of the erratas. These are the guys who have a page full of cool Japanese cards, and probably have cards you have never seen. As for the &quot;Art&quot;, not much to mention here, although I do have a trick for the Newbie. As a Newbie, you will have to find out who the Veterans are, and very nicely ask questions about every aspect of the game. Ask certain questions about decks, ask how long they have been playing, ask how many tournaments they have won and most importantly be nice the entire time. I dont mean gross &quot;Fake&quot; nice; I mean sincere. When the end of the tournament rolls around, ask if they have a {insert card title here} for trade, more then likely the will give you a great deal or just give you the card. And if you are real lucky, that veteran will take you under his wing, and you will become his padawan. This will do wonders for your playing ability, and you will learn invaluable skills. I will now throw a shameless plug out to the veteran I learned all the tricks from, Nicholas Burke. For those of you who know him, hes a great player and has taught me a lot (including the ability to track). Anyway, I dont want to stray too far off the topic. Basically the Veteran is the Ice Cream Man, and the Newbie is the sweaty little kid with two nickels rubbing together in his pocket, looking for a free Klondike bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Number 5: The Friend: Lastly we come to the friend, this is the person we borrow cards from, before we would trade. None the less, I had to include the friend; a friend of the game is awesome. Some of you out there have friends whom just collect dark side, have just got into the game -or my favorite, are rich. These are the easiest trades to make, you need a certain card they need a certain card- you make the deal, end of story. Sometimes you will have to convince your friend the worth of a certain card, or just how good a card is for your local Meta. As for the &quot;Art&quot;, there is none. After all, youre friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And this will conclude my article &quot;The Art of Trade&quot; I hope you liked it, and I hope you will think of the key points, next time your making a deal. If you have any questions, or suggestions.
