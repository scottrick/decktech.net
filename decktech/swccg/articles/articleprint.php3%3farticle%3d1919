<br>
     For those of you who don&#146;t know, there has been a Ruling made by Decipher regarding future JPSD Sealed Deck tournaments. Here it is:<br>
<br>
Star Wars Update: Jabba&#146;s Palace Sealed Deck Tourney Ruling<br>
Fri, Nov 10, 00 01:02:43 PM EST<br>
This is extremely important for all of you who are either planning to run a JPSD tourney or attend one.<br>
In the interest of preserving the integrity of the Jabbas Palace Sealed Deck tournament environment for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, Decipher is instituting the following rule to apply specifically to JPSD tournaments:<br>
&quot;Any character of ability 1 who has an unmodified (printed on the card) deploy number of 3 or greater is considered, for all purposes, to be of ability 2. (This rule applies to both Dark Side and Light Side characters)&quot;<br>
The above is an officially sanctioned tournament rule for the JPSD Sealed Deck tournament environment issued by Decipher Inc; its purpose is to balance gameplay within the JPSD environment, and has been tested accordingly. This rule should be used only in JPSD tournament games, and does not apply to tournaments using Standard Constructed Deck rules, or to any other Closed Environment or Sealed Deck environment.<br>
It is understood that this ruling will take effect immediately and should be recognized by all Tournament Directors beginning with the weekend of November 10, 2000. When using this additional tournament rule, it is recommended that a TD announce the change to all participating players before gameplay begins.<br>
For specific questions regarding this new tournament rule, please contact jediknight@decipher.com, with the subject heading &quot;JPSD tournament rule&quot;.<br>
Thank you for your participation,<br>

Decipher&#146;s trying to balance the scales here, which have been in the Light Side&#146;s favor. But will this really help all that much?<br>
Here&#146;s a list of DS aliens with a deploy of 3 or more and an ability of 1:<br>
<br>
1. Amanaman<br>
2. Amanin<br>
3. Aqualish<br>
4. Barada<br>
5. Bib Fortuna<br>
6. Chevin<br>
7. Gailid<br>
8. J&#146;Quille<br>
9. Klaatu<br>
10. Malakili<br>
11. Murtocc Yine<br>
12. Nizuc Bek<br>
13. Nysad<br>
14. Trandoshan<br>
15. Velken Tezeri<br>
16. Vizam<br>
17. Weequay Guard<br>
18. Weequay Hunter<br>
19. Weequay Marksman<br>
20. Weequay Skiff Master<br>
21. Whiphid<br>
<br>
Now, the LS aliens with a deploy of 3 or more and an ability of 1:<br>
<br>
1. Klatooinian Revolutionary<br>
2. Max Rebo<br>
3. R&#146;kik D&#146;nec, Hero Of The Dune Sea<br>
4. Shasa Tiel<br>
5. Tanus Spijek<br>
<br>
Okay, so maybe they have a point. This&#146;ll help the DS a lot more than it will the LS, which was the intended effect. All those Weequays you&#146;ll get in the packs are decent now, J&#146;Quille&#146;s even more of a monster, Bib Fortuna&#146;s even cooler, those Klatooinians running around are better than ever, etc. Whether this will solve the Dark Side&#146;s problems is yet to be seen, so don&#146;t get your hopes up yet. Did Decipher make the right decision? Probably, but who knows?<br>
