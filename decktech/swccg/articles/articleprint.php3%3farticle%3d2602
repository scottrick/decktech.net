<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Anger, Fear, Aggression - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/angerfearaggression.html<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve noticed a lot more people using this card.  THANK YOU PEOPLE!  This card is a killer in non-interactive decks like MWYHL.  Other than that it doesn&#146;t have many uses... and this is discussed in the All 6 Inserts article more clearly, read that!<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Away Put Your Weapon -http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/awayputyourweapon.html<br>
<br>
This used to find it&#146;s way into all of my light side decks.  Then, it got less and less useful do to all the high-demanding card spaces in decks.  But now, with Maul, Vader, and Mara running around wielding their fun-toys, I think this card is more useful than ever.  And with a 5 destiny, how could you go wrong?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Closer?! - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/closer.html<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve noticed that many Watch Your Step decks (I think it&#146;s WYS...) use Asteroids and Rycar&#146;s Run.  This is a good thing, and with Closer?! you can complete it in 2 turns (relocate, move, move next turn).  Of course, you&#146;ll need a little luck not to get blown away, but hey it&#146;s all good!  Also, destiny 6 isn&#146;t bad at all.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Control - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/control.html<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve noticed that decks nowadays drain for about 10 at each site in turn 3.  Ok... maybe not THAT much but it&#146;s a lot.  So basically, this card makes their drains all = 1.  That&#146;s a good thing.  The combo card is better, of course, but it&#146;s the principle of the thing!  This card was big, but not used enough anymore.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Effective Repairs - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/effectiverepairs.html<br>
<br>
Maybe it&#146;s just me, but whenever I play Rescue The Princess or Echo Base Operations they always seem to cancel Echo Base Garrison on me and I can&#146;t pull out 8D8, Bantha Droid, Zev, Hobbie... well not anymore!  Use this card and pull that card out of your lost pile!  AHAHAHA!  And with Echo Base Operations, just pull that out of your reserve deck.  Not bad I would say.  Also useful for cancelling Limited Resources, a card that is still regularly played here.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Egregious Pilot Error - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/large/egregiouspiloterror.html<br>
<br>
This card is very very useful against those damn Big Blue decks that are running rampant nowadays.  And with Bossk In Hounds Tooth floating around, too, then this is even better.  Use Electrobinoculars or track a low destiny, then use this and strand his lone ship, be it Boba In Slave One or a TIE Interceptor.  THEN BEAT THE HELL OUT OF HIM AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Oh sorry... I get carried away.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Han&#146;s Toolkit - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/hanstoolkit.html<br>
<br>
I love this card.  It cancels stuff like Lateral Damage (I think... does it?), Relentless Pursuit, and countless other hindering interrupts and effects.  It&#146;s like Haash&#146;n but better since it can be pulled with Portable Scanner.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hiding In The Garbage - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/hidinginthegarbage.html<br>
<br>
This is and always will be one of my favorite cards.  Why is that?  Well, it&#146;s like tunnel vision on and endless, little more limited extent.  Did you just activate your card you were looking for?  Use this, find it, deploy it!  It KILLS ALL.  I&#146;m surprised at how awesome this card is, and it has yet to be errated.  It&#146;s SWEET, and with all the activation that the light side gets now, it&#146;s even better.  I love it.  Please read that card, you&#146;ll be AMAZED at how sweeeeeeettttttttttt it is.  Believe you me.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I Have A Bad Feeling About This - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/ihaveabadfeelingaboutthis.html<br>
<br>
One of my other all-time favorites.  This card can be used to retarget effects and that the dark side uses all the time, like Presence of the Force, Lateral Damage, Relentless Pursuit, and several other effects and interrupts.  It&#146;s all too useful, and it will severly hurt many popular decks nowadays, as well as not-so-popular decks.  It rocks.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Polarized Negative Power Coupling - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/large/polarizednegativepower.html<br>
<br>
This card is very very sweet.  Let&#146;s say you&#146;re playing MBO and you are always activating that one crucial card and never can pull it out.  Well, this let&#146;s you see where it is floating around.  Is it in your used pile?  Look!  If not, draw it up.  If it is, save the force and use it to deploy a big beatdown squad.  This can also be used for tracking.  Albeit it is a little tricky, but you can count how much it will be when you flip it and then track it that way.  It works very well once you get good at it.  It&#146;s very cool.  It&#146;s also very very VERY good with Visored Vision, which I will discuss later.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Tunnel Vision - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/tunnelvision.html<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, many people use this card.  And it&#146;s even combined with Control in the combo card from Reflections II, which is even better.  But I think this card is EXCELLENT in ANY deck.  It speeds them up more than you can imagine, and it allows you to keep most of your cards still in your life force, which is even better.  Do you activate a lot in your deck?  USE THIS CARD?  Are you playing a slow deck like MBO/Profit (for sites)/Rescue The Princess/every other deck?  Then PLAY THIS CARD.  I as of now am playing 4 copies of it in my Profit deck.  It really rocks house.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Visored Vision - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/visoredvision.html<br>
<br>
This is also one of my favorites.  Although the destiny is a bit too low for the usefulness of this card, it&#146;s still worth the card slot.  Does your opponent like playing the same interrupt over and over again, and you&#146;ve already used your grabber?  Well, play this and make them lose them all!  Not bad.  Or, play 1 to make them lose a force for each one they have, then another to make them lose those cards.  Say they have 2 All Power To Weapons in their used pile (you can even see with Polarized Negative Power Coupling...) then you play 2.  That&#146;s you losing 1 force to make them lose 4 force, 2 of which essential to their strategy.  Not bad I&#146;d say.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Yoda Stew - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/dagobah/light/small/yodastew.html<br>
<br>
This card is fantastic.  The combo card is as good... but this isn&#146;t reflections 2 now is it?  Anyways, this card is extremely useful for tracking, circulation, activation, and to avoid troublesome cards like Miyoom Onith.  I think you can figure out how cool this is, I just wanted to bring it to your attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There you have it.  My Dagobah edition of my article series.  I hope you enjoyed it, and please tell me what I should do for the next one, CLOUD CITY! (I&#146;ve gotten nothing but CC in my Reflections packs... suck!).<br>
