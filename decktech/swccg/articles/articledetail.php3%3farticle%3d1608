<br>
Some of my favorite game losing mistakes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are old father William,&quot; the young man said.<br>
&quot;And your hair has become very white.<br>
 Yet you incessantly stand on your head.<br>
 Do you think, at your age, it is right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In my youth,&quot; father William replied to his son<br>
&quot;I feared it might damage the brain.<br>
 But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,<br>
 Why I do it again and again...&quot;<br>
<br>
I have noticed certain self-defeating behaviors that people can't seem to help repeating.  I am not talking about one-time mistakes here -- ones that are based on ignorance or temporary lack of concentration. I am talking about the mistakes that people make again and again -- even though they might be aware of them.	I have grouped them into two major categories: Preparation errors and Game day mistakes.  Preparation errors occur in deck building and play testing (or lack thereof). Many of the game day errors could also be recognized and avoided with proper play testing but they really are not linked to deck or card choices.<br>
<br>
Preparation Errors:<br>
As I said above, these are the errors people make in getting ready to play. Usually they are deck construction problems. Most often they involve succumbing to temptation of big gains or (easy defense against opponents' big gains) at the expense of probability and common sense.<br>
<br>
1. This may have some unpleasant side effects... Effect mania:<br>
<br>
This is a great favorite of mine. There seems to be an effect for almost every situation these days and it is very tempting to take them all. Worried about odds? There's an odds killer. Don't like Operatives? We have one for that. Afraid of Visage? No problem, we have an effect for that.  Before you know it, you have a deck with a starting location, 3 signals (or Tw'ileks or whatever) and 56 effects and you have no idea how to trim it down to only 30 effects without exposing yourself to Dark Deal or EV-99 or EBO or some other thing. Of course I am exaggerating but not by all that much.  I have been guilty of it myself.  You wind up with deck well stocked with cards that are really only useful as a response to something that your opponent may or may not try. Wasted deck space = bad.<br>
Another fun side effect of effect mania is that you wind up with so many effects on the table that you can't remember which ones you have down or what they do.  How often do players forget to add one when they have oppressive enforcement on the table and draw a Dreadnought or Star Destroyer for destiny? To some extent this kind of problem can be solved with practice. But another possible solution would be to get rid of the effects. That's right, dump 'em all. Maybe keep your starting effect(s) and a couple grabbers but let go of the rest. Try to figure out how to use your deck's natural strengths to counter the strategies you fear. If you just can't do it without the effect, put it back in. I am not seriously recommending that you go to tournaments with no effects but think hard before you put it in. And remember -- effects are deployed. That leaves one less card in your life force.  If the card is not going to help you, you may as well throw it in your lost pile.<br>
<br>
2. I have failed me for the last time... Self Choke<br>
<br>
Destiny zero sucks doesn't it? Everyone hates drawing zero for battle and weapon destiny. Too many people solve this by reducing the number of locations in their deck. Very often, people will count on their opponents to provide force and their decks disintegrate when the opponent not only does not provide force, but also includes tricks to make deployment more expensive.	I see this again and again.<br>
If possible, it is best not to rely on your opponent to do anything for you. Provide yourself with enough force generating cards and ways to get them.<br>
Another great self-strangulation tool is Battle Order/Battle Plan. This has been commented on many times (see Old Skooler's Double Edged Swords, for instance) but I would be remiss if I did not mention it. I have won many tournament games simply because my opponent deployed one of these cards and I was able to keep him off the ground or out of space.<br>
Choking yourself out of a chance to win the game is as clumsy as it is stupid.<br>
<br>
3. &quot;Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've created...&quot; The House of Cards:<br>
<br>
What I am talking about here is the temptation to go for the ultimate card combo. You know the type. It only requires 8 or 9 cards, 5 turns to set up and an opponent who is dumb enough to walk right into it. This is a big rookie mistake.  It looks cool. It could win you the game, if it works. And it worked every time in play testing against your friend who only plays using decks that you give him and never goes to tournaments.	These things are usually just too card intensive to be very effective.	Also they are often geared towards taking out your opponents mains or something.<br>
Well mains are just cards. Your object is to make your opponent lose force. If he loses 1 copy each of Luke, Leia, Han and Obi, that's just 4 cards. Usually he has other copies to deploy anyway and, if you used 6 cards and ate drains for 3 turns to get this done, it probably hurt you more than him.<br>
My advice here is to resist the temptation. Combos are great but keep it simple and pay attention to card efficiency.  Only use combo cards if they have a useful function when the combo is broken up. If that function is as a high destiny card, make sure you have a reliable way to get the card back into your reserve deck.<br>
<br>
Game Day Mistakes:<br>
As I said above, these are the mistakes you make on the day of the game. You have built great decks and have well conceived plans but the rest of the world refuses to cooperate.  Your opponent wants to win too. These are some good ways to help him do it:<br>
<br>
1. &quot;I am altering the deal...&quot; Change of Plans<br>
<br>
The mistake I am talking about here is the mistake of playing your opponent's game instead of your own. Your opponent starts some combo that you dread and you feel that you must go and disrupt it in order to have a chance.  In order to do this, you abandon your overall game plan and somehow just never get back to it. This is a common mistake against Operative decks, ROPs decks, Profit Decks, Dark Deal Decks, any deck that poses a significant threat if it is allowed to get set up.<br>
Now this is only a big mistake with certain kinds of decks. Some decks are created for the exclusive purpose of disrupting the opponent's strategy. The No Shelter type decks are great for this, as are Balanced Huntdown and other Balanced Mains and Toys decks.  However, with other decks, it is important to remain calm and do the math. If there is any way to win by using your own deck strategy, that is the way to go. You usually can't beat a good player at his own game, unless it is your game too.	Interaction is all the rage these days. I like it myself but, if your deck does not naturally interact with your opponents (e.g., you are mainly space and he is mainly ground, you are playing walkers outside and he is playing mains inside), then try to think of a way to avoid going to him or make him come to you.<br>
<br>
2. &quot;The admiral has brought the fleet out of hyperspace too soon.&quot; Premature Deployment<br>
<br>
This is another one I am often guilty of. Putting cards on the table before you are ready is a big mistake.  I mean all kinds of cards -- Locations, Characters, Blue Cards, Effects, and even weapons.  This is especially true in a balanced deck where it is important to know what your opponent is doing before you commit yourself too heavily.<br>
A common situation is Wakeelmui in a SFS deck. You deploy Wakeelmui with only one Tie fighter or no starships at all and SFS. Next turn your opponent deploys Tantive 4 and Wedge and some friends and crushes your lone Tie. Now all your Starships are deploying +2 and your SFS gets Altered. Oops. If you had waited a turn or 2, it all would have happened differently.  Another situation I see a lot is grabbing the wrong interrupt with your Push or Hell To Pay.   Of course the early deployment of Battle Plan/Battle Order is often a mistake.<br>
Well you can imagine the variety of other circumstances where Premature Deployment is a problem. It is often related to the &quot;Change of Plans&quot; problem above. It is especially tricky because sometimes quick and decisive action is the only thing that can help you.  For most people experience is the only real cure for this problem. The only other advice I have is to weigh the pros and cons carefully and do the math. Rash behavior is usually more harmful than cautious behavior. Be bold but not stupid.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. &quot;Your friend's quite a mercenary.&quot; Emotional Rescue<br>
<br>
This is often a problem for newer or more casual players; but I have seen veterans fall into it as well. It seems to stem from an emotional attachment to power cards -- especially characters and starships. The attachment remains even after their value in the game is gone. The example I see most often is with the Executor. Once you have fewer than 15 life force (or 12 with the DS2 one) and no means of retrieval, this card is useless. Yet I see player lose cards from their reserve deck or useful cards from hand after the life force is down to 9 or 10 and when the game is over, it turns out that they were holding an extra Vader and an Executor.  If you can't play a card, it is useless to you except as life force or discard fodder. Everyone knows this, I think; but it is very hard to think dispassionately about the power cards.<br>
A subtler version of this is the inability of some players to abandon their already deployed mains and beefy blue stuff. Sometimes the best way to win is to let Leia die and spread out the weenies somewhere else to sneak in some drains. It's not noble or exciting but you are your life force -- not your characters. Again, do the math. Assess your chances of winning if you keep reinforcing a big battle location or if you pursue other options. Consider your opponent's deck and his remaining like force and activation capability. If probability favors letting the valiant characters go down, just remind yourself: &quot;Better her than me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Like old father William, many of us do these things repeatedly despite the fact that they are self-defeating.  He has the excuse of being &quot;perfectly sure&quot; he has no brain.  I think that, for many SWCCG players, there is a similar kind of acceptance of these repeatable errors. &quot;I always do that.&quot; &quot;This is probably a mistake but...&quot; &quot;I always forget to subtract 2&quot;<br>
Strangely, this is where the &quot;It's only a game&quot; cliche works in favor of the serious player. The serious player knows that it is indeed a game and it does not matter at all whether Obi-wan wins a battle or the princess gets rescued. If you have cards in your life force and your opponent does not, you win (sorry -- I had to say it). I think that, most often, the best antidote to these chronic errors is to remind yourself of that fact, do the math, and play the percentages. Yes you are playing Star Wars; but you are also playing cards.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have answered three questions and that is enough&quot;<br>
Said his father. &quot;Don't give yourself airs.<br>
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?<br>
Be off or I'll kick you downstairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well maybe not three questions...<br>
