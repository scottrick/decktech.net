A decktech member ( Wraith 3 ) brought it to my attention<br>
that no one has written an article on Destiny Tracking and<br>
asked me if I would do it so here it is.<br>
<br>
Destiny tracking is one of those little things that can win<br>
you a game and make you and your deck look better then it<br>
is. Its actually one of the easiest things to do but most<br>
people don't take the time to work on it.<br>
<br>
I'm not a great destiny tracker but I'm okay. The way I<br>
learned it was from working the bottom up. Play Shocking<br>
Information and it recycles so it is now on the bottom of<br>
the pile. You activate and anticipate how much destinies you<br>
need : 1 for Sense  , 2 for Lightsaber swing , 1 for Battle<br>
destiny and line it up where you want it. All you have to<br>
be able to do to track destiny is to count to a certain<br>
number	between 0 and 60 and then fluctuate your activation<br>
to get the cards you want where. The card is # 17 ? Activate<br>
7 force for two turns and when you drop and battle you have<br>
that destiny as your first battle destiny after you use<br>
card #15 and 16 for weapon destinies.<br>
<br>
You'll notice that a lot of the better decks have easily<br>
recycling destinies but they also have a good purpose. Take<br>
a look at the Martin Falke deckThat has a bunch of easily<br>
recycling destinies that can be tracked very easily and<br>
used to a.) win a 'wager' with Figrin b. ) get a good weapon<br>
destiny or c.) get a good battle destiny. He's not wasting<br>
card slots to get insane destiny using things like Bionic<br>
Hand or something that is there JUST for destinyhe's using<br>
easy recyclers to hopefully get an edge.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at smaller part of my No Shelter designs :<br>
Shocking Information. How did a deck with like 13 characters<br>
win ? Savrip helped a bit but I would set those 5 and 6s in<br>
motion and when Vader and Tarkin comes down  Lightsaber<br>
destiny on Tarkin is a 4  'would you like to cancel ?' it's<br>
a tough call because they know I've been playing Weapon<br>
Levitations and Shocking Informations but they really weren't<br>
counting where it was were they ? Suddenly you wish you were<br>
counted when your looking at your 3rd Vader about to bite the<br>
dust. Corellia along with TJ Holman and Joe Alread are pretty<br>
well known for using recyclers like  Dark Manuevers or things<br>
like that for easy 6 destinies. Holman and Alread are both<br>
former World Finalists and destiny tracking is one of the<br>
things they do well.<br>
<br>
Now you must be wondering  how can I harness this power ?<br>
<br>
The only way to do it is to practice by yourself  until you<br>
are proficient. The opponent won't exactly go right after<br>
you if you've been counting your reserve deck for the past<br>
3 turns.  So you'll wanna just activate and do normal game<br>
functions while trying to track destinies. The best way to<br>
learn is to use a deck with multiples of How Did We Get Into<br>
This Mess (HDWGITM) . When you put your hand back arrange<br>
the #s from highest on the bottom to lowest on the top and<br>
try targeting certain numbers for destiny. Then next time<br>
you play HDWGITM arrange it from lowest destiny on the bottom<br>
to highest destiny on the top and then try to know where<br>
the high destiny group between your reserve deck. This is<br>
the easiest exercise to get your destiny tracking skills<br>
working. You won't be able to track both players reserve<br>
decks like Bastian Winkelhaus but you'll be able to test<br>
your skills against the weaker players in your area and then<br>
use them to give the tougher players in your area a bit more<br>
of a challenge.<br>
<br>
Until next article...See you on the flip side.<br>
