I myself learned recently that this isn&#146;t always the best solution. I was light side, playing a Bothawui Operative deck, and my opponent was playing a BHBM deck, which basically used the objective as an activation platform so they could make huge beatdowns. We were playtesting deck designs for an upcoming tournament, so we played many times. <br>
<br>
The basic concept of my deck was to flip Local Uprising and get the retrieval bonus, all while getting Tessek set up at the Audience chamber with Bo Shuda, making all my Operatives deploy for free and add 2 to their force drains. I used H&#146;nemthes and Goo Nee Tay to keep his characters off of Bothawui.<br>
<br>
The first time we played, I deployed Home One: DB and occupied it with a lone H&#146;nemthe, hoping he didn&#146;t have any spies and that I could get a quick extra 2 activation. Unfortunately, by turn 3 he was activating 15 and he dropped Arica, Xizor and Guri and then battled. Suffice it to say, I lost some force, and later the game. (By 26 force)<br>
<br>
Second time we played, I got out all my sites, and deployed a little more warily to the docking bays, but I made the mistake of becoming impatient again and dropped an operative with a 2 power, 2 ability scrub and trying for the quick drain. Again, with approx. 30 force built up he dropped plenty of power cards and again, I lost the game, this time by 30 force.<br>
<br>
The third time, I corrected my past mistakes. I waited until I had my effect base on the table (Bacta Tank, Bargaining Table, Uh Oh), until I had Tessek set up w/ Bo Shuda, and until I could back up my Operatives once they were out. I got my objective flipped, started force draining for 3 at every site. I won that game, by 19 force.<br>
<br>
The basic idea I&#146;m trying to convey is that if you&#146;ve got a deck based around a specific strategy, don&#146;t start that strategy into motion without being able to defend it well. Take your time, get your forces ready to support where you need them. Once you get your strategy started, there&#146;s no turning back.<br>
<br>
The best example of this is the way many people play This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time. Many try to get the objective flipped as fast as possible and to get drains going at super speed. This is much less effective, because the opponent can simply take their time, eat the force loss for 1-2 turns, then deploy, kill you, cancel Dark Deal, and flip your objective back. And then, you&#146;re screwed. Your deck&#146;s entire strategy base has just been knocked out, and you can&#146;t do a thing about it. The alternative to this, is to put off deploying for a couple of turns, and get the correct characters in your hand, as well as a couple of battle gimmicks. Once you&#146;ve got everything you need, you deploy and HOLD the system and sites. Then you&#146;ll be draining for the rest of the game, not just the first few turns.<br>
<br>
Overall, the idea is patience. Don&#146;t try to go for the quick kill, because you&#146;ll only be screwing yourself. Focus your energy on making your deck&#146;s strategy work, instead of playing into your opponents hand. Now, most of you veteran players know this already, but for all those newbies out there, keep in mind: It may not necessarily be the deck you&#146;re playing, but how quickly you&#146;re trying to play it. Good luck! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
