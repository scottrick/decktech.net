<br>
Some of us like surprises, others don't. In SWCCG I think it's fair to say that most opponents don't like them, and this is particularly true when playing against the best players. In fact, if you want to beat the best players then your best bet is with a surprise because otherwise, when it comes down to a test of who plays better in a telegraphed situation, chances are he's going to win. Many players may put down a loss to a 'worse' player as bad luck, or bad deck matchup, and while these do play a part I'm going to argue that the element of surprise can be a far, far more important component.<br>
<br>
The number of possible decks out there is huge; a number so big it is difficult to contemplate (I tried to work this out but my calculator could not handle it!). However, we only ever see so many and the number of 'decktypes' (e.g. Hunt Down, Ralltiir Ops, Hidden Base, etc.) is surprisingly limited. Into these different categories we can break the deck description down further - Hunt Down: Dueling or Hidden Base: OMDH Retrieval perhaps. This idea was touched on in a couple of very interesting articles published earlier this month by Dominique Garant - 'Trust Your Deck' and 'Sorry Yoda, There Is A Try'. However, I am going to expand upon this now and link it to game strategy. Although decks vary a little, most of the decks to be found on a site like Decktech or in the Trandosite archives are in fact very similar. As Mr. Garant points out, when reviewers on Decktech look at a deck they look for familiar cards missing and strange cards included and then advise the deck-owner to exchange one for the other. Where I disagree with Mr. Garant is that this is not always a bad thing. In fact, this can often be quite a good thing in making decks more powerful and giving less experienced players (or even some pretty decent players) a better tournament performance. However, when it comes to playing the very cream of the region your deck will suffer because of its predictability. The top players get where they are not only because of their inherent playing skill, but because they have played against the most common decktypes so many times that they know exactly how to beat them. Particularly when they are being played by a lower ranked player. The combination of natural skill and great knowledge is certainly one to be feared.<br>
<br>
How can we get round this problem? Do we ever stand any chance of being able to beat those top players in the region? Well, of course we do! If you can include a surprise in your deck, something that might be a little bit unexpected, then this can give you the edge.<br>
<br>
So, what kind of surprises are there? Being non-conformist can take many different routes. Firstly, I would like to address the bad route. The nasty surprises that backfire on you. Including cards that are too specific, even though they may be surprising and the opponent will not have accounted for them, will not help you. The Emperor's Prize is a good example of this; I saw someone trying to use this the other day. It's biting off way more than you can chew to hedge your bets on this, even today with more ways of capturing, etc. If you've never seen another soul use a card, then there's probably a good reason for that. Make sure you can judge whether the surprise factor of a card outweighs its apparent poor quality.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I would warn you that some things may seem surprising but aren't really. Reacting, for example. The Spiral is not ever a surprise to a good player. If you leave the Tantive IV on its own with a few Force left in your Force Pile then trust me, they're going to know what's coming (or at least suspect it and plan for it). What's worse is that they might then be able to through the situation back at you (e.g. Imperial Barrier, It Can Wait, First Strike). Well known tricks may be worth trying, because if they come off then it doesn't matter if it was telegraphed or not, but they are not the focus of this article.<br>
<br>
And now, we get onto some of the cards and ideas that I would like to draw your attention to. However, although I will mention some it perhaps goes without saying that I cannot mention most - or that'd surely limit their surprise value?? Have a look through your cards, have a look at some of those decks where before you thought 'take out unknown X for known Y' and have a think.<br>
<br>
Individual Cards<br>
<br>
Under Attack is the card that springs to mind for me. Few dark side players meta for this, even at the top level, because it is so rarely used. Most players I use it against don't even know what it does; and as an added bonus it's a used interrupt of destiny 6 which can't be too bad. Increasingly, the dark side have been using vehicles to hide away from permanent weapons and - while this trend has slightly been halted by the introduction of enhanced dark characters - it's still true to say that most dark side decks pack AT-ATs or AT-STs. Ralltiir Ops is perhaps the most popular of dark side strategies running around on the Internet at the moment, and this in particular uses combat vehicles to an extreme. Take Martin Akessons excellent ROps deck - which packs six AT-STs - or Gary Carman's worlds deck which had similar numbers of AT-ATs. Even Hunt Down - a popular favorite for decades it feels - uses them; see Clint Hays' deck that takes advantage of the most popular duo of Blizzard 2 and Tempest 1. This latter card is perhaps the most feared of all the dark side's combat vehicles because of the popular combo with its matching pilot, Igar. So, getting rid of these cards is handy and Under Attack really does make it easy when used with the EPPs Luke or Obi (or, at a push, Daughter of Skywalker with Anakin's Saber - I have seen this around). Getting rid of an AT-ST is simple you can normally pull it off without even having to destiny track. Eliminating an AT-AT is a little bit more difficult, but a tracked DFTD or even a Shocking Info can normally do the trick. Used in combination with something like the ASP/Portable Scanner/Ewok Catapult trick and you're laughing. Great surprise value and a card that will always be useful; it isn't immune to Sense though so be careful with the timing of your actions.<br>
<br>
Stone Pile is a good example, which was again mentioned by Mr. Garant in his article. If you're playing with a Dagobah start then this is truly a card to consider. Although you can't control what cards go under, there's very little the opponent can do to get those cards back and if you take a critical card then he's really in trouble. Opponents may plan for Grimtaash and make sure their hand size stays below 13. They will certainly plan for cards like Scanning Crew, perhaps including a few Shocking Information or a grabber card. But who's going to plan for Stone Pile? In a recent tournament I was running, I saw a player use Stone Pile and took Come Here You Big Coward out of the game. He was using a very unusual and original Dagobah Clouds drain deck; CHYBC was the counter most top players would pack and so the element of surprise he needed was that Stone Pile. Interesting maneuver. With MWHYL, the danger of Sense is also reduced.<br>
<br>
Once you've lost a game because of Sandwhirl, you'll never make that mistake again but it's amazing how many players fall into this trap. There are many decks that pack the generic locations and include the Desert - Imperial Occupation-based decks and Ralltiir Ops spring to mind and as these account for quite a large percentage of decks it is worth discussing the benefits of Sandwhirl here. This card was originally suggest to me by Gary C, so due credit to him, and many thanks for pointing out how lethal this could be! When playing against mains, it's amazing how easily tempted they are to take up the opportunity of a beatdown. If you can arrange this at the Desert, then it can be game over in one turn. In a recent game I was playing against a very strong player unaware of the Sandwhirl power, I lured him to Ralltiir by leaving Admiral Motti on a Dune Walker (not hugely powerful). He came down with Leia, Han and Chewie and gave Motti a bit of a beating (nothing I couldn't handle, even without a Ghhhk). Next turn, I activate three, pull the Sandwhirl out of my deck using Twi'Lek Advisor and all those characters go missing for the rest of the game. Few light side decks pack vehicles, and once I had another Dune Walker there I was pretty confident that they were dead. Now, imagine how easy that makes it for the dark side player! A mains deck without Han, Leia or Chewie! That only left him a few characters left, and it cost me but very few force. Of course, Control can stop this tactic but this has seen massive decline in use post-Special Edition. I very very rarely see it now.<br>
<br>
Imperial Supply is not one that might spring to mind, but I feel it's worth considering. In order to get to play at the top and win tournaments, players will have to take risks and often this will involve ignoring the possibility the opponent is going to use a card like Imperial Supply to boost his activation (other card that do this include Any Methods Necessary and Blue Milk but neither are as significant as IS). A card such as this allows you to jump on the opponent when he doesn't suspect it, and that is surely the definition of the element of surprise? It can also alter your decks setup speed, which makes it less predictable. If your opponent is used to decktype A taking six turns to set up then he will often play with this in mind; so if you can get it setup in four or five turns it can make all the difference. At the Grand Slam, Bastian Winkelhaus used this card to great effect against me in a practice game where he managed to get This Deal setup against me before I could possibly have planned (although I did manage to pull that one back I'm very proud to say!). In my own ISB deck, which suffered if it lost speed, I stocked several and used that to win my first tournament back in August 1999. I have also seen it in some of the best operative decks in the world; such as those by John Shields and Clint Hays (both World Finalists). This card rocks; and although one might argue that if so many top players use it then the surprise factor is lost I would also argue back that, whilst it might be considered, few players even at the highest level, will be able to account for it especially at the start of games.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of other cards which your opponent might expect you to pack but can still launch a nasty surprise on them just because of their shock-factor element; I will divide this into two kinds - the first being power-alter and the second being removal=big smack (in tribute to a great article by Neal Razi). Power-alter cards include those that, well, alter your or your opponents power. For the former, they include destiny adders such as Gift of the Mentor or I Know (that has some wonderful surprise in it for sure) and for the latter, Lateral Damage and Mechanical Failure are the beasts. Removal=big smack refers to cards that focus 'on reducing the opponent's power rather than increasing yours' (N Razi). Principle examples include Clash of Sabers/You Are Beaten (if you have lightsabers, you must have these), Dr. Evazan, Trample, Obi-Wan Kenobi, X-Wing Laser Cannon, Choke Vader and Under Attack (mentioned earlier in more depth). I would also like to enhanced upon Mr. Razi's theme by drawing attention to a group of cards that can have the same effect but instead of removing power that is already present works to prevent that power from getting to the table in time. I refer to those that prevent 'reacts' - Romas Lock Nevander, Corporal Beezer, Command Nemet, Sense, and Lt. Arnet spring to mind. I mentioned at the start of this article that you should not consider the Spiral as a surprise, and here's why. It's so predictable that the surprise is in stopping it, and then working it against the opponent. This worked well for me recently, when someone left their Tantive IV against my Devastator and Officer Evax expecting to react with the Spiral next turn. Down comes Nemet and Lateral Damage on my turn (both cards mentioned in this article) and battle damage is horrendous.<br>
<br>
Deck Themes<br>
<br>
Other than individual cards you can pack, there are some deck themes that can give you the surprise advantage against a top player. Some of this will involve looking at the local meta, seeing what is popular and building your entire deck around that. For example, the trend I have noticed is for Throne Room decks to become increasingly ground based with no account for space at all (for example, Martin Schumacher's Ewok Catapult deck which came runner-up in the German Grand Slam) and also we're seeing more and more Revolutions. The most extreme counter to this, perhaps, is to play space. You can build a deck to specifically counter what the best players are playing but I would say that this is to be avoided. Being able to beat the best players is fine, but principally you should look to bring a deck that will get you results against players of your own ability and lower. It's no good being confident of beating the guy in the lead with his ground-based mains and toys if you're in last place with your high drain space deck. This method - which is the second most employed after copying the best players decks (which makes it very predictable) - has faults, but is worthy of mention.<br>
<br>
Of more value is including low-card-combo themes. There are few things that are worse in a deck than massive, hard to pull off combos imho. Too many new players and young players try to do more than they can in the game - such as trying to flip Carbon Chamber Testing when in fact it is best to ignore freezing entirely. However, low-card-combos can be the surprises you need - such as the ASP droids using high destiny weapons/devices to fix destinies and combining with cards like Sorry About The Mess, Under Attack, etc. Another example is Dark Jedi Presence/Trooper Assault. If you're using a trooper deck, e.g. Raithal Ops/Inserts, then just slipping this in can be a game winner (a prime example where surprise is the key to defeating top players).<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
SWCCG has become such a complex web of strategy, tactical analysis and pyschological warfare that, as with any article, I have only begun to touch on the theme which I discuss. However, I believe a concluding summary is required to streamline my ideas for you and turn the chaos of analysis into a coherent conclusion. When you start off playing, your main aim will not be to beat the best players in your region. However, once you have progressed to a position where you are playing (and losing to) these players on a regular basis in tourneys then I would advise you to consider the element of surprise as the key to your victory. Top players know the normal decktypes and, although they may look good on paper, they can end up being too predictable. By introducing some surprising factors to your deck, some of which have been discussed above, you will give yourself a much better chance of beating those top players and of winning tournaments. Never forsake the general quality of your deck however, or this policy will undoubtedly backfire on you. It's a knife-edge, but that's what makes the game fun, right? ;)<br>
