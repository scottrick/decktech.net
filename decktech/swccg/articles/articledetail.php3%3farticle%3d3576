<br>
 After the opening crawl, Senator Padme&#146;s (Natalie Portman) starship<br>
 and it&#146;s convoy are approaching Coruscant. When the Nubian ship<br>
 supposedly carrying Padme lands, disguised handmaiden Cordé<br>
 (played by Veronica Segura) walks down the ramp with her entourage<br>
 and suddenly there&#146;s a huge explosion near the ramp. Padme, who<br>
 was riding in one of the Nubian&#146;s escort fighters, runs to her and they<br>
 exchange a few quick words before Corde dies. Padme has a quick<br>
 discussion with Captain Typho (played by Jay Laga&#146;aia) about what to<br>
 do and then Padme goes to her living quarters. <br>
<br>
 When she arrives safely in her apartment on Coruscant, she calls<br>
 longtime friend Jar Jar Binks, who&#146;s official title is now Representative<br>
 Jar Jar Binks of the Gungans. In the Senate, Jar Jar stands with<br>
 Senator Padme on the Naboo platform. After the Nubian ship was<br>
 destroyed, Uv Gizen - Supreme Chancellor Palpatine&#146;s personal aide -<br>
 tells Palpatine that Senator Padme is dead. The Senate later<br>
 convenes on the matter at hand: voting on whether or not to create a<br>
 clone army for the Republic. Palpatine starts to speak, &quot;My esteemed<br>
 colleagues, I have received some tragic and disturbing news.&quot; He is<br>
 about to announce Padme&#146;s death, but to his surprise, Padme shows<br>
 up and says that she&#146;s ok. <br>
<br>
 She voices her opinions about the lack of safety in the galaxy and the<br>
 Senate spends the rest of this meeting dwelling on this topic.<br>
 Palpatine resolves the issue of Padme&#146;s safety by assigning two Jedi<br>
 Knights to protect her. He asks Mace Windu to specifically assign<br>
 Obi-Wan and Anakin to this task. Shortly after comes a meeting in a<br>
 small room on Coruscant. In the room are Senator Toonbuck Toora,<br>
 Senator Darsana, Senator Askaak, Bail Organa (played by Jimmy<br>
 Smits), Jar Jar Binks, and Palpatine. They are discussing the idea of<br>
 cloning an army for the Republic. Most everyone in the room is for the<br>
 clone army except Bail Organa and Jar Jar Binks.<br>
<br>
 Bail is undecided, but Jar Jar is definitely against it. In this scene,<br>
 Palpatine says something like &quot;Sometimes we have to break the law<br>
 in order to act in its best interest.&quot; (Not a direct quote). Clearly, he is<br>
 saying that they must create the Republic clone army whether or not<br>
 the Senate favors the decision. Then comes the second meeting in<br>
 the Senate, in which they discuss purely the idea of creating a clone<br>
 army for the Republic. <br>
<br>
 Palpatine urges everyone to vote for it. He is backed up by Senator<br>
 Toonbuck Toora of the Commerce Guild, Senator Orn Free Taa and<br>
 the Intergalactic Bank Clan who offer to put up the cash. Bail Organa<br>
 has a role in this scene as well. Senator Padme also speaks and she<br>
 votes for the army. Later that evening, there is another assassination<br>
 attempt on Padme in her apartment on Coruscant. Obi-Wan and<br>
 Anakin are standing guard at the door and they suddenly both sense<br>
 something weird. <br>
<br>
 The line &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot; is spoken and the two Jedi<br>
 burst into her quarters. There is a large droid hovering in Padme&#146;s<br>
 room that has released tons of small insect-like assassination robots<br>
 called kouhuns. Anakin runs to Padme and clears all the kouhuns off<br>
 her, meanwhile; Obi-Wan jumps out the window and onto the large<br>
 droid. When Zam Wesell, the bounty hunter - who&#146;s controlling the<br>
 assassination droid via remote control - brings the droid back to her,<br>
 she sees Obi-Wan dangling from the flying droid. She whips out her<br>
 gun and starts opening fire on Obi-Wan and the droid. Obi-Wan<br>
 takes out his lightsaber and starts deflecting her bolts. Zam continues<br>
 to fire - Obi-Wan continues to deflect.<br>
<br>
 Zam realizes she&#146;d better take off, so she gets on her speeder and<br>
 flies away. Anakin then picks up Obi-Wan in a yellow &quot;hot-rod&quot;<br>
 speeder and they take off after Zam, leading to the chase scene.<br>
 Anakin and Obi-Wan chase Zam Wesell at high speeds through the<br>
 heavy traffic of Coruscant. This is the only time in Episode II we see<br>
 Anakin&#146;s amazing piloting skills. The chase comes to an end at a<br>
 night club at the lower levels of Coruscant. As they attempt to enter,<br>
 the bouncer yells &quot;NO JEDI&quot; at them. Anakin attempts to use a mind<br>
 trick on the bouncer, but Obi-Wan stops him.<br>
<br>
 Anakin then reaches for his saber and lights it in the bouncer&#146;s face in<br>
 attempt to scare him away. The bouncer isn&#146;t frightened away, in fact<br>
 he grows double in size and gets ready to fight. Then Obi-Wan uses a<br>
 mind trick on him and the two Jedi enter the club. As they enter,<br>
 Obi-Wan says &quot;Anakin, you&#146;ll be the death of me.&quot; Once inside, they<br>
 are met with a young troublemaker named Elian Sleazebaggano<br>
 (played by Matt Doran). Elian tries to sell them some kind of drugs -<br>
 &quot;You want some death sticks? You want some death sticks?&quot; he says.<br>
 Obi-Wan replies with &quot;You should rethink your life.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Finally, Obi-Wan and Anakin catch Zam outside the club and begin to<br>
 interrogate her, trying to find out who she&#146;s working for and why they<br>
 want Padme dead. Zam gives up and says something like &quot;Ok, ok,<br>
 I&#146;ll talk,&quot; but before she says another word, Zam is assassinated by<br>
 Jango Fett&#146;s Kaminoan Kyber Dart. The weapon that kills Zam is<br>
 mysterious to the Jedi. Obi-Wan says to Anakin: &quot;There&#146;s only one<br>
 man who knows all about these underground weapons at this level of<br>
 Coruscant.&quot; (Not exact quote) Next, we cut to Obi-Wan and Anakin<br>
 walking into Dex&#146;s Diner. Dexter Jettster (played by Ronalk Falk) is a<br>
 very awkward alien with four arms. With three arms he reaches hugs<br>
 his long time friend Obi-Wan and with his other arm he shakes hands<br>
 with Anakin. <br>
<br>
 Obi-Wan asks Dexter about the weapon that killed Zam Wesell and<br>
 Dex tells him that it&#146;s called a &quot;Kyber Dart&quot; and it only comes from<br>
 the water planet Kamino. Now Episode II is in full swing. The two Jedi<br>
 return to Padme&#146;s quarters. After discussing the situation for a while<br>
 and meeting with the Jedi Council, it is decided that Anakin must<br>
 accompany Padme back to Naboo where she&#146;ll be safe and Obi-Wan<br>
 would go to Kamino to follow up on the clues of conspiracy he<br>
 obtained from Zam Wesell&#146;s murder. Before leaving for Kamino,<br>
 Obi-Wan goes to the Jedi Temple to seek information on the planet.<br>
 He goes to an area of the Temple in which archives of the Jedi order<br>
 are kept. <br>
<br>
 There he meets Jocasta Nu, a librarian and academic (played by<br>
 Alethea McGrath). Jocasta shows him a holographic map of Kamino<br>
 and they discuss the &quot;Lost Twenty&quot; - the only 20 Jedi to ever have left<br>
 the order. Among these 20 is Count Dooku, a former highly respected<br>
 Jedi Master. In this scene we see a bust of Dooku - a small statue of<br>
 his head. Jocasta Nu also mentions Qui-Gon a couple times. In the<br>
 sequence before Obi-Wan chats with Jocasta, there are some<br>
 establishing shots of the Jedi Temple. We get to see numerous Jedi<br>
 in training. One we focus in on is of Yoda and a bunch of Jedi<br>
 hopefuls (little kids) on a balcony. <br>
<br>
 Yoda is teaching them about the lightsaber. He pulls his out and<br>
 ignites it and says something like &quot;The lightsaber is a Jedi&#146;s most<br>
 precious weapon.&quot; Before setting off for Naboo on a public transport,<br>
 Anakin and Padme are bid farewell by Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar does not<br>
 go with them. They take to the stars and begin the journey. There are<br>
 many scenes in the ship that get the love story underway. The ship<br>
 they travel in is sort of like a scheduled flight between planets.<br>
 Anakin and Padme are not alone. There are a lot of aliens on this<br>
 ship. Naboo: Here we are introduced to Queen Jamillia (played by<br>
 Ayesha Dharker), the new ruler of Naboo. (Queen Jamillia only has<br>
 two scenes - very small character) <br>
<br>
 The love between Anakin and Padme grows as they spend more time<br>
 together on Naboo. They travel to a Lake Retreat and that&#146;s where<br>
 they meet Padme&#146;s family - her sisters (Keira Wingate - Haley Mooy)<br>
 and parents, Jobal (mother - (played by Claudia Karvan) and Ruwee<br>
 (father - played by Graeme Blundell). There are also scenes on<br>
 Naboo in a kitchen, Anakin&#146;s bedroom, and Padme&#146;s bedroom. At the<br>
 lake, Anakin tosses and turns in his bed and wakes up to a terrible<br>
 nightmare concerning his mother. The next morning, Padme enters<br>
 Anakin&#146;s room and find him on the balcony meditating. She turns to<br>
 leave and he tells her not to go. &quot;Your presence is soothing,&quot; is the<br>
 line. <br>
<br>
 Anakin&#146;s concern for his mother grows so strong that he decides to<br>
 leave Naboo with Padme and head for Tatooine. Anakin was under<br>
 strict orders by the Jedi Council to stay on Naboo - he disobeys.<br>
 Anakin and Padme make their way back to Theed where they meet<br>
 Queen Jamillia. They tell her they have to leave immediately and she<br>
 willingly gives them a ship. Anakin, Padme and R2 take off for<br>
 Tatooine. It is aboard this ship and on this journey through space<br>
 that Anakin and Padme share their first kiss. After his meeting with<br>
 Madame Jocasta Nu, Obi-Wan goes to Kamino on behalf of Palpatine<br>
 to uncover information about the conspiracy involving Count Dooku.<br>
 Since Palpatine is (in a way) behind the cloning on Kamino and<br>
 doesn&#146;t want Obi-Wan to discover what&#146;s happening there, he contacts<br>
 Count Dooku and tells him the Jedi Knight is on his way. <br>
<br>
 Dooku dispatches Jango Fett to assassinate Obi-Wan. When Obi-Wan<br>
 arrives (in a city called Tipoca), he&#146;s greeted by Lama Su (CG<br>
 character voiced by Anthony Phelan), the Prime Minister of the planet,<br>
 and taken to a conference room to discuss matters at hand. The<br>
 Kaminoans are very kind to Obi-Wan and they don&#146;t think there is<br>
 anything &quot;wrong&quot; with the cloning operation. Obi-Wan is then taken to<br>
 a laboratory and a cloning facility and he realizes this conspiracy runs<br>
 deeper than Dooku and the Kyber Dart. He asks Lama Su who<br>
 commissioned this cloning activity and Su tells him it was Master<br>
 Sido-Dyas. Immediately, Obi-Wan contacts the Jedi Council and<br>
 reports what he was told. <br>
<br>
 Yoda tells Obi-Wan to continue the investigation and try to find out<br>
 who Sido-Dyas is and who he&#146;s working for. Mace Windu speculates<br>
 that someone in the Senate may be involved and this secret army is<br>
 being created to start a war. Soon after, while Obi-Wan is in a cloning<br>
 hatchery, Jango Fett (played by Temuera Morrison) emerges and fires<br>
 at Obi-Wan. He misses. Obi-Wan lights his saber and starts to chase<br>
 him. He catches up to him on a landing platform in the pouring rain.<br>
 And so begins the rain battle on a landing platform where Slave I is<br>
 docked. The battle ends in a stalemate. <br>
<br>
 Jango takes off in Slave 1 and Obi-Wan manages to stick a seeker<br>
 pod on the side of the ship as it flies away. (In this scene, we get our<br>
 first glimpse at young Boba Fett - played by Daniel Logan.) Obi-Wan<br>
 gets in his ship and takes off into the sky in pursuit of Jango Fett in<br>
 Slave I. Soon, Jango realizes that Obi-Wan is on his tail so he takes<br>
 his ship into an asteroid field in attempt to lose him. Obi-Wan<br>
 follows. There is a hot chase scene through the asteroids where<br>
 Obi-Wan gets caught up in some trouble. Believing that Obi-Wan was<br>
 killed in the asteroid field, Jango and Boba proceed to their<br>
 destination - Geonosis.<br>
<br>
 Obi-Wan, of course, is not dead. When he finally makes it out of the<br>
 asteroid field he picks up Jango with the tracking device and<br>
 continues to follow him. As Jango and Obi-Wan approach Geonosis,<br>
 there are two droid control ships in orbit. Jango races up to one of<br>
 them and two fighters come out. To Jango&#146;s surprise, the fighters<br>
 start attacking him as well as Obi-Wan. Jango then makes his way to<br>
 the planet where he lands. Obi-Wan follows. Once on the ground,<br>
 Obi-Wan starts snooping around. <br>
<br>
 He finds out that the planet is run by an alien race that is creating<br>
 thousands of advanced battle droids. He sends out a distress call to<br>
 the Jedi, telling them that war is inevitable. The Jedi dispatch an army<br>
 to Geonosis and Palpatine contacts Count Dooku. He tells him<br>
 Obi-Wan has discovered the planet and that a Jedi army is on it&#146;s<br>
 way. Obi-Wan then continues to investigate the planet and he&#146;s<br>
 captured by droids and is taken prisoner.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Upon arriving on Mos Espa, Anakin, Padme and R2-D2 make their<br>
 way to Watto&#146;s shop. When they arrive, Watto is there. He is outside<br>
 his front door chasing a pit droid around. He is running on the ground<br>
 and flapping his wings hard, but he is unable to fly. He picks up a<br>
 stick and slaps the droid in the nose, causing it to fold up and stop<br>
 running around. Anakin, Padme and R2 approach him. Anakin tells<br>
 Watto who he is and that he&#146;s come for his mother. Watto tells<br>
 Anakin that she is now married to Cliegg Lars and they live out on a<br>
 moisture farm outside a city called Mos Eisley. <br>
<br>
 Anakin gets a speeder and he, Padme, and R2 hurry towards the city<br>
 Watto described. When they arrive at the Lars moisture farm, Anakin<br>
 meets Cliegg (played by Jack Thompson), Owen (played by Joel<br>
 Edgerton), and Beru (played by Bonnie Piesse). His mother is not<br>
 there and Anakin gets very concerned. Cliegg (who has one leg) tells<br>
 him that she went out into the desert earlier in the day to fetch<br>
 mushrooms that grow on moisture vaporators. She did not return at<br>
 the time she usually does so Cliegg formed a search party and went<br>
 out to find her. In the process, he failed and was badly injured by<br>
 tusken raiders. Most of the search party was killed. <br>
<br>
 Anakin jumps on Owen Lars&#146;s swoop bike and speeds out into the<br>
 desert. Padme runs after him yelling &quot;Anakin! Stop!&quot; After getting<br>
 directions from a Jawa along the way, Anakin heads into a hilly, rocky<br>
 region of the desert. When he finds his mom, she is being carried by<br>
 Tuskens. She is obviously badly wounded already. As Anakin<br>
 approaches, a Tusken suddenly turns around and slugs Shmi in the<br>
 stomach with his gaffi stick. Anakin sees this and screams as he<br>
 approaches. The Tuskens get spooked, they drop Shmi and take off.<br>
 Anakin runs to his mother and holds her in his lap. They exchange a<br>
 few words and she dies in his arms. Anakin is devastated. He blames<br>
 himself for her death. <br>
<br>
 He sits next to her in silence for a long time. He then digs a hole in<br>
 the sand and puts Shmi in it. He then covers the tomb in rocks.<br>
 Anakin sits on a top of a rocky hill all night near the place where he<br>
 buried his mother. He is in a meditative state, trying to calm his<br>
 flurried emotions. As the twin suns of Tatooine rise over the horizon.<br>
 Anakin catches a glimpse of two Tusken children playing in the<br>
 shadows below him. He watches them for a bit, then stands up.<br>
 Staring at them with a blank expression on his face, he reaches for<br>
 his saber, ignites it and walks towards them. When Anakin returns to<br>
 the Lars farm, he tells Cliegg Lars that he found his mother and she<br>
 was dead. Cliegg (who&#146;s still very injured) and Anakin have a<br>
 conversation that goes as such:<br>
<br>
 ANAKIN: If I hadn&#146;t gone away, none of this would have happened.<br>
 We&#146;d be happy. <br>
<br>
 CLIEGG LARS: But you&#146;d still be slaves. <br>
<br>
 ANAKIN: But at least she&#146;d still be alive and we&#146;d be happy. <br>
<br>
 As the conversation proceeds, they&#146;re kind of raising their voices at<br>
 each other. Anakin is obviously extremely jealous of his mother&#146;s love<br>
 for the Lars family. The argument stops when Padme puts a soft<br>
 hand on Anakin&#146;s shoulder. She takes him into the next room and<br>
 shows him C-3PO, who now has covers. (Padme, R2 and Owen added<br>
 then when Anakin was in the desert.) And so follows this dialogue: <br>
<br>
 PADME: Isn&#146;t he great? <br>
<br>
 ANAKIN:s He&#146;s perfect. <br>
<br>
 At or around this time, Padme and Anakin receive Obi-Wan&#146;s general<br>
 distress call from Geonosis. It becomes evident that Anakin does not<br>
 want to leave. Padme reminds him of their responsibilities to the<br>
 Republic and essentially tells him they have to go. Anakin takes<br>
 Padme, R2D2 and C-3PO with him. They head for Geonosis.<br>
 Geonosis: a planet run by an alien known as Poggle the Lesser. The<br>
 inhabitants of the planet specialize in making droid armies for the<br>
 Trade Federation. <br>
<br>
 These aliens look like a cross between Sebulba and Battle Droids.<br>
 They also have four thin wings on their backs similar to a dragonfly&#146;s.<br>
 Anakin, Padme, R2D2 and C-3PO arrive on Geonosis before the Jedi<br>
 army. When they land, Padme and Anakin get in an argument about<br>
 what to do (Anakin doesn&#146;t want to fight, Padme reminds him of their<br>
 obligations to the Republic.) C-3PO comments to R2D2, &quot;Sometimes<br>
 I just don&#146;t understand human behavior.&quot; Anakin and Padme leave<br>
 their ship with the droids and then proceed towards a large rock<br>
 formation (it&#146;s basically a building made out of rock.) They are trying<br>
 to find Obi-Wan. When they enter the building, they are surrounded<br>
 by droids. <br>
<br>
 Then Count Dooku, who is standing on a level above them, looks<br>
 down at them and says &quot;Give up. You are captured.&quot; (Not exact<br>
 quote) Dooku Force grabs Anakin&#146;s lightsaber right out of his hand<br>
 and then the droids take him and Padme to separate jail cells. In the<br>
 arena, Dooku, Jango, Poggle and a Neimodian are watching the Reek<br>
 devour slaves and they decide to feed Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme<br>
 to the Reek as well. The Reek is a dinosaur-like monster with three<br>
 horns. They bring out the three prisoners and are preparing to tie<br>
 them up to poles. First, they tie down Padme, but then . . . Mace<br>
 Windu enters the V.I.P. box where Dooku and friends are enjoying<br>
 the show. He taps Dooku on the shoulder who turns to see the Jedi<br>
 Master holding his lightsaber to Jango&#146;s throat. Then thousands of<br>
 Jedi Knights burst through the gates into the arena and into the<br>
 stands amongst the large crowd. The stadium lights up in a rainbow<br>
 of lightsabers and the action begins. <br>
<br>
 But as the Jedi free Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Reek, thousands<br>
 of advanced droids roll in as well and begin firing upon the Jedi. Mace<br>
 Windu dodges their fire and ends up jumping into the arena floor.<br>
 Windu is pursued by Jango Fett. The two men engage in battle for<br>
 quite some time, with the Reek charging both of them in a fury of<br>
 confusion and rage. In the end, Mace Windu decapitates Jango as<br>
 little Boba Fett watches on in horror. As Jango and Mace Windu are<br>
 fighting, Obi-Wan and Anakin manage to escape from the arena -<br>
 Padme does not. Because they don&#146;t have lightsabers, Anakin and<br>
 Obi-Wan pick up two sabers each from dead Jedi bodies. <br>
<br>
 They both engage in the attack and deflect droid blaster fire with two<br>
 lightsabers, one in each hand. Meanwhile, Count Dooku has slipped<br>
 out of the arena away from the action. Explosions begin in space as<br>
 Republic forces begin assaulting the Droid Control ships. Obi-Wan<br>
 and Anakin continue to attack the droids. They fight their way indoors<br>
 and out of sight from the arena. Anakin tells Obi-Wan he wants to go<br>
 back for Padme but Obi-Wan tells him to stay focused on the task at<br>
 hand. The line is something like &quot;You are my padawan and you must<br>
 do as I say.&quot; Anakin stays with him Also during the Jango/Windu<br>
 fight, Yoda arrives with an army of clonetroopers. It is Yoda and the<br>
 clones that finally save Padme from the arena and she then joins<br>
 them in the fight. She leads a squadron of clonetroopers. As the<br>
 action continues, Slave 1 takes to the sky and flees. It&#146;s passengers?<br>
<br>
<br>
 Only one - young Boba Fett. As the battle on the ground rages on,<br>
 the battle in the sky above Geonosis in underway as well. The battle<br>
 in the sky revolves around Ki-Adi Mundi leading six Jedi in an assault<br>
 on one of the two droid control ships. They fight their way through the<br>
 heavily guarded ship and into the control room where Ki-Adi Mundi<br>
 successfully throws the main switch that controls the droids. There are<br>
 four Nemoidians in the control center. When Ki-Adi throws the switch in<br>
 attempt to deactivate the droids on the ground, nothing happens. It<br>
 appears the Nemoidians have learned that lesson after the Battle of<br>
 Naboo. (The reason nothing happens to the droids is because they<br>
 are being controlled from the ground.) Among the Jedi who attack the<br>
 Droid Control ship is Plo Koon.<br>
<br>
 Somewhere in this sequence he is injured badly and almost dies. He<br>
 is shot by destroyer droids. Upon finding Dooku before he departs in<br>
 his solar sailor, the Jedi ignite their lightsabres in prepration to battle<br>
 the Sith Lord. Anakin charges into battle not heeding Obi-Wan&#146;s<br>
 warnings. Just as the young apprentice is about to strike the first<br>
 blow, Dooku calmly lifts his arm and the Jedi is lifted up and flung<br>
 across the room into the opposite wall. Obi-Wan sees this and fights<br>
 furiously against the droids so he can get to Anakin - he doesn&#146;t want<br>
 to leave his companion alone with a Sith Lord after he lost Qui-Gon<br>
 that way in Episode I. Anakin and Dooku are now alone, and Obi-Wan<br>
 fears he will lose Anakin just like he lost Qui-Gon. Anakin is in a state<br>
 of mental chaos.<br>
<br>
 His mother has just been slain in front of his very eyes, he can&#146;t<br>
 protect his love (Padme) from the battle outside, he has been<br>
 separated from his master, and he&#146;s now engaged in a battle against<br>
 one of the most powerful Force-wielders in the galaxy. Dooku sees<br>
 Anakin&#146;s mental instability and can sense his fear. Using this to his<br>
 advantage, he bullies Anakin for his own amusement. Dooku&#146;s intent<br>
 at this moment is not to turn Anakin to the dark side, rather to<br>
 amuse himself by messing with Anakin&#146;s head. Padme, at this time,<br>
 has been rescued by Mace Windu after he lops off Jango&#146;s head. She<br>
 joins the battle and leads a group of clonetroopers in the attack.<br>
 Anakin basically gets his butt whooped by Dooku. Anakin somehow<br>
 stops fighting with Dooku. Anakin gets knocked off a ledge and they<br>
 are separated and Dooku makes his way to Obi-Wan. Dooku and<br>
 Obi-Wan do battle. <br>
<br>
 Dooku is obviously a better fighter than Obi-Wan, using calculated<br>
 moves and expending little energy in the fight. It&#146;s not the constant<br>
 fighting like in Episode 1 - they talk quite a bit while fighting (like the<br>
 saber fights in the old trilogy.) Dooku speaks to Obi-Wan almost<br>
 hypnotically, telling him of the instability of the Republic and how it<br>
 will crumble. Addressing him as &quot;Master Kenobi,&quot; Dooku begs<br>
 Obi-Wan to just kill him, then easily deflects his saber when the<br>
 frustrated Jedi Knight attacks. At some point during this battle, Dooku<br>
 says to Obi-Wan &quot;I have spent the last ten years learning to use the<br>
 power of the dark side. <br>
<br>
 It gives me infinitely more power!&quot; Finally, Anakin returns to the<br>
 battle and it&#146;s now a 2 on 1 situation. The battle continues and, while<br>
 Obi-Wan appreciates the assistance, Dooku still overpowers both Jedi<br>
 at the same time. He begins to taunt both of them now, and seems<br>
 to be enjoying himself. Dooku pries into their deepest fears and<br>
 regrets. At some point in this battle, Anakin and Obi-Wan are fighting<br>
 Dooku and Obi-Wan falls down and out of the action. Anakin uses the<br>
 Force to call Obi-Wan&#146;s saber to his hand and he then starts wielding<br>
 two sabers at Dooku.<br>
<br>
 When Obi-Wan gets back into the fight, Anakin tosses his saber back<br>
 to him and the duel continues. He begins to tell Anakin he&#146;s fighting<br>
 a lost cause - he failed to protect his mother just as he failed to<br>
 protect Padme. Dooku tells Anakin that Padme has been killed in the<br>
 battle. Anakin snaps. Out of pure rage, he swings furiously at Dooku<br>
 who is a bit taken with the overwhelming power this young Jedi is<br>
 displaying. Dark side emotions run through Anakin and Dooku is<br>
 forced to defend himself with a little more caution. Obi-Wan finally<br>
 rejoins the battle. As the battle continues, Obi-Wan tries to control<br>
 Anakin. He tells him to concentrate on the battle and not to think of<br>
 Padme&#146;s death.<br>
<br>
 Upon hearing what he believes in confirmation from his master,<br>
 Anakin becomes so enraged he takes a swing at Obi-Wan. Count<br>
 Dooku continues to beat both Jedi at the same time. He force-throws<br>
 things at them and they are both getting injured (similarly to Luke vs.<br>
 Vader in ESB) Dooku then chops a large mechanical loading device<br>
 (like a claw) and it begins to fall on Anakin and Obi-Wan. This device,<br>
 however, does not land on the Jedi. As Dooku sees Yoda enter the<br>
 fight, he Force-throws objects at the two Jedi and knocks Anakin out.<br>
 Dooku and Yoda then fight. The battle ends as Yoda Force pushes<br>
 Dooku off a ledge and the badly beaten Sith Lord runs to his ship.<br>
 After Dooku flees, Obi-Wan rushes over to Yoda who is extremely<br>
 exhausted. <br>
<br>
 THE BATTLE, PART 3: IN THE HANGAR, there is still a big battle raging<br>
 on outside between the Jedi and the droids. The Jedi are losing, but<br>
 they are very ironically saved by a clone army. Where did these<br>
 clones come from? The Senate did not vote on the matter so they&#146;re<br>
 not Republic Clones, right? Well, it&#146;s an ironic answer - they came<br>
 from Kamino. The clones that save the Jedi are the secret clones that<br>
 an impostor named Sido-Dyas commissioned the Kaminoans to<br>
 create from Jango Fett&#146;s DNA. <br>
<br>
 After the Yoda/Dooku confrontation, Dooku gets to his ship and takes<br>
 off. Yoda is extremely exhausted from the battle and near collapses.<br>
 As Dooku&#146;s ship takes off, a beaten up Anakin and Obi-Wan rush<br>
 over to Yoda. At the same time, Padme, a clone captain, and about<br>
 ten more clones come rushing into the room. Padme runs up to<br>
 Anakin and embraces him. Anakin is so tired and beaten he can<br>
 barely stand. The clone captain marches up to Yoda and tells him the<br>
 resistance has come to an end. <br>
<br>
 Yoda is obviously not happy about the battle being won and there is a<br>
 great look of concern on his face. Back on Coruscant it is morning.<br>
 Count Dooku&#146;s ship lands in a secret platform in a deserted and<br>
 broken down part of the planet. He walks down the ramp and<br>
 approaches Darth Sidious. The two Sith Lords have a brief discussion<br>
 and are very pleased with the way things are going. <br>
<br>
 COUNT DOOKU I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun. <br>
<br>
 SIDIOUS Excellent. Everything is going as planned. <br>
<br>
 Back at the top of the temple the Jedi Council has convened. The<br>
 damage this war has done to the Jedi is catastrophic. Furthermore,<br>
 Mace Windu and Yoda are extremely concerned about the prophecy of<br>
 the Chosen One. Mace says to him &quot;The prophesy is true. The dark<br>
 side is growing.&quot; What is implied here is that the prophesy of the<br>
 chosen one states the dark side will consume the galaxy before<br>
 balance is restored. As it eventually does. Anakin and Padme have<br>
 returned to Naboo to get married in secret. <br>
<br>
 They return to the Lake Retreat they were at before leaving for<br>
 Tatooine. They have a very small wedding, witnessed only by C-3PO,<br>
 R2D2 and a holy man. Back on Coruscant, the Republic decides to<br>
 take action immediately. Clone armies are being produced in masses<br>
 and sent to all corner&#146;s of the galaxy. The Clone Wars are about to<br>
 begin. The last line scenes of the film are in the Jedi Temple.<br>
 Obi-Wan and the four remaining council members (Yoda, Mace<br>
 Windu, Ki-Adi Mundi, and Plo Koon) are discussing the battle. Yoda<br>
 has the last line in the movie, and he says it to Obi-Wan: YODA<br>
 Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory. A defeat it was, Master Obi-Wan.<br>
 Begun, the Clone War has!<br>
