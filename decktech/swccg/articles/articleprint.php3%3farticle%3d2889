This article is intended for beginner players only. If you are a expert player, don&#146;t give it a bad rating just because it isn&#146;t at your level. Beginner players are the ones that will hold the SWCCG community up in the future, if we don&#146;t show them the excitement of playing, then there is no future.<br>

<br>
<br>
This article will give the beginner player 10 tips on how to start out in the SWCGG community. It will show the beginner how to start out, what he should do when starting, and how to progress onto tournaments.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIP #1: Start out with the starters.<br>
<br>
Ok, you just got into the SWCCG universe, and your dying to play, right? Just one problem, what do you buy first? Decipher has made many expansion sets, sealed decks, 2-player sets, and starter decks. Decipher right now has 3 starter decks on the market...<br>
<br>
1. Premiere Starter Deck<br>
2. Special Edition Starter Deck<br>
3. Death Star II Starter Deck<br>
<br>
Also, Decipher has made two 2-player sets, which have two 60 card decks, a rulebook, and a cardlist...<br>
<br>
1. Premiere 2-Player Set<br>
2. Empire Strikes Back 2-Player Set<br>
<br>
These starter decks and sets should be the first things to get on your list when you just start out in SWCCG. The starter decks are already pre-made with solid decks, but to use for starters. Starter decks are good for the beginner player to show him the many different cards in the SWCCG universe. The Special Edition Starter Deck includes a rulebook and a glossary, so I would advise to get those first. If you have a brother or sister, or a friend who also wants to try out SWCCG, try to get your hands on a 2-Player set.<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s the difference in the starter decks and sets...<br>
<br>
Premiere Starter Deck (Tatooine, Death Star, etc.)<br>
Special Edition Starter Deck (Aliens, fixed sites)<br>
Death Star II Starter Deck (Starships, Vehicles, Endor &amp; Death Star II)<br>
<br>
Try to get the Premiere Starter Decks or Special Edition Starter Decks first, and observe the cards, and play with a sibling or a friend with them. Get to know the cards well, and how to use them. When you know the cards in those decks pretty well, buy two Death Star II Starter Decks, and play those. Death Star II Starter Decks are a little more complex with cards, dealing with interrupts, starships, effects, and vehicles. Play those for a while, and you should have the basis emphasis for playing SWCCG.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIP #2: Buying expansion packs.<br>
<br>
Ok, so you&#146;ve played the starter decks 100s of times, and you want to get into buying expansion packs now, and learn how to make your own decks, right? Well, when you go up to the stand, and you see 12 different packs of SWCCG cards, in boxes, waiting to be bought. So you&#146;ve got the money to buy some cards, just one question, what cards do you get? Decipher has made 12 sets of cards that make what is called the SWCCG universe...<br>
<br>
1. Premiere (Black Package)<br>
2. A New Hope (Purple Package)<br>
3. Hoth (White Package)<br>
4. Dagobah (Dull Green Package)<br>
5. Cloud City (Dark Red Package)<br>
6. Jabba&#146;s Palace (Gold Package)<br>
7. Endor (Forest Green Package)<br>
8. Death Star II (Ruby Red Package)<br>
9. Reflections (Multi-Color Package)<br>
10. Reflections II (Multi-Color Package)<br>
11. Tatooine (Multi-color Package) (Episode I)<br>
12. Courascant (Multi-Color Package) (Episode I)<br>
<br>
Also, you see other SWCCG stuff next to it...<br>
<br>
1. Tournament Sealed Deck (Square Box)<br>
2. 2nd Anthology (Gold Rectangular Box)<br>
3. 3rd Anthology (Black Rectangular Box)<br>
4. Jabba&#146;s Palace Sealed Deck (square Box)<br>
<br>
So, your stunned to see all the different questions, you just don&#146;t know what to buy. Well you could start buying the first set Premiere (Black Package) but, since it was made in 1995, the cards in there are low power, and won&#146;t help you to start out in SWCCG. For starters, I would buy either Jabba&#146;s Palace (Gold Package), Endor (Forest Green Package), Tatooine (Multi-Color Package), or Courascant (Multi-Color Package). Jabba&#146;s Palace is good due to the numerous characters in the set, your definite that you&#146;ll pull a character in every package. Endor is good due to good charcaters, good interrupts, it&#146;s just a good set. <br>
<br>
Tatooine and Courascant are both Episode I cards, meaning there cards from Episode I the movie. They are quite good actually, for the starter player or expert player. It&#146;s up to you what to buy, but those four sets are best for starters. Reflections I &amp; II are special packages of cards. They have cards from all the sets along with a foil rare in each package. If you have a high encome, and can afford $5 a pack, buy those.<br>
<br>
The other SWCCG stuff is etc. stuff. The Tournament Sealed Deck (Square Box) is a box which can hold cards, and has 4 packs of Premiere, a pack of A New Hope, and 20 Premium cards for playing what they call a Tournament Sealed Deck. Those are good to buy, so then you have something to hold your decks in. The Jabba&#146;s Palace Sealed Deck is just the same just that you get instead 6 packs of Jabba&#146;s Palace, and 20 other Premium cards. The 2nd &amp; 3rd Anthologies are rectangular boxes that like sealed decks, have packs inside of them. Each one has starter decks, packs of cards, and some premium cards in them. They are good for any player, new or old. So, just buy the packs you want, and start tying to make your own decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIPS #3: Making Decks<br>
<br>
Ok, your bought packs of cards, you&#146;ve unsorted your starter decks, and your ready to make your own decks, right? Deck-making isn&#146;t that hard, but takes soem practice to make some good decks. You have 12 types of cards at your disposal...<br>
<br>
1. Characters (Speckeled White or Black cards)<br>
2. Vehicles (Blue cards)<br>
3. Starships (Blue Cards)<br>
4. Weapons (Green Cards)<br>
5. Devices (Green Cards)<br>
6. Interrupts (Red Cards)<br>
7. Effects (Red Cards)<br>
8. Locations (Horizontal Cards)<br>
9. Systems (Space Cards)<br>
10. Jedi Tests (Speckled Green Cards)<br>
11. Epic Events (Purple Cards)<br>
12. Objectives (2-Sided Purple Cards)<br>
<br>
If you just bought your first packages of cards, you probably dont&#146; have all those types of cards, but don&#146;t worry, not all decks need them all. Ok so you need Characters, Vehicles, and Starships to deploy. Weapons and devices to deploy on them. Interrupts and Effects to alter the game. Locations and Systems to deploy the stuff to. So what are the other three cards? Jedi Tests are special cards in which you can train a character to become a Jedi. Only two sets have these cards, five are in the Dagobah set, and one in the Death Star II set. They are in numerical order, and range from Jedi Test #1 to Jedi Test #6. Epiv Events are special cards, in which major events in the movies, like the blowing up of the Death Star, attack on Hoth, the epic duel of Luke and Vader, Death Star II operational, and the Boonta Eve Podrace. All these epic events are major parts in the movies, and the game as well. Objectives, are very special cards. They are 2-sided purple cards which you can only have one per deck, because you start out with it. Objectives are cards in which you have an objective to accomplish, and once you do, you get your rewards. There are tons of objectives, ranging from blowing up the Death Star, to converting Vader to the light side, to blowing up Alderaan, to battling it out in the Senate. The possibilites are endless. <br>
<br>
Your decks should be well balanced, make sure when your pick locations pick from 6-10 locations or systems and make sure you get force from them, and hardly any for the opponent, because you dont want to give your opponent force. Also, keep your Interrupts/Effects balanced with your number of Characters/Vehicles/Starships, just so you don&#146;t over-deploy or too many interrupts. Also keep in mind the destiny numbers of the cards your putting in your deck, you should always want high destiny whether it&#146;s for retrieving force with On The Edge, or Off The Edge, or battle or weapon destiny. Also make sure that your decks only have 60 cards in them. With some practice, you&#146;ll be making good decks in no time.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIP #4: Going to a tournament.<br>
<br>
So, you&#146;ve made your decks, played them hard, and your ready to go to a tournament. Here&#146;s how basic tournaments are held and played. Usually they are held at hobby or game stores, usually on Saturdays, near noon. when you get there, you must pay a fee, usually it&#146;s $5 or buy something $5-$10 in the store to get in. They give you a piece of paper called a Command Card. This card is what you use to record your playing, the force you have left determines your differential, and if you win you get victory points. you fill out your name, info, etc. on it. Give it back to the TD, and soon they&#146;ll announce the pairings, the people each person will face against. When you play at a tournament, it&#146;ll be alot different because you don&#146;t know the other person&#146;s deck, so there will be a suprise. If you win, congratulations, you just got 2 victory points, and whatever differential you got. If you lost, it&#146;s ok, everyone wins and loses. You&#146;ll be playing about 4-6 games, each one about 60 minutes. There are 5 types of tournaments...<br>
<br>
1. Junior Constructed (Ages 5-14)<br>
2. Constructed (Any age)<br>
3. Sealed (Using Sealed boxes)<br>
4. Closed (Certain cards allowed)<br>
5. Sealed Closed (Certain cards in certain boxes)<br>
<br>
When going to a tournament, be prepared to face some tough decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
TIP #5: Preparing for a tournament.<br>
<br>
So, it&#146;s the day before the tournament, and you can&#146;t wait to play with your new decks you made. The day before the tournament is just as important as the day of the tournament. The day before the tournament, get lots of rest, eat nutritional stuff, make sure you feel ok to play tomorrow, etc. Make sure you get enough sleep for the tournament, get a good breakfast, and make sure your ready for a SWCCG-packed day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that sums it up for the 5 tips for the beginning player. I&#146;ll be making more articles soon, as time goes by.<br>
