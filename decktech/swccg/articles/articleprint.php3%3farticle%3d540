<br>
Revolution  Destiny 3 Effect. Use 3 force to deploy on any location. Rotate the location that icons and game texts switch direction. ( If Expand the Empire present , it also switches.) If Revolution later cancelled , location rotates back again.<br>
<br>
Revolution.the very sound of the word evokes power and fear.<br>
<br>
History--  It was pretty much THE dominant decktype for SWCCG for a very long time. It ruled in the days of Premiere with Mains and Sabers at the Revolutioned Obis Hut for a 5 drain. It was the main factor in the early force choke decks during ANH and was just nasty combined with Undercover Spies and protection from them. Revolution was basically the only decktype other then Echo Base Operations that people used during the era of Hoth. BOOM ! Dagobah comes out and all of a sudden it is Dagobah Drainand what does Dagobah Drain use to do damage ( besides Anger Fear Aggression )Revolution on Yodas Hut ! Then came Cloud City we got Captain Han to knock the opponent around with an extra destiny after we choked them down to small amounts of force with Revolution. Actually I dont remember Cloud City making much of a difference in my decks; anyway moving on. Jabbas Palace comes out and we have Throne Room start with and we have some characters ( usually Bomarr Monks ) get to Jabbas Palace ASAP , try to Alter Expand the Empire or Bad Feeling Have I , and then Revo their little 1/0 Jabbas Palace Sites to get activation advantage on them. Here comes Special Edition. Pre-Errata  Revolution was used with Clackdor 7 Pre-Errata Hidden Base to choke the opponent to the strongest extent to date ( I have horror stories as Im sure you do toolets just say those 4 Evaders I put in the deck seemed to be the card I payed to draw 1). Special Edition  after all the erratas Revolution was used in the No Shelter designs which probably wasnt the most popular decktype during  SE but was one of the stronger ones ( in good hands of course ).	Endor comes out and Battle Plan makes choke nastier so Revolution hangs around here and there. Then these Enhanced Cloud City and Enhanced Jabbas Palace come out and Revolution isnt as strong as it was. But is it still worth it ?<br>
<br>
Revolution Counters :<br>
Evader	This cancels all Revos in play and you lose a force for each of them.<br>
Imperial Justice  This cancels Revo on whatever location this effect is deployed on.<br>
Comeback Here You Big Coward  Usually cancels your force drains and retrieval at 1/0 or 2/0 locationsnot much of a hinder .<br>
Crush the Rebelliongrabs Evader ; makes it Immune to Sense and they can grab it once per turn.<br>
<br>
Revolution Counter-Counters :<br>
Sense  cancels Evader if Crush isnt on table.<br>
Alter  cancels Imperial Justice and can cancel CBHYBCoward after you knock them off battlegrounds.<br>
Visored Vision	make them lose their copies of Evader after they use thempretty flexible too.<br>
Grappler  grapples Evader after they use it.<br>
<br>
I will not list Revolution Counter-Counter-Counters or Revolution Counter-Counter-Counter-Counters because you pretty much get the idea.<br>
<br>
GETTING TO THE FREAKING POINT : )<br>
<br>
Is Revolution still worth it ?<br>
<br>
It use to be that in any kinda deck you could throw Revolution in and it would be awesome because Revolving a drain +1 site youve saved like 8 force for the rest of the game and that could be in something random like a Hidden Base or whatever deck. BUT from what Ive observed in the last year or so the game seems to go more and more towards battling and ability cards rather then Effects and Interrupts. The only decks that Revolution could hurt is HDADTJ , ISB , and Ralltiir Ops. I havent seen a HDADTJ that doesnt use Crush the Rebellion since its release. I havent seen ISB in awhile but the Docking Bay versions wont really get hurt by Revolution. Ralltiir Ops can get hurt but thats about it for just throwing the card in. So if you wanna make Revolution worthwhile that means your gonna have to start playing Grapplers or Visored Visions to get the full unhindered effect all of the time. That is the only way I see Revolution as being worth it. Death Star , Tatooine : Jabbas Palace , Jabbas Palace : Audience Chamber , and all the 2/2 locations for the Dark Side arent hurt by Revolution so Big Blue and Scum and Villiany wont be hurt as much. The ECC and EJP Objectives both force the lightside to get stuff to Cloud City or Jabbas Palace and fast so they dont run over you with the Objectives text. This means ability cards.<br>
<br>
So as the bottom line : I dont think Revolution is worth it right now. Throw in some extra forfeit foddermore Elis protectionor another starship. Revolution isnt worth savingyet ; but I do think it will rear its head once more.<br>
