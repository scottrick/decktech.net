<br>
   Everyone says that as soon as JPSD hits the shelfs and the tourney scene, that ROps is as good as dead. Well, I&#146;d have to say that is true, to some extent, but ROps will live on.<br>
First, some people are dedicated to ROps, and will play it no matter what, like morons.<br>
<br>
Second, some people can make good ROps decks, and will be able to succeed with the &quot;dead&quot; ROps deck.<br>
<br>
Third, and this is my biggest point, it will go on in a circle forever. Heres how the circle goes: the ROps players stop playing ROps initally because of the threat of Ounee Ta, but once ROps is just about completely gone, that card slot taken by Ounee Ta will be better given to something else. I might, it is good against two things, ROps, and None Shall Pass, and non shall pass will probably only be used in court and the new JPSD decks, and it wont be in 100% of those decks, either. So, as the need for Ounee Ta disappears, the card will be removed from decks, and ROps players will know it. ROps will eventually seep back into the tourney scene, until it is expected enough that Ounee Ta is used again, and this could go on in an infinite circle unless ROps gets another, more lethal bullet. This same thing has been true with Huntdown, which died, and will make a triumphant (and kinda already has) return, with JPSD, and ISB. I mean, ISB won the world championships today. Everyone thought blount was the death of ISB, but everyone now knows that blount is just a minor bother, who can be easily exterminated. And this all gets back to the point that ROps will never truely be slayed by Ounee Ta, just parts of it, and only at certain time, or until a better deck rolls along.<br>
<br>
ok, now you were probably all like &quot;that sucked&quot; but, i tried, honestly, so give me the credit for that. PLEASE dont give it those crappy one word reviews, critique it so i know what to change for the future. one word reviews will just make it so i dont change, and therefore you read the same crap again and again, so take the 4 seconds to type out a sentence, ok? thanks a million<br>
