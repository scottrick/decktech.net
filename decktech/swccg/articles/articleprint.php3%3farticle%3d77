<br>
     This is the third article in my series about efficiency in deck design. Established is that we must choose cards consistent with either damaging or disrupting our opponent, and that our cards should be useful in as many of our strategies as possible. The second conept, the case that our strategies should be multiply useful, is supported by this articles concept, draw percentages. We will examine what they are, and why they are important in considering deck design, and furthermore, why they are one of the main differences between focused and unfocusd strategies, and why they tend to separate the great decks from the pretty good ones.<br>

The Fifth Principal: Draw Percentages and their effect on efficiency<br>
<br>
     To begin any discussion on percentages, we must first examine exacltly what i mean by the term draw percentage, and then examine why this is relavant to our discussion on efficiency. There are many aspects of draw percentages, but at its heart, draw percentages (and the numbers that can be used to represent them, which will be explained later) are essentially the percentage chance (or ratio if you will) that any given card will be drawn into your hand at different points during the game, and that the card that is drawn will be useful in that given situation. This is to say that if you have to have an operative in play in order to win games with your Ops deck, you better include enough copies of the card so that you can draw one in a timely fashion, and you better not include too many operatives, lest they become totally useless when drawn. At first glance, this seems relatively simple.. include 9 or 10 operative cards in your Ops deck, along with a few Nar Shaddaa Wind chimes, and youll draw them in a timely fashion, and the chimes are even multiply useful in drawin up whatever other non-unique aliens you have in your deck right? Well, it gets more complicated when you consider it from a different perspective. Take the same operatives deck. It has trouble beating decks (or at least needs to be able to counter decks) that use the cards bright center to the universe, and ISB agents. It also needs to be able to counter Choke vader, and beatdown. The problem comes in when you consider that not all of your matchups will be against those decks, and the cards used in stopping those strategies (say, for instance, tyderium and a tantive IV, and maybe a few speeders, or rebel barriers) are relatively useless in situations not involvig playing against those decks. In an optimal situation, the counters to the opposing deck matchups would be useful in the overall strategy of the deck somehow, however, this is not often the case. So, in the given example, we have several choices to make; we decide how often we expect to face the decks for which we have provided counters for (and choose the number of counters accoridingly) and we must decide that given a matchup between our deck and the given deck, how many counters would be necessary for a favorable outcome (how many counters would we need to beat the deck were including counters for). We must balance those factors all while juggling the possibility that we may be diluting our overall deck concept at the same time. As soon as we begin to include more and more counters in our decks (ie, landing claws against DS space, yoxgit, etc.) the juggling act gets tougher. So, we all deal with aspects of draw percentages, in that we know we must draw certain cards at certain points during certain games, and we attempt to 'rig' our decks by including multiples of those cards in our decks condusive to drawing them at that time.<br>
     A simple way of going about figuring out simple deck percentages is the formula C/60-(Lc+Sc+Hc) where C is the number of the said card still present in your deck (knowing exactly how many of each card you play with is in your deck is VERY important), Lc, is the number of, lost cards, Sc is the number of cards in play, and Hc is the size of your hand. So we have a method for calculating probability using the ratio of how many of the given cards are in the deck over the number of cards that we expect to be in our decks at a given point during a matchup (which is a fairly rough estimate when building decks, but one that can be made with reasonable accuracy). We should also at this step include any cards that can be used to search for the desired card in your deck (this means that having 3 signals in your deck after your SI is like having 4 of every effect in your deck. It really is.). The main impact of this ratio is not that we can suddeny devinely influence our card draws, but merely that we now have a method for calculating the probablility that any given card that we need will be in our force pile at any given time (note that cards that search your deck help this somewhat because they allow you to see when there is, in fact a card present in your force pile). This can be applied in several different ways. First off, ill use a simple example: the mains and toys deck. Mains and Toys needs a lot of generation to play its high cost characters and effects, and thus it needs to draw locations at early points in the game to be effective. So lets examine several possibilities for a moment. Lets assume we have 4 locations other than our start (Obi's hut) in our decks, and our opponents locations are giving us no force per turn (hes a jerk). We Draw our 8 cards at the start of the game (we started Wise Advice with a signal) and none of them are locations. We have our 3 activated and draw up. None of them are locations, and this is no surprise. WHY? We couldve predicted this type of slow start by using our formula. Plugging a few numbers in we get 4/60-(1+2+8), giving us 4/49, which means that roughly one card out of 12 we draw will be a location. We draw our first card, and it isnt a location. Our probablility drops to 4/48 (cards in hand increased), and thus the probability that the next card we will have in hand will be the card we want is literally 1 in 12, adn the process continues. This may seem simple, but the mathematics of it are important because they lay down in mathematics incontrovertable proof that the number of cards of a given type you put in your deck affects your chances of drawing them at any given time. And this is to say that you should include more of the cards you need so you draw them at the times you need them. It is also intuitive from this point that you should include less of the cards you do not need so as to be able to include more of the cards you do need (or that the number of cards of each type in your deck should be consistent with the chance that they will be useful at any given moment or are necessary for the completion of your deck objectives (disruption and damage, see V.1 and V.2 for more on that)).<br>
     A note needs to be added here further explaining the effect of search cards on draw percentages. The Function of search cards relative to draw percentages is that they tend to increase the chance of several cards at one time of being drawn, so that the search card itself, becomes useful at many more given times, and thus allows the inclusion of less of the searched-for cards, concurrent with the suggestion i made earlier about not including cards youre not going to use so you can include more of the cards you ARE going to. That is the fundamental relation of draw percentages to efficiency. Using the correct number of each type of card so that they may be obtained when necessary, but are not obtained, or are unlikely to be obtained when unnesary. Other functions of search cards include their usually high destiny and their ability to allow you to look throgh your reserve, as an anit numbers strategy as well, thus providing overlapping substrategies inherent in their design, making them incredibly efficient.<br>
     A further concept in the application of draw percentages is the import of overlapping substrategies is clearly seen in the effectiveness of the cards used. This is to say that if your 'counter strategy' somehow works in harmony with your deck strategy, more of the counter strategy may be used without diluting the deck design, thus maintaining efficiency.<br>
     Another concpet in efficiency in relation to draw percentages is the 'fat' start. A 'fat' start is when you begin play with a whole bunch of cards on the table (an operative objective with a dont tread on me would be an example, as would a hunt down with epic duel and an SI, or a DS endor objective and dont tread on me,etc.). The effect the 'fat' start has on your draw percentages is that it effectively reduces the number of cards in your deck when you start the game, thus allowing you to include fewer cards and have a greater chance of drawing them. Lets take the hunt down example. We start 7 cards fro the hunt down objective, and we need those battlegrounds, so we included 4 in the deck. The equation goes something like this then: 4/60-(1+6+8) or 4/45.. we activate 4, which makes our final chances about 1 in 10 instead of 1 in 12 of drawing that location. However, the math changes a little when you dig a little deeper. Our First candidate (the Obi Hut example) drew 3 cards at a probability of about 1 in 12. Using some algebra, that means that his total probability of any of the given cards being what he wanted was 3 in 12, or about 1/3. Our hunt down friend however, drew 4 cards at a probability of about 1 in 10, thus making his total probablility about 4 in 10 or 40%. This only increases in the next few turns due to the increased activation of the hunt down start. This means that in effect, Hunt Down decks need to include less locations than decks starting Obiwans Hut in order to draw them effectively. That is the second effect of draw percentages in efficiency. Efficient use of cards. It is, however, open to debate and playstyle exactly how many of specific types of cards should be included in deck designs for purposes of strategy and it often involves determining how many of specific sites you will want to use over the course of an entire game and adjusting your draw percentages assuming deployment costs and such. This is to say that if you want 3 locations in hand by your 3rd turn, you can figure out whether or not the chances of that actually happening are pretty good using numbers. Also, you must factor in things like whether or not the cards you play may be cancelled, or modified so that another copy may be necessary to be effective. This also can be determined using the techniques that ive shown.<br>
     Uncancellable cards are important in draw percentages because you only need deploy one over the course of the game, and thus drawing muplitple copies becomes unimportant due to the fact that the deployment of the original often makes the drawing of the multiples quite useless. This is to say that if you plan on playing with imperial decree, you need only deploy one over the course of the game, and any further deployments of that card are fairly inneffective at furthering the goals accomplished with the deployment of that card. Thus, uncncellable cards are more efficient in terms of draw percentage because they warrant less inclusion in numbers (due to that one accomplishes the same goals as many) and they free up deckspace that would have been used to defend that card (with SAC or what have you) for other substrata or multiples to increase draw percentages. A further effect many global uncancellables have is their ability to overlap with other strategies. For instance, the imperial decree overlaps with the defense against revo and your ability to slow your opponents  force drains. Also, secret plans allows you to recycle a high destiny, defend against manipulation, and slow your opponents force retreival, thus making them multiply useful (overlapping strategies) while requiring a low number of them present to have the desired effect (draw percentages). Add a few signals, and it gets even better.<br>
     I hope that this article has shed some light on the subject of draw percentages and ratios, and as there was too much to explain in only one article, i will further discuss this topic again next week, and include a formula for calculating how efficient the use of cards in a given deck might be. Im going to have to cut these back to one per week because it seems that midterms are already here, and due to time constraints i just wont be able to spend as much time writing on here as id like. Anyhow, i hope this was as informative as i hoped it would be, and as ive continued to get a lot of positive feedback about these articles (check out my other 2 articles on efficiency before you read this one)  ill continue to write them for as long as people read them.<br>
