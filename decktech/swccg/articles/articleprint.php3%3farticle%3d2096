<br>
Watch Your Step:<br>
<br>
What gametext last for &quot;the remainder of the game&quot;?<br>
<br>
* Opponent Activates no force at the Cantina<br>
* Your cards with ability are deploy +6 except...<br>
* Opponent&#146;s Gametext on Kessel is cancelled<br>
<br>
Agents of the Black Sun/Vengeance Of The Dark Prince:<br>
<br>
Can you define Black Sun Agents?<br>
<br>
(a) all cards with &#146;Black Sun agent&#146; in lore. (e.g. Guri)<br>
(b) all aliens with &#146;Black Sun&#146; in lore. (e.g. Makurth)<br>
(c) all information brokers (e.g. Labria)<br>
(d) all bounty hunters<br>
(e) only Dark Side cards are Black Sun Agents<br>
<br>
What gametext last for &quot;the remainder of the game&quot;?<br>
<br>
* Your...are black sun agenets<br>
* You may not deploy Cards with ability other than Emporer and Black Sun Agents<br>
* During your control phase each of your Bounty Hunters may move to a bounty<br>
* Scanning Crew may not be played<br>
<br>
Obi&amp;#8217;s Journal:<br>
<br>
Can you cancel the whole drain still?<br>
<br>
If you cancel the drain (i.e. control, den of thieves,&amp;#8230;) the bonus has no effect.<br>
<br>
Sense/Alter Combination Cards:<br>
<br>
If the flip side of Watch Your Step is up, sense and alter can not be played. Does this keep my opponent from playing the combo card for its other function?<br>
<br>
Yes &amp;#8211; by the combo rules. This card is considered to be sense or alter so it can&amp;#8217;t be played.<br>
<br>
Do I have to lose force for Do or Do Not or There is No Try for the &quot;non-alter&quot; draw that I make with the second function?<br>
<br>
Yes &amp;#8211; there is no alter part of the card (even though you know the difference the card doesn&amp;#8217;t). Therefore, anything that affects sense/alter affects all parts of the card completely (i.e. There is not try, control, Sense or Alter&amp;#8230;)<br>
<br>
Artoo &amp; Threepio<br>
<br>
Can I target them with &quot;Artoo, I have a bad about this&quot;? Or does this violate the rule that state a card cannot be &quot;with&quot; itself?<br>
<br>
Yes - That rule only refers to card characteristics not personna (i.e. an alien and rebel are not in battle together with ANH Chewbacca). Since this card has both personnas of R2 and 3PO &amp;#8211; this is a valid target.<br>
<br>
This same ruling applies to Harvest with Owen and Beru &amp;#8211; although Harvest is worded slightly different.<br>
<br>
If Artoo &amp; Threepio initiate a battle against another droid that normally cannot be battled (and there is no other presence at the site), what happens if Artoo &amp; Threepio have their gametext cancelled?<br>
<br>
The battle is over &amp;#8211; since there is no longer any &quot;presence for the purpose of battling&quot; remaining for both sides.<br>
<br>
Does this card deploy -2 or -4 with profit?<br>
<br>
The current ruling from Juz is that the card only deploys -2.  The rational has not been laid out exactly - but is explained that profit does not give a -2 to EACH artoo and threepio.  The ruling is still bulky to understand why - but easy to implement.<br>
<br>
Mercenary Armor<br>
<br>
Can I use mercenary Armor and the BlasTech E-11B Blaster Rifle to shot repeatedly for free?<br>
<br>
No &amp;#8211; the blasted droid (CRD &amp;#8211; Weapons Firing out of Battle) rule was established to prevent any card that allowed for a free shot to only apply to the first shot from a weapon that was allowed to fire repeatedly. That rule applies here.<br>
<br>
Snoova<br>
<br>
Can I deploy as many Vibro-Axes on Snoova as I want during the same turn?<br>
<br>
No &amp;#8211; His text specifies during the deploy phase &amp;#8211; and as such it limited to once (per the &quot;One&quot; rule in the Glossary). Likewise, he can transfer a weapon to another applicable character by paying the deploy cost for the new character (i.e. it won&amp;#8217;t be free unless it would be free on the new character to start with).<br>
<br>
What happens when he uses Sniper with a Vibro-ax?<br>
<br>
Snoova may just sniper to capture. The vibro ax does exclude people from battle only, but since Snoova&#146;s gametxt lets him use the vibro ax as a capturing weapon (in essence), it&#146;s allowed to provide a valid capture during the control phase, if sniper is played.<br>
<br>
Jabba&#146;s Prize<br>
<br>
Can I Elis Helrot with Jabba&#146;s Prize since its my card?<br>
<br>
No &amp;#8211; Elis does not target captives.  And the captive is not allowed to move with the escort with that special movement (See Captives - Escorting) in the CRD. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
