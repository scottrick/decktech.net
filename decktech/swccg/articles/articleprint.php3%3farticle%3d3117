As the Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game (LOTR) player community grows, the strategies for winning tournaments will shift from luck and &#8220;who has the best cards&#8221; to solid deck design.  One of the beautiful things about this game is that one can build an effective deck with mostly common and uncommon cards.  Sure, it&#8217;s nice to pack four Witch Kings in a deck, but it is not necessary to win.  One of the biggest advantages to have in LOTR is to possess a deck in which the Fellowship, Shadow, and Site cards all further a common goal.  Selecting a goal, selecting cards, and eliminating cards that do not further the goal are the steps one can follow in order to accomplish this task.<br>
<br>
Selecting a Goal<br>
<br>
	The first thing to do when designing a deck is to select the deck&#8217;s purpose.  It could be a deck that relies on the Shadow side to defeat the opponent, relies on the Fellowship side to out race the opponent, or a mixture of both.  Regardless, the goal needs to be something that both sides can help achieve.  It is much easier to pick a strategy to work from than it is to pick a culture or a few power cards (read Witch King, Cave Troll, and Lurtz) to build on. The easiest thing to do is to read through the spoiler list a get an idea of what options are available.  The important thing to remember here is to be specific.  It is very difficult to get multiple strategies to work together because it become very hard to get the cards need into hand.  For example, selecting a archery/corruption strategy may be two broad.  One other thing to consider is access to cards.  It may not be possible to pursue certain strategies if the cards it will require are not available.  After looking at the list, it appears there are a lot of cards that cause the opponent to discard, so this article will use that strategy as an example. <br>
<br>
Selecting Cards<br>
<br>
	Once the goal has been selected, it is time to select the cards that will go into the deck.  Even though they need to work together, it is easier to select all of the Fellowship cards at once and then all of the Shadow cards (or vice versa.)  Just start going down the spoiler list and pick out anything that will even remotely help the goal.  This is much like brainstorming in a problem-solving group.  Write down anything that comes to mind.  There will even be some cards that are selected even though they have nothing to do with the selected goal.  In the discard example, it becomes apparent that a lot of the Shadow cards are Urak-hai so it won&#8217;t hurt to add Lurtz in at this point even though he does nothing to make the opponent discard. Consequently, it does not hurt to add in weapons for the main characters like A Ranger&#8217;s Sword for Aragorn or Gimli&#8217;s Battle Axe.  In addition, it is a good idea to add in any defensive cards to guard against some of the more popular strategies.  After selecting cards, the discard strategy appears that it is made up mostly of Urak-hai/Sauron for the Shadow side and Dwarf/Elf for the Fellowship side.  As soon as all of the cards have been selected for the two sides, it is time to move on to the third phase.  <br>
<br>
Eliminating Cards That Do Not Support the Goal<br>
	<br>
Narrowing the deck size down is probably the most difficult part of deck construction because there are a lot of things to consider.   Deck size, number of available cards, and ability to get a needed card into hand are important.    It helps at this point to organize the cards into culture because each culture will usually need a certain amount of same-culture cards to support it.  The first thing to do is look at the number of cultures involved.  Three is probably too many.  In the discard example, there are cards from the Sauron, Urak-hai, and Ringwraith cultures.  However, there are very few Ringwraith cards on the list so it is a good idea to eliminate all cards from that culture for this deck.  Pick one side and start to go down the cards selected in earlier. Start eliminating cards that do not further the goal.  The idea is that in a 60-card deck there will be 8-12 different cards.  So if two cultures are involved, there will be between four and six cards for each culture.  The exception here is with companions who will be of different cultures, but may not need support cards from their cultures.    Obviously, some cards will be in the deck to do things other than further your goal.  Since Lurtz is always going to create problems for an opponent and there are only so many minions that make the opponent discard, it only does good things to leave him in the deck.  Since the fellowship side is mostly Elves and Dwarves, it may be wise to eliminate the Ranger&#8217;s Sword for Aragorn. It is very hard to not play a powerful card, but keep asking the question &#8220;Does it help the chosen goal?&#8221;  If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, it is a candidate for elimination before a card that would give a &#8220;yes&#8221; answer. The point is that when it is all said and done, a vast majority (85-90%) of the cards on both sides of the deck should further the decks chosen goal.  <br>
<br>
The Site Cards<br>
 <br>
The last thing to do is to pick the site cards for the deck.  These are easier to pick once the Fellowship and Shadow cards have been selected.  The general idea is to pick sites that will benefit your overall strategy or at the least, help either you Fellowship or Shadow side.  At best, the site will aid both sides.  In the discard deck, there is a site 2 card that forces the opponent to discard for each minion played at that site.  While it does not directly aid the Fellowship (it will suffer the discard effect to,) it does further the decks overall goal of forcing the opponent o discard. However, in some situations, the best that can be hoped for is to pick a site that will not hurt the deck.  For the most part, the early sites benefit the Fellowship side while the later sites benefit the Shadow side.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
	In summary, it is important to remember that making a deck with synergy between the two side will lead to a much more effective deck.  Before design being, select a goal that the deck will achieve.  Next, use a brainstorming process of selecting cards that will work well in that deck.  Finally, narrow the number of cards down to an efficient amount for the strategy selected.  In doing so, the deck created will be much more efficient and effective than one that has two sides that do not relate to each other.<br>
