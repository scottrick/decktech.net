It's pretty vicious when people get it to work on one another, and usually(not always)will determine the outcome of the game. This article is to provide players with a basis to catch people cheating and to understand why they do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, why cheat?<br>
<br>
<br>
I certainly can distinguish why people cheat to win a few games. A few reasons may be a personal vendetta or a 'friendly' rivalry. It may be because the player is doing alot worse than he's supposed to be, and he wants to soften the blow to his diffrential. Maybe it's a key battle to determine the game, one you need to win. Another reason, and probaly the most common, is your lack of confidence against some bigger named players, such as Ray Bordier, Clint Hays, and Paul Feldman, and your desperate need to beat them. In all, though, I believe the reason people cheat is due to thier lack of confidence in themselves and thier decks, maybe one, maybe both.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Method of Crime<br>
<br>
<br>
There is more than one way to cheat in the world of SWCCG. Here are a few popular ways to go about it:<br>
<br>
Overactivating: Often times people will activate more than theyre supposed to on accident, so dont call someone a cheater if its a simple miscalculation. If the person is cheating, he will usually activate alot more than he supposed to, such as 5-8 more force, allowing him to deploy the cards or initiate the action needed to win the game.<br>
<br>
Hand-Force Pile: Often times when players feel the urge to add a few more force to his force pile, the player will pick a time when youre not paying attention to throw a few cards back to his force pile. This is especially done when he needs something done during your turn and he plays an interrupt such as Its A Trap! when he only had 2 force saved during the end of his turn.<br>
<br>
Stacking destinies: Battle destiny will oftentimes determine to outcome of a battle. Such being the case, players will love to make sure thier destinies are nice and high so they kill of your key characters while leaving you with your luck to kill of thiers. This is the same as the trick above, but is alot harder to catch until its been done.<br>
<br>
These are only a few ways of doing it, there are alot more. But to prevent this article from turing into an article for people to come to for methods of cheating, I must stop here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prevention of the Obvious<br>
<br>
<br>
So how do you stop people from cheating? The main key is to pay attention to what they are doing at all times. This is something alot of good players do already, so its not something new. A popular habit people have when playing is when a player starts to draw, the other player will activate. This is not only rude, but its key to making sure you know what your oppponent is up to. You can always ask how much your opponent has in his hand and how much he has activated. At this point, there is very little he can do to cheat you other than using whatever is already on table.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dont Overdo It<br>
<br>
<br>
Dont badger your opponent because you suspect him. This makes you more of a bad player then the cheater himself. If you do catch a player cheating, its up to you what you want to do with him. He certainly deserves capital punishment, but alot of players will avoid this trouble and give you a warning. Dont expect this treatment all the time......the more you cheat, the more players will not enjoy playing you, and the more harsh the punishment each time you cheat.<br>
<br>
<br>
A Word to Everyone<br>
<br>
If you cheat, take my advice and DONT. It's not worth it. Ive never cheated before, simply because, hey, I just dont need to cheat to win. Build your confidence, and make your decks right and you should not feel the need to cheat again. If you build a career on cheating players and being dishonest, then your reputation will proceed you. Players will take your games with them as more of a chore than anything else, and even less players will want to take you anywhere anymore. Take note and dont make a bad reputation for yourself. Its only a matter of time before someone catches you.....once they do, youre screwed. Keep this game and it's community honest and trustworthy......Its up to you.(Could this be more corny?:)<br>
