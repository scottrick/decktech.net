I happen to agree with those people. Sometimes I consider this a good thing, because deck building can be fun and challenging at the same time, plus the deck building process will in turn make you a better player. But this does have a somewhat negative effect on the game as well, because sometimes a game will come down to who has the deeper pocket book, or the access to the most cards. It is quite hard to build a competitive deck with no rares in it, but it is possible. I am going to present a deck that can be built with very few packs and can be competitive at the same time. In fact if you buy both the Aragorn and the Gandalf starters you are well on your way to building this deck. At the end of the article about the deck I have compiled a list of rares I consider to be worthy of trading for. Here is the deck.<br>
<br>
Frodo, Son of Drogo<br>
The One Ring, The Ruling Ring<br>
<br>
This part is obvious because the other versions of these cards are both rare.<br>
<br>
Sites - 9<br>
1 - East Road<br>
2 - Buckleberry Ferry<br>
3 - Frodo&#39;s Bedroom<br>
4 - Pass of Caradhras<br>
5 - The Bridge of Khazad-dum<br>
6 - Lothlorien Woods<br>
7 - Anduin Wilderland<br>
8 - Brown Lands<br>
9 - Summit of Amon Hen<br>
<br>
I chose the sites for various reasons. The site 1 doesn&#39;t matter for this deck, so I picked the one that could possibly hurt the opponent. The site 2 is perfect for a deck like this one as it keeps them from fighting you. Site 3-6 are picked because they help the opponent the least or provide the least amount of twilight for those sites. Site 7 is to skip the dreaded archery phase, site 8 and 9 are both for the shadow half.<br>
<br>
First lets go through the Free Peoples half.<br>
<br>
Companions - 3<br>
Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine (start)<br>
Sam, Son of Hamfast (start)<br>
Pippin, A Hobbit of Some Intelligence (start)<br>
<br>
These 3 guys are not the greatest of fighters, but they are really good at avoiding the early fights, and can go quite large later on in the game, especially Merry.<br>
<br>
Events - 13<br>
Hobbit Stealth x4<br>
Hobbit Intuition x4<br>
Dagger Strike x4<br>
Hobbit Appetite<br>
<br>
The 8 Stealth cards are for making it through sites 1-5 with relative ease. Dagger Strike is for the later game, but can easily be used early if the situation arises. Hobbit Appetite is there to get double use out of one of your Hobbits, usually either Merry or Sam.<br>
<br>
Possessions - 4<br>
Hobbit Sword x4<br>
<br>
Makes the tiny hobbits a bit bigger, plus is required for Dagger Strike. Always make sure Merry is the first to get a sword.<br>
<br>
Conditions - 6<br>
There and Back Again x4<br>
A Talent For Not Being Seen x2<br>
<br>
There and Back Again is a great card for a deck with all the Hobbits. It gives them all a bonus, and makes it very hard to overwhelm them, and they can take quite a beating as long as they are not overwhelmed. A Talent for Not Being Seen is used to cut back on some of the twilight you give the opponent, which is not very much to begin with.<br>
<br>
Allies - 4<br>
Thrarin, Dwarven Smith x4<br>
<br>
Thrarin is like a stealth card for sites 6-9. If they play a minion you can&#39;t handle, exert Thrarin during the maneuver phase and let him take the beating for you. A really underrated card in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Well that gives us a 30 card Free Peoples deck made of commons and uncommons, so lets take a look at the Shadow half.<br>
<br>
Minions - 20<br>
Moria Scout x4<br>
Goblin Marksman x4<br>
Goblin Scavenger x4<br>
Goblin Runner x4<br>
Goblin Wallcrawler x4<br>
<br>
That&#39;s about as straight forward as you can get. Remember to always try and keep your Shadow half of the deck to about as close to 2/3s of the deck as possible. In other words I always like to put 20 minions in a 30 card shadow deck like this one. There were a bunch of Moria Orcs to choose from so I tried to narrow it down. The Runner and Scout are both great, because they allow you to swarm an opponent. The Scout also has 2 vitality which is a must against an archery deck for soaking up some of the wounds. The Wallcrawler is in here because of the archery problem as well. You will learn why the Scavengers are here in a minute, beside the fact that they have high strength for their twilight. The Marksman are relatively cheap archers, so they made the cut.<br>
<br>
Possessions - 4<br>
Goblin Scimitar x4<br>
<br>
This card is great. Often times you will draw more minions to play, and then you will be able to overwhelm the ring bearer easier. It&#39;s good to play this card multiple times with the Scavengers listed above. Remember that you don&#39;t have to play the scimitar on the Scavengers if there is another minion in play to put it on. I often like to put it on the Scouts myself.<br>
<br>
Events - 4<br>
Host of Thousands x4<br>
<br>
This card is sort of the wild card of Moria Swarm. It can pretty much become a copy of any orc you need. Want to play the scimitar again, that Scavenger would be great. One twilight shy of going off, that Runner solves that problem pretty well. Etc., Etc.<br>
<br>
Conditions - 2<br>
They Are Coming x2<br>
<br>
A lot of people call this a worse version of Goblin Swarms. While I&#39;ll agree that Goblin Swarms is a great card (also Rare), I also think that They Are Coming is an amazing card. It lets you take advantage of drawing back up to 8 at the end of every turn, and lets you get a Goblin back at the same time. This card can single handedly win you a ton of games.<br>
<br>
Well, thats it for the deck. There are really 2 different ways to play the deck. You can move along the path at a slow and steady pace and swarm them with goblins when you get the chance, or if you draw a bunch of free peoples cards you can move a couple of sites at a time. If you are a little strapped for cash, or don&#39;t have a job, you should give this deck a try. You might even be able to get most of the cards you need for it from a friend at your local store.<br>

Please keep in mind that this is not a defenitive list of all the best cards in the set, it is just my opinion of which rare cards are the most playable, and which ones you should be on the lookout for when trading or buying cards. If you think I forget a rare that deserves to be on the list. or if you think one of the ones I listed doesn&#39;t belong there, d-mail me and I&#39;ll see what I can do.<br>
