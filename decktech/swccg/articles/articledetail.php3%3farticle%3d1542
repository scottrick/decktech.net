Let us take a look back on the many faces of &amp;#8220;Wormie.&amp;#8221;<br>
<br>
We met this young punk whiney kid in Premier; lets take a look at him in his first construction -<br>
<br>
*Luke Skywalker  - Rebel, Destiny 1<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Son of Anakin Skywalker.  Student of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Honed piloting skills by targeting Womp Rats in Beggar&amp;#8217;s Canyon aboard T-16 Skyhopper.<br>
Power 3; Ability 4; Force-Sensitive, Deploy 3; Forfeit 7<br>
Gametext &amp;#8211; You may activate 1 extra Force if Luke is present at a non- Tatooine location.  Adds 3 to power of any starship he pilots.  On Red 5, also adds 2 to Maneuver.  Immune to attrition &lt; 3.<br>
<br>
Luke was really good when the set came out, and in all honesty, he is still a very powerful card to be used in SWCCG.  With a very frugal deploy cost, and a high forfeit value; &amp;#8220;Wormie&amp;#8221; is a card that can add some extra bonuses to a LS deck.  Looking beyond that, we find what this version of Luke can really do to enhance a LS deck.<br>
<br>
Wormie adds 3 to the power of anything he pilots, making him the best Pilot Luke in the game.  When he is in his trusty T-65 X-Wing &amp;#8220;Red 5&amp;#8221;, he is part of a Power 6, maneuver 6 powerhouse in space.  Or you can use the enhanced version of Red 5, Artoo-Detoo in Red 5 from the Third Anthology, and then you would have a Power 8 beast that Luke deploys for free to.	Over all, his ability to add 3 to anything he pilots and his deploy value being so low, Premier Luke is probably the best star pilot you can get in a version of Luke.	But Wormie&amp;#8217;s skills do not stop there.<br>
<br>
&amp;#8220;You may activate 1 extra Force if Luke is present at a non-Tatooine location.&amp;#8221;  This is an extra bonus for the LS.  If you use Wormie in a Hoth deck, then you will be able to add 1 extra to your activation, which might be the difference between the beat down of a Star Destroyer, or waiting until next turn to deploy the Falcon.  This added ability in Wormie is just another reason why he is a very powerful card and why he is still in use today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, so he went and killed some Storm troopers, saved a chick, and then blew up the Happy Fun Ball.  Luke was on his way.  We next met Luke on the remote planet of Hoth.<br>
<br>
*Commander Luke Skywalker &amp;#8211; Rebel, Destiny 1<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Hero of Yavin.  Promoted to Commander in his third year of military training with the Alliance.  Squadron flight leader at Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth.<br>
Power 4; Ability 4; Force-Sensitive; Deploy 4; Forfeit 7<br>
Gametext &amp;#8211; Deploy only on Hoth, but may move elsewhere.  Adds 3 to the power of any starship he pilots.  On Rogue 1, adds 2 to maneuver.  Immune to attrition &lt; 3.  Forfeit +1 to all Rogue Squadron pilots &amp; gunners at same Hoth site.<br>
<br>
Now Luke is becoming more of a bad ass.  He is +1 in the power department now and he still has the same ability and addition to the starship power level.  One problem with this version is that he can only deploy to Hoth, a planet location that many people have stayed away from playing in favor of other locations, with the current exception now of playing EBO with A New Secret Base.  Due to the lack of interest in playing on Hoth, and better versions of him being available from later sets, Commander Luke Skywalker has always been over looked when it comes time for deck building.  But, let us look at him anyway.<br>
<br>
As stated before, he adds 3 to the power of anything he pilots, so he is as good a pilot as they come.	He has a low deploy cost, however that is almost negated due to the deployment restrictions that are imposed on him.  If you do play with other Rogue Squadron pilots or the Gunners, he does add one to their forfeit, this when added to the +2 they could receive from Insurrection, could save a couple of Force in a battle.<br>
<br>
The really strong thing that came for Commander Luke Skywalker came from the Hoth set, and is actually not really for him anyway, Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber.  Up until the release of Hoth, all Luke could do was watch Obi-Wan Kenobi slice up the DS characters and dream of a day when he could be along side of him doing the same&amp;#8230;or he could use the Jedi Lightsaber from Premier, but who wanted to use that on Luke?  With the introduction of Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, Luke, (or his sister), could begin slicing through the opponents and adding to Force Drains.  Over all though, this had little effect on Commander Luke Skywalker, who mostly remains in everyone&amp;#8217;s trade binder, even as a Reflection FOIL.<br>
<br>
<br>
So now Luke got his face smashed in by a Wampa, (or was it a car accident?), learned where he was to go to continue his Jedi training, got shot down in his T-47, and crashed his X-Wing in a swamp.  That is where we found him next, on the planet of Dagobah, under a new name.<br>
<br>
*Son Of Skywalker<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Luke Skywalker. Son of Anakin.  Seeker of Yoda.  Levitator of Rocks.  Ignorer of Advice.  Incapable of impossible.  Reckless is he.<br>
Power 5; Ability 5; Force-Sensitive; Deploy 5; Forfeit 8<br>
Game text &amp;#8211; Deploys only on Dagobah or Cloud City, but may move elsewhere.  Adds 2 to the power of any starship he pilots.  Once per game, a Lightsaber may deploy here (for free) directly from Reserve Deck.<br>
Shuffle, cut, replace.	Immune to attrition &lt; 4.<br>
<br>
Now we got our first view of a Luke that we all could be proud of.  He was a powerful character, could have his fathers Lightsaber deployed to him for free from the Reserve Deck, and had a high forfeit value.  This version of Luke was &amp; still is a very popular one.  Lets look at him deeper.<br>
<br>
He only adds 2 to the power of anything he pilots.  Is that why he crashed his X-Wing into the swamp?  Did the Bacta Tank sap his pilot skills to fix his face?  Anyway, he isn&amp;#8217;t anything special in the piloting department anymore, which is good considering that he should no longer be in Space, but on the ground.  You fit him with a Lightsaber, Anakin&amp;#8217;s or his new one from DSII, and he is on a hunting mission.  If you are using him to Train on Dagobah, you then use his game text to fetch Luke&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, which adds one to his Training Destiny draws, and you are one step faster to completing your training.  This with the other extra Training gear, you are training at Light speed.<br>
<br>
Other than the obvious good things about SOS, there isn&amp;#8217;t mush else to him, which is cool, because there doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be anything else.	He is a very good version, and is still in popular use today.<br>
<br>
Now we came to a drought in the Luke production line.  Cloudy City was released with out a version of Luke, as was Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace and Special Edition.  Then we were given a sort of sneak preview with the Enhanced Premier Pack cards.<br>
<br>
*Luke with Lightsaber &amp;#8211; Rebel, Destiny 1<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve Taken Care of Everything.&amp;#8221;<br>
Power 5, Ability 5, Force-Sensitive, Deploy 5, Forfeit 7<br>
Gametext &amp;#8211; Adds 2 to the power of anything he pilots. Permanent Weapon is Luke&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber (may target a character or creature for free; draw two destiny; target hit, and is forfeit = 0, if total destiny &gt; defensive value).<br>
<br>
This, by far, has been the most popular Luke that has been released.  The fact that he has no deployment restrictions, has a built in weapon, and can kick ass, made him a mainstay in almost every LS deck.  A popular use with EPP Luke was to buddy him up with is first mentor, in a new version also, Ben Kenobi from Special Edition.  Ben Kenobi could revive, or bring back a character forfeited from the same location.  EPP Luke could be forfeited for 7, and then brought back to slice up another character next turn.  He also was given fame in the Maelstrom decks, due to his built in weapon and the way that EPP Han played off of him.  He has currently been found mostly in copies of three in Yavin IV Throne Room decks.<br>
<br>
The main problem that EPP Luke had was that he had no immunity to Attrition, thus a destiny draw of 1 would smack him to the lost pile.  Understanding that this was done so that the EPP&amp;#8217;s would not become overly powerful, but it would have been nice to have them at least stand up to a destiny draw of 1.<br>
<br>
EPP Luke is probably, even with the release of DSII, the most widely used version of Luke, due to the weight that he brings to the table, and the availability that Decipher made of him.  By being offered in the EPP boutique packs, this gave a way for players to get copies of the powerful mains, and multiple copies at that.  He is the most widely used main, and with good reason.<br>
<br>
<br>
After the release of the EPP&amp;#8217;s, two other boutique sets were printed, ECC (Enhanced Cloud City, which gave us Lando with Colt .45) and EJP (Enhanced Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace).  In the EJP packs we were given another version of Luke, Master Luke, as well as another threat to him, in the form of Mara Jade, The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Hand.<br>
<br>
*Master Luke &amp;#8211; Rebel, Destiny 1<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Until being reunited with Yoda, Luke had suspected that he had completed his training.  Has a strong influence on the weak-minded.<br>
Power 6; Ability 5; Force-Sensitive; Deploy 7, Forfeit 7<br>
Game text &amp;#8211; Deploys &amp;#8211;2 on Tatooine.  Power &amp;#8211; 2 when present with Vader.  Adds 2 to the power of anything he pilots.  When in battle, may target one opponent&amp;#8217;s alien present.  Draw destiny.  Target returns to opponent&amp;#8217;s hand if destiny is &gt; ability.  Immune to attrition &lt; 4.<br>
<br>
This version of Luke was a great addition to the line.	He had a power boost and was still the deploy 5 Luke we all were used to, when he deploys to Tatooine.	His piloting skills hadn&amp;#8217;t improved, but with his ability to bounce one Alien back to your opponent&amp;#8217;s hand in a battle, who needs him in space?  Paired up with Ben Kenobi on Tatooine, this is a Lethal combo.  An added bonus was the LS Objective from the EJP set, You May Profit By This, or Be Destroyed.  The 0 side of the Objective allows you to deploy Master Luke for free, which means more of a beat down.  Overall, Master Luke was a great card.<br>
<br>
Master Luke also had his weakness&amp;#8217; that were understandable.	When present with Vader, he was power &amp;#8211; 2.  This made sense because he wasn&amp;#8217;t a Jedi yet and wasn&amp;#8217;t sure of himself.  Even with this weakness, matched with Luke&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, or Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, Master Luke is a Badass dude.<br>
<br>
<br>
After he saved his friend from a Slimy gangster, and got his new hand shot, (I have to ask, in the movie, Luke has his hand up in the air, What the hell was he doing?), and went to Dagobah to find some things out.  He later duels his father again, (without losing a limb this time) and becomes a Jedi.<br>
<br>
*Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight &amp;#8211; Rebel Destiny 6<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Scout trained in the ways of the Force.  Key figure for both the Alliance and the Empire.  Desired by Vader as an ally, by Palpatine as a servant and the Alliance as its savior.<br>
Power 6; Ability 6; Jedi Knight; Deploy 8; Forfeit 9<br>
Gametext &amp;#8211; Deploys &amp;#8211;3 to Home One or on Endor.  Adds 2 to power of<br>
anything he pilots.  Power +2 when armed with a Lightsaber.  Subtracts 3 from any attempt to cross him over (even if captured).  Immune to attrition &lt; 5 (&lt; 6 if alone or armed with a Lightsaber, or &lt; 7 if both).<br>
<br>
Now we come to the guy who should have &amp;#8220;Bad Mutha Fucker&amp;#8221; printed on his Lightsaber.  Jedi Luke is a beast.  He is a power 8 with his beating stick, and immune to most destiny draws.  He does it all.  When playing on Endor or deploying him to Home One, he deploys the same as Son Of Skywalker or EPP Luke.  He has a destiny number of 6!  You draw him for destiny, and you can say good by to Vader.  You squeak through a tournament playing number?  You can use Jedi Luke.   You get into an Epic Duel with Vader?  Ability 6 baby, and you win.  Mara jade ain&amp;#8217;t a dueling problem with this guy.<br>
<br>
Jedi Luke is the most powerful the LS gets in the game.  By having him be this powerful, you can build a deck that allows you to train his sister, and not have to worry about him getting picked off like EPP Luke would.<br>
<br>
Some of his drawbacks are most importantly, if I am not playing on Endor, I am paying through the nose for him to hit the table.  If you go up against a RalOps deck, then expect Jedi Luke to cost around 12 Force to get down to Rallitir, then expect the reacting groups to make their way over to see that nice, expensive, Ultra Rare.<br>
<br>
Mostly, other than is deploy cost, Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, has no problems.  He is cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, with the exception of 2 Player Luke, that is it.	Well, here he is anyways&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
*Luke &amp;#8211; Rebel, Destiny 1<br>
Lore &amp;#8211; Raised by Guardians Owen and Beru Lars on a Moisture Farm on Tatooine, where Owen wanted him to stay.	Nicknamed &amp;#8220;Wormie&amp;#8221; by childhood friends Camie and Fixer.<br>
Power 2; Ability 3; Force &amp;#8211;Attuned; Deploy 4; Forfeit 4<br>
Gametext &amp;#8211; Must deploy on Tatooine, but may move elsewhere.  May not be deployed if two or more of opponent&amp;#8217;s (*) characters on table.  Your Warriors at same site as Luke, or adjacent sites, are forfeit +1.<br>
<br>
Well&amp;#8230;. not much to say other than he sucks when compared to the other versions that have been released.  For the format that he was designed to be used in, he isn&amp;#8217;t bad at all.  In fact, Michael Girard has said that he wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind using him in a Sealed Deck tournament.  I once built a Jedi Test deck and used him to train.  It was funny watching him use Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Luke has gone from a humble beginning to becoming the most powerful card in the game.	You will not find too many decks built for the LS that do not include one version of another of Luke Skywalker.  His growth and maturation has gone along the same lines as SWCCG itself.  Commander Luke Skywalker is like the type of LS decks that came out of Dagobah, powerful, but you cannot do much about them, if you are playing the DS.<br>
