They may not be the most powerful, or the most popular, but their presence on the table will force one player or the other to adjust the way they play.  I will not be listing cards such as Dark Deal or EBO in this article, because they really belong in only one deck.  I also chose not to include cards like the grabber effects or the SAC defense effects, because they only limit the play of specific cards.  True, the grabbers can target any interrupt, but only that one interrupt.  I intend to use examples that are more versatile than that.  <br>
<br>
10.  I Hope She&#146;s Alright/Search And Destroy<br>
<br>
Of all the effects I selected for this list, this one is probably both the easiest to circumvent and the least popular, making it a natural choice for the number 10 spot.  However, it is potentially devastating to the unprepared.  The extra loss of one force at the end of each players turn can add up very quickly.  This effect can be ruinous to those who have no way to deal with it.  To others, it can simply force a critical mistake.  I fell victim to this effect myself at Dantooine Regionals this year, losing my only game of the day because I was tempted into preventing the damage.  The battle that followed broke my game.<br>
<br>
9.  Resistance/Ultimatum<br>
<br>
The influence of these two effects has dissipated since they were introduced.  However, their ability to limit damage from both force drains and insert cards is still quite powerful.  I think most of the older players will agree that inserts were perhaps the worst cards ever printed by Decipher (although many now rate podracing that badly too).  Thus, by limiting the power of inserts, these may have been two of the best cards released in the Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace expansion.<br>
<br>
8.  Bad Feeling Have I/Goo Ne Tay<br>
<br>
I think it is safe to say that mains have been and always will be the most popular characters to play with.  These effects restrict mains to a degree by increasing their deploy cost.  When used as part of a force choke/denial deck, these cards are devastating.  Their vulnerability to Alter, and thus, not being able to start them with Heading For The Medical Frigate or Prepared Defenses is why they are only number 8 on my list.<br>
<br>
7.  Aim High/Secret Plans<br>
<br>
Force retrieval is an extremely powerful tool.  Thus, the ability to limit, restrict and/or reduce force retrieval is also extremely powerful.  In addition to forcing your opponent to save force in order to pay for their force retrieval, each of these effects has a secondary text that can be useful.  I would have rated them higher on my list, except that Aim High in my opinion is not as strong as Secret Plans, because the Dark Side has only a few ways to retrieve force.<br>
<br>
6.  Draw Their Fire/First Strike<br>
<br>
Force Retrieval and Direct Damage all in the same package.  Combine this with the ability to force the opponent to save additional force to play his interrupts, and you have a very powerful effect.  Beware the double-edged sword, this effect can come back and bite you just as readily as your opponent.  Thus, I rank it 6th.<br>
<br>
5.  Mobilization Point/Staging Areas<br>
<br>
A deck without force generation is a deck that will lose.  Effects that enhance your force generation will always be powerful.  Mobilization Points has the added bonus of being able to pull a system, or even the Executor out of your reserve deck.  Staging Areas is clearly not as powerful as Mob. Points however, because its secondary game text is not all that useful.  Combined with the fact that these effects really need their &quot;search for a docking bay&quot; counterparts to see their full potential, they slide in to 5th place on my list.<br>
<br>
4.  Battle Order/Battle Plan<br>
<br>
As is the case with Draw Their Fire and First Strike, these effects can be viewed as double-edged swords.  However, their power cannot be denied.  Most decks that see tournament play usually favor either space or ground.  I refer to these decks as one-dimensional.  They are either extremely weak in one arena, or lack the ability to have any kind of presence in that arena at all.  An obvious example would be the typical Profit deck, which does not have a single starship in it.  Battle Order and Battle Plan allow you to dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the one-dimensional speed drain deck.  They give you the extra time you need to get your own strategy going, whatever that might be.<br>
<br>
3.  Imperial Decree/Menace Fades<br>
<br>
Perhaps more so than any other effects on this list, Imperial Decree and Menace Fades can force interaction in a game.  By controlling the right locations, you can totally negate your opponents force drain bonuses, potentially giving you the edge in the drain race.  Now your opponent must make a choice.  They must either attempt to deny you control of a key location, or disrupt your drains in another manner.  Either way, they have to bring the game to you. <br>
<br>
2.  Imperial Arrest Order/Insurrection<br>
<br>
These effects are so potent that they make it into almost every deck you see.  With the ability to pull locations from your reserve deck, add to the forfeit of your characters, and prevent the Ellis Herlot/Nabrun Leids beat down, there is almost no reason NOT to play with these effects.  Combined with Mobilization Points and Staging Areas respectively, they became the primary means of achieving large force generation after the release of Death Star II.  Now you need fewer locations to generate the same amount of force, leaving yourself additional card slots in your deck.  Truly two of my favorite cards in the game.<br>
<br>
1.  An Unusual Amount Of Fear/Fear Is My Ally<br>
<br>
Most of you could see this choice coming.  No other effects in the game are as versatile as these, because they are effectively three effects for the cost of one.  They provide a wide variety of benefits, depending on what you need.  Insert or Podrace protection, retrieval reduction/limitation, force drain reduction/limitation, and a variety of other possibilities.  They even allow you to use other effects on this list, without having to make extra room for them.  These effects are so powerful, there are now decks, known as shield busters, designed specifically to counter the power of these cards.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Big Picture<br>
<br>
So what do these effects add up to?  They add up to a trend.  On the whole, the trend that develops from these effects seeing play is a trend towards high activation decks that rely on battles and beat downs to defeat the opponent.  They use cards like Battle Plan and Menace Fades to reduce the effectiveness of the opponents force drains, slowing him down long enough to bring the pain.  They force the opponent to deploy to battlegrounds, where they can be attacked.  Decks like Hunt Down and Senate Beats thrive on that sort of game, which is why they are so popular today.  Attack decks typically defeat decks that rely on non-interaction and force drains, because they force you to interact with them.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most powerful decks out there are those that can play both ways.  Decks that have a high damage potential when left alone often force interaction, and then seize the advantage by counter-attacking.  Dark Deal is a fine example of this.  Perhaps that is why top players like Brian Hunter enjoy playing it so much.  Likewise QMC works the same way.  Pucimir Thryss aids the light side in dealing tremendous damage, and cards like Path Of Least Resistance allow them to beat you down when you try to attack.  I enjoy playing a non-flip Set Your Course deck.  The Virtual text of Fear Will Keep Them In Line gives the deck a tremendous damage potential, and the cheap deploy of the non-unique star destroyers allows me to bring the beats to anyone who challenges my fleet.<br>
<br>
If you read current tournament reports, you will find that those players who do well typically play decks that either attack the opponent, or force the opponent to attack them, and then counter-attack.  With the current Meta, expect the following decks to do well in the hands of good players:<br>
<br>
Senate (Light or Dark)<br>
Hunt Down<br>
Dark Deal<br>
QMC<br>
WYS<br>
Set Your Course (Non-flip)<br>
<br>
The following decks, in my opinion, have the potential to do well, though they may not be as strong as those I listed above.<br>
<br>
ISB<br>
Combat (Light or Dark)<br>
BHBM<br>
MWYHL<br>
Throne Room/Force denial decks<br>
EBO<br>
<br>
The following decks, in my opinion, are not viable as competition decks because they either lack the versatility of those I named above, or do not have the ability to seize the initiative and take the game to the opponent.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base<br>
Endor Ops<br>
Rebel Strike Team<br>
Scum<br>
Profit<br>
<br>
<br>
While there was not a great deal of new information to be found in this article, I hope it helped to increase your awareness of the game environment, and some insight into why certain decks have such and advantage over others.  <br>
<br>
