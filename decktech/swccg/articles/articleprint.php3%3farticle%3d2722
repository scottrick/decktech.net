Dark Deal was one of the most powerful effects to the the table for Dark Side with its power and force drain bonuses. This was all well and good if you could get out the sites to set up the Deal. Since this was incredibly difficult, this effect saw little play. A few sets down the line Decipher decided they liked Cloud City and released a new effect to encourage players to pursue the Cloud City venue. Cloud City Occupation added to the wreaking ball of an engine that Dark Deal was with direct damage from controlling sites. Even with this dynamic duo of effects, few players used a Dark Side Cloud  City, unless it was for Sabacc (and this to was not used often). With the release of Enhanced Cloud City players got an objective, TDIGWATT, to help them out on the City in the Clouds. This objective helped players out by giving them two additional effects to start with, the ability to pull CCO, DD, Bespin, and Cloud City. While the objective provided many good benefits, it was just too hard to pull the other two locations to set up Dark Deal and thus, flip. In the Tatooine expansion Bid D included a &#146;helper&#146; or &#146;fixer&#146; card for this objective, I&#146;m Sorry, which allowed you to pull these crucial two additional sites. It did, however, stop you from playing Imp Barrier or SCrew. While Imp Barrier might be beneficial it is not necessary, and many can thrive without even looking at SCrew. On to the objective!<br>
<br>
First Side Text: [Deploy one Cloud City battleground site. May deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take Bespin system, Bespin: Cloud City, Dark Deal or Cloud City Occupation into hand from Reserve Deck| reshuffle. Your [Cloud City], [Jabba&#146;s Palace] and [Special Edition] characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay when deploying to Bespin Locations. {Flip} this card if Dark Deal on table and you occupy Bespin System and Bespin: Cloud City.<br>
<br>
Second Side Text: {While} this side up, Surreptitious Glance may not cancel Dark Deal, The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From is suspended if targeting Bespin. Opponent loses 8 Force when you play All Too Easy. At each Bespin location you control with an Imperial, your Force drains may not be modified by opponent. If you have an alien/imperial pair in battle, your total battle destiny is +2 (+4 if alien is an Ugnaught). {Flip} this card if Dark Deal is cancelled, if opponent controls Bespin or if Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;. <br>
<br>
Deploy on table. If This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time on table, once per game may take up to 2 interior Cloud City battlegrounds into hand from Reserve Deck. Reshuffle. You may not play Scanning Crew or Imperial Barrier. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
The front side of this objective gives you many advantages and no disadvantages. First, you are allowed to deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up, plus a Cloud City battleground. The ability to deploy those other two effects and still use Prepared Defenses gave you the ability to throw down up to five effects before you even draw your hand!  The one starting location is rather lame, as other objectives deploy many more.  However, the objective does deal with this problem by allowing you to pull Bespin and Cloud City. The objective also helps further your efforts to flip by allowing you to pull both the Deal and Occupation. Also, some of your characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay when dropping down in the clouds. Flipping is rather hard, forcing you to have an excellent mix of characters and starships because you must control three Cloud City sites and occupy both Bespin and Cloud City.<br>
<br>
The flip side of this objective provides some excellent game text. Your opponent may not cancel Dark Deal with Surreptious Glance and The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From may not target Bespin. In addition, your battle destiny is plus two in battles with both your alien and imperial. If you choose to play a deck <br>
with All Too Easy your opponent loses eight force each time you play it. These benefits are all well and good, however, the can be short lived. If at any time you don&#146;t occupy Bespin, your objective flips back, which ain&#146;t great. Or, if your opponent is playing a heavy ground deck, he can cancel DD to flip you over. Therefore, you should pack heavy space to protect Bespin and Cloud City, and heavy ground to protect Dark Deal, which can be nearly impossible with only sixty cards in your deck.<br>
<br>
As stated previously, the way to flip your objective is to occupy both Cloud City and Bespin and to have Dark Deal thrown out. With the new card, I&#146;m Sorry, you can&#146;t use exterior sites so no walkers to get DD going. The exact mix of location choices really depends on each individual deck. I have compiled a list of the interior locations and their bonuses:<br>
<br>
Cloud City: Carbonite Chamber--+2 to Carbon Freezing destiny. <br>
Cloud City: Chasm Walkway--If Weather Vane on table, characters &#146;hit&#146; here are instead immediately        relocated there.<br>
Cloud City: Dining Room--Your characters and character weapons may deploy here as a &#146;react.&#146;  <br>
Cloud City: Incinerator--If you control, during your control phase, may use 2 Force to retrieve one droid.  <br>
Cloud City: Lower Corridor--Your characters with lightsabers are each power +2 here.  <br>
Cloud City: Security Tower--Once per game, may search your Reserve Deck, take Lando into hand and reshuffle.  <br>
Cloud City: Upper Plaza Corridor-- During your move phase, you may move between here and any Cloud City site for free.  <br>
Cloud City: Interrogation Room--For each captive present, Force drain +1 (+1 more if captive is a unique Rebel). <br>
Cloud City: West Galler--Your blasters present may fire at targets at nearest related exterior site.  <br>
<br>
You&#146;ll want to have some strong mains running around the city to protect the Deal. I like to use heavy hitters (i.e Star Destroyers) at Bespin to protect CCO. Use the OS-72-1 in Obsidian 1 and his partner along with some bounty hunter ships at Cloud City to flip. Another way to help flip is to put out some inexpensive, less powerful characters and use lift tubes and play the deck much like the QMC deck of today if your opponent comes after you. If you want to keep DD in play without having to beat everyone off Cloud City, you can use some beneficial little aliens called Aqualish&#146;s. Imperial Arrest Order will keep those mains from Naburning over. You&#146;ll also want to pack several Ghhhks if you decide to spread.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to play the objective which has seen a recent resurrection, TDIGWATT. Here are some of the more prominent ones:<br>
<br>
An Entire Legion- Stormtroopers. Yes, stormtroopers. These men in white are often pictured as being weak and pathetic, however, with the Admiral&#146;s Order, Intensify the Forward Batteries, these guys will be marching around with a little more bounce in their step as they are now an incredible defense value of 6.  This combined with Trooper Assaults could make Cloud City a very formidable stronghold.<br>
<br>
Bounty- By packing several bounties and hunters in combination with Dark Deal and by including a small carbon freeze theme this has the potential to be a good deck. However, there are many weakness of this archetype. Your forfeit is incredibly low, thus if you get in a large battle against insane destiny adders, you  could possibly lose the game right then and there. It also might prove difficult to grab all of the components, put them out, and still have cards in your deck.<br>
<br>
Sabacc- Before Tatooine was released players used Any Methods Necessary to grab the SecTower to have a first turn Lando at the Casino (starting location) and to use him and Lobot to set up super retrieval. While Lando was busy betting his life away, your mains would run around and smack then drain. However, now if you want to use I&#146;m Sorry and set up the Deal, Sabacc isn&#146;t really viable because you can&#146;t get that early Lando.<br>
<br>
Here are some prime examples of TDIGWATT at work:<br>

http://decktech.net/swccg/decks/dark/darkdetail.php3?deck=16957<br>
<br>
In conclusion, TDIGWATT has the potential to become one of the dominant decktypes, however, the newly revitalized QMC might gve it a few problems, like not being able to set up the Deal or flip. Even with the problems against QMC, the possibilities for TDIGWATT are endless.<br>

I hope this article helped some scrubs (or non-), opened some eyes, or didn&amp;#8217;t bore you too much. Please check back soon as there will be an article on QMC next, then on even more objectives as time goes on. Also please read the article on SYCFA and MBO on my page. <br>

Thanks for reading, <br>

Post Script: If some of the spacing is off, please don&amp;#8217;t hurt me. It was looking a-okay in WordPad, but once it got into Decktech&amp;#8217;s word processor it screwed up, so I don&amp;#8217;t know if it will return to normal. <br>
<br>
Post Post Script: If there are any tags, it ain&amp;#8217;t my fault. They were not there in Decktech&amp;#8217;s word processor so it&amp;#8217;s all good... <br>
