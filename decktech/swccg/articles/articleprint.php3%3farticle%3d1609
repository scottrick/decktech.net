So your making your decks and you come around the time to pick and choose your starships.  Youve got you Mon Cals, Corvettes, Frigates	and Snub fighters.  There is<br>
a hole, and its left by the infamous freighter, the Millenium Falcon. So which one do you choose?  Lets start off with some game text.	(BEWARE: This is my first article, and a long one at that. Please be kind :)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gold Squadron 1 Destiny 3<br>
Deploy	3 Forfeit 7 Power 3 Maneuver 5 Hyperspeed 6 Astromech<br>
Deploy minus two on Endor. May add 2 pilots and 2 passengers.  Immune to Tallon Roll.<br>
Immune to attrition below 4 when Lando or Nien Numb piloting(6 if both)<br>
<br>
Millenium Falcon Destiny 2<br>
Deploy 3 Forfeit 7 Power 3 Maneuver 4 Hyperspeed 6 Astromech<br>
May add two pilots or two passengers.  Immune to attrition below 5 if Han, Chewie, or<br>
lando piloting.  Has ship docking capability.<br>
<br>
Lando in Millenium Falcon<br>
Deploy 5 Forfeit 6 Power 3 Maneuver 3 Hyperspeed 5 Astromech  [independent]<br>
May add 1 pilot and 2 passengers.  Permanent pilot is Lando who provides ability 3 and<br>
adds 3 to power.  May not be piloted by Han unless he won a hand of Sabbac this game.<br>
Immune to attrition below 5.<br>
<br>
Ok, lets start with Gold Squadron 1.<br>
ADVANTAGES:  Low deploy, high forfeit.	Most maneuverable of the bunch, in a day<br>
and age where starship weapons are becoming viable again.  It is immune to Tallon roll,<br>
another old idea being slightly resurrected.  It has a high immunity to attrition when both<br>
its matching pilots are aboard.  Its deploy -2 to Endor makes it a good choice for a Rebel<br>
Strike Team or Endor Uprising deck.  Excellent destiny for a starship. Able to be deployed<br>
via Squadron assignments.<br>
<br>
DISADVANTAGES: Lower immunity when only one pilot aboard.  Thats all I can think<br>
of!<br>
<br>
COMBOS:  As it may be pulled with squadron assignments, this can set up a SuperFalcon<br>
on the first or second turn.  Start strike planning, squadron assignments and another effect<br>
in your Endor uprising or RST deck(useful effects anyway), pull General Solo/Calrissian<br>
from reserve, and use them to pull GS1 via Squadron Assignments. If you use Calrissian,<br>
thats a Power 6 Maneuver 6 Hyperspeed 6 ship that deploys for 3 force and draws on<br>
destiny. Not bad, eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
On to the Millenium Falcon.<br>
ADVANTAGES: Low deploy, high forfeit.  Excellent hyperspeed.  Only one pilot needed<br>
for high immunity, making this ship the most versatile.  It has three matching pilots, all of<br>
them adding at least two to power and one to maneuver.	Decent destiny	May be pulled<br>
by Squadron Assignments.<br>
<br>
DISADVANTAGES: Less maneuverable than GS1, leaving it more susceptible to starship<br>
weapons.  Lower destiny, also.<br>
<br>
COMBOS:  The above strike planning/Squadron Assignments combo can also be used<br>
with the Falcon, but a better choice for this falcon is to put Han on it.  Its his ship, after<br>
all.  Captain Han Solo is your man for the job.  He adds 3 to power, 2 to maneuver and a<br>
battle destiny. Put him, General Calrissian, EPP Leia and Nien Numb in this Falcon and<br>
youll have a Power 9 Maneuver 7 ship that draws four destiny, cancels an opponents<br>
destiny(and cause a re-draw) and adds 2 to your total if you need to blow up the DS2.<br>
And thats without your teamwork cards!<br>
<br>
Finally we have Lando in Millenium Falcon.<br>
ADVANTAGES: Immune to attrition below 5 without any modifying.	Provides ability of<br>
3, and is immune to Tallon roll because.......LiMF is the only independent Falcon. Also, if<br>
you get this out first, you can screw the darkside by making them unable to deploy their<br>
version of Lando.<br>
<br>
DISADVANTAGES:	May not be pulled by squadron assignments.  Does not draw a<br>
destiny alone.	Hogs up the Lando persona, making him unable to be of your services<br>
blowing up Death Stars, spying on Jabba, running his independent operation, or playing<br>
Sabbac.  Han cant pilot this version of the falcon unless he wins a hand of Sabbac<br>
<br>
COMBOS: If you can get him out quick, he makes the opponent unable to deploy Lando,<br>
hurting CC sabbac retrieval, as well as many other strategies.	Also you can put down<br>
another pilot to draw destiny, and add power.<br>
<br>
So whats the best Falcon to use? Well, in a deck where you want Han on the ground<br>
(Profit, RST), either Gold Squadron 1 or Lando in MF would be your best choice.  As<br>
stated earlier, the Millenium Falcon is versatile fits well in any deck.  In a very card<br>
intensive deck(MWYHL, some types of HB and EBO), Lando in MF is probably your best<br>
bet.<br>
<br>
Thanx for reading, I hope I informed you of something you didnt know, and made<br>
choosing the right Falcon easier.  Thanx for your reviews, and may the force be with<br>
you(had to say it, sorry :) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
