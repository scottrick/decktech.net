<br>
    Swccg has definitely changed.  It used to be Force Drain, Force Drain, Force Drain.  Now it's battle, battle, battle.  Now for those of you a little new to battling you are probably wondering how you can best take advantage of this.  Hopefully, this article will give you some ideas.  For those of you who have been around for awhile, hopefully this article will give you some new insights into a way to really put a hurting on your opponents through the technique I call 'Removal'.<br>
<br>
    One of the biggest differences between Battling and Force Draining is the amount of damage you can inflict in one shot.  A 'big' force drain is about 4 or 5 lost force.	A 'big' battle damage is anywhere from 10 to 30 (and up!) in force loss (after forfeit).  Amazing difference, isn't it?   There are three practical ways to rack up the massive power needed to inflict this sort of damage.  One is through Destiny Adders.  By using the appropriate interrupts, several battle destinies can be drawn.  When combined with set up destinies of 5 and 6, this can add up to a tremendous amount of power.	A drawback to this is that you have to use several lost interrupts, and a decent amount of skill is needed to follow this plan through.  Also, the new effect Crush the Rebellion can severely hamper this, as well as other cards like Wounded Wookie.  Another way to maximize damage is to simply build up a huge amount of power.  Interrupts like Jedi/Dark Jedi Presence combined with Trooper Assaults or Courage of a Skywalker are often used, or effects such as the dreaded S-foils or Maneuvering Flaps combined with a 'swarm' can produce absolutely lethal amounts of power.  The third way is slightly different as it focuses on reducing the opponent's power rather than increasing yours.  By removing the opponents cards in the middle of a battle, you can very frequently surprise him, and cause him to lose much needed power, forfeit, and a destiny draw, thereby causing his power/forfeit to drop to a critically low point against your power.  Let's view an example.<br>
<br>
    In a recent tournament, I was facing a pretty massive force.  My opponent had down at one site Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi's saber, Harc Seff, Melas, and Red Leader (with insurrection).	He had a power of 11 + a whopping forfeit of 27!  And Obi's saber + a destiny draw means I'd be losing probably two characters, as it was an indoor site.  Well, I came down on him and when the smoke cleared he had lost everyone but Obi-wan, plus about 10 additional force and I had lost no one.  Here's what I did, I removed three of his characters from the battle.  I deployed Choke Vader (DLOTS) + Vader's saber + Tarkin + Dr. Evazan.  Ok first, You are Beaten on Obi, so he and his stick are out.  Choke Red Leader, he's lost.	Hit Melas then operate on him, he's gone too.	All that's left is Harc and his lowly power of two/no destiny draw against 11+a draw.	As you can see, pretty nasty stuff.   I prefer removal to the previously stated methods for these two reasons: One is you are not only taking out power but even more importantly FORFEIT.  That's very important in these days of high forfeiting characters + Imperial Arrest Order/Insurrection.  Also, you are removing his destiny draw, further reducing power in an age when the destinies seem to be getting higher and higher, plus you save yourself from the attrition.  So let's look in detail at just a few good cards to use.<br>
<br>
   First characters.  The Dark side definitely has the advantage here.	The premiere characters for this are Choke Vader, Dr Evazan and IG-88.	 Characters are nice as opposed to interrupts, because first, game text is generally very hard to cancel, and two, characters stick around.  Choke Vader, probably the best character in the game, removes opponents through choking them.  Dr Evazan requires weapons on his behalf, but combined with lightsabers his removal potential is even better than Vader's.  The new version of IG-88 can actually capture characters in the middle of a battle with his riot gun, and with a +1 it should be easy to take out the supporting characters.	Also, another good character is J'quille who can exclude many characters including Operatives and Chewbacca.	On the light side, Wicket can exclude characters, and while he CERTAINLY doesn't belong in every deck, Ive had him take my Vader out of a battle before.  The best, however, is Obi-wan.  Using his ability of causing a character of ability=1 to move away is not exactly choking, but there are times when it can really swing a battle.  NEW INFO: Master Luke.  You can send aliens back to opponents hand with a destiny draw.  Whew this is rough.  I think the LS finally got a great removal character, with so many bounty hunters floating around.	I suspect this will be a character to be concerned with.<br>
<br>
    Let's move on to weapons next, strangely, very important to battle removal, then we'll finish up with interrupts.  As you can see from the character list and will further see later, weapons are very important to removal.  Weapons, generally, are disliked in Swccg because it takes another card, and when a character is lost you also lose the weapon.  However, with the enhanced packs there are many characters who come packed with a weapon.	This makes it easy to play interrupts that require this.  We'll hit this again in a few minutes.  Ok, first an underrated weapon that is on both sides.  Disruptor Pistols.  In high destiny decks, I prefer these to lightsabers because of the fact that the opponent is lost.  TECH: In a high destiny Dagobah deck, combine Yoxgit with Disruptor pistols.  He can sit over on Dagobah where hes safe from battle and Bubo (Yodas text) and get these things back as needed (his game text is NOT retrieval),  plus they are a destiny of 4.  Another surprisingly useful card is X-wing Laser cannons and SFS Laser Cannons.  On the surface, they look useless.	But, when you can spend three force to disintegrate a Leader card, a fully loaded Falcon, or a Bounty Hunter ship, and leave some poor destiny drawless chump against your huge fleet, they are pretty good.   Finally, back to the goofy ewoks, ewok spears are not laughable.  It is very easy to exclude DS characters, even Vader or Tarkin.  Of course, these are 100% useless outside of an Ewok deck, and one can really question the worth of playing ewoks in exchange for the use of the spears, but... Fore warned is fore armed in case you ever see one.<br>
<br>
    Lastly, let's move to red cards.  This is where a lot of removal can take place for both sides.  One thing to be wary of when planning a strategy around any red card is Sense and Alter.	So if you are going to use this kind of removal, take the appropriate precautions.  Let's start with the best You are Beaten and Clash of Sabers.  Note: Clash's effectivess has been severely limited due to Crush the Rebellion.  Anyway, all you need is a character with a lightsaber, not very hard with Enhanced Luke, Obi, or Vader.  Spend 2 force and you can exclude ANY character you are present with no matter how powerful.  This can be one of the most devastating cards in the game, as you can remove the best character and leave a weak fool to beat up on.  A card to be feared.  Another absolutely deadly and versatile card is the incredible Sniper and Sorry about the Mess from ANH.  Mess Vader, and frequently it'll be Tarkin against all your mains.	Ugly, real ugly.  Also, these offer good protection against spies and other annoying characters.  Very similarly, I've seen people playing with Stay Sharp lately as well.  While harder to setup, it is used and gets better bonuses.  TECH: The key is landing claw.  All you really have to do is get Han on the falcon with a claw and wait.  It is very, very difficult to get away from a clawed ship, they are the ULTIMATE space snipers.  I consider this to be much better than Hit and Run.  On the DS, Trample is nearly identical, but uses the more useful walkers rather than weapons.	Under Attack is a nasty used vehicle sniper.  Furthermore, Dueling can take the extremely powerful Obi-wan or Luke right out of a battle, as well as cause the opponent to lose force.	Another card Ive been looking into is Dark Strike and Blaster Proficiency.  By losing a force, you can cause a hit character to be lost immediately, basically an interrupt version of Dr. Evazan.  Plus, BP can help increase your chances of hitting a tough character with one of those wonderful enhanced forfeit=0 weapons.  Finally, while they are not exactly technically removal, cards that make things power=0 often serve the same function.  These include Glancing Blow, Power Pivot, and one of the most powerful cards in the game: Lateral Damage.  I'd give a nod to it here just for it's incredible raw power.  It is, to paraphrase Clint Hayes, a game changing card.<br>
<br>
    So what's the best defense against all this?  You are probably paranoid at this point about putting down Obi and a Rebel Trooper (as you should be) so what can you do about it?  The best defense Ive found against most removal are enclosed vehicles.  They really protect your characters from so many things, and they usually can react.  Vehicles can stop nearly any weapons, snipers, dueling, forfeit=0, you are beaten, choking, operating, lost in the wilderness, you name it.  They can be very useful.  The best are Tempest 1, Blizzard 2, Snow/Sand speeders, and cloud cars.  Look into these they can save you from many nasty surprises.<br>
<br>
    Well, that's it for now, even though I've just barely dug into this amazing way of stripping out the opponent's power, forfeit and destiny draws.  I haven't even touched Bubo, In Range, High Speed Tactics, Set for Stun, etc, etc.  Hopefully, now that you've read about it, you'll be coming up with your own devious ways to fool you opponent and give him a beating he wont soon forget.  Remember, just when your opponent thinks he's safe, that's when you let him have it.  Thank you.<br>
