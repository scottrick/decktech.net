I just don&#146;t enough time right now.  Enjoy!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The new card, Either Way, You Win is incredible.  What other card allows you to retrieve 3 force just by playing a card?  None!  Granted, it lets the opponent retrieve 1 card, but that&#146;s a small price to pay.  This card is even better when the opponent is not playing Something Special Planned For Them.  You play one at the end of your turn, and one at the beginning of their turn.  You retrieve the previous card and a total of 6 force.  For just playing cards.  It gets you your necessary cards back at critical times.  Just play it when the opponent just lost something not important, like from his hand.  I know I&#146;ll use lots of them.  And, it&#146;s uncommon!<br>
<br>
Changing The Odds is another new Tatooine card that is super-duper.  Let&#146;s say they look their reserve deck for any reason, and they don&#146;t find anything.  Verify them and just rip apart their necessary interrupts and ultra-high destinies.  Wow.  And, it&#146;s common!!  And, it&#146;s a USED interrupt with 5 destiny.  I love it.<br>
<br>
Eventually You&#146;ll Lose.  This card is the bane of swarm decks everywhere.  Oh look they have Well Guarded Out.  That&#146;s too bad.  It doesn&#146;t counter this card.  The best way here is play Perimeter Scan to see what he has.  He has 3 TIE Interceptors?  That&#146;s too bad.  Which brings me to...<br>
<br>
Perimeter Scan.  Why doesn&#146;t anyone use it?  I remember when Scanning Crew was big, but counters started showing up.  This card is basically Scanning Crew that is a little less limited on the card-putting-down basis.  However, it&#146;s a 4 destiny that looks through their hand.  That&#146;s incredible.  And it doesn&#146;t even have a counter against it except sense, and who uses SAC anymore?  Exactly.<br>
<br>
Logistical Delay/Restricted Deployment are 2 excellent cards against any deck.  For one, their warriors (let&#146;s see, Tarkin, Vader, Dengar, Iggy, Guri, Xizor... etc etc etc etc) are all deploy +1.  Combined with Goo Nee Tay, that&#146;s 3 extra deploy per beefy character!  That&#146;s insane!  And Logistical Delay, while more limited, is almost as useful.  There are so many SYCFA swarm decks out there now that this card it highly useful.  If you control Wakeelmui, they are all deploy +3!  That&#146;s insane!<br>
<br>
Polarized Negative Power Coupling makes used piles go face-up.  This alone isn&#146;t too bad for them, however, you put in a few copies of Visored Vision and they&#146;re totally screwed!  If they&#146;re using the force, make sure you see what the cards are.  Then smack them down for massive losses!<br>
<br>
SW-4 Ion Cannon.  I used to love this card.  Now, with B-Wings, I love them even more.  Let&#146;s see, that&#146;s +2 to hit them.  Dreadnaughts, Chimaera, and all star destroyers are easy to hit with a simple tracked/electrobinoculared destiny.  Then shoot them with a proton torpedo, or whatever you want.  Intruder Missle maybe.  You decide.  :)<br>
<br>
All My Urchins makes opponent lose 2 force to initiate battle at same location.  And it&#146;s movable.  Combined with Order To Engage, this could be one hell of a combo.<br>
<br>
Dismantle On Sight.  Deploy on a droid, and watch them run around, spreading their forces thin trying to keep him alive as you deploy your Qui-Gon and smash him into pieces.  Works on 4-LOM, Guri, and especially IG-88 which are all popular.<br>
<br>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  is king vs BHBM decks.  If Luke is about to be crossed to the dark side, he is lost instead.  Oh look, he&#146;s gone!  He&#146;s not crossed!  That means no winning for you!<br>
<br>
Rebel Leadership is almost exactly like Imperial Command, except you can&#146;t look for Generals/Admirals.  HOWEVER, Strike Planning does that for you.  So, you immediately have Crix and Solo out to use this card on.  Add a destiny to almost every battle?  Kick @ss!<br>
<br>
Yoda Stew/You Do Have Your Moments is such a cool card, that&#146;s why they made it a combo!  Let&#146;s say the dark side tracked an excellent destiny to knock off your Ben, Luke, whatever.  Now, before anyone is forfeited, just make both players&#146; attrition =0.  Now, you have a turn to build up your characters and retaliate.  Also, use Yoda Stew to get yourself some force when the opponent least expects it.<br>
<br>
R-3PO.  I know some people use it, but not enough!  This card is the killer of ISB.  And TIE swarms.  They deploy a spy/undercover spy to your site, you deploy this guy and eat him away.  It&#146;s direct damage punishment if the opponent plays smart.<br>
<br>
Affect Mind is pure tech.  Let&#146;s say you have Luke, JK flyin&#146; around in his ship with Threeanspi there.  That makes them need to have 7 ability there.  Now, you deploy this on him.  This makes them total ability -2, effectively making them need 9 whopping ability just to draw battle destiny!  HOLY SHIIT!!!<br>
<br>
Solo Han goes great in all scout decks.  You got Chewie and Han there, and they deploy DVDLOTS.  OH CRAP!  they choke chewie, and you can&#146;t draw destiny.  Oh wait, you play this and draw 2 destiny and kill off his Vader!  Now, play OOC and make him placed out of play (this same strategy works with all of the &#146;alone&#146; cards).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope some of this helped.  I love all these cards and play with them often.  It&#146;s surprising, there are almost no counters, and they&#146;re sweet cards.  You&#146;ll win a lot with these cards, guarenteed.  I can think of more, I might expand this article later.  SWCCG 4ever.<br>
