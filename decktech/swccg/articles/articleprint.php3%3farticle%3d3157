Light side, used interrupt and destiny 5,<br>
Text, Cancel a battle just initiated at a site where any rebel of ability more than 2 is present, by moving all your characters there away (at normal use of the force).<br>
<br>
I`ve seen hardly anyone play this card, I think it`s brilliant in most decks where there are rebels. If you`ve got some force and a rebel and the dark side come down with a big powerful bunch of characters, you can play narrow escape and move to an adjacent site. If the dark side used all there force putting characters down they won`t have the force to move to where you are. Next turn you will be able to force drain and if it`s a big force drain it is much better for you and bad for them. Another big thing about this card is the destiny 5, everybody likes high destiny and it pays off for stuff like battle destiny, weapon destiny and for targeting characters and for podracing if you play it. With traffic control or thrown back you can recycle it and if you play surprise assault it does big damage and even when you do play it goes to the used pile. An all round very powerful and very good card and can go in most decks that are popular today like light side combat.<br>
<br>
Stormtrooper Utility Belt<br>
Dark side, device and destiny 4,<br>
Text, Use 1 force to deploy on any imperial or alien. Character`s power and forfeit are +1. If on death star, power and forfeit +2.<br>
<br>
In some ways a very powerful card. You need to play it with stormtroopers, best way is to play a beatdown deck with stormtroopers, unique ones, then they are power 2, put a utility belt on one or two of them, whatever you`ve got, makes them power 3, start a battle then play trooper assault to make them power +2, therefore making the ones with the utility belt power 5, and if you deployed a Vader, play dark jedi presence to make them power 10 each which crushes most light side force and doesn`t cost too much. Stormtrooper utility belt is a very powerful card if combined with other cards can make a huge beatdown nearly unstoppable. You can start with the effect from endor that gives stromtrooper armour so they don`t get shot easily, in today`s gameplay you can fit it into any stormtrooper beatdown decks that are around.<br>
<br>
Beru Stew<br>
Light side, lost interrupt and destiny 4<br>
Text, each player must immediately activate 2 force. Also, you may activate 1 additional force for each Beru Lars, Owen Lars or Hydroponics Station on table.<br>
<br>
Another very powerful light side card, gives you the chance to get more activation just by using an interrupt. It doesn`t have to be during a battle, whenever you want. It`s most best used when playing a tatooine mains deck with loads of harvests. You get Beru Lars and Owen Lars already on table giving you more activation. That lets you get the chance to play cards like rebel barrier or clash of sabers, interrupts that cost force, if you`ve already spent it on your characters etc. It makes the battle much more easier for you and could cause the opponent much damage. The destiny 4 is quite good, not brilliant but not bad either. It also plays better on a tatooine draining deck with vaporators and hydroponics station letting you activate even more force for characters or them very important interrupts for battle. And all round brilliant interrupt, I`ve seen nobody use it where I am except for me. <br>
<br>
Radar Scanner<br>
Light side interrupt, used interrupt and destiny 3<br>
Text, if you have at least one vehicle or starship on table, use 1 force to glance at the cards in the opponent`s hand for 10 seconds. You may move each Jawa (except Datcha) and tusken raider you find there in the opponent`s used pile.<br>
<br>
Another very powerful light side interrupt letting you know what`s in the opponent`s hand as long as you`ve got a starship or vehicle on table. The power of the card to know what your opponent is going to do, what interrupts he/she might have. This is good if you are playing beatdown deck, because you know what the opponent`s got and if it stops you completely or hurts or just doesn`t have anything and you be fine for that beatdown. You just have to put a useless vehicle down or if your playing space anyway your be alright. The second part to it is useless really. Another good thing is that it`s a used interrupt so it just goes back when you`ve played it so you`ll be able to look at opponent`s hand again and again. It`s better if your playing with senses or alters or sense and alter protection so it doesn`t get cancelled and this interrupt fits into today`s gameplay.<br>
<br>
Old Ben<br>
Light side interrupt, lost interrupt and destiny 3<br>
Text, Use 1 force if any of your characters (except Obi Wan) was just forfeited from a tatooine site. Mysterious &amp;#8220;crazy wizard&amp;#8221; steps in and revives (re deploy for free) that character back to same site.<br>
<br>
Yet again another very powerful light side interrupt. Obviously you can only play it if you playing on tatooine or if your opponent is playing on tatooine. Very good with Watch your step, if you just lost Luke Skywalker Jedi knight you can re deploy him for free giving you that power back and a very vital card. Also very important with a tatooine draining deck with vaporators. If you just lost Ardon Vapor Crell, an important bit to your deck you can get him back and put other characters down next turn to battle the opponent or for backup, or just move away. <br>
Best played with, Watch your step, Hyperdrive or the tatooine draining deck. It can be so powerful. I`ve seem one player play with it with hyperdrive reviving qui gonn which was very important after that turn because he drained at the junkyard and got a card for credits will do fine, and can be used into today`s gameplay.<br>
<br>
Don`t underestimate our chances<br>
Light Side interrupt, lost interrupt and destiny 4<br>
Text, If an opponent has just initiated a battle, triple the resulting battle damage for the eventual loser. Or Triple the result of You Overestimate Their Chances.<br>
<br>
A very powerful light side interrupt. If you`ve got people that add battle destiny or cards that let you, this card is best with that, because if they think they`ve got more power which they will, you play a high destiny deck and add battle destinys and play this card when the battle is initiated and whatever battle damage it gets tripled. Say you got high destiny for your battle destiny and they lose by 5 for example, it gets tripled to 15! In it`s own way this card can be a menace, and can be used in today`s gameplay.<br>
<br>
Hydroponics Station<br>
Light side, device and destiny 4<br>
Text, Use 1 force to deploy on any exterior tatooine site. Cannot be moved. When activating force, the card may be drawn directly into your hand. If a vaporator is on table, the second card may also be drawn directly into your hand.<br>
<br>
Use this when playing a tatooine deck. Always useful in a watch your step, hyperdrive or just a tatooine draining deck. If you play ardon vapor crell on tatooine your force drains are more where you have a hydroponics station and play underground contacts from Jabba`s palace sealed deck so your force drains can`t be cancelled. The Text is brilliant as well. It`s drawing cards at the beginning of the activation phase which could get you your important characters or interrupts you need, for battling or something. Or you could get something that enhances you force drains next turn leading to big damage for your opponent. Use in combination with a vaporator you get two cards when you activate and with Ardon Vapor Crell you get even more force drains. A very powerful device for the lightside that can be used in today`s gameplay.<br>
