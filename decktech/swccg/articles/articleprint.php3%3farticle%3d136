Why do people post unhelpful stuff and what can be done about it?</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Article</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">There is an acronym used by logicians in solving formal logic problems: QED. It stands for the Latin phrase Quod Est Demonstratum  It is proved.  Logicians place this acronym at the end of each formal proof.  Often, in the (supposed) interest of brevity, the logician will skip the obvious final steps in the proof and go right to the conclusion and QED. However, this can wind up turning into an academic headgame with a logician skipping as many steps as possible in order to show that a long series of complicated proofs are obvious to him/her and, therefore, need not be shown. Of course anyone reading the proof feels like a fool if s/he doesnt see how the last proof listed obviously leads to the conclusion; and s/he may be too intimidated to question the author of the proof. Of course there is a flip side: if the obvious steps turn out to be invalid, the logicians reputation will be damaged. So, what makes good sense as a form of shorthand among academics of equal talents and good will, can turn into a mean spirited contest. Each logician trying to demonstrate his/her own brainpower by claiming that very complicated proofs are obvious and do not need to be spelled out.<br>
<br>
I have noticed a similar phenomenon here on Decktech. Decks are posted with little or no explanation or even something obviously calculated to intimidate like:<br>
If you cant understand why my deck is the best deck on Gods green Earth and you cant see exactly how to use it to beat every deck type known to man, then you are a worthless human being and I am surprised that you have the brainpower to power up your computer much less count to five which is the number of stars it will get from anyone with an IQ over 69 (uh ... he said 69).<br>
A lesser form of this is the popular: This deck takes a lot of skill to play.<br>
This basically translates into	I know how to win with this deck because I am a good player. If you lose with it, its because you are not as good a player as I am.<br>
<br>
The idea is simple, keep people from rating your decks poorly by intimidation. Make them ask themselves How can I, a mere mortal, presume to rate the deck of the great &lt;insert name of highly rated/world finalist player here&gt;? I have even seen reviews with comments similar to: if &lt; highly rated/world finalist player&gt; made this deck, it must be great.  Even some of the better players and reviewers seem to have a professional courtesy review policy. If I were to post certain deck, they might review it fairly and give it 3 stars or 3 and  stars. If  &lt; highly rated/world finalist player&gt; posts the same deck s/he gets 4 to 4 and  stars.<br>
<br>
Now all this is understandable. We are all game players here and game players are competitive by nature. Its not always intentional. You show a game player anything that looks like a game and s/he wants to win.  Anytime you introduce a rating system into anything you have created a game. So Decktech has become a kind of game or series of games.<br>
<br>
The overall highest member rating game<br>
The deck of the month rating game<br>
The, ever popular, lowest member rating game<br>
<br>
The problem is that we lose sight of the real game -- SWCCG. I do not participate in this site in order to prove that I am a better player than anyone else. I participate in order to BECOME a better player than anyone else	or at least the best player I can become in my circumstances.  I also want to help other players improve, if I can. Decktech is a data share. We give of our own talent and experience in order to benefit from the talent and experience of others. At the same time, I am a game player and I want to win every game I play, including the Decktech rating game.<br>
<br>
So, in a sense, we are focussing on the wrong thing with the rating system. If we come here to help and be helped, then perhaps we should be rated on how well we help.  Sure, rate the decks. A good deck is usually more helpful than a bad deck.  But also rate helpfulness of comments and ratings somehow.  This will encourage reviewers to add value, not just shoot things down or pump them up. I dont know how easy something like this would be to implement and Im sure there is potential for abuse. But I think it might also encourage people to compete to be the most helpful in order to boost their ratings. Give an award for the most constructive deck reviewer of the month or something. I know that I often get more value reading the review comments about someones deck than I get by just looking at the deck. Let me review the comments.<br>
<br>
Right now I see  star ratings with comments like easy three for me. This doesnt help anyone but the reviewer. If the reviewer thought s/he might actually lose points by putting something unhelpful or not well thought out, s/he might think twice before joining the vultures in picking at the carcass of a bad deck or by carelessly knocking a deck s/he hasnt reviewed carefully.  This will also make the toadies think twice before they write suck-up reviews of their buddies (or their own under a different handle) decks.<br>
<br>
Now, as you think about how to rate this article, you will ask yourself:  Does this affect my overall strategy and deal with larger aspects of the game? Can I give this article 5 stars in good conscience?<br>
Well yes you can and heres why:<br>
<br>
Decktech deals with many of the larger aspects of the game.<br>
<br>
The quality of the decks and deck reviews on Decktech affect my overall strategy by giving me a wider universe of possibility.<br>
<br>
This article will influence how decks are reviewed and how helpful the comments are.<br>
<br>
If the reviews of decks on Decktech are more helpful, the quality of the decks posted will improve.<br>
<br>
If the decks improve in quality, then the universe of possibilities will improve.<br>
<br>
If my universe of possibilities improves then my understanding of the larger aspects of the game will improve and my strategy will improve.<br>
<br>
Therefore I should give this article 5 stars.  QED<br>
<br>
Not intimidated? Rate it any way you like...<br>
