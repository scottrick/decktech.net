I have recently looked at the report for the new game, and I read all the responses to it.  I must admit, I&#146;m not that impressed with the game so far.  But that brings me to this article.  Why is it that everyone is bashing the new game?  It&#146;s too simple...It&#146;s for kids...All you do is battle....It&#146;s got dice...It&#146;s stupid.....It&#146;s a waste of time and money.... Do these all sound right?  I know I&#146;ve used a few of them too.  I&#146;m here to try and clear up a few things for everyone reguarding the new game.  Yes it&#146;s a WoTC product and IMO, that&#146;s bad ;o)  But let&#146;s compare the two games at the times of release.  Can anyone remember back when Premier was the only set?  Can you remember trying to build decks and play them?  I do and I must be honest, it was a boring game then.  It&#146;s not like the game we have today with all the spec. cards and themes that we have now.  To build a deck back then was to truely put 60 cards together and battle.  Yes, the game was all about battles at first, just like this new game looks like now.  The set had 300+ cards to start with us not having a Chewie or a R2 at first (came out in ANH) but we had the non-unique ships for both sides and a decent amount of characters to play on the ground with.  It was hard to build a single planet ground deck since we didn&#146;t have all the sites out yet either.<br>
  The new game is going to be 180 card set at first with 90 card expansion sets afterwords, which to a collector, is great!! This means less money invested to complete a set.  This is a key (IMO) since with TCGs/CCGs the sets are broken down in thirds. 1/3rd rare, 1/3rd UC, and 1/3rd Common that&#146;s only 30/60 rares(potential packs opened) needed to build a set.  Compared to the 100+ rares that just the first set gave us in CCG.  <br>
  Play-  This one will be tough to argue with.  CCG has one of the best game play styles to date.  hands down!!  But we have grown to this point with the new sets.  Objectives came in around SE, Ad Orders in DSII, Starting effects, starting interrupts, all the things that are part of any good CCG deck came into play much later in the sets.  Do I know if the new game will give us such advanced strategy? No I don&#146;t but I do know that the window is open.  They could add new things as the game gets older just like CCG did.  Who knows what the future will bring.<br>
  Pricing-  From what I have read so far, the pricing will be in various pack sizes.  As a CCG collector first, player second, the pack prices and size has always been a problem to me.  with a set being split into 3rds (as mentioned above) I did not like the fact that I have a billion commons that I can&#146;t even give away.  I do like the ratio factor, but my ideal pack has always been for a 6-7 card pack.  1 rare 2 UCs and 3 commons.  We would still have the same ratio of rares to commons but as collectors, we wouldn&#146;t have sooooo much extra stock and the company would not have to waste so much ink and paper to print all those extra commons either.  Which in turn would save them money, and hopefully funnel down to us is the form of cheapier products.  This new game has trageted such a cheaper pack in the $2 range (this is most likely to traget the kiddies and the weekly allowance they get--smart move WoTC)  I didn&#146;t like (this is not verified) the idea that a rare will be in something like every third pack.  I don&#146;t like the idea of getting a pack and getting nothing out of it that I could either trade or use.<br>
  These are just a few examples of the two games side by side for the first set.  If you think back (the players that have been around that long) and remember those early decks we all had, you will see alot of the same issues.  And to all those other players out there that have joined this great game called CCG, you&#146;re lucky to have as tight of a game play system to play.  But it took us 5+ yrs to get here!!  <br>
  To sum this all up, I&#146;m just asking from everyone to be alittle more open about the new game.  As a SW fan first, and a colletor/player fan second, I will give this new game a chance.  Lucas has me pegged from the get go. Put a SW logo on a product, and I&#146;m a sucker for the bait.  I&#146;ll take a look at it.  But to always get online and read bytch after bytch about this game sucks, this has killed SW, this game &#146;blows&#146; this game......blah blah blah.....These are comments from the upset (and I don&#146;t blame you.  Lucas-Decipher-WoTC have killed the CCG) Be upset, express those feelings, but express them to the right people.  And honestly, this board is the wrong people.  Use the board to organize your&#146;voice&#146; but use the voice in the correct forum.  Take the battle to Lucas, afterall, it was thier choice for the change in the long run correct?This childish comments are also from the uninformed too.  They are the ponys with the blinds up.  Open your eyes, explore the net. Get the details.  If you don&#146;t like the game why not?  What about the game don&#146;t you like. &#146; the dice&#146; well, what about the dice don&#146;t you like.....Details, Details, Details.  I don&#146;t like the dice idea either, but it&#146;s a new twist.  It&#146;s gonna take away the &#146;tracking&#146; ways of the old dogs, it seems pretty cut and dry. We have a target number and either we &#146;hit&#146; or &#146;miss&#146; so on paper, it seems simple enough.  I don&#146;t like the dice cause I think the random factor isn&#146;t good for the game.  Like in most games I play, there is a skill level involved. But where is the skill in rolling a die?  I am one of those &#146;trackers&#146; in the CCG and that is a skill level we have all developed over the years.  It will be very tough for me to accept that change for sure.  <br>
I just would like to have everyone give the game a chance.  If you don&#146;t want to get into another game, great!!  All the power to you, but to use this board or any other net window, or even in a local shop talk, to influence others with your misinformed, basis opinion on the subject just is plain not fair!  Keep those feelings strong, but settle down, think before you rant.  You will find that you will come across with more credibility that if you just say &#146;this blows&#146; </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
