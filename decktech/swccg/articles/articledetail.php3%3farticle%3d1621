The persona of Ozymandias and the things he says and does reflect a side of his creator's personality allowed to run wild. He is the Dark side of the real live person who I know as Andrew Marchand.<br>
  This chapter is meant in no way as either an apology or an indictment of Andrew. In truth I think that overall he is a nice person. At the recent 2000 Dagobah Regional, Andrew stopped by for a while and visited, checking out the decks and saying hi to friends who were playing and I got a sense of nostalgia from him, he was not playing that day and I kind of think he wished he was. In person Andrew had always been pleasant and even respectful of me as a person and as a TD. It's a lot like Clint Hayes, in many ways I think Ozy was a prototype for Clint's online behavior. Except Ozy had a wry intelligence, where Clint just has profanity and arrogance. Ozy actually made me laugh a few times, he was a worthy adversary.<br>
    I guess the conception of Ozymandias began right around the release of the Dagobah expansion of the Star Wars CCG. It's a longo tello........<br>
  Up until this time the game was very squarely in the hands of the die hard fans. This was before the Special Edition's remember,  and those of us who were playing were for the most part Star Wars fans first and foremost. Collecting and playing the game cards was an adjunct to other Star Wars related fandom.<br>
  The game up to this time had a certain ethic that was a natural outgrowth of this fan base, most players were interested primarily in recreating key scenes from the movie or creating newer wackier ones. I should point out that I was one of those people and I still am, they call us Old Schoolers now but back then we were the only game in town. We  had no idea what was about to happen to the game.<br>
  April 1997 saw the release of the Dagobah expansion and remember  this was the exact same time that the Special Editions of the classic trilogy hit the theaters. Star Wars was on everyone's radar screen all of a sudden. I know I'm not the only TD out there who saw a huge influx of new players, many of them switching over from Magic the Gathering. Not only was Star Wars hot stuff but Decipher was blowing the	Weinies of the Coast off the map with incredible tournament support including card product and the incredible Star Wars CCG T-Shirts which totally kicked ass. At first it was very exciting to be luring WOTCs customers away, but little did we know that what was really happening was that the wolves were moving in amongst us sheep.<br>
  The first inkling I had of the change in the game came to me from my friend and future brother in law Michael Porter. On one of our play nights he mentioned that he had noticed these new Dagobah Cards that he thought could cause some serious hurting if one was to build decks around them. You guessed it, the cards we the inserts 3720 to one and Never tell me the Odds. I took a look at the cards and then laughed it off.<br>
&quot;The only characters with destinies high enough to matter for this card are total GIMPS!&quot; I said, &quot;They'll get slaughtered by mains!&quot;.<br>
  Mike proved me wrong by building an Odds deck, the first I ever saw and quite possibly one of the first ones ever built. He brought it to play night and butchered us all like hogs in a very NOT FUN way. By placing his high destiny gimps out of reach and placing insert after insert he was able to hit for horrific damage every time that insert popped. Modified versions that also utilized Asteroid Sanctuary made for quick kills with almost no interaction.<br>
  These decks arrived on the scene in our area clasped in the hands of two players who would bedevil me for the next year or so and cause me no ends of trouble. Gary Eldridge and Andrew Marchand started coming to tournaments at the comic shop and absolutely crushed with their insert decks. I figured they would get tired pretty quick and move on. They didn't.<br>
  They came week after week and played the same insert decks week after week and week after week the players got really pissed off. Now as a TD I have to be impartial in rulings and that is something I have always been. But remember that I am also a volunteer and my reason for being there was my love of Star Wars. This game they were playing could just have easily been played with Uno cards, it had none of the spirit or the fun of the game we had played just a few months earlier.<br>
  And the effect on the atmosphere at tournament was dramatic. Days spent previously in good fellowship and friendly competition devolved into angry knots of  opposing viewpoints glaring at each other across the room. Gary and Andrew seemed to not care about this in the slightest. At one point I even asked Gary if he was aware of how the other players felt about this and he told me point blank, he did not care about the other players. It was all about winning and racking  up rating points.<br>
  Now once again I want to point out, I am supposed to be impartial. And when it comes to the rules that is something I have NEVER wavered from. But God Damn. To flatly state that your only interest in the game is to win, and to do it on the backs of kids, is something that makes me so sick and furious that I am sure and will be the first to admit that I could not hide my feelings about it. All I could think of was would Shawn Valdez have liked this game? Would he have come back week after week to get crushed by a couple of grownup gaming bullies who didn't care about anything but winning and a stupid number that means NOTHING but ego points really? Players began to stay away in droves. Turnouts dropped by 30-50 percent and what was left was not having a very good time.<br>
  It got adversarial. Gary became a sanctioned TD himself and before long was not only playing in tournaments but also ruling in his own games, bullying opponents (kids remember) into accepting his interpretations of rules. Thing came to a breaking point one Saturday when one kid had the cojones to call for a ruling from me over Gary's insistence. I can't remember exactly what the question was now but I do remember that I needed to check my rules documents on it to be sure. I said so and started for my bag on the other side of the shop. Gary holds up his own copy of the CRDs but I insisted on using my own. So I go across the room and get my documents and about 10 seconds later I find the relevant listing and make the call, which agreed with Gary's interpretation I might add. A little speed bump in the day, or so I thought.<br>
  What I did not know is that when I went to go get my documents Gary got pissed off, thinking I did not trust him or his documents. I guess I didn't really, but that's beside the point. So while I'm getting my documents Gary lets off with a pretty severe stream of invective directed at my back including several variations of the word Fuck. Not too bright since one of the kid's mom's was there waiting for her kid about 5 feet away when he did it. I guess she got an earful. She didn't say anything to me about it and the first I heard about it was about Tuesday when Jim Gruel, the owner of the comic shop, calls me at work about it. He tells me the Mom called him up and was pretty upset about it because she had been leaving her kid there thinking it was a safe place where she would not have to worry. She informed him that she would not be allowing her child to be in an environment like this.<br>
  So needless to say Jim is pretty pissed. This is a guy who has worked hard to make his store a nice place and he's opened his doors to me and the tournament scene because he feels it is a compliment to his store and quite frankly it's good for business. But angry parents and foul mouthed players are not what he wants out of his business. He's on the fence about even considering the tournament scene in his store.<br>
  He tells me &quot;This is how it's going to be. Gary Eldridge is banned from tournaments.&quot;<br>
   I tell him flat out, &quot;Jim as TD I'm not sure that I have that authority.&quot;<br>
   He says &quot;No problem, as store owner I do, that guy is not to cross the threshold of my store again. If you can't ban him from tournaments I can damn sure ban him from the store.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Fair enough&quot;  I say, &quot;what can I do to set your mind at ease about tournaments?&quot;<br>
  &quot;I would like it if I did not have to waste another minute on this particular problem for one &quot; He replies &quot;The rest will take care of itself in time.&quot;<br>
  So basically I can wait for Gary to show up and tell him he's banned from the store and have a big blowup in front of more kids, or I can call him up and nip it in the bud and keep that from happening in public. I call him up and let him know what Jim had to say about it and why and when all is said and done Gary is barred from the store.<br>
  Since that time Decipher has come up with policies about such things, but at the time we did not have a policy for disruptive players. Jim did me a great favor by laying down the law on his turf and on his terms.<br>
  So things settle down somewhat, Andrew is still coming to tournaments and he is quietly winning week after week with the inserts. He knows where the line is and he's not going to cross it like Gary did. Those rating points every week were too valuable, stay cool and keep getting them.<br>
  Then in 1998 Decipher announces the first big Shawn Valdez memorial tournament. It's a big splashy deal with a special shirt and everything. And I get an e-mail from Andrew Marchand telling me that Gary is sorry about what happened and was there anyway I could get Jim to let him come to the Shawn Valdez event. I tell him flat out No. I point out that the Shawn Valdez tournament is a very special and personal event to me and that Gary and his insert decks exemplified everything BAD about this game.  And I'm pretty sure I said something like, you're not much better messenger boy.<br>
  The thing that made me so angry was that what was relayed to me was a plea from the heart, that in the spirit of the event I should let bygones be bygones. But all it really was is a blatant, and rather clumsy, attempt to manipulate me into helping Gary win yet another shirt. And not just any shirt, but a shirt that would have Shawn's card on the front of it. That image, the wrongness of it,  made me sick<br>
  A bloody tide rose behind my eyes and all the anger and frustration swirled within me and like a fool I let just the tiniest little splash get through on the keyboard. I hit the send button and it felt good.<br>
  That was the spark. I can look back on it now and I know that. I can't help but feel responsible for some of what happened because I gave in to my own dark side when I did that. Anger is the dark side and I was angry at them for what they'd done to the game. I gave in to it and my anger came back to me a thousand fold in the form of Ozymandias.<br>
  So our cards were on table so to speak.<br>
  Andrew became a sanctioned TD soon thereafter, so now he and Gary could take turns racking up rating points at Gary's store out in Orange Park Florida.<br>
  Not long after the first of Ozymandias first attacks on me came. He had started up his own webpage called &quot;Star Wars for guys who like Star Wars&quot; (a paraphrasing of TBS network's Movies for Guys who like Movies) which at the time was hosted on AOL webspace. One of the very first features on the page was a cute little piece called &quot;Gold 4 must DIE&quot; which had a fake picture of me (it was actually Gold 44 Rob Silmser's body and a funny head with ponytails and googly eyes) and a long diatribe listing my various crimes against humanity which included having sex with animals if my memory serves.<br>
  One of my Squadron buddies pointed me at the page and at first I thought it was kind of silly and amusing but when I thought about the time that went into the picture and the text and then the HTML it was kind of creepy. Somebody complained to AOL about the page (I never did) and the next thing you know the entire shebang was shut down by AOL lock stock and barrel. Ozymandias moved it over to Geocities and continued on.<br>
  Ozymandias grew in prominence, both through the list serve and his webpage. He became a harsh critic of Decipher. I think he went after Decipher for several reasons. For one they were a faceless corporate entity, it's much easier and less personal than taking on a person. People have friends, companies just have employees and customers. I think there was also a Quixotic aspect to it, Ozy the hero tilting at windmills.<br>
  Over time he found his voice. He found the perfect blend of sarcasm and arrogance and he began to attract imitators and followers. Players at tournament would point me at his diatribes and I have to say that his style once established was consistent. Andrew was an intelligent person and Ozy fed off that. There was a lot of anger in the community, my own little tournament scene was just a microcosm reflecting the greater community. People had divided into camps and Ozymandias was the spokesmen for the Disciples of Cheese.<br>
  Somehow he managed to get some good contacts. Obviously there was someone close to the inner circle at Decipher that was disgruntled because Ozymandias of all people began to get intriguing tidbits of information about upcoming sets. He used them for all they were worth, generating God knows how many hits on his site.<br>
  The mistake he made at this point was he was still running tournaments at the same time. His attacks on Decipher while at the same time being a sanctioned TD were bad enough a conflict of interest, but when he started using their intellectual property against them he had crossed a line. Decipher had been watching him closely and the minute he stepped over that line they had what they needed shut him down.<br>
    So Decipher took action. They unceremoniously stripped Andrew Marchand of his TD status, made him remove the offending material under threat of legal action and he went absolutely bonkers. His previous barbs were nothing compared to the venom he hurled now.<br>
  Now on the outside he threw rocks at every window he could find. He walked a careful line on the listserv and his website, the threat of legal action from his last exploit had taught him caution. He danced right up to the line again and again and people loved it.<br>
  Despite the fact that he was throwing off clues about who his source was, they continued to parcel out info to him.  His next big go round with Decipher came not from info he had collected but the now infamous &quot;Playtest Listserve&quot; which was first published on another site and almost immediately removed.  Unfortunately Ozy managed to copy it before it vanished and he waved it like a flag in Decipher's face.<br>
  Now some could argue that these episodes might be interpreted as providing a valuable service to Decipher, showing that their security had leaks and helping them close the holes much like hackers for hire often expose weaknesses for software developers. But the reverse is true. It showed a weakness while offering no clues as to how to stop the bleeding. It was carefully calculated taunting with any helpful information excised. He was very clever.<br>
  In 1999 I was running a Young Jedi Tournament at a local Borders books and music and out of the corner of my eye I saw a familiar face. It was Andrew Marchand. As soon as I had started the next game he came over to me and said he had come up here to talk to me face to face and to ask if it would be okay if he came to the Shawn Valdez tournament. I was impressed, it was the kind of honesty and straightforwardness that I cannot help but respect and I told him sure. We shook hands and off he went.<br>
  He did come to the tournament, and in addition to playing nice and being a model sportsman, he also contributed some leftover prize support he had from his TD days. That's what makes it so hard to figure him out, he really can be a nice person and I think if things had gone different at a few places he could have been a positive force in the game.<br>
  I thought at that point Ozymandias had pretty much run his course. The website was collecting cobwebs and he'd disappeared from the listserv for the most part. But he had a few more rounds to fire off and he used Decktech to deliver them.<br>
  I can't recall what his first editorial was about but I do remember that is was well written and not really that bad. I found it interesting that while some of the other columnists had pictures of themselves up, Ozy was just a black silhouette. A shadow of Andrew.<br>
  It further reinforced my feeling that this was just a character he was playing. And the character saw his usefulness coming to an end. Ozy's final act was not his final post. It was really the second to last and it came in the form of what can only be described as a rant. It contained a series of personal attacks on the employees of Decipher. It was like he had gotten the personnel list and just gone down the line and attacked everyone on it. It was lewd and mean spirited and showed none of the finesse of previous salvos. Up till then he's used precision but this was the verbal equivalent of a 12 gauge shotgun blast.<br>
  Decipher legal swung into action and this post was removed in short order by the webmasters of Decktech. I think they realized at that point that they'd taken on something they could not entirely control and it could be dangerous to them personally.<br>
  Ozy had one more shot left in him but it was more whimper than a howl and it barely raised and eyebrow. He told a story about how he had made a deal with someone at Decipher that he would not release some advance info he had and in return they would give him a qualification into the 99 regional (since they had Qualifiers that year). It sounded unlikely and of little consequence even if it was true.<br>
  Nothing has really been heard from him since. He came to the Dagobah regional this year and walked around and visited with a few folks he knows and it looked like a last look around to me. But I could be wrong, you never know when he might come roaring back. I think it's unlikely, but he's suprised me so many times that I won't count him out. But he looked like a man at peace, looking forward to the birth of  his child and taking a last look at a battlefield of his past.<br>
  I see Ozymandias wannabes everywhere. Clint Hayes is a perfect example, but he's such a pale imitator. His obscenity laced arrogance is just annoying. He does not have the finesse or the wit that it takes to make you actually root for the bad guy. It takes so much more than attitude but he'll never learn that.<br>
  When I look back on the story of Andrew Marchand and Ozymandias, I can't help but wonder what could have been. I can't help but feel that I failed somehow, that the right word here or there might have made a hero instead of a villain. It's stupid to think that, I can't live everyone's life for them. I guess we'll never know, what's done is done. In a way when I railed against him I was railing against change in the game and I know now that change was inevitable.  It was the coming of Tech that I was fighting. Shortsightedness on my part. Tech is here to stay although I have to admit that Death Star 2s magic bullets make me very happy. If the one card counter to numbers had come out in Cloud City things might well have turned out a lot differently. Water under the bridge..........<br>
 All in all it wasn't so bad and I think that in some ways Ozy performed a service. I think it took a toll on him personally in it's own way. He sacrificed a part of himself but I think he managed to keep the real center of himself apart from Ozymandias. Ozymandias was a part of Andrew Marchand but he kept the two separate somehow and it looks to me like Andrew has come through it all quite well.<br>
  I wish him luck and success and many happy healthy babies to come. And I pray that Ozy is gone forever.<br>
 I may have just one chapter left in me, a wrap up of sorts. Thanks to those who have read and enjoyed this series. When I started I was not sure if such a thing would go over here, but I'm gratified to see that Decktech readers enjoy a sense of community and can accept more than just decks and strategy. The spirit of this great game lives on!<br>
