	It's late in the game and things are looking pretty good for your Throne Room Mains deck. You've got EPP Luke sitting at the Lower Corridor happily draining for 2 with a healthy 7 power. You've managed to overrun your opponents' Audience Chamber with EPP Han and, of course, EPP Leia. Finally, you've got EPP Obi sitting at the Carbonite Chamber to cap off your drains at 6 a turn. Things are looking good. Well, this is where they go terribly wrong. Your opponent begins a thrashing that you never saw coming...<br>
	First, they whip out Zuckess and 4-LOM, EJP, no doubt, to poor Luke's location. BAM! 4-LOM blasts Luke, killing the lightsaber. SMACK! They whip out 2 destinies. Luke plummets to his demise, while they chuck 4-LOM and leave Zuckess with a destiny at the Corridor. But that's not the end...<br>
	Now, the onslaught continues with EPP Fett and EJP IG-88 coming to the Audience Chamber. POW! IG-88 captures Leia, leaving Han alone, without a destiny, while Fett blasts Han knocking you to a 4 power, 0 forfeit, and again, no destiny. So Han dies, Leia's captured, Luke's dead, and poor Obi is about to get the worst of it...<br>
	Finally, they drop Darth Vader (and his stick) and Grandma Tarkin, and ol' Ben ain't got a snowballs chance in Hell of surviving to fight again, plus you suffer the humiliation of having to forfeit him for 0. Sure, you may take down Tarkin with your stick, but with all of your mains lost (or captured) and overwhelmed by the battle damage, it really doesn't matter.<br>
And all the while you've got a massive force pile, accumulated from all of your twix sites, among other things, just sitting there. Uselessly mocking you as it dissipates, along with your lead and a victory.<br>
So, &quot;What's the point to all of this?&quot; you ask. Simple. The fact of the matter is, without help, those EPP mains become very easy targets, no matter what your opponent is playing. But do not fret, for there are ways to protect your precious mains...<br>
First, you've got &quot;It's Not My Fault.&quot; This fixed Special Edition Interrupt could be one of the most underused cards. First, it's a Used interrupt with the popular 5 destiny, making it an easy card to circulate through your deck, while still having awesome text. For a small expenditure of force (free if on Han of Lando), you can make your EPPs immune to attrition, COMPLETELY immune. That's better than any single character can provide in their text (except for Yoda or the Emperor, but who's gonna send one of them into battle?). The main catch of this card is that the opponent has to initiate the battle, but you're still gonna be safe from those surprise attacks your opponent attempts.<br>
The next card that card be a great EPP protector is &quot;First Aid.&quot; Again a used interrupt, this one only has a 4 destiny, but that is still enough to kill of them pesky bounty hunters is drawn for a battle destiny. The text of this one will greatly assist in the last part of the above scenario by restoring poor Obi's forfeit and saving you from a killer amount of battle damage. This card has another useful function: lost a vehicle, starship, or character from hand to reduce your battle damage by 5. So just chuck that extra Falcon, maybe that Artoo you threw in there to give to Jabba as A Gift, or anything to make that beat down into a small loss. And, to top it all off, this function is immune to Sense!<br>
Third, and finally, you've got an older card I still think can be quite useful today, if not more than before. The card I'm talking about is &quot;Put That Down.&quot; Yet another Used interrupt, again with a 4 destiny (which I already said ain't bad). The first function on this puppy can be the difference between a win and a loss to a bounty hunting deck, and can be useful against an array of other decks, too. Simple use 3 force (with today's activation, that's small change) and you can cancel the targeting of any weapon being shot at you. So, no more running in fear of Mara Jade or Vader armed with their stick's, or no more text cancellations by 4-LOM, no more captures by IG-88, etc. And then there is the second function which can come in handy against a select group of decks. That function is to cancel Double Back or Res Luk Ra'auf. Not the most useful function, but you may be happy you have it sometime.<br>
So, all these cards can go a long way toward further fortifying you EPP mains, but they all have two catches. 1. They're unique, so you must use them selectively. 2. None of them (except for the second function of First Aid) are immune to Sense. The uniqueness factor there's really nothing to do about, but as for Sense, we must remember the &quot;Wise Advice&quot; we got that we must &quot;Do, or Do Not.&quot; And to put your mind at ease, both of these ARE immune to Alter. Plus, now with Death Star II, we can use &quot;Heading For The Medical Frigate&quot; (Used: Add 1 to your battle destiny just drawn. STARTING: Deploy up to 3 Effects if each of them deploys for free, is always immune to Alter and has &quot;deploy on table&quot; (or &quot;deploy on your side of table') in its game text. Place Interrupt in Lost Pile.) to deploy both of these plus one other Effect that deploys on table and is immune to Alter (ie. Ultimatum, Insurrection, ect.)<br>
<br>
Well, that does it for this article. I hope these tips will come in handy for some of you. This is my first article, so I would appreciate any input I can get. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
