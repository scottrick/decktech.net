This really makes him the best of both worlds, and a new Force (pun intended) to watch out for. To give you a better idea of who the man behind the title is, we have arranged this little interview. It was done in German and translated afterwards. Angelo is a pretty down-to-earth and all-around nice guy. Should anything reflect poorly on him here, it was probably lost in the translation and is my fault. Please excuse such mistakes, and have fun.<br />
<br />
CM: So, Angelo, first of all congratulations on your well deserved title of world champion. Many players, especially those from outside of Europe, may have never heard of you before last week, and might wonder who the heck you are and where you came from all of a sudden. You are living in Germany, but your name sounds straight out of a Sopranos Episode. Please let us know who you are, how long you have been playing SW CCG and how many tournament games you have approximately been in. Also, what was your ranking before and now?<br />
<br />
AC: Well, my name is Angelo Consoli, I am 23 years old and Italian (and proud of it), but I am living in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Before Worlds, I had a rating of 1990. Since I played 7-1 on second day, and also beat the Top 2 players (Brian Hunter and Johnny Chu) in the world, I guess that my rating will climb up to around 2100. I believe that have had about 200-300 tourney games so far. My friend Sascha Denis originally got me into SW. We played Magic at the time, but I did not have the cash to keep buying the good cards, so I gave away all my cards to him. He stopped himself a while after that, and came back with something new: SW! That was shortly before Special Edition was released. I was more of a Star Trek fan, and did not have any interest to play the game at first. Luckily this opinion has changed!!! My first deck was a Tusken Raider deck, which had to stand it’s ground against the Jawa deck from Sascha. I leave the rest to your imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: You are also friends with Bastian Winkelhaus, not the shabbiest players himself (this side of the globe and elsewhere). Bastian was the winner of Freedom Con, and with that last years world champ in my book. How many times do you guys play against each other, and who else belongs to your playing group? Is there anyone we can expect to rise to fame from your league next year? There is also the burning question on every-ones mind: Who is the better player, Bastian or you? <br />
<br />
AC: We are often playing at the Vier Winden (Four Winds) in Bochum, where the local SW and Lord of the Rings tourneys are held as well. If something big is coming up, I also drive to Bastians home to play some games there. Every once in a while, I am also playing with Martin Falke, who recently became more active in the game again. These two should be known to almost every halfway decent Wars player out there. I am also playing at least once a week against Kai Zenerino and Carsten Zirkler at our university (that is college to you guys). Unfortunately, these two are not playing in many tournaments, although they are really not that bad! Otherwise there are not many new players here, but whoever wants to play, could send me an email or come to one of our monthly tourneys in Bochum. Right now, Bastian is still a bit better then me, but not much anymore. He wins about 60% of the games we play.<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: You are going to submit your own tournament report here on Decktech soon, so I will not get into any details about the games. But maybe a little information about your decks? You have a mean Watto deck going on the Dark Side and used Quit Mining Colony for Light Side. Do you have any preferences for a side, or do you think that one is stronger than the other?<br />
<br />
AC: Well, the Watto deck is easier to play and drives the opponent nuts, but you have to be a real good player to get the best out of a QMC deck. I personally believe that QMC is the most flexible deck out there. It has the means to beat everything, and I mean everything! The one thing that separates good decks from not so good ones, in my opinion, is how they make use of the space they have at their resources. I have often seen decks, that used a lot of unnecessary cards, meaning cards that do not fit the deck or deck strategy. An example would be Draw Their Fire in QMC. It just does not belong there, since you are yourself playing characters that are supposed to remain on table. In the end, you would only lose force yourself. It is also important to find the right balance between ground and space. I usually prefer balanced decks myself, except for a few cases. It does not matter with which side I play, as long as I get to play at all! I cannot tell if there is currently a stronger side, but Watto was a damned strong DS deck at Worlds, and many people were not prepared for it. This could be a whole lot different at the next tournament, of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: We do not know each other that long or good, Angelo (it is getting better every day though, right?), but I was able to watch you a bit from the sidelines as you won the European Championship in Amsterdam and the Open at the Essen Spiel fair. One certainly could get the impression that you worked yourself up to the world title pretty focused. How did you see the odds of really winning worlds? I mean, even I had the feeling you were gonna make it somehow. How was it with you? And also, could you see any differences between Americans and Europeans (current politics aside, let us all be friends, okay)? How about within Europe? Is there play wise a difference between  Germany versus Italy par example?<br />
<br />
AC: It was definitely my goal to get into the Top 8. That was the goal, and everything else was a bonus. I assumed that Bastian would regain his world title, to be honest. I did not notice that many differences compared to the Americans, except that they all seemed to play Watch Your Step or Lightsaber Combat. Between Germans and Italians I cannot really say. I only played against an Italian once. That was two years ago against David Destefanis, who is now the number one player in Italy, and he actually beat me then :-(  <br />
<br />
<br />
CM: In Essen I had the honor to be clobbered big time by your Watto deck... twice! I was amazed with how confident you left Watto and his ratty pal Reegesk at two different sites, while calmly building up your Locations and Effects. Maybe I speak for the rest of us mere mortals, when I ask how much control you (and other top players of your level) really have in such a situation. How much is risk? Are you really aware of what the opponent can do with his force and what you can prevent at all times? Or do you actually risk an amount of X damage to increase the pressure during the first turns?<br />
<br />
AC: At the beginning, it is rather unlikely that the opponent will come for a visit. He has to build up his game as well as you do. I am also packing 3 x Barrier, Projective Telepathy, Tempest Scout 6, Ghhhk, 2 x Force Field and Bad Feeling Have I. Any and every one of these cards will help and you should have something in your hand at first turn or draw it then. After all, you can flip for only 1 Force (Watto deploys free and virtual Reegesk is pulled by the virtual Ket Maliss Effect), and are able to look through your deck, searching for Watto or a Docking Bay. So you know exactly what you will, and still have 4 cards to go. Should an opponent really decide to come to you early, the whole thing might backfire at him fast. That happened in my game against Brian Hunter. The deck has a lot of beat down potential.<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: Do you consider yourself an offensive or defensive player? Is it sometimes hard for you to change between these playing styles in a tournament?<br />
<br />
AC: It really depends on the deck. Watto is an offensive deck, while you have to play QMC defensively. But I usually don’t have a problem switching. Otherwise I never could have made it in the second round of the final confrontation against Greg Shaw. I already had won the first game with 19 Force. Then it was Greg his Hunt Down versus my QMC. I was in the defensive the whole game and was simply losing force and losing force. It was no question that I would lose but just how high I would lose. I had to do an infinite amount of decisions, which cost me several minutes sometimes. In the end, I managed to lose the second game with 18 Force, bringing my total differential to +1.<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: How long did you play your decks now? Were those the only two competitive decks for tournaments or did you have any last minute decisions? Do you consider the experience you get from playing your decks again more important than the possible surprise element? How often do you change your decks in general?<br />
<br />
AC: I have been playing QMC since the dawn of time. Watto, I started to play at the European Championship, and I immediately knew that this was what I would play at Worlds as well. There are certainly other good decks out there, like Senate or Dark Deal, but Watto is the most flexible deck to put pressure on the opponent in my opinion. The experience and element of surprise are both equally important. When you start playing a new deck, you always make mistakes, regardless how good you are. Everybody does. But when you are always playing the same deck your opponents are also likely to prepare for it. There are always a few cards I change from tourney to tourney. Sometimes I even go to a tournament to test a deck which I build the evening before, but often enough that does not work out like expected :-)   Bastian changes his decks more often, so that it is not possible to predict what he will play. <br />
<br />
<br />
CM: What are you gonna do in the future, Angelo? Now that you have reached the ultimate goal, will you grow a beard and move to an isolated hut in the desert? Or do you intend to keep on playing as long as it is fun? Although it might be necessary to change decks now, that everyone and their brother will re-build or prepare against them. <br />
<br />
AC: I already have the beard :- )~  and I will play as long as possible. The game is simply the best. It will not be necessary to change the decks right now, but as soon as a new virtual set will hit the net, I will probably have to. <br />
<br />
<br />
CM: How do you personally see the future of the SW CCG? Just go crazy for a second. Will we get the license back or will WotC buy the game mechanics from Decipher before we get to the virtual Coruscant Expansion? <br />
<br />
AC: I honestly cannot say. It is certainly my dream that Decipher will get the license back one day and will continue the game with Episode II and beyond. But since this is rather unlikely, one can just hope that the PC will continue to do such a great job, and that they will realise their plans concerning the Star Wars Pro Tours (in Europe as well).<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: Hey, I did not pay him to say the last part (The money is on the way, Angelo). I guess I am also at the end of my questions. You probably already revealed more about yourself then you ever wished to, but everybody will want to know, Buddy. It is a Wild Wild West out there. There will always be a Greenhorn trying to duel you from now on. Anyway, would you like to greet or thank anyone?<br />
<br />
AC: Of course, I would like to thank all those that made this possible. Decipher for the game itself and for the prize support, the PC for the splendid tourney, all the super nice opponents against whom I played, all my friends who attended D-con with me, and all my playtest partners. An extended props section will follow in my tournament report.<br />
<br />
<br />
CM: And since I did not win Worlds (and not even the last local tournament but that is another story), I only have you to thank. Next time, I will be with you at D-con to see you win. I doubt that we have heard the last from you. We will watch out for your TR on Decktech and maybe the PC will also write a detailed report about that very close final match of yours. So again, Angelo, thank you very much and congratulations. <br />
