I realize that people like to use MWYHL and HB with Mains and Toys, but I wanted to discuss more of an old-school approach to Mains and Toys in today's environment.  I'm an old-schooler at heart, and I have been using the same LS M+T deck since Special Edition with modifications over time, and it has won for me 90% of the time.	Besides, articles about objectives have been done already, and I haven't seen a good article on Mains and Toys w/o them.<br>
<br>
A Mains and Toys deck aims to control the game with sheer versatility whether it be battling, draining, or direct force loss.  Here are the different parts of a Non-Objective LS M+T deck.<br>
<br>
Locations:<br>
<br>
Well, in today's environment, there are basically 2 choices for starting locations.  One is the infamous Yavin 4 Throne Room using Careful Planning for the Swamp and the Farm, and the other (my personal favorite) is Obi's Hut and Careful Planning for either the Tosche Station or another Tatooine site to convert their site.	Either way, the key is activation.  Twix locations are key to a good Mains and Toys deck since activation is needed with all those high deploy costs.  The Rendezvous Point, Hoth Echo: War Room, and Dagobah Yoda's Hut are all great 2-0 locations since the opponent basically has little to no drain at these locations.  1 or 2 more 2-0's are useful as well despite the possibility of getting drained for an unhealthy amount.  These include the Yavin 4: Massasi HQ, War Room, and War Ruins along with Endor: Chirpa's Hut which is useful for its anti Endor Ops status.  Good draining locations are your choice.  You can either make them come to you by deploying to a good drain site like the Cloud City Carbonite Chamber or the Lower Corridor, or you can react to them through battling at their drain locations or 2-0's.<br>
<br>
Characters:<br>
<br>
Of course characters are the key part to a successful LS Mains and Toys deck.  However, choosing the right mains to use is key when constructing a deck.  I'll start with Obi-Wan Kenobi.  There are 3 versions of him and they're all useful in their own respect.  Ben Kenobi is a nightmare for the opponent with his 'revival' skill and dueling adder, but his deployment restriction to Tatooine is annoying at times since you have to rely on Nabrun Leids to get elsewhere.  Also, Ben is great for an Obi's Hut-Tosche Station start as you can get him to his Hut 1st turn possibly with saber to move over to the Tosche Station for a drain of 2 and 5 extra activation on the 2nd turn.  Obi-Wan Kenobi is good all-around with no deployment restrictions and his skill of moving away 1-ability characters is useful vs. Operatives, Skrillings, and numerous other characters.  And then there is EPP Obi.  He has a built in Saber which is awesome along with no deployment restrictions, but with no immunity to attrition like the other 2, you need Mantellian Savrip and/or Bacta Tank to protect him.  And then there is Luke.  In my mind, only 2 of the available Lukes are worth playing right now.  Master Luke is great on Tatooine especially with his Saber along with his 'bounce' ability, but he lacks overall when compared to EPP Luke.  A built in Saber with no restrictions is too much, and he becomes even better when with Ben or a Bacta Tank to recycle him.  Master Luke is still good, but EPP Luke is just better in the overall scheme of things.  Leia and Han are grouped together since they're very much alike.  We all know the power of EPP Han and EPP Leia and how effective they are.	With no deployment restrictions and good permanent weapons, these 2 are monsters.  Of course Capt. Han is great on the Falcon, and Boushh is a good UC spy, but for raw power, EPP Han and Leia are the right picks.  Chewbacca has often been lost in the shuffle, but he is still a powerhouse.  His ECC version has a blaster, but with no +1 to destiny, you'll have a tough time hitting people.	He also adds a destiny with Threepio which can be good, but in my mind Chewbacca is better for his lower deployment, higher forfeit, and ability to pilot all ships and not just the Falcon.  These are the 5 big mains, bit other characters are needed as well.  Orrimaarko and Tawss Khaa are 4 ability characters with great special abilities that are good for battling or holding down a site by themselves.  Melas and BoShek are good pilots to go against Zuckuss in Mist Hunter while spies like Jeroen Webb can help in canceling Visage of the Emperor or infiltrating DS twix sites.  The best 2-2 character out there is Wedge Antilles who has a great deploy to forfeit ratio of 2:6 and adds 3 to the power of anything he pilots, while Harc Seff can cancel numerous drains and is a pilot to boot.  Other characters are your choice, but these are a good start.<br>
<br>
Weapons:<br>
<br>
Well, Obi's Saber and Anakin's Saber are good if you're not playing the EPP Versions of them, but those are about the only 2 good weapons for a Mains and Toys deck.  I've seen Leia's and Chewie's weapons, but they're sub par compared to the EPP versions.<br>
<br>
Starships:<br>
<br>
There is some variety in the number of starships to include in a good Mains and Toys deck.  You could go with the 'Super Falcon' consisting of Capt. Han and EPP Leia on the Falcon, but that limits you on the ground.  Lando in Falcon seems like the better choice since you get the immunity to attrition and you don't have to sacrifice Han or Leia.  Tantive IV and the Spiral are good all-around ships which have room for 3 pilots each, while the Redemption/Bacta Tank combo is useful.	The Leader cards (Gold Leader in Gold 1 and Red Leader in Red 1) are good, but they're usefulness has waned with the Bounty Hunter ships outclassing them is usefulness although an automatic destiny draw shouldn't be counted out.	I prefer Gold Leader in Gold 1 since it's cheaper and can hold a pilot.<br>
<br>
Creatures:<br>
<br>
The only creatures you'll ever see in Mains and Toys are Nudjes (Nudjii?), and that's only for the popular Yavin 4 start to deny the opponent force.<br>
<br>
Vehicles:<br>
<br>
Rarely will you see vehicles in LS Mains and Toys, but 1 Sandspeeder or Swoop couldn't hurt for mobility.<br>
<br>
Interrupts:<br>
<br>
Interrupts are very important to the deck.  SAC is optional, but I highly recommend it as it gives you control over the game and limits the opponent's options.  Just beware Oppressive Enforcement and There is No Try.  Destiny adders are another option as well.  Popular ones include Gift of the Mentor which adds 2 destiny draws with Luke and Obi or Yoda (also grabs a Saber from reserve), Skywalkers which adds 2 destiny draws with Luke and Leia (also cancels Imperial Barrier), and I Know which adds 2 with Han and Leia (also deploys Leia free from Reserve to same location as Han is defending - Very useful for the Super Falcon).  Transmission Terminated is the Visage killer, but if you play numerous spies or feel ok with losing force from it as long as the opponent does, don't worry about it.  Clash of Sabers is still a game-breaking card, but Crush the Rebellion has limited its usefulness.  Nabrun Leids is almost a necessity nowadays, but a lot of people pack Imperial Arrest Order and/or Oota-Goota Solo? to prevent it.  It is still extremely useful for beat downs or to avoid them for that matter.  Shocking Information is very useful against Manipulator decks that like to take mains out of your hand with cards like Scanning Crew so this can make them pay.  The Signal is useful for pulling out effects, while Sorry About the Mess is good for undercover spies or to eliminate a pesky Tarkin during the control phase before a big battle.  Out of Commission has become a staple in my M+T deck as it hurts retrieval deck like Scum and Villainy or Tie decks.  Plus if you get lucky and pull a Vader or Mara, they can't deploy them again which can kill a Hunt Down deck by itself.  It's also an easily trackable 5 destiny if you can track well, and that becomes very useful for weapon and destiny draws.  If you're using Obi and Luke, then you must watch out for dueling.	With the popularity of the Hunt Down objective, dueling is very popular, and defense is needed.  Glancing Blow is the best protection as it has a great 2nd ability of bringing Vader's power down to 0 during a battle as well as canceling a dueling destiny draw which can easily swing the outcome in your favor.	Courage of a Skywalker is effective as well, and I've seen Swing And a Miss being used for some cool effects like canceling Focused Attack.  There are so many other interrupts, but I feel these are the key ones.  Remember, the way you build the deck is all up to you.  If you want to throw in a Surprise Assault or a Weapon Levitation, go right ahead.  It's your choice, and the more comfortable you feel with the cards you have chosen, the better the deck will end up being.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
<br>
LS Effects have become quite the target of certain DS cards nowadays and with good reason.  They can win you the game.	Mantellian Savrip and Bacta Tank are two effects which change the course of the game, and while I could write a whole article just about them, I'm just going to stay if they stay on the table, there is little chance that your opponent will be able to stop your recurring mains.	Savrip lets you pitch extra mains and useless ships to satisfy attrition and/or battle damage when you lose a battle, but that's OK, as eventually, you'll wear them down.  Despite being expensive, the Bacta Tank is great for recycling characters.  It helps EPP's especially as they retain their built-in weapon after they come out of the tank.  Battle Plan is a necessity as it shuts down heavy draining 1-sided decks like Operatives while Wise Advice and Do Or Do Not are good anti-SAC measures if you don't play them yourself.  Wise Advice has the added benefit of making your grapplers free and helping you in a SAC war with an opponent.  The LS Grappler What're You Trying to Push on Us? is needed in every LS deck, as there is always some abusive interrupt worth grabbing whether it is Scanning Crew, CC Sabacc, or simply that Masterful Move they have been tracking.  Order to Engage is another very useful card as it forces your opponent to confront you when they may not want to or lose 3 force.  This can often be a game-breaking card against a quick deck that likes to spread out like ISB Ops.  Once again, there is a lot of variation is what you choose for your effects, so play what you like and test with what works best for you.<br>
<br>
Here is my sample LS deck that has won convincingly for me for the last 2 years.  I had doubts about posting it here, but I feel it's important to give an example for people to follow.  I'm not going to 'hide it' like other people prefer to do as Decktech is a data sharing network, and this is my small but hopefully helpful contribution.<br>
