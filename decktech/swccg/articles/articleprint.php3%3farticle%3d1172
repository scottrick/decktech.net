I have looked over some of the responses to the first part of this project and I just want to say thank you to those that reviewed and to let you all know that later on in the final stages of this I will bring all the cards together and show people some more ideas. I appreciate the constructive criticism and for the ones that were just harping on me well thanks for that as well. Great way to build up self-esteem for the players.<br>
<br>
Well on to characters. We last left off with KFC so as for the other mains which everyone loves to use there are some other lesser noted Rares and Uncommons that are sorely over looked for the Light Side there's Biggs Darklighter, now I know he's not that usefull but for a Deploy of 2 and Fofit of 5 that's might handy...as well if  you play with Old Times (Luke and Biggs on Tatooine = two more destinies). A great Uncommon also over looked at times is Wyron Serper, A spy to start which is always nice, but his game text allows you to look at cards in your opponents hand. Now that's nice to know especially if something nasty is waiting for you. Keep in mind tho that he can be shocked which can make you loose him, and 4 force so play him wisely (or play with sense). For the Dark Side there's the ever popular Wuher (the Cantina Bartender if your don't recall) he makes people loose their weapons sitting in the Cantina. Hmmmm guys with weapons beware don't come in here if you don't want to use your lightsabers or blasters...As well as one of my favorite characters is Djas Puhr, the first bounty hunter out of Premiere that allows an affordable Power +1 @ sites that have red icons, so specifically speaking drop him in the Cantina and watch that Power 1 Ability 4 go to a Power 4 Ability 4 (If your using your Cantina) and if you drop Sunsdown he adds more powere...With that and immunity to attrition of less than 3 he's really usefull...another overlooked character that I have seen of late is the Prophetes, she's ability 4 and you can declare if you win/loose a battle to retieve a random force. That could help in the long run.<br>
<br>
As well with character which are the main backbone to most decks there are other cards that are really required as well. These would be the weapons of the game, some people (the more advanced) opt to use Character W/Weapons to have more space for other cards. Some of the lesser experienced players do the same because they can't afford all the cards...Well I feel that having them is usefull in more ways...for example the 'lightsabers' all add one to a force drain and that could be beneficial in a force drain game (those are the games that have no battling in them) however some of the over looked weapons that I see are the Blasters, now I know Han's Blaster isn't that usefull but it can target Vehicles which can be nice, Luke's Blaster is especially nice since when you target with Luke the target looses immunity to attrition (this is good in a suicide squad when you send Luke against a Blizzard Walker and you know your going to get good destiny), and Leia's Blaster is especilly nice as well because hit characters are immediately lost, that could be crucial in the game if your battling against a big group of people and you can pop one of the higher forfitted characters immediately. As for other weapons don't over look Disruptors (those that come in the FIXED set of Special Edition) these little babies on a non-unique warrior fires for free and again hit characters are immediately lost. So keep them in mind if you making a smaller non-main deck. As for the weapons on the ground those are some of the perks to having them. As for sapce there are Turbo Lasers and X-Wing Laser Cannons. Some of them are particular to certain vehicles and others are designed for mass distruction if your building a Space Armada then don't look them over, however since we are talking mainly about a ground based deck we won't get into that.<br>
<br>
Vehicles and Starships are not key to winning a game, or to a winning deck, however you always want to have a little space fleet for either side just in case your opponent does something that's tricker than you expected. Thusly for the Dark Side the Bounty Hunters in their Ships are the best thing for that (ECC, EPP, EJP) If you can afford it or have the cards, Outer Rim Scouts and the Bounty Hunter Ships also work quite well. For the light side if you have them, Gold Leader In Gold 1, Red Leader In Red 1 are key in space for just a few ships, as well the Tantive 4 is a great ship for deploying to the Death Star and the only ship that can deploy their without presence or other tricks. Another good ship is Lando In Millennium Falcon, or if you want a little buffer ship you can use the Millennium Falcon and put Cpt. Han Solo on it, also the last great ship for the light side (and keeping in mind that this for a small space fleet) you can never go wrong with the Spiral, deploy as a react to that site that just has one or two ships and a wonderfully high forfit of 8 that's always nice. If you were to go into a Space Deck for either Side Corellian Corvettes for Light and Imperial Class Star Destroyers for Dark are always nice to have (if you have the named Destroyers then I would suggest them for uniqueness and non Grimtaashing...I'll explain this in a little bit)<br>
<br>
One of the final stages for the Wonderfully Powerfull CCG is the Interrupts/Effects that make the game so interesting... Interrupts are cards that can be played at almost anytime during the game and can have an impact on what you do with your deck. For the Light Side a couple of the best Interrupts are: Grimtaash (the ability to look at your opponents hand and pull all the doubles out. It's nice when they have a big hand), The Signal by far one of the best cards (along with Combat Readiness/Reflexes (which allows you to play another Battle Ground or 2 Non Unique sites which can help dramastically for certain decks) to get that much needed Effect when you must have it (or start with a usefull effect like some of the ones that are mentioned a little later) other great interrupts are Attrition Adders (ie: Gift Of The Mentor, Skywalkers) and Hoijux (alot of power vs. your power 2 guy. Hmmmm loose him and nothing and make your opponent committ his mass of people at one site. Oh another wonderfully usefull card in days of old is Nabrum Leids, but this card lost some it's charm...but that will be explained in a little bit. For the Dark Side they have similar cards that do almost the exact same thing and their names are Twi'lex Advisor (The Signal's counter-part) Ghhhk (Houjix's counterpart), Dark Collaboration and I Have You Now (are the counter-parts of the Attrition Adders) and Elis Helrot is the Nabrums... There are other cards that make or break the game that I didn't mention and their are so many Interrupts in the game that you could shake stick at them and they'd keep coming...Of course the overall best Interrupts in the game (and again not all decks need them) are S.A.C. (Sense, Alter, Control) Sense can cancel those nasty Interrupts that your opponent plays (by drawing destiny less than ability (that you have) on the table), Alter Cancels those nasty Effects and cancels Sense and Control cancels Sense and Alter and stops some Force Drains) by far the most useful (in my opinion) of Interrupts. As for Effects, these are what change the game everytime. If your playing certain decks there are certain Effects that go in them. As for the strategy well that's completely up to you, however I find that there should be a couple of Effects in every deck, Reactor Terminal/Traffic Control (these allow you to put cards back into you Used pile when you don't need them during your Control Phase) and Goo Nee Tay/Bad Feeling Have I (these are just annoying cards that make the big boys cost more to get out and slow your opponent down some) I always try to find room for them in all my decks, as well I try to get Security Precautions into my Dark Side deck, as well as Presence Of The Force, and for the Light Side I try and get a Bacta Tank to the table (loose that important character to my opponents battle, and then bring him back during my turn). Another wonderful card that the Dark Side has that the Light sorely lacks is the ability to capture with All Wrapped Up (any character lost to a battle that has a Bounty Hunter their, he can capture) and that's bad when Luke is gone, and he can't be back until he is released. But the Light has something that the Dark doesn't and that's Force Retieval a great ability when you loose alot, and then get it all back. Also one of the most powerful cards that I find are Imperial Arrest Order/Insurrection these are what allow you to pull Docking Bays from your reserve deck (that's good and all but...)They make Nabrum Leids/Ellis Helrot work only during their opponents Move Phase (which eliminates the pile up on one spot and then move during the deploy phase) and smack down that one character for high win. The other benefit is that the Ellis/Nabrum can only work at Exterior site instead of interior which can be a good thing if you trap someone at an interior site and can't get out or Force Drain. the final benefit is the added Forfit to the unique characters. This is a boon in itself.<br>
<br>
There are other Interrupts and Effects that people find useful as do I, I just didn't mention every card, so now we have a basic understanding of compatibility for cards, Sites, Characters, Ships/Vehicles, Weapons and Interrupts/Effects, the final thing that we left out is the Objective, now you don't need this card to win a game, but they can extremely advantageous to helping you achieve a victory (since we were talking about Tatooine there are two GREAT Objectives the Dark Sides is called Court Of The Vile Gangster and the Light Side is called You Could Either Profit By This... (referred to as Court and Profit decks) The Court Of The Vile Gangster is an Objective that allows you to get set up with an Army of Aliens (Scum And Villany, an effect that makes them deploy cheaper, and retieving two force for each battle you initiate is great in these decks) as well as makes use of the Sarlacc and the Rancor, two incredibly powerful creatures. It also makes use of cards that are not that looked at, Trap Door and non Shall Pass (Interrupts that force Light Side to be carefull), For the Light Side we have the Frozen Popsicle, Han Solo, encased in Carbinite to start, well the Objective is for the Rebels to free the greatest smuggler, and when they do they Profit by watching the Dark Side loose more force when they are on Tatooine (or anywhere else) just make sure that they don't cap off han and re-capture him.<br>
<br>
So these are what decks should look like. In the future when your making a deck and you not sure of what you should do then look back here and remember.....ahhh that Interrupt or Mmm yes that ship would work and put them in. I am not saying that this is the best way to make a deck, this is just what I think when I am making a deck. So now that it's done lets review what a deck should look like from a Tattoine based game:<br>
<br>
Light Side will have their Objective (if you want one) some characters, and some weapons to use on them (unless your playing with the enhanced characters) a couple of ships for the inevitable space, and a solid amount of Interrupts and Effects. As for the Dark Side it should look similiar to the light with alot of the same cards. If you ever decide to travel, or want to come to California and you in the Santa Barbara area then look me up and we can go over deck designs, and may play or do a little trading. Well I hope this helped and I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed typing it. Thanks again<br>
