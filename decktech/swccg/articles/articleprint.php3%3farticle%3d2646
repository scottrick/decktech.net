<br>
I think this card is the best vehicle available, bar-none.  Think about it, after you beat them down big time, they will move away with their remaining characters (if any, that is).  With this card you just follow them with your biggest characters and provide yet another beat to them!  Just make sure you clarify who they are before you battle, and they can&#146;t argue.  Also, this card is absolutely killer with Relentless Tracking (yea, I know that&#146;s dark, but there&#146;s also a dark Air-2 Swoop).  It makes sure that you are always at their site and they lose tons of force.  Keep in mind this works with cards like Jodo Kast, Commander Merrejik, Colonel David Jon, etc.<br>

Cloud City: Downtown Plaza - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/cloudcitydowntownplaza.html<br>
<br>
This card is absolute TECH if used correctly.  True, it might be a little costly, but it&#146;s a drain 2 site with benefits.  Just pack 2 or 3 extra CC sites in your deck, then pull them with KTEOF, lose them to a drain, retrieve it next turn, and repeat.  It&#146;s basically reducing damage to you by 1 each turn.  Visage eating you alive?  Try this, it&#146;ll slow it down.<br>
<br>

Dantooine Base Operations/More Dangerous Than You Realize - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/dantooinebaseoperations.html<br>
<br>
Yea, it&#146;s a stretch, and yea, yea go ahead and laugh.  I think this objective has massive potential.  Squadrons themselves are powerful, but they need to replace other starfighters.  Well, with this they&#146;re even more powerful.  Immune to attrition &lt; 4?  Not bad, just like I&#146;ll Take The Leader.  Opponent&#146;s force drains are -1?  That&#146;s always good.  Your squadrons may deploy to Dantooine for (power-3) deploy cost.  Not bad, but remember this, your starfighters are deploy -1 to Dantooine.  So an X-Wing squadron is now deploy 3.  With 9 power.  With X-Wing Laser Cannons (could be I guess... can you deploy them on squadrons?).  This deck needs a helper.  I see it can be a great deck.  DECIPHER LISTEN TO ME!  Make a helper for this card!  Something that makes No Escape useless against Dantooine sites or something, and makes the force drains +2 instead of 1 and the squadrons able to deploy to any system.  Laugh all you want, I like this deck.<br>
<br>

<br>
Disruptor Pistol - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/disruptorpistol.html<br>
<br>
This weapon is absolutely the pinnacle of perfection.  It might be a little expensive, but the rewards are amazing.  Just track Artoo In Red 5 (something very common nowadays) or a 6 or something with Stripper Threepio, and shoot off cards like Mara Jade, Vader, and such and make them LOST.  That is just like Leia&#146;s Blaster Rifle, except it can deploy on anyone and has a higher destiny.  This gun just rocks.  It will turn the battle to your favor no doubt, and you can play I Have A Bad Feeling About This and jump the damage up to extreme levels.  Works fantastically in WYS decks.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Entrenchment - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/entrenchment.html<br>
<br>
This card shuts down drains when used in a neet little combo.  In MBO, this will help a TON.  Pull out Mon Mothma with Strike Planning and use her to pull out your Rebel Techs.  Now Signal for this card or deploy it.  You will be stopping a drain every turn, which definetely helps MBO.  Also, my friend tried this before.  Put Rebel Fleet and Entrenchment in your deck with Y-Wings and Rebel Pilots.  Cancel 2 drains a turn!  Cheap.  Maybe they&#146;re a bit too weak to warrent that, but it&#146;s a good idea.  I like my MBO idea better though :-P.<br>
<br>

<br>
Harc Seff - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/large/harcseff.html<br>
<br>
I forgot who mentioned this card in their deck, but s/he is definetely right.  This card NEEDS to be in EVERY deck that uses related sites.  With Harc, in theory, you can just hold a site right in the middle of 2 others the whole game with lots of characters, and just stop the drains next to you and eventually win.  The best thing is that it&#146;s not It Could Be Worse and they can&#146;t play It&#146;s Worse on it.  Nice card.  Also can be used on their planet, hold one site very firmly (like Dark Deal...) and then just keep stopping their huge drains.  I like him.  Thanks to that mystery man that mentioned this card (I think it was Avatar&#146;s Profit Deck... but not sure).  Thanks again!<br>
<br>

Incom Engineering - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/incomengineer.html<br>
<br>
This card is an absolute GOD in EBO decks.  With Echo Base Garrison, you can pull out your Bantha Droid.  With Mon Mothma or a good draw you will pull this guy out.  Now deploy them to your Docking Bay and now all your X-Wing swarms at the Hoth System are immune to attrition &lt; 5.  Not bad.  And you add 2 to total battle destiny.  Yikes.  Doesn&#146;t look like their gonna fight you there.  And look, at Sullust you have Haven!  Now they don&#146;t want to fight you there either.  That&#146;s 2 systems for a drain of 3 a piece with absolute devastating power there.  Nice.  This guy rules.  He&#146;s also good in MBO decks.  Pull with Mon Mothma, use him to make your total battle destiny +2, and make them immune if they already aren&#146;t.  Nice!  Can also be used in the above Entrenchment combo.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Local Defense - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/localdefense.html<br>
<br>
Nice card.  Use it to pull out the Outrider, Pulsar Skate, Lando in Millenium Falcon... etc and then use those cards to pull out their matching pilots with Squassin.  Also, if you play with the Cloud City sector(s), then this card is a killer.  Add a battle destiny in each of those battles?  Not bad!<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
R3-A2 -http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/r3a2.html<br>
<br>
This card is nasty in decks that use Combined Fleet Action or a mix of support ships and fighter swarms.  Plop this guy aboard your Home One, Liberty, etc and then deploy swarms of X-Wings.  Make him lose all of his ships and pilots and cause massive beatdowns with this little guy.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Scrambled Transmission - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/scrambledtransmission.html<br>
<br>
This card is ultra-super-duper cool.  I think it&#146;s Hayes&#146; Pile that uses this card.  It&#146;s awesome.  Every turn, make it so Merrejik can&#146;t deploy systems.  Every turn, recycle a 5 Destiny or use it with Threepio for tracking and drawing ability.  Use it to pull out Grimtaash combo.  Use that to destroy decks.  I like this card.  Also, wrecks Voyeur, Trinto Duaba, and that Dagobah card I can&#146;t remember, like Dark Times or something.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Slight Weapons Malfunction - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/slightweaponsmalfunction.html<br>
<br>
Ahem, EPP Leia, EPP Han, ECC Lando, ECC Chewie.  I think that&#146;s all I need to say, but I&#146;ll keep talking.  This card rocks with all of them, and also with the above-listed Disruptor Pistol, which adds insult to injury on I Have A Bad Feeling About This.  This card kicks azz.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/theplanetthatitsfarthest.html<br>
<br>
Do you play Watch Your Step?  Do you play Mind What You Have Learned?  Then play this card!  This card will devastate such decks as Dark Deal, flipping Endor Ops, Ralltir Ops, or any heavy-ground deck.  It is a devastating card just like A Bright Center To The Universe.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
They&#146;re Tracking Us - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/light/small/theyretrackingus.html<br>
<br>
Do you want a quicker way to flip your Hidden Base?  Then pack 1 or 2 of these.  This will flip your objective much faster, and cancel more of their drains quicker and such and such.  Can also wreck decks that use Accuser or Speeder Bikes to zip by and kill you.  Another way to use it, but will be much less useful, would be to pack a Bespin system in there if Speed Deal is big in your area (which doesn&#146;t use the system).  When they deploy their sites, play this and pull out the Bespin system.  Then play The Planet That It&#146;s Farthest From and ruin their drains.  It&#146;s good, but rare.<br>

There you go.  I hope you enjoyed this article and I hope that some of you will use some of those cards in your future decks.  Keep an eye out for my upcoming deck called &quot;Goggled Cheese&quot; which encorporates elements from my Unsung articles into real decks that are completely tournament-viable and very devastating.  Laterz.<br>
