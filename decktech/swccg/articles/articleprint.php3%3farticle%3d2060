Everyone will be packing some Reflections 2 tech.  Here&#146;s a rundown of what we&#146;ll be seeing in response to the new stuff.<br>
<br>
-Grabbers with Wise Advice/Oppressive Enforcement<br>
As if we don&#146;t see this enough.  The combo interrupts will be prime candidates for the grabbers.  I don&#146;t know why anyone would play with the combos and the original interrupts, but if they do, they&#146;ll be doubly screwed.<br>
<br>
-Choke<br>
You see a few of the top players use this now, but soon everyone will pack one or two.	There&#146;s just too many deadly darkside aliens.  If Mighty Jabba, Elephant Man, and the enhanced bounty hunters weren&#146;t scary enough, now we&#146;ve got to deal with Arica, Snoova, and Prince Xizor.	Here&#146;s a scenario: DS has Xizor and Guri in the Cantina with PotF draining away like mad.	Light side doesn&#146;t have any way of stopping the drain, so they have to take over the site.  But how?  Dark has power 11 or 12, a battle destiny, and both characters immune to less than 5.  Light must have at least 7 ability to get a destiny, and they are limited to just one.  There&#146;s only two easy solutions to this problem.  One is Clash, the other is Choke.  Clash requires a saber and can be canceled with Crush, making Choke the slightly easier way to do it.<br>
<br>
-Double Agent/Nevar Yalnal<br>
If Mara, Boushh, TK-422, Artoo, U-3PO, and company weren&#146;t reason enough to use it, now there&#146;s Arica (undercover Mara), Corran Horn, and Mercenary Armor.  MercArmor not only turns a rebel into a spy, but adds 3 to power, provides defense value 4, and immunity to less than 3.	Here&#146;s the big one: it cancels Imp Barrier.  LS will no doubt put this on someone hard to kill or someone they want to last longer in a battle, like Leia or Han.	Well, silly them.  They just made it much easier to take out a main if you&#146;re packing Nevar Yalnal and a spy (who doesn&#146;t use Mara?).<br>
<br>
-Corporal Beezer<br>
This little lady&#146;s always been so-so.  A generic scrub in most aspects, but a god when facing a deck that relies on reacts.  Now we&#146;re gonna see her pulling out Obi-Wan&#146;s Journal and MercArmor.  Some people aren&#146;t too excited about the Journal.  Evidently they&#146;ve never had JK Luke disarmed and immediately operated.  Beezer is the final step for this strategy.  Some people will use Crix to grab her, and maybe Strike Planning to grab him.<br>
<br>
-Anti-Kessel Run cards<br>
Expect to see the Outrider and the Pulsar Skate to be smuggling spice in the near future.  The Outrider makes Utinni effects that retrieve immune to Alter, so there goes the easiest way to stop it.  Every, and I mean, EVERY Dark side should pack Secret Plans.  It always has, and always will be a game-winning card.  Add to that a fully loaded Chimera or Executor and Something Special Planned For Them, and LS will be wasting an entire turn of activation retrieving, assuming they have that much left and can activate that much in a turn.<br>
<br>
-Look Sir, Droids<br>
Artoo &amp; Threepio and Leebo will be at the very least, annoying.  I want them to die.  Should enough people agree with me, we&#146;ll eventually see Droid Shutdown.<br>
<br>
That&#146;s all I can think of right now.  I look forward to seeing what interesting decks develop from Reflections 2, and how players counter them.<br>
