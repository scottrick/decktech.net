It was to have a tournament series where premiere was the only set playable, and then a few months later let ANH into the environment. The postee had the idea that this would encourage newer players getting into Star Wars by having a limited number of cards in the environment. The problem is that many cards were either very weak or very strong (i.e. &#146;were all going to be a lot thinner&#146; = weak, Nabrun Leids = strong) and the fact that bullet cards are not available until later sets are allowed into the environment will doom this idea.<br>
<br>
While this idea has good intentions, I&#146;ve given this a bit of thought and would like to see what people would think of this idea. I&#146;ve decided to post this as an article rather than a rumour, mainly because only an article can describe the details needed. My idea is that rather than everyone learn the hard way how some of those old abusive decks worked, I was thinking of Decipher coming out with a base set of reprinted cards, a way of streamlining the game by restricting what cards can be played. Rather than having to pack counter cards Vs inserts or other abuseable strategies, Decipher can choose not to reprint those cards in the base set. This way would be a concise set with a definite focus allowing Decipher to more able to decide the course of the Meta game. Also by having a tournament structure where the base set of reprinted cards are readily available, it is easy for newcomers to enter the game as they don&amp;#8217;t have to learn all about errata and asteroid rules.<br>
<br>
Although Decipher possibly wouldn&amp;#8217;t like spending money on a new tournament format and reprinting old cards, which would not generate sales from the veterans of the game, it would make sense for getting new players into the game. How many times have you heard potential players decide not to play because they think Darth Vaders are $50 and you need all the main characters to win a game? This way, rather than having to spend a lot of money on out of date boosters and cards which can be very hard to get ahold of a player can get boosters of the base set and of the last few sets (which rotate out after a certain period of time but will still be allowed to be played in classic tourneys.) and as for making a new tournament structure, I don&amp;#8217;t think its required because of the closed environment structure already in place.<br>
<br>
Also, Deciphers idea of EP1 tourneys have given me an idea, if you wanted the card game to follow the movies, here&#146;s a novel way, in addition to the set icon, if the card is tied to a particular movie (say Grand Moff Tarkin or Admiral Ackbar) then the card will have an icon which denotes what movie it came from, if there is no specific movie (such as the objectives HB or Ralops) then they don&amp;#8217;t receive an extra icon. By doing this, you allow not only Ep1 only tourneys but also Ep 2 - Ep 6 only tourneys which would be in the closed environment tournament structure. Cards that don&amp;#8217;t have an extra icon (but has been reprinted in the base set) would be allowed to be played in any of the restricted tourneys (like sense and alter, they would be present in all eras)<br>
<br>
Some people have said that Reflections 1 and 2 are ways of getting new platers into Star Wars. The problem with R1/2, is that its just Premiere, Special Ed, Jabbas Palace and Cloud City. While allowing access to these sets, some of the other sets like Endor and Dagobah would be difficult to obtain so does not do a good job of encouraging new players. Also while supplying cards to the newer player, it still does not solve the problem of the vast amount of cards required to collect before making a tournament level deck.<br>
<br>
As for the cards printed in the base set, they would be simply reprints of earlier cards, although they will have corrected text and movie icons if appropriate, to be played in this &#146;type 2&#146; the cards used would have to be printed in the base set and the most recent of sets. In this way, Decipher can ban certain cards, while allowing them to still be played; in this case, not reprinting inserts in the base set would effectively ban the cards from the closed environment. Collectors and players worried about weather they would have to collect these new cards to play in the new closed environment tournaments, any version of cards which are reprinted may be used (so you don&amp;#8217;t need the movie icon, but you can treat it as it has one if its been reprinted.)<br>
<br>
As for a marketing idea, to sell these &#146;new&#146; cards, it can be explained as a new starting point for new players where everyone is on an even footing. Rather than Deciphers attempts in D*2 (which was better than there first attempt) and Special Ed, this way would allow new players access to the same card pool as older players, since the card sets are readily available and limited, it would be relatively easier for the newbie to collect the cards as they would only have 300 or 400 in the base set and the latest 2 or 3 expansions rather than all the cards that are in the open constructed card pool. If you were thinking of a new tournament structure, use the closed environment for the new type 2 tournaments. And to get older collectors to collect what are essentially reprints of older cards, simply put a new pic on them. The collectors would then attempt to collect the new &#146;AI&#146; cards. I don&amp;#8217;t take credit for this idea, magic has done something simpler, but really, if magic didn&amp;#8217;t have the type 2 system, how hard would it be for a beginner to get into magic?<br>
<br>
Id like to know what everyone thinks of this idea, would people play in the closed environment? Is this a good way of enticing new players to the game? By having an affordable entry point in the game and where there is no need to chase up out of print packs of Endor and ANH. I hope Decipher does take this idea on board because I would support it wholeheartedly as many potential players are scared off by the amount of cards in the pool and the perceived expense and rarity of the main characters. I hope I haven&amp;#8217;t wasted your time over an idea of how to entice new players into Star Wars to stop this great game from dying out. I realise I may get some poor reviews because people expect just articles dealing with how to play or how certain cards are so good, although I fel that this is a worthy discussion of how to entice new players to Star Wars, in the end its up to you to decide and rate accordingly, Thankyou for your time.<br>
