Why Is ROps So Good?<br>
   Well it is expensive to get to Ralltiir for LS characters, which makes it hard to interfere with the DS' plans. The DS gets a huge battling ability when the objective is flipped (+1 to Battle Destiny for each Ralltiir site Imperials occupy). A skilled player who tracks his destiny can outbattle anything, whether in space or on the ground. The ability to get whatever card he wants from the reserve deck (by using 2 force) adds to it's power along with a -1 drain modifier. These powers makes this objective very balanced and if you&amp;#8217;ve read the articles on the balance-issue you know how important that is.<br>
<br>
2. What Are The Downside Of The Objective?<br>
   It doesn't drain for much on Ralltiir (1 at every site) and Ralltiir isn't a battleground system which makes the deck vulnerable to Battle Plan.<br>
   He (the opponent) needs to control all Ralltiir locations except 1 to be able to avoid a flip-back (if you control two Ralltiir Locations it flips back to the 0-side). This makes a lot of cards being locked on Ralltiir sites.<br>
   The initial activation is bad (only 1 icon provided by Ralltiir) which makes it hard to flip the objective fast.<br>
<br>
3. Get To The Point<br>
   There are of course a number of ways to deal with ROps, but the point is to do it without making your deck worthless against other decktypes. (In my area these ROps decks are very dominant and we have even had Ralltiir Local Uprisings with Power Harpoons and Speeder Bikes to deal with this dominance (however they were never paired against a ROps-deck in the last tournament I directed)).<br>
<br>
There are 2 different methods of dealing with ROps although a combination of them probably is the best:<br>
1. Outdraining or 2. Battling. I think the second is the most versatile way and you can't handle a ROps deck without being able to battle, but I'll bring both up.<br>
<br>
4. Outdraining<br>
As I mentioned before, this objective doesn't drain for much and that knowledge can be used to try to outdrain it. I know that this is tough because of the -1 force drain modifier, but it is indeed possible. The thing is that the ROps deck is a defensive deck that goes wherever you are and try to battle you to death. This is why you'll need forces to protect your drains, while still draining for at least 2-3 (without the -1 drain) on a few locations. That's not easy but it can be done. Here are a few ideas to how it can be done:<br>
. Pucumir and M&amp;T on Cloud City. A deck like this can easily outdrain a ROps deck and with cards like Path Of Least Resistance and keeping your characters indoors you have a chance in battles as well.<br>
. Space drains. You need to control at least both Kessel and Coruscant and make sure he doesn&amp;#8217;t convert your Coruscant (which is a big risk). I'd suggest keeping the Super Falcon (Falcon, Captain Han and EPP Leia) on Coruscant and a minor fleet at Kessel to force him to Coruscant unless he can afford the +2 deploy to Kessel (granted by the Coruscant gametext).<br>
. Profit decks. These have a huge drain potential when flipped because of their ability to make the opponent lose force without draining. Keep Han indoors (no Tramples) and protect him well with at least Ben and something to cancel a swinging or choking Vader. The Cantina Shuffle (Mos Eisley gametext with the Cantina out) is powerful in these decks.<br>
. Ewok decks. Don't laugh just yet. These decks can drain like nothing else (Graak, Kazak and Ithorians) while having a lot of interrupts against armoured vehicles (AT-ST/ATs). A drain of three on three different sites isn&amp;#8217;t that hard to manage. Just be prepared for the battles and keep the important Ewoks indoors or in enclosed vehicles.<br>
. Operatives. If you manage to keep your objective flipped he drains for just about nothing.<br>
<br>
The big problem with outdraining him is that he can flip his objective undisturbed (except for the force loss) which means a pretty quick flip. Usually he gets Battle Order out and tries to satisfy it to get the upper hand in the drain race. Kashyyyk with a strong fleet is a quite common sight when playing against ROps. So you&amp;#8217;ll need to be able to drain for more than his 5 (2 on Kashyyyk and 1+1+1 on the ground) with a -1 modifier while surviving his attacks.<br>
<br>
5. Battling<br>
This is by far the most effective way to deal with the deck. It is possible to win in battles even after the flip, but it is a lot harder so you should try to keep the objective unflipped. This is done by controlling at least one Ralltiir locations (two if you want to flip back) which isn't easy.<br>
<br>
5.1 What to expect:<br>
   A good ROps deck flips between second and fourth turn so you haven't got all day to hinder it. He will probably fetch one site/turn and then put some reactable AT-STs on at least 2 sites when he flips. After that he adjusts his deck to yours. You usually only get 3 icons from it and these icons are probably provided by three of the following diamond sites: *Jungle, *Swamp, *Spaceport: Docking Bay, *Desert or *Forest. It depends on what the opponent is playing, but against Martin's deck it's usually the three first. Remember that the Forest does not provide immunity to vehicles, only characters. If your opponent have missed this, you have an advantage. Rod 'Trando' Latham used the Desert along with Sandwhirl in his deck Ralltiir Universal v3, which I think is cool enough to bring up here.<br>
<br>
5.2 What to do:<br>
There are two ways that differs here: 1. the space way and 2. the ground way. Once again a combination of the two is probably the best.<br>
I&amp;#8217;ll start with some general tips though:<br>
Start with Battle Plans unless you play with something that will hinder his early small drain on his sites or if you can get a huge activation going early. Battle Plan also makes it free to battle (his Swamp's, otherwise great, gametext is useless) which can be a game winner since it&amp;#8217;s expensive as it is to deploy to Ralltiir. This way you have some time to assemble your forces before he has flipped and has all the cards he wants in his hand. Read Martin/Marteen's deck carefully so you know what the basics look like.<br>
   Depending on your starting hand and first draws you must decide whether you want to try to prevent him from flipping or if you want to build up for a smackdown that can wait for the flip.<br>
<br>
5.2.1 The Space Way<br>
To be able to get a good drain going, ROps needs to occupy a system and thereby suspend Battle Plans. In order to do this they have to come to space and this is a perfect opportunity for you to attack with the Super Falcon or with 'S-Foiled' X-wings (the most powerful space tacticts for LS at the moment), just be prepared for an eventual Imperial Barrier on your ships or an Alter on your S-Foils. And if your only real power in space is the SFalcon, then you have to lure him up with a quick, small ship to Ralltiir (he'll have to occupy Ralltiir in order to flip) or a good drain on Kessel (Coruscant is too risky since he'll probably just convert it) and then try to catch him with a beatdown.<br>
<br>
Most Ralltiir decks only have 5-6 starships (probably BinHT, BinS1, ZinMH, Devastator and something else). Have this in mind when playing against it. If you succesfully beat four ships to the lost pile, you have pretty good chances of being able to control space. Cards like X-wing laser cannon, Eject! Eject! and multiple destinies are powerful ways of killing the imperial spacefleet. Just be aware of the fact that he&amp;#8217;ll probably grab your Organized Attack, try to alter your S-Foils (bring Luke or Red Leader) and draw destinies of 4-9 all the time. If you have a massive space fleet you'll need Order To Engage because of all those Imperial Barriers out there that prevents a smackdown.<br>
<br>
5.2.2 The Ground Way<br>
There are two ways to deliver battle damage and ground control on this deck. 1 speeders, 2 mains. Speeders are very powerful. Anyone not prepared for a power of 30+ for something like 7 force will have a hard time winning. Speeders are not affected by the +2 deploy and if you just include Romas 'Lock' and a few ASPs you're ready to do battle on Ralltiir. The best way to play with these speeders is by looking up Clint 'GameMaster' Hays' 'Layin The Smack Down' (which by the way is pure genious in my eyes). The deck is about Clak'dor Uprising with about 20 speeders and 2 of each of Draw Their Fire, Mech Failure, Frozen Assets. Put one or two of your sites to his Ralltiir so you can flip him back easily and then try to flip your own objective so he won't drain anything. Battle Order will hurt you sooner or later, but if you keep his objective on the 0-side, you have a good shot at a win.<br>
   With the mains, there's the 'Rebels deploy +2'-text. If Bad Feeling is out as well it's 9 force for EPP Luke and all Obis. That's tough to come by. You need to activate a lot in other words. A Hidden Base deck can get extreme activation early if fetching Dagobah and the Hut first turn and then keep putting out some systems. You can have a forcepile of at least 20 in your third turn and with some help of Tunnel Visions you might be able to go to work. Remember that characters with ability&lt;4 are pretty easy Trampled with a good destiny tracker so I'd stick Han in space and go down with Obi, Luke and eventually Leia and bringing destiny adder cards for the battle damage. In other words, I'm talking about an EPP hitsquad that were so popular just after EPP was released. But since you're limited to those high-ability characters you'll need something to keep them on table or at least come back soon. Cards like Bacta Tank (can be Altered), Yoda at his Hut, Mantellian Savrip (can be Altered) or Ben Kenobi. Personally I prefer Ben, but then you'll need to be on Tatooine and Nabrun him over. The Tank is good in many ways, but it is costly enough to play against ROps as it is and the Savrip is so easily Masterful Moved with other decks so you'll need to pack a lot of Senses. Yoda at his hut is really limited (almost only MWYHL decks), but is a great help against the 7-side of ROps (just losing Luke instead of both Luke and Obi for example). As for being able to deliver battle damage Mechanical Failure is a great card (Lateral Damage for Vehicles), but once again you have to be aware of Alters. As for the reacting AT-STs there aren't very many ways but Romas or Beezer (easy Trampled) or Sense (Alter and Grabber). The point is that if you play with destiny adders you will put his characters in the lost pile and they won't be coming back while yours hopefully stay on the table or get back soon. So if you can take the fight to Ralltiir and keep your characters alive you have a good chance. The problem is that you can't drain for much on Ralltiir and that can make it a pretty long game, because of your unsignificant drain It's only a matter of time before the opponent has all his important cards out; Imperial Arrest Order to hinder Nabrun, a saber to hit your high-ability characters, Alters to cancel your important effects, etc.<br>
   With these tips, I recommend the following:<br>
Play a fake hidden base with Dagobah, D:Hut, Yoda, Wise Advice, 2 Grabbers, Battle Order, the Super Falcon, some more systems for activation, 3 EPP Luke, 3 Ben, his lightsaber, one or two rebel barrier (chose your fights), 3-4 Tatooine sites, 2 Nabruns, Order 2 Engage and at least 3 Tunnel Visions. This is a solid ground that you can adjust to your preferences and that has a chance against most decks. If you want my version of this deck then look at 'A Deck I Really Like (LS)', but there should be an Order To Engage instead of one Under Attack.<br>
<br>
5.3 Where Should I Attack?<br>
Usually where he is weakest, but don&amp;#8217;t forget these sites and what they do:<br>
*Swamp -the +3 text is why you should start with Battle Plan. If BPlan is out it's just to attack.<br>
*Jungle -the -2 text makes this probably the worst place to attack if you haven't got a LOT more power than him.<br>
*Forest -OBSERVE: only characters are immune here so if he has AT-STs you have the upper hand.<br>
*Spaceport: Docking Bay -the +1 to deploy for pilots is a real pain when you've already used 2 extra force.<br>
*Desert -beware of a Sandwhirl, except that it's just the Battle Destiny -1 text which should make you think twice about using your destiny adders here.<br>
<br>
6. General Tips<br>
The Bith Shuffle -don't let him track those destinies.<br>
Eject! Eject! -to deal with those BHunter decks (especially Bossk's).<br>
Rebel Barrrier -lets you pick the fights.<br>
Romas'Lock'Navander or Corporal Beezer -prevent reacts.<br>
Mechanical Failure -Lateral Damage for Vehicles.<br>
Grabbers -for his Alters and Tramples.<br>
Under Attack -crash the AT-STs with your EPP sabers and a destiny of 1 or 2.<br>
Boushh -she'll be hard to Trample and can be used for Under Attack with Anakin's saber.<br>
Demotion -if you play odds and don't like Vesden (I do not recommend playing odds against this deck because of the high destiny AT-ST pilots that can be fetched from reserve deck) or to put on an AT-ST pilot or Commander Arden to deny battle destiny draw.<br>
Imperials -remember that it's only sites he controls with imperials that add to the battle destinies.<br>
Yoda's Gimmer Stick -great unless it gets altered, there is usually only 3-4 characters with ability&gt;3 and yours is immune to attrition as well (the battle damage bonus is somewhat suspended). Anyone willing to trade me one of these can contact me for my haves.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't follow ALL my advice here, but you must consider how to play against this great objective or you'll be in deep trouble when facing a good player with a ROps deck in his hands. And my hope is that you have found something in here to prepare you for that match. Good luck next time you play against Ralltiir Operations.<br>
