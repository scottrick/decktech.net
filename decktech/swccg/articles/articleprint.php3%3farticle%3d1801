Let&#146;s start off by answering oneof thos questions, and go from there.<br>
<br>
Light Side Star Destroyers<br>
<br>
     Premiere comes out. People think the idea of a card game based on Star Wars is cool. They immediately start wondering what the Emperor will be like. A few years later, Death Star II hits the market. And people are still wondering about the future. One question regards this line of Heavy Turbolaser Battery for LS:<br>
<br>
Use 4 Force to deploy on your Star Cruiser (or Star Destroyer).<br>
<br>
Right now, there are no LS Star Destroyers. So people naturally wonder, why include this line on the card? There are 2 possibilities as to why the LS version can deploy on your Star Destroyer.<br>
<br>
1. Look in your Glossary under Undercover. There is a way, though highly improbable, of your Undercover spy gaining control of your opponent&#146;s Star Destroyer. So, it is possible at this time to deploy the LS Heavy Turbolaser Battery on your Star Destroyer.<br>
<br>
2. In the world of Star Wars mytholoy, including the books, movies, games, etc., there is a Star Destroyer stolen by the Rebellion. It&#146;s called the Eviscerator, and it was captured by Rogue Squadron. Now, Decipher could make the Eviscerator into a card. This is questionable, for a number of reasons. More on this later.<br>
<br>
A-Wing Squadron<br>
<br>
     Someone at Decipher may&#146;ve screwed up. In the &#146;currentrulings080800.pdf&#146; file downloadable at Decipher.com, there is an entry for squadron-class starships. No surprise there. But what is surprising is this portion of that entry:<br>
<br>
A squadron is NOT targeted or treated as a starfighter in any way. Thus, for example, an A-Wing Squadron cannot board a Mon Calamari Cruiser (it has capacity only for starfighters) but a Star Destroyer may carry a TIE Squadron (which takes up the capacity of 3 TIEs).<br>
<br>
What&#146;s an A-Wing Squadron? It doesn&#146;t exist. As a card, anyway. It may exist though, in the minds of Decipher&#146;s playtesters. Who knows, maybe A-Wing Squadron and TIE Defender squadron (see below) have been playtested? But there&#146;s also the possibility that it&#146;ll never exist. I might just be getting exited. After all, there&#146;s technically no such card as a &#146;Mon Calamari Cruiser&#146; or &#146;TIE Squadron&#146;. These may just be generic references any Mon Cal cruiser, or any TIE squadron. This means that A-Wing squadron might just be a generic reference to any old squadron. I wouldn&#146;t be surprised if they made an A-Wing Squadron, but then again, I wouldn&#146;t be surprised if they didn&#146;t make it at all.<br>
<br>
TIE Defender Squadron<br>
<br>
     Get out your Gloassary. Look on the back. Check out the upper-right corner. Why is there a picture of 3 TIE Defenders in a squadron formation? The fact that they have an image for a TIE Defender squadron is interesting all by itself. It doesn&#146;t appear to be the image of the TIE Defender Mark 1 card simply duplicated a couple of times. It&#146;s a completely different image. Why would Decipher go through the trouble of making the image of 3 Defenders flying in squadron formation? True, it may not be that hard to do, but they didn&#146;t have any reason to make that image unless they were to use it in a place other than the Glossary, such as a card. A TIE Defender Squadron? Hey, it could happen.<br>
<br>
Cards from books<br>
<br>
     Shadows Of The Empire. It&#146;s a set that will soon (hopefully) be out, the first set to be based on a novel. We can only imagine if Decipher made cards from other novels. Will they? Here&#146;s the situation. To make Shadows Of The Empire into a set, Decipher had to get a special license. This license required work, money, and time. So to make more cards based on novels, Decipher would have to obtain more licenses. In other words, they could make other cards from novels. But I think they&#146;ll first wait and see if the effort to make SOTE will be worth it. But let&#146;s say they make a fortune on SOTE. It&#146;s insanely popular, people love it, they want more. So Decipher decides to make elements from other novels into cards. Here&#146;s a small sampling of what we could look forward to:<br>
<br>
Light Side:<br>
<br>
Leia&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Rogue Squadron cards (12 pilots, 12 ships, new Tycho, Eviscerator, etc.)<br>
Jedi trainees<br>
Jedi Holocron<br>
Lady Luck (Lando&#146;s ship)<br>
<br>
Dark Side:<br>
<br>
Carrack-class Cruiser (capital ship)<br>
Death Star Prototype<br>
Luuke Skywalker (Luke&#146;s Dark Side clone)<br>
Joruus C&#146;Baoth (Dark Side clone of a dead Jedi Master)<br>
Eclipse-Class Star Destroyer (bigger than Executor, equipped with a superlaser)<br>
Interdictor Cruiser (capital, other ships can&#146;t go into hyperspace while present)<br>
Lancer-Class Frigate (capital designed to combat starfighters)<br>
Ssi-Ruuvi stuff (paddle-beamers, ships, Ssi-Ruuvi aliens, &#146;entechment&#146;, etc.)<br>
Sun Crusher (blows up stars)<br>
Starbuster (causes stars to supernova)<br>
Galaxy Gun<br>
World Devastator<br>
<br>
and other countless characters, ships, technology, weapons, devices, etc., not to mention Objectives, Interrupts, and Effects. If Decipher did decide to make cards from other novels, that&#146;d introduce a wide plethora of new cards, new decks, new possibilities. There are literally thousands of cards available from the Star Wars world other than the movies. Besides, Decipher has already made cards not in the movies. Mara Jade, Medium Bulk Feighter, Jabba&#146;s Space Cruiser, Krayt Dragon, Sandwhirl, Ice Storm, etc., none of which are in the movies. Decipher has also made images not seen in the movies, like Zuckuss&#146;s Snare Rifle, Mist Hunter, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, other bounty hunter stuff, and Luke&#146;s mask on First Aid. In a way, Decipher has already begun creating cards from places other than the movies. Shadows Of The Empire is an extension of this. If we did indeed get cards from the novels, we&#146;d instantly be overwhelmed with new stuff. And it&#146;s possible. We&#146;ll just have to wait and see.<br>
