You hop on DeckTech and grab the top decks, play a few testing games with them, change a few cards, and off you go.  Sometimes you go 3-3, sometimes 4-2, and rarely 5-1, but you hardly ever seem able to pick up the big win.  If this sounds anything like you, I'd like to suggest a novel concept: build your decks from scratch.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of advantages and disadvantages to building your own decks or using someone else's which we will explore later.  But first, let me give you a brief synopsis as to why I suddenly decided to write this article.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know me, my name is Steven Lewis, and I have been playing Star Wars CCG since the very day the Premiere release was put on the shelves.  I won the 2nd tournament I ever played in (with 30+ participants just after Hoth was released) and have a drawer filled with tournament T-shirts and regional trophies.  My two biggest accomplishments were reaching #2 in Decipher's  world ratings and placing 2nd at the '99 World Championships.  Why bother you with these details?  Because I believe that my success can be divided into about 60% original deckbuilding, 35% playing skill and practice, and 5% lucky pairings.<br>
<br>
How do I know that my original deckbuilding has been so effective?  Well, the super-fast operatives I designed won '98 Origins.  The first regional I played in which I got to the final duel was with a Walker Garrison deck I literally built 5 minutes before the tournament.  And a few weeks ago at Origins 2000, for the first time in my SWCCG career, I played two decks which I had NOT built and ended up 3-3 two days in a row.<br>
<br>
The advantages to borrowing decks are simple.  1) No Time.  You simply don't have the time and effort to hurl out a decent deck.  This means that you have priorities other than SW:CCG (as do most of us).  OR 2) You suck.  Every time you build your own deck, you get hammered.  For you, I suggest reading some of the many &quot;How to...&quot; deckbuilding articles on this website.<br>
<br>
The big disadvantage to borrowing decks is simply the lack of pure understanding of the author's intent concerning certain cards and strategies.  There are doubtless many intricacies and &quot;techish&quot; strategies involved in the use of certain cards over others which you do not see.  Therefore, you are sacrificing deck integrity by changing cards and you often end up with a mediocre version of a really good deck.<br>
<br>
Why build your own deck?  Simple.  Look at almost any &quot;How to Build a Deck&quot; article and you will see three universal concepts: 1) determine your purpose and strategy, 2) pull out any cards that help your strategy, 3) cut it down to 60.  During the final step, you usually come down to about 5-10 cards which you cannot decide whether to put in or pull out.	You mentally weigh the advantages and disadvantages of every card with their possible alternatives and determine finally the best 60 cards possible for your intended strategy.  This is the key o original deckbuilding.<br>
<br>
Once you have your deck, you have an enormous advantage over other players who use other people's decks.  First of all, you know every trick and twist of the deck better than anyone and when you draw a card (for instance), you know instantly how it helps you and why it is in your deck.  When you didn't build your deck, you don't have this luxury.  Sometimes you even wonder why someone else put that card in at all (hence most of the unfounded comments left on this website when reviewing others' decks).	Secondly, the deck is automatically tuned to your specific playing style.  This makes the deck not only more effective, but more fun to play as well.  Also, a mediocre original deck (I believe) is often better in a tournament than an excellent deck that everyone has seen before.  Your opponents will not know how to react to an original strategy, and they have zero experience in playing against that strategy, whereas vs. a more popular style of deck, your opponent likely has played against it and knows precisely what is required to beat you.  If you build your own deck, you automatically have an advantage over your opponent before the game even begins!<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that one's success at SW:CCG is often directly proportional to the amount of time spent in deck preparation.	So even if you go against my advice and borrow your decks, at least go through them card-for-card and determine if it's worth changing some out for others.  But for those of you who crave success and desire the most fun and original strategies, try building a couple decks and see what happens...<br>
