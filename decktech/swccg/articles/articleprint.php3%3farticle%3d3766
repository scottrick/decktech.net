<br>
The main introduction is back in part one. This is part two. This article is designed to explain unique ways of constructing destroyer droid decks and playing destroyer droid strategies.<br>
<br>
((( CLEANUP WORK )))<br>
<br>
As usual, I can never manage to hit EVERYTHING on my first shot. So, here are some cards that should have been in the last article.<br>
<br>
Self Destruct Mechanism - (4) - USED INTERRUPT<br>
Sacrifice (forfeit) a droid to cancel all attrition against you at same site this turn. OR Re-target an opponent&#146;s weapon to one of your droids at same site. If droid is lost, use original target&#146;s forfeit number.<br>
<br>
Due to the fairly low forfeit value of Destroyer Droids, this card should probably be in almost any destroyer droid deck you make. I have managed to work without it on occasion but attrition eventually ruins me.<br>
<br>
Forced Servitude - (4) - EFFECT<br>
Deploy on an opponent&#146;s location. Whenever you lose a droid from hand or Life Force, it satisfies Force loss up to its forfeit value. Once per turn, you may play Imperial Code Cylinder to cancel a Force drain where you have a droid. Effect canceled if opponent controls this location.<br>
<br>
I actually do not own this effect so I couldn&#146;t really tell you how effective it is. It seems relatively painful. I do fine without it, though. Although satisfying force loss quicker is nice, I don&#146;t like the fact that you are chucking the very arsenal that your deck is based around. I mean, you can only have so many destroyer droids in a deck. It might be worth a try, though. Someone try it, d-mail me, and tell me how it went... ^_^<br>
<br>
Dioxis - (3) - LOST INTERRUPT<br>
Use 2 Force to target two opponent s Jedi at same interior battleground. Targets may not participate in battle for remainder of turn. OR Target opponent s Jedi. Draw destiny. If destiny &gt; 2, target&#146;s game text is canceled for remainder of turn.<br>
<br>
Handy for canceling immunity to attrition or just plain removing two Jedi from battle. If the opponent has two Jedi and any other characters, this causes a significant power swing (especially if you have the advantage at the Generator Core).<br>
<br>
((( DECK DILEMMAS )))<br>
<br>
So, exactly how versatile can a pure destroyer droid deck be? Very...read on and find out why!<br>
<br>
[ OPPONENT&#146;S FORCE DRAIN BONUSES ]<br>
Pesky lightsabers! Stupid Pucimir! Blasted objectives! What are destroyer droids supposed to do about opponent&#146;s huge force drains? You need to have the following cards in your deck: Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans (always start this card), Imperial Decree, Yavin 4: Docking Bay, Hoth: Echo Docking Bay, and Resistance Defensive Shield. Use Imperial Arrest Order to whip out each docking bay. They are both Rebel Base locations! Take them both over with a relatively large arsenal! Now the opponent&#146;s force drain bonuses are gone (unless of course they are playing Echo Base Operations...then you need to occupy two Hoth sites). You don&#146;t need to whip Resistance out right away, but you should ALWAYS be satisfying its conditions. For one thing, if Imperial Decree doesn&#146;t come through for ya, you can slap down Resistance to make an emergency defense. Second, by satisfying the demands of Resistance, you also satisfy the demands of Honor Of The Jedi. Honor Of The Jedi will ruin your entire strategy by taking away your destroyer droids&#146; direct damage from weapon hits.<br>
<br>
[ OPPONENT&#146;S INTERRUPT GRABBERS ]<br>
I&#146;ve always hated interrupt grabbers. They slow everything down and basically place your interrupts out of play. So, the solution is to overwhelm the opponent with a VARIETY of interrupts. Don&#146;t use STRICTLY Rolling, Rolling, Rolling or Master, Destroyers! to pull destroyer droids out of your deck. Don&#146;t use STRICTLY Oh, Switch Off or Master, Destroyers! to stop weapon attacks! Use a very intricate mix! Usually, if you fry the opponent&#146;s brain enough, they will not grab anything. Have a little of everything. Sure, if the opponent is annoyed by only one particular card, they will grab it (i.e. using Oh, Switch Off to save P-59 from Fallen Portal).<br>
<br>
[ NOT ENOUGH FORCE OR LIFE FORCE ]<br>
When you enter the late period of the game, it starts to become hard to have enough force to fire each weapon and have enough destiny in your Reserve Deck to fire so many guns. First step is Force retrieval. After Her! is the best way to retrieve small portions (especially when that blasted Aim High is on table). Assuming you&#146;ve set up the anti-force-drain-bonuses configuration, use After Her! on a site that you have easy access to. Don&#146;t be using it on the Home One: War Room or something (they could be using Obi-Wan&#146;s Journal). Remember, it makes your battle destinies +1 there so assuming Nute Gunray is at his post, destoyer droids are now sixes for battle destiny (seven if one of the unique ones).<br>
<br>
It is difficult to save enough force to fire so many destroyer droid cannons. I have found that Combat Readiness if extremely effective in solving this. It is a destiny five cycling interrupt that lets you activate one destiny worth of force. Also, it says &quot;up to&quot; in the text so you could just cycle it at the beginning of a battle if you have enough destiny to cover for it.<br>
<br>
You Swindeled Me is another fun option. Although it is unpredicible, in a lot of instances, you get what you want no matter what the opponent chooses. Sometimes you need more force while you wouldn&#146;t mind retrieving some old friends.<br>
<br>
A mid-game major way to recover is Abyssin Ornament. Its second function is worthless. The reason I say mid-game is because in late game, a major recovery attempt is near impossible with Aim High coming out (or already being out :). If your lucky, the opponent will have wasted all three Defensive Shields (and the effect isn&#146;t out) and you can make one major retrieval in a later game. Obviously you will want a large number of non-unique destroyer droids in your deck to make this effective. I personally play with sixteen and I have, in tournament, made a full sixteen force retrieval for free because my opponent did not have Aim High out.<br>
<br>
[ NOT ENOUGH POWER ]<br>
You should have plenty of power unless you are facing every light side main at one site. First, set up Nute Gunray at the Blockade Flagship: Bridge. If you choose not to start this location, have a few We Must Accelerate Our Plans in your deck. They not only bring out that site, but they pull the other various effects when the time is right. Crossfire should be one of your starting effects. It is pretty much a rule to have at least two (usually three or four) destroyer droids at every location you choose to occupy. Along with that, have at least two force remaining in your force pile or a Combat Readiness in hand.<br>
<br>
[ GUNGAN ENERGY SHIELD ]<br>
This is my favorite scenario. Forget whoever else is there, use Precise Targeting and nail the Fambaa as hard as you possibly can. The last time I pulled this off, I made the Fambaa hit and the opponent lost 7 force. That is one short of a carbon freezing. If it dies, shoot everyone else next battle. If the opponent deploys another one, nail it again! A destroyer droid deck is designed to damage the opponent through weapon damage. If you have a Precise Attack in hand, target a Jedi. If you don&#146;t, just hit and re-hit (yes, that is legal) a low defense character.<br>
<br>
[ RUNNING OUT OF ARSENAL ]<br>
It can be very frustrating to do a count and find out that every destroyer droid you own is deployed or lost. I&#146;ve had this problem, even with my sixteen destroyer droids all in one deck. You have to remember from the beginning not to over-deploy and not make suicidal assaults. Try using the Cloud City Incinerator. By controlling that, you can retrieve one droid per turn by using 2 force (3 if Aim High is down). If you choose, you can also use EV-9D9 to boost force drains there because typically destroyer droids are going to be controlling that site. I usually don&#146;t do this because Menace Fades, Ultimatum, or some other card always stops it.<br>
<br>
[ OPPONENT LOSES ONLY HIT CHARACTERS ]<br>
One thing I always hated was that the opponent didn&#146;t lose too many characters, even though they suffered tons of weapon damage. One solution is Precise Targeting. It states that any hit character may not be used to satisfy attrition. Now, by annihilating some Jedi via Precise Targeting, they can no longer satisfy the five or six attrition you deal them! This way more characters present die.<br>
<br>
((( DECK DESIGN IDEAS )))<br>
<br>
There are an infinite amount of possibilities. I am only going to suggest the few that I like. First idea is to use the lightsaber combat objective. However, your deck will contain little or no Dark Jedi (just because an option is available to you, doesn&#146;t mean you HAVE to use it). The idea is high force activation and high force drains. Also, your destroyer droids absolutely rule at the Generator Core. It sends all characters of ability &lt; 5 to the Used Pile instantly! Technically, your destroyer droids are prone as well. However, with the limitless amount of interrupts at your disposal, it&#146;s highly doubtful the opponent will ever actually get a hit off. By careful selection, you can really pound hard at that site. If the opponent has all characters of ability &lt; 5 present, hit each character one by one, sending them to the Used Pile (and the opponent is still losing force from all this). If you have enough shots left, reduce them to two characters. Use Precise Targeting on either of the remaining characters so crank the force loss before they depart. Then, your power should be MUCH higher than theirs.<br>
<br>
Another possibility is Scum And Villainy with My Kind Of Scum. If you are looking for another retrieval system, this is the way. Destroyer droids have no ability! They do not suspend Scum And Villainy. The only difference is you cannot use Nute Gunray in this case. However, by pulling out Jabba and Bib (use Power Of The Hutt), your battle destinies are ALL +2 (not just the destroyer droids).  This also allows you to use a Krayt Dragon as a protection. Considering how creatures do not attack droids, you will simply rule on Tatooine.<br>
<br>
Dark Deal is harder to balance but more damaging. For one thing, all the locations are pulled for you. Activation is relatively nice. Force drains and power absolutely HURT when it is all set up. Plus, you can simply pull the Incinerator using I&#146;m Sorry. All Too Easy is another rude surprise you can pull.<br>
<br>
Senators is an all-time favorite of some. You can start the Galactic Senate along with the Blockade Flagship: Bridge. The various bonuses added by the senators make destroyer droids even more ruthless. The only downside is once again lost deck space. I much prefer the lightsaber combat objective because I just LOAD the deck with the destroyer droids and all their utilities.<br>
<br>
The major downside to all of these suggestions is that they assume and hope that the opponent will come to the ground. Destroyer droids just eat up mains for breakfast. If the opponent uses a space deck, you are in big trouble. I am currently working a on strategy to combat SOME air at the same time while killing on the ground. My current tactic is using Search And Destroy. Besides that, space is just too rude...particularly a flipping Hidden Base. There are things you can do about certain scenarios, though. See those in part three.<br>
