<br>
This article was written in response to the amount of questions I get at tournaments that centered around how to beat certain deck types. Many players seem to have other players that they just can't beat, and some even have certain deck types that they struggle against. Well despair no longer. This article will outline the most popular Light and Dark side decks, and the most efficient ways to hurt them. That's too much writing for one article so I'm going to write how to beat common dark decks.<br>
<br>
The best piece of advice I can give every player is that when constructing your deck ask yourself these questions.<br>
1. What are the 3 most popular decks on the opposite side?<br>
2. How will each deck stop mine?<br>
3. What do I need to add in to make my deck stronger against these deck types?<br>
<br>
The only other important piece of advice, and this is more towards deck construction is - Maintain Focus.<br>
That is - Focus your deck on how you want to win. A deck that is split between space and ground is very unfocused (This is why objectives that focus on one or the other are dominant). A focus ground deck will beat it, and so will a focused space deck. Therefore if you are making a ground deck, make it focused on the ground, with some space protection, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
The strong/popular deck type I will look at are as follows -<br>
Dark:<br>
Hunt Down<br>
Rallitir Operations<br>
Court of the Vile Gangster<br>
<br>
Hunt Down and destroy the Jedi:<br>
<br>
Possibly the most powerful of all the dark side decks, Hunt Down combines both strength and flexibility. The true damage though comes from the card 'Visage of the Emperor'.<br>
Visage of the Emperor causes both players to loose 1 card at the end of each players turn. With 60 cards in you deck that means the game would be over in 30 of your turns. The problem is most people use half their decks during the game - this means that the game can be over in as short as 15 turns, just from the Visage. This being the case we need to cancel the Visage. Visage is immune to alter so we can rule that out. The only 2 ways to remove it is to a) Control the Holotheatre b) use the interrupt - Transmission terminated. The most popular way is the 2nd one, using Transmission Terminated. This destiny 5 lost interrupt just straight cancels Visage, and I find most people will use 1-2 in their decks. The first one is a little harder. Because their are no light icons on the executor you will need a spy to get there. One of the best ones to use is Boush, mainly because she is flexible in all decks, and because the if the Hunt down player wishes to redeploy the Visage (and most play with 2-3 copies in their decks) then they will need to kill Boush, and that is not that easy.<br>
With the Visage gone - Hunt down just become a focused battle deck, which can be played against like any other battle deck. In other words, expect 5-6 Vaders, his stick, a few Grand Moff Tarkins, AT-AT's and AT-ST's as well as some heavy hitting space ships and some interrupts and effects to back it up.<br>
<br>
Some ways to beat the Hunt Down :<br>
<br>
Profit deck - I suggest using both Boush and 2 transmissions terminateds. Most profit decks tend to be battle orientated, so the destiny 5's are good and can be recycled, and Boush is good on Tatooine. Make sure you have some ways of getting rid of Vader (eg. destiny adders, Sabers). To aid in battleing I would also suggest the effect - mechanical failure, which is an absolute killer on the AT-AT's. Not using Boush then I would suggest 4 transmission terminated's as Hunt down is designed to battle this deck deck and you don't need to be loosing from the Visage the whole game.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base - Since you have very little ground support (maybe epps) I would definitely go with 2-3 Transmission Terminated's. Boush could also be a possibility since she can double as an undercover spy against other drain decks. You may not need a spy however since allot of hunt downs are space orientated and will deploy a presence of the force to Vader's Meditation chamber and put Vader there. This helps their space aspect, but also allows a normal EPP easy access to the Visage, beware of dueling though. Also, The planet that is furthest from card, while stronger against other deck types is still useful against hunt down, since most hunt downs deploy Vader to a site that has a good drain - in most cases, Endor or Tattoine, and most of these drains come from bonus's that are best canceled.<br>
<br>
Ops - Bothawui ops is strong against Hunt Down. The extra destiny on the ground makes it easy to get past Vaders immunity and the mass of bothan spies make it very easy to cancel Visage, watch out that your spy doesn't get beaten up. The best way here is to stock 1-2 undercovers. Deploy the Bothan spy to cancel visage then undercover him to avoid any beat down. Stocking 1-2 Transmission terminated's is also a wise idea.<br>
<br>
Rallitir Operations :<br>
<br>
Rallitir Ops, like Hunt Down is a battle deck. Instead of getting the Visage bonus, it gets to add to its destiny draw in battle and to apply a -1 to all your drains. While this is possibly a bigger advantage, it has 2 drawbacks to compensate. Firstly, it needs to put more cards on the table to achieve these bonuses. Secondly, it generates allot less force, so needs more locations than usual.<br>
The best way to stop the Ral Ops deck is to either stop it from flipping or to flip it back. Unfortunately this usually means taking the battle to Rallitir. The popular start for this deck is Bad feeling have I, making most mains deploy +4. So when choosing your characters, keep this in mind. Some strong aliens like Twass Kha and Melas are good, and some non-main rebels like Orrimako are strong as well. Also beware of the dark side using allot of reacting vehicles. Beezer is good to help combat this.<br>
To flip the objective back you only have to control 2 locations, so this means the system as well. The Tantive 4 can deploy straight there, and don't be afraid to drop it first turn - as this is a sure way to stunt the Ral Ops decks growth. Since some Ral Ops decks don't use any other systems, you may need to add in a system if you are only using the Rebel leaders. Coruscant is always a good choice (especially because of its added deploy cost to your opponent).<br>
<br>
Some way to beat Rallitir Operations :<br>
<br>
Hidden Base - If you can get a spaceship to Rallitir early (turn 1-3) this is a great way to stop them from flipping. Don't forget to back the ship up though. As always watch out for the bounty hunter ships. An X-wing cannon may be useful here, as well as some Intruder missiles against Death Squadron Star Destroyers (and of course Bossk in Bus). There drains should be almost nonexistent on Rallitir, but since you have Planet furthest from in your deck - this is a good precaution. Consider Beezer in your deck as dropping her with some EPP's can really give your opponent a headache.<br>
<br>
Profit Deck - Again the early spaceship to Rallitir is handy - but not necessary. If you can generate enough force you may be able to take the battle to them - Guns and destiny adders can clear Rallitir fairly quickly. Don't be afraid to flip early, even though you might not retrieve anything. Quick strong drains also hurt Ral Ops allot.<br>
<br>
Ops - Sometimes it is best to let them come to you. Rebel Barriers can stop the big guns - and if they don't battle you can usually re-enforce strongly enough, and since you should be getting at least 2 destinies (always protect the operative) and with the recycling nature of operatives, you should have the advantage. What it boils down to is after you both flip - you still have a drain. Beware of Ral Ops decks that play with bright center as the 2 force to get one card means that you will have no drain really quickly. This is where some careful chosen characters held for the right moment should win you the game. Consider using Tantive 4 and or the Redemption (especially when coupled with the Bacta Tank) as this can give you some means to remove Bright center and/or oppose any nasty space drains.<br>
<br>
Court of the Vile Gangster :<br>
<br>
The newest Dark side objective, Court of the vile gangster decks became instant trouble as soon as they started appearing. There are 3 main types, The objective deck (ie. a deck that feeds the Rancor), A Mixed Battle deck, and finally an alien (usually Bounty hunters) battle deck. Although all slightly different, they all play with the same tactics.<br>
The objective draws you to Tatooine by making you loose a force every turn that you don't. Since there is also some strong drains on Tatoine, this can become a problem. Staying in space isn't safe either since the Objective allows them to deploy the Bounty hunter in their ships straight from reserve deck.<br>
Some things to watch out for are :<br>
Trap door - if they have a Rancor on the table, expect this interrupt to be floating around.<br>
Scum and Villainy - coupled with the right aliens, everything deploys cheap and has bonus forfeit, plus the force retrieval keep them going strong<br>
Hidden Weapons - With Fett, Jodo Kast and the Mandalorian Armor equipment - hidden weapons can devastate you in battle.<br>
Bounty hunters with weapons - With 2 capturing hunters be prepared to loose characters<br>
Bounty hunters in their ships - We all know how strong they are, and unless you are playing heavy space - you will need some way to nullify them (or at least their drains)<br>
Search and Destroy - This effect makes you loose force if you don't have a character at a site. Coupled with the objective It can seriously hurt low Character decks.<br>
<br>
Some ways to beat Court of the Vile Gangster :<br>
<br>
Hidden Base - If you are playing with EPP's then you should know how to use them. Best to use them before they can use capturing cards as well.  Undercover spies (eg. Boush) are good but most COTVG decks will have Hutt Smooch in them. Best bet is to probably avoid Tatooine. You must have at least 1 Battleground site in your deck though as Search And Destroy needs to be avoided. You also need some way to get rid of the Bounty hunter ships effectively. There are a few different ways, best to use what works best for your deck. Don't go to heavy on multiples of 1 Type of interrupt as grabbers (ie There'll be hell to pay) are common. Try not to loose your Hidden Base, because once you do they should be able to outdrain you on the ground.<br>
<br>
Profit Deck - Fortunately you won't be hit with the force loose due to not having a character on Tatooine and they can't force drain you in the Audience Chamber, unfortunately they got to start with 2 aliens. Since the common way for you to flip the objective is clearing the chamber, a COTVG will try and stop this, and they should do well at it. Best bet is if you play with 2 or more Leia's is to play with at least 1 'Someone who Loves You', which allows you to free Han, This way you can still get drains on Tatooine and retrieve force. I would also suggest playing with some sense to cancel hidden weapons, and all other nasty interrupts. Disarm, Mechanical Failure and Falling Portal are also very strong in this deck.<br>
<br>
Ops - Unless you have a strong battling deck, you should probably not go to them. You should be able to drain them quicker than they will do damage to you. This means they will most likely come to you. Here you must be wary of your Operatives being captured, because you must obey the 1 operative per site, and the captured one does count. Make sure you have some defense against drain reduction methods. Bright center is used but more commonly it will be Imperial decree.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=629"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=629"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=629" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
