I know I do.<br>
<br>
I want to talk about class in playing.	Sportsmanship.	Having fun, and playing because you love to play.  Too often they are forgotten in the cut-throat tournament environment.  I've always tried to play the fairest that I can, as have most of my friends.  We don't like what we run into a lot at the big tournaments.  We like to interact with our opponents on the table, not just have a drain or insert or retrieval race, you know?<br>
<br>
Class and sportsmanship are so incredibly important, because if you have them, you command instant respect from your fellow players.  I know a number of people who are considered to be excellent players, but aren't respected at all because they're either jerks to play against, or they simply copy other people's decks, or both.  Those kind of people sour the tournament environment, and no offense to any of them, but I'd rather not have to play them.  I could very well beat them, but I doubt I would have fun doing it, and I don't mind losing, but I mind losing to abuse and sore winners.<br>
<br>
I had a breath of fresh air on Saturday at a local tournament that a good friend of mine was running.  During the third game of six that were played, I was paired with a younger kid, about 14 or so, who was playing a Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi deck.  Not remarkable in itself, after all, they're everywhere these days, but it was an original set up, especially for our area.<br>
<br>
It was a close game the whole way.  I had invaded the Executor with about all of my mains and support crew early, hopped over to Tatooine for a couple of battles and then back again.	I was draining there for a couple of turns and he was draining me in space, each of us for five a turn, but he had a bit of a lead on me.<br>
<br>
He could have won.  He could have made it a drain race and beaten me.  But he didn't.	He wanted to end it, either way, on a duel, and left it all up to the destinies.  He had three cards left in his hand, and nine in his life Force, I had two in my hand and five in my life Force.  He put down Vader and Vader's Saber at EPP Obi's site and used Circle to initiate the duel.  One Glancing blow put Vader out of play with Force loss, and he was drained out next turn.<br>
<br>
What kind of guts, what kind of class does that take to know that you could win the game, but to risk it all because it would be fun to duel?  That commands the upmost respect, ladies and gentlemen.<br>
<br>
I don't think that that kind of class or desire to have fun is demonstrated enough these days.  We had to remind a frequent player that 'none of this is real' when he was complaining about how unrealistic it is for Chewie and his Bowcaster to take out Tempest 1.  How can you complain about that?  I'd try to do it just to do it as Light Side, and I'd probably fall out of my chair laughing if my AT-AT got killed like that!<br>
<br>
This game is supposed to be fun, friends.  Please don't ever forget that.  Play with class, integrity, and sportsmanship, and you'll have fun no matter what.  And you'll always be respected.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
