You, staring over the top of your 3 card hand, watch your opponent as he counts the sparse remains of his once august life force in the desperate hope that he did indeed save enough force to deploy, battle, and draw destiny.  You watch him assessing how much force he will lose next turn and evaluating what options a further depleted reserve will leave him.  He examines your demeanor, searching for that glimmer of something that will betray your strategy and give him an advantage.  The timekeeper calls &quot;five minutes&quot; arresting you from your contemplative meditation, and with a hopeful sigh and a silent prayer, your opponent begins to &quot;use the force&quot;.  The dance begins.  It does not end until you reach across the table, shake his hand, and speak those all to familiar words, &quot;Good game!&quot; Only this time you mean it.<br>
<br>
These are the moments that bring us back.  These are the games that we relive for months cursing our lack of vision when it cost us the close game…or praising our great ability when we seize victory from our opponent&#146;s ever tightening grasp.  We all know it too well; for every player within earshot will breathe a vicarious sigh of relief when those fateful words are uttered, &quot;I won by 3.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Losing this type of game eats us up inside.  We analyze those last 3 turns.  What could we have done different?  What play turned the tide?  Was it a mistake on our part or good play by our opponent?  What positive things can we take away from that game?  This is what I plan to talk about in this article in hopes that in the future you might be more mentally prepared for the Endgame.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the Endgame?&quot;  <br>
<br>
The Endgame is the stage of the game where victory is still up for grabs, and every play makes a difference.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, but that&#146;s an entire game of Star Wars!&quot;  <br>
<br>
No.  In the endgame, it&#146;s more potent.  For most of a Star Wars game, you know who is winning-you know who is in control.  Single plays, although important, can possibly be amended later if they don&#146;t work in your favor.  In the Endgame, one misplay can end the whole thing.  And not only CAN they; odds are they WILL!  A better question would be &quot;When is the Endgame?&quot;  Unfortunately, I don&#146;t have a much better answer to that.  The truth is that it changes from game to game.  The Endgame isn&#146;t a time or a turn.  It is a style of play.  It is the change we make to our game when we know we have to lay it all on the line.  It is a game situation.  <br>
<br>
In truth, recognizing the endgame is the first, and biggest, problem that most players have when reaching this stage of the game because the Endgame does indeed require a different style of play.  And typically, the player who recognizes the Endgame first is the player who will survive.  However, for the sake of argument, I put to you that it begins approximately when both players have 15 or fewer cards left to lose.  However, this is by no means a concrete measuring stick.  The Endgame is not something to be defined.  It is a game situation, and you must learn to recognize it.  Recognizing it is step one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, so we&#146;re in the Endgame…What now?&quot;<br>
<br>
In order to succeed in the Endgame, you must know the tools of the craft, and you must realize that in order to win you must sacrifice.  You have to work with what you&#146;ve got.  You have to assemble your toolbox and take it with you into the Endgame.  These are the tools that I suggest you put in your toolbox:<br>
<br>
**An awareness of remaining life force**  <br>
<br>
&quot;Whose remaining life force?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yours and your opponent&#146;s, that&#146;s who.  Remember that your goal in this stage of the game is to have one more life force than your opponent.  You&#146;ve got to do whatever it takes to end that way.  Keep a mental tally of how much force is left in both decks.  If he&#146;s draining you for 6, and you&#146;ve got 15 cards left, that gives you 3 turns.  But, your opponent also has 15 and you&#146;re only draining for 4.  That means you&#146;ve got to find a way to buy yourself a turn.  How do you do this?  Lose battles.  Granted, if there&#146;s a battle you can win, win it.  I&#146;m not suggesting that you should purposefully under deploy to make sure that you lose battles, but if it&#146;s the difference between losing a character on the table and losing two cards from your life force, lose a character from the table.  Remember you&#146;re in a race to see whose ship can sink the fastest…and you want to lose.  So plug a hole here and there and help your deck tread water.  Don&#146;t hold on to those power cards if they&#146;re weighing you down.<br>
<br>
Yes, that&#146;s right.  If you&#146;ve only got 15 force left, and one of them is an Executor in your hand, why are you holding it.  Is there some mystic ability to resurrect force that it has if you hold it in your hand like a scepter?  No!  It seems silly to mention this, but I&#146;ve seen it often.  We&#146;ve engrained in our minds that the Executor, Vader, Luke, Obi-Wan, etc. are power cards and we should hold them to find a way to use them.  However, this mode of thinking is not only wrong, it&#146;s constipated, and if continued, it will limit us throughout our Star Wars career.  You&#146;re not Theodore Roosevelt, so don&#146;t &quot;Walk softly and carry a big stick.&quot;  Not in the Endgame!  Instead, be aggressive.  Border on reckless, even.  Disrupt your opponent&#146;s damage potential at the expense of a character or two.  They might be able to serve you better that way.  It might be that Boba Fett&#146;s finest hour is in his death.  Just salute him as he goes, because he might have just made the ultimate sacrifice for your victory.  <br>
<br>
**An eye for appraisal**<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean by an eye for appraisal?&quot;  <br>
<br>
I mean that you must know, as I have just stated, what the value of a card is.  In every aspect of the game, (not just in the Endgame) the value of a card lies solely in its ability to help you achieve your goals.  Therefore, you play and lose cards based on their value.  For example, if you are playing against a Hidden Base deck and are forced to lose force in the mid-game, you might hold onto Security Precautions in favor of Mara Jade because Security Precautions could be a game breaker for you later.  It is the more valuable card.  On the other hand, if you are NOT playing against Hidden Base, it seems ludicrous to hold that same Security Precautions in favor of Mara when Security Precautions will not help you.  Mara, on the other hand, could be pivotal in dislodging your opponent from a good drain location.  If you see this distinction, you have just exercised your &quot;eye for appraisal&quot; at the most basic level.  <br>
<br>
As the turns go by, you must constantly reappraise the cards at your disposal, because their values change.  In the Endgame, the more mundane mechanical cards (e.g. Ghhk, Houjix, Projective Telepathy, It Could Be Worse, etc.) are often the greatest assets you have.  Yet, many players will lose them anyway, because they aren&#146;t aware of the value of the card.  The taboo that power cards can always win games is completely unfounded.  Sometimes, that Ghhk you just lost instead of the Executor could have been a lifesaver, and losing it--a seemingly excusable lapse in judgment--might have cost you the game.  To succeed, you have to be willing to make those sacrifices, both from the board and from your hand.  Every turn, you must look at the cards available to you and ask yourself, &quot;What can I do with this card?&quot;  If the answer is nothing, pitch it.  That might be the best way it can serve you-to possibly preserve a more useful card. <br>
<br>
**Foresight**<br>
<br>
&quot;How am I going to learn foresight?&quot;<br>
<br>
It&#146;s true, foresight is not something easy to teach or learn, but it is something that you can practice and get better at.  There is a mental process to the Endgame, and hopefully you have been internalizing it as you read this article.  First, you start by keeping a mental tally of how many turns you have and you try to buy yourself a turn here or there.  As you get better at that, you will learn to think of how many drains you can survive, and you try to stop enough drains to buy you that time.  If you&#146;ve gotten to that point, then you must be thinking about how to stop those drains, so you&#146;re looking at your cards and thinking &quot;I can deploy Yoxgit to the Audience Chamber to stop that drain for one turn, but after that I&#146;m going to have to figure something else out.&quot;  If you&#146;re thinking this way, then your next step is to try and keep a handle on the ebb and flow of the force.  <br>
<br>
Think of how much you want to activate, how much you&#146;ll need to deploy, and how much you&#146;ll need to move.  Look ahead two or three turns.  Ask yourself what you&#146;re going to need to stop those damaging drains.  Then, put yourself in a position to win or lose those fights, whichever will serve you better.  If you don&#146;t have enough for everything that you want to do, then explore other options.  The first answer isn&#146;t always the best one. But no matter what you do, you must have a plan of action.  <br>
<br>
**Patience**<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?  I&#146;ve only got 5 minutes left.  I don&#146;t need patience.  I need to hurry!&quot;<br>
<br>
In the Endgame, patience may be the hardest skill to exercise, but I cannot stress to you enough how important a quality this is (in all aspects of Star Wars).  Yes, you might feel that clock bearing down on you, but you must weigh the alternatives.  If you take your time to do this right, there is a possibility that you might get a timed loss.  But what might happen if you rush?  You could very easily get a full loss, instead.  And believe me, the latter is much more probable than the former.  Think things through.  Having a feasible plan of action is absolutely essential to winning in the endgame.  It will not only save you mistakes, it will save you time because you will have a clear idea of what it is that you want to do.  <br>
<br>
Impatience causes us to commit ourselves to strategically disadvantageous positions.  Nobody with any experience in the game will refute that good players willingly enter into strategically disadvantageous situations, because they lead to defeat.  So, why would we voluntarily enter into those situations when we know that they lead to defeat?  It doesn&#146;t make sense.  You must play smart to win, and in order to play smart you must think things through.  Therefore, you must be patient.  If you believe you&#146;ve explored all of your options, take a few extra seconds to look again.  Too many times, I&#146;ve watched players hasten to beat the clock; but in so doing, they beat themselves.  Slow it down.  With so much added weight on every move, you should never make an ill-advised decision.  Patience is a must.  Fight the urge to hurry.<br>
<br>
**Timing**<br>
<br>
&quot;Timing!  That&#146;s another one I can&#146;t learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, it is true that this is one of those tools that is hard to acquire if you don&#146;t already have it.  However, if you are internalizing the Endgame mode of thought, you can learn it, too.  If you see that you can only survive three more turns of drain while your opponent can only survive four, you know that you must buy yourself one turn.  The rest is arithmetic.  You can wait one or two turns to make your move.  You only need to buy yourself one turn and you have three turns to live.  Three minus one equals two.  However, you must also be aware of the pressure your move will put on your opponent.  That is the real key to timing.  The better you time your actions, the more likely you are to win.  <br>
<br>
Timing is a good quality to have as a Star Wars player.  In many arenas it is an art that separates the best from the good, but for the most part, it is a combination of all of the tools listed above, so I will not talk about this anymore.  Just remember that if you have applied the correct value to every card, have a plan of action, and have the patience to think things through, you will put yourself in a position to best react to your opponent and will be more likely to create opportunities for your victory.  Essentially, that is timing.<br>
<br>
**Confidence**<br>
<br>
&quot;How is confidence going to help me in the Endgame?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the most important too.  Confidence helps a player in all aspects of his game.  I believe every player should know his strengths and weaknesses.  Your play style reflects how you perceive yourself.  And knowledge of your game helps you to grow.  Many players beat themselves when a match-up is not to their favor-either versus tough decks or tough opponents.  Players who believe in their own abilities have an immense advantage over less-confident players, because they are not afraid to take a few risks.  They are more adaptive.  You can&#146;t prepare for every eventuality, so don&#146;t try.  Instead, be prepared to react to what you&#146;re opponent gives you.  Remember that it is not your cards that beat your opponent; you beat your opponent.  <br>
<br>
You are the final tool, and you must have faith in yourself.  If you believe that you can outplay your opponent, you can.  There are no match-ups that you cannot win.  However, if you believe that you cannot outplay your opponent, than they have already outplayed you…the rest is just a matter of course.  Have confidence.  Know your strengths.  Match those strengths to your opponent&#146;s weaknesses.  Victory awaits you at that intersection.  That confidence reflects itself in your play, and it will steal victory from your opponents many times.  Find this confidence for yourself and you will find yourself much more successful.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay!  We&#146;ve filled our toolbox, so we&#146;re prepared for future closely contested games.  What happens after the game is over?&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, be a good sport.  Nobody likes a sore loser.  We like opponents who gloat even less.  Reach across the table and shake your opponent&#146;s hand.  Congratulate your opponent on a well-played game.  Tell him that you look forward to a rematch.  Ask if he&#146;d like to trade.  Remember that we play Star Wars for fun and to interact with people.  Exercise every opportunity to do both.<br>
<br>
Next, keep an open mind.  Talk to your opponent about the game.  What did he do that beat you, or what did he do to lose to you?  What did you do to beat him, or what did you do to lose to him?  There is no teacher like experience, so learn from the game.  Think about those last turns and how they played out.  Did everything work out as you had planned?  Why?  Why not?  Remember what you did right, and correct your mistakes for the future.  Next time, you will be better equipped to succeed.<br>
<br>
Finally, enjoy the moment.  It WAS a good game.  You both played incredibly well, so there is no reason for anybody&#146;s ego to be crushed.  Remember that Star Wars is just a game and, regardless of the outcome, you&#146;ve both just participated in a game that you will remember for a long time.  You competed admirably, and that&#146;s all you can ask for.  Take that with you when you go and tell your friends about it.  That&#146;s all you really can do.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah…and report the outcome to the Tournament Director.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won by 3!&quot; You state proudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoo!&quot; He sighs listening to your results, &quot;Good game!&quot;<br>
<br>
