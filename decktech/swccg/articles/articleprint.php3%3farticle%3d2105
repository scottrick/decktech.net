TRACKING DESTINY<br>
Tracking desiny is a simpile concept. By keeping a few simple numbers in your head, you can draw high destiny in nearly every situation in the middle to late game. there are three distinct methods of tracking deatiny.<br>
The frist way of trakeing destiny is using traffic control for light side and reactor terminal termal for dark side. this effect allows you to put any or all cards from your hand back in to your used pile during your control phase. Using this method you can put otherwise useless high destiny cards back into your deck, and draw them later in the game.<br>
The second way of tracking destiny is very similar, but avoid the use of aforementioned effects altogerher. by using five or six-destiny used interrrupts that have other udeful functions other that recycling bakc in to your deck. Examples of the cards are out of commission, shocking infomation, the single for light and Dark moneurvers, twi&#146;lek advisor and masterful move for dark. another way of tracking destiny is someting used in conjention with the above methods in order to ensure you counted correctly. check  the game text of all cards on the table. do any of them allow you to search your reserve deck for a card? id so, perform that action during your turn after activading most of your reserve deck, even if you are positive the card you are searching for is not in the remaining cards. that way, you can check your reseve deck to ensure the cards you have left are high destiny and you can then procced to battle freely.<br>
