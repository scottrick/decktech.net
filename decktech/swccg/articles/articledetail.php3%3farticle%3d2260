And yet, is the card more effective than it looks?  The answer is no.  But nevertheless the card is more useful than other choices out there, and can be a good backbone for some alternate deck styles.<br>
	First, let&#146;s look at the real costs involved.  It&#146;s a destiny 5 effect that must deploy on a Star Destroyer, and only if you have out five Executor sites.  A fairly tall order.  This of course means that you&#146;ll need to also have a system out to deploy the star destroyer.  Commander Merrejk is a great character for this, and can also help you deploy the galaxy to drain at.  Getting back to the ships, the best Star Destroyer for this deck would clearly be Flagship Executor, since when targeted it not only makes the Effect immune to Alter,  the ship becomes immune to attrition.  You don&#146;t want to go to this much trouble only to have everything destroyed because of an Alter or a good destiny draw.  <br>
	But of all the restrictions by far the largest is the Executor sites.  Getting five out is going to be a tall order, which means that you must have Commander Gherant from Dagobah.  Commander Gherant lets you get one Executor site every turn for two Force during your deploy phase, which means you can get one the turn you drop him if you have the Force.  Commander Gherant can be pulled out by Admiral Piett, who can in turn be grabbed by Imperial Command, a powerful interrupt in its own rite.  So getting the Commander on the Executor isn&#146;t going to be a problem. (I suppose I shouldn&#146;t say that you have to use Gherant, but he&#146;s the best choice.  An alternative would be to play several Uncertain Is The Future in the style of the How Did We Get Into This Mess decks, but as a lost interrupt it&#146;s not very good.  Gherant is far better.)<br>
	A good start might be to include Imperial Arrest Order and Mobilization Points.  You can pull out the Flagship Executor (or not.  A destiny four or five ship isn&#146;t one you&#146;d mind stacking multiple copies of in your deck) and pull out the Executor: Docking Bay on the first turn, and you can deploy Gherant to the Docking Bay for an extra two force activation.  Even if they&#146;re playing Watch Your Step you&#146;ll still be activating enough to get started; all it will do is stop your extra generation at the Docking Bay and decrease your Meditation Chamber from two to one force.  The force choke is one of the nice parts of this deck.  You can go several turns without giving your opponent a single Force while you set up.  <br>
	You do want to get set up as fast as possible with this deck, but there are different options available.  One of the most frequently mentioned is using the Hunt Down objective, since you get to start with two of the five sites in play anyway.  The other side benefit is the confusion that you&#146;ll create.  The disadvantage is the Visage of the Emperor, which will be hurting you during all this.  My biggest fear with this type of Flagship Ops is running into an opponent who pulls out Honor of the Jedi, which means that I would need to play No Escape to get around it until I get completely set up or I&#146;d only be hurting myself.  You could put in several Vaders and an extra docking bay to flip the objective, but now you&#146;re starting to throw in more and more cards.  What you need to ask is: Is all this space worth the one turn it&#146;ll save me?  Probably not, but if you want to play a Hunt Down deck with Flagship Ops on the side it might be something to consider.<br>
	As I said, Hunt Down is a choice to use for the deck style, but it is by no means exclusive.  You could use Bring Him Before Me as your objective.  This would continue the force choke aspect of the deck while giving you destiny adding ability and taking cards out of circulation with Insignificant Rebellion.  Another choice would be going with constructing the second Death Star.  Since you&#146;re already doing space decks anyway, Death Star II can be put to use against your opponent with its direct damage.  Also, you would already have a great drain system (Endor) on the table to deploy your Flagship Executor to.  The disadvantage would be getting only one objective, which should probably be Imperial Arrest Order to get out the Executor: Docking Bay early on.<br>
	It&#146;s important to keep the Executor sites in mind during construction, since they are no different then any other sites.  Most important to remember is that the Holotheater and the Meditation Chamber allow a drain of two, so it&#146;s important to consider having a beatdown group ready or be standing by with a Come Here You Big Coward to slow down their drains.  An alternative is to not play with the Holotheater and put Vader down at the Meditation Chamber.  This way this drain 2 site is defended and he can apply his ability towards battles at systems.  The Comm Station allows you to move ships to Executor&#146;s location as a react, but only if you have an admiral there (or Tarkin or Piett).  Personally, it&#146;s not worth wasting a character twiddling their thumbs at this site just to be able to react.  The last site to consider is the Control Station.  Be very concerned about the light side text: if they control they can take the Executor joyriding, which isn&#146;t good.  On the plus side, you can put an imperial leader there to make the Executor +5 or +6 power, which can be an important difference if you&#146;re facing Dash and the Outrider.  If you&#146;re using the Imperial Command-Admiral Piett-Commander Gherant method of getting sites out, you could move Gherant and Piett over to the Control Station to add the power, but Piett could be more useful someplace else (like on the Executor itself allowing it to draw a battle destiny).  However, you could use the Imperial Command to pull General Veers or General Tagge (both imperial leaders) and deploy them to the Control Station.  With Gherant they can draw a destiny and you can use Imperial Command if your opponent drops down a spy to attack you there.  Gherant, as forfeit 6 thanks to Imperial Arrest Order, can take up all the attrition then.<br>
	So you&#146;ve got your five sites out, your Flagship Executor and Flagship Operations in hand, and you&#146;re ready to deploy to this system.  Deploy away?  Not unless you feel lucky.  There is one card that is played often enough that will absolutely kill you if timed right, and so you must be ready: It Can Wait.  Yes, your opponent says your Flagship Ops can wait a turn, and now you have this ship sitting at a battleground with no immunity to attrition and nothing else to forfeit because you&#146;ve used up all your Force this turn.  Attrition of 1, and it&#146;s bye-bye Executor and all those Executor sites and all the cards at those sites.  Basically, bye-bye deck, bye-bye game.  Will this happen?  Not often, but if it does it will be a devastating loss.  The safest things to do would be to: deploy to a non-battleground (still danger from Tantive IV and a beatdown crew, but it&#146;s far less likely that things will go so perfect as to have It Can Wait and Tantive IV in hand at the same time and enough pilots ships for a destiny draw and just happen to have the 3 force ready), or save some Force to deploy extra ships or pilots there to be forfeited instead.  Bettter to lose a Thrawn or Vader then to wipe out the all the work of getting this stuff out.  Of course, the simplest answer is to just check your opponent&#146;s hand and see if they have it, using one of the many cards available for this task.<br>
	Okay, all of this has been set up, but we haven&#146;t really gotten to how to use Flagship Operations.  The benefit to all of this work is to make our TIEs deploy -1, forfeit +2, and destiny +2.  Also, wherever you have a TIE you add one to each battle destiny; it&#146;s like having a Darth Vader at every system!  So one of the most obvious uses for Flagship Ops is in a TIE deck.  Sienar Fleet Systems would obviously work well in a deck like this, and All Power To Weapons would be a must.  Matching TIE pilots might be something to consider, if combined with Fighters Coming In.<br>
	Your TIEs have better destiny and your TIEs add to your destiny, so clearly destiny draws are going to be important.  First a way to add destiny: I Can&#146;t Shake Him adds a destiny whenever you fire a starship weapon, and it lets you pull out starship weapons to put on them.  TIE Interceptors with SFS Laser Cannons can be killers since they can fire for free, and they fire twice (a single TIE Interceptor can add 5 to total power with Crossfire just by doing this).  With the Flagship Ops out TIE Interceptors are destiny 4, which isn&#146;t bad at all.  But let&#146;s say you like really big destinies.  How about playing Planetary Subjugation and Bombers?  Planetary Subjugation adds 5 to the destiny of all TIE Bombers, making the Bombers destiny 5 and the Scimitar TIEs destiny 7 (this from several tournament directors; don&#146;t rate this low because you disagree please).  Now, put out Flagship Operations and your TIE Bombers are destiny 7 and your Scimitars destiny 9!  And don&#146;t forget to add one to each battle destiny.<br>
	One of the other benefits of Flagship Operations is that your capital starships are deploy -3 where you have a TIE.  A few Star Destroyers as back up couldn&#146;t hurt, especially Death Squadron Star Destroyers, which if you have the Executor and a TIE together deploy for 4 force to that system.  Dreadnaughts deploy for 2 and add 1 to the power of each TIE, although they lack any immunity to attrition.  Because of the way the deck works so well with fighters and capital starships Battle Deployment might be a consideration.  R2-A5 could also work well in this capacity.<br>
	People put up these impossible scenarios in these articles all the time, but here&#146;s an example that I think is pretty reasonable.  You&#146;re playing Flagship Ops with a BHBM start, using IAO, MB, and Planetary Subjugation.  Emperor and Emperor&#146;s Power are running, and at Kashyyyk you&#146;ve got Admiral Chiraneau piloting a Death Squadron Star Destroyer.  You also have a Scythe Squadron TIE there.  Opponent deploys Dash, Outrider, Captain Han, Falcon, and Leia with Blaster Rifle.  He attacks.  You play All Power To Weapons and it&#146;s grabbed.  You lose one off the top of your Reserve Deck to add a destiny.  Your Star Destroyer&#146;s power is reduced by 6.  You play Imperial Command to limit your opponent to one destiny.  Your opponent pulls a 5 for destiny.  You pull an All Power To Weapons (destiny 4) and Scimitar Squadron TIE (destiny 9) and add 1 to each.  Your total power is 24 with 15 attrition, your opponent&#146;s is 18 with 5 attrition.  You lose your TIE.  Your opponent gives you a card and tries to decide what to forfeit.  Whatever the case, Superfalcon will be broken if not gone.  In total, you&#146;ve lost three cards (the All Power To Weapons, the one off the Reserve Deck, and the TIE, assuming you don&#146;t have Sienar Fleet out) while your opponent has to forfeit three, plus lost their grabber, plus the card they gave you.  Next turn you either drain for your 3 at Kashyyyk or drop two TIE Bombers and crush the remaining forces.<br>
	Or, for those who like the unlikely scenarios, you also have out Crossfire and instead of a Scythe you have a TIE Interceptor armed with the SFS Laser Canon, and Thrawn is the Admiral on board.  Same situation, except you use 3 force to target Outrider, hit and remove it, play I Can&#146;t Shake Him, and then fire again at the Falcon for 0 force (and miss).  You draw 4 destinies which are all Scimitar TIEs.  You now have 40 attrition and a power of 60 to your opponents 18.  Opponent loses Superfalcon and 22 force.  There, the wet dream is over, back to the article.<br>
	The problem with Flagship Operations is that it does take a few turns to get set up and is a bit force intensive early on, and it&#146;s very difficult to balance between space and ground with this deck.  The best choice, to me, is to include an Arica or U-3PO (or both) to hurt their ground drains and focus on space.  Flagship Ops takes a while to set up, but in the right deck can give you a force that will rule space without question.  <br>
