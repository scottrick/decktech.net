I actually haven't read most of them, but I wanted to give my perspective on tournament etiquette.  I don't expect extremely high ratings, so please be patient and read what I have to say.  It would be incorrect protocol to review an article before you've read it, justifying your actions by saying 'It's been done before!'  I have not read an etiquette article in over three weeks, so I think that I won't be writing and using other people's material.  If I have, I apologize profusely.  Another thing: I don't think these guidelines work as well at huge tournaments, such as Invitationals or Worlds.	These ideas are for local tournaments, where most of us go.<br>
<br>
	In your first tournament, did you have a bad experience?  Did a player put you down for playing a specific deck type, or insult you constantly during a game?  Did they act haughty, as if they had a superiority complex?  People who act in a smug, prideful manner are not fun to play against.  If you are new to the game and to the tournament scene, may I apologize for all of us.  At many times, experienced players, including myself, do not even realize that we have insulted or offended other players.	However, there are simple ways to improve your attitude and actions without sacrificing your desire to win.<br>
<br>
I believe the most important rule of tournament etiquette is (yes, you guessed it) the Golden Rule:  'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'  Would you want to be insulted by a more experienced player?  No.  Try not to bring them down (only in their attitude, you still try to win), but build them up, that they might learn from the experience and become a better player.  If all players followed this simple rule we would see a dramatic rise in SWCCG players, which is good for everyone.<br>
<br>
Your attitude before the game will dictate in many ways what your actions will be like during the game and after the game.  In my opinion, no one person can ever go into a game assuming he will win without a fight.	It has the possibility of happening, but assuming you will win shows through your speech and actions, and it hurts inexperienced players.  On the same accord, you can never assume you are going to lose.  I have seen players make grave errors in gameplay against me because they believed they were going to lose.  The message to new players:  don't give up!  Before a game, do not brag of your achievements or super decks, but just be happy, show a smile, say hello, shake your opponent's hand, and make your opponent feel comfortable.  Answer all questions your opponent asks you.	For instance, during one tournament I was to play a newbie who didn't have many cards.  He asked me how many cards I had.  I said 'I have complete sets of every expansion plus all the premiums.'  He went 'Wow!' and I raised the intimidation factor without even offending him.  Now let the games begin. . .<br>
<br>
During a tournament game, any player's objective is simple: to win.  Although you want to have as much fun as possible, or to learn from your more experienced opponent, the focus is to win the game.  For some players this means that you make the opponent angry and insult him to gain the advantage.  However, this is unnecessary.  At many times just seeing Luke, Obi-Wan, Leia, and Han on the table is intimidating enough; you don't need to add insult to injury.  For the experienced players, don't deceive your opponent.  Answer his questions honestly.  When you play lesser known interrupts, don't say 'do you know what this does?'  That tells an inexperienced player 'you don't know anything.'  Play everything normally, letting them ask what things do and what you are doing.  If you treat them like they are worth something, then they come to respect you.  New players, don't be sore losers.  If your opponent does something you dislike (such as a huge beatdown or something), please don't get mad, and don't provoke your opponent into doing something neither of you would want to admit to later.  The guy I mentioned in the previous paragraph made some serious mistakes during the game, and his deck was very weak.  However, during the course of the game, as I beat down his characters and Tempest Scouts, I never made him feel stupid or dumb unless he called himself those names.	I don't think he had a bad time playing me.<br>
<br>
So now the game is over.  Congratulate your opponent regardless of whether you win or lose.  Say 'Good job, I enjoyed playing with you,' or something that shows you had a good time.  Be a good winner.  Answer any questions, say thank you' for compliments, don't demean your opponent, and don't insult his intelligence.  Another key action is not to try to explain everything to your opponent.  Do not show why he lost or what mistakes he made, unless he asks you.  There is nothing worse than having a loss rubbed in your face.  In addition, don't be a sore loser.  You can talk about the game, but don't get angry.	At the most, tell him you'll get him next time.  Then smile and say 'good game!'  You will get another chance.<br>
<br>
This is all I have to say.  I sincerely believe that all tournament players will have more fun if everyone is sportsmanlike to each other and not belittling.  I hope all of us can become better at SWCCG and at being good sports.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
