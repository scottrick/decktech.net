<br>
Initiate for free, I retrieve one, you lose one.<br>
<br>
Pay three for a drain of two.<br>
<br>
The above are all commonly heard phrases in SWCCG games everywhere. Yet they are overlooked more often than they should be.<br>
Forgetting the functions of certain cards can have an incalculable impact on the way a game of SWCCG turns out. The negative consequences of absentmindedly overlooking a card, action, or phase can be (and often are) greater than what is immediately evident. Not only can such forgetting result in a negative gameplay situation for the player who does the forgetting, it can create unnecessary stress on his opponent, who is faced with a difficult decision: remind his opponent of his error and incur adverse effects in the game; or let the incident go, and risk looking like a bad sport should the opponent later realize his mistake.<br>
Therefore we should all strive to remember every little action during our turns  and our opponents. We should take into account every card on the table in every action we perform. We should thoroughly examine the game text of every card played so that we know how each card affects the others on table.<br>
The problem here is time  to look at every single card on table before performing each of our actions would consume more time than is allotted for tournament games. To that end, the following list of key game aspects is presented. The authors hope is that, in reading this list, players will remember each of the listed actions/cards in every game they play. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive  it does, however, contain many common mistakes as well as cards that are commonly seen, yet also commonly forgotten.<br>
<br>
1. Force drains.<br>
I will not spend much time on this, as force draining is, to most of us, second nature. Unfortunately, many (if not most) new or inexperienced players can forget to force drain during their control phase every now and then. And most expert players, in all honesty, must admit that they have forgotten to force drain in a game at least once before as well.<br>
The solution? Not immediately evident, and possible solutions vary from player to player depending on personal style. A tactic that was of great assistance to me in my early days was to play with a copy of the rulebook (Glossary nowadays) facedown in front of you. Refer to it continuously throughout your turn, noting each phase and what you can do in each. Perhaps even scribble in force drain next to control phase, as that is perhaps the most important action that takes place during that phase. This tactic also has a secondary benefit  the fact that you will have a Glossary by your side to refer to throughout the game. That is always beneficial.<br>
And work on your patience. Its easy to get caught up in the deploy-and-battle action of SWCCG, especially when you have a hand full of mains ready to jump a couple weak characters the opponent has left undefended. But this aint Young Jedi. Take a breath, and take your turns phase-by-phase. Have patience, dont get ahead of yourself.<br>
<br>
2. Visage of the Emperor.<br>
Ok, on to a more advanced topic  Visage. I personally hate this card =P but its all over the place right now, with Hunt Down being the most popular Dark Side objective.<br>
Unfortunately, Visage can create some very awkward situations.<br>
For example: in my last tournament, I was in second place after 4 games, lost my fifth to drop to third, then was paired up against a Hunt Down deck in the last game. I still had a shot at the tourney if I played well enough in the last game.<br>
Well, the game was a close one, and I couldnt seem to draw any of my Transmission Terminateds. My opponent flipped his objective on his second turn, and I was the only one losing to Visage. At the end of one of his turns, he drew, looked at me, and said, Your turn. I knew I was supposed to lose to Visage, yet he hadnt brought it up. I reached for my Reserve Deck slowly, giving him a chance to mention Visage, but he didnt. So I started activating. By the time I had activated four force it hit him, and he said, Lose one to Visage.<br>
Now I was in a sticky situation because my opponent had forgot about his own card. I didnt want to baby him and voluntarily lose one  but then I didnt want to look like a meanie for intentionally forgetting.<br>
The solution to this is actually simple. Hunt Down players  know your damn cards! With Hunt Down being so popular, there are many players of varied skill levels who play the objective, and some of them simply overlook its true power. To Hunt Downers of all sizes and skill levels: dont play a deck unless you are going to use the cards properly. Youre better off playing a different deck that you are more familiar with. You will save yourself the grief of performing poorly because you forgot certain cards, and save your opponent the grief of being placed in an uneasy situation.<br>
And as a final note, because there is no way to prove that the LS player genuinely forgot to lose Visage, or forgot on purpose, it is the DS players *responsibility* to ensure that force loss from Visage is satisfied. Plus, the DS player is the one actually playing with the card.<br>
<br>
3. Opponents effects<br>
On to bigger and better things	its also very important not to forget the effects that your opponent has deployed. They can often benefit you as much as, if not more than, your opponent.<br>
Two prime examples of this are:<br>
Battle Plan/Order. If your opponent has deployed one of these, make sure hes obeying it! If he doesnt fulfill the battleground site/system requirement, make him pay for his drains! This is especially important as some players may forget (whether intentionally or 'on purpose) to pay for their drains. If you dont remind them, theyre getting away<br>
How do you remember? This is a tougher situation, and as with most situations the best solution is experience. The more you play, the more you will become accustomed to playing under the conditions of Battle Plan/Order  two very popular cards.<br>
Another possible solution is to adopt a highly inquisitive attitude when playing. Such an attitude is positive in almost every aspect of the game, and it really comes in handy in this situation. A player with such an attitude is wary of losing force at all, and wants to know the cause for every force loss he is required to undergo. Such a player looks for ways to evade every force loss inflicted on him; and Battle Order/Plan is one way an inquisitive player might avoid force loss from drains.<br>
	Also:<br>
	Draw Their Fire/First Strike<br>
When your opponent deploys one of these effects, an alarm should automatically go off in your head. They truly are game-changing effects, and should be treated as such.<br>
These effects are often deployed by a player before he is about to initiate a battle, or series of battles. However, as there is no way to cancel them, they remain on table for the rest of the game, giving both players a chance to capitalize on them. The important thing is to not forget about them.<br>
How do you do this? Well, again experience is the best teacher. After your opponent initiates three battles in a row and gains a six-force swing in his favor through the effect, you are unlikely to forget about its presence! However we have not all had this experience.<br>
To best remember DTF/FS, you must make a mental note of it when it is deployed. Look at it as a positive effect on the game, as a way for you to retrieve cards. Adopt it as part of your strategy, as if it was your own card. It can be just as helpful for you as it can be for your opponent.<br>
<br>
There are many more effects that are often overlooked by both players, including Goo Nee Tay/Bad Feeling Have I, Pride of The Empire/Legendary Starfighter, Order To Engage, etc. Yet the following rule can apply to every effect your opponent deploys: make sure it is deployed on the table in a place where it can be easily viewed by both players. Try not to overlap your effects, and if your opponent does so kindly request that he spread them for easier viewing. Clear the playing area of all bags, binders, etc. so that nothing can be covered up. And check regularly on the effects that your opponent has deployed. Think about how they can affect your strategy and the current game situation. Often players deploy effects that have no bearing on the current game  effects that are only in their deck to counter other deck types. Disregard those effects. But make sure you can distinguish the more relevant effects from those that are not impacting the game.<br>
Finally, let us examine the oft forgotten:<br>
<br>
4. Generic sites<br>
I sense the reader tiring from the length of this article, so well wrap up with another short segment. Generic &lt;&gt; sites are used in many different decks...Ops, Throne Room, ISB, etc. However, their game text is another element of the game that can be easily ignored.  The player using the sites is the one likely to benefit from their text  the sites can provide him with immunity to attrition, increased drain, discounted deploy, and other benefits, while afflicting his opponent with reduced drain, reduced attrition, and increased cost to battle. These are all little tidbits that can add up to a lot.<br>
To remember what each of your sites text says, read it quickly to yourself as you deploy it. Both sides. These cards arent toilet paper, both sides have a use. This will give you a general idea of what card you have deployed, and what it does. This is especially important when it comes to generic sites, as they can easily be mistaken for one another. To this day I dont know which site is the Jungle and which is the Swamp without reading them (except I know the Swamp is the one that allows deployment of creatures from RD ;-). After you have deployed the site, glance at it quickly every time your opponent performs an action there, or right before you perform an action there. This will keep you from passing up the game text, and help you to reap the benefits the sites can give you.<br>
<br>
So thats it for now. As I said, this article is far from exhaustive, one could write a thousand articles on not forgetting stuff. Hopefully the little Ive written has helped spark some thought and helped prevent the reader from committing some serious mistakes in SWCCG.<br>
