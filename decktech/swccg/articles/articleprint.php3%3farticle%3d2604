As with almost every other organization out there, there&#146;s some controversy as to whether this is a good organization to contribute to. I&#146;d like to explain my reasoning for picking PETA. <br>
<br>
    I like animals. I always have. I have never understood how certain kids in my neighborhood growing up could pour gasoline on a turtle and light it on fire, or kick dogs or throw rocks at cats. Behavior like that has always pissed me off. For myself, I simply HATE to see an animal suffer. The way I view it, it&#146;s not the INTELLIGENCE of the animal that&#146;s in question, it is it&#146;s capability to suffer. <br>
   <br>
    One of the most infuriating things that I hate is needless suffering, and coincidentally enough, one of PETA&#146;s biggest goals is the elimination of animal testing. Animal testing benefits us, right? We&#146;re making huge strides towards wiping out AIDS by testing on animals, correct? Wrong. <br>
<br>
&quot;...human-based research is far more likely than animal experimentation to produce findings about HIV and how it infects humans. To date, critical insights into AIDS disease mechanisms and therapy have derived exclusively from in-vitro and in-vivo studies of humans. In contrast, animals infected with various immunodeficiency viruses consistently fail to faithfully reproduce the human AIDS syndrome.&quot;  <br>

<br>
    Granted, this is only discussing AIDS research. This does not cover animal research being done for Cancer or other diseases. So, I tried to find arguments supporting Cancer research using animal experimentation. After 15 minutes of straight searching, I gave up, finding nothing that specifically showed that animal experimentation was benefitting Cancer research. That&#146;s not to say it&#146;s not out there, it&#146;s just saying I couldn&#146;t find it. You would think something that important would have lots of proof backing it up, but I couldn&#146;t seem to find any. Oh well. Maybe someone else can. <br>
<br>
    At this point, I realized I can sit here and throw quotes at you all day long, and it&#146;s not really going to make a difference. There is arguments for both sides of the fence here. (Albeit I found a lot more on the Con side than I did on the Pro side). And although I found the Pro-Animal Experimentation arguments weak and shady, it will still come down to the individual&#146;s opinion. Just like Abortion, this is one of those issues where you will NEVER have everyone agree. <br>
    <br>
    So, once again, why did I pick PETA? PETA has made much progress in reducing the suffering of animals in all kinds of areas, mainly in food production. And although they have gotten some bad press, this does not mean the organization as a whole is flawed. I like them because they are actually doing something, instead of sitting around with their thumbs up their ass.<br>
<br>
    There is an old saying: Try to please everybody, and you&#146;ll end up pleasing nobody. Despite this, I&#146;ve always tried to stay middle of the road, not offending anyone (at least not TOO much), and just writing basic articles, and only slightly tasteless humor. Well, with my decision to support PETA, I&#146;m obviously not going to make everyone happy. That&#146;s okay, I can deal with it. Just realize that it&#146;s ME that&#146;s supporting PETA here, not Decktech. If you have a problem with PETA, then simply don&#146;t participate in the drawing. Don&amp;#8217;t blame the site for it, and write crap articles denouncing Decktech. It&#146;s my charity. Not Decktech&#146;s. And although I&#146;m sure there is a lot of charities out there that nobody would object to, I wanted this one, despite the problems some people would have with it. <br>
<br>
    Oh, and by the way, all you hunters and fishers out there: Although I don&#146;t really have serious problems with hunting or fishing, how can you call it a &quot;sport&quot;, IF THE OTHER SIDE DOESN&#146;T KNOW THEY&#146;RE PLAYING?!?!? <br>
