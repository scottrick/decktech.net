Jeroen Webb<br>
Destiny 2<br>
Rebel<br>
Spy<br>
Power 1 Ability 2<br>
Deploy 2 Forfeit 4<br>
Text: Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots. When in battle with a Rebel leader, subtracts 1 from opponent&#146;s total battle destiny.<br>
<br>
A low deploy high forfeit Rebel spy pilot that can subtract from opponent&#146;s battle destiny? Cool. I immediately put him in my deck, and he hasn&#146;t come out since. You see, in every LS deck I&#146;ve ever created, I&#146;ve included Jeroen Webb. He&#146;s always been useful. Maybe it&#146;s also a sentimental thing, but he&#146;s definitely useful. I&#146;ve been questioned and ridiculed and such for always having him in the deck... Jeroen&#146;s been considered useless, outdated, and other things. I&#146;ve written this article to prove a point, he does have this uses. And the difficulty here, is that unlike the Tatooine Utility Belt, you can&#146;t use his destiny for a lot of tracking uses.<br>
<br>
By the way, Insurrection makes him forfeit 6, the combo version forfeit 5, keep this in mind.<br>
<br>
100 Uses For Jeroen Webb<br>
<br>
1. He&#146;s a spy, infiltrate the Desert Landing Site.<br>
2. He&#146;s a pilot, try letting him pilot Home One.<br>
3. Good destiny... for Alter.<br>
4. Let him pilot a Rebel Snowspeeder.<br>
5. Try infiltrating the Blockade Flagship Bridge (with a Jedi, too, of course).<br>
6. 3 words: Toilet paper substitute.<br>
7. Deploy him alone, opponent deploys load of characters, battles, use Houjix and grin.<br>
8. Need a third pilot on Radiant VII? He&#146;s your man.<br>
9. Cancel Visage with him.<br>
10. His destiny is also good... for Sense.<br>
11. Let him make an Attack Run, blow up the Death Star with him!<br>
12. Good for race destiny... when you have A Step Backwards in hand.<br>
13. Try training him on Dagobah. Ability 5 Jeroen!<br>
14. Let a Vine Snake attack him, have a good laugh when he dies that same turn.<br>
15. He&#146;s a better pilot for Chewie&#146;s AT-ST than Chewie himself!<br>
16. What about piloting a Cloud Car?<br>
17. Let him ride on a Tauntaun and keep reacting away from battles.<br>
18. Let him drive Kalit&#146;s Sandcrawler. Bet you&#146;ve never seen that before.<br>
19. Let him ride a Lift Tube and Life Tube Escape from all his battles.<br>
20. Use him as a pilot aboard the Liberty.<br>
21. Let&#146;s say you want to waste time in a game, maybe stall. When he&#146;s piloting the Liberty, forfeit the Liberty to Used Pile. Put Jeroen in the Used Pile also. If the opponent doesn&#146;t notice, cool, if he does, he&#146;ll argue that you can&#146;t do that. Then  you argue that you can, indeed, do that. Then the argument will go on until someone calls the tournament director for a ruling. Then you can both argue with the tournament director. Then when the director makes his ruling, keep arguing with him. When the director leaves, grumble and mumble under your breath and generally keep a bad attitude. Take Jeroen into hand. If the opponent doesn&#146;t notice, cool. If he does, he&#146;ll argue that he goes to Lost Pile. You argue that he goes to hand, why would he be lost? He shouldn&#146;t be lost, keep insisting that he should go to Used Pile no matter what your opponent or the tournament director thinks. Keep arguing, until the tournament director is again called over. State your case again to the director. When he makes his ruling that Jeroen goes to Lost Pile, keep arguing. When the director leaves, mumble and grumble and insist that he&#146;s wrong and generally keep a bad attitude. Hopefully, you just wasted 10 to 15 minutes or more of game time.<br>
22. Need another pilot for Gold Leader In Gold 1? Guess who&#146;d be perfect.<br>
23. Let him pilot a ship as insurance against Zuckuss In Mist Hunter.<br>
24. Need to get in the Bunker quickly? Infiltrate it with Jeroen.<br>
25. Lando In Millenium Falcon needs a co-pilot. Badly.<br>
26. Perfect forfeit fodder aboard Outrider when Dash and Leebo are already piloting.<br>
27. Actually, Jeroen&#146;s a better pilot on the Outrider than Leebo. Leebo&#146;s text still applies as a passenger.<br>
28. Deploy Brainiac. Opponent groans. Sigh and deploy Jeroen instead. Opponent gets a puzzled look.<br>
29. Deploy Jeroen with Caldera Righim in front of a bunch of DS mains. Jeroen&#146;s just begging to have the crap beaten out of him, just teasing the opponent, maybe even frustrating him.<br>

35. Play an Operatives deck on Ralltiir. Deploy Jeroen and claim that he&#146;s a Ralltiir Operative. When opponents says that he isn&#146;t, you say &quot;Well, he should be, read his lore.&quot; Then, while the opponent is reading his lore, steal his cool cards without him noticing.<br>
