But for those of you who think star wars is dead......<br>
<br>
   I dont think star wars is fading on the horizon like star trek is. I think wizards of the coast will cry after there new swccg game doesnt sell, because i think that there are many die hard swccg fans out here who love and will continue to support decipher and there game.<br>
<br>
   Swccg is so awesomely different than any other ccg game out there. It is so diverse, it really is like playing a game of chess with a million pieces. You have endless options and deck designes to sift through. We will never get tired of making new decks with old tech, or old decks with new tech.<br>
<br>
   I have talked to so many cool people here, and based on that alone, swccg will not die. Swccg is immortal.<br>
<br>
   So lemme here a big f**k yeah for swccg and all of the cool geniuses who play it!!!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
