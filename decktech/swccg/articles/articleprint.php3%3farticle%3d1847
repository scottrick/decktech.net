<br>
Contrary to popular belief the Brownie isnt a brownie at all! That&#146;s right. The Brownie is actually a chocolate cake sunday. Yep...its got chocolate cake with chocolate icing, vanilla ice cream, whip cream, nuts, hot chocolate syrup, and it used to have a cherry(@#$%s at the gay denny&#146;s got rid of them though).<br>
<br>
Now that you know exactly what the Brownie is I can explain the proper usage(or eatage if you will) of the Brownie.<br>
<br>
The Brownie should be eaten the night before a big tournament in which you hope to perform well. There are very specific luck factors that come with eating the Brownie...here are some quick rules for eating the Brownie<br>
<br>
1. never, ever let somebody else eat part of your Brownie<br>
2. always eat the entire Brownie...even if you&#146;re full halfway through<br>
3. if you&#146;re new to the Brownie or you think you can&#146;t eat it all don&#146;t order one. ask your friend for a few bites<br>
4. always have a friend to also eat the Brownie...it doesnt work if you&#146;re alone in eating it<br>
5. if someone offers to pay for your Brownie...let them.<br>
6. you never ever ever say you want to order the Brownie...you always pick up the menu and point to the Brownie saying, &quot;two of these&quot;<br>
7. the Brownie should be given the utmost respect. it should always be capitilized when writing. Should anybody disrespect the eating of the Brownie they should immediately be made to leave the table and should not be allowed back until they&#146;ve been made to suffer the indignity of going to denny&#146;s alone to eat the Brownie.<br>
8. never, ever eat the Brownie with people who ain&#146;t in your circle<br>
9. if possible, try to regurgitate the Brownie immediately after consumption<br>
<br>
Now I can explain why these rules are the way they are.<br>
<br>
rule #1...when somebody else eats part of your Brownie they steal your luck...not only do you lose luck from them eating part...now you&#146;ve broken rule #2 as well. not only that but you have to pay for it when you&#146;re done. now you&#146;re paying full price for half the Brownie you ate. on top of it all...your friend has eaten your luck and he doesnt have to pay a dime. while it may not seem so because you ate more than him...he will do better than you the next day because he comes away with more positive luck than you.<br>
<br>
rule #2...eating only part of the Brownie is absolutely the worst idea. if you cant eat the whole thing dont order one...you&#146;re better off...you lose so much luck by breaking this rule.<br>
<br>
rule #3...this rule is sort of the same as rule #2. but eating only part of your friends Brownie is great. you get all the luck and you dont have to pay...what more could you want?<br>
<br>
rule #4...if you&#146;re alone at denny&#146;s eating the brownie then you&#146;re a @#$% and there&#146;s no hope for you anyway...so feel free to break this rule<br>
<br>
rule #5...you get the whole Brownie and you dont have to lose the luck by paying for it...you&#146;re a shoo in for worlds<br>
<br>
rule #6...this is the almighty of tech right here...if you say, &quot;we want a Brownie,&quot; you will lose! i am the sole owner of this tech and any improper usage will result in immediate legal action.<br>
<br>
rule #7...this one explains itself...if i have to tell you why you aren&#146;t worthy of eating the Brownie.<br>
<br>
rule #8...trust me.  it doesnt work.  you gotta keep it on the inside.	inviting competition to eat the Brownie with you only decreases your chances of winning.<br>
<br>
rule #9...i didnt come up with this one.  props to matt sokol for inventing a new rule.  trust me...it works.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that you know how to eat the Brownie, you&#146;re well on your way. All you have to do is go out and &quot;Eat the Damn Brownie.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Is the Brownie really gonna help you qualify for Worlds?<br>
<br>
Absolutely not. In and of itself the Brownie is nothing more than a tasty treat at a less than average restaurant.<br>
It won&#146;t make you win any games(gasp).<br>
<br>
What the Brownie does do is more important than all that. Its from the school of positive thinking. If you convince yourself that the Brownie is helping you it probably will. This is because you are playing with more confidence. Its all about confidence. So eat the Brownie...but don&#146;t just eat the Brownie...believe in the Brownie...and you&#146;ll soon be on your way.<br>
