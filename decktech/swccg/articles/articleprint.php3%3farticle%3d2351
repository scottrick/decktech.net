<br>
TOPIC 1:<br>
How to fight a SYCFA deck.  A couple of weeks ago I recieved a d-mail asking how I fight against a SYCFA deck.  I would like to share with you my techniques and obeservations on fighting against a SYCFA deck.<br>
Generally a good start involves using Aim High.  Most players should have already discovering what a benefit this card is.  It slows down the retrieval a lot by making it almost twice as expensive to deploy and retrieve.  It also can destroy the late game retrieval by making it too expensive when force becomes low and the dark side player needs to deploy, move, or draw.<br>
One of the major keys to beating a SYCFA deck is to go the death star sites to drain as early as possible.  If you are running a light side space deck then go to Weekulmui as early as possible.  Spread out early on the ground except if you are faced off against a Brangus Glee, or Scum, variation.  Brangus Glee decks usually start some card which lets you see that it isn&#146;t an average tie deck; i.e Power of the Hutt, No Bargain, etc. or they may pull a system other than Weekulmui.<br>
Versus all swarm type decks (non-unique aliens, ties, etc.) I use my grabber on the first Nar Shadda Wind Chimes, Short Range Fighters, or equivelant card.  Usually people only pack two or three of those cards and you might be able to counter all of the retrieval they would do with that single card.  Especially if you get good drains in because they may lose all of their copies.  If you can make them lose part of their retrieval engine, you can really hurt them.  You can beat a SYCFA deck in a drain race if you spread out to all of your sites and to the death star sites.  It helps to have I Hope She&#146;s Alright on the ground.  Remember that the light side can drain at the Death Star sites just not the dark side player. <br>
Holding the Death Star docking bay is part of the key to beating a SYCFA deck.  You can hold the Death Star docking bay if you have one of three cards; First Strike, Order to Engage, or are playing TIGIH.  If you have one of those cards then it hurts the dark side player to deploy to the Death Star with anything and they will most likely try to avoid it.  They usually try to put the Emperor down at the Death Star and if you have guys then they can&#146;t.  Sometimes there is a Vader with saber in those decks though so have a barrier.  If there is a Vader then usually he is the only one that you will see if you can kill him.<br>
A few manuevers is BIG for the Falcon to prevent it from being shot down.  If you&#146;re playing a deck that relies on the Falcon, play with this card.  You can also put Corran Horn into your starfighter to add to its manuever.  <br>
If you do want to play with them early, GO TO WAKEELMUI.  The squadrons become pretty expensive at that point, and totally stops the beatings they can lay on you.  They will try to boot you out but you are delaying their game plan (draining), and using their force so they can&#146;t draw ties.  If they don&#146;t boot you out, don&#146;t be afraid to go to space with other forces now because their cards are expensive, but don&#146;t play the spread game to thin...particularly if they start saving up force.<br>
I have seen a lot of decks start packing Surprise Assault because the Ties generally have low power and with WYS that card can be played more than once to do lots of damage.<br>
Seth Van Winkle had a Tie deck that he said never lost until I played him. I followed the tips above and I put up a little bit of a fight in space and I was able to defeat him.  <br>
<br>
TOPIC 2:<br>
How I prepare for a big tourney.  With my states getting nearer and the Vegas DPC coming up I think this topic is pretty timely.  I have a few ways that I get prepared for big tourneys that I can share.<br>
<br>
1. Starting with the easiest thing, I buy new sleeves for big tourneys.  I do this so that I don&#146;t have to worry about some rules rapist trying to say that my sleeves are marked because they have gunk on them or are wrinkled.  I also do this so that the opponent can&#146;t look at my sleeves and see that they are different.  <br>
My favorite example of this is when I played Josh Kohman.  He had his Vader in the lost pile and I played Out-Of-Commision.  I looked at his Vader and I noticed a wrinkled edge on his sleeve.  Then when he shuffled his lost pile I could tell which card was Vader and I put that Out of Play.  If you don&#146;t want something like that to happen to you then have new sleeves. <br>
2. I use white border for all the Premiere cards in my deck.  I search my reserve deck a lot looking for things.  While I am searching I look to see what cards are in there so I have an idea of what is in my force pile.  If you have all your Premiere in white border it really makes it easy to notice what Premiere are in your reserve and which are not.  I usually don&#146;t remember all 60 cards in my deck when I search through my deck but making some stand out from others makes it easy to make that memory connection.  Try this one out for yourself. <br>
3. Deck Construction.  This is the meat, potatoes, and stuffing of preparing for a big tourney.  What decks to choose and what cards to put into them.  I have to be truthful and admit that I can&#146;t give you any general tips for constructing a deck that does well at big tourneys.  That topic covers normal deck construction, meta game preparation, knowledge of the current hot decks, anticipation of what is metaing against those hot decks, originality, and trying to throw something in that is your own personal style. <br>
Notice that I said you had to anticipate the current hot decks. That means you have to try to set your deck up to counter the current popular decks.  Give yourself a better than fighting chance against the deck that you think is the most popular.  Then once you have done that, you need to prepare your other deck to counter the decks that people are going to try to use to meta against that hot deck.  What I am trying to say is that you need to think in two different ways; what are people playing? and how are people doing to try to counter that?  In big tournaments you have to answer these questions more generally than for local tourneys.  In local tourneys you have a feel for what people are playing.  You know the players and you know the styles.  For big tourneys, you don&#146;t know the players and you don&#146;t know the styles.  But you can prepare for the decks and answer the above two questions.<br>
In the current game environment if you don&#146;t have an answer for WYS, Hunt Down, and ISB then you aren&#146;t going to do very well.  Don&#146;t ignore what is popular and just think that people won&#146;t play with it because everyone else is countering it.  Someone will play that deck against you.<br>
You also need to anticipate decks coming at you from left field. There is always someone trying to throw a monkey wrench into the tournament by playing something off the wall.  Matt Sokol&#146;s Hidden Inserts threw a monkey wrench into Worlds.  At the DPC, I knew someone would try to play Ralltir Ops even though Ounee Ta kills it.  I also knew that most people would not pack Ounee Ta and so that Ralltir OPs player would do well and I would have to face him.  It just happened that Jonathan Chu was playing Ralltir Ops.  Put some thought into deck types like those.  How does your deck do against Ralltir Ops, Dagobah Train, Inserts? <br>
One thing I can tell you from my own experience is that any card in your deck that is just in there because you think it is &#146;fun&#146; needs to come out.  Look at my old BHBM deck that is on Decktech.  I have an Imperial Code Cylinder in that deck and I admit that it was a mistake to put that in there.  I thought it would be fun to play with it and I would have been better off to play with a Force Lightning instead.  At the last Gen Con I substituted Vader,DLOTS for all of my Lord Vaders because I thought it would be fun to choke some characters with DLOTS ability.  That cost me Gen Con because in two different games I lost about 30 force to Uncontrollable Fury.  I though it would be fun to play with those cards and it cost me games.  I hate to break it to you but if you want to win big tourneys you have to sacrifice some of your &#146;fun&#146; cards.  Be honest with yourself when you choose a card.  Is it in your deck because it is the best possible card choice or is it in there just because you really like it?  Sure I really like 4-Lom with Concussion Rifle and I think he is the Character of the Year.  He just doesn&#146;t belong in some decks and I have to take him out.  My SYCFA doesn&#146;t have him. <br>
<br>
I playtest.  This is pretty obvious huh?  Doing well at big tourneys means playtesting.  Sure I can sit and think through every card in my deck but until I sit down and play that deck, I don&#146;t know how it actually is going to perform.  Everyone should know that you have to play SWCCG to get better at it. <br>
I also try to go with what I know in SWCCG.  I playtest a deck until I am comfortable with it.  I try it out against various decks and I think it through.  I then use that deck at the big tourney.  I don&#146;t change it the day before or wait until the night of the big tourney to make it.  Graham Neal, Jim Li, and Josh Kohman all slap their decks together the night of the tourney.  I think this is a mistake.  Graham Neal always goes away from the decks he has been playing for weeks and chooses something new right before a big tournament.  This is a recipe for disaster.  Why do you think he always chokes at the big tourneys?  Play with what you know.  Play with decks you are comfortable with.  Preparation is a key to winning.  Sometimes your familiarity with your deck will pull you out of match ups that you should lose just because you know how you have to play in those games.<br>
<br>
Playtesting means playing OTHER decks too.  Think about decks you haven&#146;t played with or against much, slap the deck together (with proxies if needed) and play yourself with it and play other people.  This will give you a better understanding of the deck and how to beat it.  I know I can win matches that I probably shouldn&#146;t because I think like if i was him, what would I NOT want my opponent to do? and the easiest way to do that is to have some experience with the deck.<br>
<br>
4. Talk to other players.  This is another key to winning at big tourneys.  Talk to other players about your decks and about what kinds of decks you will face.  Send your decks to someone and have them look them over for you.  For states I would choose a few people to playtest against and talk with and try to keep my decks quiet agianst everyone else.  I would also talk with players outside of my state to see what they think of my decks and my strategies.  Don&#146;t be afraid to talk to people about SWCCG.  If they play the game they will enjoy talking about it.  I recommend Hayes Hunter.  He always seems to like to talk SWCCG and always has good ideas.  There are lots of other people on Decktech that are willing to share ideas and all that is standing in your way is one d-mail to that player.  If you want to do well, don&#146;t hesitate to ask.<br>
<br>
5. Use your resources.  Go to Decipher.com and check out stuff. Go to Decktech.net and look over stuff.  Come to http://www.mucking-@#$%ic.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi and ask me (or someone else I suppose) some questions.<br>
<br>
TOPIC 3:<br>
Tracking and Stacking.  Tracking is important to the game of SWCCG and everyone tries to do it.  How do I do it?<br>
Now I will have to admit at the outset that I am no tracking genius.  I don&#146;t track five different cards in my deck at the same time.  I don&#146;t track my opponents cards either.  And to tell you a secret, I don&#146;t do anything really fancy to track.  What I do is all in deck construction.  I set aside a certain amount of slots in every deck to have recyclable high-destiny cards.  I shy away from using too many of the same kinds of cards because if they get grabbed they won&#146;t recycle very well.  I also shy away from ones that require certain other cards to be deployed in order to use them.  If you can&#146;t get that certain card than they don&#146;t recycle very well. <br>
Prepare your deck beforehand to help you track your cards.<br>
So how do you get the card to start tracking?  Well first you can draw one of your easily recyclable cards and play it.  Second, you can draw a high destiny card in battle or for any kind of action. Now you can count your reserve and see if you can activate to that card next turn.  If not then I usually abandon trying to track that card.  I usually don&#146;t try to expend the mental effort to try to track through multiple turns.  If you can activate to that card then just count up your reserve and keep that number in mind.  You add the number of cards that get put on your used pile on top of that card.  Then activate that number of cards.  Isn&#146;t that easy?  That is my simple and not so tricky tracking method.  Yet it doesn&#146;t stop there. <br>
I also try to plan my decks to give me enough activation to get to those cards.  If you are stuck with a deck that only activates seven force a turn then you have to do tracking through multiple turns.  I hate multi-turn tracking.  It is more important for me to be thinking through my turns and watching what my opponent is doing than keeping track of numbers in my head.  So I plan my decks to activate almost my whole reserve near the mid game.  That is more than 12 or 13 force I usually try to give myself.  With an adequate amount of force activation you don&#146;t need any sneaky tracking methods to draw high destinies on a regular basis. <br>
I also don&#146;t recommend wasting time tracking.  Don&#146;t take five minutes trying to set up some tracking scheme or trying to keep numbers in your head.<br>
<br>
Stacking is something that is related to tracking so I will mention it here.  For me stacking high destiny is all done in deck construction too.  Many people try to insure they have a high-destiny average in their decks so that any blind destiny draw is still high but how do you do that without loading your decks up with 7 destiny unrecyclable cards?  How do you help yourself get a high destiny draw when you are drawing blind?<br>
Using the same deck design strategy I stated above I set aside slots in my deck for multiple easily recyclable high-destiny cards. The same slots that can help you track can also help you draw a high percentage of good blind destiny draws.  When I draw a high destiny card I play it.  I use Mirax or Janus to recycle it.  I use whatever means I have to put it back into my reserve, even when I am not planning on tracking it.  I do it at the first opportunity that presents itself.  Don&#146;t hold on to that card even if you might use it in the future, unless it is something that might be really important to hold on to.<br>
One game that happened not to long ago is an example of card stacking.  I played an Operational As Planned and then put a 5 destiny card into the force pile right before I payed for something.  That put two 5 destiny cards right together in the reserve.  I couldn&#146;t activate to them next turn so I used a different card to look through my reserve.  The first card on my reserve was a 1 destiny Vader.  I then shuffled my deck and I lost the ability to track those two 5s.  But I knew that even though those cards were now randomized that I had a better chance of drawing a 5 destiny than I did before.  When I battled I drew a blind 5 for destiny. <br>
At the end of most games I can look through my reserve and see all high destiny cards with a few low ones that have snuck through.  The low destiny cards have come out of the deck throughout the game while the high destiny cards have been put back.  In the old days this same effect was done with Reactor Terminal and Traffic Control but now you don&#146;t need such crude recycling techniques.  You can place some useful recyclable cards in your deck and save yourself those card slots. <br>
Putting high-destiny cards in your deck may seem like a no-brainer.  It should be but it isn&#146;t.  If you do it correctly you will draw high-destiny when you shouldn&#146;t and draw even higher when you should. <br>
There is always the poorest of the poor mans tracking techniques.  You can activate all but 1, then search for a docking bay.  Do you have a high-destiny in there?  If so you just did a kind of tracking, I guess.<br>
I have also heard of a method that Hayes uses to track. Basically, you just keep a long string of numbers in your head.  It might be one of the most complex ways but it can lead to some very advanced tracking, and can be very strong when perfected. Here is what would happen normally for me with my Hidden Mains deck (keep in mind that this is just an example): <br>
Ben Kenobi is on the table versus 4 Stormtroopers. LS activates 10, deploys Mirax Terrik to the same site as Ben K.  That&#146;s 2 force.  Use Mirax text to put a destiny 7 card back under to draw one up.  Use Fall Of A Legend.  Now you remember 6, 3, 7, because there is a destiny 6, then 3 cards, then a 7.  Count the number of cards in your reserve deck.  Lets say there&#146;s 8 in there.  So now the string of numbers in your head is 8, 6, 3, 7.  Now it&#146;s 8 cards, a 6, 3 cards, a 7.  You battle using one force.  They play Trooper Assault, but you cancel with Throw Me Another Charge.  Now you remember 8, 6, 1, 6, 3, 7.  You activate 8 next turn, On The Edge for 5, activate one more, Off The Edge for 5, activate 3 more, and On The Edge again for 6. Sounds VERY hard to do, but once you get used to it, remembering that string of numbers is not too hard.  You might want to ask Hayes though because its his method.  That is as much as I know of it.<br>
