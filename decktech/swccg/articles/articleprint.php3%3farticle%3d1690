<br>
NOTE: This is an updated version of my previous article. I tried to address some comments and I included some stuff that I missed. I also reworded my false information about Jedi Test#6 so that it is TRUE now.<br>
<br>
This article is intended for people who are unfamiliar with or need/want help improving their MWYHL deck. It is meant to be an insightful article, and will provided many tips to building a MWYHL deck that will suit your needs and pleasures.<br>
(MWYHL = Mind What You Have Learned / Save You it Can  - Jedi Testing Objective)<br>
<br>
This has been divided in Separate parts for Easy Reading.<br>
PART  I - The Jedi Tests<br>
PART II - How Do I Build My Deck?<br>
PART III - Key Concepts and Combos!<br>
PART IV - The Match Ups<br>
<br>
<br>
PART I -- First lets look at the benefits of Jedi Testing.<br>
Upon Completing Jedi Tests the apprentice gains bonuses. Each of these bonuses is of great help against ANY deck type that you may face:<br>
* Jedi Test #1 - All opponent's Force drain bonuses everywhere are ignored.<br>
* Jedi Test#2 - Apprentice is power +1 and may move normally. Total ability of 6 or more is required for opponent to draw battle destiny<br>
* Jedi Test#3 - You may subtract 1 from each of opponent's destiny draws.<br>
* Jedi Test#4 - Once during each of your control phases, you may use 2 Force to search your Reserve Deck and take any one card you find there into hand. Shuffle, cut and replace<br>
* Jedi Test#5 - Reveal the top two cards of your Reserve Deck and place one upside down on apprentice. Whenever you are about to draw a card for destiny, you may instead use the upside-down card (which remains on apprentice for re-use).<br>
* Jedi Test#6 - Add one battle destiny in every battle. Also, target is immune to attrition &lt;5.<br>
As you can see none of these bonuses would hinder you in any way. But Lets look at them a little more closely.<br>
<br>
Jedi Test#1 - It is not very often when you will encounter a deck that does not use Force Drain Bonuses. Completing this Test alone could be a game saver. You no longer have to worry about those Nasty Decks that Force drain for 10 a turn because of bonuses.<br>
<br>
Jedi Test#2 - This is the Light Sides Equivalent of Zuckus in Mist Hunter, EXCEPT this is much better! This affects the entire table. Your opponent must have at least ability 6 to draw a battle destiny ANYWHERE! This is my favorite of them all! Your opponent so often forgets about it.  When He plays his locations with only 4-ability you come down and do a quick beat-down. Also, All personas of the apprentice have gained a power, so even if you want to replace you apprentice, they are Power +1 Too.<br>
<br>
Jedi Test#3 - Subtracting 1 from ANY destiny you want is like playing God. You don't always have to do it either. You only do it when you want. Those nasty Battle Destinies and Weapon Destinies are now less devastating.<br>
<br>
Jedi Tes#4 - Once you complete this test you now have the ability to take any card out of your reserve deck into your hand for the low cost of 2 force. This works WONDERS with Traffic Control. You can now track any Destiny you want. Easily and simple.  Pull out R2 in R5 and cycle it back into your used pile right away. You don't even have to show your opponent which card you took out. You can also pull out any card you may need for an up and coming battle such as a Character or a Weapon, and even a Devastating Effect. My favorite is &quot;It's Worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jedi Test #5 - The God of all Jedi Tests. If you've tracked your Destiny Correctly, you could have a 7 destiny whenever you want one. This isn't just for battle Destiny and Weapon Destiny, It can also be used for &quot;On The Edge&quot;, or anything else that requires you to draw a destiny. What makes it more versatile is if you track &quot;Artoo in Red 5 &quot; you now a have 7 or 0 Destiny (Your Choice). You can now include other cards that require low destiny such as Nabrun Leids, Sense, and Alter.<br>
<br>
Jedi Test #6 - This test give you the ability to add an extra battle destiny in any battle. So now a Lone Character can be a powerhouse. Just Think of EPP's. You have tracked a good Destiny Number, lay Down EPP Leia, EPP Han, or EPP Obi. Now you get extra Battle Destiny and they can ANYBODY with their weapons. Suicide Mains has never been easier. Also, Your Apprentice is now Immune to Attrition &lt; 5. Whether you trained Leia or Luke, Now you can use their EPP Character for quick &amp; fun beat-downs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART II - How do I Build My Deck?<br>
<br>
Well First, you need to decide what you want your deck to do. If you build it correctly, less than half of your deck will be dedicated to Jedi Testing and the rest will be up to you. Here are a few ideas:<br>
1. You could go with a Super Beat-Down crew.<br>
This usually consists of lots of EPP Characters and Cloud City Ground Sites. The EPP's are used because of their built in weapon characteristic. Usually 2 or 3 of each character is included. Cloud City is used in combination with Insurrection. These two work perfect together, because now your opponent can't Elis Helrot to you because you are at Interior Sites. One of the best sites is to use is Cloud City: Lower Corridor because you can normally Force Drain for 2, and each of your characters with a lightsaber is power +2. Here's a Madman Combo. Jedi Luke, Luke's Lightsaber, at the Lower Corridor = Power-10, Abilty-6, Immune to attrition &lt; 6. He's HOT!<br>
<br>
2. You could use the &quot;Super-Falcon&quot;<br>
Super Falcon is a Falcon with Crazy Destiny Adders. Usually works like this, Gold Squadron 1, General Calrisian, Nien Nunb, Captain Han, and Leia w/ blaster rifle. With Han and Lando Piloting you now have a Ship that is Power-9, Immune to attrition &lt; 4, and Draws 4 Battle Destinies (5 after Jedi test #6). You can also use Destiny Adding interrupts such as  &quot;I know&quot; and &quot;Punch It.&quot; BUT BE CAREFUL: The Dark Side can cause you to be able to draw only 1 battle Destiny (7 -Side of Endor Ops and Imperial Command).<br>
<br>
3. You could play Space/Ground attack.<br>
This can be complicated because you don't want to spread your forces too thin. You may want to include 1 or 2 systems where you can drain hard at (Kessel, Kiffex, or Coruscant), and a site or two (Cantina or CC: Lower Corridor). You may also want to putin some weapons to help you out, (Lightsabers, EPP's, Intruder Missiles, Enhanced Proton Torpedoes)<br>
But make sure you use the proper ships for the weapons you choose. Enhanced proton Torpedoes are good against That Things Operation (TTO) decks. Intruder Missiles work good with B-wings against Star Destroyers. If you're playing space, a good Defensive card to put in is &quot;Star Destroyer!&quot; and &quot;Hyper Escape&quot; for those Just in Case moments.<br>
<br>
4. You could also sit back and play Defense.<br>
Playing with Sense and Alter can be hard, but it could be VERY helpful. If you track &quot;Artoo in Red 5&quot; to use on Jedi Test#5 you'll be all set. No matter what character you have on the table you will win because you can pull a 0 every time. Other Cards that will help you play defensively are Surprise Assault, Imperial Barrier, It Can Wait, and It Could Be Worse.<br>
NOTE: You cannot play &quot;Surprise Assault&quot; if you play &quot;The Way of Things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once you've decided what type of deck you want to play, You need to decide whom you want to train and how far you want them to train to. If you want to train to Jedi Test#6 then you must train either Luke or Leia. Also note that you must train either Luke or Leia to get the Bonuses from MWYHL. Otherwise it has no affect on your Jedi testing.<br>
<br>
Luke vs Leia - 95% of the time you are going to train a Skywalker. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Luke will let you get his saber out quickly using Son of Skywalker (SOS), but you cannot use Jedi Luke until after you have completed Jedi Test #5.  But if you train Leia you can now use Jedi Luke wherever you want, except Leia Can only be trained using MWYHL if you use the Daughter of Skywalker (DOS) persona. Using DOS also limits your capabilities with the super falcon (One less Battle Destiny).<br>
<br>
Starting Cards -<br>
  MWYHL, Dagobah, and usually &quot;Heading For the Medical Frigate&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heading For the Medical Frigate&quot; -<br>
 You will want to start this card so that you can get out 3 effects that will help you tremendously. Those 3 effects are going to be &quot;Wise Advice&quot;, &quot;The Way Of Things&quot;, and &quot;Your Insight Serves You Well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wise Advice&quot; - This card is out mainly because it helps your training Destiny.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Way of Things&quot; - This card help you complete Jedi testing Faster. (Discussed Under Combos)<br>
<br>
&quot;Your Insight Serves You Well&quot; - This is a throwaway card usually.  You send it to your lost pile to search your reserve deck and get a Endor or Death Star II Effect. Most of the Time it will be there for you to get<br>
&quot;Honor of the Jedi&quot; or &quot;Battle Plan&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Honor Of The Jedi&quot; - This helps protect you against Bring Him Before Me (BHBM) and Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi (Hunt Down) decks. Pull First Turn Using &quot;Your Insight Serves you well&quot; if playing against BHBM or Hunt Down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Battle Plan&quot; - Pull this card to help protect against fast early drains. Your opponent will opt to deploy rather than use his force for Force Draining early in the game.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the Edge/Off The Edge&quot; - This can be used as a retrieval engine. If you've stacked a 7 on Jedi test 5 you know that you can retrieve 6 cards every time you play that interrupt. BUT BE CAREFUL: Your opponent has a few cards that hinder your retrieval efforts. &quot;Come Here You Big Coward&quot; says that you must occupy at least 2 battlegrounds or you cant retrieve. &quot;Something Special Planned for Them&quot; Says that after you retrieve cards with that interrupt, it must be placed out of play. &quot;Secret Plans&quot; says you must Use X Force before retrieving X Force. Be mindful of these anti-retrieval cards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yoda's Hope&quot; - This is a good card to have in this deck because the Objective lets you pull it out of your reserve deck and it adds 1 to your training destiny. It's as simple as that<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke's Backpack&quot; - Definitely have this card in your deck. It has multiple Bonuses. It adds 1 to your training destiny when Yoda is aboard. It also allows Yoda to move with apprentice. This is 1 less force you have to spend/save.<br>
<br>
Should you use &quot;At Peace&quot;?<br>
  I Usually Don't. Here's why. If your average destiny in the Deck is high you shouldn't have a problem because you have so many training destiny adders. Even against Broken Concentration this deck usually has a high enough Average Destiny to complete all tests.<br>
<br>
&quot;Polarized Negative Power Coupling&quot; and/or &quot;Traffic Control&quot;<br>
  These two cards are very important. They both help you track your destiny by knowing what cards are where in your used pile.<br>
<br>
Don't forget to include Your Mentor and your Apprentice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART III - Key Concepts and Combos!<br>
<br>
&quot;The Way of Things&quot; - This card says that as soon as your apprentice is present with Jedi Test #3 it is complete. TECH: Deploy Jedi Test #2 on the Dagobah Jungle. Once you complete Jedi Test #2 on the Jungle, Deploy Jedi test #3 and it is immediately completed. You can now Deploy Jedi Test #4. This helps you complete 2 Jedi Tests in 1 Turn. NOTE: After you deploy Jedi test #2 your opponent does have the option to move it, so this Combo does not always work.<br>
<br>
&quot;On The Edge/Off The Edge&quot; = Retrieval Engine (See Note Above)<br>
<br>
<br>
Super Falcon = Gold Squadron 1 + General Calrisian + Captain Han + Nien Nunb + Leia w/ Blaster<br>
<br>
Super Duper Luke = Jedi Luke, Lightsaber, at Cloud City: Lower Corridor = Power-10, Ability-6, and Immune to attrition &lt; 6.<br>
<br>
Deadly B-Wings = Blue Squadron B-Wings + Intruder Missiles + High Avg. Destiny Deck = Dead Star Destroyers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kal Fal'n Cindros&quot; = This could be a cool combo! Reducing your opponent's destiny is awesome! But be careful here. Her Game-text *ONLY* works if you both draw only 1 battle destiny. So if your going to draw more than 1 or you fear your opponent drawing more than 1 battle destiny, then this card may be useless, or even a hindrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anger Fear, Aggression&quot; = AWESOME COMBO! This is an awesome effect to play at anytime during the game. This is an insert that when revealed, Your opponent must start a battle this turn or loses 4 force. What makes it so great is that during the beginning of the game you are on Dagobah, and he will have to come to Dagobah to fight you, which by that time it has usually popped up already. Or After Completing Jedi Test#5 He will not come to fight you because you usually have stacked destinies and he'll just lose the 4 force.<br>
<br>
&quot;Projection of a Skywalker&quot; = This could be a key card in the beginning of the game. If your opponent comes out with quick and early drains you may want to have this card in your deck to reduce those drains. I personally feel that Quick/Early drain decks are this decks worst enemy.<br>
<br>
Completed Test#5 / Weapons = If you use weapons in your deck you now have a guaranteed draw to kill anybody/anything including the Grand Daddy of them all, The EXECUTOR!<br>
<br>
<br>
PART IV - The Match Ups<br>
<br>
Vs Ralltiir Operations -<br>
      Against this Deck you'd be better off playing a MWYHL Beat-down deck on the ground. Get Out Early. Do your best to keep them from flipping. You best bet is to be trying to control the system.<br>
<br>
Vs Set Your Course for Alderaan - Flip -<br>
   You're definitely going to want to go Head to head in space with this deck. It'll be fun and it will be the best way to flip. This is usually a slow deck (Not Too slow, but Slow). So you will have enough time to complete your tests and Send Your Space Cowboys out herding the Imperial Cattle!<br>
<br>
Vs Set Your Course for Alderaan - No Flip -<br>
   This is usually a manipulation Deck. Usually doesn't have too much space protection. Don't Bother Going down to fight them on the Death Star (That's what they want you to do) Do your Best to head for the Death Star and Start Draining There! If you can get Courscant out you could get a quick hefty drain going fast!<br>
<br>
Vs Bring Him before Me -<br>
   This Deck puts a hamper on your Jedi Testing if you are training Luke. It isn't worth training Luke up to #6 against a BHBM deck because even if you do complete this test, you are still captured. So leave him on Dagobah. If Your Training Leia, Jedi test #6 should be no problem. Just don't let them Convert Luke. Get Out Honor of the Jedi first turn and don't let your opponent occupy 3 battlegrounds. You're task against this deck is to kill Vader with out giving them Luke.<br>
<br>
Vs Endor Operations - No-Flip -<br>
 This is usually a TTO deck. They will come out with a Tie Beatdown on the Death Star II.  They will also try to drain big on Endor. Leave the Death Star alone unless you have Proton Torpedoes, because they will build it fast and they will protect it well. Send the Beatdown crew to Endor to Destroy Army on Suicide Runs. Realize too that this deck usually uses something Special planned for them and your Retrieval Engine will seize.<br>
<br>
Vs Endor Operations - Flip -<br>
  This could cause problems. Get To Endor FAST! Your opponent will have to get you off of Endor, to Flip. If they can't then they can't flip. If they do flip you could be in a little bit of trouble.  You will no longer be able to draw more than one battle destiny. They will have a STRONG crew on Endor to protect it too. It will take you a little bit of time and effort but you should be able to beat this deck.<br>
<br>
Vs Carbon Chamber Testing -<br>
  To be honest I've never played against this deck so it is all speculation, but I would Let them have a non-main character (I usually include Ten Numb and Wedge in my decks). Let them freeze the captive. The force loss should only be 6 if you can get Honor of The Jedi Out. Wait until they are ready to freeze you captive to put out Honor, or else they will spread out to occupy the 3 battlegrounds. You shouldn't have any problems if they flip either. Just send a Beatdown crew to tatooine and get your captive back. Watch out for the Interrupt Hidden Weapons (remember you may subtract 1 from that destiny with JT#3)<br>
<br>
Vs Court of a Vile Gangster -<br>
    Cake! Let them sit on Tatooine. Get out Honor of the Jedi to protect you from force loss for several turns. Get To Cloud City and Drain there. If you go to tatooine, You risk getting captured. Let them come to you. (Also Watch out for Bounty Hunters Coming to Dagobah)<br>
<br>
Vs ISB Ops -<br>
  This should be easy because this deck usually relies on Force Drain Bonuses (Which are ignored from JT#1). But if they include a LOT of locations and they drain all over, go get Em! They will usually spread thin.<br>
<br>

Thank you if you have read this far. When rating this article please remember that it is for beginners or people that want to improve their MWYHL decks and need more tech.  The only reason I re-posted it is because it DID have some false (by accident) information in it before and I didn't want people trying to make a deck based on false information.  Thank you Again!<br>
