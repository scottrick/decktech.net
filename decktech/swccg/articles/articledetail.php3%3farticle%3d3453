<br>
  This is more then less a bytch article about you!!  If this info strikes a nerve, good.  If you need to take a damn card game so seriously, no wonder half of our player base left at the drop of a hat!!  If you take this article for what it is (me typing to pass time and entertain others) then great too.  Enjoy<br>
<br>
  Let&#146;s start by talking about all the crap between CCG vs TCG.  First off, the CCG game rules so back the f off of me trying to say that I&#146;m just spreading anti-CCG propaganda?  WTF is that all about?  If you know me, and 90% of you don&#146;t, then you&#146;d know that I have lived and breathed this game as a collector since the first set and as a player for the last two years now!!  This means putting in the miles to play a f-ing card game!!  So I&#146;m the last person on these boards that would ever bash the CCG.  Anyway, back to the point.  I posted an article last week about the differences between the two games.  Mostly talking about you pukes ripping on the new game.  I am also pissed that we have lost the game over to WoTC.  I will go out on a limb and state that I have spent more on this game than alot of you put together.I have ripped on WoTC since day one when Magic was a new game.  I have never wasted my time or money on any of the products they have put out (except the SW:RPG) But the FACT is they have the license now!!  Get over it!!  Yes, it hurt alot but it will not change the FACTS.  Did it sound like I was defending WoTC, maybe, but not really.  If you read it again, you would see that I am a SW Fan FIRST!!  I don&#146;t give a rat&#146;s a$$ if a mom-n-pop shop put out the new game instead of Wizards, I would have said the same things then.  All I did was try to put out the flames on this board.  This is DeckTech.net correct?  When did the site change to Decipherbytches.net?  I thought that was one of the main reasons behind the DPCs.  We went on our own thanks to a group of PLAYERS, not employees, we are able to play for cash!!   <br>
<br>
  Who&#146;s at fault with the change.  LMAO!!  this is a funny subject to me.  I have been reading now for almost 3 months that it&#146;s all Lucas&#146; fault, it&#146;s WoTC, but rarely do I ever hear anything said to the point of it also being a Decipher problem.  Let&#146;s break this one down a bit, shall we....  Who put out 4 sets in a 6month period.  Why do you think they did that?  Did they know the end was near?  After reading both statements from Lucas and Decipher, I&#146;d have to say that Big D knew this was coming and pumped out the crap like there was no tommorrow.  And guess what, there truely wasn&#146;t a tommorrow was there?  Big D had to know this was coming since ILM was not willing to approve any newer pics for card after a certain point.  Do you really think a company the size of Decipher wouldn&#146;t see that coming?  They wouldn&#146;t be in business this long if a common man like myself was to first to see that one.  Am I blaming Decipher? No.  What about ILM....notice I said ILM, not Lucas!!  ILM is a multi-level corparation that has heads of departments correct?  Do you really think the Mr Lucas is the only one sitting around making all the final decisions?  I doubt that very much.  Lucas has bigger fish to fry in the making of the movies for christ sake.  His plate is full.  I am leaning towards a group of people doing market research at all ends (WoTC,Big D, and ILM) and then they came to what they thought to be the most profitable decision for the company, not for you or me but for the company!!  That&#146;s called good business!!  Am I blaming ILM, NO!!  Then what about WoTC, is this their fault?  How can anyone blame a company that has money to burn and a bunch of products already that are going stale from trying to pick up one of, if not the biggest, Sci-Fi brands out there that is becoming available?  You can&#146;t!!  I know that over half of you (if you had the money and the idea to sell to ILM) would try to get that contract too!!  I know I sure as hell would of ;o)  So is it a WoTC problem? No!!  So who&#146;s at fault here,  how about a mixture of all of the above!!  YES&lt; I SAID EVERYONE!!  ILM mainly for letting 7-8 years of gaming fade to nothing.  Decipher, knowing that they were lossing the license, they could have done what so many other companies have done before them and sold the rights to the mechanics to WoTC too.  That way we could have had the same game included with this new game.  And to WoTC for taking the rights from Decipher in the first place.  But the CCG was taking a huge bite out of their cookie in CCG sales.  So to honestly point a finger at one person or group of persons is uncalled for and unjust.  Am I defending any one group over another?  No, I&#146;m looking at this as a major bummer across the board.  I hate WoTC, I like the CCG, and I love Star Wars!!<br>
  There seems to be three groups of SW fans out there, the gamer, the collector, and the toy guy.  Of these three groups, the collector is the one that goes after anything with the SW logo on it.  The toys, the games, and even the odd stuff like the paper plates and models.  The gamer is more than likely the guy at the card shop that picks up pretty much all the games and at least gives it a try. and the toy guy is just that.  A toy hound, going from store to store getting all the toys to eith Ebay, or for his own collection.  This new game idea looks to me like Hasbro is trying to bridge the three groups together and make one SW universe again.  For that I say Great/Shyt too.  Mainly cause as a collector myself, I will be pushed back into the other avenues again to get the complete sets.  <br>
  So how was the decision made?  I honestly only know what I have read, but anyone who has half a brain would know that this was purley a business decision.  It all boiled down to the almighty dollar!  WoTC- who&#146;s parent company is who again (Hasbro) is also in charge of both mags, Insider and Gamer.  They also have the RPG again and they are making the minitures too.  If you notice everything that is starwars is under one flagship correct.  Then we take a look at ILM, who just so happens to be a major stock holder in Hasbro, owns the rights to everything SW related and is in the business of making money correct?.  So let&#146;s go into business 101 here.  If Hasbro makes a ton of cash, ILM stock shares increase in value.  So by putting all your eggs in one basket (so to say) they are playing the market.  Increase sales to increase profit.  This could hit or miss though...if they don&#146;t have a product that is worth buying, they will loose everything but their shirts.  But this is Star Wars.  The brand has proven now for over 20 years that if they slap the logo on a product it WILL sell.  They are taking a gamble but it&#146;s a wise one to take.  <br>
  What about all the bashing going on here.  &quot;this new game sucks&quot;  Well, my question to you is what about the game sucks?  I have heard now how much it sucks, but I haven&#146;t been convinced by anyone as to why it sucks.  I had a few people tell me in my recent articles ratings that I didn&#146;t give enough new info and got rated low.  Well, practice what you are preaching and give up the info as to why this will be a crappy game.  Can you?  Have you played it?  Or are you going off the SAME info I have.  If you re-read my postings you will see that I am asking for everyone to just keep an open mind about it.  I compared the two games in reguards to the first sets.  Yes, they both suck!!  There isn&#146;t shyt in the Prem. set that anyone really uses anymore and all those cards do is collect dust in the millions of boxes that we all have at home.  Try to deny that!!  The PC is trying to fix that by revamping the old cards and so far so good but that&#146;s another article in itself.  Good job PC guys!! Great V-cards so far!  Not keeping an open mind about this or anything in life is not a good thing.  That lead this country to a civil war at one point.....and we still have white sheeted bytches running around.  Can you say bias bigots!!  I can and I do.  I call alot of you that in respect to your uninformed, second grade remarks!!  Grow up.  If we did not keep an open mind about things, would we have landed on the moon or even have had SW for that matter?<br>
  Summary, this is getting long so I&#146;ll end it here with this.  If you can&#146;t seem to understand that we are in this country and have the right to freedom of speech and the right to have different opinions on matter and you just can&#146;t seem to be able to come up with a legit arguement on a subject, then just STFU and get back to the kiddie table, cause kids should be seen, not heard!!  Here&#146;s your f-ing pasifier so go plug your hole and leave me the f alone.  If you don&#146;t like what I say then tuff shyt!!  I am using my first amendment rights and you or anyone else can&#146;t stop me.  go ahead, rate me low, big f-ing deal.  Do you really think I give a crap what my current rating is?  Bah!! Take this article with a grain of salt and back off a bit.  You don&#146;t know what the future will bring so stop griping and wait like the rest of us.  Who knows, you may be surprised.<br>
To those who think I am the anti-everything, go read my other articles BEFORE you post, you will see that I AM TRYING EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP SW:CCG ALIVE here in Colo.  In fact, go take a look at the Tournament page at Decipher and look at the Colo tourneys.  You would then see that I am pretty damn much the ONLY TD LEFT RUNNING tourneys on a regular basis.  Even the almighty Collectormania isn&#146;t running or posting tourneys anymore.  If you don&#146;t like it then do what they did and jump ship to the LOTR BS game and be the Decipherbytch that you want to be.  Otherwise, Back off Bytch<br>
