It could have been made into two parts, but I'm not a pansy like that. Enjoy.<br>
<br>
This article will contain all that you will ever need for any Profit deck that you will ever build, or for any Profit deck that you will ever play against. In this, I will look at the basics of Profit, the different types of Profit decks, and what match ups are good for Profit. To start, I'll give you the basic intro.<br>
	In case you don't know what Profit is, it stands for the Light Side objective You Can Either Profit By This.../ Or Be Destroyed. Here is the game text:<br>
<br>
	You Can Either Profit By This...<br>
	Deploy Tatooine: Jabba's Palace and Audience Chamber (with Han frozen there; he may not be moved while frozen). Opponent may deploy up to two aliens to Audience Chamber.<br>
	While this side up, opponent may not force drain at Audience Chamber and you may not force drain at Tatooine locations. You may not deploy Frozen Assets. Luke, R2-D2 C-3PO are deploy -2 at Jabba's Palace sites (Master Luke deploys free instead).<br>
	Flip this card if Han is on Tatooine and not a captive.<br>
	Place out of play if Tatooine is 'blown away.'<br>
<br>
	Or Be Destroyed<br>
	Immediately retrieve 5 force (or 10 if Han has power &lt; 4) once per game.<br>
	While this side up, cancels game text of Bad Feeling Have I. Your unpiloted starfighters may deploy to exterior Tatooine locations. During your control phase, opponent loses 1 force for each battleground location occupied by Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, or your Lando.<br>
	Flip this card if Han is captured or not on table.<br>
	Place out of play if Tatooine is 'blown away.'<br>
<br>
	As you can see, this is basically a mains and toys objective, although there are other ways to play it (which I will discuss later). You get a good start in terms of generation, getting five force, although you do give away two.  The obvious restriction on the 0 side is that you can't force drain on Tatooine locations. While at first this may seem like a immense drawback, you realize how easy the objective is to flip, so this only hampers quick cheese decks such as Elom numbers, even though that deck is still playable : ).  You also can't deploy Frozen Assets while on this side, but that is definitely justifiable, since if that were playable, you could be receiving, if you were the Dark Side, 30 point beatdowns by the second turn! The other game text that applies to the Light Side is beneficial. Luke is the key to decks like this, and a free Master Luke on the first turn will often win you games. What gives the Dark Side a fighting chance against Profit, is the fact that they can start the game with two aliens in the Audience Chamber, to help stop the flip. You, as the Dark Side player, should choose your best characters here, since they will be the ones defending from the flip.<br>
	The flip side of Profit is obviously what makes this objective one of the most powerful in the game. True, it can be flipped back if Han is killed, but you play well enough to keep him alive, the effects are devastating. First, you can immediately retrieve five to ten force, depending on which Han you use. This makes up for the no force drains on Tatooine on the 0 side, and also lets you take your time in setting up your defenses. Ignoring Bad Feeling Have I is tremendous, as it will let you deploy all your precious mains at their initial costs, something that is very helpful in the end game. You can also now use cards such as Artoo, I Have a Bad Feeling About This that would normally not be playable with Bad Feeling Have I on the table. Of course, it is the last text on the 7 side that make this objective what it is. This is what gives you the mains and toys feel of the objective. This almost occupation-like force loss is NOT a force drain, and thus cannot be stopped like one. It is unaffected by force drain modifiers such as the flip side of Operative or Raltiir Ops objectives, and it is also free from modifier canceling effects such as Imperial Decree and A Bright Center to the Universe. It is often what will win you your games when playing with this objective. But how do we free Han? Read on...<br>
	Freeing Han may seem like a daunting task at first, but it is actually easier than you may think. You have a few basic options; the first is to free Han by force. You can free a frozen captive at anytime when you control the site he is at. That free Master Luke on the 0 side goes a long way towards clearing out any unwanted aliens that may be protecting Han from your invasion force. After you remove them, build up your forces, and flip whenever you think the time is right. Another way is to use the interrupt Someone Who Loves You (SWLY). For this, you need Leia at the Audience Chamber with Han, then play SWLY to free Han if he is captive (Frozen or otherwise). This way, you don't have to rely on brute force to flip your objective, and you can use your other mains where you think they might be needed more. The other way that is somewhat used, is the trick of keeping your aliens at the Audience Chamber by using Bo Shuda, and then deploy Order to Engage to make sure that your opponent will take damage as he is protecting the Chamber. Eventually, the three force loss a turn will start to get to your opponent, and they will abandon the Chamber, freeing you to flip your objective whenever you see fit. Remember though, that is how it is supposed to happen, not how it is guaranteed to.<br>
	Ok, so you think that you can free Han somewhat easily. You've picked one of the above strategies (or created one of your own), and you know how to do it well. Your next problem becomes when to free him? A lot of this depends on your play style, and also the strategy of your deck. Some players like to set up everything on Tatooine, and then free Han, so they are prepared to do maximum damage. Others like to use only the bare essentials to free Han, and then use the rest of their forces to battle the opponent, wherever that may be. Also according to your playing style, is when you might free Han after you take over the Chamber. Some like to wait, so they retrieve all the force that they can, while others like to go for as early a flip as possible so that they can start the damage quickly. A lot of the time, this will depend on your hand at the time. If you have everything you need to fight off a counter attack at the Chamber, maybe you want to wait to free Han, since you can easily fend off any attacks. Or maybe you don't have the necessary cards to keep Han alive. That would be a reason to leave him in the Chamber, at least until you have the cards to protect him. Still, if you have everything you need to start your damage (i.e. force drains, Profit damage, and Han protection), then you may want to free him so your opponent DOESN'T have the chance to retake the Chamber, dashing your hopes of even flipping your objective.Regardless, you have to know how to keep Han alive.<br>
	No matter what kind of Profit deck you are playing, you need to be able to keep Han alive, or at least be able to deploy a second one, or a third one, etc. The most basic way to do this, is Ben Kenobi. Against most normal attacks, Ben will save Han. Simple hit squads of characters to draw destiny to attrition Han off the table, will not succeed when these two are together. However, when the opponent is packing multiple weapons (especially 4-LOM), or multiple destiny draws, Ben may not be enough. The next best way of keeping Han alive, is to use some tricky interrupts to either avoid battles, or make sure they go to your liking. Narrow Escape and It's A Trap are the best way to avoid battles, with It's A Trap serving the second function of canceling Sniper, a very good Han killer. Other good cards to pack are Fallen Portal (if you are at Jabba's Palace or a docking bay), or Put That Down. Remember though, Put That Down (PTD) has been errata'd to only cancel the targeting of weapons. So while you can avoid IG-88 with Riot Gun capturing your Han in the middle of battle, you can't do anything about DLOTS choking the life out of him. The other most used way of keeping Han alive, is to use the Jedi Pack Han, and stick him at the chamber with Bo Shuda and Oh-Oh on the table. That way, the opponent can't battle Han, so Han will almost definitely stay alive! Make sure that you have Rennek there though, because Bubo will ruin your day (and your game) if you don't. Some other cards to include if you are using this type of strategy would be It's A Trap, mainly to cancel Sniper, and You Will Take Me to Jabba Now, so Rennek shows up in time to protect Han from any unwanted creatures.<br>
	Now you know the Profit basics. You know how to free Han, and you know how important it is to keep him alive after you flip your objective. But what about the type of deck you are going to make. Well, in my experience, there are three basic profit decks, although you are by all means free to develop your own. I will list them now, and show you how to play each:<br>
	1. The Running Profit. This is the decktype made popular by Charles Hickey (Teacher here on DeckTech). It involves using most of the tricky interrupts that I mentioned before (and many others) to keep Han alive after you free him. There are two ways to free Han in this type of deck;  one is to free him by brute force, like you could in any Profit deck. The other is to use Someone Who Loves You, as I mentioned above. This gives you a contingency plan, just in case your opponent locks down the chamber quickly on you. If you rely more on beatdown, you might want two Leias (of your choosing) and two SWLYs. But if you want to use your characters off planet, as many people do, three Leias and three SWLYs will serve you well, guaranteeing that you don't have to use all your forces fighting off alien hoards. Now, once you free Han, your main mission is to keep him alive at all costs, while draining and doing Profit damage. The best set-up you can have is Ben Kenobi and his saber + your Han (probably Premiere Han Solo) at Jabba's Palace with a Fallen Portal in hand. From here, you can do a couple of things. First, you can Fallen Portal any characters essential to your opponent's attacking force immediately after they initiate the battle. That means that you can still Narrow Escape away, or It's A Trap the battle after you try to eliminate some characters! So, if you decide that you have thinned out the opposing force well enough, you can stay to fight. Having Ben Kenobi with his saber allows you two things; he can swing to get rid of some of the most annoying characters, and you can play Blaster Deflection to make sure some annoying characters with weapons, especially 4-LOM, don't get to do their damage. After all the swinging and shooting, you draw your destiny, which Han Solo can change if you draw low, as long as you have a force saved. Then, Ben can revive Han to satisfy any attrition that may have occurred. So that is your basis for keeping Han alive. The rest of your characters should either be used on your opponents sites, making sure they don't drain you to death, or on your planet causing additional force loss for your opponent. While Charles doesn't play with many characters, and very few sites, you are not locked into this. You can also spread out on Tatooine, playing multiples of your mains so that you can do some Hit and Run attacks, at the expense of some important red cards though. So, you can see why this deck is as powerful as it is today. Some key cards to consider; Narrow Escape, Fallen Portal, multiple Ben Kenobis, and Bacta Tank. Moving on.<br>
	2. Mains and Toys Profit. This is just your bashing heads M&amp;T deck, but with Profit as the basis to provide additional benefits for using your mains.This type of deck relies less on keeping Han alive, and more on being able to redeploy him once he dies. This deck will free Han by brute force, with probably no side plan such as SWLY. You can expect Clash Of Sabers, many, many mains, destiny adders, and Sense Alter Control (SAC) to be used A LOT in the freeing of Han, and in the general strategy afterwards. After Han has been freed, Ben Kenobi will probably protect him, but with none of the other interrupts and effects to keep him alive, save Bacta Tank and possibly Mantellian Savrip. Aside from that, you will see the typical mains and toys strategies coming out here. Nabrun Leids will definitely be played, as well as the a fore mentioned destiny adders, and all the other classic cards that make mains and toys so fun to play. Key cards; Nabrun Leids, Clash of Sabers, destiny adders, and SAC. And to the last popular decktype...<br>
	3. Alien Cheese Profit. This is the most annoying Profit of the bunch, but it is still an effective one. The standard start for this is Yarna to protect from Monnok, with Jedi Pack Han as the captive. Using multiple You Will Take Me to Jabba Nows, you get your key aliens to the Chamber with Bo Shuda + Uh-Oh to protect them. The usual aliens will be Rennek, to protect from Bubo, Tessek, to make your non-uniques cheaper and enhance your force drains, and whatever alien representative you are using, depending on what non-uniques you are using. It will usually be Tanus Spejik (sp?), because Eloms are the best aliens to do this with. After you are set up like this, put Order to Engage out, and protect it at all costs. I explained this strategy above, and it will drive your opponent out of the Chamber. Then, you are free to release Han, and start your damage. This deck will only use a few mains, using them to back up the non-uniques, and provide more Profit damage. This is a very strong deck, with a very good chance of beating ROps, but it is very weak against Court, because they don't provide any imperials for you (unless your opponent is stupid enough to put out Mara Jade). Key cards; You Will Take Me to Jabba Now, Rennek, Tessek, Yarna, non-uniques, Nar Shadda Wind Chimes, and Order to Engage.<br>
	Now I have given you the different decktypes, but what decks are good against which? What changes do you need to make in your play style depending upon which deck you face? Well, I will breakdown the Profit matchups here, going by which Profit style you are playing, and what popular Dark Side deck you are playing against. The Dark Side decks that I will be using will be HuntDown w/o dueling, HuntDown w/ dueling, Raltiir Ops (ROps), Court, and Big Blue. Let's begin with Running Profit.<br>
<br>
	Running Profit vs HuntDown w/o dueling. This is the less dangerous HuntDown that RP has to worry about. With this type of deck, you can either expect Big Blue style HuntDown, or just a mix of power characters, focused on one or two planets, usually Endor or Tatooine, possibly Cloud City. The important thing in this game is to make sure you have some battle evasion cards. You will see lots of characters with weapons, and probably Dr. Evazan. They will destroy Han if you let them attack you. Don't free Han until you are holding either a Narrow Escape, an It's a Trap, or a Fallen Portal if you can set up at Jabba's Palace. Once those characters are down, you can deal with them. You can run away from them, Sorry About the Mess the most important characters, Disarm the ones with weapons, or draw for your Quite a Mercenary if they are using Elis Helrot. That's the main point to this game. Another may be Bubo. He can come down and kill your Han, without fear of getting a beatdown in return. A great card to stop this is Yoda's Gimer Stick. Put this on Ben Kenobi, and leave him with Han at Jabba's Palace. That way, Bubo can't attack your Han, your opponent has to have the right characters if he wants to battle you, and you can use it for Order to Engage tech!<br>
	Running Profit vs HuntDown w/ dueling. This can be a very dangerous game. Have your battle evasion ready just as above, but you also need much dueling protection. Playing against this deck makes putting down Ben Kenobi, an essential part of your deck, very dangerous. You really should have at least two of the following before you put him down; Courage of a Skywalker, Glancing Blow, Swing and a Miss, or Obi-Wan's Lightsaber. Fallen Portal is also a good card to have, in case he tries to battle, then duel so he can cancel with Tarkin. Removing Tarkin from the equation just might save old Ben. Run Luke, Run is a great card to protect Luke, as it is a 6 destiny, flat out cancels the duel, and has a decent second purpose. Beyond dueling, you play this game like above. Unless this HuntDown is Big Blue, your drains probably won't be modified, and you can win through Profit damage and drains.<br>
	Running Profit vs Raltiir Ops. This is one of the best games that you play. It is difficult to win, but it isn't impossible. Your Profit damage is what will win you the game, but you need to stop your opponent from flipping. An early Master Luke and Ben Kenobi on Tatooine, and then a Nabrun over onto Raltiir just may win you the game. If you go this route, you need to have battle evasion, or you need to stock up Han's site so your opponent can't just kill him with attrition. Draw for those Narrow Escapes, It's a Traps, and Fallen Portals. Mechanical Failure will help you deal with the walkers, and Senses or cheap rebels like Corporal Beezer or Romas 'Lock' Navandar can help you stop reacting. Smoke Screens will also come in handy, helping you to knock out the pilots AND their respective walkers. If your opponent does flip, the battle evasion will be key, otherwise his destinies will knock you out. Bacta Tank will be important to have as a contingency. Since your force drains will be -1, your Profit damage will be what wins you the game, so make sure you're doing a decent amount of it. Basically, try to stop the flip, and if you can't, buy time while you drain/ Profit him out.<br>
	Running Profit vs Court. Great game here. You will be denying them force early, but if they are smart, they will covert your Chamber with their Cloud City Engineer. Your best bet will be to control the Chamber quickly. Get an early Master Luke down, and then back him up with Ben. If you control the Chamber, they can't play Scum, and that will win you the game. Once you are fortified there, start spreading out with your mains, so you can start the damage. You can bait them out and then avoid the battles, possibly leaving them wide open to counter strikes. It will be a battle for Tatooine, but it is one that you can easily win. Be prepared to have to use Leia and SWLY, because a good Court deck will seal off the Chamber quickly.<br>
	Running Profit vs Big Blue. This is again a difficult game, but it doesn't mean that you can't win. Mechanical Failure will be your saving grace, as will a decent package of ships, especially the Spiral. If you rely more on Landing Claws, they will be useful here, and you should probably look for Yoxgit as quick as possible. He will keep you free from paying for Battle Order, and he will keep your opponent's space drains in check. On the ground, Smoke Screens are key, as will be destiny adders. Battling and hoping to draw high enough destiny to remove pilots is not a good strategy. Try to ensure that you will take out the vehicle as well. You can take care of their characters with weapon fire, and things like Sorry About the Mess and Disarmed. Killing the walkers will win you the game, as will either Landing Claw or a solid space fleet. Imperial Decree and Battle Order could single-handedly kill you, so good ships are key.<br>
<br>
	Now that we have gone through Running Profit's matchups, we will move on to Mains and Toys Profit.<br>
	Mains and Toys Profit vs HuntDown w/o dueling. An old school matchup if I ever saw one. Basic M&amp;T versus basic M&amp;T. Your keys here will be to protect Han with Ben, the power of your effects, and your SAC package. Effects such as Bacta Tank, Mantellian Savrip, and Order to Engage will win you this game. You SAC package is essential in stopping your opponents tricks, as well as protecting your effects from your opponent's counters, such as Sensing Masterful Move or Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down. Your mains and their various tricks (destiny adders, Clash of Sabers, and Smoke Screens) should be able to handle the Dark Sides.<br>
	Mains and Toys Profit vs HuntDown w/ dueling. Just as above, only you'll need your dueling protection. Although he isn't as important here as he is in Running Profit, Ben Kenobi should still be kept alive at all costs. Same as Luke. They won't be as essential to your strategy, but it would definitely be a good idea to make sure you have dueling protection before you put out those two powerhouses. Again, your various tricks, as well as your drains, Profit damage, and battle damage should allow you to win this.<br>
	Mains and Toys Profit vs Raltiir Ops. This is the most dangerous game for this deck. ROps is a great counter for M&amp;T decks, so you have to play carefully. Here, the key is definitely to stop your opponent from flipping. Why? Because otherwise the high destinies will just rip you up, Savrip or not. Your SAC package and grabbers will also be key here. You need to stop tricks such as You Are Beaten and Elis Helrot, so you need to have your Senses and Alters go through. A great way to do this, is to make sure that your opponent does keep his SAC recirculating. Grab it, and make sure he has to pay to use it. This will stop your opponent, and keep your effects and interrupts from being canceled. If your opponent flips, flip him back. Tantive IV and Jeoren Webb will help here, as well good activation, which this deck should have. You need to keep fighting on Raltiir, because if you let him be, he will kill you on Tatooine. The usual tricks should be used here, and if you can win on Raltiir, you will win the game.<br>
	Mains and Toys Profit vs Court. In my opinion, one of the easier games. Your SAC should stop their tricks, such as Scum, Jabba's Through With You, Imperial Barrier, and Projective Telepathy. Fighting is what will win you the game, and the Beggar + Draw Their Fire combo will serve you well here. Weapons will kill your opponents aliens, as will destiny adders and Smoke Screens, since they have relatively low forfeit. The only mildly difficult part here should be freeing Han, but even that should be easy. They really can't contend as long as your deck is prepared.<br>
	Mains and Toys Profit vs Big Blue. Very similar to Running Profit's strategy. Multiple, high destinies will be extremely important, as will be SAC. Fighting them off where they go, all while draining and Profit damaging can be done. It will be best to set up Leia, Chewie, Han, and maybe Lando on Tatooine while Luke, Obi, and support characters go off to fight the opponent.  Bacta Tank and Savrip will save your ass here, so make sure you keep them on the table. Draining and Profit damage will take care of your opponent, as long as you can stop them from setting up.<br>
<br>
	Now, onto the last style of Profit, Alien Cheese. Take note, for all these games, I will assume the use of Eloms, since they are the best aliens to play this with.<br>
	Alien Cheese Profit vs HuntDown w/o dueling. This will actually be the tougher HuntDown to face. Freeing Han should not be difficult, but if your opponent is playing SAC, you must make sure that you have the proper effects to deal with it. Do or Do Not, Wise Advice, and grabbers will win this game for you, so make sure they are in there. Once you are flipped, send the Eloms in, using them to attack the Imperials, leaving the mains to deal with the aliens that are bound to appear. The raw power of Eloms should win out, and Tessek will provide the extra drain boost that you need to win. If you don't need the mains to c lean up aliens, let them drain and do Profit damage, making the opponent come to you.<br>
	Alien Cheese Profit vs HuntDown w/ dueling. This type of HuntDown doesn't scare you as much. You can easily live without Obi and Luke, so if dueling protection IS in your deck, don't deploy them until you have it. But as I said, they aren't that important here. Leia, Chewie, and Lando should provide backup to your Eloms, and support characters such as Orrimaarko and Tawass Khaa will come in handy. Again, you must deal with SAC, and Tessek will provide the drain boost. Let your Eloms do their job, and once per game Nar Shadda should finish your opponent off easily.<br>
	Alien Cheese Profit vs Raltiir Ops. This is a great meta-matchup. If ROps is popular in your area, this is the deck to bring. Again, freeing Han should be easy, and while they are feeling safe with Bad Feeling Have I on the table, beat on them with Eloms! Let Eloms run wild through the streets of Raltiir! Sorry. Tessek will lower their deploy cost even more, so you should be able to deal with the Imperials early. And fighting early is important, because your Eloms won't be able to handle the high destiny. A good space fleet will come in handy here, so you can lock down one site on Raltiir, and then control the system to prevent the flip. Trample can hurt you a lot, so make sure you have a grabber present. Let your mains do damage on Tatooine, and Nabrun them over to Raltiir only if the Eloms need help. The Profit damage will be key if your opponent flips, even with Tessek at the Chamber. Stop the flip, and you will win.<br>
	Alien Cheese Profit vs Court. The most difficult matchup that this deck will face. Your Eloms are almost nothing, unless your opponent is stupid enough to deploy Mara Jade. You have to rely on your mains, and back them up with Eloms, so that the drains will be big enough to hurt the opponent. Try to pick your battles, because if they get Scum working to it's fullest, then you will lose. Your saving grace in this game, will be the fact that you can drive your opponent out of the Chamber by using Bo Shuda + Order to Engage. That way, they won't be able to set up Scum, and you have a fighting chance. Capturing will hurt, so don't let your mains be captured. Be especially careful if All Wrapped Up is on the table. Pick and choose your battles, and try to drain them out. If you can stop them from setting up Scum, it's your game.<br>
	Alien Cheese Profit vs Big Blue. Similar to your ROps strategy. Mechanical Failure will be great. Use it to the fullest. A well timed Elom beatdown combined with this will win you games. Use your mains for the Profit damage, and to give your Eloms support in case they run up against aliens. Bacta Tank will help you out a lot, as you can send your Eloms there and back for dirt cheap as long as Tessek is on the table.  If you can set up a couple of good drains, such as the Cantina Shuffle, then you should be able to win this game pretty easily.<br>
<br>
	Well, that's it for my article. I hope that it gave you a better understanding of Profit and how it works. It is truly one of the best decks out there, so give it a try. It is a blast to play, and it wins too. Enjoy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1227"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1227"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1227" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
