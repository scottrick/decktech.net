Thanks in advance for your reviews, and I hoped I have met your expectations (and my own, though I'll decide that) in this article.	Hope you enjoy it.<br>
<br>
This installment of the article only includes the first four DS objectives, as I am unable to add more to this post without crossing over the Decktech word limit.  Look for the last 4 dark side objectives and the light side ones in the future; they will be in the same format.  Oh, I might include the Third Anthology objectives into my next articles if I have the space.  I am hoping that none of this article is truncated; if it is, I'll either post the addition of the message board if it is short, or as another article if it is a large portion, though that's doubtful.  Oh well, I just hope this comes out right due to the size.<br>
<br>
As stated by my title, there are endless possibilities in this game, concerning deck types.  This article will focus on most of the objectives out there.  I'm hoping to provide both general overviews for each objective, as well as specific types that can be played.  Who knows, maybe I'll uncover a new strategy.  (Please ignore the laughing you hear from my direction, what, me, uncover a new strategy?  Ha :-) I imagine this will get pretty long, and I hope you can bear with me enough to read it all before reviewing.  Remember, if there is a section that you think you know all about (HD, for instance) you can always skip it and save time for my synopsis of the other objectives.<br>
<br>
What I hope to accomplish with this article:<br>
<br>
1) Show you the reader that there are countless deck possibilities using any of the objectives made.<br>
2) To provide an in-depth analysis for each objective and possible show newer players different strategies with them.<br>
3) Help you in some way, be it explaining a specific deck type or showing you the power of an objective.<br>
4) In some way help you have more fun when playing.  For me, that's what it is all about.<br>
<br>
I'll start with my views on objectives.  Personally, I am glad that Decipher introduced objectives to us players.  They allow for greater stability and direction of decks, as well as an improved playing field.  With them, new and old players alike can pick a theme for their decks and create potentially tournament viable decks from scratch, as long as they include many of the 'staple' cards for each side.  I use the term staple broadly.  It refers to the addition of cards such as Vader, Mara, bounty hunters in their ships, twix sites, grabbers, sac, etc for the dark side, and Luke, Obi, Leia, Han, Spiral, Tantive 4, anti-duel cards, etc for the light side.  Although objectives might severely decrease the originality of many players' decks, this is because those players use the winning decks of the world's top players to emulate and modify to their own needs.  This is no way indicative that other deck types using those objectives do not exist; it merely means that they are not discovered or accepted in the current tournament scene.  It is my hope that this article will perhaps influence another player into attempting a different type of deck and break the bond of conformity that many players feel bound to.  To those of you who do, kudos and the best of luck to you during your future endeavors.<br>
<br>
I think for the construction of this article, I will talk about the DS objectives first, and then the LS ones.	I will also go alphabetically.	There are two reasons for this &amp;#8211; 1) It's easier for my layout to be structured. 2) I'm trying to show that all of the objectives have their uses and could possibly be made into tournament viable decks.  Putting Hunt Down and RalOps first would just prove to show that I think they are the best two objectives.<br>
<br>
Enough of my babbling, let's get to the cards:<br>
<br>
<br>
DS Objective #1 - Carbon Chamber Testing / My Favorite Decoration<br>
<br>
Front side - [Deploy Carbonite Chamber, Carbonite Chamber Console and Security Tower with a Rebel (opponent's choice) from opponent's Reserve Deck (if possible) imprisoned there.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy from Reserve Deck one Audience Chamber, Docking Bay 94 or East Platform, reshuffle. You may not play Dark Deal.  {Flip} this card if you move a frozen captive to Audience Chamber (or if no Rebel was in opponent's Reserve Deck at start of game).<br>
<br>
Flip side - {While} this side up, your aliens and [independent] starships are immune to attrition less than 4 and, once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve 1 Force. While you have a frozen captive at Audience Chamber, Scum And Villainy is immune to Alter and during your deploy phase, you may deploy Scum And Villainy from Reserve Deck, reshuffle.  {Place} out of play if there are no frozen captives on table (unless no Rebel was in opponent's Reserve Deck at start of game).<br>
<br>
This objective was played regularly in the beginning when Special Edition was released, but since then has heavily declined due to the massive number of Hunt Down and Raltiir Operations decks, along with the perceived weakness of the objective.  It used to include numerous bounty hunters, and was considered the bounty-hunting deck.  However, with the release of the Enhanced series, Court of the Vile Gangster has become the new objective to be utilized in conjunction with bounty hunters en masse.  Despite the changes, in most tournaments with semi-large turnouts, there is at least one player using a CCT deck.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the front side first (what a novel idea): It allows you to start with the Cloud City: Carbonite Chamber and the Security Prison, providing you with a start of four activation, while giving your opponent an extra force icon.	Not bad, considering you can also pull out two docking bays and the Audience Chamber with the front side of the objective.  Activation is fairly good for this objective, though other objectives do provide more.  If you include Imperial Arrest Order, you will be able to pull more docking bays from your reserve deck, providing more force to be utilized.  You also start with the Carbonite Chamber Console, which allows you to pull Ugnaught's and other cards necessary to easily freeze a captive.  In order to hinder the usefulness of this objective, you may not play Dark Deal.  Of course, if you really want a DD deck, use TDIGWATT, which I will talk about later on in the next installment.  The objective then flips if you move a frozen captive to the Audience Chamber (remember, move there - playing Profit does not give you a one turn flip, so the only way to flip with Han as the captive is to allow him to be released, and then re-freeze him and move him), or if your opponent had no rebels in their deck.  That last part is fairly uncommon, as the majority of Light Side decks (and all good ones, basically) have at least one rebel, whether it be mains or support characters.  Generally, your opponent will give you a low power, ability, forfeit character that is in no way vital to their deck.	A prime example of this kind of character is Jeroen Webb, who is included in many LS decks because of his expendability and his spy status.  However, if for some reason your opponent does not have a rebel in their deck, you are set.  You now have an immediately flipped objective that can't be flipped back or placed out of play.<br>
<br>
Now for the back side, which is where the true power of the objective is present.   All your aliens and independent starships are immune to attrition less than 4.  This is extremely powerful when you use numerous bounty hunters (including ECC and EJP) and their ships.  If used in conjunction with the Enhanced Cloud City and Enhanced Jabba's Palace bounty hunters, you will be capturing characters left to right, seeing as how your opponent will have to draw a 5 or more for their destiny in order to kill one of them off.  In conjunction with Scum and Villainy, these bounty hunters and starships also deploy minus one, allowing for a beat-down in fewer amounts of turns.  The next part of the text is awesome.  You can retrieve 1 force every turn during your control phase.  If you do get in battle, and you lose one of your hunters, you simply retrieve him next turn with the objective.  You may also deploy an immune to alter Scum and Villainy during your deploy phase, providing added benefits, which I will explain momentarily.  The objective is then flipped back if there are no frozen captives on the table.  This is the objective's most damaging downfall.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benefits of the objective:<br>
<br>
Bounty hunters, aliens, and ships, Oh My! - They deploy minus one (providing you have S&amp;V out) and are immune to attrition less than four.	Heavy beat-downs are common in this objective, as you deploy massive amounts of characters cheaper, and you won't be losing them as quickly as you would normally.<br>
<br>
Character removal - No, not removal as in Neal's 'Damage Incorporated: Removal = Big Smack' article.  I mean removal as in taking away numerous characters from the light side's game plan, by means of capturing them.  If you include IG-88 with Riot Gun, Bossk with Mortar Gun, Dengar's Modified Riot Gun, and the other weapons that allow you to capture, you can say goodbye to all those pesky mains and mofo's.<br>
<br>
Retrieval, and lots of it - Not only do you retrieve one force during each of your control phases, but there are also other ways of heavy retrieval in this objective deck.  For instance, if you have S&amp;V out (which you should), you will also retrieve 2 force every time you battle.  Throw in First Strike, and when you battle, they lose 1 while you retrieve 3.  Seeing as how Draw Their Fire is usually a LS staple, you battle and retrieve 4, and they lose 2.	That's a six-force power swing during each of your turns.  In conjunction with the 1 force retrieval every turn, and the massive amounts of characters in this deck, it is easy to retrieve up to five force a turn, and make them lose two.  If you happen to lose several of your character, just deploy more, battle, and retrieve those you lost back.  There is also the force retrieved from taking the captives to prisons.  Throw in the special bounty cards, as well as the generic one, and you'll be retrieving more after every battle than you already are.  This is the best part about this objective.  It is very easy to end the game with virtually no cards in your lost pile, as you can retrieve it all back while 'laying the beats' on your opponent.  Also, if you use numerous non-unique aliens of the same type, you can retrieve more with Abyssin Ornament.<br>
<br>
<br>
Downsides of the objective:<br>
<br>
Early beat-down - A good light side deck with lots of force generation can deploy mains and other high-powered characters to cloud city early on and release your captive.  If you allow your opponent to kill off your characters quickly and prevent you from flipping, you are going to have some serious problems later on in the game.<br>
<br>
Card Intensive - In order to properly play this objective, assuming you are attempting to flip it, requires numerous cards and fills up your deck quickly.  These cards include Ugnaughts, Carbon Freezing, Prepare the Chamber, and many, many characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Possible Strategies:<br>
<br>
Capture / Freeze Everyone - Use Bounty, We're the Bait, Vader's Bounty, The Emperor's Prize, etc and capture/freeze all their mains that you can.  Take frozen Luke to the Detention Block Corridor, and laugh as your opponent loses half their life force.<br>
<br>
Capture some, kill the rest - Capture or send to the used pile as many of their characters as you can, and then beat-down on the remaining small support characters with large amounts of aliens and hunters.<br>
<br>
Numbers - Include Skrillings and Pote and just forget about freezing your captive; instead, use the early generation to deploy your characters and use inserts to cause damage.<br>
<br>
Manipulation - Basically the same as for numbers, just using manipulation cards.  Virtually any deck can play manipulation; it just takes a good player to effectively play it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cards to include:<br>
<br>
Aliens: regular, ECC and EJP, and their ships, aliens, Mara Jade.<br>
Freezing Materials: Carbon Freezing, Ugnaughts, Ugloste, Prepare the Chamber, All to Easy.<br>
Bounty Helpers: Bounty, We're the Bait, He's All Yours Bounty Hunter, The Emperor's Prize, Vader's Bounty.<br>
Helpers: Scum and Villainy, First Strike, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall:<br>
<br>
Hit or Miss - If you pull it off, your opponent will have a hard time making you lose force other than that that you can retrieve during your next turn, and will not be able to deploy only one or two characters down without fear of being beaten heavily.  However, if your opponent stops you early on, you will be the one struggling to change the balance of power that they will be in their favor.  Good luck to those who decide to attempt this objective.	Some good ones on DT have come from Mike 'Iceman' Fitzgerald and Johan 'Johan' van deer Meer.<br>
<br>
<br>
DS Objective #2 - Court of the Vile Gangster / My Favorite Decoration<br>
<br>
Front side - [Deploy Audience Chamber, Great Pit Of Carkoon and Dungeon.] {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one docking bay or [independent] starship from Reserve Deck, reshuffle. Bounty Hunters are forfeit +2 and immune to Goo Nee Tay. You may not play Scanning Crew. Each player loses 1 Force at end of each of their deploy phases unless that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine battleground site. {Flip} this card if you have two captives (or a captive of ability greater than 2) at any Jabba's Palace site(s).<br>
<br>
Flip side - {While} this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy Sarlacc, Rancor or Rancor Pit from Reserve Deck, reshuffle. Captives targeted by trap door are immediately relocated to Rancor Pit (do not draw destiny) and Trap Door may not be canceled. Opponent loses Force equal to forfeit value of each opponent's character eaten by a Rancor or Sarlacc (place that character out of play). {Flip} this card if you have no captives at Tatooine sites and opponent has no character at same site as Rancor.<br>
<br>
Court of the Vile Gangster has rapidly become the new bounty hunting deck, as it allows greater benefits than the older Carbon Chamber Testing objective.  COTVG is, from my experience, the third-most popular objective for the dark side, behind Hunt Down and Raltiir Ops.	If played correctly, Court can prove to be an extremely powerful objective that can easily crush your opponent.  As the counter-part to profit, COTVG has an inherent advantage when facing Profit and/or Tatooine based decks.  This however, does not mean Court is broken in any way, it just means it is powerful.<br>
<br>
Taking a look at the front of the objective, you will activate four force from your starting sites, but unfortunately you give up two to your opponent.  This hurts the usefulness of this deck, as a LS throne room mains deck with tons of activation will be able to out generate you on the first turn alone.  However, the Audience Chamber is included, which allows you to convert Profit's AC if you utilize a CC engineer, which I suggest you do if you play Court.	Next, the objective allows you to deploy from your reserve deck a docking bay or independent starship from your reserve deck during each of your deploy phases.  Remember, independent starships includes those extremely helpful bounty hunters in their ships, such as Boba Fett in Slave 1, Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, Dengar in Punishing One, and Bossk in Hound's Tooth.  This part of the objective's deck is similar to Imperial Arrest Order, but will still allow you to use Elis Helrot at any point during your turn; consequently, your opponent will also be able to play Nabrun Leids whenever they want, unless, of course, they play Insurrection.  This will allow you to move your characters and beat-down the light side quickly, which can prove to be a very powerful asset.  The next part of the text is incredibly useful for bounty hunting decks, as all of your bounty hunters are forfeit +2, which counteracts the low forfeit of the ECC and EJP bounty hunters with their weapons, and they are immune to Goo Nee Tay, allowing a quicker deploy.  In order to prevent Court Manip, you are not allowed to play scanning crew until you flip the objective (key word = until).	Next is the powerful part of this objective, and that is the fact that at end of each players turns, each player loses 1 force unless they have a non-droid character on Tatooine.  Many players do not flip the objective in order to keep this aspect of the objective in play, because in conjunction with numerous characters, you can beat your opponent off of Tatooine and make them continuously lose force; furthermore, they will not be able to cancel this loss as easily as they can cancel Visage of the Emperor.  Keep in mind, however, that you also lose force during each of these turns if you can't or don't have a character out on Tatooine.  This may hurt if you are playing a power Profit deck that recycles Ben Kenobi and Master Luke to simply beat-down, clash, bounce, and saber your characters, and then simply revive Master Luke.  Court then flips if you have two captives at any Jabba's Palace site, or any captive with ability over 2.  (Keep in mind that the Han given up for Profit does not count as one of these captives, and you may not move him out and then back in for an immediate flip.)<br>
<br>
In my personal opinion, the flipped side of this objective is far less useful or powerful than the front.  No longer does each player have to lose force for not having characters, your bounty hunters are no longer forfeit plus two, and Goo Nee Tay will now have full effect on your bounty hunters.  Instead, you may deploy the Rancor, Sarlacc, or Rancor Pit from your reserve deck.  Since you already have the Great Pit of Carkoon on the table, by utilizing this side of the objective you will have two potential ways of eliminating captives and retrieving force.  Decipher has made Trap Door more effective by making characters immediately go to the Rancor Pit, without them drawing destiny, and the light side may not cancel Trap Door.  Your opponent loses force equal to the forfeit of their characters eaten, and they are placed out of play.  This is the one bright side to the back of the objective: the ability to make your opponent lose force after you capture their characters, and you place them out of play.  Should you be lucky and capture a main character, you will be able to prevent any further copies from coming into play while at the same time forcing them to lose a fair amount of force.  The objective then flips back if you have no captives at Jabba's Palace and your opponent doesn't have a character at the same site of the Rancor.  This means that should you allow your creatures to munch down on some tasty treats :-), your objective will then flip back and you will regain the bonuses provided from the front side of the objective.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benefits of the objective:<br>
<br>
Bounty Hunters and Independent ships, oh my! - As with Carbon Chamber Testing, this objective can be used in conjunction with numerous bounty hunters and other aliens to provide you with massive amounts of power and capture weapons, assuming you are using ECC and EJP cards.  The added fact that they are forfeit plus two and immune to Goo Nee Tay is icing on the cake.  Should you include Scum and Villainy, which I heavily suggest you do, they will also deploy minus one.<br>
<br>
Afraid to deploy? - Should you beat your opponent away from Tatooine, and provide enough of a presence on Tatooine to deter them from re-deploying, they will be forced to lose one force at the end of both of your turns.<br>
<br>
Tear Profit a new one - My favorite strategy for starting against Profit.  For the two deployed free, choose Mara Jade and Chall Bekan.  During your turn, pull Mara's Saber, and use Bekan's game text to pull CC Engineer from your reserve deck.  Deploy him, convert the Audience Chamber, and use the AC game text to pull Jabba.  If you have the force, deploy him on your first turn.  Against many Profit decks, this is enough of a first turn start to prevent them from freeing Han until you can reinforce the area.<br>
<br>
Retrieval Baby, Retrieval - This section is basically the exact same as I explained under Carbon Chamber Testing, with one added bonus.  You have the Rancor and Sarlacc in your deck (possibly) allowing you to retrieve more and make them lose a considerate amount of force and the ability to re-deploy that character at the same time.<br>
<br>
It Don't Do Jack - Many, many players believe that Court is a bad, pointless objective that doesn't really do anything.  If you catch them off guard by using this objective easily, you will greatly increase your chances of winning the game, as they won't be prepared for the objective.<br>
<br>
<br>
Downsides of the objective:<br>
<br>
It Don't Do Jack - Sometimes that view by many, many players is correct.  If your opponent gains early control of the game, you'll be hard pressed to do anything, as you will lose from your own objective for the rest of the game.<br>
<br>
Effectiveness - Unless you play it flawlessly, Court is nowhere near as effective as Hunt Down and RalOps in terms of effectiveness and playability.  Unless you are confident that you can pull of the requirements of a good COTVG deck fairly quickly, this might not be the objective for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Possible Strategies:<br>
<br>
Ground Warfare - The way that I mentioned above deals with using numerous characters on the ground to beat-down whomever your opponent drops.  Simply put, it's one of the closest ways to achieve a dark side Mains and Toys.  Add in all your mains, and them your good bounty hunters and their weapons (attached and otherwise).<br>
<br>
Space - Despite the information I provided in my first synopsis of this objective, it is possible to create a good Court deck that holds only the audience chamber and then 'flees' to space and inflicts damage there.  If you try this strategy, be sure to pack your ECC and EJP hunters in ships, as they can cause many problems for anything the light side puts in space.  Because of the ability to pull independent starships and the bonuses to aliens (if you have Scum and Villainy), ORS become even more powerful than normal.	It is even feasible to include the Jabba's Space Cruiser combo that others have mentioned.  Add EPP Fett, ORS, Jabba, etc, and you get a very powerful DS ship that can combat the Falcon.<br>
<br>
'A lot of people even now think Court is about bounty hunting and battling on the ground. I take advantage of controlling ONLY the audience chamber and winning in space, and draining at the space locations. Of course I still battle on the ground, but I pick and choose wisely.' - Tim 'Info Broker' Guzman<br>
<br>
Numbers - You can always play numbers with this objective.  Skrillings and Pote on Tatooine come to mind.  The one problem with numbers is you basically lose the ability to deploy any of your heavy-hitters and hunters.<br>
<br>
Cards to include:<br>
<br>
Characters - Bounty Hunters, high-powered aliens, Jabba, mains, ORS, and basically anybody that you think will help you in ground or space.<br>
Space - All your hunters in their ships, Jabba's Space Cruiser, Star Destroyers for power (probably just the Executor).<br>
Helpers - Scum and Villainy, Much Anger in Him, and possibly Abyssin Ornament if you use multiple Outer Rim Scout's.<br>
Bounty Helpers - Should you actually hunt, you can always include cards such as Bounty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall:<br>
<br>
Hit or Miss - This is another objective that has the potential to be extremely powerful, but if it is not played correctly, you have a good chance of taking a severe loss because of your mistakes.  Don't be afraid to try it out, however, as even catching them by surprise can be effective and fun at the same time.  Looking at some of the Court decks here on DT, I've seen a few good ones from Tim 'Info Broker' Guzman, Andrew 'Gadget' Ledwith, and Jon 'Bravo 10' Tomayko.<br>

DS Objective #3 - Endor Operations / Imperial Outpost<br>
<br>
Front side - [Deploy Endor system, Bunker and Landing Platform.] {While} this side up, once during each of your control phases may take one Ominous Rumors or Establish Secret Base into hand from Reserve Deck, reshuffle. {Flip} this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are both on table. {Place} out of play if an Endor location is 'blown away'.<br>
<br>
Flip side - {While} this side up, at each Endor site where you have a biker scout or a piloted AT-ST, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent, except by a 'react'. Opponent draws no more than one battle destiny in each battle. Your AT-ST's are immune to attrition less than 3. Once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one biker scout. {Flip} this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are not both on table. {Place} out of play if an Endor location is 'blown away.'<br>
<br>
As you can tell, it is now time for me to do my synopsis on Endor Operations.  I haven't seen very many good decks that utilize this objective, and it is my hope that after reading this either a) people will realize it is possible to make a good deck using this objective, or b) there is a reason why nobody uses this.<br>
<br>
Looking at the front side of the objective, Endor Operations does not look very powerful.  You start with three sites, giving you a starting activation of four force and them three.  This is the first serious downfall to the objective: you are already giving your opponent nearly as much force as you are getting, and if you play a light side deck that doesn't give you anything, you will be behind in the activation race from the very beginning.  That's always a bad way to start, but it is possible to overcome it with this objective.  The only other thing the objective does on the front is it allows you to pull Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base during your control phase from your reserve deck.  Remember that Establish Secret Base gives you force drain bonuses for controlling Endor with AT-ST's and/or Biker Scouts, and Ominous Rumors adds another 2 to your force drains at battleground systems for controlling Endor sites.  The objective then flips when you have both of the above cards out on the table at the same time, which is relatively easy to do.  And of course, the objective is placed out of play if Endor is blown away.  I've never seen an objective-based deck also include effective CPI, so don't worry about that.<br>
<br>
Now onto the back side of the objective.  The first benefit given is that it prevents your opponent from canceling or modifying your force drains where you have AT-ST's and/or Biker Scouts, which provides the potential for you to set up a large, heavy-hitting force drain on Endor that your opponent will be hard-pressed to stop.  The clause for when these drains are un-modifiable makes the utilization of reacting AT-ST's on Endor a plausible course of action.  Biker scouts are another possibility, but I believe that AT-ST's and AT-ST pilots is a much more powerful and effective force to control your planet. With Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base out on the table, you have the potential to drain for two to three force at virtually every site, even more if you use cards such as Presence of the Force or sabers.  The next part of the objective helps against LS Mains and adders decks, as you prevent them from drawing more than one battle destiny each battle, which effectively makes all of their teamwork adders and other destiny adders (EPP Han / Leia&amp;#8217;s game text, for instance) useless.  This is very helpful when you need to keep control of Endor in order to keep Establish and Ominous out on the table.  Also, according to the text of the flip side of the objective, all of your AT-ST's are immune to attrition under 3, which provides you another reason to play with the Tempest Scouts on Endor in order to control the necessary sites.  Finally, you can retrieve one Biker Scout during each of your deploy phases.  I find it interesting how Decipher divided the benefits of this objective between the AT-ST's and the Biker Scouts, though I imagine it is an attempt to keep the objective in balance.  Should you play with Biker Scouts and Speeder Bikes, you'll be able to continuously retrieve the scouts so that you can re-deploy them later on during the game.  The balance between these two cards is your choice.  Unfortunately, the objective flips back if either Ominous Rumors or Establish Secret Base is not on the table.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benefits of the objective:<br>
<br>
Heavy force draining - With the force drain bonuses provided by Establish Secret Base and Ominous Rumors, in conjunction with the Imperial Outpost text that states your drains may not be canceled or modified on Endor when you have an AT-ST or a Biker Scout, you will be able to force drain for a large amount at each site and system that you control.	Even a few turns of these heavy drains can put an opponent down by a significant amount, thus shifting the balance of power to you.<br>
<br>
Vehicles galore - The bonuses provided by the objective provide even more reasons why AT-ST's are extremely powerful, when matched with AT-ST pilots.	Also, this objective can actually make using Biker Scouts and Speeder Bikes a plausible strategy, in conjunction with unique biker scouts, and the biker helper cards.	This can allow you to have reacting, high landspeed vehicles able to follow your opponent or react to every site on Endor they are at, thus making it harder on them to take control of Endor away from you and flip your objective back to the 0 side.<br>
<br>
<br>
Downsides of the objective:<br>
<br>
Activation - At the beginning of the game, you will only be activating five force (including the personal one), yet you give your opponent three.  In nearly every case, your opponent will be out-activating you from their first turn on.  If you play a Throne Room mains with revolution deck, you will be struggling to get any activation in.  Because of this, it is necessary for you include numerous sites and systems that provide you more force to use.<br>
<br>
Keeping Endor - If your opponent has enough activation, they will be able to deploy their mains on Endor before you have the chance to reinforce your position.  If they cancel Establish Secret Base and Ominous Rumors early on, you will most likely struggle for the remainder of the game, as you will lose the main benefit of this deck type: increased force draining capability.<br>
<br>
<br>
Possible Strategies:<br>
<br>
Heavy ground, light space - This kind of Endor Operations deck uses Tempest Scouts and possibly bikes to control Endor, a few heavy hitters in space to keep Establish Secret Base on the table, and then uses other power cards such as Vader, Mara, IG-88 with Riot Gun, etc. to go where your opponent is and beat them down, while continuously draining away at Endor and any other sites of oppurtunity.	This strategy can prove effective as a surprise tool, as many players will not expect to play against Endor Operations.<br>
<br>
Light ground, heavy space - This deck is basically the exact opposite of the above deck type.  It utilizes Tempests to hold Endor and Ominous Rumors, and then uses heavy space to use the plus two force drain bonus provided by Rumors.  This deck type has a good chance of holding off many light side decks which now mainly focus on ground.  Throne Room mains will still give you a problem though, because of their early activation advantage.<br>
<br>
'I like the deck just because it has such a big drain in space. All I really do is go to space. The real reason I played the deck is because I noticed that everyone was playing ground decks.' &amp;#8211; Kyle 'Jedi.02' Craft<br>
<br>
<br>
Cards to include:<br>
<br>
Defense - Tempest Scouts, AT-ST pilots, Speeder Bikes, Biker Scout Troopers, etc.<br>
Vehicle / biker Helpers - Trample, Outflank, High Speed Tactics, Biker Scout Gear, etc.<br>
Space - numerous battleground sites, bounty hunters in ships, and star destroyers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall:<br>
<br>
Catch them off guard - If your opponent is not prepared to face an Endor Operations / Imperial Outpost deck, they may easily succumb to the damage inflicted by the force drain bonuses and their inability to modify or cancel your force drains on Endor, unless they react, at which point you can beat them down with Tempests.  However, if your opponent is prepared, or has a fair amount of luck and skill, they will be able to take control of Endor and keep you from reaping the rewards of Establish Secret Base and Ominous Rumors.  The best Endor Operations deck I have seen on DT belongs to Kyle 'Jedi.02' Craft.<br>

<br>
DS Objective #4 - Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi / Their Fire Has Gone Out of the Universe<br>
<br>
Front side - [Deploy Holotheatre and Visage of the Emperor. May deploy Meditation Chamber and/or Epic Duel.] {While} this side up, during your move phase, may use 4 Force to take Vader into hand from a location you control (cards on him go to owner's Used Pile). Add 4 to each player's destiny draw for Sense and Alter.  {Flip} this card if Vader is at a battleground site and no Light Jedi or Luke is at a battleground site.  {Place} out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site.<br>
<br>
Flip side -  {While} this side up, opponent cannot initiate battles or Force drains where opponent has a Jedi or Skywalker. You lose no Force from Visage of the Emperor. While Vader at Meditation Chamber, subtract 2 from each of opponent's battle destiny draws. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter.  {Flip} this card if opponent has Luke or a Jedi at a battleground site or if Vader is not on table.  {Place} out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site.<br>
<br>
Ah, Hunt Down, the bane of light side players everywhere.  Hunt Down is by far the most commonly used objective for the DS, and that is the reason why many LS players pack numerous cards for anti-HD, such as Glancing Blow, Transmission Terminated, Courage of a Skywalker, etc.  The reason for the increased amount of use for this objective is simple; it provide lots of activation, quick power, makes your opponent afraid to play Luke or Obi, and is overall a fun deck to play.  Hunt Down has, since its inception, spawned off into two distinct types of play.  These two types are simply dueling and non-dueling.  Based on the focus the player chooses, the cards that can go into this deck vary greatly.  The amount of play this objective receives has hardly changed over time, though perhaps it will after the release of Death Star II.  But for now, LS players must assume that they will see at least one, if not more, Hunt Down decks in every tournament they participate in.<br>
<br>
Looking at the front side, the power of this objective is easily seen.	You have the option of starting out with 3 icons, plus whatever your opponent gives you, while at the same time giving up nothing, which is a very powerful asset to any deck, light or dark.  You also start with Visage of the Emperor, which will begin to slowly drain both you and your opponent until you flip, at which point only your opponent is being hurt by Visage.  Visage is a potentially dangerous card for your opponent, as unless they cancel it with Transmission Terminated or by getting a character to the Holotheatre they will suffer from its damage throughout the course of the game.  You also have the option of putting out Epic Duel, which will enable you to duel Luke or Obi-Wan and severely hurt the light side, either by actually dueling, or making them avoid playing either of their jedi.  The next part of the front side is extremely useful, if costly, in the right situations.  If your opponent plays Uncontrollable Fury on Vader, simply pick him up from the table and Fury will go to your adversary's used pile.  You may then re-deploy Vader later on in the game, perhaps to a site where they have their jedi so that you can duel them.  The next major aspect of the front side of the card is addition of 4 to both players Sense and Alter draws.  This will prevent your opponent from canceling either key interrupts or effects, or reacts to a battle.  This is a double-sided sword though, and will also prevent you from doing the same.  One thing to keep in min is that if your opponent has a crucial effect that is aiding them throughout the game, you can always track a destiny 1 card and cancel it with Alter.  Just because you add four to the draws doesn't mean that it is impossible to pull it off.  The objective then flips if you have Vader at a battleground site and Luke or Obi isn't at one.	The objective is placed out of play if you play Screw, so no HD manipulation, initiate a non-epic duel, though many players do so and just get rid of the objective if they are struggling, or force drain on the Executor, which I haven't seen or heard of ever happening.<br>
<br>
Now on the back side, where even more of Hunt Down's benefits come into effect.  First, your opponent cannot initiate battles or force drains where they have a Jedi or Skywalker, which includes Obi-Wan, Luke, and Leia.  This helps you by preventing them from deploying the above characters to your twix sites and force draining you for massive amounts each turn.  If your opponent has Order to Engage out, as many LS decks do include, they will be on the receiving end of the damage taken by the effect.  Also, if used in conjunction with Much Anger in Him, you can potentially cause your opponent to lose 7 force for not battling you, assuming Order to Engage is out.  If not, then they still lose 4 force.  Ouch.  Next is the small but powerful fact that you no longer lose force from Visage of the Emperor.  This means your opponent will lose 1 force during each of your turns until they find a way to cancel Visage or flip your objective back.  This part of the objective right here is the reason most LS decks pack multiple copies of Transmission Terminated, since they don&amp;#8217;t want to lose unnecessary force.  They will however, generally allow Visage to remain on the table as long as you both are losing from it.  If you place Vader at the Meditation Chamber, your opponent's destiny draws are minus two.  Many players place Vader here after flipping (and if the LS doesn't have Luke or Obi out), because should your opponent flip your objective back, you will be able to once again pick Vader up for 4 force.  Next, the Sense and Alter restrictions are altered in your favor.  Instead of adding four to each destiny draw, your opponent can simply not use Sense and Alter; however, you can now play them normally, which gives you the benefit of being able to counter their important cards and reacts.  The objective then flips back if Vader is not on the table (so avoid losing him in battles) or if they have Obi or Luke at a battleground site.  That is one downside to the objective, that your opponent can easily flip back your objective.  I use 'can' for one simple reason: many players fear deploying Obi-Wan or Luke when facing HD, for fear of being dueled.  The objective is placed out of play for the same reasons as the front side.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benefits of the objective:<br>
<br>
What?  No Luke or Obi? - As I have stated several times in the above few paragraphs, many LS players simply refuse to deploy Luke or Obi-Wan for fear of a crippling duel that will most likely end with their loss of the game.  This is so powerful, seeing as how those two characters are questionable the best two characters the light side has in their arsenal.<br>
<br>
Force Loss - With Visage, duels, Much Anger in Him, and possibly Order to Engage if your opponent is foolish enough to play it, the LS will be struggling to keep themselves from losing massive amounts of force every turn.<br>
<br>
Sense and Alter hurting your deck?  No problem - your opponent will be hard pressed to complete sense and alter while the objective is on the 0 side, and they simply won't be able to use them once it is flipped.  Ever since the beginning of the game, Sense and Alter have been two of the most used cards in many decks, because they are so immensely powerful when used properly that it is not even funny.  If you face MYWHL, most likely neither of you will successfully complete a SA draw, unless you track a 1 once your objective is flipped.<br>
<br>
Generation - In the beginning, you give up no force.  There is no reason to do so during the remainder of the game either, as you can use one of their battleground sites to flip the objective, while you just dump out twix sites to generate massive amounts of force.<br>
<br>
<br>
Downsides of the objective:<br>
<br>
Too popular for its own good? - Hunt Down is so popular in every tournament scene that nearly all players pack at least four anti-HD cards: Transmission Terminated x2, Glancing Blow, and Courage of a Skywalker.  Some decks even include more Transmission Terminated's or a few spies so that they can cancel Visage.   A Glancing Blow or COAS could hurt a dueling HD deck, as the LS might swing the total in their favor.<br>
<br>
Is RTP making a comeback? -  Pending on the release of Third Anthology and Prisoner 2187, Rescue the Princess might make a strong comeback if it becomes plausible to easily (relatively) flip it, and this means that Hunt Down might take a serious blow.  If the LS battles and kills Vader and Mara once, there goes the objective.  Hunt Down will flip back, you won't be able to easily play Sense and Alter, and your two powerhouses are out.  Ouch.	I'm anxiously awaiting the release of 3A for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
Should you lose the duel - I don't suggest dueling until you have set up your destiny, or you know they have horrible draws, so this shouldn't happen, but if somehow you do lose a duel, you will be the one severely hurt, seeing as how your multiple copies of Vader are now wasted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Possible Strategies:<br>
<br>
Dueling - The first main branch of the objective (and actually less frequently played) involves actually using cards like Epic Duel, Vader's Obsession, The Circle is Now Complete, etc. and can be very powerful.  If you track your high destiny and duel your opponent, you can either make them lose Obi and 9 force or you gain Luke to use as your own and they lose 5 (most likely).  I have yet to hear of a player voluntarily losing 15 force just to keep Luke away from the dark side.  A winning duel early on can easily turn the tide of the game in your favor and keep the light side reeling from the early loss.  Conversely, a duel at the end of the game can finish off your opponent and thus win you the game.<br>
<br>
'It is advantaged versus Mains decks which is a predominant deck type. They have to be packing anti duel cards AND they have to draw them or they auto lose. I'm not a big fan of HD generally. It's not a great objective since it causes you to lose force sometimes. I play when the environment is conducive to playing it.' - Gabe 'The Diplomat' Alonso<br>
<br>
'What's not to like about it?' - Mike 'Faramir' Dalton<br>
<br>
Non-Dueling - Hunt Down can also be a very powerful tool when used as a bluff.	Just having the objective out will make any light side player wary to deploy Obi-Wan or Luke for fear of being dueled and beaten.  It is not unlikely to encounter a situation in which the LS won't deploy Obi-Wan or Luke, ever.  This will make your opponent essentially lose their two best characters, and besides Leia with Anakin's, the only characters able to utilize lightsabers.  (I'm not counting jedi lightsabers on people, because who actually uses those?)<br>
<br>
Manipulation - As I&amp;#8217;ve said before, it's possible.  It would be interesting to see a manipulation deck that also used dueling just in case their opponent does deploy Obi-Wan or Luke once they see you playing manip.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cards to include:<br>
<br>
Duelers: Vader x4 or 5, Mara x2, etc.  Just include multiple copies of the characters that can duel.<br>
Duel cards / helpers: Epic Duel, Vader's Obsession, The Circle is Now Complete, You are Beaten, Vader's Lightsaber, Mara's Lightsaber.<br>
Helpers: Visage of the Emperor x2 or more (it never hurts to have 7's floating throughout your deck), Much Anger in Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall:<br>
<br>
The power still rests with the dark jedi - Hunt Down is and will remain one of the most popular objectives utilized by dark side players.  It has excellent benefits and helpers, as well as easily overcome downfalls, but perhaps after the release of Third Anthology, Hunt Down may take another blow that might force players to begin using other objectives.  Remember that this is not the only objective out there, so don't necessarily consider this objective your only choice.  Some of the good Hunt Down deck-makers on DT include Michael 'Faramir' Dalton, Gabe 'The Diplomat' Alonso, and Scott 'CRingwell' Lingrell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, that wraps up the first installment.  To those of you who are miraculously still awake after all this, I hoped you enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
SPECIAL THANKS - For this installment, special thanks to: Tim 'Info Broker' Guzman, Kyle 'Jedi.02' Craft, Michael 'Faramir' Dalton, Gabe 'The Diplomat' Alonso, and anyone else who I somehow forgot that helped me on these objectives.<br>
