But as I was looking at the pictures of those that are considered the best in the game, I realized how little most of us probably now about them.  We copy their decks (and usually win big with them), but where does that deck come from, and who is the player behind it?<br>
<br>
I recently had a chance to communicate (via e-mail) with the Freedomcon Champion, Bastian Winkelhaus.  He and I discussed his history in the game, and also his dramatic Freedomcon victory.  At the time of this article, Bastian&#146;s rating is 2224, which makes him the fourth highest-rated player in the world.<br>
<br>
Bastian&#146;s first tournament was in January of 1997.  Back then there were no EPPs, no objectives, not even any starting interrupts.  In fact, the only expansions available were Premiere, A New Hope and Hoth, with  Dagobah coming later that year.  He went 2-2 that day.  Four years later, he won Freedomcon, a competition that many consider the World Championships.<br>
<br>
I had the opportunity to ask Bastian some questions about his playing, and this is what he had to say:<br>
<br>
JT: What do you think is the most valuable skill a Star Wars player can have?<br>
BW: A keen grasp of the obvious.  I&#146;m not doing any miracles.  Star Wars is a really complex game in the fact that you can make a lot of mistakes during the game.  So playing a game without making any mistakes is a skill already.  And in deckbuilding, I&#146;m just adding 1 and 1 together.  It&#146;s all there in front of you.<br>
<br>
JT: How often do you play in preparation for tournaments?<br>
BW: Back in the day (like a year ago) I had two very good friends, Martin Schuhmacher and Markus Wuest, who were also good players (partially because they played with me all the time.  :-) ) and we would meet two or three times a month to play Star Wars.  But they both quit the game cause they don&#146;t have the time anymore.  So I&#146;m playing a bit on the net, but that isn&#146;t the same.  So to answer your question: Lately, either once or not at all.<br>
<br>
JT: Going into the final match at Freedomcon, you knew what deck Martin was playing for dark side, but had no idea what to expect for his light side: what were your thoughts about the game when your dark deck faced off against his light?<br>
BW: I knew that he played lightsaber combat.  My deck has an advantage in that matchup.  And I knew I could beat his dark with QMC cause we played that game twice on Friday.  So I was confident.  But I didn&#146;t know any details about his deck.  I found out he played Sense/Alter, but I played There Is No Try before, although I didn&#146;t know.  I also played my Tramples correctly and did anticipate the right stuff.<br>
<br>
JT: Your dark deck is definitely one of the most original that has been seen in a while.  It&#146;s not often you see a non-objective dark deck that isn&#146;t heavily focused on Darth Maul.  What was the idea behind that deck, and why do you think it worked so well?<br>
BW: The original idea was Martin [Akesson]&#146;s.  I saw the power and recognized it.  We played over the net with it, before Reflections 3, and I knew it was good.  And I didn&#146;t have anything half decent besides that.  Let Martin tell you how he came up with it.<br>
<br>
JT: You are most famous for two very popular decks, the Watch Your Step beatdown and Brangus Glee.  What made you decide to choose such different decks to take to worlds?<br>
BW: Brangus is dead, cause of the shield.  Beatdown is dead, cause of the shield that kills Beggar.  So both decks were not available anymore.  I tested with my friend Angelo Consoli two weeks before in preparation for a tournament in the Netherlands.  I threw all kinds of decks against his QMC and kept losing.  So I decided to play QMC myself.  I stuck with that till worlds.  I played Senate in the Netherlands.  But I didn&#146;t really like it and it lost horribly to Lightsaber Combat.  So I changed that.<br>
<br>
JT: You have the distinct honor of being one of the few people who can say they have beaten Brian Hunter in Star Wars CCG.  What strategies did you use to defeat him in the semi-finals?<br>
BW: It was really easy.  He just drew and drew and complained about his draw.  When he finally had a good hand set up, I Grimtaashed him used.  It wasn&#146;t much of a game.<br>
<br>
JT: You come from a part of the world with some heavy-hitting players, such as Julien Riviere, Peter Di Biasio and Martin Falke, just to name a few.  What is it like constantly being up against the best, knowing you&#146;ll never have an easy tournament?<br>
BW: I don&#146;t really see these guys at my local.  Except of course Martin Falke.  He&#146;s like my arch-enemy cause we square off against each other every month.  The big events are always funny when you face the good players.  Lately Martin Falke had classes on Saturday, so he would be late for the local and start the tournament after game 1 or 2 [with a 0-1 or 0-2 record].  So it wasn&#146;t really that hard to win all these locals.  It&#146;s not like we don&#146;t have good players except Martin and me, but we are the elite.  And if the other elite player can&#146;t play me . . . So I was really looking forward to meeting players from other countries.  And I won against them too, so that was really nice.  At Continentals, the title defender wasn&#146;t there, Martin Akesson, but I settled that later on.  :-)  It was really sad that the other European big guns were not at Freedomcon, especially Julien Riviere and Martin Falke, but also Peter di Biasio.<br>
<br>
JT: It&#146;s been said that the main difference between European players and everyone else who plays the game is that Euro players start tracking their deck from the first turn of the game.  Do you think this is an accurate statement?<br>
BW: LOL, it&#146;s a myth.  I swear that I never really track my opponent&#146;s deck and I don&#146;t track my own destinies from turn 1 on.  Martin Falke does a lot of tracking, he&#146;s the best at that.  And I know for sure the Brits don&#146;t really track.<br>
<br>
JT: I&#146;ve been hearing about you for a long time.  This has been an incredible year for you, including first place at both Freedomcon and the European Championships, and third place at Ramapocon.  I remember seeing your decks in Scrye from several years ago.  When was the moment that you knew you were one of the best players in the world?<br>
BW: I guess the World Championship, 1997.  I qualified through winning the German Regional, which had 118 players, more than any other Star Wars tourney till that day.  We went to Norfolk with a total of five Germans qualified.  Four of us made it to the top 12.  And Philip Jacobs won it.  So me and the guys that I play on a regular basis dominated Worlds.  I felt pretty special there.<br>
<br>
JT: What advice can you give to budding Star Wars players who want to be &quot;the next Bastian Winkelhaus?&quot;<br>
BW: I&#146;m very sorry, but there&#146;s not much advice I can give.  As I said before, it&#146;s just about not making mistakes and playing the game [how] it&#146;s supposed to be played.  Practice as much as you can if you keep on making mistakes.<br>
