I have broken it down into four categories, before the tournament, during the tournament, after the tournament, and the jedi/padawan system.  And the allusions to war are intended :-).<br>
<br>
<br>
Before the tournament<br>
<br>
<br>
'Preparation is the war.  If done correctly, the outcome is not in question.'<br>
<br>
<br>
You must understand that most of the tournament is preparation, at home and with companions.  The actual playing time should pale in comparison to the time that you spend creating and testing your deck.  It does not do you any good to borrow a friend's deck at the last minute, as it will not improve your deck-building skills, which without you will be unable to do well at tournaments on a constant basis.  Instead, spend time perusing your cards, and make sure that you know what each card does.  This is one of the most important aspects of the game; the knowledge of each individual card and its ability and usefulness in various situations.  It belittles your preparation if you have cards in your deck that you do not know the uses for, and there are far more cards that could fit into that extra slot that could help your deck.  Also know the secondary uses of each interrupt or effect, because you never know when you just might need it.  But this is all generic, and I will break this section down to provide more depth and analysis.<br>
<br>
Reconnaissance is the first important factor to building your deck.  It does no good to make a revolution deck when every dark side deck in your area plays anti-revolution.  I suggest that you first scout surrounding tournaments and see what is being played.  Because you are not enrolled in the actual game playing, the competitors will most likely allow you to look at their decks and ask them questions about the strategy that they use.  This will allow you to compile a deck that provides counters for the most played decks, as well as a strategy that the aforementioned decks do not have their own counters for.  Using the unexpected may prove to be a winning factor, as your opponent will not have a way to stop you.  For instance, if the majority of your area's light side decks involve using starships with high immunities to attrition to harass and weaken your own fleet, add in a few Dengar in Punishing One's to remove that immunity.  Or if they do the same with characters, toss down 4-LOM with Concussion Rifle and laugh as their immunity disappears because of the concussion rifle.  This will allow you to counter their advantage and destroy their strategy.<br>
<br>
Now that you now know your enemy's forces and tactics, you may begin to construct your own deck.  Try as hard as you can to utilize your own cards, as it teaches you to make do with what you have.  If you lack certain cards, I suggest attempting to trade or purchase them via Decipher's trading and auction message boards.  If you are forced to use cards that you currently do not have, try to borrow them from people you know, as many players will not allow you to use substitutions in your deck.  Also, borrow these cards well in advance so that you can incorporate them into your deck before you play test it.<br>
<br>
Now that you have constructed your deck, the next important step is for you to play test your deck so that you can find its weaknesses before the tournament.  It is best for you to do this with a friend, as playing yourself is somewhat lacking.  Have your companion use various decks, and play them all.  This will allow you to test your strategy against various other strategies and decks.	If you notice that one of these decks in particular causes problems for you, you might want to add in some counters for that one so that if it is played at the tournament you will be able to adequately compete against it.  You might also want to play against another person, as everybody's style and technique for playing is different, based on their decks and their personality.  You must keep in mind, however, that even the most extensive of play testing will not guarantee a win at the tournament, but the more you test, the better you will probably do.	If you must, play test by yourself before you leave to go to the tournament.  To do this, simply pit your two tournament decks against each other.  The flaw in this is that you, of course, know what your 'opponent' will want to do, and what they have.  To overcome this, I suggest merely playing a few turns so you can see if there are some glaring faults that you did not catch during the original play testing.<br>
<br>
Now the time comes when you are at the tournament location, but it hasn't started yet.  Use this time to talk to some of the other players who you will be competing in a little while.  Don&amp;#8217;t act rude or arrogant, as these are the people that will teach you the most.  If you are new, these other, experienced players can teach you a lot.  I deal with this in my jedi/padawan system later on in the article.  You can also use this time to trade for some of those cards that you do need still for tournaments later to come.  At all of the ones I have been to, every player has brought their binder or box of rares so that they could get rid of some of their useless rares in exchange for those that they need.	Do the same, as it provides the opportunity to expand upon your resources.<br>
<br>
This concludes the first section.  Now on to the next.<br>
<br>
<br>
During the tournament<br>
<br>
'Arma virumque cano'<br>
-Publius Vergilius Maro<br>
<br>
Now that the tournament has started, there are many rules and a code of conduct that you should follow.  I'll start with these before going more in depth about different attributes of the tournament itself.<br>
<br>
The rules of the tournament are nearly the same as playing a game with friends, though with slight differences.  The objective, of course, is to win, but in a tournament it is to win by the highest differential.  You need to be able to win by more than a few force each game if you are to finish first or at least within the top three.  Because the differential matters, if you lose one game barely, you can still make up for it by winning big against another opponent.  The rest of the rules are the same, and I will not go in depth about them.<br>
<br>
Now for the code of conduct.  These are rules that I feel should take precedence for any player, experienced or not, should strive to accomplish.  They are in no particular order, as I feel they are all necessary for the tournament to be as enjoyable as possible.<br>
<br>
1) Have fun, above all else.  Even if you lose, joke with your opponent, or at least try to hold a conversation with him during the game.  As long as you are having fun, the outcome of the tournament is inconsequential.  If you don't have fun, you might as well not go, because the major aspect of the tournament is lost on you.<br>
<br>
2) Don't whine or complain.  Even if you have lost every game, it is inappropriate to pout or constantly complain that everyone is playing harder against you, or whine that you're new and that you wish everybody would go easy on you.  I've played at tournaments where people actually did these, and all they accomplished was for the remaining players to become angered.<br>
<br>
3) Don't slander your opponent.  If you win big against a new player who obviously didn't know what he was doing or what the capabilities of his deck were, don't make fun of him and lower his self-esteem.  Everyone has gone through at least one humiliating defeat, and at that time they did not want to be ridiculed.  Instead, point out to the player where he erred in his judgement or misplayed a card.	I'll explain this more in the jedi/padawan section of my article.<br>
<br>
4) Don't cheat.  There is no reason that you should belittle the aspect of the game by cheating.  All it does is tell yourself that your skills are not adequate to win by normal means at the tournament.  You don't need this, as it can damage your future at any tournaments.  And if you are caught, there is a good chance that not only you'll be kicked out of the tournament, but you might be banned from the store and unable to play there or at another tournament that involves some of the same people.<br>
<br>
5) And if you still want to cheat...don't.  There is still no reason to make cheating acceptable.  Don't cheat.  I cannot overemphasize this rule of conduct.  (I have added this section because of the outstanding majority of tournament articles in which the authors gives players tips on how to properly cheat).<br>
<br>
6) Keep trying.  Even if you lose badly your first few tournaments, you will get better in time.  Keep going and playing, and eventually you'll make your way to the top of your region.  Who knows, you might even earn yourself that seat at World's.<br>
<br>
Follow these above steps and I guarantee that you will enjoy yourself at the tournament.  I will now point out other aspects of the game during the tournament.<br>
<br>
'Beware the fury of a patient man'<br>
-John Dryden<br>
<br>
Patience is a virtue that should not be underestimated.  If you use it, there is a good chance that you can win against a rash opponent.<br>
<br>
What I mean by patience is simple.  Even if you lose a big battle and are down against your opponent, do not make rash choices and desperation fights where everything depends upon destiny (double meaning intended) or your opponent's blunder in the heat of the moment.  Instead, take your time and plan out your attack, and how you can draw them into a confrontation where they will lose without a doubt.  Look at your opponent's strategy and what you think they will most likely do in a given situation.  Use their strategy to their advantage.  Do whatever you can to get in one battle that either evens out the odds or sways them to your advantage.  The only way to do this is through patience.  Utilize it to its utmost.  Unfortunately, I cannot give a good example, because there isn't one.  Every game is different, and every player is different.  The course of the game dictates the actions that you must take in order to win.<br>
<br>
Now the tournament ends.  For many players, it truly is the end of their experience.  But there is more to the game, more to the tournament that is necessary for you to look at to be as successful as possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
After the game<br>
<br>
'An error is a mistake only if you do not learn from it.'<br>
<br>
The above quote is nearly self-explanatory.  If you make bad plays or errors during the tournament, the best thing to do is to learn from it so that it doesn't happen again.	These errors are compounded if you continuously repeat them as you are proving that you don't care enough to change your tactics to avoid unnecessary mistakes.  For instance, if you lose the game because you weren't aware of the game text of a certain card, there is a really good probability that you will make sure to look at all of your opponent's cards during the next tournament that you play in.<br>
<br>
Besides just learning from the mistakes that you make, there are others aspects to the tournament after it is completed.  One of these is the revamping and editing of your deck and strategy.	If one of your decks did horrible and lost every game, it will be a good idea to change it or at least alter your strategy to take into account the capabilities of the decks that you faced and lost against.	Conversely, if one of your decks wins nearly all the time, keep the same cards in, but perhaps change your strategy when you face one of the decks that perhaps you barely defeated.  I guarantee you that every player in World's (those of you on Decktech that have been there, back me up) edits their deck after each day/tournament so that they can possibly win by a better differential so that you can place high.  This philosophy should be the same for all players, as it is an important part of any tournament.<br>
<br>
And do you know where you go from here?  That's right.  You go back to the information I provided in the Before the tournament section, and do the same for any and all subsequent tournaments that you attend.  No matter how experienced you are, there is no reason why you should not prepare for the games that you will play.  And this concludes the basics of the tournament.	One more section to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Jedi/Padawan System<br>
<br>
I could use the Vader/Obi-Wan quote, but I don't know the exact wording and I really don't want a critique on that, so I'll just skip it :-)<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should explain what I mean by this system.  It is basically the same as it is for the jedi.  I'm sure all of you have seen Episode 1 (if not, I pity you), and you know that a jedi takes a padawan learner to teach, and when that padawan is ready, he becomes a jedi, and eventually a jedi master, and he/she takes upon their own padawan.<br>
<br>
The same should be true for tournaments.  When you are first new to a tournament, you will most likely find somebody who you can talk and who will point out mistakes you made and points on your strategy.  This, of course, is dependent on your actions and the following of the code of conduct.  This person is then, in essence, your jedi.  He teaches you, and points out the bigger mistakes, while allowing you to practice and hone the smaller parts of the game, i.e. micro-strategies and the way that you play them.  This is slightly different from the jedi/padawan system in that it is possible and acceptable to have more than one mentor to help you.  This allows you to get the opinions of others, which can only prove to help you.<br>
<br>
But now they are done teaching you.  They don't have to point out your mistakes anymore, and you can talk strategy with them as their peer.  It is now time to become that jedi, and take upon your own padawan.  When you play a new or inexperienced player, don't ridicule them or laugh at them, but help them as those others helped you.  Nothing proves your good sportsmanship or integrity better than knowing that you are helping another.  Do the same things that those others did for you, as it can only provide a more solid foundation to the game.	This is the essence of the jedi/padawan system.<br>
<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that these past sections have helped all of you, new or old, who are planning to go to another tournament.  If you try to follow these steps, I assure that you will do better, and have more fun at the same time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and happy gaming!<br>
