Brian has been the number one player on Star Wars CCG for longer than I&#146;ve even been playing the game - over three years.  Every one of his decks has been highly acclaimed, and he has almost 800 tournament games under his belt with a rating of 2303.  With numbers like that, it&#146;s not hard to believe that Brian best represents the heart and soul of the Star Wars community.<br>
<br>
Because of the distance between us, I have never actually had the opportunity to play Brian myself, but one of the top players from my area played Brian at Freedomcon.  Out of several games, Brian never came close to losing, and I still hear about the cold calculation Hunter uses to get consistent double-digit wins.  How do you beat a player that doesn&#146;t make mental mistakes?  The answer is, you don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
You can imagine the amount of mail Brian gets from Star Wars CCG players looking for advice.  However, he was able to make some time in his schedule to answer some questions about the past, present and future of his involvment in Star Wars.<br>
<br>
JT: How long have you been playing the game?<br>
BH: Longer than most.  I was playing sanctioned tournaments back in the days when there was nothing but Premiere.  So I have gotten to see the impact made by the introduction of each new expansion set, from A New Hope forward.<br>
<br>
JT: What do you think is the most valuable skill a Star Wars player can have?<br>
BH: For the average player, the most valuable skill would probably be . . . knowing how to talk to women.  That really lays the groundwork for everything else that you are trying to accomp- . . . Oh, Star Wars player?  Hmm, I guess the most important thing is knowing which cards to deploy, where to deploy them, and when.  Do I deploy to space, deploy to ground, save force, draw cards?  If I deploy to ground, do I deploy to my turf or theirs?  The vast majority of SWCCG games hinge on these types of decisions.  And the players who win most often are the ones who have a natural feel for which choice is best at any given time, without really having to expend time or effort thinking about it.<br>
<br>
JT: How often do you play outside of tournaments?<br>
BH: Not often at all.  Most SWCCG players probably playtest their decks a LOT more than I do.  I rarely practice, and even more rarely find time to play games &quot;just for fun.&quot;  I can say with absolute certainty that more than 50% of all the games of Star Wars I have ever played were sanctioned tournament games.<br>
<br>
JT: You took Dark Deal and Watch Your Step as your decks to Freedomcon.  What was the reasoning behind using those decktypes?<br>
BH: Dark Deal was strong against WYS, and practically auto-wins over QMC and Lightsaber Combat.  I expected all 3 of those decktypes to be popular for lightside, so Dark Deal seemed like a good choice.  Also, Dark Deal is not an extremely popular decktype worldwide, so many players would not have nearly as much experience against it as they would against say . . . Hunt Down.  On the other hand, most players DO have a lot of experience vs. WYS.  But I chose to play WYS anyway, simply because it has much greater versatility and balance than Throne Room Mains or Lightsaber Combat, which were the other 2 light decks I strongly considered.  The decks I used at Freedomcon were designed to really take advantage of the Battle Plan/Battle Order defensive shields, by having excellent fighting capabilities both on the ground and in the air.<br>
<br>
JT: When you faced off against Bastian in the semi-finals, it looked like you had a deck advantage.  What were you thinking before the game started?<br>
BH: I was thinking that since Martin was using LS Lightsaber Combat, and Hayes was using Hunt Down, Martin would probably choose to use light in that match, and that he would probably win.  So, figuring that Martin would defeat Hayes in the other semifinal match, I began thinking about what strategy I would use against Martin in the final.  I was fairly sure that my Dark Deal would walk all over his saber combat, since he just would not be able to keep up with the 12-16 damage I can force every turn, especially when I use the Battle Order shield to slow him down.  Beating his dark deck would be tougher, since it was a pretty good anti-WYS design.  I figured superiority in space would be the key, and that I would have to use my best anti-cannon tricks to keep the Baron from taking me down.  The possibility of losing the semi-final match to Bastian had not really occurred to me at all, since he had chosen to use QMC against my Dark Deal, and the odds of a QMC deck winning that matchup are so incredibly miniscule that they did not really seem worth considering.<br>
<br>
JT: You seemed to have some trouble in that final game.  Did your deck just not perform like it was supposed to?<br>
BH: To say that my deck did not perform would be a vast understatement.  Not only had the Dark Deal never failed me so miserably before, but I do not think ANY deck has ever failed me so miserably before.  If Bastian himself had selected the 8 cards for my opening draw, and then carefully chosen exactly which cards I would activate each turn, and in exactly which order . . . I still do not think things could have possibly gone any worse than they did.  Bastian did not have to do anything that game but sit back and watch my deck kill me.  In that game, my deck was pure and concentrated Hunter-Kryptonite, and I was completely powerless to do anything at all.<br>
<br>
JT: You have been the number one-ranked player for a long, long time, yet some consider your rating a fluke.  Did you feel you had something to prove at Freedomcon?<br>
BH: No, I had absolutely nothing to prove at Freedomcon.  I have not bought a new video-game console since the SNES, since I do not usually have a lot of time to play video games, and it just did not seem worth the money.  But the home video games of today are a lot better than what they used to be, and playing a few Playstation 2 games at the houses of my friends had me thinking that I really needed to pick one up, because it was just too much fun to pass up.  Freedomcon offered me the chance to win a PS2, along with a Gamecube, and games for each, and I knew that my travel costs would be a lot less than what it would cost me to buy those items.  And although I had no use for a new television, I could sell it if I were to win one, and come out even farther ahead.  Some people might have SAID my rating was a fluke, but I do not see how anyone could have actually believed that.  A guy whose rating is a fluke does not remain the #1 player in the world for over 3 years.  A guy whose rating is a fluke does not win major events like a Grand Slam, or a DPC, or a World Championship Open . . . much less all 3 of them.  And the results from Freedomcon are just another example of how the rating system does a good job of indicating who the strong players are.  If you look at the current top 4 players in the world, 3 of them attended Freedomcon.  And all 3 of them finished in the top 4 of Freedomcon.  That says a LOT.  The other player who finished in the top 4 at Freedomcon is also ranked in the top 10.  And EVERY player who made the top 8 at Freedomcon is also rated over 2000.  There were not any unknown players who came out of nowhere to blindside the elite and take the prize.<br>
<br>
JT: You and hayes Hunter seem to have somewhat of a rivalry going on.  With him recently moving into the number two-rated spot, and then moving into your area of the U.S., do you think you will have trouble staying as the number-one player?<br>
BH: The fact that Hayes has moved to a neighboring state will not make it any easier for him to catch me, nor will it make it any harder.  And having a rivalry with the #2-ranked player is not anything new.  Kyle Craft and Clint Hays each worked long and hard at trying to pass me when they were ranked #2, and each of them had a LOT of things to say about me while in that position.  They both reached #2 more than once, but neither was able to get to #1.  Will Hayes?  Only time will tell.  But his move to Arizona does not worry me.  I really would not care that much if I lost the #1 spot.  It is not as important to me as many people seem to think.  But I have no reason to believe I will lose it anytime soon.  I lost quite a few rating points at Freedomcon, but so did Hayes.  We both moved down closer to the rest of the field, but he did not really make any progress toward catching me.  I have gone 18-0 in sanctioned play since Freedomcon, and if Hayes has continued to play, I assume he has experienced similar results.  We will probably both work to undo the damage caused by our disappointing performances at Freedomcon, and I think it is likely that we will remain the top 2 players for a while.<br>
<br>
JT: Your decks are some of the simplest on decktech.  The average person can play them, and be successful with them.  This is one of the reasons that I&#146;m always sure to see at least a couple of &quot;Hunter decks&quot; at each tournament.  How do you explain the fact that while other people are trying to find the most lethal card combinations to make the most &quot;tech&quot; decks, you keep with your basic ideas - and beat almost everyone you play?<br>
BH: In general (and of course there are exceptions to every rule), I prefer to use cards that are strong on their own merits, rather than rely on ones that are only good in combination with something else.  If all of your cards are good, and useful, then it does not matter as much which ones you get, and you cut down on the random luck element of the game.  The less luck that is involved in a match, the more I like it.  My decks are usually designed to be consistant, reliable and resilient.  They compensate for speed and cheese, and try to turn the match into a thinking game.  They can survive early damage, survive bizarre tricks and combos, establish board control, and eventually put the opponent in a situation where defeat is the only option.<br>
<br>
JT: I think it&#146;s fair to say that your ISB Big Blue deck is your most popular to date.  It changed the way light players built their decks.  Where did this idea come from, and what do you think makes it so powerful?<br>
BH: ISB Big Blue accomplishes all of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  It is consitent and reliable.  Blizzard Walkers and Star Destroyers are bound to be resilient.  Having pilots that you can retrieve when they are forfeited only makes it even more impossible to wear you down.  With Vader, Tarkin, Walkers and expendable pilots, occupying a single battleground site is not too difficult, and when you do so, the objective cripples the drains at every related location your opponent controls.  The Undercover spies and the Den Of Thieves, combined with Imperial Decree, further guarantee that ground drains will be a non-factor.  If you can negate ground drains, and are invincible in space, then what happens?  You win.  The deck takes away all of the ways your opponent could beat you.  And if your opponent cannot win the game, then there is only one person left who can.<br>
<br>
JT: What advice can you give people who want to be able to compete at the top level of play?<br>
BH: Try to become smarter?  Truly, the players with the most success will usually be the players with most intelligence, OR the players who have a natural knack for strategy and tactics, OR the players who are luckiest.  Notice how none of these are something that the person can control.  Nobody can teach someone else who to have an aptitude for this game.  Either it is there, or it is not.<br>
