     They all look really cool. There's just something about ships shooting at each other that makes a really nice card graphic.<br>
     I remember hearing some spoilers, and some people saying you could build a deck around an Admiral's Order. I don't think they an AO alone is enough to base a deck around, they can certainly augment a strategy if you bear one in mind when building your deck.<br>
     Most people know by now that there can be only one Admiral's Order on the table, for you and your opponent. For these reason, it's usually worth packing your own Admiral's Order no matter what kind of deck your playing simply to deny your opponent the benefits of his order. Fortunately, all Admiral's Orders are destiny 6 cards.<br>
     Many Admiral's Orders give benefits to sites realted to a system you occupy or control. This benefits many decks, such as Rebel Strike Team, Quiet Mining Colony, and Occupation/Celebration decks.<br>
     To see what Admiral's Orders are the best for each decks, I'll take a more in depth look.<br>
<br>
Fighters Coming In/I'll Take the Leader<br>
&quot;Unique starfighters without permanent pilots are immune to attrition&lt;4 (or add 2 to immunity if starfighter already has immunity). Starships without pilot characters aboard are power -2. At docking bays related to systems you occupy, your force drains are +1. Once per turn, your starfighter just lost from a system may be relocted to a related docking bay.&quot;<br>
<br>
      This is the anti-permanent pilot AO. If you fear the EBH ships, stock this card. This is just one of the reasons we seem to be on a trend to put pilots on their matching ships; this AO will give your typical pilot/ship pair immunity to attrition of less than 6! This is good because it keeps your pilots around, who often have great game text (Baron Fel or Wedge, for example).  Also, you get a &quot;bacta tank&quot; for your ships at docking bays if they crack that immunity (or use weapons). You'd better have a traditional bacta tank for the pilot, though, or at least a replacement.<br>
      This is probably the best AO for the LS if the Dark Side is still relying on the EBH ships in space, but it's also useful to counter non-unique swarms; your opponent needs to have Organized Attack and Incom just to get them back to their usual power! It's perfect in an MBO deck, which needs starfighters with pilot characters anyway, and the &quot;bacta&quot; is especially useful to places that can have two docking bays, like CC or Tatooine.<br>
     The biggest downside is that not be hosed by it yourself, your space fleet must consist largely of starfighters with matching pilots, which is certainly viable now because of squadron assignments but can take up more than its fair share of card space if you just want to protect one system. Fortunately, you still have the pilot characters who can be used on the ground because of their (often) IAO-pumpable forfeit. If you think the biggest threat to Bespin (or Endor, or Yavin, or wherver you're celebrating/occupying) to be EBH ships or non-unique swarm, it's worth setting up.<br>
<br>
Fighter Cover/Concentrate All Fire<br>
    &quot;Each starfighter that fires a weapon in battle is power +3 for remainder of battle. Once per turn you may cance; and redraw your starship weapon destiny just drawn. At sites related to systems you occupy, your characters who have immunity to attrition each add 2 to immunity and 1 to each of that character's weapon destiny draws.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Probably the most flexible Admiral's Order, as it provides no penalties and only one bonus that applies to both players. This is probably the best AO to pack to hurt your opponent's strategy.<br>
     This is also the best for the determined swarmer to get rid of the AO I just talked about =). X-Wing Cannons or the DS version (on Interceptors, finally) are just nasty anyway, and this gives you a power bonus for using them and gives you a second chance to hit. If you can't figure out what AO to use but you're using starfighters with weapons, this is a safe bet.<br>
     It's ground effect is also extremely powerful; obviously, the mains on the ground benefit. In general, the LS can exploit this more because the DS tends to use combat vehicles for immunity. The added immunity extremely powerful when coupled with Rebel Strike Team or Quiet Mining Colony, which give scouts and aliens, respectively, immunity&lt;4. With immunity&lt;6, your opponent will be hard-pressed to clear out Bespin or Endor. As for the weapons adding function, many of the rebel scouts work well with blasters, and you can use Slight Weapons Malfunction to add a destiny if you fire a weapon in ground OR space. Yet another reason why RST is playable now.<br>
<br>
Capital Support/We're in Attack Position Now<br>
&quot;Each pilot deploys -1 (or -2 if an admiral) aboard a capital starship. Each capital starship with a pilot character aboard is immune to attrition&lt;4 (or add 2 to immunity if starship already has immunity). During each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 force for each battleground site your general controls that is related to a system you occupy.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Note that the DS card text is &quot;general or commander&quot;.<br>
     IMO, the best AO for Big Blue, whether its good old star destroyers and Mon Cals. Giving a deploy bonus to pilots and admirals is useful because big ships can hold lots of pilots, and since these ships have high deploy for low ability the pilot are often needed to get the magic number of four (or seven nowadays =)). SDs have always suffered from a lack of immunity, and this, along with Kuat Drive Yards, can give them immunity befitting such a massive ship.<br>
     To get the most, you'll want to pack lots of Admirals. Fortunately, DSII adds quite a few: Ackbar, Piet, and Chiraneau (who should be a natural for Big BLue). Also, there's Ozzel, and Motti who deploys for essentially free is you have 2 imperial ships on table! Since you have all these admrials, Imperial Command/Rebel Leadership can be very useful, especially since they can stop the multiple battle destinies required to take out these ships. A flipping Set Your Course deck with this AO, Admiral C, Kuat, the new-and-nasty SDs with Imperial Commands would be extremely hard to stop.<br>
     The ground benefit is unique among AOs because this is the only AO that does direct damage. RST can set up some extra damage because they're already likely packing Madine, Solo, and possibly Obi and Calrissian (people who have dissed GS1, bear in mind that you can set it up while Leia and Han are on the ground). The DS has Veers, Igar, and even Tagge. This can be used in an occupation deck to do even more direct damage, and you can even set up a high immunity cap ship to defend the system. Remember what I said about Rebel Leadership/Imperial Command? Generals and Commanders can use them, too. Now you can get more mileage out of the system than simply keeping occupation/celebration around.<br>
<br>
Intensify The Forward Batteries/Taking Them With Us<br>
&quot;Each player, if that player has a capital starship armed with a weapon in a battle, draws one battle destiny if not able to do otherwise and, once per battle, may reduce the defense value of one opponent's capital starship present by 4 for remainder of the battle. At sites related to systems you occupy, your non-pilot warriors are deploy -1, defense value +2, and forfeit +1.&quot;<br>
<br>
   The &quot;Big Blue with guns&quot; Ao, this AO also solves the problem of low ability by giving another way to draw destiny. Reducing the armor by 4 is enough to hit most ships with the new turbolaser, and even the Executor is in range (two fives or better). This AO gives a Big Blue deck with weapons a big advantage over one without, especially since capital starships are often stuffed with forfeit fodder. Pack the weapons and SE support cards and you'll do better than someone who's just devoted the card space to extra ships (and you'll have better destiny). Still, in general, We're In Attack Position and Capital Support are the best AOs for Big Blue; pull out Intensify/Taking Them when your dealing with a Big Blue deck that doesn't have weapons (likely in the case of a deck that has to devote lots of cards to something else, like EBO or Endor Ops).<br>
     The ground benefit is very good, but realize that most of the mains are pilots. There are a few exceptions, like Obi and the Emporer, but this benefit really shines with hordes of non-uniques, like Eloms or troopers. This can make setting up TDIGWATT with CC Troopers very viable, as they deploy for cheaper, handle attrittion better and are no longer such weapon bait. RST gets pumped (again) because many RST rebels don't have pilot and get a forfeit bonus from Insurrection (Noble Sac, anyone)? You can even use it to give yuor Ewoks a boost so Dr. E doesn't tear them apart so easily.<br>
<br>
Battle Deployment/Combined Fleet Action<br>
&quot;At each system where any player does not have both a starfighter and a capital starship present, that player's starships there are power -2. At sites related to ssytems you occupy, during each battle opponent may draw no more than one battle destiny. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one combat vehicle from your reserve deck; reshuffle.&quot;<br>
<br>
     This is a versatile hoser as it hurts both fighter swarms and Big Blue; bear in mind, though, that TIE swarms usually have capital ships for movement and LS Big Blue will probably still have the superfalcon. You don't absolutely need a space force capable of fulfilling the requirements; with the power penalty, you may be able to fight back against space decks with Counter/Suprise Assault! If you're building an all-around space fleet by just taking the best of what you perceive to be both types of ships, this AO will help balance it against the support cards more focused decks bring to bear.<br>
     This AO also shuts down multi-destiny madness at sites related to systems you occupy, giving you a bit more destiny to spread and drain. This hurts enhanced characters, but it also provides shelter from the Emporer's Power. This is a great AO to use if you like to hurt your opponent's capabilities.<br>
     It provides one benefit: the deployment of combat vehicles from the reserve deck. The DS has a better deal, here. Flipping Endor Ops suddenly becomes much better, as you have one less component you need to draw. Decks that are using groundside big blue also get a big of a speed boost; maybe Walker Garrison is fast enouugh to compete and anti-EBO meta, to boot. This also pumps a deck that seems to have changed little with DSII, RallOps, but it can make it harder to set up Imperial Decree if the RallOps player doesn't plan for space. The LS gets its speeders, and although the Ops part of SpeederOps is really dead, it's still possible to do the RFC/Tessek thing on Tatooine; you don't even need a space component for this part, although you might want to set it up anyway to restrict destiny and even get some Celebration going.<br>
<br>
	Thank you for reading this entire article. I hope you are able to see what you can do with AOs, and what impact an AO can have on the game. When you build a deck and are putting togethor your space fleet, remember to take the AO into account.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1531"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1531"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1531" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
