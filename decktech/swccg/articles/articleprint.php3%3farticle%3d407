There are two distinct components to the deck evolution process that take place here at Decktech. The first is deck submission, while the second is deck review. Decktech would not work without either critical process.  In fact, the process of review is wholly dependent upon the process of submission.  That is to say, we can only review material if there is a player submitting material for review.<br>
<br>
Decktech has had no problems obtaining submission recently.  In fact, it seems that due to the recent change in deck rating policy there has been an increase in the number of unrated decks in the queue.  The reason for this is simply because there are now fewer players rating decks.    This is what players wanted so as to improve the quality of the reviews and the submissions.  Thus, the problem is that there are fewer reviewers, meanwhile the number of submissions has remained the same or increased.  If we are to continue to make Decktech a top notch deck development site, then those of us who are members must step up to the challenge of reviewing more submissions, especially deck submissions.  So if your Decktech rating is high enough, then join us and get out there and review some submissions!<br>
