First, for those who are unfamiliar with this objective, or just need something to jog your memory, here is the game text.<br>
<br>
Bring Him Before Me (0) / Take Your Father's Place (7) - Rare<br>
Objective<br>
FRONT<br>
Deploy Throne Room, Insignificant Rebellion, and Your Destiny.<br>
For remainder of game, Scanning Crew may not be played. Opponent's cards that place a character out of play may not target Luke. You may deploy Emperor (deploy -2) from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent may deploy Luke from Reserve Deck (deploy -2; reshuffle) or Lost Pile. If Luke present with Vader and Vader is not escorting a captive, Luke is captured and seized by Vader. Vader may not transfer Luke.<br>
Flip this card if Luke captured.<br>
BACK<br>
While this side up, lose 1 Force at end of each of your turns. Once during each of your turns, when Vader, Luke (even as a non-frozen captive) and Emperor are all present at your Throne Room, you may initiate a Luke/Vader duel: Each player draws two destiny. Add ability. Highest total wins. If Vader wins, opponent loses 3 Force. If Luke wins, shuffle Reserve Deck and draw destiny; if destiny &gt; 12, Luke crosses to Dark Side, totally depleting opponent's Life Force.<br>
Flip if Luke neither present with Vader nor a captive<br>
<br>
The location deployed with this objective lends the dark side player two icons without giving away any, a good start for any deck.  It also packs a handy immunity to Revolution and the ability to pull the Emperors Power from Reserve Deck once per game, also good.  They also get two effects without the aid of a Starting Interrupt, they read as follows:<br>
<br>
&amp;#61623; Insignificant Rebellion (4) - Uncommon<br>
&quot;Your fleet is lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice.&quot;<br>
Effect<br>
Use 2 Force to deploy on table. Each time you win a battle, opponent loses 1 Force (cannot be reduced) and stacks lost card here face down. When attempting to cross Luke over (except with Epic Duel), add 3 to total destiny for each card in stack. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
&amp;#61623; Your Destiny (0) - Common<br>
Luke's destiny lies with his father, Darth Vader. To become a Jedi Knight, Luke must accept this.<br>
Effect<br>
Deploy on Bring Him Before Me. When Vader is present at a battleground site, at start of your turn opponent loses 3 Force unless Luke is captured, out of play, or present at a battleground site. Also, Luke is immune to Responsibility Of Command. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
Right away this deck looks to play similarly to Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi, with a major focus on winning battles.	The first line of the zero side of the objective discourages manipulation, just like Hunt Down.  On the front side there is also a line that reads Opponents cards that place a character out of play may not target Luke.  The only thing I can think of that this cancels is Noble Sacrifice, and there wouldnt be much of a point in placing Luke out of play against this deck.  You may deploy Emperor (deploy 2) from Reserve Deck: reshuffle.  Wow, I get out a guy right away that adds me an icon, is power 4, ability 7 and immune to attrition!  Count me in.  Dark Side can get him out first turn from Reserve Deck, unless the LS starts Goo Nee Tay.  Opponent may deploy Luke 2 from Reserve deck or from Lost Pile.  Thats not good, but now we each will have a main on the table.  Vader captures Luke when they are present with each other.  When this happens, the objective flips.  Now the Dark Side has Vader who can still battle, and the Light Side has Luke who is a helpless captive of daddy dearest.  Things are not looking good for the Light Side.<br>
<br>
On the 7 side, the Dark Side loses 1 force at the end of each of their turns, sounds good so far if youre the Rebels.  Once each turn, the Dark Side can have Luke and Vader duel, each drawing two destiny and adding ability to determine the winner.  If Vader wins, the Light Side loses three force.  If they dont get three battlegrounds occupied, Honor knocks it down to one force.  You can deal with it, but it will take its toll.	To avoid this you have to win the duel, in which case the Dark Side has the chance to cross Luke and win the game hands down.  It doesnt matter if your draining for seven a turn and are way ahead on life force, you lose and theres no getting around it.  However, for the Empire to turn Luke theyll have to win some battles.  With the Emperors Power adding a battle destiny, it gets easier, especially when the Rebels wont have Luke to fight with, for the most part.<br>
<br>
Right now, is our most desperate hour.	We have to beat this deck before all light decks become powerless against it.  Well start by looking at a sample Bring Him Before Me/Take Your Fathers Place deck and analyzing how it plays, then building off its weaknesses.  Please do not rate this article upon the quality of this deck, as it is just a sample used not to win tournaments but rather to give the reader an idea of what theyre up against.<br>

<br>
	This is how the first turn usually goes.  Before they activate, pull Emperors Power (Throne Room text) and Rendili (Mobilization Points).  Activate 3+ whatever Light Side gives them, deploy Rendili, deploy Emperors Power.  Search Reserve Deck for Death Star II: Docking Bay, deploy it (with IAO) and deploy Emperor there from Reserve Deck (BHBM text).  If there is any remaining force, they usually draw it.  Second turn, activate 9 force (2 at the Throne Room, 3 at the Docking Bay (+2 for Mobilization Points because the Emperor is there), 2 at Rendili, 1 for the Emperor and one for themselves.  Search Reserve Deck, deploy a Docking Bay, deploy Vader there and maybe another scrub.  Third turn, activate 12 or more force.you get the idea.	It generates a massive amount of force in a small amount of time, similar to Throne Room but this is nearly automatic and can happen 99% of the time.  Over the course of the game they drain you and cause you force loss from Your Destiny.  Once you deploy against them, they use their massive activation advantage to deploy a large hit squad and beat you down, gaining a card under Insignificant Rebellion.  So we now have to find a way to overcome this deck, weve got some work to do.<br>
<br>
	The first thing you might notice about this deck is the serious emphasis on Vader.  Most of the rest of the deck is based around him.  Vader is the head and the rest of the characters are the body, if you cut off the head, the body is useless.  There is one major problem with this, you cant use Luke to battle Vader.  To get Vader and his cronies out, the Dark Side needs activation.  So if we can slow down their activation, the rest of the deck will suffer.  The major way to do this is to give them no force, probably starting with a twix site.  Now you dont want this twix site to have nothing to do with your deck, and it should probably help you in some way.  The obvious choice is Yodas Hut, but it wont help your strategy much other than the fact that it provides a risk free 2-0 site.  Im going to go with Obi-Wans Hut, since without Luke, Obi-Wan will be your main battler (more on this later).  Now we have a Location to start with, lets go ahead and pick out a starting effect/interrupt.  What better way to slow down Vader, The Emperor and the other big guns than to start Goo Nee Tay?  With the Emperor deploying for five from the Reserve Deck (a whopping 7 from hand) and us giving them no icons, they dont get Emperor out first turn, no way, no how.  Instead of the intimidating 9 force on the second turn, they get 1 from the Throne Room, 2 from Rendili, 1 from the Death Star II: Docking Bay and 1 for themselves, giving them a total of 6 force on the second turn.  Its sounding a little better now isnt it?	Goo Nee Tays major flaw is that its not immune to Alter, so we can pack some Sense/Alter, it doesnt have to be heavy, but look at all of the Dark Side interrupts and effects used in the sample deck that arent immune to Sense/Alter.  With them generating six on the second turn, with Goo Nee Tay still out theyll have to pay at least five of it for Emperor, leaving them only one force, not enough to do much with.  Third turn theyll get nine, and wasting eight of it on Vader (10 for Lord Vader) they will again be stuck with one lousy force, again not enough to do anything major with.  I think you can see where this is going.<br>
<br>
	By slowing their activation down a bit at the opening stages of the game, you have opened up a space for you to get set up.  This is when you must act.  Youll start your turn with 4 or more force (2 from Obis Hut, 1 from Rendili and 1 for yourself).  We have no way to pull out sites or provide our own activation, and we cant survive on 4 force for the whole game.  Ill add a few twix sites, plus some Tatooine draining sites that should boost our activation level up to acceptable.  Yodas Hut and Rendezvous Point are the best twix sites, and the Hoth and Home One War Rooms only let my opponent drain for one so they sound good for now.  Tosche Station is the best way for us to get large activation off of one site, so two of those could be added, along with a couple drain sites such as Cantina and the Jundland Wastes.  Obi-Wan, who is our battling machine, benefits from our starting location greatly and can be moved to the Tosche Station for some extra generation.  Ben Kenobi is the best version for Tatooine, but for some versatility we should add a Premiere Jedi as well.  These Obis pack immunity in place of a built in weapon, and to compensate for this, Ill add two of his glowstick.	So in the opening stages, our deck looks like this.<br>
<br>
Tatooine: Obi-Wans Hut (Starting Location)<br>
Tatooine: Jundland Wastes<br>
Tatooine: Cantina<br>
Tatooine: Tosche Station x2<br>
Hoth: Echo Command Center<br>
Home One: War Room<br>
Dagobah: Yodas Hut<br>
Rendezvous Point<br>
Ben Kenobi x3<br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi<br>
Obi-Wans Lightsaber x2<br>
Sense x5<br>
Alter x4<br>
The Signal (Starting Interrupt)<br>
Goo Nee Tay (Starting Effect)<br>
<br>
	What weve got here takes care of force generation, speed (both personal and reducing the opponents), and disrupting the opponent (Goo Nee Tay, Sense/Alter).  Now we need a few starships, because we dont want to give away any easy drains.  Im thinking of Liberty, Tantive IV and Spiral (Because they can add pilots if need be and their special abilities) and one of each Falcon (Millennium Falcon and Lando In Millennium Falcon).  This could be enough to hold up in space, as we can assume that Rendili will be out.  If we have some extra space, another ship could go in but it doesnt look like it will be needed.  Since we have the space portion of the deck basically taken care of, its time for the characters.<br>
<br>
	We already have 4 Obis in, now we need a support crew.	Luke is a must, but since hes going to be being escorted by Vader, we dont need more than 2.  You might be saying that we need only one but if we dont play BHBM, then 2 EPP Lukes will come in handy.	Two copies of the other big three (Han, Leia and Chewie) sound good, along with one of each of the little three (Orrimarrko, Melas and Tawss Khaa) and the forgotten but very important three (Harc Seff, Romas Lock Navander and Wedge).  You might be wondering about these three but let me explain.  Harc Seff (as T.J Holman summed it up best) is a walking It Could Be Worse.  Hes also a pilot, destiny 3, and immune to the +2 on Ralltiir.  Romas Lock Navander is a pilot, stops reacts which is also huge against Rops and he benefits from Insurrection.  Wedge is destiny 4, deploy 2, forfeit 6 (8 with Insurrection) and a pilot that adds three to power.  Its sometimes nice to have access to those unfriendly twix sites so Ill also add a Jereon Webb.  Now our list is getting longer.<br>
<br>
Tatooine: Obi-Wans Hut (Starting Location)<br>
Tatooine: Jundland Wastes<br>
Tatooine: Cantina<br>

<br>
	Weve got everything now except for the red cards.  These cards are highly underrated as they can make or break a deck.	The first one I think of is Insurrection because we have five characters which benefit from it and too many decks, especially BHBM, are starting IAO these days.  Another Effect to add is Wise Advice, in case we lose any Sense/Alter wars.  A couple Grabbers go good in any deck, and with Wise Advice out, they play for free.  Honor Of The Jedi is a must, as it knocks down the duel damage to 1 and Your Destiny damage to 1 as well.	Bacta Tank is good too because we dont have any retrieval as of yet and we should have enough generation going to keep it up and running.  Traffic Control is nice, as is Order To Engage and Legendary Starfighter.  Traffic to keep your hand low, Order to stop them from running away and Legendary for some much needed force loss.  Ive got one more Effect left and thats Battle Plan.  We generate enough and what better to slow drains down with than this.  The interrupts get a little tougher, and weve already got 9 (5 Sense/4 Alter) so we have to keep it down.  Ill want to get my hands on Vaders and Maras Sabers so Ill add in two copies of Weapon Levitiation.  Oh look, its destiny four, cancels You Are Beaten and I can fetch my Obis Saber from my used pile.  Its like the anti-BHBM card.  Glancing Blow is great against Vader, theyll almost have to lose him.	With Vader power zero, it gets harder to win battles.  I think I might even add two in.  Ive got two Sabers in and when one of their characters is Clashed, especially Vader, it makes it that much tougher to win battles.  By far the best card to beat this deck so far is Out Of Commission, place a random card from their Lost Pile out of play.	If you can get Vader, or even Mara things will be very good.  Lets see how this deck list is shaping up:<br>
<br>
Tatooine: Obi-Wans Hut (Starting Location)<br>
Tatooine: Jundland Wastes<br>
Tatooine: Cantina<br>
Tatooine: Tosche Station x2<br>

	Now for my least favorite part of deckbuilding, counting.  Its not because its hard but I hate doing it because it makes me realize how far over sixty cards I am and that I have to take out lots of things.  65, not too bad because we can pull a few things.  I dont need two grabbers, and I dont need two Chewbaccas either so Ill pull one of each of those.  Four copies of Out Of Commission is kind of pushing it, so Ill cut it down to three, and we now have 2 cards to get rid of.  Romas Lock is good, but weve got senses to cancel reacts so we can do without him.  I hate to do this but I think Ill cut down on an Alter, only because we need space and three should be sufficient.  So now we have it, the anti-BHBM deck, but can it win against anything else?	Well figure that out later because our main goal is how to beat BHBM.  Heres the decklist:<br>

The Signal (Starting Interrupt)<br>
<br>
	The point of this article was to beat BHBM, now weve got half of it done, the deck.  We have to get the deck strategy working before this article is complete.	Also, if it just beats BHBM, then will it be rendered useless against any other decktype?<br>
<br>
	Against BHBM: Start Obis Hut and Goo Nee Tay.  Try to get Obi out early so you can get Sense/Alter working.  Being able to make sure all of your interrupts go through and none of theirs do is key in this game, as it establishes you control of the board.  When they deploy Vader, give them Luke from Reserve Deck or Lost Pile and make them win three battles.  Three battles might not seem hard to win but think of how many battles you won last game, two or three maybe.  Every turn theyre losing one force, dont forget this because even though its their card, you have to enforce it.	If you can get Legendary Starfighter on the Falcon, that will seal the game right there.  Pick your battles smartly, because you cant afford to lose too many.	If OOC makes it on Vader, theyll be hurting.  If Vader is sitting alone at a site, you can drop Tawss Khaa, Orri or Melas, battle, Weapon Lev., Glancing Blow, slice and there goes Vader.  Youve got all the tools to win, just play the deck smart.<br>
<br>
	Against Hunt Down: I doubt youll see this anymore, but in case you do, proceed as you would against BHBM but get out Honor or get Jereon to cancel Visage.  You have enough Sense/Alter to protect you from dying in duels.  OOC is big against Vader, so is Glancing Blow.<br>
<br>
	Against Ralltiir Operations: Leave Ben to drain on Tatooine, and send everything else their way.  Goo Nee Tay will slow them down a bit, at least enough for you to get Obi down and start SACing.  Alter Overseeing It Personally and Bad Feeling Have I, stay away from the Desert and maintain control over the system.  Battle Plan, Order To Engage and Harc Seff will be huge in this game and so will Sensing their reacts.  This could get a little hard, but its definitely winnable.<br>
<br>
	Against TDIGWATT: Everything goes at Cloud City, except Ben, who you use to activate, drain and Sense/Alter.  If you dont go to Cloud City, you will lose.  A couple turns of Dark Deal drains will kill you.  You should be able to maintain a foothold on the system to keep them from flipping.  Goo Nee Tay should slow them down enough to help you get set up.  Harc Seff will earn his keep in this game, dont let him die.<br>
<br>
	Against Endor Operations: Ive never played a flipping version of this deck, so Ill just stick with the non-flip type.  Ben, again, stays on Tatooine to drain and SAC.	Hold your Alters for Lateral Damage and throw everything into space.  Hopefully you can get out Legendary Starfighter and just keep pecking away at them.  The new Admirals Order Were In Attack Position Now really makes this deck a force to be reckoned with.  With EPP Han and Leia adding destinies, you should be able to crack their immunity.	Another tough game and itll come down to the player.<br>
<br>
	Against Operatives: Heh.if you ever see this again start Battle Plan instead of Goo Nee Tay.  Theyll never be able to keep up with your Sense/Alter and battling mains.  Easy win.<br>
<br>
	Against TIEs: This game should be very hard if you dont get Ben down early.  Their cannons will probably shoot down the Falcon so plan on using your Capital ships.  Sense their All Power To Weapons, and Alter Lateral Damage and SFS if you get the chance.	Be weary because this deck packs a lot of power and can beat you down when you least expect it.<br>
<br>
	Ok, I think this is long enough for my first article on DeckTech and I think Ive gotten my point across.  Bring Him Before Me/Take Your Fathers Place is beatable, beyond a shadow of a doubt, with the right kind of preparation.  I hope this will help you in further games against this deck, D-Mail me if it does.  Thanks for reading.<br>
