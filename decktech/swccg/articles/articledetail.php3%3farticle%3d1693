Some people put too much defense in thier decks, and they end up having no offense to win the game with. Others don't pack any, and find themselves screwed against a certain deck type.<br>
<br>
This article describes a plethora of defensive cards that are all tournament-worthy. But don't think that this means that you should put all of these cards in your deck (there are too many, anyways). Be aware of the ones that cover the weaknesses of your deck type and those that are useless in your deck.<br>
<br>
This is a great article for newbies, who probably haven't heard of many of these cards. As for veterans, don't give up on this article too quickly. You might actually find a card that you didn't know about or didn't think was very good. It took me two days to compile this list, so I didn't miss anything. Here we go. . .<br>
<br>
GENERAL<br>
<br>
Sense (LS + DS, Premiere)/Alter (LS + DS, Premiere)<br>
<br>
No matter what you say, these are the best defensive cards in the game. Sense keeps away the opponent's Sense/Alter, and Alter gets rid of annoying effects like Scramble and Lateral Damage. Every deck can use a few. And don't think that Oppressive Enforcement/Wise Advice kills these cards. Sure, the card goes back into their deck, but it's still canceled, which is all that really matters.<br>
<br>
Honor Of The Jedi (LS, DSII)<br>
<br>
This card belongs in almost EVERY LS deck. It's so good that it almost NEEDS to be errataed. It cuts losses from Your Destiny, Take Your Father's Place (losing a duel to Vader), COTVG, Carbon-Freezing, There Is No Try, We're In Attack Position Now, opponent's drains at your 2-0 sites, and the list goes on and on. Just make sure you occupy a BG before you play this or it'll get Altered.<br>
<br>
What&amp;#8217;re You Tryin&amp;#8217; To Push On Us? (LS, ANH)/There&amp;#8217;ll Be Hell To Pay (DS, ANH)<br>
<br>
The grabbers. Again, every deck should have at least one copy. In DS decks, you can grab annoying retrieval cards like On/Off the Edge and Harvest or annoying cards like Out of Commission. For the LS, Barriers and Tramples are top targets; you might grab Force Lightning or Monnok if they're annoying you too much, though. These are amazingly versatile cards.<br>
<br>
Ultimatum (LS, JP)/Resistance (DS, JP)<br>
<br>
Resistance is the one of the most underused cards for the Dark Side. Most MWYHLs pack Anger, Fear, Aggressions and the DS doesn't have Honor of the Jedi. Solution? Resistance. OK, so you still lose 2 Force, but the savings add up. Plus, it gives insurance against numbers, which haven't lost too much popularity (most people sac the magic bullet anyways). Ultimatum isn't as useful because the DS doesn't have any inserts that cause damage (except odds, for which you can use Your Insight Serves You Well).<br>
<br>
Menace Fades (LS, DSII)/Imperial Decree (DS, CC)<br>
<br>
Another pair of underused cards. Canceling force drain bonuses is HUGE, and often lets you ignore the opponent's drains. Menace Fades shuts down RalOps, negating Overseeing It Personally, Spaceport City (often used with Expand the Empire), and any other bonuses. Imperial Decree, while harder to satisfy, is killer against EBO and is great against a variety of LS decks. It belongs in most DS decks. NOTE: Don't let anyone fool you: These cards are not considered to modify the opponent's drains. Therefore, Strikeforce and Independent Operation/Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further/Imperial Outpost won't stop ehse cards.<br>
<br>
Yarna D'al' Gargan (LS, JP)/Well Guarded (DS, JP)<br>
<br>
A must in any deck with lots of multiples. Elom beatdown decks will definitely need this, as will TIE swarm decks. These decks should have several copies of The Signal/Twi'lek Advisor to get out the appropriate effect ASAP, because Monnok can seriously hurt.<br>
<br>
Twilight Is Upon Me (LS, DSII)/Crush The Rebellion (DS, ECC)<br>
<br>
These are anti-beatdown cards. CTR stops Clash of Sabers, and Twilight stops its DS counterpart as well as Dark Jedi Presence. Crush the Rebellion can also fetch Evader to cancel Revolution or I Have You Now to add destinies with Vader. Twilight is a bit worse since you must have 2 Force active to cancel You Are Beaten (as opposed to CTR, which requires losing 1 Force), but it can also get The Force Is Strong With This One (a Luke destiny adder) and Anakin Skywalker (see separate entry below).<br>
<br>
Scrambled Transmission (LS, SE)/Secret Plans (DS, SE)/Aim High (LS, Endor)<br>
<br>
Scrambled Transmission is purely anti-Manip. Shocking Information can't be canceled now (only grabbed) so M'iiyoom will have to be lost. If your opponent doesn't play Manip, then you can use it to check what's in your deck as well as to fetch a recyclable 5 that you can track. Secret Plans isn't as useful since LS Manip isn't too common, but it has an added bonus: you can slow down the opponent's retrieval. Against MWYHL, you can make them pay a high price, and against Profit you might even make them skip the retrieval. And, like Scrambled Transmission, you can use it to check your deck and recycle a 5.<br>
Aim High is the LS equivalent of this part of Secret Plans. Though you probably won't be able to use the power +5 part of the card, Aim High can be instrumental in bringing down a TIE deck since it greatly slows their retrieval. These cards are strong choices for any deck.<br>
<br>
Goo Nee Tay (LS, SE)/Bad Feeling Have I (DS, Dagobah)<br>
<br>
Goo Nee Tay is more anti-Manip. If you can bring it out and protect it from Alter (fairly easy in MWYHL decks), a Manip deck will catastrophically fail. Against all other decks, Goo Nee Tay can make the opponent pay a lot for their higher-ability characters. Bad Feeling Have I does the same, and is particularly useful against Profit decks, which are full of mains (doesn't work on Massa, though). It's also useful against MWYHL decks, which bring out Yoda and Luke/Leia early. I do realize that only Goo Nee Tay is really defensive, but making the opponent pay more can be quite advantageous to you.<br>
<br>
I Hope She's All Right (LS, Endor)/Search And Destroy (DS, Endor)<br>
<br>
Great against decks that avoid the ground. IHSAR isn't as good as the DS version, but you can use it against Big Blue decks to make the opponent come to the ground. Search And Destroy is a wonder against MWYHL and EBO, but Honor of the Jedi nullifies the loss, so make sure to occupy three BGs first. Also comes in useful against Elom decks which occasionally have trouble finding a low destiny character! Unfortunately, both of these effects are prone to Alter, so you'll have to protect them.<br>
<br>
Battle Plan (LS, Endor)/Battle Order (DS, Endor)<br>
<br>
Make the opponent pay to drain unless they occupy both ground and space BGs. Great against space decks, and can also be used to slow down the opponent early on. IMPORTANT: This card is a double-edged sword. It can come back to haunt you if you aren't careful. Only use in MWYHL (if you're not draining) or if you know you can hold both ground and space.<br>
<br>
Come Here You Big Coward! (DS, SE)<br>
<br>
For decks that like to avoid fighting while retrieving and draining. Useful against MWYHL (even though it doesn't allow retrieval or training on Dagobah) and Profit since it forces the opponent to occupy two BGs in order to retrieve Force when they flip. Also good against EBO. Depending on your deck type, you might want this in your deck.<br>
<br>
Something Special Planned For Them (DS, DSII)<br>
<br>
Anti-retrieval. On The Edge, Off The Edge, Death Star Plans, Harvest, Wind Chimes, All Wings Report In, they ALL go out of play. Breaks annoying loops of retrieval. Often, you're probably better off using a grabber, which basically does the same thing (though it can only target one interrupt and can't target Death Star Plans). Still, you might want to use this if you really fear retrieval. BTW, this card can also stop Hyper Escape by increasing the cost of moving away.<br>
<br>
ANTI-OBJECTIVE<br>
<br>
Security Precautions (DS, SE)<br>
<br>
Self-explanatory. This card basically ruins Hidden Base. Against all other decks, though, all it does is let you generate one extra Force. Still, it's usually worth the deck slot, especially if Hidden Base is popular in your area.<br>
<br>
Broken Concentration (DS, SE)<br>
<br>
A central card in Manip decks, this card is also anti-MWYHL. Unfortunately, most MWYHL decks nowadays can get through this with relative ease. Also, you'll notice that it's not immune to Alter, which hurts a lot (even though Altering is harder). Probably not worth a deck slot anymore.<br>
<br>
Colonel Salm (LS, DSII)/Captain Sarkli (DS, DSII)<br>
<br>
If Ops was already dead before DSII came out, these cards hammered the nail into the coffin. Against Ops decks, simply stick your guy onto the Home One/Executor (or any other ship) at the Ops system and the opponent will never see the flip side of his/her objective. Plus, these guys have other uses. Salm can be placed at the Home One: War Room and Sarkli is a spy who can render twix sites useless.<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker (LS, DSII)/I Feel The Conflict (LS, DSII)/NOOOOOOOOOOOO! (LS, CC)<br>
<br>
Anakin Skywalker/I Feel The Conflict is an interesting combo that can be used in any deck. Against a BHBM deck, play IFTC and try to stack three or four. Then, when the opponent is about to cross Vader, play Anakin Skywalker and turn the tables on your opponent! This combo is especially effective in a MWYHL deck if you can rig a 7 for destiny. You only have to win one battle/duel (automatic if you're training Leia and going up to test 6) and the opponent can't cancel Anakin Skywalker once you flip.<br>
Or you could be lazy and simply play NOOOOOOOOOOOO! to send Luke to the Lost Pile instead of the Dark Side. WARNING: Both Anakin Skywalker and NOOOOOOOOOOOO! are vulnerable to Sense. In addition, the latter (I'm getting tired of writing that) can be canceled by Young Fool, which most BHBM decks use.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Blount (LS, DSII)<br>
<br>
Anti-ISB Ops. Take a Coruscant location with him and the ISB becomes what the KGB is today (hehe). Plus, he's a spy. Easily worth the deck slot, especially if you play Insurrection.<br>
<br>
Let's Keep A Little Optimism Here (LS, DSII)/Leave Them To Me (DS, DSII)<br>
<br>
These cards make the flip side of Ops practically useless, but they're not as versatile as Salm/Sarkli. At the very best, you could deploy it and then lose it at a certain time to retrieve a specific card. Not worth the slot unless your area is crazy about Ops (your town must be stuck in Special Edition).<br>
<br>
Failure At The Cave (DS, Dagobah)/He Is Not Ready (DS, Dagobah)<br>
<br>
More anti-MWYHL, both of which are again vulnerable to Alter. Failure is hard to set up because it requires the Dagobah: Cave, but it can hurt a MWYHL with low destiny. He Is Not Ready, on the other hand, is a pretty versatile card that can either hamper training or be placed on the opponent's pilot to make him move, lose the character, or lose 1 Force (pointless if Honor of the Jedi is out). These cards are only particularly useful in conjunction with Broken Concentration, in which case you could really slow down MWYHL.<br>
<br>
Commence Recharging (LS, ANH)/They're On Dantooine (LS, ANH)<br>
<br>
Anti-SYCFA, but useless against everything else. Only useful against your friends, and even then they're not immune to Alter. In no way worth a deck slot (I don't why I even mentioned these :-P).<br>
<br>
MISCELLANEOUS<br>
<br>
Do Or Do Not (LS, Dagobah)/There Is No Try (DS, Dagobah)<br>
<br>
If you're not packing any Sense/Alter, then you'll want to use this. Wise Advice/Oppressive Enforcement just isn't enough if you have lots of Sensable and Alterable cards. NOTE: For the DS, There Is No Try doesn't do much if Honor of the Jedi is out, so you'll have to occupy 3 BGs to really discourage the LS.<br>
<br>
Projection of a Skywalker (LS, JP)/Dark Waters (DS, ANH)<br>
<br>
Slow down the opponent's drains at sites that you can't get to or don't want to get to. PoaS is great in MWYHL and Profit; besides, it's a destiny 5 card. Dark Waters is nice in Big Blue decks, though its destiny kinda sucks. Like almost everything else in this article, these are Alterable, so make sure you can protect these.<br>
<br>
The Bith Shuffle (LS, Premiere)/Ommni Box (DS, Premiere)<br>
<br>
Two INCREDIBLY useful cards that are worthy of being in many decks. First off, they're recyclable 5s. And Ommni Box can seriously hurt a MWYHL deck. Just play it when they're about to draw destiny for test #5 and you can SERIOUSLY disrupt their plans. It's also great against EBO Baragwins. The Bith Shuffle isn't as useful, but it's good for disrupting cycles like the Brangus Glee/Put All Sections On Alert one (after they play Put All Sections On Alert, shuffle the Lost Pile and Brangus can't get it back).<br>
<br>
It Can Wait (LS, Hoth)/I'd Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee (DS, Hoth)<br>
<br>
Two amazing cards. More useful than Barriers in most situations. For example, let's say you have ZiMH at a system and the opponent slaps down the Megafalcon on you. Play IJASKAW on Leia (Han would be better but you'll want to play this on the last character deployed) and on your turn, use DiPO or something to get rid of the now-useless Falcon and end the threat. It Can Wait is equally useful and can stop Mara or another pesky character. The only drawback is that you need to save Force, but then again, Barriers requires Force too.<br>
<br>
Captain Godhert (DS, DSII)/Those Rebels Won't Escape Us (DS, Dagobah)/Homing Beacon (DS, SE)<br>
<br>
Landing Claw tech. Captain Godhert isn't as good as the others because he has to be on a SD to cancel Landing Claw. TRWEU is probably the best because it can also cancel Nabrun, Hyper Escape, or a react. Homing Beacon requires a bounty hunter or an Imperial leader to be on the table, but it has higher destiny than the others and allows your ships to move to the same location for free (yay!).<br>
<br>
Worrt (LS, JP)/Bubo (DS, JP)<br>
<br>
Undercover tech. Bubo is more useful since quite a few LS decks use Undercover spies (unfortunately, he can't chomp Boussh unless she gets a 0 for destiny). Bubo can also chomp annoying guys like Harc Seff and Tessek. DS Undercover spies are rare, but Worrt shines in Profits, where he can prevent the opponent from using landspeed.<br>
<br>
Point Man (DS, SE)/Boring Conversation Anyway (DS, Premiere)<br>
<br>
A pair of interrupts that cancel a variety of cards. Point Man is particularly useful since it cancels Order To Engage, which most LS decks use. Demotion and Scramble are also annoying cards that are handled by Point Man. Boring Conversation Anyway keeps away Skywalkers and Don't Get Cocky, two destiny adders. It also cancels Gift of the Mentor and Surprise Assault. NOTE: These cards are superior to Sense/Alter because Wise Advice will simply recycle the canceled cards, while these send their targets straight to the Lost Pile. Still, they probably won't be too useful in most decks.<br>
<br>
Blast Door Controls (DS, Premiere)<br>
<br>
Not very versatile. The only useful cards it cancels are Rebel Barrier and Narrow Escape, but at least it stays on the table (then again, it's not immune to Alter). Only use this if Rebel Barriers are very common in your area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whew! That's the end of the list. Now, find out which of these cards would be useful in your deck. Some, like Resistance and Menace Fades, work in any deck, while others are more deck-specific (for example, Bring Him Before Me tends to be a bit weak against MWYHL, so packing Resistance and Ommni Box would be a good idea). And someone with a Profit deck might add in Scrambled Transmission to keep away Manip decks.<br>
