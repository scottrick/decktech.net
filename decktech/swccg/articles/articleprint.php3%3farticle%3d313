Welcome to THE GAME, people. Force management is perhaps the most fundamental element of the game and, strangely, one of the least discussed. This may be because it is so basic that everyone intuitively understands it. But my experience tells me otherwise. So often I encounter players who have good deck ideas and combos but who lose because they do not devote enough planning and deck space to the force generation race. The concept is simple enough but the execution can be tricky: You need enough force to realize the objectives of your deck while stopping your opponent from accomplishing his objectives. This requirement transcends all deck types and strategies. All deck types require force generation to work. Some require more -- some require less.<br>
<br>
The basic issues are dealt with in deck construction. Three basic questions to ask yourself when building a deck are:<br>
1. Do I have enough force to deploy my Characters, vehicles, creatures, starships and effects and some to spare for interrupts, bluffs and other activities that cost force?<br>
2. Do I help my opponent by giving away force?<br>
3. Am I vulnerable to a force choke strategy?<br>
<br>
Look at the characters, vehicles, starships and effects that you plan to deploy and think about when you are likely to want to deploy them and in what groupings. By this I mean that, if you are hoping to achieve a one turn surprise beatdown, you will need to generate a lot of force in one turn to deploy your hit squad all at once; or you will have to steal force (with Beggar, for instance) from your opponent.  Deploying the characters piecemeal over several turns will water down the 'hit squad' effect by giving your opponent advance knowledge and time to prepare.<br>
<br>
Then look at your locations to determine at what point in the game you think you will have enough force generation to deploy the combos you want. You have to decide whether you can afford to save up force for a big deploy or if you need to do it all in one turn. Even if you are not saving up for a big deploy, it is almost always good to leave several force in your force pile to support your interrupts and reacts and to bluff your opponent into thinking you might have interrupts and reacts that they might fear. Remember, for instance, if It Could Be Worse or Harc Seff are important to your light side strategy, they cost force. You must plan for this. While it is reasonable to suppose that your opponent will give you some force icons, it is best not to count on it.<br>
<br>
Now the flip side: When you are choosing your locations, you need to determine how many force icons to give your opponent. My usual rule of thumb is to try to give myself more than twice as many force icons as I give my opponent. Usually the fewer I give away, the better I like it. This is not to say that you should never take locations that give as much force as they get. It is very important, however, to have good reasons for doing it and to plan for it carefully. If you need the game text, or a battle ground, or if you need the location to use the gametext of a card in your deck (e.g., Cantina for Mos Eisley Shuffle, Generic Sites for Ops), then go ahead and take a 1/1 or 2/2 location or 2.<br>
<br>
Of course, locations are just the basic tools of force generation. There are many other cards that enhance or inhibit force generation. Some interrupts simply allow you to activate force (usually for a price). Popular ones include: Imperial Supply, Spaceport Speeders, Beru Stew, Careful Planning, etc.	There are effects that impact force generation directly including: Presence of the Force, Security Precautions, Imperial Domination, Revolution, Luke's Cape, etc. Some effects impact force generation indirectly: Beggar, Broken Concentration and Frozen Assets are examples. There are several characters that impact force generation: Yoda, Daughter if Skywalker, Premier Luke, Ithorians, B'omar Monks, Jabba The Hutt. And, of course, Nudjs and Sleens are creatures that have an impact on force generation as well. The above lists are not intended to be exhaustive. There are many other examples.<br>
<br>
Getting the jump<br>
<br>
One of the important things for a newbie to grasp is the snowball effect that is initiated by early activation (or lack thereof). In other words, if you begin the game activating only 3 force, it will take you longer to  get the force generation tools you need than it will if you begin the game activating 5 force. Take 2 comparable light side decks. Each has 10 locations with 16 total light side force icons. One starts Obi's Hut. The other starts Obi's Hutt/Careful Planning/The Farm/Spaceport City. The Careful Planning start has 5 light side icons to begin with, in addition to 7 more locations (with 11 total Icons for the light side) The straight Obi's Hut start gives you 2 force icons and leaves 9 additional locations (with 14 total Icons for your side) in your reserve deck. With the Careful Planning start you not only get to activate at least 6 force on turn 1 but your chances of finding another location in that first activation are much higher than they would be in the straight Obi's Hut start with its activation of 3 force. You have also reduced the chances of drawing a zero for destiny early in the game. The impact is huge. So huge, in fact that you might be able to afford to drop a location or 2 from your deck and add some other stuff. Raising your average destiny even higher.<br>
<br>
You will notice that virtually all of the popular deck types include some way to jump start your force activation -- either by starting you right off with a good force advantage (like Hunt Down) or by allowing you to get locations out of your reserve deck (like Ops). With every expansion it seems that the first cards that gain popularity are the ones that give early force advantage. Jabba's Palace/Expand the Empire, Obi's Hutt/Careful Planning/Toschi Station, Throne Room/Careful Planning/Swamp/Farm/Nudj, Various Objectives, Death Star are all examples of this.<br>
<br>
The power of other strong deck types rests in siezing the force advantage as well. Maelstrom used Spaceport Speeders to create a massive force advantage. Brentson's Beats uses Beggar to create a force advantage  by stealing the opponent's saved force. And, of course, there's the mother of all strategies...<br>
<br>
The Choke<br>
<br>
This deck type in all its forms demonstrates the importance of adequate force generation by taking it away from the opponent. And, if it works, it wins. Period. Whenever a choke deck hits the tournament scene, the counters for it become required components of every opposing deck. It's based on a simple, but profound, military principle: if you can cut off the opposition's line of supply, they will lose. This is not a heroic strategy, no epic battles or exciting chases. This is the SWCCG equivalent of seige warfare. You just sit there and watch your opponent starve to death.<br>
<br>
Force choke is accomplished in 2 ways:<br>
<br>
1. Inhibit your opponent's force generation by:<br>
Giving him/her no force Icons from your locations (two for me, none for you) and Taking away his/her own force Icons (Revolution, nudj, sleen, Imperial Domination, etc.) Revolution is doubly powerful because it takes force Icons from your opponent and gives them to you.<br>
<br>
2. Increase the deployment cost of his/her cards:<br>
Bad Feeling Have I, Goo Nee Tay, Hnemthe (or whatever), Wrong Turn, Raltiir Operations, etc are a few examples of cards that do this.<br>
<br>
Being the victim of a successful force choke is one of the most frustrating ways to lose a game. Although people are very vocal in their opposition to inserts, asteroids, and operatives, I have seen more players lose their composure when being force choked than when losing to any other strategy.<br>
<br>
My best suggestion is to always build your decks with the assumption that you will face a force choke deck. Be responsible for activating and preserving your own force. This gives you a better chance of getting to play your own strategy. I will not go into specific counters here but I will reiterate the basic governing principle of this article. Plan to generate adequate force to at least maintain parity and at best sieze the advantage. When you are reviewing a deck, count up the force icons for both sides and look at the force requirements of the other cards in the deck. If you can't see how the activation supports the rest of the cards, you are probably looking at a deck with a serious flaw.<br>
<br>
Understand how you are going to manage your force during the game and try  to stick to the plan. You have to be flexible but don't panic. Once you have cards deployed, always try to leave cards in your force pile. My eyes light up when my opponents force pile is empty because the number of things I have to worry about is greatly diminished (no Elis Helrot, no Surprise Assault, no Quite A Mercenary, etc.) Remember that force advantage is not simply a matter of generating more force than your opponent. It is a matter of having enough force to carry out your game plan...<br>

The better supplied army usually wins.<br>
