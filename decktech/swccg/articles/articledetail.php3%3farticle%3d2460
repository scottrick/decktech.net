This article presumes that you know how podracing works, even if it is a new mechanic. To simplify, you draw destiny every dark control phase and stack it, and when the pile is over 24, the winner retrieves 6 and the loser loses 6. <br>
<br>
<br>
I. To podrace or not to podrace?<br>
Like all strategies, podracing is more effective the more cards you devote to it. <br>
First, it is important to see what your deck will give up if you podrace. I do not believe podracing is strong enough to be its own decktype; more of a side strategy to existing types (even if the side strat is just mains and toys). Both the starting interrupts give you the power of Twi&#146;lek in starting an effect; you could do a Scum podracing and actually start Scum again, or Podracing/TIEs. You only get one effect though, so decks that need more than one effect to get going shouldn&#146;t podrace; Rebel Strike Team (with Strike Planning and the new card) comes to mind.<br>
You need a podracer (duh). You have to use Anakin&#146;s racer for light. Dark has a few options, but I won&#146;t muck around with them; Sebulba&#146;s is the best, with denying your opponent an early draw and adding three to each of your draws. Your starting interrupt also gives you an extra site; one more activation for both players early on.<br>
If you start the podrace on turn one, it will often be finished as most decks have just finished setting up. Now, retreiving six and making your opponent lose six at this point is all well and good, but its scarcely worth sacrificing your starting setup. If you are going to bother starting the podrace, you need the cards that make winning it MATTER. The darkside has Watto&#146;s Box, which adds five to the force you retrieve and the force your opponent loses. Winning the epic duel doesn&#146;t cause so much force loss. To really get it to work, though, you need to sacrifice your starting effect for it. This cuts out serious podracing for decks that need an effect on the table (read: the decks that got enhancer in Tat). You could try it; after all, their are EBO decks that don&#146;t start ANSB. Winning the podrace for the DS in effect is little more than a huge one-time force swing; but if your opponent has total board control you&#146;ll still lose the game. The LS is a little more interesting. You can use I did it! to retrieve 4 force, retrieve a force per turn (and put it on the force pile), and make your opponent lose two force or place their force pile in their used pile. To do those last two, though, you need to fulfill the battleground site/system condition. Because of that, I don&#146;t think its as powerful, but its damned annoying. It could be awesome coupled with LS force choke to deny the opponent saving force. Note the Epic Event doesn&#146;t call the one force/turn retrieval &quot;retrieval&quot;, so you don&#146;t have to pay Secret Plans. And getting more retrieval is always good. And Anakin&#146;s Podracer can pull it, so its easier to splice in because you don&#146;t have to sacrifice your lone starting effect.<br>
Now that we&#146;ve seen what podracing can do, the question must be raised: should you podrace? My answer is that if you have the card space AND you can afford the modification to your starting setup (easier for LS), yes. It is a far, far more risky strategy for the DS, however; with the Box out, that 22-force swing could potentially be going the wrong direction. I Did It! is cool, but its hard to imagine it making a deck. The best deck canidates (IMO) are the infinitely adaptable Hunt Down for dark, and WYS for light. Hunt Down is just easy to splice and make with high destiny; combined with dueling, your causing lots of huge force swings with not a lot of cards. WYS+I Did It+Mob Points hoser=mondo force choke. Another good canidate is Black Sun, because of its awesome deck manipulation capabilities. You will have a hard time finding room in any card intensive strategy, but this for the DS, it is at least a way to retrieve without building the entire deck around it. LS decks based on Tatooine (like WYS) have an advantage in support cards, which we&#146;ll go to next.<br>
The greatest strength of podracing is that it requires you to pay little force on it, so it goes on, doing its own thing, while your committing resources to other theaters. <br>
<br>
II. Support Cards<br>
I mentioned the effect and the epic event. I touched on Podracers. On the whole I think Sebulba is better than Anakin, because you get a good head start and you are less at the whim of destiny draws--since the podrace begins right away, you can&#146;t track to insure good destiny and Decipher seems to be hosing tracking in this expansion anyway. <br>
You want to win the race if you&#146;re bothering to podrace, especially if you are DS. Many cards damage your opponent&#146;s racer, which requires them to lose a force to stack destiny. This might make your opponent think twice about stacking a bad destiny, if you win adds to the swing, and if you lose it won&#146;t matter so much. In general, damaging cards are better for the DS, because Anakin&#146;s podracer stacks two destinies (as opposed to destiny+bonus). <br>
There are, after a quick skim, three interupts per side which affect podracing (this was just a cursory look through the box). For both sides, you want to rely mainly on cards which are useful if your opponent has no podracer (if you have a racer and he doesn&#146;t, you almost auto-win). First the DS interrupts. Pit Crews can repiar your Podracer, damage a Podracer, or look through your opponent&#146;s hand and nail any cards they have three or more of. It can be Shocked, though, and the odds of getting someone with 3+ of a card in hand are slim, but still you get to look at your hand. Its the most flexible podracing support card, because you have a nonrace function, can repair, and damage. Its also destiny 4. Podracer Collision is destiny 5, and it lets you lose 1 force to remove a race destiny and place it in opponent&#146;s hand. The selection is random, though. Still, if your opponent has stacked all good destinies, it can be worth it, and losing 1 force to save the 22 force swing is a fair trade. It has a useful used function; if you just verified their Reserve Deck, you can place an interrupt there out of play. This keeps them from abusing search cards to just keep at their destinies, and you can nail the occassional unlucky player who activated his key card, as well. Hit Podracer (destiny 4) probably has the best race function, but it has no nonrace function. You target a podracer with a race total with 4 of yours, and if you draw destiny greater than its destiny number (ie 4) your opponent can&#146;t draw destiny this turn and his podracer is damaged. Worth a spot in a dedicated podracing deck because it does two bad things to your opponent, and another turn of drawing can make a big difference. The DS also has the pit droid, which is the easiest way to repair. It lets you lose a force to redraw a race destiny, a neat trick, but it needs to be at the podrace bay--which only the LS player can pllay.<br>
The LS also has three interrupts. Neck and neck is smiliar to Hit Racer in that it knocks out their race destiny if they are close to you, but it requires no draw and it doesn&#146;t damage the podracer. It also lets you and your opponent retreive 4 force if you both have less than 10; you can get back the force to pay for Battle Order, or to put down the lone power character to beat down the guy they overconfidentally spread. A Step Backward puts the last race destiny ˆn the used pile for both players. The obvious advantage of this is if you drew bad and your opponent drew good; more importantly, it slows the podrace down if you don&#146;t want it to finish yet. You can also discard three cards at random to retrieve a character to your hand, a more than fair trade at times. Its destiny 5. Losing Track is destiny 6, and its race related functions are the same as the pit crew. Used, it lets you put the top card of your opponents lost pile on their reserve deck, a very useful funciton in some situations and worse than useless in others. As an easy to track 6 thats not hurt by any of the anti-verification cards, though, it might have a place in any deck. The Podracer Bay lets you exchange your top race destiny with the top card of your lost pile if you control. This will probably be useul, but you need to commit resources to control it. The point of podracing is to do a lot of damage without a lot of interaction. If your opponent takes it over, he gets the advantages of it. Probably worth it in decks that run a lot on Tat, like WYS and Profit.<br>
<br>
III. Surviving Podracing<br>
You need a podracer. If you do not have a podracer, your opponent will win. More importantly, it makes your opponent TRY to win. He can&#146;t just kick back on the edge of the finish line and wait for an inconvenient time for the force swing. He has to use his support cards to make sure he wins.  You could also pack the support cards with have ancillary racing functions; Podracer Collission is probably the best DS for this, a Step Backward for LS probably is. <br>
Secret Plans/Aim High is a good counter. Aim High is better because the DS will likely go for a large swing. If you have a podracer yourself, your opponent may cross the finish line before he can pay for the full retrieval and effectively cut the huge swing in half. Honor can take a bit off the sting out of the force loss. Against a deck that wants to podrace, you won&#146;t win any more than you&#146;ll beat a dedicated space deck in space if you&#146;re not a space deck; but you can make life difficult for them. If podracing is not your a significant component of your strategy, but it is of your opponents, you will probably lose the podrace.<br>
For the LS, this isn&#146;t so bad. You lose force. LS decks tend to pack lots of retrieval nowadays, so its easy for them to make a comeback. Remember, after the DS done its podrace, the podracing has done its thing and if you can negate their win with Aim High, HOTJ, and retrieval, you&#146;ll be fine. Ironically a deck that could do this well is the one I said earlier couldn&#146;t podrace well itself: RST, but you&#146;d need to play Bunker Blow. Just blow the bunker after you lost the podrace and all but undo the podrace swing. Some of the huger drain decks can cause huge force loss every turn. Decks with huge regenerative properties and those with superior board control weather losing the podrace the best; if all my Dark Deal stuff if down, you winning the podrace means you do to me what I&#146;ll do to you every turn. I Did It! is a nuisance, and the best way the DS can deal with it is to keep them from fulfilling the site/system condition. <br>
Your biggest advantage over podracing is that you did NOT sacrifice your starting setup, so you should get your deck&#146;s main theme going first. If you&#146;re playing a reactive deck, though, your opponent may just hit you with the swing before revealing what he has at its disposal.<br>
In conclusion, I anticipate a magic bullet or &quot;referee&quot; card for Podracing in the next expansion. If Decipher is paying attention, the best way to balance things would be forcing you to pay force to podrace, some way to cancel a podracer&#146;s gametext or prolong the race. It lets you cause a huge shift in the game and can be horrendously noninteractive. You can&#146;t ignore podracing any more than you can ignore dueling in this writer&#146;s opinion; time may make me eat my words.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2460"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2460"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2460" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
