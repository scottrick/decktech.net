I enjoyed playing Star Wars and submitting many decks and articles for that game, but it seems that time has passed. However, I rejoice that with Lord of the Rings there is still a game out there for me to enjoy toiling over. This article is a run down of the many races the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth and their particular strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Dwarves, lords of Moria:<br>
<br>
Dwarves don’t seem to get as much playing time as the other races. This is due more to the virtues of the other races rather than any fault of the dwarves.  In truth the dwarves have many admirable qualities. <br>
<br>
Good points –<br>
<br>
1.	Dwarven equipment and support cards are comparatively cheap when compared with other Free Peoples races. The Dwarven Axe is a wonderful weapon with 0 twighlight cost. This is better than both the Elven Bow and the Hobbit Sword. The Armor of the Dwarves is also free while the corresponding armors of man are not. Many of the best dwarven support cards are also free and most others have low cost. This cost effectiveness makes the threat of massive enemy build ups less likely. <br>
2.	Dwarves have the most combat oriented cards. Almost all of the dwarven support cards are based around upping the power and damage potential of the dwarves and the rest revolve around making the dwarves able to take more hits. In battle a dwarf, even the Dwarf Guard is nothing to scoff at. <br>
3.	Access. Dwarves are one of the best races for getting accesses to your deck and taking away cards from your opponent. This hearty miners can literally dig through your deck until you get the cards you need. <br>
<br>
Bad points –<br>
<br>
1.	Few in number. The Dwarves do not have the shear numbers of the elves or hobbits. While the elves have more companions only by one. They also have enormous legions of allies. The Dwarves do not. Building a deck with Frodo and dwarves only is most difficult.<br>
2.	 Archery. The dwarves have no archers and without the help of Elven Cloaks, no defense against arrows. Though brave in battle, against assassin tactics dwarves never make it to the field.<br>
3.	Dwarf based decks tend to be very card intensive. Sure a Dwarf Guard with Axe and Armor is good bodyguard for Frodo, but pulling that off for more than one Dwarf gets tricky.<br>
<br>
Best Bet (In My Opinion) –<br>
<br>
Either Gimli/Gimli’s Battle Axe/Gimli’s Helmet/Dwarven Armor: Gimli is the ultimate body guard as it takes a 25 to overwhelm him and he only takes one hit. His 8 strength is good enough to win some fights and with him dealing out 3 hits of damage that is hardcore.<br>
<br>
Elves, lords of Rivendell and Lorien<br>
<br>
Elves are about the most popular and most used in decks of any of the Free Peoples races. This of course is due to the shear brilliance of some of the tactics of elven warfare. There are however both strength and weaknesses in this immortal race.<br>
<br>
Good Points –<br>
<br>
1.	A vast and powerful army. The elves like no other race have a truly mighty army. Their four (possibly seven) companions are excellent additions to any group. The elven allies are also much more than sideliner, their text actually hurts the enemy. Beyond that eleven support cards can bring allies into combat, and with guys like Elrond that rocks.<br>
2.	Archery. Elves are the first and last word in archery. They decimate foes before skirmishes even start.<br>
3.	Insight. Elf decks are the masters of manipulation. They give you almost as much control over the opponents deck as the opponent does.<br>
4.	Helping Hand. Elven cards have many things that come in handy. Boats to speed you up. Cloaks to shield you. Songs to release your burdens.<br>
<br>
Bad Points –<br>
<br>
1.	With the exception of Arwen (far from a normal elf) and Elrond, elves are not that strong in normal skirmishes. Many are as weak as hobbit and don’t have near as many strength enhancers. If the archery count of the elves is low or worse negated, expect to see dead elves soon.  <br>
2.	Elves are somewhat card intensive and often lead many to attempt to do too much with too little. Also elves can stand alone, but work best if backed up by at least one other race. This makes them even more card intensive.<br>
3.	Elves have a bit of disunity. Though they do have some cards that help them mingle well with other races, the benefits of these card aren’t as great as some of the other races. <br>
4.	Expensive. Elf decks can net rather high twilight pools and some of their best support cards have high costs.<br>
<br>
Best Bet (IMO) –<br>
<br>
Arwen/Asfaloth/Gwemegil/Elven Bow:  Powerhouse, especially against Nazgul and she is a ranger and archer to boot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Men, lords of Gondor<br>
<br>
Good Points –<br>
<br>
1.	Strong and tough. Men tough few in number are just about the strongest all-around fighters in the game. They have high strength, high hit points, and great game text.<br>
2.	Resources. Men have access to just about any equipment needed. Armor and Coats of Mail and Shields, even a Cloak. They also have the Athelas that can heal or remove nasty conditions. Not to mention their rather sweet arsenal of weapons, even a bow.<br>
3.	Team players. Men work well with other races, especially hobbits. This is good seeing as how you have to drag a hobbit along with you the entire game. Aragorn heals some hobbits. Boromir empowers any hobbit, as does dagger strike.<br>
4.	Power Rangers. Men claim two of the three ranger in the game and also boast an awesome assortment of ranger cards. Some of the ranger abilities in the game are undeniably fierce as single exertions can exhaust, wound, or even discard enemies.<br>
<br>
Bad Points –<br>
<br>
1.	Only two. Unfortunately the race of men has only two members thus far and thus they usually can’t stand on their own. However, with only the help of a elf or few hobbits they can move on.<br>
2.	The Price. Most of the men’s best cards force them to over exert and this can cause real problems. Also some of the cards of men have higher than other races in twighlight cost.<br>
<br>
Best Bet (IMO) –<br>
<br>
Aragorn KIE/Rangers Sword/Aragorns Bow/Armor/Coat of Mail: Aragorn is Frighteningly powerful warrior and a match for just about anyone.<br>
<br>
Hobbits, dwellers of the Shire<br>
<br>
Hobbits small and stout. Well like them or not, everyone has to play at least one of these little guys in their deck. Truth be told they are actually quite good and very versatile for such a naturally weak race.<br>
<br>
Good Points –<br>
<br>
1.	High endurance. Hobbits have the most hit points of any race and thus can take a lot of hurt on for you. They also have many ways to heal.<br>
2.	Stealth. Hobbits can avoid battles all the way to site 5 easily. They also cause relatively low shadow costs.<br>
3.	Stronger than they look. Hobbits have innumerous ways to up their power. One minute the enemy may be against a power 6 Frodo with Sting, the next he is a 17! Stronger than the Witch King!<br>
4.	Allies behind the scenes. Hobbit allies tweak the mechanics and play of the game more than most others and are cheap and easy to deploy. <br>
5.	Friendly. Hobbits can serve as backup for most any other race easily.<br>
<br>
Bad Points –<br>
<br>
1.	Weak. Hobbits need help to fight or most the time they will be overwhelmed.<br>
2.	Targets. More bad guy cards target hobbits then any other race in the game.<br>
3.	Card intensive. Hobbit decks need many support cards to play effectively.<br>
4.	Not loners. Playing a hobbit only deck is darn near impossible.<br>
5.	Archery. Like dwarves, hobbits have no archery or protection from it without elven help<br>
<br>
Best Bet (IMO) –<br>
<br>
Merry, FotB/Hobbit Sword/Elven Cloak/Stone Trolls: About as strong as an eventless hobbit can get.<br>
<br>
Gandalf, servant of the Secret Fire<br>
<br>
He is Gandalf. He is a bad man. Nuf said.<br>
<br>
Good Points –<br>
<br>
1.	Strong and tough. About as good a fighter as Aragorn, sometimes better. Can reach a power of 10 unarmed.<br>
2.	Spells and support cards. They kick butt.<br>
3.	Glamdring. One of the best weapons in the game.<br>
<br>
Bad Points –<br>
<br>
1.	Card Intensive. If you play Gandalf, you play Gandalf. To work well his deck requires lots of his spells and support cards. <br>
2.	Loner. Nothing of Gandalf helps the other races all that much. A little but not much.<br>
3.	Shmoes. His helper allies aren’t usually that much of a big help and are site 1 and thus don’t fight.<br>
4.	Costly. Gandalf isn’t afraid of the shadow and thus your twilight cost can get pretty high with this deck<br>
<br>
Best Bet (IMO) –<br>
<br>
Gandalf, FotS/other races/Glamdring: Power 9-12 Gandalf, not too shabby.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that is it for now. Next time, the evil hordes of Middle-Earth.<br>
