Destiny 4<br>
Use 2 Force to deploy on an opponent's droid (except R2-D2 and C-3PO), 1 on your droid. When either player draws a destiny matching the number of characters at same site, droid 'explodes' (all characters present are lost).<br>
<br>
Your Starters should be as follows:  The dark side operative object using fondor and the forest.  First off, this will freak the hell out of your opponent.  Now I don't know how many times Steve Brentson asked me if there were fondor ops before our game with this deck because he was really confused, and that's one of the greatest aspects of this deck, it just plays with your opponents head the entire time.  To start use oppressive enforcement.  A: to make sure your Program traps and counter assaults and 3720-1s don't get sensed or altered.  And B: all your dreads and star destroyers will be destiny +1 which is a major bonus in this deck seeing how it all depends on destiny.<br>
<br>
Now I have blasted people for playing cheese in the past.  But this deck is all about droid numbers.  The only problem this deck had MAJOR trouble against was speeder ops, and even then steve brenston only beat this thing by 25.  Mainly what this thing does is get droids out on the ground, it doesn't matter which droids or which sites just get them out there spread across as many sites as you can so you can insert 3720-1.  This is a major point of force damage as this deck works best against EPP beatdown.<br>
<br>
The second point of strategy is to drain in space.  Using a few star destroyers, and a bunch of Dreadnaughts you spread over about 4 systems and just drain your opponent as much as you can.  If you are playing HB this wont be so bad if you just concentrate on one system fighting if you have to, because you can still use your numbers to make them lose a lot of force due to the fact that most HB decks don't use too many ability characters.  And for this deck's purposes, neither should you.	One character of ability, EPP vader is all that you need, and all that you should have.<br>
<br>
Now those are the two conventional methods for delivering damage to your opponent, now here comes the tech, and the strategy behind this article.  Play 5 counter assaults and 5 program traps.  Most LS decks are going to play with an EPP hit squad down at a site to at least drain you.  Here's where the droids come in.  All those droids you are using for numbers.. yea get em to a site where the EPPs are.	Now and only now do you put program trap on a droid, if he is present with the opponents characters.  This deck is designed to take a drain deck out.  And you may say 'But not everyone plays a drain deck'	The thing is, peoples decks will turn into drain decks when they cant fight any of your characters so they will spread theirs thin, or at least thin enough for you to draw a destiny taking out their characters.  The next question you may have 'How are you going to draw destinies to blow up people without battles?'  Here is where the counter assaults come in.  Now you can have U3p0 at a site with 3 EPPS drain<br>
ing you and you can counter assault it drawing three destiny.  The average destiny in this kind of deck is a little over 3 because of the added destiny on the starships and the insane number of 4 destiny on the droids and the program traps, as well as the threes on counter assault and 3720-1 (which you should use 4).	Taking on 3 epps is risky with a lot of 4s and 3s of destiny but when it pays off its worth it.  Let me give you an example:<br>
<br>
EPP Han, Leia, and Luke are at a battle ground site with R5A2 who in turn has a program trap deployed on him.  Now the opponent really doesn't know what is going on so he/she force drains you.  You play counter assault and draw 5,5,and4. BOOOOM!! Program Trap goes off Kiling everyone at the site.  What this means is that for the counter assault your total destiny is 14 and their total power is yes ZERO, they lose 14 force and you are in the money.  Now the trick to this is fitting in a bunch of 7s and recycling them with reactor terminal.  This trick wont happen often but I promise you it does, you can check out my NYC grand slam Treport where I took out EPP han and leia, as well as Ben Kenobi and a Bomarr Monk with this.  And because you have so many droids, Program Traps, counter assaults and numbers, you can have people losing 30 a turn on a perfect sequence.<br>
<br>
Now your opponent is obviously going to catch on and try not to force drain you where you have program trap deployed.  This will help because even if you don't have a counter assault in hand, the other player is still far to scared to even try force draining there.  So the opponent spreads out his characters making it easier to blow them up because we all know its a lot easier to pull 3s than 6s.  Tracking is also a major part to this deck if you can pull it off its amazing to play.<br>
<br>
Vader should be used as a last resort in case some really weak non unique character is stranded somewhere or something to that effect so you can use him to beat the hell out of someone.  Other than that you can even just use him in space to add 3 power to a random ship of your choice.<br>
<br>
So all in all that's all there is to it.  2 versions of the deck are posted at my member page and of course you can read the tourney report from the NYC grand slam I mentioned earlier also found on my tourney page.  At the grand slam I told Kendrick Summers about this deck and he was cracking up for a while, and started laughing every time he saw me after that just saying 'Dude that rocks, that just rocks'  so have fun with this deck if you play in a fun league or just like to @#$% around with your buddies drinking beers and playing swccg.  I probably wont be playing this deck at worlds or the regionals (Sorry Kashyyyk) but ill have a copy and if you want a fun game when you see me there just ask me and ill be sure to blow up some of your mains.	Take care<br>
