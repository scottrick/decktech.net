<br>
First off, some of you may not know what this phrase means.  Let's break it down and define it.  'Card' meaning the playing cards that you use in the game of Starwars:Customizable Card Game.  'Advantage' - meaning - Any condition, circumstance, opportunity, or means, particularly favorable<br>
  to success, or to any desired end; benefit.  So put them together and you have an aspect in which you try to gain some sort of benefit over your opponent by using cards that provide efficiency.  Now that all the big words are over with, lets define this in layman's terms.  Card Advantage<br>
is anything you can do to get the upper hand on your opponent by means of deck construction (or what you put in your deck).  One of the easiest ways to help build a more 'efficient' deck is to use Used Interrupts that have a high destiny number.  Some examples of these interrupts are Weapon<br>
Levitation, Out of Commision, and/or Shocking Information.  Now these interrupts have primary purposes but most of those uses are only good in certain situations.  For instance, Shocking Information can really put a Manipulator (one that uses interrupts to manipulate your deck to the opponents<br>
liking)in a bind, but against any other deck that doesn't use search cards this may become a wasted card slot to some people...but to a person utilizing card efficiency this becomes a staple card in their deck.  The reason being is that it handicaps one specific deck type and if they opponent is not playing that deck type, then it is a used destiny 5 that can be recirculated and tracked for a destiny draw of some sort.  This brings us to another aspect of Card Advantage, deck counting.  If you have the ability to track a card with high destiny then the randomness is significantly reduced when drawing destiny.  I, personally, put this under the definition of Card Advantage because this does give you the upper hand against your opponent and it will help you to track certain cards needed to setup a combo and help you to become a better player.  Another example of using Card Advantage to benefit you is knowing when to play cards that will become used rather then lost.  For example, in your Tatooine Celebration deck you use a couple tunnel visions, it is your control phase and you control three sites, so this means you will retreive three cards.  In your hand you have a tunnel vision and a large force pile.	This is where some people will lose their edge and become spiratic.  I have seen many people get so excited that they are retreiving cards, they forget about what is in their hand.  So they retreive their cards and then play the tunnel vision. This is not very advantageous.  During your control phase, use the tunnel vision to pull that nabrium or Ben Kenobi, and then celebrate to retreive the tunnel vision you just used.  You are now at more of an advantage then your opponent, there is no card in SWCCG that lets you pull a card out of your force pile that is also a used interrupt, but you just made one.  The final aspect (of my article) is using cards that will let you search or otherwise manipulate your deck to your advantage.  One of the more notable combos is How did we get into this mess, this card lets you look at a whole new hand.  Now your opponent is at a disadvantage because you now are looking at a new hand and your opponent doesn't have the same benefit.  Now coupled with the immediate effect, Descent into the Dark, now, if you have enough and the opponent doesn't cancel it, you can pull any card out of your deck.  This was one of the major aspects of the famed Maelstrom engine.  You could set up Echo Base Operations or Operatives with this engine, in no time at all. This provides you with the best card advantage ( in my opinion).<br>
