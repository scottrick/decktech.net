This is in my honest opinion, how to make a good deck using all the cards, the steps that I take to make a deck and why certain cards make it and certain ones don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
For this deck making sake lets assume that we are just making a good ole fashion Tatooine deck with Aliens and Imperials so that we don&#146;t play favorites.<br>
<br>
Okay first off you need to figure out how many locations your going to want to use. For this deck we are going to use Tatooine (the planet). Now that we have our starting location we need to then decide which sites we want. To go about this you want to use sites that will both offer you good force activation and decent force drainging potential. So for that we will use the following locations:<br>
<br>
Tatooine<br>
Tatooine: Cantina<br>
Tatooine: Judland Waste<br>
Tatooine: Lars Moisture Farm<br>
Tatooine: Jabba&#146;s Palace<br>
Jabba&#146;s Palace: Audience Chamber<br>
Jabba&#146;s Palace: Dungeon<br>
Passanger Deck<br>
<br>
Okay, now why&#146;d I choose these locations, well Tatooine: Cantina gives 2 force to both me and my opponent, while that is not the best thing to give them force, I can force drain their for 2 a turn. The Judland Waste and Lars Moisture Farm each offer 1 force for both sides, but I can force drain their for a +1 and I get a +1 weapon destiny draw at Lars Moisture Farm. The Passanger Deck is there for the 2 force that it provides for you and the cost of making your aliens cheaper when they deploy inside and Tatooine: Jabba&#146;s Palace and the Audience Chamber are their because they offer me 2 force and my oppponent can&#146;t revolution them and cut the force from me. As well the Dungeon is there to give me 1 force and to drop off any prisioners that I may pick up through out the game. Okay, now we have our sites and the reason why. Let&#146;s choose our Starting Interrput, for this deck I am going to use Prepared Defense which will allow me to get 3 Effects that are Immune to Alter and play on table. So the options are grand indeed so lets use:<br>
<br>
Imperial Arrest Order<br>
Power Of The Hutt<br>
No Bargain<br>
<br>
Now these 3 Effects are chosen for their usefullness Imperial Arrest Order for getting Docking Bays, yes I know their are not Docking Bays in the deck, but it also adds a +2 to the forfit of some of the unique ability 2 Imperials as well as it only allows the playing of Nabrum Leids/Ellis Helrot during any phase and limits it to the move phase only and exterior sites only as well. This is good cause you don&#146;t want the beat down squad coming to hurt your little guys. Power of the Hutt is chosen because it allows me to get certain key characters out of my deck when I need them and allows me to get certain cards that will be displayed later, and finally No Bargain to make those Rebels more expensive if they try to come into my Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
Now we have our Starting site, our starting interrupt and cards to go with it lets move onto characters: (we could easily make this a Court or any other Alien infested deck as well but I want to use some Imperials to show them as well)<br>
<br>
Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith x2<br>
Grand Moff Tarkin<br>
Mara Jade, The Emperor&#146;s Hand<br>
Emperor Palpatine <br>
Janus Greejatus<br>
Sim Aloo<br>
The Might Jabba<br>
Jabba<br>
Boelo<br>
Ephant Mon<br>
Boba Fett With Blaster<br>
Jodo Kast<br>
4-LOM With Concussion Rifle<br>
IG-88 With Riot Gun<br>
Bane Malar<br>
Dannik Jericho<br>
Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Baba<br>
Snoova<br>
Officer Evax<br>
Mosep<br>
Gailid<br>
Xizor<br>
Guri<br>
<br>
Okay we have our characters their the normal characters that you would see in most decks. However again if this was an Alien swarm S&amp;V deck then I would take out the Imperials but again I wanted to use the Imperials to show them as well for the beginners. As for the choice of characters the Darth Vader, Dark Lords were chosen for their choke ability because we want this deck to have some higher destinies to use that ability and alot of people are playing Smugglers and their ability is a 3 on average. Tarkin&#146;s in their cause he goes with Darth Vader and that&#146;s that. Mara Jade, again standard. Emperor Palpatine because he&#146;s got the stuff that people need to have that &quot;fear&quot; inspired to win and of course his chronies are needed cause where he goes they go and Janus is pure &#146;Tech&#146; allowing you to recycle any 1 card to draw the top 1 of your Reserve deck and Sim adds his share of happiness to the group. You&#146;ll notice 2 Jabbas were chosen (little) Jabba from Special Edition and The Might Jabba (from OTJPSD) the reason being is that &quot;little&quot; Jabba allows for cheaper deploy of your aliens, however that&#146;s useful in the beginning The Might Jabbas ability of 4 is nicer, as well as his not being able to be targeted till all other people are targetted first at his location is usefull as well. Boelo and Ephant Mon are their because they are his cronies and in the Chamber they hold thier own following them is Boba Fett With Blaster, when he&#146;s with Jabba he add&#146;s another destiny and with certain Interrupts that will make it even nastier. Jodo Kast is there for his Mandalorian Armor and that&#146;s for the Hidden Weapons which will be explained when they come up. 4-LOM and IG-88 w/Weapons are key to most any deck and should be there for their usefullness of capturing immediately and cancelling the game text of another. Bane Malar is their for his ability of 4 which is always nice and his ability to &#146;mind scan&#146; is usefull especially if Chewbacca is around that makes him power 7. Dannik is in because he eats soup and that removes people permanently from the game. Dr. E &amp; Ponda Baba are power 6, draw destiny and can operate, their key to alot of decks and quite usefull on their own for that quick hit and run if needed. Snoovas their to remove someone from the battle or just plain out capture them, just remember to get his Axe out of the deck for this to work. Officer Evax for his high forfit and usefullness in both space and on the ground. Mosep and Gailid are their to increas Force loss and Xzior and Guri are there for their nastiness of killing off characters and the lightside not being able to draw destiny or having it cancelled.<br>
So now we have our characters and why they were chosen next we move onto weapons:<br>
<br>
Vader&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Mara Jade&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Vibro Axe<br>
<br>
These three were choosen for their respective people adding to force drains and helping exclude people in battles as well as just being usefull on the character.<br>
<br>
As for the ships well that&#146;s simples we&#146;ll use the following:<br>
<br>
Zuckuss In Mist Hunter<br>
Bossk In Hounds Tooth<br>
Virago<br>
Stinger<br>
Jabba&#146;s Sail Barge<br>
<br>
Zuckuss In Mist Hunter is probably one of the best ships Dark Side has, with your opponenet needing 7 ability to draw a destiny that&#146;s critical at key times. Bossk In Hounds Tooth is there for the extra destiny draws as are the Virago and Stinger, which can be piloted by Xzior and Guri thus making your space formidable with them all at Tatooine you have enough power and 4 destinies and that can really help if needed Jabba&#146;s Sail Barge is there to move about and to get that Passanger Bay out as well for added force.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now onto Interrupts and Effects we don&#146;t want to go to high with these because were limited remember it&#146;s only a 60 card deck so we have to make do with what we can so let&#146;s choose wisely.<br>
<br>
Sense/Uncertain Is The Future x2<br>
Sniper/Dark Strike<br>
First Strike<br>
Point Man<br>
Jabba&#146;s Through With You x2<br>
Non Shall Pass<br>
Battle Order<br>
Presence Of The Force x2<br>
Expand The Empire<br>
Hutt Smooch/Defensive Fire<br>
Prepared Defense<br>
All Wrapped Up<br>
What&#146;re You Tryin&#146; To Push On Us<br>
Bounty<br>
<br>
Okay, now we have our red, Sense/Uncertain Is The Future is a great card, if your stuck with stuff in your hand and can&#146;t use that right now drop your hand and draw a new one and most of all you get to mess your opponent up as well making him do the same thing, and if in a pinch you need to cancel and interrupt you can with the Sense. Snipe/Dark Strike are their to get rid of a character in the Control phase or add to your own ability in the battle, First Strike to battle and retrieve a force and also to make your opponent spend a force to use that Ghhhk or other interrupt during the battle phase. Point Man, pure &#146;Tech&#146; against Order To Engage, cause nothing sucks more than having Jabba and crew sitting in the Chamber across from a BoShuda, Tessek, Rennek, Worrt combo. Jabba&#146;s Through With You is a recyclable 5, that allows you to add a destiny when you fire a weapon with the three that you have that are permanent and Vibro Axe that&#146;s a good chance that you&#146;ll have one out to use that with (it doesn&#146;t work w/Light Sabers), Battle Order is their to battle for free when you control Tatooine which shouldn&#146;t pose a problem with your space and force your opponent to spend 3 to force drain which limits him severely and works well for you. Presence Of The Force is there to increase force draining as well as Expand The Empire being there to work on either Judland Wastes or Lars Moisture Farm to enhance more Force Drain potential. Hutt Smooch/Defensive Fire to get rid of that stupid Undercover spy or just get rid of a card in your opponents hand both quite useful. Prepared Defense, well that&#146;s your Starting Interrupt, All Wrapped Up so that you can capture your opponenets people with your Bounty Hunters when they loose them from the battle and you can drop them off at the Dungeon for a retrieval of 2 (unless their Bountied then you get more) which brings us to the Bounty place that on someone and then go get em, once you drop them off you get your Bounty back and can do it again and again, finally theirs What&#146;re You Tryin&#146; To Push On Us, that&#146;s a grabber card used to snag that annoying useful card that your opponent keeps using this will stop that and slow him down some more.<br>
<br>
So, now we have a complete Tatooine deck with lots to use and do. I know that there are alot of cards that I could have switched out and cards I could have just taken out but this is a beginning deck for people to see what a deck could look like if you don&#146;t like the deck please don&#146;t rate the report poorly because of it and remeber that this is an Article.. Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
So in conclusion we have our deck, with 60 cards, and it&#146;s ready to go out in the world and beat down everyone. :)<br>
Good Luck!!!<br>
