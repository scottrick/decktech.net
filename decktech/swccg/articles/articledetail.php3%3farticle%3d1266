<br>
second, this article is intended to illustrate some of the best ways to cheat while you play star wars ccg.. it is by no means a comprehensive guide, but trust me (and ive seen it happen) cheaters do win regularily at starwars when facing people that dont watch them (read: inexperienced or naive players)... this article was inspired by an article i just read about catching people cheating.. a lot of people on the reviews were thanking the person who wrote it for teaching them how to cheat.. well in my experience (since about ANH in sanctioned tournaments, since premeir as a player) ive seen a lot of cheaters, and im proud not to count myself one of them.. but hey, im more than willing to provide all of you villain hopefuls out there with some ammunition.. get ready, pull up a chair, and lets get dishonest, cause here comes the cheater's guide to cheating..<br>
<br>
<br>
well start simple..<br>
<br>
cheat 1: activate too much force:<br>
<br>
there are several ways of beating a choke deck.. one is to play sites, anti revo, and cards like jabba and imperial supply.. the second is to activate more cards from the top of your deck than are allowed by the number of icons on the table..  this can be accomplished in several different ways.. however, as a side note, dont do this with no force already active, youll get caught.. leave at least 5 or 6 so the addition will get murky in your opponent's head.. its always easy to argue about when you deployed a character or played an interrupt.. its not easy when youve got no force left and suddenly youve activated 4 extra..<br>
<br>
ok, now that weve got that out of the way, the first (and imo best) way to activate too much force is to do what i call 'doubling'.. this is grabbing more than one card at a time when you activate 'one' force for an icon on the table.. its good because some opponents tend to count based on the number of cards or motions they see you make.. there really arent any extra motions made when you do this..	remember that in cheating, like in magic, you want to distract your opponent from what your intentions are by focussing them on something else.. ask how many cards are in hand, or what their power at a location is while youre counting your cards out.. or even just start talking to them.. the idea is to remove their focus from your activation..<br>
<br>
the second way to activate too many is to activate cards so fast that your opponent has no idea how many youve activated because their senses cant keep up with you.. this is for ameteurs and itll get you caught 5 times out of 7..<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheat Number Two: Stacking and Drawing<br>
<br>
This cheat is a lot like the first, but its got a number of variations and uses.. what it is, is manipulating the cards in your piles through take-backs, and intentional screw ups in activation.. an example: youve activated a card to the bottom of your force pile, but you need it in hand right now.. so what do you do?? you play something that uses all of your force, and then take it back, replacing the cards in the order that they were AFTER you played the card.. then you ask a question that requires attention by your opponent (notice the distraction theme) and because youve left your hand on your force pile, you grab the top card, leaving your hand on the pile, and fold your hands together (with the original hand in the hand not on your force pile).. then just shuffle your hand, and give your opponent a poker face as you play the card you just drew...<br>
<br>
another distraction technique that works well with this is starting a rules debate about a technicality, and then cheating while theyre busing checking the game-text.. remember also that this can be done in reverse, by placing a card with a correct destiny number on the top of your deck, or by moving a card from the force pile to reserve deck..<br>
<br>
Cheat Three: Destiny..<br>
<br>
if you draw a 6, you want it up again as soon as possible right?? but what if you battle at multiple locations or want to move?? well, just leave your destiny on the table, and then at the end of your turn, before replacing your cards, move the destiny card to the used pile.. this works with stuff like nabrun/elis too..<br>
<br>
Cheat Four: Search cards<br>
<br>
Its Hard to tell when a stack of cards is one or two high.. when you search your deck for an effect/character/ship/interrupt/location with a card, place them both on the top of your reserve, and then grab them both at the same time together (in the same manner as the 'double') and show your opponent the top card.. better yet, dont verify at all, place them on top of your hand, and then when asked to verify, show the top card, which will obviously be correct.. just make sure you get the cards on top of your hand before they ask to verify, and theyll have a nearly impossible time catching you if they havent asked how many cards are in your hand every turn of the game.. this is especially effective when all you have is interrupts and a twi lek, when you really need that choke lord..<br>
<br>
Cheat 5: lying<br>
<br>
if your opponent asks how many cards are in your hand, and you have 13, say you have 12.. if they ask if youve got 6 ability or if you get a destiny where you dont, say you do, or draw one by default at places like LS kashyyyk and DS jundland waste.. if you miss draws on sense or alter, quickly replace them into your used pile and act as if they were successful.. intentionally miscount your power at locations when asked by two or three, or mistotal your power after destiny.. dont forfeit enough from locations.. use hand or leia as 7 instead of 6.. lose battle damage by counting down from the highest number to ONE.. this reduces the loss by one.. intentionally forget how much youve already lost by asking a question, and then ask how much youve already lost and argue about what they said.. before trying these, muddy the waters a bit by throwing something engaging at them like a rules question or another mistake or something.. distraction from what youre actually doing.. just remember that..<br>
<br>
also, pay less than the cost for deploying characters.. just automatically deploy -1, and do it quickly, again with distraction.. or ingore cards like goo nee tay on the table..<br>
<br>
Cheat 6: Shuffles..<br>
<br>
place the cards you need evenly throughout your deck, then cut your deck to shuffle it (instead of bridging it) at roughly equal intervals.. so that it returns to the orignal position..<br>
<br>
or just dont shuffle at all after you put the cards in. again, make sure you call attention to some other aspect of the game while you do it..<br>
<br>
Cheat 7: Slow It Down<br>
<br>
Play slow from the beggining.. question every rule, everything that isnt explicitly stated on the cards, and even everything that is.. read every interrupt the opponent plays like youve never seen it before, and then ponder the effects of that card on the game as a whole before continuing.. you should always participate in your opponent's turns, so it becomes a routine and not a singal for cheating.. ask the number of cards in hand, the number of force active, and the power at locations regularily, so that you can do it while you cheat as well without it being anomolous.. this also has the effect of slowing the game down considerably, so that in the endgame, youll have the chance to think about moves for long enough to stall out the timed win..<br>
<br>
Cheat 8: Forgery<br>
<br>
If you have a copy of a ruling you like, and it gets changed, keep the old copy and show it to opponents. or make up your own rulings, and put markt or juz's header on there... either way, theyll have no way of countering your 'hard evidence'.. and a lot of tournament directors wont be knowledgable enough to contradict you, so theyll be on your side because of your 'document'..<br>
<br>
Cheat 9: Cunning<br>
<br>
Let false things about your deck slip before the game.. say 'damn, i thought i was gonna lose last time when my trooper assualt got sensed' or 'wow, my beggar/Draw their fire combo is on fire today'... then until they act upon it, play the game like youre actually doing what you claimed to..<br>
<br>
or let things slip during the game like 'wow, i wish i could  draw one of the like 8 revolutions in my opening hand'.. this also could serve as a distraction method.. itll definitely cause them to recheck their status, leaving a critical oppotunity for a cheat method to be applied..<br>
<br>
Cheat 10: Destiny Revisited<br>
<br>
If you see a card you want come up for destiny, instead of tracking it, put the card in your used pile facing the wrong direction (with 'starwars' the opposite way of the other cards) or put a card in a sleeve facing the opposite direction of the other sleeves..<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
This article has not been about the so called 'middle ground' between cheating and not cheating.. it has been a tutorial on how to outfox your opponent using the most dishonest methods possible in an attempt to instruct you in the basics of how distraction and manpulation work toward your favor.. just remember, the key to getting caught is making the opponent's 'watchful eye' watch the wrong thing!!<br>
<br>
Ok, in all seriousness, this article is intended as a joke, but i have seen all of these (as well as the methods earlier discussed in other articles by other people) in games throughout my swccg 'career' in REAL tournaments.. the key to stopping things like this is NEVER taking your eye off of your opponent.. dont let them put their hand down next to their deck, or put things into their hand and then deploy things that were supposed to deploy from reserve, and if you suspect them of activating two or more (hard to catch) ask them how much force they have before they activate any, and then ask after they activate.. this will save you the trouble of remembering from the previous turns or the last time their force pile was empty.. most of all, dont let the distraction techniques work.. ask them to count their hand face down.. ask them to turn their cards the same direction before the game.. WATCH THEM while you do things like scan their hand or activate your own force, or count the power in your battles.. never take your eye off of them, and pay attention to the game situation if you have to.. dont get up to go get the TD without the other person getting up as well..<br>
<br>
so i hope you guys take this with a grain of salt, and have fun cheatng your way to victory against incredible odds ;)<br>
