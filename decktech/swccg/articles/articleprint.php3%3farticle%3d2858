It has all the game mechanics necessary to make it nearly unstoppable. Key word is &quot;nearly.&quot; Strong as any deck is, like any deck, it has chinks in its armor. Unfortunately these chinks seem to be small and unnoticable when you see the actual suit. My hope is with this article to put a magnifying glass on those chinks. As usual, I will make my disclaimer: I do not claim to be any authority on anything. Merely a seasoned player who makes an attempt to look at a popular strategy and give you, the people, the power to successfully beat it. <br>
<br>
Watch Your Step gains its power through its easy flip and ridiculous benefits once achieved. The decks key strong points are: 1. No sense and alter for anyone, so everything the Light player plays goes through, unless Dark has a direct counter; 2. Playing interrupts from the lost pile, basically allowing you more than a 60 card deck; 3.Extra battle destiny which guarantees winning the war of attrition; 4. Cheap characters that allow flipping and battling relatively easy.<br>
<br>
Appealing, yes? Why would anyone want to play anything else? What can stop that? Well, let&#146;s take an in depth look.<br>
<br>
In order to try to play against WYS, we first must recognize that there are different types of WYS. Of these, there are 3 popular concepts: 1. The 1-turn beatdown; 2. Podracing; and 3. Out-retrieval (Harvest, Celebration). Often you will find more than one of these combined in an average WYS deck. These all have some common themes against them,  so even before we look at the decktypes, let&#146;s take a look at what the common themes are, and then get more specific as we move on.<br>
<br>
1. Pick your battles: This is what Eric Hunter said to me once after trouncing me with his WYS. The Dark player must be cautious not to make 2 fatal mistakes against this deck: 1. Battling the opponent without some planning 2.Giving  the opponent the opportunity to battle you on his turn. The second one sounds far fetched, but when I say that, this is what I mean. Opponent has EPP Luke at a site; Dark player deploys some people and battles; Luke runs away via playing &quot;Dodge.&quot; Now Dark is stuck at the site, set up for a Run, Luke Run one turn beatdown. How to stop this? Lets go a little further with some card choices.<br>
<br>
-Ghhk/Those Rebels: This card really does the trick against this deck. Cancels reacts, which cancels Dodge. It also cancels heavy battle damage dealt out by a Bad Feeling beatdown. Team this card up with Wipe Them Out, All of Them and a grabber and your opponent will have a tough time ending the game quickly.<br>
<br>
-Pinned Down: What? (as Stone Cold would say) Is that really a card? This scanned over Endor uncommon can be useful in stopping characters from running away.  Here&#146;s the text:<br>
<br>
Deploy on your side of table. Opponent may not &#146;react&#146; away from a battle where you have a blaster present. Also, if you have a blaster present when opponent cancels a battle, draw destiny, opponent loses Force equal to destiny draw. (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
So what? Well, Boba Fett With Blaster or Dengar With Blaster say something about running away like a schoolgirl. Opponent can&#146;t run, so he&#146;s got to fight, allowing you to pick your battles. You can even start with it.<br>
<br>
-Blast Door Controls: Stops Barrier, stops Narrow Escape. I pack this in every deck, and it makes all the difference in the world. It allows you to go through with your plan, rather than allowing the opponent a little extra time to deploy what he drew last turn. Destiny 5 to boot.<br>
<br>
Basically, if you can pick your battles, you can be the one doing a one turn beatdown, rather than the opponent. It also allows you to move away from a dangerous situation should things get out of hand. Much of playing against this deck has to do with battling, as the deck is designed to battle. So being able to battle effeciently and having the tools necessary to deal with all contingencies make your ability to defeat this deck that much more feasible (that was a mouthful). <br>
<br>
-Character Removal: The last part of picking your battles is getting rid of the opponent&#146;s characters. Dr. E., Iggy, You Are Beaten, Capturing and Dark Strike all give you the ability to remove the opponent&#146;s characters. But when defending a battle, you need to be able to have force in order to do so, thus the dilemma. Which brings us to...<br>
<br>
2. Beggar/Frozen Assets: Sure, you&#146;ve all seen it. Draw Their Fire and this makes a one turn beatdown managable. There are a few good ways to beat this, and they are obvious: Televan Koreyy, Main Course and Wipe Them Out, All of Them. I prefer Wipe Them Out for the better destiny and the ability to give you some room to breath (also restricts battle destiny if opponent is using non-unique smugglers). Use Wipe Them Out to activate a force, then use that force to play Combat Readiness (cyclable 5), draw destiny, and activate some more. Main Course is also nice with this, as Han is usually with an alien, and often without a protocol droid (unless with R2&amp;3PO for the anal retentive). You can start with this one too.<br>
<br>
2. Force Choke: Anything you can use to force choke the opponent is a good thing, no matter what the deck is. Give your opponent force, you give him the fuel for his war machines. Take out an opponent&#146;s resources and you cut off his ability to fight and cause damage.<br>
<br>
Card Choices: <br>
-His Name Is Anakin: Nobody plays this, and that&#146;s exactly why WYS does so well. WYS really doesn&#146;t generate that much...about 10-12 force maximum...and that&#146;s mid-late game. This card taxes about 2/3 of the characters invoved in this deck to some degree. Big deal! Its one force extra each! That adds up after a while, and its +2 against Dark Jedi.<br>
<br>
-Bad Feeling Have I: There are many counters to this card, but that is again, why not many people play with it. People seem to think that once a counter has been made for a card, that everyone plays with it, thereby making the card useless. This card affects the other 1/3 of the characters in WYS, making all of the opponent&#146;s characters expensive to deploy. This forces the opponent to save force, which is fine by them so they can just play Tunnel Vision later to get a key card. However, this can buy you some time to strike at what the opponent already has on the table. R2 and 3PO could give you problems, but couple this with Look Sir Droids, and you&#146;re fine.<br>
 <br>
-Battle Order/First Strike: Not the best idea on its own arguably, but Tatooine Maul parked against low ability smugglers can make the damage the opponent deals to you expensive. Now the opponent has to chose whether or not to drain you, or deploy and battle. So much of the game is about decisions that making the wrong one can be costly. Add Come Here You Big Coward and see if they can retrieve anything.<br>
<br>
-Secret Plans: Tax the retrieval along with everything else - who doesn&#146;t play with this?<br>
<br>
3. Place opponent&#146;s cards out of play before they get a chance to: There are a few ways of doing this, some popular, some not.<br>
<br>
-Grabbers, grabbers, grabbers: With there being 4 useful grabbers in the game, one can grab up to 4 interrupts during any game against WYS. In fact, it might be a good idea to start Allegations of Corruption against WYS, if only to grab something key. This deck usually focuses on a few key interrupts to control the game. Examples of these are Control/Tunnel Vision, Sorry About the Mess/Blaster Proficiency, Run Luke, Run, any Bad Feeling Card, Power Pivot, A Step Backward, etc. The list goes on and on. Playing interrupts from the lost pile makes this deck insanely versatile, and allows the opponent the luxury of not having the right card in hand. Grabbers stop the abuse.<br>
<br>
-Dannik Jericho/Amanaman: These guys suck. They really do. They shine with their gametext, which is really the only reason why they aren&#146;t coasters. Placing characters out of play limits the options WYS can do. Kill of all his ability &gt;3 characters and your opponent can&#146;t battle where Tatooine Maul is. Place Han out of play and the Bad Feeling damage doesn&#146;t get tripled. Eat some characters and kiss them goodbye.<br>
<br>
-Probe Telemetry: This could work well with an ISB deck or a Hunt The Queen deck (Yes, I know Hunt The Queen sucks). Who&#146;d want to use probe droids anyway? Well if it means placing Control/Tunnel Visions, or Out of Commissions, or On or Off The Edges, or Ralltiir Freighter Captains, or stupid cards like that out of play, would you do it? This also works against retrieval, by the by. Destiny 4 Used Interrupt. Couple your droids with Forced Servitude to eat some damage too.<br>
<br>
-Hunt Down/BHBM: Get rid of Luke, you get rid of some of the deck&#146;s power. These decks practically incapacitate him, leaving room for Maul to roam free. <br>
<br>
I&#146;m not going to go into every possible card combo that can deal with WYS. From the looks of things, it seems as though there are quite a few cards out there to deal with this menace, yet the tournament scene still somehow seems to be over-run by this objective. <br>
<br>
On that note, I&#146;m going to get into the more specific decktypes, but only with the next article. Because there are so many mechanics to Watch Your Step and so many variations of a theme, there&#146;s just too much for just one article. The next article will take a look at the different types listed earlier, and applying the methods learned here to counteract them.
