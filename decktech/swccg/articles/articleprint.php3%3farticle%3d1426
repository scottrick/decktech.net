<br>
	Imagine you&amp;#8217;re spread out on Raltiir with tempest scouts ready to move as a react to your opponent&amp;#8217;s tiniest move.	You&amp;#8217;re probably feeling pretty confident right now, set up for a big drain next turn and your opponent will have to dedicate an enormous force to even start damaging you, which he does . . .<br>
<br>
	Now it&amp;#8217;s his turn, and as soon as his deploy phase comes around, he drops down an EPP beatdown party and a Romas Lock Navander, or maybe Corporal Beezer at the same site as your lone Tempest Scout 5.  He&amp;#8217;s cut off your reacts, you don&amp;#8217;t happen to have a Ghhhk, and you ending up losing thirty force, maybe the game in one turn.  How do you avoid this type of thing?!  Some people have been complaining about the new enhanced premiere and other enhanced cards, saying that they&amp;#8217;re just too powerful.   Not really.  With a little creativity and some good old dark side cruelty, the EPP team might think twice about battling the grand Imperial army.<br>
<br>
	Here are a few methods of stopping an EPP beatdown party:<br>
1.  Simply making your opponents characters cost more to deploy.<br>
2.  Taking his characters out while they are still in his hand<br>
3.  Sending his characters back to his hand.<br>
4.    Canceling opponent&amp;#8217;s battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Option 1: Making your opponents characters cost more to deploy effectively cuts<br>
down on the numbers of characters he can send at you at one time, as well as cutting down on the number of cards left in his reserve deck for destinies.  The Ralltiirr Operations objective is great for making it that much harder for your opponent to deploy his characters.  All of his rebels are deploy +2 to your sites (every Light side Enhanced Premiere character is a Rebel), meaning your opponent will end up spending near 25 force trying to attack you, which, if late in the game, just isn&amp;#8217;t available for him.  It also means he will have to keep characters back in his hand so he has enough cards left in his reserve deck to draw weapon and battle destinies.  He&amp;#8217;ll probably have to save up for a couple of turns to attack you, which means you will have warning and time to prepare, as well as another turn of draining to help your differential if you lose.  Another card that does this just as effectively and works in any deck is Bad Feeling Have I.  BFHI makes practically every main or enhanced character your opponent has deploy +2, added to the already high deploy costs of the EPP beatdown team.<br>
<br>
	Option 2: Taking his characters out of his hand is one of the oldest strategies in the book (well, not really, since I&amp;#8217;m not aware of any books on Star Wars Cards strategy yet), with most of the good cards for doing this dating back to the Premiere and New Hope sets.  The simplest and cheapest way of doing this is the Scanning Crew, which can put a Rebel in your opponent&amp;#8217;s hand in his used pile.  However, there are many countermeasures to this, such as Shocking Information, that you might not enjoy.  Perhaps the most effective way of doing this is everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite Dark Side H&amp;#8217;nemthe:  Mii&amp;#8217;yoom Onith. Her ability may be costly, but it almost always promises results (again, watch out for Shocking Information)<br>
<br>
<br>
	Option 3:  Sending characters back to your opponent&amp;#8217;s hand is a great (and often unexpected) way of cutting a beatdown team down to size.  Some obvious ways of doing this are: Set for Stun, I&amp;#8217;d Rather Kiss a Wookiee, and None Shall Pass (for those Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace sites).  The first 2 are costly, but worth it &amp;#8211; all the force they used to deploy remains spent, plus they can&amp;#8217;t deploy it again (it may be hard to actually complete Set for Stun on the high-ability mains, however).  Also, with I&amp;#8217;d Rather Kiss a Wookiee they have to deploy it next turn, which is great if you eliminate the rest of the EPP gang!  Probably the best way of keeping a character out of a battle is the all-time favorite with any saber-wielding character, You are Beaten, to totally exclude a character from battling or moving until the end of your next turn (which also leaves you time for a Sniper!)<br>
<br>
	Option 4:  Canceling your opponent&amp;#8217;s battle destiny is one of my favorite ways to keep the beatdown party at bay, mainly because EPP likes to rely on a large battle destiny, often using cards like Don&amp;#8217;t Get Cocky, Gift of the Mentor, Skywalkers, I Know, and Life Debt to add multiple destinies.  To start off, limiting your opponent&amp;#8217;s destiny to one or two is VERY useful, i.e. &amp;#8211; the flipped Endor objective limits your opponent to one destiny, and Crush the Rebellion limits him to two destiny at Cloud City sites.  But my personal favorite is Wounded Wookiee, from Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace.  This card cancels all but two of your opponent&amp;#8217;s destiny, which means that he just wasted all whatever destiny adders he played AND you get to pick the destinies he picks (if you&amp;#8217;re not suicidal, you will cancel all the high ones and let him keep the low ones).  After that, canceling destinies is even better.  First it&amp;#8217;s everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite dark side combo:  Grand Moff Tarkin, and Darth Vader- to cancel any destiny, even a weapon or duel destiny for free!  However, your opponent probably isn&amp;#8217;t going to be dumb enough to attack you there.  Some less conspicuous ways of canceling destiny are 4-LOM with Concussion Rifle who cancel a character&amp;#8217;s game text, also canceling any destiny adding ability he has, and everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite Mandolorian-mockup, Jodo Kast!  Jodo is great for cutting down destiny adders.<br>
<br>
	So, next time &amp;#8211;don&amp;#8217;t be caught unawares by the EPP beatdown party.	Use good ol&amp;#8217; fashioned Dark Side know-how and take a bite out of cheesiness!<br>
