<br>
     With the release of every new set, the popular decks for the dark side are in some way altered.  The release of Coruscant will be no different.  We can expect to see much change in what decks will be played for the Dark Side.  <br>
<br>
     With the release of Tatooine the dark side took a heavy blow.  The release of cards like Don&#146;t do that again hurt many dark side decks which usually revolved around the mob points/IAO combo.  If players wanted to keep those decks, they had to hope nobody was playing Don&#146;t Do that Again.  The release of Qui Gon Jinn also hurt one very popular deck, Hunt Down.  THe dark side now had to deal with another jedi, one which could not be dueled.  With all of these problems coming up, players turned to decks like Dark Deal, Walker Garrison, and Agents of the Black Sun, which is usually played with podracing.  However, with the release of Coruscant the dark side will be shaken up once again. <br>
<br>
     You may start your landing is just one of several dark side &quot;helper&quot; cards from Tatooine which brought back some older dark side decks into the tournament scene.  With the new card players could pull Walker Garrison and also got some incredible direct damage to work with.  By combining it with Rebel Base occupation, the dark had a solid deck.  The deck was powerful both on the ground and at the Hoth system.  There were cards like Ice Storm and Trample, which could beat them off the ground.  The light side was defnitely hurting.  The only real &quot;tech&quot; that existed against this deck was to play the new character Yotts Orren who subtracts 2 from the power of each combat vehicle at a site and can pull Mechanical Failure.  By playing him and a bunch of mains the LS could set up a pretty good beat down, but even after that, the direct damage of You may start your landing and Rebel Base occupation usually won the DS the game.  But now, the light side has an answer to this deck.  Yotts Orren is still involved as is Mechanical failur, but another one of Yotts&#146; friends is going to see some play, Free Ride/Endor Celebration, a new split card being released in coruscant.  Endor celebration says cancel tatooine occupation, cloud city occupation, or rebel base occupation (immune to sense).  Yotts lets you pull Free Ride as well as mechanical Failure.  So, you bust out both of these and you kill 2 birds with one stone as you can set up a quality beat down and cancel rebel base occupation.  This deck is definitely in trouble come Coruscant&#146;s release.<br>
<br>
     I&#146;m Sorry is another Heler card from tatooine which brought back an older dark deck into tournament play.  When played with This Deal is Getting Worse All the Time, I&#146;m Sorry allowed the you to take two interior cloud city battleground sites into your hand, thus making it much more easy to set up Dark Deal.  Decks like Yuck...Wookie Breath, became very popular, using troopers to set up Dark Deal and cloud city Occupation very early and then bouncing the opponents characters back to their hand with I&#146;d Just as Soon Kiss a Wookie.  Other deal prototypes remained excellent decks even if they didn&#146;t set up deal quite as quickly as Wookie Breath.  Once agan however, Coruscant is changing the way a popular deck functions.  The dark side now has to deal with the immediate effect, A Vengeance in the Force.  Here is its text:      <br>
<br>
If you just lost more than 2 Force to a Force drain, deploy on opponentís location. You lose no more than 1 Force from Force drains here. At any time, you may place Immediate Effect in Used Pile to draw two cards from top of Reserve Deck.<br>
<br>
This card deals a tough blow to Dark Deal by lowering their drains at a site to one for the remainder of the game.  Also, they can have 3 of them out at a time so the Dark Side&#146;s drains are harmed greatly.  The only way around it is by playing lots of controls to cancel these.  At any rate, the deck will be effected by the release of this card, and we can expect to see a decline in its popularity.<br>
<br>
     Another deck which is sure to decline in popularity is Scum and Villany.  Scum was dealt some significant blows with the release of Tatooine (The camp, Qui Gon, etc.), but the deck was still quite viable, because of the lowering in deploy of your characters and retrieval that Scum and Villany brought.  However, this new effect, soon to be released with Coruscant, seems to be the nail in the coffin for Scum decks.  Here is it&#146;s text:<br>
<br>
Deploy on table. Unique Rebels of ability = 3 are power and forfeit +1 (or power and forfeit +2 if at a Cloud City or Jabbaís Palace site). While Han at a battleground, opponent retrieves no Force from Scum And Villainy. (Immune to Alter.) <br>
<br>
Any player of Scum cringes in fear at the site of this.  Of course, you may think, oh you can just go kill Han.  Well, often this can be very difficult, not to mention most people play multiple.  Also,  the card says while Han is at any BATTLEGROUND, so he can be at a battleground system and you won&#146;t be able to go shoot at him unless you are playing some odd-@ss cards.  This card is sure to see play also, because of its first part which increases rebels&#146; forfeit and power, and it can be started with HFTMF.  <br>
<br>
     So, thats 3 decks which we can expect to see less of with the release of Coruscant.  One more comes to mind.  it is Agents of the Black Sun.  This deck saw a good amount of play when combined with Podracing.  The deck would play multiple Emperor Palpatines and Prince Xizors to keep the direct damage of the objective going and combine that with the retrieval and direct damgae of Podracing.  However, with the release of Mace Windu, this deck will be dealt a significant blow.  Mace Windu&#146;s gametext says while he is at the Jedi Councel Chamber thingy and Amidala is at a battleground site and no Maul is on table, during each of your control phases opponent loses 2 force.  Agents of the black Sun limits the dark side&#146;s character deployment to black sun agents only and since Darth Maul isn&#146;t a Black Sun Agent, this can get real ugly real fast.  The light side will be dealing an automatic 2 damage during each of their control phases until the dark side can get rid of Amidala.  This could deter many players from using AOBS.  <br>
<br>
     So, now that we&#146;ve looked at some decks which we can expect to less of, what decks can we expect to see more of?  Well, for starters, Podracing should become more popular for the dark side with the release of the new dark side destiny 5 used interrupt, We Must Accelerate our Plans.  Here is its text:<br>
<br>
Use 3 Force to take one Effect of any kind into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. OR Deploy a Blockade Flagship site from your Reserve Deck; reshuffle. OR Take one Interrupt with the word &quot;Podracer(s)&quot; in itís game text into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. <br>
<br>
This card provides you with a way to get Podracer Collision, Hit Racer, and any effect you want.  Its a twilek Advisor, but better.  Not to mention, it&#146;s a destiny 5, which is always helpful in podracing decks.  It is certain that the release of this card will increase the amount of dark side podracing we see in tournaments. <br>
<br>
     What else can we expect to see from the dark side?  Well, it seems that Big D has decided to go and bring back good ol&#146; Hunt Down, the objective that won&#146;t die.  They put out honor of the Jedi, we complained, they put out no escape.  They put out Qui Gon, I don&#146;t recall anyone complianing about HD&#146;s death, just about how much dark sucks, so they brought back Hunt Down.  You see, Qui Gon messed up Hunt Down good because he&#146;s a Jedi that there was no way to duel without placing the objective out of play.  So, the objective stayed on the front side while Qui Gon was on the table, which was usually a long time.  Now, with the new effect, They Will Be No Match For You, the light side is in trouble, because hunt down is back.  This effect allows you to deal with Darth maul without placing Hunt Down out of play.  Also, Darth Maul has got the new card Maul strikes which as well as serving as an I have You Now type card, lets you duel an opponents jedi.  So you go out with the new Darth Maul, who adds 1 to each of his duel destinies and duel Qui Gon, flip your objective back and sit back and watch em lose all their force to visage.  They play Transmission Terminated or the combo and there is always Holonet Transmission, This is Some Rescue and more Visages.  One might say, oh well how can you get all this going without activating anything because of Don&#146;t Do that again eliminating the most commonly used Hunt Down strategy.  Never fear, the new card Neimoidian Advisor is a destiny 5 used interrupt that allows you to look through you reserve deck for any battleground.  Thats right, any battleground.  Play a couple of these and a few locations which give you 2 force and you can activate fairly easily, not just with hunt down, but with any dark deck.  Expect this card to replace Mob. Points as the Dark Side&#146;s new way of getting activation.  Neimoidian Advisor should bring back good old mains and toys decks back in a big way.<br>
<br>
     In addition to the resurgance of Hunt Down and Mains we should expect the two new objectives to be very popular.  I&#146;d say however, that My Lord, Is that Legal/I will Make it Legal should be more popular than the other objective because of all of the cool benefits brought to you by senators and political effects.  There is so much taht you can do with this objective that I&#146;m not going to go heavy into detail because I would be writing for hours about every different senator the dark side has, but I will tell you this Tikkes is a senator that belongs in every one of these decks as he provides you with insane activation and suspends honor of the jedi.  Lott Dodd is also insane as he lets you take any one card into your hand from your force pile during each of your control phases.  The political effect, Our Blockade is Perfectly Legal is also genius as it allows you to place senators there to add 3 to any battle destiny just drawn.  With gametexts like these you can make great decks which evolve either around space or ground.  Expect the myriad of things that this objective allows you to do to attract many players.  <br>
<br>
     Well, it&#146;s starting to get late (1:57 AM) and I can&#146;t think of anything else to say about post-coruscant Dark Side so, this is the end.  I hope this proved to be an interesting and informative read for ya.  Please review this with some sense, if you had a problem with it, be specific, if you thought it was good, please tell me what was good about it.  Thanks.<br>
