Consequently, successful Star Wars players fall into one of two categories--those who play fairly well and make great decks, or those that play great and make decks fairly well.  Masters are great at both and we all try to attain this level of mastery.  It isn&#146;t easy!  After all, decks are ONLY 60 cards and there are so many possibilities.  Which ones do you choose?  Then, when tournament-time rolls around, you have to remember all of the &quot;stuff&quot; you put in your deck, and you&#146;ve got to keep mental tabs on everything your opponent does.  Talk about your headaches!  Well, other than investing in an industrial supply of extra-strength aspirin, what can you do?  Hey, I don&#146;t pretend to have all of the answers, but I can say that before you run, you must first learn to walk.  So, I&#146;ll make a deal with you…if you read this rather LONG article, I will try to add something to your Star Wars knowledge pool--something to help your decks get on their feet so that they can eventually run.  It might be that I simply reinforce something you already know and do.  Or better yet, it might be that I make you look at deck-construction in an entirely different light (the result I&#146;m hoping for).  Either way, if you have the patience to read my article, I think you&#146;ll come out a slightly better player and deck-builder in the long run.<br>
<br>
Before we begin building, it&#146;s important to understand that nobody, not even the masters, gets it absolutely right in his very first try.  You will have to tweak and modify.  It&#146;s inevitable.  Your level of experience and skill will determine how close you get in your first iteration.  Don&#146;t be discouraged if your first design is not the 60-card Excalibur that you had envisioned.  If it doesn&#146;t measure up as well as you had hoped initially, you may simply need to evaluate the deck&#146;s strengths and weaknesses and smooth out the rough edges.  Don&#146;t build another deck right away, just because your deck lost a few.  If you do, the cycle will continue.  So what if your LS deck isn&#146;t enjoying the same success as your DS deck.  It&#146;s probably because it hasn&#146;t enjoyed the same kind of shelf life, and therefore hasn&#146;t been tweaked as much.  I suggest that in order to be successful, you should aspire to be more than a deck builder.  Be a Deck Architect.  As an aspiring architect, your first consideration should be whether to build at all.  It might be that your deck just needs a few more supports.  If this is the case, renovate a little and make sure your deck will stand.  However, if your deck has more trouble standing on its own than the Leaning Tower of Piza, chances are that it might be a good time to build a new deck.  If so, keep in mind that successful architects have a series of steps that they take in order to do their best work.  You should follow those same steps as they apply to deck architecture.  The first of these steps is determining whether to build at all.  The remaining steps are listed below…<br>
<br>
SURVEYING<br>
<br>
Architects begin by surveying the landscape on which they will build.  As a deck architect, you should survey the grounds on which you will build your deck.<br>
<br>
*Pick your construction site-Architects do not build if they do not have a site on which to build.  You too must find the site on which you will build your deck.  <br>
<br>
Okay, instead of a physical location, your construction site will be a card or card combo.  In Star Wars circles, we call this your theme.  Sometimes, that them is an objective, but it could also be an effect, character, interrupt, etc.  It could be any number of cards or card types.  Your construction site is whatever card has tickled your imagination to begin thinking about building a deck.  Regardless, create for yourself a vision of what you would like your deck to do in an ideal situation and use that as your starting point.  This will get your creative juices flowing.  Conversely, if you do not pick your site, your deck will fold.  We&#146;ve all seen decks that seemed like 60 cards thrown together randomly with absolutely no direction or strategy, and probably you&#146;ve felt pity for the obvious newbie who was playing it.  They just don&#146;t get it, yet. You must dedicate some time to figure out what your deck concept is--what it is that your deck will do.  This will help determine how you build your deck and it will also help determine how you will combat the elements.<br>
<br>
*Test the grounds--Architects might find a good spot to build, but before they build there, they test the grounds to determine if the location is safe.  You too should test your grounds to see if your construction site is a safe place to build.  <br>
<br>
If your construction site is a card combo, check to make sure the combo is legal.  Check to make sure that you have the cards to pull it off.  Learn any rulings about the cards.  Know what problems you will meet with before you ever begin to design.  This sounds somewhat intensive, but in truth, it&#146;s not.  All you have to know is whether you are capable of accomplishing your vision.  If you want to make a speeder deck using T-47 Battle Formations on Hoth and you include the Main Power Generators, you&#146;ve taken away your battleground sites to satisfy the Formations.  Your deck will crumble because you never surveyed your location.  You destroyed any chance of winning before you ever began to build.  That&#146;s what I mean by testing your grounds.  It simply involves verifying that you will be able to play your deck in tournaments.  So, test your grounds to make sure that you don&#146;t get an unwanted surprise.<br>
<br>
THE WORK ENVIRONMENT<br>
<br>
Once you&#146;ve surveyed the grounds, you&#146;re ready to begin designing.  When Architects are ready to work, they create a productive work environment.  Now that you&#146;re at this stage, you must create an environment conducive to your best work, as well.<br>
<br>
*Go to the office--An Architect has an office--a place where he knows he does his best work.  When it comes time to work, the architect goes to his office.  As a deck architect, you should go to your office, too.  <br>
<br>
It is a documented phenomenon of psychology that our bodies attribute certain functions to certain locations.  For example, your bed is the place where you sleep.  Your body knows this.  That&#146;s why anybody who has ever studied in bed has fallen asleep studying in bed.  So, create for yourself a place where you build decks.  Your body will attribute this as a place of thinking, and you will do your best deck building there.  Your office might be at your coffee table, desk, computer, or any number of other places.  Wherever your office might be, it is important that you have one.  Building decks requires thought, so find a place where you can do your best thinking and make that your office.<br>
<br>
*Adhere to your schedule--Architects never wait until the night before a project is due to throw a building together.  The results would be flawed and unsatisfactory.  As a deck architect, you should adhere to your schedule and give yourself plenty of time to do your best work.  <br>
<br>
Again, deck building requires thought, so you must allow yourself the latitude and time to do your best thinking.  It is very rare that anybody throws 60 cards together 45 minutes before a tournament and actually is successful with the deck.  You must provide yourself ample time to build a deck that you will enjoy playing and that you can be successful with.  Also, try not to build under high amounts of stress.  Your thought process will be stressed as well.  Instead, give yourself hours, days even, to build a deck that you can be proud of and a deck that you will enjoy playing (hopefully, they&#146;re one and the same).  You will do your best work this way, and that will translate into more wins at tournaments and more fun, as well.<br>
<br>
CONSTRUCTION<br>
<br>
When Architects go to their work environments, it&#146;s time to get to work.  Now that you&#146;ve placed yourself in a positive working environment, you&#146;re ready to begin working on your deck.  Here are the Architect&#146;s steps for construction.<br>
<br>
*Blueprints--Architects don&#146;t begin to build if they don&#146;t have a plan.  Why would you?  <br>
<br>
Design your deck on paper before you ever touch your cards.  If you begin working with cards, you tend to be influenced more by individual cards and not how they fit in to the scheme of your deck.  If you begin working on paper, you tend to be influenced more by the big picture and what your deck is trying to accomplish.  Remember that your goal is efficiency.  You&#146;re trying to make the best use of each card slot.  Your LS scouts deck might be more efficient if you had not filled three card slots with Take The Initiative.  While one might be effective, three is overkill and those card slots could be better utilized elsewhere.  Chances are that you&#146;re playing three because you didn&#146;t design on paper first.  However, you don&#146;t realize how those card slots could be more effectively used until the big tournament where your deck gets annihilated by Odds.  Plus, between your three LS games, you only get one chance to use Take The Initiative, and when you did manage to use it, it only added 3 to attrition--not exactly the game-altering result you had hoped for.  If you had begun designing on paper, you probably would have only played one, maybe none at all.  That would have left you with two open card slots, and you might have therefore realized that you were weak against Odds and added Your Insight Serves You Well.  Start with a blueprint before you build.  In a very subtle way, it leads to increased deck efficiency.<br>
<br>
*Lay the foundation--Architects never build without first placing a foundation.  Neither should you.  <br>
<br>
When you are building a deck, you should always ask yourself, &quot;How will my deck win?&quot;  When you were surveying your grounds, you probably discovered a card or card combo that answers this question.  This might be your foundation, but be careful.  Often these cards fit better into the next area of deck construction--framework.  However, if you have identified your deck&#146;s foundation, you can begin deck construction.  A good guideline for preparing your foundation is to allow less than ten card slots.<br>
<br>
No matter what your foundation is, you must begin deck construction by adding the foundation--your means of winning.  It would be a very large oversight to include no TIEs in a TIE swarm deck.  This should be obvious.  Moreover, it should also be obvious that you must apply the proper weight to those same foundation cards to enjoy any amount of success.  A person playing a traditional Hunt Down deck would be mistaken to include only two Vaders in his deck.  He probably has NOT applied the proper weight to his foundation cards.  Neither deck will ever truly be successful because the builder hasn&#146;t adequately prepared the foundation.<br>
<br>
To continue the above argument, I maintain that it is also essential that you recognize what the ACTUAL foundation of your deck is.  I chose the examples of the TIE swarm and Hunt Down decks because, in both examples presented above, I did NOT accurately identify the ACTUAL foundation.  To discover what the actual foundation is, you must answer the question &quot;How will my deck win?&quot; When you have done this, you will have identified what the foundation of your deck is.  Often, it is more than a single card.  For example, while the foundation of a traditional Hunt Down deck would obviously be Vader (you CANNOT win without him), you DO NOT win with Vader.  When you ask yourself,  &quot;How will this deck win?&quot;, your answer is probably &quot;Visage of the Emperor.&quot;  Therefore, there are two elements to Hunt Down&#146;s foundation--Vader and Visage.  This is a solid foundation.  Four or five Vaders plus two or three Visages equals between six and eight cards.  That is within our ten-card limit.  This is stable.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, the card that you chose while surveying is not, as expressed above, your foundation either.  A deck that consists entirely of a TIE swarm would not be much good at all.  In truth, it is the retrieval of Sienar Fleet Systems that gives a TIE swarm deck teeth.  Therefore, the effect, and the locations necessary to make SFS work, are all parts of the foundation.  (Locations are often key parts of the foundation.  You can&#146;t play Scum and Villainy without the Audience Chamber, and you can&#146;t play Tatooine Celebration without Tatooine sites.  Therefore, the appropriate locations for these cards are also part of your deck&#146;s foundation.)  So, in the above example, your TIE swarm foundation consists of Sienar Fleet Systems and Wakeelmui.  Two Sienar Fleet Systems and Wakeelmui equals a three-card foundation.  This is a very stable deck-design and a good example of why small foundations can lead to good decks.  They are easier to play.  TIE swarm decks have limited strategies because they have a small foundation, which means that they are very easy to play.<br>
<br>
In short, to make a successful deck, you MUST identify your foundation and prepare it properly.<br>
<br>
*Build your framework--Architects, never build from the outside in.  They start by assembling the frame.  They erect the supports on which their building will stand.  As a deck architect, you should do the same.  <br>
<br>
The framework of your deck should do a number of things for you.  It should protect your foundation (Holonet Transmission in a Hunt Down deck, Effective Repairs in a WYS deck, or Sense/Alter/Control in any number of decks). It should assist in getting your foundation in place (Geezum, The Signal, or Imperial Command).  It should include a set of additional cards that will carry the weight in your deck--cards that battle, drain, damage, and disrupt (X-Wings, Bounty Hunters, Epic Duel, or Menace Fades).  And it should include a set of supports for your supports--cards that work well with your other framework cards (Den of Thieves, Organized Attack, or Vader&#146;s Obsession).  A good assortment of the above will establish a solid framework, and a solid framework is just as important as a solid foundation.  Without the framework, there is nothing to keep the deck together and your deck will crumble just as quickly as if your deck had no foundation.  A SFS deck without TIEs, even though it has a solid foundation, is even less effective than a TIE deck without SFS.  Therefore, your foundation and framework go hand-in-hand.  Together, they should account for the majority of your deck--approximately forty to forty-five cards out of your sixty.  <br>
<br>
*Add the aesthetic touches--Architects never consider a structure finished when all they have built is supports and struts.  They add windows, masonry, facings, and other aesthetic touches.  As a deck architect, you should add your aesthetic touches as well.<br>
<br>
You have approximately fifteen to twenty cards left.  These are the cards you use to personalize your deck.  These are the interrupts and effects that will make your deck different than the others.  In these fifteen to twenty card slots, you should add both &quot;Universal Cards&quot; and &quot;Tricks of the Trade&quot;.  Your universal cards are cards that fit into almost every deck strategy, but are neither foundation nor framework.  These cards (Imperial/Rebel Barrier, Monnok/Grimtaash, Ghhk/Houjix, Interrupt Grabbers, etc.) are universal in their applicability but are not essential to your deck&#146;s success.  Because these cards are universal in their applicability, it is a good idea to play them because they enhance the effectiveness of your counter-strategies.  Subsequently, you should also add your tricks of the trade--cards that sharpen your deck&#146;s offense and make your deck that much more difficult to beat  (Power Pivot, Lateral Damage, Throw Me Another Charge, and Dark Maneuvers all fall into this category).  The biggest distinction between Universal Cards and Tricks of the Trade is defense versus offense respectively.  Universal cards are universal because they disrupt many opposing strategies.  Tricks of the trade are not universal, because they are specific to that offense (Incidentally, I include Throw Me Another Charge and Dark Maneuvers here, because they are easily tracked destiny 6s.  Used in that capacity, both are highly offensive cards.)  And finally, as you add the aesthetic touches, I suggest that you make one more important consideration--add a surprise or two.  That&#146;s right, if you can add an element of the unexpected, you will be one step closer to beating the great players.  In truth, most successful decks look almost identical to other decks of that archetype.  That&#146;s why one card&#146;s difference here or there makes such an immense difference.  If you can surprise your opponent, you&#146;ll stand a far better chance of beating them.  It is in the aesthetic touches that the real great decks are made.  However, these cards don&#146;t win by themselves.  These are the enhancements that make your framework that much more potent and strong.  Pick these cards with care, because a proper selection of aesthetic touches can make or break your success.<br>
<br>
One quick note on the aesthetic touches:  I suggest building your deck with 63 to 65 cards, initially.  The reason being that there should be a few cards that you want to include in your deck but you have to cut them for deck space limitations.  Keep these cards in mind, because through testing and time, you will find that some of your selections for your original 60 are obsolete.  By keeping these other 3 to 5 cards in mind, you can easily replace the other cards and make your deck more efficient through testing and play.  Also, having these cards in mind will help you to understand your deck&#146;s strengths and limitations.<br>
<br>
Deck construction is a very important part of Star Wars.  With a good foundation, you can compete.  With a good framework, you can win games.  With good aesthetics, you can place in tournaments.  True success, however, revolves around your playing skill.  You need all of the above elements plus good play to win consistently on the tournament scale.<br>
<br>
TESTING<br>
<br>
Architects actually build models before they ever begin building the real thing.  This model allows them to test their designs against the elements to make sure that their designs will stand in less than ideal conditions.  As a deck architect, you must also test your deck.  All of your decks would win if you never had to play an opponent.  The problem is that you do.  Therefore, you have to prepare your decks against the elements--your opponents.<br>
<br>
*Weather Testing--Architects subject their models to common weather conditions to see how well it will endure them.  As a deck architect, you should test your decks against the common conditions, as well.<br>
<br>
The common weather conditions for your decks are the common opposing deck strategies.  You must have a plan to beat them--the Profits, ISBs, EBOs, Hunt Downs, etc.--when you build your deck.  If you do not take these deck types into consideration, your deck is doomed to failure.  Form a strategy to beat the top decks, and adhere to it, adapting, as needs be, to your opponent&#146;s strategy.  Having a cohesive battle plan will make you that much more ready to be successful in tournaments.  So, having prepared to beat these deck types, play your deck against your friends.  They&#146;re probably using common deck types, so you should get a good idea of how your deck will fare against the commonly used decks.  Once, the test results are in, make the proper adjustments and get yourself ready for the tournaments.  <br>
<br>
Remember one more thing about beating commonly used decks: Strategies can substitute cards, but cards cannot substitute strategies.  Your cards don&#146;t beat your opponent…you do.  Just because you&#146;re playing Security Precautions, don&#146;t expect to beat Hidden Base every time.  You must have a strategy.  It might include Security Precautions, but you must have a strategy.  On the other hand, if your strategy beats Hidden Base every time there is no reason to play Security Precautions.  Strategies can substitute cards, but cards cannot substitute strategies.  This is important to remember when preparing to beat any deck type.<br>
<br>
If you do not know what the commonly used deck types are, read the top five light and dark side decks posted on decktech.  These postings always include strategies to beat other popular decks.  Otherwise, you will learn through time and experience what the popular decks to make plans for are.<br>
<br>
Environmental Testing--Architects prepare their buildings against common local environmental conditions.  San Francisco skyscrapers are built earthquake proof, but mountainside homes are not.  On the other hand, mountainside homes are built blizzard proof, but San Francisco skyscrapers are not.  These are two environmental factors common to specific locations.  As deck architects, you should prepare your decks against local environmental factors.  <br>
<br>
In the Star Wars community, we call this the local meta and designing your decks with the proper Star Wars environment in mind is conducive to success.  In my environment, I never saw EBO in my area pre-Tatooine, so I rarely ever played Resistance or Imperial Decree.  However, if I had seen EBO in often, it would have made sense to include a Resistance in my DS decks.  That is your meta.  You include considerations for your environment in your deck designs.  However, the local meta does not just include opposing deck types.  It also includes single cards.  For instance, Order To Engage was common in my area pre-Tatooine, and as a result, I played Point Man in my decks to combat that single card.  In other areas, that annoying single card might be a Landing Claw or Mantellian Savrip.  It could be any number of cards.  Regardless, you should choose your cards accordingly.  That&#146;s meta.  Keep this in mind as you build your decks.  As you play and see certain cards more commonly, put in counters for those cards.  This way, through testing you will prepare your decks for your Star Wars environment.<br>
<br>

Okay, hopefully, your deck is done!<br>
<br>
You should be ready to compete in your next tournament.  Now, you need to stick with your deck.  Remember, most decks become successful because you learn them inside and out and figure out how best to play them over time.  Don&#146;t overreact whenever you lose a game.  I must reiterate that your cards don&#146;t beat your opponent…you do.  In most cases, if you lose, your deck didn&#146;t fail you.  You failed it.  Look deeper and think about what other strategies you could have employed to win.  If there really wasn&#146;t anything at all, then modify a card here or there.  But don&#146;t scrap it until you know that it is antique, outdated, and of no use to you anymore.  Architects don&#146;t build skyscrapers just to tear them down.  As a deck architect, neither should you.<br>
<br>
<br>
**PICKING THE BEST MATERIALS**<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve discussed the steps that you, as a deck architect, should employ in building decks, but one of the other considerations in construction that I have not yet discussed is how to pick the best materials for the job.   While a brick facing would work for certain architectural projects, it might be impractical or too costly for an architect&#146;s goals.  As a result, that architect might use stucco or fiberglass instead.  Architects choose their materials based on what they want to accomplish, taking into account efficiency and cost.  As a deck architect, so should you.<br>
<br>
It has always intrigued me how, in Star Wars, one card can make the difference between a good deck and a great deck.  Yes, every card slot IS that important!  So don&#146;t take liberties with them.  Filling each slot with the cards that will do the most work for you is absolutely essential to a good deck design.<br>
<br>
When selecting your 60 cards, you should ask yourself regarding every card, &quot;What do I hope to accomplish with this card?&quot;  Having answered that question, you should then ask, &quot;Is there another card which can accomplish this task better?&quot;  For example, you pick The Signal as your starting interrupt.  Its purpose is to get Insurrection.  However, you realize that Heading For The Medical Frigate can do the job even better.  It gets Insurrection and 2 additional effects.  It is the better card.  <br>
<br>
I know that this is an elementary example and not a mistake many would make, but it illustrates my point.  If you have a clear understanding of why you are playing a card, not only will that understanding help you in game play, but it will also help you in picking the best card for the job.  Picking the best card for the job leads to more efficient use of your card slots, and more card efficiency leads to better decks.  So, picking the best card is essential to good deck design.  An example of the best-card questions could be the use of Weapon Levitation in a Profit deck.  <br>
<br>
In your Profit deck, you use Weapon Levitation to get Obi-Wan&#146;s, Anakin&#146;s, and Luke&#146;s lightsabers.  Occasionally, you use Weapon Lev&#146;s lost text, but not often.  Gift of the Mentor might be the better card.  You give up a used interrupt for a lost interrupt, but with Profit&#146;s retrieval that&#146;s a non-factor.  You give up the infrequently used lost text, but you gain the option of adding battle destiny when Ben and Luke are together--a better alternate option anyway.  And it still pulls your sabers.  In this situation, Gift is the more versatile card and therefore Gift of the Mentor is the best card for what you&#146;re trying to accomplish.<br>
<br>
In situations where you deal with multiples of the same card, you must look at the second card as an entirely separate card altogether.  For instance, you have Tatooine Celebration, and then you have your second Tatooine Celebration.  Regarding the second, you must again ask yourself the aforementioned questions.  &quot;Why am I playing A SECOND Celebration?&quot;  To make sure that I draw one faster.  &quot;Is there a better card for the job?&quot;  Yes, The Signal allows me to pull effects from my reserve deck.  Perhaps there was a different reason that you were playing two Celebrations.  &quot;Why am I playing a second Celebration?&quot; In case the first one gets cancelled.  &quot;Is there a better card for that job?&quot; Yes, Effective Repairs lets me retrieve effects into hand.  In both cases, there could quite possibly be a better card for the job.  It is often true that there is a better card for the job than a multiple of another card, so you should explore your options closely.  However, if there is a possible substitute card, you must decide if the substitute is the better card in your deck.  Here are a few factors to consider when deciding which is the better card.  <br>
<br>
DESTINY:  Which has the better destiny?  If you&#146;re looking to replace Jedi Luke with a Luke&#146;s Back, think again.  Jedi Luke&#146;s destiny 6 is all the reason you need to play a second of him.  However, if you were replacing farmboy Luke with Luke&#146;s Back, it makes more sense, but you still might want to think hard, simply for the second factor.  <br>
<br>
DIFFERENTIAL:  If your alternate is an interrupt, is it Used or Lost?  If you&#146;re using your alternate to pull the original from your reserve deck, this is an important consideration.  A Used interrupt, such as Were You Looking For Me in place of a second Artoo &amp; Threepio makes sense, because you&#146;re pulling a lower destiny from your reserve and replacing it with a higher destiny and you have the added versatility of Were You Looking For Me&#146;s added destiny text, you give up nothing for this.  All in all, WYLFM is the better card.  However, if the alternate is Lost, than it might be wiser to play a second of the original, because you&#146;re lowering your aiding your opponent in winning.  Also, it might be wiser for the next factor.  <br>
<br>
COSTS:  What are the costs of your alternate card.  A Lost Interrupt which allows you to pull a card for a cost, such as the Back cards, isn&#146;t always the best selection, because it effectively raises the deploy cost of your original, and in the long run, as mentioned before, it lowers your differential.  Often, those costs are too costly…but not always.  If that lost interrupt can do MANY useful things for you, it might be the better card.  Double Back isn&#146;t a bad choice in a Black Sun deck, because you rely on bounty hunters, and it will pull any bounty hunter you want or retrieve them.  Used Interrupts with costs also might not be the best cards for the job.  A Signal used in your deck for the sole purpose of pulling ONE effect doesn&#146;t make sense.  The Signal&#146;s cost of 3 force is restrictive.  However, if you&#146;re playing MANY useful effects, The Signal is a logical choice, despite its costs, simply for its utility.  In one card slot, you have whatever effect you need from your reserve deck.  That card choice makes sense.<br>
<br>
QUANTITY PLAYABLE:  If your card is non-unique, how many can you logically fit into your deck.  While swarms have interrupts to pull the swarming characters, it really only makes sense to play one or two of the appropriate interrupt because with no limitation to the amount of your swarm on the table, you want to get as many out there as you can.  Eight Short Range Fighters and one TIE is just silly, however eight TIES and one Short Range Fighter is good deck design, because the TIE is the more valuable card in your deck, and you can play many of them.  But you don&#146;t play nine TIEs, because you get the added utility of a Used 5 that can retrieve once per game.  By including it, you have added to your deck&#146;s efficiency.  But you can&#146;t deploy interrupts, so you have to determine how many of the original will do your job for you and then work from there.  <br>
<br>
When working with multiples of cards, my suggestion to you is that you begin with only one of any given card in your deck.  Add multiples as you discover that a card is essential to your strategy or as you discover that a card is useful in various situations.  You might play two or three Rebel Barriers, becau </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2517"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2517"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2517" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
