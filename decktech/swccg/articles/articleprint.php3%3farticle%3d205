The minute I say there are basically 2 types of decks in SWCCG, someone will be right there challenging this assumption. They will naturally be correct, from their point of view. I recognize this but choose to classify decks into two types anyway, just to provide a framework for discussion. The two general categories I will use are Balanced and Not Balanced.<br>
<br>
I think most players know the characteristics of a balanced deck and we can throw everything else into the Not Balanced bucket. Just in case, I am going to define my terms a bit:<br>
<br>
Characteristics of a deck that is not balanced:<br>
It generally is confined to one theater of war: space or ground (sometimes even more specifically confined) and it tries to cope with areas of weakness by doing one or more of the following:<br>
1. completely taking the opponent out of his/her game (force choke, for instance)<br>
2. using a few general counters that hope to shut opponent down long enough to gain an advantage (it could be worse, undercover spies, landing claws)<br>
3. causing massive early force loss or using massive force retrieval or both (odds, operatives are examples)<br>
Usually a non-balanced deck has a limited number of ways of dealing damage to the opponent. If the damage dealing methods can be shut down early enough, the deck is almost guaranteed to lose. It often depends on surprise and the damage done being quick and massive. A very large percentage of the cards in the deck are devoted to the primary method of causing damage. ISB drop and drain, Operatives, Asteroid Sanctuary, Spam wings... are some examples of decks that are not balanced. In general, these are the Deck of the Month Club decks. They often exploit a clever idea, a new card, or a recently discovered rules quirk.<br>
<br>
Characteristics of a Balanced deck:<br>
A balanced deck, by definition, is divided somewhat evenly between venues and should have no glaring weaknesses. It is prepared to exploit weaknesses where the opponent does not concentrate and can effectively challenge the opponent even where s/he is strong. A balanced deck can almost always continue to function, even when a particular card or strategy is rendered unusable. A balanced deck should be able to seize the initiative or to react to the opponents strategy, as appropriate. A balanced deck will be prepared to counter most of the popular non-balanced decks. Some strategies will be more challenging than others but a balanced deck should seldom be caught completely flat footed. I would say that the most challenging and fun game for a balanced deck would be against another balanced deck. Balanced decks are very popular on Decktech and have a tendency toward certain similarities. Clint Hayes Hunt Down deck that won the Decktech award for November is a balanced deck. A lot of the test2 decks and non-xwing hidden base decks are somewhat balanced.<br>
<br>
Playing a balanced deck takes more skill than playing a non-balanced deck. I have made fun of the deck postings that say this deck takes a lot of skill to play as being a kind of chest beating attempt to intimidate lesser players. However, I will retract that assertion a bit here. Nothing will bring out an inexperienced player's weaknesses like trying to play a balanced deck.<br>
<br>
Its all about choice:<br>
With a very focussed deck. Your choices are very limited. You have to pretty much play YOUR game YOUR way or lose. Most of the strategy occurs in the deck building. Your deck is a train. It goes very fast in one direction. Very little choice is involved. You keep the up a head of steam and hope no one tears up the tracks. If the train gets de-railed, it goes nowhere. No choice required = no skill required? Well I dont 100% agree but Ill stipulate to: less choice required = less skill required.<br>
<br>
One of the most important features of a balanced deck is that it gives the player as many options as possible. The player should have the maximum flexibility to respond to the largest possible number of situations. Of course more opportunity for choice = more opportunity to make the wrong choice! This is a very important consideration for players who are just beginning to try balanced decks at the tournament level. Dont give up if you have problems at the start. It is easy to make mistakes and sometimes difficult to identify exactly what they were.  Read tournament reports from good players who play balanced decks. It is often amazing to see how they respond to certain strategies with cards that you might never have thought to play in exactly that way. An example would be playing On The Edge to lose during a battle where your lone character is getting crushed. The character is lost and the battle is all over, just like Houjix. This brings me to my next point.<br>
<br>
A complex network of cards<br>
Card choice in a balanced deck is often much more difficult than in a non-balanced deck. In his article on schools, David Akers describes how a player will often agonize over changing one card in his/her deck. This is because, to be an effective balanced deck, the cards must be very well networked. They must work together very well in a variety of combinations. While the deck needs to be able to continue to function if a card is lost, each card is important. Take out a card and it will have a ripple effect. If not, it might not have been a good choice in the first place. Similarly, adding a card will have a ripple effect: a subtle impact on how the other cards in the deck function. You have to look at basic functionality, interaction with other cards, destiny, recyclability, etc.	With a balanced deck, discarding is often an agonizing choice. Since every card is calculated to be useful in a number of circumstances, you will seldom find yourself holding cards that you know you can't use. On the other hand, in a Skrilling Deck you just chuck a couple of Skrillings -- you probably have 15 more anyway.<br>
<br>
Deck building<br>
More than other types of decks, a balanced deck should be very much your own. This is not to say that you can not use a posted deck as a jumping off point. In fact I'd recommend it. However, you must understand and be comfortable with each card choice. In general the deck should have strength and flexibility in space and on the ground.<br>
<br>
The building process should be slow and patient. Get the deck reviewed on decktech. Play the deck and TAKE NOTES after each game. Decide whether your problems were due to misplays or deck construction problems. If the latter, make few changes. Decide whether your successes were due to luck or the strength of the deck. If for instance your balanced Hunt Down deck has only 6 locations in it and you win a game where you drew 3 of them in your opening hand, don't conclude that your deck has no problems with force generation. You were lucky. Play 10 or 11 more games and then you can draw some conclusions about force generation. There is much more to be said about deck building and deck analysis. Check out the many great articles here on Decktech. You will find that most of the methods and principles espoused apply to building balanced decks.<br>
<br>
Play skill<br>
READ THE CARDS -- yours and your opponents. Thinking about deploying to a location and you can't recite both sides of it's gametext or the gametext of any cards deployed there from memory? Read the card(s)!  You should know every function of every card in your deck, all the game text all the stats and characteristics. Read tournament reports. Pay special attention to the game play of good players. Get a feel for what to expect when your opponent is starting certain cards. Especially note any deceptive starts you see or hear about. Often the key to victory with a balanced deck is the ability to quickly assess what your opponent is doing, set up some counters and 'hit 'em where they ain't.' Stick with the balanced deck approach for a while. Make changes from time to time, just so you won't be too predictable. But remember that, with a balanced deck, you are likely to learn more from playing a game than your (non balanced) opponent is.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
