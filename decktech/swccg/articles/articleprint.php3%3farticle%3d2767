It is a great way to get cards you need to complete sets and improve decks. Still, some people fear trading, and most feel they don&#146;t know enough about it to do it well. These tips can help them.<br>
<br>
Trading is the exchange of cards you own for others&#146; cards of similar value. Who determines value? Your best bet is to pick up an accurate, credible price guide. Many people prefer the guide published in each issue of Scrye. You can find this magazine in games and hobby shops, or you can email Scrye at scrye@aol.com. It gives a fairly accurate price listing of each card in three different conditions that cards can be. Low - Torn and scratched, worst conditions. Mid - Ok, usually good. High - Mint condition.<br>
Never played in a tournament. Things played in this ondition usually drop into Mid.<br>
<br>
First step: begin trading with your friends. Or you could go to your local card shop and see if the store owner can introduce you to other card customers who might want to trade. or look around or ask the people in the store who play Star Wars want to trade. You may even want to ask if you can leave your name and a way to contact you. Some shop owners will even accept have/want lists so other players can compare lists whenever they stop in.<br>
<br>
Check out any type of SW:CCG tournament. Even if you&#146;re not ready to play, the players who gather are usually interested in trading. And, they can advise you on which cards you<br>
want to trade for. Arrive early and don&#146;t be shy - Jump right in and ask. You can also find cards online. Many players trade this way, but...let the buyer beware. Most people have encountered some greedy person who claims to own cards and you mail money or your cards and he never mails you back. <br>
<br>
References are a key elements in almost anything. I didn?t find out Decktech myself, JediMandalor told me about it. I looked at what the site was, and then joined. Thanks to<br>
my refrence. A reference is someone with whom you have previously traded who will vouch that you are honest with your trades or who you are trading with. Keep their e-mail<br>
address on file and let them have yours (if you both agree to be a reference for the other). References are used in trade.<br>
<br>
Trading isn?t just about money, some people will trade some high dollar card for some lower value card because eithier they don?t want that card or they want the lower value<br>
card because it?s their favorite character. Others collect more than play, so they?ll trade for the lower value card to have their 5th copy. Others trade more gameplay value. But<br>
beware! It?s best to have a price value nearby when trading so you don?t get ripped of.<br>
<br>
Even with these precautions, there is still a slim chance of being ripped off. It happens. If you want to trade, be careful, and follow the tips I posted, and you&#146;ll improve your chances of a successful trade. That completes Chpater 2. Look foward to Chapter 3.
