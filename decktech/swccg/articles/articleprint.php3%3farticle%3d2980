It should be known that I have never met Brian Hunter in person and this is not meant to be insulting in any way towards Brian. Hopefully, he will be amused by this, as well as anyone else who reads this.  I&#146;d like to add that a small number of you may not be getting the whole idea of this after the first chapter.  Its just a funny story.  I&#146;m not insulting Brian Hunter and I really have nothing against him.  Also, some of you may seem to think I&#146;m just writing some stupid articles here in order to get 5 stars and thus you are going along and giving me 1 or 2.  Look, this isn&#146;t really about getting a high decktech rating or anything.  If you like the story go ahead and give it a good review.  If you don&#146;t like it than read it and tell me what you think is wrong with it and then give me a lower review.  Don&#146;t tell me, &quot;Oh this doesn&#146;t have to do with gameplay&quot;.  It seems that the majority of the people reading it don&#146;t care that it has nothing to do with gameplay (These aren&#146;t my &quot;review cronies&quot; either, i dont know most of them), and this is a story that I feel should be told.  By posting it in the articles section, it is made open to the largest amount of people that can be reached using Decktech.  It&#146;s not going to help you with SWCCG but it&#146;s SWCCG related and it will make you laugh (hopefully).  <br>

Part II: Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#146;t Nuttin ta F*ck Wit<br>
<br>
I made it a priority for myself to find out what room Brian was staying in before I left the convention center.  After a little while of asking around I got the information I needed.<br>
<br>
One quick grande meal at the local T-Bell later and we were on our way back to the hotel.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So what exactly are you trying to find out about Hunter here,&quot;  Tyler asked.   <br>
<br>
It was hard enough for me to concentrate on the road with my mind still focused on the events that had occurred during the tournament.  Tyler&#146;s questioning of my motives wasn&#146;t helping.  I had to pull over befoe I could explain anything to him.<br>
<br>
The car came to a hault at the side of the parkway.<br>
<br>
&quot;In my game against Brian, something happened that I would have to call the single most bizarre thing I&#146;ve ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What, like a 6 ton elephant stormed into the room and took a sh!t on the cards in front of you?&quot;<br>
<br>
At least I could give some kind of reason for that going on.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Tyler, like his eyes began to glow a Satanic red and let out a scream that come to think of it probably would have made me piss myself if I hadn&#146;t been in Nam.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you weren&#146;t even alive when Nam was going on...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhhhh, its ok Tyler.&quot;<br>
<br>
I pulled the car back on to the road and began to drive back to the hotel.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You gotta admit though, he is the shadiest character ever to reveal himself to man,&quot; I offered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and theres the whole backpack thing too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This should be lovely.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea well remember the time we ate all that taco bell and then had your mom&#146;s bean dip afterwards and we were in your room and I kept farting and we thought we might die because of gas poisoning?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well his backpack was giving off a stench that conquered that one.&quot;<br>
  <br>
&quot;Whoa...did you ask him what was in it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.  That&#146;s when he went demonic hellspawn on my ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
We drove along not speaking for a few more minutes until we reached the hotel.  My priorities were as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Pack my bags and prepare for tomorrow&#146;s trip.<br>
2. Find Hunter&#146;s room and get myself in there.<br>
3. Live<br>
<br>
As I was opening the door to our room, Tyler looked up at me as if he had been buried in deep thought for a good while.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Dude...are you sure it smelled worse than that time?&quot;<br>
<br>
....................................................<br>
<br>
My bags were all packed.  Everything was in order.  It was time to see what I could discover about the creature that seemed to occupy my every thought.  <br>
<br>
I walked down the hall to the room where I was told he was staying.  As I approached the room the numbers ascended in an almost tormenting manner.  When would I reach his room?  How many left? 20...19...18...That wasn&#146;t all though.  The closer and closer I got, the more distinctly I could hear some kind of noise, maybe music, coming from a room up ahead.  I couldn&#146;t directly make it out though.<br>
<br>
When I finally reached the room, an arm pulled me in quickly before I could even knock.<br>
<br>
&quot;SO MAN, YOU GOT THE STUFF?!?!?!&quot; demanded a very shady character. <br>
<br>
This was not Brian.  Brian did not shake violently as he spoke.  Brian didn&#146;t look like he was just removed from the back alley behind a crack house.<br>
<br>
No...Brian looked much worse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, I think I&#146;ve got the wrong room...er...Do you know Brian Hunter.?<br>
<br>
&quot;I AM THE KEYMASTER!!!  ARE YOU THE GATEKEEPER!?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummm, yes...&quot;  With that I slid myslef out of the room.  This was just great.  I needed to find Brian but I couldn&#146;t find his room.   That damn music wasn&#146;t helping either.  All I could hear was...<br>
<br>
TIGER STYLE!!!!!!!   TIGER STYLE!!!!!!!!! <br>
Wu Tang Clan aint nuttin to @#$% wit<br>
Wu Tang Clan aint nuttin to @#$% wit<br>
Wu Tang Clan aint nuttin to @#$% wit<br>
<br>
I decided to take a shot at it and knock on the door where the music was coming from.  Maybe it would be Hunter.  Worse case scenario: it&#146;s not Hunter and I&#146;ll kindly ask the guy to turn his stereo down OR it&#146;s not Hunter and when I ask the guy to turn his stereo down he pulls out a MAC 10 and guns me dow where I stand.  <br>
<br>
I hesitantly knocked on the door.  <br>
<br>
I be tossin, enforcin, my style is awesome<br>
I&#146;m causin more Family Feud&#146;s than Richard Dawson<br>
And the survey said -- ya dead<br>
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your @#$%in head<br>
MZA who was that?  Aiyyo, the Wu is back<br>
Makin niggaz go BO BO!, like on Super Cat<br>
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come<br>
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum!<br>
<br>
This is all I hear for a few seconds until the door swings open and it reveals itself once more.  I am mesmerized as I stare at Brian Hunter bouncing about the room as if he was Petey Pablo, swinging a shirt over his head (like a helicoter) rapping along with the Wu-Tang Clan.<br>
<br>
A bit more rapping ensues and I stare in wonder.  The plot thickens as the chorus to the song begins.  Hunter tries to get me to rap along.<br>
<br>
And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus<br>
Wu-Tang Clan ain&#146;t nuttin ta @#$% with<br>
Straight from the mother@#$%ing slums that&#146;s busted<br>
Wu-Tang Clan ain&#146;t nuttin ta @#$% with<br>
<br>
Fearing for my life, I join in.<br>
<br>
WU TANG CLAN AIN&#146;T NUTTIN TA @#$% WITH<br>
WU TANG CLAN AIN&#146;T NUTTIN TA @#$% WITH<br>
  <br>
..................................................<br>
<br>
Once the song ends Brian approaches me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey man, how&#146;s it goin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;uuuuuuh, ok..er...I wanted to know if you wanted to play a quick game of Wars.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nah man, I gotta get some sleep.  I&#146;m leaving early for the long ride home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really, what time?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&#146;Round 6 I&#146;m checking out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes well, it was nice meeting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea you too, Sam.  See ya around.&quot;<br>
<br>
I left the room baffled.  Whether what I just witnessed was the funniest or scariest thing in my life I may never know.  It was probably both.  <br>
<br>
Either way I now knew when Brian was leaving.  The plan was to follow him at a safe distance away so that he wouldn&#146;t catch on.  When we reached his home, I figured, all of my questions would be answered. <br>
<br>
..................................................<br>
<br>
I&#146;m in a fubu jacket with gold chains around my neck and a pimp cain at my side.  Two hoes are ridin&#146; in the back of my fly 73 chevy convertible with the boomin&#146; system and the hydros bouncin&#146;.  <br>
<br>
To my right I see a man covered from head to toe in hair.  All hair.  I reach my arm out to touch his hair and a creature pops out and bites on to my arm.  It grabs hold of me and slowly sucks my entire body into it&#146;s hairy abyss.  <br>
<br>
The image I just described to you is the same one that has haunted my dreams ever since the night before we left for Colorado.<br>
<br>
Indeed, sleep did not come easy that night.  <br>
<br>
<br>
