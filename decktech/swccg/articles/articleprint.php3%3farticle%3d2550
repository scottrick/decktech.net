Here ya go!<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(droid) o 2-1B    1<br>
Power 0 Medical Droid<br>
&quot;Once per turn, one of your non-droid characters lost from same site may go to your Used Pile rather than Lost Pile.  Subtracts 2 from X on your Bacta Tank&quot;<br>
<br>
Alright, I know lots of people used to use this card, but I&#146;ve noticed a severe decline in people that use it.  I think this is probably one of the best cards nowadays, because of the inclusion of Darth Maul.  Place 2-1B with Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight at your Endor Landing Platform in a TIGIH deck, and when Maul comes by to duel, you just send LSJK to your Used Pile instead.  Not bad I&#146;d say.  He&#146;s also useful in tons of situations like Dr Evazan and his friends with sticks.  If they kill them off quickly, send them to your used pile for revenge later on.  Also useful to lower deploy cost on your Bacta Tank, making MANY characters free in the Bacta Tank.  Good job, 2-1B, I salute you!<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(interrupt) Dark Dissension     3<br>
Used OR Lost Interrupt<br>
&quot;Used: Cancel Dark Collaboration or Lone Pilot.<br>
Lost: If two Imperials each with ability &gt;2 are in a battle together, use 2 force to draw two destiny.  Subtract that amount from opponent&#146;s attrition and total power.&quot;<br>
<br>
NOT BAD AT ALL!  This is one of my favorite defensive cards, since there are so many combos of high-ability Imperials (such as Mara Jade, Vader, Emperor, Tarkin, Motti, Tagge, Igar, Veers, etc etc etc... you can figure them out).  Also, this combined with End Of A Reign (from the new Tatooine Expansion), you can cancel Vader&#146;s game text, use Dark Approach to cancel Emperor&#146;s text, then use this card, and kill off both of them to attrition and saber slicing!  Not bad!  I love it.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(droid) o R-3PO     3<br>
Power 1  Protocol Droid<br>
&quot;Once each turn, during your control phase, for each opponent&#146;s spy present opponent much lose 1 force (2 if spy is a droid or is undercover, 4 if both).&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a giant card.  Lots of people use it, but not enough to not warrant this in the article.  There are tons of ISB decks out there nowadays.  Especially those that use 5D6-RA7.  Well, deploy R-3PO to his location and he&#146;s gonna have to lose 2 force a turn or get him away!  If he moves away, you can just use Nabrun Leids and follow him or something.  Also useful against U-3PO, Arica, and the many, many other spies in many decks (Merrejk comes to mind), it&#146;s just a must-have in decks nowadays.  Free force loss is cool.  And, he can&#146;t be battled, which is incredible.  DEATH TO SPIES!<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(rebel) o Cal Alder      2<br>
Power 2  Ability 1<br>
&quot;Power +1 at Defensive Perimeter.  Your vehicles move for free if moving toward same site as Cal.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is also a giant card in most scout decks.  Just throw in some Speeder Bikes or Sand/Snowspeeders and react away, for FREE!  How cool is that?  He&#146;s a scout and can be pulled by Crix Madine, and with Speeder Bikes being machines in some TIGIH decks, this is just too cool.  Try it out, it&#146;s effective (also, check out my deck TIGIH Speeder Bike Patrol, it has it in it).<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(interrupt) Fall Back!    5<br>
Lost Interrupt<br>
&quot;If opponent just initiated a battle at an exterior site with more than double your total power, use 1 force to cancel the battle and move all your characters there to an adjacent site (for free) where the opponent has no presence.&quot;<br>
<br>
This card is cool nowadays.  With 3 Jedi, the opponent has some massive power.  And keep in mind, this is NOT a react, so cards that cancel reacts alone will not affect it (I know Sense can still just cancel the interrupt), so that&#146;s cool too.  You can just leave a few scrubs at an Endor site, try playing this.  If they cancel it, then use Dash and/or Hidden Forest Trail&#146;s text to get your scouts over there.  It&#146;s not as useful as some cards I guess, but it&#146;s not to be overlooked.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(effect) Frostbite       4<br>
Effect<br>
&quot;Deploy on Hoth system.  At the end of each player&#146;s turn, for every character that player has present at a marker site under &#146;nighttime conditions&#146;, that player must lose 1 force (2 if character is missing).&quot;<br>
<br>
Good card, I would say (and I wrote the strategy on Decipher&#146;s web site many years ago, and it&#146;s still there!  Check it out - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/hoth/light/small/frostbite.html - (I&#146;m proud of it).  I was like 10-11 or something when I wrote that.  That explains a lot, but it&#146;s useful anyways.  Deploy Defensive Perimeter and Snow Trench, and start draining!  If the opponent wants to come down, that&#146;s cool, just hit him with the Nightfall/Ice Storm/Frostbite combo.  It&#146;s an absolute game winner right there.  Make sure to Rebel Barrier his characters first, to maximize the effect.  Have fun with this one!  (also, you can use Hoth Survival Gear to help out a little bit).<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(interrupt)  Perimeter Scan   4<br>
Used Interrupt<br>
&quot;Use 1 force to peek at any one card which is face down at a location.  OR Use 1 force to peek at opponent&#146;s hand.  You may move each droid spy and Infantry Mine you find there in opponent&#146;s Used Pile.  OR Cancel Probe Telemetry.&quot;<br>
<br>
This card is good on 1 level - looking at his hand.  Maybe it&#146;s just me, but this is an absolutely GIGANTIC benefit to have in this game.  With so many cards out to cancel Scanning Crew, but none (that I know of) to cancel Perimeter Scan, this is the better of the two.  It also has higher destiny.  Neat!  Also, it can get 5D6-RA7, U-3PO, Probe Droids, and the very rare mines down into their used pile.  This is giant, since 5D6 and U-3PO will wreck some ground draining decks.  But again, the biggest park is just looking at their hand.  No characters?  Spread and drain!  No Tallon Roll/Relentless Pursuit?  KILL HIS TIES!  Useful in every situation.  I love this card.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(rebel) o Romas &quot;Lock&quot; Nevander   3<br>
Power 1 Ability 3<br>
&quot;Adds 1 to power and manuever of anything he pilots.  Opponent may not &#146;react&#146; to or from same location.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, for one, he absolutely wrecks Speeder Bike on ROPs/Endor decks.  If those are popular, by all means use this guy.  Also, if DSII decks are popular, this guy can help out inside the DSII&#146;s interior if needed.  Or in the asteroids, either one.  His react-cancelling ability is just gigantic in many cases, so I like this guy.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(effect) o Tauntaun Bones    3<br>
Effect<br>
&quot;Use 1 force to deploy on table.  Each opponent&#146;s destiny draw, you do the following: 0=Put top used card in hand; 1=lose 1 force; 2=activate 1 force; 3=lose this Effect; 4=retrieve 1 force; 5=deploy a character for free; 6+=nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
I used to play this card all the time when I didn&#146;t have many cards to play, and it was especially a fun card!  It&#146;s a gamble, but with many high-destiny decks nowadays (Hunt Down Podracing comes to mind), this is definetely worth it.  There are only 2 negative parts in this card, the &#146;1&#146; and &#146;3&#146; part.  The &#146;3&#146; part can only happen once, so that&#146;s cool.  The &#146;1&#146; part can happen many times, but if it does, that means the opponent has really crappy destiny!  That&#146;s cool too.  Many people like to have high destiny, like 4-5&#146;s, so that means you retrieve force and deploy big characters (LSJK, Qui-Gon...) for free!  Not bad at all I would say.  And with Podracing, that&#146;s a lot of destiny drawing (do you add the 3, THEN look at the card, or look at the base destiny for Sebulba&#146;s Pod?).  Not a bad card, a little risky, but it&#146;s FUN!<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
(interrupt)  Under Attack     6<br>
Used Interrupt<br>
&quot;During your control phase, target a vehicle with armor present with your warrior.  Draw destiny.   If warrior has a Concussion Grenade or Lightsaber, add 3 to destiny draw (7 if both).  Vehicle (and grenade) lost if total destiny &gt; armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hey, not bad at all!  It&#146;s a destiny 6 USED Interrupt, so that&#146;s always a good thing.  With Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout in play nowadays, AT-AT killing is super-easy!  And sine he starts with his stick in TIGIH decks, that means this card is even more useful!  AND, with the increase in YMSYL decks, it&#146;s even MORE useful!  That&#146;s one useful card!  And, it can be used more than once in a control phase if needed.  Track your destinies or just have a good destiny deck, and you will rock those Chicken Walkers and big brutes of AT-ATs.  Nice, nice, NICE card.  I use it a lot.  Do you?  Very useful in EBO decks also, because YMSYL = death to those, so now you have a fighting chance!  DEATH TO AT-ATS!  Qui-Gon likes to rip them apart.<br>
<br>

<br>
Well, I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did writing it.  I hope some of those cards will be seen more often now, so people will counter them!  Or maybe not?  Dunno, but I like seeing old cards seeing more action.  Kickin @#$% and chewin&#146; bubble gum!  Thanks for reading/reviewing!  What can I do better in the next one?<br>
