<br>
This card is devastating.  I&#146;d make a deck around them, but I don&#146;t have any.  This combo might seem obvious, but deploy tons of characters for a beatdown including Janse and this rifle.  Also deploy Order To Engage.  Now, the opponent will lose a lot of characters from the beatdown.  Now the opponent will try to run next turn unless they are stupid.  Now, use Sorry About The Mess on your turn with this rifle with a good tracked destiny, then send that interrupt to your used pile and kill the character at the adjacent site.  Not bad.  It&#146;s more fun that effective :-P<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Blastech E-11B Blaster Rifle - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/blasteche11bblaster.html<br>
<br>
This is better than the above-mentioned rifle.  Here&#146;s a really nasty combo some of you might (probably) know about.  Deploy this rifle and Mercenary Armor on Corporal Midge with no Ewoks at that site.  You now add 2 to each of your weapon destinies (if in a scout swarm).  Not bad.  Now initiate a battle, and shoot all of their characters for FREE!  Ahahaha.  It&#146;s nice.  Also useful with Sorry About The Mess.  Combined with Crack Shot, this is nice (if you can&#146;t hit a character or something).<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Covert Landing - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/covertlanding.html<br>
<br>
The first part of this card is a little stupid.  However, the second part is absolutely incredible.  Even if it could be used to deploy 1 character (ahem Jedi Knight Luke) it&#146;s still worth it.  Deploy one of the Golds with Squassin and then land it, then deploy LSJK from reserve!  I think it&#146;s worth it.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Long pause here because I can&#146;t find another good card... :::Jeopardy theme:::<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Rapid Deployment - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/images/rapiddeployment.gif<br>
<br>
This card is NICE.  Sure, not many light decks use troopers, but this card would definetely help them and actually make them useful.  Dirt-cheap troopers from reserve deck?  Not bad I&#146;d say.  Also, just play Rebel Ambush, Commando Training (which I did not discuss because it&#146;s stupid for the most part :-P), or anything that helps those troopers.  For 5 deploy, you can get 15 power w/ Rebel Ambush and Endor Troopers.  I think that is insane, especially from reserve deck.  And any other characters that were there before you played this... ouch.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sound The Attack - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/soundtheattack.html<br>
<br>
Yea, yea go ahead and laugh.  I&#146;m desperate for cards.  But really, this card makes Ewok decks viable.  Adding battle destiny is always NICE, and the ability to recycle this destiny 5 interrupt is nice when you can go look for that 1 Ewok card you need.  If I bought more Endor I would make an Ewok deck...<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Surprise Counter Assault - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/large/surprisecounterassault.html<br>
<br>
Another card to kick-start Ewok decks.  This card allows you to get out all your little monsters FAST and ULTRA-CHEAP (free) if they decide to invade your space (or just drain at their own sites).  Ewoks are fun.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Were You Looking For Me? - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/wereyoulookingforme.html<br>
<br>
This card has become our new SWCCG God.  Ok, maybe not THIS card, but Naked Threepio is.  And this card is the perfect addition to any Threepio deck.  Retrieve Threepio if they play Look Sir, Droids!  Or pull out Artoo &amp; Threepio, Threepio... yea those 2.  Also neat when you play this in an Ewok/Naked or Endor Threepio deck.  But mainly just to retrieve him...<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wicket - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/wicket.html<br>
<br>
This guy is just awesome.  Sure, he is an Ewok that will hurt Midge&#146;s drains, but he&#146;s too good.  He&#146;s a scout of ability 2, which can be pulled with Crix.  His best ability <br>
is when fighting droids, and using I Have A Bad Feeling About This.  Exclude Guri with a destiny 1, shoot Xizor, whatever you want.  But this guy can exclude EVERYTHING with a good destiny.  Playing with some 7&#146;s?  Track one and exclude even Vader.  I&#146;ve done it (in my mind...) and it&#146;s humiliating and really fun.  Nothing beats that.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wokling - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/wokling.html<br>
<br>
Again, perfect in Ewok decks.  Are you draining for a lot at a location?  Play this and dare the opponent to attack you.  This makes all your Ewoks power and forfeit +1, which is nice.  So basically all your power = 0 Ewoks on Endor with this are now power = 3 at the typical Endor site.  That is NICE.  They&#146;re better than the normal Rebel scout!<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wookie Guide - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/endor/light/small/wookieeguide.html<br>
<br>
This card is wicked in RST decks.  For example, put Solomahal on Obi-Wan with Lightsaber.  Now he is immune to attrition &lt;4.  Now the opponent battles elsewhere, and you play this card.  Then play Dash and run him 2 sites away to the battle!  It&#146;s a surprise and it definetely hurts them.  Bad.  Also, since Han and Chewie are always together in such decks, just play this and reduce attrition.  Or just let someone catch up to your guys, whatever.  The Dash combo is nasty though.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There you go.  I hope you liked this one.  Some of those cards are pretty obvious, sorry, but I can&#146;t find others that easily.  Thanks for reading and reviewing.<br>
