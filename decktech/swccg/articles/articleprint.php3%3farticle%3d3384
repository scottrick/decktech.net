<br>
The first set is called Premier and will be based off cards from the Premier Set.<br>
<br>
To use a Virtual Card, you must download the PDF file, print out the cards text, lore, power, ability, etc., and place them overtop of the card with the same title, then place the card in an opague sleeve.<br>
<br>
For example, to play the Virtual Darth Vader card, you must print and place the appropriate information overtop of the Darth Vader card from Premier, NO, not the Vader 2-Player card, IT MUST BE THE SAME CARD TITLE.<br>
<br>
This, of course leads me into my Cons list. <br>
<br>
What if you don&#146;t have a Darth Vader? BUT, you really wanna play with the new Darth Vader card. Your SOL and theres nothing you can do about it until you get a Darth Vader card.<br>
<br>
The reason this is a problem is, because the Virtual Cards are suppose to ADD new cards without us having a requriement to be forced to go out and actually continue to buy cards.<br>
<br>
I am not going to get into the full debate here, because, on the Official Decipher Mailing List {commonlly cards the Listserv}, there has been about a hundred e-mails pertaining to this.<br>
<br>
But, the basic jist of that whole debate was that MANY, MANY people are mad at the Player&#146;s Committee for chosing some RARES to use for the new Virtual Cards. The other MAIN to be made is Luke Skywalker from Premier.<br>
<br>
What are some of the other Cons to having Virtual Cards? <br>
  Well, for the main part, these are considered TOURNAMENT LEGAL two weeks after their release and will be recognized as real cards for tournament play. Thus meaning, you could show up at GenCon and see TONS of Virtual Cards floating around. Not really a fun thing.<br>
<br>
This also hinders people without Internet Capabilities. We discussed this on the listserv as well, their argument is that ANYONE can get to a PC and use the &#146;net. But, in all honesty, this isn&#146;t always true. And they shouldn&#146;t assume this. <br>
<br>
&quot;Assumption which leads to false choice, leads to numerous errors.&quot; -Abe Lincoln<br>
<br>
Currently, we only know of a few cards of this soon to be released Virtual Card set. Which are:<br>
<br>
LS:<br>
Fusion Generator Supply Tanks (V) <br>
<br>
Deploy on a docking bay or your capital starship. Your unique (*) starships are power, maneuver, and hyperspeed + 1. May place this card in Lost Pile to cancel Lateral Damage. Place in Used Pile if opponent controls this location. <br>
<br>
LS:<br>
BoShek (V) <br>
<br>
Deploys &amp;#8211;2 to any docking bay, starship or Cantina. Adds 3 to the power of anything he pilots. Considered &amp;#8216;matching pilot&amp;#8217; for any starship. Once per turn, may take a device into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Immune to attrition &lt; 3. <br>
<br>
LS:<br>
Han&#146;s Heavy Blaster Pistol<br>
-- No Definite Info on this yet. But Downloadble from Reserve Deck. And may cause opponent to lose force when played. --<br>
<br>
DS:<br>
Black 2 (V) <br>
<br>
May add 1 pilot. During your deploy phase, may take one starship weapon or Pride Of The Empire into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Organized Attack and All Wings Report In may not be played. Immune to attrition &lt; 5 while piloted by DS-61-2. <br>
<br>
DS: <br>
Darth Vader (V)<br>
<br>
Adds 4 to power of anything he pilots. While aboard a starship, it is immune to attrition &lt; 4. Once per battle at same system (twice if with a Black Squadron pilot) may subtract 3 from a just drawn destiny. Immune to attrition &lt; 5. <br>
<br>
<br>
These are the cards that have been supplied so far.<br>
<br>
Now, lets move onto the Pros.<br>
<br>
Of course having new cards means No Stale Metagame. Which is always a PLUS. This allows us to continue to move along and progress. Also, we won&#146;t see any new Objectives until Special Edition. Next, they&#146;ll go to A New Hope, then Hoth, then Dagobah, then Cloud City, then Jabba&#146;s Palace, then Special Edition, then Endor, then Death Star II. <br>
<br>
I do not know if they plan to do anything about the botique products.<br>
<br>
Now, onto this Author&#146;s opinions....<br>
<br>
<br>
My opinion is this: Darth Vader is stupid. <br>
<br>
We don&#146;t need more power escalation in the game. Basically, Virtual Cards = Dream Cards with Power to be used in tournaments. This equals pure sh1t. Who wants to see a new Darth Vader compared to making Send a Detachment Down playable?<br>
<br>
What the PC {Player&#146;s Committee} should spend there time doing is making cards like Takeel, all the effects that turn characters into spies, smugglers, etc., into better cards.<br>
<br>
Who wants to be able to ACTUALLY play Juri Juice and maybe win a game because of it? I do.<br>
<br>
Who wants to see a new Vader? I don&#146;t.<br>
<br>
So, if any Player&#146;s Committee representive, designer, etc. sees this, please take my heed and do not power escalate the game. We don&#146;t need to drive away the people in drove&#146;s from tournaments. Sure, we can still play the game in our basement against our dog or best friend, but its also fun to play in tournaments and kick people&#146;s asses. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps. Please reveiew with your feedback about Virtual Cards. <br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
