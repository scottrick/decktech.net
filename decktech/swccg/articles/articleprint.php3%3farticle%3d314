That does not always mean the deck is bad. You should consider whether you are even qualified to rate a deck or article before you submit your opinion.  Decktech is intended to pull the knowledge of the best players in the world together to obtain a databank that rates decks accurately.  Here are some criteria that you should use to determine whether you are qualified to rate a deck:<br>
<br>
1) If there is more than a 400 point difference in Decipher rating between you and the player whose deck you are reviewing, then you are probably unqualified to review the deck.  There are World-class players who are members and they will not be helped very often by incompetent comments made by beginners.  They are looking to improve their decks, and the only way that will happen is if weaknesses are demonstrated by other world-class players.<br>
<br>
2) If you pass the first test, then consider whether you have either built, played with, or played against a good deck that is based upon the underlying concepts of the deck you are reviewing.  For example, if you have never built, played with, or played against a good Hunt Down deck, then please don't rate it.  You are probably not qualified to review the deck.<br>
<br>
3) If you have passed both of the first two tests, then look at the card list.	How many cards in the card list are you unfamiliar with?  If there are more than 5 cards that you are unfamiliar with, then you are probably unqualified to review the deck.<br>
<br>
4) Can you locate the key components of the deck?  What are the major combinations?  What are the key strategies?  If you cannot answer these questions, then you are probably unqualified to rate the deck.<br>
<br>
If you have passed these 4 tests, then you are ready to start looking for weaknesses the deck has.  I cannot emphasize enough that even though you may not see any weaknesses in a deck, that does not mean they do not exist.	World-class players will almost always find a weakness in every deck, and that is why there are no 5 star decks on this list.  When you decide to rate a deck, then please consider the deck carefully.  Steve Sochalski has written a great article about reviewing decks and if you haven't read it, then you need to! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
