But, This is what his review said,&quot;-1 star for posting this to the Decipher BBS<br>
		   -1 star because pencils are better<br>
<br>
		   Ok deck.. for a better version, go here:<br>

Well, the link to his &quot;better deck&quot; was really a  link to a program that bombs your computer making all your programs crash.<br>
I checked out the link thinking I was going to see a cool deck and instead I lose valuable information, on my computer.<br>
I figured I should post this as a service to theres not to go to his links.  I&#146;ll probably get low reviews for this(I&#146;m sure he&#146;ll review it low:)) but I figured if he can be stoped/shamed it&#146;s a good thing.  Beware of &quot;Me_Myself_and I&quot;<br>
Also just so I don&#146;t get low ratings for not posting anything about SWCCG, here&#146;s some hidden tech for you,  Vader and Tarkin together can cancel a destiny in a battle! this is huge:)..Well thats all for now.<br>
Peace be with you...except for &quot;me_myself_and _i&quot;  I actually hope that the bugs in his bed bite extra=extremely hard tonight...extra hard! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
