There&#146;s really no other way to say it.  I started playing Star Wars CCG competitively in 2000.  That was the year Yannick took second at Deciphercon.  Since then, I have at some point played every deck that he has posted on decktech.  He is responsible for some of the most unusual and creative decks to ever hit Star Wars CCG, and to top it off he is one of the top players in the world.  At the time of this article, Yannick is rated 2052 and is ranked the number forty-one player in the world.<br>
<br>
Yannick has been playing since the day the game was first released, and he has dominated the competition ever since.  He recently retired from the game, but before he left I had a chance to ask him about his long and distinguished Star Wars career.<br>
<br>
JT: Your playing style is a lot different from most other people.  Why has the style been so successful for you?<br>
YL: Most of the time people think my decks are unusual, but they don&#146;t see the game the same was as I do.  You have to think outside the box.  There are so many ways to play this game.  People expect a type of play style, but when they play me, they don&#146;t understand what I am doing.<br>
<br>
JT: You are famous for using Mind What You Have Learned and Bring Him Before Me as platforms for your decks.  Why do these objectives work best for you?<br>
YL: MWYHL was a meta choice when DS was dominating the format.  At this time I had about five different decks with the MWYHL platform.  BHBM was just too good after Death Star 2.  I would really love to kick Brian Hunter with BHBM (he always said that BHBM was an auto-win).  After a lot analysis, BHBM was a better platform than Hunt Down, but Decipher decided to slow it a little.<br>
<br>
JT: You have said that you are usually responsible for the decks played not only by yourself, but also by the rest of the Quebec team.  Where do your deck ideas come from?<br>
YL: I love to build decks (my favorite thing about CCG) and when I was really into Star Wars and a set was coming out, I was building everything possible, and every week I was building four different decks.  I was doing this until I ran out of ideas.  I always kept my deck list in my head and when somebody was thinking about building a certain kind of deck, I was offering my version (I always had a version for every deck) and most of the time people were playing my deck.  This is the same thing for Lord of the Rings.<br>
<br>
JT: How big a part of the game do you think tracking is, and how often do you track?<br>
YL: Star Wars is 50% skill, 10% luck and 40% deck building.  If you are a lucky guy most of the time, tracking will not make a big difference, but in a game where both players have a lot of skill, the luck factor will have a huge impact.  That&#146;s why if you&#146;re unlucky, you need to track to make your game easier.  I track when I know the game will be tough or when I have a deck that needs to be tracked.<br>
<br>
JT: What do you think is the state of the game now, and why did you decide to retire from Star Wars?<br>
YL: The game is dead for competitive players; Star Wars is now a casual game.  I was tired of Decipher trying to kill every strategy other than mains and toys, and the fact that Decipher is cheap.  People always complain about Wizards of the Coast being an evil company; Wizards is really cool with their players, great prize support, great prices for pros and they do a great job with cards.  They make mistakes, sure, but who doesn&#146;t?  At least they learn from their mistakes.  I always played Magic, but never put the effort into it.  Star Wars was taking a lot of time and was my personal favorite.<br>
<br>
JT: Even after you had quit the game and sold most of your cards, you still borrowed decks to compete in Freedomcon.  Why?<br>
YL: Why not?  Worlds is great, you can play against the best, make friends with people from other countries and learn cool stuff from different cultures.  I have made a lot of friends around the world and this last competition was my final chance to talk to them for real.  Plus, the price was really good.  Thanks again, Wizards of the Coast.<br>
<br>
JT: You have been one of the most successful Star Wars players ever.  What do you think is your greatest accomplishment as a player?<br>
YL: My 2000 year: second place at worlds, first place at Gencon, fifth place at Origins.  Missing winning worlds two years in a row was my biggest disappointment.<br>
<br>
JT: What do you think is the most valuable skill a player can have?<br>
YL: Adjust to any situation.  When you don&#146;t know what to do you&#146;re in trouble.  Find the good cards after reading it for the first time when a set comes out.<br>
<br>
JT: What would you suggest to someone who wants to improve their game?<br>
YL: The best and easiest way is to play with players better than you.  But when you are alone, like I was in the beginning, you need to read stuff on the net, deck lists, TRs . . . but don&#146;t read articles from newbies or unknown players, most of the time it&#146;s bad advice.  There are some players who are not in their element; whatever they do they will always suck.<br>
