Warning: This article is probably going to be redundant and useless to advanced players. It is to help out those who want to break out of &quot;scrub&quot; status and advance to a higher level of play.<br>
<br>
So tracking is an advanced form of playing; we all know that. Advanced and experienced players use it to make sure they&#146;re going to hit Vader or choke Jedi Luke just for the fun of it. Tracking can win a game if done right, and it is a major advantage for those who know how to utilize its power. Some really good players can even track the cards in your deck as well as their own, thus knowing the outcome of a battle several turns before it happens. I track the cards in my deck, and I&#146;m happy to relate some of my secrets to you in the hope of helping out others who want to advance to a whole new level of strategic planning.<br>
<br>
WHAT IS TRACKING?<br>
Tracking is the term used when you know where a specific card is in your deck. You might happen to know that a Twilek Advisor (pull any effect from your deck, used, not immune to sense, destiny 5) is card number 12 in your deck of 35 cards currently. You know what card is where, and you have the ability to make it card #1 when it&#146;s time to draw battle destiny. This is the simple definition of tracking. You can track a single card in your deck (or any other piles), or you can track several cards. For the sake of this article, I&#146;m going to focus on tracking a single card.<br>
<br>
HOW DO I TRACK MY CARDS?<br>
First off, don&#146;t think that this is a skill that only really high-level players can use. It&#146;s really not hard to do; the often spectacular outcome makes it seem difficult to pull off. Don&#146;t worry about the length of this article - I&#146;m just trying to give you enough detail to be able to see everything in your head. Usually, all you have to do is have the ability to count to 15. For those of you in Florida, I&#146;m sorry if you&#146;re having trouble. JUST KIDDING - THIS WAS A JOKE. Please don&#146;t take offense if you&#146;re reading this in Florida! Everyone else is taking their shots... I&#146;m just jumping on a political bandwagon!<br>
<br>
THE BOTTOM-UP THEORY<br>
Anyway! For beginners, I highly recommend tracking your cards from the bottom of the deck. This is how I started learning to track; it&#146;s probably the easiest way to track your cards, and it works just as well as anything else. Let&#146;s use that Twilek Advisor example above. All we care about is the destiny 5.<br>
<br>
* Activate your Force.<br>
* Use 6 Force to deploy your Vader. You have 6 cards in your Used Pile.<br>
* Use 3 to use a Twilek. Search for any effect - you don&#146;t care which one because you&#146;re only doing it to track. Pull the lowest-destiny effect you&#146;ve got out of the deck.<br>
* You now have 10 cards in your Used Pile - the bottom 6 are from Vader, the next 3 are from Twilek, and the top card is Twilek. It is card #10 from the bottom.<br>
<br>
You can now battle, use weapons, draw destinies, or anything else you want to do. Let&#146;s pretend Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith (you just deployed) is in a battle against Jedi Luke.<br>
<br>
* Draw a destiny to choke Luke. You are obviously going to miss - you want less cards on top of the deck. You now have 1 card in your Used Pile.<br>
* Draw a battle destiny. You beat Luke by 2 power, and his destiny isn&#146;t enough to kill you. Vader lives.<br>
* You now have 2 cards in your Used Pile - the choke destiny, and the battle destiny. You don&#146;t care what those numbers are just yet.<br>
* Recirculate at the end of his turn - Twilek was #10 from the bottom, and now you&#146;ve added 2 cards. It&#146;s now #12.<br>
<br>
Activate all of your Force EXCEPT 12 cards. Deploy your Grand Moff Tarkin against Luke and battle. Draw a destiny of 5 and have Tarkin cancel his destiny. That gives you a power of 15 (6 for Vader, 4 for Tarkin, 5 Destiny) against his power of 6. Sucks to be Luke!<br>
<br>
By counting your destinies from the bottom of your deck, you don&#146;t have to worry about counting what you activate, draw, lose to Force drains, or anything else like that. Just count your Used Pile each turn and keep a single number in your head.<br>
<br>
TAKE A STEP FORWARD<br>
Remember that battle destiny Vader drew against Luke in the first battle? If it was high, keep that number in mind and remember that it is card #2 in your deck now. Card #1 is the choke destiny; card #2 is the battle destiny. Keep the higher destiny in mind and track it through. Were they both high destinies? Activate Force up to those 2 cards and start a battle. Now you can choke someone AND draw a decent destiny. If you realize too late that you&#146;ve activated to the wrong spot in your deck, choke someone just to burn a card. Use an Alter.<br>
<br>
REFERENCES<br>
When you&#146;re starting to learn how to track, R2-Q2 is an awesome reference. This Dark Side droid lets you look at the top 3 cards of your deck during your draw phase, so you can make sure your numbers are what you think they are. Is an Epic Duel the only way for you to win your game? Use R2-Q2 to make sure you can win.<br>
<br>
Janus Greejatus is also a nifty card. He lets you use a Force to put a card from your hand on the bottom of your Used Pile and draw a card from your deck. I always use him to put a destiny 6 card back in the deck (generally a Lost Interrupt), then activate everything except 1 card. Guess what - it&#146;s a 6!<br>
<br>
Reactor Terminal is the most obvious way to track destinies. You can put any destinies you want from your hand into your deck in any order that you see fit. This makes it really easy to keep track of your cards. Lose count? Use the Reactor Terminal again next turn to start over again.<br>
<br>
ADVANCED STRATEGIES<br>
Let&#146;s say you&#146;ve tracked a destiny 6 card to the bottom of your deck. Great! Now activate all your Force except 1 (the 6 is on the bottom of your deck, so now it&#146;s the only one left). Deploy whatever you want and battle. Draw the 6 for destiny, and DON&#146;T MOVE ANYBODY for the rest of the turn. It was the last card in the deck, and now it&#146;s on the top of your Used Pile. When you recirculate at the end of your turn, it&#146;s still the top card! Lose Force from your Force Pile or your hand to keep the 6 on top. If and when they come to battle, you&#146;ll have another great destiny for them.<br>
<br>
Let&#146;s take that same example again. You drew the 6 for destiny and killed everyone at the site. Here is a sample table now: General Solo and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk control the Endor Docking Bay (1 Light icon, 1 Dark icon), and Obi-Wan Kenobi with Obi-Wan&#146;s Lightaber and an elom control the Tatooine Docking Bay (1 Light icon, 1 Dark icon). Your Lord Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin are at the Cloud City Docking Bay. You are going to be Force drained for 2 at the Tatooine Docking Bay and 1 at the Endor Docking Bay. Use 1 Force for Docking Bay Transit from Cloud City to Tatooine. This blocks the drain at Tattoine, leaving you with a drain of 1 to deal with. Your tracked destiny 6 is the #2 card now. Recirculate. When your opponent drains you for 1, lose the top card of your Reserve Deck. Now the destiny 6 card is on the top of your deck again! The battle will get rid of Obi, the Elom, and Tarkin, leaving Lord Vader to control the Docking Bay.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
This was just a simple tutorial on tracking. You can count the cards on the bottom of your deck to track your destinies. Just remember - it&#146;s not as hard as you think! Remember that if you pull cards out of your deck, you will have to reshuffle, and your tracking will be gone. Don&#146;t worry about it - there are still high destinies in your deck, but now you need a little luck to find the right one instead of knowing where it is. If you lose count (and it WILL happen - it happens to the best of us), just find a place to start over again. Don&#146;t get frustrated. I&#146;ve had games where I&#146;ve used a Weapon Levitation (destiny 4) on turn 1 and tracked it the rest of the game, but I&#146;ve also miscounted several times. It&#146;s okay. If you get frustrated with your counting, your playing will suffer. Don&#146;t worry about it! Like everything else, it takes a TON of practice to get it right. Good luck! I hope this helps you out. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
