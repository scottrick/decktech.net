First off I would like to say that I think Tatooine has been great. It has introduced many new strategies and even brought back a of old school cards. <br>
First off Tatooine has introduced cards to stop the abusive tactics of using docking bays for insane activation. In the pre Tatooine environment every deck started Heading for the Medical along with Insurrection and Staging Areas (and vice versa for dark). This left you with one more optional effect that varied on your deck*s strategy. Fallen Portal was another card that was heavily abused since the whole game would revolve around docking bays. Decks that set up shop slowly would have you chance against the kind of speed decks that docking bays allowed. Hence almost every competitive deck would use docking bays. <br>
Another strategy that was abused was non-unique aliens using the MKOS platform. These nobodies from Jabba*s underworld were just getting to powerful and beginning to decrees game play (like the operatives of old). To counter this Tatooine brought along The Camp. Now non unique alien*s dirt cheap deploy costs were increased by +2-if deploying to Tatooine (+4 if deploying to same site as a Jedi). Since a big part of alien swarm is beat down the deck has died since it is impossible to beat down someone when each of your Skrillings are deploying for 5 each. Tatooine also brought along with it new dueling cards, some of which who*s secondary functions demolished non-unique aliens. All in all it is to much of a risk to play with non-unique aliens now. <br>
The problems continued as there was only a few decks for each side that could win. If you wanted to make a deck you had only a few choices of what to use. Tatooine has made it possible for you to start digging up some of your old school decks that have been collecting dust and be able to use them. S/A is back as well as the Old Nabren/Elis Helrot beats. Careful Planning and Combat Readiness are back and you are starting to see a lot of those old Tatooine mains decks again (instead of always seeing HB start with docking bays).  <br>
<br>
Now that we are talking about the new decks Tatooine has introduced I will explain what I think of the most prevalent decks in this post-tat environment. I will rate them on a scale of 1-10. <br>
<br>
LIGHT SIDE:<br>
<br>
QMC:<br>
Well I will start with, what seems to be, the most prevalent light deck at this moment. Although I cannot play QMC, hence always losing with it, I have seen others work wonders with this deck. Keeping the Empire Out Forever is huge. Before Keeping the Empire Out Forever QMC really had no advantage when it flipped (except that you could drain for more). Now with the Tunnel Vision part of KTEOF QMC is huge flipped. Not only does KTEOF let you tunnel every turn, but it also allows you to flip easier. No longer to you have to fear the aspect that you may never flip. Now all you have to do is control to Cloud City sites and then occupy Bespin. This allows you to deploy and on one turn, and do it fast. The best version I have found is the deck Alex Klammrodt (AvatR) uses. This version uses EPPs on the ground with the Han, Dash, Wedge, and Ten Numb Superstar in space. If you don*t know what Ten Numb Superstar is I will explain. It is Ten Numb on his ship (Blue 5) armed with two intruder missiles. Using this combination it is very possible to shoot down the Executor and a sure kill when shooting at a normal Star Destroyer. After hitting the star destroyer you play Power Pivot to make it immediately lost. This can cripple the dark side especially if you have just shot down Executor with pilots aboard. All in all I think QMC is a very solid deck. It*s only weakness is against ties who can shoot down all their ships. <br>
FINAL RATING 8<br>
<br>
MBO:<br>
Tatooine has brought along the helper effect Great Shot Kid which really only helps after you flip. Great Shot Kid rules once you have flipped since it allows you to deploy ANY starship from reserve deck or hand for FREE! Combine that with the 11+ card loss that comes from blowing up the Death Star as well as the force drain +2 at each system and you have a real juicy sounding deck. Well folks, from my experience this deck looks better then it really is. The problem is still that the deck is slow. And like SYCFA you are close to being dead when you finally do blow the Death Star (if you do) and your flipped advantages make little effect on the game. If Decipher really wanted MBO to be able to be competitive they should have added a paragraph to Great Shot Kid that helped the lightside to blow the Death Star faster. MBO will be a great deck if, and when, it is able to move along faster and blow the Death Star quick. As it stands now MBO cannot win consistently but is still fun to play. <br>
FINAL RATING 4<br>
<br>
WYS:<br>
While what was the most popular light deck before Tatooine may have taken a small hit WYS is still one of the best light decks out there. WYS is easily the best lightside platform for podracing since you can play your podracing interrupts again from your lost pile. WYS is also still the best lightside platform for one turn beatdowns and manipulation. The manipulation aspect was further enhanced by Tatooine, as we have seen with the invention of the Lockdown. Even though lockdown WYS is now dead you can still use beatdown, podracing, or standard WYS. Really the only deck that can tear WYS apart is Ties, so make sure to include DDTA in your deck. Start DDTA against ties and it will take then a while to get SFS set up. Since you can do so much with WYS still I think it is still one of the best lightside platforms out there.<br>
FINAL RATING 9<br>
<br>
AITC (Agents in the Court)<br>
This objective was primarily used for alien swarm decks as well as heavy mains decks. Since the only reason for using AITC as a platform for mains was to combat scum decks I doubt you will see mains used with this objective anymore (since scum is dead). Alien swarm is also toast so you really should not see this objective at all in tournament play. <br>
FINAL RATING 1<br>
<br>
RST:<br>
Wow has this deck come flying back onto the tournament scene. The new helper card The Shield Is Down has made it much more worthwhile to blow the bunker as well as helping to get set up faster (pull back door and activation +1). Another aspect of The Shield Is Down is that once you blow the bunker your opponent*s hand goes into their used pile. This allows you get get 1-2 turns of safe and healthy drains. So far there are two good RST decks. The first is standard with lots of scouts and battling cards. This version blows up the bunker and then spreads and drains with Midge for the win. This version also can pack a lot of power as the deck uses lots of scouts as well as Jedi Presence. The other RST deck that is good uses podracing and high destiny. This version causes much more direct damage and retrieves more but cannot match the power the standard has. What I mean is that if you play a ground deck it is possible to get beat out of the bunker. Where with the standard version, if they come to the bunker they are dead since you will crush them with power. If you have a lot of space in your area or mixed decks (space and ground) I would go with the podracing version. If ground beat decks are popular in your area I would advise the standard version since it almost never gets kicked out of the bunker. <br>
FINAL RATING 9<br>
<br>
HIDDEN BASE<br>
This object is really no longer used for mains, but the good old HBX has started to make a comeback. Normally when you see someone start HB that means they are normally playing space (most likely X or B-Wings). I don*t think that this is one of the best light objectives right now, but it is not bad. Can cancel a lot of drains and is a beast when flipped. You can also use podracing since you can start Yarna as your effect (to protect against monnok). Podrace HB will lose to any Hunt Down racing deck but it has a good chance against many other dark decks. <br>
FINAL RATING 7<br>
<br>
PROFIT<br>
I really thought Profit was going to be a huge hit with the new edition of more tatooine mains, but there is still the problem of activation. And if you play one of those decks that start Maul*s site and Jabba*s Palace you are dead. They will convert your Jabba*s Palace and AC and you will activate almost nothing. Activation has always been a problem for Profit, hence keeping the objective in the shadows. If you are going to play Profit then you must also play with a few 2/0 sites for activation. These sites combined with the other Tatooine sites in your deck will lower you destinies quite a bit. Of course you must remember how nasty Profit is once flipped. Profit has one of the best flip side game texts in the game as the direct damage it causes (plus the retrieval) is just plain nasty. If you can fix the activation problem then Profit is a good deck choice. But remember to beware of Maul*s site/JP start decks as they would ruin you. <br>
FINAL RATING 7<br>
<br>
TATOOINE MAINS<br>
I believe that tatooine (the planet) was made for mains and mains for tatooine. So obviously I believe that this is the best mains platform. Now most Tatooine mains use the Careful Planning start and start any two of the following sites: Obi-Wan*s Hut, Slave Quarters, Lars Moisture Farm, T Station, or Jabba*s Palace. I personally like the Slave Quarters/Mfarm start using Shmi to pull Threepio and using threepio to get all the cards you need. These tatooine mains decks are awesome fun and do very well. The downside is that you must have quite a few expensive cards (like Ben Kenobi, Jedi Luke, Qui-Gon, etc) to use the deck. <br>
FINAL RATING 9<br>
<br>
OTHER MAINS<br>
Probably the strongest mains deck, that I have seen and does not revolve around tatooine, is Hayes Hunter*s Pile. Using tons of twix sites Hayes force chokes his opponent while activating bundles. There are two drawbacks to this deck I don*t like. The first is that the deck forces you to play with a ton of location, which reduces your destiny considerably. The second is that any space draining deck like a flipping SYC (I know there aren*t many out there) or ISB blue would have a lot of drains if they get set up. The positive side of the deck is that these drain machines will have a heck of a hard time setting up since Hayes gives them no force. <br>
FINAL RATING 8<br>
<br>
MWYHL<br>
I used to love these decks but since Death Star 2 MWHYL hasn*t preformed very well. Tatooine has helped out Jedi Testing with the destruction of Mob Points. Before Tatooine MWYHL really had no chance since the dark decks would set up way to fast and you would be dead before you could complete the training. Now with mob points hurting MWYHL may start seeing play again but I still think it is a little weak. Any deck that deals damage fast will still beat MWYHL consistently. MWYHL also requires you to sacrifice either Leia or Luke for most of the game as well as giving away a lot of force in the beginning. The advantages to testing are being able to cancel force drain bonus* as well as causing opponent to have ability 6 to draw at a site, being able to pull cards, and being able to stack a card on test 5. You can do at least two of these things with QMC (Menace Fades &amp; KTEOF) which is a much stronger objective. MWYHL has the reputation of flipping right before you die, hence not being able to retrieve anything. Like not having enough force to pay for Secret Plans, or not occupying two battlegrounds for CHYBC, etc. I still am not a big fan of MWYHL and I don*t think that they are really worth playing, but that is up to you.  <br>
FINAL RATING 6<br>
