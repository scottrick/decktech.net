Why? Every single tournament, Ive had to stress over making a good Light deck, and make it so it doesnt necassarily win, but it can, under the right circumstances. DS is never an issue, whatever I have made can be brought to a tourney and win every game with no problem. And regardless of how I play, every tournament I hit, I lose with my Light AT LEAST once, especially when I play top-ranked players like Kevin Shannon and Jeff Field.<br>
<br>
Why should this be? Why does LS suck so much? Ive found any LS strategy hard to work, because theres ALWAYS about 3 DS cards to screw you over. I understand every deck has its weaknesses, but in this case, those 3 DS cards will completely wreck you, and leave you bleeding and gasping for air.......case in point.......I want to make an EBO deck. Its weakness? Decree. EBO decks have zero ground power, and even if they do, they add to that WEAK destinies. Against a RalOps, BHBM, or Hunt Down that uses Decree, how can you possibly fight them off Hoth? These decks are meant to fight on ground, whereas youre meant to fight in space......therefore, they set up and keep Decree unless you want to get beat, and screw EBO for the game.<br>
<br>
Whats worse is that Decipher doesnt care......its true, its true. I cant express how little Decipher cares through my anger at the situation, but heres some card comparisions Ive done to show you what I mean:<br>
<br>
<br>
Darth Vader vs. Obi-Wan Kenobi: Vader is a 6 power, 6 ability pilot/warrior that always adds 1 to every battle destiny. Obi-Wan is a power 5, non-pilot warrior with one hell of a weak ability, which gets offed by Circle 9 times out of 10, making the other 3 Obis in your deck useless, weak destinies.<br>
<br>
Staging Areas vs. Mobilizations Points: Ok, starting off, they do exactly the same thing, but that changes quickly. Mobilization Points grabs one of 4 systems, and jumpstarts 4 strategies plus gets you more activation....on top of that it pulls the biggest DS ship there is, the Executor, from Reserve, at your expense. Staging Areas on the other hand, allows you NON-UNIQUE Mon Cals to drop -1 and to the same system as a Rebel starfighter........uh, need I say more?<br>
<br>
<br>
even the new JPSD cards:<br>
<br>
<br>
No Love for the Empire vs. Fearless and Inventive: These are the backsides of the new LS and DS JPSD Objectives, if you dont know what they are. Starting off, they look the same, but like Staging and Mob Pts, this quickly changes. LS one gets to add one destiny to power where they have 2 aliens.....WOW. DS one on the other hand, makes Wounded Wookie destiny 5, makes your destiny +2 while Jabba and Bib on table(and make that if you try and battle Mighty Jabba and Bib, they get 2 destinies at +2 EACH, so dont think theyll be a piece of cake to take out), and in addition, get an added 2 to forfiet to all thier non-uniques. It doesnt take a genious to see which is better.<br>
Skrillings vs. Eloms? No contest.<br>
<br>
Power of the Hutt vs. Seeking an Audience: LS one gets you one of the crappiest Leia and Lando personas ever, and they dont give you any reason to use them. Artoo and Threepio also come out for a gift, and you are granted a small bonus with Luke, but what makes this a junk card is that its NOT immune to Alter, therefore a prime target for them, and therefore not being able to start it with Heading for the Medical Frigate. DS on the other hand, IS Immune to Alter, allowing Prepared Defenses to start it, and whiel above all else, grabs you Ephant Mon, Bib Fortuna, Boelo, Jabbas Barge AND Cruiser, giving the DS alot of variety than that of the LS counterpart. The barge is also 10 times more powerful, allowing everyone on it to be Immune to &lt;6.(Not to mention you can grab a free 2/0 with the Barge)<br>
<br>
<br>
In every one of these cases, the DS card is more powerful than its LS counterpart. This is exactly why its so hard to make a good LS deck that wins consistantly, when in almost any card you want to use, the DS version will beat you to the punch all the time. When you think back on this, every LS deck that has been popular except your classic Mains and Toys, had some cheesy ring to it, causing Decipher to errata and ultimately killing it off.....heres a short list of what used to be really powerful and was watered down:<br>
<br>
Operatives<br>
Hidden Base<br>
Dagobah Turtle<br>
Asteroid Sanctuary<br>
Hoth Clouds<br>
Numbers<br>
<br>
Not only these, there are probably more, but Decipher has also made one handful of the Objectives extremely hard to, if not impossible to work out, while also giving the DS counterpart, again, more juice to make it better.....heres a few examples:<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony vs. This Deal is Getting Worse All The Time<br>
<br>
Rescue the Princess vs. Carbon Chamber Testing<br>
<br>
Rebel Strike Team vs. Endor Operations<br>
<br>
There is Good in Him vs. Bring Him Before Me<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont know about you, but it looks to me that the DS versions of all these cards  are so much easier to make and work out, with the LS one needs to struggle just to maintain the flip, much less anything else, since in almost any case, one card will own and break the entire strategy.<br>
<br>
I think Ive proved to you people that DS gets almost every advantage in the current world of Star Wars. If you still cant see what I mean, take a look at the mains for LS....LS has a Hant hat deploys for 6, Chewie too, a Leia thats mre expensive than Vader, and a montrous 8 deploy for the new Jedi Luke......DS has one super expensive main, Lord Vader. Granted, the Luke and Vader is worth the deploy, but still. It used to be reversed in the fact that DS had to pay more for thier guys than LS does, now, its entirely possible for the DS to choke the Light.<br>
<br>
The whole point of this article is not to rant about how LS sucks, but to help clarify the situation, and to maybe let Decipher know that theyre making the DS cards SO MUCH more powerful than the LS counterparts, and why they cant just make the cards the same way. Please, get on the keyboard and ask Decipher why theyre doing this, and tell them to stop and think about the differences before they make and print these cards.<br>
<br>
Hang on folks, LS is going to take one bump after another, MAYBE Shadows and Skywalkers will tip the scales a little more, but only the future will tell.<br>

At least we&#146;ll always have Honor of the Jedi........... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
