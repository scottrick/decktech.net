Man, what a beautiful hotel! The room is big and roomy and the bathtub is HUGE. The AC could be better, I really like an icebox at night but it was sufficient. The Doubletree was an instant hit with my wife Christel, when you check in the give you hot cookies!<br>
 After checking in we went down ad got the lay of the land. At the elevators you could either go right towards where most of the tournaments and such were going on or left towards where the food and such was.<br>
  As soon as we went down we were seeing friends from Jacksonville and other SMs we hadn&#146;t seen since Dragon Con and some we had never met. Decipher had a Volunteer summit which was basically a marketing pow wow about Jedi Knights with looks at some of the preliminary images and a brief synopsis of their plans for promoting the game. Some mention of the new Judge programs and expectations for that but Jedi Knights took up the majority of the time. We got out of there just after midnight. We were all pretty tired from work and travel so we turned in.<br>
  Except for Michael! He stayed up till 5 am or so doing homework. He was like a zombie the next day and had to work all day but he&#146;s a college student so he took it in stride and did deck checks for worlds day 2.<br>
Friday:<br>
  This was Christel&#146;s big day, she was competing as the Dagobah regional champion in Young Jedi! It was big for me and Mike too as we were both working as volunteers all day. Chances are if you signed up for a tournament between 1:00 PM and 7PM I took your money or filed your command card! Christel met her conservative goal in the semifinals winning half her games. It was not enough to advance into the finals but she was fine with it. She&#146;ll always be the 2000 Dagobah Regional Champion for Young Jedi and nothing can take that away! Not advancing meant we could do whatever we liked the next day and just have fun.<br>
  As I said Mike was doing Deck Checks and if you haven&#146;t already heard this was pretty important stuff, especially the day before. A LARGE number of players were Disqualified on day one for a number of errors on deck lists. It seems some people did not take this seriously and paid the price. Playing a 59 card deck was grounds for Disqualification. I can understand Decipher&#146;s position on this though I&#146;m sure the people who got DQed were not happy.  I don&#146;t think anyone got DQed on day 2.<br>
  Christel had a brush with DQ herself in one of her late games as she had lost her Mos Espa (one of her opponents must have picked it up) but one of the other players was nice enough to loan her one to get her deck back to spec in the allotted time. Scary! Thanks to you if you are reading this helpful guy, Gold 4 owes you one!<br>
  My Events Entry Duty ended at 7 and we headed over to the spread they had laid out for the volunteers and oh what a spread it was! Baked Chicken and Crabcakes and lots of side items, it was delicious. I just availed myself of a to go box and loaded it up with enough to feed me and Christel both and Squadron Buddy Mitch Velasco and our friend Chris Revenaugh (who has somehow finagled a meal ticket too) also got some extra so we had plenty of chow for all of us!<br>
  At 8 it was back to work running Austin Powers constructed from 8 to 10 and then a sealed Deck from 10 to midnight. Our pal Chris kicked butt in constructed and at the end of it all he was wearing the Daddy pants and took home a shagadelic Tie Dye Austin Powers CCG shirt which really made his weekend. We managed to recruit a few new players that night and Sealed Deck had 16 players which is pretty dang good!<br>
  After I was done with that Decipher was having it&#146;s &quot;Secret Squirrel&quot; tournament for volunteers only. It was pretty cool. Everyone got 4 packs of Reflections and you built a 60 card deck using BOTH SIDES OF THE FORCE. Meaning you could put Uncontrollable Fury on your own Vader (if you pulled that lucky) and your opponent paid the price!  My packs yielded nothing useful and I fell quickly to Kyle Heuer. Up to that point I had been running on goofy energy and cappuccino but after a few minutes of actual concentration I crumpled like tissue paper and the length of the day crashed in on me and it was time for bed.<br>
   Saturday:<br>
Saturday was a great day for me! I did not have to work the con at all and I was free to do whatever I liked. My primary goal was to play in the Decipher Olympics Card Throwing competition. I have a crazy ability to hurl card incredible distances and I can also throw with pretty good accuracy so I thought this was my best chance to actually win something. At 11 we gathered in the Pavilion which was a big tent outside for the contest. The event would consist of 3 different tests of card throwing skill. The first was distance, you had to stand on a line and throw your card as far across the tent as possible.You got 5 throws and your best throw was the only one that counted. Farthest got 10 points, second farthest 8 points and 3rd got 5 points. Second was accuracy, you stood on the line and threw down a corridor between tables. Your cards had to cross a line 30 feet away and land in the corridor. It required a bit of finesse. You threw 5 cards and each one that stayed in got 1 point. Last was a pretty impossible challenge, we had to throw at a little table about a foot and a half across and if your card landed on it you got 10 points. Five shots and any that landed counted so the point potential was HUGE.<br>
  Distance turned out to be the key. I was one of the last to throw and my cards absolutely screamed across the tent. Two were like ninja throwing stars that ripped all the way across the ten at eye level and whacked the back wall of the tent and slid straight down to the floor for the longest distance by a good ten feet. If the tent wall had not been there they could have easily gone another 20-30 feet.<br>
  So I was in first with 10 points. One guy threw 4 of five on the accuracy but he had no other points and the second place guy threw 3 of five I think. I managed to throw 3 of 5 to keep the lead.<br>
  The last challenge was one that dumb luck or superior finesse could change the whole thing. One guy (whose last name was Victory of all things!) actually landed one on the table but it was only a practice shot (we each got 2 practice shots before the competition began). In the end nobody landed one on the table and I got the Gold Medal for card throwing! Mark Tuttle told us we had to wear our medals all day and I had no problem at all with that! I was really proud of having won something, even though it was a pretty goofy honor. It&#146;s just the kind of thing I enjoy.<br>
  After that we had some lunch and then I went to get some autographs from Michonne, the actress that played Aurra Sing. I had two copied of the Dawn of the Bounty Hunters book that comes with the Chronicle Books box set without he 12 inch Aurra Sing action figure and come to find out these were the very first ones she had ever autographed! She even put a little #1 and #2 on them to indicate they were the first! Now that is a pretty unique thing that really tweaks my collector instinct!<br>
  Christel was intent on watching the FSU/Miami football game and the Auburn Game after that so I took a nice 2 hour nap while she watched football. It was heaven after being so tired the day before! my players know how much I enjoy my nap on Saturday and this was especially nice. I woke up and headed down to play in the YJ Wild Wild Menace Sealed Deck, but my draws were horrible and my luck (or skill) was even worse and I lost every game except for the last one when this dimwit committed hari kari so he could take last place because they had consolation prizes for bottom two. I hate when people do stuff like that, I would have much preferred a real game then a gimme win from someone in a race to the bottom. Just shows how someone who is only interested in the prizes can ruin it for others. Another form of bad sportsmanship that disgusts me quite frankly.<br>
  Christel and I ate with Rob Silmser, a long time Squadron friend and we had a very interesting talk about the game and the directions some things had been going in and it was nice to know that I was not the only person seeing some of these things and it strengthened my resolve to keep going and doing what I can to promote the positive things where I can.<br>
  I had a better time at the big Operation Wang Chung Daddy pants tournament for Austin Powers but not much. That too was marred by bad sportsmanship, something I never thought I&#146;d see in an Austin Powers tournament.<br>
  The trouble started when they had it in the same room as the JPOTSD tournament. Austin Powers is a very loud party game and in that large room it was not long before some of the guys were screaming at the tops of their lungs, despite the angry looks from the Star Wars players who were quite rightly trying to concentrate on their games.<br>
Even after being asked to keep it down a couple of the guys continued to make much more ruckus than was really necessary.<br>
  Things got uglier when instead of cooling it after repeated requests to keep it down, this one guy at our table got belligerent and even louder. I felt really embarrassed to be in the game at all at that point. Despite all this (or maybe because of all the attention being drawn by it) I managed to win both of the first two games at our table, not easy to do with a 6 person game.<br>
  If the first two games were nasty they were only a prelude to the hideous scene that was the Daddy Pants table. The guy sitting to my left won the first game in about 5 minutes and was very funny while doing it and still managed to keep it to a dull roar, but our belligerent friend was back with a vengeance and he was downright surly by this point. Though he had quieted down he became pretty rude and bullying when a perceived misplay during a round of fast and furious bone throwing looked like it might not go his way. In the end it was all straightened out but his attitude about the whole thing was way out of line with the stakes of the game and also the tone of AP in general which is supposed to be light and fun. In the end I think he won the game but it made little difference in the final standings.<br>
  The guy to my left won first place and got a SP Tie Dye Shirt, a few packs and the game Twister. I came in second and got a few packs and a CD of Burt Bacharach&#146;s Greatest Hits (groovy baby)!<br>
  We stayed up pretty late after that, goofing around in the salon after everyone left. The Microphones were left on and I can&#146;t resist active mikes so we had a Q&amp;A session about an unnamed decipher product that we made up. It eventually evolved into Enhanced Boy Crazy product which included foil cards of boy crazy boys, and cloud city packs and Jedi Council boosters. Then Christel took the mike and did a play by play of a game Mitch and Michael were playing or Classic Star Wars while me Rob Silmser and Alex Alcalde swapped Squadron gossip and TD horror stories. Just as we were about to leave we noticed a big bag full of binders, page after page of every wars card imaginable just left there for someone to steal. We had all heard from countless people who had their stuff stolen at Decipher-Con so we took the bag to Bruce Umene for safe keeping.<br>
  A couple minutes later our friend Chris Kuebler comes running in looking sick and worried and it turns out the cards were his. He had driven off and left them in the room, completely brain fried from a long day of gaming and almost lost his entire collection.<br>
 For future reference to anyone going to any major con. NEVER BRING ALL YOUR CARDS AND FOR GOD&#146;S SAKE WATCH YOUR STUFF AT ALL TIMES!!!!!!!! I cannot tell you how many upset people I talked to who had lost valuable and difficult to replace cards to thieves. Nothing will ruin your good time faster than a moment&#146;s carelessness and a sociopath&#146;s greed.<br>
 Sunday:<br>
We overslept, the weekend was taking a toll on us. Nothing was really scheduled so we did a little bit of floating for Decipher but mostly learned how to play Tribbles, which is cool and fun and our next new game to purchase. I&#146;ll be ordering the boxed game tomorrow, this will make a great party game. It would also make a great drinking game, just add that any time you have to pass you drink and this game becomes hilarious.<br>
  We packed up and checked out and said our good-byes to everyone we could find. It was great to put faces to so many names, people I had only known through the squadron listserve and over the phone. To everyone I met and finally had a chance to hang out with a little, thanks. Shaking hands and being able to look you in the eye was a very affirming experience for me.<br>
  We left about 11:45 and made incredible time back to Jacksonville. Christel and Michael slept most of the way and cruise control set on 80 glided me through 5 speed traps with no problems.<br>
  We all really enjoyed Decipher Con. Thanks go out to: Winnfried Somerfeld, for bringing German YJ Sealed Decks and the trading, we needed those fixed cards!! To Bruce Umene for being so cool in person. To Kevin and Kyle for always being nice to me and Christel. To Kendrick for the &quot;hook up&quot;, hope your knee heals well! To Rich Loftus for everything, you&#146;re a great guy and I hope we can work together on more things in the future. To EC (eye candy) Swearington for always being cool and funny. To Lunch for representing and making your goals, I was so happy to see you in that shirt! Thanks to Mark Tuttle for editing the interview he did with me to make me seem intelligent enough to carry on a conversation, the magic of technology. To all my pals from Jacksonville for making the trip and representing our community with class and sportsmanship, way to go to Mike Regina who scored himself a set of Japanese Hoth in the Japanese sealed deck event! And especially to my travel companions and family Christel and Michael for making it fun as always.<br>
