I have been out there twice now for 2 deciphercons and will be there again this year.  It never ceases to amaze me how much differently you all play compared to us.  I&#146;m not gonna say it&#146;s better or worse, but just sooooo different.  Let&#146;s take a look at some popular decks out there right now.  Here if you aren&#146;t playin ISB space you aren&#146;t gonna win.  Do any of you East Coast players even know the power of this deck.  I don&#146;t remember reading about any them being played in the DPC.  Here is the basic strategy.  You start ISB, mob points, IAO, and another effect depending on what you are playing against.  The first turn you play a IMP command, cuz you have like 6 of them in the deck, to get Admiral piett.  He pulls the little commader from D*2 that pulls systems who by the way is an ISB agent.  They are sitting at the DB you pulled for activation.  Usually the executor DB so you can transfet them to pilots later.  You set up the Kassyk, Endor, Sullest drain with Cheneru.  They are 3 each!!! 4&#146;s if the pop PTOF. With the Imp commands and admirals like thrawn, cheneru, and ozzhole(ISB) they are only drawing 1 destiny at each system.  What superfalcon?  Then it&#146;s MAD space.  A huge drain.  Then they are gonna put ISB agents like 5d6 on your planet to reduce your dran.  The might even hit you will some generals on walkers with the IMP commands, but not usually.  Some will use the coruscant DB and the 2 systems to pull the decree on your ass.  What happened to your drain the whole time you are getting the @#$% drained out of you.  Not to mention the @#$%got Outer rim scouts being put on bargaining table to cancel your drains.  Then they play abbysin ornament to retrieve on your ass, with the retrieval they are already getting from the flipped ISB.  It&#146;s real bad news with good trackers like Brian Hunter, Van, and myself hitting you.  It&#146;s a good deck.  It&#146;s huge here why haven&#146;t i heard of it in the east coast?  Alot of people are still playing the HB mains for light but that is slowly going out of the rotation with getting it&#146;s @#$% beat with the ISB space deck ans secret plans.  Matt Reicks is playing this REALLY, REALLY mean WYS deck with 15 6&#146;s. 15!!!!!! And the palace raiders, jedi luke and what not.  He puts the jedi luke in the middle site with a bunce of run, luke, runs in his deck.  So you will always be fighting luke with a saber and palace raiders with multiple destiny.  His desitny is REDICULOUS.  You will get hit with the saber and have an attrition of 10 or more.  The whole time he is abusing his objective to play @#$% out of the lost pile like the tunnel vision combo card.  This is all complimented by the tatooine celebration being pulled of.  It&#146;s rough.  So you have to play some loopy @#$% to beat that.  Then you are gonna have to play someone like me who is still, and always will be old school.  I played SAC 10 at decipherCON, and i got 3rd this year.  Guess what?  still runnin it.  Let&#146;s look at the #1 East coast player&#146;s deck on decktech.  Hmmm.  It just happens to be WYS lewis style.<br>

Do you see any SAC protection?  @#$% if you think that i am not gonna sense every @#$%ing card he plays you are wrong.  How is that gonna win?  It&#146;s not, but he doesn&#146;t have to worry about SAC because he is on the East Coast.  It&#146;s just amazes me that a deck without that vital protection could get to be the #1 deck.  Ok let&#146;s look at some DPC winning decks.  I guarantee they wouldn&#146;t be BIG WINNDERS had the DPC been held in the West Coast atmosphere.  Here is the light winning deck-  <br>
It&#146;s the artoo HDWGITM thing.  And just want to note something that REALLY pissed me off.<br>
&quot;Secondly I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Hayes Hunter for his 3 hour conversation a month ago over AIM that inspired me to make the deck&quot;  This was in the posting of the deck.  @#$% THAT! Hayes needs to straighten up and give credit where it&#146;s due.  He got that deck from ME.  I @#$%ing made it (or at least the orginal version), and then he talked to this guy about it.  Where did Hayes Hunter get the idea?  FROM ME.  O yeah and i remember being told it was ass.  Ask Van Meclenon (or however it&#146;s spelled) who beat the crap out of him with this deck like 5 monts ago.  Hmmmm doesn&#146;t look like it. ok on with the deck, i bet you wierdo East Coast boys changed it-<br>
<br>
Ok here is another quote from the deck-<br>
&quot;NO SAC protection because didn&amp;#8217;t see any in pre day tourney.&quot;<br>
What??????  Let me get this straight,  you are plaing on a interupt(HDWGITM) dependant deck, and no sac protection.  Ok, you don&#146;t win here cuz you won&#146;t play HDWGITM all game.  How about grab?  Did anyone grab it there?  The first one will get grabbed here.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO SHIPS because LATERAL DAMAGE, DENGAR in SHIP, Grand Admiral Thraw, Imperial Command, etc. (or just ask Clint &amp; Lewis about it).&quot; <br>
NO SHIPS?????  I don&#146;t think i have to explain this.  ISB space.  GAME THE @#$% OVER. where is he gonna drain while i am draining the @#$% out of you in space?<br>
<br>
&quot;No dueling protection cause Hunt Down decks were far and few between. People in the MID-West play some wierd crap.&quot;<br>
This is cute.  Your damn right!  If you aren&#146;t playing ISB space here you are plaing DUELING hunt down.  Ok... You lose again.  <br>
I&#146;m not gonna go anymore into this deck because if you are playing it here you just lost 80% of you games.  And NO i am not saying we are better cuz some of out decks are gonna lost 80% of game is your house.<br>
<br>
Let&#146;s look at some more-<br>
<br>
Here is a HUGE difference.  Court.  NO ONE plays it here. NOBODY.  I don&#146;t know why, yet there are multiple top ten decktech decks that are this @#$%.<br>
<br>

<br>
-3 Stimmed Jim&amp;#8217;s MKOS post R2<br>
<br>
I just don&#146;t @#$%ing get it.  Why do you all of you East coast players seem to like this soooo much.  Doesn&#146;t it ALWAYS lose to the HB mains?  I would think so.  In your East Coast HB mains don&#146;t you all play the Ben Kenobis and Lando with axes?  Notice that these are anti- DS tatooine.  I am also at this point gonna give you all a history lesson on HB mains.  I went to worlds his year and got to day 3. I went 3-1 on day 3 losing to Dominic (who by the way is not east coast, him and his buddies are in what i call the foreign divsion that i will explain later in the article).  He played version #1 of the HB mains deck.  Best the @#$% out me and i lost by enought to keep me out of the final confrentation.  Then i went to the AZ mega tournament.  I loved his deck and i changed it to include more characters and less goffy-ness. HB mains v.#2  Brain Hunter quoted &quot;It was the best deck there but kyle played it dumb&quot;  Whatever.  But then he changed it to v.#4 wich was alot more conservative, won a bunch of tournaments then transferred to the east coast to what it is today.<br>
<br>
2 Get Me Another Beer Jason-DPC Winner<br>
Ok you have to be @#$%ing kidding me.  Another DS deck with out SAC protection?? Huh?  God damn I am playing profit (which i know none of you East Coasters would be caught dead playing).  I have profit with SAC!!!!  How are you gonna none shall pass me if i SENSE it?  My whole deck it SAC, mains, battle cards, and my 2 ships with landing claws.  By battle cards i mean, weapon levs, gift of the mentor, disarmeds, clashes, the sorry about the mess combo, and other mean @#$%.  How is the DS deck gonna win that game?  i don&#146;t get it.<br>
<br>
3 Stimmed Jim&amp;#8217;s MKOS post R2<br>
OK thank god!!! SAC protection.  he is running &quot;Barrier x2&quot;, hmmm. don&#146;t any of you run the bith shuffle combo?  I mean you have to here cuz the Hunt down duel deck.  They will track and duel you @#$% every game.  Have any of you notice that this card is a 5 recycler and it cancels barrier??  ok.  Here are his ships<br>
Zuckuss in ship <br>
Dengar in ship <br>
Bossk in ship <br>
Sail Barge <br>
Seriously.  Why?  If you think about it the only LS space decks are WYS and maybe HB.  Do you think that many ships is gonna do a damn thing?<br>
Here is another HUGE difference.  I still think Savrip is one of the most ABUSIVE cards in the game.  It&#146;s just rediculous.  How do you think i got 3rd at worlds this year?  I abused the @#$% out of savrip.  BUT everyone here runs 2-3 masturful moves?  why don&#146;t i see that card in the east coast decks?  it&#146;s a @#$%ingg recycleable 6 that gets you houjix and monnok, o yeah, and CANCELs savrip.  But i guess none of you ever worry about the savrip.<br>
<br>
Why not look at more shall we?<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is where we look at something that transferred from you to us.  The BHBM tie insert deck.  damn.  I got this deck from Clint over aim and have @#$%ed up everyone i know here with it.  It was just a big suprise.  Damn dude this this has the suprise factor written all over it. &quot;5 BHBM Lewis Style&quot;.  IT&#146;s currently #5 and still badass.  That deck is all East Coast power. <br>
<br>
Foreign Division - This is basically the Canadians and the germans.  Holy @#$%.  They are the best trackers in the game.  They play the game with more thought than either of us. but they also ALWAYS play wierd decks.   I&#146;ll never understand them.  but they are damn good.<br>
<br>
Anyway i was gonna go into some specific playstyles, but my fingers hurt and i can&#146;t right now.  That will be the next article.  If you want to see what i think abuut specific players i have an article written called &quot;Who&#146;s the Best&quot;<br>
That and you should check out my page i have a really cool pic of me on it and a really cool webpage about brian hunter.  any way<br>
<br>
In the typings of the Terwillgers<br>

and hopefully see all you wierd @#$% players in Vegas<br>
