<br>
My Name Is &quot;Wow&quot;. And I'm a newbie. I started playing SWCCG just a week or so ago and now have quite a collection (thanks to a few very generous friends). I decided to join Decktech and as my 1st article talk about what my 1st impressions were watching the game, then playing it. And what I like and don't like so far.<br>
<br>
Let Me Begin by saying I used to play Magic: The Gathering for a few years and ended up quiting because I got sick of burn decks and thoughtless winning. When some friends and I started magic way back, it was alot of fun building up huge armies and duking it out, but soon enough all the games ended in 10 or 15 minutes after being lightining bolted 4 or 5 times.<br>
<br>
Then a few of my friends started playing SWCCG. I didn't really take much intrest for a while, just enjoying Luke and Vader fighting and the &quot;Sparkly&quot; Cards (AKA Reflections). I tried to look at the game and learn it, but still didn't have a clue. Magic wasn't this hard. After just 2 games I understood how to play.<br>
<br>
Finally a friend of mine (who also recommened my joining here.) Gave me 2 decks and a bunch of cards. I played a few games (which I lost pretty badly mind you). After we played I started moving cards in and out of my decks trying to find cards that would work well with one another. This game was fun!<br>
<br>
Now I have a decent size collection of commons and uncommons (and a rare or two). So I took apart my decks and started building a new one... and realized how complex this game really is. What do I do? Space or Land? 2 Icons for them to force drain them or 0 Icons to give them no activation? Interrupts that save you or hurt them?<br>
<br>
Wow. It's kinda confusing when you start off. So let me list off a few things I like... and don't like so far:<br>
<br>
Likes:<br>
<br>
-Strategy. LOTS of STRATEGY. This game is one of the most complex games invented, and it's all about strategy. There are so many cards and combos that there is no ultimate deck. I looked through some of the top decks here and realized almost none of them used the same approach. Some decks are major force drains, others cross-overs. It's awesome all the cool stuff you can do.<br>
<br>
-Transition from SW to Card Game: Wow! My friend gave me BoShek as my main for my 1st light side deck. I thought his name sounded familiar and when I read his lore text latter on, I remembered I had read his story in one of the Tales books. It's amazing how almost all of the characters seen (even for a few seconds) in the movie are made into cards or ships. I think Decipher did a GREAT job at this.<br>
<br>
-Uniqueness: Quite Simply, there is no other game out there like this. It's a great original concept that doesn't need much twinking.<br>
<br>
-Laughter: Come on. How can you not love the lore texts like &quot;If Only Someone Had Given Luke A Hand&quot;. Or Brainiac's Destiny of Pi. And some of the funniest things you'd ever want to think of happen in a game. (The Cloud City Door Crushing Jabba... A Stormtrooper swiping Obi-Wan with a lightsaber.)<br>
<br>
Dislikes:<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, all games have some low points. Here's a few from the newbie:<br>
<br>
-Rares and UltraRares: Alright. I'm a newbie. Some people (including a few of my friends) have Boxes and Boxes of cards from the beginning of the game up till now. I mean, I love giving someone one of my decks and having a good fight. But When My Tie Fighters and Intercepters have to take on Super Falcon? (Seriouslly, my friend let me use his deck and Super Falcon wiped out Executor and Chimera!) My Main (BoShek) is no match for Mara Jade, Vader, Tarkin, and Blizzards 1 + 2. Without Jedi Tests or Rare Effects, I can't force drain my friends, can't attack them, and 1/2 the time I just sit around on Tatooine waiting for him to drain me to death. I don't see an easy way to solve this problem, and It's probably my fault I started so late. But I don't see how anyone getting in this late in the game can really start winning (Unless they dump a few thousand into boxes and Ebay, I guess)<br>
<br>
-Realism: A few times, this game gets a bit out of hand. I mean, why can't I deploy to Dagobah? Is there some sort of magical light side forcefield or something? And why do the show a Rebel Trooper with a blaster in the picture, yet he can't use one? I dunno.<br>
<br>
-Distrabution: Yea, the DS2 packs. I don't think I need to go into this.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's about it. I'd have to say the game itself is much better than Magic and Star Trek, it still has a few things that could be fixed, but I'm sure they'll try to every time they send out a new set. Hopefully this game will just keep getting better =)<br>
