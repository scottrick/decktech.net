What do we do with all our extra cards, what to do with the time and money invested in this game that, for a very long time, was on top for game play and design.  In the recent months, we have all heard about big D loosing the license, we have seen the tourney scene go from a strong 10+ players almost anywhere you wanted to play down to a number that we can count on one hand.  We have all seen alot of our fellow SW:CCG players jump ship and join up in the LOTR games.  This, to me, was the most dissappointing part about the mess we are all in.  It was absolutely unbelievable to see over half the local players that I have played numerous times at various Cons and other tourneys playing a new game like they didn&#146;t have any interest in SW beforehand!!  This included some of our top players here in Colo too.  I&#146;m not here just trying to complain, but I&#146;m here asking for help!!  Help your local scene to maintain the quality players that have helped make this game what it is today.  Things you will here from the lost players &quot;There&#146;s no more cards coming&quot; well, the answer to that is wrong, we will have new cards coming from our players committee.  &quot;I don&#146;t want to play with paper cards&quot;  Response: What else are you going to do with all those extra commons you all own?  &quot;It won&#146;t be supported very much longer&quot;  Wrong:  the players committee are now working with the prize support.  the tourney scene is still working the same way it did this time last year.  In fact, in my opinion, I feel we will get faster support with the PC than we did from Decipher.  &quot;No one is playing SW anymore so why should I&quot;  Simple:  If you play, others play too, if you don&#146;t, noone else will either.  My biggest example of this comes from our local gaming scene.  Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, remember this game?  I do, and alot of others locally do too.  It became a &#146;dead&#146; game but we kept it going until the news came that V:TES would be made again into an active game.  3 Sets later, we are all still playing again.  Then the newest CCG gone bad around here was L5R.  The TRUE ring game ;oP  AEG invented it, wizards bought it, wizards just about ruined it, and now AEG has it back. This game is probably the biggest game played locally.  But the news about wizards selling the game and the delay between sets just about killed the game forever.  But the locals kept it going and we are now all enjoying new sets again.  Going on our fourth new set in a year in fact.  My point is folks, that just because a game manufacturer, distributor, or whoever says that a game is &#146;dead&#146; they don&#146;t know the truth.  Games will only DIE if WE (the players) let it die.  For a couple months now, I have heard and read about boycotting the new game, people ripping on others for jumping games, etc....But what and where has that gotten us?  Divided!  The players of SW:CCG are starting to spread out into other games and sell off entire collections for next to nothing.  This is the beginning, and if it continues this way, this will be the beginning of the end as well.  <br>
  You may be sitting there asking, OK, I&#146;ve heard the complaints, I&#146;ve heard the examples, but what do you want me to do about it.  Well, that&#146;s the simple part......Continue to do the same things you all have been doing for who knows how long now.  PLAY!!  ENJOY!!  BUILD!!  TRADE!!  Everything that we have all done together now for over 8 yrs for some of us.  My parents used to tell me this all the time growing up &quot;Out of Site, Out of mind&quot;  Sound familuar?  It should, it&#146;s true, and it&#146;s happening now!  <br>
  When you see those same players playing a different game, instead of ripping them apart calling them a card traitor or ripping on them for quiting SW, put yourself in their shoes, when they say there isn&#146;t anyone playing anymore, look around, are they correct?  In alot of cases they are.  So dust off those decks and get back into the tourney scene again!!  Now that the PC has lowered the number of players needed to play a sanctioned tourney to 4 players, we all should be able to setup a new local scene to build on.  I built our local Greeley scene from being just me (as a collector) to become a full time player and a player base getting into the 20s!  It can be done, It has been done, And I&#146;m asking everyone&#146;s help to get it done!!  Keep the best Damn CCG Alive!!  Promote our local scene and enjoy the times we will all share in the future!!<br>
