QMC can be effective, if played right. DBO doesn&#146;t totally suck, but there are many other better objectives out there, and finally, these articles are geared towards those who wish to find ideas (while most are not new) and compare these ideas to find the better and more suitable style of decktype. I&#146;m not here to tell you how to make the ultimate invincible super deck, just here to give ideas and compare objecive cards. For those of you who complained about my not rating those objectives, I&#146;ll sum it up right now, but keep in mind these are MY thoughts on the objectives, and it&#146;s one man&#146;s opinion. Quiet Mining Colony: 3 out of 5 stars. TDIGWATT: 3 out of 5 stars. DBO: 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. ROps: 4 out of 5 stars. Any complaints? I&#146;m not explaining enough? Read my articles, they should explain it all. Now, let&#146;s begin with the introduction, shall we?<br>
<br>
     When Death Star II came out, many people praised the new objective cards and deemed them the &quot;ultimate&quot; objectives. You could instantly win the game in one duel, and the opponent had to lose 2-3 force just for not having a Vader/Luke on table! Even I was lured into believing everybody would play these objectives at the next tournament. But no, they didn&#146;t, they were not what I expected of them. I&#146;ll explain each individually now and continue evaluating these cards, but separately.<br>
<br>
     Part 1: There Is Good In Him/I Can Save Him: Ok, let&#146;s look at the card. Deploy Chirpa&#146;s Hut (with Luke and his saber there) and the Landing Platform. You generate +2 force at Luke&#146;s location and you may not drain or generate ANYTHING if an Imp is at the platform. You also start out with I Feel The Conflict. Luke gets snatched by an Imp immediately if they&#146;re at the same site. You cannot break free with Strangle or Captive Fury, and you can&#146;t play Alter. What do you get out of all of this? If the Imp isn&#146;t Vader, the dark side must lose 2 force at the end of each of their turns. If it is Vader, you may, once per turn, attempt to cross him. If you draw destiny greater than 14, you win. If not, wait till next turn. How do you draw a destiny 15? Well, there&#146;s two ways. The first way is to attempt to draw a little 5 at the end of a destiny 1 card and try to get away with it (not very wise, LOL!). The second way is to win a lot of battles, which stacks a few cards under I Feel The Conflict, which in turn, adds 3 to that destiny. So, for example, if you win 3 battles, you&#146;ll need to draw a 6 to cross Vader. If you win 4 battles, you&#146;ll need a 3 to cross him. That&#146;s about all for this objective, now let&#146;s look at the different types. <br>
<br>
     First type of TIGIH is the Eloms/Speeders variant. In this type, you concentrate on protecting Luke with Eloms and Snowspeeders, while using numbers to cause big damage. Eloms are destiny 4, Luke is 6, and the speeders don&#146;t count, so you&#146;re going to cause 11 damage each insert, considering he has Vader and 2 crap destiny mains out. The numbers are used to cause damage to a non-interactive player, while speeders are to win battles against an interactive player. This is quite balanced, except many cards will hurt this strategy. Search And Destroy, You Cannot Hide Forever, and alien beatdowns are all commonly used and will severely hurt this type of TIGIH. <br>
<br>
     The second type is the docking bay version. With this type, you&#146;ll generally want to start Insurrection and Staging Areas, pull docking bays, drain and go to the opponent&#146;s sites to do battle. Fallen Portal is a good friend of yours. Make sure you make its acquaintance with low ability DS characters (namely Abyssins). You activate massive force at the docking bays, which allows you to play some expensive space and ground cards. This type fares quite well against many dark side decks because of the growing popularity of DBs. He&#146;s got Vader sitting at the D*2: DB? That&#146;s okay, just transit over there and surrender! Who cares about that 9 force for transit? It&#146;s worth it in the end, and you can pay it easily because of Staging Areas and all those DBs. Some cards/decktypes that hurt this decktype are: Sense (you can&#146;t Alter it and many other obvious reasons) and a heave space deck (They&#146;ll just outdrain and outbattle you).<br>
<br>
     This third, and last, is the scout variant. Many people find this to be a &quot;machine&quot; deck because it relies heavily on searching your reserve deck and setting up stuff. It plays like a machine, or so to say, it always plays the same way, turn by turn. I can&#146;t help but be too specific here, but as I mentioned, this deck is a machine. You start out with HFtMF as Starting Interrupt, Strike Planning, Insurrection, and (insert starting effect here) as starting Effects. Use Strike Planning to pull General Crix Madine and (insert some general here). Insurrection pulls your Home One: Docking Bay (for activation purposes). Use Crix&#146;s text to pull Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk, who in turn pulls out Wuta, who in turn gives you a strong activation early on. Next turn, Crix pulls out Corporal Beezer, who in turn searches for Portable Scanner, which in turn searches for a weapon. Next turn, she can search for Obi-Wan&#146;s Journal or whatever. Like I said, this deck is a machine and pulls like mad. Some problems with this deck is the number of cards you must devote to getting this setup complete and that it&#146;s very fragile, because everything must be in reserve, or it breaks the uniformity of it all. Why is this decktype effective? It fares well early on and gets going quickly, provided you can find everything in reserve. Also, there are a number of interrups that greatly boost the efficiency of your scouts. To name a few, Covert Landing (which I could have made another type on, but the two are generally so similar that I merged them), Firefight (especially if Portable Scanner is used to pull weapons), Close Air Support (providing you use Talas, which you should, right?), and Insertion Planning (this card was made for scouts!). While this decktype may seem very similar to Rebel Strike Team, it doesn&#146;t focus on destroying the generator (by the way, do ANY RST decks blow up the generator?!?!?) and spreading scouts around, this decktype plays a little more reactive, since you must win battles to flip.<br>
<br>
     This concludes my review of styles of TIGIH, and in conclusion I would like to rate TIGIH 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. Why? This decktype is very efficient in many ways, it is also flexible, and it doesn&#146;t require much brains to play, just balls. What makes this decktype so unappealing is its main character. You must give the opponent Luke, an excellent all-around character, and expect to win lots of battles. Hmmm, that leaves Han, Lando, Leia, Obi, and Orrimarko to do the majority of your fighting. Speeders? Nah, lots of DS players know how to own speeders. Eloms? Nah, too much Court, MKoS, and good aliens running around hungry for Elom soup. Han and Lando? Hmmm, okay, but CCT will limit you to Obi, Orri, and Leia. Not much, is it? Especially if you wanna OWN everything on table. What does that leave the ds? If Vader&#146;s in hiding, that leaves, Jabba, Ephant, Boba, Palpy, Mara, etc. You get the point. Dark side just about knows how to get around on ground, much less with 3-5 characters that do the brunt of this battling. That&#146;s my two cents on TIGIH.<br>
<br>
     Part 2: Bring Him Before Me/Take Your Father&#146;s Place: This decktype has pretty much taken the tournament scene by storm. What does it do? It allows you to pull Palpy from reserve (and deploy -2!) and the opponent may deploy Luke from reserve OR lost pile (-2 as well ;(). Also, it gives you a strong start, and the ability to capture Luke outside of battle, if present with Vader. This is great, because you can deploy Emperor first turn to the Throne Room, and force the opponent to lose 3 force if Vader is at a battleground site, and Luke is not. Once Luke is captured, which shouldn&#146;t be too hard, you must lose 1 force every turn. Not good, but things aren&#146;t looking too good for your opponent either. Why? The objective allows you one duel per turn. If you lose, you win. Sounds wierd, but look up the objective. If you win, ls loses 3 force. Not too shabby, and the objective doesn&#146;t eliminate one of your characters from play, like TIGIH does for Luke. <br>
<br>
     The first type I&#146;ll discuss, and one of my personal favorites, is the manipulator version. This variant is fairly easy to set up, and generally never goes for the flip. The objective reeks of manipulation, because it allows you to deploy Palpy (destiny 6) to a non-battleground (Throne Room) where he&#146;ll be safe. The manip starts with numbers (3,720 to 1) and also has a little room for M&#146;iiyooms (if you like her style). Good high destiny characters to use numbers are: Garindan, Myn Kyneugh, Tech M&#146;or, R5-A2, Emperor, and M&#146;iiyoom. Numbers cause the brunt of the damage, while M&#146;iiyoom sets up a lock by killing off their unique males. Mobilization Points and Imperial Arrest Order were made for this deck. Deploy DBs (non-battleground ones), have a guy at the odd one, activate en masse, and use it for M&#146;iiyoom&#146;s text and whatever else you may need. Heavy space wouldn&#146;t hurt too much either, just in case they try to evade M&#146;iiyoom by using Squadron Assignments on a ship searching for its matching pilot. This decktype is an excellent example of a manipulator, and it performs quite well. Also, you may want some heavy SAC, because anything goes with Palpy on table. Some cards/decktypes that abuse it are: Eloms/Speeder TIGIH, Your Insight Serves You Well, and that&#146;s all I can think of.<br>
<br>
     The second variant is a dueling BHBM. That is to say that you play for the flip, with intentions of crossing Luke over. Generally, you&#146;ll want cards that help you win battles and that punish non-interactive opponents. Search And Destroy, I Have You Now, and Emperor&#146;s Power are great examples. After you&#146;ve won your 4-5 battles and have caught Luke, then you bring him to Palpy to duel Vader. The problem with this deck is keeping Vader alive and that can often times be difficult to do. You may want some defensive cards and some good characters to support him. While they&#146;re at the Throne Room, nothing should get in your way. Cards/strategies that abuse this strategy are: Hidden Base decks (they can mass up some significant power and you shouldn&#146;t be playing too much space), Heroic Sacrifice, On The Edge (sacrificing Luke just before Vader hits is quite annoying), and Profit decks being played right.<br>
<br>
     The third type of BHBM is the non-dueling. Many Hunt Down veterans are used to hearing this one. Really, if you want to mass up power and do huge beatdowns and what not, play HD. BHBM should be dueling and is not as effective as HD if played this way. But if you insist, I can give ideas. First of all, you&#146;ll want power characters (you know &#146;em all, they&#146;re in every ds deck nowadays), which shouldn&#146;t be a problem, good enough space to handle decent opposition (you should be familiar with these as well, ZiMH, Executor, BiHT, DiPO, etc.), which is also easy, and last but not least, real nasty interrupts. Many people love Dark Jedi Presence and I Have You Now, many people have their own little setups. This is what it all boils down to. Interrupt selection can make or break a deck. There are so many good examples out there, so look and you shall find.<br>
<br>
     I hope you have enjoyed reading this article as much as I have enjoyed typing it up. If you have any new ideas that I didn&#146;t post, good for you, you&#146;re one step ahead. If you found nothing new, I hope you have at least compared the different types and evaluated them all yourself to better decide how you should play and focus on these objectives. For rating, I give BHBM a 4 1/2 out of 5 possible stars. It would have been 5 out of 5, but scratch 1/2 for predictability alone. The fact that so many people play this deck makes it predictable. Many players have adapted their ls decks to include cards that hurt dueling BHBM (the predominant type). In my next installment of this series of articles, I will discuss the two objectives that were completely broken and rocked the world over. These objectives were the best ever at one point, but are now the worst ever, IMHO. Part four will be all about Local Uprising/Liberation and Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control. Please give me constructive criticism for this article, if any, and tell me why this articls sucks/rules, and what I can do to make it better. Also, open your minds to TIGIH and BHBM and think about all the little factors that make it such a crappy/kickass deck. There are many decktypes that I didn&#146;t mention (such as Trooper BHBM), but these types play almost the same anyways, so why bother wasting time? Royal Guard BHBM plays the exact same as Royal Guard ROps and TDIGWATT Royal Guard. In theory, they all concentrate on setting up Guards for draining and defending. In conclusion, I would like to give credit to all those who reviewed my previous articles, regardless of the remarks or stars. It is because of your support that I continue to write these articles, and attempt to open your minds to the objectives at hand and how differently they can be played/implemented.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2171"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2171"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2171" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
