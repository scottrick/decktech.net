<br>
Well there is so much to talk about.  I quess my first subject will be the decipher BBS.  Now i don't know if any of you go there, but good god some of those people are just damn annoying.  Some actually have opinions too.  Let's just go there right now and take some examples-<br>
we should all boycott swccg until they agree to make the episode I version compatible with the.txt ... super rancor ... [4/ 4/00 21:59]<br>
Now what the hell is that?  We sould all boycott SW.  what an idiot. god. anyway let's scroll down some more.<br>
some thoughts on card pronunciations- txt ... ISBop ... [4/ 4/00 20:44]<br>
How about this one.  Who gives a crap??<br>
Read about my problems... ... Dr. Scratchansniff ... [4/ 4/00 19:55]<br>
O thanks i came to talk about the SWCCG and you are gonna @#$% about your personal life.  Thanks.  And it just goes on and on like this until i decide to leave.<br>
How about some profiles?<br>
Bossk Hogg- Thinks he knows EVERYTHING.  Although i will have to admit most of the time he is right.  I still think that he is part of a message board team.  I mean he is always on.  I wouldn't doubt if they have t-shirts.<br>
Dantlyr + Statman- In the words of Jedi_Hunter she is a haughty @#$% (i live that i get to say that here).  Not really much to say here.<br>
Faramir-  He actually has something to say.  Thank god there is someone compitent there.<br>
Yodatuna-  He has a good site.<br>
Not really anyone else to talk about.  the thing i really hate about it is how you can get banned for nothing.<br>
<br>
Next, the listserv.  Good god how many of you does it take to answer a friggin question?  And do any of you have anything to talk about except to complain about there not being a new CRD?  And the fact that i almost got banned for posting the top 10 sexually suggestive lines in the star wars trilogy is just gay.  here you read them and tell me that this is a bannable offense.<br>
Top ten sexually suggestive lines in the Star Wars Trilogy<br>
<br>
Star Wars<br>
10. 'Get in there you big furry oaf, I don't care what you smell!'<br>
9. 'Luke, at that speed do you think you'll be able to pull out in time?'<br>
8. 'Put that thing away before you get us all killed.'<br>
7. 'You've got something jammed in here real good.'<br>
6. 'Aren't you a little short for a storm trooper?'<br>
5. 'You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.'<br>
4. 'Sorry about the mess...'<br>
3. 'Look at the size of that thing!'<br>
2. 'Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough!'<br>
1. 'She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.'<br>
<br>
The Empire Strikes Back<br>
10. 'I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.'<br>
9. 'Size matters not. Judge me by my size, do you?'<br>
8. 'There's an awful lot of moisture in here.'<br>
7. 'But now we must eat. Come, good food, come...'<br>
6. 'That's okay, I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.'<br>
5. 'Hurry up, golden-rod...'<br>
4. 'I must've hit it pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh kid?<br>
3. 'Possible he came in through the south entrance.'<br>
2. 'And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!'<br>
1. 'Control, control! You must learn control!'<br>
<br>
Return of the Jedi<br>
10. 'Hey point that thing someplace else.'<br>
9. 'I look forward to completeting your training. In time you will call me master.<br>
8. 'I never knew I had it in me.'<br>
7. 'There is good in him, I've felt it.'<br>
6. 'Grab me, Chewie. I'm slipping -- hold on. Grab it, almost...<br>
you almost got it. Gently now, all right, easy, easy, hold me, Chewie.'<br>
5. 'Hey, Luke, thanks for coming after me -- now I owe you one.'<br>
4. 'Back door, huh? Good idea!'<br>
3. 'She's gonna blow!'<br>
2. 'I think you'll fit in nicely.'<br>
1. 'Rise, my friend.'<br>
<br>
But of course, one of the best is -<br>
'Wedge! Pull out! You're not doing any good back there!'<br>
<br>
Come on!, if that's bad you are all have serious problems with loosening up.<br>
<br>
How about some of the players in our community.<br>
Brian Hunter.  Yes he looks just like jesus, and no he soesn't have an inflated rating.  Neither does anyone else.  All of you people that whine about it are just jealous and need to shut your mouths, gibronis.<br>
Clint Hayes-  Holy crap he is good.  And no he is not a jerk.  I thought he was pretty cool.<br>
Terwilligers-  Nice guys<br>
Brian Fred- Your mind tricks don't work on me.  You should have won that game vs. my dark deck.  Very cool.<br>
Girard- Good player, funny guy.<br>
Matt Reicks-  doomed to never, ever win a tournament with another high rated player in it.<br>
John Arent- by far one of the best players in the world with horrible luck.<br>
<br>
How about this decktech place.	It's good to share ideas.  And it's good to get involved, but some of you people are just sad idiots that can't think for themselves and have to copy others work.  I mean i saw a guy on the BBS that asked what cards he should put in this deck he got off of decktech for the ones that he didn't own.	Idiot.	And from what i have seen this place is just like middle school.  the popular people get high ratings.	come on we should be bigger that that.<br>
<br>
Another thing about the players.  According to my friends card flopping is 'geeky.'  Well i though about it and o my got most of us are.  Well i went over this list and decided that if you actually do like 20 out of these 60 things you do have problems.<br>
