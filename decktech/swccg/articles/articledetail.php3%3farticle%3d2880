Thanks to everyone who found part 1 useful and insightful, I&#146;m glad I could help. In response to the not so nice reviews; this series of articles is not a soppy love story about my fiancé playing Star Wars, it is a guide, using my teaching Method on Illiyana as an example, to aid players who are trying to teach the game to beginners. It is a training method that tries to avoid new players getting into bad habits, and instilling good ones from day one. The goal is to raise the playing standard, across the board as teaching the game can be helpful for a mentor, refreshing the basics in their head, and helping a new player at the same time. Now for the second part of this Jedi-Training trilogy.<br>
<br>
At this point, your Padawan should have the basics down (phases, card types, and the basics of game play). Now it&#146;s time to build on the foundation of knowledge attained and begin incorporating the variations in the game that makes it so challenging.<br>
<br>
Note: These are probably the most important aspects of teaching someone, where patience is most required. The following two steps can be a long, time consuming process, but essential in getting results with your Padawan. Remember that the dark path is quick and easy, the way to become a Jedi is through time and patience.<br>
<br>
STEP 3 (Card Knowledge)<br>
	Now, when it comes to bombarding a beginner with information, card knowledge is one of the key offenders, great patience is required. The best thing to do in my opinion is to go through the cards first, then go through the ruling documents as a separate step. There are exceptions, like errata&#146;s, but let your Padawan gain knowledge about the cards before introducing them to the glossary, or the CRD, otherwise you put your Padawan in danger of their head exploding.<br>
	Now, with Illiyana, card knowledge wasn&#146;t much of an issue. As a matter of fact before I asked her to start reading cards and get a basic feel for them, she had covered everything up to Dagobah (she loves to read). Once Illiyana had gone through my sets, even though we were still playing with the basic decks I had constructed, she read through some of my constructed decks to get a feel for the predominant cards. She also had a look at some deck lists to test her memory on the cards and what they did. Following this, Illiyana also looked through my trade folder and the folders at the local card shop, reading away, and also realising how much money I have spent on the game since it&#146;s release.<br>
	The way in which a beginner learns the cards will vary from Padawan to Padawan, and the way I recommend this be approached is with an open mind. Everyone absorbs information differently, so my theory is to ask your Padawan how they feel most comfortable with learning the information, and come up with something that works for your Padawan, but make sure the end result is always the same, that your Padawan has an understanding of the cards. The more knowledge gained here, the more your Padawan will be advantaged in the long run.<br>
<br>
STEP 4 (Decks Phase Two)<br>
	Now we start getting down to the nitty gritty, and the part of training where things get interesting, and your Padawan&#146;s first major test in the game, where the skills learned over the last three steps are finally put into practice with the construction of your Padawan&#146;s first two decks. This is the step where your Padawan will be introduced to the glossary and the CRD.<br>
	Please remember that now comes the time where the guidelines I am recommending are just those; guidelines. Just as in step three; talking to your Padawan is essential because this is the point at which their preferred style of play will become evident in deck construction.<br>
	With Illiyana, I decided to sit her down with a bunch of objectives, and went through how the basics worked. For example, profit; a very straightforward objective, and one that was easy to explain. After selecting the objective we were going to work with I once again, showed her my folders, and asked her to select cards that she thought would be appropriate for the deck. Of course some of the cards selected were a little strange, but giving her the opportunity to select cards instilled confidence in her because regardless of the deck&#146;s success or failure, it was HER deck. Once she had wrote down all of the cards, Illiyana faced a problem that faces many of us in deck construction, she had a list of 85 cards excluding my recommendations, so basically we had a list of 110 cards from which to make a 60 card deck. At this point I began explaining to Illiyana why I recommended certain cards, and why some of the cards she had selected were not the optimal choices. As well as this, I also began explaining the concept of card efficiency, and balance when it comes to constructing a solid deck. After all of this, I left Illiyana by herself to construct her 60-card deck, and to my surprise, the deck she constructed was very good for a first attempt, she took my advice on cards and construction as well as using her own ideas. I&#146;m not saying that Illiyana was going to play in a tournament next week and win, but her progress was clear<br>
	After repeating the process with a dark side deck, Illiyana was ready for her first games with her first decks. I played with the decks she built against her to make sure she didn&#146;t get too confused with other decks. That is a lesson to be learnt at a later point, for now I just wanted to see how her knowledge was progressing, and to see what pieces (if any) of information she hadn&#146;t grasped. This would give me an idea of how to bring her into an environment of experienced players, and what I had to work on teaching her. <br>
	Now as I said earlier, there are many ways to teach your Padawan, this is only the method I used with Illiyana, and everyone has different learning speeds and methods. The main points I would like to point out are the things that need to be covered, things like card efficiency, balance, and probably most important of all, card reasoning. If your Padawan can cover all of these things, then they are well on their way to becoming a Jedi.<br>
	The final part of this step, was to send Illiyana home with her decks, a copy of the glossary and the current rulings document for her to practice and read at her own pace. This was in preparation for step 5, and bringing her closer to her biggest test yet, her first tournament. <br>
	Please be sure when teaching your Padawan to keep an eye on the small things, and not to push too hard, they will learn. There is no point in throwing them into the deep end and telling them how to play, that is a process for the Padawan to grasp alone, your job as a mentor is to guide your Padawan, and fill in the gaps for them.<br>
<br>
STEP 5 (developing knowledge)<br>
	Now this is more of a step that consolidates on everything your Padawan has learned in the previous three steps and covers the pieces that might have been missed or haven&#146;t sunk in. It is basically a test of your Padawan&#146;s knowledge, and at the same time, a test of your patience as a mentor.<br>
	Illiyana returned to my house a week after the construction of her first deck. At this point, she began asking me all sorts of questions about the rules document and glossary. The way I approached this was simply explaining obvious rulings on things like timing and actions etc&amp;#8230; and explained that other rules would become more clear through time and experience. Then we had a few games with her decks, as I still felt she needed to become comfortable with what she was playing. After each game, I explained the little mistakes and moves that cost her the game. Things like being ready for a counter attack if you initiate battle, leaving some force, and only drawing to 12 cards. Things that would solidify her basic play skill. This continued for 2 weeks, and gradually, Illiyana became more confident with the decks she had built, and was asking to construct her second decks. As I explained to her, confidence is a good thing, but just as the mentor, the Padawan must also have patience.<br>
	This is a point where your Padawan is beginning to enter an expanded environment, but as I warned earlier, you must be patient, and be stern. There is no point in letting a Padawan go off on their own now they have come so far. Be sure that they have a grasp on everything covered so far and that they realise the fact that there is still a lot to learn.<br>
<br>
	On a final note, to anticipate a couple of questions I think may be raised. I have not displayed any of the decks used in this training method, as it is up to the individual how they train their Padawan. I am merely making suggestions.<br>
<br>
In closing, remember that this is just a guide, and this method may not work with everyone, but it has worked for Illiyana, and the other Padawan&#146;s I have taken under my wing. I hope that this article, along with the first (Taking on a Padwan) are useful tools in bringing new players into the game. After all, we need new players to keep the game alive, and they need to be trained well to maintain a high play standard and ensure the future of our great game. <br>
