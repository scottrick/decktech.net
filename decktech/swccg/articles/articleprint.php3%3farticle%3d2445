But I can t find a way to update my editorial, so I will put it in a article . I wrote it like 4 month ago, and it got nothing to do with Tattooine. There is some vulgar and funny sh1t. So if you don t like that, or you got a problem with that or with me, just don t read it . I don t force you to. <br>
<br>
Let the story begin. <br>
<br>
Since it was created, the game of SWCCG attracted people from all around the globe. Even Carlos Bravo, Crugen Dunn Flanagan and Pedro Astasio. <br>
<br>
As you are playing against your friends, they will tweak their deck to have a better chance to beat you, and you will do the same . That s because nobody like to loose, everybody want to be the best, its in the human nature. Have you ever seen a guy nude running in the street saying:   hehe, I am so ugly, look at my hairy a$$, haha, it even got a monkey stuck in it.   No, we wanna be the best, we want people to know us, and respect us ! And that s the reason why every region of the world got different play style. <br>
<br>
Now I ll talk about the best region . <br>
<br>
Americans: ( Oh Sh1t . 99% people here on Decktech are American . I Better watch what I will say:) Well, those guys are machine . nothing more to say. <br>
<br>
Canadians: That s me right ???? ERRRRRRRRRR !!! Wrong answer. I am Quebecers. I won t talk about Canadians since they never manage to get top 12 at world. I have nothing against Canadien (Except they were stupid enough to put Jean Cretins as a prime minister, and sell Eskimo some ice cream .) but, I am no Canadian at all., Quebecers are different from Canadian . in every ways . especially penis size . Do you wanna hear my theory on that ??? if your below 21 AND your answer is no, you can skip that part. <br>
<br>
---------------------------Warning------------------ OK, we seems to have the same size as average canadien . unfortunately for them . no. We got the same size . but our temperature is fuc*ing cold here . :) this mean that at same temperature . ours is 2 inch longer . <br>
<br>
ALLRIGHT Americans, I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU !!! : Those guys always play good deck. Deck that made their proof. Deck that never let you down. Deck that can win against almost anything. They played the most metaed deck. They play deck like HDADTJ and TRM. They play deck that can hold in ground and in space. So when you play against them in a big tournaments, it s always a though match. I think that the American s weaknesses is that they have difficulty to spot new strong unorthodox deck. So in world class tournaments where people from everywhere come. They get surprised, and looses game they should not, just because they did not expect a Dagoba deck to be strong, or something like that. Hey, I am just talking in general, and I know there is exception. Some US of A player try new things. The name of Clint Hayes, TJ Oldman and Steven Lewis comes into my mind. And that s probably a reason for their success. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quebecers: I think they are not afraid of trying new strange underrated things. Like QMC, RTP, DAG, TIE SCOUT, 15 scanning + 10 sabac Deck. The 1 turn kill deck. Those are only a few of the weird deck we once played. In English language, its call Jizzzzz deck, my region is pure Jizz. Some of those deck got famous, so they became well known, and people forgot who invent it. Some other deck were worth sh1t and stay in our local shop. This can help us as much as it can destroy us in big tournaments. But usually its good, since we used Decktech to meta against the popular deck. I think we are very open to new deck idea . that s why we USUALY spot the good deck. But really the biggest difference from the US of A player is that we use much more jank card and you guys use more character. Let s just take a look at the BHBM I play at world, and the BHBM Little Twigg played. I am going to use my deck as an example because Yannick play the same and Raph too. And Little Twigg deck is the kind of BHBM I saw everywhere at world. <br>

This is the average . If we compare our throne room against yours, you will have more guys than us . Compare any deck, and it will be like that. <br>
<br>
Is any deck better ??? I don t think so. They are different. We have more High Destiny. You have more power that stay on table. We use lots of interrupts to have the maximum efficiency with every character. But still, we can t win a game without card that got ability. It s only a matter of choice. Oh yeah, there is 1 more thing about us . we are excessive, the way we think is : If a card is good, and it got a good destiny . well put 4 in the deck. To make sure we have them fast. Just last month Yannick wanted to play a profit deck with 8 tunnel vision ! And I think 2 luke and 1 ben . He is crazy on high destiny. But Raphael is really the master of the excess . When he check your deck, he is like : what ? you only use 5 Effective repair ? add 2, after all you only use 6 AFA .   <br>
<br>
I think this is the order of country that use the more goofy card <br>
<br>
4-Americain <br>
3-Uk <br>
2-Quebecers <br>
1-Germans <br>
<br>
As I play against my friend, I notice our lack of character makes us draw huge hand... thus, we are more vulnerable to grimtash/monnok than most player, but we got more surprise card. <br>
<br>
Germans: Those guys are crazy ! Man, when I look at their deck I am like . is he kidding , or is it a real deck ? hehe , its probably a fake deck . Then I read 1 of their tournament report, and it was a real deck !!! Most of the time, they use card I have never heard of. Those guy are I think the most patient player. Their deck are weird. Much weirder than Quebecer s deck. And surprise are their best advantage. Their weaknesses is, in my opinion . When you put pressure against them, with fast deck. They usually can t handle it. But if you play a slow deck . you have a good chance of seeing your butt hole grow bigger . 1 more particularity about them is that they are anti-excess They need to smoke a Fu*king big Chico to put 2 times the same card. It is very common to see 60 different card in the same pile .. Or deck . Whatever :) And Bastian is hilarious beside always saying whatever. At world I ask him to sing me Branglus Glee, and to Write something funny on it. And he wrote   Track this !!!   And At the airport I was taking with my friend, and I told him:   Hehehehe Bastian Was stupid, I would never track Branglus, it s a sh1t card, why didn t he wrote something funny like I ask him   . And my friend goes :   hehe your so stupid Dom, that s why its so funny  And I goes :   hou oi oi ou ouo ou I God, I am so stupid   . <br>
<br>
UK dude: Those guys have a cooooooooooooool accent when they talk. That s their advantage. No, I am just kidding, I pretty much think they have a play style between Quebec and USA. Their ability to play after drinking 20 beer is incredible. Some legend even say those guys are 40% better after drinking a hole bottle of vodka . I even tried it . unfortunately I don t remember much about that night. <br>
<br>
Yeah, there is other country that got good players. Sweden and Netherlands.. and some more . But I don t know them that well to pronounce myself on this subject. <br>
<br>
Conclusion <br>
<br>
Did you guys knew there was more people in New-York that in the hole Canada ? That mean USA used to have a huge meta advantage over small country. Especially when they were play testing for world championship. <br>
<br>
<br>
Well, you know what is happening ??? Everybody got internet. And what does that do ??? We can go to XXX site, so its easy to see Pamela Anderson nude. And what s the point ? There is no point. But why did you wrote that ? Because I am stupid. Hey, I already knew that you know. No !!!! that s not what I meant. Because of the Internet, especially Decktech, region shear their   deck  and   tech  It is now much more global. The more time passes, the more it will be the same all around the world. Since its very easy to see what people are playing everywhere, we all copy idea, deck. and strategy that we think is good. I don t know if it s a good or a bad thing, I can only tell you it s the way it is. The way of the FORCE ! <br>
<br>
During this article, I tried to be the more subjective as possible. I think I am really close to reality, since I am reading most Tournament report on this web site. But its only my opinion, based on things I saw. Every style got their advantage, and as long as your feel good with it, I don t think any is better. So now, my article is over, and I suggest you go take a shower. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, in case I don t see you tonight, happy birthday. <br>
