<br>
This is not a guide to how exactly construct a Rebel Strike Team or which cards you must add, but my point of view on how RST might going to be played and some interesting concepts. Some of you might think I should have given a complete list of scouts or interrupts, but I do not think this is the place for doing such. There are plenty of really good RST decks out there in Decktech, so take a look at them if you want to have card lists for the deck. I will soon post my own deck and you will then have the chance to rate my card list, but till then, please rate only this little ideas. Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
RST is the deck I’m now playing in tournaments; why? Let me explain my reasons.<br>
<br>
Rebel Strike Team is one of the most fun objectives to play with, I feel everyone will be with me if I say blowing the shield up is one of the best moments in the whole game. Well, until Tatooine comes out this was not very easy to do even with the good help the objective was able to give. Despite this, a few decks run in the tournament scenario with the epic event in their decks, but were very few.<br>
Now, we have one of the best helper effect in all Tatooine set, The Shield Is Down. Lets see it in some detail:<br>
<br>
• The Shield Is Down! <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Effect <br>
[R] <br>
Lore: Lando&#146;s confidence in the Rebel strike team on the forest moon was rewarded, and proved to be a decisive factor at the Battle of Endor. <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If Rebel Strike Team on table, your Force generation is +1 at Endor sites and you may deploy Back Door from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. When Bunker &quot;blown away,&quot; retrieve 8 Force and opponent must place their hand in Used Pile. (Immune to Alter.) <br>
<br>
<br>
One of the best things this deck used to provide was the huge amount of force you were allowed to activate in the middle game, but in honest, the early activation was not so good as, in the first two or three turns, you used to expend the whole activated force in deploying scouts and searching for the epic event and Back Door. Now, you activate 1 extra force per site, so you start with 6 force plus whatever your opponent gives you, and nowadays is at lest 1. So, normally you will activate 7 force in turn 1, that means you can deploy Madine, who search for Chewie and deploy with Madine, who search for Wuta (deploy free), who search for a site; all this in your first turn, WOW!. This means that you will be able to activate: 6 for the 2 sites and system, plus 2 for the effect, plus the 1 you add, that’s 9 by your own and what your opponent gives you. Now you are able to deploy big and even draw some cards.<br>
Not only this but you can deploy Back Door from Reserve Deck for free, so you can use Wuta and search for BD whenever you are prepared to blow the bunker up.<br>
<br>
The other advantage the new effect offers is when you blow the bunker. Making the epic event gives you one big help: your 7 side objective can not be flipped back if your opponent control Endor, and nowadays this is not very difficult thanks to the heavy space fleet DS use to play. But there is something better with The Shield Is Down. Now, not only your opponent loose 8 force but also you retrieve the same amount and the coolest thing under my point of view, your opponent must place his entire hand in his used pile. Now, if you usually blow the bunker by turn 3 or 4, your opponent will surely have his best cards in his hand by the time, and he must “loose” all them? WOW again, that means he will be quite indefense for 1 or 2 turns, and that is all you need to finally kill him. He can not cancel or modify your force drains and they will be BIG, trust me they will.<br>
<br>
OK, all this was for the Objective, Effect and Epic Event, but there are other points as important as the previous ones. Which? the cards this deck allows you to play.<br>
I will explain these points more in depth.<br>
<br>
Endor and Death Star 2 scouts are some of the best characters LS can play on ground, but there are some decks they simply donut fit in, I’m talking about Hidden Base, Massasi Base Operations, Echo Base Operations, and Watch Your Step archetypes. The other weak point they have is they are only really effective when they play together, so many decks simply passed over them and plays mains. But Rebel Strike Team (and even TIGIH) can use them in their whole potential as General Madine can be searched by Strike planning (a must in this deck), and he can search for one scout of ability &lt;3 per turn. But not only this, when you flip the objective you can retrieve 1 scout each of your move phases, so you will nearly always have one to search with Madine. Another good thing is that scouts deploy really cheap, the hardly never deploy for more than 3 force; even Chewie deploy for 3 in the rebel landing site.<br>
Every scout gives you some advantage in the game; Midge adds some force drain bonus for you, Brook Carlson allows you to move lots of scouts free with landspeed 2, etcetera; they all gives you something useful to play with. <br>
Also, once you’ve flipped the objective your scouts will all become immune to attrition &lt;3.<br>
<br>
And you have some of the best defensive interrupts of the game such as Insertion Planning, and Rebel Leadership (not as good as Imperial Command but very powerful) or the new Tatooine interrupts as Changing The Odds. These are cool interrupts with very high destiny that helps a lot in battles; with Insertion Planning + Changing The Odds your opponent total battle destiny is reduced by four &amp;#61514;.<br>
<br>
Now the bad news. Making a good and competitive RST deck is hard, very hard. There are lots of cards you need to add and only 60 Card slots to fill in, so you will find very difficult what to add or take out. You MUST play a minimum of 2 Explosive Charges and the guy who blows the bunker easier; Throw Me Another Charge might be a good addition as well. You need to defend your scouts so Rebel Barrier, Insertion Planning and so would be good cards too.<br>
If you play Luke (and you will) you have to defend him against duels (how I hate them) and Run Luke Run might be nice (for the good destiny and that you can move him to a battle at an adjacent site) or even some of the new Tatooine anti-duel cards would be fine.<br>
You must play a good amount of scouts, a standard deck would play between 8 and 12 different scouts. And you have to also play some mains to stand against the DS heavy characters as Mara, Vader, Darth Maul, etc.<br>
You play on exterior sites so you might want to protect your characters against AT-AT and AT-ST combat vehicles; Under Attack is a nice card against this, and a used interrupt also.<br>
Against Visage OOC/TT is very good and a recyclable high destiny interrupt just in case.<br>
And we can go on and on.<br>
What I am trying to explain with all this is that a new RST deck without space protection is running in Decktech and may become popular not very long. Why? Because of what I have said above space is really a weak point in this deck so many players (I do) plan their RST without starships. This might look like no good idea, but in many cases is better forget about playing in space (or ground) and concentrate your efforts where ever you are stronger at, even if this means you won’t be able to stop your opponent there. You must decide if you can have a fleet strong enough to stand against decks like SYCFA, TDIGWATT or even AOBS; if your answer is no, then try to make as more damage as you can down and forget about space. You will be able to do that if you play some defensive cards against drains in space like Control or Ultimatum.<br>
<br>
This article won’t be successfully finished if I don’t talk a little on the match-ups of this deck. I am going to explain some tactics against the most popular decks nowadays.<br>
RST has one particularity that nearly no other deck has; most of the time you will stay at Endor and wait your opponent there. If he is wise he will no go there as you can kick his a$$ hardly there, and you will have the chance to out drain him badly. I’m afraid RST is not a very interactive deck. Anyway, you will surely play Luke (and saber), Leia (and saber), Qui-Gon (and saber), etc. so you might want sometimes to go to your opponent. If so, remember you have plenty of nice defensive cards that can help you lot.<br>
<br>
OK, that was all. I hope you’ve enjoyed this. Any constructive criticism will be welcomed. By. <br>
