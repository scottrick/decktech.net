Im from Spain (Ithor region) and I hope I wont make too many mistakes.<br>
<br>
Is Reflection 2 going to give us any new really interesting cards to play with or is it going to be more of the same (the same as reflections I mean)?.<br>
The answer to this question is hard, I think it is yes... and no.<br>
<br>
I will explain my point of view in the next lines.<br>
Why yes?, becaurse the new expanded universe cards are very interesting. I know, I know, dark side cards are quite better than light side ones, but nobody can say they are not good enought to include some of them in nearlly all decks we play. Dark side cards increase the Empire level with such cards like Guri (a monster, isnt she?) that can @#$% a lot any light side deck, or like Snoova (a great new bounty hunter) or even like Guris ship in which she adds a battle destiny.<br>
Light side has his good cards too, like Corran Horn or Mirax Terrik, but they are not as good as dark cards.<br>
The combo cards will add a new estrategy vision of the game too; altough nearly every combo is less powerful than the individual cards, having (for example) Do or do not + wise advice in the same unique card (even if it has a 1 destiny), its a great thing, isnt it?<br>
Like the Do or do not/wise advice combo card, there are a lot of good ones (and no so good, like the Alter combo card that doesnt cancel sense, but the mains are quite good).<br>
<br>
Why no?, becaurse all the other cards (including the foil ones) are useless to nearly everyone who is not a collector. They are more of the same, or worse. Paying 5$ for pack with only 2 new cards is a bad thing for players.<br>
In a 18th cards pack all but the expanded universe and the combo card are previews ones. This might be a good thing to beginners, but not for oldies.<br>
<br>
I hope that for the next expansion set &quot;Skywalkers&quot; we will have plenty of new and exciting cards for a lower cards/price rate, I mean, a traditional cards expansion.<br>
