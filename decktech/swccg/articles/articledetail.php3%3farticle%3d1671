For many, it is a way of life. Winning is a must at all costs. You should start your journey in this cutthroat competitive game by copying some of the decks used by pros.  You can find these on many Star Wars web sites such as this one. However, building these decks will not be an easy task. Many of these decks use ultra rare cards like Jedi Luke and the Emperor.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at how you can get the hard to find cards and build a collection. First of all, go to the bank and take out a loan. Ten thousand should be good enough to start you off. Buy about five boxes of every expansion and enhanced set. This should give you most of the cards you need. If you need more copies of the ultra rares, you can easily get them for around fifty bucks from your local shop, or you can go online and win then for around thirty bucks if your lucky.Now make the decks.<br>
<br>
But a collection of five boxes of every set is not enough. One way you can enhance it is by making trades heavily in your favor. For example, if you see someone new who gets an Emperor in a pack and doesn't know the cards, you can trade him a Vader and Luke from the 2-Player game for the Emperor. When he asks why you're being so generous and trading him two mains for one, just say because he's a beginner and you happen to need the Emperor for your fifth set - otherwise everyone has the Emperor since he's so easy to get.<br>
<br>
Another way to enhance your collection is by running tournaments and charging an entrance fee for extra prize support. Just say you're gonna do picks and then open up all the packs while everyone else is busy playing. Keep the good cards for yourself and put some of your crappy rares in their place. But make sure that you leave for picks at least one good card each time so that nobody suspects anything. At the end say: &quot;Man, those were some bad packs. But at least somebody got the [good card you left in]&quot;. Don't forget that with Reflections packs you can keep any of the non-foil rares without even putting something crappy in their place!<br>
<br>
If you run tournaments, the prize support that you get for free can also be used to to enhance your collection. For example, if you had enough prize support to give each person three packs, you could only give them two packs (or even one) and then make them pay an entrance fee in order to do picks as described in the previous paragraph.<br>
<br>
Once you've built an impressice collection, it's time to show it off. Buy an expensive binder and take it with you to every tournament. Make sure you that at least half of the pages are full of mains. Also, make it noted to everyone that you only trade mains for mains. Many will drool over your collection and envy you since they know they don't have the cards to trade with you. And then someone will feel like they're up to it and trade you their mains. When this happens, always ask for more. Say stuff like &quot;what are you thinking&quot; or &quot;you crazy? nobody will do that&quot; in order to crush their confidence in their trading abilities. Your impressive binder will confirm that you know what you are talking about, furthermore crushing their self esteem. Afterwards they will be more than happy to trade you two mains for one, even if they are getting heavily ripped off.<br>
<br>
Before playing, you should a few days off to learn the every specific rule of the game. One way to do that is read the rulebook and then the glossary from front to back. Afterwards, take a few more days to practice with the decks you built. Your performance at the tournament should amount to nothing less than perfect.<br>
<br>
While playing, use the rules to your advantage. Be strict and never let your opponent go back. Take him word for word and catch him off guard. Doing otherwise is a sign of weakness. That's why you should spend a few days learning all the rules.<br>
<br>
You can also bend the rules to get maximum differentials and thus increase your ratings. For example, if you deployed Daughter from your hand and your opponent didn't say anything, go on and flip MWYHL when the time comes as if she was deployed from your reserve deck (you can't flip if Daughter is not deployed from your reserve deck for those that don't know, just check the online glossary at letter D if you don't believe it). Chances are your opponent will probably have forgotten about it or not even noticed it in the first place. In the unlikely event that your opponent does say something (maybe he kept quite to surprise you in the end?), just say that's not how it happened. Say that she was deployed from your reserve deck. It's your word against your opponent's. It happened way back in the beginning of the game and your opponents was probably confused since you did deploy Yoda from your hand but not Daughter. The TD will always rule in your favor unless he doesn't like you (well, maybe now that I mentioned this as an example some TDs might rule otherwise).<br>
<br>
Another example of bending the rules for a maximum differential is playing fast. You can take multiple actions quickly before your opponent realizes he has that grapper card in his hand or another counter card to your action. If one or more actions have taken place since then, it's too late for your opponent to do anything about it. These are official tournament rules. Again, always in your favor unless the TD is crooked or he doesn't know the rules. Furthermore, you can also benefit when your opponent is playing fast. For example, if he just force drained you for 7, lose 6 or 5 instead. While he's busy working on his strategy he won't notice, especially if he hasn't been counting your lost pile since in Star Wars you can't look at the lost pile (only the top card).<br>
<br>
Using the rules to your advantage will get you a higher differential, but creating rules will let get you even higher differentials. For example, if your opponent is new and he doesn't look like he's gonna jump to the TD, one rule you can make up is that spies can deploy on Dagobah. If multiple actions have taken place afterwards, even if he goes to the TD nothing can be done!<br>
<br>
While playing, it is also helpful to crush your opponent's confidence. Dropping a Vader accidentaly from your hand early on can help. Saying things like &quot;are you sure&quot; or &quot;I wouldn't do that - think about [some card you might not even have in your deck]&quot; are also beneficial. But these are just examples. If you want, just get your buddies to watch the game and win with sheer intimidation! Show your opponent who's boss and drive him away. There ain't no place for sissies!<br>
<br>
If you keep this up, you should win tournaments and get that 2000+ rating very quickly. Drive the weak away and pound on the strong! Win at all costs! If it so happens that you've drive away most of the people in your area from the game and you can't seem to get eight people anymore, keep on posting those tournaments. When nobody shows up, make a fake tournament. Get the prize. Get more ratings. Then go to a different area and pound away there too. Show everyone that you're the best!<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, I hope that by now most of you realized that this was a sarcastic view on how some players are (well, maybe not this extreme). They drive people away from the game and in the end nobody profits. The beginners are gone and the master has nobody to beat on anymore. Let's not let this happens to Star Wars. It's the greatest CCG out there and we should not let it end like this. More and more people are quitting everyday and the beginners are getting fewer and fewer. While the numerous expansions influence this, we the players can turn the tide around. Make the effort and help new people get into the game.<br>
<br>
Most articles on this topic say not to do the stuff described above. This article says the same thing but in a sarcastic way which gets your attention. That's what this has been meant to do - get your attention. Most people look at the &quot;keep star wars alive&quot; articles for a few seconds and then give them a 1 star, never actually reading the whole article and in this way ignoring the problem. That can happen since there is a lack of interest and thus the reader never gets into the article. But the way that this article was written in the beginning (at first 99% of you probably thought I really meant some of that stuff) got you the players outraged and this way got your attention at the problem. Give this less than a 4 only if you want the game to end. Give it a 5 if you agree with me that there is an impending problem and something has to be done. Remember this was meant to get your attention. That's first step in making the game new again and putting an end to the end of the game. I also hope it made you laugh a few times towards the end when you realized it was sarcastic. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1671"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1671"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1671" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
