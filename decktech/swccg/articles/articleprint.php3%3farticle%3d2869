Somehow, for some reason, it just seems less interesting playing against the same decks for what must be the umpteenth time. Why is no one in your playgroup a Steven Lewis or T.J. Holman, coming out of leftfield with wild deck designs that WIN? Why does it seem that everyone plays the same decks that you&#146;ve read about on DeckTech for the past month? Probably because they do...<br>
<br>
How do you add spice to the game, then? Play something different, yourself, for starters. That doesn&#146;t mean that, suddenly, you&#146;re going to try to feed everyone to the Rancor or give up on winning entirely, but, with a keen eye to what people in your area are playing, you can find a way to sneak in a brilliant new deck and win.<br>
<br>
And sometimes... the best new decks are the older ones. With a couple of changes. There&#146;s an old saying: &quot;There&#146;s nothing new under the sun.&quot; And, for the most part, that&#146;s true in Star Wars, too--at least half a month after the latest set appears; most of the secrets will be out of the box. Then you watch as a hundred variations of 10 or 15 cards different get posted on DeckTech as brand new takes on a familiar (all too familiar) archetype. But it&#146;s also possible to delver further into the past for your archetype and dig up something that no one can expect.<br>
<br>
The idea of the deck &quot;archetype&quot; is that it was good enough to spawn a number of clones and good enough that, at one point, people had to be prepared to face a deck of that type. Star Wars, with its magic bullets, will kill an archetype with just a card or two, but when players stop fearing the deck archetype, they stop playing those cards... Then the deck type might be good again.<br>
<br>
Examples: After third anthology came out, and again after Jabba&#146;s Sealed, I built Dark Side Jabba&#146;s Palace manipulators. One version was complete with the starting Expand the Empire to fetch all my Jabba&#146;s Palace sites, Mi&#146;yoom Onith, Scanning Crews, Monnoks, Ability x3, the whole nine yards. And, of course, the deck won. Why? It was always a solid deck to begin with, but people started countering it by playing Throne Room and Shocking Information. Those cards were seeing less play at that time, and I felt that Jabba&#146;s Palace manipulators were once again strong enough to use.<br>
<br>
Another example: Just now figuring out how to get back into the tournament scene with a win or two (after getting rusty over the past several months), I decided that the Light Side was all about winning the podrace or somehow dealing with the damage--the obvious solution being It Could Be Worse. I don&#146;t like podracing, myself, so I decided I&#146;d try the It Could Be Worse route and looked at different deck types: Hidden Base flip, Hidden Mains, Dagobah, etc. None of them really seemed to work. Then I realized that if I was so worried about podracing, I shouldn&#146;t worry about facing 3 starting effects every game. In fact, the whole scene around starting effects was changing, and I felt that suddenly Throne Room/Revo/Nudj&#146;s would work again. To make a longer story short, I just whipped together a fairly basic Throne Room/Revo/Nudj deck for my last tournament and won handily with it. No one was really expecting a similar deck, so it worked. Qui-Gon also proved to be an invaluable addition to the deck.<br>
<br>
This is how cards like How Did We Get Into This Mess? wax and wane in popularity... depending upon the popularity of their counters. Take a good look at your playgroup. You&#146;ll probably find that counters to many strong decks are fading away as other decks become predominant. By choosing to play a solid deck an era or two older than anyone is meta-gaming against, you could end up winning with a deck that doesn&#146;t put everyone to sleep.<br>
<br>
What are some viable options, then?<br>
<br>
How about ISB dump and drain with Sunsdown? The new Coruscant effect that allows you to activate during your opponent&#146;s turn if you occupy a battleground will prove invaluable as you can Ghhhk away from a beatdown. WYS can&#146;t handle the drains. Nothing can.<br>
<br>
For that matter... How prepared for Agents is anyone in your area? No Escape is still a popular dark side card, but how often do you see Ounee Ta? If you don&#146;t see it often, you might try Dark agents.<br>
<br>
Better, though, is RalOps if Ounee Ta is dead. RalOps was hindered by Don&#146;t Do That Again since activation went out the window, but RalOps was good before Mob Points and it can be good without it. Twix locations and Neimodian Advisors can help set up the deck quickly. Come Here You Big Coward can protect your Twix locations as well as slow down podrace retrieval.<br>
<br>
Someone apparantly won games with a Rescue the Princess deck. I don&#146;t know how, but I read about it in someone else&#146;s tournament report. Go figure. That might be something &quot;crazy enough that it just might work.&quot; If people aren&#146;t playing Secret Plans consistently in your area, it&#146;s hard to beat the retrieval from Death Star Plans. In combination, suiciding your EPP mains and then retrieving them while your opponent&#146;s characters go out of play will eventually lead to your total control of the game.<br>
<br>
What about SAC? SAC is back. Light Side can go with a variant of the Pile or Throne Room while Dark Side has the Desert Landing Site/Jabba&#146;s Palace start. SAC heavy variants can trip up opponent&#146;s who don&#146;t start the SAC counters. Honor of the Jedi is a must for Light Side SAC.<br>
<br>
There are plenty more options, too. That&#146;s the beauty of it, really. Were I to list them all, people might be prepared for the deck you dredge up out of the past, a skeletal dinosaur brought back to terrorize your local playgroup. But all you need to do is consider what your playgroup is currently using (and what it might use), and then variety can be yours. Consider all the decks that you might know how to use or even those you&#146;ve wanted to play but haven&#146;t--if they&#146;re capable of dealing with the popular decks that you&#146;re seeing, and you don&#146;t expect a counter for, say, the Cantina Shuffle, then go ahead and try it out. You&#146;ll have a good chance of catching everyone with their meta-pants down, and you probably won&#146;t be the only person who appreciates the variety you bring to the environment.<br>
