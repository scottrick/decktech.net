<br>
Whatever you want you deck to be, Objective or not, you wont want it to be pathetically weak vs. any deck type. If that deck type its weak against suddenly becomes popular in your area, you could find yourself in a load of trouble. Try to pick a deck with a balanced amount of strengths and weaknesses, with weaknesses that can be easily countered and strengths that can be easliy accessed. A good example of the above is the Hunt Down objective, with easily accessed strengths on the flipped side, and weaknesses such as HB and Ops that can be easily countered.<br>
<br>
<br>
STEP 2: Picking one to your play style<br>
<br>
Youll want your deck to allow to to feel comfortable when using it. If you like to drain during your drains, dont pick Objectives that halt your drains, such as Quiet Mining Colony and Rebel Strike Team. If battling's your thing, Profit and Hunt Down may be right up your alley. Whatever you like to do during your normal games, make sure your deck helps that out, not make it a pain to accomplish. If you dont like Objectives, dont play one. Dont make it a hassle for yourself come game time.<br>
<br>
<br>
STEP 3: Picking out cards for your new deck<br>
<br>
Once you have one established that youre comfortable with, look through your collection for any and all cards youll need to help make that deck work to its best. some cards are obvious, others not so obvious. For example, for a Profit Deck, obviously Master Luke, Someone Who Loves You, and I Must Be Allowed to Speak work great w/ it, but other cards, such as Mandalorian Mishap, Order to Engage, and Anger, Fear, Aggression can work wonders for it as well. Look through your entire collection for cards that even remotely work with it, and begin your deck construction.<br>
<br>
<br>
STEP 4: Improvising<br>
<br>
This isnt really a step to help find your deck type, but alot of times it will be necassary. After sorting through your collection, you may find that you are missing alot of cards you need for your deck. This is when you need to take a long, hard look and see whether you can make your deck or not. There is always a possibility, so dont give up, improvise. If you dont have enough Master Lukes as you desire for your Profit Deck, consider using EPP Luke, which in many ways can be just as powerful. If you dont have enough SE Vaders for your Hunt Down, EPP Vader may be a nice second alternative. If the cards you improvised with just arent doing the job, then youll need to find the cards you need to make your new deck. Trading is a nice way to do this, but sometimes just going out and buying it is much better. If none of these options are viable to you, then youll probaly need to pick another deck type and go back to STEP 1 above. Sometimes this will happen, but dont get discouraged and just go pick something else out that can also suit your playing style.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I hope this has helped someone, if anyone, in finding thier new deck. This is NOT an article on how to build a deck, so dont review it as that. Thanks.<br>
