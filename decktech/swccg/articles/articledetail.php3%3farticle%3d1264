<br>
Deck Repair 101<br>
This is by no means an cure-all for bad decks.	However, if you look at the top deckbuilders,  many of their decks have certain things in common.  If you run your deck through this checklist and make the appropriate corrections to your deck, you'll find that you have a much better deck.  Without further delay, the list<br>
<br>
50 ways to lose your lover (or 10 ways to test your deck)<br>
<br>
#1 Destiny-  this is obvious, but it's not as easy finding the average destiny.  To get a rough estimate, take out all the cards that you know you will never draw for destiny, including starting stuff and cards like Yoda in MWYHL and diamond locations in ROps, and then average your destiny.  Also, see how consistent your destiny is.  ROps has many 3's and 4's while Hunt Down has many 1's and 6's.  If you count on blind luck alot, go with the Rops deck because many of it's cards have similar destinies, where Hunt Down decks are unpredictable in that you can either draw high or low, but never average.  Also, games that go down to the wire are almost always won by the player that can track destinies better.  How many destiny 4+ used interupts (that can be played almost anytime) do you have?  Having a few of these is very helpful at the end of close games.	Reactor Terminal is a great card in that it can make any card easily recyclable, so near the end of the game, almost all of your reserve deck is destiny 4+.  Although not nessecary, cards like Broken Concentration and Bith shuffle eliminate your opponent's ability to track destinies.  This can be a huge advantage.  I still think Bith Shuffle is one of the best anti-dueling cards around.	Most DS players won't duel unless they've stacked destinies.<br>
<br>
#2 Draw Dependency- Any good deck has a game plan or some method that allows it to gain an edge.  How efficently does you deck get the nessecary cards needed to carry out it's plan.	MWYHL decks are strong in this category because everything it needs to Jedi test can be pulled from the reserve deck.  The reason I hate Profit is because it doesn't really give you anything to help free han and you can't pull anything from reserve.  You need to draw everything you need for Profit decks.  Also, if a certain card (Savrip, Tank, and OtEngage) screws you deck over, do you have access to the magic bullet (MM, Shut Him Up..., Point Man) at anytime during the game.  There are many cards and strategies that have an counter to them, can your deck get to them without having a 40 card hand?<br>
<br>
#3 Early game activation- along with draw dependency, your early game activation determines how well your deck develops.  In short, there are three stages to almost every game, setup of game plan, implementation of game plan, and the collapse of the game plan (see next section).  Whoever activate more in the first 3-5 turns can usually proceed to the mid game faster.  If you have your game plan setup before your opponent (ex. you Jedi test before they flip Rops), you can focus more on disrupting your opponents game plan because you have already setup.  Let's face it, the Rops player has nothing going for them (except +4 deploy for opposing mains to Raltiir) until it flips.  If the LS gets their game plan going (and gains their edge, let's say JT#2), they have an advantage in battles while the Rops player is still trying to flip.  Without an early activation advantage, you can't implement your game plan faster.	Operatives gets an activation advantage because everything in the deck is cheap, therefore, it uses their force much more effectively than other decks.  To make this better, count the total amount of force you activate/give away and see how you can improve it.<br>
<br>
#4 Mid-late game activation- If both players have the same size reserve deck, the player that can activate their entire reserve deck faster win win the majority of the games.	The reason, 1 Shocking Info can be drawn for destiny 5 or 6 times in the late game.  In all games, one or both players' game plan collapses or is no longer effective.  If one player doesn't have anything going for them (their game plan collapsed) and the other player still has his game plan intact, the second player will always win.  In many games, both players game plan collapses because both reserve decks have been depleted and neither player has enough active force to maintain his mid-game strategy.  This is when recycling destinies are vital because much of the game involves picking and choosing battles.  In the end game, you have to conserve what you have.  In close games, how many of your characters/lost interupts/effects have a game changing effect.  You have limited force to use/draw so everyone is extremely important.  Figurin D'an is a horrible late game card because he uses up at least 4 active force everytime you use him.	Descent into the dark was the greatest end game card until it got errated because it allowed you to draw the same destiny multiple time and it eliminated the used pile.<br>
<br>
#5 Road bumps-	these include all cards that either make your cards more efficent or your opponent's cards less efficent.  Scum and Villany + SE Jabba makes your ORS very broken.  ORS weren't meant to be deploy 0 forfeit 5.  Any card that makes many of your other cards better is an excellent addition.  The majority or cards in print are very balanced, but a number of cards make them much better.  OtEngage makes yoda's gimer stick alot better.  BFHI and ROps makes opposing mains much worse.  People don't put DOSkywalker in Throne room decks because she isn't very efficent.  All Profit decks should have many Massa Luke's because it's hard to pass up a free character that is as powerful as Luke.  Secret Plans and Battle Plan are also good road bumps because they make action that are normally free cost force.  Every force your opponent uses means one less card in their hand at the end of the turn, which means one less threat they can use against you.<br>
<br>
#6 Know your role- I hate 'professional' wresting but I think the phrase fits.  Design your deck either to be aggressive and force the opponent to come to you (effective for a any deck that gets bonuses on it's home turf ) or a reactive deck.  Don't try to make your TR deck a drain deck, it won't work.  If your draining, you're probably giving up icons, and if you're battling, you shouldn't be giving up too many icons.	If you're acting, make sure you have some reason why you want the opponent to come to you (Speeder Ops drains until the DS comes to stop the drain, and then it beats them down with flapped speeders)<br>
<br>
#7 Your lost pile after 4 turns- At all costs, keep cards out of your lost pile in the first few turns unless absolutely nessecary (exception: Tunnel Vision, an excellent mains card).  You don't want to implement your game plan with a wounded leg.  Hunt Down deck are good because they cause early force loss (Transmission Terminated is popular because of this even though TT is one of the least versatile cards around).  If you can cause early damage without hurting yourself, by all means, go for it.  You can often get in a few early drains before your opponent gets setup.  One card stop to almost all early drains: Battle Plan/Order.<br>
<br>
#8 Force loss/turn- how fast is your reserve deck decreasing?  If your deck decreases faster than your opponents, you're losing the game.  I don't care if you beat up my operative for 8 overflow as long as I'm outdamaging you.  If you have a drain of 2 going and 2 profit damage and I have a drain of 7 going plus retrival for deploying ops, I don't care if you get a one time big damage battle in.  I can makeup that 8 force loss real quick.	Like wise, it's well worth losing 3 force once with Tibrin to retrieve that Transmission Terminated so I can kill the Visage that is eating me for 2 a turn.  Even semi-consistent stuff like Sabaac and OtEngage can count toward your total damage loss.  Also, celebrating for 2 a turn is as good as Uncle Furying for 2.	If you're doing less damage, your first priority is to get back to parity or even gain an advantage.  Also, don't worry about Vader draining for 2 on Endor if you can put Luke on Tatooine and drain for 1, Profit for 1, and celebrate for 1.  You'll win the game unless the DS does soemthing to change that setup.<br>
<br>
#9 Deadweight- you want everyone of your cards to have maximum value against a maximum amount of decks.  For this reason, I'd much rather use spies than Transmission Terminated in Hunt Down decks.  On the other hand, Shocking Info is almost always useful as a recycler, and it's the bomb against SCrews and Fustration.  It's often nessecary to include magic bullets (like CoaS in a deck that is Luke/Ben dependent), but try not to have more than 5 useless cards in any game.  Remember, no high destiny cards is dead weight with Traffic Control.<br>
<br>
#10 Suprise Value- Your opponent is holding a bunch of square pegs.  Don't give him a board full of square holes.  Give him the board that he doesn't have a peg for.  In other words, if your opponent has CHYBC on the table, don't try to invade his twix locations.  Much of this is done in deckbuilding.  Even though Savrip, Bacta Tank, Revo, and OtEngage might be the best LS effects around, don't rely on those because you know the magic bullets are everywhere.  Don't rely on multiples of one interupt because it will get grabbed.  Never play testbook of any deck because people will expect it.  Also, try and overload his counters.  Play the holotable in your Hunt Down to overwork his TT.  Play Scramble and OtEngage to overload his point man.  Play Effective Repairs and grabbers to overload anything you want.  Don't play stuff that will maximize his card's effectiveness.  Never play Clash in your Revo deck, his Crush will be ultra effective.  Play something that can't easily be dealt with (Ominous Rumors, Profit Damage, etc).  Also, maximize the effectiveness of your cards.  path of least resistance can be used both to avoid a beatdown and apply one.  Be able to use the lost function of Don't forget the Droids.  That last part goes with dead weight as well it is still important to throw as many different weapons as you can.  If you have anything that your opponent can't deal with, they will have to rethink their strategy to work around it.  Also, don't over metagame because you will end up losing to a Dagobah Clouds deck after destroying a Profit and TR mains.  Never play a textbook deck.<br>
<br>
Some decks do well by violating some of these guidlines (operatives break many of these), but the majority of decks should try to follow as many of these as they can without disrupting their deck too much.  If you have to change a whole bunch of cards to follow these guidlines, either you have some overwhelming factor in your favor that allows you to ignore one or more of these or you need to scrap the deck.  Many of my decks that were bad because they couldn't compete with tougher decks.	I have a deck that doesn't follow these guidlines.  I am Appalachian state.  I am playing a deck that doesn't follow these guildlines.  I am playing Duke in basketball.  I might have some secret weapon (like Duke's overconfidence) but the odds are I will lose. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1264"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1264"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1264" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
