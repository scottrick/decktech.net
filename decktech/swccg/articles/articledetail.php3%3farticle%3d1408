Long article ahead!<br>
	Mixing space and ground seems to be on of Decipher's pet ideas. It's pretty obvious in light of certain cards: celebrations/occupations, Battle Order, Imperial Decree, and even the new DSII cards (why else would you make That Thing Operational?) But where this tendency reaches its peak is what I will refer to as the Base archetype, because conceptually it revolves around your side establishing a base to rule space. You will see one in a tournament. Old Schoolers may remember EBO, which is now at once the oldest and newest example of the decktype. Most of you have seen Endor Ops at one time or another, and Third Anthology gives yet two more examples: Massassi Base Operations and Set Your Course For Alderaan.<br>
	All of these decks have certain advantages and disadvantages in common. The main advantage is DRAINS. While the advantages differ (and discussed in greater detail later), all of these decks add 2 to drains at systems. Even moderate systems become drains for 3, and LS Kessel and Coruscant become monster drains of 5. Not even Dark Deal can compete.<br>
	They also provide some form of ground protection, which is meant to make defending your home base easier. Not all are created equal. And they also provide various other benefits in space in addition to pumped drains. Finally, they lend themselves well to the cards that encourage you to mix ground and space, which is going to be an even bigger advantage in D*II.<br>
	Of course, the Base archetype is not without its disadvantages. Most critically, it's extremely card intensive. It requries you to have relatively strong ground and strong space--something many players think you should never, EVER do in a 60 card deck. Although the ground help eases the burden, you do run the risk of being beaten by a dedicated space deck; sometimes, though, the benefits from your Base even the odds.<br>
	Now that the number of viable Base type decks has ballooned to four, I think it will be necessary to compare them in several key areas:<br>
	Staple Cards are card no needed to use the objective but make it much easier and better. Most of my discussion presumes use of these cards (if you want to run Endor Ops without Perimeter Patrol, that's your funeral).<br>
	Setting Up Base covers what you need to do to get your benefit. The rating here is how fast and easy this is (1-10, 10 being easiest)<br>
	Defense Perimeter covers what makes it easier to defend, with higher ratings being more effective. This does include cards listed under Staple<br>
	The Fleet is Ready covers your best ship choices; the rating is based on what I believe works best with the deck.<br>
	Conquer the Universe Covers the benefits of the deck besides your pumped drains. IMO, potentially the most important rating.<br>
	Finally, I give an average of all ratings.<br>
	And I'm not going to do anything crackheaded with these decks; no CPI manipulator here, this is going to be straight up build and drain.<br>
	First, there's the original:<br>
Echo Base Operations<br>
Staple Cards: A New Secret Base, Echo Base Garrison, Incom (if X-Wing)<br>
Setting Up Base: Occupy three Echo sites. You can pull the sites and Effect with ANSB, and the guys with EBG. (Who hasn't seen this deck yet?) All in all, wicked fast and easy.<br>
Trav's Rating: 10<br>
Defense Perimeter: The Hoth Energy Shield; your opponent can only deploy to the outermost marker. You can stick a big welcome party, but that just gives up the best benefit. They can't beat you down and they can't reinforce. They can't Nabrun or DB over. Still, they can sit and build up a few turns and then march in. Trav's Rating: 7<br>
The Fleet is Ready: No S-Foils, so B-wings and X-wings appear to be at a loss, bu X-Wings get Incom. Since they deploy cheap with EBO around, they're your best bet, along with some bigger ships like the leaders, Falcon, and Artoo in Red 5. Of course, the DS is ready for this. Trav's Rating: 8<br>
Conquer the Universe: Deploy Bonus and Power Bonus. Deploy lets the ships fly from your hand and power helps expand (Gold Leader alone gets 7 power+destiny, the same as Boba) ANSB lets you pull systems, but not the biggest LS drain systems. IMO, you're better off getting three drains of three on the table than one of five in most situations. Trav's Rating: 6 (good benefits, but wait'll you see the others)<br>
Average for EBO: 7.75<br>
And now from EBO we go to the nemesis of EBO: Endor Ops.<br>
I assume flipping here, but you a good Endor Ops deck can slap down Rumors and drain without having to wait for the flip.<br>
<br>
Endor Operations<br>
Staple Cards: Ephant Mon, Perimeter Patrol, AT-STs and Biker scouts (about 8-10 for flip), Navy Trooper Fenson, Return to Base<br>
Setting Up Base: You can only pull your two effects; can't pull sites or systems. Still, you can put down Rumors right away. Setting up Establish Secret Base, though, take more time. I include both sides in Trav's Rating of 7.<br>
Defense Perimeter: Perimeter patrol is so nasty many people won't even deploy. They can't move or battle for a turn, and they LOSE FORCE. Fenson adds to deploy; with Bad Feeling, no one comes to Endor. The DB is out, but expensive for the LS. Pack Nabrun protection. Trav's Rating: 8<br>
The Fleet is Ready: Any ship gets the bonus. The Enhanced Bounty Hunter Ships are, pre D*2, the most powerful ships in the game, and these are your best bet, backed by favorites like Bossk, Executor, and Dreadnaughts. The EBH ships are cheap enough you can realistically use Return to Base to keep them around. Trav's Rating: 10<br>
Conquer the Universe: Crappy immunity for your AT-STs, Biker scout retrieval, and your opponent may draw only one battle destiny. It's unlikely you'll have room to pack enough Scouts for the retrieval to matter. The battle destiny reduction can be gamebreaking against some decks and worthless against others. Also, your drains at Endor sites get some protection; significantly, this is the only Base that gives you any real drain potential on its own--there are four sites on Endor you can drain for two at, although one requires a Yuzzum and the other is the Back Door, which you probably shouldn't run. Given the meta (a lean away from multi-destiny madness), this receives a Trav's Rating of 6.<br>
Average Rating for Endor Ops: 7.75 (no, I didn't plan for it to come out the same)<br>
<br>
Endor Ops is, conceptually, the Imperial Base built to construct the second Death Star, so now I turn to the Third Anthology objective based around the first: Set Your Course for Alderaan.<br>
CPI<br>
Staple Cards: Hoth, Yavin, CPI in multiple, A Day Long Remembered, Ability, Ability, Ability,<br>
Setting Up Base: You have to blow up Alderaan. You can grab the stuff for it, but getting CPI working reliably takes some time.Trav's Rating: 5<br>
Perimeter Defense: The Death Star, appropriately, has some truly nasty defense. The Docking bay is out, but there's people who keep them from using it. Revolution, the Bane of the Bunker, is canceled. Finally, YOU DON'T TAKE BATTLE DAMAGE ON THE DEATH STAR. If you opponent nabruns six mains and draws twenty destiny on your lone Gunner, he just kills your gunner. Trav's Rating: 10<br>
The Fleet is Ready: Star Destroyers. You could, in theory, support them with EBH ships, but since your SDs get killed and you need lots of cards for CPI your best bet is straight SDs, which have problems with Immunity and ability. If this gets popular, the Intruder Missiles are coming out. Trav's Rating: 6 (I'm an SD fan, but this strat is killed if the SDs go down)<br>
Conquer the Universe: COMMENCE PRIMARY IGNITION. You can blow up Hoth, Yavin, or the Operative planet. Think of the number of strategies this just kills: Throne Room, MBO, EBO, RTP, Hoth cheez, Speeder Ops. And the Yavin strategies take heavy damage; your typical Throne Room start has 19 damage coming its way! It's a race against MBO, though. Oh, and you get a deploy bonus for those pricy SDs and you can pull you systems. With A Day Long Remembered, they have to deal with +8 deploy; nasty in conjunction with Abilityx3, especially if you just blew away lots of cards with ability. Most people simply draw up at this point. And Revo stays dead. Trav's Rating: 10<br>
Average: 7.75. I didn't plan this one either; I hope you still find this useful if they come out the same. At this point I might actually adjust MBO =), which is up next.<br>
<br>
Massassi Base Operations<br>
Staple Cards: Attack Run Stuff, Down with the Emporer, Civil Disorder, Goo Nee Tay (moreso than elsewhere),<br>
Setting Up Base: Blowing up the Death Star is tougher than blowing up Alderaan--and you need to control three Yavin sites before you can get on with that. It takes longer to blow up the Death Star than Alderaan, flip Endor Ops to say nothing of EBO or Rumors. Trav's Rating: 2<br>
Defense Perimeter: If you start Goo Nee Tay, the DS faces some pretty hefty deploy for Imperials of Ability&gt;3. It seems RallOps esque until one realizes that the DS uses more small characters, more aliens, and more combat vehicles. And the docking bay starts out. Trav's Rating: 3.<br>
The Fleet is Ready: To get the benefit, you need PILOTs on those ships, so no MBOX. Y-Wings and Corvettes are the most straightforward. This seems to lend itself to the SE pilots, but that's still hard to pull off in a Card intensive deck in the beginning. D*2, with Squadron Assignments, will make this deck much better. Trav's Rating: 5, 10 after D*2<br>
Conquer the Universe: Your opponent will lose 12 force for the destruction of the Death Star if he has no locations, which helps make up for lost draining time. Down with the Empire with Civil Disorder is still nasty. Oh, and you keep your bonus even if your opponent controls all of Yavin, even if Yavin's blown away. You also get a power bonus like EBO's. Rating: 8<br>
Average: 4.5. And I kind of like MBO. Wait until Death Star II to put this deck togethor.Maybe some Yavin Sentries and Grandorn Muse will help (I don't include them because I didn't include other sentries). I give the deck an average rating of about 6 with these included. The deck's main achilles heel: The length of time necessary to blow up the Death Star, with most people guessing turn 8 or 9. The benefits are above average, but some tech is needed to get Attack Run done fast. The deck needs to exist longer for more innovation to take place; someone started Echo Base Garrison to get the guys to flip (if you're reading, take credit in the review). I vote MBO the deck that will benefit most from D*2, especially since Admiral's Orders encourage you to have characters on ships.<br>
Thanks for reading this huge thing. I'd be happy to take any messages for input on my next article on how to beat these decks, which is of concern because they will rise in the meta--just look how many EBO decks are posted.<br>
