Many people are upset about this, as am I, and many are postulating theories about the real intent of Decipher.<br>
<br>
Before us lie two paths, two ways in which we determine the future of this sub-society known as SWCCG gamers. We can blame decipher, we can get angry, we can have ideas about why this is happening. But heres what really matters: Do we simply accept that there will be no championships, quit playing (as many are doing), and resign ourselves to the duldrums of inactivity or boredom, or simply not caring saying F!ck off to the Big D. OR, we can do something about it. <br>
<br>
If we decide to do nothing about it, I greatly fear the end of the game. There is so much hype about DecipherCon; it is the land of plenty, it is the end all and be all of star wars. It is the moment all players who are competitive work towards all year long. Without this activity taking place, without this highest level of competition, I fear that many of the better players (myself included) will simply leave the scene, whether quietly losing interest in competition that no longer matters or raging about it online and quiting in a grand exit.<br>
<br>
There is a second, harder road. We can hold our own championships. Things happened similarly in the Roman Catholic Church at one time. A pope was elected that most of the rest of the world did not approve of, and the rest of the world did not stand for it: the elected a new pope. Similarly we are faced with a challenge. We can say &#146;fine&#146; to decipher, and organize our own championships. We have the capabilities, thanks to DeckTeck, to hold major tournaments, and to give away cash prizes. There is a huge step up involved in going between running DPCs and running a World Class comptitor event. It would take lots and lots and lots of work to accomplish, but I believe that it would be feasable. For there to be a large future for SWCCG, or much of a competitive future, at any rate, we need to act, in order to save something that has become the life blood of many of us.<br>
<br>
If we simply stop now, and accept the loss of the Con, I fear that there will be little future for competitive SWCCG playing. For most of us here, this is and has been a major facet of our lives for a very very very long time. I&#146;ve been playing for 6 years now, and I truely love this game. I have devoted more time to it this year than ever before, not to win some money, but to make friends, to improve my game, and to maybe be considered among the best. I started this year at around 1712 rating, and now it will be 1950&#146;s after the next update, and is still climbing. After you spend a long time completely devoted to a cause, and it disappears, you get discouraged. I know this is the case for many players. However, we must NOT go silently into the night, we must Not go down without a fight, we MUST rise to the challenge, and show the people in charge that we want and mean to have the competition. I am whole heartedly in favor of donating the money to the 9-11 fund. If I won, that was my plan anyway. The money is not the important thing here, folks. <br>
<br>
What is important is that we strike at this together, and overcome diversity, and hold our championships. Whether it be Star Wars, or Star Trek, or whatever, players in any field of sport need that ultimate level of competition, else all is for nought. And even more than competition, is the sense of fellowship. I don&#146;t mean anything religious by that (I&#146;m Agnostic), but I mean it in the literal sense. People need a group to belong to, a group of similar ideology, similar intellect, similar joke base, all of that. Well, like it or not, most of us have those similarities. This is what I mean by fellowship. This is something that means far more to many of us than winning or even money. This is why most of us pay the money and play. We enjoy the game first, but we also tend to enjoy the people.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are at a crossroads. We need to decide, and soon, what the verdict will be. Will we let the championships be cancelled, or will we make some small effort to ensure that we get to see our friends, get to compete with the best, get to test our mettle. This is an individual decision, but it is also a joint one. While we each must decide for ourselves where to go from here, we must also decide together if there will be anywhere to go to.<br>
