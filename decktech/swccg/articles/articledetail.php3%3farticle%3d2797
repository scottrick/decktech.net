For those of you who took offence at my little stab at Condit, I really meant he&#146;s a House Rep, not a Senator... ya thats what I meant. Anyways I&#146;ve looked over the reviews of my LS Senate Article (Wow&#146;s Politics 101: THE Definitive Guide To LS Politics), and taken into account what you&#146;d like changed. I had considered changing the format because alot of you didn&#146;t want to hear reviews for each of the cards. However, if you just scroll down a bit you&#146;ll notice where they end (It&#146;s where I talk alot in big paragraphs). I&#146;ve expanded a bit on deck ideas + cards to add because thats what people want. The cheat sheet is back too. Enjoy yourself, and remember to review it.<br>
<br>
Let me just say, I don&#146;t believe in submitting any article that is less than my standard. I believe every article on decktech should be WORTHWHILE and INFORMATIVE. I like to joke around a little bit during the article, but that&#146;s my style, please don&#146;t take offense. I also have a tendency to write things in CAPS when I FEEL THEY ARE IMPORTANT. I wish I could Bold, Underline, Etc but I don&#146;t feel like getting them &amp;8531;s. You know what I mean. Anyways, I feel that this article is 110% of effort and work, and that all articles should try and meet this standard. This article looks at DS Politcs (Cards, Deck Ideas), Comparisions To LS Politics, and Uses for Non-Political Cards in A Senate Deck. All of these meet what I consider the strict standard for good decktech writing. My only slump is in spelling/grammer since I write these in notepad to avoid numerous annoyances, so I can&#146;t check them very well.<br>
<br>
It also should be noted, this article is almost twice the length (meaning basicaly 2x non-card review stuff) of the LS Senate article. That article can be found here:<br>
<br>
http://www.decktech.net/swccg/articles/articledetail.php3?article=2670<br>
<br>
Again, special thanks to the Courscant Spoilers which can be found here on decktech that gave me the text for the cards!!! Also, to the three dudes who made the best 3 senate decks on Decktech!!!<br>
<br>
I) Political Cards<br>
(Each Card Reviewed, Go To III For Deck Ideas)<br>
<br>
Section 1: The Two Big Ones<br>
<br>
My Lord, Is That Legal? / I Will Make It Legal <br>
Destiny 0 <br>
DARK SIDE Objective [U] <br>
Side 0 Text: Deploy Galactic Senate and any other [Episode 1] location. <br>
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability &lt; 4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. Your Republic characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay. Cards on your Political Effects may deploy to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. <br>
Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least 1 with a blockade agenda) at Galactic Senate. <br>
Side 7 Text: While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponent&#146;s hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (or +3 if senator has an ambition agenda) when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. May use 2 Force at end of any turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. <br>
Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The Objective, what else is there to say. You get the added bonus of Imp + Rebel leaders being politics +2 if they are &lt;4 abiltiy. Counter Assualt stoppage is nice, Goo Nee Tay immunity is good for a few of your characters. The two key parts on the &quot;For&quot; part of the text is -6 weapons which is extremely helpfull against weapons and no game text on non-republic characters, which means, Maul, Rebels, Imperials and Aliens all have no say in the senate. Flipping is not that difficult, if you have 2 senators and 1 with a blockade agenda. However as you may notice, only 3 characters have a blockade agenda, Lott Dod, Ask Moe (both are rares), and Baskol Yeesrim, who is useless in non-Naboo decks. After you flip, let the brokenness begin. 3 Force to make 2 cards go used. Hmm, what card works well with small hands? Limited Resources. More on that later. Also you can now track your senators you put on politcal effects through your deck to use again.<br>
<br>
*Coruscant: Galactic Senate <br>
DARK SIDE Site Location [C] <br>
Dark Force Icons: 1 Light Force Icons: 1 <br>
DS Text: During battles here, a character&#146;s power is equal to that character’s politics. <br>
LS Text: During battles here, a character&#146;s power is equal to that character’s politics. <br>
Planet Location <br>
Interior Site <br>
Episode I<br>
<br>
The Senate. The Corruption actually happens in the Senator&#146;s offices, but thats another story. Be aware, this is not a battleground according to the FKA CRD KNA STG. Politics = Power, so pack alot of Politcal People (Obviously). If there not playing Politics, then have fun with your drain of 1.<br>
<br>
Section 2: The Interrupts<br>
<br>
*Little Real Power <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
DARK SIDE Lost Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: &quot;He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.&quot; <br>
Text: During any control phase, target an opponent&#146;s character with politics present with your senator at Galactic Senate. For remainder of turn, target&#146;s game text is canceled and target is politics = 0. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Possiably the worst of the 6 senate interupts. You can use it for a quick beatdown if you&#146;d like. The most efficent use of this would be to take out Palpy or another High Politics character and then use force to lower Valorium&#146;s Politics for a huge beatdown on your turn.<br>
<br>
*No Civility, Only Politics <br>
Destiny 4 <br>
DARK SIDE Used Or Lost Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: It&#146;s not rare to see a senator using the system to forward his own personal agenda. Much goes on behind closed doors that the Senate never sees. <br>
Text: USED: During your move phase, take one of your characters with politics at Galactic Senate into hand. LOST: If you have a Republic character with politics in battle at a site, add one battle destiny; that character is power and politics = 0 until end of turn. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
An intresting interrupt, not one I particularly like, but none the less has its uses. You can take one character back to hand with politics during your move phase. This could come in handy if your battle just went horriably wrong and you need to avoid a beatdown, or you can use this to take a senator whose text isn&#146;t working as efficently and place him on a political effect. The lost portion of this card also allows you to take away a characters politics and add a battle destiny, which can be extremely usefull with a high destiny and low politics character, so track well. However it is lost so it may not be as usefull.<br>
<br>
*On The Payroll Of The Trade Federation <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
DARK SIDE Used Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: A political agenda is no use without supporters. And in the world of politics, left and right often meet in the middle. <br>
Text: Target an opponent&#146;s character at Galactic Senate if you have a senator there with a matching agenda. For remainder of turn: your senator&#146;s politics is increased by target&#146;s current politics, and target&#146;s politics is then reduced to zero. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
A good card expecially against badies like Palpy who try to get away with Taxation. With this card you can target someone like Passel and add 4 to his politics and subtract 4 from Palpys. Also you can use it on some of the smaller political guys, which can be usefull in a close battle.<br>
<br>
*Squabbling Delegates <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
DARK SIDE Used Interrupt [R] <br>
Lore: To simply be a sitting member of the Galactic Senate consumes a lot of time and energy. The opposition that is arrayed against you does not make it any easier. <br>
Text: Once per game, retrieve 1 Force for each of your senators at Galactic Senate. (Immune to Sense.) OR Take one senator (or Coruscant Guard) into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This is the Abyssian Ornament AND Jabba&#146;s Twerps for Senators. Absolutly essential in all senate decks. This card works wonders with conjunction with Lott Dod who can tunnel vision each turn for this card. Be careful as the retrieval part isn&#146;t immune to sense, however on the bright side its more efficent than the LS Version because you have more senators.<br>
<br>
*The Point Is Conceded <br>
Destiny 6 <br>
DARK SIDE Used Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: Political pressure carefully applied with a generous helping of Republic procedure can negate the strongest of motions. <br>
Text: If you have a senate majority, activate 1 Force. OR If your opponent has a senate majority, place your senator at Galactic Senate in Used Pile to place an opponent&#146;s character present (your choice) in opponent&#146;s Used Pile. (Immune to Sense.) <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The point is Conceded is a good destiny 6 interrupt you can track around with the senators. It allows you to activate one force when you have a majority, which you should most of the time. And it&#146;s only fair since LS Politics can start a 3-0 site. This cards alternate use can also help you when your in a rut by taking out Palpy, Val or even Queeny. Perhaps a senator is really hurting you? Take them out while your not in a majority with a scrub.<br>
<br>
*Vote Now! <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
DARK SIDE Used Interrupt [R] <br>
Lore: With enough political support, any number of devious plans can be put into motion. <br>
Text: During your control phase, draw destiny. If destiny &gt; 2, draw up to X cards (maximum 4) from Reserve Deck, where X = your total politics at Galactic Senate minus opponent’s total politics at Galactic Senate. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Vote Now! is an intresting card. It allows you to draw destiny to draw cards. I haven&#146;t seen this really played that much, probably because your trying to keep under the monnock limit and not draw up good destinies. Its alright. Vote Now! isn&#146;t a huge favorite of mine, but there are quite a few players who do play it. It&#146;s up to you, I&#146;d prefer to have another Lott Dod or a Maul in my deck than this.<br>
<br>
Section 3: Political Effects<br>
<br>
*Accepting Trade Federation Control <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: Palpatine suggested to the Queen that she acquiesce to the Trade Federation, just for the time being. <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to subtract 3 from any battle destiny just drawn. If a taxation agenda here, during your draw phase, you may activate 1 Force; opponent must use 1 Force (if possible). <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
I honestly have no clue what acquiesce means, but anyways, I believe only 1 deck i&#146;ve seen uses this, and although it does have its uses. With Yeb Yeb this card can be used to make your characters immune to attrition by knowing if the destiny is 3 or lower  During your draw phase you can activate 1 card and your opponent has to use 1. But again, during your draw phase the damage is done. Its not like you can save it up with Beggar/I Did It/Frozen Assets so predominant. I suggest ousting this one.<br>
<br>
*Motion Supported <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: &quot;The delegates from Malastare concur the with delegates from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed!&quot; <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to add 2 to your next Force drain at a battleground this turn. If a wealth agenda here, once per turn, you may lose your just drawn battle destiny to substitute it with a card from hand. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Possiably the most powerfull of the DS Politcal Effects. By placing a senator here each turn you can add 2 to a force drain at a battleground, which can be devistating with Maul/Vader/Mara and sticks. If you play Ties, that too could be a huge power source. Alternatively if you&#146;ve got an Extra 7 in your hand you can keep a wealth agent there to use it as a destiny (although your lose the original). With Lott Dod pulling ability, this card should be used every turn.<br>
<br>
*Our Blockade Is Perfectly Legal <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: Until it could be proven otherwise, the Trade Federation maintained that they were pursuing a legal means of protesting the taxation of outlying trade routes. <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to add 3 to any battle destiny just drawn . If a blockade agenda here, once during your turn you may cancel a &quot;react&quot; or an attempt by opponent to move away from a battle. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Perhaps a bit more usefull than our first Political effect in the fact that you can add 3 to your own battle destiny. This can be usefull in taking out Jedi Luke or other Immunity Mains. It also gives you the ability to cancel reacts and move away attempts. This isn&#146;t as usefull as it would have been a few months ago, but none the less, there are still quite a few react and run away cards so use this if they are popular in your area. Although if card space is thin, don&#146;t play this at all.<br>
<br>
*This Is Outrageous! <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: &quot;I recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth!&quot; <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to cancel an opponent&#146;s Force drain. If a trade agenda here, once during your turn, you may place a card from hand in Lost Pile, shuffle that pile, and take top card into hand. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This sounds like me when I went to Dunkin Donuts this morning and found out they changed the prices of Muffins to 1.25 EACH. That&#146;s out of control. The card itself is not outragous in the least. This is the Den of Thieves for Senators, which is pretty tech. By using Lott Dod you can block at least a drain each turn, and possiably block a drain + add to destinies etc. Luckly this effect happens opposite the +2 to drains one so its more effective. It&#146;s secondary text alows you to take a stab at luck by losing a card from hand (perhaps a unused podracer or useless card late game) and take a card into hand. it may be usefull, but i&#146;d like to block drains each turn.<br>
<br>
Section 4: Non-Senator Characters<br>
<br>
Coruscant Guard <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Coruscant Guards are an elite force whose assignments include the protection of important political figures, as well as the policing of Coruscant&#146;s higher profile city districts. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 1 <br>
Text: Once per turn, may use 1 Force to add 2 to politics of one of your senators present for remainder of turn. While present at Galactic Senate, all characters without politics here are forfeit = 0 (except Coruscant Guards). <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Warrior <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The Courscant Guard is like the secret service, you walk into the senate without being a politican and they&#146;ll shoot ya. They don&#146;t have any politics mind you, so they are power 0 in Senate battles, however they can use 1 force to add 2 (there power) to another character&#146;s politics which is a pretty even tradeoff. Also, they have the nice ability to make anyone whose not a Politican forfiet = 0, keeping random scrubs out. Deploy 2 Forfiet 4 is average, and ability 1 is alright because they don&#146;t need to be smart.<br>
<br>
*Keder The Black <br>
Destiny 1 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: A highly paid assassin and spy, Keder has infiltrated the Senate disguised as a Coruscant Guard. The identity of his target and his employer remains a mystery to all but him. <br>
POWER: 4 ABILITY: 3 Force-attuned: <br>
Text: Deploys only to a site as an Undercover spy (-2 on Coruscant). During your control phase, may &quot;break cover&quot; to target one character with politics present. Draw destiny. If destiny +1 &gt; target&#146;s politics, target and Keder are lost. <br>
DEPLOY: 4 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Warrior <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Ouch. Aren&#146;t we all lucky that Big D made these guys rare, he&#146;d rip up the senate with no Ep1 protection against him. Kender is an assasin, and the Royal Guards ain&#146;t gonna stop him (he looks like one of them ;) His deploy 4 is hefty but whose gonna deploy him elsewhere? He&#146;ll take off Palpy or Val&#146;s head faster than you can blink, and with Brangus Glee, he&#146;d be an absolute nightmare...<br>
<br>
Section 5: Senators<br>
<br>
*Aks Moe <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: Gran senator from Malastare. A skillful politician who demanded that a commission be sent to Naboo to investigate the alleged occupation there. <br>
POWER: 3 ABILITY: 3 Politics 3: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, blockade. While in a senate majority, your capital starships are each power +2, and your Force drains are +1 at each battleground system where you occupy a related site. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Ask Moe&#146;s is a very powerful politican. Not only does he have ability 3 and politics 3 he deploys for 2 and forfiets for 5 (7 with ). Adding Power +2 to your capital ships makes most of your Star Destroyers 10s and 11s, which makes them even more bang for the buck. Another quality this guy has is his addition to drains. While you control a site at the related system your drain is +1. Now remember that political effect that adds +2 to your drains, and with the 2 new Fallen portal hurters, why not play a db and a system? I dunno, you tell me.<br>
<br>
*Baskol Yeesrim <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Gran senator who is part of the Malastare delegation. Supported Aks Moe&#146;s suggestion for a commission to be sent to Naboo. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 3 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agenda: blockade. While in a senate majority, once during your control phase opponent loses 1 Force for each Naboo location you control. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Yea alright, he&#146;s a Naboo Ocupation, so if your playing Naboo sites (which you probably aren&#146;t), put him in. Also he&#146;s got the ever needed Blockade Agenda (or so I&#146;m told), so if you need a Blockade guy, play him I guess.<br>
<br>
*Edcel Bar Gane <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Senator from the planet Roona. One of the first to support Amidala&#146;s motion for a vote of no confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum. Intolerant of other species. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agenda: ambition. While in a senate majority, opponent may not draw more than one battle destiny in battles at battleground sites and you may not cancel opponent’s battle destiny draws at sites. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
I think most people play him because he&#146;s got BAR in his name, but irregardless, he&#146;s good. His power sucks, but he&#146;s a senator. He&#146;s got ability 2 + Politcs 2. Let me spell this guy out, he limits destiny draws to one at sites. No Beatdowns, No Destiny Adders, HE IS GOOD. Play him ok? His only downside is that he only has ambition, but he should be on the table anyways.<br>
<br>
*Lott Dod <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: Primary Neimoidian senator who represents the Trade Federation in the Galactic Senate. Thwarted attempts by Amidala to end the blockade of Naboo. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 3 Politics 4: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, blockade, trade. While in a senate majority, once during your control phase, may search your Force Pile and take any one card there into hand; reshuffle. While at Galactic Senate, your other Neimoidians are forfeit +2. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Hmm, Politcs 4, Ability 3, Deploy For 2. He needs no introduction, he&#146;s Lott Dod, he&#146;s the almighty god of the DS Senate. He&#146;s a Tunnel Vision and Tight Character all rolled into one. Play at least 2 of him, he&#146;s going to be the heart of the senate. He makes other Neimoidians forfiet +2, yea ok, but he tunnel visions too. Grab a Senator, grab anything you need, its all good. PLAY LOTT DOD.<br>
<br>
*Orn Free Taa <br>
Destiny 4 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Obese Rutian Twi&#146;lek senator. Once a tax collector, he has used his connections and political power to fuel a myriad of devious plots for whomever can make him the highest offer. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 3 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: taxation, wealth. While in a senate majority, once per turn may take your just drawn battle destiny into hand. During opponent&#146;s deploy phase, you may use X Force to place Taa in your Used Pile. (X = cards in opponentís Force Pile.) <br>
DEPLOY: 1 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
I didn&#146;t know he Twi&#146;leks came in multiple colors. He deploys for 1, and he&#146;s one of the weaker senators. Taxation and Wealth are his game and ability 3 for 1 deploy is pretty nice. You can use his game text to avoid a beatdown if he&#146;s the lone character in the senate and your opponent starts deploying. And you can take a just drawn battle destiny into hand which can be very usefull when drawing cards you need. Plus he&#146;s destiny 4 whats bad about that?<br>
<br>
*Passel Argente <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: A senator known for his ability to deflect blame. It is rumored that Argente receives kickbacks from a few corporations to thwart other companies’ developments. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, taxation. While in a senate majority, opponent&#146;s non-unique starships and non-unique vehicles are each deploy +2 and power -1. Argente is politics +X, where X = number of opponent&#146;s senators at same site. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 3 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Passel is an increadably strong character. First off he deploys for 3, which may seem a bit expensive for a politic + ability 2 character but he&#146;s well worth it. Say goodbye to EBOX/HBX, cause Deploy +2 and Power -1 is bad, for them. His politics can be raised emmensly when in a large senate group, since each character the opponent deploys he gets +1 which is very nice, as he can be come more powerfull than everyone else.<br>
<br>
*Tikkes <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Quarren senator elected by the people of Mon Calamari. Has amassed considerable wealth through a multitude of political deals, but still moves to gain more. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 3 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agenda: wealth. While in a senate majority, your Force generation is +2 at battlegrounds you control, and Honor Of The Jedi is suspended. Once during your deploy phase, may draw bottom card of your Force Pile into hand. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 6 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
We&#146;re almost done with card reviews, and I&#146;ll even give you a five minute break... if you behave. Tikkes is another great DS Senator (noticing a pattern with these DS Senators?). He cancels HOTJ which means you don&#146;t need No Escape, but I think No Escape is a good card to play anyways, so use both. Force generation is absolutly Huge. Be sure to remember that taking over the Cantina vs WYS will not give you any extra force, aka you&#146;ll be dead in the water. Drawing cards during your deploy phase is absolute tech and sweet with some mains.<br>
<br>
*Toonbuck Toora <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Female senator and member of her planet&#146;s ruling class. Her original optimism in the political process has been eroded by witnessing bribery, corruption and petty bickering. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 3 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, taxation, wealth. While in a senate majority, once per turn may add 1 to your total attrition in battle for each character with an ambition agenda at Galactic Senate. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 3 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Toonbuck Toora, in my opinion is one of the weaker senators. He&#146;s high points include the fact he has 3 agendas, and his game text allows you to add 1 to total attrition with is nice, if the characters aren&#146;t immune and stuff like that. However, that is his only text unlike other senators who have two, three or even four abilities while in a senate majority. She&#146;s also a destiny 3 so you probably should play her anyways, but I&#146;d not pack 2 of her.<br>
<br>
*Yeb Yeb Adem’thorn <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
DARK SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Senator who opposes the taxation of trade routes. Some say that a recent move from his homeworld to a luxurious Coruscant abode is evidence of his corruption. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: trade, wealth. While in a senate majority, once during your turn, may peek at top card of opponent’s Reserve Deck; return that card or lose 1 Force to make it lost. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Yeb Yeb Yeb is a machine in conjuntion with a few other cards. Maul&#146;s Binoculars, The Political Effects, and Gardulla The Hutt all come up in my mind. It also gives you vital information if you plan a beatdown on what their destiny may be. Use this card, and heck you may even want two of em cause there just that tech.<br>

III) Deck Ideas, Etc.<br>
<br>
This section will cover everything else. First I&#146;ll compare/contrast a few of the most popular decks, Then I&#146;ll discuss Senate + Ep1 Enviorment, Third, I&#146;ll give you a few cards to add, and Finally, the &quot;Must Have&quot; Cheat Sheet. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
Section 1: Current Top DS Senate Decks<br>
<br>
The following decks are all avaliable (currently) on the top 10 decks of decktech, please feel free to check them out but be sure to come back!! I&#146;ll include the list of links at the end of this section for future reference.<br>
<br>
The three decks I am going to look at each play differently. The authors include Mike &quot;Gemme&quot; Gemme, Jim &quot;Stimmed Jim&quot; Li and Tony &quot;PrimetimeT&quot; Depa<br>
<br>
Let me first give you the names of the 3 decks then we&#146;ll discuss them a bit. First is &quot;Lotti Doddi, We like to party - Senate Thunder&quot; (Gemme). Second we have &quot;Stimmed Jim’s Senators&quot;. Finally, &quot;Maul and Lott Dod’s Senate Party&quot;<br>
<br>
Gemme&#146;s &quot;Senate Thunder&quot; - Gemme&#146;s deck like most DS Senate decks starts the Desert Landing site enabling Maul to deploy for free. He also starts combo IAO, Crush and Combo SAC killer. Gemme chose to play one battleground db (Tatooine DB 94), 2 non-battleground (Courscant + Executor) plus the new Bridge and Hoth War Room. He uses the ever infamous, Responsabilty Of Command/Much Anger In Him (ROC/MAIH or Shaft) Combo. Gemme is also using what I call the &quot;Everyone and their brother&quot; Senate idea, which is Limited Resources with helper cards, which seemed to be everyones idea when they first saw the objective. However, Gemme excutes this deck masterfully. He plays 4x Defensive Fires and 3x Limited Resources along with a strong 9 member Senate (with 2x Lott Dod). He also plays a Scanning Crew and It&#146;s Worse, Ability x3 and Security Precautions which really make you feel like driving your fist through the table. He&#146;s got the amount of senators to hold the senate and manages to pull of Maul and Vader with some helpers excellently. I would (and did) give this deck 5 stars because its absolutly a great piece of work. This is an excellent starting point for any player whose looking for a deck for the next days tournament!<br>
<br>
Stimmed Jim&#146;s Senators - Stimmed Jim claims this deck sucks, If it was updated with some better cards, it would definatly be an all star, seing as the deck was created the weekend after Courscant came out. Stimmed Jim decided also to start the Landing site, YCHFE regular, Sac Killer Combo, and Begin Landing Your Troops (to add to the forfiet). Stimmed Jim instead of Docking bays chose to play the JP sites. He plays a HUGE collection of characters but not many effects interrupts. I would suggest adding another Squab Delegates. He chose to play 2x of Ender, Tikkes and Lott, and a few other senators, totalling 9. I like how he sets up a good solid mains base, however I also think he should be playing another Galid as he is essential to quick drop and drains at the palace. His site choices are good as are his ships. Good job overall and definatly a deck too look at if you don&#146;t want to play the more direct damage/limited resources type deck that Gemme decided to play. Be sure to make some changes, as this deck need quite a few (read the reviews for good ideas!!!).<br>
<br>
PrimetimeT&#146;s &quot;Senate Party&quot; - Primetime chose similarly to play the JP type Senate deck, and this one seems almost to be a more solid mains deck than Stimmed Jim&#146;s. He too (as the other 2 have) starts the Desert Landing Site. However his starting interupt choice includes IAO combo and the SAC Killer combo, but his third effect is a surprising one, The Phantom Menace. He plays 4 copies of Maul, 2 Vaders, 2 Jades, 2 Galids, plus other vital main characters. He&#146;s also playing a stable 9 senate base (with doubles of Lott Dod, and no other doubles). Origianlly he was playing the Nemoidain group but took them out in an update. He also plays 2x Limited Resources which is usefull when a player expects to be playing vs a solid mains and not vs limited resources. He has a short Effect list, including 2 senate effects and only Fanfare. He also gets great drains in with 3 Sabers and Galid. This deck would be an absolute monster with the new EPP Maul and Phantom Menace. Finally, he plays Sebulba&#146;s Racer which could be usefull against a heavy racing meta. With just a couple of meta changes this deck too can be a monster.<br>

<br>
Section 2: Ep1 Enviorment (Type II)<br>
<br>
I&#146;m not a huge fan of the Ep1 Enviorment, however Senate is a major factor in these tournaments. Seeing as you&#146;ll only be seening probably LS Senate and Hyperdrive (both with Senate + Podracing more than likely) you&#146;ll have to be on your toes and ready to go head to head in the Senate. The interrupts your looking for here are more than likely &quot;Real Little Power&quot;, but only one because it is lost and only usefull when your ready to beat down, and &quot;The Point Is Concedded&quot;. In conjunction with Lott Dod and The new abyssian ornament for senators, this can help you create an &quot;inpenetrable fortress&quot; at the senate. This will also allow you to use all the usefull game texts in a senate majority which can be a life or death deal in ep1 closed enviorment. Obviously you should start the desert landing site as it is the best site as long as you have Maul. Look to take out the Jedis with Maul, The Phantom Menace, and Maul Strikes. Getting a drain of 4+ is absolute a game-ender against a LS Senate or Jedi Deck. Be careful of other cards that can hurt Maul Though. If you win the EPP Maul, God bless you, you&#146;ll win more i&#146;m sure. EPP Maul can wipe out the entire JCC with Phantom Menace, which proves to be superb with your senators. I&#146;d suggest playing a HIGH number of senators at least 13 or 14, prefferably 15 or 16. you&#146;ll also want to look into Mauls and Destroyer Droids, as they too can be superb in games. My suggest for those of you who are intrested is to look at Neal &quot;Dredlox&quot; Razi&#146;s Dredlox’s Type II HardCore Senators, which is a force to be reckoned with in Ep1 Enviorment. I&#146;ve provided the link below:<br>
<br>
Dredlox’s Type II HardCore Senators: http://www.decktech.net/swccg/decks/light/lightdetail.php3?deck=18697<br>
<br>
Section 3: LS VS DS Senate<br>
<br>
By all means, DS Appears to be the stronger of the 2 decktypes. However when matched up, LS Senate can pull a few tricks out of it&#146;s sleeves so to speak. First off DS Senate is undebatably more powerfull both in deploy, forifet, abiltiy and poitics. They just have more brute force. Their game texts are far more usefull than the LS counterparts (except perhaps the &quot;System/Site Combo&quot; which can cause mass retrieval/force loss if set up correctly), and finally they just plainly HAVE MORE SENATORS. DS has NINE SENATORS. LS has FIVE SENATORS (plus 4 other non-senator politicans (Val, Queen, Mas, Sei)). Overall, in a mains vs mains senate decks, DS will win probably 9 outa 10, however if a player can create the right combo of cards for LS politics, be wary, be afraid. I&#146;ll probably be flamed for the idea of usefull LS politics, but remember, you heard it here first.<br>
<br>
Section 4: The Cards To Play<br>
<br>
Other Than Senate Cards given in the above sections (card reviews), I&#146;ve got some other &quot;Tech Cards&quot; to play with your DS Senate Deck...<br>
<br>
Starting:<br>
<br>
-Desert Landing Site- It&#146;s 2/0, Maul Deploys Free... Do I need any other explanations? I think not. If you don&#146;t have it your really out of luck and should find one (I mean there Tat Rares, not that hard to find)<br>
-IAO/Secret Plans- Pulling DBs is popular, probably because the 1 less added to forfiet is not that big. Secret Plans start is just a machine as it helps you immensely against most LS decks (Mains, WYS)<br>
-TINT/OE- Let&#146;s face it, Jedis are out. There ability 7, and SAC is back. Just start this baby and don&#146;t sweat it, that&#146;s my opinion. You could always play SAC yourself, but i don&#146;t suggest playing with fire against fire.<br>
-Begin Landing Your Troops- Similar to IAO, but adds +2 forfiet to your Republic Characters (READ: SENATORS). Stimmed Jim had this idea, and it&#146;s a good one in my book. It&#146;s up to you to choose between IAO and this one.<br>
-Do They Have Code Clearance- Another retrieval killer that can be played instead of Secret Plans, usefull as it acts as a grabber and lessens retrieval. Starting with this and Secret Plans could be a menace to retrieval maniacs.<br>
<br>
Characters:<br>
<br>
-Lott Dod x2- Yes I did mention him above, but again, play 2x him. Get 2x him. He is GOD OF DS POLITICS and you MUST PLAY 2X HIM. Ok? Only 1 will be taken out quickly and efficently with no justice. And that would be bad.<br>
-EPP Maul- Out on a limb, he&#146;s good, you gotta win him for now, but if you get him with Phantom Menace, he&#146;ll rip up the floor. Enough on him now.<br>
-Maul- Either works. If Jedi are popular in your area play Courscant, if not play Tatooine. Each has their own advantages, and Tat seems to be more popular. Again Phatom Menace and Maul Strikes can be beasts with this guy, and since you ARE starting your landing site...<br>
-Droids- Either the New Destroyer Droids or Sith Droids could be usefull, try them out and see what you think.<br>
-U3P0/Arica- Cancelling more drains = better for you in the long run. The less you lose the more you&#146;ll drain and retrieve and block etc. Good stuff, play them but be carefull or Mr. Horn.<br>
-Galid- Prefered Character of JP Sites =)<br>
<br>
Interrupts:<br>
<br>
-Nemodian Advisor- Pull your battlegrounds, it should be fairly obvious so I won&#146;t go into great depth.<br>
-Accelerate- New Twileck, why play the old? Maybe play 1 of each so they don&#146;t get grabbed.<br>
-Omni Box/It&#146;s Worse- Incase they try to It Could Be Worse, or just shuffle there deck if you don&#146;t like what Yeb Yeb sees for you.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Limited Resource&quot; Group:<br>
<br>
-Limited Resources- Make them lose 4 during there turn<br>
-Monnock/Drop- Make them drop hand size if they go over 13<br>
-Defensive Fire- put a card used<br>
-Defensive Fire/Combo - Get rid of undercover spies too ;)<br>
-Scanning Crew- Place a rebel in used<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
<br>
-Ability x3- Annoying as Hell, can we all agree?<br>
-SHAFT- (Responsability of Command/Much Anger In Him Combo) Good Stuff vs people like Theron Nett etc who just need to be damaged badly. Helps alot when trying to reduce hand size.<br>
-Grabbers (Either)- There all good, play at least 1. You need to grab stuff, grabbing stuff WILL help you win games. Ok?<br>
-Phantom Menace- Maul should stay alive, why not help him with a 7 you can use too.<br>
-Secret Plans- If you don&#146;t start it, PLAY IT.<br>
-No Escape- Great help, and use to retrieve important cards!!<br>
<br>
Ships:<br>
<br>
-Bounty Hunters- Basically, these are the ships I&#146;d recommend, Bossk, Zuckuss, Dengar are all good choices. Play all 3 if you&#146;d like. Boba I&#146;d rather have on ground, but you can play him space too.<br>
-Chimera- A monster with Grand Admiral Thrawn, Good power/ability SD too.<br>
-Stinger- Guri is good in this if you want to play both. Limiting Destinies is &quot;Tech&quot;<br>
<br>
Weapons:<br>
<br>
-Sabers- The only weapons I recommend. Add to force drain is good, Maul&#146;s stick helps you alot with Maul. Hopefully we&#146;ll see a 2 sided one soon.<br>
<br>
Sites:<br>
<br>
-Echo War Room- If your going to Shaft, you need this site!!<br>
-Docking Bays- Like Gemmes deck, play like Courscant + Executor and then Tat. It&#146;s all good. <br>
-JP Sites- Your other option, use Galid and such to get drop + drains going really welL!<br>
<br>
Other:<br>
<br>
-Sebulba&#146;s Pod- might As well give yourself a chance if your racing correct?<br>
-Podracer Collision- May want to play one both for Podrace help + verify bashing<br>
<br>
Section 4: Main Deck Types<br>
<br>
-Limited Resources-<br>
<br>
Play Limited Resources, Defensive Fires, Scanning Crews, Ability X3, Monnock, everything and anything that will annoy your opponent to hell. ROC/MAIH/Shaft is all good too. Direct Force Loss is key in this deck. Play a few mains but more care reducers.<br>
<br>
-JP-<br>
<br>
Play the Palace Exterior Site, Audience Chamber, Lower Passages, and Galid x2. This deck is more of a mains deck than Limited Resources. You&#146;ll want 2-4 Mauls, 2-4 Vaders, Maras, Emperor, etc. Is also like a HD deck with some added Senate (instead of Podracing)<br>
<br>
-Podracing-<br>
<br>
Not a good idea for a deck IMO, maybe in type 2. Generally you&#146;ll only want to focus on one &quot;lame&quot; deck idea at time... (no offense)<br>
<br>
-Type II- <br>
<br>
Play the Senate Obj and use as Many Mauls + other good characters as you have. Play 2x each sentator + interrupt, HOLD THE SENATE AT ALL COSTS!!!<br>
<br>
Section 5: Building Your Deck<br>
<br>
Obviously, your going to want to start out by reading the senate objective and senate location. These are your first two cards. I&#146;m going to suggest you refer frequently back to my suggested cards list above, as these are the basis of your deck other than politics. Generally I&#146;d suggest cutting Bas as he is only usefull with Naboo which you probably won&#146;t be playing as a Senator. Try playing 2x Lott and maybe 2x Tikkies. This is all really up to you. I suggest playing about 2x of Squabbling Delegates, and 2 of the Senate(Political) Effects of your choice. Remember you need to flip to get these characters off! Your starting site should also be the Landing Site unless you have another idea. Choose 3 (probably on the list) of starting effects. The rest of the cards really depend on the deck type (as listed above). Your 2 main choices seem to be JP or Limited Resources. Look at your cards to see what you can play with your current collection and choose accordingly. Also check the decks to your local meta and be sure to add and take out cards you don&#146;t like or don&#146;t feel are necessary. Be sure to play the deck through several times before playing it at a tournament. I suggest creating one solid LS deck, playing it by itself a few times, then building this deck and play them vs each other. If you have a friend/partner/sibling who plays good, if not try to play fairly on both sides. As a last word of advice Grabbers are essential, be sure to use them!!!<br>
<br>
Section 6: THE CHEAT SHEET<br>
<br>
Name, Destiny, Power, Ability, Politics, Agendas, Deploy, Forfiet<br>
<br>
AKS - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 - A, B - 2 - 5<br>
BAS - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - B - 3 - 5<br>
EBG - 3 - 1 - 2 - 2 - A - 3 - 5<br>
GOD - 2 - 1 - 3 - 4 - A, B, T - 2 - 5<br>
OFT - 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 - T, W - 1 - 4<br>
PAS - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - A, T - 3 - 3<br>
TIK - 2 - 2 - 3 - 2 - W - 3 - 6<br>
TOO - 2 - 2 - 3 - 2 - A, T, W - 2 - 3<br>
YEB - 3 - 1 - 2 - 2 - T, W - 2 - 4<br>
<br>
Section 7: The Future...<br>
<br>
What will the future hold for both sides of the senate? No one really knows, once the r3 cards start getting pumped out we&#146;ll have a better understanding if Senate will be the new &quot;Pre-Eratta Operatives&quot; or if it&#146;ll be the &quot;Post-Eratta Operatives&quot;, or maybe it&#146;ll just be one of those decks you can go and build and have a good time. Hopefully, I&#146;ll get another article up sometime before R3, and probably have suppliments to these articles (aka UPDATE VERSIONS) when R3 comes out, if and only if, senate is still a viable decktype. I mean, I don&#146;t feel like writing a article on DBO, so if it&#146;s as usefull as DBO, you won&#146;t see it. As for myself, I&#146;ll be around as long as this game doesn&#146;t get any more &quot;lame ideas&quot; as many players have noticed...<br>
<br>
IV) Ending<br>
<br>
Thank you again for joining me, I hope this article lived up to all your expectations, it took phenominally longer than the LS article did. The DS Senate is so much more in-depth than LS, and I hope you&#146;ve seen that I have looked over your LS reviews with care and tried my best to try and keep everyone happy by expanding the actual writing parts, while keeping the same quality of writing for card reviews, for those unfamiliar with the cards. Please, feel free to DMail me any messages or comments about this at &quot;Wow&quot;. <br>
<br>
Thank You<br>
