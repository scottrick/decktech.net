'For an evolutionary system, continuing development is needed just in order to maintain its fitness relative to the systems it is co-evolving with.'<br>
<br>
This idea is really just putting into words what we already know, but that in no way diminishes the truth of those words.  Decks in the SWCCG game are obviously in competition with each other, and from that competition only the best decks emerge.	What's more, these decks need to keep developing as their opposition develops, or they will eventually be destroyed.  That's intuitive.  What I plan to illustrate is how this arms race process occurs, and how you can apply this principle to your deck construction and playstyles.<br>
<br>
The best way to understand the process is to observe it in action, so let's start with some specifics.  The Space race: light versus dark.  Before the release of Special Edition there was one dreaded Light Starfighter: Super-Falcon.  Han Solo on board the Falcon with another good pilot like Lando, Wedge, or BoShek was a force to be reconned with.  Unfortunately, that was about all they had going at the time.  Red Leader in Red 1, Gold Leader in Gold 1, and Tantive IV pretty much summed up the best of the Rebel fleet.  But for the most part, the Dark Side had the clear advantage with it's assortment of powerful Star Destroyers and effective pilots, not to mention the mighty Executor.  What Special Edition did was gave the Rebels a chance to stand their ground by giving the poor fleets of the Rebellion the will and the means to dominate in space, taking on several forms.  Hidden Base, of course, was and is the lynchpin of Light Side space decks.  There is virtually no reason for a deck dedicated to space not to play it, because of all the benefits it allows: deploying systems (increasing Force Activation, removing Destiny 0 cards, and giving out high drain locations), canceling force drains (allowing you to focus your energies in the battlefield of space with little trade off), and your opponent must pay to draw cards (denying resources to your opponent).  By attacking the Dark Side in several areas at once, Hidden Base was already a step up for Light Side space deck.  But then, Special Edition also gave us new ways to enhance the ships that made up the fleet.  B-Wings had the most power of a non-unique fighter so far.	Organized Attack did for X- and Y-Wings what Trooper Assault had done for, well, troopers.  S-Foils gave you extra power at a price (no more running away, now you've gotta stand your ground against those Star Destroyers).	Docking and Repair Facilities was the Bacta Tank of space (minus the bullet cards).  Rebel Fleet gave yet another way to cancel drains.  And All Wings Report In, a Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes for ships, gave it speed and retrieval.  In short, the playing field had changed dramatically.  Hidden Base decks weren't the space decks of old, they were, well, a new animal.  Not that the Dark Side was driven from the skies; they too had received a boost.  But now Light Side Hidden Base needed to be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
So we come to our first conflict: traditional Dark Side space vs. Hidden Base.	Hidden Base had learned the intoxicating effects of sheer power over nimbleness that the Dark Side had enjoyed, and now the Empire was on the defensive.  If Dark Side space was to continue, it would need to change in order to accomidate the changing environment; the Red Queen Principle in action.  Were it to not change, it would be consistently beaten to the point where no one wanted to play it and it would be dead as a deck concept.  So, change or die.  In this case, the opposition was analyzed to look for weaknesses.  While Yarna dal Gargan and S-Foils, common cards in 'swarm' decks weren't always vulnerable to Alter, it seemed an unlikely solution.	The basic weaknesses were the Organized Attack (it could be 'grabbed' and therefore removed from play; and since Dark Side space could use the SAC protection and destiny boosting of Oppressive Enforcement anyway, There'll Be Hell To Pay becomes a perfect addition to stopping Organized Attack/Out of Nowhere madness), vulnerability to probing (destroying two of the three advantages of their objectives) and the fact that the ships needed to be grouped in order to draw destiny.  In addition to There'll Be Hell To Pay, more powerful ships were in order: Bossk in Hound's Tooth, Death Squadron Star Destroyer, and Vader's Personal Shuttle.  The environment had shifted again (also thanks to the errata on Hidden Base), and now dedicated Dark Space vs. Hidden Base became a less one-sided contest.<br>
<br>
Enter Enhanced Premier and Endor.  Enhanced Premier offered little to space, except for the addition of Leia with Blaster Rifle to the aforementioned Super-Falcon (7 +3 destiny draws, or 9 +destiny for those who played Special Modifications).  Endor, on the other hand, offered several cards that were going to cause changes in the environment.  Security Precautions is the best known anti-Hidden Base card released, as it directly attacks players who use the objective, yet still can be useful against other decks.  A force loss of 8-10 can be brutal, so the Light Side needed to find a way to deal with the new threat of Security Precautions.  The Light Side had to find a way to approach this new threat.  It couldn't get rid of the card, so it had to limit the damage or prevent probing.  Since the latter wasn't possible either, the former was looked at.  Obviously deploying more planets would help, but that meant giving up extra deck space, waiting longer to flip (no deploying systems once you're flipped), and giving the Dark Side more force and more opportunities to drain you; this didn't seem like a good option.  It Could Be Worse became more popular as a way to deal with the force loss, and it could be useful against other decks anyway.  Others just ignored it, deciding that the best way to deal with the problem is to change the venue (this became possible because of the aforementioned Enhanced Premiere).  With destiny adding, weapon toting mains dropping onto their planets and slicing up their characters, the Dark Side had its hands full.	Here's a case where some change can be powerful but not devestating: Light was able to cope with the addition of Security Precautions by simply being more efficient.	Incidentally, the arms race continued one step further, with Dark Side decks packing a copy or two of 'It's Worse' to make that probe a now critical blow if the Light Side tried to stop the force loss.<br>
<br>
Enter Enhanced Cloud City and Enhanced Jabba's Palace.  Hidden Base is now confronted with four new ships, each with a new ability to confront them: Boba Fett in Slave I (Immunity to attrition and a destiny draw), Dengar in Punishing One (Cancels Immunity and combats swarms), IG-88 in IG-2000 (adds a destiny), and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter (Can reduce opponent's battle destiny to 0, and can add a pilot).	Also, 4-LOM with Concussion Rifle, when on the Mist Hunter with Zuckuss, adds another destiny.	These Bounty Hunters ships were a direct attack on Hidden Base swarm: they brought in heavy power, multiple destinies, huge attrition against swarms, and were relatively cheap.  In addition, one of the new objectives allowed the deployment of these ships straight from the Reserve Deck.	The environment had changed: sheer power was no longer enough to win against these forces, and many said that Hidden Base Swarm was dead.  So, the deck had to adapt to this new change, or die.  Which brings us to now.<br>
<br>
Today: For Hidden Base Swarm to survive it had to find a way to combat the 'Bounty Hunter' ships.  Unfortunately, in deference to Tim Allen, more power wasn't the answer in this case.  Hidden Base Swarm needed to look at the other sides weaknesses to exploit in order to triumph.  These were unique starfighters (with the obvious exception of Hound's Tooth, which can move and deploy like one), so that would be a good place to start.	What can be done to hurt a unique starfighter?	Two differing approaches have emerged, each with their own advantages.<br>
Eject! Eject!: It can stop the ship by killing the pilot; with no one to fly the ship it can't participate in the battles and cause headaches.  Sounds good.  The disadvantage, of course, is they can put a pilot in and start right up again, and if the ship is lost, so's the objective.	Plus, there's no guaranteeing it'll work anyway: if you draw a 2 or less for destiny you've just wasted a card.  Also, the Dark Side will already have deployed and smacked your ships around; too little, too late.  For Eject! Eject! to work these problems would need to be addressed.  Destiny stacking will make sure the card succeeds (perhaps using Electrobinoculars or an ASP-707 droid).  As for stopping the smackdown ahead of time, Rebel Barrier and Alternatives to Fighting can both handle this (or Hyper Escape if you're not using S-Foils or have nearby sectors).<br>
X-Wing Laser Cannons: It can make a ship lost if used properly, giving you the advantage in a battle, and maybe even preventing the opponent from probing (this last point assumes stupidity on their part, but in the heat of the game, everyone can act stupid from time to time).  The disadvantage being that you need to save a lot of force to use it to the fullest and you need one at every system they might attack you at, which means an investment in cards.  Also, you HAVE to play X-Wings, there's no other way to do this.  These problems again need to be addressed.  We can turn the disadvantage of having to get so many by including Stay Sharp, which allows us to add the destiny number of our weapon (in this case, a 5) to our power, and also providing a Used 'Sniper' with our starship weapons.  This is now useful in most situations in space battles - the only time it wouldn't be would be against capital starships.	Fortunately, capital ships overall have become less popular, with the exception of Hound's Tooth, Dreadnaughts, and the Executor.  For those who disagree, run a check through the Decktech listings and you'll find that Zuckuss in Mist Hunter appears in almost four times as many decks as Death Squadron Star Destroyer, despite the fact that this ship is excellent.  To the Force question, we need to either generate more force, lower the cost of our cards, or play with cards that give us force.  Dagobah and Dagobah: Yoda's Hut are good examples of the first, providing an extra four force with only two card slots that can't be drained at (for the most part), and they can come straight from the Reserve Deck.  For lowering costs, Haven is popular in some decks, usually as a starting Effect on Rendezvous Point.  For the last one, Yoda's Stew is probably the best choice, as it also provides some Monnok protection to.  Lastly, we can take advantage of this change in the environment by looking at other cards that play off this strategy.  Slayn and Korpil Facility can add a little retrieval to your decks now.	How about Away Put Your Weapon?  Used, it kicks Mara or Vader's saber back in the deck to teach them not to play with it; Lost, it can send all those X-Wing Laser Cannons back to your lost pile; that is, if you think a 5 destiny interrupt that can increase your differential by 4-10 is worth it?<br>
Balanced Attack: Not played very much, but can be helpful.  While Zuckuss in Mist Hunter makes your battle destiny zero, you can still increase your attrition with this card.	X-Wing/B-Wings with S-Foils or X-Wing/Y-Wing with Organized Attack can both take advantage of this.  And, of course, the Falcon provides two instead of one.<br>
<br>
These are some of the ways that Hidden Base Swarm is trying to 'rebalance' (in other words, catch up to where they used to be; again, the Red Queen Principle) the environment.  Will it succeed or not remains to be seen.  If so, then it will be the Dark Side Players turn to adapt.  Just to continue the exercise, let's assume that either the Eject! Eject! or X-Wing Laser Cannons concept becomes dominant; how would we combat that?  Again, we look at the weaknesses of the deck and go from there.  Eject! Eject! may encourage the use of Outer Rim Scouts in Dark Side Space, since they add 3 to power, are non-unique, and leaves the ships almost exactly as they were before the pilot was lost (Mist Hunter still cancels attrition, etc.).  Oh, and remember that none of the normal deployment problems exist for the pilot, because it doesn't say on the card that it must be a bounty hunter or anything like that; you could have Vader piloting if you like.  Decks who don't like this option can always go with the cheese approach: wait until they set up their destiny and Ommni Box.  It may be worth it just for the annoyance factor.<br>
But what if X-Wing Laser Cannons become all the rage?  If that's the case, perhaps Overload will come out of the closet for good.  If you don't remember, Overload was flirted with for a while to kill Enhanced Premiere Mains, but the requirement to draw a zero is a little to restrictive for a Lost Interrupt.	But if you draw anything less than the weapon's destiny (in this case, 4 or less), the weapon's toast, and with it the problems that came with it.  First Strike would work with this ideally: Overload, deploy, start a battle, retrieve the Overload while laughing at the impending beatdown.<br>
And let's not forget that the environment may change again with Third Anthology, coming very soon (I hope), and definately will be different after Death Star II.  What will come will depend on how the new cards enhance both Hidden Base and Bounty Hunter Ship strategies, and we'll see which is fast enough to remain where they started.<br>
<br>
<br>
But that's not the end of this article; that's only one example (don't worry, the rest won't be quite that in depth).  Cycles tend to emerge as certain cards dominate out of necessity for survival.  This seems to go through a pattern as follows: new and very effective strategy, counter-strategy becomes popular, original strategy stops because it's no longer viable, counter-strategy dies out.  Frozen Assets is an excellent example of this.  For a time, Draw Their Fire/Frozen Assets beatdown was all the rage, because it was simple and effective.  Then people started playing two or three Main Courses which can specifically stop Frozen Assets.  So, Light Side stops using Frozen Assets.  Dark Side then realizes that, while it can still be useful, Main Course is really just a wasted card slot, and it trickles from three to two to one to zero.  Then, after some time, someone decides to use Frozen Assets again, whether in a new deck or a rehash of the old.  Of course, the Dark Side knows immediately what to do to stop the deck, but the question is, do you start or not start including Main Courses in there, just on the chance you run into the Frozen Assets deck?  That depends on the 'metagame', or the larger view that we've been focusing on, the gaming environment.  If people in your area are latching on to the Frozen Assets deck, you do put it in, because if you don't change you'll be continually defeated.  However, if it's just the occasional rogue deck, change wouldn't be in your best interest (this goes back to 'warping' as the Old Schooler pointed out; read his editorial if you haven't already).  It is only when the environment changes to the point that playing Main Courses is worth the trouble that you start including them.  Of course, then the Frozen Assets decks get crushed and people stop playing them, and once again, you're wondering whether or not you should stop including Main Course.  Another example of running as fast as you can to stay where you are.<br>
<br>
Numbers(decks using 3720 to 1/Never Tell Me the Odds), of course, is another example of this principle.  While this decktype dominated, everyone was working on finding ways to cope with that deck.  Today, less than half of all the decks on Decktech include ANY protection against Numbers.  Why?	It's no longer a dominant decktype because too many decks included anti-Numbers strategies (Don't Forget The Droids-Ultimatum/Torture-Resistance), and so traditional Numbers doesn't work.	However, those decks that do try to continue Numbers try to develop to cope with the environment.  They make this effort because, firstly, they see the overall vulnerability: if half my games are against players with no Numbers defense, it's unlikely I'll lose.  Also, they can try to find ways to deal with the opposing forces.  Grabbers can limit the number of inserts that can be countered, and Voyeur/Visored Vision can remove them from the lost pile.  Both have the same goal: destroy their counter-measures.  Ultimatum/Resistance is a little harder to deal with, but another way of dealing with change is adapting.	In this case, not playing the standard Numbers deck but a variation that can still deal damage, but can also use Inserts to speed up victory.  Hidden Base Numbers and Speeder Numbers are both attempts at this kind of deck that can have its cake and eat it too.<br>
<br>
One final example: Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi.  Dueling or non-Dueling, no one can deny the popularity of this deck.  Everyone knows the two main threats of this deck: Visage of the Emperor damage, and Dueling.	As a result, there are virtually no tournament decks that don't pack some kind of defense against Visage, and many will include something if they're playing Luke or Obi-wan to help deal with the duels.  And, of course, since Hunt Down players know the Light Side is making these efforts, they'll pack their own methods to counter their counter-strategy (Say it with me: Red Queen Principle).  The ways to counter Visage are two-fold: control the site, or Transmission Terminated.  Now, the Dark Side player can include Holonet Transmission which stops Transmission Terminated, and some do.  However, some, can't see a reason to include a 2 destiny card that is usable only against one other card; it comes down to individual choice, like the Eject/Cannons discussion from above.	Regardless, the Dark Side player needs to be ready for an opponent who deploys a spy to the site, or who revolves the site and drops a character.  Crush the Rebellion/Evader is certainly an option, as it can not only deal with the revolving Holotheater but also against Throne Room-style decks.	Regardless of choice, one thing almost all Hunt Down players agree upon is including a second Visage.  Many believe the card is too important to play without, and seeing as how the Light side will usually devote 2-4 cards just to dealing with its eventuality, it certainly shouldn't be a surprise.  As for dueling, many players will only duel at crucial times, and will use various types of back up to lean the odds in their favor: The Dark Path, Focused Attack, Grand Moff Tarkin (you just have to initiate the duel during the battle to counter one of their destinies), and making certain that you have a lightsaber first.  Others don't want to risk losing the big guy because they know their opponent will probably be ready for them, and a loss of Vader would be devestating; they don't duel.  Period.	However, some include Epic Duel anyway.  Why?  Here's another example of using the Red Queen principle to your advantage: your opponent, knowing a thing or two about Hunt Down decks, knows that you might duel him, and that losing a duel can really, really hurt.	So, if they think you can duel them, they'll play differently than if they think you can't.  More cautious in their deployments, and they'll hold onto their duel cards, maybe even throwing away essential cards because they can't afford the 9-15 force loss that would be coming their way if they lost.  It's the most useful card that's totally useless for you, but only because you know how he thinks you might play.<br>
<br>
So, what was the point of this article?  To help you focus a little better on metagame principles rather than on what to pack against certain decks.  Like they say, give a man a fish and he's full for a day; teach a man to fish and he'll never be hungry.  Look at the strengths and weaknesses of your opposition, and look at how you can turn all your disadvantages into advantages.  If one deck is popular, change your deck to accomodate it.  If the meta against a strategy is weak, take advantage of it.  Look at every possible way to enhance the parts of your strategy that can destroy theirs, and you'll have succeeded in building a great deck.<br>
