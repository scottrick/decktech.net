The original Chewbacca is extremely useful in cases.<br>
  -type of card-   -title-      -destiny-<br>
&quot;(Alien)(Rebel) o Chewbacca       1<br>
<br>
Power +1 at same location as Han.  Adds 2 to power of any starship he pilots.  On &lt;i&gt;Millenium Falcon&lt;i&gt;, also adds 1 to maneuever.  Your vehicles, starships, and droids at same site go to Used Pile (rather than Lost Pile) when they are &#146;hit&#146;.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, his text is not nearly as useful as Protector and he&#146;s not a scout and can&#146;t be searched for by Crix Madine.  However, he&#146;s the only Chewbacca that is an alien.  Why is this important?  Well, for one, he works with Bo Shuda, but that&#146;s not important.  The biggie is that he can be used as a Rep for Agents In The Court with Wookies!  I&#146;ve made a few decks with Chewbacca as the Rep (unfortunately, I only have 2 Chewbaccas and 5 Wookies).  And even with the shortage of cards, they were very good decks.  But for anything else, please go with the newer, better versions of him.<br>
<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve noticed a recent surge of space weapon decks using Ten Numb and the Blue B-Wings.  However, I haven&#146;t seen anyone use this card...<br>
<br>
&quot;(Weapon)  SW-4 Ion Cannon       5<br>
     -starship weapon-<br>
&quot;Use 1 Force to deploy on any Y-Wing or B-Wing.  May target using 1 Force.  Draw destiny.  If destiny &gt;target&#146;s armor or maneuver, all weapons aboard target are lost, defense value=0, and hyperspeed=0.&quot;<br>
<br>
This card is a beast in weapon decks.  Generic B-Wings add 3 to Ion Cannon destiny, so let&#146;s say they&#146;ve got Grand Admiral Thrawn and Commander Merrijik on the Chimaera.  You have Lt. Tarn Mison on a B-Wing Bomber with an Intruder Missle and Ten Numb on Blue Squadron 5 with SW-4&#146;s.  So, you have 12 power and the opponent has 13.  So you go ahead and battle, and fire your Ion Cannons at the Chimaera.  Since Ten Numb adds 2, and Blue Squadon 5 adds 2, you just draw a 3 and make him totally defenseless.  Now, you shoot your Intruder Missle at it, and since it&#146;s defense value=0, and your destiny is +3, it&#146;s automatically hit.  Since Lt. Tarn Mison makes all characters aboard forfeit =0, that&#146;s cool too, but it doesn&#146;t really matter in this example.  So, they draw their 2 battle destinies and you draw your one.  Let&#146;s say their total is 6, and your total destiny is 4.  So you have 16 power, and they have 19.  You forfeit Tarn Mison, and they lose the hole shebang.  Ouch.  Sucks to be them.  See how useful it is?<br>
<br>
<br>
You&#146;re All Clear Kid!  is useful in MBO decks.<br>
<br>
&quot;(interrupt)  o You&#146;re All Clear Kid!     3<br>
           -used interrupt-<br>
Cancel I&#146;m On The Leader. (immune to Sense.) OR Use 1 Force during an Attack Run.  Move One TIE in Death Star: Trench (your choice) to Death Star system for free.  Add 1 to total of Attack Run if lead starfighter has matching pilot aboard.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now you&#146;re probably thinking that sucks.  Well, for anything but MBO it does.  But this helps out MBO.  Adds 1 to desperately needed destiny for blowing up the Disco Ball?  Not bad.  It also gets rid of pesky TIEs from SYCFA TIE Swarm decks.  Limited, but useful in situations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alternatives To Fighting is a good evasive card.<br>
<br>
&quot;(interrupt) Alternatives To Fighting    3<br>
        -lost interrupt-<br>
Use 3 Force to cancel any battle at a system or sector.  OR Cancel Besieged.  OR Release (move for free) all your characters from a captured starship to your side of any docking bay site.&quot;<br>
<br>
The last 2 parts of this card are not so useful.  However, the first part is extremely useful.  It&#146;s basically Hyper Escape, except you can still stay at the location and beat them down next turn.  Or, in an Asteroid deck, this can be used to stay in hiding at the Big One, and they deploy PotF, you won&#146;t be unprepared.  Then they all get blown up next turn!  Not bad.  There are many uses, you can figure them out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eject, Eject!  is an absolutely INCREDIBLE card nowadays, in today&#146;s environment.  Observe...<br>
<br>
&quot;(effect) Eject! Eject!    4<br>
      -effect-<br>
Use 1 Force to target a starfighter&#146;s permanent pilot.  Draw destiny.  If destiny &gt;2, deploy on starfighter to remove permanent pilot (otherwise, Effect is lost).  May add 1 pilot (immune to Alter).&quot;<br>
<br>
This is absolutely HUGE.  Maybe you&#146;re thinking &quot;why is that so good?  TIEs suck!&quot;  Yes, maybe so (except Interceptors) and they are also rare-seen nowadays (at least I&#146;ve seen they are), however, Bounty Hunter ships are definetely seen all over the place.VERYONE plays them.  EVERYONE!  Let&#146;s see here, you can knock out Boba Fett, Zuckuss, Dengar, or IG-88 with a destiny 3.  Goodness gracias, that&#146;s incredibly useful.  I&#146;m not sure if their abilities can be used (like Zuckuss&#146;s 7 ability thing... anybody wanna clarify that for me?) but it&#146;s incredible.  It takes out 4 ability from Zuckuss so they can&#146;t draw destiny.  It takes out Boba Fett&#146;s drawing ability.  It takes out IG-88&#146;s 2 extra power and extra manuever.  It&#146;s so useful that way I don&#146;t see why space decks don&#146;t use it.  Or even ground decks (they have a lone Boba or Zuckuss, now they don&#146;t have any ability!).  It can also be used against a TIE heavy deck with SFS Lasers.  They can&#146;t shoot anything that doesn&#146;t have something to fire it, eh?  Knock out the SFS-carrier, and you&#146;re home-free.  Way too useful.  Also used on Obsidians, Black TIEs, etc etc etc.  Get rid of Scythe Squadron TIEs Tallon Rolling madness!<br>
<br>
<br>
Rebel Strike Team decks are insanely huge nowadays.  Here&#146;s a nifty card for them...<br>
<br>
&quot;(effect) Solomahal    4<br>
    -effect-<br>
Deploy on your warrior to give that warrior &lt;b&gt;scout&lt;b&gt; skill.  That warrior may move as a &#146;react&#146;.  OR Deploy on your scout.  When that scout &#146;reacts&#146;, it is power +2 for remainder of turn.  (immune to alter)&quot;<br>
<br>
This is one giant mofo.  The first part means you can deploy it on Crix Madine or even better, Obi-Wan With Lightsaber.  Heck, why not even Qui-Gon Jinn?  They can now react to a battle just initiated or a Force drain.  That&#146;s super-huge.  And, with Garrison Destroyed on table, they&#146;re immune to attrition &lt;4.  This part of the card is useful in any deck, not just Strike Team decks.  Reacting Qui-Gons are good no matter what deck you have.  Now, the second part is kind of lame, so I won&#146;t discuss that.  However, this card can be deployed on the same character twice to give them scout skill, then have them react and be power +2.  That&#146;s nasty with You Underestimate Our Chances.  Anyways, back to the first part, that&#146;s incredibly hugeness factor.  Obi-Wan With Saber REACTING and immune to attrition &lt;4 (one less than Obi-Wan Kenobi or Ben Kenobi, same as Padawan).  Not bad at ALL.  The only downfall is it&#146;s not immune to Alter.  But I rarely see SAC any more, so...  have fun with this card!<br>
<br>
<br>
There you have it.  My second part of thousands on this article series (well, maybe not thousands...).  If any of these cards have Erratas, please tell me, but don&#146;t knock me for them.  Also, if you know if Eject! Eject!  will stop the abilities, please tell me that too.<br>
<br>
PS - I have a question.  If I succeed in blowing up the Bunker on Endor, do I lose the Explosive Charges and Deactivate The Shield Generator BEFORE I retrieve, or AFTER I retrieve?  Any help on that would be appreciated.  Thank you!<br>
