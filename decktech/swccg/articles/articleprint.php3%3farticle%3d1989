submitted one to DeckTech. What better way to start<br>
contributing to the erudition of DeckTech members, I<br>
wondered, than to offer my own meagre insight into the<br>
current meta game and the cards that can tilt a game (or<br>
tournament) in your favor? So here it is:<br>
<br>
Josh Grace&#146;s Top 10 Cards for Every Deck<br>
<br>
10. Your Insight Serves You Well / You Cannot Hide Forever<br>
You Cannot Hide Forever doesn&#146;t show up in *every* one of<br>
my decks, but Insight does. Why? Because I HATE numbers.<br>
Has Decipher yet fired the designer who introduced numbers?<br>
If not, they should. Numbers are entirely contrary to the<br>
spirit of the movies (&quot;Let&#146;s see: my Vader and Tarkin go<br>
into the Cantina for a final confrontation with your<br>
Wioslea and two Eloms. Vader swings at an Elom. Destiny of<br>
2 and... insert &lt;POP&gt;... I lose 11 force and the game. Wow.<br>
That was fun.&quot;). And I HATE losing to numbers. Insight and<br>
You Cannot Hide fix that. The fact that they are immune to<br>
Alter is wonderful, and that they have additional effects<br>
just makes them all that much better. Even though numbers<br>
are dying off (because of these two cards), I can keep<br>
these cards in my decks in good faith because: 1) it&#146;s<br>
much easier to pack one of these than the 2 or 3 Don&#146;t<br>
Forget the Droids or Torture that I had to pack earlier, 2)<br>
they act as a free Signal (or Twi&#146;lek) for certain effects,<br>
and 3) the secondary effects of the cards ain&#146;t all that<br>
bad.<br>
<br>
9. Weapon Levitation (both sides)<br>
Ok, every once in a while, people end up playing those<br>
games where they deploy some stuff, their opponents deploy<br>
some other stuff and then they compare drain bonuses, wait<br>
a few turns and see who won. But usually players will find<br>
themselves in a battle or two, and on the ground weapons<br>
can have drastic impact upon battles, especially<br>
lightsabers. Weapon Levitation can be a gamebreaker. With<br>
its used ability, it&#146;s a trackable 4 destiny that can<br>
get that saber into the hand. With its lost ability, the LS<br>
can turn Vader, Tarkin and Dr. E from the Hit Squad of Doom<br>
into so much frustrated deploy cost. Likewise, the DS can<br>
turn Jedi Luke w/Saber into a destiny-cancellable power 6.<br>
Combined with a couple of force and a Clash of Sabers, the<br>
lost effect of Weapon Lev can burn the Vader/Tarkin combo<br>
quite badly. Or the Mara/Dr. E combo. Or, conversely, with<br>
2 force and You Are Beaten, the DS can smite any two mains<br>
running in with a saber. What Weapon Levitation usually<br>
means, though, in its lost form, is the difference between<br>
losing one or two characters: one to attrition and one to<br>
the slice, or only the one to attrition. In a game when<br>
battles swing back and forth, the loss of even a single<br>
character can prove disastrous. Also, it&#146;s nice to know<br>
that Vader w/Saber isn&#146;t going to show up when his saber&#146;s<br>
been stolen. Keep the new owner alive, and uniqueness<br>
blocks the EPPs deployment. Same for Obi or Luke and Luke&#146;s<br>
Saber.<br>
<br>
8. Zuckuss in Mist Hunter<br>
This one&#146;s a little painfully obvious folks. I won&#146;t<br>
belabour the issue. I&#146;ll only add that any card which can<br>
change the ENTIRE metagame (of how space is played) is<br>
worth inclusion in a deck. Xixor will be the same.<br>
<br>
7. Frozen Assets<br>
With or without Draw Their Fire, this card is a must in<br>
any battle-oriented deck. With all of the Barriers flying<br>
around and the continued possibility of You Are Beaten,<br>
this card provides a good measure of comfort in initiating<br>
a battle, ensuring that your well-planned beatdown doesn&#146;t<br>
backfire, derailed a turn only to be slammed by your<br>
opponent on his or her next turn. Additionally, despite all<br>
the battle-tested interrupts available, there are only so<br>
many that make it into a good number of decks, and of those,<br>
a player is likely only going to play with a couple copies<br>
of a couple cards. Combining Frozen Assets with Grabbers is<br>
nearly as effective as combining it with Draw Their Fire--<br>
even more effective in many cases, especially against Scum.<br>
Is your opponent playing Imperial Barriers, None Shall Pass,<br>
Projective Telepathy and Hidden Weapons? That&#146;s not<br>
uncommon. Grab a None Shall Pass and Hidden Weapons, save<br>
two additional force for the battle, deploy your Frozen<br>
Assets and launch your assault. Smackdown guaranteed.<br>
Is your opponent playing heavy SAC? Grab an Alter, then<br>
play Frozen Assets. No more Alter that turn. If you&#146;ve<br>
already grabbed a Sense, your interrupts are free to fly.<br>
Furthermore, many people don&#146;t realize how powerful Frozen<br>
Assets truly is. Not only does it prevent your opponent<br>
from using saved force during your turn, it prevents them<br>
from using that force on their next turn. Is your opponent<br>
saving massive amounts of force to send down the pain?<br>
Frozen Assets turns that around. You bring the pain, drain<br>
one turn, then back up your forces with a whole turn&#146;s<br>
worth of force (as much as they have saved, usually), and<br>
your on even footing against that beat down that was<br>
supposed to crush you. Nice.<br>
<br>
6. Secret Plans / Aim High<br>
Why don&#146;t more people play these cards? I read tournament<br>
reports here and continually find myself stupefied by the<br>
amount of force players are allowed to retrieve. With all<br>
the On the Edge/Off the Edge and Scum decks thriving, why<br>
aren&#146;t more players taking measures to stop retrieval?<br>
Sure, these two cards don&#146;t *prevent* retrieval, but Star<br>
Wars is a game of economy. When you&#146;re using force to<br>
retrieve, you&#146;re not using your force to strengthen your<br>
hold upon the galaxy. Force your opponent to pay to<br>
retrieve, and smart players will often skip the retrieval<br>
to pay for other game effects.<br>
Meanwhile, the secondary effects are more beneficial than<br>
they are usually given credit for being. Secret Plans<br>
allows for the continual searching of a deck, once each<br>
control phase. How often have you wanted to know what your<br>
destiny look like? Secret Plans will show you. And you can<br>
make your destiny better by using Secret Plans to pull a<br>
Used 5 each turn, Shocking Revelation (and with New Age<br>
Throneroom and Oola, that&#146;s not such a bad idea), which<br>
you can play right away. Aim High, on the other hand, adds<br>
a little extra punch to those EPPs with blasters: Han,<br>
Leia, Chewie and Lando. Combine two of them for +5 power.<br>
Battles are quite frequently decided by less than 5 power.<br>
With TIGIH and BHBM, that +5 power in a couple battles can<br>
be the difference between winning a game or losing it.<br>
<br>
5. Millenium Falcon / Gold Squadron 1<br>
Rather like Zuckuss, the Falcon needs little explanation.<br>
Except this shows up higher up the list because it&#146;s better.<br>
The Superfalcon is a beast without comparison. And Gold<br>
Squadron 1 with General Calrissian and Nien Numb (aka the<br>
Minifalcon) is a nice back-up if Han&#146;s got to go to ground<br>
or if you just want to block drains with TK-422 (&quot;Why<br>
aren&#146;t you at your post?&quot;). The Falcon, along with Vader<br>
and Obi, was the card which really taught players the<br>
meaning of &quot;Immunity to attrition less than X.&quot; Hordes of<br>
ships have gone up against the Falcon only to meet with<br>
the same fate, the inevitable play of Legendary Starfighter.<br>
Even if you&#146;re not playing space, only a starfighter to<br>
throw up with a Landing Claw, there&#146;s no ship better<br>
suited to the job than the Falcon. Attaching the Falcon to<br>
a capital class ship instantly means that your opponent<br>
must work harder to fortify that ship and its system. If<br>
they ever fail to do so, the Falcon can detach, supply your<br>
opponent with a heavy dose of reality, then blast almost<br>
all the way across the known galaxy only to attach to<br>
another ship and block a drain.<br>
<br>
4. What Are You Trying to Push on Us? / There&#146;ll Be Hell<br>
to Pay<br>
The grabbers. Even though the SAC scene has almost<br>
disappeared and is spotty at best, grabbers are as strong<br>
as ever, and more necessary than ever before. Respectfully<br>
disagreeing with the fellow who wrote about the new combo<br>
cards, grabbers are nowhere near dead. Combined with<br>
Impressive Enforcement or Wise Advice, grabbers offer (in<br>
my opinion) the best SAC control (in a deck without SAC).<br>
Even without the effects which allow your grabbers to<br>
deploy for free, grabbers are exactly the protection you<br>
need against losing to unexpected decks: Sabaac, Tallon<br>
Roll, Wookie Strangle, etc. The simple fact is this, many<br>
decks rely upon a few key Used Interrupts. There are two<br>
answers to key Used Interrupts. The first is SAC. SAC is<br>
not dead, but it suffered a heavy blow with the release of<br>
No Escape (which killed Honor against There Is No Try just<br>
after Honor had brought back the protracted Sense/Alter<br>
battles). The second answer is... grabbers, you bet. Grab<br>
that Imperial Command as early as possible, and space<br>
looks friendlier with each passing turn. If your opponent<br>
hasn&#146;t saved his 2 force, then you can launch the<br>
Superfalcon against Chiraneau in the Executor, optimistic<br>
about the outcome. If your opponent hasn&#146;t saved 2 force,<br>
you can initiate a battle with 4-Lom, IG-88 and Bane Malar,<br>
not fearful that the grabbed Fallen Portal is going to<br>
leave the pansy Bane fending for himself. They&#146;re also<br>
good for stopping those irritating destiny tracking cards,<br>
Masterful Move, Fall of the Legend, Out of Commission,<br>
Shocking Information, Operational as Planned, etc. Grabbers<br>
are gold. There&#146;s very little that&#146;s better. But there are<br>
a few cards... What are they? Keep reading...<br>
<br>
3. Vader<br>
It matters little if it&#146;s Darth, Dark Lord, Lord Vader,<br>
Vader with Saber--what have you. The man is an army unto<br>
himself. The jedi in the black mask is an Angel of Death<br>
to his enemies. With BHBM and Hunt Down, Vader can wipe<br>
out armies of your opponent&#146;s mains all by himself. No one<br>
is more central to the game than Vader. Except maybe Luke.<br>
And that&#146;s a maybe. Sure, I&#146;ll confess that some Scum<br>
decks can do without Vader, but then again, I&#146;ll note that<br>
many very good players have included Vader in very good<br>
Scum decks simply because no one else can go to a site<br>
and clean it out quite like Vader can. Vader in space<br>
ain&#146;t bad, but Vader on the ground is a site well-fortified.<br>
With all the Vader-oriented interrupts and effects and<br>
game mechanics, Vader is almost a deck design. I played a<br>
Hunt Down deck that had only Vader as a character, and it<br>
won half its games. No ships, no vehicles, no creatures.<br>
Just Vader. It was 50-50 against any LS deck.<br>
<br>
2. Luke<br>
With BHBM so popular, it&#146;s a fool that doesn&#146;t play with a<br>
copy of Luke in his deck. I typically play with 3, a<br>
Farmboy, Luke w/Saber and Jedi Luke. Jedi Luke, if nothing<br>
else, is a wonderful destiny waiting to be drawn. If you<br>
manage to get him to the ground, you may be aware of all<br>
the neat combos that can beat him. But have you stopped to<br>
consider why all those combos were popularized so quickly<br>
after DSII? Because Jedi Luke makes them necessary.<br>
Allowing any one character to be power 8, defense value 7<br>
and immune to attrition less than 7 for multiple turns<br>
is almost a cardinal sin. No character should be that<br>
powerful. Well, except for Jedi Luke, no character can.<br>
Luke is central to as many decks as Vader. Now that Jedi<br>
Luke is on the scene, he replaces Obi as the main dueler<br>
against Hunt Down. Sadly, you have to give up your Luke<br>
against BHBM, but until Vader shows up, Luke&#146;s a killing<br>
machine--deploy, die, deploy, die, ad infinitum. And<br>
Farmboy? I put him in there because Farmboy in space in<br>
R2 in Red 5 is nearly a second Falcon. It never hurts to<br>
drop a destiny 0 or 7 into the deck, and to allow the<br>
chance to make the most of the card, I put Farmboy in to<br>
pilot it. With Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader and<br>
Farmboy at one system (or on the ground, mind you) and<br>
Capn Han and Leia w/Blaster at another system, Zuckuss is<br>
typically S.O.L. But, really, Luke is in every deck because<br>
it&#146;s never bad to throw in a destiny 6 that can prevent<br>
you from losing 3 force at the beginning of each of your<br>
opponent&#146;s turns against a tremendously popular deck type.<br>
<br>
1. Traffic Control / Reactor Terminal<br>
Really these cards were the impetus for this article. They<br>
are almost unconciously included into every one of my<br>
decks, yet some of the other players in the local meta scoff<br>
at my old-fashioned ways. With all the used interrupts<br>
going around, the return of swarm decks where any one card<br>
is as good as any other, massive retrieval, and cards that<br>
let you search through your reserve deck, used pile or<br>
force pile for the cards you need, why would anyone still<br>
need Traffic Control or Reactor Terminal? Well, let&#146;s look<br>
at this question differently, shall we? If you&#146;re such a<br>
great player that you never lose and play only in<br>
tournaments that can produce only one undefeated player<br>
(by either a high number of rounds or small number of<br>
players), then you don&#146;t need these cards. But, if like<br>
most mere mortals, you can lose from time to time and<br>
the tournaments you attend often sort out the winners by<br>
differential, you may want to think again about the old<br>
ways. The main benefits of Traffic Control and Reactor<br>
Terminal are a smaller hand size and a larger differential.<br>
While having a good number of cards in your hand for most<br>
of the game offers a player more control over the immediate<br>
game as it develops, having a large hand size at the end<br>
of the game is an obvious disadvantage. How much of a<br>
disadvantage can your hand size be at the end of a game?<br>
Well, us mere mortals who lose from time to time find<br>
ourselves ranked among other players with an equal number<br>
of victory points but an uneven distribution of<br>
differential. A hand of 4 cards isn&#146;t that big at the end<br>
of a game is it? Not really. But just how big is that hand<br>
of 4 cards when you consider the entirity of a 6-game<br>
tournament? If at the end of the game, before you drained<br>
your opponent to death, you dropped those 4 cards back into<br>
your used pile, and if you did this each of the 5 games that<br>
you won, your differential increased by 20. How much is 20<br>
differential? It&#146;s usually enough to separate an entire<br>
group suspended at the same victory point level, meaning<br>
that in a tournament where 4 players went 5-1, typically<br>
they are within 20 differential of each other. Amongst the<br>
players that go 3-3, 20 differential can mean 5 to 10 places<br>
in a tournament of 30 to 40 players.<br>
<br>
Additionally, Traffic Control and Reactor Terminal remain<br>
the best ways to recycle cards since you don&#146;t run the risk<br>
of a grabber. That makes them the easiest way to track<br>
destiny. Plus, when you can keep your hand size low with<br>
these cards, you can draw for the combos that you need<br>
without so much fear of a Grimtaash/Monnok or fear that you<br>
will run out of force to use to deploy, battle and move.<br>
<br>
There you have it, then. Words of wisdom from the semi-wise.<br>
