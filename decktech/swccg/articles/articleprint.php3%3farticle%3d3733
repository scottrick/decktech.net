Building an effective deck is essential to anyone who wants to be a competitive player.  It takes time, effort, and a thorough knowledge of both the cards themselves and the tournament environment.  With this article I intend to provide a step-by-step approach to effective deck construction.  New players would do well to heed my advice, and older players who still have trouble putting a good deck together may benefit as well.  Here we go.<br>
<br>
KNOW YOURSELF<br>
<br>
Before you begin construction you need to ask yourself a few questions.  What style of play do you prefer?  Are you an active or reactive player?  Do you prefer a fast-paced game or a slow, controlled one?  Do you seek victory through battles, force draining, or other random strategies?  The answers to these questions will help you select the platform from which your deck will operate.<br>
<br>
CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON<br>
<br>
After you have answered the above questions, you should be ready to begin deck construction.  This is where you will choose the platform for your deck.  Do you wish to play with an objective?  If so, which one do you feel will allow you to effectively combat your opponent using your style of play?  Choosing your objective (or choosing none at all) is the first step in the construction process.  It will determine, to some degree, the focus of your deck.  Will you concentrate your forces in space, or at sites?  Will you attempt to create a balanced deck that can operate in both arenas?  Objectives tend to dictate where your strengths will be, though there are always exceptions.<br>
<br>
FOCUS, DANIEL-SAN<br>
<br>
After you have chosen which objective (or starting location) you intend to use, its time to focus your deck towards accomplishing your goals.  Most deck strategies center themselves around a specific card or group of cards working together.  For example, Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi focuses around Darth Vader, Visage Of The Emperor, and in many cases Epic Duel.  This is the foundation of your deck.  For this phase of deck construction, choose only the cards that you MUST have to make your deck work.  If you are playing with an objective, begin with the cards that the objective tells you to deploy at the beginning of the game.  If you intend to force drain, you need locations.  If you intend to battle, you need characters, vehicles and/or starships.  This is also where you should think about which starting interrupt and effects (if any) you will want to use.  By the time you are finished with this phase of construction, you will most likely have filled 15-50% of the available card slots in your deck.<br>
<br>
I NEED MORE SUPPORT!<br>
<br>
You have laid your foundation, now its time to build the frame.  The cards you select in this phase of construction should support your overall strategy.  This could mean choosing weapons your characters will use in battle, or which starships you want to control your systems with.  It is difficult to be specific here, because your support cards will depend on the focus of your deck.   The biggest difference between these cards and your focus cards is that these cards are more flexible.  Losing several of these cards may slow you down, but it SHOULD NOT cripple you.  When you are finished with this phase of construction, 50-85% of your card slots will likely be filled.<br>
<br>
ONE STEP CLOSER<br>
<br>
Next you will want to balance out some of your decks weaknesses.  The cards you include here are not essential to your strategy, and may not support it directly, but instead are here to increase your overall effectiveness or reduce your vulnerabilities.  At this point, you will want to take a look at different aspects of your deck; force generation and average destiny are good examples.  Do you activate enough force to effectively run your strategy without any force being provided by your opponent?  Once your locations and characters are in play will they be able to kill your opponent through attrition?  These are perhaps the broadest problems you will want to address in this phase.  You may also want to begin to include cards that reduce the effectiveness of your opponents&amp;#8217; decks.  If you know what decks are popular in your area, it will be easier to disrupt them.  Effects and interrupts are diverse and highly effective ways to do this.  You can reduce force drains, limit battle destinies, and retrieve force, etc. with these powerful cards.  Go through your collection and choose cards that will have the widest range of use.  By this phase of construction, you will not have enough available card slots to be using effects or interrupts that will only be useful once in a very long time.  Card efficiency is key.<br>
<br>
THE FINISHING TOUCHES<br>
<br>
So you think you have a great deck?  Well, here is your opportunity to make it better.  Play a few games with it.  Does it do what you wanted it to do?  How often are you able to make your strategy work?  Does the effectiveness of your deck rely on a lucky opening hand?  If so you may need to make a few changes.  Also, how well do your support cards and the other cards you have included compliment your deck?  Are you finding that your battle deck does not get the high destiny it needs to lay waste to your opponents&#146; forces?  If so, you may want to increase the average destiny of your deck by replacing low destiny cards with higher ones.  Or you may want to use destiny adders.   This is the point where you correct oversights you had when you first put the deck together.  Only you can decide what changes you need to make.  Maybe the change is fundamental, in which case you may want to start from scratch.  Hopefully though, by approaching construction in a step-by-step fashion, you will have a deck that is ready for tournament play.  <br>
