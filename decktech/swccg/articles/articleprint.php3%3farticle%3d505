     So here we are, Origins 2000. It's 2 hours before the big open and your anxious to get started. You know the prize, you know the champ that needs to be unseated, and you know your decks inside out. You've been waiting, and practicing for months for this tournament and now here it is only hours away from commencing.<br>
<br>
     So what do you do in the next two hours? Do you pick a corner and playtest with your best bud whose come along with you to play in the open with the same thing on his mind? Do you go around looking for cards that you'd like to have for your personal collection? OR Do you go around meeting people, greeting them with friendly hello's, smiles, and good luck wishings? The third choice is by far the best. You'll find that in greeting people you will end up making new friends as the day goes on, friends that you may keep for a lifetime.<br>

'Gentlemen, you are here today because you have earned your seat. Congratulations. But take a good look around you. These are the people who you will probably be friends with for the rest of your life.'<br>

-Juz Pakes (Day 1 of Worlds '99)<br>
<br>
     He couldn't have said anything more true. By the end of the Decipher Con weekend, I had made friends with so many of the 31 others, that I almost felt like I had known them for years.<br>
<br>
     Lets start off with a few points that you should read and take into account. Remember these when you go to your next tournament and try to apply them for they are the basis of your goal.<br>
<br>
<br>
1)********************************************************<br>
<br>
If there's one thing I want you to get out of this article it is the following so listen carefully. SWCCG IS A GAME. GAME'S WERE CREATED TO HAVE FUN. ENJOY YOURSELF... NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS. You must remember this whenever you decide to attend a tournament. Some people's way of having fun is different than others.<br>
This is ok.<br>
<br>
For you.<br>
<br>
But maybe not to other people. What counts in what we're trying to learn here is OTHER PEOPLE. Because that's how you make friends.<br>
<br>
For Example: If you have fun by beating up on little kids (or anybody) by winning with a 40+ differential, think about how the other person feels. You can do this as long as you do not talk behind the person's back with your other friends telling them how you destroyed this tiny scrub and how he doesn't deserve to even be at the tournament that you are competing in.<br>
<br>
I mean, sure you want to compete, and want to win the tournament, but...NO ONE RESPECTS a person who is arrogant, rude, and always plays JUST TO WIN. And isn't that what we all want? RESPECT? The desire to be important?<br>
<br>
If you are to win by this amount, try to help the person out after the game. Explain to him what he did wrong and how he can correct it. What cards can help his deck, and what cards could hurt it for future reference. This creates better players, respect for you, and a more friendly player atmosphere.<br>
<br>
THIS MAKES YOU AN IMPORTANT PERSON.<br>
<br>
Some local people that I have known for a while, always come to me for deck advice and support cause they know that I'm very friendly with them and will offer good and sincere help. They are great friends that I have acquired by offering my help and knowledge about deck building.<br>
<br>
Another important part of this section:<br>
NEVER COMPLAIN, CRITICIZE, OR CONDEMN<br>
Always try to help others when you can, without hurting them as a person. Their pride will always come back to haunt you as they devise ways to get even. Some of these plans aren't very pretty.<br>
<br>
People do not respect other people who are always moaning and groaning about this and that. They try to avoid them and make sure that they are not caught dead in association.<br>
<br>
Criticizing never helps unless its constructive, and taken by the person as such. If not, the criticism can be deadly and the cause of the person leaving SWCCG.<br>
<br>
NEVER CONDEMN<br>
BOTTOM LINE CAUSE DIVINE PROVIDENCE SAID SO. (You don't need to be a wrestler to use this line)<br>
<br>
Summary: Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain. Have Fun, but not at the expense of others.<br>
<br>
2)**********************************************************<br>
<br>
THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE<br>
<br>
'Everybody likes a compliment'<br>
-Abraham Lincoln<br>
'The deepest principle in human nature is the desire to be appreciated'<br>
-William James<br>
'Everything you and I do springs from 2 motives: the sex urge, and the desire to be great.'<br>
-Sigmund Freud<br>
<br>
Those quotes basically sum up the entire upcoming section.<br>
STOP. Read them again.<br>
<br>
Continue<br>
<br>
What do we want? We want to be respected. We want to be appreciated. We want to be GREAT. How are we going to achieve these goals when we have an army of enemies in the world who hate our guts and would give up their entire rares binder to have us assassinated?<br>
<br>
You cannot be great without friends. Many of them.<br>
You cannot be great with enemies.<br>
<br>
In a recent poll that was taken, this was what was discovered about what people want most.<br>
<br>
1) Health and the Preservation of Life<br>
2) Food<br>
3) Sleep<br>
4) Money and the things money will buy.<br>
5) Life in the hereafter.<br>
6) Sexual Gratification<br>
7) A feeling of importance.<br>
<br>
How can we achieve OUR feeling of importance?<br>
BY MAKING OTHERS FEEL IMPORTANT.<br>
<br>
By doing this you will not only make friends, influence people, but you will also acheive your personal feeling of importance which will probably lead you to the other 6 things that people want.<br>
<br>
You can do this by congratulating people for winning a game, asking them about what decks THEY prefer. What sort of tech THEY like to use. Make other people feel like they are king of the hill, and one day you will be too.<br>
<br>
Summary: Make others feel important. Become genuniely interested in other people.<br>
<br>
3)********************************************************<br>
<br>
This is the last one for this branch of the article because its getting way too long for anyone to be interested in reading. So here goes.<br>
<br>
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION IS TO SMILE.<br>
<br>
So many people do not know this that it astounds me. More importantly than the close you wear on your back, then the decks you've tweaked with for so long, is that smile on your face that EVERYBODY you come in contact with will see.<br>
<br>
This leads people to believe you are a friendly person. By acknowledging someone with a smile you are saying with body language, 'hello, I'm a friendly person' and that is sometimes all you need to make new friends. Start with a smile and you don't know where you could go.<br>
<br>
    An swccg player once smiled to another and became genuniely interested in what he was doing at a con the day before the big open. This same guy helped him out with his dark deck by suggesting him to take out a few cards and put in a couple others instead. The guy who initially smiled took the advice of his newly acquired friend, and took this same dark deck to his regional. He won it. Why? Because he had become genuinely interested in someone else, made friends by smiling, and decided that other people can help.<br>
<br>
The person who gave the advice: Frank Lamantia<br>
The person who utilized it and is very thankful every day for Frank's existance: ME<br>
<br>
Summary: Smile, Initiate conversation to show you are friendly.<br>
<br>
I hope you guys enjoyed the article, it took a while to write but I'm sure some of you will find its information extremely useful. Thanks for reading.<br>
