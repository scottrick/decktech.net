(by the way, I have written four in-depth articles concerning each one, check them out!)  I have seen articles like this before, so I'm combining both ECC and EJP so you can't say 'he's just copying everybody else.'  Remember, these are my opinions. . .<br>
<br>
Legend: D = deploy, F = forfeit, P = power, A = ability, M = maneuver H = hyperspeed<br>
(although destiny is important, I will only note it if it is significant)<br>
<br>
We'll start with EJP, since that's probably what you would want to read more.<br>
<br>
*Bossk with Mortar Gun - character<br>
D5, F3, P4, A2.<br>
Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots.	Permanent weapon is Bossk's Mortar Gun (may fire for free; draw destiny; may add or subtract 1 if at same site as a bounty; choose one character with that destiny number present to be captured).<br>
<br>
Interesting, we have another capture card.  My whole problem with it, though, is that it is very inefficient.  For deploy of 5, he isn't much to note.  His forfeit of 3 really turns me off, since he isn't that great anyway.  Plus ability 2 will not match up to anything, you deploy him and he dies in the next battle.  In my opinion, I would use Bossk in Hound's Tooth over this guy any day.  Combos: his weapon works better with bounties.  4 out of 10 stars<br>
<br>
*Dengar with Blaster Carbine - character<br>
D5, F3, P3, A2.<br>
Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots.	Permanent weapon is Dengar's Blaster Carbine (may target a character, creature or vehicle for free; target hit, and its forfeit = 0, if destiny +1&gt; defense value; may be fired twice per battle).<br>
<br>
This has the same problem as the new Bossk:  high deploy, low forfeit, and only good in specific uses.	His interesting weapon game text is what really makes him shine.  Notice that he can target vehicles and even fire twice!  Personally I look at this guy as another Ops wrecker.  Can you imagine deploying him, hitting the Op, hitting the Rebel Snowspeeder, then moving on to the next site, blocking a drain and then doing it again.  Combos: he techs against Ops, so use him with other cards that counter it.	6 stars<br>
<br>
*Jodo Cast - character<br>
D4, F3, P3, A3, ARMOR5.<br>
When in battle, if opponent draws more than one battle destiny, may cancel one.  Once per turn, when firing a rifle or blaster, may target for free and add 2 to total weapon destiny.	May be targeted by Hidden Weapons.  May 'fly' (landspeed = 3).<br>
<br>
This guy I like, I love the smell of Mandalorian weapons in the morning!  His deploy 4 and forfeit 3 are made up by his game text, which I am thrilled about.  First, his battle destiny cancelling is great, just great.  Put him with Vader and Tarkin and you have a great beatdown crew who can wreck Ops and nearly anything else.  His weapon firing text also has sparked my imagination, using some weapons with him would be incredible.  He and Dr. Evazen used in tandem would be very beneficial.  And, of course, you can use Hidden Weapons with him, and he flies with a landspeed of 3.  His one downside is that Jodo isn't a pilot, what a pity.  Combos: Vader + Tarkin + Jodo Cast.  Jodo Cast + Ponda Boba's Hold-Out Blaster (fire for free, it's destiny +3, and if he hits it's forfeit = 0).  Jodo Cast + any rifle/blaster + Dr. Evazen.	7 stars<br>
<br>
*Mara Jade, the Emperor's Hand - character<br>
D5, F7, P4, A5.<br>
Adds 2 to power of anything she pilots.  Power +2 if Emperor on table.	May be targeted by Vader's Obsession and Epic Duel instead of Vader.  Once per game, may deploy a weapon on her from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.	Immune to attrition &lt;4.<br>
<br>
There is a lot to say about this card.	If you don't mind, I'll even use quote some info from 'The Deadly Mara Jade' (sorry, author, I can't remember your name).	One thing I didn't put on the text was that she's a spy.  This allows her to go, 'where no power character has gone before', so to speak.  She is power +2 if Emperor on the table, which is notable since Death Star II comes out in the near future.  She can be a good pilot, but you would be mis-using her if you did that.  What's better is that she can be used in regular Vader's Obsession AND in an Epic Duel with Luke.  This opens a multitude of possibilities for Hunt Down decks.  Now you can have Vader go after Obi-Wan, and Mara Jade go after Luke.	So, the opponent's going to split Luke and Ben up?  Well I'll split my bad boy and bad girl up and go after them seperately.	There are many options for you, but I won't go into all of them.  Probably her best text, though, lets her deploy any weapon on her from reserve deck.  Obviously, you will want to use Mara's Saber on her most of the time, which is what is best on her.  However, caution is needed, you might see Away Put Your Weapon take out that Saber on your Force drain.	Since she is an imperial and alien, you can use all sorts of 'alone' interrupts on her, Moment of Triumph, Lone Warrior, and Vader's Eye.  Even throwing one of those in could help you.  There are also some counters against her.	Most notably, Double Agent is a threat, since most people use a spy or two for counter Visage.	R-3P0 could also get annoying.	Combos: 'alone' interrupts + Jade, big powerful weapons (especially sabers) + Jade.  9 stars<br>
<br>
Mara Jade's Saber doesn't need a review, it just accompanies her, and the text is standard.<br>
<br>
*IG-88 in IG-2000 - starship<br>
D5, F4, P3, M3, H3.<br>
May add 2 passengers.  Permanent pilot is IG-88, who adds 2 to power and 3 to maneuver.  May initiate battle.  When in a battle you initiate, adds one battle destiny.	Ion Cannon may deploy aboard.<br>
<br>
This is, essentially, the IG-88 with Riot Gun in space.  Those three magic words 'may initiate battle' just kick.   Not only that, WHENEVER you initiate the battle, you get an extra destiny.  Rock on Iggy...  But in my opinion, Iggy belongs on the ground, so it is pretty much a meta choice.  Great card, but in my opinion not as good as Riot Gun Iggy.  Watch out for Eject Eject!	Combos: Lone Pilot + Iggy's ship; deploy Lateral Damage, deploy Iggy's ship, quick battle, and you can't get beaten back; Court of the Vile Gangster + Iggy's ship; lots of ability + Iggy's ship.  7 stars<br>
<br>
*Zuckuss in Mist Hunter - starship<br>
D6, F5, P2, M3, H5.<br>
May add 1 pilot and 3 passengers permanent pilot is Zuckuss, who provides ability of 4 and adds 2 to power.  Unless opponent has total ability &gt;6 piloting here, opponent's total battle destiny here = zero.<br>
<br>
This one just makes me think 'poor Light Side...'  This basically ruins Light Side space because it almost requires Light to hold systems with seven ability, or else destiny won't even exist for them.  In addition, Zuckuss gets a destiny on his own!  Wow, this will definitely replace Zuckuss in most of my decks.  Also, it is perfect if used with IG-88 in ship since you get two destiny immediately.  Combos: Lone Pilot + Z'man, Court of the Vile Gangster + Z'man, IG-88 in ship + Z'man.	9 stars.<br>
<br>
*Boushh - character<br>
D6, F7, P3, A4, ARMOR4.<br>
Deploys only to a site (-2 on Tatooine or Coruscant) as an Undercover spy.  While Undercover at an opponent's site, prevents opponent from modifying your Force drains at opponent's related sites.  Immune to attrition &lt;3.<br>
<br>
This card opens some new possibilities for non-interaction decks that use stuff like Arconas and undercover spies to do the dirty work, while allowing the space fleet to do the battling and Force draining.  She also has the unique ability of preventing your opponent from modifying your drains at OPPONENT'S related sites.  This could be a significant asset if playing against Ops or ISB.  She might actuallly be useful in that way.  Unfortunately, she is limited to being undercover unless your opponent breaks the cover.  That, to me, is annoying because I would have liked to break her cover and battle with her, while still keeping that special text.  Now I know that if her cover is broken, she can't use her text in that way, but that's big D's fault.  Shame on them...  By the way, why on earth do you think she has an armor of 4?  Doesn't her ability 4 protect her the same way already?  Well that just is stupid, at least they could have given her armor 5.  Combos: TK-422 + Tamtel Skreej + Boushh + Arcona's + space!  6 stars<br>
<br>
*Master Luke - character<br>
D7, F7, P6, A5.<br>
Deploys -2 on Tatooine.  Power -2 when present with Vader.  Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots.  When in battle, may target one opponent's alien present.  Draw destiny.  Target returns to your opponent's hand if destiny &gt; ability.	Immune to attrition &lt;4.<br>
<br>
This is definitely the best Light Side card out of EJP.  The only 'insignifigant' stuff to note is that he deploys less on Tatooine and is power -2 when present with Vader.	But his great stuff comes from his 'character removal' text.	You essentially just send aliens back to the opponent's hand!	All you have to do is draw destiny &gt; ability.  This is perfect for taking out that annoying Fett with Blaster, Jodo Cast, Dengar, OPERATIVE, Kitik Keed'kak, or other alien.  I especially like this since you can take out Operatives in one swift stroke, then beat up on everything else.  DIE OPS!!!  His immunity to attrition &lt; 4 is just icing on the cake.  Combos: Master L + Sabers, of course; Ben Kenobi + Master L, of course, as your 2 man wrecking crew; Master L + EJP Light objective, duh.  8 stars<br>
<br>
*See-Threepio- character<br>
D3, F4, P1.<br>
Deploys only to a Jabba's Palace site.  Once per game, when replacing another C-3P0, retrieve 3 Force.  When in battle with your other droid and a Rebel, adds one battle destiny.  R2-D2 deploys and moves for free to this location.<br>
<br>
Can you say worthless?	This card stinks worse then old cheese.  You might be able to use the stuff about adding a destiny in an EJP objective deck, but overall this card is just going to rot in my binder.  And this retrival couldn't be worse.  I will not EVER sacrifice 2 card slots to retrieve only 3 force once in a game.  Gee, what was Decipher thinking... Combos: every single one is way too card intensive.  1 out of 10 stars.<br>
<br>
Ok, now we go on to ECC.  Bear with me, I'm sure you've seen this before, but at least you can't say I didn't put much info in this article...<br>
<br>
*4-LOM with Concussion Rifle -- character<br>
D3, F3, P2, ARMOR3.<br>
Adds one battle destiny if with Jabba or Zuckuss.  Permanent weapon is 4-LOM's Concussion Rifle (may target a character for free; target may not use its game text for remainder of turn).<br>
<br>
This card rocks.  He is essential to ground forces, for his text can be a deciding factor in many battles.  Decipher created this card for the purpose of  curbing the use of EPP mains everywhere, although even that hasn't stopped.  He does, however, allow you to take an advantage which, in my opinion, makes him a great character for any Dark ground deck that doesn't use AT-AT's.  Use him to take out that lone 'immune to attrition' Obi-Wan, or just prevent Ben from reviving anybody.  Take out Han w/Heavy's game text, preventing Light Side from drawing that extra destiny.	He is also useful for battling in that he adds a destiny if with Jabba or Zuckuss.  This is just icing on the cake.  Imagine using Boba Fett w/Gun, Jabba the Hutt, 4-LOM w/Gun, and Boelo and you have a nearly invincible squad!  Unfotunately, he has a medium defense value and he isn't immune to Restraining Bolt and purchase by Wioslea, which tech pretty well against him.  Combos: refer above, I named all of them.  I'd give this card 7 out of ten stars.<br>
<br>
*IG-88 with Riot Gun - character<br>
D5, F3, P4, ARMOR5<br>
May initiate battle.  Permanent weapon is riot gun (may target a character for free; draw destiny; target captured if destiny +1&gt; defense value).  Adds one battle destiny if alone or with your other bounty hunter.  Immune to Restraining Bolt and purchase.<br>
<br>
My, my, what do we have here!  This card is still changing the game, for this Iggy is awesome!	There are limitless possibilities for this one man beatdown crew!  Note those three magic words 'may initiate battle.'  Gee that just sends chills up my spine... whew...  His weapon rocks, considering that takes the guy out of the battle immediately.  Having a battle destiny if alone is incredible.  Considering this, I would have to say just having Iggy in is Operatives protection.  You battle, capture the Op, kill the speeder with destiny, move to the next site, which kills the Op you have captive, repeat.  Nice.  In addition, he adds a destiny if with another bounty hunter.  This is ANOTHER addition to the alien/droid beatdown crew (mentioned previously)!  Last but not least, he is nearly impossible to hit with a weapon and can't be taken out by restraining bolts and purchase.  Arguably the best card in ECC.  Combos: himself alone is a combo, I named the others.  9 stars.<br>
<br>
*Boba Fett in Slave I - starship-  otherwise known as Bubble Boy!<br>
D7, F4, P4, M4, H4.<br>
May add 3 passengers.  Permanent pilot is Boba Fett, who provides ability of 3, adds 3 to power, adds 2 to maneuver and draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise.  Immune to attrition &lt;5.<br>
<br>
This, to me, is my favorite card from ECC (maybe not the best, but my favorite).  The Bubble Boy is arguably the best DS ship in the game at the moment, since the Executor doesn't draw destiny on its own.  Deploying for 7 and having a power of 7 kicks that lone Red Leader out the window and down the sewer, and stands its ground with an immunity to attrition of 5.	Wow! I think the only problem with this is that if you want to use this in space, you can't use Fett on the ground.  And then there's Eject Eject.  Oh well... Combos: Court of the Vile Gangster + Bubble Boy,  Bubble Boy alone.  9 stars.<br>
<br>
*Dengar in Punishing One - starship<br>
D5, F5, P2, M5, H3.<br>
Permanent pilot is Dengar, who provides ability of 2 and adds 2 to power.  When in battle adds 1 to total battle destiny for each opponent's starship present.  Cancels opponent's immunity to attrition here.<br>
<br>
'Rocket Man' is becoming essential in all Dark decks, solely because you cancel the opponent's immunity to attrition there.	Can you say 'goodbye Falcon?'  I thought so.	With this card X-wing swarm is a thing of the past, since you just add to your battle destiny for each card they deploy...  I can't say enough about this card.  Combos: Court of the Vile Gangster + Rocket man (are you catching the trend here?), tech against Hidden Base.  8 stars<br>
<br>
*Crush the Rebellion -- Effect -- Destiny 4<br>
Deploy on table.  Once per turn, may take I Have You Now or Evader into hand from reserve deck; reshuffle.  At mobile sites, opponent draws no more than two battle destiny per battle.  Evader is immune to Sense.  May lose 1 force to cancel Clash of Sabers.  (Immune to Alter.)<br>
<br>
This card changed the game, I repeat, this card changed the game!  This literally took out Clash of Sabers from every SWCCG player's vocabulary.  It also changed how the Light side plans its attack upon almost anything.  No longer can you count on multiple destinies or Clash Of Sabers.  Even Revo has been hurt enough that people have to build decks with counters to this already in them!	Though this hasn't killed Throne Room Tech decks yet, and I don't anticipate that it will, it has struck a blow.  Being able to take I Have You Now into hand also opens up new possibilities for Hunt Down gaming.  Incredible card.  Combos: useful in Hunt Down and This Deal decks, and then again in just about any deck.  9 stars<br>
<br>
*Any Methods Necessary - used or starting interrupt - destiny 4<br>
USED: Activate 1 force.  STARTING:  Take into hand from reserve deck one prison and one bounty hunter (may also take a matching weapon and/or starship).  When you draw your starting hand, draw six more cards instead of eight.  Place interrupt in Reserve Deck.<br>
<br>
This, to me, was not a very significant advancement in Dark decks.  However, in many decks, such as This Deal or Vile Court decks, this can provide you with a quick advantage.  Taking a prison into hand is also beneficial since it gives you that extra Force.  All in all, there aren't many combos with it, but it can be used to your advantage.  7 stars<br>
<br>
*Lando with Blaster Pistol - character<br>
D4, F5, P3, A3.<br>
Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots.	Adds one battle destiny if with your other alien on Cloud City.  Permanent weapon is blaster pistol (may target a character for free; draw destiny; target hit, and its forfeit = 0, if destiny +1&gt; defense value).<br>
<br>
This card now has two primary usages:  Cloud City decks and You Will Profit decks.  Your added battle destiny on Cloud City is great when used with multiple aliens.  He also has the typical weapon game text that we all love.  Good card overall, and fairly efficient for its purpose.  Combos: Lando + Cloud City/You Will Profit decks.  7 stars<br>
<br>
*Chewie with Blaster Rifle - character<br>
D5, F5, P6, A2.<br>
Adds 3 to power of any freighter he pilots.  Adds one battle destiny if with C-3P0.  Permanent weapon is blaster rifle (may target a character or creature for free; draw destiny; target hit, and its forfeit = 0, if destiny &gt; defense value).<br>
<br>
It's kind of sad to say, but this really is the best Chewie we have (unless you want a lower deploy cost).  It is unfortunate, though, because he has a wimpy weapon.	I've been pondering this for a while, because doesn't Chewie ALWAYS shoot right?  For goodness sakes, isn't he on the Blaster Proficiency picture???  Adding one destiny with Threepio is virtually useless since no one actually wants to include him.  Oh well, we can't have everything.  No really good combos are available right now.  6 stars.<br>
<br>
***Z-95 Defense Fighter - starship<br>
D2, F3, P2, M4, H2.<br>
Permanent pilot provides ability of 1 and adds 1 to power.  May add one alien pilot (suspends permanent pilot).  Power +2 at Bespin locations.	May be carried aboard starships like a vehicle.<br>
<br>
The best usage for this card is in a Quiet Mining Colony deck, period.	For that reason, it is a great card.  Really, it has a power five at the Bespin system and Cloud City, 3 in the clouds, and that's not even counting if you have a pilot on it or not.  It's perfect with Boshek, Melas, or Leselomy Tacema.	Since it is an independent starship, Local Defense adds to its defensive capability.  Combos: Melas/Boshek/Tacema + Z-95, QMC + Z-95.  7 stars<br>
<br>
*Lando in Millenium Falcon - starship<br>
D5, F6, P3, M3, H5.<br>
May add 1 pilot and 2 passengers.  Permanent pilot is Lando, who provides ability of 3 and adds 3 to power.  May not be piloted by Han unless he won a hand of sabacc this game.  Immune to attrition &lt;5.<br>
<br>
Well if you really want Han on the ground, and you're not using Lando, this card is a must-have for your space fleet.	With an inherent power 6, ability 3, and immunity to attrition &lt;5, add a pilot and you have a great all-purpose starship!  Great card, you just have to hope your opponent isn't using a Dark Lando.  Combos: Falcon + Wedge, Falcon + Special Modifications, Falcon + Landing Claw.  8 stars<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I would have to say the Dark Side got the better part of the deal.  Since, then, Dark has the advantage, Light has to be inventive and be willing to take risks.  The better part of valor makes me want to be very cautious and careful anticipating the local meta and what cards and objectives will be used.  Still, the Light Side has many powerful assets that are just waiting to be found, we just have to unlock them....<br>
