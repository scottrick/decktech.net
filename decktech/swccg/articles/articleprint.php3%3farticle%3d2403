As for the players, we would mostly rather play the game than attempt to solve it. Given that each new set introduces new variables, it would be futile, anyway, to attempt to solve the game until it was dead. And then no one would care.<br>
<br>
What good players ARE able to do is think of the algorhythm in gestaltic terms. Perhaps, we are unable to envision each and every variable, but we are able to identify certain key points, certain limiting factors, and then to create strategies which synthesize the most important elements of any deck along with the strategy by which the deck is played. The selection of KEY variables is, in essence, a matter of economics. In prioritizing one aspect of the game, a good player acknowledges the existence of an alternative aspect, but deems it of lesser benefit for an equal or greater cost. In other words, good players know which blend together better in certain deck types.<br>
<br>
How do you determine the efficiency of any given card? Again, the whole question is a vast, complex mathematical conundrum, but keeping in mind a few relatively simple principles, you can develop a strategy and a maching deck that efficiently and effectively matches your playing style.<br>
<br>
As an example, I present my Save You It Can, Apocalyptic, a jedi training deck that trains Luke. People have told me how this deck is an auto-loss to all sorts of decks, especially Hunt Down, BHBM and AoBS. Yet, I consistently win with the deck because it EXACTLY matches my playing style, card for card. I play to establish as much control over the tempo of the game as possible, forcing my opponent to act and allowing myself to react to his decisions. In order to establish the type of control that allows you to be the reactive player, you have to understand how to limit the options you allow your opponent.<br>
<br>
The principle limiting factor in any game of Star Wars CCG is the deck size. Given an infinite number of cards, you could work any amount of activation and deploy any number of cards and battle with any combinaton of interrupts. However, that game would also last an infinite amount of time with no resolution. Instead, we are limited to 60 cards, and with those 60 card slots, we are confronted with the task of creating a coherent strategy that can defeat coherent strategies handled by other players. Having a deck size confined to 60 cards also places boundaries upon: 1, the ability to draw cards 2, the ability to activate force 3, the ability to deploy cards 4, and everything else, of course, however indirectly.<br>
<br>
The ability to draw cards is important, but, even more important than the ability to draw cards is the ability to draw the RIGHT cards. If you limit the amount of force your opponent can activate by using a force-choking deck or a deck that makes deploy costs or force drains expensive, then you limit the number of cards your opponent can draw. As long as you are making him use force for some reason, that used force is no longer available to his hand. Classic hand manipulation through Monnok, Miyoom Onith, Scanning Crew and A Dangerous Time has been a longtime staple of the dark side. However, hand manipulation can be subtler as well. Against my SYIC deck, my opponent is forced to pay for each drain, thereby losing a potential 3 card draw, or establish forces at both a battleground site and system, therby prematurely revealing and exposing his forces. If your opponent has played Zuckuss in MH at one system, he can hardly deploy another copy against your ships wherever they go. The same goes for Vader. Forcing your opponent to waste potential draws and to reveal his hand early is, then, a subtle form of manipulation, at least to the minds that are able to make use of the information they are thus presented.<br>
<br>
Again, a deck is limited by how many cards it can devote to the activation of force. Every player who has any history of experience knows the sickening feeling of the dreaded Force Choke. There are various ways to establish a force choke against your opponent. The classic method is the Twix and Revo method, giving your opponent no icons and stealing most of his. Other cards like Nudj and Sleen accomplish a similar feat. However, cards like Goo Nee Tay and Bad Feeling Have I can also force choke an opponent because the force a player activates means nothing on its own until it can be considered in terms of what options it allows that player. If those options are limited by the suddenly prohibitive costs of the cards in his hand, the player is now force choked. Again, if the player has to pay 3 force for each of his drains as is commonly the case aganst my SYIC, the player has to reconsider what options are available during the other phases and is, again, force choked. In order to get past Battle Plan and stave off the force choke, my opponent has to provide a battle ground site and system of his own, thereby reducing his potential differential by not only the number of locations but also by the cards used to occupy those locations. This is the beginning of the limitation opposed upon deployment.<br>
<br>
Each card you deploy during a game of Star Wars, unless you are running consistent retrieval, is a card that you lose. The object of the game, then, is to do as much as possible with as little as possible. Against a deck that aims for a lock-down, like my SYIC deck, a player will need to cause a lot of damage early before the lock-down is in effect. This is also true against the type of deck, like EBO, that explodes exponentially in the amount of damage that it can do. Unless, you are sufficiently prepared by the time such a deck takes effect, all the damage that you start suffering will end up controlling your response. With nothing left to do but try to stop the bleeding, you will be FORCED to follow the path down which your opponent is leading you. Deployment, then, is not merely a matter of HOW MUCH but also a matter of WHEN and WHERE. Again, a deck like my SYIC relies upon its ability to prematurely force my opponents hand. The threat of a suicide Obi is usually enough to cause a player to back up his Vader, Xixor or Emperor. Similarly, the threat of a SuperFalcon is enough to force a player to deploy en masse to space rather than one little ship at a time. If my opponent does not play toward safety, he usually finds himself suffering for his foolishness. And, thus, all of those cards that get deployed to the purpose of fortifying one location or another will typically be lost cards in the greater scheme once I deploy my cards elsewhere. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, there are only three ways of causing damage to your opponent: 1, force draining 2, battle damage and 3, direct damage. Against a deck like my SYIC, force draining becomes less of a valid option, with force drain bonuses cancelled and Battle Plan in play, in order to drain efficiently, my opponent must spread both to ground and space. Because my opponent has only 60 cards in his deck and does not want to use all of those slots for cards with power--typically 20 to 30 cards will have ability--my opponent will eventually be force to spread his forces thin enough for my ultra-efficient SuperFalcon to take out a system or for any combination of Obi with Saber, Lando with Axe, Melas and Luke with Saber to clear out a site. Also, because I do not offer either a battleground system or site for my opponent to use to satisfy Battle Plan until I deem it appropriate, my opponent is forced to draw for and deploy all of the cards himself in order to drain effectively. Each card my opponent deploys is one less card I need to make him lose. And by limiting the potential sites of conflict, I can play reactively, either waiting for my opponent to leave an opening for a battle at a location or to over-deploy, leaving me free to set up at one of my battleground locations.<br>
<br>
This brings us to battling. Dedicated force drain decks rarely have solid forces with which to battle, and this is part of the reason the game has shifted away from decks like Dark Deal and clouds toward all the current variants of Mains and Toys. A couple of decks, like EBO and MKOS, still favor the draining to the battling, but given all the ways of shutting down drain bonuses with Menace Fades, Imperial Decree, Test 1 and ISB, good players are increasingly looking at winning the game through slow but steady drain pressure coupled with opportunistic battles. Again, in battling, the game is a matter of economics. Simply put, a character like Choke Lord or IG-88 or any EPP is worth two characters if they can hit one and cause another to die with attrition. Some key interrupts, like Fallen Portal and I Know, show up frequently because of their cost effective impact upon battles. Anyone who has ever lost a game because of the Draw Their Fire and Frozen Assets combo can attest to the economics of the game. When each interrupt requires a force to play and is then denied that force, you realize how clearly each card has a COST. With my SYIC, then, playing reactively, I can determine fairly clearly what the cost of each of the battles I initiate will be. Furthermore, I can determine whether or not the outcome will be worth the cost. It is worthwhile, to me, to stack a force on I Feel the Conflict in order to suicide Obi Wan and slice Vader in a battle. That pays off in the long run. However, if Vader is backed up by about 5 characters, and I would end up taking overflow from the battle, I will typically refrain from battle and opt, instead, to deploy a character elsewhere and use On the Edges to recover from the damages I suffer.<br>
<br>
Direct damage is the most efficient way of forcing your opponent to lose force because it typically requires fewer cards than establishing force drains or winning battles. Accordingly, my SYIC which is ultra-efficient against force-draining and battle-oriented decks has its toughest match-ups against direct damage decks like Hunt Down, BHBM and AoBS. This is why when I submitted my decklist, several people told me I would have an auto-loss against any such deck. The fact that such decks provide difficult match-ups hardly accounts for the use of the term auto-loss. Rather, it merely makes for a more engaging game. Here, multiple principles of economics coincide. With only one card, Honor of the Jedi, I can force my opponent to either draw for a No Escape or spread out to three battlegrounds. Certainly, any good opponent is going to be able to, at some point, suspend HotJedi. Yet, even then, my deck is efficient in its response. I do not need to confront my opponent at all three battlegrounds. I merely need to wipe out one of them, typically the system. If I can do that, and No Escape is not yet in play, then I have once again put HotJedi into effect.<br>
<br>
The impact of HotJedi upon the game is a study of how a strategy can center upon one card with complete and total efficiency. As I mentioned, with one card, unless my opponent has one of those opening hands players fantasize about, I can force my opponent to either 1, spend time drawing for No Escape or 2, spread out to three battlegrounds. Again, if my opponent spreads out to three battlegrounds, I have the chance to react against the weakest of the three. The efficiency of suicide EPPs along with retrieval makes the occupation of the third battleground a losing proposition in most games. If my opponent spends his time trying to get No Escape, that may cut into the force he is using to drain or cut into the opportunities he has to get out such anti-retrieval cards as Secret Plans and Something Special Planned for Them. Remember, the complaint against training Luke is that it allows my opportunity all of these chances to hit me with direct damage. However, this complaint is only valid so long as Luke is on Dagobah and not at a battleground site. Once my objective flips and I play Test 6 to pick up Luke and play him to a battleground site, the worries over the direct damage end. Until then, I simply have to keep in the game. So, I repeat myself, if my opponent manages to draw for No Escape, that decreases his ability to get both Secret Plans and Something Special, allowing me greater opportunity to retrieve with On the Edge and, then, the flip of my objective.<br>
<br>
Since I am the type of player who prepares for the worst-case scenario, I expect to spend 10 force to retrieve 10 in every game. This means that I expect, upon the completion of Test 5, to have at least 20 force in my life force. My opponent, likely, will have deployed a good number of cards, may have lost a couple, and should not have more than 40 cards between hand and life force. This means that upon the completion of Test 5, I expect, in order to win, to be able to do better than 2 to 1 damage to my opponent. Most of the time, this works. In situations where my opponent does get one of those fantastical hands, I have to play with close, detailed attention to the amount of cards in my reserve, used and force piles. The object of the game is to flip Test 5 with a 7-destiny and retrieve 10 force. In order to pay for Secret Plans, I need to stay above 10 force in my life force through the completion of Test 5. This means that against an effective Hunt Down or BHBM, I will probably need to play both copies of On the Edge before the flip. So, while, my opponent is using his force to drain and deploy, I will use my force to deploy and retrieve. This would still be a losing battle for me if it was not for the fact that, as I said, after I deploy Test 6, the direct damage woes of BHBM, AoBS and Hunt Down are put on hold when I deploy Luke.<br>
<br>
Even more in depth, as I stated in my MN States tournament report, if I am not losing 3 or more force a turn while working through my jedi training, I should win the game. This is how it breaks down. It takes me roughly 8 turns to complete Test 5. If I am losing 3 force a turn, that comes to 24 force throughout those 8 turns. With a reasonable estimation of my cards deployed at 21, that accounts for 45 of my 60 force. That leaves me with 15 between my hand and life force. When I start Test 5, I will make certain that I will have sufficient force to activate, meaning 10, in order to retrieve. On the turn that I am set to complete Test 5, I will recycle 3 force with Traffic Control, placing a 7 on the top which will be drawn when I complete Test 5 and flip, along with whichever the second card is that I recycle. The third recycled card is to be left in the reserve after the cycle as my destiny which I MAY draw to satisfy the INSTEAD OF DRAWING clause on Test 5. After completing Test 5, I pay my 10 force to retrieve and, suddenly, I have 22 life force minimum, the best two cards to lead to a swift counter against my opponent in my hand, and the opportunity to search my reserve deck with Test 4 for the third best card to use against my opponent. This is all hypothetical, of course, as most of the time, I will not even lose 3 force a turn since I rarely start taking damage until the dark side has its third turn.<br>
<br>
Now, maybe you are wondering how this applies to decks other than mine. Quite understandable. Jedi training is not for everyone. It has incredible benefits, but it also requires massive investments in attention, foresight and precaution. Yet, to play any deck that intends to set up a lock-down, you must plan against the worst-case scenarios, how to cope with the situations that are most difficult to pin into a corner. For an ISB deck like Retardosaurus Rex, this means that you need to have a contingency plan for when your opponent is hitting you with fast, early damage while you are setting up. A deck like Profit could cause woes with its direct damage and its cheap, early mains running around with Order to Engage in play. Conversely, one can learn how to play against the lock-down by coming to a better understanding of its mechanics. Lock-down decks: 1, take time to set up 2, force you into poor economic situations in order to reduce your viable options and 3, still need to have a way to cause you damage, typically by setting up en masse at one or two of their own locations. Against the lock-down, you want to 1, cause damage early, taking a little risk when the chances are lower that your opponent will have the right cards to make you pay for your audacity 2, refuse to trap yourself into poor economic situations by allowing your opponent to escape a couple of force loss if it means that you can set up free drains or set up additional direct damage and 3, deploy to prevent the beat-down but withhold from over-deployment. <br>
<br>
Every deck has a few pivotal cards. Learn which cards are central to the strategy to a deck and you begin to understand how best to counter the deck. To repeat the opening analogy, if a game of Star Wars is like a complex mathematical problem, which it is, you simplify the equation each time you can reduce the effectiveness of any given card or combination of cards to ZERO. Again, the players who succeed are those who can analyze a situation within the time constraints of the game and discern which elements are key to their strategies and those of their opponents. They then respond by coming up with the least expensive, most effective answer to that obstacle. At the end of the game, the measure of the success of their evaluation and response is quoted in terms of Victory Points and Differential.<br>
