You can get that card you need, grab a gift for a friend, or maybe just develop a gaming relationship outside your meta. IT can also help players/collectors who lack a neccessary gaming scene to finish off those collections/decks. But trading can be risky, and stressful, and these suggestions might just help to ease your mind.<br>
<br>
*********Pre-Trade**********<br>
1) Post Haves/Wants in an EASY TO READ format. Try to break your cards up by type, and set if possible. This will make it much easier for people to find cards they are looking for.<br>
<br>
2) Don't come off as @#$%y. Opening your have/want list with sayings like &quot;Will only trade for...&quot; and &quot;You must send first...&quot; is almost like a cold shower, it will turn off the traders. Post a greeting (even if smiling through gritted teeth) in a joyous manner, and in it with a thanks. You will get a much better response.<br>
<br>
3) Join the Club. Their are many organizations out there that can influence how many offers you get, AND the quality of traders you will find. (isb.dreamhost.com, www.gabtraders.com, etc.) This is like free advertising.<br>
<br>
*********Trade itiation:**********<br>
4) If you see a card you like, form an email. Ask the person (again, nicely) if they would be intested in trading it, and offer them a trade. If they deny you, ask if they would like to form their own.<br>
<br>
5) If offered a trade, respond quickly, and politely. When you recieve an offer-email, try to get back to them soon so that they will not lose interest. Keep tabs on deals you think are going well, and politely try to end the others.<br>
<br>
6) In both cases, be sure to ask for references to insure that the trader is legitament.<br>
<br>
********The Trade:***********<br>
7) Be sure and send on the date you and your protege` agreed upon... you can tell by the postmarks. Send all cards well protected, and if you are the least bit suspicious... registered. This will not only benefit your trade, but yourself as well.<br>
<br>
8) Keep records of the trade: where they were sent, on what date, to whom, their email address, etc.<br>
<br>
*********Post Trade:************<br>
9) Be sure and let your fellow trader know that you recieved the cards and their condition, and THANK THEM! Politeness is still key...even after the transaction is over. ASK them if you can use them as a reference, most will be happy to oblige.<br>
<br>
*********Trading Gone Sour:************<br>
<br>
 No matter how cautious, there always exists the risk that you may be ripped off. If you have used preventative measures (such as send a registered letter as mentioned above), retrieving your stolen merchandise should be easy. But remember, give them plenty of time, false accusation can hurt:<br>
<br>
1) Email the trader several times (do not mail bomb or spam), and ask politely if he/she has sent. If they respond, it will usually be in the form of &quot;Your cards must have gotten lost in the mail.&quot; In such a case, ask that they return your cards to you, and the trade will be settled. If they do not respond, take the next step.<br>
<br>
2) Letter to Parents. I know, sounds evil. I'm almost ready to attend college, and I live with my parents. If they ever got any report on me from another trader, I'd probably laugh. But what you must understand is that many rip-off artists (in this game at least) tend to be between the ages of 10-15. A letter to their parents explaining the predicament will often solve the situation VERY quickly.<br>
<br>
3) Registered letter of intent to file Mail Fraud charges. This is serious. Keep your cool, and let them know, again by registered letter, that you are willing to take the next step. This is the last step I can help you on, the rest is between you and the government.<br>
<br>
*******THE BOTTOM LINE********<br>
<br>
Keep the game fun. Try to be polite in all your activities, it will keep things running smooth. May your trading be successful.<br>
