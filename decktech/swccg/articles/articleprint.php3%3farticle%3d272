<br>
Card advantage is simple to define.  Every card you draw has the potential to have a positive effect on the game.  The more cards you draw, the more cards you have that can give you an advantage.  So logically, you would want to draw as many cards as possible.  The best way to get cards into your hand is by activating as much as possible.  But there are negative impacts of activation and drawing cards.<br>
<br>
-The most obvious impact of drawing cards is that every card you draw takes 1 card out of your life force.  This is rather easily negated by Traffic Control, but each card you put back is similar to using one force for no effect.  That card would be more useful in your force pile than reserve deck.<br>
Cards that operate on this principle:Traffic Control, Yoda Stew, Hydroponics Station(in combo with Trafic Control), Descent Into the dark(makes used cards become imeadiety useful)<br>
<br>
-The easiest way to outactivate your opponent is to play locations that give you more force than your opponent.  Locations have drawbacks however.  They are destiny 0, they take a card out of your hand that could be Traffic Controlled, and they have the potential to give your opponent a site to drain at.  Destiny 0's are crippling to your deck because if you draw a 0 as your only battle destiny, you will not inflict any attrition losses on your opponent.  If you have cards that get locations into play(or help you activate more), you will have an advantage in your overall destiny as you will draw fewer 0's<br>
Cards that operate on this principle: How Did We Get Into This Mess? many objectives (esp MWYHL for Dagobah sites, Yoda, and DoS), Security Precautions(not just anti HB), Tosche Station(drastically increases your activation if you can control it), Revolution, lots of other cards.<br>
<br>
-The cards that win you games(threats) cost force as well as many of the cards that stop threats.  If you simply draw up your force pile, you have a lot of threats, but no force to deploy them with.	You need to find a balance between drawing cards and paying for cards.<br>
Cards that operate on this principle: Goo Nee Tay, Bad Feeling Have I, Obi's hut, Jabba the Hutt or Master Luke in a Tatooine based deck, push cards, A Day Long Remembered (deploy 10 X-Wings really hinder your card drawing ability), SECRET PLANS &amp; BATTLE ORDER.<br>
<br>
If you want the reason almost every DS deck has Battle Order and Secret Plans, it's becasue of force advantage.  Force Draining and retrieval are at the core of winning and losing as they directly alter the life force.  These effects change the game as they disrput the flow of the activation cycle.  Push Cards also hinder your opponent's ability to play interupts in addition to stopping abusive interupts.<br>
<br>
Many top level cards do not directly impact the game but they are catalysts for the big power cards to be more effective.  Vader in your reserve deck is no good.  You need to disrput your opponents activation flow and you need to get into a good activation flow yourself(hopefully a larger cycle than your opponents).  If you outactivate your opponent by just a few force, your opponent has to deploy 2-2 imperials up against your mains if they want to compete card drawing wise.  When you deploy, you want to get the biggest card for your force.  Cards like insurrection help you get bigger forfeit cards than you would normally get for the force you pay.  There are no forfeit 8 cards for 2 force, but with Insurrection, Wedge becomes one.  Flipping the operative objective makes operatives ultra efficent.  In this way, combos help your deck drastically.  A deck with many individually efficent cards will generally lose to a more efficent deck with a combo to make their cards better than they normally are.<br>
<br>
If you are forced to react to an opponent's play, and you don't have the ample resources to react, you are at a serious disadvantage.  For example, your opponent is using IAO and ISB ops to deploy 4 different characters to 4 different sites.  Now they have more efficent characters that add to their force drains and subtract form yours.  Now you are forced to stop the opponent threats or you will lose.	If you are only activating 6-8 force a turn, you can only stop one drain and the other 3 large drains will get through.  If you can activate more than 10 force a turn, you can still stop the one drain and draw to stop more drains (or a Battle plan) on a future turn.  You could even beatdown with a Han/Chewie combo and force the opponent to Ghhk.  For the ISB player, Ghhk is a great card because it allows them to play one cheap character at a site and draw so they can get more characters to reclaim the site or move onto other sites to drain and leave the LS characters stranded.  Ghhk saves the ISB player a huge amount of used force.  This example shows that speed is important.  Tunnel Vision and HDWGITM are great cards becasue they give you access to a variety of cards faster than you would normally be able to.  Early in the game, these cards can help get locations into play faster(increasing your activation ability) or later in the game they can help to get the card you need.	In fact, it is possible to deploy every location in your deck through multiple HDWGITM.  Cards that allow you to deploy locations from your reserve deck are also important in estabishing a speed advantage.  MWYHL allows you to gain a +3 force advantage (Yoda at his Hut) without losing cards from your hand.  You can gain more force advantage with DoS and other Dagobah sites on later turns, making MWYHL a very good objective activation wise.  Careful planning is also a good card as it allows you to gain an additional location(s) to begin the game.  The accelerated start is the key to the Tosche Mains or the Throne Room Revolver deck.  Whoever activates more force at the beginning of the game dictates the pace of the game.  Cards like Goo Nee Tay and HDWGITM are the most effective at the beginning of the game.  Most top decks now have a good acceleration engine or the ability to overcome it's speed deficency (like Big Blue).<br>
<br>
When you build a deck, keep in mind what kind of activation you need to effectively deploy cards and replenish your hand.  And never draw over 12 cards unless you've verified that your opponent isn't packing GrimNok.  A used GrimNok will destroy your hard earned card drawing advantage and lost it can destroy your abusive cards.  Good Luck </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
