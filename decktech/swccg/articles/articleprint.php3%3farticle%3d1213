Hidden BAse, Profit, and occasionally MWYHL are the only objectives that see serious play, and Throne Room or Obi's Hut with Careful planning are popular, but nothing else really sees action in tournaments.  This is bad, especially when many of the decks have alot in common.  A DS player can easily build a deck to combat these 5 decks and nothing else and they could easily go 3-0 with the DS simply because everyone is playing one of 4 or 5 strategies.  The reason, the others simply aren't effective and don't match the DS options for efficent starts and decks.  However, one LS objective has been sorely overlooked and it brings with it a unique style that forces the DS to play a different game.<br>
<br>
It's Quiet Mining Colony (QMC), often called the worst LS objective.  The reason, people tried to do the wrong thing with it and none of the QMC text stands out as amazing.  With the release of ECC, people tried making GAs Miners decks (Decipher's intention) with Beldon's Eye.  This was bad because you can't drain for a bunch until QMC is flipped and it's difficult to control 2 CC sites and B:CC with GAs Miners and Z-95's.  So people threw QMC into their binder.  These same people started glowing at Profit.	Free Massa Luke, retrieve 10 force, and direct damage.	Certainly more appealing than QMC.  We'll compare them than.  For both decks, I'll assume that we're using a mains deck as a template and then I'll discuss cards that go well with either deck.<br>
<br>
Starting locations- Both get 2 2-1 sites, but QMC gets the Bespin system and the Guest Quarters (best site for mains decks), ideal for setting up Battle Plan.	Profit gets T:JP and the AC, ideal for converting with combat Readiness for T:JP and to pull the AC on the first turn, leaving Profit with no sites of their own.  T:JP is an exterior site, so vulnerable to walkers, but it can also be used for Fallen Portal.  Advantage- QMC +1<br>
<br>
Flipping conditions- this is what turns people away from QMC, it's difficult to flip while Profit is easy, jsut free Han.  Flipping QMC is more difficult to flip than ROps and QMC is easier to flip back than ROps, just control the Bepin system.  However, Profit is even easier to flip back than QMC, jsut kill Han.  Sure, Profit can use Ben Kenobi, Narrow Escape, Bacta Tank and other tricks, but QMC can easily fight ships off of Bespin with a Super Falcon.  Advantage- Profit +3<br>
<br>
Flipping help- Profit gets the free deployment of Massa Luke and cheap droids, which has huge potential for a quick beatdown on tbe 2 aliens the DS gets to start with.  Fearing beatdown, many DS decks elect not to deploy aliens at the beginning and just concede the flip. so Profit is helped in the fear department as well as the efficency department by the reduced deploy costs.  Additionally, the DS can't drain at the AC, so all DS characters can do at the AC is guard Han and wait for the beatdown. QMC gets to pull cloud sectors and Cloud city sites every turn, which allow QMC to elimiate destiny 0 locations and pull all the sites it wants.  QMC can quickly setup CC Celebration because of the ability to pull CC sites.  Someone who loves you makes flipping Profit mauch easier, Lando/Lobot makes flipping QMC much easier.	While Profit is quicker, QMC is more efficent and consistent.  No advantage.<br>
<br>
Penalties for not flipping- Profit can't do jack for force loss/retrieval very easily, they are forced to battle until they free Han.	QMC can still celebrate and drain for 1.  If the DS has to pay for their drains and QMC doesn't, The drain for 1 from 2-4 locations and celebration can keep QMC inflicting more damage.  Advantage- QMC +2<br>
<br>
Playing on the flip side-  Profit gets 5 or 10 force immeadietly and some direct damage every turn based on the number of Tatooine sites that Profit's mains occupy.  QMC should be able to celebrate and use Pucimir Thryss to enhance already decent CC drains.  Profit can use the Cantina shuffle to inflict more damage but QMC can deal more damage(with retrieval)  STill, Profit has less to protect than QMC.  Advnatage Profit +1<br>
<br>
Inherent defense strategies-  both decks have something that have to protect to keep their strategy intact.  Profit has to protect Han.  This can be done with FAllen Portal at certain sites, Ben Kenobi, Bacta Tank, REbel Barrier, and Narrow Escape.  QMC has to protect the Bespin system, which is best done by the Super Falcon, which is easily reinforced by Spiral, Redemption, and ECC Z-95's.  On the ground, all of the sites should be interior mobile sites, which means in addition to Bacta Tank, Narrow Escape, and Barrier, QMC is safe form walkers(han is trapped in the AC if he doesn't want to get trampled), Path of Least resistance (amazing card), and Lift Tube and Lift Tube escape.  Also, QMC has SOS while Profit has Massa Luke.  The ability to pull a lightsaber form reserve shouldn't be underestimated, especially when your characters don't die very easily.  If you want to, a weather vane strategy can also be used (anti-duel tech with Into the Ventilation Shaft, Lefty) to further protect characters.  Simply put, the QMC player will rarely lose battles on CC.	The Super Falcon can be Lat. Damgaged as long as it has forfeit backup.  Once QMC gets rolling, it will very rarely lose a drain race and winning battles is next to impossible.  Profit has to be on the constant look-out form Han hunters.  Many resources must be devoted to keeping Han alive, but Profit can't do jack unless it's flipped.  Advantage- QMC +3<br>
<br>
<br>
Total score- QMC +2 (I think I counted right)<br>
<br>
I failed to mention many other things that could be compared like starting interupts (esp. Dont Tread On me) and support cards.  However, each deck is individual and both objectives dont' require 60 cards to use the objective correctly.  Many cards could be added that suit individual flavor (Like Run, Luke, Run or Weapon Levitation) but I think anyone that plays either objective can find cards that they like that aren't related to the objective itself.  This article is completely biased because I'm trying to prove a point.  I like QMC and I used facts to try and prove my point.  Don't rate this article based on your opinions of either objective. I hope you give QMC a second look, only this time, don't think Gas Miners, think Pucimr Thryss and Path of Least Resistance. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
