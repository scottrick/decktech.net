<br>
Our great game&#146;s future...many articles have talked about it.  What is in store?  There are the (supposed) sure things.  Shadows with Xizor and his cronies.  Skywalkers, with the force manipulators, portrayed as our the jedi we know and love.  There will be Scoundrels, with the Scum of the Galaxy.  What will happen after that though, what will the long term future be, and how might the two sides compare?<br>
<br>
As we all know, Big D &quot;tries&quot; to make the two sides equal for competitive play and exciting games that will portray the light and the dark.  I think they have done a decent job of this and I commend them for their effort.  We all know, though, that unfortunately they have failed in some respects.  It could be in the Starwars &quot;feel&quot; like with the expansion Dagabah, or it might be in balance.  I certainly feel the Dark Side got a better shake in Endor.  Just compare, AT-ST&#146;s to ewoks...what would you rather have?  I know my answer, and it&#146;s not the teddy bears.<br>
<br>
Getting to the point though, what will future sets contain and how will they match up?	Some hoped for sets could, and I think should, be based on the books.  Examples are the Zahn Trilogy (and the Spector volumes), Anderson&#146;s jedi Trilogy with Daala and the Jedi Trainees, Children of The Jedi/Darksaber (the prior two fit together) or the Rouge Squadron books by Michael A. Stackpole.  I think out of the multitude of books, these are the top three series&#146; and authors.  As such, I will try and go in depth to describe what each set might include and how the two sides would stack up.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this first article I will detail The &quot;Rouge Squadron&quot; series by Michael A. Stackpole<br>
Depending of the response, I will go into the Zahn and Anderson Trilogies.<br>
<br>
The Cards<br>
First of all the power cards, Vehicles, Characters, and Starships.<br>
<br>
Light<br>
Characters:<br>
The trilogy focuses on Wedge&#146;s struggle to rebuild the famed Unit ROUGE SQUADRON and his trials to defeat Ysanne Isard. (Imperial Director of Intelligence, leader of the Empire)	For you book readers out there, I&#146;m only doing the first 4 books, not the rest.<br>
<br>
Of course, we must include the new Rouges, most of them if not all.  Some worthy choices might include:<br>
<br>
A new Wedge<br>
A new Tycho<br>
Corran Horn (Corellia, Lt.)<br>
Aril Nunb (Sullust, Nien&#146;s sister, Capt.)<br>
Ooryl Qrygg (Gand, Corran&#146;s wingman)<br>
Gavin Darklighter (Tatoonie)<br>
Asyr Sei&#146;lar (Bothan)<br>
Nawara Ven (Twi&#146;lek)<br>
Inyri Forge (Kesselite)<br>
<br>
Winter (Alderaan, Friend to Leia)<br>
Whistler (Corran&#146;s astromech)<br>
Mynock (Wedge&#146;s astromech)<br>
Mirax Terrik (Corran&#146;s wife to be)<br>
Vartix (Non-unique Bacta Producing Labor Workers)<br>
New Republic officals and/or senators<br>
<br>
With the exception of the last five, all are pilots in the Squadron.  To picture them, think back to the Red squadron pilots from Premiere onward.  These pilots would have similar capibilities in their X-WINGS.  Some strengths that could conceivably be added would be Bonuses with Wingmen.<br>
Corran With Ooyrl, Wedge With Tycho Etc.  While this has already been covered a little bit, it could be extended to something like a Zuckuss in ship ability or Bonus Immunity to attriton.  For Heavy Hitters (mains) there isn&#146;t a whole lot to chose from.  Mirax and Winter might qualify, along with some others:<br>
<br>
Gen. Airen Cracken (promoted)<br>
New Ackbar<br>
Pash Cracken (Son of Airen)<br>
Gen. Salm (y-wing wing commander, promoted)<br>
Booster Terrik (Smuggler, Mirax&#146;s Father)<br>
Iella Wessiri (New Republic Intelligence)<br>
<br>
Understand, these books purposely shy away from the familiar Mains, such as Luke, Han, and Leia.  They are meant to portray the &quot;Working Man&#146;s Hero&quot;<br>
<br>
Dark:<br>
Ysanne Isard<br>
Fliry Vorru (Former Moff, Black Sun Members)<br>
Zekka Thyne (Underling of Vorru)<br>
Other Black Sun Associates<br>
Erisi Dlart (Traitor of Rouge Squadron)<br>
Non Uniques, pilots and the like<br>
<br>
The Dark Side doesn&#146;t have as much to choose from, the focus being on the light in the books.  It does pack some punch with the first four characters menitoned, but in this area, the LS has the advantage.  The Non-uniques could be tie interceptor pilots.  Instead of &quot;Imperial Pilot, there could be &quot;Interceptor pilot.&quot;  Since only elite members of the squadron corps fly interceptors, they might add 1 to manuver along with 2 to power or three to power.<br>
<br>
Ships:<br>
Like Death Star II, the Light side would gain lots of ships.  First would be:<br>
Another Chance (an Alderaan War Frigate, undiscovered by Empire)<br>
The New Rouge Squadron X-wings<br>
Perhaps more Mon Cals<br>
More new starfighters with more Unique A-wings and B-wings, such as Nova: B, and Polearm: A-wings)<br>
Pulsar Skate (Mirax&#146;s ship for smuggling)<br>
<br>
Dark:<br>
Dark would get another Super class, that being Lusankya, Isard&#146;s flagship<br>
A new Victory class, Corrupter<br>
New Imperial Class Star Destroyers, such as the Virulence<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides any more unique ties, that would be it.  As I said, the focus is not of the dark side in the books.<br>
I think the dark would have an edge in this matchup, as it had the sheer power advantage, Wedge won by skill and cunning.  If the two or more of the four destroyers teamed up, they might receive such things as power bonuses or immunity to greater amounts of attrition.<br>
<br>
Vehicles<br>
This is really a non-issue, as there were no vehicles thoughout the series.  The focus was turned upward in the space battlefield.<br>
<br>
Effects/Interrupts<br>
In the next sections I&#146;ll be very generalized.  I will cover the main concepts and ideas, but not get much into specifics.<br>
<br>
Light:<br>
There will be the obivious ones, such as<br>
<br>
Rouge Squadron Helpers<br>
Teamwork cards<br>
Possibly some new AO&#146;s<br>
Intelligence (Wessiri, Madine, Page)<br>
<br>
And there will be the not so obivious<br>
<br>
Bacta effects, strategies.  Comes from the books.<br>
More Courscant effects for light, and possibly some sites to go with.<br>
Cards bases around a new government.  For instance:<br>
If you have Mon Mothma, and admiral, a general, and a commander on the table, add two battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Weapons<br>
There will likely be nothing new in this era, as no new technologies have been developed.<br>
<br>
Purple Cards<br>
There are some definate possibilites with this catagory, mostly with the objectivies.  Again, these are just general ideas.<br>
<br>
Light: A light side Courscant objective that focuses on setting up the government.<br>
<br>
(0) A New Era, The New Republic<br>
<br>
      While this side up, once per turn you may take one<br>
      Mon Mothma, Madine, or Senator  from reserve<br>
      deck into hand.  May also take a courscant site.<br>
      Opponents deploy +2 to Courscant Sites, Dark<br>
      jedi may not deploy to Coruscant.   Flip when you<br>
      control three or more Courscant Sites and opponent<br>
      controls no Courscant Sites.  Place out of play if<br>
      Courscant &quot;Blown Away.&quot;<br>
<br>
(7)  A Reign of Peace<br>
<br>
      While this side up, your force drains are +1 at<br>
      Courscant locations.  Opponents attrition against you<br>
      is -3.  While Mon Mothma at a Courscant Location<br>
      your total power is +5, and weapons may be fired<br>
      twice per battle.   Flip if Mon Mothma not at a<br>
      Courscant Location, or if opponent controls two<br>
      Courscant locations with two imperials at each.<br>
      Place out of play if Courscant &quot;Blown Away.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dark:  Focuses on reclaiming the upper hand, and the galaxy.<br>
<br>
(0)  Take Back the Galaxy<br>
<br>
While this side up, you may not deploy Vader or the<br>
Emperor.  Royal Guards, Moffs, Admirals and Isard may deploy from your reserve deck, once per turn.  Once per turn, may also take one Coruscant location into hand.  You may take one star destroyer into hand. (Once while this side up)  Your power in battles is +5 and and your spies deploy for free.  Flip this card if Imperials, including Isard, control two Courscant Sites.<br>
<br>
(7)  A Reign of Terror<br>
<br>
While this side up, may deploy Vader and Palpatine from reserve deck and/or hand.  May take Epic duel into hand. (Once per game)  Opponents Jedi are forfiet -2.  When<br>
firing a lightsaber add two to total destiny.  Blasters may<br>
fire repeatedly, and when all the ability on table is provided by Imperials, opponents forcedrains are -1 and your power/ battle destiny +3.  Flip if two of opponents jedi are on Coruscant.  Place out of play if you do not control any Courscant sites or Isard not on table.<br>
<br>
The objectives are meant to focus on battling (the dark more than the light) I haven&#146;t playtested these, but I think they would make for a competitive game.  For locations, let your mind make them up.  There isn&#146;t a limit on the imagination!  You might want to try the Palace, the Mountains, skyhooks etc.  If you play with these, let me know how it went.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, helpful reviews are welcomed.  What could I do better, etc.<br>
