This is your guide to Politics for LS, I won&#146;t be able to get the DS Counterpart up until later in August due to my vacation (Hawaii, woohoo). Anyways, I&#146;ve seperated this into several parts, the first few are all cards, the last few are deck ideas etc. My thanks go out to the Courscant Spoiler here on decktech where I got the text for all of these!<br>
<br>
I) Political Cards<br>
<br>
Section 1: The Two Big Ones<br>
<br>
Plead My Case To The Senate / Sanity And Compassion <br>
Destiny 0 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Objective [U] <br>
Side 0 Text: Deploy Galactic Senate and any other [Episode I] location. <br>
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability &lt; 4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. You may deploy cards on your Political Effects to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. <br>
Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least one with with a peace agenda) at Galactic Senate. <br>
Side 7 Text: While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponentís hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (or +3 for any character with an order agenda) when drawn for battle or weapon destiny. May use 2 Force at end of a turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. <br>
Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This is your Political Objective. It&#146;s looks to be the weakest of the 4 new objectives (even the DS one has some increadable uses such as limited resource abuse etc). However, you should notice that you can use some Rebels to get a quick boost, and use the rest of your senators to abuse the system. You should know there are only 9 actual political people (and only FIVE(5), yes count them FIVE senators, plus Amadalia who can be used as one only on Politcal Effects, and the The Supreme Chancellor (SCV) and  Friends). You need a Peace agenda senator for a quick flip, which shouldn&#146;t be a problem considering 4 of 5 of the Senators have it (Yarua, our wookiee friend doesn&#146;t). Good things on this include cancelling Counter/Surprise Assaults, You can actually deploy characters from the political effects to table, and weapon destinies are -6 at the senate chamber.<br>
<br>
*Coruscant: Galactic Senate <br>
LIGHT SIDE Site Location [C] <br>
Dark Force Icons: 1 Light Force Icons: 1 <br>
DS Text: During battles here, a character&#146;s power is equal to that character&amp;#8217;s politics. <br>
LS Text: During battles here, a character&#146;s power is equal to that character&amp;#8217;s politics. <br>
Planet Location <br>
Interior Site <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This is the site. It&#146;s not a Batttleground (read the FKA CRD AKA STG), it makes power pretty useless, and as the little thing on Decipher says, Darth Maul only draws destiny and is power 0. Your gonna wanna beef up the Senate with as many politicans as you can to keep beating them down in here. <br>
<br>
Section 2: The Interrupts<br>
<br>
*Baseless Accusations <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Lost Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: The first step in removing a political opponent is to bring their reputation into question. <br>
Text: During any control phase, target an opponent&#146;s senator present with your character with politics at Galactic Senate. For remainder of turn, target&#146;s game text is canceled and target is politics = 0. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Your average common card. It would be broken if it wasn&#146;t lost. It&#146;s kinda like a power pivot for senators, and can make for a fun little beatdown if you set it up right by doing it durring your control phase, setting up a good destiny draw and taking out a politics 3 or 4 character.<br>
<br>
*Might Of The Republic <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Used Interrupt [R] <br>
Lore: Despite its current reputation, the Republic still has able citizens that are willing to try and fight the injustices before them. <br>
Text: Once per game, retrieve 1 Force for each of your senators at Galactic Senate. (Immune to Sense.) OR Take one senator (or Coruscant Guard, Sei Taria or Mas Amedda) into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Abyssian Ornament and Jabba&#146;s Twerps rolled into one as Destiny 5. I woulda died for this with my MKOS deck of long ago. You should pack at least 2 copies of this baby in your deck because it WILL be grabbed. And your going to want to have that last one ready to retrieve near the end of the game. Remember, you only have 5 senators so be sure you have them all out<br>
<br>
*New Leadership Is Needed <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Used Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: The political process in the Republic is one whereby even the most powerful positions are fraught with peril. <br>
Text: If you have a senate majority, activate 1 Force. OR If your opponent has a senate majority, place your character with politics at Galactic Senate in Used Pile to place an opponent&#146;s character present (your choice) in opponentís Used Pile. (Immune to Sense.) <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This card is pretty tech if you have a politics deck and are losing. If you are winning, with Watto&#146;s new obj going to be so prominent, it&#146;s a must have to be able to draw up one extra card then activate one force to call their bluff. Also, a sortof backward overwhelemed allowed you to throw down some scrub rebel leader and take out their big destiny guy.<br>
<br>
*Stay Here, Where It&#146;s Safe <br>
Destiny 4 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Used Interrupt [C] <br>
Lore: Having enforced a momentous change upon the Senate, the headstrong Queen then wished to return to Naboo and do the same. <br>
Text: Target your character with a peace or order agenda. Draw destiny. For remainder of turn, target is power + X (or politics +X if at Galactic Senate) and immune to attrition &lt; X, where X = destiny number of the card drawn. (Immune to Sense.) <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
All of your senators will have either peace or agenda, fair enough. With a well tracked 7 a weak senator could take out the rest of the senate by himself.<br>
<br>
*Vote Now! <br>
Destiny 5 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Used Interrupt [R] <br>
Lore: &quot;Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!&quot; <br>
Text: During your control phase, draw destiny. If destiny &gt; 2, draw up to X cards (maximum 4) from Reserve Deck, where X = your total politics at Galactic Senate minus opponent&amp;#8217;s total politics at Galactic Senate. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This is a good card to use in congunction with naked C-3P0 because it will probably either give you an extra double that could be monnocked or another card that isn&#146;t usefull at the time. Just be sure to have 4 politics greater than your opponent when you play this.<br>
<br>
Section 3: The Political Effects<br>
<br>
All of the following work very similar to Den Of Thieves (and several other cards like it), Except for the fact that you may only have 1 senator on the card at a time, and there is no way to get them off without flipping your objective. While you have a correct match with agendas you get a long term bonus.<br>
<br>
*Ascertaining The Truth <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: &quot;We must move quickly to stop the Trade Federation.&quot; <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to subtract 3 from any battle destiny just drawn. If an order agenda here, during your move phase you may peek at top 2 cards of any Reserve Deck; replace in any order. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Ascertaining the Truth is definatly not the best of the 4 Effects, it subtracts 3 from a destiny which could be good if you need to save Home 1, or perhaps a Jedi. Its look a 2 top cards may be usefull with Mirax + C3P0. Order agendas are pretty common between the senators, so its not that hard to get someone onto it.<br>
<br>
*The Gravest Of Circumstances <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: &quot;The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade Federation.&quot; <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to add 3 to a battle destiny just drawn. If a taxation agenda here, during your turn may place any one card from hand on Used Pile; opponent must use 1 Force or lose 1 Force. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Well the opposite of Ascertaining basically, add 3 instead. Yea ok, maybe. Gotta take out someone? this is the card to do it with. Taxation agenda isn&#146;t as common in the light side,(only Hor and Wookie) sooo this could be a problem. But, its benifit is 10x better than our first effect. Watto&#146;s Revenge I call it, you show that Watto&#146;s objective that you can play nasty too with your own effect. It keeps them on their toes and with a Beggar or Treva heh heh heh.<br>
<br>
*I Will Not Defer <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: &quot;I&#146;ve come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.&quot; <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to add 2 to your next Force drain at a battleground this turn. If a peace agenda here, once per turn you may activate up to 2 Force when opponent initiates battle. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Hurray, add 2 to a force drain is nice. Draw 2 when you battle, that&#146;s ok I guess, I&#146;d rather get another destiny or something, isn&#146;t there already another ls card that does that?<br>
<br>
*Plea To The Court <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Political Effect [U] <br>
Lore: Amidala did not hold much hope in the options she had. Regardless of how limited the choices, she had to choose one path to try and avert disaster befalling Naboo. <br>
Text: Deploy on table. If no senator here, you may place a senator here from hand to cancel an opponent&amp;#8217;s Force drain. If a justice agenda here, during a battle where opponent has a weapon and you do not, may cancel a just drawn weapon destiny to cause a re-draw. <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Force drain canceller, a Den of Theives finally. It&#146;s second game text, well it&#146;s not that usefull, unless you have to save some unarmed jedi or perhaps a wild saber in the senate. Justice isn&#146;t a popular agenda with most of the senators, which makes it somewhat tough to pull off.<br>
<br>
Section 4: Non-Senator Characters<br>
<br>
All of the following characters have politics (Excluding the Guards), but are not Senators, meaning they can not flip your objective by being at the senate, and cannot (with the exception of the Queen), be placed on Political Effects. They do however, have some great advantages that make them worthwhile to play.<br>
<br>
Coruscant Guard <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Highly trained guard personnel play a valuable role in protecting the various dignitaries and political figures that frequently have business to attend to on Coruscant. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 1 <br>
Text: Once per turn, may use 1 Force to add 2 to politics of one of your senators present for remainder of turn. While present at Galactic Senate, all characters without politics here are forfeit = 0 (except Coruscant Guards). <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Warrior <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The Courscant Guard is like the secret service, you walk into the senate without being a politican and they&#146;ll shoot ya. They don&#146;t have any politics mind you, so they are power 0 in Senate battles, however they can use 1 force to add 2 (there power) to another character&#146;s politics which is a pretty even tradeoff. Also, they have the nice ability to make anyone whose not a Politican forfiet = 0, keeping random scrubs out. Deploy 2 Forfiet 4 is average, and ability 1 is alright because they don&#146;t need to be smart.<br>
<br>
*Queen Amidala, Ruler Of Naboo <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: Naboo leader. Frustrated by the Trade Federation&#146;s control of her planet, Amidala came to the Senate to plead her case in person. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 4 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: justice, peace. While in a senate majority, once during your control phase, may retrieve 1 Force for each Naboo site you control. May be placed on your Political Effect instead of a senator. Immune to attrition &lt; 3. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 6 <br>
Warrior <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Ahh The Queen. She&#146;s only Politics 2 which is a dissapointment (but she can go up), She has her little Justice and Peace Agendas, so she can go on I Will Not Defer and Plea to the Court. She&#146;s also a strong Ability 4 and has a small immunity to attrition. She deploys for 3, but is not a senator so she can&#146;t help you flip your objective. A deck with Naboo in it would want her at the Senate as she is the equivalent of a &quot;Naboo Celebration&quot; while in majority.<br>
<br>
*Supreme Chancellor Valorum <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: Although Finis Valorum maintains the Galactic Senate&amp;#8217;s ultimate title, his real power is mired by endless bureaucracy, petty corruption, and incessant plotting. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 4 Politics 5: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, justice, order. While in a senate majority, once per turn may use 1 Force to cancel a battle destiny just drawn at another site. Opponent may use X Force; Valorum is politics -X for remainder of turn. <br>
DEPLOY: 4 FORFEIT: 7 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Valorum is an amazing Politics 5 giving him the edge over the competition, but at a price. He has the ability to be de-politicized by your opponent every turn for the use of force. This makes him very suseptable to a beatdown if left alone, so don&#146;t. While in a majority he has the nice game text of being able to cancel a battle destiny anywhere. He deploys for 4 which isn&#146;t bad and neither is a forfiet of 7. His ability of 4 also allows him to draw destiny even if he is alone, which could be a lifesaver along with some of the politcal effects.<br>
<br>
*Mas Amedda <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Chancellor&#146;s Chagrian advisor who maintains order in the Senate. Although Senator Palpatine suggested he may be on the Trade Federationís payroll, nothing has been proven yet. <br>
POWER: 3 ABILITY: 2 Politics 3: <br>
Text: Agenda: order. If with Valorum, your Force generation at this location is +1. While in a senate majority, once during your control phase, if you occupy a battleground site and a battleground system, opponent loses 2 Force. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The Emperor has Janus and Sim, Valorum has Mas and Sei. This guy is not a senator, but adds 1 to your activation when with the supreme chancellor (which makes the senate effectivaly a 2/1 site) He has a nice game text which requires you to hold a site and a system but has a very rewarding 2 force loss a turn while in a majority. He will be a target for the opponents, expecially with his politics 3, deploy 2 and forfiet 5.<br>
<br>
*Sei Taria <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Valorum&#146;s female administrative aide who has studied the taxation bills. After Valorum was voted out of his position as Chancellor, Sei chose to leave political life. <br>
POWER: 2 ABILITY: 2 Politics 3: <br>
Text: Agendas: peace, taxation. If with Valorum, your Force generation at this location is +1. While in a senate majority, your Force drains are +1 at battleground systems while you control a battleground site. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
The second guy, which could make the senate a 3/1 site if both of them are with Valorum. Another helpful system/site combo that ups your force drains, which could make a system like Kessel a deadly trap. Of course make sure Imperial Decree isn&#146;t set up or else this guy isn&#146;t too usefull with a deploy of 3 and not being a senator.<br>
<br>
Section 5: The Senators<br>
<br>
Each of the follow 5 characters are the light side senators that will help you flip the objective, they all have intresting game texts that can be utilized in different ways.<br>
<br>
*Horox Ryyder <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [C] <br>
Lore: Anx senator. Known for his patience, Horox exhibits unique insight into many complicated Senate issues. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: order, taxation, peace. While in a senate majority, opponent may not draw more than one battle destiny at battleground systems, and you may not cancel opponent&amp;#8217;s battle destiny draws at systems. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Horox isn&#146;t my favorite senator, he only has ability 2 and politics 2, He gives you a very large advantage by limiting destinies a battleground systems. He&#146;s got Order, Taxation and Peace so you may want to just circulate him through your deck with the political effects due to his weak politics/ability.<br>
<br>
*Liana Merian <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Alderaanian senator. Known for her efforts to promote peace throughout the Republic by using her homeworld as an example. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 3 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: peace, trade. While in a senate majority, once during opponent&#146;s turn, target an opponent&#146;s just drawn battle destiny; opponent must use or lose 2 Force or that battle destiny = 0. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
Does everyone from Alderaan look like Leia? She&#146;s about 5x better than Horox, she deploys for 2 with a nice forfiet of 5 and has politics 2 and ability 3. Her game text is very nice when the opponent battles you at a site, they may lose 2 force to keep the destiny and then you can cancel it with Valorum or perhaps they won&#146;t lose force and you could cancel one with Valorum too? Peace and Trade help to flip your objective quickly and I&#146;d probably pack two copies of her if I were you.<br>
<br>
*Senator Palpatine <br>
Destiny 3 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [R] <br>
Lore: Senator for the Naboo. Advised Amidala on actions required to highlight their conflict with the Trade Federation. Watches young Skywalker&#146;s future with great interest. <br>
POWER: 1 ABILITY: 4 Politics 4: <br>
Text: Agendas: ambition, peace, order. While in a senate majority, once per turn, if opponent just drew battle destiny, use 1 Force to add its destiny number to your total power in that battle (you may not cancel that draw). Amidala is politics +1 here. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 5 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
If one more person asks if you can deploy him with Emperor on the table I&#146;m going to kill them. Well, maybe not. Ability 4, Politics 4, deploy for 3. His game text lets you basically take away the power adding ability of destiny draws, it stops Valorum, but he also adds 1 to the politics of Amidala (making her politcs 3, much better). He&#146;s not very powerfull outside the senate, but neither are the others. He seeks peace order and ambition which allow for a quick flip and use of 2 the political effects, but then again, would you expect any less from Palpy?<br>

*Tendau Bendon <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Ithorian senator. Called on by his people to represent them in the Senate, even though his heart is not in politics. Voted against the taxation of trade routes. <br>
POWER: 3 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: justice, peace. While in a senate majority, if you have at least one card in hand, once during your control phase may place your hand in Used Pile to draw up to four cards from Reserve Deck. <br>
DEPLOY: 2 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Episode I <br>
<br>
This guy is tech. He&#146;s not that great as an ability 2 politics 2 character, but he&#146;s got Peace agenda which means quick flip, and his senate majority text is waht you want to look at. Once during your control phases you can drop your hand and draw 4 cards. How nice is that near end game? Track an on the edge and leave a 6 below and you could win a game with huge differential. What about Monnock protection? Don&#146;t want them to draw up one next turn right? He&#146;s just... Wow. Also, helpfull when your struggling with 2 or 3 cards and they all stink. Just do it.<br>
<br>
*Yarua <br>
Destiny 2 <br>
LIGHT SIDE Republic Character [U] <br>
Lore: Kashyyyk&#146;s senior Wookiee senator. Believes that a thorough taxation plan will assist funding of other worthwhile Republic programs. Despises the corruption around him. <br>
POWER: 5 ABILITY: 2 Politics 2: <br>
Text: Agendas: justice, taxation. While in a senate majority, retrieve 1 Force when you initiate a Force drain at a battleground system. Once per turn, may use 1 Force to target a senator present with a wealth agenda. Target is politics -2 this turn. <br>
DEPLOY: 3 FORFEIT: 4 <br>
Episode I<br>
<br>
One word, Wookie Strangle. Well maybe not, but he&#146;s got 7 + Destiny for that. Force drain at a system and retrieve 1 force?!? with Val&#146;s 2 friends you could be dealing them MAJOR force loss. He also shows off his strength against wealth agendas. However, he&#146;s deploy 3 for politics 2 ability 2 and he&#146;s the only senator not peacefull (give him a break, he&#146;s a wookie). He&#146;s a good choice for a beatdown in and out of the senate.<br>
<br>
This concludes the examining the cards portion, next I&#146;ll look at a few ideas, then the final cheat sheet for Politicans.<br>
<br>
II) Deck Ideas<br>
<br>
Section 6: Building A Politics Deck<br>
<br>
Be sure to read the objective over carefully before starting. Done? Ok, There are a few things you want to remember, You Want Senators with Peace Agendas to flip quickly, you want High Politics, and you want damage + retrieval. The objective also gives a flexiable start by allowing you to deploy a Ep1 location. Jedi Council??? Seems popular enough, perhaps Slave Quarters to pull Shmi? Maybe. It&#146;s up to you and how you want to design your deck. First off If you start the Jedi Council you&#146;ll be able to get 5+ Force turn 1 and deploy Yoda 1st turn to get another force. Yoda allows you to move Jedis around which could be a great idea for this deck. However it may become tedious to have a bunch of ep1 jedis and politicans and thats it. A Mains deck may fair better, perhaps playing on Naboo? Naboo alows you to use the Queen&#146;s game text to set up good retrieval, and the sites are decent there. You might want to set up Kessel too with the Sei, Mas, Yaura combo. Again, this is all up to you and what you want to do. <br>
<br>
Senate podracing seems a bit far fecthed to me. You have a bunch of low destiny Politicans, a few recycable 5s, and Anakin just isn&#146;t goin to win against Sebulba in this deck, however you could have an intresting deck if you find a way to break it. #s is basically out of the question, unless you want to not use politicans at all.<br>
<br>
So of course, you all want numbers. Well there are 9 politicans, and its difficult to say, but basically I&#146;d put in 2 of each. Plus probably 3x Might of the Republic, since it&#146;s the most powerful of the interrupts (and most likely to be grabbed), New Leadership is tech if you think DS politics will be heavy (I think you may see it now and then, but Watto&#146;s Objective seems more of a threat). Stay Here is Ok too, probably only want 1 of that though. Vote Now is a definate 2x-er. Baseless Accusations I would pack one of because I&#146;d rather have more used interrupts, but it could be abused if played correctly. Politician-wise, your going to want to play 2x each of the Senators strait up, you need them in your hand quick, and they need to be able to be circulated through the politcal effects. Valorum is a 2-er too, if you get 2 in your boxes. Queen Amidala is iffy, I&#146;d say if your going to Play Naboo play 2x of her, If not play Padme, she&#146;s more effective in pulling your friends Obi and Qui. Palpy is probably a three. You want him and you want him out fast. He&#146;s politcs and ability 4 which means he&#146;s going to hold the site in early turns. Mas and Sei are 1x each unless you can set up the battlegruond system/sites. Each Effect should be played one of. If you want to pull one, take out Ascertaning the Truth, it&#146;s got it strong points, but not as strong as the other 3.<br>
<br>
Section 7: Who Else Should Be In?<br>
<br>
Strike Planning/You&#146;ve Got Alot Of Guts Coming Here/Security Control - Pull Crix + Another General and stick them down first turn to get a quick Senate advantage. Crix can pull Blount, stopping any stupid ISB stuff still around. This Makes Crix, Solo, Gen. Cal all Forfiet +1, and all your Politicans +2 and you can pull docking bays.<br>
<br>
Mains - Simply enough, if you&#146;ve got mains, you can be an absolute menace with all the politicans powers, they can add to destinies, stop destines, subtract from destines, cause redraws, you&#146;ll never lose basically.<br>
<br>
Menace Fades - With Mas, Sei and Wookie, you&#146;ve got the following while you hold 1 battleground site and 1 battleground systems: Cancel drain bonuses, +1 drain at system, 2 force loss, retrieve 1 when you drain at the system. That&#146;s not too bad for 2 sites, with a few sticks you can drain pretty high, and set up some nice retrieval.<br>
<br>
Jedi Council - It seems to me the best place to start with or without Yoda. 3/0 sites are just good.<br>
<br>
Sense/Alter - People will be targeting your effects, so you may want to pack this or at least protection. If you pull Yoda, why not?<br>
<br>
III) The Cheat Sheet<br>
<br>
Section 8: Cheat Sheet<br>
<br>
The Following is A Cheat Sheet For Quick Reference To The Politicans in The Following Order: <br>
<br>
Name - Destiny - Agendas - Politics - Ability - Senator? - Special Abilities<br>
<br>
Horox - 3 - O, P, T - 2 - 2 - Y - Opponent Only draws 1 destiny at systems (No Cancelling at Systems)<br>
Liana - 2 - P, T - 2 - 3 - Y - 1x Per Opponent Turn, target opponent&#146;s destiny, lose 2 force or = 0<br>
Mas - 2 - O - 3 - 2 - N - +1 Force with Val, If Control BG System/Site Opponent Loses 2 force during your control phase<br>
Queen - 3 - J, P -2 - 4 - N - Retrieve 1 Force at each Naboo site you control, may deploy on Poltical effects<br>
Sei - 3 - P, T 3 - 2 - N - +1 Force With Val, Force Drain +1 at BG systems while you control a BG Site<br>
Palpy - 3 - A, P, O - 4 - 4 - Y - +1 Queen Politcs. 1 Force to add destiny # to total power<br>
Val - 3 - A, J, O - 5 - 4 - N - Opp. May Use X force to reduce poltics by X. 1 force cancel a destiny at a site<br>
Tendau - 2 - J, P - 2 - 2 - Y - While you have 1 card in hand, during control place hand in used to draw 4<br>
Yarua - 2 - J, T - 2 - 2 - Y - Retrieve 1 force when you drain at BG System. 1 force to -2 politics to a wealth agenda.<br>
