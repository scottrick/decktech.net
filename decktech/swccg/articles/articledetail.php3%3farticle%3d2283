You blink away the fatigue-induced haze and squint to see card text clearly as you tune your Watch Your Step and Hunt Down decks to perfection.  Then a terrible thought chills you from head to toe.  Didn&#146;t it say &quot;Closed Environment&quot;?  <br>
<br>
  You&#146;re getting no sleep tonight, you resigned yourself to that halfway through Empire and a 2-liter of Coke.  Now you&#146;ve got a few short hours to build winning decks.  Can it be done?  Wait, didn&#146;t you see an article about this format on Decktech earlier in the week?  <br>
<br>
  So now you&#146;re here.  Welcome back.  Let&#146;s roll up our sleeves and get to work.<br>
<br>
  The best objective for Dark Side in this format is easily Bring Him Before Me.  Taking Luke out of action gets rid of a powerful character and his pesky lightsaber, it gives you good force generation without giving it away to the opponent, and it gets the Emperor out quick.<br>
<br>
  Much has been written about this objective, so I&#146;ll try and restrict my comments to the unique aspects of this format.  Limited card access is one of the sticking points with players considering trying out this format.  Don&#146;t worry too much about it, you can make do with The Emperor from Reflections II (DSII icon, it&#146;s legal) and a copy of Leave Them To Me, not perfect, but it works.  If he&#146;s lost somehow, ditch Leave Them To Me to retrieve him and deploy him again next turn.<br>
<br>
  Lord Vader is the tricky one.  Put in as many copies as you have, up to 4, and use multiples of Captain Sarkli if you fall short.  He can turn off force generation at a 2-0 site like a switch, slowing down a There Is Good In Him deck enough for you to get way ahead in the damage race in spite of losing force until Vader is out.  <br>
<br>
  No Escape isn&#146;t available in this format, so you will be confronted by Honor Of The Jedi.  Take your time spreading out to cover three battlegrounds, though, it may be better to dig in at a couple and keep a reserve of characters and ships in hand while your opponent is losing 1 force to Your Destiny instead of 3.  <br>
<br>
  There Is Good In Him players love this card, because it zeroes out the force drain at Chief Chirpa&#146;s Hut, in theory.  In practice, you&#146;ll never be shut down this way if you have Emperor Palpatine.  He moves inside the Hut, and because of his Dark Jedi Master icon, there are now LS and DS icons at the site, it&#146;s a battleground.  Look it up, it works.  So your drain of 2 is protected.  <br>
<br>
  You&#146;ve got one site between the Emperor and his tricks, Force Lightning, Janus/Sim, all explained in the strategy section of any Bring Him deck on this site.  How to hold the rest?  The main DS ground themes are Speeder Bikes, AT-STs, and Royal Guards.  Each has its weaknesses, take my advice, mix and match.<br>
<br>
  Speeder Bikes run into a lot of resistance from Get Alongside That One, used by LS players to leave those Biker Scouts standing around looking lost, and especially Insertion Planning, which is in most LS decks in this environment.  When your biker deploys or moves around, he can get popped back to your hand.  Not good.  Free Ride also grabs Speeder Bikes from your hand or a site, also not good.<br>
<br>
  For these reasons, I don&#146;t suggest building a deck around Speeder Bikes.  A couple of the unique guys are worth using, however.  Sergeant Barich is a decent pilot who, unlike other bikers, adds his power to starships as well as to vehicles, and can even use his powerful game text in space.  If he&#146;s with another biker scout, draw a destiny, take that off the opponent&#146;s power and attrition.  Nasty.  The other one is Sergeant Elsek, who isn&#146;t such a cool pilot, but can be forfeited in a battle where you have another biker scout to just wipe out all the attrition and battle damage.<br>
<br>
  Doesn&#146;t matter if your opponent just played I Know and drew 3 Ewok Catapults for battle destiny, all you lose is Elsek.  Only works at a site, but if you occupy Carida, you can ditch a card every turn to keep getting him back and you&#146;ve just locked down the site.  Plus your opponent has to lose something to attrition each time.  These guys are best tucked away inside a walker when they&#146;re up to this dirty pool, or some scout with a blaster couple take out Barich and temporarily break the lock.  <br>
<br>
  Use some walkers, not all of them.  Tempest Scout 1 and 2 are the best of the lot.  Two pilot slots each and immunity to attrition with a matching pilot.  With two seats, they can house the Barich/Elsek combo.  Tempest 1 is your heavy hitter, Commander Igar&#146;s machine.  Imperial Command can pull Admiral Piett, he pulls Igar, and Battle Deployment pulls Tempest 1.  A great combo for one entirely downloaded from the deck.  <br>
<br>
  For additional hitting power on the ground, we&#146;ll turn to Royal Guards.  There aren&#146;t a bunch of counters to these floating around like there are for Speeder Bikes, but they still seem to be best used to complement a powerful ground force instead of as the backbone of a deck.  The basic Royal Guard deploys to the same or a related site as the Emperor, which in this format means they&#146;re not very restricted at all.  Power 3, ability 2, destiny 3, add a battle destiny when defending with a Force Pike.  <br>
<br>
  Myn Kyneugh is even better, a 4 destiny unique Royal Guard who adds a destiny whenever he&#146;s armed with a Force Pike, either defending or attacking.  Also adds to the defense value of other Royal Guards at the same site.  Use a couple copies of Myn and perhaps three or four Royal Guards, with 3 Force Pikes.  They&#146;ll give you extra flips and weapons to cut down those Light Side characters.  You get a destiny +1&gt;defense value, and your target is hit and power=0, a great way to even up the power even before you get your multiple flips.  <br>
<br>
  There are a couple sorts of Admiral&#146;s Orders.  The ones you actually use to support a space deck, and the ones you slip into a ground deck to really dominate just by holding the system overhead.  We&#146;re building a balanced deck here, let&#146;s go for a bit of both.  Don&#146;t load up on a bunch of copies of one AO, using a couple copies each of the cool ones gives the deck more flexibility and lets you recycle a 6 by converting your own AO.  <br>
<br>
  Battle Deployment is a must, limiting your opponent to one battle destiny on the ground and deploying your walkers from the deck.  Fighter Cover increases the immunity of yoru characters with immunity to attrition and adds to their weapon destiny.  That helps keep Lord Vader, Janus, and Sim alive and well.  It also makes any starfighter that fires a weapon in battle power +3, and lets you cancel a redraw your starship weapon destiny once per turn.  We will find a use for that.<br>
<br>
  Lastly, Fighters Coming In.  Hurts LS ships with no pilot characters, gives your unique TIEs with pilots extra immunity, pumps up your force drain at a docking bay.  But the tricky part is, it gives you some reusable forfeit fodder.  One per turn, relocate a starfighter you just lost to a related docking bay.  At the Endor system, this means you can forfeit the Emperor&#146;s Personal Shuttle for 5, send it to the DB, and take off again (for free) on your move phase.  Reusable forfeit fodder.  Works with unique TIEs, too, keep one unpiloted in the cargo hold of a Star Destroyer, shuttle a pilot down to fly it back up again during your move phase.<br>
<br>
  Don&#146;t give the other two AOs the time of day.  Intensify Forward Firepower is kind of cool for the Royal Guards, getting them down cheap, but either player can use the defense value -4 text, giving your opponent an easy time zapping the Executor or other Star Destroyers.  More LS Turbolasers see play in this format than DS because of all the pilots who add to weapon destiny, so this will help your opponent out more than you.  <br>
<br>
  We&#146;re In Attack Position Now is just not good.  It has the potential to deal some direct damage, and helps you get pilots down cheap on Star Destroyers.  But your opponent gets that benefit, too, and he will be dropping pilots dirt cheap.  LS has more capitals with built-in immunity in this format, too, so the text on this helps the opponent more than you by bumping the Independence up to immunity &lt;6 and Home One to absurd heights.  If you do play with it, try to convert it as soon as you&#146;re done dropping cheap pilots.<br>
<br>
  In space, the choice of Star Destroyers should be obvious.  Chimaera, Flagship Executor, Thunderflare, Judicator, and Accuser are the best.  If you want more, Victory-Class Star Destroyers from the starter deck round it out.  Then the starfighters.  Saber 1 and Baron Soontir Fel for the destiny adder, a couple more matching Saber fighters and pilots for Fel&#146;s boost to total battle destiny in case you have to make do with one flip thanks to Rebel Leadership.  <br>
<br>
  Mentioned the Emperor&#146;s Personal Shuttle, this one is handy in a pinch.  The Emperor&#146;s freedom of movement in space is not limited at all, just at sites, so you can tuck him inside his shuttle with a pilot and get 2 flips with total immunity to attrition.  Or just use it as a cheap 2 ability ship with 5 forfeit, good forfeit fodder, especially with Fighers Coming In.<br>
<br>
  But your best friend may well be Major Mianda.  He and Hebsley are a must, along with Scythe 1 and 3, their matching TIEs.  These ships can fire during the move phase, after you&#146;ve already embarked them in a Star Destroyer for the trip to a nearby system and disembarked.  This means the Rebels can&#146;t run from you.  It also means you can gun down their fleet without battling.<br>
  <br>
  Mianda adds 2 to weapon destiny, so setting him up on either Scythe will be bad news for the opponent.  The best TIE cannon available in this format, where the Interceptor&#146;s guns from Special Edition aren&#146;t allowed, is the SFS TIE Cannon from DSII.  Straight flip to beat armor or maneuver, no penalty.  With a little destiny tracking, you can gun down some pretty big ships, I&#146;ve shot down Home One using this trick.  Also General Cal in Gold Squadron 1, Wedge in RS1, etc.  <br>
<br>
  Fighter Cover removes some of the need to track precisely by giving you two tries, canceling and redrawing one of your weapon destiny.  Makes it much easier to hit a big target, and when you actually get into a battle, fire the weapon for power +3, nifty.  Other starship weapons in the deck may include the Heavy Turbolaser Battery, although it is only very useful with destiny tracking, Figher Cover (redraw works with capitals, too) or Judicator.  Not useful by itself.  <br>
<br>
  And Intruder Missles just to have 7 destiny cards to recirculate with Janus or other cards to be drawn for battle or weapon destiny.  But tossing in a TIE Defender or two to actually use these might not hurt.  In conjunction with a TIE Cannon and perhaps Fighter Cover, you could hunt the big ships.  <br>
<br>
  We&#146;ve covered pilots for the starfighters, for the big capitals we want Admiral Piett and Chiraneau, Commander Merrejk, the previously mentioned Sarkli, and perhaps some of the common and uncommon ones.  If you&#146;re running short on room, rely on the walker and TIE pilots as a reserve of pilots for big ships if it proves necessary.  Remember that Barich&#146;s text works in space if he&#146;s with another biker scout, and pair him up with Elsek if things are rougher up there than on the ground.  You can&#146;t use the Elsek lock, but if you occupy Carida, at least you can get him back every turn for more reusable forfeit fodder.    <br>
<br>
  Imperial Command will get you those Admirals, and when it grabs Piett, a landslide of card downloads can have you established in space and on the ground if you&#146;ve got the force to spend.  It then keeps the opponent from getting lots of flips in space while Battle Deployment gives him a similar treatment on the ground.  <br>
  <br>
  Easily the three best systems, in addition to Carida, of which you might decide to fit just two in, are Endor, Sullust, and Mon Calamari.  Holding Mon Calamari keeps the big ships from beating you down, driving up their deploy and keeping them from deploying there, just watch out, it could be converted on you.  Merrejk can grab these for you, just choose wisely when deciding what to use Piett&#146;s once per game pull text on, him or Igar, or an AO.  <br>
<br>
  The rest of the red should be Imperial Arrest Order and Mobilization Points for force generation, Combat Response to get the TIEs out, Force Lightning, and a couple Operational As Planned for recycling those Intruder Missles.<br>
<br>
  If you find yourself going well above 60 cards, you may lean more heavily towards space and go with a lighter ground force.  Playing a ground focused deck doesn&#146;t appeal to me because of the lack of a Merrejk equivalent to grab sites, and the easier time DS has when there aren&#146;t a lot of sites out to control.  Best to go trounce your opponent when he spreads.  <br>
<br>
  Worst case, it&#146;ll turn out to be an all space game, you&#146;ll be ready, and you&#146;ll be draining for up to 3 at the Landing Platform between the Emperor, Janus, and Fighters Coming In.  Not bad.<br>
<br>
  That should get you started in this format where Dark Side is concerned.  Next time I&#146;ll discuss Light Side and do a walkthrough on a powerful LS space deck in the Closed Environment.   <br>
<br>
  Have fun out there.<br>
