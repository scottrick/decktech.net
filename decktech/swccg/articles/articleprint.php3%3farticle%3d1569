Mike Fitzgerald performed a similar miracle a while ago.  I will be narrower, but more detailed, explaining mechanics rather than cards.  Veteran manipulators this is your last warning, you may already know most of this stuff.	I may be prematurely whining, but anybody who's read any of my articles knows that I put a lot of effort into them, so don't rate me low because I &quot;wasted your time&quot;.  Now on to the meat.<br>
<br>
There are two types of manipulation: Self-manipulation and the other variety.<br>
<br>
I won't delve into self-manipulation too much; it varies from deck to deck.  For the truly clueless, here's a short list of the most popular self-manipulating cards for the LS:<br>
<br>
The Signal<br>
Tunnel Vision<br>
Traffic Control<br>
<br>
Basically self manipulation involves getting cards you need into hand or on the table, and high destiny cards back in your reserve deck in a manner so you can track them.<br>
<br>
Manipulating your opponent largely consists of four things:<br>
	1 - Gaining a mental advantage.  In the words of the great Mike Fitzgerald, manipulation is designed to beat your opponent, not your opponent's deck.<br>
	2 - Interaction, both direct and indirect, with the cards in your opponent's hand.<br>
	3 - Degradation of opponent's card efficiency.<br>
<br>
How do these things work?  I'll begin with the simplest: destroying their card efficiency.<br>
<br>
Battle Plan is the most often played of these things.  It forces the opponent to either establish a presence in space and on the ground or pay three for each force drain.  This is biggest early and late in the game.  Early on you may save yourself a drain of one or two because the opponent would rather spend that force deploying.  Later on they may not be able to afford to drain because they are running low on force.  The bottom line is, if the opponent has to pay for drains they either won't drain, or you'll out deploy them.  Wars Not Make One Great is another effect that can ruin efficiency.  For those who are locked up in a cave, (Side Note: I hope I'm not offended anybody with these remarks! J), WNMOG forces both players to pay an additional force for each battle or force drain.  This is great if you are relying on fewer drains because it can't be suspended by accomplishing a given task such as occupying a space and ground BG.  Some people might balk at the insignificance of paying one per drain, but it makes a big difference when you are trying to stack destinies or limit your activation so you can search for something more effectively.<br>
<br>
Example: They have a tracked 7 eleven cards down.  Naturally they activate 11 cards, putting the seven on top for battle destiny.  In hand they have Vader and Tarkin, (Classic, no?).	For one reason or another you got Melas all alone at a site.  Prime beatdown material for opponent.  EXCEPT THEY HAVE TO PAY 2 TO INITIATE.  They need 12 force.  Okay, the tracked seven is twelve cards down, giving them enough for the beat down.  Now they can't force drain because it costs one each time.  Don't tell me Wars Not Make One Great isn't a powerful card.<br>
<br>
Catch cards, (For the truly new, I am referring to What're You Trying to Push On Us?), are also popular manipulation, but not often seen as manipulation because they are designed to work against opponent's manipulation and other such cheese.  Think about the card more carefully and you'll realize it can destroy efficiency.  In it you are given the following powers:<br>
	You can remove ANY interrupt from circulation.	They can't draw it for destiny, use it again, lose it to a force drain, retrieve it or use it as a generic force from the Force pile.<br>
	You compoundly increase the cost of all subsequent copies of said interrupt.  All these copies befall the fate of the original interrupt.<br>
	Finally, and most importantly, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THE OPPONENT CAN DO ABOUT IT.  Some of you vets might want to yell, &quot;Frustration&quot; in my ear.  F**k that, I'll just catch your Frustration J.<br>
Needless to say, catch cards are versatile and powerful.  One of the best cards in the game without a doubt.<br>
<br>
The other major method of destroying efficiency is increasing deployment costs for your opponent.  The most common of these for the LS is the well-known Sped effect Goo Nee Tay, increasing the cost of most good characters by two, (Except of course all the 2-2 scrubs used in Big Blue).  The effects of making things more expensive should be obvious after my extrapolation of Battle Plan and WNMOG.  For the obsessive, Restricted Deployment increases the cost of all warriors by 1.  This may not seem like much, but check your favorite characters and see how many of them are warriors.  You might be surprised, (Heck, JABBA is a warrior for crying out loud).<br>
<br>
Finally, there are lock-down tactics.  The popular ones for the LS are Frozen Assets, Beggar, and Draw Their Fire.  Draw Their Fire adds a cost of 1 to every interrupt the opponent plays during a battle you initiate.  Wanna make sure that beatdown goes through?  This is the way to go.  They have to pay to Ghhhhk, Duel, Sense, All Power to Weapons, Trample, etc.  Okay so they save force.  With Beggar you can use their force to help deploy your stuff, leaving them with no force in a situation where nothing's free.	Stops reacts pretty good too.  Frozen Assets won't let you use their force, but it still prevents THEM from using it.	Same effect, they can't Ghhhhk or play any other life saving interrupt during battle.	Beggar and FA each have their advantages.  Beggar is more versatile.  You can chip away at force they are saving and use 1 of their force during your turn.  So what?  Well, for 1 force you can: Rebel Barrier, Hyper Escape, React, Pay for your Houjix when they play First Strike.	Also you can add some extra surprise value.  Save 1 force and then use that one force plus one of theirs to react the Spiral.  Save two and use it plus theirs to play It's a Trap!  The possibilities are endless.  If they save a bunch use it all to help fund your own endeavors, just make sure to run multiples of Beggar.  FA is simpler, but it's free, immune to Alter, and does not require a Tatooine site to deploy to.<br>
<br>
Moving on to the more amusing aspect of manipulation, interaction with your opponent's hand.  Simplest form of this is probably Stone Pile, which directly ganks the cards straight from their hand.  The implications of this should be obvious, but I will provide an example from one of my decks.<br>
<br>
I ran an HBX deck with Stone Piles, (Hey, you can easily pull Dagobah and then your candidate site).  They'd throw out Security Precautions to begin probing and protect themselves from an X-Wing beating.  Good strategy, no?  They deploy, probe, move and wait for my deploy phase so they can probe again.  Cool.  My control phase, I drain.  They lose from hand down to two cards so they can probe.  First action during my deploy phase?  Deploy Stone Pile, grabbing those two cards, preventing them from probing and protecting themselves from a beatdown.  Har Har, no?  Just an example of what messing with their hand can do.  Or maybe they haven't come to space yet.  You drain, they go down to 2-4 cards, all BH ships because they need to probe, you get rid of two of 'em.  You drain, they lose down to two, (Vader and Tarkin for a ground pounding), and you take 'em out with Stone Pile.  You get it opening hand.  Play it just to piss 'em of.  The list goes on and on.	Simple, yet elegant and brutal.  That's what manipulation is all about.<br>
<br>
Okay, now for something more complex: The Shasa Tiel - Oola - Grimtaash combo, (For the DS this translates into A Dangerous Time - Monnok - Miy'oom Onith).<br>
<br>
Breakdown of what they do in case you don't already know -<br>
<br>
Shasa Tiel: Reorganizes opponent's force pile to your liking during their control phase, (Like you'd want to play it any other time). Costs 3 force.<br>
<br>
Oola: Sends all male unique Imperials and Aliens in opponent's hand to used pile.  Costs X force.  X = size of opponent's hand.  Works only during your control phase.<br>
<br>
Grimtaash:  Used function is free.  If opponent has 13 or more cards, all but 8 go to Used Pile.  Lost function costs 4.  Opponent reveals hand.  All duplicates are lost.<br>
<br>
If you're a newbie an don't fully realize the power, the basic gimmick is using Shasa Tiel to see what cards opponent will draw so you know what's in their hand.  You'll know when they have dupes and you'll know when they have characters worth hitting with Oola.<br>
<br>
There is more, of course.<br>
<br>
The general strategy with Shasa Tiel is to order the cards in the force pile with these two guidelines:<br>
1) Place all duplicates together.<br>
2) Organize the cards by destiny.  Lowest destiny on top, highest on bottom.<br>
<br>
Keeping duplicates together increases your chances of a successful Grimtaash Lost.<br>
Organizing by destiny as such means that they recycle their low destinies and draw the high ones.  In most cases it also means they won't draw their characters.<br>
What if they draw up most or all of the pile, getting their useful low destiny cards into hand?  If they drew up a whole pile, they'll likely have a hand of 13 or more.  Grimtaash Used and then you can afford Oola to clean up the survivors.  Also, remember to drain before using Oola because they might lose from hand, making Oola much more affordable.<br>
<br>
So what?  Try playing any deck without characters.  It sucks.  What if they're playing females?  Mara Jade's the only powerful one.  You can handle ONE main, right?	What if they play non-uniques?	Hello Grimtaash Lost.  No, it's not invincible, but it sure as hell is powerful.<br>
<br>
Of course, sometimes your Shasa Tiel strategy will change.  Against Ralltiir, you'd probably put all the characters together regardless of destiny and likely put them at the top.  This way they will have to waste a turn to draw up and get their characters and then they become easy targets for Oola.  If you can prevent the flip, Ralltiir ain't so great.  Against BHBM or Hunt Down, you'll want to keep Vader at the top before the zero destiny cards.  To get Vader into hand they'll have to lose a turn and draw up, and in that situation they, (Say it with me now), are easy targets for Oola.<br>
<br>
You want more?	Throw Leesub Sirin into the mix.  If they aren't careful and you have a real good memory and eye, you can &quot;guess&quot; correctly every time.  Now you have power beyond just keeping characters off the table.  Don't like that Boba Fett in Slave I you saw with Shasa?  Remember were you put it, see if it makes it to their hand, keep an eye on it, then use Leesub, point to it and say &quot;starship&quot;.  Har Har.  Of course they are allowed to jumble up their hand.  If they prove this intelligent and you still want to use Leesub, then keep cards types together when using Shasa, this way you increase your chances of guessing correctly because they will draw a lot of one type.<br>
<br>
All these techniques can definitely afford you a mental advantage, the ultimate goal of the manipulator.  But there are specific cards that can aid in this category directly, the best known of which is Eyes in the Dark.  Eyes in the Dark turns a Lost Pile upside down.  You do this to your opponent and they don't know what they lose when it comes from the reserve deck.  Talk about freaky.  They could be sitting there wondering if they lost a crucial card a couple turns ago.	If they search for something and don't see it, is it in their force pile ready to be drawn up, or in their lost pile doomed for eternity?  Nobody knows.  Hilarious.<br>
<br>
So you can manipulate the hell, out of your opponent, so what?	You have to be able to turn this into damage.  Civil Disorder is one good route.  Do your darndest to keep cards with ability out of their hand and they'll keep losing two each turn.  Visored Vision is another option.  With Shasa Tiel you'll know what's in their used pile, which will make playing VV much more effective.  Limiting their deployment might also put them in unfavorable situations, so OTE could prove hugely effective.  Remember that the damage only needs be reliable, not huge, because a manipulator will likely prevent a lot of damage by virtue of limiting characters and eliminating key cards.<br>
<br>
There is more, but I believe my work here is done.  If you read this whole thing and didn't learn ANYTHING then you're either a retard at the game or a grizzled veteran who was rightly warned ahead of time.<br>
<br>
For the true newbies, whom this article is dedicated to, if you are unfamiliar with any cards mentioned, just d-mail me and I will explain them in detail, (My goal was to help, no?).	Thanks for reading!<br>
