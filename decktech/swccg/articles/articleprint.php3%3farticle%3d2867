Your Insight Serves You Well and Honor Of The Jedi.  When these cards were released, almost every light side player started Your Insight Serves You Well with the new starting interrupt, Heading For The Medical Frigate, and then immediately put it in the lost pile to pull out Honor Of The Jedi.  This was a great way to stop things like Fear, Limited Resources, damage incurred from the Court Of The Vile Gangster objective, damage from Your Destiny, even damage from There Is No Try, so that if they were careful, a light side player could play Sense and Alter without losing the two force.  And most importantly, it stopped damage from Visage of the Emperor.<br>
<br>
Then Jabba’s Palace Sealed Deck came out.  No Escape is released, and many say Honor of the Jedi is now a dead card.  As a result, Your Insight Serves You Well is seen less frequently.  <br>
<br>
This article is about why this card is still good, and why everyone should have it in their deck.<br>
<br>
Every single part of this card is useful, and the new combo version, Your Insight Serves You Well &amp; Staging Areas, has the same great effects and a +1 generation at docking bays.  This is what the original card looks like:<br>
<br>
Destiny 5<br>
Deploy on table.  Opponent’s Dark Jedi are defense value -1.  Scanning Crew and 3,720 To 1 are cancelled.  You may place Effect in Lost Pile to take one (Endor) or (Death Star 2) Effect that deploys for free into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.  (Immune To Alter.)<br>
<br>
The first and last lines of the game text mean that you can start it with Heading For The Medical Frigate, as I already stated previously.  You can also start this effect with Podrace Prep, which allows you some versatility in your podracing decks.  A nice advantage, since you can only start one effect.  <br>
<br>
The next line of the text is one of the most powerful.  “Opponent’s Dark Jedi are defense value -1.”  With cards like The Phantom Menace giving Darth Maul a defense value of 8, Emperor Palpatine being a defense value of 7, and Lord Vader armed with his lightsaber being a defense value of 8, the Light Side needs all the help it can get in gunning these guys down.  Since Palpatine is immune to attrition, Maul would be immune to attrition with The Phantom Menace out, and Lord Vader is immune &lt; 6, hitting these guys with a weapon could be the only way to get them off the table.  This is where Insight comes in.  In order to hit Palpatine, you need to draw a total of 7 for your weapon destiny, and to hit Darth Maul or Lord Vader you need to draw an 8.  This may not seem like much of a difference, but what it means is that Han with Heavy Blaster Pistol, with a tracked 6-destiny (of which the Light Side has many) could gun down the leader of the Galactic Empire, Palpatine himself.  With a tracked Intruder Missile, Han with his gun can hit any dark side character in the game.  It gets even easier when Luke, Obi-Wan or Qui-Gon pick up their lightsabers and go to work.  A pair of 4-destinies hits anything in the game.  That effect alone is enough to make me play this card in my decks.  But we’re only on the second line of the game text!<br>
<br>
Remember way back around the time of the Dagobah expansion?  The insert card 3,720 To 1 comes out, and suddenly there is a wave of “numbers” decks.  The strategy was pretty unstoppable unless you were playing numbers yourself, and in a lot of cases a few R2 droids and a Bith Musician could take out the entire Rebel Alliance in just a couple of turns.  Jabba’s Palace brings us Don’t Forget The Droids, and players started packing three copies of this card in their deck just to take care of 3,720 To 1.  It is a destiny-6 card, but still has very specific uses if you aren&#146;t using it against a numbers deck.  Your Insight Serves You Well took care of that card economy problem.  One card on the table, and 3,720 To 1 can’t even come near your deck.  The same is true of Scanning Crew.  This Premiere interrupt was one of the most inconvenient in the game, because it steadily depleted your supply of characters to put on the table.  Your opponent has a huge advantage against you if you are unable to put anyone on the table.  But with Insight, Scanning Crew is just a dead 3-destiny card floating around in their deck, and your characters are free to stay in your hand for a while.<br>
<br>
Finally we come to the most widely-used part of the card, the line that allows you to take a Death Star 2 or Endor effect that deploys for free into hand from your reserve deck.  As I already said, this is most commonly used for Honor Of The Jedi.  However, there are many other uses for this card:<br>
<br>
I Hope She’s All Right: This card is great to pull out if your opponent just draws their first turn, or if they’re playing some kind of space deck.  They lose a force every turn just because you have characters at some sites and they don’t.<br>
<br>
I Wonder Who They Found, Count Me In, I’m With You Too, and That’s One: This is a weird little series of effects that can buff up your mains and destiny-adders a little bit.  A lot of players don’t use these cards because the rewards of the combo aren’t worth the time it takes to set it up.  Insight can help you get them out a little faster.<br>
<br>
Close Air Support: This card is positively huge in Rebel Strike Team, and I have even seen it used in Quiet Mining Colony and Watch Your Step.  Great to get out early in the game.<br>
<br>
Honor Of The Jedi: As I mentioned, pulling this card is the most common use of Insight.  Unless your opponent starts No Escape, it will give you a couple of turns of protection against sources of direct damage, and it also changed the face of Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi.  In the words of Brian Hunter, “Alters are no longer optional.”<br>
<br>
Launching The Assault: You can start Insight as one of your three effects, immediately lose it for Launching The Assault, and have Home One out of your deck and in your hand on the first turn of the game.  Put it down a couple of turns later with Ackbar and force drain +1 there.  A good card to put on Kessel or Special Edition Coruscant for a nice fat drain of 4.<br>
<br>
Squadron Assignments: I use Insight in my Watch Your Step racing deck just to get it out faster.  Insight is great to include in multiples in any racing decks because in the early game, it’s a lot better than We Wish To Board At Once because it’s free and is untouchable by grabbers or Sense.<br>
<br>
Strikeforce:  This card is great in Watch Your Step, too, and it’s not immune to Alter so you have to play Insight if you want to get it out quickly.  It keeps your drains safe, and also cancels Counter Assault (opponent can’t cancel your drains), which can be horrible against Watch Your Step.<br>
<br>
Your Insight Serves You Well: Yes, you can even use Insight to pull Insight.  I don’t know why you’d want to, but the option is still open to you if you want to get a laugh from your opponent.<br>
<br>
Obviously these are not the only effects Insight can pull out for you, but with the exception of Squadron Assignments, they are cards that you can’t start with Heading For The Medical Frigate, and that is what Insight was designed to do – get out those effects that you can’t start with.<br>
<br>
The only real weakness that Your Insight Serves You Well has lies in the combo card that I mentioned earlier.  If your opponent plays Fanfare and manages to keep you out of space, you will be unable to use any of Insight’s game text.  That is why unless you play an objective that starts with a system on the table, such as Watch Your Step or Quiet Mining Colony, or an objective that allows you to pull systems from your deck, like Hidden Base, I recommend using the original version of the card over the combo.<br>
<br>
As you can see, Your Insight Serves You Well is a great utility card that has a lot of uses.  It truly belongs in every light side deck just because of the sheer number of effects that it has on the outcome of the game.  It has pulled me out of many tight spots, and can do the same for you.  Even if you don’t start with it, it is a destiny-5 card and that’s not a bad thing.  After all, with Insight on the table, a destiny-5 card will let Leia pick up her blaster and take out The Emperor’s Hand!<br>
