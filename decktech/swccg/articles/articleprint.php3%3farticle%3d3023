I&#39;ll start off with some examples that have made the difference in a game with me.<br>
<br>
First off at one of the more recent LotR tourney&#39;s I played in I bluffed my way to victory. I was playing my good friend Justin and he had just moved to site 4 and had no minions left to face, (they were all either dead or on swarms). I looked at him across the table and said outright &quot;Move again and you will die&quot; using a very serious tone and keeping eye contact. At the time I had 1 goblin runner and 7 free people&#39;s cards in my hand, and jack on the swarms, I may have placed 2-3 wounds but nothing more. My bluff worked and he stayed, during my turn I played 6 of the 7 Fellowship cards in my hand and drew up some big nasty Moria stuff. On his Free People turn he died.<br>
<br>
Bluffing played a huge role there, <br>
1. It bought me a turn to get more shadow ie. card advantage<br>
2. He stayed underground so my Cave Troll was cheaper<br>
3. I got a site ahead of him<br>
4. The look on his face was priceless<br>
<br>
Bluffing also works in the opposite way, you can pretend to have an awful hand and have a great one, or you can bluff about bluffing. I will provide an example about each.<br>
<br>
One game I was playing my friend Adam, and he moved to site 7 and I had 8 Shadow Cards in my hand, throughout his entire turn I kept muuttering about how nice a few minions would be and what not. I discarded a useless Shadow Card and drew another, not even glancing at the pool, (I calculated it during his turn and needed more twilight to do what I wanted). Almost without hesitation he said &quot;Bring on the next site&quot; and I promptly said &quot;Bend over and grab your ankles&quot;<br>
<br>
Another time, I was reallly melodramatic about my hand, saying how my friend would be clobberd if he moved two sites blah blah blah, (the usual smack talk). The few minions I played led him to believe I was lying and he moved again to his doom.<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure I have shown how bluffing can be an effective tool in gameplay. But how exactly does one bluff? There are several important things to consider when bluffing:<br>
1. Eye contact, always keep a straight face (a poker face) and look them dead in the eye. This will help your credibility and also make them a bit ill at ease.<br>
2. Mannerisms, if you want to fake that you have a bad hand, then look angry, mutter to yourself, and sacrifice a few minions if you can to show how horrid your shadow is doing.<br>
3. Tone, always try to maintain a serious tone, don&#39;t laugh or flash a wicked grin until they have already walked into thier grave. <br>
4. Hint at what will come kill them ex. &quot;What has 15 str, Dmg +1 and is fierce? You&#39;ll find out if you move&quot;<br>
<br>
A combination of these, when used properly and effectively can sometimes let you manipulate your opponent into doing what you want. Granted not all buffs are guarunteed, but few people would want to try thier luck against one. Bluffing is an important practice because it lets you control the game, and in some of the more extreme cases I&#39;ve seen, if you control the game you&#39;ll be moving to site 9 and your opponent will be curled up in a ball at site 5 dreading what will come if he/she moves. <br>
<br>
Bluffing is the psychological aspect of LotR, the cards are one thing, but having your opponent think the Cave Troll is in your hand can sometimes be just as good as having one in your hand. By planting doubt and fear in your opponent&#39;s head, they will not play at 100% they start to make mistakes and this is when you promptly take advantage of them and as I did at the chase the can tourney, take thier can of beans and move up in the pairings.<br>
<br>
I hope this article helped some people out, keep in mind this is only a scratch on the surface of the art of bluffing and was intended to help newer players, please rate it with that in mind. D-Mail me if you want more example, funny stories, or advice. Good luck to all of you and if you give me less than 5 stars the Cave Troll will destroy you... (jk lol)<br>
