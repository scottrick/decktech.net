Introduction:<br>
<br>
    I have been a part of the SWCCG universe almost since its birth.  Although just recently being able to get into the tournament scene, I have always tried to stay abreast of what was going on, what decks worked, and what decks were becoming obsolete (though not always too successfully).  When the Dagobah expansion was released the Jedi Tests interested me, but I dismissed them, as a training deck seemed to slow and card intensive.  Instead, I drooled over the seemingly invincible Executor.<br>
<br>
    Time passed, and along came Special Edition and objectives.  Most people were engrossed in Hidden Base and ISB decks, and hey, Wise Advise lets any card canceled by Sense or Alter go to your used pile.  I'm sure a few people out there jumped all over MWYHL right away, seeing its power, but I am sometimes a little slow, and try as I might, not really that inventive when it comes to new deck techniques.  I suppose that is why no one has ever heard of Justin Brinkerhoff.<br>
<br>
    But to continue, with the release of Endor and Daughter of Skywalker, something finally clicked.  Reading her game text and the part about being targeted by MWYHL finally made me look at it.  I saw another deck design that trained Luke, and really liked the look of it.  I looked a little deeper into the subject, and found what I thought was just about the greatest thing ever.	A trained DoS, On The Edge, Reflection.  Again and again and again.  Infinite force retrieval, a permanent 7, and no stopping me!<br>
<br>
    I was at school at the time, but looked around for ideas, bought the cards I needed on e-bay, and when I went home for the summer, went to a tournament with my &quot;perfected&quot; deck, and along with a pretty solid Hunt Down, won it.  It has gone through a couple of tournaments now undefeated, and in fact, there were more like it at one, and I was unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of its power.  I was not happy at all, needless to say, and vowed to take it down.  I looked into it, got ideas from other players, and the following is a summation of my studies...<br>
<br>
II. The Standard Training Deck:<br>
<br>
    The strategy of most training decks is such: slow the game to an absolute crawl, losing as little force as possible while training, and once training is over, come after you with an almost indestructible force.	The following cards are the makeup of a standard deck:<br>
<br>
MWYHL/SYIC-  no explanation necessary<br>
Yoda-  the mentor<br>
Either Luke or DoS-  the apprentice<br>
Yoda's Hope, Luke's Backpack, Wise Advice, Reflection- training helpers<br>
The Way Of Things- Totally skips two turns<br>
On The Edge/Off The Edge- wherever they chose to battle, this supplies the infinite force retrieval<br>
Anger, Fear, Aggression/Uncontrollable Fury-  often included to cause quite a bit of damage in the mean time<br>
<br>
Plus, the ways to slow the game:<br>
<br>
Undercover Spies- block the force drain<br>
Arconas-  block a force drain, react away, can drain also<br>
Landing Claws- block the drain in space<br>
It could Be Worse- although often risky, it doesn't apply here, since once 1st test is done, It's Worse is just another drain modifier<br>
Projection of A Skywalker- once 1st test past, reduce a couple of drains to absolutely nothing<br>
Honor of A Jedi- takes care of Visage and such for a while<br>
Transmission Terminated- even by the time you occupy 3 battlegrounds and suspend HOJ, they cancel Visage<br>
Endor Celebration- cancel any of the Occupations, and immune to sense<br>
<br>
Plus, included will be the 5 or 6 tests, a couple of ships, and a bunch of enhanced characters along with a load of D7 cards.<br>
<br>
III. The Strength Of A Training Deck:<br>
<br>
	The strengths of this deck are quite clear.<br>
<br>
  1) Many dark side decks are drain monsters.  They rely    on many FD +1 locations, characters and such.  Completing Test 1 is like de-clawing a big cat.<br>
<br>
  2) Secondly, they can cancel a lot of other damage such as what little the dark side can drain for.  They now have the cat on a chain.<br>
<br>
  3) Third, they most likely have A LOT of retrieval.  The poor cat just got de-fanged too.<br>
<br>
  4) And then to top it all off, when completed, forget it.  The cat is shoved into a tiny cage and broken.  Game over.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV. The Weaknesses Of The Training Deck:<br>
<br>
	Since we are all big-cat lovers, we don&amp;#8217;t want that to happen.  So we need to look at that blasted deck and find its weaknesses....<br>
<br>
  1) This deck takes a long time to complete.  Especially in these days of activating 15 force by your third turn, training is relatively long.  Even at the very fastest, it takes 7 turns to complete test 5.  With one or two unlucky draws, it will be more.  We can use this to get set up against it.<br>
<br>
  2) It doesn&amp;#8217;t have much protection against direct damage.<br>
<br>
  3) +4 to Sense and Alter draws.<br>
<br>
  4) Jedi tests are suspended when apprentice is not on the table.  This might get overlooked, but could be absolutely lifesaving.<br>
<br>
  5) It is a pretty predictable deck.<br>
<br>
  6) It is very reliant on good destiny draws and tracking.<br>
<br>
V. Taking It Down Baby!!!<br>
<br>
	Now that we have studied the enemy and know him better than he knows himself, we are prepared to destroy and humiliate him.  So let&amp;#8217;s go...<br>
<br>
	1) Don&amp;#8217;t Let Him Train:<br>
<br>
		First things first.  The deck is totally about getting the apprentice trained.	Any thing we can do to slow or even totally prevent the training process will help our cause.  To begin, we will go with the obvious.  Broken concentration.  On the first test, it subtracts 4 from the training destiny.  The only ways test 1 can be passed with it on the table is DoS, Yoda, Wise Advice, Backpack, Hope, Reflection, and a D7 draw, or Jedi Luke with all the adders.  Both are hard to accomplish, and things are looking good for us, even if it only slows them down.	Now, we go and add to that He Is Not Ready.  That subtracts another two.  Now, with both on the table, even with an At Peace, which many players don&amp;#8217;t play with, he can only pass one test!	The key now is keeping them on the table.<br>
<br>
	Both of those cards are not immune to Alter, but not to fear.  By default, 4 is added to the destiny draw.  Even with Yoda, they need to draw a 2, which should be hard with all the high destiny draws in their deck.	Now, if you want some more reassurance, here is how to take care of that and make sure those cards stay on the table.  The sure-fire way is play a Hunt Down deck.  Though less popular these days, I still believe in this objective.	If HDADTJ is face up, no altering will ever happen.  If you don&amp;#8217;t deploy Vader, it will never flip.  You will take damage, but most likely will be making him lose a lot more with drains going on and any other damage.  Even HOJ should be suspended in a couple of turns, and you can be pretty sure you should e able to win any battles that he tries to throw at you with his limited amount of characters.  Now if you don&amp;#8217;t like Hunt Down, but still want to keep BC and HINR out, how about Dark Forces?	Exclude Yoda, and any Obi they throw out and make them draw a 0.  And that card is good for any sense or alter they play.  Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
	2) Take Him Apart As he Trains:<br>
<br>
		As stated before, tracking destiny is critical for that deck.  Anything that disrupts this is helpful.	Some great cards for this are Sim Alou and the all-powerful OMNI BOX.  Any other cards that allow you to mess with his destiny draws will absolutely wreak havoc on him.  And all the while, you are...<br>
<br>
	Going back to the predictability of the deck, we will start to hurt him other ways.  If he is using It Could Be Worse, There Could Be Hell To Pay it.  If he is using Arconas, a Sense will take care of a react too, or something that doesn&amp;#8217;t allow reacts, like CZ-4, will absolutely devastate him.  If your deck is based on a ground drain, Trample, Hutt Smooch, or Sniper will take care of spies, or throw in a Bubo to take care of anything but Bousch, which they are unlikely to have.  For a space drain, Homing Beacon is your key.  So while you are hurting him and slowing him down, you are also getting ready to take him out.<br>
<br>
	3) He Is Going To Flip:<br>
<br>
		So it is inevitable that he is going to flip, and you are rightfully worried.  Fear not my child, there is still hope.	By this time he has that 7 tracked and so ready to pull for test 5.  Right before he is about to pull it, Omni Box him if possible and hope for the best.<br>
<br>
	Ok, so you don&amp;#8217;t have an Omni Box, Sim Alou, or he is going to have that 7 no matter what you do.   Now is when we are going to have to resort to the simple fact that the tests are ignored while the apprentice is not on the table.  Most likely they will be playing test 6, and are about to come after Vader.  Here it is going to take some knowledge of the cards involved, concentration and destiny tracking of your own.  He can now come after and duel Vader to pass test 6, and will most likely be packing a 7.  Fortunately for you, he, not passing test 6 yet, is still only ability 5.  If you can track a 6, he will not be able to pass the test.  So now is the time to take him out for good.	He couldn&amp;#8217;t battle the turn before, but now you do.  If you have DVDLOTS and have kept track of that 6, simply choke him, and he is gone.  Keep an eye on that 6, and keep him off the table.  The other way to make him gone is to hit him with a light saber, and then assassinate him with Dr. E.	Then, as long as he stays off the table and you play smart, you have a good chance of winning.	Especially if you have a lot of direct damage going at this time such as an Occupation, That Thing&amp;#8217;s Operational, or a We&amp;#8217;re In Attack Position Now, you will be in good shape.<br>
<br>
VI. Conclusion:<br>
<br>
	The training deck is a strong one.  We all know that.	Now, hopefully we can all see that it is in no way invincible, and with some smart play, can be defeated pretty easily.  Now it is hard to squeeze a deck into only 60 cards, and when you have a good deck, it is always hard to take apart in any way.  Hopefully I have given you many ways to play against a training deck that are also useful against a multitude of decks.  Just as a quick example, Omni Box is a card that I love, and is useful against any deck that tracks destiny in any way.<br>
<br>
	Hopefully I have not made a fool of myself in my endeavors to express my feelings and opinions to the SWCCG universe.  Please leave your comments, as I greatly appreciate them, and feel free to email me with any questions or just to talk about the game.<br>
