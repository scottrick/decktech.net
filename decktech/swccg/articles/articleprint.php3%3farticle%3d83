Manipulation being harassing your opponent's life force. The point of Dark Side Manipulation is to repeatedly use manip cards to throw off the person's game plan and leave themself open to a game ending beatdown.<br>
<br>
	a.) Battle Order -- nasty little card that makes the opponent pay 3 force to drain which can be particularly irritating if those 3 cards are the cards they were looking for. Particularly if those said cards were arranged in that order by A Dangerous Time.<br>
<br>
	b.) A Dangerous Time -- Used or Lost Destiny 3 card. Used Function lets you arrange their force pile however you want. Usefull for setting up Monnoks , manuevering around mains , or just annoying the opponent. Lost Function of going to get Dark Forces is under-rated since Dark Forces is a good Anti-SAC card and will help you a bit against Counter Assault w/ the low number of characters in most manip decks.<br>
<br>
	c.) Mi'oom Onith -- Use X force to reveal their hand and wipe out all their * Unique non-droid characters. Problem is Goo Nee Tay nullifies her. Loses force to Shocking Information might be worth it depending on what you knock out. Very dangerous with Monnok.<br>
<br>
	d.) Monnok -- Pretty obvious here. Use 4 and lose the Monnok to toss all doubles. Or play it used to knock them back down to 8 cards. Also a decent Holotable piece.<br>
<br>
	e.) Scanning Crew -- Again pretty obvious here. Use a Force to toss a Rebel. One of the easiest cards to annoy the opponent into the ground with.<br>
<br>
	f.) Voyeur -- Also another annoying card. Used or Lost Destiny 3. Lets you search their Used Pile and make them lose force for multiple copies in the pile. Chips away at the opponent over time.<br>
<br>
	g.) Broken Concentration -- Aha ! The sleeper of the group. I love this card. First off it stops the opponent from drawing up which is always nice. But lets think of some other nasty combos here. First off there is the A Dangerous Time where you mess with their force pile , then you get to move a card to the top of the pile with this so you can automatically remove one of those EPPs or if you know they need a good destiny you can make it a 0. But that isn't all ! It puts a kink in Jedi Testing and in case you use Sabaac ( don't even think of laughing )... you can put that EPP Han on top of their deck , play Sabaac , and then put him in their lost pile. Not bad eh ?<br>
<br>
	h. ) Sabaac -- I'm pretty sure I didn't list this in the LS means but now the more i think about this the more it should be in here  . But Sabaac is better for DS then LS just because of Broken Concentration. Sabaac lets you know what is in the opponent's deck and if your able to analyze decks good like me ; you'll remove their counters to your deck before they get into hand. Broken Concentration just makes this all the more painful.<br>
<br>
	i. ) First Strike -- requires them to save force to play interrupts. Again Broken Concentration can insure that the force they are saving is wasted being used ;)<br>
<br>
	j. ) Defensive Fire -- destiny 3 Used interrupt. Randomly select a card from opponent's hand and put it in the Used Pile. Nasty when their hand is small and they are trying to hold on to the bare essentials.<br>
<br>
	k. ) Close Call - Destiny 2. Lost Interrupt ( for purposes of looking at Manip). Lose 1 force. Opponent reveals top card of active , reserve , and used pile. Lowest destiny card(s) are lost. Hmm. Sounds like a good mix of A Dangerous Time and Broken Concentration ( see a pattern ? )  is the best way to line up the effectiveness of this card.<br>
<br>
	l. ) Fear - Destiny 2 . Lost Interrupt . Opponent loses 2 force from hand or one from Reserve. Hmmm... they might think a bit longer about that proposition if you ADT'd their force pile and used Broken Concentration :P OR if you have Your Eyes Can Deceive You on the table.<br>
<br>
	m. ) Uncertain is the Future - Destiny 3 Lost Interrupt. Good way to get rid of a bad hand you have or get back your manip if it is clumped together or if you want to get rid of a main they were actually able to get into their hand.<br>
<br>
	n. ) 3720 to 1 / Inserts -- Messes with activation which is very nasty. Opponent may get nervous if they suspect that Don't Forget the Droids or Ultimatum suddenly was moved by ADT and Broken Concentration. With A Disturbance in the Force or Knowledge and Defense hitting at the right time you can be safe for a turn.<br>
<br>
	o. ) He Is Not Ready -- Ugh. I hated this card during Dagobah. This card is a MAJOR pain. Since you probably haven't seen it in awhile I retype it. Destiny 4 Effect. Manip part says : Deploy on opponent's Pilot at a site. During each of opponent's Move phases , opponent must choose to move that character , lose that character , or lose 1 force.  Hmm , Suddenly that EPP Han or EPP Leia at the Lower Corrider has no where to go and either loses a force or is gone. At the very least you know they are goona USE 1 force to move so that ties up a force per turn. [ Insert ADT and Broken Concentration combo in here ] .Sorta like Uncontrollable Fury so that sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
	p.) Probe Droid / Probe Antennae -- Yes. I really dig up the winners ;) With ISB though this can get nasty. Probe Droid with Antennae gets to look at a usual  4 cards	or just usually 2 with the Probe Droid, if he is Undercover there is nothing you can do about it but try to kill him.<br>
<br>
	q.) Set for Stun -- Destiny 2 Lost Interrupt. Track a Masterful Move and move a good character back to their hand. Scanning Crew it into the Used Pile , problem solved. Also seriously cripples Jedi Testing.<br>
<br>
	r.) Imperial Code Cylinder - Destiny 4 Used Interrupt. Imperial Leader at Scomp Link lets you search their reserve for 30 seconds which isn't bad at all. Not bad for a destiny 4 Recycler. Also lets you look at your own and is immune to Scrambled Transmission. Pretty good card with Uncertain is the Future.<br>
<br>
	s.) Probe Telemetry -- Destiny 4 Used Interrupt. Use 2 Force to search any lost pile and place X non-unique cards there out of play , where X=Number of Probe Droids on Table. Not much to work with but may really hurt Ops and SAC decks pretty bad. X-Wing swarm would also be devastated very quickly by this card.<br>
<br>
	t.) Trinto Duaba - Destiny 5 Used Interrupt. Haven't seen this guy in a long time. You search opponent's Used Pile during your battle phase. You draw destiny and any destinies there that match your destiny are lost. Voyeur is better then this though.<br>
<br>
	u.) Secret Plans - Opponent Pays X Force to retrieve X Force. They've gotta keep X Force in their life force so that would affect how much they draw. Deceptive Manipulation.<br>
<br>
	v.) Tusken Scavengers - Destiny 5 . Lost Interrupts. Use a force to draw destiny ; if destiny is less then the number of Tusken Raiders Or Skrillings  on table , you may search through their Used Pile . All Vehicles, Weapons , and Devices are lost. Not really worth it but might hurt a Portable Scanner deck.<br>
<br>
	w.) Macroscan -- Destiny 3 Effect. Use 2 to deploy. At any time you may use a force to peek at top card of deck. If 'nighttime conditions' you get to see the top 3. Good for a HDADTJ Dueling deck or a Drop and Drain ISB. Pretty effective to see if you wanna battle or not.<br>
<br>
	x.) Imperial Domination -- Destiny 5 Effect. . Deploy on any location. If you control it and don't drain they don't get to activate. Only good for like Dagobah , Rendezvous Point or something like that. Decent with Ability Ability Ability or Loc Loc Loc for damage.<br>
<br>
	y.) It's an Older Code -- Use 2 Force and lose this card to Scan opponent's hand and move a Starfighter to the Used Pile. Not very good but every card at the right time can be devastating ;)<br>
<br>
	z.) Conquest -- If you start a battle versus the Falcon you get to see the opponent's hand which is about as much of Manipulation that a big blue deck gets but every little bit counts.<br>
<br>
These along with Helper cards which force the opponent to do X or Lose Y force make DS Manipulation a deadly force. Ability Ability Ability and Location ,Location , Location makes these types of deck pretty tough. But remember Manipulation is meant to beat the player not your deck. For those of you who wanted me to build a deck , I might build a deck later based on this manipulation but if you can't get ANY ideas for Manipulation from this article then I've failed. Advice for those who wanna know how to beat Manip :  'Patience ' . My next article might  be counters for Manipulation if I can make it long enough.<br>
