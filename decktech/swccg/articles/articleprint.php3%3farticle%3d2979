It should be known that I have never met Brian Hunter in person and this is not meant to be insulting in any way towards Brian.  Hopefully, he will be amused by this, as well as anyone else who reads this.<br>
<br>
Brian Hunter:  The Man, The Myth, The Jesus<br>
<br>
Part 1<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve heard many people say they thought he resembled Jesus Christ.  When I met Brian at the big con out west though, I wasn&#146;t expecting this.<br>
<br>
What I saw was a man who looked like he hadn&#146;t eaten or slept in days.  His breathe reaked of alcohol and you could tell that he smoked the reefer.  He stould at about 5&#146;6&quot;.  Couldn&#146;t have weighed more than 150 lbs.  He was dressed in a Flannel Shirt, blue jeans, and boots.  His most noticible feature was his hair.<br>
<br>
...Or should I say the dead animal covering his head and shoulders.  Frizzy long hair stretched down past his shoulders.  He had a beard that covered much of his face and then some.  It was quite a sight.<br>
<br>
Those surrounding us seemed to be much more either like regular functioning members of society or like gamers...or like 6 foot 7 hulks. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, I&#146;m Brian.  You can call me Jesus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...Hello...Jesus.&quot;  It was all I could think to say, and the response was simply given out of habit.  My thoughts couldn&#146;t give way to actual sentences at this point.  What the hell kind of manbeast was I looking at?<br>
<br>
&quot;This your first con?,&quot; the brute asked as I still gazed on in amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm, what...oh uh yea.  Say, has anyone ever told you that you look like something ot of a Magic card?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;What...&quot;  Luckily  the parings were called just then for the first round.  God only knows what kind of acts of indecency Brian was thinking of committing in respone to my last remark.<br>
<br>
.......................................................<br>
<br>
I was doing pretty well for my first con, but that&#146;s unrelated to the rest of our tale, so I won&#146;t get into detail.  Basically I was doing well enough that during the 4th round I got to play against the treefolk himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, how&#146;s it goin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, uh Hey.  Say, sorry about that remark before.  I guess I was pretty out of line.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What remark?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hunh?  Oh, nothing.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Being this close to Hunter allowed me to see him much better.  I can&#146;t say that I liked what I saw.  I couldn&#146;t be sure, but it seemed as if there were little creatures of some sort living in his facial hair.  Not to mention, I detected a smell coming from his backpack throughout the entire game.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of the game, as he was busy whooping me because I could not play under these conditions, I asked, &quot;Hey, whats that smell???&quot;<br>
<br>
The response I got was less than pleasant.  A roar of doom unlike any sound I had ever heard before was emitted from Hunter&#146;s mouth, as his eyes glowed with a crimson beam of death.  <br>
<br>
When it was all over, all I could say was, &quot;uhhh what the hell was that???&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Could it be that he wasn&#146;t conscious of what had just occurred?  Could Brian Hunter, the #1 player in the world possibly be posessed by some unearthly power???  I had to know.<br>
<br>
.......................................................<br>
<br>
After the final game came to a close, I met up with my friend (and the person that I was sharing a hotel room with), Tyler.  Those who knew him called him Tyler D (blatantly obvious and gratuitous Fight Club reference #1).  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Sam, how&#146;d you do?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not too bad.  I played Brian Hunter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Were you scared?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Um do you mean intimidated by his reputation or actually frightened by his disheveled appearance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You weren&#146;t both?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, well I guess I was.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then, Brian passed by us.  &quot;Oh man, I gotta get back to my room.  I&#146;m beat.  Hey it was nice meeting you Sam.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yea.  You too.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he left, carrying his reaking backpack by the strap, hanging at his side.  <br>
<br>
A Cell phone rang.  Several seconds passed before I was able to realize it was mine or even register that there was a phone ringing.  I was staring at Brian walking off into darkness.  This was truly an unsettling image.  <br>
<br>
Tyler D had to slap me in order for me to get the phone.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Dude...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOUR PHONE!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yea...&quot;  I picked up the phone.  &quot;Hello.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sam, it&#146;s Mom.  Just wondering how guys are.  How did you do in the tounament?  Your brother has been blah blah blah blah blah&quot; <br>
<br>
At least that&#146;s what I heard.  My thoughts were elsewhere at the time.  A light bulb had gone off in my head.  A way to answer the questions that had been bothering me for hours.  <br>
 <br>
Who was Brian Hunter?<br>
<br>
Where does he live?<br>
<br>
What was that smell?<br>
<br>
How does he get his eyes to turn blood red and have his voice reach seemingly inobtainable tones of doom?<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh mom.  The con is lasting longer than I thought it would.  It&#146;s going on for an extra week.  Some of my friends here have space in their rooms where I could stay.  Is it all right if I&#146;m gone another week?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmmm.  I guess.  Just keep in touch, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea mom, love ya, gotta go.  Bye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Click.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey man, the con isn&#146;t going on for another week.  What the hell are you doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyler, I want you to call your mom and tell her what I just told mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because Tyler.  We&#146;re going to go on a little trip.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really, where to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Colorado my boy.  We&#146;re going to find out who Brian Hunter really is.&quot;<br>
