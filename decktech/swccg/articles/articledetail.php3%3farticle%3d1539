This article originally began as a deck submission, but by the time I finished writing the strategy section there was too much tech information in part 1 (Why Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation Rocks) and since this is also (to my knowledge) a fairly new deck idea, I made it into an article. Remember - you saw it here. Don't worry. It's not that long. Actually, it's a little long - but every bit is worth reading. Please make any suggestions to the deck in part 2. I'll post a slightly updated version of the deck as a deck submission in a few days.<br>
<br>
PART 1 ------- Why Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation Rocks -------<br>
<br>
Knowing the exact game text of Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation will be very helpful while reading this. Since this objective isn't popular yet, I'll list its game text right here:<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony (starting side) :<br>
Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 Force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from your Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations.<br>
Flip this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City).<br>
Place out of play if Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
Independent Operation (flip side) :<br>
While this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and independent starships are immune to attrition &lt; 4. At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your independent starships are deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.<br>
Flip this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors).<br>
Place out of play is Bespin is &quot;blown away&quot;.<br>
<br>
At first glance, Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation doesn't seem like tournament level material. First of all, the starting side doesn't allow you to force drain for more than 1 at Cloud City sites. Then, after you finally flip the objective what do you get? A whole bunch of sh*t that has to do with independent starships and cloud cars. Who uses that cr*p? This is a common first impression. Most people look at the objective in a similar manner and then just throw it away. But in this case first impressions don't count.<br>
<br>
The first thing you should notice about Quiet Mining Colony is that it starts off with the Bespin system and any other Cloud City battleground site (which in my deck is Cloud City: Guest Quarters). These are two 2-1 locations for a minimum activation of five on the first turn. Why do people play with Yavin 4: Massassi Throne Room and Careful Planning? Because it lets them activate a minimum of five force on the first turn (and they also get to go first in the game - but hey, you can't have everything). However, a Throne Room start has many complications that Quiet Mining Colony doesn't.<br>
<br>
First of all, a Throne room deck uses up it's starting interrupt to get the extra sites (usually Farm and Swamp) for Force activation. With Quiet Mining Colony, you can still play Heading For The Medical Frigate and get three effects. Furthermore, Quiet Mining Colony is more cost effective - two sites (Bespin and Guest Quarters) for five force versus three sites (Massassi Throne Room and two generic sites) for five force (both scenarios also give your opponent two force). One can argue that Throne Room is better because it allows you to play tricks like Nudj and Revolution. But any good Dark Side player can get around those annoyances - not to mention that there are quite a few cards these days that cancel Revolution (in the end, Nudj and Revolution are a waste of valuable deck space). And again, let's not forget the three starting effects - they can win or lose the game for you.<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony is awesome because it allows you to deploy any site or cloud sector to Bespin for 1 Force. And this isn't the same thing as deploying generic sites with Dantooine Base Operations or Local Uprising - you can actually deploy any unique Cloud City location of your choice. But what's so good about Cloud City? Well, most Cloud City sites are interior. This means that when Insurrection is out on the table, Elis Helrot's piloting license is revoked in Cloud City - sorry, your friends Vader, Tarkin, and Mara won't be able to make any surprise visits if they're on another planet. Does this mean that (since Nabrun Leids also loses his piloting license when Insurrection is out on the table) you can't travel fast anymore? Not at all. There's always public transportation within Cloud City via Lift Tubes that can &quot;react&quot; and have a destiny of six. Or one of your characters can always take a quick shortcut via a Path Of Least Resistance (which can also be used as a mini Cantina shuffle on Cloud City in very close games where one extra Force drain means the game). Futhermore, you won't have any uninvited AT-ATs or AT-STs crashing the party. O, you didn't know that? Yes, every day is a party on Cloud City with a Cloud City Celebration.<br>
<br>
Early in the game, you can deploy the 2-1 Cloud City interior sites (North Corridor and West Gallery only, since Guest Quarters is already deployed and you don't want any AT-ATs at the Casino) for quick force activation. Later in the game, you can deploy the drain sites (Carbonite Chamber and Lower Corridor) when you have the forces to control them. Finally, when your ready to flip, fetch a Bespin: Cloud City (you can even get that since it's a cloud sector) - which brings me to the question: should you play to flip?<br>
<br>
Certainly, I think that all Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation decks should have the ability to flip - but it's not absolutely necessary since you can always go off Cloud City with the awesome force activation provided. Flipping is easy: make sure that Bespin: Cloud City is the last location you deploy before flipping, occupy this sector and thus control it, and then actually flip. If the Dark Side decides to join you on Cloud City don't worry - flipping should still be a piece of cake. Just spread out so that they don't control any site (and you control at least two) and then after you flip, move your characters together so that they don't receive a beatdown (a Lift Tube and/or Path Of Least Resistance can be very helpful in this case). Also, once your objective is flipped make sure to fortify your presence at the Bespin system so that your objective is never flipped back. It is very unlikely that the Dark Side will ever control three Bespin locations - they can only do it if you let them. Choose about four or five - and never more than six Cloud City sites for your deck. Having lots of Cloud City sites out on the table gives the Dark Side a chance to re-flip your objective.<br>
<br>
Flipping the objective provides two major benefits: you can drain on Cloud City for full potential (which is greatly enhanced by Pucumir Thryss), and your drains on Cloud City with an alien (notice it says an alien - that means any alien - none of that non-unique cr*p) cannot be canceled or modified by your opponent. No more -1 drains from the flip side of Ralltiir Operations. And you can even keep your bonuses without fear of Imperial Decree or similar effects. This brings me to my next case: the flexibility and potential of the objective.<br>
<br>
Some of the biggest strengths of Quiet Mining Colony/Independent Operation aren't listed in its game text. These strengths include it's ability to deal with Dark Side cards such as Come Here You Big Coward and Search And Destroy. Why do Ralltiir Operations beat Echo Base Operations? Because of cards like the ones just mentioned (don't forget that EBO also has to use up its starting interrupt for A New Secret Base - if ANSB was an objective, that wouldn't of been awesome... I know I'm getting off the topic here but I have to say this - I did see an EBO deck once that used Heading For The Medical Frigate as its starting effect and then hoped to get The Signal in its opening hand in order to fetch ANSB - this would work very well if the person was very, very, very lucky - because when The Signal didn't show up, the deck collapsed). Quiet Mining Colony gives you battleground locations (remember that except for the outermost marker, Hoth sites are not battlegrounds when Main Power Generators is on the table) that you can occupy right away; you won't have the shield anymore, but this is much better - you can drain and do all that other stuff without leaving your home (Cloud City in this case, as opposed to Hoth).<br>
<br>
What other stuff? Well, Force retrieval for one thing. Quiet Mining Colony doesn't have any of that &quot;your cards at Dagobah may not contribute to Force retrieval&quot; cr*p that Mind What You Have Learned does (I really think that MWYHL would be the number one deck if it wasn't for that one stupid sentence) - you can freely use your favorite method of force retrieval (On The Edge, Off The Edge, etc - and don't forget Cloud City Celebration) on Cloud City. Secret Plans should never be a problem since QMC provides the awesome Force activation. Also, are your opponent's Force drain bonuses eating up your deck? Not to worry, QMC provides the tools to easily set up Menace Fades (Bespin system and any Cloud City battleground site - this also stops Battle Order).<br>
<br>
Well, nothing comes free - even Quiet Mining Colony has a small drawback. Before you flip, your Force drains on Cloud City are limited to 1 per location. However, this should not be much of a problem. You can't regularly drain for more than 1 at any of the 2-1 sites (Guest Quarters, North Corridor, and West Gallery) anyway, and by the time Pucumir Thryss and the drain sites (Carbonite Chamber and Lower Corridor) come out, you should be ready to flip (as discussed above). Of course if you feel up to it, you can always chuck Pucumir and the drain sites and then go fight off Cloud City (in which case flipping is not necessary) - don't worry, the Guest Quarters and the West Gallery both have a nice game text of &quot;Force drain -1 here&quot; for your opponent to enjoy (and if you can control the North Corridor, you can use 1 Force to cancel any Force drain on Cloud City).<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony is sort of like a Set Your Course For Alderaan for Light Side - only better. Why don't people see this yet? It's very flexible and interactive (which means it's also fun to play but it might not be for beginners). If played right, it shouldn't have any weaknesses against any Dark Side decks - but it can go either way depending on how good each player is against a SYCFA deck with lots of different (20+) characters. QMC provides all the necessary tools to make a winning deck (awesome Force activation, favorable battlegrounds, Force retrieval options, easy flip, protection of your Force drains once flipped, etc - all as discussed above).<br>

PART 3 ------- How To Play The Deck -------<br>
<br>
I suggest that your starting Cloud City battleground site is the Guest Quarters since Leia deploys -2 there. This game text might prove very useful on your first turn if your opponent is playing some kind of a drop and drain deck or a manipulator. Heading For The Medical Frigate should be used to pull Squadron Assignments (yes, there are only two different ships in this deck that can be used with this effect - but it still makes a big difference when the ships are Artoo-Detoo In Red 5 and the Millennium Falcon) and any other two effects as appropriate. I usually like to have some Sense and Alter protection, so one of the other two effects is usually a Wise Advice (which also allows you to deploy What're You Tryin' To Push On Us? for free as a surprise) - but Do, Or Do Not also works as well. Insurrection is also a favorite. However, these two effects can and if necessary should be changed depending on what your opponent is playing. For example, if you're playing against Bring Him Before Me, deploy Your Insight Serves You Well and then lose it to fetch Honor Of The Jedi - but don't forget to occupy a battleground first (that's another reason why EBO and MWYHL decks lose to BHBM - they have a hard time occupying a battleground if one is not provided by the Dark Side and then their HOTJ gets canceled by an Alter; this doesn't happen with Quiet Mining Colony).<br>
<br>
On your first turn, use 1 Force to search your Reserve Deck for one of the Force activation sites (North Corridor or West Gallery - I usually take the West Gallery). If you have any of these sites in your hand deploy them now, but try to hold on to any Force drain sites (Carbonite Chamber and Lower Corridor) until at least your third turn. Also, deploy any appropriate effects you might have in you hand and then cycle any appropriate cards. Finally, draw some cards - never deploy on your first turn unless there's a very good reason to do so (as mentioned above).<br>
<br>
On your second turn, take out the last Force activation site (which is usually the North Corridor - however if it's in your Force pile, then get the Carbonite Chamber - but try to never deploy the Lower Corridor until your third or fourth turn since that is strictly a Force drain site). Depending on the cards in your hand, you should be thinking what you're going to deploy at this point. You have to make your presence felt at two locations in order to flip the objective: at the Bespin system and at a Cloud City battleground site (I recommend the North Corridor since it allows you to cancel any other Force drain on Cloud City for 1 Force - and this could be very useful if Dark Side has a Downtown Plaza; furthermore, the other two activation sites have the &quot;Force drain -1 here&quot; for your opponent).<br>
<br>
On the third turn, take out a Force drain site (usually the Carbonite Chamber since the Lower Corridor gives your opponent two force) and start getting ready to battle. By the fourth turn at the earliest and the sixth turn at the latest, you should be ready to flip Quiet Mining Colony if you have decided to stay on Cloud City. When you're ready, deploy Bespin: Cloud City, occupy and thus control it, control two CC sites and make sure your opponent doesn't control any (use Lift Tubes and/or Path Of Least Resistance to help you), and then actually flip the objective (also, set up Cloud City Celebration if you have it at this time). Then if you had to spread out on CC to flip, move your characters together in order to avoid a beatdown. Finally, move your starfighter from Bespin: Cloud City to the Bespin system to back up your fleet (unless the backup is not needed and you aren't expecting any bounty hunter ship beatdowns). Flipping QMC has also been described in part 1 of this article.<br>
<br>
If everything went as planned, you should have a scenario set up where you are Force draining with the aid of Pucumir Thryss and one or two other aliens (since Independent Operation says that your Force drains cannot be canceled or modified by the opponent at Bespin locations where you have an alien). You should also be getting back a few cards each turn with Cloud City Celebration. Battle Order, Come Here You Big Coward, Search And Destroy, Secret Plans, and other similar effects should be a waste of deck space for your opponent.<br>
<br>
Now if you feel like battling off Cloud City you're more than welcome to do so. The awesome Force activation will allow you to go to your opponent's sites and take them over. Or you can just make EPP suicide runs with Obi and Leia (Han and Luke will usually be busy elsewhere, but on some occassions even they can come along). You can also fight in space at systems other than Bespin, but your hold on Bespin is crucial - that's why I haven't included any other systems in the deck (don't forget that Bespin has the wonderful game text &quot;if you control, opponent's characters and vehicles deploy +1 to Cloud City locations&quot;).<br>
<br>
Now a look at this deck versus some popular Dark Side decks:<br>
 - against SYCFA non-flip - a fun match. The better player will win. It can go either way. Be very patient and deploy in numbers. Lift Tubes and Paths Of Least Resistance during battles on Cloud City can mean the game. If you successfully set up a Cloud City Celebration and they have few or no methods of Force retrieval, you should always win.<br>
- against SYCFA flip - the objective won't let them blow up Bespin. Set up your Force drains on Cloud City and hold out Bespin at all costs when the star destroyers come out. Try to set up the Defiance + Heavy Turbolaser Battery combo to blow them out of the sky (with two tracked destinies you can even take you an Executor).<br>
- against Bring Him Before Me - start with Your Insight Serves You Well and lose it to get Honor Of The Jedi - but not before you occupy a battleground (you don't want the Emperor to Alter it, do you ?). Don't deploy Luke until they deploy Vader. Once Vader is out, use Lift Tubes and Paths Of Least Resistance to keep Luke away from Vader for the entire game at Cloud City interior sites (provided you also start with Insurrection to stop Elis Helrot). Chose your battles wisely since they will always get an extra battle destiny from the Emperor's Power. Track destiny to hit their stuff with weapons.<br>
- against Ralltiir Operations - they won't be able to affect your drains once you flip your objective. You will be activating a lot more Force than them - use that to your advantage. Consider taking a trip to the Ralltiir system in order to stop them from flipping. If they flip, you can always have an old fashioned drain race - but watch out; since they can get any card out of their Reserve Deck, they will eventually come to Cloud City. Your other option is using Romas &quot;Lock&quot; Navander to attack their weakest site.<br>
- against Court Scum - don't go to the Audience Chamber. This is why Profit doesn't do as well as it should in tourneys. Set up on CC (your usual flip - drain - retrieve) and let them have their small drains on Tatooine. Only attack them if they spread out too much.<br>
- against Endor Ops - use standard procedure of flip - drain -	retrieve. An drain race is likely. Try to cancel Establish Secret Base.<br>
- againts Hunt Down - most people who used to play this are switching to BHBM. Use the same strategy with Honor Of The Jedi. Then flip - drain - retrieve. You can battle more freely against this than BHBM.<br>
- against ISB - cancel their bonuses with the Menace Fades. With flip side of QMC, use aliens to stop the -1 Force drain modifier. Kill ISB agents here and there. Also the usual flip - drain - retrieve.<br>
- against Ops - this is dead. It would be a surprise to see it - but if it shows up start with the Menace Fades and then flip - drain - retrieve.<br>
<br>
PART 4 ------- Final Thoughts -------<br>
<br>
I will use this deck at the next tournament I go to and see how well it does. I believe that it has a very high potential that is only matched by Profit in terms of balance. I must honestly say that I could have picked a better character base with more non-EPP mains and their weapons. But I usually don't play with a character base of mains and toys - EPPs is what I'm used to. I usually played EBO, and before EBO I played Hidden Base - get the picture? Experts should customize the character base to their own liking. That's what makes the deck balanced - it doesn't rely on a specific strategy to win and if one small thing doesn't work out it won't collapse.<br>

At this point I was going to add another section with cards to consider, playing the meta, etc. (common sense stuff for experts). However, I think that this article is long enough and I don't want to make it any longer (I'm sure you don't either). Please rate this (and don't take off anything because it's long - lol). I'm interested in the reason if you give this less than a five. Please give me any suggestions for the deck. Thanx. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1539"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1539"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1539" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
