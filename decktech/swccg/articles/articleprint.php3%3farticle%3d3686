Well today I was thinking, “ oh crap, my regional is only three weeks away!”. So I (finally) started looking at what my meta was like in the Endor region. Lightsaber combat is seeing quite a few tournament reports as is senate/TIEs for the dark side and Hunt Down Combat hybrids. Light side is posting QMC, RST, Combat, and a hundred other oddball decks. So I tell myself there is no clear choice here. I wish I could see the future and find out who’s going to win. I’d put up a hefty bet and get some bills paid off. Anyway, I thought a little more around those lines then something popped into my head, It Is The Future You See. Hmmm… Jedi Testing? No, too slow. Combat would kill me right? Or would it. I started to tinker with the deck a few months ago, but didn’t have the guts until my last local tournament to debut my thoughts as I brought MWYHL to the game. I had the flu and played terribly, I wanted to blame it on the deck at first and scrap the whole concept, but a conversation I’d had with Ryan French during the tournament sunk in. He was telling me about a training deck his brother Mike had been beating him with for the last few weeks. It used some teched up cards to draw out shields and induce some pain along the way. Sometimes taking and crossing Vader for fun after training to 5. Then I really started digging into the thought that MWYHL would be the deck to try to kill Combat with. I looked at some of the other decks on Decktech and didn’t find any decks that I really thought were amazing, until Mike French finally posted his. Lights came on in my head immediately as I saw what it was that I had been looking for. Although our decks were very similar his had some items that pushed it to the forefront (in my mind) of design. Yoda Stew, one of the most broken cards in the game for the light side saturated the deck. That one card seemed to me to be so obvious, why didn’t I think of that? I tweaked my character mix and trained Leia instead of Luke. Why the hell I trained him instead of her to begin with I will NEVER know. Thoughts of Leia packing her blaster rifle wearing Mercenary Armor made me drool. The one shot Walker killer was born in my mind at that moment. I built the deck and started play testing it. Right from the start I could see the advantages of Yoda Stew, one in the draw let me drop DOS, Yoda, Yoda’s Hope, Luke’s Backpack, Training Area, and Great Warrior my first turn. This continued and I found test 5 usually completed by turn 8, after I tracked a good 7. This was good, but I still wasn’t convinced. I built a dark combat deck next to test it against. From the first turn I realized something, if I didn’t get that perfect start in the beginning I was still going to lose too much force early on to be able to really mount much of an offensive later on. I played 18 different games versus this combat deck, and won only 7 times. And even then the largest differential was 12. I concluded that MWYHL might be a good deck to play with, just not for me.<br>
<br>
So it was time to go back to the drawing board. I scrapped what I had and went back to the cards to take another look at all of my objectives. I really wanted to avoid playing another combat deck, even though my trademark deck (Voice Of The Council) was doing very well (51-1 in combined casual and tournament play) I really wanted to do something different. I remembered a deck that I had taken first place with a few months back at one of my local tournaments, TIGIH scouts. It served up a hefty beat down to all who tried to walk on Endor. I had a pretty cool series of card combos that let my scouts run around blasting anything that moved and forfeiting their weapons to the used pile to cover all the attrition and pull them back out again the next turn. Every time a scout fired one of the blasters it was at either +3 or +6 by the time I played Blaster Proficiency. I could take out Walkers with ease. Then I could up my battle destiny draws by +6 as well. So I began toying with this deck as well. I built a few things to test it against and quickly discovered yet another flaw brought out by current meta. Hunt Down Combat variants had way too high destiny for me to effectively deal with. And Maul dropped down a few times to take Luke off of the table too easily. Then he’d battle, hit 2 of my scouts, and play Ghhk and forfeit Maul. As this happened twice more I had too little of an offensive force left to oppose him and was drained out. It ended being a full loss by almost 30. Only a couple of games like this were enough to let me know that I needed to go another route. In the current environment my scouts just weren’t up to the challenge. <br>
<br>
Out of desperation I started looking at my combat deck again. I was wondering what it would need to make it into a serious competitor. Well the one thing that it has never had is any space package. So I figured Han, Chewie, &amp; The Falcon was a good start. But then I tinkered with it some more. Finally I had so many counter cards in the deck is was no longer the machine that it used to be. I started play testing it non-the-less and discovered that my old differential scores were now gone. The deck seemed to have lost its edge and it was harder than ever to win with. Not sure if that’s because I’m so used to the deck that I know exactly how to beat it or if the more current versions of other decks like Court, Dark LC, Senate TIEs, Hunt Down Hybrid, MKOS had anything to do with it. I did come out of it with one of my best dark deck ever though. For that I ended up using my Dark Combat Hybrid deck. It very effectively shut down light Jedi-mains and Toys. It also had enough power to control some space locations and handle big beat downs. Not to mention deal them out itself. And the drain potential of Combat is legendary. So having decided on my dark deck still hadn’t made things any easier to build a solid light side one. I was right back to square one.<br>
<br>
I tried some seriously questionable decks too. I tried a gungan pile deck, an Asteroid Sanctuary deck with a Local uprising false start. I tried some really whacked crap out of desperation. I think that I tried every deck that I could ever remember. Even some piles and EBO. Well it came down to what am I familiar with and what is comfortable. For that You’ll have to read my tournament report from the up coming June 8th Endor regional. Until then I’ll leave you with some of the decks that I tested and built. <br>
