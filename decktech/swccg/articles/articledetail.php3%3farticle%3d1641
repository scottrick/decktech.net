It's one of the most versatile, powerful personas in the game.	I'm not talking about Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker here, I'm talking about Wedge Antilles, one of the most frequently used cards in the game.  Ever since A New Hope came out, my Light Side decks have almost always been only 59 cards; the last slot was for Wedge.  This article will take a detailed look at each of the Wedge personas, their strengths and weaknesses, and the decks that they work best in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wedge Antilles - ANH<br>
Destiny 4, Deploy 2, Forfeit 6<br>
Power 2, Ability 2<br>
Pilot, Warrior, Smuggler<br>
Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots.	When piloting Red 2, also adds 2 to manuever and draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise.  May use 1 Force to take one Corellian Slip into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.<br>
<br>
What better place to start than the beginning?	The first version of Wedge appeared in the A New Hope expansion, and immediately found a place in nearly every Light Side deck.  He was arguably the best pilot in the game at the time, combining an extremely good deploy/forfeit ratio with a power bonus of 3 to whatever he flew and the ability to pull Corellian Slips for 1 Force each, helping to combat Tallon Rolls.  Beyond the obvious, however, he had an insanely high destiny of 4 and smuggler skill, allowing him to make Kessel Runs.  As the years have progressed and new sets have come out, this version has continued to be one of the most played cards in the game.  Hoth introduced EBO, a perfect deck for the low deploy pilots like Wedge and one of the first viable space decks for the Light Side.  Dagobah brought numbers to the scene...but Wedge's destiny of 4 was perfect for fighting (or running) an odds deck.  Despite all the changes to the game, ANH Wedge is still extraordinarily useful and finds its way into many decks.  His ability of 2 makes him a total stud if Insurrection hits the table, boosting his forfeit to 8.  Mantellian Savrip, anyone?  Bacta Tank has been around forever, and combined with Redemption has been used for years to forfeit Wedge (who can satisfy most if not all damage/attrition from the average battle, especially now with Insurrection) and recycle him back into play for only 2 Force.  Squadron Assignments lets him fly his own ship (Red 2 or Red Squadron 1), although RS1 is by far the better choice.  Still, ANH Wedge's power lies in his versatility.	He's perfect in a balanced deck since he's cheap and effective both on land and in space, and a space odds deck (like the HB Numbers decks that have been popular off and on for a while) can always use a high destiny character with some punch.  He's a great target for Noble Sacrifice; retrieve 6-8 Force when your opponent drops Evax or Chiraneau without losing a huge character.	There are some downsides to the original Wedge, of course.  His low power and ability means that he isn't a one man wrecking crew like some of the mains, so some people shy away from this version in favor of higher power/ability but less efficient cards like Bron Burs or BoShek in ground beatdown decks.  His smuggler skill can sometimes be a liability, such as when Death Mark hits the table.  His low ability can also hurt him when he's on the ground.  He is a prime target for Tramples, Gravel Storms, and weapons...that huge forfeit doesn't do much good if he's dead, captured, or his forfeit is reduced to nothing.  His smuggler skill can occaisionally protect him from this, however; Keep Your Eyes open can cancel a battle outright if he's with another smuggler.  As Good As Gone can save your ass if Wedge survives a really big loss, allowing you to redeploy him where he WON'T get pummeled.  I've also heard a couple people talking about how their Wedge got eaten but a COTVG deck's Sarlacc...this is extremely unlikely, but it does occaisionally happen, and the last thing you want is an Insurrectioned Wedge Antilles to get chomped...ouch!  Still, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.	This is the ultimate in versatility; if you aren't sure what character to add to your deck, it's pretty safe to say that Wedge Antilles would help you unless you have a really strange theme or don't use many characters in the first place.  He works best in beatdown decks, whether they be ground or space, due to his ability to soak up a LOT of damage and deploy cheaply, but he fits into most any strategy quite well and is the most versatile of the Wedge personas so far, making him my pick for the #1 Wedge at this point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commander Wedge Antilles - SE<br>
Destiny 3, Deploy 3, Forfeit 6<br>
Power 3, Ability 2<br>
Pilot, Warrior, Leader<br>
Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots.	When piloting Rogue 3, also adds 2 to manuever and draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise.  May use 2 Force to take one One More Pass into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.<br>
<br>
The second version of Wedge was a long time in coming, appearing two years after the Hoth expansion brought us a very lonely Rogue 3.  His power was upped to 3, as was his deploy, and his destiny was lowered to a 3.  He traded in his smuggler skill for leader skill, and instead of searching for Corellian Slips he grabs One More Pass.  Although this Wedge is in some cases a better choice that the original, it is far less useful overall.  His piloting skills are still excellent, but his matching ship is Rogue 3 which is not as good in most decks and can't be deployed with Squadron Assignments.  His higher power is great for ground decks, and he can still reap the benefits of Insurrection, but between the added deploy cost and the lower destiny, he just isn't the bargain ANH Wedge was.  He has some very distinct advantages over the other Wedges, however.  As a leader of ability &lt; 2, Princess Organa can deploy him from your Reserve Deck.  Jedi Presence and Commander Wedge go quite well together; 3 Force for power 6, forfeit 6-8 is pretty damn good.  Leader skill is usually more useful than smuggler skill, although there are still cards that target it (Responsibility Of Command, Stunning Leader, etc.).  He can no longer make a Kessel Run, but SE also introduced RFC's so that wasn't a huge deal.  Echo Base Garrison lets you take Commander Wedge into your hand from Reserve, so EBO decks that run EBG and RTP decks that start the effect may find Commander Wedge to be a better alternative to the original.  Unfortunately, he still has a giant target on his back due to his low ability, and his higher power makes him an even juicier target than the original Wedge was.  His strengths lie in ground beatdown decks, especially those that use Insurrection and/or Jedi Presence to increase damage while minimizing their own...he's not as good a fall guy as ANH Wedge is when combined with a Bacta Tank, but Ben Kenobi/Jedi Presence + Commander Wedge is deadly even without Insurrection and Savrip still works just as well.  If you plan on space, this is most likely the worst choice for you unless SE Leia and/or EBG are in your deck as well, and Commander Wedge doesn't work too well with numbers (oh well, I'm not a big fan of numbers anyway :) so once again, ANH Wedge is the better choice in that case.  Commander Wedge is a great card, but the other versions are so much better that he isn't used as much, making him the #3 Wedge persona.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader - ANH<br>
Destiny 2, Deploy 3, Forfeit 6<br>
Power 3, Ability 3<br>
Pilot, Warrior, Leader<br>
Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots.	When piloting, draws one battle destiny if not able to otherwise (if Red 2, also adds 2 to maneuver).  When in battle with another Red or Rogue Squadron pilot, once per battle may canel one battle destiny just drawn.<br>
<br>
Wedge Antilles, RSL (aka Grand Moff Wedge) is the newest incarnation of our favorite Rebel pilot.  Once again, the destiny has been lowered to a still respectable 2, while his power and ability are both 3.  His forfeit is still 6...and it isn't going anywhere, Insurrection no longer works on him.  You also won't be able to pull the Princess Organa trick with him due to his ability of 3.  One look at his game text, however, and his power becomes clear.  Grand Moff Wedge is INCREDIBLY powerful in a space deck with Squadron Assignments.  Stick him on Red Squadron 1 and you have power 6, maneuver 6, hyperspeed 5 for 3-4 Force, plus immunity to attrition &lt; 5 and virtual immunity to Tallon Rolls, and unlike the original Red 2 you don't need an astromech character...bonus!	As is that weren't enough, he draws a battle destiny in space...period.  Grand Moff Wedge laughs off ability 6 for destiny requirements, whether he's on his own ship or taking the Spiral for a spin.  Hey, stick him on Independance and kick the immunity up a notch.  Or even better, have Farmboy Luke on Artoo-Detoo In Red 5 and Grand Moff Wedge on RS1 garrison your system of choice.  The pair is immune to ZIMH, power 14 for only 11 Force, and your opponent better have multiple battle destinies, cause otherwise he isn't gonna scratch you.  Even WITH multiple destinies, he'll need a 5 to crack your immunity.  Great googily-moogily.  Throw in the Super Falcon, Tycho + GS3, and some capitals (preferably with more Red/Rogue squad pilots to capitalize on Wedge's ability) and you have the space fleet from hell.  If you use Squadron Assignments, this is the best Wedge for you.  It's as simple as that.	He's an absolute monster.  He's not too bad on the ground, either, and with Tycho or Biggs he can still cancel battle destinies.  One word of caution; Wedge is NOT the same as Tarkin, he can only cancel BATTLE destinies.	Of course, he can also cancel one of yours, which Tarkin can't do.  This may sound stupid, but I've gotten out of tight situations by attacking a couple of characters on my turn just to lose my characters and prevent a beatdown the next turn...with Grand Moff Wedge, however, you can actually cancel your own destiny to prevent your opponent from forfeiting his way out of trouble.  Not a likely situation, but it's an interesting use for a great ability and it goes with the theme of Wedge Antilles in the SWCCG universe; versatility.  Like Commander Wedge, he's strong in ground decks that need big characters or use Jedi Presence, but his forfeit is lower due to the lack of Insurrection compatability.  His ability of 3 can come in handy, making it easier to draw destiny and, when he's on the ground, making him a bit tougher to take out with weapons/Tramples etc. than his earlier counterparts.  Also, he adds to the retrieval for Our Most Desperate Hour.	Again, not something every deck will benefit from, but it's good to know.  He's immune to Bad Feeling Have I, and since the Dark Side has no &quot;Goo Nee Tay&quot; his ability is not really a drawback, with the exception of Insurrection.  You can even use some more obscure cards, like Moving To Attack Position, to help out the Corellian commander.  Wedge Antilles, RSL can basically be summed up like this; if you want to use Squadron Assignments, he's your man.  In just about any other situation, it's a toss up between him and the ANH version, although in most cases I'd go with the original Wedge due to the lower deploy, Insurrection effect, and insanely good destiny.  Still, the D*II Wedge is a strong persona and easily the #2 version behind the original.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hopefully after reading this, you'll have learned something about one of the best personas in the game.  No, he'll never be a Darth Vader, and he isn't even an automatic choice for every Light deck anymore, but Wedge is still one of the few non-main characters that appears in nearly every deck.  I'm sure there are things that I have missed or not mentioned, since the possible uses and combos for the card are endless and his lack of deployment restrictions allows him to fight just about anywhere he wants; I just can't mention everything in one article!  I hope you've enjoyed this look at the various versions of Wedge and their abilities and drawbacks. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1641"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1641"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1641" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
