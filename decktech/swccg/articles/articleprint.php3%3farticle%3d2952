Then a week later Decipher comes out with an erratum that specifically ends your fun. Does this sound all too familiar? If so the best recommendation is this, deal with it. This is Deciphers way of fixing an uneven play environment otherwise known as the “Magic Bullet” approach. If you look at other games like Magic, Dragonball Z, or Pokemon they continually re-write the entire set of rules. Magic re-invented themselves, copied the stack from Star Wars, but did not get it right either. Pokemon’s approach is a little different, they look at the cards that they have available and at the play environment created in Japan and try to guess at what the American play environment will be like. In addition, doing so they try to edit the card text accordingly. Dragonball Z’s approach is to re-invent themselves after a few expansions, thus changing the way the game plays entirely.<br>
<br>
Upon looking at it, I would say that the Decipher approach is thus far more appealing to me. If the erratum does not work, then its time to “load the gun with silver bullets”. Some excellent examples in recent expansions are the Defensive Shields from reflections III. This is Deciphers latest and best attempt at leveling the meta game and focusing the content of a player’s deck. To this end they hope to avoid the endless amounts of counter cards required to stay competitive in the current environment. We now have a good variety of defenses to ward off some of the most abusive deck types around. We can neuter the effects of a flipped Watch Your Step, reduce the damage from a non-interactive Dagobah cheese Podracing deck, and so forth. Deciphers latest card choice is an excellent idea. One would only ask one question though, why did they wait so long to come out with them? Were they waiting for that spiffy little Gungan energy shield icon?<br>
<br>
I think that I will change the focus of the rest of the article toward an overview of possible deck types to become dominant in the new environment created by reflections III. First lets look at what will become obsolete. The first thing that comes to mind is Scum for the dark side. It has taken some major hits in recent expansions. The first nail in its coffin was Tatooine Qui-Gon Jinn. His built in alien hosing game text rocked Jabba’s Palace to its foundations. Follow this up with a jedi’s focus and you have some nasty anti-alien cards in the game. Then there was The Camp. All in the same set! The reflections III set saw the ultimate insult to the alien world though… Leia, Rebel Princess. She is the Darth Maul for the light side where aliens are concerned. Drop her down and deploy Yoda’s Gimmer Stick and Mercenary Armor on her and she becomes “very powerful indeed.” With the ability to deploy Anakin’s Lightsaber on her as well, she is as good as any jedi out there today. Other than the usual unplayable light side objectives I do not see anything new dying for them though. <br>
<br>
So now, I will get on to the possible strong decks to come out of the new environment. The obvious nod will go to the new objectives from R3. They prevent the opponent from blocking your drains. They provide enough punch to keep your opponent on the constant defensive approach to his game. They are forced to react to what you are doing and are generally unable to concentrate on their own deck strategy. This in any game is a huge advantage, because your opponent does not know what your decks built to do. Even though this deck is very strong, it does have some very exploitable weaknesses. One is the light sides inability to battle or duel when flipped. It can’t auto kill an ability &lt; 5 character if they are flipped either. The dark side just has to drop EPP Vader and Dr. Evazan down and battle. If they hit Dr. E in the generator core he goes to the used pile. Not very effective in ridding the table of threats for long. <br>
<br>
The dark side on the other hand gets something that they have needed for a long time. A viable alternative to Hunt Down. This deck is going to surprise people when it is built correctly. It must remember to utilize support characters and strategies in addition to the Lightsaber combat objectives already strong capabilities. Young Fool is excellent in this deck. Some very essential cards for both of these two decks are lots of SAC. Control of the table and interrupt control is catastrophic to opponents.<br>
<br>
The only real question remaining for me is this, what new objectives will we see for Theed Palace? With so many possible new themes which will make it to a card? Will it be the final battle between the Battle Droid armies and the Gungan armies? The Climatic space battle between the forces of the Naboo and the trade federation? Or will we see both of these in the set? Any thing that adds to the limited power of the current episode I objectives from Tatooine has to be an improvement.<br>
