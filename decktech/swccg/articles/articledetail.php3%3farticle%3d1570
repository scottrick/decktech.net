Everything was just getting wound up, the turnouts were growing, sanctioned prizes were arriving and some of the first ratings were appearing on the web and my players were right there. Little did I know that the players, the people I was meeting at this time would shape my life in ways I could never possibly imagine.<br>
  Sanctioned play had just begun. Prize support in those days was Black Border starter decks of all things but it worked out because my turnouts were still hovering around 10 to 15 and the store that was hosting the tournaments was kicking in boosters to add to the prizes. People soon realized that they were getting way more than their money's worth at tournaments and were having a blast doing it. When the ratings system started the players were very excited about it and it was one more draw to bring new players in who were considering giving tournament play a shot. Everyone wanted that little bit of fame.<br>
  One such player was a guy named Shawn Valdez. He was a 13 year old kid who liked video games and had been introduced to the game by a friend in the neighborhood. Shawn came to one of my very first sanctioned tournaments, looking for that little piece of immortality.<br>
  He needed it a lot more than most of the other players but we didn't know it at the time. Shawn's time was almost up and within 24 hours of playing in that tournament he would be dead. Killed by the leukemia he had fought since he was 6 years old. Seven years of borrowed time were almost up but he was going to make a mark somehow.<br>
  I doubt he knew the mark he left would grow so big. That it would encompass so many people, bringing them together in common cause in a way that nobody could ever have predicted.<br>
  But that was all in the future on that Saturday, August 31st 1996. I knew nothing of Shawn's illness, though it was obvious he was not well. He put his head on his arms after each game and did not really chat with the other kids, this was all taxing for him. I asked him at one point a little worriedly if he was okay, he had big dark circles  under his eyes and his skin was literally green. He assured me he was fine and told me he had stayed up all night working on his decks.<br>
  When Pizza came he did not want any and asked could he have a coke instead.  I said sure and he asked to use the phone. The second game did not go well for him either, he lost and once again he sat with his head in his arms. His Brother arrived to pick him up soon thereafter and he told me he was feeling too crappy to continue. I told him no problem and gave him a starter deck and a booster and thanked him for coming and told him I was sorry he had not done better.<br>
  &quot;That's okay&quot; he said  &quot;I just really wanted to play&quot;<br>
   I can remember watching him as he left and getting this strange feeling, a knowledge that there was something really wrong with him. I can be a little too imaginative sometimes though so I chalked it up to that and within seconds somebody was yelling for a ruling so I forgot about it.<br>
  The following Thursday I got a phone call from Trina Cooper, the manager of the comic store. She was upset, crying a little and she told me that Shawn Valdez was dead. I couldn't believe it. She told me more about it and that he had died the day after the tournament and I was stunned. I was in shock I think for the first minute or so and then it all seemed to just crash in on me and I was practically screaming and crying so hard I could barely speak. There was just no way that could be true, it was only a few days ago and he was alive and playing cards. Trina gave me the number of a family friend and I called her and she told me more about Shawn and the leukemia and all the amazing things he did in his short life.<br>
  I realized that I had had a brush with the bravest person I had ever met and never even realized it. That's the way he wanted it, I was assured. He did not want to be treated differently but he always was because everyone must have always looked at him like he was already dead, the disease he had was not supposed to let him live as long as he had but miracle after miracle had gotten him through. But on September 1st 1996, Shawn ran out of miracles.<br>
  But there was one miracle more left in his bag of tricks.<br>
  I simply could not let this go, it hurt me too much and I had to do something. The injustice of it pretty much ruined me and I almost didn't want to do tournaments any more. I kept looking at the kids and wondering, will he be here next week. It gave me a sense of mortality like nothing I had experienced before and a deeper appreciation of the gifts I have.<br>
  I wrote a very heartfelt post to the Star Wars CCG Listserv. Here is the original text, sorry if some of it is redundant after seeing the story but it's important in that it set a lot of things in motion and was written when the wound was still really raw:<br>

On Sat, 7 Sep 1996 TedSallis@aol.com wrote:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;   Few of you are likely to remember my tournament report from last week but I<br>
&gt; wanted to update everyone here on what has transpired in the week since then.<br>
&gt; You might remember me mentioning one of our players, a guy named Shawn<br>
&gt; Valdez, who was too sick to finish the tournament Saturday and quit after two<br>
&gt; games. Well, come to find out that Shawn was a lot sicker than any of us<br>
&gt; knew. He died of leukemia on Sunday.<br>
&gt;	Shawn was an incredibly brave kid who led an unbelievable life. He had a<br>
&gt; published book of poetry and went to New York City to do signings. He worked<br>
&gt; for a video game company testing games, telling them what was cool and what<br>
&gt; sucked as only a kid can. And I am told that Star Wars was his absolute<br>
&gt; favorite thing in the whole world, he lived and breathed it. He really liked<br>
&gt; the card game and played really hard. He didn't win often but it didn't<br>
&gt; matter to him. Just playing was enough.<br>
&gt;   He was so sick Saturday. So pale and weak and just plain miserable that I<br>
&gt; felt really sorry for him, even though at the time I had no idea how ill he<br>
&gt; really was. I never thought I'd lose one of my little rebels, it's all just<br>
&gt; fun and games and when your force is depleted you just shuffle and go again.<br>
&gt; Shawn won't get to try again. Shawn won't ever see a Hoth expansion card or<br>
&gt; sit down at a theater to watch the Special Edition. He'll never find a Greedo<br>
&gt; figure at Toys R Us. He'll never take a girl to the prom, or marry that girl<br>
&gt; or have a family and kids of his own. 13 years is all he got and he did what<br>
&gt; he could with it. To me it was not enough and it rips me apart. I can't stop<br>
&gt; thinking about it. I can't believe that someone with so little time would<br>
&gt; spend it with us. I think he knew how little time he had and chose to spend<br>
&gt; it there. I hope we were able to make those hours better for him.<br>
&gt;   The last time I saw Shawn he was leaving with his brother and I gave him a<br>
&gt; starter deck and a booster and thanked him for coming out to play.<br>
&gt;   &quot;I'm sorry you didn't do better Shawn.&quot; I said<br>
&gt;   &quot;It's okay&quot; he said &quot;I really just wanted to play&quot;<br>
&gt;   Those words will haunt me for a long time. I'm humbled by the bravery and<br>
&gt; the spirit carried in these few words. And if there is any justice in<br>
&gt; universe, somewhere out there in a galaxy far far away Yoda and Ben and<br>
&gt; Anakin Skywalker are meeting a young Jedi named Shawn Valdez.<br>
&gt;   May the force be with you all.<br>

It still hurts me to read this. But it set in motion so many wonderful things that it's worth it, it's almost worth it to hurt that much. It's almost worth it to feel so bad to feel so good.<br>
  I'd like to leave off here gentle reader. It's a hard place to end a chapter but the story has a happy ending and I'm betting a great many of you were part of that. But I want to leave off and keep the desolate mood of this chapter intact so that the happy part will be untouched by this black chapter.<br>
