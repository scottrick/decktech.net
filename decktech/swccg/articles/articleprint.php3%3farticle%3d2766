But really, all you need to play the game are two 60 card decks, one Dark Side and the other Light Side, and another player to play against. That?s all you need to get the key to the game!<br>
<br>
	If you&#146;re just getting in to the Star Wars CCG the best start is to buy the Death Star II  Starter boxes, the Light and Dark, hey, you have your first mains - General Solo An Chewbacca of Kasyyyk. If this is seemingly not enough, get a Special Edition Starter Deck from eitheir side to assist your Endor and space assualt. Both deck boxes<br>
come with a rules booklet, DSII is more updated so ignore the Special Edition One. Read the rules carefully. Read them around three times then review what you don?t understand,<br>
and there are some things that all of us didn?t understand at first, for me it was attrion and the immunity to it. So I got a Dictionary and found out the definitions then I slowly began to understand it. Test what you?ve learned and your decks against a fellow player, hopefully an experienced one. Bring your DSII rulebook with you, it?s always best to keep the rules nearby.<br>
<br>
	Here?s what stays the same throughout every game. This is quoted from Decipher?s Website:<br>
<br>
	?Every player begins every game of Star Wars CCG with 60 cards in their deck, the usual and tournament legal limit. The 60 cards are each player&#146;s &quot;Life Force.&quot; With<br>
more than a thousand cards to choose from, you might think building a deck of 60 cards is tough, but there are guidelines to aid your choices.?<br>
<br>
First, choose what your deck will do. You may what to base it around a specific part of the movies you liked, say Carbon Freezing or Blowing Up Alderaan with the Death Star,<br>
there are cards that do things like that, called Objectives. You&#146;ll find many examples of decks using Objectives here on Decktech and at Decipher? Deck Collection, which is less<br>
than Decktech?s Collection (DECKTECH ROCKS!). If you are playing Dark Side Lets say you  like blowing up Alderaan. A number of cards are now useless to this design, because they are based around other decks. A Bounty Hunter-like deck wouldn?t help you blow up Alderaan, so you can take away a strategy like that away from your deck. It?s probably best you go the Decipher?s website and look at specific cards you want for your deck, don?t go crazy, you?re not getting Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight your first week. (Unless you?re lucky or able to buy it from somewhere.) Whatever you choose to do determines what cards you need, so for Blowing up Alderaan, you?ll want the Death Star and Set Your Course For Alderaan. Analyze what cards you have and look for ones that make your deck stronger.<br>
<br>
	Balance of cards is also important. If your deck has too many locations you won&#146;t be getting many high destiny draws, so shooting a character and hitting him (or her, but I always stuck to it?s never proper to hit a girl). Neitheir should you throw in all high destiny cards, most main characters are destiny 1 for a reason, it?s a disadvantage.<br>
As stated in the afore mentioned Decipher?s website: <br>
<br>
	?Good judgment comes with experience, and experience comes quickly.?<br>
<br>
	The game designers make sure every card has advantages and disadvantages. Take Darth Vader, from the Preimere Set. This character card is one of Star Wars CCG&#146;s most popular, next to Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.<br>
<br>
What are the advantages? Darth Vader&#146;s high power of 6 and his forfeit of 8, his ability of was the highest the Dark Side had before the realease of Emporer Palpatine from the<br>
Death Star II set. There?s an ability of four or more present, so you can draw battle destiny. He?s a pilot, and can pilot anything. He adds 3 to power of whatever he pilots and when he?s on his hip, it?s a power 6, manuever 6, hyperspeed 2 card. He?s a Warrior, and can carry a variety of weapons but the best choice is Darth Vader?s Lightsaber from the Death Star II Set. He?s a dark Jedi, qualifing him for cards that have a Dark Jedi requirement, such as Vader?s Eye and Dark Jedi Presense. If he?s with Grand Moff Tarkin,<br>
they draw a destiny and Tarkin can cancel one of the opponents. He adds one to battle destinies, which is good. Immunity to attrition &lt; 5. <br>
<br>
A few disadvantages, but they don?t overbalence the advantages. A deploy of 6 is expensive, though if condersidering how strong his is, he should be costly. His destiny of 1 isn&#146;t spectacular, especially if you drew him for a battle/weapon destiny. Being the guy named Vader himself can even have its downs. Uncontrollable Fury is one card that shows this. My point is...remember the balance in each card as you construct your deck. Weigh factors carefully, and consider how each card supports your strategy and the other cards in your deck. <br>
<br>
When you&#146;re starting out, testing decks, remember that any deck except for my NM NP ND! deck is unbeatable. Lol. Jk. A deck might play well against one type of deck and poorly versus another. With many different decks around, people are still designing one that beats them all. This is due to the expansion of the CCG with new cards. Your hypothetical SYCFA deck probably doesn&#146;t have many ground based characters. So it could be vulnerable to say... a Watch Your Step deck. Maybe you should take some cards out and replace them with characters, and you&#146;ll then be prepared for WYS, but beware! You will have made yourself vulnerable to something else. So you really need to consider all deck design?s flaws and strong points while designing. If your deck activates a good amount of Force, and you have ways to retrieve Force, it should create a balance for your<br>
decreased amount of ground characters. Test your strategy against a variety of deck types. You&#146;ll be surprised what you discover.<br>
<br>
Star Wars CCG isn&#146;t a difficult game, but it does take time to learn. Study the rules, and get used to the cards, and you&#146;ll be off to a start. More Chapters in the SW:CCG Newbie?s Guide to Come Soon, be on the lookout.<br>
