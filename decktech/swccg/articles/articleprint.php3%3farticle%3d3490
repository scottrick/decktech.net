You start Invasion/In Complete Control, Prepared Defences, Crossfire, An Entire Legion of My Best Troops, and Inconsiquential Losses.<br>
<br>
Your deck should have these cards<br>
1) There They Are! x 3-6<br>
2) Infantry Battle Droid x 7-15<br>
3) Battle Droid Blaster Rifle x 7-15<br>
4) Other stuff necessary for holding the theed throne room and  flipping  ie. Rune Hako, Nute Gunray, Unique Battle Droids<br>
5) Space Defence obviously, you don&#146;t need an exhorbitant amount<br>
6) Protection against the lightside version of Monnok (totally blanked on the name.) Should only take maybe 2 card slots.<br>
7) Good activation, ie. Naboo: Battle Plains, Naboo: Theed Generator Core,<br>
Naboo: Theed Generator, Naboo: Throne Room (duh!)<br>
8) The rest is optional, but I would suggest Imperial Artilery.<br>
<br>
Basically, you would have a kickass deck. With AELOMBT you would have destiny 8 battle droid blasters (yes I know others have though of this). With Inconsiquential Losses, you could forfeit those blasters to the used pile for 3 each, and recycle/track destiny 8 cards. With Droid Racks you get back your infantry battle droids each turn. This deck would rule for beatdowns. Picture this. You play two infantry battle droids to an opponents site for 2 each after you get invasion flipped. Thats 4. Next you give each of them a battle droid blaster. You initiate battle (for free if you can get out first strike) but usualy 1. Thats 5. During the battle you fire both blasters off at guys for 1 each, thats 7. Your odds of hitting are pretty good considering all of these high destiny cards. You also play There They Are (sorry forgot to say it earlier) at the beginning of the battle. Your power 2 battle droids are +1 because YOU initiated, and +1 because of There They Are. Thats two power 4, with a total power of 8. Then you get + 5 from crossfire making your power 13. Now heres the kicker. You get not 0, not one, but two battle destiny because of invasion. If you are any kind of descent player you will have been able to track two 8&#146;s from sometime earlier. This leaves you with 29 power, 16 attrition, and hopefully two hit guys who are each forfeit - 4 all for the small cost of 7 force. The same amount it takes to play Qui-Gon with lightsaber. :) Some may say it would be hard to get all of these cards into your hand, but with the massive amounts of force generation you get from all of your pullable Naboo sites, and the large amounts of them in your decks, it should not be a challenge at all. Just watch out for that dejirik (Grimtash?) that kills copies in your hand. If There they are gets grabbed thats ok too, because it is not vitally important. Anyway, after this battle ends, you can forfeit your blasters for up to 6 attrition allowing you to track them for a future battle. If you lose your droids too, just send them to the racks and get them back next turn. In the end, everyone will fall to those pesky little battle droids.<br>
