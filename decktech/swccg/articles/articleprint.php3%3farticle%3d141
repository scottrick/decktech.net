One of the basic aspects of SWCCG is battling.	Decipher has<br>
 recently made it a lot harder for decks that dont battle<br>
to win with cards such as Battle Order/Plan, Resistance/<br>
Ultimatum, Occupations/Celebrations, Secret Plans/Scrambled<br>
Transmission etc.  The key light battling traits are battle<br>
destiny adding and weapons.  Dark relies more on character<br>
removal, but has recently received a bunch of characters<br>
with weapons and can also add almost as much battle destiny.<br>
Here are some key dark removal cards:<br>
<br>
Trample.  Trample is really awesome.  A destiny 4 interrupt<br>
that recycles itself back into your deck as well as<br>
targeting at any time!	The 'drawback'- you have to have an<br>
AT-AT or AT-ST.  Try not to use this unless you have rigged<br>
your destiny draw.<br>
<br>
You Are Beaten.  This card is specific, requiring a lightsaber<br>
and 2 force.  At a destiny 3 lost interrupt it isnt<br>
spectacular, however Mara Jade has a stick as well as Darth.<br>
YAB can also search your reserve deck for I Am Your Father<br>
and is the only card that cancels Uncontrollable Fury.<br>
<br>
Dr. Evazan.  Dr. Death, affectionately referred to as Dr. E<br>
by many, is absolutely awesome.  While his stats arent great<br>
(D2, P1, A2, F3) he is destiny 3 and a pilot!	Dr. E can<br>
make any character hit or disarmed at same site immediately<br>
lost, though, this is an action, so they can shoot him before<br>
he operates.  Because of this you might want to play more<br>
than 1.<br>
<br>
DV, DLOTS.  This heavy hitter deserves his name spelled in<br>
full: DARTH VADER, DARK LORD OF THE SITH.  Built-in-Trample-Boy<br>
(BiTB)!  Once he hits the table Light will do one of two<br>
things.  They will either run from him or kill him.  Add<br>
his stick and he becomes very dangerous.  Once again, make<br>
 sure your destiny is rigged.<br>
<br>
Sniper.  Nothing too special, but it does the job.  The<br>
fact that it is a destiny 3 lost interrupt that only works<br>
in your control phase is very restrictive.  IAO/Insurrection<br>
will stop Elis, so that means that the guy has to survive<br>
a light turn without being killer or run from.<br>
<br>
Disarmed.  Not specifically character removal, but it keeps<br>
your guys alive.  Its destiny 5 and can kill guys with Dr.<br>
Evazan.  Make sure to remember you can deploy it in your<br>
opponents control phase.<br>
<br>
Built in stuff.  JQuille, IG-88 and 4-LOM all have built in<br>
character removal.  Of these I personally prefer 4-LOM.<br>
4-LOM always hits and adds a battle destiny with Jabba or<br>
Zuckuss.  IG-88 is incredibly versatile, with the ability<br>
to remove a Light character before they draw weapon destiny,<br>
and the ability to add a battle destiny with ANY bounty<br>
hunter.  JQuille is a hefty power 4 (6 on Hoth) who can<br>
exclude an opponents character of ability &lt; 3 from battle.<br>
Its worth noting that this happens before the weapons<br>
phase, so you can get two LS characters before your opponent<br>
gets to shoot back.  JQuille is also a spy.<br>
<br>
Duelling cards.  Destiny 6 lost interrupts that kill<br>
Obi-Wan or Luke if you have Vader.  Dont play them<br>
without a destiny rig (if theyre Epic) or without<br>
Monnoking your opponent to see if they have anything bad to<br>
stop them.<br>
<br>
Always Thinking With Your Stomach.  This interrupt<br>
compliments most of the other character removal strategies<br>
in that it needs high destiny to work, and is also high<br>
destiny.  Stop a force drain and make a character missing?<br>
Score!	Beware that it only works at exterior planet sites.<br>
<br>
Dark Strike.  Lose 1 force to make a hit character<br>
immediately lost?  Destiny 2 lost interrupt?  Bleech!  This<br>
interrupt can also be used to add 3 to lightsaber destiny<br>
or cancel Swing-And-A-Miss.  Dont be afraid to make your<br>
character immediately lost if hes being beat down and you<br>
dont have a Ghhk.  Doesnt have much over the Doc, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Im sure that Ive missed a few things, but thats the<br>
basics.  Hopefully youll be able to kill those EPPs<br>
before your opponent kills you.<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting,<br>

PS.	Adam, its ok to Sabbac away characters too.<br>
