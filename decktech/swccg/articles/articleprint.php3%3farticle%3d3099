lurtz and his fellow troop of uruk hai sneak up on the fellowship at the forest of lothlorien. they are confident they can open a can on those poor idiots. they hop out of the forest and charge.<br>
lurtz: ROAR!<br>
aragorn: oi, good thing were at a forest...<br>
lurtz: ugh...im tired!<br>
aragorn: hey arwen! hey legolas! loose!<br>
lurtz: ugh...im dead!<br>
<br>
so. if youre anything like me, you have probably had it with ARV. this card teeters on the border of being broken. of course, it is one of my favorite cards. ive used it on more than one occasion to kill off key minions and move on an extra site. unfortunately, everyone else has figured this out too, and now we need to know how to stop it. well start with the obvious shadow solutions, then finish up with the not so obvious fellowship solutions.<br>
<br>
moria. ah, moria. lots of guys. this is one of their best selling points to combating ARV. if you can put out 10 minions against 2 rangers, an elf and a hobbit, losing 2 to targeted archery isnt too bad. do this with host of thousands, they are coming and scimitar shenanigans. moria also has several anti archery cards, ie. pinned down, goblin archer (-6!) and wallcrawlers. perhaps the best way to keep your moria minions alive is to prevent wounds with the goblin armories. sure you can exhaust me, but ill be gosh darnited if im gonna take that wound. if all else fails, you can try to smack them around with unfamiliar territory.<br>
<br>
the nazgul(rags) have the second best chance of surviving ARV, even tho they are the most hurt by it, generally only having 2-3 guys out at one given time. additionaly, your best site (the ford) is ~gasp~ a river. however. you have several ways to prevent wounds with these rags. with all blades perish, you can prevent that final wound. with not easily destroyed, you can heal a rag in the MANUEVER phase or the skirmish phase. so, you say ok, your manuever action. he says ARV. you say, ok ill heal my guy. you can also reduce regular archery with wreathed in shadow. relentless charge is pure archer hate, while black breath is an indirect hindrance to directed archer (read xert to wound w/aragorn and legolas) fire by making it tough for them to heal. dont forget ulaire cantea- he can get rid of those annoying weapons, all while being a fierce 10 power. ulaire enquea can also mow down companions if the burdens get out of control, thus easily getting rid of an xhausted legolas.<br>
<br>
sauron has a tougher time, as many of their tricks require them to xert. however, these can all help against the directed archer fire so often used in conjunction with ARV. under the watching eye will keep the fellowship conservative with their xerting to wound, cuz lets face it...its not very much fun to lose legolas or aragorn to a well timed hate. you bring great evil is also handy in the same vein as black breath(see above). they also have mordor enraged- add tokens for each archer, letting you get out more lads to whup up on them rangers.<br>
<br>
now isengard has the best chance against the ARV abuse. with uruk hai armories reducing the archery total and sarumans spies skipping the archery phase wholesale, you have two very efficient ways of shutting down the felloships archery. the uruks also have an anti-archer card in the form of their arrows enrage. if youre lucky, you might even be able to pull off a caradras has not forgiven us, causing an xhausted character to just DIE. also, they have sarumans power, allowing you to discard all conditions- like the tale of gil-galad and the saga of elendil, both staples in the ranger abuse deck.<br>
<br>
basically, in your shadow phase you will want to accomplish two things:<br>
1. shut down/limit the archery phase;<br>
2. put as much hurt on the archers as you can.<br>
<br>
now, you may say how can my fellowship deck possibly help me against his? there are a couple of ways of doing this. one way is to let them go first. yeah, you heard me right. let them go first (bidding high enuf to choose if you have too, although this prolly wont happen- ranger decks like fewer burdens generally). then, fill your deck with as few rivers and forests as possible. unless they are playing with several pathfinders or thrors map, theyll be stuck at your dry, desolate sites where their rangers wont be quite so versatile. <br>
<br>
a second way to oppress their rangering ways is to deny them the cards they want. ranger decks generally are as close to 60 as possible, usually trying to run out of cards just as they run into site nine. with cards like galadriels mirror/white arrows of lorien and nobody tosses a dwarf/dwarf axe, you can respectively take cards out of their hand and take cards off their deck, thus taking them out of the game. this can xtend the lifespan of your multi wound guys immensely if you get rid of aragorns bow, double shots, ARV, etc.<br>
<br>
in conclusion, lets see how the story above could be changed after having read this article. now it goes like this:<br>
lurtz and his troop attack. this time, however, they have planned ahead. now, they wait until the fellowship is at galadriels glade. and they brought along some of sarumans spies. and theyre wearing armor from their armories.<br>
lurtz: ROAR!<br>
aragorn: oh, sh!t...im not versatile here!<br>
(thwack, thwack, SPLAT- 6 wounds later...)<br>
aragorn: well frodo, it couldve been worse...we only lost two companions, and im xhausted instead of dead!<br>
frodo: dude, youre fired.<br>
<br>
hope you enjoyed it.<br>
