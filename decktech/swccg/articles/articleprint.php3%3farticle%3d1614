It is a continuation/correction for the article Taking Down A Training Deck 101.  Just know that before you look at this.<br>
<br>
Second, try as I did to not make too much of a fool of myself, at one point in my article, I really did.  To my knowledge right now, most of the article is still relevant, and sound advice, but I feel the responsibility to correct any mis-information I have given.<br>
<br>
Third, the previous article was my first written, and in my excitement, all the ideas running around in my head, and the long time it took me to try and make it well written, there were a few things that I accidentally omited.  I will try and cover a few more things.<br>
<br>
  So, first and foremost, I must correct a pretty bad mistake.	When I was talking about the cards Broken Concentration and He Is Not Ready, I failed to mention that when training, the number of Dagobah sites gets added to the destiny.  Most full training decks have 4 sites.  With Dagobah system, it allows you to go and get one site per your deploy phase.  So, though in three or four turns BC and HINR may be useless, they still should be able to slow the light side down a turn or two, more if you are lucky.<br>
<br>
Now, on to other things you might come up against that I failed to cover...<br>
<br>
First, and old favorite of mine when I played a training deck was Supprise Assault.  With an automatic 7, that card could win the game in one turn.  Fortunately for you most of the training decks today include the card The Way Of Things.  Although this seriously speeds up his training, it also prohibits the use of SA.  If he doesn't start with TWOT, be wary.  The only thing I can say about that is make a probing force drain with say, a Vader or AT AT, where you will not lose too much force.  Remember, by then it will be impossible to Sense since he has flipped.<br>
<br>
Next thing, Force Retrieval.  This is a big part of a training deck, beginining with retrieving 10 right after he flips.  If this part of his game is killing you here are some cards that deal with that...<br>
<br>
Secret Plans:  Make him pay force to retrieve.	Not my personal favortite card, but it is a part of many decks.<br>
<br>
Come Here You Big Coward:  Make him occupy two battlegrounds or retrieval is totally canceled.	You can chose to play this one a couple of ways.  One: stack up on the battlegrounds and trust that his deck won't really be battle worthy until he is fully trained and make him come two you.  Two: have it in your hand and try and surprise him with it right before he is going to flip.	If he is set up for secret plans at the same time, he may not be able to get to the two battlegrounds.	Maybe.	Or three: just hope he is an idiot and doesn't realize until it is too late.  In any case, at least try and make him pay for retrieving.<br>
<br>
Something Special Planned For Them:  Also nice in a Space Power deck, this will at least put the On The Edge/Off The Edges out of play so they can't be retrieved.  It also works for stuff like Kessel Run, Harvest and whatnot.<br>
<br>
So there are some cards that will hinder force retrieval.  Unfortunately, when talking about a training decks, they will include anywhere from 2 to 5 of these cards.  Any deck that still has the ability to retrieve 24 force is still a bad thing for you.<br>
<br>
Now, some other things...<br>
<br>
Since we all know training takes a while, you could use that time to simply set up a foce to invade Dagobah.  Throw a bunch of characters in the bus or Slave 1 (prefferably the bus) and land it.  Just make sure that you have an abilty 4 or greater character.  Vader works just fine ;)  Take out the apprentice and viola!<br>
<br>
In conclusion I would like to first apologize again for my mistakes.  Then I would like to remind everyone that though I may be totally obsessed with training decks, they are only a small portion of them out there.	I am not trying to tell everyone to run out and totally stack up against them, but only hoped to give you some ideas on how you can change your playing style when coming up against this deck and being succesful.  If you are able to fit in a key card that works well with your existing deck, all the better.<br>

Remember, DIRECT DAMAGE IS THE BEST  : )<br>
