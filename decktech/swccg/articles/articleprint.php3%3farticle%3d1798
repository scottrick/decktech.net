<br>
     This article simply gives a small glimpse into the future of Star Wars, citing cards that haven&#146;t come out yet, but will. And some that may not, but are rumored to. As a prelude, for those of you who don&#146;t know, let&#146;s start with a list of Decipher&#146;s confirmed future card sets:<br>
<br>
Shadows of the Empire (30 card set)<br>
Skywalkers (full set based on Luke, Leia, and Vader)<br>
Jedi Masters (full set based on Jedi)<br>
Scoundrels (full set based on bounty hunters, Han, Jabba, and Lando)<br>
<br>
With that said, let&#146;s go to the cards.<br>
<br>
Cards confirmed to be made in the future:<br>
<br>
     Laser Cannon Battery<br>
<br>
Mentioned in the text of the Dominator, Juz says this is a card originally playtested for D*II, but now planned for release in a future set. Here&#146;s a part of Dominator&#146;s text:<br>
<br>
Laser Cannon Battery may deploy aboard (and may fire twice per battle).<br>
<br>
So all we know so far is that the Laser Cannon Battery cannot normally deploy on Victory-Class Star Destroyers. We also know that the Laser Cannon Battery will be good against starfighters, considering this part of the Dominator&#146;s lore:<br>
<br>
Engineered to support task forces combating Rebel starfighters.<br>
<br>
It was engineered for this purpose, which means it was modified to be a little different from other Victory-Class Star Destroyers. To be different would mean to have Laser Cannon Batteries, considering other Victory-Classes wouldn&#146;t have these. The addition of these weapons was the modification meant to combat starfighters. So we know that it&#146;ll be a Dark Side starship weapon that combats starfighters and normally can&#146;t deploy on Victory-Classes.<br>
<br>
     Fixer<br>
<br>
Mentioned in the text and lore of Camie. Here&#146;s part of the lore:<br>
<br>
Fixer&#146;s girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Already we can assume that Fixer will get along with Camie pretty well. Part of Camie&#146;s text:<br>
<br>
Forfeit +1 when present with Fixer. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy Luke (of power &lt; 4), Biggs or Fixer to same Tatooine site from Reserve Deck| reshuffle.<br>
<br>
This only confirms our assumptions. We know that Fixer will, if anything, be able to deploy on Tatooine. He&#146;ll probably get a bonus with Camie, or give Camie a bonus. So we know that he&#146;s a Light Side character that works well with Camie.<br>
<br>
     Thrawn<br>
<br>
Mentioned in the text of Chimaera. Here&#146;s the text segemt:<br>
<br>
Immune to attrition &lt; 4 (&lt; 5 while an Imperial leader aboard, &lt; 6 while Thrawn aboard).<br>
<br>
So we know that the Chimaera is Thrawn&#146;s ship. Fans of the novels will also note that he&#146;s a Grand Admiral. So we know he&#146;ll be a leader, a big leader, considering he commands the ship that acts as the acting command ship in the absence of the Executor. I personally can almost guarantee he&#146;ll be ability 3. Most high ranking Imperial leaders are, except Ozzel, but he&#146;s clumsy and stupid anyway, not quite the persona of the average Force-Attuned character. Thrawn is in novels including Shadows of the Empire, so we can assume that he&#146;ll be in that set. It&#146;s also been said in a Scrye magazine that a young version of Thrawn will be in the Skywalkers set.<br>
<br>
     Xizor<br>
<br>
Mentioned in an article on Decipher, Xizor is in Shadows of the Empire also. He&#146;s a reptilian Falleen prince, leader of the galaxy-wide crime organization known as the Black Sun. In the novel he has a fascination with Luke, and in the article on Decipher he&#146;s been mentioned, here&#146;s the excerpt from that article:<br>
<br>
And if you think it&#146;s bad when Palpatine gets his hands on Luke, just wait until Xizor enters the fray.<br>
<br>
From that and other info we know that he&#146;ll be a powerful Dark Side alien that functions with Luke from the Shadows Of The Empire set.<br>
<br>
Cards that have been hinted at:<br>
<br>
     Different Hutts<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s a text segment from Desilijic Tatoo:<br>
<br>
Deploy on your Hutt.<br>
<br>
So far, Jabba has been the only Hutt. So, why not just put &quot;deploy on Jabba&quot;? There is no reason not too, unless in the future there would be more Hutts. Assumed to be members of Jabba&#146;s clan, the Desilijic clan, so that they may bear the Desilijic Tatoo. Probably to be found in Scoundrels.<br>
<br>
     Virago<br>
<br>
Xizor&#146;s ship. It&#146;s been said that in the SOTE set, there&#146;ll be several new characters &quot;and their respective ships.&quot; So we can assume that Xizor&#146;s ship, the Virago, will be made.<br>
<br>
     Dash Rendar and the Outrider<br>
<br>
Both elements of Shadows of the Empire, Dash is a bit like Han, participating in the Battle Of Hoth, flying Rogue 11. The Outrider is his ship, a YT-2400 freighter.<br>
<br>
Rumored cards:<br>
<br>
     Light Side Mara Jade<br>
<br>
This card has come up in many discussions, supposedly to be made in the Shadows of the Empire set. This would be possible, considering the novels she does turn to the Light Side. So if she&#146;s made she&#146;ll be a Light Side Force-Sensitive or Jedi character.<br>
<br>
     Jade&#146;s Fire<br>
<br>
Mara&#146;s ship in the novels. It is contested which side this card will be made for. If Light Side Mara is made, than the ship could very well be Light Side, or perhaps for both sides. It&#146;s been noted that Decipher could make the ship, along with Mara&#146;&#146;s new persona, for the Light Side. This would give a little balance; Dark Side gets her saber, Light Side gets her ship.<br>
<br>
Interesting thought: In the original 2-Player Premiere Starter Set, in the Rulebook, they had a table of icons. Among these icons was a single block of 3 LS icons. They also had a single block of 3 DS icons. This was before A New Hope came out. When that set came out, they of course used the 3 DS icons on the Death Star. However, the 3 LS icons wasn&#146;t used and hasn&#146;t been used since. An interesting twist is that now, in the Glossary, the Force icons are represented one at a time, implying that a LS location with 3 icons will never be made, but was planned to be made at one time, being sometime after the original 2-Player Starter Set. Since playtesting could only accurately portray a card from maybe one or 2 sets away, it&#146;d be logical to make the 3 icon location in ANH, or perhaps Hoth or Dagobah. They did this with the Death Star for the DS, but not for the LS. I think they was a location originally intended to have 3 LS icons, maybe Massassi Ruins, Echo Command Center, Yoda&#146;s Hut, or even Dagobah. Who knows what could&#146;ve happened had they made a location with 3 Ls icons? I know this is all probably just my opinion and some huge assumptions, but it&#146;s still an interesting thought.<br>
<br>
Another Interesting Thought: Who remembers the Question Of The Day on Decipher&#146;s site? I don&#146;t think they have it anymore, please tell me if they do. Anyway, a long time ago, the question was:<br>
<br>
Which character would you like to have as a card?<br>
Dash Rendar, Prince Xizor, Grand Admiral Thrawn, or Mara Jade?<br>
<br>
The majority chose Mara Jade. A few months later, she was indeed made into a card. Had Decipher&#146;s decision to create her as a card been influenced by the response from the Question Of The Day? If so, then we could&#146;ve easily had one of the other choices as a card. After all, a survey can be a good indicator of what the players want. If they want Mara Jade, then Decipher know that if they create Mara Jade they&#146;re bound to make plenty of money.<br>
<br>
     This ends the article. Not the best of articles I realize, but it was something I felt like writing. Nobody may like it, but oh well. Hope at least one of you out there enjoyed it. I personally think the thought of future cards is a nice thought to think of. Notify me of any other cards they&#146;ll make in the future, I like to be on top of these things! Thanks for reading,<br>
