Hopefully, whether you are a new, intermediate, or advanced player, you can take some of the information in these articles and use it to create efficient, tournament-worthy decks.<br>
<br>
In part 1 of the series, we examined the Dark Side objective, This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time.	In this article we will examine the Light Side objective, Quiet Mining Colony.	Here is the exact game text of the card, as confirmed by Decipher.<br>
<br>
 Quiet Mining Colony<br>
Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.<br>
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 Force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.	Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations.<br>
Flip this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City).<br>
Place out of play if Bespin is 'blown away'.<br>
<br>
 Independent Operation<br>
While this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and [independent] starships are immune to attrition &lt; 4.  At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your [independent] starships are deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.<br>
Flip this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors).<br>
Place out of play if Bespin is 'blown away'.<br>
<br>
You should first notice what the objective deploys when it comes into play.  You are able to deploy the Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.  This allows you to have two immediate strategies: 1) you can convert your opponent's Cloud City site if he plays one; 2) you can have a secondary option if he does not play a Cloud City site.  Here's an example.  Suppose your opponent plays Carbon Chamber Testing and you are using Quiet Mining Colony.  He deploys the Security Tower and Carbonite Chamber, of course.	Then when your objective comes into play you deploy Bespin and-- guess what?  The Carbonite Chamber!  You have just hurt your opponent, and the game hasn't even started!  But suppose your opponent doesn't start with a Cloud City site?  You would then start with your own location, such as the Guest Quarters or the Casino.  But also note that if the opponent is using the new Dark Side objective, This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time, he will probably convert your Bespin system on the first turn.<br>
<br>
The first side of Quiet Mining Colony does two other things.  It allows you to use one force to deploy a site or Cloud sector to Bespin from your reserve deck. This empowers you to flip your objective more quickly, which I will discuss in the next paragraph.  The other game text hinders you: your opponent loses no more than one force from your force drains at Bespin locations.  This hurts you in the beginning of the game, especially against an Operatives deck that flips quickly.  But once you flip Quiet Mining Colony, the fun starts!<br>
<br>
Flipping the Light Side objective is, in a way, difficult.  To flip the card, you must control Bespin: Cloud City and two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on table).  In addition, your opponent may not control any Bespin locations at the time.  But the additional game text on Quiet Mining Colony allows you to potentially flip your objective on the second turn (by deploying locations from your reserve deck).  On the first turn you deploy a site from reserve deck and control the two sites if possible.  On the second turn deploy Bespin: Cloud City from reserve deck, control Bespin and Bespin: Cloud City, and you've flipped the objective!<br>
<br>
Although you do not necessarily have to flip Quiet Mining Colony, there are numerous advantages to creating a deck that does.  First, your Aliens, Cloud Cars, and Independent Starships are immune to attrition &lt; 4.  This is superb protection for your characters, whether you have Eloms or Pucumir Thyress.  Second, whenever you control a Bespin location with an alien, your force drains may not be modified or canceled there.  This, when used effectively and efficiently, will usually bring the opponent to his knees.  A Clouds or Pucumir Thyress deck will be hard to beat once you have flipped this objective.  Third, your independent starships deploy -1.  Though this text may not be extremely powerful, it will help you defend your sectors and Bespin system, which will be essential to keeping your objective flipped.	In my opinion, the next game text is not very useful.  It allows you to deploy a docking bay from reserve deck once a turn.  At first, no useful ideas come to mind for utilizing this text.  Even though this provides you with transportation options to fight the opponent, why not force drain instead?  When building a deck using Quiet Mining Colony, you shouldn't count on the docking bay game text to give you a serious advantage.  In the future, perhaps, we might see cards that enhance the use of docking bays.  At the moment, however, I don't see an apparent usage for this part of the game text that would give an advantage greater than using cards that enhance your draining potential or defensive posture. [Note: if someone knows a way to utilize this text that I've overlooked, please contact me!]<br>
<br>
Now that you know how to flip Quiet Mining Colony and what the advantages to flipping it are, you must learn what it takes to keep the objective flipped.  Unfortunately, all the opponent must do to un-flip your objective is to control the Bespin system or three locations related to Bespin.  Therefore, to keep Quiet Mining Colony flipped, you need to be able to play defensively, not giving up any ground.	You must be able to hold Cloud City.  At first this may seem difficult, but with an efficient deck design all that is required is play-skill.<br>
<br>
There are three main ways to disrupt the opponent's offensive attempts against your Cloud City garrison.  The first is to shut down Elis Helrot.  I expect that every good deck using Quiet Mining Colony will be using either Sic-Six, Quite A Mercenary, or Insurrection to stop Elis Helrot.  Any combination of these will be essential to your 'Quiet Mining Colony.'  The second is to increase the deploy cost of the opponent's characters to Cloud City.  This can be accomplished by H'nemthes, Goo Nee Tay, and Restricted Deployment.	In my opinion, H'nemthes are currently the best option because the Dark Side objective, This Deal is Getting Worse All The Time, prevents Goo Nee Tay from hurting Cloud City, Jabba's Palace, and Special Edition characters.  The third way to disrupt the opponent's offensive attempts is through battle-avoiding cards and damage-preventing cards.  Cards such as It's A Trap and Houjix are excellent because not only are they efficient, they are immune to Sense!  Other good cards include Arconas, It Could Be Worse (which can also be used to allay force drains), Lift Tube Escape (used in conjunction with Lift Tubes, of course), and a Yoxgit combo I heard about.  This combo involves using Artoo to search for Hero Of A Thousand Devices, then searching for a Fire Extinguisher.  You use the Extinguisher to cancel the battle, then Yoxgit to retrieve it into your hand.  The cycle starts over.  A possible set of cards for this combo are as follows:<br>
<br>
2x Yoxgit<br>
3x Tibanna Gas Miner<br>
2x Artoo<br>
Artoo, Come Back at Once!<br>
2x Hero of a Thousand Devices<br>
2x Fire Extinguisher.<br>
<br>
This protects your Tibanna Gas Miners from the Imperials, allowing you to concentrate on protecting your Cloud sectors.  You could even add Order To Engage and All My Urchins to increase the risk for your opponent.	There are other ways to protect Cloud City, but I will not discuss them in this article.<br>
<br>
The next step is to build your Quiet Mining Colony deck.  Here are some of my suggestions:<br>
<br>
1) Dedicated Cloud Drain deck Very simple: drop-and-drain, then play defensively to keep your objective flipped.  An interesting idea I had was to play Sabacc, but then you'd be risking your starfighter protection (if you lose).  Cloud City Celebration is an excellent addition.<br>
2) Dedicated Ground Drain deck This involves using Pucumir Thyress to enhance your Cloud City site drains.  Again, Sabacc and Cloud City Celebration are good additions.<br>
3) The Combination deck A mix of both clouds and ground support.  How you play a deck in a specific game is dictated by what the opponent plays.  Eloms are great support in this deck-type.<br>
4) The New 'Don't Tread On Me' deck Refer to Mike Fitzgerald's (Iceman) Don't Tread on Me for more information.  Basically this would be a very similar ground drain deck with lots of counters.<br>
5) Cheese Elom's, Tibanna Gas Miners, Clouds, and Never Tell Me The Odds!  An interesting combination that I would dare say should not be ignored!  This is potentially the best way to abuse this objective.<br>
<br>
There are many cards that are essential to the success of your Quiet Mining Colony deck.  You need lots of Starships and Cloud Cars (if using clouds) to keep the objective flipped.  Sic-Six, Quite A Mercenary, and Insurrection protect you from Elis Helrot.  Lando (especially the Enhanced Cloud City version) and Lobot are good characters to add.  Don't Tread On Me is a great way to start off the game, with Sense/Alter protection, Numbers protection, and Manipulation protection.  Lift Tubes are good protection against Dark Side attacks, and a Lift Tube Escape or two would be even better.  Pucumir Thyress will work well in any Cloud City deck.  Cloud City Celebration and Sabacc/Casino cards can be your retrieval engines and work wonders against Operatives and ISB decks.  Harc Seff will help against Hunt Down and Dark Deal.  And NEVER leave home with a Clouds deck that doesn't have a Tibanna Gas Miner and Kebyc in it!<br>
<br>
There are a few Dark Side decks that will give a Quiet Mining Colony deck a hard time.	The Big Blue archetype is becoming more and more popular, and the only way you will have a chance is to keep control of Bespin.  If you don't, you will probably be sunk.  As always, Operatives will be a challenge, but with Celebration retrieval and un-modifiable draining you should have some very fun games.  Since Hunt Down decks will soon gain another asset, Crush the Rebellion, I would expect to see them at tournaments.  Keeping them under constant pressure from drains should push you ahead.  Canceling Visage of the Emperor will help, too.  You shouldn't have a problem against ISB, but watch out for the Occupation decks.  An ISB deck on Cloud City could tear a 'Quiet Mining Colony' apart!  Ralltir Ops probably cannot withstand a good Quiet Mining Colony deck.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope you have enjoyed these articles, and that you have learned something about this new objective, Quiet Mining Colony.  Thanks for your time, and may the Force be with you!<br>
