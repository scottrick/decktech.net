I think I'm gonna go crazy if I hear a TIE deck is gonna beat another one of the LS decks I post. So I've decided to write an article on how I review decks and hope others do to.<br>
<br>
A.) Theorize how well it'd do v. dominant deck types on the opposing side.<br>
<br>
    LS Decks - Should have counters to DS Ops , ISB , HDADTJ w/ and w/o dueling , CCT Manip ,Mains and Toys ,  and Big Blue decks that are emerging.<br>
<br>
    DS Decks - Should have counters to Hidden Base , MWYHL , Mains and Toys , LS Ops , and that's all the major ones.<br>
<br>
B.) Question if it has counters or can handle popular themes.<br>
<br>
    1. Does it have numbers protection ?<br>
    2. Does it have or need SAC,Sense-Alter-Control	    protection<br>
    3. Can it protect against a degenerate deck ? ( Direct Force loss Visage , destiny 7 madnesses , Dagobah Drain , Droid Inserts , etc. )<br>
    4. Can it win in a drain race or at least come close<br>
    5. Does it need to battle on multiple planets to win the game ? Can it hold its own on its home field and the opponent's.<br>
    6. Will it survive if the deck gets beat down on one turn ?<br>
    7. Does it generate enough to deploy its stuff maybe taking into account Goo Nee Tay or BFHI.<br>
<br>
C. Questions for popular combos :<br>
<br>
    1. What does it do about Vader and Tarkin or EPPs ?<br>
    2. Can it stop the Yoxgit Landing Claw trick or Undercover Madness ?<br>
    3. Can it stop a never ending loop ( i.e. Harvest , Off The Edge , etc. )<br>
<br>
D. Rogue Decks and ideas :<br>
<br>
  I try not to throw a rogue decks out because what may be played in my area ( Musicians ) might not be played in your area. I don't see many *GOOD* CC Trooper decks or many good TIE decks , or some MWYHL with freaking Under Attack to blow up my Walkers , so I won't make comments like that.<br>
<br>
Important Note : The point of reviewing a deck is to say how you think it would do against dominant deck types and not try to find some crazy strategy that will easily beat it. Like saying watch out for Surprise Counter Assault with a zillion Ewoks on Endor or Counter Surprise Assault with a zillion troopers on Cloud City , it may happen but that is usually just silly gimmicky stuff. 'til next time<br>
<br>
Pavlik / Beware of the Imperial Decree , CPI , and ISB Ops deck , it's a killer.<br>
