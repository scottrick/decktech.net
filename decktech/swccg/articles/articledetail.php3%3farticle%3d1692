<br>
I remember a long time ago, in a galaxy farWell let me just cut to the chase!  When I first started collecting Star Wars about three years ago I was ignorant in more ways than one about the game.  However, one area where I most surely was lacking knowledge revolved around the notorious red cards---you knowthose cards that when you see them in your rare slot of your pack you say, crap!  Well several years later (and a lot of heartbreaking experiences later) Im back as a wiser, smarter Star Wars player who now fully understands the POWER OF THE RED CARD.	Although this article might seem to touch on areas most of us are familiar with, Im still going to take the time to discuss two interrupts that are shaping the game of SW:CCG: You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers and Imperial/Rebel Barrier.  Ahhhhhhso youve heard of them?  Thats good.  I wont have to spend half a page telling you what these cards read; instead, Ill just focus on what these cards mean for Star Wars players around the world.<br>
<br>
Death Star II has forever changed the game.  No more are decks like Harvesters, Scanning Crew Manipulators, and Operatives viable.  But there is one thing still unchanged by DS II, the shear essence of Star Wars itself: CONFRONTATION!  Every fun or tournament game youll ever play in will have battles, weapons, and those pesky little red cards that give you or your opponent the upper hand.  Sometimes those red cards will give you a slight advantage, but often those red cards will hand you a win on a silver platter, free for the taking.  Smoke Screen is one of those cards that give you a slight upper hand by increasing your opponents attrition; however, Imperial/Rebel Barriers and You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers are one of those cards that hand you the win (and sometimes a tournament).  Dont believe me?  Look at every BHBM deck!  Theyll have between one and three You Are Beatens and at least one barrier.  The same applies for MWYHL and Throne Room decks just with the You Are Beatens being replaced by Clash of Sabers and the Imperial Barriers being replaced by Rebel Barriers.<br>
<br>
Still in the dark?   Well let me cast some light on the subject.  You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers is essentially the same card---just one is DS and the other is LS.  Simply put, these cards allow you to force one of your opponents characters (your choice) to lose the ability to move and battle until the end of your next turn.	Imperial/Rebel Barrier Im sure everyone knows just because its been around for so long, but Ill give you a card summary anyway.  Barriers let you block a just deployed character or starship from moving or force draining.  Why is that important?  Im glad you asked.read on!<br>
<br>
THESE TWO VARIATIONS OF CARDS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY WIN GAMES (as the article title implies).  They accomplish this by forcing the opponent to lose hoards of force in a single turn without any risk to you.  Never do you have to play a card that might lose you the game (like an unsuccessful duel in a Hunt Down deck or an Elis Herlot that is stopped by Quite a Mercenary).  If your new to the game or unfamiliar with the nature of the cards in discussion with this article, let me tell you exactly how they change the complexion of the game by giving you examples and specific strategies involving these cards.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (Barrier): Your probing for your opponents hidden base without Security Precautions (which prevents battle damage where you have a probe card).  You have only nine force active and Boosks Bus in your hand.  You want to probe Corulag cause you got this hunch thats his hidden base, but you got no where you can run to cause your opponent has tons of power at every other system.  If only you could probe his hidden base without taking tons of battle damage!  You can if you have a barrier in your hand.  Simply deploy to Corulag where your opponent only has a single starship, probe, and then stay where you are.  You dont have to worry about your opponent coming down on you next turn with a beatdown squad cause you can prevent anything he deploys from battling you (or moving for that matter).  One RED CARD, Imperial Barrier, just gave you a chance to win the game that you would not of otherwise had unless you had a barrier.  Hail the barrier!!!<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers): Your involved in what so far promises to be a tight game.  You have Vader w/ Lightsaber at the Cantina against EPP Han and Leia.  Yes, you can cancel one of their destinies but that still leaves three chances for the LS to hurt you (either two shots with a blaster and one destiny or one shot with a blaster and two destiny).  You have one card in your hand: You Are Beaten.  Voila!  Cantina is your site.  Pay two force to You Are Beaten Leia w/ Blaster, so she cant battle or move for a couple of turns.  Now initiate a battle against a lone Han (who is eligible to be stomped in a battle since nothing is preventing him from participating).  With Leia and Han together despite you being able to cancel any of their destiny draws, they still had three ways to hurt you.  Now they have zero!  Han does not draw destiny, and only has three ability, wiping out any chance of him drawing battle destiny.  Simply hit Han with your lightsaber and cancel his blaster draw.  You have ten power plus a destiny to his four power (with a forfeit of zero)!  LS characters have seen better days when this happens!<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers combined with Barriers): Youre in a long drawn out gameagain!  You got Luke and Obi-Wan at Spaceport Docking Bay on Raltir against a Vader not eager to fight.  Your opponent is playing Raltir Ops with docking bays combined with Mobilization Points for activation.  Your opponent deploys Igar to the docking bay, planning to docking bay transmit both Vader and Igar to the Executor: Docking Bay where theyre safe and sound.  Wrong.  All you got to do is pay a force and Rebel Barrier Igar.  Now Igar cant move; thus, he cant docking bay transit with Vader, meaning Vaders got to either let Igar get stomped or get stomped with him!  Your opponent says a word not to be repeated when he discovers his dilemma, but he decides to cut his losses and just keep Vader at the Spaceport Docking Bay with Obi and Luke.  On your next turn you activate 15 force.  Recognizing that the DS is in trouble, you deploy Lukes Lightsaber on Luke and put down EPP Han for safe measure.  You play Clash of Sabers to place Vader out of any battle for the next couples of turns,  Now Igar is all alone against a lot of power with multiple weapons.	Two words ladies and gents.GAME OVER!<br>
<br>
Example 1 showed you the power of a barrier in space.  Example 2 showed you the power of a strategically played You Are Beaten.  And best of all, Example 3 showed you how two of the best interrupts in the game can work to your advantage in combo.	The best thing about these interrupts is demonstrated in my examples.  Barriers work both in space and on the groundwhereas You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers almost promise you a game when played at the right time without any risk to you!<br>
<br>
Here are some basic strategies that are important when playing with these cards<br>
1. Timing is key.  Remember that the word just in both Barriers game text means that you must use the card directly after your opponent deploys whatever you want to barrier.  The rules state that you can request a pause in game play to weigh your options, so dont feel pressured in terms of timejust keep that in mind.	The same goes for You Are Beaten and Clash of Sabers.  I recommend playing these cards before you initiate you battles because cards like Weapon Levitation (which is a just action) can strip you of your saber that you need to play either You Are Beaten of Clash of Sabers, leaving you in a mess of trouble.  Although it is more beneficial to initiate, hit a character, then place that character out of the battle (since its hit and already has to be lost), its much more risky taking this approach for the reason stated above.	Some players like to initiate the battle and place the hit character out of the battle, so its lost at the end of the battle and does not block their force drain the next turn.<br>
2. You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers is optimal when your opponent has two characters at a site (preferably one that does not draw battle destiny).  This is because you can place one of the characters out of the battle (usually the one that draws destiny or allows a destiny draw) and still have ability to beat down on!<br>
3. These cards work well in unison (as shown in Example 3).  Just keep that in mind.<br>
4. Barriers and You Are Beaten/Clash of Sabers are NOT INVINCIBLE!  They both can be cancelled by sense.  Both can be grabbed, which really hurts with a barrier cause its a recyclable four destiny.  And cards like weapon levitation can strip you of the saber you need to play a card.<br>
<br>
WellIve said just about everything I wanted to say.  I did a little praising of two card variations I thoroughly like, and hopefully I combined that with some useful information.  Star Wars has come a long way since Premeire, but one thing still remains the same: the game is based on winning battles.  Yeahforce draining is important, but you cant force drain if you cant win battles cause you wont be able to hold a site or system.  Thanks for reading this article that was tediously long, and good luck with two of the best interrupts in the game (unless youre playing against me)!  Feel free to put any extra info in your reviews.  Ill post this article again and include everyones ideas!<br>
<br>
Oh!  By the way.  I did not forget that Clash of Sabers lets you pull Uncontrollable Fury out of your reserve deck and You Are Beaten lets you can Uncontrollable Fury.  Its just my hands are tired.  Another couple of pages on that would just be pointless cause you all by now already recognize the power of the two best interrupts in the game!  Heres to winning!<br>
