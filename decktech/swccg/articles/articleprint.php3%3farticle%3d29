It is never to early to start metagaming and discussing ideas with other players. The time to start is now. With Endor almost upon us, you may want to start saving up for a few boxes of it so you can have the edge when time rolls around. Knowing what every card does and having a few copies of any given card can be crucial. You never want to be in the position where you need to ask the opponent what a card does.<br>
<br>
Another thing that may help you in your quest to build the ultimate deck is to try out cards you don't normally play with. This is why I like sealed deck tournaments. You can take a card you've probably never seen before and make it work against the opponent. Doing this will increase your knowledge of the game and make you a better player.<br>
<br>
When building your regional decks, you need to remember to put in counters for every deck type out there. You don't want to be in your 6th game of your preliminary, and forget to put in Odds protection and get crushed by one, sending you swirling back into the losers bracket. I have done this myself, and it is not very fun. That is why I suggest you play with these cards:<br>
<br>
Dont Forget the Droids/Torture<br>
Controls<br>
What Are You Tryin To Push On Us?/There'll Be Hell To Pay<br>
Do Or Do Not/There Is No Try<br>
Broken Concentration<br>
Secret Plans<br>
Evader<br>
Houjix/Ghhhk<br>
<br>
These are very versatile cards. Many can be used for more than one occasion. For example, Dont Forget The Droids is a nice 6 destiny, so even if your opponent is not playing Odds, that still has a lot of use. Playing with these cards will help you in regionals, I guarantee it.<br>
<br>
Having the counters is a very good start to building your deck. You'll now want to devise a plan or strategy that you'll follow through the course of the game. Having counters but no plan will get you no where. You'll always want to make a strategy that, in some way, causes force loss. An Imperial Decree deck with no drain potential is not going to win. If you added more Hoth locations and possibly a Walker Garrison strategy, you would most likely do very well. But, since the walkers have high deploy, youll need means to activate force, which leads me to my next topic, locations.<br>
<br>
Having force is essential to any deck. Not being able to activate enough, fast enough can cost you the game. Usually, if you have a mains and toys deck you'll want around 8-10 locations. This will ensure you that you can have force when you need it. Though, some decks don't even use that many and still do very well on a consistent basis. Why? Most likely because their stuff has a small deploy or they are getting it by some other means. It all depends on what you hope to accomplish.<br>
<br>
Countering Counters<br>
<br>
So now you have your idea and your counters, and you know how you will get the job done, but there is one more thing that stands in your way. The opponents counters. This is one of the hardest steps to metagame, because you have no idea what the opponent is playing (usually). You'll need to scout out which cards will prevent you from accomplishing your objective, and try to counter it. For example, if your deck relies heavily on many of a certain card, you'll want to play Yarna D'al Gargan or Well Guarded to prevent Grimtaash and Monnok, as well as some other stuff to keep it alive. It's all about choosing the right mixture of cards.<br>
<br>
Sense and Alter are the default counters to most any deck. By cancelling your interupts and effects, they have nullified your chance to put cards back or add that destiny when you really need it. To counter this, youll want There Is No Try/Do Or Do Not and/or Oppresive Enforcement/Wise Advise. You may even want to play Sense and Alter yourself. It's all about metagaming.<br>
<br>
Testing Your Deck<br>
<br>
This is one of the most important things when building your deck. Youll need to test it against any type of deck out there. Doing this will make you more aware of your decks strengths and weaknesses, and it will tell you how to play and tune your deck to get its full potential. Add the cards you think you need more of, and always beware of new strategies that almost appear over night.<br>
<br>
Playing Your Deck<br>
<br>
So, you havent had a bath or brushed your teeth in 2 months, and you are getting ready to play your deck in your qualifying event. This is where all of your hard work and dedication pays off. Most likely, youll get nervous, and if this happens, lean back, take a deep breath, and relax, because you might as well quit if you're that nervous. The person with the best deck goes to the 1999 World Championships, and the rest go home. Hopefully, you'll do well. That leads me to my next section...<br>
<br>
Its Just A Game<br>
Alright, alright, so you went 4-2 because you got a crappy draw and you swear that guy had to have cheated. You tried your best, but it wasn't good enough, and now the time has come to go back home. With this in mind, I'd just like to say thats its only a game. Have fun with it, dont be so cut throat. You most likely met some new guys and had a blast, so be thankful that you got the oppurtunity to do it.<br>
