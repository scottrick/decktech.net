<br>
<br>
I have been playing this game since the beginning. I have also played against some of the best players in the world. Through all of this, I would like to share with you some tidbits of information I have picked up, that you may not know. But I do need to fore warn you, not all of these secrets are ethical. I consider some of them down right cheating. However if you understand the techniques, you will be better equipped to keep the playing field level when used against you, and give you the competitive edge.<br>
<br>
Butterflies are normal when you start that first game, especially at a big tourney like a Con or at DecipherCon. The common symptoms are jittery muscles, increased heart rate, sweating, or cold chills. You will also notice it may be a little hard to concentrate. If you find yourself in this situation, mentally slow yourself down. Make sure you breathe deeper to get more oxygen in your blood. Taking a walk will help also, but you will want to intentionally walk slower, concentrating on your breathing, and make sure you chew some gum. The chewing action is a natural relaxer that will work subconsciously. This will help your body get back to normal quicker.<br>
<br>
If your opponent just played a card that you are not 100% sure of the text and play characteristics, never take their word on what the card does. Always read the car and if you still have any questions, call over the tournament director for a ruling. The best players are many times the worst at telling you what it does. I have seen it happen too many times where the confidence and fame of one player, can be intimidating to the point of the other player just taking their word for the playability of a card, and it not being 100% accurate.<br>
<br>
One of my opponents was shuffling his deck prior to a game at DecipherCon. He carried on a conversation while he was going through the motions of shuffling. Then he took 5 cards from the side, evenly inserted them and handed me the deck to cut so we could start the game. Because I was paying attention, I slid his deck back to him and told him to shuffle his deck. He had just put his 5 Vader&amp;#8217;s evenly in his deck to assure him of getting one for his Hunt Down deck as quickly as possible.  From the expression on his face, he was very shocked he got caught, and it was obvious he had done this trick many times.<br>
<br>
If you are playing against a Hidden Base deck, at the moment they flip the objective, act mildly surprised. Look at them in their eyes and say: Is your hidden base on the table? All the while watching their eyes. Sub-consciously they will naturally look right at the system, giving you a very strong clue where to start your probes. This takes some practice, but extremely effective in quickly probing the correct system.<br>
<br>
Insurrection or Imperial Arrest Order is on the table. One party tries to nabron over to a docking bay. The other party says &amp;#8220;that is an interior site&amp;#8221;. I have seen this happen many times, where the other party says &amp;#8220;Oh Yea&amp;#8221; and takes the action back. This is just one example of not reading the cards carefully or being caught up in the game and you make a minor mistake. This person just stated a fact that the docking bay was an interior site, but in reality was using his knowledge of the rules and cards, to intimidate or test the skills of the other player&amp;#8217;s knowledge.  The best players use mind games like this all to often.<br>
<br>
We all know there is an air of anticipation on that first game of a big tourney. I have seen players intentionally miss-count decks to get the nerves of the opponent on edge even further. All though it is a temporary feeling, it can be very sickening and can get you on the verge of a panic attack to think you only have 59 cards in your deck. It is virtually impossible to tell if it was intentional or not, but the effects can linger for several minutes into the critical first few minutes of the game. Most importantly it disrupts your mental preparation. I have also seen it used mid-tournament with a question attached, &amp;#8220;did you leave any inserts in your last opponents deck&amp;#8221;? If or how you answer this, may have just given your opponent the edge he needs to pull out the starting effect that will benefit him the most. The best way to combat this is to count your deck multiple times prior to the tourney. This will give you the reassurance it is their error, not yours.<br>
<br>
Many times in the heat of battle, accidents happen. A common one I have seen is lost effects going into the used pile. I have lost a game to this one before. I wasn&amp;#8217;t paying close enough attention, and some how this person played a smoke screen on me three times in a single game, even though he only had one in his deck and no regeneration.  When accidents like that happen, you have to ask yourself, was it really an accident? In any event, once a game is over, there is nothing you can do about it. So always keep track of those interrupts played in battles.<br>
<br>
Nabron and Ellis can be game winning cards if played at the right time. If I fear one being used on me, I start leaving two force, in my active pile. I have won countless games that could have gone the other way by leaving those force. If the opponent doesn&amp;#8217;t have anyway to eliminate you using Quite a mercenary, or Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo, the risk can be to great for them to try the transport card. I actually start leaving force if I see one get turned up for destiny or if one goes in the lost pile. Bluffs do not always work, but under many circumstances they can buy you time.<br>
<br>
Have you ever noticed when someone deploys characters, vehicles, or ships, they always start with the big guy first. No one ever deploys Wedge, Chewy, Han, Luke, &amp; Obi. It is always in the reverse order. If you fear the opponent may drop a barrier on you, try deploying in the reverse order that you would normally deploy. Many times this can bait them in playing the barrier on your little guys, leaving the big guns to the task at hand.<br>
<br>
Stalling is normally regarded as a bad word. Nobody likes someone who stalls out in a game, especially if it happens to them. Stalling only hurts the winner, it has no impact on the looser. But it still happens, and I have to admit I have used it to my advantage on a rare occasion. Some of the most obvious ones are taking 3 minutes to decide to activate force. Anyone can recognize that, but there are more subtitle techniques that are hard for a tournament director to make a call on. Rules questions, taking an action and then taking it back, reading the stats of each card on the table, adding up total power at different locations, counting piles and cards in hand, can all kill time on the clock. Even confronting the offending party and arguing over the situation can take up several minutes. If you know what to look for that is half the battle. But the real mistake most people make, is they wait till there is 3 or 4 minutes left in the game before they get a tournament director involved. At that point it is too late. The only effective way to solve this problem is call the TD over with at least 10 minutes left. This will allow plenty of time for the judge to call attention to the offender, but will most likely speed them up just by being there.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned earlier, some of these tricks are unethical and are methods by which some use to cheat. Others can be very practical, and I hope this information will help you improve your game. Any one of these topics could have been a whole article unto its self, but the point was to bring these techniques to your attention. With knowledge there is power, and I hope this has given you the power to use, recognize, &amp; counter, various &amp;#8220;tricks of the trade&amp;#8221; to make you a better tournament player.<br>
