The decks that this article does not cover are such decks as throne room mains and any variations on the subject.  That deck makes your opponent&amp;#8217;s game, your game, that deck is not the type of deck that I am discussing.  Revolution designs are another type that this deck does not cover.  Revolution also makes your opponent&amp;#8217;s game, your game.  Manipulation follows the design of the deck somewhat, although in some decks it is also reacting to your opponent.<br>
The type of deck that I am speaking of is a deck that has its own purpose.  Almost every objective has a purpose that is totally separate from your opponent&amp;#8217;s deck.	Objectives are a prime example of the type of deck of which is speak.  Most decks that are out there are based on the deck-builder&amp;#8217;s game plan.  S/he sets up an idea for the deck, and then constructs it.  Some cards are placed in the deck to react to the opponent, which is necessary, but the basic idea is the deck builder&amp;#8217;s own.	Playing your own game is, in simple terms, to follow your own guidelines.  A profit deck rescues han and then drains and gives direct damage.  D*II objectives try to turn one of the Skywalkers (son/father) to the other side.  RalOps and Operative decks set up their own planet separate from anyone else to make the kill.  Once you stray from your own game and start playing your opponent&amp;#8217;s game, you have already lost.<br>
Allow me to demonstrate some of what I mean.  I played a game with a friend of mine outside of a tournament.  I was playing a DBO deck, and he was going Dark Deal.  My deck was not the best constructed, it was an idea I wanted to try out in a game.  The dark deal was an excellent idea.	It is a 4 star deck at this side (Paint the Town Blue version something or other).  But despite his superior deck, I could have beaten him had I not made the mistake of playing his game rather than mine.<br>
We had both flipped out objectives, he had CC Occupation and Dark Deal, with 3 sites he was draining at each turn, as well as CC and Bespin.  I had four Dantooine sites down, three were set up for drains of 3, but he had U-3PO at one of my sites.	I had an X-Wing assault squadron at Dantooine and two more in my hand, along with Tantive IV.  Coruscant and Kessel were both down.  I decided that since he had damaged one of my drains on the ground I would try to set him back by taking Bespin.  He had sitting at his planet the Executor and Bossk in Bus.  I moved my squadron over to engage him, which was my mistake of the night.	I started playing his game the minute I left my design.  I could have drain 4 at Kessel or Coruscant.  Coruscant was too far for him to even get to with his starship that were down.  Once I moved the squadron to Bespin he slapped down avenger and battled me.  My immunity saved me from attrition, but the power forced me to forfeit.  He lost the bus.	The next turn, having not learned by lesson and angry from being beaten, I put down Tantive IV and a squadron, which I moved to Bespin.  He proceeded to drop Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, canceling my battle destiny for the battle, taking out Tantive IV.  In the two turns for each of us since I had abandoned my game, I had drain a total of 8, and he had drained me about 20.  My next turn I finally pulled Home One, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have the force to deploy.  He had lando in the executor, so I couldn&amp;#8217;t deploy Super Falcon.  The game was decided and I had lost.	He ended the game with a 12 force win.<br>
The game taught me the lesson of playing my own game.  I will demonstrate how you can play your own game by showing an excellent deck-type for this idea.  I will explain the idea behind a TDIGWAT deck.<br>
With Prepared Defenses from D*II this deck becomes incredible.	Some people use direct damage as their main tool, but it will stick with straight drains.  With the objective and Prepared Defenses you can start by pulling secret plans and all wrapped up, plus three more effects.	Crush the Rebellion is excellent, as is Battle Order, since you have to control the system to flip anyway.  The other effect will vary according to the specifics of the deck.	You can use the objective to pull occupation and dark deal, which gives you 7 effects pulled with only one card used up.  But back to the purpose of this article, you set up on cloud city as fast as possible.  I have seen people playing an EBO deck, which is very tough to play with deal, go onto hoth, separating themselves from their own objective.	This is suicide.  You set up on cloud city and flip at a maximum four turns.  Once the card is flipped you stay at home and drain.  Dark deal gives drains of usually 3-4 per site.  Occupation adds another 1 per site that can&amp;#8217;t be cancelled with drain modifiers.  Imperials prevent the drain from being modified anyway.  All you do is sit at Bespin with the Executor and either a pilot or another ship, and be careful for a beat down.  With what should be 10-12 force from drains, and 3-4 force from occupation it should take only 2-3 turns for the game to be over.	This deck is one of the most important decks to stay at home with.  If you leave, you give up valuable resources that should be kept on the city.  If you stay and defend yourself, then the game should never be in question.<br>
Playing your own game requires discipline.  Sometimes a crazy maneuver might be enough to damage your opponent&amp;#8217;s deck, but against an experienced player it will not.  Whenever you divert resources to areas that they were not intended to be sent, the game is jeopardized.  I&amp;#8217;m not talking about suicide missions here, they are meant for a space deck that has a few characters to drop, kill and then die.	Playing your own game is the only way that you can beat the top players.  They are experts at their game, they don&amp;#8217;t often worry about what their opponent might be going to do in the next three turns.  They might have interrupts or effects designated for defense against a particular deck type, but the best know their game, and how to play it.  They stick to their game, and they win.<br>
In some cases it is not possible to play your own game exclusively.  For example, a great match-up of profit vs. court.  In this case, the profit deck is forced to play a game that is dictated as much by the court deck as by his/her own.  This situation still calls for the basic mission of the deck.  If the profit player starts playing a game to keep the court from getting captives, then the profit player has forfeit his/her strength.	If the profit player simply sticks to his/her own game and worry about the plan that has already been established before the game began then s/he has a chance of winning.  This type of game is particularly difficult to stay with your own game.  It is very tempting to focus on disruption rather than the purpose of the deck, direct damage and drains (in most cases).<br>
If you focus on playing your own game rather than your opponent&amp;#8217;s you will find yourself at an amazing advantage.  It is this skill that separates the beginner from the experienced player.<br>
