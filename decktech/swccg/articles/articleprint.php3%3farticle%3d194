In this article I will examine the ways you can counter the Manipulation of the Dark Side or at least slow it down.<br>
<br>
-Concept : Manipulation is meant to beat the player , not the deck.<br>
<br>
I truely believe that manipulation is meant to beat the player by annoying them over and over again until they become so frustrated that they make a game ending mistake or just basically give up.<br>
<br>
-Side note : Personal Experience - I've actually only used Manipulation in playtesting and some other things because it isn't really my style. Its a pretty tough deck to play because you have to guess what the opponent is gonna do to make it effective. I only got Manipulation to be perfect in one game. Kal Faln'l C'ndros was the only character to hit the table and that was only because Ability Ability Ability was eating him alive. KFC was payed a visit by Vader , his stick , and Tarkin next turn and wiped up for a nice chunk of damage , win by 35. Manip is a tough deck to play and it can't battle good enough for me.<br>
<br>
Light Side Counter Measures :<br>
<br>
a. What're You Tryin' To Push On Us ? ( WYTTPOU?) - I mean really man , Scanning Crew ; how lame can you be. This card can grapple the good recycling Manip Interrupts like A Dangerous Time , Scanning Crew , Masterful Move , Sabaac,  and Voyeur. 1 to 3 of these help your deck against Manipulation and give you maximum flexibility against other decktypes.<br>
<br>
b.Tunnel Vision - This card should already be in your deck but if you don't have it this is a good excuse to get it in. Basically cancels the effect of A Dangerous Time and lets you go grab a card they were trying to hide from you. 2 to 3 of these in a deck really speed your deck up and helps offset Manipulation.<br>
<br>
c.Shocking Information ( SInfo ) - Ah yes , destiny recycler ; also stops Manip. This baby puts the hurt on the opponent by making them lose 4 force plus the card that is making the scam , I mean Scan . Hmm I get to recycle a 5 destiny while they lose 5 force ( about 8% of their deck a pop ). Side benefit of this card is that it recycles very easily and is a solid	destiny. Bad thing is that if the opponent uses Hell2Pay this will be the first thing they grapple. 2-3 of these will make your fighting forces better and keep you safe from Manip.<br>
<br>
d. - It's A Hit ! - Lost Function cancels Scanning Crew and a gazillion other things. This will probably be used in a Hidden Base deck and might be able to keep Captain Han in your hand to deliver a death strike to their small fleet. Not a very effective counter in itself ( against Manipulation that is ).<br>
<br>
e. -Sense/Alter - Sense and Alter haven't seen much play lately but against weaker forms of Manip , where Manip is a sidetheme , you can probably Sense and Alter away interrupts and Effects at key times like Sensing a Scanning Crew or A Dangerous Time to break the 'lock' they've been keeping all game long. Usually isn't very effective against Manipulation because they use There is No Try and/or Oppressive Enforcement.<br>
<br>
 f. - Tawss Khaa - Eh ? Why is SHE on here ? Well lets see. She is an Alien so she can't be Scanning Crewed or hurt by Ralltiir Ops deploy bonus , she is FEMALE so she can't be Mi'oom Onith'ed , She isn't a main character so she can't be affected by Bad Feeling Have I , she can draw destiny by herself ,	AND has a high enough ability to use Sense and Alter. Any deck that considers itself to have a good ground pound will use this lovely lady.<br>
<br>
g. - Corporal Beezer - protects Endor Mains and Rebel scrubs from Manipulation , again not very effective and won't really save you a game versus Manipulation.<br>
<br>
h. - Goo Nee Tay - Aside from cancelling Mi'oom Onith's Game Text you get to make the opponent's characters of ability &gt; 2 deploy for +2 . Many Manipulation decks will use good destiny drawing characters like Vader , Zuckuss , and others of that kind so that if they slip a turn they'll have a destiny draw to knock out whatever is left. The deploy +2 will probaby hit every single character in their deck except maybe Khurgee or  Elsek or someone of that nature. TDIGWATT / PIDAIFurther takes a little bit of the effectiveness away from Goo Nee Tay but since HDADTJ is so popular this card should still have a slot in your deck.<br>
<br>
i. - Scrambled Transmission ( Scrambled T ) - Did someone say Anti-manipulation ? This card basically destroys it by itself.  Grab a Shocking Info , and makes ADT , Voyeur , and other cards like that all Lost Interrupts really hurts their effectiveness unless they have a really really good retrieval base. Problem with this card is that it is hard to identify Manipulation decks from the get go , bonus side is that you can continually recyle Shocking Info , look for it again , and if you know your deck good you'll know where every single card in the deck is and when you wanna draw/deploy against other decktypes.<br>
<br>
j. - How Did We Get Into This Mess ?(HDWGITM) - One way to undo the Manip they are doing is to Manip yourself back into a normal state ;) Oh you Scanning Crewed Obi ? HDWGITM , HDWGITM , HDWGITM , HDWGITM , and pop Obi's back into hand ;) side bonus is that it gets your deck up quickly. Backlash is that you have to use Droids and might be vulnerable to Monnok early .<br>
<br>
k. - Descent Into the Dark -  This is a Voyeur killer pure and simple. This is also good for Beatdown and HDWGITM.<br>
<br>
l. - Control - Manipulation decks are noterious for dealing damage slowly. Canceling any sizeable force drains they get before you can get characters up is good. This is a pretty good card but canceling force drains is starting to get built into a lot of objectives.<br>
<br>
m. - Battle Plan - Making them fulfill both a battleground System and a battleground site is a huge blow to manipulation. The only problem with this card against Manip is that it'll take yourself awhile to fulfill the ground portion of it.<br>
<br>
n. - Order to Engage / Anger Fear Aggression / Draw Their Fire - Manipulation decks are really bad about battling. AFA can deal damage even if they manip you. Forcing them to battle or striking into them will cause major problems for their deck when about 8-20 cards of their deck is red. These all have good uses in normal decks.<br>
<br>
o. Civil Disorder - Again most Manip decks are heavy on the red and playing Scanning Crew every turn and running the normal Manip procedures costs a lot of force. Making them throw out ability every turn really complicates things and manipulates their deck ;)<br>
<br>
p. Yargna/Cyborg Construct - As long as your hand size stays down , it'll protect things versus Monnok. Really only good for non-unique decks.<br>
<br>
All these cards can be solid Manipulation protection , the more you use the better off you'll be. The good thing is that most of these cards can seemlessly blend into a deck and give you good Manipulation protection. Other possible counters to Manipulation are decktypes : use your own manipulator or use a deck with a bunch of aliens and uniqu stuff. The best counter to manipulation , however , isn't a card ; it's a mindset ( Patience ). Next time I'll talk about what the Dark Side can use to offset the Rogue Light Side Manipulation decks ( Oola ).<br>
