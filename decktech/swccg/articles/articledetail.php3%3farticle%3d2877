<br>
About a month ago I posted an article on Decktech entitled &quot;How SWCCG has been Revived in Michigan&quot;.  Now, I truly was thinking that when I wrote that article that we had revolutionized the game of SWCCG in Michigan. I had no idea how much of an impact our little league would have on the playing scene in Michigan.  <br>
<br>
Here is the background information: I had become increasingly frustrated with my player base because of low turnouts. I had tried running tournaments in nearly every city in Michigan, including Canton, Garden City, Lapeer, Novi, Northville, Pontiac and Ann Arbor.  In May everything came to a head when only 2 players showed up for one of my tournaments.  I decided I wouldn&#146;t run my required monthly tournament for June while I contemplated what to do about the situation.  I was at a loss, and even considered resigning from my post as a squadron member. But I loved the game, and I loved spending time with my players too much.<br>
<br>
My primary concern for a long time had been that there are over 800 players who at one time or another have played in SWCCG tournaments, but 45% of them had failed to play more than 6 tournament games.  This led me to the conclusion that we alienate many of our players and fail to encourage them to continue playing.<br>
<br>
I had tried many different ideas to lure players. Here are some of them: entry fees to bolster prize support seemed to hold the interest of some of the players, but players who fared poorly would often fail to ever attend another event. I tried giving out extra &quot;consolation&quot; prizes to players who didn&#146;t win any games. You name it, and I probably tried it.<br>
<br>
I finally decided that I would run weekly tournaments. The league was not an immediate success, as only 8 players showed up.  I was just thrilled that we were sanctioned. The key project for the next week would be to contact players and make them aware of the weekly league. I ran through Decipher&#146;s ratings lists for Corellia and obtained information on every SWCCg player in Michigan including the city they lived in. Then I sorted this list to find players who were local to the Livonia area. Then I started hitting the online phonebooks looking for phone numbers for these guys. I would sometimes have to call 8 or 9 people with the same last name before finally stumbling across the right phone number. The trick worked, because we drew 23 players out the following week.<br>
<br>
The next issue was player retention. I knew that there were 40 players in Livonia.  I figured excellent prize support that everyone would have a chance to win would help to keep people coming back.  I convinced the RIW Hobbies store owner to give me an Emperor Palpatine to give away to the league winner. I decided that the league winner could not be determined simply based upon wins or winning percentage, but should take into consideration games played.  The store owner was thrilled about the plan to reward players for simply coming.  So here was what we came up with: we gave 2 pts. per game played, plus an additional pt. for each game won.  When attendance hit 23 that second week, Pam (the owner) gave me a Clash of Sabers foil to give away as second prize at the end of the summer league.  I knew that league prizes would help to get players coming back, but I needed something else. I wanted my players to feel like they had a chacne to compete for a prize every week.  <br>
<br>
My initial solution to this problem was to give out prizes to players based upon rating.  I gave out a prize to the top player under 1800, 1600 and 1400 in addition to the winner.  When my tournaments started exceeding  25 players, I gave out an under 1500 prize as well.  I implemented this method of giving prize support, taking foils from my collection and giving them away. Occasionally I would have to trade for a foil to give away, only to have the person who I got it from win it.<br>
<br>
When I wrote my article in August I reported that our average attendance was 20.5.  I saw a great potential now that we had made the player base aware that we were playing on a weekly basis. Players no longer took month long breaks from the game. Players didn&#146;t have dust on their cards, and they were constantly getting new ideas for decks from their opponents.  I was excited for the future of our game and so we were they.<br>
<br>
Phase 2: Then I came up with Phase 2.<br>
<br>
Phase 2 of SWCCG revival was to empower the players.  I was only one man who was seemingly working alone to build up a community of SWCCG players. In early September I gained employment and I no longer had the time to recruit players like I once had.  I needed help. Here is the idea I came up with:<br>
<br>
I decided to give away a box of Coruscant if the players could get 30 players to show up. This carrot worked well, as some players would start bringing a friend or 2. However, I knew that most of my players realized the mathematical odds of winning the box was small.  They needed more incentive to bring somebody with them.<br>
<br>
The next step was to offer to give a pack of cards to anybody who brought 2 players with them.  This idea has produced awe-inspiring results. One guy brought 4 players last week, and this week three players brough at least 2 players with them.  I lost 3 packs of cards, but the attendance was overwhelming. We totaled 36 players for a 4 game local tournament.<br>
<br>
In the 12 weeks since the inception of the original Summer League and the follow-up Fall League we have seen a total of 80 different players participate. The percentage of players in Michigan who have played 6 games or less has fallen to 42%. Meanwhile, the average attendance for our 4 tournaments in September was 27.5 players per week. This is up considerably from the 16.7 that we drew per tournament in July.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, these tournaments now cost me 2-5 packs of cards per week, and 3-4 foils out of my personal collection. I never would have guessed that is all it would take us to average 27 players, but for me and my players it is a small price to pay for the quality of tournaments we now have!<br>
