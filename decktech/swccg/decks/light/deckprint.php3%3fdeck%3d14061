<br>
My bad that lower part wasn`t updated as this deck is similar to my last deck. (Hidden Base B0 wings)So just put a 3-5 B- wing Squadrons here and there to really hurt your opponent. <br>
<br>
Why the Forest? <br>
<br>
That idea I got from other deck I looked at, just put Luke and Obi their and then let his guys come to you as that way you take no damage from Bring Him Before Me, as Luke will be at a battle ground site. <br>
<br>
Why onyl one Admirals Orders? <br>
<br>
Well, you only need one as you will have to wait a while before you get it out and with the other cards like All- Wings report in and Slayn &amp; Korpil Facilities, you will just get any lost force back. <br>
<br>
Why 5 intruder missiles? <br>
<br>
Besides for use in combat and getting back lost force, they can also be used as destiny! <br>
<br>
Why traffic control? <br>
<br>
Before you are about to win, return all the in needed cards in your hand to your used pile, as to increase your margin or victory! <br>
<br>
The rest of the deck is pretty self explanitory. <br>
<br>
For battles, jut leave your bomber in groups of 5-6 with 1-2 bombers in each group armed with missiles. With more than 8 Bombers out, you will have no trouble getting lost force back with All- wings Report in as there win`t be any number higher than 7 in your deck! <br>
<br>
Please give me some good reviews and feel free to give me some ideas on how to improve this deck. <br>
<br>
Thanks <br>
