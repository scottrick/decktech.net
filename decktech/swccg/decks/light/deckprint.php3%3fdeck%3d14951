It&#146;s still winnable, but a bad matchup nonetheless. But it&#146;s not popular in my area, hence the reason I don&#146;t meta for it. If it&#146;s popular in YOUR area, then just add the cards in. I mentioned a couple, including Theron&#146;s ship + cannon, I Hope She&#146;s Alright, and A Few Manuevers. <br>
<br>
My first attempt at a WYS deck, but definitely my best. Lost 3 times total. All 3 times were against people that knew my deck card for card, and had built their own versions of it. I’m not going to go through who it beat, but it’s done very well, helping to win me a Playstation 2. Enough bullShit.<br>
<br>
This deck is slower to set up than most WYS decks, but is a monster once it gets going. First thing is to set up the Super Falcon (Captain Han, Melas, and the Falcon) at Tatooine. Use Squadron Assignments to pull out the other parts, and track those parts through your deck using Insurrection to check your reserve deck. Use the Tunnel Visions if you have to. DO NOT go half-assed in space. Complete the Super Falcon unless you’re in deep Shit and need to hurry. Then set up on ground with Jedi Luke (hopefully with Saber) and support characters, most important being Chewie and Lando. But you could use anybody, just make sure you lock down the site first turn you deploy. With this on the table, you have Menace Fades in effect, and Battle Plan if you have drawn it. From here you can set up Celebration, the Cantina shuffle (which is muy importante) and I’ll Take the Leader. Now you can react to your opponent, and take him out with your power and wide variety of interrupts. The destiny is fabulous as well, with around 30+ being 4 or higher. <br>
<br>
As for some certain card choices, here you go:<br>
<br>
Choke: Great for anti swarm decks (mainly Skrillings). Also useful for annoying aliens like Boelo, Ephant Mon, Mighty Jabba, etc. Can be played from Lost Pile.<br>
<br>
Run Luke Run x2: Stops HuntDown in it’s tracks. No dueling period. Also can be used to set up beatdown on unsuspecting opponent. 6 destiny.<br>
<br>
Surprise Assault: Can be played twice for big damage. Very high destiny in deck. Wrecks a MKOS or Court deck which doesn’t have Hutt Influence out yet. Beats on TIEs. Great card in general.<br>
<br>
Mos Eisley x2: Cantina Shuffle is so important. More drains, more retrieval (Celebration), and can be used to set up the beatdown. Current record is Palpatine and 21 force after Janus was Messed and Vader Disarmed and Clashed. That’s the one turn win.<br>
<br>
Only two ships?: They lock the system. 3 destiny and basically 20 power with Outrider’s gametext. Tons of forfeit as well. Can send empty ship to docking bay with I’ll Take the Leader. So good. Add in Bantha droid if space is big in your area. It isn’t in mine.<br>
<br>
Maybe some matchups now:<br>
<br>
vs MKOS: Good matchup because of 3 things: Celebration, Menace Fades, and Battle Plan. They have to get a god draw to your Shit draw to kick you out of space. You can clean up on ground with all your tricks and battle evasion. You shut down their drains while you use yours. Easy game.<br>
<br>
vs HuntDown: Run Luke Run stops the duel, the combo card stops Visage. You have to play smart though. Don’t let the early pressure get to you. Rely on your retrival to help you out and set up at your pace. Do NOT deploy Jedi Luke unless you have Run Luke Run. You don’t need to take chances, and I learned this the hard way. Be patient, play your game, and this isn’t too hard.<br>
<br>
vs BHBM: That’s why Scout Luke is in there. This takes away some of your tricks, but you can still Disarmed and Mess with Lando. Harder game than HuntDown, but winnable. Space will be key here, since you will need Celebration and Battle Plan. Be careful of losing battles, so pick and choose. You can with this deck normally. Use retrival wisely, and win.<br>
<br>
vs TIEs: This is the @#$% matchup. Either Tallon Rolls or Cannons, both hurt. This isn’t big around me, but it hurts. Might want to add Red (whatever Theron’s ship is) with Cannon to help this. Also I Hope She’s Alright since you will control ground. Tough game overall, and probably the worst matchup. You have to be prepared if you think you’ll see it.<br>
<br>
That’s about all I can think of for now. Play the deck, and have fun with it. Be patient, and you’ll do well. Enjoy.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
