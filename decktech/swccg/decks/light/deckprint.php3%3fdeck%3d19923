<br>
All right, before I begin, I must address the number one concern on everybody&#146;s mind regarding WYS: A Useless Gesture.  It is not a magic bullet for WYS.  It just makes the interrupts less abusive…nothing more.  So, before you review, I implore you: Be intelligent: DO NOT SAY A USELESS GESTURE KILLS WYS!  If you do honestly believe that, all I ask is that you support your argument.  I have made a case, and will continue to make a case to the contrary.  To that ends, please read my article, &quot;Mark Twain Was A Smuggler&quot;.  It is an important supplement to this deck&#146;s strategy, and it thoroughly details why WYS is still a viable deck type in the Post R3 environment.<br>
<br>
Now, some of you are wondering, &quot;Why WYS?&quot;  Yes, it&#146;s true that, with R3 on the shelves, there are more counters for WYS than any other deck in the environment.  This makes taking WYS to a tournament like running a gauntlet.  However, no deck is as well equipped to run that gauntlet as WYS.  There is a reason that there are counters, and more counters, to WYS.  It is the best deck LS has to offer.  And as such, it needs to always be considered.<br>
<br>
This is your typical SOLID WYS deck.  Its focus is to create damage by wearing down my opponent&#146;s character base, by force choking, and in general just laying the hammer down.  It has some nasty damage potential (if it gets going, I can easily set up 7-damage a turn), and it has some powerful battling capabilities.  If you play it right, WYS has the capability to win any match-up you face it with.  Let&#146;s take a look at a typical game . . . <br>
<br>
THE START<br>
<br>
Always start Insurrection &amp; Aim High and Squadron Assignments.  The third effect varies, but mostly it will be Another Pathetic Lifeform for some extra activation.  However, if your opponent starts YCHF or Mobilization Points, start Don&#146;t Do That Again.  If you started DDTA, pull Legendary Starfighter.  If your opponent starts TDIGWATT or ISB, start Menace Fades.<br>
<br>
EARLY GAME<br>
<br>
Pull your docking bays and Kessel.  Hold on to Kessel until you&#146;re ready to drain there.  You&#146;re going to start the game playing reactively, using those extra destinies to clear sites.  Set up in space, so that you can set up Menace Fades and Battle Plan.  Get Goo Nee Tay out as early as possible.  Flip by turn 3.<br>
<br>
MID GAME<br>
<br>
You occupy a site (preferably the Cantina); you occupy a system (preferably Kessel).  You&#146;ve pulled your Battle Plan shield to force your opponent to go to space.  You use that leverage to set up Legendary Starfighter.  Then, with your multiple destinies, you take down one of their starships with ease.  Clear the system and pop Legendary Starfighter on the Falcon.  On the ground, you&#146;re clearing any opponent&#146;s sites with a couple of smugglers…or you&#146;re protecting Luke with a couple of smugglers, so that he can drain with ease.  You&#146;re taking the battle to both ground and space.<br>
<br>
LATE GAME<br>
<br>
After you set up Legendary Starfighter, you should have cleared that system, so your opponent shouldn&#146;t be able to satisfy the plan.  They&#146;re not activating much.  They&#146;re paying extra for characters.  They&#146;re paying extra for drains.  You&#146;re draining for free…and you&#146;re dealing 7 force loss a turn.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this deck has a simple strategy for easy wins . . . and it doesn&#146;t rely on interrupts from the lost pile.  If you&#146;re fortunate enough to repeat interrupts from the lost pile, and you usually can repeat at least one, it&#146;s just adding insult to injury.  WYS is still the best deck in the LS&#146;s bag.<br>
<br>
THE ANTI-CARDS<br>
<br>
Now, normally, people like to talk about their card selections in their deck.  Well, if you look through this deck, I think it&#146;s pretty straightforward.  6 characters to circumvent Maul, some strong space power, some strong ground power, Legendary Starfighter, Goo Nee Tay, Battle Plan, high destinies, and a lot of multi-purpose interrupts.  The deck is solid, and I don&#146;t see a lot of need for explanation.  However, if you don&#146;t understand a card choice, d-mail me and I&#146;ll do my best to explain it.  So, that said, I wanted to spend this section of my strategy discussing the many counters to WYS.<br>
<br>
Tatooine Maul: I have 6 characters that will activate my smugglers.  Build up a bit of a power base . . . then activate them and battle for an epic Maul beat-down.  You say Tatooine Maul . . . I say no problem!<br>
<br>
His Name is Anakin: Okay, so my aliens deploy +1 to Tatooine sites.  I don&#146;t have any non-uniques, and they&#146;re cheap any ways.  The worst thing this can do is slow me down a turn, because I&#146;ll deploy to the Home One Docking Bay instead of Tatooine.  Not a problem.<br>
<br>
My Lord Is That Legal: Senate decks spend lots of force.  So, if I get Battle Plan and Goo Nee Tay working, my opponent won&#146;t be able to pay to do everything they want to do.  Then, towards the end of the game, a couple of well-timed smugglers (and well tracked 6s) clear the senate to pave the way to victory.<br>
<br>
Guri: She can only hold one location.  And if that location is a system, you can circumvent her text with Darklighter Spin.<br>
<br>
Hell to Pay / SSPFT / DTHACC: My interrupts are here for utility.  I don&#146;t expect them to play repeatedly.  If my opponent wants to grab one, I&#146;ll let him.  It really doesn&#146;t affect me.  And all DTHACC can do is stop me from retrieving 1 force (unless my opponent has played First Strike).<br>
<br>
Space Decks: Can be a little bit of trouble, but still very beatable.  They&#146;re going to start Mob Points.  You start DDTA.  Instead of your usual strategy of trying to own space, you alter your perspective and try to claim the ground (That&#146;s the beauty of a balanced deck . . . you can do that), and when you&#146;re ready, you take to the skies, kill some ships, play Legendary Starfighter, play Battle Plan, turn the corner, and report your victory.<br>
<br>
Court:  Can be a little bit of a nuisance, but it&#146;s not a problem.  Just be sure that you have 7 ability when you take to the skies.<br>
<br>
And finally . . . the card that everybody is concerned about . . . <br>
<br>
A Useless Gesture:  Your lost pile becomes a display case for your interrupt options.  If you get force drained, toss a lost interrupt or two (with the possible exceptions of Resilience and RLR).  Look for the Edges to hit your lost pile, then use those 6s to retrieve a few.  AUG will alter your strategy a little . . . but it should never beat you, by itself.  A Useless Gesture?  A Useless Gesture, indeed!<br>
<br>
So, as you can see, the counters don&#146;t counter as well as you would like to believe . . . WYS is still the best there is.<br>
<br>
MATCH-UPS<br>
<br>
Vs. Hunt Down: Use Resilience and RLR to protect Luke from a duel.  You can also track destinies to win the duel.  Trans. Terminated the Visage.  OoC Vader.  Play Goo Nee Tay and Battle Plan to completely force choke your opponent.<br>
<br>
Vs. Watto: Save 2 . . . but then lose it anyway (well, mix it up a little bit).  Deploy the Mos Espa DB between Mos Espa and the Junkyard to slow everything down.  Can be a tough game, but if you play intelligently, you&#146;ll win.<br>
<br>
Vs. Black Sun: I don&#146;t see this deck around anymore . . . however I play it, so let me just say that this is a VERY tough match.  It will be a close game.  Set up Battle Plan, Goo Nee Tay, and Legendary Starfighter and the odds are in your favor.  Just do whatever possible to protect Luke.<br>
<br>
Vs. Lightsaber Combat: Alright, you don&#146;t need Luke to win.  So, keep him as a late game option to disrupt your opponent&#146;s drains . . . that is if you&#146;re feeling daring.  Otherwise, look at what you have and what they have.  You have drains at Kessel, the Cantina, and probably a docking bay for 6 force.  That sets up Ultimatum, Battle Plan, and Menace Fades.  Therefore, you should only be losing 4 force a turn to their drains.  Your high forfeit should mean that you don&#146;t lose a lot of characters to battles, but even if you do, you&#146;ve still got retrieval.  It&#146;s not the most fun, because it will tend to be non-interactive, but that&#146;s what you have to do to win.<br>
<br>
Vs. Other decks just play your game.  7 damage, 2+ destinies, force choke, and retrieval is a lot for any DS to handle in one game.  WYS forever!<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, I&#146;d be happy to answer them for you.  Just d-mail me.  Otherwise, enjoy!<br>
