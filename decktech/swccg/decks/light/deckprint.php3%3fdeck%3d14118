me just say that I&#146;m entering it here mainly<br>
so I can access it myself in the future. I&#146;ve<br>
played this deck through 5 or 6 tournaments and<br>
for numerous other fun games. There have been a<br>
couple of minor tweaks here and there, but the<br>
deck has been, for the most part, unchanged<br>
throughout. It has an excellent track record,<br>
but, more importantly, it&#146;s fun to play, and<br>
that&#146;s why I&#146;m posting it here before I tear it<br>
apart to build new decks.<br>
<br>
I built this after I went 1-2 with a Jedi<br>
Training deck at a tournament (obviously, that<br>
wasn&#146;t going to cut it) and decided that I was<br>
done with Jedi Training for a long time. I then<br>
reflected upon what it was that made Jedi<br>
Training so much fun for me (when it worked<br>
well), and I came up with the following answers:<br>
1) It shuts down drain bonuses, 2) It sets up<br>
a permanent high destiny, and 3) I get to<br>
retrieve force. Well, apart from the<br>
cancellation of drain bonuses, this deck does<br>
the same thing... only faster. And at the speed<br>
this deck moves, it cancels drains by killing<br>
the characters your opponent can use to drain.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the destiny of this deck. After<br>
the 10 starting cards (start Wise Advice instead<br>
of Staging Areas if you suspect SAC), you will<br>
have 23 cards at 5 destiny or higher, 14 of<br>
which are 6 or higher. Nothing ought to be<br>
immune to your battle destinies.<br>
<br>
There are two basic game plans, and they work<br>
as follows. The first game plan takes effect if<br>
your opponent captures Luke with Vader; win 3<br>
battles or duels, and turn him to the light<br>
side. In the second game plan (mainly against<br>
Scum or Ties), set up your Mega-Activation and<br>
Mega-Destiny to cause Mega-Attrition with beat-<br>
down squads that whup your opponents and control<br>
locations. (However, be careful of Ties with<br>
Lasers.) In the second game plan, Rebel Scout<br>
Luke is monster. Immune to Always Thinking With<br>
Your Stomach, he&#146;s a drain of 2 on the second<br>
turn and activating 5 at the Landing Platform.<br>
If your opponent tries to battle Luke, a Fallen<br>
Portal can take out 2 characters, a Clash can<br>
take out another, Swing and Chop a 3rd, and kill<br>
their destiny with Insertion Planning. Luke<br>
lives. Kills Scum Dead.<br>
<br>
Match-ups for the Masses:<br>
<br>
Vs BHBM.<br>
A very strategic game. You&#146;re giving them Luke<br>
right away, so this kills your activation for<br>
a couple of turns. Eat the force loss, and save<br>
for strategic battles. Try not to grin if your<br>
opponent considers dueling. Move Vader to the<br>
Throne Room (oops! no more Vader). Try not to<br>
look at Vader too much to indicate that you&#146;re<br>
about to kick his @rse with Obi w/Saber, random<br>
spy, and Chewbacca, etc... Get 3 on I Feel the<br>
Conflict, turn Vader.<br>
<br>
Vs Scum.<br>
Thank your opponent for the activation. Use your<br>
&lt;&gt; DB judiciously. Control the sites he wants to<br>
control. I wanted to fit Aim High in the deck,<br>
but the destiny sucks. Solo with Chewie (or a<br>
scout at an exterior stie) will take care of<br>
their destiny. Use Insertion Planning and Fallen<br>
Portal. On the Edges will keep retrieval even.<br>
You have better destiny and will cause them to<br>
forfeit everything every battle. Luke will drain<br>
like a monster for 3 every turn at the Back Door.<br>
Battle Plan could be used if you get early air<br>
supremecy. (Watch out for the Rancor; don&#146;t<br>
deploy to the Rancor pit to attack it, you might<br>
just draw bad destiny--see &quot;Scrubbing Out<br>
Hardcore&quot; in my tourney reports for more info...)<br>
<br>
Vs Ties.<br>
One of the (non-tournament) losses I suffered<br>
was to Ravelling&#146;s Tie deck because I played<br>
like a monkey. My advice: don&#146;t play like a<br>
monkey. Get Battle Plan out at the first<br>
opportunity and turn the game into a drain<br>
race. Their early drain cancellation will be<br>
a pain, but who cares? Eventually they will<br>
deploy all their Ties, and you will *still* be<br>
retrieving your On the Edges. You get much<br>
more force early on, and this is the one real<br>
chance you have to use Shocking Info for that<br>
other ability--you know, the one that cancels<br>
a scomp link... That&#146;s right, Mr. Merrejk!<br>
Wait to go into space until you&#146;ve determined<br>
that they don&#146;t have those nasty lasers, or<br>
that they&#146;re starting to get low on force.<br>
<br>
Vs Hunt Down.<br>
Make them lose a couple Vaders with Han/Chewie,<br>
Wedge/Corran Horn, Blount/Cracken, and stack<br>
cards at the same time. Don&#146;t deploy Obi<br>
against Vader if your opponent has been <br>
tracking dueling destiny or if you&#146;re unsure<br>
if he has a dueling destiny-adder in his hand.<br>
Deploy Obi where Vader can&#146;t reach him, or<br>
wait until you&#146;ve gotten a favorable peek at<br>
his destiny. You&#146;re going to suffer early<br>
force loss, again, against a Hunt Down deck,<br>
but attrition and On the Edge will wear them<br>
out later on.<br>
<br>
Vs Stupid Decks.<br>
Use Insight and Battle Plan and On the Edge to<br>
beat stupid decks. Use Luke w/Saber if they&#146;re<br>
playing a stupid deck without Imperials. You&#146;ve<br>
got Blount if they&#146;ve got a stupid deck that<br>
has ISB in its Lore.<br>
<br>
Remember, Star Wars CCG can be fun. Enjoy.<br>
