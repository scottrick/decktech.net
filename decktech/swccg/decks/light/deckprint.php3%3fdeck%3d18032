First of all its racing, which is very important.  Why race?  Two reasons.  1st: It forces the opponent to work for the race and 2nd: I did it!  In my opinion it is the best card in the game.  Forcing the opponent to not save force, or loose force and has built in retrieval is very very big!<br>
<br>
Strategy:  Play the race and win.  You really don&#8217;t need to do much - except play off of the opponent.  If they are activating too much, then speed flip and carry Barrier, dodge, or ICW.  After that you simply out-play (yes the deck doen&#8217;t do it for you... well yes it does!) your opponent.  The destinies are very good and with your direct damage - Anger, Fear Aggressions - Odds - I did it! - and with the power of It can wait (thank you kyle craft!!!) you force the opponent into fighting battles they don&#8217;t want and gives you an entrance to easy victories.  Not to mention the steady retrieval.<br>
<br>
As for the start?  Most of the time I start Insurrection to stop Ellis, pull my db, and give a forfeit bonus.  Against a speed deal deck i would prolly start Menace fades to cancel their bonuses.<br>
<br>
The destinies are solid - you have plenty of forfeit and ways of dealing damage.  You can fight off any deck - there is no auto loss.  And you should win the race everytime.  Any questions? D-Mail me.<br>
