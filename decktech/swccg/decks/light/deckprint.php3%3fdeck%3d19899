Reflections 3 has really made this deck super powerful. In choosing your remaining Defensive Shields, only put in Aim High if you do not have the Insurrection &amp; Aim High combo effect (Insurrection is a common). And do not forget, Defensive Shields can played pretty much anytime, so, do not pull out Planetary Defenses until you see a TIE Bomber deploy. Play Ultimatum when you are well grounded. Ultimatum will pretty much ruin Dark Deal decks, Walker Garrison decks, and most any other draining decks.<br>
<br>
Okay, here&#146;s how things work. Before doing anything, make every effort to deploy Tessek and Kabe to the Audience Chamber when Bo Shuda is there. The numerous copies of those characters and the two You Will Take Me To Jabba Nows should make this relatively easy. On your first turn, deploy Bo Shuda from Reserve Deck using the Audience Chamber game text. Then, deploy Home One Docking Bay from Reserve Deck using Insurrection. On your second turn, deploy either of the Tatooine docking bays (aim for Docking Bay 94 so Blast The Door, Kid! will function). Once Tessek and Kabe are at the Audience Chamber, you are ready to work your wonders!<br>
<br>
You may be asking, &quot;what is with the Home One Docking Bay?&quot; Well, first off, it is another location that is great for Fallen Portal. Second, if the opponent rudely deploys His Name His Anakin, you need this non-Tatooine location to deploy Chadra-Fans. With Tessek at the Audience Chamber, your Chadra-Fans deploy for one force. You can get around His Name Is Anakin by deploying to the Home One Docking Bay and then shipping them off (for free) to the various Tatooine docking bays. The Spaceport Docking Bay serves a couple of functions. If the opponent functions on some remote planet, you want a way to get there. If most of the action is on Tatooine, just deploy it there. If you are worried about the opponent playing on Cloud City, replace the Cantina with Cloud City Platform.<br>
<br>
Here is where this deck&#146;s brutality kicks in. By spreading across the many docking bays, Fallen Portal is on standby. Fallen Portal is EXTREMELY lethal because a very LARGE quantity of this deck is destiny 4 or higher. So, that means, you can target a defense value of five and almost never miss. Tessek adds one to Force drains where you have a Chadra-Fan. Considering how Fallen Portal requires the opponent to initiate, if you manage to pull Order To Engage into hand and then deploy it, the opponent has to choose to either initiate and be crushed or lose three force. This works even at the Audience Chamber, regardless of the fact that the opponent cannot initiate battles.<br>
<br>
Rennek will protect the Audience Chamber from creature attacks. If the opponent is using a Trap Door deck, simply use Fallen Portal on the Rancor (it is defense value five...easy kill). Do not forget to retrieve one Chadra-Fan per turn (after flipping the objective). Use Choke to either prevent attrition from infecting your Chadra-Fans or to cancel Ephant Mon&#146;s game text (Ephant Mon prevents thieves from deploying to his location). With the crazy number of Chadra-Fans running around, Nar Shadda Wind Chimes can really save your hide. Once you have used up the &quot;once per game&quot; function on that card, simply use it to pull Chadra-Fans.<br>
<br>
Do not worry about decks based on No Money, No Parts, No Deal! Just save up eight force, pay it, and send Watto away. Chadra-Fans are cheap so you are not losing much. Plus, with the aid of Staging Areas, all of those docking bays you occupy are generating tons of force. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
