On the first turn I grab Lando and the Falcon and deploy Kessel, hopefully I can get a drain or two in there before the enemy has time to react. <br>
Second turn I pull Endor so that the enemy gets no more force from me. It doesn&#146;t matter what order I pull the other three in, but I&#146;ll have them all out and flip on turn 5. <br>
From there, all I have to do is play it based on what I&#146;m up against. As you can see, I can&#146;t lose if they try to fight me. And if they ignore, I ignore. The five weapon carriers are there if I need to go on a suicide run, otherwise they just sit at my DBs so I have the benefit of Menace Fades. Luke can also fly Red 5 if he isn&#146;t needed on the ground. <br>
One of my favorite things about this deck is that it&#146;s so efficent with force. I&#146;m generating more than I need by turn 3, and I usually stockpile a few just in case. The most expensive matched pairs in here are Han &amp; the Falcon and Dash &amp; the Outrider, both of which cost only 5 at Rendevous Point. <br>
If I do get a fight and I&#146;m overwhelmed, I can still jump around and get in a few drains each turn. The one other thing I should mention here is the &quot;Trap Theory&quot; in my choice of planets. Here are the parsec numbers:<br>
<br>
Coruscant: 0<br>
Kiffex: 2<br>
Sullust: 7<br>
Endor: 8 <br>
Kessel: 8<br>
<br>
There is a gap of 5 between the first two and the latter three. All my ships except Gold Squadron 1 and Blue Squadron 5 can move that far, but very few DS ships exist that have that much hyperdrive. So, I can pin the enemy down on one end or the other and smash them nicely OR retreat the other end (which I&#146;ve never had to do).<br>
<br>
There you have it. Thank you for your time and God bless.   <br>
