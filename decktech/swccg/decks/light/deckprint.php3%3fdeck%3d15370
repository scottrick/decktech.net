To Chessmaster:<br>
If your opponent plays Operational as planned,<br>
Imperial Supply or other cards, steal this<br>
force with your Beggar to. You can play a<br>
character to another location, play OOC/TT,<br>
use Mirax` gametext or even use this one force<br>
to start your battle and don`t forget to say<br>
thank you very much...<br>
***end update 1***<br>
<br>
***update 2***<br>
to kappdendo:<br>
Do you know about playing Interrupts also from Lost Pile???<br>
I play them only ONE time. Then the match is over!!!!<br>
Same with my Admirals Order. I only need this effect in the turn I want to battle.<br>
And the Beggar is not for getting more force from my<br>
opponent, this card is only prevents my opponent playing<br>
Interrupts in battle. If he has no force activated, I don`t need this card!!! <br>
***end update 2***<br>
<br>
***update 3***<br>
swccg, please read this card again:<br>
Run Luke, Run:<br>
At any time, move Luke (for free) to a battle just initiated<br>
at an adjacent site.<br>
Luke is power +2 during that battle, unless Vader is present<br>
or adjacent to the battle site. OR You may cancel Vader`s<br>
Obsession.<br>
This means that Luke is not power +2 in a battle where Vader<br>
is present!!! That`s all. You can still play this card.<br>
***end update 3***<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the reason why Light Side ALWAYS wins.<br>
Bastian Winkelhaus (he played a very similar<br>
version) and me played three times each other <br>
at our Nationals and each game Light Side<br>
won by at least 20.<br>
<br>
The method is always the same:<br>
<br>
You start with Draw their Fire, so in a battle<br>
you initiate your opponent have to pay for each<br>
Interrupt. With Beggar he does not have any<br>
force. (Beggar cannot be canceled, Alter cannot<br>
be played because of your Objective)<br>
<br>
Deploy until you have one power less than <br>
your opponent, initiate battle and double (triple<br>
with Han) the battle damage. Play your interrupts<br>
to reduce the opponent`s Power (Blaster Prof., <br>
Power Pivot, Artoo, I`ve got..., Dash`s gametext,<br>
X-wing Laser Cannon) or to raise your Power (Run,<br>
Luke Run, Were you looking f. m. to add a destiny).<br>
So you can deal 30, 40 or more battle damage in<br>
ONE Battle. No Ghkkk.<br>
<br>
The triple card can be catched by Artoo and Cpo,<br>
the gametext of bad feeling I have is suspended.<br>
Also your Objective gives a destiny bonus for two<br>
smugglers and Mirax is very helpful for tracking.<br>
<br>
Ok, let us see how it works in gameplay:<br>
Vader at the Docking Bay. Power 6. Deploy Beggar,<br>
Han and a Raider, Luke to Cantina, battle,<br>
triple, Run Luke, Run.<br>
3 destinies for you, one for him. My total is nine,<br>
he draws a 3. My Power is 19, his power 9.<br>
30 Cards - game over.<br>
<br>
Xizor and Mighty Jabba?<br>
Beggar, Han, Lando. Battle, triple, shot<br>
Xizor, Blaster Prof. to cause to be immediately<br>
lost. Your total destiny is 6. Your Power is 13, <br>
his power is 6. Battle damage of 21.<br>
<br>
And how does it in space?<br>
Trawn, Guri, Chimaera.<br>
Dash in Outrider, Artoo and Cpo, Wedge in Red 1.<br>
Battle, double, Artoo, I`ve got a bad f.,<br>
Darklighter Spin for 6 and a tracked 5 for normal<br>
destiny, HeadingFAMF from Lost Pile. Power 24 to<br>
Power 7. Differential of 17, double is 34.<br>
Trawn, Guri and Chimaera for 24. 10 Cards more and<br>
a drain for 3 at Kessel for the rest of the game.<br>
And this was without the Cannon/Power Pivot Combo.<br>
<br>
This also works against TIE`s of any kind. They<br>
cannot use their weapons and I´ll take the leader<br>
hurts very well. With two ships you can defeat the<br>
whole Dark Side Fleet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There`s no special matchup to describe. In each<br>
game your opponent will deploy something to the<br>
space or to the ground and then you can kill him.<br>
<br>
First when you play this deck, flip with the <br>
two systems. (If you expect heavy space, go to the<br>
sites, of course)<br>
An early drain of three at Kessel (or two at cantina)<br>
will force your opponent to do something. Then draw <br>
the cards you need and wait for your beatdown. <br>
<br>
<br>
If you try to play this you have to able to track<br>
some destinies. This deck cannot win itself, you<br>
must learn how to play. It is not so easy to find<br>
the right moment to do your beatdown, and in most<br>
of the games you have only one chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here a few cards which could be the 61th card:<br>
1. Sommersault<br>
2. Slight Wpn Malf.<br>
3. Don´t get @#$%y<br>
4. Master Luke (against scum...)<br>
5. 2nd OON/TT<br>
6. 3rd Tunnel/Control<br>
7. Capt. Han<br>
8. Corran Horn (yes, for 10 Force)<br>
9. Clash of Sabers (with 2 EPP Luke, but everyone plays Crush)<br>
10. Revolution <br>
11. Ou ne ta (grrrrr)<br>
12. Your Insight serves you well <br>
