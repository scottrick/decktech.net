HuntaWarya.. well, lets see. i didnt copy your deck. this deck is based on cover landing. i told you in that d-mail that i was looking through my commons when i saw covert landing and it hit me, this deck rocks. so for all you guys out there, dont accuse me of copying @#$%, caust i didnt. (this used to be slightly more, umm, vocal, but i tuned it down since Hunter and i are cool now, later.<br>
--Loaf<br>

<br>
Warning....This is very long, and very descriptive. Definetly a grade A strategy too. Its a BOOK.<br>
<br>
This deck started out as something fresh for me to play while not using cards from other decks. Soon enough I saw how solid this deck was, even though it wasn&#8217;t meant to be.<br>
<br>
First off let me explain the basis: the ability to search for cards that search for cards (a chain) is unmattched and should be persued as an obsession. The rewards are unbeliveble!<br>
<br>
I&#8217;m going to split this into 3 sections with card by card explainations, a turn by turn explanation and finally the infamous deck match ups.<br>
<br>
<br>

Your Insight Serves You Well/Wise Advice<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The deck actually starts during the opponents turn since DS usually goes first. During the opponents turn (before your first one) use Strike Planning to pull 2 of the 3 generals. Which 2 depends on your hand. If you were lucky enough to get one in your opening hand then draw the other 2 otherwise its almost always General Crix Madine and General Solo. Now show General Solo and pull Tydirium using Squadron Assignments(during your first turn, not during your oppenents turn). Now, depending on what the opponent is playign and what they did during their turn use Your Insight Serves You Well to pull an appropriate effect. The effects to pull are as follows in order if you happen to draw them:<br>
<br>
BHBM: Start Wise Advice intead of YISYW, therefore you pull nothing.<br>
<br>
COTVG: If they dont start No Escape, pull Honor of the Jedi/Close Air Support<br>
<br>
Endor OPS: Close Air Support/<br>
<br>
HDADTJ: If they dont start No Escape, pull Honor of the Jedi/Close Air Support<br>
<br>
ISB: Close Air Support/Menace Fades<br>
<br>
MKOS: Close Air Support/Menace Fades<br>
<br>
SYCFA: Close Air Support/Menace Fades<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TURN 1:<br>
<br>
Before you activate make sure you have General Crix Madine and either General Solo/Tdirium or General Calrissian/Gold Squadron 1. If you don&#8217;t (if you forgot) get General Solo and the Tidirium. If you didn&#8217;t forget it and had all 3 generals then you can pull both ships. Howevor, this is unlikely so dont count on it. Now if the opponent gave you at least 1 force you do the following: Deploy General Crix Madine for 2 at the Rebel Landing Site. Pull either Cracken/Tala 1 or Blount/Tala 2 using General Crix Madine then Squadron Assignments depending which combination is in the reserve deck. Preferably it should be Blount/Tala 2 as Tala 2 adds 2 to the deploy of opponents spies and scouts. Now deploy the pilot/starship to Endor for 3 and deploy the Close Air Support that you pulled with YISYW. You should have at least 1 other scout in your hand and deploy that to General Crix Madine&#8217;s site for 1. Now you have established a pretty safe battleground site/system on your fiRebel Strike Team / Garrisson Destroyed turn. The opponent won&#8217;t come next turn to the Landing Site because you easily have 2 battle destinys and 1 more to power. If the opponent provided you with any extra force just draw them.<br>
<br>
Now this scenerio isn&#8217;t rare at all, the only times you cant pull it off is when the opponent is playing BHBM, HDADTJ, ISB and doesn&#8217;t play a site that gives you at least one icon. HDADTJ and ISB will most likely provide you the icon as they need battlegrounds. With BHBM you almost NEVER pull it off since you start with Wise Advice and they&#8217;ll just deploy EMatching Pilot oferor to the Death Star 2: Docking Bay, but it can happen. With COTVG and HDADTJ if they didn&#8217;t start No Escape the case is the same, but they almost always start No Escape anyway. Now if they didn&#8217;t provide you that 1 force the turn goes as follows:<br>
<br>
Pull any cards that you can but make sure you don&#8217;t deploy anything that can be lost unless you have a matching pilot and starship to Endor. Draw what you can but leave 1 force. Onto TURN 2:<br>
<br>
TURN 2:<br>
<br>
If you did get the 1 force from the opponent then do the following:<br>
<br>
As always pull anything that you can before you activate. Now you have to play your own game until you flip. Pull Chewbacca of Kasshyyyk with General Crix Madine and deploy him to the Rebel Landing site. Pull Wuta with Chewbacca and then pull either the Landing Platform or Back Door with Wuta. Deploy any ship with its matching pilot to Endor (except General Solo) and then deploy any scouts to the Landing Platform/Back Door. Deploy anything else that you can like always.<br>
<br>
If you didn&#8217;t get the 1 force than do the following:<br>
<br>
As always pull anything that you can before you activate. Now follow what you would have done for turn one if you got that 1 force. Onto TURN 3:<br>
<br>
TURN 3:<br>
<br>
If you did get the 1 force from the opponent then do the following:<br>
<br>
Pull Cracken and Tala 2 if you coudln&#8217;t deploy a starship last turn and deploy it to Endor, if you did deploy a starship then pull Major Panno to add +4 activation next turn. Pull a site with Wuta and deploy any scouts. Now you have 3 sites and have the ability to flip. If the opponent isnt on Endor then you&#8217;ll flip during your move phase. If he is then you&#8217;ll have to deploy the other site and move around untill you control 3 Endor sites. From now on you play your game as it develops. Just read your cards and don&#8217;t forget what they do.<br>
<br>
If you didn&#8217;t get the 1 force than do the following:<br>
<br>
Follow the TURN 2 outline and then on your next turn follow the TURN 3 outline.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some things to accomplish:<br>
<br>
1. Get Wuta & General Crix Madine off the Endor sites, preferably to the Home One. If you don&#8217;t draw the Home One then you can pull it with Launching the Assault.<br>
<br>
2. Deploy I&#8217;ll Take the Leader. It will make the Tydirium immune <4 and all the other ships add 2 to their immunity. When you lose one the starfighters you can relocate it to the Landing Platform and if the pilot was Cracken or Blount you can retrieve him, pull him and re-deploy him to his ship and take off back to Endor. The Landing Platform gets a +1 force drain. Finally, any ship without a pilot character is power -2. TIE&#8217;s and the Bounty Hunter ships wont be as powerful.<br>
<br>
3. Play Covert Landing. You will most likely play this card on turn 3 and later and it will break the game. You&#8217;ll have General Solo on the Tydirium and then land it to the Landing Platform or any other site that isn&#8217;t occupied by the opponet and continue to deploy up 7 scouts and their weapons to the Tydirium. All of the scouts deploy -1 and you&#8217;ll pull Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight with Luke&#8217;s Lightsaber for 4, Daughter of Skywalker with Anakin&#8217;s Lightsaber for 3, Orrimaarko for 4 and Lieutenant Page for 2 along with any 3 other scouts that deploy for 1. Move the characters out and your set. If you can&#8217;t accoMatching Pilot oflish it with the Tydirium then Gold Squadron 1 can acoMatching Pilot oflish it by the same time but you&#8217;ll only get 3 instead of 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As you have read this is all so easy to pull off due to the pulling. Your activation is good and you only give 5 force to the opponent when you can drain for up to 14. I&#8217;ve made the deck as solid as I can to take on as much as it can. This is where I need you to make your reviews and comments. I don&#8217;t want reviews that are short and unhelpful. Try to make your reviews at least 2 full sentences. Onto the Deck VS Deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
III. DECK VS DECK review<br>
<br>
Deck Matchups:<br>
Vs. BHBM<br>
Give him Luke ASAP! That extra force he&#8217;ll be losing each turn will be the death of him. Other than that, just go about your normal business, using your cards to make sure that you dont lose battles, but with a jedi luke, it is very unlikely that they would win enough battles to turn him.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hunt Down<br>
Dont Blind Duel. If you can, get Jedi Luke and his saber out, and set up some decent destiny, the 3 that luke subtracts from their total should finish off vader. When reflections 2 comes out, I&#8217;ll add in two of the new TT/OOC cards. If they dont get ephant mon out first turn, use madine to get a spy there, but be careful, as they will probably beat you down, so use caution, and common sense. Just sit and drain, and maybe drop a beatdown crew on vader, but be careful of barriers and you are beatens, they can ruin your day very fast.<br>
<br>
Vs. MKOS<br>
Drain Race! With all your drains that are uncancelable by their Obj and Den Of Thieves, they&#8217;ll just be plain screwed. Menace Fades will also ruin their day since the mosep/gailid combo doesnt work. Abyssins may be a slight problem, but they wont be able to clear you off your sites, and the drains will overcome their retrieval with scum.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vs. Prodigy<br>
Ha. Although this deck is good, since you can pull whatever card you need (just about) for any situation, you can handle this, as well as many other decks. I haven&#8217;t played this yet, but I would assume the drains would quickly overcome their pitiful retrieval with scum and brangus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vs. Big Blue Drainer<br>
This should be called the Big Gray Out-Drainer. Puh-Lease, this decks drains are special because they are fast, and they can&#8217;t be cancelled or modified. That, and the immunity is insane, all your characters might as well be jedi with that nice immunity to attrition <5.<br>
<br>
Thanks for looking,<br>
