<br>
MBO 0 Side - flip when you control 3 yavin IV sites and DS controls less than 3 Yavin sites.  This should be fairly easy, since you have the EPP mains and 4 deploy 2 scrubs.  Also, you can deploy the squadron ships to the DB and take off for free.  Imperials deploy +2 - and LS can never drain...so why would the DS even bother to keep you from flipping?  To stop the ultimate power of MBO - that everyone think sucks? I am not counting on that.<br>
<br>
Once you flip - power +3 at all systems, proton torpedoes deploy from reserve deck (that is all I am interested in)  YOU CAN NEVER BE FLIPPED BACK...<br>
<br>
Lets go card by card...<br>
4 capitals? may be too many, but with launching the assualt it is awesome.  I would consider changing tantive for spiral or defiance.<br>
<br>
The starfighters? ability two pilots. gold/red deploy cheap to yavin.  and red deploy and use proton torpedoes for free.  The blue ones mean you can actually hit things with your weapons.<br>
<br>
Harc Seff - so good I don&#8217;t need to explain, plus a alien pilot.<br>
<br>
Bantha Droid? no lateral damage, can&#8217;t be battled, sensed, altered, plus starfighters at Yavin will be immune less than 3.  Not bad for 2 deploy 4 destiny.  This card is way to good not to use with the prolification of docking bays now.  You can move it around where you need it too.<br>
<br>
Ackbar - iffy choice here - but pulling the AO is critical.<br>
<br>
bousch/EPP leia - both very good<br>
Mains - well they are always good<br>
4 deploy 2 scrubs/pilots - help to flip and generally good<br>
Salm - when piloting a ywing you can get you a new battle destiny draw.<br>
Cracken/Blount - you know these guys<br>
Tarn Mison - makes all the characters on a ship I shoot at forfeit =0.	Load up some ship to keep going after me...and this would be sweet.  And a destiny 3<br>
<br>
Aim High = power +5 if I fire two weapons. and retrieval damage - I start this.<br>
<br>
Superficial Damage - forfeit the protons and deploy them next turn.  This effectively makes all ship immune less than 3.<br>
<br>
Insight - need it to grab honor, and honor protects your yavin sites from getting drained at.<br>
<br>
launching the assualt isn&#8217;t needed right away so find it later or pull it if you draw honor.<br>
<br>
the two AOs give you power plus +3 for each starship firing a weapon.  That means if I have two ships with two weapons and they both fire...I am power +14.  I shouldn&#146;t lose any battles, in space.<br>
<br>
projection? gotta stop the ground drains...<br>
<br>
only two interupts and they both are rebel barriers.  all the starship weapons will lead my opponent to think I have the great starship weapon interupts, and the may avoid.  barriers are needed for ROps - they plan to deploy to the system and move, but I hope to spoil that idea.<br>
<br>
locations...any of the three good space drains will win the game.  and you should have plenty of activation and enough yavin sites to flip fast.<br>
