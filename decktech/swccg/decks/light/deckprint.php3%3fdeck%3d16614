<br>
I have so many Tunnel Visions in here so I can make sure I get my needed cards out.  First things you want are clouds, then 1 Tibanna Gas Miner with Nar Shadda.  Then get out Squadron Assignments and then Kebyc.  All those are searchable with cards other than Tunnel Vision (except Kebyc), so if you can, use those cards as they are recyclable (for Podracing!).  I have lots of interrupts in here with high destinies so I can quickly win the podrace and play I Did It!  to help out against force-savers and extra retrieval.  I usually don&#146;t use the Battleground site/system part, it&#146;s just too hard to maintain the North Ridge.  I have Sullust in here basically for activation, but it&#146;s extremely useful against ground-based decks.  All of the pilots on their ships can draw battle destiny alone, so you only need 1 on each cloud sector.  The rest can go to systems to hold those places, or the pilots to hold the ground somewhere necessary.  When you get 3 clouds out (controlling each one) and 1 Gas Miner, Kebyc, and a guy at each Echo site, and I&#146;ll Take the Leader, you are hitting them for a loss of 10 each turn, 6 of which are from the reserve deck.  You are draining for 1 at each Echo site, and with I&#146;ll Take the Leader out, 2 at the docking bay (if you hold the system).  And all of these characters and ships are relatively protected from anything, except for a TIE-heavy SFS weapon deck.  Your shielded characters will stay there for the whole game.  Your cloud-ships will stay all the time except against TIE decks.  And this is easily set up, save the clouds, which you&#146;ll get in at most turn 4.<br>
<br>
The podracing portion is usually in favor for you, although I have lost 1 race.  However, it did not defeat me.  It just took longer to defeat them.  The only reason I start with Podracing is that the odds are heavily in my favor, as all the interrupts are recyclable and high destiny averaged (except Tunnel Vision).  Also, it starts exactly as the Signal does, but with more damage and retrieval.  Much better than the Signal I&#146;d say.  Enjoy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
