Ill Take the Leader x2 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Strategy... right... Strategy doesn&#146;t seem to be much of a concern when people review decks, here, does it? If you&#146;re really interested in the match-ups against various (pre-Jabba&#146;s Sealed) Dark Decks, then go check out my &quot;You&#146;ll Never Find My Hidden Base&quot; deck which is the same deck with an absurdly low rating.<br>
<br>
However, a brief synopsis: Check the destiny in this deck again before you go further. They are very high. An average destiny over 3. You&#146;ll pull all your locations by the second turn (decent activation) and start drawing your characters and recycling used interrupts and using Traffic Control. Soon, all your battle destiny will be big. If you can track, they will all be 6&#146;s and 5&#146;s. You will block force drains with undercover spies and Projection. You will cause damage with Legendary Starfighter (if they go to space), Advantage (if they go to the ground) and Order to Engage (if they go somewhere). You will amass forces they don&#146;t want to fight or are foolish to fight.<br>
<br>
Starting: start Insurrection always. Strike Planning and Squassin are the usual. But use Wise Advice against BHBM or any SAC heavy deck. Use Insight to get Honor (pre-Jabba&#146;s Sealed, remember?) against Hunt Down.<br>
<br>
It&#146;s a PILE, right, Clint? Leave your critique alone until other people see the deck. Thanks for the one word review, by the way. I now know that it must be my skill as a player that saw this deck go 16-0 (and to the kid who gave it a cruddy rating, saying &quot;I don&#146;t know if it could go 14-0,&quot; it did--but on its way to 16-0; 14-0 was a brief moment passing), and it was my skill as a player that saw a PILE like this win the MN Grand Slam. And it was a fairly original PILE not built for me by somebody else, too...<br>
<br>
I don&#146;t care about reviews, people, except that I&#146;d like for the players on DeckTech to be able to see a new idea before it gets absolutely panned by worthless (as in not one suggestion or critique was made) reviews.<br>
<br>
End rant. Enjoy deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
