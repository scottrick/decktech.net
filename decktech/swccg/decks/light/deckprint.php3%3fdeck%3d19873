Well it is unique and only covers ONE SITE so it&#146;s NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL, that being said let me continue<br>
<br>
This is a drain and battle game, you need to be smart and pick waht you do carefully, this is not a throw @#$% down and hope it has more power than your opponnet&#146;s type of deck<br>
<br>
EARLY GAME<br>
<br>
FIST TURN BEFORE YOU ACTIVATE---Pull Kuat w/ Mob. Points all of the sudden you are generating 5 force (Kuat +2 generation im Wake on table) instead of 2 plus whatever your opponent gives you thats a nice start and good enough.  Thrown down any other systems you may have and go looking for them and any effects if you can.  The first effect I would pull with Twi&#146;Lek is Colo early in the game, I will explain later.  Hold off on SFS for a bit.<br>
Begin your supremacy of the skies.  Get your bombers in postion and get pilots on planes early on.<br>
<br>
MID GAME<br>
<br>
BOMB any interior sites you can, If they are playing outside or in docking bays the use bombing runs to take care of them, plow the road for the monster machines and Jedi to take care of stragglers. Use Tallon Rolls and APTW to secure control of their home system and fend off any rebel upstarts or republic pansies.  Your SDs are for back up and forfiet fodder more than anything your Saber&#146;s and Scythe&#146;s are your workhorses.  Use your scimitars as forfieters as well- SFS lets TIEs lost from table to go to used pile just keep recycling those 7s.<br>
<br>
moving on.....WAIT YOU SAID YOU WOULD EXPLAIN COLO FISH!<br>
<br>
if I really need to I will, The Colo claw fish allows me to take a destiny 7 out of my hand and keep it in reserve.  If I draw a low destiny I get to use the 7 in reserve.  BUT JAMES, THEN THE LOW DESTINY IS IN YOUR RESERVE!  NO I can still use that low destiny for bombing runs, I draw a 6 during a run attack and miss I switch it for a 2 and take out half the forces, then I could use the 6 for the impending Battle destiny.  I can use all my destinies, i need just as many lows as I do highs, The Colo Claw Fish allows me to have complete control over when I get those destinies.<br>
<br>
LATE GAME<br>
<br>
Retrieve, drain at big systems like Kash and Sullust Battle when they come to you.<br>
<br>
Matchups<br>
<br>
WYS- YOU SHOULD WIN THIS, the space is weak compared to your fleet not to hard.  If they have the D-shield (WHICH THEY SHOULD) they can only pick one site others will suffer your wrath!<br>
<br>
LS COMBAT- Your Jedi should be able to handle this pretty easily, collapse what you can, These are ground intensive decks so you should rule.<br>
<br>
Boom Race- You can&#146;t win the race for get it you don&#146;t need to  worry about it you will survive. Control Endor right off the bat and get walkers to the sites and cut them off from the bunker.  Bombing run thier scouts using a placed destiny from the colo claw fish.<br>
<br>
QMC- Bomb the interior sites, throw walkers on exterior sites and control those keep them indoors and at the bombers mercy.  Space should be an easy win here too<br>
<br>
SENATE- Collapse the senate game over you win.  If you can&#146;t do that then kill them in space game over you win.  IN fact now that I think of it GAME OVER YOU WIN!<br>
<br>
Card Explainations<br>
Accuser?- Good Cheap React trap<br>
WHY NOT START WITH SYCFA?- I don&#146;t want to fill my deck with useless DS stuff when I get the same effect without any of it<br>
COLO CLAW FISH?- DUDE! YOU DIDN&quot;T READ THE STRAT!!!!<br>
CHEAP HUH, WAHTS WITH BLIZZ 4 THEN?- I can afford the 1 force upkeep plus its a beast that lets me pull Vader or Mara from my reserve deck and deply on it for free! and since disembarking is unlimited I can dso that for free!<br>
LATHE?- I HATE ALIENS!<br>
<br>
