As for the recent happenings with Wizards of the Coast, i say, we the players will keep this game alive.<br>
<br>
Now some people will look at this and say CHANDRA FANS!?!? NO STARFLEET!?!?  But please read it through and think about it, &#148;She may not look like much, but she has it where it counts&#148;<br>
<br>
Alright, first turn you want to pull I did It! and start podracing as soon as possible.  Use the two &#148;You will take me to Jabba Now&#148;s to get out Kabe and Tessek.  Get them to the Audience Chamber and use Bo Shuda to defend it, make sure you have jabbas palace fortified so they can’t cancel it.  <br>
<br>
Now you want to set up drains at about three Tat Sites, use the bonuses the Chandra Fans get to control the sites, and make sure that you have two aliens at a site, so you get two destinys, the destinys in this deck are high.  I once had power twenty two, with just a Master Luke, and two Chandra Fans.  Once you win the race, they wont be able to save up because of I did so it rules out any major beatdown, you will be able to repel an attack if you place the characters right.  Also get The Camp down to make their deploy there +1.<br>
<br>
Now while you are draining them use It could be Worse, Bargaining table and the Abilaty of the 2nd side of the objective (cancel a drain by putting a copy of your rep there).  Get ultimatum, the two Projections and a Gift down to furthur reduce their drains.  <br>
<br>
If you look at the character base, you can tell that it is more than enough to hold down the deserted plant known as tatooine, you can retrieve with the Wind Chimes, and you significantly cut down on their drains.  The weakness in this deck?  Nothing in it flies, no starfleet.  But if they are playing heavy star fleet you will be able to drain on Tat without spreading out and remember the podrace which gives you a big bonus quickly (this deck has never lost a podrace).  You can also cancel alot of their drains with the above mentioned methods.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to review it, may the force be with you all!<br>
<br>
Sorry for any mistakes or problems with the format, remember, this is my first deck on here in a while so please excuse spelling and format errors.
