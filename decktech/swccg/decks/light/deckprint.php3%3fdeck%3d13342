 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">update- well it looks like visage will be a problem. is it, sure. are there a few ways to deal with it? sure. i must admit that i dont include a lot of anti hdadtj because in the local meta it is not that popular. but you still have the spies to cancel it. worst case scenario, you stick obi or luke in a t47 and keep both players losing to it. i deleted a 1/2 star review, because simply it did not explain what was wrong with this deck. i may toss out a review that claims s+d will hurt me, mabey not tho.<br>
<br>
start 1 and 4 marker<br>
start HFTMF and 3 effects u want (always strike planning). pull madine asap and setup ebo on hoth. the 1st effect you will signal for is ansb. <br>
fight, direct damage and drain in air and land.<br>
<br>
the destiny cancelers:<br>
wedge + corran or a pilot in a t47<br>
solo + chewbacca<br>
any general or admiral + rebel leadership<br>
that one ao<br>
thanespi in some cases<br>
man thats alot<br>
<br>
insurrection in the 61st card in this deck<br>
u dont need close air support cause alot of the time you wont have scouts in speeders o ground (solo/chewie is the exception)<br>
<br>
use the one ao+ generals at sites= more force loss for dark<br>
<br>
<br>
what to do: use rebel leadership and your combos + effects and shut down the opponent and beat him. this deck can win many different ways.<br>
always put extra leaders at the warroom it is unexpected!!! and is helpful!!<br>
the ao&#8217;s are trackable 6&#8217;s that cant get grabbed!!<br>
<br>
why? : well alot of dark decks rely on many destinys (bhbm, hd, scum, ect) and are really weaker without them. <br>
<br>
&#8221;matchups&#8221;<br>
hd- get a spy to the holotheatre. if u can. otherwise put luke or obi in a speeder to keep his obj on the 0 side. fight him with the speeders. drain him with the ships.<br>
bhbm-its like hd without visage. give him luke and try n win some duels.<br>
scum-hmm... well they cant capture guys in speeders. menace bades is anti galid, strikeforce anti barganing table. be smart, dont get raped<br>
space- use your stuff. play the ao u need. one is anti ties, its really cool. <br>
aoBS- i dunno<br>
