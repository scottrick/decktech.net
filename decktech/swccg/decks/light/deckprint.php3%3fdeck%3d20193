Not that I really give much of a damn, but I would think my religious preference (or my displaying of it) shouldn’t affect how one reviews my Star Wars deck. I’m also white. Dock a star for that, too!<br>
<br>
<u><b>NOTE</u></b>: <i>This deck has not been playtested for a post-Theed meta. This posting is merely an enshrinement of my all-time favorite deck. However, I’ll probably still use this anyway in what tournaments I go to. One addition would be the new Artoo, who works well with the Tatooine text (I use the Coruscant version) and is a trackable destiny immune to the new Objective’s flip-side text. Also a third EPP Luke to combat the droid that doesn’t allow smugglers to apply their ability for battle destiny. Another possible addition would be the Mos Espa DB, which would allow you to spread out a bit against the droid deck and incur higher drains.</i> <br>
<br>
From the 2001 Texas State Championship to FreedomCon and beyond, this deck has served me with incredible consistency for nearly a year. This is the only deck I’ve used in tournament play in 2001 other than Hidden Mains at a pre-Reflections II event, and QMC at several post-Tatooine tournaments. It has been my deck of choice since the Objective’s release, and remains as solid as it ever was. <br>
<br>
<u><b>HISTORY</u></b> <br>
When Reflections II was released, I was skeptical of the WYS Objective. But a player by the name of Eric Berger was not. During a playtest at a friend’s house right around the release, Eric decided to to throw a LS together to playtest with. He decided to use a lot of Palace Raiders and Patrol Crafts. He consulted me to help him build it, and about thirty minutes later, we had created what later became locally known as “The Machine.” It was playtested once against Matt Lush’s Hunt Down, and that was it. We recognized it’s power. The deck was shared with Steven Lewis, and a version of it was used by he and two others at the Normal DPC. All three of those using it placed in the top 10. I used it at States, and it went undefeated in the sanctioned games, but lost in the final confrontation (which my DS deck won for me). The deck lost a lot of popularity around this time, as many opted for non-Raider WYS for the the months ahead. Raiders resurfaced occaisionally, but always took a backseat to a more standard version of WYS. I rebuilt The Machine of old sometime after Tatooine was released, but it was much different. Less Raiders, less Crafts, more space, and defense against Podracing and the new meta. It tallied a 5-1 record for me before I attended my first World Championship -- FreedomCon. There, I made many adjustments to the deck at the advice of others, and it finished 2-2 on Day 2, losing to Steven Lewis’ Watto and Matt Berta’s Hunt Down in a close timed game. It bounced back at another local a few weeks later, moving it’s overall tournament record for me to 19-3. <br>

<br>
<u><b>HOW IT WORKS</u></b> <br>
This is purely a defensive deck. It is not meant to beatdown or attack the opponent, although beatdown is a very possible and somewhat common scenario when using this. Your primary strategy is to achieve ”total lockdown” of your opponent, disabling his gameplan by removing his ability to deliver damage to you. <br>
<br>
In the early game, you want to flip, but you obviously don’t want to walk into an early beatdown, which many dark decks are now capable of. The flip occurs usually around the second or third turn, but you need not be aggressive to flip. I usually drop some characters to the Home One DB early, and set up in space for the first few turns. When I’m ready, I’ll position my Raiders and let the lockdown do its work. <br>
<br>
By the middle stages of the game, the opponent will likely be ready to mount an attack on your Raiders (depending on what deck you’re facing). Fallen Portal is still huge. Barriers work on the ground and in space, which is why I use two of them. I rarely see Blast Door Controls here, but you can make adjustments if your meta requires them (i.e. Alternatives To Fighting, It’s A Trap, etc). You further hinder your opponent’s ability to battle effectively with the reacting Raiders and high rate of attrition. Once the Tank hits, the opponent will be virtually unable to clear you off the ground. Almost any dark deck that attempts to fight you will eventually exhaust itself. <br>
<br>
In the late game, you finish off what cards they have left. Deploy Kessel. Drain. Retrieve. The lockdown will usually resurface here against a deck that battled all game. <br>
<br>
<u><b>CARD EXPLANATIONS AND TECH</u></b> <br>
<i>Bacta Tank</i> — This card is utterly huge in WYS; I’m amazed how it is so often overlooked. Smugglers are cheap, yet they forfiet for large amounts. Patrol Crafts have no immunity to attrition. This card solves that problem. It’s not really meant for the more expensive characters (i.e. EPP Luke, Chewie), but it’s a reliable and effective alternative to using an absurd amount of Raiders. Also, it’s obviously not going to get canceled by Alter, and nobody plays Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down anymore. <br>
<br>
<i>I’ll Take The Leader x2</i> — I use two of this card because it forms a nice combo with Bacta Tank. Since you can relocate lost ships to the docking bays instead of the lost pile, and you can use the Tank to recur the pilots, you have the ability to continually replenish your space fleet. <br>
<br>
<i>Projection Of A Skywalker</i> — I stole this tech from Brian Hunter. Since my strategy isn’t based around controlling the Cantina, and the most common strategy against WYS is to control the Cantina, this card, combined with Menace Fades, can virtually remove that annoying drain all together. It also works nicely against Watto and Combat. <br>
<br>
<i>It’s A Hit! + It Could Be Worse</i> — This combo is the heart of this deck. Combined with Threepio or Mirax, and the fact that the vast majority of all decks now only use one grabber (the Shield), this combo can create a lockdown on the opponent’s drains that cannot be stopped. They can grab one or the other, but not both, allowing you to track them around all game and prevent them from incurring much drain damage against you on your own sites. As I mentioned, the most common strategy players use against WYS is quick control of the Cantina. This effectively hinders that strategy. Both cards also have many other uses, lending a vast amount of versatility to this deck. Even helps shut down Watto decks as well, especially if they mistakenly grab It’s A Hit! over It Could Be Worse, as you have the option of shutting down their direct damage or Force drains. Hold your grabber against a deck/opponent you suspect might be using It’s Worse. <br>
<br>
<i>We Wish To Board At Once</i> — This is the primary tracking method I employ, as you pull the second copy by playing the first one, and vice versa. Their grabber will usually be already used, thus this tracking loop isn’t likely to be stopped. I also play two because of the large amount of effects I use. I like Goo Nee Tay quickly, Bacta Tank consistently, and so forth. <br>
<br>
<i>Spaceport Docking Bay</i> — I use this instead of the Mos Espa DB for several reasons. For one, my starships deploy -1 here, and frieghters deploy -2. I deploy my ships here and shuttle them up to the system for free. This makes the first-turn flip very feasible. Also, the opponent’s pilots deploy +1 here, which so many players either forget about or don’t realize. No Escape is somewhat common, yes, but most of their characters will still deploy for normal cost (Goo Nee Tay + pilot text). <br>
<br>
<i>Fallen Portal</i> — There are quite a few destiny-4 cards in this deck, but not many cards with destiny higher than that. But this card still consistently removes Dark Jedi from battle, thanks to Insight. Also, you need not worry about They’re Still Coming Through! screwing you over, because your characters at the docking bays will usually be safe inside Patrol Crafts. <br>
<br>
<i>Don’t Underestimate Our Chances</i> — This is a recent addition, but nontheless a useful one. Combined with Fallen Portal, this card can easily cost the opponent 10-15 cards they didn’t plan on losing. <br>
<br>
<i>All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin</i> — I use this mostly to circumvent Guri and Imperial Command, but it also pulls ships (necessary because I don’t use Theron + Red 10), and is a trackable five. <br>
<br>
<u><b>MISCELLANEOUS STRATEGY NOTES:</u></b> <br>
-You rarely use any Shields save for Battle Plan and A Tragedy Has Occured, obviously. <br>
<br>
-Some additions that would be nice include: Were You Looking For Me?, Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes, Sorry About The Mess & Blaster Proficiency, A Few Maneuvers, On The Edge, Houjix & Out Of Nowhere, and Theron Nett + Red 10. <br>
<br>
-If you see a lot of Senate, add Strikeforce. Hunt Down? Transmission Terminated. Watto? Lost In The Wilderness. An so forth. <br>
<br>
I’m not going to continue with the strategy because it’s pretty much a moot point anyway, as any new set changes a deck extensively in most cases. I don’t want to write a pre-Theed meta strategy, because I’d be wasting everyone’s time. But thanks for looking. If you want to know anything about the deck, just d-mail me. <br>
