I know I only play with 1 Obi and 1 Luke but that is just because my main focus is not on the ground. I try focsing on space but if I do get caught on the ground the EPP's and the forfeit 7 rebal pilots (w/insurrection) can actually handle themselves pretty well. The ships I picked for specific reasons:<br>
Corvette x6 - it was origonally 10 but as I added more cards and played more I found 6 was about right. they are very nice with Mantellian Savrip and the deploy 4, power 5, forfeit 8 can be great in space.<br>
both falcons - well this is a no-brainer in a space deck. I use both because sometimes Han can get tied up on the ground and won't be able to pilot his ship so Lando takes over. also if I have a need for ships in space but I don't have any pilots in hand I can still deploy LiMF.<br>
Redemption - combined with Bacta tank and the heavy forfeit pilots this can be a life saver<br>
Spiral - react for 2 from hand? very nice...<br>
Tantive - so you're deploying D*? alright force drain of 3... :)<br>
<br>
the effects I have all have their specific reasons. most are self explainitory but here are some that might not be:<br>
Draw Their Fire - is not completely necessary but is a nice combo with Frozen Assets and you can retreive force for initiating battles<br>
Frozen Assets - good when combined with draw their fire, also makes them wait if they are saving up for things<br>
Haven - I normally play this on Y4 but can go on R Point for ships and pilots to deploy for next to nothing<br>
Revo x3 - This was life saver for me against Hunt Down. I revoed both Executor sites and he was generating a total of 2 force. this forced him to deploy Death Star so he could generate something and it gave me an extra 3 force drain.<br>
Wise Advice - this deck kinda lacks on SAC protection. I chose this over DODN because it also lets me play my grabbers for free.<br>
<br>
The Interrupts are just general interrupts: Clash, Grimtaash, Trans Term, and the Noble Sac's allow me to retreive a bunch by sacrificing the pilots.<br>
<br>
generally when I play I start Rendzvous Point and Insurrection. I just try to get my systems out and start force draining at the systems. if DS is heavy ground I try to stay in space and if they are playing space I try to find a weak location and battle them hard there. sacrificing the rebal pilots for 7 is incredably useful when they are having to sacrifice an SD for attrition.<br>
<br>
against Hunt Down - basicly just cancel Visage and then just drain in space. I beat a hunt down by a good amount once using this tactic. revolutioning his high generating sites can hurt him.<br>
<br>
against ROPS - this is a hard one. draining in space doesn't help much because of the -1 when flipped. if you can get to the Ralltiir system b4 it gets flipped hold it with as much as you can spare to keep it from flipping. this is one of this decks toughest games but if played right you can beat it.<br>
<br>
Court - just lose the one force for not being on Tatooine. drain in space and ignore him. if he comes at you with bounty hunters in their ships hit him hard.<br>
<br>
anything else - basicly just the same. drain in space and if you fight all you have to lose is a rebal pilot or 2. well if you have any comments you can post it in your review or email me at: general_veers98@hotmail.com<br>
