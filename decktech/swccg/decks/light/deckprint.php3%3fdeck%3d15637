Please read:<br>
<br>
This deck plays pretty much like a normal TIGIH scout swarm deck, with the exception of a few things.<br>
<br>
Speeder Bikes - awesome on Endor.  Can react to any battle on Endor other than battles at Chirpa&#8217;s Hut, where there usually isn&#8217;t any battles.  Excellent way to win battles.  If opponent is playing sense, don&#8217;t worry, he can only cancel 1 react.  Most decks don&#8217;t play SAC anymore though.  Plus, Cracken and Blount can pilot them.  A cool annoyance strategy is to put one with LSJK, and when he battles elsewhere with an imperial, react to him and make him lose 2 force until he deploys Vader!  He also can&#8217;t deploy Vader that turn, so he has to eat the 2 force that turn.  Cheezy and effective.<br>
<br>
Get Alongside That One - adds a battle destiny with a speeder bike, even after you react with it.<br>
<br>
Wicket - is Guri/IG-88/4-LOM giving you trouble?  Deploy this little guy and exclude them from battle (targets ability)<br>
<br>
Electrobinoculars - I suck at tracking, so this helps a lot.<br>
<br>
Landing Claws w/ ships - obviously, stop drains from Bossk In Hound&#8217;s, Chimaera, etc.  I prefer A-Wing and Y-Wing to the Leaders in Ships because of 2 reasons:  higher destiny, and lower deploy.<br>
<br>
Yoxgit - if opponent wants to cancel your landing claw, just get it right back again.  or merc armor, portable scanner, electro, disruptor pistol...<br>
<br>
Disruptor Pistol - get rid of a character so he can&#8217;t draw destiny!  or use a cool ability.  It&#8217;s really fun when you have it on Midge or Janse, and you use Electro to set up a 6, then shoot Vader and make him immediately lost!<br>
<br>
Cal Alder - Your vehicles move free when moving to this guy.  Free reacts with your speeder bikes!  Also, he&#8217;s a scout that can be pulled with Crix.<br>
<br>
Wedge and Corran together = they die!<br>
<br>
Some cards I want to add are:<br>
<br>
Luke, Rebel Scout - for BHBM, of course.  Or Endor Ops, where they have lots of vehicles.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Greeve - too bad I don&#8217;t have him.  He&#8217;s a scout that adds to weapon destiny, and is power 3.<br>
<br>
Don&#8217;t Underestimate Our Chances - they battle you, you play this, you react with bikes, you have say... 8 more power than them, that equals 8 battle damage times 3, so that&#8217;s 24 battle damage.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  This is going to be my permanent deck now, instead of changing it every day.  :)<br>
<br>
With these gimics, you will win a lot of battle.  Exclude them, make them lost, add destinies, reacts... rock on.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
