<b>Strategy Section Edit!</b><br>
<B>#1</b> I apologize for my mis-information.  I never bothered rereading many parts of the spoiler, and as such I was unaware the Epic Event Deep Hatred doesn&#8217;t grant the light side the ability to use combat cards.  Thanks Ken Bradford, for that info- I have changed the appropriate sections accordingly.  I also had a brain fart and said WYS won DragonCon, when it was actually a broken Senate in the hands of Andy McClure.  Lastly, <b>remember this deck is meant to be played in the R3 environment!</b>  If you want to use something similar this weekend or whatever, be sure to account for the fact that there are no R3 cards out there (like you might want to throw back in Beggar, or a counter for the ROC/MAIH combo)!<br>
<br>
<b>#2</b> Apparently Steve Baroni wasn&#8217;t satisfied with my explanation as to why A Useless Gesture is a nonfactor.  &#8221;Hayes the new defensive sheild hoses the deck. I dont know what you are talking about this thing just wont be able to win after ref 3. The deck is awesome in the currrent einviorment but the shield absolutely hoses the deck,&#8221; says his 3 star review.  Unfortunately, he doesn&#8217;t actually explain <b><i>how</b></i> it hoses the deck.  If someone could please explain to me <b>why</b> the shield hoses the deck I would gladly listen (and either accept your explanation, or prove you wrong).<br>
<br>
<b>#3</b> Read this article!  http://www.decktech.net/swccg/articles/articledetail.php3?article=2933  Mad props to <b>Devon &#8221;Devonator&#8221; Clark</b> for his wonderfully written explanation describing A Useless Gesture&#8217;s impact (or lack thereof) on WYS.<br>
<b>End Edit Update</b><br>
<br>
First and foremost, props go to the original co-creators of the deck type: Jon Chu, TJ Holman, and Clint Hays.  They used the original incarnation of the deck way back when at RamapoCon III.  Since then, the deck has done nothing but dominate major tournaments all over the country.  Allow me establish this deck&#8217;s credentials in the current (pre R3) environment.  Off the top of my head...<br>
<br>
In Open Qualifiers versions of the deck have placed:<br>
First at Origins (Clint)<br>
Second at Origins (TJ)<br>
First at Continentals (Chu)<br>
Second at DragonCon (Praskac)<br>
<br>
At DPCs the deck has placed:<br>
Second at Ramapo (TJ)<br>
Third at Ramapo (Chu)<br>
First in Atlanta (Clint)<br>
Second in Montreal (Chu)<br>
Fourth in Montreal (Gogolen)<br>
First in Denver (Me)<br>
Second in Phoenix (Me)<br>
<br>
And I&#8217;ve used a version of this deck in my last 6 tournaments going 19-0 in sanctioned games, and 3-0 in semi-final and final confrontations with it.  To Jim Li: in those 22 games the deck defeated Brian Hunter&#8217;s Senate twice, Clint Hay&#8217;s Senate twice, and Kyle Craft&#8217;s Senate once.  Please feel free to read my last several tournament reports for descriptions of all 22 games.<br>
<br>
Due to all the exposure the general deck type has received (in tournament reports, etc.) I should hope you have a feeling for how it works.  Basically, it wins through controlling the opponent&#8217;s force activation.  Excluding Kessel, which should never come out until late game, given your locations alone, you have 8 icons (including the activation bonus from controlling the system) and you only give your opponent 3.  Granted your opponent will also be generating more than he gives you, and considering you have DDTA and the backside of the objective, it is impossible for him to overcome that 5-point deficit.  One could object to the fact that you only get 8 force, 9 including yourself.  And I ask you what dark deck gives no force icons to the light side (without Mob Points and twixes, obviously)?  There is none.  There is no dark deck that can activate sufficient force without giving the light side at least 2-3 icons.  It is impossible to out-activate this deck.  That established, at worst, you would be activating the same amount (about 11 or 12).  At best, they will be activating about 13 or 14, but will be giving you far too many icons.  So what does this mean, exactly?  WYS is a cheap and fast deck:<br>
<br>
You have Goo Nee Tay, and they don&#8217;t.<br>
And your ships and characters deploy cheaply, and theirs don&#8217;t.<br>
And you can satisfy Battle Plan and Menace Fades from turn one, and they can&#8217;t.<br>
And they can&#8217;t play Sense/Alter.  <br>
And you can play all of your interrupts twice, and they can&#8217;t.<br>
And you get to add battle destiny everywhere, and they can&#8217;t.<br>
And almost all of your characters are forfeit +2, and theirs aren&#8217;t.<br>
<br>
Give it 11 force and it&#8217;ll be able to go faster than you.  Give it more force and it&#8217;ll only go faster.  It&#8217;s a lose-lose situation for dark, as the deck&#8217;s record clearly demonstrates.<br>
<br>
<b><br>
<font size=&#8221;24&#8221;><br>
So what about the problems with this specific deck in the R3 environment? <br>
</b><br>
</font><br>
<br>
Grabbers- Oh no, you can&#8217;t play your interrupts twice.  So what?  As if there aren&#8217;t enough benefits from the objective.<br>
<br>
<B>A Useless Gesture (the new DShield)</b>- This shield is so appropriately named.  Essentially this does the same thing as grabbers, only less effectively.  Instead of being able to stop me from abusing the first couple, key interrupts I need to play to get going, I can no longer abuse my late game interrupts.  From the moment I caught wind of this card&#8217;s text I started paying close attention to my mid to late game use of interrupts.  I watched how many I played, which ones I played, and how essential each one was.  As it turns out I was able to change my play style and started using less and less.  The only thing the shield really affects is On The Edge, but already people we playing Do They Have A Code Clearance, so it&#8217;s like the shield has been out all along.<br>
<br>
Other DShields- are a non issue altogether.  None of the shields are anything new; WYS has always had to deal with the cards that were made into shields, and it&#8217;s always won against them.  Now they are just in the opponent&#8217;s side board so as to allow more battle interrupts and stuff.<br>
<br>
The New Mains / Ghhhk & TRWEU- WYS was a deck that liked to spread thin in the beginning: a ship to the system, and a guy to the Cantina for the flip, and a Dodge and/or Barrier to protect him.  My version went from having 2x Barrier and 1x Dodge to having 2x Dodge thanks to all the Barrier hate out there.  Now everyone plays TRWEU to cancel the react, so <B>play style must be adapted</b>.  The first turn flip that I mentioned above is risky now, especially with the hard-hitting power that comes with the new characters for dark.  So what do you do?  You wait a turn and fortify more.  Instead of Dodge acting as the crux of your defense, you now have a Houjix and 2 Run Luke Runs.  Instead of always flipping first turn, you wait one more and get 2 smugglers at the Cantina and a ship to the system.  It&#8217;s that simple.<br>
<br>
The New Objective- WYS never relied on Luke being on the for much more than countering Maul or for combating Visage.  Well, if they want to use the new objective well they won&#8217;t be using Tat Maul and Visage won&#8217;t be an issue.  So that means Luke isn&#8217;t under any pressure.  Just use the 4 (!!!!!!!!!) icons they give you to set up even faster and more securely.  There is no reason to confront Maul.  Remember, the dark objective only prevents Luke from initiating drains- you can still use him to wreck with, just forfeit him after, or move him to the Home One: DB.  Just establish menace fades, and you can&#8217;t lose.  <br>
<br>
HDADTJ Dueling- People will be using the Deep Hatred Epic Event to duel again.  There are several ways you can combat this strategy.  For one, you can simply cancel the Obsession with Run Luke Run (of which there are two in the deck).  Or you can let them duel you, and waste their combat cards, then play A Jedi&#8217;s Resilience.  Depending on how things work out, you could very well implement either of these strategies from the lost pile, despite the shield (you won&#8217;t ALWAYS have 3 or more smugglers on the table), and no dark decks play more than like 3 Obsessions (and they&#8217;ll prolly lose one at some point).<br>
<br>
Senate- They have a lot of problems with the force management.  Obviously Tatooine Maul can be a problem for the deck, but with Goo Nee Tay out you can be sure he will come out to the Desert Landing Site, as opposed to in space.  On top of that he likes to go Lost in the Wilderness (of which there is only one in the deck now, because everyone expects it).  Also, Lott Dod becomes a double edged sword- by taking a card from your force pile you are further minimizing your activation.<br>
<br>
Maul- There are 6 characters with ability > 3.  If you lose one, you can A Step Backwards for it.  That works especially well with Luke and On The Edge.<br>
<br>
MKOS- It&#8217;s back.  Fortunately there is a lot of anti MKOS out there, so it&#8217;s a gamble to play it.  Basically, to approach this game you will want to get the 3 key effects out: Goo Nee Tay, Battle Plan, and MENACE FADES.  These will force them to come to you and fight you on your terms.  This means they will spread their forces and you can knock them off battlegrounds.  Their ability to cancel destinies doesn&#8217;t do much good when you draw multiple.  Your Aim High will stop their retrieval for a good portion of the game, making your Edges more effective.  The Kessel drain is key to winning this match up.  Being able to fight them off and keep that drain going is what will win the game.<br>
<br>
ROC/MAIH combo- SATM, On The Edge, and As Good As Gone are all acceptable counters to this problem.  There is no AGAG in this version of the deck because no one will be playing the combo because of the light side defensive shield.<br>
<br>
Trample- you have your grabber.<br>
<br>
Barrier- you have your counters.  <br>
<br>
Vader draining in the Cantina- You can drop almost ANY two ability 2 mopes and get 2 battle destiny.  With that HFTMF sitting at the bottom of your lost pile I don&#8217;t see how Vader is going to stick around, and given your forfeit, I don&#8217;t see how you&#8217;re going to take battle damage.<br>
<br>
Visage- You have Control & Tunnel Visions and 3 Jedi Luke&#8217;s.  You will get him out so you will both be losing to Visage.  Now, you have retrieval and they have none, so what&#8217;s the problem?  If you lose Luke, or if they kill him or something, you can always A Step Backwards for him (and if you&#8217;re losing mostly interrupts from hand, it&#8217;s like not losing any cards at all!).<br>
<br>
In fact, the only &#8221;actual&#8221; weakness this deck might have is with space.  It&#8217;s not that WYS space is weak- on the contrary it&#8217;s probably the most effective way to play space available to light- it&#8217;s just that this specific version (and most versions) of the deck is metaed to handle the ground game, against mains and toys and the likes.  As I see it, there are 2 schools of space: TIEs or Big Blue, but the thing is, neither is very popular (with the new Boba and other characters, you can be sure this trend will continue) and both have obvious flaws WYS can take advantage of.  You can very easily throw in A Few Maneuvers, maybe another cannon, Legendary Starfighter, Frozen Assets or Beggar, the AWRI combo, etc. and have a WYS deck capable of defeating ANY dark space deck: it&#8217;s all about how you play it.  Against TIEs you&#8217;ll want to drain them on the ground, and use your AO to your advantage.  Don&#8217;t jump to space like you normally would, as it would give them a chance to beat you down.  Instead let them make the first move then attack them, then enforce Battle Plan.  Attempt to lure them into grabbing something less essential and use your 2 On The Edges to retrieve at least 20 force.  Big Blue is less of a danger than TIEs in that it&#8217;s dramatically slower.  You can afford to jump to space, and can even fortify a system so that they won&#8217;t mess with you for a while.  Instead of sitting on Tatooine you&#8217;ll prolly want to get on one of their systems to start draining for 2.  You might want to initiate a few mock battles just so you can grab Imp Command.  By the time they realize they have to come attack you, you should have destinies tracked and should be able to take them out.<br>
<br>
<b>Card Selection Notes: </b><br>
<br>
Old Tatooine is better.  Who doesn&#8217;t use ZiMH or BiHT, etc?  The movement benefit pales in comparison to the power bonus.  You need all the power you can get on the ground.<br>
<br>
Characters are of a fairly standard mix with 13 smugglers, 3 Jedi, 2 track masters, and 6 characters with ability > 3.<br>
<br>
I opted for one less Control & TV because it&#8217;s jut not as useful as it used to be, and I find myself not requiring it as much as I used to.<br>
<br>
Everything else is standard, with the exception of my patented 2x Goo Nee Tay.<br>
<br>
As always, if there is anything you have questions about please let me know through your review, email, dmail, or on AIM, and I will try to get back to you personally or add something to the strategy section.<br>
