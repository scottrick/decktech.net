And DoS is usually another leia with gun, I put DoS on the list to see what kind of response i would get.  Personally I think she would be worth it if you could deploy her with I Know.<br>
<br>
Strategy edit:  Okay, apparently one person who reviewed this already thinks the deck is only worth half a star because it will get raped by anything with vader or mara or a lightsaber in it.  If your afraid of a second turn mara laying waste to one of your activation weenies, wait till you got a barrier before you deploy one.  If vader and mara have their sticks, WEAPON LEV them.  If vader and mara start a battle at a db, FALLEN PORTAL one of them.  Yes, two of each is adequate for me, if you want more, take out some of the a$$ recyclables.  A$$ for destiny is a joke cuz even though there are a lot of characters, there are also 15 used interrupts of destiny 4-6, and mirax will help you get that other destiny 6 luke back in, but i wont count that.  The only thing that made sense on the review was that activation can be tight if you dont control a docking bay, but in 90% of the games i&#146;ve played, the squid squad holds the home one db, and everyone else is at the spaceport db.  Activation is almost never a problem.<br>
<br>
If you havent played throne room before, here&#8217;s the basic jist of it.  (or at least my rendition of it)  Usual start:  heading for the boat to get insurrection, staging areas, and do or do not/wise advice Turn 1:  Laugh at your opponent for trying to go first, for example, hahaha.  Then deploy one of your characters in your opening hand to a docking bay of your choice, usually the Home One db.  Turn 2:  Put the spaceport docking bay adjacent to one of your opponents locations and deploy a main character, preferably one with a weapon or immunity to attrition.  Turn 3:  From this turn on you should battle with your mains and supporting characters almost every turn.  Use your interrupts wisely and try to track your draws.  And one more thing, use insurrection and TUNNEL VISION to get the cards you need, THIS IS CRITICAL TO MEGA SUCCESS!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for more specific strategies...<br>
<br>
vs Hunt Down<br>
<br>
They probably won&#8217;t duel Luke JK, especially if he has a stick.  Obi is fair game, so try to get that glancing blow into your hand.  2x trans terminated and 3x spies should take care of the visage.  And most HDADTJ lately use the docking bay tech like everything else, so save those fallen portals.  Rebel Barrier and Weapon Lev will be huge cards in this game.  And TUNNEL VISION IS IMPORTANT!!!<br>
<br>
vs BHBM<br>
<br>
The docking bay strategy remains the same as above.  Give them a luke of your choice as soon as vader hits the table.  Look for beatdowns against a lone emperor with the use of your spies and mains.  there&#8217;s not too much bhbm going around since r2 luke, but dont take this as an auto win, bhbm is made to win battles and can give you a run for your money.  DONT FORGET TO USE TUNNEL VISION!!!<br>
<br>
vs SYCFA<br>
<br>
TIES:  if youre expection ties, you may want to sub in an Aim High.  Otherwise, get the spaceport db to one of their systems and park luke and leia there with sticks to drain.  Get a fully loaded Home One (complete with the squid squad!) and pick your battles.  I didn&#8217;t have a grabber in this decklist, but if I&#8217;m expecting ties i&#8217;ll put 1 or 2 in to grab all power and short range fighters.  These are usually close games, cuz you dont have much space, BUT IF YOU USE TUNNEL VISION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE!!!!  You should do just fine.<br>
<br>
SCUM:  Hmmm, lets see, DONT BATTLE THEM AT DEATH STAR SITES!!!  that will lose you da game!  get the super home one to the death star system after you see some ships hit their lost pile.  get your mains to the tat spaceport db, and jabbas palace.  dont go to the audience chamber unless youre sure u can cancel scum.  weapon lev snoovas axe and fallen portal at every opportunity.  DONT FORGET TO PLAY TUNNEL VISION!!!<br>
<br>
vs Court Scum<br>
<br>
Same as scum from above, dont go to the chamber unless you think you can cancel the scum.  this may require the use of some grabbers again.  usually none shall pass and proj telepathy or imp barrier are the money cards.  weapon levs, barriers, and fallen portals are key to winning against scum.  AS IS TUNNEL VISION!!!<br>
<br>
vs ROPS<br>
<br>
if your afraid of rops, then add Ounee Ta and you win.<br>
<br>
vs MKOS<br>
<br>
i saved this one for last for a specific reason, that i hope most people will skip the last strategy and go straight on to awarding this deck all 5 stars.  but for those of you who happened to read this last strategy you will now learn the only thing you can do agains mkos with trm.  put your head between your legs and kiss your a$$ goodbye.  I wont lie to you, this trm has a very hard time of defeating mkos.  i dont know what it is, but mkos is the only thing i have a losing record to.  <br>
anywho...<br>
start as usual, get activation at db&#8217;s, and tunnel vision or draw for mains and aliens.  lando and tawass can be huge in this game.  usually the only time i beat mkos is with a huge beatdown before they flip.  SO TUNNEL VISIONS ARE KEY TO SUCCESS.  cuz the tunnel vision&#8217;s let you pull what you need without drawing up your whole force pile.  this deck used to do pretty good against mkos until sense and alter got screwed.  if you can play  sense and alter and retrieve all the force your gonna lose, then you can beat this deck.  if they keep battling you with scum, your gonna lose.  you have to try and keep a strong enough force of characters together that will make them think twice about battling you.  mkos is not the same as a regular scum deck, ITS MUCH STRONGER, cuz they don&#8217;t draw lousy destinys.  so make sure you got plenty of forfeit fodder with your beatdown squad.<br>
