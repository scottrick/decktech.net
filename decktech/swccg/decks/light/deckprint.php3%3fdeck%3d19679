<br>
start by getting locations from reserve deck, there`s 5 mindful of the futures in the deck.<br>
you can get yoda from reserve deck. sio bibble makes your republic charcters at naboo power +1.<br>
stay here where it`s safe makes yarua and sio bibble more power.<br>
<br>
for podracing the destinies are quite good and step backwards makes it a bit easier. depa billlaba can make you look at the opponent`s destiny. we wish to board at once gets radiant V11 or step backward. defensive shield help if you ever lose a podrace and you can grab an interrupt.<br>
<br>
-vs- new dueling objective<br>
setup and drain in space as fast as possible, and try and get your 2 naboo sites cause it makes there game text worse and yours better. drain in space and try and outpower them. try and sense some of their interrupts. energy walls can be very effective at the right time.jar jar can get rid of those annoying characters cause you put him to the munchen afterwards<br>
<br>
<br>
-vs- senate<br>
setup up in space, be careful, don`t leave a lonely starfighter cause they probably play space.<br>
start to drain on the ground and hopefully win the podrace. you get to retrieve. the drains in space and the ground power will be too much for the opponent.the radiant V11 will be better backup.<br>
<br>
<br>
-vs- watto objective<br>
mostely the same, setup in space and drain really quickly. you can choose go and fight them and drain at naboo. setup up jedi and transport them using yoda`s game text. the drains in space and the power should be too much. jar jar can get rid of watto.<br>
<br>
5 mindful of the futures is not extreme, you reallly need them locations. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
