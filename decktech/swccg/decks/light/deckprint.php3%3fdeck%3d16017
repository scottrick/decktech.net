This deck was made to be a triple threat. Its purpose is to retrieve, force drain, and battle. It has plenty of ground power to fight and retrieve with harvest, power to control Tatooine for celebration, and the sites to drain with. It has a very good record with  8 wins for every 1 loss (average ratio.) <br>
<br>
Card Choices:<br>
Locations - I only use the Moisture farm, the docking bay, the farm and the Cantina because that*s all you really need. Most likely the opponent will deploy more ground locations. You already have great force activation and if he doesn&#8217;t have ground power then spread and drain. <br>
<br>
Characters - All the mains, of course. Coran, just in case you need to cancel Visage and the Spec Ed Pilots Nett and Naytaan because of their awesome game text. While piloting their ships they add a destiny to their power. Wedge can also cancel one of the opponents battle destiny while in battle with one of them. This can also be used on ground if you really need it. R2&3P0 are there to cancel Bad Feeling and take out I have a bad feeling about this.  Owen and Beru combo for Harvest. Picking any up four cards is the ultimate bad arse. <br>
<br>
Starships -  The ships are all powerful, the Liberty is there because it has nice forfeit and can be forfeited to your used pile...not bad. <br>
<br>
Interrupts - Great kick ace example: (The WYS move but a little different) Lets say the Emperor, Mara Jade, and a walker are at the Moisture Farm. He has a power of 16 and destiny...Mara might even have her Saber. Deploy Han to their location and Leia, make sure Luke is at the adjacent site. Initiate battle with I have a bad feeling about this, remember to retrieve 1 force....then bust out  Run Luke Run. Play Clash of Sabers on Mara (because she has a saber)....then you play one of your destiny adders, either Skywalkers or Dont get C0cky. He now has a power of ten and destiny...you now have 12 and at least 5 battle destiny....oh yeah by the way...destiny in this deck is awesome.....slice and dice or blast the Emperor...play any other interrupts if you can.....in the end you slaughter him, kill the emperor the walker, lose maybe one character and beat him by at least 30. If you can*t bust out this combo....don*t worry...regular battles and other destiny adders do the trick. <br>
<br>
Effects: Pretty self explanatory. <br>
<br>
Weapons - Shoot down their srarships...theyre high destiny and power pivot kills. Anakins saber works for Daughter and Luke.<br>
<br>
In a perfect game you set up your drains and you retrieve.....but then your opponent decides to mess up your game. Then you react and frell his arse up.  Remember if you lose your characters or crucial cards...there&#8217;s Tatooine Celebration, Harvest, and Draw their fire to retrieve....another triple threat. <br>
<br>
Matchups: frequently used decks.......<br>
<br>
BHBM - Remember you can deploy Luke from reserve deck or lost pile...use this...get him out....attack his characters...if Luke gets captured dont worry...either kill Vader, or let him get dueled. You have great destinies and he*ll have the Emperor and Vader jerking each other off in the throne room.. 2 less characters to worry about.  Just beat the opponent down and retrieve... Nothing big.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down: Cancel Visage when you can....don*t worry you can retrieve what you lose. Deploy Obi and Luke only for beat downs (kamikaze Jedi), then forfeit them....Rinse and Repeat. Easy way to avoid epic duel.....Remember you also have Run Luke Run. Kill vader with your non-jedi....retrieving will help here. <br>
<br>
Space Decks - Alright...this is where your ground force drains and retrieving will be used without contest. Control Tatooine.. Go for a space beat down if you can. He shouldn&#8217;t be able to overpower you...use your weapons to get rid of his ships. He wont be able to force drain you in space that much anyway.<br>
<br>
Agents of the Black Sun - Not that hard...either I have good luck or I*m good...none of these decks have given me a problem before. All right, he wont have that many characters first of all so if you get rid of his characters you shouldn*t have a problem. Xizor and the Emperor are your targets here. Kill them and beat the shiznit out of them. If they*re gone his objective is useless. No real big ground power here. Retrieve and fight. He*ll play your average weak bounty hunter ships.....remember, they have no immunity to attrition so cancel their destiny with Wedge...power pivot and beat down... get rid of his ships and no more space. <br>
<br>
My favorite Decoration: Free Han...beat down.....retrieve blah blah bvlajd vlaj <br>
<br>
Remember...If you loose some important cards or characters you*ll get them back with at least one of your three ways of retrieving.  Stick to the plan and watch for your opportunities to get the beat down going......this will be your key to winning. Retrieving kinda helps a little too. <br>
<br>
Dont be afraid of  dark decks...Light side always wins....When  the new Tatooine cards come out just make the substitutions. <br>
