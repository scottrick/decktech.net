First turn: Begin racing at the arena.  With such a high destiny deck and Anakin&#146;s Podracer getting two destiny you will probably get a total of an 8 or higher.  With Generic podracers getting only one destiny you can see how I have the advantage.  The only card (unless I am forgetting one) in my deck that I can&#146;t deploy with my starting seven force is<br>

First turn: Begin racing at the arena.  With such a high destiny deck and Anakin&#8217;s Podracer getting two destiny you will probably get a total of an 8 or higher.  With Generic podracers getting only one destiny you can see how I have the advantage.  The only card (unless I am forgetting one) in my deck that I can&#8217;t deploy with my starting seven force is my quiggys.  Hopefully the opponent will give me one or two force (or i will pull either insurrection or one of my sites). If neither of these happens then i will deploy my other characters.  <br>
<br>
My layout is that i would have qui gon at the core, obi wan at the generator, luke (or leia whichever comes first) to the arena.  The one of those that i dont deploy to the arena will go to yoda&#8217;s hut when i get it.  Next deploy chewie (unless i feel that han chewie and the falcon is needed in space) and lando to enemy sites.  Yoda will then go to however is in need of help at sites.  Drain with qui gon, obi wan, luke or leia(whichever went to the arena).  Combat whoever comes to stop you and then continue to drain.  Use I Did It when you win the race but make sure that you occuphy three battle grounds or have han chewie and falcon in space while some other guy on land.  This will prevent you from being hurt by that pesky defensive sheild.  Use Sal Tor Kal Fas to get weapons to your characters and use Thrown Back to cycle through your cards.  Use weapon levitation to get the high destiny weapons and deploy them as combat cards.<br>
