Here's the URL for the original deck: http://www.decktech.net/archive/passive/lightdetail.php3?deck=1228<br>
 The few differences. Jedi Test 1 is used over The Planet That it's Farthest From because of the ECC DS objective. Luke Skywalker is used over Son of Skywalker or Luke with Lightsaber because of the lower deploy cost and the ability to let me activate another force. Also, At Peace was put in because I can pull it from reserve, and it helps to combat Broken Concentration. Arconas are too easily countered these days, so they were pulled for more useful cards. Tibrin is very strong for this deck, because there are a lot of cards that are necessary to the deck, such as Order to Engage, Rebel Fleet, SFoils, and All Wings Report In. Tunnel Vision is just a tremendous card. It lets you get whatever you'd need from your force pile, whether it is a system for draining or a much-needed effect. XWing Laser Cannons, as everyone knows, blows stuff up. Bounty Hunter ships and TIEs die to them.	Also, in the system selection, there is a 2-7 spread in parsec numbers, meaning that only TIE Scouts and the Mist Hunter(with or without Zuckuss) can make the jump.<br>
<br>
<br>
A quick note to those who think TK422 should be in here. Bubo munches on TK422. Also, it isn't very good against a Scum and Villainy deck, since you can't deploy him unless the opponent has an Imperial at that site.<br>
<br>
All constructive reviews are welcomed. Thanks for reading.<br>
