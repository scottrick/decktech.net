i Do have obi&#146;s saber, don&#146;t know how you missed that...umm, noone else had anything interesting to say. ISB is not a problem, the direct damage will kill them and I am thinking of eliminating my Space Package all together for another sense(thank you) wish some more would check this out, it is really a good deck.<br>
<br>
alright fella’s, heres my happy fun Profit Deck that seems to win unreasonably well. I don’t claim to have invented it, but I didn’t copy it from Decktech. Anyways, it plays like a profit deck(duh) and generally flips first turn. I activate 5 on my lonesome, and there are really only a couple of DS Decks that don’t give me any. Generally they play Mara and someone like Dr. E and Ponda or something like that to start. I have many ways to eliminate their aliens on the first turn, anyways, theres not a lot of strategy behind this deck, you free han and then just set up at at least 2 different battlegrounds. I am thinking of switching the Falcon for Artoo in Red 5, but it doesn’t matter that much. I guess some matchups?<br>
<br>
Hunt Down- I hate Hunt Down. Visage irritates the piss out of me, so there are many ways to deal with it. You have corran, Lando and Jar Jar to invade the Executor, OOC/TT to just cancel Visage and Honor(it may work, depends on whether ofr not they play well :) The trend for Hunt Down seems to be Vader/Palpy/Maul/Mara and not many others. This deck slaughters all of those people, and Qui-Gon still won’t die against Duels. HAHAHA. Easy victory.<br>
<br>
Walkers- go to hoth. thats all it takes. Camp Obi and Han on Tatooine and send off the others to storm the Walkers.<br>
<br>
Watto- camp in the junkyard, camp in mos espa and have barriers and SAC ready, cause they’ll try to slap you around. I love this objective, and it’s solid, but if you play smart, you’ll win.<br>
<br>
Big Blue(space)- flip early and grab Imperial Command. Hopefully your drains and Direct Damage will be too much.<br>
<br>
Court/Scum/MKOS- this deck rapes anything with aliens. This is something that happened in a game against a Court deck. For start they deployed Xizor and Boba Fett w/ Blaster. First turn they deployed Snoova and an Axe. I wait and then battle on second turn. Drop Luke for free, Luke’s stick, Lando with Axe, Chewie w/ Blaster and Threepio WHPS. Battle, bounce Snoova, he shoots Chewie, exclude Xizor, swing at and hit Boba, draw 3 destiny. Win by 20. Yeah. Cool.<br>
<br>
I guess thats it for now, any questions e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com<br>
