This is probably the last in a long line of training decks.  After this I&#146;m turning my attention to Light Combat.<br>
<br>
First of all here isa quick run down of how to train efficiently if you dont already know.<br>
<br>
Turn 1<br>
Pull all your stuff (DOS, Yoda, Pack pack, Training area and Yodas Hope and test 1)<br>
<br>
Turn 2<br>
Attempt test 1, complete it.  Pull test two. Put down the jungle to the right of the training area and put test two there.  Move DOS n Yoda there.<br>
<br>
Turn 3<br>
Complete test 2.  Drop the Swamp.  Pull and drop test three (which is automatically done (thanks to The way of things).  Move the training two to the swamp.<br>
<br>
Turn 4<br>
Pull test 4 and deploy it.  Drop yodas hut.  BY now you should be tracking a 7.<br>
<br>
Turn 5<br>
Attempt test 4, pull test 5 and deploy it.<br>
<br>
Turn 6 <br>
Attempt test 5. Pull test 6.<br>
<br>
Turn 7 <br>
Activate to the seven, end of your turn its completed n you get the seven drawn n now ur nice and happy.<br>
<br>
Turn 8<br>
Drop test 6 for either some direct damage, or another destiny in every battle, they cant beat you in this duel since you draw a 7 for sure.<br>
<br>
Alright thats the lowdown on training.  OF course you cant only do that for the whole game.  IN this deck you want to get one or two piloted starships to each system.  Then if they attack you, you play Out of no where n you&#146;ve got one more destiny.  You can even play it more than once since its no-unique.  But I would only play it once a battle in case they grab it.  You can also barrier them.  Make sure you leave several force for OON and barrier<br>
<br>
Using that method you will get set up very quickly, and start draining fast.  IF they get you by surprise and really come to beat you up, there is a Hyper escape just in case.<br>
<br>
I know what you are thinking, this deck has no land, let me explain.  First of all they aint gonna be draing for a whole lot (test 1).  Secondly you will drain for alot against a deck that concentrates on the ground.  And if they manage to pull of a heavy drain ICBW can handle it.  But you drain for so much in space it isn&#146;t funny.  even if they come to battle you OON stops them.  If they set up in space, you can beat them down easy.<br>
<br>
ONce you finish draining, retrieve using On the edge.<br>
<br>
Deck matchups.<br>
<br>
TDIGWATT and ISB:  test one destroys this deck since it relies on drain bonuses, and your starfleet will cancel the occuaption, nothing to worry about.<br>
<br>
Ties:  Hold down two to three systems and drain there, and beat them down on the rest.  IF they come after you, OON handles it, then OOC their ties and their day is done.<br>
<br>
Dark Combat:  Since you have no land they will be draining for 4 a turn.  No big deal, you drain for a lot more in space.  They dont have a big enough starfleet to handle you.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down:<br>
Get HOTJ out early, let them drain on land and drain them in space, should be an equal game since they wont have anyone to duel except.<br>
<br>
AOBS:<br>
HOTJ gets out, then drain them in space, easy game.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, sorry for the mistakes in this strategy, but its early.  If I missed and matchups you want to see let me know in the review.  Thanks and have a good day. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
