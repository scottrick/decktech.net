<br>
EDIT2*** some people have suggested WIPE them out all of them instead of imperial supply, for anti I DID IT & frozen assets. you can drop one of them and replace it with WTOAOT if you prefer, i like the option of activating 4 force when i need it...its up to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The only suggestion i can think of to change this deck is to replace the db&#8217;s and mob.points with some other locations maybe twixes but no one plays DDTA in my region so i see no need.<br>
 <br>
This deck is well stocked to defeat just about any light deck out there today.with the combined efforts of satisfying imperial decree very easily(with vader and tarkin on one and a walker packed with ISBs on the other)and the drain inhibition from the objective most deck won&#8217;t be able to out drain two drains of 2+ from the 3rd-5th turn.If WYS drops a ship at kessel on the 1st or 2nd turn( a popular strategy down here in aus.) try and eat it for a turn (or use control)and then use zuckuss + high forfiet pilot/passengers +I Had No Choice to dislogde em and reinfore with a stardestroyer and/or Guri. Nevar Yalnal is for blount or corran horn. Also, the objective is even easier to flip b/c of the rebel base locations.merrejk will pull the systems. now for the match-ups: <br>
<br>
WYS: <br>
the decree+ -1 drain w/ ISBs will stop the AO db drains and imperial supply can be used against <br>
the beggar varient. tarkin cancels the fallen portals. stay consolidated and drain at your dbs and their cantina. grabbers + imbalance will kill retrieval. guri makes sure that their multiple destinies on ground or space shuts the down. <br>
P.S don&#8217;t put her with vader because if you do ur a dumb arse.<br>
<br>
EBO: <br>
the dbs will be useless here so you must take over there hoth sites. use walkers + control to stop ice storm and set up decree.watch out for swarms don&#8217;t deploy kashyyk and drain on the ground. it&#8217;ll be slow but the agent retrieval should pull you through. <br>
<br>
HIDDEN MAINS: <br>
start TINTOE instead of decree keep your guys together and drain quick at the dbs. grab their retrievers or cyclers and keep vader and tarkin in hand until they come after you and 4-lom can be vital when he cancels EPP text or helps piss off Jedi Luke.the walkers keep the forfeit rich agents safe from weapons and surprise assault.and play your game not theirs <br>
<br>
TIGIH/scouts: <br>
haven&#8217;t had much experience against this deck type so only general tips here. grab luke to hurt their activation then run to the safety of your dbs then give him to vader asap. decree will stop midge and sabers while 5d6 sitting on endor will slow their drains completely. when they come to you track for trample and divide and conquer with vader and tarkin. <br>
<br>
QMC:<br>
This is not a hard matchup at all since imperial decree shuts pucimeers drains down you dont have much trouble out draining them so just catch their retrieval cards and you will have no problems as vader and tarkin will pick off any non-epp characters on cc.<br>
<br>
I hope you ejoy this deck as much as i have and if you have any complaints d-mail me or tell me in ur review.<br>
thanks.<br>
