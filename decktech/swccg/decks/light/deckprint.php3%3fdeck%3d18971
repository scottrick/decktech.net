Also, I have only 1 Mindful of the Future, and i use it exclusively for pulling the Incinerator, which is necessary for the droid engine.  and i usually get enough battle destiny draws that it doesn&#146;t really matter if they&#146;re high or low.  Thanks for the suggestions and please keep them coming!***<br>

This is not your average EBO deck!!  This is Echo Mains on a grand scale using a broken engine first discovered by PCGSAlucard.  This deck uses a conventional EBO setup, but without ever having EBO or any real space presence.  The systems are only in for Force generation, and possibly for parking the Falcon at with Combined Fleet Action limiting battle destinies at related sites.<br>
<br>
Here&#146;s the fun part: with Echo Base Garrison you pull a maintenance droid, with Faithful Service you lose it instead of 3-4 Force, with the Incinerator you retrieve it, with EBG you pull it, rinse and repeat....you get the idea.  Every droid is worth life Force up to its forfeit value, and they&#8217;re retrievable with the Incinerator (if you occupy).  Then with I Wonder Who... on the impregnable Echo War Room, you get the EPP Main beatdown going to hold the site you deployed Faithful Service on.  So with the Fearsome Foursome and their Tag Team Effects you hold the Faithful Service site, and with Qui-Gon and others you hold the Incinerator.<br>
<br>
Effective Repairs: In case Faithful Service dies or you manage to lose a Main with a helper effect on him/her/it.<br>
<br>
NO EBO???  i don&#8217;t use any of the characters pulled by EBG for deck space reasons, so there&#8217;s little chance of deploying EBO early, and there&#8217;s no point in putting anyone else on Hoth unless they&#8217;re playing Walkers.<br>
<br>
Points of Contention: <br>
Not all the Echo base sites are needed, but right now Force Generation is at the point where I can deploy all 4 mains at once and initiate battle.<br>
I don&#8217;t use How Did We Get Into This Mess, even though EBG provides the perfect setup for it.  the reason is that i could never get all the right stuff in my hand at the right time, so i decided to go with the old standby&#8217;s of Traffic Signal and Yoda Stew.<br>
Jar Jar is in mostly for canceling Visage since he&#8217;s unaffected by Ephant Mon. He can also get your Tag Team into any other blank site.<br>
Red 5 and Gold 1 are in just in case you need the Tag Team at a system, although Gen Lando and Nunb can generally sit at one of your systems with Combined Fleet Action limiting bd&#8217;s for the opponent.<br>
Don&#8217;t forget that when facing a power=4 alien, you can still use Chewie&#8217;s game text if you&#8217;ve got Qui-Gon there to drop their power by 1.<br>
End Of A Reign is for Darth Vader Lord Of The Choke....nothing worse than dropping a Tag Team member during a battle....and Put That Down is for facing Dr. E.  The only defense for Force Lightning is not to battle the Emperor.<br>
<br>
61st card: another Faithful Service.<br>
Well thanks for looking, be gentle with your reviews, and don&#8217;t underestimate the power of surprise!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
