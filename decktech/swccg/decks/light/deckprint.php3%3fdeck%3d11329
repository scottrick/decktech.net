Ill Take the Leader x2 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is currently 16 - 0, with the majority of wins against players with<br>
higher ratings than me. Thats my proof that it can win.<br>
<br>
Do NOT play this deck if you cant track destiny! A couple key destiny adders<br>
should ensure that you win battles if you are tracking your destiny, but you<br>
will lose if you draw low destiny in battles. (On the other hand, if you can track<br>
destiny, you might be able to have Jedi Luke stare down Vader piloting<br>
Blizzard 1, while flanked by Blizzard 2 and Tempest 1, and end up pulling off<br>
Advantage.)<br>
<br>
Note: this deck was designed to be played before Sealed Jabba. HotJedi thus<br>
was meant to kill Visage, etc., until my opponent occupied three<br>
battlegrounds. Then, I would make life difficult for him over at least one of<br>
those battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
Starting. Always start Insurrection, and the other two effects vary.<br>
Typically, youll want Strike Planning and Squadron Assignments, though<br>
against Hunt Down, youll swap out Squadron Assignments for Insight (to get<br>
HotJedi, of course). Against a deck where you might suspect heavy SAC, start<br>
with Wise Advice instead of Squassin. The start of Insurrection, Strike<br>
Planning and Squassin affords the quickest set-up, but the deck can<br>
accommodate some changes if you need to make them.<br>
<br>
The idea is, quite simply, to reduce their drains to zero, or as little as<br>
possible, through the use of Projection and spies. What you cant prevent,<br>
you block with power. Eventually, your opponent will have to fight you<br>
somewhere, and you should manage to get out Advantage or Legendary<br>
Starfighter. If your opponent refuses to fight, you should get in<br>
nickel-and-dime drains and hit him with Order to Engage.<br>
<br>
Match-ups:<br>
<br>
Vs. Hunt Down. I tested this deck several times against my own, very strong,<br>
Hunt Down deck, and this deck came out the winner more often than not. You<br>
dont give away any force early, so the Dark Side takes a bit longer to set<br>
up, allowing you to get something to a battleground and scrap Insight for<br>
HotJedi. You always have to play smart against Hunt Down, but if theyre<br>
dueling, make certain your Luke has a lightsaber. And get Courage into your<br>
hand before you deploy. Also, start tracking those 5s and 6s, getting them<br>
to the top at any point you might be dueled.<br>
<br>
Vs. BHBM. Use Luke w/Saber for the suicide hits until Vader gets<br>
to a battleground, and then give him JK Luke. If youre lucky, maybe someone<br>
will leave Sim Aloo at a site before Vader comes to play, and Luke w/Saber<br>
and Force is Strong can annihilate him. Use Frozen Assets to stop Imperial<br>
Barriers. Track your destiny (in 3s to stop Sim from bugging you), and you<br>
should win the duels, meaning that your opponent should start suffering 1<br>
force each turn as soon as Luke is on their side. Dont lose battles.<br>
<br>
Vs. Ties. Ill take the Leader and Whatre You Tryin to Push? will<br>
annihilate Ties. Your opponent wont drain for much. Get a main to one of<br>
their docking bays to add to your force drains, and just battle them to<br>
death. Aim High also helps.<br>
<br>
Vs. Scum. Frozen Assets to stop Imperial Barriers. Make certain you beat them<br>
down--not the other way. You have limited characters, so you cant afford to<br>
have many captured. Projections will stop their drains for quite a while, and<br>
HotJedi will stop the pain from the Court 0 side. If they put Gailid out,<br>
simply slice him. Push their Projective Telepathy, Imperial Barrier, Hidden<br>
Weapons or None Shall Pass.<br>
<br>
Vs. Endor Ops. Thank your opponent for the early activation. Start the usual<br>
three effects, and get Lando in the Falcon to Endor early. Back him up with<br>
Wedge, Luke, etc. Use Projections to block drains of one, and land characters<br>
in their ships to block bigger drains. HotJedi, once you get it, will stop<br>
the pain from Perimeter Patrol, but deploy en masse, so the beat-down doesnt<br>
come your way the next turn.<br>
<br>
Vs. Anything else. Use Projection, spies and power to stop their drains. Get<br>
out your unholy trio of direct damage (Legendary Starfighter, Advantage,<br>
Order to Engage), and pick away at their life force.<br>
<br>
Of course, this deck is dead now, or would need major tweaking, with the<br>
advent of Jabbas Sealed. But when you rate it, keep in mind that it was<br>
designed to be played before Jabbas Sealed. And if you *actually review* it,<br>
give me some suggestions on how to make it work in the new post-Jabbas<br>
Sealed environment. Thanks.<br>
