<br>
This deck relys on high destinites and afew cards. You dont depend on one strategy and you can change it dependig on your opponent (even during the game).<br>
<br>
Your two main ways to hurt opponent will be inserting (odds + agression) and canceling force draining with surprise asault (which will hurt th opponent). Most cards are wel known and you all know how to use them.<br>
<br>
Youve got a huge power with odds (almost unbeatable 17) so opponent will loose tons of cards. Youll beat some similar decks like cooking Ephant and Skrillings.<br>
<br>
About surprise assault your average destiny is 4.2! (once you played your dbs). Few decks can take that damage and they will be hurt by your odds.<br>
<br>
Anger, fear agression will hurt anyone since you wont let them battle.<br>
<br>
Frozen Assets + effective repairs will force them activate .<br>
<br>
You can also count on retrieval. Death Star Plans and your destinies will help a lot.<br>
<br>
Strange cards:<br>
Droid Shutdown: destiny 6 wich you can recirculate. Also droid protection.<br>
Under Attack: blizzards are a tough matchup for surprise assault. Lukes stick + high	 destinies make it easy.(destiny 6)<br>
Were doomed: great card for last stages. Since Artoos on table you round down!<br>
<br>
I know there some &amp;#8216;anti&amp;#8217; cards for this deck, but Ive never seen all of them together (and they would need them). You can rely on the others to win.<br>
<br>
Opposition:<br>
<br>
Resistance: worst of them all. Ive faced some decks that played this and it was a tough game. Thats why you must be fast hurting the opponent. Once he gets this cards you should rely on were doomed and the other defensive cards.<br>
<br>
CHYBC: bad too. Will stop your retrieval and Lukes force drain (if any) but damage you inflict will be enough (I faced that too with positive results).<br>
<br>
Search and destroy: you should try to stop it with Honor.<br>
<br>
YCHF: wont stop Agression and Assault.<br>
<br>
OK, if opponent combines (and plays) all four cards youre done but I never faced more than two at the same time and that will make it more difficult but possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Know your enemy:<br>
<br>
VS Court: try to take Honor as fast as possible. Yep, I know No Escape but most decks rely on the fear of this card and do not include it. Just try to avoid the Rancor. Easy win.<br>
<br>
VS MKOS: Skrillings are dead and Abyssins will onky hurt when Hutt Influence operational (no surprise) but insertions will hurt them (slower). Death Star Plans will help a lot.<br>
<br>
VS BHBM: Luke will run to his father! His own damage and yours will kill it. Youll win most duels but hell be unable to battle you, so its safe.<br>
<br>
VS TIE swarm: His retrieval cant take all damage. Easy win.<br>
<br>
VS Hunt Down: Try Honor and keep luke away form Vader (Home One db is OK). High destinies would help if you face a duel. Try to get Lost in the Wilderness and hell be dead.<br>
<br>
VS Raltiir troopers: surprise assault them and thats it! Autowin.<br>
<br>
VS Raltiir blizzards: concentrate on scouts for assault and insertions.<br>
<br>
Once more I should ask you for constructive reviews. Im tired of bad ratings without any reason.<br>
<br>
Thanks and enjoy it!<br>
