You can go to the first version (it's on my page) if you really need it. I will comment on the changes that I made.<br>
An extra The Signal went in because it's so important in finding your effects quickly, especially your Projections. An extra Skywalkers was added because they are together a lot, and barriers suck. Plus, it saved my ass by canceling Imperial Barrier 3 times at states! My odds protection is gone. Why? Because no one plays it, unless your name is Clayton. Besides, DS odds have characters, and I whoop up on characters. Docking and Repair Facilities was an excellent suggestion by Eric Hunter. It acts as a Bacta Tank for my starships, letting me continually harass my opponent in space. A Gift of the Mentor was added because it is a great site clearer, and a destiny five. Finally, one EPP Leia was dropped for Boussh because she is more versatile, and can help to cancel Visage, shut down opponent's drains, and do general spy stuff. A few notes about this deck: Search and Destroy does NOT kill it. You can easily clear one of their battleground with an Hit Squad and destiny adders, and then S&amp;D is cancelled. It does hurt, but putting it down doesn't mean that the game is over. My Obi got placed out of play in a duel, and I still won the game easily because I had my Lukes and Leias circulating. Dueling does NOT kill the deck as well, but the protection necessary IS in there. One last note: if you are the least bit in the dark about this deck, do NOT rate it! You can message me first and I will be happy to answer any questions, but I need solid reviews so that I know how to improve the deck. Thanks everyone, and later. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
