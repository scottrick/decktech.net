<br>
to start with you need to get your locations out, all big force generation and none for the dark side except the hologame which is 1. the starting effect makes them pay 3 force and with wars not make one great they have to pay 4 force to drain. projection of a skywalker makes force drain +1 at hologame. do or do not combo is protection from sense and alter.<br>
<br>
jedi presence makes chewie enraged power 18, lando power 12, and the others double as well. try and have qui gon in a battle like this because he`s not a jedi but jedi presence can be played on him to make the others double power. if they have characters at adjacent sites and they have a bit more power than 4, put han down, play bad feeling card, if you win losses are tripled, have luke at adjacent site, play run luke run, don`t get @#$%y- power 12, 3 battle destiny, 1 gun and losses are trebled.<br>
<br>
if they just play in space which is unlikely, you`ve got the falcon, han leia and chewie and the adding battle destiny cards, the power and the damage will hurt them and the outrider for more power and the opponent less. transmission terminated to cancel their holograms.<br>
<br>
for matchups you play the deck the same way, but here is one<br>
<br>
-vs- let them make the first move<br>
deploy your locations and try and get your holograms for draining. wait till they put stuff down. you can decide whether to go and beat down,if you get stuck you can revolution obiwan`s hut, the ruins- both for a force drain of 3, but you really should beat them down. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
