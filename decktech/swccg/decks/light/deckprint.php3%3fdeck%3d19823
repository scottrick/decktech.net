I choosed to start with &quot;only&quot; a Signal, because of the lack of three effect that are immun to Alter in this deck.<br>
Most of the time, i use the The Signal to pull Goo Nee Tay, I made this choice because of the enormous amount of Force Icons i am giving my opponent. Anyway, if you play against something like Court [which makes Goo Nee Tay obsulete] start with Honor of the Jedi [works especialy well against Court]<br>
<br>
Okay, lets take a look at the locations:<br>
<br>
Naboo: Theed Palace Generator Core<br>
Naboo: Theed Palace Generator<br>
These two are pretty clear, because I have to start with them.<br>
<br>
Naboo: Theed Palace Throne Room<br>
Another Theed Palcace Interior site to have fun with, no problem with Qui Gon in the middle of the 3 sites - he can reach everyone.<br>
<br>
Naboo: Theed Palace Courtyard<br>
This site I choosed mainly for the fact that - if the opponent plays the Anti-Nabrun Effect, that i can still leave the planet if I had to.<br>
<br>
Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber<br>
Home One: War Room<br>
Two batteries to speed things up, nice bonus - if a rebel is in the war room the Home One is a little bit cheaper.<br>
<br>
Next Stop: The Characters:<br>
Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight (3x)<br>
Obi-Wan With Lightsaber (3x)<br>
Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master (3x)<br>
The Jedis of your choice - for each interior site one - that worked very well for me. After the palace were cleaned from those Dark Side Jedis.<br>
<br>
Chewie, Enraged (2x)<br>
Han with Heavy Blaster Pistol (2x)<br>
Leia with Blaster Rifle (2x)<br>
Lando Calrissian, Scroundrel (2x)<br>
The support troops, the problem with the objective could be, that you are not allowed to battle where you have a Jedi, so you need a strong non-jedi character base to make some damage.<br>
<br>
Corran Horn<br>
Owen Lars &amp; Beru Lars<br>
Threepio With His Parts Showing<br>
Twass Khaa<br>
These are the supporter of the supporter ;-)<br>
<br>
Toys for the Jedis:<br>
Anakin&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Luke&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Qui-Gon&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
Qui-Gon Jinn&#146;s Lightsaber<br>
I think thats pretty clear, and needs no explanation.<br>
<br>
Space ...<br>
Home One<br>
Not much, but if you play against a DS space deck, you can disrupt with this fighting machine, add Luke, Han, Leia and you have the Super-One.<br>
<br>
The Effects:<br>
An Unusual Amount Of Fear<br>
For sure I want to play with Defensive Shields<br>
<br>
Draw Their Fire<br>
Nice Retrieval, or as a surprise if my opponent has no force left - so he cannot play a interrupts.<br>
<br>
Goo Nee Tay<br>
As I wrote abouth, giving away so much force icons, i need something to compansate it.<br>
<br>
Honor Of The Jedi<br>
Good against Court, HDADTJ and a lot of other stuff.<br>
<br>
Lightsaber Proficiency<br>
Force Drain baby, or a Power 13 Luke ;-)<br>
<br>
Projections Of A Skywalker (2x)<br>
Always a good card, with some options of usage:<br>
Mainly I use it to reduce opponents force drains at their location, but its also a good effect to play if someone invated your palace.<br>
<br>
Interrupts:<br>
Alter &amp; Friendly Fire<br>
One Alter not much, but its worth because of cards like Lateral Damage, Bad Feeling have I and so on - and by the way - A Friendly Fire was always a nasty card ;-)<br>
<br>
A Jedi&#146;s Resilience (2x)<br>
mmm... that needs no explanation.<br>
<br>
Gift Of The Mentor (3x)<br>
To grab those Lightsabers very fast.<br>
<br>
Jedi Presence (2x)<br>
Thats one of the keys to this deck, if you cleaned the palace from dark jedis you can go for it - with cards like Nabrun Leids, High-Power Characters - this card can win you the games.<br>
<br>
Mindful Of The Future (3x)<br>
This card is a must, because your other Naboo Location are not pull-able, so you need this card to get them, anyway, it&#146;s a used destiny of 5, can become handy for lightsaber combat.<br>
<br>
Nabrun Leids (2x)<br>
Thats pretty clear ;-) Beatdown ...<br>
<br>
Run Luke, Run! (2x)<br>
Really perfect if someone tries to battle away that lone EPP Obi Wan on Naboo, also perfect against HD to protect your Luke if he has no combat destinies.<br>
<br>
The Signal<br>
Want to grab my Starting Effect.<br>
<br>
Were You Looking For Me?<br>
C3PO - where are you ?<br>
<br>
We Wish To Board At Once (2x)<br>
Another easy 5 to use, and a nice five for combat.<br>
<br>
The Defensive Shield is pretty clear, so i am not going to explain it card by card.<br>
<br>
Strategy:<br>
Okay, first you should get some Jedis down to make some early damage [force drains]. If necessary reduce his drains with PoaS.<br>
My experienced showed me, that 5 &amp; 6 are enough to do the lightsaber combat - and to win it. <br>
But you can wait with that until he is deploying a Jedi to your sites, because so you have 2 deploy phases to gather those two high destinies.<br>
<br>
If you cleaned the first wave of Jedis you can set your course for revenge. If possible with Nabrun Leids, if not, use EPP Obi and the other task force characters + Jedi Presence. <br>
<br>
In the bad case, you cannot get rid of the Jedi on Naboo, you still can win - because you can attack him elsewhere - with Han, Leia, Chewie &amp; Lando - that could be so devastating ;-)<br>
<br>
I have no idea what i else should i write, because the deck worked for me that way ;-)<br>
<br>
Later !<br>
