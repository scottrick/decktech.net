For those of you who dont know how this works, here it goes:<br>
1st turn: get out Echo Base Garrison and the War Room.	With EBG you pull a Rouge Squadron pilot and put him in the War Room.<br>
2nd turn: get out 2 other Hoth sites and deploy another pilot<br>
3rd turn: get out EBO and start launching your X-wings<br>
<br>
This deck utilitizes the best of the X-wings without S-foils, using cards such as Organized Attack and Incom Corporation.  Incom Corp. is included twice in my deck because it allows me to draw destiny with only 2 x-wings, not 4.  It also raises their power by one.  I havent included any drain 3 systems because I cant pull them and I dont want 0s floating around.  Use Haven at either Hoth or Yavin 4, depending on where you need it most.  I have an underused weapon in here, the Planet Defender Ion Cannon.  It works rather well to keep your opponent from bothering you on Hoth; it can take down the power of star destroyers.  Now for specific strategies against certain deck types.<br>
<br>
vs. Hunt Down: Drain the heck out of them.  Visage will be bothering them more than it will you.  When Vader gets out, kill him.<br>
<br>
vs. ROps: Get control of their planet fast.  Their space fleet will be no match for you.<br>
<br>
vs. Court: Watch out for their starships, especially Zuckuss In Mist Hunter.  Hopefully if they get an easy beatdown on 2 x-wings, you can deploy a bunch and beat them down.<br>
<br>
vs. D*: Tough match.  Save your ICBW and Sense for if they blow up Hoth.  I screwed a deck like this with ICBW.  I was extremely lucky that he had no Its Worse, which is the reason Sense is in here.	Beat down their star destroyers and drain quickly.<br>
<br>
vs. Anything Else: Use the x-wings to drain the heck out of them and use the characters to annoy them.<br>
<br>
Thats all for now.  Please tell me what to take out as well as what to put in.<br>
Thanx!<br>
