I use interrupts like Shocking Information, Out of Commission, Free Ride, etc because they are useful cards besides the cycling 5, they don&#146;t mess up your tracking at all, and they are grabber bait so your opponent doesn&#146;t grab the Off/On the Edge cards, but since I only play with one of each, no dead cards are in my deck if it does get grabbed. Hope that explains it.*<br>
<br>
*I made a mistake on the decklist. EPP Obi x2 should be Ben Kenobi x2.*<br>
<br>
Well, here&#8217;s another failed attempt at a LS deck from me. Didn&#8217;t do poorly in testing or the tournament it played in (5-1 record, 2-1 in the tourney), but I just don&#8217;t like playing it. It&#8217;s not my style. So here it is for you to disect and see if you can&#8217;t help me a little. You should know how this deck works by now, so I won&#8217;t go through that. Instead, I&#8217;ll explain the card choices.<br>
<br>
Balanced Attack: Pulls Ackbar or Obi. Essential to setting up the Super Home One. Also a recylabel 4, which ain&#8217;t too bad.<br>
<br>
Order to Engage: About the only way that this deck can beat TIEs to be quite honest. Their retrieval beats yours, but this card hurts when you park the Home One in front of some ships. Need to fit Aim High in here somewhere.<br>
<br>
Ben Kenobi: I play the Tatooine: Docking Bay, so why not? Besides, he can weild the stick and is too useful with all the Tatooine based Scum decks kicking around.<br>
<br>
Master Luke: See the above comment about all those Scum decks. And I don&#8217;t have any Jedi Lukes.<br>
<br>
Why only 3 ships?: Because that&#8217;s really all you need. Super Falcon is too card intensive for my tastes, plus I need those two on the ground. And I have nothing against RoC/MAiH.<br>
<br>
Why so few sites?: Cause that&#8217;s all you need as well. Easy activation, and they can all be pulled. Brilliant.<br>
<br>
Why 2 Trans Term but no spies?: Cause Ephant Mon is played more than HoloNet and Trans Terms don&#8217;t get beatdown afterwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, hope you enjoyed. Remember, constructive comments only, I don&#8217;t care what the stars are. Later all.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
