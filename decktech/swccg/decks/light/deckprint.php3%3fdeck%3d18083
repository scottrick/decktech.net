<br>
Turn 1- Deploy Corellia Or Kessel From deck. If you can, drop threepio to use his text. Hold smugglers in hand until you can get two at a site. If you play a ship and pilot remember to use the pilots text as well (specifically Mirax).<br>
<br>
Turn 2- Pull the last remaining system in your deck and deplpoy. Opponent should be getting the start of a good force going now. You should be able to deploy your two smugglers from hand to your site and flip. Hopefully you have Han Or Chewie with Talon.<br>
<br>
Turn 3- It all Starts to happen now. Opponent will more than likely begin bringing the fight to you now. Fortify a location and heavily utilize the game text of your admirals order.<br>
<br>
From this point on you should be able to deal with most threats as they occur. I will now discuss individual card choices in the deck. This is in response to the number of people wanting to know why I built the deck the way that I did.<br>
<br>
Out Of Somewhere-It&#146;s a fun card in this deck. &quot;Well darn I don&#146;t have another smuggler at the cantina,&quot; and my opponent drops Darth Vader there and battles. &quot;Oh what&#146;s this? Out Of Somewhere? Chewie to go with Han from the reserve deck?&quot; Well that takes care of that. &quot;While your at it add It&#146;s Not My Fault and Wookie Strangle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Landing Claw- Order To Engage. Direct damage baby!!<br>
<br>
Mercenary Armor- Big bonus in this deck to get power +3, armor 4, and Immunity less than 3! It&#146;s just swinging with the Blasters. Bam!! Draw a 3 for free and Blaster Prof. It for good measure. Plus most of the destinies are more than three, so you&#146;ll be taking out some dark jedi just for kicks. There&#146;s just way too many cool things to say about the armor!<br>
<br>
A Few Manuevers- Want to get that Kessel Run done really fast? Here you go then. Plus TIEs with SFS 9.3 are a lot easier to beat with it since you get to keep your ship on the table more often.<br>
<br>
Intruder Missile- Why you ask? It plays on 4 of your 5 ships. Recirculates it self back into your deck by using it, and is DESTINY 7!! Very cool.<br>
<br>
Why so many of the same admirals order?- Well thats a good question... answer? Destiny 6, it kicks butt in this deck, and destny 6!!! It pretty much works better than more interrupts.<br>
<br>
Fire Extinguisher?- Why 2 of them? It cancels battles, Lateral Damage, and Ion Cannon effects.Using this card opens a big ol&#146; can on your opponents hinnie. Plus it&#146;s  a destiny of 5.<br>
<br>
Quad Laser Cannon- Shoots things. Duh.<br>
<br>
Wookie Strangle- SOOOO much fun to use. And because there&#146;s 2 of them you get to use them 4 times when your flipped.<br>
