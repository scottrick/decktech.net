<br>
the strategy is simple but you need a LOT of practice to be good.<br>
<br>
you train. meanwhile you try to lock the oponent. you have undercover ( test 3 is great to protect TK-422 ) . landing claw. projection of a skywalker. test 1 . ITCBW<br>
<br>
you also have a couple of character to fight. Use them Wisely. You do not want to get beatdown. Even tho you can suicide with on the edge . I usualy fight in late game or very begining to surprise. but i mean you must judge.<br>
<br>
as you will still loose force and your oponent will not loose much (afa). you will think . sh1t that deck suck . but then a couple AFA will have hit him. and you will have done some fight and he will have lots of card on table cause he need to drain at a lot of site to do damage. with all tour damage reductiion sh1t. then you will retrieve. dont worry about secret plans you usualy have nothing to do with your force. CHYBC is good against that deck . but it can easily be counter if you play well. make sure you occupy 2 site as jedi test 5 will be complete. (landing claw might help ) . always try to put that 0-7 (artoo)destiny. <br>
<br>
its so cool . you can say . I try to Hit vader with luke . I topdeck . I take the 0..... OH sh1t... Topdeck again... OH 7 . oh god i am so lucky. <br>
<br>
then you have edge and ICBW . dont forget that Its worst canot be play to increace the lost of card from a force drain if test 1 was complete.<br>
<br>
so i will not put a strategy against all good dark side deck cause its always teh same. DID I SAY GOOD DARK SIDE DECK ???? oh i forgot , there is none good dark side deck. <br>
<br>
well actualy there is only 1 deck that is abel to beat me more that i can beat them ( cause i usualy never loose )... REALLY only 1 ! and its also only when yannick Lapointe play it. but I won&#8217;T say what it is...<br>
<br>
oh yeah. for people that think I loose to space deck . I usualy win by 20 + and most of these time I did not had Any Ship in the deck... i dont even know why i boter playing with ship. anyways i am thinking of removing them and playing some counter-podrace sh1t ... well it depend on the meta<br>
<br>
you must be really patient<br>
