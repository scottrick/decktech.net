		  weekend.<br>
		  Add a copy of your favorite system as your Hidden Base (out of the<br>
		  previous choices).<br>
<br>
		  Basic Strategy:<br>
		  Always start Do, Or Do Not, or Yarna if you feel they are not playing SAC.<br>
		  Get out your systems out as fast as you can and X-Wings to the high drain<br>
		  ones.<br>
		  Tatooine should be your first system to get out, because you can drop an X-wing<br>
		  for fee at RP and then use 1 to move it and drain for 1 second turn.<br>
<br>
		  You should put a Red Squadron X-Wings or RLiR1 at Coruscant, Kiffex,<br>
		  and Kessel.<br>
		  Also, have a Laser Cannon at each of the big three, or at least the big two.<br>
		  These are good for hitting and cutting down those pesky Bounty Hunter<br>
		  ships.   Can make BH ships immediately lost when you use 3 force.  Can kill<br>
		  Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with a destiny draw of 1.  Also Dont forget that S-Foils<br>
		  adds one to weapon destiny on all X-wings when they are in use.<br>
		  The EPP + ECC Mains are there for beatdown. Bacta Tank to save those<br>
		  few characters and redeploy for continuous beatdown or on Redemption for<br>
		  space protection.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  Against certain deck types:<br>
<br>
		  -VS. HDADTJ<br>
<br>
		  Spread out, flip and cancel their few drains.<br>
		  Two copies of Transmission Terminated and It Could Be Worse<br>
		  help against or cancel visage. The destiny in this<br>
		  deck is not the greatest unless you have all the<br>
		  characters and ships out. So avoid dueling (deploying Obi or Luke)<br>
		  unless only your Effects, Interupts, and Cannons are recirculating in your<br>
		  reserve deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. Operatives<br>
<br>
		  Use The Planet Its Farthest From and the flip side<br>
		  of Hidden Base to slow him down, while you drain in<br>
		  space. Also, It's A Hit is good for canceling his drains on a renegade<br>
		  planet.<br>
		  Use Mains as beatdown and park the Redemption at his planet for<br>
		  free ship-docking back down to thier planet. They will eventually lose all<br>
		  their Ops and other Chars.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. COTVG/ISEWYD<br>
<br>
		  Pretty much same as above. Try to control one<br>
		  site with most of your EPP's to avoid losing to<br>
		  his objective. Against good players playing good<br>
		  Court Decks, dont even deploy to Tatooine.<br>
		  It could do you in. It's a Hit and It Could Be Worse<br>
		  are key if you choose to stay away.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. Endor Ops<br>
<br>
		  Get some good X-wing power at Endor to prevent to normal Effects the DS<br>
		  plays with this deck.<br>
		  Flip and drain. Deploy EPP's and wipe out opposition.<br>
		  Only problem I see is if they use a lot of walkers. If this your local-meta<br>
		  then play a couple Mechanical Failures.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. Numbers<br>
<br>
		  DS Numbers around here are about as popular as Jawa Decks are<br>
		  anywhere.<br>
		  Though it seems to be rising in popularity. If this is your local-meta then<br>
		  Ultimatum and Dont Forget The Droids should be added to stop them.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. Manipulation<br>
<br>
		  Flip and Drain. If you deploy right, the Rendevouz Point should make this<br>
		  easy to deal with, besides this deck has enough systems to avoid any real problems.<br>
		  Getting out your EPP's might be a problem. Bacta Tank/ Redemption will<br>
		  be quite usefull here.<br>
<br>
<br>
		  -VS. TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
		  Should be simple.<br>
		  Deploy to Bespin and Bespin: Cloud City and<br>
		  overpower. That right there should shut their objective down.<br>
		  EPP Beatdown should then commence, if possible<br>
		  Although, sometimes this is a bad idea, because<br>
		  your EPP's could get captured, what use is that?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
		  Afterthoughts:<br>
<br>
		  I would add a couple grabbers if I had any, but I dont. My supply of ANH is<br>
		  very low. I will definately add them when I do.<br>
		  All I can suggest is Flip, drain, battle, and that should be good enough<br>
		  against most decks as I think this one is fairly balanced.<br>
		  On a side note. Sometimes it is best not to flip untill the end.<br>
		  Especially if he has alot of ships in his deck.<br>
		  And remeber the power of Hidden Base's power to make them use one<br>
		  before they draw one (I fequently forget) as it prevents people from drawing<br>
		  up, letting you use Traffic Control to boost your differential.<br>
<br>
		  Good Luck and give me an Honest review.<br>
<br>
