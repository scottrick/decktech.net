Ok I was stupid and left out the trench and D*, so take out the liberty(deploy is kinda high for this deck anyways) and tycho(already enough pilots) for the trench and the d*<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, to start game u take madine and mon mothma into hand w/ strike planning.  Deploy Briefing room and madine to it asap.  use madine to pull the two scouts, kensaric and greeves.  put kensaric and Solo if u can get him out to the DB to add deploy and cancel a B destiny.  use the other scout to deploy to another y4 site to flip.  If u don&#146;t have enough force, hold back on solo, just deploy the scouts to separate locations and move them together for protection.  make sure there is an adequete force guarding the war room and breifing room.  the war romm is more important if only one is possible.<br>
Now that u are flipped and rdy to blow stuff up, start by pulling the attack run card and a rebel techie using the obj and mon mothma, assuming u have her out already.  Use the techie to pull the trench, and next turn pull death star and another techie.  Nxt turn pull torps and other techiee.  If u can draw some of this that&#146;s great.  Wow u are already set up for an attack run! whaddaya know?:)<br>
Having haven out does help speed things up, but it&#146;s not necessary.  get Luke in R5 or another replacement to Y4, and tiree in gold 2 always helps.  Hey, even luke and tiree in gold 2 works.  get everything set up and deployed, and move on to the death star and do the attack run on the same turn.  try to track but if u can&#146;t that&#146;s ok.  your destiny should be at least 4(luke&#146;s ability)+2(techies)+3(y4 sites)+1(briefing room)+ 2 destinies.  That adds up to 10, just so ya know.  this can actually be put up to 12 with tiree and the other y4 site, or even 13 if Luke w/ saber is flying lead.  This means u only need a 1 and a 2 to blow up the death star.  KAABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMM!  If u have the light side d* deployed, they lose at least 19, if theirs is deployed, they lose at least 10, which is more like 22 if they are playing SYCFA<br>
At this point game is almost over and u just sit back and drain.  If u had Down w/ the emp in your hand when u blew up the D*, make sure u deploy it so it is impossible for those pesky tie decks to do anything useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
*admirals orders boosts attrtion resistance and helps against tie decks<br>
*Star DEstroyer! is an easily trackable 7<br>
*Fly Casual is a 6 and lets u deploy w/out icons (like to the deathstar)<br>
*2 torps in the unlikel case something happens like getting shot, attrtion, or tallon roll<br>
*antilles manuver is a luke + wedge combo, and lets u pull corellian slip<br>
*corellian slip is anti tallon roll<br>
*intruder missile = destiny 7, and w/ ten numb, it has a shot at hitting even the executor<br>
*kin kian adds to drains and counts as a rogue pilot to work w/ wedge<br>

thx for taking time to read this and gl if u want to try it<br>
