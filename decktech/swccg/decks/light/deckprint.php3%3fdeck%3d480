on the side here and there to see how it's been.<br>
Here comes strategy again :<br>
<br>
v. HDADTJ : start Goo Nee Tay. Duel defense comes<br>
in the form of Courage of a Skywalker , Glancing<br>
Blow , AND Swing and a Miss. Bothans cancel Visage<br>
while It's A Hit stops Elises if Senses are weak.<br>
<br>
v. Ops : Harc Seff and Order to Engage are the new<br>
additions in this deck to revamp it into having a<br>
better chance v. Ops if the one turn kill opportunity<br>
never pops up. Sorry About the Mess keeps ISB's 5d6<br>
off for a turn. Battle Plan should also get a nice<br>
load of work here.<br>
<br>
v. Drazin Manip / CCT Testing : heh. They are sure<br>
gonna have a tough day. Scrambled Transmission<br>
start will have them is a bit of trouble. Wedge gets<br>
to get toted around for awhile. The 2 Shocking<br>
Infos will put the sting on Scanning Crew and the<br>
It's A Hits will also stop the SCrew. Grimtaash is<br>
nice if Drazin ever retrieves anything. Bothans<br>
will help you say hello to Drazin though.<br>
<br>
v. Big Blue : Mantellian Savrip and the Smoke Screen<br>
will earn their due here. SAC can probably give a<br>
decent edge and tracking SInfos is advised.<br>
<br>
v. TIEs : drain when you can otherwise just<br>
load up Falcon and smack them if they spread out<br>
too far. Also you can drive them crazy with Order<br>
to Engage with a loaded Falcon backed by Savrip :)<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous notes : If your scared of ATWYStomach<br>
then don't drain at Toschi Station. Destiny in the<br>
deck is pretty nice also and just try to have fun<br>
while actually having a bunch of interaction. Frozen<br>
Assets can be critical in a game and that'll usually<br>
be the decision where it makes in breaks the game<br>
so choose carefully. Savrip will make up for the<br>
small amount of characters.Draw Their Fire can<br>
retrieve a tremendous amount of cards and SAC<br>
should keep most things off your back. Don't Forget<br>
The Droids will stop #s and you'll be absolutely<br>
amazed at how many times you have the chance to<br>
play It's A Hit ;)<br>
