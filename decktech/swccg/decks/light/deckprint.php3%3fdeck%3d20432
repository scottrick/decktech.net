<br>
This is an episode one deck, but I didn&#146;t post it as such cause it&#146;s beaten a local player who&#146;s ranking is 2032, even with his regular non-ep1 deck.<br>
<br>
The shields are in this deck, but if playing it as only Ep1, only use the Ep1 shields.  Otherwise, play the others as much as normal.<br>
<br>
Aight, this deck is easy to play if you understand how it works.<br>
<br>
First off, you win, gaurenteed, as long as you can get Boss Nass down.  Spies aren&#146;t played much in my area lately (cept mara), so if you feel threatend, put a Gungan Gaurd with Boss.<br>
<br>
Aight, this deck starts Brisky Morning Munchin to pull Jar Jar.  This is key, because that means that once Boss Nass is down, you&#146;re pulling two Gungans a turn (one of which will always be JarJar).<br>
<br>
As far as podracing - well - you should win.  Grab Podracer Collession if it feels like the right thing to do.  I&#146;ve won games where I&#146;ve lost the podrace.  Against Invansion though, REALLY try to win the podrace as you&#146;ll need as much force retrieval as possible.<br>
<br>
You run Lightsaber Combat because with Meta being so Jedi friendly for both sides, if they really want to do much in their games, they&#146;ll be forced to come to Naboo.  Also, Inner Strength is the only real way to beat DS Combat, so, this lets you start it right out.  <br>
<br>
Remember, Boss Nass only adds a destiny if there are only Gungans on Naboo. So, if you have Jedi&#146;s in your hand, wait, and only deploy them when you NEED them.<br>
<br>
Wesa Got a Grand Army can pull both your sites and your sites alone give you a drain of 6, 8 if you get Steady, Steady working.<br>
<br>
The deck is pretty simple and explanitory.  Basically, just get them to Naboo (easy to do since you start combat) and then beat the heck outta them with cheap deploy gungans.  <br>
<br>
Remember, you are no match for Maul and his doublesided saber.  Let them deploy first for the most part, and if Maul gets to the location where any character of ability &lt; 5 is hit, they&#146;re sent to the used pile - well - STAY AWAY FROM THAT SITE WITH GUNGANS.  It&#146;ll be the death of you.<br>
<br>
Just deploy a Jedi either to an addjacnt site, or to simply beat them up.<br>
<br>
Matchups - <br>
<br>
DS Combat - this is the easist win, as it requires the opponent to be in your playground.  Deploy gungans to beat up characters and use Jedi&#146;s when it&#146;s too dangerous for your Gungans.  Hence, stay away from Maul with doubleboomstick, and stay away from the Emperor (force lightning is a @#$% - unless you grab it).<br>
<br>
Invasion - the only way Invasion wins is by owning the Throne Room, making it your objective to clear it out.  Get Boss Nass down ASAP and attempt to clear them out.  Hang in there and win the podrace to retrieve.  There&#146;s no battledroids that really &quot;hurt&quot; gungans, but the blasters hurt like a @#$%.  Do what you can to clear them out and don&#146;t let them flip.  In this game, remember that sometimes a Jedi&#146;s power is better than drawing two destiny.  It&#146;s hard for an unflipped Invasion deck to clear out a person who&#146;s completely immune to attrition.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down - a little trickier.  Get them to come to Naboo (they can&#146;t do anything anywhere else) and surprise them with gungan beat down.  Keep Obi and Qui Gon away, use Mace and Ki Adi for stuff as Maul and Vader will be looking for Duels.<br>
Also, with Steady, Steady down, they may go there to clear you out of a drain for four location.<br>
<br>
Space - easy win, as nothing can stop your run of characters.  Win the podrace and whipe the floor with &#146;em.<br>
