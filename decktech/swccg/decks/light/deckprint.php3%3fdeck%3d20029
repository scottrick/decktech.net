I figure that with only nine starships, I can&#146;t hold both Kiffex and Kessel, and Kessel is a better deal for me. I actually play a very conservative strategy when it comes to my choice in systems. I have tried to choose ones that I can afford to lose control of without it hurting me too bad. If I&#146;m unopposed in the air, I can put Theron Nett at Ord Mandell and Kin Kian anywhere for a force drain bonus. If conditions are right, I can really beatdown in the air with Slight Weapons Malfunction, Power Pivot, and Darklighter Spin. All I need is a fighter with a weapon. Slight Weapons Malfunction is great because it also works with some of my characters with weapons on the ground, which are already in like Flynn at the Forests. I have two Signals because I want all of my effects to get out, play Haven on Sullust. To deal with probing, I always keep a few ships at Sullust. In response to this, the enemy will probably try to deploy there (+1), probe, and move away all in the same turn. Rebel Barrier fixes that, and I smash them mercilessly for coting me my objective. To get them take this bait, I try not to play Rebel Barrier before that, unless it&#146;s absolutely necessary. Well, I think that&#146;s about it. Thank you for your time.       </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
