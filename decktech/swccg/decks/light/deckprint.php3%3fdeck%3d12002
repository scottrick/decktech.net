<br>
Well, after my first speeder deck did so well for a while, I decided to make some others.  They, however, did not do so well.  This is my revised speeder deck, and it uses JPSD cards to get an advantage over your opponent.	Wioslea will be your Rep, and him and the Droid Merchants are there for Spaceport Speeders, which will give me killer activation for my beatdowns.  Not that I need to activate that much...<br>
I chose docking bays because I can pull them and I can move more easily.  The Wedge, Luke and Zev are for retrieval with Noble Sacrifice.  Tycho and Jeroen can retrieve as well, but their main purpose is to invade twix sites to deliver a painful game-ending beatdown.  The ASP droids lower most of the speeders costs to an incredible 0, one of the reason I chose Rebel Snowspeeders over Snowspeeders.  Another reason is because of the higher destiny.  They have one less power than the Sandspeeders, but it doesnt matter once theyre power 5 for deploy 0 with Maneuvering Flaps and Incom Corporation with an ASP droid.  The Engineers are there to boost destiny and give immunity.	Dual Laser Cannons are mostly there to be used in conjunction with Desperate Tactics, giving you another battle destiny.  Use the grabbers to grab Sense and Alter, they can get annoying after a while.  Crash Site Memorial is just awesome, if they survive your one-turn beatdown, you can put your speeders in there instead of the lost pile.  On the the Deck to Deck strategies:<br>
<br>
vs. BHBM:  Give them Luke early,  try to find a lone guy and kick his butt.  Try not to lose battles.  They will be sensing/altering like mad, so grab them.  If they deploy the Emperor alone to an exterior site, kick his butt and hopefully hell be there next turn for more beats.<br>
<br>
vs. Hunt Down:	Kill Vader, sen0003spy to cancel Visage.  Try to get a lone beatdown.  Dont battle at sites where he has a buttload of forfiet.<br>
<br>
vs. Scum:  Should be an easy game.  Their weapons usually cant shoot vehicles and you dont need to worry about creatures, either.  Their low forfiets are just icing on the cake.  Destroy them.<br>
<br>
vs. SYCFA: A harder game, since they take no damage on the Death Star.	Try to lure their guys off the space station, then beat down.  If theyre going for space, dont worry about them and try to drain them out.<br>
<br>
vs. TIEs: They wont retrieve too much since their TIEs wont be dying and coming back.  Just drain on the ground and try to ignore them.  If they come after you, kick their butts.<br>
<br>
vs. Endor Ops:	This deck has a suprising amount of trouble against Endor Operations decks.  The space drains get to you, Perimeter Patrol sucks, and a Speeder trooper, Sgt. Elesk (sp?), can be forfieted to cover all damage then retrieved into hand with Cardia.  This is extremely annoying.  Invade their DB through Home One if they have Perimeter Patrol out.  Watch out, be on your feet.  This is the hardest matchup for this deck, period.<br>
<br>
vs. RalOps:  Its dead, but just in case... only your Engineer is vital to your beatdown and has his deploy boosted.  Everything else is the same.  Shouldnt be too hard.<br>
<br>
Well, thats it.  Tell me what to take out and what to put in.  Happy reviewing,<br>
