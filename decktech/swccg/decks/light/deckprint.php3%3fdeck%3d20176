<br>
<br>
Get Yoda and Leia to Dagobah and start the Jedi Training. Han, Chew and the Falcon + Home One can take care of space, with R2D2 in Red 5 also there if you needd it. <br>
<br>
Use EPP Qui- Gon, EPP Luke and EPP Obi for hit and run attackes on your opponent. With Chewie &amp; Lando as back up. Jar Jar just deploys anywhere and drains your opponent and kills his characters. When EPP Qui- Gon and Obi die, use a Jedi&#146;s Resilience to take them into hand, then deploy them again the next turn. Should one of the other guys like Lando or Chewie die, just send them to the Bacta Tank.<br>
<br>
Why On The Edge? <br>
<br>
It&#146;s just in there for added retrieval, as after you complete some of the tests, you should have a stacked 7. If you don&#146;t have a card stacked on Jedi Test 5 yet, then wait till you have only 1 card in your reserve deck and then search for a Jedi Tests or Dagobah site or some other card you know you won&#146;t find, that way you what the destiny number is. Then use on the Edge to get some force back. <br>
<br>
Why Out of Commission? <br>
<br>
Just to reduce the amount of force your opponent can retrieve, and maybe even place some of his good cards out of play. Deploy EPP Qui- Gon, battle Maul, swing the saber and hit him, causing him to die, then Out of Commission him after the battle. <br>
<br>
Why Podracing? <br>
<br>
the people in my area who use MWYHL decks, seem to play podracing in their decks, so I might as well to. As if your opponent doesn&#146;t podrace, more retrieval for you and more force loss for him. <br>
<br>
Why C-3PO? <br>
<br>
<br>
this is just in there for the recycling of un wanted cards.    <br>
<br>
<br>
Why EPP characters and not regular ones? with EPP characters like Obi &amp; Luke, it saves space, so you can have like 2X EPP luke instead of 2X Jedi Luke and 1x his saber. It also means that when you play A Jedi&#146;s risilience, you will get back both the characters and weapon, instead of just the character.  <br>
<br>
Combo&#146;s <br>
<br>
EPP Qui- Gon + either EPP Luke or Obi= mega power, as EPP Qui- Gon &amp; Luke can clear out a site by themselves. <br>
<br>
<br>
Matchups<br>
<br>
VS Hunt Down<br>
<br>
Use Jar Jar to cancel visage and suicide bomb his guys. Whil your other guys deploy to his sites and beat him down. <br>
<br>
<br>
VS. Scum <br>
<br>
If he plays aliens and Imperials or just Aliens, use your 3 EPP characters to clear out his sites. That startegy works, as  have played many people that tried that and it worked. 1 Guy used epp Luke and epp Qui- Gon to clear out a site that had Darth maul, Mara Jade, Pote Snitkin and 2-3 Skrillings. With the Jedi&#146;s Resilience and Bacta Tank, you can get your EPP characters back and clear out his sites faster then he can get his guys out. <br>
<br>
<br>
VS. DS Saber Combat<br>
<br>
Don&#146;t go to his Naboo sites, unless he has no other sites and then when you do, kick his rear end and if you duel, try and kill off his Dark Jedi by winning the duels. Your destiny 7 cards should help.  <br>
<br>
<br>
VS. Set Your Course for Alderan<br>
<br>
<br>
Beat him up in space, drain, battle and retrieve. <br>
<br>
<br>
VS. other decks<br>
<br>
<br>
Use your Ground crews for hit and run attacks, drain him when possible, retrieve with on the edge and your objective, win the race and win the game. <br>
<br>
NEVER battle if you know you won&#146;t be able to win the battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
This deck is 4-2 for me right now, it has beated DS Dueling, Hunt Down &amp; Scum, but it has also lost to DS Dueling and the Agents of Black Sun deck. <br>
<br>
The only major problems it has, is some of those shield cards, mainly CHYBC &amp; the shield that can grab your interrupts or hurt your retrieval. <br>
