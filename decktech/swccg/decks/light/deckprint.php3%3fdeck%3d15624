xxx- the entire point of this deck is that your opponent is expecting something else and holds his catch card to wait for on the edge so as not to get your control/tv that is the most important thing to get you early setup<br>
<br>
Okay, let me start off by saying I have been playing this deck for the past 2 months and through 4 tournaments, I have lost a grand total of 1 times, a timed loss to a friend of mine, total record is 10-1 in tournament play including goin undefeated in MI states winning by 20, 26, and 30 force.  The deck is simple defined you don&#8217;t need to track to retrieve you just control Tatooine, very esay to do and hold maybe 2 sites and you have the game.  despite the weak looking character base and no Jedi Luke( I figure if I play him HDs gonna duel me anyway and it gives me an advantage vs BHBM cause of the low ability, and he rules in space) This deck holds ground with ease in near all cases, you avoid any mass of opponent&#8217;s powerful chars and use your High destiny and fallen portals to handle attacks, so far, whoever has gone to the cantina vs this deck has died there, cantina brawl with Karrde is the best.  you xwing Lasers deal with zuckess and dengar and guri ont eh stinger, power pivot kills chimera so you have a strong space presence, Bantha Droid will deal with lateral damage in his own special way, canel it.<br>
Matchups<br>
BHBM<br>
Not very hard flip, back up you chars, force choke and sit back, wait for them to attack, use barrier and fallen portal to blunt their attack and deal out massive attrition, not a very hard matchup<br>
Ties<br>
A difficult matchup but not that bad, get your order out and keep it out by saving your second one, xwing cannons, power pivot make battles hard for you opponent to win, or keep their fighters alive to fight IHSA comes out, you hold tat with bantha droid preventing lateral damage drain them more and celeb to retrieve<br>
Court/Mkos<br>
Not very hard, your fallen portals will own this game and court won&#8217;t stand up in space with your cannons and power pivot running around, once again use barrier as needed and kill with attrition, not very high forfeit and 2 draws kill at least 2 or 3 guys while your mad forfeit holds ground<br>
HDADTJ<br>
First of all Luke never comes down, that&#8217;s just what happens, OOC/TT kills visage with 2 of them it&#8217;s not hard to get and can kill from lost pile again fallen portal and avoid attacking large mains, make him come to you and attrition kills him while you forfeit rules yet again<br>
<br>
Notice a Theme here? you stay back play defensive and use super forfeit and draws to pull it out.  Not a hard deck to keep track of what&#8217;s going on but it is hard to play as you need lots of patience.<br>
<br>
In States <br>
The deck beat a soild BHBM which endedup third with only 2 loss<br>
A Dueling HD<br>
MKOS abyssins<br>
<br>
Beat them all with ease and I know if you look at it it seems shaky but it&#8217;s on of the most solid decks around, Simple as can be<br>
<br>
Due to a dismal performance with my DS I finished at 5th Place overall and went 4-2 with LS(3-0) and DS(1-2) I hate Profit but that&#8217;s another deck  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
