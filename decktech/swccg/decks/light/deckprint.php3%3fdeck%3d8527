You starting with Insurrection pull LPlatform. Your starting with Staging Areas fo first turn character (Madine at least) goes there for +2 activation next turn. Your starting Strike Planning which lets you deploy 2 Generals from reserve (Madine and Gen Solo). Madine comes out and pulls a scout per turn. First scout he pulls is Panno which adds 2 to generation at each endor BG site you occupy (limit 4). Second scout is CoKashyyyk (Solo is coming out anyway). CoK pulls Wuta who pulls Endor sites. Third scout to pull is<br>
Midge who adds 1 to drain at each endor site with a rebel of ability &gt;2 and no ewok. That other interrupt card you don't know what is says that if you have a scout in a battle at an exterior site opponents total battle destiny is -3 (It's a used 6)Here's how the first two turns break down:<br>
<br>
<br>
Start-(Endor,Reb Landing Site)Staging Areas,Insurrection,Strike Planning<br>
<br>
Turn 1-<br>
A:5<br>
Deploy from reserve-Landing Platform<br>
Deploy from reserve-Bunker (2)<br>
Deploy from reserve-Gen Crix Madine (3)<br>
*If opponent gives 2 force deploy Major Panno w/ Madine<br>
<br>
Turn 2-<br>
A:8 (12 if opponent gave us 2 force)<br>
Take DTSG into hand (2)<br>
Move both over to bunker (2)<br>
Save/Draw (4)<br>
*If opponent now gives 1 force (A:9) then deploy CoK and move all 3 to bunker.<br>
*If oponent gives us 2 force NOW (A:10) deploy Wuta from reserve and leave him and CoK and LP moving Strike Team in.<br>
*If opponent gave 2 force then deploy Wuta and Back Door from reserve. Leave CoK and Wuta at LP and move the Strike Team in (12)<br>
<br>
The rest is proceed as you can...too many variables for me to plan for. Gen Solo, Chirpa's Hut, and Midge come out if possible. Delevar (ouch. no reduction in forfeit=huge cause you lose like 1 guy per battle then retrieve him with text) is big. Chewie is out might as well give him the walker killer (well...2 des &gt;than vehicle armor=vehicle hit and forfeit=0)<br>
<br>
Avg Des with all cards in=2.7<br>
<br>
Here's how and WHY this deck is so good:<br>
<br>
ROps-Well...you flip around same time they do, cept that now your drains are unmodifiable, +1,your scouts will have overall immunity &lt;6, and you can toss/retrieve a scout for one of their drains. It eats them alive...It's so pretty.<br>
<br>
EOps-Endor Operations is getting a huge boost in D*II, expect to see a lot of them. I don't think it will be hard controlling 3 endor sites ; ) Especially when your blowing the bunker..which more often than not they'll deploy to first turn. This deck just..wipes it's ass with what will be a popular deck.<br>
<br>
SYCFA-They give you the 2 force you need to get rolling. THUS your deck is even faster against this. Dense Forest and Chewies caster=Anti-Walker tech. The -3 destiny interrupt hurts already low draws...it's just so pretty. With characters coming from reserve (All scouts and 2 Generals) no need to worry about Manip.<br>
<br>
D*II Objective- So you get Luke out early...they're gonna have a rough time winning lots of battles with cool scout text. Kill Vader off with your shiznit while Luke chill's at like, chirpa's hut.<br>
<br>
HDADTJ- It's dead. Honor of the Jedi, CoK+Gen Solo eatin a destiny+plenty of forfeit and psycho drains=rippped in half. If they try to spread for HotJedi wack them.<br>
<br>
Muahahahaha. Yes...there is a playable LS Endor deck. Sickening isn't it?</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
