***UPDATE***<br>
If you want you can take out a rebel leadership for either an Tantive 4 (to deploy to Death Star), lando in falcon, or another scout. I have found that i do not use that many times per game and one is enough if i track.<br>
<br>
***UPDATE***<br>
Yes i do have enough activation in here. I have played it many times and have never been short. This deck activates tons and does not need more.<br>
<br>
***UPDATE***<br>
HOME ONE HELPS A LOT. It is very good in my strategy. Just wait and make sure you are safe. It will help and may be an eventual game winner. Also if No Escape on table just dont deploy SP: Docking bay. Home One is really the only space I NEED. IN my area the home one with those characters and some scout pilots aboard you can hold a system for most of the game. If you feel like you need more space Do not take off points just change it to your liking, becuase in my meta tons of space is not needed.<br>

This is TIGIH at its best. This is the version that I use now and I hope that you will like it so here goes:<br>
<br>
TIGIH= The objective that was thought to suck just about 9 months ago. It was not used, but I seem to think that almost all of the cards in this deck were around then. What changed? The whole SWCCG universe changed and finally realized that this was an objective to be reckoned with.<br>
<br>
The reason this objective and style is so good is the fact that it is so fast so I will go over the strategy on how to play a great TIGIH:<br>
<br>
1. Your first goal is to go get your generals during your opponents turn. Then during your turn get out Home one docking bay, deploy crix there, get out chewie, deploy him to endor docking bay, get out wuta with chewie, deploy him for free then move LUKE over and draw remaining cards.<br>
<br>
2. Second turn is a vital turn too. Deploy your other general (solo) with chewie, get out Back door with wuta, Get out a scout (one of the spies) and stick him with crix, deploy any other characters or helpful items, and move squad over to back door, DRAW for a double agent and fallen portal.<br>
<br>
3. Drain, Get out a scout (midge?) deploy her/him? At docking bay, deploy any other characters, if you want move crix down to docking bay and spread out some forces so midge does her thing, draw.<br>
<br>
After that just play your game and you will most likely win. It is a very good deck, that will win almost against anything thrown at it. JUST PlaY SmaRT  and TRACK!!!<br>
<br>
Reasons for some cards:<br>
<br>
Sp. DB- Very useful to get over to raaltiir or tatooine or anything. Helps in most games.<br>
<br>
Mirax Terrik- Shes not a scout, but she is hot and helps tracking. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
The Fishy Trio and Home One- With these and rebel leadership (ill explain) you should be able to hold atleast one system and surprise the opponent. Also helps satisfy battle order.<br>
<br>
Kal Fal- This can be very helpful because after your scouts and sites are out the destiny in this deck is incredible.<br>
<br>
Order to engage- I did not originally have this in here, but after playing several times I have discovered that if opponent thinks you have a fallen portal they will not battle and will want you to battle. This helps a lot in most games.<br>
<br>
Bacta Tank- Recycle scouts and that hot biatch mirax. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Ounee ta- Incredible against ROPS and Sp Docking bay.<br>
<br>
I hope she is allright- kills ties<br>
<br>
OOC/TT- Very helpful against huntdown and ties to place things out of play.<br>
<br>
Bith Shuffle/ Deperate Reach- Kills barrier and very greatly hampers tracking in huntdown.<br>
<br>
Rebel Leadership - This is one of my favorite cards. I do not know why more people do not use it. I have been wanting to use it since I saw it and imperial command but could not find a way. I also thought that people would bash it if they saw it in a deck so I never really used it. After seeing Scouts of Doom I finally realized I should use it. It really helps in space with the SUPER HOMe ONE, and on the ground with crix and solo.<br>
<br>
On the edge- These can be very good. With so many trackable sixes in here you should be able to retrieve a lot of force.<br>
<br>
I really want to use sense alter protection but I cannot find any room. Try to help me find what to take out. OK now onto matchups:<br>
<br>
Ties: this is a very tough matchup. Ties are very good and are hard to beat. You will want to use a lot of OOC to stop some retrieval. Get down fast and hold double agent. Get corran down because there will be undercover spies. Set up big drains so that you can make them lose a lot of force. Send in the home one to clear a system and then just sit there. Hopefully at a drain for 2 or death star. Deploy I hope she is all right and make them lose force. You will have to retrieve smart and play your best to beat this. Also if they play Endor remember they may not deploy ominous rumours while you occupy an endor site. So just stay strong.<br>
<br>
Huntdown- This is another tough matchup. You will want to cancel visage fast and furiously. Deploy scouts at a rapid rate so you do not get a fast beatdown. Hold FALLEN PORTALS, and Double agents because you will need them in almost every turn of the game. Your opponent will not be able to dual Luke, so you are safe from that. You may want to caution deploying OBI till you know that he is not dualing, because a well placed dual can win him the game. You must play very smartly. Do not leave characters alone and just try to retrieve and drain him out. Also I have playtested this deck many times versus huntdown and i advise not deploying EPP Obi because Every time i lost to it was a big late game dual. Also watch out for mara. Back a spy with Luke so another well placed vaders obsession does not lose you the game.<br>
<br>
BHBM: I think that this is almost and autowin. He will not dual, because if he does I will win every time and will get a new cards. You want to give him luke fast and just win battles. This is a rather easy matchup. Just pick your playstyle and you should be able to destroy it.<br>
<br>
Scum (all sorts)- Just play your game on Endor. You will most likely drain him for more than he can drain you, and will be forced to come to endor. Hold fallen portals, because they can be useful in the audience chamber if you decide to invade them. Pick your battles carefully and you will win the game. He will most likely not use vader, and if he does (Atkins CCT skrillings) just try to cross Luke. You will want to retrieve fast and furiously and drain him out. You should win. Remember Kill the person transporting frozen han and you can then deploy General Solo. This is not a very hard matchup and fallen portals will be huge.<br>
<br>
ISB- This is rather tough. Get out the ISB killers and stick blunt in home one to sit at couruscant and keep them flipped. Hold Coruscant for as long as possible. Drain him for as much as you can and if he comes to battle use fallen portal and just beat the living piss out of him. You may want to throw in a Tantive 4 for help with the home one. Holding the Coruscant system can win you the game since all Imperials are deploy +2. Fallen Portal Is also great against Agents. Just hang out and he will most likely run from battles so Order To Engage will Help A lot. I Know that ISB can be tough because i have been playing against some lately. For a good example check out Cowboys from Hell.<br>
<br>
Well this is my favorite deck ever and I give mad props to:<br>
Crash Beedo- For showing me that Rebel Leadership is a good card as I always knew.<br>
My Mentor- Tom *123* Scott- For helping me make this deck what it is. Milford 1 Rulez<br>
