So does Incom.  With Incom out and Maneuvering Flaps on, most speeders are power 6!!!! All for 2 deploy!!  Crash Site Memorial is just tech, like a vehicle Bacta Tank except better.	3 spies to infiltrate opponents twix locations.  Incom Engineers are awesome, adding speeder immunity and 2 to a battle destiny draw.  5 locations, but they can get up to 3 activation at each.  I might want to add in an Ice Storm, but I dont know if its worth it.  Now on to the general strategies:<br>
<br>
BHBM:  Give them Luke when they get out vader, or beat down on Vader with your speeders.  Try to win battles.  If you want, you can try to go after the Emperor with your characters, but its not advisable.  Battle them to death, or drain them at their sites.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down:  Try to beat up Vader again.  Try to deploy Luke ASAP.  Use a spy to cancel Visage.	Speeders beat down any character that gets in your way.<br>
<br>
ROps:  Easy game.  They use a lot of low-power Imperials, and your speeders deploy costs are normal.  Should be even easier after JPSD, with the effect that makes my deploy -3 to &lt;&gt; sites.<br>
<br>
TDIGWATT:  Not really played in my area, but Ill try to cancel Dark Deal.  Hopefully theyll use their DB, so I can control 2 sites with speeders and 1 with characters.<br>
<br>
Court:	If they try to flip, dont worry.  Keep your guys in the speeders.  Theyll have no chance against you.  If they dont, try to drain and win battles.<br>
<br>
SYCFA:	If they use Mioom, dont worry.	You can kill her with destiny draws.  Try to battle them, and win.  Might be harder because they take no damage at the Death Star.<br>
<br>
TIEs:  I really havent seen this deck used in my area, though it would be the hardest matchup.	Just try to drain, and if they deploy anyone, beat the living crap out of them.<br>
<br>
Well, thats it.  Please give me suggestions, as those are important to me.  Happy reviewing!<br>
