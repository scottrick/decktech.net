All I have to say is, wow Rypcord, WTF is wrong with you.  The mere fact that this deck is outdated--a deck which I posted, what, a year ago?--doesn&#146;t mean that you have to go and rate it 1/2 a star.  What a jerk. Don&#146;t be surprised if I delete your review.<br>

***UPDATE***<br>
To adrock: You must be smoking a lot of weed or something.  Against BHBM and Hunt Down you say I haven’t factored in their drains?  Um... read the flipside of my objective.  Canceling drains is kinda the POINT of the deck.  Besides that, I have undercover spies, Projection of a Skywalker, and Rebel Fleet to halt their drains.  Between all that, I cancel  BHBM and Hunt Down drains and get an auto-win if they don’t have space, because those decks usually just do the standard 2-3 docking bay strategy.  In summary, I CAN CANCEL DRAINS.<br>
***END UPDATE***<br>
<br>
First of all, sorry the interrupt list says 15 but it’s only 14.  Count ’em if you want.<br>
Alright, the basic game plan here is to get out all or at least most of your systems ASAP and drain the crap out of everything.  It’s important to pick just the right time to flip, so that you can start canceling big drains when they start to hurt, but not early enough to give him a good opportunity to probe your hidden base successfully.  The deck has one or two systems more than a typical hidden base, but I’ve found that this gives you very good psychological leverage in the whole probing mind game.  If there are only 4 or 5 possible systems for your hidden base, your opponent can spread out with confidence and get it pretty easily with a ghhhk or security precautions.  But if you have 6-7 possible systems (6 in this case), the task of probing seems slightly more overwhelming for the opponent.  Anyway, in the early game get systems out and x-wings to rendezvous point.  Use Projections and Boushh/TK to slow early drains.  Ultimately, right before you flip, you’ll want to set up at kessel and coruscant with 7 x-wings at one and maybe home one or red leader at the other with some x-wings.  Getting out x-wings really isn’t too hard with all wings report in and organized attack lost.  I’ve included 4 org attacks because both functions kick @#$% in the deck.  After you get out your stuff just drain for 3 at each place.  If he comes to space, use Order to Engage to hurt him for 3 a turn and BEAT HIM DOWN!  With s-foils and organized attack, each xwing becomes power 6 and immune to attrition for a deploy of 2.  I’ve ended many games with sick beatdowns using tons of buffed up x-wings.  There are too many dark decks for me to cover individually, I think, but basically if he comes to space, beat him down and use OTE, and if he doesn’t, you can drain him out.  Hold Kiffex for another drain of 2 if you need to.  This deck can and will beat hunt down: just don’t give him luke or obi (use them with mantellian savrip, which is a killer card), screw his docking bay drains on ground and drain him in space.  OK, so you lose 4 a turn to visage and search + destroy, but you drain him for 6 or 8 a turn.  BHBM is basically the same deal, except this time it’s easy because you can give him luke right away for the extra 1 loss per turn.  Make sure you have your systems heavily fortified so you don’t lose too many battles to let him convert for the win.  All wings report in for late game retrieval obviously.  You may not like traffic control, but I like building a big hand and I like my diff points.  Everything else is pretty self-explanatory.  Often start do/wise and insight for honor, but sometimes you can signal for something cool like rebel fleet or s-foils if your opponent has a deck that doesn’t need honor or ties and lots of battling in space.  This deck has always served me well.  Please rate fairly, and thanks for reading the whole strategy.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
