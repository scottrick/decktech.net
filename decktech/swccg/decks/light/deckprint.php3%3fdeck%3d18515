I brought this to a tourney and it went 2-1.  It beat an ISB YMSYL deck and a SYCFA mains deck.  It lost to court, but only because they invaded my Jedi Council Chamber and the Rancor ate Yoda.  Also, don&#146;t say I don&#146;t have enough senators in here.  There&#146;s only 1 more senator, and his special ability is useless in this deck.  Also, I don&#146;t have room for senators.  <br>
END UPDATE<br>
<br>
This is my first LS senate deck.  I’m posting it because I think it’s just about the best the LS can do in the Senate.  Many people think this is an auto-loss to DS senate.  However, this is only partially true.  It’s only an auto-loss to a good DS senate deck, played well by a good player.  Sometimes you might get lucky, anyways.  It uses 4 senators and 2 other characters with politics, along with Stay Here, Where It’s Safe.  This should give you an edge in the Senate.  Bacta Tank will help, too.  <br>
Remember to use the Senate part, too.  Though mostly used for an activation and drain platform, use the flipped text, as well as the senator’s.<br>
This deck does fairly well against Podracing.  One of it’s losses was to an AOTBS racing deck that Hit Racer me 3 times, Podracer Collisioned me once, and damaged my racer.  I still almost beat him (in the race, anyways).  <br>
It has fairly decent dueling protection against Hunt Down.  It also has 3 OOC/ TT best used against Hunt down, but the OOC is useful against anybody.  <br>
I used to have Shmi’s Hut and Shmi, but I took them out for a Yoda and Bacta Tank.  I only get 1 less activation.  <br>
R-3P0 is my ISB protection.  If all their Agents are spies, that’s a lot of damage.  <br>
Many of the political figures can be used outside the senate, as well.  Yarua has a nice power of 5.  <br>
The Bith Shuffle/ Desperate Reach is in there to cancel Imperial Barrier and screw with their tracking.  <br>
Gift of the Mentor is a logical choice with 2 sabers and also 2 lukes and obis.  <br>
Blaster Deflection helps keep your Jedi alive when Maul comes a-swinging.  <br>
We Wish To Board At Once is like The Signal that can also pull podrace interrupts into hand.  <br>
Nabrun is in here even with Insurrection.  He can still be useful to move characters to a planet I don’t have a DB at.  <br>
Weapon Lev. is logical with 2 weapons.  Against that AOTBS deck, I used it to steal Snoova’s Vibro-axe.  Traffic Control is for end-of-game differential boosting.<br>
Bacta Tank is to keep your characters alive.<br>
Advantage can do some serious direct damage against your opponent.<br>
Plea to the Court cancels my opponent’s annoying drains.<br>
Revo is just for fun and more activation.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
AOTBS:  If they’re racing, you have a chance of winning the race, which severely cripples them.  Try putting out Luke or killing Xizor.  Also, beat down on their characters as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Court:  Practically an auto-win.  Use tat. Qui-guy to cut their power, Lando to add destiny, etc.  Ben will be pretty helpful if they don’t have All Wrapped Up out.<br>
<br>
DS Senate:  Play to the best of your ability.  This is by far the hardest matchup.  The Senate is the key.  If they control the senate, you will lose.  Kick their butts in the senate and try to use other characters as forfiet fodder.  Bacta Tank is the key.<br>
<br>
HD:  If racing, you might be able to beat them in the race, cutting them down.  If not, beat them up when they get guys out.  Use the OOC/ TTs.  Try to kill Vader.  <br>
<br>
SYCFA:  Most versions of this deck in my region are flipping.  Just kill their gunners, and finish them off in battles once they flip.  If they drain, use your Plea to the Court.  Shouldn’t be too hard.<br>
<br>
YMSYL:  I’ve been able to beat this deck before.  You just get set up, flip, and then possibly invade Hoth.  Only put your characters at the inner marker sites so you won’t get caught by an Ice Storm.  Most decks will play with interior sites for you to hide at when the weather gets bad.  Try to win to the best of your ability.  There’s not much room for mistakes.<br>
<br>
Ralops:  I should probobly include an Ounee Ta for this matchup.  Should I drop Revo?  Anywho, try to kick them around on Raltiir.  I probobly swich the cards.  It would make this a much easier matchup.<br>
<br>
TDIGWATT:  Try not to let them flip.  Control one site with a vengeance.  If they put out another CC site, all the better.  You can use it to cancel Dark Deal.  No flip, no drain boost, no win.<br>
<br>
CCT:  Easy.  Just kill their escort group (or clear the chamber once they get there).<br>
<br>
MKOS:  Qui-guy helps with this.  Kill off any mains they have.  Use Ben and the Tank to keep your guys alive.<br>
<br>
Well, that’s about it.  If you have any comments, concerns, suggestions, or opinions, just let me know.  If you want me to put stuff in, tell me what to take out.  Thanx!<br>
