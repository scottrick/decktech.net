I beat the match up many times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first thing I want to say is....This deck is built with only 3 boxes of Coruscant, and 2 boxes of Tatooine.  I did not buy any extra other than that...I did make a trade or two, but that is about it.  So do not tell me to add the new twilek..(what it is called) because I do not own one yet, and I only own one Keder, and anything else like two Wattos...well I only have one...so there.<br>
<br>
Regardless of those Cards I do not have, this deck rocks...well for the EP1 format anyway.  Lott Dott, makes up for all the cards I do not own, because I can get whatever I want with him.  Why play three?  Because he rocks...and he is the best for the effect &#148;This is Outrageous&#148; Because of the Trade thing.  Watto Junkyard is so tempting for the light side to hang out at, and I beat them up there so many times...with Watto...they never learn...<br>
<br>
Anyway I will not go into to much detail, but if you want to try this deck out...just build it, and you will see it is a monster.  Here is just a couple of card reasons.<br>
<br>
No Sense...I had Sense in at first and then thought...Oh my god the lightside doesn&#8217;t have any interrupt I care about so what a wasted card.  However the lightside could sense so many things, that I do not want them to touch...so that is why I play with just Altar and Control.... Now you might be thinking I have no way to protect my Political Effects...wrong again...It happens so many times...They Alter my P Effect...I deploy Probe droid get in back on table in no time at all.<br>
<br>
I really can care less about capturing the Queen, but it fits in really nice with everything else I am doing here.  Yes this will out drain a Space lightside...which by the way...space is the only place LS can go in this format(and have a chance to win).<br>
<br>
That is it...Enjoy, and once again trust me...this deck rocks...build and practice if you need it. Have fun,<br>
