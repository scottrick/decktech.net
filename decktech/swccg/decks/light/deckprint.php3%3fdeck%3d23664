As my Description implies I need help with my card choices so if any of you care to add your 2 cents of constructive criticism I&#146;d love to hear it.  On to how to play it...<br>
<br>
First, after you draw your hand, use Mob Points to pull Executor.  Then pull Search and Destory and activate your force.  Most likely you will have at least one character you can deploy to Mos Espa and then get Watto down to his site (either by your hand or reserve deck).  After flipping, pull watto&#146;s cube and a card with crush.  Make the opponent loose 2 force from the card from crush then get down search and destory to make them loose another 1. Draw until you have at least one card that can save watto.. i.e. Imperial Barrier, Projective Telepathy, Force Field, or a Ghhk.  Use Any We Must Accelerate Our Plans to get down the Bridge.  Once you have it down use them to pull some of your effects.  Set up at Tatooine with Executor and Thrawn or Zuckuss and get occupation going.  Drain on ground and try to tag the opponent with Maul and Vader suicide missions using First Strike, I have you now, and maul strikes.  The direct damage of the deck should kill off the opponent with ease or at least make it where your battle damage can kill them off.<br>
<br>
Alright here is a brief list of cards I have been thinking of adding.. if any of you can suggest which i should add (and what to drop for it) or what i shouldn&#146;t worry about I would appreciate it.<br>
