There are five of them.  Oh well, a revised version will go up based on review comments, anyway.<br>
<br>
  Most of the cards in here should be familiar now that Decktech has been choked up with Watch Your Step decks.  So I&#8217;ll stick to the ones which might have readers scratching their heads.<br>
<br>
  Rogue 1 and 3 are unpiloted, so they deploy at normal cost, and are great places to stuff characters with low defense value in battle.  Get extra flips from inside, safe from lightsabers and most other weapons.  Echo Base Garrison gives them immunity to attrition <4, <6 when Luke or Wedge is piloting his own speeder.  It also gets your maintenance droids, the &#8217;Bantha&#8217; Droid, a Lateral Damage canceler, and Leebo.<br>
<br>
  Cantina Brawl is a fun and powerful card to use against any mains who take over the Cantina.	Each player draws a destiny, if either matches the ability of any characters in the Cantina, they&#8217;re lost.  You don&#8217;t need to track it to make it useful, especially if you play it twice back to back, once from hand and once from the Lost Pile.  But it helps if you think your opponent has a 6 set up, or if you&#8217;ve tracked a 6.  Play the Brawl, start a fight in the Cantina, and take out Vader.  Then beat Tarkin senseless.<br>
<br>
  Rycar Ryjerd trains a character as a smuggler or adds 1 to the power of a smuggler.  This is used as a set up for Smuggler&#8217;s Blues, which allows a smuggler trained by Rycar to retrieve force from Kessel Run straight to your hand.  That&#8217;s like the Drazin/Special Delivery trick, you&#8217;re reloading on characters, ships, and other cards, including Kessel Runs if they haven&#8217;t been placed out of play.<br>
<br>
  Beggar locks down an opponent&#8217;s force for a Draw Their Fire beatdown, uses up a saved force to stop an Imperial Barrier, or takes enough force from your opponent to pay for your retrieval when Secret Plans is out and you&#8217;re low on life force.  Rug Hug is a great card, a Luke/Chewie battle destiny adder which can also add 4 wherever you have a Rebel and alien in battle together.  Very flexible.<br>
<br>
  Insertion Planning is a good 6 destiny Used Interrupt to take 3 off the opponent&#8217;s destiny where you have a scout on the ground.  Between Jedi Luke and all the Ralltir Freighter Captains, you&#8217;ll have a scout to use it with.<br>
<br>
  There you have it, barroom brawls, beatdowns, and mass retrieval.  Enough said.<br>
