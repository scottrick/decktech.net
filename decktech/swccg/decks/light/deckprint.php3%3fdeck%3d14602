<br>
This deck has yet to be played in a tournament but i was wonderin what others thought and i welcome ne critizm<br>
<br>
as soon as you draw the signal use it to get ANSB and incom.  then use strike to get riekan and madine.  madine allows u to get the 3 scouts which is plenty of characters in order to do ebo.<br>
Y riekan makes it so ebo cant go awya.  y beezer, and junkin.  beezer stops reacts and allows for a reason to look through your deck.  Junkin just because he is a 3 2 character.  When u draw org attack if u r short on x&#146;s just use it to go get 3 of em.  everything else seems self explanatory.<br>
<br>
match ups:<br>
<br>
BHBM-<br>
luke at 4th marker but dont deploy him until vader is out else where.  drains ought to hurt and u should be able to win in space if not u r doin something wrong.  Drains ought to kill<br>
<br>
court<br>
get crix and get him on tat. then use him to get chewie.  and deploy maybe one other person.  up to u.<br>
<br>
Endor ops no flip-<br>
good game swarm and kill. your drains should be about equal so it will depend on battles but x- wings are very good power so.<br>
<br>
Endor Ops flip-<br>
dont go to endor. prolly not enough space to hold more than endor but that can still be a 7 drain so u might want to do your best to take control of endor early.<br>
<br>
HD-<br>
dont deploy obi or luke ne wheres near vader.  your dstinys are not good so u will probably lose. drains will be the deciding factor most likely in this game<br>
<br>
ISB-<br>
mostlikely a drain race.  dont go to ground newhere but hoth.  if doing ORS in space it could be a good game.<br>
<br>
Dark Deal Objective-<br>
drain race it could be bad.  Prolly most difficult match up.  They will definetly have some space but swarm x-wings work well at cloud city.  take cloud city over quickly and they r skrewed<br>
<br>
CCT-<br>
it shouldnt be to bad.  No 1 really plays that where i am so there is not much advice i can give.<br>
<br>
<br>
UPDATE!!!<br>
take out x assualts and add s-foils and another cannon </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
