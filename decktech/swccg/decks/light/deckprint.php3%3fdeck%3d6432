opps i did it again, i called Draw their fire first strike, my apologies.]<br>

Ok this deck's weaknesses are now gone.  The two weaknesses of this deck were:<br>
Hunt down with early vader at the cantina and Endor opps big blue space.  The reason they're not weaknesses anymore is because...I added in Boushh to block that annoying interior site drain of 2(that's the only site that drains for 2 indoors once I've tested.) added in another TT.  Added in CHS and Falcon, lando and chewie on board will be able to hit and run in space.	just blocking the opponent's drains long enough for me to out drain him on land.  i hope She's alright has been added as well to destroy space decks(this card absolutely kills SFS)<br>
As I've said before, if the opponent goes outdoors he loses.  If the opponent plays it safe and stays indoors or in space, i will out drain him.  The only game tjis deck ever lost(it's still a new deck so it hasn't played much) was to a Huntdown deck that got vader tothe cantina first turn, drained at the holotable and ran 5 visages.  Plus he knew my deck and he knew not to go outdoors, and I still only lost that game by 10.<br>
Oh, by the way I also added numbers protection in the form of ultamatum, because i can track where my battlegrounds are pretty easy with site from RD deployment and occupy 3 BGs easy. numbers aren't a problem.<br>
On to your comments:<br>
Farmboy luke because he deploys for 3 and gives extra activation.  also because sometimes you can get him AND yoda out 1st turn.<br>
Someone said I'd lose a Drain race with court deck that stays in the chamber...That wouldn't happen, he'd drain for 2 at the chamber(if he had POTF) and I'd be draining for at least 2 and 2 because i'd have at least 2 sites out.  Boushh will also help me now.<br>
Ties would not be a problem because they'd have so many more cards on table than me, super falcon to slow their drains and i hope she's alright.<br>
Test 2 is would be cool but it's not worth it, i don't really care if they can draw BD when Out power them by 30 or so.<br>
OK, and the guy who said HD would kill me because  I'd lose Luke?  Then they could alter the flaps?  Ummm no...Luke goes to dagobah.  And you said I'd be losing 6 forse per turn but you only list a drain of 1?  Visage will be long gone.	I'll out drain a HD easily. 'Wraith' you need to understand the deck before you revirew, and don't lie in your reviews saying a drain of 6 will happen when thats impossible.<br>
