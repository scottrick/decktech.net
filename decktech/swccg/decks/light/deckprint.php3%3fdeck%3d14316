In response to Bigzz&#146;s review...actually on EPP Leia&#146;s game text, it says @Leia&#146;s Blaster Rifle, which in turn makes it unique...right?!<br>
*****************<br>
<br>
This whole profit deal is great when you have many mains. <br>
I do have a lot of mains, more than anyone that I know, however I don’t know how to play them as well as I could.  I really do need some suggestions with card playing/combos that would work well in this sorta deck.<br>
<br>
Card Explanations...<br>
<br>
Obviously the character selection is pretty good, even I can see that.  However, I would trade Obi-Wan Kenobi for another Ben Kenobi.  And I do like spy’s...and I know that some of you might think, Bothan Spy?  I know, I know, but I don’t know what to replace it with.  Is Momaw Nadon worth being in there?  The Artoo/Gift combo kicks royal butt and hasn’t been stopped yet. (Yes, I know it can be Snipped and Lt. Pol Tridium can stop it, but it still hasn’t happened)  Also, I have two EPP Leia’s in there because I have found that it is hard to release Han without 3 Leias...<br>
<br>
Effects and Locations are self-explanitory I think, but the Leia’s Blasting Rifle is a question, I know.  With two EPP Leia’s in there, why did I put that in?  I dunno honestly, I would like to replace it with a saber if I could...<br>
<br>
And, I also think that all of the interrupts are good, are they?<br>
<br>
VS Various Decks...<br>
<br>
Hunt Down...<br>
You can either use Undercover Spys or Transmission Terminated to cancel Visage.  Usually a close battle, but let them come to you...keep your focus on releasing Han.<br>
<br>
Space...<br>
It’s a drain war, with no space in this deck, you have to drain better on the ground, which means flipping ASAP...if you can’t or just plain get-stuck...game over!<br>
<br>
Court...<br>
This is a fun game to play, I have usually come out on top because of nice interrupts in here, like Swing and a Miss, and destiny adders.  But the key in any game is to stick to your game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Any suggestions or card replacements are welcomed, thank you!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
