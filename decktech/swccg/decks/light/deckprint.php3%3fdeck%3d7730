<br>
Against Hunt Down -Let Visage eat you both by putting Luke on a Lift Tube or cancel it with one of 4 spies.  Save Draw Their Fire and then battle w/ Ben or a big enough force to take out Vader.  This deck flips so fast that Hunt Down (with the low amount of different characters) doesn't stand a chance.  This is the only place that SAC won't help you much.  Battle against Mara w/ a Bothan then play double agent so she'll be placed out of play.  Retrieve w/ Death Star Plans.<br>
<br>
CPI -Kill those dang dirty Death Star Gunners over and over again with Epp's and spies.  Grab All Sections on Alert or Sense it.  Control the death star sites and drain on Yavin or any sites he provides you with.  Load Luke and Han onto a ship and send them up to take out some Destroyers.  Priority one is controlling the death star and killing the gunners then worry about flipping.<br>
<br>
Ops -You don't see Dark Ops very often anymore.  Get Battle Plan quick and rescue Leia.  Use the tank to minimize any battle damage and drain with Prisoner Leia.  SAC will hurt him immensly.  Death Star Plans to beat him in the long run.<br>
<br>
ROPS -With Obi Wan Kenobi, 3 Senses, Romas Lock Navander, 2 Under Attack, and a Mechanical Failure...no vehicles will be giving you any sort of trouble.  KIll the character with the EPP weapons and flip back his objective with Tantive or FLy Casual +another ship.  He won't be able to spread out as well because of the inablility to react.<br>
<br>
Court -This deck eats Court alive.  This deck's destiny is so high that I can target most any character at any time and be confident I'll hit them.  KIll kill kill.	Easy win.  Mop up w/ Death Star Plans.	SAC's a killer.<br>
<br>
ISB -2 Double Agents and lots o' vehicle killers.  Retrieve w/ Plans and battle him out of characters.  SAC for anything anything important.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading this.  Try it out.  It's a very strong deck.<br>
