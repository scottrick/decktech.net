The idea is to achieve maximum activation through the use of gas miners.  The mission in the early game therefore is to control Bespin:CC and to pull out all those clouds.  You can't use the activation skill of the gas miner until you control the CC sector.  With the release of ECC<br>
there is now a predominant use of starfighters in the DS.  With that I came to the conclusion that<br>
the X-Wing cannon would be most effective.  Whatch ot for the bus though.  Just about every effect is key.  That is why we almost always start<br>
Wise Advice.  It's also why there are 4 Signals.<br>
The only Effect that needs to be out ASAP is Beldons Eye.  That is,if you want to double your activation.<br>
<br>
The combos that make this deck:(or,What do I do w/ all that force?)<br>
<br>
On the Edge x2+Flash of insight+Descent into Dark<br>
+A Few Maneuvers or OOComission+(obviously a Rebel of ability&gt;2):This combo essentially lets you retrieve your whole deck.  Warning:This is to be done as late game as possible(like your last 5-10 force).	(Scenario)You play the used 6 (or 5),<br>
recycle it,play on the edge,(call 5,recycle the 1 force),draw 6, retrieve 5 cards,activate till the 6 is on top(if there are more cards under the 6 draw it&lt;Flash of Insight&gt;and activate what left of the reserve deck,play the 6 again,recycle it,<br>
play On the Edge(again),call 5 ,draw 6,retrieve 5,<br>
recycle,activate till the used 6 or On the Edge is on top then draw it w/Flash of Insight(you need them both),activate the rest of deck and repeat. So whats wrong w/ this?  Too card intensive,not really because once you activate your deck you can search for the appropriate cards w/ hiding in the garbage. Besides,this is meant for late game therefore you have time to accumulate the right cards.  Secret Plans only means that you need that much more miners.<br>
<br>
Out of Comission+Descent into Dark+ Hiding<br>
in the garbage: Activate your whole deck,play OOC,<br>
recycle it,activate OOC ,call interrupt,draw it,<br>
Play it, repeat until lost pile empty.	One way to use this effectively is to watch for a Vader to Go to the lost pile,OOC the lost pile to death<br>
=no more playing Vader, no more flipped Hunt Down.<br>
  But what about grabbers?  They sould already of<br>
been used or lost by the time these combos are used.(I was gonna try to use radar scanners and those devices that go on vehicles&lt;cloud car&gt; to enhance radar scanner e.g.move an additional Effect&lt;grabber&gt; or interrupt to used pile but I decided not.<br>
<br>
Besides the above the deck is fully capable of making a maelstrom type beatdown and draining largely on CC.<br>
<br>
vs.Hunt Down:see Out of Comission strategy. Watch as Visage hurts them more than you.<br>
<br>
vs.Ops(any):Get Battle plan out Quick or start w/it if you don't fear SAC. The big beatdown should end this. Romas'lock'Navander is a god.<br>
<br>
vs.any DS CC:tough game? Not Really,just hide in the 1/0 site,run away in early game and control CC.<br>
<br>
vs.TIE's(sienar):Out of Comission Hahahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
vs.Big Blue:Drain Drain Drain!!<br>
<br>
vs. anything else:Not much else I can think of that would be a problem.<br>
<br>
In conclusion,this deck takes some practice to play(alot!)but for the time being will be suprising.I welcome any comments and Ideas and will continue to modify this deck.<br>
