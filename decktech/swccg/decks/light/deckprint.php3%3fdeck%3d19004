So if it looks different, that is why.  Also, I really need some help with this deck.  My brother recently decided to only play me in Star Wars only once or twice a week and that is not good enough to make a tournament worthy deck.<br>
<br>
The idea for this was inspired by Brian Hunter&#146;s Hidden Mains.  A deck with high activation from an objective he did not flip.  I looked at it and thought, why not use dagobah sites because my opponent can&#146;t drain there (it&#146;s pretty hard to get on Dagobah)and it gives me pretty good activation and my opponent low activation.  The first design had docking bays, but that did not really conform to my playing style so I took them out.  Thus, up above is my way of playing MWYHL mains.<br>
<br>
This deck was created for defence against MKOS mains, senate, Hunt Down, and Podracing.  With MKOS, many players would use lightsabers on Maul, Mara, etc. to help enhance drains. The senate has a political effect to enhance a drain.  I felt the first jedi test was much more secure than Menace Fades.  I also noticed alot of SAC started coming up agian.  Many players just stick in the combo effect as defence.  The combo merely punishes the opponent for playing SAC but it does not prevent him.  MWYHL adds 4 to the destiny.  This makes it much harder for the opponent to play SAC.  I also noticed that it is becoming harder for the light side to accomplish an objective.  The dark side now has Maul in addition to Vader, Mara, and Emporer.  So I decided to make this a reactive deck. Against podracing there are two Too Close For Comfort.  This prevents my opponent from messing with my race total.  Often my opponent won&#146;t play Hit Racer or Podracer until I would win the podrace during move phase.  (Somehow I seem to win the podrace almost every time but my opponent used to play the interrupt that removes a race destiny before move phase) This card prevents my opponent from &quot;changing the outcome&quot; of the race.  It is also great during battles because most of the time players will not save 2 force for a weapon.<br>
<br>
Tantive IV? Who plays with that? I play with it because I want to be able to go anywhere.  Tantive IV lets me go anywhere in space and Corran Horn, Lando w/ax, and Jar Jar can go anywhere on the ground.  <br>
<br>
Why test all the way to 3? I chose to test to #3 because of the ability to subtract one from all my opponent&#146;s destiny draws.  I feel this is huge.  Why not go to 4, 5, then 6?  Well, I tried doing the mains out early while doing that but it did not really work out.  If I want to go to test 4 or above, I need to do the training turtle kind of deck where I hide in my shell till I am done training.  I believe test 4 is great with the ability to pull any card but I prefer to just go to test 3.<br>
<br>
In mid and late game this deck is a beast.  Minus one from all opponents destinies (battle, weapon, etc.), minus 2 from attrition, tracking, weapon levi, changing the odds, etc.<br>
<br>
The mains are self explanatory, the Cantina is for a good drain during late game, Throw Me Another Charge is For Tracking, 2 On the Edge is for retrieval, I could go on forever...<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
There really is no difference in playing style.  Just play smart and let them make the first move.  Battle them away.  Maybe you will even be able to use Watto&#146;s Box to your advantage.<br>
<br>
Tournament history:<br>
This deck is not quite the same as the one I used in a previous tourny but..it had only been played in one tourny.  It went 2-1, only losing to a senate which I should have beat.  I only lost by ten which is good considering I lost the podrace when Watto&#146;s box was out.  I should have won because I had a race total of 30 to his 28 but he played the interrupt to remove a race destiny and I was not playing Too Close for Comfort.  After I lost the race he played Limited Resource and I lost 4 more.  If I had a Too Close for Comfort I would have had not lost 15, retrieved eleven, and my opponent would lose eleven.  I probably would have won the game easily. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
