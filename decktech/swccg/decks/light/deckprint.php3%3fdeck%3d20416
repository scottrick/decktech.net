At first I must say: That is my favorit deck and i think the best (after CMQ) deck for <br>
The Light side. <br>
&amp;#61664; Now to the Strategy:<br>
 At first i look for Crix and Solo with Strike Planning.<br>
In my first turn I look for the Home one db and deploy crix there (Look for any scout(I prefer Chwei)<br>
And taske him into Hand). Than move Luke to the Endor db. Now you give the opponent a force <br>
Drain of two. That makes the opponet to come to Endor , where you can kill him with Solo, Chwie <br>
And some other scouts. Use the Interrupts: Take the initiative(your destiny +1 for each scout) and <br>
Insertion Planning (opponents destiny -3).  With this style you get a lot of stack cards to cross Vader <br>
To the light side. When the opponent lets you drain on Endor. Deploy Midge to Chipa&amp;#8217;s Hut (he makes<br>
Force drain +1 everywhere, where you have a scout with ability &gt;2). Now you give the opponent a drain <br>
Of 3 by Luke. Deploy Back Door With Daughter or Orrimaarko  and some scouts. Now the opponent gets <br>
a drain of 6 every turn and when the opponent comes to battle you use Follen Portal to kill him.<br>
This deck has a lot of high destinys so use them. With Drop and the  Missiles(destiny 7) with On the Edge, <br>
to retrive A lot of Force. That is my Basic tactic. Here are some tactics against some decks I often play again:<br>
<br>
&amp;#61664;Court: Like the Basic, but don&amp;#8217;t deploy to Tatooine. Drain on Endor and let him come.<br>
<br>
&amp;#61664;Hunt down: Against Huntdown you have very good chances, because when the opponent <br>
                          comes with Vader to look to duel him, Luke is captured and the opponent can&amp;#8217;t <br>
                          duel him, so you can collect three Stack cards and cross Luke to the light side. <br>
<br>
&amp;#61664;Sienar: Agains that deck i is very difficult to play, and I often lose against this deck, because<br>
                  I don&amp;#8217;t play much Starships (only two, because i don&amp;#8217;t now what i can do out of my <br>
                  deck to play more ships??).<br>
<br>
&amp;#61664;Watto: Give drains with Luke and with the rest of the scouts try to kick Watto out of the game. <br>
                 I think Watto decks are one of the best dark decks(after Court).   <br>
<br>
So these are the 4 decks, i often play again. So that&amp;#8217;s all, thanks for read/rating my deck. And have fun <br>
By playing Star Wars CCG. <br>
