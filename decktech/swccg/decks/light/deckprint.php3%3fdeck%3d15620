 This was my Deck it plays in 3 games (5-0)<br>
 2 Full Win, 1 Modiefied Win.<br>
 In the Modified Win I make bad mistakes it was<br>
 easy to win full but i to the false thing.<br>
 The Dark Deck makes my 5th place MKOS only win<br>
 one of 3 games! I played with Dark Deck 3 Times<br>
 against WYS and there are only 4 WYS at the Tourney!<br>
 <br>
 This TIGH plays against two MKOS and 1 Court Deck.<br>
 <br>
 The first thing is I played Rebel Scout Luke, he<br>
 can cancel the Immunity of combat vehicles and<br>
 relocate to Throne Room (against BHBM)<br>
 <br>
 In the 1st Turn I get out General Solo and <br>
 General Crix Madine, get Crix to the Home One:DB<br>
 and Luke to the Endor Docking Bay. Take Chewie<br>
 in. Next Time get Wuta out Deploy a scout to Madine<br>
 (I dont want him alone). Most of My Characters<br>
 are here for battle, use the Scouts to beat down<br>
 your opponnents Characters. And Drain with<br>
 Luke Leia and Midge at Endor. General Solo with<br>
 Rebel Leadership is very Powerful. <br>
 I fight against a Scum Deck, with 6 Scouts <br>
 and add a Destiny with Rebel Leadership, he <br>
 cancel one with Boelo a 2, second was a 6, with<br>
 Take the Initative Battle Destiny 12!! 12 attrition<br>
 it was Bad for Scum. One Destiny cancel and with <br>
 Insert Planning Oppponenst remainig Destiny was 0!<br>
 <br>
 This was a battle that hurt much!<br>
 Corran is good for this Deck works great against<br>
 bounty hunters and he is spy and can use with Take the <br>
 Initative!(Powerful Card)<br>
 <br>
 I get Under Attack and Concussion Missle for<br>
 Sail Barge and other combat vehicles. <br>
 <br>
 This Deck works very good!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
