Two Ways. 1. Order to Engage. Put down Rennek + Bo Shuda, and then OTE. Make them lose 3 force a turn until they move out of the AC. If you think they will cancel it, Signal for Uh-Oh! 2. Beatdown. 3 Lukes's + 3 Obi's = One of them at least in opening hand. Whoop up at the Audience Chamber. Scum and Villainy dies horribly because if they move out, they lose Scum. Artoo's gift also does it's work. Once you want to free Han, he stays at the AC protected by Bo Shuda, and you retrieve 10 force. I was thinking about adding It's A Trap to cancel Sniper, but I'm not sure. Then you just occupy Tatooine and drain them out. BTW, normal start is Don't Tread on Me for DODN and ST. Don't deviate from the start unless you know that one effect kills them. In that case, signal for it. Meta:<br>
<br>
HuntDown: 1 Spy + 2 TT's to cancel Visage. I don't see dueling around here, so I don't have the interrupts for it. It's a meta decision. If your area has dueling, put them in. Otherwise, stick to your game plan. You can kick them off Tatooine easily, and occupy them out.<br>
<br>
Ops: Don't see this much, but Artoo does his work here. The big retrieval removes speed factor while you set up, and then it's battling or draining.<br>
<br>
Big Blue: Mechanical Failure, the high destinies, and the destiny adders are huge here. Hit them where they are weak and occupy and drain on Tatooine.<br>
<br>
Scum: Ha! Best possible matchup. Control the AC easily to cancel Scum. Artoo kills drains and destiny, weapons and destiny adders clear sites.<br>
<br>
Can't think of anything else. As always, if you have a question, e-mail me BEFORE reviewing.
