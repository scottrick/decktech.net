That&#8217;s how it is, lads. Alien Profit now simply is more consistent than Speed Profit in my opinion. Speed Profit will often lose to BHBM, Hunt Down, and a few other popular decks out there. This route is better. This deck combines a lot of strategies, dealing out direct damage, beatdown potential, and a little retrieval. It pulls all of its locations and key characters from Reserve, and has high destiny to boot.<br>
<br>
Tunnel Vision is key to this deck. When combined with Insurrection, it allows you to fish out exactly what you need, be it a Jedi Luke, someone&#8217;s Stick, a Barrier, or whatever. It allows me play with only a few mains and still be able to get them on the table quickly.<br>
<br>
The 10-card retrievel (from the Obj.) gives you about three to five turns to set up and ignore what the opponent is doing. Let him drain while you eat Visage or Your Destiny and carry out your gameplan.<br>
<br>
I have been toying with Elom decks since before the release of DSII, and I believe that Profit is the best platform. Three Signals to get out Wise Advice quickly against a SAC deck, and Staging Areas against anything else. Also a trackable five.<br>
<br>
<b><U>CARD EXPLANATIONS:</b></U><br>
<i>Why Ketwol?</i><br>
Because he makes DB transit free. Useful for invading DSII against BHBM.<br>
<br>
<i>Why the CC DB?</i><br>
Another location for Profit damage, ECC Lando adds a destiny there.<br>
<br>
<i>Why Rennek?</i><br>
Stops Bubo from munching Tessek and Tanus.<br>
<br>
<b><U>CARDS TO CONSIDER:</b></U><br>
<i>It&#8217;s A Trap</i> - Anti-Sniper.  <br>
<br>
<i>Figrin Dan</i> - Nice with high destiny and the ability to keep him alive.<br>
<br>
<i>Blast The Door, Kid!</i> - Tech card to enhance beatdown at docking bays. Can also be used defensively. <br>
<br>
<i>Scramble</i> - Another card that can make the Eloms more potent. <br>
<br>
<i>Aim High</i> - Good defense against TIEs and Scum. <br>
<br>
<i>I Hope She&#8217;s All Right</i> - The best anti-TIE card in the game. With no ships, it&#8217;s definitely a card to give thought to. <br>
<br>
<b><U>MATCHUPS:</b></u><br>
<b>Vs. BHBM:</b> This game is usually pretty easy. Give them Luke immediately and let them start eating the force loss while you continue to win the duels with the high destinies. The remaining mains, Eloms, and Fallen Portals will give you the edge on the ground while the direct damage eats them.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Hunt Down:</b> Similar to BHBM, just cancel Visage with the Bothan Spy and invade the Executor with about four or five Eloms. Look to drop a beatdown, otherwise, chase them with mains, and spread and drain with Eloms.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Scum (Court or ISB):</b> This is the big question. This can beat Court consistently, just be careful with the mains and avoid getting them captured (Barriers, picking battles). ISB ORS is really difficult, because they can quickly convert your starting sites. Keep them at bay with mains and try to outdrain with the Eloms.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. TIEs:</b> Bargaining Table should give you the win. Direct damage and big drains should outmatch their drains. Add Aim High though if TIEs are meta for you. Or just add my personal favorite anti-TIE card - I Hope She&#8217;s All Right.<br>
<br>
<i>Any questions? D-mail me.</i><br>
<br>
<b><u>Track Record:</b></u><br>
I never used this deck in tournament play due to a lack of tournaments that lasted until the release of JPSD. With the release of the MKOS objective and the popularity explosion of Scum decks, this deck took a back seat to Hidden Mains. However, in playtesting, it was a very consistent deck that could handle the ever-popular BHBM and ROps decks very well.<br>
