I played it several times and mostly it was successful.<br>
Sure it has a few problems with some kind of Darkside Decks ( e.g. if a lot of those @#$%ing bounty hunters with guns are battling my low-ability scouts ) but if you play smart you could handle it.<br>
<br>
Start the game with:<br>
<br>
	RST / GD<br>
	Endor<br>
	Endor: Rebel Landing Site ( Forest )<br>
	Heading For The Medical Frigate<br>
	Strike Planning<br>
	Squadron Assignments<br>
	Insurrection<br>
<br>
Before you activate in the first turn - pull two generals from your Reserve Deck.<br>
One of these two must be General Crix Mardine the second one depends on your starting hand.<br>
Mostly I pull General Calrissian because there are 2 General Solo큦 in the Deck so you will soon<br>
draw one.<br>
In your deploy phase you search for the Home One: Docking Bay and you use the squadron <br>
assignments  to play General Calrissian and the Gold Squadron 1 to Endor.<br>
If your opponent gives you one or more force icons you play also General Crix Mardine to the<br>
Home One: Docking Bay or to the Gold Squadron 1 ( who you think it will be better for this important guy ).<br>
You can now use its game text to pull a scout from Reserve Deck.<br>
From now it depends on what you want to do first: Go to the ground or to strengthen your situation<br>
on Endor.<br>
<br>
Later in the game when you have flipped the Objective you should concentrate to blow away the<br>
bunker.<br>
At this time the cards you need ( Explosive Charges, Throw Me Another Charge and Sergeant Junkin ) should be in your hand and so you can easily destroy the Bunker. <br>
<br>
Try to get out I큞l Take The Leader and Close Air Support quickly in the game!!!<br>
<br>
With Battle Plan and Menace Fades you will slow down every fast ground or space drain deck.<br>
<br>
Kessel will be a nice drain if your opponent is weak in space - but more important is to control<br>
( or at least occupy ) Endor ( Close Air Support ).<br>
<br>
With Mantellian Savrip and Houjix you will have in most cases no problems with the battle damage.<br>
<br>
And with the Ithorians you can raise your Force Drains on Endor.<br>
<br>
Remember the new card  &amp;#8222;The Shield Is Down&amp;#8220; ( Force generation +1 on each Endor site / Deploy Back Door from Reserve Deck and you receive 8 force when bunker is blown away ( opponent must place their hand in the Used Pile )) from the coming expansion it will extremely boost this deck.<br>
<br>
No special matchups - you must alway have a closer look what your opponent is going to do but in almost every match you will play the same strategy.<br>
<br>
That큦 all<br>
Thanks for reading and rating <br>
