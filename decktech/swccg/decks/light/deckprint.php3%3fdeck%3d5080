<br>
<br>
it seems i made a mistake and forgot to correct the deckmaker file.  the cloud city carbonite chamber should be the lower corridor<br>
<br>
<br>
ok some card choices...<br>
<br>
no odds defense...who's playing dark odds these days?	that's right.	nobody.<br>
<br>
no duel defense...the deck is tight.  the was i see it...if dark is dueling and they really want to win the duel they will beat me regardless of my protection unless i wanna run 4 anti-duel cards and that's not happening<br>
<br>
tunnel visions...this card is great...im activating a lot of force...i have cards that work well together...i'll get them during control phase instead of drawing.<br>
<br>
skywalkers...3 leias and 3 lukes...why not...and its good for barriers.  picked it over dont get @#$%y and gift because han and luke already get destinies and obi and luke usually dont see each other.<br>
<br>
<br>
now how to win<br>
<br>
<br>
operatives- signal for battle order instead of careful planning for generics.  if you dont you lose.  boussh will help you drain on their planet.  battle them away and use order to engage and bacta tank as well as savrip.<br>
<br>
isb- use draw their fire and order to engage to your advantage.  force advantage will give you the game.  just battle them to death.<br>
<br>
court- get obi to the ac earlier.  use other characters to battle them to death and use civil disorder to take advantage of their lack of force.<br>
<br>
hdadtj- cancel visage asap.  try to out of commission vader.  force advantage is key.  overwhelm them with battles<br>
<br>
rops- if you see rops chalk up another win.  force advantage is huge.  obi on their planet early gives you the game.  save up characters to flip them back and use your ships to beat them out of space.<br>
