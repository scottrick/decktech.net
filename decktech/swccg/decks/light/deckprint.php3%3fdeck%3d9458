  Put In (4) : CrackShot, Slayn Korpil Facilities,<br>
	       proton Torpedoes,Blue Squadron Bwing<br>
<br>
  Take out(4): L. blount, Tala 2, C. Cracken, Tala 1<br>
<br>
Due To popular Demand I put JT#6 Back in!1<br>
Put in Proton torpedos too...<br>
<br>
Crackshot is EXCELLANT Addition to this deck because you'll hit everything you encounter in space, And Then they'll lose more...<br>
<br>
Blue Squadron B-wings are better for this deeck because of their Bonus when Firing Weapons. So I took out Tala 1 & 2 and their Pilots.<br>
<br>
Slayn Korpil Facilities - Just an extra card Since I have Roche anyway, Could be good for retrieval earlyin thegame.<br>
<br>
Technique/Strategy<br>
------------------<br>
Against Bring Him Before Me or Hunt Down and Destroy The Jedi on Turn 1<br>
 send Yor Insight Serves you well to the lost pile to retrieve<br>
 Honor Of The Jedi<br>
<br>
<br>
For Jedi Test #5 Try To Track a 7....Against BHBM your should try to track<br>
 R2 in Red 5 so that when You defeat Vader in a BHBM duel, Luke will not<br>
 cross to the DS.<br>
<br>
At Peace is in here For Protection Against Broken Concentration.<br>
<br>
Once The Training Grounds is out, Search for a Jedi Test During EVERY TURN,<br>
  This includes Your Opponents! Kepp all Jedi tests in Hand at All Times.<br>
<br>
Intruder Missles arent just here for Destiny Tracking, They can deploy on<br>
  EVERY Starfighter in the deck except R2 in Red 5 and Red Squadron 1.<br>
<br>
Super Falcon = 5 destinies after completing Jedi Test #6<br>
  Han, Lando, Liea, Nien Nunb<br>
<br>
Sense Alter Protection	- I know it will be hard at first with the +4 and<br>
the high Destiny Deck, But After you flip, which doesn't take long, You<br>
should be able to keep your opponent from playing any devstating effects,<br>
or intterupts.<br>
<br>
Retrieval, against Something Special Planned for them, Being able to retriev 18 cards should be good enough...Having that card placed out of play shouldnthurt you too bad.<br>
<br>
ROCHE - Its a Battle Ground system where your opponent cant drain you, but youcan drain him.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
