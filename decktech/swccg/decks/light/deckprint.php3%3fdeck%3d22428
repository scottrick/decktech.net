<br>
I mean this is a solid deck, right? Well I think so, and if you read this version, maybe you will be convinced. (Probably not, but it will get you 3 tech points at the very least.)<br>
<br>
Another reason that I am playing this deck, is because in my area, Senate TIEs has been running rampant. And I figured that Hidden Base flip would be a good way to shred these decks. <br>
<br>
But before I start the strategy section for this deck, I figure that I had better tell you why I picked some of the cards that I did. <br>
<br>
Locations<br>
	The only real surprises here are Clak&#8217;Dor VII and Raithal. I play both of these systems, because two of the pilots that I play add to force drains at these sites. That is all that goes behind that. (Plus I have always wanted to use these systems. I mean when was the last time you used Clak&#8217;Dor VII in a deck?) <br>
	Also, the Coruscant: Docking Bay (Episode 1) may make you ask some questions also, but there is a reason why. Just check the characters segment of the strategy to see why.<br>
<br>
Starships<br>
	Well I use Red 8 and Red 9 from Special Edition because not only do their pilots add to force drains at a couple of my systems, but the ships add to total weapon destiny of X-Wing Cannons, which is what this deck is all about. This is also the reason that I use Hobbie and his ship, Red Squadron 4. Cheap and can use X-Wing Cannons very easily. Also, I use the new Virtual Gold 1 card because it is awesome. With Dutch aboard, this ship is a power 6 and a maneuver of 4 that can also add a pilot, such as Corran Horn or Melas. Plus the taking of a card into hand during the control phase is just icing on the cake. All of this for 3 force. The very model of efficiency. <br>
<br>
Characters<br>
	The key to this deck is the new Virtual Luke Skywalker. With the ability to pull out a Darklighter Spin during your control phase makes this deck fly. By pulling the All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin combo, you can get all of your ships out fast. Plus the late game retrieval that the new Luke is capable of is awsome. This deck is super fast. <br>
	Well Bren Quersey and Lietuenant Naytaan are the pilots for Red 8 and Red 9 respectively. These guys go to their ships for two, and their ships go down to certain systems for free. That means that these X-Wing Cannon masters go down for 2 most of the time. Very nice. Plus these guys are worth their weight in gold when fighting against Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. They cannot draw battle destinies by themselves, but they do add a destiny to total power which is very nice. <br>
	Now on to the Jedi Masters. I play the Coruscant: Docking Bay for a place to put Yoda and Master Qui-Gon. It acts as a battleground for Menace Fades and Battle Order/Plan. Both are immune to attrition and because I play 3 Barriers and 2 Houjixs, I feel pretty safe form a beatdown. Plus, I use the Yoda to pull the Alter that I play.<br>
<br>
Interupts<br>
	Yes I am aware that I play 3 copies of both Rebel Barrier and A Few Manuevers. Like I said, this deck is designed to be an anti-Senate TIE deck. A Few Manuevers is on of the keys to getting around those TIEs with cannons. Or if you are holding a Barrier, use it, then drop your own ship and cannon to blow the TIE away instead. <br>
	Another choice that may seem unusual is the Episode 1 Alter. But hey, it cancels Political Effects. Good enough for me.  <br>
	And last, but not least, the Rapid Fire is an excellent interupt to use on Zuckuss when he decides to pounce on one of your solo X-Wings. Play Rapid Fire to deploy a cannon, and then BLAM!. shoot that SOB out of freakin&#8217; space!! (I really dislike Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. Can you tell?)<br>
<br>
So there you have the methods to my madness. On to general usage.<br>
<br>
	Well first things first. As soon as you can, get out Luke and Artoo in Red 5. I ususally pull Naboo with the objective then, deploy Luke in ship to the Rende. Point for 2, then move him to Naboo. After that, just use Luke to pull All Wings Combos to set up matches in your hand, then Squad Assignment for the others. This deck is fully capable of getting all 8 ships out by 3rd or 4th turn. Just makes sure that you have cannons at all of your big drain sites and that is all there is to it.<br>
	You have 4 Jedi Masters and a lightsaber to hold one battle ground. Use your Alter for things like Lat. Damage or SFS. I mean the deck is pretty solid against most decks. Just play well. <br>
<br>
Matchups.<br>
vs Senate TIEs <br>
	Well the deck was designed to take on Senate TIEs, but even this is a hard matchup. This deck can really be disabled by multiple lost Monnoks. Believe me, I know from experience. So keep your hand at a minimum. Recycle your Manuevers as soon as you suspect that your oppenent has a Monnok. Otherwise, Barrier TIEs and shoot them down on yout time and terms. <br>
<br>
vs. Hunt Down<br>
	Another tough matchup, but most Hunt Down decks seem to be weak against heavy space. Just keep your eyes open for a heavy space beat. Visage can circumvented by using Luke&#8217;s retrieval, or by using your Jedi Masters. It is going to be a close game.<br>
<br>
vs. Dark Side Comabt. <br>
	The early big drains are going to hurt, so flip as soon as possible to match them with your own big drains. Typical dark combat decks play very little space, so use your Barriers wisely and beat them into submission. I recommend using your Alter on the inevitable Blast Door Controls.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base flip is one of the most versatile and solid decks that the light side has ever had. Play well and most of all have fun.<br>
Thanks for reading.<br>

Enjoy. Rate nice.<br>
Play on.<br>
