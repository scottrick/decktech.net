<br>
Start with 6 or more force. Try and get obi wan or gui gon down first turn and maybe with their lightsabers, there`s 3 mindful of the future to get out your space locations and get your naboo defense fighters there for quick drains, there is a speak with the jedi council  to get the location out for force generation and to put your jedi there<br>
<br>
There is loads of high destiny in the deck for your jedi to use for lightsaber combat to get rid of darth maul, brisky morning munchen gets jar jar from reserve deck, because there is loads of high destiny he can get rid of characters and he goes straight to the munchen, then he can deploy and kill more people, stay here where it`s safe makes yarua and sio bibble more power<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is alters to cancel their political effects if they play senate, control is to cancel their force drains, jar jar`s electropole is for a destiny of 7 and gui gonns lightsaber from ref 3 is to add to combat destiny rather than the one from tatooine, energy walls is very effective only letting one character  deploy to generator core, the drains on ground and the drains in space, battles and lightsaber combat will be too much for the opponent and you will win<br>
<br>
The defensive shields, a close race suspends watto`s box, a tragedy occurred is to grab one of their interrupts and don`t do that again can get energy walls from reserve deck, here are all 3 matchups<br>
<br>
vs senate<br>
Start with 6 force and you should have a mindful of the future or a space location, get them down and put defense fighters for quick drains, put your characters down on naboo, if maul comes down there is loads of high destiny to combat him, try to kick off the opponent, your drains can`t be cancelled unless there is a dark jedi, there is only one and you should be able to get rid of him<br>
<br>
vs let them make the first move<br>
it`s a bit harder for the opponent because your locations convert there`s at the start, get your space locations out, there is about 5 jedi in this deck and dark side in ep1 have 1, so with the high destiny you should be able to get rid of him, drain them in space and lightsaber combat maul as much as possible and battle them<br>
<br>
vs watto objective<br>
start off with about 7 or 8 force, start by getting your locations out, usually they like to stay on tatooine with maul and watto which is a bit stupid because your force drains can`t be cancelled but if they do there is loads of high destiny to get rid of him, drain them to death and battle<br>
