I try to win the podrace and then use my jedi and epp&#146;s to take care of anything else or get some drains going. <br>
     I start by saving up enough force to deploy shmi to the slave quarters from my reserve deck, and deploying 3P0 and a jedi there as well. This is my &#146;staging area&#146;, where I can keep my people safe while i look for other jedi, lightsabers, and sites. Use 3P0&#146;s gt to get high destinies if your opponient challanges you there. <br>
     Next I initiate a podrace. The only chance your opponient has of winning against you is if he uses sebulba&#146;s pod, and you get low destinies. I suggest tracking as a good way to make sure you get the high destinies you need. Once you win the race, deploy I Did It (you should pull this card on your first turn using anakin&#146;s podracer, as to get a zero destiny out of your deck). This means you retrived a total of 10 force for winning the podrace. <br>
    Searce for City Outskirts to help getting your Jedi out. Padme also helps getting them out. I&#146;d suggest pulling out luke with the outskirts gt, unless you have him in your hand. Then use padme to pull obi and qui-gon out, if you can deploy her. Arm your Jedi with lightsabers and sart draining at any possible place. Get a drain going at coruscant, and you could be draining for 8 or more if you set things up right. <br>
    One of the favorite decks that are being played in my area are dualing and Hunt down the queen. To help protect your jedi from dueling, courage of a skywalker was included. NOOOO protects luke from being converted, and could possibly be a game saver. <br>
     I have fun playing this deck and plan on taking it to my next tourny. It has simple game mechanics, and it is a tournament worth deck. Please leave remarks when you review the deck to help me out, thanx! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
