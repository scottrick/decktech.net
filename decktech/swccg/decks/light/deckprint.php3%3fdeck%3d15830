<br>
Here&#8217;s an EBO deck that avoids the weaknesses of old fashioned EBO decks.  They&#8217;re easily whacked by SFS cannons!  Well, with capitals, you don&#8217;t have that problem!  All the bonuses are the same, except for EBOX retrieval, but that&#8217;s a minor downfall for a help in a huge weakness.  Capitals have massive forfeit, so you&#8217;ll only lose cards to a heavy ground deck.<br>
<br>
This deck is basically a regular EBO deck, like I said, with caps that avoid SFS!! I hate that card.<br>
<br>
Why this card?<br>
<br>
Mon Calamari:  If you have a star cruiser there, then their Star Destroyers can&#8217;t deploy there!  There goes Chimaera!  Also, your cruisers are deploy -1 there (-2 with EBO out, -3 with Ackbar there!)  So, cheap cruisers w/ no beatdown potential.  Awesome.<br>
<br>
Chandrilla:  Force generation is +2 there with a capital there.  Rock on.  You have tons of activation here, so it&#8217;s not a big bonus, but it helps more often than not.<br>
<br>
Orimaarko:  Excellent beatdown card.  They lose 2 force when you beatdown their imperial?  Awesome.  4/4 characters aren&#8217;t too shabby.<br>
<br>
Red Leader/Dutch/Biggs:  2/2 characters with 5 forfeit, 7 when Insurrection is out.  Very very good with Bacta Tank.<br>
<br>
Boussh:  Why not DOS or Leia w/ Rifle?  I think cancelling big drains is better than a once-a-game beatdown.  I have 2 Obi w/ Sabers in there, so they can do the beatdowns (and Lando, Corran, etc etc etc)<br>
<br>
Corvettes:  Low, low, LOW deploy, high power, EXCELLENT forfeit.  Immune to attrition <4 when capital support is out and a pilot is on them.<br>
<br>
Starfighters:  Ok, it&#8217;s not ALL caps, but these ships rock just too much to leave out.<br>
<br>
Launching The Assault:  The most underused effect in the game.  May take Home One into hand?  rock on.  my drains are +1 at systems w/ a cruiser piloted by a character?!!?!?  MORE drains from EBO!  That means at 4 systems, you can have 16 drains a turn!<br>
<br>
Haven:  I like this card.  Deploy on Hoth or Sullust when you&#8217;re about to smash puny TIEs or SDs out of the sky.  Lets see... ships deploy -2 (-4 with Ackbar and EBO out. wow!)  So, corvettes deploy free there!  Ouch time for imps.<br>
<br>
Do Or Do Not combo:  use your grabbers for cheap!  I&#8217;m thinking about taking What&#8217;re You... out for Grappling Hooks for higher destiny.  What do you think?<br>
<br>
Honor:  Helps a lot against several decks.  No Escape stinks, so just lose it if they have it.<br>
<br>
Insurrection:  even though I don&#8217;t have tons of 2/2 pilots here, I still have 6, and with Bacta tank, it rules.  Also protects from the underused Elis Helrot.<br>
<br>
Traffic Control:  You don&#8217;t need many cards in your hand after you have things going.  Recycle good destinies.<br>
<br>
Capital Support:  obvious choice.  pilots deploy -1 to ships, -2 is Ackbar.  So, Ackbar deploys free to Home One, which is pulled from Reserve with Launching The Assault?  Sweet.  Can be pulled with Ackbar too.<br>
<br>
Major Haash&#8217;n:  cancels that damned Lateral Damage.  Also, can be pulled with Ackbar.<br>
<br>
(I won&#146;t have any matchups, since you play the same against every deck, you battle/drain to high hell in space, block cruicial ground drains, and beatdown weak characters)<br>
<br>
Cards I want to add are:<br>
<br>
Bantha Droid:  put him down at Echo Docking Bay, so Lateral Damage is cancelled at Hoth.  Can be pulled with Echo Base Garrison.<br>
<br>
Independence/Defiance/First Officer Threanspi:  I don&#8217;t have them.  :(<br>
<br>
Rock on!  This deck is sweet, and underused.  I love it.  Please check out my other decks!<br>
<br>
Peace out,<br>
