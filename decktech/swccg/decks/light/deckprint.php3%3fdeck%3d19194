Here is the Quiet Mining Colony that i have been using in tournaments for the past few tournaments.<br>
The deck sets up real quickly on the ground as it also does in space and once sets up is very solid.<br>
<br>
Strategy:<br>
early game:<br>
First Priority is to Get Bespin under control, you usually get a pilot or ship on teh first turn, with two wedges hopefully he is the first or second to go down, once you have wedge and any other rogue squdron pilot with an xwing cannon, you should have good control of the system, i have seen players hesitate to put down star destroyers in the fear of power pivot, and bounty hunter ships will just get shot down. Once you have your space safe, set up on the ground and dont forget to add 1 to the deploy cost of opponents characters.<br>
<br>
Mid Game: You should no have a good solid force on teh ground, i like to have epp obi and luke separated with an alien as their back up, leia chewie and han plus pucumir, qui gon phlyo, and corran lando and tawss. I have a large set of aliejns so that my drains are not cancelled by anyone, hopefully, menace fades and battle plan will be in effect so that drains are not paid for and bonus are cancelled. You should try and get celeberation out and if it is cancelled retrieve it with Effective Repairs.<br>
<br>
Late Game: With Pucumir and Ill take the leader, you shoudl be draining for about 13 a turn retrieving 5. Once set up the deck solidly shuts down the opponents bonuses and drains.<br>
<br>
Cards with Noting:<br>
Wedge and Squadron, THe fear of Getting shot down, having battle destiny cancelled and power pivoted is enough to fear any space fleet in coming to bespin.<br>
<br>
ICBW/Its a Hit: These cards are excellent against the watto objective and ITs a Hit combined with the north corridor text is awesome, cancel 2 drains if they control 2 locations<br>
<br>
<br>
61st Cards, Grabber, AWRI/DS<br>
<br>
MAtch Ups<br>
<br>
Senate: Very Easy MAtch Up, Set up in space quickly, get your aliens and mains pairs together, and use path and run luke run to your advantage, you drains cant be cancelled and you should have menace fades, and battle plan which will lock them.<br>
<br>
Watto: Good Match Up, Set up as usually, try and take mos espa with qui gon, use ICBW, and out drain on cc. tough match<br>
<br>
<br>
BHBM: SEt up in space and get the quick flip happening on CC. Set up as normal and out drain. Dont forget the Lose 1 for his objective and deploy +1.<br>
<br>
Court:<br>
STick to your game and deploy to bespin as normal. stick every x wing on bespin. lose 1 every turn. he will be locked once u get out menace fades and battle plan. out drain as normal and beatdown any attemp to come to cc.<br>
<br>
If u want to see how this deck goes read my TR.<br>
<br>
This deck has proven solid, in winning the drain race and coming solid towards the end.<br>
<br>
thanks for reading and hope you enjoy,<br>
