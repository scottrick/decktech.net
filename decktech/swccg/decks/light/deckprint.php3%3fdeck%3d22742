First off thanks to all of you that have taken the time to review my humble deck. Some of you have made good suggestions that I&#8217;ll be tring soon. (Lord Gundark & Son Of Vader) Some of you don&#8217;t get the idea of the deck (Luca/Tzizvvt & Sachmo) or maybe I didn&#8217;t make it clear enough.<br>
<br>
Multiple destinies is only a side benifit. What you want is the hugh force drains at the Swamp and Battle Plains. <br>
<br>
NO Luke? Of course not, read the cards, all of my ability at sites need to be Gungan.<br>
<br>
How do I get battle destiny in space. Yes HC&F is expensive but (again) did you read the card? That card by itself draws 2 battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Let &#8217;em grab Rebel Artillery, it&#8217;s there for the 7 destiny, if I can make them lose force with it also that&#8217;s a plus.<br>
<br>
Monnok! Great card but no one in my meta plays with it, though they may soon start.<br>
<br>
Undercover spies. Yes they can stop one of my big drains, but which one will they stop? The 4 at Battle Plains or 5 at the Swamp. Only a few people in my meta play with them and then only with one in the deck. I still drain for 5 or 6 a turn.<br>
<br>
While you guys made good suggestions and comments (Tzizvvt & Sachmo) you should 1. Read the cards before you review the deck. 2. Review a deck for itself. NO DECK CAN BE MADE TO COUNTER EVERTHING. People must build decks to compete in their own meta or for where ever they wish to compete. Thanks for your comments though and feel free to rake my decks or articles over the coals, but first think about what you say.<br>
<br>
Nobody did this to this deck yet, but also when you review something please keep from being personal and saying things like stupid or this deck sucks. Tell the author the truth and say something helpful. <br>
<br>
Thanks Everyone. On to the strat.<br>
<br>
STRATEGY<br>
<br>
During opponents first turn use Boss Nass&#8217; Chamber&#8217;s to pull Boss Nass.<br>
<br>
On your first turn deploy Boss Nass then use him to pull and deploy Rep Been then use him to pull and deploy Otoh Gunga Entrance (OGE). If Rep Been is not in your reserve deck, pull Steady, Steady and get rep and the location next turn. Next turn pull Steady, Steady if it&#8217;s not out already. You go from generating 3 force on turn one to 6 force on turn two.<br>
<br>
Start deploying your Gungan&#8217;s to OGE, sense they deploy -1 and move from there for free. Do this as long as you have no other or one other site on Naboo. Whenever you want to deploy to the site next to OGE and not battle, deploy to OGE first to save force.<br>
<br>
When your other sites are on the table deploy heavily to the Battle Plans and the Swamp, mostly to the Swamp.<br>
<br>
Deploy all but one of your Guards to the Swamp and mount them on Kaado. Put Tarpals or Jar Jar on a Kaado also. With the Kaado at the Swamp you get force drain bonuses and if ridden by a Guard you can move their awesome defensive and destiny increasing abilities to an exterior battle your opponent mistakenly starts.<br>
<br>
ELECTROPOLES: Use these often but don&#8217;t place them on your Reserve deck unless you have another battle this turn. These things are dangerous. If you can keep these on the table you have three Rebel Artillery to cause direct damage. On your last turn if you can battle and win, use all of your Electropoles and place them on your reserve deck.<br>
<br>
REBEL ARTILLERY: Use as soon as you can. Get those 7&#8217;s back in your deck.<br>
<br>
MINDFUL OF THE FUTURE: With 3 you should be able to get your sites out pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
NSWC & OUT OF SOMEWHERE: Helpful in populating your sites. Great late game retrieval.<br>
<br>
STARSHIPS: Why? Just to hold one system to protect you from Battle Order. You have no systems in this deck because if your opponent plays Battle Order they&#8217;ll deploy a system for you.<br>
Han, Chewie and the Falcon because this card is a beast. Liberty and Spiral because each have ability 2 and a high power/deploy cost/forfeit value ratio. Plus in my Meta X-Wings and Ties with laser cannons are everywhere. I&#8217;m the only one that will even use a capital ship. If there are a lot of capital starships in your area you might want to consider dropping the Liberty and Spiral for a Landing Claw and another Gungan Warrior or a <> Swamp.<br>
<br>
DESTINIES: Minus cards that will obviously be on the table you will have outside of battle or in a battle without Guards, 7x4, 6x2, 5x12, and 4x9. In a battle with a Guard you will have, 7x4, 6x9, 5x20, and 4x9. With this decks ability to draw multiple battle destinies (Boss Nass, Han Chewie and the Falcon, Slight Weapons Malfunction, No Giben Up General Jar-Jar) you could put a serious hurt on anyone that wanders into your little part of the galaxy.<br>
