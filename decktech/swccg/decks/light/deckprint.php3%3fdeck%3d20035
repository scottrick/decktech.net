 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">getting this objective flipped shouldnt be too hard as you get to download the theed palace and with a 1 in 24 chance of getting either maul or a neimoiedian in your opening hand you will be flipping in turn 1. with the droid &amp; blaster racks coupled with An Entire Legion Of My Best Troops and Inconsequential Losses, you`ll be able torecycle your droids and weapons. This deck is techy and can hold against many decks.<br>
<br>
i.e.<br>
3B3-888 - one force maye a character defense value -3<br>
3B3-21 - use x force to reveal top x card (4 only :0(.) and deploy droids for free anything else lost.<br>
3B3-1204 - a force to cancel quis immunity is big<br>
SSA-306  - is brillant against the WYS obj.<br>
OWO-1 w/ Backup - add another driod - 2 destinies<br>
SSA-719 - great against decks that abuse looking through the deck for check purpose.<br>
SSA-1015 - Great against jedis<br>
<br>
use the This Is Not Good to stop him from blowing up the blockage ship<br>
<br>
matchups.<br>
<br>
WYS<br>
Shield can help but if you just go to him after flipping you will take him out. mass deploy at tatooine with atts and driods<br>
<br>
TIGIH<br>
dump on him and kill luke or just leave him alone. if you get rid of luke they don`t get that extra drain and activation.<br>
<br>
DoTF<br>
Could be a problem, so use the Sidious guy to get rid of them after you have mass beatdown on him<br>
<br>
We Have A Plan<br>
have the theed palace full of droids and weapons and have maul there with saber to try and kill panka and /or the queen. could be easy tho.<br>
<br>
MWYHL<br>
out drain them, pity that the battleship wasn`t hyperspeed 4 then we could invade the wrong planet. heheheheheheh<br>
<br>
Hidden Base<br>
Could be a problem after flipping, use the ships to attack them or defend your ship.<br>
<br>
generator<br>
invade the junkyard and get the TT6 and invade with hoards of droids, use ohh switch off to stop targeting yur driods.<br>
<br>
senator<br>
could be hard, react to opponent strategy, but flip and put the heat on him.<br>
<br>
bunker<br>
control the bunker at all times, just invade Endor. shouldn`t be to hard.<br>
<br>
RTP<br>
put a few droids and ensure that they cant free leia. shouldnt be to hard with the amount of droids in the deck.<br>
<br>
free han objective<br>
fortify the jp:ac with droids and protect the art work.<br>
<br>
QMC<br>
invade bespin same as endor, shouldnt be too hard, thought watch out if he does flip.<br>
<br>
blow up the grey ball<br>
could be hard, use the ships to help you<br>
<br>
any other objective that i have missed is purely coincidental.<br>
