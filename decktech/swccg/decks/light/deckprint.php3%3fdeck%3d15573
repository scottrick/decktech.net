(sorry about the pun)<br>
<br>
I originally Thought uo this deck trying to counter Huntdown. Huntdown to me is @#$%, i hate it. this deck stops ther drains at their crappy docking bays and lets you get a good old drain happening up in the sky.<br>
<br>
1st Turn<br>
<br>
Put down any effects you got, use any The Signals or Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes. then if they put down a character 1st turn then put down a spy and an undercover. easy. also deploy any locations.<br>
<br>
2nd Turn they didnt drain and your half set. just put down the spies, move the spies and everything will be peachy.<br>
<br>
Destinies.<br>
<br>
0-5<br>
1-11<br>
2-8<br>
3-12<br>
4-6<br>
5-13<br>
6-7<br>
7-0<br>
<br>
Yes ther are 62 destinies cos of Artoo x2 and his 1 or 6 destiny.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vs Huntdown <br>
Put down Spies, stop the drain. and then drain them for a lowly 4 force until they loose. if they put down all of the half decent characters you expect they may have then deploy a lando with axe to an Executor site with a Chewie and a orrimaarko and drain them for force on the executer too.<br>
<br>
Vs Court/MKOS<br>
<br>
Put out the Artoo a Gift Combo and screw there drains. Also use the spies to stop the other drain of 1 or 2. they wont have hefty space so go beat em up ahrd. if they loose Bossk In Bus there goes their only capital making all of their ships power -2. use you force to take a tatooine site and keep it for yourself. if they play hut smooch dont foret that Bothawui makes them immune to it, so it @#$% for them. if they play a sniper then let them shoot one. just get one of the other 3 to go over there, and (if their stupid enough) they may miss by only getting a 1 for shot destiny.<br>
<br>
Vs TIE&#146;s<br>
<br>
All The protection you need against TIE&#146;s Are you superior Intereupts. if they play all power to weapons, sense it. then if you dont want sense another interrupts then catch it with Wat u trying to push on us. If they make the mistake of Putting down Sienar fleet systems before they put down a TIE to Wakeelmui then Alter it and laugh in there face. HAHAHA. be sure to barrier the dreadnuaght or to barrier the executer or that realy @#$%ty Chimeara Combo. easy win. has won every time against a Tie So Far.<br>

That about it from me so please be sure to rate generously.<br>
