Drop Yoda from deck and deploy the coruscant docking bay too. Draw the remaining force into hand and end turn.<br>
<br>
Turn 2:<br>
You’ll either be able to deploy three senators this turn or one of your jedi.<br>
<br>
Keys:<br>
get threepio and Thrown Back out and utilize them as much as possible to get what you need. Control the senate and set up the political effects for later in the game. Nabrun and yoda a lot to keep opponent off balance while you drain them down. Stick to the ground as much as possible, artoo in red 5 is only there to get luke from place to place.<br>
<br>
I’ll give some match ups even though the deck hasn’t yet been played. So keep in mind that this is all theoretically speaking.<br>
<br>
My Lord Is That Legal?- This could be tough to examine due to the decks total flexability. Does it hunt with Maul, does it invade space with federation, does it swarm with destroyer droids on the ground? I don’t know. It’s too hard to even guess at this deck right now.<br>
<br>
No Money, No Parts, No Deal!- Look for serious ground opposition on this one with a limited space package. It will be key to break thier hold on the junkyard and get the senate to work for you. Maul will usually be hunting Amidala in the wreck so be careful. The podrace can also pop up in this deck so be careful what you lose when. Watto’s box can really kick the crap outof you as well, so maybe sub in it could be worse if your area wreaks of the race.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down- Well they certainly have enough targets to go after don’t they. Problem is that they can only kill a maximum of 4 jedi in a single turn and then they can only pull that off (if your really dumb that is) once a game. So the only thing you really got to worry about is Visage. Hence the Trans. Term. & OFC. Problem solved. Just get to the executor and hold down a site or two and make them hurt. Oh yeah, make sure Vader loses his duel with obi-wan.<br>
<br>
Court Decks- Capturing jedi is hazardous to a bounty hunters health. Storm the audience chamber and make them pay for calling in the hit on the jedi council. Panaka with his blaster can really hurt the hutt butt and his really low forfeit bounty hunters and aliens. Qiu-gon leading the pack will seriously screw the opponent up.<br>
<br>
Dark Deal- You really don’t want them to be able to get set up. Hold on to one site and you can make a big crack in thier plans. Theres no SAC in the deck so be cautious of anything cute. You want to be able to hold a site with authority so do so by going all out. Use the senate to screw with thier plans also, the senators game text will add an advantage that this deck isn’t equiped to deal with.<br>
<br>
BHBM- Kill that dang emperor before he can cause any real problems. Or leave luke at the council chamber and drain with him while your other masters go spank Vader off the table. Hold as much ground as you can to drain with, especially if they’ve got some space in the deck. Then it maybe fun to suicide luke in his x-wing and bring him back for more with their objective!<br>
<br>
SYCFA/TIES-If you have any hope at all start draining fast and early. I hate playing against this deck every time, it doesn’t matter if I play hidden base or WYS, this deck is just way too strong. Make them come to you as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Agents Of Black Sun- Let’s see, this could get nasty. They all live on coruscant. Hmmmmmmm.... fortify the council chamber or else you’ll get a lot more than you bargained for. Maybe hold off on deploying Yoda until you can drop some one else with him. It’s worse now that the dark side has a new coruscant to amp thier power up also. I garuantee you they’ll kick your butt in space. They can’t play senators though. So the senate could be the best thing going for you in this fight. Nice thing is Amidala will be safe at the senate and mace will cuase 2 every turn. That and any other drains and winning battles will help you take this one down.<br>
<br>
ISB/Walkers- This would be a problem if you didn’t have jedi and lots of them to keep pressure on your opponents forces. Clean the machines off the planet site by site. Remeber to keep draining and use the senates powers to your advantage.<br>
<br>
Operatives- Nothing to worry about.<br>
<br>
Sorry I didn’t put a little more thought into it last night when I posted the deck in the first place.<br>
