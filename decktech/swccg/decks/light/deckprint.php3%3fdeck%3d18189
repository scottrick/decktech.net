<br>
***-1 for the strategy. I am here to learn things about decks, not be insulted by the strategy section. -.25 because I think you should drop the podrace, although it looks like you have something in their for it. -.25 because you have little SAC protection and because I think you do not generate enough force, and you give your opponent a lot of force. You have had much better. <br>
<br>
thanks norite for the review<br>
<br>

***there are much better versions of WYS podracing. I dont think you have enough race interrupts to win against a dedicated DS podracing deck  <br>
