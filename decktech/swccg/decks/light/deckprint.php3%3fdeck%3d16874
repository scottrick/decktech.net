At Ramapo I played Test One but for the Team Tourney I changed it for the 3rd A Step Backward. If you want change it back in. If you don&#8217;t want to test to one change the Training area to the Bog Clearing. Sorry about that.<br>
<br>
And why the grabbers with no wise advice? Becuase I don&#8217;t mind paying for them and I normally save about 5-6 force a turn if I have a decently sized hand.<br>

Charlie had been playing around with a hit and run mains deck that had podracing and superfalcon that started MWYHL. When we got to ramapo I didn&#146;t have a LS decided upon but I did like the look of Charlie&#146;s deck. After going from room to room I noticed that ground was the most popular, and HDADTJ jizz would be running rampant. I decided to take the platform of Charlie&#146;s deck but remade it into a beatdown deck that is full of tech (Jedi Escape is TECH!). I played against 3 huntdown jizz decks over the weekend and won each game by 20+.<br>
<br>
This deck is solid and performed well for me at Ramapo losing only 3 games all weekend for me- to Charlie Herren, Dominic from Canada, and Ed the Michigan state runner-up. Also Adam Drake used a carbon copy of this deck and only lost 1 game with it over the weekend. Props to Alex Tennet.  <br>
<br>
This deck is simple...beat down with mains...win the podrace...play defensively untill there is an opening. The space package is minimal becuase I didn&#8217;t expect a lot of space at Ramapo and besides the ISB space there really wasn&#8217;t a lot. The ships I play can disrupt people in space, they aren&#8217;t going to clear space for you. This deck is 1-0 against ISB space beating Mike Dalton by 15 during the DPC.<br>
<br>
This is a very good deck, play smart, start DDTA against Mob Points or IAO/YCHF. <br>
<br>
This deck wins by a lot. At Ramapo I had atleast 3 games with dif of over 30 with it.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
