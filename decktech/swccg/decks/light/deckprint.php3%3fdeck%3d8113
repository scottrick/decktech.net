The first thing you see with this deck is the minimal space support. You don't really need a whole lot of space with this deck, Really what can the dark side do in space. This deck will usually win a drain race, just because of the flip side of the objective. Secondly all the interrupts in this deck, you really are prepared for alot. The narrow escape + Order to engage combo can be deadly. I am thinking about adding some &quot;Lost in the wilderness&quot; I was at a tourney recently and saw how potent this card can be.<br>
<br>
Obviously every region plays different cards, so I am not going to break this down into a vs strategy (eg: vs Ralops, vs Court).<br>
Just try this deck for yourself, it is a very strong deck. I may make a 2.o ver with some more changes.<br>
<br>
I'll give you an idea of this decks power. I just beat a Ralops deck last week, by 39. I flipped my objective ASAP, and started draining and letting the objective do it's thing.<br>
He decides he can't take it anymore, and deploys Vaderw/saber&amp;Tarkin&amp;Mara w/saber to the Aud chamber. I have Ben w/saber &amp; boush &amp;Han. I play &quot;double agent&quot;  and take out Mara. He iniates a battle, I &quot;run,luke,run&quot; Master luke w/saber to the battle.<br>
I &quot;clash Of Sabers&quot; Tarkin. He Swings first I play &quot;Swing and a Miss&quot;. I then go on to play 1)skywalkers 2)Don't get cocky 3)Gift of the mentor 4)Courage of a skywalker  5)Smoke screen. -- and that was the end of that game. I won by 39, we played again - this time he was a bit smarter, and I won by 18.<br>
My point is, this deck has the read cards to help you lay a beating; and with the force generation - You will always get the cards you need.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
