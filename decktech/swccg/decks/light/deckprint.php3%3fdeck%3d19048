It has gone 9-1 in games in sanctioned and it&#146;s only loss was to a profit with 4 Lukes that eeked out a win by 6 cos I couldn&#146;t find another character to kill the last Han with 4LOM. <br>
<br>
Disruptor Pistol props to Simon Durston who has helped me make this deck into a menace in the local environment.<br>
<br>
Obviously put the presence on the ICity to get the flip. They lose 1, drain for 1 then you flash and drive off. Normally I get someone to back up Xizor first turn, if not, take your chance see what happens.<br>
<br>
Ideally you win the podrace by 3rd turn, 4 sometimes and that hurts them.<br>
<br>
Midgame you normally get Emp + BDroid + Gun at a site, with Xizor, Guri and another BDroid with Gun at another with keeping little wrecking crews in your hand to kill people who spread.<br>
<br>
Card choices:<br>
I use the battleground versions of locations because Honor would slow this deck down so I need to get some battlegrounds if they do not provide.<br>
Grotto because alot of LS players are still using docking bays as their locations and this causes some nice pain if I can clear the site to drain - plus he is a different ability 4 black sun agent.<br>
Imperial Artillery - I love this card. I believe Black Sun is an objective best used for direct, unmodifiable damage and these cards work wonderfully. Use them in your control phase and you have got 2 7s on the bottom of your reserve deck, tracking made easy.<br>
SDMechanism + OSOff - between this and inconsequential losses you should seldom lose a character from battle. Forfeit weapons for 3 to used pile (both Destiny 6 and 4) and if someone targets your non-droid, retarget it with SDM, making the targetting the top-level action then cancel it OSO. It really annoys the opponent to no end.<br>
Counter Assault mid or end game with these destinies can win the game or at least strike fear into the opponent and make them reshuffle their draining characters.<br>
<br>
Destiny (after starting stuff is out)<br>
0: 2<br>
1: 6<br>
2: 2<br>
3: 12<br>
4: 7<br>
5: 8<br>
6: 10<br>
7: 4<br>
<br>
29 cards of 4 or higher. I know it looks very red intensive but it works. SDM and OSO are non-unique so if they get sensed play another. IArtillery is also immune and since cards are the most important to me, I need no SAC protection.<br>
<br>
Match ups:<br>
<br>
Really to many to list in todays environment but<br>
<br>
HB Flip: Most play 1 or 2 lukes at max so no real problem in getting the damage happening. Try to isolate ships in force pile and pick them up to go probing. Not many at present where I am.<br>
<br>
Profit: Take out Han, not Luke as there really is not enough beef to take out both. The profit damage is a real killer and will be tough to overcome.<br>
<br>
WYS: Not any here but would be a tough game due to destiny adding. Try to clear a docking bay and get Grotto in there to help drain them back.<br>
<br>
Thats about it.<br>
Hope you like it.<br>
