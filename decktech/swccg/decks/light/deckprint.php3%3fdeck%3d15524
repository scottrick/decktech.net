<br>
Before I get started, I will explain that EBO is NOT the big part of this deck.  It&#8217;s more of a side note against ground decks.  Now here we go.<br>
<br>
I noticed that almost no one plays with clouds anymore.  I don&#8217;t see why not, because they ROCK BIG TIME with rebel starfighters.  Here&#8217;s how you play it:<br>
<br>
1st Turn:  Yank Echo Commander Center and the Echo Docking Bay.  Deploy TK-422 or Boussh, if possible, if they get a really quick drain going.  Do not draw, unless you don&#8217;t have any tunnel visions in your hand.<br>
<br>
2nd turn:  Yank out Hoth, deploy it, and any clouds you have in your hand.  Deploy Tibanna Gas Miners and/or Kebyc.  Use tunnel vision if you need a card (make sure you have a large force pile)<br>
<br>
3rd turn:  Pull out EBO and Echo Corridor if you have 3 characters to get it going.  Otherwise, yank out Sullust or Kashyyyk.  Deploy more clouds, make sure you have 3 tibanna gas miners on table and 1 kebyc.  Deploy squadron assignments (or look for it with a large force pile) and deploy it.  Save the force.<br>
<br>
4th turn:  Yank out a system.  Deploy all effects / admirals orders / etc.  By now you will probably have 2/3 tibanna miners and kebyc out.  deploy some ships to the clouds (1 at each).<br>
<br>
For the rest of the game, drain away!  If you have Leia out and Reflection, retrieve the 1 force every turn (you have plenty of force).  Remember to drain at your Echo sites w/ the clouds&#8217; game text, and to add to the drain with miners, and to add to the drain with Kian, and to add to the docking bay drain w/ I&#8217;ll Take The Leader.  And if you&#8217;re not opposed in space, deploy some ships to Sullust and Kashyyyk (try to get Outrider to Sullust so you can have a net worth of 12 power).  Also, if you can, get Wedge RSL with another Red ship or Corran Horn.  He rules like that.  Remember your power is +3 everywhere.  Remember you can drain for a maximum of 20 every turn, relatively quick.  And 7 of that from Reserve w/ Kebyc and Kian at a cloud sector.  This rules, really.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
