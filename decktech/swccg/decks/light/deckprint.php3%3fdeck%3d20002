Such as the sense and alter killers, the grabber, retrieval hosers, and odd deck type hosers. These will prove to be the most beneficial in the long run.<br>
<br>
Record<br>
4-0 in tournament play.<br>
23-0 in casual play.<br>
<br>
The destinies are fairly high and easily stackable due to cards like Threepio and the claw fish. The numbers themselves break down as follows:<br>
<br>
0-3<br>
1-10<br>
2-6<br>
3-6<br>
4-8<br>
5-6<br>
6-6<br>
7-6<br>
<br>
This ratio allows you to hold most of the lower destiny cards in hand to keep your destinies high if you have to draw blindly. Also in tournament play this deck hasn’t lost more than 19 cards in one match.<br>
<br>
Early Game- Concentrate on getting your locations in play. Hold extra copies of low destiny cards in your hand. Threepio to re-seed your deck with the higher destiny cards as your able. Unless the opponent is playing a dueling Hunt Down or the dark combat objective only place one combat card under your jedi at the generator and core. Use your EPP’s to clear sites with suicide runs while backing them up with Resilience. Maintain an early control on the generator core to prevent the three loss possible there.<br>
<br>
Mid Game- Maintain your control of your key sites. Projection your opponents other sites to keep there options limited. If they can’t drain you they will have to come to you to do some battle damage. This is where it is essential to use the claw fish. Even if you have less power than the opponent you can still hit their characters and cause massive amounts of attrition. Try to get Padme and Mace to their respected sights and get the direct 2 going along with your heavy drains.<br>
<br>
Late Game- The Council Chamber should be on the table at this point with most of your council members there. Utilize their game text to interfere with the opponent’s draws and battles. If you plan to use the council to battle with keep the R3 Yoda with them to provide them with immunity to attrition. This creates one of the nastiest little packs of characters that the dark side will ever have to deal with. Keep your jedi paired at the very least and maintain control of the Naboo sites to keep draining. One good battle consisting of Luke and Obi-Wan with Gift Of The Mentor should finish the opponent off in the late game.<br>
<br>
Match-ups-<br>
<br>
TIES- Of no real concern. You drain very heavily very quickly. If they bring down the beat squad it is not a problem for this deck. Dark jedi are very foolish indeed to wander into the generator or core. And all of those less than 5 ability scrubs the dark side has are immediately gone when hit at the core. In my opinion, and this is from praticle experience, you will win versus ties.<br>
<br>
TDIGWATT (Dark Deal)- Power or speed makes little difference. A city full of jedi spells doom for their deal. Suicide EPP’s or Jedi hit squads make short work of this deck on the ground. With judicious use of Jar Jar and his in battle game text this deck has very little chance to get going.<br>
<br>
My Lord, Is That Legal?- Ignore them and drain. Projection their sites and make them come to you. Again the Suicide EPP’s to the senate with the Gift will cause more damage than the deck can contend with.<br>
<br>
Scum (All forms)- Scum dies hard to this deck. So many weapons to deal with the scum of the universe. The EPP combo, rigged destinies and interference with their draws as well. Not to mention the shear power of the council. A fun and easy game.<br>
<br>
Walker Garrison- Just kill their walkers and their deck is screwed. They won’t be able to get a good drain off the whole game. Just don’t you forget to keep draining.<br>
<br>
Let Them Make The First Move- Stick to your guns and drain while you can. Double up on your combat cards here. You should win this one but use Threepio to stack destinies just in case you have to draw blind.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down- Jar Jar kills Visage and Jedi kill dark Jedi. If they battle go fishing and if they duel use your combat cards. Remember to use the Councils text to mess them up too. Drain them down and you should take this one without too much trouble.<br>
<br>
Invasion- Well this nasty little deck has a real chance at killing jedi. That is if you don’t pay attention. Just lose extras from hand to their drains at the system and keep draining them out on the ground. your grabber shield and retrieval hosers will help you out here a lot. If they dare drop Lord Maul or Darth Sidious combat them off the table and move away from a beat down. Your barriers can really save your tail too. evade, block drains, and stay unflipped. You’ll take the game. And if you really want to tick them off drop Jar Jar to the Viceroy&#146;s site even if he&#146;s surrounded by droids. Make sure you&#146;ve stacked a seven and use Jar Jar&#146;s in battle text and take the lump out. It flips them and they lose tons of benefits. Watch for that unhealthy shade of red thier face turns too.<br>
<br>
Well thats all that I’ve got. The decks record has impressed me very much. I usually have trouble with my light side, but this deck has been the exception. Give it a try and enjoy.<br>
