-Cut All Wings Report In combo for They Win This Round.<br>
<br>
<b>Update #2:</b><br>
1. I knew I&#8217;d have to do this for some reviews, because DeckTech is notorious for stupid people.<br>
<br>
&#8221;nice deck, but a very strange style to play a WYS! First of all, play 3 starting Effects, for example Menace Fades!!! cause what you are goin&#8217; to do if you lose Menace Fades???? or just play &#8221;Your Insight Serves You Well&#8221; cause with this you san pull out &#8221;Honor Of The Jedi&#8221; and this effect will keep you alive against Watto Decks!!! <br>
Then you should think about your characters, too many copies like Han!!! why don&#8217;t you play 2 & 3 Palace Raider with enclosed vehicles so they can&#8217;t be target by weapons!!!! nice deck,Enjoy and keep improving...DeckTech&#8221;<br>
  <br>
mighty_maul <br>
<br>
To start, I have an update section specifically for the third starting effects. &#8221;If you can&#8217;t understand that, you shouldn&#8217;t be rating the damn deck. It&#8217;s not f*cking brain science here.&#8221; - Brad Reinhold<br>
<br>
As for too many Hans, WTF? See above quote.<br>
<br>
2. As for no Falcon, I played it both days, but I can always throw the beats on Outrider or something. Also, Capital Support I played Day Two but only because I thought it was nifty.<br>
<br>
<b>Update #1:</b><br>
1. There was some question to my third starting effect. The default is Insight combo, but against Dark Deal and other obvious drain decks, start Menace Fades. I&#8217;ve never started Draw Their Fire, and I don&#8217;t see any reason to since you put out people early to flip. <br>
<br>
2. They Win This Round is definitely sexy, even sexier because I pull it with the DDTA shield. Thanks to Rob and Luca for that suggestion. As for Run Luke Run, it&#8217;s defintely a good card, but not in this type of beats. I&#8217;m not using the tripler, so its only use it to look good. And cancelling Vader&#8217;s Obsession isn&#8217;t important because I have two Resiliences, plus I can win the game without ever playing Luke; it has happened many times before.<br>
<br>
3. John Irving is officially my b!tch.<br>
<br>
<b>Background:</b><br>
I told myself before Worlds, that my LS deck would consist of:<br>
<br>
Shocking Information & Grimtassh<br>
Other Cards x59<br>
<br>
Yes, Grimtassh is that damn good... my first time ever playing it was Day One. My second game ever with it, I played Maxim Briand&#8217;s Senate manipulator. I Grimtasshed lost when he had a 15 card hand and 7 of those were dupes (2 Lotts, 3 Vote Nows, 2 of something else). I never needed the Grimtassh from lost pile, but it was always a threat to keep him from drawing big hands.<br>
<br>
I went to an unsanctioned team tournament (which we won cool trophies for), and one of the games I got my @$$ handed to me by Henry Jicha because he played Han, the new Chewie and Life Debt, along with Capital Support to limit Vader and Fett to one destiny. I was somewhat mad in general because I saw potential, but he ruined the greatness of that combo because he was using a space/racing/weird thing. So I&#8217;m talking to Brad Reinhold a week later, and we think about that combo in a solid WYS, and how insane it would be. Brad tells me to get on AIM and tell Hayes what we just came up with, and Hayes says to check Brad&#8217;s e-mail. I go into Brad&#8217;s mail account and there&#8217;s the deck typed up. Sweet! It looks different from my style, so we fix it up and start testing. It owns the HD everyone&#8217;s praising here and I&#8217;m set.<br>
<br>
So Thursday night I get to FCon with a LS that the Defensive Shield Eater was based on before the Numbers and weird janky stuff =P. That doesn&#8217;t fly in my two testing games, so I switch to WYS at 6 in the morning. It goes 3-1 for me Day One, losing only to Tim Guzman, but beating a bunch of good people. That night, while I&#8217;m asleep, Brad picks at the deck and takes out Honor and other things, so in the morning I have like 5 empty slots so I fill them in. I&#8217;m rushed, so I grab 5 shields and that&#8217;s my deck. It goes 2-1 on Day Two, beating Brian Hunter and David Irvine, while losing to Tim Guzman YET AGAIN! <br>
<br>
Now, after I have the decklist in front of me and having time to think about it, this is what I&#8217;ve finished with. <br>
<br>
<b>Strategy:</b><br>
To play this deck correctly, you need only to use these four shields:<br>
<br>
A Tragedy Has Occured<br>
Battle Plan<br>
Don&#8217;t Do That Again<br>
Your Insight Serves You Well<br>
<br>
For Day Two, I used Do, Or Do Not instead of Don&#8217;t Do That Again, probably becaused I mixed up the names from lack of sleep. Also, I played Planetary Defenses, but you don&#8217;t need to because you aren&#8217;t normally in the Cantina.<br>
<br>
The great thing about this deck is it plays like WYS solid in drawn out games (See my TR for the game against Brian Hunter) and it plays like WYS Beats in most games (See TR for the game against Charles Hickey/David Irvine/Paul Evans/... =)<br>
<br>
If you play Tim Guzman on a regular basis, don&#8217;t play this because he owns it. <br>
<br>
This is like WYS Solid, except for one thing: the potential beats.<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ll give an example from one of my Day One games. I was playing against a DS Combat, and he was causing too much damage for me to deal with (since I don&#8217;t play retrieval). He had Janus and the Emperor and his 2/2 site and Lord Vader w/ Stick and Dr. E at my Cantina. I put Chewie in front of the Emperor, and wait for 5 seconds. I&#8217;d given him enough time to declare an action, and he wasn&#8217;t shuffling through his hand, so I cancelled the Emperor&#8217;s text. Next, I played EPP Han and I cancelled the Barrier with B!tch Shuffle. I fight, play Life Debt (ALWAYS PLAY THIS AS YOUR FIRST ACTION!), shoot Janus, and draw my 5 destinies. Chewie adds 2 to each, so I&#8217;m at a base of 10, and the destiny is farely good, so he loses 20+ overflow somewhere around 7th turn, with no destiny setup. I lost Chewie to attrition, and if he would&#8217;ve attacked Han, I play Life Debt from Lost Pile and grab the other Chewie from reserve. 3 destinies and a shot will clear him off again. <br>
<br>
Okay, you all know how to play WYS solid, and how the beats work, so I&#8217;ll explain some of my card choices. <br>
<br>
<b>Card Choices:</b><br>
<br>
<i>A Few Maneuvers</i> - It&#8217;s a nice 6 for tracking, but it was mainly because I was scared of Senate TIEs. Senate TIEs played by a good player beats WYS 9 times out of 10.<br>
<br>
<i>Goo Nee Tay x2</i> - Hayes sent us the decklist, and that is his trademark. I didn&#8217;t have anything better to add in. <br>
<br>
<i>Honor Of The Jedi</i> - Why does no good player use this? It is only useless (and not totally) <b><u>IF</b></u> No Escape is on the table. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t like losing to Visage.<br>
<br>
<i>Revolution</i> - WYS has no spy smugglers, huh? This is great when they leave people at docking bays, not afraid of the spy beatdown. Also good with Goo Nee Tay early game. (Read the game against Brian Hunter) I&#8217;ve recently started pulling Kessel, but only deploying it late game, and that works great with Goo and Revolution. But, if you&#8217;re in a close game and you can go to space, then play it early and just try for the beats on the ground to win it for you.<br>
<br>
<i>Shocking Information & Grimtassh</i> - Helps when they draw big hands for anti-beatdown cards, helps to keep them in check, helps against Senate manip, helps just to check their hand, then do it some other time from lost pile. It&#8217;s just a damn good card.<br>
<br>
<i>Sorry About The Mess & Blaster Proficiency x2</i> - I don&#8217;t know what it is about this card, but it makes my pants become tighter whenever I use it. So I can cut your EPP Maul, then send him to lost before he does anything to me? So I can add 3 for Han to cap the Emperor? Sweet!<br>
<br>
<i>The B!tch Shuffle & Desperate Reach x2</i> - Normally I&#8217;d use 1/1 of the Barrier cancellers, but I used two of these for worlds to keep people from tracking. The title should be my nickname for it, because people get pissed when you play it.<br>
<br>
This deck will win consistently for you against everything, except Senate. I&#8217;ve just figured out how to beat it (although only about 80% consistent), so I&#8217;m not about to share it with the world. If you ever feel pressure, draw a big hand, try to cut their diff through a beatdown, then count yours when you win. (See the game against Paul Evans)<br>
<br>
Since you&#8217;ve made it this far, I&#8217;ll let you know what the title means. Refering to the deck, This Is What It Feels Like To Be F*cked By A Dinosaur.
