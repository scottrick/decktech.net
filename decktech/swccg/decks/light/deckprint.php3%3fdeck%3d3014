for some early activation.  You should try and get<br>
reactor terminal out ASAP so that you can start<br>
cycling through your deck without fear of Monnok.<br>
Get whatever out to slow down your opponent.  You<br>
should be able to get a small fleet out to Tibrin<br>
and start re-using lost ships, Kessel Runs, TTs<br>
and Lukes.  Also, start something (usually the<br>
falcon) doing the Kessel Run.  Your opponent may<br>
deploy Secret Plans, but I wouldnt worry about it because<br>
you should generate enough force.  The Organized<br>
Attacks are there to get ships early, you should<br>
try and dump them all cheaply at the Rendezvous<br>
Point to avoid Monnok.	The Redemption and Eject!<br>
Eject! are looking to be replaced by another<br>
Organized Attack and an X-Wing gun in version 1.2.<br>
The main weakness seems to be Big Blue, so maybe I<br>
need to add B-Wings and Intruder Missiles or<br>
Docking and Repair Facilities or something.<br>
Pretty basic HB really, just wait until you can<br>
whittle away at your opponents fleet before you<br>
flip so that you can hopefully lock him down,<br>
retrieve your entire lost pile and put all your<br>
starfighters in your used pile (but Ill settle<br>
for just winning if that doesnt work).	On to<br>
specifics!<br>
<br>
Vs.  Ops<br>
<br>
Battle plan and TPTIFF need to come out quickly.<br>
Between 2 spies, 2 POAS, 1 ICBW and Kessel Run you<br>
shouldnt lose too much force.  Flip late and<br>
apply beats on ships as needed.<br>
<br>
Vs.  Hunt Down<br>
<br>
DEPLOY TIBRIN EARLY!  This is the key to beating<br>
HDADTJ, you need it to get back any systems that<br>
you lose, retrieve Transmission Terminated and<br>
give you access to your lost pile (eg.	If you<br>
lose TK-422 off the top, its almost like drawing<br>
him).  Get Kessel Run set up, only cancel Visage<br>
when they flip (it helps you if you get Tibrin set<br>
up).<br>
<br>
Vs. COTVG<br>
<br>
Heres where you need the X-Wing gun : )  A spy<br>
will stop the chamber-visage and you can take over<br>
Tatooine to try and stop any occupations going on.<br>
The major problem with this matchup is that they<br>
may be playing Oota Goota Solo?, which can cancel<br>
Kessel Run.  Minimise their drains, grapple Oota<br>
Goota Solo? and get your Kessel Runs (or Run, if<br>
you decide to play a more tuned version of this<br>
deck) back.<br>
<br>
Vs. TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
This is harder.  Try and beat them up at the<br>
system to get TPTIFF working (I really think I<br>
should put that damn X-Wing gun in!) and Kessel<br>
Run overtime.  Watch out for Tallon Roll (LiMF is<br>
immune).<br>
<br>
Vs.  ISB OPS<br>
<br>
BATTLE PLAN!  Your best shot against them, TPTIFF<br>
will work if they are on 1 planet, but dont count<br>
on it.	Treat it like ops, 2 POAS, 2 Spies (how<br>
ironic) but dont forget to apply beats with<br>
Obi-Wan and Luke (them ghhking is irrelevant, all<br>
that matters is that you are slowing them down).<br>
As always, dont forget to Run!<br>
<br>
Vs. Ralltiir Ops<br>
<br>
You may be able to stop them from flipping (but<br>
dont base your game plan around it).  Things get<br>
ugly when it is flipped, but if you keep a rebel<br>
barrier ready and can dispatch their ships you<br>
should be fine.  They may also suffer from an<br>
early force-choke, so you may be able to dump<br>
Obi-Wan/Luke down and kill some guys.  If you can<br>
out battle them, their drains will be small enough<br>
for you to deal with.<br>
<br>
Vs. Big Blue<br>
<br>
Im not too sure about this one ...  Once again,<br>
flip only when required (you may prefer to not<br>
deploy Kessel and Kiffex if you can just pick them<br>
up).  The reason that I built this deck is because<br>
I think that this may be on the decline, with so<br>
many good dark ECC and EJP characters running<br>
round and 2 new objectives.  Multiple battle<br>
destinies with Out Of Nowhere should help (dont<br>
forget, RFCs add one to manoeuver, so a Y-Wing<br>
with one piloting can use it).	Their ground<br>
drains should be get-aroundable.  If you can get<br>
some retrieval going, and a Mantellian Savrip<br>
thats not cancelled, you should be fine.  Its<br>
all about out-battling them.<br>
<br>
Vs.  Anything Wierd<br>
<br>
Use your brains.  This decks built to be<br>
flexible.<br>
