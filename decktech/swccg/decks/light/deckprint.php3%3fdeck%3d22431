Concentrate All Fire </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, this is an old-fashioned deck that has always been strong and it is perfect for the current meta. The basic idea is simple: you will draw up and pull your stuff with A New Secret Base for the first 2-3 turns and as soon as you have what you need to set up EBO, drop it down and the spread to your 3 systems and plop Luke or Qui-Gon down to the North Ridge. This is pretty mcuh just a drain-race deck except that you&#8217;ll have the advantage in practically every matchup. If your opponent is foolish enough to deploy to space, then the game is as good as yours. After 3 good turns of drawing you should have all the tools you need to win.<br>
On the ground:<br>
The 1 battleground is all that you need to concern yourself about (so you can satisfy Battle Plan/Order and Menace Fades). The North Ridge is perfect because you opponent will rarely deploy there for fear of the Ice Storm (which incidentally is the 61st card in here). If they do come down, you simply have to Barrier and if that fails just lose from hand or Houjix. The big thing, though, is that Qui-Gon is completely immune to attrition and with your Admirals Order out Luke will be immune < 8 so you should be able to survive with a character still there. NEVER BATTLE OFF HOTH. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. Just let your drain cancellation (Rebel Fleet, Bargaining Table, Projection Of A Skywalker and Menace Fades) take care of that. The Battle Plan then becomes you friend as you force them to come to space or simply lose.<br>
In space:<br>
If they deploy to space then just be ready to kill them. I do not recommend deploying more that 1 X-wing per system if you have an Alternatives to Fighting (may be more costly than Hyper Escape, but it is only cancelled by Sense). If they try to come down on you, cancel the battle or just Houjix the damage. Then it&#8217;s your turn. Use your Organized Attacks sparingly (especially if they have the grabber out). Once you do start fighting in space, you will easily be able to over power them as each X-wing will be power 4 with Incom, 5 with Organized Attack, and your total power will be +3 from EBO. DO NOT DEPLOY CANNONS UNLESS YOU INTEND TO USE THEM. Save the Cannons for beatdowns (remember: you have to have a Cannon to play Power Pivot). Save the Spiral. It is you best defense against Battle Deployment if you do not get your AO.<br>
<br>
Card Choices:<br>
Alternatives to Fighting: Yes, as I said, it may cost more than Hyper Escape but you will almost never have this cancelled while there are 129380123439230984 cards that cancel Hyper Escape.<br>
Baragwins and Ishi Tibs: Well, if it was not already obvious, these have several advantages. 1) cheap deploy; 2) Bargaining Table; 3) Nar Shaddaa to pull them; 4) Nar Shaddaa for late game retrieval; 5) Ishi Tibs allow you to track or put back unnecessary cards; 6) Baragwins retieve X-wing Cannons.<br>
Concentrate All Fire: Makes X-wings with Cannons even better and adds to Lukes immunity at a related site. Kicks Battle Deployment off of the table.<br>
Order To Engage: Late game after they have wasted their Shields. Kills them quicker. Always good for a laugh.<br>
The rest should be self-explanitory.<br>
<br>
Match-Ups:<br>
Dark Deal: Spread and drain and set up the Menace Fades. They will be unable to hold a system, so the Battle Plan will kill then. I have played this matchup 3 times with Tom McGee and all 3 times the Executor was taken down and a Ghhhk went with it. You will out-drain them (be sure to pull the Ultimatum Shield).<br>
Lightsaber Combat: Rather easy matchup as long as you can set up the Fades quickly. Otherwise, the Ultimatum works well. If they pull the Maul in Infiltrator bull@#$%, just kill them with Order To Engage (yes, I realize that Tatooine Maul will make me disappear, but Combat decks use Lord Maul). Your retrieval will destroy them as will your drains and Battle Plan.<br>
Senate TIEs:<br>
By far the toughest matchup. You can about match them for drain blocking and retrieval, but you have the advantage in the size of your drains and the fact that you will have a much easier time holding a battleground site. GRAB ALL POWER TO WEAPONS! Always save at least 1 Force after turn 1 until you get it. This will save your life. Use your Alternatives sparingly (keep in mind that it is officially a just action so they do not get to fire their Cannons before you get to play it). Cancel battles then drop YOU Cannons on THEIR head.<br>
Uhhh... what else are people playing these days?<br>
Anything else ground based (Hunt Down, BHBM, Invasion, etc.) should be an easy win. Probably the hardest matchup is...<br>
Big Blue ISB: Deploy sparingly and go for beatdowns. Try to outdrain them and satisfy Menace Fades. The winner of this game will be decided by the better draw or who plays better... it is that much of a toss-up.<br>
