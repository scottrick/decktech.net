This is standard there is in good in him with a little twist. With all the new dueling decks u can get a good beat down and get dueling cards early. All the cards are cheap do deploy and easy beatdown. Mulitple destiny adders are great and fabolous. Watch out for crush the rebellion and guri. <br>
Card choices:<br>
<br>
Nabrun leids: some people never deploys the docking bay for me so I just go there during move phase and say hi. <br>
<br>
Protector, life debt, and don&#8217;t get @#$%y is great for destiny adders. Nice for clearing sites.<br>
<br>
Out of commission: why no combo card? Because this is a free to use. Easy beatdown on maul and out of commision for free in first or second turn kills any dueling card.<br>
<br>
Scramble: use it after defensive cards been pulled and make them drop there jaw.<br>
<br>
Jar jars pole: nice card what can I say<br>
<br>
Home one: Yes only ship but it&#8217;s a one hell of a ship.  <br>
<br>
Demotion: tarkin or admiral thrawn  good example<br>
<br>
Some match ups:<br>
<br>
Dueling decks: beatdown fast and hard. Don&#8217;t out of commsion vader. U have a good chance to turn him. Beat the hell out of maul every chance<br>
<br>
Mkos: good attacks in the chamber and do damage. That&#8217;s all u can do. Drain them fast and furious<br>
<br>
Dark deal: Beat down and resistance will help<br>
<br>
Senate: U can have more power in the senate then they. Most of the guys are leaders and have politics 2 plus the destiny adders does a good job<br>
<br>
Ties and space: good luck. Load up the home one hope that they don&#8217;t lateral damage it. Drain at back door with lukes saber and saber profiency. Midge will help<br>
<br>
Hoth: go and beat down on some walkers and laugh. Maker sure u win the drain race. Nothing I can give for help.<br>
