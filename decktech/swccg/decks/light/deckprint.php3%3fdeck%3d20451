<br>
one think: DONT RATE THIS DECK BEFORE YOU READ THE STRAT.<br>
<br>
well, this is my 1000 version of a TIE deck, nearly every 2 month I try to build a really strong deck with TIES, and now I think this deck could win, ehm, lets say it could win locals easy.<br>
but let this, now I start with the strategy:<br>
<br>
1 turn: always the same<br>
Before activate force pull wakeelmui from reserve deck. if you have a sienar or a twilek in hand: perfect start. if not, it doesnt really matters. Now activate force and look for a card with Death star in title (of course the war room). at same time check your deck if a sienar or twilek is in.<br>
if yes then draw until you get it.<br>
If you have sienar in hand, then deploy it. deploy to the DS:DB one Tie Scout to retrieve a force and to get a better activation next turn.<br>
<br>
What is to do if you have X in hand where X =<br>
<br>
Piett: deploy on death star: DB; searches for Merrejk<br>
Merrejk: Deploy on War Room (better protection); searches for the systems<br>
A tie PILOT: If you have a cannon in hand then battle him away at a system he controls.<br>
                   If you have no cannnon then look if opponent is strong at this system, or if he can             <br>
	       hurt you. if yes, then deploy him to your system to drain.<br>
	       If not then battle him. His damage will be always more than yours, because the           <br>
                   TIE goes to Used Pile and next turn you can retrieve the pilot.<br>
	       No way for opponent, all TIES come back.<br>
A unpiloted TIE: the same. siehe oben.<br>
TIE scout: ALWAYS deploy to DS:DB --&gt; explained later<br>
Scythe Squadron TIE: ALWAYS to your systems --&gt; explained later<br>
<br>
Where To use All Power to Weapons?<br>
2 Possibilities: First, of course, to better your TIE Interceptor and make them immune to attrition. Second, to make you TIE at the DS:DB immune to attrition.<br>
It&#146;s pretty important to occupy this location because of battle order.<br>
<br>
Why Never Yalnal?<br>
This cards make your Undercover Spys &quot;immune to corran horn&quot;, because with the high destinies in deck it&#146;s pretty easy to kill corran horn.<br>
<br>
Why the single Dark Maneuvers:<br>
There&#146;s only one reason: I have only 5 Dark Maneuvers &amp; Tallon Roll.<br>
<br>
Why Dark Maneuvers &amp; Tallon Roll<br>
use them with scythe squadron TIE, they have a total of 7 (2 power, 5 maneuver).<br>
if both draw destiny and his is higher then you can also play another Dark Maneuvers &amp; Tallon<br>
but now to raise your maneuver and power by 3. so you have a total of 10+destiny!<br>
that should be enough. if not, it doesn&#146;t matter. your tallon roll (destiny 6) and your TIE (destiny 4) go back to Used Pile, thats great becuase its pretty easy to track the 6.<br>
<br>
What if opponent stacks the Tallon Roll?<br>
Be sure every good player stacks it, but its not the end of game, just battle him at the systems with the TIE interceptors, and try to force drain at the other systems and make him pay for the drains.<br>
<br>
What is with the squadrons?<br>
always to the docking bay, first to retrive 3 force second to make it easier to occupy thisbattleground site (very important), third to bring them back to your deck (opponent will battle you).<br>
<br>
You have no damage at the docking bay except if opponent plays Draw Their Fire.<br>
But I always have a smile in my face if opponent plays that, becuase thats the best of this deck. At first he will battle you. you lose a force he retrive one. it doesnt matter. next turn deploy a Tie scout. retrive a force. battle him. retrieve a force. say:&quot;you lose a force&quot;.<br>
lose your TIE.it goes to used pile. next turn the same. he will have more damage than you, because you retrieve 2 force, and lose 1 force (force drain at the bay) but he will also lose a force thats a difference of 2 for you!<br>
<br>
Okay, now you have to pay for your drains but you activate enough force to pay every drain. be sure this deck actviate enough force, sometimes i dont know what to do with my force, i swear.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
WYS: easy, cancel his drains on Tatooine, cancel his Celebration with Endor occupation, battle him at endor, retrieve force, and drain on your systems. I never lost against wys<br>
<br>
QMC: hard, try to get the system, try to get the Undercover spys out as fast as possible, cancel his celebration with EO, hold a never yalnal in hand to kill corran horn, and drain on your systems.<br>
<br>
Profit: has no good space, but the dircet damage is high, if he finds out that you play no ground. try to give him enough damage at the system and to retrive force.<br>
<br>
EBO &amp; Hidden Base: very very very hard, kill his rebel ships with tallon roll, try to shot every ship(t) in space down, make him pay for drains, and retrieve force. its a question of luck.<br>
<br>
pretty short match ups, i know, but try to play this deck always same, and you have god<br>
chance of win.<br>
<br>
thx for reading<br>
