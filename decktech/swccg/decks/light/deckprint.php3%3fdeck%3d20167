<br>
First i know begger is dead but look they use 2 shield first come here u big coward the drain and retrivel.then  the racing shield. But thats only one left they always pull the grabber or the plans shields. so begger is now tech.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok Game play keep luke in the hut until u get either some stopper card or some charater back up. U get 6 force right of the bat and with the opponent giving u know 2 to 4 icons u get epp beats down first turn to start stacking cards.<br>
<br>
With this deck i always control 2 to 3 battle grounds. It rules when they dont come to kessel and u drain for 3 each turn. <br>
<br>
Yeah the shield i almost froget<br>
<br>
wise<br>
Ultimatum<br>
onee ta<br>
He can go about his bisnass<br>
Do or do not<br>
a close race<br>
Aim High<br>
Grabber<br>
<br>
Anyways the deck is hit and run drain and just win deck<br>
<br>
I dont care for the stragety really the deck has gone a total of 15-2 in turney play <br>
<br>
<br>
Match ups<br>
<br>
Hunt down bad game for the deck the only 2 loses to the deck because i had to play some hardcore guy really good solid huntdown but it was only by 2 when i had 3 cards stack and pull a 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
Others u can deal with because u can just hit and run while ur destiny adders are built in and just draw like 2 to 3 destiny and battle while drawing above a 4 most of the time if u can track ur deck and not depend on luck.<br>
Thats why I also pack Colo Claw Fish awsome tech.<br>
<br>
<br>
While i just like to have fun with the decks i make while winning i agree that yeah epps are not as great as they once were but hell just have fun the new stuff cant handle the old school ways.<br>
<br>
Well peace <br>
I know my words are jumbled but hell thats disgrapha for yeah.<br>
If u want to rip on me d mail me or aim me<br>
