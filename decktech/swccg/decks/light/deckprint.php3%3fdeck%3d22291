Allright the first strat section was really weak I know, but the deck is really so flexible that you do very different things against different decks.  I will swap out Mejjerk for an elis helrot, I might do the restraining bolt for Look Sir droids as well.  here are some matchups.<br>
<br>
WYS: first turn search for something with crush, see whats in your force pile.  If it&#146;s sites or very useful cards, or you have no one good to deploy draw, otherwise deploy to their cantina and start draining, this is the only matchup where I won&#146;t deploy the backdoor right away, and in fact save it for when I need it, since WYS doesn&#146;t activate a great deal on its own, you can force choke it fairly effectively, or at least I have always been able to, S/A anything they play before they flip, if possible, load up the cantina and Tatooine.  Then keep your ground drains going and chase them in space, and use Maul and Vader with friends to do Drop, Kill, Repeat.  Should be a good game, but you will have an edge.<br>
<br>
QMC:  You will beat it bad, no Power Pivot, save your senses for that and to kill the evasion cards.  You  have enough space to hand on bespin, and even kick them off, and enough ground to keep a few of their sites, and at least the backdoor.  should be a fairly fun game and a definite win.<br>
<br>
HB: Rape and pillage them in space jump out to a quick lead with ground drains, and never give it back, keep probing their systems.<br>
<br>
LSC: your hardest matchup, drop 2 jedi at the same site of theirs, so if they want to come combat you they have to stay for a battle, you will only get 1 or at most 2 shots at them so beat them for all your worth.  should be a fun game, and it is winnable.<br>
<br>
all right I hope I&#146;ve given some insight into how to play this effectively, any thing I haven;t mentioned here, fortify 2 key drain sites, then beat them anywhere they are.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
okay this was originally a BHBM deck, but I decided that to use that platform wasted cards.  you start by deployiong the back door and if you have stuff you need in your force pick it up, otherwise deploy a guy if possible to the back door to start the pressure early.  then back him up and deploy all the sites you can.  this deck is very flexible, and can stand up to anything.  any specific question d-mail me otherwise.<br>
