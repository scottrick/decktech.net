<br>
i did not give myself 5 star ratings with multiple accounts.  that's really gay.  so what if somebody eats Ben's "soup?"  like ben really matters in this deck.  i also would like to point out that most of my decks are strictly meta-game choices, and they aren't meant to beat EVERYTHING.  i don't EVER play cards to stop dark side Odds decks, and if IAOrder or Decree hit the table i'll be in a serious bind either way.<br>
<br>
what the deck specifically does, is set up a HUGE drain really fast.  hopefully fast enough to mess your opponent up to the point that he'll lose some of his crucial cards.<br>
<br>
nabrun leids is not only a great offensive card, but defensive as well!  they come for the beatdown on Han?  OH!  Nabrun away.	 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
