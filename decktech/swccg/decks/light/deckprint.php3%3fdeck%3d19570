The general idea is the same, but I added some new elements to it. <br>
First, I know that Kiffex is not in here. My logic there is that with only ten starfighters, I won&#146;t be able to hold both Kiffex and Kessel, and Kessel is a better deal for me. I am trying to keep the generation the enemy gets from me to a minimum. If I get a big fight in space, I&#146;m going to concentrate on holding Sullust and Kessel and not worry about the others. <br>
Sullust is the Hidden Base because I can play Haven there, and because of the depoly +1 for the enemy. With the errata, I&#146;m excpecting them to deploy at a system (even if I occupy it), probe, and move away all in the same turn. I can stop that with Rebel Barrier and smash them good when my turn comes.   <br>
I got the idea to add Menace Fades from the HB in the expert section. It&#146;s actually a very good idea, since the forests almost garuntee that I&#146;ll always have presence there. Incidentally, that&#146;s also why I use matching pilots, so I can send some down if necessary. <br>
I dropped the Organized Attacks because I realized that I don&#146;t really need them. Everybody is immune to &lt;4 with I&#146;ll Take the Leader, and just about everyone had some immunity anyway so attrition is not a serious threat. <br>
Slight Weapons Malfunction is great because I can use it in the air or on the ground if the enemy tries to oust me from the forset. Three of my beatdown mains get a battle destiny anyway, and two can be targetted by SWM (Leia is both).   <br>
Ok, I think the rest is pretty self-explainitory. Thank you for your time.       </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
