For those of you who dont know how this works, here it goes:<br>
1st turn: get out Echo Base Garrison and the War Room.	With EBG you pull a Rouge Squadron pilot and put him in the War Room.<br>
2nd turn: get out 2 other Hoth sites and deploy another pilot<br>
3rd turn: get out EBO with a pilot or an x-wing at the Docking Bay and start launching your X-wings<br>
<br>
This deck utilitizes the best of the X-wings without S-foils, using cards such as Organized Attack and Incom Corporation.  Incom Corp. is key in my deck because it allows me to draw destiny with only 2 x-wings, not 4.  It also raises their power by one.  I havent included any drain 3 systems because I cant pull them and I dont want 0s floating around.  Use Haven at either Hoth or Yavin 4, depending on where you need it most.  Now for specific strategies against certain deck types.  Use Its A Hit to cancel opponents drains at systems you control.  The Mon Cal Cruisers and the Tantive IV are for even more power and holding the people you used to start up EBO.  Do Or Do Not is for SAC.<br>
<br>
vs. Hunt Down: Drain the heck out of them.  Use Honor Of The Jedi.  When Vader gets out, kill him.<br>
<br>
vs. ROps: Get control of their planet system fast.  Their space fleet will be no match for you.<br>
<br>
vs. Court: Watch out for their starships, especially Zuckuss In Mist Hunter.  Hopefully if they get an easy beatdown on 2 x-wings, you can deploy a bunch and beat them down.<br>
<br>
vs. D*: Tough match.  Save your ICBW and Sense for if they blow up Hoth.  I screwed a deck like this with ICBW.  I was extremely lucky that he had no Its Worse, which is the reason Its A Hit is in here.  Beat down their star destroyers and drain quickly.<br>
<br>
vs. the new D*II objective:  Put Luke in a starship as a pilot to protect him.	Shouldnt be too hard to win.  Also use Honor Of A Jedi.<br>
<br>
vs. Anything Else: Use the x-wings to drain the heck out of them and use the characters to annoy them.<br>
<br>
Thats all for now.  Please tell me what to take out as well as what to put in.<br>
Thanx!<br>

Note: I have never seen Monnok used in my area, which is why I dont have a Yarna<br>
Note: X-Wing swarm without s-foils DOES work, and quite effectively.  If I could use S-foils, It would just be icing on the cake.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
