This is a NON-REFLECTIONS III Deck.<br>
<br>
For those wondering how I got the name, its from WWF {good quality stuff, though ECW was better.... but thats because their&#8217; EXTREEEEEEEME}.<br>
<br>
Anyway on the show, Stone Cold has a talking watch. Tazz said he did too, but his was Spanish. Stone Cold&#8217;s luckily is English, I don&#8217;t know what we would do if it weren&#8217;t English! <br>
=^)<br>

<br>
This deck is STRAIGHT CHEESE. Mainly, what it does is simple. You begin with the Race and the Council. This way, you have a great starting activtion of 5 force without your oponent&#8217;s help. This is a great advantage.<br>
<br>
First of all, you win the podrace at all costs {like all LS decks}. The Step Backwards should defenitly help out with this one.<br>
<br>
After you win the race, its time to insert. Use the inserts for damage. The Mess&#8217;s help get the Inserts to the top quicker.<br>
<br>
Then, you set-up the Lar&#8217;s Moisture Farm with, of course, who else, the Lars. Here you force drain, and you retreive with the Harvests. <br>
<br>
And then of course, you always have I Did It, which is the greatest Epic Event ever.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
