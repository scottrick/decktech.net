<br>
plays like bastians(like no tracking) wys. It has a lot of my own prefrences. people wanted to see it. if u don’t know how to play it here’s a small low down.<br>
<br>
get a guy to tatione or cantina first turn.<br>
get a guy to the other locaion and flip.<br>
set up beat down while draining.<br>
beatdown.<br>
win.<br>
<br>
To beatdown do the following. get opponent to no force. get less power then them at a site, then battle. I’ve got a bad feeling about this, to double or triple it. on ground, run luke run, in space power pivot and use dash, also arto, i’ve got a bad feeling. draw ur 2-5 destiny then see ur power is greater by 10, double or triple it and win.<br>
<br>
To prevent a smack do the following. Stay flipped and use barrier, hyper escape, and dodge. remember playing stuff from lost pile is good. anyway ur power and total forfeit uslualy comes to a total of 10+ so u can’t really be smacked, and plus if they do u just smack em back for a lot more.<br>
<br>
oh yeah if you don’t understand how to play the deck then i suggest you make it and just play around with it. Then, if u still have trouble then i guess the deck is a little to complicated to play.<br>
<br>
this has lost 3 games total. <br>
once to brian twigg huntdown.<br>
once to jamie abel isb space w/ shaft.<br>
once to david irvine’s hd with 5 tramples and 7’s.<br>
one of those loses shouldn’t of happend cause i played it wrong.<br>
<br>
oh yeah here are some tough situations that u can plow through with this deck.<br>
<br>
force choked? u activate 11 force max on ur own with ur deck, thne with beggar u’ll be fine.<br>
fast damage? on the edge. battle in space then move away form them with hyper escape.<br>
visage? lose interupts.<br>
ties? beat them up, quick beatdown everywhere.<br>
isb/decree? beat them up and set up menace, this deck dose not lose drain races.<br>
<br>
any other questions just ask.<br>
