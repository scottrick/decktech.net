They Win This Round<br>

<br>
Gametext:<br>
<br>
They Win This Round:<br>
If Opponent just Force drained you at a location, deploy on that location. Opponent&#146;s force drains here are +1. Your battle destiny draws are +1. If you control this location, place Immediate Effect in used pile to retreive 4 force. {Immune to Control}.<br>
<br>
Why its Tech:<br>
With Great Warrior out, all opponent&#146;s force drain bonuses are ignored. So, when they force drain me, I drop this on their location. They get a +1 drain there, and I get a +1 destiny there. BUT... they get no force drain bonuses, so its negated, so I get a +1 destiny there, and he gets nothing. And once I control the location, I retreive 4. Sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
Text:<br>
We Didn&#146;t Hit It<br>
Deploy on table. Your force generation is +1 at systems you control. Opponent&#146;s non-unique starfighters deploy +1 (or +2 to a system you occupy). (Immune to Alter).<br>
<br>
Why Its Tech:<br>
Activating 2 for kessel is always a nice bonus. And then, if a Tie deck wants to fight, it costs them a bit more, +2 there, then you barrier them so they can&#146;t do anything. Also, its a destiny 5, so its not to bad in the deck.<br>
<br>
Text:<br>
I&#146;ve Got a Bad Feeling About This<br>
Despite your Bad Feelings, initiate at battle at a location where you have less power then the opponent. If you lose the battle, no result. If you win the battle, opponent&#146;s losses are double {if Han present, losses are trippled}.<br>
<br>
Why its Tech:<br>
Opponent leaves the Executer with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter thinking he&#146;s safe. Drop R2 in Red 5 with Luke. Drop X-Wing Lasers. Play this. Battle. Shoot and kill and make opponent lose Zuckuss. Then Power Pivot the Executor. So he has power = 0. And you have 7 power plus destiny. So, hes guranteed to lose 14 right there. <br>
<br>
<br>
How to play the deck:<br>
<br>
On opponent&#146;s turn, use Strike Planning to pull Crix Madine. Use Dagobah to deploy Training Area. Use Mind What You Have Learned to deploy Yoda. Use Training Area to pull Great Warrior. Use Great Warrior to deploy Crix Madine. Use Mind What to deploy Luke&#146;s Backpack. Have Yoda ride Crix. Next turn, you are: +7 to your training destiny. <br>
{3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1}.<br>
<br>
Then, cancel there drains. Use Projection to lower their drains even lower. Use Lost In the Wilderness to cancel their drains and place their key characters missing. Then move Yoda over to his Hut, so your attrition is -2 to you at another battle {key}. Use It Could Be Worse to cancel damage. Use They Win This Round to retreive force once you control the location. Get Kessel out through activation, and Mindful of the Future. Control Kessel with like Red Squadron 1 with Wedge in it, with X-Wing Laser Cannon, and a Power Pivot in your hand. Use the EPP Qui-Gon and EPP Luke as your attack-run {hit and run} style characters. In case the opponent plays all his shields, insert Anger, Fear, Aggression, to force him to battle you or suck 4D. {oops... sorry Raw Deal term there}.<br>
<br>
Basically.... thats the deck.<br>
