Well this is very fast deck with lots of power and a lot of force generation.<br>
<br>
You start off with Strike planning to cancel their Generation at Endor system.	Then pull General Calrissian out and use squadron assignments to get gold squadron 1 and deploy for 3 at Endor!!! next turn you get a drain of 1 in space!!<br>
<br>
Heres some explanation of cards in here:<br>
<br>
Wise Advice:  there isnt too much room for sac stuff so i threw in this helps alot even though they cancel your stuff still you dont have to lose it.<br>
<br>
A few Maneuvers:  This right here is total tech combo!!  Since the Tie Laser is a preety big thing now this really helps from getting your ships cracked.  Say if they target Gold Squadron 1 with their lasers play a few maneuvers and add 2 its maneuver after they draw weapon destiny.  Then play Darklighter Spin and draw a big Battle Destiny to hopefully clear the site and with you having high immunity dont lose anything!!<br>
<br>
Lower Corridor:  Helps get away from Your Destiny plus drain 2 site characters with sabers are power +2 with Luke Jedi there Immune &gt;7 and power 8!!! dang<br>
<br>
Tycho Celchu:  a great Spy and if with wedge can cancel a destiny.<br>
<br>
What to do against certian decks:<br>
<br>
Raltirr ops:  Try and get your first turn falcon to Ralttiir to prevent them from flipping.  Save up your force with you twix sites and drop a beatdown crew somewhere on their planet keep senses in your hand to stop their react and cause a huge force loss.<br>
<br>
BHBM:  get your first turn Gold Squad 1 out and drain.	Try to get lower corridor out and wait for him to deploy Vader and then play Luke to Lower Corridor and either sense his Elis or his Rise my friend.  Then if you have Obi and a spy in your hand and something else try to drop on emperor and kill him.. If they capture luke then try to kill vader instead of emperor.  also if they are playing a duel deck try and keep your high destinys stacked and pick your battles carefully!<br>
<br>
Tie deck:  Set up a drain at your sites.  Drop battle order and order to engage.  Get a large fleet moving from site to site making them lose from your drains and order to engage.<br>
<br>
Set your course:  envade the death star and drain there.  cause even if you die there his guys are stuck.  drain in space and try to keep away from his beatdown crew.<br>
<br>
well theres my deck try and play it sometime very fun!!</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
