<br>
I decided to take out Jedi Escape x2 and stick in another glancing blow and Run Luke, Run.  If I only changed two cards, why call it v1.1?  Why didn&#146;t I just update the original?  Because I couldn&#146;t! Decktech did not record me as the creator!? So I couldn&#146;t edit my own deck!<br>
<br>
Just to reiterate on the key points of this deck. (so you don&#146;t have to read the whole article if you don&#146;t want to)<br>
<br>
The mains in this deck are just to powerful.  But they have no immunity?  Not so fast, Jedi Test 3 subtracts 1 from battle destiny, yoda at hut subtracts 2 from attrition, changing the odds subtracts 1 from battle destiny, a step backward can move the low destiny on top of opponent&#146;s lost pile to top of reserve deck, and then there&#146;s always the trusty bacta tank.  And to make sure my mains can go where they want to go, there are 2 spies, jar-jar, and Tantive IV.<br>
<br>
Too Close For Comfort is so tech!  It cancles Podracer Collision and Hit Racer.  Many Dark Side podracing players seem to rely on interrupts instead of destiny draws.  This card cancles the podracing interrupts.  What if my opponent isn&#146;t doing podracing? Then I use it to make my opponent use 2 force to fire a weapon.  It is also great for when I play Throw Me Another Charge.  It cancles Podrace Collision if my opponent wants to place an interrupt out of play after he verified my reserve deck.<br>
<br>
This deck murders Hunt Down.  There are 3 &quot;spies&quot; (2 spies and Jar-Jar), 2 OOC &amp; TT, Honor of the Jedi, 5 characters who can put Hunt Down on 0 side, Run Luke, Run (Cancles Vader&#146;s Obsession), 2 glancing blow (cancle dueling destiny or make vader power 0), and Jedi Test 3 subtracts one from all destinies (dueling, weapon, or battle).<br>
<br>
This deck murders senate.  I give my opponent 3 icons and can revolutionize a site.  Most senate decks do not have much activation at all.  Also, there are only a few main characters.  Battle them away and you can have the whole table to yourself (except for the senate of course).<br>
<br>
This deck murders MKOS mains.  Jedi Test one cancles all the annoying bonuses from Galid or Lightsabers.  MWYHL adds 4 to sense draws.  Insurrection reduces Elis Helrot.  And, the mains can take on anyone.   <br>
<br>
This deck murders Spead Dark Deal.  Jedi Test 1 and Mains, enough said.<br>
<br>
Will I be able to win a drain race?  I only stuck in one place to drain at and nothing to pul it. And if they are doing space, I only stuck in two ships.  How can I win the drain race?! I challenge you to find a single deck that does not give you a site to drain at.  Remember, I can go anywhere and everywhere.  <br>
<br>
**********End Updates and Comments**********<br>
This deck was designed before I saw the ones on Deck Tech. So if it looks different, that is why. Also, I really need some help with this deck. My brother recently decided to only play me in Star Wars only once or twice a week and that is not good enough to make a tournament worthy deck. <br>
<br>
The idea for this was inspired by Brian Hunter&amp;#8217;s Hidden Mains. A deck with high activation from an objective he did not flip. I looked at it and thought, why not use dagobah sites because my opponent can&amp;#8217;t drain there (it&amp;#8217;s pretty hard to get on Dagobah)and it gives me pretty good activation and my opponent low activation. The first design had docking bays, but that did not really conform to my playing style so I took them out. Thus, up above is my way of playing MWYHL mains. <br>
<br>
This deck was created for defence against MKOS mains, senate, Hunt Down, and Podracing. With MKOS, many players would use lightsabers on Maul, Mara, etc. to help enhance drains. The senate has a political effect to enhance a drain. I felt the first jedi test was much more secure than Menace Fades. I also noticed alot of SAC started coming up agian. Many players just stick in the combo effect as defence. The combo merely punishes the opponent for playing SAC but it does not prevent him. MWYHL adds 4 to the destiny. This makes it much harder for the opponent to play SAC. I also noticed that it is becoming harder for the light side to accomplish an objective. The dark side now has Maul in addition to Vader, Mara, and Emporer. So I decided to make this a reactive deck. Against podracing there are two Too Close For Comfort. This prevents my opponent from messing with my race total. Often my opponent won&amp;#8217;t play Hit Racer or Podracer Collision until I would otherwise win the podrace during move phase. (Somehow I seem to win the podrace almost every time but my opponent plays Podracer Collision to removes a race destiny before move phase) This card prevents my opponent from &quot;changing the outcome&quot; of the race. It is also great during battles because most of the time players will not save 2 force for a weapon. <br>
<br>
Tantive IV? Who plays with that? I play with it because I want to be able to go anywhere. Tantive IV lets me go anywhere in space and Corran Horn, Lando w/ax, and Jar Jar can go anywhere on the ground. <br>
<br>
Why test all the way to 3? (As opposed to others who only test to one) I chose to test to #3 because of the ability to subtract one from all my opponent&amp;#8217;s destiny draws. I feel this is huge. Why not go to 4, 5, then 6? Well, I tried doing the mains out early while doing that but it did not really work out. If I want to go to test 4 or above, I need to do the training turtle kind of deck where I hide in my shell till I am done training. I believe test 4 is great with the ability to pull any card but I prefer to just go to test 3. <br>
<br>
In mid and late game this deck is a beast. Minus one from all opponents destinies (battle, weapon, etc.), minus 2 from attrition, tracking, weapon levi, changing the odds, etc. <br>
<br>
The mains are self explanatory, the Cantina is for a good drain during late game, Throw Me Another Charge is For Tracking, 2 On the Edge is for retrieval, I could go on forever... <br>
<br>
Matchups: <br>
There really is no difference in playing style. Just play smart and let them make the first move. Battle them away. Maybe you will even be able to use Watto&amp;#8217;s Box to your advantage. <br>
<br>
Tournament history: <br>
This deck is not quite the same as the one I used in at Tacticon. That one went 2-1, only losing to a senate which I should have beat. I only lost by ten which is good considering I lost the podrace when Watto&amp;#8217;s box was out. I should have won because I had a race total of 30 to his 28 but he played Podracer Collison and I was not playing Too Close for Comfort. After I lost the race, he played Limited Resource and smacked me for 4 more force lost. If I had a Too Close for Comfort I would have had not lost 15, retrieved eleven, and my opponent would lose eleven. I probably would have won the game easily. <br>
