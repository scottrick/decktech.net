OK I may as well add another thing in here since a couple of you think I should play two Barriers. If this was a dark side deck, I would. But it&#146;s not. It&#146;s light side. And light side Barriers are much weaker than dark side because dark side has Blast Door Controls, and is more likely than light to play heavy SAC. If you havent seen BDC in your area that&#146;s great; but eventually it&#146;ll show up and you have two red cards in your deck that are totally useless to you.<br>
***End update #2***<br>

*****Update*****<br>
Let me give you a little help here. The EPPs are for suicide runs only. They&#8217;re NOT going to get dueled. I&#8217;m NOT going to leave them at a site so I DON&#8217;t need any versions with immunity. And I play 3 because of the suicidal nature they are in there for. And this deck seriously beats MKOS and Court every time. The only time this deck has lost to those is when I used to play spies instead of EPPs. But EPPs are so much better.<br>
Imagine (this has actually happened, btw, against a 1750 player): Baby Jabba, Pote Snitkin and a Skrilling at the Audience Chamber. I drop Luke (for 7 with No Bargain), Draw Their Fire, battle. My opponent has no force saved so he can&#8217;t play any goofy interrupts. I swing and hit Jabba and draw an easy tracked 5 for BD. He has to lose Jabba first (he was hit) which removes his forfeit modifier for the Skrilling and means he has to lose the other two guys as well (5 in attrition). All I lose is Luke. Luke CLEARS THE SITE against 3 guys. Court&#8217;s the same, with all the low ability, low forfeit bounty hunters, they get creamed by suicidal EPPs. Take my word for it.<br>
Finally thanks for the suggestion about Tunnel Visions, but with searching your deck every turn through HB you can find any card you want within the first four turns of the game. It&#8217;s called planning ahead.<br>
***End update***<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I&#8217;ve been playing this deck for a while now and it&#8217;s done me well, winning me a couple tournaments and giving me wins with huge differential (quite a feat for light side decks nowadays). I&#8217;m retiring it because everyone in my meta has played it, been crushed by it, then figured it out. Plus with the new light side objective rumored to be a Kessel Run objective I think people may start packing Oota Goota Solo as meta. In any case this deck is old to me. But maybe you will find it new and refreshing.<br>
<br>
Here&#8217;s how the deck works:<br>
Turn 1:  Get Billy Dee out of the deck during the opponent&#8217;s turn. Activate at least three and pull Endor (opponent gets no force there) and throw Billy down in his ship.<br>
Turn 2: Activate at least five and pull Aquaris. Pull some other guy (depends on who you draw) and deploy him to Aquaris. Move Lando over to Aquaris and you will now be generating 9 force by yourself while giving the opponent only one.<br>
<br>
The only time you will variate from this strategy is when you are playing a BHBM deck that activates 9+ on its second turn and can potentially drop Zuckuss or Fett on your Mini-Falcon and cause early problems. You do not want to lose the Mini-Falcon.<br>
<br>
From there on in you will continue to get a system and a guy each turn, usually drawing leftover cards. Stack all of your guys at Aquaris. You need the activation there. When I first began playing this deck I would spread in space in the early game to drain - I found my best opponents would drop guys at Aquaris to cut my activation there, and it hindered me greatly. The opponent will not go to Aquaris when you have Lando, Wedge and Tycho all in their matching ships there.<br>
<br>
Eventually the drains of one a turn will get through to the opponent. If he comes to fight you he will lose. Barrier/Hyper Escape then beatdown. Chase him around with Order To Engage. Get out Legendary (not always though, as I will discuss later on).<br>
<br>
The opponent will most likely be damaging you on the ground. This is what the Kessel Runs are for. You should begin looking for them and the Funk Captains from the beginning of the game so you have them ready when you need them. You can pull off the one-turn Kessel Run with the YT-1300, but usually it is best to wait and just fly the Falcon there and back.<br>
<br>
This is also what the Draw Their Fire and EPPs are for. Drop Luke, battle, 2 force swing. Kill a couple guys (the destiny in this deck is decent) and repeat.<br>
<br>
Eventually you will wither your opponent&#8217;s life force down to nothing while maintaining your own through Kessel Runs and EPPs. This is when you flip. When the opponent has less than five cards left in his life force, you flip (and be sure Battle Plan is out). Now he cannot draw up. Drain him below three cards and let him stew while you retrieve your entire lost pile with the Kessel Runs. Use Tibrin to recirculate any excess cards in hand into your lost pile and subsequently into your life force.<br>
<br>
This does not happen every game - sometimes you deploy Legendary early and your opponent can simply lose to that from life force to end the game. Sometimes the opponent has Search and Destroy, Visage, or Ability x3 in effect and you are unable to deal with them. In these cases, you ought to just take the best win you can get. But many times you will be able to retrieve your entire lost pile.<br>
<br>
About certain cards:<br>
Darklighter Spin/Punch It!<br>
You basically start with the Falcon, these interrupts enhance it. Half the time there is a Funk Captain on the Falcon with Billy Dee, together they make it maneuver 7 so Darklighter Spin is huge. And Punch It! is absolutely an awesome card.<br>
<br>
X-Wing Cannon<br>
Helps against BHer ships and TIEs.<br>
<br>
Ultimatum<br>
For rogue insert and (especially) EV9D9 decks.<br>
<br>
Secret Plans can bite it. The deck generates plenty of force to deal with that. If you play it well you will be able to save up for it when you need it.<br>
<br>
Here&#8217;s specifics for DS decktypes:<br>
<br>
BHBM<br>
Don&#8217;t deploy Lando early, it&#8217;s too risky. Save the force you would use to deploy him however so you can get two guys out turn two. Be wary of the Lateral Damage and find a grabber ASAP to deal with the SAC. Give them Luke right away to start the damage. Drain them in space, they WILL come to fight you because that&#8217;s what their objective does. You will win when they fight you, deploy Legendary if you want or just drain them down to nothing and retrieve all your stuff. Easy.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down<br>
Take out Visage with the Terminateds and Search and Destroy with the EPPs. They will be left to draining as their only damage and you can handle that. If they come to space they will be beaten worse than BHBM. Stick to the gameplan and you&#8217;ll win.<br>
<br>
Court/MKOS<br>
They both play with a bunch of scrubs, whom can easily be beaten with the EPPs. They&#8217;ll also only be playing 3 or 4 ships so space should be a breeze. Make it a point to initiate as many battles as you can so they cannot use their Scum and V to it&#8217;s fullest. Use their First Strike against them.<br>
<br>
TIEs<br>
TIE cannons are your worst nightmare. You must be cautious. Take over Milwaukee (Tycho or Blunt will give you access so you dont have to pay the extra movement) and impose Battle Plan on them (get an EPP to the DS Docking Bay fast so Palpy cant get there) and they will be force choked.<br>
<br>
Manip<br>
Squad Assignments saves you from Miyoom and SCrew. I&#8217;ve played and beaten well-constructed, well-played manip decks and I don&#8217;t think any more anti-manip is needed.<br>
<br>
Anything else: Stick to the game plan and you&#8217;ll do well.<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy this deck as much as I have.	</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
