<br>
Please read the strategy before reviewing, thanks, it&#146;ll explain a lot.<br>
<br>
I made this deck because I wanted something nobody would expect. My DS deck is strong, as are most DS decks these days. My DS isn&#146;t a problem. However, my LS decks had been experiencing problems with all these strong DS decks running around. So I needed to make a deck that was decently good, original, fun, and most of all, unexpected. I fiddled with YOps for a while, with some success. But people soon learned that when they played me all they had to do was start with No Escape and Secret Plans and they&#146;d win. So I made this deck. I haven&#146;t played with it much so I can&#146;t give much indication of how good it is, but keep in mind I&#146;m not building it to win worlds. It&#146;s just a fun deck that might win some games. Don&#146;t give me one star, saying &quot;so-and-so will kill you.&quot; I am perfectly aware that the deck has weaknesses, as all decks do, thanks.<br>
<br>
You start the Rebel Landing Site. Why? Tech and surprise factor. The opponent isn&#146;t sure what to think when you start with this site... hopefully they&#146;ll think you&#146;re a newbie scrub with some kind of weird Endor Ewok deck. If they think that, all the better. The tech comes in the text: &quot;Your starfighters land here for free. Your droids and Endor icon Rebels are deploy -1 here.&quot; We&#146;re just looking at the droids deploy -1 part. This rocks. Even if the opponent gives you no Force, you can deploy droids here for free, Artoo&#146;s only for 3. This gives you less of a need for massive activation, while giving you 2 Force anyway, while only giving the opponent one. If you haven&#146;t already guessed, the deck is a numbers/speeders deck. Your first turn will be most important.<br>
<br>
First turn, deploy the Endor: Docking Bay from Reserve Deck. Deploy at least one R2-X2 there, deploy the rest at the Landing Site for free. Insert NTMTO if you have it. Then use HDWGITM (with your droid at a scomp link at the docking bay), hopefully drawing an R2-X2 or 2. You want to get 3 out first turn with numbers inserted in the opponent&#146;s deck. This will happen most of the time, with all the Messes and droids in the deck. Without enough R2-X2s, you can settle for ASP-707s, they&#146;re only one less destiny. But let&#146;s say you get out 3 R2-X2s and insert Odds... and let&#146;s say the opponent didn&#146;t deploy any characters on their turn (they shouldn&#146;t have)... if numbers pops up, opponent loses 12 Force. Even if they deploy 3 destiny 3 characters, when it pops they lose 3. 3 destiny 2 characters (about average), that&#146;s 6 Force lost. 3 destiny 1 characters (not uncommon, especially mid- to late-game) they lose 9 Force. You get the idea... lots of Force loss.<br>
<br>
On your second turn, deploy the Hoth: Echo Docking Bay. On the first turn, your goal was to get 3 droids out and insert numbers. On this turn, you want to get Maneuvering Flaps and Incom Corporation out. Not too hard, trust me. Even if you don&#146;t do it this turn, 3rd turn is fine. The point is, your speeders will be your opponent&#146;s nightmare. Numbers will do damage, yeah, but the speeders handle your drains, and can end the game in one big battle. Even if it isn&#146;t one battle, you&#146;ll likely be battling the opponent with the speeders for plenty of Force loss if you play it right. The ASP droids are key here... deploy one to the site and all the speeders (power +3, +4 with Attack Pattern Delta) deploy -1. So the Rebel Snowspeeders deploy for free, the other for just one Force. You don&#146;t need much Force for this deck. With 10 Force, you can deploy 1 ASP droid, 8+ speeders, and battle, each of the speeders power 5-8. 9 power 6 speeders = you win.<br>
<br>
The Back Door rocks. It has a scomp link for Mess, it gives you 2 Force, and you can drain the opponent for 2 there. With this and the other 2 Endor sites controlled by speeders, you can use T-47 Battle formation to make the drains +1, that&#146;s a drain of 7, not bad. Even with the Interrupt, those sites provide a solid unmodified drain of 4. Card details:<br>
<br>
Ounee Ta: This card can be a game-winner if used right. Versus Ops, start with it, and wreck the opponent on their planet. Otherwise, use it to retrieve your top lost card into hand. This can be killer, depending on what you retrieve. T-47 Battle Formation is good to retrieve. In the late game, if you&#146;re running low on inserts, retrieve one into hand. If you just lost a key card from top of Reserve, retrieve it into hand.<br>
<br>
Nar Shaadaa Wind Chimes: The retrieval portion of this cards text works with non-unique droids, not just non-unique aliens. Don&#146;t use it until you have at least 6 R2-X2s on table. If you get 8 out, use it. Or you can use it earlier, if you just lose something valuable. Using this to retrieve 6-8 Force really helps.<br>
<br>
How Did We Get Into This Mess?: This card allows you to continually cycle through your deck, while you get and deploy anything you want. For you trackaholics out there, this is a trackers dream. The card itself is a 4, and you can stack multiple destinies under it.<br>
<br>
ASP-707: Don&#146;t forget to stack speeders on your deck in the late game to increase differential. Putting cards back into your deck from table is great, with 4 of these guys on table that&#146;s 4 cards every turn.<br>
<br>
Jeroen Webb: What is this guy for? First, he&#146;s a spy. This lets him cancel Visage. Considering how fast you can get him into hand, Visage won&#146;t be too much of a problem, just hope your opponent doesn&#146;t deploy another one quick. When you deploy him to cancel Visage, be sure to give him some droid backup. The R2 droids are power 1 forfeit 3, the ASP droids power 0 forfeit 4. Jeroen is power 1, forfeit 6 (Insurrection). Let&#146;s say you deploy Jeroen, an ASP droid, and an R2 droid. This is power 3 + forfeit 13 = 16. Your opponent&#146;s power will have to be 17 or higher to make you lose any Force. If it&#146;s less, just forfeit Jeroen and leave the droids, which can&#146;t be battled. But Jeroen isn&#146;t just for Huntdown. Being a good pilot, he can pilot a speeder to add 2 to it&#146;s power, and his forfeit of 6 makes him perfect forfeit fodder. Another role he&#146;s good for is deploying to an opponent&#146;s docking bay where your opponent thinks he&#146;s safe... deploy Jeroen, follow up with some speeders, battle. Problem solved. Be creative in finding ways to use him. He&#146;s been in my deck for 3 years, and will never come out.<br>
<br>
Houjix: In case they kill Jeroen. It also has a less obvious use that can really come in handy, it cancels Sunsdown &amp; Too Cold For Speeders. This card makes your speeders power 0. Not anymore, just cancel the Effect with this card. Also good for anytime you spread thin and your opponent makes you pay for it. Or so he thinks.<br>
<br>
T-47 Battle Formation: Going into a game you have 2 options as to how you&#146;ll play your deck, depending on the matchup (more on this later). You can either spread on Endor with the speeders and drain for a lot, using this card one, two, or 3 times, or you can use the speeders for battling. Or you can do both, which is definitely possible. In the matchups, when I say option, I&#146;m referring to whether to spread with the speeders, battle with the speeders, or both with the speeders.<br>
<br>
Artoo: Has a couple good uses. He lets you draw one more card with Mess, which can be a couple to a few cards with consecutive Messes. It can make a big difference, especially if those extra cards are speeders. Artoo is also destiny 6, and deploy for only 3 at the Rebel Landing Site. If you get a god hand with Artoo, 2 R2-X2s, and NTMTO, you can deploy all the droids to the Landing Site and insert odds even if the opponent doesn&#146;t give you any Force. That&#146;s 14 Force lost for the opponent if they haven&#146;t deployed any characters when it pops up.<br>
<br>
I know there&#146;s not much retrieval, but the retrieval that&#146;s there makes a big difference. Before or during a game, you can choose a Lost Interrupt and abuse it (use it 3 times). With Ounee Ta you can take it back into hand, and Chimes let&#146;s you retrieve it, and you can get it back quickly with the Messes. The card you choose to abuse depends on the matchup. The cards to abuse are Houjix, Grimtaash, T-47 Battle Formation, and Attack Pattern Delta. In the matchups I&#146;ll tell you which one to abuse.<br>
<br>
I prefer different speeders as to all the same for a number of reasons. One, less susceptible to Monnok. Two, the Rebel speeders deploy for less and are destiny higher, but the others are more powerful and forfeit for more. The Sandspeeders can provide an interesting surprise versus a Tatooine deck. It tricky, but if you do it right, you can have 3 Sandspeeders flying around as reacts. Provides nice surprise for the opponent. But remember, Flaps makes the speeders landspeed =0 when activated, so to get the reacts to work you&#146;ll have to ignore Flaps. This may sound like your leaving your speeders more vulnerable, but really you&#146;re not, because you have the Sandspeeders as backup reacts. If the opponent thinks your vulnerable, good, he&#146;ll battle, then you can move the Sandspeeders as a react. Matchups:<br>
<br>
MKOS, CCT, Court:<br>
Option: Battle, you can&#146;t afford to spread and drain, you&#146;re gonna need all the power you can get on Tatooine.<br>
Abuse: If you suspect a swarm (MKOS Abyssins), abuse Grimtaash.<br>
Versus Court and CCT abuse Attack Pattern Delta for more power.<br>
Basically you want to battle them on Tatooine all you can at the exterior sites. Worried about the interior drains? Don&#146;t worry. Your numbers damage should be more than their drain damage. If they choose to keep Jabba, Bib, and Gailid safe, that&#146;s only a destiny total of 4. Another destiny 1 character and it&#146;s only a 3. Numbers will be dealing lots of damage every turn, while your speeders either wreck them at the exterior sites, or drain at the exterior sites. Go to Tatooine and take over. If they&#146;re playing all interior sites, then get your drains on Endor set up. That plus all the Numbers damage should clench the victory.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down:<br>
Option: Drain, your drains will be more than theirs, and if they come to Endor (which they will), then battle them to reclaim your drains.<br>
Abuse: T-47 Battle Formation, definitely. The opponent should be dead by the time you use this 3 times.<br>
You want to get Visage canceled early with Jeroen and some droid backup. Set up your drains as fast as you can, remember, Incom gives those speeders ability 2 pilots so just 2 can hold a site with a destiny draw. Numbers will be doing lots of damage, Vader and his cronies tend to have low destiny. Sure the opponent may not let you use T-47 Battle Formation, but the fear of it will keep him in check, and besides, if he comes to Endor, battle him. A lot.<br>
<br>
BHBM:<br>
Option: Drain, but you may need to do both depending on the type of BHBM. Whatever you do, drain for as much as you can.<br>
Abuse: T-47 Battle Formation. If they won&#146;t let you spread on Endor, you need to abuse Houjix.<br>
Your worst matchup. You have no Luke in the deck (add one in if you want, the deck is flexible, Jedi Luke would be nice &#146;cuz he deploys less on Endor and he&#146;s destiny 6 for Odds... hey, not a bad idea...) and the Emperor is destiny 6. If your opponent starts making you lose Force from your own inserts, you&#146;re screwed. Hang in there, try to spread, and keep Nubers going, hopefully they&#146;ll get the low destiny characters out. Not impossible to win, but tough.<br>
<br>
RallOps, Ops:<br>
Option: Battle! With Ounee Ta you can absolutely slaughter them...<br>
Abuse: Attack Pattern Delta, kill them!<br>
Start Ounee Ta instead of Aim High. Your characters and speeders deploy -3 on their planet. ASP deploys for free, then the speeders deploy -4. ASP-707 becomes pretty much pointless, he&#146;s just good for stacking the speeders back in your Life Force in the late game to increase differential. Just go to their planet and battle, battle, battle. Odds will do damage, but your speeders should be doing more.<br>
<br>
TIEs:<br>
Option: Drain! Get your big drains going before they realize you have no ships!<br>
Abuse: T-47 Battle Formation, drain as much as you can.<br>
They don&#146;t have much in the way of characters, which is great for Odds, they&#146;ll be losing lots to that. However, they&#146;ll have big space drains going. You don&#146;t need to out-drain them since Odds will be doing so much damage, but since there won&#146;t be much interaction, drain all you can, the drains will help a lot.<br>
<br>
If they start Resistance or YCHF, it isn&#146;t the end of the world. Your Odds are screwed, which is bad, don&#146;t get me wrong, but you still have your speeders. IF they start YCHF, hope that they ditch it for something before they realize your playing Numbers. If they start Resistance, remember to occupy a battleground with speeders, then do as much Odds damage as you can before they occupy 3 battlegrounds. See, YCHF and Resistance don&#146;t completely screw you, they just make it a lot harder.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading. The deck is flexible, you can do it different ways if you want. I haven&#146;t played with it much, so I realize it still needs work. Making it a TIGIH deck? Add in Draw Their Fire? Lots of good options. I&#146;m open for any suggestions, tips, or anything, thanks,<br>
