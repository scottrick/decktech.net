<br>
First with the podrace:<br>
<br>
Losing Track and Too Close For Comfort should help deal with Podracer Collision.  And A Step Backwards should help deal with Sebulba&#146;s head start.  Unless they&#146;re completely dedicated to racing then u should have a pretty good shot at winning the race.<br>
<br>
Now on to the rest of the deck.  First turn pull Quiggy with saber with the city outskirts and move him over to the junkyard.  start draining to accululate cards on Credits Will Do Fine.  Don&#146;t deploy ur senators until the objective gets flipped because they might die, or dont deploy them after you&#146;ve won the podrace (if its before you&#146;ve flipped) because itll be easier to retrieve them with the podrace win.  Try to get the Queen&#146;s Ship to the tatooine system ASAP with Ric piloting.  Give it some backup with some Naboo Fighters and the Radiant VII with Madakor.  Use Padme before the flip to get Obi-wan and Qui-gon out should he die and try to get the council members out quickly as well.  Once you flip you should be in good condition, if you&#146;ve won the race then I Did It! should be doing its thing as well as the flip side of the objective.  If its a close game then gather a group of people and just battle like crazy so you can retrieve some force and hopefully you&#146;ll win the battle.  You should be able to control space easily as DS Ep. 1 decks dont run too much space as I&#146;ve seen.  I know this aint the best strategy but this deck is pretty basic and shouldn&#146;t be too hard to figure out so thanx for looking.<br>
