Strategy:<br>
Pull the remaining DS site and all three gunners; that should be enough to blow Alderaan. Do it asap.<br>
<br>
This deck is very straightforward. Pull the systems, deploy your spaceships. This deck is not about timing, its not about a beatdown. Just deploy whatever youve got. This also lessens the effect of cards targetting your hand.<br>
<br>
Your Twileks will get the effects out fast, and theyre protected.<br>
<br>
The sword and shield are primarily intended to have a way out to deploy your squadrons, if the Atmospherics get canceled. But always try to deploy a SD after a squadron so you get your Atmospheric back.<br>
<br>
You dont have to worry about getting drained on the ground. This deck retreives like mad. Slam a SD, retreive 3. Add a squadron, retreive another 3! I usually end up having NO cards in my lost pile. And with a drain of 15+ going in space, your opponents pile will get very fat, very fast.<br>
<br>
For the match-ups:<br>
A lot of decks rely on a beatdown on the ground. But you dont have any targets for them, so thats a lot of wasted cards.<br>
Only EBO and Senators/space have a remote chance of battling this one. But you will have a lot more power.<br>
And did I mention you will be able to retreive with everything you deploy ?<br>
<br>
Changes:<br>
Ive tried this deck with some spies to cancel the grounddrains, but found it unnecessary.<br>
Feel free to use other battleground systems if they suit you better. <br>
I guess its not relevant wich SDs you use, as long as theyre unique. Immunity to atrition is always a good idea.<br>
Mb you want to add a Dreadnought or two, to add some power to your Ties.<br>
You can also change the interrupt-mix, depending on your local meta.<br>
