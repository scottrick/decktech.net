 strategy as the last ones, so read it. espically the bottom..	  Basically, use twi lek to start biker scout gear in the beginning. Get down a trooper each turn with Ral Ops,(after getting 2 sites down), and get a bike down for them that turn too. Once you get enough guys down, pull another site, and flip the OBJ. Continue to control the ralltiir sites to add to your Battle Destinies. Use the ability to use 2 force to bring things into hand, and get systems, and the ships, namely fett in ship and bossk in bus. Use epp vader (and vaders cape, higher destiny than vader+saber) and mara( and saber) to get some nice hits with forfiet =0, since you are almost guarenteed to hit with the high destinies (25 cards with a 5,6, or 7, 32 cards when you control raithal!) , then add to your destiny with the OBJ's game text. If you only got one destiny, you could draw a 7 (very possible) and get it to be +4 because you control all 4 ralltiir sites, for a BD of 11! Use dengar to get you two forfiet = 0 hits during each battle! cant beat that! before you let mara,vader and dengar loose, play 3,720 to 1, and butcher them, since all your troopers are destiny 5 when you control raithal. Compared to a likely 3 for a total of theirs, and 15 of yours, they loose 12 force, not to shabby. Once that is done, drop mara, vader and dengar, and kill them.  Check out my earlier variations of this deck BEFORE you rate this one, as once you see those, this one will be a 4 star deck! (i wish...)<br>
<br>
Reasons for the cards:<br>
I like furry fury and scruffy looking nerf herder since they:<br>
A) cancel destiny adders, or<br>
B) let you draw destiny, and subtract from oppenent..a good idea with such high destinies!<br>
<br>
Visage because:<br>
A) a destiny of 7<br>
B) good incase they are packing a holoboard<br>
<br>
Dengar rocks because:<br>
A) he can get two hits (easily with the high destinies, and they are +1), that are each forfiet = 0.<br>
<br>
Nevar Yalnal is better than hutt smooch because:<br>
A) has a better destiny, and it is a destiny deck... (has a 6, instead of a 2)<br>
B) makes them lost, instead of captured, so they cant get back on the other side, unless the retrieve.<br>
<br>
Endor Occupation is cool:<br>
A) cancels the celebrations. always good<br>
<br>
It's Worse:<br>
A) when they play it could be worse, it is over for them<br>
B) often is not expected<br>
C) if they cancel it, they lose force to there is no try, and it is placed in used pile instead of lost<br>
<br>
Vaders Eye:<br>
A) Good with vader, to get suicides to be even more effective<br>
B) good with mara too<br>
<br>
Empires New Order:<br>
A) retrieves force, so you can forfiet, and retrieve em<br>
<br>
Vaders Cape and EPP Vader:<br>
A) higher destiny, with only one less forfeit<br>
<br>
Boring Convo Anyways:<br>
A) Cancels lots of destiny adders, as well as other pesky cards<br>
<br>
Problems and Weaknesses:<br>
ultimatum will stop 3,720 to 1 dead in its tracks, so i only put one in (i also only have one..lol)<br>
Rescue the Princess could be a problem...<br>
Spy decks, but i dont think too many are used, and Nevar Yalnal fixes them right up, espically boushh and tk-422.<br>
Throne Room Mains---ahhh!<br>
<br>
As you can see, i have good reasons for my cards. I want to include a monnok, what should i take out, with out lowering the destiny too much, i was thinking 3,270 to 1, because of ultimatum, but then some people on decktech would shoot me. You all think my activation sucks, but i played a game over the net, and i got 9 compared to his 10, not that bad, seeing as my characters (other than vader and mara) are pretty much low deploy. i can see it getting beat in a throne room mains, just by under activation. YES, I AM OBSESSED WITH HIGH DESTINIES, deal with it. I only play against one guy, EVER, and this will kick his ass, and more. I just love getting ultra high destinies....I added the cards to make SAC hurt. I am thinking about taking out Empires New Order, as i have too many aliens (mara, dengar, the ships) that i rely on, that will keep me from playing it, maybe i should switch it with a secret plans? For my starting, i should probably do surface defense and start all three of those (throw those cards in, of course), instead of twi lek and biker scout gear. I added main course as it stops frozen assets, and that can be a REAL pain. I should get rid of mournful roar and closed door, but i dont know for what, gimme some ideas (preferably destiny 6, or 5). i also need some retrieval, help me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am looking for some constructive advice here, not &quot;that sucks&quot;, or &quot;free points&quot; with half a star given. This deck is atleast 3.5 stars... in my opinion anyways...you probably think you could wipe your ass with it and it is no better than that :-)</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
