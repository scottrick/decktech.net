<br>
Card Choices: <br>
<br>
Fear/Limited Resources: I found that four force randomly can be quite a shock, and Fear helps me get their hand down to 2 cards or less.<br>
<br>
Meteor Impact/Destroyed Homestead: I found that this can be one of the deadliest combos there is. Target Luke w/Destroyed Homestead and Meteor Impact on one end of the Tatooine sites and the other. Sit Palpy, Janus, and Sim w/a force lighting and I have u now at the impact site and drain and watch them lose a force each turn and Luke can&#146;t draw destiny.<br>
<br>
Early Game: Start racing and get the Brangus/Podracer collision engine w/Gardulla retrieving the DB each turn combo set up early, and get a draining character or two to a drain site early to start draining. Start Onithing the pepl from his hand to keep your pepl safe. <br>
<br>
Mid-Game: You should have won the race by now and you should be ready to hold out for the win. Start setting up your drains and combos. They should be low on characters because of Onith, and you should be strong on life force. <br>
<br>
End-Game: Be ready for some big attacks because they are in a hole. You should have gotten Crush out by now and get an I Have You Now and also get you are beaten. If you can hold of any big damage from attacks, you should coast along to the win.<br>
<br>
This deck might have trouble vs. ebo or hb because of the drains that you cannot stop, but the 11 retrieval from the podrace and one every turn from Gardulla who is set up by Sim, should be enough to keep you going on to a very close win. Profit Podracing might give you fits, but keep the damage steady and Onith keeping their beatdown characters away early so you can set up your drains. <br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed reading this deck and I hope you enjoy playing it when Coruscant comes out.<br>
