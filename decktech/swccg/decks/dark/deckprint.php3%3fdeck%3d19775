Use your big pile of mains and ships<br>
to rule over ground and space. All the sites are exterior so your combat vehicles are<br>
usefull. You get all sites from reserve and systems come in time or with Merrejk.<br>
Activation is no problem with locations from reserve and mobilization points(even if they get suspendet). <br>
<br>
You should be able to crush all the resistance with the awesome potential of your warmachine.<br>
Battle deployment really will make Cloud City yours, because of their destiny limit. Remember<br>
to put Lando in to vehicle or ship! Character base is powerfull and gets multiple<br>
battle destinies easily. Free Executor(granted by They Must never again leave this city) is yours to command and pretty fast with 2xWMAOP! Use Guri in space to stop destiny storms!<br>
<br>
This deck is a lot more versatile than the flipping version. You dont have to set up all day. Still you can get heavy drains and some DD.<br>
So you can react against your opponent! First Strike backs your aggressive strategy, and four barriers ensure that you`ll do the attacks(and retrieval)!<br>
<br>
Here come the matchups:<br>
<br>
MWYHL: Use CC-occupation to deal damage.Drain heavily and battle. <br>
<br>
EBO: Fight in space, rule the ground and drain. Walkers can storm Hoth if necessary. Resistance will help.<br>
<br>
WYS: Take space, use Guri there if necessary. Grap their key interrupt. Conguer ground, stay in your city.<br>
drain them to pieces!	<br>
 <br>
RTP: Rule space, fight in ground. Try cancel bacta tank and kill the princess(many times).<br>
&quot;Shut him up or shut him down&quot; will be their death.<br>
<br>
QMC: Take space and win, because of battle order making them pay. So A LOT OF FORCE THERE!<br>
<br>
Mains: Battle and drain. Keep the iniative.<br>
<br>
Agents in court: Start Battle order. Aliens and droids can strike them. <br>
Walkers can attack to sandstormed sites. Drain race them to grave!<br>
<br>
Hyper generator ist kaput: Take space, fight at ground and finally win!<br>
<br>
We`ll handle this: Resistance and Battle order will do the job for you. Dont send your dark jedi to Naboo(unless pretty high tracked destinies or heavy back up by other guys or AT-AT:s)<br>
<br>
HP: Your fleet is enough to create a threat or crush them. No Problemo man!<br>
<br>
Thats all folks!
