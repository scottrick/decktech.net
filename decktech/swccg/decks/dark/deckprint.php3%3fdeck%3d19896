Someone asked to list the Destiny 7&#146;s.  I mention they are useless because I don&#146;t want to play them, I just want to reactor terminal them.  the only one that is remotely useful is The Phantom Menace - but it will get cancelled most of the time.  I used a mixture of Visage, Intruder Missles, Imperial Artillery, We&#146;re the Bait, and Closed Door.  I would try and even it out as best as possible to avoid a lost grimtaash :) see Info Broker&#146;s comment.<br>

The basic premise is to use sith fury for a whopping 9 force loss from a duel, since you will always win the duel.  However, the deck is much deeper than that. Here are the three ways to win the game.<br>
<br>
1) They give you luke and you sith fury them 4 times for 36 force loss.  Along with the regular duel for 3 force, you will easily win the game.  Its not hard to draw the sith fury because you draw a huge hand and reactor terminal everything else...oh yeah if you ever lose the duel shame on you. Don’t think this can happen? Ask Efridge and Justin Desai...this game will be fast and ugly.<br>
<br>
2) You put down vader ASAP to the naboo docking bay, they drop luke to a &#148;safe&#148; site to avoid your destiny.  Down comes EPP maul with I have you now...luke and 18 please.  This is the perfect scenario for EBO. If they don’t put luke down, you bend over cuz you are going to get hurt bad. This is what I should have done to Brian Hunter’s WYS. I choked and forgot to activate my one extra for the spaceport docking bay, and didn’t do this...DAMN! It still pisses me off.<br>
<br>
3) They give you EPP luke and you make sure to win 2 battles. Stack two force, send a 1,1,7 to the bottom of you reserve deck.  You lose the dual...but win the game.  This is the strategy to use for lightsaber combat.  I played Tim Guzman and messed up trying to combat him, but his two 7’s beat my two 7’s because he had qui-gon’s new stick. Also, I changed from the cloud city DB to the naboo DB, so you could capture Qui-gon and get out of dodge.<br>
<br>
Pleas respond with any questions...this deck is awesome.  I highly recommend if you play this, don’t try and replace any of the &#148;useless&#148; 7’s with useful 6’s...you NEED the 7’s to win sith fury.<br>

Mad props to Corey Faherty and for desinging and helping put this deck together<br>
