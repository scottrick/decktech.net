I doubt it I would take this to my next tournament, but it may have a shot. Choose your starting wisely and dont forget to take advantage of the Combat Readiness. I usually start with Tatooine/Jabbas Palace and then pull Audience chamber on your first turn, but you may want to change this(Dont know why you would, but whatever). I have found that this deck gets characters on the table fairly quickly and shouldn't have a problem holding down sites. There is 2 evaders just in case Mr.Revolution rears his ugly head in. If you are playing Hidden Base, it might be wise to start with Security Precautions. This deck can probably be able to hold Tatooine and still have people left over to chase your opponent to other planets without a problem. Ephant Mon is pretty useful for keeping spies out of an important site(*cough* Boussh). Twi'lek for Tatooine Occupation ASAP because that will probably be what does the most damage. If your playing a profit deck, it might be wise to grab Secret Plans if you get the chance. The amout of ships in this deck is small because I don't see many where I play, but you can certainly remove some of the characters and throw in some more DS Star Destroyers or what not. Pol Treidum is great for taking out spies too. Most of this deck is pretty self-explanatory. And yes, I know cantina isn't in there, because I don't like giving the opponent that much force, but If you wanna throw it in there, you can probably make room.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
