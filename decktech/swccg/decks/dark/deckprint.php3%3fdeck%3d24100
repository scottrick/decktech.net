------------------------------<br>
Brangus: You’re the type of person that doesn’t need to be rating/reviewing decks.  Not that I’d call that a review.  I really don’t mind the 1/2 star, but please give a good reason for it.  And read the strat please.<br>
<br>
Thank you CGogolen, for a review consisting of more than one sentence, and being honest.  Yes, Alter is one of the cards that hurt this deck, but I don’t see TOO much of it in my area.  Also, I can still get in some respectable drains with all systems except fondor draining for 2, with chiraneau that increases more.  The ground is something I’ve been thinking about; probably will change.  Thank you for your opinions.<br>
<br>
Mighty_maul: the start is actually pretty logical if you THINK about it... Mob points for Executor and activation, Oppressive enforcement not only protects from S&A but helps out my destiny as well, and SSPFT helps cool down retrieval and helps beatdowns.  <br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Alright, for those of you who haven’t seen it, flip SYC is simply too slow to compete right now.  With this deck, you can have several systems occupied and FWKTIL operating at parsec 4 or 5 by the time you could have blown up Alderaan with the alternative.<br>
<br>
DESTINY LAYOUT(without starting cards):<br>
0:6<br>
1:13<br>
2:3<br>
3:6<br>
4:11<br>
5:2<br>
6:6<br>
7:0<br>
AVERAGE: 2.49<br>
Plz note that all interrupts are used interrupts(except flawless marks) and all locations are pulled quickly.  Most of the 1s are destroyers and admirals which are also pulled. <br>
<br>
First Turn<br>
1.Pull Executor<br>
2.Pull D* war room and check for piet/merrejk while in there.  <br>
3.either pull piet&merrejk via imp command or deploy them from hand, if you don’t get either somethings wrong with your shuffling..err.. actually just draw them up...<br>
4.pull any system exept Fondor (we wouldn’t want someone to make executor un deployable, would we?)<br>
<br>
Second Turn<br>
1. deploy fondor if you have 10 force available and drop executor, preferably with a pilot... ozzel is a good one.<br>
2. move executor to a better drain system<br>
<br>
the rest of the game is spent deploying SD’s, pilots, and draining.  Continuously move up the D* to at least parsec 5 to let FWKTIL cover all of your systems.<br>
<br>
The tractor beams are what give you the punch you need to control space.  With in range, you get a +2 draw during the weapons phase.  Flawless marks. adds 4 more, and our first COTD adds 2 more.  That’s 8 for all you math experts out there.  Lennox is tractor beam sniper, shooting during the control phase.  most lightside starships won’t have a maneuver of more than 4 or 5, with a few exceptions, so most will be easy to capture.<br>
<br>
And if need be, you can cancel hyper escape with OFCOTD.<br>
<br>
There is no No Escape b/c you will easily be occupying 3 battleground systems.  If not, you’re probably gonna lose anyways...<br>
<br>
They’ve shut down the main reactor is the card that will win games.  Wait while they move all their starships away, then prevent the last one from moving until the end of your turn.  If you use it during your turn, you get an even better deal - TWO turns to beat them down if they are stupid enough not to forfeit their ship.<br>
<br>
VS PROFIT<br>
can be hard against a good one.... start arica to slow them down and minimize damage against her if they remember to have a corran.<br>
<br>
VS hidden base and EBO<br>
if they play x-wings, capture them and use them against them.  if they use unique starfighters, they won’t have enough fight with after you capture the main ones.<br>
<br>
VS MWYHL<br>
drain and use FWKTIL, most of these don’t have enough space to keep up.<br>
<br>
VS any mains deck<br>
your objective will help keep piet and merrejk alive, as you can’t take any battle damage on the D*.  just be careful to keep merrejk alive as long as possible.<br>
<br>
VS Senate<br>
Not sure, but this would probably be a harder matchup.  stick to your plan and rule any systems they put down. <br>
<br>
<br>
I’ve playtested it, and it works infinately better than flip SYC.  Most LS decks will have the ultimatum shield, so the drain bonuses won’t help much. <br>
<br>
I’ll update the strat if necessary<br>
<br>
thx for the help and reviews<br>
