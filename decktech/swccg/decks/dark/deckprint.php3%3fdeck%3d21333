Some may think, what am I doing hunting the queen ? well the principle of this deck is to get maul to landing site and lott to the senate early to set up a total drain of three by 2nd or 3rd turn, after that lott dodd will decide what happens  by searching through my force pile for what I need. In the odd chance they use amidala (low in my area) I will persue her and I will use lightsabers and evzan to kill the jedi and capture her and run to naboo. After that, if the trace was correct will hurt the opponent, especially if they play on tatooine.<br>
	This deck can come up with high drains with lightsabers and motion supported. This deck is also a battling deck with many high power characters, weapons and battle destiny adders. This deck only has modest destiny but power makes up for lack of destiny.<br>
This deck uses squabbling delegates, sith probe druids and rune to retrieve force.<br>
	Some other cards in this dexk look unusual. Chokk stops forfeit from being reduced and is good for defense, there still cumin through stops many cards like portal,barrier and is esily ciculable, dioxis helps stop jedi, even though I have edcel Tarkin can stop other destinys. I use endor occ. Combo to stop celebs. <br>
	I play most decks similar, sit back and drain at my sites, go after the queen if nesscesary. With profit I defend han very carefully. Combat a hard machup, I haveto go on full offense against my oppents jedi.<br>
	I have no starships because I have no room and I don’t nescessarily need them.<br>
I have no newer Vaders, and I have no emperors or sidious<br>
<br>
I will make stalking legal<br>

Thanks for reading<br>
