Why? Order to Engage can*t hurt you. Think about it, if you were playing Outer Rim Scouts or some stuff like that you*d die with OTE. Your retrieval won*t be able to handle that. Try to keep that in mind. Also this deck is pretty flexible, swap out cards if you need for your local meta. I love probots. :)<br>
<br>
Error in decklist: Drop the EV9D9 for Search and Destroy.<br>
<br>
This deck is merely a draft; it is the seed of an deck idea. I do believe it is new, though the concept of Hit and Run is not! It*s just something for people to try out instead of moaning about the umpteen HDADTJ or Throne Room mains deck.<br>
<br>
Start with Well Guarded always. There is bound to be someone who plays heavy Grim in your place. :( If there isn*t you can take the risk of starting ABC against Ops. You start with ISB and Coruscant, or Imperial Square if your area is heavy with HB.<br>
<br>
Before you rate this deck take a look at this strategy section. I will now describe the card combo this deck revolves around :-<br>
<br>
Probe Droid + Self Destruct Mechanism + Scum and Villiany + First Strike<br>
<br>
The combination of Scum and Villiany with First Strike allows for a 4 Force swing every time you initiate battle. In order to initiate a battle and intentionally lose the character, I have utilized the ubiquitous Probe Droid along with a card to lose it, Self Destruct Mechanism.<br>
<br>
You initiate battle for a 4 Force swing, then you play the Boom card and lose your droid. Coupled with ISB, you get to retrieve back your probe droid.<br>
<br>
Now, for the defense against space decks :-<br>
<br>
If you*re going up against HB decks, drain with the probe droids. The heavy drain locations will become killer as you can just deploy Probe Droids there to drain for 3 a turn. Search and Destroy forces them to commit to ground or suffer a 2 a turn loss. If they play with their funky R-3PO then either Restraining Bolt the guy, or just destroy him with Look Sir, Droids. :)<br>
<br>
Against HB: As described before, you drain them out. If they go to ground, get the combo cycling and drain them at other places.<br>
<br>
Against Ops: ABCTTU should handle the jacked up drains. Your drains should win. If possible get your guys over and battle them for the 3 / 1 thing.<br>
<br>
I*m not sure of other matchups. If you actually build this thing and play against other decks let me know! I*m trying to figure in other matchups.<br>
