When I built it I not only wanted to build a droid deck, I also wanted to build a deck without Maul or any Jedi, something to play with just for fun. To my surprise this little deck kicked ass.<br>
<br>
First turn use the OBJECTIVE to search your reserve deck for a location, while you&#146;re in there look for these cards...<br>
<br>
CLOUD CITY: INCINERATOR<br>
NABOO: THEED PALACE THRONE ROOM<br>
ACTIVATE THE DROIDS<br>
RETURN TO BASE<br>
CAPTIAN DAULTAY DOFINE<br>
TRADE FEDERATION DROID CONTROL SHIP<br>
<br>
If any of these cards are not in your hand or reserve deck, draw your cards until you get the one&#146;s you want or all of them. Don&#146;t be afraid to draw all of your cards into your hand, you shouldn&#146;t need to flip your objective for a couple of turns. Hell, you don&#146;t even need to flip to start your retrieval engine, though it does do its job faster if you do.<br>
<br>
Deploy the following cards to the Throne Room when you can.<br>
<br>
3B3-1204<br>
SSA-306<br>
SSA-1015<br>
GURI (or to the Blockade Flagship if your opponent is strong in space)<br>
RUNE HAAKO, LEGAL COUNSEL (don&#146;t deploy him or any Neimoidian to Throne Room until you have all your sites out)<br>
<br>
All other cards deploy anywhere else. Deploy only one character to each site, except the Throne Room. All you want is the force drain. If you opponent comes to battle you, don&#146;t worry. Let them come with the beat down against you lone droid. Lose your one character then play GHHHK. Your opponent just fell into your trap. Next turn deploy your two characters to draw 2 destiny (or one character if that&#146;s all you have) start a battle and retrieve 2 force (ACTIVATE THE DROIDS &amp; FIRST STRIKE). Play GHHHK after you forfeit your droid to the DROID RACKS (did I mention that you don&#146;t want to win the battle.) Your opponent loses 1 force because you started a battle (FIRST STRIKE), any interrupt drawn for battle destiny (OBJECTIVE), any copy of a unique card on table drawn for battle destiny (ABYSS), plus cards lost to attrition and forfeit. You just put a big hurt on your opponent and you lost only one card, the last GHHHK you played and you will get that back with the next battle you start. (Damn that was a long sentence) And guess what? You will more than likely get to do it again on you next turn because your opponent will probably still have a character there. Battle as many times as you can on your turn to do this again and again. Not only will you be putting a hurting on your opponent, you will retrieve more and more force.<br>
<br>
Any droids that you don&#146;t need (and this may happen) forfeit to your lost pile, they become more force for you to activate.<br>
<br>
CARD USES<br>
<br>
DROID RACKS: Goes without saying but I will say it anyway. Pull all of you droids off the racks during each of you turns.<br>
<br>
RETURN TO BASE: Use as a weaker version of the Droid Racks to keep your starships in the game. Always put your capital starships here first. Your droid starfighters you can retrieve later with CLOUD CITY: INCINARATOR. <br>
<br>
ABYSS: This card can greatly speed up the demise of your opponent if they are playing a deck such as a Combat deck that relies heavily on multiple copies of characters.<br>
<br>
REACTOR TERMINAL: During you last turn pull all of the droids off of DROID RACKS and put them back into your life force. Instant life boost.<br>
<br>
TT-6: Deploy to the Swamp. This card is a droid remember. It can drain, be used to help draw 2 battle destiny and can be retrieved with the Incinerator. Plus it lets you deploy cards from your reserve deck.<br>
<br>
TRADE FEDERATION LANDING CRAFT: Get this starship to the Swamp and deploy TT-6 there also. Can be retrieved with the Incinerator, drain, and help with battle destiny.<br>
<br>
MASTERFUL MOVE and the Combo Card: Use one every turn you have it to keep your hand full of GHHHK&#146;s. Very useful destiny numbers to track.<br>
<br>
GHHHK: This is the only card in your reserve deck that this deck depends on. Keep them in your hand. Always save at least one to play incase your opponent comes to battle you.<br>
<br>
YOU SWINDLED ME: This is a great card. You get to activate force so you can draw more Droids or GHHHK&#146;s into your hand, or retrieve more of the same plus others. What you want is retrieval. Wait until you have 2 or all 3 in your hand. Look and see what the top card of your opponents Lost Pile is. If it&#146;s one of his &quot;Big Guns&quot; he&#146;s more likely to let you retrieve, &quot;Swindle&quot; him. Whither you get to retrieve or not play another one as soon as the next turn begins. This way you may retrieve your last Swindle plus others.<br>
<br>
CLOUD CITY: INCINARATOR: Can retrieve Droid Starfighters, TFLC, TT-6, and 14 of your 20 characters. If your opponent comes to take this site, let him have it, he can&#146;t force drain here.<br>
<br>
LOCATIONS: Except for the Throne Room and the Bridge, all force drains against you are 1 or less. If your opponent wants your locations let him have them, they drain you for only 1 (or less) a turn and you retrieve 2 (ACTIVATE THE DROIDS &amp; FRIST STRIKE) next turn when you start a battle. Also they lose 1 (FIRST STRIKE), interrupts (OBJECTIVE), and attrition.<br>
<br>
SITH PROBE DROID: Deploy only to sites you will start a battle at and only if you will be battling again this turn. That way when you start your next battle on Naboo, you will retrieve the SPD.<br>
<br>
BATTLES: Battle as much as you can during each of your turns. Always start on NABOO.<br>
<br>
STUNNING LEADER: This card can deliver a serious killing blow to your opponent. Look for locations where your opponent has a lot of high ability characters with just a few with low ability as cannon fodder. Surprise!! His cannon fodder got lost from the main group and your guys jumped &#146;em. Can you say BEATDOWN!!! Possible with only 2 characters.<br>
<br>
If you want take out the 2 YOU SWINDLED ME&#146;s and replace them with more Naboo sites.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate any help, USEFULL advice, and honest comments about this deck.<br>
