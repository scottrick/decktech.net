Thank you. I didn&#146;t communicate with Bastian or Hawkins on this deck, hence the differences between my deck and the general build they use. <br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
I&#8217;m sure that enough people already know about this deck to go ahead and post it.. <br>
<br>
There isn&#8217;t really much in terms of specific strategies with the deck.. you just sorta have to play it and practice with it. <br>
First couple of turns, draw your race destinies, pull your Death Star sites with SYCFA, and draw some.. The race is usually over on turn 3-5, possibly more if opponent provides disruption.<br>
Early Visage at the conference room is huge, since many people don&#8217;t really expect visage from a non-huntdown deck. Holotable drain is nice as well, so use Visage where you see fit.<br>
SHUOSHD is in to counter Bacta Tank and HDWGITM, which are huge. Hit-and-fade EPP Vader with high destinies can clear sites, and with Brangus, you&#8217;ll never stop the barrage. OOC can be a big problem, hence the Holonet with Masterful Move x4 -and- This is Some Rescue x2.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have nothing better to do with your DBs, you can pitch them to Visage and keep yourself from losing cards (along with PASOA every turn). <br>
<br>
Average destiny minus starting cards and locations that can be pulled is over 4.  <br>
<br>
vs. RST podracing:<br>
I built this deck primarily to counteract the &#8221;boomrace&#8221; deck. Monnok can be huge here, since this deck needs to get lots of cards together to blow up the bunker. Recurring EPP Vaders ensure that the bunker doesn&#8217;t get blown up very easily. <br>
<br>
vs. WYS or QMC:<br>
Recurring Vader with First Strike, potential for Set for Stun recurrance, plus the general lack of spies means that this matchup is in your favor. Be careful of evasion interrupts.<br>
<br>
vs. space:<br>
Draw for your two ships and use Brangus to keep them in your hand or on the table. EPP Vader/Maul/IG, etc. can clear site(s) for Battle Order. <br>
<br>
Basically, just play your game. The deck has quick damage, retrieval, and disruption. <br>
Have fun with it while you can,<br>
Later,<br>
