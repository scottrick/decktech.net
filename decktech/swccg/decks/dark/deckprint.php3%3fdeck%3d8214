It stays in control of the game because once the objective is flipped, you basically have a counter to every strategy out there.<br>
<br>
Specifics:<br>
<br>
<br>
VS. A New Secret Base/EBO<br>
<br>
Start Imperial Decree and develop a presence on Ralltirr quickly; minimal protection on Ralltirr is needed early on, as your opponent will be focusing on getting his EBO going. You do not need to invade Hoth with this objective, though if he dominates space, you may have to. The key to winning this game is to deplete his drains into nothing. The best way to accomplish this is by getting ralltirr flipped, and controlling your Coruscant/Death Star/Ralltirr for Imperial Decree. This will cut his drains down to nothing except at Kiffex/Kessel, and most EBO decks only sport kiffex, and you can take the drain of 1. Your drains on Ralltirr will beat his drain of 1, especially if you can get Search and Destroy working. Later in the game you will need to fortify Ralltirr with At-St&#146;s as your opponenet will most likely come down with an EPP Hit Squad. Alter the Projection of a Skywalker&#146;s and anything that can cancel your drains - Bargaining Table/Rebel Fleet. I feel that if this deck is played correctly, it is nearly impossible to lose this matchup.<br>
<br>
VS. Y4 Mains<br>
<br>
This used to be my most feared matchup, but lately I have been seeing less and less of these with the release of Third Anthology. Start Bad Feeling Have I, hopefully preventing an early obi-wan. My strategy for this matchup is to only deploy the desert until you have enough to flip in one turn. If he send a lot of mains to the desert, sandwhirl them, and shake your opponent&#146;s hand. If you can get Ralltirr flipped, you will need to get Boba Fett In Slave 1 or ZIMH down to Ralltirr to prevent a flipback. Once the objective is flipped, and you can keep it flipped, the game should be yours. Simply evade his mains and drain on Yavin. You can get to Yavin through Mara Jade. Make sure you get IAO order out, you don&#146;t want his mains nabruning around. Alter his Order To Engage because that is the only way he will deal damage against this deck.<br>
<br>
VS. HB Space<br>
<br>
I think this game is an auto-win...Start Bad Feeling Have I to prevent EPP beatdowns, they can only send 1-2 at a time with this out, and you can handle that. Do not deploy coruscant until they deploy coruscant, in which case you replace it. I didn&#146;t include security precauions because it is not needed. Once you replace Coruscant, he can drain you at kessel for 2, and kiffex for 1. You can match these drains on Ralltirr, and in combination with Search and Destroy, it&#146;s a sure victory. Do not deploy starships until he flips, in which case you probe with them. Probe Kessel and Kiffex first, as those are the 2 most likely HB indicators. Once his HB has been discovered, try to build up at kessel so he can&#146;t drain there. I don&#146;t know of many LS starship combinations that can handle Executor/Boskk In Bus/Zuckuss. If he get&#146;s a ship down to Ralltirr early, respond with a starfighter, flip, then land it at the docking bay for free.<br>
<br>
VS. Profit<br>
<br>
This is by far the hardest matchup you will encounter. It is so hard because profit tends to build several mains up and nabrun them around beating the crap out of you. Therefore I start IAO vs. Profit. I recommend flipping a.s.a.p. so you can start getting some ground pound in your hand (Vader/Tarkin, Igar/Tempest 1, Tempest 2/Watts/Marquand). The key to profit games is luring them into the desert on Ralltirr and sandwhirling them. You have to be aggressive with profit and try to kill off Han at all costs, be it through Trample/Choke makes no difference. I think this game just comes down to the draw.<br>
<br>
VS. Ops<br>
<br>
This is basically like EBO on the ground, and you should use the same strategy. Get Imperial Decree going with a flipped Ralltirr and you&#146;ve got the game. They can&#146;t do anything vs. Imp/Flip except send random EPP&#146;s at ralltirr. Though I play a little differently vs. YOPS and Speeder Ops. VS. YOPS, I start IAO and replace their Docking Bay first turn preventing all that cheap deployment. All you have to do with YOP&#146;s is dominate there planet and get the decree going. Choose where you want to beatdown wisely, as an EPP will be coming down next turn in an attempt to clear the site. VS. Speeder OPS, I follow the strategy of Steve Turner, sending everything at the Operative planetthere is simply to much Blue in this deck for the lightside to hang.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have covered the most popular strategies at this time. Vs. Numbers I usually try to flip with only At-St Pilots and get Vesden going, usually I can attain a higher total than them. This deck is solid and will only lose to a good deck played by an expert player.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
