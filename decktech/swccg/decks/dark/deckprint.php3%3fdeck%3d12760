<i>This deck will eradicate, annihilate, decimate, dominate, desecrate, and lay utter ruin.</i><br>
<br>
That&#8217;s what I should have said in the intro. Oh well. I posted this simply because I feel it is the best Hunt Down I built before Reflections 2. It is purely for trackers, and has some tracking tech that ensures all duels are won. Honestly, this deck will never lose a duel unless you try it blindly, which is uneccessary and foolish in most cases. Hmmm, Vader and Tarkin initiate battle, play Weapon Lev to subract 2 from opponent&#8217;s total, Duel and play Focused Attack, Tarkin cancels their destiny, and I have tracked. How can you lose?<br>
<br>
<i><b>My tracking tech is this:</i></b> Beginning of your turn, play Masterful Move after activating 1. Grab Visage. Continue activation. Next, play Operational As Planned and put the Visage on top of your Force pile. Simply use Force throughout your turn, and voila! You now have stacked a 7,5,6 consecutively in the bottom four cards of your deck.<br>
This not only wins duels, but can end games in battling. Gee, I&#8217;ll choke and remove anyone. Fire with Iggy to capture virtually anyone, and draw a six for destiny. Also, you can set this up during the opponent&#8217;s turn. Play OAP and put Visage on top of your pile, then play MM. Activate all but 3...beatings. <br>
<br>
The DB selection gives me immunity to Projections and Lost In The Wilderness. <br>
<br>
<i>Why 3 Chokes and 2 Lords?</i> Choke Vader is the shiz when I track. Definitely my all-time favorite Vader.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Basic strat is this:</b></i> Drop Vader quick and flip. Cause Visage damage. Activate like a champ and draw significantly to track easily. Beat the crap out of opposing ground decks with power characters, walkers, and murderous destinies. Chiraneau often goes to Rendili to drain for 2, which changes the outcome of many a game. If you get low on cards and come across the Dominator, lose it, retrieve it with the Rendili text, track it, and use Janus to get it back into hand. Repeat for an almost infinite retrieval loop. Against EBO and HB, Twi&#8217;Lek for S+D to cause massive damage. This deck can withstand both of their Transmission Terminateds, so Visage WILL be a factor. Drop Empy and cronies to boost drains and track even more. You cant play Duel without Janus. But why 2? Hell, he only costs ONE usually, he boosts drains, and allows me to continue the tracking madness if Operational As Planned is grabbed. Pretty solid if you ask me. Empy can also be used to protect Visage if need be.<br>
<br>
<B>CARDS I WANT TO ADD:</B><br>
<br>
<i>Resistance</i> - EBO isn&#8217;t too much of a concern for me, but if it&#8217;s in the meta, I suggest you add this. Plus, I have no real other Numbers protection.<br>
<br>
<i>Secret Plans</i> - The 61st card in the deck. Retrieval is becoming a saving grace for the LS these days...<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. E</i> - He&#8217;s cool.<br>
<br>
<i>EJP Dengar</i> - He&#8217;s cool with Dr. E.<br>
<br>
<i>ECC 4-LOM</i> - Cancel Ben&#8217;s duel bonus. Ladee Frickin Da!<br>
<br>
<i>Alters</i> - I loathe Bargaining Table, Rebel Fleet, Bacta Tank, etc. But, no room. These are really out of the question IMO.<br>
<br>
<B>MATCHUPS:</B><br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Mains (Hidden Mains, New Age TR, Profit)</b><br>
You have all the tools to waste this deck. You must track, and battle effectively until the time is right to duel. You can easily hang with anything he can possibly throw at you on the ground. Use Choke Vader, Sniper, Weapon Lev, You Are Beaten, and Trample to their fullest. Eventually, there is nothing he can do to stop you from dueling Obi and Luke, and that will polish him off. Oppressive gaurantees he doesnt stop my tracking. I suppose it depends on the player, but this is a matchup that leans heavily in your favor. Ask Matt Lush how hard it is to beat this with a mains deck.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. EBO (Ketwol, X-Wings, whatever) or HB Flip</b><br>
Ketwol isn&#8217;t problematic, unless he gets lucky and draws his Transmission Terminated early and pulls the lock with it. Otherwise, Visage will bend him over, along with S+D. Pick Vader up and try to duel. Sure, Ketwol decks have mad destiny, but you win every time when you track or use Tarkin. Against Wings, set up as fast you can, you have to deal as much damage as possible while he scurries to set up. Eliminate his spies. Be wary of Barrier/Ice Storm. Use ships wisely. Bossk and Zuckuss are money when you track. HB Space shouldnt give you any problems. Direct damage is the key. Probably the hardest matchup, but you still have the advantage.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Agents (Speeders, Fans)</b><br>
This game is pretty easy. I advise you not deploy Vader to the Hutt Trade Route first turn unless you know or seriously feel he doesnt have a Sandwhirl. Some Speeder versions dont use Aliens and Bo Shuda, so sit Vader in the AC if thats the case. If not, put him at a DB until you are given another Tatooine location to put him at where he is safe. Throw your crew to Tatooine, and whip his @$$. Fans arent too much of a problem when you Choke, Trample, Sniper, etc. Speeders have always been somewhat difficult, but Visage is so very often ignored by Speeders players, and that means you get the win.<br>
<br>
Thats all I can think of in this late hour. If you would like me to address any concerns, d-mail me.<br>
<br>
<b>RESPONSE TO REVIEWS</b><br>
<br>
ThaBrahmaBul - Look closer. Didn&#8217;t you notice the 2 Janus&#8217;?<br>
<br>
gotenks - I have no problem with you, man.<br>
<br>
Sir Yoda - C&#8217;mon man, I said like 30 times that it was Pre-Reflections 2.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Track Record:</b></u><br>
This variant was only used in one tournament, where it went 2-0. However, it was an absolute machine in playtesting, and wiped the floor with just about everything in the pre-Reflections 2 environment. The release of WYS forced me to adapt and drop the dueling aspect. Thus, Chain Of Command was born.<br>
