Cheesewhiz - yeah the Undercover Spy thing is a good idea, however I had them in there before and they didn&#146;t do much for me. Mara&#146;s a little better in this format because she&#146;s power 6 (Emperor on the Table) and she can deploy most anywhere... and if they come to Tatooine I will just battle them off.<br>

---DECKTYPE---<br>
<br>
As your reading this your wondering, oh great, another stupid Watto deck. Yes, another Watto deck indeed, although unlike the other Watto decks that I’ve seen mine has more characters to counter the many characters that Light Side is starting to incorporate in their decks. So that’s the answer to the first question why are there so many characters... As you read through you’ll see the standard package of Weapons and Ships... the Infiltrator is there just in case... Although in all the games that I have played Maul’s never gone space, but having a nice 6 destiny floating is always good.<br>
<br>
As you head into the red you’ll see some cards that will make you say ... WHAT?!?! - Like You Swindled Me! - Cat, you fool, your saying, Why are you using that? - Well, the reason that card is here is because in the late game, my opponent may have no force saved and I might want to drop something... well I will give him that option of activating 2 and me 4 or retrieving, that’s always good and w/Secret Plans out if they don’t have that force they can’t retreive so many of them go for the activation. Then I drop a card and they can use that 2 they just activated or loose 2. 9 times out of 10 they use the 2 which garnishes me a free character...that’s always nice.<br>
You’ll also take not of the 2 Sense & Uncertain’s - believe it or not this card has saved my deck... When I sensed a friends OOC when he tried to get rid of my Watto (or Prepared Defense) fortunately I had Xizor down and drew a 2 for destiny... or else that would’ve been game. As well when I get to much &#148;jank&#148; in my hand I can drop it and get something better...usually some more characters.<br>
<br>
Other than that most of the cards should be pretty simple to understand... <br>
<br>
A couple of first round actions:<br>
ALWAYS get a Watto out of your deck even if you have one in your hand. While your getting your Watto look and see if the DB is there then get that as well. Also, if it’s in there get Watto’s Chance Cube. This is the card that you want to keep recycling when your opponent has no force and make him loose 2. That way you can cosistently search through your deck and see what’s there... that way if you can you can know what’s in your Force Pile so that you can either not play anything and draw some or whatnot... Just a few tidbits of info on the way that I play the deck.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Against certain decks:<br>
<br>
Well the Hyperdrive deck being the bane because it starts with the Junkyard as well, I orignally had another copy of the Junkyard, but I dumped it because most people don’t use Hyperdrive in non EP1 tournaments.<br>
<br>
Hyperdrive:<br>
Just play like you normally would, make sure you have back up for you Watto and run that way. It shouldn’t be to difficult. You have good destinies and your power should be enough to handle them. Even w/3 Qui-Gon’s.<br>
<br>
Mains & Toys:<br>
Same as above, however you don’t need to back up your Watto as much...but you still want someone there.<br>
<br>
HB:<br>
Wait till they flip then go to space and try and probe their HB quickly w/4 ships you have that possibility of getting it quickly. As well if you probe, collective commute to 1 planet and hold that. You shouldn’t have much of a problem after that.<br>
<br>
Senate:<br>
Well see the first couple...and just go for the outforce drain...and make them loose 2.<br>
<br>
WYS: (for O1Madskills - :))<br>
This isn&#146;t that difficult actually... however the key thing is to take out Luke, Melas and Phylo after that you just sit there and Force Drain, as well for space your &#148;ships (-the Infiltrator)&#148; should suffice you have enough power, and characters to put on to satisfy for Battle Damage/Attrition. Once the Ability 4 guys go poof then you can have Maul walking around and one the Defensive Cards come WYS will be a thing of the past... hopefully.. but all in all it&#146;s a tight deck and it will be a good game regardless.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Well that’s pretty much all that I can think of.. I hope that this doesn’t worry you to much. Enjoy and good luck, and remember if you have any questions on the deck feel free to ask and I will see what I can do about answering it ASAP.<br>
