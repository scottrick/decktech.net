<br>
Also, yes I know that there are only a few characters in the deck the deck doesn&#146;t need more than that cause they can hold all the areas that I need or want. I&#146;ve never had a problem with the characters in the deck<br>
<br>
Oh yeah the other card going in is one that cancells Ouf Of Commission<br>
<br>
Well this is my old Hunt Down tweaked with EP1 cards in it and of course some R3. Now you may be looking at this deck and saying that space is useless you shouldn?t bother or that you don&#146;t have enough against a good space deck and where&#146;s the Search &amp; Destroy --- oh yeah that&#146;s the card that?s coming out for the B4?. anyhow the deck is designed to go to the ground and stay there if you come to me then you will get your assets handed to you or your will be out of play. The destiny in this deck is high enough that if I want I can blind duel?.if I want? but I drop 3 w/Drop! then I activate down to them and then go from there? or I use Janus and Force Lightning to track that way.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately against deck of any particular type it&#146;s all the same get the Executor DB and then drop the other docking bays and force drain and force loss with Visage a Search.<br>
<br>
If their playing Lightsaber Combat then go to them quickly and start FDing and if that doesn&#146;t work then Duel them out of there that shouldn&#146;t be to much of a problem. I&#146;m telling you a first turn DLOTS against a Lightsaber Combat deck is harsh.<br>
<br>
Try and see and you&#146;ll see what I mean<br>
Thanks for rating<br>
