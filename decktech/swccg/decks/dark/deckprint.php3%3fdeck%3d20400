Let me start by saying this deck is mostly just for fun, but has some nice power to it at the same time.<br>
I start with Jabba&#146;s Palace, and pull the Audience Chamber first turn. Depending on how much force my opponent gives me I might or might not pull Jabba from my deck to the AC. Most likely not. Anyway I use any Bantha Foders I have in hand and try to get one of each weequay, and a bantha in hand. I draw the rest. On my second turn I pull the entrance cavern. I usualy plop jabba down in the AC along with galid. Jabba is a key in this deck because he helps out my weequay&#146;s forfeits and helps with my activation problem. Then I go from there. I usualy stick 4 weequays in the AC to back up jabba. If I can get 4 weequays, a bantha, a skiff, and an antipersonal laser cannon at a site which isnt as hard as it sounds, after sacrificing the bantha I have 26 power, a destiny, and a gun shot where + 2 &gt; ability they are LOST. The sail barge is in there just for fun. Please be nice to this deck, because I just want to make it effective without being full of mains. All of the force activation stuff is in there because force activation is a real killer for this deck, and if I go against a force choke deck Im screwed. The extra den is in there in case the first one gets canceled. Oh and the average destiny is 2.7 here is what the layout looks like.<br>
<br>
Total of 58 cards.<br>
0&#146;s = 7<br>
1&#146;s = 1<br>
2&#146;s = 17<br>
3&#146;s = 14<br>
4&#146;s = 13<br>
5&#146;s = 5<br>
6&#146;s = 0<br>
7&#146;s = 1<br>
<br>
Basically more than half the time my destiny will be a 3 or greater.<br>
