The Torture's instead of the numbers canceling effect should help to remind you. Basically, this is a high destiny deck, based on SYCFA. Why that particular objective? To be honest, I don't know. HuntDown required to many extra cards, and this seemed like the next best choice. I'm immune to Revo, and I pull a 2/0 site first turn. Pretty good starting activation too. Anyway, you're probably wondering why I can call this tech. I'll show you a few examples. Shocking Revelation is great in this deck. Why you might ask? Because this deck revolves so much around characters that Oola is a big problem. Plus, it's a recyclable 5 and since I start with a Scomp Link on the table, I can always recycle it. Blast Door Controls is huge. Barrier is a problem for this deck because of the limited amount of characters and starships. BDC cancels it, and also cancels Narrow Escape for some anti-Profit tech. Now Boring Conversation Anyway is pure tech. Let's say I don't get out BDC, or it gets Altered. I Barrier someone, they Skywalkers my Barrier. So I BCA that Skywalkers. This card is huge. A used 5 that cancels 3 of the best destiny adders in the game, as well as Surprise Assault. Great Card. Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down is a meta card. Rescue the Princess is coming back, and this cancels HDWGITM?, Death Star Plans, and Bacta Tank, the latter of which is often used anyway. Anti EBO is Masterful Move x2 and Monnok x2, as well as ships that are, for the most part, immune to some amount of attrition, and a Lateral Damage for beatdown purposes. This is a great deck, with great tech, so try it out.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
