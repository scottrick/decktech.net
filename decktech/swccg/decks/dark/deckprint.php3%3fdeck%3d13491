&#8221;If Resistance was in here you&#8217;d get 5 stars, but this deck will really die to any EBO w/ X-Wings. Nuff said&#8221;  It wouldn&#8217;t die to EBO X wings.  Read the matchup VS EBO, I go can drain for 8 a turn plus Search and Destroy.  That is not bad at all.<br>
<br>
Note, I will be playing this deck after a little bit more playtesting, at a tourney this saturday.  I will post my observations after that.<br>
<br>
Please Read the Strat section before your rate the deck.  If you not going to read it, please don&#8217;t rate the deck, unless you are going to give it 5 stars.<br>
<br>
Here is a brief rundown of the first few turns:<br>
First Turn:  Pull Carida, AC, and DS2 Docking Bay, Lando.  Deploy M&#8217;yom from reserve to the AC, and deploy Lando there as well if you have enough force.  Pull a Monnok/Evader with Crush.  You&#8217;ve now got you manip set up.<br>
<br>
Turn Two!  Now you have quite a bit of force, (9 to be exact)  Play M&#8217;yom if they&#8217;ve got a small hand, drain at the AC.  Drop the other remaining Docking Bays.  If they deployed any characters go kill em!<br>
<br>
Reasons for cards:<br>
Vader&#8217;s Stick x3!?!?!?  Jeez isn&#8217;t that a few too many?  Nope, it recycles back in when you play the non-combo Evader.  <br>
<br>
Emperor x3?!!?  Well, he is a destiny 6, and he is awesome.  Force Lightning at will, and he and another character can hold a site.<br>
<br>
Masterful Move x2  yes I know that it does not pull the monnok/evader&#8230; It is an awesome trackable 6.<br>
<br>
Destany Breakdown:<br>
Five 6&#8217;s<br>
Eight 5&#8217;s<br>
<br>
Not bad considering they recycle.<br>
I do have other low destinies, but you can track the Twi&#8217;leks and Masterful Moves.  Not a hard feat. <br>
<br>
Why no ships?  Well, there aren&#8217;t too many; decks out there except EBO.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
VS EBO<br>
Well, as you may have noticed I have 1 ship.  I get Search and Destroy out and running as soon as possible.  I drop PotFs down at where Palpy and Vader are, drop Vader&#8217;s Stick, and I have got some nice drains going.  I can also drop Mara with her stick, and out drain them.  It is better not to fight them, because legendary straighter will kill me.  M&#8217;yom whenever you&#8217;ve got enough force, and Monnok whenever they go of 13 cards.  When they leave that lone Tala 2 with no force left to play Out of Nowhere, you go Lateral Damage, and kill it with ZiMH.<br>
<br>
VS WYS<br>
Well this is what this deck is designed to beat.  First turn play Lando to the DS2 Docking Bay; don&#8217;t play M&#8217;yom to the AC, because they will get beat down.  Soon as they put there little crap characters to flip, you take Vader, and pals to beat the F out of them.  You forfeit Vader, but play regular evader.  Since there are 5 in the deck, getting him back out should not be a problem.  Just continually beat them up, and off of Tatooine.  The only good characters that they could really play are Luke, Boussh, and JP Sealed Lando.  Not a threat at all.  Get Search and Destroy set up, and it is like they are draining of only 1 at Kessel.  Get ZiMH and lateral damage, and hopefully play it against Dash, because his ship will be Power Zero, and will not have his special little ability.  Hehe.<br>
<br>
VS Other stuff, then kill them.  Then Drain.  <br>

<br>
If you put some stupid comment and rate me low, I will do the same to you, please don&#8217;t be an a-hole and it won&#8217;t happen.<br>
