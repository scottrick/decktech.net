It kills the Combo, which was good, but I was never fond of it anyway.  So you take out that crap, you take out a Put all sections or 2 since you can&#146;t loop docking bays(unless they don&#146;t play the shield) and that makes some room for some offensive cards.<br>
Now the deck can do some real damage.  It gets good force activation, has a few spots to drain, and plenty of characters to do that all important battle damage.<br>
Why play Brangus and the Docking bays, why not just put in a couple other cards?  Which cards to put in.  The two docking bays can become any other card in your lost pile any time you want it.  You can turn an Epp Vader or EPP Maul into 3 EPP Vaders or 3 EPP Mauls.  You know how many guys you can kill with 3 Mauls, a lot.  First Strike makes these suicide runs even more profitable.  Win the race and retrieve your characters back for another round.  The same EPP Maul can go battle 5 or 6 times in this deck-that&#146;s why I play Brangus.<br>
<br>
Most Matchups are the same with this deck.  If they are mostly ground, use Vader and Maul to kill everyone.  Win the race, do some battle damage, and drain in the cantina or on their sites.  If they are playing a space deck, then win the race, get in the cantina with Emperor and Janus, use Mara and Stick to drain at Podrace arena.  Use the Tat Maul in space where they have low ability to block a drain(or probe against hidden base).  Use Bossk, Zuckuss, Fett for some battles and loop them back into hand with Brangus.  Throw forfeit fodder for your battle and if they battle back you can retrieve a ship and redeploy it next turn.  That should take care of a few of their systems and give you plenty of time to get way ahead in life force.<br>
<br>
WYS is 50/50-EPP Maul will improve those odds though.<br>
<br>
Lightsaber combat is tricky-get blast door controls out to cancel barrier and then go after Qui-gon.<br>
<br>
QMC-Grab Path, they will most likely use it to move away from a beating.  Use Vader first, make them path, grab it.  Next time, use Maul(or mara or ig if you need to) and do some damage.  stay away from bespin until late game-legendary starfighter hurts.  Hold Tatooine to get around battle plan-clean off their sites to prevent celebration and make them pay to drain in space.<br>
<br>
RST is a fun game to play against.  The race is 50/50.  after that you gotta prevent the bunker from getting blown up.  Brangus needs a hand to work with. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
