 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Obviously this is a CCT deck that does NOT try to flip! Do not even think that I would. It is dumb, and it invites yourself to a beatdown from Frozen Assets. This deck is all about control. You set up your game, then @#$% up your opponent. Emperor + helpers go to a docking bay, you pull out all your sites for good activation, and then you just beat down. The destiny is decent, but Janus makes it godlike. You can wipe out systems by tracking 6s. If you&#146;re playing a deck that you can&#146;t beat down, set up a couple solid drains, slap down Search and Destroy, and wait. Honor won&#146;t do anything cuz you will occupy the battlegrounds, and you can do very well in space with your fleet, the Admirals&#146;s Order, and the destiny. <br>
<br>
Something else that you should note is the way that this deck just destroys WYS. Taking away Han is huge because that&#146;s one less character they can use, and they can&#146;t set up the Super Falcon. It also hurts the beatdown version because no Don&#146;t Get @#$%y and no extra weapon and no tripling damage. You will own the Tatooine system if they don&#146;t have Han, and then you play Battle Deployment, limiting their destinies. Thrawn will stop it from being replaced, and you will win. Secret Plans and the grabbers help too.<br>
<br>
Some card choices now:<br>
<br>
Young Fool: This card is extra tech because it makes an early attack on the Emperor a very bad idea. If all else fails, you can cycle it back with Janus. Destiny 6 is great.<br>
<br>
Janus x2: You need him. He is your god. He puts back all your good destiny and gives you cards you need. He is all knowing. Love him.<br>
<br>
Masterful Move/Monnok: Another destiny 6, and a counter to WYS and EBOX decks. I want to know what I&#146;m going up against, so this definitely helps.<br>
<br>
So few Sites: All you need. They all get pulled out, and the activation is pretty big if you&#146;re on both DBs. <br>
<br>
Mighty Jabba: Adds a destiny with 4-LOM and Fett. Kills Profit. They will not be able to take the chamber back unless they get damn lucky with destiny.<br>
<br>
Blast Door Controls: Barrier and Narrow Escape SUCK! So cancel them. Easy enough. Meta choice for around here. Lots of WYS and the like. <br>
<br>
That&#146;s about it since you can figure out matchups. I have faith in you. Just remember the WYS Killer. Cuz it is. Honestly. D-Mail with any questions. Enjoy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
