You have big pile of mains to do<br>
this. Also there is no shortage of combat related interrupts.<br>
<br>
Activation is exellent as in most SYCFA Decks. So to get most of this there is two Miiyoms.<br>
This deck is no manipulator and should not played as. Activation also helps to give your<br>
opponent a good beatdown.<br>
<br>
Starfleet is quality over quantity. Use it wisely and you can punish most decks at space too.<br>
Also many of the mains are pilots too, so you can play them to space if necessary.<br>
If Falcon is your nightmare, play GURI to space(Executor will really do the job).<br>
If X-wings are coming, keep your ships together. Together they can combo and should be able<br>
to hold against their swarm. If guns are possible, keep your guys in capitals. <br>
Battle deployment with Thrawn is iron here(-2 to power of each X-wing!).<br>
<br>
Dont play too many ships on your low parsec systems as Kessel might pop up! You CAN move DS if necessary to get there.<br>
<br>
Your drains are not huge, and the idea is that you go where opponent hangs around. If opponent<br>
goes space SAD will hurt him.<br>
<br>
You shoud be able to fight and probably punish them anywhere. So this deck is built to be SOLID!<br>
<br>
Alright then here comes the matchups:<br>
<br>
MWYHL: Drain heavily and battle. When they are about to do JT5, screw thier tracking with<br>
uncertain is the future!<br>
<br>
EBO: Fight in space, rule the ground and drain. Walkers can storm Hoth if necessary. Degree will help.<br>
<br>
WYS: Take space, use Guri there if necessary. Grap their key interrupt. Conquer ground, Thrawn and Battle deployment will do wonders in your conguest for Tatooine. Their smugglers cant compete with your powerfull mains!<br>
<br>
RTP: Rule space, fight in ground. Try cancel bacta tank and kill the princess(many times).<br>
&quot;Shut him up or shut him down&quot; will be their death.<br>
<br>
QMC: Take Bespin=win, so A LOT OF FORCE THERE!<br>
<br>
Mains: Battle and drain. Miiyom will hurt them much. You will out power them.<br>
<br>
Agents in court: Start Battle order. Aliens and droids can strike them. Imperials will probably have to move to JP. Walkers can attack to sandstormed sites.<br>
<br>
HP: Get SAD ASAP. Rule ground. Play carefully with your fleet.<br>
<br>
Profit: Put Mara and Dr E &amp; PB to AC. Send more guys ASAP. Drain them from space. Crush them<br>
in ground.<br>
