In most battles I get 2 destinies and they are around 4 or 5. Most people, even mains must forfeit and I&#146;ll capture them with All Wrapped Up. Also, Dengar with Gun and other pepl will hit pepl and they&#146;ll have to forfeit. Also, Iggy with Gun and Snoova with his ax will capture them. I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll have a hard time feeding them to the Rancor.<br>

OK this deck is kewl and it beat my friend by 33. He didn&#8217;t have a chance. He is strangling me right now. Anyway, I use Court to get the ships and then beat them up. I also use my massive alien power on the ground to KICK HIS ASS!!!!<br>
<br>
Why Niado Duegad?<br>
He is THA MAN!!! He deploys for 3 and can have power 8!!!! Who wouldn&#8217;t put him in their deck???<br>
<br>
Why Blast Door Controls? <br>
This card is just tech in here. This is a beatdown deck, and Rebel Barriers aren&#8217;t cool. This card cancels them. Thinking about leaving your lone guy at a site draining for 2 with several Rebel Barriers in your hand. Well HAHAHA if you are. You are so dead.<br>
<br>
Why so many Jabbas Palace Sites?<br>
Against a deck that doesn&#8217;t like to battle you, or is just space, put down all of your sites, and deploy hunters there. Get Gailid, and drain away.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
vs. Profit<br>
Start Mighty Jabba and Prince Xixor, because you get 2 destinies right off the bat, and on your first turn you can get Ephant or Boelo to go with Jabba. Also, Xixor makes them have 6 ability to draw destiny. <br>
In the beginning, swarm the Audience Chamber, especially with Bib, Boelo, and Ephant. DON&#8217;T let them unfreeze Han, and it will be hard to with all of your power and no spies, gamblers and thieves can go there. If they do unfreeze him, Bib will keep him there and you can capture him or kill him. A fairly easy game, because they can&#8217;t drain pretty much anywere.<br>
<br>
vs. Hidden Base or EBO with non-uniques<br>
Get all your ships in hand with Court, then do a bunch of concentrated attacks on their people, with several destiny and huge power. Fun. Drain a WHOLE bunch on the ground with Gaylid and a lot of sites.<br>
<br>
vs. QMC<br>
Same thing as HB or EBO, get the ships and attack the space, except that you should drain only at AC and JP, with Mighty Jabba, Ephant, and Gaylid at AC, and Sail Barge with some hommies on it at JP, for 4 each turn. Then attack them at Cloud City with all of your hunters.<br>
<br>
vs. WYS ground<br>
DON&#8217;T deploy to their docking bays, drain at Jabba&#8217;s Palace. They don&#8217;t have much drains, so they will try to attack you, where you capture them and feed them to the Rancor. If they Trap Door your Rancor, that sucks but retrieve by battling and then get it back with ISEWYD. Keep beating them up, and they&#8217;ll die. If they try to control Tatooine system, then pull all of your starships and beat the @#$% out of them. <br>
<br>
vs. WYS space. <br>
Drain a bunch on the ground and Jabba&#8217;s Palace, and mebbe attack them in space, but not if they&#8217;re too powerful. Kessel Run sucks, but it won&#8217;t do too much. If you can, control Kessel, so it is canceled. Deploy Search and Destroy and make them lose to that and get really annoyed.<br>
<br>
vs. RST<br>
Drain at the Jabba&#8217;s Palace sites. Pull the ships and attack at Endor system, unless they stockpile there. Unless they start Insurrection, Elis all of your hommies over to a weak site and beat the @#$% out of them. <br>
<br>
That&#8217;s all of the matchups I can think of right now, so tell me if there&#8217;s something I forgot and I&#8217;ll add it.<br>
The future world champ who is crazy, Philip <br>
