<br>
                 This deck was made in a jest at first to play against the upcoming QMC deck but it had some different cards in it, but I<br>
                 wanted to actually make it a viable deck for now so I did and this is what I came up with. <br>
<br>
                 It’s quite simple really you get your starting stuff out and then fish for Dark Deal first, then the Cloud City Occupation,<br>
                 oh, and first turn fetch the Executor w/Mobilization Points so you don’t have that ciruclating (before you activate). Once<br>
                 you activate fetch the Death Star II: Docking Bay (if there) and drop a scrub, yes I know it’s not Cloud City, but that’s a<br>
                 +2 Force Activation momentarily, when you activate for your second turn, not barring sites you should have something<br>
                 like 9 to 10 force not counting your opponent and you only give up 2 or 3 (on the first turn). After a few turns get that<br>
                 scrub off the D*II DB cause he’ll get squished, of it you have the extra stuff after you’ve secured a decent set up with at<br>
                 least ability of 4 (or more) then move someone there to back him up. <br>
<br>
                 The average drains in the this deck w/DD out, and no assistance from your opponent is 15 (that’s the high) average<br>
                 about 9. Most people will just tell me that, oh Jedi Testing will kill your force drain bonuses, yes, it will but not for long,<br>
                 cause it will take them at least 7 turns to get it to go, and after the 3rd I am usually draining fro about 9. Also, Menace<br>
                 Fades isn’t that nasty against me cause they have to hold both a system and a battle ground, and well my space is<br>
                 small, it’s powerful where I need it. And as for ground, well I have plenty of that as well. <br>
<br>
                 Against most every deck just set up as normal and force drain hard. Let them make the mistake of coming to you. Don’t<br>
                 deploy to Bespin or Bespin: Cloud City (vs: Hidden Base) till you have the ground secured. Then just drop, flip, and then<br>
                 back up. You’ll be safer that way. And remember, Talon Roll/Dark Manuever the OS’s in the clouds where they become<br>
                 HUGE! <br>
