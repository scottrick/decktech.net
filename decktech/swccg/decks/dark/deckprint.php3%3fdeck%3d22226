<br>
listen nerd, yes people play hidden base in my area, thats why i have strategy for it, thats why i play security precaustions. its a tough matchup, but winnable almost every time. is there any reason to give me a 2.5 rating. no there isn&#8217;t. speaking of unconstructive reviews.... hey wait thats you. you smell.<br>
<br>
***END speach about FAG***<br>
<br>
----v2.0 changes----<br>
<br>
Well me being the idiot that i am, i did not realize that BHBM did not allow scanning crew to be played. so i have added in new things in its place.<br>
<br>
As well, thanks for the reviews, i have learned that my activation is way too low. so i have added 4 twix locations which considerably raise the level of activation in this deck.<br>
<br>
i took out one of the mara jades, the 3 scanning crews, the overload, and bossk in hound&#8217;s tooth.<br>
<br>
added 4 twixes, sniper & dark strike and hutt smooch & defensive fire. i was also missing a card so add The circle is now complete.  <br>
<br>
With the new activation i beleive this deck gains a huge push forward. <br>
<br>
play the deck as before, except, obviously you DONT USE the SCANNING CREWS. also, its fairly easy to get out the twixes. you should have one in your starting hand. then you can draw the rest, and what you dont draw you can easily Janus for. this deck looks to have low destiny. but by mid-game i have janused out all the bad destinies and jaunused in all the good destiny, so it works nicely. <br>
<br>
i new trick that i found works good, is id just as soon kiss a wookie obi-wan when he is deployed, then on your turn deploy vader to that site w/ his saber. then on the next turn when they have to deploy obi, you play the circle is now complete, its quite fun.<br>
<br>
anyway, once again, constructive reviews please. thanks alot, long live SWCCG. <br>

----end v2.0 changes----<br>
<br>
 <br>
----Original v1.0 strategy----<br>
<br>
This is my New-Age BHBM Deck. It deals a signifigant amount of damage early on leaving your opponent &#8220;wounded&#8221; for the rest of the game. It takes the old-school style of BHBM and adds a little manipulation to get around shields that were the only thing stopping this deck from being a regular in today&#8217;s SWCCG environment. <br>
<br>
This deck starts with the regular bhbm stuff, along with Imperial Arrest Order & Secret Plans, Conduct Your Search and You Cannot Hide Forever & Mobilization Points. Before you activate grab Carida w/ mobilization points (if its not suspeneded &#8211; note: unless your opponent is using the actual effect and not the shield you can still pull Carida because they do not have an action before you activate, thus they cannot deploy a shield), also grab Endor: Back Door w/ Conduct your search. <br>
<br>
Get empy and janus down to back door first turn. (note: empy comes out of the reserve deck using the objective. And you will more times than not draw janus in your opening hand since there are 3). Pull out force lightning, and draw any left over. <br>
<br>
With Empy and Janus at the Back Door you can drain for 3 most of the early game untouched. This is crucial as you are doing some good damage early while you set up your hand for beatdowns etc. <br>
<br>
Get vader down to the endor: docking bay as soon as you can. second turn is very common. Pull out search & destroy from reserve deck, throwing You Cannot Hide Forever & Mobilization Points into lost to do so. This will put the heat on your opponent to deploy. If your opponent already has guys on the ground no-problem, deploy search and destroy anyway, and get ready to send some guys to get rid of them. <br>
<br>
The turn after you get vader down, the opponent will most likely deploy luke down, this is where you I&#8217;d just as soon kiss a wookie luke right back to their hand. Next turn they lose 3 from your destiny, you drain for 4 or 5 depending on whether vader has his saber on him or not. And they lose some additional force whether they have guys down or not from search and destroy. This is a minimum 7 force loss for the opponent second turn (which is huge.) This force loss could even reach up to 10 a turn (on the second turn.) note: there are 3 I&#8217;d just as soon kiss a wookie&#8217;s in this deck, which are easy to get out drawing and using janus, so your opponent must lose 3 to your destiny from turn 2-4&#8230;.. which is 9 force loss. <br>
<br>
This will force your opponent to react quickly, leaving him open to poor decisions based on necessity for the opponent to stop all this damage. This leads me to the next area of the deck &#8211; manipulation. The key manipulation in this deck is sense & alters, as well as, scanning crew. Sense and alter shut down the opponents interrupts and effects. While, scanning crew takes valuable mains out of the opponents hands which (s)he needs to stop all the damage. The only problem w/ these 2 manipulative cards is that there are defensive shields to stop them. However, the opponent can only play 2 defensive shields. If you save these cards for the first few turns of the game you can get around this. Now almost any player will use battle plan to slow your drains, and ultimatum to get rid of your drain of 3 at the back door. They will also use the don&#8217;t do that again shield to stop mobilization points (note: this will leave you without the pulling of search and destroy, but you can still draw for it or janus for it.) this will successfully leave your opponent with now free shields. Allowing you to use your two forms of manipulation (and old-school!) with ease. <br>
<br>
With the damage and manipulation and the cards it takes to pull it off. Your opponent will not be left with much. But in terms of cards either to get rid of that are fulfilling search and destroy, or cards that they have sent to attack your damage causers you have a great deal of support:<br>
<br>
Darth Maul, Young Apprentice<br>
Darth Maul x2<br>
Mara Jade x2<br>
Dr. Evanzan & Ponda Baba<br>
IG-88 w/ Riot Gun<br>
Blizzard 4<br>
<br>
Everyone knows how to use these cards. If you can, Just get mauls saber out send him down w/ the good doctor hit 2 guys and operate them both. Mara jade x2 and ig-88 can also clean up the mess. While blizzard 4 can fight as well, but it is mainly in to get out vader for free. support cards include:<br>
<br>
Maul Strikes<br>
I Have You Now<br>
You Are Beaten<br>
Overload<br>
Force field<br>
Sense and Alter<br>
<br>
In terms of space, you&#8217;ve got:<br>
<br>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter<br>
Boba Fett in Slave 1<br>
Bossk in Hound&#8217;s Tooth<br>
Dengar in Punishing One<br>
<br>
W/ Support cards of Lateral damage, sense and alter and overload.<br>
<br>
If your opponent if playing pure space then send maul to space as well (on Zuckuss in mist hunter.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Card Explanations:<br>
<br>
Security Precautions &#8211; hidden base is a tough matchup, w/ this card it is no longer.<br>
<br>
Weapon Levitation &#8211; gets out your sabers<br>
<br>
Projective Telepathy &#8211; battle protection<br>
<br>
Force Field &#8211; protects your sith.<br>
<br>
You Are Beaten &#8211; take important characters out of battles<br>
<br>
Overload &#8211; gets rid of pesky x-wing laser cannons<br>
<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
WYS &#8211; moderate matchup. The key is using your space well. The damage will heart them bad. Maul recks WYS. Zuckuss in mist hunter is key as well. The most powerful character is WYS is Luke and your are stealing him. <br>
<br>
QMC &#8211; pretty tough. The damage will hurt them bad early, as they try to set up. Hopefully they will lose some of their key retrieval early on. Sense and alter owns, since they depend on path of least resistance and dodge.<br>
<br>
Lightsaber Combat &#8211; tough matchup. But winnable when played properly. Make sure to get the damage going A.S.A.P. Vader wont be able to drain, but at least he still deals your destiny damage. If LSC is popular in your area, you might wanna think about playing a different deck.<br>
<br>
Profit &#8211; put mara and the good doctor in the chamber to start. Begin doing your damage and reinforce the chamber w/ maul and the rest of the crew. Except leaving vader and empy and janus doing there thing on endor. He wont know whether to attempt free han or to stop the damage. And what to do with luke hahahhahahaha. I love bhbm. <br>
<br>
Senate &#8211; well this will be interesting, just play as the strategy says. Should be easy, unless they have a really wacked version of senate. <br>
<br>
EBO &#8211; damage fast = win. They need a lot of stuff to get set up. All your damage will cause them to lose some of this key stuff causing you to laugh when they cannot set up ebo. And if they do set up. Sense and alter owns their space since 90% of ebo decks play x-wings that run away in space. But how are u gonna run away from my ships when I play sense???? That is what I thought, you wont be running anywhere except to the lost pile.<br>
<br>
RST &#8211; hahah. BHBM owns RST. I have never won by less then 30 against this deck. Bhbm was just made to beat it. All your damage plus pressure on the bunker will cause for a quick game, one with out any blowing of any bunkers. Did I mention that you do all your damage on endor?? Could that mean that if help be needed you could just move over vader etc???. yes that is what it means. <br>
<br>
<br>
That is about it. I hope that my strategy section successfully teaches you the power of this deck. Constructive reviews are appreciated. Please don&#8217;t review negatively if you are unable to back up your judgement. If anyone has any ideas about how to use any of the new virtual cards in this deck that would be appreciated as well. <br>
