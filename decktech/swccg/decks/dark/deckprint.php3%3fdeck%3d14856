everything. But I made a few changes (namely taking out some 1&#146;s for <br>
higher destiny) and now it plays great. My only loss since then (3 <br>
months) was a Timed Loss to a WYS deck that I was going to drain out on <br>
the next turn.<br>
<br>
The basic strategy I use is to set up the Emperor at Cloud City with <br>
Janus and Mara Jade to start annoying them with drains. After that I <br>
play reactionary. Grand Admiral Thrawn is usually enough to handle <br>
space. I&#146;m not terrible concerned with crushing them in every battle or  <br>
finishing them with 1 battle. But it has the power to do so if needed. <br>
All I want to do it win 3 or 4 battles and duel if I have to.<br>
<br>
I hold Vader until I&#146;m ready to either Circle Obi, or capture Luke. I <br>
don&#146;t want to deploy him early because of Luke, Rebel Scout and because <br>
of the direct damage on my flipped side. After I capture Luke, I <br>
continue to use Vader on the ground to either drain or battle. I avoid <br>
draining on the ground or initiating a battle at Docking Bays unless I <br>
have a Sense or two. If they flip WYS or have Wise Advise &amp; Do, or Do <br>
Not, then I just lose the cards to Force Drains.<br>
<br>
I have beaten better players then me with this deck, playing their <br>
strong decks. You just have to be patient with your set up. The deck <br>
has great activation which will allow your to find and drop your combos <br>
when needed.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hidden Base<br>
Set up your drains at Cloud City and Endor fast. Use You Cannot Hide <br>
Forever to get Search and Destroy. Get Thrawn ready to drop and battle <br>
a weak system. Add Zuckuss and Xizor in the Virago for an extra punch.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hidden Base Fakeout<br>
Set up at Cloud City first. Fortify with your big guns... Emperor <br>
Palaptine, Mara Jade with Dr. Evazan and a Royal Guard is nice too. <br>
Protect yourself with Imperial Barriers, You Are Beaten and Dark Stike <br>
to reduce and beatdowns. Always save activated Force!!<br>
<br>
Vs. Watch Your Step<br>
Avoid battles against multiple Smugglers. Drain heavyly at the Cantina <br>
with Mara Jade, and Darth Vader, DLOTS. Use your interrupt to kill off <br>
characters BEFORE they can draw destiny. Without Luke, WYS should be <br>
hurting on the ground. Use Grand Admiral Thrawn and Impeial Command or <br>
Zuckuss to win battles in Space. Secret Plans will help, catch Harvest!<br>
<br>
Vs. EBO<br>
Like Hidden Base, set up fast and drain with Search and Destory. Don&#146;t <br>
play any space until you&#146;re ready to drop Thrawn to battle. If they <br>
deploy Luke to the 4th Marker, try to get him with Always Thinking With  <br>
Your Stomach.<br>
<br>
Vs. Profit<br>
I haven&#146;t played on of these yet, but deploy Dr. E and Mara Jade. First <br>
turn get her Lightsaber and Force Lightening out. Be prepared to fight <br>
it out or move to Jabba&#146;s Palace if they use Bo Shuda. The Alters are <br>
there for a reason, get rid of Order to Engage.<br>
<br>
Vs. Numbers<br>
You Cannot Hide Forever<br>
<br>
Vs. Asteroid Sanctuary<br>
Set up like Hidden Base. Drain and Search and Destroy. Use your Alters <br>
when you can.<br>
<br>
Thank you for looking at my deck. If you have any suggestions I&#146;d be <br>
happy to hear them. Thank you.<br>
