It depends on what the opponent is playing whether you go down to them or drain on naboo. Try and get out deep hatred because you can use that for the duelling. You can send Vader down to obi wan`s site and duel and they will lose 9 force and place out of play. You can put backup characters there or you can use elis herlot to transport him back to naboo. There is very good destiny in the deck for duelling and battling and for the counter assaults.<br>
<br>
You get good force generation from the naboo sites and good force draining. Lightsabers add to it and the presence of the forces. Imperial barrier is for stopping a character from battling. The 3 visage of the emperor is for the destiny and the 4 intruder missiles are just for destiny and duelling. If you are draining on naboo and you have Elis herlot and you see an opportunity to beatdown then play it, it`s very good.<br>
<br>
-vs- lightsaber combat<br>
quite hard matchup, try and get out deep hatred for your destiny&amp;#8217;s and once they deploy obi wan combat him and you should win and they lose 9 force and obi wan. Try and convert their sites so your game text is much better and try to outdrain and play counter assult if you see the opportunity.<br>
<br>
-vs- there is good in him<br>
deploy the naboo docking bay and try to get out your sites so you can start draining, send vader over and capture luke and beat up the other rebels and if they deploy obi wan combat him and make them lose 9 force. Drain on naboo and at the system, if they play kessel or endor go to them and try to kick them off. U-3PO 	can cancel a force drain.<br>
<br>
-vs- profit<br>
with their objective deploy mara jade and snoova, your turn deploy both their weapons on them and the docking bay and send vader over when you`ve got him, battle the opponent and duel when they deploy obi wan and luke and drain at the naboo system. <br>
