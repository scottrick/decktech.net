<br>
     ok first thing you want to do is start putting out bounties as soon as you get then in your hand. Your also going to want to try to have atlest one bounty hunter at each site. Use interagation array to make your oppenent loose extra force. with they must never again leave this city you can put the executor down free as soon as it gets into your hand.<br>
<br>
some match ups:<br>
<br>
vs. profit put boba fett bounty hunter with snoova at jp: audience chamber. 3 battle destinies and power 13. you should hold it easy for the first 4-6 turns. deploy more there as needed. But for the most part go to another system to force drain. don&#146;t worry light side can&#146;t drain till they free han.<br>
<br>
vs. WYS i haven&#146;t played vs it but I have seen it be played. go to their cantina and capture smugglers as they copme out.<br>
<br>
vs. space you do have some space power but not much so stay to the ground and drain have your ships at dbs. and take off to the system when you know you can win that battle.<br>
<br>
vs. others you should be able to figure it out as you go. All i can really say is capture their mains it always hurts.<br>
