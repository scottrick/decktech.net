<br>
This is basically my old Hunt Down with Reflections 2 in it. It went 2-1 at my last tournament only losing by 8 to Matt Erhrart&#8217;s speeder/numbers. I beat a RST and a HB A-wing deck. Simple to play. You get huge activation from Mob Points. Just plop Vader down to a docking bay and flip. Then drain for 1 and 2 at your sites and make him lose to Visage. Spies cancel it? Then just beat down the crappy spies. Xizor and Mara are good for this. Grab anything annoying like Portal or Barrier or something. This is Some Rescue cancels OOC/TT so it is much better than Holonet Transmission because of it&#8217;s awesome destiny. Just track around your 5&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s so whenever battles happen you win. Put All Sections on Alert kills EPP&#8217;s and suicide mains. They will do nothing. Plus its a used 6. The destiny here is amazing once your low destiny are on table. Space package is small but good. Save up for the beatdown. Counter Assault works great if the time is right. Trust me, I know from experience. Here&#8217;s the plan vs certain decks:<br>
<br>
Vs: Mains or similar<br>
Just sit at your docking bays and play Put All Sections on Alert and kill his guys. Duel Obi and Luke. Leia can&#8217;t do anything. Han will die from attrition or weapons. Your droids can kill anyone else. Nothing too hard just watch out for duel protection or Fallen Portals. I Have You Now is good.<br>
<br>
Vs: AITC Aliens<br>
Sniper Kabe if you can. IG-88 is best bet. Just need to know if he has Its a Trap. Aliens will die from your high destinies and weapons. This deck always has trouble with Hunt Down so shouldn&#8217;t be too tricky. Just watch out for big beatdowns.<br>
<br>
Vs. Speeders<br>
Go indoors to drain or just go to one site and drain in space. I lost to Matt Ehrhart&#8217;s speeder deck because of some early battles he won. Just try to win every battle by not spreading and get some guys up in space. Visage may hurt a bit.<br>
<br>
Vs. Space<br>
Save up for beatdown. Use Search and Destroy and Visage. Drains on ground will add up quickly. When time is right, you should have some tracked 5&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s and drop a few of your ships to kill them. Easy unless they have some cool tech. Sniper any undercover guys.<br>
<br>
Vs. WYS<br>
Hold the docking bays and put pressure on them at Tatooine. Watch for portals and Patrol Craft reacts. Sit in Cantina with guys and drain for huge ammounts. Guri goes somewhere, probably space to control Tatooine. Don&#8217;t duel, just toss those. Visage will most likely be dead. Hard matchup. Play smart. Play I Have You Now to get rid of Luke.<br>
<br>
That&#8217;s it. Real simple. If you have ever played Hunt down in your life, you can win with this.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
