Why do I never see people play DS II any more? It is most definitely the shiznit! I would make a bold statement by saying this goes beyond all metas, no matter what. I mean come on!? Any deck that does direct damage of three a turn without occupying or controling anything is most definitely the shiznit! Not even taking into account the MASSIVE activation this deck generates extremely early. Huge drains and damage and even a couple of potentialy huge beatdowns as well! I love it. Please read the strategy and review with true insight, not bull crap comments. I&#8217;d appreciate it, Thanx!<br>
<br>
<br>
******STRATEGY******<br>
<br>
-Early Game- you get your death machine running pretty fast. Use IAO to get DS II Docking Bay, deploy Jerjerod and go get the first sector and draw up whatever force left that the opponent gave you (don&#8217;t be affraid of beatdown on Jerjerod alone at the DB cause he doesn&#8217;t allow spies to deploy there). Go get your We Shall Double Our Efforts with Twi&#8217;lek or WMEOPlans. Third turn at the latest you&#8217;ll have your death bringer assembled and ready to go. Now how you go from here depends on the opponent. If they are playing WYS or QMC, move the death star 2 to their system to start pressuring them. Build up your forces there after you beat them down (remember DS 2 says you add a battle destiny to DS 2 system and system it orbits).<br>
<br>
-Mid Game- if you look at this deck for five seconds you will say &#8221;Man dude, this deck will totally dominate space if you want it to&#8221;. This is key. It will make the opponent scared of coming up in the air or they may try to spread with hyper escapes and all that cancel battle crap. WELL THAT&#8217;S WHAT THE SENSES ARE FOR! Sense is huge in this deck! It&#8217;ll stop hyper escape, power pivot, on target, and all that other space @#$% that can screw your beatdowns. Just as they think they&#8217;ve screwed you, you screw &#8217;em right back and sense the bull crap. Sense will also help with Path, Sorry About The Mess, Darklighter Spin, Control/TV, etc. Sense rules and may SAC never die. YOU WILL dominate space! If you&#8217;re affraid of establishing a foothold on the ground, then just block their drains on the ground wit your undercover dudes. <br>
<br>
-Late Game- your damage from drains and beats and Death Star will take toll on your opponents. Someone once told me &#8221;your beatdowns in space just won&#8217;t happen to a good hidden base deck&#8221;, and I said &#8221;okay you are full of shiznit you sheep herding stone age pot smoking homo @#$% boy&#8221;. This will either beat them out of space or drain them out. Do you have any idea how huge a tracked Gravity Shadow is? That card alone can win this game for me!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*****MATCHUPS*****<br>
<br>
-QMC- what a joke. DS 2 was made to kill decks with one planet as their platform. Move your death bringer to Bespin and pile on beatdowns staring Executor, Guri, Zuckuss, Lat Damage, Thrawn, Imp Command, etc. Once you&#8217;ve so easily taken their system, undercover spies to block their drains and Sense their Sorry About the Messes that try to kill &#8217;em. If Corran comes down to try to get them uncovered save your forces for a beatdown. You will rape this deck.<br>
<br>
-WYS- same. Again I repeat, DS 2 was made to kill decks with one planet as their platform. Use undercover spies to block ground drains. Lat damage Outrider before they can stop you and beatdown everything in space. You will totally devaste them if you play smart. Easy win.<br>
<br>
-LSC- DO NOT GO DOWN TO PICK A FIGHT ON NABOO! your drains and direct damage will be WAY higher than their drains. Oh yeah, and by the way, Guri and Stinger totally and utterly piss on super falcon so eat it. Their space is so minimal there will be no chance or they will commit suicide. The drain race will take awile, but you will (9 times out of 10) prevail. Good game, you&#8217;ll win.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----So TELL ME what ya think?------<br>
Many have fallen to the outright power and solidity that this deck provides and it is quite the mainstay in any meta. Try it and I guarantee you&#8217;ll love it! Keep playing and have fun!<br>
<br>
STAR WARS CCG FOREVER DUDES... yeah.<br>
