There is no try/oppressive enforcement is in there because It`s so much better than the defensive shields. There are 2 tatooines in there for sunsdown. Try and get them out and all of your spys deploy for free which is most of them.<br>
<br>
Hutt influence is the best card. The opponent won`t be able to cancel your drains or modify them where you have 2 aliens and your force drains are big. 2 lightsabers to enhance them, the locations add to them, the objective makes it +1 where you have an isb agent. Even expand the empire on a location where it says +1 will be even more and the opponent can`t do anything about unless they kick you off. Drop can recycle your cards and death mark is even more direct damage.<br>
<br>
For battling you`ve got the hard dark jedi and Mara jade, the emperor can zap people to death. Imperial arrest order makes your imperials of ability less than 3 forfeit +2. Use imperial barriers to stop hard light side characters from coming down. Dark jedi presence makes your imperials double the power, and you can retrieve force with the objective, destroyed homestead makes them lose 1 force a go. You can recycle cards with drop. U-3PO and Keder the black can cancel the opponents force drains.<br>
<br>
<br>
-vs- there is good in him<br>
start out by getting your sites out with neimodian advisors. Try and get tatooine and sunsdown, then you can just deploy people for free. Setup up your drains and use U-3PO and Keder the black to cancel their force drains. Your force drains will be quite a lot and try to get tatooine occupation for some direct damage. Retrieve with your objective. If they do come down use imperial barriers and you are beaten to exclude their characters. If they have got a Luke stuck at endor play destroyed homestead to make them lose 1 force a go. <br>
<br>
-vs- light side combat<br>
start out like usual getting your sites out and get sunsdown to deploy characters for free. Try and go over there with vader and maul to stop their objective. Get your drains going with your aliens and hutt influence so they can`t cancel your force drains. Tatooine occupation is a big card making them lose force. Play destroyed homestead on Luke or obi wan to make them lose more force.<br>
<br>
-vs- senate<br>
start out as always getting your sites out. It depends where their play their characters if you go down their and beat them up or just setup your really big drains on tatooine. Usually they will come down and have a go at your characters. Use imperial barriers to stop their characters and you are beaten to exclude one. Dark jedi presence will make your power huge and lightsabers will be able to chop people and cut their forfeit.<br>
<br>
-vs- profit<br>
You can deploy 2 aliens snoova and Mara jade are a must, both can get their weapons from reserve deck which is brilliant and both really powerful, next turn you can back it up and start setting up elsewhere.<br>
Play your defensive shield secret plans to slow down their retrieval and play allegations of corruption to grab one of their interrupts. Profit usually uses quite a lot of interrupts. Use U-3PO and Keder the black to cancel their force drains and you can retrieve with your objective. Play imperial barriers to slow down their characters. They will lose force for playing sense if they do. Try to outdrain and battle them. If they play podracing play the defensive shield to limit the damage.<br>
