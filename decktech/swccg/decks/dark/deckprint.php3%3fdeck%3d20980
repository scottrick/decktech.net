<br>
try and get yout systems and docking bays out quickly.the executer deploys minus 5 at fondor,so deploy it there,and shuddle up piett and merjhk as pilots.<br>
<br>
next try and flip your objective,and get decree set up.wherever your oppenet is try and get 5d6 down.he is the best to get on their planet because he can only be killed by sorry about the mess.<br>
<br>
by now you should have been able to get chireniu out with a command.he lets you drain for plus 1 when he is aboard a star destroyer at same system and any system within 2 parsecs that also has a destroyer.set up big drains with him,and lock down your oppenent<br>
<br>
<br>
now for match ups.<br>
<br>
against wys try and get your ships out fast.limit them to one destiny with commands.use tie guns to kill their star fighters.lateral damage for dash.get 5d6 down on tatooine,and set up decree<br>
<br>
agaisnt qmc taking over bespin is the best bet.get 5d6 down,and set up decree.drain them for alot at bespin,and probaly atleast 1 other system,while limiting them to no drains.use tie guns and kill their fighters.<br>
<br>
lightsaber combat will be kinda ruff.it is very fast setting up drains.agaisnt them put your spaceport docking bay down on naboo,and get 5d6 set up in a blizzard walker so they cant battle him.set up decree and drain for alot in space.they can only get 2 a turn drain after that.<br>
<br>
agaisnt throne room rely on your heavy space package.a throne room deck ont have many ships.use your imperial commands and lateral damage to fend off their ships.anti sac shields will probaly help alot.set up big space drains.watch out for spies to your docking bay early on.<br>
<br>
agaisnt hidden base,probe their base.rely on huge power to beat up their ships.and the tie guns will also help alot.<br>
<br>
<br>
thanks for reviewing my deck.it had done very well for me in my last 4 tournaments.only losing 1 game to qmc because they took over space.it was jsut a really bad draw,i played him after the tournament and beat him pretty handely.have fun with the deck </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
