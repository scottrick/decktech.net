Your starting is of course the throne room, your destiny, insignificant rebellion, mobilization points i.a.o and any other effect depending on what they're playing.<br>
Against TIGIH start Battle Order nad get Luke asap. Most people leave a lonely guy at the home one docking bay, so get mara and a squad and slaughter. watch for speeders or eloms they could give you problems. this should be a good game.<br>
Against Ops start Leave Them To Me, this game will be over before it begins. now their objective is useless so theyll be coming to you. battles should be easily won with destiny and weapons.<br>
Against MWYHL start Oppresive Enforcement, sense and alter thier cards, it'll help, especially before they filp because then theyre useless. this game will be tough especially if they test to 6, win battles early on that way if they do win duels, you'll be able to convert luke. get CHYBC early to stop retrieval, and that should help you win battles if they want thier force back.<br>
Against Profit start battle order to slow drains once they flip, youll want them to spread thin and it could help you to win battles. sense and alter everything they throw at you. this should be a good game also. try to grab han and force lightnin and young fool him.<br>
Against RTP start Battle Order to slow drains when they rescue leia. sense and alter everything and kill leia. try to force lightning and young fool her, then game over.<br>
Your default effect should be oppresive enforement, just because its a good card especially with the dreadnaughts and they might throw a surprise sense or alter at you. You could also start You Cannot Hide Forever, whichever your preference. If there are any questions please feel free to ask. Give me some pointers on what to leave in and what to take out. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
