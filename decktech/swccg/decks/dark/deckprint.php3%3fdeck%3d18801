2 watto&#8217;s is plenty. As many anti battle cards as are in here, he shouldn&#8217;t die, and if he does, you always have the Kintan strider to get him back again.<br>
Also, if they use 8 force to send him into the used pile, JANUS plus the ability to track = watto within 2 turns again. Or attack next turn and retrieve with First strike. No problems getting watto out and keeping him there. <br>
<br>
As to the EPP Mauls, I have won two of them thus far. Maybe if you slackers try out closed environment, you might win some too. But yes, as soon as decipher actually sends the winners thier cards, I will have plenty. I wouldn&#8217;t play them if I hadn&#8217;t won them. Thats why only 2 in the deck.<br>

END UPDATE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
basically you play this with the same mindset as speed deal. flip first turn with watto + some cheap guy, deal damage. first grab executor with mob combo, then sac it to get S&D. also, grab the executor DB, unless you can play establish contol rith then. Wipe Then Out lets you activate 1 on the opponents turn, so yuo get to barrier/ search for ghhhk every opponents turn. also gets around I did it. Lots of damage. Also, the epp mauls can be subbed by tatooine mauls, or more cut vaders. all they are is pest control :)<br>
<br>
Matchups are all pretty much the same, as you deal tons of fast damage (3 on your first turn!), so they should be reacting to you. You can set up Establish Control and Occuption. Commands set that up, or get ozzel for quick flip, or whatever. Kintan strider is cool, as it enhances your beat down. <br>
<br>
NOTE: if you are not a rules lawyer or think kintan is crap do the following: play 1 more watto, 1 more epp vader, and throw in emperor.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the low detail, but the deck plays itself. the only hard part is chossing what to put down to make them lose to the obj. :)<br>
<br>
Have fun and enjoy!<br>
<br>
if you have any questions, IM me or email. Don&#8217;t give the deck a bad review just cause you didn&#8217;t see a matchup you wanted to. just ask, as there are WAY TOO MANY matchups right now. Not saying this is the best deck, but its fun and fast, and will win you tournys   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
