On your starting hand you probably will have Neimodian Advisor or We must... (it&#146;s great when you have both) so you can get another location on table, you also pull docking bay out and 3rd marker too, so on your second turn you will have 6 (worst case) to 10 (best) activation, but it&#146;s without activation from oponent locations. You will probably also have imperial Command on table, so use the first to get Ozzel. That way you should be able to get one walker(imperial walker or Blizzard 4 are the best to do so) at plains and, if you played Neimodian Advisor on the first turn, star destroyer (Dominator) on Hoth.<br>
If you didn&#146;t get good starting hand (without anythink to pull thelocations) try to track these cards when searching for docking bay.<br>
It&#146;s also important to deploy Ice storm as soon as possible it will make controling three Hoth sites much easier, and when you do this just play walker garrison (even if played only once it should be enough to win).<br>
Only problem is Menace fades, there&#146;s no good way of dealing with it, or at least I don&#146;t know it, maybe you can help me. Only thing I can do is to try to win the space.<br>
That&#146;s about all there is, so please review me kindly :)<br>
Thanks for reading<br>
