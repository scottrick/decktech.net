This deck has never let me down. It can beat such a wide variety of decks, making it a good choice to take to a tournament.<br>
<br>
This is designed to counter most degenerate crap and drain and battle its way to victory. This deck is easy to play, but when played by a skillful player, it is really hard to overcome. It takes most HB and MWYHL decks, it will beat Ops with Bright Center, and will take down most Throne Room decks.<br>
<br>
<b>Some Strategy Notes:</b><br>
*<i>SAC still works in Hunt Down decks, as there are plenty of 1’s in the deck.</i> <br>
*<i>Two 4-LOM’s to slow down Ben Kenobi. IG-88 is the man with Reactor Terminal down, as you can set up all kinds of destinies not only for his weapon, but the destiny he adds when with a bounty hunter.</i><br>
<br>
<b>MATCHUPS</b><br>
<b>Vs. HB:</b> <br>
Start Sec. Precautions. Use ships to probe and set up some quick drains. Once you probe, the game is virtually over in most cases.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Throne Room:</b><br>
ALWAYS start Crush. These games will be the most enjoyable, as its mains versus mains. You Are Beaten is a game-changing card...Against Revo, you have the Crush and 2 Evaders, plus JP, the AC, and the Death Star - all immune to Revo.<br>
<br>
<b>Vs. Ops</b><br>
Start Secret Plans or Security Precautions if they give up only one Force so you can deploy a first turn Vader at the Farm. Get on their turf quickly. Keep chasing them around with the big guns, and spread out elsewhere for drains. I have since added Battle Order, but it is only really effective against Speeder Ops. <br>
<br>
<b>Vs. MWYHL</b><br>
Start Secret Plans again. Retrieval is big around here, and I have to be cautious. Fast drains coupled with big activation will hurt, even with Battle Plan down. And prepare for the EPP beatdown with your Ghhk and a laugh.<br>
<br>
<b>Cards To Consider:</b><br>
<i>Tempest 1 and Igar:</i> Great powerhouse combo.<br>
<i>Search And Destroy:</i> for HB and #s. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Track Record:</b></u><br>
This was my deck of choice after the Ops frenzy subsided. I used it for the better part of a year following the release of Special Edition. It accumulated a surprisingly good record, but was retired after a lackluster 1-2 performance at the 2000 Texas State Championship. It’s overall record was somewhere around 35-3.<br>
