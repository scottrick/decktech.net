Sorry about the HTML tags, you&#8217;d think writing this in Notepad then pasting online would circumvent that nuisance, but apparently not.<br>
__________________________________________<br>
Paul Myers sent me his version of this deck, which I basically just tweaked my original to include the best parts of his, and added the UC spy. It&#8217;s 10 cards different, not 5, Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
Start: (9 cards on table)<br>
Hunt Down<br>
Med. Chamber<br>
Holotheatre<br>
Visage Of The Emperor<br>
Epic Duel<br>
Podrace Arena<br>
Sebulba&#8217;s Podracer<br>
Boonta Eve Podrace<br>
(effect)<br>
<br>
Almost always start Watto&#8217;s Box, unless you&#8217;re playing against a WYS podrace deck that you absolutely know will win the race. Against that, start Secret Plans. Masterful Move for the Holotable ASAP, get a hologram there to start draining. Hold one Holonet Transmission in hand for the pesky Trans. Term. that you will see in 9 of every 10 light decks, and EVERY WYS deck.<br>
<br>
Against a dedicated racing deck you&#8217;ve got the 4 Pod. Collisions, Unexpected Interruption to go fetch one, No Escape to grab one back after you&#8217;ve played it, and a Twi&#8217;lek to get THAT. This, and grabbing Too Close for Comfort, will help you win the race if you need to.<br>
<br>
If they don&#8217;t try to win the race and are saving force, they&#8217;ve got It Could Be Worse in hand. Hold off on winning if possible until you have Ommni Box/It&#8217;s Worse in your hand. If you&#8217;re playing against a SAC deck, try to be flipped so they can&#8217;t Sense your OB/It&#8217;s Worse. Vader can cut any Jedi with the sick destiny in here. If they Blaster Deflection, try again next turn, they&#8217;ve only got ONE.<br>
<br>
If they do It Could Be Worse the damage and you can&#8217;t prevent them playing their Sense(s) then just It&#8217;s Worse for about half the force you have activated, let them Sense that one, then do it again with the other It&#8217;s Worse for the other half of your force pile. Only a deck with like 5 Senses and crappy destiny will take no damage from the race.<br>
<br>
After the race is won, and they&#8217;ve lost their 11, you have a couple strats against different decks. Okay, it&#8217;s the same against almost every deck. Find your dueling cards, slay (or cross) an Obi or Luke, respectively. Find your ships, take over a system. Maul controls a scrub-occupied site, Mara gets in the cracks where nobody else can go (Throne Room, War Rooms, etc.) Emperor sits at a high-traffic site, preferably with backup and zaps the sh!t out of anyone foolish enough to come near.<br>
<br>
Are they out-activating you with a load of Revos? Image of the Dark Lord in a key place.<br>
<br>
Not sure if they have dueling protection? Or just paranoid about that one card they keep in their hand? Take a peek w/Monnok.<br>
<br>
This deck is great fun because not only can scrub smugglers not keep up (shut up Girard!), the Jedi have a hard time as well.<br>
<br>
Okay I guess this is where I should explain my loss to Girard&#8217;s Watch Your Phil deck. I won the race, I crossed Luke, I was flipped most of the game. I got the bastard down to 7 life force. Then the Lars Family and their friendly Palace Raider decide to kick my ass. I never saw No Escape this game, so Honor prevented 2 from the race, 2 from the duel, and every force drain at the Holotable except ONE. Also, with my force generation cut, I couldn&#8217;t draw enough to find Maul OR any of the 3 ships. But if I keep whining, he&#8217;ll call the Waaa-mbulance, so that&#8217;s how I lost to him by 32. The next day in a friendly rematch game, he didn&#8217;t get Honor out as quickly, and I beat him by 27. So the deck has difficulty sometimes but it&#8217;s not an auto-loss against Watch Your Phil, or any other stupid WYS deck. I might just have to add another Twi&#8217;lek to get No Escape earlier. F*cking Honor Of The Jedi. I love/hate that card.<br>
<br>
So there you go, race, duel, have fun, and don&#8217;t forget to drain at the Holotable.     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
