Basically you just set up shop on endor, and get your AT-STs and Biker Scouts there (use the non-unique one to get their bikes for them). Just do your best to flip the obj ASAP. Other than that, the deck mechanics are pretty self-explanatory (D-MAIL ME FIRST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!)<br>
<br>
Now for some cards i chose, and why.<br>
<br>
Kuat + Kuat Drive Yards -- like we&#8217;re in attack position, only it lets you pull out the ISDs too. pretty cool combo.<br>
<br>
Imperial Command -- can pull Chiraneau, piett and ozzel... and it kills the superfalcon.<br>
<br>
merrejk + chiraneau -- merrejk pull the systems for you, and chiraneau adds to the drains! drains of +3 (at systems with drains of 2 already) are EASY!<br>
<br>
Sarkli -- god of the 2/2 scrubs, nuff said<br>
<br>
Jendon -- adds 3 to power and 1 to manuever of ANYTHING he pilots, that means Zuckuss in MH is safer(in response to a review, note the &#148;R&#148; on the end of the word safe, he isnt 100% safe, but i havent see X wing cannons in a long time)  from X wing cannons, and he is good with IAO<br>
<br>
Ozzel + Piett -- make your SDs cheaper to deploy, and are also great for adding to power and getting a battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Biker Scouts -- they can be lost to drains then retrieved the next turn, and that can really help alot. plus they rock when on their bikes.<br>
<br>
Trample -- why explain? its just too good of a card, espically with so make walkers<br>
<br>
Empire&#8217;s New Order -- good force retrieval<br>
<br>
<br>
VS Deck Types:<br>
<br>
Profit -- just try to set up fast, and drain like mad. send vader/tarkin and the AT-ATs in to kill han. that should stall them long enough to make the drains hurt them enough to cripple their deck.<br>
<br>
MWYHL -- probably the hardest matchup because of JT1. load up bossk in bus, and send down vader and tarkin, and just cream luke and/or yoda. if that doesnt work, drain on endor, since they cant hurt your drains there.<br>
<br>
QMC -- i havent played this, as it isnt big around here, but i would suggest setting up, and sending in the old vader/tarkin combo to bust stuff up. controlling bespin is the key.<br>
<br>
TIGIH -- capture luke if you cant, and if you cant, dont worry, it doesnt matter that much, but capturing really gets that force choke on them. if they are playing there is good in ewoks, try to get empires new order out, and retrieve lotsa force. get your groove on in space, and drain, like always.<br>
<br>
EBO -- tough. space battles are iffy, so dont forget that they cant draw more than one battle destiny (with you obj). try to stay less spread out (definetly hold sullust, kuat and endor, the others are optional)<br>
<br>
ok, thats about it. if you dont understand something, dont rate it low, all the cards in here have a purpose, and i can tell you why, so just d-mail me, i will reply to ALL d-mail send about this. and dont forget that just because i am not clint hays, or brian hunter, that this isnt a good deck. a small name doesnt always mean a small deck! thanks for your time!<br>
