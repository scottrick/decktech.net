Mara’s Saber  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First off, here is my sermon. <br>
This is quite possibly the most versatile deck type out there. With tons of direct damage and the extra possiblity of huge drains, there is quite a good chance of winning. I mean, with No Escape and Code Clearance out, there is practically no way to cancel the direct damage and no way to do retrieval circles. <br>
Profit? Wow I do alot more damge than you will ever do. <br>
MWYHL? uh, broken (concentration). <br>
EBO? Only 5 hoth sites needed you say? and Imperial decree?  BTW, not too many EBO decks around here have enough ground power to deal with walkers breathing down their necks. <br>
AITC? Yeah, right.  Hah.  That&#8217;s funny just thinking about it. <br>
MBO? Hah.  I used to play this, it&#8217;s not that hard to beat lol. <br>
Senate? how much damage can they REALLY do? <br>
Honor? No Escape and Presence, yep.<br>
Hidden Base?  Ok so you only lose 10+ every turn instead of 17.  Oh well.  And they can&#8217;t cancel the direct damage w/ the obj.<br>
Endor Bunker? Well, THEORETICALLY this can cause problems, as they dump my hand and get to beef up their characters and their drains.  However, the one bunker deck I have played wit this I beat by garrisoning the heck out of them.<br>
QMC? Let&#8217;s see.  I have imp decree, they have menace fades (if they don&#8217;t they&#8217;re dead anyways:).  I have direct damge and honor stoppers, they have, uh, drains(which I have too, BTW).  Against a GOOD player, might be hard but otherwise I think I&#8217;m fine.<br>
WYS?  Might be hard, but I can stop the kessel run retrieval and I can outdrain them.  And trust me, with imperial command AND the admiral&#146;s orders, battling will not be a big problem.<br>
<br>
Well there aren&#8217;t a whole lot of other dominant deck types out there.  Of course, this deck won&#8217;t go undefeated forever. There is always someone, but YMSYL is definately one of the most solid choices available. <br>
Well, that&#8217;s my ten cents. <br>
<br>
<br>
PRE-ACTIVATION <br>
Pull executor, 3rd marker, and walker garrison <br>
Pull piet if you have imp command <br>
<br>
1st TURN <br>
Pull executor docking bay (preferably) after activating. Drop any sites in hand and try to get someone to the Exec: DB for mob points activation. If the camp or DDTA is out, don&#8217;t worry about it. <br>
Admiral Piett, both AT-STs, Mosep, General Veers, and Rachalt Hyst can all be deployed to a DB first turn with only your force.  Draw any remainder <br>
<br>
LATER ON.... <br>
Drop guys and AT-ATs to 3rd marker, beef it up. If you feel like a wuss, put them at 5th marker, but where&#8217;s the fun in that? :) <br>
Try to get set up for walker garrison, as a few of those can make the hoth blues turn into some serious frostbite.<br>
Watch out for spies, don&#8217;t leave some scrub alone at the 5th marker.  Heh, first-hand experiance right here.(DOH!!) <br>
<br>
WAY LATER ON... <br>
Garrison. This card will make the game if you get to play it at all. That is why there are 4. If one makes it a close game, 2 will finish it and it is halarious to see the opponents face when you show them the third that is in your hand. The fourth is good drain fodder and also backup incase you lose too amny in a drain etc..  By end game, you should be spread out at most of your sites making them lose a heckload of force. RBO is nice, but not necessary. <br>
<br>

DECK NOTES: <br>
<br>
* Only 3 non pilots: <br>
  Mosep : who would want to lose 10+ off the top of the reserve deck??!! <br>
  J&#8217;Quille : power 6, can exclude characters <br>
  4-LOM : duh <br>
 <br>
*Drop! serves as Reactor Terminal.  You can drop 3 EVERY control phase, and it serves as a used monnok of sorts.  Only disadvantage is that it deploys for 3 instead of 1.<br>
<br>
*Death Mark is pretty funny against WYS <br>
<br>
*4 twileks to pull all the important effects, and the are VERY important indeed <br>
<br>
*Evader kills revo <br>
<br>
*Since the destiny is not all THAT great, Rachalt Hyst is good for getting rid of their high destiny interrupts floating around.  And she makes good forfeit fodder:)<br>
<br>
*Even if the drains are reduced, the direct damage and remaining drains are still quite potent and able to do some serious hurtin&#8217;.<br>
<br>
Well there ya go. Undefeated in tourney play so far, close to it in pick up games. Probably not the best version, but not too shabby. <br>
<br>
    Thx for your reviews. <br>

PS:  I forgot to put my theme song in the description:<br>
<br>
  It&#8217;s Saturday Night on Hoth,<br>
  The Sun&#8217;s-a-goin&#8217; do-own,<br>
  It sure is cold out here,<br>
  But it&#8217;s better than under a Walker foot!<br>
