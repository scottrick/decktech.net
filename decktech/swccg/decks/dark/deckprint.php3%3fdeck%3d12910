Sorry for those stupid p things i forgot the deck doesnt have to be in HTML its been a while.  Sorry again, thanks<br>
Also R-3PO should be U-3PO.  That is my mistake.<br>
M.deck.gemme<br>
**End UPdate**<br>

<br>
What this deck does, is lets you take han out of the game at the very beginning.  Getting him to the Audience Chamber is the goal.  Once you flip you simply battle, retrieve using scum, and drain.<br>
<p><br>
Start the CCT stuff, with Jabba&#8217;s Prize instead of a rebel from the opponent&#8217;s deck.  This obviously takes out han, but it also makes Jabba wicked strong (Power6, Defense Value 7, Immune <7), and the LS cannot free han with &#8217;someone who loves you&#8217;  Now for the other stuff.  No bargain is just good for keeping the rebels out.	I was going to use Mob Points to get out Carida but decided against it even though im playing mad &#8217;none shall pass&#8217;.  Power of the hutt lets me pull Boelo and Ephant Mon - these guys are both good with jabba and have other uses.  TINT/OE is obviously just to stop the Sac Attack.<br>
<p><br>
Pull Lando first turn with the Security Tower game text, and pull Ephant Mon with Power of the Hutt.  I think it would be good to get Ephant Mon to the Security Tower to protect Han.	Drop the Audience Chamber with the Objective Game text.  I thought of using IAO for the Dbays but Elis is more important to me.  Youre getting at least four force first turn so deploy Elephant Man and save the rest.<br>
<p><br>
Second Turn get Boelo and Jabba to the Audience Chamber.  What you want to do from here on in is get one of your three droids (Gury, IG, 4Lom) to han and let them get it to the audience chamber by pulling out your Dbays with the Objective.  Move Han and Ephant Mon over to the DBAY To drain.  Get mara w/ her stick to the Carbonite Chamber and chill there draining.  Let them come to you and all too easy them/weapon lev them/ whatever you have to do to take them out.  If you get a bunch of guys to the AC to hang out with Jabba protecting Han, your opponent will not go there.  If they&#8217;re draining somewhere, Elis a stack of guys there to beat down.  Xizor and Guri should obviously Stay together, you can also beatdown with snoova, the EJP bounty Hunters and Evazan/Ponda Baba.  Just battle and retrieve.  This deck can hold its own on ground.<br>
<p><br>
Now For Card Choices<br>
<p><br>
Why so little space? <Br><br>
Well, i dont really want to go to space, but if i have to I will.  Dash is the king of the Galaxy right now and I dont want to deal with him.  Go to space if you must, use Res Luk Rauf to your advantage.<br>
<p><br>
I use boba on the ground and in the air because he is just versataile.	If i had to take out some of the None Shall Passes in this deck i would put in some hidden weapons instead.  So think about that when you give me feedback.  let me know.<br>
<p><br>
Lando: you can pull him.  Keep him on cloud city and he is fine, if they try and replace him ill just smack him down.  No skin off my back.  I had lobot in here but it just wasnt worth it to me to keep him in.<br>
<p><br>
Oh Switch off:	Protects my droids who are escorting the frozen han.  Also if It is just Guri&Xizor at a site, i play that and they are both protected for the rest of the battle.  And its recyclable 6.<br>
<p><br>
Look sir Droids: I really do not want My droids getting smacked as they transport han.	This will wreck artoo&Threepio wherever they are camped out.  Thats all i have to say about that<br>
<p><br>
Main Course: Takes care of frozen @#$% which pisses me off, and also destroys Snoova.  Also the part that subtracts destiny when there is a rebel and alien isnt that bad of a use.<br>
<p><br>
None Shall Pass : Are there too many?  Let me Know.<br>
<p><br>
Omni Box/ It&#8217;s Worse : Why not?  I like recyclable 5&#8217;s.  let me know if you think there is a better one.<br>
<p><br>
Death Mark: Like i said, Dash Rendar is a diety.  This will hurt him.  Dash will be in almost every deck and in space, if i can make the opponent hurt for this, then i want to.<br>
<p><br>
Ponda Baba&#8217;s Holdout: I just like the idea of the combo card destroying many things in it&#8217;s path.  Besides there aren&#8217;t alot of other weapons in this deck to utilize Evazan&#8217;s GT.<br>
<p><br>
Vibro Ax: Snoova.<br>
<p><br>
I tried to use 5&#8217;s to make the destiny of this deck better.  I love reeyees but there arent enough 3&#8217;s in here.  All in all i just wanted to make a CCT deck with Jabba&#8217;s prize and i think it could work.  While im not the best player or deckbuilder, many of you are.  Help is appreciated.  Dmail me if you have any questions that you&#8217;re not just going to blurt out in the review.  Thanks alot.<br>
