Well heres some strategy of how this thing works.<br>
<br>
Try to get Emperor to Endor db or if last resort to death star db.  Against anything execpt EBO and Hidden Base pull out Rendilli with Mobil Points.  Try to get vader out.  if they give you luke duel them out.<br>
<br>
Combos:<br>
<br>
Gravity Shadow/Lateral:  This is cool even though its prob. already been done.	When they try to move away make the stay at the site with all your ships... deploy more guys and beat them up..<br>
<br>
Piett:	You can pull out your order or get igar and temp 1 combo going which is good.<br>
<br>
Force Lightning/Young Fool:  Cool combo though everyone does this.  It kills objs.  against MWYHL if you track correctly you can get Leia/Luke and place it outa play.	Profit kills han.<br>
<br>
Cards in here:<br>
3x Barrier:  Even with 3 I cant draw them for the life of me.<br>
<br>
Vaders Saber.  I might be taking these out cause they arent that great.  but against certian decks its good to chop a guy and draw a fairly descent destiny.<br>
<br>
stragegy<br>
<br>
Profit:  Get mara from deck to the AC.	Drop Emp to JP get maras saber and move her over for a drain of 3.  Since they prob. wont move han over (because of force lightning) drop dlots or lord to the AC and kill Han.<br>
<br>
There is good in him:  Convert their DB first turn and drop emp there.	try to get mara with her stick to chirpas hut for a good drain.  get walkers up to trample any of their guys.  use vader to get luke and start dueling him.  battle with your walkers and drain in space.  Hard match-up though.<br>
<br>
EBO:  Set up normally and drain at the DBs.  DONT deploy Rendili untill you have enough force and ships to defend it off..  Get battle order out try to attack their lone ships(if any) and get vader to a Battleground to make them lose from Your destiny.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base:  Preety Much same as above but concentrate more on dueling and probing.  Should be a fairly hard matchup but you should pull out on top.<br>
<br>
i cant think of anything else to say execpt i would like to add 1 more rise my friend, emp and some imperial commmands and some more 6s.  but you can do the tuning yourself.  if you have any suggestions or comments write them down.. but dont just say screw me becuase i only have 1 emp or it doesnt fit your playing style.  thanks late. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
