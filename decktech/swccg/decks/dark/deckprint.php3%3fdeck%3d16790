Response to Reviews:<br>
<br>
Yodamuppet: You&#8217;re right I forgot about artoo and threepio but we&#8217;ll be seeing less and less of them with the new threepio out.  I do flip before the game starts against profit because Frozen Han says I do in his gametext.<br>
<br>
Elvis: Yes you are wrong.  If someone is escorting the frozen captive they cannot pick him up.<br>

Recently I&#8217;ve been trying hard to find a dark deck that is good which I can enjoy playing i.e. not Hunt Down w/ #&#8217;s, ISB space or ROPS.  I was looking at my objectives and thinking what would work good with podracing when all of a sudden I came along an old friend of mine, Carbon Chamber Testing.  I thought about it and realized the flip side of the objective combined with podracing spells lots of fu{kin retrieval.  Also, the deck wrecks profit which is making a giant comeback.  So, thats how my idea for this deck was brought about.  I really like CCT because you completely eliminate their Han from the game plus you get some good activation to start with and you can pull sites without playing any effects i.e. IAO.  Anyways, on to the actual strategy.<br>
<br>
First turn you start the podrace and pull Lando and the audience chamber from your deck.  You should have gotten either Guri, Iggy or 4-lom in your starting hand.  If not, you will almost definitely find one when you draw.  When you get them, throw them down to pick up Han and move them over.  It is important to keep the droid by themselves so that they can&#8217;t be battled.  DROIDS CANNOT BE BATTLED WHEN THEY ARE BY THEMSELVES.  I&#8217;m just saying that because I know one fool will come and say, &#8221;dur dur, they can battle the droid and make you lose lots of force and get han back, dur.&#8221;  Once you reach the audience chamber you flip.  You get there by pulling the docking bays from your deck with the objective.  Once you flip you can retrieve one force during each of your control phases.  Aim High doesn&#8217;t hurt this because you only pay 1 force each time so it isn&#8217;t a big deal.  Your opponent can&#8217;t sorry about the mess the droid unless they already had a character at the site that you moved to, but you can just kill that character with other guys before they get to sorry about the mess.  Winning the podrace isn&#8217;t very difficult with this deck since there are 19 cards in the deck which are destiny 4 or higher and there are 3 podracer collisions and 2 hit racers to hurt them.<br>
<br>
Other than all that, set up force drains with lightsabers presence, cantina, etc.  Draining isn&#8217;t really the main focus of this deck.  It&#8217;s meant more for battling.  Keep in mind that the audience chamber lets you pull an alien.  This can help if you need mara or Dr. E or Mighty Jabba who when you flip becomes a power 6, defense value 7 with an immunity to attrition less than 7 who has all sorts of other cool abilities from his gametext. The high destinys help with battles as do a few weapons and interrupts such as I have you now, Weapon Levitation, Vader&#8217;s Anger and A Real Hero.  Here are some explanations for why I chose certain cards:<br>
<br>
Lando, Lobot, A Real Hero:  You can pull lando with the security tower.  A real hero pulls lobot.  If you have lobot and lando at the same site then they can&#8217;t replace Lando.  This means that for the rest of the game they can&#8217;t deploy their Han OR their Lando.  This completely removes 2 powerful characters from their deck.  No super falcon, no lando w/ vibro axe, no general calrissian.  It&#8217;s money.  Also, a real hero lets you add 2 destiny if you have lando in a battle on cloud city.<br>
<br>
Only 3 ships: These are the 3 most powerful ships the dark side has to offer with the exception of Executor which costs to damn much.  I only need 3 because when you flip they all become immune to attrition less than 4 and if I lose them I&#8217;ll probably retrieve them during my next turn.<br>
<br>
Blast Door Controls: An underused effect in my opinion.  It&#8217;s got destiny 5 and it cancels narrow escape and rebel barrier.  <br>
<br>
Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo: It&#8217;s a destiny 5 used interrupt that screws over nabrun leids which will see lots more play now that Insurrection and IAO are going out of style.  It also cancels Kessul Run so it messes with WYS.<br>
<br>
Cantina: It&#8217;s in there for some extra activation and its a drain 2 locations.  Maul deploys minus 2 there also.  <br>
<br>
By the way, don&#8217;t tell me I don&#8217;t activate enough with this deck becuse I can activate a total of 9 force by pulling locations, plus my starting.  And I can pull POTF with Twi&#8217;leks and I have the cantina in there.  If my opponent gives me like 1 or 2 force the whole game I should be pretty well off.  Also, in the beginning I don&#8217;t really need to spend that much force cuz I&#8217;ll just be podracing an moving my droid to the audience chamber most likely, so I can save up, even if they do play Aim High.<br>
<br>
If you have any other questions about cards, d-mail me.  <br>
<br>
Here are some strategies against popular light decks.<br>
<br>
QMC:  It may take the droid a little while longer to get to the AC but that&#8217;s ok becaue he&#8217;ll still get there fairly early in the game.  Just set up beatdowns and battle wisely.  Adapt to their strategy and conquer.<br>
<br>
RST: They have no general solo or general calrissian.  This can hurt them a good deal.  Once again, set up the beats and play smart.  <br>
<br>
Profit: This is making a big comeback as of late.  CCT with frozen Han WRECKS profit.  it completely destroys it.  YOU FLIP BEFORE THE GAME STARTS.  Also, they CAN&#8217;T play someone who loves you on frozen han.  Start Mara and probably Mighty Jabba or Dr. E at the Audience chamber.  Just keep the Audience Chamber well defended and they shouldn&#8217;t be able to free Han for a good while if not for the whole game.  This shouldn&#8217;t be a challenge.<br>
<br>
EBO or HB space: Battle wisely with the ships, which means probably waiting until after you flip.  Set up search and destroy.  Retrieve like crazy.  Spread out the drains but make sure you don&#8217;t spread out too thin.  These can be tough to beat but if you play it right, you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem.<br>
<br>
Any Mains deck: This deck is very strong in battles.  With the high destinys and the retrieval you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem.  <br>
<br>
Any Deck with Podracing: Most decks with racing will lose to this, however some may be packing extremely extremely high destiny in which case you could lose.  However, this isn&#8217;t the end of the world as you will retrieve the force that you lose with your objective.  In addition to that, just adapt to whatever other strategy they are playing.  <br>
<br>
Anything else: I don&#8217;t know, just adapt and conquer.  This deck is very versatile and should be able to handle a lot.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats my deck.  Review with sense.  As always, constructive criticism is appreciated.  Any questions, just d-mail me.  I&#8217;ll be glad to answer.<br>
