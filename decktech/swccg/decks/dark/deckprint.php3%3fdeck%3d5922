Order and pull out docking bays every turn.<br>
Deploy vader to one thats a battle ground,flip,<br>
and transit to one that's not(usually executor).<br>
Now wait for him to do something.Visage will<br>
eat him away(followed by Search and destroy)<br>
until he deploys to flip my objective or uses<br>
Trans.term.With 3 visages total and 2 masterful<br>
moves visage should always be out(or on it's<br>
way out untill he goes to the holotheatre w/guys.<br>
Big Coward and PASOA should help stop that nonsense.Simple stuff right?<br>
<br>
vs.Hidden Base(faulk/X-wing):<br>
Against faulk style beat/duel his guys off sites<br>
and kill w/Search+Destroy/Visage.You cant really<br>
win in space too good so wait for him to flip<br>
then reap the benifits of Security Precautions.<br>
The bonuses of vader at the med.chamber w/Hunt<br>
Down flipped is good also.<br>
 Against x-wings do just about the same except you usually play faster since these decks dont<br>
use too many characters.The ones they do use<br>
are usually Luke or obi so you can duel them<br>
away w/not too many worries.Mabye add Dengar in<br>
his ship if you fear this alot.<br>
<br>
vs.Speeder ops.<br>
Many would think I would die to this but I dont.<br>
Start B.O. and dont even deploy the dbs.Instead<br>
use them w/brangus to retrieve key cards.Make<br>
the farm home base(control it) and keep the<br>
visage/drains on.Remember dengar can shoot the<br>
speeders which is pretty awesome.<br>
<br>
vs.profit<br>
Forget the db's again and start crush w/mara<br>
and evezan at the Audience room.Deploy vader<br>
quickly and you now have a formidable force.<br>
keep your guys at 1 site tearing down anything in<br>
your path.Sniper has been enough for spies<br>
so far but you could add nevar Yalnl(whatever).<br>
<br>
vs.throne room mains<br>
disadvantaged?Well your supposed to be but its<br>
not really that bad.definately your hardest<br>
to play against though.Revo is scarce around<br>
here so I usually stay w/IAO.Its not like I<br>
cant find crush fast if I need it.Its too hard<br>
for me too sum up an exact strategy but I'll<br>
say this.Never duel early.Wait until late<br>
game to track high destiny and use it to seal<br>
his fate.I playtest at least once a day against<br>
this and my record is like 50-4.It can be done.<br>
<br>
vs.MWYHL<br>
I think these decks are ass and never have probs.<br>
Search and destroy,big coward and the fact<br>
he gives me 2 force at the beginning is just<br>
a few reasons.Hit and run is probably the best<br>
type and I always give it probs.<br>
<br>
vs.uhhh...<br>
 odds:torture x2(or 3,it fluctuates)<br>
 Rescue th princess(ass)<br>
 Toshe:Easier to beat than throne room.go to the<br>
station.<br>
<br>
Thats just about its.If you have any ?'s or<br>
comments just send me a message.<br>
Thanks for your time!<br>
