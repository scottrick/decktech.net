 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">&lt;b&gt; NOTE! Change one ORS for 5D6RA7, and Vader's Shuttle for Boba in Ship!&lt;/b&gt;<br>
Use Tatooine and Sunsdown for real quick force drains.	Track 0s to kill off EPPs w/ Overload.	Start IAO and fetch the two docking bays quick (obviously Tat first, and the spaceport next to it)<br>
<br>
vs Ops.  You win.  Their drains are -1 'cause of either 5d6 or another ISB on their planet.<br>
<br>
vs mains.  You win.  They are too slow, your drains are too fast, they can only apply one beating (at most) 'cause of IAO, and any they do get off will be almost killed by Overload.	Order To Engage is not a problem 'cause you can send your guys on suicide battles, killing an EPP, and retrieving yours at the end of the turn.<br>
<br>
vs Hidden Base.  You win.  Play the spaceport docking bay next to Kessel or Coruscant or Kiffex (one of their big drains) to limit that, and use use your ships to probe, but more importantly to run away, keeping battle plan satisfied.<br>
<br>
vs Y4.	You win.  You goto their sites and flip 1st or second turn ('cause you get to control 2 rebel base sites).  You can't be force choked, cause you have so many locs, and your stuff is real cheap<br>
<br>
vs Jedi Test 1.  You win through Tatooine Occupation and early big drains...Jedi Test 1 won't normally be completed to 3rd turn at the earliest, which means you should get off at least 1 (possibly two) big drains of 10 or more.  Draining for 1 at 5 sites plus 5 more for Tat Occupation is not something to be sneezed at.<br>
<br>
vs Profit.  Get Chall Bekan and an ORS out, using Chall to fetch another ORS, move outside and drain at T:JP, flipping first or second turn.  They won't be able to drain 'cause theirs are -1, and they can't beat you down 'cause Han and another main had to get to the AC to free Han.<br>
<br>
The ships were chosen so they could stay alive, and not worry about attrition.	I might consider changing the ships to capitals (Jabba's Cruiser and Bossk), thereby avoiding X-Wing Laser Cannons and allowing you to throw more peopl ein the back seat as forfeit fodder (Yularen and Evax etc. are forfeit=7)<br>
<br>
Anyway, this deck will go, as a minimum, at least 2-1 in a tournament, and normally 3-0, depending upon your competition.<br>
<br>
Have a good one,<br>
