<br>
This is the first of a new awesome deck type that can take on ANYTHING<br>
	This is a very simple but overly strong deck, capable of winning major tournaments in the right hands. I made this deck to be quick and efficient, at eliminating the opponents life force and holding more than it&#8217;s own in space and ground. I like this deck so much because of the direct damage that it inflicts onto your opponent.<br>
<br>
Starting:<br>
	Well this deck usually gets off to a very fast start, with the 6 walkers you should be more than capable of getting your game going and messing up your opponents game plan. You start Fear is my Ally, Hoth: Ice Plains, Prepared Defenses, You May Start You Landing, Imperial Arrest Order&Secret Plans, Mobilzation Points. I choose not to start You may Start Your Landing because it is not usually needed until later in the game. You want to get Executor after you draw your opening hand and you want to get the Defensive Perimeter and a Walker Garrison. You want to get a walker to the Ice Plains ASAP. Also don&#8217;t forget to get out your docking bays, Executor first and then Hoth&#8217;s. <br>
If you have walkers deploy them. If not draw until you do.<br>
<br>
Mid Game:<br>
	Well by this time you should have a few walkers on the table. Not always will you be with your garrison game plan, sometime you may be taking the fight to your opponents site while they eat the Direct Damage of the walkers that are at Hoth. You want to completely disrupt your opponent even if through force drains, Direct Damage, or Battle Damage, just hurt your opponent because this deck deals out the beats.<br>
<br>
Late Game:<br>
	You opponent should be very low on force now that you have made him lose mondo force may it be through any of the ways you have available. Try to finish off your opponent as fast as possible because then they have a chance to do some damage which isn&#8217;t wanted because this deck doesn&#8217;t usually win by anything more that 20. <br>
<br>
Card Choices:<br>
	Emperor Palpatine: holds a site with Iggy. Is destiny 6, can zap opponents characters and does his job nicely<br>
	Maul with Saber: Can you say hit and run?<br>
	Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter: adds destiny all day. May it be in space with 4-lom on Zuckuss in Mist Hunter or on the ground with Iggy.<br>
	Dr. Evanzan & Ponda Baba: add 3 to ANYTHING they pilot. Power 6 and draw destiny by themselves.<br>
	Stinger and Guri: add destiny and make it to where your opponent only draws one.<br>
	Lateral Damage: good for killing the Outrider.<br>
	Sniper Combo: got a character that vader just hit? Wipe him out permeantly.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
	EBO- U own them...they won&#8217;t keep there EBO up long and there drains will be no match for them because they give you more sites you can get more drains, how convient. This Matchup is fairly simple.you don&#8217;t need to start decree for the reason you have 2 twil&#8217;leks. And u should have no problem satisfying Battle Order(defensive shield) and they will have problems! easy win.<br>
<br>
QMC- well they will play smart and probably not use any exterior sites and if they do your walkers will be free to move about. Take control of Bespin ASAP! Get your executor and GA Thrawn ASAP! If they can&#8217;t flip you will win. You also need to watch for different strategies that QMC poses. And don&#8217;t let them have the north corridor to cancel your drains at CC. Be aware that you will see Path of least resistance so only do it when you are sure you have an advantage. Drain on Hoth and you should be sitting pretty. Very Close match if played right.<br>
	<br>
Duel of The Fates-  This is a very close matchup. I have managed to beat a few by just not letting off my game plan and keeping to the direct damage and the drains. This will surely eat up most decks that rely on mains because in the process of drains they will lose mains. Just make them pay for battle order and you should be set for the win.<br>
<br>
WYS- Well they use DB&#8217;s, and Walkers like DB&#8217;s and Smugglers like Trample! Just trample and use Lat Damage to get Outrider and you should be pretty well off. Just don&#8217;t let your guard down.because smugglers deploy CHEAP! So you will have alot in a little amount of time. Just play hard and smart and  you will pull off the win.<br>
<br>
Profit- well stick Mara and Dr E in the Chamber and get them to JP first turn and drain for 3 until they do something about it. Back them up with Walkers and setup up the COLD DRAINS on Hoth.I suggest using the power portion of your deck and Battle Order to stop your opponent cold.Vader will be very handy and so will Mara. Just make sure Ben dies and doesnt come back,or bring anybody back with him.<br>
<br>
TIGIH-nobody even plays this anymore. But your drains will  outnumber whatever they could or want to do to you...you will have a free drain in space...unless they pack starships which is very unlikely. And the exterior sites they are bound to use is a haven for your walkers. Just make sure Maul strikes down Like so there is no way for them to pull off any win.<br>
<br>
RST- Occupy the bunker and drain. Kill madine early and crush there scouts to little pieces. Stop there boom session so the will not be able to blow the bunker. Keep on them and keep your 3 sites occuppied with walkers if possible, and use your extras to bring the fight to them. This is a very winnable matchup.<br>
<br>
Senate- There is many senate variations and I can&#8217;t take into account what everyone does just play with your senses. And expect the unexpected. All I know is that most of your Admirals and Generals Politics +2 so u can beat down on lone senators.<br>
<br>
Well I hope you build or buy this deck, because it is a blast to play and in consistently wins. I hope you have as much fun with this as I do.<br>
<br>
Later 217.<br>
