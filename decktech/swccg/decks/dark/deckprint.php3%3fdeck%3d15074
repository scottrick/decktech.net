                      First of all this is a semi-fun, but meant to be tourney usable deck, I felt like a change. <br>
<br>
                      The third effect you start with all depends on the type of deck your playing against, the<br>
                      default effect is most likely Battle Order, it dosen’t really matter. <br>
                      If your up against MWYHL or WYS start with Secret Plans, if playing EBO start Imperial<br>
                      Decree. <br>
<br>
                      Before you activate pull out Gall. Deploy Palpy to Endor: DB, sure you may say<br>
                      he’s open for a beatdown and if you’re the kind of person that is<br>
                      cautious then put him at D*2: DB, but I like to have a force drain on my second turn, also<br>
                      you can pull Force Lightning to protect him, and you may even get Sim, Janus or a<br>
                      Projective Telepathy in your hand. <br>
<br>
                      The deck is simple, BEATDOWN!, if your opponent is chicken @#$% just sit and drain at<br>
                      all your locations, TK-422? No problem, Trample, Han-ish pancake. <br>
<br>
                      Now you may be thinking Visage Of Palpy? Well here is why, first of all, I want to try<br>
                      something intuitive, using the exact same deck for too long just gets boring. You use<br>
                      Masterful Move to first pull the Holotable, then get out Visage and deploy it there like a<br>
                      character, this will give you an almost gauranteed drain of 1 the rest of the game, you<br>
                      may be thinking just 1 isn’t much, but it will slowly but surely eat away at your<br>
                      opponent. Also if your opponent gets sick of it, they may deploy Projection Of Luke<br>
                      there, and battle to get rid of Visage, fine you have a good chance of winning that battle<br>
                      and that’s another card stacked under Insignificant Rebellion. Not only all that<br>
                      but Visage is a great destiny, Well-Earned Command makes the drain at the Holotable 2<br>
                      and it adds to destinies on Igar. If anybody says that this can’t be done, since<br>
                      Visage says deploy on Holotheatre or Conference Room, then you need to read the<br>
                      Glossary under Dejarik Rules. NB: in the end game you can increase your differencial by<br>
                      one (not much, I know) by taking Visage back into hand from the Holotable, and using<br>
                      Reactor Terminal. <br>
<br>
                      Also very small tech - If you so require, at one stage in the game take Visage into hand<br>
                      from the Holotable, use Janus to track you a nice healthy 7. <br>
<br>
                      Do, Or Do Not/Wise Advice is no big issue, you just have to be careful with Sense &amp;<br>
                      Alter, only use them when it comes to the crunch and you absolutely have to. <br>
<br>
                      Arica is cool because you place her at a site with Dr. E’s gun, break cover and<br>
                      take out a site, don’t be dumb and do this at a site that has Luke, JK. You can,<br>
                      however, have other people at the site, so when Arica breaks cover, she can’t<br>
                      be beaten down on, but that sort of defeats the purpose. <br>
<br>
                      Three Vader’s are enough for the deck, I always get them within time, and you<br>
                      shouldn’t rely on Vader, what if Luke, Rebel Scout gets to him? <br>
<br>
                      Against major decks: <br>
<br>
                      MWYHL: Gall is in here for that very deck, since it has a parsec of 9, you can deploy the<br>
                      Hound’s Tooth there, load it up, and move on out to Dagobah. There you will<br>
                      find Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me... err, or maybe you would just prefer to<br>
                      kick the little green elfs head in. <br>
<br>
                      Profit: Deploy Jade and Xizor there at the start, when your turn begins, deploy Palpy,<br>
                      Jade’s Saber and take Force Lightning into hand, secure? I think so. Then get<br>
                      everthing you have and crawl all over Tatooine. Beat down on those who stand in your<br>
                      way. <br>
<br>
                      EBO: Start Imp. Decree and have a camp out on Hoth, beautiful Summer weather<br>
                      isn’t it? <br>
<br>
                      WYS: Start Secret Plans, and smuggle your goons around to take out their smugglers. <br>
<br>
                      TIGIH: There was never good in him and there never will be! You beat on them, they<br>
                      beat on you, tough, but the Darkside always has more power.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
