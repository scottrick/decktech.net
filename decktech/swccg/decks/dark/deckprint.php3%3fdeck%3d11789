<br>
The first thing you must do before you activate is get Rendili - then after you activate look for a Docking Bay (preferably the Generic one) then also check to see if Ephant Mon is in your deck get him w/Power Of The Hutt and drop him first @ the HoloTheater (to prevent the spies from comin&#146; in and cancellin&#146; Visage)<br>
Second turn, get the other Docking Bay and (hopefully there will be some characters in hand) drop them @ the DB and activate more...continue to repeat process.<br>
<br>
Do not duel till you have a Lightsaber and a Focused Attack (get the extra D) then win. W/the destinies in this deck you could almost do a blind TCINC or VO and win. But why chance it.<br>
<br>
The space is meager, but it does the job, Dengar to cancel Immunity, Zuckuss for the ability and Bossk for the extra Destiny. This is usually enough since Space isn&#146;t your forte&#146;, however S&D @ Tatooine is w/the biggies just sitting there and waiting.<br>
<br>
Against most decks this deck will do it&#146;s damage in kind, however against Space (a little problem if it&#146;s hard core) drop your ships @ the bigger drain sites and go from there...track well, and make him loose alot (fortunately you have the destiny again if you mis track) and their S/A is +4, or can&#146;t if flipped so that helps when they try to run.<br>
Against most ground decks this will cause them to either come to you, and get beat, or you go to them, and beat them. It used to have a DJP but I dropped that for something else, cause I realized that I don&#146;t keep to many characters together anymore because of all the ability 4 characters to move about.<br>
<br>
Keep the Janus/Emperor combo going (if you don&#146;t know what that is then check my SUH-WEET BHBM deck for that combo - and rate that one as well)<br>
<br>
Other than that this deck should pose a problem for most lightside decks nowaday because lightside is such a up in the air situation (noone knows what to play anymore)<br>
<br>
Good luck and please rate respectfully.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
