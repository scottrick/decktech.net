The trick is to stop the early choke and get out some of the other locations. If you suspect a Revolver or No Shelter variant, start Imperial Justice on the Meditation Chamber. I know that the opponent could revolve the Holotheater and cancel Visage but they are taking a chance if they do.<br>
<br>
Against Hidden Base, start with Security Precautions. Get your locations down as quickly as possible but avoid deploying the systems.  If they give you the opportunity for a beatdown, take it. Vader in the Shuttle is a nasty surprise if they leave 4 ability at a system.<br>
<br>
Against Opps, start Battle Order and go fight. Between Tramples, Snipers, You Are Beaten, Bubo and Dr E., you should be able to either prevent a flip or hurt them badly even if they do flip.<br>
<br>
Secret Plans is a good choice to start against most other deck types. Remember to use the game text to get out Shocking Revelation each turn. Scan your reserve deck carefully. Then you will know whether you want to draw from your force pile or use the force and wait for something better.<br>
<br>
Against Mind What You Have Learned, if you think theyll try to train through test 5 go to the Dagobah System. Land Vader and Tarkin. Kill Luke or Leia if possible before he flips.  Also use Come Here You Big Coward to make them come out to play before they can retrieve. If they are only going to Test 2, you have plenty of ability to play with and some good tricks too. Dr. Evazan and Disarmed is one my favorites. Boba Fett, Jabba, Ephant Mon and Dr E. also make a nice strike force against a smallish group of Eloms.  With all of the Imperial Decks out there, you know we will start seeing Eloms a lot.<br>
<br>
Ephant Mon can stop spies from deploying or moving to the the Holotheater to cancel your Visage but more importantly, he protects you from the Han and other @#$%orted characters.<br>
