STRATEGY: WHAT?! <br>
<br>
This is the same deck that I made back when DS2 came out, and I used it during the DS2-Tatooine era. Of course it went through changes and all.... And, this is hopefully as close to that deck as I remember it. And of course, I&amp;#8217;ve added in some new cards for it to work well from Reflections 3, Coruscant, and Theed Palace. Anyway...... onto the strategy.... <br>
<br>
Card inclusions and why: <br>
<br>
Defensive Fire / Hutt Smooch: <br>
<br>
Always good for the protection it gives from Spies. So that little My&amp;#8217;iioom and Tech Mo&amp;#8217;Or are fine on the DS2 without Empy there {when hes off with Janus force draining}. Also, the Defensive Fire portion of this card {I randomally pick a card from opponent&amp;#8217;s hand to be placed in used pile}, works extrememly well with My&amp;#8217;iioom and the Monoks. <br>
<br>
Presence of the Force: <br>
<br>
Besides the obvious reason {get +1 activation, and a possible +1 drain}, its a good way to get Empy and Janus out first turn. <br>
<br>
Enter the Beuacrats: <br>
<br>
I don&amp;#8217;t know how to spell that stupid card, and I don&amp;#8217;t have it near me. But, this card is gold. Only taking 1D from a possible drain of 3D.... pure GOLD. <br>
<br>
Numbers: <br>
<br>
Thats right, I have the balls to throw an insert card in my deck! Lately, with the players in my area, they drop their shields like first, second, or third turn. And they have them all out. If thats the case. Their open. If I have Empy, My&amp;#8217;iioom, and Tech out, I have a total of 15. If they have their mains out, they&amp;#8217;ll have like a 3-7 total. Making them lose 5 force. Its a good one-shot. <br>
<br>
Unto the deck portion: <br>
<br>
What to do first turn? <br>
<br>
Use Mob. Points to pull Rendili. Use IAO to pull DS2: Docking bay. If you drew Janus in your opening hand, and opponent has a battleground. Pull Emy with BHBM and then drop Janus for 1. And relish in the nice drain there. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, without Janus, just drop him at the Throne Room, and pull Emperor&amp;#8217;s Power with the Throne Room. <br>
<br>
Then set-up attack runs with your characters. <br>
<br>
And use Enter the Beucrats, and U-3PO to cut-back on their drains. <br>
<br>
Agaisnt WYS: Use Vader to capture Luke. Onith should rip them a new @#$% considering that almost all of their characters are male {Melas and Mirax are the only females}, so they will probably lose a lot of characters. Then just drop Tat Maul with DB-LS, and force drain for 4 at their Cantina. And drop Empy/Janus to another site, and Force drain them for 2/3. They probably will not be able to handle this, since especially that their not going to flip. And, if they try and control Tatooine. Drop Dengar, Bossk, Zuckuss, and nullify there destiny, and immunity, and draw 2 destiny. <br>
<br>
Well.... theres the deck. If ya have any questions, D-Mail me. <br>

Defensive Shields: <br>
The 10 Best shields. Your choice. <br>
<br>
My choices:<br>
Wipe Them Out / All of them<br>
Grabber<br>
Oppresive Enforcement<br>
Battle Order<br>
A Useless Gesture<br>
Come Here You Big Coward<br>
Do They Have a Code Clearence?<br>
Fanfare<br>
You Cannot Hide Forever<br>
Yo&#146;ve Never won a Race?<br>
<br>
Reasons for shields:<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Come Here You Big Coward: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
This is perhaps the BEST shield EVER. I honestly do not think this should have been made a shield. Or at least, if this is a shield, make Honor of the Jedi a shield. But nope, thats not made.   <br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Reasons why this is so good: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
It can be gotten at any time. If opponent is about to win the podrace. Drop it, OHH... you don&#146;t retreive ANY. Suck it! Or, against like Dago-Drains or Dago-Testing, its an easy stopper. Its good in SOO many ways.<br>
<br>
Possible other inclusions in the shield area:<br>
No Escape<br>
<br>
No Escape is good, but since it doesn&#146;t really bullet Honor that well anymore, I personally don&#146;t think its worth it.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Fanfare: &lt;/b&gt;<br>
<br>
The reason Fanfare is in there is to cancel Beggar and Frozen Assets, which still comes up every now and again.<br>
<br>
The rest of the shields should be obvious. <br>
<br>
Activation issues:<br>
<br>
First turn, without the opponent&#146;s help, I am activating 3 force. Which isn&#146;t much. But, now-adays, almost everyone gives force to their opponents.<br>
<br>
So, basically, its at least 4 force first turn. Then, we use Conduct Our Search to get Endor: Back Door, and we use Imperial Arrest Order to get Death Star 2: Docking Bay. Then we use Mob. Points to get Rendilli. Then use Bring Him, to drop the Empy, either at the DS2: Docking Bay, or at the Endor: Back Door. This, gives us another force. +2 force, if he deploys to the Docking Bay, with Mob. Points working. Then, drop the Shield, Wipe Them Out, and activate 1 force on the opponent&#146;s turn.<br>
<br>
That means, second turn, we&#146;re activating:<br>
Throne Room: 2<br>
DS2: Docking Bay: 1<br>
Endor: Back Door: 2<br>
Rendilli: 2<br>
Emperor: 1<br>
Wipe Them Out: 1<br>
Yourself: 1<br>
<br>
Total:<br>
2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 Force<br>
<br>
And this isn&#146;t even taking into affect what the opponent might give you.<br>
<br>
Janus / Empy = Good lock.<br>
<br>
The Emperor and Janus can easily hold down a site, without much trouble.  <br>
Mainly, we have a total of 6 Power. Immunity on the Emperor. And the ability to Force Lightning somebody.<br>
<br>
Plus, the threat of a Barrier, Beat-down on my turn, usually holds back some threat. The Wipe Them Out, gives the opponent the allusion that I &lt;I&gt; REALLY &lt;/I&gt; need that 1 force. 1 Force Gives me, Barrier, or the ability to use the Grabber. <br>
<br>
If the opponent does try a Beat-down with Luke, and some friends. Barrier them. And make sure LUKE does not leave the battle. On your turn, drop Vader. Capture Luke, swing and kill somebody else. Flip the 7 side. And wipe out their site. Then, lose Vader to the attrition. Make &#146;em stack 1 on Insignificant Rebellion. And, flip back to the 0 side. <br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Meta&#146;ing: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
Meta&#146;ing this deck out to kick some major Whoop-Ass. <br>
<br>
Well, how can you do this?<br>
<br>
MY STYLE of play, revolves mostly around controlling the opponent, not really setting up beat downs. I play the same way in Raw Deal, L5R, and other games. Its more important to lock down the opponent and shut down their game, then play yours. <br>
<br>
The deck is set-up to play without a &quot;game&quot;. Most other players do not make a deck that has a similar practice. Most decks are designed to do the following:<br>
<br>
70% Play their Strategy<br>
10% Control<br>
20% Flounder Around when my Strategy has been killed<br>
<br>
So, based with these facts, we must think about how to control the opponent.<br>
<br>
The first step in doing so, is to realize what type{s} of deck{s} will be in your local area of playing.<br>
<br>
In my local area, my opponents play a broad-band of decks. Here are some of the decks in my local area:<br>
<br>
Rory Dibeler: LS Non-Unigue Aliens<br>
Drew Scott: Fast QMC Flip<br>
Wickey: Changes from day to day. Don&#146;t get to see him enough to notice the changes.<br>
Phill: Same with Wickey.<br>
Little Wicky: Same as big Wicky.<br>
James Leiser: He tends to make decks more towards beating Drew, so he never really notices me {PLUS!}, but usually, his decks are more aimed at BEATING DOWN whatever newest strategy Drew has come up with.<br>
Gay Steve: Hidden Base. His deck never changes. Its the same thing it has been for the last 3 years. I even think he&#146;s kept the same Hidden Base marker {Chandrilla} since Endor has come out.<br>
Mike Carr: Last I remember, he was running an RST Strike deck.<br>
<br>
Now that we&#146;ve realized their decks, we must &quot;contemplate&quot; how to counter their decks.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Rory: &lt;/B&gt; Against Rory, since he uses Chadra-Fans, their all male. And, since he does not run Goo Nee Tay. My&#146;ioom will eat him away. <br>
Plan A) Since he starts Profit, I will chose not to start any aliens, as this gives him something to beat-down with his thousands of Chadra-Fans. <br>
Plan B) He is Podracing. Or, he was at the last time I have played him. So, right here, about 4-5 cards are wasted in his deck.<br>
Plan C) Sit-Back. I know this may sound boring, but against his deck, this is the best theory. I save my force for a few turns. And drop My&#146;iioom. Then, I use My&#146;iioom to wipe out his little Aliens. Then, if he leaves a space open for me. Where he has like 2 Chadra-Fans. I drop: EPP Vader. Ref3. Fett. Mara. Her Saber. And maybe, if I have enough force, Coruscant Maul with Double Bladed. This way, I gurantee that 4 &#146;Fans are dead. ----- OR, I can just drop Tatooine Maul, so he cannot battle me. THOUGH, he does run a few mains, if I eliminate them with My&#146;iioom I have nothing to worry about.<br>
<br>
This must be how you analyze your opponents. If you analyze all of your opponent&#146;s decks this way, you have a better assessment of how to beat them.<br>
<br>
Before you begin your game, do a mental checklist of what your opponent is playing. And how to counter it. Once you have your gameplan set, go for it.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; SWITCHING: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
So you realize that you will have to change some cards in the deck to make it viable in your area? Good, your not copying my deck. I&#146;m glad to see it.<br>
<br>
I, like Defensive Fire / Hutt Smooch, as it gives me some Spy defense against them boarding my DS2 and taking over My&#146;iioom. And, it lets me get rid of a card from there hand.  <br>
<br>
This can work well in two ways:<br>
1) Use it before you use My&#146;iioom to save yourself a force.<br>
2) Use it after you use My&#146;iioom to get rid of a Female character you could not get rid of with her.<br>
<br>
But, for other players, these 3 cards may be the perfect cards to switch-in or out for their local meta.<br>
Maybe, theres alot of Lightsaber Combat decks in your area. <br>
You could throw in the Lightsaber Parry. To get rid of their guranteed 7, and make them redraw it, and its -1. Thus, usually eliminating at least 2 from their total. Which could be just enough to win the combat.<br>
<br>
OR, maybe you don&#146;t like the idea of &quot;Only&quot; controlling the opponent. So, you can get rid of them to add in more Mauls, Maras, and Vaders. <br>
<br>
It all depends on you, the player, the local meta, and your playing style. Expirement, to see what works best.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; MATCH-UPS: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
Finally, I get back to the DECK at hand, and not really the ARTICLE part of this huge post.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; WYS: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
Drop Empy and Janus in the Cantina, EARLY. Hopefully first turn. This way, you&#146;ve got a drain of 3 working there. Then, drop My&#146;iioom as quickly as possible after that. She&#146;ll be safe for the most part due to their lack of an ability to use spies/Jar Jar. And keep using her to destroy the opponent&#146;s smugglers. Once you eliminate most of the opponent&#146;s ability 3 or higher characters. Drop Tat Maul with his Double Bladed. This should hold another site. If opponent resorts to their last resort.... Space. Throw em for a loop, and drop Zuckuss, Bossk, and Fett up there, and totally annhiliate everything they do. Make sure they do not flip, because then it eliminates the usage of your Alter, and the Sense combo card.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Lightsaber Combat: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
This one will be a little bit tricky. You must hope you get rid of almost all of their jedi with My&#146;iioom. And drop Empy, Janus first turn to their 2/2 site. This way, Empy is power 5, and Janus being power 2. You will have a better chance of holding it. Only problem here is that Empy can be combat&#146;ed, but, no biggie, at most, you lose 2 force a turn, nothing to hard. These decks usually don&#146;t have to much retreival. So, if you force them to lose a good number of force, its going to be harder for them to retreive it. Also, if you can win a few key battles, this will be greatly helped because it&#146;ll force them to stack. Thus, reducing their numbers even more so, and hopefully you&#146;ll get one of their seven&#146;s. Thats basically all the hope I can give you. <br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; Mind What You Have Learned: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
This should be simple from the get-go. Just set-up your drains and go from there. The opponent will probably cancel your Janus bonus shortly. Just let the opponent deploy after a while, because he will be forced to, unless he wants to lose from My&#146;iioom. Firs turn, you activate 5 force. Second turn, you will be activating 13 force at least. Which is alot of force for this type of deck. Use My&#146;iioom to get rid of all of their EPP beat-downs. They will be left with a few characters, they&#146;ll probably deploy them after a while in the hope of being able to do something. T hats when you set-up the beatdowns and eliminate all of their forces.<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; QMC: &lt;/B&gt;<br>
<br>
This will probably be the hardest match-up for this deck. As you will not be able to beat them in space. Because Zuckuss will be killed by their X-Wing Lasers. Just attempt to minimize their drains and hope to get rid of most of their characters with My&#146;iioom. Whenever the opponent deploys a character. Instantly destroy that character with Maul/Mara/Vader. Sense or capture {or do both} with the Cloud City Run-Away card {I forget the exact card name right now}. <br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; &lt;U&gt; How to play the deck: &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/U&gt;<br>
<br>
How to play this deck is rather simple. Like I stated up earlier, start with Conduct, etc. {it says what to start in the deck section}. Then drop everything like it says in the above section. <br>
<br>
Try and get the Empy/Janus combo as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Then you must set-up the Myii&#146;oom Onith onto the DS2, as this is mainly essential for the deck to thrive.<br>
<br>
If the opponent deploys Goo Nee Tay, you must ALTER it IMMEDIATLY, or you will risk the chance of CATCHING it, and having really not protection, as My&#146;iioom is the protection for this deck, and essential.<br>
<br>
You should be able to get to My&#146;iioom with the following cards: <br>
Alter x3<br>
The second portion of the sense combo card<br>
A good amount of activation<br>
Janus&#146;s ability<br>
<br>
I must admit, this area may be lacking, because just now, I posted this up, and this area was VERY LOOOOONG, but, the computer glitched this area, and deleted about 3 thousand words worth of info, so now I am a little bit fustrated and forced to be a bit rush in my explanations, etc. SORRY.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to how you play the deck....<br>
<br>
Let the opponent make the first moves. Then, set-up your control lockdown against them. This deck is based upon being control oriented, and to eliminate what your opponent plays. Thus the reason why it is &quot;CONTROL&quot;, you must see what your opponent is playing, and COUNTER it. <br>
<br>
The deck is set-up to eliminate the opponent&#146;s gameplan rather then have a gameplan. If opponent has no gameplan, he has no movement. Without movement, he has no progress. Without progress, he can win. Without winning.... he loses. If the opponent loses.... you win. I imagine you can see where this is going...<br>
<br>
Lower in this deck/article I will explain/talk/ramble on about how you should compare the two decks from each other and find your gameplan.<br>
<br>
After the first deck, I listed a small strategy section, where it lists key cards. Most of those key cards works in the second deck as well. So to see which key cards are good, and which are straight tech that requires you to think, check that section out, even if you are just reading the second deck.<br>
<br>
The late game of this deck:<br>
<br>
In the late game, this deck tends to slowdown. With Onith getting rid of the last of the characters it possibly can get rid of, and you force draining them for a little bit. The end game will seem to drag on. If the opponent leaves some characters open, drop your beatdown squads and eliminate all opposition.<br>
<br>
I hope this explains this deck well enough.... I will now go into how to compare the two decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;B&gt; &lt;CENTER&gt; &lt;U&gt; HOW TO COMPARE THESE TWO DECKS: &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/CENTER&gt; &lt;/U&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, when I previously posted this, I checked this section to be 12 pages in Microsoft Word. SO yes.... this will be very long. But, now that I write this the second time, I realize it will probably not be nearly as long. As the first time through, I went into-depth about the player, player style, and other specifics that pertain mostly about YOU the player, rather then comparing the deck.<br>
<br>
But, moving right along, I will continue to push into that uncharted territory that only I can push!<br>
<br>
How to choose which deck of the above to play?<br>
<br>
Well, first it all depends on YOU, the player. You must first realize what type of player you are, what level your playing ability is on, and what style of play you prefer. I suggest that you read this whole deck/article up to this section, at least 4 times through, then do it again, then read through it again. Then read other Bring Him Before Me Decks, then, read other players decks. Then read Newbie decks, then read Advanced players decks. Then read Tournament Reports, and learn how these Advanced people play, then read Newbie Reports, and see what mistakes the little people make. Then, read articles, and learn what play styles there are, and how they interact. <br>
<br>
I must confess, when I first wrote this up, I discussed the above in a very well thought out detail, instead of sending you off to find your own in this vast DeckTech world. But, now that I sit-down with a more limited time to type and write this great project of mine out, I realize, its probably better if you read all of the above, rather then just what I give you.<br>
<br>
Now that you have read this at least 9 times through, go back, and read it once more, to make it an even 10 times. <br>
<br>
You should now understand the basies for what I am prepared to speak upon.<br>
<br>
What level play are you?<br>
<br>
Newbie-<br>
Middle-<br>
Advanced-<br>
<br>
These are the three types of players that are mostly oftly seen in tournaments, friendly games, and the such.<br>
<br>
You must recognize where you stand on this situation to better prepare yourself for the above. <br>

As I do beleive what I am prepared to say will probably zoom on by over the new players heads, but, it will still be a good read for them. Print this out, and put this by your bedside, and read it every night before you go to sleep. Then.... young apprentice.... you shall get better.... err.... sorry, wrong &quot;mode&quot; there.<br>
<br>
But, ol&#146; great master, how do I find out what level I am on?<br>
<br>
Well, this is rather simple, though it probably seems it should be complex.<br>
<br>
Ask the following questions of yourself:<br>
<br>
How many tournaments have I been in?<br>
<br>
How have I done in those tournaments?<br>
<br>
Whats my rating?<br>
<br>
Whats my win-loss average?<br>
<br>
Do I play with Traffic Control / Reactor Terminal?<br>
<br>
Do I understand the probabilities of destinies?<br>
<br>
Do I know how to track?<br>
<br>
Have I learned from every game I have either won or lost?<br>
<br>
Now, what do your answers mean?<br>
<br>
Well, if you know how to track, you have basically been lifted up straight from Newbie to Middle, unless thats all you know how to do.<br>
<br>
Tracking is probably one of the hardest things to do in the game, as we speak, and it will not change {due to the lack of cards that will be coming out}.<br>
<br>
Traffic Control / Reactor Terminal<br>
<br>
What does this have to do with what level player I am?<br>
<br>
Well, its rather simple. Their tools. Their level checkers. When I was but a learner, I always packed these in my decks. Every deck I ever made, included the above two cards {in the appropriate sides of course}. <br>
<br>
I would always draw waay to many cards up during my draw phase. And end up with too big of a hand. So, I&#146;d play Traffic Control, use it the next turn, and drop all those cards back down in my used pile.<br>
<br>
If you play without these cards enough, you will learn how much to draw, and when to stop, what cards are worth saving in your hand, what cards are worth losing to a drain, what card do I put down with Janus, etc.<br>
<br>
Like I said, their tools, and level checkers.<br>
<br>
Now that we have noticed what level we are, lets chose what type of player we are. This mostly, depends on our GENES.<br>
<br>
What?! We&#146;re going back in time.... to when your parents MADE you {sorry I had to get so graphic....}.<br>
<br>
Thats right, I&#146;m talking about Heredity and Genetics.<br>
<br>
What does Genetics have to do with SWCCG?<br>
<br>
Amazingly.... alot.<br>
<br>
Due to what genes you have pulled from the great and vast gene pool from your parents, of course, made you when you were born. If you pulled the black hair gene, you get black hair, WALA! But, these genes will determine your likes, your dislikes, your intelligence, your ability to succeed in your life, your want to perform, your diseases, your immunity to diseases, etc. IF your parents were abundantly smart, you will most likely become smart. IF your parents were stupid like the cavemen, you might very well be stupid. These genes made you to be who you are now, and in the future, and in the past.<br>
<br>
But what do they have to do with SWCCG?<br>
<br>
Your personality makes up the second level of how to chose between the two decks {there are 4 levels}. We&#146;re on level 2 right now, we&#146;ve passed through level 1 earlier {your stage of &quot;player-hood&quot;.}. So, your personality decides what type of player you are?<br>
<br>
If you have ADD and do not have a very good attention span, you will probably not even be able to read this far, but besides that, you will not want to play a game for very long. Meaning you will want to end the game as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
If you have a great amount of patientce, you may be willing to draw out games, making them last for long periods of time, thus eliminating the ability of one mistake being fatal.<br>
<br>
So we&#146;ve now realized, that genes shape us, and shape our SWCCG playing. How does this affect my choice of the two above decks?<br>
<br>
Well, your different personality, starts to shape up your different player style.... which by luck have it, leads us onto level 3 of our &quot;building&quot;.<br>
<br>
Level 3.... figuring out our Playing Style.<br>
<br>
Your playing style ultimatly shapes your decision the most. Level 1 and 2 do shape you as a player, but this is where it all comes together. This is where you notice what you are, and how you are, what makes you tick, how you will play, what will happen while you play. This is where all those strands come together to form a STRONG rope.<br>
<br>
But figuring out your playing style is the tricky part. First, we must do research. The first step in the research process, is to check out all of the articles in the article section of this site. Read about playing styles, read about control decks, read about aggro decks, learn. LEARN young Padawan. Knowledge is Defense. <br>
<br>
Your playing style has a few variances to it.<br>
<br>
Ask these questions to yourself to figure out your playing style:<br>
<br>
Do I like to lockdown my opponent?<br>
<br>
Do I like to react to what my opponent plays?<br>
<br>
Do I learn from my mistakes?<br>
<br>
What have I been taught by all of the bests in my area?<br>
<br>
Do I like to play with alot of characters?<br>
<br>
OR do I like to play with alot of interrupts/effects?<br>
<br>
Do I go for the more popular decks, or do I make original decks?<br>
<br>
Do I like to set-up things?...<br>
 .... or do I like to react to what my opponent sets up?<br>
<br>
Once you have asked yourself these questions, write your responses down on paper so we can better analyze you the player.<br>
<br>
If you answered YES to most of those, you probably are an originist.<br>
<br>
If you answered NO to most of those, you are a follower, someone who lets the rest lead, and one to take over.<br>
<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<br>
Well, to play these decks, you need to combine a little bit of both of these two groups.<br>
<br>
The decks have these slight things with them.<br>
<br>
The second deck, you notice is more aimed at being control oriented.<br>
<br>
And the first deck is more aimed at being Aggro {aggressive, beatdown, etc.}, or.... is it?<br>
<br>
Thats where you must make the descision.<br>
<br>
As you notice, there isn&#146;t many changes between Version 1) of my deck, and Version 2). <br>
<br>
The changes, although there physically, is mostly mentally.<br>
<br>
...but.... how can that be?<br>
<br>
Simple. It all has to do with my strategy sections, and the cards implied.<br>
<br>
You notice, that I state in my strategy section, that the second deck seems aimed at being Control oriented. Though, the starting platform for it is an Aggro platform. Why does it seem control oriented then?<br>
<br>
It seems control oriented because of the opinion I have expressed onto it.<br>
<br>
You will notice this more defined&#146; in the first deck. The first deck is what I would define as a NEUTURAL deck. It can swing both ways {and no, I do not mean that sexually!}. It can swing into the CONTROL river, and then it swims in the AGGRO river. It all depends on the player, and his player style.<br>
<br>
If you looked at the first deck, and said, &quot;WOW, this deck is so designed to set-up beatdowns and administer them onto the opponent!&quot; <br>
<br>
Your playing style is probably a more aggressive style of play then, you probably want to destroy the opponent at all costs. Who cares about little side-strategies, I want to kill, kill, kill!<br>
<br>
If you looked at the deck, and said, &quot;WOW! This deck is so set-up for controlling my opponent,  and setting up a lockdown!&quot;. <br>
<br>
Then, your playing style is probably a CONTROL playing style. You let your opponent do his &quot;jank&quot; and then you react, and pounce on him like a cat.<br>
<br>
OR, you could be like JEEBS. Who reviewed my first BHBM deck {BHBM: Manipulation}. He said {and I&#146;m paraphrasing here}:<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow! I love this deck! It can go either way, it can either give beats or it can control! I love it!&quot;<br>
<br>
As we can tell from this paraphrased statement, JEEBS is probably a neutural player.<br>
<br>
One who has his leg on both sides of the fence. When he gets into the pool, sometimes he likes to run and jump in, and then, sometimes, he checks, to see if its a good temperature.<br>
<br>
One week, he will have a beatdown deck.<br>
<br>
The next week, he will have a control deck.<br>
<br>
And, maybe the week after that, he&#146;ll have a neutural deck, similar to mine.<br>
<br>
We have learned from this one comment, what makes JEEBS tick, what makes him think, and how he plays. We learned, that he plays a more Neutural Playing Style.<br>
<br>
So, take JEEBS for example, and evaluate yourselves. And check what kind of playing style you play with.<br>
<br>
This basically concludes the &quot;comparison&quot; segment of my deck/article. Hopefully, through this, you have learned ALOT about Bring Him Before Me, and you have also learned alot about yourself, as a player, and as a person.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, as you will notice, I did not give you much strategy to the first deck, to prove my point of its &quot;neuturality&quot; in this segment here. If you players would like more strategy for it, ask for it in the Review section, and I will edit my strategy section, and give it to you.<br>
<br>
I did post all of this strategy in the deck list section, so that I can read your comments, questions, and suggestions in the Read Reviews segment, and put them all in one big Update segment in my Strategy Section.<br>
<br>
<br>
A breif history of me and Bring Him Before Me:<br>
<br>
Once DS2 came out, I immediatly made a BHBM deck. I didn&#146;t own any Emperors, yet, I made the deck. I played, and played with it. It was my favorite deck. I learned the ins and outs with it. And then, finally, Ref2 came out, and I heard a new Emperor was going to be in it.<br>
<br>
But, when the set came out, I realized he sucked, but that didn&#146;t matter, it was an Emperor I owned! I could finally make my BHBM deck work, and boy, would I!<br>
<br>
I continued to play that deck, not very successfully though, but I played it cuz I loved it. It went through about 100 difference changes.<br>
<br>
Finally, Chad Bowser, the shop runner of Omnidon&#146;s at the time, pulled an Emperor FOIL from DS2. !!!<br>
<br>
Then, the shop moved and became known as Twilight Games. Once there, I traded him 3 Turn the Tides {REALLY good Raw Deal cards} for the FOIL Emperor!<br>
<br>
Finally, my Bring Him Before Me deck would be successful!<br>
<br>
And I continued to play it until Coruscant came out. Where, when I realized, everyone in the whole WORLD knew my deck inside and out. But, then I switched to my Senator deck of doom. And now, that everyone knows that deck inside and out, I go back to OLD FAITHFUL!<br>
<br>
Thanxs goes out to:<br>
Chad Bowser for getting me my FOIL DS2 Emperor!<br>
James Leiser for being cool.<br>
Rory Dibeler for letting me use him as an example even though he doesn&#146;t know it yet!<br>
Drew Scott, for being cool.<br>
<br>
Slops goes out to: Gay Steve, for never changing his Hidden Base deck. BE ORIGINAL MAN!<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you want, D-mail me any suggestions, comments, questions, hate letters, or love notes you might want to RYPCORD.<br>
<br>
In the strategy section, I will review all questions, etc. I have gotten either that was D-mailed to me, E-mailed to me, IMed to me, or put in the Review section, and I will express those opinions, etc. in the strategy section.<br>

EDIT:<br>
Apparently, there was TAGS in the beginning segment, due to my having to copy and paste it, due to all of the errors I had with it. Sorry.<br>
Also, sorry about the failed attempt to add in HTML stuff with it. If you know how to do that properly, please D-mail me, or say so when you review this. Thanxs!<br>
<br>
<br>
Catch phrases:<br>
WHAT?! I said.... WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT????!!!<br>
PROVE ME WRONG!<br>
Remember, we choose if SWCCG lives or dies. Its in our hands. Its like a wet dog, who just washed up shore, sure.... we have a gun in our hand, and sure... we could shoot it and put it out of its misery, but, why not play with it a bit first?<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ll come up with some more catch phrases next time I edit this.<br>
