<br>
Sex Machine- Ok, 3 Vaders + 2 Holonet Transmission + The Empires Back = Gets Vader out early. I have not played a single game where I got Vader out later than turn 3 (Ive played quite a few games with the deck...never even had to use Holonet). As for Ephant Mon getting beaten down, its never happened. Also, if they deploy Jar Jar and a beatdown squad and Clash the Emperor, just pull Force Lightning and kill Ephant Mon! That would cancel the battle quite nicely. I think I&#146;d also notice the significant amount of force they save to deploy Jar Jar, Qui-Gon and 2-3 EPPs, and I would be able to take precautions against it.<br>
<br>
HBX? Wait for flip, send ships to probe. Not that difficult. Super Falcon? I thought Han was killing Ephant Mon. Oh well...if EPP Leia is the other pilot, then Zuckuss is forfeit fodder. Bossk + Boba = 2 destiny draws. More than enough to break the Falcons and make em forfeit both. And if you really want to be mean, just use the 2nd part of the Control/Set For Stun card. If Capn. Han and EPP Leia are both piloting, use the Set For Stun to bounce Han back to their hand and battle the now defenseless Falcon. You could use either Boba for his immunity or Zuckuss since their destiny = 0 now. And in case you didnt notice, Visage hurts HBX. A lot. I also said that since it wasnt played much around, I took out Search and Destroy, which will hurt them 2x as much. (Note: I said that if it was big in your area, put it in and Security Precautions, if you really needed to)<br>
<br>
Racing? ANY dark side deck doesnt have a chance against a dedicated LS racer. A Step Backwards gives you NO destinies. If theyre not playing ASB, then I have a rather good chance, as I can either A) Stack and track with Drop or B) Rely on my approx. 20 four and above destinies. Either way, I like my chances.<br>
<br>
And RST...LOL! Vader and Maul could easily hold the Bunker. Their scouts just dont match up to them. The only two characters commonly seen in a RST deck that can break Mauls ability are Luke and Obi. If either of them come down, duel them. Its that simple.<br>
---<br>
Ok, I think most people know how to play a Hunt Down deck so Im just gonna get right to it. This deck doesnt thrive on a first turn flip. You have enough non-essential cards here that you can lose to Visage for a few turns while you get things set up.<br>
<br>
Tip: Try to avoid deploying Vader without his lightsaber. With 2 in the deck, along with 2 Weapon Levs you shouldnt have much trouble getting one.<br>
<br>
Early game- Pull Ephant Mon and get him to the Holotheatre. Back him up with the Emperor if you feel your opponent might be playing Jar Jar. Get out your docking bays, and the Landing Site if you drew it.<br>
<br>
Mid game- Youve got Vader and Maul out and either draining or slicing their Jedi. Once they come out, you should be able to control at least one site to keep your objective flipped. If they deploy Luke (or some other misc Jedi), you can either move Vader or to save time take him into your hand (however he will lose his lightsaber). If youve &#8217;dropped&#8217; your destinies, then duel em. If not, battle and slice.<br>
<br>
Late game- By now, theyve lost a lot to Visage and possibly to your drains. Since youve got them at a disadvantage with retrieval (which Ill explain later) they shouldnt be making any comebacks. Drain/visage them out.<br>
<br>
Card Explanations-<br>
<br>
Allegations Of Corruption: This card rocks. I considered starting Mob. Points for the extra activation instead, but with DDTA floating around making it virtually useless, I figured this is much better. Against a Harvesting or On The Edge WYS (which is big around here) this card is a lifesaver. Once I lost a game (by 6 force) to a WYS that retrieved about 20 with tracked 7s since I grabbed their Control/Tunnel Vision. (Quick question...If I grab Control/Tunnel Vision or any combo interrupt for that matter, if they played the original version of the card (i.e. a normal Control) would they have to stack it, or not?) Why do I start it? So I can grab any interrupt played from the beginning on. <br>
<br>
Power of the Hutt: Visage protection. Gets Ephant Mon out first turn to protect you from spies. Back him up with Palpatine if you feel you must.<br>
<br>
Docking Bay choices: Endor for against RST or TIGIH, Cloud City vs. QMC, and Spaceport Docking bay for all those hard-to-reach places. WYS is big around here, so I dont play DB94.<br>
<br>
Vader Selection: Premiere Vader is the bomb for use with I Have You Now. If youre not confident in your destiny draws against Luke, just put down Vader, I Have You Now and attrition him to death. DLOTS to choke all the smuggler scrubs and any big scrubs if youve got tracked 6s. Heck, I choked Kenobi once with a tracked Phantom Menace (They regretted killing my Maul...hehe). Lord Vader for pure staying power and for saber slicing. (Also, these are the only Vaders I have, so theres a Empires Back, which lets me choose any one of em after I look for a docking bay, in the 4th ones place).<br>
<br>
Bounty Hunter ships: Self Explanatory. No Infiltrator to put in, though. =(<br>
<br>
Why not start Phantom Menace? Maul wont be out right away, and 7 destiny is always good to have around.<br>
<br>
Oppresive Enforcement: No combo card because this is higher destiny. I dont start it because 2/3 of my starter effects are necessary and the other one is just too good. This over TINT since it recirculates my high-destiny interrupts back into my deck if theyre cancelled. Not bad.<br>
<br>
Do They Have A Code Clearance?: Anti-retrieval, pure and simple. This is a meta choice, due to the WYS/Retrieval decks that are played in the area, so feel free to sub out for Search and Destroy or what have you to combat space, etc.<br>
<br>
Only one Visage: Dont have any more. =( Although, I think the only game where it got cancelled I retrieved it in my opponents podrace. Hehe...<br>
<br>
Only one Circle?: Again, a meta choice. WYS is really my only major competition around here, and Ben isnt played much (although its not unheard of) so theres only one.<br>
<br>
Matchups-<br>
<br>
WYS: If you play right, just about any WYS deck will fall before this. Code Clearance their retrieval, Zuckuss, Boba and Bossk their Kessel ships. Control the Cantina with Vader. If you fear beatdown, keep Maul or Emperor with him. Ephant Mon is useless against this and so is OE, so start Code Clearance instead of Power. Use Mara as your suicide bomber against Luke if he comes down and you dont want to move Vader from where he is. Make SURE you have 2 of your 4 visage-protecting interrupts in your hand at ALL TIMES. If the Palace Raiders variant is big in your area, take out Allegations for Wipe Them Out, All Of Them. No more than 2 destiny for them...<br>
<br>
Hidden Base: Not played too much around here. Save your BH ships for until they flip, then spread and probe. Visage will hurt them rather badly in this game, so make sure to keep it well protected. Undercover spies may be a problem, so keep that Sniper handy.<br>
<br>
Profit: Die! Unless theyre playing a whole crap load of racing interrupts, you should be able to win the race (if theyre racing, that is). It really shouldnt matter if the free Han or not...he wont be on the table long anyways. Or if you feel like it, try and hold the Chamber, although its more than likely a waste of cards and energy. Its much easier to just kill Han and be done with it. This shouldnt be a hard match.<br>
<br>
TIGIH: Scouts can be nasty. Be careful not to let cards stack too high on I Feel... Make sure Ephant Mon is at Holotheatre, since they can pull Blount with Crix. Grab Luke with Vader at your convienience. If you so desire, track your destiny and Force Lightning him to death. I used to have Young Fool in here just in case Luke or someone tried a suicide attack on the Emperor and failed...oh well.<br>
<br>
RST: Dont let them blow the bunker. Hold it with Maul and the Emperor. Again, Crix can pull Blount, so Ephant Mon your Visage. Beware a scout-swarm beatdown. Just stay flipped and let the Visage and draining do its work.<br>
<br>
EBO: Ouch. This is gonna be tough. Hopefully you get your BH ships quickly, cause if not, theyre going to be draining your for quite a lot rather quickly. Flip fast, drain hard, battle right and hopefully youll win.<br>
<br>
Senate: Let the fools have their Council Chamber. Who cares if the Jedi just sit there? They cant touch your Vader, and they dont flip your objective. Leave them be. Hold a Docking Bay or two, and drain, visage, repeat. Battle anyone foolish enough to take you on. If you need to, put the spaceport docking bay on Coruscant, send the Emperor in with Maul and Force Lightning a senator whos giving you trouble. Itd be pretty funny to see Emperor Palpatine force lightning Senator Palpatine... Choke Vader also works in the senate.<br>
<br>
MBO: Invade Yavin with your people. Let Vader work the docking bay while Mara and Maul kill elsewhere. I cant recommend letting them blow up the Death Star.<br>
<br>
RTP: Not much experience here, but killing Leia is probably a good idea (after they flip though, so they cant just deploy another one to the DB and then move over and flip). Protect Visage, as always. Thats about it.<br>
<br>
Well, that took long enough. Anyways, any contructive criticism is welcome. Thanks and enjoy!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
