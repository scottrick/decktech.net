<br>
Here&#8217;s how it works.  My control phase, drain 3 (the palace), drain 3 (the audience chamber), drain 3 (the lower passages)... deploy an ORS, battle, I retrieve 3, you lose 1, I Ghhhk, I retrieve my ORS, your turn.  Go.  After you activate 1, I Abyssin for the ORS I just retrieved, cancel your drain w/ Den of Thieves, and use him to battle with next turn.<br>
<br>
Well, that&#8217;s how it works if they have too much ground power for me to wipe out completely.  Otherwise I just drain for more and kill you with Search and Destroy.  <br>
<br>
Granted, I have to draw up for the Palace, but I have three and usually get it in the first turn or two.  Jabba, Scum, and Chall make my deploy -3 at the chamber, so I don&#8217;t need much activation.<br>
<br>
vs. Hidden Base - my drains can&#8217;t be cancelled and I can pull JSC with Power of the Hutt.  It costs me 4 force to drop it with 2 forfeit-5 ORS, power 11.  Bring out my other ships, drop, battle, retrieve, retrieve the ships next turn, cancel the Kessel drain (which is the big one) with Den.<br>
<br>
vs. MWYHL - slows me down and sometimes doesn&#8217;t give me anyplace to battle, but three ground drains of one and S&D will do the job.  If I can hold tatooine, that&#8217;s another drain and an Occupation.<br>
<br>
vs. Watch Your Step and Profit - ha. hahaha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Step smugglers can get into the palace and do... what, exactly?  My ORS are forfeit 6.  You can&#8217;t drain me at the Passages if you manage to hold it (in fact, please do... it&#8217;s another place to send a kamikaze ORS), my Chamber is too pumped for you to do anything... Profit will NEVER free Han and I have Point Man for the Bo Shuda / OtE combo, and if you spread out to maximize the occupation damage I&#8217;ll be retrieving three from each site.<br>
<br>
vs. Mains on Another Planet - -1 to all your drains and battlegrounds for me to retrieve.  Woo hoo!<br>
<br>
This deck has lost twice since I started playing it a few month ago... once because I accidentally forfeited the last agent on Tatooine instead of somethign else without realizing it (his drains got a lot bigger) and once because I forgot that Arica at a JP site nullifies No Bargain and None Shall Pass... ouch, please, no more mains...oh god, not another one...<br>
<br>
Hmmm, someone slammed me with a rather illiterate review but I think I got the gist of it.  For anyone who was interested, I&#146;ll explain the odd card choices I make.  Gailid is in the deck.  Tatooine is in there to satisfy an opponent&#146;s Battle Plan when a fortified Kessel is the only eligible system on the table, so I can build up.  And it&#146;s beaten several WYS decks, both ground- and space- themed.  I only play one exterior site (that&#146;s all i need to make the deck work) so the barge and the walkers are pointless.  And the Hidden Weapons thing is fun, I used to play them but I took them out because I didn&#146;t NEED them.  Thanks for the feedback, everybody!<br>
