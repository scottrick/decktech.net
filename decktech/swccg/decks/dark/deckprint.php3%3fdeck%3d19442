<br>
***ok here you go. first most defensive sheild won&#146;t hurt you.  vs the new dueling deck try for a first turn vader or maul at the 2/3 site.  if you can get the fast flip this is good. <br>
you have good character removal which still woreks vs the new super mains. <br>
han/chewie in falcon is a nice ship but so is zuckuss in MH or an admiral with imp command.  <br>
you don&#146;t give away much force to any decks so that will slow them.<br>
vs the new ewok deck you lose.  there is no way choke vader with a stick and dr e, nor tatooine maul can deal with the power of the ewok.<br>
i&#146;m not sure what other ls decks will be big for r3 but it doesnt matter cause you will win<br>
<br>
i&#8217;ve never been a fan of hunt-down but i made this when coruscant came out and its not bad.  it can take a lot of damage from cheese hit and run decks like dagobah or various podrace/insert decks and still come back to win.  it gets better with r3 but it doesnt need it to win.<br>
<br>
this is a beatdown version as opposed to dueling or racing or something.<br>
<br>
get out vader fast and other guys and do dammage.<br>
<br>
there is some things you can add like epic duel or a racer but you dont really need them to win with.<br>
<br>
vs<br>
pudprofit- start either arica ( if you want to force them to make the first move) or xixor/dr e (if you want to be aggressive).  chybc and plans hurts retrevial.  fight, damage, win.<br>
<br>
scouts- kill the scouts, win.  <br>
<br>
new dueler obj- play smart.  you can track/stack good destinies, so do it.  fast damage is key.<br>
<br>
hb/flip- well you have a solid space package that can usually spread to 2 or 3 systems to probe.  you need miltiple destinies + hi destinies in space.  s and d, visage will eat them (along with drains if you successfully probe). beware suicide epp&#8217;s.<br>
<br>
wys- a tough game.  you have good character removal.  beware beatdown. situp big at the system and catina.  fight and win.<br>
<br>
jizz- win  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
