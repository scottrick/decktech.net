Strategy :	<br>
	<br>
Start with Wakeelmui, Combat Response, Mob. Points, IAO.<br>
Before you activate force pull kuat from reserve deck.<br>
activate force, deploy kuat (now you get a +2 force generation<br>
from Wakeelmui). Search for a docking bay. If in your starting<br>
hand was Commander Brandei or Gherant, deploy them to the DB.<br>
try to draw as fast as possible one of these guys for<br>
a better force activation and the ability to pull Ex-sites in<br>
your hand. Deploy them and draw. If you draw an asteroid field<br>
or a big one deploy them to wakeelmui. Once both, Sienar Fleet Systems<br>
and Flagship Ops on table you can deploy an emperor&#146;s ship on the big one.<br>
(don&#146;t forget because of Flagship Ops every TIE is deploy -1 so the<br>
Palpi&#146;s Ships are deploy -3) retrieve 3 force. next turn let it die, and deploy <br>
another Palpi-Ship. retrieve 3 force. next turn you can activate as much as <br>
you want, except one card. If opponent&#146;s first action in your control phase <br>
was to kill the ship, then the last card must be the destroyed ship. <br>
If you draw a system deploy it with a (matching pilot) TIE and a<br>
star destroyer. With Admiral Chiraneau your drains on Sullust, Endor and <br>
Kashyyyk are each + 1. With the Scythe and Tallon Roll you can beat some<br>
nasty rebel ships, like the falcon. if you want, you can track the<br>
8-destiny ships (The emperor ones: each TIE destiny +2) to have a <br>
high Tallon Roll total. <br>
Use the Undercover Spys to block opponent&#146;s force drains.<br>
Keep a Never Yalnal in hand to protect them from Corran Horn.<br>
If you draw the asteroid fields deploy them to Wakeelmui to raise your<br>
drains on Big One. It&#146;s important to deploy the asteroids to <br>
wakeelmui, so its hard for opponent to come to the wakeelmui system.<br>
I think Sienar Fleet System is a very powerful card, and I searched<br>
for a way to deploy the Emps Ships more cheap. With Flagship Ops,<br>
it&#146;s pretty cool to deploy a 2-cost ship and then retrieve 3 force and<br>
later let it die. Another way to retrive force is to battle the<br>
opponent with an empi-ship where you have a little bit less power. <br>
At the end of the battle let it go to the used pile to track a high destiny!<br>
You should not have damage because your TIE has a high forfeit value.<br>
(+6:flagship Ops.)<br>
