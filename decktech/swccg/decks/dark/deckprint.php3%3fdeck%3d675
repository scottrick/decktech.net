First I'll talk about the deck then get specific. Start - Surface Defense is a nice solid all around start. Against Hidden Base you start Security Precautions. If they have NO Rebels then you don't have to panic. This deck has 3 count'em three ways to retrieve globs of force : Drazin Delivery , Rystall , and Scum and Villany/First Strike. All of these are very potent especially when you get 2 working together. The main play of the deck is to get Ak-Rev out ASAP and get the necessary musicians you need : Greeata for quick deploy and good forfeit , Rappertunnie to keep them from battling you , Umpass-Stay for power , Lirin Car'n to cut off the Security Tower from deployment. Between Greeta , Jabba , and Scum and Villiany your characters will be flying out of your hand at a huge rate of speed ( Fett is free with Lyn Me ). With Umpass-Stay and 3-4 musicians that'll usually mean its time to shake hands. Now to specific.<br>
<br>
v. HB - Start Security Precautions. Get retrieval engine running and start probing after they flip.<br>
Ability x3 is really strong as are grapplers. Shouldn't be to hard to win this game.<br>
<br>
v. Ops - start normally 3 effects. Resistance will keep the losses minimal. Try to retrieve the Controls and Counter Assaults for the engine over and over and over again. The Skiffs will help move your two hit-squads all over the place and Bubo will have lots of nice snacks.<br>
<br>
v. Test 2 - It's all about Ability x3. It'll probably be a pretty long game but you'll retrieve whatever damage they can do. Might be able to suck them into a trap ( lone Fett w/ Lyn Me etc...).<br>
<br>
Other miscellaneous notes : Hidden Weapons is a nice way to keep the Drazin engine going and is a really sweet card. This deck has a chance against anything but isn't exactly easy to play. It takes a bit of practice to get into the Musician mindset.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
