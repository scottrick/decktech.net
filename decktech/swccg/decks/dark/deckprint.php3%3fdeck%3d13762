That thing`s operational </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is my version of DSII deck. I prefer to use the objective because its more<br>
solid than to use only endor-system instead.<br>
Basic idea is to build your Death Star ASAP. Then drain and cause direct damage. Direct<br>
damage from DSII is more secure than cancellable drain bonuses from Ominous rumours. Also<br>
it gives you much help in space war. Thats why this deck type can be exellent.<br>
There is some major difrences between this deck and normal DSII decks. Youll notice that<br>
i start with Mobilization points instead of Desperade counter(witch is not even in my deck).<br>
<br>
First turn play Moff J to bunker and play Rendili, pull sector to DSII and so on...<br>
You will get a lot of activation because of Mob.points and DSII and its sectors.<br>
Put some badass in bunker to support Moff J incase they have a spy in hand.<br>
<br>
Because of your tremendous fleet and many big pilots(everything supported by operational Death Star) supreme space victory should be unavoidable. <br>
If Falcon is your nightmare, play GURI to space(Executor will really do the job).<br>
If X-wings are coming, keep your boats in tight groups. Battle deployment with Thrawn is <br>
iron here(-2 to power of each X-wing). If guns are suspected keep guys in capitals. Also<br>
Dark maneuvers can save your ships.<br>
<br>
This deck is also powerfull in the ground with its mains and walkers. <br>
You have two auto-undercover spies also. <br>
=So this deck should be very SOLID. <br>
<br>
IMPORTANT PART!!!<br>
OK. Now you think how the heck can i defend my DS from being blown away! There are no guns,<br>
no Desperade counter, not many TIEs. But as you see there is 3xSet for stun! Stun their<br>
General Calrissian, Han Solo or ANY pilot(s) they send. Their ships will just be floating junk<br>
in the DSII sectors(where no one can deploy)! Ok Luke will be trouble, but who plays him to<br>
space or sends him to blow DSII up??? You have two trackable sixes, so you can have a shot at him. = So DSII is NOT gonna blow!! <br>
&quot;Were quite safe from your friends here.&quot; <br>
-The Emperor<br>
<br>
Some card explanations:<br>
Vader with saber: Best vader for this kind deck(according to my opinion). Lord Vader needs<br>
separate saber to efficient and any decent ground deck will laugh at his attrition immunity.<br>
Choke Vader is good, but i thing auto-saber is even better.<br>
<br>
Elis helrot: with no imperial arrest order this card can be a game winner. If opponent has<br>
insurrection, you can still move with it.<br>
<br>
Other cards are self-explaining(Ask me if not).<br>
<br>
Alright then here comes the matchups:<br>
<br>
MWYHL: Drain heavily and battle. JT1 will do them no good! When they are about to do JT5,<br>
screw thier tracking with uncertain is the future!<br>
<br>
EBO: Conquer space, rule the ground and drain. Walkers can storm Hoth if necessary. Imperial degree will help.<br>
<br>
WYS: Take space. Grap their key interrupt. Conguer ground, Thrawn and Battle deployment will<br>
do wonders in your conquest for Tatooine. Park your Moon over their planet. <br>
<br>
RTP: Rule space, fight in ground. Imperial degree will kill them.<br>
<br>
QMC: Take Bespin=win, so A LOT OF FORCE THERE! Remember to give Bespin one extra Moon.<br>
<br>
Mains: Battle and drain. Youll have the power to compete with them. And your drains and direct<br>
damage will hurt them too much.<br>
<br>
Agents in court: Start Battle order. Aliens and droids can strike them. Imperials will probably have to move to JP.<br>
Walkers can attack to sandstormed sites.<br>
<br>
HP: Havent played ever so ??? Your fleet is enough to create a threat or crush them.<br>
<br>
Profit: Put Boba Fett and Xizor to AC. Send more guys ASAP. Drain them from space.<br>
