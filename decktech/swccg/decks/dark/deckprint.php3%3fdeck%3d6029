Easily. Yavin 4 mains generally needs to drain off of the opponent's sites. With this deck, you play your 2/0 sites, play CHYBC (there's 3 Twi'leks, you'll find it), and set up heavily on 1 site and 1 system. You're steadily draining for 4 a turn, and your opponent can't do anything. Do you really think that he wants to mess with Vader + Tarkin + Dune Walker with Igar piloting? If he does, he'll have to commit everyone there, and then you let him have that site and set up somewhere else, while all his mains are stranded elsewhere. Simple, no? The standard start is the 3rd Marker and Combat Readiness for the Wampa Cave. This gives you 5 force first turn, and the best drain 2 site in the game. Why the Wampa Cave instead of the Ice Plains? You can't be Mechanical Failured (very useful), and, since EBO might be coming back with the 3rd Anthology, a -1 drain at the Wampa Cave. The rest of the sites are good draining sites, or twix sites. Effects are mostly to counter what your opponent does. Characters are the best that the DS has, same for vehicles and ships. Here's a look at the match-ups:<br>
<br>
Ops: This is the only time you change your starting interrupt. Start Battle Order to slow them down, then establish your drains. Decree will really hurt them, and you have the power to battle them on their own planet. Dengar will be key if you're facing speeder ops.<br>
MWYHL: Both Endor and Kashyyyk are close to it, so load up the boarding party and head on over! Their mains can't hang with yours, and retrieval is generally shut down by CHYBC.<br>
Hit and Run: A good match-up, but a playable one. Your ships and vehicles keep you safe from weapons fire, and generally you can load up your sites enough that you don't have to worry about them attacking you.<br>
Hidden Base: Relatively easy game. Your ships will easily last in space, you've got the fodder to handle attrition, and you can hold the ground against a Falke-style deck. Lateral Damage will come in handy, and IJASKAW will handle the key components of the Super Falcon, or the occasional Landing Claw.<br>
Profit: Start Mara and Dr. E. Get her saber and move to Jabba's Palace for the early drain of 3. You can interfere with him (hopefully capture Han with Iggy) and set up your own drains enough to outlast him.<br>
<br>
Well, that's about it. If you have any questions, drop me a message BEFORE you review it. Thanks, and enjoy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
