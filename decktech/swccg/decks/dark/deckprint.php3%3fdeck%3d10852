On the first turn you should drop either a Palpy or Merrejk at the docking bay 327.  You pull corulag with mobilization points and if you dropped merrejk, pull another battleground system. Also drop a system if you have one in your starting hand.  On second turn you have 3 force from Death Star, 1 from palpy if he&#146;s on table, 3 from docking bay because you should control it and it gets +2 if you control it from mobilization points, 2 from corulag, and another 2 from any other system you dropped.  That&#146;s a total of 12 force. If Merrejk is on table pull another system (do this almost every turn). You&#146;ll be able to drop a lot of ships with all the force you have and you won&#146;t have to pay to drain because you occupy the docking bay and a battleground system. You pretty much just battle and drain the rest of the way.<br>
<br>
Against EBO<br>
  You should be able to take this out because you&#146;ll have a lot of space to block your opponent&#146;s drains and you should be able to out battle your opponent.<br>
<br>
Against There is good in him<br>
  Pretty much just out drain your opponent in space and if he comes into space battle him off the table.<br>
<br>
Against Mind what you have learned<br>
  You shouldn&#146;t have a problem be cause you don&#146;t have a lot of drain bonuses and can out battle him in space.<br>
<br>
Agains Mains and toys<br>
  Let your opponent have the ground you&#146;ll have space and if he drops a super falcon just drop Dengar in P1 and some other ships to take it out.<br>
<br>
Against Xwing swarm<br>
  There&#146;s a reason why I use Interceptors.<br>
<br>
Against hidden base<br>
  Just take over space and probe the systems.<br>
<br>
Against Profit<br>
  Battle order should slow your opponent down and you&#146;ll be draining big in space which is way more than his direct damage. If he drops The celebration just go take over Tattoine and cancel it.<br>
<br>
That should be eough for you to see that this deck can combat most of the decks out there. I hope you will have fun if you play this deck.<br>
