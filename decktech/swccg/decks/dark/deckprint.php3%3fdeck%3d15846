Please know how cards work before offer advice. Fades menaces control space and a site. Its kind of hard when 20 some odd ships going after you. Dont give redicilous scenarios and cards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
edit 1: frozen assets dont concern this deck. I got hit with it twice at the state and had no harm. Like i said, beggar is the only true weapon to hurt this deck. Presence of the force is useless in this deck. 5.1 version of this deck had it and it didn&#8217;t work well. Twiks are nice but rather drain and leave them with no force to swarm. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is long. So have patiences.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This deck has been ask to post for about last 9 months but i have waited in till CA open to end. It had a 8 months undefeated record 42-0 and lost 3 times total. This is the ultimate version of it. So have fun. All its loses came from one deck watch your step because of beggar. Nothing but that. It lost were never more than 13 and that came in state. Beacuse of this deck i placed 7 in the state with a differential of 106. Average win 31. Ok here how the cards work.<br>
<br>
Imperial decree is a awesome card. It kills opponents force drain bonuses which is awesome. Two battleground systems and one site (not battleground) sets it up. Thats easy.<br>
<br>
Lateral damage kills opponents in one turn damage.<br>
<br>
All power to weapons, come on u should know by now.<br>
<br>
Sense/combo is awesome. Sense a organized attack or on the edge or signal in the begining hurts any deck. Uncertainly about the future is for getting ready a ghkk before battle ends. No one wants to take a battle damage 30 so they use ghkk but uncertainly about the future is great. <br>
<br>
Ghkk/combo cancels hyper escape and battle damage. Primary for hidden base and echo base<br>
<br>
Sinear fleet to reteive and sent one tie to use pile.<br>
<br>
Ominous rumors is force drain bonuses Elsewhere.<br>
<br>
dreaded imperial starfleet for force drain bonuses.<br>
<br>
short range fighters for one time retieval.<br>
<br>
dark water for cancel a force drain<br>
<br>
admiral order: Hey power plus 3 is cool. Also nice to have a destiny 6 in there.<br>
<br>
ok for the start<br>
<br>
Force turn actived your force. Pull ominuos rumors and rendili/waulekin and ephant mon. Deploy ephont mon to bunker, deploy OR to endor and a tie to endor. Your done. (Ephont mon protects bunker without any problem. No one can deploy there. Read bunker rules it perfect)<br>
Now you should be almost setting up decrecc<br>
Second turn active your force, drain in endor for two. Deploy some ties to rendili and or waulekin. Look for new secret base (you dont have one but they have no clue) see what in your force pile.<br>
Third turn drain for 2 at endor 3 at rendili total of 5 by turn 3. Its already been 7 lost to oppenent. Draw and leave some in the force pile. Deploy any system you have. rest is up to you. <br>
<br>
Now for decks:<br>
<br>
Echo base:<br>
Its dead before you start the game. all you have to do deploy rendile and control endor and rendili with bunker its force drain bonuses are dead. Drain the @#$% out of them. Battle them when they get weak. I love when they deploy systems for me. More drains. Dont deploy systems let them come to you.<br>
<br>
Hidden base flip. <br>
security precautions kills it. Good hunting. Start with something special planned for them rather then decree. <br>
<br>
Hidden mains/ opertives the rest of the ground fools.<br>
Drain in space and watched them cry. Use should be done turn 8. Use waulekee as a system to pull to retive. its over.<br>
<br>
There is good in him.<br>
Now this is all about battle one time and draining them. They usely have one to three ships. Lateral damage home one and hit him hard. This is a bluff game. They think you got vader and make them think so. Deploy ephont mon  to bunker. It can hold its own against Luke. Especially power of 12 its fine. Dont forget endor system adds one for each ship there to your power at endor sites. As soon as u see back door get the MON out to your ship. <br>
<br>
WYS:<br>
Just control space. Play regular as you do. deploy arica to cantina and get a ghkk. Just in case they have Corn fool. Its 50/50 win. Only reason is the stupid (must be errated) beggar. If no beggar watch them cry. Use something special planned for the start. <br>
<br>
No love for the empire:<br>
<br>
Its over in 8 turns with drains. they will drain you for 3 a turn most and its game. Dont even sweet it. Impreal decree kills froce drain bonuses not force drains so your fine.<br>
<br>
training:<br>
dont even get O rumors. Just drain them. Its a easy win.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well all of you want to see this deck for last 6 months. Here it is. Best dark deck i have ever built. It won against top 20 players in CA accept for few which i have never faced. <br>
<br>
Ok for some decisions on cards:<br>
Why no numbers protects. simple answer i dont need. Its 8-0 against it. Won the first game of state sgainst numbers by 41. <br>
Why no sac proctection. I dont know. I never need it. You can remove dark waters for the proctetion. Of almost forgot. With ephont mon you can alter and sense anything. Destiny draws are easy a 2, so its easy. I done it before. Watch them drop there jaw.<br>
why not vader. @#$%, for what. This deck will get killed in ground. No questions about it. <br>
<br>
Due to new cards in tatonien this deck will became usuless. Jar jar can deploy to bunker and ouccch. Blowing up the bunker kind of sucks. Come on, no one wants to lose 8 cards and deploy your hand used pile. nooooo    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
