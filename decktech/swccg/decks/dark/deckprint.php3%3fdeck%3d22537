I did a copy and paste from word, and I didn&#146;t see the changes in Twi&#8217;lek Advisor, and The Emperor&#146;s Sword and Shield. This is my first review, so I&#146;ll be more careful next time. Thx.<br>
<br>
This deck was the first deck I ever used in the tournaments, which was a few days after Reflections 3 came out. I have added and subtracted a few things since, but I haven&#8217;t made any big changes in it.<br>
<br>
I start out with Wakeelmui, so I can get Sienar Fleet Systems out as a starting. This deck revolves around this effect, so I deploy a TIE there on my first turn to protect it from Alter and to retrieve Twi&#8217;lek Advisor back into the deck.<br>
<br>
A lot will depend on getting drains on some systems, so it will be great to get some locations out fast. I lost a game in the tourney because I couldn&#8217;t get any locations out to force drain on, but since then I added more. I kept the Death Star and Kuat in because they give me great force to generate.<br>
<br>
Ability, Ability, Ability goes great with this deck since half my deck has ability in it, and I have Pride Of The Empire in case there are battles in space. Also Fear is a good way to strike the opponent since I can just retrieve those back by deploying more TIEs.<br>
<br>
This is strictly a space deck, so the only defenses I have on land are two undercover spies and Dreaded Imperial Starfleet. With these and the retrievals, I can usually slow down the force losses enough to get ahead of the opponent.<br>
<br>
For battling, this deck can pretty much dominate space. I try to hold off on deploying TIEs while waiting for the opponent to deploy in space first. Then I strike by deploying what TIEs are in my hand while using All Power To Weapons. Most of the time, this will knock them right out of space as well as making them lose forces depending on how much power they had. This is a low destiny deck, which is why I am more dependent on just overpowering the opponent with cards like APTW to get me through the battles. APTW also protects my TIEs from attrition, so I don&#8217;t usually lose a whole lot in battles.<br>
<br>
The only other times I deploy TIEs are to retrieve forces I need back. I use Star Destroyers to spread them out if I have too many TIEs at one location. I have a couple of senses to cancel out any Alters on my effects and I have Fighter Cover only to cancel any other Admiral&#8217;s Orders that the opponent may put down.<br>
<br>
All in all, this has been a very good deck for me. I have lost only a few times with it, and I have won a few flawless games. But it can have its challenges with today&#8217;s DShields, LSC, and Bravo Fighters.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
