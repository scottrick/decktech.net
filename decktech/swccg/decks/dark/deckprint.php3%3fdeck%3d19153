<br>
first of all- many props to john hawkins for the original creator  of speed deal.<br>
You usually set up second turn. quite a bit of force generation.<br>
set up the troopers and drain.<br>
<br>
on the ground it`s power +4 for dark deal+ power plus how many starships you`ve got at bespin cloud city and trooper assault +2.<br>
<br>
why not the imperial arrest order combo?<br>
because sometimes it does make a difference the forfeit plus 2 and with search and detsroy some troopers are forfeit 6.<br>
<br>
stunning leader is very good card because if they come down with all their mains it`s better to exclude them, cause they might have chewie or someone else left and that means one thing-BATTLE DAMAGE.<br>
<br>
occupation combined search and detsroy is excellent. some direct damge. you`ve got twi`leks for no escape and drop. control set for stun for less ability characters or the high force drain.<br>
tactical support to speed things up.<br>
<br>
most obvious card i`d just as soon kiss a wookie to delay things as much as possible. limited resources just for end game if it`s too close.<br>
snoova and his vibro ax-stunning leader doesn`t count and he can capture someone.<br>
<br>
agains stuff like wys or there is good in him or echo base, you start as quickly as possible. if you fear a beatdown get interrupts into hand and try to kick them off. against ebo drain as fast as possible before they drain you.control the vergeance if theyhave one.<br>
<br>
against hb flip start as soon as possible got 4 sites plus bespin and cloud city to drain at.<br>
direct damage-search and destroy and occupation will be too much.<br>
<br>
against pod profit secret plans slows them completely. obviously they don`t won`t you to drain so they come after you. use interrupts to delay and exclude. occupation is excellent and battle and drain. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
