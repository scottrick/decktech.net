<br>
MKOS Machine - UNH Style<br>
Strategy &amp; Techniques:<br>
  Starting Stuff: Power Of The Hutt &amp; No Bargain are a given. I usually start TINT/OE for Sac protection. First Strike and Secret Plans are the other possible starts.<br>
<br>
  Object of The Game: Get a &quot;Biggie Size&quot; Force Drain going and force your opponent to come to you &amp; To Retreive A LOT!<br>
<br>
  The Setup: Mighty Jabba, Ephant Mon, Boelo, and Mosep, Galid at the AC. Spread evrybody else out at Jabba&#146;s Palace sites ONLY! All of the other sites are unprotected from None Shall Pass (Exception against WYS). Galid Allows for force drain Bonuses at JP sites. Mosep helps that bonus by making it come directly form your reservce deck. Guri,Jade,Xizor, Snoova makes a good beatdown Squad. get Presence Of The Force Going At Jabba&#146;s Palace Anywheer so your drains are boosted. if everything is setup properly, you should have no problem defending your drains.<br>
<br>
  The Machine: Use Your abyssin Ornaments to Fetch Chevins. Use Power Of The Hutt To Fetch Bib Fortuna. Deploy both to an opponents site. Start a Battle Retreive 4 Force between Scum &amp; First Strike. Forfeit them both to satisfy for attrition and battle Damage. Next Turn Retrive Chevin with the Objective. Fetch another Bib from Deck using Power of the Hutt again. Start All Over again. If Your run out of Bibs and you&#146;re not retreiving them, then use Projective Telepathy to cancel the battle (You will still get to retrieve the 4 Force).<br>
  Some Notes about the machine: Tracking those abyssin ornaments &amp; Chevins helps so You dont have to draw up too many cards. A reactor terminal may be necesarry if this is too difficult. Barrier may also becoem a problem. if it is then you can include Blast The Door Controls. I don&#146;t see too much of this in my area so I am not including it. And If anything goes wrongin the battle always remember taht you have a Projective Telepathy.<br>
<br>
  Key Concepts: PROTECT THE PALACE and youmust remain flipped or else the machine starts to sputter away.<br>
<br>
  Cards I would Like to Add but can&#146;t find the Room:<br>
     Ghhhk<br>
     Masterful Move<br>
     Fett in Ship<br>
     There&#146;ll be Hell to Pay<br>
     Reactor Terminal (may be neccasarry since trackin cards you need may be difficult if your constantly looking in reserve deck for Chevins.)<br>
<br>
<br>
  Matchups: (Many Matchups are &quot;cut&amp;paste&quot; from Steven Lewis&#146; Invincible Court Deck. Thanks To Him.)<br>
<br>
  VS. Watch Your Step:<br>
  Start Secret Plans instead of TINT/OE. These decks rely on battling and retrieval, so you should do just fine. Use the Set For Stuns, Dengar, and Guri to handle any Palace Raiders and heavy starships. Also, your interior sites will be havens for you, so drain from them as quickly as you can. This can be a tough matchup, but you will usually come out on top.<br>
<br>
  VS. EBO<br>
  Let your ground drains do lots of early damage. S&amp;D will be very effective in this game. Fight his ships if you can, but if hes playing X-wings (or anything swarmish) then be very cautious of a beatdown. The heavy ground damage can usually control this game, but in case it doesnt, go to space in force. This is the toughest matchup, but play smart and youll do fine.<br>
<br>
  VS. Hidden Base<br>
  Hutt Influence is necessary in this game. You can fight pretty good in space, but watch out for barriers and beatdowns (which would be the only way you lose this game). Dont worry about probing the base since he cant cancel your drains anyway. You will win this game almost every time, as long as you dont get beatdown.<br>
<br>
  VS. Any LS Deck I Didn&#146;t Mention<br>
  Just play smart and youll win.<br>
