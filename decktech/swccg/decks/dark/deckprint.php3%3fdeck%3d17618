I know it&#146;s gone if executor dies, but it just makes the setup sooo much faster (piett deploys -2 to executor).<br>
<br>
Editor&#8217;s Note 1: (in response to reviews) yes i know i<br>
 could drain for more at sullust.  However it takes up a<br>
 card slot that I need, and if I dont get merrejk then I <br>
really dont need another ZERO floating around in my deck.  <br>
I can drain for enough as it is and trying to control four <br>
systems is ridiculous.  (with chiraneau and rumors I can <br>
drain for 11 per turn, plus 1 at the db).<br>
<br>
Editor&#8217;s Note 2: to &#8217;Jet Nkik&#8217;: YOU DUMBA$$! Do you even <br>
know what Imperial Command does? If you did you wouldn&#8217;t <br>
tell me how WYS and QMC are going to rip me up in space.  <br>
QMC has crappy activation, slow setup, crappy drains, <br>
expensive ships, and I have already included a matchup <br>
sectionw for this.  If you took time to read the strategy <br>
section you would understand.  It is beyond me how you got <br>
the 1570 rating required for reviews, judging by the <br>
intelligence you have shown in your review.  And Mon <br>
Calamari is a better choice than Kashhykk or Sullust <br>
because:<br>
1) I can only be drained for one.<br>
2) I don&#8217;t give my opponent two force (Sullust).<br>
<br>
Editor&#8217;s Note 3: to &#8217;zmanthe 1st&#8217;: I never said RST didn&#8217;t have lots of characters or lots of starships, I said they were weak.  You may have 15 characters, but most of them are power 1 or 2 scouts, and you may have 10 ships but most of them are like tala 1 or tala 2 or gold squadron 1.  im sooo scared, corporal beezer corporal delevar, corporal midge, brooks carlson, lieutenant blount, and crix madine vs.  darth maul.  please don&#8217;t hurt me you big mean person.<br>
<br>
**********************************************************<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ve been having some problems with dark side <br>
lately, mainly finding a deck that wins.  The <br>
biggest problem for dark side was activation, and <br>
I was too lazy to think up something new, so I <br>
went looking for a deck that starts a <br>
battleground system.  This is it.  This deck has <br>
the activation, it has the power, it has the <br>
drains, and it has enough tech.  Oh yeah no grabbers,<br>
 I just dont like them.  In case your <br>
opponent plays don&#8217;t do that again, just drop a <br>
bounty hunter ship to endor first turn.  Hence <br>
the 2x Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and 3x Operational<br>
 as Planned.  Light Side has been weak in space <br>
lately, obviously. Anyway here&#8217;s how the deck <br>
works:<br>
<br>
Turn 1 if opponent plays DDTA: activate. pull a <br>
db, pull ominous rumors, then drop a ship to <br>
endor if you can.  Pull Executor.  Problem solved.<br>
<br>
Turn 1 if he doesn&#8217;t:  pull executor, get an <br>
admiral (probably piett) with an imp. command.  <br>
activate.  pull a db.  deploy piett.  pull <br>
merrejk.  deploy merrejk if possible.  pull a <br>
system.<br>
<br>
You should follow the same game-plan in just <br>
about every game except maybe against MBO and <br>
RST, just so you can stop them blowing up the <br>
Death Star or the bunker you can go to yavin 4 <br>
and kill all their guys with the Dark Jedis.  <br>
Fun.  Presence of the Force is your best friend <br>
then.  In most other games you will pull out <br>
piett and merrejk, set up docking bay activation, <br>
pull out systems put ships at the systems, set up <br>
ominous rumors and start draining.  Smash your <br>
opponent if he comes to space.  There are two <br>
landing claw cancellers in there and the AO&#8217;s are <br>
golden.  Most of the time they&#8217;ll make the <br>
opponent&#8217;s starships power -2, plus they let you <br>
pull out your walkers.  You&#8217;ve got a great anti-<br>
scrub team in darth maul and DLOTS, great for <br>
holding the bunker, running around and killing <br>
random people, whatever you need them for.  Darth <br>
Maul is great in space, especially against crap <br>
like ten nunb superstar or x-wings.  Too bad I <br>
have to borrow Darth Mauls at every tournament.  <br>
This is a solid balanced deck.  Avatar&#8217;s version <br>
was good, but unfortunately walkers can&#8217;t go in <br>
the bunker, which means it will be blown up.  <br>
Also I believed it was weak in space which is why <br>
there are more ships in this post-tatooine <br>
version.  Anyway, here&#8217;s some reasons for my card <br>
choices:<br>
<br>
<br>
Operational As Planned x3:  I just like it.  Plus <br>
it helps you get a bh ship first turn if they <br>
play DDTA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Control/SFS: Goodbye, Captain Han.  Goodbye, Ten <br>
Nunb.  Whoever&#8217;s annoying you.  Crix Madine is <br>
always a fun target for SFS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trample:  YAY!! kill people that mess with your <br>
db.  what a cool card. great for puny scouts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter x2:  Well it&#8217;s good, and <br>
it&#8217;s cheap, and you can put it out first turn <br>
with an operation as planned.  Cool.<br>
<br>
Umm I&#8217;m hoping the rest of the card choices are <br>
fairly obvious.  If something isn&#8217;t, just ask me.<br>
<br>
Ok, matchups.  (for most decks start secret <br>
plans, only against the pile or hb mains start <br>
the SAC killer)<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  RST podracing: yay you get completely free <br>
reign of space.  you&#8217;re gonna lose the podrace, <br>
so don&#8217;t sweat it, it&#8217;s not that big a deal, <br>
because they won&#8217;t be able to use the second part <br>
of I did it.  Just stop them blowing the bunker <br>
at [almost] all cost.  If they&#8217;re podracing, <br>
they&#8217;ll be weak on characters.  The space drains <br>
will kill them.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  RST done right.  oh good you don&#8217;t have to <br>
worry about the podrace, just worry about the <br>
bunker [a bit] more and you&#8217;ll be fine.  Darth <br>
Maul is your best friend in the bunker, if you <br>
have him put him there, if you don&#8217;t have him, <br>
get him.  If you&#8217;re playing against someone who <br>
is not Brian Hunter playing this deck, there is a <br>
high possibility of beating it.  If Brian Hunter <br>
is playing RST done right, then im probably <br>
screwed considering the fact that he&#8217;s the numero <br>
uno player in the world. But it&#8217;s still <br>
possible.  They give you some force which helps a <br>
lot, but the ships are puny and you should be <br>
able to pound anything that comes to space.  If <br>
you have darth vader in your hand put him to the <br>
bunker and then put darth maul at crix&#8217;s site to <br>
neutralize the big pile of scouts they&#8217;ll have <br>
sitting there.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  HB mains: wowsers, they have crap for drains <br>
and you can stop their retrieval with your <br>
effects.  If you stick to the docking bay on the <br>
ground you&#8217;ll be fine, and your drains in space <br>
will overwhelm them.  Same thing for the pile and <br>
other mains decks.  Space is limited to the <br>
falcon and the spiral and stuff like that, so <br>
opposition there will be VERY limited.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  any kind of X-wings:  Battle Deployment, <br>
Battle Order and Darth Maul wrecks.  Next.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  MBO: go to yavin 4 and kill scrubs.  kill <br>
random ships in space.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  the PILE:  hey cool, force denial.  just <br>
play cautiously and stay mostly in space.  you&#8217;ll <br>
win. watch out for jar-jar or revo beatdowns at <br>
the dbs, though.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  QMC:  start secret plans.  set up as usual <br>
and take over bespin when needed.  SFS and darth <br>
maul are golden as always and you can basically <br>
ignore their guys at cloud city.  as always the <br>
ominous rumors/chiraneau drains will be <br>
overwhelming.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok that&#8217;s all the matchups i could think of for <br>
now.  Hope you had a good read, and I would <br>
appreciate good advice in reviews.<br>
