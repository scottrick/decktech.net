----DECK EDIT---- I accidently said &#148;Combined Attack&#148;, I meant &#148;Precise Attack&#148;, sorry &#146;bout that.<br>

<br>
***STRATEGY TIME BOYOS***<br>
-This deck should be re-named &#148;so-tech-deck&#148;. Why didn&#8217;t they make an objective that basically says &#148;Lando and Han are out of play for entire game&#148;... oh wait.. they did and it&#8217;s called Carbon Chamber Testing. I love this deck; not only is it fun but it wins! Don&#8217;t be so pesimistic until you try it, it&#8217;s cool!<br>
<br>
-EARLY GAME- Pull Rendili first and if Lando&#8217;s not in your hand go get him with the prison&#8217;s text and if Lobot&#8217;s not in your hand, go get him with A Real Hero&#8217;s text. Deploy them both simultaneously first turn and all of a sudden, Lando for lightside can&#8217;t be played! Ha ha ha... sorry I&#8217;ll calm down. If it&#8217;s safe, deploy them together at Carbon Chamber for the little drain or at the prison if you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s safe. Remember: A Real Hero adds 2 battle destiny when they&#8217;re together on cloud city and you got plenty. You got barriers too just in case.<br>
<br>
Get out Audience Chamber from your reserve deck first so you can get out Jabba and the gang wit Power of da Hutt. Have one of your droids move Han along for the flip (pray they don&#8217;t play 3p0 and r2 combo). <br>
<br>
-MID GAME-<br>
Your generation will be huge with Mob points and all your locations which are deployed from reserve deck. This is awesome since your stuff deploys so cheap wit Scum, you know what that means, BEATDOWN time. Battle and retrieve 3 and they lose 1 and it&#8217;ll cost &#8217;em 1 to use an interrupt. Now this is where the tech comes in. As you were moving your droid to flip, you had plenty of time to draw up, so you should have the battle stuff you need. All the mains they have left are mostly Jedi left on the ground. Plop down Dr.E combo, a destroyer droid, another guy with gun (another destroyer, dengar, etc.), and Dannick Jerricko on a lone Qui-gon or Obi. Use Combined Attack and link your guns to hit him, he&#8217;s lost with Dr.E, then he&#8217;s out of play with Jerricko! Oh my! What a tech combo! Then use Boba and everyone else to erradicate the remaining guys.<br>
<br>
-LATE GAME- Your objective lets you retrieve one, your battles your retrieving three, and your superiority of characters should wipe the table clean of any who question the power of a good Scum deck. You will (8.9 times out of 10) come out with the &#148;W&#148;. Have a nice day.<br>
<br>
EDITORS NOTE- your space is strictly to cause them massive amounts of pain and throw them off, not to hold systems so don&#8217;t try it! A pro QMC or WYS will kick you off the system eventually. Use your ships to kill theirs and come back when they deploy more, don&#8217;t try to hold it! Let the battles slowly pick off what they have left.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
---I would normally do card choices but the tech should be so clear to you, I mean, just look at the deck... wow, it&#8217;s pretty cool ain&#8217;t it? I totally doubted the power this deck has over character removal and domination, it&#8217;s fantastic! Just give it a wirl and have fun with it! I appreciate all you guys with critiques and reviews, I like feed-back! THANX hommies!<br>
