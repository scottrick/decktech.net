You capture left and right and trash them it is just a great old school realy fun deck to play!<br>
<br>
I really dont have a huge strategy for this deck, it is vey basic, you just get your characters out and thrash them. You capture and place there people out of play and retrieve massive for the entire game!Well it the basic game start out by droping some guys to the AC and find somewhere to battle them then capture a character of ability more than 2 flip and you are set,( I have captured 3 people in one battle b4, Snoova, Dengars gun, and hidden weapons, it can ruin there day) then you start eating retrieving and play ou of pay for a majr hurt. Vader and 3 characters with power 3 and one bounty hunter is sweet, power 24 plus your bounty hunters power then you capture feed and retrieve! that is what you do the whole game,  5 simple steps, battle, beatdown, capture, feed, retrieve, if you have bounty you can retrieve half your deck on the right characters!<br>
<br>
Why nothing past Jabbas Palace, b/c old school cards rock, and this is just a fun deck to play!<br>
<br>
Why do I not have dengar with gun vader with saber, b/c I dont want to put them in, this is as old as I could get it and I like it how it is, yes snoova is in this deck but she is a capturing machine, Judo Cast is a killer with hidden weapons so he is in there along with fett and mandalorian armor.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows disarmed/ Evzan combo that is sweet, it has been since the beggining!<br>
<br>
Trap door is under estimated, it can be very powerful, play it, grab Jedi Luke, Eat him, make them loose 9, you trieve 9, I dont see anything wrong with that.<br>
<br>
None shall pass is sweet, every Jabbas Palace deck needs this card, keep the big guys out!<br>
<br>
Evrything else is prety self explanitory, like i said OLD scholl, so everyone knows all about these old cards!<br>
<br>
For match ups, this is quick and simple!<br>
<br>
Everything Except space.......<br>
You play every game the same way, beat down and capture!!!, you have battle order to hurt their drain, and you wont be draing that much so it doesnt matter! you only drain at the end with Galid and your Jabbas Palace!<br>
<br>
Space<br>
The Objective will put the hurt on them, this is a harder one because you will have to face your own battle order and this is a drain game, yet they will have some ground, and those ground forces can be eaten!<br>
<br>
That is just about it, this is an old deck I know, dont take off stars if you are gonna review and say to old..I know it is old, it is just a fun deck, but this is not my only ds deck, I have another it is my hunt down deck with all the new cards and stuff so dont say move on this is old b/c I know that!<br>
<br>
thanks &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;<br>
