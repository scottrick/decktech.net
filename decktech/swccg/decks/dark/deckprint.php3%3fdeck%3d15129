Son of Vader: your a fuc.khead and this deck will kick yours easy with about 30 cards left in my deck. and i bet you really do think darth vader is your dad you need a life. your dad is really Ron &#148;the Hedgehog&#148; Jeremy.<br>
***********************************************************<br>
<br>
First of all this is an updated version of my bastardised dealings deck and I would like to thank Brian Hunter for his help.  I&#8217;m also opening bets that people rate this bad cause they dont understand it and Boba Fett Fan is odds on favourite cause hes a d!ckhead.<br>
<br>
Well I start with all that so i can get out my all my locations first turn except bespin cloud city cause you get out wakemuli, bespin, and the docking bay and plus you get out a card with crush generally evader/monnok.  you set up with vader at the walkway with stick and put like a dreadnought with ties at bespin and set up occupation by taking over the db with some other people but hopefully empy palpatine. so you can use crush. the admirals order is in there to help the weapons which take out the those pesky wys ships loaded with smugglers and it helps your immunity to attrition with it lord vader is power 7 defense 8 immune < 8 and when he swings it 2 destiny plus 4. dont forget that bespin in your control makes them deploy +1 to your sites. You can use cc occupation so they deploy a ship to bespin then beat down on it. Use the docking bay for the weaker characters to protect so you can react with a squad and get three force back and lose it and get another. plus you might wanna put a tie there incase they look like there coming so you can get the forfiet of three and ditch to the used pile.  So far I&#8217;ve won a tourny with this beating a deadbolt variant and that tj holman deck with the artoo threepio/hoth war room hdwgitm deck with it.  both by 24. you can rig destiny in this deck but this weekend at the tourny i couldnt be bothered and drew bad like half the time and still won. Ive lost once in playtesting cause of a real stupid mistake(damn pubcrawl and rebel barrier). It basically plays the same each time except if they put down hidden base and flip it you put sec precations and probe bespin then sit a tie at it and if they battle it just send it to the used pile. as for that tj holman deck i beat it cause I kept using monnok on him used and then now and again lost and just get it back with a tie and search for it with crush. Thanks to the objective it lets you start secret plans as a fourth effect so you can choose your own three which is very good considering that light trys to retrieve everygame. Thanx for constructive reviews incase anyone actually does.     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
