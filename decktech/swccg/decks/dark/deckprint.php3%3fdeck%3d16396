you. Youll manage to blow A in about 3-4 turns. So it will happen quite fast.<br>
There is a lot of ways to keep your force loss limited to what you can easily handle.<br>
Start with Battle Order in allmost every case, so early draining will cost.<br>
Strategic reserves will also help: get Gunner, cancel drain, deploy him, search for LASER<br>
and so on... youll end up stopping their best drain allmost every turn(untill you flip).<br>
<br>
When you finally flip, just start invading space. Play systems from reserve and begin to<br>
summon your tremendous fleet. There is a horde of destroyers so you should have no shortage<br>
for space power. Retrieving capabilities of this deck are awesome and allmost unmached!<br>
Keep destroyers coming! If opponent kills few, deploy more and retrieve and so on...<br>
<br>
Activation should not be a problem. With your Death Star and its sites you get a lot while<br>
your friend gets none. Also systems provide a bunch for you both. Mobilization points <br>
not includet, because they just get suspendet in early game when they are most usefull.<br>
<br>
Important! Remember when you flip you are no longer immune to battle damage at the moon.<br>
So gather your crew to avoid beatdowns!<br>
<br>
If opponent plays ground, he can attempt to take your DS-sites. This must be stopped!<br>
Many of your pilots are mains istead of whimpy admirals, so they can fight at ground also.<br>
And remeber to &quot;Put all sections on alert&quot;! <br>
<br>
In overall this deck focuses on heavy draining and even heavier retrieval and drain stopping.<br>
Play wise and patiently and you will win!<br>
<br>
Why not &quot;Imperial command&quot; deck??? Because of &quot;Dont do that again&quot; it gets grabbed very early.<br>
And quickly controlled Docking bays no longer provide huge activation. Also admirals arent<br>
very usefull in ground warfare. Multiple destinies is stopped by two Guris!<br>
<br>
Why not more DS-sites??? Because you want flip soon, and you dont want to have any zeros<br>
appearing as your destinies.<br>
<br>
If SAC is popularin your area, replace &quot;Oppressive Enforcement&quot; with the combo version.<br>
<br>
Some card explanations:<br>
<br>
Vader with saber: Best Vader for this kind of deck. No room for his saber.<br>
<br>
Captain Godlherdt: Anti Landing claw.<br>
<br>
Daroe: With the number of star destroyers he can(and will) suprise you opponent!<br>
<br>
Tarkins orders: Cancels a bunch of often played cards. Also can stop drains several times.<br>
<br>
And some matchups:<br>
<br>
WYS: Tricky. They will kill some of your activation, so be patient and gather force.<br>
You will retrieve/stop enough drains to survive of their early upperhand.<br>
Then eventually conquer space and the game is yours! Be sure to take each system with<br>
at least two destroyers(preferrably with 3-4!), incase they play beatdown verion.<br>
Crush them with your power! Guri will save you from their destinies. Battle deployment will help.<br>
<br>
QMC/RST: Easy. Take space. Win drain race! Your   retrieval will be to much for them.<br>
<br>
TIGH: 	Just see that your power is enough in battles and game is yours.<br>
<br>
Podracing: You have no podracer, because if they do Podracing you will lose the race.<br>
But no problem! Just retrieve damage what they have caused. I did it! wont hurt you too much!<br>
<br>
EBO: Take space and win. Destroy Hoth and smile! If they play swarm, keep your boats at<br>
groups and Battle deployment with Thrawn will eat their power.<br>
<br>
Profit:	Real drain race coming up with this deck. Their direct damage will hurt, <br>
but your draining and retrieval potial is higher so you should win.<br>
<br>
Mains: If they play docking bays use Fanfare. Theyll probably try take your sites, so be<br>
prepared to fight there. Kill them with drains!<br>
<br>
MBO: Take fight to Yavins ground. Kill their Assault run boosters and take their sites!<br>
Your mains will crush their weak characters. Destroy Yavin 4 and win!<br>
<br>
Thats about all I could remember. So thanks for your rewiews! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
