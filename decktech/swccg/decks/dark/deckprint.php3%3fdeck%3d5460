I made an error in the card list. It is supposed to include a Hutt Smooch instead of the third Hidden Weapons.<br>
<br>
Alright, before you review, please read all of this section. I submitted this deck to help improve it, so please, if you're review is only going to be 1 line, don't bother.<br>
<br>
Prior to anything else, I want people to know that every card in this deck has a purpose.<br>
<br>
Generally I start Surface Defense, so I start with Insert/SAC/Retrieval protection. The only real exception is Ops. Start (duh) battle order against Ops.<br>
<br>
<br>
As long as they come to Tatooine, you should be alright. The point of this deck is to just capture 1 or 2 key characters, retrieve for the bounty, then feed them to the Rancor. It actually works pretty well. Use Iggy/Hidden Weapons/Bossk/All Wrapped up to capture characters.<br>
<br>
Use your Twi-leks wisely. Generally I get All Wrapped Up first, but that can change as needed.<br>
<br>
I get Mara from reserve deck, and her Saber ASAP. That will establish a strong drain of 2 by turn 3 at the latest. Add that to the 1 per turn loss from the Objective, and it starts pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can figure out what else to do. Here's what I do against most decktypes:<br>
<br>
Profit:<br>
Start Jabba, Fett and Surface Defenses. Capture Luke and Ben if you can. Just fight and retrieve.<br>
<br>
MWYHL:<br>
Start Surface Defense. If they're training past 2, get out Endor and send Vader to interrupt their training. Twi-lek for Search and Destroy. Have the Bounty Hunters hold Tatooine, if they try to fight.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base:<br>
Start Security Precautions. 6 probing machienes. Don't go into space too early, and watch out for the beatdown. Tough game, but Direct Damage from the objective and Search and Destroy should do it for you.<br>
<br>
TRM:<br>
If no choke you should be fine. I have seen NO choke in my area, so I didn't include any Evaders or other Revo protection other than Alter. D*, Endor and Jabba's Palace should be enough generation. If they Revo the dungeon, they're screwed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think-<br>
