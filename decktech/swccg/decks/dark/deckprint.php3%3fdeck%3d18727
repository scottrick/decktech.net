I hoped to catch some people by surprise and i guess it worked. The objective is obviously about pressure so i think podracing is a natural part of it. As great as it is against opponents that dont race, you will prolly lose the race against a dedicated light podracing deck thoughSo you should allways start the box if opponent does not race and another effect against racing. Either There is no try if you suspect SAC or Blast door controls against WYS for example. Allways, ALLWAYS flip first turn if you can. Watto deploys for free and might deploy from reserve so you got 6 force at least to deploy one other character at mos espa. I play 2 Televan Korreys cause he´s a god in your starting hand. Flipping for free is the @#$%. <br>
Don´t reinforce your base (junkyard and mos espa) unless your opponent pays for it. If they come for you, beat em up. Else go to their place and beat em up. If they come for you with too much you can handle, let them drain and make em missing. Never put your best card face down for them to pay it,  cause they wont at times. Unless your desperate of course. <br>
<br>
This deck has a good chance of loosing to decks that utilize AFA, like Dagobah or cheese profit because they can allways pay 2 instead of losing 2. But it can win high against other stuff, like it won twice against Martin Falke, by 31 and 33 and in the final against Peter di Biasio by 38.<br>
