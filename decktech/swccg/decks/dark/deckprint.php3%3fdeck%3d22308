<br>
First off, I&#146;d like to say that the new freakin virtual blaster rack freakin kicks hiney in this deck! What a great idea it was. Kir Kanos and Myn Kyneugh both add a destiny with their Force Pikes and now you can deploy them together! This rules! <br>
<br>
This deck is strictly to play off the other players battle grounds, it will have alot of trouble with cheese decks and light decks that try force denial. This is a force denial beatdown deck that has come into it&#146;s own once I saw the new Blaster Rack. You play on their battle-grounds and waste them with raw power and some serious tech.<br>
<br>
To start you wanna get Emperor down to one of their main sites, pull I Have You Now and maybe one of his thugs (Janus or Sim). Keep Janus and Sim with him at all times if possible! An early grip on their sites is vital! Trust me, they won&#146;t beat you down cause they can&#146;t, you have to much backup. Wait a couple turns to see if they deploy Luke. If they do, use Dr.E and disarmed and say good-bye, or have Jedi Killer Maul cut him down and add a bunch of destiny to waste him. If they&#146;re waiting to give him up, get Vader down with his saber and let Your destiny do it&#146;s thing for one, maybe two turns, or however long it takes for them to get Luke down. <br>
<br>
Don&#146;t worry when they fork him over, one less big guy to deal with. Then you can start battling and just draining on their locations and killing all their mains with the 2 killer Royal Guards who add destinys with their Pikes and good ole Dr.E and disarmed and if guys are hit they go away too. I guarantee you, if someone doesn&#146;t play Insurrection, they will die. Elis will take your thugs wherever their hearts content to woop anyone they choose.<br>
<br>
Your space force is made up of 3 quick assault, heavy hitting ships with some Lat Damage for help. 2x Zuckuss, 2x 4LOM, 2x Guri, 2x Stinger, and Dengar! Plus 2x Lat Damage! That should take their key systems quickly after they&#146;ve only deployed one or two select ships. You definetely want to wait until they&#146;ve deployed ships to retaliate, you want to kill. If you take over key systems (i.e. Tatooine-WYS, Bespin-QMC, Endor-RST,etc.) you will have dominance. Once you&#146;ve done that, try and get out Battle deployment to stop all their battle destiny adding at the sites down below. <br>
<br>
Don&#146;t worry about activation, you&#146;ll get it. Janus will help you get all your locations out as you play off them. Remember, you&#146;ll need the time to plan you counterattacks carefully anyway, so by that time you&#146;ll have most of &#146;emm out.<br>
<br>
<br>
----OKIE DOKIE FELLAS----<br>
All you pimps who rule tell me what ya think! If you play right you will come out on top! Review closely and you&#146;ll find some tricks that I didn&#146;t mention. THANX for all of you who took time to review! All praise and critique is welcome and may the force be with ya&#146;ll homefries!<br>
