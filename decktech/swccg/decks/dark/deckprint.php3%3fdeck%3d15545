<br>
I always liked this objective, but every time I would see someone play it they had very <br>
few characters and lots of interupts. I love to battle. So, this deck can bring the forces <br>
and if they dont come to you. You can go to them or hit them with Ability,A,A for <br>
more damage. Capturing is not required, but if you pull it off once or twice that could <br>
be the game. <br>
<br>
First turn get out baby Jabba or the Barge and just take the force loss. Its only 1 <br>
force!! Not a huge deal and will probably be a card retrived anyways. Try and get <br>
Scum set up right away w/Gailid for the added drains. You can deploy ships from you <br>
reserve. So, DO IT!! Battle with them and retrieve them and then pull them out again <br>
next turn. Pretty basic there. <br>
<br>
Card Explanations:<br>
Hutt Smooch to get a spy out of JP or capture them! Expand the AC to pull more <br>
aliens from you reserve. Tired of Ben Kenobi bringing people back to life..battle <br>
w/him and 4-Lom and eat their soup of Ben or Luke or whomever. Snoova gets to <br>
capture guys and throw them in the pit. <br>
<br>
Decks<br>
<br>
vs. WYS<br>
Set up normal trying to get scum and the Barge. Capture his character and throw them <br>
in the PIT! That should take care of them deploy outside of the Cantina. Throw the <br>
other guy in the Pit w/the Sarlacc and lots of guys on the Barge laughing to make him <br>
lose force and you retrieve. That will be 5 for a Raider, 9 for Luke, 6-9 for Han, 6-8 <br>
for Dash, 8-10 for Wedge. Does this sound too good to be true? Nope. Make them <br>
keep deploying to one site or lose force w/A,A,A. You spread and drain. Go to <br>
space w/Dengar and another ship. Kill them off. Should be able to keep up. Might be <br>
a close game if you make a mistake, but you should win.<br>
<br>
vs. HB Mains<br>
Find those NSP cards and get those going. Make sure to capture a character and <br>
throw them in. If they dont come to you. Youre drains w/Gailid, Court Damage, and <br>
A,A,A should keep them from doing too much. You have one grabber. Grab there <br>
retrieval card. Should be able to beat this deck.<br>
<br>
vs. EBO<br>
Time to see how good you are in space. No Decree means youll have to battle. They <br>
will let you do anything you want for awhile. So, get JPs working and Court Damage. <br>
If they dare drop an EPP character. Capture him!! That will hurt them a TON! A,A,A <br>
might not do too much, but in the beginning it might be huge. Pull ships from reserve <br>
and fight them in space. Close game, but very winnable.<br>
<br>
vs. TRM (neo or old school)<br>
Not a huge deal. Just grab their retrieval card. This will have lots of battles. So, use <br>
that to your advantage. If you can get the Sarlacc going all the better. Should be a <br>
interactive game w/your retrieval -edging- them out.<br>
<br>
vs. Profit<br>
I usually Start Jabba to get stuff to come down real cheap, and either Snoova or EPP <br>
Fett. Just keep them out of JP and Han under wraps. Or go with a Jade, Snoova start <br>
and move out of the AC for a turn later w/Jabba and Fett deploying there. Watch out <br>
for Sorry about the Mess, OrderToEngage. Should be able to out retrive and cause <br>
some nice drains in this game with all your characters. You will surely have more than <br>
them to deploy and beat them out of there. Another good game w/interaction. Should <br>
be able to win. <br>
<br>
vs. TIGIH<br>
Well, no Vader means no grabbing luke and you dont have the T:DB. So, they will <br>
have to use it to come over. If they are playing Endor scouts. Drop and attack them, <br>
retrieve, repeat. Capturing Luke is nice w/Jade and then dropping him in the Pit for a <br>
big 9! OOP..hmm..nice objective now. Still a good game and probably not too much <br>
interaction. Keep them out of Space as I&#146;m sure Endor will hit the table. Control <br>
Endor, drain for free and that should be game. <br>
<br>
Cards considered<br>
This is a deck that I havent played with too much lately. So if you see something not in <br>
there that could be the reason. I still like bringing it out for fun and Im sure it will see <br>
some tournament action soon enough.<br>
Guri (I would probably find a slot for her somewhere)<br>
Twilek Advisor (for a total of 2)<br>
Secret Plans (for SURE!)<br>
Search and Destroy<br>
<br>
Well, thats about the jist of the deck. I hope you can make this fun and interactive <br>
deck to work for you. Any other questions feel free to email me. <br>
Thanks for looking<br>
