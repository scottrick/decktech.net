Add Chiraneu? I don&#8217;t play Star Destroyers moron. And Lateral Damage sucks, too much stuff cancels it now. <br>
<br>
Yes Clint, this deck loses when Battle Plan, Aim High, and OTE are out. But remember, I suck. Give me 5 next time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: Pull Emperors for another Presence of the Force and another Ghhhk combo card.<br>
<br>
Relentless Pursuit is tech! Better than Lateral Damage nowdays.<br>
<br>
This deck is fun and easy to play yet wins a lot of its games. Start TINT/Oppressive Enforcement, Secret Plans, and Mob Points. Just pull out your DS War room for activation and try and deploy systems. Also pull Wakeelmui and deploy SFS there. If you have Ghhhk, put a lone Tie to a drain 2 or 3 system (PotF) and wait. After you Ghhhk away damage from battle, just kill him with Ties and maybe a Dreadnaught. You get huge retrieval and decent activation plus Ties are not very expensive. Dreaded Imperial Starfleet cancels drains. Use Ghhhks so you can spread your forces. <br>
<br>
Vs mains <br>
just wait for them to deploy their small fleet and beat them down. All Power to Weapons with a group of 4-6 TIE&#8217;s is just awesome. 20-30 power, plus destiny, and immunity can take out whatever they have. Grab anything annoying. Retrievel win help get you a large differential and they can&#8217;t drain much (spies, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet). Late game Short Range Fighters wins game for you with your big drains. Remember to use AAA.<br>
<br>
Vs. aliens<br>
Not too hard. Depends though. Just spread and drain and Ghhhk. Then try to kill him from space and block their drains. You have added retrieval to win.<br>
<br>
Vs. speeders<br>
Easy. Spread, and then you get to have a drain race. You will win thanks to drain blocking and bigger drains. Just watch for any space he might have. If so, just battle anything he puts in space and make him lose for it.<br>
<br>
Vs. WYS<br>
Hardest of all. You need to use All Power to Weapons to protect you from the multiple destinies. Use spies and the effect to limit ground drains. Drain at your systems. Ghhhk whenever you are caught alone. Use your AO to cancel his. Shoot his guys down. Limit retrieval with Secret Plans. Play smart. Then you can win.<br>
<br>
Vs. Anything else<br>
Just try to win any space battles, retrieve, and drain. Not hard with all the retrieval and drain power. You can easily drain for around 4-6 a turn early in the game. They can&#8217;t really stop you either unless they pack SAC<br>
<br>
This deck is good. It&#8217;s only lose happened when this guy played Revealed on my spies and then beatdown a lone TIE with a super Falcon and I had no Ghhhk. <br>
