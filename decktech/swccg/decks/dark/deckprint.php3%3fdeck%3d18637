I&#146;ll throw out Sullust though for Endor, I didn&#146;t consider it before. Yes I know I should use Chinerau. Vader?s Cape is for Watto to be a little defended, but instead, I?ll throw in Mandalorian Armor for it. Fine, I know you Chrinerau freaks are still thinking about him, so I?ll make you happy and throw out Bespin for the Admiral. There! Happy? Are you satisfied? Jk.<br>
<br>
OK, some of my reviews said that the ground was weak, so I threw out the Lightsabers and the Force Lightnings for some more stronger characters like Iggy with Riot Gun to capture some annoying character, Boba Fett with Blaster for shooting down some character, and Gragra as the None Shall Pass for Mos Espa. As stated in my other decks, pull Executor (Mob. Points), Watto to His Junkyard (Junkyard Text). Then deploy a * character down to Espa and flip, pull down some cards and make him lose some Force, then, at some point, put down the free Executor and bluff it so its some ground character and if he pays 2, then you?ll pull out a free Executor! Yipee! <br>
<br>
	When He?s getting tough if the air, pul down cards to deploy in space, if he refuses, maike him lose 2, then pull down more, he?ll soon let you deploy. Yes, some people don?t like this objective or they don?t like the way I use it, but if used right, You?re A Slave is definately broken. This is one way I think it works and I will play this until I find a weakness, which likely there is none. I think, since alot of people are playing WYS, which is a space/land deck, this deck could be considered somewhat a Dark Side WYS.<br>
<br>
	Except there?s no limit to what you can deploy. This deck will counter WYS I believe, and maybe even defeat it. Try it out, I know it works really against any deck, except maybe X-Wing Swarm, which I hate so much, cause They could swarm my deck. Thank you for your reading, as new expansions come out, the more this deck could become more powerful, or maybe even weaker. Thank You for your reviews, I appreicate them. Enjoy and Keep Improving...
