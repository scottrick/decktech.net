In order to keep hotj from taking effect there are 3 battleground docking bays.  so there.  I added cc docking bay because you can&#146;t get to cc otherwise and i thought it would prove useful.<br>
<br>
here&#146;s a few of the strategies with the cards.  Force lightning will keep emperor alive.  don&#146;t take luke until you are ready to either beat them severely in battle or are ready to have him turn to the dark side.	If you do you will be causing yourself an unneccesary force loss.<br>
<br>
here are some of the matchups:<br>
<br>
vs. profit<br>
<br>
start an alien by all means! get mara down there, back her up with emperor turn one and try to get bubo out asap.  battle them on tattoine, if they are generating a super drain at a site put u-3po there that&#146;s what he is there for.  once they spread to drain make them pay and slaughter the living crap out of who is left.  if you think the game through you should win unless you just get severly overplayed which happens to everyone.  not a guaranteed win, but really there never is a guaranteed win.<br>
<br>
vs. rebel strike team<br>
<br>
take over the system. don&#146;t let them flip.  battle those scouts to oblivian.  turn luke if you feel so inclined.  win this.<br>
<br>
vs. there is good in him<br>
<br>
be careful here, and don&#146;t be too rash.  pick and chose your battles, and if they set up drains, either begin slowing drains down, outdraining them or slaughter the living crap out of the drainers.  take luke only when you absolutely need him, and always use vader to do it.<br>
<br>
vs. ebo and hidden base<br>
<br>
good luck, battle wisely in space try to drain and cause direct damage, be very careful during these games.  if hb flips probe them till you get it.<br>
<br>
basically with all these matchups or any others you need to think them out thoroughly.	this deck can not be explained, because it isn&#146;t the same for everyone.  This is a hard deck to perform well with if you don&#146;t have experience playing it, get used to it and change things around to fit your playing style so bhbm can perform best for you.  thanks  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
