I sent the first one and I realized that dueling all in all wasn&#146;t really worth it. Once again, I&#146;d like to state that this is my first shot at a Hunt Down deck. I know it still needs alot of work so please, give me helpful constructive criticism. <br>
<br>
Anyway, you use Prepped D to pull YCHF/MP, POTH, Fear Is My Ally, and Crush. On your first turn, you pull Carida with MP, then send YCHF combo to lost pile for IAO/SP. Then you use that to pull the Ex:db. Then, use POTH to smack down Mon in the middle of your 3 Ex sites so it becomes a spy free zone. When you get Sidious out, deploy him to the same place. This way he&#146;s safe and you can knock his Jedi out of play one by one (this is especially useful against the ever so famous Lightsaber Combat decks that are running around right now). Anyway, you basically play the deck like a beatdown deck (least....that&#146;s how I think you should play Hunt Down). Deploy straight to your opponent&#146;s sites and lay the beats while he&#146;s in the middle of setting up his own strategy. Use Bad Feeling Have I and Barrier to stall your opponent&#146;s mains and reinforcements. <br>
<br>
As for the air? It&#146;s quite solid when it&#146;s all bundled up in the same place. With Carida out so early Lateral Damage really helps out in space. I know what you&#146;re all thinking: Lightsaber Combat will rape me. To tell you the truth, it doesn&#146;t walk all over this deck as easy as you might think. The battle droids in here were mean to kill Jedi, and they&#146;re pretty good against other things too. One of them severely decreases their defense value which allows your destroyer droids to move in and fire with Twin Cannons. I know, lightsabers are very nasty weapons, but thanks to Oh Switch Off they&#146;re not nearly as deadly, removing your droids from the possible targets available. Then you use There They Are! to give them a nice power bonus. Fett with Iggy is deadly. 3 battle destiny draws. Backed up with the destroyer droids that jumps to a 5 (one of them draws if unable to otherwise and the other one adds one). Not even Jedi can stand up to that much power without faltering. Then, as you knock them out one by one you place them out of play with Sidious, limiting his character base to scrubs. You could use Vader, but it aint really a smart thing to do. Keep him at a bg site away from where the main front is (preferably the Battle Plains). <br>
<br>
This way, you can quicken the pace of death for the Light Side. If he does deploy to the air, knock him out with yours. LS combat usually doesn&#146;t focus much on space so you shouldn&#146;t have much of a problem there. Blizzard 4 can also help out, giving you alot of extra power on the ground. Also, keep an eye out for Rebels. If your opponent&#146;s got a Reb main at the front lines then go ahead and risk the Maul with stick. With I Have You Now you can pack an even bigger punch. If you track right, your battle destinies will be insane and you might even hit a few Jedi. You Are Beaten is good too. Don&#146;t expect the Maul to last though. Once he goes down, come Light Side&#146;s move phase and he&#146;s screwed. But until then, slice, dice, and attack. Against any other deck, you shouldn&#146;t have nearly as much trouble (well, maybe WYS). Anyway, you basically play the deck offensively, beating down all your opponent&#146;s characters and then draining at his remaining sites. Again, I&#146;d like to state that this is merely a 2nd version with slight adjustments. I could really use advice from everyone in their reviews. Thanks for reading. <br>
