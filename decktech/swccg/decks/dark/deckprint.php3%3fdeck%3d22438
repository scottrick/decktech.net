<br>
also this deck isnt virtual card updated...  i tell you this - that blaster rack helps this deck bigtime, and major modifications can be made to include ponda baba&#146;s blaster and shizzzzz its hot. lata<br>
<br>
<br>
This deck was made to beat LS combat, which it does.. steve, justin, hayes, eric and i went ot a tourney in albany, and hayes, eric and brad reinhold all played LS combat, and this beat their version with out a problem.. so that is why this deck was built. plus its fun.<br>
<br>
First off, i know people think 14 sevens is bad, but its just more fun that way.  Plus pinned down!<br>
<br>
Okay so people cant leave the battle, if they do and cancel it, you draw a seven and they lose seven.  THe guns that work with this are, dengar&#8217;s, boba&#8217;s and aurra&#8217;s none of the other guns like p59 or IG or anything like that, so dont get confused please. <br>
<br>
basically with this deck you drop and beat, they cant run away. so theyre stuck dealing with aurra&#8217;s sick gun, or pretty much just getting shot anyways because you can hit anyone, even quigon.  <br>
<br>
why five of her gun?? read pinned down, its a seven, why not?? you only need one of her so who cares.<br>
<br>
Sebulba&#8217;s pod is in there cause you have mad sevens.<br>
<br>
zuckuss is enough for space because him, 4lom, emporeres power, you just have to win a battle or two.. this beat hidden base flip played by a top100 in the world player.<br>
<br>
just get vader down. if they give you luke fine.. just go win battles. if you&#8217;ve ever read my bring him up the anus, its the exact same strategy.. all of the guys in this deck add destiny with each other for the most part and i just like p59 for the direct damage and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
i&#8217;m not saying this is the best deck in the world but it is a pretty fun deck and it wins games in the hand of a good player.. i ahvent posted in a while and this is the best deck ive made recently and it helped me in a tournament where i beat hayes and eric hunter, as well as steve baroni and got me to 1942 rating.. which is huge. <br>
<br>
so i hope you like it enough.. later yo<br>
<br>
i actually made this deck!<br>
