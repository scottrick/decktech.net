I changed The playing Style to fit me though.<br>
<br>
First Turn:<br>
Pull Rendili, Pull DS2 Docking Bay (or executer Docking Bay if thats in your hand), Pull Emperor, Pull Emperors Power. Deploy Emperor to Docking Bay. Let them go. draw if there is any force left over. If opponent gives you 3 force also deploy Miyoom.<br>
<br>
Second Turn:<br>
Deploy Endor Docking Bay, and Hopefully Vader There. Hopefully if you have enough force scan there hand with miyoom. Draw any leftover force or deploy characters if you dont suspect a beatdown.<br>
<br>
After That you are set for the game. Just use Miyoom every turn and if they have any dangerous doubles use a monnok. Force Drain at the two good sites, and make them lose force fromyour destiny. If they give you luke WIn Battles Fast, annd take him up to emperor so taht you can dual him and make him lose 3 force. this deck runs lke a machine and it seems rather good to me.<br>
<br>
Now on to the reasons for specific cards:<br>
Id just as soon kiss a wookie- this card is amazing. It has saved me many times. My favorite was when i used it to return obi to someones hand then barrier leia, and battle a lone han.<br>
<br>
Barrier- Same as above.<br>
<br>
Masterful Move- Recyclable 6&#146;s that let you get out monnok.<br>
<br>
Monnok- deal with those Dastardly Doubles (sounds like the old batman doesnt it)<br>
<br>
Sarkli- a great card. can help you win many games. broken<br>
<br>
Miyoon- Duh....prolly one of the most broken cards in the game. what was decipher on when the made this.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
tigih:<br>
Deploy vader. sarkli to hut. stop everything that they trown at you. win.<br>
<br>
Profit:<br>
tough. start mara, and fett. deploy vader,and his goonies. stop everything. win.<br>
<br>
MWYHL:<br>
Dont deploy a battle ground. use miyoom to get rid of that impending main beatdown. then deploy. if they play doubles get rid of them. S+D will wear them down. win.<br>
<br>
HB:<br>
Deploy Rendili. Battle there ships with your superior destinies. use lateral damage. probe. sec precs. win.<br>
<br>
QMC:<br>
Not much of a problem. just hold them off. WIn.<br>
<br>
Thats it. i hope you like my deck. any help would be great<br>
