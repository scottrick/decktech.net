<br>
It plays fairly straightforward. To start pull Rendili from your deck before you draw. Pull a docking bay first turn and play Rendili too, so you’ll have some place for your bounty hunter ships to drain. Protect your docking bays and utilize the extra generation to fill your hand often enough to get Vader down. Flip and drain, wait for them to come to you. <br>
<br>
Card specific strategies:<br>
<br>
Honor Of The Jedi-No Escape isn’t included in the deck because this decks point is to battle. So you wonder , how do you get rid of Honor? Simple, it’s only immune to alter while they occupy a battleground. So battle them off thier site and Alter Honor off the table. This serves two purposes, first you cause them battle damage and attrition, next you return to causing them direct damage every turn.<br>
<br>
Why E-3PO?- Well I’m glad you asked. It will help ruduce your opponents Threepio WHPS’s usefullnes drastically. For one used force every turn they can’t use that little creep! That is reason enough to use the droid in my book.<br>
<br>
Why not Executor?- Well for one reason alone, if I were to run the Executor and lose it in space I’d lose all my E-sites and my Visage.<br>
<br>
J’Quille- He’s there to take Chewbacca out of a fight before I have to deal with something like Wookie Strangle. The more times I can Keep a character from contributing to a battle the better off I’ll be.<br>
<br>
Darth Maul- Blocks drains almost as well as an undercover spy, but with the added benefit of adding to a drain and draining right through your opponent’s charaters at a site. This dude’s a total hoser when it comes to WYS or RST.<br>
<br>
Why no Emperor Papatine?- Sure he’d beef Mara way up, but then I’d have to lose something more usefull. Say like Guri who limits battle destinies. This a heavy battle version of Hunt Down, not a heavy dueler. You’ll see the latter after coruscant is out. Trust me.<br>
<br>
Sebulba?- He’s here to hose just like J’Quille. With these two at a site against scouts and Vader or Maul backing them up you know who’s going to win. Plus he kills Da’ Bomb (A.K.A. Jar Jar).<br>
<br>
Darth Vader’s and not Vader’s Lightsaber?- I know, I had to agonize over this one myself. It all came down to the decks purpose,win. And to do that I might occasionally have to duel and this saber will aid that duel. That’s the only reason.<br>
<br>
Matchups<br>
<br>
Watch Your Step- This deck comes looking for a Hunt Down. Traditionally Hunt Down isn’t much of a battler early on, but this one is. Most WYS are slighted to deal with Visage in one of two ways. The first is they run or start Honor. The second is Transmission Terminated. You can deal with these pretty well, all except Trans. Term. that is. J’Quille and Sebulba with Mara at the cantina are very tough to get rid of for your opponent. Also Set up your bounty hunter ships at Rendili before you move on to controlling Corelia, Kessel, or Tatooine. Don’t sparead your forces too thin either, they’ll rape you if you do. Just take it slow and beat them inch by inch.<br>
<br>
EBO- This one could give you problem with drains. Work on controlling space early and get Vader and your other heavy hitters down at docking bays to drain fast. If it turns into a drain race you should be the one left standing in the end.<br>
<br>
Profit- Very similar to WYS, except expect many more jedi. This will make duelling them out of play much easier, just watch out for jedi pressence.<br>
<br>
MBO- Cool. Invade and kill everything you see. Then turn to space in force. Remember to keep your drains going on the ground. In the end you’ll take the game by an average of +15.<br>
<br>
There Is Good In Him- Much the same as WYS, but expect to see a lot of sense. They get to start with a jedi on the table after all, way too much power if you ask me.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base- X-wing swarm will be tough to contend with, but possible.  Get to the ground and drain like a mad man. Hold your bounty hunter ships until you can deploy en-masse. If they start slow it ’s okay to drop Rendili and your guys there as soon as you get them. Just be watchful for anything cute like a new variant I’ve just seen. It’s Hidden Base With Kirdo III. They pull deserts, sandwhirls, and play matching operatives to sandspeeders!! The first time I saw this it spanked me hard. The second time I knew what was coming and still lost, but have changed the deck since to contend a little more with it. Beware this creative variant by Chocobo93.<br>
<br>
Quiet Mining Colony- The Lift Tube Escape version of this deck can be a little hard to deal with because they keep running away. Use your bounty hunter ships to clip the Falcons wings  and control the system. Look to control a site or two at Cloud City and shut down thier deck as fast as you can. If they flip be in store for a much harder game than you imagined. Against an experienced player you’ll need to be very careful. Just set up your drains and be prepared for the unexpected.<br>
<br>
As more decks become tested I’ll update the strategy and matchups sections.
