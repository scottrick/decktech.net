This is a deck I&#8217;ve been messing with since the day after Coruscant released. The deadly Watto&#8217;s box combined with the might of the Senate along with the one man wrecking crew of Maul.<br>
<br>
Start the race right away and flash them with Sebulba if they start Ani&#8217;s Pod. If they don&#8217;t start a racer, don&#8217;t bother using Sebulba&#8217;s game text and try to flip first turn. Your getting 5 force on your own so you should be able to drop 2 senators(ideally Lott Dod and any other you can afford). Maul should come out quick for free. <br>
Basic Strategy is to win the Podrace and it should be fairly easy with 4 podracer collisions. Spread and drain. If you lose control of the senate you can still win as you have a very potent ground force. In one game I had Maul against Qui-Gonn and after slicing him and playing Maul strikes they lost Qui and another 8!  <br>
Card breakdowns:<br>
Lott Dod is a machine with his built in Tunnel<br>
Watto at his junkyard with a little back up nets no destiny for opponent.<br>
Keder The Black: use carefully in conjunction with your probe droids to sniper off your opponents characters at the senate and get him back. If your not playing against the senate use him to block a nice drain.<br>
Maul Strikes: Just too good.<br>
Motion Supported: Bump up your drains<br>
Lana Dobreed: Swoop Maul to the Battle plains for an even bigger drain. <br>
P-59/60 can almost hold a site by themselves(watch out for Jar-Jar though)<br>
A small SAC package for emergencys<br>
There&#8217;s a lot of retrieval in this deck: Watto&#8217;s box, Rune Haako, Squabbling Delegates, Sith Probe Droids. <br>
The Phantom Menace: Harder to slice Maul<br>
You don&#8217;t need a whole lot of force for this deck and even if you find yourselve needing more remember you have lots of cards to give you your force: Neimoidian Advisor & We must accelerate our plans lets you pull sites, The point is conceded: activate a force, Tikkes: activate extra force. <br>
I know a well timed &#148;grimtaash&#148; could hurt but it&#8217;s expensive and you shouldn&#8217;t be holding too many doubles in hand.<br>
Closed Enviroment Deck Match ups:<br>
A dedicated Racing deck will be a little rough, use your interrupts wisely and you can pull it off. <br>
LS Senate: Be careful you don&#8217;t let yourself get beat down in the senate, Amidala, Palpatine and the wookie senator is a rough combo. Like I said, you can still win without being flipped. <br>
Hyperdrive Objective: Maul will own Qui-Gonn and if they&#8217;re lucky maybe they will flip before they lose :-)<br>
<br>
Please give me some good ideas on what should be changed in the deck.<br>
