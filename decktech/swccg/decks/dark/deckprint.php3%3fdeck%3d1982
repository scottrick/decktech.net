I also have the few big Capitols to take control of key systems, such as Bespin to shut down the ever so growing popular Quiet Mining Colony decks.  I have the Vaders to hit them when they try to spread out forces to FD...smack someone there with his stick and lose him to attrition and chances are he'll also cover battle damage then I'll retrieve him in the next few turns by deploying a TIE and repeat the process all over again.  U-3PO to block a really big drain that they have.  A few Ghhhks just in case.  A few Rouge Asteroids to make it all that much harder to come and battle me at Big One.  And last a Short Range Fighters just in case I happen to lose a bunch...more than I can retrieve in any reasonable amount of time.  If you have any advice to make this deck beter or any constructive criticism then I would be very happy if you would please post it for me.
