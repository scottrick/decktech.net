The obsidian squadron is the non unique tie i forgot to say tie on the end doh. and with it I think i should put in a dark manevours combo card to tallon roll and up the average destiny tell me what to take out or two even and another short range fighters. Happy Birthday Tito.<br>

Well with this deck you own bespin swarm with ties and use presence of the force and occupation to lure them then beatdown and get pride of the emperor going then you kill them with direct damage and drains and get odds happening. if they have insights dont worry you dont need odds to win. Ive playtested this quite a few times and i know how this works. this deck is now 6-0 in tourny play. Its main problem is activation but not really that bad because if they have no sites to drain at then they have to come to bespin which is real easy to kick em off cause you have two sites and both are controlled by dark jedi/I have you now. When Tatooine comes out i might mod it to get dark deal out and running with darth maul as my third dark jedi/site holder which will make this over powered. If you have questions dmail me im happy to talk about it.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
