Strategy:<br>
  In general the idea behind this deck is to keep your opponent off of Cloud City while you drain there. When he does comes down to play with ya, You&#146;ll be MAD ready to whoop his/her arse.<br>
  <br>
   Elimination #1 - You Start with jabba&#146;s Prize So, if you keep him protected, You dont have to worry about your opponent having Han on the table.<br>
   Elimination #2 - You can Pull Lando First Turn. Now, He is replaceable so you have to be careful. Possibly stick him in a Walker.<br>
   Elimination #3 - If you sit Vader and The Emperor at the Carbon Chamber and All Wrapped Up out on the table, Most Likely your opponent will THINK you are playing Emperor&#146;s Prize and will stay away cause he doesnt want you to capture Luke. <br>
   Elimination #4 - The Circle Is Now Complete will take care of Obi. vader will always win Unless your opponent use some sort of Destiny adder in the Duel. Dont Forget you can do the Duel DURING A BATTLE and have Grand Moff Tarkin Cancel his Destiny if needed.<br>
   Elimination #5 - All Too Easy will take care of another Character (any), maybe Leia if she Decides to come to the Carbon Chamber.<br>
   <br>
  Other things to do:<br>
    Pull Carida and set up a Space Drains with your Mini-Fleet<br>
    Grab any Retrieval in WYS with your Grabbers. (They Get VERY Annoying)<br>
    Merc Pilots - Putthem on the Patrol Craft and the Lift Tube for Extra Battle Destinies. <br>
<br>
  Matchups:<br>
   They are all basically the Same. Let Your Opponent Come To You! And when he does you squash him! <br>
   You may Want To Challenge him in space if he doesnt have too much<br>
