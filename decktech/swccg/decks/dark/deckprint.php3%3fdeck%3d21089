Once you&#8217;re set up, drop Mob Points combo for Search and Destroy unless you are having trouble activating or can&#8217;t get your two sites nailed.  If your opponent doesn&#8217;t feel like playing on the ground, send Vader to Endor, Maul or whoever to Cloud City to take advantage of Crush limiting destiny.  Those plus Carida give you three nice battlegrounds, enough to satisfy Battle Plan.  <br>
<br>
I love the combos you can set up with BHBM, its so crazy.  Drop The Emperor at the Throne Room and put Xizor with him if your opponent is a little hesitant to put Luke out, that also gives you some Throne Room protection.  This attrition bonus will win battles, especially with Emperor&#8217;s Power and all the other crazy stuff you&#8217;ll be doing.  Win enough battles, you can cross Luke over fairly easily...but getting him to the Throne Room fast could be trouble.  that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a lift tube in here, put it at the DS2 docking bay.  you capture Luke at a Docking Bay, transfer to DS2 DB, slide along on the lift tube, and you can get in a quick duel and try crossing him...but only if there are enough cards on Insignificant Rebellion (duh...).  but often your opponent will see this set up, give you Luke to make you flip and start losing, but never go to the ground again so you can&#8217;t win more battles.  Once you&#8217;ve got Luke bring him to the Throne Room anyway, and perform my favorite combo: Force Lightning and Young Fool the little brat into nirvana and be done with him.  Of course crossing him over is better, but this is easier and a little more fun because you get to finish the game the regular way without worrying about him anymore.<br>
<br>
Of course I run a couple Sense/Alter, who doesn&#8217;t in a BHBM deck, it&#8217;s obvious.  Plus its kind of required to take out Honor of the Jedi and Goo Nee Tay, which will hurt you early game before you &#8221;outgrow&#8221; them.  Against Honor i also have No Escape, although i prefer not to start with it but instead deploy it to retrieve one of those Lost Interrupts.<br>
<br>
ok, somebody said i should put in some matchups, so here:<br>
RTP, Profit, RST, QMC - Go to the AC, the Bunker, or wherever they run, and hit them hard again and again.  These decks you really need to hit early and often to make sure they don&#8217;t get off the ground.  Against Profit, you&#8217;ll probably want to start Mara and Fett, but immediately, first turn, back them up with an Imperial or you&#8217;ll be losing some nasty battles when fett gets bounced by master luke or you find your ability is 0 from R3 Leia. and don&#146;t forget that they&#146;ll be deploying Master Luke for fat nasty 0 force every stinking turn so you need to get him out of play ASAP.  if Profit is really strong in your area, think about adding a Tat docking bay if they don&#146;t give you one (Mos Espa seems best to me). against RST, remember the Bunker&#8217;s not a battleground so if they concentrate there, hit them with SearchnDestroy.  against QMC...nobody plays this in my region, so you probably know better how to beat it than i do.<br>
<br>
WYS - Tough matchup, i actually haven&#8217;t played against a WYS deck with this yet (nobody seems willing to build them anymore for some reason) but i can tell its going to be bloody.  hit them hard on the ground again and again, try to keep their objective on the 0 side or your activation gets killed.  unless you win some early battles, your best bet is to Force Lightning/Young Fool Luke ASAP to remove their number 1 main.<br>
<br>
EBO/HB - These decks usually rely on one battleground site to keep Menace Fades and Battle Plan hurting you.  so take it away from them.  Hold all your ships until you need them, then hit them hard at one system when they decide to spread thin.  Also try to get them when they don&#8217;t have any Force for XWing Cannons, or at a system without XWings...those things are nasty.  against HB, draw early so you don&#8217;t get choked by their flip side, and make absolutely sure you have sense and the Barrier canceler when you start probing.  If hidden base is strong in your area, you might think about Security Precautions.<br>
<br>
anyway, no matter how you play it, Bring Him Before Me is always a fun deck to play, and I think with this deck, you can definitely say, &#8221;It&#8217;s already been broughten!&#8221;<br>
<br>
so possible card additions/changes:<br>
-if big space decks aren&#146;t common in your area, definitely drop thrawn and maybe even chimaera for Dr. E combo and Bad Feeling Have I.  in fact, you might wanna do that even if space decks are around, those two cards rock in BHBM.<br>
-original Mob Points for the mob points combo if you like big activation and aren&#146;t worried about inserts or defense value.<br>
-Mos Espa docking bay instead of Coruscant DB, this will help against WYS by eliminating your non-battleground sites and also give you a db against Profit if they don&#146;t.<br>
-EPP Mauls instead of YA, although YA rocks against LSC if you manage to get him in a battle.<br>
