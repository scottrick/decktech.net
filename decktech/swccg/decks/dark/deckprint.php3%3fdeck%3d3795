<br>
<br>
in response to reviews:<br>
a lot of people say i don't activate much- i'll change that, allhough if i start w/plaza and iao, i can pull system and sector, by turn 3 i'm activating 8+ force.<br>
thanks for all the constructive help everyone has given me.<br>
<br>
the start: (6 cards)- objective, then use it to pull secret plans and all wrapped up. use a twilek to get what you need to counter their deck.<br>
use the downtown plaza, a good draining location, plus good text (may use 1 force to retrieve a cc site)<br>
what to do: set up big drains with dark deal, presence of the force, sabers and the like. the great thing is you don't need to flip to win!<br>
use the 9 ships to hold the system and sector (those os guys are eack like power 6-7 at bespin!)<br>
get mosep in a walker in the middle of your locations. always pull system first turn, second pull occupation, 3rd sector, last dark deal.<br>
2x hutt smooch cause uc spies would hurt this. no sac protection because its not real big here an most stuff is immune.<br>
fun stuff to do: against a 1-turn destiny adding light deck, put vader/tarkin/kast/crush the rebellion out. cancel first destiny w/ tarkin, second w/ kast, and ohh wait they only draw 2 on cc with crush out.<br>
<br>
vs specific stuff:<br>
profit- well, you get out all wrapped up and secret plans free, then i would say use twilek for battle order, as most profit decks generate low force and are light in space.<br>
<br>
mwyhl-this is the hardest to beat. start normal, use twilek to start broken concentration.  set up fast, get some occupation going. if they pull off test 1, no big deal, just put presences on locations and still drain for 2 or 3 all around.<br>
put out chybc so they have to come to you.  against a test 5 deck, they will lose all their cards to mosep before they finish all the tests.<br>
<br>
hidden base-start sec precautions if you think normal hb, but chybc if it looks like some screwy asteroid deck. dont go away from bespin till they flip.  you should be able to outdrain a hb deck.<br>
<br>
operatives-start battle order. this deck can outdrain ops. heck, if you want to you can go there and beat them down on their home planet!<br>
<br>
<br>
if u have any questions, fell free to ask, i can explain every cards use in this deck.<br>
