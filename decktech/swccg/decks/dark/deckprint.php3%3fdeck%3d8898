We're in attack Position now</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is a Ralltiir Operations deck that will set up big drains in space and hurt them on the ground.  Well heres some tech for you!<br>
<br>
Admiral Chinraneau:  Hes great he adds to force drains at systems where u have a star destroyer!!<br>
Sullust and Kashyyyk with a SD at both drain for 6 unless they come to you.. and with Something Special Planned for them its +2 to move their ships to the systems with a SD!!<br>
<br>
We're in attack postion now:  Gives Star Destroys their much needed immunity to attrition and makes pilots deploy cheaper to ships.<br>
<br>
I know what your thinking Romans would prolly screw this deck.	Well yes it would but i play tramples with and average destiny of 3 so i could prolly get him and be able to react.<br>
<br>
What to do against popular decks<br>
<br>
EBO:  Easy set up Search and destroy with Ice Plains or Wampa Cave exteneding the shields and try drain in space and on ground.<br>
<br>
Profit:  Set up you planet sites for a constant drain of 1 at each site.. try to flip fast (they prolly wont come to you) get your space up and try to occupy some tatooine sites to stop some of their drains.<br>
<br>
Throne Room:  This could be a hard game.  Try to keep your space sites heavily occupied with your stuff so you wont lose so much if they attack.. try to get bad feeling have i out fast to make their mains cost alot.<br>
<br>
There is good in him:  dont go to his site cause then luke will be captured and that will kinda hurt you... try to flip with a walker at every site or have a lone guy with Tempest Scout 6 in your hand.. drain in space drain on ground.<br>
<br>
Also this deck is good against Goo Nee Tay cause most of my stuff execpt like Vader, Tarkin and Chinerau are under ability 3.<br>
<br>
Well try it out its a fun deck to play with high destiny.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
