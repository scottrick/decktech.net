speed deal is all about setting up fast with troopers on the ground to drain out the opponent. first turn deploy the docking bay, get 2 interior sites from reserve using i`m sorry. for the starting effects imperial arrest order-not the combo cause you don`t get the forfeit+2 on the combo, secret plans to make them pay to retrieve. <br>
<br>
on the ground it`s power +4 for dark deal, power plus how many starships you`ve got at bespin cloud city and trooper assault makes your troopers power +2. stunning leader is very effective because it excludes characters, if there left with someone like chewie or an ability 2 charcter there is only one thing BATTLE DAMAGE.<br>
<br>
cloud city occupation makes them lose force for every site you occupy combined with search and destroy if they play all space is loads of direct damage. there`s 2 twi`leks to get out the city effect, there`s 2 of them, it lets you deploy executor for free. tactical supports are in there to get out the troopers faster. a big card in the deck i`d just as soon kiss a wookie, it delays there charcters from beating you down.here are a few matchups.<br>
<br>
-vs- echo base opperations or hidden base<br>
get out your sites as you would, get the executor for free, setup up hopefully by turn 2. if they are playing all space you don`t have to worry about a beat down. drain them out super fast, direct damage will just kill them off. if you fear a beatdown be a bit more careful, delay them or use cards like stunning leader.<br>
<br>
-vs- podprofit<br>
start by getting your sites out as you would, secret plans slows them right down, try and drain them before they can do much, podracer is in there for the defensive shield to cut the damage right down and makes i did it suspended. if they go down to cloud city to delay them as much as possible, use cards like stunning leader to exclude their mains from battle.<br>
<br>
-vs- there is good in him<br>
get out all your sites like usual, you get the head start cause your dark side, if they stay on endor which is a bad move drain them out really quick and direct damage will kill them off. you`ve got executor for free in space, if you forfeit a tie you can put it back in your hand cause of the city effect. drain them and win. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
