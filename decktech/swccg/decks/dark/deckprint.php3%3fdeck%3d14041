Inspired by Matt Sokal&#146;s Beast that got him to day 3, everyone thought that this deck was dead when sac &quot;died&quot;, however the sense combo card makes setting up the beast evr so easy.<br>
 The plan is simple, do the usual BHBM thing early on, draw for the beast combo, when they drop a character, barrier it and throw something in front of it and set up the beast.<br>
If you&#146;re playing against mains, just roc/maih obi or someone on the super falcon(the combo works in space) and watch &#146;em lose 4 force a turn...if they try to kill their own dude by on the egdging him or pathing him, just sense it and lose the 2 force, no matter what, keep the combo on the table.<br>
the sense combo card lets you get the beats going super fast and protects it once you&#146;ve got it going.<br>
<br>
The character selection is decent enough to hold 2 battle grounds considering they&#146;ll be playing without luke(captured) and one of theitr other mains (roc&#146;d).<br>
The 6 ships assures you can get in front of their drain of 3 at kessel if you&#146;re playing against dagobah or wys.<br>
 <br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
HB mains...absolutely wrecks HB mains, they&#146;ll put stuff down somewhat early, when they do just cpture luke and roc ben...game set and match, sense their key interupts and just lose the 2 force.<br>
should win by 20-30 everytime.  Mad tech when playing against this:<br>
If you roc ben, and they have another dude with ben, get vader and a bunch of other high power characters in front of ben, cirlce ben,(now you can battle) and beat up on the scrub to end the game:)<br>
<br>
Dagobah:...Roc/Maih the falcon, sense their edges...alter OTE(importanat!)<br>
Shouln&#146;t be that hard to win, set up search and destroy early.<br>
<br>
Any other kind of mains deck:...Roc their ben or super falcon(whichever is more importnt to their deck), capture luke and out battle the rest of their guys.<br>
<br>
EBO:...toughest matchup, use you 6 ships to wreak havoc, your ships have the potential to be wrecking crews since if you set it up right, you can be drawing 4-5 destinies in space battles(IE xizor on his ship, m jabba as a passanger, thrwn on a SD, bossk in bus) this may sound hard to set up but it ain&#146;t, since you got 5 recoil in fears.<br>
Roc won&#146;t be tthat important in this game but you may be able to give them some force loss for it.  Shoudl be able to pull this one out.<br>
<br>
Xwing swarm....set up search and destroy, draw for your fleet, set up a big space battle where you have multiple destines, sense their organized attack and watch them lose like 5 xwings per battle.<br>
easy win<br>
<br>
speedrers or chandra fan swarm...hardest matchup...very hard to win.  Try to out battle them but is hard...however, you have one advantage, NO ONE PLAYS THIS!<br>
<br>
WYS:<br>
wrecks it liek a poor kitten, you get mad drains on teh ground and they can&#146;t drain at kessel cuz you roc&#146;d em...win by 35 every time.<br>
<br>
Everything it else it handles with ease...any questions dmail me...this thing ROCKS! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
