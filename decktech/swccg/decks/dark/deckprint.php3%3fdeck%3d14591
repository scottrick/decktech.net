Runs Walkers and lots o&#8217; pilots so I can go to DB&#8217;s and start Battles without fear of Fallen Portal.  I plan on bringing this to a Tourney on Saturday.  I built it to stand up to WYS better than what I had been playing.  Any suggestions would be helpful.<br>
<br>
Match-ups:<br>
<br>
WYS-Take over your 2 DB&#8217;s (Hoth and Yavin) then use your Walkers Tramples, and IC&#8217;s to make short work of their puny guys.  Still a very tough match-up but if you play smart you should win.<br>
<br>
AITC-See above, Squish all non-unique Aliens, and just clean up the mess. Imperial Decree will help here, since they can&#8217;t jsut out drain you.<br>
<br>
TR Mains-a good match up, you don&#8217;t need their force, and you have lots o&#8217; spies, drop a spy and a walker on Crix and give him the beating of his life.  Your Imperail Command and squish cards should be able to handle their EPP&#8217;s.<br>
<br>
TIGIH-leave Luke alone till you get Vader, his drains will be squat without bonuses, you should never lose a battle, just don&#8217;t be stupid. Fortify your guys<br>
<br>
Anything Else- Play your game.  Take over your DB&#8217;s and then Battle on your own Terms.  Anyone who played my BHBM (at the MN grand Slam and a few Tourneys after that) knows what this can do, just don&#8217;t play stupid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay for notable ommisions:<br>
Xixor, doors always seem to fall on his head, and there are better pilots<br>
Mara, Don&#8217;t really need her, have a lot of spies, and all of them Drain plus 1, most of my battles should be walkers with pilots, and that is not where she is best utilized.   Plus like xixor doors alwyas seem to be falling on her.<br>
Empy and Friends, again not really a neccesity, there are better characters for this deck.  Would liek to add them, but not at the expence of other cards..<br>
<br>
Would LIke to adds,<br>
Reactor Terminal (just because I like it, last thing on this list though)<br>
Imperial Command (at least 1 more)<br>
SA Protection (LS doesn&#8217;t really play it around here, but a good Heavuy SA deck could cause some problems)<br>
Grabbers (really would go with above)<br>
Nevar Yalnal, want at least 2 maybe 3, just need to find space<br>
<br>
Any specific Questions D-mail me, otherwise be fair.<br>
