<b/> Update: Screwy Review/Screwy Reviewer </b><br>
<br>
<i/> WTF!! 5 tie bombers... Come on, give me a break. this is pathetic. Thism looks like a screwed up 'Character elimination' deck with ties in it. And it's #1 on DT right now, no offense to the authior at all though. </i><br>
<br>
Umm, dude, did you read the strategy at all? I don't think so. What's the point of telling you people what the deck is supposed to do when all you people do is to look at the deck and see the individual cards and not how they work as a whole? And it's TEN tie bombers...did you fail your math or something?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Before you go WTF!! and give this deck two stars, take a good look at it. It's not your run of the mill SCYFA beatdown deck; neither is it your average Bomber deck. Instead, it's a retrieval engine built after the likes of Brangus Glee Superstar and When Weapons Are Outlawed.<br>
<br>
I really liked the Brangus + POSOA combination, so when 3A came out my friends and I were talking about building it with SYCFA (yes, we did realise it's potential way before many people, judging from the number of reviews that said "Original" on Bastian's deck). The problem, however, was its insane vulnerability to grabbers. If the POSOA got grabbed, you were in deep crap. There simply wasn't enough retrieval to keep the deck running smoothly. So we ditched the deck and played Rops and Eops instead.<br>
<br>
Well, when I saw Bastian's deck something immediately caught my eye. The use of Wakeelmui and the Tie Squadrons. At that instant I had this sudden flash of inspiration: Why not chuck the Brangus thing all together and just couple it with Mike Mikealian's When Weapons Are Outlawed?<br>
<br>
Several advantages:<br>
1) Non suspectability to grabbers. The only thing that can be grabbed is All Power to Weapons, and it's not crucial.<br>
2) More retrieval for less cards.<br>
3) Sustainability. If Brangus gets killed by RTP and gets placed OOP you just lost a lot of potential retrieval.<br>
4) Destiny. Planetary Subjugation is a really wicked card. I'm surprised how few people have picked up on it's power, seeing how open the current scene is. You have the power to decide between low and high destinies; what else can be better? SAC works, and you draw high for battles.<br>
<br>
With that in mind I set out to create a mix of Docking Bays, Ground Pound, and high destiny bombers.<br>
<br>
You start off with SYCFA, Prepared Defenses, Mob Points, Planetary Subjugation, and You Cannot Hide Forever. Pull out Wakeelmui first turn. Pull out DS: DB Control Room and put out docking bays when you have enough characters to hold them.<br>
Get out SFS by 3rd turn usually, and dump it down. Proceed.<br>
<br>
The idea behind this deck is to keep as many bombers in the deck whenever possible for insane destiny. When you need to retrieve, just drop a couple of bombers along with a suicide squad to knock off the opponent's forces. Forfeit the bombers and protect your low-forfeit people. Face it, in this age of high destiny there's no way bounty hunters survive unless backed up by forfeit fodder.<br>
<br>
The thing about the Brangus deck was its lack of drain potential and inability to satisfy HotJedi, so I took a cue from HDADTJ and set up MPoints/DB insanity. Now you have drain potential, places to go, and battlegrounds for all round fun. Shuttling is also nice to use for times when you need to concentrate your forces at a place.<br>
<br>
Explainations of single cards:<br>
<br>
Janus Greejatus: This guy is a machine. If you know how to track single cards, you won't ever lack high destiny again. Recycle bombers or destiny 6 cancellers, the choice is yours. A4 as well, so in a pinch dump him along with some bombers to defend a docking bay.<br>
<br>
Emp: Not much to say, you all know the trick of putting him at DS: DB to hold the docking bay by himself. Can't be knocked off except for a poke.<br>
<br>
Enhanced Bounty Hunters: They got guns, and they add destiny. Perfect for slamming a beatdown. Also they work charms against ELOMS and Chandra Fans. With the resurgence of non-unique aliens there's something to be said for direct removal.<br>
Dr Evazan and Dengar can take out a lot of stuff, trust me.<br>
<br>
Prophetess: Another cue taken from Bastian. Use her to clean out the Death Star by predicting that you'll lose, then drawing destiny and killing her off.<br>
<br>
Death Star Assault Squadron: Used for Hit and Run missions where you simply have to have power. Can be pulled out with SYCFA.<br>
<br>
Boring/Shut Him Up: Took 2 Alters out for these. They work charms against Wise Advice.<br>
<br>
S&D/BOrder/CHYBC: The trio that works against most decks. They're very flexible, and 2 of them can be pulled out with Hide 4ever. Hide 4ever protects against numbers, which I see as a threat to most DS decks even today. Don't ditch it if you suspect a rat...<br>
<br>
R2Q2: Put him in there instead of Dark Path. Instead of burning 2 cards, you track with R2Q2.<br>
<br>
Imperial Supply, Operational as Planned: These serve double purpose as Grimtaash protection and FA/DTF protection. When you have 2 bombers in hand and he Grims you, play one of these. You'll still have 1 bomber in hand and the other in the Lost Pile or Used Pile. When you see FA and you have Ghhhk in hand, play one of these to get an instant Force boost. Main Course doesn't work that well, and Operational as Planned helps you put back cards.<br>
<br>
OE: Your S/A protection, along with the grabber.<br>
<br>
Overload: If you get this in your starting hand against TiGiH, play it for the hell of it. You might get lucky...Luke gets blown up while waiting for his father. lol :) Otherwise, track a 0 and blow up EPPs or the occasional XWing Laser Cannon.<br>
<br>
The rest should be pretty easy to understand. If you don't know what a card does, get Deckmaker up and check! <b/> Don't make a fool out of yourself in the review section. </b><br>
<br>
This deck is unstable, but it works quite nicely. Try it out if you can before you review it.<br>
<br>
Mad props to Bastian for tech, mad props to Mike for Outlawed. They're both good decks in their own right, but this deck plays to my style.<br>
