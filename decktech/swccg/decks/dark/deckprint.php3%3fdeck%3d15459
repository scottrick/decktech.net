Some Responses to Reviews<br>
1) Makurth DOES suck. this is the only dedk in which he makes sense though. Put him down at luke&#8217;s site and with another char/s enough to draw BD and use wounded wookie and luke loses his immunity. Say bye bye to Luke<br>
<br>
2) I don&#8217;t wanna start PotF cuz then Xizor can be quickly killed because Guri is not by his side.<br>
<br>
3) When i say find out what is in your force pile in the early game I mean use IAO and search for a DB and figure out what is in your force pile =-)<br>
<br>
4) I&#8217;ve found that All Wrapped Up works better for me and against the peopoe I play against<br>
<br>
5) this deck is not a capture deck. I have the security tower in the deck just incase i decide to bring a captive in. Not a major thing, I mainly use the bountys so i can chase after luke with my bounty hunters during my control phase.<br>

1st Turn -  Deploy Coruscant DB and check to see if  you ahve a find out what cards that could be useful in the early game are in your force pile (i.e. Guri, Sites) and move Xizor to the DB and draw your force pile if there were any good cards there. <br>
<br>
2nd Turn - Deploy CC: DB and if you have a guri in hand deploy her to there and transit Xizor over, if not don&#8217;t move Xizor and wait for Guri to pop up. <br>
<br>
Always try to find out what is in your force pile so you can draw when the time is right. You should get the downtown plaza and incinerator out by 6th turn. Get a hold on these 2 sites and usually each turn you can retrieve a droid and a site (track these so they can be lost at a later date or drawn to be played). Only deploy your starships if the LS has left a lonely starfighter all alone at a system.<br>
<br>
Card Explainations<br>
<br>
All Wrapped Up - When Luke come down to a BG site, you should be able to take care of him. Make sure a Bounty Hunter survuves and capture him and protect that bounty hunter at all costs. When Luke is not on table this deck has an easy ride.<br>
<br>
1 extra Xizor - I don&#8217;t usually even play the 2nd Xizor, no one ever gets through the first one. This one is just here in case something really goes wrong.<br>
<br>
All the Droids -  A nice constant force retrieval with the incinerator<br>
<br>
Makurth -  A non-unique black sun agent that can easily take down luke with a lil help and a wounded wookie<br>
<br>
Sniper & Dark Strike -  Naturally I won&#8217;t be able to hit Luke but it is a nice way of getting rid of those undercover spys<br>
<br>
Bounty - Deploy one on Luke and he has no where to run from your bounty hunters!<br>
<br>
If you think your gonna be playing sac start TINT/OE instead of All wrapped Up   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
