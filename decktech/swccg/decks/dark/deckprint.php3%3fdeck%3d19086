<br>
WATCH YOUR STEP:<br>
<br>
WYS can be beat, here is how, start with what the objective and podracing gives you, and start Expand The Empire on the podrace arena.  Quickly flip 1st turn, and drop Palpy to the Cantina, join him with Mara and have them deal with Karrde and the rest of his smugglers.  Have Maul deal with the rest of his smugglers and have Vader duel Luke.  In space use Thrawn in Chimaera and the Executor to deal with Dash in Outrider and have Zuckess control Tatooine to control the occupation, play your game, and don&#146;t make many mistakes and you can beat WYS.<br>
<br>
PODPROFIT<br>
<br>
The funnest match i think, start with what the objective gives you, drop Mara and Xizor to the Chamber and begin the race, start with CHYBC to protect oyou should you lose the race, deploy Watto to the yard for the 1st turn flip and get Paply to the Audience Chamber, and begin to fry any one that comes to free Han, duel Luke and Obi Wan with Vader and duel Qui Gon with Maul.  I Have You Now is great in this since it adds up to 2 battle destiny.  If they try top celebrate, use Zuckess and Thrawn in their ships to put an end to that.<br>
<br>
LS SENATE<br>
<br>
Easy win, start with the objective and the podracing and Watto&#146;s Box, drop Watto to the yard and flip 1st turn, deploy Palpy to the Senate and Maul and Vader to Coruscant to deal with the Jedi.  Have Palpy fry all the Senators since Force Lightning isn&#146;t effected by the Senate&#146;s text.  Then let your direct damage do the rest.<br>
<br>
HIDDEN BASE<br>
<br>
Easy win, start with Podracing and Security Precautions, get Maul into space and start probing remembering to cloak every turn, flip early and this game is yours, just watch out for the X-Wing swarm<br>
<br>
those are all the deck&#146;s I have played, I am currently 11-1, losing only to WYS, but i have beaten it 3 times </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
