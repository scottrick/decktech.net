Roc combo, its 3 card slots.  If you dont like it take it out.  BUT  i think it&#146;s still worth it.  Noone will play @#$% liek as good as gone anymore and late game after they have played 3 shields, the roc combo could win you a game.  If you dont like it take it out and add in another ship and some more high destiny.<br>
<br>
R3 enviroment.  hayes, new obj gets assed buy this.  You quite simply drop down vader and maul on their jedis and kill him.  Track two senators, swing and quiggy is dead, track with janus so you never lose a dule by more than 5 and drain else where with janus and palp.  Plus the kashyyyk drain all game screws them too.  Of course if you were to actually play this deck after R3 there are some R3 cards that would help out(new fett and epp vader hit squads own), but all &#148;No r3 decks&#148; have the same quality(IE battle plan shield in your wys ect...).<br>
<br>
Had some problems with numbering my catagories, for example there are not 9 interupts in the deck, but the deck has 60 cards so its fine.<br>
<br>

It’s solid.  It battles well, tracks great, and you stuff never leaves the table because of the destiny -3 poli effect.  The senators are way over powered and maul/vader/palp/mara is all you need.<br>
<br>
Card explinations<br>
<br>
walkers-they are immune compltely because of edkerball and your poili effect and cant be barriered.  they are money vs. WYS.<br>
<br>
Roc Combo- yeah they play hate for it but every so often it hits people up.<br>
<br>
Character selection<br>
guys are great and all you need. Palp janus holds a site.  EPP vader and p=59 and mara are great for hit squads.  Maul holds a site and is near invincible with a walker.<br>
<br>
Kashyyyk.  <br>
Vs pile mains or dagobah you can put fett and zuckuss up there and drain.  satisfy battle plan and do good stuff.<br>
<br>
senators and 2 poli effects.<br>
All the senators are high destiny and 2 poli effects mean you can track 2 senators a turn.  Money.  example.  They drain you and battle you during your turn.  You drop edkerball to cancel the drain and lott dodd to make their destiny -3.  At teh end of there turn use 2 force to put ’em back.  Next turn drop vadera nd hack and draw high destiny with the tracked senators.  Again , money.<br>
<br>
Matchups-<br>
<br>
wys-can be hard if you get chocked early but just take over all his land stuff and play slow.  Reinfoce your sites and pay to drain.  cancel kessel drain.  Get tikes out asap. start auto grabber and crush.<br>
<br>
Pile force choke mains.  start crush and tint/oppresive.  Set up slow.  Set up kashyyyk.  Dont get beat down.  Try to set up the roc combo.  <br>
<br>
QMC.  Take over a site with palp and janus and maul and mara.  set up the combo late game after you have grabbed 3 paths.  Start auto grabber and crush<br>
<br>
LS senate.<br>
start phantom menace and crush.  Use falke’s tech with yeb yeb and that namodian guy to get rid of there destiny.  Control the senate and beat them down where ever they are.  Easy game.<br>
<br>
Space.  Hard but monnok is a good card.  How many pure ls space decks have you seen lately?<br>
<br>
Thats about.  No r3 but yet competitive post R3.  Good deck.  Is solid.  Wont lose many games and has no major weaknesses.  Hope ya like it.--H2O  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
