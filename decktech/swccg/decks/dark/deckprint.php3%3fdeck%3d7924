<br>
Dagobah-lost a game to Dagobah drain, don't intend to lose again; CHYBC would be more versatile, but the opponent can get around it easier than you think<br>
<br>
Coruscant-for those that haven't done this yet, converting an HB player's Coruscant will drop the drain from 3 to 1, and it also reduces the # of battleground systems to make the flip take longer<br>
<br>
Disruptor Pistols-with 31 cards out of 54 in your initial reserve deck at 4-destiny or higher, taking out EPP Han with the first battle action is not very hard (and WELL worth it); also good for Sniper and...<br>
<br>
Pinned Down-stops all sorts of Arcona and OtE tech, more secure method than using Senses to stop the reacts<br>
<br>
A*3-how many ability cards are usually on table in a mains n' toys deck?  Also good for damage in a late-game drain race when not much deployment is going on<br>
<br>
<br>
How I play it:<br>
<br>
First of all, don't dismiss the possibility of having an automatic flip of the objective.  Despite all the counters to them, all-droid decks still appear at tournaments sometimes for the ability of using AFA, #'s, and even D*Plans all in the same deck.<br>
<br>
If you don't luck into the early flip, just pull the AC with CCT's 0-side, get Pote, and add a couple Skrillings to protect him.  If he dies, there is a back up Pote.  If the LS player uses all or primarily space, establish some decent drains on Tatooine and use Den of Thieves to diminish his.  Hopefully the LS player will be using alot of ground, so you can pummel him.	S&amp;V retrieval, for those of you have never really used it and don't know, can make 13 Skrillings seem like 20+, so much that you can afford to go wherever the opponent goes and never run out of Skrillings, even without Elis Helrot.  They deploy for 1 and have power 4, and the Disruptor Pistols make them even more dangerous.  The Surface Defense floating through the deck can make taking out any EPP except for Obi a real possibility.<br>
<br>
The 3,720 to 1, while many people prepare for them, can still cause damage against unprepared opponents.  The deck CAN win without them, so I don't devote alot of slots to grabbing DFTD or using stuff like It's Worse.  If they're playing Ultimatum, you have a good shot of knocking them off their 3 battlegrounds, or getting in an insert on the first turn with a total of 11, before they have their defenses ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
Against particular decks:<br>
<br>
HB- enough ships to probe, SecPrec makes Fett in S1 a good prober with his immunity to attrition in addition to the battle damage immunity where there's a probe; the deck doesn't rely on drains, the #'s will do damage, the Abyssin Ornament retrieval will help keep it close, and No Bargain hinders EPP hit squads that would like to come after Pote<br>
<br>
M&amp;T (any flavor)- two ground battlers, it'll be a fun game; the S&amp;V retrieval will give you a small advantage over the course of the game, and those Disruptor Pistols are a force to be reckoned with; 4-LOM can be dropped as a suicide anti-main character, and if you keep him on the table it only reduces your #'s total to 10<br>
<br>
EBO- if you think people will actually be playing this after D*2 comes out, throw in Resistance, otherwise just wait for it to die and try Skrillings again then; with their drains limited, EBO is a mediocre mains deck, see my article for a more detailed argument about that<br>
<br>
RTP- yeah, right...the 7-side does almost nothing of interest to a Skrilling deck<br>
<br>
MBO- well, unless you play against the square root of a negative opponent (an 'imaginary friend' for you non-math folks) you probably won't be seeing this; if you do, let them give you the 8 force loss and move on knowing they spent a good portion of their deck on that little 8 force you had to lose, when they just lost the same amount to an insert and you recovered that amount with Abyssin Ornament<br>
