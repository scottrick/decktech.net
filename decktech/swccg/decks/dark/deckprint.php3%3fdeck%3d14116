1. This is an old deck so it cant find its way to the top ten<br>
2. Ive already deleted some reviews so you cant help my rating but you can hurt it<br>
3. Its just for fun<br>
<br>
Are you tired off Hunt Down and Bring Him Before Me, sick of Court and Scum, bored to death with Interceptors and Black Sun, and find ISB and Dark Sneate strangely unfullfilling, open up your box of unused cards and throw this deck together.  You probaly wont win but youll sure as hell have fun losing.<br>
<br>
As Im sure youve already noticed, this deck is overflowing with gooey tech.  Id like to take this oprotunity to enlighten those of you who have yet to comprehend the extent of my genius.<br>
<br>
You start the planet Hoth and play Comabt Readiness to get the Defensive Perimeter.<br>
<br>
Hopefully in your openning hand you drew a pair of Banthas.  Go ahead an toss those bad boys down to the Defensive Perimeter. Remember Banthas each have an ability of 1/2, so two equals presence. Draw the rest.  Your opponent with think that youve gone out of yor frickin gourd so he wont deploy anything first turn because hes afraid that you might snap at his fingers.  I should add that you should be taunting your opponent at this juncture.  ”Whats wrong? Are you afraid of two little Banthas?” and ”Come and get some Bantha lovin, you little @#$%” work for me but feel free to take your own artistic liberties.  <br>
<br>
Your second turn should consist of you getting an ice storm if you dont already have one.  Twi’lek for it or draw for one.  Dont forget your drain of two (No one likes being drained by Banthas.)  If you get an ice storm, continue to taunt your opponent.  If you dont have one then you should shut the hell up.<br>
<br>
Now you wait for him to bring down a beatdown squad on your poor shaggy Banthas as the freeze there asses off on hoth.  If you have a Ghhhk, play it.  If you dont, well thats what you get for playing a Bantha deck.  Just take the damage and look dejected. <br>
<br>
Now its your turn, ice storm his characters and deploy more banthas.  Now you want to get out the Sunsdown (or Nightfall, I cant remember which one is the darksides)/Frostbite direct damage combo.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the game consists of you preventing him from finding his missing characters and you screwing with your opponents drains.  I packed all kinds of crap to accomplish these tasks.<br>
<br>
Best case senerio, your opponent puts down more characters and you play youre second ice storm but we both know this aint gonna happen.  without your ice storms you are going to have to rely on your creatures to kill off his characters.  The womp rats can deploy to Hoth if you need them and Bubo can go anywhere else.  Pump up your creatures with Banthas and Yakkle Gakkle.  This combo will result in Ubercreatures that can eat mains with the greatest of ease. <br>
<br>
Your average destiny is just under 5 so counter assaults can be big against wienies.<br>
<br>
For space, stick IG-88 at Kessel, Tallon Roll your opponents ships, and laugh like a madman. <br>
<br>
Well that covers almost everything. Ive included some strategies for some popular decks.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base - You only get one shot at probing so make it count. (Usually its Kessel or Alderaan) Drop your Sythe Squadron TIE, probe, and play come with me to eject the pilot.  Fun had by all.<br>
<br>
WYS - Smugglers are crunchy and easy to eat.  Patrol craft taste like @#$% so it will be hard going.  Tallon Roll his fleet away.<br>
<br>
Mains - Ubercreatures and Ghhhk<br>
<br>
Agents In The Court - As it is widely known, non-unique aliens are cream-filled <br>
<br>
Speeders - Fake a heart attack  <br>
<br>
EBO - You have enough Banthas to cancel Echo Base Operations pfffffffhhhhhhhhh........<br>
<br>
Heres some individual card tech -<br>
<br>
Lateral Damage - Remember the good ole days when Lateral Damage/Tallon roll ruled the earth. I do.<br>
<br>
Dark Manuevers - Trackable six for your Rats and beefs up your Tallon Rolls<br>
<br>
Counter Assault- I like to Lateral damage a lone ship and leave it alone to force drain. Then I play Counter Assault and laugh my @#$% off.<br>
<br>
Operational As Planned - for that extra force for your Ghhhk or Counter Assault.<br>
<br>
Come With Me - Prevents the HB Beatdown<br>
<br>
Mynocks - Oh this is soooo tech.  Mynocks wont attach to your fighters because when they try, it reduces your power to zero so they let go.  So they will attach to your opponents ships making them sitting ducks for Tallon Rolls.  They can also be used to take out power one scrubs on the ground.<br>
<br>
U-3PO - This is crazy tech too.  As we all know, he can be used to stop drains.  Now heres the real tech.  If you stick him at the Defensive Perimeter and break his cover (his gametext makes him a lightside character,) you can ice storm him to make your opponet lose to Frostbite. BooHahahahahahahahaha.<br>
<br>
Like I said before this deck is strictly for @#$%s and giggles so dont both telling me whats wrong with it or what I need to change.  I wouldnt even take this to a local tournament in Louisiana (they suck in Loiusiana.)  It just submitted it because its something different from the every day decks that you see and Im sure it will stick out among all the kick-ass DPC decks.  <br>
<br>
Well, thats it. Thanks for reading.       <br>
