<br>
Whoops, my bad. I have one too many extra docking bays. Add in a Pointman. I should have a total of 3 DS Docking Bays.<br>
<br>
Tallon: I do play anti SAC, its called There is No Try. Do or Do Not is a light side card you refer to. Against most decks I start There is No Try. Unless it happens to be HB, EBO, or Chadra Fans.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
This deck is the total package. Brangus retrieval and Set Your Course Scum are perfect complements- I cant believe I havent seen it before. Please refer to Brangus Glee Superstar if you are not familiar with the Brangus engine.<br>
<br>
The key to the deck is redundancy- stop the Brangus retrieval through either elimination of Brangus or grabbing PASOA, you still got Scum working for you or vice versa. The trap lies in that if they try to kill Brangus at the DS: Docking Bay, you can retrieve 3 a turn through suicide squads. If they dont come for Brangus, you get to retrieve a card into your hand per turn. Either way, you are ahead in the game.<br>
<br>
If they grab your PASOA, that means that all your other recycling interrupts get through (retrieved through scum). Then using Scum and First Strike, you can still retrieve your docking bays. Unlike most Brangus decks, the retrieval engine has redundancy and is not fragile.<br>
<br>
Brangus makes this such a combo deck. If they got the EPP hit squad, during a control phase, disarm and operate with Evasan (sometimes you can lay the smackdown with the Elis- this card is a gamebreaker if it goes through). Use Brangus, retrieve the disarm, take out another EPP. Then beatdown whoever is left.<br>
<br>
Superfalcon with EPP Leia, Han, and a scrub giving your problems? Set up your destinies, set for stun Leia during opponents turn, Brangus your set for stun back, stun Han during your turn and beat on the scrub.<br>
<br>
Suicide ghhhk attacks- attack with a scrub, retrieve 3, opponent loses one. You ghhhk, you retrieve your ghhhk back into hand with Brangus. Repeat next turn. Its too damn good. I grab your ghhhk? What are you going to grab, the ghhhk, the PSAOS, the infinite Set for Stuns, None Shall Pass, Projective Telepathy, what?<br>
<br>
Remember, the Death Star is an auto ghhhk. If they go after Brangus at the DS, just dont draw destiny, let Brangus die and retrieve 3 a turn for the rest of the game.<br>
<br>
Projective Telepathy lets you do hit and run retrieval. Battle, retrieve 3, lose 1, cancel your battle, run away. Stops Anger Fears, Order to Engage, and other uses too. Infinite ghhhks also lets you bypass Order to Engage if needed.<br>
<br>
You get the idea.<br>
<br>
Activation like all SYC Scum decks is big and reliable. Most cases start, Power of the Hutt, No Bargain, and a hate card depending on circumstance. Grab your War Room, and Hutt Influence if you think you will need it, and check for your JP. I usually dont draw until I get a JP or an AC into my force pile, but its up to you and the game. Build up the Audience Chamber, slowly grabbing aliens and setting up Scum. Brangus will eventually set up itself, dont force it by drawing too many or other foolishness. Securing AC is the key.<br>
<br>
Specific matchups:<br>
<br>
Hidden Base: Start You Cannot Hide Forever, once you verify no Odds, grab Security Precautions or Search and Destroy. Power of the Hutt kills Projection of a Skywalker and Rebel Fleet. S&D is a HB killah. Just laugh when they stick Luke at a forest. Either infinite suicide attacks or Elis your entire crew at the AC and draw your 4 destinies and dont forget to retrieve 3. =) Take care of Squadron Assignments with your Set for Stuns and Xwings with Monnoks. Remember, if you play it correctly, you should be able to Set for Stun and Monnok multiple times in a game.<br>
<br>
Throne Room: Multiple Disarmeds, Snipers, and retrieval should do them in. Play carefully, If you can secure the AC, you should win. They will try to drain at the JP but your recurring controls should stop that. If they move into the AC, you know what to do with your battle cards.<br>
<br>
Speeders: Simple, dont go outside. Once they establish a drain (usually at JP), use your suicide attacks to retrieve. If Speeders is prevalent in your area, add in a Lower Passage for another 2 drain (Gallid) and take out a Control or Sniper.<br>
<br>
Profit: 2 starting aliens certainly help your cause. Start Secret Plans. Never None Shall Pass the first character. Force choke them by replacing their sites. Get Scum going, Ephant Mon stops Boushh-Some Who Loves You, Vibro Lando and Artoo- A Gift. Blast Door Controls is neccessary for the Barriers and Narrow Esacpes. Bib prevents Han from leaving the chamger, thats pretty cool. Scum counteracts Its a Traps and Narrow Esapes nicely. Major props if you can get infinite Set For Stun combo so Profit never really flips- think about it.<br>
<br>
MHYWL: Set for Stun wisely. Track your destinies and screw their testing. Search and Destroy is too easy with the DS:Docking Bay. If they try to cancel S&D by going to the Death Star, you win. Eventually, theyll put out Kessel, so make sure you save your ships. Stun Han (and Leia if you can) and lay the beats.<br>
<br>
EBO: Pretty similar to Hidden Base. Monnok rapes Xwing versions- so does Power of the Hutt. Search and Destroy is too good. Smile when they deploy Luke to the North Ridge. Elis will wreck him. Infinite Control one drain and try to set up a beatdown on their other space system.<br>
<br>
Of course, its not as easy as I write things. Great players will find ways to win, just because you got an infinite combo set up, dont get complacent. Speaking of combos, rarely will you pull off a clean retrieval for more than 3 turns. Track carefully when your Brangus retrieval gets messed up and you need to retrieve using Scum.<br>
<br>
Last, and most important rule: Dont rely on retrieval. Some games, you will be in a bad situation, and you will lose control of the Audience Chamber and Brangus. If you get dependant on retrieval to win your games, you will inevitably lose the ones when you cant retrieve. Play smart.<br>
