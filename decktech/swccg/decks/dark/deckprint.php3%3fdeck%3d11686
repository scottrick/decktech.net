the light side giving up and saying, &quot;Get that piece of<br>
SH!T  out of my face!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, first the obvious.	Use IAO to get either docking bay and the Obj, to get the war room.<br>
Onith and Tech to the Ex or Cor docking bay and try to get the Emperor to<br>
the DS docking bay.  Activate a ton of Force and tear apart your opponent&#146;s deck by getting rid of their<br>
hand.  Most deck strategies revolve around specific cards to get them off the ground.  You get rid of those key cards, then they begin to falter.<br>
<br>
Ok, defensive fire.  Great card, try to use one every turn. Scanning crew is key, whether you get someone or not.<br>
Combo?	Ok, try broken concentration on table.	Play A Dangerous time to re-arrange their force pile<br>
and put a couple of characters with the same Destiny # up top, then<br>
Scanning crew another one to the used pile, then Broken Concentration the top one on the force pile to the reserve deck.<br>
Now play close call and get rid of all 3 cards.  Sounds difficult but it is rather easy after about the third or fourth turn. Works wonders against speeder decks since<br>
most of the cards are the same destiny.<br>
<br>
Ok, I have got to stop beginning every paragraph with &quot;ok&quot;.  Basic manipulation follows:<br>
<br>
Opponent has a card in deck that can hose you?	Check his force pile as often as possible with ADT, then put that card on the top of the forcepile.<br>
If they end their Deploy phase without spending that force, just<br>
Broken Con it to the top of the reserve deck.<br>
<br>
Basically you whittle their hand down to nothing and make the lose a ton to #&#146;s and Limited resources.<br>
You&#146;d be surprised how many people this will catch off guard.<br>
YES, I KNOW HONOR OF THE JEDI WILL DESTROY THIS DECK, TRY TO KILL IT EARLY WITH CLOSE CALL. good luck doing that.<br>
Try to manipulate it out of the forcepile, but if they draw it pray to defensive fire it out of the hand.<br>
<br>
Also kill the Signals with ADT and voyeur. Set it up so they are on top of the forcepile so if they spend any force, you voyeur them out.<br>
Again, if they don&#146;t deploy, get them to the resere deck.<br>
<br>
My friend seems to be afraid of this deck since he play EBO.<br>
I can see why.	First turn, you play scanning crew to see what&#146;s in there.  EBO?  Frustration!<br>
No Echo sites in hand? Fear.  They will almost always lose two from hand rather than risk completely screwing themselves over by losing an echo site off the top.<br>
Also, not many EBO decks have number protection.<br>
<br>
All I ask is that you build it once.<br>
DON&#146;T TAKE IT TO A TOURNAMENT UNLESS YOUR FRIENDS WILL FORGIVE YOU!!<br>
And rate it KNOWING that it is only a b!tch deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
