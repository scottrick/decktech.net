Not much point putting any more cause no one reads it or the card list b4 they review so id rather not waste my time. as for podracing &#8221;fu.ck podracing&#8221;.<br>
<br>
I&#8217;d like to thank big zeq for the mind numbing review and for making me laugh. i think he sums up about 40000 people.<br>
As for lucas review i think that this is the best version and i dont think i need to alter it because if it comes to a drain race and i have my bonuses its going to be my drain of three, four, four, one, and one, with three direct damage which adds up to 16 damage a turn so i dont think i need to put in undercover spies, as for sniper/dark strike i dont know what to take out and i want four of each in thier cause i want to get them out quick and then i look a bit better cause i have four of them and it sounds scary to scrubs.  <br>
<br>
if your wondering how im gonna control my sites its simple:<br>
I deploy empy to a site that is not occupied by opponent any sites that have a rebel or some gimp there i just wipe out with maul and if that rebel is ability greater than 2 then i get an extra destiny with i have you now and i can you are beaten, choke, saber etc plus against qmc i can deploy to sites that are not control and even if you are using that mover card i simply just deploy to different sites and battle and easy screw it over i have no worrys with this deck i used the odds version for states and only got to use odds once. this meant i had only two characters to use and i still went undefeated with it. ive beaten mains, xwings, ebo variants, that dpc deck with the 7 hdwgitm, tigih speeders, mwyhl and the list will keep going. As for Aeon rate my stuff half a star i dont care what you do cause your still a cheat and you smell plus your a scrub and you play the same sh!t decks cause you cant think of any good decks at least i can build decks that work bring your qmc a$$ deck and ill play this against you and well see who wins.  <br>
<br>
Plus if you look at my previous versions there was no dark deal and i still won the drain race. Ive got dis to cancel a drain. The squadrons react which no one sees coming and there power six at bespin cause of empy +6 when i aptw so if i have one of these babys in my hand i can drop a lone inteceptor to the system and to bespin. <br>
<br>
As Garion has pointed out my destiny is low now from what i can count theres 15 destiny 4 and above which is enough for me but obviously the scrubs need 50 high destiny cards to get a good draw, I am not a scrub that one force lightning in my deck can be tracked along with srf which i believe is enough and you can lose the high destiny cards then retrieve with a tie and track it. I know how to track so dont tell me i have not got high enough destiny garion cause your a scrub. I can also track my opponents decks as well unless i play omni box. If you ever play john lampe its easy to track his destinys cause if it is orientated upside down then its a high destiny cause he cant track hes a cheater and if you verify his deck switch it around cause then he draws low and wonders why. <br>
<br>
More updates for the idiot reviews:<br>
The dark jedi hold there own sites one at each = 3 characters + 3 sites, 3-3=0 so therefore i need no more characters cause there power whatever with dark deal bonus and the bespin bonus so they can stand their ground plus i do have i have you now. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
