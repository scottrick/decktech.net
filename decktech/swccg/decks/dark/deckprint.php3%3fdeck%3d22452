<br>
(1) - Grimtaash - I have Well Guarded in the deck. One of the two We Must Accelerate Our Plans can also pull that out. Also, rarely anyone I know uses this interrupt anymore.<br>
<br>
(2) - Battle Plan - Force draining is only a side luxury of this deck design. The real damage comes from the many hits of the Destroyer Droids. Precise Attack aids in this process, particularly when aiming at Jedi. I have had opponent&#146;s pull Battle Plan out on me and quite frankly it isn&#146;t that much to pay once most of my destroyer droids are out and about.<br>
<br>
(3) - Light Side Weaponry - The large mix of Master, Destroyers and Oh, Switch Off prevents the opponent from pulling a single trigger. If they really want to play Sense, not only do I cycle the card, they lose 2 force for playing it. And after all that, I lose only one Destroyer Droid. Boo-hoo...<br>
<br>
(4) - Sense/Alter - I technically just addressed this, but I have the card out that spikes such attempts.<br>
<br>
(5) - No Dark Jedi - If you haven&#146;t noticed already, this is NOT a lightsaber combat deck. I use the objective because it pulls out the high-activation sites. These sites are also high Force drain so life is good. Also, in the event that the opponent puts down any Jedi, not only do I have Dioxis but I retrieve 1 force for removing them from Naboo. (WOOHOO!)<br>
<br>
(6) - Generator Core - Yes, I am very aware of the text on this site. Yes, if my destroyer droid is hit, it immediately cycles to the used pile. However, if you&#146;ll recall note #3, weapons don&#146;t really bother me all that much. Also, the opponent&#146;s low ability characters cycle ALSO.<br>
<br>
(7) - Honor Of A Jedi - One of my key Defensive Shields is Resistance. Now, in order to set up Resistance, I have to occupy three battlegrounds. If you read carefully, that is also the conditions necessary to neutralize Honor Of A Jedi. Problem solved!<br>
<br>
(8) - Light Side Retrieval - Endor Occupation is there to put an end to celebrations! For Off The Edge and On The Edge, I have Allegations Of Corruption. They can only retrieve so much.<br>
<br>
(9) - Dark Side Retrieval - I did have the Cloud City: Incinerator in this deck at one point. However, it took too much effort to pull it out and it just wasn&#146;t worth the force cost to retrieve. I also had EV-9D9 but everyone kept using Menace Fades. I put in one Abyssin Ornament to gain back lost forces. First Strike helps too!<br>
<br>
(10) - Menace Fades - Do you see any Force drain bonuses in this deck?<br>
<br>
(11) - Naboo: Battle Plains - The Nemoidian Advisors are in the deck to pull this and/or the Blockade Flagship: Bridge. Again, the Battle Plains are a good activation and Force drain site.<br>
<br>
(12) - Blockade Flagship: Hallway - I&#146;ve had a lot of people ask me why the heck I use this site. For one thing, it&#146;s one of FEW ways to exploit Nute Gunray&#146;s forfeit bonus to destroyer droids. Second, it&#146;s a battleground which satisfies Resistance and/or Honor Of A Jedi. If I occupy it (which I always do), the opponent cannot stroll onto the Bridge anyway. It&#146;s fun to drain their also.<br>
<br>
--- STRATEGY ---<br>
<br>
Okay, finally, here is how I actually play the deck. It isn&#146;t absolutely crucial but your first goal is to set up the Blockade Flagship: Bridge with Nute Gunray there. We Must Accelerate Our Plans pulls this site out. There are two Nute Gunrays so he should be easy to pull.<br>
<br>
Battles should be carefully calculated and operate mostly off surprise. If it is your own turn, drop as many as you can with enough force left to fire. Crossfire will keep you alive with its power bonus. That with Nute Gunray at the Bridge should solve most power issues. The damage from destroyer hits should cause the most pain for the opponent.<br>
<br>
Always save a few force for other destroyer squads unless you have Combat Readiness in your hand. If you do not have all your sites out, save at LEAST two force to set off Crossfire. I&#146;ve played Combat Readiness and drawn a zero before so beware.<br>
<br>
The Generator Core is your destroyer droid haven. Put about four there and just leave them. If your opponent is as @#$%y as mine usually are, they&#146;ll drop two (or more) Jedi with minimal support. With Dioxis, Precise Attack, and Oh, Switch Off to aid you, they don&#146;t stand a chance.<br>
<br>
If you can, take over their own domain (unless it is space of course). This deck is REALLY good at ruining the opponent&#146;s plans. You do not have to stay at Naboo. Only deploy in masses to Naboo if the opponent is either invading or not draining you for enough as is.<br>
<br>
--- END STRATEGY ---<br>

Any questions or comments? Please e-mail me at Gyro@TechEmail.com because I would really appreciate any POSITIVE feedback. Use CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. Help me out if you can. Don&#146;t just name a million cards that could ruin this deck. I am very aware of how to make a deck that specifically ruins this deck. It&#146;s all in the STRATEGY! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
