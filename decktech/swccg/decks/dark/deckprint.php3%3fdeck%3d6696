<br>
here's the low down folks. you get mara to the carbon freezing chamber. you then procede to drain there untill they come to face you. at that point you hit them with mara and then all to easy for a easy freeze. or if they don't they take a drain of 2(or 3 if you have presence on it). also scanning crew keep destiny adders from happening and to make sure that a beatdown won't occour.<br>
<br>
against specific decks.<br>
<br>
against profit- abandon strategy and just conver their ac. also start with mara and boba, pull jabba. move mara over to drain while you build up in the ac. scanning crew and your bh will hold thme off for the win.<br>
<br>
against hb- normal start. do your thing and when you scanning crew, see what they are playing. if just space, spread out and drain. if it's fake hb hold onto the ac and carbon freezing chamber. otherwise twi'lek for a security percautions and probe. this will be won.<br>
<br>
against tr mains- do the normal start and stick to the plan. if this is really big in your area put in a couple more scanning crews. there not much you can do against this other than out play them. your bounty hunters are just as strong if not stronger then their mains.<br>
<br>
against ops- start with batle order and atack atack atack. if they play a non-batle ground system, use presence on it. with s&amp;v out you can win.<br>
<br>
against insert- normal game plan. normal start. drain and drain. if this is big put in another torture.<br>
<br>
what else is their? just remember this deck is meted for this area. when you review this change like 5 cards to help against your current area. tell me the changes and review this deck. this way i'll get a hoest review of the deck idea, not a bad review cause i forgot something that's big in your area. well tell me what you think.<br>
