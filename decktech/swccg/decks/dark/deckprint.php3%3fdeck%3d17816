--ADDENDUM---<br>
<b><font color=red>Court is not a better platform for this deck. It originally was a Court deck but I found that using the Court start (granted has benefits) it allowed my opponent to come inside and get more forcedrains off on me which I didn’t like or need, MKOS offers the same amount of start and FD-1 Site and gives them the desert of which I can Sandwhirl</font color=red></b><br>
---END---<br>

<br>
Asides from what he said.......here it is.....the Dark Deck that me and my friend Alex ”Black Leader” have been working on for sooooooo long it’s not even funny. Oh, props to Alex for helping me design it originally.... anyhow I have been playing this deck for sometime now and it’s track record is quite high. It’s only lost about 2 games and of course one of them was at the ComicCon which afterwards I promptly dropped out because I was just having the worst luck ever...but that’s a moot point.<br>
<br>
The decks strategy is actually quite simple. Drop, Drain and battle... Always start with the same thing against all decks because killing retrieval, making jedi easier to hit and getting your I Have You Nows and Evader & Monnok out are very helpful.<br>
<br>
When I play, I usually get a Maul quite early, drop him at the Lower Passage or the Cantina and pretty much leave him there...his partner Dr. E is also good with him since the destinies are high and the chance of missing a Jedi is quite low. But there are those times... ya know. Try and get the gang together (Emperor, Sim and Janus) for the manipulation and Force Drain bonus... as well your space, limited as it may seem is quite efficient w/the 2 Imperial Commands you can usually get Grand Admiral Thrawn out quite quickly and then get the Chimera (there’s 2) out and there ya go. Top that off with ZiMH and your planet that your at is pretty much yours.<br>
<br>
The locations - key for adding me force, and yes I know there aren’t that many spots to Force Drain but I start with 2 that I can and all I need is the third, plus whatever my opponent offers me.<br>
<br>
Sandwhirl is ’TECH’ in here I don’t normally venture out the Deserts myself but my opponents love those force drains then I just hit them with a Sandwhirl while they run inside or run into the Desert Heart and then can’t move...so they go poof... then I drop Arica down and block the other (if need be). Force Lightning/Janus as you know that’s ’TECH’ allready and bringing back the good ole’ Restraining Bolt to kill Threepio With His Parts Showing...I can’t count the number of times that’s helped me. The rest of the cards are quite simple and used in most of the decks out there nowadays.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the deck in good health...and now for the Match Ups<br>
<br>
Against:<br>
<br>
HB<br>
Simple, take ground and force drain take your ships and drop them at the biggest drain and then hold that site. If their doing the drain and spread then drop sparidaclly and then converge in one spot so that your don’t leave yourself open. Shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Also, if it’s a flip version go for the planet that deployed 2nd to last, that’s usually it. Don’t ask why that’s just what happens (at least around here)<br>
<br>
AITC<br>
This is an easy match as well since you will just control the Lower Passage and the Cantina let them come to you. Most AITC deck run BoShuda/No Bargain so their force drain at the Chamber is nothing and then you can just run them up the wall with Force Drains and power. If their Podracing then let them. You cann try to win the race your destinies are high enough, but it’s not necessary to stack cause most people forget to leave force for retrieval.<br>
<br>
Profit<br>
Take control of the AC if you can and hold that spot you have 4 Senses to handle the Someone Who Loves You and if you can save Han from being freed there should be no problem. If he is indeed freed then use IG-88 to snag him or hit him an operate immediately thus removing him from the battle and off the board. Other than that it should be a good game.<br>
<br>
WYS<br>
Tough match cause of all the bonuses they get but like Profit, play smart and capture key characters and kill the others. If it’s Podracing then try to disuade them with quick Force Drains and remember Secret Plans. Chimera and group should be able to hold Tatooine and fufill Battle Order (most WYS have that)<br>
<br>
Most others<br>
Play intelligently and watch their game make sure that you can set up your FD’s and capture, exclude or operate on key characters. It’s a simple deck with a good theme and well rounded...<br>
<br>
Oh and before I forget, Prince Xizor is your rep. ~smirk~<br>
<br>
This deck allready has modifications in it for Courscant and when that comes out I will re-post the newer version after some major beta testing...and other thing...<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading and if you have any Q’s lmk.<br>
