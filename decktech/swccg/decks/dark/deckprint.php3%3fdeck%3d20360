On your first turn, you use Mob Pts to pull the Carida system, then you kill it to look for IAO (I was gonna use the combo but you can&#8217;t pull it with YCHF). Anyway, you smack that down, pull the Ex:db, pull Epant Mon, and stick him to the middle of your 3 Ex sites so it becomes a spy free zone. You will then usually pick up all your remaining cards, lose to Visage, and then deploy Vader next turn. The trick with this deck is to always mount offensives on your opponent. Never relieve the pressure, not even a little. Continue to deploy to his sites and disrupt his strategy. <br>
<br>
In battles, there are alot of cards in here that can help you out. Naturally, you can&#8217;t pull any of your characters (cept for Thrawn and Mon) so destiny draws are obviously going to be a little problem. Not so with Colo Clawfish. This card is terrific and will help ensure that you get those high destinies you need to clear out sites. Barrier and Bad Feeling Have I can really help out too. In combination with each other they can really slow down the LS. You&#8217;ll notice that a big part of this deck&#8217;s character base is droids. This is because with all the new LS combat decks running around, Hunt Down takes a real beating. Not so with the new unique battle droids. All of them have extraordinairy benefits that help you out in battle not only against Jedi, but other things too. SSA-1015 makes Light Side&#8217;s Jedi deploy +4 and if a Jedi is indeed there, it makes all your other battle droids power +1. 3B3-1024 cancels immunity and 888 decreases defense value by 3 (combined with Colo Clawfish it&#8217;s a helluva lot easier to hit Jedi with destroyer droids and sabers alike). 719 is just in here cause he&#8217;s power 5 with any other battle droid. I also realize that lightsabers make very nasty weapons, so I threw in Oh Switch Off so that your droids are protected against those as well. <br>
<br>
Anyway, drop Sidious at the Ex:db and the opponent has absolutely no way of getting on the Executor (cept for Jar Jar). Now you can also place his Jedi out of play as you knock them out one by one (don&#8217;t forget to cancel their game text with 4-LOM, this guy is great too). Iggy can also capture Jedi. In combination with 3B3-888 and colo claw fish he&#8217;s a menace to Jedi. Don&#8217;t dismiss the possibility of using Maul either. Just cause he&#8217;s a Jedi against a combat deck doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s useless. If your opponent has Luke down smack Maul down too, pull I Have You Now, initiate battle, and draw two more battle destinies. He&#8217;ll die next turn but who cares? Atleast you cleared away a Jedi or two. The air is pretty solid when it&#8217;s all bundled up at the same place. Avoid seperating your ships, they&#8217;re much better when working together. Use Imp Command against the Super Falcon or to pull Thrawn. Also, don&#8217;t forget about Lateral Damage. With Carida out so early it can wreck any big LS ship like Home One. If HOTJ is wrecking Visage, don&#8217;t forget about No Escape. Boba Fett, BH is simply amazing with Vader and Iggy. Together they draw 4 battle destinies. Plus the two destroyer droids that goes to a 5. Plus I Have You Now that jumps to a 6 (or 7 if the Rebel happens to be Luke). You Are Beaten is also a good card to use to exclude any pesky characters, and Wep Lev can help Vader get sum spare glowsticks.<br>
<br>
Onto the matchups:<br>
WYS: This can turn into a heated match, but by no means is it impossible. Setup as you would normally and get Vader out asap to the cantina to start draining and flip your objective. Sidious won&#8217;t be helping much so you can use him offensively as well. Your most potent weapon is SSA-306. This guy is anti-WYS. Light Side&#8217;s spies and smugglers deploy +4 to his site and they can&#8217;t apply ability toward drawing battle destiny. If all his ability can only be supplied with smugglers, then the only way he&#8217;s knocking out of any of your men is with weapons. And with Oh Switch Off, even that option won&#8217;t be available to him, and Lord Vader&#8217;s very hard to hit with a stick. Again, use Wep Lev to steal any weapons he has handy and 4-LOM to cancel game text (if Talon Karrde&#8217;s there, be sure to hit him first with 4-LOM; this way the smugglers don&#8217;t get the defense value bonus and 1024 can make any one of&#8217;em defense -3; which means it&#8217;s impossible to miss). Bad Feeling Have I should help you out a little too. Visage will hurt him alot. While you continuously assault his men on Tatooine, Visage will be trucking along and dealing it&#8217;s damage. If he&#8217;s abusing Harvest, grab it and if you really think it&#8217;s neccessary play Secret Plans shield. A Useless Gesture should be your 3rd shield so that he doesn&#8217;t abuse any lost interrupts. Play smart, and you should win.<br>
<br>
Profit: At the beginning you will have a strong foothold on Tat. The only alien you can deploy at the start of game is Boba Fett, BH, and on your first turn the only Vader you&#8217;ll have enough Force for is Vader with stick. If you do have him, deploy&#8217;em there and persona replace as soon as you can. Flip, make him lose to Visage, and watch him try to take out your well-established defense. You have 13 power first turn with 3 battle destinies. Anybody wanna battle that? Dont think so. Don&#8217;t forget to do all the other stuff you&#8217;d normally do too (e.g. pulling Carida, etc). Don&#8217;t be too worried if he frees Han. If he does, capture him with Iggy again. Bad Feeling Have I won&#8217;t help you out all that much. Use the battle droids against his Jedi and You Are Beaten to exclude any heavy hitting mains. Your destroyer droids can help out alot too knocking out the lower ability mains like Han and Chewie. Use Visage to hurt him and your multiple battle destinies to overwhelm his mains and cause mass casualties. Don&#8217;t forget about I Have You Now either. If anyone&#8217;s useful here, it&#8217;s Maul. With his double stick this guy can rape mains, as well as any other scrubs your opponent may have jumbled up on Tatooine. Anyway, don&#8217;t do anything stupid and this game should be yours.<br>
<br>
EBO: This can be a little problem. Hoth is not a battleground while the shield is up, so Vader won&#8217;t be able to join your little beat squad. Instead, leave him at the outermost marker where the shield isn&#8217;t in effect and Force drain there. Back him up with Maul and then send all your other droids in to occupy enough sites to cancel EBO. Beware of a mains beatdown. SSA-1015 will make Jedi deploy +4 to where he is so you should get him out on Hoth as soon as you can. You may want to throw in Imperial Decree so you only have to spread out to 2 Hoth sites to kill his drain bonuses. Use Visage to hurt him and use your bounty hunter ships for suprise attacks at his weaker systems. Don&#8217;t forget about Lateral Damage either, this can really help out as EBO packs strong space. You&#8217;ll probably eventually get worn down in the air but not after you take a chunk of his fleet out. You Are Beaten and Imp Barrier will help against his mains and leave Sidious at the Ex! A Jedi&#8217;s Resilience with EPP Obi and Quiggy with saber can give you a real headache. Place&#8217;em out of play and stop him from that continous cycle of smacking Jedi down. Not an impossible match, playing smart should win you the game.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that&#8217;s pretty much it for the strategy. I think I&#8217;ve covered most of the more popular Light Decks.
