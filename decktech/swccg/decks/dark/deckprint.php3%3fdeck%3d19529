<br>
for starting do iao, mob point and no try usually.<br>
you want to fish out locations with merijik if you can.  try to setup a ship or 2 at most of the systems. do rumors and setup walkers at the db and random guys + ghhhk in the bunker<br>
<br>
vs racing: well you start sebulba.  grab racing interrupts for 2 reasons. 1 they stack them then have to pay force to play more and so they cant deploy as much or afford secret plans. 2 if they do win the race, then they wont have as many lost cards to retrieve.  if its vs dagobah or other hit and run racer decks, chybc and projective are big.  wipe them out helps vs i did it.  just play smart and be ready for the suidice epps.<br>
<br>
vs wys: if its raiders, wipe them out helps.  you start a bg system so ddta doesnt hurt much.  you can setup a lone guy at the bunker and he will likely stay there all game.  tallon roll can be useful if you play it at the right time.  your ao is huge, as is guri.  grab harvest and on the edge.  you have 3 uc spys for the catina drain, as well as tarkins orders.  <br>
<br>
vs qmc: attack bespin early and stockpile stuff there.  with chiraneau and rumors you can get a drain of 5 there.  use uc spies as well as decree to slow their ground drains.  grab any &quot;edge&quot; cards and try to prevent celebration.<br>
<br>
vs new dueler: well my deck doesnt run dark jedi.  so your uc spies and decree are huge.  you will have free reign in space as the dueler seems more ground geared.  <br>
<br>
vs podprofit: drain race but you have uc spies.  <br>
<br>
vs other: play smart. drain in space.  be careful on the ground<br>
