<br>
Thanks for taking a look at my deck! Please leave any ideas or thoughts that could improve my deck.<br>
<br>
Destiny Breakdown:<br>
0*s - 4 (all can be pulled from the deck)<br>
1*s - 16 (Well good characters have low destinies)<br>
2*s - 8 (Potf, Set for Stun among others are in this group)<br>
3*s - 3 of them hehe<br>
4*s - 6 all the cool stuff, Vibro Ax, Lateral Damage, etc...<br>
5*s - yup<br>
6*s - 6 with only 2 not useful for game play (Masterful Move is just awesome!)<br>
<br>
Breakdown of the first couple of turns:<br>
<br>
Turn one:  Pull the Audience Chamber, Jabba*s Space Cruiser and a Monnok & Evader.  Drop someone to the AC if he will be able to hold the site.  Otherwise draw.<br>
<br>
Turn two:  Search for Jabba, and Boelo, and drop them.  Also search for one of the docking bays with CCT.<br>
<br>
Turn three and beyond!:  Spread out and kill and drain.  Play lateral damage, and gravity shadow at the same time if you can, it*s really cool.  Flipping the objective isn*t necessary, but it*s cool if you can.  Use your ships and bounty hunters wisly.  Try to capture Luke, Obi, or Leia with Snoova or IG, and just go hide.  Use circle, I have you now, and Vader*s Obsession when needed.  If you can capture or POOP (Place Out Of Play, nice acronym) most of their main characters, they are screwed.  Track some stuff, Set for stun Dash, and Chewie, and everything will be just dandy.  <br>
<br>
Matchups: <br>
<br>
VS EBO <br>
Well, as you may have noticed I have increased my ship count.  I*ve got Flagship Exe, ZimH, Bossk in Buss and Fett in Bubble.  Plus Virago, and Jabba*s Kruzer.  Use Lateral Damage wisely, since there will be no Super Falcon, unless they come down to rescue Han.  Resistance as noted in a review would be good, but it is not necessary, I would rather have another ship instead of that.  Set up S&D since EPP Obi, Leia, and Luke will be the only things they play.  Try and capture one of them so that they can*t go to the bacta tank every turn.<br>
<br>
VS WYS <br>
Well this is what this deck is designed to beat.  Drop your Boelo and Jabba to the chamber, and get a few ships then kill the queer at Kessel.  Capturing Luke is a must!  It is best done with a tracked 6 and IG since he cannot be battled.  Then all they will have left are scrubs.  Hahha!!!  Keep Han and Luke safe, and kill like crazy.  Keep the high destines going into the reserve deck and you should be fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
VS Profit (if it exists anymore...) This would be a ridiculous game, I flip my objective right away, and they die. Let them free han, then go kill the scrubs that rescued them.  Kill em if they try to go up to space.  Remember Snoova with ax is awesome, and there is killer destiny in this deck.<br>
<br>
VS Other stuff, then kill them. Then Drain. <br>
<br>
Reasons for other seemingly random cards:  <br>
<br>
Jabba*s Through With You - well it is a destiny 5 and adds a destiny when a bounty hunter fires a weapon.  With the magnitude of bounty hunters, it only seems natural.<br>
<br>
I Have You Now - read the card, both Palpy and Vader can use it. <br>
<br>
If you put some stupid comment and rate me low, I will do the same to you, please don*t be an a-hole and it won*t happen.  If you are going to give me a low rating there had better be a good reason.  Please just give ideas and thoughs that would help my deck.<br>
