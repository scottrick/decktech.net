<br>
<br>
Ok, start by twi&#8217;leking for Your Eyes Can Deceive you ASAP! That card is the king card! Ok, your first question is going to be, WHY THE HELL IS HE USING THAT PIECE OF JUNK CARD?! Well, the answer is simple, its one of the meanest card ever. Its pure evil. This is what you do with it. Put it down, and you make them so they cant see what cards they lose off their deck, and therefore are less likely to lose cards from their deck, because they&#8217;d be fearful of what they might lose (a key card, perhaps?). Use the fears (another mean card) to aid their losing of cards from their hand, then lay down a limited resources for a nice 4 force loss at the end of your turn, then play another during their turn for another 2 force. Thats six force you made them lose, just because they didnt want to lose cards from the top, but were forced to anyway. Now if they choose to lose cards from the top anyway (which they wont, i mean most people playing the game are not mentally ill) they will more than likely lose a key card, and not realize it. Perhaps they will even think that the card is in their force pile, draw up and waste a whole turn. The whole time visage will be pinging away at their decks/hands, helping you get limited resources down faster.<br>
<br>
Dueling helps make them lose force even faster, and you dont need focused attack since the destiny is so high (mmm sevens) and slim lou likes stopping their tracking, plus GMT cancels a destiny.<br>
<br>
Other reasons for cards:<br>
<br>
Mob Points And IAO -- obvious, for vader to get some activation.<br>
<br>
Emperor -- more activation from him, and the holotheatre<br>
<br>
Executor DB: good to D lord vader -2, for a second turn vader just about every time.<br>
<br>
Opressive Enforcement -- free grabbers, and recycles your cancelled cards<br>
<br>
Your Eyes Deceive You -- incase you missed the whole big paragraph before this, it is took make your oppenent worry about what card is on top of their deck, and make them think twice about losing from there, so you can play limited resources easier<br>
<br>
Trample -- crush jedi luke or obi instantly! many other mains die as well.... again i say, mmm sevens<br>
<br>
There&#8217;ll Be Hell To Pay -- cause i felt grabby<br>
<br>
Fear -- make their hand go away faster, so limited resources works faster<br>
<br>
Holonet -- id like another one of these, but i cant find room, since its good for stopping the ever so popular transmission terminated<br>
<br>
Twi&#8217;leks -- cause twi&#8217;leks like to go fishing, and they usually catch an effect<br>
<br>
limited resources -- read the card, its great<br>
<br>
ZiMH -- cause zuckuss is the GAND, and he stops destinies<br>
<br>
Vaders Flashlight -- cause vader is afraid of the dark scary docking bays when he is there all by him self.<br>
<br>
The Sevens -- if you dont like cards in a deck just for destiny, you must never have played with them. tramples and dueling require high destiny, and this is what works. if you are going to give me a bad review just for the destiny, dont review it.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
EBO -- EASY. this deck wreaks ketwol and barqwin ebos. they cant tell whats on top of their decks, so they die. plus hunt down is just generally good at wreaking EBOs.<br>
<br>
Profit -- ive never played a profit with this, so i cant really tell.<br>
<br>
MWYHL -- should be easy. use the fear technique to hit them hard off the top or from their hand. MWYHL can be card intensive, so make it hurt.<br>
TIGIH -- take luke with vader asap, to get a force choke on them. then use fear and eyes<br>
BHBM -- if you are playing against BHBM with a HD, you have problems, and should quit the game.<br>
<br>
dont give this a bad review without what i should change, or ill personally make you regret it. if i get a bad review, fine, but it damn well better have a reason and a way to fix it. if you are too lazy to type a paragraph, you shouldnt be on here, or reviewing this deck for that matter. thank you to those of you competent enough to type a short message to help me out.<br>
