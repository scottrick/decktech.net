Me Jesse and OCF made this deck<br>
it kicks ass<br>
i get droids out then play numbers and that whoops your ass then i get a<br>
program trap out where you have some dudes and play counter assaults so<br>
when i cancel your drain i get mad destinies eventually you blow up.. say you<br>
have four guys at the site, a 5 has to be drawn. i cancel your drain.. i draw<br>
four... 7,7,6,5 bam we all die and you lose 7+7+6+5 that = 25 thats half the<br>
game.. ha! FUN<br>
anyway otherwise i play space drain as much as i can. blowing stuff up is fun<br>
too so beat that.<br>
<br>
Vs OPS.  okay i admit this deck hurts against ops, but it stalls a bit cause you can equally drain them<br>
	 in space.  most likely theyll be playing speeder ops which will hurt your program trapping, but<br>
	 if theyre playing with op partners you can pull a little bit off otherwise play with numbers, they wont<br>
	 lose much but its all youve got<br>
<br>
Vs. Profit.  Mainly drain in space like always.  Plug some droids at the audience chamber as quick as you can, get a program<br>
	     trap on one, play numbers, when they come get han deploy vader start a battle and kill everyone, or if they drain just chase em<br>
	     try and get the PT on u3po so you can follow them so when they drain you counter assault and they blow.<br>
<br>
vs. Hidden Base.  this is a prob but BH ships can hang with xwing swarm ESPECIALLY if you get the executer out, which is why i use fondor by the way<br>
		  because as you can see there are no fondor ops.. although when i deploy the op objective with fondor people freak out .. well steve brentson did<br>
<br>
Vs. Training.  get droids to dag in the bh ships.  blow up yoda &amp; co. with training destinies, drain in space.<br>
<br>
vs. EPP swarm.	drain in space when they put all their guys together to drain and protect you smack em with a program trap<br>
<br>
vs. weather vane.  youll never play weather vane cause im the only retard that plays a complete vane deck<br>
<br>
vs. Dantooine ops.  WHAT?! Who plays dantooine ops?<br>
<br>
vs. team albany.    GOOD LUCK YOURE GONNA LOSE </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
