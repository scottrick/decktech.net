Edit #2: As to activation, the deck, as do most hunt downs, relies somewhat on the opponent. It does have the combo of Mob points to help some, though. If it proves to be a problem, I&#146;ll stick in another MM, another Holonet Transmission, Imperial Holotable, and a dockingbay or 2 more. I don&#146;t like the holotable, as I only have 1 card to stop TT, but the deck probably needs it anyway. I also like Holonet Transmission better than This is some rescue, as it actually cancels the specific card, and it can be pulled. I know the destiny sucks, but I believe in functionality too.<br>
<br>
Edit #3:4 vaders are enough. 4 vaders mean that 4/51 ratio. I draw opening 8, and if none are there I have a 4/43 ratio. statistically, I should get a vader by the 3rd turn.<br>
<br>
first: This deck is still in the playtesting process, but seems to kick butt. It went undefeated at a local tourny recently (I know, I know, big whup) kicking the crap outta senators of all kinds, Totooinians (sorry Crummyplayer), and beat a good HB. That was before the modifications, and the deck above is the end result. <br>
<br>
Standard beats/duelling, with the addition of maul and maul strikes. This will single handedly kill most Senate/Council decks, as well as the combination of other nasty interrupts to hurt jedi.<br>
<br>
A FEW CARD DESIRES: things I want to add, but got no room right now: <br>
Put All Sections On Alert<br>
SAC<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
pretty much the same as most huntdowns. Save maul for the surprise duel/beats. Drop him with Mara on the council, then duel away the jedi. Lots of tech versus HB, as I think that is the biggest threat.<br>
<br>
against the Senate, CHYBC is gold. This will stop their drains at the Senate. just deny them the rest of ground, thus most of their retrieval (amidala) is negated. If they are all out space, use mauls ship to block force drains and satisfy battle order. Use S&D + visage + drains to make em hurt.<br>
<br>
HB is similar: Force Lightning + Sniper for the spies, Mauls ship + Security Precautions ensure killing the obj, and Its Worse makes them lose the force<br>
<br>
Against Mains, just beat em up. You have some tech cards that are new to stop jedi as well as the new card They Are Still Comeing Through. TASCT will probably win you games against WYS, but again, the deck is still in playtesting.<br>
<br>
Against RST:Play smart, duel their jedi (if any) and beat em up. I haven&#146;t run it against an rst deck yet, but it should be a good game. My thoughts: the racing version runs too few characters to be a threat. the key to beating the deck is taking over the rebel landing site first turn, and your characters are all good for that. I&#146;ll know more later.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking time to review this deck. I want<br>
to thank everybody who helped me with this for all the help.<br>
<br>
Thanks, and enjoy    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
