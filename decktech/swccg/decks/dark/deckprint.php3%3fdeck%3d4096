I built this deck for playtesting purposes, and it turned out to be a real good deck. Me and Patrek played like 6-7 games today, although i only played differnt kinds of mains i think it has a good chance to other decks as well.<br>
<br>
starting location should be the coruscant system unless opponent starts hidden base, then go for the imperial square.<br>
<br>
4 JP are included, i really need the audience chamber to get the deck gonig. Also, this gives me a huge advantage against profit decks which should stand no chance. Also, this deck needs a very small amount of force to be running, with scum, jabba and chal bekan my aliens deploy rather cheep. Choke decks are therefore not a problem, and i also got evader and crush the rebellion (also for anti-clash which hurts this deck) for revolutions on my starting location.<br>
<br>
I got drain potential with the isb agents. mostly i wont need my own drain locations, those are in if i face opperatives, space and other defensive decks. But mostly i dont need them, as i said.<br>
<br>
Usually start oppressive enforcenemt, a good all round effect which protects against S/A/C. Grapplers are also a must in all dark decks.<br>
<br>
Barriers, none shall pass and elis are all protection against beatdown, but if you play against mains you should still be very careful so you wont suffer from a beatdown. Basicly you will only need to control one site if you play mains, since you will drain much more than they will. You also have the potential of making a beatdown.<br>
<br>
Hidden base is handeled by draining him ASAP before he flips. 4 ships, sec.prec and lots of aliens as attrition fother should be enough to probe him, just stay away of the falcon.<br>
<br>
opperatives is no problem, start ABC, protect it with a shop and then drain him, if he plays speeders stay indoors.<br>
<br>
against undercovers there are bubo and a sniper. sniper is also great otherwise, and also kicks with IG88 against key guys such as beru or owen against harvest and han against profit decks (though profit was no problem).<br>
<br>
cards that could go in:<br>
Dengar with blaster<br>
omnibox/shocking revelation (only got 3 recycleables + barriers, none shall pass and signal, you can track when you retrieve though)<br>
another mara jade (not so sure about it though)<br>
ghhhk<br>
Disarmed!<br>
<br>
This deck probably explains itself, enjoy!<br>
