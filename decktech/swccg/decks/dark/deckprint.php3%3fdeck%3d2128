Don't forget to pick up Vader if he's stuck and you have to kill someone, especially if he's disarmed or pissed off (Uncontrollable Fury).  Use Evazan and Disarmed to kill people (there are 4 guys w/built in guns).  Hopefully, early in the game, you can force-choke your opponent, as you only give them 1 icon. Track your destiny and pick your fights.	Try and get someone to the holotheatre to stop spies cancelling Visage.  Get HoloNet Transmission early w/Masterful Move.  Later in the game, try to get out the Incinerator to retrieve droids (there are 3).	Other than that, play your opponent's game while keeping Visage going.<br>
<br>
<br>
vs.  Hidden Base<br>
<br>
Probably your toughest matchup.  Flip ASAP.  Get Battle Order, Security Precautions and Search and Destroy ASAP.  Beat up anyone who comes to the ground.  Grapple ICBW.  Don't be afraid to put extra guys/walkers on ships as forfeit fodder even if they aren't piloting.	You might want to put off probing for a while if you can get Bubbles in Ship + Passengers w/ forfeit &gt; 5 + Probe card at Kessel.  Keep a guy at the Holotheatre and make sure you don't get beatdown.<br>
<br>
vs.  Ops<br>
<br>
This may or may not be tougher than HB.  Start Battle Order.  Get Vader down to the Farm.  Don't deploy ships other than Vader's Shuttle and Bubbles in Ship to their planet, because they'll just get clawed.  Battle where possible.  Set up ABCTTU as quickly as you can.<br>
<br>
vs.  Toshe Station Mains<br>
<br>
I'm not too sure what to start here.  Maybe try Security Precautions so that you can flip first turn.	Don't be afraid to over deploy to Toshe Station; it's the most important location in the game.  Make sure you get some tough guys at the holotheatre.  Use Evader in conjunction with CHYBC to stop them draining w/revolutions.<br>
<br>
vs.  Revo Job<br>
<br>
Mmm...	Tough.	Hopefully you can Evader once before it gets stacked.  I'm not sure whether or not to start CTR or IAO.  As with vs. most mains, protect Visage and a battleground from beatdown.  I don't think that this deck will be too popular now, but if you can make it work with CTR it's gotta be strong.<br>
<br>
vs.  Numbers<br>
<br>
I forgot any #s protection because Resistance requires 3 battlegrounds (they'll be able to occupy at least 1) and I couldn't find room for Torture.  Set up Search And Destroy quickly and don't activate much unless you have to.  HoloNet Transmission is critical.<br>
<br>
vs.  Training<br>
<br>
WTF!  Who plays this?  Get out Search and Destroy quickly.  Deploy Secret Plans.  Try to drain only w/walkers and Vader+Tarkin to minimise damage from surprise assault.  Grapple On The Edge.	Your best chance is to cause as much damage as possible as early as possible.<br>
<br>
I would like to add at least 2 Tortures and an extra Visage, but I'm not sure what to take out.  Maybe 1 Masterful Move can become a Visage.  Also, you might consider adding an Unexpected Interruption and/or First Strike.	Blizzard 2 could become an extra Dune Walker and you could add an extra Igar.  Dreadnaughts could also become Death Squadron Star Destroyers and the Executor: Docking Bay could be added to be more competitive in space.<br>
