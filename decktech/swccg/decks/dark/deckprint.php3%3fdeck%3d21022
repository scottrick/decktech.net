What&#8217;s up with that?  switch it back in for the Nemoidian advisor, you don&#8217;t need the hallway that much anyway.  also, SAC hurts this deck pretty bad, so if its really popular in your area drop Wipe them out for There is not Try & Oppressive Enforcement to get the jump on them.  end update***<br>
<br>
Pretty fun deck, really.  At least, I always think Sith and Toys decks are fun, and this one has the tools to win.  Get out Image of the Dark Lord, the Deploy-killer Droids (and don&#8217;t forget that most Han and Chewies are smugglers), and Bad Feeling Have I for the choke.  When they deploy a Jedi, Barrier it and put a combat card on Maul.  If they try to initiate battle, Stunning Leader them.  if that doesn&#8217;t work, use I have you now and maybe maul strikes to get the advantage, and force field to protect maul and vader.  then next turn, if you can manage a sure win, go ahead and Maul Strikes a duel during the activate phase or drop a combat card and kill &#8217;em in move phase.  combating in move phase causes more force loss generally, but dueling can allow you to Finger of Death somebody and usually drain.  the key is to avoid battle and use other sneaky means to get rid of Jedi.  once you&#8217;ve gotten enough guys off the ground, drop the mob points combo for Search and Destroy.<br>
<br>
in space, try to hold Gall to really improve those battle droid blaster rifles and stop Battle Plan from hurting, even putting 4LOM on the Mist Hunter for the extra destiny.  against Menace Fades, don&#8217;t worry about their system, concentrate on taking over all their battleground sites with Boba Fett, 4LOM and Mara, then drop SnD.<br>
<br>
remember with that droid out, verify your opponent&#8217;s deck every time and place their Jedi and Han (the center of a han/chewie/leia beatdown) out of play....its fun.<br>
<br>
OK, matchups:<br>
against Profit: start Mara and Fett at the Chamber but you MUST back them up with somebody or they&#8217;ll just get crushed...preferably a Sith, then pull I Have You Now right away.  don&#8217;t forget to take out Ben Kenobi before you aim your weapons at Han, or he&#8217;ll just keep coming back.  Do whatever it takes to keep their objective on the 0 side.  i feel that this is one matchup you have to meet head on, don&#8217;t give them a chance to get started.<br>
<br>
against WYS: hold the Cantina with whatever you can.  get the anti-WYS droid out quick with the Hallway or whatever to protect your Sith from the WYS-style beatdown.  don&#8217;t forget to use the shield against them, it helps but don&#8217;t expect it to win for you.  this is another matchup you have to be aggressive in, but not as much as Profit.  Watch out for Portals, if they&#8217;re strong in your area just don&#8217;t go to docking bays, Inconsequential Barriers doesn&#8217;t do much against the Patrol Craft variety of WYS.<br>
<br>
against LSC: Fun matchup.  Grab their Blow Parried so they stop screwing your combat cards, and make sure to use Janus to track all those 7&#8217;s to the top everytime they get to combat you.  if this deck is prevalent in your area, you might wanna pack Lathe or the Omni Box Combo to throw off their tracking.<br>
<br>
against Hidden Base/EBO: hold your ships in reserve and then blast them when they try to spread out and drain.  draw early against Hidden Base so the flip side doesn&#8217;t hurt you.  SnD will be instrumental in this game but you have to keep kicking them off the ground.<br>
<br>
other than that, i guess you&#8217;re on your own.  have fun, this deck is built for good times.<br>
