Please tell me if anything wrong with deck catches your eye.<br>
<br>
Oh and if there is anything that Cancels Choke please tell me in your review.<br>
<br>
I decided to play this deck because I have been an avid COTVG player and I&#146;m always force defficient so I thought if I play a deck that is allready force efficient I should be able to be able to play what I want when I want.<br>
<br>
When starting Jabba&#146;s Palace when you start the game you can pull out all your JP sites so you can have monster activation Compared to a regular COTVG deck not being able to pull sites, unfortunatly it has the drawback of not being able to give direct damage and being able to play Independent ships is what you pay for better activation and better drain sites with Gailid.<br>
<br>
Basicaly the strat with this deck is to pull all your sites, Gailid, Scum then prepare to battle only when you are sure you can win for example Guri will stop those pesky main Characters(han, luke, leia, and chewie) from drawing a crazy 5+ destiny draws. Also an other integral part of this deck is Scum n First Strike combo battle retrieve 3 opponent lose 1 isn&#146;t it fun when you do that but if it isn&#146;t obvious they can benifit from First Strike too. A defencive and a cowardly offencive card is Projective Telepathy, with this card if your opponent deploys and use&#146;s every thing ecxept one and battles cancel the battle or if you have for example your whole Audience protection on the top of your lost pile(Boelo, Ephant Mon, Mighty Jabba) then if First Strike is out you can Battle 8 mains with Evazan and cancel your own battle to retreive 3 and oponent loses 1 just to get those cards back or to get around Order to Engage by canceling your own battle and retreive 2 or 3 and opponent loses one. Just use cheesy techness to do that sort of thing, also there is the Ghhhk combo card in here so Ebo Hyper Escape is useless. <br>
<br>
Have fun if your going to try this deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
