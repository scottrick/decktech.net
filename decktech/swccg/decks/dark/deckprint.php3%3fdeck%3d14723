Strategy<br>
In the first turn before you activate, pull Executor with Mob points if Executor is not in hand.  Use Imp Commands to get Thrawn if not able to draw him. Drop the Executor and Thrawn in space when you have enough force and have an Imp command in hand just in case they want to play.  Drop the supporting bounty hunter ships and Chimaera throughout the game. When you get your Admiral&#146;s order out you can pull combat vehicles and since you occupy Tatooine your opponent draws no more than one battle destiny at related sites.  When you get the Emperor out put overseeing it personally on him to add to all your drains on tatooine where you have an imperial(every character with ability is an imperial). When you occupy two tatooine sites, drop tatooine occupation. Now your opponent will be taking drains of at least two at every Tatooine site and 1 more for every site thanks to Occupation.  Just keep dropping Imps all over tatooine, the characters are all really powerful.<br>
<br>
Match ups<br>
vsHidden Base-Just play it normal stick to holding tatooine but if you see coruscant comeout storm it with everything but the executor and thrawn, leave them to hold Tatooine.  If it&#146;s hidden base mains make sure you get out your anti retrieval effects and your admiral&#146;s order so they only get one battle destiny at each site. You should have no problem just play it smart.<br>
<br>
vsEBO-This is a hard one, just stick to tatooine and get everything out as fast as possible, hopefully you can outdrain your opponent on tatooine, if you see no major ground characters, spread out on tatooine and drain as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
vsWYS-This should be no problem.  Just make sure you have the executor with thrawn flying above tatooine with your admiral&#146;s order out. If they try to take tatooine just use Imp commands to limit there destinies to 1 draw. Once you get your admiral&#146;s order out and you have a firm grip on tatooine, they won&#146;t be able to take ground if they can only draw one battle destiny. If they harvest make sure you have the anti retrieval effects out and storm the farm, you can even add a trooper felth in here to completely shut down their harvests.<br>
<br>
vsRST-Your drains are going to be much larger than theirs, no problem.<br>
<br>
vsJedi training- As long as you get your occupation out, you should have no problem, they won&#146;t be able to catch up with you once you are all set up.<br>
<br>
If there are any other big decks for light being played in your area, i&#146;m sure this can beat it. I hope you have fun playing this deck, I know I do.<br>
