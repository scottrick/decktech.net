<br>
*All Locations out by 2nd turn, unless playing Profit or Agents in the court, still have them out fast against the latter<br>
*ok destiny average, but it gets REALLY high once you pull out those locations and the low destiny characters like jabba, bib, ephant,..., and also when the obj is flipped and u have jabba and bib on table, thats another +2!<br>
*on that note, there are six cards which can add destinies<br>
*make sure to try and get this combo at the AC:Jabba, Bib, Ephant, 4-LOM, and Gailid - 3 destinies, cancel a text, and boosted drains as well as boosted chevin power.<br>
*VADER??!!What the.....   okokokok  I know he suspends scum but he is there for surgical strikes - an annoying main, pucumir, tessek, etc...  drop, rattle, and roll on over to the lost pile<br>
*the sail barge gets me over the desert heart with no prob<br>
<br>
I chose chevins over abyssins b/c I only have access to 1 myo, regeneration gets costly after a few abyssins, and chevins can go for all attrition<br>
<br>
Against AITC/NLFTE<br>
just make sure to get a guy to the Hutt trade route fast to deploy the locations<br>
should not be that hard b/c most people use eloms so all I do is not deploy my imps<br>
defend the AC<br>
deploy an alien to the AC using its game text before it gets converted<br>
when it does get converted, put gailid and mara there to get a drain of 4<br>
<br>
Against Profit<br>
Start Mara and Gailid - drain of 3 first turn!<br>
drop her saber for a 4 drain next turn<br>
get all the combos together to whoop them up<br>
Ephant prevents a boushh/ spy invasion<br>
<br>
Against speeders<br>
stay inside and drain<br>
get an occasional battle in if it will not hurt too bad<br>
use multiple destinies<br>
<br>
Against CC decks<br>
never had a prob with these decks doubt I ever will.<br>
just control them and drain them at their own sites, simple as that<br>
done it before, do it as many times as I need to<br>
<br>
Against hidden base<br>
Get out hutt influence so they cannot cancel the drains<br>
probe/ occasional battles to soften them up<br>
drain the hell out of them as fast as you can - this is where a fast set up comes in handy<br>
<br>
Against MWYHL<br>
use multiple destinies to kill anyone they send over, including luke/leia<br>
if they give a system to use, go to dagobah and chase yoda around - it is so fun hehehe. especially with 4-LOM.<br>
<br>
Against ops<br>
use hutt influence so they cannot modify your drains, beat up on lonely operatives, stay home and drain<br>
<br>
<br>
tell me if u think I should do this plz:<br>
start no bargain instead of IAO, switch the DB for another JP site<br>
<br>
<br>
Well theres not much more to my area, if you have any tips/hints plz tell me<br>
thx<br>
