fact, the drains are weak in this deck.  But<br>
everyone eventually deploys to Tatooine (cuz they<br>
don&#146;t wanna lose a force to Court), and that&#146;s<br>
when I capture and feed.  Plus, most people come<br>
to Tatooine *expecting* me to eventually get some <br>
big drains going, so like I said, I eventually get<br>
them to come.<br>
<br>
If not, I setup drains at Sullust and Tatooine,<br>
setup Occupation and Search &amp; Destroy, and hope I<br>
win.  Its pretty easy to get my systems w/Merrijk,<br>
then I put him in Zuckuss&#146; ship so he doesn&#146;t <br>
suspend Scum.  My aliens deploy dirt cheap when<br>
Jabba, Chall, Scum, and the Sail Barge are out.<br>
If all 4 are out (and at the same site), my aliens<br>
deploy -4!  Usually Jabba and Chall are at the <br>
Chamber, while the Barge is at the Pit, so my <br>
aliens deploy -3 to either site.  Barge can be <br>
pulled, Scum can be drawn or Twi&#146;leked for, and<br>
the Chamber can pull an alien once per game to<br>
help me setup those 4 for cheap deploy.<br>
<br>
common matchups:<br>
<br>
vs. WYS<br>
<br>
Let them have Tatooine, just build up at the<br>
sites.  Then deploy ships to the docking bay, <br>
using the barge w/aliens to defend the ships.  <br>
When you&#146;re ready, move the ships up to greet Dash<br>
and Mirix, and battle &#146;em the hell outta there!<br>
If they move away to Kessel, just follow.  The <br>
Admiral&#146;s Order works great since they only get 1 <br>
destiny on Tatooine.  Just hope they don&#146;t<br>
replace it.  If they do, obviously track that 6!<br>
<br>
vs. HB, Y4, EBO, or Tatooine mains<br>
<br>
Build up at your 2 BG sites, Jabba will be the <br>
alien you almost always pull (maybe Chall if you<br>
want the Merc Pilot w/him).  Twi&#146;lek or draw for<br>
Scum, deploy aliens for cheap.  Don&#146;t capture <br>
unless you can hold on to that captive.  there&#146;s<br>
nothing worse than having captives escape.  You<br>
want to feed them to Sarlacc.  So capture guys <br>
like lando, Solo, chewie, and scrubs for easy<br>
meals.  Leave the ability 4 guys alone unless <br>
that&#146;s all you have to feed.<br>
<br>
vs. EBO, HB space decks<br>
<br>
You should be able to occupy a BG system <br>
(preferably Tatooine w/Occupation).  Put forfeit<br>
fodder on Bossk&#146;s ship and Jabba&#146;s Cruiser.<br>
Watch for xwing cannons (in any deck).  Setup<br>
Search &amp; destroy to hurt the light side, hopefully<br>
they deploy to Tatooine so you can get a meal for<br>
Sarlacc.  Hutt Influence protects your drains.<br>
<br>
vs. Rebel Strike Team<br>
<br>
Kill Crix.  He is key.  If not, they&#146;ll pull Cpl.<br>
Midge who adds 1 to force drains at Endor sites.<br>
That will finish you.  U-3PO can block a drain, <br>
but S&amp;D will be useless.  Tat Occupation can help,<br>
and buildup at Tatooine sites, looking for Elis.<br>
Then Elis to Endor (whether Insurrection is out<br>
or not), and battle &#146;em up.  Don&#146;t capture cuz<br>
you&#146;ve got nowhere to take the captives to.<br>
<br>
vs. TIGIH<br>
<br>
Tough matchup (in my experience).  You&#146;ve got the<br>
power to take Luke out though, especially if you<br>
buildup at Tatooine and Elis over.  Typically this<br>
decktype plays Fallen Portal, which stings.  But<br>
if they deploy to Tatooine, capture and feed.  It<br>
can be a 10-12 force swing, even more in some <br>
cases.<br>
<br>
vs. Profit/Agents in the Court<br>
<br>
Don&#146;t like having the Chamber converted.  Use CC<br>
Engineer to reconvert.  If they use Underworld<br>
Contacts, the site will be converting constantly.<br>
Hopefully you outactivate them and since your guys<br>
deploy cheap, you&#146;ll have force to convert more <br>
than they can.  At least you&#146;re almost certain to<br>
have them deploy to tatooine so you can get <br>
captives.  I start Jabba &amp; Chall (w/CC Enginner) <br>
against Profit.<br>
<br>
vs. MWYHL<br>
<br>
Lock down your 2 sites, play S&amp;D.  Try to setup<br>
Tat Occupation too, and lock down the system.<br>
They&#146;ll probably play Honor, but you can get 3 BGs<br>
pretty quick.  Plus that 2 extra force Dagobah <br>
gives you can go a long way.  Heck, I&#146;ve even<br>
invaded Dagobah w/Bossk&#146;s ship carrying a hit<br>
squad on like the 5th or 6th turn!<br>
<br>
FAQs<br>
<br>
Xizor?  Snoova?  Don&#146;t have much Reflections 2 <br>
yet, but those 2 aliens will definetely go in once<br>
I get them (which will be soon).<br>
<br>
More Tatooine sites?  With more sites, it becomes<br>
too easy to occupy a Tatooine BG, making my Court<br>
damage useless.  By limiting where they can <br>
deploy, they play right into my hand.  If they <br>
deploy to the pit, what if I have Sarlacc in hand?<br>
It&#146;ll eat their guys right up.<br>
<br>
Small drains?  Hey, I can handle big drains.  With<br>
Occupation, its like an extra drain, plus Court<br>
damage is another drain.  When they deploy to <br>
Tatooine, the damage Sarlacc causes is huge.  I<br>
try not to rely on Sarlacc, but I guess its a <br>
pretty big part of my deck.  But I have won<br>
several games without feeding.<br>
<br>
This deck is 5-7 in tournament play, and has <br>
played virtually every decktype (except RST).  <br>
TIGIH seems to give this deck the most trouble.  <br>
