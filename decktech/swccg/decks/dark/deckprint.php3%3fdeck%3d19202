<br>
EDIT-----------Replace a SCIMITAR SQUAD with THE PHANTOM MENACE--------<br>
<br>
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE ACTVATION---I GET IT EVERYTIME, thats the beauty of the deck it is strong and cheap, plus restricting your own force make syou pick your battles and wait for you opponents mistakes to capitalize on them-this is not a throw cards down when you can hope you have enough power to cause your oppoinent to lose half his pile and if you cant you lose deck!  This is a more advanced deck that requires a tad bit more strategy and thought, i should have MERJ but I cant find him so ill give you guys that one.<br>
<br>
--sorry for the rant just makes me angry when people critisize me for things I already explain please read below<br>
::::<br>
<br>
START<br>
deploy your stuff, You may chose TPM instaed of the COMBO to start--the reason the combo is there higher destiny that reg mob points. you FIRST TURN BEFORE YOU, pull KUAT drop that, there you went from 2 force to 5 in less than a turn, if you get some sites in you opening hand throw those too.  Some say this starts slow but thta is a misconsceptiino they thing about this deck is that it is REAL CHEAP POWER in the Sabers and Scythes so froce choke is inconiquential<br>
<br>
EARLY - MID GAME<br>
Find there &#148;homeworld&#148; and take control of the system- you need it to start collapsing interior sites doing this gets rid of drains against you, chokes their force and takes out characters-- your ground force is small but effective use Bombing run to take ot the exterior guys.<br>
Space? No prob, tallon roll their fighters and your destroyers are more than powerful enough to take out the rest no real contest here.<br>
Niemodian advisor - to get systems<br>
SFS - retieval, TIES go to USED PILE WHEN LOST remeber taht SACRIFICE your bombers and recycle those 7s -- Planetary subjudication allows my bombers to be destiny 7, if you didnt know --<br>
<br>
LATE - GAME<br>
Just keep doing this bomb and drain, you should have bombed them to submission and your control of the vaccuum should be finalized good work!<br>
<br>
<br>
Match Ups<br>
<br>
WYS- Bomb the docking bay and cantina, and any othe DB they throw, ususally scrub frieghters and pilots kill these guys, watch for SUPER Falcon and Outrider they can cause problems.  DONT CONCENTRATE TOO MUCH ON BOMBING STUFF THIS GAME-I did that and lost to one where in the begining I was kicking ass.  when they deploy to a site control the system with a fleet and cut them off<br>
<br>
EBO- EASY WIN, The Shield makes them immune to the RUN but NOT collapsing--I got a ruling on tha one, wierd but dems the breaks, it wont stop the effect but it will choke them off, SPACE is easy win, control Sullust and make them lose 8 for canceling Haven-i have NEVER seen an EBO without it<br>
<br>
QMC-Used to be cake but since that effect its made it harder, Bomb the interior sites, dont go down unless you have to, I am 6-1 against these decks, the one loss I lost by two in a End game Drain race, I lost but a fantastic game<br>
<br>
RST- Bomb the bunker if they are playing that, get it before they do, usually fighters and talas for space easy win there, Bomb Run the scouts at the exterior sites, they are mostly all dest 2 or 3 so a good draw could take like half of them out<br>
<br>
MBO-easy, takes too long to get Good effects just Kill Y4 EASTY WIN<br>
<br>
LS SENATE-Bomb the senate ---- game over<br>
<br>
I love this deck it is VERY successful if played right. Dont forget the bombers they are the most underatted ships in the game but with R3 coming out it might make things harder for them enjoy it while you can!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
