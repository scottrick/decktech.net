In response to reviews, Organa's Ceremonial Necklace doesn't work on Raltiir, only Yavin 4. Also Secret Plans and Search and Destroy are awesome. Secret Plans can keep your opponent from massive retrieval in the late game. I like to use Ability x3 in the late game to speed things up a little and I use Empire's New Order for retrieval against Eloms or aliens. If you want more ships take out Ability x3 and Empire's New Order for a Star Destroyer and/or a Dreadnaught.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is a remake of an old deck of mine. I played my old Rops deck around March-May where it only lost 3 games. All its losses were to Derek Halpern (1897). Now that DSII is out, I am remaking it with some new cards. The title is inspired by the Dreamcast game: Gundam Wing Sidestory 0079 Rise Up From The Ashes.<br>
<br>
Basically you pull a Raltiir site, Executor Docking Bay, and Wakeelmui on your first turn and put some dude at the docking bay. Then you get a minimum of 7 force. Then you keep pulling stuff until you have alot of activation and you flip. Then use the flip side of the objective to pull stuff from your reserve and battle them with +3-4 to your battle destiny. You should be able to kick them off most of their locations plus Overseeing It Personally gives you extra drains and Empire's New Order can provide retrieval (especially against Eloms).<br>
<br>
Locations: The generic sites and Raltiir are necessary to flip. The Hoth sites are for activation or for setting up Imperial Decree. Wakeelmui and Executor DB are for activation while Kashyyyk is for a battleground system. The Death Star and the War Room are so you can use Sergeant Torent.<br>
<br>
Characters: Most of the 2/2 guys are decent pilots and can go to Executor DB for Mob Points +2 activation. These guys are also good with Imperial Arrest Order for forfeit fodder. Vader and IG-88 are for battling and the Emperor is for setting up Overseeing It Personally. Janus is for support on Raltiir or maybe battling somewhere. Igar and his walker are good to battle with and the AT-ST pilots are for automatic draws with the AT-ST's. Torent gives you a nice little drain if you put him on the Death Star and it's orbitting Raltiir.<br>
<br>
Ships: The bounty hunter ships all have neat effects on the opponent's ships. Dengar is to get rid of Home One, the Falcon, or some ship with immunity as well as swarm decks. Zuckuss makes it so they need 7 ability to draw battle destiny. Fett can hold a system by himself, Bossk is an automatic draw, and the Dreadnaught is for loading pilots up on and battling.<br>
<br>
Vehicles: The AT-ST's are for reacting around, protecting Raltiir and Tempest 1 is for Igar.<br>
<br>
Interrupts: Ghhhk is for your guys at the docking bays or if they just beat you down with like 10 Eloms. Prepared Defenses is your starting interrupt. Barrier is to protect from beatdown and Shut Him Up or Shut Him Down is to cancel Bacta Tank or Death Star Plans.<br>
<br>
Effects: IAO is to help you pull docking bays, help out your 2/2 guys, and to prevent Nabrun beatdowns. Mob Points is to pull Wakeelmui and to give you extra activation at docking bays. Secret Plans, Come Here You Big Coward, Battle Order, and Imperial Decree help stop drains or retrieval. Oppressive Enforcement so your grabbers get out free and for S/A. Ability x3 and S&D help punish non-interactive decks or to close up a game while Empire's New Order helps you retrieve when your opponent uses aliens (especially Eloms, Operatives, and Ewoks). Overseeing It Personally gives you a nice drain of 2 at each Raltiir site if Emperor is at a Raltiir site you control. Grabbers are for abusive interrupts. Security Precautions is to help against Hidden Base or to give you some activation. Reactor Terminal puts cards back in your reserve deck and let's you track. Lateral Damage is to hurt space decks like EBO or HB. Blast Door Controls cancels Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier.<br>
<br>
Now this is customized to my local meta. If you want to include SAC just pull out some junk and you can add another grabber or add odds protection or anything you want. I think a Trample or two would be nice in here and maybe an Overload. Here's some strategy:<br>
<br>
Vs. Profit<br>
Should be pretty easy. Use IG-88 to capture Han back use your massive battle destinies, drain on Raltiir and in space. Use Blast Door Controls especially.<br>
<br>
Vs. Mains<br>
Pretty hard. They get lots of activation and can beat you down. Try to set up fast with lots of activation. React around to prevent beatdown.<br>
<br>
Vs. Eloms<br>
Hard matchup I think. Use Empire's New Order to retrieve when they lose Eloms. Set up fast and in space. Reacting is big here as well as huge destinies.<br>
<br>
Vs. There Is Good In Him:<br>
Flip fast, drain, use massive battle destinies and Lateral Damage and your bounty hunters ships. Might want to grab Luke to like Executor docking bay or something like that.<br>
<br>
Vs. Endor/Farm<br>
Same as above really. Use Lateral Damage, BH ships, massive battle destinies and kill him with drains on the ground.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hidden Base<br>
Don't deploy until after he flips and then probe all the systems. Search and Destroy will hurt him. If he goes to the ground beat him down. Early ground drains will hurt him.<br>
<br>
Vs. EBO<br>
Try to set up and flip. Get Decree out and drain him on the ground. S&D might help and if he comes out beat his guys down. Use space fleet and Lateral damage. Pile up pilots on the Dreadnaught.<br>
<br>
Vs. Anything else<br>
Just flip and get the deck going. Battle him where he is and if he comes to you react and kill him.<br>
<br>
I tried to cover most of everything. Your suggestion are welcome.<br>
