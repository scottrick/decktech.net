<h4>Props to Mike Gemme and Evan Fitzgerald.</h4> By looking at their decks, I came up with this. I had Sith Furies in it but that didn’t work out. Sorry if it looks like I’m copying decks or whatever. My version actually uses Tat Maul and two Coruscant ones plus two double bladed sabers. I just think the deck works better with the EPP’s (I don’t ownany Theed cards though). This deck still isn&#146;t original but I thought it was fun so I&#146;m sharing it.<br>
<br>
Take out Intruder Missile and Double Laser Cannon for Blast Door Controls and Rise My Friend. Take out an Emperor and an Imperial Supply for Counter assault x2. I don’t really know why I need two Emperors if hes at his throne room.<br>
--- END UPDATE ---<br>
<br>
This is a fairly fun deck I made. Just win battles and then stack a 1, 1, 7 with Drop and win. This deck is 1-0. It beat Brad Vogel’s WYS by 11 by turning Luke. He played Bith Shuffle on me too but I got lucky =)<br>
<br>
Early Game:<br>
<br>
Turn 1 you pull Emperor to the Throne Room, get I Have You Now, and Force Lightning. Hopefully pull the 1/0 docking bay, if not a 1/1 is fine. Try to get out the Bridge. <br>
<br>
Turn 2 you hopefully get out a Vader. Now if they give you Luke, fine. But if they put him somewhere else, you drop EPP Maul and play I Have You Now. They lose a lot of overflow for that...<br>
<br>
Mid Game:<br>
You should either be draining or dueling with Vader. And you should hopefully be killing off their guys with yours. Eventually you will have 2 cards stacked and then you stack a 1, 1, 7 with Drop and win the game. Not hard.<br>
<br>
Late Game:<br>
If you’re here, you probably lost or something...<br>
<br>
Card choices: <br>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with 4-Lom is great for suicide missions or clearing out a system. Just watch out for Cannons. <br>
<br>
Set for Stun can pop someone back to their hand with a tracked 7. Say if they have Han with Chewie. Set For Stun Chewie and kill Han with I Have You Now and overflow. <br>
<br>
Unsalvageable cancels some cool stuff so why not put it in. I tried to get rid of most forms on battle evasion so this went in.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
Mains: Kill them off with your weapons and try to win battles with Emperor’s Power<br>
<br>
Space: Zuckuss with 4-Lom and Emperor’s power is 3 destinies. Just try not to get shot down. Harder to get cards stacked in this one but if you use Zuckuss twice to win a battle, you win.<br>
<br>
WYS: Put Vader in the Cantina and bring Luke back to the Death Star II for dueling. Stay on Cloud City so they can’t play It’s a hit and they are limited to two destinies. <br>
<br>
LSC: Try to kill them off with Maul and company. All you need to do is win two battles. Aurra is big in this one. You can hit any Jedi with her and a tracked seven.         </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
