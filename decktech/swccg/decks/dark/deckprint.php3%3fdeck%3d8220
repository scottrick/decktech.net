It's main source of power is from the walkers and Crossfire.  On the ground it is deadly, what with Vader and Tarkin cancelling battle destiny, Vader adding one to each of your battle destinies, cancelling EPP game text with<br>
4-LOM, IG-88 allowing you to draw an extra battle destiny, and Crossfire to add 5 to your total power, you'd hate to see the look on your opponents face.  In the air, well not exactly the same story.  Crossfire cancels S-Foils, Executor, Avenger with Captain Needa aboard it, several Bounty Hunter ships, and 2 Dreadnoughts should be enough to take out most starship combinations you might come across with this deck.<br>
<br>
If you are against...<br>
Hidden Base: Start with Security Precautions and flip your objective asap.  Drain at some Docking Bays for 3 each and Kashyyyk for 2 to get underneath your opponents skin and force him to flip his objective to cancel your drains.  Use Crossfire to cancel your opponents S-Foils and help you hold the Kashyyyk system.  As soon as he flips his objective, you basically have won the game.  Use the Death Star to transport Executor cause Executor can't fly that far and start probing systems, start with the ones that don't give you any presence.  Use the probe droids to let you retreive one force for probing the systems.  On the ground, he should be no problem, I mean, what chance do Obi-Wan an EPP or two, one that has cancelled game text, stand against this army of troops?<br>
<br>
EBO: Start with Imperial Decree and get your starfleet assembled asap.	Go after your opponent in space for as long as it takes for either you or your opponent to get wiped out.  If your starfleet dies, go to Hoth and crash their party with some walkers and killer characters.  Another game won.<br>
<br>
Massassi Base Ops: Start with Crossfire and get some ground to Yavin 4 before he does.	You might want to occupy the HQ cause he gets -4 on his Attack Run if you occupy it.  HQ is also an exterior site so you can put walkers there.  If he deploys Death Star, convert it.	He's probably going to have a good starfleet so keep your starfleet together.<br>
<br>
Profit:  Start with Imperial Decree and set your walkers course for Tatooine.  Deploy the AT-ATs on the side of the Tatooine:Desert closest to JP.  Whatever you do, kill Han, you can't afford to let him live, chop him up to pieces with the lightsabers and they should have no problem losing the game.<br>
<br>
RTP:  Start with Crossfire to help you kill Leia.  Put a walker at the DS:Docking Bay to trample 8D8.  If they use I'm Here To Rescue You, use This Is Some Rescue! to screw them up.	Make sure Leia doesn't make it to the War Room alive, use your walkers to ambush her at the Docking Bays.<br>
<br>
MWYHL:	Start with Broken Concentration and flip your objective asap and drain the hell out of them.<br>
<br>
Operatives: Go after whatever seems to be causing trouble, especially small stuff.<br>
<br>
Force Choke: Start with IAO so you can generate some extra force from the docking bays.  Wait till he has a few Revos on table to use Evader.  Deploy the AT-STs that have permanent pilots first to kill those annoying Nhdjs.<br>
<br>
Numbers: Start with IAO so you have less of a chance of drawing 0 on Odds.  Get Vesden aboard a starship asap.	Use Trample to crush the droids that are normally in a Numbers deck.  Deploy only your destiny two and up characters, no Vader, no Tarkin. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
