<br>
******* update 2 ******* thx all for da reviews but hidden wepaons sucks a dest of 2??? i just want to battle once with the fettand then beta down!AND I DON&#146;T PLAY &#148;Projective Telepathy” I&#146;VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA SINCE SOME GUYS TOLD ME IT WAS ERRATED SO PLZ NO REVIEWS FOR &#148;Projective Telepathy” 1<br>
<br>
<br>
this deck got the 3rd place at the ralltir regional this year in germany.<br>
<br>
the strat is very easy to understand, give ”direct damage” aka force drains (but this time direct from the reserve deck).<br>
i prefer to start with ”power of the hutt” (a biest effect), so i got out all the important aliens to protect my chamber<br>
like ephant mon and boelo, with the audience chamber i pull out Mosep or Gailid this is just a ”Tech Team” i prefer to deploy mosep<br>
from reserve deck and to pick up gailid (then he deploys for free) jabba is also a alternative alien, but this deck is fast<br>
and gailid with mosep makes it faster. i pull out some locations like holotable (with masterful move) the bridge (with we must accelerate <br>
our plans) and jabba’s palace i try to pick (maybe play ”Neimoidian Advisor” to get out jabba’s palace and so the lower passages)<br>
now i’m gonna activate 14 force from my, and maybe 4 from the opponent so 18 force will be more then enough for my cheap ”sweet”<br>
bounty hunters. the race is just to give more direct damage and to retrieve a little bit, but the main fact are the battles with =<br>
<br>
scum (tech) + first strike (houjix killer or help me obi ... or run luke ...) + jabba’s through with you (damn a dest of 5 for such a <br>
biest interrupt, hmm it used?cool) + colo claw fish (for the real beat down) + Blast Door Controls (kick all da barriers and escapes*g*)<br>
<br>
nobody will stop the battle with this combo just one dengar with gun and new ref 3 boba will kick asses, you gonna draw 4<br>
dests shoot 2 times and give ”direct damage” i forgot you gonna retrieve 3 force make you opponent lose force and for less then<br>
10 force! so what? <br>
<br>
the most important fact is to hide your power, don’t pull out colo claw fish before you gonna beat down or battle!<br>
you ask why? today there are many ”Colo Claw Fish Cancler” out their, because this card is tech, so wait with Blast Door Controls<br>
and Colo Claw Fish till you battle, also take care for ”aim high” deploy not too much characters just 1 bounty hunter and <br>
one ”normal character” (like onda baba & dr.evazan or jade), if you care this few points you will kick ben,luke etc.....<br>
<br>
against republic characters it’s hard i knew, but i think ghhk, barrier and boelo with mon and jabba in the hall with protect<br>
you from a beatdown.the main fact is also that you don’t concentrate your power to the opponent why? you will retrieve 6 force with the race<br>
give draisn with mosep and gailid.and your objective will also give some damage!<br>
<br>
maybe pull in guri with ship or some other b. ship cause HBX will make it hard but i think it isn’t very hard to probe the base,<br>
just go out with zuckuss in space and protect his a.ss from x-cannons.bossk in ship is a capital so he will be alive with a passanger like<br>
ponda baba & dr.evazan, just try it.<br>
<br>
and now one totaly new idea !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
==============================================================================================================================================================<br>
*************************************************** read this amazing idea (thx alex for the genial style) ***************************************************<br>
==============================================================================================================================================================<br>
<br>
if you want to retrieve the 3 force with scum + first strike witout a battle damage look thru this idea.<br>
<br>
example :<br>
<br>
you have 12 force open so deploy boba fett (not ref 3) for 4, deploy dengar for 4 now you have 4 force open,battle pay 3 force for the force<br>
retrieval so no you have got no more force, and at this point you play a ”just action” the tech interrupt ”Projective Telepathy”<br>
<br>
... OR A ”PLAYER” who just initiated a battle or force drain must use 2 force or it is cancled.<br>
<br>
hmm no force for you and the battle is canceld, its nice or?? next turn you’ll have enough things to proetct your a.ss like<br>
ghhk or jabba’s through with you,just try it and tell me if it still works???<br>
<br>
so this was my deck that i played at the raltiir regionals 2002, and i got the 3rd place and qualified my a.ss for the <br>
world champions*g* cause b.winkelhaus won the tournament and so the 2nd and 3rd place goes also, it’s really nice for me!<br>
(check my tour. report called ”Mainz  19.05.2002 Regional Raltiir Tournament-Germany-Switzerland-Austria”)<br>
<br>
<br>
thx all for reading and rating this deck, and plz tell me your awesome ideas!<br>
