No one was prepared for scanning crews and the deck did wonderfully.  RIGHT after that tournament I developed it's second option, for tournaments I felt would be prepared with shocks.	The deck starts off with a classic immune to revo start, ideally scan and drain early, gaining an advantage.  Sooner or later they catch up, but the deck is meant to be too powerful to stop once you have that card advantage.  When not playing the scan, the deck has cards that help fight off the rebels.  Against hidden base, you twilek for SecPrecs as soon as possible and go probing, the 4 ships generally does the trick.  You can often spread and drain against HB easily as well.  The deck generates enough force to have a healthy ability to fight revo decks, and normally the revo decks are so concerned about revo, they don't have the power (even in EPP's) to fight the walkers and DS power.  YaB helps against those EPP's in metagame 2 option, while the scans do wonders against the EPP's in metagame 1 (revo decks are rarely prepared with shocks).  LS ops can be trouble, the idea there is that you get your ships to his ops planet and use Battle Order.  Those rebels won't escape us (one in the deck, a second if using metagame 2 option) will help clear off landing claw.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
