They also have to get their sites out fast to start the fight before you flip.<br>
<br>
I usually start with Bad feeling unless I know what deck thay are playing. Sometimes I will start with Arrest order or battle plan but not often. I've been meaning to put in search and destroy to bring numbers and hidden base to me but I've been lazy.<br>
<br>
Basically, you just want to flip and use your other cards to go beat them up. I have won in space versus hidden base before so just kick them off and hold the locations where they can possible drain.<br>
<br>
Against numbers, put vesden at the docking bay or med. chamber but do not let him die. He is your only protection. Get him out quick, then let the numbers come up.<br>
<br>
Other than that, this deck rocks, just flip and destroy them where they are playing and save force to react with the chickenwalkers.<br>
<br>
By the way, I have to add something. This deck does not really need a Crush the Rebellion, because most of my characters either go up and fight in space or are INSIDE a vehicle and thus cannot be clashed. That card does not really worry me because I don't see it much and I usually can take care of it when somebody uses it.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
