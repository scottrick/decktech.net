Even WYS.  The major force drains and direct damage hurts alot.  Heres some card info about card selections.<br>
<br>
Imbalance:  Doing damage is better than making them pay.. well at least in my view<br>
<br>
Monnok:  With the tracking masterfuls you can get the monnok before making an attack or against a swarm deck.<br>
<br>
Battle Deployment:  Kills WYS and about every multiple destiny deck out there.  If i had walkers would make this even more powerful.  Plus not alot of people play LS capital ships.<br>
<br>
Everything else looks standard to me if you have any card selections d-mail me ill reply asap.<br>
<br>
vs. mode<br>
<br>
vs.  EBO<br>
I dunno how you play it but my 6 ships have owned most EBO decks out there.  Use search and destroy to help you with direct damage and get vader out early.  Fast drains help.  If they give you luke i would just suck the 1 damage a turn and keep Vader with stick going and Emp Janus.  Pick your battles in space.  Try not to get beat down that bad.  For more tactics you can read my TR against mike mendoza.<br>
<br>
vs HB flip<br>
Hold security precautions till they flip then go for 1 turn probe.  Search and destroy helps alot again dont go back and duel this time and just stay on battlegrounds for drains.  If you get enough cards stacked on Insg Rebellion then go try to cross him.  Watch out for beatdown again.  If they are playing swarm use monnok.<br>
<br>
vs HB mains<br>
Go back and duel them for damage every turn.  Play Presence on Throne Room for a max drain for 3.  Occupy Endor if they play it and go to your endor dbay to max out your drains.  Use imbalance for Off/ON combo or OMDH.  Monnok again helps alot maybe you can get some mains with it. <br>
<br>
vs Training<br>
Get as much damage as fast as you can.  When jedi test 1 completes then go back and try to duel.  get presence out and go to Rendilli and CC dbay to drain and occupy for 3 battlegrounds.  After they finish Test 5 hold a barrier for Leia who might come down and try to add destiny and kill her next turn.  <br>
<br>
vs WYS <br>
Hardest matchup of all if they are playing it right.  Battle deployment is your best ally.  With that going and a few guys on Tat you will have no problem controling Cantina and or Dbay.  If they play the Generic Dbay play No Escape for Generation and beatdown if they deploy there.  Try to kill them off Kessel.  With the right guys on tat search and destroy can work.  Watch out for Artoo threepio conbo with no destiny.  Killing off characters with force lightning and sniper is the best way to beat this deck.<br>
<br>
vs TIGIH<br>
Dont duel unless you are tracked right.  Play some ships and Rendilli.  Drain and try not to lose many battles.  Go the Chirpas Hut for a high drain.  Convert their Endor Dbay so they have to pay more force to move around.  Dont let them get a huge drain going at Back Door with Midge.  If you dont make stupid mistakes this is an easy matchup.  <br>
<br>
Well thats all I can think off right now d-mail me if any questions.  All you need is 6 ships and a lateral to beat space!!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
