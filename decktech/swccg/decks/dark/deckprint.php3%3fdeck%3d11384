It will be more expected now, so a couple more visages might be needed (but I can&#146;t find space).  Black pilots are 8/9 starting talon roll.  So they can go straight up against the super-falcon or lateral damage, dark manuevers, dreadnaughts, battle deployment are used to pump up that talon roll number.  If you control space - the drains get outrageous.	This deck will never lose to a super-falcon deck.  Why no No Escape? Cause I am no weinnie - and I will have three battlegrounds - plus Honor will be rarely played.  As for the other matchups:<br>
<br>
Profit - start mara, dengar, and load up the AC as fast as you can.  Do not pull the DS docking bay.  That way they are either coming to AC or space.  Since profit is weak in space typically (no han) I will take my chance there.  The key to beating profit is to never give up the AC.  If they release Han - drain for 3/4 there with the sabers.<br>
<br>
HB - visage puts pressure on them.  Just drain at the DS docking bay with sabers.  If you are lucky enough to draw the defensive perimeter - go there.	Lord Vader there is sick with the plus 4 to destiny on the saber.  Otherwise, talon roll their ships - they can only have 1 gold squadron, and it will hit the table fast generally with general cal.  So let them have that drain.  Wedge in ship is tough but not unstoppable.  You should try and setup pride of the empire here for a game ender.<br>
<br>
EBO - Even tougher as you will notice no Decree.  If this is a problem - switch decree for CHYBC.  But I prefer CHYBC as is hurts retrieval - the bane of visage.  Same thing goes - wait to deploy space until they have spread to one area where talon roll makes them very weak.  Perhaps the falcon and some scrub ship.  You will have to win this one by hurting their space, since their drains will be big.<br>
<br>
That is all the LS plays - everything should be fine.  This deck has it all - huge space drains, stong concentrated ground force.  Surprise. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
