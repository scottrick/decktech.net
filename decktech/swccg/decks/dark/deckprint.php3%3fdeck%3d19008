<br>
Start with Ice Plains, and using Prepared Defenses, get No Escape (so that non your direct damage will not be reduced by Honor of the Jedi), Imperial Arrest Order &amp; Secret Plans (to get my docking bays out of my deck and deployed as soon as possible and also to get those zeros out of the deck and the +1 to the Imperials of ability&lt;3 is nice for i have quite a few in my deck), and Combat Response (for the Tie Defenders). <br>
<br>
First thing is get your sites out as soon as possible and get You May Start Your Landing out on the table.  If you didn&#146;t draw any of the non-docking bays in you hand, the Nemondian Advisor is in there to help you get the Hoth system out or the 3rd marker out (if you haven&#146;t got You May Start Your Landing out yet). If you didn&#146;t get You May Start Your Landing in your hand, Twi&#146;lek Advisors are they to help get it out on the table. You may wondering why I didn&#146;t start with You May Start Your Landing using Twi&#146;lek Advisor, well, i feeling that i need to get more of sites out as soon as possible so i can start generating alot so i could get my AT-AT&#146;s out and Starships as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
By the next couple of turns,you should have at least one of your Hoth sites controled with an AT-AT and occupy or control Hoth system in the next couple of turns. By that time, your opponate will start to feel the ping of You May Start Your Landing.  And if you have We&#146;re In Attack Position Now out and at least a commander or general out, they will feel the ping there too.<br>
<br>
By mid-game, you have at almost, if not all your sites out.  You should start trying to control two more Hoth sites, setting up your Walker Garrison big Drain. You should have at least one in your hand from drawing it using You May Start your Landing. If Great Warrior is out or Menace Fades, just drain for the most that you can and let the direct damage do its thing.<br>
<br>
Battling:<br>
The AT-ATs have quite bit of power on its own, and there are plenty of pilots to boost it up.  If you get a Commander or General out, suggest let them being the pilot, this way it will protect them from lightsabers and most weapons. <br>
Trample is a great card to get rid of undercover spies and any other character at any time.  And use Ice Storm to get rid of big characters like luke and qui-gon, while you hide your characters inside your AT-AT. In Space, mass group in orbit around Hoth, this way your ground troops will have lots of extra power (if you control it) and so you could use We&#146;re In Attack Positions. <br>
<br>
This deck is far from tournment worthy in my opinion, but i think i would be a fun deck to play outside of tournment play, but one day it might be though.  I appreciate any help that you could give. <br>
