<br>
play emperor first turn to a bg DB, hopefully you&#8217;ll have janus or someone, then when you&#8217;re ready, put vader at the same location. if they&#8217;re an idiot, they&#8217;ll follow up with luke, crossing over, however, you play Wookie, returning him to hand. the rest of the play is basically using Wookie each turn to make them hurt from your destiny. as soon as they play luke, theyre locked in cause you have to deploy him to the same location. the Sith Probe Droids arent an engine or anything, just letting you retrieve a Wookie or some other thing at a crucial point, same with No Escape. the rest is covered through stalling battles, and using First Strike. after 3-4 turns of Your Destiny, you should have the advantage. this deck is still in formative stages, and id prefer some REAL advice, as opposed to kids giving it 1 star cause it doesnt have troopers or some crap. this deck kills those kids, because it surprises idiots who think they know how to kill certain decks like BHBM by giving them luke, and picking the activation with swindle.<br>
<br>
card choices:<br>
you swindled me!: this card is PERFECT for this deck, cause it runs on a lot of lost cards, but also a large amount of force. play during opponents turn when you have no force pile, and something good like a probe droid lost, and they&#8217;ll think &#8217;ho ho ho, activate&#8217;. and then you bounce luke back, and they&#8217;ll wish they retrieved that one force.<br>
<br>
knowledge & defense: this is used in conjunction with the sense/uncertains during the opponents activate phase in order to trip it. first they activate with the insert, then you play uncertain to make them take a new hand, which will hopefully trip the insert. this way, its even more certain that you wont be beaten down upon. im thinkin of throwing in one or 2 more.<br>
<br>
FOIL force lightning: if you dont have 2 foil force lightning, you&#8217;d better give up, cause this deck FAILS without em. and remember to tilt them in the light so you blind your opponent. use in conjunction with choke vader to whup a55holes like quigon.<br>
<br>
projective tele: odds are that the opponent will capitalize on the few characters in the deck to launch massive EPP beatdowns. projective gets those phuckers every time.<br>
<br>
sith probe droid: deploy from reserve to retrieve a card. not bad. use it judiciously, not just any old how. if you have the opportunity, retrieve it using first strike or no escape. thinkin bout probe telemetry as well.<br>
<br>
voyeur: usually comes in pairs, and i think i should put in one more if i continue with it, or stop it altogether. its a quick fix of 1 or 2 force damage instantly. it will prolly go out for another insert, or a limited res, which i think will be more useful.<br>
<br>
3x janus: the quick setup is essential. search force lightning, then janus for instant card advantage. also applies pressure with the drains.<br>
<br>
i was thinking of taking this to an AOTBS architecture, but i decided on BHBM for the speed emperor and Your Destiny. if you have questions, dmail me before reviewing, and if you do review, keep in mind this is a prototype. if you build it, tell me how it fares against standard deck archetypes, but only if you&#8217;re a good player who kicks a55.<br>
<br>
thanks for your considered opinion. cheers.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
