At my last tournament, I remember having a conversation about how SAC was dead and then altering a Savrip the next round. It&#146;s not a matter of how nasty the hoser is, it&#146;s a matter of if people run it or not. If people were unwilling to give up two card slots for SAC protection, I&#146;m sure we&#146;ll see a few players unwilling to give up even one if they think it&#146;s dead. Besides, the combo cards mean they at least aren&#146;t complete wastes of space in my deck. I plan to cycle these with a few other cards (including Fighter Coming In and another SFS) every few tournaments to keep people on their toes =).<br>
	You can grab Wakeelmui, the Emporer&#146;s Power, a Docking Bay, and the Big E himself right away. The Endor Docking Bay is your token battleground site to stick Vader if your opponent doesn&#146;t give you one. You probably shouldn&#146;t play the D*2 DB unless you really need activation (you shouldn&#146;t) or you&#146;re ready to bring Luke to meet his new master.<br>
	I&#146;ve played this deck since D*2 came out, and with the TIEs retreiving you can lose force to add destiny in pretty much every battle. Usually, it&#146;s a matter of losing one force to make your opponent lose one DESTINY of force.<br>
	Ground might seem weak, but you don&#146;t need to hold territory. Mara is almost as good as Vader with Palpatine out. Pick your ground battles and you&#146;ll do ok--the space drains with a few beatdowns when they need to spread. You might put Vader down early on to the docking bay and want him elsewhere, but that&#146;s what R,MF is for. is what wins against ground decks.<br>
vs. EBO/HB<br>
	Against dedicated space decks, your best bet is to stick Vader at the DB and let Your Destiny rack up damage. They have to spread to drain, so when they do you can bring the TIEs down. You may need to use Uncertain is the Future to cycle your hand to get a good attack force. Remember to SAC things if they have no protection. Most of these decks have an AO, and remember at least part of that AO can benefit you.<br>
	EBO is a bit harder because you have time against HB before they start draining. EBO presents you with a dilemma: Do you stick Vader at the Landing Platform, or at the Hoth Outermost Marker? Be warned that you&#146;re likely to get an icestorm if he&#146;s there, and if he moves under the shield Your Destiny doesn&#146;t work. You might want to wait and see where your opponent commits Luke before you stick down Vader.<br>
	Battle Order hurts both decks, and if Vader and Mara can defeat whatever guys they have on the ground, you can control two Hoth sites and use Decree to cancel their drain advantage.<br>
vs. There is Good in Him<br>
	However wins the most battles will win this game. You should have an advantage in space. Since Luke is already out at the start, you don&#146;t have to throw down Vader to his site if you don&#146;t want to; but if it&#146;s the Jedi Knight (not the Rebel Scout) you might grab him early and keep battling with Vader around, but only if your opponent hasn&#146;t won enough battles to have a chance to turn Vader. You have an advantage, here, simply because the LS player needs to get an even higher draw than you and if/when you go to the Throne Room Palpatine makes it even harder.<br>
vs. The new EU thing<br>
	Well, this objective is brand-spanking new, so I haven&#146;t played any decks that used it. If they&#146;re Kessel Running, just kill their freighters, and use the cannons to make ships with good abilities lost. If they aren&#146;t, then just battle and retrieve. Most of this decks probably have some space element, so you can win your battles there even if Vader gets stuck at the Throne Room with the Rebel Scout.<br>
vs. Agents in the Court<br>
	Eloms would probably present the toughest match. You can put a Vader down to make them lose force early, you&#146;re better off attacking after they&#146;ve spread, especially if they don&#146;t have enough characters at each site to draw destiny after DVDLOTs chokes one =). Your Space drains might not do much at first because they can block them early on, but when things wear on they&#146;ll possibly become the deciding factor.<br>
vs. Mains and Toys<br>
	Vader nullifies Luke, and can probably choke Chewie (or even Han, sometimes, when he&#146;s not around). A big fight might end up taking place in the Throne Room, but the space drains and TIE retrieval will add up in your favor.<br>
	Finally, I&#146;m just going to add that I&#146;m hoping to attend a big tournament at a con this year and was wondering if anyone knew when and where they are. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
