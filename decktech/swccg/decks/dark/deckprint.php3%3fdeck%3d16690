<br>
get my two sites before I activate, and<br>
drop ychf for s&d. activate deploy locations,<br>
get cc with objective. draw.<br>
<br>
2nd turn deploy my characters. get the east<br>
platform if I need it, or have the force to<br>
deploy there. dark deal is now in play,as I<br>
get that from my objective on this turn.<br>
insert disturbance in the force.<br>
and if the draw was really good maybe occupation<br>
this turn, or the turn after,etc. deploy<br>
s&d, deploy the AO if drawn, or if piett&#8217;s<br>
on the table and I have a comm.or gen. deployed<br>
as well.<br>
<br>
Alright opponents 2nd turn<br>
they activate 1, trooper sabacc<br>
they activate 1, cc sabacc<br>
they activate 1, uncertain is the future.<br>
<br>
now by design through all that action the insert<br>
popped and they have no force. because when<br>
that happens essentially their turn is over.<br>
<br>
and then on your next turn dd does its damage.<br>
<br>
this deck is about damage, DD, occupation, s&d<br>
and AO. it&#8217;s alot real fast.<br>
<br>
and this deck worked at dpc(not every game.)<br>
just like described above, sabacc, my opponent<br>
activated his 2nd force and pop. his turn<br>
ended, and on my turn I had free drain of 10!<br>
<br>
his turn he got 1 character on cc, I kissed the<br>
other one, and then on my turn I beat down that<br>
character with my extra characters in hand.<br>
<br>
this version is not as fast as Hawkin&#8217;s version<br>
but I like it a little better For being versatile<br>
enough to battle and I have cc sabacc for a little<br>
retrieval as well as trigger the disturbance. and I will probably do some<br>
extra tweeking with it, more ships, and get<br>
xizor in here, cause he&#8217;s BUFF!<br>
