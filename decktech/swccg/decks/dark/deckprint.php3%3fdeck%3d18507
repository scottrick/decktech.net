Well Guarded </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The new You Cannot Hide Forever &amp; Mobilization Points combo effect really sets this deck into motion. First off, it can pull the Executor and then be sent to the Lost Pile to obtain Flagship Operations.<br>
<br>
However, do not do this too early. I made this mistake and my opponent played Sense &amp; Recoil In Fear and cycled our hands. That really hurt. So, wait until you ready to deploy Flagship Operations BEFORE you pull them out.<br>
<br>
As for sites, it&#146;s really not that difficult unless you are REALLY unlucky. Admiral Piett can pull Commander Gherant (Gherant can pull Executor sites), and Imperial Arrest Order can pull at least the Executor: Docking Bay. Be sure to put someone at the docking bay so no one can move there (swap a card out for Ephant Mon so that spies may not even deploy there, if this is a problem for you). Once the Executor and Flagship Operations are deployed, your TIEs are now deploy 1, destiny 4 (5 if battle destiny), and forfeit 5!<br>
<br>
Even in the event that Flagship Operations is never really completed, this deck has the firepower to hold its own. All Power To Weapons makes your TIEs immune to attrition (and power +2) and each of your TIEs may fire their weapons TWICE per battle (if you have the force, you can send two opposing starfighters to the Lost Pile for every armed TIE Interceptor).<br>
<br>
This is where Fighter Cover really shines (Admiral Piett can pull this if you end up with Gherant in your hand). Even if you don&#146;t have the force, fire your TIE weapons using the zero-force option to make them power +3 (and redraw one if you don&#146;t like it). It is crucial that you do not forget the ending part of this card. If the opposing player uses sites at a system you have out (or puts his or her own out), your characters with immunity to attrition are way buffer. If you have Lord Vader, use him instead of DVDLOTS because with Fighter Cover, he would be immune to attrition &lt; 8 and add 2 to EACH lightsaber destiny draw. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
