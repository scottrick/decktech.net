There&#146;ll Be Hell To Pay </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">FIRST I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING: the objective of the deck is NOT to blow up planets. It is not to flip. I&#146;ve seen soem of the reviews on other Branguses, and want to clarify that RIGHT NOW. thanks.<br>
 Also! this is not a rip off. I saw some branguses at the DPC and on here, but did not copy them. You will find that many things seem to be Must Haves in brangus, just like in a HB with matching pilots, you will probably use general calrissian and the falcon<br>
<br>
Ok, the deck plays pretty much like any other Brangus. However, there are a few things I didn&#146;t like, and didn&#146;t feel were as good as people think.<br>
<br>
If you don&#146;t know how a brangus deck works, please go to decipher and read the cards before you review. Thanks.<br>
<br>
First, most people were running the &#146;shaft&#146;...aka hoth war room/roc/much anger in him. I think it is too easy for a good player to get around this today, and is too dificult to set up, while there are other single cards that are more useful. The key to brangu is single cards, as his ability only retrieves 1 card. It cannot retrieve combos. So if somebody On The Edge suicides their &#146;shaftee&#146;, you cann&#146;t get the combo back.<br>
<br>
You may have noticed the numbered cards on the list. I am going to follow the numbers and explain why they are in the deck. all or most of these are NOT in other decks, so I feel some explanation is needed.<br>
<br>
(1)P-59: awesome, direct force loss, destiny, immunity - what more could you want in a beat down character?<br>
<br>
(2)Delak the Black: singlehandedly can kill the senate. just keep getting him back.<br>
<br>
(3)Gardula:had to stack a maul on the racer? when you win, get him into your hand.<br>
<br>
(4)sith infiltrator: IMHO, the BEST DS ship ever. it can go anywhere, it can avaoid battle, it can probe...against hidden baase it WILL win you games. and its a 6!<br>
<br>
(5)holotable: more activation, plus it gives you a place to force drain<br>
<br>
(6)holonet transmission: The deck arguably needs another, but no room. It will protect from the OOC combo, it will save the holotable, it can pull the vader you just got for destiny into hand...its awesome<br>
<br>
(7)Masterful Move/Endor Occupation: its a lower destiny, but the ability to kill celebration should help against a number of popular decks.<br>
<br>
(8)Shut Him Up or Shut Him Down: kills bacta tank. bacta tank will lose you games. its a 6. nuf said<br>
<br>
(9)fear: so its a 1 for 1 trade, sometimes a 1 for 2 trade. But you can get it back every turn, and they can&#146;t. Free force loss early.<br>
<br>
(10)Voyer: this was my replacement for another grabber, as they aren&#146;t always free. If your opponent is playing a bunch of used interrupts, wait then use it to kill off some, then pull it back. Rinse, repeat.<br>
<br>
(11)Secret Plans/IAO:stops nabrun. stops retrieval.<br>
<br>
(12)Do They Have A Code Claerance?:better than SSPFT, as it removes (effectively) the same cards from the game, but hurts all future retrieval as well.<br>
<br>
(13)First Stike/Battle Order: I opted for the combo version, as while the retrieval and damage from first strike is nice, you need battle order to slow down drain decks, such as EBO, so you can get your hit squads in there.<br>
<br>
(14)Security Precautions: more direct damage. The deck really needs 2x Its Worse combo, but again, no room. If a problem for you, make room. Also, +1 activate, and makes maul in ship immune to HB.<br>
<br>
(15)reactor Terminal: as all of your retrieval is into hand from brangus, you will need a way at the end of the game to increase diff. Also helps tracking early.<br>
<br>
Matchups are pretty much the same as all branguses, but you do have an advantage vs. HB. Just use hit squads, then after the race stick the emperor and Janus at the podrace arena to drain for 2 a turn. Use your interrupts for direct damage. Weak against OOC, some profit, RTP if they flip, grabbers. strong against M+T, RST, senate, HB (some), ground, etc.<br>
<br>
thanks and enjoy<br>
