Nevar Yalnal is for blount or corran horn. Also, the objective is even easier to flip b/c of the rebel base locations.merrejk will pull the systems. now for the match-ups:<br>
WYS:<br>
the decree+ -1 drain w/ ISBs will stop the AO db drains and imperial supply can be used against  <br>
the beggar varient. tarkin cancels the fallen portals. stay consolidated and drain at your dbs and their cantina. grabbers + imbalance will kill retrieval. guri=money<br>
EBO: <br>
the dbs will be useless here so you must take over there hoth sites. use walkers + control to stop ice storm and set up decree.watch out for swarms don&#8217;t deploy kashyyk and drain on the ground. it&#8217;ll be slow but the agent retrieval should pull you through.<br>
HIDDEN MAINS:<br>
start TINTOE instead of decree keep your guys together and drain quick at the dbs. grab their retrievers or cyclers and keep vader and tarkin in hand until they come after you and 4-lom can be vital when he cancels EPP text or helps piss off Jedi Luke.the walkers keep the forfeit rich agents safe from weapons and surprise assault.and play your game not theirs<br>
TIGIH/scouts:<br>
haven&#8217;t had much experience against this deck type so only general tips here. grab luke to hurt their activation then run to the safety of your dbs then give him to vader asap. decree will stop midge and sabers while 5d6 sitting on endor will slow their drains completely. when they come to you track for trample and divide and conquer with vader and tarkin.<br>
<br>
try this deck feel free to alter it as appropriate and give us some feed back. ISB is one of the few decks these days that is&#8217;nt meta&#8217;d against and can still surprise players in these days of Vader decks and scummy swarms<br>
