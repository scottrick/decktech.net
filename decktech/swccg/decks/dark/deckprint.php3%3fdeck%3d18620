Oh yeah got a reply to not enough ships, that&#8217;s about as many ships as I&#8217;ve always played in my decks except in my DPC deck where i played with only 1, cause HB is never a problem cause no one here plays it so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Update: Damn that&#8217;s true can&#8217;t start drop ah well switch it up for the grabber<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing don&#8217;t take this deck as a super serious type thing, unless i changed this a bit I wouldn&#8217;t play it in a tournament, but this was built using extra cards not in my main decks so. I was going to use the Utinni tech Jawa but i wasn&#8217;t about to look through my crap for utinnis<br>
<br>
<br>
First you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8221;You are playing with Jawa&#8217;s because...?&#8221;<br>
<br>
Well I was looking through my commons took notice of one of them, Power +1 reduce force drains, got me thinking. But it came to the whole jawa problem the stupid deploy so i check the CRD STG or whatever they call it now look for jawa, modifiable values n stuff find nothing ask on the BBS someone said they are reduced by Jabba Scum n stuff so I figured why not.<br>
<br>
You&#8217;re now thinking &#8221;The Camp will own this&#8221;<br>
Well when i see someone here play the camp i guess they&#8217;ll own me until then...<br>
<br>
Ok so Character choices<br>
4-LOM With Concussion Rifle  <br>
This guy is the EPP Killer<br>
<br>
Arica<br>
Corran Horn may hurt her but, she&#8217;s can be a life saver in the first couple games in a tournament if you come up against a scrub with the hyperdrive obj<br>
<br>
Aurra Sing  <br>
She&#8217;s the next Djas Phur cept she&#8217;s better and steals dead people&#8217;s sabers<br>
<br>
Bib Fortuna  <br>
This is a MKOS deck him and Jabba make your destinies +2 and he gets pulled with POTH<br>
<br>
Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle  <br>
Duh!<br>
<br>
Boelo<br>
Jabba&#8217;s Tarkin.. who gets pulled w/ POTH  <br>
<br>
Chall Bekan  <br>
Obvious<br>
<br>

<br>
Dengar With Blaster Carbine  <br>

<br>
Dr. Evazan & *Ponda Baba  <br>
cheap deploy good power.. well most of the time<br>
<br>
Ephant Mon<br>
lifesaver<br>
  <br>
Gardulla The Hutt  <br>
some retrieval.. unless they want to track 1s and 2s<br>
<br>
IG-88 With Riot Gun  <br>
he&#8217;s iggy<br>
<br>
2 Jabba<br>
 Adds forefit to the Jawas and makes them deploy nice and free<br>
  <br>
5 Jawa (EP1) <br>
Power 2 and reduce force drains<br>
<br>
1 Mercenary Pilot <br>
Him + Barge= gold<br>
<br>
1 Nebit<br>
Dude&#8217;s a destiny adder and subtracter  <br>
<br>
1 P-59<br>
he shoots stuff  <br>
<br>
1 Prince Xizor <br>
his text can be useful <br>
<br>
1 U-3PO (Yoo-Threepio)  <br>
Another spy cept Corran won&#8217;t hurt you that bad..cause no beatdown<br>
<br>
3 Wittin  <br>
My Rep.. makes the jawas power 4.. nice bonus<br>
<br>
How you play it<br>
<br>
Turn 1 non profit<br>
Grab AC.. if available grab Hutt Influence otherwise grab Empant or Bib. Now if you&#8217;re getting good activation this first turn start setting up your AC with Jabba or Chell and posse. otherwise draw up a couple.<br>
<br>
Turn 2<br>
You&#8217;re getting atleast 7 force this turn so now you can set up how you see fit.<br>
<br>
Turn 1 against profit<br>
Start Jabba and Chall at the AC (grab the Engineer) Now usually I&#8217;ll use AC as my starting JP site and convert it to lower their first turn activation and deploy someone -2 from reserve deck to shore up your force there. If you can flip this turn or next with the hand you have grab bib with POTH if you can&#8217;t grab emphant.<br>
<br>
More Card Choices<br>
the podracer.. people are getting arrogant not putting as much podrace interrupts so you never know every now and then you may be able to pull something off<br>
<br>
The Barge<br>
Pulls a Twix site.. makes my guys deploy cheaper POTH makes people on it immune to att <6 ect ect<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
If you have a question about the deck as to what why? or why not, contact me by AIM (COTEB1) or Dmail or something before you review it just so you can be sure as to what the deck is supposed to do before you give me a review.<br>
<br>
 Thanks for takin a look<br>
