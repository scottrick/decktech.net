Alter x1 -So good for this deck<br>
Bubo<br>
Vader's Saber<br>
Battle Order<br>
Trample<br>
Empire's New Order<br>
Imperial Barrier<br>
Those Rebels won't Escape Us<br>
The idea is of course a non-flip Endor Ops using the 2 starting locations to allow for hefty drains at systems that already give you high drains. Throw in Chiraneu aboard a SD and you just add more force to be lost. Thus the amount of Star Destroyers.<br>
Revolution is not dead but in the even of it's use on the bunker, I pack 3 spies for a reason.<br>
As for starting, used prepared defenses to Start with IAO, Oppressive Enforcement and Cannot hide Forever always! Then send Hide to the lost pile before you activate to pull an effect, unless you sense a numbers or possibly have the effects in hand.<br>
Main Course is wicked against eloms which are huge right now. And if Han is paired up with one, dang you get double smackage! Let's not forget it also cancels a certain frozen card...<br>
Usually put out Perimeter Patrol however on the deck type, you may choose to pick another effect.<br>
Ephant Mon is of course a secure bunker with them being unable to deploy or move to the bunker the whole game. If you can get Merrijek to join him, you'll have no problem pulling those systems out and lowering the 0 destiny count in your deck.<br>
Your power will rely in space, I won't deny it but you're ground crew should hold thier own at a few sites. Now to the VS decks portion:<br>
<br>
Echo Base Ops: This deck will counter it and the space will be filled with starship debris. They will have actiavtion jump on you but that's why you amass the fleet. If it looks like they play with Hyper Escape, save Something special for them and drop a load of SD's to battle those puny ships. Then let's say they do move thier x-wing swarm away. Gravity Shadow and pick a little x-wing to return back to the system. (hey where'd everyone go? So alone) And the beating will commence. Your destiny in hear is average 2-4 so you shouldn't worry of failing a draw. Battle, drain, retrieve a little with First Strike if you're lucky enough to get it out. Utilize the AO in here to cause extra damage if you have Igar at the Endor DB and you Occupy the System. This game will be tight AND fun and with 2 lateral damage, you should still win!<br>
<br>
VS: I Can Save Him<br>
This is tough. You'll want to stop Luke's activation, and of course perimeter patrol will put a huge crimp in anyone coming to endor to save good ol' Jedi Luke. If Vader snags Luke, take them up to space and have the father and son sip tea in space. Don't lose battles. With your power and Endor control that should come easy. You will drain, they will try to fight. That's what this deck is supposed to do to. So if a couple of power cards like Main course (that ewok...) Have you Now and Lateral Damage chance along you lay a good smacketh down.<br>
<br>
VS: Ops<br>
You will outdrain them. Thier force will only give you more super power in space and then you can choose whenever to send a crew to the planet to battle. This will be a drain race and without the aid of Battle Order it'll be close but nothing can stop the Chiraneau Rumors.<br>
<br>
VS: MWYHL<br>
The loss of your bonus may hurt but you can set up at leat 1 hefty drain. The rest is to hold onto Endor via system and perimeter control. Lateral Damage kills most any Superfalcon. Heck you start out at parsec 8. If you want you could visit Yoda or just wait for them to come to you. Preferably if they aren't doing a tst 6 deck. You'll still have a leap on them.<br>
<br>
VS: HB<br>
Read my EBO strategy nothing changes except I encourage you to probe.<br>
<br>
VS: RTP<br>
Should be intersting but secret plans and something special will stall thier draining. Your drains will be even more crimpy to them and there's always the idea of just capturing Liea with iggy.<br>
<br>
VS: Profit<br>
Tight game but most profit does not see space. This is changing but it will be tough for them to keep up with your fleet and those space control cards. Be very wary of those dang Eloms. Race to the finish and use your space to gain the upper hand. You will make them hurt for using SAC<br>
and should they think it'll hurt you, well Oppressive Enforcement is good for so many reasons.<br>
<br>
VS: Vampires<br>
What the hell are you doing playing vampires? Drop your cards and get a friggin' wooden stake. Stupid people, do I have to tell you how to handle everything?</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
