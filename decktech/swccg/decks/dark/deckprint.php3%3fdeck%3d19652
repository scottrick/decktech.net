Early Game: First action of the game, if your opponent didn&#8217;t start with Don&#8217;t Do That Again: Search for Rendili if he play with the defensive shield he could only play it after your first action.<br>
You now activate 4 force + opponent force. Try to get Xizor on D*Db with Guri and a Vigo it&#8217;s always good and Emperor on an opponent site or on the blokade site or the Cor :Db with a Presence of the Force with Ig-88 or Jodo and a Vigo deploy Bad feeling and keep a  Projective Telepathy in hand.<br>
<br>
Mid Game: You know activate for 10 + opponent force.Track like a machine with the obj and wait for luke or the beatdown.  Keep your ship and Control & Set for Stun in hand for a beatdown in space.  Hidden weapon is for Qui qon and Luke JK.<br>
<br>
Late game  <br>
Drain, Damage, and win. If you lost the D*:Db you can retrive it with PASOA hehe.<<br>
<br>
Match up<br>
Vs all kind of space deck<br>
Don&#8217;t grap Rendili for your first action instead grab S&D with YISYW.  Flip early for a max of damage like with emperor, POTF and a vigo on Blokate site and Xizor and Guri on D*Db<br>
Sense key cards, Play Battle Order and Projective Telepathy, he will have to pay for his drain.<br>
Try to beatdown with Zukuss, 4-lom, Bossk, First Strike, track four 6 and a Set for stun.. it alway works. Emperor must choke the undercover Spy.<br>
<br>
Vs MWYHL<br>
 Don&#8217;t grap Rendili for your first action instead grab S&D with YISYW.  Flip early for a max of damage like with emperor, POTF and a vigo on Blockate site and Xizor and Guri on D*Db<br>
Sense key cards, Counter Anger Fear Agression with Projective Telepathy Track low for sense and prepare for beatdown with the defensive stuff.<br>
<br>
Vs WYS <br>
Really cool Match-up. He will have hard time with activation and you too.  Play Emperor on <br>
Cantina and move Xizor on Tat : Db.  Don&#8217;t Deploy Rendili and D*Db for choke him.  Dengar is the MAN for shotThe Bastard Smuggler. Bad Feeling I Have make luke hard to play... Late game: Beatdown in space.  You should win.<br>
<br>
Podrace: You can win the podrace personnaly I have win it 5 times and nerver lost it 2 vs a Podprofit and  3 vs 2 diferrent WYS Podrace.  The key is to start Allegation Of Corruption instead of Mob pointand sebulba podracer.  <br>
Vs WYS Podrace: First Turn you activate 7 force : you block him, draw a 3 if you have a sense and an emperor on table deploy emperor and sense if he play A Step Backward if not move Xizor on Cor db and Grab ASB.  Mid game try to flip his obj back to sense the others ASB and Track 6 to win the race and the game<br>
Vs Podprofit same thing except that you must expect that he will try to sense your sence.<br>
<br>
Vs Profit + Any deck without space<br>
Deploy Dengar and Jodo Kast, try to deploy Palpy ASAP and Bunker the Audience with him.  Xizor and guri stay at the d*db. Deploy Rendili first turn with a ship and Battle Order he can&#146;t pay 3 a turn to drain with his activation.  Battle Order will win the game<br>
<br>
Vs Quiet Mining<br>
Choke him, Deploy, Battle, Drain, Win .....<br>
<br>
New Main Duel <br>
I think you could try to capture the main with a 6 and ig-88 or with hidden weapon or win duel with emperor and 2x 6. Event if palpy can&#8217;t force drain he does direct damage.<br>
Sense : The first is never expect  by the opponent and force him to deploy defensive shield. Battle Order help a lot because he has to pay for his drain. And if you control a system with Zukass YCHFE is in action (if he play with Don&#146;t do that again) and if you have a tracked 6 on top of your  deck you can lightning the first Jedi that come in front of Palpy (defence value -1 with YCHFE)Track is the key in this match-up<br>
<br>
Hidden Weapon and 4-lom? : It &#8217;s deadly vs Luke JK and Quigon or any Jedi with immunity <br>
<br>
Why Mob. : For force opponent to deploy the defensive shield, and grap a planet first turn or S&D<br>
Cards I would like to add: <br>
Ghh&those rebel won&#8217;t escape us<br>
Evader monnok<br>
6x emperor palpatine<br>
We wish to board at once<br>
