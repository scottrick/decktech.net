The whole idea behind my deck is to podrace and and do a hunt down deck. For podracing this deck has a lot of good destinies to help you win the race. Also cards like &#8221;hit racer&#8221;, &#8221;Pit Crews&#8221; and &#8221;Watto&#8217;s Box&#8221; Greatly improve podracing for you. While you start you podrace on your first turn you are setting up hunt down. Once you get your sites deploy them as quickly as possible. Then get vader out. Your other characters go and control other sites (being carful with total power and what you can down if a battle occurs). Once you win your podrace you just retrieved eleven force while you opponent losses eleven. If a jedi goes down at a site be ready to duel (unless it is Qui Gon). Make sure you have the duel card with focused attack before you duel. how ever many sites the jedi is away dosen&#8217;t matter, just use your good, old buddy Elis Helrot.If they have Insurrection just do it in your move phase. If he is at in interrior site don&#8217;t worry about it because you objective dosen&#8217;t get flipped back to the front side. To Kill Qui Gon Just Elis your characters and make sure that Qui Gon cant get away without a battle that will desimate him.<br>
<br>
Here is what to do for these decks<br>
<br>
Any space deck: wait for the time until they suspect you have no starships and supprise attack them with you three starships and give them a lot of battle damage<br>
Hidden Base: deploy security percautions<br>
Watch Your Step (space): suprise battle<br>
EBO: Put Imperial Decree down and control the hoth sites to ignore the force drains<br>
<br>
Any retreval deck: secret plans and There&#8217;ll Be Hell To Pay their interrupt<br>
<br>
Any ground deck: over power them in battles with you mains<br>
Profit:Duel Obi and Luke and once han is released kill him and give your opponent a lot of battle damage.<br>
Watch Your Step (ground):go to the sites where you cannot be targeted by fallen portal (stick with the cantina and other sites)<br>
<br>
Mind What You Have Learned: Grab your sites, control them, and drain.<br>
