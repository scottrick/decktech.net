I think I&#146;ll start by quoting my own TR from last week where I explained my gripes with traditional Hunt Down:<br>
<br>
&quot;The first gripe was that some people were playing Ephant Mon and, more worryingly, Power Of The Hutt.  I didn&#146;t like that at all.  To me, it seemed like they were two dead cards.  The other main gripe that I had about Hunt Down was Mara Jade.  Don&#146;t get me wrong- Mara is a good character, but not good enough.	Mara doesn&#146;t have a very good life expectancy.  Lightsabers slice through here like a knife through, well, Mara Jade.  Immunity to attrition &lt;4 never seemed to do anything.  Of course, without a second stick, it didn&#146;t seem worthwhile playing You Are Beaten.  The last gripe was vs EBO with X-Wings or even any space based deck, your ships get slaughtered.  Vs EBO, Ice Storm means that it&#146;s really hard to set up Decree.  And of course, if you lose the Executor, you look really, really stupid.<br>
<br>
I was stuck.  I didn&#146;t know what to do.  I obviously needed to protect my Visage from spies, yet didn&#146;t want to play Ephant Mon.  I wanted to be able to kill characters, yet I didn&#146;t want to play Mara Jade.  I wanted to be able to deal with EBO and space, yet I didn&#146;t want to play the Executor or Decree.  I finally figured out what I would do.  I had one Dark Reflections II card.  Grand Admiral Thrawn (GAT!).  Here&#146;s what I did.<br>
<br>
Out:<br>
Mara Jade<br>
Mara Jade&#146;s Stick<br>
You Are Beaten<br>
Executor<br>
Fett In Ship<br>
Power Of The Hutt<br>
Ephant Mon<br>
... and some other standard stuff<br>
<br>
In:<br>
Grand Admiral Thrawn<br>
Death Squadron Star Destroyer (!)<br>
Admiral Ozzel<br>
Admiral Chiraneau<br>
Imperial Command<br>
Fett With Gun<br>
Tempest 1<br>
Trample<br>
Put All Sections On Alert<br>
<br>
Ok.  Here&#146;s the explanation.  The whole admiral thingo was just because it&#146;s useless playing just GAT and Chimaera.  You need to go the whole hog, unless you play something like two of each.  The Death Squadron Star Destroyer was to have another decent ship to work with GAT (I didn&#146;t think that GAT on Dominator was really all that good :).  Ozzel was because he&#146;s the man if you get him or Imperial Command first turn and put him to the Executor: Docking Bay and he pilots walkers well.  Chiraneau was included because he&#146;s a great pilot and he can really make it worthwhile to deploy some ships to Rendilli against ground based mains decks.  I took out Fett In Ship for normal Fett because I wanted an extra gun, having lost Mara Jade, he can pilot the DSSD well and he adds a destiny against Han, who I was expecting to see be an important character in Watch Your Step.  I added Tempest 1 to go with Blizzard 2 and to give me enough walkers to play Trample, which can easily squish Ben as the game progresses.	Put All Sections On Alert was to protect Janus/Sim, who I was putting at the Holotheatre to protect Visage.  Think about it.  No-one deploys big guns there, and half of them are useless there anyway with flipped Hunt Down.	Scrub spy + another scrub is what you&#146;ll usually see.  Stop their destiny draw.  You draw one.  Next turn, only one guy remains.  I was also thinking that Xizor would be cool instead of Ephant Mon for the same reason, but I didn&#146;t own one.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, yeah, that&#146;s what I was thinking when I made this deck.  It went 2-0 in the tournament that I played it in, defeating two WYS decks by 25 and 26.  Needless to say, I didn&#146;t encounter any great players with it.  Anyhow, this is exactly how I played it.  I have now acquired a Xizor and an Arica, so I&#146;d probably try to fit in at least the Xizor, purely because he&#146;s a great character to protect Visage with.	It&#146;s not optimal, it&#146;s more a theme deck.  I would, however, say that the whole theory that walkers and tramples are better than Mara Jade is exactly right, although Arica looks really interesting.  I&#146;m not sure if Decree is necessary, but from what I&#146;ve seen it isn&#146;t easy enough to set up.  The one thing that I would try to fit in is another HoloNet Transmission, or at least another Visage.  Perhaps take out a Masterful Move, but I&#146;m not sure.	Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Matchups:<br>
<br>
Vs.  Mains<br>
<br>
Secret Plans can help to stop retrieval A LOT, seeing as you shouldn&#146;t give away more than one or two force.  There&#146;s no real tech in here, just play with the cards that you draw.  They should all be cool.  Try and set up Chiraneau to drain at Rendilli on the side, if you can.  Other than that, just kill stuff.  There&#146;s not really much other advice that I can give.<br>
<br>
Vs.  Profit<br>
<br>
Don&#146;t start with any aliens.  That&#146;s stupid.	Treat it like normal mains, but don&#146;t lose your cool because of the direct damage.  Perhaps non-epic duel Massa Luke, seeing as he&#146;ll be two power less than you.<br>
<br>
Vs.  EBO<br>
<br>
Tough matchup.	Start with YCHF and ditch it for either Search and Destroy or Battle Order.  Only deploy the Death Star: Docking Bay- leave the CC: Docking Bay alone.	Put Vader on the Death Star.  Put walkers at the 4th marker.  Kill anything that goes to the ground and try to win off a combination of Battle Order and direct damage.  Decree is too hard to get working.  You should be faster than them and you will win if you get off a reasonable Monnok early.<br>
<br>
Vs.  Hidden Base (Space)<br>
<br>
The only matchup where you actually need the second docking bay.  Treat like EBO.<br>
<br>
Questions that I will be asked:<br>
<br>
Luca, why is the strategy section not as detailed as usual?<br>
<br>
Well, Fred, it&#146;s because there&#146;s little strategy involved in it.  As with all Hunt Down decks, you just decimate your opponent.  There are no other tricks.<br>
<br>
Do you expect me to take this deck seriously?<br>
<br>
Well, semi-seriously.<br>
<br>
What do you do in the remote case that ... ?<br>
<br>
Well, John, you have to realize that a lot of the time, Hunt Down is too fast to be caught in one of those situations.	For example, sure I could play Dead Ewok to kill lots of Ewoks, but I would rather just win.<br>
<br>
Luca, are you taking this seriously?<br>
<br>
Bob, no.  I figure that some idiot will not understand it and review it and give it three and a half stars, anyway, so I&#146;ll try to save myself some effort.  I will, however, answer any questions that you may have about this deck if you drop me a d-mail.<br>
<br>
So how is this any different from any other Hunt Down deck?<br>
<br>
It&#146;s fairly similar, it&#146;s just got admiral tech.  Don&#146;t subtract stars for originality.	If I&#146;m using similar cards to other people, it&#146;s because they&#146;re the best.  You would probably play the same type of stuff, too.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you either learnt something from this, or I will learn something from your review :)<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
