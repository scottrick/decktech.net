<br>
The way this works is very easy. You use you objective to pull your sites and biker scouts. Once that is donflip and get overseeing it peronsaly into hand using your objective and get emporer out and that set up. now you can drain for 2 at each site and still be able to react using you biker scouts. you cannons can shoot every thing with the 6’s floating around that you have. cross fire screws hbx with s-foils while you bounty hunter ships are out giving havok in space. The main thing with this deck is that you have to play your game and the other persons. DOn’t pod race dont do any of that stuff. just play your game. I will garuntee you will win as long as you don’t move off of ralittaar. also later in the game you can use out flank to really get your opponnet screwed by reacting with all the others except the ones on the sides. also, onnee tay. in the begining do not deploy so thin and all to one site. then spread out and start to drain. accalterate works real well for that. other than that mence won’t hurt that bad as you can still drain for 6 a turn. the problem you will have is patrol crafts with place raiders. here is what you do. use your guns to blast the to kill them off. you can easly over power them. first crossfire and the biker scout pilots adds 3 to power. so you are looking at a total of about 13 power with 2 who just fired one weapon each. not including outflaned and others little goodies like that. the effects such as royal escourt will give a better chance at lasting against lightsaber attacks. lets you use the manulver of the vechial and adds 1 to forfeit. Seach and destory will let you add a forfeit and make them occupy a battle ground. other than that there should be nothing esle you will have any major problems with. if you want you can can run odds with you having 12 total. 3 from biker scouts and 6 from pappy. <br>
