Hey gseiva your review makes a lot of sense.  This is exactly the reason I stopped posting stuff to the idiots on this site in the first place.<br>
<br>
One-Arm.  I told you why I use Fenson, to subtract from On and Off the Edge.  You should do what G.W.Bush is doing and learn to read.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey everyone it&#8217;s been a while since I submitted a deck, but I thought I&#8217;d submit my latest Hunt Down deck.<br>
<br>
Basically I made this deck because it can hold it&#8217;s own against anything the light side player can come up with and it has the power to beat mains.<br>
<br>
You start most games the same, with the two docking bay effects and crush the rebellion.  If you are playing a quality player who starts your insight serves you well (meaning they will pull honor to screw you over) you start no escape instead.  Most people don&#8217;t remember that dark side is supposed to reveal their starting first, well you can take advantage of this.  <br>
<br>
Now on to a few matchups:<br>
<br>
Mains:<br>
<br>
Set up visage and drains and make them come to you on cloud city, be careful battling them at docking bays because of the ever powerful fallen portal and use weapon levitation on your turn before you battle, because it is unique.  Play smart and your drains will overwhelm them.  Use navy trooper fenson to hurt their retrieval with on and off the edge.<br>
<br>
WYS:<br>
<br>
If you suspect the variant with Palace Raiders pull the evader/monnok combo and time it well to hamper them.  Your drains and well timed battles in space will win you the game.<br>
<br>
EBO:<br>
<br>
Outdrain them and use Mosep early to hurt them.  You wouldn&#8217;t believe how many times I&#8217;ve played against EBO and they never even set up.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can&#8217;t think of any more matchups right now, if you want more explanations on cards or matchups let me know.<br>
