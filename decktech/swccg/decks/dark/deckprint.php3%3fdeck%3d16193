This is basically the deck I used to win SC states, refined, and modified with the cards available in the next 5 days. Before you get upset that I’m submitting deck(s) with the new cards, though they aren’t out yet, perhaps consider this: This new set, Tatooine, will drastically change the way we play the game. Anti spy crap won’t save you from Jar Jar, Anti Rebel stuff won’t protect against Obi-Wan (padawan) or Qui-gon, and sense is no longer a guarantee that you can save your jedi from dueling. Even Vader is no longer safe, there being a USED interrupt that cancels his game text! Thus, I don’t want to be the person at Worlds who never bothered to consider that leaving Ephant Mon at the Holotheatre to guard Visage might not be viable anymore!<br>
<br>
Strategy:Basically, I wanted to make a Big Blue Mains and Toys Deck, with some good game-altering techniques. This is why I used SYCFA flip in States, and why I won (though I must give Props to Ben Shanks -- He had me by all rights, and though I wanted to beat him straight up, what happened was unfortunate, and NOT the way I ever want to win a tournament. I’ll post a tournament report soon for it.) SYCFA has a huge and underrated draining potential, and though Jedi testing does tend to disrupt it some, more good players tend to use Menace Fades than Test 1, and this deck does have ways to combat Dagobah. Against a player using Menace Fades, all you have to do is deny them either space or ground to cancel it, and this deck can do that. <br>
<br>
Why Use Vader w/Saber? Due to the new interrupt, End Of A Reign, Vader can no longer count on holding a site and surviving. All the opponent has to do is use four force to cancel his game text, and therefore his immunity, and he’s toast to any epp that can draw a destiny of 1. Therefore, the Spot Vader usually fills in a deck as a site holder I delegated to Darth Maul, who, when you come right down to it, fills the role much more ideally. However, Vader as a Hit-man was too tempting, especially with the new interrupt, Join Me. This says that if Vader just cut Luke, the opponent can chose to either immediately place him on the bottom of the used pile or turn him to the darkside at the end of the battle...therefore you lose vader to attrition, but potentially gain a new Dark Jedi in the process. Vader also can add 2 destiny in battles against Luke, or 1 destiny against any Rebel with ability greater than 2...han, leia, obi, wedge, General Cal, Madine, the list goes on....by using I Have You Now. Vader is indeed a valuable hit squad by himself.<br>
<br>
No Lateral Damage? Thats Right. Not that its bad, it isn’t. I simply don’t have room. If you have any suggestions, please make them. The Other reason is that Most! people don’t have too much space, and so the star destroyers can overwhelm them. If there is a Capital Star Ship you want to get rid of, use the super Laser if you have to. Against Dash and Outrider, use Chimaera/Thrawn/Guri/ImpCommand to shut it down the old fashioned way. Also, Don’t forget that the executor can carry your Bounty Hunter Ships. So What, you say? The Same Rule that allows EPP Leia to add destiny on SuperFalcon applies here. The wording of most of the BH ships says IN BATTLE AT SAME LOCATION, not if they are present. Just stick Dengar-N-Boat on Big E, then add someone to draw destiny, and watch the opponent die horribly. Same thing Works for Zuckuss-n-Boat and 4-LOM...He still adds destiny. <br>
<br>
Landing on Dagobah...Zuckuss-n-boat. He can carry 4 people down to the Forbidden Planet...Mara, Vader, Maul (who can duel Yoda!), and 4-LOM. If that’s not enough of a hit squad, my friend, I think you ask too much. You can cancel yoda’s text, if they are training Luke (most train Daughter, but you never know) you can possibly turn him...that WILL kill a training deck.if its Leia, you can use I have you now. You get three swings...need I say more. I know this is the ideal situation, getting out all three, but frankly, by the time you can even think about getting out there and NOT about blowing away Alderaan, you should have gone through a bit of your cards and should have at least 2 or three of the characters.<br>
<br>
Weapon Levitation: KNOW YOUR DECK! if you are getting ready search for the superlaser and have Weapon Levitation in your hand in the first few turns, wait and look for Evader...thereby checking to see if the super laser is in the deck. If not, deploy a bunch and then useweapon Levitation. And while we’re on pulling cards, before you activate on the first turn pull CPI with A Million Voices. Weapon Lev is also great for disabling the ultra annoying Obi-Wan’s Journal or LS Proficiency...no lightsaber = no work. It also means you won’t have to witness other nasty surprises like Dark Approach vs. Emperor, Blaster Proficiency(instant kill), or Glancing Blow. Also good for finding Lightsabers.<br>
<br>
You don’t really need to deploy space until you flip, but then it goes FAST! Big Blue is effetive. Beware Egregious Pilot Error, collision, and We can Outmanuever Them, as well as Star Destroyer!. Destiny adders can only affect you if you let them, so try to be careful, and get out the Adm. Order asap. Godherdt provides protection from the Claw, and Chiraneau makes the game obscene. If you get him to Fondor on Big E, you can drain for not only 4 there, at Hoth, and at Yavin4, but for 5 at Sullust and Endor, EACH! it’s well worth it. <br>
<br>
No War Room!? yep. Here’s why: I’m Insane. Ok, really, I do have a very good reason, actually several:At the Conference Room, they don’t add a destiny for attacking. You don’t have to spread out to hold 2 interior sites, and so can concentrate on the one, helping avoid beat-downs. The conference room can add +1 to CPI if you have the emperor there. Also, though the War Room is a Twix site(2-4-ME, 0-4-U), I have come to regret the added location for force drain by the opponent should you be unlucky enough to kick you on the ground and you not have CHYBC out.<br>
<br>
You should be able to get a high enough bonus off the 2 sites and 3 gunners to to blow up everything.<br>
<br>
Versus:<br>
Operatives: Blow up the subjugated planet. Period. Ususllay, the only tourny ops decks are Alderaanian, so the game should be quick, brutal, fun for you, and they should realize that &#148;pacifists&#148; are good in War after all...as target practice. ;)<br>
<br>
EBO: Blow up Hoth. control space. Grab Orgy Attack.<br>
<br>
MBO: Blow them up, too. Use mains to deny them a flip, Monok to control hand size so they can’t draw what they need, and low them up fast. In all things, blow up alderaan on your way, since you don’t have to worry about not having CPI (1000000 Voices)<br>
<br>
RTP: Guess what? They’ve got a superlaser with thier names on it! If they fight you on the DS, you should have no problem, as most of these decks focus on destiny adders.<br>
<br>
Hidden mains: save grabbers for Fallen Portan and recyclers. Let SSPFT eliminate their retrieval...they can have it, but only if they have two BG’s, thanks to CHYBC. Fight them with your dark Jedi and Mara, and use the Emperor to guard the Flag (your gunners). If worst comes to worse, drain them in space and do small sniping attacks with your mains.<br>
<br>
WYS: OK, Folks: Plop down Darth Maul at the Cantina. The only 2 characters they have that can touch you are melas and Luke. Melas might be a problem, so be careful. Luke, though....I Have You Now works for ANY Dark Jedi. So, Vader, Maul, And Emperor are good to go. Use Guri with Maul if you are worried about a beat down. In space, use Imperial Command, Georgia Thrawn and Dengar-n-boat/Zuckuss-n-boat to shut down those bad smuggler pests. Grab their cards. Eat their babies. Pee on their homes ;) (all in good fun) In the words of the good guys, &#148;You don’t need THEIR scum.&#148;<br>
<br>
Throne room Mains: Ok, folks, they made the mistake of playing on Yavin 4. You get enough activation that the choke shouldn’t kill you, and Revolution is canceled by the objective. You may have to fight to get going, but once you take out Yavin 4, making them lose at least 19 force (2+1+1+1, x2 for being a rebel base, then +9 for 3 sites), and also denying them their main activation base, the game should be yours.<br>
<br>
Testing: Use Sim Aloo to screw them up, Drain fast and furious, and get zuckuss & hit squad down there to wreack havoc. also, Get out CHYBC, as this will force them to move quickly to get two battle grounds so if they are flipping or otrherwise they can retrieve. If they plan on draining at CC sites...good. These are mobile sites, therefore Crush will hurt them. <br>
<br>
non-unique aliens: hopefully that will have petered out, but if not, feel free to stick in generic lightsabers and then use Sith Rage? a card from Tat where you lose a saber and they lose all non-unique aliens in same battle. Otherwise, place maul at their forcedrain locationto drain right through them. Note: OTE will not work against Maul in this case, as they have no ability at sme site :) Eloms have no effect other than dying until you flip, as power makes no difference, so don’t worry too much<br>
<br>
Versus Qui-gon, Padawan Obi, JarJar, 3po w/ parts showing, Shmi skywalker: You’re probably as worried as I am. I am trying to find room for a force lightning in the deck so that I can take out JarJar before his friends can arrive (Hutt Smooch won’t stop him from deploying, as he is not a spy). Against any of the others, you can either exclude them with You Are Beaten or use 4lom on them. Also, until they change the rules on Starfighters at dockingbays, you can use Zuckuss and Dengar in ships at the DS dockingbay to shut them down completely. If the rule has been changed, and ships gametext is canceled at docking bays, please let me know.<br>
Sim Aloo is generally good, and most people tend to forget about him, so use him after they use Shmi/3PO combo to make them say ’uncle’. He is also useful if they are using &#148;edge’ cards, Fallen Portals, or other tracking (inluding test 5, but you should have already WON that game.) Janus is good for tracking your own destinies, and recycling I Have you Now’s, so use him freely.<br>
<br>
I can’t cover every contingency, but if you happen to lose a few gunners, don’t forget that Put All Sections On Alert retrieves up to 2 back into your hand (so if you DO miss a planet or get a beatdown upon thine rear you can recover) Also, The Objective says TAKE INTO HAND, not DEPLOY FROM RESERVE, a common misconception, so if you ARE worried about a beat down, you can hold them. The only problem is Monok. My suggestion: Keep one deployed on deathstar, keep one in hand, keep one in reserve deck. On the turn before you blow up alderaan, first play the gunner in your hand, then grab the one in your deck and deploy him. I usually guard these guys with the Emperor and his cronies, but you can stick them on Zuckus-n-MH at the dockingbay, to avoid beatdown and Portal.<br>
<br>
Please write comments and recommendations on the reviews, and though I know the cards won’t be out for another FIVE days, don’t give it a bad review just because of that. I don’t know if Decipher knew exactly what they were doing with this new set, but rather than being caught flatfooted at a tournament, having not looked at all the ramifications of the new cards. thanks for taking the time to read all of this. I know it is a lot of text!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
