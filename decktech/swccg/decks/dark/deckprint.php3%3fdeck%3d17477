Stupid me, I forgot Ops couldn&#8217;t drain by themselves. Take out some stuff for 5 Navy Troopers, a Tactical Support, and an Imperial Supply. Sorry about that.<br>

<br>
**Edit #2**<br>
The reason I choose to start the Swamp over the forest is because it costs them +3 to initiate a battle. Besides, I can pull the Forest first turn anyway.<br>

To 217: Maybe if you had read the Strat., you wouldn&#146;t be such an idiot. <br>

<br>
First of all, I&#8217;d like to warn you that this deck is just for fun. I might try using it in a local tournament, but only if I think I&#8217;m having a lucky day. Please don&#8217;t give me a 1* because you don&#8217;t think it will win any tourneys. I couldn&#8217;t agree more with you.<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, I&#8217;ll start off by going over some card choices:<br>
<br>
Old School Tech Package:<br>
ADT, Close Call, and SCrews get rid of mains. It&#8217;s limted to 2 of each copy because YISYW will kill the SCrews and Scrambled Transmission makes ADT a Lost Interrupt. I&#8217;d like to fit in Voyeur to make this combo even better, but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to putting that in yet.<br>
<br>
Podracing:<br>
After all of the sites have been pulled, the destiny layout looks like this:<br>
0&#8217;s-0<br>
1&#8217;s-0<br>
2&#8217;s-5<br>
3&#8217;s-27<br>
4&#8217;s-7<br>
5&#8217;s-6<br>
6&#8217;s-3<br>
This means that Sebulba will kick names and take a$$ (told you he was gay) and the 11 force retrieval will soon be mine.<br>
<br>
Omni Box & It&#8217;s Worse:<br>
You just ICBW&#8217;d the race? Hah! It also doubles as a Used Control with Sy Snootles.<br>
<br>
Musicians:<br>
Characters who have destiny of 3 (won&#8217;t hurt my Odds) and they can become very powerful when they all start jamming at the same site. Too bad most of the better musicians are destiny < 3, or else they would be in here as well.<br>
<br>
Space Selection:<br>
The Scythes are all destiny 4 and they can Tallon Roll pretty good. Black TIE is a good Roller as well. Flexecuter is a destiny 4, which is why I chose it over the destiny 1 Exe. The AO is in there because, well, it&#8217;s just awesome (read: Gay). My Ops deploy for free, get a forfiet bonus, and a get defense bonus that will almost never stop an EPP weapon, but who knows.<br>
<br>
2X-7KPR:<br>
Whoa. Stick him at a site under nightime conditions and my Ops can become power 7! Gives them a little immunity as well. Combine this with the AO and they&#8217;ll be mini-machines.<br>
<br>
Now, how to play this deck.<br>
Drop Operatives with back up from the musicians and take your battle damage like a man, it doesn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can start draining for millions by like turn 3, your opponent won&#8217;t have enough force to drop a beatdown squad (especially if you get Mosep out). Combine that with SCrews, ADT, and Close Call and they&#8217;ll never get anybody out. I&#8217;m not going to do matchups because it&#8217;s pretty pointless. Just win the race, insert as much as possible,  drain for tons, and you&#8217;ll win. I want to try and fit some more defensive cards in here, just in case, such as more Barriers, some Wookie Kissers, and some Projective Telepathies. Some Dreadnaughts wouldn&#8217;t be bad, especially if the regular Oppressive Enforcement is thrown in also (destiny 4 Dreadnaughts, destiny 5 Flexecuter).<br>
<br>
If this deck gets decent reviews, I&#8217;ll post the slightly less gay LS counterpart. Have fun with this deck, and don&#8217;t assume you can win anything with it. Be careful though, it just may surprise you.<br>
