Getting a vader in hand shouldn't be a problem.  If they go somewhere else, bring vader into hand then go beatdown there.	The swoops are in there to follow people for beatdown.	There is also a lot of high destiny.<br>
<br>
I see your suggestions are right. I am taking out EPP Boba and both flare racing swoops for battle order,Endor, and a resitance.<br>
<br>
Also for the profit strategy,  I was thinking mainly about my strategy vs. a profit deck i played yesterday.  That is why the strategy sucks.<br>
<br>
vs.  Space<br>
this is the hardest match up.  Start with security precautions or IAO to get the battle ground you need first turn. Later in the game,	use IAO to look at your deck.  Don't use it early in the game though.	Flip second turn and hope that he will be  hurt by visage and high drains.  Get blast door controls out for rebel barrier protection. Use bubo and Pol tridum for anti-spies.<br>
<br>
vs. profit<br>
Start with jade and fett.  Get vader out ASAP to the palace unless they start with epp han because it is likely a speed profit. Make them deploy their sites.  If they leave han alone then it means they probally got a Narrow escape/fallen portal.  Deploy blast door controls and beatdown.  Try to keep han off table because there won't be a lot of other sites for them to drain at.  Use coward to stop executer drains.<br>
<br>
vs. throne room.<br>
This is another hard match up. Usually start with IAO unless you know that there are playing revo then start crush.   get the docking bay out so you have access to their sites.  Kill of the nudj's and invade yavin with characters in walkers.<br>
<br>
Have fun reviewing it.	Thanx for the comments so far. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
