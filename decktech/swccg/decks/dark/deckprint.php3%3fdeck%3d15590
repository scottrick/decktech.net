I spent a lot of time on it.  Oh well.  The space fleet is enough, it doesn&#146;t die, trust me.  And the deck has little ground force because it doesn&#146;t go battle on ground...it plays the drain race.  Anyhoo...<br>
<br>
The strategy doesn&#8217;t change too much from the previous version, except for teching against certain annoying new decks (cough, Watch Your Step, cough) and adding in Reflections 2 cards (Thrawn is the man!).  So anyway, here goes.  This is long, so bear with me and I&#8217;ll try to point out as many little tricks as possible.  I don&#8217;t know where this will go after Tatooine.  We&#8217;ll see.<br>
<br>
This part is for &#8217;steve ramsie&#8217;....please read my strategy at least a bit before commenting...thanx<br>
<br>
The 15 Imperial Command thing is kind of a joke. Needless to say, it had some scare value behind it.  The deck runs six Imperial Commands, which may indeed seem like a lot.  I have discovered, however, that six Imperial Commands is the perfect number for this deck. If it gets grabbed, it gets grabbed. It&#8217;s bound to happen. Unless they start Wise Advice, play them to search when they don&#8217;t have 3 force activated. If they do grab it, you still have 5 more times to stop the superfalcon from drawing more than one destiny. That should be more than enough to draw enough destiny to kill it off. And paying up to 5 extra force is no biggy for this deck. If it gets grabbed, it really isn&#8217;t a huge deal with various space beef. Also, Guri works as a permament, ungrabable Imperial Command by restricting destiny. The point is, Command grabbed or not, the deck can beat in space. Imperial Command is only essential for grabbing Piett then Merrejk, Fondor and Kashyyk for and starting the activation engine early.<br>
<br>
The goal of this deck is to use huge early activation and a reliable engine to either beat in space or outdrain against ground.<br>
<br>
First off: the engine. Start Imperial Arrest Order and Mobilization Points always, the third effect rotates. In your opening hand there should be at least one of the Imperial Commands, Piett or Merrejk. Any of these will start the engine. Should you not get one, during the first turn when you&#8217;re searching your reserve for various other things, check to see if one is in your active pile, and, if so, draw for it. If you have an Imperial Command, play it before you activate to grab Admiral Piett (If you have Piett in hand, grab Ozzel unless they started Wise Advice). Also, if you didn&#8217;t get the Executor in your opening hand, use Mobilization Points to pull it. Then activate your five plus whatever they give you. Use Imperial Arrest Order to grab Executor: Docking Bay, if it isnt there grab Coruscant: Docking Bay. Check to see if Death Star: War Room and Merrejk are in your reserve. If the War Room is, pull it with the objective. Against Watch Your Step, if they Force choke it might be better not to deploy the War Room and save yourself the pain of a site to drain for 2.  Or if you have Vader or Coward in hand, go ahead and deploy it. Deploy Piett to the docking bay you pulled. If Merrejk is in reserve deck, pull him with Piett, drop him to the same docking bay as Piett (Piett deploys for 2 to Executor DB) and grab a system from reserve. Go for Fondor first, then Kashyyyk. If Merrejk is in the force pile, you&#8217;ll have to draw for him, or use the force and search during your opponent&#8217;s turn.  If you have Fondor (or even Kashyyyk) in opening hand, the engine isn&#8217;t as essential.  You won&#8217;t need Merrejk to get all your systems unless you intend on playing a drain race, which isn&#8217;t very frequent nowadays.<br>
<br>
On your second turn, you will be activating 4 from the sites you started, +2 war room, +3 docking bay with piett/Merrejk, +2 Fondor, +whatever the opponent gives you, +1, assuming the engine goes off perfectly, as it usually does. It&#8217;s pretty much guranteed you&#8217;ll be activating from 10 to 15 on the second turn. On the second turn, Executor drops for 10 to Fondor, the guys at the Executor Docking Bay move into the Executor co&#8217;ckpit area and the Executor moves to a drain 2 system.  Bam, your are set up turn 2 and ready to start adapting to your opponent&#8217;s deck and drawing for the cards you need.<br>
<br>
This deck can outdrain almost every ground drain deck (Agents, Profit, etc). Merrejk makes sure that you have a few drain systems out, Imperial Command grabs Chiraneau to make space drains a max of 3,3,3,2. Draw up for ships and spread in space if the opponent isn&#8217;t going to come to you (like in an Agents or Profit deck). The deck then focuses on hurting the opponent&#8217;s drains while continously hammering for 2-4 solid heavy drains. Battle Order makes things expensive, this deck can afford to pay it, after the first few turns it doesnt do much but draw. U-3P0 and Arica block 2 drains. Dark Waters helps. The real trick to the deck (and I owe my victories over Profit and Agents to it) is Imperial Decree. You&#8217;ll have two space locations controlled, and anyone at the Coruscant Docking Bay means Decree is in effect. I typically drop Dark Lord or Emperor there. Should anyone come to Coruscant via transit, choke Vader can set up some destinies (cycle Imp Commands, Operational As Planned, Twilek, etc) and hopefully take down whatever comes. Spies are a problem. Emperor can Force Lightning. The nice thing is, hardly anyone is prepared in a draining deck to have to deal with Decree in this manner. How many spies do Profit, Agents or Watch Your Step run? Dark Waters is mainly tech against Watch Your Step, combine it with Decree and Undercover spies and you can shut down drains real well.  Landing Claw isn&#8217;t cool.  The Ghhhk combo cancels it, but Yoxgit can make it reoccuring.  Try to do some fancing moving and be able to play Gravity Shadow or something.  How often do you see Landing Claws anymore?<br>
<br>
Should the opponent be playing space, you set up for that instead. Superfalcon tactics are destroyed by Imperial Command, Guri and huge power early. Against EBO or Hidden Base, you amass a fleet and don&#8217;t spread them out as much. The Death Squadrons deploy -2 to Executor, -1 Piett and -1 Ozzel. That&#8217;s a Death Squadron Destroyer for 5 force! Against Superfalcon, Imperial Command can do its thing and you should be able to smash them on power (Against Assets, you have Operational As Planned to ensure that the commands go through. We&#8217;re In Attack Position Now also helps against space decks, especially starfighter heavy decks. Combined with Imperial Command, your ships should be very difficult to take out.  Thrawn and Bossk add destinies, Executor turn 2 is immune to <12 (14 with the Admiral&#8217;s Order) and Dengar will fix any immunity problems (i.e. Home One).  Lateral Damage is always amazing.  Control & Set For Stun can bounce Haashn or Bantha Droid.  Gravity Shadow is simply amazing.  You can restrict their ships from running away from your fleet and beat them down (sometimes you&#8217;ll even blow the ship up, although this is less frequent).  The destiny in the deck is high enough to make this draw blind and hit it most of the time.  Wait until he moves all but one ship away and restrict the last, Lat Damage, beat and win.  This deck has a few utility cards that seriously beat in space.  The first is Grav Shadow, as explained above.  Control & Set For Stun can return Dash, Capn Han, etc to opponents hand during your turn so you can beat.  And of course the Commands and Lat Damage.  Command + Thrawn + Bossk = 4 destiny.  Against heavy space, play smart with these and you&#8217;ll be able to take down pretty much any fleet.<br>
<br>
Now, let me go through some individual match-ups.<br>
<br>
Watch Your Step - Since this is the most popular deck around right now, I have to discuss it first here.  The Imperial Commands and Guri are perfect for holding Watch Your Step out of space.  Get to Tatooine with Executor, Piett and Merrejk turn 2.  Without extra destinies their fleet should fall apart fairly quick if they attack early.  Once you&#8217;ve got them out of space, or should they not come, spread and drain. Be wary of Darklighter Spin.  Dark Waters shuts down docking bay drains and an undercover spy takes care of the Cantina.  Starting can be Secret Plans.  With the advent of WYS, I originally retired this deck because of lack of activation.  But I&#8217;ve discovered it isnt a huge problem.  They give you 2 Force and are forced to flip first turn to cut off several more Force.  Even with WYS flipped turn 1, you get 8-10 Force on the second turn.  Emperor Palpatine is an additional help.  Drop him to the Death Star Docking Bay for 3 extra force each turn if needed.  WYS will have a difficult time removing him seeing as how the deck is typically low on weapons (Luke EPP only goes so far).  I&#8217;ve found that the activation really isn&#8217;t a huge problem.  It may slow the deck down a turn at most, but it will still beat in space and eliminate ground drains.  At one recent tournament, this crushed two WYS decks by more than 20 Force (and this deck deploys a lot of cards!).<br>
<br>
Agents - Third effect is Decree. Drop early in space and get some early drain systems going, and spread eventually to about 3 or 4. Get Decree in effect and drop Undercover spies and Dark Waters. Battle Order curbs their drawing ability. Secret Plans will hurt their retrieval. Grab Shadda Chimes, You Will Take Me To Jabba Now, ICBW or any retrieval interrupts. You&#8217;d think that being able to cancel a drain or two each turn would allow them to outdrain you, but the eventually will simply run out of reps and aliens to cancel, and your anti-drain stuff will still be going. A well teched Agents deck will beat this, but this has enough surprise value that it should win most of the time. In one tournament it beat two Agents deck, one of which dropped Jedi Luke with Saber to Entrance Cavern first turn and another than had to have retrieved a bazillion force and cancelled a bazillion drains.<br>
<br>
Profit - Play similar to Agents. Start Decree. Go for drains. Profit will be an even more hardcore drain race than Agents. You can&#8217;t stop their profit damage and they can&#8217;t cancel your drains. Decree, Order, Dark Waters and spies should give this deck the upper-hand, however.<br>
<br>
Hidden Base - Third effect is Secret Plans. Keep your fleet together at one system and drain for three until they drop some ships. If they play swarm, grab Organized Attack and All Wings. Against a Squassin version, just beat and use the different space interrupts to keep there fleet scattered. Imperial Command will keep them down to one destiny or push you up to 2. This deck has enough beef in space that it should be able to take down the opponent&#8217;s fleet.  Against mains, beat in space and cancel ground drains.  Grab retrieval interrupts.<br>
<br>
EBO - Third Effect is Decree. Again, keep the fleet together. You&#8217;ll be activating huge early amounts and should be able to be established by the time they come to space. Against starfighters, Imperial Command their destiny&#8217;s and battle their ships. You should have no problem competing with their power. Should they drop Baragwins, Figrin, play Coward. Against Deadbolt, you have Operational As Planned. Against a star cruiser version, look for the Dengar. For them track destinies. Hitting some crucial ships truely wins against EBO. Should they try and spread and drain, get Order and Decree going.  EBOx and spread decks require fancy techniques with Gravity Shadow (hold a ship back and beat, it&#8217;ll even stop Hyperescape, as will Ghhhk combo).<br>
<br>
Throne Room - Be wary of how much force they activate, you don&#8217;t want to get jumped by spies early at a docking bay. Grab Sense if it becomes a problem. Here, drop spies to any ground site they try to exploite and force them into space, where you should vastly outpower them. This is the deck&#8217;s shakiest match-up because early spies can disrupt the early game engine.<br>
<br>
Basically, if you&#8217;re going to running a drain race, get out Decree, Order and spies. Otherwise, prepare the fleet for some major ass-whooping. This deck has huge out-drain abilities and huge space beats.<br>
<br>
As a last note, Sense and Alter are not at all a problem. The deck has very few effects in danger of Alter. Also, if you look at the interrupts, most of them are going to be important against decks that have little or no Senses. Not a huge problem nowadays.<br>
<br>
Also, a nice benefit of the deck is how little Out Of Commission hurts it. Not much to place out of play.<br>
<br>
Now, I&#8217;ll run through the individual cards.<br>
<br>
Objective (1):<br>
Set Your Course For Alderaan - 5 force for me, 2 for you, no revolution, pulls War Room. Basically, it jumpstarts the deck, even though it gives away early force.<br>
<br>
Locations (10):<br>
Alderaan<br>
Coruscant: Docking Bay - HUGE! It runs Decree and works with IAO and Mob Points<br>
Death Star<br>
Death Star: Docking Bay - Remember the auto-Ghhhk.  Emperor sits here for Battle Order and activation.<br>
Death Star: War Room - activation and obj pulls it<br>
Endor - 2 drain for me, 1 for you<br>
Executor: Docking Bay - Piett drops -2, pilots can use this site to get on and off the the Executor<br>
Fondor - Executor drops -5, 2/1 drain -1 system<br>
Kashyyyk - 2/1 drain +1 system<br>
Sullust - 2/2 drain system<br>
<br>
Characters (13):<br>
Admiral Chiraneau - drains +1 at systems where you have a destroyer<br>
Admiral Motti - forfeit 5, cheap deploy, drops Rebel pilots forfeit.<br>
Admiral Ozzel - excellent deploy, forfeit, makes capital ships -1 deploy<br>
Admiral Piett - grabs Merrejk, makes capital ships deploy -1<br>
Arica - Undercover and can hold her own for a bit if need be.<br>
Commander Merrejk - grabs the systems<br>
Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith x2 - Can hold Coruscant Docking Bay, can do Kamakazi rushes against little aliens if given the oppurtunity<br>
Emperor Palpatine x2 - Staying value on ground.  Early activation at Death Star docking bay.  Try getting rid of this mother.  You&#8217;d be surprised how many people have tried to jump him, forgetting I take no damage at Death Star sites.<br>
Grand Admiral Thrawn - The man.<br>
Guri - Perminanet Imperial Command.  Awesome.<br>
U-3P0 - duh<br>
<br>
Starships (6):<br>
Bossk In Hound&#8217;s Tooth - Adds a destiny.<br>
Death Squadron Star Destroyer x3 - deploy 5 or 6, nice immunity<br>
Dengar In Punishing One - Get around immunity.<br>
Executor - Deploy 10 to Fondor, great immunity.  The beast.<br>
<br>
Admirals Orders (1):<br>
We&#8217;re In Attack Position Now - Pilots deploy -1 (-2 for admirals), beefs immunity, 6 destiny.<br>
<br>
Effects (12):<br>
Battle Order - Drains get expensive, you can afford it<br>
Come Here You Big Coward! - stops Death Star and War Room drains<br>
Dark Waters - Great against Profit, WYS or other Tatooine decks.<br>
Imperial Arrest Order - Awesome as always<br>
Imperial Decree - Huge, best tech in the deck<br>
Lateral Damage - Combine with Gravity Shadow and Set For Stun for beats.<br>
Mobilization Points - Grab Executor, boosts activation<br>
Secret Plans - Gotta make retrieval costly<br>
There&#8217;ll Be Hell To Pay x2 - Grab annoying interrupts (several listed above)<br>
You Cannot Hide Forever - In case Joe Schmoe actually plays inserts.<br>
<br>
Interrupts (17):<br>
Control & Set For Stun - Cancel a drain, Sense, Alter or bounce Captain Han, Bantha Droid, Hashn, Dash, TEN NUMB, etc.  Huge card.<br>
Force Lightning - Anti-spies to Coruscant.  Can help the Emperor to pick a fight if need be.  Recyclable 5.<br>
Ghhhk & Those Rebels Won&#8217;t Escape Us - Anti-HyperEscape, Claw, react, etc.<br>
Gravity Shadow x2 - Restrict the last ship from running.  Even blow up Home 1 or Falcon.  Amazing card, just try it!<br>
Imperial Command x6 - No, this isn&#8217;t too many. The card is just too versatile. Not only does it jumpstart the deck&#8217;s engine, it also grabs Chiraneau to enhance drains and the other admirals. Preventing destinies or adding them is huge, also. This card is just too huge. I bought all mine for $2 each :)<br>
Operational As Planned x2 - Put back doubles, recylable 5, anti-DTF.<br>
Prepared Defenses<br>
Projective Telepathy - Quasi-barrier, can help when you&#8217;re starving out drains, anti-Order To Engage<br>
Twi&#8217;lek Advisor x2 - Gets effects, good destiny, basic utility card.<br>
<br>
Well, that&#8217;s the crap deck. It may not look like much, but somehow it does well. It helped to win me to win several tournaments. It&#8217;s actually pretty solid, it really destroys a lot of the popular decks around right now. Any questions or comments, please feel free to mail me. Thanks so much for reading this and for your time!<br>
