            That's right boys and girls! It's back in action, the blowout card 
            Con to hit the scene last year, FreedomCon II in our nation's original 
            capital Philadelphia on October 4-6 at NeoQuest Games. 
            <p>Organized by &quot;Mighty&quot; Mike Carr of last year's FreedomCon 
              fame and sponsored by all manner of mega companies (list follows) 
              this year's FreedomCon II looks to be a huge celebration of Gaming 
              and Freedom. </p>
            <p>FreedomCon is, of course, firstly a celebration of gaming. Not 
              merely great TCG games like Magi Nation Duel, Raw Deal, Lord of 
              the Rings, Magic and Star Wars CCG, but also any others people have 
              the mind to play, including Minatures, Scrabble, Video Games, anything 
              that *you all* want to play. Mythos? Hero Clix? Tiddlywinks? More 
              power to you, get some people together and play. You have the Freedom 
              to play anything you want at FreedomCon, because it is for the players, 
              by the players. </p>
            <p>Speaking of Freedom, for those of you who remember FreedomCon I, 
              you'll recall that the proceeds went to The American Red Cross. 
              Similarly, the theme of this FreedomCon is the Freedom to live your 
              life the way you choose. </p>
            <p>We at DeckTech.net and others want to bring to your attention a 
              very serious set of maladies known collectively as Mitochondrial 
              Disorders. The Mitochondria, for those of you who may have forgotten 
              from Biology class, is the &quot;power plant&quot; of each cell 
              in your body. Yep, you need them alright! Unfortunately, many people 
              suffer from malfunctions in their mitochondria, causing their body 
              to be underpowered or even shut down. Worse, because it's relatively 
              unknown, people are frequently unaware of their problem. </p>
            <p>That's why the UMDF - United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation is 
              doing something. They are &quot;redefining hope for families affected 
              by mitochondrial diseases -- hereditary disorders, now considered 
              as common as childhood cancers, that affect the cell's ability to 
              produce life-sustaining energy. &quot; </p>
            <p>We'll be bringing you more information, and things you can do to 
              help in more announcements, and the FreedomCon II website. </p>
            <p>The rest of this week we'll be announcing more things about FreedomCon 
              including the tentative schedule. Hell, I'm almost tempted to *not* 
              give you all a schedule, it's so cool, I want you to be surprised. 
              We wanted to get the word out as soon as possible so everyone could 
              start making their plans. We know that this is a litle tight with 
              but one month to go, but we hope that's enough time for you all 
              to hop online, grab a ticket, throw a toothbrush and some cards 
              in a bag, and make your way to the East Coast for some serious and 
              seriously fun competition! </p>
