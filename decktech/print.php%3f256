Plenty of changes including a new #3 at Lord of the Rings, plenty of new names in and about, Raw Deal, and of course, the <b>#1 money leader of the year</b>.  This leads of course to an announcement shortly about the <b>DT player of the year</b><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Alan Sagan said on Tue Oct 22 2002 <br>Does this not include DPC Seattle?<hr>Steve Marshall said on Tue Oct 22 2002 <br>Patrick Hug, then #2 on SW cash list, is from AZ, not CO! Let's have a little support here. ;-)<hr>Brian Hunter said on Tue Oct 22 2002 <br>No, it does not include DPC Seattle.  In addition, although Justin Desai is listed as having won about $150 in SWCCG, he's not among the names on the list for people who've won over $100 in any game.  So this is the "almost final update", I guess.  :)  <hr>Justin Desai said on Wed Oct 23 2002 <br>Yeah and I'm not from MS either believe it or not<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Oct 23 2002 <br>You should have seen my original.  It said "Michael Dalton" and next to him, presumably his portrait, was this big lurking frowning picture of Gabe Alonso.  It was really funny.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just post any changes here, and i'll fix 'em.  Justin what state are you from again?  CT then?<br />
<br />
Oh, and if i could *ever* get the results from DPC Seattle, i'd be happy to add them in<hr>Alan Sagan said on Wed Oct 23 2002 <br>I got $40 for placing 3rd/4th whatever.  Blake Becker beat me, and he and Dave Kitzman split for 1st/2nd and got something like $190?  Peter Sundholm got $40 like me I think.  so just throw those numbers :P<hr>Doug Faust said on Wed Oct 23 2002 <br>Shawn Drew is from NY<br />
Matt Berta is from NV<br />
Greg Shaw is from NJ<br />
Chris Fanchi is from TX<hr>Brian Hunter said on Thu Oct 24 2002 <br>Guess that all depends on what you mean by "from".  Chris might be "from" TX, but lives in CO.  As for Desai not being from MS, isn't that Mississippi?  Mass. would be MA, if I remember right...cuz MI is Michigan, Montana is MT, Minnesota is MN, Missouri is MO, and Maine is ME?  If Desai is from CT, then I guess none of it matters too much, but last I heard, he was in Boston...  <hr>Justin Desai said on Fri Oct 25 2002 <br>I'm from MA.  Thanks Neal.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Oct 25 2002 <br>ok, i got all the updates thanks justin d and phrim.  Also, went with good ole sagan's unofficial stats.<br />
