Ex.  Leave Han alone a site adjacent to Obi at his hut.  The opponent thinks you're retarded and initiates an execution on Han.  Don't Underestimate Our Chance, use Help Me Obi to move Ben over and then play I Know.  Grab Daughter and Anni's Saber from your deck or hand and thow em down for free.  Play Courage On Daughter and then Jedi Presence.	Another good thing to use in Clash, if they're not playing Crush The Rebellion they're screwed.  It's a powerful enough card that I'll take a bet on someone not playing its counter.  The extra mains are for the use of the wonderful Mantellian Savrip.	This deck has a high destiny and you'll most likely get the Messes and the Lost in the Wildernesses to go through.  Under Attack is a crushing blow against walkers and it's destiny 6.<br />
<br />
Here's how to play it against most of the popular decks out there now.<br />
<br />
Hunt Down w/orw/out duel-Use Transmission Term. to cancel Visage.  If canceled by Holonet Trans. Nabrum over there.  Glancing Blow and Courage are there for minor duel protection. There are a lot of high destinies so make sure you hold on to them and track where they are.  Lost In The Wilderness helps A LOT.<br />
<br />
ISB swarm or not-Start the hut and Battle Plan.  Under Attack will take care of any walker problems.  Order to Engage will hurt a lot too.<br />
<br />
Raltir Ops-Nabrum over in the early game.  Ben's revival thing will hurt them a lot when attrition comes around.<br />
<br />
Ops-Start Battle Plan and beat the living daylights out of every stinking operative.  Order To Engage him to death.<br />
<br />
Well that's about all.  Be kind and review.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
