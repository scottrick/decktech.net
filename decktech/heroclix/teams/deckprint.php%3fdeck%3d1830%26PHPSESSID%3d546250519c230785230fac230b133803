<br />
Ok to start off this deck is currently 15-2 (15 are the wins =) and 2 were turnament wins, 1 was turnament loss.<br />
<br />
The ewoks are really powerful.<br />
<br />
Start with Chirpa's hut and careful plan for Reb Landing Site, this starts u with 4 and only gives away 1!<br />
<br />
Beginning objectives are to get out Kazak @ Hut and a bunch of desiny 3 ewoks (and or artoo! dest 6) and play numbers. Graak is great with this, having a destiny of 3, and requiring your opponent to lose FDs from RD, put him at a central site and protect him.<br />
<br />
If numbers dosen't work, or its too slow. Go ahead and go for drains, get your ithorians out and spread to drain for 2-3 a site depending on if you have Kazak, Graak is good for this also.<br />
<br />
Use ASP-707 droids to fling catapults back on to your RD and Supprise Assault Force Drains at other planets!<br />
<br />
The Counter Supprise Assault was a suggestion from Neal Razi, and protects against an annoying Counter Assault, or lets you get a beatdown on some DS characters that have invaded Endor!<br />
<br />
If you have to start fighting, keep an ithorian @ the site with your ewoks for the power and fofit bonus, Chirpa will get them ewoks out of your decks, the Spearmen will let you draw destiny if needed, Tribesmen soak up attrition, and Sentrys Rule! they can react all over the place! DOS give all your 'woks a power bonus and her 4 power is nice.<br />
<br />
For protection against Force drains you have the counter assaults, and a Barganing table, this is almost always sufficent.<br />
<br />
4 ships including Lando in falcon can protect against Battle Order and Or A Bright Center...<br />
<br />
Ewok Catapults are death to walkers and are good forfit fodder if needed.<br />
<br />
The deck is really easy to play, and fairly cheap to make.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
