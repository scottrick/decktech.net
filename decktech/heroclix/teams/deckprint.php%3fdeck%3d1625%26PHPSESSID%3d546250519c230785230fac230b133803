 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Alright, I'll let you know upfront that this deck is really weak coming of the starting gates, but if you weather the start of the game, and get it setup, then you are on your way to victory.<br />
The deck is strong because with MWYHL, it protects from S&amp;A, and with insurrection, you can get your planet sites for celebration, give your characters wicked forfeit for sac or tank, and make Elis useless<br />
Also, Yoda at his Hut gives everything Immunity &lt;3, and gives your rogues w/ matching pilots &lt;5, and falcon &lt;7!<br />
First, get out Yoda at his hut, then get both docking bays out w/insurrection.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
vs. HuntDown This deck was actually first designed to take on hunt down. Use TT and Webb to cancel Visage. Get luke in speeder so that the objective remains flipped and he can't be dueled. Get cards setup for Celebration.<br />
If Vader lands on Tatooine, run to his adjancent and cancel his FD with Harc. Just move out of his way, and keep on retrieving with Celebration.<br />
<br />
vs. Ops Get TPTIFF targetting the ops planet. Setup celebration, and get a loaded speeder or two down on the op planet with Harc to harass.<br />
<br />
vs. ISB This one has always been tough, but do-able for this deck. Get Celebration up and use either Battle Order, TPTIFF, or Bacta Tank, depending on the variantion of the ISB<br />
<br />
vs. Big Blue Usually a Big Laugh. Against space use C.Han w/Falcon, or the combo of Redemtion/Bacta Tank to care of them. On the ground, use the power harpoons to take care of the walkers. Remember, with MWYHL, S&amp;A are useless<br />
<br />
Well, thats about it. I enjoy playing with this deck because it is really different, fun to play with and is very competitive.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input you can provide about the deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
