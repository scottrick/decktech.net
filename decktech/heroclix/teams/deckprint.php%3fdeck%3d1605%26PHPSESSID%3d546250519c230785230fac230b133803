It uses the benefits of tests 1 and 2 to hurt their drains and give you the advantage in battles.Start Wise Advice almost everytime.	Here's is the strategy<br />
Sorry about that. The tests slipped my mind. Take out a Stone Pile and Savrip for the two tests. I can't believe I forgot about that. I also included The Planet That It is Farthest From when it should be Wise Advice. I must have been half asleep when I wrote this out. Sorry<br />
<br />
vs. Ops<br />
Start Wise Advice to train fast. Get tests 1 and 2 done and then go battle them, making sure they know the effects from jedi test 2. The battles should be easy ones to win, just make sure you attack in big groups of mains with adders, smoke screen etc. Order To Engage will hurt them a lot also.<br />
<br />
vs. ISB<br />
Just about the same as Ops. Attack all their pesky spies, Order To Engage them to death<br />
<br />
vs Hunt Down<br />
The spies are in there to cancel Visage. There are also 3 duel protection cards in there that should help out if they duel. If they aren't smart try to Out Of Commision a Vader early in the game if they lose one. If not, don't be afraid of Vader and keep fighting. If they use 2/2 Imperials use Scramble and that will teach them when it is combined with Test 2.<br />
<br />
vs. Big Blue/IAO<br />
If they use walkers early on stay in your interior sites and drain away while testing. When test two is on the table deploy scramble and battle the walker until they are no more because their pilots won't be drawing destiny. In space Landing Claw a destroyer and use Yoxgit to retrieve them. Order to Engage will help when Scramble is out and they don't want to battle.<br />
<br />
That is prety much it. The Stone Pile/Grimtaash trick is pretty nasty when using Grimtaash first then Stone Pile. Bacta Tank keeps your guys coming back and Don't Forget the Droids is for #'s protection.	 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
