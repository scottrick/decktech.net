Goo Nee Tay should be Draw Their Fire. Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
You should always start with Battle Plan to slow down the opponent's drains.<br />
<br />
I choose to use all the Dagobah sites rather than use other training destiny cards because it isn't *just* used for training. It still has a purpose after the training is done because it generates 1 force for me. If you'd rather use Luke's Backpack or Reflection that's fine with me.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of Hunt Down protection in this deck since I noticed it's starting to become rather prominent. I have 2 Courages and 2 Glancing Blows. Also, Out Of Commission can be used to place Vader out of play if you're really lucky.<br />
<br />
Use your Landing Claw wisely, as it is one of the more important cards in this deck. If it is canceled, fly the ship over to Dagobah and land either at the Bog Clearing (if you think you can retrieve the Claw with Draw Their Fire) or the Swamp (to sink the ship into your used pile).<br />
<br />
You are only training to Test 2, so after finishing testing go to your opponent's arena. Just battle, battle, battle. You should be able to beat up anything with an Imperial since you have 6 Eloms and Orrimaarko. If they are using an all-alien deck (say a S&V or COTVG deck), try to battle at the same site as Mara Jade if you can. If not, just use the Eloms as forfeit fodder. I think this deck should do well vs. anything thrown at it. Play smart and you will prevail. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
