<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>DPC Weekend Update posted by DeckTech on Tue Jul 16 2002 <br>So with both a DPC local in Atlanta, and a Master Series in Houston, it was quite a busy weekend for DPC and DeckTechers.<br>
<br>
First, both <b>Alan Denny</b> and <b>Adam Drake</b> did outstanding jobs.  Adam, one of premiere Event Organizers, can always be expected to deliver fantastic tournaments, but it was a great find to add Alan to our list of Co-ordinators.  DPC Houston was a big success to everyone who came, despite foul weather, flooding, detours, and West Nile Virus.  Big thanks to both of them, and the excellent job they did.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, <a href="http://www.strikezoneonline.com" target="x">Strike Zone</a> and our regular Atlanta Local hangout <a href="http://www.tandttoys.com"  target="x">TnT Toys</a> deserve props as well for their great hosting effort.<br>
<br>
Ok, with the thanks out of the way, let's see what happened.<br>
<br>
Of note, <b>Brian Hunter</b> wins another SWCCG DPC.  This is his third SWCCG DPC win, amazing.  He also wins the SWTCG tournament as well.<br>

Great job all winners here.  I'll get you up on the DPC board soon.<br>
