When it is up here it is true. The problem is that they never have th scoop. Somebody else allways beats them to it, so it has become nothing more than a confirmation site of info we already knew.
This has been different in the far past but it isn't so anymore. They also have a problem with the decks and articles that are not written by Juz or one of the other wizards. They don't have much decks or data of anybody else thats really recent.

Bad part is (and that warrants only 2 stars) that it NEVER has any fresh information. All the information on there has been leaked or has been released through other sources (read SM's who tease and breach security). Nothing is really ever really new of unsuspected.

Oh that is not really true the only things that ARE new to the site are the official memo's stating that a set is indeed delayed from its release date. (and even THAT is not totally unexpected :(  )

Sais enough I think.<BR>
