<B>the Lorax</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>just like to say, I have never seen people getting the wrong cards in packs.  my brother does have one Imp Class Star Destroyer that was miscut and is missing the bottom quarter of an inch or so, and has about a quarter of an inch of a dif. char. on the top, but, heck, that could be from an uncut sheet that someone decided to cut, for all we know. <BR>
<B>Kyp Durron</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>  Today I had another strange pulls experience.  Finished off the last 20 packs in a box of Death Star II.  There were 4-5 rares in each pack.  The wierd part is, the extra rares were, without exception, Light Side cards.  <BR>
<B>Douglas</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Well Anonymous Economist, I&#146;m sorry if I offended you but the truth is that Decipher are making a really good product and its a real shame to see such common occurences of mispackaging. Note my use of the word &quot;common&quot;, because it just happens too much. What my original point was is that it happens far too often and more care should be taken during every stage of the production and packaging, whoever controls it. <BR>
<B>Rogue Gunner</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Ive been the recepient of one of the so called &quot;hot boxes&quot; of reflections.  mine had 5 ls cloud city rares in every pack. <BR>
<B>Ooryl</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I got a box of Limited Premeire with the LS commons all replaced by LS rares.  That was alot of fun let me tell you. <BR>
<B>Unmoved Mover</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Mispackaging isn&#146;t always a bad thing.  I heard one guy get a Boushh in a Death Star pack, that&#146;s worth a good bit more than Death Star rares.  And one of my local store ended up with an entire case of Reflections that all had 4 foils apiece, I saw it myself!  People always talk up when they get screwed by mispackaging, you don&#146;t really hear that much about those who gain from it (though I&#146;m sure Decipher would be more than happy to replace those as well). :-) <BR>
<B>Phrim</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>One of my DSII boxes was really messed up. After opening the first box, my fingers were &#146;trained&#146; (Those who used to band and deliver papers know what I mean)
So, I felt the subtle difference on the second box. I started counting my packs, and I discovered I was getting anywhere from 9 to 15 cards per pack. Was I upset? Not at all. I was missing no rares, and I figured, if I get a ton of uncommons, cool, cause I often use many multiples. Now, as far as getting stuff like SE or Endor in packs, never, but I saw a guy pull an Endor or SE card a few weeks ago.

<B>Daeyel</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>fellas, if ya get a misspackage just let the big D know about it. Send in whatever was misspacked, and they will fix the error. I bought an entire box of endor with nothing but offcut rares, they had no border on the right side. i told em about it, and sent in the cards and got replacements. Ive also gotten a pack that had no rare, had the comic shop guy call customer service and they mailed me a new pack. This is one of the few things decipher is cool about. even though it probably shouldnt happen in the first place. <BR>

We love it! It&#146;s the best thing ever! We feel special when we pull an EJP pack with the wrong 2 cards, or get damaged cards in a pack! It&#146;s an incredible rush!!!  

What do you think, genius? Mispackaging isnt cool, but it happens. Deal. <BR>
<B>Anonymous Economist</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>  Agreed.  I don&#146;t know which stages of the whole process are handled by Decipher employees directly, but the miscuts, blanks, card stock, premium distribution errors, cards caught in the crimper, and 9-12 card packs all point to a quality-control problem that needs to be addressed.  I love what Decipher has been doing in the design stages recently, but someone needs to make sure these standards are maintained right up to shelving.   <BR>
<B>Douglas</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I&#146;ve been caught twice in the space of a couple of days. On Saturday I got a Sealed Deck that had no Tusken Canyon in it (and 2 Obsidian TIEs) and today I got a D*2 pack with a crimped corner. I&#146;ve also seen whole boxes of Hoth without rares and many Third Anthologies with doubles. I even saw one Star Trek second anthology with a black faced card as one of the premiums. Should Decipher be taking more care? <BR>
