It now seems that the rumors are true, as he was seen by several witnesses leaving the quarters of Junlaka, an openly admitted gay Ugnaught, early this morning. 
    'Well ya know', said Calrissian, 'I always knew there was something up with that guy. I remember one time we were in the gym and he was staring at my package. At first I wrote it off as genuine white curiosity about the immensity of the black genitalia, but when I saw his leering grin, I knew it was more.' 
    Most in the sprawling metropolis are happy for Lobot. Miner, Michelle Greenmeier, 'He deserves to have some fun with his life considering his background story. His implant was a cruel joke played on him in a fraternity. You see he is a music connoisseur of the highest order. When his brothers told him to try out a new wireless walkman he jumped at the chance. The next thing he knows, the 'headphones' burrow themselves into his brain stem and he's a cyborg! I hope he finds happiness with that Ugnaught. No one needs it more than he does.' 
    And apparently he is happier. The reclusive Lobot, who was thought by all as being mute, as well as gay, was seen openly singing, 'We've Only Just Begun' while he jumped and clicked his heels together in hallway 45H27. 
    We contacted Junlaka, Lobot's new lover for comment,  'Honey, Lo Lo an I just had a delightful time. When you get a few dozen Long Island Iced Teas in him he really lets loose. We hand fed each other olives and pigs feet. It was very romantic. Then we danced, and he sang to me. Did you know that he can sing his tight little ass off?!' Junlaka didn't want to get into any specifics about the remainder of their evening, but he did say this,  'Afterwards we had to freeze each other in carbonite to cool down. Kinda reminds me of that party we had here after Lando blew up that Death Star or whatever...' <BR>
