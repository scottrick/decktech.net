<B>neal</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Clear vs Coloured Back
Clear plastics are a weaker plastic...the seal between the layers is thinner in width.  Coloured back plastics are tougher and more durable and make the cards stand out more.  Clear plastics aren't as wide or as thick so your deck appears smaller than the wider and thicker coloured back plastics.  Also if you put the coloured back plastics in a pile with the open end facing you.  Because of the thickness of the plastics you can see the tips of the cards... place some white border cards into your deck...you'll see that you can pick them out easy when they're stacked.   Just noticed this the other day and set out in replacing my WB with black... hard to do though for premiere anyways... but thanks to foils it's all good :)

<B>RogueGunner</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>If you really want to cheat, you're gonna find a way. It doesn't help that some systems seem to be upside down (ls force icons on bottom of ds card) and my natural tendency is to flip them over. I play against my brother and I see him do that and I know it's a system. Anybody know the reason for that? (sites upside down) <BR>
<B>dparker</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Some people do cheat.  One tournement, there was one person who had some of his cards facing in opposite directions.
When I asked the td to look, all of those cards were sites......coincidence, I think not.  I do not even play with sleeves, believe it or not.
But then again I do not give a @#$% about the condition of my cards, as long as they are not marked, or heavily creased.
I do not have too cheat to win games, and if you do, well you suck...I am bored at school... so i am just ranting here.
so dont mind me....... <BR>

You can look at the top of your cards and tell which cards are upsidedown, I have seen magic players get kicked out of tournaments for this, even the most hounest people I know in this world. I to wish they would allow black sleves again, because I want to use the new blue sleves, those sleves KICK ASS!!! <BR>
<B>Player</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I use clear sleeves and I can still tell you what every card in my deck is just by looking at its back for a couple seconds. <BR>
<B>Sharky</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>wow, that actually makes sense.  thanks rayc, that was the best anyone has ever explained that to me. <BR>
<B>neal</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>As it was explained to me by Marcus Certa at the regional last year, the opaque card sleeves are too easy to mark. You can put a little crease in the back with your fingernail to trace the card through the deck. Also, isn't the rule now that insert ed cars must be face down? If the sleeves are different, it would be too easy to track the insert. If they are the same, you can't tell when the insert comes up. I know, I know -- not too many broken hearts over that one...   <BR>
<B>rayc</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Why are they illegal? I've got them on my decks, because I'd feel stupid ruining an expensive rare in a game, and some of my cards are marked (got run over - don't ask). <BR>
<B>dparker</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I agree with you here Neal. The card back thing is a great idea. Though, it might mess with people. I, myself, am one of those 'neat' players. Everything has to be in order on table and it annoys the f*cking @#$% outta me whn cards are just thrown there. I like them to be parallel to the end of the tabel....well, it's a sick habit, but I have it. So like, having card backs mirrored would irritate me if I picky one up and it's upside down or rightside up...depends oon how my deck is facing. But it's still a great idea...and the black sleeves should def. be braught back! I found out about those like a few days after Decipher made them illegal....I was piiiiiissed :O) Those things are so kewl! <BR>
<B>Sorsceror</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Yeah. I always wondered why they did it the way they did it. If every playing card company in the world does it, why would ccg card makers miss it?  <BR>
<B>rayc</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>at the last tournament i went to (unsanctioned of course) a newer player got annoyed with me because some of my cards were facing the wrong way.  i was like 'huh, oh, you mean the backs are mixed up, sorry'.  i think he thought i was cheating, which i wouldn't even be smart enough to do anyway.  so i got to thinking about real cards where marking cards can get you killed not just disqualified and of course, real cards have backs that can't be orientated a certain way.  they usually have some kind of mirroring pattern.  so stroke of genius here... why doesn't decipher or wotc start doing that!  duh.  all they'd have to do is make the little symbol smaller and print it upside down in a mirror image.  not exactly genius is it.  also, if decipher would quit being ridiculous and allow black bordered card sleeves this wouldn't be a problem(i think they should be required), but i still think they should just print the backs in an opposable manner.  Oh, and not now, but for future games.  see, for once something where no one can argue with me, this is a good idea! <BR>
