<B>Someguy</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>you guys probably don't know the origin of this, it was from like the first couple weeks we started dt.  we used to have a thing where you could vote for the best commons of sets, and it would rank them.  it was a way for us to learn how to use this php3 language to set up databases.  anyhow, droid merchant was just marching along, and endor had just come out.  also, if you don't know, david is the one that made the maelstrom deck.  so checking out endor, we just laughed at emperor's new order because it was cancelled by a common, yub yub.  and if you ever played maelstrom, a lost interrupt might as well have been used.  so i made this little write up, which i have around here somewhere, and put it up there.  droid merchant was immediately voted #1.  and like three days later, it was errated.  it's probably just a coincidence, but anyway, 'the freak' must have thought it was not. hehe, yeah i still got it, here it is
<p><b>Droid Merchant</b> - A deploy for one character with a decent ability and forfeit. But wait a minute, you can also use him to activate about 20 force a turn and retrieve up to 9 force. Holy Hooded Hero! This little unknown from Tatooine caused the errata of both Spaceport Speeders and Hydroponics Station. A no brainer for the list. </p> <BR>

Hmmmmm... Maybe we could all vote for, say, Ewok Tribesman as the best Endor common, and see what happens...
<P>Just to see, everybody put 4 ETs in your decks from now on to see how long it takes Decipher to errata it!!! <BR>

<B>neal</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Wow, surprise, Decipher pays attention to players' concerns about cards.  How do you think a card like Crush the Rebellion came about? People complained long enough about how powerful Revo was, the SWCCG guys took a look at it and made an appropriate counter.  I just don't get how someone can imply there's something wrong with Decipher doing this.... <BR>

<B>neal</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>This title actually is true.  I remember when he told me about it.  Justin regularly reads this site, as do many of us here, but that is all I can say. <BR>
<B>Can't Say</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I agree with Ozzy. They erratad the wrong card initially. Maybe know they can reverse it. To much post-Se errata here. No wonder EP1 will be a new game - no old baggage!<BR>
<B>Rob</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>It doesn't matter why they erratad it, did Decipher find out about it on decktech, that's interesting to me.  If you thought it was hard to beat, try it before hydroponics station was erratad, i've been playing against it since then. i only took it down maybe twice.  Once pulled off a evazan's blaster rifle/lasted droid and killed like 15 characters twice.  The other grabbed speeders with a there'll be hell to play first turn, dark waters/imperial decree and waited him out.  It's definitely improved since then though.  But these guys who are saying they;ll win gencon with it now, man, i just don't see it.  Spaceport Speeders has been around a long time, and it's only been marginally good till the merchants.<BR>
<B>Neal</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>they errataed it because it was broken there was no way anyone could beat it<BR>
<B>God</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I have it on a very good source that Decipher DOES regularly check decktech, although I don't know why.  I didn't realize how powerful Droid Merchant was until reading the write up in the voting section.  More than likely, Decipher did not either until seeing it there.<BR>
<B>Tim Webb</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>Maybe it's a possibility but truthfully, I believe that Decipher had this errata worked out a long time ago, but they chose the most akward and spontaneous time to release it. Maybe they just wanted to see how well the Endor counter worked before they errata'd it.<BR>
<B>Alan</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>The errata did come as a suprise and at a most coincidental time. :)<BR>
<B>David</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>I said long ago that Decipher errated the wrong card when they hit Spaceport Speeders. It took them many, many months to realize the error.<BR>
<B>Ozymandias</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>If you read the comments about the droid merchant on the SE Commons page, you begin to see how powerfull it is. Once they saw how popular it was becoming... that was all there was to it.<BR>
