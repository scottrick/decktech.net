In addition, most of the prior regions received a couple new magi along with some creatures, spells, and relics to add to their arsenal. I will look at each region in general, along with some specific cards. This may be a long review and you may wish to scroll down to the region that most interests you.<br />
<br />
	Arderial<br />
<br />
This region receives another xyx, more card draw, and two alternate magi. A fair set of new cards. Overall, I would rate these cards 3 out of 5. The alternate magi deserve a closer look and are two of the power cards for Arderial in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Arderian Adept, alternate Shimmer. At the end of your turn, if your magi has no energy, return a creature in play to the owner&#8217;s hand and add that creatures energy to the controlling magi. If this is your magi, you can&#8217;t add above the creatures starting energy. This should not be a problem. As it turns out, there is an Arderial/d&#8217;Resh illusionary creature, Sandstorm Orshaa, introduced in this set as well. If nothing else, you can use the benefits of the Storm Shield without the extreme risk of remaining at zero energy on your magi, just by processing the effect of the shield first.<br />
<br />
Aula, Mindseeker. Is there some sort of alliance between Arderial and Orothe? A dual region magi, the Arderial/Orothe control deck just got a strong boost. You use her power to discard a spell from your hand to draw cards equal to half the spells energy cost. In return, you cannot draw anymore cards this turn. She also starts with Typhoon, an eight energy cost Orothe spell. Those expensive Arderial, or Orothe, spells found a new friend. With an energize of four, this Aula probably won&#8217;t be playing many of them. You&#8217;ll probably want to either increase her energize, or draw lots of cards and proceed to your second magi.<br />
<br />
	Bograth<br />
<br />
The region of the small creature swarm receives a mix of new small creatures, three magi, and some spells and relics. There is more effects and powers that grow your creatures, which gives this region a solid boost. I was impressed with several of the creatures, and I would rate these cards 4 out of 5. As tempting as it might be to look a bit more at each creature and a couple of the magi, we&#8217;ll take a further look at just the Swamp Moga and Ninibom.<br />
<br />
Swamp Moga. No, this not a Kybar&#8217;s Teeth creature. A great addition to the swarm, you spend two so that all your creatures remove two additional energy when they attack. A five energy creature, it should have staying power and will help you cut through invulnerability even if you don&#8217;t have Rayje&#8217;s Sword in play. With this creature, Bograth gets another boost to their offensive capability versus large creatures. Be afraid of this one.<br />
<br />
Ninibom. While not perhaps the best Core/Bograth magi, this magi has two different options. If played as one of your standard three magi, then you have a magi that energizes for seven and starting energy of eight. If Baa, Wiep, and Grahnna are your magi in that order, you can play Nimibom as a fourth magi with an energize of two. While I had to the humor explained to me, it seems that the names of these four magi in this order is the same as the universal greeting in the Transformers Movie. If nothing else, this is the first card that allows an actual fourth magi in the stack.<br />
<br />
	Cald<br />
<br />
While I have read that this set revitalizes the Cald creature deck and makes it a viable, I don&#8217;t feel that there was any real problem with it previously. Yet, I do agree that this set makes the creatures much stronger. Another ergar, useful in its own right, and two alternate magi all improve the creature decks. These cards rate a 5 of 5. Whether you play creatureless or not, there is something here for nearly every Cald player. We&#8217;ll look at the alternate Magam and Everburning Wick.<br />
<br />
Magam, Flamesmith. The first creature you play each turn gains two energy, while the first opposing creature played loses two. Makes you want to play a creature each turn, doesn&#8217;t it? A little free energy never hurt too much. Considering how easy it is for Cald creatures to burn into oblivion, its nice to give your creatures little extra room. We need to add in that this Magam pulls Gorgle&#8217;s Glasses, and you have access to one of the great draw engines for the region. Creature decks are looking better already.<br />
<br />
Everburning Wick. Short fuse, whenever one of your cards is discarded by an opposing card, discard one energy from that magi. Really short fuse, if you have no creatures in play at the beginning of your turn, you may discard Everburning Wick to discard five energy from an opposing creature. While the new Magam adds an extra boost for the creatures, this relic adds extra power to creatureless, or nearly creatureless, Cald.<br />
<br />
	Core<br />
<br />
While you get four new magi to play with, you may want to make sure you have a copy of Qwade from Awakening handy. Another Naroom magi has fallen, and we see some more creatures playable by other regions. Some interesting new tricks possible, but nothing seems to really glow in the dark, these cards get a 3 out of 5. We&#8217;ll take a closer look at Harror, Nightstalker and Haunt.<br />
<br />
Harror, Nightstalker. No starting cards, and you wouldn&#8217;t want them either. Magi can&#8217;t play their starting cards due to her effect. They can still get them, though. As long as you&#8217;re not facing another Core deck, you energize for seven. In the stories, she escaped capture in the Sands of d&#8217;Resh. So, it is no real surprise to find that a number of d&#8217;Resh cards have bonuses for playing a magi&#8217;s starting cards. She opposes this.<br />
<br />
Haunt. Play this on an opposing creature. When the creature is discarded, you play it ignoring costs and regional restrictions. Great spell. In gameplay, though, I have seen it virtually thrown away. Several players have cast it on a creature they expect to be discarded in three or four turns. This gives their opponent time and options to deal with the spell, including a simple Beam of Light. My recommendation is to play it on a creature that will be discarded very shortly, preferably, by the end of your turn. Powerful potential in this spell.<br />
<br />
	Sands of d&#8217;Resh<br />
<br />
While I have been frequently referring to this new region simply as d&#8217;Resh, the Sands of d&#8217;Resh is a new region getting involved in the general story from a land of rolling sand, burning sunlight, and frigid nights. In other words, welcome to the desert.<br />
<br />
Being a new region, though we did see a few teasers in the prior set, it might take a bit sum it up. We see a whole swarm of illusionary creatures, oracles appear, and the olums step up to the plate. Don&#8217;t be surprised if a d&#8217;Resh player plays with a creature from your deck, swaps creatures you have in play with another in your hand, or plays a ten or eleven point creature for dirt cheap. As it is, these cards get a 4 out of 5. Since it is a new region, we&#8217;ll look at a magi, two creatures, a spell, and a relic.<br />
<br />
Nashiq. Once per turn, you can use her power to shuffle a card from your discard pile back into your deck. Until the end of your turn, you can play any copies of that card for three less to a minimum of one. Even with a low energize of four, this magi is surprisingly powerful. In other words, with careful planning, she can play normal creatures almost as if they were illusionary, and illusionary creatures easily for dirt cheap. Add in the bonus for using her power on the more expensive relics and spells, and this magi might be a real danger to any opposition.<br />
<br />
Sand Hyren. First, you get a discount of two energy of all the starting cards you play, to a minimum of one energy to play the card. Second, you can play Core cards as if they were d&#8217;Resh. Drajan starts with this hyren, should you wish to use the second effect. The savings on starting cards can make a difference. The more starting cards you play, the more you&#8217;ll save.<br />
<br />
Nemsa. You can play one Nemsa, from your hand, for free whenever you play one of your d&#8217;Resh magi&#8217;s starting cards. Nemsa can&#8217;t attack this turn if played using this effect. The second part of the effect prevents this creature from being over the top, should you or your opponent decide to Sandshape or Warrior&#8217;s Boots a starting card in before the attack step.<br />
<br />
Sunburn. Play it on a creature. Whenever that creature loses energy, it loses two more. Once the creature is discarded, you can discard one from your d&#8217;Resh magi to place it back in your hand. Great spell. The possibilities are nearly endless. This spell can work wonders with Crushing Sands, Amulet of Sand, Warrior Olum, Darbok, and Izmer to name a few. A very devastating spell if used wisely. As warning to those who use this spell, do not confuse this with invulnerability. It does not reduce the damage your creatures might receive in return.<br />
<br />
Sand Cape. If you have fewer cards in your hand than any opponent, you may play one d&#8217;Resh creature from your discard pile during the play creature step. With a few powers discarding cards from your hand, or against an opposing deck that draws lots of cards, you can now chose to replay one creature from your discard pile.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s a few terms you&#8217;ll want to remember from d&#8217;Resh.<br />
<br />
Illusionary - special creatures that have a starting energy nearly twice their cost and cannot attack magi. They don&#8217;t count as being in play when determining if the magi is defeated.<br />
<br />
Recurring - special creatures that when a player reveals their d&#8217;Resh magi, discard one energy to place one recurring creature from the discard pile back in the hand.<br />
<br />
Oracle - there are seven different oracles. If the controller has all seven in play during their energize step, then they can defeat an opposing magi using Risha&#8217;s effect. Risha, a magi, is the seventh oracle.<br />
<br />
	Kybar&#8217;s Teeth<br />
<br />
While there are quite a few who thoroughly love this region of large creatures, I have found this region to be somewhat challenged on the practical side. However, this set looks like it will fix, or allow a player to overcome, some of weaknesses of the teeth. A great mix of creatures, magi, and relics, these cards get a 5 out of 5. We&#8217;ll take a look at Celebrated Hero and Gogor&#8217;s Spade.<br />
<br />
Celebrated Hero, alternate Gogor. He loses some of his starting energy, but he now energizes for seven. A dual region magi, Underneath/Kybar&#8217;s teeth, his power allows him to restore a burrowed or illusionary creature to their starting energy in exchange for your normal draw step. Since he starts with Gogor&#8217;s Spade, this shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a problem should you choose to do so. Between his energize and his power, the teeth get a much needed boost. Not only can keep he those large creatures fighting longer, but Gogor should also be able to play them more often.<br />
<br />
Gogor&#8217;s Spade. All your of creatures gain the following effect: draw a card when they defeat an opposing creature in an attack. This Underneath/Kybar&#8217;s Teeth relic gives both regions something they could really use, an efficient draw engine. Some of us experimented with Cleanse and the Chaos Plith and found this to work. Now with one relic, I can treat all my creatures to that effect.<br />
<br />
	Nar<br />
<br />
If the new set is going to bring us the desert, why not bring the cold too. Instead of scorching sunlight, and frigid nights, we just freeze all day and all night long. It looks like the invaders everyone was whispering about may be these people coming across on ice.<br />
<br />
Like d&#8217;Resh, we did see a few teasers in the prior set. Yet, many of us were still left wondering what this mysterious new region would do. Well, it&#8217;s time for us to freeze. All the powers on frozen cards cost one more, and a frozen magi has to pay a penalty of one for their spells. A good number of their creatures get extra bonuses for being so frigid. Nar also has a lot of cards that relate to opposing relics. Heavy on your relics? Nar could be your worst nightmare. Other than the theme with relics, this region is fairly dependent on rare cards. As such, these cards get a 3 out of 5. Since it is a new region, we&#8217;ll look at a magi, two creatures, a spell, and a relic.<br />
<br />
Laranel, the Ice Queen. Although she only has a starting energy of eight, this icy magi has an impressive energize. Like most of the Nar magi with high energize rates, she has a built-in extnalty of one for non-Universal, non-Nar cards. Her first effect, though, requires her opponent to discard one energy from their magi whenever they use a spell or power that targets her or one of her creatures. Combine with a frozen environment, and you could really punish those decks that use a lot of powers.<br />
<br />
Garlak. A five point creature, at the beginning of your turn you choose a creature and discard one energy from it. If the creature is frozen discard an additional two energy. Since it is an effect, a burrow deck will hate this creature since it won&#8217;t count against the limit of two energy per turn from spells, powers, and attacks. On the downside, if your opponent has no creatures in play, then you might find yourself discarding that three energy from one of your own.<br />
<br />
Korul. Whenever this creature attacks, discard energy from the opposing creature equal to the number of relics controlled by the defending player before energy is removed. Now, if you could only give relics to your opponent... as it is, as long as the defender is light on the relics, it shouldn&#8217;t hurt too much. Relic heavy decks, though... beware.<br />
<br />
Crystalize. Attach this spell to a creature. The chosen creature cannot attack. Draw a card when this spell is discarded. Nar has several powerful attack options. By forcing an opposing creature to sit there and wait its turn to defend, Nar can gain the upper hand. A good spell, it gives an element of control.<br />
<br />
Dreamdrain Charm. Reduce each magi&#8217;s energize rate for all the spells and relics they have in play. At the beginning of each turn, that player can discard all of their spells and relics to discard this relic. Keep that second part in mind. Are you willing to sacrifice all your spells and relics? I saw a shadow geyser deck energize for zero because they didn&#8217;t want to lose their Corrupt, several relics, and two geysers plus Awakening. The Nar player used that time to build up plenty of energy and brutally tore up the Core deck once they were ready.<br />
<br />
If there is any term you&#8217;ll want to remember from Nar, it would be &#8220;frozen.&#8221; As stated earlier, all powers on frozen cards cost one more, and spells cost frozen magi one additional. Fortunately, most of their cards that can cause these conditions only effect a selection of card types, such as creatures. As far as I have seen, only the relic Essence of Frost actually freezes all cards while it is in play.<br />
<br />
	Naroom<br />
<br />
With three alternate magi, a good selection of creatures, and powerful relics, this region continues to be a strong contender. It is a wonder why Core is fairing so well, sometimes. Though, I admit, that with Naroom&#8217;s power coming up to this set, I can&#8217;t blame Core for focusing effort into corrupting this region first. It seems that the process is working both ways, though. These cards get a 4 out of 5. For this review, we&#8217;ll look at the new Yaki and Forest Wudge.<br />
<br />
Yaki, Core Stalker. In the story, Yaki was touched by Hrada and was tainted. Yet, he delivered a serious beating to Warrada and Hrada until he was betrayed by Evu. The card actually reflects this, which I was hoping to see. Yaki can play Core cards ignoring regional restrictions and penalties. However, he can only play Naroom, Universal, or Core cards. His double strike has been replaced with the ability to add two energy to an attacking creature, or four if it is attacking a Core creature. At the end of your attack step, discard all your creature that you added this energy to. And, if that wasn&#8217;t enough, all of your Core cards can now effect your Naroom creatures. Like Sorrowing Ogar, this Yaki cannot be played in a magi stack with Core magi.<br />
<br />
Forest Wudge, alternate Wudge. When you play this creature, if your opponent is Naroom or a Naroom shadow, draw a card. When your opponent plays a creature, add one energy to this one, an additional one if the played creature was Naroom. Not surprisingly, Naroom shadow magi can play this creature ignoring regional penalties. It may or may not grow as fast as the original Wudge, though Naroom usually has no problem growing their creatures anyways. This creature is not only a powerful ally for Naroom, it may also be its worst nightmare.<br />
<br />
	Orothe<br />
<br />
The masters of control, Orothe seems to be lacking much of the same in this new set. Often played with a relic heavy deck, they do see some cards that will help out including a creature, relic, and magi. In fact, we see a non-Core dual magi. However, these cards get a 2 out of 5. Very few cards for Orothe impressed me in this set. While the new Aula has great possibility, I already covered that with Arderial, so we&#8217;ll look at Cawh and Karse.<br />
<br />
Cawh. While many applaud this giant creature, my friends and I took a second look and opted to leave it in the binder until we find a real use for it. Still, lets look at what it does. It&#8217;s first effect allows it to lose three less in attacks, but other cards cannot prevent Cawh from losing energy. Other than attacks, there is no need for your opponent to play Rayje&#8217;s Sword against this creature. That might be okay. The second effect says if your opponent tries to discard Cawh or return it to your hand while Cawh still has energy, discard six energy from Cawh instead. Plus, opposing cards cannot gain control of this creature. This effect is awesome. Add in that it&#8217;s a fifteen point creature, it looks good, but expensive. It&#8217;s the third effect that makes my friends and I debate whether this creature is worth playing. Cawh can only be played during the play creatures step (no summoning or dream twisting), you cannot play other creatures while Cawh is in play, and you cannot play Cawh while you have other creatures in play. Being unable to summon or dream twist the Cawh out into play shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a bother, but sort of cuts out some of the fun of Orothe. Cawh&#8217;s weaknesses? Many and varied, including the infamous Rayje&#8217;s Sword. We&#8217;ll also throw in Inferno Xyx, Storm Cloud, Ambush, Dessicate, and Gorgle&#8217;s Curse to name a few. This doesn&#8217;t even touch on combinations that could eat a Cawh. And, almost all the options we could easily think of (and most are in our varied decks because their just plain good no matter what we take on) cost one third what Cawh does. The new, smaller Orothe creatures might serve you better than Cawh.<br />
<br />
Karse. A new magi, we see more influence of the war between Cald and Orothe. Although, it is interesting that while he pulls Cawh which would be weak against Cald spells and powers, he also pulls the Hunter Jile, an anti-Core creature. If an opposing magi is Cald, increase his base energize of five by two, in other words up to seven. As a second effect, all of your Orothe and Universal cards that cost seven or more, cost three less to play. This magi has great potential. Typhoon would cost five, Giant Parathin for seven, Megathan costs five, and you could even play a Monarch Hyren for six. Yes, his effect would apply to that Cawh as well.<br />
<br />
It is mostly because of the various magi that I didn&#8217;t rate this latest addition to Orothe even worse.<br />
<br />
	Paradwyn<br />
<br />
Like many regions, we get three new magi, several creatures, some spells, and a couple relics. Once again, Liriel&#8217;s Cape experienced a misprint. At least the MRP wording is correct. Both the dreamwarp and stalk themes get a boost in this set. Although, it looks like stalking gets the majority of the boost and should become a more stable and deadly theme. These cards get a 4 out of 5. For this review, we&#8217;ll look more at Kiersta and Kwup.<br />
<br />
Kiersta. A new magi that apparently has fallen asleep on a vine swing. With a good starting energy and a standard energize of five, its her effect that makes her stand out. Basically, every other turn you can add five energy to Kiersta if you are willing to skip your attack step that turn. Add in that she pulls a Tropical Jumbor that grows two every turn it doesn&#8217;t attack, and that might be a ton of free energy. Kiersta looks to be a real contender among the new magi.<br />
<br />
Kwup. A four point creature with a power to spend one and discard three from a stalked creature. Plus, it&#8217;s a jungle stalker (a few magi start with one jungle stalker). A great new addition for the stalk deck. A stalk deck usually previously had most of its power locked into the attack step, this gives it some power during the powers/spells/relics step.<br />
<br />
	Underneath<br />
<br />
Apparently the war with Core has spread to Underneath as well. We see this in a new anti-Core creature. As mentioned with Kybar&#8217;s Teeth, Gogor gets an alternate version, and a new relic improves card draw for both of the regions. Add in the Rabid Bisiwog that many of us recall from Trygar in Awakening, as well as an actual card for his will, and this set is exciting for Underneath. These cards get a 5 out of 5. We&#8217;ll look at Sarazen Keeper and Rabid Bisiwog.<br />
<br />
Sarazen Keeper. These creatures like each other sarazen and hyren. There are two powers. First, if you have a hyren in play, you can add one energy to each of your sarazen. Second, if you have at least two sarazens in play, draw a card. A sarazen deck mixed with hyren might be something to try.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bisiwog. When Rabid Bisiwog attacks, it can remove its energy from two creatures simultaneously. This makes this little creature a real threat. Fortunately for us, it doesn&#8217;t like to be burrowed. If it is burrowed, discard it. Still, an Underneath deck could use Terrorize with this  creature to devastating effect, essentially destroying two creatures with the power of one. Korremar and Underneath Shadow magi can play Rabid Bisiwog.<br />
<br />
	Universal<br />
<br />
No new magi here. Rayje appeared in the last set. We do see some new spells and relics, as well as the Baby Hyren. A very small selection of new cards for this region. Then again, these are cards that all the other regions will be using. These cards get a 3 out of 5. Here, we&#8217;ll look at Spirit of Rayje and Reality Anchor.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rayje. As an opposing card discards all the energy from your magi, you can play this spell to add three energy to your magi. This spell can prevent your magi from being defeated. I have seen battles stretched out just because of this card. However, it is limited in its use. After the initial text of the spell, it says that you can only play Spirit of Rayje three times per game. This card may be most useful when your own last magi and giving it all you got to win.<br />
<br />
Reality Anchor. This relic has two effects. If your opponents are drawing more than four cards per turn, or ruining your day by searching their deck or discard pile for cards, then this may be the relic for you. It eliminates the ability of players to search for cards, and limits the card draw to a total of four per turn. This effect applies to you, too. Second, if a spell, power, or effect chooses your magi, you can discard this relic from play to negate it. You could look at it as a variant of the Climbing Staff. There are several cards in this set designed to penalize or slow down decks with impressive draw engines, this just happens to be one of them. You can think of it as a speed limit. Sometimes, all it takes is to slow things down a bit.<br />
<br />
	Weave<br />
<br />
Did you know that Wence, the Wanderer was skilled with the Weave? Well, not only is he Naroom/Weave magi, we also see a new magi mocking the pacifism of the Weave. Strangely, that same magi has a defensive effect to go with that quote. Some interesting new creatures, including a Stumbling Junjertrug, and a couple relics that might be good options for a variety of deck ideas. We see more of Weave pacifism in this set than anything else, which may easily be expected. These cards get a 3 out of 5. We&#8217;ll look more at Weave Seed and Bo&#8217;Ahsa&#8217;s Shield.<br />
<br />
Weave Seed. This is not a pacifist&#8217;s spell. Spend five, add seven energy to a Weave creature. That creature must attack this turn if able, and can attack an additional time. For those of us that play an aggressive Weave deck, this spell is a great new addition. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve put in my deck, yet. My Weave deck is currently a creature feature, and probably will remain one for a month or two yet (some of the local kids have a fascination with it, and I guess that I keep it together to keep them happy... although it also know as a very &#8220;mean&#8221; deck).<br />
<br />
Bo&#8217;Ahsa&#8217;s Shield. While this relic costs two energy, it gives any of your Weave magi the ability to use Weave Tactics, something only Bo&#8217;Ahsa could do before. Or, you could Bo&#8217;Ahsa another copy of the effect as well. Simply put, once per turn, when one of your Weave creatures is attacked, you may choose to have one of your other Weave creatures defend instead. You&#8217;ll have to discard one energy from your magi to use the effect from the relic. It&#8217;s not uncommon for a Weave deck to force the opponent to attack, only to have them attack everything in a pattern that destroys the entire defense anyways. This will allow you to use your wall of creatures better.<br />
<br />
	Summary<br />
<br />
After all of these sections, I want to assure you that I do play all of the regions. While I am new to d&#8217;Resh and Nar, as these regions just came out, I believe that I play a fair game with most of the regions. This review was made using that knowledge. I know there will be those that disagree with my views. One point I expect possible arguments is the rating of Orothe and Cawh in particular. While I commend those that build and use working Cawh decks, it is still not a creature I will recommend for the majority of players.<br />
<br />
Don&#8217;t think I am depressed by this set in the least. In fact, it has excited me a great deal. This review was meant to be as honest as I could about Voice of the Storms. It was also inspired by another review I read, which seemed to be lacking anything in depth. As a side effect, it has made this a rather lengthy article.<br />
<br />
