This is a difficult question to answer. Perhaps the answer can best be found after examining some of Cald&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge is how I attempt to survive Cald when I must face off against it. By understanding what my opponent is likely going to be able to do, I try to present the problem that is difficult for them to solve. It isn&#39;t guaranteed to work, still I will take the better odds it can present me as I try to survive the burn.<br />
<br />
In my case, I learned some of what Cald can do by both playing Cald and playing against Cald. When it comes to burning, there are three basic ways Cald can apply the burn. Cald either burn a single large creature, burn massive number of creatures all at once, or burn with a vast number of spells and powers for smaller individual amounts until the same end is achieved as the other two methods.<br />
<br />
To burn a big creature, Cald can turn to Dessicate or Storm Cloud, perhaps combined with Scroll of Fire. Those of us who play more strictly within region can find Greater Vaal fun, Inferno Xyx effective, and Blast Gloves combined with Gorgle&#39;s Gift satisfying. I recall that during Awakening, it was Sulfurous Spirit and Blast Gloves that I used to deal with larger creatures. I didn&#39;t really like the Sulfurous Spirit combo that much because of how much card resources I used to deal with one opposing creature as it also cost me a creature, or a third card, too. Still, I did use it frequently to give my deck the ability to hit some of those bigger creatures.<br />
<br />
Now that we have established that big creatures can be hit with burn, how about vast numbers? That can burn easily too. Flame Geyser, Wildfire, Core Grag, and even Boil give Cald a strong basis to burn unlimited numbers of opposing creatures in one strike. This gives Cald some real solid burn that can destroy vast swarms of creatures. This can be really devastating to an opponent as they&#39;ve probably spent a good amount of their energy and available cards in hand to accomplish their swarm of critters.<br />
<br />
Both of these tactics seem to round a strong Cald deck in themselves. There are those of us that apply burn tactics but turn to a third approach to try and avoid some of the weaknesses present in the first two mentioned here. While I do apply some bits of these other burn mechanics, you are far more likely to see Brushfire and Ergar powering the burn when someone plays this type of Cald. This approach may mix in some of the heavy hitting powers mentioned already, however it focuses on hitting with smaller and more controlled bits of burn that can be used repeatedly. In this approach, to hit bigger creatures, you simply burn them little by little, sometimes burning the behemoth for all those little bits in a single turn if the burn deck can pull it off. The same approach is easily adapted to swarms. Instead of using the repeated burn to hit a single creature, the repetition is applied to one creature after another burning as many as possible.<br />
<br />
Do not be discouraged. With all this burn, big creatures and multiple creatures don&#39;t seem to stand a chance. These very strengths can be exploited. As I stated in the beginning, it is no guarantee of success, but understanding these strengths of Cald can help you deal with it. Cald can take more skill to play than you might first guess. This is why it is possible to try and exploit some of these same strengths of the burn.<br />
<br />
The first thing you will need to beat Cald burn is a willingness to be defeated. Without this, you will not take the risks necessary to win. This should not be confused with taking foolish risks. Instead, I recommend taking calculated risks.<br />
<br />
To make a calculated risk against a Cald burn deck, you first need to understand the strengths and basic mechanics of Cald. The next task before you is to pay attention to how your opponent is burning your stuff.<br />
<br />
Did your opponent spend a three card combo to burn your one big creature? Are they specializing in this? Just how many bigger creatures can they get in a turn? This is the key to the first calculated risk.<br />
<br />
Can your deck throw down more than one large creature at a time? I have sometimes presented two creatures over six energy each to my opponent in the hopes that they could only get one but not both. This doesn&#39;t always pan out, even if they get both it could always mean that they&#39;ve expended all or most of the cards they had in hand which could hit bigger creatures easily. Any creature with more than six energy can qualify as a creature that needs a heavier hitting mechanic to get. The more cards they used from their hand to get those big creatures, the better it can be for you. Gorgle&#39;s Glasses can only net one card for the creature that is burned into oblivion. If it costs them more than one card to do it, then it can be that much harder for them to repeat the performance for the next creature or their next turn. In this manner, you are intentionally playing to the strength of burning large creatures.<br />
<br />
The goal is either to have your opponent burn up their resources that can achieve this goal, or have one or more of your creatures survive to your next turn. If my opponent is playing Wildfire or Flame Geyser, than this calculated risk begins to look great. I already know they&#39;ve built their deck to handle numbers of creatures. Can their deck handle creatures too big to be eliminated by either of those spells? Once I&#39;ve taken this risk, I expect to receive my answer on my opponent&#39;s next turn.<br />
<br />
Is your opponent burning several creatures at one time with a single spell or power? Are they specializing in this? Apparently we are looking for the second Cald strength now. Like the key to the first calculated risk, the answer determines the challenge we want to create for our opponent.<br />
<br />
Now, if you know your opponent will burn large numbers of small creatures easily, you probably want to challenge their ability to burn larger creatures. On the other hand, if they just tossed down a Flame Geyser and burned everything you had, this just might be the time to play out several creatures. There is certainly risk that they can repeat the performance. This danger is especially strong if you see Gorgle&#39;s Glasses in play. The more creatures they eliminate with a single spell or power, the better the card advantage your opponent will net, and thus increasing the odds that they can repeat the performance.<br />
<br />
If your opponent isn&#39;t burning vast numbers of creature with a single spell or power, then presenting them the challenge of burning a number of creatures instead can become a solid choice. The more targets you present, the better the challenge. A Bograth swarm is often the extreme example of this form of challenge. The Bograth magi plays out so many small creatures that if the Cald player doesn&#39;t come up with something to hit all them at once quickly then they may find that the swarm slips beyond anything they could dream of burning away. This simply means that any deck that throws out more targets than the Cald player can burn each turn can try and go after that opening.<br />
<br />
These two calculated risks can be combined. If you can manage it, end your turn with four or more creatures with at least or more of them finishing with six energy or more. You are challenging your Cald opponent to choose between going after multiple creatures with a single card, or to go after the larger creature(s) instead. You essentially asking your opponent the question, Can you get all of them?<br />
<br />
Now that I&#39;ve shared the two basic risks I am suggesting that you ought to be willing to make, I want to clarify that just presenting these challenges is not enough. Do you have a plan for the creature(s) that survive? I will not answer this. Instead, I will simply try and illustrate why you need a plan for the survivor(s).<br />
<br />
To illustrate why it is important to have a plan of action for surviving creatures, I will use the only nearly creatureless deck I&#39;ve built as an example. I built the deck anticipating that I could not burn all the creatures I wanted to all the times I would want to. In other words, I built the deck knowing that my deck would not be able to answer those two major challenges. So what was my plan? Make the creatures that survive sit there and wait until I could burn them into oblivion. I loaded the deck with Firefly Amulet and Firefly Swarm. If I used these two cards correctly, I anticipated that I could get the surviving creatures to not attack my undefended magi. I had a plan to defend my magi from the creatures I couldn&#39;t get. Did it work? Yes. I even used that Cald deck in a local tournament and placed first. Only one person defeated both of my first two magi, and it was because he didn&#39;t need to attack to eliminate the energy from my defenseless magi. If he had been able to get in another of those non-attacks, he would&#39;ve defeated me.<br />
<br />
The point of my illustration isn&#39;t to suggest that you find some other way outside of attacks to get your opponent&#39;s magi. What I want you to understand is that you do not want to play like I actually forced my opponents to play in that tournament. Please, do not make the choice to sit there and wait for them to find a way to burn the challenges you present them. Are you going to attack? Is there a useful power or effect on your creature(s)? What will you gain from your surviving creature? That is the challenge you must answer for yourself after your Cald opponent answers the challenge you choose to give them. You can pre-plan some of your answers as you build your deck and as you play out the challenge you present your opponent.<br />
<br />
Now, someone might wonder about the third method of playing Cald that I mentioned. The two basic challenges still apply. While the third method hopes to be flexible enough to answer either of the two basic challenges, it too can fold when it fails to meet the challenge you put before it. Choose a challenge and take that risk. You may have a winning plan without taking that risk, then don&#39;t take the risk. However, most of us find us in situations where we have to challenge the Cald deck to in the hopes that we can find that opening which will create a win for us.<br />
<br />
I cannot guarantee success. However, I can tell you that your odds of surviving Cald burn is often by taking a calculated risk. If your opponent fails the challenge you present, it will then be up to you to implement a plan to capitalize on the opportunity you have been given. These same challenges can be presented to non-Cald burn decks. And while I fear that this article may not make sense, I can only hope that as others read this that they may learn to take the risks that can teach them how best to challenge their Cald opponents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bonus Notes:<br />
<br />
The following are some examples of some specific mechanics that can be used against burn mechanics. If you choose to apply any one of these, read the above article at least one more time before playing against a burn deck. They are intended to give some specific strategies and tactics that did not belong in the article above.<br />
<br />
Arderial<br />
<br />
Tranquility. This spell offers a single turn of nearly complete protection on average. It actually applies from the time you play it until the beginning of your next turn, so it can offer protection from such effects as Magam, Flamesmith. Only Rayje&#39;s Sword and cards with similar wording already built into them can cut through this. You essentially draw a replacement card, so it rarely hurts other than the two energy it costs. When playing Arderial, I love this spell. A single unpredictable turn of defense from burn can be the single turn I need to turn the game into something that favors me from thereon.<br />
<br />
Arderian-Guard Wings. Personally, I am not too fond of this one. The reduction can be devastating turn after turn. As a Cald player, I hate this relic. However as an Arderial player, I don&#39;t like it either because any bit of relic destruction can remove the protection. So, it is open to some extra weaknesses not shared by Tranquility. Another weakness it has that Tranquility does not is Lockdown by Rayje&#39;s Belt. Of course, this is personal preference.<br />
<br />
Either Arderial mechanic you choose, have a plan! <br />
<br />
Tranquility only lasts a short duration, so don&#39;t waste whatever you gain because you will be open to being burned after the protection ends.<br />
<br />
Arderian-Guard Wings is only good while the protection lasts. Your opponent may get rid of it right away, or they may not get rid of it for the rest of the game. Don&#39;t waste this time. Execute your plan while you still have the protection.<br />
<br />
Bograth.<br />
<br />
Stack them defenses up. Olabra. Treepsh. And, although I don&#39;t use it, Moob Ring can add in some extra defense. This is the first part of my two stage challenge to burn. Bograth already swarms, so I will have to offer the swarm challenge almost no matter what else I do. So, I mix the defenses around so Rayje&#39;s Belt has more targets to choose from.<br />
<br />
Second, pick a few bigger creatures to play. It is hard to present the large creature challenge without them. Bograth has a few creature with six or more energy that are good to play in a variety of swarm decks. I usually have at least a full compliment of three copies of two different Bograth creatures with a starting energy of six or more. It may not be much, but it can be the surprise that makes the difference.<br />
<br />
Cald.<br />
<br />
Um.... Who burns better? Sorry. I am not sure I can be much help for this matchup. Giant Arboll can provide a small energy advantage as long as your opponent is using creatures too. Other than that, it may simply burn down to the better Calder, or even just the luck of the flame.<br />
<br />
Core<br />
<br />
I am not all that good at Core. Generally, I run Core Grag for creatures and Maelstrom or Raveled Drush to hit magi. Otherwise, I try and present the two challenges. The addition of Dagok is fun protection from burn. I wouldn&#39;t put all my hopes in this creature though.<br />
<br />
d&#39;Resh<br />
<br />
There is Oasis, if I got my spells correct. Similar to Tranquility from Arderial. The advantage is that it doesn&#39;t stop your own energy discard as well. You simply give up drawing a card. Personally, I don&#39;t use this right now. See my note on Cald for a clue as to why. The two challenges can be more important here and Warrior&#39;s Boots is your friend. Also, d&#39;Resh has some tricks to reduce the costs of their cards which can be applied to creatures. This can make presenting challenges to a burn deck easier to pull off. See next section on Kybar&#39;s Teeth for a warning that can be applied to the Sandsifter as well.<br />
<br />
Kybar&#39;s Teeth<br />
<br />
As strange as it sounds, try and apply the two challenges. Presenting the challenge of several creatures is harder here. So, you&#39;ll probably be doing more of the challenge of the big ones. If you can pull of the challenge of a small number of creatures, so much the better.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Emec&#39;s Forge does not save a burnt crisp from discard. I have had opponents try this relic. Their creature did not have energy left when it was being discarded. It had been fried first, then it found it couldn&#39;t survive. My spell or power did not discard the creature while it had energy. It was a tough lesson for my opponents to learn. I would rather you don&#39;t have to follow their examples.<br />
<br />
Nar<br />
<br />
Freeze. Having spells or powers cost one more may not stop a burn deck, but it can put the energy games back in a ballpark you can play in. Combine with the two basic challenges to make that opening you need.<br />
<br />
Naroom<br />
<br />
Speed. While Warrior&#39;s Boots is good in almost any region, this is where I find they can truly excel. Both the Wasperine and Wasperine Stalker can compliment the boots here. Speed in card draw and speed in attacks is my preferred method for anti-Cald tactics here. The alternative is to try and gain energy faster than it can be burned. While energy gain can be powerful, it really goes nuts against Cald if you can hit out of the blue. When not striking when least expected, use the two basic challenges.<br />
<br />
Orothe<br />
<br />
Mostly, continue business as usual. The biggest mistake an Orothe opponent made against me once was to withhold playing creatures waiting for a good opening while I played Cald against them. They were right in believing that I could burn better than they could steal and interrupt things (this was during Awakening so things have changed a bit), but as a Calder I didn&#39;t need for there to be creatures in play either. When my cards where right, I went for their magi without leaving stuff for them to steal. Greater Vaal was, and is, one of my favorite Cald creatures. While I might&#39;ve burned much and still won the game if they had played more normally, I know that they let me build up a perfect setup with their extreme fear (yes, I was once a fair Calder.... but I have sort of strayed from Cald since then and probably don&#39;t represent the region as well as I once could). So, my advice for Orothe is to just play. Although, Orlon with Barls and Wellisks can be a bit fun now and then when integrated into a good Orothe deck.<br />
<br />
If you want something specifically anti-Cald, then try mixing in Storm of Fishes or Entangle. Abraxin&#39;s Crown can be a danger though, so I might look to Arderial-Orothe and use Hand of the Sky or another card to look at your opponent&#39;s hand first.<br />
<br />
Paradwyn<br />
<br />
Massive energy gain or Warrior&#39;s Boots, for stalk. Mostly, apply the two basic challenges. It may save you, but it could make a difference in a pinch. If Cald fails to get you in the first pass, Paradwyn features some energy mechanics to recover quickly.<br />
<br />
Underneath<br />
<br />
Burrow is the common answer. I would disagree. Oh, it is very helpful. Very. It must almost always be combined with several copies of Digging Goggles. Here&#39;s a brief explanation on why. When I&#39;ve played Cald versus burrow, I tend to ignore burrow. I often said to friends that a burrowed creature was on borrowed time. It could be beaten down over several turns. The burrowed creatures were only a threat when they attacked. I would get rid of Digging Goggles and then chip away at the burrowed creatures. I took a turn of hurt when they attacked for that one turn, but in the end burrow would often beat itself for me. All I had to do as the Calder was keep burning it. The advantage burrow does offer is that your creatures are tougher against Flame Geyser, Dessicate, and Inferno Xyx. This allows more of your creatures to survive when other regions would fold under the pressure. Like the article states in the end, it is not enough simply to have your creatures survive. You must have a plan and take action. Cald can counter burrow, so don&#39;t waste your efforts when your creatures do survive. Here&#39;s some examples of Cald burrow counters that Underneath cannot easily answer: Lava Flow (burn with built in sword) and Spark Chogo (burn with built in sword). A wise Calder will burn first with something that doesn&#39;t have a built in sword and then do the extra blow with one of these two options which will hurt your creature(s). Cald usually has to be prepared for some of these defenses anyways. So, if they&#39;re ready for you, what is your plan for when the shield does work?<br />
<br />
Universal<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t play universal as a separate region, so I personally cannot offer any advice here.<br />
<br />
Weave<br />
<br />
Massive energy gain. Weave Seed and The Hunt to maximize the effect of creatures that survive. Speag, Pody, Lascinth, Grass Hyren, and Sawgrass are just a few of the cards that can become relatively useless when getting burnt. This kills a lot of defensive Weave without triggering any of its strengths. Do not defend unless you must. Attack. Use the two challenges proposed in the article, or Warrior&#39;s Boots, to get a creature that you can attack with. Uwamar becomes far more useful now. Sure, it can&#39;t attack but it gains enough energy if it survives to start requiring a Calder to devote resources that was meant for a large creature to eliminate something you only had to invest three energy into. My experience on this comes from games that stand out in my memory from both sides of the fence. At least a few times as the Weave player surviving Cald, and several times as the Calder burning down Weave. Weave is weak against Cald. If Cald is really a problem for you, might I suggest a Junjertrug deck. The Junjertrug Horn and the Stumbling Junjertrug is good, and really good versus Cald. When they added the Stumbling Junjertrug, I knew that Weave needed this creature. Still, I don&#39;t recommend you really solely upon just these two cards. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=6352&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
