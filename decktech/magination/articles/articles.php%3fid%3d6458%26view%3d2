There may be an exception or two to this, but that will be determined more often by the Calder than your deck. You must anticipate that a Cald deck will burn your creatures and/or your magi. This is practically inescapable. Many will turn to protection cards to counter Cald burn. For many of the protection cards, there is either a Cald response or the protection is limited and lasts for but a short time.<br />
<br />
So how come I have won against Cald if they are going to burn my stuff game after game after game? It could be summed up in two simple principles. First, belief that Cald can be beaten. Second, challenge Cald and don&#39;t give up. Sometimes I have nearly lost sight of a win against an opposing Cald deck only to find that by persisting just a bit longer that I find a waterfall of success just beyond the oppressing heat. Sometimes it seems like there was hardly any heat there at all. And other times, I get burnt all the way into defeat. <br />
<br />
If Cald can beat me, why don&#39;t I fear it? I first learned to win my own games of Magi-Nation with Cald long before I started playing online like I do currently. On gatlingEngine, I may be known as a Naroom player, but there was a time the Magi-Nation players at the local card shop feared my Cald. You could say that as a former and sometimes practicing Calder that I am aware of some of the challenges the Cald player may face as they play a game of Magi-Nation.<br />
<br />
So before I go into more details on my two basic principles for when facing Cald, let me begin to set the stage and try to explain some of the basic ways Cald burns the opposition it faces. Why do I think I should spend some time on this? The insight I hope to share just might help you understand what your Cald opponent is doing and improve your chances of finding and exploiting a potential weakness. To quote a recent book I read, Before we can master an enemy, we must know its name, its habits, and its place of abode. (Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich)<br />
<br />
From my early experience with Cald, the knowledge I gained then would later give me strength in my games against Cald. So those of you that fear Cald, swallow your fears for this next part and learn a little of how this part-time Calder burns his opponents. This knowledge might help tip the scales when everything else is even. If you can tip it in your favor, so much the better.<br />
<br />
As a Calder, I might divide Cald spells and powers into three basic categories. Does the card, or combination of cards, burn one creature for a massive amount of energy? Does the card burn many creatures in one shot? Or, am I using multiple spells and powers to discard small chunks of energy repeatedly to do the job? There are some supporting cards too, but the burn of Cald can usually be divided according to these three questions.<br />
<br />
When burning one creature for a massive amount we look at Greater Vaal, Inferno Xyx, and Gorgle&#39;s Gift. A lot of these cards have basic costs that tend to weigh in around Shockwave. It is just another avenue to do roughly the same thing. However, just like Shockwave, most of these spells and powers tend to burn just one creature at a time.<br />
<br />
If multiple creatures tends to be the problem, Cald has options to deal with that too. Wildfire and Core Grag were a couple of my favorites. Flame Geyser is rather popular too. These spells and powers aren&#39;t as effective against a few large creatures, but some judicious application of them might bring some of the big creatures down into range to burned into oblivion with another option on hand. It is good to have some support like this in a Cald deck, but it is easier for one or two large creatures to escape being totally fried.<br />
<br />
A good number of Cald spells and powers don&#39;t hit very hard and rely on multiple applications to get the job done. Brushfire and Ergar are excellent examples of this. It isn&#39;t until repeated heavily that the burn takes its toll. To handle swarms, you burn one creature after another until they are all gone. When dealing with large creatures, you burn the same creature repeatedly until it is gone. This method tends to be heavily reliant on a replenishing cards in your hand.<br />
<br />
If Cald is so well conceived and balanced in its burn, how can you possibly win? Remember that it is possible to defeat Cald. Once you believe you have lost against Cald, you may have just lost before playing the first card. Believe you will win and you may find your opportunity to do so.<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t expect the fear of getting burnt to go away. Courage isn&#39;t always a lack of fear, rather the ability to go on despite the fear. If you let your fear control you, you may be giving your opponent the victory. Quite often I have seen people say that they cannot win and proceed to demonstrate this. Such fears can cripple any of us.<br />
<br />
How can you overcome your fear? To conquer your fear, you must face it. Tell yourself that you can win. Tell yourself that you can win until you begin to believe it. When you lose, continue to tell yourself that you can win. Begin to believe that you can win against Cald and you will begin your journey to victory. Until you believe you can win, you may see a decisive victory against Cald as just a fluke that will never repeat. Believe you can win, and that victory may become that tip of the avalanche of victories waiting to be unleashed.<br />
<br />
So if the belief that you can win is so key, why did I mention challenging Cald at the beginning and then explained how Cald worked? I included the basic burn mechanics to help you understand what you are going to challenge.<br />
<br />
Cald really is working with the same basic resources you are. Their magi energizes to create the basic energy they use. This energy is spent on creatures, spells, and relics. The cards in their hand represent the creatures, spells, and relics they have available to use. The basic mechanics they work within are the same mechanics that you must deal with too. It is how they use these mechanics that can make Cald so good at burning the opposition.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the basic ways Cald can burn? That is how I challenge the Calders I face off against. In essence, I play to their strengths to see if they have the resources on hand to deal with the challenge I give them. Can they burn big stuff? Can they burn a lot of creatures? Can they do a mix of both?<br />
<br />
Can they burn big stuff?<br />
<br />
So what constitutes a big enough creature to challenge Cald with as something big? It is hard to say. As general rule of thumb, I try and have creatures with five or more energy in play when I present this challenge. Six or more energy preferred. The creature may not have to be that big to present this challenge. If it is cost effective to use Shockwave on your creature, it is probably better to use a Cald spell or power designed for larger creatures.<br />
<br />
It is really simple. If all their spells and powers on hand are for small stuff, then one or two big creatures will take a lot of their resources for them to burn. As they use up these resources to deal with large creatures, it may become difficult for them to burn larger creatures.<br />
<br />
What if they can burn they big stuff? Then deal with it. You may want to try again. You are either using up what resources they have to deal with big creatures, or you may be discovering that it is the entire strength of their deck. If their deck specializes in burning large creatures, try the next challenge.<br />
<br />
Can they burn a lot of creatures?<br />
<br />
This is a common challenge I will post to many creatureless decks as well. Shockwave, Gorgle&#39;s Curse, and others are all good options to deal with one creature. But what about four or five creatures in play? This is where cards like Core Grag, Wildfire, and Flame Geyser become far superior options. If I spent three energy for four different creatures and my opponent is spending an average of five energy and one card each to deal with my creatures, than odds favor me if I can keep it up long enough. Or, even if they aren&#39;t spending five energy each but just cannot get them all, that still means I am up by however many creatures managed to survive. This can be very encouraging.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, pay attention to how they hit multiple creatures. If they used one card, do you feel up to seeing if they can do it again? It could be that several of their cards hit large creatures instead and are dead weight in their hand while they face a swarm of small creatures. If you can force them to use up what resources they have to hit small creatures with, your creatures may start surviving once they run out of cards to deal with multiple creatures.<br />
<br />
I do want to point out at least two problems you&#39;ll face when using this strategy. The first problem you face is keeping plenty of creatures in your hand to play with. If you can a steady supply of creatures in your hand and energy on your Magi to play them with, then you can present this challenge as often as you desire.<br />
<br />
The second problem with this strategy that has to do with the Calder and not yourself. You must be wary of Gorgle&#39;s Glasses. Cald does not have much natural card draw and it usually isn&#39;t difficult to force Cald to run out of the appropriate cards. However, a single Gorgle&#39;s Glasses in play may mean that Calder suddenly starts ripping through their deck and netting the right cards as they blast multiple creatures with a single spell or power. When you use this challenge, remember this danger. Gorgle&#39;s Glasses are usually not your friend. When using this challenge to try and defeat your Cald opponent, Gorgle&#39;s Glasses are your enemy.<br />
<br />
Can they do a mix of both?<br />
<br />
When I can do it, this is how prefer to challenge my Cald opponents. I want a creature or two that it would be ideal for the Calder to use a spell or power that hits tall. In addition to the challenge for big creatures, preferably two of them, I want several creatures in play so that spells and powers that hit multiple creatures would be the best choice. This sort of challenge works best on a Cald Magi currently operating on somewhat limited resources. A Magi short on energy might find it difficult to come up with the energy to do both options even if the have the cards in hand. Or, if they have spent too many cards in their hand, then this challenge usually finds them unable to do both despite plenty of energy.<br />
<br />
Posting both challenges usually requires a fresh Magi on your part. It also requires a balanced deck. This is why most of this article does not address the methods of protection. Stacking your deck up on protection against Cald may be jeopardizing the strengths of your own deck. If your deck cannot accomplish its own goal(s), then it may lose to Cald decks because it failed to do anything and not because the protection was inappropriate.<br />
<br />
This isn&#39;t to say that protecting your deck against Cald doesn&#39;t work. Just be wise in your choices. If choose to seek protection against Cald&#39;s burn, I suggest that you do not compromise whatever your own deck was built to do. Some of the potential protection cards actually help some decks work even when they are not facing Cald. Just try to choose the right cards in the right quantity. Experiment as needed.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, remember that when facing Cald you are most likely going to have spells and powers discard energy from your creatures. It nearly unavoidable. While I cannot guarantee you success against Cald, it is possible to win. Once you believe you can win, then understanding how Cald tends to use spells and powers to do its burn can be helpful. While protection from Cald is often helpful, you can often find an opportunity to defeat Cald by trying to get some of your creatures to survive the burn as you present challenges to your opponent. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=6458&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
