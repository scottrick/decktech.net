This can vary greatly depending on how you look at things. If I am looking for balance between deck types and the regions, a new set can fix things that may be currently unbalanced. Or, it could create a new imbalance. However, if I am looking at things in relations to player versus player, then no. A good player remains a good player and that only changes if they change and has no direct relation to the cards they have before them.<br />
<br />
All too often Ive heard people say that they arent going to play Magi-Nation until the next set comes out because that will make things different and somehow equal. This usually isnt because they are lacking in certain cards, but because they face repeated defeat from the same people time after time. Being one of those people whos known among the locals for winning frequently, I find this frustrating and humorous at the same time. Frustrating because it makes it harder for me to find a friendly game. And, humorous because it doesnt work that way. Perhaps it would be true if the people winning didnt buy into the new set, yet not even that is not enough at times.<br />
<br />
I will use a few other games to help illustrate this.<br />
<br />
The first collectible card game I started playing was the Dragon Ball Z CCG. At first, I wasnt all too good, but I did learn fast. As I started collecting cards, my collection enabled me to build the decks that suited me. Eventually, I became one of the locals to beat.<br />
<br />
However, I grew tired of the DBZ CCG. New sets were changing the mechanics of the game in ways I wasnt too fond of. Plus, a lot of players were getting stuck on main personality power levels and new power cards. I could no longer trade any of my extra stuff that I had from the first couple sets as no one wanted them. Adding in to that mix, the newer starter decks would each come with certain uncommon cards in such quantities that by the time I was done collecting anything I would have more of those cards than I did many of the common ones. Basically, the game was losing my interest fast, while Magi-Nation was taking over the spot as my game of choice.<br />
<br />
While I ditched my extras since I couldnt actually trade them, I kept a playable collection. Several sets later, I could still beat many of the locals with decks built with those older cards. It took about two sets worth of expansions before my old decks were severely challenged just from the changes in the sets. And then, just buying a few packs and trading for that one rare here and there brought them back up to where they once were. Now, about four sets or more after I was actively playing and collecting the game, I finally find myself in a situation where my older decks are failing to compete altogether. Would the scales have turned against me if I was still collecting the game like when I first started? Probably not. Just as the game has changed, I wouldve adapted and had the resources in cards to match.<br />
<br />
So what does a new set alter? I find it doesnt alter the players, other than perhaps adding or subtracting players from the general pool.<br />
<br />
A new set alters the balance of the cards, the decks, and the strategies behind them. This applies to a vast number of games. Although, I find this change of balance most interesting in Magi-Nation. Among the games I do play, the changes to the balance of cards, decks, and strategies brought about by a new is probably most apparent in Magic the Gathering.<br />
<br />
While this was a part of my problem with the DBZ CCG, they had also changed the basic rules to the game as well over those four sets or so I hadnt been actively playing in. While Magic the Gathering (Magic) may have seen some changes to their rules, over the past couple years that Ive been playing collectible cards games, Magic has been fairly stable as far as the rules goes. What makes changes readily apparent in Magic is their several tournament/deck types. Since expansions are divided into a few types, block (just the expansions in that block) and type two (the two most current blocks, plus the most recent core/base set) decks see the most change.<br />
<br />
The recent expansion, Mirrodin, introduced a new mechanic called affinity. Whole new decks arose centered around this, and it became a real powerful deck type. In Magi-Nation, we would probably call it broken. However, in Magic, these apparently broken decks are allowed to exist and then fade away as a new set comes out to balance the problem, or sweep them under the rug as the next block of expansions forces it out of block or type two.<br />
<br />
In the expansion prior to this, they introduced something called storm. This made a deck based around a card called Brain Freeze very powerful. Astral Slide made another group of decks powerful, and goblin decks got a powerful boost recently. Basically, there is a few basic types of decks that are dominant during each expansion, and this alters as each new expansion comes out.<br />
<br />
So, where does this leave players like myself who doesnt have the cards to build one of these elite decks? Or, who doesnt collect or trade the game as extensively to build one of those decks? Out in the cold most likely. That doesnt mean that I cant stall or occasionally beat one of those decks. I managed to stall a good goblin deck out to six or eight turns, against a fairly good player too. Against a not quite so good player and not quite so good goblin deck, I did manage to win. Although, affinity is another story. A not so good player in a one-on-one game trounced me with affinity and there was hardly anything I could do about it. And, against a deck designed to trounce affinity, well, I didnt do so hot either. Then again, the player behind that deck was also one of the best in Utah as well. So, it was more the player than just the deck that beat me then.<br />
<br />
Eventually, affinity decks will fade away. Goblin decks will become more balanced. But, that doesnt mean a player like myself will have any better of a chance to win. There will be new decks, and the top players in Utah will probably still be the top players in Utah. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy my decks that play around and try to win. And, yes, I still do get a little respect in Magic. But, I doubt very many ever see me as a contender for the top ten, or even top fifty, in Utah. I dont take it very seriously, and I dont see a reason to either.<br />
<br />
Now, I come to Magi-Nation, a game I like very much. Have the prior expansions changed the game much?<br />
<br />
Well, we did find a few broken cards that needed fixing. This seemed to lead to vast number of fixes. Some just clarifications, and some actually making cards better. Also, some of the errata hasnt changed things much at all. There is one fix that I totally agree with, and that was a fix to prevent an infinite energy combo. Massive energy is one thing, though infinite makes for a guaranteed, broken deck. It had to be fixed, and fixed it was.<br />
<br />
Generally, we did get some new regions. There are a few more mechanics. Burrow works better. Kybars Teeth got some much needed help. A couple new ways to win were introduced, Oracles and Awakening. There are some newer deck types, including a creatureless Core, or nearly creatureless. More protection and more cards to counter that protection. There are more flip-kill options. Yet, a lot of the balance has been maintained. Overall, Ive been quite pleased with the expansions to Magi-Nation. Well, other than the long delays lately.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the next expansion will flesh out Nar and dResh, the two newest regions. From the available spoilers, it looks like a new eebit theme should be possible. Plus, there are hints at more to do with discard piles. There is both a card to oppose such a theme and a couple to complement such revealed. There looks to be a new scarletsong theme, and perhaps a crystal theme for Underneath. Yet, all we have so far are a few teasers, so its hard to say what exactly this new set will entail. What will make it most interesting is that this will be the first set that doesnt introduce a new region. So, in many ways, this next set we are waiting for can, or will, setup how future expansions affect the game.<br />
<br />
While I do wonder what all will unfold with a new expansion to Magi-Nation, there is one thing I dont expect to change too much. Unless this new expansion somehow completely destroys how the game currently works and its balance, those players who expect a new set to balance them against the top players will be disappointed. They must improve first before a new set can really help them. And, this is why I find it humorous that they refuse to play games until then. For, in my mind, the situation will be repeated after this next set. Theyll play again, find that they still lose, and stop playing until the next set comes out. I didnt become as good as I am at Magi-Nation by quitting and waiting for the next set.<br />
<br />
As we wait for Traitors Reach to be released, remember that a new set might change what works and what doesnt but it wont change you as a player. Only with practice, effort, or some form of learning can that happen. Yes, some of us have a vast selection of cards to choose from as we build our decks. While the cards themselves can have quite an impact on a game, it is the player who determines what happens in the end. The player is more important. This is why I expect Bond Williams to become a great player at Magi-Nation. He is the player who learned to beat me at the DBZ CCG. He learned to look past the power cards and find the strategies that myself and other older players used. Once he did this, he learned to correctly identify the new power cards and use them correctly. Because hes now playing Magi-Nation, I have even more incentive to stay current with future sets. I know he will learn strategies and not just the tricks.<br />
<br />
So if you are waiting for the next set to play because itll give you that one or two cards you need to beat another player, I dont recommend it. As for those that truly believe that their wait will pay off, I am saddened. In the meantime, those of us playing are either trying at catch up to those better than ourselves, or we are broadening the gap with those that are not. Or, we just might be having some fun while we wait. Personally, I hope to improve myself a little and have a large dose of fun to pass the time. Just because there hasnt been a set for a year doesnt mean that theres no fun left in this game. I think there is evidence to the contrary. Even the little activity this site still receives is evidence that some of us are still here to have fun, to help new players, or to catch up to older players.<br />
<br />
Tonight, I would probably be going to the local store to help out some new players if I could, but I sort of have a date this afternoon. I am not sure if Ill have much time afterwards. Because, as fun as I find this game, I dont want to be a single adult forever. Who knows, we might even play a game of Magi-Nation on the date. Just kidding. However, we have played an introductory game of Magi-Nation on another occasion, so it looks like I might have some pleasant company some time in the future when I go to a tournament or some such.... if I am so fortunate. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=5344&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
