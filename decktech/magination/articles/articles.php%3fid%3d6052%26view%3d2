I could create a basic deck list and post a bit of a strategy on how I suggest to play it. However, in this case, the deck list is already available on Noveltys Custom Card forums. I could just write the strategy to the deck then, but that doesnt seem right either. No, I am wishing that I had written down the very first build of that deck. What I would like to do is illustrate in some small degree how the deck evolved in just some small measure from a deck that failed to a deck that went four games undefeated.<br />
<br />
When I first saw Warrada, Simulacrum, I wanted to make a deck with that magi. I did not care if the deck worked or not. While I respect the power of the corrupted Warrada, I have often wondered just who she might have been before she turned to Core. I imagined that she was actually a fairly powerful Naroom magi at one time.<br />
<br />
My first build of the deck started with Tiller just like the tournament deck. Warrada, Simulacrum, came second and I used Tdek as the third magi. The Eebit Twins were tossed into the deck because they just looked so cute. Evus Bookworm was a relic, so it would work with Tillers power. This gave a full choice of three of the four Elders Legacy Naroom cards in the deck. The Simulacrum starts with a Forest Wudge, so three of these and then a full selection of other Naroom creatures to build a basic Naroom deck.<br />
<br />
The deck was then tested against Novelty and a dResh deck. I dont think I will forget that game for a little while. There was two reasons that made that game stand out in my mind. The first was my miserable loss. In many ways, I knew why the deck I built had failed so terribly. Tiller is a great setup magi. Tiller and Salafy are a great combo for setting up another magi. I had sold Warrada, Simulacrum, short. In addition, I knew that Naroom could be far more aggressive than what I had played and put on a far stronger defense and offense. I felt bad for what I had done with the deck. Novelty noted that I really didnt play with Tdek. The deck had folded almost completely by this point. There wasnt anything in my hand that could do much of anything to buy even a little time to get to any of the real options that I shouldve put in the deck.<br />
<br />
In addition to watching the Naroom deck fold under the pressure, that game stood out to me because Novelty employed a deck type I had never before seen. I cant say that I engraved that game in my memory, because my memory isnt that good. I do recall clearly some of the very basics. It was one of the first times that I really learned that Channelers Gloves can be a very good relic in the right conditions. It was complimented with card draw off the magi and the three Rayjes Constructs that made up three of the four creatures in the deck. Bottled City made for a powerful way to get those four creatures out of the deck and into play. Another relic could render the constructs into illusionary creatures. Impact could be used to hit the magi then, and Aubras Canteen was used to draw five cards once the other cards were discarded to other powers and so forth. It was a fast deck. I had never seen dResh used like that. And, I never did see the second or third magi.<br />
<br />
You can learn from a good defeat, and that was certainly a good defeat. Because of many defeats in the past, both my own and my opponents, I had learned a few lessons on playing Naroom. While making some changes to the deck would not guarantee that it would be able to face and survive powerful tactics like that which had been used in that game, I did know that the deck could be much better. Warrada, Simulacrum, had not been given a fair chance to battle. Not because of my opponent, but because I knew better than what I had tossed together just because it was cute or I wanted to.<br />
<br />
I began looking for more speed. How can you get faster than Tiller? I put in Warriors Boots. Useful to sacrifice to Tillers power if so chosen. Yet, that powerful relic would easily give the deck more speed going into attacks as needed. To deal with cheap, or illusionary creatures, Furok would be key. Combined with a full Alpine Xamf, Robes of Vines, and Orwins Ring add energy scenario, the deck should be able to plow through illusions with a little more ease. I had run a Tiller-Yaki-Pruitt deck against illusions before and plowed through them between Furok and the energy combo. Salafy moved into the second magi slot, pushing Simulacrum to the final slot. Salafy could setup Sperri nicely with three Furok and three Baby Furok. This time, Salafy would run with only the three Furok, but her purpose would be to setup the three Forest Wudge and at least two Forest Jile for Warrada. I had seen the power of Salafy before, so I knew this could work.<br />
<br />
In the end, I kept Eebit Twins and Eebit in the deck just because I wanted to. Having moved the deck into something far more aggressive, wasperines wouldve made a better choice. Eebit could still fit in because it would bounce to the hand whether attacking or defending in an attack. Eebit Twins was focused on defense, and the deck probably wouldnt really use that defensive effect anymore. Still, I wanted to preserve some of the original fun behind the creation of the deck.<br />
<br />
While the deck is available for viewing elsewhere, here is the second, or rebuilt, version of the deck:<br />
<br />
Magi: <br />
<br />
Tiller (starting: Weebo, Weeblit, Vortex of Knowledge) <br />
Salafy (starting: Fird, Furok, Tap Roots) <br />
Warrada, Simulacrum (starting: Forest Wudge) <br />
<br />
Deck: <br />
<br />
3x Alpine Xamf <br />
3x Eebit <br />
3x Eebit Twins <br />
1x Fird <br />
3x Forest Jile <br />
3x Forest Wudge <br />
3x Furok <br />
3x Giant Carillion <br />
1x Weebo <br />
<br />
2x Evu&#39;s Bookworm <br />
2x Orwin&#39;s Ring 2x Relic Stalker <br />
2x Robe of Vines <br />
2x Warrior&#39;s Boots <br />
1x Weeblit <br />
<br />
2x Bythan&#39;s Gift <br />
2x Crushing Roots <br />
1x Tap Roots <br />
1x Vortex of Knowledge <br />
<br />
Total: 40 Cards (not counting magi)<br />
<br />
As my opponents may have learned, I almost always use the Vortex of Knowledge on my first turn. This even allowed Tiller to hold on fairly well against Sorreah when Tiller had gone second and could not use his powers. It turned out to be a fairly solid deck. Of the five games I have played it so far, Warrada, Simulacrum has not seen play yet. While that might seem a little impressive, what really thrilled me was that I have had far better hands going into situations where Warrada might see action. That alone would make this a better deck than the first build.<br />
<br />
I had built another variant of the deck as well because I had heard that this Warrada had been created with the Forest Hyren in mind. I had a Forest Hyren deck once. What had allowed it to do well was magi and creatures with powers and effects that directly complimented the Forest Hyren. Simply reducing its cost by one energy and not even starting with the creature didnt real feel like a Forest Hyren magi to me. As it was, I did play at least one test of the Forest Hyren variant. It failed. There may be another way of going about it that couldve worked.<br />
<br />
As for my building a deck with Warrada, Simulacrum, I like how my Forest Wudge variant turned out. It will probably be the core in the design of any other Simulacrum deck I may choose to build in the future.<br />
<br />
It is my hope that in reading this article you may have gleaned a little on some few points. Mostly, I hope you have learned that losing a game, or a number of them, can be a great learning experience. While my example here really only references the one loss, I hope you realize that there was many other defeats in the past with other decks that led to my rather quick analysis of what I had done wrong in the deck design. I have heard it said by a millionaire that the real losers are the people who quit. To fail and learn is the way they became a millionaire. To fail and learn is how I learned this game. I might have rapidly improved in the beginning, but I hope I can still learn from my mistakes. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=6052&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
