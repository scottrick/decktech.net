He had high hopes for this deck. After hours of searching the many pieces of information on dechtech.net, he felt he was ready to takeon the world. He looked at his boss, the owner of the very CCG shop he now worked in, and smirked nervously as the other players around him did their thing. His boss had helped him make this deck one way or another, and Kyle knew that this evening would be interesting indeed.<br>
<br>
Finally the tournament began. 6:30 had come, and the names of the participants were taken as the store owner and player sat at the table. Kyle watched as 5 other players eagerly signed up, brining the running total of combatants to 7. One person each round would have the luck of recieving an automatic win, since the number was uneven. It didn&#39;t matter though, Kyle needed to test this deck as best he could.<br>
<br>
The owner left the building for a moment, leaving Kyle with the other players who quickly made last minute adjustments. He was eager to play, to test the might of this deck he had so much confidence in. Soon, the owner returned, and posted the pairings on the wall.<br>
<br>
Kyle was set to fight a younger new player, whose experiance wasn&#39;t that great. This was a good thing, since he shouldn&#39;t get beaten too badly should the deck prove ineffective. Still, when the player flipped over his first Magi, revealing Kazm, Kyle sighed. A Kybar&#39;s Teeth deck. This may take awhile.<br>
<br>
And of course, the match surpassed the stated 40 minutes designated for the round, leaving Kyle with 2 Magi left, and the younger player with 1. Kyle had won his first victory! But only just slightly. If it hadn&#39;t been for the modified rules of whoever has the most Magi&#39;s left wins, the match have been a tie. But the tournament was being played using a point system, and those two remaing Magi were factored into the win in case of a tie. Kyle knew it had something to do with his inclusion of his Harban&#39;s and overwhelming swarm of small creatures. Those Corrupts didn&#39;t hurt either...<br>
<br>
Kyle was nervous. He had done alright, but he could not finish his opponent. This may get bad, he thought, as he shuffled the deck over and over while the owner headed off to retrieve the next pairings. He returned just as Kyle finished, and posted it up over the old one. Kyle was set to fight a much more experianced player who uses the Naroom. This would be interesting.<br>
<br>
But to his shock, the round didn&#39;t last that long! Since his deck was built on the concept of getting many small creatures on the board quickly, he overwhelmed the Naroom fairly quickly. He had also Entombed their most vital energy adding spells, which hindered his opponents quest for supremecy. Before he knew it, he had finished his opponents last Magi before she could reach his third. It seemed that his deck was well balanced after all. He had always had trouble against her. But he was ready for her. His Entombs had helped a lot, and he got all three rather quickly. He managed to stay on top in terms of creature count most of the time, and threw out the odd Blight to keep things in his favor. Not bad. Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
The round ended, giving Kyle a second victory. Things were looking up, and he smiled as he sat down to shuffle again. Soon the owner returned, and posted up the next pairings. Kyle&#39;s spirit took a nose dive; he was facing his boss, who was one of the best players in town! This would be a real test.<br>
<br>
Kyle sat down and prepared himself. After winning the dice roll, and declaring himself the first to go, he quickly did his thing, finding to his horror that he had somehow managed to pull 3 relics in his starting hand. This of course wasn&#39;t good, since his starting Magi was Chur. This may be more difficult.<br>
<br>
But it seemed his boss wasn&#39;t having much luck with his draws either. For a long time Kyle did not see the usual spells he expected from his opponent, and the creatures weren&#39;t as numerous as he had anticipated. With relics being unplayable, Kyle had a small advantage, and quickly began to catch up in the creature count. Before he knew it, he had knocked his boss down to 2 Magi before he lost his first. Either he did a very good job of constructing this deck, or his opponent was still getting those crappy draws.<br>
<br>
The round ended with Kyle the winner again. He had saved up for his second Magi, who was Ogar, and quickly dispatched his opponents last one (Gar) thank to Rayje&#39;s Sword and a couple Warrior&#39;s Boots. With 3 wins, things were looking good again... until the next pairings were up.<br>
<br>
Kyle had to fight another Kybar&#39;s deck, and not only that, the player he was set to fight was in the top 5 in Canada. Right up there with his boss. This would be another toughie.<br>
<br>
The battle was long an grueling, and after losing his first Magi almost right away, Kyle had doubts. But he quickly came back and brought down his opponents first as well. After that the battle was long and tedious, as any would be when a Kybar&#39;s deck is present. But soon, Kyle had managed to bring his opponent down to his third Magi, while still on his second. This battle ended because the time ran out as well, but Kyle had one Magi more, and was awarded the win.<br>
<br>
To his shock and disbelief, Kyle had somehow managed to win his first Sanctioned Tournament, with a region he had previously written an article about being far too weak. Things have changed with Kyle, and his attitude towards the region he had been most faithful to had changed significantly. The Core isn&#39;t quite as weak as he had them figured. So maybe he was wrong...?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Overall, I managed to win because of a few reasons.<br>
<br>
1) I sat down and really thought about a lot of things. What goal should I set for the deck? What strategy could I use that would work on most regions? Which cards would help me do this? After thinking all this through, and getting some advice from my boss, I managed to build a pretty fair deck.<br>
<br>
2) I learned from my mistakes. I know when to throw out which creature, and I know when I should and should not sacrifice my Magi in favor of the one after. I know the top decks in my area descently well, so I could prepare for them.<br>
<br>
3) I used a tactic that gave my Core deck an advantage without giving my opponent too many ways to get around it. Before I made decks based around using all my good creatures, like Gorath and Darkbreed Hyren. But creatures like that were very susceptable to things like Core resistant creatures and Shockwaves. Now, with many many little creatures and spells and relics that are in there solely to help them swarm, I am more tuned to one goal and therefor more successful.<br>
<br>
4) I found ways around anti-Core stuff. Usually I would whine and squeal when I saw a Darge. Now I hit it so it can&#39;t do anything major, and then take it out using effects and the like. I&#39;ve gotten just a little bit smarter.<br>
<br>
5) I managed to make a deck that allowed me to make use of every card at any time. Usually when I drew my two cards, I could feel safe in knowing that they could be very useful when my next turn comes around. Nothing is in there that isn&#39;t very flexible (except Relic Stalkers. They&#39;re a one-trick-pony).<br>
<br>
Well, I think I&#39;ve typed enough. Hope you enjoyed the read.<br>
