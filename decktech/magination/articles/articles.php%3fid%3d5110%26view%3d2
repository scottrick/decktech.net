In there, it was mentioned that one way to defeat an opposing swarm of creatures was to build a swarm of your own. Now, a bit later, here&#8217;s an article presenting some suggestions for swarm deck construction, a few methods for building the swarm, and a couple possibilities on how to apply or use said swarm.<br />
<br />
So, how did I learn to build swarms? It could have been from simply observing other players. Although, I think it more or less evolved as I grew in my love for this game and in my ability to build and play decks for the various regions.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#8217;t until I felt one of our locals deserved to sit on the other end of a totally overwhelming number of creatures that I put in a real effort to build any deck that truly swarmed out of control. We had a player that would build overwhelming swarms, and he often toyed with his opponents while they were helpless to do anything about it. While I rarely lost to him, I eventually tired of seeing this done to fellow players and thought it was about time he sat on the other side of the fence. With that goal in mind, my first true swarm deck was built. Since then, I have actually built several swarm decks using several different regions. <br />
<br />
Some of the ideas I am going to present here can be applied to almost any region, even Bograth, a region that is built towards this end. Depending on the region, these varied tricks will differ in their usefulness and availability. Many swarm decks differ from a more normal deck only in that they are designed with the goal to place many creatures into play rather than just a few. And, from experience, I know that even Kybar&#8217;s Teeth can create a creature swarm.<br />
<br />
When building a deck to swarm, the first thing I will recommend is a deck with no more than forty cards, total. A couple cards over is okay, but a swarm deck with forty cards has higher odds of working than its match with sixty to eighty cards. Even though this restricts the total width of deck, or how many creatures it is possible to have in play, it does greatly improve the swarm deck. Usually, once you are about ten to twelve creatures wide, you are already out of control and will be tough to stop. It doesn&#8217;t even need to be that wide to be a swarm, eight creatures wide can be a overpowering. The forty card deck can do this faster, and it will be more consistent than the oversized deck.<br />
<br />
Out of that forty card deck, you&#8217;ll want twenty-one to twenty-seven of those cards to be creatures. It is possible to run the deck entirely with creatures, although you probably want to add some supporting cards like you would in a normal deck. For example, my Bograth decks have been quite successful using about twenty-five to twenty-seven creatures, the rest is spells and relics. This easily provides enough creatures to swarm with, as you should average at least one creature each turn. If you feel a great need to use a deck with more than forty cards, I suggest about seventy-five percent of the deck be creatures. In other words, three of every four cards. You take greater risks on your card draw when using a large deck, and a swarm deck needs creatures. Smaller decks can get away with a slightly smaller percentage of creatures and still swarm easily.<br />
<br />
As you build your swarm deck, it can be important to consider the size of creatures you plan to use. If you are using larger creatures, than card draw won&#8217;t be much of a concern since your magi will only be able to average one creature per turn after they first flip, not adjusting for other tricks you may include in the deck. Card draw becomes more important in those decks where the magi can play more cards each turn than the two you draw normally. For example, in a Kybar&#8217;s Teeth deck, two copies of Gogor&#8217;s Spade may be all the additional card draw it needs because the creatures are larger and some other trick will usually be needed before the deck can actually swarm, while a Bograth deck may be have several creatures, plus a relic or two, to increase card draw because it so many of its creatures are small and the magi can usually play two to four creatures each turn without any other tricks.<br />
<br />
As you build your swarm deck, you need to have some plan on how you are going to create the swarm. There are several methods to creating a swarm, and this is the reason that many of the regions can swarm. It is not always good to play with just small creatures for your swarm, and this basic strategy can even hurt at times. Sometimes, you may build a swarm of creatures simply by saving energy, or reducing their costs. Or, you may choose to create some extra energy for your magi.<br />
<br />
There are a few tricks for saving energy. Most of the ones I can think of right off the top of my head actually reside in Bograth, a region already full of small creatures. Still, every little bit can end up making big contributions in the end. My favorite Bograth deck (not posted) doesn&#8217;t use any creatures smaller than two energy, and yet my second magi could flip and have six to eight creatures in play by the end of the turn, with plenty of energy to spare, by simply using Crushing Stench to place out a Swamp Hyren. That deck also used Deadwood Staff to save on energy. There are other cards that save energy, such as the Thoughtful Baldar, Sand Hyren, and Robe of Petals, to name a few. By saving energy, your magi may be able to play more than they usually could each turn. This could be at least one creature each turn, possibly more.<br />
<br />
Another way to come up with the energy to swarm with is to come up with extra energy to play creatures with. While you can focus on magi with high energize rates for this, it is sometimes possible to use one trick or another to get a little more energy to work with. For example, the Orathan Flyer has its own energize rate, cannot attack, but you can use energy from it to play other creatures. A bit different, the N&#8217;kala is great for Bograth or Paradwyn with it&#8217;s ability to add energy to your magi. This one energy can add up, especially if combined with another card to increase the total energy gained each turn. Much like saving energy, increasing the energy you have to play with can allow your magi to place more creatures into play.<br />
<br />
Many swarm decks simply play cheap creatures that they grow, in one form or another, into a threat. This method is often the most common. Many Bograth creatures are quite small, allowing the magi to play three or more creatures each turn with their basic energize rate. Unlike the other two methods mentioned here for creating swarms, this method tends to be very dependant on a continuous card draw. Since the creatures are so cheap, the player can easily run out of cards in the hand to play out. However, it is very easy to make these small swarms into much larger threats. Since Bograth has so many small creatures, it should be no surprise that it has quite a few tricks to grow its swarm. A Bograth swarm can grow fairly easily using a mix of Jile, Moss Pendant, and Olabra&#8217;s Staff, to name a few. The wider the swarm, the more energy that can be gained each turn. Some of the other regions have similar tricks, too.<br />
<br />
When I built an Arderial swarm deck, I used Orathan Flyers to come up with extra energy. It was topped off with the Storm Shield to both grow the swarm and to give the Orathan Flyer even more energy for me to work with. Additionally, Lady of the Sky increased Shimmer&#8217;s energize rate by one. This combination of energy tricks allowed Shimmer to create and maintain the swarm I sought. As such, &#8220;Shimmer&#8217;s Dangerous Smile&#8221; was my first intentional swarm deck. When I finally did get to use that swarm deck against my chosen victim, it ended up being an overwhelming force quickly under Shimmer&#8217;s control.<br />
<br />
While simply being able to build an impressive swarm can put in a damper in your opponent&#8217;s day, it is often much better if you can do something with it. In my example of the Arderial swarm with Shimmer, I also had Storm Ring, Aerial Flist, and Brannix to give the deck a strong attack theme. There was even some Flutter Yups in the deck to go with that. This outlined much of how the deck was supposed to achieve victory over the opposing deck. In fact, it worked so well, that it might be of interest to know the opposing swarm I had built this to crush miserably was a defensive Weave swarm deck. So miserable was the match up, that after Kesia went down, Shimmer ended the turn with over forty energy in creatures under her control. For those of us that enjoy Star Wars, that was definitely a darkside moment for me. Not only had I built a counter swarm deck, it had crushed the opponent&#8217;s deck in the very area it should&#8217;ve been strong.<br />
<br />
There are several ways to turn a mere swarm into a true fighting force. It is usually a good idea to have something planned to do with your desired swarm. A swarm that simply exists may just sit there waiting for that Ormagon or Cataclysm. The swarm that takes action may avoid such mass destruction cards for a few turns by forcing opponents to use their energy and cards to defend themselves in the here and now. Some swarm decks might simply attack and heal the creatures towards this end, while others use spells, powers, or effects to achieve their goals. Zungg Swarm and Makoor are great examples of cards that can utilize a Bograth swarm to devastate an opponent. Meanwhile, a Cald swarm might try to make great use of Ergar and a Scroll of Fire, or The Last Words. The other regions also tend to have one way or another that they can utilize a swarm, and even Bograth has more tricks than the two I listed here. So many and varied are the possibilities, I do not even want to try and list them. Just remember that your swarm deck needs to be proactive in one way or another, even the defensive Weave swarm can use Jumbor or Zaya&#8217;s Bow to take a more active stance.<br />
<br />
Now there is one little additional trick that I have used that has not been mentioned so far. Sometimes, a swarm is created over several turns. Since the creatures will have to survive several turns before a swarm can be established, it usually helps for them to be tough. This is usually best when combined with any of the other tricks to swarming, but is a common staple of decks that swarm with larger creatures. The incredible defenses or energy tricks of Weave creatures, as well as the invulnerability of many Kybar&#8217;s Teeth creatures, are great examples of toughened creatures that might survive several turns on their own. Such a deck will look even more like a normal deck until it has completely unfolded and revealed itself as the swarm deck it was built to be. In fact, this final form of swarming tends to be found drifting in a limbo between swarm decks and performing like a more conventional deck.<br />
<br />
If there is any one point I hope you remember from this article as you choose to build a swarm deck, it would be to build a forty card deck with over half of it being creatures. This is perhaps the first and most important ingredient in building a swarm. As such, a swarm deck isn&#8217;t much different than a normal deck with creatures. It is the tricks used that often make the little difference between a deck that swarms, and a deck that is just heavy on the creatures. Saving energy on your creatures, generating some extra energy to play them with, or simply using cheap creatures are some basic ways to turn a deck that is heavy on the creatures into a deck that frequently and successfully swarms. The method, or combination of methods, will determine how much card draw the swarm deck needs for relative success. Once the deck swarms, it is up to the player how to actually utilize it. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=5110&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
