I can&#8217;t remember which region he was playing at the time, but it wasn&#8217;t suiting him well. His friend with a defensive Weave deck was stomping on his deck like none other. It seemed like there was no way for him to get through his friend&#8217;s defenses. I told him that many regions can be quite successful and that a region specializing in spells and powers could deal with the problem he faced, but he just wanted something aggressive enough to take on his friend&#8217;s deck plus some. So, I continued by telling him that he might be surprised if he took his friend&#8217;s preferred region and used it to attack instead of defend.<br />
<br />
After a brief demonstration of the aggressive Weave, I offered to write on a piece of paper good creatures, spells, and relics to collect to build his deck with. Over the next couple months, it seemed as if I was constantly plagued by questions on how he could make his deck as aggressive as my own Weave deck. No longer did he lose to his friend. Now, his goal was to stand toe-to-toe with mine. Little did he know, that as I observed his games, and analyzed his deck, that the deck itself was nearly a match for some of my own. All he needed to improve was his strategy of what to attack with which creature and when. As to the chances that he&#8217;ll play anything other than Weave after this.... very slim. It probably won&#8217;t be aggressive enough for him.<br />
<br />
There are two types of Weave players, locally. Both sides of the fence seek out Kesia as a preferred magi, but it is their styles that are radically different. On the normal side of the fence, we have those that love the Grass Hyren, Lascinth, and Speag. There are many that dread the defensive Weave decks, with their annoying creatures that put up incredible defenses, and spells and powers that demand you attack them. Still, several players have learned to deal with this annoyance. Yet, they still fear the Weave. Not the defensive anymore, but the aggressive Weave. For while the defensive Weave builds impressive walls, the aggressive Weave storms across the field in a thunderous charge. Weave players on this side of the fence tend to adore the Junjertrug, Seaweed Lascinth, and The Hunt.<br />
<br />
Okay, so why can Weave played aggressively inspire fear? Aren&#8217;t the tricks of the Weave best when defending? Yes and no. What of all the creatures that can&#8217;t attack? Keep them to a minimum. Very minimal. In fact, the only creature I would recommend for an aggressive Weave deck that actually can&#8217;t attack is the Uwamar, and only if the majority of your other creatures can Weave.<br />
<br />
How does aggressive Weave work? Simple. Attack. The more efficient you are, the better. So, gaining energy can be helpful, as well as reducing your energy loss. You won&#8217;t need to borrow much from other regions, if at all (depends on the deck). In fact, Arderial and Core are the regions this type of deck is most likely to splash. Shockwave and Stealth can be great cards to add in, unless you are using the afore mentioned Kesia who can&#8217;t play non-Weave spells. In fact, before Seaweed Lascinth, Stealth was one of the best ways for an aggressive Weave deck to be efficient, especially when combined with The Hunt for multiple energy saving strikes in the same turn.<br />
<br />
So far, I have mentioned Seaweed Lascinth, Junjertrug, Stealth, and The Hunt. These are all good cards for this type of deck. In the Voice of the Storm, Weave Seed was added to that mix. Still, two creatures and three spells isn&#8217;t much to work off of when trying to make the aggressive Weave. Fortunately, the combination with The Hunt and Stealth can work with most Weave creatures. And, when you weave to them, if possible, it can be downright efficient in disposing of opposing creatures. Currently, Weave Seed works with any Weave creature, so it can be absolutely deadly. This one reason I suggest such a deck avoid having many Weave creatures that cannot attack.<br />
<br />
With this apparent dependence on a very few cards, it can be very important to have card draw, or a way to search for cards. If running with the Junjertrugs, then the complementing horn becomes a powerful tool. Also, Drowls and Vuryips offer some card draw. Combined with Gia&#8217;s Tome, a single Drowl might draw a big chunk of the deck over just a few turns. Both the Drowl and Vuryip can Weave as well. So, they make great additions to the deck, whether weaving from them to your more valued attackers, or to them when using either of them as your weapon of choice.<br />
<br />
In some ways, this concept is another key to aggressive Weave&#8211;any creature you control that can attack is something you can use as a weapon. This is also why some of our &#8220;stronger&#8221; players still fear and respect the Weave. A standard Weave, or defensive, if you know how to do it, you can gut much of their defenses by removing select creatures. Aggressive Weave, you can&#8217;t leave anything standing, or you can count on it coming to haunt you in deadly force.<br />
<br />
So, why did I recommend Uwamar for aggressive Weave? Simply free energy. You use one, or several, of Weave&#8217;s tricks to move energy off the Uwamar to any of your other creatures. The options include weave, re-weave, and even Kesia&#8217;s Flute. As long as you play any of your other Weave creatures, Uwamar grows. While you could use Rayje&#8217;s Belt to turn the Uwamar into &#8220;something ugly comes their way,&#8221; the Uwamar should be just fine as a great defensive barrier and energy battery for your other creatures. Also, since Uwamar can&#8217;t normally attack, its own weave effect doesn&#8217;t refer to attacking at all, only defending.<br />
<br />
While Yajo may seem like a great addition, it cannot attack. As I said earlier, keep non-attacking creatures to a minimum&#8211;very minimal. In other words, four or five at the very most. If running three Uwamars for their nearly guaranteed free energy, then I suggest only one or two Yajo, if any. The reverse is true if using three Yajo.<br />
<br />
Currently, I suggest the aggressive Weave deck run between twenty-four to twenty-seven creatures. Not only would this work nicely with Uwamars, if you use them, but it ensures that you have plenty of creatures to toss down. Remember, the aggressive Weave needs creatures that can attack in play before their own attack step. It shouldn&#8217;t take opponents long to learn that anything such a deck has in play that can attack is a danger and a threat to them. In this case, a big selection of creatures can keep them constantly stretching to prevent any of them from &#8220;getting through.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Now, it might be a little surprising to find that some of Weave&#8217;s apparently defensive cards work nicely in an aggressive Weave deck. A few of these include the Zassyfur and Pody, as both of these creatures can attack if you feel so inclined. They do not have that restriction. In an aggressive Weave deck, Tropical Jumbor will probably rarely see its own effect, but that free energy can still help every now and then. It, too, can attack. Combined with other tricks to make sure it has an even amount of energy at the end of the turn, Stumbling Junjertrug can be a great ally in these decks as well. The list goes on for the creatures, with the biggest criteria being that they can attack.<br />
<br />
Would it surprise you if I said that I usually use at least one Sawgrass in my aggressive Weave deck? I used to use Shockwave. I guess I had a desire for purity. That, and Kesia couldn&#8217;t play Shockwave, so I really didn&#8217;t have much choice. In the end, Sawgrass replaced Shockwave, and worked. Why? Because, more often than not, they had to use something to beat the previous magi. Sawgrass also can keep an opponent fearful and on the defensive, which is where an aggressive Weave deck wants them. Brushfire is then for softening up the opposition, eliminating Bwills, and harassing Pylofufs.<br />
<br />
I realize that most players on DeckTech have probably already chosen regions and playing styles. Also, a player that is good at defensive Weave may not do as well with its opposite. In fact, the two styles can be quite different, and I do not recommend playing aggressive Weave if you prefer the defensive Weave. For those that like the standard, defensive Weave, I suggest you splash very small numbers of any of the things I may have suggested here. Why? Do not compromise your defense to build this offense! And, the reverse can be true as well for those that want to turn this region on its head. I have been playing Weave this way since a couple months after Dream&#8217;s End, as I was getting really frustrated trying to learn to play defensive Weave. At that time, I chose to turn it around and play it the way I wanted to, instead of the way it seemed to be designed to work. And, to my delight, not only did I find out that the deck could work, it was absolutely brutal.<br />
<br />
So why did I write this article? A couple reasons. For starters, the most recent tournament I was in, I forgot to take notes. Otherwise, I would be writing a tournament report, since I think we need more of those. This is not the only reason, however. Not long ago, I saw a deck that someone had mixed Weave and Paradwyn together because they felt Weave didn&#8217;t offer good attack options. I almost fell out of my chair in disbelief. Shortly after, I posted another of my decks based on the aggressive Weave, and sadly devoted a lot of the strategy section covering how to play this seemingly unusual style of Weave. The article within the strategy should&#8217;ve been separate from the deck.<br />
