Energy is a good thing.  Removing all your opponents energy is a good thing.  Creatures put energy on your side of the table, and remove it from your opponents side of the table.  Hey these creature cards are pretty useful.  More specifically, players began to realize that most deck archetypes needed about 50% creatures to perform, and spells and relics were more to support those creatures than anything else.<br />
<br />
On occasion some of the more courageous players (or naive, your choice) ventured into the realm of creatureless decks.  Cald jumps out as a region made just for this purpose, as many players paralleled the fiery realm to the red color in Magic the Gathering.  But just how feasible is a creatureless deck in the current environment?  More specifically, a creatureless deck that can compete with the best of the best.  The answer?  Not very.  However, this article will examine just how close we can come to a competitive less-creature deck and abandon the typical (and often bland) ratio of twenty creatures, twelve spells, eight relics.<br />
<br />
First and foremost on the list of questions about a less-creature deck is why?  Why in the world would anyone want to blow all their energy on spells and relics and leave their magi vulnerable to the onslaught of opposing creatures?  Some of you may have noticed a sudden surge of decks in your area that made you wish you had a spell which allowed you to destroy any one creature that used to be yours.  Thats right- Akido, and about five decks (of varying regions and builds) I can think off the top of my head all either take control of your creatures or use them against themselves, all for less energy than you spent to play your creatures.  <br />
<br />
When playing against decks like these (and if you ask me decks like these will be around forever more in the world of Magi-Nation) you find yourself wishing your deck didnt need creatures to win.  Another reason many players might want to play a less-creature deck is the simple principle of variation.  Just coming up with something different is a top priority for many players, and decks with five to six creatures are definitely dark waters for most.<br />
<br />
The next problem with less-creature decks is card advantage.  It doesnt take a rockect scientist to realize that if it takes Boojoe two spells to get rid of one of Jarrods creatures, Boojoe is going to run out of cards before Jarrod.  This simple fact introduces the first two key ingredients of a less-creautre deck:<font color=&quot;red&quot;> a) The Draw Engine</font>, and <font color=&quot;purple&quot;>b) The Mass Removal</font>.   It is critical that a deck that isnt going to keep its energy on the board always has access to a large hand, therefore having answers to anything an opponent can throw at you.  You need to outdraw your opponent, and you need to outdraw them by a large amount.  <br />
<br />
The Draw Engine must also be a consistent means of drawing cards; including one Book of the Ages in your less-creature Cald deck isnt going to give you the cards you need to win.  Examples of stable Draw Engines include, but are not limited to:  <br />
<br />
<i>Secrets of the Book :</i> Because one use of this relic almost always nets you three or more cards, three of this card is a staple in most Core players&#39; eyes.  Less-creature or not, decks that can access this card will outdraw their opponents and have their deck in their hands in no time.<br />
<br />
<i>Bubble Xyx :</i> Draw three cards?  Wow, thats always good.  Many Orothe decks (including Akido) place OQua in the first position only to abuse the Bubble Xyx for a turn or two.  Ask anyone whos seen it, youll have your deck in your hands in no time.<br />
<br />
<i>Karak Necklace :</i> This relic is what gives Orothe the consistent hand advantage post-setup, and allows you to draw into your deck multiple times each turn (a valuable asset).<br />
<br />
<i>Gorgles Glasses :</i> In my opinion this relic makes most Cald decks better, but in a Cald less-creature theme it is essential.  Suddenly Wildfire nets you three more cards from your deck in addition to killing three creatures, and those three cards may net you more cards and more cards until youve destroyed every opposing creature.<br />
<br />
<i>Crushing Winds :</i> As an Arderial player, this is one of my favorite cards.  Discarding four energy to kill a creature is just an added bonus to drawing two cards, and you will find yourself drawing into answers left and right.  Added to this cards drawing power is the fact that Arderial has many ways to thin its deck of creatures and relics, meaning that drawing two cards with the Winds usually puts you in place for a Shockwave or Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<i>Agovo :</i> While this is probably the weakest example of a generalized consistent draw engine, the Agovo more represents any creature that stays in play and nets you cards.  Weave has many of these creatures, and including creatures in your deck that draw you more cards is always a good draw engine for a less-creature deck.<br />
<br />
Now for the second ingredient, the Mass Removal.  This is as much a part of card advantage of The Draw Engine because it involves using one of your cards to remove more than one of your opponents.  Any deck that plans on winning with few creatures will need to do better than card for a card or else the one time your opponent sneeks a card by you cant deal with you are doomed.  Examples from various regions of The Mass Removal are:<br />
<br />
<i>Wildfire :</i> If you ask me, a staple for Cald.  Two in most decks and three in less-creature variants, this card (especially in conjunction with Scroll of Fire) will destroy whole armies in some matchups and severely weaken them in others.<br />
<br />
<i>Thunderquake :</i> You will find this card in so many decks because its versatility makes it a good Mass Removal for most regions.  Its variable cost means it can destroy one large creature, two to three medium creatures, or a whole lot of little ones.  This card embodies card advantage at its greatest, and proves just how important card advantage is in any deck, let alone less-creature decks.<br />
<br />
<i>Core Grag :</i> Good for Core and great for Cald, this card not only acts like a Wildfire against the opponent but also a direct hit on the magi!  Whoa!  I love this guy, he has won me a lot of games, and is a good example of Mass Removal.<br />
<br />
<i>Rockslide Hyren/ Stone Storm :</i> Who says Kybars Teeth doesnt get any love?  Stone Storm is a nice one for two deal and Rockslide is a one for three.  Pretty neat :)<br />
<br />
<i>Cataclysm :</i> Mr. Mass Removal himself, this card has set the tone for many playing environments and provided a whole new obstacle for deck builders.  Players now have to watch the amount of energy on their magi with even more care, as going to 0 could spell instant doom with the wave of the Cataclysm hand.  This card really boosted Arderials capabilities in the current environment because it allows it to deal with Swarm and Paradwyn huge energy decks as well as few creature decks (with Shockwave).<br />

This brings us to the third ingredient for less-creature decks, and this ingredient is what keeps me from using the one word creatureless:<font color=&quot;red&quot;> c) The Creature Base</font>.  Wait a minute, you say, isnt that paradoxical?  How can one of the crucial elements of a less-creature deck be the Creature Base?  When I say Creature Base, I am not simply referring to the creatures, I am referring to the way in which your creatures complement your spell or relic theme, and how you make that selection of creatures consistent.<br />
<br />
For example, while some players may dismiss Barak the Red as a good magi for less-creature Cald decks because his power deals with creatures, this actually makes him a very suitable magi for less-creature decks.  This is because his power allows you to play with only seven or eight stable creatures (like Braggle and Granas) and fetch them from the deck, rather than play twenty to ensure you draw them.  Similar magi for less-creature themes include Liriel, Arawan, Delia, and Koll.  They all have abilities that can fetch creatures to a certain extent and allow you to play less because of their consistency.  <br />
<br />
Another important duty of The Creature Base is protection.  In less-creature decks, you will constantly die if you are run over by the opponents creatures (duh!).  Therefore, creatures like Braggle, Granas, Flutter Yup, Mydra, and Pylofuf are good options to protect from swarms while using your spells or relics to deal with the opponents threats.  Another important thing to remember is how well the creatures will withstand discard, making creatures like Crystal Parmalag or Colossus strong options of less-creature decks.  The main thing to remember is that its good to have a few creatures in play for both offense and defense during the course of the game even if they arent the point of your deck.  Having a Granas in play really takes some of the pressure off a Cald player, as they now only have to deal with the opposing creatures that they want to that turn, rather than find an aswer or die.<br />
<br />
Next ingredient : <font color=&quot;blue&quot;>d) The Win Condition</font>.  While all decks need this, less-creature decks sometimes need to be more creative in their win conditions, since the majority of decks use creatures to defeat opposing magi.  Whether it be Maelstrom plus mass removal or Awakening plus Shadow Geysers, or perhaps just including three of a strong creature (like Colossus) and a couple UmmNos, youve got to have some way to defeat all three opposing magi.  Examples include:<br />
<br />
<i>Awakening :</i> This card screams less-creature deck, since the only reason for creatures would be to play the Shadow Geysers.<br />
<br />
<i>Abraxins Crown + Cald Direct Damage :</i> This is the reason Abraxins Crown is in less-creature Cald themes- after youve removed all the energy off opposing creatures you can Syphon Vortex or Boomstick the opponent to death.<br />
<br />
<i>Hubdras Spear :</i> This card isnt exactly a win condition, but it is certainly part of the winning technique for Orothe control themes that can remove all opposing creatures.  This card ensures that the three to four creatures you do play are able to defeat an opposing magi after your spells and relics have done the trick.<br />
<br />
<i>Colossus : </i>This guy represents all big and burly creatures who have some means of protecting themselves and winning you the game.  While he is still vulnerable to some things (like direct damage), he is a good solid wall from behind which to fire spells like Undertow and Tidal Wave, and you can check out decks like The Little Mermaid to see when he is an appropriate win condition.<br />
<br />
Now that weve looked at the four basic ingredients to starting your less-creature deck from scratch, lets take a look at some of the different regions and the likelihood and/or reasons for making a less-creature deck from that region.<br />
<br />
<b>Arderial :</b> Arderial is actually a potent region for less-creature options.  It has many great spells and relics which make a it a logical choice for a spell control theme.  One option that Ive built used Lady of the Sky/ Lasada/ Elios with Shockwave, Eclipse, Storm Cloud, Crushing Winds, Cataclysm, Maelstrom Flask, and the Heart and Hand of the Sky.  The Draw Engine included Crushing Winds, Lasadas effect, and search cards like Warlum, and Maelstrom Flask provided a means to search through the deck and play removal spells for cheap (like Cataclsym for 5!).  The Mass Removal was Cataclysms and direct removal up the wazoo, and the Creature Base included Vashps that could discard energy from smaller creatures while the spells took out the big kahoonas.  The decks weak point was the Win Condition.  It had no other way to defeat the opposing magi than the few control creatures and some Xyxs, and any opponent who just sat there and let their magi gain energy was out of range.<br />
<br />
<b>Bograth : </b>As of right now I cant see too many reasons why you would want to try a less-creature theme with Bograth.  The region is geared mainly towards creature swarm, and most of the spells and relics complement this theme.<br />
<br />
<b>Cald :</b> This is one of the most logical solutions for less-creature themes.  For the Draw Engine, include cards like Gorgles Glasses or a Krawg or two.  Cald has access to some nice Mass Removal like Wildfire and Flame Geyser, but three Thunderquakes are near staple for Cald less-creature themes.   A nice Creature Base would be Braggles and Granas, since you can let them sit protected while you blast away at the opponent with your spells and still have someone to attack with.  A Flame Rudwot or two is also nice since you can play him once and heal your Granas and burn your opponent.  For the Win Condition, you will either need to include Abraxins Crown or magi-hitting spells, and these are also backed up by the creature base, which can pull out the win if they play something like Entangle on you.  Good magi for less-creature Cald decks include Barak the Red, Barak, Vorga, Good ol Ashgar, Valkan, and Amanax.<br />
<br />
<b>Core :</b> There are a couple possibilities for less-creature themes with the core.  Secrets of the Book is one of the best Draw Engines in the game, and starting the Dark Twins gives you immediate hand advantage.  One of the reasons you may wish to play a less-creature Core deck is to abuse the stealing cards like Corrupt and Turn, therefore a good Draw Engine also includes Warradas Ring and Tomes of the Great Library.  Harror is also a less-creature theme waiting to happen, since every time she plays a spell she can take an opposing creature or magi closer to death.  The Mass Removal includes cards like Core Grag or Darkbreeds Minion, and the list gets much larger considering the Dark Twins can start with Entomb.  The creature base includes creatures that can either discard energy or make themselves larger, so Raveled Drush, Darkbreeds Minion, Corathan, Dark Ayebaw, and Core Grag are all logical choices.  The Win Condition could be something like Awakening, or in the corrupting theme it could be attacking the opponent with their own creatures.  Logical magi for Core less-creature decks are Evil Evu, Agram, Togoth, Warrada, the Dark Twins, Harror, and Morag.<br />
<br />
<b>Kybars Teeth :</b> Believe it or not Kybars Teeth does have some viable less-creature themes.  While they are not very strong because Kybars Teeth lacks a powerful Draw Engine, they do have access to a wide variety of useful removal spells and creatures like Stone Storm, Rockslide Hyren, Jagged Rocks, Rock Slide, Vertigo, and Ballistic Baldar.  A possible Draw Engines would include Book of the Ages or Tommorows Jewel for card advantage, and Mass Removal includes all the things I just mentioned.  The Creature Base includes the few removal creatures and also a few solid defensive creatures like Mosp and Sagawal.  The Win Condition will most likely be the few creatures in the deck after youve destroyed all the opposing creatures, and Tlok and Giant Baldar are nice victory helpers.  Good magi for less-creature KT decks include Shapers Apprentice, Kygn, Tlok, Koll, Ullig, Wessig, and Hok.<br />
<br />
<b>Naroom :</b> Unfortunately this region, like Bograth, focuses a lot on creatures, and while there probably are a few viable less-creature themes most of them are just not logical or competitve.  If you can think of one, kudos to you, but I really cant think of any reason Id want to play a less-creature Naroom deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Orothe :</b> This region is up there with Cald for most logically less-creature.  Its got nice removal spells and control cards.  Possible Draw Engines include starting Oqua for Bubble Xyx, using Bria for Secrets of the Book and Warradas Ring, or playing steal themes and using Karak Necklace.  Corathan provides nice card advantage here as well.  For Mass Removal, spells like Tidal Wave and Undertow are at your fingertips, and the creatures also help to this end.  The creature base includes creatures that will assist whichever Orothe theme you chose (let me explain).  For steal decks, Abaquists, River Abaquists, and Corathans make up the majority of your creatures.  For control themes you will want to include things like Wellisk, Phrup, Deep Wellisk, Bog Wellisk, and Hurricane Orish.  Interchange themes will obviously need Giant Parthin :).  For the Win Condition, Ive already mentioned Hubdras Spear and Maelstrom, and Orothes high energize rates can abuse undiscardable creatures like Colossus and Deep Wellisk.  Good magi for Orothe less-creature themes are: Oqua, Bria, Quilla, Arosa, MRika, Shapers Apprentice, and Mobis.<br />
<br />
<b>Paradwyn :</b> While you probably could make a less-creature theme with Paradwyn at the time, it just isnt logical yet.  Paradywn, like Naroom and Bograth, draws its strength from its creatures and most less-creature themes you could make with Paradwyn would be made better with more creatures.  If you did want to make a less-creature theme, you could use magi like Liriel and Arawan since they can fetch creatures from the deck, and then just include a few creatures for them to keep getting.<br />
<br />
<b>Underneath : </b>Underneath actually shows a lot of promise in the less-creature department.  Because most of their creatures have a way of sticking around (ahem, Burrow), the Underneath magi has many ways of sitting behind a wall of one or two creatures whilst the blast away at the opponent.  If Underneath gets a really strong Draw Engine in the next set I think were in for a new tier 1 deck archetype.  As is, Vogo is a good option for the player who wants to draw more cards, and Tommorows Jewel and Book of the Ages are open for everyones enjoyment.  Mass Removal shines here, since Underneath can play both Ormagon and Thunderquake with no regional penalty.  Crushing Fungus is SOME GOOD in less-creature themes, as are Bottomless Pit and Resonate.  The Creature Base may include some solid wall creatures (similar to Cald) like Pylofuf and Granas, and youll definitely also want Ormagon to clear the board.  For the Win Condition, Impact is one of my favorite magi finishers, or you can also ride your two to three creatures home after youve removed all the opposing creautres.  Solid magi for less-creature themes include Fossik, Ringsmith , Gyrg, Trygar, Gogor, Motash, and Radget.<br />
<br />
<b>Weave:</b> This region is another one of those you could, but why? regions.  Most of its power lies in its creatures (both offensive and defensives themes exist), and because its Draw Engines are mainly creatures and its removal is reliant on attacking or defending, I wouldnt suggest going for a less-creature theme at this point with the Weave.<br />
<br />
And there you have it, my view on less-creature themes in the current environment.  Some are more competitive than others, some are logical while some would be better off with more creatures, but most importantly its something different.  I hope youve found something useful in my article- maybe a new idea or maybe youll now decide to venture into a less-creature theme.  Youll notice that in my article I didnt include much about combo decks, which are usually less-creature.  Thats because I feel that combo decks need a whole article to themselves, and if I started talking about them this article would be 23590 pages long.  <br />
