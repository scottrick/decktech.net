Others do not. As someone who sometimes swarms with his creatures, I am going to try and address how you might deal with an opposing swarm. There are several methods I have used. Some may be better than others. Usually, it depends on the deck and region you are using.<br />
<br />
There are three basic methods I plan to present here. The first is a common practice for dealing with opposing swarms, or mass creature destruction. It is also possible to try and build a counter swarm, which can be a fun or mean thing to do. Or, you can take it on a bit at a time in a piecemeal effort. Each of these methods can be combined in one form or another.<br />
<br />
Mass Destruction<br />
<br />
One of the more common methods is to use a mass destruction card. A couple of most popular cards for this is the Ormagon (Underneath) and Cataclysm (Arderial). A couple other regions have a similar card or two. By using mass-destruction, you dispose of the opposing creatures in a single move, often using only one card. This can level the playing field, or creating a much needed opening in the opposing player&#8217;s defenses.<br />
<br />
However, there are usually high costs associated with these cards. In the case of the Ormagon and Cataclysm, this is an in-region cost of ten energy, often requiring a fresh magi to pull it off. In addition Cataclysm can cost the casting player all the cards in their hand (sorry&#8211;Climbing Staff and associated cards usually say &#8220;opposing&#8221; cards, so they can&#8217;t stop this), and Ormagon&#8217;s power targets all non-Underneath creatures.<br />
<br />
I do not recommend Cataclysm for non-Core/non-Arderial decks. Unless this is the opponent&#8217;s last magi, and the spell will defeat their magi, ditching your hand of every non-Core/non-Arderial card can devastate you more than Cataclysm hurts the opponent. They&#8217;ll usually still have plenty to choose from, while you probably have nothing.<br />
<br />
As for the Ormagon, it is one of the better mass destruction cards. That is, until it faces an opposing Underneath deck. Out of region, instead of discarding your hand, it will discard all of your non-Underneath creatures from play. This is usually avoided by using Warrior&#8217;s Boots and a fresh magi. By playing it before any other creatures are played, and using its power then as well, it is possible to still play out a few more creatures and not have them destroyed.<br />
<br />
Flip-kill decks often accompany one of these mass destruction cards with something that removes energy from an opposing magi. A potentially nasty trick, it may defeat an opposing magi in one turn. However, this usually requires a fresh magi with plenty of energy to burn. A flip-kill deck not only uses a lot of it energy to play the more expensive mass destruction card, the magi will also spend a little more on another spell/creature/power to remove energy from the opposing magi. In many ways, a flip-kill deck is perhaps weakest Warrior&#8217;s Boots and other speed methods that can hurt a depleted magi.<br />
<br />
While I used Ormagons for a long while, I&#8217;ve actually stopped using mass destruction cards much anymore. However, a few related cards are among some of my top recommendations. These cards usually aren&#8217;t mass destruction cards anywhere near the scale of the Ormagon or Cataclysm, but tend to be fairly efficient cards on their own. One example of this is the Core Grag, which I often recommend to both Core and Cald players.<br />
<br />
Counter Swarm<br />
<br />
Instead of using mass destruction to deal with an opposing swarm, you can attempt to build your own swarm of creatures. Many of the regions can easily place out overwhelming swarms of their own. Naroom, Bograth, Paradwyn, and Weave are some of the more common ones. The other regions can swarm as well, but it will vary in difficulty to do this.<br />
<br />
In this scenario, he who builds the bigger swarm faster often wins. This applies to both you and your opponent. To win using this method, your creatures should outnumber/outgrow your opponent&#8217;s creatures. It is either that, or the deck with the better trick to their swarm. While a few of my decks have used a counter swarm, it is not something I frequently rely upon. Its strength is also its weakness. If your swarm doesn&#8217;t outperform their swarm, you will easily lose. Also, the swarm may not be enough. For example, a Bograth swarm could easily be combined with Darkness to deal with an opposing swarm. Or someone confident that it won&#8217;t impact their swarm too much might field Equilibrate to deal with anyone who can outgrow theirs.<br />
<br />
The first time I really used a counter swarm was my first Shimmer deck (posted as Shimmer&#8217;s Dangerous Smile&#8211;the precursor to the &#8220;adept&#8221; deck I later built). I did it because one of our local Weave players, and a good one too, was thrashing his opponents with a Kesia swarm. Even though he could&#8217;ve defeated their magi several turns ago, Kesia would have an impressive swarm that only an Ormagon or Cataclysm could deal with before he would defeat a magi. Personally, I thought this a mean thing to do to his opponents (the part of waiting until he had an overwhelming swarm that none of their magi could handle). Personally, I would take out his swarm in a piecemeal effort and could usually defeat it, but I wanted to build a swarm bigger and faster than his deck could in an attempt to let him see what it was like sitting on the other side of the fence. When I finally got the opportunity to play him again, that Shimmer deck did the job. By the time the game was over, Shimmer had such an impressive swarm that not only did Kesia fold under the pressure, but he was the one wishing for an Ormagon/Cataclysm because his fresh magi didn&#8217;t even start with half as much energy as Shimmer controlled in creatures.<br />
<br />
Again, as a reminder, the weakness of counter swarming is also its strength. Its strength is making a swarm. The weakness is a better swarm, mass destruction, or falling to piecemeal tactics.<br />
<br />
Piecemeal<br />
<br />
This is just as it implies. You take out the opposing swarm a piece at a time. Each turn, you try and eliminate at least one more creature that your opponent controls. The goal is to never to let the swarm get established. If this cannot be prevented, whittle away at the swarm until it is gone. Especially for decks that rely on building that swarm, if you keep the numbers down, it might never get out of your range to handle.<br />
<br />
Most swarms take several turns to become established. Essentially, if you keep it from becoming established, it might not ever get there. This is not guaranteed to beat an opposing swarm. However, this is often the easiest method for most decks to handle an opposing swarm without splashing mass destruction cards.<br />
<br />
It is for this reason I fear only a few Bograth decks. Most Bograth decks either want lots of creatures to make the Mist Hyren cheap, or to use some other trick that also checks for vast numbers of creatures. By simply eliminating as many creatures as I can each turn, I prevent my opponent from generating that swarm they need when checking for their spells/powers/effects. Since many of my decks excel when attacking, this can end up being most of their swarm each turn until I manage to have enough creatures or &#8220;tricks&#8221; to take out the magi as well. Not only does this tactic make it difficult for the Bograth player to establish their swarm to a point where I cannot handle it anymore, it also prevents them from having enough creatures in play at any one point to make their combo cards extremely powerful. In other words, not only is their swarm kept trimmed down, so is their potential to do harm.<br />
<br />
A piecemeal effort can easily be combined with creating your own counter swarm. Instead of merely building your own impressive swarm, you divide your efforts between removing pieces of their swarm and building yours. This is usually how I use Bograth, Paradwyn, and any of my own swarm decks. In fact, some of my non-swarm decks will end up swarming against a swarm deck because they can excel at piecemeal tactics, allowing my magi to keep it up turn after turn until I have the swarm instead.<br />
<br />
Each of these different strategies has its weak point. In the case of piecemeal, it can come in two basic flavors. If you cannot keep up the effort, the opposing swarm may escape from your grasp and it becomes much more powerful than you can possibly handle. Also, there are a few swarm decks that establish the swarm quickly and easily. Piecemeal tactics can be used to try and bring a full strength swarm back down to manageable levels, but it becomes more costly and harder to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, mass destruction, counter swarm, and piecemeal are three different ways to deal with opposing swarms. These are all fairly good methods. And while I might not use the big mass destruction cards like Ormagon and Cataclysm much anymore, they have many smaller cousins I might recommend for almost any deck, depending on the central region of course. As for myself, I tend to prefer a combination of counter swarm and piecemeal tactics to deal with the opposing swarms I face. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=4901&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
