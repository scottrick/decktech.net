He was looking for a list of one or two specific cards. He played Naroom, so I suggested he drop the Shockwaves for Giant Carillion, and maybe he should add Garan. Personally, I don&#8217;t think he liked these answers. These changes would&#8217;ve required he change his playing style. And, that is why I suggested them. While many cards appear to offer quick fixes to the challenge of burrow decks, most of them are easily countered in one way or another. The way I beat burrow most of the time is through attrition. Yes, instead of shutting off the burrow, I suggest using your head (and some strategy) to encourage them to run out of options.<br />
<br />
The common answers to burrow is Rayje&#8217;s Sword, Rayje&#8217;s Belt, or Shockwave. All three of these choices are relatively easy for the Underneath deck to counter. Inhibitor Band stops a lot more than just these couple relic problems, it also works against Relic Stalker, Water of Life, Robes of the Ages, Warrior&#8217;s Boots, and the list goes on. Meanwhile, &#8220;Umm...No!&#8221; and Grakanden can provide some protection against spells that discard creatures. And, don&#8217;t forget Underneath has some of its own spells and powers that can discard creatures or relics.<br />
<br />
So far, it might seem like each card to deal with burrow is balanced out by a matching card to counter it. This is as it should be. It is strategy, or using the another road that can bypass the burrowed creatures. An example of another road is spells and powers that return a creature to a players hand instead. Sure, they&#8217;ll have it again. But, it isn&#8217;t in the way right now, is it? Or, what of creatures like Giant Carillion? My friend might not have wanted to use it, but there isn&#8217;t much the burrow deck can do about that power.<br />
<br />
Still, the way I usually beat burrow is by using my head and keeping calm, and sometimes my opponents probably think I am just being stubborn (part truth). The problem with burrowed creatures is that the energy they can lose from spells, powers, and attacks each turn is capped at two energy&#8211;total. Too many players will stop here and wait for the Shockwaves, or a Rayje&#8217;s Sword. Time spent waiting for these cards are turns the Underneath player is also gathering their options, some that may counter these same cards.<br />
<br />
I have used attrition to beat several burrow decks. Attrition can gain you much. It may even be painful to do it, but you want those burrowed creatures to lose that two energy each turn you can manage it. As the wall withers, the Underneath player may find they are on borrowed time. A Pylofuf under pressure might only last three of your turns if the player doesn&#8217;t toss down another card to &#8220;heal&#8221; it. Sure, it will hurt when they do this. Keep up the pressure. Ideal methods for pressing on are spells, powers, and/or attacks that only cost you close to the same two energy as they will lose. The more the burrow deck is kept defending itself, the more it should be using its cards to save itself from the onslaught instead of saving them for later. If you can also remove energy from their magi despite a burrowed creature or two in play, even better. This forces them to play out their less costly cards since they&#8217;ll probably only have their energize to work with. Quite often, these are the cards you want to be used up. Playing big cards when they flip a magi usually means less energy for them to play out that annoying wall of burrowed creatures for you to dig through again. As I said, it is about strategy.<br />
<br />
This tactic probably sounds odd, and you might have trouble believing it can work. So, I will use a couple examples. One from a while back, before Nightmare&#8217;s Dawn, and the other a bit more recently.<br />
<br />
Now, for the first example, I used a Cald deck in a tournament and placed second. The first place player was using a burrow deck, but we had never actually played against each other in that tournament. The turnout had been much better back then than it has been the last several months, and we were actually &#8220;rated&#8221; by our tournament director by how many of our magi went undefeated. Since more people had beaten my first or second magi, I came up a bit short of him. However, I claimed that I would&#8217;ve beaten his deck if we had played. It wasn&#8217;t an idle challenge, and he took me up on it. So, although it wasn&#8217;t officially a part of the tournament, I trounced his deck with only my first two magi. How? Simple attrition. Each turn I would use Fireball, Spark from the Ergars with a Scroll of Fire in play, or anything that would take two energy off his burrowed creature(s). Each turn, two more. Occasionally, he would heal it. Now, Giant Arboll was in that deck, so I recovered energy a bit with this creature. I also knew that without attacking with his burrowed creatures, he couldn&#8217;t touch my Ergars with spells while they were protected by Nara (my second Magi). Eliminating any Digging Goggles was crucial to my success. So, while Nara did offer some great assist in that game, I really attribute the victory to attrition. He could not keep me at bay forever. End result, Nara with over 20 energy and a few creatures in play as well, and three Underneath magi defeated (including Gogor, who could bypass Nara&#8217;s protection with his own power). Note: there was no Rayje&#8217;s Belt or other such in that Cald deck&#8211;nothing to counter burrow.<br />
<br />
More recently, I took a Weave deck against a burrow deck. This time, it was an actual tournament game. In fact, the deck I used is listed on DeckTech as &#8220;Weave Cannonball.&#8221; Again, there is no Rayje&#8217;s Sword or Belt in the deck&#8211;nothing to specifically counter burrow. Since my Weave deck was an aggressive deck, designed to attack repeatedly, that is what I did. A good number of times I attacked and lost five energy to their two. But, I kept at it. The attrition paid off. Painful, yes. Still, it paid off. They ran out of creatures to hold me at bay. It was even a Tunnel Hyren deck. I discovered that when they played one by itself. Not because they wanted to play it solo, but because they had no choice. There was nothing left to hold me at bay. It was play the Tunnel Hyren or face defeat then. And, during that tournament, the Ormagons they used allowed them to actually get me to my third magi. However, it had taken them everything they had to do it. So, my third magi appeared, played some creatures, and the game ended on my next turn. The attrition had paid off in the end. In this case, my deck was also about energy gain (pre-Weave Seed). So, although it often was painful to attack like that, I was gaining as much energy as I could each turn.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;ll have to judge how much your deck can deal out without suffering too much for it, or how you might do it. Still, the end reward may only come when your third magi sweeps through the rest of the burrow deck, or it may not come at all this way. It is a strategy. Just like specific cards can counter or balance another card, different strategies can be used to cancel out others. Also, this tactic that has gotten me past many burrow decks is also the reason my own burrow deck is built the way it is (&#8220;Under It All&#8221;). <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php?id=4813&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
