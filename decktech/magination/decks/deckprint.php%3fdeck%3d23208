It uses the effects of Kolte to gain a constant energy advantage over the opponent. This version os somewhat more advanced, requiring good judgement and timing skills.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
The grand strategy here is to set up a bunch of Creatures and Relics in play, and a few helpful cards in your hand (Beam of Light, The Hunt, Sawgrass, Warrior&#39;s Boots etc.). When you have sufficient offense and/or defense, play Weave Minds, rotate into Kolte and let the Parting Shooting begin. Gia is mainly set up, but she usually packs enough punch to take out at least one magi by herself alone. Whatever you do, try to rotate Kolte in, you DON&#39;T want to get to Kolte by the means of Gia being defeated. His low energy makes it hard to set up an effective defense early on, but its feasible. If Kolte is defeated, Taisa is a beast magi to back you up. Her ability to weave energy off of herself makes her incredibly useful for pumping your creatures.<br>
<br><br>
And if you are low on energy, you can even use her own effect to weave energy on to her from creatures like Uwamar and Speag.  With her, you definately want to be on the offense, because she is extremely good in pumping up her little critters.  Whatever you do, try to pressurize your opponent with her, or else you will soon fall behind because your opponent is dominating the board with his attackers.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Now, as always, I&#39;ll explain individual cards below:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Uwamar: Play these guys first, in a turn or two they will become energy batteries and they can help you adjust to your energy needs accordingly.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Yajo: In  the deck to preserve your big attackers like Grass Hyren and Junjertrugs.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Pody: Just a mean creature.  He discards 3 energy for just 1, you gotta love him.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Weave Mind: In the deck to help you rotate into Kolte. Use this spell when you have set up a good offensive force with Gia, or when you&#39;re low on energy with Gia.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Sawgrass: Self explanatory, ain&#39;t it?<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Gia&#39;s Tome: Save this one for Kolte. With the Tome, Eeebit, and Bungaloo, you have at least 8-10 reusable damage every turn combined with Kolte&#39;s parting shot.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Eebit: Nice in combo with Kolte, finally a creature you don&#39;t mind sacrificing since he&#39;ll be back next turn.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Aritex: In the deck to pump back magi at the end of your turn. An excellent creature in any Weave Deck, it helps you with your energy needs. If possible, try to reuse him.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Jumbor: A 6 energy creature that forces the opponent to attack. An excellent combo with Speag and Koltes sweet sweet effects.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: Self-explanatory as well.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Quallon: Helps you with your weaving. Can be brutal with Taisa, providing 2 unexpected energy for the opponent to deal with. Fun.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
This is basically the whole thing. It may (or may not) be complicated, but once it&#39;s playtested changes can be made and the deck will be improved. I have not completed this deck yet, and hopefully I will be able to fini before the next tourney to test it in a competitive environment. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Any help and suggestions are greatly appreciated, especially by more experienced players and players who are good with Weave. I used to be, but lately I&#39;ve been trying to focus on Naroom and Bograth, so I havent had much time to improve my weave deck.<br>
<br><br>
Thanks for reviewing it, and enjoy ! <br>
<br>
NOTE: This deck may be somewhat hard for beginners to play effectively, as good judgement is required for deciding when to play Weave Minds. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
