<br>
O&#39;Qua:<br>
<br>
Standard Play:<br>
<br>
Take the Submerge and Implosion for her starting cards. Draw 3 random cards. <br>
<br>
First s/p/r phase:<br>
Conjure a bubble Xyx. Use Burst to draw 3 cards. <br>
<br>
Play Creatures Step: <br>
Play a Sea Barl of Bubble Xyx if you drew into another one.<br>
<br>
Second s/p/r phase:<br>
Use Lore or Burst on any Barl&#39;s or Xyx&#39;s you might have played.<br>
<br>
End of turn: Draw 2 cards and say go.<br>
Continue to Conjure out Bubble Xyx&#39;s and Sea Barls to fill your hand as fast as possible. You&#39;re searching mostly for the following cards:<br>
River Abaquist, Karak Necklace, and Corathan. <br>
<br>
Suicide O&#39;Qua if you have to in order to proceed with the game.<br>
<br>
vs Core Magi (mainly The Dark Twins/1st turn Corrupt):<br>
Do NOT take the Submerge and Implosion. Draw 5 Random cards. <br>
<br>
First s/p/r phase: Conjure out the Hunter Jile to break Corrupt if needed.<br>
<br>
Play Creatures Step: Play any Barls of Bubble Xyx&#39;s you got off the draw. <br>
<br>
Second s/p/r phase: Use the Hunter Jile, THEN use Lore or Burst if you drew and played any Sea Barls or Bubble Xyxs. This prevents an Abraxin&#39;s Crown from wiping your entire hand. Should they Crown you, you still have the Xyx in play to maybe defend, or have the Sea Barl to use to help restock your hand. <br>
<br>
Continue play as standard from here on out.<br>
<br>
Arosa/Quilla:<br>
<br>
First p/s/r phase:<br>
If they have a decent relic, and you drew the Karak Necklace and Hubdra&#39;s Cube, play the Band, Necklace, and Cube. Take their Relic, add 2 energy to your Magi, and draw 2 cards from the effects on your relics. <br>
<br>
Play creatures step:<br>
Try to play 1 Corathan. Play River Abaquists for 2 energy. Play an Abaquist if you have the Ring of Secrets and several Relics, or if they have a 3 energy or less creature.<br>
<br>
Do not be tempted to play the 2nd Corathan if you drew it, you may need it later.<br>
<br>
Should you not have enough creature to steal all theirs, I suggest playing a Sea Barl, Bubble Xyx, or Abaquist.<br>
<br>
Second p/s/r phase:<br>
Play only enough relics to be able to use the River Abaquist&#39;s power to steal their highest energy creature. Don&#39;t be tempted to dump your hand, you&#39;ll need the extra relics in hand in case they manage to Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
Begin stealing their creatures. <br>
<br>
Every time you steal a creature, you will be also gaining the following if you have the right cards in play:<br>
<br>
Karak Band: 2 energy (pays for the River Abaquists)<br>
Karak Necklace: 2 cards<br>
Corathan: Discard the River Abaquist, steal a creature, then return the River Abaquist to your hand. Warrior&#39;s Boots it out again to steal another creature if you need to.<br>
<br>
If you cannot take control of all of your opponents creatures, use Lore or Burst on the Barl or Xyx you should have played in your play creatures step. Do not add energy to the Abaquist if you intend to Shell Game it to them.<br>
<br>
End of turn:<br>
Shell game if you need. You should draw 2 cards, return a Orothe Card from your Discard pile, and gain 2 energy. <br>
<br>
Use Lore on Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel every time you can to recycle your deck faster. Discard any spare removal spells if you&#39;ve got control, Hunter Jile if they&#39;re playing non-Core, or Abraxin&#39;s Crown if they have no discard.<br>
<br>
Quilla does almost the same thing as Arosa. Grab the Karak Band and Karak Necklace if you can. If you already have a Necklace, the Barqua&#39;s Bubble, Hubdra&#39;s Cube, and Orothean Goggles are all good 2nd Choices.<br>
<br>
General Play Tips:<br>
In case of Cataclysm or Vaporize, you should always have any relics you didnt NEED in order to steal your opponents creatures in hand. Use those relics to power up the River Abaquists to regain control.<br>
<br>
Save a Corathan. If one gets discarded from play, use the other Corathan to return it to your hand the first chance you get. These will also help you reset from a Cataclysm or Vaporize by returning the key relics to your hand to be used again when you steal creatures.<br>
<br>
Always remember to return the River Abaquists to your hand.<br>
<br>
Barqua&#39;s Bubble has a new ruling. You can save 1 creature from an Ormagon, Cataclysm, etc. Always save the Corathan. As I&#39;ve said before, he will help you set back up quickly.<br>
<br>
Use Foresight on the Orothean Goggles every turn. If it&#39;s not a card you immediately need, or a River Abaquist, discard it. It will help you recycle your deck faster.<br>
<br>
Use Implosion as a cheap means to weaken creatures in order to put them in range to be stolen. Discard Sea Barls and Xyx&#39;s first, followed by Subermerge, Storm of Fishes, and <br>
Implosion is also a good way to finish off Magi when you had to steal and couldn&#39;t get through to attack.<br>
<br>
Storm of Fishes regularly, but be careful. Always storm before you begin to steal and draw cards. This will allow you to have a hand should they have an Abraxin&#39;s Crown. <br>
<br>
If you miss fire a Storm of Fishes, and they have threats, return the Storm to your hand when you steal and name the other type of card.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s a list of cards to watch for from certain regions that can slow you down or hinder you some:<br>
<br>
Paradywn: Spell Pulse<br>
Core: Vaporize<br>
Arderial: Cataclysm<br>
Orothe: Storm of Fishes<br>
<br>
Always try to Storm before they reveal a fresh Magi if possible. Keep them from resetting your side of the board.<br>
<br>
When you have control of the board, dont be afraid to use the removal spells for quick Magi Death. This helps prevents draws in tournaments, and often comes as a surprise to my opponents for some reason.<br>
<br>
Use the Ring of Secrets to pump up an Abaquist if you need to. Submerge can also push him high enough to take almost any creature.<br>
<br>
vs Core/Dark Twins:<br>
O&#39;Qua tends to be defeated quickly vs the Dark Twins. Use Shell Game as much as possible to stall and draw into what you need. Use Corathan to recycle and play the Hunter Jile every turn until you have control. This will slow them down tremendously. This is done by having a Corathan in play and using Shell Game at the end of every turn, giving them a 1 energy creature, and taking their biggest threat. This sets off the Corathan, allowing you to return the Jile to your hand to be played and used next turn.<br>
<br>
Comments:<br>
<br>
I took this deck to the Decktech Invitational this weekend in Atlanta Georgia at the War Room. Dr. Bob and I both played this deck, with 1 card differences. I preffered the Implosion and preffered a Hubra&#39;s Spear. Both are excellent choices, but I like the versatility and low cost of the Implosion.<br>
<br>
We both went undefeated in the swiss rounds. We intentionally drew in the 5th round. We placed 1st and 2nd, with no losses, and no opponents seeing Quilla. <br>
<br>
This deck takes some practice, but it is a monster when mastered. It has a lot of tricks to overcome any situation, and stong defenses against any of its weaknesses. Check my tournament reports for some info on how I played it against the different regions I encountered. <br>

Notes: This deck is being MRP&#39;d atm, so don&#39;t expect it to be nearly as strong as it was. <br>
To those of you who say Spell Pulse, Vaporize, and Caty stop this deck. You are welcome to continue believing that, and I hope to play you in a tournament soon. You are very very incorrect on that assumption, ask anyone that played against Bob or I playing the deck.<br>
As for everyone that says Chur beats me, well, I am undecided on that. Keep in mind the Chur is a terrible Magi, and anyone that uses that Magi is more than likely going to lose to everyone else. This deck will probably win. Who do you think will be in the finals? ;p<br>
