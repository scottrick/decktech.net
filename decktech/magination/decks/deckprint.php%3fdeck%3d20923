  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The goal is to have a hand full of Furoks, a Robe of Vines, and at least one Fird Stone for when you get to Sperri. The other two Magi will help delay the game for you until you&#39;re ready (and possibly even win in the process).<br>
<br>
TRYN<br>
<br>
Tryn makes a solid starter because of her Power, Refresh. One of the things you learn throughout playing the game is that, early on, unless you start with a Magi like Sorreah that can hand you two Shockwaves or similar Creature destruction, the most effective means of Creature destruction probably available to you is combat. Because of this, Magi that give their Creatures energy boosts are perfect starters (though this can be indirect; Zannah, though she prevents energy loss, is one of the most effective starters in the game, because she will almost always give you at least a two energy benefit, if not more, by preventing at least one energy lost on your Creature and discarding at least one from the opposing Creature). <br>
<br>
Of course, Zannah&#39;s very rare (I don&#39;t even have one of her yet), and two more energy in play for free every turn is a decidedly easier to understand benefit for a beginning player. Tryn also beats out Pruitt in this case because she is much more efficient as far as energy gain is concerned; two for free as opposed to one for free. Pruitt&#39;s Robes makes Pruitt more powerful as a Magi, but again, it is difficult to know when you should and shouldn&#39;t energize a Creature instead of a Magi when you&#39;re new to the game.<br>
<br>
Another benefit of Tryn over Pruitt is her starting Creature, Rudwot, as opposed to Pruitt&#39;s, Carillion and Vinoc. One more Creature makes little difference with twenty-two more in the deck to draw from (sans the Rudwot), and while the Carillion only prevents damage to itself when facing a smaller Creature, the Rudwot actually gains energy, which is generally much better. And as for Vinoc...He is a late-game Creature. Early on, you won&#39;t have anything you should be able to discard to it.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s an average starting turn with Tryn:<br>
<br>
Take Rudwot and Grow, draw three. Play Rudwot and Plith, cast Grow for +3 (average) to Plith, then Refresh Rudwot to five. End turn and you have a formidable force on your side for little investment.<br>
<br>
Just remember when using Refresh, or any other energy gain, you&#39;re not trying to make a Creature huge to have a big Creature. You want to end your turn with your energy as evenly distributed as possible; otherwise you just have everything sunk into one huge &#39;bullseye&#39;, asking for a Shockwave. Consider the opening turn I mentioned above, but Refreshing the Plith instead of Rudwot; the opponent reveals Aula and plays Shockwave on the Plith, spending five to discard seven from your side, just negating what you had benefitted from with Tryn. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don&#39;t put all of your eggs into one basket&quot;.<br>
<br>
ZAJAN<br>
<br>
There are two reasons why Zajan is a good Magi for beginners.<br>
<br>
First, he gives you more options on his initial turn. Those two cards can totally change what you had intended to do, and generally for the better.<br>
<br>
Secondly, he does not allow you to over-commit. By energizing at the end of his turn, though somewhat limiting your options earlier, he makes certain one Ormagon doesn&#39;t ruin your day.<br>
<br>
As a side benefit, he is good against discard decks. Since they abuse the whole mechanic of you drawing cards at the end of your turn regularly, without being able to use them until your next turn, Zajan turns that around.<br>
<br>
SPERRI<br>
<br>
The heart of the deck...You&#39;ve put up a good fight so far, and probably even have the opponent reeling if they haven&#39;t been able to keep up with the aggression, but it is nothing compared to what you&#39;ll be doing now.<br>
<br>
Sperri is one of the ultimate finishing Magi; with the right cards, provided to her because you&#39;ve been smart and held onto them, she can become unstoppable. I have had some matches against aggressive decks that have gotten me to Sperri and they still be on their starter, but she still turned the game and won it. <br>
<br>
You should have a Robe of Vines, hopefully, and a Fird Stone at least..She doesn&#39;t have a lot of energy to use on her initial turn but she can do well with what she&#39;s got. Spend twelve energy and, because of Infuse and the Robe, she&#39;ll have twenty-one energy in play. And those Furoks are quite deceptive...Hitting a fresh, six to seven energy one with a Shockwave actually constitutes a loss, because you only paid four energy for it. <br>
<br>
And if that isn&#39;t all, when the opponent finally manages to get one in the discard pile, you just bring it back next turn with Preserve, and you still lose nothing, because it will have at least six energy when you play it, which is what you paid. Combine this with the fact that the opponent has to defeat them on their turn or you&#39;ll suffer even less of a loss because of Retrieve giving energy back to you, and you&#39;re in fairly definite control of the board.<br>
<br>
Until they start throwing Thunderquakes and other removal at you. Even when I began, I had one Quake, and it went in every deck (Core didn&#39;t exist then), and a well-timed Quake can clear your side of the board and leave the opposing forces ready to strike. That&#39;s where Fird Stone comes in. Devastate, Thunderquake, Shockwave, Fird Favor stops it all, for only two energy a shot. As long as you keep at least two energy on Sperri, the opponent can&#39;t hit you with anything massively destructive, because you can stop it and ruin everything they put into it.<br>
<br>
OTHER NOTES<br>
<br>
PLITH<br>
<br>
Pliths are used primarily for defense and stalling; don&#39;t attack with them unless they will survive the fight. Also, whenever you can, give them energy, as long as you&#39;re not violating the rule of putting too much in one place. You want them to survive as long as possible and put more cards into your hand.<br>
<br>
JIP<br>
<br>
Jipscan be a little tricky to use...Sometimes you want to get greedy and hold out for something large, but remember any free energy is an advantage. While it&#39;s nice to wait for the opponent to play a Grow or Shadow Bones, just be careful; if the opponent can obviously defeat the Jip with the energy they already have in play without taking a significant loss, then they have no need for a large energy boost, so get what you can. If you are in control of the game, however, a Jip can serve to hold the opponent at bay; they need to give themselves an energy advantage to survive, but if they try it, you&#39;ll just get the same advantage right back, and they&#39;ll have used resources for nothing. As long as you&#39;re cautious and aware of how the game is going, then Jip will be very frustrating for the opponent to face.<br>
<br>
STAGADAN<br>
<br>
This is a Creature you should focus on keeping around; it makes the opponent commit the energy on their Magi to cards in play instead of conserving it for something big. If they try to conserve energy, you just go right over and take it away. Another one of the Creatures that gives Naroom the reputation of being &quot;the broken region&quot;.<br>
<br>
FOREST JILE<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t be afraid to play it and use its Power if you have two or more Creatures that have attacked-especially if you have Tryn out-because you&#39;ll gain a two energy advantage. Even if that&#39;s not the case &quot;transferring&quot; two energy from the Jile to one other, more useful or very weak Creature will help insure that you keep your resources spread out. And if you&#39;re in a case where there are no defenders, attack conservatively; attack with the smallest Creatures available, hopefully including the Jile last, so that you gain the most benefit from its Power. Remember, the Jile gets the two energy back as well if it attacked, as long as it doesn&#39;t spend all of its remaining energy using the Power, and so you can inflate your other Creatures for no loss at all.<br>
<br>
The rest of the cards in the deck should be fairly self-explanatory, though I do offer one other piece of advice; absolutely DO NOT play a Furok unless you can guarantee you will have at least two for Sperri (I still say three is best). If there&#39;s none in the hand and one in the discard pile, guess what? You&#39;ve probably just lost, because Sperri will take that one and her biggest advantages will be all but negated. If you get one in the discard pile, you had better have another in hand or a second alongside the first in the discard pile so that you can pull one and Preserve the other on her first turn. Though, by all means, if you have three early on, go ahead and play one, but no more; you will get it back when Sperri is revealed. Just be extra wary against Orothe; if they know you&#39;re playing Sperri third they will try to Undertow your Furoks, which puts them back into your deck, and that actually is a bad thing with Sperri, since she cannot get them back easily.<br>
