Ya play creatures, then ya hit your oppponent upside the head with them. Well, maybe a little more startegy than that.....<br>
<br>
I always start with Baa, just because of his ability to load me up with cards for the rest of the game. Frequently Baa can take down their first magi, which just makes it easier for Blygt. Blygt is the real MVP of this deck. The sheer swarm he generates is usually enough to go unscathed versus the entire opposing magi stack after a good setup from Baa. Lastly, of course, is Golthub. By now, you should have drawn through your deck at least once, which means you&#39;re holding on to that single Maelstrom. So, the second Golthub pops up, drop the maelstrom and use Golthub&#39;s &#39;Mire&#39; ability to make the game a tie. After all, if you&#39;re already at Golthub, and they aren&#39;t at their third magi, then ya aren&#39;t gonna win anyways.<br>
<br>
Point of note: try to keep a Treepsh in play at all times.....I keep having bad experiences with people surprising me with Flame Geyser. And, of course, Treepsh stops people from getting the benefits of their crushing spells.<br>
<br>
Now, before you get uppity with me for using Golthub third and Blygt last, let me remind you how easy it is for you to simply re-arrange the order of your magi. It is rather effective to play Golthub in the number two slot and nuke everything immediately, then jump to Blygt. Should you go this route, add one or two Maelstroms, otherwise you&#39;ll have a hard time drawing one before you get to Golthub. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
