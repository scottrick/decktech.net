TOTAL : 45 Cards    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I finally got around to trading for a Kesia, so I stepped back and looked at the deck to see what use I could get out of the cards with her in it instead of Zaya. Even though her energy isn&#39;t the best compared to Zaya, her energy manipulation abilities are potent. This is the most current version; it has been used in one tournament, where it performed with a 6-0 record. <br />
<br />
<b>GIA</b> <br />
<br />
The goal with Gia in this deck is pure aggression; on average, her first and second turn will consist of the following: <br />
<br />
Turn 1 <br />
<br />
P/S/R 1: Play Weave Powder, pay 1 and discard it to Unearth a Junjertrug Horn. Use Summon to search deck for a Junjertrug. <br />
<br />
Play Creatures: Spend nine energy to play Junjertrug and Bungaloo. <br />
<br />
P/S/R 2: Nothing. Draw two and end turn. <br />
<br />
Turn 2 <br />
<br />
P/S/R 1: Summon another Junjertrug. Play Book oes; uses Lore if necessary. Pay 1 to discard the Book to Unearth a Warrior&#39;s Boots and use Warpath to play the second Junjertrug. <br />
<br />
And then you would play out the turn, and subsequently the game, as strategically as possible. You probably will not need to Unearth much else; if your Junjertrug Horn gets discarded, there&#39;s no great need to get the other one. <br />
<br />
<b>BO&#39;AHSA</b><br />
<br />
Bo&#39;Ahsa switches the pace of the game and can be the most time consuming matchup for the opponent; she can also be an exercise in slight rules-lawyering to your advantage if the need arises. Your goal with her is to always give yourself an advantage on defense by manipulating her Creatures&#39; energy with insightful planning (supreme tactics). An average attack against her may be something like this: <br />
<br />
Bo&#39;Ahsa has a 2E Speag, 3E Quallon, and a 4E Pody in play. The opponent attacks the Speag with an 8E Furok. Speag gains 2E per its Effect then uses Weave combined with Quallon&#39;s Rapid Change to transfer 2E to Pody. Bo&#39;Ahsa then uses Weave Tactics to make Pody the defender instead of Speag. Because of the change in defenders, any Effects involving the new defender being attacked that haven&#39;t been processed yet for that Creature can be used; Speag gains two more energy and Pody&#39;s Weave is activated plus Rapid Change is used to transfer 2E from Speag to Pody. The end result is an 8E Pody vs. a previously unstoppable 8E Furok. <br />
<br />
That example is more of a &#39;worst case&#39; situation, you should have more options in play on defense, generally speaking. Lascinth, Grass Hyren, and against Core, Flugg, can be devastating in her hands. <br />
<br />
<b>KESIA</b> <br />
<br />
Kesia&#39;s key is in her energy manipulating ability. If her effect to just add energy for Weaving wasn&#39;t enough, her Flute makes her almost broken, if she can keep it around. Even just using it for one turn is a huge advantage; play a few Creatures, transfer one energy from half of them to Kesia for 1, then add 2 energy to each of your other Creatures in play...She really takes the least explanation to play, she&#39;s just good. If you happen to still have Thunderquakes in hand, then you can Lockdown Native Strength to play it, if her energy manipulation ability isn&#39;t enough to give you the advantage. <br />
<br />
<b>Special Considerations</b> <br />
<br />
<i>Vs. Sorreah</i> <br />
<br />
You really don&#39;t have much to fear from Sorreah; with Gia, being unable to Unearth slows you down, but you should at least be able to get a Junjertrug Horn with Weave Powder your second turn, then proceed from there. If you know you&#39;re facing Sorreah first, you probably will want to skip the Book oes in the hopes of drawing something useful. Bo&#39;Ahsa will be the one most hurt by Sorreah; you have more energy than him, so you can win through sheer brute force, and Weave Tactics only makes her energy manipulation and defense more abusive, but it&#39;s not a necessity. With Kesia, you still have her Flute, which is where she gets the most abuse from, and look at it this way; you can play your Thunderquakes now. <br />
<br />
<i>Vs. Discard</i> <br />
<br />
You may want to try working in Uwamar Beads to Unearth with Gia. Junjertrug Horn is also another card to try and keep out as much as possible to keep you in Creatures; if they can&#39;t deal with the Horn, they&#39;ll eventually run out of means to stop the Junjertrugs, and you should have energy to spare, since most discard decks require stalling to prepare before finishing a magi. <br />
<br />
<i>Vs. Core</i> <br />
<br />
Nothing really special here, except that you should definitely save Flugg for Bo&#39;Ahsa; any player with his wits about him will attack Flug directly-that should be your opportunity to Weave as much energy to it as you can, Weave Tactics a new Creature into the fray (giving it +4E in the process), and potentially Weave more to Flugg, trying to keep it able to survive Creature combat as long as you can. <br />
<br />
<i>Using Aritex</i> <br />
<br />
A lot of people badmouth Aritex, but I have never seen anything but a look of distress on my opponent after using it. The key is what you use it with-you want to sacrifice the smallest Creature possible to it, one that doesn&#39;t have a very versatile ability, or that is too small to be effective any longer; using Weave to pull energy off in the Attack Step to make the Creature as small as possible can do the job. This is also the best thing to use for those Tweaves you happen to have gotten outside of your Draw Step. I would recommend not using Aritex, however, if you have more than one or two energy on your Magi; you should have been able to spend it on something, and there&#39;s no reason not to. The best time to use Aritex overall has been when you reveal a new Magi against an opposing one who is barely standing, as then you can mount a fairly solid defense and then refresh your Magi, effectively giving you two as your next turn will be just as good as having a new Magi, resource-wise. <br />
<br />
<i>Using Harmony</i> <br />
<br />
Harmony is a beautiful little equalizer; most people look at its effect on all Creatures in play and dismiss it, but that&#39;s the point..In play. Flip a fresh Magi, Harmony, then play your defenses against a group of crippled forces. Combine with Jumbor and Lascinth or Grass Hyren to wipe the board clean. <br />
<br />
<b>Held Cards</b> <br />
<br />
And, finally, these are cards you should try to hold for the appropriate Magi (Gia is listed in the slight chance she isn&#39;t first). This listing does not count starting cards: <br />
<br />
<b>GIA</b> - Any Relic that isn&#39;t immediately useful, with the exception of Weave Powder. <br />
<br />
<b>BO&#39;AHSA</b> - Quallon, Grass Hyren or Lascinth, Jumbor, and Flugg (vs. Core). <br />
<br />
<b>KESIA</b> - Harmony, Lascinth, and Rayje&#39;s Belt. <br />
<br />
Final Note: The deck does look a bit card-heavy, but with the combination of Unearth and Weave Powder, as well as all of the starting cards each Magi receives, the deck will be thinned appropriately. And, yes, Gia&#39;s Tome is intentionally not in here, Gia needs to draw instead of taking it to begin with, and there are enough Creatures the other Magi would not need it as well. <br />
