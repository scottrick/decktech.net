Total 40 card deck with 3 magi.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay this is how the deck works. first magi is Tiller. he is your card drawing engine. all of his starting help you draw cards. he is 80 % of the time not supposed to go offensive. all he is used for id drawing cards.<br />
<br />
Next up is Yaki. heres where you go on the offensive. yaki starts with his gauntlets very helpful thats the strategy of this deck attack attack attack. you play as many creatures as you can boot them in to play whatever.there is shokewaves and thunderquakes in there to help you clean up a bit if need be. balamants, stagadans and wasprine stalkers help slow your opponents energy flow. then you can pick away at there creatures with you triple striking team.don&#39;t be afraid to use your wasprines thats what they are there for.<br />
<br />
Woot! woot is extremely good for this deck. hopefully you will have the second gauntlets by now and you pull all the wasprines back to your hand. woot is good for finishing what yaki started. also he can get around the oh so peskey burrow.<br />
<br />
Some of the cards in this deck are hard to get. mainly Belt and Tombs. tombs is only in there for those tight pinchs and belt is there for soreah or something that locks down yaki. the belts are replacible with sandswirls not the greatest replacement but it works. if you need a boost of energy and still have weebos and weeblits in your hand that you didn&#39;t filter with tiller try throwing in channelers gloves to ditch em for energy instead. relic stalkers also might be a great healp.<br />
<br />
Well there it is hope you have fun with it i did. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
