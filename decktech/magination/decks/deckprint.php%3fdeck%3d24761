This deck is another one of those &quot;set-up for Obgren&quot; combo decks, and uses O&#39;Qua and Shaper&#39;s Apprentice as a super-card-drawing duo. <br>
<br>
O&#39;Qua: The strategy here is quite simple. Draw cards. You conjure Bubble Xyx&#39;s, and let her die. Don&#39;t worry about defense. As long as you have around 10-15 cards in your hand before she dies, you should be fine 9 times out of 10. And whatever you do, DO NOT waste a Warrior&#39;s Boots or Deep Wellisk here or with Shaper&#39;s Apprentice. You&#39;ll need them for later. <br>
<br>
Shaper&#39;s Apprentice: Sure he can bring back a Giant Parathin that O&#39;Qua used, but he can also bring back a Bubble Xyx that O&#39;Qua uses! Simply play the Sea Barl that Shaper starts with, and another Bubble Xyx if you have it. Use both, then use Dream Twist to discard the Sea Barl and bring back the used Bubble Xyx. Don&#39;t worry about Shaper not lasting long, he&#39;s not supposed to. If both O&#39;Qua and Shaper last 2 turns each, or a total of 4 turns, you should be GOLDEN. <br>
<br>
Obgren: The meat of the deck. Here&#39;s where all the action on YOUR part takes place. You should have in your hand at least 2 of the following: Creeping Chill, Bog Stench, Deep Wellisk, and Warrior&#39;s Boots. First, you want to play the Staff of Keepers and name Orothe. Then play the Robes of the Ages. Then, if you have it, use Flood of Energy. You&#39;ll need that extra 4 energy to make your first turn with Obgren an optimal one. Don&#39;t worry about them getting energy. It ain&#39;t gonna matter. After that, Warrior&#39;s Boots out 2 Deep Wellisks. Play as many Creeping Chills and Bog Stenches as you have. Change the Bograth on Bog Stench to Kybar&#39;s Teeth with Obgren. Do the same with the Creeping Chills IF (and this is a BIG if) you drew a Cleansing. If not, change Bograth to Orothe. If you drew a Cleansing, use it to Cleanse Deep Wellisk into a KT creature, BUT only if you have the following cards in your hand: Entangle, and Will of Orothe; making the DW&#39;s KT does not allow them to be protected by Shell, thus you must be able to prevent them from casting spells long enough to throw out Phrups; if you can&#39;t, or they have enough energy to throw an army back out again, leave the DW Orothe, for more protection. Cleanse the DW AFTER you have played the Deep Wellisks, and only if the above requirements are met because you don&#39;t want to have to pay regional penalties for the Deep Wellisks OR for the rest of your creatures. Then, you quite simply, ATTACK!! Your Deep Wellisks will gain up to 72 energy for each attack, depending on how many Bog Stenches and Creeping Chills you played. If facing more than 2-3 creatures, you probably will only want to play 2 each, and here&#39;s why. Doing so will allow you to cast 2 key cards. Entangle to prevent them from using garbage like Storm Cloud and Vim and Vigor and Equilibrate. If the Deep Wellisks are Kybar&#39;s Teeth, they will gain the 36-72 energy every time they are ATTACKED, as well as when they attack. If you can, use Will of Orothe here to MAKE them attack the Deep Wellisk, clearing their board AND gaining you massive energy. If the opponent has a swarm out, well, it&#39;s gonna get ugly. After you have gone through your Creeping Chills and Bog Stenches, simply keep attacking, and start creating a lock with Phrups and Wellisks. You only need to protect your Deep Wellisks for a few turns while you set up, and you&#39;ve got it made. You should be cycling your deck every couple of turns by now, so keeping up the supply of Phrups and Wellisks should not be a problem. <br>
<br>
Potential Problems <br>
Energy Drainers such as Storm Clud, V&V, etc.: This is why having the Shells and entangles played early with Obgren is so key. The Deep Wellisks must be untouchable while you&#39;re setting up the lock of Phrups and Wellisks. <br>
<br>
Large Deep Wellisk going into Obgren: I have added in a Storm Cloud in case of this happening.  In the event of other DW&#39;s in play, simply Thunderquake them down to 1.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m really interested in feedback on this deck, either through ratings or d-mail. I put my decks in the Advanced section for a reason. I expect only the best from my decks, so therefore i want them judged by the highest standard. Please consider accordingly. Thank you.  <br>
