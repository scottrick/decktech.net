TOTAL: 40 Cards  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">GREJ:<br>
<br>
Grej is a good starter for this deck because her Power allows her early Creatures (except Granite and Crystal Parmalags) to tough things out in a fight more; she makes an especially useful setup magi if she draws a Pylofuf, as you process Burrow first then Invulnerability. The first attack that turn will try to remove two energy at most, then Invulnerability will prevent one; the rest of the attacks can only assign one, which would then be prevented by Invulnerability.<br>
<br>
PREK:<br>
<br>
Prek&#39;s starting cards and ability to play cards from both regions freely are her strengths. She could also make use of fighting with a group of Granites, since they each increase the Invulnerability of the others (if you had all three in play, for instance, each one would lose four less energy in attacks). Otherwise, there&#39;s no specific strategy for her, just play well enough to try and bring them at least to their third magi. <br>
<br>
RADGET:<br>
<br>
Radget is the final stand for the deck; you should have a hand full of Parmalags and plenty of options. Of course, you should have been holding the Staffs of Keepers for her, so she can now play the Kybar&#39;s Teeth Creatures with no problem (there shouldn&#39;t be enough opposing removal left to get rid of them, and they&#39;ll probably save it for more important Relics anyway), and Crystal Parmalags are strong with her, since nothing short of a Cataclysm will take them out, and it&#39;d take a heavy hitter to take down a ten energy Creature that grows for three every turn; just remember, you can plan on the defensive Granite Parmalag strategy, or the offensive Crystal, but they don&#39;t work hand in hand, since Crystals gain no benefit from the Granites (because Crystal Parmalag can&#39;t have energy removal prevented by the Granite&#39;s second Effect). Also, if you can manage to get two or three Granites into play with any Magi, you just may want to; the prevention of three to four energy per combat with such a large Creature is too good to pass up.<br>
<br>
Special Considerations:<br>
<br>
For a beginner deck, there&#39;s really not much planning that needs to go into this; this deck should help you get used to playing around with the cards and still be competitive enough to put up a fight. Still, the Climbing Staffs are in there mostly for fighting Sorreah; you can discard Climbing Staff to stop Sorreah&#39;s Effect - Suppress, because it affects only your Magi. If you do, Suppress cannot be used by the opponent for the entire game.<br>
<br>
One other thing, there are some cards that should be held for the appropriate Magi. (Grej is listed in the chance she isn&#39;t first; there are cases when switching her for Radget can be more beneficial, such as against quick <br>
offense decks). This listing does not count starting cards:<br>
<br>
GREJ - Pylofuf.<br>
PREK - Granite Parmalags.<br>
RADGET - Staff of Keepers, Crystal or Granite Parmalags.<br>
