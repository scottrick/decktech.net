Don&#39;t fill your hand with useless relics that you have two of or spells that a pointless or two expensive. Bograth creatures a good enough without spells or relics to slow them down. With plain creatures you always know your going to draw a creature no matter what.<br>

Moob is a great creature because hey your only playing creatures so the more you play the more fun it gets and the more moobs out the more fun counting creatures gets. Ainjer same as moob but does creature damage but he has to live till the next turn but this little monkey freak is lethal. treepsh because cald fire bad and orothe water salty. multiple creature damage is deadly to this deck and he&#39;ll watch for it. it is annoying to have to clean up about 25 creatures with a lot of ones on them. ruid engergize. zungg eat. bolobog makes big friendly ceature. swamp weebo says good bye. Mirago more power to you and you&#39;ll have plenty of cards in your hand. then ooze arboll to add to your creatures fun muck vinoc to get the big meanies. Moss quido for more creature friends to play with. n&#39;kala is handy dandy to your magi. Jile is EVIL and so is poison baloo root. Makoor if your going to die soon any way. and all the hyren: swamp means cheap creatures, fog means more cards and a variable creature, and mist because your going to play it for free soon and maybe three at the same time and because your going to discard the cards with mirago to have three free beefy 17 creatures out in play and that makes your opponent scoop because they can&#39;t really fight all of that.<br>

Baa is there to draw cards. Emlob is the evil and insane one because he has three little friends i call me myself and I to add to your creature total and brog because your creatures are going to die in combat why not just 1 energy (or in some cases all of the energy you used to play that little 1 energy creature) back for each creature that dies in combat. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
