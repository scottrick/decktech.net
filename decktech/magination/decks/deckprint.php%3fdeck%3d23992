&quot;Pure Madness&quot;<br>
By Haris Kopic<br>
Original idea by Nick Dowd   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, before I start typing my lengty and extensive strategy, I would like to point out that decks need strategies. This goes out to the newer members here, who don&#39;t even bother to type one up or just fill the section with irrelevant crap.<br>
<br>
To start off, I will go through each of the invididual magi in order.<br>
<br>
Baa:<br>
Baa is in the deck for one sole purpose. And that is to draw cards. It doesnt really matter if Baa stays alive for 2 or 20 turns, as long as she has either a few Moob, or a Maelstrom or both. With her, try to play the cheaper creatures so that you are able to draw more cards more often. Rayje&#39;s Shield with Baa is a wicked combo, and it will take you a long way towards keeping her alive longer. Don&#39;t go all out with her though, save at least 10-15 creatures in your hand so that you are ready to take off when Blygt hits the board.<br>
<br>
Golthub:<br>
To start out, I want to apologize for using a so-called &quot;Crutch Magi&quot;. However, I have to use him. There is no other magi that I have tried that works as well as he does. With a Maelstrom in hand, he will be able to knock out one magi 99.9% of the time. When he flips, make sure to grab his starting card of one Moob, they will be essential when we reach Blygt. Now, back to the Crutch Magi problem. I have tried almost all Bograth magi available in the middle, but I have found out that Golthub works the best. If you are playing someone else, you will need to play creatures to defend that magi, which takes away from the awesome power Blygt will have once he enters the game. Golthub does not play any creatures, or anything at all for that matter, besides the Maelstrom. First, you Mealstrom the opponent&#39;s energy away, and then you just use his power Mire on whatever region the opponent is playing. Simple.<br>
<br>
Blygt:<br>
Blygt is a powerhouse. Plain and simple. I&#39;ve taken out 2 magi with him more often then not, and he has the power to take out the entire opposing magi stack if neccassary. With him, play all your creatures and relics in hand until you have 3 energy left on him. Make sure to play all 3 Moob, they are an essential part of his game.  Once you have set up your creature base, use Moob&#39;s retrieve to gain dozens of energy to fill Blygt&#39;s energy base right back up to his starting and above. Then, still during your power/relic/spells step, use Blygt&#39;s power, Waking Dreams. With this power, you usually want to go for a Moob, Ooze Arboll, and the 3rd one is up to you. Moob is good for gaining more energy on Blygt, while Ooze Arboll increases the size of your formerly small cratures. The 3rd pick is up to you and very situational, and can be very different in every game you play. If the opponent has big creatures, go for Muck Vinoc. If he has a bunch of smaller ones, go for Zungg etc. This one has almost neverending possibilities. The Moss Pendant and Rayje&#39;s Shield are also very helpful for Blygt, but they are far from being neccassary. You can win a game without having drawn either one, but they will help you out a lot later on in the game when every energy counts. <br>
<br>
Now that I have explained the mag, I will go into explaining individual cards:<br>
<br>
Relic Stalker: Self-Explanatory. Save these for mean relics like Belts and Strag&#39;s Claws.<br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Shield: Fits in perfectly with the card drawing strategy early on in the game. This card is almost broken when combined with Baa. It&#39;s a huge help with any magi you have too. I would love to have 2 of these in each of my decks.<br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm: This card works very well in denying the opponent the card draw he needs to destroy your angry little mob.<br>
<br>
Maelstrom: An essential card for the success of Golthub. This card will help him take out a magi, almost every time. Should you not have drawn it by the time you reach him, don&#39;t worry, Blyt can take care of 3 magi without a sweat.<br>
<br>
Crushing Stench: This is a very cool card to have in your deck. It helps you rid the table of small pesky creatures, which on the other end helps you land successful attacks AND lets you play a creature for free.<br>
<br>
Darkness: This spell is just mean. Even at 7 energy, it&#39;s still a bargain in my opinion. I sacrifice my Green Stuff to take out his Giant Baldar, its just plain sick if you have more creatures in play than the opponent.<br>
<br>
Moss Quido: Card draw en masse. Very nice when combined with Rayje&#39;s Shield.<br>
<br>
Swamp Weebo: It&#39;s a starter for Blygt, and I&#39;ll probably end up switching it for another Slarnath. This is a very hard card to use effectively, but if you do manage to use it to it&#39;s fullest effect, you will wipe the opposing board clean.<br>
<br>
Jile: Very nice if you have lots of small critters out. It gives them an energize, in addition to the energy they gain with Moss Pendant.<br>
<br>
Slarnath: Beautiful card. It&#39;s a starter for Baa, and usually gives her 2 cards and a 2 energy creature for 4 enegy. Count me in. The power is great if you have 4+ creatures in play.<br>
<br>
Ooze Arboll: Very good and useful card too. This is the card you want to get with Blygt in addition to a Moob and a 3d pick of your choice. If you manage to use one of these every turn, you will have a huge advantage early on.<br>
<br>
Green Stuff: One of my fav. card in this deck. It&#39;s very good if played with a Crushing Stench, because the stench puts it into play with 2 energy, and the Green Stuff gives itself an energy when its played. Also cheap card draw with Baa.<br>
<br>
Muck Vinoc: They are Shockwaves waiting to happen. They will make the opponent think twice about playing that Rock Hyren which he wants to use to mutilate your little friends.  If not used to discard, he is a viable attacker anytime.<br>
<br>
Zungg: This card is incredibly useful. With its power Gnaw, you can weaken a creature before you attack it just to make sure that it will stay dead. It helps clear the board of the weak creatures, and helps bring bigger ones down into your range.<br>
<br>
Moob: Need I say more? This card is just amazingly powerful when combined with Blygt&#39;s effect, and can help you keep a constant energy supply on any magi.<br>
<br>
Bolobog: Helps you strengthen one of your seemingly small and weak creatuers. Just wait until you can overrun the opponent with a 17 energy green stuff....its priceless.<br>
<br>
Possible Issues:<br>
<br>
Vs. Harror: This one is not even a worry usually. Not even a Harror with Cataclysm, Spellfire and a Dark Ayebaw can usually gather enough energy to take out Blygt later on. This one is usually not an issue at all.<br>
<br>
Vs. Burrow: This could be tough. Prepare for a long game. Your match winners here will be the Muck Vinocs and Darkness. They can help you clear those huge Pylofuf roadblocls.<br>
<br>
Vs. Mirror Match: This one will largely depend on luck. It will all come down to whoever can draw his vital cards first and whoever cain gain more energy quicker.<br>
<br>
Vs. Akido: I have not played against Akido with this deck as of yet, but I am sure that I can beat it if I draw the right cards quickly enough. Yea, the opponent can steal one or 2 of your creatures every turn, but you can bring as many or even more than that into play, so you should eventually be able to overpower him. However, this just theoretical, I have not played against Akido and can&#39;t confirm that it will go smoothly.<br>
<br>
<br>
That&#39;s it. I have posted this deck because, as much as I hate to say it, there is a shortage of quality decks on decktech, and I hope to raise this standard to a higher level.  <br>
This deck has a very impressive win-loss ratio. I do not remember the exact amount of wins and losses, but this deck has hardly ever lost to any deck that I&#39;ve played against. (Up yours Tim, Sean, and Rich. You know who you are!).<br>
I hope you have enjoyed reading my strategy, because it is quite long and it can be hard sometimes to put strategy into written words when its this complicated.<br>
<br>
By the way Tim, I will OWN your underneath deck with this one my friend. You will see soon enough. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
