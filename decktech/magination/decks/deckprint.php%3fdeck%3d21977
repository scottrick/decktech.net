This is one mean magi. She has descent starting energy, a normal energize, and can crash, smash, and utterly base the opponent into submission. When you start with her, pull the Scroll of Fire if you have it and save it. Don&#39;t play it until you get to Valkan, who will make the most use of it. Vorga is a creature magi. Use the creatures she draws to nuke the opponent. The best things to do on a turn with Vorga is to attack something or use a power on something, bringing it into the range of destruction, which is to say, so the creature can be discarded by Vorga&#39;s smash. Every spell you draw with Vorga can not help her too much, but would benefit so much greater for your next magi, so save your spells for Valkan. If you get two, play a Water of Life also, if you only draw one with Vorga, save it for Valkan because he needs the extra energy. <br>
<br>
Valkan: <br>
Valkan is a fiery little midgit from the land of flame. With him, the ideal things to get out would be a Scroll of Fire, Water of Life, and at least 1 Giant Arboll in play. When you cast your spells, the Giant Arboll gains 1 energy. Each spell you cast that removes energy from one of your opponents creatures in play. This way, a Thermal Blast for which your roll a 6, would remove 8 from a creature. Your Lava Flows still remove only 2 energy, but your Fire Balls and Firefly Swarm will remove 4 from each creature they hit. Try to keep a couple of creatures in your hand for yout next Magi Gar. <br>
<br>
Gar: <br>
When Gar comes up, you need to be agressive and play a lot of creatures. Once you get the ranks of Dream Creautures in play, attack with them so you get to add energy to them at the end of the turn. Gar is the Caldrean Healer, so you should probably try to amass an army of Creatures including at least one Eargar to totally sap your opponents energy away, then heal the lowest creature at the end of the turn. <br>
<br>
This deck is simple enough to play and there are not any combos really, just destroy the opponent with your Creatures (Vorga and Gar) and your Spells (Valkan). <br>
<br>
Good Luck and I hope the deck works out for you...  <br>
<br>
WHY THIS DECK ROCKS: (A section a review told me to add in).<br>
*This deck is a Direct Damage deck, and it works very well. Direct Damage is a deck type that is basically a type of deck that will smash, bash, crash, and well, destroy your opponent with minimal use of energy and a great selection of cards. The idea is to use the creatures, spells, and relics to the Magi&#39;s advantage to toally wipe the floor with the opposition.<br>
*Trading cards for this deck is important. In order to get all the cards for this deck, you will probably have to trade because of the amount of multiple cards in the deck. Worry not though, this deck uses mostly common and uncommon cards, so don&#39;t go trading a Giant Parathin for 3 fireballs, but, do trade away your extras that someone needs (Or a few rares, not all of them) to get cards for this deck if you plan to play it.<br>
*The deck is fast and simple to play. Use your first and last magi as &quot;Creature&quot; magi, which means the brunt of their attack power comes from Dream Creatures. The middle magi, Valakan, was made to cast cald spells. Use all the spells you can get with Valkan and a few creatures so he is not to easily defeated. With Gar though, you can play any cards from the deck to win, but remember to focus on creatures. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
