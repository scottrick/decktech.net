First of all, I&#39;d like to explain my choice for magi.<br>
<br><br>
Evu is there to simply draw as many cards as possible and to set up for the rest of the game. If he can beat a Magi or two, even better. I&#39;ve even won games sitting just on him without even having to cycle to Tryn.<br>
<br><br>
Tryn Flamesaver is in the deck to do some direct damage to the opponent while continuing to beat him down with creatures. Her power is just fun to use, I used to dislike this card, but it&#39;s becoming a very fun card to use.<br>
<br><br>
Eidon is in the back for support. His 6 energize is the primary reason he&#39;s in the back. I usually don&#39;t try to rely on his effect too much, since this is not supposed to be a splooge deck. But if his effect does kick in somewhere along the way, so be it.<br>
<br><br>
Now I&#39;ll explain certain individual cards:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Flame Rudwot: Starting for Tryn F/S and a very fun card to use. He can deal 2 and heal for 3 every turn if you can manage to keep him alive.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Grow: Starting for Tryn and Eidon<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Crushing Roots: I&#39;ve been meaning to take out either the 2 Giant Carrillion or 2 Tap Roots to play 3 of these, because they&#39;re just very useful in almost any situation.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Bottomless Pit: Useful card against swarm and other weenie decks.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Shockwave: Need i say mo&#39; ?<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Beam of Light: Relic and Creature distruction. I usually play 2 Beam and 2 Stalker in all of my decks, but I ran out of stalkers here so I just play 2 Beam and 1 Stalker.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Rayje&#39;s Sword: Useful against many decks. It kills Burrow, Braggle, KT and certain other decks.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Nodj: My top choice against Vellup Swarm Decks, he can take them out turn after turn while growing back to 5E every turn as well. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Giant Carrillion: Additional Destruction. May be taken out to add 2 more Crushing Roots.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Tree Hinko: To quote Sean Cordere: "The Devil&#39;s Spawn". One of the most useful cards in the game in my opinion.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Chaos Plith: Better than Naroom Plith because it lets you draw cards even if it attacks. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Bhatar: I will switch this one for an Alpine Xamf as soon as i get ahold of a foil Naroom one.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Forest Jile: Starting for Eidon, decent power too.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Balamant: Direct damage to the magi, fun to use with boots to take out an oppponent who thinks he&#39;s just out of your reach.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
That&#39;s my humble deck, any suggestions for improvements are welcome.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Thank you for reading it.<br>
<br><br>
By the way: I need a Base set foil Tryn, if anyone owns one, D-Mail me and we can set up a way to arrange a trade.<br>
