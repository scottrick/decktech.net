The Idea of this deck is to get a lot of free energy fast. Arawan is the set-up magi for Ookami, Ookami is the Star of the deck, and Yricho is the Back-up Magi. <br>
<br>
Arawan: The set-up magi for Ookami. Save the Robe of Petals. When comes into play, play a Ghazran for a strong Defence (if you got one play a Mydra instead), then use Warp Driven to get a Lahalou, than draw 2 cards.  After your Opponent goes, Warp Drive a Hardshell Weebo. Attack with Ghazran only if necessary, and if you played a Mydra, don&#8217;t attack at all. Draw 2 Cards. On your next turn, Use Warp Driven and get a Vine Hyren, than Play a Mydra if you happened to draw one earlier. Draw 2 cards. If you have managed to survive from this point, very good, but if you didn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t worry. If he still is alive, warp drive some more H.S. Weebos, Lahalous, or K&#8217;teebs for Ookami.  <br>
<br>
Ookami: After Arawan has set up Ookami, Get his Starting Cards. Play the Robe of Petals and Ookami&#8217;s Drums. Then Play a Vine Hyren and Dreamwarp it up one energy. Than play 2 HS Weebos (3 if you got another one), and 2 Lahalous (3 if you got another one). As you play the 4 creatures (at least), dreamwarp the H.S. Weebos up one so they have 2 energy, and Dreamwarp the Lahalous up one so they get 3. Vine Hyren should have at least 11 energy on it because it gains one energy every time you use dreamwarp. After playing the creatures use grow on so they each Lahalou get 2 energy one each of them so they end up with 5 energy. Use Both HS Weebo&#8217;s Vitalize power on the Other HS Weebo so they end up with 4 energy on each of them. 4+4+5+5+11=29 energy. Ookami had 19 energy on him when he entered play. He Spent a total of 13 energy. 16 extra energy was on my side of the Board, while Ookami still has 6 energy to spend (maby less if you played the extra Weebo and Lahalou). If you happened to draw a Staff of Vines, play that and use Strengthen on every one of your creatures. If you got a Bagala Fangs, &#8220;Ups&#8221; a HS Weebo and use &#8220;Badum&#8221; from the Drums on that Weebo so he gain 2. These are just some of the Possibilities of Ookami. He will most likely win the Game for you.<br>
<br>
Yricho: If your opponent just happened to defeat Ookami, Yricho will be his Back-up. Play his Starting Cards (Mydra and Poison Baloo Root) and other things to make your opponent pay. Use his power on Wither from P. B. Root, or any other good power on your creatures. Keep all of the Blooms and Ambushes for him too.      <br>
<br>
Changes: I took out the Lirial&#8217;s Capes because most of the time my creature&#8217;s energy is above their starting energy and wouldn&#8217;t make much of a difference even if it weren&#8217;t. I took away Lirial and her Bagalas because they didn&#8217;t do much. I added the Vine Hyrens because they rule and they can gain energy fast. Laws Rhythm and Blues Deck inspired some of the strategy for it, just to let you know. There it is my final Untamed Growth until Voices of the storms will come out.    <br>
