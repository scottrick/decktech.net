TOTAL : 40 Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">When I build and play a deck, I allow the cards to work well together and not necessarily alone.  For that reason, I&#39;ll explain how each card should be utilized for maximum efficiency.  Obvious opposing combos are up to the player to spot and prepare for, but I will detail the ones I have faced and how to deal with them.<br>
<br>
Kazm -><br>
An obvious first choice for several reasons, the first and foremost if you get the chance to go first play the Giant Baldar and watch the opponent give you energy for each creature he plays.  Of course it is a prime target for Creature removal, so the best possible starting hand is one in which you draw a Greater Garganor. The first decision to make is what cards to start with.  Most decks lead with Kazm for the Energy bonus, but I lead with him because he is the best Magi with Cleansing as a starting card(and the energy bonus).  So always get the Cleansing first.  As for the Giant Baldar, it depends on who you are up against.  If you didn’t go first, you are better off just getting only the Cleansing and seeing what else you get.  This holds especially true against the Dark Twins who tend to lead with a Corrupt.  In the case of a Corrupt, if Cleansing was already Entombed, just draw 5.  Hopefully you’ll get a Beam of Light or Sagawal and be able to get rid of the Corrupt with minimal cost.  If you got the Cleansing, cleanse Entomb as to avoid further “I Cleanse this, You Entomb that battles.”  Against any other region, always Cleanse the DarkBreed Hyren right away in the event that the opponent is running discard.  Plus, against Core if you start with a Greater Garganor, because of ‘Unearth’ you can Cleanse something twice in the first turn and once every turn after that until the Core player has no cards left to play.  After the start, follow through with a regular Kazm strategy.  Try and keep your Creatures with high energy by playing new big ones and attack the heck out of the little ones so the opponent will have no choice but to trigger Kazm’s ‘Hunter’ with every Creature he plays.  Generally speaking it makes more sense to use the Agrillas to allow the bigger creatures to attack first, and that may be the case, but if you can force the opponent to give you energy by losing your only one energy creature, send it off to its demise.  If you get the Kybar’s Scroll or Crushing Stones, play them early and without worry since you will get them back for no cost upon Kazm’s defeat.  If you have both Rockslide Hyrens in your hand make sure you play one of them for the same reason.<br>
<br>
Kyg’n -><br>
Start by getting all of his Starting cards, a Rockslide Hyren, the Kybar’s Scroll, and the Crushing Stones.  If it looks like this battle is going sour, play to stall and not to win.  Kybar’s Teeth has a little talked about card gaining engine that people overlook.  Your cards cost more to play so you are playing less of them.  By definition you are keeping more cards and options in your hand.  The reverse of this is why Bograth has such strong drawing engines, without them they couldn’t play enough other creatures to put up any kind of reasonable fight. If you leave good cards for Targ’n, he can and has finished off all three Magi by himself when properly prepared.  The two biggest threats to watch out for are Rayje’s Sword and Belt.  Make sure to only use the Beam of Lights if you absolutely have to or it will mean you’ll win early, because Targ’n may need them to remain viable.  If you can leave some creatures at enough energy to not be a threat(one or two energy in most cases), do not defeat them until you are ready and able to defeat the opposing Magi, so that you can take full advantage of your Energizing capabilities.  He should very rarely energize for less than five, and more often than not six or more.  Plus, if the opponent has more Creatures than you, you can abuse the biggest battering ram in the game Kybar’s Fang.<br>
<br>
Targ’n -><br>
Yes, it pains me to not have any of his starting cards available, but every creature in the deck has  Invulnerability except for the Darkbreed Hyren(and Kybar’s Fang if you count it).  If Invulnerability gets locked down 21 of the 40 cards, over 50 percent of the deck, are still enhanced by Targ’n as you Magi.  Generally speaking the Rock Hyren only gets the Targ&#39;n bonus when its own Invulnerability is locked down(special thanks to Kybar Kid for pointing out my oversight in statistical analysis).  With a Climbing Staff in play, if you do not see a Cataclysm coming, you can play without the Hyren’s Call two Rock Hyrens at full cost.  If you saved for this, each Rock Hyren also loses three less energy in each attack.  Like I stated in the opening, this deck does not win by gaining energy.  It wins by losing less energy in every single attack throughout the entire game and Targ’n is merely the Coup de Gras.  He is your last stand, so throw out everything you have and don’t hold anything back.  If for some reason you haven’t used the Dewstone yet, this is what you have been waiting for.<br>
<br>
Rock Hyren -><br>
This guy is the Heart and Soul of the deck.  Not only is he a Hyren but he is the toughest creature in Magi Nation to see print.  Use the Call to bring him in for less energy and pound away.  Attack the opposing smaller  creatures first since in the long run that nets you a higher energy shift.  In other words if you attack his 2 energy creatures before he does something mean since he won’t be attacking you with them.  With this Hyren in play, the opponent is constantly forced to make lose if he does lose if he doesn’t decisions.<br>
<br>
Darkbreed Hyren -><br>
Before Nightmare’s Dawn, I had to rely on Ominous Presence to play this guy and that became too situation.  Core is extremely powerful in my area and I got to the point where I do not even use Hyren in my deck, because I would only be playing them for the opponent to take!  Well with Cleansing as a starting cards that changes dramatically.  Now not only do I not get my Hyren taken, but I can now steal opposing Hyren for myself.  Also, since Cleansing makes this a Kybar’s Teeth Creature, I can now use the Hyren’s Call to get the Darkbreed from my deck for a reduced cost and sneak in the surprise ‘Subvert’.  This especially hurts Paradwyn since the Dreamwarp decks love to use the Tropical Hyren.<br>
<br>
Cliff Hyren -><br>
If you are playing Arderial, get this guy into play as fast as you can.  He’ll protect everyone else from a Cataclysm and if you also have a Sagawal in play, you can redirect it to only him.  Another bonus for the Hyren’s Call.<br>
<br>
Rockslide Hyren -><br>
This guy can work wonders against Burrow decks and Gyrg.  Just make sure to try and attack first so that his energy is as low as possible before you use his power. Obviously try to also maximize the damage.  If he has 3 creatures with 2 energy each and one with 7, attack the 7 energy creature go down to 1 because of Invulnerability, and ‘Crush’ for total domination.  And again, another bonus for the Hyren’s Call.<br>
<br>
Greater Garganor -><br>
One of the best cards ever released.  Play him first with Kazm for extra precaution, and use him to cast Cleanse over and over again.  Against any opponent, since Kyg’n starts with Crushing Stones, feel free to cast that over and over again too.  Also if you need anything else you have played, for the price of discarding whatever you have multiples of or don’t need, you can get it right back.<br>
<br>
Giant Baldar -><br>
This guy is in here for two reasons.  First because Kazm can start him if I am feeling unlucky and want to have a guaranteed 9 energy starting creature.  Secondly, if an opponent has something like one Pylofuf out and is stalling for energy and an Ormagon, this guy brining the Magi down to one energy can be devastating(pun intended).<br>
<br>
Agrilla -><br>
The Agrilla lets creatures attack twice.  Use that power to get rid of your small creatures when you have Kazm, and use it with the Kybar’s Fang and big creatures when you want to cause some serious poundings.<br>
<br>
Elder Yark -><br>
If the opponent has Voda or any other type of creatures with way more energy than their Starting energy, this guy alone can win you the game.  It lets you control where you attacks go because the opponent knows he’ll lose out if he attacks.  It is also a nice replacement effect, so if a Rayje’s Sword does enter play, the Yark can keep your other creatures around until you get a chance to either Beam of Light it or defeat that Magi.<br>
<br>
Vogo & Sagawal -><br>
Both of these are pretty self explanatory.  If the opponent is discarding one of your creatures from play use the Vogo to redirect it to your smallest or most useless creature in play or use the Sagawal to take it for the team.  Another bonus is that each of these guys have Invulnerability.  You really don’t appreciate how good it is until you are getting its benefit from every attack both you and the opponent make.  These guys win you the game when your opponents strategy includes heavy discard.<br>
<br>
Climbing Staff -><br>
Protects both your hand and you Magi along with giving you an energy back from each creature played.  Never discard this for the Greater Garganor unless there is no other choice.  If you have nothing else to do with the Greater Garganor and one of these in you discard pile, always get the extra ones back.  It comes in especially handy with the Hyren’s Call since it still nets you the one energy gain after the Hyren is called.  With one energy on the Magi, after an energize of 5, which is the average in this deck, it allows you to play a good portion of the deck.<br>
<br>
Kybar’s Fang -><br>
It can’t be discarded from play and if you can use it more than once you have more than made back the 8 energy investment from bringing this into play.  If works particularly well with Kyg’n since he doesn’t need any creatures in play to stay in play with zero energy.  If Kyg’n is attacked down to 0, you will energize for however many creatures the opponent has, hopefully use the Scroll to help Targ’n have, more cards, and get a free 14 energy attack for each turn the opponent doesn’t manage to finish him off.  Plus it just looks REALLY cool.<br>
<br>
Dewstone -><br>
Besides the fact it lets your other 2 Magi stay around more like Kyg’n and pays for itself and then sum when you discard it, it also lets you get more energy on your turn.  With this in play you can defeat 2 creatures and then use Sip to get some free energy.  While it is in play it is helping you and when you are about to be defeated it is helping you.  Use it as soon as you draw it and save a Greater Garganor for your next Magi so you can get the Dewstone back on your Magi’s opening turn.  It is because of the Greater Garganors that I only have one copy of the cards which are only useful in certain situations.  A good player should know what to discard and what to get back, because it will change for every game and every situation.<br>
<br>
Kybar’s Scroll -><br>
It is a starting card and extremely useful for getting the cards you need faster than you would usually get them.  It is also important to use a few times just to make sure you have a good hand going if you are going to be forced to use Targ’n.<br>
<br>
Inhibitor Band -><br>
I hate Rayje’s Belt, I love this thing.  Use it to stall out your opponent while you beat him down and stall yourself for the Beam of Lights to take care of the Belt and Sword after the opponent finally gets around to taking care of your Band.<br>
<br>
*Mantle of Shadows -><br>
This is the only card which could actually be considered a sideboard.  Once it gets into your hand you will have no way to get rid of it, so it is dead weight in any game not against Core, and dead weight after you Cleanse Entomb.  If Cleanse gets Entombed first however and the opponent has Darkbreed Hyrens himself(which he will), you need a way out of it and this card is the best/only way to get the upper hand in a Entomb/Cleanse battle.  If you face a Darkbreed Hyren without Cleansing your own, you will lose.  The deck has to many Hyren for any other outcome to be possible, but the way it is designed you will have more than a fighting chance.  Even against the Twins, if they know to Entomb Cleansing right off the bat and play a Darkbreed, you should still be able to survive off of non-Hyren creatures until you get a chance to clean the mess they made.  The Asterisks is by this  because if the Dark Twins are not in your area you should replace this card with a Meta-Game decision as to what your biggest threat will be.<br>
<br>
Beam of Light -><br>
In the worst case situation you may have to Beam of Light your own Inhibitor band to play a Mantle of Shadows, but while playing this deck it has never come to that.  I have however had to use it to get rid of a first turn Corrupt.  Against Bograth it can be used against virtually every card in the opponents deck.  It is versatile and effective.  It can and will win you game when used on the right thing, so save it for when you really need it.<br>
<br>
Crushing Stones -><br>
This spell is the only way this deck has to add energy back onto my creatures.   Frankly if it wasn’t a starting card I would probably find something else to replace it, but with the Greater Garganors I have cast it 4 turns in a row to give my creatures one energy each in each of those turns.  When the Rock Hyrens are gaining energy it really doesn’t matter how fast it happens.  It can be instrumental in knocking out a pesky creature before any attack though and can be used after any energize step, so you are still never sad to see it in you hand.<br>
<br>
Cleansing -><br>
Sure it can screw over Core, but it is here to bring the Darkbreed Hyren away from the Dark Side.  The Darkbreed Hyren is just too valuable of a card to not take advantage of it and this card not only lets me use him, but also takes that use away from the opponent.  Another trick I like to employ is to let the opponent only see the Hyren’s Call, so that he thinks I am running a Yerthe or Naroom deck to that it gets Entombed.  Once it is Entombed I can Cleanse it and cast it at without penalty since it is now Kybar’s Teeth card.  Part of playing a card game is not only figuring out what your opponent is going to do, but making him think you are going to do something else.<br>
<br>
Hyren’s Call -><br>
And finally...  This card works on two levels.  It lets you search your deck for any Hyren and play it without cost.  This gives you a card advantage since you are cycling through your deck at a faster rate than the opponent(you will reshuffle first) and it lets you bring in Hyrens that you may not have had the ability to otherwise.  If you manage to get it Entombed and Cleansed you can bring in a Rock Hyren for 6 and even get an energy back if you have a Climbing Staff in play.  When you are in a tournament and facing different opponents, the ability to get a Rockslide Hyren one time and then a Darkbreed Hyren(since it is now Kybar’s Teeth from the Cleansing) another is priceless.  Hyren’s call was errata’d so Naroom couldn’t call in a Rock Hyren.  The Kybar’s Teeth Magi however still can.<br>
<br>
The only real threat I can foresee is the River Abaquist, Karak Jewelry, Corthan combos, but I have been told that they will be MRP’ed soon.  I have beat a River Abaquist/Corathan deck without any MRPs with my Bograth deck, but I will submit that after I prove it at a Tournament this weekend.  That is another submission altogether, and I agree that the Aikido type deck is Silly overpowered, which is why I did not include strategy against it yet in this submission.<br>
<br>
This is my first deck submission, anywhere, but obviously not my first deck.  I built it to be original, fun, and tournament worthy.  I have tested it enough to know that it is all three.  Build it yourself and surprise your playgroups with a Kybar’s deck that doesn’t revolve around the Ritual Spear or a Hyren deck that isn’t Naroom, Weave, Orothe, or Universal.  If you can’t play it before you rate it, I only ask that you at least read this whole article first.  Just before submitting this I searched the deck archives to check if this deck design had been attempted, while other decks used these Magi, no other Kybar deck I saw was similar to this one.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
