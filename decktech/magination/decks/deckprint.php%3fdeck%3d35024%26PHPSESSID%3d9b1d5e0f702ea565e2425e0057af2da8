<br />
Wence. good ol wence. wence is good for his abilitie to get cards and creatures into your hand. also with a 6 energise he can be a contender. the 10 starting energy hurts a bi so try and go second if all possible. don&#39;t fear going all out with him. make sure you save some cards for wence though. never be afraid to use wasprines with wence. okay on to woot!<br />
<br />
Woot! seeing a pattern here magi that start with &quot;W&quot; well don&#39;t worry about that it will change. woot can pull back a few wasprines to your hand. he is very effective against just about anything with wasprines thats damage can&#39;t be affected.and well weebos are fore wimps as he implies. he should efeat a amgi for you and if not no problem Zannah has backup.<br />
<br />
Zannah. what can i say about zannah short of she is one of the best freaking naroom magi if not the best i have ever seen. not to mention she starts with out beloved baby furok making her the queen of annoyences. she gives you that warm feeling inside when the ardarial magi curses for having to waste a shokewave on it just to kill it. ok enough about the fuzzies on the inside. if she doesn&#39;t do it for you then well you were outmatched outnumberd and out played. doesn&#39;t matter this is just a simple narom weenie with balamants.<br />
<br />
suggestionds for replacement cards. well i don&#39;t have really any replacements but i do like to mention cards that could be possiple replacements for the not so card gifted player seeing how i was one of them.instead of belts you can put in more kill. or sandswirl works magic also. as for zannah yes she is very very very hard to come into contact much less owning. a sutible but not as wonderful replacement could be salafy. eidon is a good choice also. as for baby furoks good luck. well that about sums it up. have fun. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
