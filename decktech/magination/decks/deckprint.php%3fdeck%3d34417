Once again, it is Restricted Deck that I submit. This deck has had even less testing than the first. I could’ve gone with another restricted deck, but I felt that this one represents something a bit different from some of my norms.<br />
<br />
Orlon starts off as a card draw magi. While I usually try to battle with my first magi, this time it really is a magi just around to draw into the rest of the deck. I wasn’t sure how this would work. However, since he protects the very creatures useful for drawing, he seemed like a good starter.<br />
<br />
Next is the heart of the deck. Brothers of Vengeance. This dual magi never appealed to me until restricted. As I was wondering how to make a working Orothe deck with so many of my favorite tricks gutted out, I really considered this magi duo for the first time. Since much of the control has been trimmed from what I thought to be ideal levels, I had to consider how to create an Orothe swarm. The deck would have to perform much better in attacks than I normally use Orothe decks. Vast numbers of creatures and much healing would be necessary. Thus, the brothers.<br />
<br />
To compliment the brothers, I chose a small theme of stealing relics. With the cube and crushing, it might not be possible to eliminate opposing relics, but it should be possible to better ensure that this deck has more under its control than the opponent.<br />
<br />
So, how has this deck done so far? Oh, very devastating. Since Ormagon and Cataclysm failed to make the cut for restricted, this deck stands a lot taller since it is no longer necessary to hold an impressive reserve against such options. As for the deck being devastating, it was devastating to my opponent. The Brother’s of Vengeance were easily drawing cards and growing their creatures at an incredible rate. To be honest, I stopped using the Wellisks to discard creatures because the Wellisks were getting to be bigger than the creature played. An eight energy Wellisk is quite impressive.... In short, the Brothers of Vengeance started chewing through the opposing magi quite nicely. They usually had over twenty energy in creatures when they defeated one magi and moved on to the next.<br />
<br />
Again, I want to remind others that this deck hasn’t had extensive testing. If I wanted to post a deck with several tests, then I would’ve posted my Naroom Restricted Deck. I can only hope this Orothe deck remains consistent with what little testing it has had.<br />
<br />
Well, here’s a fun dilemma. With my other posts on DeckTech, I have made it a habit to post alternates for rare cards. It is not a habit I intend to stop at the moment.<br />
<br />
Coral Hyren — Iximin<br />
Deep Barl — Book of Ages<br />
Hurricane Orish — Karak<br />
Orathan — Seaweed Lascinth<br />
Hubdra’s Cube — Ancestral Flute<br />
Orothean Gloves — Tomorrow’s Jewel<br />
<br />
That’s a bit different. Usually I recommend creatures to replace creatures.... The Seaweed Lascinth might make a good swap for the Coral Hyren or Hurricane Orish if you have the Orathans to go with. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
