He should last awhile with the energy that he is getting. If you ever lose control with Voda, don&#39;t be afraid to suicide him, it&#39;s always better to lose a Magi then have them gain obscene amounts of energy.<br><br>Mobis is here cause he has a lot of energy, he can tidal wave their largest creatures then play a mini-army and still have energy left over. He also starts a Wellisk, which most people don&#39;t like to be on the receiving end of.<br><br>Quilla is here be cause she is just that good. Her seven energize should carry you through most of what you want to do, but always be cautious.<br>
<br><br>Xyx Minors are in here because they work very well with the gloves, Arderial players pay two for five, you pay three for five. But they really shine if they live for more than one turn with the gloves out.<br><br>I like phrup, most people don&#39;t, but I do. It delays them a turn, but usually having them not do what they wanted to do, could keep the game in your favor (assuming it was already going in your favor).<br><br>Platheus is here cause he&#39;s large and has a useful Power. He has to be kind of large for Voda; losing control in the early game can be bad if you don&#8217;t have a way to kill off opposing creatures. Most people like to keep between 3 and 5 energy creatures on the board, he just big enough to take Voda back then. His Power can be use when they have more creatures than you do, or you just don&#39;t want them to attack you.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
