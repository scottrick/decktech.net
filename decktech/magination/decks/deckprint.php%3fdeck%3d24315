Total Card Count: 40    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck plays much like the Broken Blu deck. Your goal is to lock your opponent with Mydra Swarm so that they never draw cards again, while putting pressure on them with creatures to use up the card resources they have, and cycling your deck with all of Bograth&#39;s mad card drawing. I have 8 ways to *Boots* a creature out before the attack step. *Boots* is a term I use with this deck for any of the methods to get a guy out before the attack/play creatures step. <br>
<br>
Magi Explanations: <br>
<br>
Baa: He&#39;s the opener/set up Magi. Get all your starting creatures. Play EVERY creature you get *cept for Mist Hyren if you draw him* and pay one additional to draw an extra at end of turn. Usually you should have 4 creatures, so you can use Slarnath&#39;s demand on first turn, giving you 8 cards in hand at end of turn. <br>
<br>
Emlob: Power Magi. His *Imaginary Friends* effect fuels this deck like mad, giving you 3 extra cards from Moss Quido, 3 extra energy from Moob, and allowing you to Swarm with only one creature in play. <br>
<br>
Blygt: Backup Magi. If you get hosed down too quickly, Blygt is your chance to regain control. Waking Dreams insures that you have creatures in play for all your little powers. Not only that, you get to choose your 3 best creatures. Usually your opponent should choose the Moss Quido to die, leaving you with a Moob *always take it when you have the option* and Green Stuff *comes in at 1 from Blygt, gains from from its effect, totaling 2 energy*. <br>
<br>
Card Explanations: <br>
<br>
I tried to keep this deck as versatile with the creatures I could, and low on the energy curve. With the mass amounts of card drawing, multiple copies of some of the *utility* creatures wasn&#39;t neccessary, allowing me to focus on my goal while still having support and options. <br>
<br>
Green Stuff: Free creature. He energizes, so if he&#39;s not killed, he can kill small creatures and still keep gaining. He works well with Crushing Stench and Blygt, gaining the extra energy on top of what they give him when he comes in play. Very energy efficient creature. <br>
<br>
Ainjer: Mostly for my energy curve I had in mind. His ability is useful against Zannah, Burrow, and Baby Furok. Boots/Trulb/Crush/Trulb Horde him in if you really need to in order to use his effect before the attack step. <br>
<br>
Bolobog: Starting for Baa. Can be useful to pump the Fog Hyren up to draw more cards, or to allow one of your other creatures to punk out a larger opposing creature. <br>
<br>
Moob: Read him. He&#39;s insane energy advantage. Recycle him lots to gain lots of energy; that&#39;s whathe does. <br>
<br>
Trulb: Energy curve and utility. If I don&#39;t have a Moss Quido, I&#39;ll *Boots* him in to search for a Moss Quido if I can, then use the Quido to draw into my deck. I use him to find Moobs when I&#39;m low on energy. Green Stuff is a good 3rd choice because he comes in at 2e if you can&#39;t find either of the other two creatures. <br>
<br>
Treepsh: Card drawing and protection. Use him early to search for needed Moss Quido&#39;s and *Boots*. Use him when you&#39;re gaining control to protect your guys. <br>
<br>
Swamp Weebo: Energy Curve, starting card, and swarm control. I don&#39;t use this guy often, but I had space and he&#39;s a starting card. The few times I&#39;ve used him, its been like dropping a bomb on another swarm deck ;p <br>
<br>
Much Vinoc: Utility. He kills large things easily, considering the Rayje&#39;s Shield and Ooze Arboll. <br>
<br>
Ooze Arboll: Utility. He&#39;s there to help pump my guys to help against Cald and Core Crag. He also helps transitions the deck from setup to delivery by pumping my guys to kill opposing Magi quickly. When I go into aggression mode, I start Cycling this guy with Bog Stone every turn. <br>
<br>
Slarnath: Card Drawing. <br>
<br>
Moss Quido: The engine for the deck. He acts like a Weggit for creatures. I put in 8 forms to *boots* him out to draw as much as possible. Leaving him in play till the next turn isn&#39;t an option due to belt, and the fact my opponent always finds a way to kill him. <br>
<br>
Fog Hyren: Card drawing. Options. Energy Curve. His Dreamwarp effect is strong, letting him come out at 4e most of the time. There have been times when I needed something large to take out a troublesome opposing creature. He&#39;s very versatile. <br>
<br>
Mist Hyren: A finisher, and target. If they don&#39;t kill this guy, its gonna be bad news. He will eat anything they put out. He also helps kill Magi very quickly. He&#39;s very efficient as well. <br>
<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: Duh... For the Trulbs, Moss Quidos, and occasionaly Moobs. <br>
<br>
Relic Stalker: One copy in every deck is my rule. <br>
<br>
Bog Stone: Recursion of Moss Quido, Moob, Muck Vinoc, and Ooze Arboll. <br>
<br>
Great Pool of Wisdom: Free card drawing. If you have 7 guys out, its guaranteed card until its shut down somehow. <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Shield: Simply Amazing. As many cards as I draw, it adds one to all my guys a turn. It lets Slarnath demand without energy loss. It lets Fog Hyren get some extra draws in. It keeps Mist Hyren alive after an Ambush. So very good in Bograth, wish I would have had one earlier for this deck. <br>
<br>
Thunderquake: Creature removal and suicide mechanism for Baa. <br>
<br>
Trulb Horde: Another form of Warrior&#39;s Boots for Bograth. Extremely efficient for Moss Quido... my preferred method of *Boots* for him since I&#39;m gonna discard him to draw cards anyways. <br>
<br>
Vard Stampede: Utility. <br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm: Broken lock mechanism... all in one card. This should of never been printed. Just cycle it over and over. <br>
<br>
Crushing Stench: Creature removal and *boots*. In dire circumstances, you can use it on one of your own creatures to get a Moss Quido out before the attack step to start drawing with, to prevent you from stalling out on the lock. Otherwise, kill your opponents stuff when possible with it ;p <br>
<br>
Goals: <br>
<br>
1. Draw Lots of cards. Moss Quido is the engine for this. Get out some guys as set up if you can. Multiple *boots* Quido&#39;s works well,t hen start sacking them and dropping out more guys before the attack step to keep your draw rate per Quido high. <br>
<br>
2. Recycle. Pretty much covered as above, but make sure you do everything you can to thin your deck. Use Trulbs when you can. Be as effecient as you can. Use them before you start drawing with the Quidos to improve your chance of drawing Mydra Swarm and *Boots* by searching out more Quido&#39;s and Moobs. <br>
<br>
3. Energy. Gain as much as you can every turn with the Moobs, Ooze Arboll *When you go aggressive*, and Rayje&#39;s Shield. <br>
<br>
4. Board/Hand Control. Start Tquaking what you have to. Attack to kill creatures. This deck requires baiting. You have to deplete your opponents hand. If they don&#39;t try to stop you, just gain lots of energy before you kill their current Magi. They&#39;re never going to draw more options when you&#39;re swarming every turn. Just bide your time &#39;till they have no more options but to roll over and die.<br>
<br>
5. Aggression. When you&#39;ve got them in position, go for the kill. Gain all the energy you can on your guys every turn with Ooze Arboll. Use Mist Hyren to punk out large defenders, and try to kee as many of your creatures alive during attacks as you can. Try to manage a lock, but its not a crucial. The landslide has already started. Just try to keep your cycle going so that you Swarm every turn, and you&#39;re ok. <br>
<br>
Lastly: NEVER over extend. One well placed Ormagon, Nalo, Deep Hyren, Catyclysm, Gravel Storm, etc, will annihilate you during your setup part of the game. Always keep some reserve guys in hand so you can drop them and swarm if your guys get wiped. Also, try to save a Warrior&#39;s Boots or Trulb Horde to get a Quido out to help reset and find more Swarms and Creatures, and recycle, to recover in case of an emergency. Be patient during the first 3 turns and you&#39;ll be fine. &quot;Never play anything you don&#39;t have to,&quot; is a good rule to live by in Magi Nation. <br>
<br>
Notes of interest: <br>
<br>
I played this deck at the Invitational at Origins. I knew it had a shot at beating the Construct deck I was sure would make an appearance. My friend Ron played this version as well, and did alright. He drew first round with a team mate of his, and lost to the same guy I did. We lost to a Paradwyn Bloom/Drain deck with Poison Baloo Roots and mad card drawing. Extremely tough matchup. I advanced to the final 4 of approximately 20 people at the tournament. I was paired up again with the Paradywn deck that defeated me earlier. Due to some play mistakes by my opponent, and luck, I managed to defeat him and place 2nd. Chris Jilot had his deck running on 2nd turn. He had also scouted me when I was playtesting in the corner before the tourney, fearing my lock deck, and meta&#39;d for me... which was a huge part of my loss... besides his amazing draws ;) I was proud I made it to final 8 in the Storyline, and then placed second in the following tourney. Also, Chris was concerned about matching up with this deck, and ran a copy or two of Entagle to lock me out of Mydra Swarm, lol ;p <br>
<br>
All in all, I did good. This deck, and the Construct deck are both going to be MRP&#39;d very soon, so don&#39;t plan on being able to play it very long. I&#39;m quite glad they will be gone... hopefully soon I&#39;ll be able to play Underneath as a viable region/deck in a tourney and win. *sigh* But for now, we&#39;re stuck having to use energy loops and various locks to compete in big tournies. Hopefully it won&#39;t be this way forever. <br>
<br>
Responses: <br>
<br>
The planned MRP for Mydra Swarm, I believe, is wording so that it can only be played every other turn, as opposed to every turn. I also feel that Shell *the lock for the Construct Deck and Aikido 2* should have the same wording. I plan to bring this up when I can, and hopefully some things will get fixed soon:) <br>
<br>
