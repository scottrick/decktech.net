DECK STRATEGY, otherwise, grab a drink, and read on.<br>
<br>
Yeah, so its pretty funny how things end up working in the long run.  Most of the decks that Ive played and ended up winning events with have either started out as a joke, or a challenge.  This was a bit of both.<br>
I cant take all the credit, the initial idea to my amusement was taken up by Bart Robinson, and moved to a different region, had a lot of different deck changes, and ended up with what we both played.<br>
<br>
When Nightmares Dawn came out, and we saw what Heal had ended up as, we looked at it, and started joking how broken that it was, because you could use with, with 5 creatures, and an Orothean Belt to gain 10 energy for a mere 4!  Everyone had a good laugh, we came up with a deck where OQua could go second to grab the Belt, and drop a creature swarm, and fill them with energy.  Everyone had a good laugh, but the deck was put on the back burner, never to be built.<br>
<br>
During Origins, sitting in our hotel room, really too tired to do anything, but too excited from winning the storyline to go to sleep, I decided to build a deck.  Whatd I come up with?  LotS of DotS and VotS.  I didnt want it to be like any typical Arderial deck, so I wasnt playing anything standard.  It was a bunch of Xyxs, and all the Arderial/Orothe Creatures to go with VotS.  Being about 10 cards short from what Id normally play, I went digging for random things to throw into the deck.  Came across Pharan, said This combos with Spray Narth, its going in!  We had a pretty good laugh, and I finished putting the deck together, Pharans and all.  Playing it the next day, I had a blast with it, and the Pharan/Spray Narth worked great, it was an energy refill just when I needed it, and the deck had the card drawing to compliment it, so it wasnt a waste of card space either, it was great.<br>
<br>
After Origins, looking at what was left for us to play after the erratas, we put together a few decks, but wasnt as happy with any of them as we were with Janky Construct.  Something about not being able to gain 100+ energy every turn on a highly consistent basis will do that to you I suppose.  Our main idea was to go for control, and Will of Orothe/Entangle lock seemed to be the best thing, but it wasnt guaranteed, and it took a lot of energy each turn, and little to no disruption of your combo.  Our main Will of Entangle deck was Orothe/Arderial, with lots of card cycle, and the energy gain through Pharan and Spray Narth.  After about a week of testing, it was coming up short on energy quite often, since card drawing is pricey, and Will of Entangle is pricey, being 7 energy in the best scenario.  We needed to draw everything in the right order, and couldnt consistently pull it off on the second turn.  We werent very happy.<br>
<br>
We dropped Orothe for a bit, and started testing more on other things.  Everything Bograth, Cald Spell, Arderial Blitz, Stompy Naroom, and even old fashioned Orothe, starting Voda and everything.  But it didnt feel the same, and none of it felt right.  There were decks that would be built, fanned through once, and then thrown on the floor.  It was just that bad.  I pretty much knew that Id be playing something Orothe, just for the control aspect, and even if it wasnt guaranteed, it was the best chance I would have vs. everything.  The biggest problem it had was losing very consistently to Cald Spell.  The one deck that is Barts most hated matchup, so he wasnt very keen on playing Orothe at this point.<br>
<br>
I was testing the deck pretty heavy, getting the right metagame, and doing everything I could to beat Cald Spell, and Arderial, since Cataclysm could wreck the deck at the right moment.  At first I had Quill in there as the Universal answer, then a few days later realized that you cant Overwrite anything on an opposing Cataclysm.  Stupid card text.  So digging for something else to be able to handle it, I decide that Storm of Fishes is a great answer for that, since Arderial doesnt play any anti-discard as standard, and it should hit them every time.  That ended up being a godsend.<br>
<br>
The last feat to overcome being Cald.  Which ended up with what the deck became known for, and thats the Phrup Lock.  We lost to Cald Spell so much because of Bloom.  And Im not sure why we overlooked the little guy for so long, I guess we just werent focused enough.  We had to change the way we played the game, going to our play creatures before doing anything else, so we could have Phrups in play, but it ended up giving us that initial first turn we needed to set up our game.   Therefore giving us the same percentage win vs. Cald that we had against every other deck.  It was golden.  We were content enough, and the rest of the story you all know.<br>
<br>
DECK STRATEGY<br>
<br>
We should all know and love OQua by now, and the start was the same exact thing we did in Janky Construct.  Try to go first.  Conjure a Bubble Xyx and use Burst.  Either Sorreahs Dream the Burst, play another Xyx and Burst again, or play a Sea Barl and use Lore.  End your first turn with 12-13 cards in hand, and smile.  OQua will die pretty quick, and if she doesnt, just draw more cards.  Shell die eventually.<br>
<br>
Voice of the Storms is a beautiful, broken Magi.  Her strategy is simple, play everything, and win you the game.  She combines two of the most powerful regions in the game together, and gives herself some cost reduction for playing those two regions.  So you get to be energy efficient while having access to the best stuff in the game.  Neat, huh?  Youll start the Hurricane Orish, and unless youve got it already, youll start the Cloud Sceptre.  If youve already got the Sceptre, its a toolbox situation.  Take whatever will benefit you the most depending on what your opponents have in play.  Otherwise, grab the Orothean Gloves to make all the powers on your card drawing creatures cost less.  It also makes Sorreahs Dreamed copies of your powers cast less.  Youll want to play out as many creatures as you can, since theyll all have a reduced cost from the Diplomacy effect.  Youll use River Abaquists to gain immeadiate control of the board, stealing any creatures that your opponent has played until this point.  Youll have enough card draw/cycling to ensure you make it to the bottom of your deck, so use anything you possibly can to be able to use it again next turn.  All copies of Warriors Boots should be played, Thunderquake should be used if there are any remaining creatures on the board past River Abaquist, and you should use all the Pharans and Spray Narths you were able to play to place energy back on your Magi.  Use Heal to add one energy to 5 different creatures, which with the Orothean Belt in play, youll spend 4 to gain 10.  All of these things give you a giant machine.  Gaining energy, drawing cards, and stealing your opponents stuff.  Its an engine.  Once the engine begins, its next to impossible to shut down.  The reason for this: Phrup.  Youll look at your opponents hand using Hand of the Sky.  If theres something there that you can use in the way of a spell, then take it and play it.  If theres no anti-discard, use Storm of Fishes to empty whatever is useful out of their hand to ensure your path to victory even more.  The only things that you should really worry about, is spells.  Because your Deep Wellisk should never let a relic into play.  By analyzing your opponents hand, you also know if theres anything theyll be able to do that actually affects your machine.  If there isnt, youve won already, otherwise, you use your Phrups on whatever will hurt you.  Youve got the constant source of energy gain thats way above your energize, and youre able to put it on your creatures, and on your Magi.  The rest of your game should be played on Voice, and if you grab control, you shouldnt lose it outside of your own mistakes.<br>
<br>
Bria is the third magi here just for her ability to play Arderial and Orothe relics.  The idea is the same for Bria as it is for Voice, it just costs a lot more energy to do everything.  I never got to Bria and still won the game, however, because usually if I got the Bria, I got a very bad draw with no card drawing, or my opponent found an answer to my machine that I hadnt thought of.<br>
<br>
At Gencon, I played everything from basic creature swarm (Arderial, Naroom, Paradwyn, Bograth), which was my easiest match, to the mirror match, Will of Entangle lock, Dark Twins control, Discard Lock, Cald Spell, and Pure energy.  I played vs. everything, and I lost only two games, drawing in another.  Lost one game to my own mistakes, and I lost one game to a really great draw by Cald spell, the draw was against the Will of Entangle lock, where I didnt have the necessary card drawing going into Voice.<br>
<br>
The deck was able to beat Pure Energy by the mere fact that I found out what the general deck was, and planned a strategy before even sitting down against one of them.  I knew that if I could keep Phrups in play to be able to stop any one piece of the combo, I would have the energy gain to take out their third Magi, which was the only magi they could set up on.  This also involved me being able to get to Voice before they got into Shaper, which was only a one magi drop for me, but since their deck was designed to suicide their Magi each turn, it was possible that I wouldnt have been able to.  The other thing I had was the potential to get through a Storm of Fishes right before they went into Shaper to knock the combo out of their hand.  That worked twice, out of the five times I played against the deck.  Once I was just lucky, and he didnt have the Abraxins Crown.  The second time I actually had to Storm into the Crown, and then use Pharans and Narths to add energy back to my Magi.  I reshuffled the deck at the end of the turn, using the next turn to draw my deck, and Storm away half of his hand, which contained the combo.  All of the games I played against this deck were hard games, and very well played.  I was happy to be able to beat the deck, despite the lack of knowledge before the tournament, but lets face the facts.  If there was any other deck sitting across the table from me in that final game, everyone would have been rooting for the other guy, because I was just playing a control deck as well.<br>
<br>
I want to thank everyone who helped make this deck as good as it turned out to be, my thanks out to Bart Robinson and Jeff Swim for that.  Id also like to give my respect to the players who played Pure Energy, especially Stephen Strand, whom I played in the final game of the World Championship.  Had I not persisted with the idea of control, I know that one of them surely would have taken that tournament instead of me.  People look at them, and many of my opponents looked at me as taking away from the fun of the game, when the fact is that its a game.  Theres always going to be someone playing a deck type you dont like.  Either you learn to beat it, and dont worry about it, or you stay a very bitter person.  It was a World Championship, the competition was bound to be tough, and things like this should have been expected.<br>
