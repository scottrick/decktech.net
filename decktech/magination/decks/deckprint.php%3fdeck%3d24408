Hello all you happy people. Ive been using this deck for league and its been winning a lot. I think its been winning because everyone here sucks.<br>
<br><br>
 Tiller. Tiller is prob. the best naroom magi to use first. he is grrrrreat for getting those well needed cards to set up your next magi. i usually dont get off of him but sometimes i do but my next magi tears up my opponent. Tiller starts with weebo and weeblit. you would think to use weeblit and add 5 to someone, but i use his two powers to discard weebo and weeblit to draw 3. I always draw something i can use because all my cards are usful, except dream balm, i just discard that with tillers power. What you basically do with tiller is dont do dumb things, mainly play weaker creatures like tree hinko and eebit. eebit last a long time usually, unless it gets a spell used on it, but hey, thats wut twee is for. use giant carillion with k&#39;teeb cub or sap of life. make sure to use tree hinkos power for tiller cause there isnt very much else that helps him gain energy.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
 Yaki. Yaki is the attacker of naroom. While on tiller, when you draw the one warrior&#39;s boots, save it for yaki, unless an emergency comes up. Use the boots on a furok, and then use that one grow on it to attack one of your opponents creatures so yaki can get some more energy. Use dem offensive creatures with this boy like bhatar. I dont usually get to yaki, so i dont have a lot of strategy developed for him, basically play creatures and attack twice with em. If you draw G. Carillion, he can be a good offensive creature too.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
 Pruitt. No one has made it this far, but ive had past experience with her so i kind of no wut to do. I have that one carillion in here for her starting card, and grow too. What you want to do with her, is play those creatures, and keep the energy around the same on all her creatures. She has a very nice power too. Cost 2, add three to a creautre. you will probably cycled through the deck twice or more if you play it right and you can get more giant carillions and weebos. Since your not using tiller now, u can feel free to use that weeblit, but i would play robe of vines, and then weebo with g. carillion, and use g carillions power, then weebos power which leaves him at one, and weeblit it.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
