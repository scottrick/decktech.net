Here is a rundown on exactly how this deck works...<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
O&#39;Qua : Yes, O&#39;Qua in a cald deck.  Draw as much as possible.  Of Course conjure a bubble xyx, etc.  Just keep her in and conjure xyx&#39;s as long as you can (3 turns) then kill her off.  Your hand should be of decent size now.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Sinder : Sinder rules.  Yes, he does...  Don&#39;t worry about starting cards, you should have plenty in your hand.  Drop a pylofuf, granas, braggle... whatever creatures you happen to think useful at the time.  If you can, put out a dream channel and/or a nightmare channel on a granas or pylofuf.  The braggles are the key to this deck, so use them wisely.  Play a heat lens if you have one.  This is good for taking out direct removal from thier hand.  Also, hold onto a sinder&#39;s mantle if you have one.  Play it on the relic phase before the attack next turn.  Riptide!  Totally shut down ALL card draw decks in a flash.  HEHE.  You have the heatlens also to make sure they don&#39;t have any discard prevention.  Sinder will go far, because he also has that add two energy for one power.  You energize for seven with dream channel, so spend one to add two to a burrowed creature.  The perfect number when dealing with burrow.  The braggle will have a ton of energy, because you use sinder&#39;s mantle to pump him up, along with sinders power, and heal.  It turns out to be REALLY powerful.  The focuses are there for quick energy.  Play them when you defeat a magi, and you are sitting behind a 20+energy Braggle, and a 12+ energy granas.  You will energize for 21 if you have a channel out. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Gar:  Generally the same stradegy as sinder.  Play carefully, and think hard.  Gar is powerful. Also, the crowns are there to prevent discard.  Since you don&#39;t get starting cards, every card matters.  Hold on to the crowns.  NEVER play them unless you can defeat a magi with it  (a thermal blast on magi or somthing.)<br>

None of your creatures die, and they have a smalll hand... they can&#39;t hurt you in the least...  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
