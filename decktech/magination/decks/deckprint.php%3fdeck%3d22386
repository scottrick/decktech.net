<br><br>
For those of you who like Thunderquake drop the Wildfires for x2 Thunderquake. I decided I would not use thunderquake in this deck. It is entombed easily and I think wildfire serves the deck just as well. =P<br>
<br><br>
Drop the Arbolit, and the thermal blast for x2 Gorgles Glasses. Sure cfbnv, I&#39;ll fly with it for a while. =P<br>
<br><br>
As another alternative, the Dryte Fiends are fun, but slightly expensive at 6, if you like you can drop them for two Ithapher, which is probably the stronger of the two creatures =P<br>

**Response to reviews:**<br>
<br><br>
I would like to start by saying sidar29 is a complete idiot. Thank you.<br>
<br><br>
cfbnv: You are absolutely right! The glasses are the 41st card in the deck, because even starting with Barak does not give you more cards, and card advantage really enhances the deck entirely. However it&#39;s hard to drop any cards, maybe you&#39;ve got an idea of what could go for two of the glasses. If anything, I&#39;d say the Arbolit and the Thermal Blast could go, they are really in just as starting cards. The thermal blast can help early, although it may be better to add glasses, and when Barak starts to just take the Balamant and pick up 4. Hmm... Barak can help with the card advantage a little, he gives you cards you want with his power, but that of course is different from drawing more cards. It could help, just to make sure your spells don&#39;t run dry. The glasses will help keep the pressure on. Dmail me with ideas.<br>
<br><br>
**END**<br>
<br><br>
This is the next revision to the cald removal theme. The new kids on the block are the Core Grag and Dryte Fiend, (hence the name Core Values) Both are very strong creatures, the Core Grag is amazing when used with a scroll, considering it just about always clears the board entirely, and it also takes 3E from the magi. The Warrior&#39;s Boots were dropped because they didn&#39;t help much, there&#39;s no real advantage to playing these creatures during your p/s/r phase other than you getting the creature to attack with. The deck is less about attack beatdown, and more about removal. This deck can compete very easily against just about anything out there. Give Vorga a good hand with Barak, and you will see why the deck is so strong. It&#39;s a great feeling when your opponent has to ask permission to play a creature. Can I please play my Forest Hyren? Will you please not kill it? <br>
<br><br>
Generally, remove all your opponent energy faster than he can keep it on the board. The key is control. You&#39;ll be amazed how much energy you can directly remove. Even a hopeless situation can often be turned around with a few well placed spells and some of your creatures awesome powers and effects.<br>
<br><br>
The Magi:<br>
<br><br>
Barak: Barak is strong because of his massive starting energy. You have energy, your opponent doesn&#39;t. He also lets you search for cards with his power. With so much speed and energy to go around combine with prophecy, you gain momentum quickly. Barak can take down just about any first magi, if his excessive energy doesn&#39;t do it your removal will.<br>
<br><br>
Vorga: Vorga is the heart and soul of cald removal. She is a serious threat to any opposing magi, her power Shatter combine with being handed a Scroll of Fire right off can burn through creatures at an unbelievable rate. If Barak can get you a nice hand, Vorga&#39;s removal and her Shatter power will rip you a new one. And I mean that.<br>
<br><br>
Gar is a finisher. He has high starting energy, and his power is free, which lets you use your energy for other things. If Gar comes out, look for a beatdown. Play the Balamant and some other creatures, add your energy, and look for a way to finish off your opponent.<br>
<br><br>
The Creatures:<br>
<br><br>
They are focused on removal above all else. The combo is Ergars, Arbolls, and Magma Hyrens using spark with scroll of fire. Lava Balamant is your bruiser, and a starting card for Barak and Gar. The Core Grag gets sacrificed to do 3E to all creatures in play and 4E off the magi. The Dryte Fiend keeps your creatures alive and prevents them from getting beaten down easily. Raxis is for relic protection.<br>
<br><br>
The Relics:<br>
<br><br>
The relics are for taking out pesky Gaurd Wings and Shadow Cloaks, or anything else that can stop you short term. Lock it down, Pound it, use Raxis, or Vorga, just make sure there is nothing to stand in your way. Your 3 scrolls are to make every card in your deck hurt even more.<br>
<br><br>
The Spells:<br>
<br><br>
Ahh the spells. The theme is removal. Your opponent can&#39;t win when all his creatures are knocked down 4 or 5E, killed, etc. each turn. Take them down faster than your opponent can keep up. Wildfire is used for weenie hoards like weave decks. Pay 5 to take 3E off each creature (with scroll) Syphon Vortex takes a lot of criticism from people who think it is too expensive. Let me tell you something about this card... First of all, there are only 2 in the deck. Some are used when you flip a fresh magi, but if you are low on energy you can use a giant arbolls power to move all that to your magi, (if you have one in play) Giant Arbolls get very big because of the tinder power, so it gives you the energy you need. Sometimes it cannot be played, but it only costs you 4E no matter what, which is a deal. Thats all, and good luck!<br>
