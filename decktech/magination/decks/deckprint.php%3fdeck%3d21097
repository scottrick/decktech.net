Total: 40 + 3 Magi   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First off, the magi selection and order.  Voda is a beast in the first position. It can be beneficial to go first or second with him, but I would go first most of the time and play Coral and Reef Hyren.  Then submerge the Reef Hyren and you&#39;re pretty much set.  At this point you and your opponent will have a continuous standoff as to who can gain the largest creature for the purposes of Deluge.  This is why I play 9, that&#39;s right, 9 direct removal spells.  If they start to get out of control, you should have the direct removal to deal with it.  <br>
<br>
If you didn&#39;t notice from the deck list, this deck has the capabilities to get what it wants, when it wants it.  With the Sea Barls, Deep Barls, and Orothean Goggles, you can fill up your hand with Orothean goodness every turn and take full advantage of Voda&#39;s gargantuan creatures.<br>
<br>
Against many players and many decks, Voda will be able to win you the game without even looking to Orlon or Quilla for help.  But the beauty of this deck is, if they do manage to defeat the juggernaut that is Voda, they have only just begun.<br>
<br>
Orlon comes out sluggish, but slowly and surely begins taking the upper hand.  A six energize is not too shabby, and if you can even manage to play one barl or wellisk a turn your opponent will begin to get swamped.  Since they can&#39;t target your barls and wellisks with spells, half of the stuff in their hand becomes useless.  But here&#39;s the beauty of it: Your removal spells DO still work.  It is insane just how much you can do to your opponent to keep them down, here&#39;s an example:<br>
<br>
Orlon hits the board and your opponent has a few creatures on the table.  You play a Wellisk, an Abaquist, Submerge the Abaquist, a Phrup, and a Sea Barl.  Three of those are starting for Orlon, so it&#39;s not too iffy.  You then take control of one of the opponents creatures with the Abaquist.  You then Undertow their other creature.  On their turn, they try and play two creatures which promptly get Wellisked and Phruped, and since they can&#39;t take out the Barl with spells you get to attack for the win.  It doesn&#39;t always require so much energy for you to pull tricks like that, or so many cards, but do the massive drawing power you can pretty much do whatever you want.<br>
<br>
So your opponent&#39;s pretty good, and they manage to kill Orlon.  You&#39;ve got one final trick up your sleeve, and she&#39;s reaaalll nasty: Quilla.  A high starting energy and an UNREAL energize coupled with a barqua&#39;s bubble and hubdra&#39;s cube means you can just abuse your opponent.  You could also pull the Goggles if you don&#39;t already have them so that you can grab what you want, when you want it.<br>
<br>
She slices, dices, plays a ton of creatures, and can afford one to two direct removal spells a turn to really give your opponent a headache.  Wellisk, Phrup, and all the direct removal means if your opponent does manage to get some stuff on the board it&#39;s not going to stay for long.  If they manage to make it to Quilla, they better have said their prayers.<br>
<br>
So what are the weaknesses?  You think a Rayje&#39;s Belt might hurt, right?  Rayje&#39;s Cloak superhero is here to save the day.  Dark Twins prominent in your area?  I think Submerging and Deluging a Deep Hyren every turn with some Phrup food means they&#39;ll be hard pressed to keep many creatures on the table.  Reef Hyren is a beast as well, and when you get multiples on the board any Cald or Vellup swarm is going to bite the dust.  <br>
