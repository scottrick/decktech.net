<br>
 The deck is based on draining the opponent. This means that it drains their magi through Ninx and Spirit Drains and also drains their creatures with Baloo Roots and Abaquists. In essence it is a control deck,since it tries to have an answer to everything the opponent plays and tries to maintain control of the board. <br>
<br>
 Ninx is the base of the deck. She has a build in drain power. Usually,she will be the only magi the deck will use. With her,you want to go second and use all her energy then hit the opponent to ensure that no mass removal is used. If she goes first,you should try to use all the drawing to get her a Bloom/Pendant. In any case,Ninx uses all her energy every turn and makes sure she draws the cards to be able to do that.Gremble and Hyrens are key cards with her. Gremble works wonders with her,since Ninx can play the relics she gets,play most of the creatures then pop it to refill her hand.<br>
<br>
 If they kill Ninx,Eryss steps in. A mainly drawing magi,but all those cards can help her to achieve control. Eryss should keep a little energy on her,but it isn&#39;t essential to do so if she can drain the opposing magi to make sure that no mass removal hits. With Eryss try to hit the opponent fast and go for the kill as soon as possible,since she can draw cards but she can&#39;t maintain control for too long.<br>
<br>
 Yricho is used last.He is a magi used for max energy abuse with a Pendant and some Blooms. The main creatures with him should be Baloo Roots and Mydras. A well timed Spirit Drain can win the game for him. <br>
<br>
Some notes:<br>
<br>
Robe of Petals should be used with Eryss if she has it when Ninx goes or Yricho if Eryss got it.<br>
With Ninx is of no use,while it is a nice energy boost if used with the others.<br>
<br>
Treepsh is used for drawing and also offers some kind of protection.<br>
<br>
Mydra looks like a card that would be used only as a starting card,but in fact it looks pretty nice. It&#39;s ability helps with the drain theme(makes the opponent throw their energy away)but also helps with the energy curve of the deck. Things that can be warped from 3-5 are always useful since the can have many uses,from keeping your magi alive to being a random beatdown creature.<br>
<br>
Yes,know that the Cape has received errata,but it still is very helpful. It not only gives 10 energy to a N&#39;kala/Treepsh/Gremble with a Bagala Fangs but also restores Fog Hyrens,Baloo Roots and K&#39;teebs to their starting energy. A favorite combo is to warp a Hyren to 5,a Root to 3 and a K&#39;teeb to 6,use Wither with Root and Obscure Knowledge with the others,next turn Double Obscure and Wither(through Dream Cross),leave every thing with 1,then cape them. The deck still uses the cape because it has energy spending powers.The cape may not work in an Ookami deck since it has nothing to offer to weenies,but when it comes to this deck,i can use my powers to gain some cards and hit the opponent creatures without using any energy.<br>
<br>
The Rayje&#39;s Belt is needed,since it takes care of the occasional burrow/True Grit/anything.Note that it is not the only thing i can do against burrow or other powers,but more of a last resort when everything else fails.<br>
