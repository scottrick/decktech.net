TOTAL: 41 Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Basically, this deck occurred out of a mix of &quot;Deck Too Big&quot; and favoratism,<br>
but I&#39;m surprised at how well it came together.  If there are any instances<br>
where you think there should be more of a card, it&#39;s because all my other<br>
copies of those cards (if I HAVE other copies) went to my other Naroom deck,<br>
which I&#39;ll be posting soon.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the strategy here is to give Yaki enough good creatures that he<br>
can use to pound an opponent flat with his gloves!  Whee! Take your pick<br>
between the Furok and the Dark Furok as his starting card.  If you want to<br>
kill more stuff, take the Dark Furok.  If you think you&#39;ll need the energy,<br>
though, take the furrier, friendlier Furok to help you out.<br>
<br>
If you can manage to get the Tree Hinkos out while Yaki still bashes stuff,<br>
things just get easier--especially with big guys like the Monarch Hyren and two<br>
Giant Carillions in the mix.  Vim and Vigor might help as well if your opponent<br>
has creatures like the Chaos Jile, Wudge, or anything else that tends to <br>
beef up well--which, by the way, is why the Jip&#39;s there.  If I had more, they&#39;d<br>
fit in nicely.  Just one&#39;s not enough, but when it&#39;s all you&#39;ve got...<br>
<br>
Otherwise, follow the basic strategy of Naroom:<br>
HIT STUFF!  But not blindly.  Make good use of multiple attacks from Carillions<br>
and Rudwots to clean out anything weak before hitting any larger creatures<br>
your opponent might have.  Use Tap Roots or Crushing Roots to weaken them<br>
to that very effect, if you can, and use Orwin&#39;s Gaze to get them back.<br>
(Three cards that I believe no Naroom deck should be without, if possible.  At<br>
the LEAST, just 2-3 copies of Tap Roots.) If you&#39;re up against a Core opponent,<br>
hope for the Tillant because then you&#39;ll have a creature that will pay for itself<br>
over, and over, and over again.  If you have more Tillants, feel free to use<br>
them.  I don&#39;t have more than 1, but if I had them they&#39;d be in there. If<br>
you&#39;re not fighting a Core opponent, then they&#39;re still a 6, and if you still<br>
would rather not use them then maybe you have a Vinoc that needs some<br>
energy.  I know I have a habit of racking up the cards in my hand, and Vinocs<br>
are a great way to effectively and purposefully cut down the size of a hand you<br>
don&#39;t have the energy (or desire, perhaps) to use.<br>
<br>
The Bungaloos, however mismatched in this deck, I love.  They&#39;re like free<br>
damage to your opponents!  They cost two, they hurt something, and then you<br>
put the 2 energy back on... whatever you want!  And in a pinch you can weave<br>
one energy off of them onto something you might need later, like that weebo<br>
or the ever-industrious Tree Hinko.  And, if you don&#39;t like them, they can<br>
always just be fodder cards for that Vinoc you might have in play.<br>
<br>
If you lose Yaki, don&#39;t despair!  After all, if you hinge your whole strategy on<br>
one Magi, you might as well play only sudden death! =)  Tryn and Pruitt are<br>
marvelous healers, letting you boost your creatures&#39; health at levels that have<br>
made my opponents... rather angry with me.  Need that Carillion to Stomp<br>
again, but don&#39;t want to lose your Weebo?  No problem, with these two.<br>
Pruitt&#39;s a little difficult to use compared to Tryn, but her Robe, adding her 5<br>
energize to one of your creatures and putting 2 on Pruitt herself, can help a<br>
great deal if you can deal with only energizing for 2 that turn--which, btw, is<br>
just enough to add 3 more energy to a creature of your choice with her version<br>
of Refresh.<br>
<br>
With all this Healing, one might be tempted to reverse their strategy and go<br>
into Wall Mode, powering up creatures and defending visciously.  Especially<br>
with that added little twist of a Mydra thrown in there.  Don&#39;t.  Keep attacking!<br>
(Well, except with your Mydra and Tree Hinkos.  Those have better uses)<br>
That&#39;s what the Dark Furok is in there for, after all.  A little taste of offense<br>
from the creepy version of a furry friend.<br>
<br>
So, the only things left are the Monarch Hyren and the other spattering of<br>
Universal stuff, right?  Well, Monarch Hyrens are awesome creatures.  You pay<br>
1, you get a Hyren, you play the Hyren.  Next turn, you add energy to it.  Good<br>
stuff there.  Heal&#39;s just a downright good card, especially when your creatures<br>
might exhaust themselves in 2-3 attacks per turn.  And Fate&#39;s whimsey, well...<br>
let me put it this way:  Dontcha just hate paying 3 energy for Grow just to watch<br>
that dice roll come up a 1 or 2?  Pay an extra and reroll it!  Well worth it most<br>
of the time, I assure you.  I wish I had more of that card, too.  They&#39;d be in<br>
there, just like Tillants and Jips.<br>
<br>
So there ya go.  It&#39;s a little simple and one-tracked, but that&#39;s what makes<br>
it work as well as it has for me.  Just be carefull of your weaknesses; cards<br>
like  Shockwaves &  Ormagons can make short work of your beautiful creatures,<br>
and a card like the Giant Chogus can simply obliterate a great many Naroom<br>
strategies that I&#39;ve used while playing this deck.  But, I&#39;ve made my point, and<br>
I&#39;m tired.  Off to bed with me!  z.z; </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
