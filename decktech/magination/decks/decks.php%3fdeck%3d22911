<br>
As you might have noticed I didn&#39;t have a strategy posted for a while, because it was deleted. Here it is again. Hopefully it will be just a good, although my heart really isn&#39;t in it the second time around :)<br>
<br>
Magi<br>
<br>
Baa:<br>
<br>
<br>
Baa serves only has 2 purposes: 1)Draw a Maelstrom 2)Draw cards to save for Blygt. The second isn&#39;t very hard since you draw at the very least 5 cards on your first turn. If you can draw a Maelstrom, Baa can die a happy magi. It doesn&#39;t matter if Baa kills a single opposing creature, or removes a single energy. I don&#39;t want to waste too much more time on Baa since he really doesn&#39;t have to do much. If you win the dice roll, I would suggest going first. I usually just pull the Slarnath, in this situation, then draw 4 random cards. This helps increase your chances of drawing a Maelstrom. If you are forced to go second, I would take all of his starting cards. You will have enough energy to pay the additional energy for each of the three creatures. If you draw a fourth, great. You will have enough to pay the extra energy for it too, and you will have enough creatures in play to use the Slarnath&#39;s power. If you have more creatures than your opponent, and you have a Treepsh out, use his power. Anyway that&#39;s all you really need to know about Baa.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Golthub: This is the stage where the Maelstrom is essential. When you first flip Golthub over, don&#39;t forget to take the Moob, he will really help once you get to Blygt. If all goes according to planned you should play the Maelstom on the opposing energy. Usually they won&#39;t have more than 20 energy. (Golthub is a 17/4 so he can remove 20 energy with a Maelstom) Next use Mire to kill all of the opposing creatures. This will kill both you and the opposing magi. Yes, I know this sounds crazy but Blygt is so powerful when you take into consideration how many cards he has in his hand by this point, and the fact that he comes into play against a newly flipped magi, who doesn&#39;t have 40 energy, and 6 creatures with 10 energy each. Golthub does a really good job of clearing the board, and giving Blygt an even fight against their second magi. Here are some things to know about Golthub. ALWAYS do the Maelstom/Mire on the turn he comes into play. It is NEVER worth it to try and fight it out if the opposing magi has more than 20 energy. First it&#39;s not worth it to use up the cards you have been saving for Blygt. Second it&#39;s better to have a magi out with 2 or 3 energy, and no creatures in play, then let them toy with Golthub, and let him linger on the verge of death, while they rebuild their forces. With 3 Maelstom&#39;s in the deck you should always draw one between Baa&#39;s power, the Slarnath&#39;s power, the Treepsh&#39;s power, and the Moss Quido&#39;s power. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Blygt: As you might have gathered Blygt is the powerhouse of the deck. As you also might have realized, he has to defeat two magi. I will tell you right now he IS capable of such a feat, and I do so regularly. Blygt essentially starts with 2 Moobs (Golthub&#39;s and his own). He also starts with a Moss Quido, and Swamp Weebo. On the first use Waking Dreams, to take some guys out of your discard pile. Then drop as many guys as you can from your hand, even if you will have no energy on Blygt once you are done with your play creatures step. I usually get out about 10 or 11 creatures including the creatures I get from Waking Dreams.  It&#39;s simple to play this many when many of the creatures only cost one, and the most expensive creatures only costing 3 (the least being zero! I love Green Stuff). <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
During your second S/P/R phase I would use the power on both of the Moob&#39;s to gain about 18 energy on Blygt. I usually have third by this point, and I sometimes use his power as well depending on the sitution. After this I usually play a Moss Pendant, and use Decay, or I will play a Frenzy. By the end of this turn most of your creatures will have at least 5 between the Moss Pendant, the Ooze Arboll(s), and Frenzy. I usually have a Jile so they also energize every turn. On subsequent turns, use Waking Dreams to pull creatures that you need out of your discard. I usually try to get a Moob every turn to add some more energy to my magi. Muck Vinoc is a good choice against bigger creatures. As you can see Blygt sets up pretty much on the first turn, does so with plenty of energy remaining on himself. If they are playing with Wessig, I don&#39;t play as many creatures, just enough to get the job done. I&#39;ll talk about the Kazm followed by Wessig and T&#39;Lok situation, and how it might seem like a big problem for this deck later, but I&#39;ll tell you right now, it&#39;s really not a problem. With the diversity of the powers on the creatures in this deck, you are ready for anything. Muck Vinoc&#39;s kill big creatures. You have enough creautures to match, and beat any other swarm decks, as well as any other creature beatdown deck. Even if they have a Kybar&#39;s Teeth deck that has huge guys, all immune to discard, the Yog&#39;s Maul, and the Ainjer provide an easy solution. With the Moob&#39;s power, it isn&#39;t difficult to withstand a Cataclysm. There is realy very little that can stop this deck in my opinion. If you foresee some mass energy removal cards, just play a couple Treepsh&#39;s or pull some with Waking Dreams. If somehow they are making you discard your hand, the Moss Quido let&#39;s you draw an insane amount of cards. Blygt is truly of capable of defeating two magi, and most of the time does it very easily. Often times I defeat their second magi with about 6 creatures in play. By this time I have one of two Darkness&#39;s, and unless they play more than 6 they will usually lose their third magi, the turn he comes into play.<br>

That should be all you need to know about how to play with Blygt. Now on to some combos/card explanations. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Waking Dreams:<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
This section of my strat will focus on the art of choosing creatures with Waking Dreams. My first choice in almost every situation is a Moob. I love this power because it allows you to react to any situation. If they have a large creature in play, you realize may be difficult to kill just pull a Muck Vinoc. Keep in mind that the have the choice of which of the 3 creatures will return to the discard. Who cares though right? If you want that Muck Vinoc, just take the Bolobog, and the Swamp Weebo. I know I would rather have only one of my creatures die instead of all of them, or most of them. Or you can take the Muck Vinoc, and a Moob and a Moss Quido. They might pick the Muck Vinoc, thus saving that creature, but at what cost? Blygt just gained 8 energy, and drew 7 cards. I&#39;m just using the Muck Vinoc as an example. You can usually make it a lose-lose situation for your opponent as far as which creatures you get out of Waking Dreams. For those of you who don&#39;t know what the Bolobog/Swamp Weebo combo is I&#39;ll explain. Devitalize is a  very mean power that removes A LOT of energy if you have a lot of creatures out, which you should. The downside is, it costs 5 energy, and the Swamp Weebo only starts with 2. The Bolobog provides the Swamp Weebo with enough energy to pull of this combo. Obviously, a Bolobog isn&#39;t the only way to get energy on the Swamp Weebo, but they are great to pull out of the discard together. Another reason I love Waking Dreams, is because it allows you to get creatures out before the attack step. Although these creatures can&#39;t attack, many of the powers on my creatures are only usable before the attack step, including the Bolobog, Ainjer, and Moss Quido. It also allows makes powers such as the Moob&#39;s and the Ainjer&#39;s more effective since it&#39;s 2 more creatures.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Anyway, just play smart, and take whatever cards you need to win. Use the sucker ploy to make your opponent choose the more obvious creatures to discard such as the Muck Vinoc, in order to get something you really need, like a Treepsh or a Moob.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
I was going to do a card explanation section but I decided not to since, this strategy is getting pretty lengthy as it is. One or two things. Kazm is NOT a problem for this deck. I have defeated decks starting with Kazm, and Wessig second time and time again. If you don&#39;t believe, just look at the tournament report I wrote. I also have survived a Harror w/ Catalysm, and Dark Ayebaw. Again, not a problem. Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions please D-mail me and ask about it first before you go giving poor reviews, because I know this deck looks pretty risky at first glance. Thanks again. If you are just interested in how to play the deck, you&#39;re done reading. Following this, are just a couple responsed to reviews I&#39;ve received. Thanks for reading!<br>

Deuce 86&#39;s Review: Great Throne Mushrooms, are great for a deck such as this where creatures are suiciding often but there just isn&#39;t enough room. The only thing I could possibly take out would be the Yog&#39;s Maul but, they are too essential in some circumstances. Also I would pull 2 Moob&#39;s and an Ainjer with Waking Dreams if I could, unfortunately Waking Dreams allows you to pull 3 <i>different</i> creatures.<br>

Silver Night&#39;s Review: With 3 Maelstroms in the deck it isn&#39;t uncommon for me to draw a Maelstrom on the first turn. I have played some very powerful decks, and I usually get at least 2 turns out of Baa, which is usually plenty. Also in most of my experiences many players I know, unless they are expecting Cataclysm,(which they won&#39;t be) their first goal isn&#39;t to mass energy on their magi. Often times they try to get creature domination on the board. Finally, Climbing Staff does present, an obvious problem, but I&#39;d like to share an interesting story. I was playing a Kybar&#39;s Teeth deck that started with Kazm. Kazm killed Baa with 5E. left on his magi (note: He Did Not try to mass energy on his magi) Anyway, I flip Golthub, and pay 5 for a maelstrom, and he drops a climbing staff. He smirked, thinking he had foiled my plan. It quickly dissappeared when I simply played another one. I&#39;m not saying this will always happen but it could. Also I&#39;d like to point out, as I have a THOUSAND TIMES. Killing all of your opponents creatures, and taking 20 energy of his magi is usually enough for Blygt. On the rare occasion that Golthub failed to kill the magi, Blygt still managed to win due to the fact that Golthub weakened the magi to the point of an easy defeat. <br>

Response to Ring&#39;s Review: That&#39;s what the Treepsh&#39;s are for. <br>

Response to HccDespoiler&#39;s Review: I have never seen a deck that starts with Sorreah, they usually start with Delia if they&#39;re smart. If they have Sorreah second, which they usually will, Golthub kills Delia. Sorreah comes out, and does nothing, since my magi is still face down. I play some guys, making sure not to overcommit since duh, it&#39;s Sorreah, is he ever going to anything BUT cataclysm. I end the turn with a couple of creatures out, and a lot of energy on my magi b/c of Moobs. Sorreah poses very little threat to this deck, as does any other similar magi such as Harror.<br>
