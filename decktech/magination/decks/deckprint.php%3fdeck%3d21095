39 cards (also explained below.)   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I saw Derek had posted a version of the deck. Very, very infant version of the broken Blue deck. There&#39;s been a version dominating the local scene here for over a month now. Nobody on the lists will listen to how bad the deck is. It&#39;s been tweaked far more than Derek&#39;s version, and is extremely stable. However, it&#39;s auto loss is to Chur in your opponents first Magi slot. Nothing can be done about it.<br>
<br>
Derek&#39;s version is flooded with a lot of unrequired cards. His posted Magi order is very weak as well. There is no reason not to run Aula first, and Blue second, followed up by Quilla to finish in case somehow your opponent manages to defeat Blu. I&#39;ll explain after you read my deck listing.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s the version I run. (read the deck listing.)<br>
First, you will notice the lack of spells. Spells bog down the deck. You&#39;ll recycle so often that you&#39;ll only need one copy of the Entangle, Will, and Thunderquake (which is mainly for an Aula suicide mechanism.)<br>
<br>
Second, the single copies of most relics. By playing single copies, you have more relics in play for weggit, and to cycle through the deck with Blu when searching for a specific card. <br>
<br>
Third, the single copies of all the creatures except Weggit. You&#39;ll never need multiple Pylofuf&#39;s. If you dont have one, its easy to dream channel another creature, even your opponents if you need to Flood of Energy. You can recycle them easily. J&#39;lith is in the deck for match ups against the Dark Twins. Play the J&#39;lith with no relics in play to break the corrupt for 2 energy. Also, the J&#39;lith dies since you resolved effects first on your turn. You lose 2 energy to break their corrupt.<br>
<br>
Fourth, my choice of Magi. Aula is a drawing machine. The goal is to Cycle as many cards as you can your first turn and suicide her to go to Blu asap. Play the Scepter, and any relics you get in your opening hand. Windsight the J&#39;lith and any other relics you can&#39;t play, and any spells. Look for a Mirror Pendant or Weggit. Play any of the two you have. Windsight again with the Pendant if you got it, or discard the weggit for more cards. Try to play another Weggit with boots to draw more cards, or suicide if you can&#39;t. <br>
<br>
Next turn, reveal Blu. Look for another Weggit, Dream Channels, and Floods of Energy. Flood yourself as high as you can go, and Entangle/Will your oponent before you cycle your deck if you can. Recycle the deck, and flood more. Replay Entangle/Will if your oponent Climbing Staff&#39;d either the first time you played them. Your optimal choice for the Dream Channels is the Pylofuf, but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way. Try to put them on a Weggit if you can&#39;t attach them to a &#39;Fuf, and just recycle them after you Flood.<br>
<br>
Use any useful relics you can. Play the Baloo Roots and cycle them to prevent Turns or Rayje&#39;s sword/cloak/belt from killing your &#39;Fuf.<br>
<br>
Use the Relic Mirror to protect valuable relics like Barqua&#39;s Bubble and Rayje&#39;s Belt. <br>
<br>
Will of Orothe and Flood every turn. Using the Hubdra&#39;s Spear to keep your opponent&#39;s Magi in check.<br>
<br>
Use Karak Necklace in case your opponent corrupts you the turn Aula dies, and draw 2 cards. Use the Hubdra&#39;s Cube to steal a crucial relic in the mirror matchup. It also pairs well with the Karak Necklace.<br>
<br>
Use the Will to have your opponents creatures crash into the &#39;fuf, or the Ormagon to blow them up. <br>
<br>
Almost always name &quot;Weave&quot; with the staff oes. You&#39;ll be playing a weggit every turn to cycle your deck, and it will save you energy.<br>
<br>
Quilla is the best 3rd Magi in my opinion. The 2 times I&#39;ve had Blu die, she&#39;s finished the game for me. The 2 Orothe relics fits the deck style well, as well as her high energize rate. The 2 relics she gets can help you set up again, with the help of a Weggit. Take the Cube and a Karak Necklace if your opponent has a relic. Draw 2 cards. Play Weggit, and draw more cards. Start the loop/lock all over again. This late in the game you will have weggits and usually a few relics left that you didn&#39;t play before. It&#39;s not neccessary to play every relic from your hand on Blu if things look bad, save them for Quilla because she can hold her own with a little fuel. <br>
<br>
Also, I don&#39;t know how widely used it is everywhere else, but Climbing Staff is a necessity for the deck. When it came out, I noticed that anyone could use the effect of discarding it to prevent a discard or power/spell/effect from hurting your magi. I used it in Orothe control, and until other people caught on, I dominated mirror match ups. I could spear them, but they couldn&#39;t spear me. Now, they are played in almost every deck locally as a counter to maelstrom/spear/implode/etc. <br>
<br>
You will also notice this is only a 39 card deck. I&#39;ve been experimenting with the last card. I&#39;ve tried Um No..., Beam of Light, Abraxin&#39;s Crown, and Storm of Fishes. Any one of these is a solid choice. However, I&#39;ve hardly ever used any of these cards, they are merely safties for the deck. Pick one that you prefer. Um No... for scenes with a lot of Arderial players. Abraxin&#39;s Crown for discard, or mirror match ups against versions with Storm of Fishes or Orothe control. Beam of Light for a high concentration of players using Shadow Cloaks (multiple copies) in their Core decks. And Storm of Fishes if you want another (risky) safety against spells if your environment has a lot of players using Climbing staffs as protection. Choose one that fits your style, and you now have a 40 card deck.<br>

-Learn the deck and dominate your local scene so maybe someone will do something about the reoccuring decks that abuse relics and lock out your opponent. It&#39;s getting old.-<br>
