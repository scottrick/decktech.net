What I will attempt to show is a brief way the deck starts off and what are some of the things you need to watch for.<br>
<br>
Arawan comes up first.  Use his ability of Warp Driven to pull your 3 Fog Hyrens right away.  You want to use these guys to really start cycling your deck and getting the cards you need NOW, not later.  Most people would gasp at the idea of having to discard one of the 2 cards you draw, but it has yet to hurt.  Getting the cards I need to win is more important than discarding cards I &quot;could&quot; use later.<br>
<br>
The deck really shines when you have a lot of creatures out and you play Liriel&#39;s Cape.  The added advantage to this is when you have a Bagala Fangs in play, and you go to up to 13 energy with one creature by using the Fangs power of Power-Ups.  The Fangs work really nice with annoying creatures that a starting to grow.  Use Power-Ups to set their starting energy to 10 and then play the Ambust spell.<br>
<br>
The deck rarely drops to the second magi, Yricho.  When it does, abuse his effect Athletic to do a many of different things.  Fang another creature, use Rajye&#39;s Belt again, use a creature power, etc.  It is a lot of fun to do.<br>
<br>
Kioko is currently the deck finisher.  Her powers go hand in hand with Bagala Fangs.  Not to mention she starts with them!<br>
<br>
Most of the other cards in the deck are pretty self-explanatory and strategies for handling deck arch-types have been explained so much I think for this deck I will pass on posting them again.  Enjoy! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
