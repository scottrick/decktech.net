Credits go to CJ Damelio, who gave me this idea with his &quot;Naroom Oddball&quot; deck. <br>
   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First of all, I do not want to see people giving me less than 4 stars for this deck simply for the reason that it&#39;s 2 cards above the suggested amount. With Evu and Chayla&#39;s card draw, you will not even notice the difference.<br>
<br>
I think that 2 of the 3 magi are self explanatory, but I will walk you through them again:<br>
<br>
Evu- Evu is in the deck to draw me a bunch of cards to set up Chayla. No more, no less. I also considered Tiller for a starter, but he does not pack enough punch without his Forest Hyren/Weebo combo, which I did not want to run in this deck. He does draw cards faster, however, but Evu draws more consistently, which makes him a better choice in my Eyes. Defend Evu for as long as you can, but do not go all out with playing creatures just to keep him alive one more turn. It will not be worth it in the long run.<br>
<br>
Chayla- Chayla is one of the promos for the Naroom season of the MN league, and she packs quite a punch with her little furry friends. Her Eebit pack is pretty overwhelming once it gets rolling, and with her built in card draw when she plays them she can cycle through the deck even faster than other magi. Remember to apply her effects every turn, because they give your Eebits an energize rate of 1, which will come into the big picture a little later in this guide.<br>
<br>
Eidon- Eidon is the apotheosis (look that word up, it makes perfect sense in this context) of a swarm magi. His effect Familiarity is pretty abusive with creatures such as Eebits and Rabbages. You will be able to play most of your little furry friends, and still have quite a large amount of energy on him. His 6 energize makes him a quite stable magi to play in the back slot as well.<br>
<br>
Now, I will go through the general strategy of this deck. I will go through it on a magi to magi basis, starting with Evu.<br>
<br>
Evu is in the deck just to draw cards. Don&#39;t feel obligated to keep him alive for a too long time, however, because you wanna save your creatures for your next 2 magi.<br>
Once you get to Chyala, you should have a Robe of Vines in hand. This card will be VERY useful in this deck, since the major part of your creatures are small.....at first. Play the Robe of Vines, then play all your Eebits and/or Rabbages if you want. They will all gain one extra energy  from the Robe, and they will all have an energize of at least 1. This is where the Elder Weebo and Furok Guardian come in. Play all your little buggers, drop the Guardian and the Elder weebo and let the energize fun start. Use the Weebo&#39;s vitaminize effect, to give all your creatures an energize of 2 or to increase all your creatures energize rates by 2. He will leave play because he is required to discard himself, this is where you use the Furok Guardian&#39;s effect Terra Rebirt. When the weebo kicks the bucked, bring him back into play with the effect. Then, on your 2nd P/S/R step, play Flood of Energy, and Voila, you have tons and tons of free energy on the board for way less than you actually paid for with Chyala. <br>
NOTE: This Combo may be hard to pull off on the same turn that Chyala hits play, so be rational and evaluate the opposing board before doing all of this. If you just defeated the opposing magi, go for it. Do not worry about a thing unless they play Arderial. A cataclysm at the wrong time could really mess this deck up, but then again, thats the case for many decks. With all that free energy you gained in 1 turn, you shoud be set for taking control of the offense in the game. Use Orwin&#39;s Gaze to reclaim your Flood of Energy and/or Elder Weebo. Be hesitant with the Weebos, however. They can be brought back by the Guardians much easier, so it&#39;s important to be able to judge whether or not to take the Weebo at any given point in time.<br>
Once Chayla dies, Eidon is a very solid back up magi who can easily pick up the pieces of the opponent or continute the fight accordingly. Use the same strategy as above, only this time it could go one of 2 ways:<br>
1) You have all the cards you need and are set to play all your little weenies and save a bunch of energy doing so.<br>
2) You only have a part of the combo or can not pull it off due to a lack of energy.<br>
Things that affect the outcome of that situation are certainly the content of your hand. If youre holding 2-3 of either the Eebit and/or the Rabbage, a Flood of Energy, an Elder Weebo, and a Furok Guardian are the cards that you want in your hand in order for this to go the easy way. A Robe of Vines helps too, by the way. If you have all that stuff in your hand, play it and start the cycle over again. Only this time it could be slightly harder to do it more than once beacause you may have played both your Orwin&#39;s Gaze to reclaim your Floods. If you have, play the combo once and keep up the offense from there.<br>
Thats the strategy for this deck. It may seem complicated in theory, but in practise its much easier to play than it looks. Below, I will explain cards that I have not mentioned in the article above.<br>
<br>
Wasperine: Solid creature that is always worth putting in Naroom decks. They make up for the lack of Warrior&#39;s Boots, which I felt I did not need in this deck.<br>
<br>
Rudwot: Solid beatdown creature, and it helps you get rid of opposing annoying stuff while most likely making itself more powerful in the process.<br>
<br>
Furok: They are a very solid creature in general, and I feel that at least 2 belong in 95% of Naroom decks due to their overall versatility. If you can pump these guys up by using your other cards, they will be able to almost pay for themselves with their effect.<br>
<br>
Weebo: In the deck mainly to restore wounded Furok Guardians back to their huge 10 energy starting, which helps you keep your stuff alive way longer.<br>
<br>
Energy Band: Cheap, solid, and reliable creature pump. What else do I need to say besides the fact that I love this card.<br>
<br>
Yaki&#39;s Gauntlets: You can use this little friend here to let your creatures attack twice when you feel the need to, which takes the guess-work out of your opponents turn. If you are able to take him out, you dont need to worry about what he&#39;s gonna do next with that mean effect on his magi. Am I correct? Of course I am.<br>
<br>
Vortex of Knowledge, Plith, & Forest Jile: Starting cards for Evu and Eidon. They can be pretty useful too, especially the plith which helps keep little old Evu alive longer.<br>
<br>
Crushing Roots: This one is used maily to take out threats that are ever growing. In other words, if your opponent has one favorite creature which he keeps pumping constanly, hit it with one of these handy cards. You can either hit it once to bring it down into your range, or just kill it right there go gain some free energy. If he doesnt have a creature he pumps constantly, just kill or weaken the creature you are most threatened by.<br>
<br>
NOTE: I would have included a Rayje&#39;s Belt or 2 if I had any, but I dont so I&#39;ll have to do without them. Also, it seems that Rayje&#39;s Shield could work very well here too, with all that card drawing from Evu and Chayla.<br>
<br>
Well thats it. I hope you read my strategy before you rated my deck, because what I&#39;m trying to achieve with this deck may not be apparent at first.<br>
