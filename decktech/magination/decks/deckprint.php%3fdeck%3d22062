Changes from the old deck:<br>
-Magi Order<br>
There are a couple reasons for the change in my magi lineup. First of all I think that Vorga is a more effective magi in the 2nd slot. Also I got rid of Grega because she just has to little energy to perform the kind of things you want to do the second magi is revealed. Her starting is only 10. It just wasn&#39;t enough to keep up with the speed I wanted this deck to move at. I also like Gar in the last slot because of his energy adding power. His energy is also sufficient for this deck design.<br>
-Creatures<br>
While playtesting this deck I realized that the have an Ergar, a Giant Arboll and maybe a few other creatures (a Magma Hyren especially) is very powerful combo. With Scroll of Fire, each time you do &quot;Spark&quot; you are removing 2 energy off an opposing creature, at the cost of 1 off of your own creatures. 1 for 2 is a good deal right? What&#39;s better is, each time you &quot;Spark&quot; you add one energy to the Giant Arboll. You also add one to the Arboll whenever you play a spell. Arboll can also add his energy to any creature of magi in play. <br>
-Spells<br>
At first I though Wildfire was to expensive, but after playtesting I realized I actually had an abundance of energy. It&#39;s actually a very powerful spell if used with a Scroll of Fire.<br>
-Relics<br>
I got rid of some of the pointless relics, such as Gorgle&#39;s Glasses, and Rod of Coals. Instead I added the much more effective Warrior&#39;s Boots. This is supposed to be a fairly quick deck. Warrior&#39;s Boots is great if you have a Giant Arboll and a lot of spells in your hand. Play the Arboll, then play the spells, and add massive energy to the Arboll. Then attack with it!<br>
<br>
Thanks for looking at my deck. Hope you like the modifications I&#39;ve made to it. I&#39;m looking forward to your feedback. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
