I played this deck at my Storyline today, I went 2 and 3 mainly due to the fact that I didn&#39;t have 3 Bog Wellisk and I had to make due with substitutions for them and the Rayje&#39;s Shield.  Well anyways, here goes the strategy.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
With Baa your main focus is to draw Cards, no matter what. First turn, play your hand, which is usually about 90% creatures. Play them, making sure to spend one extra energy to draw the extra card at the end of your turn. If you get a Rayje&#39;s shield, you will be able to help your creatures out a great deal, but make sure to save one for Blygt. Once Baa kicks the bucket, flip Golthub. If you have a Maelstrom in hand, use it to bring the opponent down to zero enrergy and then use mire to defeat all creatures of his region. At this point, you will usually be on your 3rd, and the opponent on his 2nd, but if you managed to knock out one of his guys, the better.<br>
<br><br>
I won both of my games today on Blygt, with the opponent being on his 2nd when i flipped Blygt. He is a power house. When you reveal him, play your hand, make sure to save 3 energy to use waking dreams, by this time your discard should be plenty full with creatures to revive. The ones you usualy want are Moob and Ooze arboll, they helped me out the most, but this is very situational. I also like to pick Zungg out, because they can kill annoying 1 energy creatures while making themselves stronger. After a while, your opponent won&#39;t be able to keep up with your constant revival and energy gain from the Moob and Ooze arboll, and he will fall prey to the Swamp Beings. This deck is a lot like Nick&#39;s, it plays pretty much the same, except I made a few changes to the card set ups, I took out certain ones and put in some cards that I thought are very useful in this kind of deck.<br>
<br><br>
I&#39;ll explain some indvidual cards now:<br>
<br><br>
Maelstrom: Just in the deck to combo with Golthub, I really should only play 1 but I play 2 because it increases my chances of drawing it.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Darkness: What can I say.....the 7 energy is worth it every time, and with Blygt and Moob 7 energy should be no problem. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Rayje&#39;s Shield: Works almost too good with Baa. Good in any deck, so expect to see this guy around soon. As for someone mentioning theyre only used on Baa, you couldnt be more wrong buddy. Theyre madly useful with Moss Quido&#39;s once I get to Blygt, and the energy I net from playing them is worth it every time.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Moss Pendant: Constant Creature Pump, helps a lot later on.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Yog&#39;s Maul: I haven&#39;t used this many times, but when I do use it, my the energy advantage I gained was very much worth it.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Bog Wellisk: A nasty surprise for your opponent. An instant defender and a very cool card all around. It&#39;s the best counter to Warrior&#39;s Boots, and a very helpful card. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Moss Quido: Card drawin en masse...and with Rayje&#39;s Shield energy gain as well.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Moob: Simple word, amazing effects on this deck. He helps me out so much later on, giving me 7 energy and more when I use him. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Green Stuff: Cheap Creature. Mostly used with Baa for a cheap card draw at the end of your turn.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Zungg: These guys are very versatile and useful. Their Gnaw helps you clear the table before an attack, and it can also bring down bigger creatures down to your range.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Ooze Arboll: Very cool card. One of my favorite artworks as well. <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Jile: They kick butt if they can stay in play long enough to provide my guys an energize. They are usually a prime target for attacks, discard, and burn spells.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Treepsh: Actually I was going to take treepsh out, but the cards it lets me draw helped me out a few times, so I kept it in until now.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Slarnath: Card drawing.....what else do I need to say?<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Bolobog: It&#39;s really amazing to see how effective this creature can be. If you have a bunch of little weenies in play, you discard one of these friends....Oh my. They pump one of your creatures way up.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Muck Vinoc: Aaah....my living Shockwaves. If I have one of these in play, the opponent will think twice before playing a huge creature. If he doesn&#39;t, I use him to attack and to defend. Very versatile.<br>
<br><br>
Again, credits to Nick Dowd for making this deck in the first place.<br>

I need some help with this deck. I want to trim it down to 40 cards, and I need some help deciding what to put in/take out. Any help is appreciated.   <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
UPDATE: I have playtested this deck thoroughly by now, and made quite a few changes. I&#39;ve taken in account most of the reviews for it and tried them out accordingly. I will have a new version of it up pretty soon.<br>
<br><br>
Also, this deck even beat a Front-Slot-Kazm ritual spear deck, which im surprised about. By now the deck has gotten really good and powerful, and I&#39;m looking for new things constantly. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
