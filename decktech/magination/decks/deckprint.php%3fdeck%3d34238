Both tests were done on gEngine. I think one of the links from my member page goes to the CCG Workshop were it can be found. Normally, I might try testing this deck more, but I thought I would attempt a little activity on this site. See if anything stirs up. <br />
<br />
However, as for this deck.... <br />
<br />
Ahdar used to be my first magi in Weave for the match up against heavy card draw decks, such as Naroom-Tiller/Orothe-Barls/Arderial. With Taisa failing to make the cut for restricted, I found myself falling back on this old favorite. Starting with an Uwamar in Weave cannot be bad. There are plenty of creatures in here to keep it well fed. <br />
<br />
Kesia made the grade for restricted. I was sort of surprised at that. Then again, so did the Forest Hyren/Weebo combo. With some power energy tricks out there among the regions, you’ll need this Weave favorite. Weave around to gain energy and save on the few Weave spells you can. Combined with her flute, Kesia can really make a strong stand against some otherwise desperate situations. <br />
<br />
Bo’Ahsa might seem like quite a change from all the aggressive Weave I tend to run. If it helps, think of her as great protection for your more aggressive attackers. In the first test game, I redirected an opponents initial attack away from my Seaweed Lascinth. This really saved my hide and managed to win me the game. Since I run an aggro-Weave, saving my best attacker turned things back in my favor. <br />
<br />
As for the basic strategy of the deck, it runs like I normally run Weave. Remove energy from the Uwamar with re-weave, weave, and the flute to place it any of your creatures that can/must attack. Attack repeatedly. Rinse. Repeat. <br />
<br />
Since Aritex didn’t make the cut, I chose to introduce Bungaloo and Sagaweave to move energy around a tad bit faster to where you might need it. You could consider Tresh, but I opted for Sagaweave because you should easily have plenty on an Uwamar that just needs to be moved to where it is more useful. <br />
<br />
As for the two test games, neither opposing deck was restricted. <br />
<br />
The first deck was fairly close to it, I think. Lacking Brushfire or another means of handling creatures outside of attacking with its own, this deck demonstrated its potential in the first game by sparing the Seaweed Lascinth with Bo’Ahsa and turning around with Weave Seed and reflexes to swallow Iceberg Hyrens whole. That is somewhat impressive in itself. In that game all my relics were being stolen away and discarded due to an Orlon’s Ring-Hubdra’s Cube combo. That the deck did alright without the relics was also pleasing. <br />
<br />
For the second test, the deck ended up going against a Pok deck with Rayje’s Shield. I had never faced that before. It made the mad energy gains of Paradwyn insane. Ahdar tried his best, but was severely outmatched. Kesia was making the comeback with her effect upon the weaving of energy. This was still tedious and difficult. However, Rayje’s Belt upon the effect weave ended that. Bo’Ahsa tried for a comeback, but it wasn’t to be. Without the Ahdar combo I used in the past to generate mad energy for Weave, it wasn’t even a fair battle. Fortunately, while Rayje’s Shield made the cut, the belt did not. Nor did Rala or Rala Tail, but I think Rayje’s Belt striking out the effect weave is what really prevented a comeback for this deck. No longer able to stand up to the mad energy gain, it was a down hill battle. <br />
<br />
From my testing, I did learn just how much I wish I had Rayje’s Shield, two or three copies preferred. While playing with a virtual deck it is possible to toss in cards I do not have and test that out, I built and tested this deck based on cards I do have. For example, this is why you see only one Grass Hyren. <br />
<br />
In keeping with most of my other deck postings, here are the rare cards from this deck and possible replacements: <br />
<br />
Kesia — Quirle (Kesia can be key against high energy gain decks) <br />
Grass Hyren — Zassyfur <br />
Lascinth — Zassyfur <br />
Tropical Jumbor — Stumbling Junjertrug <br />
Kesia’s Flute — Tomorrow’s Jewel <br />
Three Leaf Clover — Weave Mat (dropped altogether in edit)<br />
<br />
[edit] I played the deck a little more since I posted it. I found it lacked a little necessary punch. Not sure what to do at first, I began to realize that without the Aritex like I used to use, my magi rarely had any need for protection with Three Leaf Clover. Drop the clover and put in Warrior&#39;s Boots instead. The deck has done much, much better with the boots. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
