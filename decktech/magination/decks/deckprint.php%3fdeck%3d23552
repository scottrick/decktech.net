Funny story real quick: When I was in 5th grade, I made it to the finals for the schools spelling bee. I had to spell one word, and I would&#39;ve won. The work was lightning, and I spelt it just like I did in the deck design above. Boy, I felt like an idiot. Anyway go read the strategy.<br>

The main theme behind this deck is creature beatdown. Shimmer is exceptional at doing this, just be careful about going down to zero. I think this deck could win a couple tournaments, with a couple of "rare" card upgrades. Use Shooting Star, and Storm Shield to add a lot of energy to your creatures. This deck is actually pretty well diversified. Elder Yarks are capable of utterly destroying some Naroom, Weave, or Paradwyn decks, while the Shockwaves provide a response to larger creatures. Ballistic Baldar, can also provide some answer to swarm decks. Have fun, and I hope ya like it.  <br>

Response to Reviews:<br>
<br><br>
A couple people have said, I should put Aula, in the first or second slot. I am considering this change, but at the moment the reasoning for her current placement is pretty much the same as in the "Legendary Wings" deck. Its a good deck, I suggest anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it, go check it out. It&#39;s the best Cataclysm deck I&#39;ve seen to date.<br>
<br>
Also I really like Elder Yark because they are a strong defensive and offensive force. They are really good against Weave and Naroom, and the fact that he has invulnerability makes him pretty useful. His power blankets all of your creatures w/ a defensive force. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
