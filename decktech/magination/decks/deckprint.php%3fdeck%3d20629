<br>
Why, could it be? Indeedorinee, it would be Evu! This sucker&#39;s a great starter (as seen in my other deck) and he&#39;s a blast to play. In fact, you can&#39;t help but love the short stumpy bald guy sometimes. Energize: 4, oh well, a Hinko can save that. Starting: Plith! Plith is a great starter for Evu, basically a free 2 cards if he gets attacked, sweet deal. In any case, Evu is there to help you draw like mad, which is a ton, if you didn&#39;t notice. Quoting from my previous deck: <br>
<br>
Now, when you start with him, you always want to go first and fetch the Plith and the Vortex of Knowledge. Draw up to your 5, use the Vortex and this is where the strategy differs on your opponent. If you know that your opponent stands a strong chance against you, put out your bigger creatures and try to keep Evu with a decent amount of energy (as to keep him alive if all your creatures die). If you think you have a great chance of beating your opponent (and he doesn&#39;t play Underneath), then go all out and play Evu to his max, you&#39;ll get your entire deck into your hand soon if you can survive for long enough. Also, make sure to put out a Robe of Vines as soon as possible as goes the same for an Energy Band if you&#39;re wanting to win with Evu. :P <br>
<br>
/quote <br>
<br>
Anyway, after you start to play Evu, you have to decide whether or not you want to save up a little for Zannah and Wence or just play a lot. I mostly just don&#39;t bother saving up since Wence also draws a ton too. In any case, Evu must die sometime or another, and you flip to Wence. <br>
<br>
2nd Magi: Supah Wence! <br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, what happened to Tryn?&quot; you say, well, I&#39;ve decided to replace her with a longer lasting Magi (with surprise: even more drawing power). Although I know its a bad idea to save a ton of cards up just for Zannah (and get wiped out by a couple of cards), Wence is still just fun to play (especially with his 6 energize.) <br>
<br>
In any case, Wence is actually reduced to a 4 energize if you use his power every turn, so he essentially turns into a Super Tall Evu. Anyway, grab Wence&#39;s starting cards and prepare to stall as much as you can. Wence is here as a nice filler between Evu and Zannah (Tryn is actually fine too, its your choice). Spend the TQs and Shockwaves mostly at this point but save the Boots and a couple of the spells just for Zannah Attack. <br>
<br>
Wence shall die (after some time), and on to the final phase, Zuper Zannah. <br>
<br>
Zannah is the coolest Magi....ever! (With the exception of Poad). Her Power is absolutely terrifying when put together with a Warrior&#39;s Boots or just when staying alive for such a long time. Zannah is actually the stall master when it comes down to it, but doesn&#39;t deserve second slot, she&#39;s the finisher of Naroom now (Eidon&#39;s outta style). Play your largest creatures (especially GCs) and attack with Bootsed and Grown creatures for a fun fun fun time. One nifty little combo I like is to attack with an 8 energy GC, lose no energy, then Stomp right afterwords. Well, not that great of a combo, but with your cards in your hands, tons of combos are possible to pull off, which is why this deck is pretty darn versatile. <br>
<br>
Relics and Spells overview: <br>
<br>
Grow: Starting card and fun to use. Good on Zannah when using on Creatures that won&#39;t lose energy when attacking. <br>
<br>
Vortex of Knowledge: Its a one-use sort of thing, don&#39;t grab it if you don&#39;t go first with Evu, and only use it otherwise if you really need cards. <br>
<br>
Thunderquake: Fun-dee fun fun, best to play with either Wence or Zannah. Fun against other Weenie-hoard decks, etc. <br>
<br>
Shockwave: Same goes for this as with Thunderquake, use sparingly, and only on big creatures. <br>
<br>
Relics: <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Cloak: A newer addition to the decks I&#39;ve been making, since the Belt has been hurt a bit, the Cloak is there to prevent any other Belts from hurting you back, etc. <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Belt: You know about this. :D <br>
<br>
Energy Band: Great 2 energy quick gain, its Pruitt in a bottle (almost). Once again, its really fun to use with Zannah with her Power in mind. <br>
<br>
Robe of Vines: Since Eidon is now gone from the deck, I would recommend using this with Evu (if he goes all out) and with Zannah and to not really bother with Wence. Zannah because she needs all the extra energy she can get to get the most out of her, and Evu because he might want to go and do his own version of Eidon Splooge sometimes. Ya never know. <br>
<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: No need to explain here either. <br>
<br>
Finally, the new DE Creature addition: <br>
<br>
Nodj: This is really fun with Zannah, since you really don&#39;t have to worry about him losing energy since he just gains it right back, so he already has 2 powers protecting him. Play him with Wence otherwise. <br>
