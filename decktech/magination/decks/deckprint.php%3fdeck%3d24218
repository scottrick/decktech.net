It&#39;s a little hard to put together, what with all the rare and promotional cards in it, but I was thinking &quot;I think it&#39;d be lots of fun to actually USE Chayla and make a downright swarm Naroom deck!&quot;<br>
... So I did it.  Since there&#39;s a few promos in this deck that may or may not be in the card list entirely, I&#39;ll run over those real quick. ^^;<br>
<br>
Chayla - Naroom Magi<br>
Starting: 12 Energize: 5<br>
Starting Cards:  Eebit, Rabbage, Gilded Cage<br>
Effect - Companionship:  Once per turn, when you play an Eebit from your hand, draw a card.<br>
Effect - Swarm:  All of your Eebits in play gain &quot;Energize(1).&quot;<br>
Flavor Text:  &quot;The more the merrier.  And the furrier... and the noiser... and the...&quot;  --Poad, Naroom Innkeeper.<br>
<br>
Rabbage - Naroom Dream Creature<br>
Energy:  3<br>
Energize(2)<br>
Flavor:  &quot;My garden!  It&#39;s been rabbaged!&quot; --Gruk<br>
<br>
Bythan&#39;s Gift - Naroom Spell<br>
Cost: 3<br>
If you have a Creature in play, choose any one Creature in play.  Add seven energy to the chosen creature.  Return any one of your creatures in play to your hand, discarding all of that creature&#39;s energy.<br>
Flavor:  &quot;The life energy of the forest courses through our veins.&quot; --Bythan<br>
<br>
Orwin&#39;s Ring - Naroom Relic<br>
Effect - Purity:  At the start of your turn, if all the Spells in your discard pile are Naroom, discard all of your non-Naroom cards from play and add one energy to each of your Creatures in play.<br>
STARTING:  Orwin<br>
Flavor:  &quot;It builds, like his temper.&quot; --Tryn, Daughter of Runes.<br>
<br>
The idea was basically built around using Chayla&#39;s abilities--I got her as a  promo card for joining the League (as I&#39;m sure many of you have as well), and just... didn&#39;t have the cards or thought to match her up.  At the time I had no rabbages or eebits, and she just couldn&#39;t make it on Gilded Cage alone.<br>
<br>
But then I managed to get ahold of 3 eebits and finally finished the Tracker path to get my 2nd Rabbage, so a deck for Chayla was thusly necessitated...if that&#39;s even a word. o.o;;<br>
<br>
ANYWAY, that has nothing to do with the deck itself, just a little background.  Basically, this deck takes 90% of Naroom&#39;s accepted principles (which would be pulling out and creating very, very large creatures and pounding your opponent with them) by having no creatures above 3 starting energy in the entire deck (Except for the Furok, which is one of Salafy&#39;s starting cards.), and focuses mostly on the idea of oh-so-fun Eebits and Rabbages.<br>
<br>
Now that the introductions are over, time to get to real strategy...<br>
<br>
MAGI<br>
Chayla - See Promo Card notes, above.<br>
<br>
Salafy - 10/6<br>
Starting cards:  Fird, Furok, Tap Roots<br>
Effect - Protege:  Once per turn, when you play a Naroom creature, you may search your discard pile for a copy of that Creature and place it in your hand.<br>
<br>
Ohk - 11/5<br>
Starting cards:  Twee, Eebit, Vortex of Knowledge<br>
Power - Mind&#39;s Gift:  Discard any one Creature card from your hand.  Choose any one creature in play.  Add 3 energy to the chosen Creature.<br>
<br>
Reasons for Being:  I had to choose these Magi carefully, as Poad was another very good choice for the deck&#39;s theme and strategy.  But his starting cards are a Leaf Hyren (4), a Balamant Pup (also 4), and something else I can&#39;t  recall at the moment... anyway, I knew that if I was going to put one Balamant Pup in, I&#39;d want to put more in for the Balamant Pup Loop.  I didn&#39;t want to do that, so I chose Salafy and Ohk. <br>
<br>
Chayla&#39;s in there for obvious reasons.  She easily pulls out a Rabbage and an Eebit right off the bat, then draws a card for the Eebit.  If the drawn card is a creature then she gets to play that one too!  It&#39;s nice.  Really. n.n  That and the combo I&#39;ve been wanting to use between her and Flood of Energy, which causes all cards with an energize rate to energize immediately.  In Chayla&#39;s case, this would mean Her, her opponent magi, all of her Rabbages, and all of her Eebits. The problem here is that if you&#39;re up against some Bograth or Paradwyn cards, this can do more harm than good... but it&#39;s still fun to pull of combos like that.<br>
<br>
Salafy is a way of recovering cards you may have lost already.  If you&#39;ve already lost 2 of your 3 Eebits(or anything else you might want), now you can get them back!  She&#39;s a little low on starting energy, but she has a high energize and again is a magi that can draw cards and immediately play them without leaving the Play Creatures step.  Very handy in a swarm deck like this one.<br>
<br>
Ohk was originally Poad... but then I looked at him (at the time in my other Naroom deck), and his starting cards and thought to myself, &quot;Twee and Eebit!? Why&#39;d I put him in THIS deck?!&quot;  That deck had no twees or eebits, being centered around drawing cards and using Mind&#39;s Gift or Vinocs... but that&#39;s not the deck we&#39;re talking about! ^^;;  I chose Ohk as another chance to get at least one Eebit back, and Twees are just a fav creature of mine.  That, and his Mind&#39;s Gift is no big deal when you&#39;re discarding cheap creatures like Weebos and Arbolls and such.<br>
<br>
Other Stuff:<br>
Twee Loop Combo:  With 3 Twees, it&#39;s possible (however unlikely) to manage a Twee Loop, where each Twee dies only to Regrow the previous one.  Sadly, opponents usually know how the Twee works, and use it to your disadvantage--not that it&#39;s easy to do that in a swarm deck. n.n;<br>
<br>
Why Weebos?  Some of you are probably thinking, &quot;What a waste of Weebo!  What&#39;s the point in paying 2 to restore a creature to... Two!?&quot;  Well, that&#39;s not what they&#39;re in this deck for at ALL! =D  Weebos cost 2.  That makes them easy to pull out and ready fodder for creature discards/returns.  Besides, I wanted to use Weeblits as well, which discard any of your Weebos to add 5 to another one of your creatures.  Even better, you can choose to discard an OPPONENT&#39;S Weebo to your benefit.  (I just saw that one, actually. o.o;)<br>
<br>
Flood of Energy:  In case you missed it in Chayla&#39;s Reason for Being, her rampant Energize rates of weebos can help a lot with making Flood of Energy worth playing.  Especially if you have a few rabbages out.  It&#39;s even better if you just PLAYED those eebits/rabbages, or somehow lowered your opponent&#39;s energize rate.  (Nightmare Channels, btw, would remove the usefullness of Orwin&#39;s Ring.  Otherwise, they might be in here just for Flood of Energy--and that there&#39;s only one Flood of Energy in my collection.)<br>
<br>
What a Jip:  I came up with a sadistic combo when I played this deck upon seeing a wondrous opportunity to use my 2-3 jips in play.  When you&#39;ve got more than one Jip, why bother using Grow on one of your creatures?  Use it on an opposing creature and sure, you help your opponent... but EACH of your Jips gains a similar amount of energy!  So, you can &#39;grow&#39; an opponent&#39;s creature for 1-6, and then add that energy to two or three of your own creatures.  Far more advantageous, in my mind.  Especially if the opposing creature you Grow is a weebo that you use a Weeblit on to discard it from play to add 5 to any of your other creatures in play.<br>
<br>
Making the Most of Little Creatures:  Never think, &quot;I must defend my so-and-so and not attack with it!&quot;  Unless that so-and-so is a Tree Hinko.  Especially Eebits. They come back when they die anyway. Twees bring SOMETHING back, and if you worry about killing your little creatures off, how are you going to do any damage? Of course, there are plenty of ways to increase thier size like any good Naroom deck.  Grow, Bythan&#39;s Gift, Mind&#39;s Gift... they&#39;re all in there.<br>
<br>
Basically, this is a Naroom deck that doesn&#39;t have any big creatures because this way you get to use lots of them instead.  My biggest problem in all my Naroom experience is that I just never had enough creatures... now I do.  Besides... it&#39;s different. I like doing stuff that&#39;s different.  Makes it fun.  ;)  Of course, a well-placed opposing Ormagon can really put a damper on the fun, as can a well-made Kybar&#39;s Teeth deck.  In a heartbeat.  So pick your battles carefully or you could end up with a &quot;fun&quot; deck that is anything but.<br>
