   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="h2font"> Strategy</Font></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="bfont"> Magi: The Magi in this deck have one simple purpose. Domination (as you guessed from the title) is the basic idea of the deck. The 3 Magi play different parts of the deck. First off, Gia is the Attack Control Magi. Using 2 Junjertrugs and a Bungaloo, she can easily take instant control of the field and dominate the opponents deck in one shot. Kesia is next because of her ability to manipulate the energy on her creatures.  She is a defense Magi rather than an attack Magi. The same is true with Bo Asha. She requires the opponent to attack more than anything else.  When this occurs, be prepared to explain the way she works, which, for this deck, is a very useful occurrence.<br>
<br>
Gia  Turn 1:<br>
Energize: Skipped (16 Energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 1: Play a Book oes and use Unearth to discard it. Get out a Junjertrug Horn. Use Summon and take a Junjertrug out of your deck. Play a Weave Powder. (15 Energy on Gia)<br>
Attack: Skip<br>
Play Creatures: Play a Bungaloo and a Junjertrug, regardless of what you may have drawn as an opening hand. (6 Energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 2: Skip<br>
Draw: Draw 2 cards.<br>
<br>
Turn 2: <br>
Energize +5 Energy to Gia (11 Energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 1: Use Sculpt and take a Kesias Flute from your deck. Use Summon and take a Junjertrug out of your deck. Discard the Junjertrug with Unearth and take out a Warriors Boots. Use Warpath and bring a Junjertrug into play. Play a Kesias Flute. Use Bend and take one energy from Bungaloo and add 2 to a Junjertrug.  Play a Gias Tome. (3 energy on Gia)<br>
Attack: First, have Bungaloo with the one energy any one of your opponents creatures, so long as it will be defeated (The Bungaloo). Once Bungaloo is defeated, use Flee and add 2 energy to Gia. Bungaloo goes under Gias Tome. Feel free to weave one energy from the Junjertrug you bent to to Bungaloo. Have the Junjertrugs attack. Remember they gain 2 energy before they attack. This should help you defeat at least 2 creatures.  (5 energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 2: Play Bungaloo from under the Tome for a cost of 1 energy. <br>
Draw: Draw 2 cards.<br>
<br>
The above is the first to dominating turns for Gia, if you go first. If you were unlucky with the roll of the die, and your opponent chose for you to go second, this is what you need to do. Do notice, all of the above is considering that you still have a 7 energy Junjertrug horn in play and a 2 Energy Bungaloo. <br>
<br>
Turn 1: <br>
Energize: +5 Energy to Gia (21 energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 1: First, play a Book oes. Use Lore, you have the energy flaunt it. Then, use Unearth and get yourself a Junjertrug Horn. Use the Horn to Summon a Junjertrug. Play a Gias Tome and a Weave Powder. (16 Energy on Gia)<br>
Attack: Skip<br>
Play Creatures: Play a Junjertrug and a Bungaloo.  (7 Energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 2: Nothing<br>
Draw: Draw 2 Cards.<br>
<br>
Turn 2: <br>
Energize: +5 to Gia. (12 Energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 1: Use Summon to get a Junjertrug and Sculpt to get a Kesias Flute. Use Unearth to Discard the Junjertrug Horn and take out a Warriors Boots. Use the Boots to Warpath in a Junjertrug. Use Bend, removing one from Bungaloo and add 2 to a Junjertrug. (4 energy on Gia) <br>
Attack: With the Bungaloo, attack a creature you know will defeat Bungaloo. Feel free to take an energy from the Junjertrug you bent to and one to Bungaloo. Bungaloo goes under the Tome. Junjertrugs attack. Remember the effects of Rage. (6 energy on Gia) <br>
Play Creatures: Play the Bungaloo from under the Tome for 1. (5 energy on Gia)<br>
PSR 2: Skip<br>
Draw: Draw 2 Cards.<br>
<br>
Basically, you want to go first with Gia. You can pull off her dominating trait, but it is harder if you go second. With Gia, try to eliminate the opponent with 3 or 4 full turns with Gia. Using the Junjertrugs and Bungaloo, try to create a giant energy gain using Bungaloo and Gias Tome. It is the only reason it is in there. It also helps to dominate with the Book and Junjertrugs that die during combat. Once the Junjertrug Horn is gone, you must rely on the Tome to replay the Junjertrugs. If, due to straight removal etc. both Junjertrugs wind up in the discard, fell free to Unearth for a second Horn and Re-summon the Junjertrugs. That is basically all Gia is for. If you need to, Unearth for a Relic Stalker or Rayjes Belt to turn off something or destroy an annoying relic. And, just to close off the Gias strategy section, a quote from Marella, Junjertrugs? Well, Gia and me always just called them FUNjertrugs! Hahahaha.<br>
Kesia  With Kesia, you will rely a lot on the opponent attacking you, rather than you attacking the opponent. The ideal first turn for Kesia is as follows:<br>
Energize: +5 to Kesia (19 to Kesia)<br>
PSR 1: Play a Weave Powder and a Kesias Flute. (19 Energy on Kesia)<br>
Attack: Skip<br>
Play Creature: Play an Uwamar. Then a Speag, Quallon, and finish by playing a Grass Hyren. (5 Energy on Kesia)<br>
PSR 2: Use Bend. You have a 9 Uwamar in play, a 2 Speag, a 3 Quallon, and a 6 Grass Hyren. Use Bend for a net gain of 1 energy to Kesia. Remove 1 from Uwamar and 1 from Grass Hyren. Add 2 energy to Speag and 2 energy to Quallon. If an opponent attacked last turn, Sawgrass them. You should end with an 8 Uwamar, 4 Speag, 5 Quallon, and 5 Grass Hyren, with 6 energy on Kesia if you played no Sawgrass, 5 Energy if you used Sawgrass on a Core creature, and 3 energy if you used Sawgrass on a regular creature.<br>
Draw: Draw 2 Cards.<br>
<br>
That is the ideal first turn for Kesia. You would have built up a force that is out of range of being hit with a Lightning spell, and gives all your creatures a deadly status, putting them all in the super dangerous category, making them all threats. On the next turn, try to get a Jumbor into play and Taunt the opponent, making it all so much harder for them to avoid being killed by your mass of Super Awesome Weave Creatures! Now, lets say that you did get the perfect setup with Kesia. <br>
<br>
Turn 1 (Opp): Attacking Kesia<br>
Attack: If they attack with an 8 or less energy creature, they die, no matter whom they attack. Lets process the effects of the attack. First, they chose a defender, lets say Speag. Speag gains 2 energy from its Watch effect. You chose to weave. First, add 1 more energy to Speag for Kesias Wild Growth. It now is a 7 Speag; you weave 2 energy (Using Quallons Rapid Change) to take 2 energy from Uwamar to Speag, making Speag a 9-energy creature. How fun is that. It is even better if they attack a Grass Hyren because of Wily (Or as it is now called, Evade). If they attack again, take the same route.<br>
<br>
That is how Kesia was made to work, especially for this deck. This will Allow Kesia to dominate in the normal pacifist way. <br>
<br>
Bo&#39; asha:<br>
With Bo Asha, be ready to dish out the punishment Over and over, in the same attack step. Here is what you want out on your first attack step with Bo Asha<br>
Basically, get a Quallon, Pody, Jumbor, and Speag into play. If you can, also try to have a Kesias Flute into play on the first turn. Try the same strategy with Bo Asha as you did with Kesia. With Bo Asha, use Taunt and have each of the oppositions creatures attack. When they do, process all the effects, such as Watch and Weave and Weave Tactics. Unfortunately, you can only use Weave Tactics once per attack. So, use it wisely. Have them attack what you want them to attack. In simpler terms, make sure they attack the creature that will produce the best benefits for you. Here is a simple chart of what to do in an attack. Assume the attack involves (for the opponent) a creature with no Attack Modifiers that specifically affect the defenders. <br>
1-5 energy creature attacks:<br>
Activate Watch and add 2 to Speag. Use Rapid Change and Move 2 from Jumbor to Speag with Weave and Rapid Change. Then, activate Weave Tactics. Chose Speag as the new attacker. Speag gains 2 energy via Watch. Use weave and move 2 energy to Quallon. Speag is at 6, the opponent is at 1-5. Speag lives, they go away. Oh yeah! <br>
6-9 energy creature attacks. This works only if Speag is not the original defender.<br>
Activate Watch and add 2 to Speag. Use Rapid Change and Move 2 to Jumbor from Speag with Weave and Rapid Change. Then, activate Weave Tactics. Chose Jumbor as the new attacker. Speag gains 2 energy via Watch. Use weave and move 2 energy to Jumbor from Speag. Jumbor is at 10, the opponent is at 6-9. Jumbor lives lives, they go away. Oh yeah! This works only if Jumbor is not the initial defender.<br>
10-any number energy on a creature. Follow the attack plan for Jumbor and remember that Jumbor will be sacrificed for the good of the team. And just remember, that if they dont die during the attack, you always have a Sawgrass and a Backhand to use on the next turn. OH YEAH!<br>
<br>
The above is why Bo Asha is a dominating pacifist in her own respect. This will allow you to finish off the opponent quite fast. Quite fast <br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Creatures:<br>
The creatures of the deck are centered on the plan of either attack/defense domination. (A- Attack Helping Creature, D- Defense Helping Creature)<br>
Grass Hyren: This is so obviously a key deck component. This card can totally screw with any plan the opponent has, especially with Kesia or Bo Asha as your Magi. With this Wily critter, you can be attacked by a 12 energy creature and survive, providing you have 6 energy or so and the die roll is in your favor. It also has Weave, which is a key of the Bo Asha and Kesia plans. In the right situation, this one creature can foul up the entire plans of an army of creature, possibly losing 0 energy in any attack. It is great when you use Jumbor to taunt the opponents mass of creatures (Tiny swarm of course) and then attack with the Jumbor, play a Grass Hyren and totally devour the opponent. It is a very useful card. (D)<br>
Lascinth: This is another very useful card for the deck. In the right position, it can be devastating due to the Reflexes effect. A nice situation for this mean guy is any attacker really. Say you Lascinth is at 5 energy, and is attacked by a 9 or less energy creature. Lascinth would still survive. And the opponent would be anywhere from defeated to only 4 energy left. This is another card you want to play with Kesia or Bo Asha. Its very useful on the defensive. (D)<br>
Bungaloo: This creature is best used in combination with Gia and her Tome. By attacking with it, letting it be defeated and going under the Tome, you gain 2 instant free energy from Flee, and with Gia, can replay it only for 1. It is a very nice card that will freely remove 2 energy and net Gia a gain of 1 during each turn in which it is defeated, providing the Tome is in play. (A)<br>
Jumbor: If younger siblings took a form, they would be Jumbor. How evil these things are, let me count the ways. This nasty pigdog thing of doom can force the opponents carefully planned force to be reduced to nothing by a well placed Grass Hyren and Lascinth and Kesia or Bo Asha in play. This monster masher will be certain to kink the opponents plans in almost every situation. (D)<br>
Uwamar: This little dude will be a major source of Weaveable energy for Kesia or Bo Asha. When a creature is played, it gains 2. Then, when it is time to Weave, you weave away the free energy and gain enough energy to knock out the opposition, with the use of another creature. It is also a nice little time bomb. If you get this little monster out with Gia and Bungaloo, it is basically total free gaining energy time on your turns. The Time bomb part I referred to is its ability to get very large, very fast, and then having a Rayjes Belt lock down Wait, you have a previously pacifist creature ready to punish some opponents. (D) <br>
Speag: See Uwamar. Only, replace the theory. It can be a time bomb, but is much more effective during attacks. It will gain 2 per attack, giving you not only the ability to Weave, but also some free energy in every which way with Bo Asha or Kesia as the Magi. (D)<br>
Junjertrug: If I have to tell you this creature is for attack, you have never played Weave before. This customer puts a new spin on anger management. This bad dream manages your anger by devouring the opponent. Whenever this lion-ram thing attacks, it gains 2. It also has to attack each turn, if able. Thus making it one really nasty creature. (A)<br>
Quallon: This is a key part for the Defense Magi. With this little gem, you can manipulate energy in a whole new way, and the best part, they are cumulative. If you have 3 of these in play, you can weave 4 energy for each Weave. 2 in play allow 3 energy to switch creatures during each attack, and 1 in play yields 2 energy to be weaved for each attack set. This will make some really nasty combos possible with Kesia and Bo Asha. (D)<br>
Pody: This works in combination with Jumbor. It is a mini Sawgrass like creature. You chose any one creature in play that attacked last turn, remove 1 energy from Pody, and then remove 3 from the creature. This can change the tides oame as much as a well placed Sawgrass. And, if you never attack with it, and it is never attacked, you can remove a total of 12 energy for 1, theoretically. (D)<br>
Yajo: This is definitely an attack helper. Nothing gives me more pleasure than getting one of these into play with a Junjertrug. Using Vitalize on a Junjertrug, it is pretty much that each Junjertrug loses 5 less energy in each attack, as long as it initially survives the attack step. This little angry grass also works well with Lascinth due to the fact that they must attack. It just simply allows you to replenish energy lost, just to keep the Lascinth in prime condition. (A)<br>
Flugg: There is one of these guys in here just to pain the Core players. Sure, this little weed will do virtually nothing against a Non-Core creature, but against a Core creature, in the hands of Kesia or Bo Asha, you have an advantage so great, it is unmatched by almost all other cards in the deck (against Core mind you). This is a metagame decision more than anything, due to the Core in my area. (D)<br>
Aritex: This little bugger is looked down on by most people. I says to them I says, Hey ever had a mass of creatures in play, only to fins yourself wanting more energy to play more Lascinth or Grass Hyren for Bo Asha or Kesia, and that 1 energy useless creature in play is now, well, useless Then nuke it along with the Aritex and restore your Magi. For a small cost of 6 energy, you can gain anywhere from 16-14 energy. Dont ever use this when your Magi is within 5-6 energy of their starting, it is just a total waste. If you can fit it in, play a mass of creatures, leaving you with enough to play the Aritex and a useless creature, then pop your Magi back to starting. (Not really any specific category).<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Spells: There are very few spells in this deck. The spells serve one purpose, to utterly devastate. Basically, I play them to destroy an annoying opponent or level the field, in my direction<br>
Harmony: This is a great spell. In Kesias hands, it is even more dangerous. If your opponent has to many large creatures in play, hit em with a Harmony then play a Lascinth and a Jumbor. Talk about instant massacre As long as the Lascinth survives, they will probably attack the Jumbor first, so when they do, weave to the Lascinth. The Jumbor will go away, but the opponents will weep, especially if they have a lot of creatures in play.<br>
Sawgrass: Ah may old friend Sawgrass. The opponent attacks something and them BAM! Booyah! Its gone in a single sawing cutting destructive card of doom. Basically, it is a really selective shockwave. It is useless against other pacifist creatures, but very useful in Kesias talented hands. This is a very destructive card against attack decks. Very very destructive.<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Relics: The relics in the deck is useful to Gia in so many ways. They also serve a purpose for your other Magi too such as Kesia and Bo Asha. <br>
Book oes: This is fodder. Plain and simple. For this deck, it was made to be discarded. It can be useful once, other than that no. It is fodder for Unearth. Yep. Thats it just fodder. Why is it in here you ask. because it is a guaranteed piece of fodder for Gia on the first turn. <br>
Gia&#39;s Tome: This card is a semi pivotal card for Gia. You can use it to the most of its potential, or you can not worry about it. It works very well with Bungaloo, but it is useless to you (for the most part) if the Bungaloo is discarded from play. It can prove to be very useful though. <br>
Weave Powder: This is a standard weave card. For Kesia, it allows her to fetch a Junjertrug Horn to use her over abundance of energy. Or, it can be used to retake a Flute or a Tome, if it was recycled. <br>
Junjertrug Horn: This is a key part of the deck for Gia. This will allow her to fetch a Junjertrug and continue to use them over and over. It will get a cycle of Junjertrugs at your disposal. It is not necessary, but it is essential on the first turn.<br>
Kesia&#39;s Flute: This is the main changer of energy in the deck. With Kesia and a horde of creatures in play, it is a major source of free energy. It can also change the field a lot, by allowing you to manipulate the energy in every which way. Remove 1, add 2. Remove 1, add 2. Its so simple, Marella could do it!<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: This is a main part of the deck as far as Gia goes. It is very useful to be able to finish off a Magi too. It is a very simple tactic that can make a big difference. It will allow you to get the (And please dont boo me) jump on the opponent. I dont know why Jump is funny or punny, but it is, to me at least. <br>
Relic Stalker: This will destroy any annoying relic. Dont like those jellybeans. BANG theyre gone. Hate the Rayjes Belt turning off Weave, BOOM its gone too! And why? Because it just doesnt like you. It will crush you like the pitiful waste of relic that you are! Muhuhuhuha! <br>
Special Considerations:<br>
Sorreah: Like all decks, Sorreah can be a problem. Try to get a Rayjes Belt into play as fast as you can. Turn off suppress and destroy Sorreah as fast as possible. Be ever vigilant of this fact, and be always ready to combat it. It will allow you to have a fall back plan if this winged bane of the existence. <br>
Mass Removal: There really is nothing you can do to stop this. You just have to be ready for it. Be sure to have a contingency plan if this is to happen. Be sure to make sure that you can survive a Harror assault. If you cant, and your on Bo Asha, hold off on finishing off the opponent until you can. There is really no other way to stop it. Just be sure to have a Warriors Boots tucked away if a cataclysmic event is about to occur<br>
Discard: This will be a minor problem, as long as you play your cards right. Be sure to have everything as dangerous as the next. If you continuously add all you energy to one creature, and it gets shockwaved, stomped, undertowed, or tidal waved, just be sure that it doesnt cause you to be defeated because you have not beefed up any other defensives. <br>
