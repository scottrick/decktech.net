This is the fourth version of this deck, switching a few spells, a few relics, and a creature or two, plus returning to the original magi has made this a great deck for those who look to play Weave.  It also has an expanded and improved strategy section that makes it great reading for those new to the Weave.  As for what makes this deck unique amongst the Weave decks posted in the beginner category so far (to answer Arigomi&#39;s question) is it works, and it works without rares. Every card compliments each other (unlike my previous version-Tweaves and Ahdar/Drowl/Vuryips! What was I thinking?!) and works toward the goal of building a wall from which to strike from.  Now for those who are looking for a deck with &#39;Zing!&#39;  sadly Weave is not that region. The region is built around the foundations of the Weave itself.  "Grow with patience and care and you will have a killer lawn in the end, literally."<br>
<br>
First the background, a friend of mine got into Kybars Teeth in a huge way and in the process got a rather large collection of Weave &#39;stuff&#39; he did not want. So he kindly gave me all his commons and uncommons and here is what I cooked up (with your help). The foundation of a deck should address the 5 D&#39;s of Deck Design: Damage (how you hurt them), Draw (how to get card advantage), Discard (how to keep card advantage), Defense (how to keep them from hurting you), and Disruption (fun ways to ruin their day). <br>
<br>
There are two elements that are key to winning in Magi Nation, Card Advantage and Energy Advantage, and this deck gets both. With Vuryips, Drowls and Ahdar you can build a card advantage. Energy Advantage comes in many forms; Playing weave creatures so the Uwamar gets huge, defensive cards helping the defender (Speags, Zassyfer, Quallion), and the Magis Effects (Quirle especially). <br>
<br>
This is a beginners deck, in that it has no rare cards in it, if you have some Weave rares look at &#39;Taking it to the next level&#39; below. It does rely on some combos, but would be a deck that I would use to hook someone who is big into &#39;strategy games&#39; into Magi-nation. And there are certainly ways to improve upon it (Will of Orothe, Lascinths, Weave Powder, etc. etc.). But for a way to have a pretty solid Weave Deck for nearly free, this one is hard to beat. <br>
<br>
<b>Magi Notes:</b><br>
<br>
<u>Ahdar</u> is used first. He starts with two nice creatures, but since we dont have Lascinths (which are rare) we will have to settle for the Uwamar and get as many critters in hand first. He is solid against the Tiller and Aula Draw engines (which are rampant in this area), and even against the vile Blu Draw machine he can prove to be powerful, drawing as they draw. This should assist the remaining magi and gets the needed combos into your hand to set up the defense and offense of this deck. Do not expect to hold out with Ahdar to the bitter end.  And against non-draw engines he is pretty solid as a first magi, compared to the other uncommon Magi available, he doesn&#39;t cost you cards (Iyori), and has one of the best anchors to a good defense to get the cards you need for your coming magi, the Uwamar.  <br>
<br>
<u>Quirle</u> is our second mage and is the Tryn of the Weave. Like Tryn he is free energy, with the key exception that his power triggers at the Start of EACH players turn, so in a multiplayer match some creatures become massive, especially if you put it on something like a Uwamar. The trick to remember is dont put all your eggs in one basket, spread the energy out, with weave its easy to move it around, so try not to make one big target for a Shockwave or Giant Carrillions Stomp (or, *shudder*, Essence of Naroom). Do get the Tuk Berries, and hopefully by now you have one Juntertrug in hand.  This enables you to choose if your Juntertrug attacks or not by handling its cravings.<br>
<br>
A note about Quirle&#39;s special ability.  <b>Effect - Gift of Life:</b> <i>At the start of each player&#39;s turn, you <u>may</u> choose any one Weave Creature in play. Add one energy to the chosen Creature.</i>  Often times I get the comment of how Quirle can help an opponent, especially if they are a weave playing opponent, and with all the dual cards coming out in Nightmares Dawn he will soon become a loose canon.  But I point to the very key word in his effect "MAY."  The player MAY choose a Weave Creature, they don&#39;t HAVE to choose a Weave Creature if they do not want to.<br>
<br>
<u>Bo´Ahsa</u> is used last. She recieves Sawgrass, Pody, and Quallon to continue the battle. She is to summon a nice team and ensure the main force is safe from harm. With weave Tactics she has the power similar to Will of Orothe, use that to your advantage and if you have the wall of grass (Quallon, Speag, Zassyfer and something else) you can make something small suddenly very huge. In reality this is where the strongest fight and strongest defense will take place, especially if you have held onto the right cards.  This is the risk with a beginner, knowing when to hold them and when to fold...er, use what you got.<br>
<br>
Now Bo&#39;Ahsa does require some good strategy notes and thanks to the feedback a couple of combos have been noted.  As the feedback increases I will edit this section as more of these are noted:<br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa and 2 Speags walk into a bar.... When an opponent attacks a speag, grab 2e for each of them you have out.  Then force them to attack the second speag and poof they get 2e more.  Now if you are truely vile and want to see someone squirm, grab 2 gum-gums, an underneath creature that can slide behind another creature.  If their first attack goes after a its Speag, Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, now your speags heave each gained 8e, if they go Gum-Gum: its Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, (now use her effect), Speag, just remember that gum-gums can only use their effect once to prevent an infinite energy gain with the speags and her effect triggers once per turn, but at your choosing.<br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa and the Wall of Life...Ingredients: 19 energy, 2 Speags (2e), a Quallon(3e), an Uwamar(3e), and a Zassyfer(3e).  Start with Uwamar, add remaining creatures in bowl, spend appropriate amount of energy.  Choose either Pody or Sawgrass to get vengence.  Results: 1e on you and 21e in the field (if you chose Sawgrass), or 2e on you and 26e in the field(if you went Pody and smacked an attacker).   Now when attacked use weave tactics to make it all huge. The way to do that is move the creature to the largest one each turn. So when they attack the first turn move them to the Uwamar, where it picks up 1e for being the defender and 2e weaved to it from the Speags. If the Uwamar can easily defeat the first attacker, weave the energy to the Quallon or Zassyfer as they have no easy way to get energy.  Now to be totally obvious, if somehow you can hold onto TWO Uwamar, Bo&#39;Ahsa becomes the monster she is destined to be.<br>
<br>
"Bow"&#39;Ahsa - With Zaya&#39;s bow in her arsenal you can draw to your wall of death creatures that your opponent would rather not have attack. This is really good if they have but one creature left in a defensive position, you force it to attack instead of giving it a rest. Good with drawing out those Ergars from Cald, or drawing the wounded creatures of your foe to their quick demise. <br>
<br>
<i>"The other Magi"</i>  One comment I get alot is why not use Artyva or Iyori, the other uncommon magi? Well let me answer that question.  As far as Iyori, it is too easy for a new player to get in the bad habit of using her power.  And often times throws away cards that were better kept, as such I do not want to add this magi in to this deck as it relies on holding cards for later use by other magi, especially Bo&#39;ahsa.  Now as far as Artyva goes, her effect can prove to be a major thorn in your side.  In short Artyva is a traitor. Yes, she is, she can cause you more grief than a new player deserves. Her effect can heal opponents creatures if you have none of your own at the end of your turn that need healing. Too often new players will assail a foe with everything they got and in the end may have a wall of fresh creatures while the opponent may have one or two wounded souls in play, and then Artyva heals them!  As such I would not encourage a new player to play Artyva, as it can too easily backfire.<br>
<br>
<b>The Art of Weave (Basketweaving 101): </b><br>
<br>
First, before getting into your creatures in detail they all have (with the exception of the Juntertrug) a neat effect called Weave. This effect allows you to move one energy between a creature that is involved in an attack, with another of your Weave creatures that is not in combat. <br>
<br>
Now lets examine this closely: If your creature is attacking or attacks and has Weave you can use it. You can use it to bring one energy from ANY of your weave creatures to the one in battle to make your creature stronger, or if you are certain that this creature will not survive the attack or the subsequent round, you can Weave the energy to another creature. Where the art of Weave comes is knowing when to "weave away" or "weave to" a creature on an attack and on the defense. We will look at defense first as that is the most critical. <br>
<br>
On the Defense you want to keep your creatures alive for the following round so they can continue to use their effects. When a creature is attacked first resolve any effects from those creatures that help a defender (Speags/Zassyfers/Fluggs if fighting core) then ask yourself two questions: If I weave 1 energy to my creature, will it live or at least assure mutual destruction? If I weave 1 energy away will I make sure another creature survives a subsequent attack or at least avenge this creatures death? The Weave is dependant on keeping that wall of creatures in place and using their supporting powers/effects to gain energy to keep the energy advantage. If you answer yes to either question then that is the suggested move of energy. If you can answer yes to both, then decide what is more important killing your opponents creature now or later. If you can weave 1 energy away and still survive the attack determine if the same creature might be attacked again, those creatures that seem to draw attacks are Podys, Speags, Zassyfers, and Quallons and you might want to leave energy on them even if they could survive the attack and in fact you might even want to weave energy onto them even if they could survive the inital attack. <br>
<br>
Now on the offense. Lead with your weakest that could survive with one energy being weaved off, moving that energy to subsequent attackers or making one big attacker for the final thrust. <br>
<br>
About Juntertrugs-they dont have Weave as an effect on them, but that doesnt mean they cannot take advantage of it, they are after all Weave creatures. If it needs energy to aid in its attack make sure you send a weave creature first that can survive and send the Juntertrug an energy to help in his battle. If you are on the loosing end of a fight and the creature is going to get destroyed you might want to send 1 energy to the Juntertrug who will gladly give retribution for you. <br>
<br>
So there you have it, now lets look at your army in a bit more detail. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Creature Notes:</b> <br>
Uwamar-The great wall of the weave, this small beast can rapidly become the battery for your weave strategy. Build him up, and weave off the juice. Remember the key is not to put all your energy in one basket. <br>
<br>
Speag- Is the defense battery, and since you get to work effects in any order the common strategy is get speag its 2e, weave energy to the defender. Use the Quallon and you can move both energy to the defender, combine that with a Zassyfer and you can essentially put 3e on a defender each time its attacked. See Bo&#39;ahsa for some of her super abuse.<br>
<br>
Vuryip - Is the one of the biggest critter in this deck, with 6e, still he is a great way to get more cards in your hand which is key to setting up the various combos this deck is good for. Have him hit the weaker creatures so you can get as many cards as possible from him, and remember draw cards when his attacks OR is attacked. <br>
<br>
Drowl- Your other big hitter, also comes with the bonus of 2 cards for playing him. <br>
<br>
Juntertrug-Your last big hitter, problem with this brute is it has to attack, that and it doesn&#39;t have weave.  Still each turn it attacks it gets two energy when it initiates the attack.  The solution to handling this Hunger is to feed it Tuk Berries each turn.<br>
<br>
Pody- Vengence is the name of the game for this card. Most player will try to put the smackdown on him before does it to them him so hes a great way to draw attacks off of other cards. If you have placed a Will of Orothe in your deck he becomes the hand of judgement. <br>
<br>
Zassyfer - Combine this creature with a Speag and and players will be facing a 2 to 3e stronger oppponent. <br>
<br>
Bungaloo - Run them up to the biggies or against that annoying Flutter Yup, just make sure you weave one energy away and then reap the benefit of its death. 3 energy for 2 energy spent is not too bad.<br>
<br>
Quallon - If you set up the Wall of Life right you will have a Zassyfer, a Speag, and a Quallon out there with some heavy hitter. And with weave tactics it becomes very deadly. This one will become a target quickly so if the target of the attack can spare energy and survive you might want to weave 1 energy to this critter to keep it around as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Tweaves - well actually there are none in here, but the number one comment I get from reviewers is &#39;Where are the Tweaves?&#39;  The thing is this deck has multiple drawing engines that take the role of the heavy hitters, Vuryips and Drowls.  And the lead Magi, Ahdar, is a drawing machine if the opposing magi is the same.  What this means is there are too many ways to draw a Tweave out of the Draw step to include them in the deck.  So while they are the cool "Surprise!-I have you now!" of the Weave region, I could not justify keeping them when there were too many ways to get them in the wrong place.<br>
<br>
<b>Spell Notes:</b> <br>
Sawgrass- Revenge plain and simple. The Weave equivallent of Shockwave, but not as proactive. <br>
<br>
Sheath - Now I used to have Binding, but while disruptive on the foe it also was disruptive to my plans. As such I have switched to Sheath, combined with Zaya&#39;s Bow it creates a great way to bring their big guys down and down hard, its also a great stalling tactic.  Now previous I mentioned a combination of Beam of Light and Sheath, unfortunately this is not legal.  Reason being is Sheath does not remain in play (unlike Corrupt), and as such cannot be a target for Beam of Light.<br>
<br>
Beams of Light - I was once a huge fan of Relic Stalkers, but after seeing the need to handle small pests to make way for big attacks, the Beam of Light has replaced the relic stalkers of old.<br>
<br>
<b>Relic Notes:</b><br>
Weave Hut - Previously I had Uwamar Beads in here, but noticing that they only protected the magi and not your creatures I realized my mental error.  So I found a great gem in the Weave Hut.  Very very usefull against Cald, and well, lots of other spells and power too.  Now you loose it if your Magi is attacked directly and there are some creatures that do that (Night Hyren and Stagadan being two that come to mind) even if you have creatures in play.<br>
<br>
Zaya&#39;s Bow - Good for finishing off the little and weak and if they live you can force them to attack. <br>
<br>
Tuk Berries - Always try to get these in play and build up your batteries (Speag and Uwamar), as when you use this card you cant attack. Combine this with a Quallon and through the effect of weave you really have 2e to give to any of your attackers. You also will find this super usefull to lockdown your Juntertrugs cravings if you need to give it a moment to rest.<br>
<br>
<b>Play Notes:</b><br>
Whether you go first or second with Ahdar: Take the Uwamar and not the beads, the plan is to get a few creatures and put them in play with the Uwamar so to overcome the energy deficit you get when going first, or give you the energy advantage by going second. <br>
<br>
If you get a Juntertrug before you get tuk berries save it for Quirlle as he gets the Berries to start.<br>
<br>
What the real trick with this deck is saving up the right cards for Bo&#39;Ahsa while putting up a solid fight with the other magi. The cards to hold onto for Bo&#39;Ahsa is Zaya&#39;s Bow, 2 Speags, an Uwamar, and a Zassyfer.  She gets a Quallon as a starting card and a couple of vengence cards (Pody and Sawgrass). <br>
<br>
<b>Meta game:</b><br>
One can say you can never be truely prepared for anything, but looking at the decks you frequently see, you can make some adjustments and still remain in &#39;beginners&#39; category (ie: no rares).<br>
<br>
If facing alot of spell heavy Arderial or Cald decks, switch out the Drowls for Frusks as you will get to draw more cards than the one time with Drowls.<br>
<br>
If facing alot of Core, switch out the Zassyfers for Fluggs.<br>
<br>
<b>Taking it to the next level:</b><br>
If you have the rares here are some suggestions. <br>
I would swap out a Bow for a Weave Powder (Its a starting card for ALL Weave Magi-use it to fetch whatever relics you need to get.)<br>
<br>
Drop the Drowls for Lascinths (If you have the Lascinths, definately take one when you get Ahdar, makes those who are brave enough to attack, pay for their mistake.  Sadly none of your cards (not even the Tuk Berry) can keep it from attacking, but then you can use the Tuk Berry to make it strong and it can attack, one choice is to keep it in hand until you get Quirle)<br>
<br>
Drop the Podys for Grass Hyren (DE-FENCE er FENSE-enough said)<br>
<br>
Drop the remaining bows for a pair of Rayjes Belts (nothing ruins a persons day when you turn off a Uwamars wait and he suddenly has to contend with a 20e critter) <br>
<br>
Drop the Sheaths for Will of Orothe (With this spell your deck becomes very very abusive.  Combined with Bo&#39;Ahsa and its fatal-for them.)<br>
<br>
Drop 2 Berries for two Gia Tomes (This really improves your ability to keep key cards in play-combined with Bungaloos and you can keep cycling them out, its the eebit of the Weave.)      <br>
<br>
Drop the Zassyfers for Heppeswips. (One of the greatest weaknesses of weave is mass removal, which comes from Core Grags, Xyx Elders, and Ormagons, plus assorted Cald things.  The Heppeswip cannot prevent that from happening, but can punish those who dare use it and would normally live, plus I cannot count the number of times opposing players have psyched themselved out from playing such creatures thinking it would fail.)  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
