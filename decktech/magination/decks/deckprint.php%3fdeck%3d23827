posted here and could benefit more from peoples opinions on the deck.  Now <br>
for the strategy part, I will break down the deck and explain why I think that the<br>
cards that I use work well in this deck.  The Magi:  I mainly use The Dark Twins <br>
to try and swarm the opponent.  They have an insane amount of energy and<br>
energize for seven.  You automatically start (unless your opponent uses them <br>
as well) and start with seven cards.  You get Entomb as a starting card, and I <br>
feel that this can be big.  Usually you tailor the other two starting cards against<br>
the deck you are playing.  Wudge against swarm, Szalak against almost <br>
everything else, and Turn against Kybar&#39;s or other big creature decks, and <br>
Vaporize against relic heavy Orothe, Cald, and Arderial decks.  Turns are a big<br>
part of the deck and the Twins have the energy to make them effective.  The <br>
cards that work well with Turn:  Dark Ayebaw, Core Grag, Zungg, Koil, attacking <br>
with beefy Szalaks or Wudges.  Dark Ayebaw&#39;s and Core Grags can also be <br>
useful for that extra little push needed sometimes to finish off a magi.  Uggers <br>
are best used in conjunction with the Szalak&#39;s but can also work well with <br>
Wudges, Zunggs, or Turned Creatures.  Shadow Vinocs are useful because from<br>
personal observation alot of decks around here use alot of relics, best used <br>
when followed up by a Vaporize.  Wudge is a one energy investment and gains <br>
free energy, Szalak is a four energy investment and has the potential to gain <br>
obscene amounts of energy.  I have heard the comments that Szalak&#39;s are not <br>
that good, but I think that they can be.  If you get two good rolls out of a <br>
Szalak it has more than paid for itself.  Normally there is a 67% chance to get <br>
free energy, this increases to 86% when Loaded Dice are on the table.  Koils can<br>
be nice not only in conjunction with Turn but also for the deck recycle ability to <br>
get your Turns, Vaporizes, and Entombs back.  Climbing Staffs are nice against <br>
Cald and against decks that employ Core hosers like Athiks and Hunter Jiles.  <br>
The Tomes of the Great Library is nice against many decks that use spells, also <br>
useful in getting your spells out of your deck.  Shadow Cloaks are creature <br>
protection and need no explanation.  Loaded Dice are Szalak insurance.  <br>
Warrada&#39;s Ring and Secrets of the Book are nice for the card drawing ability, but<br>
also have their alternate uses.  The enegy reduction ability on the ring is nice<br>
when low on energy or when you already have alot of cards in hand.  The <br>
Secrets can also be useful for seeing what is in thier hand to Entomb.  The <br>
Entomb is simply amazing, and if I had more I would play them.  Great <br>
protection against Cleanse and Cald burn, as well as direct creature removal<br>
spells, and Shell.  The Dream Rift is in there for card drawing, but I have been<br>
thinking of removing it.  Turn is useful for taking control of thier key creatures.<br>
Equilibrate is in there for getting around decks that use creatures that gain free<br>
energy.  Good to use against Xyx&#39;s, Wudges, Szalaks, and Paradwyn decks in <br>
general just to name a few.  You have to use this card intelligently though, as it<br>
can hurt your deck as well as others.  Well that is all so let me know what you <br>
think.  Opinions can either be posted here or sent to my e-mail at:<br>
