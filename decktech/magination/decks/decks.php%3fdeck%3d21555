Yes, I deleted a review.  Though I did not think the review was unreasonable, I just did not entirely agree with the three star rating, and I had enough tech points to do it.  So that no one is suspicious of this, I have decided to copy and paste the review in its entirity and explain why I disagree.<br>
<br>
                                     <i> gotta love the theme! being one of the originators of this strategy<br>
                                      (desolation angel) and having mastered its many combos, i can<br>
                                      appreciate what u&#39;re trying to do. however, my experience has<br>
                                      definitely taught me a lot of things... <br>
                                      as u noted in ur strategy, the tactic is certainly not foolproof. in order<br>
                                      to pull it off...u really have to trade magi for magi w/o giving them the<br>
                                      slightest chance for recovery, which means that suicide is an extremely<br>
                                      important part of the strategy. if u manage to discard their creatures,<br>
                                      but fail to kill them in the process, a skilled player will stall for as long<br>
                                      as need be in order to gain the upper hand once again. this is also<br>
                                      likely to happen w/ their new magi as well. anyone can survive a<br>
                                      cataclysm given enough time. so there don&#39;t appear to be too many<br>
                                      suicidal tactics within the deck w/ the lack of warrior&#39;s boots and<br>
                                      thunderquakes. also, in order for harror to really be effective, she<br>
                                      needs ammunition for the ayebaws. if ur aiming for speed kills, u<br>
                                      certainly rn&#39;t giving urself enough time to build that amunition or even<br>
                                      enough time to draw that crucial agram&#39;s staff should u fall short of<br>
                                      defeating their magi. a mantle of shadows is also a consideration given<br>
                                      the handicap of an entomb. i certainly admire u for incorporating harror<br>
                                      into an arderial deck...however, i feel the novelty will be shortlived and<br>
                                      in reality she&#39;s a bit oamble to be really effective in a pure arderial<br>
                                      deck. my suggestion would be to replace her w/ aula. i love the<br>
                                      concept tho and ur improvements r definitely showing...i look forward<br>
                                      to the next revision!:)</i><br>
<br>
Now- Suicide IS a major part of the strategy, yes.  If I manage to discard creatures but fail to kill a magi?  Um, that won&#39;t happen, because I won&#39;t kill off their creatures UNLESS I can kill their magi.  Therefore, that part of the review seems to be more of a critique on HOW to play the deck, and not the deck itself.  He also says: There don&#39;t appear to be enough suicidal tactics without Thunderquake or Warrior&#39;s Boots.  Hmm.. I want to know how either of those would help this deck?  Cataclysm would cause me to discard Warrior&#39;s Boots from my hand, so it is no help, and Cataclysm destroys all creatures anyway, so Thunderquake is no help.  As for suicide, Sorreah can follow Cataclysm with Dark Ayebaw or Xyx, and the strategy already explains how Harror and Kalius kill post-cataclysm.  If you can&#39;t get the one turn kill with Sorreah, you don&#39;t have to!!!!  Now, Harror doesn&#39;t have enough time to get ammunition?  Considering she barely needs any.... If you even have three cards in your hand when you flip Harror over you can kill any magi with 6 or less energy.  Just three!  And since you only use one of Kalius&#39; three starting cards, that means you only need to draw ONE card to give Harror the ammunition she needs.  And as for not having enough time to draw the staff?  If I need the staff, I use Kalius starting Warlum to get it, as I&#39;ll know if I need the staff before Harror is flipped over.  A shortlived Novelty?  Replace with Aula?  Does Aula start with all the tools she needs for a one turn kill EVERY time?  Harror does.  Sure, this may seem like a lot of stuff to remember, but that&#39;s why this is an advanced deck- it&#39;s not easy when you first pick it up, but it has all the tools to consistently win against most everything in the current environment.</font><br>

<br>
<b>For those of you who looked at the first deck and saw certain problems with it, the following four paragraphs are for you.  If you didn&#39;t see the first deck at all, just skip the first four paragraphs and go to the regular strategy</b><br>
<br>
*******After posting the first deck, I realized from the reviews that Aula was inconsistent, risky, and too vital to the strategy for the deck to be a regular winner.  Then I thought to myself: What would enable me to consistently get the parts of my deck without adding too much?<br>
<br>
Sorreah.  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of it before.  He goes second, grabs two Cataclysms (one of which will be saved for Kalius) and still has Suppress with which to overpower the first magi.  To compensate for putting Sorreah first, I made the creature to spell/relic ratio VERY high as to ensure no starting hand is without creatures.<br>
<br>
I then realized another thing.  Ayebaw isn&#39;t the only card that combos well with a one turn attack from Kalius.  Because Kalius starts with shooting star, an Xyx can go up to 4 energy, attack, then Shock the magi all for 2 energy.  As with a Nighthyren, who can gain two from Shooting Star, two from its own ability, and another possible two from Storm Ring.   So you see, since Sorreah starts with Kalius&#39; Cataclysm and many of the cards combo well with Kalius, Sorreah isn&#39;t required to draw anything!<br>
<br>
Also, Law pointed out to me that another thing to make the deck stronger would be subthemes in case Cataclysm falls through.  Read on through the strat to find out what those sub-themes are*******<br>
<br>
<b>General Strategy</b><br>
<br>
This will normally be your game plan: Try to go second.  If you are required to go first, grab a Shockwave and a Cataclysm with Sorreah, as without the surprise two Cataclysms are almost pointless.  If you can go second, grab two Cataclysms and draw up to five.  There are a few creatures in the deck that can give Sorreah a one-turn kill after Cataclysm (Dark Ayebaw or Xyx), but this usually won&#39;t work out and you&#39;ll just have to battle it out one-on-one.<br>
<br>
Sorreah has many ways to do this.  First, he levels the playing field with Suppress and has a huge entourage of creatures to play with.  Vemment, Alaban, Shockwave, Beam of Light, and Dark Ayebaw, and Xyx all give him direct removal spells, while Epik allows him to clear their hand of creatures.  Save one or two creatures of your own to attack with, such as Ayebaw or Nighthyren, and with or without Storm Ring they can overpower the opponent <i>fast</i>.  Try to play offensively with Sorreah if the one-turn Cataclysm doesn&#39;t work out for you.  Remove everything they throw at you while consistently attacking with some creatures of your own, and you will manage to defeat their first magi without too much difficulty.<br>
<br>
When Kalius comes out to play, you should have the Cataclysm Sorreah started with, Kalius&#39; starting cards, and any cards Sorreah netted for you.  If you managed to get a Storm Ring, Night Hyren, Ayebaw, or Xyx, great!  If not, no biggy, this combo will still blow them away.  First Cataclysm, then use his power to Windspawn any ole&#39; creature in and Shooting Star.  Even if you are forced to use Warlum, you are still attacking for 4 <i>and</i> you can fetch Agram&#39;s Staff from the deck.  If for some reason the Cataclysm theme just isn&#39;t going to work out, there are many things in the deck that work great with Kalius.  <br>
<br>
For instance, it now only costs one to play an Epik since you&#39;re just going to discard it, the same goes for Warlum.  Brannix, Ayebaw, and Nighthyren can make huge kamikaze runs, especially with Storm Rings, and coupled with the direct removal spells you can keep the board clean.  You can apply the same creature tricks as you did with Sorreah, only this time some of them only cost you 1.<br>
<br>
When it comes time for Harror, your opponent should be on his third magi.  If not, something went wrong somewhere, but the game is still very winnable for you.  If you are in Cataclysm range, use her starting Cataclysm, triggering her spellfire ability for one damage to the opponent&#39;s magi, then play Dark Ayebaw and discard your whole hand to implode the opponent to death.  <br>
<br>
If the Cataclysm strategy is not working out during the course of the game, you will know by the time you get to Kalius, and if it isn&#39;t, use Kalius&#39; starting Warlum to fetch Agram&#39;s staff. In this scenario, Harror comes into play with the ability to play all the spells and creatures in the deck at no additional cost, meaning you can spellfire and direct damage the heck out of everything.  If the Agram&#39;s Staff is discarded and you still need to use Harror, half of the creatures in the deck can be played by Arderial Shadow Magi anyway, so you can still win the game.<br>
<br>
<b>Various Popular Matchups</b><br>
<br>
Arderial Swarm:<br>
<br>
Certain things about this match-up are easier than most, and certain things are harder.  Namely, the one card that can give Kalius a bad day is Sorreah.  Usually they will not have Sorreah in their second magi slot and Kalius won&#39;t have to face him, but if he does you&#39;ll have to work around it.  You can do so with Xyxs and Dark Ayebaws, similar to your Sorreah&#39;s strategy.  Other than that, not much from Arderial will pose a large threat.  Since they will play massive amounts of creatures, Cataclysm will take them dangerously close to death.  If they play Eyes of Arderial, Beam of Light it and waight one more turn.  Brannix gets a huge boost, and you will have a fun time beating them at their own game.<br>
<br>
Orothe Interchange:<br>
<br>
If your combo goes according to plan, this match-up won&#39;t be too hard since they don&#39;t have a chance to interchange.  Because of Sorreah, O&#39;Qua can&#39;t summon a Giant Parathin and M&#39;Rika can&#39;t zip outta there.  Two things from Orothe can give you trouble, however: Barqua&#39;s Bubble and Orlon.  In the even of Barqua&#39;s Bubble, Beam of Light really shines.  All three magi have enough energy to Beam of Light before comboing, so if you have it, you will win.  As for Orlon, there are two solutions: Sorreah and Vemment.  If Sorreah does go against Orlon, you can cataclysm at will, but if he&#39;s against Kalius or Harror you have to work around anti-magic.  Vemment is great here, since he deals three damage to an Orothe creature for one, and Orlon&#39;s stuff is only protected from spells.<br>
<br>
Cald Burn:<br>
<br>
There is one difficult aspect of this match-up.  Because they rely more on spells, you usually won&#39;t have a turn when they are very low on energy.  You do have a lot of direct damage in the form of Dark Ayebaws and Kalius, and you can also deal with their creatures with Shockwaves and such, but only rarely will Cataclysm put you in killing range.  If you feel like this is taking place, throw out the Cataclysm idea and work on getting two or three large creatures in play.  Night Hyren and Ayebaw are ideal, since they are close to out-of-burn range.  This match-up will really test your wits, but this deck has the tools for the game.<br>
<br>
Dark Twins:<br>
<br>
I haven&#39;t gotten to playtest this match-up much since no one here can seem to get a Dark Twins, but if you ask me it&#39;s one of the easiest out there.  Why?  Since they automatically go first and don&#39;t know what is coming to them, they will probably play out a huge mass of creatures and leave the Twins with little amounts of energy.  Perfect.  Two magi in one Cataclysm sounds nice to me.  If the entomb Cataclysm (which they might) grab two Shockwaves with Sorreah.  You&#39;ll still be able to Cataclysm with Harror, you&#39;ll just have to work around it with Sorreah and Kalius.<br>
<br>
Naroom Swarm:<br>
<br>
Again, Cataclysm really shines here.  Since they play an obscene amount of creatures, Cataclysm should take their magi way down low to striking range.  Sorreah stops their first magi dead in its tracks, and without direct removal I can&#39;t really think of any Naroom deck posing a threat. (Please don&#39;t bash me for saying this, even if you do like Naroom.  I&#39;m just trying to promote this deck)<br>
<br>
Underneath &#39;Fuf and Fun:<br>
<br>
Since most of your damage is direct and not energy removal, Pylofufs and Burrowed stuffs will crumble just like the rest, no matter how much energy or protection they have.  Their stuff is also relatively expensive and will put you in good striking range.  I&#39;m imagining this match-up as easy, maybe a good Underneath player will show me differently at a tournament.<br>
<br>
But until someone shows me differently, I still think this deck is <i><b>STRONG!!</i></b> Thanks for bearing with me through this strat, good luck!<br>
