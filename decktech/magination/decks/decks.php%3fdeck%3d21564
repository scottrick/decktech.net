<i><b>Errata: Change the 2 Uwamar Beads to 2 Weave Huts-see Relics section for explanation.</b></i><br>
<br>
A revisit the grasslands of the Weave, based on the wonderful and constructive feedback obtained here, it was time to post a new version of Green Grass.  As for what makes this deck unique amongst the weave decks posted in the beginner category so far (to answer Arigomi&#39;s question) is it works, and it works without rares. Every card compliments each other (unlike my previous version-Tweaves and Ahdar/Drowl/Vuryips! What was I thinking?!) and works toward the goal of building a wall from which to strike from.  I fully encourage others who wish to post their no-rare weave decks here, for the open mind of the Weave likes to learn.<br>
<br>
First the background, a friend of mine got into Kybars Teeth in a huge way and in the process got a rather large collection of Weave &#39;stuff&#39; he did not want. So he kindly gave me all his commons and uncommons and here is what I cooked up (with your help). The foundation of a deck should address the 4 D&#39;s of Deck Design: Damage (how you hurt them), Discard (how to keep card advantage), Defense (how to keep them from hurting you), and Disruption (fun ways to ruin their day). <br>
<br>
This is a beginners deck, in that it has no rare cards in it, if you have some Weave rares look at &#39;Taking it to the next level&#39; below. It does rely on some combos, but would be a deck that I would use to hook someone who is big into &#39;strategy games&#39; into Magi-nation. <br>
<br>
Some things to note: This deck is made of cheap cards, common and uncommon only. And there are certainly ways to improve upon it (Will of Orothe, Lascinths, Weave Powder, etc. etc.). But for a way to have a pretty solid Weave Deck for nearly free, this one is hard to beat. <br>
<br>
<b>Magi Notes:</b><br>
<br>
Ahdar is used first. He starts with two nice creatures, but since we dont have Lascinths (which are rare) we will have to settle for the Uwamar and get as many critters in hand first. He is solid against the Tiller and Aula Draw engines (which are rampant in this area), and even against the vile Blu Draw machine he can prove to be powerful, drawing as they draw. This should assist the remaining magi and gets the needed combos into your hand to set up the defense and offense of this deck. Do not expect to hold out with Ahdar to the bitter end.  And against non-draw engines he is pretty solid as a first magi, compared to the other uncommon Magi available, he doesn&#39;t cost you cards (Iyori), and has one of the best anchors to a good defense to get the cards you need for your coming magi, the Uwamar.  <br>
<br>
<i>If on the other hand you have no/few draw engines in your meta game area, look into switching Ahdar out for Artyva and moving Quirle to be your first magi. If you end up doing that, switch the 2 Drowls to 2 Frusks so you get most of her starting cards.</i><br>
<br>
Quirle is our second mage and is the Tryn of the Weave. Like Tryn he is free energy, with the key exception that his power triggers at the Start of EACH players turn, so in a multiplayer match some creatures become massive, especially if you put it on something like a Uwamar. The trick to remember is dont put all your eggs in one basket, spread the energy out, with weave its easy to move it around, so try not to make one big target for a Shockwave or Giant Carrillions Stomp (or, *shudder*, Essence of Naroom). Do get the Tuk Berries, and hopefully by now you have one Juntertrug in hand.  This enables you to choose if your Juntertrug attacks or not by handling its cravings.<br>
<br>
Bo´Ahsa is used last. She recieves Sawgrass, Pody, and Quallon to continue the battle. She is to summon a nice team and ensure the main force is safe from harm. With weave Tactics she has the power similar to Will of Orothe, use that to your advantage and if you have the wall of grass (Quallon, Speag, Zassyfer and something else) you can make something small suddenly very huge. In reality this is where the strongest fight and strongest defense will take place, especially if you have held onto the right cards.  This is the risk with a beginner, knowing when to hold them and when to fold...er, use what you got.<br>
<br>
Now Bo&#39;Ahsa does require some good strategy notes and thanks to the feedback a couple of combos have been noted.  As the feedback increases I will edit this section as more of these are noted:<br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa and 2 Speags walk into a bar.... When an opponent attacks a speag, grab 2e for each of them you have out.  Then force them to attack the second speag and poof they get 2e more.  Now if you are truely vile and want to see someone squirm, grab 2 gum-gums, an underneath creature that can slide behind another creature.  If their first attack goes after a its Speag, Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, now your speags heave each gained 8e, if they go Gum-Gum: its Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, (now use her effect), Speag, just remember that gum-gums can only use their effect once to prevent an infinite energy gain with the speags and her effect triggers once per turn, but at your choosing.<br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa and the Wall of Life...Ingredients: 19 energy, 2 Speags (2e), a Quallon(3e), an Uwamar(3e), and a Zassyfer(3e).  Start with Uwamar, add remaining creatures in bowl, spend appropriate amount of energy.  Choose either Pody or Sawgrass to get vengence.  Results: 1e on you and 21e in the field (if you chose Sawgrass), or 2e on you and 26e in the field(if you went Pody and smacked an attacker).   Now when attacked use weave tactics to make it all huge. The way to do that is move the creature to the largest one each turn. So when they attack the first turn move them to the Uwamar, where it picks up 1e for being the defender and 2e weaved to it from the Speags. If the Uwamar can easily defeat the first attacker, weave the energy to the Quallon or Zassyfer as they have no easy way to get energy.  Now to be totally obvious, if somehow you can hold onto TWO Uwamar, Bo&#39;Ahsa becomes the monster she is destined to be.<br>
<br>
<b>Creature Notes:</b> <br>
Uwamar-The great wall of the weave, this small beast can rapidly become the battery for your weave strategy. Build him up, and weave off the juice. Remember the key is not to put all your energy in one basket. <br>
<br>
Speag- Is the defense battery, and since you get to work effects in any order the common strategy is get speag its 2e, weave energy to the defender. Use the Quallon and you can move both energy to the defender, combine that with a Zassyfer and you can essentially put 3e on a defender each time its attacked. See Bo&#39;ahsa for some of her super abuse.<br>
<br>
Vuryip - Is the one of the biggest critter in this deck, with 6e, still he is a great way to get more cards in your hand which is key to setting up the various combos this deck is good for. Have him hit the weaker creatures so you can get as many cards as possible from him. <br>
<br>
Drowl- Your other big hitter, also comes with the bonus of 2 cards for playing him. <br>
<br>
Juntertrug-Your last big hitter, problem with this brute is it has to attack, that and it doesn&#39;t have weave.  Still each turn it attacks it gets two energy when it initiates the attack.  The solution to handling this Hunger is to feed it Tuk Berries each turn.<br>
<br>
Pody- Vengence is the name of the game for this card. Most player will try to put the smackdown on him before does it to them him so hes a great way to draw attacks off of other cards. If you have placed a Will of Orothe in your deck he becomes the hand of judgement. <br>
<br>
Zassyfer - Combine this creature with a Speag and and players will be facing a 2 to 3e stronger oppponent. <br>
<br>
Bungaloo - Run them up to the biggies or against that annoying Flutter Yup, just make sure you weave one energy away and then reap the benefit of its death. 3 energy for 2 energy spent is not too bad.<br>
<br>
Quallon - If you set up the Wall of Life right you will have a Zassyfer, a Speag, and a Quallon out there with some heavy hitter. And with weave tactics it becomes very deadly. This one will become a target quickly so if the target of the attack can spare energy and survive you might want to weave 1 energy to this critter to keep it around as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Tweaves - well actually there are none in here, but the number one comment I get from reviewers is &#39;Where are the Tweaves?&#39;  The thing is this deck has multiple drawing engines that take the role of the heavy hitters, Vuryips and Drowls.  And the lead Magi, Ahdar, is a drawing machine if the opposing magi is the same.  What this means is there are too many ways to draw a Tweave out of the Draw step to include them in the deck.  So while they are the cool "Surprise!-I have you now!" of the Weave region, I could not justify keeping them when there were too many ways to get them in the wrong place.<br>
<br>
<b>Spell Notes:</b> <br>
Sawgrass- Revenge plain and simple. The Weave equivallent of Shockwave, but not as proactive. <br>
<br>
Binding - Disruption, used to force an attack, tie up his biggest and baddest and lock it on some creature you care little of. I recommend your Drowls, what this does is forces your opponent to attack the Drowl, and if you have the Speag out you gain 2e and waste one of his attackers.  Just remember it locks up the creatures effects as well as powers.  <br>
<br>
Beams of Light - I was once a huge fan of Relic Stalkers, but after seeing the need to handle small pests to make way for big attacks, the beam of light has replaced the relic stalkers of old.<br>
<br>
<b>Relic Notes:</b><br>
Weave Hut - Previously I had Uwamar Beads in here, but noticing that they only protected the magi and not your creatures I realized my mental error.  So I found a great gem in the Weave Hut.  Very very usefull against Cald, and well, lots of other spells and power too.  Now you loose it if your Magi is attacked directly and there are some creatures that do that (Night Hyren and Stagadan being two that come to mind) even if you have creatures in play.<br>
<br>
Zaya&#39;s Bow - Good for finishing off the little and weak and if they live you can force them to attack. <br>
<br>
Tuk Berries - Always try to get these in play and build up your batteries (Speag and Uwamar), as when you use this card you cant attack. Combine this with a Quallon and through the effect of weave you really have 2e to give to any of your attackers. You also will find this super usefull to lockdown your Juntertrugs cravings if you need to give it a moment to rest.<br>
<br>
<b>Play Notes:</b><br>
Whether you go first or second with Ahdar: Take the Uwamar and not the beads, the plan is to get a few creatures and put them in play with the Uwamar so to overcome the energy deficit you get when going first, or give you the energy advantage by going second. <br>
<br>
If you get a Juntertrug before you get tuk berries save it for Quirlle as he gets the Berries to start.<br>
<br>
What the real trick with this deck is saving up the right cards for Bo&#39;Ahsa while putting up a solid fight with the other magi. The cards to hold onto for Bo&#39;Ahsa is Zaya&#39;s Bow, 2 Speags, an Uwamar, and a Zassyfer.  She gets a Quallon as a starting card and a couple of vengence cards (Pody and Sawgrass). <br>
<br>
<b>Meta game:</b><br>
One can say you can never be truely prepared for anything, but looking at the decks you frequently see, you can make some adjustments and still remain in &#39;beginners&#39; category (ie: no rares).<br>
<br>
If facing alot of spell heavy Arderial or Cald decks, switch out the Drowls for Frusks as you will get to draw more cards than the one time with Drowls.<br>
<br>
If facing alot of Core, switch out the Zassyfers for Fluggs.<br>
<br>
<b>Taking it to the next level:</b><br>
If you have the rares here are some suggestions. <br>
I would swap out a Bow for a Weave Powder (Its a starting card for ALL Weave Magi-use it to fetch whatever relics you need to get.)<br>
<br>
Drop the Drowls for Lascinths (If you have the Lascinths, definately take one when you get Ahdar, makes those who are brave enough to attack, pay for their mistake, and if you can hold off for a round, use the Weave Powder get your Tuk berries and keep the Lascinth in a defensive role until you are ready to strike, one choice is to keep it in hand until you get Quirle)<br>
<br>
Drop the Podys for Grass Hyren (DE-FENCE er FENSE-enough said)<br>
<br>
Drop the remaining bows for a pair of Rayjes Belts (nothing ruins a persons day when you turn off a Uwamars wait and he suddenly has to contend with a 20e critter) <br>
<br>
Drop the Bindings for Will of Orothe (With this spell your deck becomes very very abusive.  Combined with Bo&#39;Ahsa and its fatal-for them.)<br>
<br>
Drop 2 Berries for two Gia Tomes (This really improves your ability to keep key cards in play-combined with Bungaloos and you can keep cycling them out, its the eebit of the Weave.)       </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font class="bfont"> <a href="/magination/decks/decks.php">Back to Decks Directory</a> | <A HREF="/magination/decks/decks.php?reviews=21564"> Read Reviews </A> | <a href="deckprint.php?deck=21564" TARGET="BLANK_"> Printer Friendly</a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="review"></a><font class="h2font">In order to review decks you must be a registered member. <A href="/magination/main/join.php">Sign up for free!</A></font></td></tr></table></td>
