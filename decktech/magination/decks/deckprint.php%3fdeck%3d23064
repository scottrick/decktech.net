This deck simply tries to overrun your opponent&#39;s forces with a mix of relics, spells, and of course creatures. The spells and relics are all geared towards creature combat and/or elimination, and the Magi support your creatures as well. Ven is able to keep your critters alive for a longer time, while also being able to shrink the opposing Uwamar, Speag, Forest Hyrens, Weebos and whatnot. Nara is in the midslot as a reinforcement, with her effect Rare Spirit, Fire Flow gives one of your creatures 8 energy for the price of 5, and if that&#39;s not a good deal I dont know what is. She is also quite cool in combo with Boomstick, because her 6 energize makes it usable every turn, and that can help a whole darn lot. A nice side effect as well is that your Magma Jiles and Ergars aren&#39;t affected by opposing Non-Cald spells. Bye Bye Cataclysm, Shockwave, Turn, Undertow, Tidal Wave etc. Finally, in the back is Gar, who can help your cause as well. His effect is very nice, no matter what situation. He works somewhat well with Braggle, by being able to give him 2 energy to use his Mirror Shield effect every turn and even gaining one free energy in the whole process. Now I will explain individual cards below:<br>
<br>
Dream Channel: Usually attached to a Braggle while on Nara or Gar because Braggles are hard to get rid of if your magi is Nara, and Gar allows them to stay alive longer.<br>
<br>
Primat: Starting for Ven. To be honest, there are not too many situations where this card is useful, but it&#39;s a 2 E creature and its a starting so I added it. I&#39;m looking for a substitution, not sure what though.<br>
<br>
Diomant: One of the best creatures cald has. Period. He is great. You can play him during your creatures step, transfer 5 energy back on to your magi, and then use his power Flame Hunt to deal 4 damage to a magi. You can even restore him to his starting energy with Ven, giving you a net gain of 1 energy on Ven, but I don&#39;t usually use that combo.<br>
<br>
Arbolit: Good Creature in any cald deck. Helps keep your creatures alive and is a standard in all of my cald decks.<br>
<br>
Syphon Vortex: Used mainly to eliminate opposing fat creatures before attacking the opposing magi.<br>
<br>
Magma Jile: Not a bad card at all, its brutal against Bograth, and if youre facing a bigger opponent, he is still a decent 5 energy creatures that is very hard to get rid of if your magi is Nara.<br>
<br>
Fire Flow: Used with Nara 90% of the time, you get a free 3 energy for the low low cost of 5 you get back 8 with Nara. Works for me !<br>
<br>
Firefly Swarm: Used to stall against bigger creatures, giving you more time to set up an offense and/or a defense to strike back soon.<br>
<br>
Braggle: Evil creature. I love it. It&#39;s probably one of the best Cald creatures, along with Granas and Diomant.<br>
<br>
Boomstick: Used to eliminate creatures that are you of your creature&#39;s range. Can be used continously if your Magi is Nara. I can&#39;t mention it enough, Nara&#39;s 6 E energize is invaluable in any cald deck, allowing you to play more spells and creatures to keep up the pressure.<br>
<br>
Wildfire: Only 1 in the deck, because I don&#39;t own more right now. But during playtesting, I will see how important it is in the deck, and if it seems to be working well I will certainly add more of them, because they are generally very helpful.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned before, I had planned to play this game in the upcoming storyline tournament, but I will wait for suggestions on improvement before I make the judgement on this one. Thanks for reading and helping me out. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
