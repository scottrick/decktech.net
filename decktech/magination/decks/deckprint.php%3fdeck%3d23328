This deck is fairly simple, but it can be improved greatly by adding better magi (Kesia, Zaya, Gia), creatures (Lascinth, Aritex, Blade Hyren) and relics (Gia&#39;s Tome, Weave Powder, Kesia&#39;s Flute). But those cards are all rare and can be somewhat hard to come by. The 4 rares in this deck however, are pretty easy to acquire actually. They can either be traded for, pulled from boosters, or you can get them for animite at:<br>
<br><br>
www.magi-nation.com/animite redemption. The 4 Hyren are in the Weave Preview deck, and are perfectly tournament legal.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Now, lets get on to the deck. This deck is a decent mix of big attackers (Junjetrug, Drowl, Weave Hyren), defensive creatures (Uwamar, Speag, Yajo) and discard spells (Brushfire, Sawgrass, Beam of Light).<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
The deck is fairly simple to play. Get out as many creatures as you can, and attack. Make sure to use your Magi&#39;s effects to their fullest posiblity, they will help your cause greatly. I would like to explain my choices for magi now:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Quirle: He is kind of like the Tryn of the Weave. He can be better, or worse. It&#39;s your opinion. I actually prefer him because his effect triggers Weave Hyren and lets your other creatures gain energy as well. In a multiplayer game, he is a beast, adding energy to your creatures at the beginning of each player&#39;s turn. He will usually be able to take out one magi by himself.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa: She is a great equilizer. If the opponent overwhelmed you with his attacks while you were on Quirle, Bo&#39;Ahsa will let you recover quickly by letting you choose who the opponent attacks. This can get very frustrating if you have creatures like Speag (Which gains energy from attacks) or Lascinth (Which deals removes energy first. Advanced). Her starting Sawgrass also lets you get rid of a threat that attacked last turn immediately as well.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Taisa: Taisa is a beast. Her effect is just great, and her starting cards are top notch as well. Her 6 energize ensures that you will have enough energy to keep playing 1-2 creatures every turn, in the late game when you most need it. With her, you should always use her effect weave whenever possible, to get an easy energy advantage over the opponent by pulling energy off your magi to assist your creatures in help.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
95% of all cards in this deck either provide you with energy and/or card advantage, and both can help you pull a game your way when your&#39;re in trouble. Cards like Sawgrass, Beam of Light, and Brushfire weaken or destroy opposing creatures, and critters like Drowl make sure that you always have your hands full. *In this deck, that is a good thing, usually.*<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Your biggest hitters on the offensive end are:<br>
<br><br>
Junjertrug, Drowl, Weave Hyren, Vuryip, and possibly Grass Hyren.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
On the defensive end, your all stars are:<br>
<br><br>
Uwamar, Speag, Yajo, (Taisa), Grass Hyren, Quallon, Pody.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
This deck usually has a very easy time defending against the opponent, and cards like Warrior&#39;s Boots make sure that you can strike back often and hard when it hurts them the most.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
A deck very similar to this one won me the first tourney I&#39;ve ever been in almost a year ago, and weave has not gotten any weaker since then.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Again, the easiest way to get the 4 rares in this deck is to redeem animite for them at:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
www.Magi-Nation.com/AnimiteRedemption. if that doesn&#39;t work, just go to Magi-Nation.com and you will be able to find you way from here.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy this deck, I know I did.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
UPDATE: I will try to update this deck every now and then, after I play games against certain types of decks. Mainly I&#39;m looking to test it agains *Sigh* Akido, Dark Twins, Bograth Swarm, and Burrow. I will update this section afterwards to post the strategies you should use against those decks.<br>
