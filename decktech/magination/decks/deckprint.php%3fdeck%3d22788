Total: 40 + 3 Magi   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After experimenting and testing with Paradwyn, two deck approaches stood out to me as possibilities.  The first was stalking; there&#39;s a lot of cards that stalk, and lot of cards that gain advantages from stalking, so I put them together to form this deck.  (The other approach deals with Dreamwarp and Ookami, but I stuck mainly with the stalker theme)<br>
<br>
Magi:<br>
Liriel is in the first position because of her consistant ability to pull Bagalas.  You&#39;ll want to go first, and you&#39;ll want to pull all three of her starting cards.  Generally, you will pay one to pull a Bagala Hunter and play that and the Cub.  This way on your next turn you have a guarenteed way to stalk a creature (the Hunter) and play Froxfire before attacking, or you can just gain the benefits from Hunter and play another creature.  Your attack phase is always loads of fun.  You gain energy left and right from this and that, while your opponent loses it from that and the other.  <br>
<br>
Ardonia is second for his mass destruction capabilites.  For his starting Jungle Stalker, you can pull K&#39;ly, Khisp, Jungle Jile, or Bagala Hunger.  Since he starts with another Jungle Jile anyway, I usually pull Bagala Hunter or Khisp, but it is entirely up to you.  There are many ways to ensure everything is stalked for Adronia&#39;s ability:  K&#39;ly makes them stalked if your opponent is about to flip over a new magi, Jungle Jile can stalk all their current creatures, as can Crushing Vines.  When you have one or two Poison Baloo Roots out along with Ardonia, you can kill entire 3energy armies without even attacking.<br>
<br>
Culla comes in for the finish with high energy and good starting cards.  She can grab any of the stalkers that Ardonia could plus a Stalker&#39;s Boots.  Culla is an attacking magi just like Liriel.  You will always want to attack and play the spells that help your attacks.  Not much strategy involved here.<br>
<br>
As you can see there really is not too much complex strategy involved with this deck; you will want to attack, and you will want to attack often.  Most everything in the deck complements your attacks to some extent, so as long as you are on the offensive you should be alright.  Never pass up an oppurtunity to attack; you will want to finish off the opponent as quickly as possible before they start drawing tons and tons of cards and mass removal spells to deal with your threats.  The quicker you get going, the quicker your opponent is dead.<br>
<br>
Individual Card Choices:<br>
<br>
Spell Pulse:  I play this over Beam of Light and Relic Stalker for a couple reasons.  It costs only two instead of the four for BoL.  The only relic it could destroy of yours is Stalker&#39;s Boots since Warrior&#39;s Boots and Cape are discarded immediately anyway.  It also discards ALL spells, so when your Arderial or Bograth opponent starts playing utility relic after utility relic and draws tons of cards, you can take them all out at once.  Or, you can remove all spells so bye bye Shadow Geyser deck (in the rare event).  Finally, it just has a cooler picture.<br>
<br>
Poison Baloo Root:  While it doesn&#39;t do a thing for Stalking, it does remove a lot of energy for cheap, which complements Ardonia nicely.  I think it&#39;s a great card, and almost a no-brainer for Paradwyn decks.<br>
<br>
Why not Tropical Vinoc?:  Hmmm, I thought about him.  It is another creature way to make things stalked.  The hardest thing about this deck was fine-tuning, and in the end I found that he just wasn&#39;t providing the results I wanted for one card slot.<br>
<br>
Hope you like the deck, I mainly posted it because of the lack of Paradwyn (or post-ND decks for that matter) on decktech. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
