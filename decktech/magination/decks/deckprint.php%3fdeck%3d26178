<br />
O&#39;QUA- O&#39;qua&#39;s main purpose is to draw. but she does more that just draw. She conjures abaquists to steal there creatures while haveing the karak cards in play. so you would gain 2 and draw 2. She plays deep barls and uses them on the used up sea barls. Sometimes against weenie decks you can just drop a nalo or conjure one to take out one of there magi.<br />
<br />
M&quot;RIKA- Her main purpose is to lay out lots  of stuff and interchange. by this time you should have a big hand unless they pulled trug rihgt off the bat, which is unlikely. Play a reef hyren, some phrups,barquas bubble, wellsiks, but make sure that you DONT play the orlons ring or you wont be able to interchnge. In case you dont know what orlons ring does it cost 0 and it says: at the end of your turn discard from play all non orothe cards and add energy to your magi equal to the number of orothe relics you have in play. now arosa will be out with 12 energy and ready.<br />
<br />
AROSA- play the karak relics,hubdras cube to steal anything,and orlons ring. use shell game at the end of your turn to give away maybe a used sea barl or a 1 energy abaquaist. Steal as much stuff as possible. and using the opponentns cards to kill them. Imagine being killed by your own creatures? well you better start. usually Arosa will win the game. That boost fo creatures friom M&#39;rika is awesome too.<br />
<br />
M&#39;RIKA AGAIN- just play her out liek a normal orothe magi using the tidal waves,undertows to take out there big critters while you creatures can come out and get past them. <br />
<br />
***CARD BREAKDOWN*** <br />
<br />
Abaquist- Steal stuff <br />
Wellsik -stop them from trying to play an ormagon or pylofuf.<br />
Phrup-stop thunderquakes, or anything threatining <br />
Nalo-weenie control <br />
Deep barl-drawing and solid creature <br />
Sea barl-draw <br />
river abaquist-control <br />
reef hyren-weenie control <br />
bog wellsik- free creature now why wouldnt i want that?<br />
Crushing surf-relic control and creature discard <br />
Submerge -pump up the little critters like abaquist.<br />
undertow-creature removal <br />
Tidal wave-discard <br />
Barquas bubble -protection<br />
karak necklace-draw  <br />
karak band-free energy <br />
Hubdras cube- relic control  <br />
Orlons ring-this card rules free energy to your magi of course i want to play that.<br />
<br />
I strictly play pure orhte that means no Thunderquakes,ormagons or anything like that because of the ring.<br />
<br />
i think the Merchant Disabaler decks will be very hrd to handle for most decks and begginers. I have tested this deck a lot and its very succesful.<br />
