<br>
First a good consistant Twins start: Entomb, Wudge, Maelstorm.  You get 4 more cards at the beginning of your turn so most of the time will be able to put out 3 creatures.  That puts the Wudge out of Beam of Light range.  Don&#39;t worry about it if you have the Shadow Cloak.  <br>
<br>
So first - Entomb Thunderquake for your use, and to prevent opponents.  Then Wudge plus creatures.  If you have a Shadow Cloak, use that right away as well (the usual always use right before a Magi is turned). <br>
<br>
After the first turn, just play what your draw gives you.  Boot&#39;d Harbans combo&#39;d w/ TQ and Zunggs are always nice (taking their creatures).  A Boot&#39;d Raveled Drush is even better since it grows and then can target the Magi directly w/ its ability - great vs. creatureless.  <br>
<br>
Keep those Climbing Staff&#39;s - almost all top level decks target your Magi directly at some time - discarding a timely Staff will waste their 10 energy Maelstorm, or Spirit Drain, or Crown, or many other things.  <br>
<br>
Between the start and speed of the Twins you should be running through Magi before they get set up or draw too many cards.  As the game progresses keep using the Entombs to take their best cards (Brushfire, Crushings, etc.).<br>
<br>
Warrada has a great start, and can really put a crimp on some regions.  If the board is somewhat clean (i.e. Tomes/TQ) don&#39;t put out a creature to take advantage of her ability to energize for 10.  Put out all her relics, and try to regain board control.  Usually your opponent has used a lot to get rid of the Twins, so a quick Warrada with the Tomes (that cannot be discarded) works wonders.  <br>
<br>
Card choices:<br>
<br>
Orok: not a bad card, but in there just so Warrada has a guaranteed creature if needed.<br>
<br>
Core Crag: Great vs. weenie swarms - plus can finish off Magi.<br>
<br>
Harban: I love this card.  Works great w/ Entomb&#39;d TQ, Zungg, boot&#39;d attackers, others.  Gives you chump blockers/attacers.  And does not use energy to take over creatures, so can attack weenies on his own after taking one over!<br>
<br>
Raveled Drush:  Another great card that can grow and target Magi directly.  Great w/ Boots.<br>
<br>
Koil:  Get those TQ&#39;s and Maelstorms back in your deck for the Tomes.<br>
<br>
Wudge: Do I need to say anything?  The most power efficient card in the game?<br>
<br>
Zungg: Cost effective, good w/ Harban.  Solid.<br>
<br>
Entomb: Wreaks most high level decks.  Crushing Wind/Fungus?  Brushfire?  Thunderquake?  Now all dead weight. <br>
<br>
Vaporize:  Should be in all Core decks.  Too many relics out there to not run.  Also takes energy off Magi as a bonus.<br>
<br>
Thunderquake:  Great removal.  Works w/ your creatures and Maelstorm well.<br>
<br>
Maelstorm: Finisher.  Don&#39;t use it for more than 4-5 energy w/ the prevalence of Climbing Staffs.<br>
<br>
Secrets of the Book:  Great card drawing.<br>
<br>
Tomes:  The right card when you need it!  Especially if they have some good ones in their discard!<br>
<br>
Warrada&#39;s Ring:  Free cards or energy advantage.  Not too shabby.<br>
<br>
Shadow Cloak:  Always useful.  Who doesn&#39;t target opponent&#39;s cards?  Now they only can every other turn.<br>
<br>
Essence of Naroom:  Especially now with multi-regions this is nice.  Gives Warrada time vs. Paradwyn and the occasional Naroom.<br>
<br>
Climbing Staffs:  Too many good players are playing mass-discard then target your Magi.  This stops that cold.<br>
<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots:  Speed.  Always useful.<br>
<br>
That is it!  Suggestions welcome if some thought has been put in them (i.e. no &quot;thunderquakes are not core&quot; comments).  I am looking for room for another Book and maybe a Belt.  Hopefully I will be making GenCon and seeing how it stacks up against all the wonderful combo decks that will show up :)<br>
<br>
Thanks, and good luck!<br>
