Erm buddy, thanks for reviewing the deck twice (how did you do that?) I&#39;m trying to delete one, but decktech didn&#39;t give me a single dime for posting this deck, so I seem to be stuck... Anyone know why I cannot gain TP?!?!?<br>
<br><br>
***UPDATE*** The last spell is Equilibrate, sorry about spelling error I didn&#39;t catch it. ***END***<br>
<br><br>
Why Toast?<br>
<br><br>
The basic principle behind the deck is to remove energy every turn and in every way. Sounds simple? It is. Thats why this deck wins. The cards fall easy, the combos are easy to pull of. The game is straight-forward. Every card in this deck has been designed to affect your opponent in some way as soon as it hits the table. You&#39;ll find you have incredible presence incredibly soon in the game. The creatures are small, and easy to come out to hit your opponent quickly. Your goal is to "toast" him, or burn through his magi quickly while he is still waiting to find "cards" or save up "more energy" However, you don&#39;t have these same kinds of restrictions. Your deck has been MADE for speed and effecientcy. You&#39;ll "toast" through his first 2 magi so quickly, your opponent will wonder how it all happened, and so fast.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Try Toast for yourself! You&#39;ll be amazed.<br>
<br>
CREATURES: The creatures are small, their purpose is to always be playable. Many creatures can remove energy with powers: (ergar, drakan, magma hyren) others are just there for bruisers. (lava balamant) Use them to your advantage! Ergars can shock away with scroll of fire, removing two, and you&#39;ll find your giant arbolls add a lot of energy combined with the spells.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
SPELLS: Spells are the core being of this deck. Yes there are lots. Yes they hurt... add a scroll of fire, and you&#39;ll quickly see that between your creatures like drakan and ergar and the spells in your hand, your opponent will be quite dry of energy. He will have little, you will have lots! You take control of the board. The funnest thing about the deck is that you set the pace. You&#39;ll love it when your opponent asks YOU if HE can play a creature, and then sighs when you thermal blast it away...(again) Equilerberate the the funnerest spell in the game, (yes thats a word, funnerest) It&#39;s great with Valkan, or scroll of fire. it brings down to starting energy, then removes an additional 1 for scroll, 2 for valkan, or 3 if both! And the whole thing only costs 3. Ouch... <br>
<br><br>
<br>
RELICS: Warriors boots are obviously there to get the speed advantage. Play a giant arboll during your spell phase to add a few E before attacking.<br>
<br><br>
Relic stalkers are for gaurd wings and similar relics. Don&#39;t waste it on a water of life, save it for something that affects your board more. :-)<br>
<br><br>
MAGI:<br>
<br><br>
BARAK: He&#39;s a hero! Use his power to gain the speed advantage early. Go first if possible. Take advantage of his massive amounts of starting energy. Whether you take the arbolit is up to you, but keep in mind it is not always worth the extra card you could draw, (use your best judgement) Things get off very quickly with barak. Zap all your opponents creatures with spells, never back down, or your opponent will get ahead. Find things will prophecy to burn your opponents first magi&#39;s few creatures. Keep the speed up and the pressure on. <br>
<br><br>
Due to his energy and power, barak can go a long way. With any luck, your opponent will be on magi #2, (Barak and some spells can go through magi #1 in 2 turns or so, depending on what you draw) before barak goes down.<br>
<br><br>
(try to save an equaliberate for Valkan of possible.)<br>
<br><br>
VALKAN: His power is crazy! sure he only energizes 4. but this guy is just insane. Your opponents creatures will be dropping faster than he can play him. Valkan can easily enough chip away and finish off your opponents second magi, if you have a good run of spells it can happen almost automatically. Your spells hurt! 2 extra, 3 with scroll :-)<br>
<br><br>
VORGA: If Valkan falls, don&#39;t worry. Vorga is the most powerful magi this deck has, and the cards you get will let you easily stand toe to toe with any magi your opponent has for you. If your opponent is on his or her last magi (they should be if vorga comes out) It&#39;s in the bag. Otherwise, make sure magi #2 goes down quickly. She starts with everyones favorite relic: scroll of fire and her power is just unfair. Use your cheap spells in addition to shatter to take out your opponents big creatures. Remember all your spells do one more. You can take out a 6E creature for 3E, which isin&#39;t too shabby. Use Ergars with your scroll, and dust your opponent off. <br>
<br><br>
Energy comes and goes very quickly in this deck, and you should try to use as much as you can, since nothing in this deck is worth "saving" for. Remember above all else your greatest advantage is speed. Your cheap spells and creatures can come together to remove large amounts of energy quickly. NEVER let your opponent get ahead or get set up. If you can keep the pressure on, and your opponents creatures are dropping as they hit the board, the less likely your opponent is to ever recover. Warriors boots is your best friend! Use it to gain the speed advantage. <br>
<br><br>
Try Toast for yourself. Your opponent will never catch a break, and he&#39;s never safe from you! Good Luck and have fun, HAPPY TOASTING!<br>
