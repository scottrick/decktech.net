Reasoning behind the Magi<br>
<br>
Warrada is a deadly Magi, in any slot. If you go first, she has a total of 17e, and if second 22e. She has a trio of solid starting cards (Although if you go second, you may want to pass on the Chaos Jile) and her ability is a great help when your opponent just can&#39;t finish her off. <br>
<br>
As a side note on Warrada, the Essence of Naroom was placed in the deck due to the opposing decks around my area, and it&#39;s usually pulled first tur, even if an opponent isn&#39;t playing Naroom or Weave. Better to get it out of the way rather than have it haunt you later, eh? ;)<br>
<br>
Now, on to Harror... Harror is a powerful magi in her own respect, with nice energy and a powerful effect. The icing on the cake would be her ability to flip over and draw a card capable of wiping out your opponent&#39;s entire force. Couple Cataclysm with a Dark Ayebaw and Harror is almost guaranteed to wipe out an opposing Magi.<br>
<br>
Morag is the final Magi due to his obscenely high energize, additionally if your opponent has a relic-heavy deck, Morag can steal the choiciest relic for a few turns.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
Why I put those critters in<br>
<br>
Borgor and Grax: Both of these are large creatures, and additionally they have the ability to cleave large opposing creatures in half. <br>
<br>
Chaos Jile: Chaos Jile is a decent creature, and can grow to a huge energy if left unchecked. However, I was finding too many people that would attack a Chaos Jile with a creature 3e weaker than the jile, and effectivley kill it. Thus I only stuck the one Jile in because it is a starting card for Warrada.<br>
<br>
Core Grag: I don&#39;t really think this one needs much explaining. Paying 5e to do damage to an entire army of creatures and their magi is a good deal.<br>
<br>
Dark Ayebaw: One of my favorite magi finishers, also good for picking the weak off of the battlefeild. <br>
<br>
Dryte Fiend: The Fiends are excellent defensive cards, along with this, they can be rather... nasty when used with Harror&#39;s spellfire.<br>
<br>
Koil: Nightmare helps to Turn opposing creatures, Re-Koil helps me get my Discard pile back where I want it, that is to say, in my deck.<br>
<br>
Orok: Orok is a well blanced card. It has midrange energy, it&#39;s effect kicks in whenever he&#39;s involved in an attack, and is good for whittling an opposing magi down.<br>
<br>
Wudge: Wudge are great creatures, the growth potential they have is sometimes overwhelming, and with the suicide creatures (Dark Ayebaw, Core Grag) coming and going it helps to keep something like Wudge in play.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~<br>
The magic behind the spells<br>
<br>
Cataclysm: Great card that cataclysm, for only 11e with Harror (10e with anyone if it gets Entombed) you get to wipe the board clean. As stated above, following up a Cataclym with a Dark Ayebaw is fun.<br>
<br>
Corrupt: If played at the right time, Corrupt can turn the tide of the game. Of course, it could prove equally effective if you go first and draw one.<br>
<br>
Dream Rift: With the amount of creautres in the deck, along with it&#39;s being a starting card for Morag, Dream Rift is a good way to recycle your old creatures.<br>
<br>
Entomb: Entomb is fun to use, Entomb Cataclysm and have fun watching your opponents wonder when it&#39;s going show up. Playing Arderial? Entomb Shocwave while you&#39;r at it! Entomb has bunches of uses as long as you remember what spells your opponent has flung at you.<br>
 <br>
Maelstrom: Another good card to use Post-Cataclysm, also just great &quot;For hitting the dreamers instead of their dreams.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turn: Tired of having that Gorath Stealing your creatures? Sick of that Forest Hyren bosting up armies&#39; energy? Nail &#39;em then Steal &#39;em. I&#39;ve also found this spell to be one of the most effective against a Braggle.<br>
<br>
Vaporize: Relic Destruction, aditionally deals damage. A great spell, and there should be at least one in every Core deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~<br>
Relics, A to Z<br>
<br>
Essence of Naroom: (See side note under Warrada)<br>
<br>
Relic Stalker: The Lone Relic Stalker is around for when an opponent has only one or two relics out (which makes Vaporize uneconomical) and one of those relics is really messing you up.<br>
<br>
Shadow Bones: For boosting up the Borgor and Grax after they use their ability, mostly. Recently I&#39;ve found that it works equally as well on an Orok.<br>
<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: The creature&#39;s that are most fun to boots in would be the Koil, Core Grag (My all-time favorite), Chaos Jile, and Dark Ayebaw.<br>
