TOTAL : 45 Cards    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(<b>Quick note</b> - Before someone tries to start giving me bad ratings for copying the sample deck, guess what; that&#39;s my deck. Even says so on there. I just decided I might as well get impressions of it anyway, since those I have spoken to that use it as the basis of their Weave archetypes have had success.) <br>
<br>
* - This is a metagaming decision; my environment is slightly more Core- and Naroom-centric, and in an environment like that there are cases where a Stone Storm is much more efficient than a Thunderquake for removal. If your area is more apt to have more, lesser sized Creatures than fewer larger ones, however, replacing this with another Thunderquake would be more effective. <br>
<br>
** - Another metagaming decision; because Relic removal is not vital in this area, Beam of Light can be used over Relic Stalker because of versatility. In a more Relic- heavy environment, one Beam can and should be replaced with a Relic Stalker, making Gia able to Unearth it if necessary.</i> <br>
<br>
<b>GIA</b><br>
<br>
The goal with Gia in this deck is pure aggression; on average, her first and second turn will consist of the following: <br>
<br>
Turn 1 <br>
<br>
P/S/R 1: Play Weave Powder, pay 1 and discard it to Unearth a Junjertrug Horn. Use Summon to search deck for a Junjertrug. <br>
<br>
Play Creatures: Spend 7 energy to play Junjertrug, and try to play another cheap Creature. <br>
<br>
P/S/R 2: Nothing. Draw two and end turn. <br>
<br>
Turn 2 <br>
<br>
P/S/R 1: Summon another Junjertrug. Play Book oes; uses Lore if necessary. Pay 1 to discard the Book to Unearth a Warrior&#39;s Boots and use Warpath to play the second Junjertrug. <br>
<br>
And then you would play out the turn, and subsequently the game, as strategically as possible. You probably will not need to Unearth much else; if your Junjertrug Horn gets discarded, there&#39;s no great need to get the other one. <br>
<br>
<b>BO&#39;AHSA</b> <br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa switches the pace of the game and can be the most time consuming matchup for the opponent; she can also be an exercise in slight rules-lawyering to your advantage if the need arises. Your goal with her is to always give yourself an advantage on defense by manipulating her Creatures&#39; energy with insightful planning (superior tactics). An average attack against her may be something like this: <br>
<br>
Bo&#39;Ahsa has a 2E Speag, 3E Quallon, and a 4E Pody in play. The opponent attacks the Speag with an 8E Furok. Speag gains 2E per its Effect then uses Weave combined with Quallon&#39;s Rapid Change to transfer 2E to Pody. Bo&#39;Ahsa then uses Weave Tactics to make Pody the defender instead of Speag. Because of the change in defenders, any Effects involving the new defender being attacked that haven&#39;t been processed yet for that Creature can be used; Pody&#39;s Weave is activated and Rapid Change is used to transfer 2E from Quallon to Pody. The end result is an 8E Pody vs. a previously unstoppable 8E Furok. <br>
<br>
That example is more of a &#39;worst case&#39; situation, you should have more options in play on defense, generally speaking. Lascinth, Grass Hyren, and against Core, Flugg, can be devastating in her hands. <br>
<br>
<b>ZAYA</b> <br>
<br>
Zaya is, of all things, the finisher in this deck; it&#39;s not incredibly likely the opponent will have more cards than you at this point, as your ability to stall with Bo&#39;Ahsa should have you prepared for mostly anything, with a hand to match. With her Bow, Zaya is an unforgiving defender, able to force the opponent to step blindly into a deathtrap. The strategy with Bo&#39;Ahsa needs the least explanation; hold the Bow in your hand until it can actually be useful, don&#39;t just throw it out for an extra point of damage so that it can be discarded before it can be abused. Simply set your most powerful defenders in place and let them clear the path for a game ending counterstrike. <br>
<br>
Special Considerations <br>
<br>
<i>Vs. Sorreah</i> <br>
<br>
You really don&#39;t have much to fear from Sorreah; with Gia, being unable to Unearth slows you down, but you should at least be able to get a Junjertrug Horn with Weave Powder your second turn, then proceed from there. If you know you&#39;re facing Sorreah first, you probably will want to skip the Book oes in the hopes of drawing something useful. Bo&#39;Ahsa will be the one most hurt by Sorreah; you have more energy than him, so you can win through sheer brute force, and Weave Tactics only makes her energy manipulation and defense more abusive, but it&#39;s not a necessity. With Zaya, you never intended to use her anyway. <br>
<br>
<i>Vs. Discard</i> <br>
<br>
If your director allows changes in Magi order, move Zaya to the front of the line, followed by Gia and then Bo&#39;Ahsa. The problem should basically be solved, as most discard decks can&#39;t handle that; there are very rare discard decks that the combination of taking their cards away right back and being able to get another during your turn won&#39;t work against. In that case, you may want to try working in Uwamar Beads to Unearth with Gia. Junjertrug Horn is also another card to try and keep out as much as possible to keep you in Creatures; if they can&#39;t deal with the Horn, they&#39;ll eventually run out of means to stop the Junjertrugs, and you should have energy to spare, since most discard decks require stalling to prepare before finishing a magi. <br>
<br>
<i>Vs. Core</i> <br>
<br>
Nothing really special here, except that you should definitely save Flugg for Bo&#39;Ahsa; any player with his wits about him will attack Flug directly-that should be your opportunity to Weave as much energy to it as you can, Weave Tactics a new Creature into the fray (giving it +4E in the process), and potentially Weave more to Flugg, trying to keep it able to survive Creature combat as long as you can. <br>
<br>
<i>Using Aritex</i><br>
<br>
A lot of people badmouth Aritex, but I have never seen anything but a look of distress on my opponent after using it. The key is what you use it with-you want to sacrifice the smallest Creature possible to it, one that doesn&#39;t have a very versatile ability, or that is too small to be effective any longer; using Weave to pull energy off in the Attack Step to make the Creature as small as possible can do the job. This is also the best thing to use for those Tweaves you happen to have gotten outside of your Draw Step. I would recommend not using Aritex, however, if you have more than one or two energy on your Magi; you should have been able to spend it on something, and there&#39;s no reason not to. The best time to use Aritex overall has been when you reveal a new Magi against an opposing one who is barely standing, as then you can mount a fairly solid defense and then refresh your Magi, effectively giving you two as your next turn will be just as good as having a new Magi, resource-wise. <br>
<br>
<i>Using Harmony</i> <br>
<br>
Harmony is a beautiful little equalizer; most people look at its effect on all Creatures in play and dismiss it, but that&#39;s the point..In play. Flip a fresh Magi, Harmony, then play your defenses against a group of crippled forces. Combine with Zaya and her Bow plus Lascinth or Grass Hyren to wipe the board clean, or any Magi with Jumbor. <br>
<br>
<b>Held Cards</b> <br>
<br>
And, finally, these are cards you should try to hold for the appropriate Magi (Gia is listed in the slight chance she isn&#39;t first). This listing does not count starting cards: <br>
<br>
GIA - Any Relic that isn&#39;t immediately useful, with the exception of Weave Powder. <br>
<br>
BO&#39;AHSA - Quallon, Grass Hyren or Lascinth, Jumbor, and Flugg (vs. Core). <br>
<br>
ZAYA - Harmony, Grass Hyren or Lascinth. <br>
<br>
Also, if there are any other situations/metagaming issues you would like to know about, D-mail me about it and I&#39;ll add it in here. And this is by no means a final version..It&#39;s already had another major overhaul with ND, look for another remix as soon as I can legally post it. <br>

Response to Reviews <br>
<br>
<i>Vs. Burrow</i> - Burrow is very uncommon around here, and from the reputation Underneath has, it seems like it ould be in general. If it is a problem in your area, I would recommend replacing a Junjertrug Horn with a Rayje&#39;s Sword, since Weave can usually manipulate its energy to minimize losses while hammering away while they&#39;re burrowed, and both Weave and Underneath can stall the game indefinitely like this. Drop your Sword at the best possible time (such as when you outnumber their Creatures and have a Harmony in hand), make a cleansing strike, then continue as normal. <br>
<br>
<i>Vs. Cataclysm</i> - Aside from the general advice to not over-commit, there really is nothing Weave can do to protect from Cataclysm. Even if Osatch weren&#39;t so volatile, it, like Colossus, Crystal Parmalag, etc., cannot stop Cataclysm, because their effects protect them from specific discard, while Cataclysm is non-specific. <br>
<br>
<i>Too Many Single/Too Few Copies of Cards</i> - You would notice that, with two exceptions, all of the singles are either Weave Relics or starting cards; this is because of Weave Powder, mainly. Every Magi starts with it, so you might as well have something to go get with it, and there are plenty of strong Weave Relics to choose from. Gia&#39;s Unearth is also another reason, the sheer versatility she can have being able to call any of these relics out when needed. The Stone Storm is metagame specific, and while there are a good amount of large Creature decks, not enough to go with these over Thunderquake. Flugg is basically overkill against Core; you wouldn&#39;t have great difficulty anyway, but a hoser will put you over the top, or even turn the game around. The ket point is, neither of these cards are essential, but they&#39;re still useful enough that it doesn&#39;t hurt to draw them. <br>
<br>
As for too few copies of cards, very few cards are so essential that you need three of them. I prefer giving myself more options, because while a lot of Weave Creatures are synergous with each other, they usually don&#39;t interact greatly just with multiple copies of themselves, and that&#39;s the risk you run with three. Two is a good number, because it insures that there are enough copies in the deck that you will draw them, but not too many so that it is all you get. 	 </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
