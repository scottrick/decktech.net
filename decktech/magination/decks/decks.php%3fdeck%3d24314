Another one of those *fun for me, but not you decks*. The relics and creatures that fueled the first one got MRP&#39;d, but I knew the idea of the deck still had possibility. I&#39;ve spent the last 3 weeks or so tweaking it here and there trying to get the best performance possible with the 2-3 card slots I had available for alteration. The decklist is what I came up with.<br>
<br>
I was the top Orothe player of the storyline (The Great Relic Robbery). <br>
<br>
Magi Explanations: <br>
<br>
O&#39;Qua: The draw engine, just like before. I take 5 random cards for my starting hand, and start conjuring out Sea Barls and Bubble Xyx&#39;s to fill my hand. <br>
<br>
Voice of the Storm: The power Magi of the deck. Take the Hurricane Orish, and search your deck for the Cloud Scepter first, the Quill second, the Karak Necklace, the Karak Band, or the Hubdra&#39;s Cube; with preffered cards first to last, based on what you&#39;ve already might have in hand from O&#39;Qua&#39;s power drawing. <br>
<br>
Bria: Backup Magi. Name *Arderial*, if it wasn&#39;t obvious, with her effect *Obesession*. Now you can play all the relics in the deck without a problem. Once again, grab the relics listed above in the same order. <br>
<br>
Card Explanations: <br>
<br>
Sea Barl/Bubble Xyx: Card draw engines. They help fill the hand to search for needed setup cards, or later to help fill up your hand again to feed the Cloud Scepter and thin the deck. <br>
<br>
River Abaquist: My favorite little guy;) He&#39;s here to steal. Relics are the easiest and cheapest resource to get into play for his theft ability. He reduces the amount of creature removal required for the deck, turning the advantage in my favor after taking a few of my opponents good creatures. <br>
<br>
Hurricane Orish: The best creature out of ND in my opinion. He&#39;s a good size creature; not too large, not too small. His effect is amazingly good, helping to fuel my turns when my opponent tries to do something about me gaining board control. <br>
<br>
Spray Narth: One of the newest additions of this Aikido variant. He&#39;s free when I have a Bubble Xyx or Hurricane Orish in play. He can help defend, attack, or combo with the Pharan as an energy battery. Free energy and creatures is always good. <br>
<br>
Hunter Jile: He breaks Corrupt for O&#39;Qua or combo&#39;s with the Quill to dump your opponent&#39;s hand of creatures. <br>
<br>
Ormagon: Swarm control. He also combos with the Quill to clear out Underneath creatures if I really need. <br>
<br>
Orpus: Relic protection. Pump him a little with the Rayje&#39;s Shield and Ring of Secrets. <br>
<br>
Pharan: Energy Battery. He combos with the Spray Narths *which receive most of the energy from playing relics under Ring of Secrets*. This extra energy was something I lacked in previous variants, and is badly needed to keep the deck running at full throttle. <br>
<br>
Cloud Scepter: The primary drawing engine once past O&#39;Qua. Your goal is to cycle your deck and cast Shell every turn. It also helps find needed cards for the tricks in this deck. <br>
<br>
Quill: It&#39;s for tricks. Hack the Shells *to protect stolen creatures of different regions*, Hunter Jile, Ormagon, and mainly Forgotten Dancer. <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Shield: Free energy. The 2 energy to play it is quickly made back with all the card drawing. It keeps your Xyx&#39;s and Barls alive longer to draw more cards without having to kill and replay them, allowing you to keep your deck thin. It beefs up your guys to receive attacks, or to finish off Magi quickly. <br>
<br>
Karak Band/Necklace: Useful relics with all the theft. Keep in mind they only activate once a turn; however, their limited use is more helpful than you probably think. <br>
<br>
Eye of Arderial: Mass removal protection. Primarily for Arderial match ups. Name Catyclsm as your spell EVERY turn. They would have to beam + Caty to get around it that turn, costing them far too much energy. Not only that, Shell should be in place *unless they had a chance to name it* to protect your creatures. Against Core, name Vaporize, and against anyone you feel might be packing Spell Pulse, name it. I generally only play it against Arderial. <br>
<br>
Sandswirl: Turns off Deep Wellisk, Reef Hyren, Sorreah, and various other annoying cards. <br>
<br>
Climbing Staff: Read what you can do when you discard it from your hand. That&#39;s why it is in here. <br>
<br>
Shell: Part of a lock. You should be cycling every turn, or every other turn. Play shells to protect your creatures from everything but attacks, which shouldn&#39;t happen very often thanks to the theft in this deck. Also, it acts as anti-discard. Storm of Fishes would be very bad. <br>
<br>
Beam of Light: Versatility. <br>
<br>
Undertow/Thunderquake: General removal spells. They help at times, and you should always have some sort of removal/suicide mechanism in every deck. <br>
<br>
Your goals are as follows: <br>
<br>
1. Draw as much as you can on O&#39;Qua to set up Voice. <br>
<br>
2. Theft. Steal their creatures to weaken their resources, while increasing yours. Steal relics that you can use. <br>
<br>
3. Board Control. Play the Hurricane Orish first on Voice, then play your other guys for very low cost *free in the case of Spray Narth*. River Abaquist, when warped to 2e, costs you 1. Bubble Xyx costs you 1. Pharan 2, etc. <br>
<br>
4. Cycling. Start drawing as much as you can to cycle your deck every turn, giving you options, River Abaquists, and the Pharan every turn. Use the Goggles every turn. Discard anything you do not immediately need. Always leave the Pharan and Shell. You want these cards every single turn. Use the Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel every turn to increase the recycle rate. <br>
<br>
5. Energy gain. Dump energy on the Pharan or Spray Narth. Sack them both and add it back to your Magi to power up for more card drawing and theft. <br>
<br>
6. Protection. Shell every turn to keep your guys safe from Ormagon, Catyclsm, and opposing theft decks. Pump up the Orpus a little with the Rayje&#39;s Shield and Ring of Secrets. Don&#39;t overdo it, you don&#39;t need much, but he can save you against Beam of Light, Vaporize, or Catyclysm by protecting valuable relics. <br>
<br>
7. Beat down. With everything else in place, and board control in hand, begin with the beats. You don&#39;t have to steal everything in play. The theft is just an extremely efficient form of creature control that beefs up your defense/offense while neutralizing that of your opponents. If you have few of your own creatures in play, Shell + Quill will protect the guys you&#39;ve stolen. <br>
<br>
Notes of interest: <br>
<br>
Cloud Scepter is your most valuable relic. Use it every turn, throwing away anything you don&#39;t immediately need. Cycle with it and the creature card drawing every turn. <br>
<br>
Once you start gaining control, use the Warrior&#39;s Boots and Relic Stalker at will. Recycling these will allow you to play them again and again for free energy with the Ring of Secrets. <br>
<br>
You don&#39;t have to steal everything. Generally, 2 turns of theft is good enough. When your opponent seems weak, start smashing. Focus on Shelling/Cycling every turn, gaining energy with Pharan, and killing off Magi. <br>
<br>
Play cautiously. Don&#39;t dump all your relics in play. Play what you need to steal their creatures. If something is huge, take it with the Dancer + Quill combo. Spend energy on card drawing and shelling first, then take the creature so it loses minimal energy if possible *sometimes I steal this way to just get the creature out of my way*, then use the Pharan + Narth to recharge. Again, don&#39;t dump all your creatures either. There is no reason to over extend yourself. Play what you need to hold an advantage, and go with that. Overkill is unessecary, risky, and often fatal when playing Aikido, or Aikido 2. <br>
<br>
There have been times when I got strange draws. I&#39;ve been known to go beat down on O&#39;Qua. An opening draw of 2 Spray Narth&#39;s and no relics usually convinces me to do so. Take a turn to draw some cards with a Conjure&#39;d Bubble Xyx. Conjure out a Hurricane Orish, play the Narth&#39;s for free, and begin the agression. Play a few universal relics *as not to hinder Voice&#39;s choice of relics* if possible and conjure out River Abaquists to steal opposing creatures. I had to resort to this in a tournament a few weeks ago against Arderial decks. It worked out good both times I did, allowing me to kill Delia once, and Delia + Sorreah another with a well timed Shell. I went into my power magi with their toughest magi defeated by my weakest, and was able to just overpower them easily at that point. <br>
<br>
Remember to be flexible. This deck has a lot of tricks to try and get you out of any bad situations that may arise. <br>
<br>
Once the cycle of Cycle/Shell/Pharan gets started, it&#39;s pretty much game. There&#39;s nothing you can really do against shell other than Rayje&#39;s Sword + mass damage spells. Even then, your guys should have some extra energy and manage just fine. If not, your opponent&#39;s depleted his resources, and you should be fine for a turn or two until you get out some more offense. <br>
<br>
After placing in the final 8 in the storyline tournament at Origins, with approximately 53 people enetered, I was quite pleased with this deck&#39;s performance and capability despite MRP&#39;s. However, the tactics of the deck have gone a new direction. In hindsight, this deck turned out to be a weaker version of the Construct-Combo deck that made an appearance, and dominated the tournies. That deck was my only loss in the rounds. No shame in this deck&#39;s performance at all, because there was very little anyone could do to beat it when played by Matt Loomis *who was my matchup in the rounds* or Chris Jilot, who won the Invitational on the following day. I conceded in the final 8 to a friend playing my other deck, Mydra Swarm Lockout, because he had a strong chance to defeat the Construct decks, whereas I had none at all. I was the top Orothe player of the day, and for that I was proud enough. I feel that without the other combo deck in the mix, I had a chance to take first place, as no one was prepared for this. And those that were prepared, the safties in the deck against counter strategies were sound in playtesting, giving me a means around all their possible solutions *that I could find*. <br>

Thanks for the positive responses, I&#39;m glad you guys like this version:) <br>
<br>
As for Inihitor Band, they have to draw it early, they have to play it, I have to _not_ draw my Beam of Light with O&#39;Qua or all the cards I can go through with Cloud Scepter. Then, I have to _need_ to play my universal relics. Notice that there are a good deal of Orothe/Arderial Relics. <br>
<br>
As for Karak jewelery being my most valuable relic... did you even bother to read what this deck does? Do you understand that you can only use them ONCE a turn _if_ I steal something? Cloud Scepter lets me cycle my deck every turn so I can Shell every turn, or draw anything I need. I designed this deck, and _I_ _know_ what the most valuable Relic is after having played it for 3 weeks now. Thanks. <br>
<br>
I know this isn&#39;t anything original, but I never claimed it was. I was just posting the deck I played that got me to the final 8 in the storyline before I conceded to a friend cuz he had a shot at beating the combo decks I couldn&#39;t beat. I think Aikido 2 had a shot at first place, but I played it safe and let the better deck for the situation advance. I can&#39;t say I would&#39;ve won, so don&#39;t think I am. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font class="bfont"> <a href="/magination/decks/decks.php">Back to Decks Directory</a> | <A HREF="/magination/decks/decks.php?reviews=24314"> Read Reviews </A> | <a href="deckprint.php?deck=24314" TARGET="BLANK_"> Printer Friendly</a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="review"></a><font class="h2font">In order to review decks you must be a registered member. <A href="/magination/main/join.php">Sign up for free!</A></font></td></tr></table></td>
