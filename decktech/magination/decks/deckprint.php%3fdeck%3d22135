Total: 44 Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck contains no complex combos, just plain and simple beatdown from small weenie creatures.  Evu is there to set up your hand for Tryn, but try to survive on him for as long as possible, because more cards = bigger advantage once you reach Tryn and/or Pruitt. If you manage to get a Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel out with Evu, you will be able to cycle trough at least 4 cards of your deck each turn. Now im going to explain individual card choices below:<br>
<br>
Tree Hinko: There to aid you with Evu&#39;s low energize and Pruitt&#39;s Robe, which can get really useful if you have a 7 energize with Tryn or Pruitt.<br>
<br>
Parmalag: Save these guys for either Tryn or Pruitt, because you want to keep them alive for as long as possible. Theyre very useful especially against Kybar&#39;s Teeth, because it loses no energy in the attack if you shield.  Also used against Braggle, Vellup, and other misc. creatures.<br>
<br>
Nodj: There to eliminate small and annyoing creatures like Vellups and other Naroom weenie swarms.<br>
<br>
Rudwot: Starting for Tryn, semi-useful as well.<br>
<br>
Shockwave: Simple Creature elimination.<br>
<br>
Carillion: Starting for Pruitt, not bad a card either.<br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Sword: Anti KT and other energy loss prevention.<br>
<br>
Book of Life: There to recover Vortex of Knowledge and other spells once you have decent amounts of energy on Tryn or Pruitt. Don&#39;t play it with Evu.<br>
<br>
Plith: Evu Starting, nice card if you&#39;re on the defensive end of the game.<br>
<br>
Vortex of Knowledge: Evu starting, double edged sword. You gotta love it, and you gotta hate it. I&#39;ve experienced both ends of the spectrum, where it was the card that brought me victory or let my opponent draw that card that finally was able to destry me.<br>
<br>
Tillant: Anti-Core, decent card too.<br>
<br>
Pruitt&#39;s Robe: Very nice card, one of my favorite relics in the game.<br>
<br>
Beam of Light: Additional Relic eliminaiton, also useful for clearing the table of the small weenie hordes the opponent drops on the table.<br>
<br>
Energy Band: Very sweet card, I love it. It&#39;s great for overpowering the opponent&#39;s creatures.<br>
<br>
Vinoc: Pruitt starting, I use the ability very often, when I have extra cards in my hand to spare.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel: Helps a lot early on to cycle through the deck when you still have Evu out. It helps with the 2 girls later on, as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was thinking about removing a few cards like the Book oes and maybe some creatures and other relics, but I&#39;ll wait and see what advice I get from you.<br>
Thanks and enjoy the deck </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
