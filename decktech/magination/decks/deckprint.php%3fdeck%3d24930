Total: 40 + 3 Magi   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is essentially a reformed version of Akido(originally created by Van Russel). Instead of relying on relics to power my deck, I also use many creatures to bust a hole through my opponent as well. Though I don&#39;t usually play 3 River Abaquists a turn, I do play things that combat against &quot;small creature&quot; or swarm decks. More creatures in the deck makes it less viable to losing to a random Spell Pulse or a Vaporize. And now that inhibitor band is SO good, I don&#39;t think that Van&#39;s &quot;Pile-kido&quot; deck could stand up to the current environment. I do believe, however, that my deck could, and has. I have playtested it against the best of decks. The only one it seems to have trouble against is the infamous &quot;infinterchange&quot; deck that has shown up in recent tournaments. And that mainly because shell doesn&#39;t protect my creatures(they change magi and shell is eratta&#39;d to target a magi). This fact makes my debate whether or not I should play it in the current environment. Though I DO think that if I set up correctly, I can really pound the &quot;Infinterchange&quot; deck. But about 65% of the time, I lose. These aren&#39;t good stats! Especially if he can keep me on O&#39;qua long enough. Most of the time I can just conjure a nalo to kill O&#39;qua, but if he has a Rayje&#39;s Belt, then I am hurtin&#39; really badly! I also put one equilibrate in my deck to combat those massive swarms from &quot;new bograth&quot; that have like 6-7 creatures that are atleast 4 energy in size! Then I usually just cast a nalo and kill their magi(which is usually Grahnna). I was debating on whether or not to put Phrups in this deck, seeing as I don&#39;t gain energy on Voice of the Storm for them. But essentially the deck has the same strategy as Akido. I play creatures and relics that benefit me in stealing opposing cards. Then I apesmash them! Therefore I came up with the name Smash-kido! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
