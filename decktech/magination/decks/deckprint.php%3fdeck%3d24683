<b>Basic Rundown</b><br>
<br>
This deck has alot of tiny creatures,why little you ask? To annoy,add to River Abas power and many other things. The Healing spells are there to pump them up if needed,the deck idea is to steal anything you can,but mainly big beefy creatures to use against themselfs.<br>
<br>
<b>Magi Rundown</b><br>
<br>
<font color="Aqua">O&#39;qua</font><br>
<br>
Once again we see this magi,because she works and does what&#39;s best for starting this deck,there is not much really to do with her other than Conjore as many bubbles and draw as many cards(Sorreah&#39;s dream is also good here.) till she dies or sacrifice her.<br>
<br>
<font color="Aqua">Voice of the Storms</font><br>
<br>
VotS is the beatdown magi of this deck,at first glance she seemed not good at all...till I opened my eyes. First grab the H. Orish and any Orothe or Ardernial relic (if you didn&#39;t get the Quill,DO SO NOW!).<br>
<br>
Start playing all the relics you have,but don&#39;t use the Forgotten dance if you have one...since remeber that FD does discard Energy...so play all the 1 energy you have,Then Pop Forgotten Dance to steal their biggest creature,and throw in another if there is another creature to steal.<br>
Do all the stealing you can with her...but if she falls...<br>
<br>
<font color="Aqua">Arosa</font><br>
<br>
It&#39;s time for Arosa! Hopefully you will have shuffled though your deck by now, So you have a fresh start with her, Not much to say other than try to steal all you can,but now that you don&#39;t have Forgotten dance+Quill You&#39;ll have to resort to River Abaquist and a swarm of weenies, Or alot of relics if you can steal them all.<br>
<br>
<b>Why I play do/don&#39;t play some cards</b><br>
This deck is pretty new and hasn&#39;t played many games...so alot of it is testing and so.<br>
<br>
Climbing staff:<br>
<br>
I may put these in, but depends on what the people are playing most in my area.<br>
<br>
Bwill:<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s face it, noone wants to attack it,cause it&#39;s like a drush...maybe not as good but a lot cheaper.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll put more up soon as I test it more.<br>
<br>
<b>Final Thoughts</b><br>
<br>
Fun deck,defently a twist to Theif type decks in a way. Untill later...<br>
