&quot;Minion&#39;s Awakening&quot;<br>
By: Core Minion   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck uses the five shadow geysers and Awakening. If done right, you will defeat all your opponents in a single blow.<br>
<br>
First, we have Evil Evu as a draw engine. Keeping Evil Evu alive is CRUCIAL. You have to make sure that you have drawn the right cards, but are able to defend. Use Chaos Pliths and Dream Rifts to draw cards like crazy. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll have a Secrets of the Book that you can use to draw even more cards. <br>
<br>
Here are the cards that you&#39;ll need to set up Warrada for the final blow:<br>
<br>
all five Shadow Geysers<br>
Awakening<br>
Cataclysm<br>
Thunderquake<br>
Wudge (all 3)<br>
at least 3 different relics<br>
at least 3 different spells<br>
6 other core cards<br>
<br>
To stay alive, you can use Shadow Cloaks for defense, Chaos Spheres to get rid of their creatures, Dark Furok to attack, and Drush to retaliate.<br>
<br>
Once you have all your cards, no worries! (at least not probably.) Don&#39;t play any of these cards at all until Evil Evu is defeated.<br>
<br>
When Evil Evu is defeated, we pull out Mobis. This may seem dumb since Mobis is Orothe and we don&#39;t have any Orothe cards. First, we use a Thunderquake against the opposing magi. Make X cost 9. This will make a regional penalty of 1, so in reality it will cost 10. Then, we play a Cataclysm. This costs 10, so it will take 11, killing Mobis while discarding the opponent&#39;s(s&#39;) hand(s). (This may seem stupid because of Thunderquake and Cataclysm used together. The point is to discard the opposing hands--hopefully they&#39;re not Arderial or Core--and kill off Mobis.) <br>
<br>
When Mobis is defeated, he adds three energy to your next magi, Warrada. This allows Warrada to carry out the plan almost uninterrupted. She will start with 25 energy (from Dark Blooming plus Mobis&#39;s effect) .<br>
<br>
1. We play the three Wudges. This is a setup to play the Naroom Geyser. Now Warrada has 22 energy.<br>
<br>
2. Play the Arderial Shadow Geyser. This causes you to discard three spells. Make sure you keep the 5 geysers and Awakening. The Arderial Shadow Geyser causes all the opposing geysers to cost 1 less. Now Warrada will have 17 energy.<br>
<br>
3. Play the Cald Shadow Geyser. Since your Wudges have no power, they don&#39;t lose any energy from this geyser&#39;s effect. Now Warrada will have 13 energy. (The Cald Shadow Geyser will cost one less)<br>
<br>
4. Play the Naroom Shadow Geyser.  Now you will discard all three Wudges. This spell will cost zero, as Warrada is a Naroom Shadow Magi. Warrada now has 13 energy.<br>
<br>
5. Now you play 3 relics. Make sure these are relics with no energy cost. Then, play the Orothe Shadow Geyser. This will make you discard all 3 relics. Now Warrada is left with 9 energy.<br>
<br>
6. Now, we play the Underneath Shadow Geyser. This will require you to have 6 core cards in your hand and discard them. Now Warrada has 5 energy.<br>
<br>
6. Now you play Awakening and laugh at your opponents. Warrada is left with 4.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
If you are missing one of the shadow geysers or Awakening when Warrada is revealed, use a Tomes of the Great Library to get the card. Warrada will still be left with 1.<br>
<br>
Flaws in the deck:<br>
As I have found several flaws in the deck, I would be very much appreciative in ways I could improve it.<br>
Some of the flaws are:<br>
- against Storm of Fishes, this will discard all the spells in my hand.<br>
<br>
- Abraxin&#39;s Crown. This sucks if you use Cataclysm and then they reveal that they have an Abraxin&#39;s Crown and taunt you for the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
- Trug. This could kill off Evil Evu immediately before he can draw all the cards.<br>
<br>
- Collar of Despair. This could inhibit Warrada&#39;s ability to finish off the magi if she needs to use Tomes of the Great Library.<br>
<br>
- Riptide. This could stop Mobis from being able to use Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
If there are any other flaws, point them out to me and please help me fix them. Also please help me fix some of the above flaws.<br>
<br>
Finally, we all know Core decks will have trouble with Core Hunters. Please do not rate my deck based on the fact that it is Core.<br>
