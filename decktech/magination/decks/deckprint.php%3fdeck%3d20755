Uncommonly Naroom<br>

Get big fast. The deck does this but has some quirks. <br>
<br>
First is the magi oder. Tiller is th main draw engine. He will discard creatures and relics whose use is not needed to draw cards. It is best to keep the weebo in hand just in case you pull a forrest hyren. <br>
<br>
Second is the magi order. This is always important to any deck. Tiller goes first to provide a draw engine and to fight off at least one magi. Pruitt adds energy and becomes an attacking power with her pruitt&#39;s robe. Tryn is the standard clean up magi who can just add two free energy. With a forrest hyren and weebo in play, she become quite potent.<br>
<br>
Next are the tweeves. They are a free 3 energy creature if you draw them outside of your first turn. If you draw them with tiller, you can discard them to draw cards.<br>
<br>
The rayje&#39;s cards are to keep pesky effects from debilitating your attack power.<br>
<br>
Pruitt&#39;s robe is there for pruitt and so that any magi can add that five energy for a crucial attack.<br>
<br>
Bungaloo is a cheep defence that replenishes the lost energy.<br>
<br>
Eebit is there to just be the pests of Naroom.<br>
<br>
Giant Carillion is a shockwave and a two energy creature aftwerwards. With a weebo in play, they can recharge for a second stomp next turn.<br>
<br>
Tillant is provided to defeat pesky core cards and it is also a 6 energy creature that sits for attacks and defence.<br>
<br>
Weebos play a more important role in this Naroomian eco-system than in any other I have ever made. Weebos provide a re-vamp in energy to the forrest hyren and giant carillion.<br>
<br>
Forrest hyren is the star of the deck. You are best to only play it with a weebo so that you can use its power on weebo and then weebo&#39;s power on forrest hyren. You now have a 7 energy weebo and a 10 energy forrest hyren(from its effect).Tiller works best to draw the main attraction.<br>
<br>
Get big. Get big fast. This deck puts Miracal Grow in a whole new perspective. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
