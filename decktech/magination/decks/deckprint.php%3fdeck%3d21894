Total: 40 Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is fairly simple, so those of you new to the game should have an easy time picking it up. basically your goal is to have more energy than your opponents creatures, and attack. plain and simple.<br>
<br>
EVU: Evu is the only rare card in the deck, (I think?) and is not totally a key part either. You can replace him with Tryn if you like, I just like him because i think he&#39;s cool, and his quote is just trippy, especally if you are a big jellybean eater like myself. Keep saying to your opponent as you eat your jellybeans out of your bag, &quot;Give me enough time, and enough jellybeans, and I&#39;ll have the answer.&quot; Evu is used to draw cards to get card advantage on your opponent fast. Go first if you can to take advantage of the Plith. After your first turn, you should have some useful spells in hand you can use on your opponent such as tap roots, grow, etc. When evu goes down, you should have plenty of cards in hand for Yaki. This is where the real fun starts.<br>
<br>
YAKI: Try to save a robe for Yaki of you can, it can really help you gain momentum quickly. Pull all his cards, get the energy advantage and beat your opponent down. Twice! Vinocs can be especially useful if you have a lot of cards in hand to discard (thanks to evu)<br>
<br>
PRUITT: When Yaki goes down, out comes Pruitt. Pruitt may be found in the starter deck, but DO NOT take her lightly. Between her robe and the refresh power, you can add 8 energy to a creature in one turn! For fun try to pump a Vinoc to 20E. Start with your energy, play vinoc, discard some other cards you don&#39;t need. Hopefully this will get him up to at least 6. Then play your grow and a tap roots if you have it, hopefully that will put him to 12 (or higher). Next, use Pruitt robe, add 5 to Vinoc, and refresh. Look! you got 20E! Now, don&#39;t forget you can keep adding 8 to it each turn with the robe and refresh power. What fun!<br>
<br>
This deck is for those new to the game only, and can teach you how the game is played. Some more power rares can be added to spice it up to the advanced level, if need be, but this works to show you mechanics of the game. Most of all, remember to have fun and experiment. You don&#39;t learn anything by not trying new things. Good luck, and most of all have fun :P </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
