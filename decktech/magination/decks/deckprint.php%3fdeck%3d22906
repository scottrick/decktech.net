The take-over itself feeds your draw engine, with the Karak Necklaces. <br>
  O&#39;Qua is there merely for setup.  She uses her Conjure to summon up the Bubble Xyx&#39;s, and basically stalls to draw cards.  9 times out of 10, you will NOT want to Interchange using Giant Parathin, because you will NEED Quilla&#39;s starting relics.  Once Quilla gets out, you should have a Karak Necklace, Band, and Hubdra&#39;s Cube.  If they have a relic, take it, period.  More food for Quilla.  Taking a relic you don&#39;t have is better, because having more relics out helps you with your river abaquists.  Optimally, within a turn or two, Quilla should have control of your opponents army, and then you start dropping the Phrups and Wellisks.  Use Corathan to keep getting the necessary cards back, and the Karak Necklaces will let you have half your deck in your hand or more within a turn or two.  If you feel confident enough, it may be a good idea to use Interchange to switch to Arosa, even if you&#39;re winning.  Use her shell game to gain control of a creature, and you get free energy and cards.  All-in-all, a most annoying prospect for your opponent.<br>

Metagame Possibilities<br>
<br>
Mirror Match:  It becomes a race for the energy advantage.  If one player manages to achieve it, they should win.  It comes down to who gets the right draw at the right time, nothing else.<br>
<br>
Core:  Chur first will severely hamper this deck.  Other than that, even Core can&#39;t keep up with this much card stealing, and if it tries the same, the Karak Necklaces give you the advantage.<br>
<br>
Creatureless Cald:  Since no one around here plays this, i&#39;m not worried, but it would give this deck major problems, i think.<br>
<br>
Standard Cald:  Simply take the Ergars and Braggles, and watch Cald fizzle.  They have enough energy disadvantage as it is, without there own energy being thrown back at them.<br>
<br>
Swarm (Arderial, Bograth, Weave, etc.): I teched in the Deep Hyren simply for this reason.  I have no room for the Last Words.  Between the Deep and Reef Hyrens, i can usually handle swarm in combat.  Plus there low energy makes them easy take-over targets.<br>
<br>
Big Freakin Creatures (aka KT and Hyren Decks):  The Undertows and Wellisks can usually handle this, simply Conjure Wellisks with O&#39;Qua, to get the early advantage.<br>
<br>
Dark Twins: This is always a game time decision.  If i know i might face the DT, or think the possibility is good, I tech in a Hunter Jile.  Otherwise, i leave it out to save deck space.  As long as i get a decent draw with O&#39;Qua, the DT are usually no problem.<br>
<br>
Well, there you have it folks.  I&#39;m open to suggestions.  Note, i have thought Long and Hard about the card selections and quantity.  A lot of cards i didn&#39;t throw in simply because almost everything in the deck i felt i Needed.  So if you&#39;re gonna say &quot;throw this in&quot;, please give a GOOD reason.  Thanks<br>

This is simply my version of it.) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
