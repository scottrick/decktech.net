<br>
Evil Evu: Awesome for drawing, every card of theres you take out, you draw one. <br>
<br>
Ogar: Now that you have an awesome hand from Evil Evu, play all of your Wudges, Uggers, and Szalaks. Anything extra you might have in your hand. <br>
<br>
Morag: Steals relics with a high energize and starting. Perfect for a good last magi take down. <br>
<br>
- - - - - - - <br>
<br>
Dark Furok: Starting<br>
<br>
Chaos Plith: Starting<br>
<br>
Chaos Jile: Starting<br>
<br>
Grubble: Get two and pull out a Gorath or Nightbreed, great for a sudden surprise.  <or if your playing another core and they play one grubble, you can use that one with yours><br>
<br>
Zungg: Whats not to like? <br>
<br>
Wudge: Great for energy. Especialy with Ogar pumping you, hurting them <br>
<br>
Gorath: Absolutely awesome with Shadow Bones. <br>
<br>
Core Grag: To take alot of energy off of them. Works great for there Magi so you can finish the beat down. <br>
<br>
Dark Ayebaw: Drawing with Evil Evu also leaves you with a wide variety of cards.. And cards in general. Just get rid of the cards that aren&#39;t going to help you this time for increased damage. If they aren&#39;t using Ardarial Guard Wings then just sock the sword. Got a hand full of awesome spells? Sock the mind blank. This is by far one of the best core cards hehe <br>
<br>
Ugger: Great for attacking.. Simply put. You use your awesome 21 Szalak, slay there Colossus. Attack with Ugger, move the extra 9 energy from your Szalak and take out there other Colossus. Out of attacking creatures? There magi only at 7 but you Ugger is a 3? Pitch in 4 energy from an extra and finish the job. <br>
<br>
Nightbreed Hyren: Take control of there Hyrens. If need be, use the bones so you keep the Nightbreed big and ready for another steal. <br>
<br>
- - - - - - - <br>
<br>
Blight: To turn your 2&#39;s into 3&#39;s. Your 1&#39;s into 2s. Works great with Ogar after you&#39;ve layed your mass mini army. Also to turn there 4&#39;s into 2&#39;s. There 2&#39;s under a tomb stone. <br>
<br>
Vaporize: They packing an army of annoying relics? Can&#39;t stand all of those Orothe tricks? Just throw this out and crush them. Take some energy off of there magi as a bonus to. <br>
<br>
Corrupt: Got the upper-hand in creatures? Just sock this baby down and keep it that way! Just defeated there first magi with a little corrupted Evu? Throw this out so they can&#39;t play a creature without you making gain and them loss. <br>
<br>
Turn: Just an awesome card. Take control of there 3&#39;s and 4&#39;s with Morag&#39;s normal energize. If you&#39;ve been saving up, poke that Forest Hyren in the eyes with a Zungg and corrupt it while it&#39;s not looking. <br>
<br>
- - - - - - - <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Belt: For those irritating powers and effects you just HAVE to get rid of! <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Sword: For there energy preventers so your Blights, Core Grags, and Dark Ayebaws can get the job done. <br>
<br>
Warrior&#39;s Boots: Speed is good.  <br>
<br>
Shadow Bones: Turns Gorath from 10 to 20 and Nightbreed from 11 to 22. Just a great card in general. <br>
<br>
This is the redone version, tell me what you think and I&#39;l continue you this until I come out with a good deck <even though whoever posted the alterations was rather stupid, &quot;why did you put relic mirrors in!!  That was your first mistake!!  Because I only have ONE rayje&#39;s belt in the deck!  Only ONE rayje&#39;s sword!  Relic mirror can save you under the right conditions, and, Loaded Dice is for Szalak!!  You always make an energy gain that way!  It&#39;s a great combo!  No point in having a suicidal creature if he&#39;s going to -pop- and you lose it all because you didn&#39;t have some loaded dice!!  <thoughts from zet><br>

<br>
Ohh, note:  Korg&Zet are the greatest magi.  Ask anyone I&#39;ve played..  You just have to use them right.  Turns can be played easily, you have energy!!  I&#39;m surprised that just doesn&#39;t phase anyone.  Just play a Zungg and turn there biggest creature.  They can attack and do whatever they want but in the end they get nothing out of it because you do it all over again.  And, all of there creatures are now damaged on trying to take out your biggest, play your extra turn and take there biggest again, at full energy.  Keep this up and you drown there magi.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  It&#39;s not even hard after you gain control.  Just survive the first two turns and you&#39;ve pretty much won the game. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
