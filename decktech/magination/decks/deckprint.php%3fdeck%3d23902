As a Region, Arderial was the first Region I truely felt comfortable with when learning to play Magi-Nation Duel. <I>The Arderial</I> was one of my first solid, tournanament-level, decks. While this version bares almost nothing to it&#39;s eariler incarnations, I take great pride in it. <I>The Arderial</I>&#39;s main concept has always been some kind of disruption lead followed by a Xyx Swarm generated by Ora in the back slot. While the disruption method has varied version to version, I have always tried to make the best use of what ever disruption method I chose.<BR><br>
While Nightmare&#39;s Dawn has given Arderial decks some new versitally and tools, only one spell has entered the deck: Sandswril. I&#39;ll touch on it in the Spells Section.<br>
<B>How does the deck work?</B><BR><br>
The 6.3 version of <I>The Arderial</I> works around some concepts that I saw discused in a article on DT concerning the use of Sorreah as a finishing Magi and Cataclysm as the opening door to win with. While in concept this sounds good, I felt Sorreah worked well as a mid-slot Magi and had been using him in the mid-slot for <I>The Arderial</I> since Awakening has been out. In that article, the author proposed a deck using Delia/Ora/Sorreah for Magi and basing the deck around a Vellup/Xyx Swarm supported by Shockwaves, Storm Clouds, and Cataclysms. Most of the Spell elements and the Xyx elements I had already been working with, so it wasn&#39;t hard to retool the deck to work with this kind of theme.<BR><br>
The early part of play revolves around keeping at least one Elder Vellup cycling Creautres out of your deck and into hand by allowing one Elder Vellup to die either in Creature Combat or by an Opponent&#39;s card, Recurring Dreams it back into hand <I>(usually durring your 1st P/S/R)</I>, and then playing either the retrived one or playing another Elder Vellup you should have. While your doing this, your Vellups should be able to aid in the deck&#39;s defence. I realize that you can&#39;t spend the 6E every turn to keep a Elder Vellup cycled. All that you have to do is cycle an Elder Vellup as often as you can.<BR><br>
Hopefully within 4 to 5 turns, you should of cleared several additional Creatures out of the deck, through the Elder Vellups, into your hand, as well as through your regular draws. I would recommend going for a Xyx or a Xyx Minor with the Elder Vs first. They are nice for Setting up for Sorreah.<BR><br>
Part of this deck relies on you <B>not</B> to play too many Spells early. This is improtamt as to allow you to get a Cataclysm when Sorreah comes up. Play your Spells with care. That way you may only need to grab one Arderial Spell <I>(Outside of a Sorreah&#39;s Dream)</I> from the discard pile and a much needed Cataclysm from the deck. If the way the match is going forces you to play a mulitiude of Spells, that&#39;s ok. Just keep recurring out either Vellups or Elder Vellups and stall. Sorreah, Cataclysm, and a well placed Xyx Shock <I>should</I> be able to take out a Magi out right. Finally, Ora and her Xyx horde should work wonders with cleaning up whatever you will still have to face.<BR><br>
<B>The Magis</B><BR><br>
Delia - In either case <I>(going First or Second)</I>, just grab a Vellup and 4 random cards. I&#39;ve had decent luck pulling either a Shockwave or Storm Cloud in the opening Draw. As your playing out the Velup stuff, Don&#39;t necessarly get all three Vellups & one Elder Vellup. You might just wish to grab 2 Vellups & the Elder Vellup. That way you can always recycle one of the Vellups, if it get&#39;s taken out on the opponent&#39;s turn, to grab the remaining Vellup <I>(and with it the another Elder Vellup)</I> on the next turn. With the first Elder Vellup, I usually go for a regular Xyx or a Lovian. That way I&#39;ve got something for later <I>(Xyx)</I> or something that will that I&#39;ll have as a secondary defensive measure <I>(Lovian)</I>.<BR><br>
Sorreah - Pretty much most of what I intend with Sorreah is mentioned above. But What I usually do when Sorreah flips <I>and</I> I&#39;m able to pull a Catty is this:<br>
1) Drop Catty in your 1st P/S/R<br>
2) Then drop a Xyx Minor & a Xyx in Play Creatures<br>
3) Sorreah&#39;s Dream Gathring Clouds (to the Minor)<br>
4) Use the Minor&#39;s own Gathering Clouds on the Xyx<br>
5) Use Shock<br>
If the opposing Magi is at 4E or less <I>(and doesn&#39;t have a Climbing Staff handy)</I> you&#39;ll be taking out a Magi and still have 2 - 4E Creatures in play.<br>
The other thing I like about having Sorreah in the Mid-slot is I&#39;ve found several decks like working with the Mid-Magi&#39;s Powers & Effects. With Sorreah in the Mid-slot, I&#39;m screwing up that idea, which is apart of the deck&#39;s concept.<br>
If you can&#39;t get a Cataclysm with Sorreah, don&#39;t worry. Do the best you can to take out the current Magi and try and get the cataclysm for Ora and attempt the above.<BR><br>
Ora - While she doesn&#39;t seem to be the most powerfull of clean-up Magi, she has been able to win games for me with no difficulity. Always try and hold on to a Xyx and Sorreah&#39;s Dream, in addition to one extra Xyx Minor for when Ora comes up. That way you have options to potentially take out a Magi when she flips up.<BR><br>
<B>The Creatures</B><BR><br>
The three non-Vellup or non-Xyx Creatures might seem a little odd for this deck, but I think they fill out the Creature compliment nicely...<BR><br>
Ayebaw - I&#39;ve started facing simular decks to mine with a couple carring Ayebaws in them. I will admit Booting in a Ayebaw with a Storm Ring out can serve quite nicely, especially if I have the Energy to do that and then play Cry of Thunder.<br>
Brannix - 5E and capable of gaining energy when it attacks Creatures, it works. A good offensive Creature to compliment the deck.<BR><br>
Lovian - It&#39;s Resistance Effect is the main reason Lovian is in the deck currently.<BR><br>
<B>The Spells</B><BR><br>
I think most of the Spells in the deck are pretty straight forward to understand as to why they are in the deck, but I thought I&#39;d spotlight a couple...<BR><br>
Sorreah&#39;s Dream - No matter what, <B>always</B> remember to grab a Sorreah&#39;s Dream when Sorreah filps up. Not only is it usefull with any of the Xyx family, but with any non-self referencing Power your Opponent might have in play. Also remember, that you can grab one Sorreah&#39;s Dream as a regular Starting card for Sorreah, but that you could also grab the other copy that&#39;s in the deck as one of the &#39;Any two Arderial Spells&#39; he starts with as well.<BR><br>
Cry of Thunder - Why this Spell instead of Solar Flare? It combos nicely with the Xyx family, as well as it&#39;s one of those Spells that You want to hold onto until just the right moment.<br>
Lightning and Shooting Star - Outside of the fact that they are decent staple Spells, I bet your wondering why I have them in here? Shooting Star is a Starting card for both Delia and Ora. While I usually do not grab it with Delia, I would rather have the optiion availabe to me, if needed. The Lightnings are nice for a little for either Creature damage against opposing Creatures or for boosting my Creatures, if I need it.<BR><br>
SandSwril - I usually view Sandswril as a temporary Rayje&#39;s Belt. Use it only on a Creature or Magi your sure about taking out. Not only does the Creature or Magi loose the use of their abilities, but thy take an extra damage in attacks for the duriation of the Spell.<BR><br>
<B>The Relics</B><BR><br>
I think all of the relics are pretty much self-explainatory as to why they are in the deck.<BR><br>
<B>Other Things</B><BR><br>
I still haven&#39;t decided about adding either a third Storm Ring or a third Warrior&#39;s Boots. I&#39;ve also thought about working in a couple of Tommorow&#39;s Jewels into the deck.<BR><br>
Now some of you may wonder why in the world I&#39;m not using Defender of the Sky <I>(alternate Ora)</I> instead of regular Ora. Part of it comes in the fact DotS is a 10/5 Magi. Granted the Adding 2E to a Xyx she plays is a great thing, I just cant justify it for 2 Less Starting Energy in this deck. The other is that DotS&#39;s Effect only works on Xyx&#39;s, nothing else. I&#39;ve had the ocassion where I&#39;ve had to drop a non-Xyx Creature, I&#39;d rather see it gain something as well than not. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
