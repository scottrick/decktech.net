<br>
O&#39;Qua: The strategy here is quite simple.  Draw cards.  You conjure Bubble Xyx&#39;s, and let her die.  Don&#39;t worry about defense.  As long as you have around 10-15 cards in your hand before she dies, you should be fine 9 times out of 10.  And whatever you do, DO NOT waste a Warrior&#39;s Boots or Deep Wellisk here or with Shaper&#39;s Apprentice.  You&#39;ll need them for later.<br>
<br>
Shaper&#39;s Apprentice: Sure he can bring back a Giant Parathin that O&#39;Qua used, but he can also bring back a Bubble Xyx that O&#39;Qua uses!  Simply play the Sea Barl that Shaper starts with, and another Bubble Xyx if you have it.  Use both, then use Dream Twist to discard the Sea Barl and bring back the used Bubble Xyx.  Don&#39;t worry about Shaper not lasting long, he&#39;s not supposed to.  If both O&#39;Qua and Shaper last 2 turns each, or a total of 4 turns, you should be GOLDEN.<br>
<br>
Obgren:  The meat of the deck.  Here&#39;s where all the action on YOUR part takes place.  You should have in your hand at least 2 of the following:  Creeping Chill, Bog Stench, Deep Wellisk, and Warrior&#39;s Boots.  First, you want to play the Staff of Keepers and name Orothe.  Then play the Robes of the Ages.  Then, if you have it, use Flood of Energy.  You&#39;ll need that extra 4 energy to make your first turn with Obgren an optimal one.  Don&#39;t worry about them getting energy.  It ain&#39;t gonna matter.  After that, Warrior&#39;s Boots out 2 Deep Wellisks.  Play as many Creeping Chills and Bog Stenches as you have.  Change the Bograth on Bog Stench to Kybar&#39;s Teeth with Obgren.  Do the same with the Creeping Chills IF (and this is a BIG if) you drew a Cleansing.  If not, change Bograth to Orothe.  If you drew a Cleansing, use it to Cleanse Deep Wellisk into a KT creature.  Do this AFTER you have played the Deep Wellisks, because you don&#39;t want to have to pay regional penalties for the Deep Wellisks OR for the rest of your creatures.  Then, you quite simply, ATTACK!!  Your Deep Wellisks will gain up to 72 energy for each attack, depending on how many Bog Stenches and Creeping Chills you played.  If facing more than 2-3 creatures, you probably will only want to play 2 each, and here&#39;s why.  Doing so will allow you to cast 2 key cards.  Entangle to prevent them from using garbage like Storm Cloud and Vim and Vigor and Equilibrate, and Will of Orothe.  If the Deep Wellisks are Kybar&#39;s Teeth, they will gain the 36-72 energy every time they are ATTACKED, as well as when they attack.  If the opponent has a swarm out, well, it&#39;s gonna get ugly.  After you have gone through your Creeping Chills and Bog Stenches, simply keep attacking, and start creating a lock with Phrups, Wellisks, and Reef Hyren.  You only need to protect your Deep Wellisks for a few turns while you set up, and you&#39;ve got it made.  You should be cycling your deck every couple of turns by now, so keeping up the supply of Phrups and Wellisks should not be a problem.<br>
<br>
Potential Problems<br>
Ninx vs. Obgren:  This i see as one of the biggest potential problems.  Considering how much Obgren depends on that first turn boost, i&#39;m not sure how well it would work.  I have yet to playtest against it, but i think you would just have to play Creature battle against Ninx until she is defeated, then start up the combo.  Feedback would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Energy Drainers such as Storm Clud, V&V, etc.: This is why having the Shells and entangles played early with Obgren is so key.  The Deep Wellisks must be untouchable while you&#39;re setting up the lock of Phrups and Wellisks.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m really interested in feedback on this deck, either through ratings or d-mail.  I put my decks in the Advanced section for a reason.  I expect only the best from my decks, so therefore i want them judged by the highest standard.  Please consider accordingly.  Thank you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
