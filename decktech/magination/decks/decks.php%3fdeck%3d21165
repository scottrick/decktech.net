TOTAL: 40 cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="h2font"> Strategy</Font></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="bfont"> The strategy behind the deck isn&#39;t very hard; the main goal is to just stay ahead in the Creature war, while holding energy on your Magi as best as possible; all of your Magi will start with 19+ energy in general, and that&#39;s a lot to play with, even for a Core deck. The key is using it well.<br />
<br />
KORG<br />
<br />
The golden boy..Everyone makes fun of him. He really isn&#39;t bad at all; he discards energy from your Creatures when you play them, true. He can&#39;t play with Wudges, a Core staple; also true. And he can&#39;t use Warrior&#39;s Boots.<br />
<br />
So?<br />
<br />
These are reasons he&#39;s first; you shouldn&#39;t be wasting your Boots early in the game, overall, because you can almost always fight it out anyway. Wudges, again, aren&#39;t necessarily an early game Creature; they&#39;re great early game, if they can&#39;t be dealt with, but they&#39;re just as frustrating later on, when you hold two or three and play them all at once.<br />
<br />
The deck also needs to be built with Korg in mind. That may spark some argument "if I focus on one Magi, and he&#39;s first, what happens when he&#39;s beaten?"..You can build with him in mind and not be crippled when he&#39;s defeated; there are a few simple principles. One, he has a lot of energy. Two, he gets the biggest drawback when he plays lots of Creatures. Therefore, three, he should try and play Spells when he can (but not just to do it, if there&#39;s an actual benefit).<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll notice this deck is a bit more Spell heavy than an average Core deck; Korg is partly why. All of the Magi have huge energize rates, relatively speaking, and can afford to play Spells, plus many of these Spells are combat-oriented (it should be noted for beginners that Turn, unlike most "gain control of" Spells, will let you attack with the Creature you stole that turn). If you&#39;re going into the game planning on winning through combat, you might as well be ready for it.<br />
<br />
ZET<br />
<br />
Zet...My favorite Core Magi. It took both Warrada and Hrada to take him down and claim Agram&#39;s throne; remember that. Because of Good Riddance, Zet will start with 21 energy, and probably have a good bit of cards Korg couldn&#39;t even consider playing, namely Wudges and Boots; now&#39;s your chance to use them if you need to. You&#39;ll also have a fresh Turn in hand, and Treachery at your disposal, a very deadly Power, if used correctly.<br />
<br />
But most people don&#39;t use it correctly; they flip Zet over and think "Wow, Night Hyren!" and dump 13 energy into stealing it, getting an 8 energy Creature, only to have it Shockwaved next turn. You have to consider energy spenditure; fundamental economics. At the most basic level, you&#39;re paying 4 energy to discard an opposing Core Creature from play, 5 for a non-Core. Why? Because the X, you get back in Creature form.<br />
<br />
The problem in all of this is the X. Let&#39;s say the opponent had a six energy Furok and you revealed Zet. You energize, take your starting cards, and play a Grax and a Koil, for 10 energy. Zet now has 11 left. You spend 10 of that 11 to gain control of the Furok; because it&#39;s non-Core, it loses 1, and you end the turn with 15 energy in play, having discarded 6 from the opposing side, and payed 20 to do it. Look, you gained an advantage of 1.<br />
<br />
Treachery is, well, tricky. (Excuse the pun.) You have to look at it as combining two action into one; Shockwaving a Creature and playing one. Then, once you look at it like that, if the energy spent is worth the result, then feel free to use it; it is a very useful tool for removing blockers in the case of an emergency, and remember, as a Power, if you do something like grab a Burrowed Creature that has already lost 2 energy that turn, it won&#39;t lose any more. <br />
<br />
MORAG<br />
<br />
The guy who brought Agram back; he&#39;s a beast purely for his energize rate, and if that weren&#39;t enough, he has a solidly useful Power on top of it. His starting cards aren&#39;t the greatest, and that Borgor is really appealing to throw out there and start splitting hairs with, but you&#39;ve come too far to start screwing up now.<br />
<br />
Theft can be another difficult one to use; it&#39;s also tempting to go snatching Relics just so you can tinker with them, but, you&#39;ve got the basics of the game down, it&#39;s time to move on and keep thinking strategically. Is a Relic going to hamper your combat ability, either by adding energy to opposing Creatures, removing it from yours, or otherwise just messing with the way you attack? Then, yes, you&#39;ll probably want to grab it, not only gaining the advantage, but most importantly denying the opponent of it. Another problem is knowing how long to Theft something; if you don&#39;t really fear the Relic, but want to use it for your benefit this turn (and if they happen to have a discardable Relic out their, by all means grab it and trash the thing), feel free. Just remember that, if you want to use the Relic on successive turns, you have to spend odd amounts of energy; two turns, 3, three turns, 5, etc. That&#39;s also one turn you deny it from the opponent, and if it truly becomes frustrating enough, they will have to use their own resources to deal with it, best case scenario, Stalking their own Relic. You&#39;re out a little energy, they&#39;re out two cards, and, more importantly, probably one of their few ways to handle your Relics.<br />
<br />
You can also use it on Relics you want to protect; if you happened to have a Shadow Cloak, you could replace the Shryque with it, and hold it for Morag. Morag, interestingly enough, can use Theft on his own Relics. What does this do? It will bounce it back to your hand at the end of X turns; if it&#39;s a Relic that sticks around and you don&#39;t want destroyed, then they can&#39;t get rid of it if they can&#39;t make you discard it from your hand, all for one extra energy per turn (no big deal for Morag).<br />
<br />
***ADVANCED***<br />
<br />
Speaking of the Shadow Cloak, there&#39;s also this avanced rule called &#39;card memory&#39;. What Shadow Cloak does is allow you to pay 2 energy to make all of your Core Creatures immune to everything but Core Powers and Spells, very deadly because, well, Core has a hard time discarding Creatures outside of combat (something almost every other region excels at). The drawback? You can&#39;t use Shadow Cloak two turns in a row. However, when you Theft it for 1, and return it to your hand, the real fun begins, because it "forgets" that it was the same Shadow Cloak that was in play last turn. Basically, it&#39;s too much to have to remember that a card in your hand can have so many things affecting it that you just have to remember, so it&#39;s simply ignored, and when you play the Cloak next turn, you can use its Power all over again. End result? Morag energizes for four and his Creatures are immune to non-Core Spells and Powers.<br />

<br />
FINAL NOTES:<br />
<br />
A lot of the cards should explain themselves, but, just in case:<br />
<br />
SHRYQUE<br />
<br />
Shryque isn&#39;t a bad investment for two energy, and if it can stick around, is a little terror if you manage to empty your hand. It&#39;s also a cheap Creature, something Core is generally lacking on; shouldn&#39;t be played by Korg.<br />
<br />
BORGOR<br />
<br />
Again, we get into economics; is it worth the price of admission. You pay 6 energy to cleave two Creatures; if that doesn&#39;t discard 6+ energy, you&#39;re losing on your investment. Remember, worst case scenario, you can target your own Creature (and you&#39;ll have to if they only have one in play), and the Borgor is usually a good choice, since it&#39;ll usually have 2 energy then and just lose 1.<br />
<br />
KOIL<br />
<br />
Careful with Koil; try not to play it when the opponent is defenseless, for starters, or you&#39;ll lose one energy instead, and if they have a Burrowed Creature, go ahead and hit it, since Nightmare&#39;s an Effect, the point won&#39;t count against the Burrow protection. There is rarely a case when you won&#39;t want to use Re-Koil on yourself, so, as a general rule, do it.<br />
<br />
SHADOW VINOC<br />
<br />
Relics are getting much more popular in the modern environment; Shadow Vinoc is your solution. At the very least, he can get +1 from your Secrets, and if you have something like a Shadow Bones to play but don&#39;t need the energy before your Attack Step, just to "refresh" a Creature after combat, go ahead and throw it out there to help the Vinoc as well. These usually come out at 6+ energy; I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re played as little as they are.<br />
<br />
CHAOS PLITH<br />
<br />
Not much needs to be said here; defeat something, attacking or defending, even if the Plith is defeated as well, draw a card.<br />
<br />
CORE GRAG<br />
<br />
Most often, you&#39;ll probably use these for Firestorm than Creature combat, but they can fight in a pinch (and can&#39;t Firestorm if Korg plays them). As long as you&#39;ll discard at least five energy from the opposing side, then you&#39;re doing just fine with this card.<br />
<br />
DARK FUROK<br />
<br />
Revile is another tricky ability to use; it&#39;s great against those Burrowed Creatures, again, since it&#39;s an Effect, but it can backfire if you defeat their last Creature with your Furok; you&#39;ll have to Revile one of your own Creatures. So, whenever possible, attack with all of your Dark Furoks first.<br />
<br />
GRAX<br />
<br />
Tendril costs four. They don&#39;t have an 8+ energy Creature? Don&#39;t waste the resources, unless it&#39;s to do something game breaking (i.e., winning).<br />
<br />
WUDGE<br />
<br />
Little thought needs to go into this, just remember to play Wudges first, then your other Creatures, so they&#39;ll get the benefit. (Many beginners mistakingly play all of their Creatures at once; this isn&#39;t really how it works, it&#39;s sequential. You discard the energy to play one Creature, play it, add its energy, then repeat for each other one you wish to play.)<br />
<br />
SECRETS OF THE BOOK<br />
<br />
This is a little tricky to use; if you draw one card with it, then you didn&#39;t lose anything, the average card costs 2 energy to draw, plus you paid 1 to look at their hand. It&#39;s probably not worth the risk if they have less than three cards in their hand unless it&#39;s a heavy Creature deck, unless you really want to know what they&#39;ve got. Another common mistake when using Secrets is to just count their Creatures and Naroom cards and let them have it back; don&#39;t. Make them lay their hand on the table, and look over everything in your hand, in play, and everywhere else applicable and plan your turn, since you know all the possibilities, and then play accordingly. Study it, because I&#39;ve seen too many people who have been overjoyed at fetching six cards just to lose the game next turn from over-committing and getting everything Thunderquaked away.<br />
<br />
SHADOW BONES<br />
<br />
This one isn&#39;t hard; most of your Creatures have a starting energy of 5+. Don&#39;t pay 4 to give a Wudge +1, but try to pay 4 to give a Borgor +8 whenever possible. You will almost always come out ahead when you use this card.<br />
<br />
WARRIOR&#39;S BOOTS<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll usually only need these when having one more Creature on the board to attack will defeat a Magi; try to save these for such an occasion.<br />
<br />
DREAM RIFT<br />
<br />
There&#39;s only one in the deck, and chances are fairly good you won&#39;t get it before Morag appears, but, if so, you need to be careful how it&#39;s played; three cards for 5 energy leaves you ahead one energy, but you also have the drawback of thickening your deck back with Creatures, which will keep you from your useful Relics and Spells. Another thing, even if you have no Creatures to shuffle back in, you still have to shuffle your deck.<br />
<br />
SHADOW RAIN<br />
<br />
This card is very versatile; all of your Magi are high energizers, and this can provide a much needed boost to the attack, or be used to siphon the energy off of a Creature when you just need more energy. Plus, you get to draw a card (a line of text many people overlook).<br />
<br />
STEALTH<br />
<br />
This can help you out in the off chance you&#39;re hurting for defenders, or want to press your advantage; Stealth lets your Creature strike first, before the opposing Creature can, plus, when the Creature does get to strike back, it removes its new, lesser total, instead of what it had at the begining of the attack (if it&#39;s still around, that is).<br />
<br />
TURN<br />
<br />
Most of what I said under Treachery applies to this card, except you&#39;re only paying three to discard the Creature, but you will discard less then X from the opposing side while gaining an X Creature, but, most importantly, the newly vitalized Creature can attack; it&#39;s like having a Boots and a Creature in one card, as long as they have a weakened Creature. Very useful, but still expensive, so be careful.<br />
<br />
VAPORIZE<br />
<br />
Again, decks are getting more Relic-heavy lately, and we want something Korg can play (because there is an alarming number of games I have played with this deck against similar skill level decks that he has not been defeated) to deal with something annoying early on. Damaging the Magi is just added bonus.<br />
<br />
CORRUPT<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t go wrong with a Corrupt, as long as you play it smartly. Save it until you have board control (more, stronger Creatures, basically), and play it; the opponent will have to waste something to get rid of it, or not play anything at all, keeping the advantage in your favor. And it&#39;s perfect energy advantage; if they give you something as weak as a 2 energy Creature (something most decks don&#39;t have to just toss out), you&#39;ve broken even, because you&#39;ve paid 4 to discard a 2 energy Creature and to gain a 2 energy Creature; anything bigger then that is just a bonus. <br />
<br />
To finish, before everyone starts posting reviews that Korg and Zet are promos, and hard to find, let me ask you this; have you ever really had any problem getting either of them? No. They&#39;re everywhere because there was such a large period of time that they were handed out as tournament prizes, and you don&#39;t have to trade hard for either. A lot of people will even give you a Korg if you want it badly enough, because he&#39;s "so bad". Just imagine how those &#39;advanced&#39; players will feel when a beginner proves them wrong on one of the most overlooked Magi in the game.<br />
