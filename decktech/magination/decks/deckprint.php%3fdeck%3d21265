Barak is a wonderful setup Magi. He gets you the cards you need, when you need them. You always want to go first with Barak, because his starting energy is huge. In most cases, I would just grab the Lava Balamant, but if you know that your opponent runs Corrupts and the like in their deck, go for the Arbolit too. Also, the Arbolit is great defense against the Dark Twins/Corrupt setup. Trying to hold out with Barak is key to getting the cards you need.<br>
When you Prophecy, you will want to go for the Braggles first, so that Barak can stay alive. If your opponent is playing a huge Creature deck, grab the Shockwave. If they&#39;re playing a swarm type deck, grab the Core Grag.<br>
<br>
2nd Magi: Vorga<br>
Vorga is amazing. Basically, what you want to do is Shatter as many things as you can. She is awesome protection versus Rayje&#39;s Belt because 1)If they Lockdown something other than Shatter, you can Shatter the Belt and 2)If they Lockdown Shatter, the other thing isn&#39;t Lockedown, so you can use it.  If there&#39;s a really annoying Pylofuf or Reef Hyren bothering you, Shatter it! The possibilities are endless. I normally save the Scroll of Fire for Gar (if the opponent ever gets to him) but if you can pull off the win (or have a spare one in your hand), go ahead and play it!<br>
<br>
3rd Magi: Gar <br>
Gar is my hero! Well... not really, but he&#39;s really cool. Sure, Naroom has Tryn and her Power, but that doesn&#39;t really matter for Gar. Basically, I play my hoard of Creatures, and Spark the opponent to death! If needed, he will add energy to Braggles (to act as walls) or keep your Ergars in play.  He&#39;s not that hard to play, and should be able to hold his ground.<br>
<br>
**CREATURES** <br>
Arbolit - Dark Twins grabs Corrupt? Give them an Arbolit. Simply a tech. Also starting for Barak and Vorga.<br>
<br>
Lava Balamant - Starting for Barak and Gar.<br>
<br>
Magma Hyren - Pretty darn versatile card. Great for giving Braggles energy so that they can take out a Creature, or simply for their Fireballs.<br>
<br>
Ergar - The Heart of the deck. Ergars + Giant Arbolls makes me happy. Combine with Scroll of Fire to deal super damage.<br>
<br>
Braggle - Great attacking and defending card.<br>
<br>
Core Grag - Weenie wipeout. Yes, you have to pay a regional penalty, but if it&#39;s not going to be worth it, don&#39;t play it.<br>
<br>
Diomant - The great fire squadron. Play these with an Ergar or two, Spark away then Energy Transfer all but one energy to your Magi. Combine with Abraxin&#39;s Crown for an amazing 4 for 1!<br>
<br>
Giant Arboll - Wonderful with Ergars. Play these, Spark your enemies to doom, then return energy to your Magi so that you can play some spell to finish them off!<br>
<br>
Smoke Xyx - Big Colossus giving you problems? Just Suffocate it and attack away! Starting for Vorga.<br>
<br>
**RELICS** <br>
Magma Armor - Basically starting for Gar. If you get one of these in your hand, play it. No exceptions.<br>
<br>
Scroll of Fire - It really is a pity that these only affect Creatures. In any case, they work wonders with Ergars and Core Grags.  Also, as a small side note, Vorga starts with one, so Gar will always have one to work with.<br>
<br>
Relic Stalker - Need I say more?<br>
<br>
Abraxin&#39;s Crown - Wonderful surprise when you play this with a Syphon Vortex.<br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Sword - Tech vs. those evil Burrow decks and Zannah.<br>
<br>
**SPELLS** <br>
Shockwave - That Pylofuf bothering you? Just Shockwave away!<br>
<br>
Fireball - Starting for Gar. Also a very versatile card.<br>
<br>
Syphon Vortex - The Second Heart of the deck. Great for hitting... anything (see Abraxin&#39;s Crown)!<br>
<br>
Thunderquake - Another weenie wipeout.  Also can deal with the big Creatures that are invulnerable to Shockwaves, etc.  Basically another duh.<br>
<br>
Lava Flow - Amazing card. Zannah giving you trouble? Just play this first and she can&#39;t do a single thing about it. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
