I&#39;ve used the same Magi order for Underneath since I started playing, when Underneath was the only region I played. The synergy between the Magi is too good for me to pass up. My problem with Underneath is its lack of card drawing, but by increasing the amount of removal spells, and by optimizing the number of creatures I remove with each one, I can generate some card and energy advantage, in my favor to compensate for the lack of card drawing. I use so much removal to compensate for the lack of strong attack creatures in Underneath, by clearing a path my creatures have no need to get into combat. I use heavy relic removal for problem cards like Rayje&#39;s Sword and Belt. Also, I use a copy of Urhail with serves two purposes; one, it helps vs Entomb, and two, it gives my second and third magi a seven energy starting creature guaranteed.<br>
<br>
This deck shifts gears as the game proceeds, becoming more and more agressive. When you get to Radget, its like hitting the nitro button. <br>
<br>
Gogor goes first. When you can, choose to go second. Gogor&#39;s job is to wear down your opponents resources. By going second, you guarantee the ability to gravel storm on opening turn without worrying about hitting your creatures. Delia is played quite a lot, and newer players tend to drop 2-4 creatures first turn when they can. If you don&#39;t clear the board first turn, you&#39;ll have to use some removal from your hand. Try to be as efficient as you can with every energy you spend. You want Gogor to last a little while to build up some resources in your hand. Try to play as few cards from your hand as possible. Try to play only 1 creature at a time if you can help it, it will minimize the damage Gravel Storm does to your own non-burrowed creatures, and for the most part unless I&#39;m in bad shape, I never play Pylofuf&#39;s on Gogor. I try to stick to playing the Cave Rudwot, the Crystal Arboll, Urhail (which I do not take with Gogor), and Granas. Don&#39;t play the Digging Goggles unless you absolutely have to, they&#39;re set up for Trygar.<br>
<br>
Gogor used to be the first Magi to die, but with the addition of Crushing Fungus, he has been consistantly killing my opponent&#39;s first Magi.<br>
<br>
Trygar is where first shift takes place. His high energize lets him play a lot more removal. This is when you wanna start dropping your Pylofuf&#39;s. Use the Digging Goggles like a Warrior&#39;s Boots. When you have the chance to attack with your Pyofuf&#39;s, play it and smash. I usually play the Ghost Biwsp any time they don&#39;t have a creature on the board, forcing them to either use a spell on it or Boots in a creature to prevent my Pylofuf&#39;s from attacking. Trygar&#39;s high engergize will gain you an edge, and you&#39;ll notice yourself being more and more aggressive. <br>
<br>
ALWAYS save a Parmalag. The Parmalag is the recipient of Trygar&#39;s Avenger effect.<br>
<br>
Trygar generally kills one to two magi, leaving their final, and weakened Magi, for Radget.<br>
<br>
When Trygar goes down, Radget should start the turn with a Parmalag in play via Avenger. Use Refresh on it and Shield it if they have a creature you have to attack. It&#39;s important to manage your energy very closely on Radget. If you think your opponent plays Climbing Staff, do not use the Impact. Try to spread out energy between creatures instead of dumping it all on one. This helps keep direct removal from gaining a large energy advantage on you. <br>
<br>
General play tips and card strategies:<br>
<br>
Crushing Fungus is seriously strong. Force your opponent to overextend his energy resources, and shut them down a turn. It&#39;s best used for setting up a Magi death by locking them at low energy so they cannot deal with your threat. Don&#39;t be afraid to use it on a low energy creature if your opponent is running low on energy. You&#39;ll net your four energy worth from preventing their energize. You can also use it to stall a little bit if you need, letting you energize while your opponent has been crippled a turn. There have been a few times when I&#39;ve had to play one two turns in a row so I could catch back up to my opponent&#39;s energy and gain control of the board. Many times I&#39;ve Crushed an opposing Magi&#39;s last creature, then played a Ghost Bwisp or Crystal Arboll while the opponent only had two energy left on their Magi. All they could do was draw their two cards and wait for death via Arboll or Bwisp, hehehe. :)<br>
<br>
Resonate is all purpose. I never have one in my hand and frown. It helps whittle down an opposing Magi&#39;s energy to help set up for a Crushing Fungus, Remove small creatures not worth a good removal spell, or remove a problem relic, or all of the above ;)  Most definately my favorite card in the deck.<br>
<br>
Parmalag fits the energy curve for the deck. While I usually don&#39;t use him early in the game, he shines while he&#39;s with Radget. Occasionally I&#39;ve been able to use Healing light on one during mid game to wreak some havoc, but that doesn&#39;t happen often.<br>
<br>
Ormagon is to be used wisely. Always count the energy you&#39;d be removing with him before you decide to play him. Some times when it seems like a good time, it isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t forget Ormagon can be used as a beatstick as well. I&#39;ve had to fall back on him as an attacker at times, when I realy didn&#39;t want to. He has a huge target on his head. Also, he works well with Crystal Arboll. You can have a four energy Ormy after you devatate, gaining you energy.<br>
<br>
Thunderquake is the all purpose removal. Don&#39;t be afraid to use it for low amounts of energy if you must. That&#39;s why I play three. <br>
<br>
Shockwave/Bottomless pit-<br>
You&#39;ll notice there are only single copies of each in the deck. Why run them at all your ask? Because there are times when you need direct creature discard instead of energy removal. I like having my options open to me. Shockwave can gain you some energy if you&#39;re opponents put all their eggs in a single basket, or kill opposing burrowed creatures. Honestly, I don&#39;t play it very often unless I have to. Bottomless pit serves the same funcion, but can be effecient on a four energy creature. It works well with a Resonate to bring a five energy creature into Pit range, and helps against opposing Burrowed Creatures.<br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Belt has several tricks in this deck. I&#39;ve found myself at times dropping a belt and using Lockdown on Burrow. Why? So my Pylofuf&#39;s can attack when I need them to;) Don&#39;t be afraid to remove your own belt afterwards if you want to keep your guys burrowed on your opponent&#39;s turn. The belt is a general control card, so it&#39;s been included. It helps vs opposing Burrowed creatures and annoying effects like invulnerability and magi like Sorreah.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel goes in nearly every deck I build. It helps filter out unuseable cards or helps me find ones I need. It also helps vs Storm of Fishes, however, because I have to keep my energy so tight when I play, I don&#39;t play it out as often as I&#39;d like.<br>
<br>
Alternate Build:<br>
I&#39;ve done more playtesting, and I like this alternate build a lot better.<br>
Here are the card changes:<br>
As much as I hate it, I agree with Lic0rice about Fossik being a stronger finisher than Radget now. *cries* Goodbye for now Radget ;(<br>
<br>
<br>
1x Relic Stalker -> 1x Inhibitor Band<br>
1x Rayje&#39;s Belt -> 1x Inhibitor Band<br>
1x Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel-> 1x Crystal Jile (Fossik, Ringsmith starting <br>
<br>
I left in the single Impact because it can be a good finisher, and with the Crystal Jile, you can use his power to add 6 to your magi after you play him, and then Impact, only losing 1 energy if they Climbing Staff it, or gaining 3 damage to their dome if it goes through. It also can help set up a Crushing Fungus by depleting your opponent&#39;s energy if its a little high. By Impacting for 4 first, your opponent will probably be a little more reluctant to Staff it, then Crush a creature to lock them at a more hindered energy count.<br>
<br>
<br>
This versions uses Inhibitor bands to prevent the Belts and Sword from hitting the board. I generally use my Warrior&#39;s Boots for the opening turn of a Magi, then drop the Band. I use the Belt only when I truly need it, instead of the Inhibitor band.<br>
<br>
<br>
The deck is a little tedious to play at times, but it&#39;s solid. I never lose to anything short of combo consistantly. It can compete, but doesn&#39;t have as high a win ratio nor the draw power that I prefer. <br>
<br>
I&#39;ll update this deck as I gain more info on playtesting with suggestions. Thanks Lic0rice for bringing Fossik to my attention.<br>
