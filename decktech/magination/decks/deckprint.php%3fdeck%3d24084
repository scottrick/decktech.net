i no i have a lot of 1s and 2s,its because i just started using weave and dont have a lot of good cards. but i will post a better version of this deck wen i do get the better cards.<br>
<br><br>
 quirle: he has a nice effect, gift of life, which adds one to a weave creature at the beggining of each turn, which is very nice. he only starts with one creature, but it is a helpful creature. vuryip, wen it attacks or is attacked draw one card. i only put one cause i would only use it for quirle cause i personally dont think its good. the fun starts wen u get out weave hyren. comine its power with quirle&#39;s power and you get to add one energy to all of ur creatures =) <br>
<br><br>
kesia: i think she is the best magi because all weave spells she uses cost two less, but she cant use non-weave spells, but i dont have any in here. plus, wen you use an effect that moves energy, you add one energy to the creature that ed the effect which is good.if i had grass hyren and kesias flute i would put them in here but i dont have jack when it comes to weave. <br>
<br><br>
bo&#39;ahsa: she is fun with uwamar and those creatures that gain a lot of energy but cant attack. her effect is basically like gum-gum, wen one of your creatures is attacked, you may switch it with another one of your creatures. and wen those little guys get built up the can pack and serious punch.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
scout bungaloo is a good creature  beacuse if it is attacked u can discard it adding its energy plus 2 to anohter creature, which basically wastes an opponents attack. jungertrug of course is all offense. zayas bow is helpful if u have sawgrass and/or pody. use binding when u have a creature that is strong but cant attack, like yajo unless u wanna keep usi his power. if u uSE another binding, use it on the same creature of yours so u only have one bound creature. stealth is good cause u basically get to attack before damage is done, and then you attack. use sheath on a guy that you used binding on so it stays alive longer to keep your opponent inactive. pretty much everything else is slef explainatory i hope u enjoy this deck!   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
