<BR><br>
      Delia: i try 2 go second if possible, that way i start off with enough energy, start off by pulling 3 vellups, an elder vellup, and a warlum. then use the warlums power to look through your opponents deck, if s/he has something useful, then great, if not, then at least i know exactly what their deck is like, and i can (within reason) expect what they are going to play, keep using vellups and elder vellups, pulling creatures like lovians, brannix&#39;s, and aerial flists, but dont use them unless you have to, save them for sorreah. also, dont play any Xyx&#39;s, unless u get a couple Bubble Xyx&#39;s, then use one, if you have plenty of energy.<br>
<BR><br>
       Sorreah: usually pick up a cataclysm unless i already have drawn it, and either a shockwave or crushing winds, and of course sorreahs dream.  use those lovians, brannixs, aerial flists, and flutter yups to wear down your opponent. cataclysm first thing if the opponent has a decent amount of creatures out, then start playing those creatures, aerial flist and brannix, teamed with a storm ring, can mow through almost any creatures, and use shockwave, crushing winds, and storm cloud for creature they cant handle. still hold off on those xyx&#39;s.<br>
<BR> <br>
     Defender of the Sky: pull the xyx&#39;s, play an elder xyx, a minor xyx, a bubble xyx, and a xyx, which all adds up to 14 energy, leaving the defender with one, or, if i feel lucky, ill play 2 xyx minors, an elder xyx, and a bubble xyx, then i can use bubble xyx&#39;s power and draw 2 cards, but no energy is left on my magi,use xyx minor&#39;s power on itself so that its getting 2 energy every turn, and use elder xyx&#39;s power as soon as u play it on the first turn the defender comes out, and it will still have 2 energy left, so at the end of my first turn, i have a 6 energy xyx minor, a 2 energy xyx elder, a five energy bubble xyx, and a five energy xyx, and a die roll of energy removed from all of my opponents creatures, not a bad start, then start playing the other xyx&#39;s in my hand, and use bubble xyx&#39;s power, along with the discard spells,is a hard combination to beat<br>
<BR><br>
<BR><br>
   Creatures:<br>
 The vellups are for Delia, the xyx&#39;s are for Defender of the Sky, the other cards are either hard hitters,(aerial flist, brannix), or cards that have useful powers or effects, (flutter yup, lovian, and warlum)<br>
<BR><br>
   Relics:<br>
 arderian guard wings are for cald(2 many examples) and bograth (Yogs maul, ainjer)decks,as well as the occasional tap roots, lightning, or any of the crushing cards.  the storm rings are for offense, the mantle of shadows is in case the opponent entombs my discard spells, and the relic stalkers are for the opponents relics that are giving me a headache.<br>
<BR><br>
   Spells:<br>
 Sorreahs dream is if i want to use one of my opponent creatures spells against them (using Giant Carrillions Stomp on itself, he he) but usually i use it to copy xyx elders shockstorm power.  lightning, crushing winds, shockwave, storm cloud, and cataclysm are all for discarding the opponents creatures that my creature cant handle.  <br>
<BR><br>
<BR><br>
   Combos:<br>
Flutter yup and storm ring: flutter yup keeps getting bigger, if they discard it with a undertow or something like that, i only paid one energy for it.<br>
Storm ring and aerial flist/brannix: 2 energy every time they attack<br>
<BR><br>
<BR><br>
well, thats about it, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br>
