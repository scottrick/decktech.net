Total: 40 + 3 Magi   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I use Baa first, for his awesome power of drawing cards. I usually don&#39;t try to take down any Magi with him; he&#39;s just there to stall and draw cards.<br>
<br>
Next up, I use Phlouk....Now, I haven&#39;t seen anyone use him yet, and I don&#39;t know why. Here&#39;s why he&#39;s such a powerhouse: All the important powers on my creatures can only be used before my attack phase....which means that unless I get them into play with Crushing Darkness, they probably aren&#39;t gonna be around for me to use them on my next turn.<br>
<br>
Blygt is here, obviously, because he is nigh-broken. If I even get to him, I&#39;ve already drawn through my deck once, and am about halfway through my deck again. If, for some reason, Phlouk gets taken down too quickly, and I just re-shuffled my discard/deck, I&#39;m still not too crippled on the merits of his starting cards alone.<br>
<br>
Things to watch out for:<br>
<br>
Burrowing: This is really annoying, but recycling an Ainjer will take care of borrowed junk in short order.<br>
<br>
Cataclysm/Ormagon: This really shouldn&#39;t be as much of a problem as it is, but I&#39;m never paying attention and always over commit. When I am paying attention, however, a Cataclysm or Ormagon doesn&#39;t do any real damage. At the very worst, I&#39;ll lose a Bog Stone/Moss Pendant and not have a replacement handy. Of course, then I chortle at my opponent for blowing 10e.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve never had enogh of a problem with other deck archtypes, such as Akido, Paradwyn Power, or TurboGia, to merit any special strategies or deck tweaking.<br>
