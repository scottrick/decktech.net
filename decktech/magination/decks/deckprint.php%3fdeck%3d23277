This deck uses Evu to set up Tryn & Pruitt, Tryn to get put some pressure on the opponent, and Pruitt to finish him off with a combo that works together pretty darn well.<br>
<br>
With Evu, your main focus is to stay alive long enough to draw a bunch of cards. These are a few of the cards you are aiming for with Evu:<br>
Crystal Parmalag, Yaki&#39;s Gauntlets, Vim and Vigor, and Dream Channel. Those cards will be pretty important later on, and if you pull them early on in the game you won&#39;t have to worry about it later on with Tryn and Pruitt.<br>
Evu and Tryn should be able to take out at least one opposing magi, if they take out two, even the better.  Once you get to Pruitt, youre gonna want to play at least 2 Crystal Parmalag, in case one gets defeated in attacks during the opponent&#39;s turn. When your turn starts, if your Crystal Parmalag is below starting energy, use Dream Balm on him to restore him to starting energy and then use refresh on him. In the next few turns, this Crystal Parmalag will become a huge roadblock, and it can serve you either on the defense of offense with the huge amounts of energy it will be gaining. With Pruitt&#39;s Robe, Tree Hinko&#39;s, Dream Channel, and Refresh, your Parmalag will be gaining anywyere from 5 to 12 energy every turn. 5 at the very least from the Robe, and 12 you can achieve if you use Tree Hinko, Dream Channel, and Refresh as well. With the Robe, you&#39;ll add your energize of 5 to the Parmalag. And since your magi is Pruitt, she will also gain 2. Use those 2 energy to Refresh the Parmalag to give him an additional 3. You probably will not have to worry about being at zero energy with Pruitt, since the Parmalag survives Cataclysm, Shockwave, Tidal Wave, and most of the opposing attacks. When your Parmalag has 25-30 energy, use Vim and Vigor on him to give everything above 7 to Pruitt. OR: You can use Impact just for the heck of it to take off ungodly amounts of energy off the oposing magi.<br>
Ok, heres a short recap of what you want to do once you get to Pruitt.<br>
Play 2 or more Crystal Parmalag>>>Drop Pruitt&#39;s Robe and use it to add a ton of energy to the Parm. every turn>>> Drop Yaki&#39;s Gauntlets and use them to attack the opponent relentlessly with the Huge Parm.>>>Use Vim and Vigor and/or impact to gain the most advantage from the energy on the Parm.>>> Use Tree Hinko, Refresh, Tap Roots, Grow, and Dream Channels to gain even more energy. <br>
But make sure to slap the Dream Channel just on the parmalag, nothing else. If you play it on a Furok or Wasperine, it&#39;s too easily removed and you won&#39;t be gaining a lot of energy from it. <br>
<br>
That is the deck. I thought of it last night on Cardnight, and when I came home I fixed it together and this is what I eneded up with. Any suggestions are welcome, and thanks for reading the strategy section. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
