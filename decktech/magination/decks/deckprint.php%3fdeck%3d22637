TOTAL: 45 (non-Magi) Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     This is my first attempt at a Bograth deck.  For simplicity.  I have created it all out of Nightmare&#39;s Dawn cards.  If you are just starting Magi-Nation, or haven&#39;t yet bought any cards but would like to learn to play, this deck shouldn&#39;t be that hard to learn.<br>
<br>
     The basic theme behind this deck is getting a lot of creatures into play.  The first magi (Baa) lets you start with three small creatures (Green Stuff rocks).  You should spend your first turn playing as many small creatures as you can.  Remember to use Baa&#39;s effect to draw more creatures.  The rest of the game you should try to play creatures and draw cards.  <br>
<br>
     There are several ways to pump up your creatures. First of all, there are creatures that will help with this.  Bolobog & Ooze Arboll each have powers to give out energy equal to the number of creatures you have in play.  The relic, Moss Pendant and the spell, Frenzy are both great ways to increase your energy.  (Be careful though, because Frenzy adds energy to your opponent&#39;s creatures too.)<br>
<br>
     Another important theme in this deck is card drawing. The master of card drawing in this deck is Baa.  Baa&#39;s effect Hordes lets you discard an energy from him to draw an extra card at the end of that turn every time you play a creature.  At the end of the first turn, you could possibly draw seven cards and have five creatures in play.  There are a few creatures that let you draw as well.  Gremble & Slarnath have card drawing abilities, and Gwaeg&#39;s Escape effect should let you play him several times each game.  The relic Great Pool of Wisdom should let you draw a card more often than not.<br>
<br>
     The remaining class of cards in the deck is removal.  Muck Vinoc, Quido Swarm, Sarazen Outcast, and Zungg should all help eliminate opposing creatures.  The spells: Darkness & Crushing Stench, and the Yog&#39;s Maul relic should also be useful against enemy critters.  There is also a Vard Stampede to deal with relics and spells.<br>
<br>
     If you have access to cards from other sets, there are a few changes I would make:  Relic Stalkers or Beam of Lights would be useful.  As would Rayje&#39;s Belt and/or Thunderquakes.  Please feel free to experiment.  I am not finished changing this deck.  This is just a beginner&#39;s version of what I hope to eventually be an awesome Bograth swarm deck.  Have Fun! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
