Total: 40 Cards   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">With Core messing over Naroom so terribly in the storyline, I just had to make this deck. Designed specifically to destroy a Core deck, its speed and overall design is meant to deal with just about any region that gets between Core and these magi. Fortunately, it looks like Core is leaving Vash Naroom. I have to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s about time.&#8221; With Tillant as Naroom&#8217;s ally, it is a wonder that Core has held out so long. It must be all those Naroom magi they turned. Curse them! And, oh yeah, I think I took this deck against Core maybe once or twice. Most of the time it was against the other regions.... Stop getting in the way! <br />
<br />
Tiller is meant to draw cards. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your opponent was the Dark Twins and went first, use Vortex of Knowledge. If you don&#8217;t get what you need, a Weeblit and Weebo combo can render a first turn Corrupt fairly useless on its own. Otherwise, sacrifice the Weeblit to draw two more cards. While most people might sacrifice the Weebo as well, only do this if absolutely necessary. The Weebo has so many uses in a Naroom deck, that it is probably better to hold on to it. You should have plenty of cards to work with. However, do note that Yaki also starts with a Weebo, so you&#8217;ll be getting this little guy back. Play things rough with Tiller. Since he shouldn&#8217;t be spending much energy on card draw, you can devote his energize to working with the spells and creatures to take out at least one, maybe two magi. I&#8217;ve even had him take all three. <br />
<br />
However, keep in mind that you want to draw cards frequently with Tiller using either of his powers, though sacrificing relics is preferred. For example, both Yaki and Pruitt start with their relics, so those make great bait for his power. Similar story on most of the relics, including the Relic Stalkers. While most of the relics in the deck can be useful in the right settings, you can severely hinder a Tiller deck like this if you try and hold them in the hand. Quickly, you should have enough spare relics in the hand that you&#8217;ll start playing some of them out for their advantages. Still, keep at least one in the hand with Tiller to make sure you can use his power next turn. <br />
<br />
As a quick example, I let one of our better Naroom player borrow this deck for a game. After losing somewhat miserably, she told me that it just wasn&#8217;t &#8220;grow-y&#8221; enough for them, as if it was a toned down Naroom deck. I took this as a challenge to the growth potential of my Naroom deck. Well, she fetched her own Naroom deck from her car and we pitted them against each other to see which one could &#8220;grow&#8221; faster. Tiller beat all three of her magi, including Tryn. The difference was in the use of Tiller&#8217;s power. When she had used my deck, she held the relics in the hand. However, as I demonstrated what the deck could do, I only played half the relics and sacrificed the other half for more cards. <br />
<br />
So why did Tiller get three paragraphs in this strategy? Well, because most of my opponents never got past him. <br />
<br />
If you can manage to have several extra relics in the hand, then hold one copy of Warrior&#8217;s Boots for Yaki. With his double strike, plus his gauntlets, Yaki can deliver a fast and crippling blow. This combos nicely with the Furok. Two Warriors Boots plus one Bythan&#8217;s Gift can actually make a very powerful opening move with Yaki. In this case, use both Warriors Boots (one at a time, of course), to place both the Furok and the Weebo that Yaki starts with. Mix in Bythan&#8217;s Gift to make that one monstrous Furok. Between his own effect and his gauntlets, he can really wreck someone&#8217;s day by doing that. The Warrior&#8217;s Boots in the deck are really intended for Yaki. <br />
<br />
Pruitt goes on the end for two reasons. First, she also pulls a relic. And while there might be a trick to use her relic with other magi (mostly the Furok), it really excels under her control. Secondly, she has a modest power and starts with the Vinoc. I&#8217;ll cover more on the Vinoc later. Still, Pruitt starts with a decent relic and a two creatures. With her relic, Pruitt can be considered to gain seven energy per turn. Place her energize on one of her creatures and add two to Pruitt. This two energy is enough to use her power, and the combo can really devastate a Kybar&#8217;s Teeth deck if you have a Giant Carillion that stays in play several turns. <br />
<br />
Part of the threat in a Core deck is the use of Entomb to shut down opposing spells (and maybe purity). Vinoc allows this deck to recover a little something from such an annoyance. With plenty of card draw as well, the Vinoc usually will end up with plenty of cards to sacrifice to its power. Of course, don&#8217;t dump your entire hand into this one creature. Hopefully, you won&#8217;t need to use its power. <br />
<br />
With it being an anti-Core deck, of course there are three Tillants in here. If you want to switch to anti-burrow, then put in three Garan instead. Basically, anything you chose to metagame for, place the desirable Naroom creature(s) in this slot. <br />
<br />
Alpine Xamf, Robe of Vines, and Orwin&#8217;s Ring combo to provide the deck with over-the-top growth. This is the combo that gets Tiller past many opposing magi. You don&#8217;t need to pull it off all at once. Remember, Tiller should keep one or two relics in the hand to sacrifice to his power. Just field this combo as it reveals itself. Once it is all in play, the combo adds three to each creature played that turn, using only one Alpine Xamf. In addition, each creature that continues to remain in play will gain one energy at the end of subsequent turns. This provides a great and easy way to heal your creatures from the damage they&#8217;ll take in combat. <br />
<br />
Giant Carillion provides the deck&#8217;s direct discard, it also combos with Weebo, Bythan&#8217;s Gift, and Pruitt&#8217;s Robe. <br />
<br />
Tree Hinko provides a little more energy, and it also combos with Bythan&#8217;s Gift. A great combo, whether using the gift to make this thing large for repeated use turn after turn, or sending it back to the hand for another use later. <br />
<br />
As you may have noticed, if there is any one spell that this deck depends on greatly, it is Bythan&#8217;s Gift. Against Core, you might find this Entombed quickly. Do not fear. This is where your Tillant should shine, and Bythan&#8217;s Gift along with Orwin&#8217;s Ring will then be food for the Vinocs. Mostly, Bythan&#8217;s Gift is for when you are facing anything that&#8217;s not Core, although a Core deck that fails to Entomb this may also find it to be a powerful spell. <br />
<br />
If I were to adjust this deck for Sorreah, then I would choose to replace Warrior&#8217;s Boots with Climbing Staff. Not my first choice of things to do. Personally, I would rather not. If Sorreah is their last magi, then I wouldn&#8217;t even worry much since the creatures, relics, and spells needed should already be in hand. However, Sorreah as a first magi, I would hope to go first, draw a bunch before he flips over, and then take him out as fast as possible. Either way, I would try and take out Sorreah with Warrior&#8217;s Boots and Wasperines. Fortunately, it is not uncommon for someone using Sorreah as a starter to want to go second to get just the right spells (ex:Cataclysm), so don&#8217;t play too much out. Warrior&#8217;s Boots and Wasperines are in this deck for that wonderful element of surprise. Still, going first is to this deck&#8217;s advantage. That one turn of card draw can make a great difference. <br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s a list of possible substitutions for some the rare/limited cards in the deck. <br />
<br />
Tiller* &#8212; Tryn <br />
Alpine Xamf &#8212; Weebo/Furok <br />
Bhatar &#8212; Rudwot<br />
Wasperine &#8212; Forest Jile <br />
Bythan&#8217;s Gift &#8212; a third Tap Roots, a third Crushing Roots, and one Grow <br />
Orwin&#8217;s Ring &#8212; Weeblit (add more Weebo)/Pruitt&#8217;s Robe(add more Furok) <br />
<br />
*Not recommended, but reality can be a large factor. This swaps card draw for energy tactics. In this case, I would drop the Vortex of Knowledge as well for one Rudwot.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
