Those of you from the old school may recognize the name from one of Capcom&#39;s original NES shooters!  I used to love the game, so I thought I&#39;d pay homage.  But this is no themed deck by any means.  This is true Arderian abuse of power at it&#39;s finest and is tailored for success through my style of play.  It&#39;s not easy to master all of the combinations within the deck, but if your execution is on point, you should have a pretty decisive victory.  If you&#39;re in denial that an Arderial deck can be successful w/o Ora, then I challenge you to read ahead and see for yourself.  If you follow my example, pretty soon you won&#39;t even miss her!  Besides, she doesn&#39;t have wings! =P<br>
<br>
PLAYERS GUIDE:<br>
DELIA:<br>
Well, I&#39;m quite sure that anyone reading this is familiar w/ the effectiveness of the &quot;Vellup Lady.&quot;  Delia can provide you w/ recurring Vellups that can fetch other Vellups, that can fetch Elder Vellups, that can fetch Arderial Creatures, etc....this we know.  The ability to thin your deck out this early in the game can prove invaluable.  However, when playing w/ Delia on an advanced level, you want to be aware of your weaknesses.  Sure, it may seem reasonable to play all 3 of your Vellups and even an Elder Vellup on the first turn and overwhelm your opponent w/ creatures.  However, you become susceptible to mass removal techniques such Ormagon, Thunderquake, Cataclysm and my personal favorite Delia killer...O&#39;Qua-Conjure-Deep Hyren-Submerge-Hurricane!  Therefore, we wanna resist the temptation to flood the board w/ Vellups and test the waters a bit just to be safe.  You can only reclaim 1 Vellup each turn, so if they&#39;re all in the discard, you&#39;re screwed...so remember this before you over-commit!<br>
<br>
1st turn:  Take 1 Vellup for starting and draw your hand to 5.  I usually play just 2 Vellups, 1 Elder Vellup and snatch the single Night Hyren to hold for later.  Night Hyren is an essential part of the deck that will be discussed momentarilly.  Obviously, if you&#39;re playing against another Arderial deck, Brannix is a more appropriate choice.  W/ 12 energy on the board and 3 energy on Delia, you are out of the 10 point Thunderquake range.  If you really anticipate some serious mass removal, I&#39;d suggest playing only 1 Vellup and 1 Elder Vellup to be on the safe side.  Know your opponent.  W/ each subsequent play of your Elder Vellups, begin to pull the Xyx Minors from your deck and hold them for Sorreah.  Continue to keep the pressure on w/ Delia and put up as much of a fight as you can.  If you can manage to take down their first magi w/ Delia, then you will have pretty smooth sailing from here on out.  Just remember to suicide before they amount too much energy.  Also, take caution when playing Arderial spells w/ Delia.  Try not to use more than 1 Sorreah&#39;s Dream or Shockwave.  You&#39;ll know within the first couple of turns whether or not you&#39;ll need a Cataclysm to level the playing field or not, so try not to handicap Sorreah by loading the discard w/ other spells.  If there are 2 Arderial spells left in the discard after taking the Sorreah&#39;s Dream, you gotta take &#39;em, so think smart.  <br>
<br>
Cards to save for Sorreah: Night Hyren, Warrior&#39;s Boots, Alaban Gloves, Xyx Minor, Xyx<br>
<br>
SORREAH:<br>
The &quot;Vanilla Sundae&quot; himself!  Sorreah is an invaluable magi in this slot...capable of throwing a wrench in the best laid plans.  <br>
When you reveal Sorreah, you will first check your discard pile for a copy of Sorreah&#39;s Dream as well as 2 other Arderial spells of your choice.  At this point in the discard, there should be only 1 Sorreah&#39;s Dream, no more than 2 Shockwaves, and maybe 1 Cataclysm if you went 2nd and were fortunate enough to draw 1.  Remember to take the Dream first and then the 2 spells.  If you&#39;ve controlled the game up until this point, it should be relatively easy to defeat their magi.  There are several combinations capable of doing this, but if you don&#39;t choose the appropriate one for the situation, you can make your life much more difficult.<br>
<br>
1st:  W/ several creatures in play and minimal energy on their magi, playing Cataclysm followed by a Xyx and Sorreah&#39;s Dream has become a classic Sorreah &quot;coup de grace!&quot;<br>
<br>
2nd:  If they&#39;ve managed to keep Delia at bay while energizing or even kept their creatures to a minimum to conserve energy in anticipation of your tactics, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re well prepared!  Night Hyren is a 9 energy Hyren capable of flying over your opponent&#39;s creatures to attack the magi, gaining 2 energy in the process, and possibly 2 additional energy if you have a Storm Ring in play!  Having saved the Night Hyren and a Warrior&#39;s Boots, you should be able to reduce their magi to nothing.  However, casting the Night Hyren is a costly move and leaves your magi w/ only half of his energy.  This is where the Alaban Gloves come into play.  Undreaming the Hyren gives you all that energy right back...essentially removing all of their energy at no cost to you whatsoever!  Under the ideal situation, you may even have more energy than you started w/!  W/ a Storm Ring, the Hyren will attack for 13...and after Undreaming will bring Sorreah to 19!  Follow that w/ a Cataclysm in your 2nd P/S/R step, and they&#39;re toast!  Good night Twins! =P  However, if you can get away w/ Shockwaving or Thunderquaking whatever creature(s) they have left, play a Xyx Minor or two.  As long as you have enough energy to Undream, you&#39;re fine.  After removing their creatures, pump the Minors up w/ your Sorreah&#39;s Dream, and you&#39;re more than ready to handle whatever they have in store for you next!<br>
<br>
3rd:  Shockwave/Thunderquake/Alaban Gloves + Warrior&#39;s Boots + Ayebaw.  Classic Arderial tactic that never gets old!  If the Boots aren&#39;t readily available and you have a Cloud Sceptre in hand, feel free to dump any spare Vellups in hand to get at them.<br>
<br>
Sorreah&#39;s Dream is the key to pulling off many of these combinations, so experiment, and take your time when thinking of what to do.<br>
<br>
If for some reason Sorreah is forced to do battle, then so be it.  In most energy battles, you should have the advantage.  You&#39;ve got the removal as well as creatures that essentially energize every turn.  w/ Sorreah&#39;s Dream, Xyx Minors can become extremely huge in no time flat!  If you find yourself, outmatched against the Twins or Quilla, it may be in your best interest to hurt them as much as possible while suiciding and taking your chances w/ Aula.  Use the Relic Stalkers to take care of any Rayje&#39;s Belts your opponent may use to Lockdown your Suppress effect, and you should be just fine.<br>
<br>
AULA:<br>
Aula is a superb finishing magi in my opinion!  I&#39;m a speed player and very impatient at times.  When I reach my final magi, I usually know exactly what it is I need to finish my opponent...however, card games always have a way of denying you that &quot;1&quot; card you need to put your opponent&#39;s lights out!  When the game&#39;s over you curse your luck as that card happens to be at the bottom of the deck!  Aula puts your luck in your hands...rewarding any player who takes the time to memorize their deck.  Between her &quot;Windsight&quot; power, Cloud Sceptre, and Sorreah&#39;s Dream, there should be nothing in your deck that is out of your reach.  If things have gone your way, you should be able put them away utilizing the same tactics outlined above, w/ the addition of one more...<br>
<br>
4th:  The single Dark Ayebaw in the deck is there just for this occasion and this occasion only.  So be sure to save it if drawn early on.  Feel free to search for it as long as you have enough ammunition to put them away.  Search for your final Cataclsym if you haven&#39;t drawn it already and play it followed by the Dark Ayebaw...use its &quot;Implode&quot; power on their magi...then discard your hand to deal &quot;2+the number of Arderial cards discarded&quot; in damage to their magi.  In most cases, this should be more than enough to finish them.  <br>
<br>
Starting w/ the Cloud Sceptre allows you to Cataclysm w/o worry, cuz you still have access to the Warrior&#39;s Boots, Ayebaw&#39;s, Xyx&#39;s and other assorted goodies still in the deck.  Use her card sorting abilities to put an end to your opponent or to maintain control of the board w/ your spells and creatures to mount a comeback if things haven&#39;t gone your way.<br>
<br>
FINAL NOTES:<br>
The Mantle of Shadows is a metagame decision that can be very pivotal in the success of the deck in the battle against Core.  Entomb is the bane of the deck, and this relic allows you to counter in good fashion.  Try to resist the temptation to play it early on only to get a Shockwave in and risk losing it...when it would better serve you later for a much needed Cataclysm.  Aula can also search for it late in the game if needed.  W/ the Cloud Sceptre it shouldn&#39;t be dead weight in your hand for very long against non-core regions either.<br>
<br>
Although Ora is a very strong magi in her own respect, this is not a creature war deck, and her talents are not as valuable in this deck as the card cycling abilities of Aula.  Unless you happen to save a Cloud Sceptre for Ora, you have to make do w/ what you have, and that&#39;s not what we want.  Besides...she doesn&#39;t have wings!=P j/k  However, if you feel safer playing w/ Ora then by all means do so.  I&#39;d suggest adding another Cloud Sceptre to increase your options, but the Shooting Star may handicap Sorreah if it winds up in the discard w/ Delia.  It&#39;s also rather refreshing to not blame your losses on a bad Xyx Elder roll for once...but that&#39;s just my humble opinion!:)<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Your options are only limited by your knowledge of the deck and it&#39;s capabilities.  So learn the deck well and master it&#39;s combinations to own the competition!  Have fun!<br>
