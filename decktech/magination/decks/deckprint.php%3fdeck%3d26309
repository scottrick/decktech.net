I used the title because there are 2 key magi and they do everything! Ok, Adjudicator and I have been playing around with this deck for a little while and have torn it apart and put it together over and over.  We need some good advice. In other words. . . We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was before. Better. Stronger. Faster. Squintier than before. We shall make him a slightly overweight, bronzed Adonis, with a funny, lopsided mouth. A better mouth. Better. Better. Yes, better. BETTER!<br />
<br><br />
With Bria I make her Core get the Warrada&#39;s Ring and Secrets of the Book.  Shes there for just cards drawing.  I only use her to cleanse koil, which is vital in this deck. I also just play the card drawing creatures until she is defeated.<br />
<br><br />
Here is where the fun begins, with O&#39;qua, play all relics, get rid of any creatures that are a threat, conjure a Giant Parathin(GP) and if you have a mirror pendent or a sorreah&#39;s dream, conjure something else to that can draw cards. Interchange and bring up Shaper&#39;s Apprentice, do anything else you want and sacrifice a creature that used its power to draw cards to dream twist and bring back the GP, to take O&#39;qua out, conjure another GP, sorreah&#39;s dream conjure again (if you have it) or use mirror pendent (if you haven&#39;t already done it) interchange the GP to take out Shaper&#39;s Apprentice and find a way to use up eight energy, dream twist the GP, to get to O&#39;qua play a Will of Orothe and conjure the final parathin. Interchange and get to Shaper&#39;s Apprentice. Now you&#39;re probably thinking that the fun just went down the drain. Wrong! Remember the Koil? Play a Warrior&#39;s Boots and the koil, then ram into one of your opponent&#39;s creatures to get your discard pile back! Muahahahahaha! Get the GP back from the discard pile and interchange again! Now wash, rinse, repeat this strategy and draw as many cards as possible. You will soon fine that nothing the opponent has can stop you from utterly crushing them! If they try to lay down an army? Typhoon the creatures away! Or, use deep hyrens to clear the board of little swarms. The fun must end somwhere, but, because you played the Will of Orothe, you are completely safe from any lingering creautres that your typhoon didn&#39;t wipe out. <br />
<br><br />
I use the koil and not the dream rift idea because I need to get soreahs dream back in the deck along with typhoon and The Will.<br />
<br><br />
The gloves are for when you draw a creature, for example draw a Giant Parathin. I use the gloves put it in the discard pile then use sharpers appr to interchange.<br />
<br><br />
The K&#39;teeb is to copy any creature that has a power to draw cards or the Giant Parathen.<br />
<br><br />
Any good help is needed.  Any helpful advice is apricaited.<br />
<br><br />
Credit goes to Adjudicator and everyone else who helped out on the last *POP!* deck.<br />
