<br>
First off i would like to say that i don&#39;t want any bad reviews becuase my card count is 41, i couldn&#39;t help it and just because it&#39;s one over doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad deck.<br>
<br>
Now that i&#39;ve said that, let me tell you how this deck came to be. i was searching around on decktech one day and saw a deck called broken blu so i took a look. since i&#39;m fairly new at decktech i didn&#39;t have a chance to see it then. The concept was ingenius but the only problem was the recent rulings on blu and weggit. i thought about what i could do and this is what came to mind.<br>
<br>
Aula comes first and just like broken blu she should be lasting a turn, maybe 2. Use her with the same strategy as in broken blu, play what you can, then windsight, and mindwind the rest.(the J&#39;Lith is there for windsight so use it, also discard all weave relics and anything not helpful at the moment). becuase you can&#39;t use weggit, you might have to wait another turn but try not to stay too long.<br>
<br>
When Borse comes up you should have a pylofuf and some other cards to stall. Try to use tinker as much as possible to get those weave relics in play and Cloud Sceptor. With the sceptor you can discard all weave relics so when you&#39;ve cycled you can tinker it out. Ounce you have a decent amount of weave relics you can pull off the full combo but you can start almost immeadiately after Borse comes out. There are 11 weave relics in this deck so it&#39;s possible to more than half your deck in 1 turn. These are the cards you&#39;ll want, 2 osatch&#39;s to protect you, and pylofuf with a dream channel. what you&#39;ll do is flood about 2 times a turn, WoO/Entangle, 1 or 2 weggits a turn getting as much as 20 cards a turn, and a river abaquist which will be stealing every turn,(don&#39;t forget to hubdra spear their magi after floods). with Karak Band and Necklace you&#39;ll also be getting 2E back and 2 cards. After a few turns you won&#39;t be using Tinker but if they can get past your osatch&#39;s and vaporize it&#39;ll help you set back up.<br>
<br>
If they get past Borse and I stress &quot;IIFFFFFFF&quot;, Bria is there to back him up. you&#39;ll want to get weave relics and it doesn&#39;t matter, as long as you can get that cycle again like Borse.<br>
<br>
Combo that is used in broken blu is boots,ormagon,baloo root, hubdra spear and attack.<br>
Some things you&#39;ll have to watch out for is chur and sorreah. this is very tricky and you&#39;ll have to stay on Aula untill you get a rayje&#39;s belt.<br>
<br>
Cards<br>
<br>
Gift of Weave: yes i know if your magi isn&#39;t weave or weave shadow it is discarded. you have to lockdown the effect with rayje&#39;s belt before you play it it can work<br>
<br>
Vault of Knowledge Key: When i saw this card the first thing that came to mind was warrior&#39;s boots. Only have 1 boots but 2 creatures, the key can take care of that. it&#39;s effects let you discard another relic instead if a relic discards itself. The next effect is that you can use powers on your relics an additional time but you must discard the relics that you used twice that turn. the trick is that warrior&#39;s boots discards the 2nd time anyways.<br>
<br>
Staff of Keepers: always name weave for the osatch and weggits<br>
<br>
Weggits - Osatch: the 2 Osatch&#39;s are very crucial to the cycle because they protect each other, pylofuf and your relics. try bend with kesia&#39;s flute or Tuk Berries to get more energy on osatch from weggits and baloo roots.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel: when trying to start the cycle this is a crucial card and remember, if i get&#39;s discarded, you can play it again.<br>
<br>
Weave relics: all weave relics are in this deck for 1 reason only, for drawing, there is no need to use any except maybe gia&#39;s tome, kesia&#39;s flute, and Tuk Berries<br>
<br>
Well that&#39;s how i reformed broken blu and i hope you give this a good rating. since this is based on it i didn&#39;t use that many nightmare&#39;s dawn but i don&#39;t think it is neccessary. note that there are 2 cards that i sometimes use for metagame purposes, rayje&#39;s sword for underneath, and mantle of shadows for entomb. Another thing is that this is not meant for beginners, this takes a lot of practice and experience to full play this deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
