Total: 40 Cards + 2 Magi (3 effectively)   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The main concept with this deck is to get a quick advantage, then keep the beatdown going.  Lead with The Dark Twins, and ALWAYS go first. Grab Entomb, Corrupt and Borgor as your starting cards, then get your extra four (as per DT&#39;s text). <br>
<br>
I suggest Entombing either Shockwave, Cataclysm or Beam of Light right off, because they tend to trash your creatures and relics. Meta-game your play enviroment.<br>
<br>
Try to save a Deadfall or Corrupt to play right before their next Magi comes in. It stops their ability to build a creature wall and makes their next Magi very vulnerable for a turn or two.<br>
<br>
Save the Shadow Bones for a Borgor or Gorath, both are reusable, and take out creatures fast. A good trick is to play a Gorath with Warrior&#39;s Boots, Shadow Bones him, and steal up to a 19 energy creature away from your opponent. If you time it right, you can take out a Magi very easily with this. Creature theft makes up for not having Shockwave or Tidal Wave avalible to Core. <br>
<br>
Use Borgor or Core Grag, then Blight. Very effective at taking out creature swarms. <br>
<br>
Since DE, a lot of people here have moved to using Beam Of Light to destroy relics, instead of Relic Stalkers, and if you Entomb the Beam of Light, they have very few ways to remove the Chaos Spheres from play.  If your enviroment is different, change the Chaos Spheres to another Secrets of the Book and Shadow Bones.<br>
<br>
Vaporize is your only relic removal. Try to hold them for when you REALLY need them. It tends to work better when your opponent has lots of relics in play anyways. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, you should never have to flip to Zannah. I have only had to once, and that was to a Anti-Core deck. If you do flip to her, your strategy changes. You now get one free Terrorize effect on your turn, due to Charm. You won&#39;t be able to play many of the bigger creatures that the DT could, so make the Core Grags, Koils and Wudges count. Attack often, and use Stealth to make your second attack energy-loss free also. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
