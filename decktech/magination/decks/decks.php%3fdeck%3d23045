Total: 40 Cards + 3 Magi     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="h2font"> Strategy</Font></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><font class="bfont"> This is the fifth version of this deck, adding that which Nightmare Dawn provides, dropping a few spells and adding creature or two, plus changing the lead in magi has made this a great deck for those who look to try the Weave or even begin to learn how to play Magi Nation.  It has an updated strategy section that makes it great reading for those new to the Weave.  As for what makes this deck unique amongst the Weave decks posted in the beginner category so far (to answer Arigomi&#39;s question) is it works, and it works without rares. Every card compliments each other (unlike my previous version-Tweaves and Ahdar/Drowl/Vuryips! What was I thinking?!) and works toward the goal of building a wall from which to strike from.  Now for those who are looking for a deck with &#39;Zing!&#39;  sadly this vision of the Weave is not that region. The region is built around the foundations of the Weave itself.  &quot;Grow with patience and care and you will have a killer lawn in the end, literally.&quot;  <br />
<br />
First the background, a friend of mine got into Kybars Teeth in a huge way and in the process got a rather large collection of Weave &#39;stuff&#39; he did not want. So he kindly gave me all his commons and uncommons and here is what I cooked up (with the help of all the great comments I got). The foundation of a deck should address the 5 D&#39;s of Deck Design: Damage (how you hurt them), Draw (how to get card advantage), Discard (how to keep card advantage), Defense (how to keep them from hurting you), and Disruption (fun ways to ruin their day). <br />
<br />
There are two elements that are key to winning in Magi Nation, Card Advantage (having many cards so you can have good choices) and Energy Advantage (having more energy on your side of the table), and this deck gets both. With Vuryips and Drowls you can build card advantage. Energy Advantage comes in many forms; Playing weave creatures so the Uwamar gets huge, defensive cards helping the defender (Speags, Zassyfer, Quallion), and the Magi&#39;s Effects (Quirle especially). <br />
<br />
This is a beginners deck, in that it has no rare cards in it, if you have some Weave rares look at &#39;Taking it to the next level&#39; below.  This deck does rely on some combos, so it would be a deck that I would use to hook someone who is big into &#39;strategy games&#39; into Magi-nation or who has some experience with card games. There are certainly ways to improve upon this deck (Will of Orothe, Lascinths, Weave Powder, etc. etc.). But for a way to have a pretty solid Weave Deck for nearly free, this one is hard to beat.<br />
<br />
Now to address the concerns of those who feel weave is &quot;too hard&quot; for beginners.  If some individual just walked in off the street and I had never met them, and have no idea what their skill level is or interests are (other than wanting to learn Magi Nation), I would hand them a Cald or Naroom Deck.  If on the other hand they had played other card games or strategy games I would not feel uncomfortable handing them this deck, and in fact have done so.  I did sit down with them and teach them the nuiances of the deck (and I got some valuable pointers from them on how to explain things better) and after 2 games they were very comfortable with weaving.  So I still feel this deck is perfect for the beginners category and if you are looking for a cheap &quot;litmus&quot; deck to test your deck against a Weave deck, here is a good one for you to use too.<br />
<br />
<b>Magi Notes:</b><br />
<br />
Taisa is used first.  His starting hand is incredible! His Energize rate is very solid! And his Effect is nothing to laugh at either.  No wonder this guy is the Captain of the Guard.  With the Uwamar as the first card played, followed by the rest of the pack you will have a very solid wall from which to build up cards for later use in game.  Now he replaces Ahdar as the lead magi from my previous versions of the deck.  If draw engines are rampant in your area, look at Green Grass 1.4, but really even in a draw heavy area Tasia is a great starting magi.<br />
Now about Taisa&#39;s Effect-<b>Weave:</b> <i>Whenever one of your Effects moves Energy from one of your Creatures to another, you may choose to move the energy between one of your creatures and Taisa instead.</i>  Now here is why this effect is incredibly powerful.  When a creature that has the Effect Weave attacks you can trigger Taisa&#39;s effect. Now you can choose to move energy from Taisa to the creature, move energy from the attacker to Taisa, or even draw energy from a creature not even involved in the attack that is Weave to Taisa.  You can even do the same when defending.  Throw on a Quallon which enables you to move two energy and you can see the energy just flying through the air.<br />
The advantage about this power is when you Weave normally you are weakening one creature to strengthen another, there are cards and magi who make this sacrifice less painful, but in essence that is what you are doing.  Taisa&#39;s effect enables him to be a universal battery without weakening any of your creatures.  So when playing with Taisa leave a few energy on him to help your creatures out when attacking and defending.  Knowing exactly how much to leave on him is the trick.  My rule of thumb is leave 1 energy for each creature I have in play until I have 5 creatures in play,  then I usually hold let the situation dictate what energy I hold and what I dispose of.<br />
<br />
Quirle is our second mage and is the Tryn of the Weave. Like Tryn he is free energy, with the key exception that his power triggers at the Start of EACH players turn, so in a multiplayer match some creatures become massive, especially if you put it on something like a Uwamar. The trick to remember is dont put all your eggs in one basket, spread the energy out, with weave its easy to move it around, so try not to make one big target for a Shockwave or Giant Carrillions Stomp (or, *shudder*, Essence of Naroom). Do get the Tuk Berries, and hopefully by now you have one Juntertrug in hand.  This enables you to choose if your Juntertrug attacks or not by handling its cravings.<br />
<br />
Bo´Ahsa is used last. She recieves Sawgrass, Pody, and Quallon to continue the battle. She is to summon a nice team and ensure the main force is safe from harm. With weave Tactics she has the power similar to Will of Orothe, use that to your advantage and if you have the wall of grass (Quallon, Speag, Zassyfer and something else) you can make something small suddenly very huge. In reality this is where the strongest fight and strongest defense will take place, especially if you have held onto the right cards.  This is the risk with a beginner, knowing when to hold them and when to fold...er, use what you got.<br />
<br />
Now Bo&#39;Ahsa does require some good strategy notes and thanks to the feedback a couple of combos have been noted.  As the feedback increases I will edit this section as more of these are noted:<br />
<br />
Bo&#39;Ahsa and 2 Speags walk into a bar.... When an opponent attacks a speag, grab 2e for each of them you have out.  Then force them to attack the second speag and poof they get 2e more.  Now if you are truely vile and want to see someone squirm, grab 2 gum-gums, an underneath creature that can slide behind another creature.  If their first attack goes after a its Speag, Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, now your speags heave each gained 8e, if they go Gum-Gum: its Gum-Gum, Gum-Gum, Speag, (now use her effect), Speag, just remember that gum-gums can only use their effect once to prevent an infinite energy gain with the speags and her effect triggers once per turn, but at your choosing.<br />
<br />
Bo&#39;Ahsa and the Wall of Life...Ingredients: 19 energy, 2 Speags (2e), a Quallon(3e), an Uwamar(3e), and a Zassyfer(3e).  Start with Uwamar, add remaining creatures in bowl, spend appropriate amount of energy and watch the Uwamar rise.  Choose either Pody or Sawgrass to get vengence.  Results: 1e on you and 21e in the field (if you chose Sawgrass), or 2e on you and 26e in the field(if you went with the Pody and smacked an attacker).   Now when attacked use weave tactics to make it all huge. The way to do that is move the creature to the largest one each turn. So when they attack the first turn, move them to the Uwamar, where it picks up 1e for being the defender and 2e weaved to it from the Speags. If the Uwamar can easily defeat the first attacker, weave the energy to the Quallon or Zassyfer as they have no easy way to get energy.  Now to be totally obvious, if somehow you can hold onto TWO Uwamar, Bo&#39;Ahsa becomes the monster she is destined to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bow&quot;&#39;Ahsa - With Zaya&#39;s bow in her arsenal you can draw to your wall of death creatures that your opponent would rather not have attack. This is really good if they have but one creature left in a defensive position, you force it to attack instead of giving it a rest. Good with drawing out those Ergars from Cald, or drawing the wounded creatures of your foe to their quick demise. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;The other Magi&quot;</i>  One comment I get alot is why not use Artyva or Iyori, the other uncommon magi? Well let me answer that question.  <br />
As far as Iyori, it is too easy for a new player to get in the bad habit of using her power.  And often times throws away cards that were better kept, as such I do not want to add this magi in to this deck as it relies on holding cards for later use by other magi, especially Bo&#39;ahsa.  <br />
Now Artyva, her effect can prove to be a major weed in your yard.  In short Artyva is a traitor. Yes, she is, she can cause you more grief than a new player deserves. Her effect can heal opponents creatures if you have none of your own at the end of your turn that need healing. Too often new players will assail a foe with everything they got and in the end may have a wall of fresh creatures while the opponent may have one or two wounded souls in play, and then Artyva heals them!  As such I would not encourage a new player to play Artyva, as it can too easily backfire.  <br />
Ahdar is another uncommon Magi, but his Effect is only triggered if your opponent is running a draw engine as their lead magi, and only a few regions have such Magi, so from a meta-gaming standpoint Ahdar moves from the lead Magi to the Other Magi category.  <br />
Now Nightmares Dawn introduced Ninx another solid Weave/Paradwyn Magi, but in a no-rares deck she only gets a Pajajack.  Ninx does have one scary thing going for her and that is her Power of Staredown.  She can choose any magi in play with more energy than her and reduce that player to her energy.  If you can keep her to low energy and combined with the Paradwyn Spell Bloom she has the capability for a 1st turn kill if an opponent goes second and does anything in the first Powers/ Spell/ Relic Phase (This happens about 50% of the time). She also is the answer to many of the problems this deck faces from higher level decks (Mass Removal and Specific Discard) by simply not allowing the opposing Magi a chance to build up energy to cast cataclysm or summon that annoying Ormagon.  But in hands of an inexperienced player Ninx is a deathtrap. Frequently a newplayer will bring her down to 0 energy and then fry the other magi, but in exchange leaving Ninx exposed.  In the hands of a more experienced player I might reconsider adding Ninx to the mix but for now she&#39;s one of those &quot;other magi.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>The Art of Weave (Basketweaving 101): </b><br />
<br />
First, before getting into your creatures in detail they all have (with the exception of the Juntertrug) a neat effect called Weave. This effect allows you to move one energy between a creature that is involved in an attack, with another of your Weave creatures that is not in combat. <br />
<br />
Now lets examine this closely: If your creature is attacking or attacks and has Weave you can use it. You can use it to bring one energy from ANY of your weave creatures to the one in battle to make your creature stronger, or if you are certain that this creature will not survive the attack or the subsequent round, you can Weave the energy to another creature. Where the art of Weave comes is knowing when to &quot;weave away&quot; or &quot;weave to&quot; a creature on an attack and on the defense. We will look at defense first as that is the most critical. <br />
<br />
On the Defense you want to keep your creatures alive for the following round so they can continue to use their effects. When a creature is attacked first resolve any effects from those creatures that help a defender (Speags/Zassyfers/Fluggs if fighting core) then ask yourself two questions: If I weave 1 energy to my creature, will it live or at least assure mutual destruction? If I weave 1 energy away will I make sure another creature survives a subsequent attack or at least avenge this creatures death? The Weave is dependant on keeping that wall of creatures in place and using their supporting powers/effects to gain energy to keep the energy advantage. If you answer yes to either question then that is the suggested move of energy. If you can answer yes to both, then decide what is more important killing your opponents creature now or later. If you can weave 1 energy away and still survive the attack determine if the same creature might be attacked again, those creatures that seem to draw attacks are Podys, Speags, Zassyfers, and Quallons and you might want to leave energy on them even if they could survive the attack and in fact you might even want to weave energy onto them even if they could survive the inital attack. <br />
<br />
Now on the offense. Lead with your weakest that could survive with one energy being weaved off, moving that energy to subsequent attackers or making one big attacker for the final thrust. <br />
<br />
About Juntertrugs-they dont have Weave as an effect on them, but that doesnt mean they cannot take advantage of it, they are after all Weave creatures. If it needs energy to aid in its attack make sure you send a weave creature first that can survive and send the Juntertrug an energy to help in his battle. If you are on the loosing end of a fight and the creature is going to get destroyed you might want to send 1 energy to the Juntertrug who will gladly give retribution for you. <br />
<br />
So there you have it, now lets look at your army in a bit more detail. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Creature Notes:</b> <br />
Uwamar-The great wall of the weave, this small beast can rapidly become the battery for your weave strategy. Build it up, and weave off the juice. Remember the key is not to put all your energy in one basket. <br />
<br />
Speag- This is the defense battery, and since you get to work effects in any order the common strategy is get speag its 2e, weave energy to the defender. Use the Quallon and you can move both energy to the defender, combine that with a Zassyfer and you can essentially put 3e on a defender each time its attacked. See Bo&#39;ahsa for some of her super strategies.<br />
<br />
Vuryip - Is one of the biggest critters in this deck, with 6e. The Vuryip is a great way to get more cards in your hand which is key to setting up the various combos this deck is good for. Have him hit the weaker creatures so you can get as many cards as possible from him, and remember draw cards when it attacks OR is attacked. <br />
<br />
Drowl- Your other big hitter, also comes with the bonus of 2 cards for playing it. <br />
<br />
Juntertrug-Your last big hitter, problem with this brute is it has to attack, that and it doesn&#39;t have weave.  Still each turn it attacks it gets two energy when it initiates the attack.  The solution to handling this Hunger is to feed it Tuk Berries each turn.<br />
<br />
Pody- Vengence is the name of the game for this card. Most player will try to put the smackdown on him before does it to them him so hes a great way to draw attacks off of other cards. If you have placed a Will of Orothe in your deck he becomes the hand of judgement. <br />
<br />
Zassyfer - Combine this creature with a Speag and and players will be facing a 2 to 3e stronger oppponent. <br />
<br />
Scout Bungaloo - Switching from the regular Bungaloo which had a 2e for 4e advantage (2e for attacking and 2e for its death), the Scout Bungaloo is a defensive creature now that gives a 3e for 5e advantage.  Now initially looks like a bad choice, but with the number of creatures growing that ignore damage from weak creatures (Baldar leaps to mind), instead of doing just getting smashed under these creatures hoofs, damage its better for the wall to benefit from its demise.  First it draws the attack and you get to then process the Effects in any order you want.  First weave 1e to a creature who can use it.  Then trigger the Effect flee moving 4e to a Creature of your choice.  Now this only really works if you have other creatures in play, so if your opponents are always leaving this guy for last I would suggest switching these guys for regular Bungaloos from the Dreams End Release.<br />
<br />
Quallon - If you set up the Wall of Life right you will have a Zassyfer, a Speag, and a Quallon out there with some heavy hitter. And with weave tactics it becomes very deadly. The Quallon will become a target of your opponents wrath quickly, so if the target of an attack can spare the energy and survive you might want to weave 1 energy to this critter to keep it around as long as possible.<br />
<br />
Yajo - Aside from a starting card for Taisa, this blade of grass can help keep your attackers in the fray and if not immediatly attacked can generate a huge energy advantage (9e for 3e).<br />
<br />
Blue Yajo - A strong defender, its real strength is giving strength to others.  This card replaced Sheath in my deck for several good reasons.  First is its power only prevents the card that it empowered from attacking just this turn (unlike Sheath which prevents the creature from attacking).  Second should that empowered creature die, you dont loose any cards.  It can be used to keep your Juntertrug in check, and lastly it makes a decent defender.<br />
<br />
Tweaves - Well actually there are none in here, but the number one comment I get from reviewers is &#39;Where are the Tweaves?&#39;  The thing is this deck has multiple drawing engines that take the role of the heavy hitters, Vuryips and Drowls.  What this means is there are too many ways to draw a Tweave out of the Draw step to include them in the deck.  So while they are the cool &quot;Surprise!-I have you now!&quot; of the Weave region, I could not justify keeping them when there were too many ways to get them at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
<b>Spell Notes:</b> <br />
Sawgrass- Revenge plain and simple. The Weave equivallent of Shockwave, but not as proactive. <br />
<br />
Beams of Light - I was once a huge fan of Relic Stalkers, but after seeing the need to handle small pests to make way for big attacks, the beam of light has replaced the relic stalkers of old.<br />
<br />
<b>Relic Notes:</b><br />
Weave Hut - Previously I had Uwamar Beads in here, but noticing that they only protected the magi and not your creatures I realized my mental error.  So I found a great gem in the Weave Hut.  Very very usefull against Cald, and well, lots of other spells and power too.  Now you loose it if your Magi is attacked directly and there are some creatures that do that (Night Hyren and Stagadan being two that come to mind) even if you have creatures in play.<br />
<br />
Zaya&#39;s Bow - Good for finishing off the little and weak and if they live you can force them to attack. Just remember what you shoot has to attack so you better know you can handle that particular foe.<br />
<br />
Tuk Berries - Always try to get these in play and build up your batteries (Speag and Uwamar), as when you use this card you cant attack. Combine this with a Quallon and through the effect of weave you really have 2e to give to any of your attackers. You also will find this super usefull to lockdown your Juntertrugs cravings if you need to give it a moment to rest.<br />
<br />
<b>Play Notes:</b><br />
Whether you go first or second with Taisa get that wall built right away.  With his high energize rate you should be able to keep building that great wall.<br />
<br />
If you get a Juntertrug before you get tuk berries save it for Quirlle as he gets the Berries to start.<br />
<br />
What the real trick with this deck is saving up the right cards for Bo&#39;Ahsa while putting up a solid fight with the other magi. The cards to hold onto for Bo&#39;Ahsa is Zaya&#39;s Bow, 2 Speags, an Uwamar, and a Zassyfer.  She gets a Quallon as a starting card and a couple of vengence cards (Pody and Sawgrass). <br />
<br />
<b>Meta game:</b><br />
One can say you can never be truely prepared for anything, but looking at the decks you frequently see, you can make some adjustments and still remain in &#39;beginners&#39; category (ie: no rares).<br />
<br />
If facing alot of spell heavy Arderial or Cald decks, switch out the Drowls for Frusks as you will get to draw more cards than the one time with Drowls.<br />
<br />
If facing alot of Core, switch out the Zassyfers for Fluggs.<br />
<br />
<b>Handling trouble:</b><br />
There are a few things that any deck just gets pounded by-Mass removal (Ormagons, Cataclysms, Wessigs Landslide, Xyx Elders, Core Grags, just to name a few), Specific removal (Giant Carrillion, shockwaves, tidal waves, undertows, etc.), and Rayje&#39;s Belt (a rare card that can shut down Effects, like Weave).<br />
There are a few ways to handle these problems.  First most of these cards types are rare, but there are still uncommon equivalents (Core Grags, Cataclysms, Shockwaves), so you need to find ways to over come them, and here are some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Mass Removal - If you are facing lots of mass removal, you have two choices - either add 3 Umm No! to your deck in exchange for the Scout Bungaloos or play with less exposed.  When these Mass Removal cards hurt the most, is when you have built a very long, thin wall of creatures.  Thin, meaning they all have just a few energy, long meaning you have lots.  While this would work well for most situations it means if your opponent plays one of these spells/creatures your wall goes goodbye.  To counter this you need to build a thick wall.  Start by laying your foundation of creatures you want to have around for a while.  Then play some small time attackers.  Attack with your small guys and instead of making them stronger always weave their Energy to your foundation creatures.  The goal is to get these guys up to 5 energy.  A lucky Xyx Elder could ruin your day, but on average after such an attack you will still be standing and not too much in trouble.  The reason you dont want to go above 5 is then it becomes an easy target for a Shockwave.  There is little you can do against Cataclysm and Ormagons, even an Ummm No! will only protect one of your creatures.  So the secret is do not over commit.  If you have 5 creatures in play, hold on to the others and any energy you have.  Replacing the fallen as they go, but do not over commit unless you are sure they are not playing with either of these cards, if you are playing against underneath or arderial you are certainly going to face these cards.<br />
<br />
Specific Removal - Nothing ruins a good team like loosing its star player. And thats what Shockwave and Thunderquakes, and other discards do, they cripple you when you want it least.  You either put Umm No! in exchange for the scout bungaloos, which counter these Specific Removal spells, but there is no guarentee that you will have the card nor the 4 energy on your magi when they drop the hammer on your favorite creature.  So to defend against this is keep the Energy between your creatures level.  As I have stated before time and again, do not put all your eggs in one basket.  The Weave&#39;s strength is balance through action-by attacking you can shift energy around to level your wall off.  <br />
<br />
Rayjes Belt - Oh, how this card just annoys me, fortunately Nightmares Dawn plus a MRP (Most Recent Printing) have introduced ways around this.  First this deck does already have Beam of Light which takes care of the Belt, but to add to the situation there are the Inhibitor bands introduced in Nightmares Dawn.  These are great against all those who seem to throw down a bunch of univeral relics (its also very handy against Rayje Decks).  The MRP of the Belt adds the key bit of &quot;while its in play.&quot;  It used to be the belt would continue to lock something down even if it was discarded.  Now if the Belt leaves play its lockdown ends. If you are seeing lots of Belts I would consider replacing the Tuk Berries with the Inhibitor Bands.  Then again if you have them, I would strongly suggest adding belts of your own, they are so useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Taking it to the next level:</b><br />
If you have the rares here are some suggestions. <br />
I would swap out a Bow for a Weave Powder (Its a starting card for ALL Weave Magi-use it to fetch whatever relics you need to get.)<br />
<br />
Drop the Drowls for Lascinths (If you have the Lascinths, definately take one when you get Ahdar, makes those who are brave enough to attack, pay for their mistake.  Sadly none of your cards (not even the Tuk Berry) can keep it from attacking, but then you can use the Tuk Berry to make it strong and it can attack, one choice is to keep it in hand until you get Quirle)<br />
<br />
Drop the Podys for Grass Hyren (DE-FENCE er FENSE-enough said)<br />
<br />
Drop the remaining bows for a pair of Rayjes Belts (nothing ruins a persons day when you turn off a Uwamars wait and he suddenly has to contend with a 20e critter) <br />
<br />
Drop the Blue Yajo for Will of Orothe (With this spell your deck becomes very very abusive.  Combined with Bo&#39;Ahsa and its fatal, for them.)<br />
<br />
Drop 2 Berries for two Gia Tomes (This really improves your ability to keep key cards in play-combined with Bungaloos and you can keep cycling them out, its the eebit of the Weave.)      <br />
