<br>
Barak: I think Barak is a good starter for a couple reasons. First is the fact that he is a 17/5. I also like his starting cards. A Lava Balamant with the support of an Arbolits energy is pretty good. I also like taking a thermal blast into hand. His power: &quot;Prophecy&quot; is useful in practically every deck type.<br>
<br>
Grega: Grega is the theme magi of this deck. The ability to use a thermal blast every turn is essential. I have her in the second slot because her starting energy is pretty low. I included the Grega&#39;s Ring so if you ever have enough energy you can do 2 thermal blasts. It&#39;s also there if Rayje&#39;s Belt is locking down Grega&#39;s power. A Quor Pup can also become quite powerful with the between the Arbolit, and it&#39;s power. Grega will hopefully be able to defeat at least one or two opposing magi.<br>
<br>
Vorga: Vorga is also another good magi for this deck for many reasons. She has a pretty good starting energy/energize rate. Her starting cards are also very good. Scroll of Fire is another essential card to this deck and she starts with one. You&#39;ll hopefully be pulling the Scroll out of the discard by this point in the game. I also LOVE her power. Cards such as Arderian Gaurd-Wings can hurt this deck a lot, but her power: &quot;Shatter&quot; destroys them quickly. She can also kill a creature with three of less energy. This is a great power because if they have a large creature out, and you can&#39;t kill it with a Thermal Blast, Fireball, etc. You should hopefully be able to get it down to at least 3 energy, than &quot;shatter&quot; it. <br>
<br>
The aim of this deck to wreak havoc on your opponent via spells and powers. Firefly Swarm, Lava Flow, and Fireball are essentially the same spell, just with different added bonuses. Most of the creatures in this deck, such as the Drakan play a similar role. The magi all play pretty much the same way. I tried not to include too many large creatures or spells(Flame Geyser), because you should probably be playing almost every card in your hand every turn. The idea is to put constant pressure on your opponent. <br>
<br>
Card Explanations<br>
<br>
Drakan: Drakan is essentially two thermal blasts for the price of one. He&#39;s also good if you need a moderately sized creature out<br>
<br>
Fire Chogo: The combination of his power and Scroll of Fire is very powerful. <br>
<br>
Rod of Coals: Reasoning behind this one if kind of the same as Vorga&#39;s power. If the opponent&#39;s creature has just enough to survive a fireball, this will pick him off<br>
<br>
Ergar: He&#39;s also a good creature in combination with Scroll of Fire. <br>
<br>
Giant Arboll: If left alone for a while he can become a very large creature. Hopefully he should be gaining at least 2 energy a turn<br>
<br>
Gorgle&#39;s Glasses: This should also hopefully come to use frequently. Drawing more cards helps a lot. <br>
<br>
Thunderquake: Another powerful spell that can be very effective in such a deck as this one.<br>
<br>
Thanks for looking at my deck, and I appreciate any productive criticism.<br>
