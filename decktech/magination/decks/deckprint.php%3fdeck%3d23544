Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.

<br />
<b>Word of warning:</b> It will not be immediately obvious why we chose the Magi and other cards of this deck, but I&#8217;ll explain each card choice in the Strategy section. Every card no matter how far fetched does flow into the theme of this deck. If you ha<!--544-->Ven&#8217;t already figured it out, the theme revolves around the number three and the one Cald spell in the deck. The theme also uses the number se<!--544-->Ven in some places. Remember the number se<!--544-->Ven is a holy number in a lot of Western cultures.<br />
<br />
<b>Disclaimer #1:</b> This deck doesn&#8217;t follow the formula I normally use. If we had done so there would have been aspects of this deck that wouldn&#8217;t have fit into the theme of the deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Magi:<br />
Taisa<br />
<I>Reason(s) for using as 1st magi:</I> One, his starting energy can be divided by three e<!--544-->Venly. Two, his energize rate and starting energy added together can be divided by three e<!--544-->Venly, thus the first se<!--544-->Ven of the deck is revealed. Three, he starts with all three of his starting cards.<br />
<I>Starting Cards:</I> <!--806-->Speag, <!--808-->Uwamar, <!--812-->Yajo, and two random cards.<br />
<I>Alternate 1st magi:</I> Either M&#8217;Lady <!--817-->Iyori or Ninx. However by changing the magi order you start messing with the theme of the deck.<br />
<br />
M&#8217;Lady <!--817-->Iyori<br />
<I>Reason(s) for using as 2nd magi:</I> One, when she comes out the amount her energy prior to doing anything can be divided by three e<!--544-->Venly. Two, she starts with all three of her starting cards. Three, her power of <b>Natural Selection</b> costs three energy to use.<br />
<I>Starting Cards:</I> Dasia, Weed Hyren, and Crushing <!--423-->Growth<br />
<I>Alternate 2nd magi:</I> Either Taisa or Ninx. Again, by changing the magi order you start messing with the theme of the deck.<br />
<br />
Ninx<br />
<I>Reason(s) for using as 3rd magi:</I> One, her starting energy can be divided by three e<!--544-->Venly. Two, her energize rate can be divided by three e<!--544-->Venly. Three, she starts with all three of her starting cards.<br />
<I>Starting Cards:</I> Blade Hyren, <!--803-->Pagajack, and <!--830-->Weave Mat.<br />
<I>Alternate 3rd magi:</I> Either Taisa or M&#8217;Lady <!--817-->Iyori. Once again, by changing the magi order you start messing with the theme of the deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are 21 different cards (minus magi) used to create this deck. Again 21 divided by 3 equals se<!--544-->Ven. This is the second se<!--544-->Ven seen in this deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures (27):<br />
1 Blade Hyren<br />
3 Dasia<br />
1 Fog Hyren<br />
3 Grass Etiki<br />
3 <!--803-->Pagajack<br />
3 Poison <!--501-->Baloo Root<br />
3 River <!--429-->Abaquist<br />
3 <!--806-->Speag<br />
3 <!--808-->Uwamar<br />
1 Weed Hyren<br />
3 <!--812-->Yajo<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells (7):<br />
1 Crushing <!--423-->Growth<br />
1 <!--390-->Flame Geyser<br />
2 <!--835-->Harmony<br />
3 Tropical Rain<br />
<br />
<br />
Relics (6):<br />
1 Gift of the Weave<br />
1 Ookami&#8217;s Drums<br />

<br />
I have to say this is the most ambitious deck idea I&#8217;ve come up with to date. It took me going to my good friend David &#8220;dawnstar*&#8221; McBroom for this deck to come to fruition. I do have a few strategies built into the deck that may or may not be feasible. As far as why I chose to categorize this deck as a Fun deck, well I&#8217;m fairly certain this deck couldn&#8217;t cut it as a tournament deck. However, just for fun I think I&#8217;ll play this deck in a local Magi-Nation league from time to time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Disclaimer #2:</b> Remember this deck has been posted as a Fun deck. Please rate it as such.<br />
<b>Disclaimer #3:</b> This deck wasn&#8217;t built to offend anyone&#8217;s religious beliefs. If you have an issue with this deck based on religion, please merely d-mail me. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair to trash this deck simply due to your religious beliefs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the following section of this Strategy guide will delve into the reasoning why each card was included in this deck and in some cases even a bit of strategy for the card.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><I>The three Magi:</I></b> I&#8217;ve already, in detail, explained the reasons why I used these three magi and how they fit into the deck in the magi section. Later you&#8217;ll see a particularly nasty combo with Ninx that could be hard to pull off.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Blade Hyren:</I></b> This is the first of three hyren included in this deck. It is also one of three starting cards for Ninx. When playing the Blade Hyren, remember it can combo with the Grass Etiki and all your creatures in play for an even larger Great Weave. Then add in the Staff of Vines and Blade Hyren really goes nuts. Finally (for now), if the Blade Hyren is specifically discarded from play all that energy you&#8217;ve put on it comes right back to another one of your creatures. The exception to this is if Taisa was to play the Blade Hyren. Taisa could regain the energy from the Blade Hyren if the Blade Hyren was specifically discarded.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Dasia:</I></b> The first reason why Dasia is included in this deck has to do with the fact it is one of three starting cards for M&#8217;Lady Iyori. The second reason we included the Dasia cards is because it has three abilities it can use.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Fog Hyren:</I></b> This guy is the second of three hyren included in this deck. Also, the number three can evenly divide his base starting energy. He has also been included over other hyren cards because this deck is suffering from a lack of drawing power.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Grass Etiki:</I></b> Not many things related to the number three with this little guy. However, he still makes the cut because he is part of a few three-card combos. The first combo is between him, the Blade Hyren, and any Paradwyn creature. The second combo is between him, the Robe of Petals, and any Weave creature played. The third combo is between him, the Tropical Rain spell, and any Weave creature. If there are other combos with him I can&#8217;t think of them right now.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Pagajack:</I></b> Another little guy who is included because he&#8217;s one of three starting cards for Ninx. He is also included in the deck due to his ability. If one Pagajack is already in play and you play a second Pagajack, the first one&#8217;s energy goes up to three. If you played a third Pagajack with the first two in play, the second Pagajack&#8217;s energy would go up to three.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Poison Baloo Root:</I></b> This critter can either be Dreamwarped down to a three energy creature, or you can play him for four and immediately use his ability causing him to be at three energy.<br />
<br />
<b><I>River Abaquist:</I></b> The only thing three about this guy is his base starting energy. However, due to the number of weenie creatures in this deck, the River Abaquist can become a very nasty creature.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Speag:</I></b> Another weenie that is a starting card. He is one of three starting cards for Taisa. Speag also has three abilities on it.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Uwamar:</I></b> This critter is what I call a Trinity card in this deck. One, he is one of three starting cards for Taisa. Two, his base starting energy is three. Three, Uwamar has three effects. Also, keep in mind since this is mainly a weenie deck, your Uwamar cards can grow very quickly.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Weed Hyren:</I></b> The third of three hyren in this deck. He also has three effects he can use. He is one of three starting cards for M&#8217;Lady Iyori. Finally, the number three can evenly divide his base starting energy.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Yajo:</I></b> Another Trinity card. His base starting energy of three, he has three abilities, and is one of three starting cards for Taisa.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Crushing Growth:</I></b> This is one of three starting cards for M&#8217;Lady Iyori and is one of three Weave spell cards used in this deck (the other two are two Harmony cards).<br />
<br />
<b><I>Flame Geyser:</I></b> The Holy Hand Grenade itself. This spell&#8217;s casting cost reveals the third seven in this deck. Also, this spell does three energy of damage across the board to all magi and creatures. When used in a combo with Harmony, this spell really gets nasty. Then consider what would happen if Ninx used this combo. Ninx plays the combo, then plays a Pagajack, and finally uses her Stare Down power to possibly kill off a magi.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Harmony:</I></b> There are two Harmony spells in this deck which make up two-thirds of the Weave spells in this deck. It also causes all creatures in play to lose or gain enough energy so that all creatures in play only have three energy. As I mentioned, this is a somewhat good card to use in a combo with the Flame Geyser.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Tropical Rain:</I></b> There are three Tropical Rain cards in the deck making a total of three Paradwyn spells in the deck. This spell also places three energy on a creature with Dreamwarp. Remember this is a good card to combo with the Grass Etiki.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Gift of the Weave:</I></b> Costs three energy to play. Is one of three Weave relics in the deck.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Ookami&#8217;s Drums:</I></b> One of three Paradwyn relics in the deck. One combo that was pointed out to me by Adam "Xacad" Fritz, was using the Poison Baloo Root along with Ookami&#39;s Drums to gain a bit of a energy advantage.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Robe of Petals:</I></b> One of three Paradwyn relics in the deck.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Staff of Vines:</I></b> One of three Paradwyn relics in the deck.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Weave Mat:</I></b> This card is one of three starting cards for Ninx. The Weave Mat is also one of three Weave relics in the deck. The word &#8220;Mat&#8221; is only three letters long.<br />
<br />
<b><I>Weave Hut:</I></b> This is one of three Weave relics in the deck. The word &#8220;Hut&#8221; is only three letters long.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that any region/deck that prevented your creatures from using their Weave/Dreamwarp abilities, wiped out all your creatures in one blow, and/or kept the Flame Geyser from causing the maximum amount of damage, would give this deck a lot of grief. Who cares though? As long as you&#39;re enjoying the theme of the deck it doesn&#39;t matter how badly your being beaten, and if it is still enjoyable to play when its being beaten just think how much fun you&#39;ll have when this deck is winning.<br />
<br />
Well thanks for taking a look at this deck. If you can think of any other combos for this deck, please let me know. If I really like your combo I&#8217;ll include it within the Strategy listing for this deck and give you the credit for coming up with the combo. Please limit any combos you come up with to the cards that are already in the deck. I say this because if we really had wanted to go over 40 cards or use some other cards in the place of cards in this deck, we would have already built the deck with those cards.<br />
<br />
My only regret to this deck is not figuring out a way to include three Focus cards in the deck. Of course that would have required removing three cards from the deck to make room for the Focus cards since we were shooting for a 40 card deck. In addition to that, David and I both felt the deck really would be better served if it didn&#8217;t have the Focus cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><I>Final Notes:</I></b><br />
<br />
1) I have come to realize that there is a fourth 7 in this deck. There are 7 spells in this deck. I believe that the number four is a number that represents strength.<br />
<br />
2) The deck number of this deck is 23544. If you add 2+3+5+4+4 you get the number 18 which can be divided by 2 for two 9s which can be represented as (3x3) + (3x3). So this deck has another double Trinity. This is getting silly.<br />
<br />
3) Technically, this deck did receive two ratings that were only four stars. As you can tell I deleted them. I only did this so this deck could have a good shot of getting more ratings due to it being on the top ten decks list. Now that it has gotten several five star ratings I regret deleting those two four star ratings since it would have given a better picture of how people felt about the deck.<br />
