Total: 40 Cards  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here&#39;s the basic framework for the newest Blu brokeness. <br>
<br>
Magi: Blu, and 2 others.  I run Lasada/Evu/Blu. I&#39;ve heard that Dr. Bob (who sparked this idea) runs Aula/Blu/Orothe magi. It&#39;s a preference thing. You just need to get Blu cards - either a lot of them, or the right ones, depending on your style and environment. <br>
<br>
Key cards: Pylofuf. You need him to block, to stall, and to eat all your opponent&#39;s creatures. <br>
<br>
Dream Channel: The key to this deck is a triple DC&#39;ed pylofuf, which allows you to cast, each turn: <br>
<br>
Entangle and Will of Orothe. Your opponent can&#39;t attack, can&#39;t cast spells, and can&#39;t use powers. They are fairly limited at this point. <br>
<br>
Rayje&#39;s Belt - for the powers on magi, and to let your &#39;fuf deliver a killing blow. <br>
<br>
Flood of Energy - you get 11e a turn. They get 5. <br>
<br>
Hubdra&#39;s Spear - When you&#39;ve cast FoE 6 times, you need to clear that 30e off of them. <br>
<br>
Mass removal - Ormagon, Cataclysm, what have you. Required. <br>
<br>
And finally: <br>
<br>
Weggit. Drop 11 relics with Blu, draw 11 cards as you do, pop 2 weggits. You have your deck in your hand. <br>
<br>
<br>
Blu, when he hits play, needs the following: 1-3 DC&#39;s. A pylofuf. Lossa relics. He plays the Fuf. DC&#39;s it. If you don&#39;t FoE, cast Entangle and Will of Orothe. If you do, keep going, but keep enough energy to cast them each and every turn. You just recurse those two, and have fun. <br>
<br>
That&#39;s really all it is. The specifics are really irrelevant. It&#39;s the framework that is ugly. The essence of the deck is Blu, getting Will of Orothe and Entangle each turn, and being able to cast them both each turn (through DC or the like). <br>
<br>
Your main issues are: 1. Rayje&#39;s Sword. Burrow goes Uhoh. But if they can&#39;t attack anyway... <br>
<br>
2. Rayje&#39;s Cloak. This one hurts. A lot. WoO is useless at that point. Combine with a sword, and a warrior&#39;s boots, and your fuf is very likely dead, which means you are too. It&#39;s a deck of limited means. You have 2 strengths - locking them down, and big burrowed creatures. If you can&#39;t lock them down, get yourself some 15e fufs and Ormies from Ring of Secrets, and hope. <br>
<br>
3. New magi. A new magi can cast spells, as entangle targets magi. So beware of the evilness, and prep for it. <br>
<br>
4. Sorreah. He starts with a Cataclysm, and locks down your power. You can recover from that, especially if you&#39;re set up. But be ready. Belt/Cloak/Climbing Staff will get your power back, and a lot of energy<br>
lets you redo the board. <br>
<br>
5. Chur.  You lose the game.  Go home.  Seriously.<br>
<br>
Scenario: Blu gets the 3 DC&#39;ed Fuf. You cycle your deck every turn. When you&#39;re ready to kill a magi, do the following: <br>
<br>
Get your Ormi up to 20+. Devastate. Will of Orothe. Um...No in hand. Barqua&#39;s Bubble in play. Play warrior&#39;s boots. Lockdown warrior&#39;s boots. Basically, the only thing you really fear is some playing Warrior&#39;s Boots, Rayje&#39;s Cloak, Rayje&#39;s Sword, Big creature, Warrior&#39;s Boots, Big Creature.   Not likely. <br>
<br>
Then repeat. For more fun, lock down something (like burrow), do things, stalk your own belt, draw it back, play it again, lock down something new. <br>
