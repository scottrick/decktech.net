This is a wonderful deck for beginners that&#39;s easy to learn, fun to play, and not too hard on the pocket either!  There are only three rares: The lovable friend of Furoks, Sperri...and the two sneaky Wasperines.  A few of the cards in the deck can be found in the Dreams End &quot;Core&quot; preview deck available for purchase or animite redemption on the Magi-Nation website...<br>
<br>
For Purchase:<br>

<br>
For Animite Redemption:<br>

<br>
These cards include the following:<br>
Evil Evu, Wasperine, Chaos Plith, Rayje&#39;s Sword, as well as many other useful cards for future play.  Not only that, but you also receive two copies of each card, providing you w/ two of your three rares already!  Sperri may be more of a challenge to find, but that&#39;s what collecting is all about, right?:)  Should you not be able to find her I&#39;d recommend replacing her w/ Tryn.<br>
<br>
STRATEGY:<br>
This deck is pure aggression.  You play your creatures and you attack w/ them. Yes, it&#39;s that simple, yet it works!:)  Your first magi rewards you for defeating creatures by allowing you to draw cards...your second magi allows each of your creatures to attack twice...while your final magi can play huge Furoks which, you&#39;ll soon realize are the gift that keeps on giving!:)  Your spells shift the energy in battle to your favor, while your relics give your creatures a boost of energy, as well as allowing them to attack more often and insure the maximum amount of damage.  If you&#39;re new to the game, the following player&#39;s guide will help you to grasp some the fundamentals as well as provide a few tips for maximum gameplay.<br>
<br>
PLAYER&#39;S GUIDE:<br>
EVIL EVU:<br>
Evu is a wise Naroom magi who recently was corrupted by the evil magi of the Core.  Because Magi-Nation is a game that is heavily influenced by its epic storyline, many of the changes within the story are reflected in the game.  Evu has a pure Naroom magi card as well, giving you the option of playing good or bad, but never both.  Any card marked w/ an &quot;alternate&quot; such as &quot;alternate Evu&quot; beneath the card title is considered the exact same card as its conterpart for deck construction.  Therefore, we can only play w/ one Evu in our deck, so we must choose between the good or the bad Evu.  Fortunately for us, the bad Evu is stronger and isn&#39;t as rare as the good one!:)  Another example of this are the Pliths in the deck.  We have one Chaos Plith and two Naroom Plith.  Since the Chaos Plith is marked as an &quot;alternate Plith&quot; we cannot add another Plith of either name because we have reached our limit of three.  You&#39;ll encounter cards like these often in the game, so it&#39;s important to take note of their exceptions.  Evil Evu is considered a Naroom Shadow magi, which would normally mean he is a Core magi and can only play Core cards as well as cards that specifically say &quot;Naroom Shadow Magi may play this card.&quot;  However, Evil Evu is somewhat stronger than the other Naroom Shadow magi because the text on his card says that he can play all Naroom cards w/o a penalty or restriction.  This is great because it gives you the option of playing Evil Evu in a pure Core deck, a pure Naroom Deck, or a mixture of both!<br>
<br>
On your typical first turn, you will look through your deck and take out the Chaos Plith and a Furok for starters and draw three more cards to bring your hand to five.  The reason we&#39;re taking the Chaos Plith and not the Naroom Plith is the Chaos Plith allows Evil Evu to draw a total of three cards everytime it defeats another creature in battle.  The Naroom Plith only allows you to draw two when it&#39;s attacked and possibly a third if it defeats the creature as well.  Although both are beneficial to you, Evil Evu is the only one who can play the Chaos Plith w/o a penalty.  Because the Chaos Plith is a Core creature that can be played by Naroom magi, it&#39;s considered to be out of region for Naroom magi, therefore, Yaki and Sperri will have to pay a regional penalty of 1 energy in addition to the 5 energy it costs to play the Chaos Plith.  The Chaos Plith would come into play w/ 5 energy and the addtional 1 energy for the penalty is discarded.  So it&#39;s best to let Evil Evu play the creature w/o penalty and leave the cheaper Naroom Pliths for your other magi if he doesn&#39;t draw them first.  Just remember to pay the penalty should you draw the Chaos Plith again w/ either of your other two magi.<br>
<br>
Now, let&#39;s take a look at Evil Evu&#39;s effect and what it means:<br>
Effect - Devour: Whenever an opposing Creature is discarded from play or reduced to zero energy by one of your cards, draw a card.<br>
<br>
What this means is, as long as Evil Evu is your magi:<br>
-Everytime you attack an opposing creature and defeat it...draw a card<br>
<br>
-Everytime an opposing creature attacks one of your creatures and that opposing creature is defeated as a result...draw a card<br>
<br>
-Everytime your Giant Carillion uses it&#39;s power &quot;Stomp&quot; to discard a creature...draw a card<br>
<br>
-Everytime you use the spell Tap Roots and you happen to remove all of the energy from the creature you chose...draw a card<br>
<br>
The Pliths also give special privaledges to Evil Evu, allowing him to draw more cards w/ them than other magi.  It&#39;s easy to forget to process your effects when you first start to play...and even veterans such as myself tend to forget at times.  So remember to pay close attention to the effects of your creatures as well as those of your magi to maximize your card drawing.  Drawing cards is an essential part of winning in the game of Magi-Nation.  You will often find that the player who draws his deck will win the game.  This is why Evil Evu is an excellent choice to begin w/...essentially drawing cards for doing what you&#39;re supposed to do anyway...fight!<br>
<br>
After you have your opening hand, play the Chaos Plith as well as the Furok and perhaps another 2 energy creature such as a Bungaloo or Eebit and end your turn.  Continue to play creatures w/ the aid of your Robe of Vines and Warrior&#39;s Boots, but be sure to hold on to any other Furoks drawn...they are for Sperri.  Don&#39;t forget to keep the four examples above in mind to maximize your card drawing...and be sure to save at least one Warrior&#39;s Boots for your second magi...<br>
<br>
YAKI:<br>
Yaki is the &quot;Macho Man&quot; of Vash Naroom!  No really, he thinks he&#39;s Randy Savage...not to mention Hulk Hogan and Rick Flair!  Just look at the flavor text on the Arboll and Tap Roots!:)  Anyway, Yaki is pretty self explanatory.  His effect-&quot;Double Strike&quot; allows all of your creatures to attack twice each turn...so if you have an opportunity to defeat two creatures w/ only one of yours...why wait!?  Knock &#39;em out!  When you reveal Yaki, pull all four of his starting cards, checking the discard first before searching your deck.  Play a Robe of Vines followed by a Warrior&#39;s Boots and then one of the many creatures in your hand that can defeat at least two of your opponent&#39;s creatures, taking advantage of &quot;Double Strike.&quot;  If you&#39;re lucky enough to be playing against a Core deck, a Tillant will usually be enough to win you the game...especially w/ Yaki!  So even if you draw one w/ Evil Evu, it&#39;s best to save at least one Tillant for Yaki if your playing against Core.  You&#39;ll be glad you did!  If any of your creatures aren&#39;t big enough to handle two attacks in a row, then use your Grow spell as well as any Tap Roots you may have to swing the odds in your favor.  Be sure to hold onto the Furok Yaki gets as a starting card for Sperri.  She will need all three of them to get the maximum amount of energy.  Should you get all three of them into your hand w/ Yaki, feel free to play one because Sperri will get it back as a starter.  Otherwise, try to avoid playing them at all costs...because if Yaki doesn&#39;t get the job done, here comes the one and only &quot;Furok Fanatic&quot;...<br>
<br>
SPERRI:<br>
MmmMmmMmm...dang that girl is fine!  Forget Zannah...Sperri can &quot;Charm&quot; me anytime!!!  If only I could be a Furok so she could ride my back arou...err..ehem, &#39;scuz me...got a little distracted there! =P  Anyway, Sperri is a great magi to finish w/ for several reasons:<br>
<br>
1.  Because of Sperri&#39;s effect-&quot;Infuse&quot; allowing her to add two additional energy to any Furok she plays...having saved three Furoks and a Robe of Vines, Sperri can put all three Furoks into play w/ 7 energy a piece for a total of 21 energy at a cost of only 12 energy to her!<br>
<br>
2.  Should she lose one of her furry friends, she can pay 2 energy to use her power &quot;Preserve&quot; to bring a Furok back from the discard to your hand to be played again!  Keep in mind that she only energizes for 5 energy and can&#39;t afford to &quot;Preserve&quot; a Furok and play one every turn if you don&#39;t plan ahead.  Try to leave at least 1 energy if not 2 energy on her at the end of every turn.  You also have the option of attacking w/ one of your Furoks already in play allowing their effect-&quot;Retrieve&quot; to give half of the energy they lose back to Sperri.  See how much they love you!<br>
<br>
3.  The Fird Stone&#39;s effect-&quot;Fird Favor&quot; allows you to pay 2 energy whenever one of your opponent&#39;s powers or spells affects any of your Furoks in play and that power or spell doesn&#39;t affect them at all!  Just remember to save her some energy at the end of each turn and your furry friends are practically invincible!:)<br>
<br>
And that&#39;s all you really need to know to play w/ Sperri.  Keep the &quot;Furok Factory&quot; working overtime and your loyal pets will do the rest!<br>
<br>
FINAL NOTES:<br>
-Weebos work wonders w/ Giant Carillions...allowing you to discard a creature w/ the Giant Carillion&#39;s power &quot;Stomp&quot; and then use the Weebo&#39;s power &quot;Vitalize&quot; to restore it to 8 energy.  That means you discarded one of their creatures for only 2 energy!  Doesn&#39;t get any better than that!  Try to play them both w/ a Robe of Vines in play to keep the Weebo alive and possibly grow him the next turn to do the combo again!<br>
<br>
-Wasperine is wonderful surprise that will catch many opponents off guard.  Its effect-&quot;Rush&quot; allows you to play the Wasperine at the beginning of your attack step so that you can attack w/ it as if it were already in play!  However, since it is played at the beginning of your attack step you can&#39;t use any powers or spells to make it bigger before attacking.  So remember to play any powers, spell, or relics that you need before playing the Wasperine using its &quot;Rush&quot; effect.  Once you process its effect, your first powers, spells and relics step is over, and you must begin attacking immediately or else proceed to the next step.  To get the most out of the Wasperines, play them w/ a Robe of Vines in play and try to save them for Yaki to surprise a defenseless magi!<br>
<br>
-Rayje&#39;s Sword is valuable relic in the current environment.  It&#39;s effect-&quot;Piercing&quot; doesn&#39;t allow spells, powers, or effects to reduce energy loss.  As a beginner you will encounter several Kybar&#39;s Teeth as well as Underneath decks that have effects such as &quot;Invulnerability&quot; and &quot;Burrow&quot; that can severely reduce the energy their creatures lose in battle.  Rayje&#39;s Sword puts an end to their defense at no cost to you, because you have no spells, powers, or effects that reduce your energy loss.  Even against more advanced decks, you&#39;ll encounter the horror of a Naroom magi that is Zannah and an adorable Cald creature named Braggle (not that I&#39;m biased or anything! =P ) who are capable of losing absolutely &quot;nothing&quot; in battle!  But w/ Rayje&#39;s Sword by your side, they&#39;ll soon be pet food!;)<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
I hope you find this deck a joy to play and develop the experience to build upon it&#39;s strategy and make it even more competetive.  My suggestions for improvement would be:<br>
<br>
-Replacing the Rudwots w/ the Naroom creature Nodj...who can conveniently be found in the &quot;Core&quot; preview deck as well!<br>
<br>
-Replace the Arboll w/ a third Wasperine<br>
<br>
-Replace the two Plith and one of the Fird Stones w/ three Energy Bands<br>
<br>
Well, as Yaki would say...&quot;Enjoy the deck brother...wooo!, dig it!&quot; :)<br>
