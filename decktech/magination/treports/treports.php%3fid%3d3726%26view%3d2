I started collecting Magi-Nation about three months ago. I’ve been a die-hard SW:CCG gamer and was looking to dabble in a new game since Decipher had lost the license. Lord of the Rings TCG is a great game but doesn’t seem to hold the diversity that I like in a game. Wizard’s new Star Wars TCG is fast and furious but doesn’t appeal to me either. I wanted a game that wasn’t all about the deck building (as I saw LOTR) and wasn’t just all about luck (which I see the new SWTCG being with the build phase and dice). I had heard about Magi-Nation from Decktech and figured I’d give it a stab. If nothing else, it had some nice artwork on the cards. <br>
<br>
So I dropped in a local shop on a Saturday and saw a MND tourney actually running. I didn’t have too much time to check it out but was able to talk with the tournament director and she pointed me to a Cald and Arderial starter to try out the game. I messed with those and picked up a box of Duel Unlimited starters off eBay soon after and started to have a ball. I have a 12-year old brother who lives with me and he ate the game up as well. So I go on an eBay-fest and start building a quick MND collection. Three complete sets of commons and uncommons from Awakenings and Nightmare’s Dawn with a few starters and single rares here and there and I have a fairly modest set. Don’t have too much trade fodder to burn through, but I can put together a couple viable decks.<br>
<br>
While I’ve been collecting and I hadn’t seen a tournament posted for the Salt Lake City area. I had to work during the Storyline tournament (DOH!) and wasn’t seeing a tournament available that I wouldn’t have to drive 50+ miles for. Finally I see one posted for a place called Century Magic. Never been to the store but for a chance to play against someone else’s decks (and collections), I set out with a dreamwarping Paradwyn deck based heavily on Van’s Paradwyn Power deck. My brother Luke took his beloved Kybar’s Teeth deck that runs Kazm, Ullig, and Wessig with the Spear action (I’ll post that one later. It’s actually not bad AND one of our own creations). We even dragged along Steven our neighbor to play. He ended up taking our Naroom deck that was pretty fierce on the growing energy action as Naroom tends to be. <br>
<br>
So we head down to the tournament and find 17 players ready to throw down. I tease Luke that if he runs the table with Kybar that I’d by Rootbeer Floats for the three of us. He chuckles and is presumptuously planning on how big the float has to be. It’s our first tourney so I’m not too worried about it at this point. As they play there is one young kid around 10 years old who is hammering me to trade my foil Rock Hyren. It’s my only one and its in Luke’s deck. Luke would kill me if I traded his favorite dream creature away. This kid pesters me through the whole tourney. I do end up trading a Rockslide Hyren for a Mushroom Hyren with him only to realize that Mushroom is uncommon and Rockslide is rare. Doh! I let it go and figure I’ll get something out of him later. Pairings are called and we get ready to play.<br>
<br>
Here’s the details to the games:<br>
<br>
Game 1: Me vs. Jacob Meyer’s Kybar Teeth deck.<br>
<br>
Jacob is there with a couple friends and it seems like it’s his first actual tourney. He goes first and is running a huge Kybar deck (probably about 60 cards) with a magi combo of Hok/Wessig/Kazm. Hok keeps my opening hand Shockwave from being used for awhile and we battle back and forth for a bit. I finally get set with a Warrior’s Boots and Shockwave combo to off his two creatures on my next turn. He whittles away my creatures until I only have 2 creatures left and give me my chance. Shockwave takes his Giant Balder since Hok’s gametext no longer hurts me with 2 on 2. I use the Boots to get a Vine Hyren into play and plow through to take down Hok. Wessig shows up and I play conservative for a bit. It takes me a bit but I’m finally able to unseat Wessig without deploying too many creatures (I think I lost about 4 creatures to her Landslide effect) though I do lose Arawan by having 0 energy at the time. Kazm comes out for him and I follow with Ookami. It was an interesting battle back and forth. Ookami was adding energy to creatures and such but Kazm would get such a boost from my deploying smaller creatures and is able to bring in enough big backup to hold me back. I’m taking too much time trying to figure out whether to sacrifice Ookami to bring in a bit more firepower. While we are playing the draw goes on until time is called. Timed Win. 2 Magi.<br>
<br>
Props: Kazm for being a great finisher Magi. He’s just tough to dislodge.<br>
Slops: Me for not willing to sacrifice Ookami to push for a decisive win.<br>
<br>
Update on the Boys: Luke’s Kybar deck trounced a Dark Twin Core deck rather handedly with only Kazm going down. Guess that Cleansing I put in at the last minute worked out well. Steven loses his game but took his opponent down to the last magi as well. It was a tight game and well played from the sound of it. <br>
<br>
Little kid comes back at me. Wants to trade 3 rares for my Rock Hyren. Not interested dude. He just won’t take no for an answer.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Me vs. Daniel Burke’s Cald burn madness deck.<br>
<br>
Daniel’s is a friendly guy who’s in his 20s. That makes him more on my age level. He’s pretty serious as we sit down and start playing. He’s going with a Vorga/Nara/Gar lineup. Vorga is able to plow through Arawan rather quickly. I’m making a bunch of timing mistakes and being “tournament newbie” all over the place. Daniel plays it cool and helps me through a few things and doesn’t mind what would probably be called stalling by any experienced gamer. However, since I truly was a newbie, I was grateful for his help and pointers. Unfortunately, this also gave him a fake sense of security. While I’m a newbie at Magi-Nation tournaments, I also know a few things about playing and Ookami comes out with a vengeance. Vorga doesn’t hold for more than a turn and Nara and her Jiles fall to a heavy blast of self-perpetuating energy from Ookami and Lireil’s Capes doing their job. Daniel realizes he is on the ropes but still feels confident about where he stands. Gar gets set with a two dream creatures of 9 and 10 power respectfully. I only have two creatures out as well. Oops, another Warrior’s Boots (foily this time) came out and I snag him hard with an additional Vine Hyren and a Shockwave to finish his last two dream creatures and the game. Full win. 2 Magi.<br>
<br>
Uber-Props: Daniel was a great sportsman. He worked through my timing mistakes, was patient and gave me some pointers. <br>
Props: Ookami. There’s just all kind of sick things about him, his drums, Lahalous and the free energy cascade they can throw at you.<br>
Slops: Me for stumbling through the game showing off my “newbie”-ness. Sorry about that Daniel.<br>
<br>
Update on the Boys: Steven wins his first tourney game with Naroom. Had a Furok, Leaf Hyren and a Wasperine all with energy in the teens with a fully loaded Tryn pull out the win. Luke also pulls out a 3 Magi win over a guy playing a Hyren deck. Maybe I will have to buy rootbeer floats!<br>
<br>
I end up trading for a few cards between games and try to flesh out my collection a bit more. Plenty of people to trade with and the store’s single binder was even a reasonable place to trade with. Century Magic was really showing that it is a player’s place to be. Little kid comes back again. Wants to give me 6 rares for my foil Rock Hyren. He’s digging deep and I tell him he’s finally tempting me but the answer is still no.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Me vs. James Carlson’s Hyren deck.<br>
<br>
James is a younger guy wearing one of those Magi-Nation baseball caps you see on the 2I website. I ask him if he bought it there and he actually got it for placing 3rd at the last tournament. I think that is pretty good but also know that his deck is the Hyren creation that my brother just burned through. The tournament director has us pull starting cards before revealing our magi and I see that all of his cards are Orothe. I may be a tourney newbie but I know a Hyren deck with Orothe means Voda is coming out first! I pray for a lucky dice roll and do indeed win it to go first. Vine Hyren is pulled with Arawan and dreamwarped it up to 8. With a Hardshell Weebo and a Tropical Rain during the second P/S/R phase I’m able to get the Vine Hyren up to a 12. My only fear now was if he somehow was able to play a Darkbreed Hyren from somewhere and snake my Vine Hyren from me. Ah the fears of an over-educated newbie! Reef and Coral Hyrens come out but there is no way either is going to outgrow my Vine Hyren. With that, Voda feeds my Hyren instead of his for a couple turns until I’m able to crunch through him. Yerthe comes next to cause some headache but Arawan pulling whatever dream creature I need is proving too much for the Hyren deck. I’ve got Yerthe against the wall and throw out all the cards I was holding for Ookami in a push to win with three Magi. Yerthe goes bye-bye and his last Magi comes up. This is kind of sad… I can’t remember which Magi it was… The Magi (I think it was Pruitt) came up and went down so quick that I’m not sure who it was. James played a Monarch Hyren and a Forest Hyren. I took both out on the next turn by using Shockwave on his Monarch Hyren and Ambush on his Forest Hyren to leave his poor Magi high and dry before my still pumped Vine Hyren and 3 other Dream Creatures. I made it as quick and clean as possible. Full Win. 3 Magi.<br>
<br>
Uber-Props: Eric. He knew that once I had that Vine Hyren up it was going to be a tough game. He stayed in it with a good attitude throughout though. He was even willing to still trade with me afterwards!<br>
Props: Power 12 Vine Hyren on first turn against Voda. Very nice!<br>
Slops: Can not getting to play Ookami be considered a slop? I didn’t think so….<br>
<br>
Update on the Boys: Well, the rootbeer floats won’t have to be purchased after all. Luke went up against Ryan Dietz’s Core deck and learns the folly of using Ullig. Ryan was able to reduce Ullig’s energize rate to 1 through a nasty combo and didn’t finish her off until he had quite the little army of dream creatures ready to take on Luke’s third magi. Once Ryan did take out Ullig, Luke didn’t have a Ritual Spear in hand to be able to slaughter him with Wessig. The float money is still mine. Steven plays a good game against Daniel Burke but runs head first into the that beauty of a Cald creation Braggle. Steven isn’t able to unseat  the troublesome creature with his Naroom only deck and can’t draw a strong enough spell or his third Giant Carillion to save his life. He walks away having a blast though.<br>
<br>
Final: Well, my first Magi-Nation is done. We originally were going to go 4 rounds but a couple people had to leave and we started just late enough that it didn’t make too much sense. I would have liked to try a go at Ryan Dietz’s Core deck but end up leaving in 2nd place behind him. No shame in that I guess. Ended up walking away with a 10 Animite card and a Promo Drush for my efforts. The store owners and tournament director were pushing to set up additional tournaments and league schedules and we were able to give our two bits in on timing. Great store with a great drive to make the players happy. Anyway, on to the end stuff….<br>

Final Props and Slops:<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
* Jason Nelson for running a great tournament.<br>
* Michael Bass and Century Magic for letting us run rampant in their store. Great Place you guys have there!<br>
* Van for making the Paradwyn deck. Very inventive and cooler than cool.<br>
* Ookami for being bombad with the energy generation. He might seem like a surfer dude but he’s got it where it counts!<br>
* Luke for almost running the table with Kybar’s. I was getting worried there.<br>
* Steven for hangin tough and having fun.<br>
* Daniel Burke for putting up with my Newbie nerves.<br>
* Me! For going undefeated and taking second!<br>
* Everyone who showed up. 17 people made it more than worth coming.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
* Me for the newbie nerves. Nothing is more embarrassing.<br>
* Me for giving myself props!<br>
* Little annoying trader kid. No means no kid. Unless you pop it up to 10 rares!<br>
<br>
Well, Thanks for reading. It’s a beast of a report for only three games. But it’s my first report and I wanted you guys to get to know me a bit. Will post the Kybar deck soon.<br>
