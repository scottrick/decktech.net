She is the manager of the store, but was not there for the whole thing as it was actually ran by another WotC employee Shawn. (Sorry, but I don&#39;t know the last names of many of the people) The tournaments start from around 6-6:30 and average around 16 players.  New people are always showing up and good turnout = more fun.  Because of the starting times, the top 2 are usually decided by the last two people with Undefeated records playing each other for the top spot. For the storylines and when time is allowing, the top four enter a final round of single elimination. The rest of the players are ranked according to each players win/loss record with the computer using a system to sort the skill level of their opponents win/loss record as a tie breaker. In other words, if you lose to someone who one wins one game, you will be ranked lower than a person you has one loss but was beat by a person who has won more than games. In the end it all usually works out. My advice is that if you are going to complain about being ranked fourth instead of fifth or second instead of third, you should have won more games(it has happened to me enough times where if I do not go undefeated I figure I have no room to complain). Unfortunately I did not get to play against Wargamer, but I will try and challenge him this weekend. Enough with the ranting, on with the dual report:<br>
<br>
Attendance: Not sure but more than 16<br>
Format: Constructed Base through Dreams End(pre-errata)<br>
Rounds: 4(Actually I played 5 rounds and so did Kristen Aiken because we were both undefeated after 4 rounds of play)<br>
<br>
Round 1: OK, here is where I apologize. I do not remember my first round. I remember the opponent and that it was the first time I ever saw him, but I forget the Magi and even the region I was playing against. I wasn&#39;t planning on writing this and in the first round I was trying to finish off a few trades before the tournament started so I was pretty distracted. To be honest I do remember that it was not an easy win, but at the same time it was not that rough of a match either. My record 1 and 0.<br>
<br>
Well I guess it is about time I said what deck I was using, having won two of the previous tournaments with Arderial and then Orothe (not consecutive tournaments as I can&#39;t always make it and don&#39;t always win), I decided that I would try to make a completely new deck that was unlike anything that was winning the tournaments. So my options were to not use Arderial(Delia Sorreah Ora etc) Weave(Kesia, Bo&#39;Asha, Zaya/Kolte) or Core(Dark Twins with any railing Magi). I have always liked Cald and Kybar&#39;s but haven&#39;t been able to manage a deck I could deem tournament worthy with them yet. I love my Orothe deck but as I mentioned have already used it to win, and as I will mention in a second will NOT be able to win again. So I decided to concentrate on Naroom and Underneath. Quickly I realize I would need to have all the Magi be of the same region to share relics, so I went with the more obvious choice of Naroom Magi.<br>
<br>
I really like this deck and am probably going to use it at Gen Con so I am hesitant to post a deck list, but the summary is this: Tryn, Pruitt, Ohk. There are very few Naroom cards in the deck. I have the Energy bands to add extra energy and the starting cards for my Magi just so that I have something to draw in the case of discard. The bulk of my deck was three of each &quot;outstanding&quot; creature and Umm.nos to keep them in play. The outstanding creatures IMHO are the Cald Braggle, Arderial Flutter Yup, and the Underneath Pylofuf. I added the Ancestral flutes so I could get all of each creature that I drew into. Other helping cards were Dream Channel and Nightmare Channel (remember pre-errata) and of course some Rayje&#39;s Belts and Warrior boots. To round out my 40 card deck I added Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel for discard protection and MetaGame cards cycling and to get more on the Underneath side of things I included some Ormagons for destruction, Ghost Bwisps so my `Fuf&#39;s could attack and Athiks for stopping Core (which I knew I would face).<br>
<br>
Round 2: Steve/Dark Twins, Evil Evu<br>
One of the reasons I built this deck was to be able to stop Kristen&#39;s Dark Twins deck, which wins Tournaments with relative ease and is the best Core deck I have ever seen. For that reason I included Athiks to drain off the DT&#39;s extra energy, and it just so happened that this technique works well against all Core players, so pre-game his deck is at a disadvantage since I meta-gamed against Core. I was surprised when Steve announced he was going to go first before we rolled to decide as I was not expecting him to play the Dark Twins, he is a very talented Core player, but I have not seen him use Twins up until that point. He started with some Wudges and I started out with a Braggle and a Flutter Yup. I used Tryn and Energy Band to pile energy on my creatures, but Steve had a card up his sleeve. In his third turn with use both still on his first Magi he dropped his Rayje&#39;s Sword. Before his onslaught he had a huge amount of energy on his Magi and only two creature in play and I had a Yup with two Nightmare channels(the only time during the tournament where the new rulings would have affected my deck as I rarely play more than one <br>
since they stop affecting once the Magi is defeated, but it wasn&#39;t being that effective anyway) for his Twins, but he crushed my creatures and left my Magi with 2 energy left as he ran over my now useless outstanding creatures and proceeded to play 6 creatures with his store of energy. It was looking pretty bleak and I was almost done, but I pulled a Rayje&#39;s Belt and managed to beat the Twins down slowing as I Belted Piercing and played a Pylofuf to stay alive with Pruitt after Tryn fell under the might of the twins. Thankfully I drew an Ormagon the turn before Tryn fell. When Pruit came out I used the Ormagon to clear the board but keep the Ormagon in play as I used Pruit to add some extra energy to him. Playing it safe I only played the Ormagon and left the extra energy on Pruit in case his next Magi was Harror with the Cataclysm. His next Magi was Evil Evu and he was not able to defeat my three energy Ormagon on his last turn, so I would have not energized and use Pruitt&#39;s robe to give it an additional five, but I remember that I didn&#39;t play it because I was afraid it would get destroyed. A few turns later and I got an Athik but the Ormie was already gone. In the end finished off Evu with a huge FlutterYup. My record 2 and 0.<br>
<br>
Round 3: Emily/Sperri,Yaki, Zannah<br>
Sorry to ruin any surprise, but this was the roughest game I had all night. She had a finely tuned Naroom deck which I had yet to play against, and this is pre-Zannah errata. Side note: Emily is Kristen&#39;s daughter. She won the die roll and opted to go second which also surprised me. I played Tryn and only got her Grow as a starting card. I played a Carillion and forgot to give it the extra two from the Refresh before I drew my two cards. I realize that if I didn&#39;t start playing smart quick I was going to be out of the running for first place. She flipped over Sperri and played a Robe of Vines and a Furok. After a few turns we are about equal, but I draw my Energy Band and Braggle. I already had a Dream Channel and Ancestral Flute and Warriors boots in my hand so Boot in a Braggle change it to Naroom and give it energy from Tryn and the Band I also used the Flute to get my other two Braggles. My now 7 energy Braggle runs across and takes out Sperri&#39;s last creature leaving her at 1 energy that I can not seem to get rid of. I had 5 Energy on Tryn and an Umm...No in my hand along with the Braggles and a Vinoc. I decided to save the energy for the Umm...No since she was energizing to 6 and would probably use a Shockwave if she had one to move on to the next Magi and get rid of my Giant Braggle. I was right and she was mighty disappointed when she lost Sperri for what turned out to be no gain. That was her biggest mistake of the game, but being in her situation I probably would have done the same thing since no one really plays with Umm..No&#39;s. She drew her two cards and it was my turn. With the five energy on Tryn I decided to play the Vinoc and balance my energy out not knowing what would come next. She revealed Yaki and got her starting cards. Since my Braggle did not attack on the last I did not morph it into Naroom. That was my second big mistake. Yaki stared by playing another Robe of Vines and a Water of Life. She then used Warriors Boots to play a Giant Carillion to stomp my Vinoc which also had seven energy, Hyren&#39;s Call a Forest Hyren to give energy back to the Carillion and used a Wasperine at Four Energy to Double Strike at Tryn after the GCarrillion attacked my Braggle. No more Tryn and we are both on our second Magi. I played Pruitt her Robe, and Rayje&#39;s Belt and the rest of my Braggles and used the my own Belt to Lockdown Lockdown since I knew that Emily had a belt in her hand. The turn before Yaki used an Orwin&#39;s Gaze to get back a Rayje&#39;s Belt that Sperri had lost. After a few more close turns, Yaki fell and Zannah came up to bat. Again I locked down lockdown because I had my own belt in play, which tends to be the only thing I use it for. Note to self, make sure that Zannah gets errata&#39;d, she is way to good, oh wait that does happen in a few days. In the last few turns Zannah put forth a wonderful defense, but her 5 energy creatures were also not removing anything from my Flutter Yups when they made the first attack to negate Zannah&#39;s Charm effect. In the very last turn I used a Tap roots to negate charm and sent the stampede in to finish the job. My record 3 and 0.<br>
<br>
Round 4: I forget his name but/Elios, Sorreah, Nimbulo<br>
Again I lost the roll and he made me go first. During this match I played it safe and the Umm..No&#39;s made a huge difference as I expected. Those darn Alaban&#39;s were a pain in the butt though. This was the first time that I saw someone use the relic Eyes of Arderial, but I thought it was more effective for me to not play Grow than it was for him to never be able to play the Sorreah&#39;s Dreams to copy the Alabans Undream. He hung in there for a long while with Elios, but after Tryn fell, Pruitt came back with a vengeance to use her Robe to give the creatures energy despite Sorreah and also managed to keep enough on the board to take out Nimbulo. I had an extra Umm.No in my hand when he lost Sorreah and I asked him why he didn&#39;t cast Cataclysm, and he said that he had them in his deck but didn&#39;t draw any yet. Note: when Sorreah was flipped over, he had already play 2 spells with Elios, so he had to go and get those. I would say that was his only big mistake. At one point is was a Yup vs. Yup battle with no energy loss, but I used a 4 energy Braggle to Morph down to three and hit for three and a Vinoc to end that lock. My record 4 and 0.<br>
<br>
Now since I was 4 and 0 and Kristen was also 4 and 0, since we both finished our games before the time for round 4 was up we started a fifth round with just us immediately. The reason I could not play the Orothe deck is because of Kristen&#39;s Dark Twins Deck. She goes first and Entombs my Submerge and Shell. While I do have Mantle of Shadows in that deck, the inability for O&#39;qua to use Submerge on Summoned Abaquists hurts me pretty badly. Also she knows every trick that my Orothe deck has, so whenever I play her with it I lose about 80% of the time. Anyway, her deckbuilding and playing skills are what I tend to build my deck to beat, but that still doesn&#39;t mean that I do it consistently.<br>
<br>
Round 5: Kristen:Dark Twins/Morag<br>
Kristen goes first and grabs 2 Entombs and a Borgor as her starting cards. She, having watch me play her daughter in Round 3 grabbed the Borgor to use against my Large Yups and Braggles, and immediately Entombed Shockwave so she could use it herself and Umm..No so that I could not use it to stop her discards. She played 3 average creatures and left plenty of energy on her Magi as it became my turn. I got Grow as a Starting Card, shuffled my deck and let her cut it. Kristen cut the deck and I proceeded to draw 4 more cards.  For the first time ever in a Magi-Nation game I felt like starting over a new game from scratch. I never felt so bad with a starting hand that I did not want to continue, but since this was the last game and all I went forward with the pure evil that I drew as a starting hand. I quickly apologized to Kristen in advance for what I was about to do, and energized Tryn, went straight to the bring in Creatures Phase and played both an Ormagon and an Athik. My starting hand was Grow, Ormagon, Braggle, Pylofof, Athik. After playing the two creatures I used Tryn&#39;s Refresh to add two more energy to the Ormagon before I used both Ormie&#39;s Devastate and Athik&#39;s Smite. With no more Dark Twins and I with a 2 Energy Ormagon and a 4 energy Athik ended my turn and drew 2. On her turn she flipped over Morag, but it only took two more turns to finish him off since if Kristen let Morag keep any energy my Athik would just get rid of it. She did manage to Dark Ayebaw my Ormie her first turn with Morag, but with the amazing and best starting hand I started with, there was really nothing that she could do to turn the tides. Our Round 5 was over just minutes after the Round 4 was over. My record 5 and 0.<br>
<br>
As for the prizes, I got an color signed art of Voda, and Kristen got the same for Tony Jones. We both got a foil Gia, and I am pretty sure that the highest ranking junior player got a foil Gia as well. On top of that I got the 25 Animite Stagadan card and first pick from the stack of foils and rares, and Kristen got the 10 Animite Korremar/Ogar card and second pick from the stack of foils and rares. I chose a Tunnel Hyren and she chose an Entomb. There were enough foils and rares for the stack to go around twice, and for my second pick I got a Shadow Cloak(there were 2 in the stack). In summary, I love Magi-Nation and the people in this area make it very fun to play. Most people from other states complain about baiting and unsportsmanlike conduct, but I have no complaints about a single player in our Arundel Mills tournaments. For a five dollar investment, just for playing you get a random pack of cards(minus the rare) and a choice or two from a stack of Rares/foils according to how well you did and how many foils were in the packs opened for prizes. The top 2 get signed art, Animite, and a Limited Foil(of course the prizes very from tournament to tournament). Two weeks ago the prize was an uncut sheet from the Base set, but I was on a Spring Break vacation to Niagara Falls Canada so I missed the chance to win it :(<br>
