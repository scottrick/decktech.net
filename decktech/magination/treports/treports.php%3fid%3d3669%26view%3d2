Format: Constructed<br>
Rounds: 3<br>
<br>
A week before this Tournament began(I found it on internet), I went to preregister and ask how many people would be showing up to play.  The Tournament Director said, &quot;Including you, Four.&quot;  That surprised the heck out of me, so that Saturday at Arundel Mill WotC, I informed the other players of a Friday SL in case they wanted to fit in 2 for the week.  Most said they wouldn&#39;t be able to make it...<br>
<br>
Friday May 3rd.  I show up and about 10 minutes later to my surprise, Chris Slye and Charles Gatz show up.  Two of the best players from Arundel Mills(a lot of the best players go to AM WotC, so if I do not mention you, I apologize!).  And right before the SL began, Emily and Kristen Aiken showed up too!  This mother daughter combo tears up the Magi Nation scene, but unfortunately they randomly end up playing each other on their way to the top tiers of each tournament.  So while there were only 8 people at this SL, 5 of them(if you are willing to include me) consistently place in the top 4 of the 20+ people Tournaments.  Before this thing started that revelation hit me, and I realized that each game today would be exactly like playing in the finals of a regular 20+ person Tournament, ouch :(  The only other HEAVY hitter from AM that I at least need to point out who did not come to the Dundalk SL was Craig Bidinger(DarkChild, since he beat me at the last tournament I went to).<br>
<br>
With everyone registered, the Rayje&#39;s Shields were handed out and the pairings announced.  I was not sure whether I wanted to use my Arderial Xyx/Vellup deck or my Naroom &quot;Best of the Best&quot; deck, but in the last few seconds I decided to stay true to Naroom.  My Magi and order:Trynn, Pruitt, Ohk.  As this SL took place a while ago now, I apologize in advance for anything that is incorrect or forgotten.<br>
<br>
Round 1: Underneath(Radget, Gyrg, Fossik, Ringsmith) played by Chris Slye<br>
With the announcement, Chris looked a little upset as we generally play each other later on in the finals.  Another part of the reason is that while he beats me consistently in casual play, I tend to always sneak in the victories at the tournaments.  This game started out with me drawing my Rayje&#39;s Belts pretty early.  I hate that I have them in here, but they tend to be the best defense against joust about anything and everything.  My future versions will include Inhibitor Bands instead as I really dislike the card.  I would prefer that the winner won because he played better and not necessarily because he happened to have better cards than anyone else.  Now unfortunately I couldn&#39;t belt Radget&#39;s Refresh without also hurting Tryn or Pruitt.  Therefore I belted shield until Radget was defeated.  Before she was defeated I lost a Eebit and the Belt to a Beam Of Light.  I knew that Gyrg starts with a Cave Rudwot and a Resonate, so I didn&#39;t play the other Belt until I was sure I needed it.  The thing I love when I play this deck against underneath is that I am usually safe from other Ormagons.  My Braggles are always morphed, and the Granas are Underneath.  I just have to play it a little safe with everything else.  The thing I hate about playing against Underneath is that my Ormagons are not useless.  Every time I draw one I ditch it with the Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel.  I got one rather early, along with the Ormagons, so I cycle them out the turn after I got them.  In the end he brought out Fossik, and some Thunderquakes, but he didn&#39;t have a solid way to stop my burrowed Granas.  A few notes about his deck.  He does not have any burrow.  His deck is an offensive Underneath deck, and those people whining about facing Akido(I agree that MRP&#39;s are in order, I am just using Hyperbole) needs to witness Chris abuse Strag&#39;s Claws.  Another mistake you can make when playing Chris is leaving your creatures at four or less energy.  Crushing Fungus has got to be the second best Crushing Spell and he uses it with reckless abandon.  He always tries to shockwave and undertow my big Braggles and Granas, but as he even said as he played them, &quot;Just discard your four energy and your Umm..Nooo&quot; because he knew I had one in hand.  The Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel works wonders when metagaming and dropping the fat to get to exactly what you need whether it be a Warrior&#39;s Boots, Umm...Nooo, Ormagon, or Rayje&#39;s Belt.<br>
<br>
Round 2: Core(The Dark Twins, Morag) played by Kristen Aiken<br>
I tend to build my decks to beat Kristen, so these game are always fun.  When we play enough for her to know what I have, she tends to win, but whenever I build and play a new deck, the advantage of surprise is usually enough to put me over the top for our first few encounters.  She started with the Twins and got two Entombs and a Wudge.  She then Entombed Shockwave and Thunderquake while I looked at her like she was crazy.  Never do that unless you know what you are facing, or you have those cards yourself.  As this was a newer deck of hers, I figured she had more copies of those spells since she should know better, but she did not lead me on either way until I got hit with both the TQ and Shockwave in back to back turns.  Of course I tried to get her to Entomb Cleansing right off the bat, but she knew that I think it is a stupid card and that I would never play with it(at least not in my Naroom decks).  The Twins managed to take out Tryn without much hassle as they start with everything a Magi could want, but Pruitt turned the Tides to my favor.  She knocked out the Twins with an incoming Ormagon, and continued the assault with Granas.  When Morag came in he stole my Energy Band, but I already gave the Ormagon enough Energy to explode again, so this match was over pretty quickly by comparison to our normal Duels.<br>
<br>
Round 3: Naroom(Sperri, Yaki, Pruitt)played by Emily Aiken<br>
While she has an awesome deck, my Naroom doesn&#39;t really fear other Naroom.  I know that she loves to splash in Shockwaves, and in the case of an Arderial match I pack 3 Umm...Nooos to be safe.  The game went back and forth with her knocking out Tryn and then Pruitt taking out Sperri and her Yaki.  I was surprised that she didn&#39;t have any Yaki&#39;s Gauntlets when she got her starting cards, but she said she left them in her other deck.  She made excellent use of her Alpine Xamf&#39;s and Flying Hinkos, but being able to attack more than once doesn&#39;t do much good when you have a wall of Braggle&#39;s, Granas, and Flutter Yups in front of you.  After she brought in Pruitt, I have an Ormagon, Tap Roots, and Warrior&#39;s boots in my hand and Ohk yet to enter play for good measure, but my Granas brigade held up and finally her Pruitt fell.<br>
<br>
Emily beat Charles and I beat Chris, so in the end when C&C were tied for 3rd and 4th, they just played another round between themselves to settle which region would get the higher ranking in the SL since the prizes for 3rd and 4th were the same.  In a close game where both players were down to their Last Magi, with Charles&#39; Nimbulo unable to stop Fossik&#39;s paramlag attack, Arderial had to settle for fourth.<br>
<br>
Charles(Authentic Wargammer) wrote a report to DeckTech, but it got lost in the vast space which is the internet, but let us hope that it will one day resurface so that we may see how the other games turned out.<br>
<br>
My biggest complaint of the day was that I switched the Pylofufs in my deck for Granas and then forgot to take out my Ghost Bwisps.  I made a mental note and set about preparing for the Arundel Mills SL the next day.  I have yet to win 2 SL&#39;s in one weekend...would this be my first?<br>
<br>
Props: Everyone, I love playing with these guys because they are powerful opponents and fun people!<br>
<br>
Slops: I would have liked to have more than 3 rounds, but as there were only 8 people, there really was no reason to.<br>
