Format: Constructed<br>
Rounds: Four<br>
Attendance:  About 12 - 14<br>
<br>
It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve written a tournament report.  This is due to the not-so-good standing in the last several tournaments that I&#39;ve played.  I&#39;m writing this however, because losing tournament reports can teach people things as well as winning tournament reports.  So sit back, take a deep breath and get ready for the ride...<br>
<br>
Round 1 vs. Austin Gardner (Lady of the Sky/Elios/Sorreah)<br>
<br>
In building and tweaking my deck, I&#39;ve recently thought about the possibility of having to face another Arderial deck.  In preparing for that event, I considered using Alaban Gloves with Grand Epiks or Grand Epiks with Flood of Energy.<br>
I looked at cards such as Brannix too.  But in the end, especially after last tournament, I decided that the better Arderial deck would be the one that was better constructed with a better player.<br>
<br>
My opponent loses the roll off and I decide to energize first (go figure).  He reveals Lady of the Sky and this little padawan Arderial suprised me with his next plays.  He gets a Xyx Minor, uses a Shooting Star, then pumps itself up with Gathering Clouds, then proceeds to Sorreah&#39;s Dream the thing to make it bigger.  As if Lady of the Sky doesn&#39;t already have enough starting energy!  Well, with Xyx&#39;s on both sides of the board, neither of our Elder Xyx&#39;s could touch each other, so it came down to Spells and attacks.<br>
<br>
As I Storm Clouded, Thunderquaked, and Cataclysmed my opponent, The Lady of the Sky, Elios, then Sorreah fell pretty quick.  I felt especially bad for still having Sorreah in play when Lady of the Sky was defeated....and when Elios was defeated and he had to discard down to five cards.<br>
<br>
Standing 1-0-0<br>
<br>
Round 2 vs. Harry Isaksson(Ogar/All High King Korg/Morag)<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve never played Harry before and when I saw that he was playing Core, I wasn&#39;t worried....at all!  Why?  Because as I&#39;ve stated in other tournament reports, my deck cut its teeth playing against Core so it is the region that I feart the least.  Harry wins the roll off and elects to go first.  ???? I&#39;m puzzled, but it was his call.<br>
<br>
He drops two creatures down and rolls because of Ogar&#39;s effect.  He cheers as he rolls less than 4 on both rolls.  The total  on both of his creatures is 11E so on my turn I flip Sorreah and pull Cataclysm, Storm Cloud and Sorreah&#39;s Dream.  My opponent says something interesting at this point.  He explains to me that I don&#39;t have to show him the spells that I draw because Sorreah&#39;s text says &quot;any two Spells&quot;.  The tournament director (TD) agreed with him.  I still have my doubts about that and I even said,&quot;What if I draw creatures or relics instead?; How would my opponent know?&quot;  The TD responded by stating that as my opponent, he had the perogative to ask a judge to see my pulls if he suspected me of doing just that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on with the report.  After the Cataclysm, I knew he still had that Black Agovo in his hand so I peruse my cards deciding what, if anything else should I play, should he use the Black Agovo&#39;s Disrupt.  I decide to play a creature ( I don&#39;t remember which) and draw my two.  He did play the Black Agovo, but didn&#39;t use it&#39;s Disrupt.  I can only surmise that he needed it more for a wall than to discard the cards in my hand.<br>
<br>
Ogar doesn&#39;t last very long and to my suprise, All High King Korg is revealed and guess what?  I&#39;ve still got Sorreah in play.  I&#39;m not too nervous because I&#39;ve got experience playing against Korg and Zet with this deck so even though Korg gets that whopping 26 starting energy, I think I can handle him.  The only time that Harry took advantage of his Suppressed King Korg was to play a Shadow Bones. I beat King Korg up pretty bad, slowly wittling his energy down with Storm Clouds, Alaban&#39;s and such.   As Harry&#39;s Magnificent, Illustrious, Dwindling Emporer of Great and Mighty Bograth was finding himself with less and less energy to work with, his last acts were to place Secrets of the Book down and draw a bunch of cards.<br>
<br>
As All High King Korg, Maginificent, Illustrious, Defeated Emporer of Great and Might Bograth went down, out came Morag.  With a few relics in my hand, I began to see how Morag can be annoying.  After his initial turn, it was during my turn that I made a very, very crucial error:  Using my Vellup chain, I brought out a Thunder Hyren.  He had four creatures staring at me so I responded with the Thunder Hyren because that is my deck&#39;s answer to creature swarms.   Well, I had a Yarothis in my deck.  It&#39;s in there for Core.  I should have drawn it.  I had the energy, but I wasn&#39;t thinking too clearly.  My instincts told me to pull the Thunder Hyren. <br>
<br>
Well, as fate would have it, after popping Shockstorm off, on his turn, he Turns it.  Ouch!  I am unable to recover.  Down to my last Magi (Morag defeated Ora rather quickly with a Core Grag earlier in the game). Elios, I spend many an eventless minutes trying to decide what to make his energize rate.  Elios replaced Nimbulo two tournaments ago, because I lost too many games needing that &quot;just one more energy&quot;.  After much contemplating and a plea by Harry to &quot;please don&#39;t stall this game out&quot;, I decide to energize for 8 stating that I was a gambling man and for &quot;all the money in the pot&quot; we&#39;ll just see what would happen.   I throw down a Xyx Elder and a Xyx Minor.  I roll the die....... and get a 2!!!  It did some damage, but only enough to stall him.  He admits that he is 1E short of winning and unable to discard it,  draws two and the ball is back in my court.<br>

Looking at my hand and seeing the energy on Harry&#39;s side of the board, I can see I&#39;m fighting an uphill duel.  That critical error really hurt me earlier. I was staring at a Xyx, Cloud Storm, Alaban Gloves and some other non-game winning stuff in my hand  and Harry with  control of my Alaban at full energy and the two beat up creatures from my Xyx Elder..  What to do? What to do?!!<br>
<br>
Well, there was nothing I could do.  I could Undream the Alaban at which time would put 6E back on his Magi (remember this is Morag we&#39;re talking about here).<br>
After many, many moments of thinking, I finally came to the conclusion that there was no way out.  I dropped the Gloves, Undreamed the Alaban back into my hand, leaving me with enough energy to bring out the Xyx which did nothing even while Shocking Morag for four......game over..<br>
<br>
Standing 1-0-1<br>
<br>
Round 3 vs. Emily Aiken (Evil Evu/Yaki/Tryn)<br>
<br>
Emily handed me my butt at the Storyline tourney at the beginning of last month.  I had heard that she was a good player and she definitely proved it to me then.  Now , it was a chance to redeem my deck (which was the same, yet slightly modified of what she had faced back then).<br>
<br>
She starts off with both of Evil Evu&#39;s creatures and so the total energy she lays down on the board is 11E.  I was fortunate enough to draw a Vellup in my openning hand.  I had already pulled Cataclysm, but something made me stop and think.  <br>
<br>
I proceeded to drop the Vellup, grabbed an Elder Vellup, then grabbed my Yarothis. Dropping that, I used Sorreah&#39;s Dream to Scouring Gale one creature, then had the Yarothis do it again on the other.  In essence, I just paid 8E to discard 11E rather than 10E (Cataclysm) for 11E.<br>
 <br>
Evil Evu didn&#39;t last long after that. When Yaki came out, it was a whole &#39;nuther story. At one time, Emily was trading her Forest Hyren&#39;s power with a Weebo and back again!  Her creatures were getting big fast!!  I finally Cataclysmed both.<br>
   The game went downhill for Emily after that.  What happened was that I was able to get two Xyx Minors out WITH an Alaban Gloves in play.  I kept cycling the Xyx Minors, Undreaming one, only to play it again and repeat the next turn.  I&#39;ve never had Ora with more energy than she knew what to do with!  I tell you what though, it felt great to see such card synergy when I was able to pull that combo off. If I could only get my deck to do that all the time......<br>
<br>
Standing 2-0-1<br>
<br>
Last round vs. Kristen Aiken (Dark Twins/Morag)<br>
<br>
You&#39;re probably thinking the same thing I was at the time.  &quot;How appropriate.  I defeat the daughter, only to have to face her mother&quot;.  Well, again, I know Kristen is playing Core and it&#39;s the same Core deck that I had to face while in the Storyline Tournament.  So in a sense, this was a re-match for us, with Kristen wanting revenge!  You see, Kristen made a critical error during the Storyline Tournament, where she paid 8E on two Crushing Darkness&#39; to snag 4E worth of my creatures.  She was thinking &quot;Turn&quot; , but instead paid for the Crushing Darkness&#39;.   That was the first time that I had played against her, too.<br>
<br>
So here we go, Kristen lays down the most attrocious opening play I have ever encountered.  Of course, Kristen knows what I am playing so 3/4ths of my decks strength (one of which is surprise) was nullified.  She Entombs Shockwave and Cataclysm (thanks to Emily shouting in the tournament,&quot;He Cataclysmed me!&quot;)<br>
No problem, she then plays Shadow Cloak (ouch!) and plays an 11E creature.<br>
<br>
I reveal Sorreah (nothing to Suppress!) and fetch Crushing Winds, Storm Cloud, and Sorreah&#39;s dream.  My two creatures that I draw from my deck are Xyx Minor and Xyx Minor!  What an absolutely lucky draw!!!   I can&#39;t do anything to her creature so I bring in the Xyx Minor&#39;s and begin ping-ponging them with the help of Sorreah&#39;s Dream.  <br>
<br>
This was effective in keeping her huge minion at bay until I could deal with it my next turn.  We had some great plays.  It took me awhile to hammer away at the Dark Twins, but they fell, as well as my Sorreah.  Ora fell, unfortunately, too quickly vs. Morag and an untimely Core Grag.  I was hoping to get the combo that I was using against Emily.  During the final plays of the match, I was able to draw a Mantel of Shadows AND my Yarothis.  <br>
<br>
Neither of which I played.  One, because Morag would steal the Mantel, two, Kristen got a peak at my hand with her Secrets of the Book, and finally three,<br>
Even with mighty Elios, I didn&#39;t have the energy to pull the Yarothis and play something in my hand to make a difference.  <br>
<br>
In the end, while staring down fresh new creatures plotted down by Morag, I plopped two Xyx Elders into play.  I was hoping that I wouldn&#39;t have to use both of their Shockstorms.  I rolled one: 2!  I thought okay, bad roll.  The next HAS to be at least 3 or higher.  I rolled the second one..............  1!!!  I had a few spectators behind me and the in unison, the dull,&quot;Oooooooh&quot;, seeped into my ears as I realized that the game reached a critical turning point.  I spent 12E to do 9E.  <br>
<br>
Kristen&#39;s next move was to win the game with a Core Grag (I&#39;m really starting to hate those things).  <br>
<br>
Standing 2-0-2<br>
<br>
Again, I leave a tournament at 2-0-2!  But this time, I lost to two very, very good players.  Which goes to show that no deck can win all of the time.  Sometimes the opponent just has the superior skill AND the superior deck.  I can&#39;t complain.  In both losses I got both players down to their last Magi and trickling amounts of energy.  It was any man&#39;s (or woman&#39;s) game during the final turns.  I can&#39;t think of a better way to lose.  I hope you got something out of this tournament report.  <br>
<br>
Props<br>
<br>
-  To Emily for still sticking to Naroom (albeit a slightly tainted one) her beloved region. (Her reasoning was that Elios and Ora succeeded in liberating Evil Evu, so in essence, her deck was till Naroom).<br>
<br>
-  Shawn for sacrificing his desire to play in tournaments to run the tournaments.<br>
<br>
-  Kristen and Harry for being such good winners.<br>
<br>
- Chris for letting me snap his mug for the Maryland DeckTech group site. (Yes, he won the tournament 4-0-0)<br>
<br>
- Brad for the Bubble Xyxes (No, I&#39;m NOT constructing Aikido!) <br>
<br>
Slops<br>
<br>
-  My Xyx Elders for letting me down. : P<br>
<br>
-  Core Grags how I have come to loathe ye. : P<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy Dueling!<br>
