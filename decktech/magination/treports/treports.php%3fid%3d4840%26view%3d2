2-7-2004<br />
<br />
Its nice to have a Saturday off from work. The last one I spent on a date. However, with no such plans for the day, I drove over to Century Magic. I made sure to bring my own decks with me. There actually was a tournament on Wednesday that I surprisingly made it to, without my decks though. I had grabbed the wrong box of cards when I left on my afternoon date that day.<br />
<br />
Well, I racked up another loss to my records using a borrowed deck. Afterwards, we determined that I may have chosen poorly on which deck to borrow (both Bates and Raven had offered me a chance to choose from their multiple decks). However, I was surprised to find that Adam Bates only has one Muck Vinoc in his Bograth deck. He prefers the spell Darkness. I ended up wishing he had more of the creature instead of the spell, it wouldve made things much easier against Kybars Teeth. Sure, the spell seems to fit the task, but most of the time I only needed a Giant Baldar or Greater Gargagnor to take the fall. <br />
<br />
Chase Williams definitely is a good, new player of the teeth, so I really dont begrudge the loss to him. He deserved that win. That doesnt mean I was going to let things settle there. I cant let the new crop of players get too y. Now, can I? With a Saturday off, and with the tournament on Wednesday still fresh on my mind, I wasnt going to miss this chance.<br />
<br />
It was actually snowing quite nicely as I drove. This made me wonder how the turnout would be, but they still had eight players. Now, I still need to learn some names of a few players, but I did take notes on my three games. I even made it a point to try calling them by their names afterwards. The more I practice, the better the chances Ill remember their names later. Not a guarantee, of course, but I can use the better odds. My memory for names and faces is less than desirable.<br />
<br />
Since I was early, I actually had the chance to teach another youth how to play Magi-Nation. He was looking at Arderial, so when someone offered to let him borrow one of their decks, I suggested that he pick their xyx deck. I then chose my adept deck, and we went through a full game pitting Arderial against Arderial. With two different decks, I hoped he would get a better feel for the region. Also, I played with my hand revealed during that game. First, so he could see what I was doing. Second, so he could see what I did and did not use. It was a bit of a challenge to play my deck in a manner to prevent the xyx deck, or my deck, from exploding into something out of control. We were running out of time at the end, so I did pull the win for the learner game. However, I was very pleased that I had managed to get each of us to our last magi and a very tight game at the end.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that, the store started collecting the entry fees and assigned the first round pairings. One of the players was borrowing my Weave deck for the tournament. Knowing that my Underneath deck has several Kybars Teeth/Underneath creatures to deal with Wessig and has been shown through another game to be very strong against my aggro-Weave, I used my deck Under It All, as posted on DeckTech.<br />
<br />
<br />
First Round<br />
<br />
Powell was my first opponent. He used a dResh deck. The popular dResh deck around here runs a Nahara-Nashiq combo that be very nasty. However, this was not Powells deck, so it was somewhat interesting to observe. He started off with Nahara, though. So, my first guess on his deck ended up being wrong. This became readily apparent as he threw down Venger among his creatures as well as Sandstorm Xyx. Neither of these presented a real problem for my deck. I crushed Venger at least twice during the game, and I think I crushed at least three times during the whole game. It was actually a fast game. Between my Crushing Fungus preventing him from energizing multiple times, my burrowed creatures that attacked, and the general mix of spells and powers I tossed down (mostly spells with the Sandstorm Xyx repeatedly showing up), Myka tore through his magi in a relatively short number of turns. Nahara was followed by Ythra, who didnt have any Dessicates when it wouldve been nice to cut through my burrow. The last magi was Ahron. I used Strags Ring to pin down his illusionary creature for a couple turns while I went after the non-illusionary creatures with a vengeance. On the last turn, I spent the last of my energy to play out a game ending combo. I played the Ormalet and used its power to wipe out all his small stuff. Attekias Gift returned the Ormalet and his last non-illusionary creature to his hand. To finish off his magi, I used Impact with my only other creature in play.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
I really do like the ability to chose almost any creature for Strags Ring to burrow with purity. This, in fact, is why my Weave deck is weak against my Underneath deck.<br />
Neg.<br />
While it nice to see a non-Nahara-Nashiq deck, his deck still needs help. We actually played a second game with our spare time against one of my weaker decks, Naroom No More. Again, my first magi went all the way.<br />
<br />
Second Round.<br />
<br />
For the second round, I was pitted against Bond Williams. He was playing with one of his more recent, fun creations. Its a Naroom deck that starts with Poad. Since Ive done that before myself, I knew who his first magi was just by the starting cards. Poad made a good start. However, Myka threw down a full burrow barrage very early on. This quickly expanded to five of my relics (the sixth is a second copy of Digging Goggles) being in play. By the time Myka punched through Poads energy tricks and swarm of creatures, she had four attacking, burrowed creatures in play. Yaki tossed down well as the second magi, but Myka had too strong of position going into the conflict. While she couldnt get Yaki in a single pass, she did manage to do massive damage and Yaki could not recover. By the time Tryn hit the field on the end, it wasnt getting any better. Myka continued the onslaught. Of interest in this game was that I was using Strags Ring to burrow my own creatures, most frequently an Akkar. This really helped my deck against the Naroom swarm tactics.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
The simplicity of burrowing Urigant and Kier. This allowed me to achieve a quick and easy burrow. Sure, the Urigant digs up other burrowed creatures, but it works great against spells and powers.<br />
Neg.<br />
Apparently Bond had something that might help against burrow. I never found out what it might be because it never showed up during the game. Though, a Giant Carillion or two wouldve been a great asset during that game. I definitely saw the Weebos to go with it.<br />
<br />
Third Round<br />
<br />
I got my rematch against Chase Williams for the third round. He was using the same Kybars Teeth deck I lost to on Wednesday. While I wouldve loved to try my own Bograth deck against it as a test of my own deck, I had chosen Underneath today. When I made my choice, this is one of the decks I had in mind. See, what had really made things nasty for the Bograth deck I borrowed on Wednesday was Wessig recurred with Ritual Spear. No, he didnt use Ritual Spear with Wessig. He used it to get back Wessig, who was his starting magi. While I had taken on Wessig with Bograth by playing somewhat conservatively so I didnt lose much in resources, the second time around I had too much on the field and not enough on the magi. Since my Underneath deck uses Urigant, Akkar, and Kier, I figured it could survive the Wessig trick quite easily. However, it wasnt the Wessig trick that impressed me the most. It was his game play. Hes showing quite some skill for someone whos only played Magi-Nation for a month and a half. This time, though, I never did see the Ritual Spear. He didnt draw it to get Wessig back. However, he did play a real good game. Wessig took a little time to get through, as well as The Prankster, his second magi. The Baldars could frequently hit my Pylofuf or Granas without losing energy. This was combined with Shard of the Great Fossil and several invulnerable creatures, though mostly he used it with Greater Gargagnor. I used Resonate a couple times on that relic, once after he used the Greater Gargagnor to fetch it from the discard pile. I did make a mistake. For a moment, I forgot that Great Gargagnor could not be specifically discarded by spells. So, I wasted three energy for Bottomless Pit. In the end, it came down to Emaal (my second magi) versus Kazm. I did occasionally give Kazm some free energy, but I also had a habit of using Strags Ring and Gorgles Curse against his various creatures, though mostly the Cliff Hyren for Gorgles Curse. This is one game the Urigant served me better than it did my opponent. And, yes, he did toss one out. I hit it with my Pylofuf, even though my Pylofuf took a nasty number with that, and then destroyed it. So, in the end, his was so short-lived, that it hardly mattered. On the other hand, my burrowed Urigant was quite useful against his burrowed Greater Gargagnor. I am not sure he appreciated me burrowing his creatures, either.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Chase put in the best fight. He used Rockslide several times at critical moments, as well as using Warriors Boots to push hard with his fresh magi.<br />
Neg.<br />
For a moment, Chase forgot that Greater Gargagnor can only use its power to Kybars Teeth cards. I sort of caught him using it to get a Universal card. He then reread the power and put the Relic Stalker back and got something else, something Kybars Teeth. Too bad. He really couldve used that Relic Stalker for Strags Ring or Digging Goggles.<br />
<br />
Like the last couple times Ive played in a tournament at Century Magic, they placed a bunch of cards upside down and let us choose a number according to how we did or some other such. This time I pulled all foils. What I really wanted was animite, though. After the tournament, I did get the chance to get some animite, even if I had to trade some rare cards for it. Soon, I need to figure out how much I actually have and prepare an order for a bunch of limited cards I want.<br />
<br />
After the tournament, I gave away more of my extra common and uncommon cards as well as played a few more games. Bond looked at making decks for several other regions, and I demonstrated to Chase a few of my other decks, including Core and dResh. The dResh deck was pitted against his Kybars Teeth deck and took all three magi using only Nahara. And, oh yes, my dResh deck is one of those builds that uses the Nahara-Nashiq combo. I had revamped it back from a Kybars Teeth and dResh mix (posted on DeckTech) back to a dResh deck. We also gave my latest Kybars Teeth deck a test spin against his Arderial deck. The game was so terrible that I dont think I can call it a test. Kazm, the first magi, went all the way, even against Sorreah despite my not having a Climbing Staff the whole time Sorreah was in play.<br />
