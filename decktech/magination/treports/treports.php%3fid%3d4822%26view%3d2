1-14-2004<br />
<br />
I spent most of the day reading a book at home. It was my day off from work, and I was enjoying a nice, relaxing day. Knowing that they have Magi-Nation League on Wednesday nights, I figured that I would get out and doing something for the evening. Ive already completed the Naroom Season myself, when it first came out, but I thought I could offer some support and games for some of the players that picked up the game in the past month or so.<br />
<br />
Well, after I got to Century Magic, they started looking for players to play in a tournament. This called for a change of plans. I was fine with tossing a few games for just league, but not so for a tournament. Make mistakes. Help new players. Thats one thing. Throw a tournament game? I dont recall ever doing that. I used to play my experimental decks in tournaments, but I havent done that for a while. Besides, I didnt really have any of those with me.<br />
<br />
Many of my decks are tournament worthy, and a few are not. In fact, at least one of my decks Ive been leaving in just miserable shape because it makes it fairly easy for most the locals to beat me. With the change in plans though, I swapped up to my aggro-Weave deck. Its not necessarily my best deck, but its no slouch either. Its one of my tournament quality decks.<br />
<br />
The other participants were Chase and Bond Williams, brothers, and Stephen Reed for a total of four. We played a round robin tournament with three rounds, so we got the opportunity to play each other.<br />
<br />
Now, this is actually my second tournament for 2004, although I failed to take notes during my first one for the year. What I can tell you about that one is that I got to meet several new players of Magi-Nation. My opponents that tournament were a young girl, her brother, and another boy. Unfortunately, other than looking it up on the website, I fell short of my goal to remember names and the games. Since I beat Bond miserably in a casual game before the tournament, a bunch of the players were afraid when I was called as their opponent. The girl and her brother were already showing some skill at the game and I was most pleased playing against them, even if I did crush them.<br />
<br />
Well, back to the tournament I participated in this Wednesday....<br />
<br />
First Round<br />
Bond Williams was my first opponent. Among the group of new players at Century Magic, he is feared by many of them. He played a Core deck starting with Warrada for this tournament. He pulled both her creatures and her ring. Now, he did have me go first despite winning the dice roll. This was to my advantage. The sooner I can start attacking, the better it usually goes for my deck. Bond didnt make things easy for Taisa. He used Shadow Bones combined with Terrorize to take on my forces. However, I had pulled my only Sawgrass early in the game. A few turns later though, Taisa had finished her work and it was time for Kesia, although he had also lost Warrada. Kesia flipped and faced off against Lanyx. Something really nasty to do, I tossed down two Drowl with her followed by the Grass Etiki and Aritex I had just managed to draw. With her nineteenth point of energy being spent in the first spells and relics step for a Brushfire, Kesia made a real strong start against a slightly beat up Lanyx. A few turns later, I was able to repeat the Aritex combo. Kesia was really into the swing of things and tore into Lanyx and Evil Evu on the end. While Evil Evu did manage to place out several creatures. But, it was not enough, despite using Dream Rift to draw some extra cards to get some more of those creatures to play.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Bond showed some great stuff with Shadow Bones and Terrorize. It was a very good move, and wouldve made things difficult if it werent for the Sawgrass in hand.<br />
Neg.<br />
Dream Rift and Evil Evu on the end. Warrada does make for a powerful starting magi, but Evil Evu is more of a setup magi than he is a finishing one. That, and I think Dream Rift can leave a magi too spent to make a strong stand. Evil Evu didnt stand much of a chance with only fifteen energy left to actually play those creatures with.<br />
<br />
Second Round.<br />
Chase was my second opponent and an even newer player than Bond. He was using his brothers Arderial deck. Wary of the ever popular Cataclysm, I played it safe whenever he had a fresh magi appear. Stradus was his first magi and he poured quite a bit into his opening turn. However, once again, I had gone first. This time, it wasnt Terrorize that could cause problems for me, but Arderials old friend, the Flutter Yup. Beefed up some, it could cause problems for many of my creatures. The first Flutter Yup he played met its fate to that same Sawgrass I had used in my last game. Taisa made short work of Stradus and moved into Shimmer before Chase could get any real good selection of cards for her. Shimmer didnt last long, and Sorreah made his appearance on the end. Sorreah didnt play out much, but after he played out a creature, Taisa tossed down a vast swarm. However, Taisa still had a bunch of energy to spare when Sorreah used Cataclym. Taisa recovered quickly and even took out Sorreah despite the restriction on using a magis powers and/or effects. In this game, it was Taisa that made use of the Aritex combo and went all the way.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Chase did wait to use Cataclysm. Unfortunately, it was too late to stop the aggro-Weave. It turns out that he had it in hand for some time, but my somewhat conservative play with Taisa didnt present any good opportunities for him to do massive damage until near the very end. I think this speaks well of him and I expect to see some more interesting games in the future.<br />
Neg.<br />
I would like to say Cataclysm again, but it was the best alternative he had at that moment. Taisa really did control a lot of energy in a large number creatures. However, Cataclysm did cost him his creature as well and left his magi with very little energy left over.<br />
<br />
Third Round.<br />
I could say that Stephen stepped up to the plate as my third opponent, but I chose to move tables to where he was. We actually rolled the dice twice. We both rolled ones on the first toss. I managed to win the roll, and chose to go first. I got a good starting hand. However, in this game, the Tropical Jumbor was going to give me a great assist in matching or beating the energy tricks of Naroom. Poad started off by dropping down two Vortex of Knowledge. This did far more than just grease the wheels for his deck. The aggro-Weave went from standard to overdrive. It still took a little to build up steam, but when Poad went down, Tryn really did need the Hood of Hiding. In many ways, this was a first. Ive never considered the Hood of Hiding a good relic. And, it still didnt save Tryn. All it did was buy her another turn. Tryn was followed by Pruitt. By this time, Taisa not only had a vast and oppressive swarm out, but the little combo with Weave Hyren and Three Leaf Clover had been added to the mix. However, it was the two Seaweed Lascinth in play that really spelled doom for the Naroom deck. Between simply using reflexes, weaving to them and Weave Seed, they were eating the Naroom forces alive. Combined with an Uwamar with plenty of energy to weave to my other creatures, and the deck was running very smoothly.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
The Weave deck was in top form. No one ever saw Gia as my third magi this day.<br />
Neg.<br />
Multiple Vortex of Knowledge and a fifty card deck. The Vortex of Knowledge can grease the wheels on a Naroom deck, but I rarely, if ever, recommend it more than once. Once is fine and does help. More than that, and you are usually giving the upper hand to your opponent. Also, after the game, I found out that his deck was fifty cards.<br />
<br />
After the tournament, I really encouraged Stephen to trim some fat out of the deck, of course that included reducing Vortex of Knowledge to one copy and removing both copies of Hood of Hiding. I told him that it was better to place a creature with the four energy so his opponent has to deal with the critter and likely take some damage as well. Also, by trimming to forty, we could keep basically the same deck hes got but get it up to a better working standard. I think our final cut was around forty-two cards. I think hell do a bit better next time.<br />
<br />
For prize support, Century Magic placed out nine cards face down on a mat. For first place, I was allowed to pick three. I managed to pull 25 animite, Ulligs Ring, and Grej. Grej will go in my trade binder, but I believe that is my first copy of the ring.<br />
<br />
I find this new crop of players refreshing, some great people and a fresh group excited about the game. I expect some good things of some of them. With time and practice, Luke Jensen might have some more competition. Who knows, a few might even get to where they compete with Matt Jensen (I believe hes tied for ninth in Utah) too. If so, then I will find this new group very interesting.<br />
