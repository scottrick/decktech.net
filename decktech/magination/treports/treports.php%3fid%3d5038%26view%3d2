Hey, with us running 3 a week, you&#39;d think that attendance would eventually stabilize, but instead Magi-Nation is growing ever larger! Today&#39;s tournament featured 7 people, so we ran it in a Swiss format.<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s the tournament link to the Magi-Nation site:<br />
http://www.magi-nation.com/Tournaments/tournaments_detail.asp?tournament_id=405000068<br />
<br />
You can find our store&#39;s site here for discussion:<br />

<br />
Again, as an active participant in this tournament, I&#39;ll only briefly go over the other matches as I didn&#39;t see them all happen; and it&#39;s distracting to others to always hover around them. I chose to play my Kybar&#39;s Teeth region deck again.<br />
<br />
A little bit of background; on Thursday I had lost two games to Lite Serene and Jeff Kuo using my Kybar&#39;s deck. With Lite (who was playing Cald) I lost because I wasn&#39;t patient enough and he rolled sixes in rows (3 to 4 at a time) with Thermal Blast and similar powers (Drakkar, Bombard, etc.), with Jeff I lost due to horrible rolling with Hogra Stones and because we didn&#39;t know that Moob was errated. I also had a horrible time with rolling with the Stones in general throughout the tournament... I didn&#39;t actually get around to writing a tournament report for this, so this is the summary of it, basically. Jeff ended up winning, a straight 5-0 shutout.<br />
The link to that tournament:<br />
http://www.magi-nation.com/Tournaments/tournaments_detail.asp?tournament_id=405000067<br />
<br />
Anyhow, demoralized from Thursday but determined to rework the deck and prove that I could beat Jeff once the errrata was applied and my deck was fixed up, I had changed some of the following:<br />
<br />
I had taken out Xamf, Gratch, Yebed, one Garganor and one Chogus. I had been running the three former, and two of both latter. But these were all combination cards and I found that unless I ran 3 of each; they never worked; and they weren&#39;t that good on their own. You needed to run Crag Quor, Yark, Slime Stone, Rokarum, and other such things to make them good; and that was a deck I was fooling around with building. Cragnoc, Sandstone Hyren, Rock Yajo (my second one came back), Sagawal, and Mosp went into the deck (the three latter I had taken out before; and the two former I got in trade on Friday). I was hoping this would make a difference in the games to follow.<br />
<br />
- Round 1 -<br />
vs. Ryan Borau (Weave):<br />
Just a quick background on Ryan. This Wednesday there were 8 people out for the Magi-Nation tournament, and Ryan somehow won the Swiss format tournament, surprising himself and the MND community in general with his Weave deck. Now this was his only deck and Ryan did admirably, beating Jeff Kuo, Les Sohier, and Cameron Young (Bograth, D&#39;Resh, and Bograth respectively). Ryan and I had played on Tuesday briefly, my Nar fun deck against his Weave, and I had locked him down and beat him to a pulp. However, he had beaten my Core deck and my Arderial/Orothe deck, and he said he&#39;d probably give my Kybar&#39;s Deck a run for its money. After all, in the other tournament that he and I participated in, he had come second; only getting beaten by myself. He was also the first person ever to see my third Magi, Ullig; most only saw Targ&#39;n. So, it was with some anticipation that we began the duel.<br />
Other duels that occurred during round included Adam Langford (Cald), a player that had been playing awhile and was just gaining confidence in himself, versus Travis Stanley, self-proclaimed &quot;lover of Naroom&quot; who really seemed to lose a lot of matches (he hasn&#39;t won a game yet; but hey, he&#39;s young, and he&#39;s got potential). Jeff Kuo, playing Bograth again, was playing Michael Charlesworth, playing Paradwyn.<br />
Ryan and I sat down and started playing. The first Magi on Ryan&#39;s side was Zaya with Zaya&#39;s Bow, versus Wessig. Wessig didn&#39;t last very long, and it wasn&#39;t long until Wessig was defeated with Zaya only having one creature out. Zaya tried to rally with a small summons, but Targ&#39;N just crushed her, forcing out Taisa out. Now, Taisa and Targ&#39;N&#39;s battle was long and arduous, but the Hogra Stones worked to my advantage twice, although it zapped me once (which is not a normal thing; since there aren&#39;t many relics in the deck). Taisa eventually brought out one creature via warrior&#39;s boots, used all the energy possible, then cast Weave Mind, then attacked, then Bo&#39;Hasa brought out a ream of new creatures, and Targ&#39;N was stumped. Now, this is the subject to some debate; but Ryan decided to keep Targ&#39;N alive. A good roll on Hogra Stones bumped up the energy, and I was able to do a few things; getting some more cards into my hand. When Ryan finally *did* decide to defeat Targ&#39;N, Gogor, the Celebrated Hero (or &quot;Mr.Diggalicous&quot; as we call him at the store) was ready to come out to PUMP YOU UP! Elder Yark came out with a Dream Channel, Akkar was out there with Sagawal. From there on, things were basically in my favor; as Gogor continued to pump things up while the Spade allowed me to draw cards anyway. Bo&#39;hasa eventually fell although ours was the longest match-up. Because of this, I didn&#39;t really get to see the other games, but this game was definitely fun.<br />
Adam had beaten Travis, and Jeff had beaten Michael. These results were probable and there were no &quot;unexpected upsets&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Round 2 -<br />
vs. Sarah Langford (Naroom):<br />
Sarah had gotten the bye in the first round, which meant she had gotten a &quot;free win&quot;. This meant she was 1-0, and the random pairing paired her against me. Sarah was immediately dejected and said she would lose...not a very good thing, so I tried to help her along the game, explaining cards to her. Her first Magi was Pruitt with Pruitt&#39;s Robe, and I tried to help her use it to the fullest extent. Eventually, this lead to Wessig&#39;s defeat; as I couldn&#39;t keep up with a creature who gained 8 energy a turn (5 energy from the robe and 3 energy from Pruitt&#39;s power). Unfortunately, Sarah tried to keep Pruitt alive and threw some cards away to try and stop Targ&#39;N&#39;s creatures, which bowled her over (an Agrilla, Cliff Hyren, Garganor, and a Sagawal). Pruitt died, and Yaki appeared. She summoned some creatures, but they all died in a heartbeat to the Kybar&#39;s creatures and a well placed Rock Slide on a twelve energy K&#39;Teeb. Amidst Sarah&#39;s begging to stay alive (yes, this isn&#39;t exaggerrated), I apologized and killed Yaki. Poad came out, but he also died in one turn, and our match was done.<br />
Elsewhere, Ryan watched on (he had the bye) as Jeff played Adam and Michael played Travis. The upset occurred when Adam beat Jeff; no-one had expected this. Adam had played the Slith Giant apparently; which really hurt Jeff&#39;s creatures, and the constant damage from things like Fire Chogo and Vorga&#39;s shatter; together with Magam (the alternate) were constant annoyances so that Jeff couldn&#39;t get the engine rolling.<br />
In the meantime, Michael beat Travis. Being brothers, they both that that was going to be the result anyway, so no big surprises there.<br />
<br />
- Round 3 -<br />
vs. Adam Langford (Cald):<br />
Some background on Adam. A while back, Adam and his girlfriend Sarah and decided to get into Magic. But upon seeing us all play Magi-Nation, he decided to try that too, and found that he liked that. He went for the region I was playing at the time; Orothe, and tried it out. But later on, he discovered he lost all the time, and switched to trying Cald. We tested it; I played both Orothe and Cald and he played both as well; against one another, and Cald won both times, so he stuck with Cald. Over time, his confidence has increased as well as his deck&#39;s cards and combinations, and on Wednesday he surprised us all by defeating Dave Boynton, who was quite a Magi-Nation veteran. Just in the last round, he had surprised us by beating Jeff Kuo, who had taken first on Thursday&#39;s tournament and second in Wednesday&#39;s tournament. But, the last week, Adam had not wanted to play me; conceding immediately to me, and this Thursday, he had conceded to me again; both times without playing me. This was because he &quot;feared&quot; me...wasn&#39;t really good, I kept telling him. You gotta try!<br />
Anyhow, Adam gave it a go and played me, but the dice didn&#39;t work for him. His Thermal blasts only hit for one to two damage each (as did his other &quot;Thermal Blast&quot;-esque powers/spells). He put up a good show, hurting and killing several of my creatures, but due to poor rolling and some demoralization, he just didn&#39;t come close to doing anything. Wessig wasn&#39;t even defeated, and so the game ended relatively quickly. I gave him some tips afterwards, and encouraged him to keep trying. But still, he resolves that next time he will concede again to me until he gets better. Oh well...<br />
In the meantime, Ryan played Michael, and Sarah played Jeff. Travis watched on the sidelines as Ryan absolutely dominated Michael (their match lasted the longest); with Ryan holding his hold deck in his hand while the only card recycling was Weave Seed. It was sick, sick, sick; together with all of his relics out Ryan just piledrove all of Michael&#39;s Magi.<br />
Sarah, in the meantime, was defeated by Jeff (the quickest match out of the round); even though Jeff tried to help, Sarah&#39;s deck definitely needs some more fine tuning before it&#39;s time will come. Plus, Sarah is still learning about her own cards, so maybe one day...<br />
<br />
- Round 4 -<br />
vs. Jeff Kuo (Bograth):<br />
Ah, this was the match I had been eagerly waiting for all day after Jeff told me he was going to be staying for the tournament. Anticipation was running high; Jeff had beaten me this Thursday (without using Moob&#39;s errata) and I wanted to prove I could beat his deck. I was still getting used to the pace of it; but was starting to understand it better now.<br />
The first round involved Baa and Wessig duking it out for a small period of time (Wessig put down a first turn Greater Garganor with Overgrowth), but Darkness finished Wessig with no creatures in play. Baa placed out more creatures and Targ&#39;N came out, quickly stomping Baa with an Agrilla and Garganor plus the Shard of the Great Fossil to lose no energy. Baa died, and Brog came out. Now, here was the part I remember clearly. I was debating whether or not to put Pebble Hinko or Urgiant down, and went for the Urgiant. However, this caused Jeff to be able to kill my Magi by killing my creatures with a quick Darkness and then I was dead. I shouldn&#39;t have, but it still worked out to my favor. Gogor, celebrated Hero came out again, and I brought out a Cliff Hyren with a Sagawal and a Pebble Hinko. Soon after followed a Thoughtful Baldar and a Dream Channel. Jeff quickly started going downhill after I had a 9 energize; and Brog was beginning to lose; as Jeff&#39;s deck recycled and he couldn&#39;t get his either of his two Darkness cards back. In the meantime, the Baldar chose Akkar (Jeff chose it out of my hand) and two Akkar&#39;s were played (with the Climbing Staff out) for basically 6 energy. Dewstone was making things easy for additional energy, and eventually there was a huge wall of creatures with Elder Yark and another Sagawal in play by the time Brog was defeated. Drig came out, and Jeff conceded at that point; confident he couldn&#39;t survive. I asked to see his hand, and he was right...nothing enough to stand to the giant boulders. A very close game; and one that bore watching by others.<br />
Elsewhere, Ryan battled Adam, but Adam was crushed by Ryan&#39;s non-offensive yet aggressive Weave deck (again with Ryan having the huge hand and the continual Brushfires; and Adam being unable to really kill things like Uwamar with energy removal spells...). Sarah battled Travis (the two weaker players; which was a toss up as to who would win); with Sarah eventually coming out on top.<br />
