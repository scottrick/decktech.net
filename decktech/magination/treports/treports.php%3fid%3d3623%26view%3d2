After analyzing the new set, I had three or four deck ideas for the Atlanta DPC.  I really liked Paradwyn, and could go with either the Stalker or Wildflower strategies, because both looked very potent.  After reading Crushing Winds and Hurricane Orish, simply updating Shimmer Superstar became a strong possibility, as I wouldn&#39;t have to get to many cards to pull it off and I had a lot of experience with the deck.  The fourth was a not so strong possibility of a Cald deck running Barak the Red/Vorga/ Ashgar, but I threw that one out the window shortly thereafter because most of my games were reliant on luck and/or drawing factors.<br>
<br>
The more I tested the other three the more I liked the Shimmer.  I figured there would be a lot of Paradwyn and a lot of Weave at the DPC, but other than that I didn&#39;t really know what to expect.  So I started tweaking my deck, adding an Epik to deal with Ormagon/Paradywn and three Hurricane Orishes to make Shimmer that much better (who says going to 0 energy makes you vulnerable to Cataclysm?).  I also added another Cataclysm myself after playing against that darned Wildflower deck and seeing just how much energy it can gain in a turn.<br>
<br>
So a week before the tournament I compare notes with a very trusted deck advisee of mine, Darkness, and ask him what he thinks might give the Shimmer deck trouble.  Well, his clairvoyant powers must have been at work, because he said while it would be able to handle creature themes it might have some trouble with Orothe stealing themes (at this point all the Orothe stealing themes I had seen were Voda/Arosa/Quilla or M&#39;Rika/Arosa/Quilla).  So I began testing against what I thought was Orothe steal, and ended up adding that much more removal to deal with Voda + Reef Hyren.  Here is the decklist I ended up playing:<br>
<br>
Magi (o3)<br>
Delia<br>
Shimmer<br>
Sorreah<br>
<br>
Creatures (20)<br>
Hurricane Orish - 3<br>
Vellup - 3<br>
Elder Vellup - 3<br>
Flutter Yup - 3<br>

Xyx Minor - 3<br>
Warlum - 1<br>
Epik - 1<br>
<br>
Spells (13)<br>
Crushing Winds - 3<br>
Shockwave - 3<br>
Cataclysm - 2<br>
Thunderquake - 2<br>
Tranquility - 1<br>
Sorreah&#39;s Dream - 1<br>
Shooting Star - 1<br>
<br>
Relics (o7)<br>
Storm Ring - 2<br>
Storm Shield - 2<br>
Relic Stalker - 2<br>
Arderian - Guard Wings - 1<br>
<br>
Fast forward to the day of the tournament:<br>
<br>
I meet my teammates Danny Young and Daniel Robertson at around 11 so we could possibly play a few games before the tournament started, plus Danny had yet to get a K&#39;gyn for his deck and Daniel still needed an Arosa and some Reef Hyrens for his deck.  We started getting a little worried when there were only five or six people at around 11:45, but by the time the tournament was about to get started 18 people had shown up. (Wow!)  Also, shortly before the tournament was to begin I see a couple people looking at a deck and saying something to the effect of &quot;this deck better get nerfed before worlds&quot; and my stomach turns.  I figured someone would think of some horrific combo and just sweep the DPC with it, that was what happened at one of the Star Wars DPCs and is often the case with such a large tournament.  On to the rounds:<br>
<br>
<font color=&quot;blue&quot;>Round 1 vs. Daniel Roberston (Voda/Arosa/Quilla)</font><br>
He wins the die roll and opts to go first.  He flips Voda, plays Reef Hyren, double subermerges and says go.  I know that the whole course of the game will rely on my opening hand, so I just take the Vellup and draw up to five.  I breathe a sigh of relief to see Cataclysm in my hand, which I play before playing 2 Vellups, and say go.  He plays Bog Wellisk and I think the Coral Hyren which ended up getting bigger at the end of his turn and says go.  I crushing Winds the Bog Wellisk and play another Vellup, say go.  He attacks and kills one, plays another creature.  I shockwave the huge creature and swarm over some Vellups for the kill.  Arosa comes out and kills Delia with a TidalWave (she had 0e), then plays some creature..  Shimmer comes out and plays a ton of creatures which all get considerably bigger at end of turn.  He Curse of the Abaquist to gain control of one of one of my creatures and Shell games to gain contorl of my Flutter Yup by giving me Blue Yajo.  Well, the Blue Yajo can&#39;t attack, but it can use 3 energy to add 6 to the Flutter Yup :).  I attack and kill the creature he stole from me with Curse and then went to 0 energy, shell gamed back and then processed Storm Shield and Shimmer.  He plays out some more creatures and does the old Shell game again.  I am trying to think of a way to get around Flutter Yup, so I keep using the Xyx to remove some energy from his magi, shell game his creature back and then process my end of turn effects.  Finally it gets to where I Xyx Arosa down to 0 energy, and at end of turn when he got his Blue Yajo back and it lost 1e it left him with no creatures and Quilla came out to play.  There wasn&#39;t much the poor mermaid could do seeing as Shimmer had so much time to setup.  There must have been 8 or 9 creatures with 8 or 9 energy apiece, so even after Tidal Wave I had a massive force to just run her over.<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons:</b> Playtesting pays off.  After all the work I put into the deck to make sure it could handle Voda, I&#39;m glad it did :)<br>
<b>Record:</b> 1-0<br>
<br>
When I finish my first round I look over at Van Russell&#39;s game and my face drops.  I see Arosa and 1,000 relics on the board, and he&#39;s gained control of all his opponent&#39;s creatures in one turn.  I then hear that he and Robert Nicaise are playing the same deck, and this deck is just broken.  I pray to the pairing gods that I never have to play one of them.....<br>
<br>
<font color=&quot;blue&quot;>Round 2 vs. Robert Nicaise (O&#39;Qua/Arosa/Quilla)</font><br>
So I sit down eager to see how I am going to get beaten.  Not knowing how his deck starts, I win the die roll and opt to go first (doh!).  He flips over O&#39;Qua, conjures a Bubble Xyx, draws three cards, and says go.  I play a swarm of Vellups and Crushing Winds the Bubble Xyx.  On his turn, he Conjures a Bubble Xyx, draws some cards, plays a Barl, draws some cards, and says go.  I attack and defeat O&#39;Qua, played a Hurricane Orish, and say go.  He reveals Arosa, plays Abaquist and Corathan, plays Ring of Secrets and various other relics pumping the Abaquist, gains control of a creature, draws some cards and gains some energy with the Karak Jewelry, puts a card back in hand with Corathan, Warrior&#39;s Boots out a 2e River Abaquist, gain control of a creature, draw some cards and gain some energy from Karak Jewelry, gets a River Abaquist back with Corathan... Do you see where this is going?  Yeah, so Delia dies pretty quick, but I have a Cataclysm and 2 Xyx in my hand while he&#39;s doing this and I&#39;m thinking Please go down to 8e, please go down to 8e.  Well, on top of having an insane deck, Robert also happens to be a great player, and I think keeping Cataclysm in mind he didn&#39;t put Arosa under about 15e the entire time.  I am forced to Cataclysm anyway because of his massive board, but even then Corathan is saved from a newly drawn Barqua&#39;s Bubble.  I don&#39;t have many more options, and he reestablishes his side of the board and steals all my stuff in one turn.  ONE TURN!  Shimmer falls quickly, out comes Sorreah who has to Cataclysm again, but it only takes him one more turn to kill me.  Bah.<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons:</b> I think the only thing I could possibly have done in that game to make it go any differently would have been gone first and killed O&#39;Qua so quickly that Arosa didn&#39;t have the cards to setup.  Even then, however, Karak Necklace pretty much means that if he can manage to steal one thing of mine and draw some cards it&#39;s all over.  Now I&#39;m just hoping to go 4-1 and make top four, cause winning is not a possibility with this deck here.<br>
<b>Record:</b>1-1<br>
<br>
<font color=&quot;blue&quot;>Round 3 vs. Roy Jones (Dark Twins/Warrada)</font><br>
He flips over Dark Twins, grabs Entomb, Corrupt, and Corathan, and draws up to seven.  He holds the Entomb in his hand, thinks about it long and hard, and says &quot;Entomb uhh.. Shockwave&quot;  !! Dangit.  I don&#39;t know how he knew I was playing Arderial, he probably didn&#39;t but in his area I think Arderial is pretty common and he figured it&#39;d be a safe bet.  Whatever the reason, I wanted to punch myself for not including Mantle of Shadows (which I could fetch using Vellup chain and Warlum).  He plays Corathan and Corrupt and says go.  Of course my opening hand has a Shockwave just sitting there dead for the whole game :(.  I play my Vellup swarm (he gets the first one), and since he stole a creature of mine he gets Entomb back with Corathan.  I grab Epik with the Elder Vellup, and use it to grab two of the three creatures in his handd.  While looking at his hand, I see 2 Tidal Waves... :(  I draw a Shockwave and a Cataclysm (thanks a bunch Entomb).  Dark Twins energize and Entomb TidalWave before playing it.  Roy is a good player, and before he did anything he thought about what the possible outcomes would be and/or how I was going to deal with it, and what magi I may have next etc.  So, after defeating Delia he Entombs Cataclysm (my hand is pretty much useless).  This is the worst case scenario for me: flipping over Shimmer without the cards to put her at 0 energy.  I play a Hurricane Orish, Elder Vellup, and Xyx Minor which gets bigger, but since I can&#39;t go down to 0 none of my creatures get bigger :(.  On his turn he Warrior&#39;s Boots in a Chaos Jile to kill the Orish (which at least gave Shimmer 3 back), and then says go.  I play Storm Ring from my hand, Elder Vellup attacks and kills Chaos Jile and Xyx Minor kills Dark Twins.  I draw two cards, one of which is a Storm Ring (already in play) and the other is a Cataclysm (entombed).  This has got to be the worst my deck has ever treated me in a game, but I feel at this point I could still pull out a win since I&#39;m on my second magi and he&#39;s on his third.  He flips Warrada and Tidal Waves my two creatures.  I simply draw two.  He gets Dark Blooming, plays Corrupt and Corathan, and says go.  I am finally able to go to 0 energy but I have to give him a Xyx Minor from Corrupt to do so, leaving me with Elder Vellup.  I draw two and start to say &quot;At the end of my turn&quot; and realize I forgot to play the Storm Shield!  His Corathan and Xyx Minor both lose one energy anyway, but this is the point when I realize just how flustered I am.  Well, he doesn&#39;t kill me that turn.  On my turn, I Crushing Winds the Corathan, but since I can&#39;t kill Warrada on that turn I want to leave Minor alive so he doesn&#39;t get Dark Blooming.  The turns go back and forth for a while with me playing a few creatures which get killed and vice versa, until finally he defeats Shimmer because I just can&#39;t get a good hand.  (I had all the relics that were already in play plus all 3 Shockwaves and both Cataclysms).  Sorreah comes out and is forced to give him a Xyx Minor from Corrupt then play a Hurricane Orish of his own, then, since Sorreah meant I was no longer worried about Dark Blooming I Crushing Winds the Xyx Minor I just gave him.  Well, this just isn&#39;t my day because he is playing Climbing Staff to permanantly cancel Suppress.  Warrada gains 10 energy, Tidal Waves the Orish, and 2 Dark Ayebaws spell instant doom for Sorreah.  Ergh....<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons:</b>I could kick myself for not playing Mantle of Shadows.  He and his deck were good, but I feel like some playing mistakes on my part kept me from doing better than I could have that game.  Corrupt continuously hurt me, and I am thinking Beam of Light would have been better than Relic Stalker except that Warlum can&#39;t fetch BoL.<br>
<b>Record:</b>1-2<br>
<br>
So now I know I&#39;m just playing consolation matches and I&#39;m there to have a good time, but there is no way I was going to drop after paying $20 ;).<br>
<br>
<font color=&quot;blue&quot;>Round 4 vs. Christopher Willams (M&#39;lady Iyori/Ninx/Kioko)</font><br>
I win the die roll so he goes first and reveals M&#39;lady Iyori.  He then plays T&#39;kanzam and Weave Powder and says go.  I reveal Delia, play the Vellup swarm using Elder Vellup to fetch Epik, use the Epik to grab both his creatures from his hand, and while I&#39;m looking in his hand I see Crushing Vines so I play Tranquility and end my turn.  He discards Weave Powder to get Junjertrug Horn, uses the Horn to get a Junjertrug, discards the Trug with Iyori to make me kill a Vellup, and says go.  I shooting Star a Vellup, Shockwave the T&#39;kanzam and attack and kill Iyori.  I also play Arderian-Guard Wings to protect from the Crushing Vines.  He reveals Ninx, plays Uwamar Beads, Poison Baloo Root and two Scarletsong Hwits, then Liriel&#39;s Cape to make them all gargantuan, and Staredowns Delia.  Scarletsong Hwits are good, and after playing a Storm Ring I have to work my attacks around in a very strange way to get around the powers, and after attacks are done I have a small Elder Vellup and he has a Hwit.  I then play Xyx Minor and Flutter Yup, and Crushing Winds the Hwit, taking Delia to 0e.  I play Storm Shield from hand to give all my creatures another energy.  He plays Hardshell Weebo, Taglat, and K&#39;teeb, then adds some energy with the Weebo and K&#39;teeb and uses Taglat to copy Strengthen from Storm Shield and add one to each of his creatures.  On my turn, the Xyx Minor gets bigger, I shockwave the K&#39;teeb, and attack and kill the Weebo with Elder Vellup.  On his turn he plays two K&#39;Teeb Thumpers and double-thumps Xyx Minor, but it only loses 2 because of Guard Wings.  Taglat copies Guard Wings this time and it&#39;s my turn.  I attack with the Yup since it loses nothing against Taglat, Xyx Minor and Elder Vellups kill the Thumpers.  He doesn&#39;t have much he can do, so on my next turn my creatures run over Ninx before I play a Hurricane Orish.  He reveals Kioko and plays Bagala Fangs (Orish adds 3) and some other creatures, then does some tricks to setup a defense with Kioko.  I Shockwave one of the creatures he played, so even after Kioko keeps the Xyx Minor from doing too much damage I sitll manage to defeat her.<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons:</b> Once again playtesting paid off.  I put removal in the deck for stuff like Paradwyn and it worked.  Arderian-Guard Wings was key that game, and Storm Shield helped a lot too.  He said himself that not having any relic removal in his deck had been hurting him all day.<br>
<b>Record:</b> 2-2   <br>
<br>
Between each round they had been printing standings and pairings, and maybe I looked at it wrong but after looking at the standings sheet it looked like someone who was 3-2 could make it into the final four as long as certain people lost and certain people won.  So, as slim of a chance as it was, I went into the fifth round still with a small marigin of hope of making it into top four.<br>
<br>
<font color=&quot;blue&quot;>Round 5 vs. Danny Young (K&#39;ygn/Wessig/Targ&#39;n)</font><br>
Great, so at an 18 person tournament with 5 rounds I have to play BOTH my teammates.  That&#39;s life for ya. I also don&#39;t remember many of the details from this game as I&#39;ve played this match-up before and all the times we&#39;ve played are running together. I know have to be on the lookout because Ritual Spearing Wessig kills Shimmer without Hurricane Orish out.  I knew I&#39;d have to play smart;<br>
Danny&#39;s a good player and he was after Shimmer with a vengence.  I win the die roll and let him go first.  He plays Kybar&#39;s Scroll and a creature then searches with the scroll.  I play my usual Vellup swarm and grab and play Epik, which is negated with Climbing Staff.  He attacks and kills a Vellup then searches with Scroll again.  He also plays Dew Stone (which, under most circumstances would mean it would take four attacks to kill K&#39;ygn.  Not to mention there wasn&#39;t enough energy on my creatures at that point to take him out).  HOWEVER, I play Storm Ring and Relic Stalker the Dewstone, which then gives me enough energy to barely take K&#39;ygn down, but it left Delia with 1 or 2 energy.  Wessig comes out, and I figure after 2 high dice rolls for Kybar&#39;s Scroll he&#39;s probably got the Spear in hand, the question is does he have Warrior&#39;s Boots.  Well, I don&#39;t think he did, and he also debated on whether he should Spear at all cause I know he wanted to save it to kill Shimmer.  So, in the end he just Stone Storms two of my creatures and plays Sagawal and Stone Quor, then uses the Quor to squeeze the Elder Vellup.  On my turn I Sorreah&#39;s Dream squeeze to squeeze the Quor, but I don&#39;t have much energy with which to attack so I just play a recurred Vellup (I think).  He Jagged Rocks on his turn and says go.  I Crushing Winds the Sagawal and attack and defeat Quor and Wessig, but that kills all my creatures and relics.  I play Xyx Minor and Yup, then Shooting Star tricks to pump the Minor.  Targ&#39;n comes out and plays a big creature before ritual spearing back to K&#39;ygn, who plays Dewstone again.  I Shockwave the creature, Relic Stalker the Dewstone, pump the Xyx Minor, and once again have just enough to defeat K&#39;ygn.  <br>
<br>
<b>Lessons:</b> While I have read articles or heard people talk that you should never defeat a magi until you are ready to deal with their next one, this game is strong evidence that if at any point you can find a way to defeat their magi, do so at all costs.  Had he ritual speared the Wessig and had some way to defeat Delia, the game would have been a totally different story.<br>
<b>Record:</b>3-2<br>
<br>
So I ended up with a winning record and coming in 7th out of 18 at the first professional Magi-Nation tournament; not bad :)  Top four action wasn&#39;t too exciting since everyone knew the Akido deck was going to win, and in the end there wasn&#39;t even a final match.  I was happy to see Blair Simpson take Shimmer into the final four even if I couldn&#39;t get her there, but for all you people who say Shimmer is not good I think Blair and I have proven otherwise ;)<br>
