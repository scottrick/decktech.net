2-11-2004<br />
<br />
Once again, I had Wednesday off from work. Knowing that my other plans would prevent me from attending a tournament on Saturday after work, I decided to go to Century Magic and see if I could play a few games.<br />
<br />
Chase and Bond Williams were there, and it was looking like Adam Bates might participate as the fourth player. The tournament was delayed a bit as Bond was teaching another person how to play. They didnt have time to stay for the tournament that night, but it looks like theyll join in the mayhem soon.<br />
<br />
While we waited, I played a quick game with Chase and Tom Seibet called to say he was coming. Adam dropped to keep the tournament at four players. Chase asked to borrow Adams Underneath deck, and Bond responded by asking if he could borrow one of my decks as well. I let him borrow my own Underneath deck in the possibility he should be pitted against his brother.<br />
<br />
With my Underneath deck in the hands of another player, I ruled out playing Weave. My burrow deck can totally shutdown my Weave deck. I almost went with Bograth, but the Muck Vinocs were not very likely to find much to hit because of the lack of big Underneath creatures in my deck as only the Kier starts with more than six energy in that deck. I debated going with Naroom with its Giant Carillion and Weebo tactics, but I thought I would give my adept deck a swing at it.<br />
<br />
First Round<br />
<br />
Bond and I were paired off against each other. This game pitted my two decks against each other, both posted on DeckTech already (Under It All and Ladies of the Sky). The burrow theme came early and quickly between Pylofuf and a Hidden Door that fetched Strags Ring. This hurt me a lot. Delia mightve tossed down well at first, but I was burning Sandswirls and Abwyns Gift to get through the mess as best I could. After Delia was defeated by Myka, I had Arderian Adept undream his burrowed Akkar at the end of the turn. Against an unknown Underneath deck, I mightve done things different, but I knew my own deck. There was no Ormagons to be afraid of. It was definitely to my advantage to maximize my creatures in play for Storm Shield and keep his energize down. After several turns of undreaming the Akkar, my Orathan Flyers had helped me place out an impressive swarm despite Crushing Fungus. I began attacking the burrowed creatures with my massive Aerial Flists and assorted creatures. It was merely a matter of time until my adept deck could work its way through the mess. However, the massive stall of my Underneath deck took the game to time. Technically, the game shouldve been called as a draw, however Adam Bates ruled the game as a win for me. Adam knows my Underneath deck has no copies of Ormagon and my adept deck controlled far in excess of forty energy in a multitude of creatures. It wouldve taken some time, but the end result was sure. Not drawing either of my Beam of Lights until the end also hurt terribly. Myka was still causing trouble with Strags Ring. Now, before anyone suggests Rayjes Belt or Sword, remember that it couldve been either of those cards sitting down at the end of the deck just the Beams of Light had. If I had one of them earlier on, I couldve ended the pain of Strags Ring and I couldve saved Abwyns Gift for Granas or Pylofuf instead (things that burrowed themselves).<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
I was impressed by Bonds quick ability to master most of my Underneath deck as well as the proof that it could hold its own very well in the hands of another player. That it took me to time was both annoying and impressive.<br />
Neg.<br />
So many are well informed that there is no Ormagon in my Underneath deck that I was surprised when I heard that Bond thought there was one in there to save him against the adept swarm. He admitted that he wouldve attacked more early into and through my growing swarm if he had known that. In many ways, that lack of action is what allowed the adept to swarm so terribly. He had a perfect combo to keep attacking for virtually free until I finally managed to end that threat with a Beam of Light.<br />
<br />
Final Round<br />
<br />
With the first round ending in a judgement by Adam, I was wondering how the second round and final round would go for me against Chase. He was using Adams Underneath deck. So, with more burrow ahead of me, I prepared for the worst. Ive heard tell of Adams deck before and how it is a good burrow deck. Well, Chase started off with Trygar and tossed down both a Pylofuf and Tunnelers Boots. Delia tore into the opening by using Sandswirl on the Pylofuf and having an Elder Vellup already in play tear into it. Since she only had two regular Vellups in play as well, they tore into Trygar with a free hit. This would foretell Trygars doom. While Chase did toss down another Pylofuf later on, an Abwyns Gift tore into Adams burrow theme even further. Unable to stall and draw the cards he needed with Trygar, Celebrated Hero shared the same fate as Delia crushed his Cave Rudwot and followed up with very annoying vellups. By this time, I was using a Storm Shield and Storm Ring as well. Since the adept deck was built for the middle magi and I had a great setup so far, I was letting Delia play right into an Ormagon. However, this never happened. With this extra energy gains, Delia flew past Celebrated Hero and took on Emaal on the end. Bates informed us that Emaal was there mostly for her energize. With Celebrated Hero being the central and most important magi, he was in the middle where he shouldve been able to do the most damage. It was finished in short enough order with Delia going all the way.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Against a normal burrow deck, my adept deck passed with flying colors. I was quite pleased because I dont consider my own burrow deck a standard burrow deck at all.<br />
Neg.<br />
It would have to be the burrow decks failure to stall. Without stalling, it couldnt really draw into the options it needed for Celebrated Hero to excel.<br />
<br />
It may be of interest to note that Bond also did very well in the second round. Now that he knew not to ever wait for an Ormagon that wasnt there, he tore into his opponent and I believe he went all the way with Myka.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, I traded some more rare cards for some more animite. Bond was very hesitant to part with his 50 animite, furok card. I couldnt promise him that I would still have it in the near future to trade to get back. Sometime soon, I plan to send in an animite order. I just wish I could be so lucky to pull animite when I place in these tournaments. However, since Century Magic has been having us randomly draw our prize support, Ive been getting plenty of foil cards. While the foil cards do trade well, there is a bunch of promos I never acquired that I would love to send in for.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
I made a bit of a mistake with the last tournament report. Somewhat embarrassing. While I did type in the correct date and such in WordPerfect (where I write these things before posting), it seems that I typed two twice instead of zero when entering it into the forms on DeckTech. So, it reads as if the tournament took place in 2204. Oops! If you read the report, you should catch that I put the correct date at the top of the text that I copied and pasted from WordPerfect. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php?id=4852&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
