Each day&#39;s report was the same game. So, I copied and pasted into WordPerfect and got the thing to look better. More like it is supposed to be. With some necessary corrections, here&#39;s the correct tournament report for January Online gatlingEngine, which is what I should&#39;ve called the report (and I repeated the name here too just so everyone could tell that this was the same report revised).<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been continuing to play Magi-Nation online. While I havent reported on all the tournaments, nor have I played in all of them, it has been fun to continue doing so. I have seen some decks that I wouldnt have seen otherwise. Played against mechanics I wouldve never imagined. And, I even gained the basic inspiration to build the Grahnna-Pyder deck I recently posted on DeckTech from an opponent I played in a casual game a couple times. <br />
<br />
This January, the beginning of 2006, Magi-Nation tournaments on gatlingEngine continued. Almost every month there has been some special rule that Novelty who runs them as set. The December tournament, which I missed, was a multi-player special. For the first month of this new year, the special rule was at least one Nar or Nar Shadow Magi and at least one arctic creature. I think everyone ended playing Nar. Some players skipped this tournament because they felt that variety would be lacking since everyone would be playing Nar. As for myself, I was excited since I dont see Nar played online that much. <br />
<br />
The deck I used is called Wall of Ice Too. I might add it to my list of decks on DeckTech. I dont have much time tonight, so maybe another day. In case you are wondering, it is the Restricted version of my deck Wall of Ice. I think the difference is mostly dropping the three Crystallize for three copies of Warriors Boots. I could be wrong about that, but I think it may be just that simple of a change to make it into a Restricted Deck. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, since I have been posting almost all of my games from gatlingEngine in a blog, writing this tournament report should be easy. Just a lot of cutting and pasting with some extra commentary, such as this introduction. <br />
<br />
Thursday, January 12, 2006 <br />
<br />
Today, after my game with Birdie21, I managed to get in my first game for the January tournament. CapAp signed up and we played against each other. After conferring with the rules, we found that a Nar magi and an arctic card are required to be in our decks for this tournament. Both of us met the minimum requirement for our decks. <br />
<br />
CapAp went first with Ust. Hailstorm Pendant would slowly destroy me. Combined with her powerful defensive effect against my first attack on the magi each turn, Ust would destroy Balachron. It didn&#39;t happen all at once. Although, that first turn with Furok Protector was just plain fun. CapAp took the furok with the first shot using the pendant. Their Zyavu was sacrificed to remove energy from my magi and one of my creatures. Balachron did get Ice Lens in play to increase my card draw for a few turns. At the same time, CapAp had Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel in play to make sure they had what they needed to destroy my forces. Odavast was grateful that Balachron had netted a few extra cards. This allowed him to place out a small swarm that CapAp began to destroy once again. Ust was getting attacked frequently and CapAp would frequently discard two cards to kill the first creature like the effect allowed. It seemed like a long terrible struggle to stay alive, then both copies of Warrior&#39;s Boots were drawn. The first one was used to place out something just big enough to make sure that Ust went down to the swarm I had in play. When CapAp played Spirit of Nar, it actually didn&#39;t matter to me. There wasn&#39;t much I could play at that point anyways. Koza was the next challenge for Odavast to face. Since Odavast had a good number of creatures in play when he beat Ust, another Warrior&#39;s Boots later and Koza was on the rocks. It was a swift battle between Odavast and Koza lasting no more than just a few turns. When Halsted flipped and used two copies of Crystallize, it looked like Odavast was in for a long haul. It was when CapAp tossed down a Zyavu as well that suddenly things looked better for me. It has been so long since I played Nar that I had forgotten that my deck currently uses Ice Rupture. Plus, I almost missed that it was in my hand. That was the same spell CapAp had used on me early into the game. Discarding one of my Crystallized creatures, Halsted made a very short appearance and Odavast managed to salvage a game I was afraid that I was losing but I just hadn&#39;t given up yet. <br />
<br />
Saturday, January 21, 2006 <br />
<br />
Saturday night I managed to get in another tournament game. I think I was online originally to take more notes for writing that Naroom 101 I have started despite my personal fears. By the time the game was done, I had long forgotten why I was online in the first place.<br />
<br />
I wish I could convey to you how intense the game was.<br />
<br />
Godofchaos started with Halsted. With Crystallize in hand, this would prove a powerful start against my deck which is built with much attacking in mind. Halsted would tear into Balachron. Then it was Odavast who would feel the constant pressure. With Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel in play, godofchaos was tearing through their deck for just the right cards. I would end being very grateful for the Furok Protectors when they showed up. With Halsted&#39;s high energize rate, that extra energy would be very helpful. Godofchaos was running a solid number of creatures as well. Keeping my creatures as frozen as possible would be very important. Turn after turn that Halsted should&#39;ve been able to beat Odavast, he would still be standing because of it. My wife looked over my shoulder in the middle of the game and I told her that I was getting thrashed good. Ice Lens would be my friend. Despite Halsted&#39;s penalty, I still used my Warrior&#39;s Boots and Ice Lens, the only relics in my deck. So, although I didn&#39;t have Tomorrow&#39;s Jewel sifting through my cards, a nice Ice Lens allowed me to build some hand advantage. This would help me take advantage of Odavast&#39;s effect, even allowing me to refreeze things with Whiteout when all my arctic creatures had been eliminated already. By the time Odavast escaped the threat Halsted held over him, he was beginning to gain some steam. Laranel would face him next. While her Furok Protector was healthy thanks to Odavast&#39;s energize of seven, Odavast pushed the initiative he had gained. Instead of paying penalties to her effects, I had Warriors Boots to push the offensive even more. By the time Laranel went, Velouria wasn&#39;t much of an issue. Although Odavast never gave Velouria a good chance to use her power, he also rarely had any energy left on him at this point. While in the end I managed to win, it was a very good game. In the mid-game, if you had asked me who was winning, I would&#39;ve told you godofchaos. They did say after it was done that Odavast&#39;s effect was what made things so tough for them. While I was trying to optimize his effect on the offensive, it also provided a great defense that kept me going when godofchaos wanted to finish Odavast&#39;s creatures off.<br />
<br />
Sunday, January 22, 2006 <br />
If my game yesterday with godofchaos was good, then perhaps my game today with freigabe was even better. If nothing else, it was a little bit faster.<br />

This time, I actually went first. Getting both an Ice Lens and Yaromant in those random five cards seemed like mana from heaven. That is, until freigabe flipped over Fray who started with a Yaromant. They even got an extra one in the starting hand. Two to one Yaromant didn&#39;t seem like good odds, and it showed. Balachron didn&#39;t last long against Fray. Shattershards was key to keeping Fray from netting a bunch of cards as well with a copy of Ice Lens. So, I enjoyed my card draw while I could. Odavast would then try and battle for all he was worth against Fray. Having my second Ice Lens in hand would help immensely. I am not sure he could&#39;ve pulled things around without it. By the time he finally he got past Fray with his pesky, partially invulnerable creatures, I was feeling good about things. I had a small swarm going with an Ice Arboll used to make it a little better. To my surprise, freigabe flipped over Odavast as their second magi as well. Ouch! That wasn&#39;t even the really sweet part of the deal. They had several creature and an Ice Arboll as well. Their Zyavu was quite large from Ice Arboll and the Mombak, so I would use the Aegris I had in play to get that while Thin Ice and an attack by my own Zyavu in play would take the Mombak. The third creature I had before had been eliminated already by freigabe on the turn they flipped over their Odavast. Two Odavast. Both wanting to keep things frozen to toughen the battle. Oh what a thrill! I was loving it so much that I forgot to pay attention to many details at that point. It was a very good game. A very good battle. In the end, the Odavast I controlled managed to sweep past Odavast. The turn before he got the other Odavast, I managed to pull off another Ice Arboll. After defeating Odavast, I tossed down a couple more creatures, including another Aegris. Freigabe flipped over Laranel and then declared gg. And, a very good game it was. My heart is still racing as I write this from the shear excitement. These are the sort of games that can give me a thrill.<br />

When the tournament ended, this gave me enough points to win. Having been awarded three points for each win, I couldnt help but notice that all my opponents had equal scores from their games with each other. This led me to believe that they had all had one more loss each and one win at least. There was one exception, and that was freigabe who got in a game with BobbyDoc. This gave freigabe second place and the title of most games played. <br />

Part of the tournament prize for January was to choose which region from the fanset currently being developed would be imported onto gatlingEngine first for playtesting. I chose Underneath, although I have been participating in this fan created expansion by creating text for the Naroom cards. <br />
<br />
The other part of the prize was tokens for the number of games played, usable this February, plus one token that can be reserved for any month so desired. More free games online, I cant complain. I promptly put in some more of my decks and got in a fun game using Punishing the Darkness as found on DeckTech. I managed to win that casual game with just Tiller against a Nar deck. I just might have a small Magi-Nation addiction. Too bad I havent found anyone in Minnesota/Wisconsin to play yet. I know there is someone over to the East not too far from where I am but I havent gone that way other than for work so far since moving here and as such havent met them. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php?id=5472&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
