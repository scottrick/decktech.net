Round 3:<br>
Kevin Codere<br>
Magi: Voda, Mobis, Quilla<br>
During the Dice roll I rolled a two and he rolled a four, he decided he was going to go first, when he revealed voda I suddenly knew why he wanted to go first he then played a Reef Hyren and a Coral Hyren, Voda then dropped to 3 to add 3 energy to Reef Hyren and having the Coral Hyren get one because of its effect. He then ended his turn and the 8 energy Reef Hyren became a 12 energy Reef Hyren.<br>
I Revealed my magi to be Delia while at the same time I hoped for a Shockwave or Cataclysm and I luckily started off my turn by Shockwaving the Reef Hyren away I then flocked in 3 Vellup and a Elder Velup allying a flutteryup in hand and ending my turn. During Kevin&#8217;s turn he had the coral Hyren attack one of my Vellups and then played Will of Oroth and sayed that I may not attack next turn, he then ended his turn with a smile, but the thing was he knew the Elder vellup was getting the energy&#8230;.I wonder what he drew? During my next turn I played Alaban Gloves and used Undream on the Coral Hyren, I then played a Flutteryup and ended my turn. During Kevin&#8217;s next trun I found out why he was smilling, he played a bwill and a Will of Orothe saying that my Flutteryup and my Vellups could not attack but the soon to be 14 energy Elder Vellup had to attack the bwill he then started smilling and ended his turn as the Elder Vellup went to 14, During my turn I did the smartest thing I could think of and I Undreamed the Elder Vellup back to my hand while the Energy went onto Delia, I then played a Lovian, a Vellup, the Elder Vellup and allied out another flutteryup and ended my turn. During Kevin&#8217;s turn he played a Deep Hyren and then used Hurricane Discarding the Deep Hyren and the Bwill to kill almost all of my creatures (1 Energy Lovian still alive)(and a 3 Energy Elder Vellup) he then ended his turn after the Suicide Effort.<br>
During my turn I Warrior Booted out a Elder Vellup and killed Voda, I then played a Brannix and two Xyx Minors and ended my turn. During Kevins turn he revealed his second magi to be Mois and has fun playing 2 Coral Hyren, 2 bwill, 2 Wellisk, and a phrup and then uses Submerge on his Coral Hyren and then ended his turn.<br>
During my turn I undreamed my Elder Vellup back to my hand, I then played a Cataclysm destroying my small army and his small army I then played another pair of Alaban gloves and a Dark Ayebaw, and a J&#8217;lith then Imploded on Mobis killing him. During Kevins next turn he revealed  his last magi to no surprise to be Quilla he then played Orothean Gloves, Karak Necklace and Hubdra&#8217;s Cube, he then took control of my alaban gloves and Undreamed my J&#8217;lith back into my hand then used a hidden Hubdra&#8217;s Spear he had in his hand and then playd Maelstrom to finish Delia off he then ended his turn. During my turn I Revealed Sorreah (Supress REALLY Helps against Quilla)I Then Warrior Booted in a Xyx and attack Quilla with it then I used Sorreah&#8217;s Dream on Shock and then used Lightning on the Xyx and the used the Xyx&#8217;s own shock to bring Quilla down to one energy I then played a Elder Vellup and Ended my turn. During Kevins turn he Undertows the Elder Vellup and ends his turn during my next run the Xyx finishs off Quilla ending the Match.<br>
