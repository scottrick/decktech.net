10/11/2003<br />
<br />
After a month of not making it to any tournaments, I was thinking that having this Saturday off wasn&#8217;t going to be any better. While Century Magic, my usual haunt, has been scheduling tournaments for every Saturday for the past couple months, there&#8217;s been insufficient players whenever I could make it. Inevitably, they would postpone the tournament until Monday or Tuesday evening, when I was working. Not confident that I could actually make it to a tournament, I checked the Magi-Nation website to see what was listed. To my pleasant surprise, there was one listed for Bountiful, Utah, a short drive away. Well, it seems fairly short to me, but I did grow up on some farmland in Minnesota (yes, I don&#39;t live in the same state anymore). That might have something to do with how I perceive things.<br />
<br />
Well, I showed up at End Zone Cards and Comics just about on time. To be honest, I almost got lost. Being in the area a little early, I thought I would risk getting off the interstate an exit early. That might have been a mistake. Now, the road I got off on actually leads fairly close to where I wanted to be, but I somehow confused myself and made a wrong turn too early. After finding my way out of the residential area I had gotten myself into, I continued a little further North and easily found a place to eat and my way to the tournament after that. As to how or why I made that wrong turn, I really don&#8217;t know now. If I had only gone a little further North.... I certainly recognized the correct turn.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Troy Davidson, the tournament director for this one, recognized me as I entered. And, shortly behind me, Matt Jensen, his brother, and a friend by the name of Steven arrived. With Chris and another Steven already there, this brought us up to six players. We wrote down our names, 2id numbers, and email addresses and pairings were assigned from there.<br />
<br />
I never did play against either of the Stevens in this tournament, and I really don&#8217;t know how their names were spelled. Hopefully, if either of them sees this, they won&#8217;t take offense if I&#8217;ve misspelled their name(s). I just thought it a bit entertaining to be introduced to the two Stevens. However, I do recall that Chris&#8217;s friend normally plays Underneath and was interested in my deck a bit, as he was hoping about mid-tournament that he could&#8217;ve had me as an opponent just to see it in action.<br />
<br />
That reminds me, I chose to use my Underneath deck. I only have two tournament decks constructed at the moment, and I run the other ten regions as less serious decks. Not that they are to be underestimated either, but they are not quite as, um, proven. While I have believed for a several months that my Underneath deck was definitely a tournament deck, I hadn&#8217;t actually used it as such. So, I was using &#8220;Under It All,&#8221; as posted on DeckTech, for this tournament. The deck uses Myka, Emaal, and Celebrated Hero to keep my energize rate decent, even with a Trogovo in play. The rest of the deck is a mix of easily burrowed creatures and spells that I should still be able to pull off with the Trogovo on the field.<br />
<br />
Round 1<br />
Luke Jensen, Kybar&#8217;s Teeth<br />
<br />
My first opponent was Luke Jensen. He is in my mind one of the best players of the teeth we have around here. Faithful to the region, his deck has seen much refinement. However, he bemoaned his loss before the game even began. If he had only seen my opening hand.... I don&#8217;t pull any starters with Myka, and it was a hand full of spells and relics. I almost cried. Determined to make the best of it, I used Gorgle&#8217;s Curse and used Strag&#8217;s Ring with purity to burrow his other creature. This opening lack of creatures continued to hurt me for a short while, and I was trying to make the best of my spells and relics. Fortunately, almost as if in compensation, the three Granas showed up early on, allowing me to come back from such a bad spot. Myka ended up taking out Kazm with a lot of work. Although, with Rayje&#8217;s Belt showing up several times, Luke tried to make that as difficult as possible. That, and he pulled off a few Oranragan in a row, destroying Strag&#8217;s Ring and another relic in the early game. After Kazm, Myka faced off against Celebrated Hero. By the time Gogor went down, Myka was getting stretched a little thin. However, I had left a Kybar&#8217;s Teeth/Underneath creature in play, an Akkar that I hoped would net some extra energy, if I recall correctly. I sort of anticipated the Wessig&#8211;Ritual Spear combo, being a favorite of his. Now, I was expecting him to return Kazm, but he chose Celebrated Hero. This ended up taking the game to time. He threw down an impressive yark combo, forcing me to deal with Yark but unable to attack and do much as long as he had Elder Yark and Slime Stone in play. I needed to get enough creatures out to overcome the combo. Unfortunately, as Myka struggled to accomplish this, we reached time and the game was called as a draw. End result, Myka went to time. I was pleased, even if it was a draw. Luke played quite well, and that yark combo he sprang on me was making real trouble for my deck, worse than the belt or a sword.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
I got to see a bit of Luke&#8217;s Kybar&#8217;s Teeth deck. Great deck, and kept me on the defensive more than I would&#8217;ve liked with it&#8217;s strong yark theme. While it had me in quite a bind as his opponent, I think it looks like a great mod for his deck.<br />
Neg.<br />
It could be the opening hand with no creatures. Or, for Luke, it could be a Ritual Spear that only cleared out a few relics of mine as my creature in play was Kybar&#8217;s Teeth as well as Underneath.<br />
<br />
Round 2<br />
Christopher Mee, Core<br />
<br />
Two of the three games had gone to time in the first round. Matt Jensen is the only one who actually won, and his opponent was the only person that actually lost so far. Well, Chris and I were both trying to recover from our draws. I won the dice roll and went first. This time, I had a slightly better starting hand. Although I already knew he was playing Core, I tossed down a Trogovo to at least correct it. He waited to get his starters until his turn, a good call. Flipping over Warrada, he fetched the tomes, her ring, and Essence of Naroom. He used Tomes of the Great Library to play Tidal Wave from his deck a few times. And, those first several rounds things were looking fairly creatureless for the two of us. As such, it was looking good for Warrada, until some of my creatures started living. This was one of those times that Urigant served me well. Burrowed against spells while I controlled the Pylofuf next to it, that Flame Geyser he tossed out with his research only did minor damage as even my magi was burrowed. It was starting to look up for Myka, and Digging Goggles allowed my burrowed minions to strike out at an undefended Warrada. He did start throwing out a few creatures, but I now had the initiative against that twisted magi. When she went down, that&#8217;s where things got nasty. He flipped over the Dark Twins and played a couple Entomb. One for a power spell of mine, Gorgle&#8217;s Curse, and the other for the Grow he had in his deck. Actually, he named Gorgle&#8217;s Gift, the Cald spell, on mistake, but I was willing to honor his true intention and even told him of his error&#8211;sometimes I am just too nice. He played out a Wudge, a couple Koil, and a Vrill. I think there may have been an Orok too. Anyways, he played Grow on the Vrill and rolled a five, after using it&#8217;s power, his little army was growing massively out of control. For once, I wished for an Ormagon. As it was, my Ormalets helped trim things back down a bit, although the Shadow Cloak he had meant I could only use the spells and powers of my deck directly against his creatures every other turn. I suicided my own magi though to help keep up with his energize and to come up with the energy I needed to deal with such a swarm. Emaal was a definite suicide magi, and I used Crushing Fungus several times to keep him under control, and an impacted Ormalet with no energy on Emaal was overkill on what little energy the Dark Twins had at the moment. Celebrated Hero managed to pull a win with some Pylofufs, more crushing, and some Attekia&#8217;s Gifts. That swarm was just too far out of control for a single magi of mine to handle.<br />

A refreshing change with the Dark Twins being very nicely setup by Warrada. It left me fighting an uphill battle to overcome their massive energy advantage.<br />

If you ask him, it has to be Entombing the wrong spell. Crushing Fungus was making a real mess of things.<br />

Round 3<br />
Matt Jensen, Paradwyn<br />
<br />
I knew I was in for a tough battle here. At first, I thought I might see the Makoor Bomb I had read about. However, he followed his own advice, and used something different. I do admit to being caught off-guard when he flipped over Arawan. The first thing that I thought was Ookami is coming and this is going to be difficult. Any Ormalets I drew were going to be saved for those Lahalous and Hardshell Weebos that Arawan searched for. He also pulled a K&#8217;teeb, great choice if you ask me. The Fog Hyren, though, put the card draw a little higher than I would&#8217;ve liked. Arawan needed to go down fast, or I needed a good setup going into Ookami. Unable to find a quick enough defeat for Arawan, I tried to setup for Ookami. This paid off a bit. Painful, as expected, but it worked out in the end. And, yes, Ookami was his second magi, same slot I would&#8217;ve put him in. Myka and Emaal went down. Although, I setup Emaal for defeat when I played out all her energy. Much like terrible bait. However, Matt demonstrated why he&#8217;s a great player and left Emaal with a one energy creature at the end of his attack step. Then, playing as much of his energy as he could, he tossed down a dreamwarping Poison Baloo Root. So, he didn&#8217;t fall for the bait as planned. Most of the game was almost a magi for magi struggle. In the end, it came down to Celebrated Hero versus Iain, not who I was expecting. This meant trouble for me. Like his brother, Matt was also using Rayje&#8217;s Belt. While digging up my burrowed creatures in attacks hasn&#8217;t hurt my deck thus far, Matt really tore into my burrowed creatures on the spells/powers/relics step using a few Ambush. Iain basically guaranteed more pain. Plus, a few Bulabantus to add to the mix, and it just wasn&#8217;t looking too good for Gogor. However, I used Gorgle&#8217;s Curse to defend myself. This time, I was playing things dangerous with no creatures to defend my magi. Sometimes, with only one energy to spare. Another Gorgle&#8217;s Curse later, I was starting to save up enough energy to actually do something. Now, don&#8217;t forget, Crushing Fungus was also making a showing during all of this. On my last turn, I had enough energy to play an Ormalet, Crystal Arboll, and a Crushing Fungus. Well, technically, I would&#8217;ve had one more turn, but we called the game there. Ormalet cleared out both the &#8220;cursed&#8221; creatures and the third Paradwyn creature only had four energy or so. Crushing Fungus took care of that and Crystal Arboll healed the Ormalet. This would&#8217;ve been very dangerous, and I wouldn&#8217;t have done it quite so, except Iain only had one energy. Unable to energize, and only one energy, there wasn&#8217;t anything Matt could do to stop my win except a Spirit of Rayje. We joked about that a bit. I must commend Matt on a great game. And, a great game it was, neither of us giving up much to our opponent the whole way through.<br />

Pos.<br />
Great battle. Arawan setup Ookami nicely. And we can agree that Crushing Fungus is one of the best crushing spells. Some of the others are great, but not quite the same league.<br />
Neg.<br />
It&#39;s a tough call, but it seemed that Matt couldn&#8217;t hit my magi directly with spells or powers. Even a single Warrior&#8217;s Boots could&#8217;ve spelled doom for me when I was playing things so dangerously.<br />
<br />
They&#8217;ve got a great group up in Bountiful. It is a real joy to drive up there and play. The store is still offering great prize support. For a small entry fee of two dollars, everyone got a booster pack plus some. They handed out hats, pins, and even some extra booster packs. I had a hard time choosing a pin, so I asked if the other players knew which one I should take. There was d&#8217;Resh, Nar, Paradwyn, and Bograth to choose from. It finally came down to d&#8217;Resh, well, because I had a d&#8217;Resh deck that could tear through most, if not all, of my decks&#8211;I took it apart a while back to mess around with other stuff.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, Matt was asking if anyone had a Darkbreed Hyren for trade. It seems that he promised someone else to trade one, and had forgotten that he was out. Strangely, I had brought my actual collection with me, and not just my playable decks. After the tournament, I brought in my massive box and found that I actually had two copies. Since I don&#8217;t see myself playing with it anytime soon, I gladly parted with one for a copy of The Prankster. To have had the chance to play some great games, trade for last month&#8217;s promo, and visit with some great people.... oh, I was happy. I don&#8217;t think my day could&#8217;ve been much better than that. Well, I can think of something, but that&#8217;s in the realm of fantasy. As it is, I&#8217;ll take the great time I had in reality.<br />
<br />
I hope I can make it back to Bountiful in the not too distant future. My work schedule isn&#8217;t the greatest, so I am not sure when that will be. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php?id=4700&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/magination/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/magination/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table></td>
