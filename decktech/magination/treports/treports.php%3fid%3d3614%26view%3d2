<br>
I&#39;ve had this deck on wraps since 2 days after the Release of Nightmare&#39;s Dawn. I threw together the first version, and it was silly good. I tweaked and play tested a little more, and hoped to keep it on ice until World&#39;s. However, people began to post decks hinting at the same strategy and Magi Order. The decks, in my opinion, were not as strong as this one, but I knew it would soon be discovered by someone.<br>
<br>
So, I tell Robert (Dr. Bob) that I intend to take this deck to the Invitational in order to test it against the field in a tournament. Dr. Bob had suffered through the playtesting, and asked for a decklist so he could take it as well. I agreed, proud of my creation. He named it &quot;Akido&quot; because like the style of martial arts, it used it&#39;s opponents strength against them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday Morning<br>
<br>
<br>
Regristation began at 12. We had 18 attendants, meaning 5 rounds of swiss with the top 4 competing for the cash prizes.<br>
<br>
<br>
First Round:<br>
<br>
Akido Vs Paradyn Weenie (played by Jerry Hill)<br>
<br>
Jerry Came to Dr. Bob&#39;s Shop the previous Thursday to do some playtesting with us. He&#39;d been looking for a deck, and he liked the Paradwyn Deck I had been testing. I felt somewhat ashamed for keeping Akido secret, since it is very much his style of deck.<br>
<br>
Jerry was using the following Magi order:<br>
<br>
Arawan/Ookami/Iain<br>
<br>
The general idea of this deck is to use Arawan to search out creatures to play on Ookami, while playing Myrdra&#39;s to defend until your hand is set up. <br>
When you go to Ookami from Arawan, its not uncommon to have 80+ energy worth on creatures in play and on your Magi. My record thus far with the deck has been 158 energy on creatures, with 1 left on Ookami at the end of the turn in which I revealed Ookami.<br>
<br>
The game began slow. Both of us searching out creatures to get some cards in our hands. When I had my setup, I let Jerry take out O&#39;Qua.<br>
<br>
On my turn, I play a Corthan and some theft creatures, and take his 2 weak creatures, Storm for Relics to remove his Capes and Staff&#39;s, and Implosion Arawan to defeat him.<br>
<br>
Jerry Reveals Ookami, plays 3 K&#39;teebs and a Poison Baloo Root. He copies the Poison Baloo Root with all his guys, and drops the energy on my creatures by 4, killing both the guys I stole, and leaving my Corathan at 1 energy. <br>
<br>
I play 2 River Abaquist, and then steal 1 K&#39;teeb. I copy the River Abaquist I have in play with that K&#39;teeb, and steal another. I use his guys to steal his own guys, returning the Implosion to my hand. I Implosion him, and Storm again for spells (fearing possible Spell Pusle.) He shows me an Ambush.<br>
<br>
He reveals Iaian, and plays some little guys. Uses a Cape to pump them up a bit, and says &quot;Go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, I play the River Abaquists and Corathan, and steal all his guys, then Implosion him. <br>
<br>
Jerry was a good sport, and really liked the deck. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Second Round:<br>
<br>
My opponent informs me that he is new to the game, and to forgive him if he has to ask what all my cards do. I assure him that it is fine, and tell him I was once a new player too.<br>
<br>
He was playing Kybar&#39;s Teeth, with Kazm as his first Magi.<br>
He wins the roll, and chooses to play first. He plays a Giant Baldar, and say&#39;s &quot;Go.&quot;<br>
<br>
I Conjure out a Bubble Xyx, and draw some cards. I remind my opponent that he gains energy for Kazm when I summon. I play a Sea Barl and draw some more cards and give him some more energy, then say go.<br>
<br>
I hold him off a turn or two with the weak and used summoned guys, then allow him to finish off O&#39;Qua. <br>
<br>
I reveal Arosa, and begin the theft. He asks the Judge whether or not I get to keep his 10, 8, 6, and 6 energy creatures when his Magi is defeated. The Judge answers him, and he concedes. <br>
<br>
I felt really bad, and apologized for the deck. I dread running off new players from the game. However, he took it well, and continued throughout the tournament. When I talked to him later, he was enjoying the competition, and said he had learned a lot. <br>
<br>
<br>
Third Round:<br>
<br>
My opponnt is playing Weave, a region I really don&#39;t fear when playing this deck. By now, everyone&#39;s seen Dr. Bob and I playing the deck, and he smiles and says he&#39;s ready for his loss. I tell him there&#39;s always a chance, and we roll. <br>
<br>
He was using Ninx/Tasia/Kesia.<br>
<br>
I win the roll, and start drawing cards. He chooses not to kill O&#39;Qua at his first chance, and I manage to draw nearly through my entire deck. <br>
<br>
I suicide O&#39;Qua, and reveal Arosa on my next turn. My opponent sighs. <br>
<br>
I Storm for spells, but only hit a Sawgrass. I lose a Beam of Light. I see 4 relics in my opponents hand and 2 creatures. I steal his 2 small guys, and return the Storm to my hand with Corathan. I dump my relics in play, and Storm for Relics losing an Abraxin&#39;s Crown. <br>
<br>
His Magi falls the following turn. <br>
<br>
I energize, Forsight, and Lore, then say go.<br>
<br>
He plays Aritex, Bungaloo, 2 Uwamar, and a Yajo.<br>
<br>
I undertow the Yajo, Tidal Wave the 2 Uwamar, and then steal his Aritex and Bungaloo with Boot&#39;s in River Abaquist&#39;s. I Heal using the Bungaloo, and say go.<br>
<br>
He plays 2 creatures, and sighs.<br>
<br>
On My turn, I Thunderquake his 2 creatures and attack to defeat his last Magi. <br>
<br>
We shake hands, and congratulates me on the deck, and I wish him luck in the tourney.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fourth Round:<br>
<br>
The Dark Twins/Warrada played by Roy<br>
<br>
Roy is a friend of Jerry&#39;s, and comes to playtest with Dr. Bob and a few others at the store. I know what he&#39;s playing because he always plays core ;P<br>
<br>
He gets Entomb, Corthan, and Corrupt as his starting cards and draws 4 more. <br>
<br>
He plays the Corthan, a Dark Ayebaw, and the Corrupt. He thinks a bit, and decides to Entomb Cure of the Abaquist. He knows what I&#39;m playing, but he wasn&#39;t sure what I was using. ;(<br>
<br>
I draw 5 Random Cards, then Summon out a Hunter Jile. I play a Sea Barl, and then use the Hunter Jile. He Climbing staff&#39;s it and smiles, then I draw 2 cards and say &quot;go.&quot;<br>
<br>
He kills O&#39;Qua, and plays some other creature. ;(<br>
<br>
I flip Arosa, and get my starting cards. I play a Corathan and some relics and a Bubble Xyx. I play a Forgotten Dancer and stea/kill his Corathan. I return the Hunter Jile from my discard to my hand. I shell game him the 1 energy Abaquist, and draw 2 cards.<br>
<br>
He plays a creature after he suicides the ababuist on my Corathan. <br>
<br>
The next four turns continues as I steal a creature/relic and Hunter Jile him every turn until I get set up. I quickly break through the Dark Twins, and he reveals Warrada.<br>
<br>
He uses Essence of Naroom to steal a 6 energy River Abaquist I&#39;d used to defeat the Twins. He boot&#39;s out a Corathan to kill my 3 energy Sea Barl. Leaving me a 1 energy Corathan.<br>
<br>
On my turn, I take back my Abaquist with the Karak Necklace, play Ring of Secrets followed by several other relics to pump up my Corathan. I attack and kill his only creature with my Abaquist, and attack and defeat his last Magi with the Corathan.<br>
<br>
We shake hands, and we wish each other luck. Roy asks to look at my deck, and I smile and hand it to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
5th Round:<br>
<br>
Dr. Bob and I are both undefeated at this point. We decided to draw, seeing as how the game would end as such anyways. The deck cannot beat itself in the mirror match up, nor can it win. <br>
<br>
Final Four:<br>
<br>
I&#39;m paired up with an Arderial Deck I watched Robert beat earlier. Blaire says he might as well concede to me now, but he&#39;s gonna go through with it anyway.<br>
<br>
Robert is paired up with Ron&#39;s Bograth deck. Ron is the third link in Jerry&#39;s crew that came to Atlanta, and the previous year&#39;s World Champion. <br>
<br>
Robert is a little concerned about Bograth, but I assure him it is an easy match up because all his guys are small and easy to steal, but to watch out for his last Magi, Obgren, who will use his effect to let Ron use his Athik&#39;s Smite against Dr. Bob&#39;s Orothe Magi.<br>
<br>
<br>
My opponent is playing a Delia/Shimmer/Aula deck.<br>
<br>
Arderial is my hardest matchup because of the Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
I take a deep breathe and roll. 12! The Gaming Gods smiled upon me. Blaire rolls a 4 :P<br>
<br>
I go first, and Conjure out a Bubble Xyx. I draw 3 cards. I play another Bubble Xyx, and draw 3 more cards. I end my turn and draw 2 more. <br>
<br>
Blaire drops a ton of Vellups and an Orish. He uses Hypnotize and pulls a Submerge from my hand. I sigh in relief. <br>
<br>
On my turn, I Conjure a Sea Barl, attack with my 2 weak creatures to weaken his 2 6 energy Elder Vellups, then Implosion my 1 energy Sea Barl to suicide. I draw 2 cards and say &quot;Go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blaire plays it safe, and plays a Abawyn&#39;s Quill and Relic Stalker (to help against Storm of Fishes, and possibly to prevent an Ormagon). He uses Hypnotize, and I discard Cimbing Staff to cancel it. He says &quot;Go&quot;.<br>
<br>
I energize and get my starting cards. I look at my hand, and notice the Hubdra&#39;s Cube and Forgotten Dancer in my hand. I see his Quill with lusty eyes ;p<br>
<br>
I play my Karak Relics and my Cube and steal his Quill. I draw Hunter Jile and a 2nd River Abaquist.<br>
<br>
I play Forgotten Dancer and steal/kill one of his Vellups. <br>
I play out 2 River Abaquist, 1 Abaquist, and the Hunter Jile. He say&#39;s &quot;Uh, oh....&quot; I steal all but 2 of his guys with River Abaquist, and discard the Hunter Jile, changing Core to Arderial with the Quill... Blaire says, &quot;It&#39;s not worth it for me to continue this match. You&#39;ve got me now, and it&#39;d be a waste of our time for me to try and recover.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blaire scoops his cards, and shakes my hand, and congratulates me.<br>
<br>
I watch Dr. Bob&#39;s match and smile. Ron reveals Obgren. He kills Bob&#39;s 2 creatures, then plays 2 Ahthik&#39;s. Ron uses the first Smite, and Bob Climbing Staff&#39;s it. Ron uses the second Smite, only to see another Climbing Staff. Ron frowns and says &quot;Go.&quot; ;(<br>
<br>
Bob plays Tidal Wave, and Warrior&#39;s Boots in a creature to finish off Ron&#39;s last Magi. They shake hands, and Ron congratulates Bob.<br>
<br>
Bob and I decide to split the prize. I concede the match, but receive the 2 round bye for the World&#39;s Competition at Gencon. Bob receives the 1 round bye. He knew I&#39;m more likely to attend Gencon, and we both knew better than to spend the time to play the match. We came as a team, and we left as a team :)<br>
