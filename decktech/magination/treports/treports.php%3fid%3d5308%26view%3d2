When they asked if I would participate in a tournament, I was thrilled. A total of twelve players signed up.<br />
<br />
Special rules for the tournament required that at least one of our magi had to be from Elders Legacy, a fan created set of cards for gEngine. Traitors Reach previewed cards, although available for play on gEngine, were not allowed in this tournament. Tainted Glimpses, Shadowsfall, custom promos (more fan creations), Tony at Con, and Power of the Creators were also banned.<br />
<br />
Having previously built, and rebuilt, a Warrada, Simulacrum deck, I chose to run with the rebuilt version in this tournament. For a moment I debated to rebuild it a bit more and take out the Eebit Twins, another Elders Legacy card. In the end, I chose to go with the deck as it was. With Evus Bookworm in the deck as well, this gave my deck a total of three different Elders Legacy cards.<br />
<br />
Warrada, Simulacrum. Naroom magi. Starting Energy: 12. Energize: 6.<br />
Effect - Child of the Forest: Warrada, Simulacrum plays Forest creatures for one less energy ignoring regional penalty and restrictions.<br />
Effect - Shift: Warrada can play Core spells as if she was a Naroom Shadow Magi.<br />
<br />
Eebit Twins. Naroom creature. Starting Energy: 2.<br />
Effect - Twins: Once per turn, immediately after Eebit Twins is defeated, you may immediately play Eebit Twins from your discard pile paying all costs.<br />
<br />
Evus Bookworm. Naroom relic. Cost: 0.<br />
Power - Evus Plaything (1): Until the end of your turn, Evus Bookworm changes to a Creature. Add two energy when Evus Bookworm changes to a creature. Discard all energy when Evus Bookworm becomes a relic.<br />
Power - Chew, chew, chew (2): Discard Evus Bookworm to discard any copy of Tomes of the Great Library from play. This card may discard Tomes of the Great Library.<br />
<br />
For those who may not be familiar with any of Elders Legacy, the fan cards, those are the three cards I was using in my deck. I was starting with Tiller, who would setup Salafy. Salafy could then setup Warrada. There was three Forest Wudge and three Forest Jile in the deck to capitalize some on Warradas effect. Since hardly anything else in the deck had anything to do with Forest Hyren, that creature was left out to create a deck with some spells and powers though the real emphasis was on effects for adding energy. Furok and Warriors Boots were staples of the deck.<br />
<br />
Day One, February 14th<br />
<br />
I dont know really how many games of the tournament were played this day. My own day was spent with my wife celebrating Valentines Day. It seems that at least one of the games crashed. The internet and computers are wonderful tools until something goes wrong. I feel sorry for them and worry a bit if this will happen to me. I have a few gEngine tokens to spare at the moment, so I think I will be okay should this happen to me.<br />
<br />
Day Two, February 15th<br />
<br />
Because of time zones and what not, although I played a game just a bit before midnight locally, it was actually a game played very early the next morning according to the gEngine clock.<br />
<br />
Day Three, February 16th<br />
<br />
Late the previous night, or early morning for some of you, I logged onto gEngine in hopes of seeing what was happening and getting in my first of the seven games I will need. Of course, I wouldnt be adverse to getting in a fun game or two as well. While tournaments can be fun from time to time, playing for fun tends to be fun most of the time. Looking at the forums for CCG Workshop, it looks like a small number of games have already been played in the first two days. I cant be sure since Ive never played in an online tournament like this before, but I am guessing that it might be a good start.<br />
<br />
After chatting online a bit about hand protection for a Naroom deck, I managed to get my first tournament game with [I]malovis.[/I] We did chat a little after the game as well. I mentioned that I had used Ahdar as a counter to the threat of local Tiller decks a while back. That was more in response to this game and my own use of Tiller for my tournament deck.<br />
<br />
[U]Game 1 of 7 vs. [I]malovis[/I][/U]<br />
<br />
I happened to go first and tossed down a good start with Tiller. With a Vortex of Knowledge played before my opponent flipped their first magi, I opted to risk mass destruction as I didnt know I was playing against Orothe quite yet. I play an Alpine Xamf and both Furoks. Quilla flipped and grabbed the Orothean Horn and Goggles as her two relics. This allowed [I]malovis[/I] to make sure she had a creature to summon with the horn, a Greater Garagnor. Tiller followed this up with a Tap Roots and sacrificed the now seven energy Furok attacking to beat up the opposing creature. It was finished off with the other Furok and the Alpine Xamf got in the free hit on Quilla. [I]Novelty[/I] had joined the game as an observer and made a comment about how its too bad that Sinders Mantle cannot be played by Naroom magi. I probably wouldve played things differently if not for that, however a Forest Jile provided a quick answer to the comment and ended up keeping things fierce for several turns. [I]Malovis[/I] used three copies of Tidal Wave during the game. The first took out Alpine Xamf and one other creature. The second was played with Shapers Apprentice and took out a Giant Carillion and another of my creatures. The alternate version of Oqua played the third one to wipe out two of my three creatures. Oqua also used her power to play an Eebit from my deck. This was followed this with the Algae Band to add one energy to the Eebit and ended the turn. If it wasnt for Warriors Boots, the game couldve easily gone a few more turns at that point. As it was, a single Alpine Xamf was big enough to take the Eebit and left the Weebo to attack Oqua for the win. Since we are allowed to make changes to our decks, [I]malovis[/I] vowed that the next game would use a more broken deck. Tiller went the distance against all three magi which is what led to the little discussion of how powerful he is.<br />
<br />
Day Four, February 17th<br />
<br />
Once again I logged in late at night. I missed [I]Glowing Hyren [/I]who was looking for a tournament game. I dont know by how much, but the post was still in the chat room where I could read it. However, gEngine was acting up terribly. I wasnt even sure it would be stable during a game since it was taking what seemed so incredibly long to just load up Magi-Nation. I chose after rebooting the engine a few times to go to bed and try in the morning.<br />
<br />
Day Five, February 18th<br />
<br />
Early in the morning before work, I logged into gEngine. Things loaded a lot smoother. I had the opportunity to chat with [I]Novelty[/I] for a while, but I didnt find anyone else from the tournament. With only ten more days to try and get six more games in, I am feeling a little desperate. However, we didnt chat about that much. [I]Novelty[/I] and I shared a little discussion on the future of Magi-Nation. It seems a bit bleak right now.<br />
<br />
After work and spending the evening with my wife, I chose to stay up a bit later and try once again to get in my second game for this tournament. As luck would have it, there was two players signed up for the tournament online. [I]CapAp[/I] asked if I was up for a tournament game. I created the game, and the random turn selection had me going first once again.<br />
<br />
[U]Game 2 of 7 vs. [I]CapAp[/I][/U]<br />
<br />
Tiller started out with the usual strong card draw, although I ended up with two copies of Warriors Boots and one copy of Evus Bookworm. This left me with Forest Jile, Weebo, Eebit, and Eebit Twins to work with for creatures. I played both eebits knowing I had Bythans Gift to work with. [I]CapAp[/I] flipped over Koza and started into Tiller real fast. They played a Hailstorm Pendant to eliminate Eebit. This was followed with Robe of the Ages and two spells, Crushing Ice and Spirit Drain. Combined with Kozas effect, this eliminated all my creatures and energy on Tiller. This left me without an ideal setup for Salafy. Tiller had been defeated much too quickly. However, Salafy gave me one Furok to work with in her starting cards. With both Warriors Boots, I placed out the Furok and the Forest Jile. This eliminated Koza, and I used the power of the jile to boost things a bit going into the next magi. Halsted flipped and [I]CapAp[/I] used Crystalize on the Furok. A Rayjes Belt locked down the power of the jile. Paying the penalty from Halsted to play Evus Bookworm, combined with Bythans Gift, left a twelve energy jile to hit an undefended Halsted. Tossing down the Weebo and Fird, I hoped to create a better offensive in the next turn. [I]CapAp[/I] wasnt experiencing a very good card draw, so they played Beam of Light on my Weebo and Crystalize to draw a card. With Furok now free to attack, Halsted was defeated on my next turn with only the Fird and Furok. I played out a Giant Carillion and then used the power of the Forest Jile. Followed up with Orwins Ring, things were looking very good for Salafy. Shortly after [I]CapAp[/I] flipped over Trellis the White, they declared, gg. We had an observer in this game who apparently had stepped away for a moment to get cookies and found the game done by the time he returned to his computer. It was a quick game.<br />
<br />
Win or lose, at this point, I still have five more games I must play in order to even qualify as completing the tournament. With at least four games under his belt at this time, [I]CapAp[/I] is actually the closest to qualifying. The next closest is [I]mikula[/I] and [I]malovis[/I] with two games each, as well as myself at this point. I think [I]Glowing Hyren [/I]is also at two games with one of them not added to the stats yet.<br />
<br />
Day Six, February 19th<br />
<br />
I didnt log onto gEngine until late in the evening. There was a tournament game running while I was there which I chose not to observe. I was really tempted to, but I thought it best if I just wait since one of the players was someone I hoped to play a game with. Once the game was over, I had the opportunity to play [I]ZaCkO.[/I] While it was still before midnight local time, it was just a little past according to gEngine.<br />
<br />
Day Seven, February 20th<br />
<br />
[U]Game 3 of 7 vs. [I]ZaCkO[/I][/U]<br />
<br />
[I]ZaCkO[/I] got to go first. Delia tossed down a vellup swarm and started fetching the Flying Hinkos with Elder Vellup. This powerful start with Delia can be a tough nut to crack. I flipped over Tiller and used his Vortex of Knowledge. After discarding Weeblit to his power for more card draw, I was able to come up with a Warriors Boots and Alpine Xamf. I took out one Vellup with that attack and then tossed down a Forest Jile and a small swarm of my own, including the Weebo. Weebo restored the xamf before the jile boosted it up a bit. With Orwins Ring used to make the whole thing a powerful start, it would take both the Elder Vellup and one of its smaller cousins to eliminate the xamf. Lightning and another Vellup got the Forest Jile. With some more card draw, Tiller replaced the losses. Knowing that I would need a good setup once I got past Delia, I admit that I kept the pressure on without going in for the kill. Once something simple was setup, I made the kill and played out an impressive swarm of creatures. This was meant to bait a Cataclysm. The swarm was fairly solid in its build, so failing to Cataclysm could be devastating. Sorreah flipped and fetched that Cataclysm. Tiller was defeated. When I flipped over Salafy, I tossed out a Robe of Vines. This small one energy per creature allowed me to create an impressive opening swarm. Sorreah had too little energy left to threaten with another Cataclysm, so I played everything out I could. Without Salafys effect, I was forced to watch some creatures disappear into the discard pile while fighting to get through to Sorreah. [I]ZaCkO[/I] played two Cloud Orshaa on two separate occasions. One of those, they ditched a Cataclysm too. It would turn out that they would later regret this. By the time Salafy got through Sorreah, the hand was beginning to be adequately replenished with creatures that I could use with Warrada, Simulacrum. I repeated the move with Tiller and set out another impressive swarm of Naroom goodness. Relaura did toss down an impressive Xyx Minor and Flying Hinko combo. With no Shooting Star or Lightning left in their hand, one of the Xyx Minor failed to survive using its power. Technically, now that I think of it, when I used Bythans Gift on my next turn, [I]ZaCkO[/I] shouldve added three more energy to his magi. However, things were going desperately downhill for them. I attacked and destroyed all three hinkos and both xyx losing only a few creatures. Both Furoks remained in play for another round of attacks. With Bythans Gift on my next turn and a Giant Carillion in play, it was possible to attack both Orathan Flyers and make the final blow to Relaura. [I]Novelty[/I] showed up as an observer on the end of that game. A good game by [I]ZaCkO.[/I] I am really gaining some respect for those Forest Jiles.<br />
<br />
I am excited. Only four more games to go. I might finish this in time. What is even more exciting is having some of those who are losing a lot express that they are still having fun. That is very important. Fun is very good. I believe it was [I]malovis [/I]who was playing another one of his games at the same time that made this comment afterwards. He played against [I]mikula,[/I] who apparently took one of his tournament decks and dropped the last magi to put on the required Elders Legacy magi. Thats a bit different than my deck that tries to setup something for my last magi.<br />
<br />
After actually going to sleep and waking refreshed for Sunday, I spent much of the day at Church and making a pancake dinner for my in-laws. I grew up with whole wheat pancakes and I have my own wheat grinder. It was a very good meal and I enjoyed preparing it.<br />
<br />
In the evening, I logged back onto gEngine to try and get that much closer to the required seven games. [I]Mikula[/I] logged on, as well as [I]CapAp[/I] and [I]ZaCkO.[/I] After a little discussion in the chat room where I mentioned that I am not so afraid of losing, but that I was willing to admit some fear and trepidation about playing the only other player still undefeated, [I]mikula[/I] and I played a game. It was guaranteed to end the winning streak for one of us. I have already played [I]CapAp[/I] and [I]ZaCkO.[/I] With [I]mikulas[/I] okay, the two of them observed the game.<br />
<br />
[U]Game 4 of 7 vs. [I]mikula[/I][/U]<br />
<br />
[I]Mikula[/I] got the first turn. With Sorreah, Tradewinds and Shooting Star were pulled as starters. Beam of Light was ditched to Tradewinds and [I]mikula[/I] played out an Orish and an Elder Vellup. Instead of grabbing all of Tillers starters, I chose to go with only the Vortex of Knowledge. This card draw allowed me to toss down a powerful opening with several creatures. An Alpine Xamf and Orwins Ring combo easily makes for a great start. Although tossing out strong like this risked leaving things really desperate for Salafy should they find a way to easily deal with it quickly, after stomping the Orish with a Giant Carillion, it turned out to be a great opening move. I didnt have any creatures in the hand until after I drew my two cards. Tiller would continue his uphill struggle against Sorreah for a few turns. After he made the final blow, I was able to start drawing cards with his powers. Arderian Adept showed up and I began seeing Vulbor make an appearance. I took the four energy loss on my Giant Carillion since it wouldnt discard the carillion outright and I had a Bythans Gift in my hand. With the Storm Shield for massive energy gain, I used Bythans Gift and Tap Roots on my next turn. I had a Robe of Vines in play at this point since [I]mikula[/I] had taken out my Alpine Xamf immediately on their second turn. With another stomping and the Tap Roots before my attack step, I made one mistake. I shouldve finished off the Aerial Flist by attacking with the Giant Carillion before playing the Weebo to heal it back up again. Oh well, live and learn. It didnt cost me the game. With a Shrink and a return of the Vulbor that had been undreamed before, I was left with a one energy Giant Carillion again which was then undreamed with Arderian Adept. This was followed with Crushing Roots on the regrown Aerial Flist and the Weebo attacked the Vulbor to defeat the adept. With the three remaining energy on Tiller, I played out a Forest Wudge which ended up with five energy after I drew my two cards. Relaura was then flipped over and [I]mikula[/I] played Crushing Winds on the Weebo. Warriors Boots and a Sandstorm Orshaa then took out a six energy wudge. This defeated Tiller. An Orish and another Sandstorm Orshaa was played. After I had to discard a random card from my hand, Salafy actually had a decent hand going into the mess. For once I actually used the creature I can create with Evus Bookworm. With two creatures with two energy and one fully healthy orshaa, the Bookworm attacked to eliminate one creature. Salafy then tossed down a Furok and a Giant Carillion. Tap Roots took the other two energy creature, and stomp left me with two four energy creatures in opposition to a clean battlefield. Warriors Boots remained a good friend of mikula and Elder Vellup took out the Giant Carillion. It would be the Flutter Yup that would decide my next turn. Furok took what little remained of the Elder Vellup and a small swarm of creatures was played out. The key element was playing a Fird, which I knew would still be small enough to hurt a Flutter Yup even after Orwins Ring boosted things. [I]Mikula[/I] played Hand of the Sky, but I had no spells left in my hand at this point. A Crushing Winds did get one creature, but it was basically game at this point. Fird attacked on my next turn, and I still had couple creatures to spare to go after any energy Relaura might have had. I think it was a good game.<br />
<br />
I had to write this game report tonight. If I waited too long, I would confuse it easily with the other game I played against Arderial. After the game we chatted a for a little bit. It was then that I realized that there are only seven active players of the twelve that signed up for this tournament. That means only six games each unless we are allowed to play a previous opponent again. Will any of us qualify in the end? I will have to post in the forum for the tournament asking about the situation. The seven of us that are active have made some modest progress and will probably have little trouble getting the six games we can before time is up. At least, I hope so. This has been fun so far. And, I am not referring to the number of wins I have so far. It is nice to be able to log on and have a decent chance at a game. Plus, I have the chance to chat with some players I had previously not known too well. I suppose I really dont know them too well as of yet, but I can hope there are future events to create interaction like this.<br />
<br />
Before I would go to bed, I logged back onto gEngine to do some conversions on my actual physical decks. I wanted to recreate some of my restricted-type decks that I have built and played with on gEngine. As I was on, I ended up in a bit of a discussion on Shadow Geyser decks. While the win with Awakening is very difficult to pull off, I asserted that it was possible if the deck merely used the geysers to compliment itself instead of relying upon that method for the win. We ended up playing a quick game. I took my restricted Weave against a Dark Twins Shadow Geyser deck. With much of their deck being the geysers in an attempt to make a run for the special win condition, Ahdar swept the twins. While they continued to assert that Shadow Geysers werent really viable as a deck, I made a personal note that I really ought to convert my past Shadow Geyser deck into gEngine. It was built back during Dreams End and I kept a record of the deck build. I am sure it will need some serious revamping, but the deck only used one copy of each geyser and one copy of Awakening. I recall coming very close to the special condition win but never bothering with it since the deck could win by normal means using the geysers to accelerate and empower the deck.<br />
<br />
Quite the day. Two tournament games and one game for the fun of it. Even if one of the two games was sort of from the previous day. Staying up late can make things a little confusing that way sometimes.<br />
<br />
Day Eight, February 21st<br />
<br />
Nothing eventful happened this day. Technically, I think that fun game I mentioned really happened early this morning before I went to bed. Once again, staying up late. That is getting to be quite a habit for me at times. I often find it easier to stay up then I do getting up.<br />
<br />
[I]Novelty[/I] responded on the forums to my question about the inactive players. It looks like my best hope is to send them private messages on the forums, or emails, and hope that they come play. I really do hope they do.<br />
<br />
I checked on gEngine in the evening to see if I could pick up another tournament game. No such luck. While I was on gEngine, I did finish the conversion of my Orothe, Paradwyn, and Naroom decks to restricted decks. Weave had been rebuilt previously, so that makes for four of my twelve physical game decks now fitting within restricted. This did require that I rebuild my Arderial and Bograth decks as well. Hurricane Orish and Fog Hyren were both taken out of those respective decks to complete the restricted ones for Orothe and Paradwyn.<br />
<br />
Day Nine, February 22nd<br />
<br />
Today, I went to Century Magic. This is the local store where Magi-Nation was once quite popular. Not anymore, but I figured I would show up anyways. Be seen. Let them know I still play. All that sort of stuff. I took with me Magic the Gathering, Magi-Nation, Star Wars, and my Warhammer 40k army. There was only a very few people in the store.<br />
<br />
Instead of playing any of the games I was prepared with, I ended up buying and exchanging two booster packs of Pokemon to get a deck built out of commons and uncommons from one of the three players that were there for that game. While they were excited about teaching me to play, and getting in a couple games, I dont think they realized that the deck they built for me and the two booster packs I bought for myself is probably all the Pokemon I will probably collect. This means I will have at least three or four games with very small card collections, and Star Wars is one of them.<br />
<br />
So, I really didnt do anything with the tournament this day.<br />
<br />
Day Ten, February 23rd<br />
<br />
I posted on the CCG Workshop forums that I have this Friday off from work. Perhaps, just perhaps, I can pick up another game or two. It looks like no tournament games have happened the past couple days, and not just for myself. In addition, I did send some private messages on the forum to the five players that are still missing from the scene.<br />
<br />
With no real game activity going on in the tournament, I edited an article I had written a while back and posted on DeckTech. Once I finished editing, the article was posted to Noveltys Custom Cards Forums. It was about playing what I call A Reversed Weave. I never did really master defensive Weave other than how to beat it, so I ended up learning how to play a very aggressive Weave that attacks instead of defending. The article was my attempt to show others how to play it. It seems that Novelty tried it out and ended up swarming.<br />
<br />
Day Eleven, February 24th<br />
<br />
Although I havent been able to pick up any more of the tournament games for the past few days, this Thursday was already scheduled for other activities. After work and dinner, my wife and I went to a business development seminar. That lasted until eleven oclock. The speaker was excited and the presentation went an hour over schedule. I stayed up a little later than she did, but not by a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Day Twelve, February 25th<br />
<br />
When I checked the forums this morning, I found that my articles on building swarms and the aggressive Weave decks had been added to the CCG Workshop articles. [I]Novelty[/I] had left a message to that effect. I almost missed them on the front page of the CCG website. Of course, then I checked to see if they could be accessed elsewhere, such as the game listings.<br />
<br />
Throughout the day I occasionally checked into gEngine. On one occasion, I picked up a non-tournament game against [I]Gar.[/I] Theyre not a part of the tournament and I used my restricted Paradwyn deck. An opening with Vine Hyren and Fog Hyren gave my deck a good start. The Vine Hyren would last about eight turns or so. The whole game was about twenty turns, counting each players turn. An early card draw of plenty of relics but a bit sparse on creatures and spells left Gars deck struggling to challenge Paradwyn mass energy tactics. A very good game. Gar made some real good moves with what was available in that game.<br />
<br />
While I did see the name listed for one of the people I still need to play, they were in a game of Elemental. Getting a bit more tired than I anticipated, I decided to call it a night despite the fact that I didnt get in any tournament games.<br />
<br />
Day Thirteen, February 26th<br />
<br />
In the morning I logged onto gEngine on several different occasions. Once again, I was unable to pick up another tournament game. This did not stop me from playing a casual game. My opponent started with Magam and then had Magam, Flamesmith as their second magi. This was pointed out by an observer who joined the game later. I responded that I knew their deck wasnt legal, but I was playing for fun and didnt really mind too much. As it was, Arderial-Orothe devastated the Cald deck. I had to turn off the auto-energize though. I was forgetting to add energy to the Orathan Flyers. Auto-energize only takes care of the magi and I was forgetting my creatures. On the fun side of things, I was using a Storm of Fishes deck that is often just messed up in how it works. A challenging deck to play with. He used lots and lots of creatures, so there wasnt much to get with Storm of Fishes. I did gain a little more respect for Magams Ring though. I am not sure if Ill use it in my Cald decks yet. My Cald decks tend to burn out their creatures faster than they are discarded on an opponents turn.<br />
<br />
Day Fourteen, February 27th<br />
<br />
The tournament is nearly over. It looks like I am going to fall way short of the seven games I needed to qualify. Four games is still better than none. I was really hoping that some of the inactive players would jump in perhaps. As things stand, no one will actually win. Though, it seems there might be a consolation prize of a smaller number of copper tokens for the person with the most games. That will not be me. I am certain of that. I dont think I can pick up the three more games to qualify.<br />
<br />
By the end of the day I saw that a report what seems to be [I]maloviss[/I] seventh game. I guess [I]UltraDoug[/I] finally came out to play. I am glad. Unless someone else gets in their seventh game, [I]malovis[/I] has a sure thing. So far, only [I]CapAp[/I] has six games, so if [I]CapAp[/I] can get in a seventh game and win then it might be a tie. Ill have to check tomorrow after work. It will be too late to get in a game myself then since I close the store this Monday and wont get home in time.<br />
<br />
While I did see [I]Glowing Hyren [/I]online while I was on gEngine, I ended up getting in some fun games instead. The first of my two fun games today was a knock down between dResh and Underneath. Bulabantus served me well, as well as my third magi. In the end dResh lost by an Ormagon. Emaal was the second to last magi, so the final Underneath magi just tossed down the one big bad boy and that was game.<br />
<br />
My opponent in the first game for the day then invited me to play in a two on two. They were my ally while our opponents played a creatureless Nar and a Naroom deck. I tossed down an aggressive Weave deck. With Weave Seed and The Hunt, an undefended Nar magi was not too much of a threat. At the end, the Naroom player dropped when two Seaweed Lascinth under Kesia were going to tear into a nasty swarm they had tossed out with Yaki. The Hunt was going to ensure to almost all the major threats didnt survive past my turn. With only Ahdar defeated on our team, the Nar magi dropped out shortly after the Naroom. Granted playing Exposure didnt help his Naroom ally earlier in the game.<br />
<br />
Not a bad day in all, even if I didnt get in any tournament games. I wonder how I might do next month. If nothing else, I hope these continue. Oh, by the way, both the decks I used today were built using the limitations of restricted. Restricted isnt feeling as awful as I once thought it would be.<br />
<br />
Day Fifteen, February 28th<br />
<br />
News for a tournament in March has already been posted on the CCG Workshop forums. I stayed up late last night making some decks in the new format. For that tournament, we will be required to still have on Elders Legacy magi in our stack. Traitors Reach is legal, and one of our magi must not share any regions with any of our other magi. So, two purely Arderial and one purely Orothe magi is legal, while mixing any Arderial/Orothe magi (dual-region magi) in that same stack would make it illegal. Quite an interesting rule. It has got me excited. I drafted about five decks late Sunday night, early Monday morning before going to bed. After getting up, I logged for a bit to check over my decks and make some edits.<br />
<br />
The majority of my day was spent doing laundry and working in the evening. By the time I got home, it was practically midnight. The tournament finished with [I]malovis[/I] as the uncontested winner. Way to go [I]malovis![/I]<br />
<br />
[I]Malovis[/I] was actually online this evening, and we started a game to test out some decks for this next tournament. Things werent going too well for my deck, but about the time I tossed out a good swarm with my second magi in a small hope of recovering is when my gatling Engine crashed on this computer. That hasnt happened too often to me. I signed up for the March tournament before finishing up this report.<br />
