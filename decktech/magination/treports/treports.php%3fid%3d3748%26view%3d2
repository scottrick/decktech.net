# of people:18<br>
Format: Constructed<br>
Rounds: 4(I wi would have been 5 and a final 4)<br>
Side Note: From now on all Tournaments there will start at 5:30 instead of 6:30 to try and allow for that extra round.<br>
<br>
Round 1: Bograth(Baa, Blygt, Emlob) played by Ed Swing<br>
This is the most intense game I have played in Magi-Nation ever.  Upon hearing the pairings I had a bad feeling that this would mean I was out of the running for first, because out of all the other decks, this is one of the very few I had lost to.  While in the end the game did result in a tie, it was not because we took long turns.  Quite the opposite, each turn lasted an average of 30 seconds, we just traded creatures back and forth.  He would average playing about 3-4 creatures a turn discarding one for some benefit and I would average playing 1-2 a turn but they stayed in play longer and attacked to take out the Bograth swarms before they could ever make a solid showing.  We had played this battle during a previous night and he had won it, but with the knowledge from our previous battle I knew not to take out Blygt until I had the proper cards for Pruitt to beat him, and he knew not to take out Trynn until he had the proper cards for Blygt.  During the course of the game, he passed up on chance to get rid of Trynn in the third Turn, and I passed up one chance to get rid of Baa in the twentieth or so turn.  After that I decided to not hold back cards for Pruitt(I had 2 Ormagons and 2 Rayjes Belts in my hand, but never got held onto enough energy to play the Ormagon) I played my Nightmare Channel on Baa and manage to knock him out.  Ed brought in Blygt and I was preparing to lose Pruitt when time was called.  With both of us no where near defeated(but me with a perfect hand to do so) we declared a match a tie as there was no way there would be a decision in the next 5 turns(best case scenario he would flip over Emlob and I would still be on Pruitt unable to second Ormagon).  With one tie and hope that with enough time a fifth round could still put me into first place I held my head up high and went on to the next battle.  This deck was by far the best Bograth deck I had ever seen and I was sure he would also go on to not lose any more battles.  I was later surprised to find out that Ed took a loss to a very well built Paradwyn deck(much props to Andrew Mackiezie for continued improvement), but with a starting Iain(who cleans house against virtually every other region except Naroom and Bograth), I just couldnt understand how Bograth fell.<br>
<br>
Round 2: Orothe(O&#39;qua, Orlon, Arosa) played by David Bourdon <br>
Steal and Steal and Steal.  This deck had no discard, but instead packed 3 River Abaquists, 3 Abaquist, 3 Curse of the Abaquist, and 3 Crushing Surf.  Also included was Karaks and Hubdras Cube.  To add to the fun it also had a Corathan and the Karak Jewelery.  At this point I was thanking the gaming gods for the very needed errata on those cards.  Even with the errata this deck was a machine.  Oqua got a lucky double submerge draw that allowed her to take my first turn 7 energy Granas(he didnt have an Orothean Belt).  That one move cost me about 4 turns, because whenever I played something small to knock 2 energy off at a time he would Crushing Surf it and then also steal one of my relics.  His relics would then let him draw more cards and get more energy.  I quickly learned to stop play my relics, and not drawing a Rayjes Belt didnt help at all either. I beat this deck earlier in the week, so I realized I with no discard I just had to keep my creatures big.  Dave was taking pretty slow turns and a few times he was playing the cards completely wrong, but I informed him of the correct way they worked before any harm was done.  Two of the bigger examples I remember are he tried to discard a Granas of mine he stole to steal my other Granas with a Curse of the Abaquist.  He didnt understand why I was telling him he cant do that until I showed him that Curse specifically says you may only discard a Paradwyn of Orothe Creature from play to do so.  The other big thing he tried to do was use the River Abaquist when he had 4 relics and 6 creatures to steal a 7 energy creature.  I nicely told him that when the RA says creatures OR relics, you choose one card type(relics 4 OR creatures 6) and count those, not count both(creatures or relics 10).  In the end this game ran out of time with Orlon about to be hit with Pruitts incoming Ormagon and me with a Rayjes Belt in hand.  I didnt have any Warriors boots, so the Vinoc and Carillion would have to wait a turn or also suffer the Devastate of the Ormagon.  With this being my second tie and there definitely only being 4 rounds I knew I was out of the running.  If I hadnt have Nightmare Channeled Oqua first turn, Dave would have beat me earlier, but on that same token if he would have drawn an extra Submerge in his opening hand he would have lost within the time limit.<br>
<br>
Round 3: Cald(Gar, Grega, Barak)played by Jordan King <br>
<br>
This match stared off pretty bad since I got a Braggle in my starting hand.  I felt bad because he was a younger player, but I let him take his time and was apologetic on each of my turns.  I went first and played an Eebit and a Grow.  He Fireballed and Thermal Blasted it and played a Lava Balamant.  I then played the Braggle and kept throwing energy onto it for the next 2 rounds.  After the Braggle got to 10 energy, with help of a Tap Roots, I played a Granas and a Flutter Yup.  Gar got beat by the power of the Braggle.  With the Braggle in play and knowing my opponent was Cald, I just threw as much energy into it as I could, and with that Grega and Barak both fell the same round they came into play.<br>
<br>
Round 4: Core(Lanyx, Ogar, Harror)played by Aaron Stroud<br>
<br>
This Core decks main strength was Lanyx.  Not only did it include Cald creatures, but Cald relics as well.  That isnt necessarily a bad thing, but when you have cards that your second and third Magi cant play you are just holding yourself back.  Well I won the die roll and opted to go first.  I flipped Trynn got a grow, and then drew 3 more cards.  I got a Vinoc, Braggle, Warriors Boots and a Flutter Yup.  Not knowing yet what I would face, I played the Vinoc and Refreshed it.  Taking a gamble I also cast the grow with a 5 and added that energy to the Vinoc as well.  I drew my 2 cards and got another Flutter Yup and a Nightmare Channel.  When Lanyx came in, the first move was to Harvest the Vinoc.  After that he played a Silth Giant and ended his turn.  With a Cald creature in play my turn was fairly obvious.  I Booted in the Braggle and then attacked the Silth Giant down to 6 and then played my 2 Flutter Yups and Nightmare Channeled one and Refreshed the other.  This time I drew a Energy Band and an Umm..No.  At this point Lanyx was as good as defeated because he only had 6 energy to work with and a Cald Creature that would only be useful if he used Harvest(4 energy creature attacking a Flutter Yup loses three and the Yup laughs it off, and Cald vs Braggle is the same thing).  So he tried to use a Shadow bones on the Giant, but then he realized SB only works on Core creatures.  He didnt attack and ended up Harvesting the Braggle.  I played the Energy Band and added 2 to one Yup and used Trynns refresh to add 2 to the other.  The Five energy Yup attacked and the Giant went down to one so my second Yup lost one energy when it defeated the Giant.  This time I drew a Granas and a Tomorrows Jewel.  Lanyx energized to 3 because of the Nightmare channel and then drew his 2 cards.  The Yups overwhelmed him and then Ogar and Harror fell in quick succession.  After Ogar fell, I had 5 creatures in play.  2 Eebits, a Granas, a Flutter Yup still, and a Braggle.  Aaron flipped over Harror and got a Cataclysm, but I held onto an Umm..No and saved my Granas, because he would be burrowed against the incoming Dark Ayebaw.  He played it and discarded all the energy from my Magi, and I ended up winning the game with Trynn by attacking with my Granas.  That made 2 games in a row where I wasnt even close to flipping over my second Magi.  Part of the reason was because with the 2 previous Ties, I was playing down(people with losses) instead of up(people with wins).<br>
<br>
In the end Chris Slye won the Tournament with his powerful Underneath deck.  While his deck is unquestionably worthy of winning a tournament, he definitely benefited from the bad luck that Dave and Ed had in having to face me in the first 2 rounds.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Slops: <br>
Ed Swing for putting up such an incredible fight.<br>
David Bourdon for taking so long with his turns.<br>
The computer.  The last 2 tournaments have randomly seeded me against the best decks first.  I have a saying that if you have any loses you really can&#39;t complain about what place you get.  Well, I didn&#39;t lose, so with only 4 rounds and 2 draws, I can honestly say I really got screwed.  My deck has only lost to 3 people after 50+ games(it has been changed to take those losses into account) and I didn&#39;t even get a chance to play either of them (Nathaniel Wise wasn&#39;t there, but Harry and Chris were the last 2 people playing with 3 and 0 records at the end).  Essentially, David and I both lost out at a chance of winning because the computer paired us up early.  If we would have had this draw in round 4 I would have been at least a little satisfied.<br>
