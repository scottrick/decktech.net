4-19-2003<br />
<br />
The tournament at Century Magic the Saturday before was postponed&#8211;not enough players with decks/entry fee. Because of the delay (I worked that evening), it gave me the opportunity to participate this Saturday. So, I can&#8217;t really complain. My sister was visiting, so I nearly didn&#8217;t go. As it was, she agreed to come with me.<br />
<br />
Cameron and Jason were waiting for more players when I got there. Jason normally is the Tournament Director, but he&#8217;s been easing off to focus on finals. The store owner is also registered, so the store was running this one. In other words, it was a great opportunity for Jason to participate. When Garrett was told that all we needed was one more to have a tournament, he was interested in playing and asked us to wait for him to put his deck together&#8211;I am not sure why he had taken it apart.<br />
<br />
The first pairings had been assigned when RJ asked if it was too late to join the tournament. This brought us up to an odd number of players, and RJ was given the first &quot;bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
I chose to use my Weave/Core deck and signed up for the League as well, with the hopes of getting a little further on the Core Season. Jason played his Cald hyren deck&#8211;Monarch, Volcano, Ember, and Magma at least from what I saw. Cameron burrowed Adam Bates&#8217;s (store employee) Weave deck, an aggressive deck with Drought and Aritex. Garrett put together a Bograth deck with Obgren and Choas Flugg combo on the end. RJ played an Underneath deck with Gyrg, Striped Korrit and Will of Orothe.<br />
<br />
First Round<br />
<br />
My first opponent was Garrett with his Bograth deck. I went first, and started with Empress Gia and no starting cards. The creatures in my deck are mostly Weave, though I didn&#8217;t manage to be so lucky as to pull an Uwamar for a few turns. Still, drawing three cards each turn started the deck moving quickly. Plus, Drowl and Vuryip were both in the deck&#8211;playable by Weave Shadow Magi. Since I play an aggressive Weave deck, Weave Seed and Stealth tore into the Bograth deck not allowing much time to build up. His deck started with Gorran. It took a couple turns for the Weave deck to gain momentum, so Gorran lasted a few turns. Next, it was Rayje, an surprising addition. Instead of choosing to draw extra cards, he chose the defensive effect giving his creatures one energy when defending. With a Staff of Keepers, he was able to play out several Bograth creatures without trouble. Empress Gia was well into the swing of things, and Rayje fell beneath the onslaught. His last magi was Obgren. He played out a small swarm, but found that he was unable to play the Chaos Flugg because he didn&#8217;t have Gwaeg. Ouch! Obgren fell to Empress Gia and we spent the rest of our round waiting for Jason and Cameron to finish their game. Jason beat Cameron just a little before the buzzer.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Card draw with Empress Gia in a mostly Weave deck. Plus, Weave Hut protected the energy on my magi from Spirit Drain, something he nearly did&#8211;I let him take it back because he didn&#8217;t know all the &#8220;Hut&#8221; did while it was in play.<br />
Neg.<br />
No Gweag. That really hurt Garrett.<br />
<br />
Second Round.<br />
<br />
Jason took the &quot;bye&quot; this time and Cameron was my opponent. Cameron started with Ahdar and the Uwamar that he starts with. This gave Cameron a good start, and a creature it would take me several turns to get around. On the other hand, I managed to pull an Uwamar in my starting hand as well, in fact I had all three in play within about four of my turns. With his early wall, I played Agram&#8217;s Staff, since a Core card in play would allow my Uwamars to attack. While it cut down my card draw a little, the Uwamars stampeded over his first two magi. Cameron focused on destroying the Uwamars and had me down to only one after Empress Gia took out Ahdar and Kesia. Zaya finished on the end, but Uwamar wasn&#8217;t the only creature I had since I played Weave creatures as often as I could&#8211;nearly every turn. Zaya made a brief showing, and also went down to Empress Gia. There still was time left to wait as RJ and Garrett played, though Garrett was obviously hurting and commented afterwards that RJ had actually forced his creatures to attack in a devastating fashion using Will of Orothe and the Striped Korrit. Their game ended after Garrett left only one energy on his magi and destroyed all of RJ&#8217;s creatures using the Chaos Flugg. RJ responded in kind with an Ormagon and Resonate on his next turn.<br />
<br />
Pos.<br />
Three attacking Uwamars. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than that with Empress Gia, unless you add in Stealth and I did have that too.<br />
Neg.<br />
First, I admit that I should&#8217;ve defeated Kesia one turn earlier, but I forgot to attack with those vicious Uwamars. Second, Garrett leaving only one energy on his magi facing off against an Underneath deck that had sufficient energy to Ormagon with extra.<br />
<br />
Third Round.<br />
<br />
Instead of having me take the &quot;bye&quot; and perhaps have to play another round to settle first place, Eric (store employee) pulled out his Core deck and prepared to make me work for it. Now, like the deck Cameron was using, my deck also used Drought and Aritex. While this was a factor in how well Empress Gia did in the previous games, it didn&#8217;t really decide the game nearly as much as it did in this game against Eric. Empress Gia started off strong against Zet, using Weave Seed on a Seaweed Lascinth to attack one of his creatures and one of mine that he had turned. Being that big, he couldn&#8217;t turn it using Zet&#8217;s own power on his next turn and Zet went down to the monster with Reflexes. However, I probably shouldn&#8217;t have used the power of the Seaweed Lascinth when I defeated Zet. Though I knew his second magi was Warrada, I had forgotten that Essence of Naroom can take a Weave creature as well. As soon as the deed was done, I remembered. That same Seaweed Lascinth then took out Empress Gia, with help from the rest of his Core deck of course. Taisa stepped up as my second magi. The Seaweed Lascinth was slowing eating up my forces, but I found a chance to use the Aritex combo and still leave at least a creature in play to oppose it, as it was the only creature he had in play due to our constant battling. It ended up working out that with plenty of energy on my magi, he played Morag&#8217;s &#8220;Gift&#8221; and Corrupt with Warrada. Unfortunately, Warrada ended the turn with no energy. All I needed was for the Seaweed Lascinth to attack. So, I played Drought. During the next turn, Seaweed Lascinth destroyed my Uwamar, and the only creature I had in play. After using Sawgrass and defeating Warrada, I played out my Chaos Flugg plus a little extra and made sure Taisa had plenty of energy going into Ashio, his last magi. Ashio did manage to get a good position, except a couple turns and one Chaos Flugg later, Taisa finished the game. Note: Ashio was my third magi, too.<br />
<br />
Since RJ&#8217;s deck was really designed to abuse things in the attack step, Jason tore him apart with his Cald hyren deck using spells and powers. I got to see the end of that game, and RJ made a bit of a mistake on his last magi. Jason had been chipping away at a Pylofuf and had it down to one energy left. RJ played a few spells and ended his turn with no energy on his magi. Jason energized, and used the same Brushfire he had used the turn before from the discard pile to end the game. As for Cameron and Garrett, they went to time and it was a draw, though Garrett was on Obgren and had just destroyed all of Cameron&#8217;s Weave creatures using Obgren and Chaos Flugg.<br />

This has to go to Jason. Although he didn&#8217;t think his deck could keep up with my Weave deck, he played both his games quite well. Among the local players, he is still above average. Plus, he built a working hyren deck by focusing mostly on Cald. I thought his game was looking good.<br />

Now, I knew Eric used Warrada as his second magi, and that he used the Essence of Naroom. Forgetting what all the relic did until I had just defeated Zet wasn&#8217;t too bright. Just plain sloppy of me. It cost me precious time, and the control of the field.<br />

It was past eleven o&#8217;clock in the evening when the tournament finished. After saying my thanks for the good games (I thanked them after each game as well), my sister and I left. Her car was at my place, and she had to return to Provo, Utah. And, yes, although I beat both Garrett and Cameron fairly soundly, they did play well and were great sportsmen. Same goes for Eric.<br />
<br />
Well, that finishes my first tournament report. Long past time I wrote one of these.<br />
