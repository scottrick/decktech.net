<br>
THE PRECEDING ERRATA ARE ANNOUNCED 7/16/2<br>
THESE ERRATA ARE EFFECTIVE FOR SANCTIONED TOURNAMENT PLAY AS OF 8/1/2<br>
<br>
Here's some info on the needs for these changes.<br>
<br>
Ring of Secrets, Rayje's Construct, Shadow Vinoc, Inhibitor Band:<br>
These cards are often used to exploit the many zero-cost Relics in the game.<br>
Decks that favor Relics over other card types are great, but these cards<br>
allow those decks to follow non-interactive playstyles, which are not in the<br>
sprit of Magi-Nation.<br>
<br>
Undream Abilities:<br>
We all love free energy, but being able to turn that energy from a<br>
containable problem (like a single, huge creature) to an open-ended<br>
nightmare (a Magi with nearly limitless energy) is too powerful. Many decks<br>
use that limitless energy to enact locks and other non-interactive combos.<br>
<br>
Rayje:<br>
Wily allowed Rayje to select the most debilitating and restrictive Spells to<br>
use against his opponent every turn. Limiting his selection a bit contains<br>
this problem, while still allowing him several useful cards to choose from.<br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm:<br>
The dreaded 'Mydra Swarm Lock' deck has been discussed for a while now, and<br>
we're taking this opportunity to remove the deck from the tournament<br>
environment along with the other non-interactive deck archetypes. Mydra<br>
Swarm is now an effective tool to use against players who use card-drawing<br>
engines each turn.<br>
<br>
Furlosk:<br>
When you find a deadline only hours away and need to create a card for the<br>
print sheets, it's easy to make something that is absolutely not broken.<br>
It's also easy to go too far. This change makes Furlosk a bit more playable.<br>
<br>
Other Bograth Cards:<br>
Bograth's mighty card-drawing, energy-gaining engine worked far better then<br>
our designers and playtesters imagined, allowing players to draw into their<br>
entire deck and fund all of those cards relatively easily, and without a<br>
chance for the opponent to respond. These changes were made to bring Bograth<br>
down to an acceptable speed.<br>
<br>
Liriel's Cape:<br>
This wording matches the designer's intent of the card. A new proxy card<br>
image will be available at the Magi-Nation website shortly.<br>
<br>
Shell:<br>
What was intended to be used as a 'protect my stuff so I can make a<br>
comeback' card is being used as a 'protect my stuff to extend my advantage'<br>
card. This version prevents a player from dominating by protecting his cards<br>
every turn.<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Alan Sagan said on Thu Jul 25 2002 <br>holy crap that's alot of errata... that must have been ballsy of the creators.<hr>Matthew Ley said on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>Thank the Lord.  So many of those cards were very abusive.  They have good playtesters, but I swear that almost every card needs to say "once per turn".  <br>
<br>
A good group of errata, should make the tourney game more diverse.
