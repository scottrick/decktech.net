INTERACTIVE IMAGINATION® SIGNS DEAL TO BRING MAGI-NATION® ANIMATED SERIES TO<br>
TELEVISION<br>
<br>
Co-Venture with Keller Productions and Pastis Television International will<br>
Create Original Cartoon Series Based on Magi-Nation's Fantasy Premise<br>
<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, WA - June 26, 2002 - Interactive Imagination Corporation, a Seattle<br>
based entertainment development company, today announced that it has signed<br>
an agreement to create an animated television series based on its<br>
Magi-Nation franchise.  The project is a joint venture between Interactive<br>
Imagination and well-known children's programming producers Keller<br>
Productions and Pastis Television International.  Interactive Imagination<br>
and its co-production partners will develop and distribute a minimum of 26<br>
episodes, with the series expected to air in the US by Fall 2003.<br>
<br>
Based on an original franchise developed by Interactive Imagination,<br>
Magi-Nation is a unique and immersive universe filled with imaginative<br>
creatures, mystical spells and amazing journeys.  The series began with<br>
Magi-Nation Duel, a collectible card game that became an instant top 5<br>
best-seller, and has since grown with periodic releases of card game<br>
expansions and a popular video game for Nintendo Game Boy® Color.  The<br>
animated series continues the expansion of the franchise, which Interactive<br>
Imagination's multi-tiered marketing strategy will grow with card game<br>
expansions, additional video games, novels, toys, comic books, educational<br>
workbooks, Web sites and on-line games.<br>
<br>
"We created Magi-Nation as a premise designed to be accessible by fantasy<br>
fans of all ages, offering a concept that fills the void for those turned<br>
off by the childish nature or complex play found in other series," said Rich<br>
Silveira, CEO of Interactive Imagination.  "Magi-Nation incorporates the<br>
most successful components of the fantasy genre, and infuses distinct<br>
elements of Western mythology to create an exceptional and engrossing<br>
storyline."<br>
<br>
Magi-Nation is not just a story, it is an entire fantasy world filled with<br>
magic and adventure.  The Moonlands of Magi-Nation were created using the<br>
infinite powers of the mind and imagination.  The inhabitants of Magi-Nation<br>
can take their dreams and craft them into vast and fantastical realities,<br>
creating spectacular Dream Creatures and magical artifacts.  However, as is<br>
the balance in all places, there is a mighty struggle between good and evil,<br>
light and shadows.  The Magi-Nation animated series tells the tale of an<br>
ancient evil that has returned to conquer the peaceful Moonlands, and the<br>
young stranger who is thrust into the role of unwilling hero to help save<br>
the inhabitants of Magi-Nation.<br>
<br>
"Magi-Nation presents a wonderful backdrop for an animated series," said<br>
Eytan Keller of Keller Productions.  "The series will incorporate the<br>
stunning artwork created by Interactive Imagination's talented artists and<br>
expand on the unique premise developed by their creative team.  It has been<br>
a while since I've seen so compelling a property that has it all, from depth<br>
of story and strikingly memorable characters to a powerful visual style.  It<br>
's a privilege and a professional pleasure to have the opportunity to<br>
translate this vision into the world of animation."<br>
<br>

Keller Productions and Pastis Television International both have a history<br>
of success in developing and distributing children's television programming.<br>

All it needs is good voice work, and if they stay away from the mentality of formula that dominates kids shows (pokemon, sailor moon, scooby doo, inspector gadget, the same things happen every episode), this show could be really successful.<hr>Matthew Ley said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>I agree totally.  MND has a great story, with well planned, interesting, and fun characters.  Can't wait to see Zet and Korg on the small screen :)<hr>Brandon Fisher said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>I am really looking forward to this. As long as they follow the story line that already exists. I wouldn't want them to pick up were the story is now because then we wouldn't be able to see naroom before core messed it up. i also hope they don't get bad voice acting. <hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>Bad voice acting can really kill a show.  For example the lousy voice acting makes YuGiOh suck even worse than it already would.<hr>Michael Girard said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>Now let's just hope and pray they play the card game in the cartoon.  As a store operator, this will be a dream come true.  ;)<hr>Ryan Fojtik said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>ive always been semi interested in magination duel since its one of the few ccgs i havent played, mostly due to the fact that i know absolutely noone that plays it.. <br>
<br>
although it did look like the people who were doing it were having a damn lot of fun (since their tourneys always seem to be right next to the decipher ones at cons) .. <br>
<br>
im just gonna say this here cuz idunno where else to, but probly the coolest thing ever about large tourneys in a card game was how legend of the 5 rings world championships outcomes would affect the future expansions (ie, the clan's deck that won the tourney would be reflected as more powerful in the next expansion, and in the lore of the cards and stuff).. kinda provided an interesting dynamic where the players of the game were allowed to affect the game itself just by playing.. the whole point of saying this was that they could almost do something like that with the tv show (if they have actual creative control over content)... which imo, would be cool.. <hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>Ryan, they do have tournaments that affect the story, they are called, oddly enough, storyline tournaments.  They are a really big deal, actually, and are very interesting<hr>Law Sterling said on Thu Jul 11 2002 <br>Yes; the storylines affect the story, which means the fans will be affecting the series. Additionally, 2i takes card submissions from fans all of the time...Meaning you can have a more personal stamp on everything, especially if your Creatures become prominent in the show.<hr>Leef Brawlen said on Fri Jul 12 2002 <br>Voice acting and formula... the scourge of all animated series!!  I'm hoping we'll see something more along the lines of the first series or two of Gargoyles.  Lotsa story, no formula, no obviously planted morals slapping you in the face every episode reinforced by a hero monologue at the end spelling it out for you.  ... Here's hopin'.  =)  So it doesn't sound SO negative, I am looking forward to it.  I'm just hoping they don't ruin it.
