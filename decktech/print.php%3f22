<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>New DeckTech 2.0 with no banner ads! posted by DeckTech on Thu Jul 12 2001 <br>Some changes have been happening here at DeckTech. Most people will notice right away the new 'Tech Shop' link in the main navigation on every page. <br>
<br>
In the Tech Shop you can spend the extra Tech Points you have to increase the usability and enjoyability of your DeckTech experience. <br>
<br>
One of the new features allows you to disable all the rotating banners found at the top of every page by spending a few extra Tech Points.<br>
<br>
If you don't have enough Tech points, don't worry, you can buy some more and at the same time get a chance to win the monthly drawing where we give the best rares signed by the best playeers in the world.<br>

<hr>Deck said on Thu Jul 12 2001 <br>I have all the points i need except to get that damn email adress.  but then i go back to 0, thats no good i cant even rate!<hr>faramir said on Fri Jul 13 2001 <br>oh no, someone might spend a bunch of money to pay for the site so we don't have to and then they'd rule the world with their million tech points.  whatever would we do then?<hr>Rei said on Fri Jul 13 2001 <br>Buying points is gay, they should only be earn by merits, man decktech realy gets near the bottom everyday.<hr>K Radagast said on Fri Jul 13 2001 <br>Buying points? That's low...<hr>duo said on Fri Jul 13 2001 <br>This is the gayest thing that has ever happend to decktech. When I first joined it was a group of people talking about decks now it is an e-mail service and a card shop!!! I can go to hotmail and get free e-mail for free. to charge tech points!1 I only got about 2000. giving the guys who get 5 stars on every review because they are top ten is silly. This is a new low for decktech.<hr>Matt said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>I swear to god I get so #&!%ing tired of you crying bitches (like "duo" here, who doesn't even have the balls to put his real name)who expect to get everything handed to you on a goddamn silver platter. If you don't like it, then go the #&!% away. I like this site, I'm doing what I can to support it, because I don't expect Dave and Neal to slave away at this site for absolutely nothing. They've done that already for way too long. They've sacrificed enough, now it's time to help them out. So either buy some goddamn tickets or go the #&!% away. Either way, QUIT FUCKING CRYING. And for all of those people who realize this, and ARE helping out, and trying to support Neal and Dave, THANK YOU. I know they appreciate it. <hr>chicken soup said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>what the hell buy tech points. #&!% that shyte , u earn them. Hey wait im rich ill just buy more than hunter, oh wait i can. damn dt<hr>TheOne said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>Come on guys, 2 bucks per 250 points equals 10 bucks to get rid of the banners so those who can. . .or would like to support the site can pay 10 bucks a month to support this great site and dont have to be bothered by annoying banners. . .the other are just perks to try add something new...for the people that are bitching what suggestions have you offered to keep the site alive. . .l8r<hr>David said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>acctually it's twenty but we don't expect people to pay for no banners rather we expect people who have done alot for the site to be rewarded by having something good to use thier points on.<hr>Garion said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>Ok, I know that working for nothing is not very fun, but I do exactly that when I run a Tournament and Decipher gives me nothing. I´m also preparing a BIG con in Spain this year and I get nothing too, but I do it because I want to do it.<br>
<br><br>
I feel there are other ways to support the site, have you think in permiting card auctions or something like that?<br>
<br><br>
Decktech is a cool site to meet new friends and players from all over the world, so I will never rant about new oportunities, but I still think buying points is not a good idea. I feel there are other ways.<br>
So thanks the webmasters for working for all us.<hr>chicken soup said on Sat Jul 14 2001 <br>dt sux, oh no more banners suy just still the pop up ads. banners meant nothing get rid of banners and pop up ads and then ur somewhere. ur not gogin to make a penny on this thing<hr>spirajira said on Sun Jul 15 2001 <br>no, buying tech points wasnt the BEST idea, but would u guys stop acting like #&!%ing jerks.  jeez.<hr>duo said on Wed Jul 18 2001 <br>Matt they made it to help people. Every time people hit the site they get money for it. I guess you won't understand this. I don't like the fact that someone can buy 1000 tech points because they got the money. If they are out to help people then why isn't free??? Dumbass. Oh and if what I said was crying they you whine way too much. Plus I got 0 cash. I would like it better if tech points where just taken off. That way everyone would have the same oppertunies as everyone else is.<hr>ONE-ARM said on Thu Jul 19 2001 <br>Is it jsut me or did Decktech START without BAnner ADS! Those wer added and now we pay to get them removed!...<hr>Matt said on Fri Jul 20 2001 <br>They only get money if someone actually clicks on the damn banner, you ass. How many times do you think that happens? Yeah, thought so. They keep them there though, because it does bring in a LITTLE bit. You don't like the fact that people can buy points because they have money??? What are you, a #&!%ing communist? It's not even really about buying the points! It's a benefit to the people who have posted quality stuff here, and have the points to show it. This is a benefit for all the people who have been here for a long time, they deserve a few more bells and whistles than your newbie scrub just finding out what DT is. I can't help it if you have 0 cash. You're in America (I'm asssuming), get a damn job. And you're calling me a dumbass? I'd like to see you grow some balls and call me that at DecipherCon. You're "duo" alright, a duo of "sh.it" and "head". You obviously think Neal and Dave exist merely to serve you. You need to pull your head out of your ass and realize they aren't here to make you your own personalized special Decktech. Now get over it, stop whining, and deal with it. Normally I'd calm down and write something reasonable but not now, crying little bitches like you piss me off too much.<hr>duo said on Fri Jul 20 2001 <br>I have been on deck tech for a year now. I am not a scrub. I worked hard for every tech point I  have. BUt now people can buy them. I like deck tech and every thing it does and if it needs money then why don't it ask. I would be happy to pay a member ship of something like that. BUt to buy tech points really just make it where the person with the most money can buy out all the tech points there are. that is stupid. it could be this guys second time on deck tech and have over 30000 tech points while I have been workfor a year on decks and none sucj like that and only have about 3000 points. Now tell me. Is that what they intend it to be? TO just have points handed to you in a bad or something?? WEll. I guess you see my point. BUt I also see yours. The two guys who made deck tech did a very good thing. I thank them for it. I just wish there was another way for them to make money. Like a member ship fee or something. donations or something. I would do but nothing like buying tech points. oh and I will see you at deciphercon. Duo the god of death is going to deciphercon. Man. I am going to be so broke after this one and atlanta.<hr>Matt said on Fri Jul 20 2001 <br>I don't understand your irrational hatred of money. Last time I checked, this is America. Capitalism is the system. Learn to accept it or move to China. As for DecipherCon, I'll see you there. What's your real name, so I can find you if you don't find me?<hr>Matt said on Fri Jul 20 2001 <br>I do appreciate the fact that YOU appreciate Neal and Dave's work here. Perhaps I get overzealous about them, but I feel I'm right in doing so, and I will not apologize for backing them up from people who complain about this site, like you are doing. I honestly believe that without Decktech, SW:CCG would be a LOT worse off than it is now. See you at DecipherCon.<hr>Jason'Duo'Wade said on Fri Jul 20 2001 <br>Here is my name. I will try and be there. BUt as yet I cannot make any promises. BUt I will try.<hr>Josh said on Mon Jul 23 2001 <br>As I read over the commits that people have made on this site. I begin to wonder if you can't afford to buy points because you don't have money, how you can you buy the card's to play the game. So instead of buying a pack of card's, buy some point instead. Point's don't mader, they don't make you a better player. Deckteck help's make people better players, by giving people idea's about what to put in a deck. If you can say that deckteck has not helped you become a better player than why even come on the site. So maybe if we all chip in and buy point's deckteck will stay open. Beside's now we can get rid of those 1/2 stars that people give you for no reason and not lose point's. Example "this deck is not good enough to be on the top ten", so they give you a half star.<hr>Mike said on Mon Jul 23 2001 <br>The negative comments about Decktech are a joke. Its totally understandable that if you have no cash...its no big deal. Deck Tech is a FREE website and a great website that alot of you abuse on a regular basis. The kind of s.hit that goes on on this website is just stupid. Threats and arguing...sniping...is totally gay. This web site will not be free for long I can promise you. The guys I know who run it are getting sick and tired of the bulls.hit and bear in mind that this is not a f.ucking democracy. This is a FREE website that is oWNED by people which does not include you.<br>
<br>
You should enjoy this website while you can for free....because if you dont click on the banner ads and you dont buy raffle tickets...thise website may no longer be here.<br>
<br>
If you dont buy anything...thats fine...but dont complain about it. If you contribute...that buys you the right to have a say so but it better be good and at least mature.<hr>Jason said on Tue Jul 24 2001 <br>Josh, Mike you are right. I will gladly pay for this web site to stay open. But I like to earn something. I don't like to be able to buy things. I grew up with little money. The money I spend on wars and my car are hard worked for cash. And I am happy about that. I just don't think people should buy stuff that should be earned.<hr>Mike said on Tue Jul 24 2001 <br>If there is one thing I have learned while playing this game...there are a lot of cheap people who play this game. I say that to be funny and not mean. Not everyone can afford to spend gobs of money on tech points and cards and that is ok. Im not dissing anybody for that. Ive had plenty of experience in my life of not being able to buy anything I want. However...It is wrong to complain about a charity or the way someone runs HIS website. The guys at decktech came up with the idea of a charity to give some of the proceeds to and thats pretty comendable in this greed filled world. Of course there are always a handful of people who actually have the balls to complain about what charity it is!!!!! Give me a break and get a life. If you dont like it...dont contribute but for christ sake dont complain about it either. Blah blah blah.<br>
Your rants on the buzz board and here are pathetic and selfish. When was the last time any of you gave to your favorite charity? Or any charity? Most of you are young and probably dont understand or care but there are people and animals for that matter that need help...not everyone is as fortunate as you are and making fun of it or disrespecting it will come back to haunt you I guarantee it.<br>
<br>
If you think tech points should be earned instead of bought then you are looking at it all wrong...when you buy say 2000 tech points...20% of that money is going to a good cause (maybe not yours...but a good one none the less) and the tech points were earned because you did a good thing. Whats more important? Contributing to a charity or rating someones meaningless star wars deck? Think long and hard about that.<br>
Mike<hr>Josh said on Tue Jul 24 2001 <br>I think when you buy point they should put them in a different column. like one column is point's you have earned and the other is point's you buy. That way you can still have a ranking system and you also can tell who really supports deckteck and want's to keep it open and free. I would rather buy point's than pay a membership fee.<hr>Black 7 said on Thu Jul 26 2001 <br>Actually Mike, it was 10%, which is still cool, but now it is 0%, because Neal hate to be told he is wrong or something, don't know since the thread was erased.<br>
<br>
As for the charity, I think it is important for people to know what they are contributing to, which Decktech did not explain very well.<br>
<br>
I would not contribute because I have personal issues with Neal and Dave, and I feel they deserve the greif they get.<hr>Matt said on Thu Jul 26 2001 <br>Didn't explain very well? It wasn't hashed out enough for you on the rumors board?? All you need is a website, which was given, and you can do your own research on the group. And I erased the thread, mainly because I was sick of that crap. It's over with. Now apparently, there's NO charity. <br>
<br>
Personal issues with Neal and Dave? I really don't see how anyone could have a problem with either of them, but if you do, then why are you here?? Shoo, shoo.
