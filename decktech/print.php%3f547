Who is Worlds Apart? (by Pat Sullivan)<br />
_______________________________<br />
<br />
Based in Denver, Colorado, Worlds Apart Productions has been building and operating multiplayer online games for 10 years. Specializing in online digital property games and role-playing games, Worlds Apart has accomplished a history of steady growth and successful, well-designed game titles that offer deep game play and attract strong player communities.<br />
<br />
Along the way, Worlds Apart has become the premier independent developer of online trading card games. The company’s Collect! Trade! Play! (CTP) Platform is a feature-rich, cost-effective and scalable technical infrastructure for the development of online collectible-object based games. It offers a modular, data-driven development and prototyping environment, as well as rapid time-to-market for full commercial releases. Worlds Apart is currently using CTP as the foundation for the translation of paper trading card games to online form (Anachronism Online, in partnership with TriKing Games/The History Channel), as well as for the creation of original properties (the Auto Assault Trading Card Game, currently in development in partnership with NCSoft).<br />
<br />
In 2004, Worlds Apart released The Lord Of The Rings Online Trading Card Game. The online version of Decipher's best-selling The Lord of the Rings TCG uses the CTP Platform to provide secure digital property technology and a powerful rules engine so that players from around the world can interact with a virtual game environment that features secure trading and easy-to-use deck-building and collection-management utilities. The LOTR Online TCG features high-level tournaments for top players and tutorials and casual play for novices.<br />

Well, that's all well and good, but what are they REALLY like? Let's turn to Pat Sullivan again to find out.<br />
<br />
I met WA head honcho, Scott Martins, back at GenCon 2003, when it was in Milwaukee. I remember him asking me what I thought of the idea of LOTR Online and I thought it was an amazing idea (never having played Magic Online myself, but hearing it was good fun). In short time, he invited me to become an alpha tester which was a very rewarding experience. I got to meet tons of beta testers in short time and the community of players grew together from that. It was an awesome time and it was great to be there from the beginning. There was some great deals on the game in the first two weeks that I was stupid not to have taken advantage of. Throughout the whole experience, WA offered tremendous quality of support for any issues the community had about improving the game, the interface or whatever. Being a Alpha then beta tester was a total blast. Great company, great game, great community of players.<br />

<br />
lol, just kiddin' but I nominate Neal Razi for Sullivan-Hating-Editor-of-the-Year<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Mar 25 2006 <br>it skips over your text? Well, it was supposed to be an endless loop that kept people ON your text for the rest of their life... but i must have messed up<hr>Patrick Sullivan said on Mon Mar 27 2006 <br>well then, you keep on workin' on it :)<hr>Michael Carr said on Tue Mar 28 2006 <br>There is an online Anachronism game?  Where?<hr>George Wilson said on Thu Mar 30 2006 <br>I think this is actually a really enjoyable game. It's the type of thing that I can turn to when I'm sick of LOTRO. This one's more action-packed, and while it lacks a bit of strategy, there are a significant amount of 'cultures' to make this a great game in the long run. I recommend it for sure.
