<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Houston, we have a DPC ... and with Magic posted by DeckTech on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Big news fans!  New DPC on the way in the gaming HQ of Houston at <a href="http://www.strikezoneonline.com/" target="x">Strike Zone Gaming</a> on July 12-14.<br>
<br>
<a href="mailto:alandenny@decktech.net"><b>Alan Denny</b></a>, Old Skool Star Wars CCG player, Squadron Member and Rider of Rohan deserves the credit on this one.  Hooking you up with not only a pack of great games, but also a great venue, Alan is one of the premiere Organizers and Players in Houston.<br>
<br>
Check the schedule below for the lowdown on Magi Nation Duel, Star Wars TCG, Lord of the Rings,  SWCCG, A <b>free</b> YJ Sealed deck, and... you asked and you finally got it... Magic: The Gathering!<br>
<br>
This marks DeckTech's first appearance of the grandfather of all TCG's <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> at a DPC.  The main event: a $1000 winner take all tournament.  Yep, 2nd place gets a big fat pat on the back, and that is it!  I love it!<br>
<br>
Finally, let's get a word in about <br>
<a href="http://www.strikezoneonline.com/" target="x">Strike Zone Gaming</a>.  Of course, as you know, one of the DPC's goals this year is to introduce you to outstanding retailers.  While this didn't go as planned in Vegas, this time there is no doubt, Strike Zone is fantastic.  Room for 150+ gamers, Buy and even sell everything from Yu-gi-oh to Lord of the Rings to Magic to Hero Clix, and gamer friendly, this is the store for Texas.  Home of a Pro Tour Event and Qualifiers, they hold regular Cash prize Magic events with the only Level 3 judge in the state!  Check it out online, and bring some cash when you are there, cause this is one great store.<br>
<br>
Look for lots of new faces with Magic, but also lots of familiar faces from DeckTech as well.  If it's Texas, you know both Old Skooler, Mike Patterson and Ryan "cardmaster" Christian will be in attendance.  Rumors also of Teen Heartthrob Hayes Hunter and his group, and DPC Rulings Committee Chairman Charlie Herren and some of the Atlanta crowd attending are already circulating.  Searaptor may make his return to Texas, Hoostino his return to gaming.  Van Der Meer armed with Virtual Cards?  Cheryl Hooks out of retirement?  Very possibly.<br>
<br>
Ok, then here's the schedule.  Any question, just email <a href="mailto:alandenny@decktech.net"><b>alandenny@decktech.net</b></a>.<br>

Great work Alan and Strike Zone!<hr>Paul Myers said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>So where should I fly into?  Houston-Hobby or Houston-Bush?  Thanks.<hr>Alan Denny said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>OH boys and girls this will be huge.  And I promise no one is getting kicked out at 6pm ... we will give ya til at least 6:15 ...=0)<hr>Gabriel Alonso said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>So close to Origins. Hmmm. I wonder if I can scrounge up enough cash to get there. My dad lives in Houston. So there is a strong possibility I will attend.<hr>Jeremy Hodes said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Sounds awsome! I will go if i can, just have to find a ride from here in austin, i pay gas money :) any volunteers?<hr>Matt Berta said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Teen Heartthrob Hayes Hunter? More like Asian Teen Heartthrob!<hr>Justin Warren said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I never left! I'll be there to play Wars.<hr>Michael Girard said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>whoa...if Vandemeer and Gabe Alonso are showing up then I will probably have to make the trip as well.  It's just a question of what game to play ;)<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>how exactly does hayes pull the asians? most of the tabs (trendy asian b!tches) dont screw anyone without a car souped up to the power of a ferrari...<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Guys watch the asian comments, no kidding.  You are on the edge of getting rude.  Asian people are the nicest in the world, in my opinion, and I dated a Japanese girl for 5 yrs.<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Y'all are gonna be in MY state, people. Just to make this more cool, (not to mention drain my checking account some more...), I'm posting this challenge: If you get matched up with me at this DPC, and win, I'll give you $50 cash on the spot. Bam. That's over double your entry fee right there. Scrubs: get paired up against me early, get lucky, and who knows? Good players: Y'all got my number already. I'm not the player I used to be, but I've got faith in the home-turf advantage, for what it's worth. 50 bucks is 50 bucks people, and that's just a side thing from the whole money pot. So get down to Houston and let's make this the biggest DPC yet! <br>"HOUSTON, BABY!!"<hr>Nathan Friedman said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>...Blows the dust off the big box of SWCCG cards under his bed...<br>
<br>
50 bucks?  You just convinced me to stay for Sunday's SWCCG.  I think I might have a good shot at that under 1700 prize too.<br>
<br>
All-time SWCCG record: 4-14<br>
All-time record vs Matt Lush: 1-0(don't think im gonna catch him unprepared for Lightsaber combat this time)<br>
<br>
I think I'll be playing in almost every damn game there.  Free YJ sealed?  Why not!<hr>Cortney Haggerty said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>only 3 games for SW? $20? jeez.<hr>Andrew Harwell said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>How's the Magi-Nation community in Texas?  I may try to fly over there if it promises to be a big turnout.  <hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Hey Cortney,  Re-read that is 3 ounds which is 6 games.  Three light and thre dark and then the final confrontations.<hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Hey Matt,  Now that Houston is back on the map how do we get Warren, Van Der Meer, Tim Courtney, and the rest of the originals back into action.  <br>
<br>
Tell you what everybody since I know Lush is still the man and Texas has to "represent" I will up the anti and anyone who beats Lush will get there entry fee back on the spot.  Beat him twice and I will give you another $30.00.  How about that boys and girls come to Texas and beat Lush on his home court and you could get an extra $100.00 just for beating one player.  And a little more sweetening ... If you are rated under 1700 and beat him I will let you pick any one card out of my collection and people who know me know I have any and everything.  Come Prepared for a good ole Texas show down.<br>
See ya in July.<hr>Cortney Haggerty said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>ha, im a dumbass!<hr>Gordon Kane said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Andrew - MND is alive and well in Austin and the Dallas / Fort Worth area, but our attempt to have a decent MND tourney at Owl Con this past February generated ZERO participants.<br>
<br>
And to those already in Houston - I miss Browser Games.  <br>
Will the Event Horizons judges be present for the Magic event?<hr>Brian Hunter said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>heh.  this "beat on lush for bonus prizes" stuff is pretty funny.  too bad that wasn't going on in Vegas.  ;)  So how much do I have to bribe the judge, to guarantee me a game 1 pairing against the Old Skooler?  :)  Just kiddin' ya, Matt.  HOUSTON, BABY!!  <hr>Alan Denny said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>I do not know which judges will be present for the Magic tourney.  Dustin the owner of the store is handling that but I would assume one of the guys from Event Horizon will be there, probably Tim Weisman, but that is not confirmed.<br>
<br>
And being the judge at the event I am usually a cheap bribe but in this case ... gotta see Matt and Texas take the wins ...Hoo Ahh<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Alan: Jeez, just pour the pressure on, why don't ya...lol. Guess I better start working on those decks NOW...as for the names you mentioned, I'll be riding down with Justin, so no worries about him, but last time I talked to Jon he was in Chicago, and for all I know Tim may be in China somewhere by now! Don't expect to see those two. Mike Patterson? Dunno...I think he'll at least show up to say hey to everyone. <br>Brian: You'll notice I said all the good players already have my number, but who knows...maybe I'll Sense your OOC next time...and then who knows what will happen? :D (Well, I've got a good guess, but still, anything can happen, dammit...)<hr>Tim Guzman said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Hey Free money :)  I have a very small chance of making it, but now I really need to get the time off.  Berta, we need to make this trip somehow.  And Texas friends, any Idea's on places to stay?<hr>Robert Hendon said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>I will be there as well. I can try and get certified as a magic judge real quick. I know all the rules still and it shouldn't be too hard. I am already a TO for WoTC so I can set people up with dci cards for mtg and swtcg. Alan if ya need help, just ask man. I will play star wars just to try and win some cash from pure luck as long as I can still borrow some cards. At least 2 people from atlanta have to drive to since me and ryan made the trip last time. Oh well lets see if we can fill this store with people for lotr unlike we did for the open.<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Not sure on the place to stay thing, Tim. Every time I've gone to Houston for a tourney I've come back the same day, so I guess some cheap notel motel somewhere or something. It's a 3 hour drive for me there, that'd be a hell of a commute. Anyone in Houston got something? <hr>Brian Wright said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Wow, gunning for Old Skooler to pick up some extra cash and I only have to drive an hour?  Count me in!  Paul Myers:  I'd suggest flying into Hobby, cause Bush is a pain in the @$$.  Anyone who wants to fly in to Hobby for the tournament: I may not be able to put you up at my place (I'll look into it), but I would be glad to pick you up at the airport (Hobby) and help you find a place to stay.  My car seats 5, so if you want to take me up on this let me know asap.  E-mail/AIM: Bean2213@aol.com, D-mail: Brian "Bean2213" Wright<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Forget bribing the Judge! Just promise Lush to give him his $50 dollars back :-P<hr>Wes Brown said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>I may yet make this tourney.  No promises, but I'm definitely working on it.  We simply MUST drag Tim and Cheryl out of whatever hole they've been hiding in and have them swing by to say hi to everyone.<br>
<br>
Keep you posted.<hr>Lyle Waldman said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>I would like to compete in the Magic competition, but unfortunately, Texas is practically halfway around the world from me.  No, I don't live in Russia.  I live in Canada.  Halfway around the world in a southwards direction.  er...make that a quarter.  Anyway, I'm still in school (not University, I mean high school) and my parents would NEVER pay for me to go to the competition.  I'd like to mee Old Skooler though.  If anyone sees Cardmaster, tell him hi for me and that he never replied to my Dmail about an SW deck...<hr>David Jones said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>Hmm shyte happens so i missed vegas so i might have to make trip.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>HOUSTON BABY! Somehow it just doesn't sound the same... Maybe I'll make the trip. You only beat me because I drew 1 of 4 low destiny cards in the deck (instead of 6), and I got squashed because of it! ;-)<br><br>
<br>
And I checked D's website - my rating got erased after the ratings switched over, so I'm 1600-something! Here comes the "under 1700" prize... tee hee...<br><br>
<br>
(I'll bring my own decks this time around)<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Jun 7 2002 <br>Steve Marshall going for the under 1700 prize!  Geez, I guess I better check my rating, I haven't since like December.  It'd be just petty enough of Decipher to ruin the ratings of all the DTers like me and Marshall!<hr>Alan Denny said on Fri Jun 7 2002 <br>YOu know I'm like a 1691 so if I played I could get second place and the under 1700 prize and watch the rest of the country weap as two Texas Old Skoolers ... Skool the rest of the country .....<br>
<br>
See yall in July ... <hr>Gabriel Alonso said on Fri Jun 7 2002 <br>Can you give us some details on the nearest airport and accomodations close to the venue? Thanks<hr>Alan Denny said on Sat Jun 8 2002 <br>Tell you what Neal ... <br>
<br>
From here on out until the DPC Houston any one who takes first place in a LOTR Territorial Open Championship, SWCCG Regional Championship, or a SWCCG Mini-Open will recieve free entry into their respective DPC Tourney.<br>
<br>
That makes the trip here to Houston worth wild.  Come in and play after winning an earlier event and it won't cost you a dime.  Now that is some incentive.  <br>
<br>
I am looking at getting a cheaper rate for a hotel close to the venue.  The closest airport to fly into is IAH (Bush Intercontinental) but it is also a bigger pain in the a$$ to deal with.<br>
<br>
See yall soon<hr>jason wade said on Mon Jun 10 2002 <br>after dpc atlanta, franklin regional, and mobile regional my cash resevers are exasted. Sorry the god of death can't make this one..but I might make orgains and I will make dragon con and decipher con. Later decktech<hr>John Contreras said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>I'll offer transportation to out of towners also, I want as many people to come down to H-town as possible. If any other assistance is needed, let me know, I'll do what I can.<hr>John Contreras said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>My email didn't make the last post: lsprof4@aol.com<hr>Paul Myers said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>Wow, Ive so gotta buy my plane ticket now.  This whole beat Lush thing is seeming pretty appealling to me($70 for beating him once!).  Anyway.  Alan- Do we gain free entry into the DPC if weve previouslly won a DPC that year and also paying over $200 for their plane ticket?  *Cough Cough*  LoL, cant wait for this event, better start clearing it past the parents!  Later. <hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jun 13 2002 <br>The free entry was part of a promotion we ran with Mike Girard for Arizona.<br>
<br>
Thing is if everyone is free, they'll be no prizes!<hr>Matt Lush said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>Not a good idea to get all crazy with the freebies and such...my $50 deal is a SIDE event to the main one. And since it's my own money, of course, it won't lesson the actual DPC Prize pot, which should NOT be watered down with a bunch of free entries and such. It's just incentive to make this the biggest damn DPC ever.<hr>Matt Lush said on Fri Jun 14 2002 <br>er, lesson = lessen. I could use a lessen in spelling...
