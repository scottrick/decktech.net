I repeat that DecipherCon has nothing to do with anything around here.  I'm sure whoever wins it deserves a lot of respect, but it doesn't have a goddam thing to do with DT.  <br>
<br>
He can make fun of the DT player of the year all he wants.  That's his opinion, and my opinion is that his opinion is retarded.  And Hayes if you think the Winner of <b>Decipher</b>Con has anything to do with the <b>DeckTech</b> Player of the year, as you seem to indicate, then you must be retarded as well.  Here's a hint: look at the words in bold.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I'm concluding you are retarded Hayes.  Uh, "<b>Not once did you declare any sort (of - sic) criteria for determining the player of the year</b>"??  Uh, yes, i did.  It was the person who won the most at DPC events.  Or did you miss that?  Guess you did.  Guess you missed the poll for like a month too.<br>
<br>
Hayes, furthermore, you and your brother can "Hysterically laugh" as you state all you want.  You both won jack at DPC events.  You won nothing, and Brian won every event.  Taking away from Brian's accomplishments, just because you don't like him, is ridiculous.  Give the guy some props, you two sore losers.  I'm sure if you beat him at DecipherCon, he'd give you yours.<br>

Look at this thread Neal; you're the only one getting upset here.  Additionally, neither my brother nor I ever made fun of the DT POTY program, calling it stupid or worthless or anything like that.  And how could you think that either of us (or anyone, for that matter) could be jealous of Hunter (especially over him getting a Rook Endura)?<br>
