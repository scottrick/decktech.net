<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Two DeckTech Milestones posted by DeckTech on Wed Apr 3 2002 <br>Well, here's two DeckTech milestones and some stats for ya.  It seems yesterday we signed up our 10,000th member!  One Mr. Niles "oceanwaiting" Li.  Glad to have you aboard sir!  Sadly, you will receive nothing other than a pat on the back (to be delivered in person at your nearest DPC).  <br>
<br>
Also, we just had submitted our 1500th <b>Lord of the Rings</b> deck.  With 1500 Lord of the Rings decks in just 4 months, this area of the site has grown by leaps and bounds.  This makes us the biggest lord of the rings site (to mention nothing of the quality of the top notch players you all are famous for) by approximately a factor of 2.  Thought I'd break down some DeckTech stats for you all.<br>
<br>
<b>Star Wars</b><br>
13021 decks<br>
1160 articles<br>
2458 tournament reports<br>
<br>
<b>Lord of the Rings</b><br>
1557 lotr decks<br>
312 articles<br>
215 tournament reports<br>
<br>
<b>Magi Nation Duel</b><br>
363 decks<br>
61 articles<br>
21 tournament reports<br>
<br>
MND has come on very strong in the 2 months it has been here, and is also growing rapidly.  The DeckTech members of MND are possibly the most active on the site.  Great job Duelers!<br>
<br>
With the largest and best quality submissions for Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and MND (see also, Mpire.com, Insiider.com, and the hybernating Magi-World.com, all excellent MND websites), combined with cutting edge internet technology, and the best Multi-Game Pro-Tour: <b>The DPC</b>, you can be sure <b>DeckTech.net</b> will always be the best repository for TCG information on the internet!<br>
