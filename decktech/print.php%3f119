<br>
Announcing 2iD<br>
<br>
<b>What?</b><br>
That's right, we're making a big change: your Magi Council number is now<br>
your 2iD! The digits of your number have not changed; we've simply changed<br>
the name of the program.<br>
<br>
<b>Who?</b><br>
If you've played in a sanctioned tournament, joined the Grand Magi Council<br>
or registered your name on our website, you were given a Magi Council<br>
number. Everyone with a Magi Council number now has a 2iD instead. The<br>
number's the same; it's the name that's different.<br>
<br>
<b>When?</b><br>
This has already happened. You may not have noticed it because your number<br>
stayed the same; it just has a new name.<br>
<br>
<b>Why?</b><br>
In preparation for new properties we have in development, and to clarify the<br>
current confusion between Magi Council number and Grand Magi Council<br>
membership, we have switched to 2iD to track our players. This change will<br>
in no way affect your membership to the Grand Magi Council or your<br>
tournament rating.<br>
