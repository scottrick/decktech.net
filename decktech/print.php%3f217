<br>
Steven Lewis is now edged out by Brian Hunter!  Brian's $40 in Star Wars TCG, gives him a $55 lead over Steven.  With a DPC planned in the NE and the Midwest, who will finish the year at #1?<br>
<br>
Also, many Magic people are making an appearance way up on the leader board after last weekend.  Everyone is included under their game, so look for your name!  Pictures can be added on request as well.<br>
<br>
Congrats to all, once again Alan and Adam as well as all the players.<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed Jul 17 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Jul 17 2002 <br>Midwest?
