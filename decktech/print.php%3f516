<h2>www.decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Pan Preview with reviews and discussion! Drool, you know you want it! posted by DeckTech on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>For our first spoiler from Green Lantern (Courtesy of our buddies Toby Wachter and Omeed Dariani, thanks guys!), we've got the much discussed but often misunderstood Pan here.<br />
<br />
From now on, our DT spoiler man Cyke and I will be doing a Siskel & Ebert style review, partly out of homage to my all time favorite film critics and partly because it's a great dicussion format!<br />
<br />
Chris and I had no idea wht the other would write until this moment, so enjoy, because we had two different takes. And so you can see who we are talking about, here is Pan in all his, err, umm, "glory".<br />

Pan - Taking evens just got better!<br />
<br />
So as you can see, here is the anatomically incorrect Pan from the Manhunter team of the new Green Lantern set. At 8 attack, he has that better than average 7, but at 6 defense, he's one down the notch. No flying or range.<br />
<br />
But his gametext is where this greek wannabe shines. Whenever Pan causes breakthrough to a player, you can name a card (except characters: no fair!) and strip the opponent of any of that lovely strategy right out of their draw deck.<br />
<br />
Staples like Teen Titans Go!, signal flare, reconstruction program, and oh, say Savage Beatdown all go bye bye, with no Garth getting them back. Heck, even things like The Source or Genosha are not immune from this little goat.<br />
<br />
Now granted that cards in their hand or already stacked arent going anywhere, but turn 4 might be early enough to do some serious damage to the opponent's strategy. And unlike The Source, you actually get a pretty decent character!<br />
<br />
With 8 attack, it gets a lot easier to cause breakthrough, but what about reinforcement? Well, in addition to the obvious blindsided, how about using Play Time in the upcoming DC Marvel Age? That's a great way to take out reinforcement!<br />
<br />
Final Call: Thumbs up on this heavy hitting deck manipulator from Neal<br />
<br />
Chris Summers<br />
<br />
Here is Pan, an evil robot in the guise of the deceased servant of Mt. Olympus. So much for women’s intuition, eh, Wonder Woman? Well, that might have been the briefest character background in history, but who cares on with the card. <br />
<br />
At first glance, what we have here is a character with an over-powering ability, and lop-sided stats to help that over-powered ability kick in. I mean we were all going crazy when the source was released, and Pan is the source on a goat. Right?<br />
<br />
Not exactly, see Pan can’t remove cards in your hand or resource row, unlike the source. But he can remove cards you have not even seen yet. So if you have a good knowledge of your opponent’s deck, then you can do a little pre-emptive strike before he has a chances to teen titans go! or cover fire. Of course if they already had the card in hand or in the resource row, or have a way to search for the non-character card, such as the butlers (Alfred and Boris- yeah technically Boris is not a butler, but whatever) then they can search for the card you named in response to Pan’s eating the cards like the goat he is, and Pan won’t be able catch’ em all. But still, you will be able to remove some of the copies, and that is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
However, I think his most useful, uhm, use is how he can make your opponents change their game plan and tactics once he hits the table. You had better believe he will have a huge bull’s-eye sheared into his wool, or that the opponents will make sure they position their field in such a way as to stop Pan from dealing breakthrough- his lack of flight really hurts.  And there is the problem, if Pan has the initiative, then the defending player can form to stop BEL. And if Pan goes second, he won’t make it to attack on this turn with his low defense. Also, by turn 4, most of the important plot twist or locations should have been drawn. And there are not a lot of PT’s you need in multiples, sure TTG! is one of them, but that is what Garth is for. Maybe reconstruction program’s or a child named Valeria, but overall, I think that the 4 spot is too vital to waste on a character that thins your opponent’s deck of cards he won’t need anyway.<br />
<br />
Final verdict- And I know I may take flak on this, but I give goat-boy a thumbs down. He is decent character, but while his effect may look flashy, it won’t change the outcome of many games, and could do more good for your opponent than harm.<hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>Haha, ok, wow, very interesting, two different opinions! I can see where Chris is coming from, you might knock out cards that the opponent would never be seeing.<br />
<br />
Still, I feel a lot safer just looking through my opponents deck, and say taking out all Genosha's and knowing "ok, he has one left in his resource row" and i can plan accordingly.<br />
<br />
And 8/6 aint a bad character - but he does require prep.<hr>Kenneth Bradford said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>The fact that he now says "non-character" card name--the original spoiler I saw didn't have that text--means he's really just a weaker The Source.  THUMBS DOWN<br />
<br />
<br />
Neal, if you want to do more of these, I'll be happy to contribute.<hr>chris summers said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>the source is not even that much of a deal, easy to play around, and not as crippling as we all thought it would.<br />
<br />
and pan is just the source-lite, so that makes him even worse.  but i do admit his power is flashy but he is just a flash in the pan.<br />
<br />
hehe, i made a pun.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>wow, good discussion here! Yeah, I am sort of coming around to your thinking - source light.  I have seen the source be a major pain in the butt though...<br />
<br />
Sure, Ken, we could do that. Always nice to have your input.<br />
<br />
These are great, both reviews were funny. I dont know if you know but Pan in mythology usually comes, uh, equipped. Heh heh.<hr>Ryan French said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>is the martian manhunter jon jonz part of this team?  because that would be sweet.<hr>PATRICK MOORE said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>One cool thing about Pan, is that he lets YOU look througfh YOUR OPPONENTS deck to remove the cards....letting you see most (if not all) of the other guy's serprises.<hr>PATRICK MOORE said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>I wouldn't mind getting a spoiler too, if your handing them out that is.<hr>chris summers said on Fri Apr 22 2005 <br>the martain manhunter is not part of this group.<br />
<br />
the manhunters were the gaurdians first attempt at creating a cosmic police force, but they took their job too seriuosly and saw in just black and white, hence whole cities would be nuked to catched one criminal, so the green lanterns were made, and the manhunters were given the boot, and they did not take that too well.
