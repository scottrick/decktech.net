<br />
Greetings one and everyone! Its once again time to pull out another fun top ten list for you fine folks who might be wondering one evening what movie to rent. Luckily at the time I wrote this, many of these fine films are still playing in theatres so I highly recommend to catch them if you can on the big screen. I wanted to write this article before the Oscars came out so that Im not influenced at all by those results. <br />
<br />
Most of us think of 2006 as a year very dry of good films. If fine cinema was a planet, 2006 would be Dune (if that brilliant analogy doesnt get me an extra half-star from Ken, I dont know what will). But as we go through this top ten, youll notice that its very end-of-year heavy. Why is that? Why have ALL the good movies of the year come out in the last couple months of 2006? At first I thought this was a coincidence but perhaps this is a new trend where any Oscar-worthy films (meaning, non summer-blockbuster) are intentionally released towards the end of the year to better their chances at winning an Oscar for being fresh in the minds of the Academy. Ill have to see if this is repeated in 2007 before drawing any formal conclusions. <br />
<br />
One last thing I noticed about 2006. It was VOID of any good animated films. Usually theres one or two at least every year that are decent. But this year, the Oscar winner will most likely be Cars which was awful. Did anyone else get stuck seeing Happy Feet?! OMG, that was SO bad. <br />
<br />
Anyway, lets begin with the honourable mentions. Those fine films that I simply could not find a place for in this list:<br />
-	Little Miss Sunshine (a truly excellent film but ultimately forgettable, worth watching once). <br />
-	An Inconvenient Truth (I really liked this movie but it just doesnt belong in a top ten given its obvious flaws)<br />
-	Half Nelson (it pains me not to find space for this movie. I think everyone would love this film but I just didnt like it enough to put it in the top ten)<br />
-	Inside Man (the ONLY really good movie of the first half of 2006. Terrific caper movie that unfortunately got drowned out by the flood of great movies in late 2006).<br />
-	The Proposition (if you remember right, this was one of my top movies of 2005. It apparently is considered a 2006 release as well. Id look stupid for putting it into two back-to-back top tens so I left it out. But if it truly is a 2006 release, this belongs in the top ten)<br />
-	The Descent (a decent horror flick with an OK underlying story)<br />
-	Slither (a real decent attempt to make a fun horror flick). <br />
-	Brick (a truly excellent film but it wont appeal to many. I didnt like it enough to put it in top ten regardless of how cute the chick in the movie is)<br />
-	Rocky Balboa (if 2006 was a little more lackluster in good movies, this one could have easily slid into top ten. It was quite the strong picture). <br />
-	Last King of Scotland (man, I was SURE I was going to put this on the list. Its really quite an excellent, but very violent, movie. There was one or two things that bugged me about it and I guess thats why, ultimately, I couldnt put it on my top ten. But it was extraordinary and Forest Whitaker is sure to win Best Actor for his amazing performance in this one). <br />
<br />
Ok, now that we got that out of the way, lets see what DID make my list. And remember, you might be able to catch some of these in theatres before they leave. You should really make the effort. If not, then do rent these at some point. <br />
<br />
<br />
10. Babel<br />
<br />
The Crash/Syriana of 2006. A movie that was largely liked by critics but hated by quite a few. And that was the exact same reaction that Crash got. Basically the director is taking a theme (Crash had racism, Babel uses Communication) and then telling many different stories at once (four in Babels case) and you get to watch how they unfold together. Its a fun way to watch a movie and you will generally find yourself more intrigued with one or two of the stories far more than another (I, myself, was partial to the Japan story, and Im SO happy she got nominated for best supporting actress (although shell never win, yo)). <br />
<br />
Its probably a better movie than Crash and youll get the same cumulative effect of the in-your-face story telling making it a fairly exhausting (thats not a decktech filter) movie to watch. When you leave the movie theatre, youll feel like you were at the gym. Some will not like this and feel that the movie piles on too much but I wasnt one of them. I think the stories were really strong (the Mexican nanny story is very powerful) and the acting was top notch. Youd be hard pressed not to be moved by the Japanese girls struggle with communication. The film is done in five languages (sign language being one of them) and youll get English subtitles throughout. I think its my only top ten choice that I wouldnt necessarily recommend to everyone. It will appeal to most, but not all.  <br />
<br />
<br />
9. Joyeux Noel<br />
<br />
Two foreign language films in a row! Heres another one that would appeal to most but not to all. I LOVED this film (and just happened to watch it on Xmas of 2006 to boot!). Be warned, this is an overly sentimental telling of one of the most mythologized war stories of all time. But its so moving and uplifting that youll eat it up and love it. <br />
<br />
Youve probably heard about it but it tells the tale of when soldiers in the first World War lay down their guns across the line for a period of time to celebrate Xmas. The unofficial and unauthorized ceasefire happened at many places along the frontlines and lasted much longer in some sections than it did in others. This one documents one such place where French, Scottish and German lines were all meeting. Its a very warm and at times humorous telling of a very humanitarian moment in war. I highly recommend this film. Its just beautiful.<br />
<br />
<br />
As good as those two movies were, the following eight pictures are a strong cut above the rest. It would be hard to say 2006 was totally berift (sp?) of any quality pictures when you think of these eight. I think that everyone would really like all these films.  <br />
<br />
<br />
8. Letters From Iwo Jima<br />
<br />
This COULD be the most humanistic war movie Ive ever seen. Its told from the viewpoint of the American-loving Japanese General given control of the defence of the strategic island and also from the viewpoint of a lowly private who gets drafted and whos heart is clearly not in it simply for the sake of dying for the Empire. <br />
<br />
I dont know why Flags of Our Fathers is considered the more entertaining film of the two. I found Flags to be VERY bland and to not have any heart to it at all. Whereas this movie is VERY deep and moving. Clint Eastwood has essentially made a movie celebrating soliders that fight a lost war (sounds kinda topical doesnt it?). The story of Iwo Jima is one that is not known to the average Japanese citizen. They dont learn about it in school since its a defeat and is thus dishonorable. This movie has been a huge hit in Japan since it was released since it tells an untold story. <br />
<br />
Its superbly acted and looks far beyond politics but instead directly into the hearts and minds of the men the U.S. needed to call the enemy. What I really like is that Eastwood doesnt go easy on the brutality of the Japanese war machine. Simply humanizing the Japanese soldiers and officers involved at Iwo Jima does not erase the warcrimes committed by Japan. Eastwoods point is that the battalions serving the Emperor were as much the victims of Japanese militarism as the G.I.s they fought against. <br />
<br />
The real interesting part is simply watching how men behave when they know they cannot win. And that alone is reason to watch this movie. Its a really great movie and I cant really think of anyone not liking it. <br />
<br />
<br />
7. Children of Men<br />
<br />
Is there any level on which this movie doesnt work? You could watch it as a thriller and it would work, you could watch it as a drama and it would deliver, you could even watch it as a cautionary tale and it would remind you very much of V for Vendetta. In fact, thats very much what this movie is like. Its like the really good version of V for Vendetta (and dont get me wrong, I LOVED that movie). <br />
<br />
The filmmaking is totally dazzling. This movie should really be seen on the big screen if at all possible. What I really like about movies like this is that it takes guts to leave questions unanswered. Often movies think that audiences will be really pissed off if you leave a bunch of questions unanswered (George Lucas must have thought this when he made Episode III but should have left some mystery in that film). But leaving mystery and activating the imagination of your audience can be a really powerful moviemaking tool if done right. Children of Men does this VERY well. You dont get frustrated at all when youre sitting there wondering a bunch of things. Youre being too entertained and I like that it leaves you trying to answer some of these questions yourself. <br />
<br />
Its such an old movie formula of some negative, cynical tough guy thats supposed to see some innocent girl to safety but this film delivers SO much on that old premise. The filmmaker decides to add layer after layer after layer onto that and pulls you along for the ride. And its a rough one. After playing Gears of War, I was really enjoying the hand-held camera jangles too. Its not like Blair Witch nausea at all. This is war-time CNN footage camera work. Very cool stuff. <br />
<br />
Im really starting to dig these futuristic movies that are devoid of anything really futuristic. Its amazing that the movie actually gets pigeon-holed into sci-fi just because its set in the future. This is basically the Nativity Story being told with a ton of adrenaline. <br />
<br />
Finally, let me say this, since Ive actually said quite a bit about this motion picture. The story is SO fast-paced, that believe me when I tell you that you wont have time to think about or remember anything Ive said here today. Enjoy the ride!<br />
<br />

6. Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan<br />
<br />
An Oscar nominee! Wouldnt that be great if it won for Best Adapted Screenplay? It has some tough competitors and I cant figure out, just yet, who will win that category but I think its wicked awesome that this movie got an Academy Award nomination. Cuz its really THAT good. This aint no Jackass, its Jackass with a high I.Q.  This is just some good movie making. Make no mistake tho, this is an offensive movie (even I was offended once or twice), but its offensive in the most hilarious type of way. <br />
<br />
I think what I liked best about it is some of the message the movie conveys. The people he talks to are very much the symbolic heart of the United States, where intolerance is worn increasingly with pride. And then, the most down-to-Earth and humble people in the movie are the ones typically most reviled by others (prostitutes, etc.). If you liked how awesome the transvestite was on The Worlds Fastest Indian, youll really like some of the scenes in this one. <br />
<br />
Funniest moment? Not sure, but Id have to go with the live bear they keep in the back of an Ice Cream truck and when a bunch of kids come for ice cream, theyre greated by a roaring bear. LOL. Awesome. <br />
<br />
Its definitely a movie that should be watched by all. There are some difficult scenes but its well worth it to have fun with the entire thing. Most certainly one of the best movies of the year. <br />
<br />
<br />
5. United 93<br />
<br />
Its difficult even for me to begin to write about this movie. Ive watched a few movies on 9/11 (World Trade Centre, Flight 93, etc) and none have been as potent or gut-wrenching as this one. But while its a difficult movie to watch because the outcome is already known, this movie was made with SO much more respect to the subject matter than those other films. Both Flight 93 and World Trade Centre were really hammed up with extra emotion poured into it. But when youre talking about an event as horrific as 9/11, you dont need to put anything into the film other than the facts. So its almost as if this film was untouched by Hollywood. This cast of unknowns are SO effective at portraying the passengers of this doomed flight that you really feel like youre there. And youre left asking yourself if youd actually be able to respond with similar bravery to such extraordinary circumstances. <br />
<br />
This movie is regarded as the most fact-checked docu-drama 9/11 film shot yet. And in that regard, this is one of the most important and difficult films of our time. He brings the story of United Airlines Flight 93 to life (and to death) with nobility thats almost too hard to bear. I left with a feeling like the filmmakers really did something right. <br />
<br />
The movie unfolds in real time and that helps to honour what was so brave in how those people made extraordinary use of those last minutes in their refusal to go quietly. <br />
<br />
In short, what I really think worked the most is that it isnt told from the viewpoint of the families (which was the case in Flight 93 and World Trade Centre). Instead, its told from the viewpoint of everyone that was involved (the pilots, the passengers, Air Traffic Control, Kennedy Airport Tower, NORAD and even the terrorists). So its the first look at how other people with the power and responsibility to do something reacted to the event as it went on. Its really an amazing motion picture and I strongly recommend it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now as much as those last were a cut above the rest, the following top four movies are truly la crème de la crème of 2006. These four would all receive 5 stars out of 5 and are worthy of becoming cinematic classics. When I think of 2006 years from now, Ill remember that at the very least we got the following four movies which were all incredible pieces of motion art. <br />
<br />
4. The Departed<br />
<br />
Although not my absolute favourite movie of 2006, I will concede the point that this movie should and will win the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director (about time for Scorsese). I was floored when I saw this picture and at the time, I definitely thought it was the best picture of the year (if you had told me at the time that I would see three better movies in the next month or two, I wouldnt have believed you). This is probably the most entertaining gangster dramatic film I have ever seen. I prefer it to Good Fellas even. In fact, this is largely why I think Scorsese will win Best Director because I dont honestly see how he could ever make a better movie. The party theyll throw for him after winning Best Director might as well be a retirement party as well.<br />
<br />
Its another very violent motion picture but this time, instead of sickening the audience with violence, I find that this movie seduces you with it. And be warned, youll be seduced relentlessly! <br />
<br />
The movie is story telling at its best and what I really liked is that they through in a fair bit of comedy into such a testosterone-soaked film. Matt Damon really shines in this role and Jack Nickolson definitely steals any scene hes in. DiCaprio does a fine job as well but its nothing like his performance in Blood Diamond. <br />
<br />
I really hope it does pull off winning the Best Picture because this is a film that belongs in the history books of epic gangster movies. Tremendous film. A must-see. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Casino Royale<br />
<br />
From one action-packed testosterone adventure to the next, Casino Royale delivers in spades. And Im not even a Bond fan! Which is precisely why I liked this movie. Bond movies are SO formulaic what with the gadgets and really lame ways that the villain tries to kill Bond (see any Austin Powers movie for a good depiction), that this movie had the guts to intensely reinvent how a Bond movie should be done, won me back to the franchise. <br />
<br />
I think the fact that they made Bond so much darker and meaner makes the film WAY better to watch. Its wicked cool to see a Bond that actually WANTS to kill since it makes his missions so much easier to pull off. That darkness finally makes him very unpredictable and a few of his actions took me completely by surprise. A feat that no other Bond movie could ever pull off (i.e. Ill bet you my house that Bond orders his martini shaken...). Whatever you do, dont make those kinds of bets in THIS Bond movie. <br />
<br />
One thing that this movie has that NO other great movie (possible exception: Brick) had in 2006 had was a really cute chick. What the heck happened to the movies this year? Thank goodness for Eva Green in Casino Royale who totally delivers the goods. Making her the best Bond chick since 1979s Dr. Holly Goodhead in Moonraker. <br />
<br />
The movie is one long and extended adrenaline rush and is exactly what the doctor ordered for the Bond franchise. I cant wait for the next one (as long as Craig is still in it). <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Pans Labyrinth<br />
<br />
The movie so nice, I saw it twice! .... (barfs), ugh.. thats no good. Lemme try again...<br />
<br />
Better bring a roadmap! Cuz youll got lost with emotion in Pans Labyrinth! ... BLECH, Im not good at coming up with those lines that make headlines. Lemme just be honest and say that the movie is fockin amazing (try and print THAT,  USA Today!).<br />
<br />
Its basically a fairy tale, a version of Alice in Wonderland for adults (I dont think this would make a very good kids movie). Ive seen this movie pigeon-holed into so many weird classifications  (horror, suspense), but Id put it simply as a fantasy movie (bordering on war movie almost). The acting is WICKED good in this movie. Every actor handles his or her role with perfection. The special effects used in the movie are also nothing short of perfect in that you never see them as special effects. <br />
<br />
I love how the director creates two worlds and uses violence not as dressing to the movie, but more to make us fearful of one of those worlds (just as the heroine becomes fearful of one). As far as fantasy movies go, Id put this right up there with Lord of the Rings. Its really that good. The movie will easily win Best Foreign Language Film at this years Oscars. Go and see it while you still can (make sure you see it in its original Spanish soundtrack too!). <br />
<br />
<br />
1.	The Queen<br />
<br />
Definitely not the type of movie I expected to make my number one of the year, thats for sure. But the truth is, the only person that wouldnt absolutely love this movie is one that doesnt especially like Tony Blair. I can see THAT person not liking this movie. Other than him/her, theres nothing not to love about this amazing movie. (Although come to think of it, maybe Mapleman wouldnt like it. And just for saying that hell once again give my article a crappy rating, grrrr...)<br />
<br />
Someone remind me to talk to 2nd Lt. Cabbage about this movie. I dunno if he saw it or not but I wonder if he liked it as much as I did. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Helen Mirrens performance is incredible. Shes got like an autowin for the Best Actress Oscar. And typically movies with one stellar performance have a storyline that falls by the wayside (North Country, Monster) but not so in this case. The movie is really triumphant. In fact, its a masterpiece both in terms of comedy and in writing. <br />
<br />
The basic premise is to follow what happened to the Royal Family during the week after Princess Diana died. Basically, the Queen fell out of favour quickly among her subjects because she failed to show any real remorse at the passing of Princess Diana (the Peoples Princess). Furthermore, Tony Blair is elected to office and is this young charismatic Prime Minister who the people identify more with than the Royal Family (basically a clash of tradition and informality). Anyway, the movie goes off in all sorts of directions with that and its a fun ride. Theres very little plot to the film but it gives so much running space for actors to really strut their stuff that the movie becomes a full blown character study. <br />
<br />
So even though it has no real shot at winning Best Picture, for me it was easily the best picture of 2006. Not to be missed. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
So there you have my top ten of 2006. All in all, it really wasnt a year void of great movies. Its just that they all came at the very end which left us with a long empty year of anything really fantastic to watch. I hope this isnt a trend that will continue as high quality movies go for late year release dates in order to up their chances at the Oscars. That would simply not do at all. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Hope you liked the read!<br />
