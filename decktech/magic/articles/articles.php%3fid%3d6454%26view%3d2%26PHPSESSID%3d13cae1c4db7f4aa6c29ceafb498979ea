My pick Zelda - I don&#39;t know how the little effimanate Link does it, but he cruises past the X-wings - Maybe it has something to do with the Tri-force being better than the regular old force.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Zelda</i></b></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>This is a rather easy one. Zelda is a classic, with each game being good to great (of course, all memories of the CDi have been expunged). The first two Rogue Squadrons were amazing, with the 3rd being dragged down to mediocre because of the lame on foot missions, but it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the Zelda series.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Zelda</i></b></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>Fitting matchup for Rogue Squadron, which juuuussssst squeaked in.mostly based on warm, fuzzy feelings from the Gamecube launch.<br><br>This is a mis-match in every sense of the word.  Zelda games are mega blockbuster events on any platform they are released on.  Rogue Squadron showed us that Star Wars licensed games could be real gems, but the third installment faltered when it included some ill-advised ground missions.  The title sold so poorly that it essentially killed the franchise dead.<br><br>Dont get me wrongRogue Squadron is good.  But against a heavyweight like Zelda, its no contest.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Zelda</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br><br />
This pairing is the toughest for me to judge. I love both franchises deeply and passionately (yes, passionately). I didn&#39;t fall in love with Zelda until Wind Waker but when I did I fell for it HARD. Rogue Squadron, however, was the only reason I ever got a N64 and a Gamecube. It was such a killer launch app that it drew me into the next generation console each time it was released.<br><br>Zelda has been around longer but Rogue Squadron is Star Wars. Since Star Wars isn&#39;t present anywhere else in this series, I take it that Star Wars as a video game franchise is almost included by default under Rogue Squadron.<br><br>Although I&#39;m sure most judges will vote for Zelda by default (and given that it&#39;s widely agreed that Ocarina of Time is the best video game of all time), I&#39;m going to have to go against the grain and vote for Rogue Squadron. I truly believe that Rogue Squadron and Star Wars in general is a sexier video game franchise and a better one. It came directly after someone wonder after playing the opening level of Shadows of the Empire, &quot;What if I could fly over that ridge?&quot; It was the most fun aerial combat simulator I&#39;ve ever played and the fact that I bought 2 of this series and only 1 of the Zelda series gives me reason to think that I far prefer Rogue Squadron. And since i&#39;m a judge, I&#39;m supposed to vote for how I feel and think.<br><br>And in this, I believe that Rogue Squadron is the better franchise regardless of sales.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Rogue Squadron</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br><br />
This is a mismatch from the get go, as most 1 vs 16 matches are.<br><br>Zelda is iconic. Rogue Squadron, not so much.(Star Wars franchises not withstanding of course) Rogue Squadron games are fun and graphically pretty, but that usually doesn&#39;t get people lining up on release day to get a copy.<br><br>Zelda since day one, has been almost the perfect blend of gameplay, graphics, story, and fun. There have been a few minor hiccups along the way, but nothing to detract from the entire franchise.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Zelda</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br><br>I do believe there is no contest here: Zelda wins. Even though I&#39;ve never really enjoyed Zelda games, I can appreciate what they are. I generally found them to be too easy of games(especially anything from Ocarina to the present). Regardless, the Rogue Squadron games were far from spectacular.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Zelda</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents verdict: I&#39;m pretty sure there aren&#39;t any girls in Rogue Squadron. You aren&#39;t even Luke Skywalker generally, who at least got SOME play (even if it was his hot sister). Zelda, on the other hand, always has Zelda, and upstanding royalty always has TONS of repressed sexual energy... which is just waiting to be unleashed<br />
on the first guy to save the kingdom.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Zelda</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (1) Zelda defeats (16) Rogue Squadron by a vote of 6-1.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><br><b><h3>MATCHUP #2:<br>(8) Metroid vs. (9) Mega Man</h3></b><br><br><p><b>BOOTH:</b><br>Mega Man - By a hair - Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love me some Metroid, but Mega Man&#39;s just got the &quot;something&quot; up it&#39;s sleeve. And some serious staying power as the franchise has adapted to today&#39;s kids - I&#39;ll bet no one else reviewing this has any idea what&#39;s up with the Nt thing and the head to head battling port they did for Gameboy - It&#39;s just that both games are about running around and getting weapons powerups to get to new areas and solve puzzles/beat bosses. Mega Man did it with more stuff, more bosses, and ultimately out evolved Metroid.<br>Plus, Samus is a chick.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Mega Man</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Hmm, the <br />
Blue Bomber vs Samus. The original games are both classics. Metroid with it&#39;s expansive explorations adventures and Mega Man with it&#39;s fun actions, surprising strategy, and hardness. It is a tough call, both have affected games today. I love Mega Man, with its crazy names and somewhat nonlinearity. However, Metroid has adapted to the times, with the Prime series taking it to the next generation, whereas the Battle Network series seems to have bastardized the classic series (along with flooding us with titles). But it does not beat the classic Metroids combined with the amazing Prime series.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>BATTLE OF THE ARM-CANNONS!<br><br>Though the two found themselves seeded close together, in my mind this is another lopsided contest.<br><br>Mega Man was once a great franchise, it really was.  I remember playing &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; years ago and was just floored.  Ditto for 3, though after that the NES installments got more bizarre and just weaker in general.  Mega Man X was a nice shot in the arm during the SNES era, but after that the franchise got mired in poor 3-D installments, Network Battle Pokemon-inspired garbage, and cameos in fighting games.  Looking back, I can honestly say Ive truly enjoyed exactly 4 of the Mega Man games (including the excellent Mega Man for Gameboy from way back when).<br><br>With Metroid, this is a franchise that can seemingly do no wrong.  The original had me spending the night at a friends house just to play it.  The Super NES version is legendary and is in my top 10 games of all time easily.  And even when it seemed like the franchise would lose its way, out come the two stellar Metroid Prime entries.  Its simply no contest for me.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>This is a very close one if I had to look at it objectively.<br><br>Luckily, I can look at this subjectively and vote for Metroid. I think it&#39;s a better franchise and one that will live on far longer than Mega <br />
Man. I&#39;m not going to write much on this cuz I care very little for either franchise in general.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>Interesting factoid for this matchup - Mega Man holds over a 4 to 1 advantage in game apperances (over 100 for MM to around 25 for Samus Aran)<br><br>This one looks like Mega Man should run away with it based on games and other appearances(TV, comics, etc), but it all boils down to quality over quantity. Once you get past Mega Man 2 or 3, the games become pretty much, &quot;insert 8 villians with goofy powers, that you have to beat in a certain order, because one bad guy&#39;s weapon is the weakness of the next guy, then beat Dr. Wiley again&quot;. The Mega Man X series gave this franchise a face lift, but quickly falls into the same pattern as the original series.<br><br>Metroid on the other hand made major improvements from game to game and released the almost flawless Super Metroid. Then they skipped a console generation and evolved into the realm of 3-D to take advantage of new technology and gaming tastes.<br><br> Mega-Man loses for staying stuck in the past and being repetitive.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br>This one is tough, but I&#39;ll give the edge to Metroid for it better adapting to current generation consoles than Mega Man. Mega Man has a ton of iterations(Battle Network, X and Zero series, RPG, etc), but a lot of them followed the same formula, and when the strayed from that, it was rarely better than mediocre. Metroid was a huge game on the NES, Super Metroid was great on the SNES, then when it came to transition to Gamecube... it made the leap and excelled. It also has been fairly successful on portables.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents verdict: Mega Man is a robot who can&#39;t have sex. Metroid stars a tall blonde hottie in power armor who has a serious case of penis envy.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Metroid</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (8) Metroid defeats (9) Mega Man by a vote of 6-1.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><b><h3>MATCHUP #3:<br>(5) Grand Theft Auto vs.(12)Halo</h3><br><br><br></b><p><b>BOOTH:</b><br>Halo...but that&#39;s from personal experience - I never saw the GTA games as much more than a suboptimal FPS engine with general thuggery sidestories thrown in. Halo is the FPS mutliplayer of it&#39;s generation - People still hold Halo parties in my old &#39;hood. Plus, Halo is the Red Vs. Blue engine and that rawks.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Halo</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Hmm, this is a bit tough, especially since I don&#39;t own a system to play either of these games. Halo is fun, but it did not revolutionize the the FPS, or even add much to the genre. Despite GTA&#39;s questionable content, the free style play is great, and you can see it&#39;s influences in a lot of games.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Grand Theft Auto</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br><br />
Heres a meaty early battle of two heavyweights...<br><br>Halo is a fantastic game, a rare gem in the crowded Me Too! first person shooter genre.  The first game was so good that it single-handedly moved Xbox systems during a time when there was little else to play (leading for many to joke that their Xboxes were expensive Halo TV adapters).  Halo 2 continued the excellence, improving the game in almost every way and providing more incredible multi-player networked battles.  It took quite some time for a title to rise up and dethrone Halo 2 from the King of Xbox Live throne.<br><br>Then theres Grand Theft Auto.  Whereas I see Halo as being a refinement of the first person shooter genre, continuing to improve on the immersion offered by titles like Half Life while also focusing on the greta multiplayer battle, I see GTA as being something that turned out to be revolutionary.<br><br>After all, Halo is all in all another FPS game.  A great, even legendary one, but still just a FPS all the same.  GTA on the other hand introduced the world to a true sandbox experience, and games such as Saints Row, Driver, and The Getaway have all been trying to ape it, to capture that same lighting in a bottle all with varying degrees of success.<br><br>Easily the toughest matchup in this first part of the bracket. Its a very slight edge, but Ive got to go with GTA here.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Grand Theft Auto</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>Two big names. One clear winner: HALO.<br><br>Although GTA brought one cool new gametype to consoles, HALO is one of the best FPS&#39;s of all time and sold very expensive and clunky controller consoles all on its own. Halo 2 did not fail to deliver the mail either. And you can bet your bottom dollar that Halo 3 will be THE game next holiday season. And with the recent spawn move to not only a RTS-type of game with Halo Wars, but also the move to the big screen (whereas WARS: The Mumon Rift was unable to do), you know that Halo is an unbeatable video game franchise. Very hot stuff. Halo ftw.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Halo</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>Grand Theft Auto(GTA) almost single-handedly ushered in the &quot;sandbox&quot; game revolution. Plus it made it fun to be a criminal and beat up hooker for her money. Although it also gained notority for being at the forefront of every violent game discussion. Halo is just another first person shooter, albeit a very good one. While it made a lot of people simultaneously curse and praise Microsoft for various reasons, its overreaching impact is not as big as <br />
GTA.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Grand Theft Auto</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br>This is a tough one... but I&#39;m going to have to go with Grand Theft Auto. It completely revolutionized sandbox games with GTA3, and has so many clones(True Crime, Saints Row, etc). For as much as I love Halo, GTA has had a bigger impact on gaming as a whole in my opinion.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Grand Theft Auto</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents verdict: In GTA, you can hire a hooker, than beat her to get your money back. In Halo, you can&#39;t.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Grand Theft Auto</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (5) Grand Theft Auto defeats (12) Halo by a vote of 5-2.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><b><h3>MATCHUP #4:<br>(4) Street Fighter vs. (13) Sonic the Hedgehog</h3></b><br><br><p><b>BOOTH:</b></br>Street Fighter. I am so bad at it. But I know that Ryu and Ken kick Sonic and Knuckles to the curb.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Street Fighter</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>This is an interesting match up. Street Fighter vs the &quot;anti&quot; Mario. Both are great games, and the key games still hold up well (Sonic & SF II). I enjoyed beating up and electrocuting people with Blanka. However, it doesn&#39;t beat the fun of running top speed through crazy levels. Hopefully, the Sonic game for Wii will bring this back.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Sonic</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>In my mind, as good as Sonic once was he has really lost his way in recent years.  His two entries on the Dreamcast were solid outings, but by following in the Adventure format caused it to lose its focus on quick, action-packed gameplay.<br><br>But still, Sonic has been in some quality games, not the least of which was Sonic CDfew got to try it due to the horrible fiasco that was the Sega CD, but it has since been released as part of a Sonic compilation, so you owe it to yourself to check it out if you havent already.<br><br>Street Fighterman, I dont even know where to start.  It has been cited with saving arcades, at least for awhile in the early 90s.  It has spawned quality anime, tons of great titles, a pathetic excuse for a live-action film, and has tested the mettle of gamers the world over for years.  Fact is, there are few fighting games that deserve to stand toe to toe with either Street Fighter 2: Turbo or Street Fighter Alpha 3.<br><br>I love the little blue hedgehog, but in this case he just gets a hearty Dragon Punch for his trouble.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Street Fighter</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>Ugh..another non-exciting match up. Which do I hate less? Street Fighter. I&#39;ll never forget being so underwhelmed by a game as I was with Sonic. Both as a kid playing it and being bored to death and even as an adult playing the horrific latest Sonic installment. For my birthday in 2005, my mother-in-law bought my the Sonic Collection for Gamecube. I gave it back to her and said, <br />
&quot;Please get me RE4 instead. That way I&#39;ll actually really like your gift.&quot; Being given Sonic was like being given a Sony Playstation console or a Union Jack to fly over my house. No thanks.<br><br>Street Fighter, on the other hand, was a really fun series and brought me to the arcade in college where I&#39;d do my best with Dhalsim and Chun Li to beat all the Asian students who were unbeatable with Ken or Ryu. I never actually had that much fun at an arcade before and when a Street Fighter II was set up in my college, WOW. Winner stays, loser pays, and no one <br />
studies!<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Street Fighter</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>Honestly, another lopsided match. Sonic has been and will always be Mario-lite and that&#39;s giving them too much credit. There is only so much enjoyment that can be had by making a little blue ball go very fast. Street Fighter on the other hand was the pinnalce of fighting games, especially in the early years. I think it has suffered some by mainly sticking staying in the 2D realm, but it was the preminent arcade fighting game for a long time.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Street Fighter</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br>Can I vote for neither? I suppose if forced to pick, I&#39;d go with Sonic, since it was the face of Sega, even though neither is much of anything at the moment.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Sonic</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents verdict: In the most rececnt Sonic game, Sonic gets kissed by a girl. HAWT.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Sonic</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (4) Street Fighter defeats (13) Sonic the Hedgehog by a vote of 4-3.  Photo finish!</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><b>PAIRINGS FROM THIS ROUND AND FINAL THOUGHTS:</b><br><br>Looks like in the next round, we&#39;ll have the following matchups resulting from the top half of the brackets:<br><br>(1)Zelda versus (8) Metroid<br><br>(5)Grand Theft Auto versus (4)Street Fighter<br><br><br><br><i>Wow...those are the definition of tough matchups! Mario of course cruised to victory, no surprise as how Rogue Squadron just barely made the cut...Metroid maybe got a favorable pairing in the first round, but now has to deal with a fellow Big &quot;N&quot; heavyweight in the form of the fat plumber himself....I&#39;m shocked that GTA won as handily as it did over Halo...and I&#39;m equally shocked at how close the vote was between Street Fighter and Sonic.  Now in the next round, you get the pioneer of the &quot;do anything&quot; style of game versus the <br />
game that engineered the fighting game explosion...</i><br><br><br>Thanks for reading, and look for the results of the second half of the first bracket soon!<br><br><br><b>Ken Bradford</b><br>Decktech Admin<br><br><br>With BIG thanks to our judges!<br />
