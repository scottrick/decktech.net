Castelvania: The best side-scroller series EVER vs. the best action horror title. Simon Belmont whips Salazar&#39;s hiney FTW. <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Castlevania</i></b></p><br><br><br />
<p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Ooh, a tough one. My experiences with Vania are more towards the recent portable games, though I did play Castlevania 64, and thought it was okay. Now, I enjoyed the RE series once it came to the cube. The REmake scared the hell out of me. However, RE4 is what is going to push it over the top for me. The adrenaline rush of the new games beats out the fun dungeon exploration of Castlevania.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Resident Evil</i></b></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>Heh...well, this one&#39;s going to be a no-contest for me.  For Resident Evil, I was first in line to pick up a copy of part I.  I was a dirt-poor college student and ended up trading a ton of Gameboy carts for it (this was when you could get $5 credit for GB carts as part of some Electronics Boutique promotion).<br><br>I took it home, and while many parts of the game just scared the crap out of me...the dogs, the spider, the shark...I found myself MORE frustrated with the controls as time went on.  As the need for precision <br />
increased, so too did my frustration with the game.  As a result, I never finished the title, nor did I bother to purchase any future installments.<br><br>Castlevania...my experiences could&#39;ve be any more different.  I think the first time I played a Castlevania game was when I was very young...it was in a PX arcade with the &quot;Nintendo VS.&quot; arcade cabinet.  After my initial play, the second time I was able to play straight through...to you know the spot...Medusa heads, platforms, stairwells...poof, to my <br />
doom.<br><br>The quality of the Castlevania titles kept coming, and even with a terrible forray into 3-D (something they insist on keeping with for the regular console entries), the stellar 2-D Symphony of the Night was proof that the 2-D incarnation of the series still had life even after 2-D was pronounced dead on the scene.<br><br>RE4 may be a turning point for the RE franchise, but we&#39;ll see.  Meanwhile, quality GBA Castlevania titles just keep coming, so RE still has some catching up to do.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Castlevania</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br><br />
As cool as Castlevania was in the day (NES), I feel like this franchise lost its gusto as time went on. The upcoming release of Super Castlevania IV for the Wii will determine if this franchise can get back on top. But given the almost 20 Castlevania titles that have released over the years, Ive never been overly moved by this series. I hear most of this franchises strong points are being shown in handheld console games (with the exception of <br />
Symphony of the Night for PS which is widely considered the best of the best in this series).<br><br>Whereas Resident Evil just keeps getting better and better. Resident Evil 4 is easily the best game Ive ever played and Resident Evil 1 is easily the scariest. Where Castlevania has released almost 20 games over the <br />
years, Resident Evil has released almost 30. And the upcoming Resident Evil 5 has far more anticipation than Super Castlevania IV. The teaser trailer for Resident Evil 5 left my mouth watering for more.<br><br>The Resident Evil franchise has even spawned a couple of movies (one of which was good) and RE3 is surely in production by now. Its such a sexy franchise given its components (evil corporation + zombies + mutated monsters = me rikey breadsticks!).<br><br>This judges vote is clearly for Resident Evil. A beast of a franchise that is no where close to being extinguished. Theres still plenty of gas in Umbrellas engine, baby.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Resident Evil</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>No offense to RE fans, but one good game does not make a franchise good. While people say that RE 4 is a must play game, I never heard anyone say that about other games in the series.<br><br>Castlevania, while not exactly having people say &quot;this is a must play&quot;, has produced quite a few quality games. While I have bashed other games for staying in 2D and not shaking the formula up, for some reason it works for Castlevania. In fact the few negatives that have ever been heard about this franchise are when it tried to evolve into the 3D realm. While I have no doubt that a 3D Castelvania could now be made and be decent quality, staying in the 2D make this game retain it&#39;s original appeal. <br><br><b><i>VOTE: Castlevania</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br><br />
Castlevania in a landslide. I hated all Resident Evils prior to RE4 due to terrible controls and an even worse camera. Castlevania started out as a good platformer on the NES, had a few sequels, and then carried to the SNES in Super Castlevania which was great. Even though it failed in the transition to 3D on N64 and PS2, it still was strong on the PS1 in Symphony of the Night(critically <br />
acclaimed as the &quot;last great 2d platformer&quot;) and on the GBA and DS.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Castlevania</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br><br />
Serpents Verdict: Castlevania started out as a somewhat standard sidescrolling action game, but quickly began to borrow elements from rpgs and metroid, eventually settling on being extrememly fun &#39;castletroid&#39; games. However, if Castlevania had never existed, the world of gaming would be largely the same as we know it today.<br><br> <br />
Resident Evil invented the survival horror genre, spawned books and movies, lightgun games, and then reinvented itself as an action survival horror game. Resident Evil 1 was a system selling game on the PS1 and Resident Evil 2 improved on the game, brought us Leon and Ada, and also introduced the genre to fans of the Nintendo 64. And of course, Resident Evil 4.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Resident Evil</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT:  (3) Castlevania defeats (14) Resident Evil by a vote of 4-3.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><br><b><h3>MATCHUP #6:<br>(6)Final Fantasy vs. (11) Mortal Kombat</h3></b><br><br><p><b>BOOTH:</b><br><br />
Final Fantasy - I bet most gamers could measure the time they&#39;ve spent on Squares signature RPG series in terms of months vs. a week. I know it took me 40+ hrs. of game play to beat FFVII. And then I did it again. I wish they had a clock for the time I sent on the Super NES version. Mortal Kombat did at least have the realy hot chick from Billy Madison (Bridgette Wilson) as Sonya in the first movie though! <br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Now, I will be truthful, I have not played a lot of MK (thanks mom). Not a huge fan of the later, post VI Final Fantasies either (X was okay). The old ones, however, are great. And with the re-releases on the GBA and DS, I am experiencing most now. MK was a fun fighting game, with some cool characters (I love Scorpian). However, Final Fantasy I is a game I can&#39;t stop replaying, and II & III are also quit fun. Final Fantasy is definately a classic game.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>While I used to carry fistfuls of quarters to the arcade to play Mortal Kombat, and also used to trade fatalities for the incredible Part II, going to freakish levels to memorize all the moves and finishers for the game...<br><br>There is no comparison to Final Fantasy.  I can&#39;t count the hours spent on playing these great games.  I&#39;ll admit...3-D Final Fantasy hasn&#39;t been the same for me, and I&#39;m in <br />
general bewilderment with the direction they&#39;ve gone with <br />
XII...but honestly, Mortal Kombat was a cup of coffee compared to the time I&#39;ve sunk into FF games.<br><br>FF games popularized the console RPG genre to a degree that no one could have imagined.  The games themselves are system sellers.  Mortal Kombat I moved some Genesis systems, and ditto Part III for Playstation, but it&#39;s been awhile since MK could claim to truly be &quot;relevant&quot;.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</p></i></b><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>I think the only thing Ive ever liked out of Final Fantasy was the rendering of Donald Sutherlands character in the animated movie. Other than that, I really dont see what the big deal is with this RPG series. I cant believe its still going given what other RPGs have and are accomplishing. Still, its impressive that Final Fantasy has managed to spew out more than 30 titles. With upcoming <br />
titles coming for the PS3 and Wii, there is still much life left in this franchise as well. Especially after two of the franchises strongest releases, FF XII and X, were released in a previous generation console (PS2).<br><br>Mortal Kombat, however, was <br />
another ground breaking franchise. Someone decided they really liked Street Fighter II and decided to make it more visceral. At the same time as Street Fighter II arcade machines were added to my college, so too was a Mortal Kombat machine. Scorpion was SO much fun to play for me. I feel like this franchise really lost footing after the first Mortal Kombat. I havent enjoyed a single Mortal Kombat since the first. I cant believe that there has now <br />
been around 40 Mortal Kombat titles. The best of which is probably Deadly Alliance. I think this is a dyring franchise but I would vote for this over Final Fantasy.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Mortal Kombat</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>Final Fantasy is the 3rd best selling franchise of all time, MK is 20th. The Final Fantasy games(main series mostly) have inspired countless geek debate over which one was better. The biggest reason being none of them were true sequels to each other and contained a different story with different characters. Gameplay and graphics are almost always top notch, and the story, while being formulaic at times, was typically compelling. MK, on the other hand, is really only distinguished by being a fighting game that had gruesome finishing moves that really weren&#39;t that spectacular. Many games of the franchise suffered from cheesy move combos and cheating AI and just doesn&#39;t inspire franchise loyalty like FF. <br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br><br />
As much as I hate RPGs, I have to admit that Final Fantasy wins this one. Simply too many titles and fans to deny it... <br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents Verdict: Mortal Kombat started out as the first &#39;Street Fighter clone&#39; without actually being a clone. Looking back, Mortal Kombat 1 was an awful game -- it&#39;s selling points were the digital graphics and bloody fatalaties. The game came into it&#39;s own with Mortal Kombat 2 however. MK2 was one of the first fighting games to use &#39;juggles&#39; for combos; was packed with tons of secret moves, characters, and easter eggs; full of inside jokes from the staff; and of course, many over the top fatalities. The game had an overarching storyline which has continued to this day, and spawned two movies. However, Mortal Kombat quickly faded as 3D fighters came to the fore, and the fighting genre began to die down in general.<br><br>However, Final Fantasy practically invented the console RPG genre (along with Dragon Quest), and saved Squaresoft from going bankrupt and later going on to create many high selling franchises. Final Fantasy 4 introduced real storylines to video games, Final Fantasy 6 may have been the first game without a protagonist, the movement of Final Fantasy 7 from the N64 to the PS1 was possibly the &#39;turning point&#39; of when the PS1 became a <br />
legitamate competitor, and Final Fantasy 10 was the first &#39;story based&#39; console game to heavily use voice acting. The series has also spawned two movies, action-rpg games (Crystal Chronicles), tactics-rpg games (Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance), and is heavily featured in Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. <br><br><b><i>VOTE: Final Fantasy</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (6) Final Fantasy defeats (11) Mortal Kombat by a vote of 6-1.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><b><h3>MATCHUP #7:<br>(7) Metal Gear vs. (10) John Madden Football </h3><br><br><br></b><p><b>BOOTH:</b><br>Madden - Solid <br />
Snake is spotted as John Madden blabs on and gives his postion away to the terrorists. &quot;You see, what Snake is trying to do hear is sneak up on the guy. When he gets there, first he&#39;ll do a wham, and maybe sometimes, a bam - that almost as good as crash, or a boom. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to have a lead, cuz if you have a lead, and the game ends, you win!&quot; <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Madden</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Metal Gear. At least the different games are seperate games. What really seperates each yearly Madden title. That, and I hate the monopoly on the NFL license.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Metal Gear</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>Looking at this matchup made me really evaluate how I feel about the Metal Gear Solid franchise.  I got hooked on the NES one (though the difficulty was off the charts!) and the PS1 &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was incredible on pretty much every level.<br><br>However, Part 2 I never really got into, and Part 3--despite my best efforts--also just hasn&#39;t had the same impact on me.  I&#39;m not sure why...maybe I don&#39;t enjoy worrying about camo all the time, or eating rotten snake meat, or whatever...I just don&#39;t know.<br><br>Madden...well, I must admit I just don&#39;t like the exclusive NFL license, because let&#39;s face it, NFL 2k5 really was a better game than Madden 05.  EA responded as only it could by using its cash to lock out the competition, and all gamers suffer when that happens.<br><br>BUT...<br><br>How much time have I spent playing Madden?  We used to have huge tournaments amongst my friends and I way back in the SNES/Genesis days.  I&#39;ve owned Madden for the SNES (2 versions), the Saturn (the not-so-good 97 edition), Playstation 1 (&#39;99), Gamecube (&#39;02), Playstation 2 (&#39;03), and the XBox (&#39;06).  I&#39;ve also played it on the Genesis, Nintendo 64, and the 360.  And <br />
I can&#39;t wait for next year&#39;s version, where the incredible rookie crop of &#39;06 will be represented in full force (with the appropriate skill rankings).<br><br>And let&#39;s not get into the Wii version, which looks to take the franchise in a completely exciting new direction...<br><br>Madden wins, and it&#39;s not even as close as I&#39;d thought it would be.<br><br><b><i>VOTE: Madden</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>Not being a fan of sports games to begin with and even less of a fan of American football, this one is a no brainer for me. However, lets go through some logic so I can pretend that I actually thought about this one.<br><br>I think Madden games are one of the only demos out there that I never spend more than 20 seconds playing. I get so insanely bored with these games, I cant even begin to <br />
explain it. And its not like I hate football completely. Tecmo Bowl for the NES was one of my favourite games back in the day. I have to admit that Im impressed that Madden has come out with nearly 70 games. This is one heck of a strong franchise. But then again, they made three Santa Clause movies too. So strength in numbers isnt all that. But this franchise has shown recent strength on the previous generation (PS2 and GC) with the release of Madden 2002, 2003 and 2004. All of which were very well liked by players and critics alike. I can respect Madden as a franchise but I still cant enjoy these games at all.<br><br>Metal Gear with barely 15 titles is a much smaller franchise but in this case, Ill go for quality over quantity. The upcoming MGS 4 : Guns of the Patriots for the PS3 will surely be a colossal hit and bring this franchise back to the forefront where it was used to being <br />
during the PS2s strong days. This franchise even translates well to hand-held consoles. Metal Gear Solid for the GameBoyColour (haha Ken, coloUr), is widely considered one of the best Metal Gears if not handheld console games ever. I look forward to hearing more from this franchise and I hope they eventually branch out of the Playstation consoles to include the Wii and especially <br />
the Xbox360.<br><br>This judge easily votes Metal Gear as the superior franchise in terms of video game quality. <br />
<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Metal Gear Solid</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b></i><br>This one is going to be pretty short.<br><br>Metal Gear Sold was a huge hit, MGS 2 was such let down. My interest in MG has gone away since then. Madden wins for getting suckers to line up once a year to buy virtually the same game as they just bought last year.<br><br>Truthfully, I miss the days of Tecmo Super Bowl. The new sports game do nothing for me.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Madden</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br>Madden is one of the best selling games of all time(or THE best selling? I&#39;m not sure). It sells millions of copies every year, and people skip work on its release day. It seems to be slacking a bit as of late, but it&#39;s still a quality football game.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Madden</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SERPENT</b><br>Serpents Verdict: You can poke a girly poster in Metal Gear Solid 2 and it goes &#39;boing!&#39; <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Metal Gear Solid</b></i></p><br><br><br><b>THE FINAL VERDICT: (10) John Madden Football defeats (7) Metal Gear in an upset by a vote of 4-3.</b><br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br><br><br />
<b><h3>MATCHUP #8:<br>(2) Mario vs. (15) Gran Turismo </h3></b><br><br><p><b>BOOTH:</b></br>Mario blows by a very realistic looking Porsche boxster. Very realistic Boxster is no match for a banana peel. Game over.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Mario</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>SITHBORG279:</b><br>Oh god, this is amazingly easy. A series responsible for video games lasting to the current gen vs a game I LOATHE. No doubt, GT has pretty graphics, realistic physics, and tons of cars. If you are a car guy, I am sure it is a good game for you. My friends loved this game. We used to get together, and they would just play this, usually in 1 player mode. It was rather boring. And I prefer more arcadey racing, like Mario Kart. That is a fun racing game. To me, GT doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to the classic Mario Bros game. <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Mario</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>KEN B.:</b><br>Wow...I&#39;m going to save my breath here.  I&#39;ve never been more than a casual fan of Gran Turismo, the series that wants to have it both ways...&quot;realistic&quot; driving while allowing cars to &#39;bump&#39; off walls or each other without suffering a crash.<br><br>It&#39;s embrassing at how much more fun games like Burnout are than Gran Turismo.  I realize I&#39;m in the minority on that one, but not in the minority of those who would think that GT has any sort of actual shot at Mario.<br><br>Mario brought the gaming world back from the &quot;Crash of &#39;83&quot;, and he&#39;s been moving systems ever since.  Mario 64 was probably a full 8 years ahead of <br />
the curve, there have been plenty of would-be 3-D platformers that still haven&#39;t achieved the excellence of that title.  Easy vote here.<br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Mario</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>PATRICK M.S.:</b><br>Wow, talk about David vs the Goliath. And Im not even sure who is who in this one. Talking about Gran Turismo in this case is like talking at Jim Hensens funeral the same day <br />
that Sammy Davis Jr died. But lets still try and recognize a few good things about Gran Turismo before we vote for Mario (I wonder if any judge will not vote for Mario in this pairing?).<br><br>Im wondering how the heck Gran Turismo made this contest given the franchises paltry FIVE titles (thats including the much forgotten title for the DreamCast). Thats barely enough to consider it a franchise. All four Gran Turismos were excellent games but it still doesnt really have much identity as a <br />
franchise. There is still no planned title for the PS3 but perhaps if and when it is released, it might bring much attention to this series that only lives in the Sonys universe.<br><br>Whereas Mario ah Mario. What a service you and your brother have done for console gaming. You might be surprised to learn that only 50-some odd titles exist in the Mario universe (counting the Kart games and everything), yet there isnt a soul in North America or Japan who doesnt know what Mario is (whereas Gran Turismo would probably get people thinking its either a type of Piano or italian dessert). So many terrific games have been released from this franchise and what an awesome variety!<br>- Super Mario World<br>- Super Mario 64<br>- Super Mario Kart<br><br />
- Super Mario Sunshine<br>- Mario Tennis<br>- Mario Golf<br> - Paper Mario<br>- Mario Paint<br> <br />
- Dr. Mario<br>- Mario Party<br><br>Yes, from sports games to RPGs, from puzzle games to parlour games, this franchise has done it ALL. And Im not going to even touch what a strong impact this franchise has made on the handheld consoles as well. Mario has the variety, the quality AND the quantity to truly be one of the best video game franchises of all time.<br><br>I vote for Gran Turismo.<br><br> OH WAIT! I clicked on the wrong box! UNDO! UNDO! I vote for Mario instead! <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  <strike>Gran Turismo</strike> .... Mario</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>HAL, ROTN:</b><br>Another David vs Goliah match, with David being a realistic looking car and Goliath being a rotund Italian Plumber.<br><br>GT is another of those game that I never really saw the appeal to. The only reason I even owned one is because it came with the system. I&#39;m not a big fan of <br />
Japanese cars and it really wasn&#39;t until GT3 that you saw any non-Japanese cars and even those were limited. Stupid AI, no damage, and limited car selection really hampered this series.<br><br>Mario, the man, the myth, the savior of console video games. At a time when things looked bleak on the home video game front, a plucky little plumber squashed mushrooms, stepped on turtles, dove into pipes and rescued a princess from a fire breathing dragon. And thus a new era for console gaming was born. Let&#39;s see a Honda Civic compete with that. <br><br><b><i>VOTE:  Mario</b></i></p><br><br><p><b>JEDI GENIUS:</b><br><br />
