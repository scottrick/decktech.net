<br>
now and has mostly concentrated on the newest and best sets (Type II).  I have been playing <br>
<br>
Magic for a very long time and I have always looked at past sets that were before my time to <br>
<br>
see what power they had in the metagame of today.  Example:  If I said Black Summer and you<br>
<br>
 knew of and/or were part of this event, then stop reading this article.  <br>
<br>
     Too many of the younger players come to me with a great new combo that they have just <br>
<br>
discovered with an old card that they found in a collection that they bought only to find out that <br>
<br>
it has been around since the beginnings of Magic (Lure and Craw Giant).  For all of you younger<br>
<br>
players that are reading this and have no idea what these cards are, I suggest going on to <br>
<br>
mtgnews.com and looking them up there.  Anycraze.com is another good site since they tell <br>
<br>
you what the card is in an effort to sell you the card.  <br>
<br>
     Too many people are ignorant of the power of old cards and also where the game has come<br>
<br>
 from to appreciate or hate what the designers are doing to it.  These articles will take you <br>
<br>
through the Ages of Dominaria, until it was destroyed in Apocalypse, and into various other <br>
<br>
Planes such as Jamurra and Rath.  When Magic was first introduced by Richard Garfield, <br>
<br>
it was not called Magic: The Gathering but instead it was called Mana Clash.  The game&#39;s name <br>
<br>
and scheme were changed in a last minute decision and the game was forever changed into <br>
<br>
what we know and love.  <br>
<br>
     The original philosophy for both games was that you and a rival wizard, your opponent, <br>
<br>
would both begin to cast magical spells and summon deadly creatures to fight and die for you <br>
<br>
from various planes of existence.  To many people, myself included, this sounds suspiciously <br>
<br>
like the newest Japanese craze to hit the US, Yu-Gi-Oh!.  The main sets in Magic are based <br>
<br>
around a color scheme that first came about during Mana Clash.  These sets had no basic <br>
<br>
storyline behind them and were mainly designed to give players a feeling of the world of <br>
<br>
Dominaria.  I suppose that I should have mentioned this earlier but Dominaria is the magical <br>
<br>
world that most of the storylines behind Magic through Apocalypse are set.  <br>
<br>
     The early sets such as Arabian Nights and The Dark had Magic developers floundering as <br>
<br>
they tried to design cards that were not too powerful.  This is why so many of these cards were<br>
<br>
 never seen again in any other set.  All older cards in the first years to two years of Magic were <br>
<br>
based around certain themes.  Red focused on all of the deformed mountainous creatures and <br>
<br>
those that lived off of cliffs and giant birds.  The main themes with regard to creatures were <br>
<br>
dragons, rocs, dwarves, goblins, kobolds, and carious giants and other mountainous creatures. <br>
<br>
 Red spells most often dealt with destruction in its many forms such as through Lightning Bolt, <br>
<br>
Disintegrate, and Earthquake.  Blue revolved around the ocean and everything that lived in it.  <br>
<br>
How many players remember seeing a blue mage cast a Merfolk of the Pearl Trident?  Most <br>
<br>
blue decks were designed to try and stall or outright stop the opponent.  From mostly blue is <br>
<br>
where we get the great idea of interrupts.  Two examples of the stall strategy are Counterspell <br>
<br>
and Stasis.  Both cards denied resources an opponent needed to survive, the first denying <br>
<br>
spells and the second denying an untap step.  Blue was also known as the flying and illusionary <br>
<br>
color.  No other color had near the amount of flying creatures that blue did in the early sets and <br>
<br>
this was a prominent aspect that was exploited.  The other advantage blue had was that it could<br>
<br>
change the color of things at will as well as animate objects.  Green dealt with nature and all of <br>
<br>
the natural occurrences in Dominaria.  All of its creatures could be found in the forest or in <br>
<br>
nature.  Most of its spells dealt with growth and making things extremely big.  There were also <br>
<br>
some natural phenomenon such as twisters and hurricanes.  Green was not able to stand on <br>
<br>
its own when Magic began due to its lack of anything that was not a big creature or creature <br>
<br>
enhancer.  Green was however able to produce large amounts of mana very quickly through <br>
<br>
elves, birds of Paradise, Wild Growth, Channel and others.  Many of the other creatures that <br>
<br>
started out in green were gigantic bemoths that cost outrageous amounts of mana even for <br>
<br>
green.  Green also did not have access to many types of destruction and was left on the short <br>
<br>
end of the stick.  It could not stop or hold back anything.  The color balance between black and <br>
<br>
white will be discussed in the next article.<br>
<br>
There were also nine cards known as the &quot;Power Nine&quot; and should have been run in any deck.  <br>
<br>
They were the five Moxes, Black Lotus, Timewalk, Timetwister, and Ancestral Recall.  These <br>
<br>
cards were extremely broken.  In the first few sets, you saw combinations such as Black Lotus <br>
<br>
and Juzam Djinn on the first turn.  Most of what was created had a balance somewhere, usually<br>
<br>
in an opposite color.  You had a fairly accurate idea of which colors went together because of <br>
<br>
the amount of multicolored ideas that were had.  There were a lot of ideas for each color to <br>
<br>
have its own version, such as Ivory Cup, Iron Star, Throne of Bone, and others.  There was also <br>
<br>
a belief that each color should have a 3 in it for one mana.  Thus were Healing Salve, Giant <br>
<br>
Growth, Dark Ritual, Ancestral Recall, and Lightning Bolt created.  They were some of the most <br>
<br>
meaningful cards in each color since each effect was designed to best describe that color.  <br>
<br>
	This is the end of the first article.  Please let me know any comments that you have <br>
<br>
about it and try to make your comments constructive so I will know how to better structure the <br>
<br>
next article.<br>
