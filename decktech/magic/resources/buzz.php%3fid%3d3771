I dont take it as a dig. It seems like thats what our country does on a regular basis is to bend other countries to our will.<br />
<br />
Its quite amazing how fast Russia went from being a feared super power to a land of drugs, crime, and corruption and that was based alot on pressure from the US. I dont know if that was the best thing that could happen. I think it happened a little to fast I mean.<br />
<br />
It always seems like we are messing with someone in the overall picture but I guess that is what our government feels is our duty or something. Its crazy.<br />
<br />
Obviously there is a better way and I know we can have peace and get along with everyone(except for most of the Middle East) and someday that may happen.<br />
<br />
Someones always pissed about something though. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Ser Edmund</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">What I think needs to happen is an entire shift of thought.  Today the basis of our liberties depends on the slavery of others.  The dominant middle-class exploits the rich to pay for the government and the poor for cheap labor/goods.  Many of the freedoms men enjoy are thanks to the labor and oppression of women.  But men and Americans aren&#39;t any happier because these liberties are based on oppressing others.<br><br>Today all governments (including the UN) seemed based on this principle of exploiting.  Many of these treaties passed, seem solely for the purpose of inhibiting the US economy, or enforcing US policy (e.g. Korean War). etc.  Maybe when we all get through our heads that happiness cannot be based on the oppression of others, our governments will be able to work togeher in a productive way and stop this political cylce of vengence.  The UN seems to me just another manifestation of the problem, not a solution. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>rayc</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">I think that the ultimate solution is the opposite of isolationism. One of the roots of our problem is that we participate in world affairs by trying to make other nations "bend to our will." (Sorry Judge... that wasn&#39;t a dig at you - I just thought it was a good example of how we tend to approach things.)<br />
<br />
We need to be more a part of the international community, including occasionally subordinating our own economic interests to world interests. As it is now, we enforce the treaties and U.N. resolutions we like with force, even when the rest of the world is asking us to show restraint and we refuse recognize resolutions and treaties that the rest of the world has agreed to. <br />
<br />
I understand that stop-gap measures have to be taken in order to protect ourselves from immediate danger; but ultimately we have to help make the world a better, safer place for everyone in order to make it a better, safer place for ourselves. And we have to do it in a cooperative manner, not by forcing our will on the rest of the world.  </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>The Judge</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">That makes sense to me. I get a little fired up about this stuff and I think patience is the real answer.<br />
<br />
I am one of those that felt like we should get immediate gratification after September 11 and in this day and age it just wont happen. These things take months and months and I still dont feel like we are accomplishing anything but we have to look at the big picture.<br />
<br />
We more or less eliminated Afghanistan aside from sporadic uprisings. Next on our list is Iraq. North Korea after that perhaps? Our list of "enemies" is long and it will take years to bend the worlds "bad guys" to our will.<br />
<br />
Seems like their would be an easier solution. Ive said it before in other threads but I tend to think that if we just leave all these people alone and focus on our own country, the world might be a better place.? Its hard to tell but it seems like we should try that at some point since every country we topple always seems to come back and bite us later.<br />
<br />
I think Im going to go work and then play some cards and try not to think about it so dam much.

One thing&#39;s for sure - any solution is going to require a lot of patience, a long-term plan, commitment to it, and long-term follow-through.  It would be nice if the two parties in this country could work together to create such a plan instead of fighting each other about it and reversing course every 4 or 8 years. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Ser Edmund</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">I agree, no one really knows what to do (except the political elite and weapons manufacturers).

I dont know what we can do. That is certainly another option is just to leave everyone else alone, create our own jobs and economy again and tell everyone else to take a hike. I dont know what is the best thing to do. I dont want my freedoms limited either but those people got in here way to easy so what do you do about it when you cant see it coming.<br />
<br />
Its a hell of a debate and I like the idea of more isolation and not always focking with everyone else but it seems everything the US does has a double edge sword.<br />

The moral: You can&#39;t please all of the people all of the time. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Ser Edmund</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">So let me get this strait Judge, you recognize the futility of trying to identify a terrorist (because really it is impossible, unless the government turns into a terrorist itself like China) yet you want us to be &#39;strict&#39;, but what does that mean, and on what criteria? Should we execute foreign missionaries that sneak past like China? Restricting people is like restricting the flow of ideas, which is horrible and oppressive.  Like someone intelligent pointed out, limiting our borders will just help make a lot of people hate us even more, and since you can&#39;t really tell whose terrorists and whose not...well why make more people suffer? <br><br>Take away our freedoms and others so the US governement can continue to do what its doing? frimbazel no!  Instead of letting less people in, how about we kill less people abroad.  We need to free up the strangle hold the US has on its citizens and the rest of the world, not help it even more (which is exactly what they want).  You clammer about how you hate George Bush and the government yet you want to give them more power...that&#39;s smart. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>The Judge</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Your taking the China thing to far. I just know they are very strict about who they let into the country thats all and that we should also be just as strict if not more since we are a much bigger target than them.<br />
<br />
China is one of the most horrendous places to live on earth and in no way do I think we should be like them except for the border restrictions, at least for a while until we get our own good system of checking people, whether it be cameras, computers, whatever just so we are not letting any old fool in here who will blow up a bus or something.<br />
<br />
It can&#39;t be easy and maybe we are doing everything we can do now. My god the security in a casino is tighter than any airport or ship dock that Ive ever seen. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Weepus</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">Judge, you&#39;re right.  There are probably certain freedoms that we should be willing to give up for the sake of security.  But, putting the Chinese system on a pedestal completely destroys your credibility.  China is an oppressive place to live - we couldn&#39;t have had this discussion in China a few years ago.  Why do you think people from all over the world are willing to abandon their families and their friends to come to America with nothing?  In 99.999% of the cases, it isn&#39;t because they&#39;re terrorists.  People often make the mistake of believing that because they aren&#39;t using their civil rights those civil rights aren&#39;t important.  That&#39;s self-centered, but more importantly it&#39;s wrong.  If you don&#39;t understand why, take an American history class or something.     </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Lt.

Lets assume this is true.  But let&#39;s also add that Israel is also takes very harsh measures against those it believes to be terrorists.  I would argue that this just creates too many more for Israel to keep tabs on.<br />
<br />
Now while turning away the odd Arab at your border is hardly the same as bombing his village with F-16s, I hope you might see that annoying innocents can have more negative effects than you might at first consider.<br />

The Setember 11 suicide people lived only 3 hours away from me right in Florida for like 6 months or longer and led nice quiet lives until that day. Who can you trust?<br />
<br />
Where does one draw the line on our freedoms? Its obviously not up to me but I see people all the time that look just like Mohammed Atta. (if that sounds predjudiced, Im sorry, just trying to make a point) Who is a terrorist and whose not?<br />
<br />
I dont know. Does the FBI know or CIA or MI6 or countless other "intelligence" agencies around the world? 23 more people were killed in Israel the other day by suicide bombers. Israel supposedly has the best intelligence agency in the world!! Just regular people who stumble around everyday until they get the order from their leaders to blow themselves and as many innocent civilians as they can. The Koreans are being much more batant and predictible at least. We can see them coming! You cant see some ordinary Moe who moved to this country 10 years ago and has a business and is just biding his time until he gets the order to walk into the mall with 10 pounds of C4 strapped to his chest thinking he will go to heaven!? What the hell is the world coming to?<br />
<br />
How do you combat that? If we restrict who comes into our country and at least find the ones that dont belong here, I dont see anything wrong with avoiding another catastrophe by doing that.It still might happen but we should be doing anything and everything to avoid it and if that means giving up some freedom until we have a better system in place then so be it.<br />

<br />
I&#39;ll explain further so you can understand although its not real, real tough to figure it out.<br />
<br />
The United States pretty much has open borders. Anyone with a passport (fake or otherwise) can enter our country. Until September 11 that is. We waited until something bad happend before we did anything about it which is so typical. China doesn&#39;t do that in regard to letting people in and out of its country. They are very strict on who they let in, AS THE US SHOULD BE. Get it? Or should I use crayons?<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with me liking China or moving there...grow up and read the post, otherwise dont make stupid comments like that. If you dont understand what someone is saying, why do you comment?<br />
<br />
As for Canada, it is well known that their are terrorist cells all over Canada. Hopefully they will stay there if we are strict about entering the US.<br />
<br />
You people need to realize that we need to give up a few freedoms and tell these people to piss off when they want into the US. We got way to soft and we paid for it with thousands of dead bodies and buildings knocked down. You bleeding hearts ever think of that? You want your freedoms and so do I but I am willing to give up a few so me...you and the rest of us can be protected from crazy people. Where is the logic in saying that I take my freedom for granted? Thats just rediculous. To many people take for granted that we are free...a little to free. We can go anywhere and do almost anything even today, I dont think we are doing all we can do to find these people and you can bet that something else will happen. Maybe not like September 11 but you can bet that the terrorists are not done messing with us so where do you draw the line on freedom. You guys tell me since you apparently are the experts. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Lt.

That was the whole problem, this country was way to free. You dont hear about terrorism in places like China because they dont let anyone out hardly and very few people in and the ones they do let in are checked carefully. That is what we should be doing! Canada is full of terrorists just sitting around waiting for an order and we practically have an open border with them. Only difference is now, is that if you are Middle Eastern you will be profiled, possibly detained, and possibly deported and more power to them!<br />

We should have been doing this long ago, instead we always wait for something bad to happen before we do anything about it.

Actually, I&#39;m more frightened of the abuses of Constitutional rights occurring in the US, at least in the short run.  The "patriot act" that allows our government to arrest anyone they suspect of terrorist activity is especially worrisome.  They don&#39;t need a warrant anymore to search your home.  They don&#39;t need a warrant to arrest you either.  They don&#39;t have to allow you legal counsel if you&#39;re suspected of terrorism, and they don&#39;t even have to allow you contact with the outside world.  Witness the Middle-Eastern immigrants detained without counsel last week and the week before.<br />

Our good friends in the vacation paradise of North Korea have started up their Nuclear program again after agreeing to "freeze" it back in 1994.<br />

This is apparently due to the US forgetting or not wanting to ship them a huge supply of oil.<br />

We have a great history of proping up deplorable third world dictators because they were (and are) friendly to us. A lot of what we are suffering now relates to our support of the Shah of Iran. The Iranians hated us, not because we were infidels but because we armed and supported a repressive regime that ruled by terrorizing its own citizens. So the Shah was eventually overthrown. The revolutionaries took Americans hostage but they were all eventually released alive. And did we learn our lesson? No, we armed another repressive dictator (the evil Mr. Sadam Hussein) so that he could make war on Iran for us. We have done this sort of thing all over the world. Central America, Asia. <br />
<br />
We are not afraid that Sadam will nuke the US. We are afraid that he will nuke or gas our invading armies or our allies (if we still have any after this whole thing gets started). So, in essence, we are just fixing the fight. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s actually my generous interpretation. My cynical take is that GW and the rest of his think tank doesn&#39;t really believe Sadam has any serious weapons of mass destruction but, by making this "statement," he is hoping to convince the world that we are actually afraid that Iraq has such weapons and the we are, therefore, justified in invading. <br />

Nuclear weapons are spreading around the world.  There appears there &#39;might&#39; be evidence of heavy water plants with the purpose of research into nuclear weapons in Iran.  North Korea has a bomb or 4, and within 10 years will be able to produce 50 bombs a year (or something disgusting like that).  Nukes are spreading around the world.<br />
<br />
How long until every country who wants a nuke can get a nuke?  How long until any military organization (including those not affiliated with a ruling government: read, gorillas and terrorists) can get easy access to nukes?<br />
<br />
Unless the USA takes on a MUCH stronger &#39;world police force&#39; type body than it currently is, the above statement is probably inevitable.  Even if they do take on that role, It&#39;s probably inevitable.<br />

Maybe the US should concentrate more on Nuke defenses, despite those agreements saying they can&#39;t (haven&#39;t they already broken those?)

While I&#39;m here, I can&#39;t resist addressing the gem of a quote that TLM responded to below...<br />
<br />
Jaguar says: "How in the world are we going to pay for this idiotic war on terrorism... an equally-idiotic war on drugs, AND carry on a meaningless war with Iraq at the same time? Do the idiots in D.C. think that money grows on trees?"<br />
<br />
First off, any "war" will be paid for the same way every  war in the last 70 years has been paid for -- out of our (the taxpayers&#39;) pockets.  Don&#39;t forget, the 16th Amendment gives the government the right to legally rob you.  "Rob?" you may say.  Yes.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s called when someone else takes your money under threat of phyiscal force.  Think I&#39;m kidding?  Try skipping your income taxes this year and see if the IRS doesn&#39;t throw your arse in jail.  As for the war on terrorism being idiotic... I just don&#39;t see that statement making much sense.  Either we go after these guys and teach them that we&#39;re not going to stand around and take another 9/11 or we don&#39;t.  Personally, I prefer the former.  <br />
<br />
As for the "equally idiotic war on drugs"... well, you have me there.  It is idiotic. =)<br />
<br />
Do the folks on Capitol Hill think money grows on trees?  No, of course not.  It grows out of your wallet, where they can&#39;t wait to get their greedy little hands on it and give it to someone else who didn&#39;t earn it (well, that&#39;s the Democratic philosophy anyway).  Remember, if you&#39;re a liberal, income in this country is not "earned".  It is "distributed".  <br />

All day long for at least three years (and still now), we got to hear politicians and scumbags of the same kind go on and on about the sex scandal, when they could have been dealing with things that matter more, like the situations in Iraq. Because of our pathetic inability to set aside our opinions of things that people do in the privacy of their homes, we inadvertently made oral sex a dinner table discussion."<br />

<br />
1.  Nukes suck.  Period.  Anyone who would truly like to see a nuke dropped on anyone, anywhere should have his head examined.  That said, they&#39;re not going anywhere.  Smile, nod, get over it.  It&#39;s reality.  <br />
<br />
To answer Mike&#39;s question, for me personally, they&#39;re scary as hell.  I work about 8 blocks from the Capitol, in the heart of target city.  So when you suggest to me that Saddam (or anyone else for that matter) might hand over a nuke to a psycho willing to use it as a first-strike weapon, I say we take them out, and send their weapons along for the ride.<br />
<br />
2.  The ship in question that was boarded in the Arabian Sea was NOT boarded by U.S. forces.  It was boarded by Spanish special forces.  Just for clarification. =)<br />
<br />
3.  Protests for the sake of protests?  That would never happen in America!<br />
<br />
Just last week I was reading a newspaper piece written by a Seattle software developer who had actually tracked protesters down on his bicycle following a rally and asked them what it had been about.  None of them had any clue.  Huge surprise.<br />
<br />
4.  rayc says, "We felt vulnerable... and that our way of life was threatened. We used to have air raid drills in school because the USSR had planes and missiles that could reach our country and blow us all to oblivion. That was the perceived threat that we were countering."  All of which is true.  <br />
<br />
He goes on, "This statement represents a serious change in the USA&#39;s attitude. We are no longer dealing with perceived threats to our own existance."  This is only partially true.  Keep in mind that the stated goal of militant Islam is global domination, the same as Stalin, Lenin, Kruschev, Mao, et al.  So to say that the threat to us is "perceived" is incorrect;  the threat to the U.S. and any non-Muslim dominated country is very real, as more than one imam preaches the rite of "kill all the infidels".  <br />
<br />
Then we have, "We are now simply trying to make the rest of the world act in our best interests by force..."  This is just not correct.  First off, we haven&#39;t threatened the rest of the world.  Quite the opposite -- we&#39;ve gone well out of our way to include them.  We&#39;ve focused any threats on Iraq, because the country is run by a known murderer and rapist, who keeps company with a government of murderers and rapists to make himself feel better.  These schmucks have VX and mustard gas and who knows what all else, and have never demonstrated the slightest hesitation in using any of it.  To ask them to comply with the regulations that they agreed to as a part of the cease-fire in &#39;91 is not unreasonable.  C&#39;mon, if Germany had refused to give up it&#39;s remaining tanks and bombs and planes after World War II, do you think Britain and Russia and the U.S. would have stood around and debated what to do?  Of course not.  Same type of situation, just with weapons that are a whole lot nastier.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it is not only OUR best interests we&#39;re working towards here.  Quite frankly, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s in ANYONE&#39;s best interests if Iraq maintains the ability to kill ten thousand plus people whenever Saddam feels like it (except, perhaps, his own best interests, because it keeps him in the center of attention).  You haven&#39;t heard Iran complaining about disarming Saddam, have you?  Probably because they know first-hand that he&#39;ll use everything in his arsenal if he feels like he can get away with it.  <br />
<br />
Which brings me to, "...making it clear that, if our enemies take desparate measures, we will obliterate them rather than simply conquering them."  Well, yes.  Otherwise, what&#39;s to prevent them from just haphazardly tossing chemical rounds at the first people that come across their borders?  Would they be justified in doing so?  Of course, it&#39;s war.  Just so long as they know -- up front -- that they&#39;re going to reap what they sow.  Force is the only kind of diplomacy that anyone in the Middle East grasps, and sometimes, not even then.  Yes, that is a generalization, but it is also generally true.  They don&#39;t want to talk unless it gives them some strategic advantage (like Saddam delaying the inevitable inspections for many months; waving the olive branch at the UN, while scurrying to hide all of the stuff he didn&#39;t want them to find).  Our enemies need to hear that we are willing to give as good as we receive in the WMD department.  It may be a bluff, it may not be; but that&#39;s the art of international diplomacy in a nutshell.<br />

5.  And lastly, "Remember, the media wants you to believe that there are none of us left, but there are a lot of us."  Strange, I&#39;ve had a hard time finding any actual news on TV these past few weeks for all the coverage of five people on the Mall with signs protesting a war in Iraq that hasn&#39;t even started yet.  I have to turn to Fox News just to get away from the coverage of protests for "The Little War That Isn&#39;t" and the sudden discovery of all these homeless people that didn&#39;t exist during the Clinton administration. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Lt.

The policy statement isn&#39;t a change in foreign policy, or a 1st strike doctrine, it&#39;s a reiteration of what&#39;s been the current policy for decades: "If you nuke us, we&#39;ll nuke you"  And I&#39;m all for it.

In St. Augustine FL this past weekend (kind of an artsy community), there were a decent sized group of people marching for peace, including veterans (calling themselves Veterans for Peace).  I talked briefly with them, i hadn&#39;t eaten all day, or i&#39;d have talked more, or even joined them.<br />
<br />
Remember, the media wants you to believe that there are none of us left, but there are a lot of us. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>rayc</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">To the original question. I feel that the statement is deplorable. It saddens me to hear our nation using the beligerent tone and tactics that we are now using. It is clear that we are going to continue to foster the resentment that much of the world feels toward us.<br />
<br />
It is very hard not to look at it in a historical context. Nuclear Weapons used to be a deterent against major powers bent on world domination (Germany, Japan, the USSR, China). We had pretty clear evidence that these countries, at various times, intended global domination by conquest and or revolution. These threats were credible and substantiated by behavior (Nazi Germany attempts to conquer Europe, Japan does the same in Asia and bombs Pearl Harbor, the USSR drops the Iron Curtain over Eastern Europe, China sponsors North Korea and North Vietnam). All of these regimes espoused doctrines that pretty clearly stated their plans for world domination ("We will bury you!" -- Nikita Kruschev). We felt vulnerable to conquest and that our way of life was threatened. We used to have air raid drills in school because the USSR had planes and missiles that could reach our country and blow us all to oblivion. That was the perceived threat that we were countering. <br />
<br />
This statement represents a serious change in the USA&#39;s attitude. We are no longer dealing with perceived threats to our own existance. We are now simply trying to make the rest of the world act in our best interests by force and making it clear that, if our enemies take desparate measures, we will obliterate them rather than simply conquering them. <br />
<br />
And something that seems to be forgotten in all of this is the ecological devastation that will be unleashed if nuclear weapons are used. This impact would affect everyone, the enemies and the allies.      <br />

P.S. I was there in the sixties and seventies. At 10 years old, I marched with my mother in the big anti-war rally on the Boston Common in 1969. We also supported the civil rights movement.

Where does one draw the line between self-defense and piracy?  There were no nuclear devices on board the ship, so we let it go.  Are we now going to say certain countries are allowed to have this and this, but not you guys?  Where do we draw the line?  A scud missile is a delivery device.  So is a rifle, although the package being delivered is quite different.  We are setting ourselves up for serious failure if we try to actively police the world for everything.  I&#39;m all for de-nuking everything possible, but if we try to take away everyone&#39;s toys but our own, we are just asking to get ourselves kicked in the teeth.<br />
<br />
OK, some people think we committed piracy by boading the ship of a sovereign nation with which we are not at war.  I only consider it piracy if we took something from them that didn&#39;t belong to us.  Other than that, its a breach of sovereignty and international law, and while serious, its not something someone will start a war over.  And if we are looking for nukes, I&#39;m ok with that, and so is the non-terrorist portion of the world.  And if we do find nukes, we WILL take them, and the non-terrorist portion of the world will be OK with that too.<br />
<br />
I personally think (hoo-boy this will be a hot one) that our press is too powerful.  That you or I don&#39;t see immediate results from our war on terrorism doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t any.  We caught the guy behind the embassy bombings and the USS Cole, and Newsweek could only report that CIA personnel are interrogating him at an undisclosed location.  What would be the reaction of the ACLU if they were to find out that we&#39;re par-boiling the guy to get critical information?  Personally, I believe in the punishment fits the crime, and I hope the guy has a "heart attack" and doesn&#39;t survive the interrogation.  I think that there&#39;s a lot going on that the press doesn&#39;t know about, or responsible press personnel (does such a thing exist anymore?) are holding back.  I think we&#39;ll learn a lot more about what&#39;s going on after it&#39;s all over. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Old Gaffer</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Sorry about the history lesson, Mike.

I did ask for personal opinions instead of history lessons but we are getting that anyway and that&#39;s ok.<br />
<br />
I just want to know where people stand on the nuclear weapons front. OK? Not ok?<br />
<br />
We intercepted a ship yesterday or the day before that had medium range scud missles on it bound for Yemen (a known terrorist state, ie. USS Cole) from North Korea(another known terrorist playground), we stop and board the ship and say you can&#39;t have these weapons. The world screams bloody murder and that we have broken international laws and we are pirates and that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
So what gives here? Are we fighting a war on terrorism or not? Yemen is a terrorist haven, financier, and overall shytehole of a country. Bascially everything bad on Bush&#39;s terror list and yet we say, "oh Im sorry. please proceed on your way after you lied and said it was a frieghter full of concrete but instead is full of missles and parts that can be fired at our allies". Sorry to have bothered you nice folks."<br />

<br />
"our politicians seem to be under the impression that their election to higher governmental positions gives them some sort of innate, superhuman power."  When did being elected to public office turn individuals into gods?  There are great ones (Ed Rendell, please don&#39;t flame me for thinking highly of the guy), good ones (Arlen Specter - can you tell I&#39;m from Philly?), old ones (Strom Thurmond went to Washington when Warren Harding was president for Christ&#39;s sake - how effective can he be? - wake up Strom it&#39;s time to vote!), and really, really, bad ones (Torricelli - I know he may have done some good things but he loses big time in the what have you done for me lately contests).  Note that I am bipartisan in my opinions.  I will praise and hammer people based on what I think they&#39;ve done, not because of what party they belong to.  Sorry, I&#39;m rambling.  The point is that they are people and therefore unpredicatable.  All we can do is send our reps to Washington and hope they all play nice together, help the  country, and, if not, let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t do any irreparable damage.<br />
<br />
"All day long for at least three years (and still now), we got to hear politicians and scumbags of the same kind go on and on about the sex scandal, when they could have been dealing with things that matter more".  It&#39;s ok for the top guy in country to have interns stashed under every desk?  You&#39;re tired of hearing about the Great Sleazy One?  Yet George is the great usurper simply because the news networks called Florida too early?  Close election, you bet.  First time in history a president got elected with less than the majority of the popular vote?  Not hardly.  There was a lot of controversy, but its over, been over for 2 years.  Now how about everyone else get over it.  Gore can have another shot in 04 if the Dems are stupid enough to run him again.<br />
<br />
"some dork in a suit and tie walks into a session of Congress or the Senate and makes a big deal out of some stupid issue -- like gay rights, for instance -- that won&#39;t make a lick of difference in the long run. Why? Because he cares only for himself"  So I guess if someone gets elected by his constituency because of an issue very important in his area - he becomes a dork when he brings it up in Congress like he promised to if elected?  Gays rights is rather touchy - like Barney Frank of Massachusetts who is openly gay?  (Don&#39;t know if he&#39;s still there)  What exactly do you think Congress does all day?  Sit around and talk about Saddam?  Try reading the Congressional record and see just how mundane it really is.<br />
<br />
Finally, "I&#39;m pretty sure that if our founding fathers found out what our government was doing right now, they&#39;d climb out of their graves and go beat down every last politician and political analyst who perverted and contorted our constitution to their liking."  Actually, if our founding fathers could look at Washington now, they would say gosh darnit, the country is still here, and wow, the Constitution is still working.  Did you ever read the constitution?  Ever notice how SHORT it is?  As far as thinking the founding fathers thought of the big picture, did you know that South Carolina (gosh darnit troublesome state) was going to sink the Declaration of Independence unless Jefferson put "and slavery is ok" back into it?  And that John Adams (a truly great American) couldn&#39;t really take the lead in anything because nobody like him?  Franklin screwed anything that moved, and so did Jefferson, who truly loved his slaves?  And Washington was incredibly arrogant?   Our founding fathers, I believe, would be pretty goddam proud of what our country has become.<br />

As for Molsen&#39;s comment about taking a more realistic view of world politics, first politicians need to take a more realistic view of the world.  The world is not replaceable and we are still mortal beings.  People are not disposable objects like Kleenex.  I am sick and tired of hearing about all the nonsense that goes on in our nation&#39;s capitol, but our politicians seem to be under the impression that their election to higher governmental positions gives them some sort of innate, superhuman power.  For instance, let&#39;s go back to the Clinton years and that whole impeachment mess.  All day long for at least three years (and still now), we got to hear politicians and scumbags of the same kind go on and on about the sex scandal, when they could have been dealing with things that matter more, like the situations in Iraq.  Because of our pathetic inability to set aside our opinions of things that people do in the privacy of their homes, we inadvertently made oral sex a dinner table discussion.<br />
<br />
And it&#39;s not just with Clinton.  Every so often, some dork in a suit and tie walks into a session of Congress or the Senate and makes a big deal out of some stupid issue -- like gay rights, for instance -- that won&#39;t make a lick of difference in the long run.  Why?  Because he cares only for himself, not for the greater good of the American public.  Unforgivable.  It is simply ridiculous to know that the people we elect to lead us are talking about meaningless nonsense like this, when they could be tackling REALLY important issues like our economy, Middle East turmoil, etc.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my previous post, it is still imperitive that our leaders, regardless of political orientation, to PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES and learn to deal with what the public believes is important.  For starters, stop bringing up your Puritanesque beliefs and focus on our safety.  Shut up already with these narrow-minded, theological debates about whether or not a gay man is a real person and focus on what your country will do in the MidEast for the next few years.<br />

By now, you all may have realized that I just don&#39;t give a flying hinko about politics; the concept is pathetic and weak.

Trouble is, Bush looks very much like Saddam himself, thus demonstrating a major flaw in such military logic.<br />

As to my opinion, it is unthinkable that anyone use nuclear weapons again. Therefore nuclear weapons should be decomissioned. Ditto lethal chemical and biological weapons. There is a place for non-lethal chemical agents.<br />

For example, a direct attack on Israel would certainly bring about the end of Saddam&#39;s regime, but an attack by Palestinians secretly sponsored by Saddam (which has already happened!!!) might be overlooked.

Face the facts people, Saddam Hussein is a threat, and by eliminating his capability to use WMD, we are not only protecting the US but also protecting the world.  He may hate the US, but he didnt have a problem invading Kuwait.  Like it or not, the US has a moral responsibility to protect our people, and if that requires them to eliminate problems before they get to american soil, then by all means they should do that.  <br />
And as far as the Osama hunt goes, the US is still searching for him, but they are facing an uphill battle, its not like he has an address or anything.  In fact eliminating Iraq as a possible haven will only serve to tighten the noose.

Also, can you imagine the effect that attacking Iraq would have on our worldly image?  It&#39;s bad enough that the rest of the world thinks that American&#39;s are a bunch of pigs; now we want to nuke people?

The thing that worries me more than anything else is a guy like bin laden who doesnt want hundreds of nukes, he only needs 1 at a time. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>The Judge</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Sorry...this will clarify.<br />

If anyone uses WMD (weapons of mass destruction) against the US, any of her allies, or any of our interests we will attack them with nuclear reprisal. <br />

This is being submitted to congress.<br />

Is it just me or does anyone else get the impression of George Bush that he is a 6 year old with a bucket full of army men, a bathtub full of ships and subs, and a box full of rockets? He has more than all his little friends in the neighborhood and just cant wait to show them off?? </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Old Gaffer</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">I think this was a general comment about a very specific circumstance, but the powers that be couldn&#39;t be specific in making the statement.  I read the whole thing as <br />
<br />
"Saddam, if you use any nasty crap on Israel, Turkey, Iran (yes even Iran who Saddam also hates), or anybody else, we will drop the same on you, only more of it."  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if India were to nuke Pakistan, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have the balls to blow away a couple million Hindus.  And if China were to nuke Tawain, no way in hell would go near that one.  So I think we&#39;re only talking about the little guy that we could easily beat up.  I&#39;m ok with that because we should have taken him out the last time. </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Serpent</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">I remember that crap from elementary school.

It could *very* easily get out of hand.  I mean ieasterlingroup of terrorists who happen to be in a country with nuclear capability use weapons of mass destruction in a terrorist campaign in your country (or allied countries, or just anywhere in the world) are you going to nuke the terrorists???  I doubt the country they&#39;re in would like that very much at all...<br />
<br />
I know there are plenty of things people wish they never invented/discovered after the fact ans many of the chemical weapons used/created are like that...nuclear bombs are the same...biological, hey aren&#39;t those bugs deadly enough without you fiddling with them.  I&#39;d say they&#39;re the stupidist of all as they can mutate on their own so even if you think your country/army are safe with the vaccine you&#39;ve made up against your tailor-made biological weapon they may not be given a couple of generations of mutation to the bacteria or virus... </TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>*</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Dredlox</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont">Could you clarify?
