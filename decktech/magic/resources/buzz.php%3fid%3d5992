I need to do some reading on what is considered decent rake for smaller limit and no limit games. And for tournaments too. Cuz I should know what to avoid. <br />
<br />
Like tonite I got invited to a no-rake sit-n-go. I guess I can afford to play in that :) <br />

<br />
if its like 10% but the max is only $3, thats not something you can&#39;t overcome at a decent limit.<br />
<br />
if its 10% at max $10 that is ridiculously bad since if you win $100 your profit from the hand (on average) likely is all going to the house.<br />
<br />
nothing beats the rake online between the lower rake already and rakeback.<br />

<br />
Rake can either make or break a poker game (making it profitable or non-profitable in the long-term). So you really want to shop around if you have choices for games to play in. Generally I think 4-6% in considered a reasonable rake. The WSOP main event rakes 3% out of tournament entries I think. <br />
<br />
This local place where I won&#39;t play anymore rakes 10% out of pots to a maximum of 10$. That&#39;s excessively high for a 0.25/0.50 NL game. I typically see a max of 4$ at most for games like this.  <br><BR><font size=1>09:34 11-25-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' valign='top' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><img src='/global/images/premium_icon.gif' border='0' hspace='1' vspace='1'></td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B><a href="http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/main/mpage.php?member=3300">Shadow 13</a></B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#CCCCCC' ><font class="bfont">hmm you didn&#39;t bite and explain what a rake is.<br />

Yeah, dec 15th at casino and I THINK they are starting with electronic tables but i"m not 100% sure. I think the last I heard was electronic tables to start and then 12-18 felt tables in the spring or later. <br />
<br />
Dom, there&#39;s a thread in the Star Wars section about you. It&#39;s about a V-Card being made for you.

<br />
<br />
hey next week is WOW world championship. Ill meet old friend vasco and skali. <br />

S</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#CCCCCC' ><font class="bfont">Frog, that environment sounds 10 times better. Honestly, the more rigid the rules, the more comfortable I am cuz idiots (like the ones I played with) get punished. This one moron at Turning Stone once moved in his whole stack as a &#39;joke&#39;, the dealer made him go all-in. I was so happy that was enforced cuz I definately had a reaction to him moving all-in and it&#39;s not fair that he got free information like that. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that&#39;s neither here nor there. Thanks for the advice everyone! I think I got exactly what I was hoping I&#39;d get, which is you guys talking me out of going there. I might go back once but I DOUBT IT. I can&#39;t WAIT for poker to come to Montreal Casino cuz that is the most anal casino I&#39;ve ever seen (blackjack dealers aren&#39;t permitted to talk to you, etc). So I&#39;m sure the poker room will be my pedigree. <br />
<br />
<blockquote><i>and that "I reraise to 6$ " make it at least 9 </i></blockquote><br />
<br />
Yeah, I was trying to induce more action but you&#39;re right, maybe 9 was better. At that point, the table was so tilting against me (not everyone, but at least 5 of the 10 were looking at me like they were out to get me), that I thought raising 6 would be "he&#39;s being such a fockin pain" raise that they might move all in with something like KQs or a pocket pair (hopefully), etc. Anyway, it worked out that one time. <br />
<br />
Dom, you said to me a long time ago that all that matters in this game is pot size. I finally figured that out about 6 months ago and my play has drastically improved. I should play more cash games than tournaments cuz that seems to be my cup of tea but I just have too much discpline to play a game that I could lose an unknown amount of money. Freezeout tournaments (even ones that cost me 330$) give me a warm security feeling cuz I know that&#39;s my max loss. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I knew the idea with the iPod was probably dumb. I&#39;m just trying to figure out how not to have my time ruined like that. But yeah, iPod wouldn&#39;t help. I better just stick to live games in a protected environment. <br />
<br />
Thanks a million, guys, for the great advice and feedback.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m quite proud of myself for realizing that I&#39;m having a bad time, that I&#39;m going to tilt badly, and that I MIGHT be in danger... so I left. Leaving was clearly my best move there even though I MIGHT have made more money if I stayed. Not worth it.  <br><BR><font size=1>08:57 11-20-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Frog</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#FFFFFF' ><font class="bfont">No dealer to tip sounds nice.

<br />
Whether you let those types affect your play at all is another issue, but it always used to bother me that people would be like that.<br />
<br />
A lot of the time i used to play relatively loose in games like that as well and i have definitely suffered my share of jerks, but i usually managed to avoid those types of displays.<br />
<br />
as to why they would yell at you if they thought you were weak: i doubt it was related.  while it is possible they thought you were too good and wanted you out so they could win, it is infinitely more probable that they were just mad you were winning and not them.<br />
<br />
in my whole life i have never seen any of those annoying people who wine constantly about other people winning with bad hands give the money back when they win with some big blind special.<br />
<br />
i never liked wearing an ipod cause a lot of the time if you talk to the people around you you end up meeting some pretty interesting people.<br />
<br />
that rake is ridiculous though and so is the computer table.  sounds like a horrible place to play honestly.  at least you dont have to tip the dealer on top of it. <br><BR><font size=1>01:04 11-20-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>Dom</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#CCCCCC' ><font class="bfont">oh my love. this is terrible. just dont go back there. you dont have to endure that. i mean, its terrible.<br />

I go to war with top two pair but I can lay down bottom two-pair pretty easily depending on the situation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so I had a pretty stressful night of poker last night. I&#39;ll share the story and I hope to get some insight so I don&#39;t get all stressed out next time:<br />
<br />
In Montreal, poker isn&#39;t coming to the casino until December 15th. So until then, you can either play in illegal poker rooms or you can play on the indian reserve. There has always been a place on the indian reserve called Plaza138 but they force you to play for 60 minutes minimum at a cash game which bugs me. Also their tournaments never start on time so we don&#39;t go there anymore. <br />
<br />
Now there&#39;s a new place. It&#39;s 100% the electronic tables. They have TONS of them. They run some sit-n-gos but it&#39;s almost entirely cash games. I chose to play 0.25/0.50 No Limit with a max buy-in of 40$. The rake is 10% to a max of 10$ which I find excessive but whatever. <br />
<br />
So I put 80$ on my card and sit down. It&#39;s really hard to see what&#39;s in the pot cuz it only updates after all action is finished on any given street. Plus, it&#39;s upside down for me cuz I&#39;m at the other end of the table. No big deal I guess but it&#39;s annoying having to always count the numbers in front of everyone&#39;s cards with the pot. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s harder to track pot size than in a real game, but it is. <br />
<br />
Anyway, my main beef is that when its time for showdown, guess who shows first? In a real game, it&#39;s the guy that put in the last action on 5th street or, if there&#39;s no action, then whoever is closest to dealer. So position has an advantage cuz you sometimes get to see what people call you with, etc. But on these tables, the BEST HAND shows and no one else shows! WTF? Once I checked down an underfull on the river cuz I was half worried he had the overfull but mostly cuz I wanted to see if he had the KK I put him on. But he never showed even though I had the button and there was no action on 5th street! That bugged me. <br />
<br />
Ok, so the first 40$ went so-so. I got it up to 65$ and then raised it up in the cut-off seat with ATo in a 10-player game. Probably a bad move. I get min-raised by the BB so I call. Flop is AQJ with two clubs (I have the Ten of clubs) so I have top pair, good kicker, gut-shot and possible backdoor flush. I bet it out, get min-raised, call. Turn is a low club so now I have flush draw too. I check and he checks so I call. River is a non-club 9. Pot is 70$ or so so I go all-in with my last 30$ cuz it&#39;s a scary board and maybe he&#39;ll laydown two pair if that&#39;s what he has. He thinks about it forever and calls with AK (no clubs). Nice call. The table sends me a few nods of approvement for my river bet which I think they liked. <br />
<br />
Anyway, no big deal. The table is full of 9 french-speaking guys in their very early 20&#39;s. 3 or 4 of them seem very chummy and talk alot (sometimes even making borderline coaching during hands). <br />
<br />
So i fill up to 40$ for a last try and get 85c later on when I&#39;m up to 55$. I had the button and there was a sick amount of limping going on. I call cuz I like the odds and my position and it&#39;s a hand I actually like to play in cash games but in tournaments as much. The BB puts in a ridiculously small raise to 2$. I was thinking to myself if someone raises to 4$, I&#39;ll probably fold but I think I&#39;ll call anything under that. So 6 people call and it&#39;s on me. I call easily and the SB folds! Man, his odds were crazy good. <br />
<br />
Anyway flop is A76 with one club. BB (the guy who raised preflop) goes all-in for 44$. There is 16$ in the pot. It folds around to the cut-off seat who calls all-in for 38$ or so. Anyway, there&#39;s about 100$ in the pot and it&#39;s 44$ to me to call. I&#39;m open ended and drawing to 1 nut straight and 1 non-nut straight. I figure I need about 2.17:1 to call and I like my odds. Plus I have a backdoor flush possibilty which I&#39;ll count as another 1.5 outs or so. So I make the call. <br />
<br />
The raiser has 66 and flopped a set. The other guy had nothing really good (KQ or something). I get runner-runner flush and things get ugly from this point on. <br />
<br />
We get 2 free drink coupons when we come so I was getting chummy with some guys at the table so I make a stupid joke about offering the guy a free drink coupon as a consolation prize for losing with a set against 85s. Bad idea. One guys says, "Oh man, you shouldn&#39;t have told him that." and the guys starts really laying into me. They knew that I had played before so I was gettinga alot of, "The worst part is he has experience and he plays crap like 85." It&#39;s hard to convey in this post but it was getting REALLY tense cuz the frustration of this guy was mounting higher and higher along with his friends (one of which I cracked his pocket kings earlier with T9o and turned an underfull to beat him). <br />
<br />
So I&#39;m kinda uncomfortable but it&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen before. Next hand IMMEDIATELY after the 85s, I get AA. The timing couldn&#39;t be better cuz the table is getting more and more agited as they talk about the hand history of how it was played. They can&#39;t decide if they&#39;re more mad about my pre-flop call (lol) or my call on the flop (which was maybe questionable but whatever, it&#39;s a cash game). So the guy&#39;s friend with a stack of 90$ raises to 2$ and the guy who lost 38$ in the last hand (and who&#39;s pocket kings I cracked) calls. I reraise to 6$ and they both call. <br />
<br />
Flop is K-rag-rag with two suited cards. The guy bets out 3$, the other guy calls and I raise to 9$. He thinks about it forever and I mean FOREVER and he calls. The next guy then moves all-in for 11$. <br />
<br />
Ok, now in a REAL game, I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to raise here cuz the raise isn&#39;t a legal amount so he hasn&#39;t added action that would permit me to reraise. But this stupid computer table LETS ME reraise if I want to. This is huge because obviously the other guy is on some kind of draw. So I make it 27$ and he gets really pissed off and moves all-in for 90$. I think about it and call. He has KQ (top pair, good kicker). My AA holds up and wins another really big pot. I now have a stack of 240$ and the level of tension at this table is REALLY high. They are openly swearing at me and calling me awful things so I cash out and leave with Sara (who lost like 40$ on another table that was laughing the whole time). <br />
<br />
Ok, that&#39;s the story. I cash out 240$ which means I&#39;m up 160$ at a 0.25/0.50 game in which I played for like 15-20 minutes. It&#39;s a fairly abnormal gain and in truth, I should have maybe stuck around cuz if I then played tight, I could probably do well. <br />
<br />
BUT I was definately tilting at this point from being yelled at so much (as was made visible by my shaky hands when I was cashing out) so I just left cuz I wasn&#39;t having fun anymore and I only play for fun<br />
<br />
(btw, side note to Dom if he&#39;s reading: I ran into Guy and his wife there. We used to see them at Awkwesasne all the time. He won the bad beat jackpot of 50k once. They really like this poker room). <br />
<br />
So I ended up having a really bad time and was stressed out about it when I got home. This is really lame cuz I shouldn&#39;t react that way when this stuff happens. So any advice you guys can offer (besides not playing 85s cuz it makes people mad) would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
<br />
I find it kinda funny too cuz they CLEARLY thought I was some kind of stupid fish and kept yelling, "WE&#39;RE Obiviously all gonna win that money back from this idiot so whatever." But if they really thought I was an inferior player, why would they purposely try to run me from the game? Anytime I play against REALLY weak players (tight-passive or weak-aggressive) I try to keep them there as long as I can. I don&#39;t always win their money but often do. So I think these guys are kinda dumb for running me from the game if they really did think I was weak. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I&#39;m really sick of playing in environments where I don&#39;t feel protected at all. Since there&#39;s no dealer, no one is monitoring the table. There&#39;s a guy with a gun near the cash room who I can page to the table with the press of a button but that&#39;s it. I&#39;ve seen altercations at casinos but the dealer ALWAYS intervenes before it gets anywhere near bad. Usually involving a floor manager too. I&#39;ve seen lots of guys escorted out of poker rooms for being abusive or disruptive. I think that the language being used last night would have warranted that. I definately didn&#39;t feel especially safe being in a shady poker room on an indian reserve. <br />
<br />
So I think I might stick to big casino room play. <br />
<br />
But it sucks cuz more and more (based on my results), I&#39;m convinced that I&#39;m not that great a tournament player or limit cash player, but seems to have the build for cash-game no limit. But my fragility to events like this really bug me cuz obviously this stuff is going to happen. <br />
<br />
Maybe I should just shut up? I think that&#39;s actually a good solution. Maybe I bring an iPod and don&#39;t talk to anyone. I won&#39;t be aware people are mad so I won&#39;t tilt. And I won&#39;t accidentally instigate people to get mad which often happens. <br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to blow some steam and get, hopefully, some helpful advice.  <br><BR><font size=1>11:43 11-19-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Meto</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#FFFFFF' ><font class="bfont">He was short stacked before I got there and we ended up all-in with two pair against a bigger two pair.

and yes i was talking about book 2, i wasn&#39;t expecting much since harrington seems like a very tight player from watching him but there was a lot of pretty good stuff in there <br><BR><font size=1>23:38 11-15-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Patrick M.

<br />
Are we talking about Vol II? Cuz yeah, that book DEFINES the multi-table tournament experience better than anything else. I owe pretty much all my tournament wins to that book. <br />
<br />
You play mid-level limit hold&#39;em at all? 20-40 and up? Cuz if you do, honestly there&#39;s nothing better than Hold&#39;em for Advanced Players by Sklansky, Malmuth and Zee (I think). That book is BUSTED on how it gives you an edge in those types of card games. But it&#39;s very specific to non low-limit hold&#39;em. You can&#39;t use that book very well at low-limit and most certainly not for no-limit.  <br><BR><font size=1>08:09 11-15-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#CCCCCC>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#CCCCCC><font class="bfont"><B>XjedeyeX</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor='#CCCCCC' ><font class="bfont">also thanks for recommending the harrington book pat, while there was a lot i already knew going in, it was a good read anyway and id recommend it myself to someone else too <br><BR><font size=1>00:57 11-15-2007</font></TD></TR><TR><td width='4' bgcolor=#FFFFFF>&nbsp;</td><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Patrick M.

Harrington on Hold&#39;em vol III (I would avoid this)<br />
