And many very cheap commons, and other card that make this game great, and a lot of just this and just that, because usually that is just what you have when you start.  Basically good o&#39; fashion fun here.  This deck can win many games when it is on a roll, damage comes quick, and Serra&#39;s Embrace is a machine, and probably the best card in this deck.  You need to be fast to beat counter decks, but others shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br>
<br>
I would have listed this as a beginner deck, but it has more rares, but I did want to target those just getting into to this game.  On thing about this deck, that no one will deny, is that it is fun to play, fun to play against, and still wins more games than it will lose.<br>

Thanks,<br>
