He has the option to take damage with skullscorch though which will make my deck win easier. Either way, its good for me. Book burning lets me win quicker or gets creature cards into my library. I might even mill my opponent for 6 if they seem like they need it. Buried alive gets creatures into my graveyard. Zombie infestation also gets creatures into my graveyard, while providing a base of protection from rush/weenie decks. I might even attack for a win or just wear down my opponents with my zombie tokens. If zombie infestation doesn&#39;t work against my opponent&#39;s creatures, I&#39;ll pull out an earthquake to clear the board and make my win easier. Browbeat makes the win easier or accelerates my deck. Howling mine accelerates my deck so I will always have extra cards in my hand to chuck for zombie tokens. Goretusk firebeast and laquata&#39;s champion are the 8 creatures I&#39;m trying to get into my graveyard. With all of this deck&#39;s direct damage, I won&#39;t need a lot of them in my graveyard - just a couple. Then, I pull out a balthor on the fourth turn to finish my opponent off (if they&#39;re not already dead!) The price of glories and molten influences in my sideboard are for blue control. Flaring pains for solitary confinement decks. Addles for a little extra discard (helps against solitary confinement decks also.) Shatter for decks with artifacts (eg. burning bridges), and innocent bloods for a little extra creature removal, if needed. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
