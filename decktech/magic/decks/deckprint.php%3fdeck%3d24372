This deck is designed to win against another control deck.  It attempts to out-counter its opponent, and win with uncounterable cards.  The basic plan is to play an arcane lab turn three, and then a howling mine turn four.  If this is accomplished, your simply draw too many counters for your opponent to handle within the constraints of the lab.  Once control is established, you simply wait for a monastery, and go for the win, or you just send the mystic snakes in for beatings.  This deck performs well against aggro-control and control decks.  Since it was designed with control in mind, this deck has some problems with aggro decks, especially those that pack hand disrupt.  Against those decks, the plan is to resolve an evacuation behind a lab, and then to counter at your leisure.  This deck is a great deal of fun to play because it wears your opponent out, and also because having complete control is fun.  If you expect predominantly control decks at your store, then this is an excellent deck to use. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
