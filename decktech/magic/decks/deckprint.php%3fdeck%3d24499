Do not bother wasting your spells on the person unless they are running a graveyard recursion theme.  Kill off your opponent&#39;s creatures and then have yours settle down for the kill.  Most of the creatures will die after one turn unless you pay extra.  If there is a lot of mana, feel free to keep them around but this deck works great without keeping them alive.  If the opponent is running a creature light deck then start throwing most of your burn spells at them.  This deck has a couple of forms of colorless damage in the form of Cursed Scroll and to get around any story cirles or COP, there are some stalking stones and Mishra&#39;s Factory.  Keep control of the board and you will be able to outrun even stasis or permission decks.  The one type of deck that this has trouble with is reccuring combos taht set up killer wins.  Most of the time you can recognize this and just start to try to kill the opponent as fast as you can.  You can really have some fun with this deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
