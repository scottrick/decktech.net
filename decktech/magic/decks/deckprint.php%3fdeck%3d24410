First, when playing a creature deck, your first objective is to get out Humility and Orim&#39;s Prayer to slow down the creatures(Weenie one&#39;s can hurt at first). Next, you want to want play Serra&#39;s Sanctum when you have the chance to increase the mana your have per turn. Then, try tp play Academy Rector or use a Enlightned tutor to look for a Sacred Mesa and/or Gerrard&#39;s Battle Cry. With Humility, Orim&#39;s Chant, Sacred Mesa, and Gerrard&#39;s Battle Cry in play, it&#39;ll be hard for your opponents creatures to do anything at all. When you have these four enchantments out, you can play a Martyr&#39;s Cause for some guarenteed insurance for protection. Finally, if you can create multiple tokens every turn from the Sacred Mesa(which should be no problem being that Serra&#39;s Sactum in play), then should win the game with in a few turns. <br>
<br>
This deck is slow to start at first, but usually wins on your 5th or 6th turn. Turn 1-3 are your set up turns, which is possibly to have both Humility and Orim&#39;s Prayer out by turn 3(turn 4 most of the time). The only deck I usually watch out for are counter heavy decks, burn decks, and one&#39;s, which have cards such as tranquility or cards like it. Those decks give me the most trouble. Every other deck is a piece of cake! The sideboard is well suited for anything this deck can&#39;t handle including land destruction and counters. I&#39;ve given most of my opponents headaches when playing this deck against them, lol. Nevertheless, most of my opponents have never beat me playing creature based decks.<br>
