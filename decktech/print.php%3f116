<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Mystic Moon Coming Soon! posted by DeckTech on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br><img src=/news/images/mmoon.gif align=left>The Mystic Moon Academy for Magi, the latest in a long list of excusive DeckTech features, will be opening in early February. This gives players new to DeckTech the ability to start hording those tech points in anticipation of some added features they will be able to purchase. <br>
<br>
There are many ways to earn tech points, first of which is to post at least four quality submissions. After your fourth submission all the tech points in your account will be enabled on the MND site. Make sure you review plenty of decks because right now for each MND deck you review you get +20 tech points. <br>
<br>
Players already familiar with DeckTech from our other gaming sites will notice that some new features are already enabled on the MND site, while others, like being able to edit your deck strategy, are not enabled. These features and many others will be available for purchase as powers, effects, relics and spells at the Mystic Moon. <br>
<br>
These items will either stay with you or are expended after their use. Each member will have a Magi on their member page that shows all the powers, effects, spells and relics that member has learned or collected. Some of these items will be rare and powerful and can only be obtained by winning a contest or &#8220;finding&#8221; them on the site. <br>
<br>
Others might have quite unexpected and undesirable effects so beware! Not to worry though, most possessions simply give the players that earned their keep, by providing quality content for the site, the ability to customize and improve the DeckTech. <br>
<br>
Some of the things that will be available early next week: <br>
<ul><br>
<li>Relic, Universal Armor: Reduce the damage you take from 2 star reviews. <br>
<li>Spell, Transmutation: Change your first last or member name, to any that is available. One use only. <br>
<li>Power, Wisdom Beyond Years: Earn bonus tech points whenever you give out helpful reviews. <br>
<li>Power, Gaze: See everything submitted in the last 5 days at a glance.<br>
<li>Relic, Ring of Remembering: Use the ring to update your decks strategy, if you forgot something when you entered it.<br>
<li>Power, Intensify:  When you give a review, all tech point effects of that review are doubled.<br>
<li>More&#8230;</ul><br>
So start earning those points! If you have any questions about the Mystic Moon or suggestions for powers, relics, effects and spells post them below.<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Thu Jan 31 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Andrew Green said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>Awsome, I'm look'n foward to it
