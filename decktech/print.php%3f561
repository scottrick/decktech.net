<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>God Save The Queen - England Star Wars Revival! posted by scott on Fri Jun 29 2007 <br>Yes, chap, the Brits are back. We will have the first English Star Wars tournament in years <br />
thanks to new UK Flight Leader Darren Pilbeam (mail him at darren.pilbeam@hotmail.co.uk).<br />
Date: Sunday 29th July 2007 <br />
Location:<br />
<br />
Phoenix Games<br />
Church Gate<br />
Leicester<br />
LE1 3AL<br />
<br />
Games: 4 games<br />
Format: Constructed, all Cards (E1, Classic, and Virtual Cards) allowed, no clear sleeves<br />
Entry fee and prices: TBD<br />
<br />
Please spread the word, and call whatever bloke’s number you still might have from the old days.<br />
If you live anywhere in the UK, chances are good that you’ve received a message from Darren<br />
(the guy’s a beast, he checked all Decktech members, and wrote to every-one in England).<br />
So, if you can’t make it, send or notify a buddy at least.<br />
<br />
This is the first tourney, so it’s important to have as many players attending as possible, if you want the English Star Wars tourney scene to flourish again. This may be a no charge/no prices<br />
tourney, or maybe a small fee for room rent and some prices. It depends on how many players <br />
attend. We have prices, maybe monthly tourneys and a regional planned for next year, if it is a success.<br />
<br />
Don’t leave Darren hanging, guys, and most important… have fun playing again.<br />
<br />
May the Force be with You.<br />
