<br>
Ongoing events are the event series Pioneered by <b>Adam Drake</b> for the DPC.  They are a continual series of events with the popular DT multi game format and are for $100 cash prizes.<br>
<br>
Our newest addition is <b>Mitch Galliart</b> who will be running $100 tournaments in the great southern city of <b>Huntsville, AL</b>.  Huntsville is a major gaming place for Decipher games, Magic, and Interactive Imagination (Magi Nation Duel).<br>
<br>
Eveyone welcome Mitch aboard, and get on down to huntsville.<br>
<br>
More locals may become available.  If you have a <b>very strong</b> local scene and are an enterprising tournament director with access to a good venue, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:neal@decktech.net">me, Neal Razi</a> about joining the team.<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Thu Oct 3 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>n said on Thu Oct 3 2002 <br>huntville is a rockin gamer area.

How many Tennessee & Georgia Players are up to it?! Can the "out-of-staters" outnumber the locals?<br>
<br>
Steven Lewis can overtake Brian Hunter on the 2002 Leader Board with a Win in Huntsville!<br>
<br>
Steve, Do you think you can still win in Huntsville?  or are you going to stay away?<br>
<br>
Clint? Tomayko? Tripp? Laceys? Trevor B? Mike K? Josh M? Charlie? Y'all coming or not?<br>
<br>
Come have some fun and see who can take home the cash.<br>
<hr>Law Sterling said on Fri Oct 4 2002 <br>We'd better have a good turnout...I've lined up some solid prize support from 2i and we want to be able to give as much of it out as we can.<hr>Kenneth Bradford said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>Yep, Mitch is on a quest to get all of my money.  He is evil and must be stopped!<br><br>Seriously, this is like the best area for gaming;  there are no fewer than 4 quality shops in a 30 mile area--The Deep, Dr. Bob's, Anime Invasion, and Mitch's very own All-American Sports Cards.  And the competition is tight!  I'm personally all for shipping the McClures to some other area so they'll be someone else's problem!  :))<br><br><br>
And no mention of this area would be complete without Jim "The Man" Colson.  All in all, a great place to game.  I'm sure the money will bring in the champions from around the state...should be interesting!
