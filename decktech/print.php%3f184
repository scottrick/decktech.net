Any secret stuff yet?<hr>Mike Minnillo said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>wow..that naz card is awesome<hr>brandon kilian said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>damn the naz carg is really good<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>Now if only nazgul were good to go along with it :P<hr>Michael Dalton said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>Could someone please explain to me why everyone thinks this nazgul card is good?  It's like Beyond the Height of Men, only a more narrow use.  Do people really like playing cards that might be totally useless when you draw them?<hr>Wouter Neyt said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>now if only it would say wound instead of exertion whoops did i just reveal a witch-king?<hr>Kenneth Bradford said on Thu May 16 2002 <br>So long as there is Versatility, that Saruman will be mostly a$$.  Can you imagine?  Paying four to play the big guy, then "Versatility"...and hey, you've got a guy who's exhausted, can't exert to do his thing, and can't be assigned to fight in any way.  SMELL THE RATINGS~!<br><br>The Nazzie card would be better if it targeted archers and not just "ranged weapon bearers".  All the Legoli running around are the chief problem.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Fri May 17 2002 <br>Saruman's crappy right now, but we haven't seen all of his support cards yet...<br>
<br>
And Uruk Scout takes care of ARV (mostly...)<hr>Grégoire Lefebvre said on Mon May 20 2002 <br>Sorry but i'm not sure that a nazgul card can be a common card? Is it possible?<hr>Grégoire Lefebvre said on Mon May 20 2002 <br>the dwarven condition is really cool but there is'nt a lot of good dwarven tale, except GKomP..... Of course will come the excellent Book of Mazarbul but will it be enough??<hr>Alex Weavers said on Mon May 27 2002 <br>How is Saruman crappy?<br>
<br>
1) It forces them to use their Versatilities - instead of comboing with Lego to kill off your serious beasties.<br>
<br>
2) Lurtz + Saruman = Kill companion?<br>
<br>
3) There is no restriction on assigning 3 minions to one companion.  With 3x Damage+1's on a single companion, odd's are they're screwed (even if it's the useless power 5 dudes that cost 2).  Basically, if they give you 10 shadow, you can kill a companion.<br>
<br>
4) Unless Lego can kill all your minions, you can probably kill Lego.<br>
<br>
5) Assign a power 5 dude to their main companion (Aragorn, Gandalf), with an Assassin or Lurtz sitting out.  Heh.
