<br />
DeckTech is happy to announce the winners of the VS System "Man of Steel" Deck and <br />
Article Contest!<br />
<br />
We had a TON of great material from which to choose, and <br />
judging the winners was no easy task. We'd like to thank Upper Deck <br />
Entertainment for their generous donation of prizes that made this contest <br />
possible, as well as the AWESOME VS players here at DeckTech--some of the <br />
best!<br />
<br />
Here were the prizes:<br />
<br />
<B>First place</B> in both the <br />
Article and Deck competition won the coveted box of Superman: Man of Steel <br />
boosters, a signed Batman starter deck from the R&amp;D department at UDE, and a <br />
very cool Man of Steel VS T-shirt.<br />
<br />
<B>Second place</B> for each contest <br />
netted the autographed Batman starter deck as well as a Man of Steel <br />
T-Shirt.<br />
<br />
<B>Third and Fourth</B> for each competition won a Man of Steel <br />
T-Shirt for their trouble.<br />
