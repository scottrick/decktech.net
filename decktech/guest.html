                        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">You submit 
                          a deck, article or tournament report and your submission 
                          gets stamped with the date you submitted it. The DeckTech 
                          computer system will then grant you access to our entire 
                          database of submissions for you to review, comment on, 
                          and rate if you so choose. The DeckTech database will 
                          be updated in real time, which means as soon as you 
                          submit your material, it will be available to the rest 
                          of the DeckTech members for review. The content on the 
                          site will change hourly. You can use your control panel 
                          to monitor the changes that interest you. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Your account 
                          will be granted member access for 3 weeks after your 
                          last submission date. If you let more than 3 weeks go 
                          by without submitting any new data, your account will 
                          automatically switch into guest mode. As a guest you 
                          will only be able to see the information that is 3 weeks 
                          old or older. Also guests are not able to review or 
                          comment on other people’s submissions. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#000000">So 
                          what is to prevent me from just copying someone else’s 
                          deck every two weeks, changing a card or two, and submitting 
                          it as my own just to get member access?</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Nothing, 
                          except if your tech rating gets to low you automatically 
                          get sent back into guest mode and your account gets 
                          scheduled for review by a DeckTech Admin.</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#000000">Okay, 
                          so what’s up with this tech rating you’re talking about?</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Your submissions 
                          are available for review by the rest of the DeckTech 
                          members. They can rate your submission. Each time you 
                          get rated extremely low you get tech points taken away; 
                          anything rated medium to high and you get tech points 
                          added. If your submission looks like a copy and paste 
                          job you might not get away with it. Sure you can risk 
                          it, but you don’t want to get a reputation as a &quot;corrupter&quot;. 
                          </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#000000">Hmm, 
                          so tech points are given based on the quality of my 
                          submission? </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">That is 
                          correct. DeckTech members rate each other’s submissions. 
                          The points will be used to qualify you for awards. In 
                          addition as your tech rating goes up your opinion will 
                          count more, so the more effect your rating will have 
                          on others people submission. This is the way it works 
                          in real life, the expert’s opinions count more. Don’t 
                          worry though nobody will be able to rate you into guest 
                          mode himself or herself no matter how high their tech 
                          rating.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">
