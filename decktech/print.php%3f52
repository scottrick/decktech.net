<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Should Reflections III be Legal for Worlds? posted by DeckTech on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>If we decide to do Worlds for Star Wars, should we allow Reflections III to be legal? Here are some pros and cons. Let us know your opinion.<br>
<br>
Reasons to allow it:<br>
1. If you don't the tournament will not be sanctioned.<br>
2. The current play environment is by some opinions stale and somewhat cheesy.<br>
<br>
Reasons not to allow it:<br>
1.	Save all players money so more can come to the event or spend it on other things.<br>
2.	Prevent the potential for creating an unknown, unbalanced play environment.<br>
<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Slmenster said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>who cares if it's not sanctioned? the game is probably dead after this tournament anyway...<hr>Bravo 3 said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>well i'm not going, but if i were i would want R3.  The shields will certainly level the playing field (as well as unfortunatly eliminate some valid fun decks)  Was sabacc broken?<hr>Hobbit said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I wouldn't have it, why make people buy all that crap for 1 tourney.  Holland doesn't look like he wants to give $$ to help out or anything, so put the pressure on him.  If he helps the event then make R3 legal so he makes $$$.  If he doesn't help out make sure he doesn't get any more filthy rich.<hr>brad said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>eh, i dont care.  If its not within 50 miles of me, i wont be going.<hr>Jason Foss said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I realy dont care either way. I guess i kinda want no R3 just so i dont have to buy the cards. But no snctioned tourny sucks. I will be at it no matter what.<hr>H2O said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I'm for it, I'm gunna buy it anyway so i might as well use it.<hr>Sgt_Barich said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>im gonna buy ref3 anyways, even though i think it shouldnt be allowed at worlds. i am buying it because i wont quit the game no matter what turns it makes. however i think somepeople would like to spend their money on other things, since they are quiting after this.<br>
<br>
i vote no on ref3.<hr>Philip said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>Heck No! I think Warren Holland has made enough money for such a jack@$$<hr>Michael Pistone said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I agree with Justin, we are gonna buy it anyways might as well be able to use it.<hr>RexBanner7 said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>It depends on the amount of time between R3's release and worlds. Any less than a month, and no. But otherwise, I wouldn't mind. I'd just want to have time to playtest it.<hr>Hunter said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>Yes, Reflections III needs to be legal for any sort of world championship event.  I know MANY people who despise the current "meta" (myself included), who would much rather see a new play environment, and are reluctant to play the game right now until there is one.  <hr>faramir said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>Heck no.  Let everyone have their last bash w/out having to buy any more cards.  I really doubt Reflections 3 will fix things, way more likely it'll just shift the power to other stupid decks.<hr>Artwo said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>Yes, it has to be legal! Like Hunter said, the current meta is terrible and worlds would be completely unbalanced and, well, boring without RIII. Aren't we all tired of WYS? Podracing EVERYWHERE? Seriously people, worlds is here to prove your skill and you won't be able to do that if the play environment is the same as it has been for months. Changing the meta forces players to show their skill by building original decks. Wow, what a concept, huh?<hr>Chu said on Mon Oct 8 2001 <br>I vote no for Ref3 purely because I don't want to spend another dime on yet more powerful cards we have to have. The current environment may be stale but at Phoenix there were some very innovative decks. There is still some gameplay left before it becomes Jp/Expand vs Throne Room start.<hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>If it's legal everyone has to buy it to be competitive. If it's not you can still buy it if you want, but don't have too. Seems simple.<hr>zwitter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Hunter and Chu both have good points and sum up the for and against arguments perfectly.on one hand no body wanst to spend more money to line Holland's pockets and risk replacing old super powerful decks with new super powerful decks. on the other hand does anyone want to see WYS or AOTBS podracing win worlds?i sure don't.atleast R3 will force ppl. to create new and innovative decks.by the same token though, R3 will eliminate some ppl. from th cometition just cause they can't afford to outlay the money to get R3 and become competitive. so i dunno.<hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Well, since it wouldn't be sanctioned anyway, why not just ban podracing, and inserts? That creates a new enviroment, yet people don't have to shell out more money? <hr>edmund said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>not that i'm coming, but why would anyone want to give holland more money? i think one reason you haven't seen a lot of innovative decks is because people were saving them for worlds, maybe i'm wrong. but it would suck for all the peole who were brainstorming/testing to start over.<hr>Patchell said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I have to agree with Hunter here, the current meta does suck. RIII should definately be allowed.  Honestly, people, for all you guys saying your gonna quit i really dont beleive the bulk of you will.  You're maybe angry and not thinking. I think the bulk of you may just be a little cheap or unable to afford it.  I plan on buying at least 4 boxes so I definately want it in.  YES, RIII FOR WORLDS.<hr>John said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>HELL NAW!<br>
1. Decipher has abadoned us, screw them, do not support giving them a dime.<br>
2. Makes a better enviroment for finding out who the true #1 is, anyone playing that new obj. would win (DEFINITLY).<hr>Baroni said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>There is no way R3 should be leagal. I dont want to spend another #&!%ing dime on Decipher. The play einviorment isnt that cheesey. Sanctioned doesnt amtter becaus the game is already dead<hr>BlackViper said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Okay, giving Holland money sucks. And if you allow Ref3, I'm not gonna pack any in my decks. As for being innovative, making m&t high destiny takes away all the strategy of the game - boba fett is more powerful than vader, for crying out loud.<br>
<br>
But as for the non-sanctioned thing, that kinda hurts. I don't know where you guys are, but I'm in the middle of 1700 and I want to break 1800 before it all ends. Sort of a last push, if you will. Bring on Ref3. Mains, auto-hits, and numbers all in the same deck. Nice. Make it legal, and let's just see who actually buys the stuff. My vote for Ref3 is yes. A hesitant yes, but a yes nonetheless.<hr>-Avatar- said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>No. Why buy more cards for a dying game? The meta is stale, yes, but considering the high possibility that swccg will not exist for NEXT years worlds, there's a reason to stick without R3. <hr>Hunter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Saying that allowing reflections III will keep people away who can't afford to buy the new cards is just ridiculous.  Everyone would have needed to buy those cards to compete at D-con anyway, so what's the difference?  And people will actually save money by flying to the site of DPC worlds (especially if it is Vegas) instead of having to pay for a trip to freakin Virginia Beach.  In answer to the post made by "David"....yeah, actually, that would work too.  I would probably still play, even without Reflections III, IF podracing and inserts were banned as he suggested.  That would leave WYS as the only true evil that we'd have to put up with.<hr>mystikal said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>i'l [lay no mtatter what... but no R3 would be pleasant<hr>Darryll Silva said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I say yes because people will bring cheese and win because nobody will be prepared.. Also everybody is lying like patch said nobody will quit they are just pissed at BigD and don't know what is going to happen to the game...YES TO R3<hr>Chu said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>So the sides are basicaly stale environment/anti-cheese vs the no-more-money-to-warren faction. I agree with David's suggestion and Hunter's agreement: ban podracing and insert. If that's what people are complaining about the most (and rightfully so, perhaps) then kill it so people will play "real" decks.<br>
<br>
As to Hunter's argument: sure they had to buy Ref3 for Worlds. But now they don't, and it'll save quite a bit of cash. Why change that? Things are different now than they were then. Speaking purely for myself: I was going to buy barely enough Ref3 to do well at Worlds. Now since I don't have to, even if I save $5 it's more money I don't have to spend on a worthless cause.<hr>Hayes said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>as dan commented, i will play regardless of the situation.  <br>
<br>
however, i <B>strongly</b> object to david's comment about banning cards.  i hate it when people complain about this cheese or that.  no, i will never play #s, no, i will only rarely podrace (i think out of the 66 games i've played since tatooine came out, i only used a deck that podraces for 9 or them), but that doesn't mean i don't respect those strategies.  they are a part of the game and are essential to it's diversity.  without them we'd be playing jedi knights.  i think of any new cards in entirely the same way. <br>
<br>
as a corrolation to that (and including several other points i won't get into) i cannot play this game seriously if it's not sanctioned.  it's not the money that matters to me, nor the rating (directly); it is the honor.  i play to win.  and i want my games, win or lose, to be real and officially documented.  it's a shame finals aren't santioned, but that's for another rant.  for now i will merely leave you with my vote: <br>
<br>
<b>Reflections 3 should be legal. </b><hr>avatar24 said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I don't care whether or not you allow R3 or disallow it, but the notion that you could hold a "Worlds" and disallow certain legitimate strategies is HORRIBLE.  I would be willing to attend with or without R3, but not if certain cards are illegalized. World Championships should not be a boutique-format tourney.<hr>Hunter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Well, avatar24, if you disallow R3, then a "boutique-format tourney" is EXACTLY what you'll have anyway.  Once you remove reflections 3, you are no longer playing SWCCG at all.  You're just playing something you made up, and happen to be using some Star Wars cards to do so.  That's exactly why the tournament would not be sanctioned without R3, because Decipher will not sanction "boutique-format tourneys".  You should have been able to realize this before posting your "thoughts".<hr>Doug Kitzman said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ok so odds are I won't make it anyway but here are my thoughts. I have been playing this game since it first started and I have seen alot of stupid stuff from decipher but its getting to be a bit much for me. I didn't like the idea of Episode 1 cards in the first place since it gets away from the whole point of the game but I took it anyway and moved on. Then the idea of bringing out so many sets this year was a very bad one but ok I took it. Now the cancel worlds which is a really really bad call. So I am still sort of sticking around and after seeing the first cards for R3 from Hayes I thought they looked good but after seeing the card list my worst fears seem to have come to life. The defense of shield versions of cards like "Your Insight Serves You Well" and the ROPS killer and now a Sabaac killer?!?! this is about the worst thing I have ever seen. They are killing decks that don't need to be killed so they can have a mains and toys only game. Thats what Young Jedi is for dang it. They are taking all of the stratagy out of this game. I doubt i'll buy R3 or keep playing this game as a result of this final nasty mistake on Decipher's part. I understand many don't feel this way and thats fine but I know some do. My vote would be no R3 for worlds both because I am sure many don't want to put up the money for this game when they plan to quit and because it just wouldn't be any fun. The meta at the moment isn't as bad as you all say iether. There are tons of cool tech decks that no one seems to be making that can crush Watch Your Step and Podracing. If you hate inserts just add 3 cards do you dark deck to stop them and 1 to your light deck. Not only that but those cards have great other purposes if your not playing against inserts. Please people its not that hard just use your head. Banning cards is a lame idea. These cards are easy to beat. If I came I can tell you that my dark deck wouldn't lose a game to Watch Your Step no matter who I was playing against.<hr>Mason Gilligan said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Defintely R3!!!<hr>DOm said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>i would not allow that. it will do like world 1998 and matt potter. and i wont use any more money on swccg.<hr>mattsokol said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>please do not allow R3. We'll be spending enough money to get there and we all know decipher lost the rights to make the game. They;re just trying to get us to buy all these new cards before they go bust, don't let them do it... Please, R3 should nto be allowed... we all got here playing in the current meta.. why play in a new meta none of us know.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>damnit all! All I hear is people talking about how "decipher has lost the liscence..." Frankly, thins is bullshyte. Decipher has NOT lost the damned liscence. LUCASFILM has put a moratorium on all non episode II stuff effective December or january. Decipher has to put out sets now or there will be no new cards til May. Don't jump to conclusions without the facts.<br>
<br>
Now, as to whether or not RefIII should be used...IT SHOULD. One of the things that has kept me in this game from the beginning and stopped me from playing magic is the fact that in SWCCG, cards are not banned, restricted, or limited in any way other than gameplay aspects like uniqueness. I want worlds to be sanctioned, and I am already buying RIII boxes I ordered when DCon was still going to happen. I want this to be THE REAL DEAL, not some pansy 'tournament' that happens only as certain select people want, people who don't like the variety, who don't like having to actually (God forbid) think when they make a deck and prepare for things. Even though I think the characters we've seen in RIII are broken, there's probably a good reason for it, and we won't know until all the cards are viewable.<br>
<br>
Finally, to finish my rant, I will enjoy playing SWCCG for a long time to come, and those of you that jumped to the conclusion that the game is over and already have cards on ebay, well, I will be laughing at you when I go to DCon 2002 and win the damned thing. Jumping ship like this over rumors is like jumping out of a boeing just because someone tells you the plane landed already...it hasn't and you plummet to yuor death. Well, this game isn't over yet, not by a long shot, but many of you seem to be plummeting out of the SWCCG world without even checking to see if the ride is over.<hr>Praskac said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>No way should r3 be allowed because NO ONE should put another dime into another decipher product!  No on banning cards... NO CARDS SHOULD BE BANNED... in my opinion... well maybe ANGER, FEAR cause that card is so damn powerful!  Other cards like podracing and odds aren't broken and a smart player can always meta against them, banning cards isn't the way to go, but no r3!<hr>don ertan said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>as long as it doesn't come out 2 weeks before the tournament it is fine. Also, decipher is doing what other companies do when they are out of clever ideas. they do some bullshyte. I think the game is awesome. even with errates and crapy attitutdes of players, the game is there. People needs to chill out about how the game sucks and how the game changed over time. NO S H I T. The game will change, it will continue to change. Just like life and the game must go thru changes and it adapts to that. I people quit, oh well, nice knowing you. good luck. have a good life. <br>
<br>
As too R3, it will be better for older players beacuse they dont like to add 30 card counters to a deck. IT will be interesting to see how the older players due with the changes. <hr>edmund said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>maybe d hasn't lost the license but they've lost their credibility and if you think the game isn't dead you're crazy.<br><br>decipher has #&!%ed us again, and again why fall for it any more? stop being holland's b.tch, and forget decipher and r3.<hr>Kroutil said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ref III should be legal.  <br>
<br>
The people who claim that the game is dying are outspoken.  The silent majority of players are NOT quitting.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, the present environment does not promote competetive play.  Decipher designed the defensive shield cards for a reason, to fix what is presently wrong with the game.  Let the game evolve and improve.  <br>
<br>
Any time a new set is released, players become more excited to play trying out new cards and deck types.  Help increase the excitemnt for worlds by allowing Ref III.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to say that the biggest impact Ref II will have on the game will be defensive strategies that make "meta" gaming less annoying.  Very few new decktypes will emerge from Ref III.  <br>
<br>
Ref III will improve the present environment, not create a new one.  <hr>Kroutil said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Many people argue that no cards should be banned, including podracing and numbers.  Why then should Ref III not be allowed?  To not "allow" a legal legitimate set in worlds isdirectly BANNING the cards.  <br>
<br>
Many people want to "ban" reflections III simply because they do not want to spend the money on cards.  Are these good reasons to ban cards?  <br>
I personally cant afford to buy many cards right now, even from Coruscant and Tatooine.  That is my own fault and disadvantage.  I shouldnt limit my fellow card players' options simply because I as an individual dont have enough money.  <hr>DPC Dan said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ahhh... when the sh!t hits the fan watch 'em all squak! Hey there sure<br>
are alot of cynics out there? Fine leave. I don't care. It's time for the new blood. people who play for the fun of it. take your advil, nose bleeding, win at all cost gaming<br>
and take a hike. i'm still gonna play cause I play for fun 1st! That's why I started this game to begin with. And I vote for RFIII to be legal! cause I like the way it looks. and I am curious to see how the enviroment changes.<br>
"So put that in your pipe and smoke it!"<hr>artoo3:16 said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I honestly don't care if it is legal as long as there is a tournament.<hr>BA said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I wish there were normal rules, like magic has. Star Wars is a better game, but the tournament organisation sucks big time... Time for a Star Wars DCI, loose from Decipher.<hr>Info Broker said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>This is a warning.  I just came home from a night of fun, and many of you may not agree with me, but this is how I feel.  I gave this some thought, and I have to say, that...???  Thoughts are spinning.<br>
<br>
But it isn't about the company anymore...it is about our game.  YES our game!!  If you someone important to you was about to die, would you just say, 'screw it, it was going to die anyway, so lets just do the little we can do as possible, and then just let it die'.  You know I do not mean to make it that serious, because it is not, but it is important to me.  <br>
<br>
On a different NOTE, I have two great kids at home, the most wonderful wife in the world, but SWCCG has always been fun for me, and has been apart of my life in a way.  My wife respects that, and I enjoy that, in fact I met many people playing this game.  Many of them will be friends for a lifetime.  I was really, really upset at decipher when they canceled worlds.  In fact I was upset enough to not spend a single penny on them again.  But just like when you are upset with your child...time and thinking makes you think rationally.  It is not about Decipher, it is about my game.  And if it is going to die, then I want to stand by it until its last breathe.  I would be a fool to say this game sucked when I met so many people through this game. Yes make R3 legal, continue the life of this game. Even if it is short lived.  We all have been apart of it.. There is no arguement there.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I will show up to any event, whether sanctioned or not, just because there is many I want to see, and say goodbye to.  Well hopefully, not goodbye forever, but you know what I mean.  I do not feel I just type what I really felt, because of the way I feel(drinking and all)... but this will have to do for now...until later.<hr>Jason'waid'wade said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Podracing and watto have destroyed our local toury. I can't imagine a broke idea at the worlds that would just dominate.I say no just for fun guys.<hr>Baroni said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Im not for banning on certain cards becuase the play einviorment is not that bad right now. You can easily make a deck to counter the common cheesy srategies. But Seriously REF3 does not neeed to be legal. Not only coul it create an unstable einviorment(ops???). But why waste another peny on this diening game just so decipher can make afew bucks before they loose their license<hr>Jeremy 'JerUNH' Oakes said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Reflections III <B>will</b> be legal for Hardcore World Championship! I also believe they should be legal for any world championship of any sort.<hr>Ken Bradford said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I hear the cries of people abandoning the game, not wanting to give "Holland another dime."<br>
<br>
You know, I felt that way too after the cancellation of DCon was announced.  I wondered how Decipher could anger its greatest players that way.<br>
<br>
Then a funny thing happened;  I went to an Ep1 tournament over the weekend.<br>
<br>
Now that's not the funny thing.<br>
<br>
The funny thing was, I was playing, thinking about how the game was dead.  But I was sucked into the mechanics, and I remembered why I had spent so much money on this game in the first place.  It's not that Decipher are marketing geniuses (they're not).  It's not that the game is just Star Wars (it isn't).  I was suddenly relishing every little aspect of the game, from force draining to deploying, to strategic moves.  By my third game against McClure Jr. I was having a blast, and we had a podrace that was so close it didn't end for MANY turns, with both of us alternating interrupts, some bad and good draws...we ended up tied at 22, and Sebulba ripped me a new one.<br>
<br>
What fun that was!<br>
<br>
Hey, wait...isn't this the broken mechaninc everyone's been complaining about?  How come I was having so much fun?<br>
<br>
It struck me then that I love playing this game.  Of all the CCGs I have tried (and there are too many to name them all...Battletech, Middle Earth, NetRunner, Jyhad, Magic, Rage...blabhabhalbhalblah) there has never been any other game that I have played THROUGHOUT.  I have dropped/picked up those other games so many times it boggles my mind, but I have always been there for the next expansion.<br>
<br>
And I remembered, reading the spoilers, all the times I've been excited to see new cards, wondering how they would play and interact with the current decks I had or inspire new ones.<br>
<br>
Don't take that excitement away.<br>
<br>
I may not be able to attend Worlds, but if you deny the new cards, you have taken away a part of the game.  It's a good game, guys.  Seperate it from Decipher and evaluate it on your own.  <br>
<br>
Do you think Decipher is the reason you've been playing this game, after all?<br>
<br>
Just like that crappy baseball movie, do it "For Love of the Game."<br>
<br>
Amen.<hr>PapaLorax said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>well this is absolutely the worse response David could get. it seems to be a total split.<br><br>hopefully, the set won't come out until after October, so that we won't have anything to worry about. but, i don't count on that happening. so the question must be answered. But consider, if you make that legal, there are foil Preview cards and 100 new cards that you have to consider.  It is looking like many of defensive shields will be made to completely destroy many deck designs.  that will give people 2 weeks to prepare once they have the new cards.<br><br>i vote no Ref 3...worlds should not be decided by who can create the best deck in a short amount of time. everything else should be totally legal.<hr>Mike said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>To make a long story short...NO TO REFLECTONS 3 or any other new cards.<br>
<br>
Anyone who doesnt like the current enviroment doesnt have to come to the tournament. Simple. Dont like it? Dont f.ucking play. You wanna talk cheese? Lets start the game with 17 cards already in play...no strategy...no balance at all. Im sick of people whining about podracing. Its been proven that the most dedicated wins. If you are dedicated to your deck with or without it...you can win the game. Either play it...dont play it...but shut the h.ell up about it. There is no need to ban it. How about the guy who plays 5 A Step Backward only to have them all grabbed or sensed? Is that any less cheesy? Im sure alot of guys will have new cool decks built. If you build your deck to just beat Watto...you will lose to something else. If you build to beat Watch Your Step you will lose to something else.<br>
<br>
Stop b.itching...screw decipher...dont spend another nickel on any of their s.hitty products and let them know they made a bad decision. Anyone who says star wars isnt dying is delusional and should seek help. The writing is on the wall. Lets make this last worlds a great one and not with having to build brand new decks a week or two before the biggest tournament of the year. Thats cheesier than any other possibility I can think of.<hr>Ooryl said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I don't think it should be legal.  Many people are using this as a farewell tourney and its unfair to make them shell out more money to be competitive.<hr>MaulStrikes said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>If decipher doesn't sanction a tournament simply because the cards that came out two weeks before are not allowed then they are total asses.<hr>No Mo Money said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I don't have money for this many freaking sets!<hr>Jamie said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I vote no. I probly wont come though, so who cares.<hr>PT said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I don't know about everyone else, but I have been playtesting my decks for a while. I vote no, so I don't have to start over again.<hr>john said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Looks like either way people are gonna be pissed off. So, better to piss off the rich people, who would have bought a case of the stuff.<hr>Steven Brentson said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Might I suggest another reason many of you wish to exclude a new set prior to a major event?<br>
<br>
Complacency.<br>
<br>
Many of you simply do not want to have to adjust for the new environament. Decktech has quietly given each on of you a powerful vote to manipulate the play envirement. Not only have some of you voted to keep new cards away from your simmering pot of WYS and Hunt Down Jizz. Now some of you have also taken this as an opportunity to vote out some currently accepted strategies.<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed of you.<br>
<br>
I won't be attending any Decktech run event that does not run their tournaments based on the current play environment.<br>
<br>
<hr>Van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Yes RefIII should be legal cause the current meta sucksass...<hr>van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>... and brenston hit the nail right on the head....besides new cards and new strategies are one of the best parts of SWCCG...<hr>Freak said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Current meaning including Ref III or not?<hr>True_dat said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>but there is a good chance that the Reflections III meta will suck even worse, and you have to shell out the $$$ to find out... I say screw it.<hr>Van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I mean the CURRENT meta sucks.....ref III should be great...the defensive additions it brings will make the decks a little looser and more fun!...besides, everybody likes to open boxes.. <hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I am thinking that Ref III will not be legal. Which I think will please more people than it will piss off.<hr>Baroni` said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Yes david you are completely right.<hr>Matt said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Banning Ref III is the same as selectively banning cards. Yes there will be some new interesting cards in Ref III. Yes, there might be potential for powerful and, dare I say, broken combos. But there will also be some balancing aspects to the game that are looked forward to by many players. <br><br>I agree with Brentson. Accept the game for what it is. Enjoy the challenge of Ref III possibilities and enjoy the game Decipher, yes Decipher, has made. If you can't do that, then Decktech's substitute Worlds will boil down to a shallow, self-involved shadow of what it could and should be.<br><br>Keep Ref III legal.<hr>Mark` said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>No..one more before Ref.III should make it a monumental Tournie..despite all the people who claim they're not going<hr>Leia said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I'll play either way, but I'm planning on continuing to play after worlds, because I still think the game's fun.  So in my opinion, despite the fact that I am mad at Decipher for cancelling worlds, I think R3 should be legal.  I play the same decks for an insane amount of time, so logically, I shouldn't want R3... but let Decipher lose all their money on Theed.  I'd like things shaken up a bit.  Brentson and Hayes summed things up well.  However, it's your event and your call.<hr>Lbmyers1 said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ref 3 should not be legal.  I guess I can name the 2 reasons everyone else did:  1.  Having to buy 4 boxes of cards to use in only 1 tournament(many many players will have to do this).  2.  Unstable environment.  I dont want to see a deck like operatives from R3 come out of nowhere and win like $1000.  The set doesnt look stable at all, sure there are 34 shields, but what about that new chewie and those power cards.  every game at worlds would just come down to who can win that one big battle.  All the big names dont want R3 except Brian H. and a few others.  Id rather play in a non-sanctioned event  than pay $300 on my boxes to play in a sanctioned one.  Also, you babies need to quit crying over the current environment.  Guess what!?  That WYS shield SUCKS.  WYS is still gonna be everywhere and even more so after R3, escpecially with that chewie.  And its not that bad, I mean we did get insert killers in DS:2 then combo ones in Cor.  And racing is a part of the game no matter how little startegy it takes.  Thats what I think anyway...no R3 plz.<hr>Brian Cieszynski said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>this is a response to Hunter:<br>
<br>
Dude, I find it hard to believe you can't see that there is a difference between disallowing R3 (something Decipher was probably going to do anyway) versus disallowing certain strategies (numbers, podracing, etc).  It seems to me that the really good players are being completely self-serving and trying to disallow certain strategies that allow weaker players to compete.<br>
<br>
If DeckTech illegalizes certain cards, then they take away whatever shred of legitimacy their "World Championship" might have otherwise had.<hr>Hayes said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>brentson is entirely right.  <br>
<br>
to those of you who no longer want to support warren/decipher: <br><br>
that's your deal.  if you are so angered by the company then don't play the game... what's that?  you like the game?  then how can you not like new cards?  as Van mentioned: that's what makes the game interesting and fun and worth while: NOT having to deal with the same crap over and over again. <br>
<br>
to those of you who just don't want to spend any money at all: <br><br>
again, it's your call.  just because you don't want to spend money on star wars cards does in no way imply it's best not to let ref 3 be legal.  you still don't have to buy any. <br>
<br>
to those of you who feel this benefits "the rich":<br>
duh.  the game has always been easier to play/win if you have money.  somehow i've never heard these complaints when other new sets come out... which leads me to my next point: <br>
<br>
to those of you who feel that spending money on a game that may or may not be done in less than a year: <br><br>
so f.cking what?  you can't honestly tell me you didn't think the game would go on forever, did you?  each and every one of has boughten cards damned well knowing the game was going to end someday.  of course you might stop playing because people will start to lose interest etc, but in no way is buying cards now any different than it was 5 years ago.  we all knew it was going to end.  you either enjoy playing this game enough to spend the money on it, or you don't.  stop your whining. <br>
<br>
to those of you who feel these cards are dumb: <br><br>
that doesn't mean they shoudn't be legal.  calling them "dumb" in no way supports and claim that they should not be allowed.  you need to say how the environment would benefit w/o them, or at least how they would hurt it.  the fact is, the current environment is stale.  we also can't say that they'd do bad things for the environment.  you simply can't make that claim.  there is no evidence. <br>
  <br>
to those of you who are too lazy to build new decks: <br><br>
shut the f.ck up.  if you can't build decks in <b>2 weeks</b> then you don't deserve to play this game.  obviously you need to playtest to discover what works and what doesn't.  that is part of the fun of star wars.  trying to figure all the aspects of the new pieces of the puzzle.  the fact is, regardless of whether or not new cards are out before a major event is irrelevant: assuming no broken strategies involved, the top players will ALWAYS finish on top.  of course there are always exceptions to the rule, don't be ignorant. <br>
<br>
to people that whine that "i've been playtesting my decks for weeks now":<br><br>
well, to that i say you're stupid.  we've known for PLENTY of time that ref 3 would be out prior to worlds. <br>
<br>
look.  there are good reasons to not want ref3 out for dcon worlds.  in fact, it's in my best interest to say no to it.  hunter wouldn't be playing, and i've lost only once in my last 32 sanctioned games.  how could i support a new environment, you wonder, when that environment could lead to an end of my success?  my answer:  simple. <br>
<br>
for one, i am confident in my abilities as a star wars player.  i have little doubt i could come up with competitive decks in a night, much less 3 weeks (assuming it even does come out that close), and i have faith that my fellow competitors would be able to do the same. <br>
<br>
secondly, though people say "the current meta sucks" and i disagree, i do know it's time for a change.  it's how star wars works.  new cards come out, everyone tries out new shyte until the dominant decks appear, then the meta is formed, then new cards come and the process starts anew.  that's how it's always been.  and it's what keeps the game alive and interesting. <br>
<br>
have some faith people.<hr>Qui-Gon16 said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I am not usually a vocal member on decktech, however    I do frequent the site as well as Decipher.com.  The fact the many of you who have posted your thoughts on this issue stating that you feel Decipher is out to screw all the players and is merely out to make money is absurd.  If Decipher.com had gone on as planned, then I would have questioned the company and felt that they were out to make money at any cost.  The fact that they cancelled their most lucrative event of the year merely because they felt a sense of responsiblity for what might happen to a player, customer, or employee shows a true character.  I have been playing Star Wars since the day that Priemere debuted and I have always gotten angry when Decipher has missed release dates and the like, however this decision has made me a more firm supporter of Decipher than I ever was before.  They have come out and said that there is more to the world than their products and championship events and have proved it through their immediate move to donate THEIR profits to charity.  I love Star Wars and I have been an active competitor for the entire life of the game so far and I feel that we as a community of players should be patient and stand behind Decipher in their decision because it is a responsible one.  I am not going to abandon the game and those of you that are considering it or even planning to, I hope you reconsider.  Say what you will about the current play environment and Decipher as a company  we are all here because we love the game, don't let your immediate disappointment over the loss of this one event destroy future ones or cloud the fact that Star Wars is something you enjoy.  I am not intending to sound preachy, I am just saying how I feel and I hope some of you agree.  As far as the Worlds go, I will support whatever decision Decipher makes because through this issue they have proven their judgement to me.<hr>Van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Truth is , like HUnter said, if REF III is not allowed----IT IS NOT SWCCG---period. This whole thing about banning and disallowing sets is AGAINST THE RULES.... and that's all there is...<hr>Hayes said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>paul.  to your first point:  no, "many many players" would not have to buy 4 boxes.  i have no intention of buying that many cards.  i don't have the money for it, frankly.  and do you think because of that i will be any less competitive of a player?  no.  i will buy 2 boxes and borrow whatever else i need. <br>
<br>
as to your point about the operatives:  yes, there is always that risk that a broken strategy eeked past playtesting.  that risk is always there.  at the same time, with out having actually seen all the cards, much less played with them, i don't see how you're in a position to say something like that will happen with ref 3.  no doubt, sped had it's troubles.  and has anything like that ever hanppened since?  no.  they learned how to test their products more efficiently.  even if you don't want to accept that, the same argument about not having enough time to prepare applies: the best players always come out on top.  you want to throw matt potter back in my face?  well it's pretty easy to argue that the most "deserving player" has never come out on top, or so clint would have you believe.  the fact remains, despite the operative fluke, the same names were STILL top 12, even if a mofo did win the thing. <br>
<br>
what else you got?  it has to be better than, "the 2 reasons everyone else did," as you put it.<hr>VAN said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>complacent, simmering pot of hunt down jizz.......that's the best, steven<hr>Bomar said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>If you do not allow R3 the tournament wont be sactioned. There for it will not be worlds. All it will be is another DPC event. So if you win you can be the DPC world champ. Wait I thought that is what the DPC finals are for. <hr>PapaLorax said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I am really surprised that so many people want Ref 3. So what about EPP Maul and Qui-Gon, everyone who says if its not sanctioned its not right would agree these guys should be in?<hr>Van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>not allowing  qui or maul w saber is different<br>
cause you can't just go out and buy those, I think...<hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>It's simple. The less money people have to spend to be competitive the more they have to travel to Worlds 2K1. Since we need as many people to show up as possible, in order to pay for the event, it just makes sense to keep the current play enviroment intact. If Decipher wants to help pay for the event, then we can take another look at it.<hr>Henry said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I'm with Brentson and Hayes.  R3 should be allowed, to force us to get back on our feet and play instead of whining about what happens when we don't think and lose.  R3 can resurrect the game, not kill it, if we decide to make it that way.<hr>alien_intelligence said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Sounds like you already had your mind made up David... Why this elaborate poll to make a determination then? Sounds to me like the most rational and reasoned responses have called for keeping R3 legal.<br>
<br>
Fact: Your tournament won't be even close to considered a true World Championships without R3 being legal and without it being sanctioned.<br>
<br>
my $.02<hr>edmund said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>just look at all the work david and neal have done for decipher, and what have they got for it? nothing. why should they help d sell any more cards, when all d does is shyte in their face again and again?<hr>Danny said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I vote Yes.  Banning of Cards and sets in tournament play is one of the worst things ever.<hr>faramir said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Just a suggestion here, that might solve everyone's problems.  1st off, make the tournament non-sanctioned, does anyone really care if it's sanctioned or not?  2nd, allow Reflections 3.  3rd, also allow proxy cards to be played (limit this to only Reflections 3 cards if you want).  No complaints of banning a set, and also no need to buy the new stupid cards for 1 tournament.  Good idea?  If not, why not?<hr>Mike said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I love everyones self serving and c.ocky comments. Its not about the money...its not about the meta...its not about winning....make up your mind...whats it all about? I dont heed the advice of an 18 year old very well who thinks he is a really good player. You all know who you are.<br>
<br>
Qui Gon 16 said Decipher made a good character decision by cancelling dcon? What kinda crack are you smoking? They made a totally self serving decision thats saves them piles of money. They had 50k to shell out to players and now they dont...seems convenient to me but that doesnt really matter...the point is...should we give them any more of our money? I say NO!! Im sure the high ranked players want it to be sanctioned for obvious reasons...if I was 2nd in the world and had a shot to be 1st...I guess I would want it to be sanctioned to.<br>
<br>
Facts are this:  Reflections 3 would throw the whole enviroment into chaos. Some of us dont have all day and night to f.uck around with star wars cards and others cant afford it and go to the tournament. Those of us who can are lucky and we should not tell people to shut the f.uck up and quit whining. David will make a decision based on what he thinks is best for everyone and that will be it. Ive always said there should be a 30 day rule for new cards before a big tournament. It favors those who can sit around for 14 hours a day coming up with rediculous strategies. I personally dont have the time to waste on this s.hit but I would like everyone to see a different point of view.<br>
<br>
Its obvious Hayes Hunter has a serious interest in this whole thing and I understand that..but the attitude is a bit harsh dont you think? Saying things like if you cant build a deck in 2 weeks then you dont deserve to play this game...what the h.ell is that? Its easy to say that when you actually have the time to do it. Some of us have families...real jobs...and responsibility that others dont have and there isnt time to stay up all night screwing around with cards. Ill play either way Im sure and I will find a way to get the needed cards beforehand by buying singles and trading. I will not buy packs or boxes. Ive given Decipher enough money and I think we should really send a message to them by saying no and not buying them before this tournament. Buy them after...fine...waste your money...its ok with me but for a tournament like this...they should not be legal if its less than 30 days before the tournament from a players perspective and shouldnt be legal at all just to send decipher a message that we dont need any more sets this year.<hr>Michael Pistone said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Why the hell do you play this game if you aren't going to adapt and adjust to new cards? Contrary to popular belief you don't have to buy that much of a product to remain competitive in the game.  Hayes is right, I don't see needing to buy more than 2 boxes AT MOST for this, and I think if you are shelling out the money to go on the trip for the tournament you should have the money to pay for 2 boxes.<hr>Chris Kroutil said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Logical reasons to Allow Ref III:<br>
<br>
The tournament would be sanctioned with R3.<br>
<br>
Ref III is a legitamate set.<br>
<br>
Ref III will improve the current environement by making the "meta" less annoying. <br>
<br>
The only other way to improve the environment is to ban (wrongfuly) unpopular cards.<br>
<br>
The silent majority of players are not quitting the game; the players who are quitting the game are outspoken. <br>
<br>
Ref III would have been legal at Decipher-Con and the DPC con was created to replace Decipher-Con<br>
<br>
Players will be excited to try out new cards in a big tournament and therefore more willing to attend. <br>
<br>
Boycotting a set will not help the longevity of the game in the long run. <br>
<br>
<br>
Logical reasons to ban Ref III:<br>
<br>
none. <br>
<br>
Emotional reasons to ban Ref III:<br>
<br>
"I am angry with decipher"<br>
<br>
"Im not comitted enough to the game to actually pay for new cards."<br>
<br>
"I want the game to stay the same and never evolve because I fear change."<br>
<br>
"I dont want to play the game ever again or buy new cards until Decipher promises me that the game will continue on for all eternity."<br>
<br>
<br>
The people who want ref III banned are those who are no thinking logically, but rather emotionally.  These are the ones who are outspoken.  The silent majority are not thinking so emotionally and want to use Ref III. <hr>Mike said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ive been adjusting and adapting all year to get ready for this s.hit and Im p.issed off about everything thats happend however... David is giving us a choice. Ill go either way because Im going up there no matter what...but I dont have to like it...and I dont have to like Decipher. Half of the comments on here are probably Decipher stooges voting to use the cards so you cant fool me. Im not going to buy 2 packs or 2 boxes...I will get what I need and that will be the end of it. Read my post before commenting next time. I will adapt as necessary.<br>
<br>
And no...not everyone can afford $200 for 2 boxes AND the trip. Dont assume so much. Most of these people are kids making 5 bucks an hour. I sympathize with them as well and dont feel like Im above them.<hr>Decipher Blows said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Chris...that is the stupidest thing Ive ever read in my life.<hr>Kroutil said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Also, you dont HAVE to buy many boxes to compete:<br>
<br>
Ref III is a relatively small set<br>
<br>
The distribution of premium cards is equal, there are no 'rare' cards<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, the post- Ref III environment will not be hard to adapt to.  Ref III is primarily a defensive set helping decks to meta-game.  There will not be a vast size of new deck types emerging.  <hr>Decipher eat s.hit said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Chris- That is the second stupidest comment Ive ever heard. <br>
<br>
Stop posting...you have no clue what you are talking about...A defensive set? Have you seen the cards? Seen Boba Fett or Chewie or Lando or The walker....yeah I guess those are defensive cards...sure...pay upkeep on them so they can sit and defend a site...ok...thats good startegy...<br>
<br>
U R STOOPID!!!!!!!!<hr>david.irvine said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Does anyone remember when Reflections 2 first came out? You could go on eBay and buy a set of expanded universe cards for like 20-30 bucks. I'm pretty sure that if anyone doesn't want to spend $100 on a box of foils and expanded universe cards, you can just buy what you need for decks from someone else(probably for less than the price of a box). Reflections 3 should be legal, but everyone doesn't have to go crazy buying a lot of it. Hell, you might even be able to buy it from the dealer(s) at the DPC. It would help to get support from dealers again for any future events. <BR><br>
<BR><br>
R3 should be legal<hr>Chris said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>"You are stupid"?<br>
<br>
Thats a pretty pathetic way of arguing a point and youve just weakened your credibility.  <br>
<br>
The truth is, these new characters will not change the game much.. There are plenty of ways to have high power in a battle and to add lots of destiny draws.  These cards are powereful, but are not broken and will not drastically change the environment.  <br>
<br>
But this is besides the point.  Cards should not be banned before they are even released.  And they should especially not be banned by outspoken whiners with no credibility.  <hr>Chris is a genius said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Ok everyone listen to Chris...he has a really good grasp on the new meta even though he knows nothing about the cards. When I regain my credibility...I wanna be just like you. I would really like some cheese to go with my whine.<br>
<br>
By the way...good points from Irvine.<hr>Jason "Qui-Gon" Keen said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Personally I'm at the point where I think I should save money and wait for LOTR to come out ; P  But thats just me.<br>
<br>
Now the reality is that by making it legal we have a short amount of time to get ready for the new meta . . . for some thats great . . . a better chance for everyone right?  Just remember 1998 worlds when Special edition came out and we had Operative jizz?  I don't even know when Ref 3 is coming out exactly, I havn't seen a date yet.  It could be the week before and that would be hilarious.  I think worlds should be the test of a normal meta that we have been in for quite some time, especially when 10k is on the line?  <br>
<br>
Oh wait a second, D-Con got cancelled (Insert Sarcasm Here)<br>
<br>
Fuck it I'm playing LOTR~<br>
<br>
<hr>Pete Srodoski said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>F.uck that noise... I don't wanna spend another penny on the card game, just have no R3 for all the players that'll make this their last tourney(most of us)<hr>Arthur Garf Unkel said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I think everyone should play Magic.<hr>Chu said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>For those complaining about how this is not going to be a legitimate Worlds without Ref3: welcome to the party. It's not going to be a legitimate worlds no matter how you look at it. If even one person who qualified doesn't come but was originally going to, the event is no longer legitimate. I don't think I can make it anymore if the date is the same because I have other things to do. I guess it's not legitimate anymore.<br>
<br>
To Hayes: I don't really care how many times you've lost in the last X games. Why do you bother throwing these pointless facts in? Nobody cares. Your attitude is annoying.<br>
<br>
David Irvine does have a good point that making Ref3 legal would help support dealers that we've all made contacts with buying our cards. That's the only reason I would support Ref3 being legal. I personally do not believe these cards are legitimate. I honestly think they're purposefully the worst marketing ploy to get people to buy more cards. I know EPPs were, and many cards since the older sets, but I think this one is far worse than others previous.<br>
<br>
For this reason alone, R3 should not be legal. <br>
<br>
Curious observation: I didn't see many complaints during DPCs about their "mulligan" rule. Isn't that changing the rules Decipher laid down? Isn't that making the game less legitimate? Legitimacy is just a tool used for both sides in support for their point. Legitimacy is what you make it. I feel Decipher has abandoned the players so why do we want to hold to their bylaws? If you guys want to pay the taxes on their tea, that's fine. I'm all for throwing it in the harbor. <br>

I agree.<hr>Darth-Elwood said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I cant believe what I a mhearing-dont give Decipher another dime, theyve abandonded us you liars, the ifrst day R3 comes out you will go out and buy 2 boxes like you always do...Anyway, yes make it legal, simply for the sacntioning and if it is REALLY about the game and the fun that all you people are whining about it WON'T MATTER if you lose and don't win money will it?  the only other option I think would be to hold worlds maybe in NOV. give R3 a chance to settle in and find its way into decks on its own, i dont agree with making everyone rush buy the set but if you so DESIRE a world champion so that the game doesn't die, as youve been saying since Special edition then you all better allow it---who cares if you lose I thought it wasn't about money?<hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>What about the playetesters that have known about this set for long time? They will have an unfair advantage over other players, who will not have the needed time to get a good grasp of the new meta.<hr>Van said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>To Chu:<br>

It should be legal if it comes out in time.<hr>wujenta said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I'm from Europe, and I start playing SW 2 years ago. I say yes to reflections III, althought it will be dificult for me to buy the 2 boxes and make a competitive deck in 1 or 2 weeks( I hope that here in Spain we recieve the boxes the first or second week of November). I dont want any cards to be banned, because banning cards was one of the main reason to me for quitting magic.<hr>person in black said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>allow ref III, and allow epp quiggy and maul. Lets get this thing sanctioned, and not waste our time.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>First off, while I want to support Decktech and all the work they are doing, if its not sanctioned, I won't go. Its like hayes said: many of us play for the honor of having whatever happens happen. If players pussy out at the last minute because they are afraid of losing ranking or not winning the whole thing, well tough shyte. You were going to have to put all that on the line at DCon anyway. If this is to be a real effort, then it must be sanctioned, and all cards must be legal. I will be happy to see many of you at feedomCon otherwise (note:same time, same place as DCon was to have been). But I will not support a nonsanctioned piece o crap tourny that caters to certain people. Like Hayes, I have a winning record with the current meta (20-0) and would be hurt by a new meta possibly. But you know what, we play STAR WARS, not some thing that consists of only part of it.<br>
<br>
allow RIII, or be boycotted by NC. Period<hr>chemjon said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>R3 all the way.  Its always good to expand the playing field and bring in new strategies.

We fight amongst ourselves, we accuse each other of all sorts of things.  Meanwhile they stick to their guns, always spout out the party line and that is why they win.  We are weak, they are strong, we are spineless, they take advantage of our spinlessness.  It's sad but true.  All of you who want to continue to be pulled along in their little money-milking scheme can do what you want, but I really see no good reason to force other people to be pulled along with you.  Many people want to quit this game after this final tournament and don't want to spend 1 more stinking dime on the company that dicked them over.  Can't you respect that?<hr>Martin Akesson said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I think ref 3 should be allowed if it is out in time, even though i dont like the thought of spending money on decipher products anymore. to be honest, i am looking forward to the shield cards.<hr>David said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>So Hunter, Brad and Val. Are you saying that you would come to the tournament if Reflections III is allowed? Assuming the tournament is in the same location and date as DecipherCon was to be?<hr>Chris Hunter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br><b>I believe R3 should be legal.</b><br>
<br>
I agree with the complacency arguement.  I mean hell if you want a new and different environment, you could have an EP1 world's too.  I mean, what the hell huh?<hr>Hunter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>To lbmyers1:  As people like Hayes pointed out, there's no way everyone would need to buy 4 boxes.  I have never bought 4 boxes, or even 3 boxes, of any set for this game, EVER.  And I wouldn't be about to start now.  2 boxes will do the job just fine.  As far as what you say, about most of the big name players being against R3, with me being the only real proponent, I have to disagree strongly.  For starters, Hayes Hunter agrees with me, so there's the top 2 players in the world already.  throw in bastian winkelhaus, matt lush, and david irvine, and we've already accounted for a full 1/3 of the world's top 15.  We're also supported by martin akesson (I don't think anyone can argue that he's the best European player outside of Germany), and Steve Brentson, who has played more games than anyone else.  I'd say these are some notable names.  <hr>Voice of Reason said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>I think it should be period there really is not anything that is earth shattering if people do not play abusive deck those that are going to buy it anyway can use them at will and those that do not wish to buy can play decks that are still great but not abusive.  Besides do we really want someone to win a World championship and then quit the game.  If you are not going just because they will allow RIII then you should not be in the game anyway.<hr>Xzilen said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>And no...not everyone can afford $200 for 2 boxes AND the trip. Dont assume so much. Most of these people are kids making 5 bucks an hour. I sympathize with them as well and dont feel like Im above them. <br>

<br>
Thank You! <hr>Hunter said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>To David:  I certainly understand your concerns about getting as many players to attend as possible.  But it seems that quite a few of the people who say they won't buy reflections III are also saying they wouldn't attend a world championship event either way anyhow.  So their votes are not really relevant to your decision.  So I don't think you should disregard the opinions of all of us who are saying that we could afford to travel to the event (whether we buy r3 or not), but simply WILL NOT play if something is not done to fix the current play environment.  the NC crew seems to be putting their foot down, saying they will not play at all if Reflections III is not allowed.  I am not quite that picky.  I would be satisfied with either the banning of inserts and podracing, or with Reflections III being allowed.  And here is another option that sounds reasonable to me:  Faramir suggested the use of proxies for R3 cards.  A good starting point, but not practical since games would last longer, as everyone would need to check the actual game text of the proxied cards all the time.  What MIGHT work, however, would be just allowing the two def shield starting effects ("fear is my ally", and the light side counterpart), and the defensive shield cards themselves to be proxied.  the rest of R3 would not be legal, just those 2 effects, and the defensive shield cards.  The people who had bought R3 could use the actual defensive shield cards, and the other people could proxy them.  (many of the def shield cards could easily be proxied with the original versions of the card)  So that's another format I would agree on, even if it meant playing in an unsanctioned event.  In answer to the question you asked me, yes, if R3 was legal, I would most likely play the event, even if that meant having to travel out to VA.  However, I still feel that Vegas is easily the best venue.  Everyone knows that flying to Vegas is cheaper than travelling to Norfolk/Va beach, plus it is easy to find cheap lodging (just check Tim "Info Broker" Guzman's member page), and the weather will be better, and there are plenty of entertaining things to do there.  I'll admit, the debate over R3 has been a close one.  I was hoping there would be overwhelming support in favor of R3, but there has not.  However, the debate over which location the players would prefer has NOT been close at all.  There were several votes for Orlando, a few for Normal, IL, VERY FEW for Virginia, but the number of people choosing Las Vegas was easily greater than all other cities put together.  If you want high turnout, Vegas is the place to be.  But if I HAD to play in Virginia, I would, assuming it was one of the 3 formats I have agreed to.  (1: R3 is legal.  2: R3 is not legal, but the defensive shield cards ARE, and may be proxied by the players who don't have them. 3: R3 is not legal, but inserts and podracing are banned)  I hope this answers all of your questions.  If not, feel free to email me.<hr>--Lewis said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Well, I'm not going (obviously!), but if it's cheesy already, you might as well get some new cheese instead of the same old rotten stuff.  (In other words, I'd say yes)<hr>B said on Tue Oct 9 2001 <br>Im not sure if anyone will get to read this seeing as the amount of responses but here it goes...<br>
<br>
Ive played star wars since the release of dagobah.  I must say that the game has come quite a long ways since then.  After hearing about and reading about the new RIII cards I feel that many people are upset at what decipher is doing.  maybe they should be.  Yet if you read the difensive sheilds that they have posted, they are not direct counters to deck strategies.  <br>
<br>
So what if now my WYS deck cant play its lost interupts twice or more times.  The deck will still function.  Its not as if Decipher is making a card that will, only allow HB to deplay three systems.  Thats just absurd.  If your deck cant function with the release of these new defensive sheilds then your deck must not be very good.<br>
<br>
For another example: lets say my opponent has his anti-WYS difensive sheild out.  I have han and lando at a site. then I have outrider and pulsar skate (with there respectable pilots) at tatoine system.  4 smugglers on table.  Luke is at an adsacent site to han and lando.  at the same site my opponent has mighty jabba, chall, and boelo.  If ive played RLR already i am @#$%ed. but the inteligent player would realize when is realy the right time to play thier interupts.  Also one of the greatest bonusus of WYS is the destiny adders and extra generation.  So its not as if they are takeing away the entire point of playing a certain objective but they are making it a more even game for newbies who dont know how to counter strategies yet. thus providing more competition which is greatly needed at this time.  and as stupid as countering sabbac may sound a good sabbac deck (which there is one in my area) will not be hurt the least by the defensive sheild.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion I feel that by allowing and accepting RIII mewbies will be much more competetive and the old pros will be even more challenged to find ways for thier decks to work.<hr>neal said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I want to take this opportunity to give a #&!% you to brad reinhold.  boycott us all you want, you sorry ass bitch.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>here is the format that I will agree to, and since I am driving the majority of the raleigh area players/ working out transportation, I feel I can speak for them. We will travel to a DPC event in some remote portion of the world if we have to. We want to support you 100%. However, more than that, if this is to be the last major tournament of SWCCG, which I sincerely doubt, I want it done right, and sanctioned. I will not drive 4000+ miles to be a part of a mockery of one of the major aspects of my life, and the lives of many friends. I hate to do this, but we must tell you how we feel, since that is the reason for this post. NC (except maybe charlotte, but prolly them too) will NOT attend a non sanctioned DPC world event. SC will not either. Being in touch with the NC state champ and being the SC state champ, this knocks out a decnt proportion of players, probably along the lines of 15-45 all toegether, more like 30 though). We simply do not have the time or the money to mess around and have a fake world championship event. I personally may attend anyway just to see old friends, but I know most of the crew won't travel that far, and we certainly won't pay admision if we aren't playing. Sorry guys.<hr>Kroutil said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>"the debate over R3 has been a close one. I was hoping there would be overwhelming support in favor of R3, but there has not"<br>
<br>
I disagree with you Hunter.  The silent majority of players supposrt Ref III.  The few that oppose Ref III are outspoken.  The results of this 'vote' do not reflect how the majority of people feel.  The few people that oppose Ref III are more angry with Decipher and use this site as a place to whine.  <hr>neal said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>let me repeat... Fuck you Reinhold, you sorry ass #&!%.<hr>twigg said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>If you are gonna do this - do it right... <b> MAKE REFL 3 LEGAL!!!</b><hr>Greg Heisler said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br><b>REFELECTIONS 3 SHOULD BE LEGAL<b><br>
<br>
I believe that new cards have always made the game more fun.  If we are going to play in a World Championship, then it should definitely should be sanctioned.  I also think there should be some look into having Type 2 stuff.  <hr>Brad Reinhold said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>look neal, don't take it personally. I'll still support any worlds, whether promoting it or whatever. You asked opinions, so i gave mine. If you don't like it, don't ask. <hr>edmund said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>the proxy idea is cool, but i don't think it would work, unless maybe dpc people set a format for them or something. dpc worlds is not a legitimate worlds in the first place, so david can choose whatever the #&!% he wants and all of you should be thankful for it. i wish all of you would stop being decipher's b.tches and show them we mean business for once, instead of letting them dictate everything. how do you know r3 won't make things worse? remeber when SE was released right before worlds? it #&!%ed worlds up.<hr>Hunter said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Okay, I think the way that Twigg has chimed in will pretty much finish off Paul's argument that most of the top players are opposed to R3, particularly if his brother shares that opinion (and they usually seem to agree on the issues that come up at this site)  That would make at least 6 of the world's top 10 in favor of R3, while only 1 of the world's top 10 has spoken out against R3 in this thread.  So I think that particular debate can be laid to rest.  Meanwhile, to Kroutil:  You may be right, there could very well be a "silent majority" who is in favor of R3, while only a disgruntled few denounce it.  But I cannot be entirely certain of that, so I was admitting that the comments posted HERE seem to be fairly even.  But what I WAS completely certain of, is the fact that the "voting" that has taken place on decktech, was a landslide victory in favor of using Las Vegas as the location.  But we'll just have to see what David's response to my prior post is like.<hr>Hayes said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>to whoever said no one complains about the mulligan rule: that rule does not effect the sanctioned part of the DPC so that point doesn't have any baring on the current matter. <br>
<br>
edmund said: "how do you know r3 won't make things worse? remeber when SE was released right before worlds? it #&!%ed worlds up." <br><br>
i've already adressed this.  first of all we don't know that ref3 wouldn't screw things up, but at the same time you are in no position to think that it will.  this is not 1998.  in 98, the worlds didn't get screwed up because the cards were released 2 days before: they gave us the spoiler list about a 10 weeks prior and then several boxes a couple weeks before.  decipher recieved calls from many different players all requesting about 10-15 of various operatives.  worlds that year was bad because they didn't catch the broken strategy.  they learned from that.<hr>Patchell said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Jesus Christ, too many of you guys have no lives!  Why not write a novel with what your saying?  Now, listen up, to that CLOSE MINDED IDIOT who keeps bagging on Kroutil, nobody bags on kroutil more than me, but if you actually reads his comments with a clear head, you will see that chris is absolutely right.  Your just such a cheap mother beeper your letting your hatred cover up whats what.  Get a life buddy, play the wars or get out!<hr>Black 7 said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Neal-You did ask for opinions, weather you agree with Reinhold's opinion or not, at least act like an adult about it.<br>
As for mine, I say FUCK Decipher, they no longer care about their customers, so why should we line their pockets.  While the arguments for Reflections III are very good and valid, I still feel screwed by Decipher, and will no longer give them my money.<br>
I hope that many of you that are of the same opinion will do the right thing and send Decipher a message, stop screwing with their customers, or we stop buying their product, and they go out of business.<hr>Brandon said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Whynot?  Im going to buy it anyways....i think...either way, i want it to be sanctioned<br>
<hr>Elvis said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I say let the Defensive Shield cards be legal ONLY.  It doesn't matter if not everyone can get the cards, because the few who do will make it certain that the strategies the Defensive Shield cards are designed to stop will not be played.<br>
<br>
  This will stop the annoying, abusive strategies we all hate and still allow people to not buy R3 and play effectively.  <br>
<br>
  I don't think R3 should be allowed because I forsee some real powerful decks built around the new dueling decks.  Combine this with the Def. Shield cards and there may be no equal.<hr>don ertan said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>i have to agree with patchell. this game takes money. take it or leave it<hr>veez said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>having the shields is probably a good idea, but I'm not liking the new characters with upkeep <hr>Figy D said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>This is a game, indeed a style of game, that is designed to foster creativity.  It regenerates this sense of such by changing the game at determined periods.  It is given that Decipher is in no way encouraging cheese.  I also do not think the game will die dispite Decipher's poor dicisions.  As for those who wish to save money, why do they think they should be "grandfathered" into tournaments following a change of rules by the legitimate ruling body?  Such an arrogent assumption has been made.  One may agree or disagree, but Decipher has established rules concerning this very topic.  It is fine to break them for "themed" tourneys, but any "world championship" should be established in such a manner as to ensure its legitimacy.  It is rational that it would therefore be necessary to follow the rules created by the organizational body.  Otherwise, who is Decktech to decide what the rules for the SWCCG tourney are to be?  It is necessary for RIII to be legal and playable for any legitimate world championship of the game of SWCCG, including this one.<hr>crzybkhd said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I agree with the top 10 players in world. R3 s/b LEGAL. <br>
<br>
Why not? <br>
<br>
BTW Hayes or Hunter if your ever in Michigan let me know. We'll hit some clubs, kick some brews, etc. and so forth. You sound like you got your head on straight unlike most of the b!tches here.<hr>Figy D said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>sorry about the spelling<hr>neal said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I didn't ask for one goddamned opinion, not here at least.  All I see is a bunch of people saying things like they'll boycott a tournament that david and i are having to put out heavy money and time to have or organize.  Then I see others trying to force their opinions down david's throat.  You have no idea how incredibly furious this makes me.<br>
<br>
I was the one on david hard to do this right from the get go, but now I see I made a mistake.  It's not worth any investment of time or risk of decipher #&!%ing david over at the last minute(which I can nearly be sure they'll do) to hear a bunch of spoiled ingrates whine.  <br>
<br>
I mean some of you are just so uncool that it sickens me.  When someone tries to do you a favor, you don't stick it to them.  If someone lends you $100, you don't say "give me $500 or I won't be your friend anymore".  I mean don't you all know this?  Do you have any clue how to be cool or at least normal?  You all should be thanking me and moreso david for even considering this.<br>
<br>
I mean read some of the opinions on here, not just the reinholds and black 7's even by guys like Hayes.  What happened to you, man?  Weren't you like fairly cool just a little while ago?  Now you are the most opinionated arrogant pushy guy on here cause you had a good year.  Fuck reflections III legal or no.  It's half you guys' mother#&!%ing attitudes.  You can give an opinion without being a total dick, read Info Broker's post on how to be cool and give your 2 cents.  Geez, and he's #&!%ing cooler drunk than half you dorks.<br>
I'm telling you if this somehow goes off, and I'm there and you've tried to boycott DT or something or #&!%ed with me like nathan planters peanuts brown, I'm not letting you in.  I'm gonna take your worthless $25 and throw it in your goddamn face, you can keep your shyte money.<hr>Stormcrow said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I'm not looking forward to spending money, but, then again, I never have been. I still do, though, because I like the cards. I like the game. I like the sanctioned tournaments. If we can get "Worlds" to be sanctioned, well, duh, let's do that. People are going to have RefIII in their collections whether or not DeckTech chooses to allow its use in the tournament, so I say let people use the cards they buy. And if people don't want to buy them? Fine. They'll just need to build their decks and prepare for the meta without them. That's been done before, too...<hr>DarkLord said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I vote no to R3 because I hate having  five seconds to get used to strategies and then change it all up again. I am finally comfortable in the current enviroment and broke for starters.<hr>D said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>David - In response to your comment about playtesters having an unfair advantage...<br><br>
This set was never sent to the playtesters.<br><br>
Decipher did it all 'in-house'.<br><hr>Brad Reinhold said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Dude, sorry. I mean that: I am sorry for reacting to this the way I (we) have. guess we all get kinda carried away. I mean it. Its not a good excuse for turning into a bunch of #&!%ards, but then there really isn't one. I really appreciate all you guys are doing. I appreciate you guys trying to do this right. We will not 'boycott' you, or anything like that. There are a lot of people who feel very strongly about this game. I just wanted it done right, and I went too far. All I really wanted to say was this :Please don't make this game what magic has become. Thats basically all that we want here. thats it. no fancy language or bullshyte. Just keep it star wars. Thanks. <hr>Praskac said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>PLAYTESTERS did recieve r3 and they all have text on the cards as we speak.  How do I know this... cause i have copies of the cards as well, just my sources must remain secret.  <hr>playtester said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Praskac, you don't know jack. Playtesters never worked on half the new cards. The other half are the defensive shields.<hr>VG said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>well, shyte. if that isn't a marketing ploy, i don't know what is. i always thought blizzard 4 was a little bit too strong to get by even those dumb testers<hr>other playtester said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>i talked to others of us, and none recieved non defense shield cards<hr>Praskac said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>playtester, i never said anything about working on the cards, i'm saying they have copies of the cards RIGHT NOW.

anyways if the cards weren't sent to the playtesters then decipher is really pulling a fast one on us... wtf? <hr>faramir said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Oh no, NC and SC will boycott a non-sanctioned worlds, whatever would you do w/out them?  No offense to anyone who plays there, but I spent a few years playing there, and trust me, no one would notice if NC and SC didn't show up.  Nothing I've seen, heard or read from that area makes me think now is any different.<hr>Mystikal said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>you guys are funny. who cares if it is legal or not, just show up drunk and puke on yourself. If you remotely like the game you'l show up without complaining. If you don't show up because of some sort of rule that comes up, then I guess you probably wouldn't have won anyways.<hr>Smokes said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Neal, I think that the people who said they would "boycott" are simply saying that they will or will not show.  Thats the whole purpose of this vote, isnt it?  Theyre being honest and saying if they will go or not go.  I dont think you guys need to take offence to it.  <br>
<br>
The truth is, everyone who plays swccg appreciates Decktech for helping make up for Worlds, whether they will go or not go.  And if someone feels strongly about allowing a set in the tournament, theyre going to explain why.  <hr>Pukester said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Many people dont want R3 to be in allowed in Worlds because they dont want to have to buy cards for just one set.  Maybe if there was an R3 SEALED DECK tournament held the day before, people would agree to actually accept the cards. <hr>Black 7 said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Listen Neal-Read my post before you go off insulting me again, I said that you guys asked for everyones opion, their input on the issue, and that it is wrong that you go off insulting people because you don't agree with their opinion.<br><br>I said what I think about Decipher and Reflections III, I did not slander you or Decktech, hell, I've said it before that if you guys do this it is a great thing since Decipher seems intent on screwing over the players.  So you should stop being so one tracked and start actually listening to what people say before passing judgement on those folks.<hr>Matt Guinn said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>To follow up on Brads comments about NC...  The tournament must be sanctioned in order to get us off our collective asses.  Brad still has much anger in him and must learn control, but he certainly is responsible for energizing the possible attendees. <br>
<br>
My personal opinion...  if its not sanctioned then it doesn't count.  Your already attempting a difficult thing by holding a world event without the direct invlovement of the sanctioning body.  For continuity and accredidation R3 should be allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>Hayes said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>to VG: <Br><br>
until you actually play with the cards and see how they react in the new environment (not how they would react in this one) i suggest you don't go making claims about cards being broken.  many people said the same thing about blizzard 4 when juz showed it at edgecon (along with about a dozen others, including the yoda, praskac) and he just laughed.  look at the new light objective.  you think it's going to be hard to get a dark jedi out in the first place?  you think it's advantagous to have to deploy vader to an exterior site first, then move him inside to flip them back?  beyond that, the imperial can't help in battle that turn.  he is forced to be a passenger.  and then you must deal with the cards upkeep.  yes it's a powerful card, there is no doubt about it, but so what?  it's just one card that lets you get a free vader.  there is another card that gets you a free executor.  that saves you like a turn.  and there are still cards like clash of sabers and power pivot. <br>
<br>
to neal and chu: <Br><br>
i'd like to apologize for the way i've come across lately.  i'm taking all these philosophy courses that have made me more arguable, but i've yet to figure out how to word things accordingly.  i know the tone my arguments often take.  and i'm sorry for that.  the only reason i brought up my record or whatever in recent days was to prove a simple point, not to say "i'm better than you."  i wanted to show that playing the game as it should be played is more important to me than playing it any other way, even when that other way would clearly benefit me. (i.e. with no ref 3 i am in a pretty good spot, with it, on the other hand, there is the risk that i don't find the right decks and don't do as well)<hr>Martin Akesson said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>a way to decide that i think is quite fair is a majority vote among all qualifyers. (girard should have most of the adresses of those that are interested in going, right?). <br>
<br>
I think some kind of proxy idea is a good option otherwise.<hr>Mike said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>What a huge bunch of p.ussies on this web site. First...your going crazy with your opinion on weather R3 should be legal or not and why and what you will do if it is or isnt and then when someone confronts you about it you cower like a bunch of f.ags. What a crew of limp d.icks.<br>
<br>
I warned all of you in the last string of comments about possibly having a substitute worlds...DO NOT f.uck with David or Neal on this. Ill tell you what...these guys are about 2 seconds away from telling you all to f.uck yourselves...not holding a tournament...and crashing the web site forever. I cant believe the patience these guys have had putting up with your egos and comments.<br>
<br>
Some of you all really need to grow up...get a life...and realize that this game is just not that important. You think Matt Lush cares weather R3 is legal or not? No he is thinking about weather or not he will get crammed into a c-130 and shipped over to Wastelanistan or Indonesia or some other god forsaken place to go to a real f.ucking war!!!<br>
You actually think he cares about defensive shields or not? Get over yourselves.<hr>Mike said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Do you guys realize that Decipher no longer cares about rankings or you as players unless you buy Lord Of The Rings.<br>
<br>
So having it sanctioned is meaningless...so stop complaining...play in the tournament and if you are any good you will win..and be the last and final world champ.<hr>The Maker said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Funny thing... if you are all so mad at Decipher, why are you wanting to spend more money on their game? Or play the game? Or turn up at an unofficial world championships.<br>
<br>
I will buy reflections III, I won't go to a world championships, and Decipher will get their money from me, most likely. <br>
<br>
From my perspective... <br>
<br>
Worlds should be sanctioned,... decipher run or not... therefore, reflections III should be legal. The only situation where this should not apply is if Reflections III is released 10 days or less before worlds is scheduled, in which case, Deciphers own rules should be applied. <br>

Mark<hr>What are you stupid? said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>No you must work for Decipher to have a comment like that.<br>
<br>
F.uck you and f.uck Decipher. I hope you waste so much money on R3 cuz its gonna be worthless.<hr>Steven Lewis said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>No Ref3.  I don't care if you ban anything or not.  Those are my votes.<hr>Lbmyers1 said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Brad, boycotting a decktech event is just stupid.  i could understand if it was decipher though.  I think we should all just chill out.  Obviouslly there arent as many top name players wanting no r3 as i thought so i stand corrected.  sure i dont want R3 but ill attend the event either way.  the only way i wont be able to attend is if its in Vegas.  And Brian H. i dont see why you think more people would come if its in vegas.  I havent seen more people on decktech screaming vegas but maybe i just missed them all.  lets hope neal and david dont just sick of all this whining and complaining and cancel the entire thing altogether.<hr>faramir said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Why do you care if your tournament is sanctioned by Decipher?  Do you realize how little they matter?  Grow some damn balls of your own and realize that you don't need big Decipher to tell you what is right and what is wrong.  If you want Ref3 for a legitimate reason then say so, but please consider the thoughts of those who don't want it.<hr>vanashyteoo said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>i will make it legal<hr>Voice of Reason said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Has anyone actually looked at the new mains. If they ain't broke, I don't know what is. Beat-down city.<hr>Voice of Reason said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Has anyone actually looked at the new mains. If they ain't broke, I don't know what is. Beat-down city.<hr>H2O said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>No, the cards are not broken, you can really only play 1 of the new main, because if you want to play all of them you will have to pay liek 12 force to keep them on the table everyturn.  fett is good but you can always barrier and runaway or dodge and run away ect...<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>personaly i think numbers are more broken than this stuff...they've had more time to be abused, and facilitated in winning strategies at worlds for a long time. These new characters are strong, yeah, but they cost a ton. like justin said, too expensive for more than a very small number of them<hr>Trendkill said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Allright, everyone else put in a comment, so I will too. First and formost, IT'S A FREAKING GAME!!! Most of you act like this is life or death! If the game is no longer fun, then quit it and you pissing and moaning. Second, every game in history is a strugle to see who comes out on top, "may the best man win". I've been playing since Hoth and i've seen decks come and go. Does anyone rember those times? How decks would fade in and out as new sets came out? Big D is a company, they are not your friend, and they never will be! They are in it for the $$$ and you would be too if you made a living off printing 26 versions of Darth Vader! Big D just makes the cards, the players make the game! And right now I agree the game sucks! Not because of big D, but because of the players. Yes i've seen my fill of Podracing, yes i've seen my fill of numbers, yes i've seen my fill of big frigging guys with lightsabers! So you know what? I took a break from the game! Everyone I seem to play acts like they have a lightsaber up where the sun don't shine...that is all but... the kids!!! They still rember that it is a GAME, they still know how to have FUN. Rember what that is folks? That feeling you had the first time you got lucky enough to hit Vader with Leia? Or won a game? Or lost a good game to a better player? Ahhh, I see some of you rember. As for the rest of you, if it isn't fun then why do you waste your time and mine even playing it? I can think of a thousand things you can do other than ruin a great game for the rest of us! So as for the answer to the question, yes! Allow R3. To those who don't like it, I say stay home. To those who cannot afford it then I say good luck! Not having cards doesn't mean it won't be fun! If you are going for any other reason than to have fun then I pitty you. Rember, the players make the game, not the cards!<hr>Warren Holland said on Fri Oct 12 2001 <br>Ahaaa-Ahaaa.  Oh yes, by all means make it legal.  This is wonderful!  I love being able to do anything I want.  I can use and abuse you and you keep coming back for more.  You are just mindless fools, and I'm getting filthy rich off your idiocy.<br>
I've got a great idea.  Let's make Theed's Palace legal as well!  Oh ho ho ho.  More money for my hookers.  Just keep giving me money, I'll keep treating you the way you deserve.<hr>Scott Latham said on Fri Oct 12 2001 <br>Not buying Ref3<br>
 i) to spite D or<br>
 ii) in anticipation of the end of sanctioned play <br>
is a bit silly as you risk 'cutting of your nose to spite your face'. Buy it if you want those cards & allow it at DT worlds if everyone will have it by then and it will improve the play. IMHO i think it will improve the play just by forcing us all to think!<hr>Chafin said on Fri Oct 12 2001 <br>I think Ref. III should be legal for the World championship. The whole point of Star Wars is to have fun right? Well what better fun is it to experiment with a new set with a little risk involved? I do realize the not everyone has the money to buy Ref. III and make it to the Con. Personally I don't think I'll be able to do both, but that shouldn't make it so others can't use Ref. III cards. Besides you don't need a whole set to be competitive, buy what you can afford and try to trade or borrow the rest. If it is a true World championship everything should be legal. Some of u people are whining its not fair, well life isn't fair so deal with it. And as for some of you that think that Star Wars is a dying game. Maybe it is or maybe its not we will see what the future has to offer, may big D will recover from its mistakes. And even if it doesn't I will still play Star Wars CCG with my friends. Like I said before you play for fun right?<hr>Michael Rogers said on Sat Oct 13 2001 <br>Although i cant attend the event anyway(university) i think that you have to allow RIII.Anything that brings the game forward is a good thing...and besides,surely the best players in the world can cope with making new decks!<hr>Douglas said on Sat Oct 13 2001 <br>  The Defensive Shields improve game balance too much to leave them out.  Without them, stupid crap may rule the day instead of real SW play, and podracing will be all over the place.<hr>Tha Skank in the Fishtank said on Sat Oct 13 2001 <br>Man you guys need to stop bitching onthis #&!%ing decktech, I mean damn, Decktech seems to feed off of decipher like a parasite, it's sad in a way, all I hear is fools who want to quit after this tourney blah blah. Quit now, no one wnts to see you jackasses there anyway, sell your cards, buy a gun and gobble it till you start to puke, and pull the trigger you useless piles of S hit, or better yet, SUCK IT. Oh yes, Make R3 legal, it separates the good players from the shytety ones who bitch about new sets constantly. <hr>Phobos said on Sun Oct 14 2001 <br>Hmmm... seems it's getting on and off topic here... I personally will play in this worlds thing either way, w/ or w/out Ref 3, since I'm still going to buy the cards anyway. I'm Matt Berta, in Vegas, rating 2019, ranked 63rd in world last time I checked (today Oct 14) and I qualified for Day 2 (in case that matters to anyone). I really only wanted to goto DCon to meet all the players I've talked to online, to hang with everyone I met at Ramapo and other cons, and to get really stinking drunk, after I played my Wars games. Oh, and also to see about some LOTR stuff. It's about the fun, the game, not whether you WANT to support the company. Lets just all go and have a great time like we originally planned before Yo Mamma Ben Laden went and fuct w/the USA. Who's with me?<hr>mystikal said on Sun Oct 14 2001 <br>I'm blah bah blah, # blah in the blah... who cares? at least there's a worlds now<hr>H2O said on Sun Oct 14 2001 <br>I'm with berta...<hr>Patrick said on Sun Oct 14 2001 <br>I don't think that R3 should be banned from the world. The difference between SWCCG and MTG has always been that as soon as the card is released, its legal for tournament play in SWCCG. MTG, on the other hand, has a 30 day window from the release date that they are not legal in sanctioned tournaments. And as far as banning any card from tournament play, MTG fell into that pitfall long ago. Now instead of maing a card to counter the first card,like SWCCG does, MTG just restricts or bans the card. Always nice to see that happen after you trade to get them and they are only 2 months old. <br>
<br>
I do wish decipher would slow down a litte on reeasing new sets. WOTC did the quick set releases and all it really did was run of most of the casual tournament players. <hr>Chris Kroutil said on Mon Oct 15 2001 <br>I understand that there are many people who are worried about Reflections III being in the worlds because of a possibly chaotic environment, just like what happened with opperatives when Special edition came out. <br>
<br>
After reading the spoiler, I dont think Reflections III will create an environment of choas.  First of all there are not that many cards to begin with.  The new objectives encourage interaction between characters which is good for the game.  The new mains, while powerful, are not broken because they have a big set-back.  Mains producing "Beat downs" are nothing new to the game if you look at cards like Jedi Presence, You are Beaten and Courage of a Skywalker. <br>
<br>
Many people will have to travel far for this event, so money is a big issue.  People will not have a lot of money to spare to buy very many new cards.  Furthermore, Deciphre has released so many sets lately that its starting to add up. <br>
<br>
The "staples" from Reflections III shouldnt cost too much to get, however.  People will only need to buy 11 cards from the set for each deck; the starting effects and 10 shields.  These cards will be easy to trade for or buy because NO ONE will need multiple copies of these cards.   <br>
The other new cards, like the mains, are not necessary if you dont want to use them.  Old versions of mains have advantages that these dont.  <br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, I symathize with people who dont have a lot of money spare for these cards, Im one of them.  But like with Tatooine and Coruscant, I didnt have to buy many cards.  I still use my old decks, with a few added the few "staples" from the new sets, like the Battleship Bridge, we must accelerate our plans, Keder the Black and the new grabbers.  <br>
<br>
So to conclude, please don't worry about Reflections III costing too much or putting the game into chaos.  <br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
