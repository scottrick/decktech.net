<b>Accomplished Players</b><br />
<br />
Not all players make money playing TCGs. Unlike the Vs. System TCGs, most other collectible games do not offer professional circuits. UDE recognizes that there are thousands of extremely talented players who play great games that just don't offer a professional circuit. UDE offers a chance to the top players from each game to have a shot at the UDE Pro Circuit.<br />
<br />
This category also includes top players from games other than TCGs, including Poker and Chess.<br />

<b>Most Interesting TCG Personalities</b><br />
<br />
Many players have made a name for themselves with their interesting personalities and charisma. Some of these include the top TCG Internet strategy or editorial writers with a large fan base. Strategy writers contribute a lot to the TCG community and are appreciated.<br />
<br />
These "fan favorites" add something to any tournament they attend. TCG fans are extremely important to UDE; therefore, we are extending invitations to these players as a way to make things a little more interesting to the fans. UDE will always save a few "personality" invitations to the Pro Circuit, to keep things interesting for the fans.<br />

<b>Top Senior TCG Judges</b><br />
<br />
Judges are important to TCGs. They typically work long hours, sometimes with little compensation for the excellent work they do. Good judges are one of the main reasons TCGs stay popular in a region. UDE is extending invitations to the most experienced and well-respected TCG judges in the world.<br />

 <hr><b>comments</b><hr>Andrew Howard said on Sat Jul 10 2004 <br>Sorry if I missed anyone on the list, I tried to locate all the members on the list I could.<br />
<br />
Can't say I'm completely impressed with this list, I guess it has a lot of names that tell you the people comprising the list don't exactly know that much about other games, but what can you do. There are a lot of people who definitely deserved it on this list, and congrats to them.<br />
<br />
For anyone who didn't make it, there's always PCQs!<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Jul 10 2004 <br>Any reason david akers is invited and i'm not? That's pretty retarded. Are they under the mistaken impression David actually does stuff with dt?<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Jul 11 2004 <br>Apparently, not quite sure where they got his name from, but it's one of the many names that just made me go "huh?".<hr>Craig Berry said on Sun Jul 11 2004 <br>I have no idea why I am on the list but whatever.<hr>Dan McFall said on Sun Jul 11 2004 <br>Chris Moneymaker?<br />
<br />
You get an invite for stupid plays followed by unbelievable luck on the river?<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Jul 11 2004 <br>They probably got it from decipher or something. David hasn't played a card game since I drug him to his first tournament in 2 yrs at FL states 2 yrs ago.<br />
<br />
Obviously this list has nothing to do with the one i sent them, there is not one heroclix player I nominated. I don't really know who those guys are even.<br />
<br />
Dan Tibbles on the list? Let me be the first to say what a complete loser that guy is.<br />
<br />
Andrew did you sent the same list as me? Because there are no heroclix players and like 20 dragon ball z players.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Jul 11 2004 <br>I did not send any Clix players, as I didn't have their names before the deadline was over (and the list was published). A good number of the LOTR/SW players Decktech nominated got in tho, so thats cool.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a good thing people who really want to play the game and are actual good players will get their own invites, like Dom, since this list seems to be more for people who don't really have much of an intention of playing the game (or are just random idiots like Diniega and Kuder).<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jul 12 2004 <br>Andrew I had the list posted right on the last news post there. Andrew chamberlin, aaron schantz, Joe Green, Nic Karzekski, etc.<br />
<br />
I really want the clixers represented right. I'll try Jeff again directly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your efforts.<hr>George Wilson said on Mon Jul 12 2004 <br>This list seems sorta random for the most part. Wierd about David Akers.<hr>Spencer Ball said on Mon Jul 12 2004 <br>who even are these people. <hr>Jeff Donais said on Tue Jul 13 2004 <br><br />
Hi folks,<br />
<br />
Sorry if some of the players seem unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
I received almost 1000 emails on this subject and spent almost 80 hours researching the suggestions. <br />
<br />
I'm not a complete expert on every game, but I did dedicate a lot of time to doing my homework.<br />
<br />
David Akers is on the list because 3 people suggested him. In your signup screen, it even refers to Akers as "The Founder". I am going to add Neal Razi, however.<br />
<br />
I would have liked to add a couple more Heroclix players, but frankly not very many Heroclix players were nominated and I don't know the players well enough to pick them myself.<br />
<br />
I am willing to make an exception and add a couple more players if they are universally regarded as the best and most-respected Heroclix players.<br />
<br />
My Heroclix experience is basically limited to the Galactus that I have in my office and knowing that the brand manager, Brian Mitchell, is a good guy...<br />
<br />
Fair?<br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />
<br />
Jeff Donais<br />
Upper Deck Entertainment<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Jul 13 2004 <br>Good stuff to hear Jeff, and thanks again for keeping an eye on things here at Decktech. :)<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jul 13 2004 <br>Thanks Jeff - I got your email too, I'll write you right now.<br />
<br />
You really are doing a great job, you can see it in your efforts here. You are doing a really good thing with this.<hr>Adam Drake said on Tue Jul 13 2004 <br>How about a courtesy invite for the Head of the DPC? I mean Decktech's Players Challenge covers a number of games, making it the #1 multi-game ongoing tournament series. Marvel will be a huge addition to the lineup starting this Fall, and I (personally) love the game and really want to make it a huge part of Decktech and the DPC event in the future. Where is the love for ol' Head of Organized Play here at Decktech? <br />
<br />
By the way, I love how UDE (and Jeff Donais) are handling the invite list. This is a much better way to seed the interest in the first Premier Series events.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jul 13 2004 <br>Drake you do an awesome job. You certainly deserve one for the volunteers category as well as being an outstanding player.<br />
<br />
Plus you are just so handsome.<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Jul 15 2004 <br>Now someone needs to tell Jeff Donais that...<hr>Brian Hunter said on Mon Jul 19 2004 <br>Where does one write to this Jeff Donais, anyway?<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Jul 20 2004 <br>Jeff's email is jeff_donais@yahoo.com. You were included on the list I sent in on behalf of Decktech Hunter.<br />
<br />
Also it should be noted the deadline has passed.
