<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>DPC Exec Resigns Amidst Financial Controversy posted by DeckTech on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>DPC VP of Event Organization, Mr. Lingrell, resigned today.<br>
<br>
In an email to David Akers, the CEO of DeckTech Inc, Mr. Lingrell detailed how RamapoCon managed to lose over $1,300 of  DPC funds. The loss came primarily from the last minute charges by the venue. Two days before the event was scheduled to take place the DPC was forced to choose to either cancel the event or lose the money. Deciding in the best interest of the players the DPC proceeded as scheduled. <br>
<br>
When asked how this financial disaster will affect the rest of the DPC, David Akers responded. <br>
<br>
“This one mistake pretty much wipes out all the money we managed to save for the Final Challenge, the big tournament we wanted to hold at the end of the year. I don’t see how we can hold it now. What effect this will have on the rest of the DPC, I’m not sure, we will most likely see some changes in the way DPCs are funded in the future.”<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Fri Aug 10 2001 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Mike said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>It might be very interesting to see what Scott has to say for himself. This is very unnerving to have a prominent member of the swccg community hit with these alegations. I hope it works out for all involved. Another black eye on star wars and gaming in general. <hr>Chris Hunter said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>Well, quite the interesting story gentleman.  Not something I expected to see at all.  I'm sorry to hear that Scott made a mistake but it sounds like an honest one.  I understand that it still is a problem though, never-the-less, but it still bad that it has eliminated the year end event.  I hope things work out for you guys in the future.<hr>Jason said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>A soulution will present itself with in that amount of time. Or at least I hope so. It just looks like one big mess up to me.<hr>lord kenobi said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>as Decktech lost $1,300 they could have each Decktech member donate $1 to help them recover from that event.Doing That would get them the $1,300 back that they lost at the DPC. I'm sure the Decktech members would be more than happy to donate $1, as Decktech does all this stuff for us, and makes less than $100 off of an event and what do we do for them? (besides using the website and going to their DPC's)<hr>MattJ said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>A very unfortunate experience. I hope that as the investigation goes on that it is proved to be an oversight and not an intentional event. <hr>Instigator said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>What if Decipher paid Lingrell to ruin the DPCs? WOOOOOOOOOOAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH <hr>Instigator Killa said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>Shut up dude, this is serious<hr>Bane Slader said on Thu Aug 9 2001 <br>I definately would like to see the Final Event take place.  Please keep all of up on what really happened.  I second the idea for each member sending $1 to keep the event going.  People had a great time at the first one.  Scott does not hit me as a person who would do this on purpose ... there's gotta be an exceptional reason for the mix up.<br>

It is unfortunate that something like this had to happen to a guy as nice as Lingrell, because he is truly one of the "good guys" in the game.<hr>david.irvine said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>I am totally fine with the $1 from each member idea. Decktech has done more for Star Wars than anybody could have hoped. $1 from each member won't mean that much to each person, but to the organization that has brought us a fantastic web site and a series of tournaments to keep the game alive, one dollar from each person will make a difference. Just tell me where to send.<hr>Matt McGann said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>He put the players before anything esle. Somthing decipher never does. He made a mistake and admitted it. Hey, in my eyes he did nothing wrong at all. sorry but $1,300 isn't a whole lot of money. Every one on the site has probably spent more than that on their SW collection. <hr>the Lorax said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>anyone looking to throw money into the pot can go to "Tech Shop" under the dropdown menu on the top right side of the screen.  Buy your entry into the raffle - its $2, and its setup to use PayPal.  I encourage everyone to do this to help out this site.<hr>Matt 'Phobos' Berta said on Fri Aug 10 2001 <br>I personally witnessed Scott work his ass off at that Con. I've never seen anyone so dedicated to gaming as Scott is. He saved my butt by picking me up from the airport when I flew in, about 30 miles from the College. He didn't have to do that, and I thanked him repeatedly for that. (And Mike Dalton for use of the vehicle). I had a great time at RamapoCon and will attend next year if Scott is involved in any way. I will help him out in any way he sees fit, and if it's donating to Decktech, a site that has improved my game by about a thousand percent, then that's a small favor to do for a great friend.<hr>Garion said on Sun Aug 12 2001 <br>Sorry guys, but donating 1$ is not a good idea, there ar other ways (go to Tech Shop if you want to help)<br>
The new DPC tournament looks like a cool idea.
