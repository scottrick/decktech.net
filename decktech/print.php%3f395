Heh, I was *almost* thinking Andrew wasn't going to win something there for a second! But he nailed the last prize on my little qbasic random number generator to pull in a prize.<br />
<br />
Now the question you are all wondering is how do you claim your prizes?<br />
<br />
Very easy, although it'll take me some co-ordinating to get out.  Please email me <a href="mailto:neal@decktech.net">neal@decktech.net</a> to start. I'll go from there.<br />
<br />
All we ask is that you pay shipping on these of course, I hope that is ok.<br />
<br />
Merry Chistmas all and thanks for being part of an incredible year! Get those <a href="http://www.decktech.net/premium/">premium memberships</a> up, and we'll be doing this again next year, and even earlier depending on how many people sign up!<br />
<br />

<br />
What did you all think of the prizes?<hr>Chris Wodicka said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>amazing. thanks.<br />
<br />
merry christmas.<hr>Lee Edwards said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>Awesome prizes.  Thanks to all of Decktech's sponsors for kicking ass and putting together an awesome package for the best swccg site on the net.<hr>Patrick Sullivan said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>charging us for shipping? lol, that is so Decipher-like of you, Neal :)<hr>Lee Edwards said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>As I recall, Decipher's holiday giveaways involved scrambling around their site for clues and only had 1 winner of some crappy box of something no one buys.  They were fun to do, but rather disappointing when you find out you are one of a thousand guys to qualify for the drawing.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>Its been fun. <hr>brad eier said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>woot this is totally cool neal, dt is great!!<hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Dec 25 2003 <br>Thanks, Neal and everyone.  I never had an uncut sheet before.  That will be so cool.  <hr>Justin Desai said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>ccn is not clint hays!<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>oops scracth Kevin Elia off the rook list. I screwed up and typed it twice, there should be 5 of 2 capsules, 5 of one capsule. He's got the Card Vault program<hr>Kevin Elia said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>I didn't think I deserved 2 prizes! But thanks for the one! It's awesome to get something back, even though the content makes the site worth paying for to start with!<hr>Ryan Patterson said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>I thought I kissed enough hiney to get a prize, but then Kevin Elia must of kissed Neals behind the most to get 2 prizes. ;-) <br />
<br />
I was hoping to get something. Oh well, maybe next time. <hr>Robby Boey said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>Congrats to all the winners!  Next year I'll try to bribe Neal... guys, what does he like and never refuses? ;-)<br />
Merry Christmas everyone!!<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>Ahh, guys, see that's the thing.  I knew I'd feel bad no matter who didn't win.  Like over half of the premium are real friends.  Ryan, Matt, Robby, Lee, a whole bunch of my good friends didn't win anything.<br />
<br />
But I had to be fair - I had to go with the random number generator. It was the only way to go.<br />
<br />
I think I may do something else in the meantime, to get it to 100 (and over). I think i'll do something like anyone who signs up or renews gets something.<br />
<br />
or maybe a monthly drawing for every signee for the month? Something like that.<br />
<br />
Sorry, really to all who didn't win. Really.<hr>Michael Hawley said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>Neal, we pay for the service, not the prizes.  I appreciate this site and everything you do for us.  I get my money's worth without any prizes.  Don't appologize.  You didn't have to do anything.  <hr>Lee Edwards said on Fri Dec 26 2003 <br>What does Neal like that he never refuses?  Bribe him with a plastic kids toy.<hr>Coonskin Cap Numb said on Sat Dec 27 2003 <br>If you aint know what who ccn is/what, you can find out on my decktech page.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Sat Dec 27 2003 <br>Thanks Neal! And thanks to all of the sponsors!<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Dec 27 2003 <br>Mike Blumberg was the only one i rigged, because he buys me dinner ;-)<br />
<br />
j/k, haha.<hr>Robby Boey said on Sun Dec 28 2003 <br>No apologies necessary Neal.  I too get all I need out of DT!!  To all a happy New Year!!<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Dec 29 2003 <br>thanks surge, I really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
A couple people haven't responded yet, if you know someone on the list, let 'em know.<hr>Lee Edwards said on Mon Dec 29 2003 <br>If they don't collect their prize you can hold a Kwanza lottery and give it to someone else.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Dec 29 2003 <br>hmmm, haha, i might have to do that!<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Tue Dec 30 2003 <br>Or you can have a Festivus "feats of strength" competition for the unclaimed prizes :)<hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Jan 1 2004 <br>Neal, did you get my note?
