The event was a blast, and everyone walked away happy.  First game everyone got an OTSD, a pack of Special Edition, and EPP Obi.  Second game everyone got a Special Edition Starter, a pack of Special Edition, and EPP Luke.  Third game everyone got a DSII Starter, a pack of Special Edition, and EPP Vader.  Fourth game, everyone got an EJP starter, a couple of packs of special edition (I think it rounded out at 4), and EPP Fett.<BR><BR>It is a great format and for those going to DCon, I would especially find out if one these things is running because they are a blast.  Ask anyone walking by who saw Admiral Piett piloting Red 7 or saw Obi fighting against the rebels...it was a great time...<BR><BR>Pete Flamini won the event, and for his efforts got close to a full set of dark side reflections III foils.<BR><BR>The event raised $120 for the UMDF.<BR><BR><br>

Details are sort of above.  Your favorite webmaster - Neal Razi - went into the finals undefeated against Brian Fred, also undefeated.  Didn't hear the details of how it ended, I just know from what I read above, it sounds like Neal came up minionless, or close to it.  Brian Fred winds up the winner there.<hr>Michael Carr said on Sat Oct 12 2002 <br>Lord of the Rings InstaTournament in.  Greg Shaw walks away the winner!<BR><BR>Last results for tonight.  Running a tournament tomorrow - Raw Deal, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings!  Need to prepare.<hr>Michael Carr said on Tue Oct 15 2002 <br>Well, three of the top 4 rings decks are in on Dectech.net.  Check them out.  I plan on starting to put in the Rings Master event tonight, but I expect I won't get much further then adding everyone to the tournament.<hr>Michael Carr said on Thu Oct 17 2002 <br>Well, the Rings Master series event is in.  During the normal 8 games, Greg Shaw took first after SoS kicked in.  However in the finals, Shawn Drew (Greg's only loss during the normal 8 games) knocked him out of the top place contention.  Michael Dalton, the second place for the day beat Jesse Carlucci to win his way to the final 2.  In best out of three between Michael Dalton and Shawn Drew, Shawn won game 1, then Dalton swept the last two to walk away the winner of the Lord of the Rings Master Series event.<hr>Michael Carr said on Sat Oct 19 2002 <br>Hmmm...last bit of FCon II admin work done...results from all tournaments into Decipher...Wars Master Series - Brian Hunter wins a nail biter by a total of 4 differential against Justin Desai in the final two games to walk away not only FCon II champ but also Decktech's Player of the Year...last results will be permanent as of Sunday night at 12:00...Congrats to Brian...See most of you at DCon...
