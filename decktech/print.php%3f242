<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Paul Twomey said on Fri Sep 20 2002 <br>This sucks... apparently there is 12 Elf Companions in TTT ... The Elven culture was already dominant in Fellowship and now it will dominate TTT ... I want more Dwarf, Hobbit, Gandalf !!!!<hr>George Wilson said on Fri Sep 20 2002 <br><b>Lembas is gonna be a big hit, but I think that it should be a healing possession. Reconcile your hand? WTF???<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Sep 20 2002 <br>cool i like the elven sword a lot.  The game has way to many very specific cards right now, a little versatility makes the game more fun.<br>
<br>
The weird thing is that's almost exactly what i recommended to some people, i wonder if someone finally listened to me.  Except mine was "skirmish: exert the bearer to make him damage +1"<hr>Derek Kitzman said on Fri Sep 20 2002 <br>Here's two more for you.<br>

"'Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago.'"<hr>Kyle Szklenski said on Sat Sep 21 2002 <br>George Wilson: Think about it. Did Lembas ever actually heal anyone? No. Yes, it gave them energy back. Hmm, energy in this game is kinda represented by having cards in your hand I think. You can get more pumpers for your guys and what not. I like it a lot.<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Sat Sep 21 2002 <br>hmm...interesting way of getting another double move out with that elf posession, but 3 elfs?! holy crap. <br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Casey Barson said on Sat Sep 21 2002 <br>3 Elves is nothing.  Start with Legolas and Arwen then all you need to do is play Elrond, Galadriel, anyone of 7 other elf allies that might help your deck.  Seems pretty easy to get it out, but thats just me I guess.<hr>Eric Splittgerber said on Sat Sep 21 2002 <br>Why the hell are all these elves coming out NOW? they should have put them down in the Fellowship, this is just crazy... there were almost no elves in the book and now theres going to be wars with them. the closest the book ever got to this was in return of the king, when Galadriel took Dol-Guldur. now what was it that Elrond said? "the time of elves is over, my people are leaving these shores" doesnt sound like that to me. they should have left out Haldirs little band of elves at The Hornburg...<hr>David Evans said on Sun Sep 22 2002 <br>RFD Spoilers :<br>

<hr>Nathan Russell said on Sun Sep 22 2002 <br>I am still drooling over that Vanguard. He may be a bit limited in his use, but if he comes out, you'd better watch out!<hr>Alex Weavers said on Mon Sep 23 2002 <br>Damn that manguard is excessive.  I'm seeing alot of cards in this set designed to counter the Run-and-Gun Rangers Superfellowship mob happening right about now.  The war club will wreck any superfellowship deck, as will a Balrog that moves with you (The Manguard).  This should be a rockin' set.<br>
<br>
I can't wait to see what they do for the Three Hunters decks that are popping up now.<hr>Derek Kitzman said on Tue Sep 24 2002 <br>Here are some Hobbit cards<br>

Event<br>
<br>
Stealth.<br>
Skirmish: Discard an unbound Hobbit.<br>

I'm sure your saying "Why not just use the site 5 hobbit stealth?" Maybe this will tell you why.<br>

There will be some more things to do with "Unbound Hobbits" latter to come.<hr>Derek Kitzman said on Wed Sep 25 2002 <br>Here are some more cool new TTT cards!<br>
<br>
<br>
Merry, Unquenchable Hobbit<br>
1 Twilight Cost<br>
Shire Culture<br>
Companion, Hobbit<br>

Vitality = 4<br>
Gandalf Signet<br>
<br>
Skirmish: If Merry is not assigned to a skirmish, discard him to remove a(Sauron) Orc from a skirmish involving an unbound companion.<br>
<br>
"'All Wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care - to teach them the<br>
meaning of the word, and to correct them.'"<br>
<br>
And now it's the card we (well me anyway) have been waiting for! And is it as good as I wanted it to be? Not at all. But heres the card.<br>
<br>
Treebeard, Earthborn<br>
4 Twilight Cost<br>
Gandalf Culture<br>
Ally, Home 2(t) & 8(t), Ent (this is how it was when I looked at what this card does. I'm not sure if it means he has two homes or what.<br>
Strength = 12<br>
Vitality = 4<br>
<br>
Unhasty.<br>
Response: If an unbound Hobbit is about to be disarded, stack him here<br>
instead.<br>
Fellowship: Exert Treebeard and add (1) to play an unbound Hobbit stacked here.<br>
<br>
"'Do not be hasty, that is my motto.'"<br>
<br>
12 power is cool. I hope there is a treebeard that has more to do with fighting. We will just have to wait and see.<hr>Derek Kitzman said on Thu Sep 26 2002 <br>More cards! Yum Yum...<br>
<br>
Forests of Ithilien<br>
0 Twilight Cost<br>
Gondor Culture<br>
Condition<br>
<br>
Plays to your support area. While the fellowship is at site 5(t), the site number of each Man in a skirmish is +2. Regroup: Discard this condition and exert a Ring-bound Man to liberate a site.<br>
<br>
"...a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams."<br>
<br>
I site with a (t) after it means it only works with the Two Towers version of that site number (the same gos for allys)Now for the next card.<br>
<br>
New Errand<br>
1 Twilight Cost<br>
Gondor Culture<br>
Event<br>
<br>
Skirmish: Spot a Ring-bound Man to make a minion's site number +2. If that<br>
minion loses this skirmish, you may wound a minion.<br>
<br>
"'...we come to ambush the Men of Harad.'"<br>
<br>
Looks cool to me. That would be good with Faramir's Bow. The cards just keep pouring out (and theres nothing rong with that) I look forward to the rest of TTT.
