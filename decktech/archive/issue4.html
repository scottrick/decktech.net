        been a while since the last DeckTech. Endor will soon be out and without 
        a reliable way to deliver you the quality SW: CCG information you need, 
        how can DeckTech hope to survive?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It’s not that I have 
        lost interest the problem lies in that as a human being and having a team 
        of human beings editing, compiling and qualifying the submissions becomes 
        long and tiring process. We are the weak link, the contributors do not 
        always send out enough submissions on time to meet the deadline, the editors 
        do not always get back on schedule, as humans we sometimes just don’t 
        feel like it.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We knew something 
        had to change, so we went looking for solutions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we found was 
        a simple statement that revolutionizes the way we thought of DeckTech.</font></p>
      <b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The progress 
        of any organization is directly related to the speed at which the whole 
        can process information&quot;</font></p>
      </b><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We could see this 
        economic principle happening right before our eyes with DeckTech. Our 
        inability to process the information was hindering our success as an organization. 
        We needed a way to turn around and process information globally instantly, 
        in real-time, with no human weakness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We needed a new information 
        exchange model something that combines the best of what is available to 
        us right now. So we created the datashare concept. This is an exciting 
        time for us here at DeckTech. If you’re interested in finding out more 
        about the datashare concept and how it effects us check out the next article.

            --------------------<br>
            <br>
            Simplifying the Schools<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size=2>When you simplify it there are basically 
            2 schools of deck design in SW: CCG. </font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>The Deck of the Month Club and the Pro Players Club</p>
      <p>The DOTMC says pick a few things to do really well, focus, focus, and 
        focus. And like a laser you can penetrate any other deck design. This 
        school of thought often time neglects the opponent altogether and only 
        focuses on accomplishing a specific objective or two. Many times this 
        results in speed decks or lockdown decks. These decks perform fairly well 
        85% of the time but usually fails at the worst possible time. Like in 
        a big tournament. The reason is they are focused to the point were they 
        have real weakness that hopefully you can't exploit because of their strong 
        offensive moves. In big tournaments there is always one player who can 
        see your weakness and exploit it. </p>
      <p>Another negative to the DOTMC is that the life cycle of a typical deck 
        of the month is so short thus the name. This stems from the nature of 
        the lethality of these decks design. According to the paradox of lethality 
        the more devastating the weapon you use against your enemy the faster 
        they counter to defend against it. The ultimate goal of a DOTMC member 
        is to construct a deck that wins every time, without fail regardless of 
        what your opponent is playing. When they achieve even something close 
        to this then Decipher usually steps in and errata's the cards. Most of 
        the time they don't accomplish that but manage to generate fairly lethal 
        decks, which of course get countered. </p>
      <p>The skill in being a member of the DOTMC is in building the deck. I know 
        lot's of players who are DOTMC players and they are good players no doubt 
        but they really shine when building their decks. The quick turnaround 
        necessitates that they become better and better and faster and faster. 
        Many can look at a deck list and play the first turns in their mind and 
        tell you all the problems that your going to face and which decks will 
        beat you and which you will win against. They are excellent meta-gamers 
        they themselves control the meta-game. Like the force they bend it to 
        their will. They are too cards focused and not game focused though. Because 
        they play with different decks all the time they never really get a firm 
        grip on any one deck. The elusive strategies that would have reveal themselves 
        had they continued with a deck often times vanish when the new decks are 
        made.</p>
      <p>Because of this they usually have problems with the next group of players, 
        the Pro Players Club.</p>
      <p>The Pro Players Club is opposed to changing their decks very much at 
        all. Sometimes they spend an hour trying to change out a single card only 
        to change it back just before a tournament. Why? The PPC is not about 
        the decks it's about the game. The deck is built to allow the player to 
        control, combat, and dismantle the other player. The PPC motto is not 
        "build a deck that will win", but rather "build a deck that will give 
        me a chance to win". They play well-balanced decks. They play decks that 
        give you a chance to win against everything. And then they practice, practice, 
        and practice with those decks until they know them better that they know 
        themselves. </p>
      <p>They know that Figrin Dan is a good force retrieval card just like the 
        DOTMC players do. But they also know that he is a good way to set up destinies, 
        and look at your opponents deck, and a way to hold off AAA for a turn, 
        and a way to block a drain late in the game and a way to throw your opponents 
        destiny tracking off … and on and on. It's not the deck, it’s their playing 
        that makes a difference. Many have an entire set of rules they personally 
        follow that they have constructed from experience. What to do against 
        this, what to do against that etc. It should come as a surprise to no 
        one that when they go to build or rebuild after an expansion that they 
        try do design a deck that gives them a chance to counter all of the following. 
      </p>
      <p>Opponents Offensive Objectives:</p>
      <p>Force Drain - cause you to discard by controlling drainable locations</p>
      <p>Battle Damage - cause you to discard by causing him battle damage</p>
      <p>Energy Choke - prevent the you from doing anything by denying him necessary 
        force</p>
      <p>Effect Damage - playing an effect that causes the you to discard</p>
      <p>Interrupt Damage - playing an interrupt that causes the you to discard</p>
      <p>Manipulation - using several methods to prevent you from using your cards 
        or increasing his card use</p>
      <p>Intelligence Gathering - using several methods to discover what you are 
        playing</p>
      <p>Psychological Assault - using several methods to cause you mental and 
        emotional disruption</p>
      <p>Block Regeneration - prevent you from regenerating any life force</p>
      <p>Place out of Play - putting your critical components out of play</p>
      <p>Opponents Defensive Objectives:</p>
      <p>Block Force Drains - prevent you from force draining them </p>
      <p>Block Battle Damage - preventing you from causing them battle damage</p>
      <p>Prevent Energy Choke - preventing you from getting a force choke hold 
        on them</p>
      <p>Cancel Effect Damage - preventing or canceling any damage caused by effects</p>
      <p>Cancel Interrupt Damage - preventing or canceling any damage caused by 
        interrupts</p>
      <p>Prevent Manipulation - preventing you from manipulating either of your 
        cards</p>
      <p>Counter Intelligence - preventing you from discovering their cards</p>
      <p>Counter Psychological Warfare - preventing you from disrupting them mentally</p>
      <p>The Pro Players will make decks that can counter all of these objectives. 
        Thus after having done that are not inclined to change their deck much 
        at least until the next expansion. The problem with the PPC is that often 
        times refusing to change often leads to stagnation and antiquation. They 
        become relics and often times get swept away by DOTMC because they refused 
        to admit they old-style decks are not good enough anymore. Still if you 
        are considering becoming a truly great SW: CCG player you will need to 
        master the balanced deck. Just keep yourself updated and current. And 
        play a lot.</p>
      <p>Of the two types which would you say you more comfortable with? You will 
        probably take the road most of us do. Start as a DOTMC and move into the 
        PPC and then visit the DOTMC every once and a while just to make the game 
        interesting. What ever you do, do it well and you will succeed.</p>

      <p>Players Guide:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> As you see, this deck is a customized version of HDADTJ, but there are 
        some few important changes that give this deck much more freedom. <br>
        <br>
        1st point: no The Circle Is Now Complete, so you have 2 cards slots free, 
        and less "must have" cards in hand. <br>
        <br>
        2nd point: no destiny adders or duel adders, so here again you have other 
        slots free. <br>
        <br>
        3rd point: it has a quick setup, with 8 battleground sites and 6 Vader. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Strong points: <br>
        1st point: 2 Trample, 2 SE Vader</p>
      <p>2nd point: 5 destiny 7 (but only 4 in your life force) that you can recirculate 
        with Reactor Terminal</p>
      <p>3rd point: Trample will work against Ewoks, so you are in good position 
        to face Endor.</p>
      <p>4th point: Come Here You Big Coward just in case (starting effect if 
        you face No-Shelter with Revolutions)</p>
      <p>5th point: no Visage defense (it would require too many cards to do it 
        effectively) but just another Visage ready for service.</p>
      <p>The main tactic is to put Vader down early at a battleground site (1st 
        or 2nd turn) to flip the objective as soon as possible. Then, if there 
        is no opposition, this deck basically spreads out with Walkers to drain 
        for the kill. When Obi shows up, you just have to Choke him via a destiny 
        7 (or Trample him) and crush the remaining opposition. This deck usually 
        arranges 2 destiny 7</p>
      <p>in a row to duel succesfully Luke (no need of destiny adders, then). 
        This pretty much reduce the fear of EPP strikes. Especially since they 
        won't be able to Sense/Alter anything. </p>
      <p> Situations:</p>
      <p> 1) operatives: usually (if they are not starting with Goo Nee Tay) you 
        can deploy Vader first turn, which usually means you've won. This deck 
        choke and Trample everyone, and with also J'Quille, operatives tend to 
        be slaughtered.</p>
      <p> 2) HB: well, the quick setup allows this deck to deal a substantial 
        amount of damage in the beginning, meanwhile you just Alter their effect 
        and lose your Death Squadron Star Destroyers (to be retrieved later via 
        Put All Sections On Alert to probe when you are ready). Usually you manage 
        to find it. Also spreading to drain at 3 different sites means that your 
        opponent will always suffer damage each turn.</p>
      <p> 3) EPP Swarm: this (im my opinion) has always been the nemesis of HDADTJ, 
        since LS is way too powerful with the EPPs. Indeed, LS is faster, but 
        against this deck, thanks to the objective, tends to lose. The reason 
        is one simple one: when you did just Trample or Choke Obi-Wan Kenobi, 
        there isn't much your opponent can do anymore to damage you. Obviously, 
        no-one told you that you couldn't Choke and/or Trample someone else.:)</p>
      <p>Let's start a review card by card:</p>
      <p>Locations:</p>
      <p>Tatooine JP and JP Audience Chamber: both are immune to Revolution, have 
        good game text, and generate 2 Force. The Audience Chamber can be used 
        to hide from a speeders deck too.</p>
      <p>Jundland Wastes, Lars' Moisture Farm, Tusken Canyon: drain +1 here. Mos 
        Eisley: cancel LS Mos Eisley, average game text and good Force generation 
        Cantina: drain of 2 there plus protection from speeders, good game text. 
        Krayt Dragon Pass: the best site to defend (since all your locations are 
        Tatooine sites) but doesn't give a drain of 2 there. SE Vader+LS rules 
        here.</p>
      <p>Characters:</p>
      <p>SE Vader: he's the best, just don't forget to add his lightsaber. </p>
      <p>EPP Vader: put him down until you find the SE one with his Lightsaber. 
      </p>
      <p>Tarkin: besides his obvious abilities, he can ve protected in a Walker. 
        Then, he is also an ability 3 pilot, which means you can make him pilot 
        any AT-AT or ISD and draw a battle destiny.</p>
      <p>Admiral Ozzel: perfect pilot for Blizzard 2 and for the Executor (then 
        your Death squadron Star Destroyer are deploy -3 there), he's also free 
        with a good forfeit. Just be careful of his game text.</p>
      <p>Admiral Motti: high forfeit, good power-ability and also ability 3 pilot. 
      </p>
      <p>Zuckuss: react for free and makes Chewbacca forfeit 0 (or any other alien 
        with ability &amp;lt;3). He's a pilot too.</p>
      <p>EPP Boba: good in ground battles and also an ability 3 pilot. J'Quille: 
        a spy, with a great game text, and high power ; he is only ability 1, 
        but then all your other characters are ability 3, so no problem.</p>
      <p>Kitik Keed'kak: the perfect counterpart of Niago Duegad. together they 
        pack immense power (8 each) and can draw battle destiny. Perfect to kill 
        people indoors or to make your opponent spy sorry to have entered in the 
        executor. Boba Fett is nice with them also.</p>
      <p>Niago Duegad: see Kitik Keed'kak.</p>
      <p>Vehicles:</p>
      <p>Not much to say here, except all have permanent pilots and that Blizzard 
        Scout 1 is a must have thanks to its 'react' capability.</p>
      <p>Starships:</p>
      <p>Executor: once, I was about to change it for another ISD, because he 
        has the drawback of killing Visage should you forfeit it (since the Executor 
        sites will head straight fro the Lost Pile), but then, it has also some 
        advantages: your other ISD are deply -2 there, it has an incredible punch 
        (use Lateral Damage), and you can put it alone at a system shoud your 
        opponent sneak into the</p>
      <p>Executor sites and you don't have the ressources to throw them out (your 
        opponent won't try to destroy your starship if his characters are aboard). 
        You could even make a loosing battle to forfeit it to kill all your opponent's 
        characters aboard.</p>
      <p>Death Squadron Star Destroyer: these can be retrieved via Put All Sections 
        On Alert and are a good addition to the Executor in space (+ they are 
        immune to attrition &lt;4).</p>
      <p>Weapons:</p>
      <p>Vader's Lightsabers and destiny 7.</p>
      <p>Interrupts:</p>
      <p>Not much to say. Masterful Move can be played also to get a Visage (just 
        to warn your opponent that cancelling your starting one will be useless 
        and/or to recirculate it into your used pile, since it is a destiny 7). 
      </p>
      <p>Hunting Party is another destiny 7, but Mournful Roar would also do the 
        job. And you have another Twi'lek Advisor (usually used to get your Reactor 
        Terminal)</p>
      <p>Effects</p>
      <p>Bad Feeling I Have IS a GOOD starting effect, you have to slow EPPs and 
        Mains to better kill them all. Remember also that Goo Nee Tay doesn't 
        affect Walkers. </p>
      <p>Visage Of The Emperor: 1 for start, the other for back-up (if the first 
        one is cancelled) or for destiny.</p>
      <p>Come Here You Big Coward: nice against EBO, against spies in the Executor, 
        or</p>
      <p>against No Shelter/Revolutions decks. It is also a must have against 
        MWHYL decks (even if Secret Plans is better).</p>
      <p>Reactor Terminal: you have to recirculate your cards, right ?</p>
      <p>Lateral Damage: can be a game ender, and I like this card, so I keep 
        one copy of it. Indeed, it works everytime.</p>
      <p>There'll Be Hell To Pay: against degenerate tactics.</p>
      <p>Epic Duel: you need it, you have it.</p>
      <p>Conclusion:</p>
      <p>LS Mains tend to get caught unaware the first time you strike, and then 
        fear your destinies 7, so you pretty much accomplished what you want: 
        "Anger, Fear, Aggression, the Dark Side they are."</p>
      <p>No more fear from LS Mains and EPPS, now the Dark Side is back ! "You 
        don't know the power of the Dark Side." But the DS player do ! Since he'll 
        know which destiny he'll have in his deck....</p>

      <p>Ok this is a basic Dark Side balanced deck for this enviroment. Here 
        how it plays.</p>
      <p>Start with Death Star and your choice of effect. </p>
      <p>Against HBX alter Yarna/Sfoils monnok the xwings and take control of 
        a few key systems. Then drain on the ground in walkers or cantina.</p>
      <p>Against No Shelter: Start D* and CHYBC and wait them out until you get 
        a sizable strike force, be careful not to deploy locations you can’t control. 
        Mostly just get the systems out and drain with the characters for forfeit 
        fodder. </p>
      <p>Against any ops Start with either OE or resistance and get some systems 
        out for force and twilik for ABC as soon as you can control the D*. You 
        should be able to maintain control and drain for 3 or so while draining 
        from space for 3 and ground for 1. Use Dark Waters to cut their drains 
        down and move a loaded Walker onto the remaining location. Monnok, Monnok, 
        Monnok.</p>
      <p>Against Maelstrom start OE and twilik for a grabber. Same with the Dark 
        Waters go for ABC and try to kill of the merchants</p>
      <p>Against a Destiny 7 MWYHL. Start CHYBC and go for Blizzard Walker with 
        Tarkin/Vader at Downtown plaza, Executor/Ozzel at Kiffex. Monnoks on the 
        Holotable for 5 drains a turn catch OTE with WAYTTPOU. Alter Traffic Control 
        and monnok. Use characters for forfiet fodder from high destiny epp strikes.</p>
      <p>Against anything else use your judgement. This isn’t a great deck in 
        the hands of a person who expects it to play itself. </p>

      <p>Jabba's Palace Hit Squad</p>
      </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>First, a little background is in order. This deck is basically a response 
        to the rampant LS M&amp;T madness. However, unlike other responses to 
        this LS trend (ie: speed CPI, DS Dank, or old school Big Blue), this deck 
        is built to confront LS Mains on their own turf and hopefully beat</p>
      <p>them at their own game. Without any further ado, here's my attempt to 
        fight fire with fire--the Jabba's Palace Hit Squad.</p>
      <p>Locations:6</p>
      <p>Jabba's Palace (starting location)</p>
      <p>JP:Entrance Cavern</p>
      <p>JP:Audience Chamber</p>
      <p>JP:Dungeon</p>
      <p>JP:Droid Workshop</p>
      <p>JP:Rancor Pit</p>
      <p>Characters:17</p>
      <p>3 EPP Vader</p>
      <p>2 Grand Moff Tarkin</p>
      <p>1 Jabba the Hutt</p>
      <p>2 Jabba</p>
      <p>2 Boelo</p>
      <p>2 EPP Boba Fett</p>
      <p>2 Dr. Evazan</p>
      <p>2 Outer Rim Scout</p>
      <p>1 Miyoom </p>
      <p>Starships: 6</p>
      <p>Jabba's Space Cruiser</p>
      <p>2 Bossk in Hound's Tooth</p>
      <p>2 Executor</p>
      <p>1 Vader's Personal Shuttle</p>
      <p>Effects: 10</p>
      <p>Disarmed</p>
      <p>First Strike </p>
      <p>Bad Feeling Have I (starting vs. M&amp;T)</p>
      <p>Reactor Terminal</p>
      <p>2 Expand the Empire (starting vs. HB; in multiple b/c you need to find 
        it quickly)</p>
      <p>2 Presence of the Force</p>
      <p>There'll be Hell to Pay</p>
      <p>Come Here You Big Coward</p>
      <p>Interrupts: 21</p>
      <p>4 Alter</p>
      <p>4 Sense</p>
      <p>3 Twi'lek Advisor</p>
      <p>3 Elis Helrot</p>
      <p>3 Sniper</p>
      <p>2 Monnok</p>
      <p>2 You Are Beaten</p>
      <p>Strategy Notes:</p>
      <p> Again, I constructed this deck as *fun* answer to LS M&amp;T. As such, 
        this is a *battle* oriented JP deck, no Gailid, and not for the faint 
        of heart. Against LS M&amp;T, start with Bad Feeling Have I to give you 
        a little more time to get your aliens out. First, look for ETE so you 
        can put it on the Audience Chamber (nothing new). This, coupled with JP's 
        text, will let you find whatever aliens you need to complete your hit 
        squad (Jabba, Boelo, Fett, Evazan). If they send someone to block JP's 
        text (it's usually too early for them to send anybody exceedingly strong), 
        send what you have to confront them, use JP+Chamber text to grab someone 
        else, and move where it suits you best; repeat the process as needed if 
        you can't seem to get them off of JP. After you got your hit squad assembled, 
        get out Miyoom (note: cancel Goo Nee Tay ASAP). She mainly serves as a 
        diversion; first she forces the LS to diligently monitor their hand, second 
        she kills naughty rebels (duh). If your local meta packs heavy counters 
        to her, Dannik Jeriko is a great replacement;</p>
      <p>his out of play text is very useful against LS Mains. It's usually best 
        to save the Vader/Tarkin combo until they've made some kind of commitment 
        to the ground or space (of course, the exception to this is if you need 
        VAder to SA stuff); this way they aren't stuck where they're not</p>
      <p>needed. </p>
      <p> The deck has very concentrated fighting force that doesn't work very 
        well in pieces, so you have to make sure to optimize the battles you fight 
        as they represent the deck's major means of hurting the opponent. When 
        you're ready to battle, check their hand with Monnok (look for Quite a 
        Merc, Hioujx, good battle cards, etc), make an effective (this means setting 
        up destiny to Sense It's a Hit) transport w/Elis, and administer *effective* 
        beatdown (drop First Strike for Hioujx, Sense any nasty interrupts, and 
        use your character removal). Hopefully, it should only take a couple of 
        *effective* battles to seal the game. If they move into space, the Bus, 
        Executor, Vader's Shuttle, and the ORSs can give them a headache, especially 
        if you saved your Vader/Tarkin combo. </p>
      <p>Against HB, start with Expand the Empire to up your activation, so you 
        can start looking for your ships. Again, your object is to beat them at 
        their own game. Sense, Alter, Monnok, and There'll Be Hell To Pay effectively 
        shut down their pesky effects and interrupts. From there, you need savvy 
        battling. A loaded Space Cruiser (Jabba, Boelo, Fett, and an ORS) is deadly, 
        giving you total immunity, free movement, two destiny, and one canceled 
        destiny. If they deploy Tatoonie, simply cancel ETE on the Palace, redeploy 
        to the Audience Chamber, and look for the guys you</p>
      <p>Need to load up the Cruiser. The Executor, Vader/Tarkin, The Bus, and 
        Personal Shuttle speak for themselves. Also, Miyoom can stow aboard a 
        ship and offer status reports on their hand. </p>
      <p>Once you establish control over their interrupts and effects, you shouldn't 
        have much trouble</p>
      <p>battling and draining them till they die. Force Drain? What's that? Battle, 
        baby, Battle! Oh yeah, most importantly, Have Fun.</p>

      <p>Players Guide:<br>
        This No Shelter deck is an attempt to lean towards more conventional deck 
        numbers of non-red cards . It is a painstaking process for me ;) </p>
      <p>The one thing most people cringe at is the small number of sites but 
        you'll find that once you get one site that activates 2 more force for 
        you out, then you'll have all the force you'll usually need and start 
        getting all the sites. I also don't like many locations because I can 
        get mad drawing a 0 for a crucial destiny ( in playtesting for Worlds 
        -- I playtested about 7 games with my first sketch of a Dark Side HDADTJ 
        deck and drew a 0 for Hidden Weapons 15 times in a row during the course 
        of those games , I felt sick on number 15, so that helped me to decide 
        to play a Space Deck ;) . </p>
      <p>Come Back Here You Big Coward shouldn't be too much of a problem. I use 
        the Revolutions mainly for battling and the only time I've ever Revolved 
        the hut in a game is versus TIE decks and other space ( mostly non-interactive 
        ) decks. If they have a Battleground location , chances are you will be 
        able to knock them off that location pretty quickly and then won't have 
        to worry about the requirement. Goo Nee Tay helps keep that quick edge 
        and chance for the nostalgia of the quick Cantina Shuffle. Basically there 
        is no place for the opponent to hide. Revolution will gain access to any 
        non-battleground location , except the Death Star and Tantive IV will 
        gain you access to that. So in a sense they will have No Shelter from 
        your attacks , hence the name </p>
      <p>and cool song. </p>
      <p>Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi is another concern. If Dueling HDADTJ 
        is prominent in your area you will want to throw in Glancing Blow ( making 
        Vader's power = 0 in any other game can be devastating with this deck 
        in its own right ) maybe Armed and Dangerous or another Courage of a Skywalker. 
        Non-dueling HDADTJ shouldn't be much of a problem. Revolution / Goo Nee 
        Tay will also put a dent into HDADTJ. Ralltiir Ops and Bad Feeling Have 
        I will usually only delay the initial beatdown for a turn ( Revolution 
        and/or Tantive IV are sooo mean towards RO anyways ). </p>
      <p>Against ISB 20/20 it will be a good match ; the Shocking Infos hopefully 
        will make them pay</p>
      <p>for Scanning Crews and those EPPs with weapons can mow through characters 
        quickly </p>
      <p>with a Savrip at its back , one good Frozen Assets with multiple battle 
        destinies and the game is in your favor. I'd have to say that No Shelter 
        works because with the release of Special Edition people expect to play 
        solataire and not have something interfere with their deck. They aren't</p>
      <p>use to seeing someone devote their whole deck towards directly attacking 
        them. </p>
      <p>They expect to see someone start with an Objective with which they can 
        classify the deck right off the bat ( I've only seen very few creative 
        ideas off objectives). Also the force choke aspect is very nasty , you 
        make them save force ( slight choke ) for an interrupt that in all likelyhood 
        you</p>
      <p>will just cancel with Sense or lockdown with Frozen Assets. Of course 
        you will want to modify the deck towards your local meta and personal 
        tastes but you should have fun playing it and gaining interaction , which 
        to me is the best part of the deck. </p>

        Looking at the light side for a change, let's see the two most feared 
        strategies are:</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>1) Operatives kill most space decks by the -1 drain</p>
      <p>2) Speeders OR EPP Swarm kills the ground by simply bashing the snot 
        out of them</p>
      <p>So, why not combine as many as possible in the one deck?</p>

      <p>Effects:</p>

      <p>Draw Their Fire</p>
      <p>Starships:</p>
      <p>2xTantive 4</p>
      <p>Spiral</p>
      <p>Gold Leader in Gold 1</p>
      <p>Red Leader in Red 1</p>
      <p>So, for the other side to come and fight, it costs a lot, and you can 
        hit them pretty hard anyway. If they're playing in space, the Tantive 
        4 should be able to cancel the ABC, and the other ships, combined with 
        all the pilots, should be able to cause some trouble.<br>

        Hidden Base</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p><b>Prologue:</b> This deck has been extremely successful, winning a preliminary 
        qualifier and a local tournament. It grew out of a few sets of ideas; 
        one, David Akers was discussing the strategic concept of placing the opponent 
        on the horns of a dilemma by confronting him in two</p>
      <p>theaters, forcing him to choose. This is particularly effective with 
        an objective like Hidden Base when resources are tight. The other inspiration 
        goes back to the Judo Chop Civil Disorder / Throne Room decks from last 
        year, during the JP era. I remember seeing this deck on the internet, 
        and marveling at how much pressure it put on the opponent with resource 
        choke, Civil Disorder, and the character horde. And also some inspiration 
        from Neal Razi, with his non-Monnok-able Hidden Base concept. Thus was 
        born, the 30-cards+-with-ability-HB-deck.</p>

      <p>Play Notes-</p>
      <p>If you've looked over the card list, you're probably thinking... gee, 
        looks like someone just pulled 60 random cards out of their collection. 
        We're all so inundated with non-unique swarms. This brings us to the first 
        key - this deck is extremely resistant to Monnok. The diverse characters 
        and starships give you the luxury of building hand size and deploying 
        when and where you're ready, without having to 'dump your hand' because 
        you started with too many doubles.</p>
      <p>Unlike a lot of Objective decks that 'play themselves', ie, they are 
        designed to operate irregardless of your opponent's posture, this deck 
        is designed to put you in a position to win any duel by outplaying the 
        opponent. Therefore, I can only offer general advice: you pull some</p>
      <p>force generation systems with HB (Bespin, Tatooine) and then go to the 
        ground with the character horde. The deploy choke of Goo Nee Tay, Coruscant, 
        and a timely H'Nemthe are all designed to assist. Don't flip Hidden Base 
        until absolutely necessary. If you get beaten off the</p>
      <p>ground, time for Plan B... flip Hidden Base and drain them out in space. 
        When the opponent attempts to engage you strategically someplace, go for 
        Plan B again - flip Hidden Base, choke their resources, and place them 
        on the 'horns of a dilemma'.</p>
      <p>Starting Effect varies based on the opponent. Draw Their Fire against 
        ISB and Goo Nee Tay vs Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi. The deploy cost 
        adders, a flipped Hidden Base, and Civil Disorder on the table, puts an 
        incredible amount of pressure on Hunt Down. Draw their Fire and the large 
        number of characters, along with the drain cancellers (Hidden Base, The 
        Planet its Farthest From, Projection of a Skywalker, and Undercover) should 
        keep you ahead of ISB. Harc Seff is pretty cool, too. The only deck type 
        unaccounted for in any way is SFS; if you see</p>
      <p>an SFS deck that can make it past No Shelter and Operatives, well - that's 
        some SFS tech I wanna see, too! Send it over!</p>
      <p>In space battles, the superior forfeit of the light side pilots, along 
        with the Bacta Tank / Redemption combo, makes all the difference. There 
        are a number of easy to track destiny 5's that can cause quite a bit of 
        attrition in space.</p>
      <p>This deck has lots of room for customization to your local meta. If JP 
        ETE is popular, Uh-Oh makes a good defensive card instead of Goo Nee Tay. 
        If people actually play SFS, add in some Push cards. Also, since I tend 
        to camp out at Coruscant, there's a good reason to make the</p>
      <p>Hidden Base Kiffex. If the opponent probes the Outer Rim, there's a chance 
        they won't have the hyper speed to make it Kiffex from Bespin. If they 
        go to Kiffex, they're within battle-range of the fleet. Dust off those 
        crappy 2 power / ability pilots and grow mighty in the force!</p>

      <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size=5>Deck Partitioning</font><font size=2><br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size=2>partition (n.): something that divides 
        or seperates. <br>
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>Whenever I tell people that I partition my deck, they usually ask me 
        what I mean. I respond to them with generally the same stuff that I'm 
        going to write in this article. Deck partitioning can be executed many 
        ways. In this article, I'm going to go over the pro's and con's of each 
        way, and tell you which method I myself recommend. After reading this 
        and trying deck partitioning out once or twice, I think that it ultimately 
        will help you in your overall game play. </p>
      <p>Before I go into the types of deck partitioning, I want to explain what 
        it is. Basically, it's just saying like "OK, I'm gonna dedicate only 30 
        cards to getting so and so done. No more, no less. And then I'll dedicate 
        10 cards to keep Force drains from hurting me much, and so on and so forth". 
      </p>
      <b> 
      <p>I. Partition by Card Type </p>
      </b> 
      <p>With this partition method, you'd basically just decide on how many characters, 
        locations, etc. you wanted, and keep that constant true throughout the 
        deckmaking process. I can't really see any advantage that you'd allow 
        yourself to receive by doing this, except that you'd always be able to 
        approximate how many cards of that specific type you had remaining in 
        your deck at any given time. But really, you should know that anyway. 
        But I suppose that partitioning this way could make it easier to remember. 
        Try it and tell me! </p>
      <b> 
      <p>II. Partition by Destiny Number </p>
      </b> 
      <p>This method of partition is, in my opinion, only somewhat helpful. This 
        type of partitioning, obviously, is only really good for decks that rely 
        on high destinies (such as Sabbac or real battletype decks), but not really 
        useful at all unless you say "Alright, I'll dedicate 15 destiny 4 cards 
        that will be used solely for battling". So this really could help you 
        because you'd have your battle deck, but also know which destinies you'd 
        have left, etc. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>III. Partition by Ultimate Goal </p>
      </b> 
      <p>I'm not sure that's exactly the best way to say this, but I'll explain. 
        This partition method is my personal favorite, and I often use it (especially 
        with the objective decks). Basically, you just say "I wanna dedicate 30 
        cards to getting Luke's butt trained as fast as possible. I wanna dedicate 
        another 20 to battling/drain sites. And the rest will go to hindering 
        my opponent". That's more or less (mostly less ;) how I partitioned my 
        Mind What You Have Learned deck. This method is wonderful. It really lets 
        you break your deck down, so that you have the bare essentials to pulling 
        off several different strategies, but also a few extras to enhance those 
        strategies. Generally, the only problem with this (which is a problem 
        with all decks, partitioned or not) is that your deck will be too large. 
        If this happens, simply increase the partition on one category, and reduce 
        it on the other. And if that doesn't work, you're just gonna have to scratch 
        some cards. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>IV. Partition by All of the Above </p>
      </b> 
      <p>This is no doubt, one of the better methods of partitioning. All you 
        have to do is, using the third method as a base, figure out the utopian 
        way that you can splice card type, destiny, AND general strategy into 
        one partition. </p>
      <p>So overall, partitioning greatly enhances card efficiency. It's not only 
        a good way of building decks, but taking them apart too (making sure that 
        you don't have any uncescessary cards in there). So try partitioning your 
        decks for the upcoming tournament. If it works for you and you wanna keep 
        doing it, that's cool. If it doesn't work for you and you wanna refrain 
        from doing it, that's cool too. Just be sure to use whatever deckbuilding 
        method that you're most comfortable with. Until next article, see ya later!</p>

      <p>Grabbed by 'A New Hope'</p>
      </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>'A New Hope' is my favorite SWCCG expansion so far. This puts me in a 
        very small minority among gamers and I think I can see why. The major 
        theme of A New Hope - CPI versus Attack Run is almost completely unplayable 
        in a non-themed tournament environment. Although I did not start playing 
        the game until after the Dagobah expansion, I think I can understand the</p>
      <p>disappointment people must have felt when the much anticipated climactic 
        scene of the first movie turned out not to be viable in tourneys. </p>
      <p>That being said, however, 'A New Hope' has many of the most useful and 
        equalizing cards in the game. Every other expansion has powerful cards 
        for one or both sides -- but A New Hope has the staple cards that bring 
        balance to the force. </p>
      <p>I refer to "grabber" cards: </p>
      <p>*&#9;There'll Be Hell To Pay</p>
      <p>*&#9;Tentacle</p>
      <p>*&#9;What Are You Trying To Push On Us?</p>
      <p>*&#9;Grappling Hook</p>
      <p>"Grimnok"</p>
      <p>*&#9;Grimtash</p>
      <p>*&#9;Monnok</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Damage Control"</p>
      <p>*&#9;Houjix</p>
      <p>*&#9;Ghhhk</p>
      <p>"Transport Control"</p>
      <p>*&#9;Quite a Mercenary</p>
      <p>*&#9;Oota Goota Solo</p>
      <p>"Sniper Cards"</p>
      <p>*&#9;Sniper</p>
      <p>*&#9;Sorry About the Mess</p>
      <p>Undercover</p>
      <p>*&#9;Undercover</p>
      <p>*&#9;U-3P0</p>
      <p>There are a few others that don't fit into the above categories but have 
        become staples as well: </p>
      <p>*&#9;Wedge Antilles</p>
      <p>*&#9;Tantive IV</p>
      <p>*&#9;Danz Borin</p>
      <p>*&#9;Mosep</p>
      <p>Notice that, of the cards listed above, only 3 are rares. Outside of 
        Premier, these are the cards are central to playing or countering most 
        strategies. Are you playing spread and drain? You'll want to pack Houjix 
        or Ghhhk. Lots of red cards but no SAC? Get out the "grabbers." Going 
        after</p>
      <p>your opponent's hand? "Grimnok" is still the way to go. We all know what 
        these cards do and how valuable they are. So I will quit with the rhetorical 
        questions. You get the point. </p>
      <p>What really brought the importance of this expansion to my attention 
        was the "Bespin and Beyond" tournament format. When these cards were not 
        available to me or to my opponent, I realized how central they have become 
        to the game. A quick review of my tournament deck lists confirmed this. 
        Every single deck had one or more cards from the "A New Hope" expansion. 
        This</p>
      <p>Is the only expansion of which this was true. The cards I missed the 
        most (or was glad not to have to worry about - depending on the situation) 
        were the 'grabbers' </p>
      <p>For me the 'grabbers' represent the essence of good tactics in SWCCG. 
        They are not used to deal with specific threats but rather with a specific 
        type of threat - the interrupt. To use 'grabbers' effectively, you have 
        to be able to marshal your resources - either save enough force or use 
        one of the effects that makes them free to use. You also have to be able 
        to size up your opponent's strategy and make shrewd guesses about the 
        key interrupts. Sometimes this is easy -- like playing 'There'll be Hell 
        to Pay' on 'It Could Be Worse.' Other times it can be an agonizing decision 
        - do you 'Grapple' his 'Sense' and protect yourself against having more 
        battle interrupts 'Sensed' this turn (but prevent yourself from 'Sensing' 
        his battle interrupts yourself)? Or do you let the 'Sense' go through 
        and hope he is not sitting on a couple more? These decisions often are 
        the</p>
      <p>Deciding factors in close games and sometimes the ultimate effect is 
        not immediately obvious. Many decks rely on playing used interrupts to 
        recycle high destinies back into the reserve deck. This is a very powerful 
        technique in the hands of a skilled player. You can play the used interrupt 
        as soon as you draw it - limiting vulnerability to Grimnok. Well ... one 
        'There'll be Hell to Pay' or 'What are You Trying to Push on Us?' can 
        ruin this approach; and the effectiveness lies in the 5s and 6s he/she 
        is not able to track. It is a powerful impact but it is not obvious. </p>
      <p>What's especially attractive about these cards is the fact that they 
        can not be cancelled by any means. The only effective counters are indirect 
        - cards that attack the opponents force pile, grimnoking away multiple 
        copies, etc. Or you can build decks that don't rely heavily on multiples 
        of</p>
      <p>particular interrupts. Another attractive feature is that you don't need 
        to devote a huge amount of deck space to them. I like to take 2 - 4 in 
        a typical deck. The destinies are reasonably high (3 and 5) and they are 
        not unique. So you can use every copy that you take (assuming that you 
        don't tale more than 3 'There'll be Hell to Pay' or 'What are You Trying 
        to Push on Us') -- a major benefit in an effect card.</p>
      <p>'Grabbers' are also nicely deceptive in their purpose. They look like 
        defensive cards. After all, they thwart your opponent's use of damaging 
        interrupts. What they really do, however, is create a gap in your opponent's 
        defenses. Thus allowing you to better pursue your offensive strategy. 
        In fact, these cards are so deceptive in their purpose that they often 
        fool players into leaving them out of their decks. They lack the obvious, 
        straightforward punch of other cards and are often overlooked - fortunately 
        for some of us. </p>

      <p>Most Common Mistakes<br>
      </p>
      </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>What is the most common mistake I have made? Well, it’s one I still occasionally 
        make, but only rarely, and usually only in Sealed Deck.</p>
      <p>It’s failing to maintain enough ships/characters to draw battle destiny. 
        This error cost me dearly my first few games of a tournament. Luckily, 
        the guy who grounded my deck to pulp in my second game advised me on the 
        error, and I managed to avoid it the rest of the day. However, I made 
        the same mistake several times over the next few tournaments, and still 
        do on occasion in Sealed Deck tournaments where my mind has become distracted 
        by the awful pulls I had, and I forget to forfeit the Z-95 Headhunter 
        that can’t move away on its own.</p>
      <p>I think this is the one area that really needs to be hammered into new 
        players’ heads. More than anything else, you must be able to draw battle 
        destiny. If you cannot draw battle destiny, it’s better to suffer the 
        Force drain for a turn or two than lose ten cards in a beatdown. It’s 
        a point I’ve tried to drill home in several of the players I have taught, 
        and I often wish it had been hammered home for me before I hit the tournament 
        scene. It may not have saved me those first few games, but I certainly 
        think it would have helped with differential.</p>

      <font size=2> 
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>I was eager to write about this particular topic because, quite frankly, 
        it is a topic that I know something about. I have made many, many, mistakes 
        in my tournament experience. Hopefully by sharing them with you, you will 
        be able to avoid them in your gameplay.</p>
      <u> 
      <p>Patience is a Virtue</p>
      </u></font><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>One of my biggest problems for a time was rushing my game. Sometimes 
        I did not give my strategy a chance to set up, especially if my opponent 
        was off to a fast start. Now do not get me wrong, having a deck that is 
        flexible enough to respond to an opponent’s strategy is a good thing. 
        And being able to adapt your own strategy and play style to defeat your 
        opponent is an admirable quality. But it is often a thin line between 
        when you should stick to your guns and when you need to start playing 
        defense.</p>
      <p>For example, once I was playing a MWYHL/Mains deck. MWYHL was just a 
        force generation engine. The heart of the deck was designed to win the 
        game in one decisive battle. The general game plan was to get Yoda’s Hut, 
        and Yoda out on the first turn. Then I deployed my mains to Cloud City 
        interior sites (to avoid walkers) along with Pucimir, and then possibly 
        a Boshek or some other expendable ability 4 character to Dagobah using 
        the first Jedi test. With Pucimir and the first Jedi Test complete, the 
        DS was forced to spread out if they were to win a force drain race. Once 
        they spread out I was generally only a Draw Their Fire/Frozen Assets/Clash 
        of Sabers/Jedi Presence/Nabrun away from victory. </p>
      <p>So in one game I was playing against an ISB deck. It was not drop and 
        drain, but my opponent seemed to get it working in no time. He dropped 
        the Audience Chamber on his first turn. This was followed next turn by 
        Jabba and an ORS. I noted that the ORS now had a forfeit of five. &quot;Nice.&quot;, 
        I thought. More big Tatooine drain sites came out, along with ORS’s and 
        probe droids. The Audience Chamber game text was used to get Ak-Rev, who 
        then pulled Rystall. So he was doing musician retrieval as well. His drains 
        were taking their toll and mine were not. I was having trouble finding 
        my mains. Eventually I got my band together and was ready to go... almost. 
        I had EPP Han, Chewie, EPP Leia, Obi, and Luke, a Jedi Presence, a Don’t 
        Get Cocky, a Clash of Sabers, and a Nabrun. What was missing? Frozen Assets. 
        Draw Their Fire was on the table, but I was missing the second part of 
        the combo. </p>
      <p>Well, I was getting drained pretty badly. I figured if I did not do it 
        now, I would lose on drains. So I went for it. I declared Nabrun. He had 
        no response. I paid my transport cost. No Oota - Goota. I was relieved. 
        I initiated battle and won. 4 to 43 or so. I didn’t even use Clash, as 
        I had played Scramble already. I thought I had won, smashed him, nailed 
        him. Then he Ghhk’s. </p>
      <p>Ouch! I did not know it right away, but that was the game. </p>
      <p>Frozen Assets was one of my destiny draws, so it was not too hard to 
        find again. By the next turn I had drawn another Nabrun and a Frozen Assets. 
        This time I thought I had him. I declared Nabrun. He plays Tarkin’s Orders. 
        Tarkin’s Orders? He didn’t have a ship in his deck. Those Rebels Won’t 
        Escape Us I could believe, but not Tarkin’s Orders. Anyway, I hunted for 
        another Nabrun, but the drains were too much. By the time I drew it I 
        didn’t have enough force in my deck to make sure I could pay for transport 
        and use weapons and draw destiny. I activated 3, as much as I could activate 
        and still have an effective battle. I drew a five for Nabrun’s cost. I 
        was done. He drained me next turn, and that was it.</p>
      <p>After the game he told me he had taken his Imperial Supply’s out of his 
        deck. He did not believe that anyone in this area played the DTF/FA combo. 
        So I blew it. If I had waited another turn, I could have won that game. 
        But I moved too soon, abandoned a piece of my game plan and paid the price. 
        Now I am much more willing to give up a drains for a turn or two rather 
        than mount a half-hearted, ineffective offensive. It was a good, if painful, 
        lesson to learn.</p>
      <u> 
      <p>Concentrating on the Wrong Thing</p>
      <p> </p>
      </u> 
      <p>This is the problem that is currently causing me the most problems. Believe 
        it or not, I am forgetting to rather important things, like retrieve force. 
        I currently am running an ISB/Mains mix. There are not a ton of agents, 
        so I usually can not retrieve every turn. However, I have lost several 
        games because I forgot to retrieve an agent when I had one to retrieve. 
        How do I miss it? I find on focus on the other parts of the game, and 
        I just lose my head.</p>
      <p>For example, I was playing against a Hidden Base deck. It was end game. 
        We were both set up at our draining sites. After much battling, I had 
        rescued Coruscant from the rebel scum, but TPIFF was targeting Tatooine 
        and it was hurting my drains. It would be while before I could get my 
        fleet down to Dagobah. And at this rate they would be more useful blocking 
        the LS drains. So I turned my attention to how to best blocking those 
        drains without getting smashed. It was one of those games that they person 
        who drained last was going to win. I had five cards in my life force, 
        and my opponent drained for five. He won with a differential of two. One 
        more turn and I would have won. If I had retrieved only one more agent, 
        I would have won the game. But I didn’t</p>
      <p>And it is not just a DS problem. In a recent Bespin &amp; Beyond tournament, 
        I was playing a Cloud City Celebration/ Devaronian/ Tessek deck. My opponent 
        was playing a DS operative deck. I had just set up the Celebration. I 
        had Pucimir on CC and Tessek in the Audience Chamber. My drains were going 
        to be big. But the turn after I set it up, out came Coruscant and ABCTTU. 
        With the flipped objective and that effect, I had no drains on Cloud City. 
        My concentration went to how to get rid of ABCTTU, and I forgot to retrieve 
        for 3 turns. Even at 2 a turn, that is six force that I missed. It was 
        stupid. And again the person that drained last won. And again it was not 
        me. With six extra force on my side, it would have been a win. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Like Episode One teaches us, we must be mindful of the future, but not 
        at the expense of the moment.</p>
      <u> 
      <p>Sweating the Small Stuff</p>
      </u> 
      <p>Here is a collection of some of my other notable screw-ups. The stories 
        are not as good, but hopefully they will still prove to be a cautionary 
        example.</p>
      </font> 
      <dir><font face="Arial" size=2> 
        <p>1) &#9;Even if you have a counter to your opponent’s play, read the 
          card! For example, don’t let your opponent deploy TK-422 unless you 
          have an Imperial at the site. Once I missed that. I had a walker with 
          an alien pilot. Down came TK-422. I didn’t notice the issue until the 
          next turn, right after the two tramples I had in my hand failed to take 
          him out of action. </p>
        <p>2) &#9;Don’t try to count cards unless you know what you are doing. 
          It was a sealed deck. I had control of Tatooine the system, while my 
          opponent was draining for two at the Tusken Canyon. I had It’s A Hit 
          in my hand. All I had to do was to make sure I drew It’s A Hit every 
          other turn. I counted my life force, 8 cards. I played the interrupt 
          and moved two ships. So I thought, &quot;Hey, I need two force for next 
          turn, so activate 11.&quot; I did, I moved two ships again, and I drew 
          one card. No It’s A Hit. I drew again, and again, and again. Nope, it 
          was not there. &quot;What happened?&quot;, I wondered. Given that this 
          was sealed deck and I had no Reactor Terminal every card I drew in excess 
          of the amount I was being force drained cost me differential. Not to 
          mention the fact that if I had done this right there would not be a 
          drain at all. But I blew it. Now I still try to rig destinies, but usually 
          only in friendly games, or if it is the top card using some type of 
          interrupt. The moral here is experiment at the game shop and not the 
          tournament table.</p>
        <p>3) &#9;Whatever deck you decide to play, make sure you play test it 
          extensively first. I have learned that it is the well-tested and tuned 
          deck that wins, not the new &quot;hot&quot; deck. Many people search 
          the internet for deck ideas. This is a good idea. But hunting the internet 
          for actual decks is not. Maybe this works for some. But I have never 
          had much success using anyone else’s deck. Sure, those decks beat the 
          lesser skilled opponents that I face, but the good ones always seem 
          to shut me down. The decks I win with are the ones I have played with 
          the longest. They have gone through the most iterations and have received 
          the most testing. If you see someone has a good tactic or combo in his 
          or her deck, by all means learn from it. But like so many of my grade 
          school teachers told me, &quot;Parroting is not learning.&quot; Remember 
          that internet decks have been built in a different region. And regions 
          vary in the cards that are popular. Some regions like numbers, some 
          never play them. Some like Sense/Alter, some like Grimnok, others don't 
          play with any of those cards. Increasingly this is a game of match-ups, 
          and tuning your deck to the environment is what separates the winners 
          and the losers. Know your local metagame and build around it. Don’t 
          believe that downloading a deck will save you the trouble of doing the 
          work required to win.</p>

        Abstractions from Magic to SWCCG </p>
      </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
      <p>Or how Brian Weissman helped create Maelstrom!?!</p>
      <p><br>
        Decipher refers to it as &quot;the OTHER game&quot;. Swccg players often 
        call it &quot;the game with all that errata&quot;. I often refer to it 
        as &quot;the number one card game for a reason&quot;.</p>
      <p>Swccg players are foolishly snubbing Magic. As the first card game, a 
        wealth of very serious strategy has built up in Magic, to completely understate 
        the matter. While it is true that the two games differ to some extent, 
        many basics apply to both games and can easily be transferred over. Nearly 
        all competitive events are similar psychologically. Don’t crack, don’t 
        &quot;tip your hand &quot;, remain calm, don’t underestimate your opponent. 
        Take basic card playing strategy, such as don’t burn out your hand needlessly, 
        examine the other players cards out, try to anticipate what he may deploy 
        next turn based on his resources or what he has already played. Also, 
        know the local area and the gamers, be on guard for cheating. While these 
        comparisons are quite obvious with a little thought, an area that is not 
        as obvious in similarity is in deck construction.</p>
      <p>Remember that Magic is much older than swccg and the players are just 
        as serious about the game, probably more due to the pro-tour. Very, very 
        smart people have poured hours and hours into constructing decks that, 
        in their time, could crush nearly all opposition. Some ideas were better 
        than others and managed to hit underlying themes, hidden &quot;patterns&quot;, 
        if you will, and have outlasted their rivals, and spawned numerous decks 
        based on the same principle. These are usually referred to as an Archetype. 
        Now, my idea has been that perhaps the same &quot;hidden patterns&quot; 
        exist unbeknownst to us in swccg. I believe I have proof of that, but 
        I am very secretive, and had not I found Deck Tech such a very valuable 
        resource, I never would have shared these ideas, lest some super deck 
        crush me. With that being said, let’s break down a few Magic deck types, 
        and you’ll see where this ends up, and strangely it ends up at maelstrom, 
        which, unerrated was the most powerful deck I had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Ok, back in the days when Magic first started the first actual archetype, 
        one which, of course is still used today, was landkill. By destroying 
        the opponent’s power resources, you made it impossible for him to generate 
        enough energy to stop you. This is a basic warfare technique, cut off 
        the enemies’ supply lines. In Magic, this is frequently done by destroying 
        an opponent’s land, or by making it unusable, through cards such as Winter 
        Orb. This is now basically known as &quot;The Prison&quot; in Magic. Swccg 
        has also come across this, and although destroying land is very difficult, 
        only a few CPI decks really try this, locking down the opponent’s force 
        generation is very strong. This explains the strength of decks like Pavlik’s 
        No Shelter. By Revolution-ing the opponent’s force generation early you 
        are able to build up a nearly unstoppable force. Cards such as Beggar 
        and Frozen Assets also work well with this. Their also was once a Sleen, 
        Imperial Domination, Shot in the Dark deck, where you’d quickly remove 
        all the opponents force generation, and use Broken Concentration to remove 
        his only force. This basically caused the errata of Shot in the Dark. 
        Revolution, Beggar, Broken Concentration, as well as others, these cards 
        will always be powerful, and will always have to be guarded against, because 
        they are not gimmicks, they break through to the core of what is happening 
        in the mechanics of the game.</p>
      <p>Next deck type nearly directly transferable, &quot; The Permission Deck&quot;. 
        In a permission deck, your offense is nearly minimal, but the idea is 
        to thwart everything the opponent tries to set up, and when he’s run out 
        of options, you either ping him to death, or crush him very quickly with 
        a large unstoppable attack. The heart of these decks, in Magic are generally 
        removal spells, and more importantly, Counterspells(and their variants) 
        and Disenchants. These cards run almost parallel with Sense and Alter. 
        Now Decipher has gone a long way in trying to ruin sense and alter for 
        some unknown reason (I guess they don’t think they are &quot;fun&quot; 
        or something), but even so the ability to stop someone’s plan of attack 
        at a crucial moment will ALWAYS be very powerful. Turn back the clock 
        2 ½ years, before Cloud City came out. What was the Light side playing? 
        More often than not, Dagobah Revolution. Sit on Dagobah where it’s safe, 
        get great warrior going, get some spies down and Sense and Alter EVERYTHING! 
        When ready, throw down the revolutions and sit back and watch the drains 
        come. A Permission deck by any other name, and a powerful one at that. 
        Dagobah clouds, same thing before Special Edition, after setting up the 
        defense, get a few wusses in the clouds for a couple drains a turn, even 
        with Imperial Decree, stop everything via sense and alter, and drain preventers, 
        and let the pinging begin! Once again, very powerful.</p>
      <p>Let’s go from the sublime to the ridiculous, and talk about speed decks. 
        First turn Juzams and Juggernauts, meet Turbo Dark Deal. By setting up 
        a massive offense very quickly, kill the opponent before he has a chance 
        to even set up. Force Drains of 16 on the third turn in the unerrated 
        operatives, to people Hurling Ball Lightnings before they die for 12 Hit 
        Points, it can be just sickening. Due to the many ridiculous decks created 
        in this style, from both games, I’m not even going to discuss it, just 
        mention it. I’m sure any of us could think of all manners of crazy speed 
        decks.</p>
      <p>I’ve got two things from Magic left to discuss, and I’m going to take 
        a break and talk about one that I doubt is transferable, but, by putting 
        it out in the open who knows, maybe someone will see something I haven’t. 
        I have seen an Inkling of this in only one deck I’ve made and I’ll share 
        it and see what you guys can cook up. This is the Archetype known as &quot;The 
        Reanimator&quot; deck. This is primarily the realm of Black in Magic, 
        by using discard cards and effects such as Merfolk Trader and Bazaar of 
        Baghdad, you actually TRY to throw stuff into your graveyard. Ok, sounds 
        stupid, but there are a few strange cards in Magic, namely Living Death, 
        Animate Dead, Shallow Grave and Buried Alive, and a couple creatures I 
        won’t go into here. These cards let you get stuff OUT of your graveyard, 
        and cheaply! You try to throw out some incredibly HUGE, unstoppable creature, 
        say a sliver queen as quickly as possible, that would normally be almost 
        impossible to get out, then animate him(I guess her in this case), and 
        all of a sudden your opponent is looking at some 7/7 creature on the third 
        turn! It’d be like if on the first turn of the game, you threw out the 
        executor, then on the second, put him down via an effect on the opponent’s 
        lone x-wing and battled! Get the idea? The really strange thing about 
        this, is if you can get the cards back, it becomes a great way of manipulating 
        your Library (reserve deck) because you now know exactly where the cards 
        you want are! Ok, (secret tech time) so the card that comes closest to 
        this is Tibrin. I used to see so many people laugh when I put this out 
        in my space decks that, if laughing caused a loss, I’d be winless. Fortunately, 
        the laughers were wrong. Throwing three force out is not bad if you get 
        back a card that get you MORE than three force, or prevents the loss of 
        more than three force. Out a card goes, you now know where it is, and 
        back it comes. I used to use it to get Kessel Runs, On the Edges, Obi-wan, 
        spies, ultimatum, you name it!! A truly underrated card. Now see what 
        kind of other crazy stuff you can use it for, I actually hadn’t thought 
        about it for a long while. Hmmm, special edition, there is all kinds of 
        crazy stuff in there I bet, like Harvest! See what else you can come up 
        with and let me know, this could get interesting!</p>
      <p>Ok, last abstraction, this is where it gets serious, and this is what 
        the title refers to. The principle we will discuss here is CARD ADVANTAGE. 
        Card advantage is the attempt to outdraw your opponent, to increase the 
        amount of cards in your hand, and decrease the amount in his to an ideal 
        of zero. In Magic, this has led to easily the two most powerful decks 
        of all time, &quot;The Necro deck&quot;, and the one that is known simply 
        as &quot;The Deck&quot; (created by Brian Weissman), due to it’s incredible 
        synergy. The Deck is a permission deck that uses every color, and nearly 
        every power card. Once it’s set up allows you to draw 2, 3 or even 4 cards 
        a turn, and the opponent is reduced to zero, and when he draws a card, 
        he either plays it or loses it. The keys to this are counterspells and 
        removal and Moat, knocking out everything, get out a Disrupting Scepter 
        to knock out his cards, and use Library Of Alexandria, Jayemdae Tome, 
        and Ancestral Recall and Braingeyser to draw multiple. If you ever play 
        this, you will be amazed at what it can do, the opponent literally can 
        not do anything, and you are just zipping through your library, until 
        you come to the few offensive cards, and you let him have it, he’ll be 
        done it a few turns. </p>
      <p>So about six months ago, I think, right before SE, I became interested 
        in this, so I started to think about how I could use this incredible strategy. 
        I started telling our good friend and editor David Akers about The Deck, 
        and going on and on about how playing it on the Net was just an incredible 
        experience, because the opponent could do NOTHING. I was focusing on knocking 
        cards out of the opponents hand, cycling though with How Did We Get Into 
        This Mess (I think I may have it solved, but we’ll see how it holds up). 
        So I remember the fateful day, David says on the phone, &quot;well, I 
        think I’ve got the problem solved the other way, as for drawing cards&quot;. 
        We had talked about Droid Merchants, previously, but I was really looking 
        in to reducing the opponent’s hand. By Spaceport Speedering Droids, an 
        incredible amount of force could be generated, and by pulling out a hydroponics 
        station with the farm’s game text, you could continually draw cards, then 
        How did we get into this mess, repeat until you got what you wanted. Perfect 
        I said, let’s try it out. I met him for lunch and we tried it out. The 
        cycle starts, he’s cruising through his deck, and try all the mains down 
        on the second turn against some poor slobs, and bang battle damage galore. 
        I tried it, same result. Later Added EPP mains, Jedi Presence, we were 
        seeing visions of second turn kills, absolutely incredible. Then we said 
        hey put in a landed Falcon, hell, you could get force back as well. David 
        sat on this deck for a long time, I wanted him to sit on it until I went 
        to the Star Wars celebration, but his love of the game (and desire to 
        irritate Decipher) finally won out. This truly shows how card advantage 
        can bring about something incredible, because usually in these card games, 
        you have to WAIT to get the cards into your hand! This ends that (for 
        any that has ever seen a necro deck back in it’s prime you’ll know what 
        I mean). Think of it, always having the card you need, all the time, that’s 
        what I was striving for, and David basically achieved it! </p>
      <p>So there you go, Magic is an incredible resource (as well as fun), I 
        think that should be proof enough. Study it, you are wise, ignore it, 
        you are foolish. Who knows what else is out there? I hope this got you 
        thinking. I know no one ever responds when I ask, but this time, let me 
        know via deck tech what you think up and what you think of this article. 
        I have found this to be an Eye-opening experience, and I’m sure nothing 
        but power can come out of this. Also, if people express interest (and 
        maybe even if they don’t!) I’ll write an in-depth analysis of &quot;The 
        Deck&quot; for next time. Go out and play some Magic! <br>

      <p>Decipher Swiss Preliminary</p>
      <p>13th of June 1999</p>
      <p>Etten Leur, Netherlands, Ryloth Region</p>
      <p>Tournament Director: Jan Koevoets</p>
      <p>Entrants: 20</p>
      <b><u> 
      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>Welcome to my second tournament report! I got some very nice reactions 
        on my last report from two weeks ago, that I decided to write another 
        one. It gives some kind of satisfaction that people all over the world 
        are gonna read it.</p>
      <p>This was the third preliminary in the Ryloth region and it was held in 
        Etten Leur, by local TD Jan Koevoets, to my opinion one of the best (if 
        not the best) tournament directors in our region. He always has the best 
        prize-support and gives good rulings.</p>
      <p>As some of you know, I placed 11th at the last preliminary and for this 
        tourney I wanted (again) to do my very best and try to qualify. We went 
        to the tourney by car, with Sander Dijst driving the Folkswagon. At his 
        right was our friend Michel &quot;Sleepy&quot; Oldenburg, who slept all 
        the way to Etten Leur because he went out the night before the tourney 
        and from the disco went straight to Sander’s place. Next to me in the 
        backseat, was Johan Haneveer, my friend and SWCCG-partner. During our 
        two-hour trip the awake-ones talked about the upcoming Endor-expansion, 
        discussed The Phantom Menace (one of us had already seen it on video... 
        keep it quiet!) and what we did during the last week...</p>
      <p>We talked on and on, even though I tried to get some sleep. I only slept 
        for 2 hours and 20 minutes the night before! Why? Well, I went to a concert 
        in Germany to see a Portuguese band play at a Portuguese party (in Portugal 
        last weekend it’s national day was celebrated). The band is called &quot;Xutos 
        &amp; Pontap&eacute;s&quot;, which means &quot;Shots &amp; Kicks&quot;. 
        They’ve been playing live for over 20 years now and are the best Portuguese 
        rock-band. It was an honor to see them live for the second time. It rocked! 
      </p>
      <p>The concert ended around 1:30 and we took the bus back, to arrive in 
        Amsterdam around 4:15. It was 4:30 when I got home, and after putting 
        my lightside-deck together, I went to bed around 5:20. I was a mess the 
        next morning, but the &quot;Red Bulls&quot; (a Dutch energy-drink) in 
        my backpack had to keep me watchful during the whole day. </p>
      <p>We arrived in Etten Leur early, so we had plenty of time to visit the 
        toilet, trade some cards and chat with some known faces. It was somewhat 
        around 11:30 when the tourney started.</p>
      <b><u> 
      <p>MY DECKS</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>I decided to go with two totally different decks this tourney. Johan 
        had lent me some cards last tourney and he went to this tourney too, so 
        I couldn’t make a deck with multiple Obi’s, Luke’s, etc. I visited <i>Rod 
        Lathams’</i> Trandosite (it’s a great site with very good decks!) on Friday 
        to see if there was something I could use and was used to play with. </p>
      <p>I went for an X-Wing-deck, but this time it had a twist: undercover spies! 
        I thought this to be a powerful version, because with Hidden Base you 
        have the ability to cancel two of the opponents’ drains, and if you manage 
        to get some undercover spies down, the picture gets even worse for the 
        opponent...</p>
      <p>It was harder to choose what to play for my darkside. My <i>Portuguese 
        Temperament</i>-deck hadn’t done as well as I expected last tournament, 
        so I had to play something different. At last years preliminary I played 
        a TIE deck with a Tallon Roll backup, which did very well! And this was 
        before Special Edition came out with Sienar Fleet Systems and all those 
        other powerful cards for TIE’s. I decided to seek this deck on my PC (had 
        it somewhere in an older version of Deckmaker) and change it to a modern 
        style...</p>

      </u></b><i> 
      <p>Round 1, Game 1: LS vs DS (Patrick Leenders):</p>
      </i> 
      <p>An easy start at a tournament is always good. I have the feeling I’ve 
        played Patrick some time before, but wasn’t sure. Patrick is a nice guy, 
        who stays cool during the whole game, without making annoying remarks 
        and sees SWCCG as a game as it should be. Not a matter of life and death.</p>
      <p>It was a surprise to me to see someone play with the <i>Carbon Chamber 
        Testing</i>-objective. I don’t find this to be a strong type of deck. 
        Patrick chose <i>There Is No Try</i> as his SE. It was a quick game with 
        not many interactions. He played an early <i>Monnok</i>, which caused 
        3 X-Wings to go to my Lost Pile, which was the biggest damage he caused 
        me. Afterwards he told me was searching all the time for <i>Secret Plans</i>, 
        but I don’t have <i>All Wings Report In</i> so that wouldn’t do much good.</p>
      <p>He deployed some characters to drain on CC, but I deployed an undercover 
        spy. Later on he deployed some more characters, but I battled them of 
        the table, releasing <i>Jeroen Webb</i>, which I gave him at the start 
        of the game to freeze. I already had <i>Draw Their Fire</i> on table, 
        so the damage extended. I flipped, drained and won. Result Full Win 2

      <p>Round 1, Game 2: DS vs LS (Ronald Rullens):</p>
      </i> 
      <p>Ronal Rullens. I remember playing him somewhere in 1998 and he played 
        <i>Ralltiir Operations</i> at that time. I remember that game especially, 
        which I eventually won, because it was very clear to me he had annoyed 
        me through the whole game that time, questioning my actions. But I give 
        everyone a second chance... </p>
      <p>Ronald started out with <i>Tatooine: Obi-Wan’s Party House</i> with no 
        SE. I gave it an 80% possibility it was a <i>No Shelter</i>-deck. I started 
        quickly with drains on three different systems and a lone TIE was defending 
        Wakeelmui, protecting the SFS-effect from being canceled by an Alter. 
        He then deploys the <i>Millenium Falcon</i>, with <i>Han Solo with Heavy 
        Blaster Rifle</i> and <i>Rayc Ryerd</i> piloting it, at a system where 
        I had only one TIE-Fighter. He battled and caused me 24-force damage! 
        My oh my! You’re so brave to fight a tiny TIE with a ship as big as the 
        Falcon! </p>
      <p>Thank God I had some backup in my hand, so next turn I deployed the TIEs 
        I had in my hand a couple more using the LOST version of APTW. To amass 
        the loss for him, I played Lateral Damage on the Falcon, making it power 
        and forfeit = 0. I battled him and when we started counting our power, 
        the long awaited whining started... He stated that LD only targets the 
        starfighters power, so it was MF (0)+ HS (3)+ RR (2)+ 2 destiny draws 
        (1 and 4)= 10. But I picked up LD, read and explained it’s game-text to 
        him, but he didn’t believe me as always (I talked to several other players 
        at the end of the tourney, and most of them said the same). He continued 
        sustaining his opinion and I countered it with my version. We called the 
        TD over and Jan told us that my theory was the correct one, so Ronald 
        was only power 5. I caused him a force loss of 15. From then on it was 
        just a drain and retrieve game for me. He Revolutionized Obi’s Hut, but 
        it was too late... At the end of the game he activated all the force he 
        had left and drew it into his hand, thus leaving many cards in my hand 
        which I could recycle to my Used Pile, using Reactor Terminal; a very 
        unsportsmanlike action. Result Full Win 2 (+15)</p>

      </i> 
      <p>Sander hadn’t attended a tourney since the SWCCG World Championships 
        in the USA at the end of 1998. He is good. I hadn’t played him during 
        last weeks, so I wasn’t sure what he was going to do. Sander started out 
        with <i>Hunt down and destroy the Jedi</i> and <i>First Strike</i> as 
        his SE. Sander had something very interesting against the lightside, as 
        he was only playing with Alters and no Senses; a very good strategy because 
        of all those lightside-decks that strive on certain Effects. This makes 
        his opponents also question the use of Grimtaash, because you think he 
        will <i>Sense</i> it. Sander started <i>Monnok</i>ing my hand pretty quickly, 
        making me lose key-cards, like X-Wings and some Interrupts. He managed 
        to play Monnok 3 times. Jeroen Webb made it early in the game to the Executor: 
        Holotheatre, canceling VOTE. I drained him the whole game on Kessel. He 
        had some trouble finding my hidden base, but his third probing attempt 
        was correct. We had some battles, but mostly he was in control of the 
        game because the Monnoks were so effectively played at the beginning of 
        the game. Result Full Loss 0 (-15)</p>

        Base/ X-Wing Swarm-deck. All the stories I had heard, was that TIE’s weren’t 
        a match against X-Wings. Still I wanted to state the contrary. <i>Yarna 
        D’al Gargan</i> was his SE, so the swarm was coming for sure. He early 
        deployed S-Foils and from that moment on, my TIE’s weren’t a match against 
        his powerful X-Wings. I lost mostly all of the battles and continuously 
        cancelled my drains by using <i>Rebel Fleet</i>. The stories were true,

        opponent. He is a young player and during our &quot;get-to-know&quot; 
        conversation, he told me he hadn’t started playing very long. He also 
        had a X-Wing Swarm-deck, so I immediately settled with a loss. Qualification 
        was no longer a chance for me....</p>
      <p>We started out. Yarna also was his SE. He started deploying X-Wings early 
        to Rendezvous Point and moving them to Kessel, 5 in total. </p>
      <p>But somehow, something had given me luck and gave me a lucky hand: 1 
        Dreadnaught, 5 TIE’s, 2 APTW, 3 Tallon Rolls, 2 Dark Maneuvres and 1 Lateral 
        Damage. Suddenly I saw it! I had to clean him off the table with one swift 
        stroke, just like someone said in the original trilogy (does anybody know 
        who said it? Mail it to me at: vads@xs4all.nl). I deployed the Dreadnaught, 
        the 5 TIE’s for free. Played the Lateral Damage on one of his X-Wings. 
        Used APTW to take 3 more TIE’s out of my Reserve Deck and deployed them. 
        Then I Tallon Rolled two of his X-Wings. It was a wonder! Started a battle, 
        used the other APTW to pump up my total power and the battle was over: 
        39 power against 6. This was the end for Martijn. He never managed to

      <p>My final game for the day! I sat down not knowing whom I was going to 
        play against. Nobody saw it, but I said a quick prayer to ask God for 
        luck in the next game, while Jan Koevoets called the players’ names. As 
        if God hadn’t heard me, Jan put me against Ronald Rullens again!!! Once 
        is enough on one day, but twice! That’s too much to ask for!</p>
      <p>He sat down and we (I) exchanged some cynical smiles. He started out 
        with Ralltiir Operations (remember the game analysis above?), so this 
        was a sort of Deja Vu. He probably had a bad feeling about the game, so 
        he started with <i>Bad Feeling Have I</i>. I took a look through my Effects 
        and decided that <i>Draw Their Fire</i> was the best SE against Ralltiir 
        Ops.</p>
      <p>I’ve also played Ralltiir Ops on several occasions against friends at 
        home, so I knew that you have to take control a.s.a.p. of his locations, 
        to make sure he doesn’t flip the Objective. That’s what I did on my first 
        turn; deployed a X-Wing on Bespin and moved it to the Ralltiir system, 
        thus controlling a Ralltiir location. Soon afterwards I deployed a undercover 
        spy to his site. Battled him with Melas and later on with Obi-Wan and 
        Luke. He never managed to flip. I had plenty of time to deploy my systems 
        and flipped. He started probing, but also in space I was the stronger 
        side. Managed to battle him off the Corulag-system before he could probe 
        it.</p>
      <p>Obviously he started to whine (again) and this time he really made me 
        mad! We called Jan to settle the discussion and he gave agreed with me, 
        but even then Ronald didn’t believe it 100%. He contradicted everything 
        I said. I was fed up with him. I deserved to win, and so I did (I won 
        because he drew all his Life Force from table, again...). Result Full

      <p>Comparing my score to last tournament, I was very happy. I had done better 
        and this tourney showed me that the decks I played with this time were 
        more effective than those last time. </p>
      <p>I haven’t qualified for the regional yet, but the next one will be held 
        by Bas van Zuilen hopefully somewhere in July. My lightside deck could 
        be improved with a <i>Traffic Control</i> and my darkside deck with a 
        <i>Monnok</i> or two...</p>
      <p>It was a fun tournament and the first tourney I didn’t have to play against 
        Johan Haneveer (we always have). I didn’t want to sound arrogant in the 
        game analysis above against Ronald Rullens, but it just isn’t fun to play 
        against him. People who know me think of me of a joyous person, with a 
        good sense of humor and as I stated I give everyone the benefit of the 
        doubt.</p>
      <p>It was also surprising to see that Johan Haneveer (one of the top players 
        in the Netherlands) ended up 15th, one of his all-time lowest results.</p>
      <p>At this tournament the Hidden Base reigned! I heard a lot of people around 
        me complain about it. I wonder if Endor isn’t gonna bring more types of 
        swarm to the tournament scene. We already have seen five cards related 
        to Speeder Bikes, so I can see them flying up and down the many Endor-sites 
        causing pain to the lightside... Only time will tell.</p>
      <p>Congratulations to Maarten Rossou and Sander Dijst for qualifying for 
        the Regional in September; good luck to you all! Thanks to Jan Koevoets 
        for the Preliminary, the good prize-support and supplying me with the 
        Tournament Results! Also, finally my thanks to Martijn de Vrieze for borrowing 
        me a couple of cards! Thanks man!</p>
