    A few days before the tourney the sealed Jabba&#146;s palace cards were released, looking at them I have to say they aren&#146;t to bad but there were two cards that I didn&#146;t realy like, No Escape and Ounee Ta.  I don&#146;t play decks that are hurt by these cards but I think they are not warranted, First I have never had that much problem with honour, I played hunt down, alot since Death star 2 and never found Honour that bad,  thing I liked is people felt honour alone was good enough against huntdown and they got hurt badly because of it.  I admit I hate cards that are designed to wreck deck ideas, unless the deck idea was very bad for the game in the first place, numbers I can see cancellers for, but these two cards can just kill Raltiir, more ops and DBO(Why do they need to hurt DBO?).<br>
     Seeing these cards I decided, well I traded for a DBO just before D* 2 came out just it case it got better with it, I better try and use it before it gets hosed even more.  So I decide I will try DBO for this tourney.  Being the procrastinator that I have always been, I kept putting off building my decks. Finally tourney day i wake up 2 hours before the tourney starts and decide to build a DBO deck. I decide since I only own about 2 y-wing squadrons and no others to pass I trying to play with squadrons. I play strike planning, scouts and just play to take advantage of the +2 deploy and the -1 to force drains for my opponent. Added in close air support to try out as well.<br>
    With all the procrastinating I didn&#146;t have time to make a new dark deck so I played BHBM like I did the week before, It was made from my high destiny duelling huntdown, just, took out alot of the duelling cards and changed starting stuff, left in 2 The Circle Is Now Complete to keep Ben out of the picture.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
Light Side: DBO(get some games in it before it gets screwed over)<br>
Dark Side: High Destiny BHBM<br>
<br>
    Arrive at the tourney seen about 11, tourneys tend to start between 11-12, realize I forgot DBO Objective for my deck, find out tourney is suppose to start 11:30, quickly run home and get it. (I live about a 15 minute walk away from the place)  Get back, another person shows up about 11:30. Tourney Director shows up at 11:45 and there is only 2 of us. We talk a bit, do some trades, a few more show up.  Some people play some fun games.  Finally about 1:00 get 8 people together to sanction the tourney.  Store Closes at 6:00 so we decide on 4 games they we tend to play 6 games around here.  Finally the Tourney starts.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My BHBM vs Stu&#146;s EBO<br>
    Since Death Star 2 came out I haven&#146;t lost to EBO.  I start IAO, MP and Imperial Decree. Frst turn pull D* 2 DB and place emperor there. My Opponent goes activates pulls EBO drops two of his sites from his hand, activated the third because he forgot to pull it before he activated. deploys Luke skywalker from reserve for 1 force to 4th marker.  Dropped some scrubs on Luke, beat on him.  Won the battle, he stacked, not enough damage to beat Luke&#146;s forfiet, He managed to battle me off Hoth and then set up EBO. I dropped Lord Vader and stick down to 4th marker, wedge and luke were at the MPG. Took a big risk and let vader sit there. On his turn he just moved Luke over. Took another risk, drained with a lone vader, still nothing, then rise my friend vader to D*2 DB, and get duellingh started on him to make him lose force.  Rest of the game was fairly uneventful, First strike, zuckuss and bossk beat the crap out of Calrissian on Falcon getting second stack, they then got quickly beat out of space, kept decree set up for all but 1 turn which he ended up getting a drain of 6 in, He was getting drained for 3 and getting duelled for 3 damage each turn. In the end I battled him out right before I had the chance to cross him after finally getting the third card stacked. Win by 18<br>
2(+18)<br>
Highs: Still undefeated against EBO since D* 2<br>
Lows: Not keeping Decree in effect the whole game.<br>
<br>
I guess Dark side won all there games first round.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My DBO vs Lloyd&#146;s Flipping Court<br>
Lloyd likes to put fun of the game ahead of competition, but he has been in the game for a long time and is a fairly good player.  This is my first game with DBO ever so I expect to make mistakes playing it.  Court is a bad matchup for DBO because of the aliens not costing more.  I start Staging Areas, Inserrection and Strike Planning. He pulls Tattoine DB first turn and sets up some aliens in the chamber.  My first turn my screw ups began.  The smart thing to do would have been to signal for honour, maybe set up a scrub at Home One DB and leave it at that, Instead I deployed Jedi Luke to Home One DB and move him over to tatooine.  Luke gets attacked by ECC 4lom and Djas Puhr 4lom shoots Luke and he plays Jabba&#146;s through with you to add a destiny. we both draw fairly low, Luke lost his immunity though so, Luke and djas go, and 4lom takes Luke do to all wrapped up.  First turn I forgot to pull a dantooine site so I don&#146;t have the locations to set up second turn, I get it set up third turn though. Meanwhile he gets Luke over to the Dungeon and chucks him in and retrieves his 2, flipped and started pulling out the rancor stuff. Afraid of Luke getting eaten, I foolishly decided to have Han go and rescue him, 4lom was the only one at the dungeon so I deployed han next door moved in and payed 3 to free Luke. I left 2 force forgetting that General solo can&#146;t cancel a destiny at an interior site unless with chewie.  He drops EJP Dengar, EPP Fett and Bane on Luke and Han. bountied both of the and battled. his first action he hidden weapons Luke and draws a 7 so Luke is immediately lost, Miraclously I don&#146;t lose much in the battle but Han is captured and he retrieves lots of force.  I then decide to just forgot about tatooine like a DBO deck should and just concentrate on my drains on Dantooine. Get Ithorians going to boost my drains, and my objective is preventing him from draining for the most part. Han got fed to a Rancor which hurt a bit.  He was no longer dealing damage to me so he sends guys to invade DBO. battles are fairly evenly matched but he managed to capture Crix Madine and Major Panno.  Crix was fed to the Sarlaac and Panno went to the Rancor after a brief stop at the Dungeon.  At one point in the game I had set up a steady drain of 8 but he was retrieving a lot with sarlaac and rancor eating guys.  He managed to lock down a few dantooine sites and flip me and I didn&#146;t last long after that.  Loss by 6.<br>
2(+18)<br>
<br>
Highs: not doing to bad at first attempt at DBO<br>
Lows: Getting three guys eaten, He retrieved about 30 force and didn&#146;t use Scum and Villany.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My BHBM vs Niel&#146;s TIGIH<br>
Niel is second ranked around here, I am in third. He has a very nasty dark deck so I am lucky to be the one playing dark here.  not sure how I was matched up against him seeing as he was undefeated but O well.  Niel was the only undefeated player at our Regional but he placed 5th at it, 2 timed wins and 1 true tie (they had packed up there cards before they found out about the new way to prevent true ties.  I got Lord Vader in my opening hand so I am happy.  My first turn I pull D*2 DB and Deploy Emperor to Endor DB.  He activates 2 force moves Luke over and says go.  I drain, deploy Vader, transfer Luke. and say go.  He activates four drops back door and draws it all up.  I deploy Janus to emperor, Sarkli and 4lom to chief chirpa&#146;s hit and move vader to back door.  Niel activates only 4 again, drops Sullust and draws up.  I get a drain of 2 at emperor&#146;s site, 2 at Sarkli&#146;s and take the chance and try for 2 at Back Door, but Vader goes missing so Luke is released.  forgetting that since Emperor and Janus are still at Landing Platform, Luke can&#146;t drain for three, I deploy sim to emperor, Iggy to back door and move Janus, 4lom and Sarkli to back door. Luke gets captured, and 4 characters should easily find vader, espicially with the high destiny in this deck.  He deploys kessel and gets General Calrissian in Falcon there.  I go searching for vader, draw vader&#146;s stick and miss. I drain and lose 3 again for our objectives,  He gets General Solo and Daughter at the Back door with my guys.  I feel it is better to find vader then fight them so I try again and pull the stick again, wish I was tracking it because I was sure it was the same one.  I do get zuckuss and a Lateral Damage to take out Lando, and get my first card. Lose yet another 3 force.  Next turn i finally rescue Vader and Luke is quickly grabbed by him.  He deployed Epp Obi and Corporal Midge to join Han and Leia and stuck around to block my drain.  My turn Vader gets his saber, Deploy Tarkin, and then I circle Obi, Han, Liea and Midge left.  Drop First strike, battle, he misses with fallen portal in tarkin, Iggy captures Han, Vader chops up Daughter, I cancel his battle destiny and He loses the battle by 17, and stacks a card.  There was a bit more battling in space but he didn&#146;t do any damage to me and the game quickly ends. just never got around to get Emperor to the throne room to set up emperor&#146;s power, he drained at the Endor DB the entire game.  I hit him for some fast drains while I force choked him, which killed alot of his forces. by the time he had the force to do stuff I was to well set up.<br>
Win by 16.<br>
4(+28)<br>
<br>
Highs: Force choking him so well to start and duelling obi.<br>
Lows: drawing vader&#146;s stick twice to find vader which cost me lots of force, not realizing till I wrote this article that I shouldn&#146;t have gone to pick up Luke.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My DBO vs Ian&#146;s RalOps<br>
Ian&#146;s rating isn&#146;t as high as a lot of ther players around here only because he is the main TD around here. He may actually be the best player though.  He first turn pulls Executor DB and puts an At-St pilot there and drops a couple of sites to raltiir. My first turn I pull my generals. Get Home one DB and deploy Crix and brukman there. He has a bad draw with no other characters. He drops an at-st to Executor DB and deploys another site, DB and Gall with MP. I go activate pull a site deploy Spaceport DB in hand and pull hoth DB and flip DBO second turn. I also deploy Craken in Tala 1 and fly over to Raltiir.  He Deploys Vader&#146;s Personal Shuttle, Vader and Dengar in punishing one to Raltiir, I barrier Dengar. He battles, I draw a 6 he draws a 1, I am immune he has to lose Vader. M6y turn I drain for 3 back craken up with blout in tala 2 and battle, I have to lose blout he loses vader&#146;s shuttle.  He retaliates with Boosk in Hounds tooth and Boba Fett In Slave 1, He draws low, I lose everything plus 1 and he loses dengar.  I star getting Ithorians to my sites to boost my drains. He flips his objective. I am getting a drain of 2 because of my Ithorians he is getting a drain of 2 because of Mara&#146;s stick and Boba fett at Dantooine.  I got the draining going several turns sooner though so I will win this race.  I manage to get Jedi Luke with stick to clear one of his sites and he drew a 6 total for destiny so Luke barely stays.  I now got a drain of 3 set up. He tries to have the emperor start overseeing it personally on raltiir so I am afraid.  I have menace fades in hand but it will take a couple turns to deploy falcon and artoo in red 5 to dantooine and get lando, nien nunb and Chewie to Gall to set it up.  Luckily while I was drawing I realized I had a sense and an alter in my hand and hence went and altered Overseeing it personally which he had no response to.  I deployed EPP Han to Luke and together they felt like chasing after an emperor.  Get to Emperor, and get chewien and mini falcon to gall. He drops Lord Vader with Saber to back up Emperor and tries to You Are Beaten Luke out. Luckily that sense I had earlier came in handy and stopped that. No easy win for him today. He battles chops up Luke, I draw only 5 total for BD so he is immune and I end up losing both but nothing more. He eventually gets Bossk and Boba Fett to Gall to prevent me from controlling ti for Menace Fades, so that he can get drains going again with his Lightsabers.  I manage to wipe one of them out in a battle but lose chewie and artoo in red 5. Calrissian in falcon ended up running away from fett to raltiir. Jedi Luke dropped down on a at-st pilot in a at-st. play an insertion planning in the battle, but he still adds just enough to beat Luke&#146;s Immunity, If Luke had a stick he wouldn&#146;t have. I managed to clear a site long enough to flip him for a turn, but he flipped back on his turn so I couldn&#146;t get full drains in. The destiny 6 insertion planning I played for Luke,was now being tracked. I had Beezer and greeves in hand and a 6 on top so I felt I should hit somone, mara was alone at a site and vader was alone at a site, I ended up going after mara because she had less power and her site offered me a drain bonus for my scouts, But if I would have realized Mara would hit one with a stick and attrition the other I would have realized I should go after Vader because he was at the DB and I could easily bring reinforcements over to flip him.  I played my insertion planning drew my 6 and we both ended up losing everything.  He wasrunning low on force so he had to leave the site empty, next turn Orrimaarko came down ther and flipped him. He again managed to flip back but it was costing him force which he didn&#146;t really have enough of anymore.  I was starting to run low as well and I wasn&#146;t sure If I was going to win it. The game pretty much came down to me tracking one destiny 6 and having it pop pretty much every single battle. in the end I managed to drain him out. Win by 6<br>
6(+34)<br>
<br>
Highs: Beating Raltiir even though DBO is suppose to be crap and raltiir gains so much more on the flip side.<br>
Lows: The game was very stressful :)<br>
<br>
In the end I believe I got second place. not to bad of a showing for DBO. Wish we got our normal 6 games in so I could play with DBO a bit more. It was an enjoyable tourney, It was free and we haven&#146;t gotten prize support from decipher for a while so no prizes unfortanetely, O well, Hopefully my rating improves.  <br>
