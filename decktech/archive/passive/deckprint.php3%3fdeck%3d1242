strenghts : against all other decks<br>
<br>
The key in this deck is to go battle your opponent away as soon as your objective is flipped.<br>
If they get to Raltiir before you flip, don't panic.  Be patient, avoid them, at one point you will be<br>
able to flip the objective.  The only time this deck loses besides when playing to<br>
operatives, is when <br>
it doesn't get it's force activation going.<br>
<br>
You can win from operatives, but it's very hard.  You can nullify their drains with bright center and the -1 from the<br>
objective.<br>
<br>
only 2 vaders in the deck.  When you flip, get him for 2 force.  If he get's battled away, use evader to save him<br>
and get him for 2 force again.<br>
<br>
start oppressive enforcement or bad feeling have I.<br>
Bad feeling against beatdown, oppressive enforcement is great against<br>
SAC.  The only alterable effect is Bad Feeling Have I.  When they sense something,<br>
stack it and alter the sense.  Your alters get back in your used pile due to oppressive enforcement,<br>
their senses get stacked.  Near the end of the game, you should be able to alter<br>
stuff of them.<br>
<br>
- against numbers.  plop a scout walker with an AT-ST pilot (destiny 3) at 3 sites.<br>
  Flip, get vesden and deploy him to the docking bay and hide him in a walker.<br>
  That effectively gives you a total destiny of 15 on table which could end up hurting the numbers player.<br>
- against beatdown.  Be careful.  Start bad feeling have I, which makes their EPP's deploy +4 on Raltiiir.<br>
  deploy walkers to Raltiir and flip.  keep an alter ready for whatever nasty effects their playing (<br>
  mechanical failure, frozen assets, beggar, ..)<br>
- against Hidden Base.  Flip your objective, get security precautions, get ships<br>
  and start probing their planets one by one.  I've never lost to a HB deck.<br>
- against MWVL.  You're safe from the 2nd jedi test because of the AT-ST pilots. (they draw destiny if not able to otherwise)<br>
  when they test all the way, it's necessary you invade dabobah.  Get Kashyyk from reserve, Bossk in hounds tooth, Vader and whatever you feel like.<br>
- against a mains deck that starts Obi's hut/toshi station or Yavin4 throne room/...<br>
  you certainly need the imperial arrest order quick to prevent them from nabruning over.  In most cases imperial arrest order is a good<br>
  card to deploy early.  When you flipped the objective, you should be fine and start battling them.<br>
<br>
keep in mind you can get any card from reserve for 2 force, so combo's are not that hard to set up, and you usually add +3 to your total battle destiny.<br>
<br>
have fun with it.<br>
