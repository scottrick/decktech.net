<br>
Pre-tourney:<br>
I wake up at 7:30, get ready because I have things to do, and places to go before the tourney. I grab the entry fee and my cards and I am off. My decks are QMC, and Endor OPS (visit my site if you want to see them, but I did some last minute changes, so they wont be completely accurate.) I get done with the things I have to do, it is about 12:30 the tourney starts at 1:00. I grab a quick bite at a fast food place all the while going over my decks trying to improve them. I arrive at the tourney, my decks primed, prepped, and ready to play. People start showing up late, so we wait to start for about ten minutes, we have about 23 people. We start, but another one shows up.<br>
<br>
Game one:<br>
My Endor Ops vs.&#146;Travis&#146; deck, which is sorta blow up the bunker, but without the objective or any thing like that, instead he starts with sullest<br>
We shuffle, go through the routine, ect, all the while I notice his three effects that he used with Heading for the medical frigate can not be used, (they were launching the @#$%ault, haven, and traffic control, if you were wondering) anyway, he starts without any effects or starting interrupt, I draw my hand, and it was perfect for the game, the only thing I needed to flip was 3 cards, one of which was an effect I could get from my reserve deck, a star destroyer or two, a pilot, and a bunch of good stuff. I use my objective to find ominous rumors, and draw my force pile. First turn he gets just enough to deploy Redemption, and he drops a few clouds its my turn, I do not yet have enough force to deploy the Executor, so I wait, but I drop a site and a few walkers to endor, I control the docking bay, and due to mobilization points that gives me extra force, I end up saving 2 force, his turn, he didn&#146;t even force drain he just deployed another cloud sector and drawed my turn, I activate, force drain, I deploy the conquest with a pilot that adds 3 to power and Bossk in hounds tooth to sullest where a lone redemption awaits a beatdown. But first I deploy ominous rumors, I beat the lone redemption into the ground, he loses 8 force from his reserve deck plus redemption. I draw the two cards in my force pile. He is doing 0 damage a turn; he starts drawing like crazy looking for his endor sites. My turn, I drain for 6 and I deploy the last site needed to flip and do so. But first I deploy a star destroyer with two pilots on it to endor. I leave force in my force pile. His turn, he deploys a nueblion b frigate to sullest and gold squadron one with Chewie of k@#$%hyyyk aboard. He draws, my turn I activate, drain for now 8 and drop Executor and a cheap star destroyer down to sullest and battle, he only has 3 ability and I am drawing two destiny. He loses everything there and 3 force from hand. I move a star destroyer over to endor with my one remaining force. His turn, he deploys wars not make one great on a cloud sector, making draining expensive. He draws. I activate, drain for 14, and I don&#146;t even have my systems out. I deploy a star destroyer for no reason but to fortify my sites. And he goes. He finally got an endor site; it was rebel landing site. He deployed it, getting around perimeter patrol was now easy. But I had a firm grip on endor. He has a large group at endor, I would never think of battling, so after my force drains, I did the next best thing, I put U-3PO down at the only site he controlled or even occupied for that matter. He was back to doing 0 damage a turn. He moved his guys during a subsequent turn and I moved my spy. Then basically it was my turn and I force drained for the win.<br>
<br>
Score: 2(+26)<br>
<br>
Game 2: My QMC vs. &#146;Adam&#146;s&#146; big blue<br>
This was quick, I will just cut to the big battle, it was about 3 turns in, he had nothing on table, and I had already started my regular routine of controlling. And draining. I had Gen. Calrissian in the falcon with the spiral at the bespin system, I was thinking of waiting for more protection, but a power of 11 seems enough on turn 3 right? Wrong. He dropped thunderflare, a few of the sabers with the pilots, and one of those Sfs tie cannons that if you use 3 force it adds 3 and is lost if hit. I bet most of you see where this is going, so I will cut to the chase. He battled hit the falcon, it was lost, and he overpowered the spiral by about 10-15. From there on in I was just committing suicide, afterall I had lost all of my good cards, and my retrieval. We battled for fun here and there, but I managed to wear him down by about fifteen force. He ended up winning by 31! That was a wake up call for me sense I had been placing 3rd or higher in the previous tourneys. I will never go without so little protection again.<br>
<br>
Current score: 2(-5)<br>
<br>
Game 3: My QMC deck vs. &#146;Travis&#146;&#146; (yes him again) DSII/ endor ops deck.<br>
This was a long game, I had nothing to do at bespin, or any of the cloud city sites, I just battled him the whole time, His First turn, he put a biker scout alone at a site, this was a mistake, he deployed the DSII and other stuff like Perimeter patrol, and moff jerjerrod using things like Operational as planned, he basically just deployed a bunch of characters, one at every site, for me to beat on. He drew. My turn, I activate, quite a bit, he deployed 3 sites, and I get out Gen. Calrissian in the falcon using Strike planning and Squadron a ssignments. I deployed them to endor system, I put close air support out, I had the Blount/Tala 2 pair in my hand, I deployed that, and I dropped a few alien scouts at one of his sites, I only had a power of three but that was enhanced by close air support and two tracked destinies. I beat the lone biker for the loss of the biker and about 8 force. It was all space battles from there on in, all with the same outcome.  Me winning.<br>
He left the DSII unprotected, so I got a drain of 5 there, and 2 on the ground. I lost by 4 He pulled off a heavy drain at last minute.<br>
<br>
Current score: 2 (-9)<br>
<br>
Game 4: My Endor Ops, Vs. some there is good in him deck, It was hard though<br>
This was the most boring game in the tourney, we both got killer hands, we both drained for more than we expected, we both had our great moments in battle. Ect. Basically it came down to a drain race; he got an edge with the objective flipped. But long story short, I won by 14 one reason I won was This guy did not know how to play the game, He force drained before he activated, and moved before he battled, he was pretty pissed by the end of the game, but I think he learned a few things about the game.<br>
<br>
Final Score: 4 (+5) <br>
<br>
I didn&#146;t get so good in the ranking, like 3 to last or something, we had a lot of big winners today and some people&#146;s differential ended up to be like 100+ or something. Thanks for reviewing my first tourney report, and have a nice day.  <br>
