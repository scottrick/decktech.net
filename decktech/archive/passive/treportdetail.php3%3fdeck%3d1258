<br>
The Prelude<br>
<br>
<br>
Following the tourney I played at Modesto on Saturday, I was pretty wasted by the time I hit Kevin Shannons place. I walk in, meet and greet his folks and commence sharing war stories in Kevins kitchen. We go a few more rounds at Raw Deal and Triple H still owns Austin, and Steve gives up and calls it a night for Raw Deal.<br>
<br>
We call up and order pizza, and after about 20 minutes of Kevin scaring the guy on the phone and us finally deciding what we want, we tell the guy and he says &quot;Ok, should be over soon&quot;. So we wait.......starve.......wait........and starve for a few hours when one of us realizes the pizza aint coming. Dont you love pizza places? <br>
<br>
Luckily Kev has some leftover pizza and we get over on that for the night and turn in. After talking to Kevin for awhile, I decide to call it a night, but cant get a wink of sleep thanks to Steve&#146;s MONTROUS SNORING(sleep next to a lawnmower on high and you MIGHT be where I was at Kev&#146;s place).....and wake up in what feels like 5 minutes of sleep to that blasted Grandma clock on Kev&#146;s wall, I go to the tourney on literally 2 hours of ZZZ&#146;s. <br>
<br>
My 2 decks the night before were the only cards I had on me, so I moded Stimmed Jim&#146;s EBO and my BHBM and went into action, no gas, but I have some fumes, which are good enough for now. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Game<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS BHBM vs. Caleb Jones LS EBO X-wing/Speeder Smackdown<br>
<br>
I met Caleb back at the DSII Prerelease, and hes a pretty decent player from what Ive heard. I get Emporer to the Endor Dbay(its back) and Rendili first turn for huge activation and early drains. I draw for Vader and force Luke out, but he waits on it and starts losing major force to Your Destiny. He draws like mad for aliens to set up EBO, but I keep him in check with Monnok, slowing him. Im draining for 4 a turn at the 2 dbays and I start dropping ships to Hoth. He comes at me with 7 X-wings and battles, but a few quick destinies later, I wipe out all but 2. The remaining proceeds to get smacked, with Red Leader getting Lateraled and him getting smacked for about 15 more for the game. Win by 35.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+35)<br>
Highs: Off to a good start again<br>
Lows: Beating him probaly worse than hes been beaten before in his life....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Robert Selbys DS Hunt Down Hell<br>
<br>
Robs a fellow trash-talker and I love showing him the ropes......unfortunately, he has this game locked......I get the slower start as he grabs docking bays from his Reserve. He started Decree and sends Vader to Hoth and Miyoom to follow. Hes activating for hell and I cant draw past Miyoom, so im ready to lose when.......he skips her ability. So I drop EPP Obi to Vader and battle, miss Vader, he misses Obi, and I draw a 4 to kill Vader while he draws low even with I Have You Now to only cost me a 1 force loss. He drops another Vader, and I try and mount a final assault for major loss. I activate and leave 4 destinies.....I check them with Secret Base.....5,5,7,and 6.......he cuts the shuffle and I drop EPP Leia, followed by Capn Han, and Farmboy, when he automatically plays Vaders Obsession. I draw a 5 and the 7, he draws a 3 and a 6, to LOSE THE DUEL TO LUKE BY 1. I proceed to battle and smash Tarkin and Miyoom, drop Honor to make Honor LS friendly, and get Red Leader to space to drain him out. Win by 12.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 4(+47)<br>
Highs: Lucking out and him making that mistake of dueling Luke despite the high destinies he knew was there. <br>
Lows: Nothing much.....<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point, me and Steve decide were hungry and there is talk of a nearby Taco Bell.....so we drive off to find it, only to get lost within the FORTY plazas there. We never find it, and we get back in time to start the 2nd round...<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: DS BHBM vs. Charles Palmer&#146;s LS MWYHL &quot;I train Luke&quot;<br>
<br>
This game over from the start. I get the early jump with Rendili and the Dbays fast and Emperor first turn. He looks for his sites and tests but ends up activating some key stuff and is forced to draw for them. Im draining and trying to force out Luke with Vader. His turn, he drops Test 1 to Yoda, and LUKE as the apprentice. Wow.....havent seen this in awhile......3 a turn for the rest of the game.  Im doing about 6 a turn to him, and drop Search and Destroy, and its game.....he eventually gets Luke out to Emporer, but Sim and Palpy draw enough to kill the Young Fool and thats all I got to say about that. Win by 36.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 6(+83)<br>
Highs: SMASHING MYWHL, training Luke or not......I HATE THAT DECK.....so slow.....<br>
Lows: Well it was sad that he forgot to include Honor in his deck, although its been satisfied already.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Dan Mochizuki&#146;s ISB(watch out, kids!)<br>
<br>
Well its Dan.....does his DS ever change? I get EBO set up pretty quickly.....he cant find BGs in his deck outside of the DBays, so I get the early ups. I set up Han in Falcon to Kiffex, and show him my destiny and Han doesnt budge for the remainder of game. He tries and get Decree going, and manages to do so alot of the game, with I have Luke, Leia, and Melas &quot;chillin like a villian&quot; on Hoth, chasing him. He wont battle, and while Obi is busy on Endor knocking off Imps, Im looking for OTE with my Ishi Tibs. I eventually find it, and its over.....I chase him around with Luke and Leia on Hoth, and he has Fett in space for the Falcon to go work over. He loses 3 over the next few turns, but still manages to get out new BGs and start draining. Were both taking alot, but thanks to my Baragwins, I edge Dan out barely.........Win by 2.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 8(+85)<br>
Highs: Another great game with Dan, the only pimp on the block.....<br>
Lows: Nothing much....<br>
<br>
<br>
Me and Steve take off after Game 3 to find the elusive Taco Bell(which btw, we still dont have a clue where &quot;ITS RIGHT THERE&quot; is......), and to no avail, but we find Nations, which has the best burgers in Cali(THE BEST BURGERS IN CALI....trust me....), and chow down and get back late for the 4th game.....everyones a little wasted at this point, just want to end it and head home....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5: DS BHBM vs. Kevin Shannon&#146;s LS Lewis-style Speeder Smackdown<br>
<br>
This is the type of deck Id think my deck cant handle, NOT MWYHL......but even that proved wrong. I force Luke out early and keep things tight with Vader, Emporer and Sim together. He moves Luke out, and grabs Dbays. I bring Luke home and start dueling. Sim helps me win over half the duels, and I send Veers on Blizzard to Hoth for some drains. He Mech Failures, and drops 10 speeders to Veers, and beats down. I play Command, and after a long dispute, I get Power to work and he loses a crapload of Speeders and I lose only a few. Im winning my duels and hitting him in space.....he didnt have Xwings in there so hes not shooting up there. Hes trying to get drains going, but he doesnt want to spread too thin, so I send another Walker at him and duke it out a few turns. It comes down to him wiping out a multitude of my guys, and me losing way too much to my Objective. So when he gets down to a few force, I pick Vader up via Rise, My Friend.....sending Luke to his hand. He doesnt want to redeploy him, but if he doesnt, he loses 3.......he takes that damage twice, and Vader is killing Speeders off on Hoth. He gets alot stacked to I Feel the Conflict, but he cant afford Luke to Hoth, so he drops to Endor just to stop damage, and Emporer and Sim hold off some Speeders and I get in drains where Vader is for the game.......Win by only 8.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 10(+93)<br>
Highs: Playing Kevin and having another good one with him<br>
Lows: Nothing much....<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point, Im the only undefeated, Feldman and Steve are both 5-1 and creeping up. The tourneys mine if I can win the final game, but its with LS, which is always etchy. I pray I dont play Kevin, and I do, of course, and face his Speed Hunt Down.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Kevin Shannons DS HDown Speed<br>
<br>
Same story as last time.....only my mind was actually here. I lose alot early to Visage, and I actually manage to get in a few drains this time. I have nothing to slow him as he sets up Emperor with Overseeing It on Endor. I lose 2 Obis off the top to Visage, and see no end to the pain, and I just die out to the pain. Loss by 28.<br>
<br>
FINAL Score: 10(+65)<br>
Highs: Seeing how much LS sucks, but Decipher thinks its BALANCED.....<br>
Lows: Did you read those games?<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, as fate would have it, I get screwed AGAIN.....I get 3rd place instead of the win, because Steves MWYHL and Feldmans HB ends up winning by huge sums........I get jacked in prize support, and thats it......so after a weekend of intense SW, what do I learn?<br>
<br>
#1.) LS Sucks.......dont matter what you guys say, ITS TRUE.....ITS TRUE<br>
#2.) BHBM is a man-eater.......girls have no fear for it......29-0 vs. guys.....0-1 vs girls....<br>
#3.) Triple H owns Stone Cold........<br>
 <br>
and finally.....<br>
<br>
Im sorry, Ive got to say that LS SUCKS........ok, back to the last thing I learned......<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.....<br>
<br>
LS SUCKS.<br>
<br>
And thats the bottom line....<br>
