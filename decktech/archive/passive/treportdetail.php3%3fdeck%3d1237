<br>
# of Players : 8 ( Sanctioned )<br>
TD : Richard Davis<br>
<br>
Decks : <br>
LS - Scout Craze w/ Good Objective. Lots of guys<br>
DS - Anti-Profit.<br>
<br>
Game 1 : My LS vs. Philip Vasquez&#146;s BHBM (1500s)<br>
<br>
	I get my stuff set up right away and drain him with<br>
Super Luke for a lot.  I beat him up once at his Docking Bay <br>
and stack 2 cards on my objective. He deploys Lots of TIEs<br>
up to Mon Calamari but doesn&#146;t have SFSystems or much. He<br>
had like 3 Emperors and 3 Lord Vaders but didn&#146;t really <br>
matter. I win handily by 27. Record : 2 (+27)<br>
<br>
High : Winning<br>
Lows : nothing<br>
<br>
Game 2 : My DS vs. Jeff Alexander&#146;s Good Objective (1700s)<br>
<br>
	Hmm. I get my Tatooine stuff and draw like crazy.<br>
I&#146;ve got like a 20 card hand and he&#146;s got lots of space stuff<br>
so I&#146;m drawing a lot to figure out what I&#146;m gonna do. Vader<br>
and Stick are holding Luke at his Endor Docking Bay and<br>
Boelo is in the Chamber while I&#146;m using Search and Destroy<br>
to do my damage. Battle Order is slowing the game down which<br>
is a bonus in my favor I think. He gets out Boussh and drops<br>
a pilot down to fulfill Search and Destroy. I drop Mara and<br>
Evazan and I chase him around for basically the rest of the<br>
game. He deploys Kessel and move Home One over to Kessel<br>
leaving two matching pilots to hold Tatooine. I deploy <br>
IG-2000w/ IG and Fett in Ride and draw a 9 destiny to get<br>
rid of Home One and retrieve/lose with First Strike. So now<br>
I get free drains. Obi-Wan comes down to run around with<br>
Boussh and finally they stand up and are force to fight so<br>
I operate on Boussh ( I remembered the +1 from Oppressive<br>
Enforcement for Executor and that was the difference ) use<br>
4-LOM to cancel Ben&#146;s immunity and Ben&#146;s gone. Search and<br>
Destroy and that&#146;s pretty much game. Win by 12 I think.<br>
Record : 4 ( +39 )<br>
<br>
Highs : Winning when I had some mistakes , not losing a <br>
battle.<br>
Lows : Having to draw a gazillion.<br>
<br>
Game 3 : My LS vs. David Irvine&#146;s Scum deck (2000s)<br>
<br>
	I get setup again and hit him with Super Luke Drains.<br>
I send Harc seff and people over to Jabba&#146;s Palace to seal a<br>
drain or two. Stack a card here and there and the drains were<br>
what really killed him. Win by 18. 6 ( +57 ) <br>
<br>
Highs : I think this is the first time I&#146;ve beaten David.<br>
Lows : IG-88 captured EPP Leia , IG is annoying.<br>
<br>
Game 4 : My DS v. Andrew Wise&#146;s Profit Deck (1700s)<br>
<br>
	Well my Deck is Anti-Profit and his is Profit<br>
so you probably figure out what is gonna happen. I get<br>
everything running pretty smooth and its brutal for him.<br>
I think the worst part was Choke Vader w/ Stick versus<br>
Geezum and Crix Madine. I choke Geezum which is expected<br>
but I go to hit Madine and he plays Dodge. For those that<br>
don&#146;t know Dodge subtracts 3 from every weapon destiny so<br>
my total weapon destiny is -6 and Crix is value of 3 so<br>
I need a 10 to hit him and I get it so he loses like Crix<br>
and 8 and then later Vader crushes and Arcona for 6-7<br>
more. I also had Occupation and Search and Destroy up,<br>
Honor of the Jedi saved him lots of Force as did ICBWorse<br>
but the damage was pooring in from everywhere. Win by 32.<br>
Record : 8 ( +89 )<br>
<br>
Highs : Win the tournament. First tournament after Dagobah<br>
Regionals and I did okay.<br>
Lows : Really destroying Wise. <br>
<br>
I&#146;m sorry this is such a small TReport but it just kinda <br>
seems like a blur so I&#146;ll go with some Tournament Observations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tournament Observations : <br>
-Decktech seems to have a strong influence , little kids had<br>
really good decks they just needed to learn how to play them.<br>
-Dodge is insanely good.<br>
-Profit needs force.<br>
-Lots of characters is the way to go.<br>
