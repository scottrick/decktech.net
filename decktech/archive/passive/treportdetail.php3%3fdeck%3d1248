What has really sucked about the last few tourneys is my Light deck keeps me from doing better.  My Light this time was an almost exact copy of Martin Akesson&#146;s The Celebration deck, with a couple changes like Honor.  I was feeling pretty confident.  I borrowed to Tunnel Visions and a Higher Ground from some of my friends that went too.  I tweaked my RallOps a little by dropping Executor for Rendili, and some crap for Nemet to stop Spiral.  OK, my deck is teched out for maximum beatdown ability. Here&#146;s my deck as it stood on Saturday:<br>

Higher Ground is cool.  If you don&#146;t know why it&#146;s really tech against RallOps.  If you still don&#146;t get it, your a dumbass, stop reading now.<br>
<br>
OK, anyway, me and my friend Rob show up at the tourney a freaking hour early because his mom overestimated how long it was going to take.  I can&#146;t say anything though cuz my mom did the same thing first time here.  So we get there, Skee (the TD) is unpacking stuff, so we help him carry stuff from his car.  We trade some stuff he needs for sets and some more people show up.  Then Mike Merletto shows up with his ghetto @#$% shoelaces, and we laugh.  He&#146;s wearing an Umpa-Lumpa T-shirt from Willy Wonka, and we laugh about that some more.  Then some more people show up, including Adam Weinstein, Patrick Hines, and Ivan Kanner.  I think Ivan&#146;s got his midlife crisis mojo workin&#146;, cuz he has a hat on backwards and sunglasses, so I think he was trying to look young again.  Ivan, if you see this, I&#146;m just kidding :D.  We wait around for a while, and we end up with 10 players.  Skee announces pairings for the first round.<br>
<br>
GAME 1: My Dark  versus Henry Jicha&#146;s LS Profit<br>
<br>
I barely beat this deck last time I played Henry, so I didn&#146;t really know what to expect.  I started my stuff and he started his stuff.  He dropped Ben to the AC first turn, and flipped.  Ouch.  I dropped a couple scrubs to my docking bays for force generation, and flipped 2nd turn as always.  I fortified my locations on Ralltiir, set up drains, then dropped Chimaera with Evax piloting to his Tatooine, occupied by GLiG1.  I smack that and a few from his hand.  Then he drops some other ship, but I&#146;m immune and adding 2, so he loses oen of the pilots.  I respond next turn with Bossk In Bus, and Saber 1 with Baron.  3 destinies baby :D.  I cream the stuff there, and hit him for a few.  He&#146;s not draining, but hitting me for 2 a turn from OBD.  He&#146;s got Han, Chewie, EPP Leia, and a scrub scout at JP, and Ben, Lando, and another scrub scout at AC.  OK, that sucks, so I try to stop it with Lord Vader w/ stick and Mara.  I couldn&#146;t find her saber :(.  I swing at Ben, hit him, and clear the site except for Lando, and I lose Mara.  Next turn, he drops some more scrub guys and Tawss, battles, I swing and hit whoever&#146;s there, and I&#146;m immune.  In the meantime, he&#146;s dropping Kiffex and Kessel for more force generation, while I&#146;m draining at Rendili, Tatooine, and 2 Ralltiir sites, since he Projectioned the Spaceport Docking Bay.  He&#146;s down to about 10 force, me about 16.  He tries a last ditch drain at Kiffex, but I smack that with Saber 2, Saber 4, and Devestator.  He had Defiance and some stuff, so no overflow.  That set up yet another drain of 2, and that becomes too much for him, and I take the victory.<br>
<br>
FW (+12)<br>
Total: 2 (+12)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning,  getting my Saber 1 and Bossk combo going, and not having to play Adam first game =).<br>
<br>
Lows: Having Projection reduce my drain, and getting hit for 2 Profit damage despite my efforts to invade Tatooine.<br>
<br>
After this game, I learn Rob beats Adam by 27.  All I can say is, wow.  We&#146;re talking about a 1480 player beating an 1800+ player here.  Great stuff.  Nice win Rob.<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 2:  My Light versus Jason Hairston&#146;s DS Court Stuff.<br>
<br>
This game was no fun at all for me.  I started with a bunch of crap, no aliens.  I pulled my sites and dropped some stuff to the system.  He used Court to pull Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, then dropped 4-LOM with Concussion on it, the dropped Bossk with him.  Good thing I had I&#146;ll Take The Leader to make it power -2.  He loses Bossk, I lose Blount in Tala 1 because of his 2 destinies.  I never can find my mains, or any of my Tunnel Visions, so I never really get set up strongly to set up Tatooine Celebration.  He is draining for 3 at Audience Chamber because of a first turn Mara, Saber, and Presence.  I get Jedi, Ackbar, and Harc down to Pit to reduce his drain, but he battles with CC Fett and a bunch of stuff and kills off Ackbar and Harc, and captures Luke, then goes to the Dungeon and retrieves all of his lost pile.  I put up a fight with Chewie, Tawss, and some guys, but Tawss is battled away, and next turn he puts a Bounty on Chewie and grabs him, retrieving what little I had drained him for.  The rest of the game consists of his drains and my futile attempts to slow them.  <br>
<br>
FL (-35)<br>
Total: 2(-23)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Losing by such a freaking huge amount,  effectively killing my chances to win.  <br>
<br>
Highs: Not a whole lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3:  My LS versus Michael Li&#146;s Court w/ Star Destroyers<br>
<br>
Very weird game.  I got my sites out, pulled a Fallen Portal in my opening hand, and dropped GS1 with Lando to Tatooine first turn.  Next turn, I dropped Wedge In Ship and Spiral there.  He responded with Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, and Chimaera piloted by some scrub guy.  I won by a bit, he loses the scrub.  I drop Jedi Luke, Tawss, and EPP Leia to Spaceport Docking Bay, and they stay untouched for the rest of the game, steadily draining for 2.  A couple turns later, I Signal for Celebration, Tunnel Vision for Obi, and drop some mains to Tatooine DB, where they also stay for the rest of the game.  I played Celebration, where I would retreive 2 a turn for about 8 turns.  Every turn, he would drop a Star Destroyer to Tatooine, and battle there.  He would lose it, but I would be down on power and have to forfeit something to cover.  I canceled his destiny with Wedge about 6 times out of about 8 battles.  Eventually he beat me off Tatooine to cancel Celeb, but it was too late.  Obi and gang were draining for 3 at DB, and 2 at the other.  So he lays down CC Fett, and a foil Vader (wow) to guess what, Farm.  he chickened out :D.  I Projectioned that mess, and kept draining him till he was dead.<br>
<br>
FW (+9)<br>
Total: 4 (-6)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning, getting Celebration going, and not having him touch my guys on the ground at all.<br>
<br>
Lows:  Not winning by much, and being beated off Tatooine, which really sucks and should never happen with my deck.<br>
<br>
So after this game, I have 20 minutes to walk down to Taco Bell and grab something to eat.  I walk down, and there&#146;s a big line.  Great.  Took me 5 minutes to walk, and about 10 before I got my food.  So I have 5 minutes to get back, eat, and prepare for Game 4, and it takes 5 minutes to walk back!  So on the way, I eat my 2 soft tacos supreme, lettuce falling out the whole way, and manage to finish as I&#146;m walking in the building door.  I chug the soda down the hall, and walk in to find the games already setting up.  D&#146;oh!<br>
<br>
Game 4:  My DS versus Patrick Hine&#146;s Profit Deck<br>
<br>
This game was fun.  He started his junk, dropped some guys early, but didn&#146;t flip.  I got my stuff set up, dropped DS-181-4 to D*II DB, and generated while getting my beatdown stuff in hand.  Next turn, I drop Tempest 1 with Igar piloting to JP, where that will stay unmatched for most of the game.  I smack some junk at Tatooine, and have control of that.  He puts Boushh to JP, and Momaw with Undercover to Jungle.  Great...  But no worries, I commence my beating of his junk he Nabruned to Ralltiir.  I dropped Lord Vader w/ stick (he is a machine!) and swiped the Han sitting there looking innocent.  He loses everything, and I lose the AT-ST pilot that was there, he flips back.  So I drain for 2 at Tatooine, 2 at Office, and 1 at SPDB for a few turns.  He lays down the Falcon to JP w/ OBD text, drops Cap&#146;n Han, reflips, breaks Boushh&#146;s cover, and battles.  I get crap destinies, so he loses Boushh, and moves Han to be with an Obi draining at AC.  He&#146;s lower on force than me, and I just sit back and drain and see what he does to stop me.  Turns out it was just moving Han over to JP, hopping on the Falcon, and flying up to Tatooine, where he in turn gets beat by my squad.  So he is draining for 1, and me for about 5, so I drain him out.<br>
<br>
FW (+18)<br>
Total: 6(+12)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning and playing Pat, he&#146;s cool.<br>
<br>
Lows: Not much, all around fun game with a nice player.<br>
<br>
OK, so I come in 3rd place, and get 3 CC packs, and a LS SE starter deck.  Pretty crappy prize if you ask me, but I didn&#146;t complain after I pulled a Captain Han.  The winner, Ray Frank, got a 2nd anthology.  I trade with Adam a little bit for some stuff I want, and then my mom shows up and we head out.<br>
<br>
Martin Akesson (I doubt you&#146;ll read this, but oh well):  OK, yeah, I used your deck, but I didn&#146;t have all the cards to play it, so I had to substitute.  Gimme a break, I&#146;m only 1554 :P.<br>
<br>
If anyone is in the area and doesn&#146;t play much, please contact me.  We need at least 12 people next month in order for the 3rd Anthology to be the 1st place prize.  So, that&#146;s about all for now, cya :D.<br>
