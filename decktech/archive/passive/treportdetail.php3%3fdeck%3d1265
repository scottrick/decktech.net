<br>
Hello, this is my first report and only my 3rd tourney. I&amp;#8217;m doing this by memory so the order of the games might be messed up.<br>
<br>
Light side was Profit/Eloms/SAC with Staging Areas and Insurrection for quick activation.<br>
Dark was SYC with really quick activation via IAO and MP with Oniths, I really didn&amp;#8217;t want to play this deck but couldn&amp;#8217;t think of anything else in time.<br>
<br>
Game One<br>
<br>
My dark vs. Dave Patten&amp;#8217;s Test to One/astroid sanctuary squadron assignments<br>
Dave seemed pretty cool, and I had never seen him before so I didn&amp;#8217;t know what to expect.  But his deck had little substance:  just asteroids and a few manuvers, he didin&amp;#8217;t activate enough to escape Onith, and he was never able to find either a matching pilot or ship in his reserve deck, except for Luke in r5, which was on the table the whole game, but I pulled the executor and was able to beet him off big one and cancel his astroid sanctuary.  It was when I was picking up untill I had like 20+ cards and looking through my deck via IAO and soon  realized that I had forgotten ComeHereYBC, which really made me mad. But I finally found my twileck so I could pull Search and Destroy, after that the game went really quick draining at 2 sites with 2 Presence of the Forces, and the Executor at a Field (I was lucky and he never drew a astroid for the executor&amp;#8217;s asteroid draw.    FW by 16<br>
<br>
2(16)<br>
<br>
Game Two<br>
<br>
My Light vs. Dan&amp;#8217;s Hunt Down<br>
<br>
I had never played against hunt down before, but I was able to pull Honor with Insight, and lost to Visage only twice the whole game while he easily lost 12+ force.  His deck never really interfered after killing Han once.  But I got him out again (explained later), and was causing about 6 force loss during my turn then he had to lose 1 during his turn and he wasn&amp;#8217;t making me lose anything, at one point he left Tarkin alone at the DS DB, and I came down with EPP Han, EPP Leia and an Elom, missed Tarkin twice, wtf? but he still had to lose 6.  FW by 31<br>
<br>
4(47)<br>
<br>
Game Three<br>
<br>
My Dark vs. Greg Schimit&amp;#8217;s train Luke to 5.<br>
<br>
I was able to get Onith out then I&amp;#8217;d just as soon kiss a wookie Son of Skywalker then kill him next turn with Onith, and that was his only Luke and he didn&amp;#8217;t have DOS, so he was screwed.  Search and destroy never even came out I was able to force drain at my Judland Wastes with a presence of the force and his Obi&amp;#8217;s Hut with a presence of the force also.  so I was draining him for 7 a turn while he chased onith around on the death star, again I regretted not having CHYBC in my deck.  Full win by upper 20s(I had a lot of cards out, and a big hand because once again I was diggin for S+D).<br>
<br>
6(75+ish)<br>
<br>
Game Four<br>
<br>
My Light vs. Issac Lyons Tantooine Beetdown?<br>
<br>
I never really got to see what his deck was about because I dominated tantooine the whole game.  He was playing a new deck and taking forever to play which had kinda made me mad, he had already timed out two games.  It all came down to this one battle where he moved Vader, Mara, Janus, Tarkin, and Bossk with Motar Gun to the audience chamber where I had ben w/ his saber, epp luke, epp han, and some scrub.  I then dropped epp leia, 2 eloms attacked played gift and weapon levitated mara&amp;#8217;s stick, so he only had bossk&amp;#8217;s gun which he forgot to fire.  I didn&amp;#8217;t have enough cards in my reserve deck to draw all the destinies I needed but ended up hitting every one but Janus, and 15 force loss spilled over, while I had to lose no one because of Ben, then I just spread out and drained, the game was real quick.  Full win mid 20s.<br>
<br>
8(105ish)<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
<br>
My Light against Dave Pattens Tie Swarm/Kuat Drive Yards<br>
<br>
Dave plays like the opposite of everyone else: no ground all sky, so he never contested my ground forces and I was able to sit back drain and let profit take care of the rest.  I got to alter his Dreaded imperial star fleet and landing claw his Dreadnaught at Sullust, he eventually came down with Godhert and canceled it and I just remembered that he can only do that on Star destroyers, oh well.  Siennar fleets never hit the table, and really the only low of this game was Short Range Fighters which allowed him to retrieve 8.  FW 15.<br>
<br>
10(120ish)<br>
<br>
My Dark vs. Isaac&amp;#8217;s TIGIH<br>
<br>
Well Isaac had his revenge I played really stupid and got bad draws and he played well.  He had Uncontrollable Furied Vader and when I went to canceled it with You Are Beaten he sensed it, then he disarmed Vader, so I really wanted him to die cause I had another one in my hand, but by then Luke was already captured and if I had lost Vader Luke would go to one of my scrub Imps. and by then I didn&amp;#8217;t have enough force to deploy him because of frozen assets and goo nee tay which also stopped Onith, so I was screwed, I never was able to challenge his forces, he just totally dominated. I start Oppressive enforcement and I forgot all the things he sensed should have gone to my used pile, oh well, but it would probably have made no difference.  FL 22<br>
<br>
So I Finished 5-1 10(100ish) which was good enough for first, and pulled a bunch of bunk in my packs, but that&amp;#8217;s not really surprising.  Earlier I had bought an EPP Han pack and pulled both Vader and Tarkin so that made up for the rest.<br>
<br>
Note: Better people better start coming to this tournament because its way to easy.  So next month please come.<br>
