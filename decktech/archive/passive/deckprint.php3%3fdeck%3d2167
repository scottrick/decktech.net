<br>
First off locations:<br>
<br>
There are 11, if you want more then that go play hidden base.  This is not a drop and drain deck, drop and drain decks are weak, a bad draw with no ghhk and a good draw for them with leia, han with weapons and the game is over before it starts.  Battle lose 15 to battle damage.  I will do my best not to lose stupidly to luck.  But with an assured dungeon, and 2 jabba palace, 2 AC you should get a bunch of sites down quickly anyway.  I often have a drain of 6 on turn 3.  The dungeon rules allowing you to retrieve awhole lot of force with your bounty hunters and making tatootine an even more unkind place for the light side to come.  And on the happy day that someone revolutions it you can spend your day capturing characters putting them in the dungeon and releasing them to battle for HUGE battle damage.<br>
<br>
Next: Characters<br>
<br>
Not alot here, the new bounty hunters are deadly, and remove alot of need for extra ORS.  WIth jabba at the AC all the ORS are foreit 5 and thats enough to suck damage away from the bounty hunters.  Chall bekan rocks for the simple reason he is 2 ISB agents in one and reduces deploy cost, with scum, chall and jabba at the AC you can dump your hand in a sec, with all aliens deploy reduced by 3.<br>
<br>
Next: Ships and Vechiles<br>
<br>
Ok, you grab the mist hunter, zuckuss and the dungeon first turn so mist hunter is in there for that.  The school bus is a given.  And then theres Jabbas space cruiser... oh god do i love this ship.  I've heard a lot of talk about the 'SUPER' falcon 3 destinys immmune>5.  OK jabba cruiser, can fairly easily get to 4 battle destiny and COMPLETELY immune to attrition.  With no worry of a lateral damage.  This ship alone can take on all space decks.  Through in the bus, 5 destiny.... i feel for the super falcon.  OK the walkers, the biggest problem for this deck up till recently has been EPP beatdown squads, coming in clashing this guy, cutting down 3 others and pulling 4 destiny.  Losing the guys by themselves is not a worry, cards off the deck from battle damage is.  There foreit of 5 should deal with all but the most deadly beatdown.  Having them in walkers serves 2 purposes.  First they can't be targeted by weapons, and secondly scramble does not effect them.  considering the amount of pilots in the deck, its nice to have the option of still getting a destiny.  Both tempest 1 and 2 react and neither has permenant pilots allowing scum to work with no interference.<br>
Blizzard 1 has no pilot either and is just a tank.<br>
<br>
Next Interrupts:<br>
Any means neccessary is my newest start, getting the dungeon allows me to drop ORS to the table first turn even if i get a bad draw.  And chall deploy reduction works, allowing me to flip for only 7 force.  It can also be used to get out of a frozen assests lock and use that ever use full ghhk.  Hidden weapons is incredible, that and Dr. E will clear out a battle quick.  Sniper is my newest way around A Gift, which is a pain to this deck.  And allows IG-88 to live up to his potential and pop off light side characters with no regard for a counter attack.  With the amount of retrieval in this deck you will be snipering poeple all game with IG-88 which is sure to piss off some poeple.  =)  Twi'lek is obvious<br>
<br>
Next Effects:<br>
<br>
All wrapped up puts the bounty hunter to work capturing light side characters and throwing them in the dungeon.  Broken concentration will slow down dagobah decks long enough to get a good foot hold and starting drain on tatooine.  Get the Tatooine Occupation going and that will usually put the nail in the coffin of most decks.  Den of thieves is plain enough.  Imperial arrest order will slow down attacks enough, and keep the battles happening on your turn where you can retrieve.  Scum is just a great all around card making the deck work almost anywhere, and helping to deploy high cost ships in space, where ORS come out for free.  Which most people over look.  There'll be hell to pay is just to stop senses or annoying retrieving for the light side.<br>
<br>
<br>
So basically to wrap up, take off tatooine, drain for 3 a turn at each of the big drain spots on tatooine, and occupy for a bunch more.  They come to the planet beat them up and throw them in the dungeon (bounty cards take to much space, but this requires nothing but the dungeon)you can easily retreive 4-10 cards a turn during heavy battle turns and light side never packs the counters for dark side retrieval.  You can slow down there drains else where by throwing a ORS and a few bounty hunters and battle as neccessary.  Hope I didn't miss anything.  Oh in the case of numbers which is getting alot more popular these days, the bounty hunters aren't really needed, leaving your total at 6, and retrieving 1 ORS a turn can fix most of the damage that they can cause.  I'm thinking about putting a search and destroy in to put some more screws into the non-interactive light side decks.  OH and you can use the jabba palaces game text to reshuffle numbers every turn... Ok tell me what you think.  Oh and grimtash although it can hurt, the only real loses would be the ORS and you get most of those back with the objective anyway, i have never lost a game to a grintash and played this at 1 regional, 1 invitational losing only one game.  I also played this all last year in one form or another and at the Worlds. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
