I also have decided to stop submitting decks because no thought is put into people's review.  So I decided to write this to help anybody who lacks the skills to write proficiently.  So if this article sounds like I am pissed off, that is because I am.  <br>
<br>
1 ACTUALLY READ THE ENTIRE DECK AND THE STRATEGY<br>
	This means you are going to have to read.  I       know it's hard, but you gotta do it some day, why not give it a shot. <br>
<br>
2 AFTER READING THE SUBMISSION ASK YOURSELF IF THE DECK HAS THE APPROPRIATE CARDS TO BEAT ALL THE CURRENT DECK ARCHEATYPES (types, if this is a too big word to comprehend) <br>
	This means you should have read it, if not refer to step 1. If the deck has all of the necessary cards to beat the popular decks now then it should theoretically do well. Take this into consideration.  If there are any weaknesses, take this into consideration also.<br>
<br>
 3 USE THE FULLEST EXTENT OF YOUR EDUCATION TO COMPOSE A REVIEW.<br>
	If you don't understand the deck, then this means you shouldn't be rating it.  If you don't like the deck simply 	because it is not your type of deck, you shouldn't be rating it. If you dislike the person, you shouldn't be rating 	it. If you have to read what others have put to form an opinion, you shouldn't be rating it.  I'm not saying don't rate the decks, only rate it if you have a grasp of the concept of the deck.<br>
<br>
4 DECKS ARE POSTED TO HELP IMPROVE THEM, REMEMBER THIS WHEN COMPOSING THE REVIEW<br>
	One word ratings are not going to cut it, ratings like 'i dont like it.. seems kinda stretched, and unfocused' as 	quoted from a scrub are also not going to cut it.  This review 'A loser, laugh at it, then destroy it, then verbally abuse the amker of this deck! Oh yeah, it sucks my right nut!' as also quoted from a scrub says a lot about the ass that wrote it.  You need to put some reasonable collection of random thoughts together if you cannot form an educated answer.  Remember they have chimps in rooms that can put together some kind of random thoughts, and I'd hope as the most advanced creature, we can also do the same.  Rate the deck the way that you would have your deck rated.  Suggestions for improvements should be required, as well as the weaknesses (keeping in mind that everybody does not play decks with a counter for EVERY card).  Also you should not let your play style influence your rating.  Some people are aggressive, while others like drawn out games.  Once again this should be kept in mind.  If you are rating a newer player's deck do you think that they are going to know all of the abbreviations for the cards? (ex.  Gift of The Mentor v/s GOTM)<br>
<br>
5 DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU<br>
	Ah yes, the golden rule.  If a deck is bad, I would want someone to at least say it gently and suggest improvements.  If someone is new to the game and you say that their deck sucks, how does that help them, thats I guess you told them.  If you totally thrash the person, they might be prone to do something malicious to you (rate all of your decks unfavorably with one word reviews, have all of their friends rate your decks bad, etc). The game is for fun, winning is there to motivate you.  Remember you are not trying to make enemies for life.<br>
<br>
6 AFTER COMPOSING A WELL THOUGHT OUT REVIEW ONE SHOULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR SKILLS<br>
	If you sit down and think of each card and how it works, that makes you a better player.  You can tell if someone puts some time into your review, if they do, send them a message thanking them for their help (you might even make a new friend).<br>
<br>
And I conclude my article on this note, you know what I think of anybody who doesn't like this article?<br>
<br>
Thats right, It doesn't Matter what you think.<br>
