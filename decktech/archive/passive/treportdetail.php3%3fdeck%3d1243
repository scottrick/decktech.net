That means you aren&#146;t aloud to play mains, premium cards and you are only aloud to play 2 rares.  <br>
<br>
My decks were:<br>
LS: characters are non-unique aliens.  Kashyyk Ops(7), Wookie(12), Ithorian(5) and H&#146;nemthe(4) and Bothan Spy(2).  I start with Kashyyyk, careful planning, farm and swamp.  I am also playing 6 Nar Shadda Windchimes.  My 2 rares were 2 Home Ones which are the only ships I was playing.  I am also playing disrupter pistols. admiral Ackbar is my lone unique character.<br>
<br>
DS:  starting in this deck was Death Star: War Room, prepared defenses, Inconsequential Losses, Imperial Arrest Order and Mobilization Points.  I am playing Royal Guards and force pikes.  I use mobilization points and arrest order for force and to take control of the ground.  I deploy my royal guards to coruscant docking bay then move them around.  I used Sythe Squad TIEs and Tallon Rolls along with some weapons to forfiet.  I am also using VCSDs and a Executor in the air.  My other rare was strategic resrves to cancel drains.<br>
<br>
Game 1 DS vs Mike Thompson (Ralitir Freighter Captains, B-Wing Bombers, Intruder Missles, Wookies, Scouts, Dressilan Commandos and docking days.<br>
<br>
He started with Ralitir HFTMF and staging areas, insurrection, and strike planning.  Right off he used strike planning to get out his other rare, Crix Madine. I get Executor with Mobilization Points.<br>
  I pull the coruscant: docking bay and drop a royal guard there and pick up 1.  On his turn he get out the Home One: Docking bay and puts Madine down and gets a scout.<br>
<br>
  He is getting a scout every turn and I am starting to get strong with the royal guards but am having trouble finding force pikes.  He eventually gets out Endor Docking bay and a spaceport docking bay to ralitir and starts getting down small characters.  <br>
<br>
  I take over the air (ralitir and kessel) and am draining him for 3 or 4 a turn.  I get him with a couple #s inserts for about 4 or 5 each time.  He lands a big battle on a lone Royal guard at the Executor docking bay using a wookie, a ralitir freighter captain and Momow Nadon to get there.  He is only draining me for around 2 a turn but is starting to m@#$% a ground force and starts chasing me around.  <br>
<br>
  When he drains at the Executor docking bay I counter @#$%ault.  I draw a 6, 4, and 4 to his 6 power.  He loses 8 and is now running low on force and I am overpowering him when I hit a character a battle with a force pike.<br>
<br>
  This game finishes by me draining him for more each turn.<br>
<br>
FW 2(+12)<br>
Highlights: Counter @#$%ault for 8.<br>
Lowlights: His spy gown to the executor docking bay.<br>
<br>
Game 2 LS vs Evan ??????? (death star 2 starter with tempest 1 and tempest scout 1)<br>
<br>
  He started the endor system and played prepared defenses to get Battle Plan, Combat Response, and another effect that he didn&#146;t use.  The first turn he gets out 2 TIEs to Endor (using Combat Response for one).  My first turn I drop a h&#146;nemthe and operative to swamp and deploy forest from reserve deck.  I put down Ackbar and a operative to the forest.  His male imperials deploy +2 to all my sites and at the swamp he has to pay +3 to battle.  he pays to drain for 2 and I lose to from my deck, nothing major.  He draws.  On my turn I drain for 4 and put down a Ithorian at the swamp and look for the jungle which is my last site, not there.  he looks through my deck and comments on the Home One that is in there.  i draw the remainder of my force and pick up my second Home One.<br>
<br>
   Next turn he puts down a TIE defender to Kashyyyk thinking I didn&#146;t have a second Home One.  He drains me as usual at Endor.  Picks up.  I drop my Home One and pound the TIE into the ground.  He loses 6.  Now i can drain for free.<br>
<br>
  He deploys to the farm with an Elite Squadron Stromtrooper and Corporal Drazin.  Drains for 2 as usual.  picks up.  I add a wookie to my forces and move over to the farm.  I drained for 5.<br>
<br>
  He drains for 2 but I finally had Barganing table out so I cancel his drain with a alien.  He moves his troopers away to the jungle.  On my turn I deploy 2 wookies and a h&#146;nemthe to the jungle and play a disruptor pistol.  Oh ya I drained for 7 that turn.  I battle his troopers and get rid of Drazin with the distuptor pistol.  He loses the battle by 18.  He loses the Elite squad and 15 force.  I move my Home One over to block his drain.  He is down to 2 cards.  He draws.<br>
<br>
FW 4(+41)<br>
Highlights: Good starts and 2 crippling battles<br>
Lowlights: Not getting Barganing table fast.<br>
 <br>
Game 3 DS vs Ryan Mayhue (A-Wings w/cannons, bothan spys and undercovers)<br>
<br>
  This is the second most cheesy deck I have ever seen.  His rares were a Home One and Kiffex.  He started kiffex and played HFTMF to get Superficial Damage, insight serves you well and another effect.  Your insight serves you well was annoying because he didn&#146;t ditch it for anything so my #s didn&#146;t work.  This game was really boring.  He drew Kessel in his opening hand and got stuff down to it first turn.  I got a Royal Guard w/forcepike out on my turn.<br>
<br>
  For about 4 turns I was taking drains of 3 and lost Strategic reserves to one of them.  I got out another Royal Guard and Major Miarna to Spaceport docking bay and Endor docking bay and deployed search and destroy (this card won me the game, I was hitting him with it from the 3rd turn of the game).  The next turn after that I deployed 2 TIEs and a VCSD against his 2 a-wings and 2 cannons .  I beat him and he lost an a-wing and a cannon.  The next turn he put down Home One and i barriered it.  He has a bothan with undercover at one of my docking bays.  <br>
<br>
  I put down a 3rd TIE against his Home One and a-wing.  I play tallon roll to get rid of his a-wing and deploy a TIE cannon and battle his Home One.  I play relentless pursuit to make his Home One power 0.  I win the battle by 14.  he just loses 14 cards and leaves the Home One.<br>
<br>
  Next turn he plays a bothan spy to my war room to start draining for 2 and he puts down 2 a-wings and battles I lose 2 TIEs.  On my turn I put down another VCSD and move to Bespin and Kiffex (he has no cards in hand and 4 left in deck).<br>
<br>
  he drains at Kessel and i loses 3, then he drains at the War room and I counter @#$%ault him for 4 to end the game.<br>
<br>
FW 6(+50)<br>
Highlights: Search and Destroy working perfectly and pounding Home One.<br>
Lowlights:playing such an annoying deck<br>
<br>
If I win my next game I win the tournemnet<br>
Game 4 LS vs Ryan Mayhue (counter @#$%aults, holoboard, limited resources, fear, defensive fire)<br>
<br>
  This is the cheesiest deck I have ever seen.  The whole game he was only playing defensive fire, fear, limited resources, and counter @#$%aults.  This was honestly the most boring game of star wars i have ever played.  Since he did the same boring crap the whole game I will just say what i did.  <br>
<br>
  When i relized he was playing a character less deck I signaled to get I Hope She&#146;s Alright and put a wookie at every site so i could drain with out being counter @#$%aulted.  At the jungle I put an operative, Ithorian, and 3 wookies.  at the jungle I get power +1 for all my aliens.  Now I had him losing 7 from drains and 1 each turn from i Hope She&#146;s Alright.  he was doomed.<br>
<br>
FW 8(+61)<br>
Highlights: Being smart<br>
Lowlights: Being bored out of my mind<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed the report of my first tournement win.  i won 75 black bordered banthas, 9 Japanese banthas, 9 bb Rogue Banthas, 1 Jap. Rogue Bantha, 5 bantha herds, 5 URoRRuR&#146;R&#146;R&#146;s Banthas, a Jap. Motti, a dark waters, and another rare.<br>
