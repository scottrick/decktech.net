Its in the CRD, which I've used as my brief description of the deck.<br>
<br>
Second. It has become obvious that there are members of DeckTech who will review a deck based on how it will improve the rating of their own deck instead of giving the deck what it really deserves. They should be ashamed of themselves.<br>
<br>
Finally, there were some problems with the previous version of this deck. I've added a few things to help aleviate those problems. I'll go through it point-by-point.<br>
<br>
Against HB: Suck down their Organized Attack and use ZIMH and DIPO to deprive them of immunity and battle destiny. Always hold onto one Overload. You never know when an EPP will make an appearance. Its also good for blowing up X-Wing Laser cannons.<br>
<br>
Against EPPs: Use The Dark Path to guarentee a draw of 0 for Overload. Knock out the most strategicly powerful character. For instance, If Luke, Han and Leia are battling together, blow up Han. Without him, the LS gets one battle destiny. Of course, if you're going to fight them, use IG-88 or Bossk to capture Leia and blow up Luke with Overload. That leaves Han vs. one or two of your characters, which is at least one battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Against EPPs in space: Aboard the Falcon, there's only room for one pilot. Ironically, Chewie doesn't add a battle destiny or draw one if not able to otherwise. If EPP Han is the other pilot, wait for your opponent to start a battle. Dark Path for a 0 and Overload EPP Han. Its too late for the LS to make Luke or Leia a pilot if onboard, leaving them with no battle destiny.<br>
<br>
Against MWYHL: Put Vader on one of your ships that can land, and drop him at Yoda's Hutt. You'll never see a muppet run faster. Even if you don't have Vader, just landing the ship there cancels Yoda's Hutt's game text.<br>
<br>
Against non-EPP mains: Set up your drains, block theirs with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, retrieve with SFS and once-per-game SRF. When you have a good selection of characters to KO their ground forces, go for it. If they might come back strong, go for the lone Vader beatdown, lose Vader and retrieve him with a TIE Bomber next turn. If they play weapons on their characters, be even happier. Now you're getting two cards for one Overload. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
