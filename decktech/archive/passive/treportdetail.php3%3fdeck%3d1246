On to the story........<br>
<br>
Well, I go to Port Huron on Friday night to playtest a little. I&#146;m playing Hidden Base and Hunt Down, two decks that I built on Thursday for the tourney. The decks are kinda easy, so there isn&#146;t too much I have to test. So the wife comes along and we bring our Raw Deal cards cause that game is pretty damn cool and we bring our kids cause we sorta have to since leaving a 5yr old to watch a 3yr old is a no no. Besides, my son is a cool mo-fo and I&#146;ll take him anywhere. We had just started playing Raw Deal on Tuesday, and it being Friday, I had already mastered the game (I was 2-3 against the wife. That is good enough to be called &#146;Master&#146;). Anyways, we get to the shop and I play a game with my HB and it crushes, even when I make mistakes. I&#146;ll Take The Leader is tech. Then I go play some Raw Deal, which the wife and I bought like 20 packs of and didn&#146;t get an UR. Then this kid buys one pack and gets an UR like the lil woman he is. Then another couple bought 5 packs and got another UR. So I trade for it cause it&#146;s the People&#146;s Elbow and I gotta have that card for my Rock deck.<br>
<br>
I promptly get my butt handed to me by these peeps who are like gods at Raw Deal. I learn real quick that it&#146;s &#146;all about the reversals&#146;. Yeah?? Well, suck my choad with your reversals cause I&#146;ve only played for 4 days. So, The Rock takes beats by Stone Cold and Undertaker (a chick, and I hate losing to chicks) and even by another Rock. It was not pretty and I was pissed cause I get pissed when I lose at anything. Then I go test my Huntdown deck and watch my wife school my Uncle in Raw Deal. My Hunt Down beats an EBO deck, but barely because Vader didn&#146;t wanna come out and play and I couldn&#146;t Alter Honor. But he came out and I win, which makes up for The Rock losses. To finish off the night, I played a lil old school Magic and kicked rotund buttocks with my Voltron deck cause it takes like 5 pieces to make it work and then I win cause I have 5 katrillion life and no one can stop me (Soul Warden, Skyshroud Elf, Initiates Of The Ebon Hand, Dauthi Ghoul, some 2 mana Shadow, Fecundity, Mortuary and Ashnods Alter). Old school, baby! :P We get home at 12:30 and I watch DBZ til 1am cause DBZ is just that damn good. I start messing with decks and whoever said that using Capital ships in HB is retarded cause they are too expensive. So I take out this, add that and say I&#146;m good to go and go to bed at 1:30am. <br>
<br>
bzzzzt! 6am, time to make the donuts. Work sucks. 12pm is the tourney time and I gotta work til 9:30 and then drive for an hour to play. Man does it suck. But its overtime and I can use the money to buy cards, so I can handle being a loser with no sleep. :P I bum a Master P cd from my buddy, Jared, and pump some rap for the hour drive. Everybody say Uhhhh! Uhhhh! na na na naaaaaaa!<br>
<br>
I arrive at the store at 10:50 and play some WWF Raw Deal cause the game can be fast and it&#146;s fun. So, my Uncle, he owns the shop, and my buddy Douglas play a triple threat match and I lose cause of the Mandible Claw. That means we play again and Triple H and The Rock beat the poo outta Mankind in like 5 minutes. It suddenly becomes 11:40 and somebody from an hour away calls and says they will be here in 45min to play and we wait. We waited til 12:30 and the guy hadn&#146;t shown, so we start a half hour late which is no big thing.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
<br>
LS - HB/matching pilots/I&#146;ll Take The Leader<br>
DS - AnktoHunter Hunt Down and Bend You Over<br>
<br>
game 1:<br>
<br>
my LS vs. James (1520) McGrath&#146;s RalOps<br>
<br>
The game starts slow with the typical stuff and on turn 3 he deploys Mara Jade and saber to the forest and I deploy Wedge/Red 1 and Biggs/Red 3 to a converted Raltiir. The game still goes slow and he deploys a couple Tempest Scouts to some site and I deploy Kiffex and deploy Cracken/Tala1 to Raltiir, move wedge and buddy to Kiffex and leave some force. Drain, drain and then I flip and deploy to Kessel with schmoe/ship and Twass Khaa to Jungle. I cancel drains and he deploys Chimaera and Piett and beats up on the Kessel schmoe for a big force loss. I then deploy monster Luke to the Jungle with saber and leave force cause of Raltiir&#146;s GT. He drains for 1, I drain for 5 and he deploys Executor and pilot to probe. I deploy schmoe/ship to Kessel. He drains for 2, I drain for 8. Game over from then on. FW by 7.<br>
<br>
2 (+7)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Hrm. None really.<br>
Lowlights: Getting a beatdown on Kessel.<br>
<br>
So after the game, I look up and Casey Galvan had shown up which is cool. All the kids and new players were excited that the #1 ranked player in Michigan had shown up. Now we had an even 18.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
<br>
My DS vs. Nick (1467) Huston&#146;s Profit<br>
<br>
I deployed Mara via his Objective and then Vader first turn to flip. He loses 1 and it&#146;s Masta Luke and he is all upset. He is a newer player, so I kinda get the notion that he only has 1 or 2 Lukes in the deck. His turn, I Shock a site, he draws up and loses a card. My turn, I search for Shocking, see Maras Saber, deploy it and move to JP. His turn, he deploys Obi, Chewie and schmoe to battle. I slice at Obi, miss and then slice him the second time and hit. I lose by 3, he loses all but Chewie and next turn I beat him down for 13 or so. I take it easy from then on and deploy S&amp;D and hit him for 2 a turn and a drain of 4. Full win by 17.<br>
<br>
4 (+24)<br>
<br>
Highlights: None.<br>
Lowlights: Um, none.<br>
<br>
So there are 4 undefeateds and I am 1 of them.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
<br>
My DS vs. Charlie&#146;s (1500) RTP<br>
<br>
I wanted to turn it on here. I wanted to crush Charlie cause the fool beat me down in Raw Deal. First turn, Vader with saber to DS: DB, flip, he loses 1. His turn, draw up, lose 1. My turn, drain, Emperor to DS: DB, get Force Lightning, move Vader to Y4 DB, he loses 1. He states &quot;the game is over&quot;. He deploys to Y4: DB and tries to beat LV down, but the guy is a monster and I lose 3 and he loses all. I drain then deploy +1 drain Emperor&#146;s Helper to DS, deploy S&amp;D, make him lose two a turn and 4 to drains and its over. FW +33<br>
<br>
6 (+57)<br>
<br>
Game 4:<br>
<br>
My LS vs. Casey (1963) Galvan&#146;s TIEs<br>
<br>
I had a bundle of mistakes in this game. A couple turns pass and we have around 9 systems on the table. We are both drawing up and waiting for the other person to do something. So I go first and deploy 2x Schmoe/ship to Endor and I&#146;ll Take The Leader. He responds by deploying 2x Dreadnaught and 4 TIEs and a Lateral Damage on one Schmoe. I lose said Schmoe and 6 cards from top. I then deploy GS1/Lando/Numb and he Barriers Numb. I say that Numbs GT still counts cause it says &#146;with&#146;, not &#146;in a battle with&#146; and we can&#146;t find information to back up either of our arguments, so we agree that Numb can use his GT. If I was wrong, I&#146;m wrong. I then deploy General Solo (who says &#146;in a battle with&#146;) in R2inR5 and battle. I draw 2 6&#146;s for BD and I&#146;m immune to his BD. I then move GS1 to Kessel. He draws up. I flip and drain for 4. I deploy another pair of ships and schmoes to Kiffex and say go. Another battle or two later, I was drain at Kessel, Fondor, Death Star and the DS: DB with Luke + saber and he was draining for 2 or 3. I win. Full win +11.<br>
<br>
8 (+68)<br>
<br>
Highlights: I&#146;ll Take The Leader for wreckage. :P<br>
Lowlights: Not using full advantage of his First Strike. Not spreading late game to win by more.<br>
<br>
Game 5:<br>
<br>
My DS vs. Caseys TIGIH M&amp;T<br>
<br>
I played this game horribly. I went through this game trying to satisfy Honor instead of draining at sites and that cost me. I deploy Emperor&#146;s Helper to Endor: DB on the first turn to make him only activate 4. He moves over, deploys honor and I lose 1. I drain have to look for Vader next turn and then lose 3. He then deploys Wedge/Red 1 and I&#146;ll take the leader to Rendili and I can&#146;t get rid of Honor. Next turn, I drain, deploy LVader + saber, take Luke, flip. His turn, he drains for 1 and deploys BoShek to CC: DB. I drain, deploy Iggy and Mara + Saber to CC: DB and battle. He Levitations my saber and loses boshek +4 and I lose Mara. He drains and passes. I then deploy Zuckuss and BinHT to Rendili and don&#146;t iniate cause he barriered BinHT, he loses to Visage and S&amp;D. Next turn, he deploys X-Wing cannons, kills Zuckuss, gets rid of BinHT, I put a card on his Effect and we are back to normal. By now, I have Emperor&#146;s Helper at CC: DB with Iggy and LV at DS: DB and Davod Jon + Helper at Endor: DB. I then deploy Chimaera to Rendili for some stupid reason, battle and die and lose a card to his effect. He then deploys EPP Han + Orrimarrko to Endor: DB and beats down my two guys and I lose two force and put a card on his effect. I am 1 card away from being turned. So, I deploy Emperor to DS:DB with an Admiral, move LV to Endor and satisfy honor. He then deploy hit squad to DS: DB. Draws destiny with his last card, I lose, put a card on his effect and he turns vader after he recirculates. Full Loss (-15). <br>
<br>
Highlights: None.<br>
Lowlights: Deploying Mara to the CC:DB, when I shoulda put her at the Hut. Deploying ZinMH and BinHT instead of waiting a turn or two. Deploying the Chimeara with no pilot and losing. Not just sitting on the Hut and Endor: DB and draining for 5 a turn. I shoulda just ignored trying to satisfy Honor. Moving LV away from the Emperor. I was just dumb.<br>
<br>
Well, I finished 4-1 (+53), cause we couldn&#146;t fit in 6 games so we all dropped, and ended up 3rd. Not bad for not playing in 4 months.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I played some tag team Raw Deal. It was The Rock and Stone Cold vs. Mankind and the Undertaker (that chick I lost to earlier in the TR). I totally kicked buttocks. Charlie and I won 4 straight before the wussies quit. I then went home and promptly beat the wife in a couple games to. :P<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Craig Berry for making the trip.<br>
Jeremiah Himmelbrand for tagging along with Craig.<br>
Casey Galvan for showing up.<br>
Dan Ellis for holding the tourney.<br>
The Makers of Raw Deal cause that game is fun as all get out.<br>
All the Po-Ho playa&#146;s cause they are all pretty new at the game and all getting better.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Jeremiah Himmelbrand for beating the crap outta the newer players when I told him to take it easy. He lost 2 games and had the highest differential.<br>
The gas prices cause they suck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="treports.php3"><img src="images/tback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="treportread.php3?deck=1246"><IMG SRC="images/tread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="treportprint.php3?deck=1246" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/tprint.GIF" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR>
