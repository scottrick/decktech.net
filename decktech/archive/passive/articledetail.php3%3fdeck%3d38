<br>
I thought a quick guide on 'how to' and 'posting reviews' guide might be an asset to Decktech and it's newer members just starting out.... so here it is!<br>
<br>
     Two Heads Are Better Than One.<br>
<br>
More than a few of us has collaborated with freinds in trying to make better decks for a tournament.  DeckTech works on a similar principle.  Here you can post your deck and articles of wisdom to recieve feedback from many of the 400+ people currently registered.<br>
<br>
The ride doesn't end there, tho... you can also turn around and review THEIR decks and articles (learning something in the process we hope).  Pretty basic stuff that, if you found this article, you probably already know.<br>
Still there are things you can do that make it better for everyone.<br>
<br>
Learning 'Netiquette' is one.  Pretend that the person you are writing to is twice as big, 3 times as strong, and physically present with you, then don't say anything you wouldn't in front of your mother {:p  <br>
<br>
If you don't like the deck you should tell them WHY and, if possible, what they can do to make it better.  This applies even if the improvements still don't make it a tournament viable deck.  Just saying 'it sucks!' is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
When you see something good in a deck or article, again, you need to say what was good about it.  If we don't leave these notes, no-one else will ever learn WHY it's good or WHY it sucks, taking all the advantage out of the DeckTech.<br>
<br>
If you cannot add anything by posting, good or bad, it's probably better that you don't (netiquette again).<br>
<br>
Still pretty basic, right?  Well, now we go a different way... Say you've read a few reviews/decks by someone who has similar veiws as you or has demonstrated skill you want to learn.  Everything a person submits is stamped with their user name.  If you click on that name, you will be brought to their member page.  Everyone has a page, generated automatically,  and from there you can veiw any of the decks/articles that they have submitted and read up what people have said about them. Again, the strength of this site rests in the quality of the reviews.  If you, or someone else, doesn't stop to think before they write, you're not contributing!<br>
<br>
Another advantage to accessing the member page is that you can send them a message that they will recieve next time they sign into the site.  If there is a question you haveabout any comment of combonation you see, you can contact the author. By communicating directly with the people who post, you can sometimes learn more than what we post about here.  At the very least you can try to clarify something that you didn't quite understand. (I won't tell you how long it took me to discover what PB3 deck was).<br>
<br>
Communication.  That pretty much sums up purpose of the site.  If we don't share what we have learned, then the people who seek to take advantage of this site (namely, US) cannot benefit from it!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?deck=38"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?deck=38" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR>
