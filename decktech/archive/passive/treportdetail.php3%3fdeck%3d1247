<br>
After about a week of deciding whether to quit this game or not, I decided I would let one last tournament make up my mind. If I do well, I stay. If I do poor, I go. I was tired of playing Rebel Strike Team just because it is always the same game no matter what the opponent plays. So... it is back to mains for me! My Dark I really liked, so I just wanted to improve on it. I figured Profit gave it the hardest match, so I had to fix it. I remember reading somewhere about this anti-Profit deck that started the Entrance Cavern and Jabba&#146;s Palace, so it gave LS a choke and had a non-battleground in between the Audience Chamber and Jabba&#146;s Palace to prevent some Or Be Destroyed damage. I changed my starting stuff to that, and had some extra spaces for Search And Destroy and some other cool things.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
Light - Tosche Mains with crazy S/A (6/4). Added some cards I always wanted in my old Tosches, but never had room (like Advantage). Did well in limited playtesting.<br>
Dark - Profit Killing Abyssins. Whenever I use Scum, I have this urge to play Abyssins cuz they are just so damn good.<br>
<br>
The night before I feel like being different so I start coloring some of my cards. Obi*s Hut was red bordered and it was really trippy. Nabrun became blue bordered and Sorry About The Mess was green bordered. <br>
<br>
Game One: DS vs. Arthur Koch (1487)<br>
He starts Rebel Strike Team along with Insurrection, Strike Planning, and Your Insight Serves You Well. On my first turn I drop Jabba (SE) to the Audience Chamber along with a Chevin to soak up attrition since I don*t have enough Force for the Ephant Mon in my hand. He drops Madine and Solo to his Rebel Landing Site. On my turn I back up Jabba with Ephant and move the Chevin to the Entrance Cavern since I have None Shall Pass in my hand. I draw up Twi*lek Advisor so I go and grab Scum on my next turn.<br>
<br>
I leave his people alone while he sets up by deploying Geezum and the Back Door. He finally sets up everything and moves Chewie Of Kashyyyk, General Solo, and Corporal Delevar to the Bunker and leaving Madine, Geezum, and a Dresselian Commando at the Rebel Landing Site. I attack him at the RLS with ECC 4-LOM, Chall, and 3 Abyssins. I wipe out the Geezum and Dresselian (after cancelling it&#146;s text) and I regenerate an Abyssin. He moves Madine over to the Bunker and I stay put. He doesn*t have any Charges out to blow the Bunker so I feel safe. He drops 2 at once and I know that I can*t let him blow up the Bunker so I move an Abyssin over there along with a Ghhhk in hand. He fights it off and I do this another turn with another Abyssin. Then I attack him with Mara and 2 Abyssins but I Projective Telepathy our battle so I retreived my Ghhhk. <br>
<br>
Then I Masterful Move for the Ghhhk I just retreived on his turn and he fights me. I lose a couple and an Abyssin and he loses General Solo and a scrub. This goes on for a couple of turns until I run out of characters and Ghhhks so he blows the Bunker. I lose the eight but I&#146;m still in the lead since he wasn*t causing me nearly as much damage as I was causing him before he blew the Bunker. It gets ruled that U-3P0 cannot block his drain of 4 at the Back Door (Midge, Jedi Luke, Ithorian) which sucked big time. I drop Chall and 2 Abyssins to Luke*s site and beat off Midge and the Ithorian and he kills off two Abyssins. I land Bossk In Bus from Endor to the Back Door for added forfeit then drain him out next turn. FW by 25<br>
<br>
Total: 2(+25)<br>
<br>
Highs: Preventing him blowing the Bunker for so long. Ghhhk Engine =P<br>
Lows: Not much<br>
<br>
Game Two: LS vs. Patrick Hines (1570)<br>
Well Patrick starts Endor Operations with Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and You Cannot Hide Forever. First turn he ditches Hide Forever for Security Precautions and grabs the Executor with Mobilization Points. He then drops Admiral Piett to the Endor Landing Platform. I get a god hand with EPP Luke, Obi-Wan, and Gift Of The Mentor. I decided that I would rather have Obi-Wan come out to the Landing Platform first turn with a Saber then to wait a second turn for Luke. I grab Obi his Stick and have just enough force to initiate the battle. He loses Piett and 3. He draws the next couple of turns and I back up Obi with EPP Luke and Orrimaarko. I draw a couple and find my Nabrun Leids which I was looking for to get over to Tosche.<br>
<br>
On his turn he drops Mara with Saber and Blizzard 1 with Captain Godhert piloting. I drop Chewie to Obi*s Hut then Nabrun my group to the Hut during my move phase. He drops Choke Vader and battles since I put down Order To Engage the last turn. I Weapon Levitate Mara*s Saber to Orrimaarko and he misses the choke on Chewbacca. I Clash Vader and he loses Mara. I lose Obi-Wan because I have a Ben in my hand. I put Vader into an Uncontrollable Fury while he&#146;s still Clashed then down comes Ben to wail on Blizzard 1 with Godhert. He only had to lose a couple after forfeiting though. I leave my guys where the were against a lone Vader so Patrick either has to fight me, or lose 5 to Order To Engage and Fury. He drops Igar and battles. I play I Know to bring EPP Leia out of reserve since I dropped EPP Han there last turn. I hit Igar and he plays Imperial Command to stop the 3 destiny I was going to draw. His side clears and I spread out to Tosche with Ben and EPP Luke. So I&#146;m draining for 2 a turn and then I drop Tantive IV and Lando In Falcon to his Endor. I had Spiral in hand since I knew he was using Zuckuss In Mist Hunter from some of his destiny draws. He then drops Lord Vader and Tempest 1 to the Dark Forest right after I drew Melas and Harc Seff. I drop them both to the Landing Platform and stop his drain. Then he deploys some other Tempest Scouts and moves over to the Landing Platform so I am stuck taking a beating at the Dark Forest since Lord is at the Landing Platform and I suspect he has Vader*s Saber. I deploy Cracken so the brunt of the attack isn&#146;t as bad and I put Harc Seff in the tank while leaving Cracken at the site. I put Harc back again to the Dark Forest to block the drains and I manage to eat him away with my drain of 3. FW by 26<br>
Total: 4(+51)<br>
<br>
Highs: Always having a defense against what Patrick was trying to do (Nabrun, Harc Seff). Choosing this deck over my Rebel Strike Team.<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
Game Three: LS vs. Ray Franks (1752)<br>
Well Ray was sporting a version of Monkey TIEs and started Oppressive Enforcement and There Is No Try (damn!) so my SAC was screwed unless I got out Honor Of The Jedi quick. He starts off by dropping an Interceptor to the Death Star Docking Bay and drawing some. I get Ben to Tosche with Jedi Luke, Draw Their Fire, and Orrimaarko in my hand. So he gets out Sienar and the Death Squadron Assault Squadron to Sullust with a Presence of the Force on it. That really sucks. I Signal for HotJedi so I can start playing SAC, but it is not there, so I feel like being evil and grabbed Uncontrollable Fury. The Death Star Squadron was stuck at Sullust the entire game, losing 2, since the closest system was 5 parsecs away, too far for a Dreadnaught. I drop Jedi Luke and Draw Their Fire on the lone Interceptor at the Death Star Docking Bay. Wow... I retreive one card, but that thing right there was my downfall.<br>
<br>
I eventually get Tantive IV with Melas and Chewbacca piloting to Wakeelmui, and Super Spiral (EPP Han, EPP Leia, I Know) to the Death Star. This is when my downfall starts. He is cancelling my drain at the Death Star every turn with an Interceptor in Dreaded Starfleet. Then he drops it to the Death Star Docking Bay (retreiving 1 for Sienar) then battles. He retreives one, I lose one. Then he sends the TIE to used pile with Sienar. That happened _every_ turn and I could not do anything about it because I could not find my Nabrun. I eventually have this situation: His 3 TIEs against my Super Spiral with out I Know in hand (already played it). Since he cannot move the TIEs without the Dreadnaught he just lost, they are stuck. I drop Home One and cause him two overflow damage, but manage to take back control of Wakeelmui. His draining of 3 at Sullust and eventually 3 at Kashyyyk was too much for me, along with his constant retreival. FL by 17. <br>
Total: 4(+34)<br>
<br>
Highs: The game was fun and interesting. Keeping the differential low. <br>
Lows: Damn SYCFA should only cancel battle damage if LS initiates the battle.<br>
<br>
So after that game we have like 15 minutes left so I feel like playing a fun game. Rob Werbicki (who by the way scrubbed out going 1-3 =P ) sits down and whips out this weird @#$% QMC with Grans, Paths, H*menthes and all this weird @#$% that he has told me about. I drop the bomb on Tycho in ship and DS2 Wedge in ship at Bespin by deploying Dengar in, Zuckuss in, and Fett in on the second turn. He tells me to lose some cards because of his Admiral Order, but it&#146;s all good. Skee announces there is 10 minutes until the next game, so he is all hurrying me up so I leave DiPO cuz I want to try something. He drains me for 4 next turn so I take off the top half of my reserve and ask if thats enough. He is cool with it cause he does not know what I am going to do. He thinks he is so cool because he drops Home One to Bespin and battles. I have my measley 4 power to his 30-something, and I will quote him exactly, *Lick ma nuts!*, so I get this grin on my face and smack down my Ghhhk, *No, lick _my_ nuts!* The look on his face was hilarious! He could not believe it, then he calls my a bastard under his breath. =)<br>
<br>
Game Four: DS vs. Adam Weinstein (1841)<br>
Ah ha! I played Adam last tournament with my COTVG version of my deck and got my @#$% whooped by his Profit, which is one of the reasons I switched the start. But alas, he is not playing Profit today. He is playing Mind What You Have Learned and starts Wise Advice, The Way Of Things, and some other card that helps Jedi Training.<br>
<br>
I get set up quick and I am draining him for 5 a turn until he passes Test 1 and Projections some sites. Then I get out Search And Destroy (while occupying 3 battlegrounds because of Honor) so he comes at a lone Abyssin with Tawss Khaa. I Barrier her and he has got no one else so he drops Order To Engage. I deploy IG-88 With Riot Gun and try to capture Tawss but miss with a 3, so he is saved for another turn until I do it again with another Abyssin as fodder so I can keep IG-88 on the table. This time I draw a 4 and end the battle. So he is losing to Search And Destroy while I am not taking any damage until he gets out Luke with Jedi Test 6. Eventually I start retreiving more than I am losing by fighting Luke with Abyssins then regenerating them until I drain him out. FW by 20<br>
Total: 6(+54)<br>
<br>
Highs: Beating someone I have never beaten before. Beating someone nearly 300 points higher than me.<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
After that game we play another for fun against his Profit to see how well my deck does. It wins somewhat easily so that means I have a good deck on my hands and winning over Adam was not a fluke, which makes me happy! So I get second place and get 3 packs of Cloud City and a DS SE Starter which is cool since I am such a scrub I have never boughten one before. I guess this made up my mind to stay in the game afterall...<br>
<br>
Final Standings:<br>
1 - Ray Franks - 8(+??)<br>
2 - Mike Merletto (ME!) - 6(+54)<br>
3 - Eddie Brown - 6(+12)<br>
...<br>
10 - Robert Werbicki 2(-??)<br>
11 - Henry Jicha 0(-??)<br>
<br>
So, after my long stint as a 1300 player, this tournament, when updated, will send me over the 1600 mark!
