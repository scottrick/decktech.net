<br>
  My non-objective Home One Mains deck has been winning very consistently.  One loss in four tournaments, a timed out game in which I was in total control of the board and about to drain for 8 a turn.  Good record, but I&#146;m getting bored of it, so I switch.<br>
<br>
  Light Side - The Bottom Line: Profit with all the right cards to put a m@#$%ive beatdown together.  <br>
<br>
  Dark Side - Twisted And Evil: Ferocious Hunt Down.  Honor Of The Jedi doesn&#146;t even slow it down.  I won&#146;t even bother putting No Escape in when JPSD is released, it just isn&#146;t necessary.  <br>
<br>
  Game 1 - LS versus Nick Jones&#146; Dueling Hunt Down<br>
<br>
  His two aliens for the Audience Chamber are Jabba The Hutt and Mara Jade.  He gets Darth Vader, Dark Lord Of The Sith down first turn at Jabba&#146;s Palace.  I deploy Master Luke there for free with Luke&#146;s Lightsaber and battle.  Swing, flip 5 and 4 to hit him.  He chokes Luke with a blind 6.  It&#146;s enough, since it targets ability, not defense value.  <br>
<br>
  He still has to lose Vader, who was slashed by the saber, but he dodged a fair-sized bullet, since The Force Is Strong With This One was about to make him lose some cards.<br>
I have to back off for a turn to load up on cards, and he gets Grand Moff Tarkin down at the Audience Chamber to reinforce his aliens.<br>
<br>
  Next turn, Nick deploys Vader to the Chamber and moves Mara out to Jabba&#146;s Palace.  I deploy Ben Kenobi and Master Luke to beat down Mara, play Gift Of The Mentor, and flip 1, 3, 1.  Lousy.  He gets a 6, so Mara covers the battle damage.  I forfeit Luke and revive him.<br>
<br>
  Nick moves Vader over from the Chamber and goes Epic with Vader&#146;s Obsession.  I play Courage Of A Skywalker, he plays Focused Attack.  Flip a 6, 5, 3, and he gets 3, 3, 3.  So Vader is placed out of play and he loses 9 force.  After we recirculate and lose to Visage, I ditch Your Insight Serves You Well to get Honor Of The Jedi. Deploy it, move to the Audience Chamber.<br>
 <br>
  He deploys 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle and battles, canceling Ben Kenobi&#146;s game text.  Target Jabba with Master Luke and draw a 5, returning him to Nick&#146;s hand.  Play The Force Is Strong With This One to add a destiny, draw 1 and 6, taking out Tarkin and 4-LOM.  <br>
<br>
  On my turn, release Han to flip the objective, then move to Jabba&#146;s Palace.  He deploys Jabba The Hutt and Sim Aloo to battle, I hit Sim with Han&#146;s gun and play Don&#146;t Get @#$%y, and four battle destiny clear the site and just about run him out of life force.  The objective damage and drains end it soon after.<br>
<br>
  Win by 29<br>
<br>
2 (+29)<br>
Highs: Winning three Epic Duels in the past three games against Hunt Down.  <br>
Lows: Losing Luke to the freak 6 destiny early on.<br>
<br>
  <br>
  Game 2 - DS versus Keith Watabayashi&#146;s Throne Room Mains<br>
<br>
  Keith gets a Nudj down at the Swamp and moves it to the Farm, then draws some cards and it&#146;s my turn.  Deploy Captain Sarkli at the Farm to turn off the force generation there.  Pull a docking bay, turn it over.<br>
<br>
  With only 3 force, he can&#146;t do much, besides deploy a location and draw cards.  I deploy Vader at Docking Bay 327 with his saber to flip.  Keith is still short enough on  force he can&#146;t beat Sarkli to a pulp, so I get to reinforce him next turn with Janus Greejatus and move them over to the Swamp.<br>
<br>
  Keith kills his own Nudj with EPP Luke and Wedge at the Swamp to turn it back into a battleground and flip my objective.  Battles, swings at Sarkli, hits, plays Force Is Strong With This One.  I flip a 4 to his 1 and 2.  Forfeit both my characters, he loses Wedge.<br>
<br>
  Deploy IG-88 With Riot Gun, 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle, and Mara Jade to the Swamp, spend 4 to initiate battle.  Target Luke with 4-LOM, he cancels the targeting with Blaster Deflection and swings at Mara, connecting.  Miss with the riot gun, flip 1 and 1, he also gets a 1.  Site is cleared except for Iggy.<br>
<br>
  He deploys the Cantina with Ben Kenobi and his lightsaber, and Orrimaarko.  I deploy Emperor Palpatine at the Swamp and move him and Iggy to the Throne Room.  EPP Luke goes up against Vader at DB327, but I play Put All Sections On Alert to cancel his game text and keep him from getting a battle destiny.  He deploys Draw Their Fire and battles, anyway, figuring it is better than waiting to get beat down next turn.<br>
<br>
  I swing and hit him, but flip low and he only loses Luke and 3 cards.  Deploy Sim Aloo and Tarkin at the Cantina to battle, retrieving Visage Of The Emperor with Draw Their Fire, and flip a tracked 6 for destiny.  He gets a 1, I forfeit Tarkin and he gives up Ben.  Keith deploys Romas &#146;Lock&#146; Navander for backup and battles, drawing a 5 to my 3.  He forfeits Romas, I forfeit Sim.  Track the Visage I retrieved, deploy Jabba The Hutt and battle.  He plays Smoke Screen and the site is cleared.<br>
<br>
  Now he&#146;s out of characters, so Visage and drains end the game quickly.  <br>
<br>
  Win by 24<br>
<br>
4 (+53)<br>
Highs: Slowing down yet another opponent with Sarkli.  <br>
Lows: Holding the line against mains with cannon fodder.<br>
  <br>
<br>
  Game 3 - LS versus Gran Hans-Petter&#146;s TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
  Just met this guy, he plays out in  Tacoma, about 40 miles from where I live.  Starts out with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, gets his people set up on Cloud City and gets Dark Deal deployed.  I get Ben Kenobi with his saber down at the Audience Chamber to wait for the signal to release Han and get some force back.<br>
<br>
  Meanwhile, after beating up a couple Imperials, Jedi Luke and EPP Leia chase around the other guys while Gran gets in some force drains by spreading out and taking advantage of my light load of characters.  I take over Bespin with Home One and free Han to flip and get back five high-destiny cards.  <br>
<br>
  It&#146;s been a while since I last took Profit to a tournament, so I make a couple stupid mistakes.  We&#146;re both losing half a dozen cards a turn, so the game won&#146;t last long.  The damage race eventually leads to a win by 5 for the Light Side.  Could have been less if I&#146;d spread on the last turn to stop a couple drains, but I didn&#146;t want to take any chances, and I knew I&#146;d finish him off if I didn&#146;t lose some cards in a battle.  <br>
<br>
  Win by 5<br>
<br>
6 (+58)<br>
Highs: Easy flip, uncontested control of space.<br>
Lows: Only one battle in the entire game.  <br>
<br>
<br>
  Game 4 - DS versus Nick Jones&#146; There Is Good In Him<br>
<br>
  The rematch.  Nick is a good player, I&#146;m not expecting an easy game until he reveals his objective.  There hasn&#146;t been a mainstream deck that folds that easily since Obi&#146;s Hut/Tosche Station starts were popular.  <br>
<br>
  First turn, I play Operational As Planned to put Evader on top of my force pile.  Deploy Lord Vader to the Landing Platform, shutting down Nick&#146;s force generation at Chief Chirpa&#146;s Hut and flipping my objective.<br>
<br>
  He activates 2, deploys Projection Of A Skywalker on the Landing Platform and a docking bay from the deck.  Then he moves Luke over to be captured by Vader.  No cards left to draw.  I activate 9, move Lord Vader to Chief Chirpa&#146;s Hut, and draw cards.<br>
<br>
  General Solo and Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk at the Hut battle Vader.  Play I Have You Now, draw a 1 and a 6, which he uses 2 force to cancel.  He flips low, too, so Vader stays and Han goes.  Lose 1 to I Feel The Conflict.  No force left, so Chewie can&#146;t move away.<br>
<br>
  Deploy Jabba The Hutt and 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle against Chewie, battle, draw a 6 and 1, he loses Chewie and some more cards to battle damage.  Nick deploys Orrimaarko to the Cloud City docking bay with Electrobinoculars.  Deploy Mara with her saber, battle, swing and connect, he draws a 5, I get a 2.  Lose 2 to Orri&#146;s text, one to I Feel The Conflict, clear the site.  <br>
<br>
  Drain at the Hut for a turn, then Nick deploys Ben Kenobi to Docking Bay 94 and transits to Endor.  Put my hand back with Reactor Terminal, drain, and move over.  He battles to end the game.  Swing, hit, flip a 6 and 5, the battle damage ends it.<br>
<br>
  Win by 33<br>
<br>
8 (+91)<br>
Highs: Fairly interactive.  <br>
Lows: Getting mobbed by Han and Chewie early on.  It hurt his chances in the long run, though.  He needed to be drawing cards.  <br>
  <br>
  Joe Olson and I are both undefeated, but he has 8 (+122), so he wins the tournament on differential.  We never got a chance to play each other this time, but his decks were the same ones he had last week, when I played him twice and won both games.  Oh well.  So he gets first place, I get second, and Keith Watabayashi takes third.  <br>
<br>
  Prize support was way cool, with lots of DSII and some Cloud City.  Some kid pulled an Emperor, to an odd cacophony of cheering and growling.  Thanks to Doug Taylor for running another great tournament, and to Broken Games for hosting it.  See y&#146;all at the next one!<br>
