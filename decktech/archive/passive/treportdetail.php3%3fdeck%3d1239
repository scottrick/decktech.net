The day before the &quot;big&quot; event. Me and all my pals are sitting around as usual. In fact i think we were watching the DVD of Spinal Tap. My favorite part is when the b@#$% player gets stuck in the little cocoon thing. Anyway we were all chillin and someone brought up the tourney. Now, this is the part that about half of us who orriginaly wanted to go decides that they dont feal like playing. So we get the numbers trimmed a wee bit and figure that 5 of us would be going.<br>
<br>
The next morning comes and I figured wed lose a few more people to sleep. This was true cause Mike and Ryan, two of the people that usualy go with me, choose to stay home and sleep. So, now its down to 3, and one of those people wasnt sure he wanted to go. But he decides to roll with us and around 9:10 were on the road. <br>
<br>
Alan needed to stop into the post office to send a package over to some guy in Norway that won an item from him in Ebay. That took forever so our plan of heading to White Castle was foiled. We end up going strait from the post office to the local book shop that the tourney was at. We figured there would be a great turn out cause this was the only tourney in Illinois, but our thoughts were wrong and not to many showed. The crowd consisted of me, 2 of my pals, Rob Giffen and some little sidekick of his, another couple of guys ive seen over in Wheaton before, and then a few people I havent had the chance to play against yet. So, we are sanctioned which is good, but we had an odd number of people so someone gets a bye. That someone ended up being me.....<br>
<br>
Game 1, I had a bye.<br>
Ummmm, this was when i got to sit around and do nothing. I was going to trek over to a card shop and try and pick up some limited dark side alters, but I was drawn inside of a laundry place that was showing some odd T.V. show that had some long haired guy talking about charades. Fearing for my life I ran back to the shop and chilled inside, waiting for my game.<br>
<br>
Game 2, My light vs Edmund Grays BHBM<br>
Well, this game was pretty cool. I was running my EBO, which has done rather well for me as of late. I set up EBO second turn and get some drains set. He had huge activation via Mob Points, and was doing a bit of damage to me. But the game turned when he dropped the executor and some pilot to one kessel, and the dreaded ZIM to another. He battled with the Executor and I hyper escaped away to where Zuckuss was sitting. He battled my other ship and I ended up losing an x-wing. Then I managed to see an open window and I jumped. I did organized attack and pulled out some x-wings. Dropped about 7 of em to say hi to Zuckuss and the game pretty much ended with that. I nailed him and he had to lose like 20 somethin. I spread and ended up out draining him.<br>
fw by 21 (4 +21)<br>
<br>
Highs: Yet again, the X-wings handed Zuckuss his @#$% on a platar.<br>
Lows:None really, my deck worked like a machine. I supose the worst part was seeing the executor come out, but oh well.<br>
<br>
Game 3, My Light Vs Brian Morrisons Rebel Base Occupation<br>
Dont ya hate it when ya have to play someone that ya know well, and that knows your deck almost as well as you do. This was one of those situations. The game was interesting, I got EBO set up and ran all over doing drains. He came to space and I tought him a lesson, then I drew some and he came to space again and tought me a lesson. So now its me running and draining and him doing the same. In the end, the power of EBO prevailed and I managed to win the game.<br>
fw by 14(6 +25)<br>
<br>
Highs:I won, thats about all. Not to many great moments in the game, but the game was fun so I was happy.<br>
Lows:Having to play a friend, I hate that.<br>
<br>
So, now me and Brian take off and head to White Castle, finaly we got to eat. We picked up some other stuff for some people and I had cheese sticks... Mmmmmmmmm chheeeeeeeese stiiiicks.<br>
<br>
Game 4 My dark vs Mickey Hoffmans weird deck.<br>
He started with jabbas palace, then he pulled insurection, staging areas, and strike planning. I was so confused at this point. I had no idea what to expect which was cool. Im doin a moddified version of my cancerous courtroom deck. I set up the emporer at the audience chamber and get workin. The game went downhill soon, I dropped Mara and Dr. E to where Ben was sitting. I battled and he clashed Mara, then beat the hell out of Dr. E. I was in shock, the rest of the game went in a similar way. I lost good cards, and if he lost something good hed get it back with Ketwols text. He pulled out generals and scouts and set up drains with midge along with getting huge activation. The deck was realy cool, and I think he won all of his games with it but I may be wrong. The rest of the game consisted of him roughing up some more of my guys and me sitting with a low drain, to his bigger drain. The court deck takes a hit, and it was a hard hit at that.<br>

<br>
This is when the whole Marlboro thing occurs. Throughout the day Rob and this other guy would finish a game and run out to smoke. Then Dave, the other guy, finishes his 4th game and says, &quot;well, im off to marlboro country.&quot; We laughed cause it was funny. So, the back of the bookstore is now known as marlboro country. I managed to break through the border a few times, but I dont think Ill return any time soon.<br>
<br>
Game 5, My Dark vs Rob Giffens Speed Profit.<br>
Well, theres something you dont see a lot of, speed profit. Yes I mean that in the most sarcastic of ways. I start a cc engineer and Boelo, convert the site, pluck out some docking bays, draw a few and end my turn. Rob draws and thats about it. I start, pluck out miiyoom, and drop myo. Rob goes and drops ben with a blade to kill Miiyoom. He dices her and I cancel his destiny. He ends up needing to lose 5, and he pitched Ben. On my turn I drop out igar to a docking bay, and a few more people to the chamber. Rob comes with Masta Luke, and Ben. He battles and does a gift of the mentor. He draws a 1 to bounce Beolo, draws 2 ones to hit Beolo, and for his 3 destiny he drew 2 0s and a 1 which was canceled. I drop more people and fight and he draws 0s again. This was how the whole game went. wed fight and hed draw 0s, if he drew anything higher it got canceled. Lady luck was against Rob it seemed. So in the end, I had some minor drains, and Ability x3 set up. He freed han eventualy but couldnt pay to retrieve, so he didnt get anything back, after that the game ended.<br>
fw by 19 (8 +29)<br>
<br>
Highs:Beating Rob<br>
Lows:Rob drew crap for destiny, it was good for me, but it sucked for him.<br>
<br>
Now we get to go into the land of no return. We decide we need Dairy Queen, a mistake I made more then once that day. We head there and Rob looks at me and says, &quot;Why does it smell like bad milk?&quot; i shrugged and simply said &quot;dont buy anything with ice cream in it i guess.&quot; So Rob was nice and bought me a fruity drink thing that tasted like piss(not that i know what piss tastes like, but i @#$%ume that it would taste very similar) .I didnt say anything cause I didnt want to be rude, so we got the rest of the junk from DQ and left.<br>
<br>
Game 6, My light vs Mickeys Ralops with bikers.<br>
I set up EBO, and he flipped Ralops. He drained for four, but I drained for more. Then he dropped Zuckuss and Dengar in ships and I ran away. he followed. This time I dropped more x-wings along with cannons and shot the Mist Hunter out of the sky. So it was many x-wings vs the Punishing One, I won that fight.... So now Im way ahead in force so I set up a few more drains and sat. I did all wings report in to boost reduce my lost pile, and held epp obi and luke along with a gift of the mentor to do some damage to a lonely biker, but he drew up before I could.<br>
<br>
Highs:Shooting the Mist Hunter and raping the punishing one<br>
Lows: Never got to beat up a biker.<br>
<br>
So the tourney ends, and i managed to take first. Rob got second and Mickey took 3rd. It was a pretty fun day. Later there was a demo of some war hammer like game that seemed to suck, and i returned to DQ where I bought some nasty tasting ice cream that i ended up throwing in the air to see it splatter all over the ground, I should have takin my own advice, and not purchased anything with ice cream in it but oh well.<br>
<br>
