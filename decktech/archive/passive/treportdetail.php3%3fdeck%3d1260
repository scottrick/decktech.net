decided that missing a day of work was worth, Blockbuster has enough employees<br>
anyway. Brad picked me up and we arrived at Krier&amp;#8217;s early enough for him to set stuff up.<br>
We walk in and theres Peter Nordstrom putting the finishing touches on his decks. I end<br>
up playing a couple of games before we got underway with the first round.<br>
<br>
Game One: My Light Vs. Charles Palmer&amp;#8217;s BHBM troopers (WTF)<br>
	Alright, well I&amp;#8217;ve played against this deck before in play testing and it was<br>
something I was definitely afraid of. Charles is a fun person to play,btw his new nick name is Wort. Ok, well enough about<br>
the player and on to the game. So he starts the BHBM stuff and puts out mobilization<br>
points, IAO, and A legion of my finest troops. Well the game starts off with everything<br>
working in my favor I get in some early battles against some troopers and think that I&amp;#8217;m<br>
doing alright when he drops troopers every where and starts to drain me.  He put Mara<br>
Jade at the Home One war room and grabbed her saber. I throw the numbers card to grab<br>
honor to stop that drain, and take my turn. I end up pulling Jedi Luke from reserve deck<br>
and dropping him on Jade, that pretty much did nothing, I drew a one for destiny and he<br>
ended up hitting Luke. I made him lose a couple of trooper assaults to a lost monnok, but<br>
I wasn&amp;#8217;t doing any major damage. He kept putting out troopers and dropping a Cadet at<br>
every site to soak up any damage. After he beat me off all ground sites I managed to stay<br>
in the game by sending Jedi Luke from my lost pile to do hit and run attacks against his<br>
troopers. I put out  battle plan to make him pay for drains his drains and Draw  their fire<br>
in order to retrieve some. I would initiate for free and swing at his cadet to get rid of<br>
them. After about 10 of these battles I finally did him in.<br>
FW(+5)<br>
2(+5)<br>
<br>
Game Two: My dark Vs. Charles Palmer&amp;#8217;s EBO <br>
	Yeah well it looks like I get to play against Charles again. This game I decided was pretty much over from the second I heard the match up. I&amp;#8217;ve also played against this deck before so I knew what to expect. He started superficial damage, squadron assignments, and I think the numbers card. I set up my ties and tried to find vader to make him lose force from Your Destiny, but I never end up finding him until the last couple of turns. The game pretty much ended when he lost EBO from the top of his reserve deck.I won by draining him out.<br>
FW(+19)<br>
4(+24)<br>
<br>
Game Three: My Light versus Kevin Shannon&amp;#8217;s Abybissans from hell<br>
	AARRRRGGGGGGGG!!!! This game was soooo long, but if you&amp;#8217;ve ever played<br>
against Kevin you already know this. Well he starts off with combat readiness for the<br>
cantina and the audience chamber and deploys some abybissian&amp;#8217;s down to the audience<br>
chamber, he drops Tattoine and puts out Intensify the foward batteries. Just then Brad<br>
walks by and tells him that you have to occupy a battle ground system in order to deploy<br>
an admirals order. After we ask everyone in the tournament about it Kevin and I decide to<br>
screw it and keep playing. His next turn he ends up dropping  Zuckuss in mist hunter and<br>
a abybissian and drops Myo down to the Audience chamber along with dropping his Ao.<br>
So, I&amp;#8217;m thinking yeah so there crapping little aliens. WRONG! I spend most of the game<br>
trying to beat on these damn annoying aliens. I end up winning some early battles but he<br>
Abyssian ornaments and used scum and villainy to retrieve most of his lost pile, after<br>
finally getting rid of his damn s&amp;v&amp;#8217;s I ended the game by nabruning Jedi Luke to a lone<br>
abyssians site.<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing Kevin again, and finally beating him.<br>
Lows: None it was a great game.<br>
<br>
Fw(+22)<br>
6(+46)<br>
<br>
Game Four Dark Vs. Robert Selby&amp;#8217;s Training<br>
	Well this is only the second time I&amp;#8217;ve played Rob in a tournament. Before this I<br>
game was 1-0 against him. He starts MWYHL stuff and Battle Plan, The Way of Things,<br>
and Wise Advice, and I start the usual. So the game starts off with me setting up a tie at<br>
walklieemi with a presence to start the drains off early while I put up the emperor at the<br>
D*2 docking bay for activation. He takes his turn and ends up putting out like five cards.<br>
He starts by saying that he&amp;#8217;s looking for a dagobah location and ends up grabbing Son of<br>
Skywalker, Yoda, Luke&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, a site, and Jedi test 1. He drops another site and<br>
tells me to go. So, now I&amp;#8217;ll skip to the interesting parts of the game.(side note:that last<br>
statement was a complete lie, there were no interesting parts of this game,in fact except<br>
when he happened to get lucky and out of commission a vader that he killed this game<br>
was tiring) All game I controlled space with one or two ties at Kiffex, Endor, Sullust,<br>
Kashyyyk, and Walklieemi with a presence draining the hell out of him. He retrieved his<br>
10 after flipping on his 8th or 9th turn and I drained it back out on my next turn. After<br>
flipping and stacking a two on his objective(LOL!) He finally decides to come to the D*2<br>
docking bay to try and kill the emperor with Jedi Luke and his saber and obi one and his<br>
saber. So I&amp;#8217;m thinking that I might actually get some cards in my lost pile when he On the<br>
edges Obi and names a five, I&amp;#8217;m like WTF. He ends up drawing something lower and<br>
there goes obi. I always love it when my opponent decides to kill his own characters. That<br>
pretty much ended the game I attacked Luke and sacked Emperors power to get another<br>
destiny to kill him and drained him out.<br>
<br>
FW(14)<br>
8(+60)<br>
<br>
Highs:Winning<br>
Lows:Him making desperate mistakes<br>
<br>
Well at this point I&amp;#8217;m feeling pretty happy with myself, I&amp;#8217;ve earned some respect with the<br>
locals and have beaten Kevin who I&amp;#8217;ve been after ever since I met him. From this point on<br>
my performance falters a little.<br>
<br>
Game Five: My Dark Vs. Peter Nordstroms&amp;#8217;s Hidden Base<br>
	Well I don&amp;#8217;t remember much about this game. All I know is that in the beginning I<br>
was doing all right setting up the Emperor at his throne room and setting up some steady<br>
drains when it all turned around. Through out the game he had been amassing a large<br>
space fleet consisting of most of the new ships including wedge and Gen. Calrissian. For<br>
the remainder of the game he beat the hell out of my ties. He just had too much forfeit on<br>
his ships with Insurrection out.<br>
	<br>
FL(-3)<br>
8(+57)<br>
<br>
Highs: Doing alright against a great player, and losing aginst him by the lowest<br>
diferential.<br>
Lows: None really besides the obvious.<br>
<br>
Game 6: My light Vs. Paul Feldman&amp;#8217;s Set Your Course.<br>
	Well this game I really don&amp;#8217;t remember. I know Paul&amp;#8217;s playing style pretty well<br>
from play testing but he still beats me down every time I play him. I start by setting up the<br>
General in his ship and try to play it safe but after lateral damages and everything else I<br>
was done for. <br>
<br>
FL(-25)<br>
8(+32)<br>
<br>
Highs:  None really<br>
Lows: Losing to Paul again.<br>
<br>
Well overall a great tournament with an all right turnout. Peter ended up taking the<br>
tournament going undefeated and prize support was great with everyone getting at least<br>
two packs of D*II and extras provided by Krier&amp;#8217;s cards. <br>
