Tatooine Region (Phoenix)<br>

Hello All!!<br>
<br>
   Well, it&#146;s been a long time since I&#146;ve last played in a Star Wars tournament. Although I have been running a good number of tournaments recently, I haven&#146;t playing in a Tucson tournament since the beginning of the summer. So I decided to drive up to Phoenix this weekend and test my luck. I&#146;ve been getting lucky while play testing two new decks so I thought I&#146;d give it a real test.<br>
<br>
   The tournament was at a new location this weekend. The Gamer&#146;s Edge is a new store in the area, and from what I saw it&#146;s going to be regular stop in the Star Wars scene in Phoenix.<br>
<br>
LS - Yavin 4 Mains<br>
DS - Ralltiir Operations<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
DS vs. Brett &quot;Just Bring It&quot; Kitani<br>
<br>
   Well, this wasn&#146;t exactly the opening pairing I was hoping for. Brett is the highest rated player in Arizona, and #5 in the region. Oh well, I did beat him once (He was playing a Jawa Sabacc deck) so I know that anything can happen. Brett started with Yoda&#146;s Hut, Staging Area, Insurrection, and You Insight Serves You Well. I started with Ralltiir Operations, Imperial Arrest Order, Imperial Decree and You Cannot Hide Forever.<br>
<br>
   I had a pretty good starting hand with 2 sites, Kashyyyk and Security Precautions. First turn, he deploys Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight to the Home One: Docking Bay. I was able to flip my objective second turn, but because of the beat down fear I moved everyone to the Swamp. Next turn Twas Khaa deploys to the forest, and Luke moves to his just deployed Docking Bay on Ralltiir. (My objective flips back.) Mara Jade, and 4-Lom w/ battle Luke while Bubo harasses Twas Khaa but doesn&#146;t do any damage. (Brett, I really think you need more 0&#146;s in that deck.) Daughter of Skywalker deployed to the Tatooine Docking Bay while Ben Kenobi and another LS, JK made the transit to Ralltiir. Zuckuss in Mist Hunter was draining Kashyyyk, but was eventually scared away by Home One. Mara Jade with her saber fought Ben Kenobi and Twas Khaa at the Docking Bay while Igar in Tempest 1 fought Daughter of Skywalker. <br>
<br>
   But in the end, Brett had more mains than I could handle. DOS joined her brother in Skywalking over the Dark Lord in the forest. Full loss by 17.   0 (-18)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
LS vs. Brett Kitani (Again!!! I have to up my payoffs to Brandon I guess.)<br>
<br>
   Well, I gave my DS deck its shot, I might as will see if my LS deck is up to the challenge. Brett was playing Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi with Crush the Rebellion, Imperial Arrest Order and You Cannot Hide Forever. I had Yavin 4: Throne Room, the Farm and the Swamp.<br>
<br>
   First turn I was able to deploy the Jundland Wastes, Mos Eisley and a Nudj to the Farm from the Swamp. Brett deployed Mara Jade to the Throne Room. Leia w/ deployed to the Meditation Chamber and moved to the Holotheater to cancel Visage. The Dark Lord of the Sith joined MJ in the Throne Room and moved to the Farm with Presence of the Force there. (Flipping his objective.)  I deployed another Nudj there from the Swamp, but I didn&#146;t have Luke or Ben yet to flip the objective back. During is control phase, Vader became Lost in the Wilderness and the objective flipped back. Mara Jade went to the Farm to find him, but Melas and Han w/ stopped her thanks to an unexpected Demotion. Han moved to the Swamp to drain. One of the Emperor&#146;s henchman (I don&#146;t remember which one) came to look for Vader. I deployed Luke w/, but I didn&#146;t battle. Instead I moved Han over and I prepared for the battle. He was able to draw the 5 to find Vader and deployed the other henchman. During my turn I played Sorry about the Mess to get rid of Vader and the battle left only Han standing.<br>
<br>
   Vader w/ appeared at the Casino, but Obi-wan with his Lightsaber and Threepio clear him away from there too. (Unfortunately he also cleared them away.) Again Vader came to the Casino and this time he has friends so I wasn&#146;t able to get rid of him. I deployed Luke Skywalker, Jedi and Anakin&#146;s saber to the Cantina but IG-88 and Jabba the Hutt came calling. I should have played Clash of Sabers as soon as IG-88 was deployed but I didn&#146;t and I paid for it. He captured Luke and the battle was over. Ben cleared away Jabba, but couldn&#146;t get IG-88. Eventually it became a drain race with him draining for 6 on Cloud City while I was draining for 7 all over the place. But I was spread too thin, and Djas Puhr beat up on a lone Momar Nadon. Another loss, but this time by only 13.   0 (-30)<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs. Mike Sinclair&#146;s There is Still Good In Him deck.<br>
<br>
   I made this Dark Side deck after learning from Mike at the Tatooine Regional in July. Hopefully I will be able to take what he taught me and for it to good use here. This was the first I&#146;ve seen of the new objective so I wasn&#146;t sure how to play against it. He started with (A lot!!!) the Objective and it&#146;s stuff. And he also started with Squadron Assignments, Do or Do Not, and I think Strike Planning. (It might have been Staging Area or something.) I started with my usual Ralltiir start.<br>
<br>
   I decided that a quick flip wasn&#146;t beneficial if you end up having to move everyone to one site afterwards, so I decided to go a little slower this time. I waited and was able to flip my objective around the 3rd turn with Marquand @ the Jungle, an AT-ST pilot in Tempest Scout 1 at the Swamp and Officer Evax at the Forest. In the meantime, Luke had moved to the Endor Landing Platform, Orrimaarko was at the Back Door and Captain Han was in the Falcon at Kiffex. I had 4-LOM w/ in my hand but I couldn&#146;t find Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. I had to settle for Mara Jade instead. Gold Leader in Gold 1 and Fig&#146;rin D&#146;an joined Han while Orrimaarko and Luke each moved one site over. Mara Jade and 4-LOM w/ battled Orrimaarko at Chirpa&#146;s Hut. Obi Wan w/ came down later but he missed the swing and drew an unfortunate low destiny so Mara Jade survived. He then moved Luke over to have MJ capture him and flip his objective. Next turn, I deploy Search and Destroy, the Dark Lord and another 4-LOM w/ deployed to the Back Door and MJ moves Luke over to avoid the Force loss. He deployed Leia w/ to battle the lone Evax, but TS 1 &#146;react&#146;ed over to help out.<br>
<br>
   Eventually my drains and Search and Destory were to much for him. Mike sent a suicide Bothan after me to end the game. Full win by 14.   2 (-16)<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
LS vs. Mike Sinclair (okay Brandon I&#146;ll doubling my weekly payoffs!!)<br>
<br>
   Well, I pulled off the lucky win last game, maybe I can do it again. Mike was playing with Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi (Dueling). He also started with Imperial Arrest Order, Crush the Rebellion and You Cannot Hide Forever. I started with my Yavin 4 setup as usual.<br>
<br>
   Unfortunately, there wasn&#146;t very much I could do my first turn so I deployed a Nudj and Obi Wan&#146;s Hut. We traded Visage losses for a couple of turns and then Vader came to Obi-Wan&#146;s Hut with thanks to Presense of the Force. I had Obi-Wan, his lightsaber, Chewie w/, and some interrupts I hoped to use to beat up on Vader with. Unfortunately, and as soon as Obi-Wan came down he dueled. I tried to Sense it, but my destiny was too high. So Obi-Wan loses the close duel along with 9 Force and it was all down hill from there. Vader had a solid drain of 5 and there was nothing I could do about it. Eventually, I got Cracken and Chewie w/ at the Holotheater and Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight with Anakin&#146;s saber to the Cloud City Docking bay but it wasn&#146;t fast enough. Full loss by 20.   2 (-36)<br>
<br>
Well, I came to the deep end of the pond, and I got whompped by the big fish. But it was still good to get to play in a tournament again. I want to thank Brett and Mike for 4 great games. (I only wish I could have put up a better fight.) Thank you to Brandon for directing the event. Thank you to Gamer&#146;s Edge for hosting the tournament and thank you for the sandwiches that was really cool of you. And thank you for all the other Phoenix players I got to see and talk to (even those on the phone) today. I hope to see you all at a tournament soon.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah I almost forgot... Brett Kitani won the tournament with a tough last game win against Mike Girard. I finished second to last and won a Reflection Pack (Bossk) and a set of Third Anthology cards.<br>
