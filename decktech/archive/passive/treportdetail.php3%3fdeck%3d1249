<br>
I wasn&#146;t real psyched up for this one, I just wasn&#146;t happy with either deck.  I only play-tested my light side one a few times, and I just threw my DS one together about Wed.  I had no idea how they would do, but I figured that the last couple of tournaments I&#146;ve went to, I have struggled and thought that I was prepared, so I couldn&amp;#8217;t do any worse.  So me and my new, untested decks hopped in the car with my sister (who plays) and buddy and headed out.<br>
<br>
Game 1:  My LS vs. Chris Warder&#146;s (1683) Tat ground deck<br>
For LS, I took a Quiet Mining Colony deck revolving around cloud draining.  I wasn&#146;t very optimistic with it, but what the heck.  I started pulling sites with the obj and put down a couple of cloud cars at Bespin: CC and Lando &amp;  EPP Han at the Casino.  Chris put down Tat: JP, JP: AC and the Moisture Farm (I think) and that was it.  He came at Han and Lando with Tempest 1 and Lord Vader.  He won the first battle by a few cards.  I got a couple ships at Bespin, so at least I had a little drain.  He was draining for 3 and so was I.  I reinforced with EPP Leia and he put somebody else down as well.   I threw down an All My Urchins in hopes of avoiding battle for a couple of turns, but he altered it and we fought  3 or 4 times at the same site.  I finally just tried to spread out and hurt him as much as possible, but the fights had taken their toll.  <br>
<br>
Full Loss:  0(-23)<br>
Overall:  0(-23)<br>
<br>
Good:  Flipping early.  It helped out with what draining, I did have.  Also taking Vader&#146;s saber with CC Sabacc.<br>
Bad:  Wishing I&#146;d given up the Casino and tried to battle him at one of his Tat sites.<br>
<br>
Game 2:  My DS vs. Will Dean&#146;s (1462) Kessel Run deck<br>
I just made this deck on Wed, it was a Walker Garrison deck with heavy space protection.  I started the Ice Plains and Defense Perimeter.  Will started Bothawui.  I got great draws the first couple of turns and pulled almost all of my sites by turn 3.  Will put down ECC Chewie by himself at the Defense Perimeter.  I put out an Ice Storm to move Chewie inside while I waited to get some walkers.  Will had started Battle Plan so he didn&#146;t drain the one turn he had a chance for 2.  I got some walkers and deployed an Imp Walker and Blizzard 2 to the DB where Chewie was and battled.  I took him out plus a few cards, and then moved out to set up the Garrison.  Will deployed a bunch of ships to Kessel, but never drained, because of the low activation he was getting.  I was getting about 15-16 a turn, so I was putting out whatever I could.  I set up Admiral Chiranaeu on the Thunderflare at Hoth with IG88 in IG2000 and Bossk in Hound&#146;s Tooth.  I spread out the walkers on Hoth, and while Will was trying to pull off a Kessel Run, I drained him for 12 two turns in a row with Walker Garrison.  The next turn, I was able to take him out with just the drains at the system and sites I controlled.<br>
<br>
Full Win:  2(+35)<br>
Overall:  2(+12)<br>
<br>
Good:  Being ready for most anything by the time she got setup.<br>
Bad:  Taking so long to get out my characters.  I never did get out my Tat Occ.  <br>
<br>
Game 3:  My DS vs. Chris Warder&#146;s (1683) Dantooine Base Ops<br>
Well, just great!  Not only did I have to play one of the best players here, but I had to play him twice!  After my last game with my DS I was a little more confident with it than I had been the first time I had played Chris.  I started the same as last game, and he pulled the swamp, and a couple of &lt;&gt; sites and flipped on turn 3 or 4.  I had the Hoth system out already, and was a little concerned that he would try to over take it.  I had a couple of ships in hand, but nothing stout enough to get the job done.  I put Mara w/stick down on the defense perimeter and Dr. E for support and started small draining.  He put down an X-wing squadron on Hoth and I finally got my ships before he could drain.  I put down Thunderflare w/Chiraneau and Ozzel and then IG88 in IG2000 and battled.  I won and forfeited Ozzel for attrition.  He lost his squadron and 5 or 6 cards.  Next turn he came to the Perimeter with Daughter and her pistol and some 2-2 scout (Greeves maybe).  I had shuttled Dr. E up as a pilot on the last turn, so Mara was by herself.  He missed with the pistol, and I chopped up Daughter.  He lost them both, and Mara remained.  I had also put out Insignificant Rebellion, just to get the added loss.  He deployed Blount and Cracken to the 6th marker, and I left him alone for a while.  I started deploying walkers to Mara&#146;s site, and marching them to the Ice Plains.  He deployed DS2 Wedge, Gen Lando and a couple of scrubs to back them up.  I marched over with DLOTS and Tarkin in Blizzard 2 and an Imp walker.  I battled, and we canceled each other&amp;#8217;s destiny.  I won by a couple, and he lost one of the scrubs and 1 for the Insignificant Rebellion.  I backed up Vader and Tarkin with 4-LOM w/gun and canceled Wedge&#146;s txt then battled again and won.  It took me until then to get on 3 sites to pull off the Garrison.  I did it, but he only lost 7.  I needed to cancel out Honor to get an extra 2 for the next time, so I deployed Admiral Piett on an Imp Walker to Dantooine.  Next turn, I did him in without the Garrison.<br>
<br>
Full Win:  2(+11)<br>
Overall:  4(+23)<br>
<br>
Good:  Being able to win all of the battles.<br>
Bad:  Not getting out my sites to make the Garrison really hurt.  <br>
<br>
Game 4:  My LS vs. Chad Reedy&#146;s (1478) SYCFA<br>
I was nervous about this one as soon as I saw the objective.  I was expecting SFS TIE&#146;s and didn&#146;t figure to fair vary well against it.  I started deploying sites and was waiting until I knew I could hold something down before I deployed.  He played a 2nd turn Monnok and got 3 of my 4 CC Sabaccs.  I got out EPP Han and Leia out at the Casino, but now I didn&#146;t have any reason to stay there.  I got the Falcon and Lando into hand, and used Squadron Assignments to get Chewie.  I put them at Bespin.  He tried to look for a DS site 3rd turn and it wasn&#146;t there, so I got to look at his hand.  He didn&#146;t have more than 2 ships in his whole deck!  It was a manipulator deck, and a pretty mean one from the looks of it.  I instantly changed my strategy in my head and started looking for my ships.  He altered about everything I played out.  I finally got Tantive and used Red Squadron 1 to pull Wedge.  I deployed them to the Death Star and started draining for 3.  I had a couple of cloud cars, but I kept worrying about a Monnok, so as fast as I would draw one, I&#146;d deploy it.  He wasn&#146;t draining me anywhere.  He had all the 1/0 DB&amp;#8217;s out and a couple of Imps out to make his Mob Points work.  He was activating 15 on turn 3.  I switched the Falcon and Red Squadron 1 and then put RliR1 to back up Wedge at Bespin.  I had knocked him back on the 2 battles we had on CC, and I could now see that I just needed to play smartly and wait until my drains did the work.  The DS drain was huge for me.  I had been burnt in the last tournament by that missed opportunity.<br>
<br>
Full Win:  2(-17)<br>
Overall:  6(+40)<br>
<br>
Good:  Being able to change plans on the fly.  <br>
Bad:  Never getting to play sabacc.<br>
<br>
I was figuring that I had done pretty well, and I was eager for the final standings.  There were a couple of games still going on and we had to wait a little.  <br>
The final results came, and I got 2nd.  That is my best finish so far!  I have been on cloud nine ever since!<br>
<br>
Thanks to Mark Bordenet for another fine tournament!<br>
<br>
While I&#146;m sorry that our defending State Champ, John Tatta (1771), had to leave due to illness(from the sounds of it, you need to learn how to party dude!), I am glad for the opportunity to finish well.  He had to drop out after the 2nd game.  It would have been different if he&#146;d stayed.<br>
<br>
