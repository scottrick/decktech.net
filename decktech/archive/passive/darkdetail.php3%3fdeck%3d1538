This will greatly enhance the forfeit value of most of your characters, protect you from Nabrun (and therefore, Mains and Toys) and enable you to get lots of battlegrounds, especially the two rebel base docking bays (for Imperial Decree).<br>
<br>
If you want, you should be able to quickly flip the objective (normally turn 2), by getting a rebel base docking bay each turn, deploying an agent at each on turn two and then transitting them together if need by (to protect from retaliation).<br>
After your objective has been flipped, use the rest of your docking bays for quick 2-force drains and for modifying your opponents drains (simply search for the corresponding docking bay via IAO, deploy an ISB there, voilá, force drains -1 at related locations. The two Spaceport Docking Bays cover any planet you don't have an appropriate docking bay for...). Combine this with Imperial Decree and you can shut down most of your opponents drains or be drained for only one. <br>
The Walkers protect you from Beatdown and Undercover spies (Trample, squish...) and can be quickly transferred to where they are needed most via docking bay transit. Commander Igar is included twice because of his ability to add a battle destiny if piloting one of the Walkers in this deck (except Blizzard 2).<br>
There is only a token space force, however I doubt this deck would need a larger fleet.<br>
Endor Occupation: This card is mainly there because of the small space force. If someone tries to retrieve force with a celebration (Come here YBC! usually won't cancel that), just crash the party. Otherwise, it's a recyclable 5er destiny.<br>
Since this deck can usually win a good portion of ground-based battles, Empire's New Order is included. It's simply great against Ewoks and Operative decks.<br>
<br>
Vs. Hidden Base: Try to get the ISB Ops running as quickly as possible to modify their drains by -1 (search for the docking bays as appropriate). Then use the Twi'lek Advisors to search for Security Precautions and try to find their base...<br>
<br>
Vs MWYHL: I would really consider using Broken Concentration as your starting interrupt, since it will really slow down a training deck. Other than that, spread out and drain as much (and quickly) as you can. Keep a reserve force handy in case your opponent tries to occupy two battlegrounds to retrieve force (CHYBC!)<br>
<br>
Vs. Revolver: Get the rebel base docking bays and the Imperial Decree out as quickly as possible to nullify the effects of Revolution. Since most of your locations sport an equal amount of light and dark side icons, you won't lack force...<br>
<br>
Vs Operatives: You should usually be able to take them head on. Trample the operatives, kill the rest (maybe a bit too simplified, but since their drains will be at -1, and yours at +1, they will have a hard time...)<br>
<br>
I haven't yet tried this deck out against all the different types of different light side decks, however, I think it would be able to beat a fair share of them...<br>
<br>
