<br>
With the release of Crush the Rebellion, it is now possible for the Dark Side to construct an effective force choke deck.  Since all prior attempts to do this hinged on the use of 2/0 locations, all these decks were vulnerable to revolution.  With CTR, you can force choke the LS freely.  Ironically, it works best against a nudj revolver deck!<br>
<br>
I know you're thinking about the fact that the deck has no battlegrounds.  That's crucial and it works.  Read on.<br>
<br>
You start with ISB ops and the Couruscant system, whose text you will use later.  Your early game objectives are threefold:  first, draw up an get some locations.  You're gonna need the force.  While you do this, figure out what the opponent is playing.  You'll also want to get a Broken Concentration into your hand as soon as you get the opportunity.  Once you have force and Broken Conc, deploy it and start moving back a force every turn.  You should have so much activation that this is a good play.  Don't do it until you have superior activation, or you're hurting yourself.  Now see what the LS does.  If they put out a battleground, dominate it with Vader and Walkers or heavy ships.  Don't rush to flip the objective!  That will come with time.  <br>
<br>
As you take control of the LS battlegrounds, you'll soon deploy enough ISB agents to flip and boost your drains.  If they don't give you a battleground, get a star destroyer to couruscant and add a POTF there to drain for 2.  Conceivably you could POTF the Imperial Square, put an agent there, and drain for 2 at both Coruscant and the square; the LS can't deploys ships to couruscant or rebels to the Square when you do this.   This can be a useful late game tactic or just an emergency measure.  Soon the LS will try to invade your 2/0 locations.  That's when CHYBC comes down and stops them cold.  Now they have to deploy battlegrounds for you to control/drain.  If you can, try to trap EPP Han at an interior 2/0 using Imperial Arrest Order.  <br>
<br>
Once you establish yourself and start drains, you can 5D6 another location where they try to drain.  Retrieve you agents as you can.  If they come to space, a Lateral Damage can crush them.  The Point man is for Order to Engage, which can be problematic when the EPP squad comes around.  The homing beacon will help make sure your couruscant drains don't get landing clawed.  Crush the Rebellion makes it safe to leave Agents with Vader, and can also be a useful measure for looking through your deck or checking out a destiny draw when you activate all your force.  Against odds, you can use it to shuffle all the time, even in mid-activation.  The deck is excellent against any kind of Throne Room/careful planning start, since the nudjs won't stop deployment of your spies.  Soon the Nudjs will be dead and you'll have 2 more forde plus 2 battlegrounds to dominate.  It stops Ops cold with bright center/5D6.  Hidden Base can be problematic, especially if it is HBX.  Just get out a security precautions and try to use your enormous activation advantage and the lateral damage to smash them in battle.  Retrieving forfeited agents can help keep you going for a long time.  Against EPPs you can battle or run and drain.  Again, 5D6 will help you alot.<br>
<br>
I played this deck in the Gauntlet tournaments and team championship at Deciphercon, going 4-0 with it and defeating a former worlds qualifier.  It's pretty solid.  Let me know what you think.<br>
