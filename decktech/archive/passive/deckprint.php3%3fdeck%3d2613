Responsibility of Command needs to deploy on the war room and it doesn't allow the rebel to initiate a battle <br>
or force drain where present.  Much anger in him makes him lose 4 force if he doesn't battle and you had presence <br>
there.  Relentless tracking makes them lose 3 force if your biker scout is at the same location as them.  There are<br>
5 biker scouts in the deck, you should get one early.  Make sure you have some anti SAC out before you deploy the <br>
effects.  You have oppresive enforcement, there is no try, 3 controls, and a grabber(grab the alter).  Point Man <br>
cancels Order to Engage, you don't want your strategy to hurt you too.  The sites have pretty good drain potential, <br>
even though you don't really need it.  Don't go into space early.  Only go up for a quick hit battle and to probe.<br>
the three twileks should get all of your effects out pretty quick. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech SW: CCG <BR> Play With Power <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR>
