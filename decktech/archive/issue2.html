            <p>Preparing for the regional qualifiers Team DeckTech Style.</p>
            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>Wouldn’t you like to have a better chance at winning the World 
              Championship this year? If the answer is yes then you should consider 
              DeckTech Tournament Training Teams. We've got a fast track way to 
              prepare you to be the best you can be for your upcoming qualifier 
              but it’s not going to be easy. You will have to join one of the 
              Tournament Teams and communicate with people from all over the world 
              to hone your skills. Before I get ahead of myself lets take a step 
              back at look at why so many people do poorly at qualifier events.</p>
            <p>Peak Performance Phenomenon</p>
            <p>You’re the best in your area in fact you’re so good you don’t even 
              have much competition anymore. So you go to a qualifier and expect 
              to do well but for some reason you do lousy. Why? </p>
            <p>I think this is because players that come from a small tournament 
              scene tend to reach a plateau in their performance after they reach 
              the top of the pack. While other players in more competitive areas 
              find it tougher to win and try harder to get better and better, 
              thus though they might not win as many tournaments as the former 
              player their capacity to grow as a SW: CCG player is not hindered 
              through lack of competition. </p>
            <p>There are also the factors of your local meta not adequately preparing 
              you for a event as broad as the qualifiers. If you live in a very 
              competitive area then you are fortunate not to have to worry as 
              much about these issues. But for those of you that live in low competition 
              areas you are going to have to work extra hard to prepare for your 
              regional events.</p>
            <p>Here are some Items you will need to know in order to prepare for 
              your regional.</p>
            <dir> 
              <p>1.&#9;What are the best decks on either side and how do you counter 
                them.</p>
              <p>2.&#9;What decks can you expect to see a lot of </p>
              <p>3.&#9;Which Decks will you play and how will you play them to 
                counter the above decks</p>
              <p>4.&#9;What are common mistakes you can make at the regional events? 
                How do you prevent them?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </dir>
            <p>To answer these questions the staff of Team DeckTech has decided 
              to set up Tournament Teams. ‘Team DeckTech I’ will consist of the 
              first 2 people from each region that submit their information and 
              agree to the Team DeckTech guidelines. These players will network 
              together to find the answers to the above questions. By networking 
              with people outside of your region you can communicate openly with 
              people about your play testing, tournament, and other experiences 
              and help each other to overcome the Peak Performance Phenomenon 
              without worrying about facing those same people at a qualifier. 
              The reason that there are two from each region is simple, to increase 
              the probability that members from Team DeckTech qualify and provide 
              you an opportunity to get a friend to join a team with you so that 
              you can practice with them in relative privacy.</p>
            <p>Each team will have a Team Captain that person will enforce the 
              Tournament Team Guidelines. If you fail to keep the Team Guidelines 
              you will be removed from the team and your spot will open up to 
              be filled by someone else in your region. </p>
            <p>This might sound harsh but this system is designed to help people 
              win. This is for serious players those players that are serious 
              should not be penalized by someone who is not. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here are the Tournament Team Guidelines.</p>
            <dir> 
              <p>1.&#9;Information, strategy, deck ideas, theories and other on 
                topic SW: CCG related information that you receive from one of 
                the other Team Members shall not be disclosed to anyone not in 
                your specific team unless given specific permission from the author(s).</p>
              <p>2.&#9;There are no Tournament Team Lurkers. You will participate 
                by communicating, designing, play testing, and reporting your 
                findings to the entire team regularly.</p>

            <p>As this is just the second edition of deck tech card review, i'll 
              sum up what's going on here. Players send me reviews of a specified 
              card. I compilate, review, try to draw some conclusions, and factor 
              in my own feelings on the card. I'll then write my review, follow 
              by a reprint of all the reviews sent in. I will try not to repeat 
              too much stuff that is said in others, other than to summarize. 
              At the end, i'll try to think up some cards that could be useful 
              with the reviewed card. Thanks for reading, hopefully, we can get 
              some good ideas out of all this.</p>

            <p>Note from Editor. The card reviews will now be based on a 5 star 
              rating loosely adapted from the Inquest star rating. I like it because 
              it can be defined so well.</p>
            <p>***** Five stars - These are the cards you see in tournaments time 
              and time again. They are the best at what they need to do. They 
              can fit in nearly any deck, and generally have excellent stand-alone 
              value. ex. Darth Vader</p>
            <p>**** Four stars - These are also very good cards, but often are 
              a notch below the quality of a five star card, or lose a lot of 
              effectiveness without supporting cards. Often seen in tournaments, 
              but generally in specific deck types. ex. How did we get into this 
              mess?</p>
            <p>*** Three stars - These are average cards. They may be important 
              in very specific deck types, but generally have few outstanding 
              capabilites and are not often seen in constructed decks, or are 
              used mostly when an expansion first comes out. Often can be useful 
              in a sealed deck. ex. astromech droids.</p>
            <p>** Two stars - A poor quality card. They are either too slow, too 
              expensive, or have some kind of prohibitive drawback that makes 
              them not very useful. Often there are other cards that fulfill similar 
              functions, but much better. Almost never seen in a constructed deck, 
              but in a sealed deck they might make it. ex. Nikto</p>
            <p>* One star - A useless card. Often serves no particular use, or 
              is very easily disrupted. Never seen at tournaments. ex. Ghoel</p>

            <p>Introduction:</p>
            </font></b><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>&#9; The Executor these days seems like a relic from the past; 
              when the empire's high powered vehicles and starships <i>meant </i>something. 
              But nowadays for the price of a blizzard walker, the rebels can 
              deploy a power of 30, and for a star destroyer, a power of 24 with 
              immunity to attrition! Still power 12, immune to attrition &lt; 
              12 is a unique card. So where does it all stand? Well, that's what 
              were going to try to find out.</p>
            <b> 
            <p>Text: </p>
            </b> 
            <p><i>Executor</i> - Imperial Starship. Capital: <i>Super</i>-Class 
              Star Destroyer</p>
            <p>&#9; Destiny Draw 1</p>

            <p>&#9; May add unlimited pilots, passengers, vehicles, and starfighters. 
              Has ship docking &#9; capability. Permanent Pilots provide total 
              ability of 3. Immune to attrition&lt;12.</p>
            <p><b>Summary</b>. </p>
            <p>&#9; So now we have the Executor in a world that has changed. Let's 
              break it down by starting off with the good. First, a number of 
              people commented on the unlimited pilot ability. Strangely, I have 
              found this to be useless. I don't think I've ever not had extra 
              pilot room when a Star Destroyer was out. So let's move on. With 
              a power of 12 there is no doubt that this ship has some serious 
              mass, but in the current seen mass by itself doesn't hold up, power 
              deploy ratios seem much more important. Take the x-wing, which everybody 
              mentioned. Essentially it boils down to this, for a deploy of 2, 
              you'll get a power of at minumum 3, maximum around 6(s-foils, organized 
              attack). For 8 force, you'll get a power of 20-24 compared to 15 
              force for a power of twelve. Granted 4 cards to 1, but when playing 
              a l.s. space deck, you are more than likely to see the above situation. 
              And when you are looking at powers like that immunity to attrition 
              doesn't really mean anything. Also, even immunity to attrition less 
              than 12 doesn't mean much anymore, with EPP mains on the Falcon+Destiny 
              Adders, another Unit commonly seen in Mains and Toys. Immunity would 
              best be used when all of your starships have some kind of immunity, 
              as in Kuat Drive Yards, or All Power To Weapons. Forfeit 15, now 
              that's nice.</p>
            <p>&#9;Now for the bad, as if the good wasn't bad enough. Hyperspeed 
              of 2. This is just low enough to actually cause trouble. You can 
              easily find yourself stranded, especially if you are just "throwing 
              the executor in there" to fight in space. Destiny of 1, bad, but 
              par for the course. Finally the thing I have always disliked, deploy 
              of 15 force. I hate to play with cards that as a magic friend of 
              mine put it, "You die holding". There are plenty of times when the 
              Executor is undeployable. And an undeployable card is useless.</p>
            <p>&#9;With all that being said, the Executor at times, or in the 
              right decks, can be useful. It's not completely fair to penalize 
              it because the light side cards are so much stronger, as a dark 
              side player you have to compare it to its dark side counterparts, 
              and they are not looking that much better right now. To probe for 
              hidden base, TIE's and ghhks would probably be better, and tallon 
              roll looks strong despite the errata. I think as Mike Fitzgerald 
              put it, it's best use might be as a "home run swing"(excellent phrase). 
              Try to monnok out any barriers, grimtaashs, etc, and throw down 
              on a lone x-wing. It's just enough to keep the opponent from getting 
              sloppy, and if he does you could really punish him. But it's going 
              to cost A LOT of force!</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b>: The Executor is too slow, and too easily outclassed 
              by opponents space fleet. It's drawbacks are ugly, and it's benefits 
              are are not really that powerful.</p>

            <p>I believe the Executor isn't worth a card slot in the tournament 
              scene right now. If your going against a tough opponent they will 
              have a bunch of Superpowered X-Wings that can rip your Super Star 
              Destroyer into a bunch of scrap. The other alternative that is getting 
              more play is the EPPs loaded into the Falcon to get 3 Battle destinies 
              most of which are set and will take down the Executor on attrition. 
              Houjix is becoming increasingly popular and the opponent will take 
              notice when you've got more then 12 Force saved. Also 3 Dreadnaughts 
              are a better buy. They have 2 notches up on destiny , will give 
              you a battle destiny when at the same system , and give you good 
              enough hyperspeed to stay on the move with X-Wings. The ONLY way 
              I see Executor as still getting play is if your trying to play Lateral 
              Damage on a ship and go for a big homerun smack with the Executor 
              , in other words I'd rather have the Bus with Dreadnaughts.</p>

            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>Hi! Here is a review for the next issue of Deck Tech. </p>
            <p>The big bouns however is the fact it has ammunity to attrition 
              less than 12! This means it'll take multiple draws to wipe it out 
              that way.... or some way for the LS to take out it's attrition. 
              It can also add unlimited pilots, passengers, vehicles, and starships. 
              Let's now take a look at how the Dark Side can use this card and 
              then we'll take a look to see how the Light Side can kill it and 
              then lastly, I'll give some cool combos for it. </p>
            <p>&#9; In an all out Dark Side space deck, the Executor can be used 
              as a great strike force or to defend a key system from attack. One 
              of the worst parts of the Executor is it's VERY high deploy. Now, 
              with a new system in Special Edition, that problem has been slightly 
              remedied. If you deploy the Executor at Fondor you can deploy it 
              for only 10 force instead of the normal 15. What if the Light Side 
              takes the system so you can't deploy the Executor? Just deploy another 
              starship, at Fondor, before it and then you will be allowed to deploy 
              it like normal. In a Dark Side deck that's half and half, it can 
              be used as a slight defence for space. If you have pilots in your 
              deck make sure to deploy one with it. In a Dark Side deck that has 
              no space, it can be used to catch your oppent when they least expect 
              it or to probe for the Hidden Base. It used to be that the Executor 
              was very hard to kill with the only reasonable way is to try to 
              get multiple destinys. This proved to be very hard to do as the 
              Dark Side could always put pilots on board to suck up the attrition 
              anyway. In every expansion since Dagobah, there has been one or 
              two more things to help the light side in killing it. Right now 
              there's basically two ways: 1. You can knock out it's attrition 
              by using Direct Assault. The disadvantage to this is that you need 
              to have a starship with a weapon. Still, weapons are useful so this 
              may be the way for you to take it out. 2. You can make him chose 
              between it and lots of force loss. The best way to do this is by 
              getting lots of power 5 (6 with Organized Attack) X Wings and then 
              battling him. Even with just 6 you could make him have to lost it 
              or 18 force! You could also use a power piviot to reduce it's power 
              to 0 and make him lose it AND another 15! </p>
            <p>&#9; Ok here are some cool combos that I've thought of or heard 
              over the net: </p>
            <p>1. Play a Hunt Down and Destory the Jedi/ Space Deck and use Flagship 
              operations. With the advantage of already having two sites down, 
              you should be able to get the others fast by including multiple 
              copies of commander Gerhant. I've found this works pretty well. 
              It works even better when you ust the stratgy below. </p>
            <p>2. Deploy all the Executor sites and use Expand the Empire on the 
              Control Station. Deploy one commander on each of the three sites 
              that now have the Control Stations's text. Do you know what you've 
              just done? You just made the Executor power of 30 without any pilots! 
              In summary, the card is still good just not as good as when it was 
              first created. </p>
            <p>I'd have to give it a 3 star rating. I hope you enjoyed this review!

            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>How does the Executor stack up in the current tournament scene? 
              It doesn't. It has been surpassed by TIE fighters. If you want to 
              effectively take on an opponents armada of x-wings, one power 12 
              ship wont do it. An average x-wing has a power of 6, and is immune 
              to all atrittion. So if they have 4 x-wings, that is already double 
              the Executor. It can be a useful addition to a deck, if you don't 
              expect many Hidden Base x-wing decks. It depends on your area, and 
              the meta. If many people are playing b-wings or x-wings, then i 
              would play TIE's or a DS deck with a few TIE scouts and ghhhks to 
              probe and fall back. If people don't usually play space, it may 
              be a nice addition. If you are playing a Star Destroyer deck, play 
              with it, it is the best SD. It does have a lot of deploy cost. You 
              may have to spend a few turns force on getting this ship out. It 
              also may be a nice addition in a TIE deck, because it can carry 
              unlimited TIES. Another problem with it is that it has a hyperspeed 
              of 2. That is 3 less than an X-wing. You may park it at one of there 
              systems, load it with pilots, and then have them retreat far away 
              next turn. Now you are stuck chasing them. I don't even think it 
              should be played with in most decks in the current play enviroment.</p>

            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>First of all, the Executor's destiny of 1 is not something that 
              you would like to draw for destiny. Second of all, deploy 15 for 
              forfeit 15 and power 12 is not cost effective at all. Third of all, 
              hyperspeed of 2 probably means the Executor won't be moving for 
              a while. Fourth of all, immunity to attrition &lt;12 means that 
              against an X-wing swarm, the Executor won't be lost to attrition, 
              but against an EPP-loaded Falcon, it'll be like wasting 15 Force 
              to cancel a Force drain. Fifth of all, the unlimited capacity is 
              always a good thing. You won't have to worry about having extra 
              pilots in your hand with no starship to put them on. </p>
            <p>Remeber the days when your opponent deployed the Executor and you 
              quivered in fear? Those days are long gone. The Executor does not 
              stack up against LS space. Let's compare stats. To get power 12, 
              the LS can do the following:</p>
            <p>Deploy 2 X-wings, activate S-foils, Play Organized Attack for 5 
              Force. Not only do you have power twelve, you have full immunity 
              to attrition, unlike the Executor's immunity &lt;12. </p>
            <p>For 15 deploy the LS can do the following:</p>
            <p>Deploy 7 X-wings, activate S-foils, play Organized Attack for a 
              massive 42 power!</p>
            <p>Now that I have shown you that the Executor is hardly worth your 
              time. I'll show you some alternatives to using the Executor. For 
              only 15 deploy, you can deploy the following: </p>
            <p>10 TIEs, a Dreadnaught, All Power To Weapons, Tallon Roll to 3 
              systems for power 45 and opponent has around 4 less power. </p>
            <p>To get 12 power, you can deploy the following:</p>
            <p>10 TIEs, a Dreadnaught, All Power To Weapons, Tallon Roll, see 
              above.</p>
            <p>Here is what I rated the Executor:</p>
            <p>Dagobah Era: 9.5 (Admit it that you shivered when it hit the table 
              :-) <br>
              Cloud City Era: 9.0 (Captain Han was the first of many cards that 
              upset the balance.)<br>
              Jabba's Palace Era: 8.5 (Swarms and JP/ETE were simply better that 
              DS space.)<br>
              SE Era: 5.0 (Try out one of my alternatives and you'll see why the 
              TIEs and <br>
              <br>
              Dreadnaught are just, plain better.)</p>
            <p>(editor's note - i'll translate this loosely into a ** star rating 
              )</p>
            <p>In closing, I hope we'll get something in Death Star II to bring 
              strengthen Star Destroyers and limit the power of swarms.</p>

            <p>The Executor. That word strikes fear in the hearts in many a light 
              side SW:CCG player. Should it? Is it all that great? Should it rank 
              among the Dark Side elite, joining such cards as Darth Vader, Boba 
              Fett, Dr. Evazan, etc.? Well read ahead and find out for yourself. 
              Decipher has certainly attempted to make the Executor something 
              of a God among DS starships. It has unlimited capacity for on-board 
              characters, vehicles, and TIEs. It has a supreme attrition immunity 
              of &gt;14. It has its own unique sites for cryin' out loud! Six 
              of 'em! There is no doubt that it is the best DS starship. You could 
              even make an Executor deck! All you need is Flagship ops, Flagship, 
              Fondor, Visage, a few ties, a few imps, and some gimmick objective 
              (ISB Ops or HDADTJ) and you are good to go! Good to go, if you are 
              smart. Don't kid yourself, the Executor is not invincible, far from 
              it! 12 power is actually not that much! 3 souped up X-Wings could 
              beat the hell out of it. The key to playing the Executor wisely 
              is to not rely on it with all of your deck. It is not that hard 
              to take it down so be on the guard. An easy way to get around this 
              is to play with many high-forfiet low-deploy characters and/or TIEs. 
              Keep your Executor at a location that you can quickly evacuate in 
              case the rebels come at you with all they've got. The immunity to 
              attrition means that even if it is alone at a site, it is nigh impossible 
              to get rid of it without some Jedi Test 5-Multiple destiny adder 
              combo (in other words, it is impossible to get rid of). </p>
            <p>The Executor is truely a force to be reckoned with. It is one of 
              the few starships that can be the center of a deck. As with any 
              center of a deck, it must be protected. For example, what good would 
              an EBO deck be without ground defense? Similarly Hidden Base without 
              space defense? With a little defense, the Executor is a menace to 
              light side decks as a whole. Based on this, I give the Executor 
              a 10 out of 10 rating.</p>

            <p>Ok, I wanted to have a good comeback at this tournament as opposed 
              to my 1 win out of 3 a few weeks ago. I decided to bring a variation 
              of Pavlik's "No Shelter" deck off of the listserve(lots of Senses, 
              Revolutions, 3 Obi, 3 Luke, Gift of the Mentor) and a nice ISB spread 
              and drain with Imperial Supplys and many sites on different planets.</p>
            <p>Game 1: My DS vs. Some guy who hadn't been at a tournament before, 
              LS</p>
            <p>I started out quick getting about two sites in my opening hand 
              and then drawing. On his turn he put down some CC sites and played 
              sabaac, which he won. My turn, I use Imperial Supply (lost) and 
              put down some more sites and five agents and flip the objective. 
              I draw and get a SCrew and use it. I get his EPP Luke. He doesn't 
              have anything else that can hurt me. His turn, he draws. My turn, 
              I start saying my drains, and he is surprised they are so much. 
              He had never seen ISB ops before. Well, right now is when </p>
            <p>he figures out he is going to lose. I put down some more sites 
              and agents. His turn he deploys like two different 2/2 guys and 
              battles a lone op. I ghhhk. My turn, I drain him, and he loses his 
              whole hand to my drains. Dumb move, now I know he can't hurt me. 
              Needless to say, the game was over pretty quick.</p>
            <p>Win by 24.</p>

            <p>Game 2: My LS vs. Paul Hegyi's DS (Carbon Chamber Testing, sabaac, 
              lots of ORS)</p>
            <p>This is the person who I really didn't want to play against in 
              this tournament. At the last tournament he spanked me around accounting 
              for two of my losses. Oh well, maybe I can get revenge. Not likely. 
              He began by telling me that he had hardly playtested his deck and 
              he wasn't too confident in it. First turn, he draws. I draw too. 
              Second turn he puts down Jabba the Hutt and an ORS at the Audience 
              Chamber. My turn, I put down Obi-Wan and battle, I draw a 5 for 
              destiny, he doesn't draw high enough to kill Obi, and</p>
            <p>he forfiets both characters. His next turn, down comes Lando and 
              an ORS at the casino and plays CC Sabaac. Sense. I don't think he 
              was expecting that. My turn, down comes Luke Skywalker and Tawss 
              Khaa, I battle, he plays A Real Hero. Sense. This is somewhat a 
              theme of this game. I kill both of his guys. Eventually I get Obi's 
              Saber on him and do some damage force draining at the AC. He gets 
              like four guys down against Luke, I kill two of them. My turn, I 
              dump most of my hand to the used pile, force drain, Nabrun Obi, 
              Sorry About the Mess one of his guys, initiate battle, hit his one 
              guy, play Gift of the Mentor. The total damage is 19. Game Over. 
              Win by 33!</p>
            <p>4(+57)</p>
            <p>Hightlights: Beating the guy who beat me twice last tournament. 
              Having a counter for everything he did. Beating up a lone character 
              for 19 force.</p>
            <p>Lowlights: None!</p>
            <p>Game 3: DS vs. Some Good Player's LS(Hidden Base, Harvest, Beru 
              Stews, Frozen Assets)</p>
            <p>Well, this game didn't go well for me. I started off well, by getting 
              about six sites with agents, but it wasn't enough. He played Frozen 
              Assets just about every turn and Harvested a lot too. Near the end 
              of the game, he played Wars Not Make One Great, so I could only 
              drain a little and what little I could drain he could cancel or 
              retrieve. I had like four force left, and I thought he was going 
              to sit there and keep retrieving with</p>
            <p>Harvest to get like 35 differential, but instead he drained me 
              out. Dumb move for him. Loss by 17.</p>
            <p>4(+40)</p>
            <p>Hightlights: Only losing by 17</p>
            <p>Lowlights: My deck getting dismantled</p>
            <p>Game 4: My LS vs. The Same Guy's DS (Walker Garrison, Sunsdown 
              on Hoth with all those good effects that go with it)</p>
            <p>This one started out slow. I only get two locations out and he 
              gets grimtaashed for his Imperial Walkers. Eventually, I got out 
              Obi and Luke at Obi's Hut and Revolved it, thinking I could win 
              easily from here. Wrong. Imperial Decree. Oh well, it looks like 
              I will have to go and fight him. First I alter his neat </p>
            <p>little Sunsdown effects. Then I Nabrun over and kill a walker or 
              two. I move over to cancel the effects of</p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>Imp. Decree. He puts down Ice 
              Storm. Nooo! This was aweful, considering once my characters are 
              missing I can't deploy any more of them. I Nabrun past the Ice Storm, 
              but soon it comes back for me. This time it gets my Obi and Tawss, 
              so the only characters I have are Luke and Capt. Han. He starts 
              doing the Walker Garrison thing, and my Senses get through about 
              half of the time (can I use Obi for Sense destiny when he is missing?). 
              </font><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size=1>[answer: No, missing 
              characters may not be targeted by other cards unless they specifically 
              target missing characters. See glossary.]</font></b><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
              He only has a little force left, so I put out Cap'n Han on his little 
              ship and drain him out on Hoth. Win by 23</font></p>

            <p>Lowlights: Missing Obi and Tawss in the Ice Storm</p>
            <p>After that last game I was talking to a guy I had played twice 
              and I said that I could have</p>
            <p>destroyed his light side if I had one Hell To Pay in my deck. Then 
              he said he would have</p>
            <p>destroyed my LS with one Do or Do Not in his deck. Oh well. I get 
              second place, an EPP</p>
            <p>of my choice, 2 packs of Special and 2 wb Premiere. All in all, 
              it was a good tournament. </p>

            <p>My LS Deck: Droid Merchants with EPP's (base on a deck posted by 
              Michael Kessling, with very helpful suggestions from Ryan Fojtik).</p>
            <p>My DS Deck: Corulag Operatives with Odds(deck originally created 
              by Bryan Westerby).</p>
            <p>Director: Rick Sollman-Red 55.</p>
            <p>Participants: 11 (5 multi-tournament winners, 4 mid-level players, 
              2 newbies).</p>
            <p>Prizes: Obi-Wan t-shirt for the winner, WB Premiere for other players 
              (no entry fee).</p>
            <p>Dominant Decks: The top 3 players in the tournament all used an 
              incarnation of the "Maelstrom" deck. There was no official ruling 
              before the tournament from Decipher regarding the amount of retrieval 
              allowed with Droid Merchants and one of the players became very 
              upset when the TD ruled that only one </p>
            <p>Force could be retrieved rather than 3 Force. This player became 
              more and more loud and offensive as the tourney progressed and eventually 
              forfeited in the middle of the last game. The TD deserves a lot 
              of credit for keeping his cool in such a volatile situation. A volunteer 
              running a tournament for the benefit of the playing community should 
              not have to deal with verbal abuse of this nature. This player's 
              name is eliminated from game four's results due to these unusual 
              circumstances.</p>
            <p>Most of the winning decks used either one of the Operative Objectives 
              or ISB Operations. The Hidden Base and MWYHL decks did not compete 
              well this week. There was a HDADTJ deck which also did well. The 
              Droid Merchant decks won 5 out of 6 games played, even with the 
              hindered retrieval. Every player with one exception supported the 
              TD's rulings. </p>
            <p>Game 1: DS vs. Ben Hughes(1674) LS Merchant Deck with Surprise 
              Assaults. </p>
            <p>Ben is a 13 year old veteran with a closet full of tourney t-shirts. 
              He is one of the few players to whom I never mind losing, as he 
              always demonstrates the highest degree of character and sportsmanship 
              whenever he plays. I have only beaten him in 2 of maybe 10 tournament 
              games, so I am pretty nervous. </p>
            <p>When I learn that he has a deck similar to my own LS, I regain 
              some confidence, as I had included some counters for this type of 
              deck. Unfortunately, I had removed the Dark Forces from my deck 
              at the last minute, which would have reduced my losses for each 
              Surprise Assault by about 3. My Imperial Trooper Guards were no 
              match for his deck full of Surprise Assaults. </p>
            <p>Full Loss</p>
            <p>0 (-11)</p>
            <p>Highlights: The differential was not too bad.</p>
            <p>Lowlights: Starting off with a loss</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Game 2: LS vs. Jamie ???'s DS Carbon Chamber Testing. </p>
            <p>This game did not start off well for me. That morning, I had replaced 
              Wedge with an extra Obi-Wan, and had to give my opponent EPP Luke 
              at the start of the game. I managed to flip my Objective easily, 
              as my EPP's didn't seem to make it to my hand. I finally found them, 
              and then used Nabrun Leids to move the crew over to the CC:Carbonite 
              Chamber, wiping out lots of little Ugnaughts, and causing an additional 
              Force Loss of 17. Luke was rescued and one more battle at the Audience 
              Chamber ended the game.</p>
            <p>Full Win by 27</p>
            <p>2(+16)</p>
            <p>Highlights: Releasing Luke one turn before he would have been frozen.</p>
            <p>Lowlights: Playing against an unprepared opponent.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Game 3: LS vs. Carl Westerby's (1699) ISB Ops.</p>
            <p>Well, I never look forward to playing my own 12 year old for several 
              reasons. One, I usually lose and two, I still feel bad if I win. 
              Well, I was hoping to qualify for Regionals early, so I playtested 
              my deck in secret all week. He had trouble flipping his Objective 
              as he had both Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin in his </p>
            <p>opening hand. They quickly made mince meat out of the first few 
              characters I had deployed. Fortunately, Chewbacca saved the day 
              as my droids kept going to the Used Pile. Since I start with Draw 
              Their Fire against an ISB Deck, he was unable to Ghhk away the first 
              battle damage I had inflicted. Frozen Assets allowed me to do the 
              same one more time. He drew up before I could retrieve with my Ornament, 
              so I only won by 11.</p>
            <p>4 (+27)</p>
            <p>Highlights: My deck worked just as it should.</p>
            <p>Lowlights: Giving my son his second loss of the day.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Game 4: DS vs. XXXXXXX's(1817) Droid Merchant deck. </p>
            <p>My opponent is the only remaining undefeated player and is a much 
              taller and physically larger </p>
            <p>person than myself. He is also one of the rare players older than 
              myself. Since my DS deck lost the first game, I was just hoping 
              to minimize my losing differential. I didn't realize that I was 
              in contention for one of the top two places, which was fortunate 
              for me, because I would have been very nervous. </p>
            <p>I had tested against this type of deck and expected it to be difficult 
              to beat, even with the 2 TBHTP's I had included. However, I never 
              saw any of the critical cards to a deck like this, such as Hiding 
              In The </p>
            <p>Garbage, Descent Into The Dark, or How Did We Get Into This Mess? 
              This opponent makes it very clear that he wants revenge for the 
              last tournament during which I had beaten his deck. He continues 
              to vocalize his disagreement with the TD's ruling on the Droid Merchant 
              card. My first turn, I was able to deploy 3 characters (every character 
              in my deck is destiny 3) and insert 3,720 To 1. </p>
            <p>This did not help my opponent's mood and it continued to deteriorate 
              when the insert popped up during his next activation. He lost 9 
              Force to this but then managed to deploy enough droids and Merchants 
              by the 2nd insert that I ended up losing 1 Force due to it. I continued 
              to deploy an Operative and another character to each of 6 locations, 
              conveniently losing the Docking Bay to a drain in an attempt to 
              strand his EPP's on Bothawui. He manages to deploy all of the EPP's, 
              and I activate 4 Force with the help of Imperial Supply. I TBHTP 
              his Elis Helrot, and then use TRWEU to cancel it. He informs me 
              that was his only Elis Helrot and his characters are now all stranded 
              on Bothawui.</p>
            <p>I start deploying my extra Operatives to my VSD's at Corulag to 
              retrieve Force. On his next turn, he throws all of his cards down, 
              picks them all up, and says "count your cards". I informed him that 
              he cannot legally pick up his Used Pile and Reserve Deck. He then 
              proceeded to become verbally </p>
            <p>abusive to both me and the TD. I had 27 Force left at the time, 
              with several chances to retrieve still available. All of his EPP's 
              were stranded on Bothawui, with no chance of moving to Corulag. 
              The TD awarded me a forfeit victory, with a +30 differential, which 
              was just enough to put me in first </p>
            <p>place!</p>
            <p>6 (+57)</p>
            <p>Highlights: Winning my first tournament.</p>
            <p>Qualifying for Regionals</p>
            <p>Maintaining my composure during a difficult situation</p>
            <p>Lowlights: The language and behavior of my opponent among 13 year 
              old kids.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, thanks to Rick for running a great tournament. At 
              least we have a ruling on the Droid Merchant issue, so that no other 
              TD's will have contend with an incident of this nature.</p>

            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>The strategies of these decks are easy. With my LS I start with 
              Dagobah, to get some extra force and a chance to make the first 
              Jedi Test, the rest is M &amp; T on Tatooine. My DS is a straight 
              HDADTJ Deck, with enough space support to find a Hidden Base.</p>
            <p>But now to the games!</p>
            <p>GAME 1 : My DS vs. Martin Schumacher (1757) - Hidden Base X - Wing 
              Swarm</p>
            <p>From the start of the game it was clear to me that I have to find 
              his Hidden Base really quickly in order to have a chance against 
              him. I did the normal starting stuff and deployed Vader early. I 
              was lucky to draw</p>
            <p>some sites and deploy my people down there. He never sent anyone 
              down to Tatooine to stop my drains there. It took me a long time 
              to find my Dreadnaughts but I got them at the right moment. I had 
              two of them in my hand as he flipped his objective, so the only 
              problem was finding his Hidden Base. There were several systems 
              on the table so I needed to make a decission and I remember which 
              system he deployed first. I think that nobody can risk it to wait 
              that long to deploy his Hidden Base, but there is one other thing 
              to remember! I must pay attention if he deploys the system from 
              his hand because the hidden base is probably the one just before 
              he flips his Objective. I use this system of finding the HB everytime, 
              with great success so far. </p>
            <p>I needed only two tries to find his Hidden Base. As a result of 
              my Altering of his S-Foils (luckily Red Leader was not on table) 
              he could not inflict that much battle damage against me. Too bad 
              for me I wasn't able to find my other starships and my other sites, 
              while he was lowering my drains with The Planet is</p>
            <p>farthest from. In the end, it was a really non-interactive game 
              that ended in a drain race, which I lost. So I lost the game with 
              7 Force.</p>
            <p>Record: 0 (-7)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GAME 2 : My LS vs. Harald Lange (1760) - HDADTJ</p>
            <p>He started with the big variant of HDADTJ (including the Epic Event) 
              and Bad Feeling I have. We both draw cards and I draw a very good 
              hand, including a Revolution. He activated and drew up. I activated, 
              searched for the Hut of Yoda and deploye… not Yoda. No, a better 
              idea was to deploy the revolution to his Meditation Chamber, giving 
              him a little force choke. I think this was the point where the game 
              was mostly decided. But he made a big comeback, still with only 
              a little force to activate, he deployed</p>
            <p>Vader and to the Holotheatre. My Luke was there to cancel the Visage, 
              so they were standing in the Theatre face to face. He initiated 
              a duel and I lost it, I crossed Luke over (better to lose 5 Force 
              than the 15!!!) But losing Luke wasn't that bad because I could 
              easily form a "rescue" squad. A few turns later, Obi with some friends 
              visited Vader and Luke and they were able to kill Luke. Bringing 
              me to the idea to</p>
            <p>deploy my Luke again ;-) The big problem throughout the game was 
              that he had really not enough force and in the end he had enough 
              force to deploy some things but my advantage at that time was to 
              huge. I could drain this game home. Win with 13 Force.</p>
            <p>Record: 2 (+6)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GAME 3: My DS vs. Harald Lange (1760) - Hidden Base X -Wing Swarm</p>
            <p>He was lucky because he wanted to play Mealstorm, but left his 
              office too early on Friday, so he didn't know something about the 
              clarification. He, however, did have his Hidden Base Deck with him, 
              so he was able to play. Again a Hidden Base Deck, I wasn't happy 
              with that but it was okay. I tweaked my deck to give those Rebels 
              a hard fight. He played his Hidden Base with some Undercover Spies. 
              I realized this as I Monnoked him, making him lose two (maybe all) 
              of his Undercovers. We both tried to setup our things as fast as 
              possible. He deployed TK422 to my Jundland Waste preventing my force 
              drain there. Luckily I draw Lt. Pol Treidum quickly and after 2 
              failed tries, Pol was successful and forced Han to</p>
            <p>break his cover, but the bad thing with TK - 422 is that you cannot 
              battle him. He was immediately captured by Zuckuss and was transferred 
              to the Dreadnaught flying around Tatooine. I sent Zuckuss with him 
              because I needed Zuckuss there to forfeit him to probe for the Hidden 
              Base). My normal system for probing for the Hidden Base didn't work 
              for the first time. I need four tries to find the base. But after 
              I found it the game was over because he wasn't able to block my 
              drains, and his drains weren't that</p>
            <p>huge. A Win for me with again 13 Force.</p>
            <p>Record: 4 (+19)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GAME 4: My LS vs. Michael Waschulewski (1680) - HDADTJ</p>
            <p>A typical match up, I really like to play with my LS against those 
              HDADTJ - Decks! I started with Goo nee tay and he with Bad Feeling 
              ...so everything is expensive. During the first two turns, from 
              the 4 cards</p>
            <p>he lost due to the Visage, 3 of them were Vaders. At that point 
              he got a little nervous, because he put only 6 of them in and still 
              no one in his hand. He got more nervous as I made some jokes, mentioning 
              Out of</p>
            <p>Commision. He really had problems finding a Vader. But as he found 
              one, he saw that everywhere he could deploy there was a H'nemthe. 
              So Vader for 10 force! This brings me in the position to control 
              the game, and won it with 18 force. </p>
            <p>Record: 6 (37)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GAME 5: My LS vs. Martin Schumacher (1757) - TIE Swarm SFS</p>
            <p>I know that I was really in trouble, but I never thought that I 
              was in such big trouble. I set up my drains on Tatooine as fast 
              as possible but couldn't draw enough sites. He was able to set up 
              his retrieval machine fast and killed my FD modifiers on Tatooine...dooh!!!...no 
              chance! So I tried to deploy to Kiffex with a Red Leader. I wanted 
              to fly to the Death Star to cancel that effect, but than something 
              really bad happened. Can you say…Gravity Shadow! So I was stuck 
              there. He prepared the beatdown on his turn and made me lose a lot 
              of force. Game over... Full Loss with 21.</p>
            <p>Record: 6 (16)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GAME 6: My DS vs. Michael Waschulewski (1680) - Tatooine Ground 
              with OMDH</p>
            <p>I had my Vader in my starting hand and could deploy him really 
              quickly to the Cantina. The Cantina was for a long time our only 
              Tatooine site on the table and we fought there every turn, using 
              a lot of interrupts and so on. I began to realize that Ben Kenobi 
              is a killer, because of his extra ability retrieving characters. 
              In this game I learned one lesson, never try to fight old Ben. Maybe 
              playing DS ground is a bad idea, too. That hard fight with that 
              Ben cost me the game and I lost that game with 12 Force.</p>
            <p>Record: 6 (4)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That brings me in the 9th place out of 17 players.</p>
            <p>One really remarkable thing happened at that tournament. Jan Poppe, 
              one of our locals, brought a fun deck with him because he did not 
              do well in the last tournaments. It was a RTP Deck with Death Star 
              Plan and Attack Run. Believe it or not, in one game he did the whole 
              thing including blowing up the Death Star!</p>
            <p>This tournament was very strange because the Swiss system created 
              a terrible situation. All the normally good players played against 
              each other twice and, therefore, defeated each other. The result 
              was that Oliver Kemmet, a player around 1500 was able to win this 
              tournament. </p>
            <p>Here is a listing of his Winning Decks. You will notice it very 
              fast that this deck isn't that strong but anyway, I think for a 
              complete tournament report I should post this.</p>
            <p>Here are the winning decks of the 30th March 1999 in Mainz / Germany</p>

            <p>I added all Decks I knew people played with, and added the Ratings 
              of the players which are under the top 100 in our region. (Ratings 
              are before that tournament)</p>
            <p>I had very bad luck at that tournament, because I only played against 
              3</p>
            <p>different people, and all of them are in the top 100. Okay, that’s 
              good for my rating, I think I will earn around 8 or 9 rating points 
              because of playing against those higher rated player.</p>
            <p>Okay, that should be it for the moment, hopefully you’ve enjoyed

            <p>The Dark Path</p>
            <p>destiny 5</p>
            <p>DS Effect</p>
            <p>Deploy on your side of table. Once per turn, you may peek at the 
              top three cards of your Reserve Deck. Place any two of those three 
              in your Lost Pile.</p>
            <p>In this article I attempt to quantify one aspect of destiny manipulation 
              with The Dark Path, namely its ability to maximize a destiny draw 
              at the expense of two force. I choose to apply the math to this 
              context because the best use of this card has been in the HDADTJ 
              decks that attempt to epic duel. The main thrust of my inquiry is 
              whether or not this effect is worth including in a dueling deck. 
              I will solve this problem by estimating its effectiveness at increasing 
              destiny.</p>
            <p>Let us begin the modeling process by making the simplification 
              that drawing a card for destiny has NO effect on the probability 
              distribution of the remaining destinies in the reserve deck. This 
              is the only real assumption in the model, and were it not made then 
              there would be no degeneracies and the solution would lose much 
              of its elegance.</p>
            <p>Begin by considering the case where only three destiny "classes" 
              are availabe, class A (0-2), class B (3-4), and class C (5-7). We 
              then expound on this model by increasing the number of destiny classes. 
              In this case define the vector X corresponding to the discrete probability 
              densities of these three destiny classes. Let the elements in X 
              be denoted by x[i], where i is a subscript corresponding to 1 for 
              class A, 2 for class B, and 3 for class C. X is normalized to 1.</p>
            <p>Understanding of the maximization mechanic is best achieved through 
              use of a tree diagram which will then collapse to a new probability 
              density function.<br>
              <br>
              <a href="darkpathmapping.htm" target="_blank">Click here to expand 
              Mappings</a><br>
              <br>
              Notice how the tree mappings become irrelevant once the first maximal 
              value has been achieved, and that being equal or lower to a previous 
              draw results in the same maximum so it collapses on the three. Thus, 
              a three class tree has ten final pathways to calculate (6 --&amp;gt; 
              3 --&amp;gt;1) rather than the 27 that one would get if all states 
              were noncollapsing. These endpoints then degenerate to a number 
              of states equal to the destiny class of the initial problem. Furthermore, 
              the nature of the final states is of a fairly noticeable pyramid 
              style pattern.</p>
            </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
            <p>From these results we see that a class four tree will have 1 + 
              3 + 6 + 10 collapsed states and that a class Q tree will have sum(n=1toQ){n(n+1)/2} 
              states. For a class eight tree like in swccg, we have 1 + 3 + 6 
              + 10 + 15 + 21 + 28 + 36 = 120 collapsed states. Assigning the states 
              as A=destiny 0, B=destiny 1, etc., we obtain a sequence as follows 
              for a final set of tree-paths:</p>
            </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
            <p>first draw is A ABCDEFGH, BBCDEFGH, CCCDEFGH, DDDDEFGH, EEEEEFGH, 
              FFFFFFGH, GGGGGGGH, HHHHHHHH</p>
            <p>first draw is B</p>
            <p>BBCDEFGH,BBCDEFGH,CCDDEFGH, etc. (same as a for last part)</p>
            <p>first draw is C</p>
            <p>CCCDEFGH x 3,same for last 5</p>
            <p>first draw is D</p>
            <p>DDDDEFGH x 4, same for last 4</p>
            <p>................</p>
            <p>Now, build the distribution under the maxima by working backwards 
              from the highest branch of the tree first.</p>
            <p>By drawing H first, we garauntee that the maxima is achieved 100% 
              of the time for the second and third draws. The sequence is just 
              H x 8, repeated 8 times. The probability of going down this path 
              to is x[8], so if we start building up our probability distribution 
              right now we have the vector</p>
            <p>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,x[8] ] at the moment.</p>
            <p>Now go down to the second branch. The sequence is GGGGGGGH x 7 
              followed by HHHHHHHH. The initial probability of going down this 
              branch is x[7]. The probability of going down the last sub-branch 
              is then x[7] * x[8] and the probability of going down the first 
              seven sub-branches is</p>
            <p>sum(i=1to7)x[i].</p>
            <p>To achieve state 8 we get an x[8] chance in each of the subbranches. 
              We proceed with this line of reasoning down each tree branch and 
              sub-branch to obtain the probability vector. The formulae used to 
              simplify the iterative calculations are complex. I suggest anyone 
              email the author with</p>
            <p>correspondence if they wish to see them. In any case the solution 
              here is described for the most complex destiny class currently selectable 
              in the game.</p>
            <p>For convenience, I denote Sx[i] as the sum of the first i elements 
              of the original X. Denote the vector to which X is mapping by Y 
              (same notation). Also, Sx[0] is defined as zero.</p>
            <p>We then have </p>
            <p>y[i] = { x[i] * Sx[i] * Sx[i] } +</p>
            <p>{ Sx[i-1] * x[i] * Sx[i] } +</p>
            <p>{ Sx[i-1] * Sx[i-1] * x[i] }</p>
            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>Which is the vector of discrete probabilities mapped by max [X,X,X] 
              . [EDITORS NOTE: All I want to know is does the Dark Path really 
              work and if so how reliably? Andrew can you decipher this for the 
              rest of us non Math types?]</p>
            <p>QED.</p>
            <p>Next time I'll come up with an example of this so that the less 
              mathematically inclined among you will actually be able to interpret 
              what I mean :) I'd also like to come up with a working solution 
              to the current metagame matrix. To do this I'll need some help, 
              namely I would like some of you to email me what you feel the probability 
              of each side winning is for all possible combinations of the following 
              decks (Use whatever you consider to be the "best" variants of each 
              in coming up with your percentages)</p>
            Bothan Ops<br>
            Hidden Base/Xwing Swarm<br>
            Mains and Toys<br>
            Speed ISB<br>
            HDADTJ<br>
            TIE's. 
            <p>That should be a total of nine matchups. If I can get at least 
              ten responses then I'll try to solve.</p>

            <p>Defining the Need for Abstraction</p>
            </font><font face="Arial Narrow"> 
            <p>By David M. Akers</p>
            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>I have read some articles recently that point to the complexity 
              of the game and infinite possibilities of deck variations even within 
              a definable deck type and attribute this as a primary obstacle in 
              defining meaningful deck types and strategies. </p>
            <p>Though all of these arguments have merit what is missing in the 
              primary study of SW: CCG strategy is an appropriate level of abstraction. 
              Therefore when new expansions come out players scramble to find 
              and exploit the new strategies released with that expansion and 
              give up on their current strategies. One of the primary reasons 
              for this phenomenon is that many players find it difficult to separate 
              their cards from their strategy. As a result we have a inadequate 
              system of deck typing based on card constitution (M&amp;T, Numbers.. 
              etc).</p>
            <p>Any deck typing system that will be maintainable must be able to 
              differentiate between what a deck consist of (card wise) and what 
              a deck can accomplish (strategy wise). Now I will assume that many 
              of you realize why deck typing and statistical analysis will improve 
              your deck construction methods and will only focus on the abstraction 
              of SWCCG strategy. </p>
            <b> 
            <p>Laying the foundation: </p>
            </b> 
            <p>As simply as I can put it, both players start with 60 cards in 
              their life force the one who runs out first looses. To some this 
              might seem an oversimplification, I see it as an elegant foundation. 
              Now lets suppose player A deploys their location draws their 8 cards 
              and sits for the rest of the game what would player B have to do 
              to win? In order for player B to win he has to cause the other person 
              to loose 59 cards 8 from hand and 51 from the life force (assuming 
              player A throws from hand first). This of course does not normally 
              happen but it goes too show that in order to win player B must damage 
              player A life force. Almost all strategies inside SWCCG can be divided 
              into offensive (attempting to cause damage to your opponents life 
              force) and defensive (attempting to prevent or repair damage to 
              your own). </p>
            <p>A deck can be given an aggressive ratio based on the proportion 
              of cards dedicated to both defense and offense. A rating of 100/0 
              would be an all offensive deck (theoretically impossible), 50/50 
              would be equal of both , and 0/100 would be pure defensive deck 
              (theoretically impossible).</p>
            <p>Some more astute players will point out and rightly so that one 
              card might be used equally well for defense or offense. For example 
              Myo adds to your battle damage power 3 and he can regenerate when 
              forfeited from a battle. Most cards can be used either offensively 
              or defensively. So each card can have its own aggressive ratio. 
            </p>
            <p>To make matters even more complex is the interaction cards have 
              with each other. Vader Light saber harmless by itself is very aggressive 
              when handed to Vader. Any rating system must also incorporate a 
              method for handling synergistic values greater than the the sum 
              of the component part.</p>
            <p>Do show how the inner level of strategy used by a deck the rating 
              system needs to differentiate between the different types of damage. 
              Example:</p>
            <p>Force Drain: (Bomar, POF)</p>
            <p>Battle Damage: (Vader, Tarkin)</p>
            <p>Inserts: (AFA, NTMTO)</p>
            <p>Other Effects: (Uncontrollable Furry, Asteroid Sanctuary)</p>
            <p>Direct Interrupt Damage (Fear, Limited Resources)</p>
            <p>And differentiate between the different types of defense:</p>
            <p>Force Drain Reducers: (Spies, Imperial Decree)</p>
            <p>Battle Damage Reducers: (Bacta Tank, Mantillian Savrip)</p>
            <p>Insert Blockers (Resistance, Torture)</p>
            <p>Other Effects: ( Death Star Plans, Kessel Run, TBHTP, Grappling 
              Hook)</p>
            <p>Direct Interupt Defense (Were Doomed, On the Edge, Abyssian Ornament, 
              YAB, Sense/Alter/Control)</p>
            <p>This is by no means an exhaustive list of the various categories 
              but is offered only to demonstrate what an appropriate typing system 
              would need to take into consideration. </p>
            <p>So this is a typical deck profiled using this rough deck typing 
              system</p>
            <p>Aggressive ratio 59/41</p>
            <p>Offense:</p>

            <p>Obviously this is an inadequate method to demonstrate the deck 
              type but it does demonstrate the following point: Deck types research 
              built on strategy will be maintainable even after new expansions 
              come along. </p>
            <p>If I discovered that the above deck type work well I could make 
              several decks with a similar profile using different cards and test 
              and see if the strategy behind the cards is sound not just the cards 
              themselves. Then I could find the cards that are the most powerfully 
              fit this profile. Test it against other deck profiles find which 
              one seems most powerful and refine that deck to a razor edge then 
              when a new expansion comes along I would only need to quantify what 
              cards if any enhanced or damaged my power profile.</p>
            <p>The need for this type of abstract deck typing is obvious if this 
              game is to evolve to a higher level. Will some one step forward 
              with a initiative? A initiative to sponsor a deck typing system 
              that is complete and intelligent and takes all the above factors 
              into consideration? Well thats just what I intend to do. In future 
              articles you can expect to see my attempt at laying a solid strategical 
              foundation for clasifying decks. The components are all in place. 
              Look for more to come.</p>

            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>
            <p>Strategy:</p>
            <p>This decks main objective is speed. The first system you pull out 
              should be tatooine so you can move X-Wings there from RP first turn. 
              There are a whole ton of organized attacks in here so you can get 
              X-wings out quick. I ussually spread out 2 x-wings per system with 
              an organized attack in hand and out of nowhere or spiral in hand 
              so you can draw destiny. </p>
            <p>A great combo that i sometimes get off is you have 2 x-wings at 
              a system with s foils activated your opponent deploys a star destroyer 
              you play star destroyer oppent initiates battle you respond with 
              spiral organized attack and out of nowhere you have a power of 17 
              with the ships and a gauranteed destiny 7 and another destiny cobine 
              that with dont underestimate our chances and thats a game deciding 
              battle. Just go for speed get the objective flipped early and you 
              have the game.</p>

            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>Basic start. Start Alderan/Farm/Goo Nee Tay and use the your first 
              turn to pull the swamp and a nudge from the reserve deploy another 
              from Hand and Revolve the opponents locations if you can. </p>
            <p>You should be able to get a good lock soon in the game. The Current 
              Meta supports use of this deck due to overreliance on Coruscant 
              and Walkellmui to start the game. You get out Oola and civil disorder 
              and some ops and a sis sic and you should have the opponent. Use 
              Obi and Luke to sense any evaders.</p>
            <p>If playing an ops deck use the mains to go over and stir up some 
              trouble don't forget to revolve thier sites to make your characters 
              immune to attrition or prevent them from reacting. If you think 
              you have a chance of getting some nudeges down on thier planet early 
              then go for it, many people are only playing 4-5 locations on thier 
              world. If you can cover them you can set mains on the adjacent sites 
              and prevent op deployment entirley. To do this revolve thier swamp. 
              Then you can deploy nudges there from the reserve.</p>
            <p>Some other suprises like the falcon to stop ABC. Have fun this 
              deck might only work for a while.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Well, so how does this deck 
              works ? First know that Narrow Escape is a recent addition (there 
              were some Grimtaash before). This is (as I said before), a Defensive 
              Method 1 Deck: retrieve, retrieve, and retrieve. Card efficiency 
              is also vital, so no Undercover cards.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Basically, you complete Jedi 
              Test 1 while looking carefully for hints of your opponent strategy. 
              Block some early drains with It Could Be Worse if possible, and 
              don’t worry too much if drains of 2 or 3 get through. Use Tunnel 
              Vision to get needed cards if you know these aren’t in your Reserve 
              (use Dagobah or the training area’s game text). Look for the Jedi 
              Tests as quickly as possible to lose them all (but the lowest one) 
              to early drains, since you can retrieve one back each time you complete 
              one. This way you’ll collect cards more quickly and you won’t lose 
              some crucial cards to drains. Then get a Traffic Control on table 
              and start re-circulating destiny 7 cards (3 of them) and some useless 
              cards (like some destiny 6 cards). </font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Then, when Jedi Test 2 is complete, 
              start thinking (not too much, however) offensive : your opponent 
              needs 6 ability to draw destiny at each location, so maybe you can 
              disrupt his strategy somewhere. Your opponent will maybe start to 
              pack up characters for fear of EPP strikes. Fine, just remember 
              that you don’t have to wait for Jedi Test 5 to play your Surprise 
              Assault : with the average number of destiny in this deck, you are 
              ready to Surprise your opponent with some efficiency. If you want 
              to be sure, just play it when your re-circulated cards are on top 
              of your Reserve Deck.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">While playing this deck, it 
              becomes crucial to keep track of your cards in your Reserve Deck. 
              Now, to better explain this deck, I will review each card in detail:</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Locations: &#9;<i>Cloud City: 
              Lower Corridor</i>: 2 DS icons there means that even against –1 
              drain objective, you’ll still drain for somewhat there. Plus, this 
              is the Lower Corridor… All Cloud City players know its strengths: 
              Obi-Wan can’t be circled here without Focused Attack and is power 
              +2. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Cloud City: Downtown 
              Plaza</i>: 2 DS icons there means that even against –1 drain objective, 
              you’ll still drain for somewhat there. You can even retrieve your 
              other Cloud City location should it be in the Lost Pile. The 2 Cloud 
              City sites are also crucial if your opponent is playing a full space 
              deck with Come Here You Big Coward.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Characters:&#9;<i>Luke With 
              Lightsaber</i>: better than Son Of Skywalker because he has a lightsaber 
              incorporated, and the Jedi tests will give him immunity to attrition. 
              Why 2 of them ? Pure security: since Luke won’t be deployed before 
              turn 2, you could lose him to early Force Drains, so another copy 
              minimizes the risks. Then, this means that after Jedi Test 5, you 
              can move Luke out of Dagobah to battle the opponent without fear 
              of losing him, since you will have another in your deck, ready to 
              replace him if he dies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Obi-Wan With Lightsaber</i>: 
              there is only one because many players expect him, and if it is 
              somehow circled, you only lose 1 card, not 2, and not a crucial 
              one either. But it is also a very useful card thanks to his ability&gt;2: 
              this means you can escape via Narrow Escape thanks to him. This 
              is a VERY useful option (think … You Are Beaten on Obi-Wan, and 
              there is Wedge with him. This card will allow Luke’s friend to escape 
              the Empire’s most unpleasant attentions).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Melas and Tawss Khaa</i> 
              : exit doors. Ability 4 aliens, no fear from Scanning Crew, no pain 
              from Bad Feeling I Have, and Tawss Khaa is immune to M’iiyoom Onith, 
              since she’s female.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Wedge Antilles</i>: 
              high forfeit, low deploy, but the real good point is against Carbon 
              Chamber Testing Decks. You wouldn’t want to give away Leia, wouldn’t 
              you ? (think We’re The Bait !, card I played successfully in a tournament, 
              and you’ll know) It would be best, however, to replace him by another 
              ability&gt;2 Rebel, not only because of Narrow Escape, but also 
              because of Stunning Leader.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Leia With Blaster 
              Rifle</i>: the best EPP around, in my opinion. She’s female, also, 
              with ability&gt;2.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>TK-422</i>: an undercover 
              spy, with ability&gt;2, all in 1 card ? Don’t look further, this 
              card is a bomb in this deck, especially since it lets you play On 
              The Edge unhindered.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Artoo</i>: this faithful 
              droid doesn’t seem to belong here. Nothing is farther from the truth. 
              It is a destiny 1 or 6, and so helps you in destiny draws, but also 
              allow you to play Off the Edge on Cloud City without fear of reprisal!</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Effects: &#9;&#9;<i>What Is 
              Thy Biding, My Master ?</i>: this card was sometimes played in the 
              past, and then mysteriously disappeared. Here this card rules. Vader 
              just doesn’t draw any more battle destiny on his own, and isn’t 
              anymore your opponent’s highest ability character on table. Simply 
              put, you can either use this card to make a quick and painless kill, 
              or either to block <i>definitively</i> your opponent’s Sense/Alter 
              capability, since your objective adds 4 to S/A destiny draws, and 
              there aren’t any other ability&gt;4 DS characters in SW:CCG. You 
              may think that an HDADTJ deck could easily pick up Vader into hand 
              to get rid of this nuisance card. Who cares, since What Is Thy Biding, 
              My Master is of no use for S/A protection in this figure because 
              <i>both</i> objectives add 4 to S/A destiny draws.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Frozen Assets</i>: 
              it’s a destiny 5, but it is also a game saver. It will protect you 
              from The Circle Is Now Complete, and from There’ll Be Hell To Pay, 
              just to name a few. No, there is no Draw their Fire/Frozen Assets 
              combo here. This way, no temptation: Frozen Assets will be used 
              how they are supposed to be used, for defense only ! Remember, this 
              is a Defensive deck. Since there are 2 of them, after completing 
              Jedi Test 5, you can create a complete lock-down on the opponent. 
              Here’s how:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">turn X: use Jedi Test 4 to get 
              a Tunnel Vision, if possible; play a Frozen Assets on the opponent’s 
              Force Pile. Draw a Tunnel Vision if none was found in your Reserve 
              Deck before. Retrieve cards if you can/need.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Opponent’s turn X+1: retrieve 
              cards if you can/need.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Turn X+1: use Tunnel Vision 
              to get the other Frozen Assets; if it’s not in there, use Jedi Test 
              4 to get it. Play it. Retrieve cards if you can/need (especially 
              the first Frozen Assets).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Opponent’s turn X+2: retrieve 
              cards if you can/need.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Interrupts:&#9;<i>The Signal</i> 
              (2<sup>nd</sup> one): get your Traffic Control quickly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>It Could Be Worse</i>: 
              good against insert effects also if you don’t have a Don’t Forget 
              The Droids handy. Can be used also as Houjix in battles (but it 
              is risky). Training destiny value: 5, which lets you pass even JT4.</font></p>
            <dir> 
              <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">On The Edge: remember that 
                you can kill your own character with this interrupt also. Especially 
                useful in a losing battle if he’s alone.</font></p>
            </dir>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"><i>Narrow Escape</i>: your Rebels 
              did just gain the Arcona skill. Pretty, isn’t it ? &#74;</font> 
            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Tunnel Vision</i>: 
              key card ! Especially useful in times of need. Also perfect against 
              an HDADTJ deck to pick up Transmission Terminated as soon as you 
              know it’s in your Force Pile. Works also great against Secret Plans: 
              find your On The Edge without drawing all your much needed Force 
              Pile.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Don’t Forget The 
              Droids</i>: destiny 6 card, anti-numbers. Sacrifice Artoo as a last 
              resort.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Control</i>: not 
              just for an ultimate S/A protection or against heavy drains, but 
              also against It’s Worse ! played on your It Could Be Worse. Works 
              only if It Could Be Worse was played on a Force Drain.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;&#9;<i>Strangle</i>: more 
              than a destiny 7. Rescue your captive.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;Overall, this deck can stand 
              against the most vicious decks and win. The only nemesis may be 
              the PSB3 deck, but then, with a lucky hand or perseverance (and 
              heavy retrieving), this deck can win. Against a SFS deck, however, 
              your only hope is time win, or a complete lock-down. Just don’t 
              think to master all its subtleties in a few games. This is a difficult 
              deck and requires a lot of practice to play correctly. Even expert 
              players will experience difficulties: it is very easy to make small 
              mistakes with this deck: there are so many things to keep track 
              of that an error can soon be made.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&#9;In a previous version, there 
              were also 2 Bog-Wings, mainly for defense against Failure At the 
              Cave. If you want to put them back, feel free. Note also that Bog-Wings 
              can also play the devils: you can ambush characters with them, and 
              when Endor will be out, these creatures will eventually see the 
              light. And as they are destiny 5 cards, they are not totally useless.</font></p>

              <br>
              <font size="2">In response to your first question, "Are Sense and 
              Alter a threat tothe current tournament scene?" I have to say no. 
              There are plenty ofcards that counter these two. Control, for instance, 
              cancels Sense and Alter, along with numerous types of effects. Do, 
              or Do Not, and it'sdark side equivalent, There Is No Try, put a 
              halt to people who pack dozens of Senses and Alters in their deck. 
              I, personally wouldn't like to lose 2 force every time I cancelled 
              an opponents interrupt or effect. Still, there are people who pack 
              these in their decks, so I recommend that if you have a deck based 
              mainly on the strategies and effects of Interrupts and Effects, 
              you be sure and pack one or two Door Do Not/There Is No Try's or 
              put in a few Control's in order to protect yourself. However, these 
              two cards, Sense and Alter, are no near as effective as what they 
              used to be.</font><br>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today's tourney scene is rought with 
              ISB decks full of Outer Rim Scouts, Hidden Base decks full of X-Wings, 
              Malestrom decks full of speed 'whoop ass', and Hunt Down/Sienar 
              Fleet decks full of TIEs. It seems that it is impossible to create 
              a deck to effectively deal with these and other winning tourney 
              strategies on a regular and consistent basis; but the truth is that 
              people [in my area at least] have become increasingly daring in 
              the attempt to completely forget about Sense, Alter, and </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Monnok/Grimtassh. People have been 
              stocking fewer and fewer cards to deal with these old school 'control 
              elements' with the belief that the threat of anti-control cards 
              are enough to discourage their opponent from building them into 
              their deck design: their wrong. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this time of diminished preparedness 
              for the SAC-Monnok/Grimtassh onslaught it is time to capitalize 
              on the weakness your foes have unvailed. How do I do that you ask?? 
              Lets look at a few strategies and how 'old school control elements' 
              might be able to help you "murder" your opponent's </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yarna d'al' Gargan/Well Gaurded</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The motive: This card is truly helpful 
              to the swarm decks (i.e. decks which rely on one character/starship/vehicle 
              in multiple) which plague the tourney scene as of late. All of the 
              decks I mentioned in the beginning of the article rely on mass copies 
              of certain cards (e.g. X-Wings &amp;amp; Outer Rim Scouts) to affect 
              good game play and are therefore vulnerable to Monnok/Grimtassh. 
              Most people then crutch these types of decks on Yarna and Well Guarded 
              to keep their doubles safe and usually only include one copy of 
              the card in the deck (sometimes not even starting with it at that!!!) 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The opportunity: Well folks, handling 
              these types of swarm decks can be as simple as Altering Yarna/Well 
              Guarded before the opponent can occupy two battlegrounds and then 
              Monnok/Grimtasshing them to kingdom come !!!</font></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">:-) And what's more, because so many 
              of today's top decks rely on a similar swarm mentality, this is 
              a strategy usable against any number of decks. The means: On the 
              light side, start with Obi's Hut or use a strategy based around 
              high ability characters (such as Our Most Desperate Hour/Hidden 
              Base) and deploy them as quicly as possible thus giving you the 
              ability to Alter Well Gaurded before your opponent can occupy the 
              two battlegrounds to make it immune to Alter. On the dark side, 
              try Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi or any deck archetype which promotes 
              getting a high ability character (preferably Vader) onto the table 
              quickly and Alter Yarna before your opponent can occupy the two 
              battlegrounds. Both of these will leave most opponents W-I-D-E open 
              to Monnok/Grimtassh for the rest of the game or at least hesitant 
              to draw cards for a good while as long as you save 4 force. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Retrieval Cards (e.g. Harvest, All 
              Wings Report In/Short Range Fighters, &amp;amp; Kessel Run)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The motive: Many of today's hot decks 
              also rely on some type of continuous or large one-time retrieval 
              of cards. Cards such as Harvest, All Wings Report In/Short Range 
              Fighters, Abyssin Ornament/Nar Shadda Wind Chimes, Kessel Run, and 
              Sienar Fleet Systems allow the opponent to</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">keep an edge while you often can do 
              nothing about it due to the sheer lack of "silver bullets" [cards 
              which directly counter another card: Quite a Mercenary for example] 
              and/or combat oriented means of dealing with these strategies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The opportunity: Many of these retrieval 
              cards (if not all) are at least in some small way vulnerable to 
              Sense or Alter. Canceling these cards outright can be devastating 
              to many deck archetypes which depend on retrieval. Not to mention 
              that the look on your opponent's face when you cancel the card she 
              was depending on to keep her deck going is priceless. ;-) Retrieval 
              is a key element to maintaining today's card advantage and beating 
              down any strategy which gets cards back for the </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">opponent is going to mean a greater 
              chance for victory in the end.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The means: On the light side, once 
              again high ability characters is key, although speed is not always 
              crucial when trying to cancel retrieval. Against Sienar Fleet Systems, 
              try the same as above to deploy fast and Alter Sienar before they 
              get a chance to occupy Wakeelumi and make it immune to Alter. You 
              might also need a strong space presence to beat down ships at Wakeelumi 
              in case you don't Alter before they occupy. Against other types 
              of retrieval such as Short Range Fighters, Abyssin Ornament, and 
              CC Sabaac/CC Casino speed isn't usually key. Just concentrate on 
              getting a character on the table (preferably Obi) that you know 
              will be successful. On the dark side, once again play high ability 
              character friendly strategies. Hunt Down and Destroy is great for 
              this as well as some other strategies which include charachters 
              of ability 3 or more and an average destiny of 2 or less. Against 
              these types of retrieval speed for the dark side is usually not 
              of the essence either. Just deploy and control the environment when 
              your sure you'll draw good destiny. Add Secret Plans to your S&amp;amp;A 
              strategy and LS retrieval is easily managable.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Power Enhancements</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The motive: Another key element to 
              today's top decks are power enhancement cards. Cards like Manuevering 
              Flaps, S-Foils, All Power to Weapons/Organized Attack, and Rebel 
              Ambush/Trooper Assault are used to give one the power advantage 
              in any situation. The cards are often the decision maker in battles 
              can make the difference between battling effectively and getting 
              the beat down. On the bright side of things though, all of these 
              cards are immune in one way or another to Sense or Alter!! </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The opportunity: These cards are depended 
              upon for most decks to operate effectively. On their own, TIEs, 
              and stormtroopers suck but many people build decks based around 
              them. Moreover, X-Wings and Speeders are decent cards in and of 
              themselves but are often no match for the dark side on their own. 
              Decks built around these strategies are at a serious disadvantage 
              without these power enhancements and taking them away from your 
              opponent is prime.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The means: On the light side, same 
              as above. High ability, good draws and solid use of available resources 
              is good. In this case speed isn't an important element. Most of 
              the dark sides strategies in this area have no way to protect there 
              enhancers without help from other cards </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(e.g. There is No Try), so feel free 
              to take your time. On the dark side, same as before with the exception 
              or Manuevering Flaps and S-Foils. These cards can hurt real bad 
              so take the time to work in a speed contingency for Altering these 
              cards before they get out one of the characters necessary to protect 
              their effects or simply build in provisions for taking out these 
              characters at inopportune times for your opponent (e.g. Sniper or 
              Overwhelmed) so your opponent has no chance to respond before your 
              can lay your Alter down succesfully.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Bottom Line</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sense and Alter are still a viable 
              and valuable part of Star Wars. They are even more so recently because 
              most people have been lulled into a false sense [no pun intended 
              ;-) ]of security due to either the sheer threat of counters such 
              as Do or Do Not/There is No Try or the belief that they can successfully 
              (and in short order) qualify cards, like S-Foils and Well Guarded, 
              for immunity to 'control elements' successfully. Many times they 
              are wrong. Praying on this weakness by </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Altering and Sensing those power enhancers, 
              retrieval cards, and Monnok/Grimtassh protectors can often doom 
              any deck to a complete state of chaos. Destroying their crutch cards 
              before they can protect themselves or even taking away that one 
              card they depended on to get them through the battle (like Trooper 
              Assault) can really give you the advantage in any situation. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But is this truly the way?? Can Alter 
              and Sense be effectively prepared for without wasting alot of slots 
              on stopping these 'control elements' on decks with no Sense, Alter, 
              or Monnok/Grimtassh?? And if so, what's the most card effective 
              way to prepare my deck??? Check out my next article entitled "Fortifying 
              Yourself Against SAC-Monnok/Grimtassh" where I will attempt to answer 
              these questions and more including the true card advantage of using 
              'control elements' despite your opponents fortification. C-ya!!!

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Sense and Alter are always a 
              threat in tournament play. The cards have the potential to ruin 
              every deck. When you create a tournament deck, you should always 
              think how you will protect yourself against SAC. It actually happens 
              quite early in the deckbuilding process. You decide first with a 
              general theme and then decide what to do about SAC. SAC has a big 
              influence on deckbuilding.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">If you decide SAC yourself, 
              there's not that much of a guideline, except more is better. Especially 
              pre-SE this was very much true. If you encountered someone else 
              who also chose the SAC approach you had to have more of them than 
              your opponent. Actually you need more in hand than your opponent, 
              which is slightly different. (eg early light Tatooine decks could 
              go with slightless SAC than dark tatooine decks. Because of Obi'hut 
              and Obi for deploy of 2 and the overall lower deploy cost of the 
              main characters. LS could draw more cards in hand, so increasing 
              the chance of holding more SAC in hand.) </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Monnok/grimtaasch is also essential 
              in a SAC war. It forces your opponent to engage a SAC war, where 
              the player of the Grimnok has the advantage (since you need only 
              as much SAC as the opponent to win) </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Let's take a closer look at 
              the anti-SAC strategies and it's history by going back to the releases 
              of expansions and what they changed.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Premiere</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Sac could be only countered 
              by Sac or by playing only non-red cards. Unfortunately that last 
              thing was not much of an option back in those days. So Sac was played 
              by all.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">ANH</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Introduced the grapples and 
              grimtaasch/monnok, as an added defense. My favourite combo in those 
              days was Tentacle/alter. I played with 2 Tentacles and about 4-5 
              Alters. 1 Tentacle + 1 alter and 1 force left, was almost foolproof. 
              It was quite adequate. With the introduction of control in Dagobah, 
              I abandoned the strategy. Control could outright cancel the alter.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Hoth</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Nothing in this set that changed 
              the environment.. except 'hardware' decks (decks with very little 
              sense/alter vulnerable cards in them) became tournament viable mainly 
              due to the introduction of walkers. There were enough cancel cards 
              in non-interupt form who could cancel popular strategies. (eg Lt 
              Pol Treidum, Seekers both to kill undercover spies). From Hoth on, 
              hardware decks remained a viable strategy.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Dagobah</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Introduced control. A very good 
              card, cancels sense/alter and as secundary use cancels a force drain. 
              + introduction of Do or do not and There's no try. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">With Dagobah I think SAC was 
              never more popular. Control was just an extra card in the SAC decks 
              that could help in a SAC war and also cancel force drains.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Do or do not and there's no 
              try, didn't have quite an effect, first of all, because you needed 
              more than one in a deck to get one out before it was too late and 
              second, because playing with Do or do not usually meant the opponent 
              had no SAC and canceling a card was worth sacrificing 3 cards</font></p>

            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">CC</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Nothing... </font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Jabba's Palace</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Starting interupts. now, you 
              could start with that Do or do not, or There's no try. It made sure 
              you had SAC protection from the start and you didn't need more than 
              1 copy. But the SAC player still had the advantage, he only needed 
              to be careful what to sense/alter. But the opponent's crucial cards 
              still went down.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Until here, in my opinion, the 
              only viable SAC defense was playing a couple of 'push' cards (what 
              are you trying to push on us and there'll be hell to pay) and controls. 
              It was always difficult to play because of the constant threat of 
              monnok/grimtaasch, killing your controls. The hardware option still 
              remains the easiest way to play anti-SAC, unfortunately the deck 
              itself had so many weaknesses because of the lack of red cards. 
              But still in the hands of an excellent player, it was tournament 
              viable.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">SE</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">With the release of SE, there 
              are a lot more possibilities... let's go past the cards which have 
              an impact on the anti-SAC play and in the same time go past every 
              anti-SAC possibility :</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">1) hardware deck </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Still a viable deck, though 
              with the recent escalation of power, a walker with 2 pilots isn't 
              as safe anymore (especially with mechanical failure but I don't 
              see it played very much). A good deck I see is Raltiir operations 
              with no sense/alterable cards in.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">2) HDADTJ/MWYHL</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">These cards have a huge impact. 
              Not anymore has the opponent a good chance of canceling your card 
              and paying for it, he isn't sure anymore. The flip side is of course 
              the ultimate SAC counter. never rely on this objective alone to 
              counter SAC. With the front side on, there's no discouragement whatsoever 
              for the opponent to play his SAC. He still can play it, it always 
              goes to the used pile and maybe it can cancel something! Use it 
              in conjunction with either there's no try or what're you trying 
              to push on us. My favourite start for these objectives is oppressive 
              enforcement/wise advice. Not only because the go-to-used-pile function 
              of canceled cards, but because of your pushcards deploying for free. 
              Wise Advice has of course the added benefit of adding one to training 
              destiny.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Don't rely on them as anti-SAC 
              protection. Never play it alone that's not good enough. Your opponent 
              can still cancel everything at will. In fact I only play this card 
              when I can use the other functions of it too. eg in a deck with 
              Stardestroyers for the dark side, or in a training deck for the 
              light side.</font></p>

              start with it, I do. Sometimes I even use it as my only SAC protection. 
              I only do this when I use a lot of interupts/effects. I prefer the 
              nasty ones that keep returning. eg visored vision, sabac, narow 
              escape, hyper escape, multiple on the edges, off the edges... and 
              so on. that way there are too many of them to sense them all, and 
              they are all sort of critical...</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">These Jedi Pack cards let you 
              exclude the highest ability character when drawing destiny for SAC. 
              If you combine this with HDDTJ/MWYHL then there's no way the opponent 
              can sense alter something. the only drawback to this card is you 
              need 1 force. But sometimes leaving force is good all together, 
              just so you won't be surprised by a draw their fire. Secundary use 
              for this card is adding one destiny when your opponent plays suprise 
              assault. With the abundance of Suprise assault/counter assault these 
              days, this card might be a good choice.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Conclusion :</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">There are a wide variety of 
              possibilities when deciding playing SAC or Anti-SAC much more than 
              it used to play. All the better I would say. Since SE, Alters have 
              become sometimes more critical than senses. All the good effects 
              in SE made it really worthwile to stock some alters. So you could 
              try to stock your deck with 4 alters and 2 push cards, especially 
              if your area is low in SAC. It gives you sense protection (push 
              the sense card and alter them afterwards), meanwhile giving you 
              also an offense by canceling critical effects. (but be wary of monnok/grimtaasch)</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">As you can see, the play environment 
              around here (Seattle) is varied and diverse, and lots of different 
              deck types are being played. Many are proving to be successful and 
              winning too. I recently won a tournament (was the only one undefeated 
              out of 18 participants) with 2 decks that didn't use a ton of rares 
              and had no Main characters (the X-Wing Deck I wrote about in Scrye 
              6.1) </font></p>

            <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size=5>By: </font><font face="Arial Narrow">David 
              Akers</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">I'll make this short and to 
              the point. Unless your packing the stuff to outright keep your opponent 
              from playing Sense or Alter(ie quick Hunt Down) then you will have 
              to worry about them and put counters in your deck (or play the higly 
              prized all immune deck). There will be those that play them for 
              no other reason than they don't think you will expect to see them.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Which follows my principle. 
              Never play the deck your opponent wants you to play. If SA protection 
              is thinning out in your area and you don't think to many people 
              will see it coming. Then go Heavy with it, don't forget the Monnok/Grimtash. 
              The very next tourney go No SAC and mop up all the people that started 
              with SAC protection. :)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">the truth is people unless your 
              playing HuntDown or MWYHL and starting with For Luck then you better 
              see it coming Sense and Alter are here to stay. </font></p>

            <p>&#9;Who would have thought that I, The Tick, would finally get 
              a chance to help contribute to the SWCCG community. Thanks to Dave 
              Akers for the opportunity to help make DeckTech a helpful, unique 
              resource for the SWCCG player.</p>
            <p>This column will feature a new deck every issue along with the 
              reviews we have received that help make it the best it can be. We 
              will also include a deck with no reviews. I invite readers to send 
              in their assessment and reviews to be printed with that deck in 
              the next issue. As this is our first column there are no reviews!</p>
            <p>As editor of The Workshop I plan to not use any of the usual acronyms 
              for the SWCCG cards that are so popular in tournament reports and 
              "the other guy's" reviews. For example, in this column you will 
              not see "DLOTS" but you will see "Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the 
              Sith." I feel that some players, especially newer ones, often do 
              not know the acronyms we use Therefore, the column will use the 
              plain card titles to make it easy.</p>
            <p>Our first deck was submitted by Daeyel, King of OT, a known Decipher 
              Discussion BBSer. The deck is Light Side, the theme is: Harvest/Mind 
              What You Have Learned.</p>

              <p>1.&#9;This is top secret. This is my Regional, and (haha) WC 
                deck.</p>
              <p>2.&#9;Report any changes, wins, losses to me (include reason 
                for change, and type of deck beat, or lost to.</p>
              <p>3.&#9;HAVE FUN. This is a fun deck, as far as battling and opponent 
                reactions go.</p>
            </dir>
            <p>Ok, if Sense, Alter and Control are important to you, place Yoda 
              in and remove two Frozen Assets, and a Sorry About The Mess. You 
              must have Yoda in, and even then, it is only a 50-50 chance that 
              you will succeed. Let me run, card by card, an analysis of what 
              is in this deck and why it is there.</p>
            <p><u>Mind What You Have Learned/Dagobah stuff</u> - You will never 
              use this. This is just to turbo the beginning, as well as to goad 
              them into throwing down a bad Starting Effect. You will have at 
              least six generation on turn two.</p>
            <p><u>Forest</u> - A good side strategy, if they play space. You can 
              drop this down, and toss an EPP there, and you have immunity, and 
              a Force Drain. This card is expendable, however.</p>
            <p><u>Tatooine: Cantina, Yoda' s Hut</u> - The main weakness of this 
              deck, is the rare all out space deck. These give you a good drain, 
              and a lure to come down. Revolution the Hut.</p>
            <p><u>Jabba's Palace: Audience Chamber</u> - I Must Be Allowed to 
              Speak goes here, and when Luke comes down there, he is immune to 
              attrition. Don't hold Luke waiting for it, though, you have 2, just 
              lose the old, and drop the new.</p>
            <p><u>Lars' Moisture Farm</u> - Well, you kind of need this to run 
              the Harvest effectively. Don't panic, the Lars retrieve 2 at any 
              other site together, so you can get this back.</p>
            <p><u>EPP's</u> - These are for a quick run, just drop, slash, and 
              forfeit. You get them back. Try to get Luke protected with I Must 
              Be Allowed To Speak.</p>
            <p><u>Ben Kenobi</u> - Save Yoda's Gimer Stick for Ben, since you 
              park him at Lars' Moisture Farm, with The Lars. Amazingly effective, 
              the only characters who can battle here, are those with ability 
              4 or more - not a lot of those around. With the destiny of this 
              deck ,Vader is easy meat. Lose A Lars, bring 'em back. Toss the 
              villain out of play with Out Of Commission.</p>
            <p><u>The Lars</u> - 3 should prevent Mosep from eliminating him.</p>
            <i></i> 
            <p><u><i>WORD ON MOSEP</i></u> - Kind of a threat. He comes down, 
              he gets hacked, and sent out of play. No questions asked, no matter 
              the cost. You'll get them back.</p>
            <p><u>Wyron Serper</u> - This is your pocket boy. If you see Carbon 
              Chamber Testing, that's what he was made for. If Hunt Down And Destroy 
              The Jedi is hurting you, just use this guy to kill the Visage of 
              the Emporer. He's a spy. He's a rebel. What more can you ask for?</p>
            <p><u>Red Leader in R1, Landing Claw</u> - This is kind of a weak 
              answer to the space threat, but at least you can stick him on something 
              and cancel a drain. If they move, you can ask where they are going. 
              You can detach in any phase, and reattach to a different ship in 
              a control phase. Don't let them move you to a site they can't drain 
              at!</p>
            <p><u>Harvest</u> - This is the money maker. There is a trick to this, 
              very simple: When you are set up, you will use very little force, 
              this is for Secret Plans, and obtaining Harvest. At the end of your 
              turn, in your draw phase, draw until you get a Harvest. Immediately 
              cash it in. Draw for another. Use this in the opponents control 
              phase, and you cannot ever be Grimtaashed with two in hand. Use 
              second Harvest to get the first Harvest, and three others.</p>
            <p><u>Out Of Commission</u> - This is the fun card. Play these as 
              soon as you get them, they are used, and you don't want them in 
              your hand when they run Monnok. Remember, red cards (Interrupts 
              and Effects) can still be used, even if "out of play." You don't 
              have to inform your opponent this and quite a few will think the 
              unique effects and interrupts can't be played. I make it a point 
              to point out after the game, that they can still be used. Let them 
              sense this, with Mind What You Have Learned adding four to the draw, 
              their chances are very slim.</p>
            <p><u>Nabrun Leids</u> - This is to get into an Ops area, if you are 
              landlocked on Tatooine.</p>
            <p><u>Sorry About The Mess</u> - The sniper card. Use this to eliminate 
              a "big gun" that you don't want to face in battle. (I.E. Darth Vader 
              or Boba Fett)</p>
            <p><u>Grimtaash</u> - The usual "too many cards in your hand for your 
              own good" trick</p>
            <p><u>The Signal</u> - This, I used to use with Wise Advise, but with 
              the new opening, Sense/Alter are almost useless. I guess you have 
              to pick which one you want to start with, depending on what you 
              see to be their strategy.</p>
            <p><u>Shocking Info</u> - The best counter to Scanning Crew yet. I 
              only wish I had room for more. Usually, where there's one, there's 
              more, so they may assume that you've more than one.</p>
            <p><u>Quite A Mercenary</u> - Nothing could be more painful than getting 
              "Merced" then watching them all go out of play via Out Of Commission.</p>
            <p><u>Frozen Assets</u> - One of the Key cards. With Draw Their Fire 
              on the table, you can beatdown, and they cannot Ghhhk away the damage. 
              This should be how you inflict most of your damage.</p>
            <p><u>Yoda's Gimer Stick</u>. With this on Ben, and Ben at the Farm, 
              the Clinton family should be so lucky! Their own bodyguard.</p>
            <p><u>I Must Be Allowed To Speak</u> - Luke's version of Yoda's Gimer 
              Stick. Just shake well, and follow the directions on the side of 
              the package.</p>
            <p><u>Lightsaber Proficiency</u> - As if Power 5, Immunity to attrition 
              wasn't enough, let's make him power 8!</p>
            <p><u>Revolution </u>- Use this on the Hut - Obi's, that is. Drain 
              of three. Good magnet for a beatdown.</p>
            <p><u>Draw Their Fire</u> - Part of the Frozen Assets thing. Even 
              gives you a cheesy retrieval for initiating battle (ed. note Cheesy? 
              Incentive to battle is cheesy?!?!), which you should be doing lots. 
              Be careful, if gives him a retrieval, if he initiates. But he won't 
              right? No force to retrieve, nobody to fight with. Right? ;)</p>
            <p><u>Traffic Control</u> - Your generic recycler. Two would be nice 
              to always get this guy in opening hand...</p>
            <p>Your major weakness is space, and Secret Plans. You drain for three 
              at the hut, one at the farm, one at the forest, one at the Cantina, 
              one at the Audience Chamber, for a total of eight. You retrieve 
              eight for his round of Force Drain so, he must drain for 17, before 
              you start losing the drain war. When retrieving, retrieve the last 
              Harvest, and three high destiny, or if in peril, some EPP's. The 
              trickiest part, is when to retrieve sites. You may need some for 
              added Force Drain, or to boost differential. One neat trick, is 
              to slowly bleed your forces off the table, into the lost pile, and 
              back into the deck. VERY hard to do, and do well. you could however, 
              get a differential of up to fifty if you did this.</p>
            <p>Well, that is all, let me know of any cool tricks you come up with, 
              and your successes. There should not be any failures! :) Let me 
              know if you have any trouble assembling this deck, and I will help 
              you finish.</p>
