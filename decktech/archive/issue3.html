            <p>It’s been awhile since the last issue of DeckTech but here it is. 
              This month we emphasize quality over quantity. Yes some people submitted 
              decks and tournament reports, but it is not my intention to make 
              you the subscribers of DeckTech wade through a bunch of mediocre 
              verbiage to find the good stuff. I simply won’t waste your time 
              with it. DeckTech is evolving into a different kind of Newsletter. 
              The Team at DeckTech are not sure what yet, but we are excited to 
              play our part in this online drama. </p>
            <p>Expect things to pick up again when Endor is released and as we 
              approach the regionals. For now the excitement of TPM and YJ have 
              all contributed to the overall stagnation of SW: CCG. Endor will 
              jumpstart us and provide us the opportunity to shine as the Internets 
              best online SW: CCG players resource.</p>
            <p>Thanks to everyone who contributed this month. Read and Enjoy.</p>

              Wars Celebration<br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by Neal Razi</font></font></p>
            <b><font face="Arial"> </font></b><i></i></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2><i>"I'm sorry, I just think that 
              your senses and alters are cowardly."</i></font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
              - one of my opponents after an 8 point loss at the celebration tournament. 
              Except for 2 force drains, all his damage came from <u>Uncontrollable 
              Fury</u> and <u>Anger, Fear, Aggression.</u></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Neal here. i'll keep this brief, 
              as i know these can get quite long. Rather than a blow by blow account 
              of games, i'm going to try to focus on the larger picture, as always 
              draw some conclusions and give a special nod to deck tech. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">About 60-70 players came, nearly 
              all very high caliber. Number one ranked, numerous top 100 and Matt 
              Potter were all there. Tournament started late, and was only three 
              games, everyone receiving a bye to keep it "sanctioned"( i use quotes 
              because I don't think Decipher ever counts these toward rankings. 
              I haven't seen this one count yet.) Since it was three games only, 
              the winner, who received a full set of Endor, was going to be strictly 
              down to points. I can't even tell you who won, sorry! It didn't 
              matter to me, it wasn't me and i was too busy trying to soak up 
              some real quality tournament experience, which is very hard to come 
              by. Let's move on to the rulings I encountered/overheard, in order 
              of interest, although i'll list all for reference.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">1) <b><u>Secret Plans </u>- 
              Partial force could be spent to partially retrieve force.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Several times in the tournament 
              a light side player couldn't afford to retrieve all force in one 
              shot(all wings report in, mind what you have learned). The player 
              was allowed to just spend a portion of force, retrieve that amount 
              of force and leave the rest canceled. I suspect this may be wrong, 
              is there an "official" ruling?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">2) <b><u>Hidden Base</u> - a 
              minumum of five systems must be deployed not six. </b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">my opponent claimed in his area 
              the errata phrase "and your hidden base" meant in addition to the 
              five battleground systems. he was, of course, wrong.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">3) <b><u>Droid Merchant</u> 
              - One force for each droid merchant per droid </b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">This one has been reported inconsistently. 
              I agreed with the ruling. no i was not playing maelstrom at the 
              celebration(more on this later)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">4) <b><u>Bespin: Cloud City</u> 
              - It is a Cloud City Location. </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">In response to occupation of 
              <u>Bespin</u> system and deployment costs. this was obvious to me, 
              yet i'm reporting it anyway.</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Conclusions Drawn</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Feel free to disagree</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">1) <u>Hidden base</u> is still 
              a very viable deck! Ignore it at your extreme peril.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">2) <u>Hidden Base</u> swarm, 
              however, is over-rated and probably less effective than other variants.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">3) Sense, Alter can still be 
              extremely effective in the tournament scene.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">4) <u>Yarna Gargan</u>, and 
              <u>Well-Guarded </u>are very dangerous starting effects. Many people 
              lost them on the first or second turn, and got <u>grim-nocked</u> 
              out of the game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">5) Despite the rebels being 
              able to just plain whup-up on the empire via a number of ways, there 
              are still many who WILL play a "coward" deck. Be prepared with some 
              kind of insert control, and seriously consider, <u>Come Here You 
              Big Coward</u>. This reverses an earlier feeling of mine.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">6) If you go to a tournament, 
              expect to see maelstrom and no shelter(more later), and the isb 
              spread out and drain, ghhk deck.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">7) Deck tech is a very useful 
              and highly effective resource.(keep reading)</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Deck Tech report</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">I was very happy to find two 
              other deck tech correspondents at the celebration. <b>John Arendt 
              </b>and <b>Mike Gerard</b> not only seemed to be excellent players, 
              but high caliber persons to match. I have to admit, it was nice 
              to have a feeling of comradery at such a far away tournament, and 
              i found the information exchange principles of deck tech are very 
              useful. All three of us did very well, i was undefeated, John was 
              2 and 1, don't know about mike's final record, but i did see him 
              crush someone. Furthermore, i'd hazard that over 50% of light side 
              players were playing variants of either editor <b>David Aker'</b>s 
              Maelstrom deck or correspondent <b>Mike Fitzgerald'</b>s No Shelter, 
              a great tribute to the caliber of players that write here. I heard 
              numerous isb'ers crying how they couldn't ghhk after being hit with 
              <u>Draw Their Fire</u> and <u>Frozen Assets </u>or <u>Beggar</u>, 
              or getting <u>Revolutioned</u> on the first turn. Reading deck tech 
              I have concluded, can gain you an edge in such an "internet deck" 
              dominated scene.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">And it's nice to have a friendly 
              face or two at a world caliber tournament!</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">A final word about the celebration 
              itself</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Nothing to do with any tournaments, 
              here it is. The celebration was moderately fun, but if you missed 
              it, don't regret it. The weather was miserable, the staff even worse(security 
              even worse than that!). The most interesting part, for me, was seeing 
              and listening to the actors and their stories, they were actually 
              both very, very gracious(especially Ray Park, a great guy) and quite 
              entertaining(Anthony Daniels was hilarious). The displays in the 
              main area, were overly commercialized, although some were interesting. 
              The fan costumes, TOP NOTCH! Life size X-wing- not even close, Youg 
              Jedi- boring, official store- a three hour line, didn't even go. 
              Overall, fun if you went, but don't feel bad if you didn't.</font></p>

              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>by Neal Razi</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>&#9;</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>You are 
              locked in a tight match. You and your opponent are matched in skill, 
              and in deck quality. Who's going to win? Some would say the luckier 
              player, but generally it'll be the first one who slips, and in a 
              tight, tense game say it's the sixth game of a tournament, usually 
              someone cracks. Since there are so many excellent(and i do mean 
              excellent) articles this issue dealing with being a good player, 
              i'm going to talk about an area i've become increasingly interested 
              in lately, the so called "Mind Game".</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>&#9;Believe me you are engaging in this now whether you know it 
              or not, at every tournament. You and your opponents, the better 
              ones at least, are locked in a struggle of wills, as well as cards. 
              A chess national champion(my Fortran teacher) once told me, "At 
              that point, Neal, there's almost never a new move, because all the 
              moves have been done a hundred years ago. Basically it boils down 
              to who can out-pysch the other." Now if you think swccg can get 
              rough or cutthroat, just imagine a national chess tournament! He 
              told me players there will do anything to distract their opponent, 
              even to the extent of wearing glasses crooked just to annoy the 
              opposition. Bobby Fisher, a world chess champion, was well noted 
              for his general rudeness, opponents hated to play against him, he 
              was just so obnoxious. Do you think tennis great John McEnroe cried 
              all the time just because he was angry? No, he was trying to break 
              the concentration of his oppostion. At this point, I'm going to 
              recommend you all go out and rent a great movie, "Pumping Iron". 
              It's a documentary about Body Building in the 70's at it's peak(the 
              great Arnold Schwarzenegger is the main man), and you will be amazed 
              at the lengths others will go to throw your mind. If you are serious 
              about competition, there is a lot to be learned from this movie.</p>
            <p>&#9;Now at this point, before going into detail, I'd like to state 
              a couple things. Number 1, I am in no way an expert! I am just making 
              conclusions on what I see, and other deck techers, please resond 
              to either David or me on this article. Number 2, I am in no way 
              advocating that when you play, you make a total ass out of yourself, 
              as a matter of fact please don't. There are enough asses in the 
              world today, and I'm not talking about donkeys. I just want you 
              to be prepared and to learn and help me learn from some of the concepts 
              I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about the ways of using 
              and countering each strategy, remember i am NOT recommending them, 
              just analyzing.</p>
            <p>&#9;Ok, let's get down to business. First, I'm going to go through 
              some of the known ways of distracting. This is not an extensive 
              list, like I said email with more. You may also encounter more than 
              one at the same time. Later, I'm going to introduce a concept that 
              only recently occured to me.</p>
            <p><b>1) The cocky attitude</b> - This one I hate most of all, because 
              over the years, through basketball, video game tournaments and swccg, 
              this is the one that gives me the hardest time. The cocky player 
              will continually boast, draw attention to his own "great" moves("Man, 
              did you see what i did, that was beautiful, have you ever seen anything 
              that beautiful?") and try to make you feel dumb. My advice, don't 
              get into an attitude war with him, he is an expert and usually very 
              quick witted, and you'll wind up losing the verbal war, getting 
              frustrated and angry, and slipping. For those of you who wish to 
              try this method, remember, you're upping the ante! If you lose, 
              you'll look very, very stupid. You have to be good, and frankly 
              not mind being a total ass.</p>
            <p><b>2) The outburster</b> - Our friend and editor David Akers often 
              uses this strategy. Suddenly, in a very quiet tense moment, the 
              outburster will start laughing, or singing, or sneezing or use some 
              other kind of sharp, shocking, mind attack to destroy your concentration. 
              My advice, simply laugh, and regroup, wait a second or two, and 
              to get back on your train of thought, look around the table. Psychology 
              has showed that visual clues will help mentally retrace your steps. 
              If you want to try this, it is one of the least obnoxious, and I 
              think used sparingly, just might be enough to swing the game at 
              a crucial point. Plus, it's just passive-aggressive enough to be 
              impossible to prove!</p>
            <p><b>3) The pesterer</b> - The pesterer will keep bugging you about 
              details. Rather than one thunderous attack, he will rely on you 
              thinking about the questions he is continually asking you taking 
              up part of your processing power, leaving you with less brain resources 
              to use in the game itself. </p>
            <p>&#9;Sadly, I have used this tactic, when I find an opponent annoying. 
              Example, At the celebration(i mentioned this in an earlier article), 
              I came up against a dagobah, force retrieval, training, hide and 
              insert deck, and the dude put my most hated card, Uncontrollable 
              Fury, on me on like the 4th turn. Now in that kind of slow game, 
              U.F. will be your doom. So I was just irritated enough to start 
              pestering. Everyone knows how complicated those jedi tests can be 
              right? Well, i proceeded to ask him to explain in detail every possible 
              ramification, outcome, chance of completing, deployment restriction, 
              can it move, can i cancel it, can you subtract from my destinies 
              for sense and alter if you wanted to(I was particulary proud of 
              that one!), I mean everything, and you know what I could see him 
              having to stop and think about it, and losing concentration. I won 
              by 8 points, and while we were playing such opposite decks that 
              perhaps it didn't have an effect, all it takes in an 8 point game 
              is one crucial move to swing it the other way. Plus, I wanted to 
              punish him for that sort of deck.</p>
            <p>&#9;I recommend for this, to simply turn the ball over to him, 
              and say "read the card". David will frequently do this to a pestering 
              opponent, or counter by insulting his intelligence ("don't you know 
              any of the rules?" or something)so he wil stop. If you want to try 
              this, it can be somewhat effective and it can be a good "payback" 
              tactic to an annoying opponent.</p>
            <p><b>4) Uncontrollable Fury</b> - You may find yourself against an 
              opponent who starts getting very angry. This will be very unnerving, 
              because it is instinctive nature in nearly all animals to remove 
              themselves from a violently angry creature. They will start slowly, 
              perhaps by whining, and if a turn of events go against them, escalate. 
              At this point they are hoping that sub consciously you will let 
              up, and you know what, you may. I recommend telling yourself, "This 
              is a ploy and if it's not then there is no reason for someone to 
              get this angry over a game." Don't tell them, "To take it easy" 
              they usually will only increase their rage, because they can see 
              it's getting to you. If it gets out of hand, ask the tournament 
              director to remove them from the tournament. If they forfeit a game(40+ 
              differencial) enough times, they'll stop. Try to remember though, 
              sometimes it is unintentional, they may acutally be a decent person 
              who is in some kind of bad circumstance. If you use this strategy, 
              be forewarned, no one will want to play against you, and you run 
              the run the risk of becoming a stagnant player. Also, this may not 
              matter to you, but it is very unsportsmanlike. That being said, 
              unfortunately, i have seen this strategy work.</p>
            <p><b>5) The sloth</b> - Another absolutely infuriating tactic is 
              to just try to drag the game out and make it so boring that the 
              opponent loses interest and hence concentration, begins playing 
              recklessly. Believe me, I have played a player that was so agonizingly 
              slow that I wanted to throw the game. They will sit there and ask 
              dumb questions like "what's your total power at that site?" 5 or 
              6 times or just keep looking at their cards, or keep taking cards 
              back. This is a hard strategy to combat, and i'm open to suggestions. 
              David recommends calling the director over on stalling, but it is 
              very difficuly to prove. I usually just try to play fast, sort of 
              a shame factor, and use the opponent's turn to just plan my move 
              ahead so i can move quickly. warning, do not play so fast you become 
              reckless, it is very, very easy to do as you will underestimate 
              your opponent. If you play this tactic, you will probably not become 
              a very good player due to the fact you will end up timing out frequently, 
              and once again you will get little practice because no one will 
              want to play against you.</p>
            <p><b>6) Speedy Gonzalez</b> - Strangely, I have encountered this 
              too, a player who deploys at warp speed(and i'm a pretty fast player) 
              in an effort to throw you off. generally, he will end up making 
              an incredible amount of mistakes, but see the strategies for The 
              Sloth and reverse them.</p>
            <p><b>7) The Weirdo</b> - Rarely seen, this harkens back to what I 
              said earlier about crooked glasses. The weirdo will just try to 
              behave so strangely that you will be distracted. I once played against 
              a player at the regionals who periodically moaned and proceeded 
              to play with his arm thorough his neck hole. He beat me, in a 5 
              point match! I know i made mistakes, and I think I might lost due 
              to his behavior, which was insulting my intelligence, and hence 
              made me angry. I've heard of players wearing whirling beanies at 
              Magic tournaments. I think the best thing to do, once again, is 
              laugh at this thing, acknowledge the weirdness to yourself, and 
              then just give the illusion of ignoring it. Don't let it get to 
              you, and don't complain about it, you'll be playing right into his 
              hands. If you feel confident, say, "Man, you are one weird dude." 
              If you want to try this, go ahead, I am at this point unsure of 
              its effectiveness, all you have to do is think of some crazy looking 
              or sounding gimmik, and just try to unconcern yourself with our 
              "normal" social mores.</p>
            <p><b>8) The Illusion of Ineptness</b> - A sometimes very effective 
              limited use ploy, particularly effective in <b>swccg.</b></p>
            <p>This opponent will usually tell you how bad they are, and make 
              you feel sorry for them, they may even make an intentional small 
              "mistake". Beware this can often be a ruse to lull you into overconfidence. 
              Most of us feel sorry for the new guy, or the guy who has recently 
              started and humbly wants to improve, so we often "take it easy" 
              on them, to be a sportsman. Also, since in swccg, differencial can 
              be important, in a game you feel you have won, so you may stop picking 
              up cards for fear they will be caught in your hand. But when your 
              guard is down, BANG out comes the smack down.</p>
            <p>&#9;Story: Out local tournament director, Rob, and I were involved 
              in a game, i was still somewhat new to the scene, although i felt 
              i was becoming a strong player. I had the upper hand with my empire 
              deck, and Rob was telling me how much he "sucked", that this is 
              why he always did bad in tournaments, he never got to play enough... 
              . he even missed a force drain or two, in retrospect, perhaps on 
              purpose. I stopped deploying, for he was down to about 15 life force, 
              and I had all his mains locked up at Obi-wans hut, and despite their 
              sabers and profeciencies, my space based imperial decree negated 
              those Bonuses and I was draining from the Jundland wastes and The 
              cantina. Just when i relaxed my guard, Out it came, Nabrun leids 
              to the cantina, where Motti, and another decent character were, 
              i missed sensing it, BOOM, Gift of the Mentor, Don't get Cocky, 
              Courage of a skywalker(luke ended up like power 12), Jedi presence 
              all my guys hit and forfeit 0! I had NEVER seen that before. I threw 
              out almost 40 force, and picked up the rest. In one fell swoop, 
              I was gone. Brilliant.</p>
            <p>&#9;To guard against this, watch out when someone is telling you 
              they stink, or they make mistakes and lament them. Don't let your 
              mind slip, stay in the game, especially if it looks like a type 
              of deck that could deal out a lot of battle damage. If you want 
              to use this, it can win you a game, but it'll only work once, MAYBE 
              twice against the same player. If things are going against you, 
              you might try this and hope for a home-run. After all what's one 
              force drain or spending a couple extra force, if you deal out 40 
              points of battle damage. Remember, though, this is not a long term 
              strategy.</p>
            <p><b>9) The Wall</b> - The so called "Pokerface". I'm putting this 
              last, because it's probably the best. This person will show no emotion 
              no matter what happens, not rude, angry or happy. I think many of 
              the top players use this mindset. Consider this, if high stakes 
              poker players, who are playing for a lot more than a t-shirt use 
              this, there has to be merit to it. </p>
            <p>&#9;Another story: Last years regionals, deck tech correspondent 
              Mike Fitzgerald(he talks about his anti-jp deck in this issues article, 
              and this was the same one) against the previous years champ, Rusty 
              Zion, playing in the title match. Mike was playing anti-JP mains, 
              Rusty playing JP-manipulator. Mike was gaining the upper hand, when 
              he plays a Grimtaash lost on Rusty. Rusty loses about 8 cards(!) 
              Scanning Crews, and Dangerous Times. At this point, I'd have cracked, 
              I'd have said "oh crap", something, but Rusty just puts out the 
              cards and doesn't even look up. Mike, with no emotion, says, "I'd 
              like to see the rest of your hand". It was beautiful, on both parts.</p>
            <p>&#9;There is generally no counter to this strategy, because to 
              a skilled player of this style, it's nearly impossible to make them 
              crack, they will ignore everything. At least, they generally don't 
              even try to psych you out as well. As for playing this, it's a great 
              way to play, but it takes a LOT of concentration and skill, and 
              it is, to me, mentally taxing as well. If you can pull it off, try 
              it.</p>
            <p>&#9;Ok, last section is a concept I've been considering recently, 
              and that is the power of duplicity, trickery and "bluffing". Once 
              again, I'm looking to high stakes poker. We all have tried this 
              at one time or another, even if it's asking "How many cards are 
              in your hand?" when there is not a monnok in your deck. I think 
              there is a tremendous amount of game-swaying power here, because 
              often these will almost give you the benefits of extra cards in 
              your deck, such as the afforementioned line. You might play a surprise 
              assault, get an exceptionally good draw, and say "Oh yeah, my deck 
              is all 5 and 6's" when in reality of course it's not. You then leave 
              a force down every turn. It doesn't matter whether you have a surprise 
              assault or not, your opponent won't drain, unless he thinks he can 
              thwart it, or somehow look at your hand. So what I'm looking for 
              I guess are ways you guys have found to outtrick your opponent without 
              just going into a pych routine. I'll start it off, and it's my last 
              story</p>
            <p>&#9;I was playing a hidden base, and it was coming out unusally 
              fast. Unbeknowst to my opponent, I had already deployed my hidden 
              base, as well as the requisite battlegrounds, but did not flip the 
              objective. Why? I was in no serious force drain danger yet, and 
              i had another system in my hand, let's say "Anoat". So, here you 
              go, i began muttering, drawing cards and breathed a sigh of relief 
              after a couple cards and stopped drawing. My turn rolls around, 
              I promptly deploy "Anoat" from my hand, and flipped the objective. 
              Now where do you think he deployed his first and only starship to 
              to probe. Of course, "Anoat". There's no card in existence which 
              can duplicate this effect! With the power of my trickery, I caused 
              a large squandering of resources.</p>
            <p>&#9;So wrapping it up, I'm very interested in other specific instances 
              of this sort of thing, or general rules, I think they are even more 
              effective than the psych-out routines mentioned above, as they should 
              work on nearly any player. The sneakier the better. Please respond 
              to David or myself on this article, I'd like to see what kind of 
              followups you have, and we will post them next issue. I further 
              wish to state, I never would have posted this to a general audience, 
              only to deck tech, because of the quality of players I have seen 
              here, and some of the benefits I have already received.</p>
            <p>&#9;Conclusion: The mind is a terrible thing to waste someone with. 
              It is a potent pychological weapon. Be prepared to maximize yours 
              and counter his.</p>

            <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size=5>The Ingredients of an Excellent 
              SW: CCG Player. <br>
              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>By David M. Akers</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>If you want to bake a cake you need to know a few things first. 
              The first thing you need is to know is the ingredients. After you 
              know what ingredients are needed then you need to know what to do 
              with them. By using this simple method you can bake a cake that 
              reasonably resembles the original, again and again. This is what 
              is called duplication. </p>
            <p>Duplication is simply the ability to replicate an object or outcome 
              time and time again. Scientist use this concept as their framework 
              for proving theories. In order for something to be considered proven 
              it must be able to be duplicated time and time again.</p>
            <p>If your goal is to become a excellent SW: CCG player then there 
              are certain ingredients that you should be aware of that can be 
              found in almost every excellent SW: CCG player. This article list 
              the top 5 ingredients that are found in most excellent SW: CCG players. 
              Study them, analyze them, adapt them, and assimilate them. What 
              ever you do incorporate them into yourself and you to will become 
              an excellent player. </p>
            <p><b>Determination</b> – If when you loose (and you will, everyone 
              does) you get discouraged and sulk or quit, if you use SW: CCG as 
              another way to reinforce your already negative self-image, you will 
              never be an excellent SW: CCG player. </p>
            <p>If however your turn your losses into fuel that drives you harder 
              and faster to practice and study, then even in defeat you will become 
              a better player. It doesn’t matter if you win or loose a determined 
              player will evolve. Just remember the goal, it’s not to win a game 
              or a tournament, but to improve! Be determined to improve with every 
              tournament, every game, every win, every loss, every character you 
              deploy, every force you activate. Be determined to become better 
              and you will become an excellent SW: CCG player.</p>
            <p><b>Teachable</b> – If you can not be taught you will never become 
              an excellent SW: CCG player. If you are the only one that can teach 
              you, you will never become an excellent SW: CCG player. You must 
              not only be able to learn from yourself, through your own mistakes, 
              but you must also be able to learn from the mistakes of others and 
              the lessons they have to teach. </p>
            <p>There are simply way too many possible mistakes for you to learn 
              them all from experience. Learn from those better than you what 
              you should do. Learn from those worse than you what you should not 
              do. Absorb their knowledge like a sponge. There is no shame in admitting 
              someone else knows more than you do. In fact there is liberation 
              in such genuine humility. Liberation to improve and evolve. Without 
              such humility and teachability, you will grow stagnant as a player, 
              and old, and eventually obsolete.</p>
            <p><b>Know Thyself</b> – If you can not take an objective look and 
              honest look at yourself the SW: CCG player you might not ever reach 
              excellence. Take an honest look at your strengths and weaknesses. 
              See what are your best qualities and play to maximize your strengths 
              and minimize your weaknesses. </p>
            <p>Excellent players practice the skills that they are weakest in 
              first, fearful players continually practice their strengths and 
              ignore the weakness. It is their Achilles heel, it is what prevents 
              them from reaching true excellence. To be truly great you must come 
              to grips with your personal weaknesses, acknowledge them, but refuse 
              to let them master you. Master your weaknesses. Everyone has a weakness, 
              the excellent players are aware of theirs and know how to minimize 
              it, in doing so they become able to more clearly see the weakness 
              of others and ultimately exploit them.</p>
            <p><b>Emotional Detachment</b> – Anger, Fear, Hate these are the enemies 
              of an excellent SW: CCG player. To become a truly excellent player 
              you must not let your emotions interfere with your discussions. 
              Master your emotions. Tame them as if they were an dangerous animal 
              that is out of control. </p>
            <p>More players have lost to this weakness than from forgetting to 
              force drain. I am not saying excellent players play like robots. 
              They have learned to subdue their emotions and use them as internal 
              energy. They are not flustered or upset, angry or sad. Once you 
              let your emotions cloud your judgement you have already lost.</p>
            <p><b>Sense of Humor</b> – Finally to be able to properly implement 
              any of the above a player must have a sense of humor. Many people 
              will skip over this but this is perhaps the most important of them 
              all. It is what enables the others. Laugh at yourself every once 
              and a while. Laugh at the lone jawa facing down Obi – Wan. Have 
              fun. It is the vent you need to release that excess pressure and 
              it’s a way to find really enjoyable moments in the game. Once and 
              awhile you need to forget about your rating, forget about winning, 
              just concentrate on having fun. Ratings are counterproductive to 
              an excellent player anyway. Sabotage your rating every once and 
              a while and keep yourself honest. But more importantly try to have 
              fun and find moments not be serious at all. </p>
            <p>By incorporating these qualities into yourself, you will become 
              an excellent SW: CCG player.</p>

            <p><font face="Haettenschweiler" size=5>What makes a good tournament 
              player?</font><font size=2><br>
              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>By Michael Hawly</font></p>
            <p><font size=2><br>
              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>Well first let's define 
              our terms. What is meant by a "good tournament player?" Given the 
              focus of the deck tech newsletter, I assume that 'good tournament 
              player' means a player who wins or finishes in the top few players 
              at most of the tournaments he or she enters. While I will focus 
              on the characteristics that help players win, I have to say that 
              winning does not make you a 'good tournament player.' I am tempted 
              to rant about sportsmanship here ... consider yourself ranted at. 
              <br>
              <br>
              There are two general qualities that make a winning tournament player 
              -- preparedness and presence of mind. I'll address preparedness 
              first. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Deck building:</b><br>
              Deck building is the obvious part of preparedness. A winning player 
              is aware of what deck types are available and popular and can adapt 
              a deck to suit his/her own style of play and to respond to the types 
              of decks he/she is likely to play. A really good player will have 
              some element of surprise or uniqueness to his/her decks which make 
              them challenging for even an experienced opponent. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Knowledge of the cards:</b> <br>
              Knowledge of the cards gives you the universe of possibilities. 
              Obviously this will help with your deck building. Is there a card 
              that achieves your goal, which is more efficient or has a higher 
              destiny than the one you saw in that deck posting? The better your 
              knowledge of the cards the better your chances of making good choices. 
              It will also give you a better idea of what to worry about during 
              the game. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Knowledge of the rules:</b> <br>
              This sounds trivial but we all know that the rules are not simple 
              nor are they intuitive. Often, when I add a new strategy to a deck, 
              I E-mail the tournament director to get an advance ruling and confirm 
              the ruling in<br>
              person on the day of the tournament. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Knowledge of local trends:</b> <br>
              What decks/cards to people play/fear. What is the local approach 
              to SAC and Grimnok. Local trends are of supreme importance. I play 
              in Kashyyk, which deck-wise is a bit of a backwater. A while back, 
              when the JP Manipulator deck took the world by storm, nobody played 
              it around here. I'm not sure why. But, if you were watching the 
              web sites, you would have built one of the many anti-manipulator 
              decks and been in for a big surprise when you started with the Throne 
              Room and the dark side started with the Death Star.<br>
              <br>
              Next I will address presence of mind. Presence of mind is what makes 
              the difference in a game where the decks are well matched and neither 
              player has overwhelmingly good or bad luck. It keeps a player from 
              losing due to avoidable factors. It expands winning differentials 
              and trims losing differentials.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Adaptability:</b><br>
              The best players can respond to a game that has not unfolded according 
              to plan. They can spot a weakness in the opponents’ deployment and 
              exploit it. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Focus:</b> <br>
              I think the most important thing for a tournament player to remember 
              is to be in the game at all times. Concentration is the hallmark 
              of the very best players. A great player will often be able to tell 
              you his/her destiny numbers before drawing them -- and then tell 
              you yours! Good players count their cards and track their destinies. 
              They don't let their opponents’ switch from one phase to another 
              without giving them an opportunity to play a card or perform an 
              action. They don't forget anything. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Tenacity:</b> <br>
              It is very important to play each game to the finish. There is something 
              to be learned even in a humiliating defeat. Good players don't concede 
              defeat until defeat is inevitable. Even then they look for ways 
              to minimize the damage. They also continue to size up their opponents’ 
              deck to see if there are ways to counter it that they hadn't thought 
              of. Contrariwise, a great player never relaxes his grip on a worthy 
              opponent. There is always a danger that an opponent will mount an 
              unexpected comeback. That said, (sportsmanship rant warning!!!) 
              it is important not to rub your opponent's face in it. I consider 
              it a sign of respect for my opponent to treat me as potentially 
              dangerous even when I am down. I am an adult and I have confidence 
              in my abilities. A good player gives the newer, younger, or weaker 
              players a break. If they seem receptive, a good player will talk 
              strategy, make suggestions, answer their questions. I have been 
              on the receiving end of this many times. I was fortunate to have 
              been exposed to many decent players like this before I met up with 
              my first egotistical newbie crusher. <br>
              <br>
              Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on what makes a good tournament 
              player. I hope you can use them.<br>
              <br>
              Thanks,<br>

            <p>Tips to Remember When Playing in a SWCCG Tournament</p>
            </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>By John Carr</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size=5><br>
              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2><br>
              1. Have a good understanding of all cards that you have included 
              in your deck. This means make sure you know by memory both sides 
              of your objectives and any other cards you are using.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p><br>
              2. Don't be afraid to read an opponent's card. This cost me in my 
              first tournament. I was playing an "Asteroid Sanctuary" deck and 
              completely forgot to draw for Asteroid destiny. My opponent not 
              only caused me to lose three force a turn from AS, but was also 
              able to force drain me with a lone X-wing because I never attempted 
              to knock it out with Asteroid destiny.</p>
            <p><br>
              3. Any time you don't understand a rule, or a card, ask your Tournament 
              Director to explain.</p>
            <p><br>
              4. Try to make your deck so that you can compete against some of 
              the common tournament decks in your area. You won't be able to counter 
              every strategy, so don't focus too many cards to shutting other 
              people down, but always be prepared for anything.</p>
            <p><br>
              5. Decks that are popular today, won't necessary be popular next 
              month. If it has been awhile since your last tournament, try to 
              find out what decks are being played in tournaments. Check the BBS 
              or other SWCCG websites(editor: or <b>Deck Tech</b>!) that post 
              tournament-worthy decks. This will give you some<br>
              idea of what you might be up against.</p>
            <p><br>
              6. Remember, no matter how good of a player you are, you won't be 
              able to win every single game.</p>
            <p><br>
              7. Be a gracious loser. Congradulate your opponent, and prepare 
              for the next round.</p>
            <p><br>
              8. Don't whine about how broken a card is, or how insanely powerful 
              a deck is. SWCCG is a game based on Star Wars, but not every game 
              will unfold exactly like the movies.</p>
            <p><br>
              9. If you didn't win the tournament, ask the winner what decks he 
              played with. This should help you out in future tournaments.</p>
            <p><br>
              10. Have fun playing! That's what games are for.<br>
              <br>

              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>By Mike Fitzgerald</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p><b>Dedication- </b><br>
              To be a good player you have to want to be a good player. Your showing 
              that you want to be a good player by simply reading this issue of 
              DeckTech. I consider myself to be a 'good' player. I probably spend 
              at least 10 hours a week searching the Web and various discussion 
              lists looking for new and exciting info and strategies. This number 
              of hours usually doubles and sometimes comes close to tripling when 
              Regionals come around. Take advantage of local gaming nights or 
              , if your like me , try to find a friend and just keep testing new 
              decks against each other with new info you've heard about. What 
              I'm surprised about is that many players don't read Tournament Reports. 
              I think Tournament Reports are where it is at. As long as the writer 
              keeps it interesting and can give a good general description of 
              the decks being played then it is a very valuable metagame asset. 
              The toughest part of dedication is playing when your getting a little 
              bored with the game. I like to create fun decks just for situations 
              to keep me interested. Also , when you've played about 10 games 
              in a row and you keep testing the same decks against each other 
              you get kinda bored quickly too. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Confidence-</b> </p>
            <p>You shouldn't walk into any game and think your gonna get killed 
              or just wipe the guy off the table. Try to keep an even flow mentality 
              . If your gonna make a mistake just overestimate the opponent instead 
              of underestimating the opponent. Upsets will happen , thats why 
              we play the game instead of giving the player with the higher ranking 
              the win. I get pumped up when I play high rated and considered elite 
              players because I feel something special is gonna happen ( see a 
              new deck style , cards being used like never before , or the chance 
              of me winning ) . I try to use fun decks at tournaments once in 
              awhile to keep myself from worrying about my rating and testing 
              the current scene. Two weeks before Regionals last year I brought 
              2 decent Hoth Clouds decks and I got smashed by 34 and 35 so then 
              I decided that those weren't gonna cut it so I had to get into the 
              JP / Anti-JP scene. Also , ratings mean very little. Use it to feel 
              proud of yourself once in awhile but don't go to far. Right after 
              Special Edition I played against a player with about a 1420 rating 
              and I managed to battle it out 48 minutes and get a 1 card win. 
              That was the toughest 2 points of my life , against someone in all 
              aspects I was expected to crush off the table ( never mind that 
              is was a HBase deck ;). The first time that I seriously traveled 
              to a top notch tournament ( besides my local area ) was going down 
              to play v. Gabriel Alonso in Miami. I got to play him with my Darkside 
              ( which I considered my best deck at the time -- side note : don't 
              favor one deck over the other ) . I played one of my most memorable 
              games and managed to beat him by 1. He smashed every character I 
              put out while I wasn't knocking any characters of his out. I managed 
              to shake it off and beat him because I kept my head in the game. 
              I truly believe that confidence will help differentiate between 
              players of equal ability ( if there is such a thing ). <br>
              <br>
              <b>Patience-</b> </p>
            <p>I believe this is the greatest asset to a good player. You and 
              your opponent are both gonna make mistakes. The question is who 
              can exploit the mistake to the fullest for the win. I'm gonna use 
              extreme examples of myself since I know myself the best. I don't 
              like babbling over and over about past <br>
              Regionals but it helps make my point. In the '97 Dagobah Regionals 
              I was 2-0 and was the 2nd highest player after those 2 games. I 
              played against Brett Helgeson's LS EBO / Droids deck. I was using 
              a Tatooine Drain. I got Vader down to the 4th Marker early and was 
              doing little damage to him ( couldn't find sites ). He was mowing 
              through his deck with How Did We Get Into This Mess , I hadn't seen 
              that before. I got so frustrated because he was just going through 
              his deck at will and I had seen only maybe 20% of the deck and most 
              of it was on the way to the lost pile. Well he had Do or Do not 
              on Table and a grappler on a Sense. Out of feeling helpless I let 
              a Sense fly and cancelled his HDWGITM. He just proceeded to play 
              another. I lost that game by 2 Force. The 2 Force that I lost for 
              wasting that Sense would've saved me the game. Patience. But now 
              well go out of the gloom and doom to the better times. '98 Dagobah 
              Regional. I'm playing v. Rusty Zion's JP Manipulator. He starts 
              with TiNT and has loads of ADT , Voyeurs , and SCrews. He starts 
              right off the bat with manipulation of my interrupt heavy deck. 
              All I do is smirk while he picks works my deck around and tries 
              to get into my head. Somehow I manage to fight him off with the 
              strength of Shocking Info and Grimtaash. I was surprised that I 
              didn't flip out and get impatient because that was a mental exhausting 
              game ( I must've handed my force pile over to ADT about 20 times 
              ) where my patience made the difference. </p>

            <p>I think my biggest weakness is…</p>
            </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>By Tony Harris</p>
            <p>I think my biggest weakness is wearing down in long tournaments. 
              I have in the past played mind intensive decks barawains, off the 
              edge, training, dark side asteriods, etc. decks that are sneaky. 
              All require the setting up of the victim, running, and catching 
              them in a mistake. I played them on both sides. It isn’t hard to 
              play the first two hours but the next two or four can tire me and 
              I forget stupid things like moving undercover spies or canceling 
              force drains. These all can cost you the game in time and I hate 
              losing when I did something wrong to give them the win. </p>
            <p>I have played in a lot of tournaments most of them in magic, but 
              a good amount in star wars and I can tell you from experience that 
              wearing down becomes really important, where the later rounds are 
              the harder players and how you play can decide if you win the tournament 
              or not. </p>
            <p>Here is my remedy. Play a deck lighter on really hard decisions 
              like operatives or hidden base swarm or mindless abyssins and on 
              the other side you can play the complex. My last tournament I played 
              maelstrom local uprising (easy to play) and on the dark, I played 
              a tight ground pounder on dark. I did well and by the last 2 game 
              I was still tired mentally but I played perfect games. It doesn’t 
              matter if I won or lost what matters that they had to play me to 
              beat me. </p>

            <p>Meta is a short way to say to sum up the decks that are viable 
              in the current enviroment. This section looks at different components 
              that makes some strategies viable and others not. This issue we 
              will take a look at the issue of Sense and Alter in the Current 
              Enviroment. Take a look and see what conclusion you come too.</p>

              Vader and Tarkin?<br>
              </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2>By Paul Maholick</font></p>
            <font face="Arial Narrow"> There was a time when nothing created greater 
            fear in the heart of a LS player as when Vader and Tarkin hit the 
            table together. The power 10, ability 9, destiny draw canceling combo 
            was once the best in the game. It forced the LS do generally do one 
            of two things, either 1) concede a force drain of two or three a turn 
            (compliments of Vader’s Saber) or 2) Muster up some mains, toys and/or 
            destiny adders to fight it out, committing resources that might be 
            better spent elsewhere. It seems that things have changed, even though 
            this combo remains competitive, it just doesn’t have the kick it once 
            had nor inspire the fear it once did. Why is this? </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size=2> 
            <p>The First Shot </p>
            <p>I believe that technically Demotion should be considered the first 
              attempt to reign in this combo. Certainly the card had other uses, 
              but its foremost duty was to cancel Tarkin’s game text. However, 
              its susceptibility to Alter proved to be its undoing. It could not 
              be counted on in the heavy Sense/ Alter days of pre-Dagobah, and 
              even after DODN it did not fair that well. Today it is more of a 
              trivia question than a viable strategy, and is most likely destined 
              to never again receive tournament consideration. In fact the only 
              time you will hear the card mentioned these days is in a conversation 
              such as this one.</p>
            <p>(Two Players opening packs of Premiere after a tournament)</p>
            <p>Player One: What did you pull in your pack? Anything good?</p>
            <p>Player Two: No, another Demotion</p>
            <p>It All Started to Fall Apart on Cloud City</p>
            <p>Cloud City gave us the second blow against the mighty Vader/ Tarkin 
              combo. And a powerful blow it was, as from this point on, it all 
              went downhill for this Imperial duo. Uncontrollable Fury is a card 
              that really penalizes the use of Vader. Besides canceling the destiny 
              canceling mechanism, Vader is in jeopardy of causing the DS player 
              to lose two force each turn if the LS has a character of greater 
              than 3 ability on the table. The DS does get something from the 
              card though, a +2 boost to Vader’s power, but it is hardly compensation 
              for what is lost. True, you can avoid the loss my battling every 
              turn, but once Uncontrollable Fury is played the LS generally takes 
              a hands-off policy toward Vader, preferring to reap the benefits 
              of what amounts to an extra force drain of two each turn . This 
              leaves Elis Helrot as the DS’s only recourse to "get it on." But 
              Elis is not without its own risk, as it can be Sensed, or Quite 
              a Mercenaried. And if you actual initiate battle you have to face 
              the reality that you can’t cancel a destiny draw now anyway. At 
              this point the DS generally throws in the towel, loses Vader, and 
              if lucky deploys an another from hand. If unlucky, Uncontrollable 
              Fury continues to eat away at the DS, taking its toll over the course 
              of the game.. </p>
            <p>Luckily for the DS, Uncontrollable Fury does have a counter, You 
              Are Beaten. A powerful interrupt in its own right, YAB is the only 
              thing that gets rid of this irksome effect as it is immune to Alter. 
              Unfortunately YAB is not immune to sense, so canceling Uncontrollable 
              Fury is not a sure thing. Truly, Uncontrollable Fury is an evil 
              LS card.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Its Worse</p>
            <p>When Jabba’s Palace hit the scene, it had no real effect on the 
              Vader/ Tarkin combo. Certainly DS decks were becoming more alien 
              based, but Vader and Tarkin still showed up in Jabba’s Palace, Scum 
              and Villainy be damned. Overall, Jabba’s Palace did little to hurt 
              the combo. But the same can not be said for Special Edition.</p>
            <p>SE’s objectives changed the game. Far-reaching global "effects" 
              have come to dominate the tournament environment. Because of the 
              LS’s ability to make your force drains –1 everywhere or cancel drains 
              outright with Hidden Base, the ability to control a single site 
              with the duo becomes less of an advantage. Having Vader and Tarkin 
              at a site no longer equates to steady draining for the DS anymore. 
            </p>
            <p>Next, EPP’s make the combo’s ability to cancel a destiny draw less 
              relevant. Get EPP Luke, Han and Leia together and the LS is drawing 
              three destinies already, god forbid the LS is packing destiny adders. 
              So how do you use your canceling ability? Do you cancel a weapon 
              destiny and hope the others miss? Do you wait and cancel the highest 
              destiny draw for attrition that you can find? There is no good answer 
              here. Pass up the weapon draws and most likely Tarkin is going to 
              forfeit for 0, if not Vader as well. Cancel the first weapon hit 
              and the others might still get you. Or if you play it "safe" and 
              cancel an attrition draw the other two might exceed six (Tarkin’s 
              forfeit if it is not 0) and cause both Tarkin and Vader to be lost. 
              Lets face it, with the LS having a chance at so many more destiny 
              draws, the ability to cancel one is nice, but certainly not the 
              game breaker it once was.</p>
            <p>If you put all of these together, the situation is bleak. Instead 
              of being a sure damage dealer, Vader and Tarkin are now a target. 
              They can neither drain as effectively given the LS’s potential use 
              of objectives, nor can they battle as effectively as they once could, 
              given their souped-up opposition. To make matters worse Vader remains 
              a target for Uncontrollable Fury, possibly costing you force for 
              even deploying him. No, this is not your father’s Vader/Tarkin combo. 
              This is much worse</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Help Me HDADTJ, You’re My Only Hope</p>
            <p>With all this gloom and doom, I thought it was my duty to leave 
              you with just a bit of hope. HDADTJ, the Vader player’s dream card, 
              breathes a bit of life back into the combo. With the card on the 
              0 side you can pick Vader up and stick him in your hand. When you 
              do this, all cards deployed on him, including your opponents go 
              back to the owners used pile. So long Uncontrollable Fury. Or if 
              the objective is one the 7 side you can play YAB with worrying about 
              a LS Sense ruining your cancellation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, now that you can start an epic duel during a battle, 
              you can use Tarkin to cancel a duel destiny. It makes dueling much 
              easier. Imagine the situation. You have Vader and Tarkin across 
              from SOS, Han with Blaster and Leia with Blaster. Generally this 
              would be very bad news. You initiate battle and start a duel with 
              Son of Skywalker. You cancel the five he drew, leaving him with 
              three. You win the duel easily and Luke crosses over. Now you have 
              to worry about the battle, with the LS getting two destiny draws 
              (it was three before the battle) and some weapons destinies. Sure, 
              Tarkin is most likely going to get shot. Unfortunate? Yes, but he 
              served his purpose and made the LS lose 5 cards and Luke, certainly 
              a good trade for Tarkin. You have one more surprise though. You 
              play Dark Jedi Presence. That is a 15 point power swing and will 
              make the battle much less pleasant for the LS. Net result is that 
              the LS went from having three destiny draws and three weapons with 
              12 power, to now having 8 power, two destiny draws and two weapons. 
              They also have already lost 5 force before the battle. With DJP, 
              the DS has one destiny draw, and 24 power. Not a bad deal. And with 
              the objective now flipped to the 7 side, you can sense those nasty 
              destiny adders they were playing to play. Yes, the LS could still 
              get lucky and hit Tarkin and Luke, but with your higher power, you 
              will not lose the battle and Vader will survive to ensure Visage 
              damage as the LS scrambles to draw for more firepower. HDADTJ doesn’t 
              solve all your problems, but it sure can help.</p>
            <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p>The Vader/Tarkin combo has been weakened with time. Due to the 
              effect of Uncontrollable Fury and the SE trend toward global force 
              drain modification and the direct canceling of drains, having Vader 
              and Tarkin at a site together just doesn’t yield you as much as 
              it once did. In fact it may end up costing you. Once extremely effective, 
              the combo is now just a "nice to do." Outside of the HDADTJ environment 
              take care when playing the combo. You always had a big target on 
              your chest, only now the LS has additional and indeed larger guns. 
              However, in the right deck, with the right support cards, and a 
              bit of luck, the combo can still be deadly. </p>

            <p>By Michael Josem</p>
            <p>Is it possible to build a deck that is able to deal with X-Wing 
              swarms, Operatives, and EPP Swarms?<br>
              <br>
              Dark Side ground decks have a serious problem currently, because 
              Obi-Wan + Luke + Chewie + Han + COAS + Jedi Presence (not a difficult 
              combo to achieve with 4 of each in your deck), will give you a total 
              power of 45. Throw in a Draw Their Fire (Signaled for at the start 
              of the game) and a Frozen Assets, and the DS _will_ lose a minimum 
              of 25 force.<br>
              <br>
              Dark Side space has serious problems against Operatives - the -1 
              drain is an absolute bitch to avoid - The maximum possible drain 
              is 4, excluding odd occurences such as Alderaan. Since I've only 
              just thought of it, is Alderaan viable? How about we build a CPI 
              deck that has a chance against Ops..... But wait! Then you get smashed 
              by EPP Swarms. Oh well, it was a nice idea.<br>
              <br>
              So, how on earth do we deal with these stupid EPP Swarms?<br>
              <br>
              Let's look at what they're dependent upon:<br>
              1) A big battle<br>
              2) Lots of Rebel mains<br>
              3) Frozen Assets, or the DS player not having a Ghhhk<br>
              4) Having something to beat down upon.<br>
              <br>
              Hence, how do we stop any one of those things from occuring (we 
              only need to block one)<br>
              <br>
              1) A Big Battle<br>
              What ways do the DS have of stopping a big battle? The only possibility 
              that I can think of is 'Projective Telepathy,' which will only work 
              if the LS has little/no force active. It is possible that it might 
              stop the Jedi Presence. However, Frozen Assets/DTF blocks this option. 
              <br>
              <br>
              2) Lots of Rebel Mains<br>
              This appears to be the weakpoint of the Maelstrom/EPP Swarm decks 
              - If you can stop the LS from amassing enough cards to do the beatdown. 
              So, what are the options available?<br>
              a) Monnok. The used function of this will prevent the LS player 
              from having more than 12 cards in hand. If you time this correctly 
              (after the first character of the beatdown has been deployed), with 
              a bit of luck you should be able to set up your own beatdown, if 
              hopefully you have disrupted enough cards from the opponent's hand. 
              Otherwise, there is nothing to stop the LS player from drawing up 
              again next turn. Monnok also has an advantage in that it costs nothing 
              to play - You can play it even if the first part of the beatdown 
              is the Frozen Assets.<br>
              b) Scanning Crew. This is often found in decks with around 10 copies, 
              which is nice, however this isn't quite as strong because: 1) It 
              requires a force to play and 2) Is less versatile against Operatives 
              and HBX and 3) It gets hurt pretty majorly by Shocking Information 
              <br>
              <br>
              3) Frozen Assets, or the DS player not having a Ghhhk This isn't 
              quite so easy to avoid. Firstly, to be guaranteed of having a Ghhhk 
              in your hand, you're looking at stacking 3/4 Ghhks plus Masterful 
              Moves in your deck. In combination with this, you are required to 
              have some defence against Frozen Assets, and if it is interrupt 
              based (such as Alter or Imperial Supply), (and I can't think of 
              anything non-interrupt based either) then you need to play it before 
              the battle begins, and then give the LS player the choice of whether 
              to continue. To stop the beatdowns, you<br>
              need to take control of the game, and to make sure that the LS player 
              is reactive to your moves, and this doesn't cut it.<br>
              <br>
              4) Having something to beat down upon.<br>
              Obviously, the LS needs something to beat down. If you are able 
              to prevent the LS from deploying to where you have characters, then 
              they could be in for a bit of trouble. Let's look at the possibilities: 
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Using sites with no LS force icons. Too hard to defend - Any 
                LS player worth his salt will be playing with Nabrun or Spies 
                or preferably both. I do not think that it is feasible to have 
                a copy of Revealed in hand every turn, nor to block multiple Nabruns</li>
              <li>Using JP Sites with None Shall Pass. These things are only worthwhile 
                in large numbers, and are frighteningly vulnerable to Grimtaash. 
                You will also require one every turn for the Obi-Wan, and the 
                force advantage this card generates isn't really effective, since 
                all but the most poorly designed Beatdown decks will have ample 
                force generation. Playing in Space/in the Clouds. This seems to 
                be the easiest, and most fool-proof method - If you do not deploy 
                anything to the ground, you can't get smashed. But space decks 
                have a chronic problem against Operatives....<br>
                <br>
                This game is far too similar to Rock/Paper/Scissors (talking of 
                which, I've discovered that playing R/P/S against yourself is 
                a great way of alleviating boredom)<br>
                <br>
                Have a good one,</li>
            </ol>
