<tr><td colspan=2><font color=#FFFFFF face="arial" size="2"><img src=/news/images/david.gif align="left">Thats me in the photo. Im David Akers and this is the first time in the history of DeckTech that I have written an editorial. As if any one cares, right? But hey I started this little site years ago so I might as well voice my opinion on this whole license debacle right? I mean, I have as much or more money invested in SW:CCG cards as anyone else, so I figure that entitles me to at least an opinion on the subject. <br>
<br>
I could sense this was coming. Though I had no substantial proof, I could feel the disturbance in the force. A few things here and there tipped me off. I remained quiet about it, of course. In the past I felt like every time I said anything that could be construed as bad or negative, I would be labeled as anti-decipher and everything I said was just disregarded without consideration. <br>
<br>
So I stayed quiet. I mean by the time I figured out Decipher was going to lose the license it was too late to do anything about it anyway. So why rock the boat and ruin the fun from the last few sets by announcing an imminent doom of the game when most people wouldnt believe me anyway right?<br>
<br>
One of the reasons I wanted to do FreedomCon was to let everyone have the opportunity to play in one last international event. I even considered promoting it as the last international tournament for SW:CCG. Ha! Could you imagine the outrage Id get from people calling me all kinds of things? <br>
<br>
I digress. So where does this announcement leave us and where do we go from here? <br>
<br>
<B>The Current Game:</B><br>
<br>
Well to be honest things look really bright to me. I mean SW:CCG is currently in pretty good shape. The game is still the best CCG to be developed. Nothing there has changed. The people playing it are still the best fans any CCG has seen. And, of course, DeckTech is still here to discuss everything SW:CCG related and we are not going anywhere. The current environment seems fun and doesnt appear broken to me.  <br>
<br>
So other than not getting new product what much has changed?<br>
<br>
Tournament support? In my opinion, all of the major tournaments for SW:CCG in 2001 that amounted to anything were run and sponsored by DeckTech. DeckTech gave away more in cash and prizes in 2001 to SW:CCG players than Decipher. Heck, I think even WotC gave away more in prizes to SW:CCG players than Decipher did in 2001 (how much do those tournament foils cost anyway?)  So in other words, player organized groups are more than capable of hosting large events and tournament circuits.<br>
<br>
So other than not getting new product what else has changed?<br>
<br>
Volunteers? I think Decipher is still going to continue their Squadron Member program so you should still be able to play tournaments and have rankings updated just as before, for a while at least. <br>
<br>
So other than not getting new cards not much has changed. <br>
<br>
If you want to keep playing SW:CCG there is nothing to prevent you from doing so. The game only dies when you stop playing. If this player committee takes off then there might even be the opportunity to vary the playing environment and keep things continually new!<br>
<br>
So look into being on the player committee and look for ways to keep the game alive.   <br>
<br>
<B>The New Game:</B><br>
<br>
Im not into kiddy games so if its like roll a dice or flip a coin to see whos Jedi has more force this turn, then I dont think Im going to like it too much. Having said that it doesnt seem fair to pre-judge a card game based on hearing there is dice in it. I mean Magi Nation Duel has a dice mechanic but it is still very strategic and overall an excellent game. I highly recommend checking it out if you never have before.<br>
<br>
Oh where was I. Oh yeah. I have never played a WotC game competitively before so I dont have all these negative conceptions (either justly or unjustly) about them as a company. I know they must have offered quite a bit for the Star Wars license so that tells me they value the property at least. Considering they also have the Star Wars RPG and Fan Club and SW Gamer Magazine there might be some interesting synergies that can be utilized to make the game and playing it competitively more interesting and rewarding. <br>
<br>
I know they dont have problems giving out cool prizes to the winners of their card games (see FreedomCon). I was very impressed with the people I met from WotC at FreedomCon, they were fun and pleasant. Even the prize ideas (which was all them btw) of Game Cubes and PS2s gave me an indication they know what is fun and what isnt.<br>
<br>
Some people may think we are biased towards WotC because they advertise on the site and sponsored FreedomCon. All I can tell you is that we would take money from any card game maker to advertise on this site, green is green right? WotC is just the only one interested in reaching our members via ads I guess.<br>
<br>
Also none of the prizes donated by WotC went to DeckTech staff. It all went directly (or is going for you international champs) to the players. We didnt see a dime from it.<br>
<br>
<B>Some Other Thoughts:</B><br>
<br>
<B>Future of DeckTech:</B><br>
SW:CCG site will stay up and we will continue to support our current players any way we can.<br>
If the new game doesnt suck we will support that too.<br>
Also look for MND, Raw Deal, Magic in that order coming to you soon!<br>
<br>
<B>Boycott:</B> <br>
Some people say Boycott Wizards and maybe Decipher will get the license back. Hey I know you are upset, but this simply isnt going to happen. If Wizards cant get the SW property to work it will just fall off and might even ring the death Nell for the entire industry. <br>
<br>
So feel free to boycott but at least put as much positive energy into productive things for SW:CCG. Things like the players committee and running tournaments. Because having SW:TCG fail and D getting the property back is as about as likely as your blind date for next Friday turning out to be Britney Spears.<br>
<br>
<B>To Decipher:</B> <br>
Hey I know you guys dont read this site but here is some advice for you anyway. Make a non-licensed game using the SW:CCG mechanics. Its the best game system out there and it would be a shame to let it die completely. <br>
<br>
If you really want to compete with WotC make it a fantasy type theme. With a few modifications it could easily be even better than Star Wars. I think you are mistaken if you think LotR is going to draw a big magic crowd. Its too messy (and will only get messier) and has a limited life span.<br>
<br>
<B>To WotC:</B><br>
Id really like to get a glimpse at the new game so I can ease my fears about the dice-rolling mechanic. Anyone?<br>
 <br>
This is what I think. What do you think?<p><small>edited by David on Sun Jan 6 2002 </small></font></td></tr>

<br>
A couple things I would like to see you comment on:<br>
1.  Do you think the market can support another SW CCG?  I doubt it, since support for YJ (after E1 hype) and JK isn't there.<br>
2.  What do you have to say about WOTC's latest track record w/ NEW games?  I always feel that they screw up in certain areas which lead to the demise of a game.(could be a disertation)<br>
3.  What has the lead game designer done besides M:TG?  (pleading my ignorance... will comment after I know more)<br>
4.  Do you think SW:TCG/LF/WOTC can survive the SW:CCGers sour mood?  I think they will get 25% of SW:CCGers if it is a fair to good game, probably no more than 60% if it is a great game.<br>
5.  What kinda 'normal' prize support does WOTC have?  I've never seen it beside the PRO-Tour....  I believe we were kinda spoiled in the beggining, but who knows what really ended the cool t-shirts....<br>
<br>
I could probably ask 10 more...  I will probably try it, but I have other hobbies I may try now that money has freed up!  <br>

Unless there is some change in game play coming I don't see how moving is gonna be possible. I disagree with the above comment on no expanded universe. Have you read the other Tolkien books? The history of middle-earth and the world of middle-earth itself is enormous. Lots of expansion potential. On the starting a unlicenced game with Star Wars mechanics, I vote Final Fantasy. Talk about expansive universes and fans would love it. Getting to finally see Cecil, Cloud, and the rest all playable at the same time. That would rock!

1. Why not? JK never took off so I don't think there is much compitition from that and YJ took a serious loss after the podracing mechanic so I figure that really there are only two sw games. SW:CCG and SW:TCG and I don't see why the market can't support them both especially considering you don't have to spend any more money to keep playing SW:CCG. <BR><BR><br>
2. Same could be said for quite a few gaming companies. I'm thinking the industry is at a saturation point in general and requires some innovative concepts to reach a new growth level.<BR><BR><br>
3. Don't know someone said Vampire and BattleTech. Anyone else know? <br><br><br>
4. If the game is good I think it will be a success. They have a few good things going for them. There might be some upset players, but many are like me and don't have any problems playing multiple games if they are good.<BR><BR>5. I have no idea about thier "normal prize support". Could it be much less than 2 cards per tournament? Heck even if you pay a buck to play and buy two packs and split it up thats better prize support.

Decipher lost the ability to produce the shirts due to a snag with other licensees who made clothing.

I admit it's not truly an expanded universe but the Silmarillion and the hobbit add two more books to the list of sources and anyone whose read the Silmarillion knows it is long and full of new characters and greater insights into certain characters of the LotR trilogy. When Star Wars started it had basically the three movies to work with and with the exception of a few select cards "Mara Jade for example" the brunt of the cards came from the three classic movies. Sure the new movies added more cards but many were met poorly. Think about it, how many cards came from expanded universe, the back stories to many cards came from them but those characters were in the movies too. Only a select few where from the books. So I personally think that 5 literary sources and 3 movies (lord knows Arwin wouldn't be as cool a card without the movie) is sufficient to let the game have a decent life span so long as the mechanics stay fun and interactive. I mean there are so many characters alone that haven't even been introduced yet. Like Sauron himself, Sarumon, the Balrog, Eowyn, Golem, Faramir, and others. What about the persona of Merry that helps slay the Witch-King himself. The Ents will be cool. I'd also love to see the original lord of darkness Melkor. So if the LotR universe is not expanded, then surely it is at least expansive. And as for the "unlicenced thing", I know, I just don't care. The law though needed and usually just, does oft blow. Anyway, I don't mean to argue, I just want to be understood in my meanings.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>xavier six</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Mon Jan 7 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>What's MND?</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Brandon</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Mon Jan 7 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>magi nation duel</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>hag</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Mon Jan 7 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Nicely put Dave.<br>

Long live SW: CCG!!<br>
Long live Dune: CCG!!<br>
Long live Battletech: CCG!!<br>
<br>
I'm being 100% serious too. I have loved and enjoyed all three of those games, and hope to someday play them with my kids. Just because a game goes out of print, doesn't mean the game stops!!!!<br>
<br>
The only thing that stops is company run tourney support, but honestly if you went down to your local hobby shop with a bunch of people and said.. we want to run a XXXX tournament... do you think they are going to say.. NO? Well at least not the store owners I knwo.<br>
<br>
And as far as making your own SW: CCG world championship? I seem to remember that all you need is a little bit of free table space at GenCon or similar and you can have yourself a nice little tourney. <br>
<br>
I know I did.. It was called the Alphastrike.com World Championships (my old battletech website).. and anyone who heard about it on the site (plus anyone that showed up at gencon) could enter into the tournament... and I even provided prize support.<br>
<br>
So yes.. YOU GO DAVE!!!<br>
<br>
And Decktech.net keep supporting the man. He's doing you a good job.<br>
<br>
My advice to you. Play games that you enjoy playing and don't stop just because they aren't being 'produced' anymore. <br>
<br>
If that were the case, then no one would play half of the board games on my "favorite board games" shelf.<br>
<br>
If SW: TCG comes out and its good? You be your own judge. Thats all any company can ever ask of you. <br>

Long live Decktech.net!!<br>

I played Magic for a long time starting the day Ice Age came out and Juzzams were still $30.00 each and a Lotus could be had for $100.00. lol<br>
<br>
Magic was fun but is ultra competetive and I wouldnt doubt WOTC making SW ultra competetive with its DCI ratings system. I knew quite a few players who were really good back in the day and probably still are (Pete Leiher...Mike Long) among others who simply would not play in any local tournies to protect their rankings so it would take years for a decent player to move up into their league so to speak. Ranking systems and cash prizes force players to do that and its not a healthy thing.<br>
<br>
We all know how competetive SW can be and we have all seen what it does to people including myself. Its not really all that much fun is it? Our last tournament was called End of a reign. There were no rankings at stake...no cash...just show up...play...have fun...and we put together probably the best prize support ever. We all donated from our collections and The Founder released his own personal stash of goodies. It was one of the most fun tournaments I had in Star Wars.<br>
<br>
The bottom line: If a game is fun...I will play it. If it has a bunch of overcompetetive jerk offs in it that cheat and brow beat people...I wont play. Ill work on my GTO and have fun with my family.

WotC Magic Support:<br>
<br>
They send you foil versions of cards (JUST LIKE SOMEONE ELSE?) but insted of being free your local shop has to pay $5 per card. Arena League is $5 per memeber for a store to join, min. 20 memebers. Have fun telling your local shop they have to spend $100 to get prize support for a new game! <br>
<br>
Other than that it's Pro Tour or nothing?<br>
<br>
BTW the ultimate question remains: If WotC cares "SOOOO" much about what Decktech and Wars players think, then why not pay the royalty fee? Everyone has to pay them a fee for "Collectible Trading Card Game" or did you forget they have a patent on it? So again I ask everyone pays them a fee why can't they pay? <br>

Until they answer that with hard fact make mine Decipher and up WotC you know what!<br>

I hope decktech makes a community for dbz and mnd. keep fighting until the very end I will keep playing old wars in my area.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Duo_god_of_Death</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Tue Jan 8 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>I know I have not payed much attention to ST:CCG lately.

I've been giving this a lot of thought and I believe to with the addition of new sets the ways to win will change. Look at Star Wars it had objectives that changed the terms of victory or at least of attaining victory. I believe with each new set the adventure paths can change. In the next two books the paths of the ex-fellowship members diverge a bit but the overall goal is still frodo's success. Think about this idea for a "The Hobbit" expansion. You get a Bilbo that can play as your ring-bearer and your sites 1-9 fit the adventure path of Bilbo's quest. Now more than ever the idea of stay on your adventures path becomes important because you quite literally can get lost in your opponent's sites. Keep in mind that you are not just playing out the movie with the cards, you are charting an adventure (ie. adventure deck) in a very large world. Just cause your trying to stay on your "The Hobbit" sites doesn't mean you won't end off on one of your opponent's "Two Towers" sites. Sure thats not what happened in the books or likely the movies but yeck Luke never dueled Maul in Star Wars did he? As for the no more fellowship thing, think about it. The "fellowship of the ring" was broken not all fellowships in general. I mean Arwen isn't really a member of the "fellowship of the ring" but she can be a part of your fellowship. So I see nothing stopping the mechanics of the game in new expansions. Oh yeah, to the comment above... there are three categorical ring-bearers: Bilbo (three decades?), Frodo (few years under two decades?), and Sam (couple of days?). I would not be surprised if they they didn't get to start as the ring-bearer in the future. Although I shudder to think if Tom (wore it for a minute "unaffected!") ever became one. That would be so unbalanced! Well these are my thoughts anyway.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>xavier six</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Tue Jan 8 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Decipher should use the same Mechanics and get the rights to the Matrix from Warner Bro's...<br>

As far as prizes, I've been using Star Wars collectables to supplement cards as prizes (it's not like a state champ needs another pack of Cloud City but they could use an R2 unit for their desk).  <br>
<br>
Second, as people stop purcahsing packs, the cost of the packs AND singles will go down.  Moreover, with lowering costs and a frequency of singles and collections for sale, new players can get into the game.  If players will take the time to teach new players, it will not be difficult to recruit new players but plan to teach them slowly (introduce one set of rules at a time ).  Particularly when Reflecions II is cheap when you find it.<br>
<br>
Third, many will look at this new position to player leadership in two ways.  First, is that we can do anything we want to from inventing new cards to errataing text.  The second is that we can leave the game as it is and just change how we look at tournaments now that ratings are irrelevent.  This means that prize structure, the use of Entry Fees, the use of scenario tournaments, a closed environment tourny, and all the rest can be done because sanctioning won't matter.<br>
<br>
Fourth, there will always be "Die-hard" players.  My point?  As long as there are, the will still be games (just the competition will be different).  We will be playing games in coffee houses, our kitchen tables, and in the back of the library.  We won't be afraid of trying new decks for fear of losing a tournament or victory points.  Does this sound like fun to you?  It will be different.  (Note that I am not saying that there will be no more tournys, but they may no longer be the backbone of the playing community.)</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>The Ithorian</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Tue Jan 8 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>why the hell doesnt hasboro and wotc just buy decipher. werent they in a big bidding war for lotr anyway? im sure they got plenty of money. then they could keep the current sw:ccg alive and do anything that they wanted with the sw, st, and lotr licences. seems to me that that would make everyone happy.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:bluca_doop@hotmail.com">TC-M</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Tue Jan 8 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>The PROBLEM with LOTR is it gets OLD quick. <br>

Being somewhat forced to pull out Hoth cards and play under the shield in a sanctioned tourney could be a blast. Too bad scenarios have never really caught on in the player community.<br>
<br>
(2) A Matrix CCG would be really cool, but, alas, it would probably fit best with a quasi-NetRunner mechanic, not a SW:CCG mechanic.<br>
<br>
(3) I agree 99% that LotR will never surpass M:tG.  I also see a finite life for that game, although if Hobbit and Samilirian (sp?) are also made into movies, the franchise could perpetuate 6-10 years, easily.<br>
<br>
(4) I have to laugh when people say that they don't want to see SW:CCG become as cutthroat as M:tG.  Decktech has actually raised the level of worldwide competition, mainly b/c of dissemination of strategies and deck building tips. If anyone ever played at an Open at a major con like Origins, they wouldn't say that SW:CCG wasn't a competitive game.<br>
<br>
(5) I, personally, am a Star Wars fan 1st, then a Decipher supporter.  If WotC's SW:TCG is well-made, uses top-quality images, and comes from a company that learns from its previous mistakes, I'll definitely try it and most definitely collect it.<br>

<br>
If you want me to spell it out: Why not get people mobilized to protest the new licence by WotC? <br>
Insted you tell them "Hey I know you are upset, but this simply isnt going to happen. If Wizards cant get the SW property to work it will just fall off and might even ring the death N(B)ell for the entire industry." To anyone who reads that you are basically saying buy the new game or else no Wars game will ever exisit.<br>
<br>
First of all, the X-Files was cancelled after the first couple of seasons. The fans then protested and we all know what happened after that. Let's see, Vampire (CCG) was canceled, people protested, it's now in print. There are many other examples of times when angry fans of some show, game, product, etc. protested and the item was brought back into production. <br>
<br>
Secondly, when I say you sold out I mean you have more power and influence with this site than anyone I know but chose for some reason to use it to promote the new WotC game. You even said you never have written an editorial before so why start now with a threat of extinction? <br>
<br>
Thirdly, you of all people should be organizing a protest, insted of just throwing your hands up and saying: "If WotC doesn't succede in ruining the game you love with it's dumb knock off we will never play a Wars game again." Or if you don't care enough to protest just remain silent, but don't speak out against it. By doing so you stop the movement before it gets started. <br>
<br>
Finally, it's a load of crock to think that if WotC fails then there will be no card games for Wars. If WotC fails Decipher gets the licence back because Lucas loves his $$ as much as you do.<br>
<br>
So once again I say "Truth hurts doesn't it, Neal".<br>

The official death of Decipher Star Wars CCG has come, may it live on in our hearts and minds. It has been a great 7 year ride of fantastic gameplay and friendships. I trully hope the game is played at larger conventions as the middle Earth card game has remained a playable and exemplary card game. A friend asked me " What caused this " and who or what is the source of evil for this occurance? The answer is not simple. It never is .<br>
  I think the real problem is layable to oh so many feet. First George Lucas and his people need to take a portion of blaim. I first would like to admonish them for not having the insight to in this case NOT grant exclusive rights of a Star Wars Card game to any single company.They could have solved this very simply, Decipher continues its successful game and Wizards gets to try thier hand at it . Different games , unrelated. Lucas Arts is about making money as are all companys, if they felt the Card game licence could be more profitable then why grant exclusivity?The answer is the huge amount of upfront money they can get for the highest bidder/exclusive rights deal. I blaim George and Lucas arts for being about( In the Words of Mel blanks Yogurt...) " Moichandising, Moichandising, Moichandising...Space balls tha lunch box ! Space balls theshaving cream...." Money is nice so is NOT betraying the people who support you. <br>
 Secondly I lay some blaim to decipher,Star Wars CCG is THE ABSOLUTE BEST game ever made in my humble oppinion, however it has always been hard to get new players into the game , partially due to its complexity. Partially due to the severe beatings newbies must endour.Only the upper 3% or so win consistantly. They are rewarded , newbies dont get the rewards. By contrast Wizards saw fit that all participants in Poke league recieved points and EARNED support/prizes. Simpified we are looking at a program that supports winners or a program that makes everyone a winner or at least feel like a winner.I speak from the experiance of taking my 2 older childeren to poke league and many of thier friends (some weeks as many as 8!) I was a certified coach and assistant gym leader for what it is worth. Pokemon was fun, there was strategy there was a randomizing factor that allowed youngsters to win at times against more experianced players.Most of the time a seasoned veteran WILL win.Let me say that I pledge no allegience to Wizards and in fact dislike magic TCG.<br>
 Which brings me to my final point. I blame the players of Star Wars CCG for its death. On the whole I would like to say Star Wars CCG players are some of the nicest people and gamers I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Magic players by contrast are some of the rudest , loudest and most obnoxious gamers I have met ... rude generallizations to be sure, based on my personal experiance.But what DIDENT we do for our game...Well for one , when I started playing in 95, there was an abbundance of players. Kids middle school aged , high School aged , college aged and old timers like myself, played the game. WE abused our player base , dismissed our "Padwan Learners". These player dident stick with the game because they never LEARNED the beauty and complexity of the game. They only learned how to loose. No one can take that for long. I give alot of praise to Deck Teck (David and Neil especially) for information sharing and somewhat leveling the playing field. Sadly it came late and was not enough.<br>
 To Summerize, I blaim us all, George and his Corprate people, Big "D", Wizards"resistance is futile collecitve", And WE the Players. Yes we the players... its alot like America's Constitution opening isent it ... Love it or leave it . I for one love this card game. I will continue to play it when I can , wherever it is played. I will try the New Star Wars Game...because its Star Wars...like I tried all the other Star Wars Games. I am a fan and a collector of Star Wars and have been since the FIRST movie in77. George is after all just a man, fallen and imperfect like all men. Who can blaim George for wanting to make a buck? I like money too. The fault is a collective fault. the blaim is a collective blaim. I think it is time to stop pointing fingers and move on. It is a game, it is ment to be fun, so is "Monopoly" (no pun intended, any simmilarity between George and/ or Wizards of the coast is purely coincidental <img src=/news/smileys/wink.gif> ) . In My mind Star Wars CCG will always be a game and will always be fun. I will miss the tournaments and the friends I have made through this card game. I hope to see you all at NEW Decipher Star Wars ccg tournements, perhaps you will find me at Wizards Star Wars League. God bless you all, in this painful time of change.<br>

Lucas Arts is about making money as are all companys, if they felt the Card game licence could be more profitable then why grant exclusivity?The answer is the huge amount of upfront money they can get for the highest bidder/exclusive rights deal. I blaim George and Lucas arts for being about( In the Words of Mel blanks Yogurt...) " Moichandising, Moichandising, Moichandising...Space balls tha lunch box ! Space balls theshaving cream...." Money is nice so is NOT betraying the people who support you. <br>
 Secondly I lay some blaim to decipher,Star Wars CCG is THE ABSOLUTE BEST game ever made in my humble oppinion, however it has always been hard to get new players into the game , partially due to its complexity. Partially due to the severe beatings newbies must endour.Only the upper 3% or so win consistantly. They are rewarded , newbies dont get the rewards. By contrast Wizards saw fit that all participants in Poke league recieved points and EARNED support/prizes. Simpified we are looking at a program that supports winners or a program that makes everyone a winner or at least feel like a winner.I speak from the experiance of taking my 2 older childeren to poke league and many of thier friends (some weeks as many as 8!) I was a certified coach and assistant gym leader for what it is worth. Pokemon was fun, there was strategy there was a randomizing factor that allowed youngsters to win at times against more experianced players.Most of the time a seasoned veteran WILL win.Let me say that I pledge no allegience to Wizards and in fact dislike magic TCG.<br>
 Which brings me to my final point. I blame the players of Star Wars CCG for its death. On the whole I would like to say Star Wars CCG players are some of the nicest people and gamers I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Magic players by contrast are some of the rudest , loudest and most obnoxious gamers I have met ... rude generallizations to be sure, based on my personal experiance.But what DIDENT we do for our game...Well for one , when I started playing in 95, there was an abbundance of players. Kids middle school aged , high School aged , college aged and old timers like myself, played the game. WE abused our player base , dismissed our "Padwan Learners". These player dident stick with the game because they never LEARNED the beauty and complexity of the game. They only learned how to loose. No one can take that for long. I give alot of praise to Deck Teck (David and Neil especially) for information sharing and somewhat leveling the playing field. Sadly it came late and was not enough.<br>
 To Summerize, I blaim us all, George and his Corprate people, Big "D", Wizards"resistance is futile collecitve", And WE the Players. Yes we the players... its alot like America's Constitution opening isent it ... Love it or leave it . I for one love this card game. I will continue to play it when I can , wherever it is played. I will try the New Star Wars Game...because its Star Wars...like I tried all the other Star Wars Games. I am a fan and a collector of Star Wars and have been since the FIRST movie in77. George is after all just a man, fallen and imperfect like all men. Who can blaim George for wanting to make a buck? I like money too. The fault is a collective fault. the blaim is a collective blaim. I think it is time to stop pointing fingers and move on. It is a game, it is ment to be fun, so is "Monopoly" (no pun intended, any simmilarity between George and/ or Wizards of the coast is purely coincidental <img src=/news/smileys/wink.gif> ) . In My mind Star Wars CCG will always be a game and will always be fun. I will miss the tournaments and the friends I have made through this card game. I hope to see you all at NEW Decipher Star Wars ccg tournements, perhaps you will find me at Wizards Star Wars League. God bless you all, in this painful time of change.<br>

As far as wotc and the new game is concerned: most magic prize support is fronted by the store usually around 75 dollars or a box of the expansion of your choice(within reason). The downside is that it costs around 5 dollars to play but for a grab at 75 dollars every weekend is great! Even though I am pretty much retired I still enjoy the game as it is now and actually I now have more fun knowing that the enviroment is stable and a long way away from changing. We as the players make the game what it is not the people who make it. If the game dies don't blame decipher or wotc blame yourselves. I fully support more fan based events and look forward to the people I have yet to meet. As for LOTR I agree with xavier six that there is much room for current expansions. On the issue of the sites, I believe that the number of the sites will stay the same and that the player will be able in the future to start at the sites of his choice but be required to play the last site of the next expansion. It is sad to see so many people whining when In my opinion the game has only begun to evolve.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:DarkLord484@aol.com">Dark-Lord</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Thu Jan 10 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>I don't think we're exactly Whining.<br>

Also, whenever a "huge change" happens, in the course of anything significant in multi-persons lives/careers, one person ALWAYS stands up and says, "stop whining, only now will it evolve."<br>
<br>
While this is usually true. It can also be no further from the truth. All.... from a certain point of view.<br>
<br>
For example, there will be no cards, so in the obvious way, and the most unobtrusive way, you are wrong, the game will remain the same basically. Because, yes, there will be no more "Decipher" supported this or that. Etc, Etc, Etc.<br>
<br>
Now, for the less obvious route. You are in this way correct.<br>
<br>
From this point and on, {or at least, if in the chance Decipher gets the license... until then}, we make the game for what it is and how it is.<br>
<br>
If we want to make "Player Expansions", we will make, and use if we want, Player Expansions.<br>
<br>
And, so on, and so the story will continue... <br>

Just a few random thoughts for people to discuss/debate:<br><br>
I don't think that Decipher could've offered any amount to Lucasfilm for the license and have recieved it, Lucas has to much money riding in Hasbro (stock), and if he doesn't keep his fellow shareholders happy (and vice-versa), he loses money. In giving WotC the license, he gets a larger cut. <br><br>
I'm glad that WotC supported FreedomCon... but just out of curiosity, didn't FreedomCon occur after Decipher lost the license (not after they announced it, but after they LOST it)? I mean, they're obviously trying to get in the good graces of swccg players (what better way than Decktech or a major tournament to do it), and that's all well and good; but will it continue? Decipher has supported its product from the beginning, and yeah, as of late the support has dwindled, but they have almost <b>always</b> come through. 6-7 years of product support can quickly add up, be it small or large.<br><br>
I don't think most of the players are peeved about the game ending, it was envitable. I think they're upset at it ending so abruptly, and that they're being offered another product (which will or will not prove its value) in its place.<br><br>
To David and Company: Thank you all <b>so</b> much for all the work you've done and continue to do to support this and other games. I honestly think that with you guys around, the game won't "die."<br> I'll still continue to play, but as far as I see it, investing as much money as I have in SWCCG in a product by WotC is too risky. I'll just wait it out, play my game, and someday pass the cards on to my kids. <img src=/news/smileys/smile.gif></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:romasnavandar@yahoo.com">Romas</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Sat Jan 12 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>As I stated in the official forum on starwars.com, the reality of the situation is that the actual money is in the liscense. LucasFilm made money already on the game...so whether or not it fails isn't a loss for them (future profits from expansions can't be counted because they are not definite nor guaranteed to the company. Therefore it'll only be Hasbro that suffers from the poor decision of LucasFilm.) I also have a question: Did anyone ever see any Decipher game advertised on TV? I live near Detroit for most of the year (when I'm not at college) and I've been wondering if I've never seen a commercial for a Decipher game in my area, then have they ever been run anywhere?<br>
<br>
Oh well, I have a terrible feeling that this new game will take off. I've seen Magic commercials and I have no doubt that WOTC will go nuts with advertising for this game. I have a feeling that the phrase "I choose you, Luke!" will be uttered sometime in the near future. Thanks for answering my question about the advertising in advance.<br>
