It beat every army it faced.  <br />
<br />
Units:<br />
The Imperial Sgt raised eyebrows the entire convention and was most definitely the MVP.  Most of the time I was using him to Banzai Charge Grizzled Vets onto unsuspecting tanks.  Those things tore through Crocs, Vet Tigers, Rhinos and KV-1/Cossack Cpts like a hot knife through butter.  Several times I also Banzai Charged the HBH&#39;s and smeared SE paras, Soviet Heroes, Defiant Paratroopers, an Inspiring Hero and Grizzled Vets.  <br />
<br />
Headshot was...well, Headshot.  I don&#39;t remember how many times I used it, but it was instrumental in killing off the aforementioned heavy tanks.  I also hit a 105 and a Churchill AVRE with it and finished them off with Banzai Charged Grizzled Vets.  I even used it on a Humber once since my opponent&#39;s other tanks were the Firefly and Archer so they weren&#39;t a high priority.  <br />
<br />
The BMW proved to be incredibly versatile.  I originally had a Pzf in this army instead of the BMW, but I decided to go with the BMW figuring that I would be using the Grizzled Vets against tanks anyway, and the BMW would work well against the US mortars.  Well, I never got to the US mortars, although I tried, but I did find out the overall usefulness of this piece.  I killed an SS-Haup., a Bofors and another BMW with it, but it&#39;s most valuable asset was harassment.  I could run into a Sherman&#39;s, Stuart&#39;s, or Humber&#39;s hex, stop them from moving and then run away before getting shot at.  If I pulled it off right, I could spawn a Grizzled Vet right under the treads of a light to medium tank and blow it away.  All in all, a great piece for 5 points.  If I ever changed one thing about this army, it would be to add one more bike for an SS-PG, although I would be very loathe to do that for reasons I will discuss next.  <br />
<br />
The mainstay of my army was obviously the 11 elite infantry.  The battles that were most difficult for me were won because I had so many difficult to kill units.  Against a SE para/US mortar army I actually lost more units than I killed and still won because my opponent had only 11 units.  Against a double Croc, AVRE and barbed wire force (that&#39;s right, 10X Barbed Wire) built specifically to beat me, I won on points again after killing one Croc and the AVRE.  The AVRE got Headshot and was never a factor in the final objective showdown, and the flamethrowers managed kills on all my disrupted counter removing def 5 infantry only about half the time.  <br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
Basically I divided my army into two tactical groups, although I tried to keep them as close together as possible.  The Imp Sgt and the BMW would start out as close to the objective as possible while still being in cover.  The BMW would spawn a Grizzled Vet, the Imp Sgt would spawn an HBH, and they would situatate themselves in cover on or next to the objective.  This was a daunting group and did most of the fighting.  I usually held back one Grizzled Vet until late in the game, so I could spawn in in a trouble spot as a big surprise for my opponent.  The Grizzled Vets were outstanding against armor, and they were always a threat to spawn from the BMW.  A couple times I spawned one from the Sniper who was under attack from a Sherman or Stuart, moved in and killed it.  The HBH&#39;s were the spearhead of my army, moving on the objective first while no one was looking and in general frustrating my opponents with their Superior Camouflage ability, especially since the Imperial Sgt was always lurking not too far away.  <br />
<br />
The SS-PGs, SS-Haupsturmfuhrer and Wermacht Expert Sniper were my infantry fire support and usually survived every battle simply because they were lower priority targets and only moved on the objective after the Hero squad had secured it.  I found I could often move this group, including the Sniper, freely even in the open since enemy fire was usually aimed at the Hero squad they had engaged first.  They acted sort of as reserves who came in and threw the battle my way by sheer weight once the Hero squad and Headshot had taken out the main threats.  They easily cleaned up all def 4 infantry and even some def 5 infantry.  They also got in on the action against the double Crocs when my Grizzled Vets went down, attacking with a +2 on their die roll for Ruthless and Banzai Charge.  The SS cpt&#39;s initiative was a big factor the entire tournament.  Against armies with no cpt, I could pretty much plan on having the initiative every turn, which opened up lots of options with the BMW/Grizzled Vet combo as well as a myriad of other things.  After playing in this tournament, I have placed a much higher value on gaining initiative.  <br />
<br />
I played in all four 100 point constructed events with this army, and it went undefeated.  It faced just about every type of tournament army imaginable.  The closest it came to defeat was a turn 8 win on objective control with only 2 SS-PGs, hiney cpt and the Sniper left due to a heavy pounding from a couple US mortars using a parabomb as spotters and a Red Devil Cpt reducing the cover roll.  The last couple days lots of guys were talking about this army as if it was completely unbeatable.  I don&#39;t know about unbeatable, but if played well this army is a significant threat to any build imaginable through set IV.  It is now the 100 point AAM army to beat.  Because of what happened GenCon, that is now an undisputed fact.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
