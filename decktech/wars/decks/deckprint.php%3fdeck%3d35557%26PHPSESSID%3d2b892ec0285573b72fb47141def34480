If there is no real threat to the <b>Brummbar</b>, try to get cheap shots on enemy infantry early and often. If the Brummbar is under threat, keep it tight with your infantry. <br />
<br />
Keep the <b>Wermacht Expert Sniper</b> in cover and behind your lines but still able to cover as many of the objective hexes as possible. If your opponent fields aircraft, send 3 <b>SS-Panzergrenadiers</b> to protect the sniper. SS-Panzergrenadiers en masse are all you'll need for AA fire. <br />
<br />
Slowly and patiently advance toward the objective behind and in cover with an eye toward reducing the number of shots your enemy has on you and protecting your <b>SS-Haupsturmfuhrer</b> and <b>Panzerfaust 30s</b>. When turns six and seven roll around, make sure you have a ton of SS-PGs around the objective.<br />
<br />
If you have done your job the enemy infantry are dead or not able to approach, and the enemy tanks are forced to come in and occupy the objective. With <b>Headshot, Ruthless Close Assaults and Panzerfaust 30s</b>, even heavy armor is vulnerable on the objective. With ten SS-Panzergrenadiers accompanied by an SS-Haupsturmfuhrer and a Brummbar, infantry is dead up to and including masses of Screaming Eagles. <br />
<br />
The Brummbar can kill the <b>Cossack Captain</b> on board a KV-1, leaving the <b>KV-1</b> just as vulnerable to Ruthless Close Assault and Headshot as any other tank. With ten SS-Panzergrenadiers covering the objective and a Panzerfaust or two on the objective hex, even <b>Rhinos</b> and <b>Panthers</b> are not safe.<br />
<br />
The biggest weakness of this army is heavy armor, but it has the capacity to take out one heavy tank because of Headshot and Ruthless Close Assaults. Time Headshot well, and one heavy tank should be no problem. Against two heavy tanks, such as two Crocs, you will probably have to play for a point win, but against any other army you will dominate completely. <br />
<br />
The Perfect Army is designed well for a point win, because of its high number of units that are extremely difficult to kill. The Brummbar has a frontal defense of seven. The ten SS-Panzergrenadiers have a defense of five, and the SS-Haupsturmfuhrer removes disrupted counters from itself as well as from infantry. The Wermacht Expert Sniper can only be attacked at close range and can stop both infantry and armor from getting that close by itself. <br />
<br />
Most of the time, you win by objective control with the overwhelming weight of the SS, but if you are forced to play for a point win, this army and strategy is perfectly suited to do that. That's what makes it <u>The Perfect Army</u>.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
