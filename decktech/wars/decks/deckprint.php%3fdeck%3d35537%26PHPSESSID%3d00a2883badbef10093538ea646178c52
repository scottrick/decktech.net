<br />
They can capture the objective and hold it long enough for the armor support from the Shermans.<br />
<br />
The Hardchargers are tough to kill, can eat up infantry or vehicles, and naturally can land anywhere and ruin the opponents day. The Captain can remain off the board until absolutely necessary and still give you the +3 to initiative and obviously can&#39;t be killed if he isn&#39;t on the table. That can be big in a tight game.<br />
<br />
The Quad 50 is 10 points but is an excellent anti aircraft and anti infantry piece for the money. It is slow so if the objective is in the middle of the table, keep moving in every assault phase and get it in a forest or on a hill and drive the opponent batty with it. I like the Bofors but this squad is All American. :)<br />
<br />
The Shermans are terriffic tanks against both infantry and vehicles. At 21 points each, they are one of the best bargains in the game. I went with 2 of them instead of 1 bigger tank for versatility and mobility.<br />
<br />
This team has it all.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
