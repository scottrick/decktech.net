<br />
The SNLF Fanatics are awesome against infantry. They have hand to hand attack of 12 which will defeat even the hardiest of infantry. They also have close assault against vehicles and they are Hard Chargers which lets them remove disruption counters during the move phase. As if that weren&#39;t enough, they are 5/5 so they are tough to kill.<br />
<br />
What makes them rediculous is the Imperial Sergeants. When he is adjacent to any of your troops, he can command a Banzai Charge letting your Ginsu guys charge into an enemy hex and attack at +1 on all dice. Almost unstoppable unless you get a lucky defensive fire. The Sarge also gives you plus 2 to initiative AND has Hand to hand 10 so don&#39;t think about messing with him up close. He can also Banzai Charge himself!<br />
<br />
The Paratroops aren&#39;t great but they jump on the objective and hold it hopefully long enough for the Ginsu guys to arrive.<br />
<br />
The A6M zero is your anti aircraft and commander killer hopefully and the Ho Ni is a garbage tank with a BIG gun that would be a great trade for a Sherman or even bigger tank.<br />
<br />
The Panzerfausts are an unfortunate substitute until the Japanese get their own anti tank troops. Banzai charging a Panzerfaust against any tank would be deadly.<br />
<br />
The Japanese look weak until they are in action. Very tough! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
