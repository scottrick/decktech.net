<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>New player created tool for SW:CCG ! posted by scott on Wed Aug 2 2006 <br>[sw-ip] The 'Star Wars™: Customizable Card Game™ Information Pool' <br />
<br />
This free offline-tool provides players with a card database including all texts and stats as well as LS/DS counterpart, cards that pull that card, cards that that card pulls, cancellers and much more. <br />
<br />
Find the card you're looking for by setting various filters; find a canceller for an annoying card. Look for underground sites or for characters with the 'thief' characteristic as well as for Maintenance Droids or for TIEs with model type containing 'TIE/ln'. <br />
<br />
Create your Deck by simply adding cards to the included DeckBuilder; store Match Ups, Card Choices as well as your Strategy Section with your Deck. <br />
<br />
Export your Deck in DeckTech-style or as *.csv for Excel spreadsheets. <br />
<br />
Download [sw-ip] and find more information, screenshots and flash-demos at http://www.sw-ip.de. <br />
<br />
Enjoy. <br />
