<br />
Could any other dates stand up to these? <br />
<br />
YES. <br />
<br />
Just one, APRIL 1-2, 2005 - The Yavin IV Regional <br />
<br />
Players from all over the East Coast as well as parts of the mid-west will travel to Renaissance Games (www.ren-games.com) in Fallston, MD to show off their SWCCG skills. <br />
<br />
What’s at stake? <br />
<br />
A $200+ MINIMUM grand prize, byes to the aforementioned world championships, the Ultimate Prize Package from the Player’s Committee......and yes even more prizes SW related but not necessarily to the ccg. <br />
<br />
There will be an early bird tourney at 6 pm on April 1st, the night before the main event. It will be in the style of a local. (4 swiss rounds) $5 entrance fee that will go towards prize support. <br />

6 rounds of normal Swiss play, then we will cut to final four which will be match play. Last one standing after that will be crowned the Yavin IV Regional 2005 SWCCG Champion! <br />

At the end of the 6 rounds, a classic event will start up for those not in the final four. Ample prize support will also be provided for this event, so have those decks ready! <br />
<br />
In case you missed it, prize support will be INSANE, including but certainly not limited to: <br />
