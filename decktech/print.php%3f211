<hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>Faramir a companion.  He's more of an ally in the book.  Eowyn makes sense to be a companion, sort of.<hr>Jared Stein said on Thu Jul 4 2002 <br>It doesn't sound like either really need to be errataed, though I would like to know what ring bound means...<hr>Darryll Silva said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>now I will be forever reminded of michael dalton following me around as a companion during games<hr>Wes Simpson said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Here's to an Arwen and Eowyn starting fellowship!<hr>Gordon Alanko said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>My guess is that "ring-bound" is a keyword for events etc., much as "Ranger" is. I also think that it will depend on who stayed with Frodo and the ring. <br>
(Sam, Gollum, Faramir) as compared to those who didn't. (Aragorn, Legolas)<hr>Ryan French said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>wonder what "Valiant" means then.  i bet you're right about Ring-bound, Gordon...sounds very cool.  I've been wondering how the "Fellowship" is going to be handled since the "Fellowship" was really only a unit in the first book.<hr>Adam Drake said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>Since the fellowship splits, I think there will be a new way to play: without the ring bearer. What that would mean is that if you are playing without a ringbearer, you can only play certain characters (valiant?) and if you are playing with a ring nearer you can only play with those that are "ring bound." Just a hypothesis...<hr>Gordon Alanko said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>My guess on "Valient" is a keyword like "Ranger" as well, but you could be right, Adam. I personally think the fellowship will probably stay togther, based on interviews from D's site, but that "ring-bound" and "unbound" companions will be able to help you in quite different ways.<hr>Nathan Magro said on Fri Jul 5 2002 <br>My guess is Valiant is a keyword that could mean they are permanently defender +1<hr>David Sidhu said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>I think the fellowship will be split into the ppl destroying the ring, fighting wars etc.  hence the keyword Ring Bound.  Will be interesting to see how the big battles get played out in the skirmish phase and if there are any new rules for that.<hr>Eric Splittgerber said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>So Rohan is a seperate culture, darn i was hoping for a kind of "rider" non-unique that will work in a gondor deck. will there be a way to combine Rohan and Gondor like there is a way to combine Nazgul and Sauron? or will Rohan just be some culture to balence out the ROTEL Isengard fleet. Im hoping for both.<br>
-eric<hr>Skyler Cuthill said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>Isengard fleet? Your just mad because your precious Nazgul got about 3 new cards and my new deck wiped the floor with your Greenleaf<hr>Eric Splittgerber said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>shut up skyler, just remember the time i trashed you with my sauron burden deck ok<hr>Jassem Sleiman said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>I agree with Adam about the fellowship. that's been something of an idea i've had myself, i'm glad i'm not the only one thinking that a possibility. but one thing i love about decipher is that they always do something cool. but not to get off of the subject but, dude, Eric, I can't believe you actually think that ROTEL made isengard an unstopable force. the set is not as good as it was hyped up to be. but atleast you get one of every ring in each box. ;) ehhh?!<br>
-----<hr>Sean Smith said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>I am still waiting to find out how they do the sites.  Are there going to be still nine or will each new book add nine so the fellowship splits after a certain site?<hr>Third Angel said on Sat Jul 6 2002 <br>are these as fake as the first frodo's pipe spoiler? cuase that one was bad. and how do you know the truth to these cards till they are printed anyways, they go through so many changes till they finally decide on the card. (Then they even change them afterwards! like 'we must go warily' which was a major pain. so bad that they have to errata all my favorite cards)<hr>geoff Smith said on Sun Jul 7 2002 <br>I heard a rumour that Valiant means that you cannot be overwhelmed.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Sun Jul 7 2002 <br>I heard a rumour that Valiant is just another keyword.<hr>Gordon Alanko said on Sun Jul 7 2002 <br>Your rumor sounds good to me, Wes. Most of the others I've heard would just require errata "We Must Go Warily" style.<hr>Doug Faust said on Mon Jul 8 2002 <br>I overheard one of the designers say that the text on these cards wasn't finalized, so they could change before TTT...<hr>Enrique Huerta said on Mon Jul 8 2002 <br>That is what I heard too... the posters were up only to generate buzz. The stats and gametext were still under review.<br>

Shadow 16<hr>edmund gray said on Mon Jul 8 2002 <br>Few things:<br><br>Valiant does mean a character cannot be overwhelmed.<br><br>Ring Bound is justa  key word.<br><br>They both have a new signet: I believe it's Boromir's father (Theodin?).<br><br>Eowyn is hot.<br><br>These cards are not finalized, especially their images.<hr>jason wade said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>the way it was explained to me, valiant was they cannot be captured. I don't know if that is true or not but that sounds good to me and I think it is a good guess.....they my introudce capturing into lotr. I mean capturing in starwars was not introduced in the first set. so different things may be new idea and game play ideas that are going to be introduced.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>Umm, Capturing? Not quite. Edmund is correct, it means cannot be overwhelmed, but as he said, these are cards still in progress.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>Boromir's father is Denethor, the Lord of Gondor.<br>
<br>
Theoden is the Lord of Rohan, and Eowyn's father.<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>Actually, Eowyn's father is Eomund. Theoden is her uncle.<hr>Steve Kuperman said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>Thought I'd point out a couple of things that people have missed. First, Eowyn's card is purple, so presumably this is the chosen template for Rohan. Also, while Eowyn is a new signet, Faramir is Aragorn signet. And as if it needed more reinforcement, Ring-bound is just a keyword, ala Ranger or Twilight.<hr>Wallt Wallman said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>Ok.  I think I like whats going to happen.  But I really want to know what "ring-bound" and "valiant" mean!  I don't think we will be able to play with out a ring bearer, however right now there isn't a rule that says you cant split the fellowship.  SO........If anyone has more info or any ideas..cantact me!<hr>Julien Vazquez said on Tue Jul 9 2002 <br>i was told by a decipher volunteer that for the two towers, ull have brand new sites 1 to 9 and ull have to play with those sites only, no mixing whatsoever. so ull have Fellowship of the Ring Environment and The Two Towers Environment.<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>That is correct, there will be different formats for each movie, with their own site paths.  Valiant just means a character can't be overwhelmed.  Ring-bound is a characteristic, and refers to those who had contact with Frodo. Unbound companions are those without the Ring-bound characteristic.  Thus, the fellowship won't be split, but some companions will be affected by Ring-bound cards, and others will not. (at least as far as I can tell at this point).<hr>Justin Alderman said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>I think its kinda funny that Eowyn is considered a Man, but her gametext seems pretty cool since it might keep an important companion alive. Faramir is also interesting because of the no skirmish actions. It'll be just power vs. power, unless you play a pumper. <br> As for the new keywords, I'll just wait and find out what they mean when the set comes out, no point in guessing. As long as Gollum is in the next set I'll be happy.<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Wed Jul 10 2002 <br>Gollum won't be in the next set. D can't release his image until after the movie comes out, so he'll be in the 2nd expansion for TTT.<hr>Eric Splittgerber said on Thu Jul 11 2002 <br>what are they going to do about the FOTR cards, in terms of ringboundness? if ringbound does mean those who came in contact with frodo, or even stay with him, how  is D going to work it out with the Fellowship cards, are they just going to say "well, er, sam:proper poet is ,er, ring bound." ?????<hr>Mickey Wright said on Thu Jul 11 2002 <br>Eric, ring-bound and un-bound probably reffer only to after the breaking of the fellowship.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Fri Jul 12 2002 <br>The images are up for both of these cards.<br>
<br>
Faramir has the Frodo signet, not the Aragorn signet. Eowyn has the Theoden signet.<hr>Eric Splittgerber said on Mon Jul 15 2002 <br>that may be, but what if you wanted to use the proper poet in a deck after TTT? im sure the new sam's are going to be ring-bound.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Mon Jul 15 2002 <br>Just because Poet isn't Ring-bound doesn't mean he's not going to be good anymore. There will be certain FP cards that reward you for playing Ring-bound characters. Keep in mind also that there will be devastating Shadow cards that hurt players using Ring-bound peeps...<hr>Thomas Jefferies said on Thu Jul 18 2002 <br>Perhaps Ring-bound is a keyword to non-ringbearer corruption, like when Boromir went after the Ring.  So in the the case of the number before ringbound, (guessing) If you can spot 7 or more burdens on the ring bearer this companion is discarded.  This may be the limiting factor on his superb ability.  <br>
