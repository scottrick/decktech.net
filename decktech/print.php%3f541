<h2>www.decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>2006 is here! Win Free Gifts from CardAgora AND add a new DT feature. posted by DeckTech on Mon Jan 16 2006 <br><img src='/avatar/decktechlogo.jpg' align='right'> 2006 is DeckTech's 7th year in business, and it promises to be an exciting one.  With an overabundance of people, content, discussion and fun, there really is only one thing missing: <b>Money</b> ;-)<br />
<br />
Therefore, we are going to spend the next month or so raising some much needed fundage, and to start things off with a bang, we proudly present the <b>New Year's Avatar Give Away</b>!<br />
<br />
When you purchase a normal 6 month <a href='http://www.decktech.net/premium'>premium membership</a> anytime between <b>now and Feb 28</b>, you will be immediately entered into a drawing, to be given away on said Feb 28, that gives away one $15 gift certificate from <a href='http://www.cardagora/com'>CardAgora </a> for each 4 members that sign up!  Yup, one of every four members are getting their money back courtesy of our friends at CardAgora.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and just as exciting, with the 20th member that signs up in the requisite time, we at DeckTech will be programming a much requested Avatar feature for the buzzboards(the first of which is pictured to the right).  Like all DT features, it gives you freedom that you rarely find on other websites. Upload and change your avatars for all to select, whenever you want.  This is something people have wanted for a long time, so make your mark on DeckTech and help be a part of its creation!<br />
<br />
Finally, I'll extend a special offer for those that just really want to make a donation to help out their favorite website - if you sign up for 3 account memberships, I'll just take you out of the drawing and give you a $15 Gift Certificate to CardAgora. No drawing, no waiting for 4 other people, it is yours.<br />
<br />
There you have it; Free Gift Certificates & New Features, and best of all, you help DT and the other members of our fine community ensure DT for their children.  Go sign up and get in on the fun!<br />
<br />
Thanks to: <a href='http://www.cardagora.com'>CardAgora</a>  for helping out as always<br />
