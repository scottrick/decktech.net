<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Hayes Hunter DPC Champ Speaks Out posted by Mike Girard on Wed Sep 5 2001 <br>Hi, I'm Michael Girard, Vice President of Player Relations for Decktech, Inc.,  and I am interviewing Hayes Hunter, recent winner of the Denver DPC. Hayes Hunter is currently ranked 2210 (before DPC Denver is updated).  He has been living in Massachusetts for most of his life and just recently moved to Arizona, to attend University of Arizona in Tucson.  And now on to the questions. <br>
<br>
- How/When did you learn to play SWCCG? <br>
<br>
Hayes - I've always been a "card" person.  I've collected sports cards, X-Men cards, then Magic and so on.  Sometime just before the release of Dagobah my Dad and I went on a vacation and in buying supplies for the trip and such I came upon the Premeire 2 Player Beginner set.  My first game took over 3 hours with him (we hadn't figured out attrition) but something drew me to it.  I don't know if it was the Star Wars appeal or the game itself, but when I came back from that vacation I was determined to play the game. <br>
<br>
- What has been your greatest achievement in SWCCG, what about Non-SWCCG? <br>
<br>
Hayes - As far as SWCCG goes, it was a great feat for me to qualify for the '98 Worlds when I was only 13.  I really sucked then, and my poor preformance at the worlds really motivated me to strive to be the best.  Either that or this interview.  I mean, damn, you're Mike Girard!  How cool is that?!  Non-SWCCG, hmm... I guess it'd have to be the time I rescued a mother and her two infant children from a burning building and then went back for the dog and gerbils.  Probably. <br>
<br>
- What made you decide to go to DPC Denver, how was your trip? <br>
<br>
Hayes - Several factors helped me decide about going to Denver.  For one, I had just recieved my last two pay checks from work, so I had $250.00 to burn.  The plane ticket was less than $200.00 so I knew I would be able to break even at the very least.  Colorado is also home to two very important Star Wars players to me: my good friend Kyle Craft, and the #1 rated player in the world, Brian Hunter.  Who wouldn't want to take an opportunity to visit a good friend or test your skills against the best in the world?  So I went and had a blast.  Look for my TR on DeckTech.net soon! <br>
<br>
- What decks did you play at DPC Denver?  What factors made you decide on these decks? <br>
<br>
Hayes - Light was easy.  I've seen the light (no pun intended).  Bottomly has shown me the way, and so it was "WYS SOLID" for light.  The deck just doesn't lose.  Period.  If a deck doesn't lose, why not play it?  Dark wasn't as simple.  I really didn't want my deck to rely on Mob Points, so in talking with Bastian Winkelhaus, Julien Riviere, and Alex Tennet, among others, I had narrowed the field down to three: the new Watto objective, AOBS, and HDADTJ SOLID.  Many thanks go to Enrique Huerta and Justin Beal for the hours of discussion and playtesting, but the ultimate decision of what to play came from Jon Dunn.  He basically told me what I wanted to hear, assuring me that going with the deck I was most comfortable with, the deck that I had the most experience with and had the most confidence in, was the way to go.  And so I brought with me my long time favorite, "HDADTJ SOLID." <br>
<br>
- What was it like playing against Brian Hunter, and what is your opinion of his play ability? <br>
<br>
Hayes - Ever since Hunter joined DeckTech, and as long as I've known Kyle I've been getting a feel for his play style.  Through his TRs and decklists, and especially from what Kyle has told me of their 20+ games, I have really established a greater understanding of what makes the guy tick and, as such, what I can do to take him apart.  I've been preparing to play him for some time, you could say.  The week prior to the event I just tried not thinking about playing him.  Even 5 minutes before our game I forced myself not to think about playing him.  I know that alot of what makes Hunter "Hunter, the #1 ranked player in the world" is psychological; I have the same effect on people, to some extent. <br>
<br>
I just sat down to that first game, and played.  I knew I was playing Hunter, but I didn't let it phase me.  I just focused on the game.  At first it was really intense and exciting.  Both of our hands were shaking, but after the game started swinging my way I was able to calm down.  I just kept focused and started making random conversation with Hunter and who ever was watching to keep things light. <br>
<br>
The next two games were far less nerve racking.  Because I was seeded higher I chose to repeat our last game first in order to make him have to catch up to my differential to win.  The last game I had an incredible start, allowing me to activate 19 force on my second turn!  There was no way I was going to lose, so it there was literally no pressure on me.  After the final Scott Gaeta, Hunter's local TD, told me he had never witnessed Hunter lose so convincingly once, much less three times. <br>
<br>
Like anyone in the top 5 or 10 in the world (including myself but not Chu) I feel he's over rated.  He is an extremely solid player, easily one of the best in the world, but his style is very defensive.  If you're able to get around the entity that is "Hunter" and just play him as a person, he is beatable, as I have shown. <br>
<br>
- What do you have planned in the future, tournaments wise? <br>
<br>
Hayes - Well this weekend I'll be playing in the Phoenix DPC at EdgeCon on Friday, then I'll be helping run a couple events the next two days.  It should be a really cool weekend with some of the best players from the United States flying in to participate.  After that I don't have anything big planned until Worlds. <br>
<br>
- And what advice can you give to a player that is aspiring to be a better SWCCG gamer? <br>
<br>
Hayes - Two points of advice, both painfully simple, and yet extremely effective. <br>
<br>
One: Play.  Play as much as you can.  Try to play at least every day.  Like anything else in the world, if you want to get good you need to practice.  I owe my entire success in Star Wars to my brother, Eric, for just being there to provide me with an exceptional opponent whenever. <br>
<br>
Two: Shuffle.  It's really that simple.  Shuffling is wonderful.  It's relaxing, it unclumps your deck, it makes your opponent wait for you, it gives you good draws (or at least it does for me), so shuffle. <br>
<br>
That's all for now! I'm Mike Girard and I'll see you at DPC Phoenix this Friday!
