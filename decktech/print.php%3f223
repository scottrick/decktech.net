<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed Jul 31 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Hmm, is this some kinda last ditch effort? ;)<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>so unless something strange happens - Brian Hunter needs to invest in a trip to GenCon and BAM...he wins. How cool to have 3 broken vaders :)<hr>Scott Lingrell said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>nice to know our Vaders (Chu's and mine) went to a good cause...<hr>Michael Girard said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>what vaders?  what are you two babbling about?<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>There is a promo card of vader that is hands down the most broken card in the game...word is that like 7 exist (they went to the guys who went to WOTC to playtest) Hunter has 3 of them...and i guess no one else who actually plays the game has any.<hr>Peter Jacobson said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Go for it!   SW:TCG Rocks!  I love WOTC!  They Rule!  I have a BINGO!  <hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>LOL, Brian Hunter = Yahtzee Champ. It's all about broken cards that no one else has ;)<hr>Brian Hunter said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Vader isn't really that broken anymore, now that their 1st expansion set has come out.  The addition of Maul gives dark side more alternatives for "character" selection, and the addition of Mace Windu means the light side is not as reliant on the "Anakin" persona anymore.  Vader is still good, but not just completely "broken" like he was for DPC Houston.  <hr>Raphael Asselin said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>I have a "Broken Vader to SELL" Anyone interested..<br>
<br>
<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Jul 31 2002 <br>Hmmm. Now I kinda regret not being able to make that playtest, I coulda sold that Vader for some decent cash... [mumbles something obscene about the Army always screwing up plans] <hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Aug 1 2002 <br>It's kind of annoying to try to take away from Brian's possible win by calling the game "yatzee" or saying it's cause he has vaders.  Give the guy props he deserves.  Go read some of the strategy articles if you think the game is tripe, cause it's not.<br>
<br>
These prizes are fat, some of you are just trying to put it down for subjective reasons.<hr>Scott Manley said on Thu Aug 1 2002 <br>Well lets see...I payed $45.00 to get into Origins last month then payed another $10.00 just to play in a WOTC SWTCG tournament...and I did not even get a booster pack.....thanks for nothing Wizards.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Thu Aug 1 2002 <br>it was my understanding that "yahtzee" and the reference to vader being broken as hell was what hunter made reference to.<br><br>i see they are giving everyone a vader when they show up now...the last thing i would do is take away from his possible win. the guy has dominated SWCCG for years - he obviously knows how to play cards.<br><br>and dammit - i don't want to put WOTC down for throwing huge prizes at their new game...Decipher did shyte with SWCCG for years (i wouldn't wish that on people who play the new game). Sidenote: considering i didn't even know a second expansion existed...don't take my word on anything.<hr>Scott Manley said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Listen Even.<br>
You must be new to CCG.<br>
Cause any real players would know that Decipher has given away prize support over the years to SWCCG.<br>
Like "FREE" booster packs.T-Shirts and Foils.Just for playing in a tournament.<br>
I have news for you...SWTCG will not last as long as even poke-mon.<hr>jason baretta said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>does anyone know how SWTCG is performing sales wise? is it tanking or is it doing ok? all i know is that it hasn't taken off like a super nova the way Pokemon did, and that was the way WOTC were plugging it.<br>
Those prizes would indicate it must be doing some good for em.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>The irony of some scrub no one ever heard of saying evan is not a "real player".<hr>Andrew Howard said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Uhh, Jason, SWCCG has been outselling SWTCG since its release, does that tell you anything? :) And since when is Evan a real player? :P<hr>Scott Manley said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Hey Neal...<br>
I can give you the names of people who have never herd of Neal Razi...does that make you a scrub?<br>
SWTCG has been doing real well in my area...so has Hero Clicks.<br>
But at Origins last month, There were 8 players at the SWTCG table I was at...and 68 players at the SWCCG table.<br>
Not bad for a dead game played by a bunch of "unheard of" scrubs.<hr>David Jones said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Of course no one as made a herd of Neal Razi...takes too long and we only need one, and the list of people who have *heard* of Neal Razi I'm sure is a lot more vs. how many people have heard of Scott Manley, now after you gain another 400+ SWCCG rating points till you match Neal's rating then you might be able to call him a scrub...maybe.<hr>Scott Manley said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>First of all David...<br>
I did not call anybody a scrub.<br>
I leave that up to the kids on decktech.<br>
I was pointing out that he called me a scrub cause nobody had ever heard of me.<br>
Then you called me a scrub cause of my rating.<br>
Well rather than point out how meaningless the rating system is...<br>
I will say that people who have heard of me will tell you that I am a scrub for many other reasons.<br>
The only point I had started to make was in defense of Decipher.<br>
They have done a lot for SWCCG and its players.<br>
Where would Decktech be today without SWCCG?<br>
l dont really care what you think about me.<br>
But lets show a little respect for what Decipher has done.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>(ignoring the comment about me being new...)<br><br>wb premier, cloud city, and foils all suck...but they don't match up to what SWTCG is throwing out. After losing the license this year - we will see the biggest signle prize for winning SWCCG ever. my point is decipher is too little too late to get in the serious running for a prize-oriented game.<br><br>As far as giving respect for decipher? I will in one regard - thinking up this wonderful game. After that they fell short of expectations. should i list? (EPP, missed due dates, prizes, ratings meaning something, broken cards, destiny 6 mains, lying about the license, cancelling dcon, running major tournament at a gravely pace...) I like most of the people i met at Decipher and respect them completely. however, decipher decided a long time ago not to try and build a game with a serious competitor in mind. that was a bad decision IMO.<hr>jason baretta said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>EPPs are cool!<br>
<br>
but wow, SWCCG is out selling swtcg, that does say something. maybe the boycott that no-one said would work is working. or maybe its just a really ordinary game and no-one would be bothered with it anyway.<br>
gotta say though I'm excited about the rumours of WoTC and D being in negocitations about the possible leasing of SWCCG's game mechanics. I mean new classic SwCCG expansions, or even a new game with classic SW mechanics backed by Wotc ace Tournement support would eb a match mad in heaven (professional swccg player any1?).<br>
but they are just rumours...<hr>Seth Van Winkle said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>What I don't get is why they thought the game would sell.  One game based on a lisence might do well if the lisence is strong (which Wars is.)  2 is too many, 3 is way too many and 4 is just stupid.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sun Aug 4 2002 <br>Not sure where you hear these rumors jason, but I find it really <b>extremely</b> unlikely, WOTC had the option to buy the mechanics when they got the license, they chose not to because they wanted to make their own game, doubt they would change their minds(and frankly I hope they don't, they F*** up enough games, don't want them doing the same to one I like).<hr>Assunta Androssi said on Mon Aug 5 2002 <br>wonder who Brian's gonna take wit him to australia?
