“Vader’s Custom Tie” should read “TIE”.  The other card is a very rare unpublished card:<br />
<br />

Deploy on Vader if at Cloud City:  Dining Room. <br />
May deploy Vader’s Cape from reserve deck; reshuffle.<br />
If Leia here, draw destiny.  <br />
Add 3 if Ceremonial Necklace here.  <br />
Leia crosses to Dark Side if destiny > 6.<br />

[response to reviews:<br />
<br />
Iron Joe:  Yes, QMC aliens is pretty much unwinnable.  But I HAVE beaten Australian Nationals winning WYS with this deck, so I disagree that WYS should ‘dominate’ the matchup.  I agree that Mist Hunter (v) is good, but Red 5 (v) – which is often played in WYS – cancels its text, which makes it Mist Hunter (v) a floating piece of junk.  In addition, Evacuation Control (v) hurts multiple destiny drawing generally and I think the TIE cannons are the way to go for winning space battles.  However, you can take out Guri and ship for MH (v) and Zuckuss if you like.<br />
<br />
Master Chief:  I did have Open Fire! in there originally but took it out for Sniper since I wanted to be able o use it in space as well – it would be well worth putting it back in though.<br />
<br />
End response to reviews]<br />
<br />
I have had good success with this deck in informal games and playtesting, and its great fun!  There is nothing in here which is overly techy, so there’s nothing to keep secret for future tournaments.  I figured I’d post it since DT has been quiet for a while.<br />
<br />
I typed it up from memory – its pretty close to what I’ve been using but I might have got something wrong.<br />
<br />
First, the activation is good for the first turn, but you give away a lot as well and get no more.  If you are likely to come up against choke decks then put this deck back on the shelf.  The current meta seems to be less choke, so this is ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
Space<br />
<br />
Against most decks the first priority is to secure the system.  Has not been a problem so far.  Combat Response gets the ships out fast.  Space card choices:<br />
<br />
Vader (v) and Custom Tie:  Vader is key for holding the system, subtracting 3 from a destiny and 3 twice if with Black 2 (v).<br />
<br />
Black 2 (v):  stops All Wings Report In.  Big big big.<br />
<br />
Saber 4:  Deploys as a react with a pilot for FREE to a system with a Saber ship.  Wow.  One game I had Black 2 (v) and pilot at a system and HCF battled and I reacted with Vader (v) in Saber 4 and I lost nothing and then beat him down next turn.<br />
<br />
Guri:  if you are worried about a destiny-adding frenzy with HCF and Life Debt or whatever.  Just make sure Vader is not there.<br />
<br />
Dreadnaughts:  Saber TIEs can’t move, so something has to carry them around … adds one to power for Tallon Roll and general power pumping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ground<br />
<br />
After you have space locked down then secure the ground.  One AAT with a Tank Commander aboard and a gun at the Battle Plains, with a couple of ships at Naboo will give you 12 power, 13 forfeit and two battle destinies AND the option of shooting (lost), all for total cost of 6 force, where the gun goes back to your deck (with Inconsequential Losses (v)) and the droid to the racks.  Cool.<br />
<br />
You can use the droid guns for forfeit fodder and tracked 6s.  Take them out if you don’t like them.  Defensive Fire (v) is used against Jedi or X-wing cannons.  You shoot first, for free, adding 3 to the draw on the ground (or 5 in space with your cannons) and they go lost.  3B3-888 (who can be safe aboard a tank) subtracts 3 from defense value of Jedi (do this before the battle starts), so they should be hit most times.  Blaster Deflection can’t save them.  They die.  Then you can shoot again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Admiral’s Orders<br />
<br />
This deck plays SIX Admiral’s Orders.  I originally put these in for fun, but they turned out to be really good.  You just pick the one you need at the time.<br />
<br />
Fighter’s Coming In:  Immunity in space, minus power for LS ships with no pilots.  Use if the system is in contention.  Also the best picture on any card ever.  Can be got by Turr Phennir.<br />
<br />
Battle Deployment:  Gets Tanks (good).  Opponent draws one battle destiny on ground (huge).  Use if ground is in contention.<br />
<br />
We’re In Attack Position Now:  direct damage for the Tank Commanders.  Use in a damage race.<br />
<br />
Best of all, you can cycle the AOs back into your deck by replacing them.  Tracking made easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s about it.  It’s a really fun deck to play with – lots of interaction!  Activation is the biggest weakness, but its not fatal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Matchups (I will add others if requested):<br />
<br />
HB, MBO:  Sandwhirl tech is no problem.  Pump out your space and use the appropriate AO for the situation.  Corvettes would be trouble but Search & Destroy and Security Precautions are not too difficult to add if you are worried – just take out the two Droid guns – they are kind of cheesy anyway.<br />
<br />
EBO, Speeders:  attack their ground with Tanks.  You should own the ground.  Your space is strong enough to compete.<br />
<br />
Jedi:  Take the system, then Battle Deployment is good.  Jedi die like lemmings.  You lose droids to racks and weapons to deck.  Quick Draw (v) means they will SOMETIMES hit your tanks (they need to draw 10 to hit the AATs and 11 to hit the AAT leader), but they will run out of Jedi before you run out of tanks.<br />
<br />
WYS:  You should win.  Their puny ground cannot compete with your tanks.<br />
<br />
Obi-start decks:  First turn Tank with 2 Battle Destinies on Obi is really really bad for Obi.  Really bad.<br />
<br />
QMC aliens:  toughest matchup by far.  You need to get the damage going fast.  Deploy straight to Bespin and try to get rid of Dash.  I would expect to lose this one.<br />
