This deck was nearly my LS deck for over two years and served me well in my tourneys here in Germany: It’s record is 15–3 (with 6–0 at the Europeans 2003 & 2004 where the best players on this side of the Atlantic met) and it made me Ralltiir (the German Opens) Champion 2004 and 2nd place 2003 & 2005 with 9–0. It lost two times against a Walker deck (with –1 and –3 Force) and (long ago) against the old Tatooine-Docking Bays-AT-STs-Winkelhaus-style deck in local tourneys.<br />
The average victory was with +17 Life Force remaining. So much for the statistic.<br />
<br />
Play:<br />
To tell you what the strength of this deck is let me give you a short tourney report what can happen in turn 1 (actually this report is a mix from two different games, it’s just combined here to make a good story even better…):<br />
Dark Side plays Black Sun Agents, downloads a lot during his turn, therefore giving me 4 Force (plus one for my Objective) and invades the Throne Room with The Emperor (v) and Bane Malar (v). My opening hand consists only of red cards, damn. But wait! There are 2 Tunnel Visions among them, great! So during the Dark Side turn I take Obi-Wan’s Journal into hand via Rycar Ryjerd (v) and pay 3 Force for the Wokling (v) to take Secure Route (v) into hand, leaving me with 2 Force. On my turn I activate 9 Force to a total of 11 and play my first Tunnel Vision: In the Force Pile are Panaka, Sabe, We Don’t Have Time For This and useless stuff. I take Panaka into hand, deploy Wise Advice Shield, deploy Secure Route, deploy Panaka for free, get Tunnel Vision back, play 2 Tunnel Visions to get Sabe and We Don’t… and deploy Sabe for 2 Force (6 Force remaining). Then I send Sabe out of play to deploy Padme from Reserve Deck. Padme pulls Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight for 5 Force, who loads his Stick and a Lightsaber Proficiency from Reserve. Adding his Journal, Uber-Obi is ready for killing. I play Don’t Do That Again Shield to pull Advantage. With the last Force I initiate a battle: Instead of playing We Don’t… as my first action I trust my destinies in Reserve and my interrupts in hand and swing Obi’s Stick at The Emperor: Destiny 4 and Destiny 1 (Quiggy), argh, but I play Jedi Levitation (v) for a redraw and it’s Destiny 3, adding 1 for Obi’s Stick against a Dark Jedi to a total of 8 – hit! Before the opponent can do anything I lose 1 Force to play Sorry About The Mess and The Emperor goes in Lost Pile. (If my opponent would have fired a weapon I can cancel the weapon destiny with the Journal – but that doesn’t work with the Emperor...) Then I play We Don’t… and draw 3 Battle Destinies: 5, 1, 6. My opponent draws a 4. My total power is 28 (never forget the +3 Power from the Proficiency) while his is 8 (+2 from Jabba’s Influence (v)). I forfeit Panaka, play Advantage on Obi (opponent loses 2 Force during his move phases), Bane forfeits for 8 (+2 from Desilijic Tattoo (v) and +2 from Ket Maliss (v)) and my opponent loses 12 cards, I flip my Objective, feel like young Luke after blowing the Death Star and I’m happy!!! And all happened in Turn 1…<br />
<br />
Ok, we all know this little scenario won’t happen all the time but I think you get the point where the strengths of this deck lie.<br />
This deck is meant to play DEFENSIVELY: Wait for the opponent to come to you or spread out and drain like mad if he sticks to his own game plan. After a very quick objective flip the opponent loses 4 Force from the objective and 5 Force from drains at two sites: You secure the Throne Room with Amidala and Uber-Obi and the Hallway with Panaka and Qui-Gon with his stick. Usually your opponent gets nervous with losing 9 cards per turn and only 4 characters guarding two sites and attacks. For this you have enough characters or powerful interrupts to clear the sites once and for all – remember after flipping to cancel all battle destinies greater than 3, so the damage on your site will be predictable. Also you can have Jerus Jannick at Amidala’s site, Houjix and It’s A Trap! for safety reasons. When the opponent attacks it is most likely Quiggys Site. See to it that Quiggy stays so next turn you can move Obi to him with Jedi Leap for a major beatdown (remember, you can cancel two weapon destinies now with the Journal).<br />
In a drain race it’s a good option to deploy some characters to the opponent’s site. But beware: When you do this in midgame you have to avoid getting a beatdown yourself. It’s safer to deploy in late game when the opponent lost all the powerful battle interrupts to force drains…<br />
Remember to have ALWAYS at least 2 Force activated (3 Force is better) to cancel opponent’s battle destinies – nothing is more frustrating than seeing the dark side drawing a 6 and a 7 for battle destiny and having no Force activated to cancel them. <br />
<br />
Specific card choices:<br />
<br />
Padme instead of using only Queen Amidalas – she pulls Obi and/or Quiggy two times per game which is important in the early game. After that feel free to overdeploy her with the Queen so that all Republic characters are save and secure…<br />
<br />
Sio Bibble not only adds 2 to Force activation and subtracts one from Force drains at adjacent sites, he also gives all Republic characters present power +1 making him in fact a power 5-7 character when attacking with other guys.<br />
<br />
Caldera Righim is one of the best aliens ever because you don’t have to be afraid of beatdowns at his location which is very helpful.The opponent needs ability lesser 8 to initiate a battle and that is normally a maximum of 3 (small) characters. By the way his game text doesn’t count for you so feel free to attack with lots of Jedis. He can also block a force drain where opponent has ability 8 or more and need not be afraid of getting his nice fur blood-red.<br />
<br />
Projection Of A Skywalker can help you in two ways: Either adding to your force drain in a drain race on the Hologameboard or limiting opponent’s force drain –1 on a planet site.<br />
<br />
Obi-Wan’s Cape is the last piece for Uber-Obi: His defense value is +1, he may not be excluded from battle and can cancel another weapon destiny after using the Journal or maybe cancel a duel oder lightsaber combat destiny.<br />
<br />
No space? – Trust me, some versions of this deck had ships in it either to hold a system and therefore not paying to Battle Order or to use the Landing Claw on a Capital. It was useless nearly all the time, the opponent battled with weapons or enough power to take every ship down or canceled the Claw. Also it’s not easy to deploy ships with matching pilots abroad when you not play Squadron Assignments. After all the card slots were just wasted with space instead of concentrating on the ground where the power of this deck lies.<br />
<br />
No Jedi Council Chamber? – When you are set up and have only a few chacters left to deploy it is impossible for you to hold the chamber if the opponents invades with strong cards. It would be stupid to lose a drain race because you gave the opponent the site to win the game, right?<br />
<br />
No Mantellian Savrip? – It’s easy to pull with 3 Escape Pods (v) in the deck I know, but the biggest problem is: This deck wins most of the battles because of the canceled battle destinies. And when I lose a battle on Naboo I prefer to forfeit a Panaka from table rather than from hand because I get a card from lost pile back into hand for deploying him again with Secure Route…<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
vs. Walker: The hardest matchup by far. It’s a drain race which you will probably lose when Imperial Decree (v) is on table, limiting the force loss from your objective. But remember that Obi’s Lightsaber bonus cannot be canceled with the old Imperial Decree because of the Journal. The same counts for Quiggy as long as he is at the same site as the Journal. The best way to slow your opponent down is to attack him when he spreads for Walker Garrison - either by deploying or moving characters via Nabrum Leids. But watch out for Ice Storm, hold your Control in hand or deploy not to the outermost marker. And use one of your three Senses to cancel Walker Garrison if it comes to play or Recoil In Fear to send his hand to used pile after he grabs the epic event to keep the generators alive long enough.<br />
<br />
vs. SYCFA Fear: Another drain race if the opponent plays without the new Kuat Drive Yards (v) to raise the Force loss with Fear Will Keep Them In Line (v) to 8-10 Force per turn. Use your only Alter wisely to cancel Fear, getting it back from Reserve Deck with Yoda, from Force Pile with Tunnel Vision or from Lost Pile with Secure Route to play it (hopefully) again and again and avoid Fear-damage.<br />
<br />
vs. Senate: Start with Scrambled Transmission (v) instead of Rycar Ryjerd (v). Cancel the political effects which cancel force drains or add to battle destinies, at best when senators are on them.<br />
<br />
vs. LSC: Not a problem anymore because you can lose 1 Force to cause a combat card to be lost with Civil Disorder (v) or cancel one with Obi’s Cape.<br />
<br />
vs. most other decks: Play defensively as mentioned above. Win the game. Smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rumors have it that V9 may show cards to make this deck even more powerful: You might see some real masters with a lightsaber… wait and see!<br />
<br />
To come to an end, excuse my bad English, spelling mistakes etc. as this is my first deck on DeckTech and my school English is long, long gone…<br />
