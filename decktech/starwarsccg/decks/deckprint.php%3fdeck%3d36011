This section is pretty long, I was going to make it an article, and I guess I probably should have.<br />
<br />
The Light Side Meta has been heavily focused on Mains and Toys because the only really good characters for Light are the Jedi. When we were trying to think of good strategies vs. these decks, Lewis&#39; Monkey TIES popped into my head. <br />
<br />
http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/decks/decks.php?deck=9532<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a link to the old deck, from 2000. <br />
<br />
Lewis called it Monkey Ties because a Monkey Could play it, it&#39;s that easy.<br />
<br />
So Ties seemed good to me, and I decided to go to work on it.<br />
<br />
I really wanted to try and use blizzard 4 at a desert on Wakeelmui, pull Kuat first turn for the +2 generation and go from there, but it really wasn&#39;t working for me. I could do it off the subjugated planet start, but then I&#39;d have no scomp link for Merrijk, meaning I&#39;d have to play Kuat Drive Yards (v). And if I went with an Imperial Occupation start  I would only be activating 3 on my own my first turn. It jumps to 8 on my turn 2, but when you have to pull systems turn one for 2 force, it&#39;s not that advantageous.<br />
<br />
So I went back to Lewis&#39; SYC start to try it out a bit, I ran some games with Steve Baroni and some games on gEngine to test it out. It gives a ton of searches, and provides them a drain of 2 mid to late game when they want to come kill Merrijk and start draining. It also takes more cards to make work and just wasn&#39;t that fluid.<br />
<br />
I had a couple people trying to come up with platforms for me, and H2O had mentioned Endor Ops in passing. All night the night before regionals I kept waking up, stressing about what to do. I woke up early and did some searching and looked at the Endor Ops and decided on it for a few reasons. Starting the Bunker means that in some matchups I can start Imperial Decree and Pull Endor Shield turn 1 to stop their activation at Endor. The main reason, was that I realized I could play Ominous Rumours, which had hosed me in one matchup the week before at Ohio States.<br />
<br />
Before we get into strategy, this deck pulls a ton of cards turn 1. Against anything starting Obi Wan on table, you really don&#39;t want to give them any drops. 1 at the most, so play shrewdly. You have to get Wakeelmui and SFS, but you could wait on systems.<br />
<br />
So for strategy. Start Endor Shield (v) for two reasons - Pull Merrijk, Force Choke the opponent. Start Xfire (v) to pull Sienar Fleet Systems. Start Mob Points to pull Wakeelmui.<br />
<br />
First action - Pull Wakeelmui. Second Actoin - lose a card from hand (any card, you&#39;ll be retrieving it in a second) to take SFS into hand. Third action, if you don&#39;t have a system in your hand, pull Merrijk. <br />
<br />
Next, activate the forces. Control Phase - pull Ominous Rumours. Deploy Merrijk and grab a system. Depending on how much force the opponent gives you, you can pull Kashyyyk first turn, or if it is a matchup where you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll see Kessel, deploy Kessel to make your first ship -1, leaving you an extra force to pay to retrieve whatever card you lost to activate Crossfire (v)&#39;s gametext.<br />
<br />
So after tun 1, you should be giving them just 2 icons while having 7 on your own, which is a nice little ratio. Merrijk should be at the bunker, you should have a TIE at your non endor system and you should have Ominous on table (if you could have afforded it) to make that turn 2 drain +2.<br />
<br />
After that the deck is just a little engine. Crank out systems, drop a vanguard to each system (if you have a TIE Squadron you can deploy any TIEs down and just save force to deploy as a react). You want to make sure you can back up your ties with either a GHHK or a react, but you also have Crossfire to sac for a destiny, which is like a ghhhk.<br />
<br />
For Ground, I just use bliz 4 and stick it at the Dbay. It&#39;s near impossible to beat blizzard 4 down unless they mech failure it. Yeah it doesn&#39;t have immunity, and it&#39;s easy to take out, but every card they contribute to taking it out is one less card you have to drain them for, AND there&#39;s so much retrieval in this deck that you get your Bliz 4 back anyway. Another reason for Bliz 4 is that against an Obi-start deck, you can go down with it early, blow crossfire and take out Obi wan. Truth is, you activate so much force late game, that you can still pay for 3-4 drains and still have enough forces left to save for a react or deploy retrieve.<br />
<br />
Asteroid sector is in there to cancel drains at a big system you can&#39;t take over (you can battle with this deck, but you really don&#39;t need to) to cancel the drain, and to cycle your TIES late game for more retreival. Deploy the squadron there, retreive 3, kill it to used pile, repeat.<br />
<br />
Dreaded Imperial Starfleet cancelling drains is sooo goood.<br />
<br />
Monnok is in there just because you give them so many drops turn 1, that if they have 12 cards, you could play masterful, giving them another card and pull a monnok and shoot their hand back to 8. I&#39;m not a big monnok guy, and it could definitely come out, but it was in there on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Ability Ability Ability is mainly for senate I guess, but hyperwave scan might be better. Truth Be told, I try not to put too many cards on table, so Ability isn&#39;t that tough to cancel against anything but a mains deck. <br />
<br />
The TIE package is pretty solid. 17 with 2 dreadnaughts is a lot but you really don&#39;t want to be drawing extra cards in this deck, plus each TIe is a retrieval too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Late game, you just want to get them down to a little force, and then deploy as much of the ties in your hand as you can to retrieve as much as you can.<br />
<br />
This deck went 2-1 at Kashyyyk regionals. It raped speeders by 29 and beat Hyperdrive by 26. It lost to Xwings played by Matt Sokol by between 17-22 I don&#39;t remember what. But Xwings are an awful matchup. Xwings can move, TIES cant. but it was frimbazeling hilarious that we played an Xwings vs. Ties matchup in 2007.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other questions hit me up, I feel like I&#39;ve forgotten something but there&#39;s so much here I think you&#39;ve read enough if you even got to this point. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
