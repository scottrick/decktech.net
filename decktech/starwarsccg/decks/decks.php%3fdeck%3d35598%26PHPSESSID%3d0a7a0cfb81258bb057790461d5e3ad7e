<br /><br />
The deck that Brian Rippetoe used to win the Tenessee DPC Tournament, and to qualify for Worlds.<br />
Since the redux was up in the air, I knew this deck wouldn&#39;t have lived to see WC 2006.<br />
So I gave him the deck, to be tried in a last tournament.<br />
He used also my DS deck, but the DS wasn&#39;t cheesy at all.<br />
Brian cruised to take 1st place at the tournament, where a lot of cheesy decks were played.<br />
I&#39;m quite proud, I must admit, that Mynock Circus took the win.<br />
<br /><br />
The deck idea burst into my mind as soon as i saw V11.<br />
Even thought the deck is not quite dead yet (WYS(V) hasn&#39;t been reduxed yet, only the back door effects), it will be soon.<br />
It is however very weird, since it uses some of the most crappy cards ever made in the SWCCG universe. To name a few: Mynocks, Echo Base Trooper Backpack, Blaster (Premiere), Y4 Trooper<br />
Some of those cards are so horrible (Mynock) that the PC didn&#39;t even looked at the rules problems surrounding them, even thought asked repeatedly to do so.<br />
<br /><br />
Now, usually, people just read the strategy and then the decklist.<br />
Change this: look at the decklist, just one time. Now get back to reading the deck&#39;s explanation<br />
<br /><br />
 <br />
<b><u>II. How does it work ?</b></u><br />
<br /><br />
Basically it&#39;s a two card combo: <b><i>This Place Is Getting Rough (V)</b></i> (flip side of objective) and <b><i>Disarming Creature (V)</b></i>.<br />
All in all, one of the most easy combo to pull off, since the Shield can be pulled anytime you want, and for the flip side, well, you just have to flip. And trust me, this is done very easily.<br />
Here is the text of the important cards:<br />
<b><i>This Place Is Getting Rough (V)</b></i><br />
<i>(...)You may activate and retrieve 1 Force whenever you win a battle or fire a non-repeating weapon.(...)</i><br />
<b><i>Disarming Creature (V)</b></i><br />
<i>(...)During an attack (except at a pit), your characters at that site may fire character weapons at participating creatures.</i><br />
<br /><br />
So, you get it, the goal is to shoot at your own creatures (since you can&#39;t rely on the opponent playing them) to activate (not bad) and retrieve (very good) some force.<br />
<br /><br />
Now, of course, shooting and hitting your creatures would be pointless. Sure, you would retrieve a force, but you would lose one: your creature. So we will be missing our shots.<br />
This retrieval works very nicely because attacks (and thus, shooting) happen very often:<br />
- LS battle phase: you have always the option to initiate an attack against one of your creature. So your characters could shoot at ONE creature, thus retrieving force. This option is rarely used, because it&#39;s not effective as the other following ones. (mainly because you can attack only one creature, secondly because it&#39;s costly - 1 force - and lastly because you might end up killing the poor beast with sheer power anyway)<br />
- LS battle phase: your creatures (unless playing this awful Worrt) attack. I mean, poor beasts, they&#39;re hungry. They always attack randomly, but you can always decide which side they will attack, so be nice, let them feed on your characters. These attacks are FREE (woohoo!), and especially happen for every creature on the site. So it works great with selective creatures (multiple attacks all in one phase).<br />
- DS battle phase: same as before. Your creatures are really spoiled brats, and are hungry again. The only problem is actually the fact that the Dark player can actually deploy some people to your creatures&#39; site to TRY to kill them BEFORE they attack. I say "try" not because killing a creature is that difficult, but because of the rules, they won&#39;t be able to attack more than one. Heh. Pity there will be always AT LEAST 2 of them there, and that you can redeploy one without any problem (at all) during your next turn.<br />
<br /><br />
Anyway, back to the main problem: you have, of course, to MISS your creatures. This way, you&#39;re not losing cards. Just retrieving them.<br />
This is more easily said than done, since the number of LS creatures from which to choose are limited, to say the least:<br />
- <b>Worrt</b>: at first hand, he seems great. Deploy 2 (0 with Tauntaun Bones (V)), pullable with Tauntaun Bones (V), defense 4, he seems the perfect candidate for the job. However, let me tell you, he is horrible. First of all, he does not attack your characters, so no abuse possible. You would be limited to your own attack initiation during your turn (and firing during DS turn if the opponent has someone here too). Then, you can have only one. He must have seen some highlander movie, I guess.<br />
- <b>Space Slug</b>: hello, what are you thinking here ? Disarming Creature (V) does not work in space. Then, no space weapon can target the Slug either (weird I know, I guess the Slug is part of a Committee of Rare Animal Protection or something). Forget it. Since these 2 beasts were the only ones pullable with Tauntaun Bones (V), well, put the effect into your binder again. It&#39;s useless.<br />
- <b>Nudj</b>: ah, a selective creature. Great very great. Also deploys for 1. Cheap! It chokes also the opponent, which is even more great. Did I say, however, that it has a defense of 1 ? Now, do you really think you&#39;re going to miss it with a weapon shot ? No of course not. Well, you wouldn&#39;t believe it, but I actually worked very hard on that creature myself, despites its shortcomings. The Nudj had also the great advantage to be able to prevent your opponent from messing up with them (no spy no party). Still, dear Nudj, you&#39;re not up to the job. Sorry, you&#39;re fired.<br />
- <b>Scurrier</b>: again a selective creature. The cost is slightly higher: 2. Then, the defense is also slightly higher: 2. Trust me, the number of destiny 2 cards are few. It doesn&#39;t change much from having all destiny 1 in the deck. It&#39;s still horrible. Especially since the creature is destiny 5, which is not so good when you draw it for weapon destiny <br />
- <b>Vine Snake</b>: still a selective creature. Deploy 2 again, however, Houston, we have a problem. This beast attacks once and then stays attached to the victim. Gone are your dream of repeating attacks, unless you play every turn Blaster Vermins ! but you would be too vulnerable to a grabber or Sense. But at least the defense value is better: a nice 3. So you can have cards with destiny up to 3! Woot!<br />
Hey, are you listening ? I said to forget about these vile reptiles!<br />
- <b>Mynock</b>: here we are the last option left open. The good: defense value 3. Selective creatures. They do not attach to your characters. The bad, the ugly: deploy cost 3. Now, of course, you could play Flash Of Insight (non-V) and track one to deploy it for free. Now, this is ridiculous: to do it, you need anyway to pay 3 force, and last but not least, to find and deploy Flash Of Insight. So drop the matter. And keep the Mynocks: that&#39;s the only thing you have left.<br />
So go collect some of those Mynocks: half of your Circus is ready now you just need an artist, and you&#39;re ready to go.<br />
Artist ? Yes, a Mynock Trainer if you prefer.<br />
Mynock Trainer ? Someone who will shoot them without hitting them, for God&#39;s sake!<br />
You know, like the blind knife thrower with the girl on the wooden panel ? That&#39;s it.<br />
<br /><br />
Now, to be able to miss with a deck full of destiny 3 (or less), you can&#39;t rely on lightsabers, of course (unless you have no more reserve deck, but hey, you have to recirculate sooner or later, so it doesn&#39;t work that much, trust me) and EPPs, well, usually all (but Chewie EPP) fire at +1, so, they&#39;re no good (and then, they cost usually a lot, +3, to deploy). So you have to take more ehm primitive weapons (no, drop those Ewok Spear, please. Not THAT primitive!)<br />
Of course, also, cost of deploy, but mostly, of fire, is an issue. While you will activate 1 force for each shot, this 1 force will usually be paid for Secret Plans for your retrieval, so any force required to fire is, let&#39;s admit it, a pain (there are multiple reasons for it, but we&#39;ll speak about it later). <br />
Now, what are the perfect requisites of our weapons ?<br />
- Destiny 3. Not more. You wouldn&#39;t want to draw them for weapon destiny, trust me.<br />
- no such thing as "destiny +1, +2, or +3" to hit. Here, we look for something simple. Very straightforward. No unnecessary killing. Since "destiny -X" does not exist vs. creatures, a simple "destiny > defense value" will do. Remember, we have to miss defense value = 3.<br />
- fire cost: free.<br />
- deploy cost: free if possible, could be 1 at most (since they are deployed only once, while the firing happens continuously).<br />
- non-repeating weapon. Else, the flip text of WYS (V) does not work.<br />
Well, alas, such weapons do not exist. Sorry.<br />
Game over ?<br />
Nahhhhh...<br />
You will find out that there is a nice little device, the <b><i>Mercernary Armor</b></i>, which says:<br />
<i>Use 2 Force (free on Leia) to deploy on a Rebel without armor. Character gains spy skill, power +3, armor = 4, and immunity to attrition < 3. Imperial Barrier is cancelled. Blasters deploy for free and fire for free on this character.</i><br />
<br /><br />
Now, this means that there is now, one weapon, that suits all requirements. IF the character using it is also wearing the armor: <b><i>Blaster Rifle</b></i>. Destiny 3, from Premiere. The most ancient blaster in the world is the one that I use to fire. So now you fire and deploy for free your blasters on the warrior (rebel without armor too). But you can fire only one. Unless... unless you play with another Card: <b><i>Echo Trooper Backpack</b></i>:<br />
<i>Deploy on any trooper. May carry and use any number of weapons and devices. Trooper is immune to attrition < 3 when at a planet site.</i><br />
Ok, so you need these 2 devices. And now, your "rebel warrior without armor" needs also to be a trooper.<br />
Well, there are not that many. In the beginning I thought about using Madine to get the Endor Scout Trooper, but then, it turned out that you need at least 3 or 4 in your deck to be sure to have one in your reserve during your deploy phase. So I opted for General Solo (V), and started him with the WYS (V) objective. Solo (V) pulls ANY turn a non-interrupt card with door in title, and the <b><i>Yavin 4 Trooper</b></i> fits all the requirement needed.<br />
Yes, Y4 Trooper. He&#39;s your Rambo, your Trainer.. He&#39;s the last piece of puzzle to complete your beloved Circus. Mynocks rejoice! You&#39;ll live to see the day!<br />
<br /><br />
To pull the 2 devices, there&#39;s <b><i>Rycar Ryjerd (V)</b></i> starting, and even <b><i>BoShek (V)</b></i> (pullable with your objective).<br />
So now, you have your trooper on a site (the jungle, the Y4 trooper can&#39;t deploy elsewhere), and usually, very soon enough, creatures (Mynocks) on his site (pullable with the Swamp game text, or deployed directly from your hand). The trooper will have some weapons, let&#39;s say 2-3, and will shoot at Mynocks (let&#39;s say 2-3 too). If you want to protect the trooper some more, put Undercover (V) on him (pullable with Rycar Ryjerd (V) or Wokling (V) starting).<br />
<br /><br />
Now, there&#39;s nothing better than an example to let you understand the full brokenness of this deck.<br />
<br /><br />
<b><u>III. Example</b></u><br />
<br /><br />
Here is what happens in a usual turn, with just half the weapons (3 out of 6) and half the creatures (3 out of 5) at the Y4 trooper&#39;s site (usually the swamp):<br />
<u>LS turn: </u><br />
deploy phase: if they are less than 3 creatures there, deploy one from your hand or the swamp&#39;s text. (3 force)<br />
battle phase: you CAN initiate an attack (1 force). Usually you don&#39;t have to. (If you do, your trooper will shoot 3 times at a Mynock, activating 3 force, retrieving 3 force, and putting 3 destiny in used pile.)<br />
Then, all 3 Mynocks attack. One at a time. The Trooper shoots everytime. 3 shots per creature.<br />
Total force activated: 9<br />
Total force retrieved: 9<br />
<u>DS turn:</u><br />
battle phase: the opponent manages to kill one Mynock (not more, mind, rules forbid it!!!).<br />
now it&#39;s the Mynocks&#39; turn to attack, and they attack, again, your side of the table (you can decide it). Now, of course, the Mynocks could attack someone different than your trooper, since it&#39;s random, if you have other characters at the site. Pity that the Disarming Creature (V) shield doesn&#39;t care who is attacked, only that you have characters with weapons at the same site. Hey, you could even make the Mynocks attack your opponent&#39;s characters there, and it would still work (you can shoot all the same). <br />
Total force activated: 6<br />
Total force retrieved: 6<br />
Of course, the first force retrieved will be the Mynock just lost, which will be, then, at the bottom (nearly) of your Reserve, once recycled. Which allows you to redeploy it via Swamp&#39;s game text (or track it and take it into hand with the flip side of your objective).<br />
<u>GRAND Total for a FULL Turn:</u><br />
Force Activated: 15 to 18 (3 to 4 used, up to 18 to 22 if Secret Plans on table, but consider you have a full turn of activation too)<br />
Force Retrieved: 15 to 18<br />
<br /><br />
That&#39;s a lot.<br />
Too much, really, for any turn, but this was to prove a point: you don&#39;t need 3 creatures and 3 blasters. Even less will do. <br />
Now, of course, you will empty up your reserve quite quickly (activate 1, draw 1 weapon destiny, each time). However, having NO reserve does NOT prevent you from firing weapons. Before jumping to the wrong conclusions, read the rules. <br />
The main problem, without reserve left, is that MAYBE (not sure), rules could prevent you from using WYS(V) flip side, since it says "may activate and retrieve 1 force", and since you can&#39;t activate, you may not be able to retrieve either. This is why one of the tech cards in the deck is Descent Into The Card. It should be only used during your turn, when you need to retrieve force badly. Then, you will retrieve so much during opponent&#39;s turn, that it won&#39;t be needed anymore.<br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
<b><u>IV. Problems... and solutions</b></u><br />
<br /><br />
Now, of course, a trooper, even undercover, is still, well, a trooper. Sure, he has a lot of late-technology gadgets. Still, he might, let&#39;s say, ehm.. suffer from a painful demise. <br />
How ?<br />
<b>Hutt Smooch:</b> capture your trooper.<br />
Counters: Grab and Sense (x4). No pity. The decks playing Hutt Smooch are few. Usually Scum decks, who took some hit during the last V set. Also, they don&#39;t have THAT many Hutt Smooch, and considering that the card is cancelled by I Don&#39;t Need Their Scum Either (V), you won&#39;t see it very often. If all fails, drop EPP Luke there, kill the guy, and free your trooper. Or just continue deploying blaster to your other corellians and continue shooting the Mynocks. All in all, won&#39;t happen often.<br />
<b>Trample:</b> ugh. Splish!!!<br />
Counters: Grab that. And Sense it. The good point: the opponent who plays Trample is NEVER playing Hutt Smooch. Trample, however, is way worse. If it comes to that, be sure to have some other weapons in hand. Your Mercenary Armor, Undercover (V) and Echo Trooper Backpack will go to the Used Pile (read Rycar Ryjerd (V)), but your weapons won&#39;t. <br />
<b>Sniper:</b> wow. This is easy. <br />
Counters: You can sense it too. Or simply use one of your backdoor effects to neutralize it. Remember that your trooper, being a rebel, has defense value 6 (armor=4 +2). Heh, nearly a Jedi. Sniper is unique too. Counting Undercover (V), he is even worse than a Jedi as for defense value.<br />
<b>Creatures:</b> scrunch, miam, slurp.<br />
Counters: well, here it&#39;s tricky. Before speaking about creatures, let me say first that NO-ONE should be playing them anymore, since the anti-creature shield. So it is a near non-issue.<br />
If some crazy guy (like me) is playing it, well, of course Bubo will eat for breakfast your trooper, since the Dark Side player will surely play Krayt Dragon Bones (V). What to do ? Well, play an EPP to the same site as your trooper. And pray. The opponent will maybe come and try to hit your EPP. You have to prevent him in any way possible (back door effects come to mind), so that you can hit the creatures with your Lightsaber and kill them before they munch on your trooper. Note that the more characters you have at the site, the more your trooper will be safe from "randomly being picked up for breakfast". There&#39;s a good point, however, in this whole story. You will retrieve force by shooting while the opponent tries to eat you alive. All in all, it&#39;s not so grim, but it could be better, of course.<br />
Last counter: play Disarming Creature nonV in your deck. That will be enough.<br />
<b>Other anti-spy cards:</b> uh ?! errr. <br />
Counters: Sense ? but especially: no one plays them.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b><u>V. Card by Card analysis:</b></u><br />
<br /><br />
Start (10)<br />
Watch Your Step (V)<br />
An Unusual Amount Of Fear OR Thrown Back (V)<br />
<i>--> Thrown Back allows for a quicker start, but you will give a lot of pulls too to the opponent. It allows however to play the 4th effect. Your choice.</i><br />
Corellia<br />
Millenium Falcon<br />
<i>--> well, basically it gives you immunity since turn 1, which can be key. </i><br />
- General Solo (V) <br />
<i>--> pulls the Y4 Trooper, all the Back Door effects and the Back Door location, everyturn. Allows you to pull also Punch It! when the opponent wants to fight you. Solid.</i><br />
- Leebo (V)<br />
<i>--> well, the droid does not add anymore 1 destiny to attrition, unless you want to add Dash Rendar to the deck, but still, he does what he does best: lose 1 to top deck the topmost card of opponent&#39;s reserve. Combined with your unlimited retrieval, the opponent will lose force much more quickly.</i><br />
HFTMF (SI)<br />
Rycar Ryjerd (V) <br />
<i>--> pulls Demotion (V), very important vs. Sim Aloo (V). If the opponent does not play it, you can pull Undercover (V) and your 2 Devices. (only 2 pulls however)</i><br />
Wokling (V)<br />
<i>--> +1 force generation. Key at the start of the game. Pulls Undercover (V) or Demotion (V). last minute retrieval.</i><br />
Strike Planning<br />
<i>--> pulls Mon Mothma (V), key to pull Aquaris, since Emperor&#39;s Power (V) will surely be played on Corellia turn 1.  With Wokling (V), it allows you to activate at least 3 turn 1, even against the worst DS choke deck, allowing to deploy her and Aquaris, and move the ship there.</i><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Locations (5)<br />
Aquaris<br />
<i>--> +3 activation there from turn 2, since you will move your ship there.</i><br />
Jungle<br />
<i>--> 1st site to pull, a must have, since the Y4 trooper can only deploy there.</i><br />
Swamp<br />
<i>--> 2nd site to pull. Deploys your creatures. +3 to battle.</i><br />
Desert<br />
<i>--> last site to pull. Emergency tire if the opponent Elis to your other site before you flip. Adds your drain potential, as you will see later.</i><br />
Endor: Back Door<br />
<i>--> quick and efficient way to play all your Back Door effects. Boost your activation (it never hurts).</i><br />
<br /><br />
 <br />
Characters (10)<br />
Mon Mothma (V)<br />
<i>--> beside pulling Aquaris, she will be quick ability 4 character on table, key to play early Sense. Prevents Tatooine Maul too, who can unflip you.</i><br />
General Carlissian <br />
<i>--> pullable with Strike Planning, deploys for 2 on Falcon. Adds 1 to maneuver, but especially prevents the opponent from playing his own Lando (V), which is the worst card you might see.</i><br />
Yavin 4 Trooper <br />
EPP Luke (x2)<br />
<i>--> he&#39;s no jedi so you can drain vs. Combat. He&#39;s no Obi either, so there&#39;s few that can harm him. Still, he&#39;s an EPP and he costs 5. Pilot too. He can swing at your creatures for free for more retrieval if you have no more reserve deck.</i><br />
BoShek (V) <br />
<i>--> another ability 4 pilot. Pullable with the flip side of your objective TPIGR(V). Can pull your devices.</i><br />
Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader<br />
Palejo Reshad <br />
Romas Lock Navender <br />
Corran Horn <br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
Ships (8)<br />
Bright Hope (V) x2<br />
Tantive IV (V) x2<br />
Spiral<br />
Corellian Corvette x2<br />
Gold Leader In Gold 1 (V)<br />
<i>--> all ships follow the following logic: Capitals, so that you can shuttle from the system to the site to flip (happens often), and most are cheap (good for flipping when your other ship is at Aquaris) or Corvette (react at Corellia). GliG1(V) is the exception, but he can land, and he costs 2 also, with a passenger/pilot slot.</i><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Creatures (5)<br />
Mynock x5<br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
Weapons (6)<br />
Blaster x6<br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
Devices (2)<br />
Echo Trooper Backpack<br />
Mercenary Armor<br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
Interrupts (7)<br />
Sense x4<br />
<i>--> 4 ? You need them. Protecting your trooper is key. Pack a 5th one if you don&#39;t want to play Disarming Creature or Descent Into the Dark.</i><br />
Punch It!<br />
<i>--> only destiny 4 in the deck. Not a problem.</i><br />
<br /><br />
 <br />
Effects (5)<br />
Undercover (V)<br />
<i>--> subtracts 1 from each opponent&#39;s EPP weapon destiny at same planet, 2 if targeting the UC spy. You fear even less Sniper (against an EPP strike, your trooper is defense value = 10!!!)</i><br />
Count Me In! (V) (x2)<br />
I Wonder Who They Found (V)<br />
That&#39;s One (V) (x2)<br />
<i>--> see Back Door effect strategy. It&#39;s quite different and interesting.</i><br />
Demotion<br />
<i>--> against Sim Aloo (V) mostly. Works nice vs. Bewil (V), General Veers (V) and other nasty imps out there.</i><br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
Admiral Order (1)<br />
No Question Asked (V)<br />
<i>--> should be out turn 1. Boost some more your activation, helps in space and for drains on Corellia&#39;s sites. The opponent will have wished to have put Emperor&#39;s Power (V) to Aquaris.</i><br />

<b><u>VI. How to play the deck</b></u><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Start of the Game.<br />
Turn 1 Dark Side.</b><br />
I&#39;m considering the opponent is not playing a deck screaming "Sim Aloo (V)". If he is, pulls ASAP Demotion (V) and all the cards you can. If you can&#39;t, because the opponent is playing Forced Landing (V), well, then you will have to pull and deploy Demotion (V) later.<br />
Pull, during their end of turn, the Jungle, and Back Door. Pull also Mon Mothma (V).<br />
<b>Turn1 Light Side.</b> (activation 3+X if Emperor&#39;s Power (V) is on table or 5+X)<br />
Pull NQA (V), and IWWTF (V) with Solo (V). Pull also General Carlissian. Activate and drain for 1.<br />
Deploy Mothma (V) to the Falcon, pull Aquaris with her. Deploy the Back Door. Play IWWTF (V) on it (draw 2 cards). Deploy NQA (V). If you have 3 force left, deploy Carlissian too as a pilot (Leebo (V) becomes a passenger). Then move Falcon to Aquaris.<br />
<b>Turn 2 Dark Side.</b><br />
pull Count Me In! (V) if the opponent will drain, else pull That&#39;s One! (V). Pull the swamp.<br />
<b>Turn 2 Light Side.</b> (activation 9+X to 11+X)<br />
Pull immediately the last back door effect (or the trooper if you have them all). Pull the Desert.<br />
Drain if possible.<br />
Now you can flip usually. That&#39;s One (V) has to be deployed, giving you two more force activated.<br />
Deploy 2 corellians to your sites (deploy all 3 of them) or to Corellia (to a capital just deployed there), to then shuttle them down. If you&#39;re using the shuttle down strategy, remember to first deploy people on your ship before deploying the sites (preventing any anti-flip barrier strategy).<br />
Flip.<br />
When you&#39;ve flipped, the sites should be like this: Desert-Jungle-Swamp.<br />
Make sure one of your character is at the Swamp, and the other at the Desert. Leave them alone.<br />
Don&#39;t deploy Count Me In (V) if you don&#39;t have 2 force to retrieve.<br />
Start pumping your force pile with the Threepio&#39;s side of your objective, and pulling a Corellian, every turn.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Now, what will happen (besides you taking the trooper into hand)?<br />
The opponent will surely try to fight you down. He will pay +3 to deploy. Then will go surely to the Desert. If he can&#39;t deploy anything else, depending on the force he has left, you might wish to use That&#39;s One (V) to lose 2 to cancel a battle. <br />
He has to stay there. He might, but then, he&#39;ll risk a Sanwhirl. If he moves, fair enough.<br />
Your next turn, you&#39;ll activate a lot. You&#39;ll drain for 1 at Aquaris, 1 at Corellia, and 2 at each controlled Corellia&#39;s site. If he moved away, no biggie: drain for 6. If he didn&#39;t, lose That&#39;s One (V) to relocate your character to the jungle and drain for 2. 6 cards go away. <br />
Deploy Count Me In (V). retrieve 2.<br />
Deploy your trooper, the armor, the backpack, some blasters and some creatures. Start shooting, activating and retrieving. Of course, everything can be done at the Jungle (if you deploy your creatures from hand) or at the Swamp (then, you have to move the trooper there). Remember that you can however move the trooper quickly with That&#39;s One (V), if you wish it so. <br />
During the opponent&#39;s turn, pull your retrieved Back Door effect (if there was one) into hand.<br />
And retrieve of course. The opponent won&#39;t have any choice but to go to the site of your trooper+creatures to kill them.<br />
Continue draining all the while, make him lose force with Leebo (V) every turn.<br />
Play Ultimatum shield if things get too ugly.<br />
And abuse the Back Door effects.<br />
How ?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b><u>VII. The Back Door effect strategy.</b></u><br />
Besides giving you the usual advantages, these effects shine in this deck.<br />
Why ?<br />
Let&#39;s read them again.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b>I Wonder Who They Found (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on Han or Back Door; draw two cards from Reserve Deck. Your Rebels are defense value +2 and are immune to attrition < 4. Imperials deploy +1 here. May place Effect in Lost Pile to cancel the targeting of a character weapon.</i><br />
Obvious things: you draw 2 more cards at the beginning of the game, so your odds of pulling a needed card (like a missing ship or corellian) increase.<br />
Adds 2 to Defense Value of your rebs. EPP Luke becomes defense value 7, but the trooper especially goes up to 6 (armor+2) and to 10 really vs. EPP swings.<br />
This effect protects your trooper from Sniper strikes. Then during opponent&#39;s battle phase, you will retrieve this back door effect, to be able to pull it during your next turn again. Unlimited weapon protection, it&#39;s called. In battles too, of course, when they are during your opponent&#39;s turn.<br />
However, you can also cancel your own weapon targeting (which doesn&#39;t cancel the firing, mind, so you&#39;ll still retrieve and activate a force). Why would you do that ? Maybe you need a tracked 1 for Sabotage (V) ? Maybe it&#39;s the end game and you want some more differential ? <br />
You can always use it during your turn, vs. one of your blaster fires, to activate one more force than normal (you won&#39;t draw weapon destiny, so it means you won&#39;t empty your reserve, and the next firing will again activate the next card from your reserve, and not "firing it").<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b>That&#39;s One (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on Chewie or Back Door; activate two Force. Your battle destiny draws are +1. Once per game, may lose 2 Force to cancel a battle just initiated. May place Effect in Lost Pile to relocate your character to an unoccupied site related to that character.</i><br />
Activate 2 more, very useful in the first turns, to be able to do everything you wanted. All your BD, which are usually "3", become "4". In WYS (V) flip, this effect shines, since you can flip without fear (but Alter, but hey, you have 5 Sense) of getting beaten down. And you can use this effect for more spreading during opponent&#39;s turn. If for example the opponent deploys to some other place, and has no force, realistically, to deploy and beat you on corellia&#39;s sites, just lose the effect to relocate to an empty site for more drains. Retrieve the effect during opponent&#39;s battle phase, rinse, repeat. Since you have 2 That&#39;s One (V) in your deck, you&#39;ll have always this card deployed, during both turns.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Count Me In (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on Leia or Back Door; retrieve 2 Force. Attrition against opponent is +1. When opponent draws battle destiny at a non-Naboo site, unless they have total ability > 3 there, cancel the destiny draw(s). May place Effect in Lost Pile to cancel a character weapon destiny.</i><br />
Now, even a 3 will become a 4, then a 5 attrition, enough to break most immunity. It will prevent Dr Evazan combo (corellian ?) to draw a BD alone at your sites too.<br />
Like IWWTF(V), this card can be use to cancel your own weapon fire. Nice since you might be unlucky and draw a 4 or 5. Also, if you cancel your own weapon destiny during opponent&#39;s turn, and you fire again after, you will retrieve back Count Me In (V), which can be deployed again next turn for another free 2 retrieval (another retrieval loop). Protects, again, vs. Sniper. <br />
Can be lost on purpose to retrieve it and track a 5, which can be useful for shooting an opponent&#39;s main, or anything else.<br />
Like That&#39;s One (V), you can loop it every turn for more retrieval, even vs. your own firing.<br />

<b><u>VIII. Mynocks ?</b></U><br />
<br /><br />
Mynocks: the rules about them are still obscure, and while I asked the SWCCGPC about some answers, they&#39;re still "deciding".<br />
The main problem with a Mynock is that they will attack starfighters. It&#39;s not sure if they would attack landed starfighters or not, since a landed starfighter has no power or hyperspeed.<br />
Still, this means, for the rules, that a landed starfighter has an "undefined value" for power and hyperspeed, which means, power=0 and hyperspeed=0.<br />
Basically, this could mean that the Mynocks would attack any landed starfighter (and thus, not your trooper) and then detach immediately. This would happen every battle phase.<br />
Well, since Disarming Creature (V) allows you to shoot at creatures at the same site, even if they are not attacking your character, there&#39;s no problem: the combo still works.<br />
So landing a starfighter to your creatures&#39; site won&#39;t help your opponent.<br />
If for some reason it is ruled that the creatures can&#39;t attack a landed starfighter, well, then they will attack your trooper, so no harm is done either.<br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
I could go on, but really, what&#39;s the point ?<br />
The deck&#39;s dead now anyway, or soon will.<br />
The point is: never, ever, underestimate the power of Crappy cards!<br />
They could, one day, like the hungry Mynocks, go haunt your worst nightmares!<br />
Losing to Mynocks ?<br />
Urk.<br />
<br />
Last note: this was going to be my Day 3 Deck at Worlds.<br />
Day 2 deck was a renewed version of MBO, updated. Will be out soon.<br />
