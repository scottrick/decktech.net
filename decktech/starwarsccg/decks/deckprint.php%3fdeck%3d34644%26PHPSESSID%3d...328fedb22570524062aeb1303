<br />
In today’s current meta where most decks are designed to engage in battles and most games are decided with only a few battles, MKOS is the best choice the dark side player has. In fact, I would say that this deck is a better meta choice then even Hunt Down.<br />
<br />
This is the first tournament that I brought this version of MKOS to. Prior to this I made the mistake of playing it with Myo and Abyssins. I find using Greedo as your Rep is much more efficient, especially when combined with Beedo. You see, the problem I had with Myo was that there was no reliable way to get him in my hand except to track him then draw him. But with Greedo you can just use Ket Maliss V to pull him. Now here is the trick, deploy Greedo and then replace him with Beedo, sending your Rep back into your life force to be used later. Initiate a battle with Beedo, send him to the lost pile and retrieve him via Scum & Villainy, Ability x 3 and or First Strike. I am sure people have been using the Greedo tech for years now but this is my first time and it works amazingly well. <br />
<br />
Starting<br />
Most of the time, your priority will be to get Tatooine up and running. Ideally you want to have Jabba at the Audience Chamber with Bib and some other useful forfeit along with Scum & Villainy and Hutt Bounty V. While it is not crucial to win, you should also try to get the Sail Barge set up at the Desert Heart along with the Passenger Deck, uRUrUuRurUr, his bantha and some more ability and forfeit. Especially if you are playing a Hidden Base or WYS. I want to also pay extra attention to the fact that there is practically no SAC in the deck. With such low destiny, Senses and Alters are not very realistic and I don’t have any controls in the deck. As soon as a high ability character hits the table like Quiggy or EPP Luke, the first thing I do in response is pull the Oppressive Enforcement shield just in case they try to Alter my Scum & Villainy…or any other of my interrupts. In fact, if I get the chance to verify there reserve deck and I spot quite a lot of SAC, it is not uncommon for me to pull the There Is No Try shield as well.<br />
<br />
Mid Game<br />
There is no set rule for what you should be doing during this part of the game but it should hopefully involve you battling your opponent and retrieving force. If you are playing against a space based deck, you should definitely make uRuRUrU and his bantha a priority. There are two Bantha Fodders in the deck just for that purpose. You can always deploy Jabba’s Cruiser via Power of the Hutt and load that up with characters. Remember, capital ships can deploy to systems even if there is no pilot aboard. Don’t be afraid to go to space. While there are limited amount of ships, you have plenty of opportunities to add multiple battle destinies with IG-88, 4-Lom, Boba Fett and BiHT. Once your objective is flipped those destinies will all be + 2 and you will be able to cancel your opponents destiny with your objective. There are also two Lateral Damages in there to help cripple any opposing ships. Finally, toss some extra aliens up there for forfeit and retrieve them back next turn via Scum & Villainy.<br />
<br />
If your playing against a ground deck, your even better off. Odds are that you will have more characters than them and you will be retrieving force at a much faster rate. Not too mention that you can reduce one character’s power to zero wherever you have a gangster thanks to Hutt Bounty V. Other than Jabba there are two other gangsters in the deck, Gardulla and Xizor, and both can be deployed using Jabba’s Influence or Twi’Lek V. You can also use your Ghhhks to make suicide runs in order to retrieve must have cards from your lost pile. If you can get Ability x3 V down as well, you should not have any problems getting your characters back. <br />
<br />
By using uRURUrUrUr and Bib Fortuna, you should be able to get what you need into your hand.<br />
<br />
Endgame<br />
The advantage of MKOS is that your characters deploy for so cheap that even towards the end you should still be able to deploy enough ability to draw a battle destiny. If the game is close, clearing the site is just as good or even better than controlling the site. Beyond that, there isn’t a whole lot else as far as the endgame goes. Your either winning or your not. If you are, then no worries. If it is really close, keep sticking it to them and try to get some force back via battling or Gardulla. If your losing, try to keep battling to retrieve that force. Lots of good players will be able to pull a win out of certain defeat. Give it a try sometime.<br />
<br />
One of the few problems that I have run into while playing this deck is that because of Hutt Bounty V, the amount of force you can activate can be ridiculous at times. Therefore, always relying on Jabba’s Influence to get out your aliens can sometimes be unreliable. Therefore I added a second copy of Twi’LekV. I feel that this card is key to getting certain characters out when you need them the most.<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
Gardulla the Hutt: She is hot! I would take this fat slob to bed if I could! Not only does she reduce the power of one character in a battle to zero in conjunction with Hutt Bounty V, but she retrieves force! Use her with Lando V and it becomes that much easier. I used to run Prophetess V which made it a guarantee every time, but she got squeezed out to make space for something better. Besides, I kind of like the unknown factor of the gamble.<br />
<br />
Bib Fortuna (Ref. 3): This little guy is so very underrated. Use his game text. Just try it. It is an amazing way to control the flow of your life force and to get what you want in your hand. I use it all the time.<br />
<br />
Rodian x 2: Yes I use two. In this decks early days when I was still using Myo, I only ran one Abyssin. After playing one game where I lost it too a force drain on my second turn and I was unable to ever flip, I decided that I needed two in the deck. <br />
<br />
Gela Yeens V: He is awesome against AiTC.<br />
<br />
Greedo x 3 and Beedo x 2: I find this to be the optimum number to make this setup really work. Some may like more, some may like less, but I like this.<br />
<br />
Ghhhk x 2: Two times the fun. Two times the suicide strikes. Two times the insurance policy in case things go horribly awry. Even more times if you retrieve one back with S&V. <br />
<br />
Masterful Move x 2: Cancels that pesky Savrip. Savrip is no good if your trying to kill his characters.<br />
<br />
Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch: This card is mandatory. If it is not in your Scum deck, stop what you are doing right now and add it in. In fact I would love to add another. This will take out any droid using A Gift, it will take out any other undercover spy, or what I did once, played the used portion, tracked it back into hand with urUruURuru and played it again. I think I did this for 4 or 5 turns in a row and they couldn’t grab it cause they had snagged something else! Mwwhahahaha!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Elis Helrot: Amazing vs. Agents I the Crapper. Or any other deck to that respect. The classic cards are still the best. Point in fact…<br />
<br />
Lateral Damage x 2: Winning games since 1995! This card has single handedly won me more games than any other card.<br />
<br />
Match Ups<br />
Hidden Base: Try to set up ururrUrUurUrU and his bantha at the Desert Heart as fast as you can. An early Gailid will also help out in a big way. Try to get as many drains in before they flip. Once they do flip get Jabba’s Cruiser out there probing away with lots of forfeit aboard. Get the other ships probing away as well. Lateral Damage is your best friend. As long as it doesn’t take forever to find their base, you should be able to win it. If they have an army of spies to blanket Tatooine then you may be in trouble, especially if they grab your Hutt Smooch. But who plays with that many spies? Right?<br />
<br />
WYS: This is typically a fun game with a lot of battling back and forth. Bureaucrat the Kessel drain and that will take care of that until he plays Control. Watch out for the “EPP Han, Chewie Enraged Life Debt” trick. It hurts every time. Make a run for the Cantina if you can. Deploying Jabba’s Cruiser from your reserve deck helps a lot, especially if you load it up with lots of guys. Once again, Lateral Damage will be your best friend. Try to get all your destiny adders in space. A very fun and totally winnable match up.<br />
<br />
MWYHL: I hate this deck. It is the bane of my existence. Set up uruRRURrUR with his bantha along with Bane V ASAP. The more drains you can get in early, the better. He retrieves lots of force so it will be hard to whittle him down. Hopefully by the time he completes his training, he won’t have enough force left to do anything. Probably my most problematic match up. <br />
<br />
Agents in the Crapper: Oh wow! I have play tested this match up countless times and it is fun every time. Beating the crap outa all those alien scrubs is sooo fun! Be sure to use Hutt Smooch on A Gift if it hits the table. Ellors V subtracts 2 from your battle destinies but Hutt Bounty still adds +1. Those gangsters in your deck will be very effective against your opponent’s characters. Multiple battle destinies are the way to go. Use IG-88 to send people to the used pile and add destinies. Boba Fett will help wipe out all those Kitonaks. Your activation will be HUGE thanks to Hutt Bounty. Starting the Audience Chamber is not a good idea. Use the Lower Passage instead. But don’t worry. Power of the Hutt gets you Jabba’s Barge and the barge gets you Jabba! Hooah! Just go to town on them. This deck is nowhere near as hard to beat as some people make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Ok, I have no spent three days writing up two deck submissions and one TR report. The TR report is 17 pages long by itself. Never mind the length of these deck submissions. My fingers are about to fall off. If you play any other deck, just deploy some aliens, initiate battles, retrieve force, draw lots of battle destinies and kill some characters. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
 If you have any questions or suggestions, by all means please contact me. <br />
