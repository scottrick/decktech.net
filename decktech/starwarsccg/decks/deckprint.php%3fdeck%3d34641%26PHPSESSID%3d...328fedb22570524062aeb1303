Now that I have finally purchased an R2 unit.<br />
<br />
WELL here it goes, and it will probably be edited AGAIN after V9&#39;s full complement comes out.<br />

*****and the Luke RS are now (V)*****<br />
<br />
<br />
You must understand that these are my brother&#39;s cards we are dealing with here, but nonetheless, this is what it looks like.<br />
<br />
Hopefully my little brother will go to some tourneys and trade for some dang cards that he needs.  I lack several myself, which is why I stay away from LSC.<br />
<br />
I do know that the new Luke will help, as does the (V) Obi Wan.  My brother has the THEED PALACE version of Mace, so we will have to see about getting the new virtual one that probably everyone will try and trade for.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, here is an EDITED version that will probably change AGAIN after V9 comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Haven&#39;t playtested this version, YET.<br />
<br />
<br />
CARD CHOICES:<br />
<br />
It&#39;s A Trap!:  Kills sniper and can cancel a battle where it looks like you will lose.  Allows you to set up your lsc for next turn if they don&#39;t move away.<br />
<br />
V9 Preview Luke:  my little bro doesn&#39;t have the DSII one, but he does have a pair of RFII ones that are now pretty cool when (V).<br />
<br />
Bionic Hand (V):  gets fished up and down out of your lost pile with Yoxgit and can either be used as a lsc destiny or to enhance Luke&#39;s power in battles.<br />
<br />
--------------------STRATEGY----------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, standard lsc with some drain potential at Kessel with the big navy. I took out some of the pilots so that there would be more gravy for the lsc.<br />
<br />
pull Bionic Hand (V) and keep using it forever.  You can even lose it to force drains and retrieve it using Yoxgit TO HAND!!!<br />
<br />
Let me know how everything looks, I understand that it does look substandard, but this is the best it is right now.<br />
