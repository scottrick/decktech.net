Here&#39;s my newest pile. I didn&#39;t want to post this, but I&#39;ve got to take it apart to find something new, and I want it listed somewhere first!!! Here&#39;s the deal. If they pull stuff before your turn ends, use Recoil In Fear. This single first-turn action generally wins you the game. People will pull what they need as soon as they can, from what I&#39;ve seen. Make &#39;em put it all back and find it the right way. In the process, make sure you drop your locations first, then Recoil, then put down more locations. Pull the H1:DB on your first turn. Depending on how many of your locations are in your deck, you&#39;ll wind up drawing your Force. If you didn&#39;t activate any locations, I&#39;d suggest using the Force to Recoil instead. If you don&#39;t have one, well then... I guess you&#39;d better draw.<br />
<br />
The Best Card Ever(tm) should be on the table for the majority of your turns this game. Flip the top card and be happy. Use it to battle. Use it to track. Use it to On The Edge (watch out for Tarkin(v) and Lando(v) shenanigans). Then get your Edge back during your Draw phase!!! Use it to get Savrip back. Use it to get ships back. Use it to get your just-lost character from a battle back. Heck, use it to get your Starting Interrupt back. With the number of unpullable 0s in the deck, it&#39;s not a half bad card at all.<br />
<br />
Yes, I actually spell-checked shenanigans.<br />
<br />
When you get an Escape Pod or a Signal, get Savrip. You need this on the table as soon as possible. Make sure you have a Sense in hand & a character on the table before you play it, though!!! Very important note. People are playing Masterful Move, after all... no sense in letting them cancel it.<br />
<br />
When Savrip & everything working, here&#39;s what happens. I realize it&#39;s old news to some of you, so BACK OFF!!! Let me explain my strategy. heh. Drop a character. Let&#39;s call him Pimp Luke. Drop another character elsewhere. Play The Best Card Ever(tm) to see that you&#39;ve got a 6 on top of the deck. Initiate with Luke, pick up the Battlin&#39; Yoda you lost a few turns ago to a drain into hand from your Lost pile. Draw a destiny. Lose your retrieved Yoda from hand to Savrip. Doesn&#39;t matter what he drew - Battlin&#39; Yoda forfeits for 9. Initiate with your other character. Retrieve the Yoda you just lost. What&#39;s that? Your top destiny is a 2? Okay, go ahead and activate one instead. Good - now it&#39;s a 5. Draw destiny. It&#39;s amazing! Did they draw low? Go ahead and keep the Yoda, lose the character. Drop down Yoda next to Luke, play Gift Of The Mentor, and smile.<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe not that last part. But basically the deck is stacked with forfeit 9 characters, the Spiral & Home One, and all kinds off goodies to make sure that once your characterexhaust the table, they stay there. And most of it can be retrieved! Spiral & Home One get picked up with Rebel Reinforcements, if The Best Card Ever(tm) isn&#39;t available.<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t really go into game specifics, because it&#39;s all the same - battle them, don&#39;t lose your characters unless you want to, drain next turn. Retrieve the character you just forfeited, and forfeit him again. It&#39;s amazing. Instead of deck matchups, I&#39;ll throw out some situations that have come up.<br />
<br />
SYCFA FEAR: I&#39;ve faced a tough one of these before. Fear only did damage 1 turn, I think. I tracked It Could Be Worse through the deck a lot, and I Altered it a few times. I put Lando in space on turn 3, and he never died the entire game (which lasted over an hour, btw). I couldn&#39;t find any other ships AT ALL - Lando was my only space force against his entire fleet. I know this deck is good because HE LIVED TO THE END OF THE GAME. That&#39;s just cool. I ended up losing this game by 7. Thus the inclusion of Rebel Reinforcements (v). Had I found just 1 more ship all game, I&#39;m confident I would have won.<br />
<br />
CCT: I have actually put Yoda in front of the CC Jail, forcing my opponent to make mistakes. I&#39;ve also put a Revo on the Jail, which is equally as amusing. In this case, they have to (a) burn a turn to put Fett (or Iggy) with Han, (b) drop Fett at the mercy of your mains in the Carbonite Chamber, (c) forgo their flip all together (if they&#39;re flipping), or (d) throw their cards across the table and quit before their first turn. I&#39;ve actually seen all 4 options done, and I have yet to lose to this matchup. In all reality, you don&#39;t do a bunch of damage because they stack their guys at their locations so much. Most of the time the game has been won with the drain at Kessel, of all silly things.<br />
<br />
Hunt Down: Ha. Your Jedi don&#39;t leave the table once they&#39;re deployed, remember? Awesome. If this (or any other saber-heavy deck) is big in your area, you might throw in a few Blaster Deflections in the deck. So far, I haven&#39;t had any trouble. Beat up Vader. The beat him up again. Then beat him up again. I&#39;m happy to report that I finally used Gift Of The Mentor with Yoda & Luke against this matchup for the first time, a goal I&#39;ve wanted to achieve since I first saw the card so many years ago.<br />
<br />
ISB: If you&#39;re expecting this deck (I play in AZ, we don&#39;t know what ISB means), pack Blount. He&#39;s a cool guy. You&#39;ll like him. I haven&#39;t played against this deck yet, though.<br />
<br />
WALKERS: Ha (again). Mechanical Failure is your friend. Especially if you use The Best Card Ever(tm) correctly to get it back every time. Ice Storm really isn&#39;t a big deal - a character goes missing, he gets found 2 turns later. Use It Could Be Worse against the damage, should any actually occur. If they&#39;re not playing Imperial Decree (v), they lose pretty much by default anyway. Even without the Revos.<br />
<br />
RAL OPS: The version I&#39;ve played against used Walkers. He never saw the Revos & Mech Failure coming. It was pitiful, really. I almost felt sorry for the guy. (you know who you are - heh.) I pwned his Revo&#39;d system & all sites, and he didn&#39;t have a single ability card on the table. He just gave up. I really enjoyed putting the Revo on his "drain -1" site that he controlled, and waiting for him to figure it out. This matchup is purely comical. Speeder Bikes would be more challenging, but since you act so much quicker you should have the upper hand. Revo on the system & holding it without opposition is key.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s pretty much it. Hope you like it! It&#39;s worked really well for me so far, but I&#39;m on to different things! Instead of making it an open deck, I&#39;ve got a few better ideas. heh heh heh...<br />
