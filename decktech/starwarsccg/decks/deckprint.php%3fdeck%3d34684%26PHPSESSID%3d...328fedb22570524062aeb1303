<br />
Several Reviewers have voiced concern over the Death Star being blown away.  It is much more difficult than it appears:  First they need a starfighter, this fact alone prevents 80% of light decks from doing it.  Secondly the starfighter must get to the DS, since most cant deploy directly there (no icons) they&#39;ll have to move there and sit for a turn where I could battle them.  Next they have to waste three turns moving to the core, during which they will most likely get returned to hand with Control/SFS.  If they do make it to the core they have to draw destiny + ability > 10 (WSDOE subtracts 2 from thier total).  this means an ability 4 pilot would need to draw a 7.  Trust me, since I added Control/SFS I have never been blown away in 20+ games (several agianst my Dad&#39;s weapon based WYS).<br />
<br />
No free executor because I can&#39;t pull it and I have more important effects to pull than TMNALTC.  I have tried it with the free Executor and found it just wasn&#39;t worth the space, besides I have never had any trouble holding bespin.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Strike Planning does suck, fortuneatly it has gone down in popularity since Drop and Thrown Back.  Also if they give you two icons you can still play Jerjerod 1st turn, otherwise you esentially lose your first turn which hurts but isn&#39;t the end of the world.  And it isnt worth wasting 3 card slots on the chance of them starting it.<br />
<br />
Yes, this was the deck in MD.<br />

<br />
This is a deck that I have been playing on and off ever since DS2 was released.  It has gone through many versions since I first started playing it and I believe that this is one of the best builds possible.  Since I have heard rumors of TTO getting some help in the next virual set I figured I’d post this now before it gets too popular.<br />
<br />
<u>General Strategy:</u><br />
<br />
Start off by playing the Death Star and IAO, then pulling your docking bay and playing Jerjerod there.  Pull your sector and if you have any force left draw up (maybe saving one for grabbing).  For the next few turns try to get Bespin out and have a ship and pilot to play there, all the while pulling your sectors.<br />
<br />
Once you have the Death Star up and running your next task is to set up on the ground.  You should have drawn a walker by now, so drop it with a pilot (preferably Veers or Igar).  This is the basic strategy for every game, once you are set up you can out damage nearly anything, easily causing upwards of 7 force lose per turn<br />
<br />
<u>Key Cards:</u><br />
<br />
<b>Do They Have A Code Clearance:</b>  This card makes is what makes the deck tick.  All of your imperials are forfeit 8 or 9, combine this with a few well timed Imperial Commands and you shouldn’t lose more than one character per battle.<br />
<b>Abiltiyx3 (V):</b>  Gets you your forfeited imperials back so you can lose them again, incredible when combine with Code Clearance.<br />
<b>Motti (V):</b>  Insane with the two above cards.  Deploys for 1, forfeits for 8, pulls KDY, adds to the power of your destroyers.<br />
<b>Superlaser:</b>  Shoots down the bright hope.<br />
<b>We’re In Attack Position Now:</b>  Makes guys cheaper in space and causes more direct damage on the ground with Veers and Igar.<br />
<b>Control/SFS:</b>  If they try to send someone in to blow up the Death Star, track a 5 and send them back to hand.  The DS2 rules say that characters can’t deploy to DS2 sectors so the ship is then stuck.  It also cancels Sense and force drains, an all around good card.<br />
<b>Four effect pullers:</b>  It is essential to get out your effects (with the possible exception of Decree).<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Other Random Notes:</u><br />
<br />
-The walkers ensure that your character keep their forfeit.<br />
-The second sector adds a destiny at the system the Death Star orbits.<br />
-10 cards indirectly pull Bespin so it should be out by the time you are ready to go there (Motti x2, 4 Effect pullers, KDY, Nemoidian Adv x2, and Bespin itself)<br />
<br />
<br />
It may not look like a great deck, but I have had a lot of success with it and if you are looking for something different to play I will highly recommend this deck.  It is surprisingly effective and your opponents will never see it coming.  This deck takes some practice playing to truly understand it, but if you ever see it in action I think you will be surprised at how good it is.  Thank you for reading this far and I greatly appreciate and constructive criticism you can offer.<br />
