<br />
First off some cards I would like to add it.<br />
Nabrun<br />
Palace Raider<br />
Arleil<br />
<br />
This deck is a blast to play.<br />
Some card choices<br />
<br />
Hutt Canyon - with a jawa there, the opponent gets 0 destiny.  With a palace raider and a jawa aboard the Patrol Craft you can get 2 destinies and one to power while they get none.  Amazing.<br />
<br />
Rogue Bantha - destiny 4, and kills Ur.  What more could you ask for.<br />
<br />
Attark - allows me to retrieve a palace raider each control phase once I flip.<br />
<br />
Marketplace - with lots of reacts, it allows me to hold this site with ease, using 2 force to retrieve during my turn.  With Loje, I am really not using up too much force for this.<br />
<br />
Rkk - A great jawa because of the ability to deploy for 1 with BTable out, plus allows me to cause some force loss with the Sabaac.<br />
<br />
Grabbers - I want to make sure that any and all interrupts are grabbed. allowing me to grab 3 interrupts makes a deck lose some key cards.  It all adds up against the opponet.<br />
<br />
Underworld - I can pull it with Wokling if I need to, but it allows me to stop conversion of my locations.<br />
<br />
The idea of this deck is to drop TBMask on the AC, then make it a non-bg with Bo Shuda, allowing me to control the location the rest of the game and giving me a huge advantage once I flip.<br />
<br />
Once I get the 5 different species out (remember the palace raiders do not count as species because its not stated in lore - not 100% sure about Lando though) I can start draining for 3 at a site (4 or 5 with tessek at certain sites.) <br />
<br />
Some obvious problems would be Cane Adiss or Battle Plan, but the deck is really very fast and with my small but steady amount of retrieval and lots of drain and batlte potential, I can really hurt the opponent quickly.<br />
<br />
Some issues of course would be Walkers or Combat but I think if I play correctly, the early damage from those decks can be avoided (Ultimatum is extremely useful as a shield here).<br />
<br />
The patrol crafts are key because with TBM I can get 2 destinies with a raider and weapons (other than p59/60) are not an issue.  Need be, I can also go to them with tanus and lando, using patrol crafts at their locations too.<br />
<br />
