Use ANSB first turn to pull EBG and one echo site, probably either the docking bay or war room.  Then use EBG to pull either hobbie or Luke.  If you will pull Hobbie (or whenever you do) make sure you have already pulled the docking bay and use Squad Ass. to pull his ship.  Second turn, depending on your starting hand, get either two echo sites or one site and then either the sensors or EBO.  Pull either Luke or Hobbie, whichever you didn&#39;t before.  This should get EBO set up pretty fast.<br />
     From here play smart.  I set up an arcona at the 4th marker most of the time to keep a battlegroud site.  I am wary to do so, however, if I don&#39;t yet have either Control or Houjix.  The other Arcona I normally send to one of their draining sites to help cancel them.  Boushh also helps here, of course.<br />
     I start Launching the Assult to be sure that Home 1 can get out when I need it, as well as adding to a drain here and there.<br />
     The Sensors and Ice storm are a fun combo that really help me feel safe.  If they deploy to the 4th marker, not only do I get to activate some nice force, but they can&#39;t move.  That leaves characters open to an ice storm next turn.<br />
     As a side note, Screaming Lando is usually on the Falcon while EPP Chewie helps hold Echo.  Also, I would play Naked Threepio...if I had one.  Same with D*2 Wedge.  I know he&#39;s better, just need to find one.<br />
    Well, any help will be greatly appreciated. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
