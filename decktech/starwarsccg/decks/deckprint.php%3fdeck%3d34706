Basic Strategy:<br />
First Turn: Pull Yoda&#39;s Hut (if DS didn&#39;t give me two force) and pull Yoda (v) and Yoda&#39;s Hope. If DS gives you two force Pull Training Area, Daughter, Yoda, Luke&#39;s Backpack, Yoda&#39;s Hope, Test One. <br />
<br />
Second Turn: Activate only enough to deploy daughter. Pull Training Area (if DS Didn&#39;t give you force), Test One and Daughter with Luke’s Backpack. <br />
<br />
Third Turn DS: Pull Jedi Test 2.<br />
<br />
Third Turn LS: Complete Test 1 and retrieve 3 force. Pull a Test and a site, play the site so that daughter is in the middle of all of them. Play test 2 load Yoda up if he is not and run after test 2. Pull and Play Threepio With parts showing and beginning tracking.<br />
<br />
Turn Four: Complete Test 2 and three and setup for four. If there are guys on ground now is your time to start clearing sites. use the EPP qui gon, lando, and corran to mop up the sites. Corran is used best late game but early you should be retrieving enough that when he dies he can come back. <br />
<br />
Turn Five: Complete test four and if you cannot then just setup for it. Clear sites and now start clearing and holding space Falcon can draw four destinies with life debt and you can get life debt back by completing a jedi test or They Win This Round. Use They Win This Round to your favor great with qui gon, corran and hojinx.  Look for your site (or system if they are playing ground). <br />
<br />
Turn Six: Complete Test 5 with Artoo in Red 5 on it. Play test 6 and send yoda to the hut and yoda’s hope to the lost pile (retrieve later with on the edge or they win this round). Play your site (or system) with luke and lightsaber with a backup character if you need one (or Home One and Bright Hope (v)). Start retrieving with On The Edge. <br />
<br />
Rest of the game:<br />
Hold one drain site/system with your luke beast. If the DS plays vader to a battle ground save 13 force and pull leia up during your deploy play her to vader’s site and then during your move phase duel and then bring her back up, regardless of the outcome of the duel. <br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
Corran Horn/Jar Jar Binks: I can’t decide which one I want to play; with corran he breaks cover and draws a battle destiny but can not deploy to DS II. Jar Jar can get the DS II and can blow up a guy and with Wessa gotta grand army can get ride of a spy and deploys for only 2, but doesn’t draw a destiny. So I change it back and forth to how I am feeling.<br />
<br />
Two Daughter of Skywalkers: <br />
I do this because I have terrible luck with having only one of her. I will activate her, she will be in my opening hand, or something it just sucks; so I run two as to not kill my sefl drawing her. <br />
<br />
You Must Confront Vader:<br />
Two reasons why I run this card: an extra battle destiny in every battle if completed and direct damage to space or alien decks. Also it is a six destiny card. <br />
<br />
Obi Wan Kenobi, Padawan Learner:<br />
Why no Obi Wan with lightsaber? Again two reasons: Against tatooine decks (very popular right now) this one is a beast, and against the damn sidious he is not removed from play because he is not a jedi I only run a couple of characters and most are jedis, I only run two Escape Pod (v) to counter him but I would rather use those for luke and qui gon then worry about obi also. A third reason that just came up is that Obi Wan is neither a jedi or a rebel which means that he is also immune to maul strikes, Tat Maul and I have you now. <br />
<br />
Match Ups<br />
<br />
Hunt Down:<br />
Always fun for me: Well Honor is on the table from turn one so there goes all the damage from Visage and Search and Destroy until No escape hits the table, but by that time both those cards are canceled anyway. Clear Vader with qui gon and lando, have luke and obi face off against emperor, maul, blizzard etc. If it is the duel verson. If not then just don’t play luke of lando, drain in space and hit the ground with qui gon and obi wan. hard but not terrible.<br />
<br />
Set Your Course Fear (v)<br />
I hate this match up. Very tough match, you can’t really reduce their drains, you can not remove fear (v) and you can not compete in space except to slow them down early game, but watch out. Fear can drop Imperial Class Star Destroyers for 1-3 apiece. Start early with the drains on ground, you will most likely face either epps or undercover spies, use corran and hope not to get hit. Test 3 comes in handy here (reduce DS destiny by one).<br />
<br />
Maul Deck:<br />
Get obi wan down and fighting with some help from qui gon and lando; send luke over to hang out on naboo and drain them for three a turn: DS will come after him but by the time they do you should have a seven on test five so he will stay they will go. Moderate Match.<br />
<br />
Alien decks:<br />
Hit them hard and hit them early and fast, and keep hitting them every turn but never give them a chance to battle you. Capture can suck but most of all there destinies are reduced by the time capturing can really be done. Moderate Match.<br />
<br />
Cloud City:<br />
First turn Executor sucks so wait until you can wipe it out with the falcon and life debt. Hit and run on the ground. Dark deal is nothing to worry about. Just make them lose forces on the ground while retrieving with they win this round. Moderate Match.<br />
<br />
I can’t think of any other match ups that are popular right now but if you think of one D mail me. <br />

Thanks for taking a look.<br />
