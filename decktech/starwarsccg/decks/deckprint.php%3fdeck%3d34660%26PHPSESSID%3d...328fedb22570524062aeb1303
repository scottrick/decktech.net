This deck usually generates about 20 force by the third turn, unless your opponent does something stupid, like come at you at the AC.  If they do the game will not be slow insanity.  Mosep, Gailid, and Myoom are in there to give you a conrol advantage over opponent.  Seeing their hand with give you the ability to fortify or spead and drain.  Also, the drains off the top of reserve will force opponent to deal with the AC, normally resulting in battle damage for opponent.<br />
<br />
If you have evasion in opening hand, drop Bib to Entrance cavern from reserve for free. Draw or save.<br />
<br />
If no evasion, drop Audience chamber Jabba v from reserve, download scum.  Play ephont mon or Boelo if Ephont Mon unavailible.  Play Hutt Bounty v.<br />
<br />
The rest of the game should change based on matchups.  Gailid and Mosep help against decks that don&#39;t oppose you at JP.  Drains of 5 off the top of reserve should swing this matchup in your favor against Hidden Base of WYS.<br />
<br />
AITC: Play Jabba, Ephont Mon, Gailid, Mosep, Myoom, Bib to AC.  Myoom should help keep some of their characters in check.  You have +3(+1 with ellors) to each battle destiny draw.  Use Xizor v to make more characters draw destiny if unable.  Play secret plans shield.  Look for any opportunity to elis for a huge beatdown.<br />
<br />
Throne Room:  You should outgenerate your opponent by about 8 per turn.  With Myoom being able to get around Goo Nee Tay with Molator v, this game could be over quick.<br />
<br />
Hidden Base:  Pull Gailid Second turn followed by Mosep.  Use myoom to keep ground characters off your back.  Look for Bane v to seal the victory.<br />
<br />
WYS:  Flip first turn, with only tat locations on table.  Stay out of space until you feel confident of holding Kessel of Tatooine(normally after opponent has spread forces.  Use the MM combo to cancel celebration.  Play Secret Plans shield.  Make opponent react to Myoom.  If you outgenerate opponent by 10 or more this will be an easy matchup.<br />
<br />
All other match-up:  Just battle, force drain and play smart.  The cards should be in there to help you win. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
