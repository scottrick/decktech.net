<br />
It helped me to win both days 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
It went 6-1 all three days combined only losing to Micheal Ravelings Speeders on day 2.<br />
<br />
This is the most solid Huntdown that I have ever played with.<br />
<br />
Now for some card choices:<br />
<br />
You Cannot Hide Forever & Mobilization Points as the third effect?<br />
<br />
Yes, but against a good number of decks you will need to start Imperial Decree (v) for activation and damage reduction (such as speeders, TRM and possibly Profit)<br />
<br />
Darth Sidious?<br />
<br />
He&#39;s awesome against TRM and yes I did place Jedi Luke and Qui-Gon out of play with him so he&#39;s worth it.<br />
<br />
The Vader selection?<br />
<br />
As far as this goes this is simply the best.<br />
You can keep getting back D.V.D.L.O.T.S. with AAA (v) so you never run out of vaders but really EPP vader is the best because it&#39;s not worth the loss of the saber just to try to keep him on the table at all times because that never works against good players.<br />
<br />
Emperor Palpatine instead of The Emperor (v)?<br />
<br />
This is acually a tougher call because The Emperor (v) can keep frying guys as well as satisfy Search & destroy but Emperor Palpatine is destiny of 6 and it seems like I draw one of them for destiny all the time so I&#39;ll go with him.<br />
<br />
Mara Jade?<br />
<br />
Hell yeah! It&#39;s a real big mistake not to play with her! With TRM, twixes and being your only spy it&#39;s a must this acually made a big difference against Brandon.<br />
<br />
AAA (v)?<br />
<br />
This is good enough to be in here because it&#39;s great for getting back someone like Mara or Sidious.<br />
<br />
Search And Destroy is great against MBO.<br />
<br />
The Emperor&#39;s Prize (v) helps a lot with speeders and Luke Skywalker (v)<br />
<br />
Regular Ghhhk and no combo?<br />
<br />
Absolutely, with all those Musicians going around you gotta be able to pull it when you need it with a Masterful Move if necessary.<br />
<br />
Masterful Move Combo x2?<br />
OMG, this is so good against TRM (Savrip canceler) and celebration is annoying so don&#39;t put up with it.<br />
<br />
Stunning leader x2?<br />
<br />
This card is money! You will laugh against a lot of match-ups if thet try to beat you down at interior sites. Cancel the battle then on your turn beat their @$$ as hard as you can if applicable.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s pretty pricey to get away from the Blockade Flagship: Docking Bay for your opponent so go ahead and trap them there.<br />
<br />
No extra activation (Blockade Flagship:Bridge or Imperial:Holotable)?<br />
<br />
This deck dosen&#39;t need much.<br />
If you put in the Blockade Flagship: Bridge, once you deploy it that would give them a site to escape to if they&#39;re at the Blockade Flagship: Docking Bay.<br />
You don&#39;t have room to waste putting in the Holotable either (you would need other cards in here to go along with it: The Phantom Menace, Holonet Transmission etc.).<br />
If for some reason you do get force choked, that&#39;s what Imperial Decree (v) is for.<br />
 <br />
The rest of the card choices are pretty obvious so I won&#39;t go into much detail on them.<br />
<br />
Now for the Match-ups:<br />
<br />
TRM- Throw down Vader and flip a.s.a.p. but be sure to have a Ghhhk, Stunning Leader, You are Beaten or Sniper combo in hand unless you think your opponent has complete @$$ in their hand. If you don&#39;t have an important interrupt in your hand just wait and put him down with someone else unless of course they aren&#39;t activating but about 6 force or less. From there just try to win battles and drain in space and with Mara late game for the win. It is going to be a close game. But don&#39;t forget to start Imperial Decree (v) as the third effect instead of Mob. Points combo. <br />
Profit- Start two aliens in the chamber (Mara and Dr. e) and be sure to get the ghhhk in hand if they start Uh-oh. From there it is a very similar game to TRM. You want Vader down to the AC on turn 1 if at all possible. Spreading out early by moving Mara over to drain at Tatooine: Jabba&#39;s Palace against new profit is so dumb don&#39;t even think about doing it. Put a ship down alone in space to drain, hit them with visage and then do some counter beats. It&#39;s a very interactive match-up, so don&#39;t be stupid and try to spread out fast.<br />
<br />
Speeders- Sorry but better luck next game. I guess The Emperor&#39;s Prize (v), Imperial Decree (v) and some perfect play will make it close but don&#39;t count on winning this game at all.<br />
<br />
Hidden Base- Not an easy match but it&#39;s very possible to win. the strategy depends on what type of Hidden Base you are playing against though of course. Let&#39;s say that you are playing against my personal favorite HBX with matching speeders. Ok so don&#39;t bother setting up Search and destroy early because it won&#39;t work with a speeder pilot satisfying it. First thing you want to try and do is activate or draw a ship very early of you will not have a good shot at the win. After that you can wait till they flip so you can probe. In the meantime you want to flip with Vader and have Mara and saber one at each DB. Knock the crap out of the luke in speeder with EPP Maul aboard Blizzard 4 along with I have you now. Once Luke is cleared flip back play Search and destroy and get ready to go to space. If you play smart you will have a chance. If you play bad you will lose.<br />
MBO- Just do as much damage as you can as early as you can with drains, Visage and Search And Destroy but try to beat down with Mara early also. Once you think you can get away with it go to space but don&#39;t be afraid of them blowing up the Death Star because all that does is decrease you differential. I beat "Cubs Fan" and "Rypcord" with this deck against this match-up so don&#39;t be afraid of it just play like a pro and you&#39;ll be ok.<br />
<br />
Senate- Yes I acually played against LS senate day 2 so I will mention it. There is only one thing you need to do that is key and that is lay down a counter beat of about 10-15 overflow for the win. Also it will help if you don&#39;t get beat down yourself so get a Stunning Leader or Ghhhk in hand so you can spread out to try to lure them into doing the same. Oce you get Mara at the Council Chamber they will come after her so be careful not to get beatdown. Just do what you can to beatdown and you will win.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s all the match-ups that I can think of that I played against at GenCon so if there is anything you want to see put in here before you rate it let me know so I can help you out.<br />
<br />
RST (bonus match-up #1 by request)- Here&#39;s one that you don&#39;t run into much.<br />
I&#39;ve never played against that match-up with this version of the deck but I know that it&#39;s in this decks favor.<br />
One thing you need to watch out for is if you know that Scott Lingrell is going to be there.<br />
You will want to add back in This Is Some Rescue x3 to stop OOC. I knew he wasn&#39;t going to be at GenCon and every other player that would be a threat would be playing something else.<br />
But your bacic strategy is to deploy vader to the Endor: Rebel Landing Site (hopefully with Blizzard 4) first turn and flip.<br />
They will come after you so DO NOT spread out early on the ground.<br />
Most of these decks don&#39;t play much space if any, so unless they are playing with Squadron Assignments or Get To Your Ships, go ahead and throw down a lone ship to a system (you can hold the ghhhk in you&#39;re not feeling comfortable with it).<br />
Once your set up on the ground and in space make sure to drain and to make them spend 3 to drain.<br />
Don&#39;t forget about visage, win battles and stop retrieval.<br />
If this one is really big in your area you can also cut a Visage for Closed Door (Endor Destiny 7 effect that you can grab with YCHF & Mob. Points).<br />
<br />
Good luck-Nick <br />
