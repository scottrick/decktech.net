He took the deck to a 3-0 finish at states even though he hadn&#39;t played in years and had no idea what the deck did except for a 5 minute explanation before states.  While Utah doesn&#39;t have the highest rated group of players, just thought I would add that in there.  <br />
<br />
Brief History.  Right before Worlds 2006 I hadnt had time to build any decks for the game.  My son was about a month old and we had just moved into our house, so real life was keeping me from having time to devote to deck building.  I had gotten a collection from a player from Denver area that had a WHAP deck all built.  I had never played it so I thought Id keep it together and take it to worlds.  I tested it with Team TN and usually won the first game I played against them because of the tricks in the deck but would consistently lose every game after that.  Its more the surprise factor in the deck.  I realized while it retrieved like a beast and had lots of tricks, it couldnt fight at all.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I went 1-2 at Worlds Day 2 with it.  But I saw what needed to be changed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I read Aglets deck lists and looked to see what he was playing and decided I wanted more power in mine.  With V12, it gave us Ki V, another Jedi that can use a Saber and go right to the Throne room through Secure Route.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
So after spending much time figuring out what worked best, this is my current form.  The deck is a beast and for anyone that says WHAP isnt mains or isnt Type 1, I disagree, this is Type 1 and can beat any DS with the exception of Fear which will be a struggle.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This current version has gone 6-1, with its only loss against Hunters Fear.  It has beaten Fear, Scum, Hunt Down, Walkers, IG-88 and BHBM.  <br /><br />

<br /><br />
Some card changes.  The amount of Atrocities can change.  In my local Meta, I use 2 and then put in two more Alters and whatever else feels needed.  When I know its going to be a heavy Fear Environment, I put in 8 Atrocities.  This basically makes it so your Jedi will always hit with Sabers and you will be doing at least 6 attrition.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Advantages of this deck:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Force:  You dont need to flip to be effective with this deck, though it helps, but the extra 1 force activation on each players turn from the objective is Tech.  You get 5 total from the sites you start with, 1 from your objective on both turns, plus one for Wokling V and one for yourself.  So a total of 9 just from yourself each turn.  That gives you enough to get a Jedi down, a Amidala Beat squad or whatever you need.  Plus you have the extra site in the deck for an extra three force for once your flipped.  This deck hardly pulls, so you should be able to enjoy the benefits of Drop/Thrown Back just fine without giving the DS any help.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Retrieval:  This is huge in this deck.  With Secure Route, I will most often play Control/Tunnel Vision for a card from my Force Pile, play a Republic character and retrieve the Control Combo.  Ill usually hold back a Republic character in my hand so I dont play them all at once so I can get that card out of the lost pile each turn.  You have a max of 4 Musicians in the deck, so thats 4 retrieval possible a turn, plus Figrin Dan could get you another 1, so thats 5 total a turn.  You have one Flash of Insight V for more retrieval as well as Civil Disorder that can get any character back except Qui with stick.  Thats a max total of 8 retrieval a turn, I would say your most likely to get a total of 4 a turn on average.  On top of that, you also get one more back at anytime with Wokling V.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Getting the Queen:  Each game at WN I didnt get her in my opening hand, thats not good.  Sense and Recoil will help you try to get her as well as the Tunnel Visions from Force pile.  You also have the little republic character that fetches her and you have a regular Padme that also works, though her only redeeming quality is getting another Jedi which is actually really nice if you need to clear the Throne Room.  But you should always be able to pull her somehow first turn if you need too and with six in the deck, its bad odds if you dont just have one to begin with.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Draining  Both Sides:  WHAP when flipped caps the DSs force drains to 2 total, so you never have to worry about huge drains.  Using as many Atrocities in the Deck works perfect with this capped drain of 2.  LS drains can be hurt by ROPS and ISB, but other than that, you should be draining at the Throne Room, one other site on Naboo, and wherever you decide to send your beat squad.  With 3 total Sabers, thats an extra possibility of 3 extra to drains a turn.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Direct Damage  This is a possibility of 4 a turn.  You just have to have the Queen and Panaka at different Sites.  With the amount of characters in the deck, that isnt hard to do.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Jedi  While most WHAP decks only use smaller aliens and the Republic Characters.  Mace, Obi, Yoda, and Ki can all use Sabers that add +1 to drains, have some form of immunity to attrition (except Ki who is the weakest of the group) and can stick around on table.  Then you also have Qui with stick.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The best thing here is that Obi and Ki can play to the Throne Room, giving you a beat squad on anyone trying to keep you from controlling it.  Have an annoying Emp or Vader at the Throne Room.  Queen Amidala plays for 3, Janick then plays for 1 and Panaka plays free (thats 11 power for 4 force), now play down Obi with stick and you have 17 power, can cancel a destiny, swing with stick, and all these guys are defense plus 2 and at least immune to attrition smaller than 3.  Its a beast and this sort of thing happens often. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Destiny Canceling  probably the biggest strength of the deck.  Especially against playing against someone playing HD where the destinies tend to be bigger.  Being able to cancel any destiny draw of 4 or bigger once per any battle for one force is huge.  Combine that with Im With you Too V for the smaller destinies, you have a deck that will never lose a character from table unless choked or swung on.  Queen Amidala gives all Republic characters immunity to destiny less than 3 at her same site, so basically the only destiny number that can hurt most games is 3 exactly.  Otherwise you cancel it or your immune to it.  With the fact that your characters also get +2 to their defense Value, makes it really tough to hit a guy, (just ask Kevin Shannon as he missed around 8 times with Dengar firing).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Early Game:<br /><br />
Their turn activate 1.  If they give you enough from downloading, once you get to three force, use it through Wokling to get a Secure Route into hand if its not already there.  If they only give you the 1 force, on your turn, once you have activated the other two force, go grab it.  Usually this is when you have to make the decision of either going to screw DS over or just do your thing.  Against my game against Kevin Shannon at WN, he had put down two aliens at Jabbas Palace, thats just easy kills for Mace, so Mace, with stick, hit both and cleared the site easily and sat there most of the game going unharmed.  Against Fear, I put down Queen right away to flip and got an alien at the exterior site and moved them together, to start a drain, ping for 2 and retrieve 1.  But you have to decide what will work best, if you know you can put down Mace and let him sit, do it.  If you feel your queen will be safe do that too.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mid Game:  <br /><br />
You should be pinging them for at least two a turn.  Usually you have the Throne Room in your hands and they dont want to go there.  You also should have at least 1 of their sites cleared out by a Jedi who shouldnt be leaving the table all game.  Battling should be easy wins for you right now and you should be retrieving around 4 a turn.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Late Game:  <br /><br />
Usually the game is in hand right now and your just losing force from hand and draining them out while trying to retrieve all you can.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Matches you dont want to see:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
FEAR/SYCFA:  This is basically a game of what each person draws.  You usually can flip first turn and start doing damage.  Depending on how many Atrocities your running depends on how youre going to do.  Also if they are playing any hit and run characters, that can really hurt you too.   Against Hunter, I played 4 Atrocities and he controlled 2 of them the first time he drained/Feared me.  Its a close game and all depends on how its built.  I would say Hunter is one of the Best Fear players in the game, so I would think that he would have a better chance against this than any other player.  This is the worst match up and not what you want to see at an event.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Matches that will be close but you should be able to pull out:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
BHBM:  This deck can plop Emp down first turn to the Throne Room and unless you get there and clear him, they will continue to stack character after character there and that will kill you.  Ive almost thought about throwing in a Revo or 2 just to hurt this and HD.  If you can clear Emp with a first turn Obi, you will be set the rest of the game.  The good thing about all the Atrocities is that you should be able to hit whatever character is sitting there easily.  You can win this match, its just tough.  Thats why WHAP needs all the Jedi it has, so that if someone is just piling up character after character at the TR, you should be able to clear.  If Mace/Qui/Yoda were Republic Characters, it would be even better.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ROPS:  This deck makes all LS drains -1 once they flip and that can really hurt WHAP.  But LS retrieves a lot each turn.  If ROPS is big in your area, youll want to put in the two Alters I mentioned before to try to get rid of their space damage and free drains.  Usually if you can get two Jedi down and not get killed right away from force damage, you should be able to survive, with the retrieval and lack of characters that actually work well of off Raltir, you should be able to pull out a win.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ISB:  This all depends on the build but they also make drains minus one if they stick someone like the premiere droid on the planet and unless I draw into my Sorry About the Mess, it can really hurt this deck.  You have direct damage and retrieval, just like against ROPS.  It also depends on the DS build of this, if its Big Blue or drop and drain or whatever it might be.  You should be able to win this game if you play it smart and dont leave any of your characters open to a beat down.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decks that are almost Auto Wins:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hunt Down:  This match is almost too easy for you.  You will basically keep them flipped all game because of having so many Jedi out.  Against 1000Needles, he had Vader out around 3 times and never was able to take me down.  Having both people lose 1 force a turn and with the amount that LS retrieves, it hardly puts a dent in the LS player while it slowly takes down DS.  The key here is flipping right away and keeping the TR in your control and not letting it flip back.  As long as you keep the destiny canceling at bigger than three, youre safe.  The one bad is that choke Vader targets characters ability, so the smaller Republic characters and aliens are toast in this match.    <br /><br />
<br /><br />
IG-88:  This is an interesting match but one that LS should with, with its amount of retrieval and the fact that there are so many Jedi with Sabers, you should be able to take the Audience Chamber or stick two Jedi on Cloud City and go after IG.  Since your playing Sack, you can get rid of some of their tricks.  Your direct damage of 2-4 a turn should also shut down this deck.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Endor OPS/Tanks:  This comes down to the fact that you retrieve a lot and do direct damage.  You have 3 total interior sites that you can just sit and retrieve 3 and drain/ping at without having to worry about Tanks inside.  That leaves them with two sites total where Tanks can sit.  You should be able to drain and damage them quickly while getting back a lot early game to help yourself late game.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Walkers:  By the time the 8 force damage comes your way, you shouldnt have anything in your lost pile, so it shouldnt hurt you much.  You are doing 2-4 ping damage and draining with retrieval all game.  You can send a few Jedi to Hoth and see if they can slow down drains and damage there, but you should win as you will have a jump start on them.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Senate:  They cant stop your direct damage and depending on what build they are running, will not be as fast as you doing damage or retrieving.  They can stop a few drains or add two to theirs, but thats what the Controls will come in Handy.  Michael E. was running around 15 or so total senators and then tanks with a deck he had at WN.  This sort of build would be easy for WHAP, as it can set up so much quicker and the direct damage will just shut it down.  It cant retrieve nearly as quickly as WHAP and just doesnt have the direct damage to handle it.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Scum Builds:  Really this is one of the easiest matches youll find.  Mainly because a Mace or Obi first turn that clears out a site will set them back.  You have a guy in their area and they have nothing in yours.  You usually will flip second turn on this one and once you flip, you can just drain and ping them for so much that they cant handle it.  While they have retrieval, you have more and cancelling Scum is a priority.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hope this shows a little more to people about why WHAP should be considered a Type 1 deck and that it is a mains deck.  While you dont run Luke or Leia, you run all the powerful Jedi and have tons of retrieval and direct damage.  <br /><br />
