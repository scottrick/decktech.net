Drop (V) is actually Thrown Back (V).<br />
<br />
For starters, I&#39;ll be the first to admit that Lightsaber Combat is at a low point right now.  Even though this deck won its two matchups at my recent local, I have no doubt that it was in large part due to the luck of the draw.  I&#39;ll also admit that this deck probably wouldn&#39;t fare so well at more advanced tournaments.<br />
<br />
The first thing people will probably notice is the starting interrupt: The Signal (V) over the more conventional Heading for the Medical Frigate.  This choice was made because the two Naboo battlegrounds obviously give up way too much Force.  I wanted a start that would allow me to get Obi-Wan&#39;s Apparition into hand from the get-go, so as to cap some of that generation ASAP if my opponent started locations that had a lot of dark icons.  This worked well when I faced Hunt Down - they had 2 more Force than be my default, then pulled out the Executor Docking Bay on their turn.  Also works if they pull Rendili with Mobilization Points.  Wars Not Make One Great (V) is good in protecting your Jedi from the Vader + Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter + Darth Maul + I Have You Now + Maul Strikes mega-beatdown, which actually happened to me on the 2nd dark side turn when I first started playing combat.  The Insight combo makes their Dark Jedi a little easier to kill, and can be ditched to get Wokling (V) if you need the extra Force.  Honor of the Jedi is a no-brainer against DS decks that cause direct damage, although if they start No Escape you may want to start with a copy of Down with the Emperor (V) in hand instead.<br />
<br />
From there you have basic LSC - try to get either Qui-Gon or Yoda, MOTF down to Naboo first turn.  If you have Qui-Gon, I&#39;d go ahead and plop him straight to the core.  Yoda I usually send to the Generator, since he needs the extra power +2 boost.<br />
<br />
The three copies of non-virtual Signal are to get Sai&#39;Torr Kal Fas (V) out if you can.  Since you don&#39;t start it, getting Qui-Gon&#39;s saber is a bit of a bear.  Signal is also good for pulling Goo Nee Tay, to further try to compensate for your massive initial giveaway of Force.<br />
<br />
Boss Nass&#39; Chambers and Wesa Gotta Grand Army are there for the extra 2 Force that you can&#39;t be drained for.  I found that, while the icons off the two generator sites were usually sufficient for dropping Qui-Gon and Yoda, it was a bit difficult to pay the 8 Force for LS,JK without some extra icons.<br />
<br />
A lot of the other stuff in this deck are personal choices.  For example, the Admiral&#39;s Order probably isn&#39;t really necessary.  I stocked it because I was running into trouble with a Dark Side AO the last few times I played, so I needed sometihng to replace it.  The Force Is Strong With This One can probably be replaced with any other destiny adder (Gift of the Mentor, Skywalkers, Warrior&#39;s Courage...).  I originally didn&#39;t have it, but put it in since one destiny wasn&#39;t enough to take down Vader + Grand Moff Tarkin with Down With the Emperor (V) in play (stupid Tarkin canceling my destiny draw).<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve only played this deck against two DS decktypes, so I will tell you what I can.<br />
<br />
Hunt Down: The first time I played LSC against Hunt Down, I got creamed.  The second time, with this deck design, things went well.  Keep your Obi-Wan&#39;s Apparition handy.  If they pull Rendili or Executor: Docking Bay on their turn, drop the Apparition on the Holotheater (or, if they have the Exec DB, put it on the middle of the three Executor sites to shut all three down).  Other than that, keep Jedi on Naboo to keep them flipped.  If they didn&#39;t start No Escape, you shouldn&#39;t be taking any Visage damage early on.  Use combat cards if they don&#39;t have AAA(V).  If they do, the destinies in this deck should be hight enough that you can afford to combat blind.  Try to get Qui-Gon a weapon at the core so that if they show up with the likes of Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter or P-59 to battle you, you can hit them and send them away immediately.  Try to smack Vader around as much as possible, and keep him off the table as much as possible.  I suspect that I won my second bout with Hunt Down due in no small portion to an ill-fated (well, for my opponent anyway) Epic Duel early on in which Obi bested Vader.<br />
<br />
Walkers: This turns out to be a fairly non-interactive matchup, especially with my lack of a space force.  The best you can do is try to harass your opponent&#39;s Walker setup early on with Down With the Emperor (V) and Obi-Wan and Luke.  The matchup I played didn&#39;t deploy the third marker until AFTER blowing the shield, but I lucked out and drew a Corran Horn along with Obi-Wan in my opening hand.  Using my Force icons plus the ones the Walkers setup gave me and Wokling (V), I had enough Force to send them both to the 5th Marker to pick on Vader in Blizzard 1.  With Down With the Emperor (V) out, Vader&#39;s immunity gets broken by a draw of 2 or higher.  That&#39;s also enough to break Blizzard 1&#39;s immunity.  Other than that, hold down the two Naboo sites and try to get some space presence at Hoth to satisfy Battle Order.  I ended up failing at that task so I paid to drain every turn, which didn&#39;t really matter to me since I wasn&#39;t using Force to deploy people anyway.  I won the drain race by 8 Force.  The only other thing is to watch out for Ice Storm!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t have any other matchups to speak of knowledgeably right now.  I&#39;m sure there are plenty out there that will crush this deck.  Personally I&#39;d probably only give this deck 3 stars at most, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m posting it here - to see if anyone else can suggest some ways to improve it, given that LSC is weak right now anyway.  Thanks!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
