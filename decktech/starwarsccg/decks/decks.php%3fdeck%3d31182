<br />
ALTERNATE CARD CHOICES:<br />
Captain Godhert for DS-61-3.  Godhert cancels Claw and should help you vs any deck that uses it.<br />
<br />
LENGTHY RESPOSNES TO REVIEWS:<br />
jeeps: Actually the correct thing to do is to catch Alter.  With FWKTIL(V) on table doing damage, the opponent will be hard pressed to lose 3 cards (via TINT/OE) to send one of your Imp Commands to the Used Pile.  The Alters are what you need to get rid of completely and irretrievably.  Senses are annoying, but the game, as I recall, is about making your opponent lose Force.  FWKTIL(V) has a much higher potential to cause Force loss (and thus win games) than Imp Command.  Decks that use SAC (Combat, Senate, TRM, Profit maybe) are decks you are doing to be drain racing to begin with.  You need to keep the damage up and you can move around their space.<br />
Against WHAP or someone who uses Ultimatum, my drain potential is decreased by a whopping 1 Force.  That is Kiffex with Chiraneau on table.  I&#39;m not highly worried about this.  With Imperial Attrocity (V), the thing to remember is that FWTIKL (V) is a single loss of force.  Thus, if I control 3 systems and IA(V) is on table, the opponent loses 3*2-1 = 7 Force.  Inconvenient, yes.  But not as inconvenient as 7 Force loss a turn that I don&#39;t have to pay for (not to mention those drains).<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER:<br />
<br />
Please read this strategy section.  The amount of time I&#39;ve spent working on and testing this deck is astronomical, so I have a lot to say about it.  I took a lot of time to write this, and I know it&#39;s long, but try to bear with me and read as much as you can.<br />
<br />
My advice for anyone building this deck is to resist the temptation to put in bullet interrupts like Unsalvageable or high deploy cards like Darth Vader or Executor that slow down and decrease the synergy of the deck.  The beauty of this deck is that your hand can&#39;t suck.  Every card you draw is 1 more cog in the Imperial War Machine.  When I played Unsalvageable, I would draw it and every single game I played I pitched it to a drain and said to myself, what a waste.  If you want Power Pivot protection, throw in another Ghhhk.  Barrier and Ghhhk are my favorite protection and backup protection to anything the LS puts down in space offensively.<br />
<br />
BACKGROUND:<br />
I&#39;ve had a lot of requests to post updated versions of my top rated Dark deck, "SYCFA(UCK) MegaCon Undefeated 3rd Place".  Since I made it during v3, I slowly updated it by adding and switching cards for each V-Set, taking some out, and putting some back in.  This deck has had a lot of changes.  It was first inspired by Beseiged (V) and They Will Never Again Leave This City, but I quickly realized where the real strength of Big Blue is, not having to rely on gimmicky Effects and Interrupts to set up the deck.  The more power and forfeit you squeeze into the deck (ie: the more red cards you take out), the stronger the deck becomes.  The other thing I realized is that simply updating decks when V-Sets come out is really newbish.  The best way to do it is destroy your deck and start over.  So I did this after V-6, spread out all the cards from what was undoutedly the best original deck I ever made, and put them into different decks I was testing.  Then I sat down and thought about the philosophy of SYCFA(UCK).  If you read my first deck, you will know SYCFA(UCK) is all about two things.  Fast Fear damage and beating down the opponent in space.  If I had to break the deck down into phases of the game, I would say its strength is 10% early game, 70% midgame, 20% lategame.  So I thought about how I could make it last longer.  The past 2 sets have 2 cards that could make my deck last longer than Iron Mike Ditka on Levitra - Imperial Domination (V) and Ability, Ability, Ability (V).  I debated using Ability x3 for a long time and decided against it solely based on the fact that it kills Imperial Barrier, which is a staple to the deck (in fact I doubled the number of Barriers in the deck).  Imp Dom would take some work.  Sidious, U-3PO, Zuckuss in MH, Guri, Dengar in P1, and Keder would have to come out, which means my Falcon defense is gone.  So I changed the way I deal with the Falcon.  Barrier x4 and A Day Long Remembered (V) and an extra Imperial Command.  I was considering putting in Breached Defenses, but all that really accomplishes with the Falcon is limit it to one destiny which Command does anyway.  I took out DSWR, because I&#39;m sick of being drained there.  The extra system in the deck should make up for it.  The other thing that&#39;s changed is that immunity is cheap.  Vader (V) and Executor are more expensive than they&#39;re worth in this environment, so I dropped them in favor of more starships, since Imp Dom (V) is going to help me retrieve pilots like mad.  Much of the strategy remains the same, so I used the old one as a template, but keep reading and you&#39;ll find that this deck is leaner, meaner, and faster than ever.  And with QMC and HB as two of the top LS decks, this is a solid meta choice for many areas of the world.  Welcome to SYCFA(UCK) v2.0!<br />
<br />
Always remember to follow Rule Number One: <br />
Stick to your Gameplan. Read the article Old Father William by Michael Hawley and look under Game Day Mistakes #1 to see why this is a bad idea. This deck deals a lot of damage, and you can disrupt your opponent&#39;s strategy simply by forcing them to lose the cards they need to win. <br />
This setup works like a well oiled machine. Trust in your numbers. 5 Imp Commands, 1 Piett, 1 Praji (who pulls Merrejk), 1 Merrejk, 5 systems gives you great odds of getting everything out that you need.<br />
<br />
Pre-Game:<br />
Your Starting Effects:<br />
IAO/SP and YCHF/MP are staples.<br />
Your choices for #3:<br />
Imp Dom (V): for other space heavy decks that will put the fight to you like HB.<br />
Imp Decree (V): for decks that direct damage you like WHAP and Profit (you likely won&#39;t need this for TRM since you have good generation anyway)<br />
TINT/OE: for decks likely to use SAC like Combat and TRM<br />
No Escape: for decks likely to start <br />
You have 2 We Must Accelerate Our Planses (Gollum!  Gollum!) to grab anything you don&#39;t start.<br />
<br />
Turn 1: <br />
Grab Rendili or Carida.  Now it doesn&#39;t matter if the opponent pulls Do or Do Not on You.  If you have Imp Command, play it to get Piett. If you have Piett get Chiraneau vs a ground deck or keep it in hand vs a space deck. If Merrejk is in your starting hand, get Piett, but use him to pull the AO. Never grab an Admiral with Imp Command if opponent has grabber on table and 1 force active.  First turn always play Imp Command to get admirals out.  Get Chiraneu if you think you need to outdrain the opponent, Thrawn if you need to battle him, and Ozzel if you&#39;re not sure.  Sometimes you will get 2 systems in hand.  When you pull your third system with MP, you now have enough (except against a drain race matchup) that you don&#39;t need to rel yon Merrejk.  Do yourself a favor and grab Ozzel with that Imp Command.  Now there&#39;s a 0 out of your deck, he deploys free, and makes your ships deploy even cheaper.  <br />
<br />
Turn 2-3: <br />
Deploy a ship (unique if possible) with Piett (or other Admiral) onboard and grab Merrejk. If you have Merrejk grab Praji instead.  Get Chiraneau out as fast as possible if this is going to be a drain race. Make sure in the opening turns that Merrejk is protected until enough systems are out, then he is expendible. Protect Chiraneu all game with some forfeit fodder. Don&#39;t overdeploy your pilots. Look to get another ship + admiral to another system.  You cna also try to spread out early if you are confidant and have a good hand.  Non-uniques deploy -3 to unique SD locations, -1 with Piett, -1 with Ozzel, -2 with Admiral Motti (V).<br />
<br />
Turn 4-5: <br />
You&#39;ve been getting all your systems out on table with Merrejk (or you were lucky and drew them), and you&#39;ve been hitting the opponent for a lot of damage with FWKTIL and drains.  If you got Emperor at any point, you&#39;ve also not been paying for them.  If not, at this point it doesn&#39;t matter, because you&#39;re activating more than you need.  Remember that if you want opponent to lose force to FWKTIL and you control Nal Hutta or Courlag, move Death Star to parsec 1 (for Nal Hutta) or 2 (for Courlag).<br />
<br />
Q&A: <br />
HOW DO I BEAT SPACE? <br />
You can spread what appears to be thin in this deck and never take damage. A pilot + destroyer = 13 forfeit, 10 power at least, so your opponent has to come up with 23 power or more to damage you. If they deploy, Barrier or Command to limit their destiny.  You play 5 Commands and 4 Barriers.  They will have to grab one, and then you can abuse the other (most LS players will grab Command).  You can spread around the opponent&#39;s space deck while Barriering their ships and forcing them to come to you where you can fight them offensively rather than defensively.  Beatdown is easy.  Use the cheap Star Destroyers for power.  Deploy as much power as you can with enough forfeit fodder to last the offensive (1 or 2 guys).  Lateral Damage the biggest ship if necessary.  Drop ADLR(V) if they have immunity you don&#39;t think you can bust.  Your destiny isnt great, but its better than the previous version.  You shouldn&#39;t have to rely on destiny because of your huge power and immunity cancellers (as well as destiny adders Thrawn and Command), but if you need a good destiny, track ADLR (V) by deploying it and not paying its upkeep to send it to used.  When you battle, you should retrieve at least 1 or 2 Imperials.  This is HUGE!  The LS will have to be using Civ Dis and Bacta Tank and ALWAYS be on the offensive in order to keep up with you.  The best part about Imp Dom is if they initiate and YOU win, you can still retrieve 1 guy.  If you want him in your hand, track him and draw him for destiny, take him to hand to cause a redraw.  Move away after the battle and repeat.  You can use Praji to pull back the Imperials you retrieve.  This makes you last a LONG time against most space decks in a war of attrtion.  Keep putting the pressure on the opponent by Fearing and draining around them.<br />
<br />
HOW DO I OUTDRAIN THE GROUND? <br />
The previous version relied on Imperial Decree and UC spies.  Only 1 UC spy is Imp Dom compliant, so Arica is your only UC spy (you can start her vs Profit).  And yes, even though she&#39;s half alien, she works with Imp Dom, because Imp Dom only checks for the Imperial logo.  It doesn&#39;t care what else you have.  This version is much faster than v1.  You have more ships and systems to set you up faster and more barriers and commands to stop the typical LS space attack of HCF.  You should be able to win on sheer speed damage, but you also have Decree (V) to stop direct damage like WHAP, Profit, Rebel Artillery, and No Credits.<br />
<br />
SOME OTHER POINTS (RESPONSES TO COMMENTS ON SYCFAUCK v1):<br />
Low parsec systems: <br />
Yes it&#39;s nice to drain for 2 at Endor and the like, but a few problems. 1) So many decks play Strike Planning now that playing Endor is like giving your opponent a Twix (YOU GENERATE NO FORCE THERE!). 2) It isn&#39;t lazy to play low parsecs, it is smart. I would rather draw 6 cards than use 6 force to move my system to parsec 6 so that I can deal damage at Endor. Not to mention the fact that it takes 6 turns to do so. This deck is supposed to be setup by turn 4-5, so you&#39;re prolonging your damage. Very unwise. Trust me on this.  The systems also (with the exception of Kiffex) drain for 1 on your opponent&#39;s side too, so giving them up if you have to is no big deal. <br />
<br />
Anti-SAC: <br />
If you think the opponent is playing a lot of Alters, start TINT/OE and grab the first Alter they play.  This keeps them from using Alter more times than the number of copies they pack (usually 1 or 2, sometimes 3).  If you dont have one of the other 2 FWKTILs or 2 WMAOP, track the FWKTIL in your Used Pile until you get it back.<br />
<br />
Characters and Ships:<br />
You can change some of this stuff if you want.  I might switch DS-61-3 for Captain Godhert.  These guys don&#39;t matter a whole lot.  Just pick guys with decent forfeit and/or power.  I would say forfeit is more important, because you want the ship to survive a battle destiny draw of 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Low destiny "problem": <br />
Low destiny is never a problem in this deck, because you don&#39;t rely on it. Decks like Agents and WYS use low power and high destiny to achieve a high total power. You do the same by having high power and low destiny while limiting your opponent&#39;s destiny with Imp Command (which I have plenty of).  ADLR(V) can get around any immunity and can also be used to track.  Dom lets you redraw your destiny if you draw that pesky Ozzel.  Before they changed ADLR(V), I used 2 and I found that&#39;s all I needed to draw high destiny all the time.  Deploy it and let it go to Used at the end of your turn and count the cards in RD to track the 6.  Another easy way to track destiny is retrieve the Emperor with Imp Dom and count cards.<br />
<br />
Matchups: <br />
vs HB:<br />
Follow the gameplan described under HOW DO I BEAT SPACE? perfectly and you will win.  Spread out and damage early, before they flip.  Continue once they flip, and don&#39;t bother probing if your Fear damage is high enough.  Try to orchestrate a beatdown by drawing them into your low parsecs and using a good ol&#39; Lat Damage.  Draw a lot for your Command and Barriers.  Try to track them and figure out where they are in your Force Pile so you can draw them.<br />
<br />
vs TRM<br />
Follow the gameplan described under HOW DO I BEAT GROUND? perfectly and you will win.  You won&#39;t get to use YCHF/MP until you occupy a system, but with 5 in the deck, it shouldnt be hard.  Most TRM only packs HCF and Spiral.  Maybe Home One.  Lat Dmg the Home One equals game.<br />
<br />
vs Profit: <br />
Start Arica in the Chamber. Keep her away from anyone with a weapon.  You might want to start Decree (V) for Profit damage, which will be reduced to nothing most likely.  Drop Emp at the DB and pull Battle Plan.  If I Hope She&#39;s Alright comes down, get a character to the DSDB with Emperor. Use your spies wisely. You go first, so you usually win, but this is a tough matchup. Kill Landing Claw with Godhert (if you switch him in for DS-61-3 like I did) or Ghhhk/Those Rebels, which you should look for early if you suspect Landing Claw. If you cancel a Claw and they dont have Yoxgit, you win the game because Lat Damage and beatdown is 15-30 force loss. They get a chacne to move away, so they may go to Alderaan, but you can move someone over to force them out. They cannot hide forever. My record for a Lat Damage beatdown on a Landing Clawed ship is 48 battle damage. <br />
<br />
vs WYS: <br />
WYS will usually drop Dash on you early. This is funny, because Dash sucks when you Lat Damage him. You kill Dash early, and you win. WYS never plays HCF, and Capn Han sucks to Imperial Command. Play the beatdown game, and spread ocne you&#39;ve destroyed their fleet. If they combine Dash and Han together, Lat Damage Dash and play Imp Command.  You may also want a tracked destiny or ADLR(V).  If you dont have these cards yet, run and drain around them, draw until you do. Easy win unless they use weapons and Power Pivot. A Useless Gesture shield makes sure they play Power Pivot only once. Also watch out for Darklighter Spin, but play the power game.<br />
<br />
vs Speeders: <br />
Speed is the key.  If you are faster than they are, you win.  Drain early and you may hit a T47 off the deck.  If you take a T-47 Formation hit, you can still win as long as you keep the damage going.  Use Decree (V) if they use the Objective with direct damage.  You can also force them to lower the shield for your UC spy by controlling Hoth System and pulling CHYBC. Nothing to watch out for in space. Tough game if they are able to hit you with a T-47 Formation. Otherwise, you win easy.  Speeders play with a ton of cards on the table, so Objective reduction of your Fear damage shouldn&#39;t matter, because they can&#39;t handle the force drains.  Best part is Speeder decks usualy go looking for a beatdown to win the game.  Sorry, nothing to beatdown in this deck (except Empy at DSDB who is immune to attrtion and takes no battle damage).<br />
<br />
vs Senate: <br />
LS Senate has a weak space package, so dont worry much about it. Expect to see HCF. Just Imp Command that sheeit and kick its ass.  Spread out and treat as a ground deck.  Keep those Barriers and Commands in hand.  If Senate worries you, add Hyperwave Scan (V) as a possible 3rd starting effect.<br />
<br />
vs QMC: <br />
Stick to your plan. Spread out and drain. Try to arrange a beatdown to put you over the edge.  They generally drop Dash early.  Against one QMC I hit them second turn with a 10-15 overflow.  Try to cancel Celeb if you can, which shouldn&#39;t be too hard. This deck also has a lot on the table, so you shouldnt have to hit them for much to kill them. Watch out for (and consider grabbing) Alternatives to Fighting. Catch this card if they have Celeb, Luke, or Figrin out, so they cant retrieve it, then try for the beatdown again. You should be able to beat an opponent of your equal skill level in this matchup. <br />
<br />
vs RST: <br />
Drain them out. CHYBC works well early if they move into the Bunker and get below 2 BGs. Their space will probably suck. Tala 1 and 2 are fun to kill, especially if your opponent thinks they&#39;re clever by deploying them to Death Star for drain of 3 (note, read Evax&#39;s text for a fun trick when your opponent is at Death Star System. I&#39;ve never done this, but it might be a fun surprise).  Imp Decree (V) will help soften the blow if they blow the bunker on you.<br />
<br />
vs Operatives: <br />
Who plays these? Oh yeah, me. Pop out Leave Them To Me and get to their system. Control it, get Emp to the DSDB and pop Battle Order. If they play Bothawui, you get to damage them +2 for FWKTIL. <br />
<br />
vs RTP: <br />
Use CHYBC and/or Resistance to stop Leia&#39;s drains. Damage quick and early. Get your Imp Commands ready, because once they flip you have no immunity to attrition, but that&#39;s ok, because this deck was built under the assumption that your immunity gets cancelled a lot by DWTE(V).  Lack of immunity is basically what inspired me to redesign the deck.<br />
<br />
vs Combat:<br />
Your UC spy is worthless, so set up your Emperor at the DSDB in case they pull Battle Plan.  Keep Barriers and Imp Commands in hand for the Falcon.  Once Falcon is deployed, you don&#39;t have to kill it, just drain/Fear around it.  You need to pull Grabber shield and grab Alter.  It&#39;s up to you whether to start No Escape and pull OE shield or starting TINT/OE and draw for No Escape.  Usually against Combat it won&#39;t be hard to get 3 BGs to satisfy Honor.  You coould also try pulling Fanfare shield to stop them from sacking Insight to get Honor.  Draw a lot for FWKTILs.  As far as I know, you can deploy 2 on table at the same time (it&#39;s non-unique).  They are NOT cumulative, but if they Alter one during their turn, you still have one left to damage them with on yours.  I actually just thought of that while writing this, so I&#39;m going to have to try that against any deck that plays SAC.<br />
<br />
Anything else: <br />
STICK TO YOUR GAME PLAN. This deck has the drain potential of an Operatives deck with 5 times the ability to resist battle damage and twice the ability to smackdown on anything that comes its way. <br />
<br />
What to look out for: <br />
Ships with weapons can play interrupts to reduce your power to 0 or cancel your immunity to attrition.  Try to stay away from them.  I haven&#39;t seen this kind of deck in awhile though, so it&#39;s definately not something you&#39;re going to see in more than 90% of your games.  The X-Wing Cannon alone can&#39;t hurt your caps, just the Power Pivot and most decks don&#39;t pack that.<br />
<br />
I love this deck. It&#39;s my baby and has served me well in both Classic and Regular.  I will probably be retiring this deck from tournies for a little while, because there are a ton of decks I want to try out before I bring back ol&#39; SYCFA(UCK) again.<br />
