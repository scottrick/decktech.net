These are the locations you&#39;ll want to hold for the rest of the game, because it keeps your objective on the 7 side. Since Invasion is not played that much, let me remid you of the 7 side.<br />
<br />
- You lose no more than 2 Force to any Force drain. Very nice.<br />
- If you have two (Battle Droid icon) droids with different card titles (or a (Battle Droid icon) droid and a Neimoidian) in battle at a site, draw two battle destiny if unable to otherwise. That&#39;s the real trick, these hunks of junk can actually do something.<br />
- Your battle droids, i.e., almost all of your characters, are deploy -1. Nice, since activation is an issue.<br />
- Your droid starfighters are immune to attrition < 3. Pretty irrelevant.<br />
- If opponent just drew an Interrupt for battle destiny, once per battle you may place that card out of play. Nice, some direct damage, and ensures that high destiny interrupt is not drawn over and over again.<br />
<br />
Since your deck relies on these heavy bonuses, and you&#39;ll flip back if opponent controls the Naboo System or Throne Room, you&#39;ll really want to keep presence at these locations. So what are your options?<br />
<br />
Imperial Justice (V) is a very nice card, limiting both players to one unmodifiable battle destiny, <br />
keeping attrition against you at an acceptable level.<br />
 Of course, your objective gets around the one destiny limit with the phrase &quot;unable to otherwise&quot;. That&#39;s the kind of justice the Empire deals out, I guess.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s have a look at the system. With Daulty on the Flagship, it is immune to attrition < 9. So if you have cards on one of your Imperial Justice (V), attrition is a non-issue. Weapons or Dash&#39;s power reducing ability could hurt, though, but guess what? Daulty keeps care of that also, as long as your Theed <br />
Palace Admiral&#39;s Order is on table. That&#39;s why I play 4. Bright Hope cancelling destinies in the absence of Imperial Justice (V) can be handled with the Laser Cannon Batteries. Against dedicated space decks, you always have Maul who can cloak at the system for a loss of two Force (or one droid, see Forced Servitude).<br />
<br />
The throne room: here, the 2 battle destinies of your objective should really help. Combine this with the fact that opponent&#39;s cards&#39; immunity to attrition is reduced by 3 (At Last We Are Getting Results(V)), and nothing thrown at you should survive long. Nothing? What about complete immunity to attrition? Well, read 3B3-1204, he can cancel immunity to attrtition of a Jedi. Your droids go to the Droid Racks, from where you can fetch them for two Force (or one if TT-6 or TT-9 is on the table). They are also dirt cheap, so you should have no problem keeping something at the Throne Room. <br />
<br />
<br />
So now that you have these two locations, what do you do? Well, it depends. First of all, they are both drain two sites, so it is not unlikely<br />
 your opponent will come to you. If so, prepare for a nice interactive game. Keep your droids battling, place his interrupts out of play, and remember the reduced immunity.<br />
<br />
If they do not come, you have two more sites where you can drain for two at, for a total drain potential of 8. Sidious at the battle plains and two droids at the swamps is a common scenario. Add in the fact that drains against you are capped at two, and you can enter any drain race.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can also bring the battle to your opponent<br />
. Your droids are cheap everywhere, and they draw two battle destinies everywhere, and you do have two Ghhhks. Fire at will, commander! If you do attack Jedi, make sure to deploy Sidious somewhere first so you can poop them after cancelling their immunity with good old 3B3-1204.<br />
<br />
Always remember that with 3,720 To 1 and Nute Gunray, your droids are destiny +2 unless you use Imperial Justice (V). Also, Nothing Can Get Through Our Shields prevents your battle destinies at Naboo sites from being canceled. Your Objective cancels Civil Disorder, so don&#39;t let your opponent retrieve for battling you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
Cease Fire! really helps against lightsabers: for a force loss of two (or one droid, see Forced Servitude), you can prevent all weapons from being fired in a battle. It also cancels Blaster Proficiency.<br />
<br />
Stunning Leader is a nice backup for the Throne Room so you can pick your battles there. You don&#39;t have to overdeploy to the Throne Room with a Stunning Leader in hand.<br />
Remember, your droids (except leaders) are not excluded, so you can also use this offensively to beat on a &quot;lone&quot; Chewie or some other poor fellow.<br />
<br />
Forced Servitude: &quot;Deploy on an opponent&#39;s location. Whenever you lose a droid from hand or Life Force, it satisfies Force loss up to its forfeit value. Once per turn, you may play Imperial Code Cylinder to cancel a Force drain where you have a droid. Effect canceled if opponent controls this location.&quot; With So many droids, this is a must play. It gets pulles by Crossfire, and 3,720 To 1 (v) can redeploy it from Lost Pile, so you&#39;ll always have it around. It&#39;s nice to lure the opponent to deploy characters to his own twixes to cancel this effect just to deploy it again next turn.<br />
<br />
SSA-719: can put cards out of play after you verify opponent&#39;s deck. I once got rid of Amidala 1st turn this way against WHAP. It was pretty much game over afterwards.<br />
<br />
3B3-1204: Cancel a Jedi&#39;s Immunity. Very important, so I play two copies.<br />
<br />
Battle Droid Officer: further reduces the costs of infantry battle droids (the ones whose names start with 3B3), adds one to your total battle destiny, and your battle droids move to his site for free.<br />
<br />
Two Ghhhks? Getting a lone battle droid beaten up sucks. A Ghhhk helps.<br />
<br />
4 Admiral&#39;s Orders? They&#39;re needed against Weapons and the Outrider. Besides, with 4 AOs, even I can track.<br />
<br />
Take Them Away: get rid of undercover spies, and add one to battle destiny draws. Pulled by Nute.<br />
<br />
