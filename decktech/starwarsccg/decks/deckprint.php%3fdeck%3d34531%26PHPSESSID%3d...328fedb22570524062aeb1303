Well well well here it is and just as I thought adding the space package has diminished the interrupt and defensive capabilities.<br />
<br /><br />
But that’s to be expected  ok with the new strat you start with YCNHFE/MP, Special delivery (v) and Krayt Dragon Bones (v).<br />
<br /><br />
The idea is to pull Carida and then drop the YCNHFE/MP to pull Combat Response and then go to space if required.<br />
<br /><br />
Yes i am aware there is only 2 star ships to pull but i feal that Bob Hunter with Combat Response is a reliable way to deploy Bob to a docking bay and Fight when needed most it kinda makes sense Jabbas Influance cant pull Bounty hunters so i look at it as another method to pulling Bobafet the main man.<br />
<b<br />
Krayt Dragon Bone’s (v) gives you the scare factor and adds 2 cards to your 60<br />
<br /><br />
Try and get Gailid and despair (v) in play to maximise your drains at the AC.<br />
<br <br />
Yes SAC can hurt but thats why we have shields graber and there is no try shield own plus you retrieve lots.<br />
<br <br />
He’s all yours Bounty Hunter (v) will get the Prize to the AC in 1 Turn provided you have all the requierd sites in play alternativly it is great with any Bounty Hunter with Gun adding +2 to your weapon destiny draw (IG-88 oh Year).<br />
<br /><br />
With special delivery (v) deploy No Escape from reserve and retrieve top lost pile card INTO HAND! and then wait till a battle is initiated and play Sacrifice (v) and target your No Escape draw Destiny less then the target destiny number then place No Escape in your used pile to activate that amount and repeat this same process next turn.this is a garinteed way to retrieve the top card from lost pile  every turn and it works beautifly.<br />
<br />
Barrier and None shall pass and Ghhhk and Hutt Bounty will give your characters lots of protection at your battle grounds and with Scum and Viliany plus your other retrievel methods the alien engine battles on and on and on.<br />
<br /<br />
Rancor Bubbo and Malakili (v) combo is totally leathal and more oftern then not your opponent will stay clear of your Docking bays because of the munch factor bubbo is great at the AC.<br />
<<br />
 Xizor and Jabba can all utualise the Hutt Bounty (v) Text and make opponents character at same site becomes power 0??????? This RAPES light side mains.<br />
<b<br />
Nizuc Bec (v) And Juri Juice will cancel any Force drain and the game text and ability of any alien targeted.<br />
<b<br />
There is much more but this is the main focus of the deck and yes the nombers are low but that’s because I am running the No escape + Sacrifice (v) tech and with lando (v) it allways works and carnt be stoped.<br />
