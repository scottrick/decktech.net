<br />
V14 EDIT: Replace the old Gunners with the Death Star Gunner (V). This new addition offers a few subtle differences. Mainly, it helps you get the Superlaser out on the first turn. The new gunners now make your Strategic Reserves all the more effective. You can now deploy them from Strategic Reserves to the Death Star, without fear of a beatdown, even after you flip your objective. In this case, I might also remove Emergency Deployment in favor of something else. The new Admiral&#39;s Order also might be worth considering, but it is not a classic card.<br />
<br />
<br />
To start, Prepared Defenses to deploy A Million Voices, Endor Shield, and Kuat Drive Yards. Begin the text of Set Your Course to get the cards you need to blow up Alderaan. Your first priority is to get the Superlaser, and then begin moving the Death Star toward parsec 2.<br />

Meanwhile, use Kuat Drive Yards to pull your systems: Endor first, then Fondor, then Kessel. With all of the locations deployed, you generate 14 Force and only give up 4 icons to your opponent (only 3 after the destruction of Alderaan). Use Endor Shield to pull your Admirals. Chiraneau is your most important character, but all of them are pretty useful. With Imperial Commands, you can get even more Admirals out of the deck. Pulling these cards will also improve your average destiny.<br />
<br />
You need a total destiny of 9 to blow up Alderaan. Each site adds 1 to the total, and each Gunner adds 2 to the total. The best way to destroy it is with all 3 gunners and all 3 sites, which makes it automatic. Even if the opponent occupies one Death Star site, you&#39;ll only need a destiny of 1 to complete it. The Deflector Shield Generators can really help to increase the destiny of all of your starships.<br />
<br />
After you flip, send your gunners to the Used Pile. Its time to deploy your starfleet, retrieve your Lost Pile, and drain the opponent to death. Retrieve 3 Force each time you deploy a Star Destroyer. Control your 3 battleground systems, and you can drain for 10 each turn, or 13 with Chiraneau out. You can also drain at the Docking Bay with Vader and Mara, which you opponent can easily forget. Be smart in space and on the ground and avoid overflow. If the opponent deploys anywhere in space, then you can outlast them with your starships and your retrieval.<br />
<br />
Individual Card Choices:<br />
<br />
Four Gunners?: The Gunners are too important. Three is not enough. With Four, you increase the odds that they will be deployed early, when you need them. Also, sometimes a gunner can be killed either by a battle or by a failed Commence. There are several ways you can retrieve them, too. Gunners also work for Strategic Reserves.<br />
<br />
Strategic Reserves: Cancel a Force drain by placing a Death Star Gunner here from hand. Early on, you can cancel drains and then send your Gunners to the Used pile. After you flip, the Death Star is no longer safe, but you can still deploy them as passengers and then forfeit them and repeat.<br />
<br />
Control: Cancel early Force drains, then retrieve your Controls, then use them again to cancel later Force drains.<br />
<br />
First Strike and Imperial Domination: Deploy a Star Destroyer at any system (retrieve 3), initiate battle (retrieve 1, opponent loses 1, retrieve an Imperial). Forfeit your Star Destroyer (with Ghhhk if necessary) and then repeat. Vader and Mara can also go on suicide missions if your opponent invades the Death Star early and tries to kill your gunners, so why not keep retrieving?<br />
<br />
Admrial Ozzel, Admiral Piett, Admiral Motti: All of these characters can use the Imperial Command gametext to add destiny or limit your opponent&#39;s destiny. Their biggest advantage, though, comes through the deployment modifiers. Piett and Ozzel both subtract 1 from the cost of your Star Destroyers, and Motti subtracts 2. In conjunction with other deployment modifiers, you can sometimes deploy Star Destroyers for as little as 1 or 2 Force. <br />
<br />
Death Star Assault Squadron: Your only protection against Attack Runs. It&#39;s pretty powerful on its own, though, and you can also pull it with Set Your Course and retrieve it with the next card.<br />
<br />
Put All Sections on Alert: Retrieve two gunners (or the Assault Squadron) into hand and get them back for your Strategic Reserves. Then, retrieve the destiny 6 back into your deck and track it when you deploy your next Star Destroyer. It can also help you out in battles on the Death Star. It might be worth it to include two of these.<br />
<br />
Imperial Reinforcements (V): This card can really help you early on or late in the game. Retrieve a bunch of starships.<br />
<br />
Return To Base: A great way to keep your starships recycling back onto the table. With all of the deployment modifiers, your costs are pretty low, so you usually have enough Force to get a ship back with Return to Base, and then retrieve again.<br />
<br />
We&#39;re In Attack Position Now: Replace any of your opponent&#39;s annoying Admiral&#39;s Orders. All of your Admirals deploy -2. Increases the immunity of your starships, to keep your Admirals alive.<br />
<br />
Endor: Your opponent activates no Force here. You drain for 2, and they drain for 1. Their deploy cost and movement cost is +1 to Endor.<br />
<br />
Fondor: You activate 2, but your opponent can only drain for 1. The Executor deploys for only 10 here. It increases the deploy cost (+1) and decreases the forfeit of Corvettes (-4).<br />
<br />
Kessel: Opponent requires ability of 6 to draw battle destiny. Your starships deploy minus 1 here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cards that I wish I could fit:<br />
<br />
A Day Long Remembered (V): Activate all of your Force, deploy it, then recycle a 6 back in your deck for Commence against Alderaan (or Hoth), and the opponent cannot grab it or cancel it in any way. <br />
<br />
Accuser (Another one): Deploy it as a react, retrieve 3, forfeit it, deploy it again, retrieve 3 again ... You get the point.<br />
<br />
Sniper & Dark Strike: Because it&#39;s a classic deck that uses Sudden Impact, your permanent lightsabers aren&#39;t as effective as they could be. Dark Strike can send them to the Lost Pile in the middle of a battle. You can also use Sniper with the Superlaser to eliminate Tantive IV or any annoying capital ship.<br />
<br />
Mobilization Points: The extra activation is not that important, but the ability to pull the Executor is key. Ideally, I would like to deploy the Executor to Fondor early and load it up with my Admirals and a Deflector Shield Generator.<br />
<br />
Oppressive Enforcement (Effect not Shield): A few cards are vulnerable to Sense and Alter, so of course it helps there. Adding 1 to the destiny of each capital starship would help in a number of ways.<br />
<br />
Ability, Ability, Ability: Usually, your retrieval allows you to outlast the opponent late in the game. Classic AAA can speed up the loss to your opponent and help you win a drain race.<br />
<br />
Imperial Propaganda (V): Reduce an early loss by 2 and reduce all subsequent direct damage.<br />
<br />
Grabbers: There are a lot of annoying interrupts that can hurt you in space. All Wings / Darklighter Spin is the worst.<br />
<br />
Lando Calrissian (V): He&#39;s a great pilot, and his destiny modifying gametext is phenomenal, whether for blowing up Alderaan, or for any other purpose.<br />
<br />
Grand Moff Tarkin: Cancel a destiny with Vader (or the Assault Squadron) if you need it. Subtract another 1 from deploy costs at Kessel.<br />
<br />
Darth Vader (V): He&#39;s a beast in space, and he&#39;s not half-bad on the ground either.<br />
<br />
More Death Star sites: This deck is pretty vulnerable against Local Uprising (V), and your opponent can make it nearly impossible to blow away Hoth if they deploy all of their Hoth sites. If you fear Local Uprising, then add 3 more sites.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed: As long as your deploying these starships, why not send a few starships like Dash and the Falcon to the Used Pile.<br />
<br />
<br />

Tusken84: I really do like the title of this! I probably would change some cards, but overall it looks like a fun deck that can win some. Good work!<br />
<br />
Response: It feels very strange to retrieve Force by deploying Star Destroyers, especially when you use a Star Destroyer to retrieve other Star Destroyers. It feels even stranger when you use Return to Base. The title is very fitting. (Even though Threepio is not nearly as funny in the prequels, Star Wars is still Star Wars.) Im not sure if this deck can win, but it is definitely fun to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
Staffpmc: Looks fun - don&#39;t forget you can also pick a fight with a Deathstar Gunner - retrieve with Imperial Domination (v) and First Strike (plus Ability, Ability, Ability (v) which I would add in ;) and then send him to your used pile during the weapons segment! <br />
<br />
Response: It would be awesome to combo with AAA (V) as well. That Effect cannot retrieve your permanent weapon characters, but it works regardless of how many locations you occupy. It was a bit of a tossup, and its hard to get both of those Effects out in addition to First Strike. Individual card choices are always difficult and personal, but the core of this deck is pretty fun regardless. Ive tried different versions, some with Fear Will Keep Them In Line (V), some with Tractor Beams and some with TIE squadrons and SFS, and this version is my favorite so far.<br />
<br />
I think that the Light Side Rebel Tech (V) can go to the Used pile at any time during the Light Side turn, from anywhere, but you can only ditch a Death Star Gunner during the control phase and on the Death Star. Actually, Im not sure why people dont use the Rebel Tech more often. If Im not mistaken, you can use a Rebel Tech with Draw Their Fire and Civil Disorder (V) every turn. You can also keep canceling Force drains with Entrenchment each turn. Im sure people would get really pissed, though, so maybe its illegal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow13: replace kuat drive yards V with cmdr merrejk, addrfear will keep them in line and use systems at parsec 2-4. instantly better deck.<br />
<br />
Resoponse: I think you are correct. Fear Will Keep Them in Line (V) would make the deck stronger. The deck would also be instantly better if I never try to flip Set Your Course in the first place, and just do the non-flip version. If I wanted an instantly better deck, I could just copy Brian Hunters SYCFA Fear deck. The problem with CPI has always been that it requires too many cards to pull off and the advantages are not all that great. There is a reason why CPI never took off as a popular deck, even in Classic format. The goal here was not to make the strongest possible deck, but a deck that is a lot of fun to play. As a result, I focused on blowing up planets, the retrieval engine, and cheap deployment. Use your own judgment for individual card choices, but the core principles of the deck are the fun part.<br />
<br />
Merrejek vs. Kuat Drive Yards offers an interesting debate, though. If you scrap Kuat, you can start a different effect (probably Strikeforce), which can help in its own ways. Unlike a Death Star Gunner, you cannot send Merrejek to the Used Pile after you flip: if Merrejek stays on the Death Star, he is vulnerable to a battle over the remainder of the game. You can try to put him out in space, but that would mean that you would need the Force to get a Star Destroyer down early, and it is tougher to activate until you have pulled the system. Even if you pulled it off, you would be deploying your Star Destroyers before the flip (i.e.- no retrieval), and Merrejek would have no immunity and could not use Command (unless he was with an admiral). If you pulled Merrejek with Endor Shield, you would also be sacrificing one of your twice per game admiral pulls. Paying the 2 Force over the first three turns to deploy a system is not a problem usually, and you can start it immediately. The gametext on the Endor, Fondor, and Kessel systems are all phenomenal (in addition to their superior activation stats), while the gametext on the parsec 1 through 4 systems rarely help you win. Kuat Drive Yards not only lets you pull your systems, but it also makes all your Star Destroyers deploy -1, immune to attrition less than 4 (which becomes less than 6 with a pilot and your Admirals Order), and ability +2. All of these factors make a difference.With Kuat out, a lot of your ICSDs will draw battle destiny on their own, which makes them more versatile and more efficient.<br />
<br />
Even with all of these reasons, though, I still agree with you, in that the Fear (V) version of this deck would probably be stronger. You cant really argue with a card that says opponent loses 2 Force. I have more fun starting with Kuat Drive Yards (V), though, because it suits my style. <br />
<br />

HanSolo: "This deck looks good and fun. V14 has probably helped you out quite a bit. Cool tech against attack runs with the Death Star Assault Squadron, that card almost never gets played. Only one thing I can complain about here, I would go with the control combo, it&#39;s one destiny lower, but you can also use it to send the opponent&#39;s pilots (aka Dash) back to hand and then beat the snot out of them."<br />
<br />
Response: The Control / Set For Stun combo is definitely worth considering. Destiny is definitely an issue in this deck, and I could use all the help I can get. For CPI, the difference between 1 and 2 can actually be pretty huge. It&#39;s certainly a tradeoff, and I could go either way on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The E-Man: "Excellent."<br />
<br />
Response: Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jabba the Ruck: "You might want to consider putting in Maneuver Check (v) so that you can target a planet OTHER than Yavin 4 once you flip. It should be easy if you have all 3 Gunners out, and just pile up all your ships on the planet to force the LS to move away letting you just BLOW UP the entire LS strategy. Also, make sure you have the Coward Shield out like every game to prevent them from draining you on the DStar locations (unless Tantive IV (v) is out at the system). Kuat (v) might be better if you go this way with the deck since you just take away their strategy since it makes your destroyers cheaper & gives them Immunity to Attrition. Hope that helps, thanks for posting, always nice to see new ideas!"<br />
<br />
Response: Maneuver Check (V) is a great idea. Honestly, I didn&#39;t even realize there was a virtual card with that function. It&#39;s such a great card, that it might be worth rethinking my entire strategy. If I&#39;m already devoting this many cards to CPI, I might as well include one more that will allow me to blow away Dantooine, Tatooine, Bespin, or even Dagobah. Dantooine, in particular, is a sitting duck (seems fitting with ANH, doesn&#39;t it). If you go that route, it might also be worth it to include a copy of the Tatooine system to help against Profit or Obi-Wan decks. You could also use Maneuver Check just to blow away an annoying big drain system, such as Kessel or Coruscant. <br />
<br />
Correct me if I&#39;m mistaken, but I believe that Maneuver Check prevents the opponent from moving into the Death Star Trench for another turn as well, which could slow down any Attack Runs that use spies or the Tantive IV.<br />
<br />
<br />
0037: "Looks fun to play. Gotta give props anytime someone blows up s@#$"<br />
<br />
Response: It is damn fun to play, and it is always very satisfying to blow a system away. You can do your best Peter Cushing impersonation with a British accent the whole game. I also recommend doing a Veer impersonation any time you play Target the Main Generator. Either way, it doubles the fun factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow 40: "Fun will always be fun. Nice try at a flipping SYCFA!"<br />
