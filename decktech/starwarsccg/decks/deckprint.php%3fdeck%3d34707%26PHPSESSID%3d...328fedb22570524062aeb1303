At any rate at Ohio states this past weekend the deck went 3 and 0 with wins of 37, 30 and 35, 102 differential in three games, slaughtering scum, senate and build the death star, which for some reason seemed to be the deck of the day after its fairly good showing at Maryland. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I know there are a lot of nay sayers out there, and a lot of them are probably going to rate this deck, but ill tell you straight up, this deck does not lose very often, and when it wins, it wins big. Also contrary to popular belief, this deck slaughters scum, hands down every time. Those that have seen it first hand can testify for it, its 3 and 0 against scum in tournament play, and has won all the games in pickup play, either against team Ohio Jquail scum, or pistons version, which I played about 10 cards different at Ohio states to go 6 and 0, 12 +177. Another misconception with people seems to be the lack of strategy the deck takes to play, im not going to deny its an NPE, and it might even be ‘broken’ in the hands of a good player, 5 and 1 with the loss coming to Greg Shaw in Major play is pretty close I would say, and yes in some matchups it does play itself, but with the more interactive matchups the player really has to pay attention to the game to come out on top, your not just playing yourself at that point, and ill get into that part of it a bit later.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
---Edit--- In responce to "decktech" being a moron, so much so that i decided to delete what he wrote in the ratings, i wanted to add a few things.<br />
1. DO not under any circumstance play with the Catina or B monks, or Tessek for that matter. You dont want to drain for 4, Ever. Period. All it takes is someone packing a single counter card to totally negate the deck. Cane Adis (v) will rape you to all hell if you drain for 4. Yes you can get drains of 4 with the deck, hell it isnt that hard to drain for 5 at 3 or more sites. But there isnt any reason to do so. 3 at 4+ sites is plenty fast enough, no reason to go higher and risk the game beacuse you wanted to pack cards to drain for more.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
First of all ill get into some of the card choices. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. No counter cards? That’s right, it doesn’t need them. In matchups where you generally need counters, you play speed style, which ill also get into later, senate, walkers and so on. Your not playing to try and counter what they are doing, they need to interrupt you to win the game, do your thing with the speed. The only counters I have really considered for the deck, and which have been in and out in casual play over the last month or so have been OOC/TT for HD which is its hardest match up and Sabotage (v) for getting rid of a few annoying weapons, tie cannons, laser cannons and Dr Es gun, most of which you really don’t need to prepare for, but they can be annoying in certain games.<br />
<br /><br />
2. 2 copies of everything you need to get going? Very important. A first turn setup can be a game winner against setups where its going to take speed to win the game, and its very helpful to not have to piddle around and wait to set everything up. A first turn flip and 5 species on the table is very very possible against some matchups. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. Space package. I have seen versions running the other Indy ships, but I just don’t see them as needed. There are really only a few decks that you are going to need the space against, Fear, capital senate and any other KDY (v) deck, where you can satisfy Battle plan/order with Lando in Falcon and just run away from battles. Stack an alien or two for forfeit and go. I would use HCF, but it suspends half the cards in the deck, so its pretty pointless. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any other choices you have questions about D-mail me. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In general before I get into the matchups there are a few  very important  things to remember when playing the deck.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. Don’t forget what your cards do. There are a lot of (v) cards in the deck, know what they do by heart. Don’t mean to pick on Drew Scott here, but im going to, in the final match up in Maryland he should have won the game by 20+, read the cards!<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. If you think they have Darth Maul, Don’t setup in the Ail you have an ability 4 alien.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. Bo Shuda is always last, don’t play like a champ and pull it first, then your other two effects cant deploy. Also if your going for a first turn flip, don’t pull it until you flip since it will make the AC a non battle ground.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4. Don’t forget what your cards do, and oh yeah, don’t forget what your cards do. They are busted, use them.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Onto the matchups:<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Scum: <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ill get into this one first since there are so many misconceptions about this, ask people I have played against with AITC. <br />
<br /><br />
Early game: Setup Yerka and TBM under Bo Shuda at the AC, more than likely you will be able to flip first turn, leslomy to the AC, pull a musician to one of the other sites, kitonak to the desert works well, and if you have any other alien in your hand deploy it to the third site to flip, then move the third alien to Kitonaks site, turn over. Turn two setup Ellors with a few other aliens at the AC, and pull a site, the best two to use here are Oola, pulled with Uh-Oh and Loje, who is huge (no mosep and galid for them, yay) both go to the AC and sit, more than likely you have 5-6 species on the table at this point, 3 and one site and 3 at the AC. Now sit and wait for them to do something. Work on getting out a Gift and All my urchins, while setting up your hand with a ton of random scrubs.  They cant beat you down, your aliens forfeit for a ton, and you can ignore 7 battle damage. Setup a Gift as soon as possible and move him away from the AC so they cant Smooch him and sit at the AC where you cant get him back. When a Gift is in effect your pretty much auto win against Pistones version if they cant get it canceled quickly, all their battle destinies are –3 overall and there is one site where they can drain for 1. and on the regular MKOS deck, their destines are still minus 1 overall, and your characters are just more recyclable.  Loje cancels Galids game text, did I mention how huge that is. Now that you are sitting there waiting for them to do something, if they try and play the drain race with you, fine. Setup musicians at a few different sites and retrieve like a champ. If they want to battle you, fine. Eventually it gets to a point in every game against scum where they have a bunch of aliens on the table, all of which are unique so they cant battle unless you want to, and its easy to win the drain race at that point. Most games you actually finish with Zero lost pile against scum because they get to a point where they have nothing left to come after you with, granted they retrieve a lot, but you retrieve more, your characters are more recyclable and your destines are just straight up better. This isn’t a lie folks, I didn’t play against scrubs, we actually tried to come up with a scum deck that beats AITC, and it just doesn’t seem to come together very well without dedicating 5-10 cards to doing so, and even then its questionable at best. Try it for yourself, test this AITC against the version pistone put up and the J’Quail  Team Ohio version, which blows the Greedo version out of the water, it does not lose the match up, ever. If you have questions D-mail me, just please don’t rate 1 star because you haven’t seen AITC in the hands of a good player. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Black Sun: <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Looking at pretty much the same type of deck as scum, setup earlier. A gift is even bigger in this match up since they don’t have hutt bounty. KFC can be a game breaker in this match up as well because they add attrition to every battle, but if you cancel their destiny they don’t get the bonus. This game really tends to be longer than against standard scum because of the attrition, but once you get All My urchins rolling, the game is pretty much yours, just cycle characters and retrieve. IMO black sun is watered down scum and the match up plays nearly identical. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Senate:<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They always give you 3+ force on your first turn. Use it, your activating 9+ on your first turn, and in this match up your going for speed, flip on the first turn and get Ellors rolling ASAP. The big bonus to this match up is that they play a very limited ground package, usually a few vaders and mauls plus maybe a dark Jedi or two to round it out, but at any rate, it isn’t really much of a threat, spread out fairly thin and roll. Your really playing for speed in this match up, its very possible to setup Ultimatum on your first turn, and keep it in effect for the entire game, really putting a hamper on their drains. If they decide to play w/ matching pilots, wait for them to go down with an alien in space, then setup A gift to further limit their drains. Overall this is one of the easier matchups for the deck, I am not saying there are no ground based senate decks out there that could be trouble, I just haven’t seen one that even comes to something remotely good as of yet.  If they play the KDY version of it, keep them off the ground as best you can and let Lando in falcon loose up in space, but don’t use him as an offensive card, just run and satisfy battle plan and drain him out. Oola can be a monster in this match up as well.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Walkers:<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Similar to senate, but you know they are going to be playing BH ships w/ pilots, or at least the good versions are further helping a Gift. Im not really sure if you have to worry about seeing Walkers at a Major anymore, but ill get into it anyway. As I said before, its similar to senate, setup as quickly as possible and drain. Draw until you find Tawas Khaa so your drains aren’t capped by Imp Decree. They will blow away the shields on your, but it isn’t much of a problem, just don’t over deploy early. Let them blow it away then retrieve it back by deploying and with Uh Oh. At any rate, Loje is huge again if your cant find Lando in falcon to go to Rendilli which they will more than likely put out since he basically lets you drain for 2, and you will win the drain race in this match up. This is one I really question when people say they lost to walkers with AITC. Yeah they have direct damage and some drains, but once you cap their drains w/ ultimatum, your draining for so much more and retrieving a ton every turn. On a normal turn when they don’t play Garrison, generally the AITC player can retrieve more damage then walkers do.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
HDADTJ:<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hardest match up for the deck by far. Main reason behind this is the massive character elimination that they come up with. If you can find Kor Slug earlier, its huge, but if you have to wait on it, Choke Vader can really put a hampering on your game. Granted Greg Shaw is the only person it beat this deck in Tournament play with HD, or any deck for that matter, but its still a tough matchup against some versions of HD. The best thing that I found to do against HD is to change up the start somewhat, instead of going with the Antechamber as your start, start JP. This way if you happen to get a sandwhirl in your hand and they went down with vader first turn, you get a huge advantage. The best advice I can give for this game is as follows. Try and cancel visage early and often with your Tanus or Jar Jar, setup Ellors quickly by putting 5 species in the AC, one has to be Oola. Sandwhirl is huge. And play the deck offensively. If the DS player sits vader alone at a site, or with some other low forfeit guy, go battle and track a 5 with 3po, or try your best to do so, a 5 turns into a 7 and you bust vaders immunity. In this game your pretty much looking at whittling their characters down as much as possible. Your going take take your lumps earlier from quick drains and visage, but you should be able to survive long enough to dish out some punishment towards the end of the game. I will say however, that it totally depends on what kind of HD they are playing as to how the match up goes. If they are playing the 5 choke vader, AAA blaster rack start, aka Greg Shaw, its going to be a hard game if you cant get Kor Slug early, hard game but winnable, if it isn’t that version its amazing how much easier the game gets because they cant cycle characters anywhere close to as well. Personally that was the first time that I had played a version like Greg had in tournament play and I played it wrong, if you find yourself playing a similar version, don’t go for drains early. Use your aliens offensively and make sure you kill them off in the battle, usually one can cover for around 20 or so, so don’t worry about throwing a 1/1 at vader. This way they cant keep using AAA to get cards back and eventually you will whittle them away. Then setup for the drains late game. If your really worried about HD I would change the package a little bit to include another All My Urchins and Kor Slug, as they are more important in that match than anything else. <br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
That’s pretty much it on the matchups IMO, nothing else I can think of really changes the way that you go about playing. If you think its going to be interactive, play like I wrote for the HD and Scum matchups. If its going to come down to drains, your have the speed to take care of it. That’s the main reason why I chose the deck over TRM for both tournaments, its so versatile , you want to play the drain race, fine, you want to battle fine.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Broken? I don’t know, it probably isn’t, but it might be the closest thing that we have to it right now, and in certain matchups yes it is a NPE, but I think that its record stands for itself. 5 and 1 in tournament play, all wins were huge. 3 and 0 in Ohio states with a +102 differential in three games, +30, +37, +35, 6 and 0 +177 overall, tournament report coming soonish. At any rate, some bullets are coming for it so well see how it can do post V9.<br />
