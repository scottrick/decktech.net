***********Update************** <br />
As Kinslayer44 so greatly pointed out. I am playing with the wrong chose for Chewie in this deck. Chewie, Protector completely makes the deck that much stronger by having a defense to both Dengar with Gun and Jabba the Hutt (V). <br />
<br />
In my defense, I changed this deck twice before I even got to Origins, and I just didn&#39;t think about playing with ANY type of Chewie I wanted to because he is ALWAYS free on the AT-ST. <br />
<br />
<br />
******ANOTHER UPDATE*********** <br />
<br />
Some new changes!!! With the increase of players playing with vehicles with WYS (V). You will need to add protection from Set for Stun. The deck now requires the following cards. <br />
<br />
Inconsequential Barrier x2 <br />
Rebel Barrier x2 <br />
Free Ride Combo <br />
<br />
<br />
The Following Cards were dropped: <br />
<br />
We Wish to Board at Once <br />
Moving Into Attack Position <br />
Civil Disorder (V) <br />
Out of Commission Combo <br />
A Few Maneuvers <br />
<br />
<br />
The reason for these changes is because the deck is very solid in space, but needs to have more protection on the ground. The Inconsequentials saved me from both Set for Stun on Chewie and Imperial Barrier. So they are a must. <br />
<br />
The other two cards types are because I found that having Barrier was MUCH stronger than playing with Civil Disorder (V), and direct damage from Occupation cards can mean the difference in a close game so the Free Ride Combo had to go in to cancel it. <br />
<br />
I chose to drop one A Few Maneuvers and one Out of Commission Combo because most of the time I never needed them to win the game. These new cards will allow for a much stronger defense to both the ground and space. If you believe a different card should be taking out in place of those cards, please feel free to change them. <br />
<br />
******************************************************** <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the deck that went 4-0 at Origins 2005 in the Nationals Tournament. The same deck only minus the Cannons also went 3-0 in the V Card Expansion Tournament the day before. So since I have been playing WYS (V), I have yet to lose a game. If you look, I have already posted a WYS (V) deck that mainly worked on the ground hiding under the high deployment. This deck is very different than that. It is mainly a space based deck, which flips first turn almost every game, and waits for the opponent to deploy in space. <br />
<br />
I have to give props to Jared Lockwood for the idea to use Quad Laser Cannons. They are truly awesome because if you read their lore you will see that they are Blasters, so by playing them. You will get the +2 bonus with Corellian Eng Corp and another +3 if you play Sorry About the Mess Combo used to add 3 to a blaster. The cannons can hit Capitals with no bonus and Starfighters with a +1 bonus. So if you are going after Mist Hunter (V), with the combo, you will have a base of 6 before they even have a chance to minus the draw for 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I will break down the deck. WYS (V) is a great objective that can be built so many different ways and still win. But, I believe this version to be one of the strongest and safest of all the different versions. Allow me to explain. <br />
<br />
The Set Up: <br />
<br />
The deck is built to set up and flip first turn, but it will all depend on your opening hand. In 80% of the games you would play with it, you will get either a Chewbacca (V) or his AT-ST (V) in your opening hand. I also find it very easy to get one of the No Questions Asked (V) in my hand. So, that leaves only the two sites to pull, one during their first turn, and one during yours. If you do pull one of the two Chewies or AT-STs, then you want to flash it and deploy it to the Swamp. Most of the time, you will also have no problem getting Laudica (V) out of your Reserve with Bargaining Table (V). Only in one game was she not there, so she goes down at the other site. BAM, you flip and then move her over to join Chewie in the AT-ST, completely protected from any weapon or capture. If you fear SAC at all, always pull both Wise Advice and Do or Do Not shields because all of your Effects and Interrupts are important and need to stay in your deck. <br />
<br />
After that, the rest of the game is easy. You just drain for three, and read what the darkside is up to. If you can see that it is mainly a ground based deck, get out Kessel and use Laudica (V) to pull Squadron Assignments to flash the Falcon and put Captain Han on it with any one of the many many pilots in the deck. The best combo would be to add Leia with Gun, so you can get 3 destinies, but it doesnt really matter. If you can see that the deck is a strong space deck. Then you may want to throw out one of the lightsaber characters, mainly Mace (V) to the Jungle by himself. Only against Scum would you not want to do this. On your planet, you will be greatly protected from being beaten down unless they can get out Security Precautions (V), but if you already have a guy at both sites, they will have to play a high amount before they can put the SP (V). In over 85% of the games I have played against. The darkside will NOT come to the ground on Corellia. The deployment is just too scary. So many games, the darkside will just set up their own strategy and try and beat you by either drains or battles in space, which you will have the advantage with NQA (V). You don&#39;t have to go to them on the ground. EVER!! Entrenchemnt (V) will greatly limit the amount of damage they are able to do against you, so why go after them. Many times, I have almost lost with this deck because I have tried to attack them on their sites, but you don&#39;t need to do that with this deck. If you just stay in space and only deploy ground forces to Corellia, you will win almost every time. <br />
<br />
Thats pretty much it. The deck is really really easy to play, and very hard to beat. Let me breakdown some of the card chooses so you will know why I have them in here. <br />
<br />
<br />
No Questions Asked x3  There are 3 of them because they are THE most important card in the deck. Your whole strategy revolves around this card. That is why there has to be many of them so you not only have a good chance of getting one in your opening hand, but you will be able to get another one fast to replace the darkside Admirals Order if they should deploy one. Plus, its always good to have a 6 destiny running around in your deck. <br />
<br />
Chewies AT-ST  I believe in playing with vehicles over any other form of protection, because it really does cut down on card slots by not having to play with Kor Slug (V) or the cards that pull it, as well as completely prevent them from hitting anyone. The only card they have is Set for Stun, which in itself, is not always easy to use. I choose Chewies because he is the cheapest vehicle deployment of any in the game that has any kind of power. Rogue 3 with A New Hope Wedge would be my only other option, and it doesnt have a built in Trample. I chose the match way over only play with the vehicles themselves, because it makes it easier to get in my opening hand and set up. If I only had the vehicles, I would have to either get the two characters in my hand or use up more card slots to pull characters and then find the vehicles. This way work the BEST!! <br />
<br />
Entrenchment (V)  This card is awesome in this deck. It needs to be in every version because it will literally slow down the darkside from any kind of hurtful damage. This card combined with your retrieval will provide you an almost auto victory. <br />
<br />
Mace (V)  He is a super solid character who is great to put on the ground at Corellia. He works well with the objective too allowing me to auto retrieve 2 force every time I battle with him. Even if I have already hit a character, I can still swing again and retrieve because that is all the objective requires. Before I get any more ratings about why he is in here, I designed Jedi Lightsaber (V), so for the rest of my life. I will always play with it in my light deck. So that is the real reason that I put Mace in a WYS (V) deck. <br />
<br />
Corellian Corvette  Yeah, I bet you guys are wondering why there is a random non-unique Corvette in here. Well, the reason is I needed another Corvette to use with the Cannons, and Corellia itself lets them deploy as a react. So I can throw it down for only 4 force as protection against losing the Outrider to attrition. <br />
<br />
A Few Maneuvers - This card was added because there are few times when I need to get the Outrider to the outer rim systems like Kessel and Endor. It is also very easy to track 6 destiny. I also used this card to cause a darkside weapon or device to miss even after they drew destiny. <br />
<br />
Quad Laser Cannons - The Cannons can be found whenever you deploy a Corvette or the Falcon from Reserve with SuperD (V), then forfeited if you need to. They work great with the objective because every single time you fire one, you get to activate a force and then retrieve a card. You also can play cards like Power Pivot which can help you win the battle and retrieve another force. <br />
<br />
Power Pivot  This card is AWESOME. You get to use Dashs game text with ANY ship you want that has a Cannon on it to reduce their power to 0, as well as, make a just hit ship LOST! Moletor (V) only works for characters not Starships. <br />
<br />
Sorry About the Mess Combo  Another very powerful card in this deck. It adds 3 to a Quad draw, lets me kill something during my control phase, as well as let Mace (V) 86 Maul before he can return the favor. <br />
<br />
Hans Toolkit  This card was added to protect either the Falcon or the Outrider from getting beatdown or even captured with a Tractor Beam. Because as you well know, in order for the darkside to hurt me with their Tractor Beam, they have to play In Range to target me at the beginning of the battle and not the end. <br />
<br />
Civil Disorder (V)  The higher deployment makes it so hard to deploy something to my planet, so I decided to use this TECH card to get my Corellians back when I battle, as well as have a card that hurts two other deck types like Senate and Combat. I may switch back to Rebel Barriers though, because in the tournament, I didnt really need it. <br />
<br />
Bargaining Table (V)  I decided to use this start over Strike Planning for two reasons. If you are using Madine and Buckman to flip, it only cost 4 force, but you are not at all protected and you are not adding forfeit to all of your aliens. I like getting Chewie out for 4 force and then pulling Laudica (V) for just 1 force. So I have a totally protected set up for 5 force. <br />
<br />
OOC Combo  This card works very very well with this objective. If you learn to track well, you can put cards that cant go back in your deck on your force pile to then play the OOC combo to get a 5 back in the used pile and place a card out of play. In two games, I used it to place Maul with Stick out of play before he even hit the table. You also need 2 in the deck for playing against Huntdown to cancel Visage. From my experience, you never ever want to use Corran Horn to cancel Visage. Keep him on Corellia or in Space. <br />
<br />
We Wish to Board at Once  It just made since to throw one of these in there, because I have three very important effects that I need to get out; Goo Nee Tay, Entrenchment (V), and Civil Disorder (V). It is also a free 5 back in the deck when I need it. <br />
<br />
Moving Into Attack Position  I added this card because of Danny. He made me release how important this card was because in the game. The only way to really get rid of the Outrider is with attrition. So with this card, the ship is completely immune to attrition and power +2, which also works well with Dash being able to reduce power. <br />
<br />
4 Epps  I play with four Epps; Obi, Luke, Qui-Gon, and Leia, because I wanted to play with characters that would auto retrieve if I used them. All I have to do is fire the weapon, and I get a card back. So it just made since that if I am going to play with a Luke, that he already have his weapon as well as the Leia version. (You may not need both Obi and Qui-Gon, so feel free to sub it out for a different card)<br />
<br />
No third site  Well, at the tournament, I decided to not play with 3 sites because I really really hate floating 0s, but after seeing the power of Tatooine Maul and the ability to flip the Objective back early. It would not be a bad idea to add another site, probably the Forest or Desert. You could even throw in a Sandwhirl for a surprise missing of anyone who comes after you. I would not play with the Farm because if they should come to you, you dont want them to have a drain of 2. <br />
<br />
No Ellis Protection  In the first version of this deck that I played at the V card tournament, I did have Insurrection Combo in the deck for playing against Scum. And now that I see that Scum plays with Set for Stun, I may put that or a Quite a Mercenary in the deck. But because I am playing with vehicles, you dont have to worry as much about getting an Ellis beatdown against you, because without Set for Stun there is simply no way for them to get around the vehicle. <br />
<br />
No Free Ride Combo  The other version also played with this card to get ride of the Occupation cards that can give me problems. I took them out in this deck, because I believed that my weapons would be able to clear any system that was protecting this effect. But, seeing Danny play against Reids Scum deck that played Gela Yeens (V) in space to prevent me from targeting the Space Cruiser, I believe one should go back into this deck. (READ UPDATE)<br />
<br />
What about Activation???  This deck has no problems with activation. You may think that you are choking yourself with only playing three locations that only give you one force each, but if you look at the objective. There are many ways for you to get bonus activation. You get +2 for Corellia, +2 for Palejo, and +1 for each system you occupy thanks to NQA (V). The darkside will give up 2 to 3 icons with most of their starts i.e. Scum, Bespin, Hoth, Endor etc. If they are playing Huntdown, they will be searching at least 2 to 3 times, giving you the 2 force you would have gotten anyway. So you are never really choked for force the whole game. Also, if you look at the characters in the deck, you will see that many of them are not that much to pay for. BoShek (V) is deploy -2 to a Starship and another -2 for Bargaining Table (V), which also makes Palejo deploy for free. Tantive IV (V) is 1 or 2, Spiral reacts for 2, the Corellian Corvette is only 4. So you never really need that much force. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cards that could go in: <br />
<br />
- Grimtaach: to cancel Moletor (V) <br />
- Free Ride Combo: to cancel an Occupation card. <br />
- Targeting Computer: to help hit the Executor as well as allow you to fire one of the Cannons twice in battle. <br />
- Inconsequential Barrier  needed for canceling Set for Stun <br />
- Quite a Mercenary / Insurrection Combo: for Ellis protection <br />
- Rogue 3: to have another vehicle to put at the other site or in case the AT-ST gets killed <br />
- Third Site: to help flip back, and another drain if playing against a space deck. <br />
- General Solo (V) & I Wonder Who they Found (V)  great combo that can be used as another form of protection <br />
<br />
Cards that could be dropped: <br />
<br />
- We Wish to Board at Once: a good card, but probably will be switched out for the Free Ride Combo <br />
- Qui-Gon or Obi with Stick: I have so many Epps as it is, that I really only need one of them in this deck. Probably sub out for the Targeting Computer or an Inconsequential Barrier. <br />
- Captain Han: If I chose to play with General Solo (V), I would change it out. To tell you the truth, I never even put Han out in Space in any of the games I played with this deck. But it will all depend on how much I want Han in space over the ground. <br />
- Luke with Stick: If I chose to play with Luke (V) & R2 in Red 5. I played with Luke (V) in the V card Tournament, so if you want constant force retrieval all game, then he is worth it. Otherwise Luke with Stick is the best match for ground protection. <br />
- Civil Disorder (V)  It all depends on the player. In some games, it was nice to get a character back, yet in others it would have been nice to play with Rebel Barrier. So it will all come down to what you prefer to play with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, thats it. I know you will have your own opinions of how you believe WYS (V) should be played. But now that the PC has confirmed that vehicles do work. I will continue to play with them over leaving the characters to be open to Capture with Fett SE (V) or Hidden Weapons and Lando. Plus if you are relying on General Solo (V) Combo for protection, a CCT Capture deck is going to beat you every single time. My way is the SAFEST!!! <br />
<br />
Thanks, and be looking for my dark deck soon. Please if you are going to rate this deck, make sure you know what you are talking about because I have already gone undefeated at Nationals with this deck. <br />
