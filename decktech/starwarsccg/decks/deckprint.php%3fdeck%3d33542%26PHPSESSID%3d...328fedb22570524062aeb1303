First off, major props to Gemme and Desai for the original version of this deck. Props also to Pistone for some of the changes(namely Sando Aqua Monster) and convincing me to play the deck, Maholick for the Coruscant Guard change before Day 2, along with Evan Fitzgerald, Corey Faherty, and Jim Beyer for convincing me to just play what I know for Day 3.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is the deck I played at Worlds Days 2 and 3(on Day 2, the 2nd Masterful Move combo was The Phantom Menace, but I made the switch because I lost a game Day 2 that lost Jedi Luke with Savrip no less than 10 times in one game, making it nearly impossible for me to take anyone off of the table). It went 2-1 on Day 2, losing only to LS Senate with the aforementioned Jedi Luke/Civil(V)/Savrip crap, and went 3-1 Day 3, losing only to Hunter&#39;s QMC by 13 because of pretty bad luck on my part.<br />
<br />
Why play DS Senate, you ask? I mean, with Scrambled Transmission(V), Leia(V), Civil Disorder(V), etc... how could this deck possibly do good at the World Chamionships? Well first of all, Scrambled(V) isn&#39;t even played. I saw it once, and that was against Lee Edwards in the first round of Day 3, and he only played it because he knew I was playing Senate(and I won that game fairly easily by 10, it would&#39;ve been more had the game meant more, but I won the previous game by 28). Leia(V) isn&#39;t that big of a deal, more of an inconvenience(as I&#39;m sure Desai and Gemme have already mentioned). Every senator has good text, so taking out Lott just makes you draw cards rather than pulling absolutely everything you need. And Civil Disorder(V)? Slows you down a turn from flipping, that&#39;s IT.<br />
<br />
When trying to choose a DS for Worlds, I was pretty much stuck. Hunt Down was pretty much the only deck I was remotely confident with, seeing that everything else was either teched against(walkers), put too many cards on table(CCT), or was simply unreliable. Pistone then came to me with Senate, telling me it was the best choice seeing that no one plays the counters(with the except of Leia(V), but even she was on the decline due to Princess Leia(V) and Boussh(for walkers)). Plus, it is a GOOD matchup against the top 3 LS decks right now: TRM, Profit(any version), and Speeders. So I&#39;ll have to give Pistone huge props for convincing me to play the deck.<br />
While playtesting the deck, we found Colo to be a huge problem. We originally started it(like Gemme and Desai), but the TRM matchup took it away from us, and it really hurt us, especially when stacking a 6 and cracking Mist Hunter(V)&#39;s immunity. Also, the LS has too many ways to cancel our destinies in space. This is where Pistone came up with just starting Sando. No one plays Opee(since it&#39;s cancelled by Colo), Sando CANCELS TRM&#39;s Colo, AND the destiny on Sando is uncancellable, meaning you always get at least one destiny in space even against Bright Hope(V). Combine that one destiny with added attrition from Toonbuck in the senate(and Baron adding 1 to the total battle destiny as well), and you can easily dwindle them down fast. <br />
When I arrived at GenCon, Pistone told me one change I had to make to the deck: Add Coruscant Guard. Maholick apparently came up with it, and it was huge. With the Guard in the senate, TRM(or any other mains deck for that matter) couldn&#39;t send any guys to try and take out senators without taking overflow(for all of you that don&#39;t know, the Guard makes everyone without politics forfiet 0 in the senate).<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not going to bother with matchups, because obviously the deck plays reactively to your opponent. If your opponent starts a system, don&#39;t play yours and take theirs with your space, and HOLD it. If your opponent doesn&#39;t start a system, start Naboo and HOLD that. Remember, against TRM they don&#39;t have ANY battlegrounds besides Kessel and maybe the Coruscant DB(which reminds me, hold YOUR db until they play yours, then replace theirs with yours to screw them on the ground). If they go to kessel, keep draining for 4 at naboo, cancel their drain, and they can&#39;t retrieve due to coward shield and them not having a 2nd battleground.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about the deck, feel free to D-Mail me or simply post it in the review, and I&#39;ll update the strategy section as needed. Like I said before, this is the best deck in the current meta as it beats all 3 of the top LS decks right now(even that Profit Musician beat down crap that was &quot;taking over&quot; Day 1 and part of Day 2 at worlds). One change I might make to the deck is taking out an I Have You Now for a 2nd Vote Now!, seeing that card advantage is huge(and you&#39;d rather not have to draw cards in this, and use your force for other things) and I Have You Now was only played maybe twice in the 7 games I played at worlds. At the very least, it&#39;ll cause people to start wasting card slots in their decks for the counters to Senate, making less room for cards to beat other decks.<br />
