basic concept: complete jedi tests as fast as possible, win some battles, irritate your opponent with cheesy cards until they pull 3 useless d-shields, retrieve lots, and have fun.  because this deck can be unbelievably fun.<br />
<br />
biggest complaint i get is that jedi testing is too slow to win at top level tourneys.  here&#8217;s the reasons why i disagree: for starters, yoda stew; its a great card.  8 times out of 10 you will get one in your starting hand.  so during the opponents first turn, play it to put 4 cards in your force pile.  your first turn: activate ONLY 3, pull the training area, jedi test one, yoda, daughter, yoda&#8217;s hope. (when activating only 3, they should all be in there.)  opponents turn pull test 2.  next turn: complete test one (this might be hard if you only have one site and no yodas hope, but the destiny in this deck is usually sufficient; also, with all 5 sites you generally get a site in your starting hand).  pull jungle, test 3, and whatever you couldnt get last turn (yodas hope, etc).  deploy test 2 to jungle, ask the opponent if he wants to move it (hopefully he won&#8217;t and it stays on the jungle, and you should point out that if he does move it, &#8221;it saves me a turn&#8221; because you won&#8217;t have to move DOS to it), get DOS at the same site as the test.  next turn, complete test 2, deploy test 3 (if you&#8217;re at the jungle, its completed automatically, you can deploy test 4 as well).  after that its self-explanitory.  with all five sites out, yoda w/ yoda&#8217;s hope, and daughter, you need to draw a 4 to complete test 4.  somehow get a 7 on test 5 (tracking helps, as does yoda stew, but i&#8217;ve had blind draws in the past as well).  then the game gets really fun.<br />
<br />
a lot of people see MWYHL and immediately deploy secret plans and come here you big coward d-shields.  others wait to see if you actually train to test 5.  either way, this deck will punish them.  early game i like to try to get anger, fear, aggression inserted to pull the insert shield, since the mob points combo doesn&#8217;t cancel it; alternatively, if they started the combo, play the shield that suspends it, and they won&#8217;t be able to drop the combo and play the shield, so they lose 4 force.  or play scramble to get the scramble shield.  or the frozen assests one.  if they run out of shields and dont play chybc or secret plans, you get 10 free retrieval.  if they play those shields first, they&#8217;ll lose force to your cheese.  for more strategy on pulling defensive shields, see the card choices section.<br />
<br />
i almost always start the game off by deploying battle plan shield.  it really helps to slow the opponent down in the early game, which is instrumental to testing.  and if your opponent started mob points, if they forget to pull a system as their first action, get DDTA on the table so they have that much more trouble getting around Battle Plan...but obviously that won&#8217;t do much against Dark Deal or space decks.<br />
<br />
card choices:<br />
<br />
daughter of skywalker: training daughter was a hard choice for me.  After all, the objective has Luke all over it, even in the pictures.  it feels &#8221;wrong&#8221; to rewrite the Empire Strikes Back with Leia on Dagobah.  but it does win more games than training Luke...<br />
the big thing to remember when planning to train Leia is that she MUST be deployed from the reserve deck with MWYHL or the objective does not target her.  that means, if you get her in your starting hand, you&#8217;re in trouble.  some people pack 2 of her, just for this reason.  i only put one in the deck, and here&#8217;s why.  with 4x Yoda Stew, you&#8217;re almost guaranteed to get one in your hand.  so play yoda stew to put her on top of your force pile, and play your grabber shield.  if you&#8217;re lucky, your opponent will play an interrupt on his first turn.  grab it.  doesnt matter what it is as long as you use that one force to get leia into your Used Pile and recirculate her to the bottom of your reserve deck.  its almost a waste of a shield, but its a very acceptable trade-off.  however, if i see the opponent playing something like speed deal, which has a lot of force drain bonuses that rack up very early in the game, and i get dos in my hand w/out yoda stew, i still have the option to train luke with lightsaber.  i would only train luke in the most desperate circumstances, when it is imperative to get a head start on the training (to cancel force drain bonuses, for example).  really, putting in two daughters would be wasting a card slot, and every card slot is desperately needed in this deck.<br />
<br />
anger, fear, aggression: the perfect insert.  if your opponent starts with mob points/you cannot hide forever, thinking that it cancels inserts, then you have a free pass, cause it only cancels numbers.  if they dont play that, then this card will pull out the you cant hide forever d-shield (or possibly Resistance).  but anger fear aggression is great for a somewhat non-interactive deck like mwyhl, when you have no characters on the table for them to battle.  also amazingly good against lightsaber combat: deploy a jedi, they cant initiate battle anyway.<br />
<br />
scramble: good for a maul beatdown.  drop quigon with saber, play scramble, and watch your opponent scramble for a d-shield.  if they already played 3 shields, watch maul die.<br />
<br />
frozen assests: awesome tech combined with draw their fire.  i once played a game where i had frozen assests on a guy&#8217;s force pile, had a battle, and watched him lost 14 overflow damage, including ghhk from hand, since he needed to use a force to play it thanks to draw their fire.  sheer beauty.<br />
<br />
glancing blow: reduce vader&#8217;s power to zero, use chewie enraged to cancel his gametext.  or if the opponent springs a maul strikes duel on you bfore you flip, cancel one of his duel destinies.  or use it against a Combat deck to make sure you complete Test 6.  but the best use is in conjunction with you&#8217;ll find i&#8217;m full of surprises, especially when Test 6 is on or about to hit the table.<br />
<br />
strike blocked: every deck should have one.  it saves your behind against ls combat.  if the opponent has lord maul with doublesaber with two combat cards, there is no way to beat him in combat with this deck, even with test 5. so cancel one of his combat cards, and make him draw (-1, plus test 3 makes it an additional -1).  compared to your two 7&#8217;s on Test 5, he loses even if he draws a 7, b/c his total will be only 13.  if he can&#8217;t combat your jedi, he&#8217;s in serious trouble.  and unless he has a grabber, this card will come back over and over and over thanks to test 4.<br />
<br />
Yoda Stew: awesome card.  best played in the opponents first turn.  i like it cause it lets me draw a bunch, then put four cards back that i dont want, in my force pile where they&#8217;re actually useful.  destiny is only 3, but that doesnt bother me so much.  also, it pulls a d-shield: the grabber.  and its great for setting up Test 5 or On The Edge.  or upping your differential late-game.<br />
<br />
mercenary armor:  pull it with BoShek or Test 4, put it on DOS, and for the rest of the game (since I never pick her up) it cancels Imperial Barrier.  that means your beatdowns STICK.<br />
<br />
On the Edge: a truly beautiful card.  awesome force retrieval once you&#8217;re flipped, easily guaranteed by test 5.  plus it pulls a d-shield, They Must Have a Code Clearance.<br />
<br />
Amidala&#8217;s Blaster:  a truly worthless blaster in any other deck, a monster in this one.  another great combo with chewie enraged for gametext canceling.  target anyone, draw a 7 with test 5, make them power and forfeit zero for the remainder of the game, or at least until they leave the table.  combos well with glancing blow to make a whole buncha people power zero, ensuring some nice overflow damage.<br />
<br />
End of a Reign:  the biggest problem with MWYHL is that the objective does not cause any damage.  that&#8217;s Reign&#8217;s strong point: after you flip, go Emperor-hunting and make your opponent lose 7 force.  it also works wonders in battle against Vader.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;ll find i&#8217;m full of surprises:  like i said, the objective doesn&#8217;t cause damage, but Jedi Test 6 does.  so capitalize on that damage by using Luke + Glancing Blow (+ Strike Blocked) + Test 5&#8217;s card to place Vader out of play and keep that Test 6 direct damage going strong all game long.  Plus it screws over Hunt Down...although winning an Epic Duel would do that just as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
matchups:<br />
<br />
hunt down: the only ways i could cancel visage is with corran and my transmission terminated, but if the opponent doesn&#8217;t start No Escape i can usually dodge Visage for a while with Honor.  plus i&#8217;ll have luke or a jedi out on the table much of the time (jedi&#8217;s resilience helps get them back when i lose them, and with test 3 and yoda&#8217;s hut all my characters are basically immune to attrition < 4).  but i think that this deck has enough retrieval to fight hunt down effectively.  the key is not to let them get the perfect set up in the early game...but at the same time, i have to make jedi testing my top priority until test 5 is done.  the cheesey cards are going to be key in this matchup.  the insert is good early-game.  glancing blow helps win an epic duel.  if they try using deep hatred and combat cards, strike blocked can beat that.  plus these cards are easy to get in your hand with test 4.<br />
<br />
lightsaber combat:  this is the matchup i built this deck for.  flip fast.  get a seven on test 5.  after that combat is dead.  before that is the problem.  test 1 is important to cancel lightsaber bonuses.  strike blocked is big to cancel combat cards and make them draw.  drop epps for quick beatdowns.  try to get quigon to mauls site for the extra destiny beatdown, but i never like to keep quigon out for them to ls combat, cause i&#8217;m scared of qui-gon&#8217;s end.  its extremely important to control the generator sites against ls combat; once you do, its extremely hard for the dark side to get them back, because they cant battle.  cheese helps big against combat: anger fear aggression hurts when they cant initiate battle, and i love playing scramble when they have a lone maul at the core, then beating down with quiggy.  jedi test bonuses will help a lot against combat.  <br />
<br />
bring him: luckily this decktype hasn&#8217;t been very popular since WYS and DDTA came out.  basically, you just hafta beat him.  dont deploy characters unless you&#8217;re gonna beat someone down.  dont let him initiate battle, and dont let vader stay on the table.  jedi test like you&#8217;ve never tested before, get flipped and win some battles...it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard with Luke coming out of your reserve deck wherever Vader&#8217;s not.<br />
<br />
Scum: this matchup could be tough.  basically, don&#8217;t let them retrieve by initiating battle; always battle them, don&#8217;t let them battle you.  sounds easy, but its not.  without force drain bonuses, and with Court facing Honor, they&#8217;re not going to make you lose much unless they spread out, and when they do, hit them.  win that one major battle.  also, Test 6 direct damage will kill them if you get it out early enough, and from then on you should have the upper hand.<br />
<br />
dark deal:  jedi test one.  jedi test two.  scramble.  it might be harder to win battles on cloud city with dark deal out, but jedi testing is one of the worst matchups for tdigwatt.  ability ability ability is nasty, but honor can help against that; the problem would be preventing them from occupying three battlegrounds.  han/chewie/falcon might help in space (not against ZiMH) after the flip, drawing a bd of 14, but its also good to keep it and the Outrider at Cloud City to prevent the flip.  you might need corran horn in space in red 5 along with the falcon and outrider to make a dent.<br />
<br />
TIEs:  probably the worst matchup.  but with Honor and no force drain bonuses, hopefully they won&#8217;t be able to cause that much damage.  in this matchup my one site becomes big because i&#8217;ll need to force drain there all game long, and hope that makes a dent.  add Test 6 damage to that, plus the retrieval, this will end up being a close game.  after flipping, a Falcon/Outrider beatdown should take care of part of the problem...at least one system.<br />
<br />
61st card choices: alter/friendly fire, houjix/out of nowhere, maybe another luke w/lightsaber, maybe intruder missile for an extra 7, maybe the spiral, maybe r2 brave little droid (for the outrider).<br />
<br />
other ideas: virtual luke and kessel, hold down the system and retrieve a force every turn.  captain panaka and his blaster.  shmi skywalker (she&#8217;s frickin awesome w/ jedi test 3) and 3po w/ parts showing.<br />
<br />
destiny layout:<br />
<br />
0 - 6 (5 are dagobah sites)<br />
1 - 11 (DOS, Yoda, and JT1 dont stay in the deck though)<br />
2 - 5<br />
3 - 12<br />
4 - 5<br />
5 - 5<br />
6 - 5<br />
7 - 4<br />
<br />
originally this deck was built to cross over Vader, but i realized i could win more often if i didn&#8217;t try that.  However, it&#8217;s rather simple to add that aspect of the deck back in and still have a lot of fun with it: simply take out BoShek and You&#8217;ll Find I&#8217;m Full of Surprises to put in I Feel The Conflict and Anakin Skywalker.  Win two battles, drop Luke in front of Vader (except against BHBM), play On The Edge to lose Luke, play Anakin Skywalker, shuffle your Reserve Deck and point to the 7 on Test 5, and cross Vader over, making opponent lose 6 Force.  If the Emperor is there, play end of a reign and point to the 7 on test 5, they lose 7 more force.  easy as that.  and it&#8217;s only two card slots...<br />
