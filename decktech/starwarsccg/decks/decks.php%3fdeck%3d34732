*** Update for V9 ***<br />
<br />
Obvious change is to add in Feltipern Trevigg x2 and his Rifle (v).  Take out the two Dengars and his gun.  Feltipern is destiny 4 and his rifle destiny 2 and the Dengars and gun are all destiny 1, so this is a great improvement.  The rifle adds 2 to weapon destiny, fires for free on any BH, captures and you can take any interrupt from Lost Pile into hand.  Magic.<br />
<br />
I have also added in Close Call (v) from an earlier virtual set.  Subtracts three from any destiny in a battle AFTER its drawn OR allows you to redraw any destiny in battle.  This is more protection for your guys or lets you get an extra go at capturing.  Its only destiny 2 but its worth it.<br />
<br />
Take out one copy of They&#39;re Still Coming Through!<br />
<br />
Update:  response to reviews:<br />
<br />
All Wrapped Up (v):  Maybe its surprising not to see this in here.  I agree that it is a great card for when you have heaps of BHs to come down and battle.  Problem is that often none of them survive the battle.  For example, put down BFBH and IG-88 with Riot Gun against EPP Obi.  Battle.  Iggy shoots and misses.  EPP Obi swings and hits BFBH then draws destiny.  You draw 3 destiny and might get some overflow, but no capture since both your guys are dead.  I tried this a lot and it was damn frustrating - you could sometimes capture but the guy never survived the battle to keep the capture!  You need to come down with 4 or 5 guys to get the capture.  And against two EPPs it was too hard.  With the guns you do the capturing before the attrition segment so AWU (v) is not needed.  I agree that AWU (v) is a good card for using if you want capturing as occasionally a nice &#39;spin-off&#39; event, but not if you want it as your main aim.<br />
<br />
Mostly people want to see Jabba&#39;s Influence (v) in here.  I actually had this card and Jabba in the deck for most of its existence.  After quite a lot of playtesting it suddenly occurred to me that I actually hardly ever used it.  I know that in most aliens decks like Pistone&#39;s Scum deck (which is superb) Jabba&#39;s Influence is used a lot, but this deck simply uses Boba Fett as a tank, with help from other characters.  2 x URoRRuRRR (v) is easily enough to find the characters you want.  However, as I say at the end, if you want to add JI (v) in there feel free.  Take out a ZiMH and something else.<br />
<br />
Fallen Portal:  I should have discussed this in the strategy section.  You will notice that I have  2xThey&#39;re Still Coming Through which are there partly to stop Barriers but more to deal with Portal.  In addition, Dengar (v) can&#39;t be targeted by Portal so I still have capture options.<br />
<br />
Drop YCHF?  I don&#39;t think so.  Having playtesting HB to the max, you need early S&D to win the game.  This card guarantees a win against space decks.  Without it you are taking a big risk.<br />
<br />
All Wrapped Up (v):  Yes, this is another way to capture.  Take out the guns and add lots of characters.  Why not just play Pistone&#39;s Scum deck though?  I am not saying that my deck is as good as that, but it sure can compete with everything LS has at present.<br />
<br />
Drop P-60?  Possible, but that would leave only one non-alien (P-59) to deal with Leia RP.  Perhaps I could add a 4-lom but I&#39;d prefer to have two non-alien characters who can also drain at the Sarlacc site.<br />
<br />
A Gift is a problem?  I can get rid of it once (Sniper) and the deck does not win via drains anyway so I can&#39;t see this as a problem.  The deck wins because if they deploy to the ground, no matter where, they WILL be captured - I have never failed to capture - even Qui-Gon - in any game, and then they lose bulk force.  If they don&#39;t go to ground then the objective damage and S&D and a bit of space hasselling will beat them.  No drains are really necessary, although P-59 and P-60 can drain anyway.<br />
<br />
Space Cruiser?  This could be added (see below).  However, the cruiser is essentially a defensive card - good when attacked since you can react with another ship for free - but this is an attacking deck, which means it is less useful.  Bossk with HT (v) adds a destiny which I think is marginally better, but I agree that there are good arguments for both.  The fact that you can deploy the Cruiser with POTH is irrelevant since the objective gets the ships anyway.<br />
<br />
Could not win a regional?  Well, I probably would agree in general, but after heaps of testing I am starting to think that it would do pretty well and with a little luck in the matchups it could pull off a surprise.<br />
<br />
Remember that the aim was to make a genuinely competitive dedicated capture and feed deck.  While its not going to win Worlds I think I&#39;ve succeeded.  Unfortunately the deck looks a bit like a pile, but it does actually work very well.<br />
<br />
***** end responses *******<br />
<br />
I have wanted to make a dedicated capturing deck for ages.  Most decks which capture are either incidental to the overall deck, using only IG-88 with Riot Gun, or are weak decks which lose.  I wanted a capture deck which would win  a capture and feed deck if possible.  This deck is the finished product of a lot of playtesting, alterations and more playtesting.  It has so far beaten everything I have thrown at it.  The deck debuted at the last tournament in Canberra and went 3-0, beating two MBO decks on the way, which I thought were bad matchups, and a Hyperdrive deck which was demolished.  See my TR for details.<br />
<br />
How to play:<br />
<br />
The choice of starting effects is crucial.  Always start Blaster Rack (v) and Krayt Dragon Bones (v).  If you are against HB, MBO or DBO start YCHF and pull S&D first turn.  If you against TRM start Power of the Hutt (assuming they start Colo).  Anything else start Colo.  Generally pull Oppressive Enforcement immediately because SAC hurts.<br />
<br />
Against most decks you will have 6-7 force first turn.  If you have TWO evasion interrupts in your hand (or Defensive Fire (v)) then deploy Boba Fett from reserve using the AC game text, grabbing his weapon as well.  Also deploy an effect from reserve  first S&V and then POTH.  Remember you can also pull No Escape, so if you ever need to get the top card of your lost pile into hand thats how to do it.<br />
<br />
Against some decks, like space decks, you might only need one evasion interrupt.  Against TRM, you must always assume that they have at least two EPPs, a Sense and some other nasty interrupt in their hand.  If you cant deploy on that assumption then dont deploy at all, even if it means taking some objective damage.  Obviously if TRM is only activating five or less force on their second turn then you are pretty safe since all good EPPs cost 5.  EPP Leia and Han cost 4, but they will probably be captured and LS would be silly to try.<br />
<br />
A safer start against TRM is to play the Sail Barge with POTH and the Passenger Deck, giving more activation for next turn.  Getting the Sail Barge out is a priority, since I have never played a game where I have not captured someone, and you need the Barge to feed them to the Sarlacc.<br />
<br />
Also go for a DB.  If you are playing TRM get Coruscant DB.  Against QMC get CC:DB.  Against other decks get DB94.  Make sure you get the generic DB to opponents sites if possible  Naboo (WHAP or Combat) or if LS is playing any weird generic site stuff.  Notice that Endor DB is not in the deck.  RST is not big here, but if it is, take out Coruscant DB and put in Endor DB.<br />
<br />
Depending on what LS does, you need to get the Sarlacc out sometime.  Hermi Odle (v) makes capturing very easy.  URoRRuRRR (v) is such a useful card.  I would play 5 if I had the deck space.<br />
<br />
Against space decks set up two sites and play S&D.  That plus the objective damage plus some harassing with your ships (which you can download with the objective  how good is that?) should win you the game.<br />
<br />
Then just go and capture guys.  Use Boba and Dengar smart.  You will need to practice a few times.  Retrieve with S&V and get a bunch of aliens at the Sarlacc and retrieve 5 or 6 for each eating.<br />
<br />
Cards:<br />
<br />
Probably the first comment is on the relatively small number of characters.  You should probably compare this to some LS decks like Profit, which use a few good characters and lots of red, rather than most MKOS decks which use heaps.  I found that the interrupts were too crucial to leave out and Boba Fett is such a tank everyone else plays support roles.  Feel free to try a few more characters, but its tough to know what to drop.<br />
<br />
Boba Fett (v):  A powerhouse of capturing tricks, as he should be.  Anyone of ability 3 or less will be immediately captured with his game text  its a just action which is colossal.  The gun will handle most others.<br />
<br />
Boba Fetts Blaster Rifle (v):  Perhaps the best weapon in the game.  Stops running away, can fire at adjacent sites, pulls critical cards.<br />
<br />
Stunning Leader and None Shall Pass (v):  crucial at the AC.  The most trouble I have had in testing is early beat-downs with TRM when Boba Fett dies.  These cards prevent that.<br />
<br />
Sniper:  Remember Boba Fett can capture with Sniper and Dr. Es gun can shoot repeatedly.  Both can fire at adjacent sites.  Sniper is gold with these guns.<br />
<br />
Theyre Still Coming Through:  Cancels LS evasion plus Fallen Portal, which I hate.<br />
<br />
Defensive Fire:  My favourite card in the game.  Magic.  Combined with Hermi Odle you have a guaranteed capture of almost anyone.<br />
<br />
Control:  Anti-SAC, anti Sandwhirl, anti drains<br />
<br />
Dengars Modified Riot Gun:  Read it.  Adds THREE to destiny.  FIVE with Hermi Odle (v).  SEVEN with Hermi and Defensive Fire (and fires free).<br />
<br />
P-59 and P-60:  Good utility characters who can get around Leia, Rebel Princesss text, which is crucial.<br />
<br />
Bossk With Mortar Gun:  to fly Hounds Tooth and to capture with that destiny 1 card which will end up on Colo.  Remember Lando (v) can help capture as well.<br />
<br />
Regeesk (v):  Helps out against some space decks like X-Wing swarm.  May not be a crucial card and could be dropped.<br />
<br />
No Galid???  No.  Usually I take their sites and drain there.  I also found the S&D and objective loss was more important against space than any Galid enhanced drains.<br />
<br />
Match Ups:<br />
<br />
QMC & WYS:  Easy wins.  In playtesting QMC never got close.  Invade CC.  Capture.  WYS is on Tatooine so you dont have to go far for the feeding.  Bobas gun can shoot Patrol Crafts, as can P-59 and P-60.  You will hold the Cantina most of the game.  All the WYS characters are easy to Capture.<br />
<br />
HB:  If they go to ground they get captured.  If they ignore you they lose to S&D and the objective.  Probe with IG-2000 and ZiMH.  I have playtested all versions and tactics:  X-Wing swarm; matching pilots; desert and sandwhirl; forest and have never lost.<br />
<br />
MBO:  I thought that this would be a loss, but in the tournament I beat two of these by 15 and 16 cards.  Invade Y4.  S&D and objective loss will hurt badly.  Retrieve by feeding those Y4 scrubs to the Sarlacc.<br />
<br />
TRM:  See comments above.  This is the toughest matchup and in playtesting I lose once every 5 or 6 games if things go badly.  Their drain at Kessel will be unstoppable, but you can cap it at 2 with Resistance shield.  Once you get set up its lock-down on Tatooine:  they wont be able to battle without someone being captured and then fed to the Sarlacc.  Just be very, very careful early on.  But remember than they will probably have multiples of only three cards which can hurt you:  EPP Qui-Gon, EPP Obi and EPP Luke.  Once these are captured they have nothing left.  I have fed all three to the Sarlacc on several occasions.  I strongly suggest playtesting the matchup first so you get used to how it works.<br />
<br />
Agents in the Court:  Beaten several of these and never lost.  Capture, capture, capture.  If you can set it up, Dr E with his gun and Sniper can fire repeatedly at the site with Tusken Breath Mask (v) and clear it no problem.  Auto-win because once their characters are captured they never come back, so no retrieval loops!  You cant feed them to the Sarlacc because of that stupid card which says they are immune to creature attacks (the Sarlacc should be exempt) but you can put them in the dungeon for retrieval of 2 force.<br />
<br />
Profit:  You lose the AC text (but note that they lose their text as well so they can&#39;t pay 4 to cancel S&V).  Deploy URoRRuRRR (v) and Hermi Odle (v) at the start (don&#39;t deploy Boba Fett since you want his gun as well) and move them both over to the Dungeon.  The worst that can happen is a first turn Boussh but you should draw an evasion card and then you can capture her.  I have not played this but it should be no problem.<br />
<br />
TIGIH:  Have not tried.  Capture Luke and feed him to the Sarlacc, I guess.  You will lose a few force for not having Vader, but who cares?<br />
<br />
Combat:  Have not tried.  Cant see it being a problem.  Use Colo and have a Control ready if they try SAC.<br />
<br />
LU(v):  Obviously JQuille is important here, but even more important is P-59 and P-60 and Bobas Blaster Rifle which can hit vehicles.<br />
<br />
Any deck which starts Obi (v):  He can&#39;t be captured, but he can still be shot by DrE&#39;s blaster or P-59 or P-60.  You might even do it first turn like I did with a bit of luck and Colo.<br />
<br />
Finally, I expect that a few readers might be skeptical about this kind of deck  go try it because it works and its great fun  you really do capture guys and feed them to the all-powerful Sarlacc.  Main guide is not to battle before you are ready.<br />
<br />
Other possible cards:<br />
<br />
- I have used Mighty Jabba plus Jabbas Influence (v) in some versions.  This can be useful but with URoRRuRRR (v) you get most of your cards pretty quick anyway.<br />
- Another Elis Helrot<br />
- Jabba&#39;s Space Cruiser (v) could be used instead of Hound&#39;s Tooth (v)<br />
