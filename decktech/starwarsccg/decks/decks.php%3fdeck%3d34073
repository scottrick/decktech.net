<br />
<b><u>Overall Idea: </b></u><br />
This deck was created after long talks and exchange with Fabien Jacques my playtest partner (his version is 2 cards different than mine) for the Europeans Championship 2004. It did very well for both of us, going 5-1.<br />
The deck&#39;s purpose is simple: use the solid platform of TDIGWATT (no Projection, free Executor, Battle Order and Firepower (V) quickly satisfied) to hold both a Battleground site and system solidly with a minimum of effort, and use your remaining cards to battle the opponent away, with some surprise and tech cards.<br />
Fabien&#39;s version did not pack All Wrapped Up and Alter. He played Mara Jade and her Lightsaber.<br />
His version is more offensive to put some more pressure (he can get Mara with Blizzard 4 while keeping all his heavy-hitters in hand, and Mara means Sense get through all the time even in early game).<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Set-up: </b></u><br />
<br />
The decks starts always:<br />
<br />
<I>All Wrapped Up<br />
Alert My Star Destroyer! (V)<br />
We&#39;re The Bait! (V)<br />
Imperial Decree (V)</I><br />
<br />
<I>All Wrapped Up</I> is a meta call: in days where Profit and EPP strikes are big, capturing can be a big asset. It also scares the hell out of the opponent. This card does not does it all alone, as you will see, there are other cards that work wonderfully with it.<br />
<I>We&#39;re The Bait! (V) </I> of course lets you take They Must Never Again Leave This City for the free Executor.<br />
A few words about it. This deck does <b>NOT</b> use Mobilization Points to get the Executor. There are many reasons behind it:<br />
- the Throne Room threat of Don&#39;t Do That Again (shield).<br />
- any LS deck starting DDTA effect.<br />
-  the free Executor with Mobilization Points is without pilot, unless you have the chance to draw one or a card to pull him, and the pilot, Piett, is crucial in this deck to get an Admiral Order.<br />
- the free Executor with Mobilization Points is power 12. The one here is power 15+BD, and can play Imperial Command for added injury or defense. All in all, it means a more safe Executor, that will not need any back-up for a long time.<br />
Indeed the deck uses <I>Alert My Star Destroyer! (V) </I> to pull Piett/Executor. The overall cost is 2, which is just for Piett. A cost that can be paid everytime (but against a TRM deck starting Goo Nee Tay) turn 1.<br />
The problem with Alert My Star Destroyer!(V) is that youre not guaranteed to do it turn 1. But you have 65% of chance to manage it.<br />
<I>Imperial Decree</I> is for activation, and protection vs. damage, inserts, etc. All in all one of the greatest card for the DS.<br />
<br />
After this, the deck set-ups following opponent&#39;s deck, but usual set-up is getting with Piett the Admiral Order Battle Deployment, which gets in turn Blizzard 2 (V) on the CC: Downtown Plaza (add Veers (V) there thanks to an Imperial Command). <br />
The result is that now you&#39;re holding both a Battleground system and a Battleground site, which are pretty solid: on both you have a character that can use Imperial Command, your immunity is hard to breach (high immunity and no destiny adders), and you can&#39;t be hit by weapons or EPPs.<br />
This leaves you all the remaining cards to take the fight to the opponent, while slowing pinging the opponent to death (drain of 2+1). <br />
Battle Deployment gets you in turn Blizzard 4, which gets Bewil (V) aboard (yes, Bewil (V), not EPP Vader, we do not care about him), which speeds the deck up considerably and makes it a machine. <br />
Bewil (V) lets you take 1 interrupt in your force pile EACH control phase (yours and the opponent), for free. This is similar to Keeping The Empire Out Forever for LS, albeit less powerful, but more versatile (you can play Bewil (V) in any deck), and, mainly, it is a DS card.<br />
Now basically the game is to activate Force and beatdown the opponent with the help of your interrupts.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Space strategy: </b></u><br />
The<b><I> first</b></I> goal is NOT to hold Bespin but to have a fully functional (and defendable) Executor. Indeed you do not care to hold bespin, since you are not basing your play on CC. So feel free to move the SSD around where the opponent is (turn 2 you should have Firepower (v) out, so following the opponent will be very easy). <br />
We should say that the free Executor in itself is powerful enough (especially with Piett & Command) to deal with most the LS can throw at you. But it is not always true.<br />
First of all, let&#39;s admit it, there is the threat &quot;Power Pivot&quot;. Command can help getting 2 BDs (and Piett can be forfeited), but still, if the opponent has some other ships there, it will be painful.<br />
So you have Levitation Attack (v) (how weird, an interrupt that Bewil (v) can pull), that allows you to deploy 3 space devices:<br />
- <b>Deflector Shield Generators (v)</b>: not to be underestimated, this card gives you +1 Force generation, makes you immune to any weapon (no Blue 5 Intruder Missile tech), and to interrupt targeting your ship (Power Pivot or other cancelling immunity interrupts). The Power Pivot threat is no more. <br />
- <b>Tractor Beam</b>: it deploys for free since you are using Levitation Attack (v), and it is nice in the current meta, where the opponent is playing capitals (spiral, bright hope (v), etc.). Of course, it is costly (2 force to use) and then only at the end of battle... but wait... In Range deals with that: an Used 6 destiny Interrupt, it allows you to use the Tractor Beam for free during battle on any ship. Even if you miss, the opponent&#39;s ship is power and maneuver 3 (which allows you by the way another try at the end of the battle even easier), so it is nice. And you add 2 if targeting an unique ship, like, let&#39;s say, Bright Hope (v), Lando In Millenium Falcon, etc. Of course, In Range can be taken by Bewil (v). And it&#39;s a device, so Beldon&#39;s Eye (V) does not subtracts from your destiny draw (evil grin).<br />
- <b>Homing Beacon</b>: the cherry on the cake. Not often used, but helps you win close games. Cancel Landing Claw and prevent drains or beatdowns with free reacts. Since Admiral Piett is an Imperial Leader, you can play it very quickly. Key card in Europeans.<br />
So really quickly you have an Executor with power 17, immune to weapon fire (no Combined Attack) and Power Pivot, which draws one BD, and that can abuse Imperial Command. <br />
The <b><I>second</b></I> goal is to get Zuckuss and Mist Hunter (v) out.<br />
This ship is strong, but what is even stronger, is Black Sun Fleet. This admiral order, against Space, is taken when you are ready with Piett, and allows you for some huge beatdowns on the opponent.<br />
Basically, it boost immunity to Mist hunter (v) by 1 (<4), so against 1 BD it is immune to <7 (<8 with Lando (V)), but mainly threatens the opponent badly if he spreads in space. If it is the case, just move during the control phase the Mist Hunter (v) to a system where there is a lone ship, add some nice characters aboard (R3 Boba Fett, EPP 4-LOM, EPP IG-88), and battle. The opponent runs away ? Firepower (V) makes them lose 2 or Sense it. The opponent does not run ? you will draw some 2 to 5 BDs. Rinse, Repeat.<br />
The <b><I>third</b></I> goal is to nail down the opponent.<br />
This is done thanks to another interrupt: They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor!<br />
Since you already have all the cards to get this combo quick (Bewil (v), and a fully operational Executor), it is easy to get it running. Move (or relocate, thanks to Firepower (v)) the Executor to a system of your liking. During the opponent&#39;s turn, play the interrupt. Now watch the opponent sweat. He cannot run away (nor now, nor in your next turn), so he has to get an Houjix or pack so much power to face you. And since it is an Used Interrupt, it is very easy to get it back with Bewil (V) and repeat the operation.<br />
However, you have also In Range, Imperial Command, and a lethal Mist Hunter (v). The result will be one sided: the LS fleet will take a huge hit, that will be in any way game breaking.<br />
If they spread and hold an Houjix, there will be one less LS ship and Houjix on table (2 force loss), and you will be still able to make control-phase raids with Mist Hunter (v) to chase the escaping fleet. If they hold on, so do you, while battling them with all you&#39;ve got. Since all LS ships are there, you are safe that you won&#39;t suffer spread drains next turn. And it will be a question of time before you can nail down another ship somewhere (TSDTMR! is an Used Interrupt).<br />
<br />
This was for battling. Now, if for some reason there is no opening to battle with the Mist Hunter (v) with Black Sun Fleet (or simply because there is no LS fleet to battle) you can anyway move your BH ship to another system during the control phase for another nice fat drain somewhere.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Ground strategy: </b></u><br />
The opposite: get Battle Deployment with Piett. Hold as usual your 2 CC locations, and battle the opponent on his own locations. You can even deploy characters to CC:DP for reinforcement, and then Elis Helrot them away for a killing blow. Since you have 2 locations heavily guarded, Firepower (v) will be working for all game, basically allowing you to retrieve 1 each turn (if the opponent deploys). <br />
Remember also that Battle Deployment allows you to deploy combat vehicle EVERYWHERE, and to prevent the opponent to draw more than one battle destiny if you occupy the related system.<br />
This is big, very big.<br />
When ready to battle, do it, and with Levitation Attack (v) get Binders and Mandalorian Armor for free on your characters. The best is Binders on Veers (V) and to send captured characters in the safety of Blizzard 2 (V) (immune <6, to <7 with Lando (V)). The result will be all characters forfeited captured with All Wrapped Up.<br />
Considering Lando (v), you have 2 Hidden Weapons (combo with Boba but also Mandalorian Armor) to make some major damage, without considering EPP Maul, Evazan, and EPP Bounty Hunters. So the rule is: there is no useless tracking: a good destiny takes out a character with a lightsaber/BD/HW, but a low one does the same with HW (capture).<br />
Sense any annoying battling interrupt, Trample the opponent&#39;s characters (get back then Trample with Bewil (V) or Blizzard 2 (V)), and use Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son to take out a lightsaber.<br />
For further dominance of ground, you can take Bad Feeling Have I with Lando System (v) (which gets you also Lando (v)). This, coupled with Bespin, means a +3 to deploy to most LS Mains to CC, so you should be safe there.<br />
3 Lando System (V) means indeed a quick Lando (V) (important to take out Lando from LS mains, but also to get Bad Feeling Have I quickly).<br />
Sense any stupid interrupts, and cancel It&#39;s A Trap! with They&#39;re Still Coming Through!.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Card Choices: </b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Blizzard 4</b> (x2): with it you can take both Bewil (V), and then, when the walker dies, deploy another one getting you EPP Vader. It is destiny 4, power 8, ability 4, what can you ask more ? Pullable with Battle Deployment.<br />
<b>Blizzard 2 (V) </b>: the best AT-AT around with Blizzard 4. With Veers (V) aboard you draw always 2 battle destiny, have immunity <6 (<7 with Lando (V)), which means that with Battle Deployment (that pulls it by the way) you are nearly unbeatable. <br />
It does not stop there however: this Blizzard has armor EIGHT. Which means that Leia with her blaster rifle will never hit it without teching for it with cards like Blaster Proficiency (Remember Lando ?). And it can pull also Trample. Which means that with Bewil (V) (/ from the force pile) and Blizzard 2 (V) (/ from Reserve deck) you will always have Trample when you need it.<br />
Having a permanent pilot of ability 2 means also that Lando (V) can pilot it also efficiently in dire situations and still get a battle destiny draw.<br />
<b>Lando System (V) </b> (x3): 3 copies because getting Lando (V) and Bad Feeling Have I quickly is key. During our various tests, these 2 cards proved to be crucial. Since you can get any interrupt with Bewil (V), it is just a matter of time. This interrupt is destiny 4, which is pretty much the same as most of your interrupts, and you can recycle it easily or lose it to a drain afterwards without much remorse.<br />
<b>Imperial Command</b> (x4): 4 of them to have 6 &quot;Executor&quot; drawing cards to get a quick deploy of the SSD with Alert My Star Destroyer!(V). Also, this card lets you pull General Veers (V) (key to hold ground in Blizzard 2 (V) with Battle Deployment), and lets you control the flow of battle on ground or space. Pullable by Bewil (V).<br />
<b>Elis Helrot</b>: one is all you need, thanks to Bewil (V).<br />
<b>Trample</b>: anti-UC spy card, since you will always have an AT-AT handy. Pullable with Blizzard 2 (V) and Bewil (V). Better than Walker Barrage due to Lando (V).<br />
<b>You Are Beaten</b>: some more beatdown. Pullable with Bewil (V).<br />
<b>Levitation Attack (V) </b> (x2): the card that makes this deck so strong. Pulls up to 2 of your devices from under your Starting Effect and solidify immensely the deck.<br />
You can pull Droid Detector against any Threepio that shows his nose out, you have Deflector Shield Generators (V) and Tractor Beam for space, Homing Beacon against Landing Claw  (WHAP ?), Binders to capture some more, and Mandalorian Armor for some more pain.<br />
<b>Hidden Weapons</b> (x2): considering 2 R3 Boba, and some 5 aliens where you can put the Mandalorian Armor, you have 7 characters ready to use this card. With Lando (V) it is very strong.<br />
<b>They&#39;re Still Coming Through! </b>: This card is an interrupt (Bewil (V) pulls it), and cancels especially It&#39;s A Trap!, which seemed to be played a lot in top LS decks. Of course, it does cancel also Smoke Screen, Rebel Barrier, and retarget also Fallen Portal. All in all, a good card, that you can recirculate pretty easily.<br />
<b>Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son</b>: put back a lightsaber (Profit, WHAP, TIGIH) back into used, especially strong if made just before the battle you&#39;re planning against the LS (put back a saber with it, and hidden weapon the next dangerous LS character away), and end game recycle your 6 devices back into your deck. This recycle action can be done also before to set-up some 5-6 surprise destinies for a battle (i.e. you have Maul in hand but only 6 life force left ? no problem: surprise your opponent with a full attack thanks to this card). Cherry on the cake.<br />
<b>In Range</b> and <b>They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor! </b> : already explained. Capture or block ships for beatdown.<br />
<b>First Strike</b>: always nice card. No way to pull it but in a battling deck this is a great card.<br />
<b>Battle Deployment</b>: get your AT-AT quickly, so get Bewil (V) and EPP Vader too, and control ground. No surprise like destiny adders for the opponent there.<br />
<b>Imperial Command</b>: of course, even when Battle Deployment is not in effect, this card helps you in multiple ways in battle in space and ground. Do not forget it.<br />
<b>Black Sun Fleet</b>: nullifies First Strike, of course, but is worth it. When you play it, it is usually against a deck that does not battle you much, so really you make the opponent lose 1 with First and do not risk much of a counterstrike.<br />
<b>EPP 4-LOM</b> (x2) and <b>EPP IG-88</b>: both are good cards, add battle destiny easily on ground and in Mist Hunter (V) and have the excellent characteristic of being bounty hunters (works perfectly with All Wrapped Up) without the drawback of a possible battle from the LS if left alone. Thus, you can bring a full battle on the opponent, capture characters on these droids, and then move them away (far from Sorry About The Mess strikes also). There you have it, some key opponent&#39;s characters are out of the game forever.<br />
EPP 4-LOM is in double copy because it&#39;s cheaper and works very well in space in the Mist Hunter too.<br />
<b>Zuckuss</b>: for the Mist Hunter (V) of course, but against ground decks he is a good character too, since he is a bounty hunter and can have the Mandalorian Armor on for some more pain and Hidden Weapon. He allowed me to win a Profit game by +31 in the European.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Devices: </b></u><br />
It should be under card choice, but there are 6 and need a separate chapter.<br />
<br />
<b>Deflector Shield Generators (V) </b>: Power +2, immunity to Power Pivot, Direct Assault, and any other interrupt targeting your Executor. It also protects you from weapon fire, so no risk from any Combined Attack or Blue 5 tech.<br />
And it gives you force generation +1, which means that with Decree (V) you have the Force Advantage.<br />
One of the best device cards ever created to hold a system.<br />
<b>Tractor Beam</b>: Levitation Attack (V) allows you to deploy it for free, so you do not even have to pay the 2 force to deploy it. Moreover, when you use it, it is in combo with In Range, so you do not have either to pay 2 force to &quot;fire&quot; it. So it is all free, a single card that allows you to play with these incredible 2 cards: In Range and They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor! (both Used and pullable with Bewil (V)). This makes you win games. Capturing the Outrider has never been so easy (remember Lando (V) ?).<br />
<b>Mandalorian Armor</b>: usually put on Dr. Evazan, this card gives your alien power +2, armor=5, and immunity <3. Why on Evazan ? Because Zuckuss usually goes to space, and is not game breaking like Evazan. The doctor with this device is power 8, armor=5, immunity<3, and draws a battle destiny if not able to otherwise. All in all, a main.<br />
But mainly it allows you to play Hidden Weapons, and in conjunction with an EPP Maul or Vader it means a lot of pain, because ANY result from 2 to 6 means &quot;taking out&quot; an opponent&#39;s character from the battle (2-3: captured, 4-5: hit, but with Evazan it means &quot;lost&quot;, 5-6: immediately lost).<br />
Add Lando (V) for some manipulation and you won&#39;t miss, ever.<br />
<b>Binders</b>: this device is usually put onVeers (V) on Blizzard 2 (V) or an EPP droid for more punishment. You could easily end up capturing everyone on the droid (or Veers (V)) with a well planned battle. Which means game over, without any possibility of counterstrike from the opponent.<br />
Indeed, a bounty hunter <b>present</b> is needed to <b>capture</b>, but you can choose afterwards to <b>seize</b> the captives with Veers (V), who does not need to be present.<br />
<b>Droid Detector</b>: Do you know that most LS decks playing Threepio play it on interior sites ? With Droid Detector, you do not cancel the opponent&#39;s droid game text, but you destroy the droid altogether. Of course, the droid can move away. But this is not possible in a TRM deck (where Threepio is at the Throne Room) or in a Profit deck (where Threepio is undercover with A Gift at the AC: since he is undercover, he moves only during your turn, and if the opponent has no force left activated, he is doomed, and if he has some, he will have to move to Tatooine: Jabba&#39;s Palace, where you can Trample it easily). Droid Detector however prevents you from deploying 4-LOM and IG-88 there, so be careful.<br />
<b>Homing Beacon</b>: this deck is based upon the premises that you will be able to battle the opponent wherever he is, thus preventing him from draining you easily where you are not battling thanks to Battle Order. If this cannot happen, a good reason might be Landing Claw. I personally think that Landing Claw is one of the best card possible for WHAP. Homing Beacon is useful too to help you preventing Force Drains (and beatdowns), since you can react for free there.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Weaknesses, Questions, and Overall Choices: </b></u><br />
<br />
<I>You are playing with 4 Shields only. Are you mad ? </I><br />
<br />
Indeed, the 4 Shields are Battle Order, Allegations Of Corruption, A Useless Gesture and Firepower (V). <br />
But in many testing, we understood that you needed really only 3 shields : Battle Order, Firepower (V), and Allegations Of Corruption. <br />
Battle Order for obvious reasons (and you&#39;ll be holding a BG site and BG system fairly quickly and solidly).<br />
Firepower (V) because it is huge in combo with Decree (V), Executor (or Blizzard 2 (V) loaded), and against escape cards. Any deck that is battling the opponent should play it, and this deck can do it as soon as turn 2.<br />
Allegations Of Corruption because you always need a grabber. You can grab any annoying interrupt that is too abusive and Sense the rest.<br />
I will tell you more, in the previous version, there was no anti-WYS shield, but another device (Restraining Bolt) there. Well, it turned out that WYS could be highly problematic, so we had to put this shield there. More will be told on the WYS match-up however.<br />
The shields that were there even before that were Come Here You Big Coward (against Lu/L(V) most of all, but we thought that Lu/L(V) was not so strong anyway to be tournament viable at any big tournament. I know it seems strange, but Lu/L(v) has no hope in space vs. this deck) and Do They Have A Code Clearance (but when you can anyway Sense On The Edge or Off The Edge, what&#39;s the point ?).<br />
After Europeans, even though this deck was 1-1 vs. Bastians Lu/L(v), of course Come Here You Big Coward would have been a big help, but a little adjustment is all the deck needs to have the upper hand.<br />
About Inserts: no one plays them anymore, but you have still Imperial Decree (V) to reduce the damage. Same against Podrace. You can let them retrieve 6, just be sure that you reduce the damage done. All in all, it is not so bad.<br />
So no, I am not mad. It was just a blunt and courageous card choice. And the 6 device retrieval is just too good to pass up. It let me win the game vs. Bastian.<br />
<br />
<I>No Combat Response, how do you plan on taking Mist Hunter (V) and Zuckuss quickly ? </I><br />
<br />
Remember that with Bewil (V), Blizzard 2 (V), Lando (V) or your objective you know each turn what&#39;s in your Force Pile or Reserve Deck, so you know when to draw. I have also double of each card, so it happens pretty quickly (meanwhile you have a super Executor).<br />
Combat Response was a card inside the deck in the early creation stages of this deck, but then we understood it was not really necessary when you are playing only one ship targettable with it.<br />
And if you are really stubborn about it, better to play a Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back (pullable with Bewil (V)).  <br />
Understand also that with Alert My Star Destroyer ! (V) starting and no Combat Response, opponents were wary of other ISD strikes (Thrawn and Chimaera, for example), not Mist Hunter (V) and Zuckuss.<br />
<br />
<I>What about the Mist Hunter (V) ? He could get shot!!! </I><br />
<br />
Sure. An X-Wing cannon is all it takes, but remember that thanks to Lando (V) the opponent still needs a 5. Remember also that you can pick up your fights with Black Sun Fleet. And that you have doubles of Mist Hunter (V) and Zuckuss.<br />
All in all, this deck used to have even both a Dark Maneuvers (non combo) and an Overload to deal with it. Dark Maneuvers is more of a surprise (allows for a beatdown) and it is a 6 (great for some tracking and In Range), while Overload was very good due to Lando (V) against armed persons, but the effectiveness vs. Cannons was limited (since you have really to play this interrupt before battling if it is your opponent&#39;s turn, so the surprise factor is gone). But we decided the slot could be used for something better.<br />
Consider also that the Executor with Devices is unbeatable and that you still have They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor! To pin down the opponent&#39;s fleet.<br />
<br />
<I>You have low destinies. Too low</I><br />
<br />
Well, this is actually not so true.<br />
Of course, the deck has NO destiny 6 or 7, but the 2 Admiral Orders (1 of those is on table anyway so) and In Range (not recyclable). As for destiny 5, you have the Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son and that&#39;s it. So this leave us with 4. Well, there are actually a lot of 4 19 to be precise, which is a lot. Can you survive with 4s ?<br />
Sure. <br />
A couple of 4 will hit any Jedi usually.<br />
A 4 is good battle destiny (but not game breaking).<br />
2 4 for battle destiny is even better and considered a good draw.<br />
And a 4 is either a 5 or a 3 with Lando (V). Which means that you can capture guys with Hidden Weapons or Trample Boussh or a lot of support characters the LS has.<br />
And if you really need some hard core destiny set-up and tracked, just play Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son lost and cycle back the devices you want.<br />
Considering that, and Lando (V), the destiny work just fine. It was proved again in Europeans. 4s is all you need.<br />
<br />
<I>Sabotage (V) will kill your devices!!! </I><br />
<br />
Please Anyone thinking among these lines can stop reading and go rating another deck. Is Sabotage (V) immune to Sense ?<br />
No.<br />
Although I like very much Sabotage (V), which I play and is a good card, you have to get the destiny draw low enough to destroy the device. Usually the two nasty devices are the Tractor Beam and the Mandalorian Armor Can you draw a 2 or less ? I doubt it, without tracking (unless you have a lot of spies on table, which is meaning that this DS deck is losing the game anyway).<br />
And even so, you have to hope I do not have a Sense, or the force to mess up with Lando (V).<br />
Or you are playing WYS, but WYS has mid-high destinies too, so it is ok.<br />
Or you are playing MWHYL.. hmmm this deck won a game vs. it at his last game (top tables).<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Match-ups: </b></u><br />
<br />
<b>TRM</b>: start the usual 3. Get a quick jump if possible at Bespin with a solid Executor and start draining. TRM do not pack usually starfighters, so you can add Mist Hunter (v) to the sector for a drain of 1+1. Use Decree (V) every turn to speed your activation up until you get things going. Deploy on ground only to beat down the opponent or if you have the cards to make it work. Firepower (v) will be a little useless in this match-up but can be worthwhile some turns. Battle Deployment is of the utmost importance to keep things in check on the Downtown Plaza, as is Bad Feeling Have I. If the opponent deploys first (like he should), activate and attack, leaving you action 1 in the battle (which should be a capturing action).<br />
If things are looking difficult, do not hesitate at deploying everything to the Executor, and then, when you feel safe enough, to shuttle all of it down.<br />
There will be a Sense War. You have to win it, one way or another. With Bewil (V) it can be done, and you have the same activation going than the opponent. <br />
<b>Profit</b>: like TRM. Start Decree (v), and not hesitate to use it for activation if the opponent starts pulling 2/0 sites. Get space running, and deploy heavily on ground. The absence of I Am Sorry will make the opponent wary for a Imperial Barrier. If you are well defended on ground, the opponent might leave you alone (and this is where Firepower (v) comes into function), or try to battle you (thanks to Savrip). Savrip is a pain, but Savrip does not protects from weapon strikes or capturing weapons or interrupts, and you have Alter to deal with it (unless Hopping Mad is on table). Get out your 3 shields, and basically the only retrieval Profit will get off is Han (v) (Sense any On the Edge, and grab the most annoying interrupt). Also, do not run to deploy on ground: Profit does not care to lose some cards on battles, since they will retrieve them later. <br />
All in all, welcome home: this is the first deck about battling that can actually hold its own without any dirty objectives tricks against Profit (which is usually what is doing BHBM or CCT by taking out characters from them) pretty well, and without caring for the Audience Chamber.<br />
Remember that Veers (V) with Binders and someone with Hidden Weapon outside or a Bounty Hunter is all you need to kill the opponent.<br />
<b>Lu/L(v) </b>: start Decree (v). This will get your activation going. On the good point, this Dark deck does not need to hold Bespin at all, so move as soon as you can to Hoth with the Executor for a fat drain of 2. Lu(v) does not have great destiny generally, so once Luke in his speeder is on hoth with some other, you just need to pack Blizzard 2 (v) and Veers (v) to CC (maybe with Blizzard 4 also) and youll be safe from EPP strikes. With this in mind, Firepower (v) starts his magic, and you prevent the opponent from using Frostbite (v) (it is an auto-loss for the LS to go in space against this dark space). So you will be draining for 2+1 (+1 if holding B:CC). You won&#39;t block opponents drains because the Coward Shield is not in the deck, but still the opponent will have to pay 3 for each one. When the shields go down, you have two options: deploy/move to 2 different sites, unflipping Lu(v), or battle them in force with a couple of Sense against these stupid reacts. Whatever happens, Decree (v) will keep the damage=1. Winnable but not so easy match-up. If the LS goes to space, either Black Sun Fleet them into oblivion, either beatdown them with In Range / They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor!.<br />
In case you fear a recurring Landing Claw (Bastian&#39;s deck), just do not deploy the Executor if you can help it, or do it if you have an Uncertain Is The Future in hand. In case, switch all your Sense for Sense Combos.<br />
<b>Senate</b>: extra caution needed. Senate usually jumps on Deal when it gets deployed. Here you&#39;re not aiming for spead, but for control. Senate is not Profit, there is no retrieve 10 thing. The Senate Drain can be handled through Battle Order, or Firepower (v), so it is no big deal.<br />
The problem is the effects to burst your immunity to attrition and makes your BD worthless. Well, do not spread. Keep to the system, and unload a lot of guys to the ground for battling. There is no political effect for stopping hidden weapons and capture, and once you start capturing guys, the game will become easier for you.<br />
Add Bad Feeling Have I and you should be fine.<br />
<b>HB</b>: now this is not as hard as one may think. Get the Executor out asap. Get some token force on ground (if not playing against HB Mains) like a Blizzard and EPP Vader. Get Bewil (v) on Executor and start manipulating your hand. By turn 3, you should have out Bewil (V) and all you need to take the fight to the opponent. Black Sun Fleet with Mist Hunter (v) any spread from the LS, stop dead any ship with They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor!, and so on. This game will be bloody, because you will be forcing fights quickly. Firepower (v) is huge in this match-up (relocate the Executor for free anywhere in the galaxy). <br />
Of course, you should use all your strategy to probe quickly (Black Sun Fleet helps).<br />
Once HB is out of play, it goes downhill for you.<br />
<b>QMC</b>: tricky, but definitively on your side. Indeed the strategy is to let your opponent deploy his locations while losing 1 to active his icons. This is because your opponent will activate a lot, so you can as well take advantage of it (you activate the same but you drain the full amount).<br />
By deploying his locations, the QMC deck will have less cards in life Force (meanwhile, get Bespin CC into hand to lose it for drains or for Decree (v)). About space: the surprise factor of a quick Levitation Attack (V) with Tractor Beam is devastating. Even without the surprise factor, there is not much that the LS can do to you: Beldon&#39;s Eye (v) helps with defense value of ships, but not against Devices, and the Tractor Beam is a device. This means that Lando In Millenium Falcon (in case you did not manage to put Lando (V) first) is captured with a 2 only with In Range, the Outrider with a 3, and so on. Even if you miss the In Range beam, you have another possibility at the end of the battle with a -3 to the opponent&#39;s maneuver. Once the system in your hands (the only possibility for the opponent, is to jump on you), you have better control of the game: the opponent will have to pay for his drains on the ground, and won&#39;t be able to use CC Celebration. <br />
Sense any On/Off The Edge. You will be activating the same amount of Force, draining for 2 at the system (and why not at the Sector also), and as soon as you&#39;re ready, you can battle the opponent or just go and sit at the Downtown Plaza. With the latter option, you get drain 2+2 (maybe 2 also at CC sector), retrieve of downtown plaza, and Firepower (v) working (since there is no Weather Vane (v) tech at exterior sites, and you have AT-AT deployed there, the opponent will have a hard time even trying to take you out of there). So it is retrieve 2 a turn while drain for 6, without paying. 8 Force swing, so you can say game over. The QMC, which has never been character heavy, will just fold over very quickly.<br />
Some QMC, however, could know the threat of TDIGWATT as Dark deck, and can plan their games accordingly. Good cards can be Computer Interface (V), and Logistical Delay (V). Well, Computer Interface (V) has to be grabbed if you cannot kill Lobot (or just then add a Weather Vane (V) to your deck so that you can capture Lobot after he ran there), because it can be game breaking. And Logistical Delay (V), well, you have Alter. Hopefully the opponent won&#39;t be able to use it AND battle you on the same turn, so you can react to it in the proper manner.<br />
For those thinking that QMC can jump on Executor turn 1 and outdamage it thanks to Outrider + Dash and Luke in Artoo-Detoo In Red 5, this is only partly true.<br />
The LS has in this case power 6 + 8 = 14 and subtracts from you 6. The Executor, if on table, is with Piett, so it is power 15.<br />
So it is 14 to 9. Quite a big gap.<br />
However, if you have Piett on table, then you have Battle Deployment.<br />
Put it on table then, the power switch quickly:<br />
4 + 6 = 10 for the LS, to 15 4  2 = 9 for the DS. (the Outrider subtracts only 4 now).<br />
Not anymore easy, right ? especially since the DS needs only a 4 to burst the Outrider&#39;s immunity.<br />
If you had the luck to get also one of those 6 cards into hand (Evazanx2, Lando System (V) x3, Lando (V)) then the DS can by losing 1 to activate 7 turn 1 deploy even a pilot for a boost of 3 to power.<br />
Some expert of QMC tried or did this DS deck and did admit that the DS was hugely advantaged.<br />
<b>Combat</b>: usually Racing. Against Racing you will have to take the 3 force loss (I say 3 because Decree (v) should be starting) letting them get back 6. It is not, however, worse than the retrieve 5 or 10 of Profit. Combat is not a great match-up for this deck, and it all boils down to a single point: has the opponent some anti-Elis Helrot card ? If he has, there will be difficulties. <br />
Never seen this match-up, but you can hold Malastare more easily than any other deck and you have a shot at battling away opponent&#39;s characters. Use Firepower (v) everytime you can (it will let you retrieve one the turn they combat you). One thing is sure: you won&#39;t be able to win a drain race. So just do your damage (3/4 a turn) and go to fight them. Combat is all about cards in hand (both for you and your opponent). I think it is be a disadvantaged match-up. But combat has some big problems vs. MKOS or other huge battling decks with AAA(v).<br />
<b>EBO</b>: This dark decks gives the opponent 3 icons very quickly. Any good EBO, then, will be able to get EBO running by turn 2 (usually). Well, by turn 2 (usually) you should have the Executor on Bespin and someone on the Downtown Plaza. So you will be draining the same (2+1 vs. 3 at a system). EBO activates a lot, and deploys nearly everything for free, so you need all the activation you can muster. Basically, do not deploy the B:CC (it could get swarmed) so that you can lose it for Decree (v) and retrieve it back with the CC site (then taking it back into hand with the obj). Firepower (v) should be played as soon as possible, it will help you get back one more card into hand a turn until there will be some fighting going.<br />
The good point vs. an EBO, is that the EBO player won&#39;t see your beatdown coming: your starting effects do not show anything, so as soon as there is an opening (i.e. the opponent goes on another system to drain you more), jump on them with Mist Hunter (v) and crew. You can draw as much as 5 BD with that ship. Then, after the beatdown, move everyone to the main system where the opponent is. This Dark deck is very quick to get the job done, and Black Sun Fleet helps a lot too. Playtested this match-up a lot: you have the advantage.<br />
<b>MWYHL Test 5</b>: hard match-up (but hardly seen). You may lose this one, since you will drain for 2+1+1, will maybe put some pressure with deploy +3 due to Bad Feeling Have I and Bespin game text, but that&#39;s all. The opponent will surely ignore you, and will pass Test 5 without even fearing Secret Plans or other stupid stuff.<br />
Worse, you will have a hard time playing Sense or Alter, and an impossible time once MWHYL is flipped.<br />
And when there will be a 7 on the Test 5 (your only hope to stop this is to play a Sense & Uncertain Is The Future just before the end of the turn), well, the Executor&#39;s immunity or the Blizzard 2 (V)&#39;s one wont mean much. Still, the deck managed to hold its own at the Europeans, so who knows.<br />
So your goals there is to get ready for the onslaught, and build up your strength at both the system and site.<br />
Grab of course On The Edge. Your lightsabers strikes will have also a hard time passing through (you will maybe need Lando (V) very much), and your best bet to kill the opponent is to capture his characters with All Wrapped Up (doable) and Hidden Weapons, thus preventing the opponent from possibly throwing other guys at you (or at least mean ones). <br />
If you really fear this match-up, I would advise you to play a few Force Field.<br />
All in all, we decided that we would not see much MWHYL (and crossed our fingers not to meet any). Of course, if your name is Karrdeshark, well, you might think differently. :)<br />
But in the Europeans, Fabien Jacques met a MWHYL test 5 with Super Falcon and still beated it by more than 20 cards (and he forgot to use the Tractor Beam), so I think it is not so difficult thanks to our interrupts.<br />
<b>WYS</b>: this deck is making a come back. Decree (V) in this match-up is useless. So it leaves you with either First Strike starting, either with no 3rd effect. Although there are different theories about the utility of First Strike starting (Fabien and myself had different opinions), I do think you are way better of by starting it.<br />
Why?<br />
Simply because any good WYS will give you a run for your money, and a hard one at that. But you&#39;re starting TDIGWATT. But you&#39;re not starting I Am Sorry. WYS in the beginning will be wondering what are you up to, and they will (wrongly) think that you are not playing I Am Sorry for the only good reason you might think of: you want to play Imperial Barrier.<br />
Is it farfetched ? No it&#39;s not. ANY dark deck starting First Strike is basically shouting I am playing Imperial Barrier to keep the First Strike advantage. No I Am Sorry AND First Strike is basically a sure way to get the message to your opponent. Which is all for the best, then. Keep always some force activated to keep the bluff. WYS cannot go to battle you easily without a couple of characters (a smuggler alone isn&#39;t doing anything, they need two, and WYS does not play EPPs Jedi), and from these two, there will be for the Light Side the definite threat of getting Barriered. Which means that the LS will not go battling you with less than 3 smugglers. Which is not happening easily. So First Strike really helps you keeping the WYS from your toes. Which is good, because besides a quick and free Executor, you will be hard pressed to keep up with WYS speed.<br />
In this match-up, there are a few things to consider:<br />
Activate. You need a decent amount of activation, while WYS does not need so much, since they have a good objective that allows them to play a bunch of tricks, and then some more again. So even though you might think that deploying the Bespin Cloud Sector is stupid, it is not. It gives you 2 much needed icons more, and trust me, the opponent will not go there. Why ? simply because it is not a system, so if you take them out from systems, they will have to pay 3 to drain (due to Battle Plan or Battle Order). Since Bespin:CC is a drain 2 location, there&#39;s no reason it should be better than Bespin itself, which is a system you just gave to them (got to do that to get the Free Executor). Indeed, with Tatooine, Kessel, and Bespin, the LS has plenty of choice where to drain you at.<br />
Shields: this is the only occasion where you should NOT play the Battle Order shield. This is because you need badly A Useless Gesture, and because any WYS will try to hold both ground and space anyway, so they will be highly tempted to play Battle Plan themselves.<br />
Set-up. You need to set-up. This do means getting out Blizzard 4 and Bewil (V) (shuttle up him aboard the Executor, or just deploy them both to the ship to force a Battle Plan from the opponent), to start pulling your interrupts. This means Levitation Attack (V) to pull your Deflector Shield Generators (V) but especially your Tractor Beam (you need it to nail the opponent&#39;s fleet and destroy it). And this means also getting They&#39;re Still Coming Through! And some characters to deal some damage on the ground.<br />
Now of course you will suffer drains, but you have some advantage: no one is going to battle the Executor (not with the threat of Imperial Command and Imperial Barrier) in the beginning, and not even in the middle: WYS will just think it is smarter (and indeed it is) to just run around, spreading to other systems.<br />
Well, with some hold on a site, you are actually draining too (of course you&#39;re losing the race) but you can also battle for some good results: retrieve/lose with First Strike, and due to the Imperial Barrier threat, you have also most of the time Firepower (V) working for you. <br />
As soon as you manage to nail down the opponent and deal him some damage, it will all be much easier.<br />
Other problems: WYS has the knack to play some Admiral Orders. With Control & Tunnel Vision, it becomes even worse. So your brilliant strategy of keeping your AO&#39;s on table is not going to work a lot. Of course, you have 2 AO also, so it will be a race to keep the other AO off the table, which is somehow fun I should say.<br />
WYS has also this horribly easy to flip objective, with an even more horrible easier way to keep it flipped. And the 7 side kills totally your Sense and Alter. Fun isn&#39;t it ?<br />
Well, nothing to do on that one. If you actually think you can get them to flip back and Sense something, please do. I would not be on it though. Anyway, just in case, you have now 4 useless cards to throw to the lost pile. Nice isn&#39;t it ?<br />
<b>WHAP</b>: this deck is beginning to become like WYS. A bunch of tricks, and Secure Route (V), the card that did it all.<br />
Well, take a deep breath.<br />
Get the CC sector on table only when you have Mist Hunter (V) to be deployed there.<br />
Indeed, the perfect set-up is:<br />
Executor with Piett and Bewil (V) on Bespin<br />
Mist Hunter with Zuckuss or Lando (V) on B:CC.<br />
Blizzard 2 (V) with Veers (V) on the Downtown Plaza.<br />
All in all, it is a drain of 2+1+1 for free, while reducing WHAP by 3, so only 1 to you.<br />
You are also retrieving every turn with Firepower (because WHAP will deploy characters everyturn to get back cards with Secure Route (V)).<br />
WHAP can of course drain you and damage you. But they will run out of characters sooner or later, or you will battle them before that.<br />
Indeed, build your strike team of EPP Maul, Evazan, a BH droid, and why not EPP Vader and/or Boba Fett.<br />
Then use Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son on a ligthsaber if there is one. Your next turn, do the following:<br />
Go to the Throne Room, Levitation Attack (V) for Mandalorian Armor and Binders, You Are Beaten someone before the battle, battle, cancel Its A Trap with They&#39;re Still coming Through!, Hidden Weapon  on the next problematic character (the Queen would be great), killing her or capturing her (best the last), then start swinging like mad, operating away your opponent&#39;s characters. Result: beatdown, you just forced the Houjix. Then move away your full of captives droid bounty hunter out of reach. You&#39;ve won the game.<br />
Remember that you can always Alter Secure Route (V). Indeed, you do not fear from any On the Edge there, so just grap Control & Tunnel Vision as soon as possible, and then grin evilly when the opponent has not enough force remaining to play another one to control your Alter.<br />
<b>MBO</b>: considering the number of players capable of playing it at an expert level in the world (that is, not many), you shouldn&#39;t see it a lot. If you see it, well, you will likely lose, unless youre an MBO expert yourself. In the match-up in the European Championship 2004, between MBO and this Deck (me and Fabien Jacques, both with the same decks) we thought it could go either way. He was unlucky, so he lost with MBO.<br />
