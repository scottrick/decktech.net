Card Error: The 2nd Imp. Artillery is supposed to be a Colo Claw Fish. Also second presence maybe for a Nabrum. <br />

Mistake: Blaster Rack is [v]<br />

<br /><br />
This is a fun deck:<br />
<br /><br />
I&#39;m going to describe this the way I played it against a friend because it is hard to describe how to play, or at least I can&#39;t figure out how to. He was playing Tosche Station.<br />
<br /><br />
(10 Force Activated)<br />
<br /><br />
Pull Executer with YCHF-MP. I then used a Lev Attack to put the Carbonite Console in the Carbonite Chamber then used one force to pull Executer for free effect. Pull CC:DB as well. (9 Force Left) Executer went down for free and I then ditched YCHF-MP to pull combat Responses. Flashed Virago for Xizor and placed him with Ex. (5 Force Left) Drew 3, got a Lev Attack and  played it. (2 Force Left) Shield Generator went down onto the Ex.<br />
<br /><br />
He did his thing allowing me to activate and draw twice. I only drew. I got Scimitar 2 and Dominator. <br />
<br /><br />
(11 Force Activated, 13 Total)<br />
<br /><br />
I drain of 1 at Bespin and then pay one to deploy colo claw fish. (12 Force) Throw dominator one fish. Flash Scimitar 2, grabed Jonus and deployed to Tat. (10 Force) Pulled the Proton Bomb with Scim. 2 Game Text. Deployed Blaster Rack from hand, then Blizzard 4 from hand and grabbed Vader and stick to the Jedi pulling site [Can&#39;t Remeber name]. (5 Force) Deployed Bombing Run on Tosche Station. Scim. moved down to block his drain and prepare for a battle. Deploy grabber shield and oppressive enforcement.<br />
<br /><br />
He plays alter on bombing run, misses. He drew a seven with Tat Quiggy at Tosche. I grab it. (4 Force) He deploys a Luke, RS and Screaming Lando to tosche and battles. I drop the proton bomb on him and both Qui and Luke go bye bye thanks to dominator, now a lev Short Range on Fish. Draws a 6 for destiny and I forfeit Jonus. Scimitar 2 stays floating above Tosche Station.<br />
<br /><br />
(12 Force Activated, 16 Total)<br />
<br /><br />
Drain 1 at Bespin, 3 at Jedi Site. Use 1 to find Presence, it goes to bespin. (15 Force) Moved Vader over to Lando. (14 Force) Drew up a little bit and found maul and Bobba.<br />
<br /><br />
He deplys another Quiggy with stick and forgot to save to battle. I grin. Now Lando dies as well.<br />
<br /><br />
(12 Force Activated, 26 Total)<br />
<br /><br />
Drain 2 Bespin, I deploy both Maul and Bobba, maul finds his stick. (14 Force) I Battle (13 Force) Swing with maul, maul draws two scimitar bombers. Micheal breathes a sigh of releif thinking guiggy lived. I show him Planetary subjugation, I just drew two sevens. +1 thanks to Apprentice. So I just drew a total of a 16 against him. Quiggy hits Fett and I draw a 5, 4, 2 site cleared. Fett dies, I was immune. I through out Battle Plan.<br />
<br /><br />
From there he dropped after another turn with Tantive, Bright  Hope and a couple other people to Xizor beating the crap out of him. After that it was a drain race. Which he lost cause he couldn&#39;t satisfy BP. I won by like 9 or 10.<br />
<br /><br />
That was the best game I played against him. God opening hand. Other times he knew what to watch for and beat me by 14 and 21 while the other time it was me by 4.<br />
<br /><br />
I can&#39;t really do a matchup section because it is a fun deck that hasn&#39;t been played against serious decks. Tosche Station was the only one. Although this deck did well against the Ewok deck I built. Major problem though is a heavy draining deck easily wins. With one spy, there isn&#39;t much I can do to block.<br />
<br /><br />
Overview:<br />
Send the bombers in first, obliterate the place and then send vader and maul into clean up.<br />
