(60)   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I won’t write too long of a strategy section (I&#39;ll go into more detail on card choices and matchups), because it’s mostly pretty straightforward. Use LLL(v) to pull a location (the Generator if you get Vader, the Battle Plains if you get Blizz 4), and BFHI(v) to get out Deep Hatred or (if that&#39;s in your force pile) Darth Vader’s Lightsaber. Obviously, the idea is to get Vader out ASAP to flip. Then you duel Jedi off the table (and out of the game), and let your ping cards (Emperor’s Power (v), Emperor’s Prize (v), Search and Destroy, and, obviously, VotE), plus your drains at Naboo (all at least 2) do the rest of the work. Not counting the cards I pull on my first turn (Deep Hatred and one of the locations), this deck&#39;s average destiny is close to 3.7. <br />
<br />
Card choices:<br />
<br />
Location, Location, Location (v) – Not the typical Huntdown start. I got the idea from another Huntdown deck on DeckTech, and this one has its advantages and disadvantages. For one, this one isn’t free, and it also lets your opponent pull his locations. However, it also makes your locations destiny +1 (in other words, NO ZEROES), and lets you play ANY battleground planet site, which means I can play the big generation Naboo sites, which means fewer locations and bigger generation/drains. Also, the text allowing my opponent to pull locations isn’t that big of deal, because almost every deck has it’s own way of pulling locations, so it isn&#39;t a major disadvantage.<br />
<br />
They Will Be No Match For You – I had trouble picking the third effect, because there were so many options. However, I like letting Maul get in on the dueling action from the get-go. I start AAA(v) here against combat.<br />
<br />
Janus Greejatus – As Pistone (I think) said, if you play two Emperors, you play Janus - it&#39;s science. The force drain bonus with Palpy and the ability to put cards back in the deck make him indispensable.<br />
<br />
No Sidioius – I’ll be putting Jedi OOP w/ Epic duel, and thus don’t need him.<br />
<br />
Lando (v) – I think I’m addicted to this card. If you have the force, you can swing duel draws 4 (+2 on your draws, -2 on opponents) points in your favor with this guy. Unbelieveable.<br />
<br />
Lord Vader (v) – What else in HD dueling? I might change one to a DLOTS if you&#39;re expecting QMC.<br />
<br />
The Emperor (v) – Thought about having 2 standard Palpys for the destiny, but couldn’t resist the ability to fry people (especially against Senate/QMC).<br />
<br />
Ability x3 (v) – Gotta have it for the combat.<br />
<br />
I’ve Lost Artoo (v) – Yes I know this card draws a lot of flak. But to be honest, it lets me fit cards I wouldn’t have had room for otherwise. Evader & Monnok is obvious; Trample is in there because of Blizzard 4; Hutt Smooch keeps spies out of the Holotheater; Weapon Levitation lets me take a Saber away from a Jedi to reduce his duel destiny draws.<br />
<br />
Security Precautions – a must have in Huntdown, because of the vulnerability to Hidden Base. The Emperor’s Prize (v) helps here, too.<br />
<br />
Cold Feet (v) – I love this card. I love the ability to play as many shields as I can. I also love the ability to suspend Goo Nee Tay. I love the fact that it’s a destiny 5 used. I love that it cancels a bunch of other stuff. But most of all, I love being able to get your grabbers at will. Why do I use Something Special Planned For Them (v) instead of There’ll Be Hell to Pay? Two reasons: 1) Destiny – using Cold Feet (v), I can pull a destiny 5 card to use with Deep Hatred; 2) Starship retrieval – crucial given there’s only 3 starships in the deck – losing Maul’s off the top could really hurt.<br />
<br />
Control & Set For Stun – SAC isn’t a problem vs. Huntdown, but Sandwhirls are.<br />
<br />
Elis – sometimes it’s easier to move Vader around this way. Also makes it easy to move Maul to his next duel.<br />
<br />
Only 1 Focused Attack? – Yes. With Lando, Deep Hatred, and Darth Vader’s Lightsaber doing what they do, I feel confident that I’ll win most duels. Thus I use Focus Attack for emergency (or Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (v)/Combat) purposes.<br />
<br />
I Have You Now – Makes battling more fun if dueling isn’t an option.<br />
<br />
Imperial Reinforcements (v) – Aliens tech. This used to be Empire’s New Order (v), but every QMC deck packs at least 1 YubYub, which kills it. Plus w/ TBM and Ellors and all the rest of the annoying crap, you can take overflow if you battle. The best way to kill QMC is to go after the aliens at the sites (not Dash) without finishing the battle. Unfortunately, K’lor’slug (v) prevents you from killing aliens before the end of the battle (like with Dr. E and Emperor). This card is the key – cancel K’lor’slug (v), then drop Maul w/ Saber, Dr.E, the Emperor (to any empty site, obviously), and DLOTS (which I’d seriously consider packing if you’re expecting QMC) to kill off a bunch of aliens without even getting to the damage stage of the battle. Repeat as necessary. <br />
<br />
Unsalvageable – Need a card to cancel OOC, despite my backup Visages. This is Some Rescue has the higher destiny (by 1), but Unsalvageable has more relevant uses.<br />
<br />
Vader’s Anger – this card is sick.<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
Mains – duel the Jedi OOP, then let the other cards do the work. This deck was built to destroy mains. Combat is sort of a tricky matchup. Gotta start AAA(v) instead of TWMNMFY. There’s no combat shield (so that you can use Deep Hatred to your advantage), so make sure you deploy a Dark Jedi to Naboo before you deploy another character (like Lando). Your advantage is that they have to wait to their move phase to initiate combat, but you can duel anytime. And once Quiggy, Luke, and Mace lose their duels, they’re done for. You’re going to need Lando and/or Focused Attack, though, because they can use Civil Disorder (v) to cancel your combat cards. If you get lucky, they might not expect Deep Hatred and thus not start Civil Disorder.<br />
<br />
HB – Huntdown’s traditional weakness. Set up ping cards ASAP (Search and Destroy and The Emperor’s Prize especially). If they’re using Kirdo III tech, Control the Sandwhirl, then use Blizzard 4 (watch out for Leia, Rebel Princess) to get Vader, and then use I Have You Now to (hopefully) kill Luke. Get out Security Precautions and get Maul to space once they flip so that you can probe the HB (and thus prevent them from canceling drains). Tough matchup.<br />
<br />
QMC aliens – another tough matchup. Gotta get IR(v), Maul, and DrE ready to go. Then drop and destroy. By clearing the sites, you destroy their retrieval, which is the engine behind QMC aliens. Once you clear the sites, your ping cards (and drains at Naboo) should be enough.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading all that! This is my first deck submission on DeckTech – I hope you like it!<br />
