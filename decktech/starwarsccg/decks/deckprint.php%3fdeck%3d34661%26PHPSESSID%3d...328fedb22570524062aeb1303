Response: Actavation I though about putting in the cave puller and the two caves. I like the spaceport docking bay idea, that would help getting Vader to Luke. Thanks for looking at my deck.<br />
<br />

Ok this is a deck I played for a long time. And thought I would post it.<br />
<br />
  The goal is just to battle and battle and win enough battle to cross luke or make them losse three a turn.<br />
1st turn: Before you act. Take Emperors Power into hand. Then act, after use IAO combo to look for a docking bay. Find DS2 docking bay deploy. Then Use BHBM to deploy Emperor(V)and deploy Emperors Power. Last use Conduct to find back door or blast door contols. And Say go.<br />
<2nd Turn: You should get other docking bay and back door or controls out. Get Blizard 4 and get Vader to the Back Door.( You can use Rise My Friend to get him to Luke.)And start making them loose three and two drain. And then send Maul and Dr.E on a killing spree.<br />
<br />
<br />
When loosing force you always want to loose your Tech Mo&#39;r&#39;s They are what makes this deck allsome. Him and Tauntaun skull is a great combo with maul and Dr.E and I have you now and don&#39;t forget you can loose top card of reserve to add a destiny. I have came down before with Maul and Dr.E and swong twice opertated and added 6 to my total power and drawn 4 destiny at 6 each. No bad I think. <br />
<br />
But let me know if you all think of anything to add or take out of it. And Thanks for reading this.<br />
