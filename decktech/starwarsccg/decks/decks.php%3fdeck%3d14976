<br />
<B>UPDATE</b>: Okay, dueling isn&#8217;t nearly as effective as it was before RII simply because of WYS. Against WYS, Ben will very rarely hit the table, and Luke will either hide in a Patrol Craft or they will just cancel VO with Run Luke, Run. I&#8217;m not about to devote 6 cards when WYS is one of the most popular decks in existence. That&#8217;s just silly. If all you see is mains and no one plays WYS in your area, then by all means play a dueler.<br />
<br />
Many of you are partial to the idea of removing a Masterful Move. I would advise against this for a few reasons. One, it is key to making HoloNet Transmission work so consistently. Rarely will Visage be canceled, unless your opponent gets a OOC&TT (or TT) in their opening hand. Secondly, it useful for pulling Visage, which is then conveniently tracked through Janus or OAP. It also saves me from burning Twi&#8217;leks to find a backup Visage, when oftentimes the Twi&#8217;lek is needed for something else. Lastly, it is a very easily tracked SIX. There are no other DS trackable sixes that can be played at any time without certain cards out (that I can think of). Sometimes a five just won&#8217;t cut it. <br />
<br />
4/12 - I updated a few things, particularly the matchups section. Hope it helps. <br />
<br />
4/18 - I just wanted to address WYS. John Sneed, my opponent in the finals at States, handed my WYS its only tournament loss EVER with a deck very similar to this. And I had Jedi Luke and an OCC/TT in my opening hand. Most WYS decks rely heavily on controlling the Tatooine system. I rarely fail to take control of the system, and stop Menace Fades and use Battle Plan to MY advantage. Also, Celebration is negated, and SSPFT/SP greatly hinders Harvest. Palace Raiders require caution, but all you must do is keep Visage working and keep a steady drain going (recall that Chiraneau will be at Tatooine, giving me a drain of 3 there alone). If you can cause about 6-7 cards a turn to hit their lost pile each turn, they have no chance. They can only try to battle you to stop the damage, and by that point, I&#8217;ll have tracked and will use my tricks to give me the advantage (Command/Guri will own space). There are so many things that happen and even go wrong, but trust me, there is more than enough stuff in here to maintain on the ground and in space. Sometimes it just requires some skill. Monnok owns Palace Raiders, BTW. <br />
<br />
4/29 - Many of you are concerned about German Beatdown WYS. And you should be, because it is very problematic for this deck, enough so to cause me to change a few cards. What did I add? Two Battle Deployments. You have to play cautiously in this matchup. In the early game, STAY OFF OF TATOOINE! Drain at your docking bays and keep Visage going with HoloNet and backups. Draw until you can assemble your space. Deploy the Chimaera, Thrawn and Guri (I also added a second copy of her) to Tatooine, but don&#8217;t deploy Chiraneau if you suspect they will have Admiral&#8217;s Orders (most do). Deploy Battle Deployment. Now, it will stay out because of Thrawn&#8217;s text, which won&#8217;t work if Chiraneau is out. Now move your characters to Tatooine to drain and contest them. They won&#8217;t be able to drop a beatdown, and you will have the upper hand in drains/damage. Also, back up the Chimaera with other ships to cushion against Darklighter Spin. It&#8217;s a hard matchup, but can be won easily with skill. <br />
<br />
Also, someone mentioned something about Tarkin being useless. NO! Fallen Portal is a bane of this deck, and Tarkin is the best Portal defense out there short of Sense. DO NOT REMOVE TARKIN if anyone plays Hidden Mains in your area! <br />
<B>END UPDATE</b><br />
<br />
This is the style of Hunt Down you should be playing. I worked with Hunt Down forever after Reflections 2, and discovered Imperial Command is the way to go if you want to meet success against WYS. This deck beats almost anything thrown at it. Through tracking, it can own virtually anything on the ground. In space, it is almost uncontested by any conventional deck. <br />

<br />
<b><u>CARD EXPLANATIONS/TECH AND TRICKS</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>HoloNet Transmission</i> - This card defends against the primary Hunt Down defense of most decks - Out Of Commission & Transmission Terminated. <i>Why not just use This Is Some Rescue for the better destiny?</i> For several reasons. First, HoloNet can be pulled with Masterful Move, so it is much more consistent than TISR. Secondly, HoloNet has a very useful secondary function of pulling Imperials from the Used Pile. This is insanely good at times. Lastly, I&#8217;ve noticed that some are still using the original Transmission Terminated to circumvent TISR, but HoloNet will cancel either one. <br />
<br />
<i>Chimaera x2</i> - The Chimaera is the key to my space package. With three Commands floating in the deck, I will consistently find Thrawn by the time he is needed. Thrawn makes the Chimaera immune to attrition <6, and if Command or Guri limits their number of destinies to one, they have to draw a six to touch me with attrition. <br />
<br />
<i>Secret Plans and SSPFT</i> - Can you name one major LS deck that doesn&#8217;t retrieve Force? Harvest is everywhere, Edges are still popular, and there is always random crap floating around, like OMDH, Noble Sacrifice, and Kessel Run. The combination of these two cards pretty much shuts most any retrieval down. SSPFT also is useful if they try to run away from the Chimaera. <br />
<br />
<i>I Have You Now</i> - My typical ground strategy is to get Vader/Tarkin at one docking bay, and Palapatine and a crony or two to the other. Crush stops any kind of multiple destiny attack and Clash Of Sabers. With I Have You Now and the limited character removal, I can maintain a potent ground force. Also, if Janus is on table, I can form an infinite tracking loop with it by pulling it with Crush each turn and putting it back with Janus. <br />
<br />
<i>Prince Xizor</i> - He is mostly used as a support character. He is very useful in stopping little chumps that like to invade the Executor because of his gametext that stops destiny. Due to the Objective, they won&#8217;t be able to drain you with any LS character of ability 6 or more, and typically they won&#8217;t have more than a few characters there to reach six ability, so Xizor is perfect to take them out and stop the drains. Also is useful to hold a third site if the need arises. <br />
<br />
<i>Force Lightning</i> - The Emperor&#8217;s ability to pull this card each turn is money and can be abused. 99% of the time, there is another character present with him, so just play it Used on anyone with him at the end of any turn and track it next turn. <br />
<br />
<i>No Escape</i> - This card&#8217;s ability to retrieve the top card of your lost pile can be used to your advantage. My opponent in the final, John Sneed, painfully demonstrated this to me. I played OOC/TT on his Visage first turn and it was lost. He deployed Vader to flip, then dropped No Escape to retrieve the Visage into hand and redeployed it, making my OCC/TT worthless. This also works very well with cards like Evader & Monnok, Sniper & Dark Strike, and You Are Beaten. <br />
<br />
<i>Sim Aloo</i> - Dude is total money. I use him every turn he&#8217;s out usually. He can manipulate any destiny draw, including Fallen Portal and Sense/Alter (works so well with the +4 from the Objective). He also can screw up the opponent&#8217;s tracking, especially useful against On The Edge. Also adds a destiny with Empy, giving me four destinies if Luke decides he wants a piece of daddy&#8217;s pimp (ability for one, I Have You Now for the other two). <br />
<br />
<b><u>CARDS I WANT TO ADD</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>Battle Deployment</i> - This card lays the smackdown on WYS, especially Palace Raider variants. Also screws X-Wing decks with the power -2 unless a capital and starfighter present. <br />
<br />
<i>Come Here You Big Coward!</i> - This is a solid defense card, and it is very useful in preventing the opponent from draining at the Executor sites. <br />
<br />
<i>Resistance</i> - Another defensive card, helps against EBO (which this consistently beats anyway), and Odds. Might be a good add if you expect some sort of heavy spread-and-drain deck. <br />
<br />
<i>Second Guri</i> - Chimaera + Thrawn + Guri + Imperial Command = I own space. Three destinies for me, only one for them, and they must draw a six to affect me with attrition. If you track first, there&#8217;s no hope for them. <br />
<br />
<i>Blast Door Controls</i> - Yet another defensive card. Stops Barriers, Narrow Escape, and Blast The Door, Kid!. Good against runaway decks like Avatar QMC and Speed Profit (I doubt you&#8217;ll see this, but you never know). <br />
<br />
<i>Point Man</i> - I&#8217;ve found that Order To Engage can be a nasty card, and this would have made many of my games at States much easier. <br />
<br />
<i>Second Evader & Monnok</i> - Monnok is just so good in the current environment. With the ability to pull it from Reserve deck, you can keep so many decks in check for the first few turns, which nicely accomodates this deck&#8217;s tremendous speed. I&#8217;d probably trade this for Xizor if I were expecting any kind of swarm deck. Hell, if you know your meta very well, then you have at least a vague idea of how people in your area generally construct decks, thus you know if you can expect to play against decks with multiple copies of certain cards. Use your judgment.  <br />
<br />
I&#8217;m sure there are a few more, but those are the ones I am primarily concerned with. <br />
<br />
<b><u>MATCHUPS</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Vs. WYS</b><br />
Try to get your Thrawn/Chimaera/Command combo to the Tatooine system as quick as possible. They won&#8217;t last very long with Commands and Guri stopping the multiple destinies. Lateral Damage stops Dash. Distribute your ground crews to Tatooine. If they deploy the Spaceport Docking Bay, get No Escape down as fast you can and deploy everyone there, even your pilots because you can shuttle them up to the Chimaera. It&#8217;s nice when Vader and Tarkin come down for only 4 Force. Tarkin is useful to cancel Fallen Portal destiny and the multiple battle destinies, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s two copies of him. If you own space, you should own this game. Against Raider swarms, use the Monnok to keep them in check early, which can prevent an early flip and allow you to continue to activate ridiculous amounts of Force. If they flip and you are starved for Force, No Escape can be a helluva good way to get stuff on the table. If you still want more to handle WYS, I&#8217;d suggest Battle Deployment, which not only makes their ground forces pathetically weak, but also takes I&#8217;ll Take The Leader off the table, thus stopping any boosted drains and immunity. Look in the updates section for strategy against Beatdown WYS (ala Falke and Winkelhaus). <br />
<br />
<b>Vs. Mains (Hidden, TR, MWYHL, QMC, One-Turn Kill, whatever)</b><br />
This deck can handle pretty much any version of mains, but you <i>must</i> track to win. Cards like Sniper/Dark Strike, I Have You Now and YAB (which also can be used defensively) are pivotal. This is the game where the No Escape trick is usually the most useful. Refrain from deploying terribly early unless they commit elsewhere, although, you still want to get Vader out as soon as possible. Usually you want them to attack to avoid Fallen Portal (unless Tarkin is around). Don&#8217;t completely avoid battling them, but you need to be a little cautious. You can laugh at the one-turn kill decks because of Crush. Don&#8217;t go to space unless you have OAP, then wait for them to try their crap, play OAP (to get around DTF/FA), and just spin a Command after they&#8217;re done playing their adders to make them cry. Try to make the Monnok useful, too. Most Mains decks run plenty of multiples, like Mains, Portals, Edges, and trackable destinies.<br />
<br />
<b>Vs. EBO/HB Space</b><br />
EBO is not problematic at all in most cases. I&#8217;ve played and won against EBO X-Wings several times and took down a solid Deadbolt at States. This deck&#8217;s speed puts pressure on them, often hurrying them to deploy in space prematurely, which you can use to your advantage with the Thrawn/Chimaera/Command combo and Lateral Damage. X-Wings require a little more caution. Be wary of Power Pivot. Almost always attempt to track before committing to space to help close the potential power gap and use massive attrition to annihilate them when they don&#8217;t have an Orgy Attack. Visage is a primary weapon, use HoloNet to stop them from preventing it. Most EBO decks have limited retrieval potential, so you have an inherent edge to begin with. The only way an EBOX will potentially beat you is if they get an insanely quick EBO out, and spread with X-Wings to multiple systems. You can slow them down if you have your fleet assembled, but often times they will set up before you have the necessary cards to commit to space. The best way to stop them from such a fast setup is Monnok, use it at an opportune time. A second Evader/Monnok is not a bad idea if you play in an X-Wing-heavy meta. If you need to probe against a flipping HB, get your crew assembled on the Chimaera, and move it across the galaxy, probing on each system you stop at. If you have a suspicion of a particular system, use the bounty hunter ships to probe, but watch for Barrier. Attempt to have the Chimaera in range to use as backup in a worst case scenario. <br />
<br />
<b>Vs. Scouts (TIGIH, RST, Profit)</b><br />
Against There Is Good In Him, almost always try to kill their activation with a quick Imperial to the Landing Platform. Because there&#8217;s five Vaders in this deck, you don&#8217;t really need to worry about the Force loss from their Objective if Vader is not escorting Luke. Vader will be down by third turn in almost every game. Choke Vader is your best friend in this game. I&#8217;d suggest changing the third Lord Vader to a third Choke Vader if you see this deck a lot (I use three Lords because he&#8217;s typically better against Mains, a deck common in my meta). Character removal is a huge advantage in this matchup. Scouts just can&#8217;t hang when you Choke, Sniper, exclude, and hit. I Have You Now will often see some use, and if you track two big destinies, you will watch many scouts bite the dust. However, you do want to exercise caution against TIGIH, you don&#8217;t want Vader to get turned because of a few irresponsible battles on your part. Fallen Portal and Insertion Planning can make all the difference in the world, you need to be somewhat careful. But don&#8217;t hestitate if you have the tools to take it to them. Space won&#8217;t be of much concern, I&#8217;d probably only commit the Chimaera and Chiraneau to Carida (or Endor if they put it out). CHYBC would be a solid add to combat this deck, as they will almost always use Blount/Cracken to stop Visage and drain you. If you find an early Emperor, and expect them to attempt an invasion of the Executor, deploy him to the Holotheatre and wait with Force Lightning. Once Luke is snagged, Visage will be a potent weapon, so try to remove Obi (and their spies at the Holotheatre) and let it wreck them. You have less to worry about against RST and Profit Scouts. This matchup will probably require a few skils to win easily, but you have the advantage on paper. <br />
<br />
That&#8217;s the majority of what you can expect to play. If you want more specific strategies for other decks not listed, d-mail me and I&#8217;ll update the strategy. <br />
<br />
Have fun with it.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Track Record:</b></u><br />
States was the final tournament I went to before Tatooine was released, so this deck was used only in that event. It went 2-1 in the swiss-style games with a close timed loss, and won twice in a 3-game Final Confrontation.<br />
