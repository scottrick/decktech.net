<br /><br />
Devonator is right, I can&#39;t Elis Amidala, but as you read you will find that capturing her is not vital. If you want the bonuses from ITTWC, you can capture and stay where you are. But, If you play like me, you could relocate to her site, Sniper her, kill everyone else, and then Elis back to the Cantina and keep draining!!! Now thats fun.<br />
<br /><br />
Take out the Ghhhk and 1 Elis( or SPD, your choice). I lean more towards keeping the probes because they are pullable, relocate during control phase, can be retrieved with AAA(v) and retrieve 1 when they are deployed. Elis is very good and very versatile, but not if LS brings Insurrection. That limites Elis to exterior sites and my move phase. That would destroy my whole Cantina/relocate/disarmed/Sniper strategy.<br />
<br /><br />
Put in ***Rodian(v) x2 to protect your drain at Cantina from anything but Jedi Test 1. Wait, I just found out that Test 1 CANCELS now, not ignores! That even better for me!!!<br />
<br /><br />
I start draining for 4 my second turn(6 after ETE is out), and even if the average HB flips on their 2nd or 3rd turn, that&#39;s a loss of about 12-18 force right there!! <br />
<br <br />
**************NOTE*********************<br />
<br /><br />
I have 1 Phantom Menace, and no Darth Maul,YA. If I had more, they would be in here. Thanks.<br />
<br /><br />
Also, I say again that I don&#39;t feel that this is a re-post(see above). If you already reviewed the other deck I posted, I don&#39;t expect you to review again.(unless you would like to change/add something to what you said before. Some reviews on the other deck made little sence, my fault for posting two decks at the same time. Won&#39;t happen again.)Thank you!<br />
<br /><br />
*************************************************<br />
<br /><br />
Basicly the way you play this deck is to drop Maul(for free)at the DLS first turn(thats why you have 5, to make sure you get one in opening hand)with his saber(pulled with BR(v)), pull ITTWC with IWFTQM and get the Cantina with LLL(v). Move Maul to Cantina so he doesn&#39;t get hit with Sandwhirl, and start draining next turn. Use Expand the Empire on the Landing Site so You could get a max drain of 6 at the Cantina, without fear of Honor of the Jedi, huge. Also, ETE only "expands" your game text to the Cantina, not opponents, so you can drain there even if Amidala is deployed/captured. Really huge!!<br />
<br /><br />
Don&#39;t deploy Dr. E as backup for Maul right away! Wait to see if light side gives you Amidala first. I say this because you can do a lot of damage during your control phase if and when you have to move. Your Sith Probe Driods let you relocate Maul to Amidala&#39;s site during your control phase. Disarm the Jedi she may have with her, Sniper some one else, deploy Dr. Evazan and start operatin&#39;, capture Amidala and, if you are still on Tatooine, use Elis to go to Naboo.I would not do that for combat though. Instead go somewhere other than Tatooine if you can and use Bounty Hunters and such for combat if you have to. I have not played combat but I think it could be close.<br />
(Note: The Dr. E combo CAN NOT operate on Disarmed characters! Otherwise, I would use the combo)<br />
<br /><br />
With ITTWC on table and Amidala in my grasp, I can use up to 3 of their force to deploy my dudes and their battle destinies are -1. ITTWC gives me added bonuses when I have Amidala at a non-Tatooine site, such as; LS force drains at Tat. sites -1, and I can shuffle their reserve deck once every turn!<br />
<br /><br />
With that said, capuring Amidala and leaving Tatooine ARE NOT vital to the decks proformance. It is just an easy way to get added bonuses from ITTWC. If you want, you can stay at(or go back to)the Cantina and drain away. If you do decide to stay at Cantina you can deploy Security Precautions (v)[props to Shewski for that one] there to help out with activation, and stops Revolution at the DLS.<br />
<br /<br />
(NOTE: SP(v) states that deploy costs may not be modified at same sites. Maul deploys FREE to the DLS. FREE is an unmodifiable value so I am uneffected by this text.) <br />
<br /><br />
HB and Jedi test 1 can stop this easy enough, but not before you cause some damage with it first.<br />
<br /><br />
This deck is very reactive, meaning it is made to counter-act what ever the light side it trying to do. That means a step-by-step strategy is almost impossable, but I will tell you as much about how it works as I can. It can drain very well, even without bonuses(a minimum of 6 a turn with just your sites) and has great potential for battles. I can even hold a system to get around Battle Plan(more than 1 system is pushing it though). This deck can do this because it is so versatile. <br />
<br /><br />
The tech for non-combo Dr. Evazan/Disarmed is just a sample of how this deck works. If you look, most of the stuff in here basicly lets you reduce the number of light side characters you will have to fight, or at least limits their abilities. Iggy and Snoova capture people. Arica can be droped just to take out someone with her game text, Sniper, Disarmed, Naver Yalnal or all four!!! Prince Xixor-Guri-and your other droids can hold WYS at bay almost by themselves(see below), 4-Lom cancels gametext of EPPs, You Are Beaten excludes, Sniper and Nevar Yalnal can take out spies while yours run wild, ect. Just play smart.<br />
<br /><br />
Use your retrival wisely. No Escape and the Sith Probes all retrieve 1 force when they are deployed. Play lost interrupts(like You are Beaten, Set for Stun, Nevar Yalnal and Sniper) during your control/deploy phase so you can deploy NE or a SPD and retrieve it! Also AAA(v) and First Strike let you retrieve when you initiate. Get back your Disarmed(after Dr. E operates) and such with First Strike, and your long lost pals with AAA(v). <br />
<br /><br />
And that is basicly how the deck works. I find that cards that limit the light sides options work better than characters that try to overpower them. Think of it this way, a look at WYS for example. That LS deck uses smugglers with extra destinies on ground and in air to win. To battle them on the ground you can deploy Guri, Iggy, and 4-Lom to their sites a full turn or two before you are ready to battle them. They can&#39;t be beaten down, they&#39;re all droids, and most people don&#39;t play the Artoo/Threepo combo anymore. The only thing they would have to worry about is SATM, and 4-Lom/Iggy can Disarm/Sniper anyone before they can pull that off(although they can&#39;t use Sniper to kill, Iggy can capture and 4-Lom can "erase" the weapon funtion of an EPP). Just let them sit there &#39;till you&#39;re ready to strike. When you do hit them, Xizor and Guri stop the destiny at one site, while the rest can be teamed up with Snoova, P-59, Vader or whatever. You can even play Set For Stun on Chewie to really be a basterd. SfS can also be a god send for their space package too. Use it with Zuckuss before you initiate to make sure his game text works. Then you can retrieve it with First Strike after you initiate the battle. You can also use SfS to stop Kessel Runs. Just target the same pilot before he makes it back to Kessel. Think about it. <br />
<br /<br />
Other cards that would work well with this type of strategy, if they were in here, would be:<br />
<br /><br />
Dioxis<br />
The Circle is now Complete<br />
Darth Sid<br />
Mostly armless<br />
Maul Strikes(I use IHYN for Vader and Maul)<br />
Barrier(take out AAA(v) first)<br />
etc.<br />
<br /><br />
so feel free to experiment. Have fun with it!<br />
<br /><br />
Thanks for reading. Any Questions, D-mail me and I&#39;ll help you out. Peace, I&#39;m out!<br />
