*********************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the general strategy for playing this deck.<br />
<br />
1) The default starting effects are IAO Combo, Establish Control (v), and either Crush The Rebellion, Ability, Ability, Ability (v), or Crossfire (v).<br />
<br />
2) Deploy Vader or Blizzard 4 right away to one of your docking bays or one of the opponents battlegrounds.  You can do this first turn if the LS gives you two icons, which is like 90% of the time.  Otherwise, just do it turn two.<br />
<br />
3) Keep Vader safe and get the damage going with Visage.<br />
<br />
4) Use Maul, Mara, P-59, etc. to beat down on the opponents ground forces.  Use ZIMH, 4-LOM, and Boba, BH to disrupt the opponents space forces.<br />
<br />
5) Win via force drains, battle damage, Visage, and sometimes Search and Destroy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty simple, huh.  Before I go into more detail about specific match-ups, be aware that in what follows, I assume that you draw a Vader or Blizzard 4 in your opening hand.  If you dont, check to see if youve activated one when you grab a docking bay first turn.  If you did activate one, just draw into him.  If you didnt, use your first turn force as you feel necessary and try again next turn.  Usually, this means you will deploy somebody to a docking bay to up your generation with Establish Control.  Also, I assumed that the LS player didnt start Your Insight Serves You Well or Honor Of The Jedi.  If you think that they will be starting one of those cards, it would probably be prudent to switch out one of the recommended starting effects for No Escape.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speeders - Start IAO Combo, Crush The Rebellion, and either Establish Control (v) or Crossfire (v).  Its probably safest to stick Vader at one of your docking bays, so he doesnt get Ice Stormed.  Use Crossfire (v) and your I Have You Nows to break the immunity of their speeders.  If you track a six (or just get a lucky draw), P-59 can shoot down their speeders as well.  The Coward shield is your friend in this match-up.  Attack them at either the fourth marker or the Hoth system so that they only occupy one battleground.  If you kick them out of space (certainly doable with this space package since the redux slowed the deck way down), you pretty much get the win right then.  People say that this is a bad match-up for you, but Ive never had any trouble beating speeders with Hunt Down.  Your damage is just to fast for them to handle, and your disruptive attacks make them play the game on your terms.<br />
<br />
Hidden Base - Start IAO Combo, Crossfire (v), and You Cannot Hide Forever.  Get Search and Destroy with YCHF and Security Precautions with Crossfire (v).  Secure your two bg docking bays right away so you can set-up S&D.  If they go for a big drain at Kessel or Coruscant, use Fanfare to get Enter The Bureaucrat to stop those shenanigans.  Maul in his Infiltrator with Security Precautions is big, but weapons will own him, so be careful.  Use ZIMH and his friends to battle when the opportunity presents itself.  You may even get to kill some of their ships using Unsalvageable in this match-up.  Damage from Visage, S&D, Security Precautions, and force drains (before they flip and after their objective goes OOP) should be able to get you the win.<br />
<br />
Profit - Start IAO Combo, Establish Control (v), and Crush The Rebellion.  Start Mara and Dr. E Combo with their objective.  Their space package is probably small, so its probably safe to get ZIMH with 4-LOM to Fondor if you draw them early, but realize you are taking a risk.  If they havent flipped yet, I like to move all my guys from the Audience Chamber to Jabbas Palace so I can drain, and use the Coward shield to either stop the retrieval, or make them deploy and move a second character.  After they flip, you will do a lot of battling on the ground.  They have a lot of tricks in their deck, but so do you (Stunning Leader, Weapon Levitation, I Have You Now, Vaders Anger, etc.).  If you can keep Han dead, they do almost no damage to you.  If they try to go off Tatooine to drain, Luke, Luuuuke them.<br />
<br />
MWYHL - When they show you their objective, you have the option of not starting the Meditation Chamber if you fear Obi-Wans Apparition.  If their starting interrupt is The Signal (v), start No Escape so Honor OTJ doesnt hose you.  Your other starting effects should probably be IAO Combo and Your Insight Serves You Well.  Early game, you want to fortify both of your docking bays and set-up Search and Destroy.  Hopefully, Visage, S&D, and your drains will cause enough damage before they flip that they wont be able to recover.  Enter the Bureaucrat on Kessel is good if they decide to go there.  You also have the option in this match-up to load up ZIMH or the Sith Inflitrator at Fondor, fly over to Dagobah, land, and disrupt their training.<br />
<br />
MBO - Start IAO Combo, YCHF, and Establish Control.  First turn, grab the blockage flagship docking bay, but consider yourself for warned.  If you activated both your BF:DB and your executor docking bay, youll have to play your death star docking bay, which will cost you dearly when the Death Star blows.  So, grab the BF:DB first turn, and then dont search for another DB until after the blow.  Deploy someone (hopefully Vader) to the Yavin 4 DB first turn, someone to the BF:DB second turn, and set-up Search and Destroy.  Then, start to invade their Yavin sites for the big juicy drains of two.  Youll take 14 damage from the Death Star, but between Visage, S&D and drains, you should have caused at least 13 damage to them by the end of their third turn.  After they flip, remember that they cant drain where Luke is, and you can Bureaucrat one of their systems.  Cloaked Maul and Resistance reduce drains of three to drains of two.  Also, a lot of MBOs shuttle the character they use to flip up to a capital.  So, if you get Luke, Luuuuke early, you can target one of their generals on Yavin, and when they shuttle up, Luke Luuuke keeps working.  Their lack of any power on the ground makes this an easy match-up.<br />
<br />
WHAP - Start Establish Control (v), Crossfire (v), and Ability, Ability, Ability (v).  Deploy someone to the Throne Room right away (hopefully Vader).  Use Crossfire to add a destiny early, since Crossfire becomes pretty worthless after they flip.  ZIMH to Fondor early is key, because WHAP space is absolutely terrible.  If you can cause them overflow in two or three battles before they flip, you can probably win the damage race.  They really dont have enough power to hold both the Throne Room and the Hallway or Courtyard, so give them a beat down if they make the mistake of trying to spread to two sites.  If necessary, Luke Luuuuke and Bureaucrat can further reduce their drains when the game turns into a damage race.  Usually, the player more experienced in this match-up will be the winner.  <br />
<br />
WYS - Start IAO Combo, Establish Control (v), and Crush The Rebellion.  First turn Vader to either the Cantina (for the force drain) or their docking bay (for the EC generation) is good.  They will choke your generation, but youll also be choking them.  Choke Vader, P-59, Maul, The Emperor (v), and Mara should make short work of their ground characters in direct confrontations, and the best the LS player can hope for is to play cat-and-mouse with you on the ground.  If you have character removal (DLOTS, EPP Emperor, Weapons and Dr. E Combo) and are playing a standard WYS (CA WYS, Palace Raiders) you can spread relatively thin on Tatooine without fear of things going catastrophically bad.  If you suspect you are playing against a German Win-The-Game-In-One-Battle deck, its a better idea to consolidate your forces.  Its probably not a good idea to go to space, since Legendary Starfighter will ruin your day if they get it off.  Im not going to say never go to space; but think long and hard about it before you do.  Their Kessel drain can be handled by Ultimatum, a cloaked Maul, or Enter The Bureaucrat (after you think theyve exhausted their Control & Tunnel Visions).   Keep up the pressure with Visage, the Cantina drain, and possibly Search & Destroy.  Put out your Do They Have A Code Clearance? shield early in the game, since they are probably playing On The Edge, and you want to stack it to mess with their Luke (v) retrieval.  Like the WHAP match-up, the more experience player will probably be the winner here.  <br />
<br />
Lightsaber Combat - Start Ability, Ability, Ability (v), IAO Combo, and Establish Control (v).  Pull all the zeroes out of your deck right away.  You want Darth Sidious out as soon as possible, so always look for him when youre pulling stuff from your deck.  You can make a quick game out of this if Sidious puts a couple of their Jedi out of play, but you can win without him.  There really isnt any advantage to deploying first (other than deploying Sidious to your Holotheatre), so you might as well let the LS player deploy their Jedi first.  Once they have a Jedi out, try and drop a beat squad on him, even though they will probably stop the battle somehow.  If you dont kill their Jedi, move your guys away.  You always want to make the LS come to you to combat, as opposed to letting them combat and move away.  They cant drain, and you get to attempt to battle them during your turn.  Your average destiny is just as high as theirs, so you have a 50/50 chance of winning the early lightsaber combats.  Theyre going to start tracking their high destiny for combat early, so you need to do the same.  Vaders Anger (v) can be used to get rid of an annoying Jedi (Mace and Qui-Gon JM fit the bill).  Eventually, a few battles will get past their evasion, and you need to make the most of these.  Causing overflow and removing their characters from table will get you a hard-fought win.<br />
<br />
TRM - Ugh.  This is like the dumbest match-up out there.  The game is basically decided by your opening hands, and the destiny draws in the first few battles in the game (which happen before either player gets any tracking set-up).  You get to see their starting effects before you choose yours, so start No Escape if they start Your Insight Serves You Well.  IAO Combo and Establish Control are also good to start to help out against the choke.  If you dont have to start No Escape, start either Crossfire (v) (to get Security Precautions or WTO,AOT) or Crush The Rebellion (to get I Have You Nows, stop Clash of Sabers, and limit destiny draws).  The game plan is to hide at the Ex: DB for a turn or two for the generation from Establish Control (v).  Once youve got a pretty good force set-up, head out to the BF: DB, possibly leaving someone behind to keep generation coming (especially if youve got stunning leader or other evasion available).  Now you will fight at the DB over and over again.  If you do better than the LS player in these battles, you will win.  If you do worse, they will win.  Simple as that.  Space is pretty unimportant in this match-up.  You probably dont want to go to space first unless you seem them topdeck multiple ships.  You can use cloaked Maul and Bureaucrat to limit their drains if you dont feel like battling in space.  If an opportunity presents itself though, go ahead and take the battle to the air.  Just watch-out for the Sprial, and use First Strike to prevent them from using interrupt shenanigans.<br />
<br />
Careful Planning Mains - People still play this after the redux?  I suppose the City Outskirt - Toshe Station deck is the best version of this, so lets talk about that one.  Start IAO Combo, Establish Control (v), and either Crossfire (v) or Crush The Rebellion.  They dont get enough force to deploy a Jedi and move to Toche Station unless you give them pulls with Drop!  Maintain a presence at Toshe Station to stop them from getting the activation bonus.  Watch out for the major beatdown, but realize that theyll probably need to save up force for a couple of turns to drop enough to cause you problems.  Your constant attacks and Visage damage should disrupt them enough that their game plan will go kaput, and they die a slow death.<br />
<br />
TIGIH - Start IAO Combo, Establish Control (v), and either Crush or Crossfire.  If you can put an imperial down first turn to the Endor: DB (Emperor, or Vader or Mara if they are podracing) you will choke them really hard next turn.  In any event, you want to grab Luke with Vader, and pile all your guys to one of your docking bays.  You want to have enough guys at the bay so that the LS player will be in a world of hurt when they come to attack.  Depending on how much force they are activating, you&#39;ll probably be able to spread to a second docking bay.  This is one match-up where Wipe Them Out could be really big.  Their space package is probably as small as yours, so if you don&#39;t need to reinforce Vader some turn, you might want to go to space.  If you don&#39;t let them beat you in battles, your plink drains and Visage will eventually do them in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
<br />
Enter The Bureaucrat - As match-ups section showed, this card is really helps you win against big drain decks.  But Brian, you might say, Everyone will just cancel this with control.  Yes, I am aware that control cancels Bureaucrat, and that A LOT of decks play control.  So, Ill let you in on a secret.  In match-ups where you expect the LS to be playing Controls or Control combos (WHAP, WYS, MBO, TRM), DONT PLAY Bureaucrat until youve either grabbed control or until the controls are buried in the LS players lost pile, and that they cant get them back easily (WHAP, WYS).  This isnt really much of a problem since you are usually battling them constantly in the early and middle game, and it isnt until late game that things turn into a drain race.<br />
<br />
Force Field, Weapon Levitation, and Wipe Them Out, All Of Them (v) - These three cards protect your dudes from weapons fire, which is key, since a living Vader is better than a dead one.  WTO, AOT is like the worst of these three cards though, since you have six characters who also get hurt by the -2 text.  In addition, you will hardly ever get to retrieve or activate since TRM just changed two or three random twixes to two or three Yavin 4 twixes. <br />
<br />
Unsalvageable - Cancels Out of Commission & Transmission Terminated, both functions of which hurt this deck.  Also cancels the annoying Power Pivot and Hyper Escape.  Finally, lets you kill a ship if your attrition just kills the pilot.  The only better bullet in this deck is Cold Feet (v).<br />
<br />
<br />
61st Card<br />
<br />
Imperial Decree (v) - I had Decree (v) in my deck until a few hours before MN States when I switched it out for Crush The Rebellion.  My logic was this; all the match-ups where the force loss reduction text would be useful (Profit, MBO, WHAP, Speeders) are winnable without Decree so I might as well play with something more useful.  Also, the activation text is really bad.  Versus throne room, I can activate seven off my own icons, or lose a force to activate ten.  Talk about lose-lose.<br />
<br />
Evader & Monnok or Evader - It looks like Revolution is making a comeback, which could be bad news for a deck starting two non-battlegrounds.  So, its probably a good idea to add in the pullable Revo-canceller.  The destiny-conscious might want to go with the destiny 4 non-combo, but Im willing to stand the destiny 2 for the additional Monnok text.<br />
<br />
Endor Shield (v) and Grand Moff Tarkin - This is such a good combo for Hunt Down.  Startable effect that hurts people who want to use the Endor system.  Pullable character that can set-up major beatdowns, or can be used to cut off TIGIHs generation or add to yours via Establish Control.<br />
<br />
JQuille (v) - Causing direct damage for no real reason is good.  Potentially allowing you to get off a beat down versus Speeders or EBO is good as well.  Im tempted to take out Sidious for JQuille, since I never seem to get to use Sidious, and when I do, Escape Pod (v) ruins my fun.<br />
<br />
Control & Set For Stun  Set For Stun is good for setting up beat downs, and combines well with Unsalvageable.  Control is good for canceling big drains and immediate effects like Ice Storm, Sandwhirl, and Imperial Atrocity (v).<br />
<br />
More Force Fields - Force field is so good, Id play three if I had room.<br />
<br />
<br />
