<br />
take a look at a silly droid called asp-707, your vehicles deploy - 1! rebel snowspeeders deploy for free now! useing maneuvering flaps non V and incom corporation, your speeders are power 5 and deploy for 1 or free! and make power 6 and ammune, if you use attack pattern delta!! <br />
<br />
cal alder is not that great of a card but if you deploy a wrist comlink on him and he is pullable by crix, now all your beefy free speeders can move to a battle! and pound on the dark side! <br />
<br />
incom engineer makes all your destenys +2 and sens almost every desteny in the deck is 3 it now becomes a 5! or higher! <br />
<br />
wokling can pull incom corporation and then you can place it out of play to get back a card that you may really need! <br />
<br />
your force activation in this deck is totaly crazy!! 8 on the first turn and how ever many force icons the dark side give you! <br />
<br />
basicly what this deck dose is, reacting super speeders that deploy for free and force drain for a lot!! + when you flip you can pull any card into hand and stop alot of direct damig! <br />
<br />
this deck has not lost a game yet even to my deal the beat deck! if you come to hoth you die! if you dont come to hoth you die! no other way! <br />
<br />
i know there are a few other cards out there that can make this deck better but not totaly sure what they are. i really dont like the maching speeder pilot decks so i made a better one that is alot more flexable. please give me any ideas that would make this deck better. <br />
<br />
i know its unfair but hey, i like to win and i know this deck dose just that!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
