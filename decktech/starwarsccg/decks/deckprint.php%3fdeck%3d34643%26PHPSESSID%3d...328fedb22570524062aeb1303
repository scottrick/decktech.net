<br />
This deck is a monster. It has incredible staying power over the long run and can consistently dominate against all the top dark side decks out there.<br />
<br />
I just know that someone out there is going to tell me that I should make space for Goo Nee Tay and maybe possibly drop one of the Edge’s, Impressives or SATM & BPs or some other rubbish. The thing is, I like this deck the way it is. I have fine tuned it to play the way I want it to. It compliments my style extremely well and in my hands it feels more like a delicate instrument then a stack of cards. Of course, there is always room for improvement, no matter what the deck and if anybody can give me good constructive reasons for making changes (meaning a better reason then, “You should add card X,Y and Z because they are good), I will of course take it into consideration. <br />
<br />
In tournament play, it is 8-1 to date. This may not seem impressive but once I take into consideration all the friendly games I played with it, it is closer to 45-2. Its only loss was to a New Age Walker deck and the other was a game that I was playing while heavily under the influence of booze and narcotics. As you can imagine, the pot and beer ended up inhibiting my ability to make any sort of rational decision and react to my opponent accordingly. Who woulda thought? Anyway, I get bored of playing the same deck for too long so I have decided to shelf this one for a while and move on to something else. That’s why it has not made very many appearances at tournaments. But, with its excellent showing at the recent MI Open I decided to post it and let others take a look.<br />
<br />
To truly be good with a deck, you must be one with a deck. I know what every card on the above list does from memory and I always know where all my cards are in my life force at all times. When I hold this deck in my hands I am one with it. That is the truth. If you really want to see what this deck is capable of, build it and play it for a couple months until you become one with it and you will understand.<br />
<br />
Starting<br />
I always start Civil Disorder v and Seeking an Audience v. Seeking an Audience is a great card. It gets me five of my characters and I can place it out of play to take ANY character into hand from lost pile. This is huge late game when characters are in short supply or when you really need that Boushh back to block a drain. Depending on what dark starts, use either Colo or Sando. Many dark side players will not start either card but will pack Sando just to eat you Colo at their leisure. Fine, I say, let em. I have practiced playing without Colo enough so that I am very comfortable doing so. If the dark side is not packing Sando, then more power to you. Get Threepio down on your first turn, provided you didn’t activate him. Start using him to cycle through your deck. With, Threepio, Colo and the high destiny used interrupts in the deck, you will be able to cycle through your deck super fast. Pay attention to what your opponent is doing and get those cards that will help you counter their strategy. Try to get the Jedi Chamber out for activation and hold on to the Battle Plains until you are ready to drain there. If you are playing a Scum deck then slap A Gift on Artoo. Threepio is far too valuable to lose to a Hutt Smooch. Artoo on the other hand, is expendable. Once A Gift has been deployed, try to have a Sense in your hand and the grabber shield out to grab the Smooch. Protect A Gift as best as you can. If the Smooch does go through or Artoo is lost some other way, retrieve it with an Edge, track it back to the top and grab it with Threepio. Now slap it on him and away you go! I have done this more times than you would believe! <br />
<br />
Mid Game<br />
By now you should have a good idea where all your cards are in your life force and you should have a number of useful cards in your hand. If your opponent has invaded Tatooine like a mad man, then deploy the Battle Plains and drain away letting your spies block their drains. If they have a number of battleground sites on the table, then invade them instead of going to the battle plains. Savrip will help you keep your characters on the table but watch out for an Alter or Masterful Move. This is why there are two Houjixes in the deck. This is also why there are two Savrips. I have practiced a lot without using Savrip and I strongly feel that anyone who relies on it to win the game will lose. Get used to playing without it on the table and you will be better for it. If they are playing a space deck, go ahead and free Han after you have lost a couple cards and spread out a bit to start applying direct damage and drains. Don’t be afraid to go to space. With Threepio and two Control & Tunnel Visions in the deck, it is a lot easier than you think to get Home One, Bright Hope, Corran and Wedge into hand. Seeking will also let you deploy Artoo from your reserve, allowing you to cancel three battle destinies a turn. Play smart though. Sometimes it is more important to simply maintain a space presence then to dominate. If it appears that they have little or no space whatsoever, then go to Kessel with Home One and Bright Hope along with some forfeit. You should also be setting up some sixes to be used with On the Edge.<br />
<br />
Late Game<br />
Use those tracked sixes to retrieve some force with On the Edge. Try to free Han at this point for more retrieval if that option is available. Even bigger bonus if you can get Flash v looped with Threepio. All this retrieval should give you the advantage needed to win. Many times I have turned a defeat into a victory by retrieving 10-15 force over 2 turns.<br />
If you are not winning by this point then it is not the decks fault.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, to effectively play this deck or any other deck it is necessary to be absolutely familiar with what each cards does. To this end…<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
While most of the cards are self explanatory, I’m going to go over some of them anyway because I feel like it. <br />
<br />
Boushh: I find this Leia to be the most useful and versatile. She is key in defeating Walkers, slowing down the Maul deck, canceling Visage, or just blocking big drains in general. She is an excellent tool in slowing down your opponent’s ability to damage you on the ground. Some people will suggest using Ref 3 Leia to help against Scum, but any good Scum deck should have at least two droids to negate her game text (4-Lom, IG-88 or P-59).<br />
<br />
Yoda: With his forfeit nine, he is amazing with Savrip.<br />
<br />
Chewie, Protector v: I prefer this Chewie over any other version out there. He has an excellent deploy-forfeit ratio that allows you to get him out that much faster if your force activation is lean. Surprisingly, I have used his “While with Leia…” game text far more often then I ever would have thought. Oh, he lets you deploy Boushh as well!<br />
<br />
Houjix x 2: While I see a lot of people playing only one houjix, I like to run two. They are useful for suicide runs or simply to save your butt and with Masterful Move being a regularly played card these days, there is a good chance that your butt could use some saving if you rely on Savrip. <br />
<br />
Impressive, Most Impressive x 2: This card is awesome. There is no doubt about it. It cancels Barrier, Stunning Leader and You Are Beaten when targeting your Jedi or a battle that your Jedi is involved in. I threw it in after playing a couple games versus Hunt Down where I fell prey to the old “Stunning Leader Qui-Gon when he initiates battle against a lone Vader at the Death Star docking bay then come back at him with a Boba Fett, BH, 4-Lom with gun, Put All Sections on Alert, I Have You Now and enough battle destinies and power to win the game” trick. But, I quickly learned that the ability to take the first action in the weapons phase of a battle your opponent initiates is incredible powerful, even if it is once a game. Lots of people like to team up Dr. Evazan & Ponda Baba with EPP Maul or EPP Vader for clearing sites. Impressive, Most Impressive v lets you guarantee that one of those two characters will not be there on your turn, affording you the chance to strike back with a beat down. But this card can be the most devastating when is combined with…<br />
<br />
Sorry About the Mess & Blaster Pro x 2: When used in conjunction with Impressive, Most Impressive v, these two cards can turn an opponent’s beat down into your chance to gain the upper hand. Don’t believe me? Try it out. These two cards allow you to control the battle by eliminating one character before anything else happens. I find character removal to be so important during battles that I threw two of these cards in. <br />
<br />
On the Edge x 2: This is another card that usually makes it into most decks but usually not in pairs. Personally, I like retrieving force and this is a fast and effective way to do so. If you play them right and retrieve one with the other then it is even possible to play it three times. There are few things more demoralizing then watching your opponent retrieve ten force in one turn with two On the Edges. It is even worse if your opponent doesn’t grab it or pull Do They Have a Code Clearance. <br />
<br />
Savrip x 2: With Masterful Move being so popular these days, I say run two or don’t run it at all. If one gets canceled or Altered, I like having another one to throw down. <br />
<br />
<br />
Match-Ups<br />
<br />
CCT: Let me start with this match-up because everyone seems to think that it is some sort of auto-win for dark. Let me tell you, it’s NOT. I just want to make sure you all heard me. CCT IS NOT AN AUTO-WIN AGAINST PROFIT! I have played all sorts of Carbon Chamber Testing decks in an attempt to figure out why everyone says this and I have never lost to it. Not once. Everyone tells me that Profit will lose every time against CCT. Well, they are wrong. Yes, retrieving one force a turn from the objective is very helpful but it will not win the game for dark side. That is the only benefit that CCT gets from playing against Profit. Against a space based CCT, there ground power will not be as powerful as yours and with your multitude of tricks you should be able to free Han with ease at your leisure. In fact, freeing Han earlier in the game may even be beneficial because the direct damage will help in the long run. The Carbon Chamber and Battle Plains are both excellent places to drain at and combined with the direct damage, you can easily keep pace with any drains they throw at you from space. You also have enough space power that you will be able to stay up there indefinitely. If they are spread out over 3 different systems then hit them where they are weakest. If they gang up on you then move to wherever they are weakest or to an unoccupied battleground system. If they do try to gang up on you, then the amount of damage they will be causing will be limited to a few systems. As long as you can maintain a foothold in space in order to satisfy Battle Order/Plan while keeping them off the ground and will be draining for free while they are paying. If you happen to play a CCT deck that is ground based then that is fine as well. You have plenty of characters that you can use to battle it out with Civil Disorder getting more back for you and Savrip to potentially help keep your guys on the table. Use Boushh to slow their drains down and attack where they are the weakest. I will say it again: CCT IS NOT AN AUTO-WIN AGAINST PROFIT! Not even close. My Profit deck will beat any CCT deck out there. Drive, fly, hitchhike or walk up to Toronto and I will show you the error of your ways. <br />
<br />
Now that I got that out of my system…<br />
<br />
Hunt Down: I originally built this deck so that it would be able to handle HD with ease. If they start Colo, then you start Sando. Make sure to grab their Masterful Move the first time you see it. That will help you keep Savrip on the table. If they go to the Death Star Docking Bay, ignore them. You don’t want to deal with Put All Sections on Alert. Besides, they can only drain you for one there. Your drains at the Naboo: Battle Plains will hurt them a lot more. A lot of Hunt Down’s rely on Stunning Leader to control when battles occur in order to create beat downs. Impressive, Most Impressive v will take care of that problem for you. SATM&BP will help you pick apart their ground forces. Use your Houjixes for suicide runs to take out Vader. Free Han and use your two On the Edges to retrieve force and gain the advantage. If Visage is bothering you, use your spies and OOC&TT to cancel it. While this is not a guaranteed win, my Profit deck should be able to consistently defeat it, and in my hands it does.<br />
<br />
The Maul Deck: Start Sando Aqua Monster instead of Colo. RURUrURUruRuuRurur’s Bantha does not effect any cards coming off Sando. Get A Gift up and running as soon as possible on Artoo. You don’t want to risk losing Threepio to a Sniper. He is too valuable as far as cycling through your deck and setting up destinies. Move your undercover droid over if you have to in order to block drains. Use Boushh to try and slow down the drains. Try to have a Sense ready to deal with Sniper. If you have a control in your hand, go digging for Owen & Beru because they will allow you to draw battle destiny against Watto. Keep throwing your Jedi with ligthsabers and other characters at your opponents characters. If you are able to keep Savrip in play, then that will help keep those characters on the table. Civil Disorder v combined with Savrip can win you this match up. They will probably get set up before you so try to get a Houjix and some random character down to block their drains for the first turn or two if you are not ready to strike yet. This can be a close match but it is completely winnable. <br />
<br />
My Kind of Scum: In all my play testing, this was by far the hardest match up, but only as long as your opponent is good. First of all, they will invade Tatooine so fast that your head will spin. Normally that is fine because you can just ignore them and set up your drains on Naboo while shutting them down with A Gift and Boushh. Except that any half decent Scum deck should be packing Hutt Smooch to take care of A Gif and/or any other undercover spies. Knowing that, don’t use Threepio with A Gift, use Artoo. They also have more characters than you and they can keep throwing them at you on Naboo. Also, any self respecting Scum deck should also be packing Masterful Move to cancel Savrip so relying on that can be detrimental to your health. Try to Alter Scum & Villainy but the dark side should have pulled the Oppressive Enforcement shield as soon as you deployed a high ability character. Either that or be prepared for a Control. If the Scum player is not prepared to do any of this, then you should be able to hold your ground and with the 2 Edge’s you will have a better than average chance at winning. If on the other hand their Scum deck is anything like mine…good luck.<br />
<br />
Now, to tell you the truth, I don’t feel like writing anymore. This is already long enough and the tournament report that goes with it is ridiculously long. I’m not even going to check my spelling and punctuation because I just don’t care and the damn thing is too long anyway. Just play the deck for a while and you will get a feel for it. If not…then go play Agents in the Crapper.<br />
