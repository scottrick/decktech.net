<b><u>Story: </b></u><br />
<br />
This deck idea came first in spring 2003, when I found out about the broken combo Let&#39; Go Left + Advance Preparations (V) (pre-errata) + Combined Attack, and I decided to build a B-Wing HB about it.<br />
Still, there was no virtual 6 out, so no Rebel Planners (V), and I was looking for a quick way to flip (which is Romas &#39;Lock&#39; Navender (V), so Strike Planning starting with Rieekan (V)). However, Rieekan (V) was no pilot, so he couldn&#39;t deploy on a B-Wing bomber, so I looked on the &quot;Y-Wing&quot; possibility, which turned into a &quot;spread and drain&quot; deck.<br />
You know the story: I decided not to play this cheese B-Wing HB deck for States 2003, and chose the fun deck instead (MBO), and now we have MBO all around the world. But this HB possibility was there.<br />
Now, one year ago, MBO is even more brutal (the deck allowed me to place in finals at Europeans 2004), but Rebel Planners (V) made HB come again on top.<br />
So here is it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Strategy: </b></u><br />
<br />
This is basic spread & drain HB. It is however quicker than any you could have seen, since it deploys 3 (can be even 4 with Rieekan (V) who gets Hoth) system per turn (objective, Rebel Planners (V), and Romas &#39;Lock&#39; Navender (V)).<br />
Usually indeed you should flip turn 2, albeit you can wait turn 3 if you want.<br />
Then, spread with one Y-Wing at each system (they are cheap, only 1 force) and drain for a ton.<br />
Battle Order is NOT an issue, thanks to some uber-tech in the deck, basically it&#39;s all in the card This Is No Cave. More on this later.<br />
While you&#39;re draining for a ton, the opponent will try to jump at you and kill you. He will also try to probe. But you have all the cards to make him cry for it. Which will turn into a next turn of drains, with the opponent with even fewer cards in hand and life force. Before draining him out, you can retrieve all your lost pile with All Wings Report In and seal the game with a Full Win of about +25 / +30 (do not expect more: this deck deploys a lot on table).<br />
<br />
Before getting onto the deck usual set-up, you have to understand that your shield choice will be made upon the opponent&#39;s deck. Usually the deck plays:<br />
<I>A Tragedy Has Occurred <br />
Do Or Do Not</I><br />
<br />
the last shield is usually either<br />
<I>Ultimatum</I><br />
OR<br />
<I>Your Insight Serves You Well</I><br />
<br />
Ultimatum if you&#39;re facing a deck with potential &quot;drain 3 or more&quot; that you won&#39;t be able in any manner to cancel.<br />
Your Insight Serves You Well if you fear inserts or any first turn Scanning Crew. Usually the later is to be chosen on the former, because HB does already a good job at cancelling drains with Rebel Planners (V) out. So my set-up will be about using Your Insight Serves You Well, but bear in mind that it can change.<br />
<br />
<u>1st turn Dark Side:</u><br />
As your first action, get out Your Insight Serves You Well. This will already throw off-guard your opponent: no-one plays it as first action. It is nice, this is what you want to do: throw the Dark Side off-guard. Your opponent will think that you do not want Scanning Crew to hit you at all, so that you must be relying on your Rebels pretty much. Will he be playing more &quot;safe&quot; because of it ?<br />
Second action: get Rieekan (V) into hand with Strike Planning.<br />
Third Action: get A Tragedy Has Occurred out.<br />
Near the end of turn: get a Scurrier from your deck if you need to &quot;crunch&quot; on some Dark scrub characters down somewhere. Or if you need something to lose for the next turn (Organised Attack).<br />
<br />
<u>1st turn Light Side: </u><br />
your hand will normally have 1 or 2 system in hand, and usually 2 Y-Wings (or at least cards to draw them, like All Wings Report In or Organised Attack). You need 2 anyway, not more.<br />
As first action, get another Scurrier if you need it (they are selective) to attack somewhere.<br />
Activate 3 + what the opponent gives you. You need at least one force from the opponent to do what you must, but since the Dark Side has already had a turn, you can be pretty sure that in all match-ups you will have the necessary icon.<br />
Ok, get a system with HB, usually Endor.<br />
Now get a system with Rebel Planners (V): take Roche.<br />
Now deploy a Y-Wing to Rendezvous Point for free. Add Rieekan (V) aboard (2 force).<br />
Deploy another Y-Wing for free at Rendezvous Point.<br />
Get Romas &#39;Lock&#39; Navender (V) with Rieekan (V) to the second Y-Wing.<br />
Get another system with Romas (V).<br />
Get Big One and Asteroid Cave there with Roche&#39;s game text.<br />
Move both Y-Wings for free to Endor, you have ability 4, and good forfeit.<br />
End your turn. You should have now an average of 4 BG systems on table (not counting the opponent), which usually will boost your 2nd turn activation to 12+.<br />
<br />
<u>2nd turn Dark Side: </u><br />
meaningless.<br />
<br />
<u>2nd turn Light Side: </u><br />
Play an Organised Attack Lost to get some Y-Wings or..<br />
activate... a lot... (and Tunnel Vision for it).<br />
After activating, drain for 1 if Battle Order is not on table.<br />
Now look for a system with HB. Make a unhappy face. Look again. Glance at your HB locator under your objective (making the opponent notice it). Think it through some 5 seconds, then deploy a system with your objective (usually a high drain one), and, still with a pissed-off face, swap your HB locator (Kiffex) with... Kiffex... It is important however that you do not &quot;really swap&quot; your HB locator BACK into the Shields: you just deploy it straight to the table. It is important that the opponent grasps that you swapped you previous HB (Kiffex) with another system (because, of course, for your opponent, it means that Kiffex was NOT in your reserve, but in your activate pile). A good opponent will jump on this opportunity and scrap Kiffex from your possible Hidden Bases. <br />
It is a pity, however, that Kiffex was, is, and will still be your Hidden Base.<br />
Get another system with Romas (V).<br />
Remember also that you can get Hoth out with Rieekan (V), so if it is inside your deck, get it out with Rieekan (V), not Romas or HB.<br />
Now deploy all Y-Wings to your systems (1 per system), and most importantly one to the Big One at Roche (the first Y-Wing should go to the Big One, so that in case a GREAT DS player uses Id Just As Soon Kiss A Wookie on it, you can just deploy another one there).<br />
Now deploy for 0 (2-2=0 thanks to Tautaun Bones (V))) the Space Slug to the Big One.<br />
Move Romas (V) on his Y-Wing to another system (than Endor), since there is already Rieekan (V) on a Y-Wing there.<br />
During the battle phase the Space Slug will attack your lone Y-Wing there (2 destiny +2 for ferocity). Do not make it lost: relocate it to the Asteroid Cave (mouth is always open). <br />
Draw some cards: you should make it so to have This Is No Cave in hand and some anti-beatdown cards. Leave some 4-6 cards activated at least.<br />
<br />
<u>3rd turn DS: </u> <br />
Flip if you need to cancel some big drains. Else do not flip.<br />
the opponent will see the huge threat of &quot;Drain for a ton for free&quot; on your next turn, since you have an Y-Wing occupying a battleground site (which is the Asteroid Cave). <br />
He will likely try to jump with a big beatdown crew on your helpless landed Y-Wing. Of course, he will know that you surely have some evasion cards, and the list can be long indeed.<br />
Whatever he does, counter him: It Can Wait (both vs. ground or space battles), Rebel Barrier, etc.<br />
If vs. space you have also Alternatives To Fighting or 2 Houjix (and an Escape Pod (V) to draw them). <br />
If he comes down on the Cave, Barrier / It Can Wait if you can, else just wait for the battle with a big smile. Play  It&#39;s A Trap! as a just action if possible. If it works good, else skip the just action phase The opponent won&#39;t usually have any just actions either. Then play This Is No Cave (after his first action), relocating your Y-Wing to the Big One and ending the battle. This Is No Cave goes to Used (track it).<br />
Now it is your turn to have an action during his battle phase: make the Slug attacks again your Y-Wing. Which is then relocated, again, to the Asteroid Cave. But your opponent cannot battle it again, because he did already battled you there.<br />
Smile even more.<br />
Flip. The opponent will have to pay 1 to draw 1.<br />
<br />
<u>3rd turn LS: </u><br />
Activate... a lot...<br />
Drain for free. Look as a huge part of the opponent&#39;s life force (and his smile) goes away. He will also lose most cards from hand (useless junk against you).<br />
Drop some more Y-Wings to deal some more damage.<br />
Play Recoil In Fear if you have it. Watch the opponent cry.<br />
Move, draw, etc.<br />
Use Threepio to get back This Is No Cave or other cards, etc.<br />
<br />
4th turn Dark Side up to turn 6: Rinse, repeat. Win.<br />
Before the opponent suicides himself, play All Wings Report In to retrieve your whole Lost Pile.<br />
<br />
<u>7th turn Dark Side: </u><br />
which 7th turn ????<br />
<br />
<b>Other stuff:</b><br />
There is only one card that you should grab. And this card is called &quot;Sense&quot;.<br />
Grab it as soon as it is played (the opponent will lose 2).<br />
<br />
<u><b>Card Choices:</u></b><br />
<br />
<I>Threepio With His Parts Showing (x2)</I>: track This Is No Cave to get it back, or any other card you might need. Immune to Restraining Bolt since he is NOT &quot;at a site&quot; (put him in a Y-W). 2 of them to get him quickly, and he works also perfectly with We&#39;re Doomed.<br />
<br />
<I>We&#39;re Doomed: </I>the opponent grabs This Is No Cave and It&#39;s A Tra ? Abuse We&#39;re Doomed when things get ugly. <br />
<br />
<I>Coruscant (special edition): </I> a drain 3 system that CANNOT be your Hidden Base, and that gives deploy +2 to Imperials and Imperial Ships. The opponent will never come there.<br />
<br />
<I>Escape Pod (V): </I> another way to get a much needed Houjix (especially the ones that you just retrieved with AWRI), and another Used Interrupt for the opponent to grab. <br />
<br />
<I>It Can Wait: </I> return to opponent&#39;s hand the ship he just deployed. Or the big character he wanted to beat you down with (on the asteroid cave). This essentially slows the opponent a turn, where you will be draining for a bunch.<br />
It Can Wait was a staple in the first Speed Deal ever created (pre-errata Shot In The Dark Deal). Now it is back.<br />
Great combo with Recoil in Fear.<br />
<br />
<I>Recoil In Fear: </I> it does not only mess up with the few very important cards that the opponent kept in hand, but also allows you to change your hand if it is horrible (like if This Is No Cave has just been Sensed and you do not have a Control & Tunnel Vision to back it up).<br />
<br />
<I>Tibrin: </I> you never know when you will need a specific card from your Lost Pile.<br />
<br />
<I>It&#39;s A Trap!: </I> good card. If the opponent does not have the canceller it works as good as This Is No Cave. So if the opponents grabs one, you still can play the other interrupt.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Questions:</b></u><br />
<br />
<I>What about Monnok ? </I><br />
<br />
Hmmmhhh.. well... you lose ?<br />
Frankly, the only defense is either not drawing too much, either Threepio, either Recoil in Fear. A well place Monnok can make you lose the game.<br />
Still, not everytime it will be so. Considering that Monnok (while being a good card) is often not seen much in tournament play (because of the constant battling), well... I am willing to take the risk.<br />
<br />
<I>Another cheese HB, is this better than Hunter&#39;s cheese HB ? </I><br />
<br />
Having never played or seen his deck, I cannot say. The spread and drain with Kirdo III / Sandwhirl / Desert with Rogue 1 and Commander Luke is strong, but of course not so quick as this deck. <br />
Of course, Hunter is still Hunter. But I&#39;m still Destefanis also (undefeated at Europeans 2004).<br />
Both this deck and Hunter&#39;s one have some cards to deal vs. Watto (speeders do fare well vs. it).<br />
This one is more FUN, though... Come on, Space Slug ? This Is No Cave ? You got to be kidding!<br />
<br />
<I>Why should I play this in a tournament ? </I><br />
<br />
To win, of course.<br />
And not to tire you too much while playing it. Keep your energy for your Dark deck. <br />
But if you are a nice guy, do not play it more than once or twice.<br />
<br />
<I>Will it push an errata ? </I><br />
<br />
I do not think so. Maybe a counter card. But this deck has some weaknesses, which is Monnok, and Court (which can get its ships from the Reserve with the objective), and other heavy and quick space decks.<br />
If this deck forces an errata, I want any Hunter&#39;s deck hit by an errata too. (joke)<br />
<br />
<I>No run-away cards ? </I><br />
<br />
No.<br />
There are so many cards that stop you from running away that it is sickening (albeit I prefer it that way). None of them are immune to Sense, either.<br />
I prefer It Can Wait (immune to Sense), and Houjix (immune to Sense).<br />
Much more safe, don&#39;t you think ?<br />
Of course, some of my cards are NOT immune to Sense, like This Is No Cave, Rebel Barrier, Alternatives To Fighting. But plainly put, you cannot have bad surprises if you do not plan to run away.<br />
The only card that makes you run away is This Is No Cave. I&#39;m willing to lose 2 because of Firepower (V) for this one.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Match-ups:</u></b><br />
<br />
<b>Watto: </b> Watto has always been a hard match-up for Hidden Base, due to early pressure, and a first turn S&D, AND Reegesk (V). Well, no more.<br />
when Watto faces HB, they do not think they will face Tautaun Bones (V). When seeing it, they will shake with fear.<br />
They will probably try to hide Watto with someone else, or wait a turn. Whatever they do, if Watto shows his nose on the ground, drop him a Worrt from under your shield. And if for some reason Reegesk is at an adjacent site, drop him a Scurrier. With 2 Scurriers and a Worrt, you have all the chances to slow the Watto player, especially for S&D.<br />
Even if the opponent starts Krayt Dragon Bones (V), he will put Bubo with Watto, and this won&#39;t protect his scrub (usually Reegesk (V)), from a snack from Worrt (cancelling S&D). All in all, you won&#39;t see S&D turn one.<br />
If he moves then Bubo to eat Worrt, just drop a Scurrier on Watto next turn. Beating Watto has never been so easy.<br />
The good point of this HB is that you are not playing Tautaun Bones (V) because of Watto, but because you need it. That it works so nicely against Watto is just an added bonus.<br />
After flipping (2nd turn, remember), just lose 2 to prevent any free ship somewhere (or do not lose 2, as you wish, since Watto will have enough force to deploy its ships anyway), and drain while cancelling the opponent&#39;s drains.<br />
<br />
<b>HDADTJ: </b> well, you WILL lose to Visage all game (the opponent will lose also turn 1 however). But you won&#39;t suffer any force drain. Victory ? You bet.<br />
<br />
<b>CCT: </b> a match-up much more difficult than it seems: thanks to Despair (V), you cannot relocate your Y-Wing with This Is No Cave. What can you do ? Pray for It&#39;s A Trap to pass through. Else play safe: you will have to pay for your drains. Do not even deploy the Cave, Big One, etc. Or deploy them but do not put a Y-Wing there unless you are sure the opponent has no character left in his hand (but then all it takes is IG-88 (V) to pull one).<br />
But remember, if you have It&#39;s a Trap, risk it and play offensively.<br />
<br />
<b>BHBM: </b> the only match-up where possibly you won&#39;t have any icons from the opponent on your first turn. BHBM is slow, this LS deck is quick. Not really a problem: you have no Luke, so you will lose 3 each turn (and you will not lose from any cheese duel tech), but they will lose 10+. Questions ? <br />
<br />
<b>MKOS: </b>without any place where to beatdown you (thanks to This Is No Cave), they will be soon gasping for air. Of course, they could play with Hutt Influence to prevent you from cancelling their drains. Rebel Planners (V) allow you anyway to cancel one anyway. <br />
<br />
<b>Other match-ups: </b> ignore the opponent. Do you stuff. Win (if possible of course).<br />
<br />
<u><b>Conclusion: </b></u><br />
Yes, I know, I&#39;m crazy.<br />
Space Slug was considered one of the most useless LS rare in the world.<br />
Not anymore.<br />
And after managing to build a good DS deck with Krayt Dragon Bones (V), now even Tautaun Bones (V) did see some good and strong action!!! (wink at Hunter)<br />
Try it and have fun with it!<br />
