At Worlds 2007 it went 2-2 beating LSC of both David McCune and Brady Moore and losing to Brian Fred’s WYS Palace Raider (timed with both having 17 LifeForce each and my 19 cards in lost pile against his 17 – quite nice if you can play some interrupts from lost pile, right?) and Angelo Consoli’s heavy pimped Space QMC.<br />
<br />
It’s biggest change to “Gumbercules” is that it is based on Endor Operations. This has some advantages instead of starting with Combat Readiness and a random system/site:<br />
- You have more variation in your starting effects because Combat Response can be pulled by Establish Secret Base (v) and Endor Shield (v) by the bunker. This makes room for Inconsequential Losses (v) to pull your weapons fast and maybe even Imperial Decree (v) vs. damage like WHAP, Profit or Padme (v) or choke decks like TRM.<br />
- Your Endor system activation stays the same even if your opponent starts Strike Planning (but don’t flip unless you generate enough force).<br />
- After flipping your objective (which can be done in turn 1 when Establish Secret Base (v) pulls Ominous Rumors) your opponent draws no more battle destiny in each battle.<br />
- Ominous Rumors adding 2 to system drains can be hugh when the opponent can’t satisfy Ultimatum shield early (or after collapsing his battleground sites).<br />
- You are choking your opponent completely by cancelling their force icons on Endor system with Endor Shield (v) and their docking bay icon with Establish Secret Base (v) once an AT-ST is deployed there.<br />
- Both of your sites are interior and can be collapsed with your bomber in case they are swarmed with Jedi.<br />
<br />
This brings me to the best thing of this deck: Most non-interrupt cards can be pulled so you can control the game more easily. The only non-interupt cards that have no pullers are: Darth Maul With Lightsaber, Arica, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, Dengar In Punishing One and Lateral Damage. 5 cards, not more!<br />
<br />
A good 1st turn if your opponent starts An Unusual Amount Of Fear goes like this:<br />
- pull Lando with Lando System? and/or Scythe 1 or Scimitar 2 with Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back!<br />
- pull Establish Secret Base (v) with your objective<br />
- deploy Endor Shield (v) from reserve with the bunker<br />
- pull and deploy Merrejk for 3 force to the bunker<br />
- deploy a system (usually Kashyyyk) with Merrejk<br />
- deploy Establish Secret Base (v) on Endor system<br />
- deploy Ominour Rumors with Establish Secret Base (v) and deploy it for 2 force<br />
- flip your objective<br />
- lose a card to pull Flagship Operations (v) with Crossfire (v) and deploy it on a system<br />
- if your opponent has given you at least 2 force you can deploy Scimitar 2/Captain Jonus/Proton Bombs to Naboo to threaten a collapsed site in the next turn (don’t worry about an early beatdown in space, Jonus has a built-in Ghhhk and any pilot can fly the bomber afterwards…)<br />
<br />
If you start against Thrown Back (v) you might only pull Ominous Rumors with your objective (and deploy it for 2 force) and Endor Shield (v) 1st turn, draw a few cards and say go.<br />
<br />
Getting Merrejk to the bunker is the usual way in both versions. But beware: Unless you have your Ghhhk in hand, 1 force saved for Draw Their Fire and packed anti-Frozen Assets shield you’re asking for a game ending beatdown from a spy (everyone plays Corran Horn and/or Boushh) or a Revolution in the next turns. Losing Crossfire to allow him drawing at least a battle destiny may help a bit but it’s risky nonetheless leaving him in the bunker.<br />
So move Merrejk as soon as possible in a walker on the docking bay. Your second Endor Shield (v) pull is most likely General Veers (v) if you have Blizzard 1 or 2 in hand. If you are afraid of drawing too many cards to get them you can go the long way of pulling Admiral Piett, deploying him to the bunker, getting a ship in space, pull Battle Deployment with Piett and deploy a vehicle from reserve. If ground is not a problem use your 2nd pull for Major Mianda (a Commander) as he’s THE pilot in the deck shooting everything down with his gametext of adding 2 to a weapon destiny and his ship allowing him to shoot in his move phases.<br />
<br />
Normally you should own space after a few turns, just the Home One and nasty interrupts like Corellian Retort (v) (nice play, Mr. Fred) can be a problem.<br />
There are three ways to kill the Home One: Lateral Damage it and battle, attack with Dengar In Punishing One and killing it’s immunity to attrition or track a 6 (most likely A Few Maneuvers), shoot with Mianda and add 1 with Lando (v).<br />
Tallon Roll is useless against independent starfighters but all other starfighters should be no problem. Only Wedge in Red Squadron 1 (who adds 6 to Tallon Roll) should be Lateral Damaged first before trying to do so.<br />
<br />
Shooting starfighters with high maneuver is easier than you might think – a combination of tracking/redrawing weapon destiny with Fighter Cover (which even works when trying to collapse a site)/Fel’s +3/Mianda’s +2/ Hebsly’s -1/Lando’s +1 should always do the trick.<br />
<br />
This brings me to the destinies of this deck which are quite high:<br />
0 – 2<br />
1 – 10<br />
2 – 7<br />
3 – 4<br />
4 – 14<br />
5 – 10<br />
6 – 4<br />
The average is 3.25 but should increase at least to 3.5 after pulling the systems/Endor Shield guys/Lando and Proton Bombs. When trying to collapse a site at least one weapon destiny (when drawing again with Fighter Cover) should be a 4 making it a 5 with Lando.<br />
<br />
61st card:<br />
Imperial Artillery<br />
Captain Bewil (v)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
LSC – This should be an autowin if they don’t play Planetary Defenses and still going 70/30 for you if they do. They will control your Endor docking bay sooner or later but after you collapsed one or two Naboo and both Endor sites there isn’t much your opponent can do. He probably plays only the Falcon which should not be a big problem.<br />
<br />
Senate – Difficult matchup. Most likely he starts Strike Planning therefore you might consider of NOT flipping your objective or you will be choked at your own system. Including Coruscant system in the deck and trying to bomb the senate would be fun but your opponent should be clever enough to cancel all your system drains and therefore not allowing you to use the Proton Bombs. You can try to collapse his 3/2 site but it will be difficult. A well played Monnok to hit his 4 Amidalas might do the trick. In the end it will be a drain race (you in space at 3 systems with one getting canceled, him on ground on 2 sites adding 2) which you may win 30-40% of your games.<br />
<br />
Hidden Base – Cool matchup. He wants to battle your ships while you want to avoid battle and shoot down 1-2 ships each of your move phases. Finding the hidden base should not be a problem. If he is playing lots of starship weapons he wins, if not he loses. That easy.<br />
<br />
Watch Your Step – If you fear Panic don’t start battles just shoot in your move phases, collapse both Tatooine sites or Trample with your walkers some RFCs. Any other version like Palace Raiders gives you more problems. Hold your space fleet together even if that means getting drained at one system. Shoot down your opponents ships turn by turn and grab Corellian Retort (v). Your flipped objective should help you winning this game.<br />
<br />
TRM – Start Imperial Decree (v) and activate on his icons if you have a good hand. He will beat you on the ground sooner or later so stick to space, shoot down his few ships and win the drain race. The biggest problem will be killing the Home One but I mentioned above the ways to get rid of her.<br />
<br />
D!ck Hat – If D!ck Hat is still popular in your area change Kashyyyk for Tatooine and start collapsing the cantina and the Jabba’s Palace site. That and killing the Home One should do it even if they kill all your walkers with Smoke Screens sooner or later (probably sooner). 60/40 if you play with Tatooine, 40/60 if you don’t.<br />
<br />
WHAP – Start Imperial Decree (v), collapse at least one Naboo site, never go to the other one and drain like mad in space. If they don’t play Planetary Defenses shield ask them if they want to concede. Easy win.<br />
<br />
Profit – Not very popular at the moment. Change Kashyyyk for Tatooine if you want to be prepared for it. Start Imperial Decree (v), don’t give him any aliens and collapse the audience chamber. Otherwise it will be a drain race going 50/50.<br />
<br />
QMC – If you’re lucky your opponent deploys Bespin: Cloud City and you can bomb his sites. You might be able to kill all space (which is tough because their starfighters are maneuver +2 from the objective) and cancel Celebration. But still your opponent will drain for 2 at all sites and might outdrain you. If they don’t deploy Cloud City or play a hugh fleet like Angelo you will lose the game.<br />
<br />
This deck might not be one of the top dark decks around but (as mentioned above) can be a good meta call at the moment. Enjoy!<br />
