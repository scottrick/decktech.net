<br />
Editor&#8217;s Note #2:  Take out 1 ors and 1 twilek for 2 (special edition) tie cannons to kill stuff like falcon and outrider. <br />
<br />
Editor&#8217;s Note #3: I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO GRIMTAASH PROTECTION IN THIS DECK!  first off in the shop i go to I have only ever ONCE had a grimtaash played on me (during special edition days) and also everywhere it is not a popular meta choice right now.  if i knew people that played grimtaash i would put that in, but i don&#8217;t so i won&#8217;t.  if you want well guarded in then put it in by all means.<br />
<br />
Editor&#146;s Note #4:  Ok take out u-3po for 5D6-RA7<br />
<br />
To IBMyers 1:  I don&#146;t know what is wrong with people like you.  i have three admiral&#146;s orders.  wys usually packs one i&#146;ll take the leader.  yet you assume that wys will have ill take the leader out, control tatooine and have both tat docking bays out.  you say that they will continually retrieve their lost pile with harvest, that is why i start with secret plans.  If you want to you can play with something special planned for them, i just like secret plans better.  and why do you tell me that wys will get lots of destinies?  I know that, I mentioned it in my matchup.  There are two TIE cannons in here.  TIE cannons kill the outrider and Falcon easy, and after that I have an easy win.  And I don&#146;t care about light side SAC, because i don&#146;t know anybody that&#146;s ever played SAC in my area, and i would rather have oppressive enforcement than the combo card.  i bet if i had the combo card everyone would be telling me in the reviews not to worry about light side SAC and just go with oppressive to make my dreads happy.<br />
<br />
Destiny Layout (after starting stuff and pulling Wakeelmui, and taking Oppressive Enforcement into consideration)<br />
<br />
0  |  6<br />
1  |  0<br />
2  |  20<br />
3  |  3<br />
4  |  12<br />
5  |  9<br />
6  |  3<br />
<br />
The destiny is not too shabby for a tie deck.  24 destinies of 4 or over.  It gets better after you start using Commander Merrejk to pull out systems and the All Power to Weapons/Abyssin Ornament/ Short Range Fighters to pull out low destiny TIEs and Outer Rim Scouts.  However destiny is not something I really considered too much when making this deck.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
ISB:  The reason I use this over Set Your Course For Alderaan is so that I can retrieve my Outer Rim Scouts during my draw phase.  Set Your Course For Alderaan gets quicker activation, but it also gives away more force, gives free land drain sites to the opponent and has that nice big fat Death Star drain you have to protect.  <br />
<br />
Oppressive Enforcement: Why not the combo card you ask?  Well, I have seven dreadnaughts.  By themselves they are destiny three.  With Oppressive Enforcement &There Is No Try they are destiny 3.  With Oppressive Enforcement they are destiny 4.  so that is why I don&#8217;t use the combo card.<br />
<br />
Cards I would like to fit in:<br />

Ghhhk and those Rebels Won&#8217;t Escape Us<br />
<br />
ok can&#8217;t think of any other cards that need explaining, so here&#8217;s the basic strategy.  first thing pull wakeelmui with mob. points (pull rendili if wakeelmui is not in there).  next activate three and play twilek advisor for sienar fleet systems.  If your opponent gave you any force activate that too.   Deploy Wakeelmui.  Deploy Seinar Fleet Systems.  Deploy any systems in your hand.  Draw.  From there on out set up drains with outer rim scouts on the dreadnaughts and the ties and pull out the systems with Commander Merrejk.  Kessel is usually the first system I pull so that I can get cheap ships and then spread out.  Twilek for dreaded imperial starfleet and den of thieves so that you can cancel two drains per turn.  After you flip don&#8217;t forget that you can retrieve one outer rim scout per turn.  Don&#8217;t forget that you retrieve 1 every time you deploy a time and once per turn you can send one to used pile instead of lost.  Don&#8217;t forget to play Abyssin Ornament and Short Range Fighters once per turn for mucho retrieval.  Don&#8217;t forget that lots of power six ties can beat the Outrider in a battle.  Draining the opponent is a good idea.  Your admiral order should stay out most of the game since you have three of them, so i&#8217;ll take the leader isn&#8217;t a big problem.  Don&#8217;t forget that your outer rim scouts deploy for a mere 1 to the dreadnaughts (with the AO).  Ok so the strategy is REAL simple as you can see.  Oh yeah couple things I forgot.  Battle Order.  So you have to pay for your drains.  Big Deal, you will still drain for a lot and the systems give lots of activation.  I activate 16 force BY MY SELF  with all the systems out.  Surprise Assault.  Actually this is not as much a problem as it seems because the ties are power 4 with a dreadnaught and the dreadnaughts are power 5, 7 if an outer rim scout is piloting.  Grimtaash:  Not big meta in my area, but you can use Yarna d&#8217;al Gargan if you want.  Now for the matchups:<br />
<br />
vs.  MWYHL:  Ha Ha the space here isn&#8217;t good, and they usually don&#8217;t have many drain sites.  You should have them down to less than 10 force by the time they flip.  If they are playing mains on the ground there is no way they can hurt you on the ground since they probably don&#8217;t have lots of battleground sites and you can cancel two of their drains per turn.  The retrieval will make up for everything else you lose.  When and if they come to space, usually with star cruisers you have two choices: 1)beat them down just for daring to come to space 2) if they don&#8217;t have order to engage out run away like a non-interactive cheeseball sissy.  this is usually a good idea and works incredibly well since they will have a hard time damaging you.  i hope she&#8217;s allright might hurt a little, but that is what the retrieval is for.  easy matchup.  next.<br />
<br />
vs.  Profit:  Hmmm, let me see will I start two outer rim scouts in the chamber?  I think not.   Whatever this is a drain race, but Profit doesn&#8217;t usually track big retrieval and won&#8217;t outdrain you and won&#8217;t cancel your drains.  This deck packs big retrieval and will outdrain profit and will cancel profit&#8217;s drains.  You win.  Since profit will lose to everything else though now I guess this was kind of pointless writing about this.<br />
<br />
vs.  TIGIH:  HAH!  So luke gets to drain for 2 a turn.  Argh.  That&#8217;s annoying.  BUT!  that is what dreaded imperial starfleet and den of thieves are for.  this matchup is the same as profit, only without the profit damage : ).  again same as profit space is minimal.  in fact space is minimal in all light side decks nowadays except for ebo and WYS which is why dark side space is such a good idea.  thing here will probably be the super-falcon.  again you have your two choices, run away or fight.  whatever&#8217;s easiest, you&#8217;ll still get drains in.  and if you do happen to get a outer rim scout on a dreadnaught with seven ties and an all power to weapons then it really sucks for your opponent.<br />
<br />
HBX or EBO X:  This is the hardest matchup of them all.  This is the only one where you play different.  This is the one where you play beatdown TIES.  this is the one where you get a huge hand and wait for opponent to make first move so you can deploy lots of ties and beat him down.  if you start draining first then it will probably end up the other way around.  this is not really a deck that is metaed for this stuff, this deck is metaed for decks that stay at docking bays and try to fight you, or decks that go to space with just to ships.<br />
<br />
vs.  WYS:  Ahh, finally we get to Watch Your Step.  They give you force, that is good.   They give you systems to drain at, that is good.  They play with ships that get lots of high destiny draws, that is bad.  Fortunately you pack more AOs than they pack I&#8217;ll take the Leaders, so you dont have to worry about that.  However that drain at kessel doesn&#8217;t hurt much when you can cancel it and neither does the cantina drain.  If you wait until they deploy outrider and/or falcon and then go drain somewhere else, then you can run away or beat them up when they come to you ( ah yes the famous two options ) if they are playing with palace raiders on the ground then good for them cause you will outdrain them and outretrieve them.  (the harvest version may outretrieve you, but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of ground sites.  u-3po will be tech cause they don&#8217;t have corran horn.  The two TIE cannons will be killer against outrider and falcon.<br />
<br />
Ok, that&#8217;s my deck.  If you don&#8217;t like it, tough, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s my deck not yours.  I appreciate constructive reviews and anything i could do to make this deck better.<br />
