First of all I want to give the guy who created the "Lost Pile? Whats a lost Pile?" deck MAJOR PROPS for the Rebel Tech Tech (no pun intended)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Basic Strategy:<br />
<br /><br />
Depending on what you got in your starting hand determines your first turn. Between 3 Lukes, and 3 of his ship, and 2 All wings combos, you should be able to get at least one in your starting hand. On your own you generate 4 first turn. Hopefully your opponent will give you 2, which is average. Before activating pull Madine and Rieeken with Strike Planning. Activate. Drop a site from reserve, and any from your starting hand. If you got one in your starting hand you can flip first turn if they didn&#39;t drop to your DB. If they didnt drop to the DB, drop Rieeken to a site, use his text, get Tigran Jamiro V down (for free from reserve) And drop Madine for 3 to the other site. Flip.Use your last force, move whoever is at the DB into the 2/0 Massassi HQ or whatever site is adjacent so you dont get a beatdown on yourself.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
If they dropped someone to your DB, most likely a choke Vader, you can flip 2nd turn by deploying other sites, and instead of dropping Rieeken ETC., just draw up and get hopefully at least 1 site.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
2nd turn (if already flipped-average) Use Rieeken to drop Haven to Y4. Drop Luke in Red 5 to Y4. Use Madine to pull Cracken or Blount (with all the Lukes and All wings you should&#39;ve gotten Luke and AiR5 into hand already) and use them to pull their matching ship and deploy all to Y4 for a mere 2 force. Luke is free onto AiR5 and that deploys for 4(-2 with haven) The other guys deploy cheap on their ships and then free after Haven gets done with them. Use a Rebel Tech V to pull Up an Advance Prep V if you dont have one in hand. (There are 5 Rebel Techs AND 3 Advance Preps, which totals 8. I think you shouldn&#39;t have trouble getting your hands on one :) ) Your Objective (Flip side) Pulls you up the Death Star and the Rebel Tech, so if you already have AP V in hand drop down the Rebel Tech V at a site to add 1 to your Attack Run total. Use AP V and get the Trench, Proton Torps, and Attack run from under your starting effect. Move Luke to the Death Star for 1. Use Attack Run&#39;s text to move him to the trench (for free) and..well.. ATTACK RUN! Luke is ability of 4, he adds 3, Rebel Tech adds 1, you add 4-5 for all the sites you have down. Someone at the Massassi HQ adds 2, and Rieeken V or Madine adds 1 at the Briefing Room. That totals 15-16. You get 2 destinies on top of that. To complete Attack Run you have to get greater than 15. I don&#39;t think it will be hard to get at least a 1 with 2 destinies. BOOM DS is blown away and opponent loses 8 force. +3 for each DS site they have on table, which is absolutely gamebreaking against SYCFA.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
After the DS is blown away, you retrieve 3 force each time you deploy a starship. Not only that but you can once per turn, deploy ANY starship from hand or reserve, FOR FREE. Very Nice. Tala 1 and 2 with pilots and Luke in ship and HCF are all Starfighters, so one at each of your 3 systems plus a free capital at each you are draining +2 at each. 3 at Y4, 4 at Kiffex, 4 at Naboo. Ouch. Likely they have invaded your sites so you should shuttle up to a capital and drop DTF on them and Drop a V Rebel Tech down. Initiate a battle; you retrieve one, they lose 1. You send Rebel Tech to used pile, and end the battle. VERY NICE! Once Again, MAJOR PROPS, to the dude that came up with that. Very abusive and WORKS ANYWHERE. And you can pull a Rebel Tech EVERY turn :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
CARD CHOICES:<br />
<br /><br />
Naboo/Kiffex- Close Parsec, 2/2 Heavy drain systems when my bonuses shoot off.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
We Wish to board at once/Signal- Both pull effects, thats all I use them for. I don&#39;t play 2 of a Specific one, because if one gets grabbed I don&#39;t want to have to pay and stack to use the other. More likely Advance Prep V will get grabbed, however, it wont matter :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Control/Tunnel Vision- If I cannot find a certain card, this helps. Cancels a drain, SAC, and annoying Immediate Effects.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Star Destroyer!- Against SYCFA or anything running destroyers, puts a 7 on top of reserve for me so I can put a little hurt on them if they are crazy enough to come to me in space.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Fly Casual- I honestly see no use for this card as I can just move in, but in case you need it, its there. It&#39;s a destiny 6 nonetheless.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Incon Barriers x3- ESSENTIAL to this deck. Set For Stun will kill this deck by getting rid of Luke. Plus, when I want to drop my *FREE* Home One down for a butt whooping, I dont like to be barrierd.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
So many sites?- Likely Opponent will take 1 of them, so I like to have  extras. Plus, it ensures faster flipping.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Massassi Throne Room- It&#39;s another good site. its a 1/0 to help choke, and if they take 2 sites I need it.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Entrenchment- Drop a Rebel Tech V on this to cancel a drain.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Why no Your Insight to pull up Honor ETC.? I don&#39;t prefer to start a card and then lose it just to get an effect. I instead have effect pullers that do just as fine. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Everything else is self explanatory.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
MATCHUPS:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
WALKERS: This matchup is indeed in your favor. They will be concentrated on their own stuff so you will have no trouble flipping. Flip, blow away, they lose 8. Well then they make you lose 6, because I will have Honor down by Signaling or WWTBAOing for it. Honor reduces the Non BG drains and the YMSYL damage. I am thinking about throwing in a T47 battle formation to cancel WG.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
SYCFA- Blow up the Death Star. They lose big with all their DS sites down. You blow it away latest 2nd turn. They won&#39;t have Ties. They play Star Destroyers. Once you blow it away pack your *FREE* ships at your systems, retrieve tons and win. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
CCT SPACE- They have some starfighters, but what Ties? Maybe a Baron Fel in ship. But what are the chances of them getting anything like that down 2nd turn before you blow up the DS? They will wait to drop him until after you&#39;ve deployed Luke to drop on him, but in the same turn you drop Luke you blow the Death Star so it won&#39;t matter. You Menace Fades away their bonuses at Kasshhyyyk and at EP1 Tatooine (Maul in ship drains +1 there) and the only heavy drain they have coming to you is the Despair V drain where Jabba&#39;s Prize is. This is not a problem. You retrieve 1 with Luke and 3 each time you deploy a ship. Thats more than enough to retrieve good. If they decide to come to your sites, more power to them, you flip 2nd turn, and blow the DS away 3rd. It won&#39;t matter.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Huntdown- Minimal ships. Bossk and Zuckuss aren&#39;t immune to jack. Visage 1 a turn? Luke...1 BACK a turn. Even though Luke only retrieves half, you still have plenty of ships. They will always invade your sites, but then again you just flip 2nd turn. At worst, you flip 3rd turn and blow it 4th. Thats plenty of time to really get set up.  The 8 force loss is backbreaking to HD as they have little, if any, retrieval.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Deal or any other degenerate deck that trys to out drain you- You set up menace fades. Retrieve, make em lose 8 etc. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
