Or maybe this negates Brandon Ruck&#39;s entire entry.  You be the judge.*End Edit*<br />
<br />
Play whatever shields you think you need.<br />
<br />
This deck was designed by Brandon Schele, Tim Simon and myself.  Tim noticed a message on the swccgpc.com rules message boards asking if the "one rule" applied to (V) Labria.<br />
<br />
Until today it did not.  (V) Labria&#39;s gametext after the re-edit reads:<br />
<br />
"Once per game, may / Undercover on Labria. During your control phase, may reveal top card of Reserve Deck. Place revealed card on top of Force Pile, Reserve Deck, or Used Pile."<br />
<br />
So, the idea is that you can reveal the top card of reserve deck as many times as you want. This allows you to do many very broken things:<br />
<br />
1. Activate your entire reserve deck<br />
2. Activate cards until your desired destiny is on top<br />
3. Activate low destiny characters/ships/locations etc. that you use to set up a deck, while placing all high destiny cards in your used pile for tracking purposes.<br />
<br />
So, when realizing this, creative deck-building ensued by myself, Brandon Schele and Tim Simon.  You can make a plethora of decks using this engine, conceivably doing anything you want.<br />
<br />
In the end the best two decks we designed were a Dark Deal deck and a Fear deck.  This is the Dark Deal deck, I may post the Fear deck later.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally my deck titles for both of these decks were based on Franklin D. Roosevelt inadvertantly.  This deck can be referred to as "The New Deal" and the Fear deck can be "The Only Thing We Have To Fear Is...Fear Itself!".  Or you can call the decks whatever you want, since you can&#39;t really use them anymore.  Another deck title option is "Deal...Or No Deal?".<br />
<br />
Anyways, game setup is the same every time.<br />
<br />
Turn 1, activate only 4 force.  You want to minimize the chances of activating crucial parts of the combo.<br />
<br />
Use (V) Location x3 to pull Jabba&#39;s Palace: Audience Chamber.  Use the Audience Chamber to pull (V) Labria.  Use (V) Labria to deploy (V) Undercover on himself.  This is why the deck runs 2x of each of these crucial cards for the combo.<br />
<br />
Turn 2, think about what you need for your setup.    Don&#39;t even activate, since (V) Labria can do it for you.  Use (V) Labria to peek at every card.  Setting up Dark Deal and Occupation is the main priority, but Dark Deal is preferred.  Make sure you take a copy of I&#39;d Just As Soon Kiss A Wookie into hand.  Also take a few locations and guys for the setup.  You can go through your entire deck here, so go for the optimal setup.<br />
<br />
The reason behind using troopers is that (V) Forced Servitude lets you recirculate all of them back into your reserve deck at the end of the game which will give you high differential.  You put the opponent in an impossible situation, because if they ignore you, your Dark Deal drains are massive, yet if they come down to disrupt you, you can provide the counter-beat with troopers, Vader, Trooper Assault and Dark Jedi presence.<br />
<br />
Obvious things:<br />
1. Grab and SENSE Grimtaash.  Don&#39;t take multiples into hand early.<br />
2. Lieutenant Renz can create a one time giant drain.  Use this early, so that you get in a major turn of Dark Deal Drains, Occupation and Renz damage.  This will probably win the game that turn (which should be turn 4).  Protect Renz with I&#39;d Just As Soon Kiss A Wookie and Elis Helrot.<br />
<br />
Cool tricks:<br />
1. Use (V) Labria to activate until you have a 0 on top, then play Overload.<br />
2. Use (V) Labria to activate until you have a 0 on top, then play Elis Helrot.<br />
<br />
Remember!<br />
You start a Ghhhk effect.  Play super aggressive, there&#39;s no reason not to!<br />
<br />
Also, Take Evasive Action is for cancelling the Houjix combo card.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the new ruling just came through that "top card" implies the one rule.  You can view the ruling here: http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=16044.<br />
<br />
Still, this deck is funny to try out pre-errata, so give it a whirl when playing with friends.<br />
