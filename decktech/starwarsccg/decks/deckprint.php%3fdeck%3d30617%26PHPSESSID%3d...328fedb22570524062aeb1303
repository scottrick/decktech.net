Tatooine (Ep1)   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my attempt to create a halfway decent deck using that crazy union rep Ardon &quot;Vapor&quot; Crell. <br />
<br />
You want to set up Bo Shuda at the AC early on, and then use the ever handy You will Take Me To Jabba Now to get some aliens. You want to have Vapor, Geezum, Kabe, and Tessek there.  Yes, it will probably get grabbed, but you should be able to get 1-2 uses out of it.<br />
<br />
Geezum will pull sites (he needs to move to the Desert Heart, so give him some backup), and the rest of the aliens above are rep-types, who give bonuses to other cards while at the AC. <br />
<br />
You then need to use NSWC&#39;s to pull non uniques, like Moisture Farmers and Chadra-Fans. The MFs will pull the devices needed to get up your drains. <br />
<br />
Other choices: <br />
Rycar (V) pulls my LS Profs, which can help bring the hurt on the DS, through the power bonus or the drain bonus.  A second turn drain of 3 is not at all unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Leia (V) is my favorite Leia- she can really put the hurt on DS leaders. <br />
<br />
Since we are playing Tatooine, old Ben K is ideal. <br />
<br />
Ep1 Obi- If you get him out, he can be the flying avenger and help defend all of Tatooine. <br />
<br />
Plus, both versions of Obi will deploy for less at his Hut. <br />
<br />
Padme- gets Obi and Qui out. <br />
<br />
Chadra-Fans: They are high destiny (4), and are power 3 forfeit 4 with Kabe at the AC. Plus their GT is fun, it may give you an idea of what your opponent has in store for you. Basically helpful for battling and soaking up attrition. <br />
<br />
Bacta Tank- since battling is not my forte, this can save some of the mains for another round. <br />
<br />
Underworld Contacts helps with Activation and makes your Force drains un -cancellable/modiable on Tatooine where you have 2 aliens- easy enough in this deck.  Very big in this deck!  <br />
<br />
Tauntaun Bones (V)- Worrt can help protect your people! <br />
<br />
Jundland Wastes- FD +1, +2 with a vaporator. Can get as high as 5 a hydroponics station and Vapor at the AC. <br />
<br />
As you can see, this may not get close to winning any tournaments, but I&#39;m looking forward to the look on my opponent&#39;s face when I bust it out on him. Please let me know where I can improve and thanks for looking!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
