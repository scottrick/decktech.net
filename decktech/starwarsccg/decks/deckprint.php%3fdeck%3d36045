   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Another original deck, this one only has a few months of play-testing behind it, yet it seems very solid. Full of tricks, sick destiny, force choke, and beats, this deck is designed to keep the DS player off balance and guessing. Plenty of opportunities to modify for your particular play, my version is still a work in progress.<br />
<br />
STRENGTHS<br />
As a rogue deck the strategies presented within are stronger than something that is expected. Senate is strong regardless, add in the force choke abilities of Luke at Beggars Canyon in conjunction with the Flipside of the objective and you have a very tough combination to beat.<br />
<br />
This deck naturally force chokes, giving up 2 DS force to your LS generation of 10. This deck doesn&#39;t need much force to operate, and has a quick / cheap setup.<br />
<br />
EARLY GAME<br />
Start w/ your typical senate stuff. Get Mothma down asap and flip. Use her gametext to get beggars canyon. Get out the hovercam quickly.<br />
<br />
The next thing to do is get Luke-V to beggars canyon w/ IWY2-v. Use Rycar for IWY2. Getting Luke out is hastened w/ Luke-V x2, Lukes back, C/Tv, + Threepio. It&#39;s very easy to get him on the table.<br />
<br />
MID GAME<br />
Civil Disorder will force the DS to deploy characters, against all decks except Rops + Scum you will have more characters on table b/c of your senators. You can beat on them w/ EPPs, or with any ability 4 character and knock them off your sites. Go to space if necessary.<br />
<br />
LUKE AT THE CANYON<br />
The benefits to this are sick: Free T-16, +1 Force Drain, and Luke gets +1 destiny. Thats ... TWO destinies. The BEST part is that the DS has to use 1 to draw 1 ... in conjunction w/ the Flipside of the objective (put 2 cards back) makes for a sick combination.<br />
<br />
Use Rycar to get IWYT so that DS doesn&#39;t draw destinies, yet if you don&#39;t want to lose three force there are plenty of other options, like losing Luke to attrition and bringing him back with Old Ben, or having characters on the T-16 w/ him to absorb attrition. Often, use the political effect to make any DS destiny draw of 3 or less = 0, and you do not have to cancel the destiny.<br />
<br />
ANY AND ALL BATTLES<br />
Senator Palpy is sick with his damage adding text. Couple that with your high destinies & effects manipulation, a lone EPP can lay waste to a site w/ over-flow.<br />
<br />
SPACE<br />
With Home Run x2 and 3 R2 in Red 5, Space isn&#39;t much of an issue. You do not need to stomp all over the DS in space, just hold one system and drain like crazy. There are several ability 4 pilots to get around Zuckuss or Maul ability tricks. Home 1 can usually hold a system by itself. Limit the DS to 1 battle destiny and subtracting 3 from any of their draws guarantee&#39;s that Home Star will never die to attrition.<br />
<br />
RETRIEVAL<br />
On the Edge is key at the right time. Retrieve it w/ Wokling and do it again. Be sure to get around Coward when using this. Might of the Republic can net a few cards to, including getting OtE back to use a third time.<br />
<br />
SENATORS<br />
I went heavy on the senator mix so that I could dominate DS Senate and always have senators to place on the effects.<br />
<br />
SPECIFIC CARDS<br />
Princess Leia V - a Senator, and sometimes can deploy as a react. A nice surprise for when somebody tries to beat on Luke.<br />
Civil Disorder - Direct Damage, Compels the DS to Act<br />
Goo Nee Tay x 2 - Force Choking is good.<br />
BEGGAR - It Deploys for FREE .. Did I mention that Force Choking is GOOD? Especially sick in this deck.<br />
Old Ben - Replay any just lost character back to Tat for 1 force ... one of my favorite cards.<br />
Jedi&#39;s Resilience x 2 - Higher Destiny than Multiple EPPs w/ Sticks<br />
2 Qui w Rod / 1 Obi w Rod - Qui is anti-maul, has an icon, harder to hit<br />
Corran - Ability 4 Spy-Pilot .. Sweet.<br />
Phylo - Ability 4 Pilot that Gives drain bonuses.<br />
Super Lando - Destiny 5, Extra Destiny Draw .. DS Lando isn&#39;t as popular so it&#39;s easier to get him out.<br />
<br />
SPECIFIC MATCHUPS<br />
This is a reactive deck and has a chance to beat anything the DS throws at you. BE SURE TO KNOW YOUR META AND PREPARE FOR IT. This version would have problems with Huntdown and Walkers.<br />
