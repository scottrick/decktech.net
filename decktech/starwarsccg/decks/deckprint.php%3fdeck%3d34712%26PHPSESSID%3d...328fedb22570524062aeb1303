*****Please read my article first before you rate this deck. <br />
<br />
Also, this is a Blueprint, if you don&#39;t have this many extra rares to provide a new player, please sub-out the cards to the best you can.*********<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, by request, I have decided to post the two example decks that I wrote about in my article; “Easiest Way to Teach a New Player.” The MBO deck is very straight forward, doing the exact same thing every game. The SYCFA deck is a bit different. It does not have the same normal game each time you play it. But, as a deck for new players to learn, it is very easy to grasp and very very fun to play. There are many options for the darkside right now, and many that are centered around the ground. To get the new player up and running, playing a deck that is completely in space is a great idea.  <br />
<br />
From my response to my MBO deck, I want to make it clear why I am going this route with new players. The reason is because of the number one reason that a new player loses, beatdown on the ground. There are hundreds of mean, cheesy, retarded things that the lightside can do out of nowhere to destroy a new player on the ground. It is MUCH different in Space. This deck provides the ability to set up and hurt the lightside with plenty of options for the new player to work with. That is why SYCFA makes for the best option for a new player. <br />
<br />
Currently, you will see two versions of SYCFA. One that plays with FearWKTIL (V) and one that flips and plays with Kuat Drive Yards (V). This deck is no where near as strong when you flip and can get a new player in trouble when they start losing battle damage at the Death Star. So I went with the Fear Version. The great thing about this deck is the way it sets up. You will probably notice that it doesn’t look like most SYCFA decks on here. I decided with my version to set up the systems a bit different from normal. Usually, you would use Commander Merrigk to get the systems and that would involve finding Admiral Piett to find him or Tarkin (V). There is no way to find Tarkin, so most people play with like 3 or 4 Imperial Commands to find Piett. They both usually end up on some random Star Destroyer or even on the Death Star until enough systems have set up. <br />
<br />
My way, there is no Imperial Commands in the deck. I decided that getting out the Executor for free in a Fear Deck was the way to go. So, I play with 6 copies of Voyeur (V) instead to pull Bespin, which gives you a good chance of getting one in your opening hand or at least your force pile first turn. I chose Voyeur over the Commands because if you are supplying the deck, it is not always easy to hand over that many of a good card. Also, it is a few less steps for the new player to worry about. It also opens up spots that you normally would have to support playing with the Commands. Merrigk is still in the deck because you don’t want to only rely on finding a Voyeur to get out the systems. This way lets you have two ways of deploying systems. PLUS, it gives you a great set up for beatdown against TRMs because you can play two of them to get 10 more activation. <br />
<br />
So, with my changes in the deck, a normal set up should look something like this:<br />
<br />
1 – Take Executor with Mob Points Combo<br />
2 – Take TMNALTC with We’re the Bait (V)<br />
3 – If you get the Voyeur (V), play to deploy ANY battleground, choosing Bespin<br />
4 – Flash Executor to find Piett, deploy them both to Bespin for 2 (Soon to change when The Professor (V) comes out)<br />
5 – Use Piett to get Merrigk or the Admiral’s Order, deploy Merrigk to Executor<br />
6 – Merrigk can pull another system, like Kashyyyk, move Executor to Kashyyyk for drain of 2<br />
7 – Use Objective to find the Death Star: Core<br />
8 – Sake Mob Points Combo to take Combat Response into hand (Save for their first turn)<br />
<br />
Now, doesn’t that just look pretty? It is so much faster and solid than the old way. “WAIT!, Hey, you searched like 80 million times, that will hurt you.” And yes, it would, but you don’t have to do anything past step 4 until next turn. This version is great because it is SO much faster getting the ships out, and it deploys much stronger ships. Every ship in the deck has a pilot that can hold a system for a battle until friends can help and EVERYONE can find their ship. It has every single mean ship the darkside has but Jabba’s Space Cruiser (V). <br />
<br />
“Ok, ok, so I get it, but this is suppose to be for newbies. How can a newbe come up with that many rares, like Emperor or Sidious???” <br />
<br />
Well, that is a good question, and as you have already read in the article. The point of these decks are meant to be built by you and then taught to the new player. I chose this deck because with the current game the way it is. The Emperor and Sidious are just not being played in that many decks. Scum, Weather Vane, Maul Deck, and Huntdown are all the most popular. Out of the four, only one (Huntdown) even uses these cards, and in a lot of Huntdown decks, they don’t even run Sidious and the Emperor is the (V) version. So that means that for most solid players out there, these two rare cards are just sitting in your bidder providing a great opportunity to lend them out. Now, if you just don’t own them or can’t afford to lend them out, then just sub them out for Lord Vaders, which can be pulled with Flagship (V) anyway. I know you guys have loads of Lord Vaders just lying around. You will be taking Vader (V) out of space, but together can hold the docking bay long enough to do some damage. Just try and get someone there who has some immunity. <br />
<br />
The rest of the deck is pretty simple. Get Fear going, deploy ships with pilots, and drain. Get a guy to the docking bay so you can get both Battle Order and Firepower (V) going or at least to get around their Battle Plan. To get Fear going, you will need to move the Death Star each turn. Until it is at Parsec 4, so it will either take four turns or two if you get R3-T6 to the Core (which is why it is in here over the War Room). I had two in here, but Fear is not that big until late game anyway, that is the reason for me choosing to move it and not just play lower Parsec systems. <br />
<br />
How to best teach this deck to a new player (ALSO APPLIES TO THE MBO Deck):<br />
<br />
1 – Go through the set up over and over and over and over again, until it becomes second nature. I literally mean, stop the game and have them do it all over again. The set up is too important to just go through a few times and have them keep asking questions every time you play a game. Once you can see they have it, move on. <br />
<br />
2 – Go through ALL the cards. Show an example for each one and explain what is does and why it is in their deck. Every time in a game, when it would be a great time to play that card, let the new player know, so when they see the same situation in one of their real games, it will look familiar. <br />
<br />
3 – By now in the teaching, they should already know the basic ideas of the rules, so you shouldn’t have to go over what to do in a normal battle. The only thing you will want to do is give good examples for the cards in the deck. When Maul is at a system, make sure they know what he does. It is weird and different, but they will pick it up faster than you think. The key is always practice and seeing the cards over and over. <br />
<br />
In time, they will become very familiar with the cards in their deck, and have no problem playing a good solid game against just about anyone. Teaching them this way will keep you from having to show them ALL of these cards that the lightside might play. They will see and experience new cards as they play more games. The key is just getting them knowing the 60 cards in their deck alone.  <br />
<br />
So there you go, another great deck for a new player to learn fast and get into the tournament scene with some kind of confidence.  <br />
