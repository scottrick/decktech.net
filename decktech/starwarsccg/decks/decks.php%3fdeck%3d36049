<br />
When virtual set 13 was released, the new Kessel locations got me thinkin. Could I make a Kessel Operatives deck that was somewhat playable in the current environment? After many on-paper revisions, and some last minute deck tweaking the night before, I brought the deck listed above to the August MN local tourney. Its got a neat engine, but could still use some fine tuning to improve its performance.<br />
<br />
Before we go any further, if youre anything like me, you probably need to brush up on your Operative rules. I saved you the trouble of opening up and searching through the AR by cut and pasting that info to the end of this strategy section. Go ahead and scroll down for a gander. Ill wait. If youd just rather have a summary, Operatives cant control a location alone, cant apply their ability toward drawing battle destiny, and have weird beta-fish movement rules.<br />
<br />
I looked at a lot of different formats for Kessel Ops before I settled on this scrub aliens with scum version. Tanks are cool, but the inability to start Droid Racks makes Combat Readiness (v) a better choice than Imperial Occupation for AATs. An Emergency Deployment version was cool, but the power bonus the Ops get on Kessel made Emergency Deployment too risky to try and base your deck on. Merc Pilots on Patrol Crafts were sweet until I actually read one of them and saw that they were only ability 1, unlike ability 2 Palace Raiders. That scuttled that. Scrub Imperials and aliens decks both have advantages, but they just dont generate enough force to be able to flip until third or forth turn at minimum. You need three sites to flip, with an Op (1 force), and optimally 4 more ability (usually 3 or 4 more force). Thats 12 to 15 force, plus the right 6 to 9 characters in your hand at that time. Its just too much to count on unless you play like 15 Ops and 30 other characters, and dont draw any force the first couple turns.<br />
<br />
Eventually I got to talking with Tyler Vastag about the deck, and mentioned I could probably make it work if I could fit the Audience Chamber and Scum And Villainy in somehow. Tyler was kind enough to point out that Scum can deploy on Jabbas Sail Barge, and the deck above congealed shortly thereafter.<br />
<br />
You cant play this deck if you live in fear of Grimtash or Thrown Back (v). Grimtash could set you back a turn or so, but you play enough Ops that you can recover. You may give up a lot of pulls to TBv if you have no choice, but in certain circumstances you can reduce the number to something a little more manageable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gameplan - Now that Im done with the rambling history (backstory) of the deck, I should probably use the strategy section to explain the strategy of the deck. Note: steps marked with an asterisk include uploads and downloads that can be skipped when playing against Thrown Back (v). The circumstances when these pulls can be skipped are described in parenthesis at the end of the step.<br />
<br />
DS Turn One<br />
*0: If you have an Abyssian Ornament in hand, use it to pull a Kessel Op if you dont have three in your hand. If you have three Kessel Ops, pull a Mercenary Pilot. (If you have three Ops in hand, just save the Ornament for a later turn.)<br />
*1: Use Ket Maliss (v) to pull Greedo, Beedo, or Hem Dazon. (Not necessary if you have enough characters in hand to flip.)<br />
2: Activate 5 force plus whatever the opponent gives you.<br />
3: Deploy Tatooine: Docking Bay 94 with Ket Maliss (v). If you dont have three Kessel Ops in your hand at this point, when looking through your reserve make note of how many Kessels Ops and Abyssian Ornaments you activated. <br />
*4: Deploy the Spaceport Docking to Kessel with Imperial Occupation. (Kessel Ops can pull your sites later, so you can skip this if you dont need the generation. My recommendation is to make this download in all but the most spartan cases, however.)<br />
5: Deploy Jabbas Sail Barge (v) with Power Of The Hutt to DB 94.<br />
*6: Use Jabbas Sail Barge to deploy the Sail Barge Passenger Deck. (Again can be skipped if you dont think youll need the generation second turn.)<br />
7: If you have three Ops in hand, DB transit the Sail Barge from Tatooine to the Spaceport DB on Kessel.<br />
8: Leave as much force in your force pile as you can this turn. Definitely draw some force though if itll get you your third Operative.<br />
<br />
LS Turn One<br />
1: At some point, use Ket Maliss (v) to get a character.<br />
<br />
DS Turn Two<br />
*1: Upload your final character with Ket Maliss (v). (Again, unnecessary if you already have enough characters to flip.)<br />
2: Activate 9 plus whatever you get from your opponent.<br />
3: Use the Sail Barge to download Jabba The Hutt (v).<br />
4: Deploy Scum And Villiany with Jabba The Hutt (v).<br />
*5: Deploy the Swamp to Kessel with Imperial Occupation. (Same deal. Can be pulled later if you dont need it to flip.)<br />
*6: Deploy the Kessel Spice Mines DB with Ket Maliss (v). (Pullable later.)<br />
7: Drop the characters in your hand to flip your objective for cheap. Operatives deploy for free, and the rest of your guys go down for one or two force. If you are going to deploy to more than three sites, flip your objective first so that you can retrieve when you deploy your extra Ops.<br />
8: Use Power Of The Hutt to deploy Jabbas Space Cruiser (v) to Kessel with a pilot from hand. With Scum out, the Space Cruiser with an Outer Rim Scout pilot costs a total of two force.<br />
*9: Use a Kessel Op to deploy your final Kessel site, the Extraction facility. (Pullable later with an Op.)<br />
<br />
Remainder of Game<br />
1: Try to get some big drains in before your opponent gets his response rolling.<br />
2: Use your objective plus Bright Center To The Universe (v) and Imperial Decree (v) to shut down your opponents damage.<br />
3: When your opponent comes to Kessel, do your best to avoid getting overflowed and kill people with multiple battle destiny. Simply avoid anyone with total immunity. Ops isnt like ROps in that as long as you occupy two Kessel sites, you stay flipped, regardless of the number of sites your opponent controls or occupies.<br />
4: Retrieve with Ability, Ability, Ability (v), Scum And Villainy, Abyssian Ornament, and by deploying Operatives.<br />
5: Eventually win the game with force drains, hopefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
Den Of Thieves (v) - Makes the deck remotely playable by protecting and maintaining the forfeit of all aliens of ability < 3, which is every character you play other than Jabba, Bane, Boba BH, and Zuckuss. When combined with Molator (v), it makes it very hard for your opponent to create any meaningful overflow against you in battle. Just remember to pull either the Oppressive Enforcement or TINT shield if suspect your opponent is playing Alter. As an added bonus, this card also adds one to each battle destiny at Banes location. Money since youll be drawing multiple destiny most of the time. Protip: DOT also protects your operatives from having their forfeit reset to 0 by the Operative shield. Still optimistic Han?<br />
<br />
Hem Dazon (v), Greedo (v), and Beedo - One of the problems with Operatives is you need other guys at the site with them in order to flip, drain, etc. If you got a bad starting hand, youd need to draw most of what you activated first and possibly second turn, probably meaning you wouldnt be able to afford to flip until the third or forth turn, which is too late to have any hope of winning. Ket Maliss (v) helps prevent this by giving you cheap guys to flip if you didnt manage to draw any. Greedo, Beedo, and Hem Dazon are all cheap and get the forfeit protection of Den of Thieves. Protip: Put salt cards on Hem Dazon at the Kessel Extraction Facility and pretend they are spice cards for added fun and endless action-packed adventures about seasonings.<br />
<br />
Jabba The Hutt (v) - Mainly in here because he pulls Scum, and Jabbas Sail Barge pulls him, and Power of the Hutt pulls the Sail Barge. After flipping, I like to leave Jabba, an operative, and a Merc Pilot on the Sail Barge at a 2/1 site. Its not unbeatable strong, but your opponent still probably wont attack them since all of your other sites are more weakly defended. Also, dont forget that you can shuttle Jabba up to Jabbas Space Cruiser in a pinch if you want to give it total immunity to attrition. Protip: If your opponent battles Jabba with a rebel, use Jabbas text to make his Operative friend power 10. You wont like Op when hes angry!<br />
<br />
Scum And Villainy - We all know what Scum does, but I put this here to remind you to remember to retrieve with Scum whenever you initiate battle. Scum will end up as one of multiple cards on the Sail Barge (inevitably the bottom one), meaning its very easy to forget and let slip from your mind after a few turns. So dont forget about it bro. Protip: Dont forget Scum when you initiate a battle, and use it to retrieve two cards.<br />
<br />
Outer Rim Scout, Sebulba, Televan Koreyy, and Vigo - These are all ability 2 alien jabronies who get protection from Den Of Thieves and are in here to help you flip and hold your sites. Outer Rim Scout is really good on the Space Cruiser, and is a smuggler for your operatives. Televan deploys for free and cancels Frozen Assets and Beggar. Vigo gets a forfeit bonus from Ket Maliss, for an irreducible forfeit of 6. Sebulbas in here cause Ive never used him in a deck before. If I was going to play this deck again, Id probably cut Sebulba, Televan, and the Vigo and play four Outer Rim Scouts, or maybe three ORS and one Vigo. Or cut all four of these and play ability 4 aliens (e.g. Aurra Sing, Brangus Glee, Djas Puhr, Grotto Werribee, EPP Mara, and Prophetess). Protip: Winners dont use Sebulba.<br />
<br />
Mercenary Pilot and Patrol Craft - Two battle destiny is good, three is better, and a reacting third destiny is more better. Put a Merc Pilot on a Patrol Craft at one of the central sites on Kessel, and react him wherever hes needed. If you cant find your patrol crafts, Merc Pilots also work slightly less effectively on the Sail Barge. The Merc Pilots are also smugglers to give your Ops their power bonus. Protip: Dont put an Operative as a passenger on the Patrol Craft or else it wont be able to react (ghost ride) around Kessel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternative Card Choices:<br />
<br />
Ephant Mon, Boelo, and Bib - These dudes are all pullable with Power of the Hutt, and have good abilities. Ephant Mon is a ghhhk and says no spies allowed. Boelo cancels a battle destiny. Reflections 3 Bib is power 6 with Jabba, which gets doubled to 12. Jabbas Palace Bib has plotting to kill Jabba in lore, so he adds 1 to all your draws with DOT (v). None of these guys are in here since POTH was a late addition over Combat Response. Also, they are ability 1 and 3, which sucks compared to ability 2 and 4 dudes.<br />
<br />
Doubles of cards in the scum pulling chain - Obviously missing pulls when you are trying to set-up first and second turn sucks, so doubles of the important cards would be nice. The important cards to consider doubles of would be DB 94, the Sail Barge, Jabba, and Scum. Of those four, Id add doubles of Jabba and Scum first, since they are second turn pulls (meaning theyre a little more likely to be activated) and can die easier than the Sail Barge or the DB.<br />
<br />
Different Admirals Orders - I played Fighters Coming In for the +1 to the DB drains, the immunity boost for the starfighters, and the saving your ships text. Other decent choices for an AO would be Battle Deployment to stop your opponent from drawing multiple destiny on Kessel, or Nothing Can Get Through Our Shield to prevent your destiny draws from being canceled. Black Sun Fleet could also be good to fly your ships around for a beatdown, or to suspend Menace Fades.<br />
<br />
Weapon Of An Ungrateful Son, Your Powers Are Weak Old Man, Overload - Bright Center To The Universe (v) effectively cancels the force drain bonuses at one location, but if your opponent spreads out their bonuses, theres little you can do to stop them chipping away at your life force. All these cards would help you against that strategy implemented via lightsabers.<br />
<br />
Some droids - When all your ability is provided by aliens, Leia Rebel Princess is a problem. So some droids would be a good addition. ECC 4-LOM and ECC Iggy are good. P-59 is good too, but his draw if unable to otherwise text doesnt jive all that well with destiny adding Ops.<br />
<br />
Tatooine Maul and the Sith Infiltrator - This combo is basically a given in any scum deck or any deck running Jabbas Space Cruiser (v), so even Im not sure how these cards didnt make the cut.<br />
<br />
Arica and EPP Mara - Also good scum cards. Mara (v) is a good strikeforce for a weakly held opponents location, and Arica can stop a drain you really need to stop (like one at Wattos Junkyard). If forced to make a choice, Id add Mara (v) before Arica.<br />
<br />
Always Thinking With Your Stomach, He Hasnt Come Back Yet - Invariably, youll end up with a total immunity Jedi (such as Mace) on Kessel that you really have no hope of killing. Its no big deal if he stays at a 1/1 location (like the swamp), but if he ends up at a 2/1 location hell be pinging you. So pack one of these cards to send him missing and solve your problem. ATWYS is probably better, but HHCBY has the benefit of playing during your turn, making it easier to retrieve by deploying an Op, allowing you to play it again later if necessary.<br />
<br />
Cold Feet (v) - Starting a non-immune to alter effect means you basically have to play Oppressive Enforcement or TINT Shield right away, leaving you with only two more shields to play. One of these would help you from getting shield busted.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there you go. Maybe the next time youre working on a light side deck, you wont be so blasé about the match-up against Deciphers shame, Operatives.<br />

Advanced Rulebook Page D-3<br />
Characteristics - Operatives<br />
Operatives are a unique kind of characteristic; only<br />
cards with "operative" in their title qualify (thus Arcona is<br />
not an operative). The other word in the operative&#39;s title<br />
will be a system; the operative is considered a<br />
&#39;matching operative&#39; for that system (e.g. Kiffex<br />
Operative is a matching operative for Kiffex).<br />
Operatives are restricted by special rules as follows:<br />
 You may not voluntarily deploy or move your operative<br />
to (or through) a location on its matching planet where<br />
you already have an operative (even if missing or<br />
captured) of the same card title.<br />
 If, at any time, two of your Operatives (even if inactive)<br />
of the same card title are at the same location on their<br />
matching planet, you must choose one to be lost (you<br />
may choose an inactive operative to be lost).<br />
 Your operative character on its matching planet may<br />
not apply its ability toward drawing battle destiny.<br />
Your operative may not control a location on its<br />
matching planet for any reason unless you have other<br />
cards with total ability of 1 or higher at that location.<br />
Your operatives still occupy that location (and may<br />
battle or be battled), but may not Force drain or flip an<br />
objective alone.<br />
