<br />
This is better than your standard scum deck for 2 or 3 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) Converts sites against objective based tatooine decks.<br />
<br />
2) Has a system for (V) Cruiser, Maul In Ship, for a drain 2, satisfying battle order, resistance, (V) firepower and tatooine occupation.<br />
<br />
3) No requirements to stay flipped or anything, no drawbacks, you just play scum outright.<br />
<br />
So now, what is this deck all about?  Carefully looking at the starting 10 you&#39;ll see a few things:<br />
<br />
Tatooine (Episode 1): Maul drains +2 here (he does not suspend scum when he is piloting).<br />
<br />
(V) All Wrapped Up:  Pulls (V) Hutt Bounty which is the most important card in the deck.<br />
<br />
(V) Jabba&#39;s Influence: Pulls aliens and makes bounty hunters power +2.  remember this.<br />
<br />
No Bargain: Stops revo and delays rebels, giving you time to set up.<br />
<br />
Power Of The Hutt: Pulls Boelo, Ephant and Jabba&#39;s Space Cruiser.  WOW.<br />
<br />
Ok, so before activating pull Hutt Bounty (V) into hand.  Then play the Oppressive Enforcement and Grabbber shields if you expect SAC.  Activate 7+whatever they give you.  If you are playing against a deck that is unlikely to battle you turn 1, you can download (V) jabba by the AC, he pulls scum, then you use power of the hutt to pull EPHANT MON (he&#39;s stronger than Boelo) and then pull another alien (i usually start with urururururur scott&#39;s broken card) to set up the chamber.  urururur is technically free w/ scum out cuz he cost 1, then puts a card in force pile.<br />
<br />
When going through your deck, count your evasion cards to see the likelyhood that any may be drawn this turn.  Evasion early in this deck is absolutely awesome, especially if you barrier someone in the audience chamber (cough cough john anderson cough cough) and then you can beat them down severely w/ (V) Jabba&#39;s gametext the following turn, and retrieve with scum to boot.  I was able to accomplish beatdowns of 47 and 101 overflow, winning me 2 games.<br />
<br />
Now you will say &quot;but what if they just leave the AC alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well...that would be wise.  But you&#39;d be surprised how often people think they can disrupt you.  Well, to be frank, if you play this right, they simply cannot.<br />
<br />
But for the time being, lets say they leave the AC alone and focus elsewhere, say space for example.  Now you get to download (V) Space Cruiser (probably the most broken ship in the game) and download an alien pilot on it (generally (V) lando) all for the price of 3 force total w/ scum.  Not horrible for a power 8 ship that lets you download every other ship for free.<br />
<br />
So lets say, the LS player is smart enough not to be initiating battles against this cruiser.  Well, then YOU get to initiate, triggering Scum and hopefully First Strike (if Draw Their Fire is also out, remember that every battle you initiate is a SIX FORCE SWING).<br />
<br />
Also remember, if they deploy anyone anywhere and do not play Insurrection, elis helrot jabba the hutt beatdown can potentially end the game at any moment.  Monnok is good for checking for evasion cards.<br />
<br />
(V) All Wrapped Up lets your bounty hunters capture forfeited characters, this doesn&#39;t seem huge once you do beatdowns, but it can be potentially.<br />
<br />
(V) Jabba&#39;s Influence:  Makes bounty hunters power +2 (which lets you get bigger (V) Jabba beatdowns).<br />
<br />
Card choices beyond startup:<br />
<br />
Jabba&#39;s Palace: Lower Corridor man relocating with this site is awesome<br />
<br />
2x (V) Jabba The Hutt: Broken<br />
<br />
Prince Xizor: He&#39;s a gangster so he can make power = 0 with (V) Hutt Bounty as well as Jabba.<br />
<br />
2x Laser Cannon Battery: You can react with this and shoot down Bright Hope and (V) Tantive IV.<br />
<br />
(V) Hutt Bounty = Best Card Ever.  Go read it, you&#39;ll be amazed.<br />
<br />
2x Tatooine Occupation: HOW many scum decks can run this card???  This only adds insult to injury.<br />
<br />
First Strike: SO good.  My 101 overflow beatdown of John Anderson was brought to you by this card.<br />
<br />
3x (V) None Shall Pass: Stops quigon.<br />
<br />
2x Elis Helrot: beatdowns<br />
<br />
2x Masterful Move & Endor Occupation: cancel savrip, pull molator or monnok<br />
<br />
2x Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch: capture boushhh or a gifted droid<br />
<br />
3x Imperial Barrier: barrier is awesome.  just ask john anderson ;-).<br />
<br />
Well that&#39;s about it, check it out feel free to ask me questions.  To everyone, good luck with SWCCG.  I wish you all well, I&#39;ll put together some sort of TR for MD probably.<br />
