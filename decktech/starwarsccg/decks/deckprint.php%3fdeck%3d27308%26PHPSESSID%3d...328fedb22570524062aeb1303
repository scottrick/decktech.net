<br />
<br /><br />
Starting Setup:<br />
<br />
Start your objective, and the 3 locations it deploys.  Play Prepared Defenses to start Mob Points, IAO combo, and Combat Response.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Early Game:<br />
<br />
Pull the Executor with Mob Points.  On your first turn, you&#39;ll want to deploy the Executor docking bay, and the Death Star war room.  Use the 4 commands to help you get Piett, so that he can get Merrejk, so that he can start pulling your systems.  (Come With Me can help a lot, because if you have any Admiral, you can plop that card on them, and pull Merrejk with it, freeing up Piett to pull your Admiral&#39;s Order.  You can then use Come With Me to pull everyone else you need.)  Get the Executor down to Fondor and start piling it up.  If you can, try to get an Emperor to the Death Star Docking Bay before long, as that will basically add 3 to your generation.  Since he is immune to attrition (thanks to his text) and immune to battle damage (thanks to your objective) and since there are no built-in lightsabers, it is quite likely that he ain&#39;t going anywhere.  Remember to start moving the Death Star from your very first turn.  You&#39;ll eventually want to get it as far as Parsec 6.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Mid Game:<br />
<br />
The two twilek advisors are very handy for this deck, as they serve several important functions.  If you don&#39;t draw Captain Lennox, the Twileks can help you get Come With Me (v), which can deploy him from reserve deck.  If you don&#39;t get the Imperial Domination (v), you&#39;ll need to pull that from reserve deck.  And if you don&#39;t draw one of the two copies of Fear Will Keep Them in Line (v), you&#39;ll need to try and pull them from reserve deck.  That order should be your priority (Come With Me, Domination, Fear).  With luck, you&#39;ll have the Emperor at your Death Star Docking Bay by now, to satisfy Battle Order and provide extra activation, and Merrejk should have pulled your systems.  On your first turn, you used your objective to pull the War Room.  Since Come With Me was your top Twilek priority, you should have Lennox aboard the Executor before too long.  Come With Me can also be used to pull Motti and/or Ozzel, if you didn&#39;t happen to draw them or Command for them.  The Death Squadron Destroyers are naturally deploy -2 to same location as the Executor.  Lennox makes them another -3.  Motti makes them another -2, while Ozzel and Piett can each make them -1.  So now you are deploying Star Destroyers for free that have built-in immunity to attrition, and ability 2 permanent pilots.  Transfer some of your excess pilots (the Executor doesn&#39;t need many) to these ships, and spread to your systems so that Chiraneau can begin to turn the screws, while the Death Star moves further out, so that Fear can do its damage.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Late Game:<br />
<br />
The Saber Squadron can help you blast away your opponent&#39;s starships, if (for some reason) the Star Destroyers aren&#39;t already mangling them.  Extra destiny from the Baron makes sure that you can pretty much draw 2 destiny in space anywhere.  (Admiral + Command = 2.  Baron + anyone else = 2.  Thrawn on a Destroyer = 2.)  Use the Vaders to repeatedly attack your opponent at their sites.  With all these hordes of battles you&#39;re initiating, both on the ground and in the air, your characters (and your opponent&#39;s characters) will be dying left and right.  This is clearly where the Domination (v) comes in.  Every time you initiate, you get an Imperial back.  Every time you win a battle (even if your opponent initiated it), you get another Imperial back.  So on the ground, whenever you drop a Vader to initiate a battle, use the Domination to retrieve the previous Vader.  (he does not need to be the Imperial who is closest to the top) and in space, well...winning battles is easy with star destroyers, so you should retrieve plenty of guys that way as well.  You&#39;ve created a neverending loop of guys, guys, and more guys, that you just keep throwing at your opponent until there is no opposition left.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Questions answered:<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Why regular Mobilization Points instead of the combo version?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Well, there is no DDTA in this format, so you can expect to get the full +2 activation from Mob Points most of the time.  And with so few weapons in the format, the defense value -1 to Jedi isn&#39;t as useful.  Inserts are already banned, so no worries there.  You&#39;ll be putting someone at a docking bay early (like Piett/Merrejk, for instance) and you&#39;re going to want someone at a docking bay for the long haul (Emperor) so the extra activation really adds up over the long run.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Is there enough activation for all these huge characters and even bigger starships?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
You better believe it.  You&#39;ve got 13 dark side icons on your locations, plus 1 on the Emperor, and as much as 4 from Mobilization Points.  So that&#39;s 18, without your opponent giving you even one.  The First Strike combo lets you initiate battles for free, so you&#39;re bound to be able to deploy your big guns and still have force to pay for aim high when you retrieve.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Too Cold for Speeders?  Bright Center to the Universe?  Isn&#39;t all this Local Uprising hate a bit much for just ONE deck?  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
NO.  That deck is a monster.  It deserves to be teched against already.  Once they are flipped, they will lose only 1 force to Fear Will Keep Them in Line.  That&#39;s not cool.  Sure, you can drain them for a ton in space, but you need cards like these to slow them down, so that you have a chance of staying ahead in the damage race.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
What about those EBO/HB Flip hybrid decks?  Aren&#39;t X-Wings more powerful than star destroyers and matching TIEs with Cannons?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
NO.  And they can&#39;t drain you much if you keep killing their ships.  But if you&#39;re particularly scared of that decktype (as some people seem to be), then you can add the virtual versions of Krayt Dragon Bones and One-Arm to your deck.  Start the Bones instead of Combat Response, use it to pull One-Arm from reserve deck, and laugh as he runs around and eats every last guy in the Echo Base.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Is this a better Classic deck than the ISB one you posted?  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
NO.  There IS no Classic deck better than that.  But this one is more fun.  :)  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Why base a deck around Imperial Domination?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Cuz retrieving a character every time you initiate a battle AND every time you win a battle is just plain INSANE!  You&#39;ll never run out of guys, and the card can never be cancelled, not even by Alter.  This would already be a good card, even if the retrieval were all it did.  But it&#39;s NOT.  Not by a long shot.  It also lets you take your destiny draw into hand and cause a redraw any time you draw an Imperial for destiny.  That&#39;s not just battle destiny, mind you, but ANY destiny!  Drew a low-destiny character for Vader&#39;s saber?  Take it into hand and cause a re-draw.  Low-destiny character for the Baron&#39;s gun?  Take that sucker into hand and re-draw.  Missed with Vader&#39;s choke text?  Re-draw!  It just ain&#39;t right, I tell ya.  And heaven forbid you should ever get Janus down with the Emperor.  Every time you drop Choke Vader to battle someone, you retrieve one of the other Choke Vaders when you initiate.  Next time you activate, just track down to the Vader you retrieved, and pop him into hand with Janus.  Slap him down, battle, retrieve the previous Vader.  IT JUST AIN&#39;T RIGHT!  Not to mention that right after you forfeit Vader, if you&#39;re going to battle somewhere else that turn, you can just go ahead and retrieve him the same turn you lost him.  It&#39;s crazy!  And don&#39;t worry about Vader&#39;s immunity keeping you from losing him.  You can always forfeit him to any battle damage or any attrition, even when he&#39;s immune.  To keep him on the table, they&#39;d have to decline their destiny draw altogether, and if they do that, it means a few things.  One, you&#39;ll probably win the battle and retrieve another guy!  Second, if they don&#39;t draw destiny, and then you draw high, they might be looking at some nasty overflow, especially if Tarkin or the Saber are around.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Will it be hard to occupy more locations than my opponent?<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Not really.  You&#39;ve got 8 locations of your own.  You&#39;ll want someone (like the Emperor) at the DS docking bay.  You&#39;ll want ships at all 3 of your battleground systems.  You will probably leave someone at the Exec DB for much of the game, for the extra activation.  That&#39;s 5 locations, plus the one that you&#39;re deploying Vader to attack at.  This should not be a problem.  If your opponent is somehow managing to spread thin without leaving themselves wide open to a heinous beatdown (which isn&#39;t easily done), then you could always put something at the Death Star system, or War Room (or both) to make sure you stay ahead in the number of locations occupied. <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
What if they won&#39;t confront me in space at all?  Won&#39;t that break the loop of retrieval, and shut the deck down?  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Not at all.  If they don&#39;t confront you in space, you&#39;ve already won.  Nothing can withstand all the damage from the icons in space, plus Chiraneau, plus Fear damage.  If you don&#39;t expect much confrontation in space, then put fewer of your pilots up there.  Instead, just lose them to drains and retrieve them when you battle on the ground.  You don&#39;t have to worry about drawing those low destiny cards for destiny later, because you can just take them into hand and redraw.  Then lose them to drains, then retrieve them...etc. <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Card choices:<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Systems:  Fondor lets the Executor come down for -5.  Endor and Sullust are each drains of 2, plus 1 if Chiraneau says so.  Keeping Menace Fades out of the picture probably won&#39;t be too tough with all those star destroyers and TIE cannons around.  Endor is also +1 for them to deploy or move to, and Sullust can cost someone 8 force if you cancel Haven.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Vaders:  Since you can&#39;t use EPP Vader, Choke Vader is the next best thing.  He still has good odds of taking down two characters at a time, since it isn&#39;t real likely that they&#39;ll have two high-ability characters together, when there are no epps, and no Qui-Gons.  The fact that you can redraw your choke destiny sometimes certainly helps.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Arica:  Since she is an Imperial, she won&#39;t cause the Domination to be lost.  Can block a drain to buy you time while you search for the next Guy/Walker/Vader to attack with (or for that matter, she can BE the next "guy" you attack with), or can initiate beatings at places where you have no icons.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Tarkin:  If your opponent piles up characters to try and keep you from winning battles, then choking someone and then drawing two destiny can help to break up the clump.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Motti/Lennox:  Dirt cheap Star Destroyers.  &#39;Nuff said.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
We&#39;re in Attack Position Now:  All of your Star Destroyers have immunity, so you might as well raise it.  Also lets your pilots deploy aboard your ships for -1 (-2 if they are Admirals, and a lot of them are)  Can also be used to replace ITTL.    <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Fear Will Keep Them in Line:  Opponent not battling you enough in space?  Can&#39;t forfeit the guys from your ships so that you can retrieve them?  No problem.  If they aren&#39;t fighting you in space, then Chiraneau is murdering them, and Fear will just make it all the worse.  This card ENDS GAMES.  QUICKLY.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
There&#39;ll Be Hell to Pay:  Since your basic strategy on the ground is "Deploy guy to your site.  Battle.  Deploy guy to your site.  Battle.  Deploy guy to your site.  Battle.", Rebel Barrier can be annoying.  So grab it.  Can also grab ICBW or any other interrupt that is making you unhappy.  <br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Sunsdown/Too Cold for Speeders:  Battling those speeders is no fun when they keep reacting to each other.  You need to remove their landspeed, then you can say "Deploy guy to your site.  Battle."  And since they&#39;ll also be power zero, you&#39;re bound to win the battle, and retrieve another guy...<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Bright Center to the Universe:  Since the DS docking bay is not a "planet site", there are no planet sites in the deck, and hence you cannot set up decree.  Deploying Bright Center on the Death Star offers a much simpler solution to the problem of those speeder decks that like to drop the shield, play T-47 Battle Formation, and drain you for a zillion.  Just cancel all their drain bonuses with this card, and make sure to keep a ship at the Death Star to protect it from being cancelled.<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Give the deck a whirl.  I can&#39;t imagine that you wouldn&#39;t enjoy the experience.  :)<br />
