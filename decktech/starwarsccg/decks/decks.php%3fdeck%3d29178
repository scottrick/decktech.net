As many reviews just made me notice, I forgot the weapons.<br />
There area:<br />
<br />
VADER&#39;S LIGHTSABER (x3)<br />
LASER CANNON BATTERY (x2)<br />
<br />
This is obviously very important to the deck, sorry but I was too busy checking tags to notice them. <br />
These weapons work great in tandem with Weapon Levitation, of course, and since there is the Womp Rat attack every turn, you have more than usual chances to see them in your Used Pile (attack destiny being shown and going to Used Pile).<br />
Add the Trooper Sabacc for more "cards" in Used that you&#39;re seeing and you get the whole picture.<br />
I decided not to post again the deck because I&#39;m not here for tech points. Just to share.<br />
And obviously the Judicator is just a monster in this deck:<br />
Judicator + Darth Vader (V) + Grand Moff Tarkin --> A power 14 ISD that draws a battle destiny, cancels one (even a weapon destiny if wished), substract 3 from another, and is immune to attrition <5 (counting the -3, it means <8).<br />
You can deploy a Laser Cannon BAttery (even as a react) and shoot at +2 for FREE vs. Capitals or at +0 for FREE vs. Starfighters. Any starfighter hit is power 0. You can add up to 3 to the weapon destiny draw, so hitting the Outrider is a piece of cake, and even maneuver 6 starfighters are not so difficult. (remember, you can redraw a low imperial destiny with Imperial Domination)<br />
Soon you&#39;ll understand why in my report (end of week)<br />
<br />
<b><u> END UPDATE </b></u><br />
<br />
<b><u>Strategy:</b></u><br />
<br />
<u>Overall:</u><br />
<br />
The goal of this deck is to put pressure on your opponent early (like any HDADTJ) but with some abuse in it. I called this abuse the <i>"Womp Rat Theory"</i>.<br />
With this abuse you can draw characters (imperials) without using force. Each turn.<br />
The abuse continues with the addition of another great card (often overlooked): the <i>Stormtrooper Cadet</i>.<br />
<br />
<i><u>Ok, ok but what is this "Womp Rat Theory" ???</i></u><br />
<br />
It is basically:  <i><b>Krayt Dragon Bones (V)</i></b> starting, and a ferocious Womp Rat dangling on an annoyed Darth Vader&#39;s arm while <i><b>Imperial Domination (V)</i></b> is on table.<br />
Womp Rats deploy everywhere. There are "ferocious", they are deploy 2 (0 with KDB virtual), and go to any exterior planet site (even hoth or dagobah, which is totally cheesy since they are desert creatures). <br />
For more details, heres the link:<br />
http://www.decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/specialedition/dark/large/womprat.html<br />
So usually what happens is that you drop Vader "somewhere" 1st or 2nd turn and you add a Womp Rat for good measure there (from your Reserve usually). Since the deck&#39;s starting with Imperial Domination (V), what happens is that the Womp Rat will look at Vader like he was a can of meat and will try to eat him EACH battle phase (yours and opponent&#39;s), basically drawing "attack" destiny while Vader defends himself drawing also "attack" destiny. <br />
There are nearly NO chance that the Womp Rat will eat Vader due to careful deck construction. Basically from these 2 destinies EACH turn, one of them has a good chance to be an Imperial (possible since the deck has 20 Imperials there), and you can take him into hand with Imperial Domination (V).<br />
<br />
<i><u>hmmm.. nice but what about these Stormtrooper Cadets ???</i></u><br />
<br />
Props have to be given to Bruce Wayne (a cool england guy I met in 1998) for having explained to me the power of Cadets 5 years ago I did never forgive them, and this deck is not the only top-level deck that I use with them.<br />
This card is not commonly seen, so here is the link: <br />
http://www.decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/sealeddeck/large/stormtroopercadet.html<br />
Good destiny combined with a nice <b>free</b> deploy if with <b>leader</b> and attrition absorption.<br />
Since playing with Imperial Domination (V) basically tells you to play only with Imperials, much of the nice Imperials are leaders, so this card fits nicely, especially in the current environment.<br />
And even more if you can retrieve them with Imperial Domination (V) when you initiate or win a battle, track them, and get them into hand in a blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
<i><u>Ok, in synthesis, what happens ???</i></u><br />
<br />
Well, basically you have the classic pressure of HDADTJ right from the start, and you have also the ability, in a FULL turn (DS and LS) to pick up to 2 imperials from 4 cards without having to draw from the Force Pile (so you&#39;re free to use the Force to drain, to deploy, and so on). <br />
These imperials are "damage" to be retrieved (so you actually win games with more margin), and also help to keep a strong supply of characters to win battles (thus retrieving even more imperials).<br />
Which is even more easy since you can quickly destroy opponent&#39;s characters with creature attacks.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Starting Effects:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Conduct Your Search</b>: this effect is important, it lets you get a Battleground for Vader (if the opponent doesn&#39;t give you any) where he will drain for 2 (3 with saber), or you can play someone else there (Emperor with Janus is a good choice, or any vehicle with someone aboard) to drain while you battle elsewhere.<br />
This effect lets you deploy  also Blast Door Controls, which just ends any non-sense with Rebel Barrier or Narrow Escape / Blast The Door, Kid! right away.<br />
(add the fact that there are 2 Stop Motion (V) and a Tautaun Skull to pull them in the deck and you have more than a standing chance to win vs. Light Side Combat)<br />
<b>Krayt Dragon Bones (V)</b>: your Womp Rats are ferocity 2+destiny, and it can increase up to 4+destiny if you play all 3 together (you can do it). They deploy for <b>FREE</b>, can kill annoying little characters, let you abuse Imperial Domination (V), and eat any Undercover spies that present themselves. So, what do you need more ???<br />
If the opponent plays on <b>interior</b> Hoth sites, just drop the Wampa(V) inside and around.<br />
<b>Imperial Domination (V)</b>: the card abused. You just have to prevent the opponent from occupying more locations than you. With creatures and all the characters around, it can be possible.<br />
You retrieve 1 Imperial when you start a battle, you retrieve 1 Imperial when you win a battle. It goes on and on.<br />
With Womp Rats attacks you get some more option to get these imperials into hand, and with Janus Greejatus too.<br />
This retrieval works nice with HDADTJ (Visage damage), or any other kind of drains/damage.<br />
<br />
From time to time, you can start with No Escape instead of another effect, but really usually it is not to be done.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Strategy:</b></u><br />
<br />
Easy but efficient.<br />
Deploy the Endor: Back Door and drain with Vader there, adding his lightsaber. Or put a Walker with a pilot (leader) and a Cadet to hold the site (or just Emperor with Janus) if the fight to the opponent&#39;s site will be at interior sites.<br />
Wherever is Vader, deploy a Womp Rat there for FREE and start abusing Imperial Domination (V). <br />
Wherever the opponent deploys on ground, kill/prepare beatdown with creatures and battle them, retrieving more imperials, and winning more easily battles.<br />
Deploy the Imperial: Holotable for more generation, and use the force to deploy and fight (you don&#39;t really need much to draw cards, since you will draw characters with Imperial Domination(V)), and to drain if Battle Plan is on table.<br />
<br />
To protect vs. weapons, you have vehicles, the Stormtrooper Garrison, and Overload.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Notes:</b></i><br />
<br />
<i><u>1) No destiny 7 (but for another Visage):</i></u><br />
This may seems at first hand stupid. It is not. Having too many destinies 7 in your deck means that by trying to abuse Imperial Domination (V) with Vader and a Womp Rat you might end up with Vader eaten, since a Womp Rat alone is ferocity 2+destiny (thanks, alas, to Krayt Dragon Bones (V)). <br />
Since Lord Vader&#39;s power is 7, the creature needs to draw a "6" to have the barest chance to eat him. And Vader would have to draw a "0".<br />
The only "6" in the deck are Emperors and Stop Motion (V).<br />
And the only "0" are Ozzel (x2) and the Imperial Holotable. The Imperial Holotable should be deployed quickly (also thanks to MM&EO).<br />
So besides the slim chances for this event to happen, both "6" and "0" remaining are Imperials, so you can make a redraw by just taking the destiny into hand with Imperial Domination (V).<br />
Now, there is a "7", and this is another Visage. Knowing that it is the only "7" in the deck is somewhat reassuring. Just track it (like you should be tracking "0" anyway) and you&#39;ll be fine. Or drop it to the Holotable.<br />
<br />
<i><u>2) 2 Womp Rats under the SE and 1 Womp Rat in the deck. Why ?</i></u><br />
Simply because you can take it with Krayt Dragon Bones (V), and it allows you to deploy all 3 in the same turn, together. People will expect a Bubo attack, but not a TRIPLE attack with 3 selectives Womp Rats at ferocity 4+destiny. This can also unflip WYS pretty quickly. <br />
<br />
<i><u>3) Why Womp Rats at all ?</i></u><br />
Because Bubo doesn&#39;t attack your characters, because Bubo doesn&#39;t draw destiny, so no Imperial Domination (V) abuse. Because the image is cool. Because they&#39;re free with Krayt Dragon Bones (V). Because they&#39;re selective. Because they eat Nudjs and undercover spies for breakfast. Oh, and by the way did you ever see Womp Rats at Hoth or Dagobah ? No ?<br />
When the opponent will move Daughter Of Skywalker away for testing, just drop 3 Womp Rats on her. And watch her die.<br />
<br />
<i><u>4) Why no Blizzard 1 (V) or Blizzard 2 (V) ?</i></u><br />
Card choices. Both Tempest 1 and Dune Walker allow Igar to draw 2 destinies. Blizzard 1 (V) has no pilots aboard, so you need an extra pilot to use it in battles.<br />
<br />
<i><u>5) Presence Of The Force ?</i></u><br />
Yes. Puts some pressure on the opponent, let&#39;s you beat them at 1/0 or 2/0 sites, and so on. It&#39;s like Mara Jade but it doesn&#39;t cost Force and it adds to your drains once you&#39;ve beaten the poor guy (making the site a BG, so no Honor Of The Jedi).<br />
<br />
<i><u>6) Endor: Back Door ? Don&#39;t you fear Fallen Portal ?</i></u><br />
No I don&#39;t. While I&#39;m not playing They&#39;re Still Coming Through!, Lord Vader with weapon is still defense value 8 so the opponent should draw a blind 7 to kill him. It just won&#39;t happen. And all other characters will be inside vehicles. The number of LS players or decks still using Fallen Portal are very rare, anyway.<br />
<br />
<i><u>7) 2 Ozzel ?</i></u><br />
Yes, the guy deploys for 0. He&#39;s a leader, he&#39;s a pilot. This means that he can pilot the Judicator easily, that you can add a Cadet for FREE as back-up, and so on. He is also destiny "0", which is great for tracking with Overload. And since you can lose him in battles without worrying, then, with Imperial Domination (V), it will just be retrieved first choice for some other tracking.<br />
<br />
<i><u>8) 2 Janus ?</i></u><br />
This Imperial makes the decks really strong. You need to be able to pick up Cadets retrieved quickly if you wish to hold a site. Allows also for easy tracking of important cards, and some more drawing.<br />
<br />
<i><u>9) Tautaun Skull ?</i></u><br />
Tautaun Skull allows you to get Stop Motion (V) into hand. This function, alone, doesn&#39;t justify the use of this card, even if it lets you beatdown more quickly. The real power is that it just fits perfectly the deck. You will be using Womp Rats. And Womp Rats, sooner or later, get killed. And since they are not Imperials, you won&#39;t retrieve them with Imperial Domination (V). So why not to use them when they are in the lost pile ? Use Tautaun Bones, and you get an extra 5 power, for free, in a battle by putting out of play a Womp Rat from your lost pile. This is huge. It can be used on ground, in space, everywhere. The Emperor could be also sacrificed that way, to add 6. It can also be used to defend your Womp Rats when they get attacked. If the opponent has no weapons, but just wants to outpower one of your sweet creatures, you just play Tautaun Skull, and there you are with a Womp Rat with ferocity total of 2+destiny+4+5(0r 6) = 11 (or 12) + destiny.<br />
It can be used also like a small Ghhhk no-one&#39;s expecting. And it helps absorbing battle damage when the Cadet is absorbing the attrition (but you&#39;re still losing the battle).<br />
And since it will make you win battles, you will retrieve another Imperial.<br />
<br />
<i><u>10) Blizzard Scout 1 (V) ?</i></u><br />
Good card. I was playing it all the time in my first HDADTJ and it just became better. &#39;React&#39; ability, destiny 4, protection from lightsabers, deploy 3 and forfeit 5, with cancel game text ability is just plainly powerful.<br />
<br />
<i><u>11) Masterful Move & Endor Occupation (x2)</i></u><br />
I&#39;m not using the non-combo version because it is destiny 6 (danger for creature attacks) and because I prefer to be able to cancel Celebration/Mantellian Savrip whenever possible. I&#39;m using 2 copies because you never know, and because I like to deploy quickly the Holotable.<br />
<br />
<i><u>12) Overload (x2) ?</i></u><br />
This interrupt is money. I probably wouldn&#39;t fit 2 in the deck if it wasn&#39;t for Imperial Domination (V). Tracking Ozzel so easily means that you can quickly blow up any EPPs or Mains with weapon. It just adds for some beatdown probability. Even starships can blow up that way, meaning that no-one will be able to Power Pivot you, or to blow away your ISD with Intruder Missiles. Even Power Harpoon will just blow up, or any other thing that you can think off.<br />
<br />
<i><u>13) Trooper Sabacc ?</i></u><br />
This is a new one. Since the deck is playing some 11 leaders, and 4 troopers, and that usually the trooper stays on table, I could as well play this interrupt. It messes with tracking, and since I think that I will be able to make perfect sabaccs at least 80% of the time, it is another 2 Force loss to the opponent. Track it back with Janus, it can be quickly abused.<br />
Great to leave the opponent without a destiny draw.<br />
This card was a last minute <b><u>FUN</b></u> choice. You can take them out for more meta-oriented cards.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Deck Match-ups:</b></u><br />
<br />
<u>Space or Mains HB</u>: start the usual 3.<br />
When ready, drop Vader (+ lightsaber) to Back: Door, add a Womp Rat for free from Fear Is My Ally, and start the fun. <br />
Against X-Wing swarm it might be difficult, but you might damage the deck enough before they can kill you. <br />
The key in this match-up, if you wish to go to space, is to somehow put Darth Vader (V) on the Judicator. Add Tarkin aboard and you have a power 14 ISD, immune <5, which cancels one BD just drawn, and substract 3 from any other. To make it short, the opponent needs a weapon, 3 Battle Destinies, or to overpower it to take it down. Obviously with the Laser Cannon Batteries the Judicator becomes even more threatening.<br />
Tarkin can cancel also one weapon destiny, so all in all, coupled with Overload, there is very little the opponent will be able to do to deal with this beast.<br />
To put Vader aboard, you have a few options:<br />
- simply shuttle him up from the Back: Door to the Endor system. Every half-decent HB plays Endor as a system.<br />
- if HDADTJ is not flipped,  take Vader into hand with the objective&#39;s game text.<br />
- let the Womp Rat eat Vader in your opponent&#39;s battle phase (difficult since it requires a lot of luck/tracking since you cannot opt not to draw attack destiny, but it can be done with some tricks, like no force left in the Reserve)<br />
- simply because Vader is not on table, so you can deploy another one.<br />
Also, a Judicator with the &#39;react&#39; ability of Laser Cannon Battery is a perfect match vs. S-Foils (then just drop Crossfire Shield).<br />
<br />
<u>WYS</u>: laugh. ^_^. Start the usual 3. Possibly drop Vader at Cantina first turn to start the damage, or drop it at the Back Door with a Womp Rat. Stay calm and start building up some Force. The opponent will flip, surely with someone on the ground. Get Womp Rats from Fear Is My Ally and wreck havoc with some beatdown on the poor smugglers. If they manage to run away, follow them with your creatures (it works best if all are Womp Rats, since they are selective creatures). They might kill one, but the other will just finish their meal.<br />
You will own ground (since not even the combo Han with Enraged Chewie will be able to be played), so damaging the opponent will be a piece of cake. Prepare for the space battle. It is not that important, since with ground predominance you should win, but vs. space versions you will have to be wary. Drop the Judicator with some Cannon Laser Batteries to shoot the Outrider, because he is NOT nice, and deal with the space force that way (if you shoot first it will be power 0 before he reduces your power). I highly recommend packing some forfeit aboard and to abuse Tautaun Skull. Shuttle up Vader if needed.<br />
Remember also Overload to deal vs. Power Pivot.<br />
Blizzard Scout 1 (V) is huge in this match-up. I beated in a tournament a WYS space deck thanks to the Judicator. It is huge.<br />
Against the WYS Raiders version, then play a little more attentively. I would play the Stormtrooper Garrison with Vader inside the Cantina, while playing Walkers around. Walkers deal nicely vs. Patrol Crafts, especially with Cadets. You can&#39;t do anything vs. Bacta Tank, but Imperial Domination (V) is just about the same. Trooper Sabacc all the way, you should get some nice Patrol Crafts and help with the damage race.<br />
<br />
<u>LU/L(V)</u>: start the usual 3. Keep as soon as possible some pressure to Endor: Back Door with a Vader and Womp Rat there (get it from Reserve). Then prepare for the invasion: combat vehicles will give you nice power while protecting from Ice Storm. Overload protects you from Harpoons. Cadets protect against any destiny cracking your Blizzard immunity, and Crossfire can help you deal vs. the non-(V) version of Maneuvring Flaps if you see it at the Back: Door. The Womp Rat is important against this match-up, since it will allow you to draw characters to battle and face the LS.<br />
Don&#39;t forget to drop the Wampa and move him into Echo sites if the opponent is hiding there with Romas &#39;Lock&#39; Navender (V) (to drop the Shield), and move the other Womp Rats around Hoth if the opponent has left somehow some characters there. If the opponent cannot drop down the shield, then you can block his force drains (not the damage, ok, but it is a fair trade) with Come Here You Big Coward (Shield), even if the opponent takes you off of the 4th Marker (since you will occupy and control the Back Door).<br />
LU(V)/L is quick. And you have nothing to stop the reacts. Stay with your combat vehicles at the 4th Marker to prevent any back flip of HDADTJ.<br />
Play Trooper Sabacc every time you can.<br />
<br />
<u>QMF</u>: Start No Escape instead of Krayt Dragon Bones (V). The strategy can be quite different here It depends on our starting hand. It can be Force Choking (no deploy of the Back: Door and just storming opponent&#39;s locations) or putting pressure on Endor: Back Door right from the start (while keeping an AT-AT there). Most vehicles will be useless (since all LS sites should be interior), and there will be nasty interrupts like Sorry About The Mess and Path Of Least Resistance. I think the strategy is to hit the opponent hard in the beginning: drain, damage, when he deploys, just deploy Blast Door Controls and hit again, grab any annoying interrupt, and so on Stop Motion (V) any Arconas or Dodge when the opponent drops Celebration, just use Endor Occupation, and if ready, drop the Judicator (keep an Overload in hand) to hit the opponent hard. If the opponent is not too much pressed, don&#39;t spread, just keep control of 1 site and the system, and drain there (you should be able to drain from 4 at least to 7).<br />
I have to say that a Ghhhk would be in handy. ^_^<br />
<br />
<u>Throne Room</u>: they will activate a ton and will try to come at your sites. They might even succeed. <br />
Against the Revolution version there is small hope, so I won&#39;t even deal with it. (just meta for it taking out the Sabacc and adding Crush and Evader/Monnok)<br />
Start the usual 3, since the LS won&#39;t start YISYW to grab Honor (if they do, just start No Escape instead of Imperial Domination (V)). Deploy the Back Door, and if possible the Holotable.<br />
The good point against Throne Room is that it will be a quick game, and that you are deciding where it will be fought: at the Back Door. You get to have some activation going, and to drop whatever you can to the Back Door. <br />
Senses and Alters will have a hard time passing through (because of the +4). If Visage gets cancelled, don&#39;t drop another. The Come Here You Big Coward Shield is what you should count on so keep occupied your BG site. The problem in this match-up is Colo Claw Fish. For this reason, I would try not to put characters outside vehicles, but just inside, with some Trooper Cadets, and just to absorb attrition that way (this way you won&#39;t lose power but the opponent will) while Tautaun Bones should help you by sacrificing Womp Rats and Emperors to fill the eventual power gap.  <br />
The creatures then might help you a lot. By dropping 3 Womp Rats, each of them is ferocity destiny+4 (and deploy free) you might get lucky. <br />
When possible, use Imperial Domination (V) to retrieve some crucial imperials, and Blizzard Scout 1 (V) is the card that must stay alive at all costs, cancelling nasty game text out of the opponent&#39;s cards. <br />
<br />
<u>LS Combat</u>: any version can make HDADTJ cry. Do not start Krayt Dragon Bones (V), start No Escape instead. In this match-up the best lay-out is a AT-AT at the Back Door with a pilot leader and a Cadet to drain for 2 without problems for the rest of the game. As for Naboo sites, just accumulate some force and attack with Vader and company. You better wait a couple turn to get the right cards into hand.<br />
Deploy Blast Door Controls with Conduct Your Search (it will make the opponent think and pray for a Dodge, since it can&#39;t be easily Altered due to HDADTJ).<br />
And when ready, battle with everything you have. You have to outpower the opponent here, and by a lot. With 2 Stop Motion (V) and a Tautaun Skull, you can do it with a pretty big chance of success. If the opponent manages to live through it (highly possible), know that you don&#39;t have to deploy another Jedi to keep hold of the site. Just play IFYLOFD(V) shield to keep any instant killing of your characters and simply overpower the opponent each time, retrieving Imperials that way. There are many chances that the fight will happen at the Theed Palace Generator, where your drains are at 1. Just drop a Presence of The Force and the Stormtrooper Garrison (it doesnt suffer too much from Heroic Sacrifice(V)) to get a whooping 3 drain, a lot of power, and 2 BD. If you manage to take the control of the other Naboo site, then the drain can be even more lethal (5 a turn) but the Stormtrooper Garrison will go to the Used Pile quite quickly (being hit), but at least your other leaders will be protected. Just take it back into hand with Janus and deploy him again.<br />
There also won&#39;t be much time to set up, so take any opportunity to play dirty tricks like Overload with tracked destinies or Tautaun Skull to add 5 or 6 to power by putting out of play of the lost pile a Womp Rat or Emperor Palpatine. Weapon Levitation might help also against R3 Qui-Gon with his nasty lightsaber.<br />
Another option is NOT to battle the opponents characters if they are at the Theed Palace Generator, but to STICK at the Generator Core, where your drains are 3 minimum. Drop everyone there, but no Vader (or Vader AND Palpatine). The amount of power should be too much for the opponent to deal with, so you can have quickly a drain of 3 there uncontested (not counting Presence Of The Force and Stormtrooper Garrison) while your opponent gets only a drain of 2. Add to the fact that you&#39;re draining also at Endor: Back Door and you have the game in hand.<br />
Vs. the famous racing/goo nee tay version of Combat, this DS Deck has still some chances to come out on top. The game will be decided at Malastare, so get the Judicator and Laser Cannon Battery into hand. This would definitively help taking out the space presence without too much problems. In this match-up, don&#39;t bother going to Naboo (unless the opponent spreads): just deploy to Endor in the beginning and get some cards to destroy the LS space presence. Once done, life will be easier. Do NOT deploy Lord Vader, but find Darth Vader (V) to put him on the Judicator. You might not be able to drain there, but you will definitively not worry about Battle Plan, prevent I Did It!, and all these harsh drains you might suffer. All in all, the problem in itself is not LS Combat, but Goo Nee Tay coupled with Malastare. Any other combat should have a run for his money with this DS deck.<br />
<br />
<u>MBO</u>: Hmmmh.. Never seen one in action (but mine). I don&#39;t think you can do anything to stop the LS from blowing up the Death Star, besides some lucky draw and battles there. Just take the damage, and out-damage them. Ground should be owned really easily (ehm, not against my version), and you have just to be able to own also a BG system for battling (thus retrieving force). This is a deck match-up that you can lose, but you have the cards to win it. <br />
<br />
<u>Profit</u>: well, obviously you don&#39;t put any aliens to the AC but Arica. This will keep busy the opponent for a while. Then try to get Han with some Womp Rats (it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult) while you just sit draining at Endor. Not a really hard match-up at all, thanks to your creatures. If the opponent stays indoor, you can drain outside and he won&#39;t damage you as much.<br />
<br />
<u>RST</u>: Ok, the Shield will let you not to take any damage if they play Racing. And for the bunker, well, you can TRY to block them, and I think you should. It won&#39;t be so easy, although. Just try to feel the game. The pity is that the Womp Rat cannot deploy to interior sites. Else it would have been VERY easy.<br />
<br />
<u>RTP</u>: This may seem difficult, but it is not too much, really. The Coward shield will stop any cheesy force drain, and you just need a Walker where to hide from any EPPs strikes. Ok, better 2 Walkers. Indeed, while unique vehicles lost from table go OOP, they do NOT lose any immunity and they still protect from weapon fire, so the Cadet can still absorb the attrition you will suffer, saving a looot of times your characters and vehicles while you kill theirs. With the Stormtrooper Garrison, you could even risk putting Vader outside (if Lord Vader). If the Stormtrooper Garrison dies, you can retrieve him, since he&#39;s a non-unique card (he doesn&#39;t go OOP).<br />
Less hard match-up than usual.<br />
