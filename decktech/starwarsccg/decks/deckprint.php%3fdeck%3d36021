We&#39;re In Attack Position Now   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here&#39;s my latest version of the deck, having gone 11-1 in tournament play so far (QMC Ellorrs twice, MWYHL IITFYS(V), Hyperdrive KDH(V), Non-Senate Podracing Mains, LSC, Profit, Senate, TIGIH, HB Corvettes, and 1-1 vs. D!CK HAT) and 3-0, 6 (+50) at OK States.  I fixed the problem of chasing around the LS space force (letting my opponent drain for free, which helped account for my one loss) by adding tractor beam stuff, which, given how quick and deadly SDs are when they cost 3 force each, leads to many game-ending beatdowns.  It&#39;s been my experience that being near-invincible in space is good enough to win most games, since most LS decks these days are mains-based and don&#39;t have much damage potential outside of battling and lightsaber drain bonuses (which usually get canceled by Imperial Decree anyway).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, as before, the key guy (most of the time) is Corporal Derdram (V).  I pull him with Commander Praji (V), who gets pulled by Endor Shield (V) and put aboard a SD 2nd turn.  Once Derdram is at the Bunker, Establish Secret Base (V) can be deployed (flipping the objective), Imperial Decree&#39;s &quot;one planet site&quot; portion is fulfilled, and Ominous Rumors adds +2 to a drain at a non-Endor system.  There are only a handful of ways to get to Derdram once he&#39;s in the Bunker, since Jar Jar and spies can&#39;t deploy there, and the LS can&#39;t move there (except from Back Door, which obviously we aren&#39;t stupid enough to provide), so he&#39;ll pretty much sit there all game.  Players that have seen the deck before typically throw Corran + a Jedi there ASAP to prevent my flip, but then they&#39;re stuck trying to protect a non-BG drain-of-1 site and lose the damage race anyway.  <br />
<br />
Commander Praji (V) also pulls most of the other pilots for whatever is needed, like cheaper deploy from Ozzel, Landing Claw canceling from Godherdt, +1 drains from Chiraneau, and force loss fodder from Barich/Elsek (since the flip side retrieves them, this is worth at least 5-10 force per game).<br />
<br />
Advantages: Very high drain potential from drain-2 locations+Admiral Chiraneau+Ominous Rumors; consistency/ease of play; both IDs reducing damage; good beatdown potential in space; high power means destiny canceling doesn&#39;t hurt much; easy to get immunity to attrition <6 vs. only one battle destiny; LS mains decks have no one to fight (except maybe Gen. Veers (V), or until late when I take over a site to clinch the game).<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: Only retrieval comes from the scouts and maybe Firepower (V), and neither ID completely stops damage, so cards do pile up in lost pile; Starships aren&#39;t searchable, so bad draws are possible; Not enough ground to repel Bunker-invaders, though I&#39;m still 5-0 in games that I don&#39;t get to flip; puts enough cards on table and doesn&#39;t retrieve enough to win by a lot (the most so far has been 19 or 21 I think).<br />
<br />
Matchups you want to see: QMC/AitC Ellorrs (V) (autowin), WHAP/Profit (start Imperial Decree (V), near autowin), Most other mains decks, HB that isn&#39;t CC/QLCs<br />
Matchups you don&#39;t want to see: RST, MBO, DBO (near autoloss when they use Menace Fades)<br />
Matchups that can go either way: WYS space, TIGIH, WYS Panic, LS Senate, HB CC/QLCs<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V) - Being able to, nearly without fail, deploy 2 SDs 2nd turn is huge, and also guarantees I have a safe place to put Praji (V) to pull Derdram (V).  <br />
<br />
Empire&#39;s New Order (V) - Some alien hate since I&#39;m not using any.   Also makes 6 of the characters deploy -1 and forfeit +1 (most of the time).<br />
<br />
Alter & Collateral Damage - I could use Premiere/Coruscant Alter, but I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d need to cancel any Utinni/Political effects, and the avg. destiny is low enough that I&#39;ve blind drawn to kill off one half of a Jedi duo at the DB.<br />
<br />
The rest are pretty self-explanatory I would think, the deck isn&#39;t exactly mind-wrenching.<br />
<br />
