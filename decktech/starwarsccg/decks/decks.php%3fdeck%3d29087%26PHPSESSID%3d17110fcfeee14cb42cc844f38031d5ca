First, I&#39;d like to thank everybody who evaluated this deck outside of the standard DT guidelines.  By definition, this deck has to be 3.5 or lower right of the bat because of the speeders matchup.  So to those of you who rated it based on how it was for what it is, I appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Some responses to feedback....<br />
<br />
Devastator/Chimaera vs. Death Squadron SD&#39;s?  True, with Lennox, the DSSD&#39;s are better than what I have in there.  However, I need Lennox to make them work.  If Lennox was an Admiral for Imp. Command or a Commander for Piett so I could pull him somehow, I&#39;d probably make the switch.  But no, Lennox&#39;s punk-azz couldn&#39;t get promoted beyond Craptain.  Having to draw into him is slow to have 3 of my 4 SDs need him.  The only reason Tyrant made it around this fact is that Tyrant can deploy for 7 on it&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
Crashed Vehicles and Unsalvageable?  I checked the PC Ruling Sheet, and it basically has a large portion of the old-skool Glossary text in it for "crashed".  While it does state that pilots aboard crashed vehicles are cool, it states "Because a crashed vehicle may not utilize game text, and Permanent Pilot aboard does not provide ability (or Presence)".  This would make it "unpiloted" for the purposes of Unsalvageable, which is useful for decks that are replacing TRM with LU for EPP platforms.  They tend to run the generic speeders instead of matching pilot speeders to satisfy the objective.  Of course, I don&#39;t have Crash Landing in there now, but it&#39;s one of those cards that sometimes creeps in.<br />
<br />
Too Cold for Speeders and other anti-speeder tech?  I skipped TCFS due to it&#39;s affect on my walkers.  If it didn&#39;t hit me too, it&#39;d be in there in a minute.  As for other anti-speeder tech, there&#39;s not much I could find that was worth the slots in an already tight deck.  I can&#39;t use P-59 or Dengar without killing Domination, and 1 or 2 Crash Landings doesn&#39;t really do enough to stop a determined speeder player.  If the PC makes any type of future anti-speeder card, you can be sure I&#39;ll try it out.<br />
<br />
WYS?  I know WYS is a tough matchup, but WYS is a tough matchup for lots of things.  But I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s the "auto-loss" that speeders can be.  It is tough, and you do have to play it carefully.  I&#39;ve tested against it to get a feel for the timing and issues involved, and have a pretty good handle on how to put myself in position to win.<br />
<br />
Krayt Dragon Bones/Bubo?  It seems fairly pointless.  The Bones are just in there to start against LU so I can pull One-Arm/Wampa Cave for some extra force.  Most good players won&#39;t lose this game just because a Wampa got in the War Room, so a second Wampa was pointless.  Hence the Bubo.  Granted, he can&#39;t go to Hoth, but he doesn&#39;t count against my deck limit and is Deploy-1/Power-6, so he&#39;s in there for scrub control.  In the right situation, he eats smugglers from WYS, maybe Han from Profit, or any other pointless annoying guys like K&#39;Fal, Harc Seff, Corporal Beezer, whatever.  And if he doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s not hurting much sitting under my shield.<br />
<br />
Admiral Piett?  Agreed, he is too expensive just to pull an AO.  I go back and forth all the time on changing him out.  But he does forfiet for 6, he can pull Praji or Igar if not the AO, and he does add three to power.  Does it make him worthwhile?  Maybe, maybe not.  I can tell you this, if Goo is out, Piett just goes straight into the Lost Pile for a drain, so I guess that answers my question.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and keep it coming!<br />
<br />
***END EDIT***<br />
<br />
<br />
O.K., right off the bat, this deck most likely loses to speeders.  Accidents happen and perhaps it could win, but it sure as heck isn&#39;t likely.  So if you&#39;re sitting there itching to hit 1-star and tell me "speederz will rule your azz", don&#39;t bother, I already know.  But that&#39;s not all that&#39;s wrong with this platform.  It&#39;s also really card intensive.  Not only do you start 11, but man, you need locations, you need ships, you need walkers, you need Imperials, plus essential Interrupts like Command and Garrison to go along with cards like AT-AT Cannon and one of those poopy Epic Events.  That doesn&#39;t leave you much room to meta or raise your average destiny.  What else sucks about this platform?  Ooh, you may not be able to play ZiMH or Super-Fett in it, I mean, you could, but it wouldn&#39;t make much sense.  It also sets up more slowly than a lot of other decks too.  So why play it?  Two reasons.  One, once set-up, it can deal some nasty, nasty damage.  And two, it&#39;s friggin&#39; fun.  It&#39;s also a good way to show off the Virtual Cards to a returning player, as it uses a whole lot of them.  As a bonus, it could also be a Classic deck simply by removing the Defensive Shields and switching Accelerate to Twi&#39;Lek, but well, I wouldn&#39;t take it to Classic due to the prevalance of LU/Speeders in that format.<br />
<br />
This is not an easy deck to play.  You constantly have to adapt to what you get in your hand, and what your opponent is forcing you to do.  I&#39;m assuming I don&#39;t need to say things like "Command for Piett, use him to pull the AO" in the strategy, as you guys already know this shyte.  But having Imperial Decree on the table from the beginning buys you a little time early, and Domination can help you hang on late due to the recirculating pilots.  This deck will not win by 40 cards, but it is also not easy to beat.<br />
<br />
So what do you do with it?  After you draw your opening hand, Imperial Command for Veers if you have one, then pull the 3rd Marker and a Garrison, then activate.  Now pull Blizzard 4 and make your first decision.  When you deploy Blizzard 4, pull the guy who&#39;s going to blow shyte up for you.  You should also pull the Executor Docking Bay.  If you&#39;re against a speed deck and need the MPG gone ASAP, pull Vader.  He&#39;s an auto-hit against the MPG, and you can take him back into hand with Come With Me for hit-and-runs later.  Against a slower deck (or if you&#39;ve played this 40-50 times like I have), Igar should be a good enough sniper, although he may miss the first time.  Second turn, pull the Walker to go with your pilot (Tempest 1 for Igar, Blizzard 1 for Veers or Vader), drop the 3rd Marker, and move over.  Two destiny with either Veers or Igar and some immunity is generally enough to keep the LS from coming at you on their second turn.  If you&#39;re against a deck that you think might come at you that fast, wait a turn, pull a second Walker, and march in together.  Third turn, pull the Cannon and deploy it to the Walker (weapons deploy normally under the Hoth shield), fourth turn pull the Epic Event.  If at any point you draw into any of the cards to be pulled, simply use the Control Phase ability to take an extra walker into hand for later.  Blow up the MPG to make them lose 8, make them lose another couple to YMSYL, and now worry about reinforcing the Hoth system.<br />
<br />
If Honor is out, it&#39;s best to get yourself set up at the 3rd Marker, the Hoth system, and the Hoth DB before playing Garrison, but if not, go ahead and play it sooner and drain for two at the Ice Plains and the 1st Marker.  Ideally, you&#39;re going to Garrison to drain 3 at the DB, 4 at the 3rd Marker, 2 at the Ice Plains, 4 at Hoth (with Chiraneau), then hit them for 2 from YMSYL, and 2 from the Admiral&#39;s Order.  If you managed to get the fourth walker to the first marker (infrequent, and a low priority), it&#39;s an additional drain of 2, plus another force to YMSYL.  No matter how you look at it, that&#39;s a brutal turn for any deck to absorb, even moreso if you tack Limited Resources on top of it when they throw most of their hand away to the drains.  Once you get everything how you want it, the deck is just an avalanche of damage coming at them, keeping them from beating you if they couldn&#39;t get you early.  If they spread to try to match your drains, you EPP Vader them, then initiate with the other Vader and retrieve the first one via Domination, lather, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s some match-ups:<br />
<br />
Speeders: You lose.  Seriously though, start Krayt Dragon Bones, pull One-Arm first turn, pull the Wampa Cave, then move him into the War Room.  This will not be at all devastating to most Speeder decks, but it is inconvenient if they are counting on Romas to lower the shields, and you need the extra force.  From there, just do what you can to keep from getting destroyed too quickly.  Fight to keep their diff low, and if you can find a way to sneak it out, great.  But the truth is, they have 45347 ways to pull cards, and you have, well, um, Come With Me.<br />
<br />
TRM: They are waiting for you to do something, so they can spring an attack on you.  But TRM relies on EPPs, and sabers don&#39;t work on guys in Walkers.  Personally, I just keep pulling Walkers and putting them at the 5th Marker, then moving all in one clump they don&#39;t want to mess with, then spreading out once the Direct Damage begins to hurt them a little.  It really slows the game down, but negates their inherent advantage from you supplying them with the Hoth Shield.  I&#39;ve won this match-up, but it&#39;s a very conservative style you have to play with it.<br />
<br />
Senate: I haven&#39;t had to play Senate yet, and I refuse to ever build a Senate deck, even for playtesting purposes.  I&#39;d imagine it plays out very similar to TRM since they are planning on playing reactive, but I would think you could move a little more quickly against Senate.  Wait, I&#39;m lying.  I did play against a Senate deck once, but it was a casual game with a young player and I slapped him silly, so that shouldn&#39;t count.<br />
<br />
WYS: If they want to pull Kessel early and give you two force, great.  They probably won&#39;t, figuring that fighting you at Hoth instead gives them a better chance of pulling off Menace Fades.  Hoth get&#39;s really bloody, but you can re-circulate your pilots with Domination and Come With Me (or Praji) almost as easily as they can with Bacta Tank.  Command is great but will get grabbed, but it should allow your much higher power (since Dash won&#39;t work) to make them forfiet more than one guy from the early battles.  Unsalvageable is also your friend here.  As for the ground, this is why the Bubo is in the deck instead of another Wampa.  If they do something silly like leave Lando and Talon Karde in the Cantina, while sending everybody else to Hoth, you drop Bubo, drop Vader, eat one, and stick the other one in the butt with your lightsaber.<br />
<br />
Combat: You&#39;re not trying to drain with Jedi, and any lightsaber bonuses are negated by Decree.  Even if they do some Obi-Wan&#39;s Journal crap, you&#39;re still not taking the hit too badly.  This is one of those match-ups where you might want to consider using Vader to blow away the MPG early, but only if you have Come With Me (or Accelerate to go get it) so you can get him back off the table right away.<br />
<br />
QMC: This deck hasn&#39;t given me much trouble.  Maybe there&#39;s a speed version out there that would get to me early, but the ones I&#39;ve seen, I pretty much ignore.  They can&#39;t drain me the way I can drain them, so I just ignore them while we both set-up, give them the one or two brutal drain turns, then EPP Vader a couple times to retrieve Imperials I threw out to force drains.<br />
<br />
Everything else: You have to adapt to what you&#39;re dealt.  Try to stick to your strategy as close as you can, even if it means getting drained here and there early on.  Imperial Decree will keep you from falling too far behind, and once you pull of those Garrisons, the game rapidly swings back to your favor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
IAO instead of IAO/Secret Plans?  That extra 1 forfiet to your jabronis is just too big.  Most LS players are used to Secret Plans and work around it anyway, and if you really have to, pull the Shield.  Being able to sack one guy for 6 or 7 and then retrieve him with Domination to be pulled via Praji or CWM for re-use is just too good.<br />
<br />
Captain Lennox?  You won&#39;t always care about the ability and power bonus to the Tyrant, he&#39;s in there for two main reasons.  One, he&#39;s forfiet 7 which means if nothing else, he&#39;s a second Evax.  Two, if him and Ozzel (or Piett) are chilling out at the Hoth system while Death Squadron is out, deploying a Walker means Tyrant comes from Reserve for free via PfaSA.  Free Star Destroyers are good.<br />
<br />
Lieutenant Cabbel?  Think about the biggest knock on Blizzard 1/Veers.  A destiny draw of 6 or 7 kicks them off the table.  Put Cabbel in Blizzard 1 with Veers, and not only does he add 2 to power, he makes that seven stacked on Colo a 6, and then forfiets for 6.  He&#39;s Veers&#39;s freaky love-slave.<br />
<br />
Commander Praji?  I know he doesn&#39;t forfiet for much, but he pulls pilots into hand as opposed to playing them on table like CWM.  Pull a pilot, chuck him to a drain, retrieve with Domination, pull him again.  It&#39;s fun.  Plus he could technically trigger the AO at a Hoth site, but that&#39;s unlikely.<br />
<br />
Why those Star Destroyers?  I wanted value, since this deck uses a lot of force.  Devastator and Chimaera are ability 2, ICSD-v draws destiny alone, and Tyrant can come down free (see Lennox).  Everything else was just infeasible for the deck.<br />
<br />
Why only 4 Walkers?  Because I hate those other ability-1 or "no pilot" walkers.  They&#39;re crap.  Truth is, the Ice Plains is a fairly safe staging area, so unless you play carelessly, your walkers should be able to stick around for a while.  You need 4 so you can still Garrison if you lose one, but you don&#39;t need a fifth when it would either be a duplicate or a crap-walker any way...<br />
<br />
Blizzard Scout 1? This was originally another jabroni Imperial, but BS1 is destiny 4, ability 2, reacts to battles, and can cancel the added destiny from Psycho-Lando.  That&#39;s good enough for me.<br />
<br />
Breached Defenses?  I&#39;m not *that* worried about maintanence cards, but this one is useful.  I can pull it via Accelerate or Fanfare (or one of the V#5 imperials if I change a guy), but it also helps at Hoth.  A lot of LS decks use HCiF as their "space package", so if they decide to try to go to Hoth early to cause some force loss, I slap this on them.  Not only does it make them lose 1 a turn, but it also makes them sweat wondering how long before I come down and kick their Power 6, 1 destiny-drawing azz with some SD&#39;s.  I&#39;ve actually had people place them out of play from an empty Hoth system after a turn or two, just because of this card.<br />
<br />
Furry Fury?  We all know why this is good, but combine it with Breached Defenses, then point and laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you really want to try to win the speeder match-up, you could add things like Crash Landing to follow-up with Trample or Unsalvageable (remember crashing cancels gametext like permanent pilots), but remember Nightfall/Too Cold hurts your Walkers as well.  My personal choice was to concede that Speeders is a bad matchup for me, and not dilute the deck against other LS strategies.  It&#39;s your call.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything else should be pretty self-explanatory, but feel free to either D-Mail or ask questions in your reviews.  Like I said, it has that horrible match-up against speeders, but beyond that, it&#39;s a solid deck and a lot of fun...  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font class="bfont"> <a href="/starwarsccg/decks/decks.php?PHPSESSID=17110fcfeee14cb42cc844f38031d5ca">Back to Decks Directory</a> | <A HREF="/starwarsccg/decks/decks.php?reviews=29087&PHPSESSID=17110fcfeee14cb42cc844f38031d5ca"> Read Reviews </A> | <a href="deckprint.php?deck=29087&PHPSESSID=17110fcfeee14cb42cc844f38031d5ca" TARGET="BLANK_"> Printer Friendly</a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="review"></a><font class="h2font">In order to review decks you must be a registered member. <A href="/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=17110fcfeee14cb42cc844f38031d5ca">Sign up for free!</A></font></td></tr></table>
