<br />
"Hidden Base - The Evolution of a "Broken" Objective" <br />
<br />
That article is currently in the Top 10 list or Top 5 list depending on how you like to look at it. <br />
<br />
This deck is part of the evolution of the Hidden Base objective. <br />
<br />
When reviewing this deck please remember that the year is 2001 and I just got through beating Douglas Harvilla in the final confrontation and that the deck was 4-0 on the day. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t own a computer at the time and I never got the chance to submit it then, but better late than never hopefully. <br />
<br />
Depending on how well this deck is received, I plan on posting all of my old decks from over the years in hopes of helping current players see how decks have evolved over the years. <br />
<br />
Seeing as how old this deck is now, I am going to refrain from posting an outdated match-up section unless it is important to you (in which case please dmail me before reviewing, if it will affect my score so I can edit it in, thanks). <br />
<br />
I will go over a few of the card choices to point out neat tricks however. <br />
<br />
Here Goes: <br />
<br />
(Aim High) - Was very important in many match-up&#39;s. <br />
<br />
It won me countless games when I tracked high destiny&#39;s (usually 5&#39;s) combined with 2 Characters (except Luke or Obi) and fired my weapons twice hitting up to 2 of their Characters and getting + 5 power along with tracked 5&#39;s for battle destiny. <br />
<br />
For example in one of my games I dropped EPP Han and Leia on a lone Mighty Jabba. <br />
<br />
I shot him twice hitting him both times (perfectly legal). <br />
<br />
I then had 12 power plus a battle destiny total of 10 (Han adds one, I&#39;ve heard that phrase at least 100 times mostly from my own voice lol, 22 power with 2 Characters). <br />
<br />
He drew a 4 and had to lose 15 overflow. <br />
<br />
Killer, absoulutely killer. Then I lost Leia so I could drain on the ground, but I was sure to land an X-Wing at Han&#39;s site so I&#39;d have forfeit fodder and a battle destiny if he tried to beat me down with Mara next turn. <br />
<br />
Then when he didn&#39;t I drained, deployed LSJK to Han&#39;s site, the X-Wing took off again and I had 10 power plus another battle destiny total of 10 (with 2 destiny&#39;s, EPP Han adds one with either Character) in case I would&#39;ve been challenged on the ground it would&#39;ve defended quite well. <br />
<br />
Now that we have covered the old trick for clearing a site let&#39;s move on... <br />
<br />
(Order To Engage) - With 2 Rebel Barriers and 2 Hyper Escapes this card was also killer (it no longer is due to shields). <br />
<br />
The main idea behind this deck is still the same as it is nowadays. Drain for as much as you can, as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
With this old version of the deck if they spread out with 2 ships and one of the ships were alone, you could wait utill one of their ships battled you, then just Hyper Escape to the system where their ship was alone and they lost force to Order To Engage. <br />
<br />
If they only have one ship, Barrier and then same as above. <br />
<br />
There&#39;s also an X-Wing cannon in here along with Home 1 (since you would typically have a lot of extra force and you wouldn&#39;t always want to draw a bunch of cards if they are playing HD with Monnok). <br />
<br />
A good number of people still played a decent number of capitial ships, so Home 1 was the good call in place of a second X-Wing Laser Cannon, Spiral or Houjix combo in that meta. <br />
<br />
(All Wings Report In) - Helped you track those 5&#39;s and set up the ships faster. <br />
<br />
That isn&#39;t the main reason it&#39;s worth mentioning though of course. <br />
<br />
You would retrieve 12 to 15 force one per game, each game. <br />
<br />
Now that was the most killer of them all! <br />
<br />
I hope that this is worth reading and reviewing. If you have any qustions before reviewing this deck about old card choices or specific match-ups that would better help you understand why this deck was able to perform so well, please ask before you even consider deducting anything from the score. I took a lot of pride in building and playing this deck, so your review means a lot to me. <br />

"I just had a beer, so this might come out wrong: I&#39;ll cut your throat. Oh yeah, and this deck sucks now." <br />

<br />
If you even tried to come near me with a statement like that and a weapon I&#39;d blow your frimbazeling head off with what is known as a registered hand gun. But as far as how good the deck is now? Who cares? Did you even read the description or this stategy section? What about how good IT WAS? It&#39;s a popularity contest with you Brandon as always. Let me know when you lose your title this year so you can be taken down a notch, grow up and act normal. <br />

I probably had this one coming so it&#39;s a distant second. I recently reviewed one of his TR&#39;s and said the same thing. But Spencer, just remember that I owe you one now ;) <br />
That is unless you give me a good reason not to =0 <br />

"needs power pivot rebel fleet x2, and uh... the FOREST and coruscant system sux0r" <br />
<br />
My Response: <br />
<br />
Well it looks like you gave me a review that tried to be somewhat constructive (aside from just trying to get your deck higher on the top 10 list than this one ;). However, if you would&#39;ve dmailed me I could&#39;ve explained why you&#39;re wrong. The Coruscant system was good for distracting them from probing my HB. The Forest would&#39;ve been an awful call, that&#39;s definetly the worst idea I could&#39;ve used. There was WAY too much No Escape starts with HD and plenty of Elis Helrot. There isn&#39;t room for a 2nd Rebel Fleet. If I would&#39;ve wanted Power Pivot in here I would&#39;ve wanted at least 2 X-Wing Laser Cannons. I would&#39;ve taken out Home 1 and put in the second Cannon. Then there wouldn&#39;t have been room for the Power Pivot... <br />

"what the hell are you posting 4 year old decks for" <br />

If you read the strategy section before submitting a review you might be able to figure it out... <br />

"In the glossary supplement landed starships cannot use ability to draw battle destiny."" <br />

My Response: <br />

While your review was very much appreciated because of the high score it was not the current ruling at the time. Back in 2001 I was very aware of all of the rules and made sure I checked them all thoroughly. I made sure to be up to date on how Doug Taylor was going to rule on key plays based on the current CRD (which overrides all previous rulings up to that point as I&#39;m sure you know). My landed starships at the Docking Bay&#39;s had no power, but still added their ability toward drawing battle destiny&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t for 7 months after 2001 States that they changed it to that in the CRD. Thanks for the score =)<br />

His review:<br />
<br />
1 stars - Yet biological reasoning would have me believe otherwise. Twas in the past, yet although unknown being are rather rare on this side of the moon its safe to say they are dangerously unknown in these parts, commencing all but the last of earthlings. Condesending to the least they provide a rather humanly take on chemical diversity. This seems to be the overly supported theory on migrational trends in these parts. Northern parts of eastern Africa are well know for this, but scientists rarely admit to the fallacies that go along with these birds. With a fairly abnormal talon ratio, these birds are threatning the very life of aquatic life in many parts of the Mediteranean Sea and the Indian Ocean.<br />

<br />
Sir, thank you very much for the review. I couldn&#39;t have been convinced to spend 250 tech points in a better manner. I&#39;m sure you will find my reviews on your decks equally constructive.  <br />

Thanks for the reviews guys, I appreciate all the support in reviewing such an old deck. My next LS that I won 2003 WA States with wasn&#39;t HBX, lol.
