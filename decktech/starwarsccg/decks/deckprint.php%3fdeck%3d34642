It is truly one of the funniest decks I have ever played. The idea is to get a Rebel at the beginning, give him/her to either 4-Lom or IG-88 move over to the Chamber, and by third turn, the character is frozen, causing a lose of 8 force. Then you transfer to Boba Fett (V) and put Bounties on him so you NEVER have to pay to retrieve the whole game.<br />
<br />
Besides All Wrapped Up (V), there are 4 other ways to capture characters: 2 Hidden Weapons, Fett’s Gun (V), IG-88 with Gun, and Snoova with Axe. <br />
The lightside will never know what hit them. <br />
<br />
Ok here is how you play it.<br />
First do you normal free Executor, if they don’t give you Lando, get Lando out on the Executor to not only take him away from the Lightside, but his text will be used ALL game to Freeze and Capture. Next you want to “start the freezing process” you want either IG or 4-Lom to ALWAYS take the captive over to the chamber. All of this should be first turn if you put one of them in your opening hand. <br />
<br />
Next get out Carbon Freezing on the site to target the Rebel. You can use Prepare the Chamber to add 2, HAYBH (V) also adds two, plus the site and Console add 5, so before you even draw, you could have 9, plus Lando gives another 1 for 10. Well guess what you have to draw to freeze, 11. So you only need a one in order to freeze. BAM, they lose 8 just like walkers and usually by second turn. <br />
<br />
From there, you want to have deployed the CC: Docking Bay on the other side of the Tower so you can complete a Bounty on the way over. If you can get both droids out, you want to put the Terminal Detonator on the one who will be doing the Bounty to add 3 to the retrieval. Then when you are ready to march on over to the Audience Chamber, the other droid will take him out and begin the hike.<br />
<br />
The important thing to remember is that you want them to come down after you to stop the freezing, that is what the other guys are in there for. Whoever comes to the ground, you capture and take the jail. You can then freeze another character when you are ready. The key is taking all of their characters away and then retrieving any lost cards from drains or lost battles. <br />
<br />
With Lando out, you will either capture or make lost every single time with Hidden Weapons. So in a game you could get Jodo and Fett out to capture, Snoova could have someone, IG could have someone, and any forfeited characters also get captured. <br />
<br />
It would take a really good player to win with this deck at a tournament, but most of the time, the lightside is not going to be able to fight off that many ways to capture. This deck works A LOT like most light decks, doing its own thing and just retrieving any lost force. This is very much a reacting deck, you want to go after them EARLY with Maul and Vader, never want a lot of guys on the ground form a force. Battle, battle, battle and you will win. <br />
Just something to think about. <br />
<br />
Card chooses<br />
<br />
Boba Fett (V) CC  - Well, you can either put him in space or Bounty with him. Its great to Freeze during control, Deploy a Bounty durning deploy phase, then play HAYBH (V) to transfer from the droid and move over to retrieve for FREE. If they come down, you can Hidden Weapons. <br />
<br />
Maul & Vader with Fun toys – these are in here to cause characters to be lost from the table to be captured by the bounty hunters. With three bounties they are always coming back into the deck for continuing strike missions the whole game.<br />
<br />
Oh, Switch Off – protect the droids from Sorry about the Mess and Jar Jar<br />
<br />
Emergency Deployment (V) - weapon finder for darkside, for Fett’s Gun or the Detonator. <br />
<br />
Krayt Dragon Bones (V) – I search for too much to play with Drop (V), plus the Bubos are to help protect Audience Chamber. Killing Machines in this deck, they go out for an attach die get retrieved and the go out for more.<br />
<br />
Imperial Artillery – two 7s in the deck, with the two non lightsaber weapons, great for the fish<br />
<br />
Barriers over AAA x3 – don’t want to get a character killed off when I am not ready, the retrieval gets the characters back, plus there are too many permanent weapon characters to make it worthwhile <br />
<br />
<br />
I know this deck has its weaknesses, the point is to play it for FUN first then if you like the idea, you can change it to be a better tournament deck. <br />
Any suggestions would be welcome, Good Luck<br />
