<br />
To account for my reviews: I completely understand that dueling off the Jedi (Obi & Luke) will shut down what I am trying to do with this deck, but I was trying to make it clear that this is a great deck for a large tournament not necessary every single local tournament, because there will always be that guy who builds deck that can just tech you. But, when you are trying to play a deck that can be a good strategy to what you might see over all at a large major tournament, this one is AWESOME. <br />
<br />
Dueling Huntdown is a deck that Hurts my deck, but I can still win against it. I will already have the advantage in space, and I dont have to worry as much about Qui-Gon getting duels but a Huntdown that packs dueling for both Darths takes up a lot of card slots. When you build a deck that must have so many slots just to kill three characters, it is not going to be a good deck to always play. I built a dueling huntdown myself and quit playing it because it lost to Hidden Base, Speeders, Every Kind of Agents, WHAP, and Senate. The deck just cant defend against decks that can win without coming to where you are. All of those decks are popular and I am sure you will see all of them at a large tournament, so why would you even think about playing a deck like Huntdown that is going be an auto loss. <br />
<br />
SO, to fix this problem, put in one Lost in the Wilderness and one What Was It? in the deck. The LITW I used to put Darth Maul missing, in fact, every single game I have ever played that card against when the person was playing Huntdown, I put one of the major Jedi missing. So think about that when you are wanting to play this deck and you are worried about Huntdown. In fact, Jedi Luke got crossed over, and I still won that game by a good margin. The What Was It? Is tech for the surprise duel, it can be found with your shield and protects Qui-Gon or Luke against this deck type. Easy fix <br />
<br />
Take out Escape Pod (V), and put in Lost in the Wilderness <br />
Take out one Its a Trap, put in one What Was It? <br />

As far as that tech with the You are Beaten and Sniper Combo. I already said that you can Sense it, but yes lets say that Huntdown is REALLY big in your area, so it will be hard to Sense those cards. If you fear this happening at your tournament Twik the deck and put in Twilight is Upon Me, and one or two A Jedis Concentration. In a way, this card should probably go in here anyway, because Darth Maul with Stick can be annoying. There was a Klor Slug (V) in here too before to protect against Emperor (V) and Dr E, may need to go back in. So, if you want to play this in a local tournament that does have a specific meta, just Twik the deck. You know what your friends like to play, so fix it. That is what a good deck does, all it takes is one or two card differences to change the out come. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said in the beginning intro, this is a new version of my old Super Profit Beatdown that I used to play way back in 2000. I believe this to be equally as strong if not more versatile, only not as perfect because there is no lock on the Force you used to be able to get with Frozen Assets back before they made that darn Shield that just cancels it. <br />
<br />
To look at this deck from the start, you might think I just built another Tosche Station deck and change some of the Interrupts, which I guess is true but you might see how this deck works differently. To tell you the truth, the idea of this deck is VERY easy to play. If a new player has most of the cards, but just doesn&#39;t have the Jedi Lukes, Master Luke or even Scout Jedi Luke could work, but regular Jedi Knight is of course better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Starting <br />
<br />
Your starting effects are pretty standard except for the fourth one, which is one reason why this deck is SO much more all around powerful. You always want to start Rycar (V), Sal&#39;Tor (V), and Encampment (V). You can put in the fourth spot anyone of three different choses: The Camp, Scrambled Transmission (V), or Draw Their Fire. This will all depend on the match you might be up against, so I will go over that later in this strategy. <br />
<br />
The start of this deck begins much like other Tosche Station decks. . During your opponents first turn, you want to pull one of the three cards; Bionic Hand (V), Mercenary Armor, or Lightsaber Proficiency from Rycar (V), so as not to give them an extra card with Thrown Back (V). The most important are Bionic Hand and the Armor because they both add power to the character you put them on and the Armor is very important to get around Imperial Barrier. Now, if your opponent starts Ability, Ability, Ability (V), then pull the Proficiency. The only reason the Armor is even in there is because of Barriers. Although, it would be great to get the Armor on Luke when you Beatdown, you probably want to put it on Corran Horn with Qui-Gon, so they can&#39;t Barrier Luke in the battle. <br />
<br />
Next, you would have started by putting Encampment (V) on the Outskirts, so, now you pull Qui-Gon (Not Luke) which is different from normal Tosche Station starts, then give him his stick with Sal&#39;Tor (V). Finally, moving him over to the Station. You want to get C-3P0 there with him also, basically you want to get the activation from the site but save Luke for the Super Beatdown, which because of the (V) cards you will see has become even more jaw dropping. After that you just use 3P0&#39;s text to create the proper set up for you hand to deal out a beatdown somewhere on the table. <br />
<br />
The reason I don&#39;t have Civil Disorder (V) in this deck is because you must be able to play your Barriers, the key to this deck working well, is getting a character or two stuck trying to fight Qui-Gon. You, can also play It&#39;s a Trap to keep them from killing Qui-Gon as well. Once they have committed to the ground. Either at Qui-Gon&#39;s site or somewhere else, doesn&#39;t matter as long as you have confidence that when you deploy to that site there will be no problems with Luke and a Jedi battling (Qui-Gon or Obi-Wan). That means you don&#39;t deploy to a site where you think one of them could get captured or excluded before the battle has any result. The idea is you will be deploying Luke, a Jedi, and (if needed) anyone else i.e. Chewie, Han, or even Lando. <br />
<br />
So lets take an example of an average battle, lets say they put out Darth Maul with Stick to battle the lone Qui-Gon, you play It&#39;s a Trap. Now, on your turn, you put out Luke for 8, putting one of his lightsabers on him, the Bionic hand, and the Proficiency, all of which can be pulled with this deck. He is always power 6, 8 with saber, 11 with Proficiency, 13 with the Hand, (lets also put the Armor on him just to see the highest possible) for 2 more. That comes to a grand total of 16 power just for little small Luke, next you want to play Courage of a Skywalker on Luke to add his ability to his power making the 16 a 22. Now, lets just say you also had enough force to play Chewie, Engraged. He is power 9. Next you play Jedi Presence on Qui-Gon making Luke 44 and Chewie 18, that makes a total for just those three characters, before any destiny has been drawn (44 + 18 + 6) lets see carry the one and all that oh yeah................................. 68!!!!!!!! AUTO WIN, End of Game at that very moment, no matter what has happen, nothing, IT&#39;S OVER. <br />
<br />
The look, you will see, the look on peoples faces when it happens. Just one battle and the game ends right then and there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Can you see how this deck works. Now, I know you are sitting there thinking, well, I can just Ghhk that, and you are right, you can, but that is the chance you take. This idea has been out for YEARS, and until the shield, I just put out Frozen Assets on their Force Pile and with Draw their Fire, they couldn&#39;t play Ghhk, so I always won. I put this deck back together because the average dark deck plays with one Ghhk and one Masterful Move combo, When they put out the strongest character in the game verses just one character, no darkside player is thinking about having to use it now, so it is not going to be priority to have the Ghhk in their hand. The deck doesn&#39;t have to win the game with this one battle, it has enough space, and ground power to win on its own. Having this ability just gives the deck another way to AUTO win if the time is right for the beating. It can happen late game, when the Ghhk was lost to a Force drain because there was no clear sign that it was going to be used. <br />
<br />
<br />
Let me now, break down why this deck is still solid with the cards that are in it, as well as go over the match ups. So you will have no doubt in your mind that this deck will be one to fear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Card Breakdown: <br />
<br />
<br />
Frozen Assets - Please, this card is awesome in this deck. Yes, they can just cancel it with a Shield, but man you just lost one card that is a 5 destiny for them to use a Shield spot. Plus, if its late game and they have used all their shields, it is like an auto win, combined with this nexted card. <br />
<br />
Draw Their Fire - because it helps to keep them from playing Ghhk, if they don&#39;t have the force, then you have the win, best to save it and deploy it when you are battling. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s a Trap - Protects Qui-Gon, and there is only one card that cancels it and it can be Sensed. <br />
<br />
Sense/Recoil in Fear - There is one of this version because sometimes you hand is just plan crap or your opponents is really great because he keeps telling you so, the look on their face alone is worth playing it. <br />
<br />
Wedge - Pilot for space decks, with Corran Horn cancels destiny, and makes for a cheap character to add to the beatdown battle <br />
<br />
Home One - a must in Tosche Station, with all that force so early in the game, you have to put the lightside mothership in <br />
<br />
Tawss Khaa (V)- another reason for the darkside to have to come and fight Qui-Gon, if you are draining for 2 or 3 and there is NOTHING they can do about it, they will be coming to kill him. <br />
<br />
Control/ Tunnel Vision Combo - a must for finding all of the cards you need at the right time, also lets you see what is in all of that force <br />
<br />
Clash of Sabers - takes out the power of forfeit of a character at a site, another card that can be used to help beatdown <br />
<br />
Boushh - there probably should be more versions of Leia in this deck, but I find that I always end up getting Boushh out anyway, so why play with any other. <br />
<br />
We&#39;re you Looking for me - a 5 that goes back, and like playing two C-3P0s <br />
<br />
We Wish to Board at Once - another 5 that goes back for free and a way to get the effect you need, like Draw their Fire <br />
<br />
The Camp - Tech against alien decks, imagine having to pay +4 for a Rodian to deploy to Qui-Gon&#39;s site, also awesome with Goo Nee Tay, making all of their deploy a problem on Tatooine. <br />
<br />
Scrambled Transmission (V) - I HATE SENATE, and it pulls Logistical Delay (V) <br />
<br />
Logistical Delay (V) - SUPER space tech, with this deck you are activating like a mad man, so why not use that force to just take away ALL immunity for darkside space. Sorry Executor but you got to die. <br />
<br />
Anakin&#39;s & Luke&#39;s Lightsabers - I play with both because I just want the lightsaber for Luke to add +2 to power and to have the swing. If I get Luke&#39;s in my hand, Boushh gets the other one. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you are beginning to see what this deck can mean for the game, imagine having to fear if the lightside is going to kick the crap out of you at any time if you have anybody on the ground. <br />
<br />
<br />
I will show you how it can win with all of the Match-ups broken down. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bring Him Before Me - I put this one first because you are already thinking that I can&#39;t beatdown with Luke against this deck, and yes you are right. So you either have to save Luke for the right time, or just battle with the other characters, I mean I can still play Courage on Boushh, that matched with Chewie can still be very powerful. The thing about playing against this deck is that they HAVE TO battle, or they are just losing force from their objective. Play smart, and should never lose. <br />
<br />
Tuskan Drain / Maul Deck - can be very hard to beat with how fast it sets up, but you will still be able to kill the crap out of them in battles. It doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t swing or drain good destinies with this deck. Pure power just kicks the crap out of you. Plus, they are pretty weak in space. Battle, Battle, Battle, and you will have the win. <br />
<br />
SYCFA Fear & Weather Vane (Walkway Start) - both of these decks are the only two where the darkside doesn&#39;t have to come to the ground and can just stay in space. It is important to just get Luke out to Tosche Station. You always start Scambled Transmission (V) to pull Logis Delay (V) so they will always lose something from battle. All characters go to space but the Jedi and Luke. Set up drains on the ground and if they go to the ground set up a Nabrun to beatdown. This can be a good game, but you have the advantage, Surprise. <br />
<br />
Senate - I say again, I HATE SENATE. So, start Srambled to just kill their objective. The Effect start alone will give you a big advantage. Senate decks don&#39;t have a lot of either space or ground because of all the Senators. SO, just wait for the time when they come after Qui-Gon, and they always do, then Beatdown. The Effect start alone will give you a big advantage. <br />
<br />
Black Sun & Scum Alien Decks - This is a great time to start The Camp. Man, just think, if you can get out Goo Nee Tay. It will cost them 9 force to deploy Broken Fett to Qui-Gon&#39;s site, then 2 more for up kept. This would be a good time to give Qui-Gon the Proficiency, so you will really make them want to try and built a force to stop you. You probably wouldn&#39;t even have to beatdown, just put both Jedi at either site and drain, put Tawss Khaa at Luke&#39;s site and if they come after him and you have to, then deploy Obi for few high power battles to knock them back off. Deploy problems alone will give you the victory here. <br />
<br />
Huntdown & Combact - Now, to tell you the truth, if you are chosing to take either of these to a tournament, you are probably going to lose. It is just not smart to play an objective that two specific deck types can destroy it, Hidden Base & Agents in the Court. So, you have the advantage that most people will not be playing this. But to tell you the truth, they have the best shot, because they can just kill my Jedi without even battling. You can still set up in space and completely knock them out. Just be careful when deploying to the ground, and if the timing is right, you can set up a beatdown, if you are sure that Luke will not be Dueled off. You are playing with 2 Courages. Truly the hardest match up for this deck, but has the ability to win. <br />
<br />
CCT - I saved this for last because of that stupid card called Imperial Justice. The good thing is this deck always gives up force, they can&#39;t help it, so since Luke & Obi only cost 13, just make sure you wait and deploy them when you can Alter the Bad Feeling Have I. The ability to beatdown will come in the most with this deck because they don&#39;t have to come to the growed, but the price of always having to pay for drains will force them down, and that is will you kill them, just what this deck does. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I have said enough. I know that wasn&#39;t every single deck type, but I covered the main ones and most other decks are types just like theses. Either space or ground. So, please if you rate this deck, make sure you take into account everything in this strategy section to see if your reason is truly not covered. <br />
<br />
Cheers. <br />
