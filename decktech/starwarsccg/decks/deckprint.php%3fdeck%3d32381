Also analiates ground without using many cards.<br />
<br />
Combos:<br />
Masterful Move- pulls Ghhhk and The Phantom Menace which keeps maul immune to attrition when he attacks the LSC jedi.  Also cancles cards.<br />
<br />
Dark Jedi Presence:  Lots of jedi, and lots of imperials, it is a given.<br />
<br />
Short Range Fighters and Dark Maneuvers-  Major battle destiny draws without drawbacks of lightside subrtacting of your destiny.<br />
<br />
Dark Maneuvers combo - Tallon roll the Black 2 or the Obsidian 1<br />
Black 2: 12+destiny<br />
Obsidian 1: 13+destiny<br />
<br />
Force Lightning + Emperor (V):  basically +5+destiny make people lost.  Also helps agains undercover spies.<br />
<br />
All Too Easy - 8 force lost when obj is flipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MatchUps:<br />
<br />
All:  Own in space (unless Hidden Base) and control your system and theirs.<br />
Drain race on ground, Fett Hunter vader or tarkin.  Use Maul and Dr. E to wreck havoc on ground.  Hold your sites with Emperor (V) and force lightning.<br />
<br />
Specific:<br />
<br />
Hidden Base:  Control Space and probe with Maul&#39;s ship until you get their system.  Cause beatdowns with your ships on theirs.  Don&#39;t worry about dark deal, if you want start draining but I think it is funner  (and more beneficial) to go and probe the systems first before set up dark deal.<br />
<br />
LSC:  Hard, bombard them with jedi.  Keep Emperor at site adn force lightning their jedi.  (+5+destiny more than defense value).  There will be a problem holding your cloud city sites so keep attacking them at naboo and drain at system.<br />
<br />
Profit:  Go after han w/maul and dr E.  Don&#39;t worry about space much.  Maul, dr e and xizor owns because after loosing 3 characters they won&#39;t have more than 6 ability most likely.<br />
<br />
TRM:  Take space early adn drain.  Hold on to space and save force.  Lay many characters down (pefereably Emperor (V) adn lando (V) adn guy w/saber) at carbonite chamber (which should be middle site).  Do this all at once, otherwise they will beat you down.  Put maul w/double saber at the chasam walkway all by himself, he will either go the the vane or take two of their characters out of battle and then hopefully clear the site.  For once, a deal that can hold its own against TRM.<br />
<br />
Not much else is played in this area (only some variations of TRM which play agianst them as if they were TRM.)<br />
<br />
Can&#39;t think of much else.<br />
Any helpful suggestions are greatly appreciated. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
