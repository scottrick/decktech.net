A quick response to review suggesting IAO in place of LLL(V): I tried playing Hunt Down with IAO and docking bays, and found that I couldn&#39;t force drain high enough at the DBs to convince some folks to "pay attention" to Hunt Down... they just ignored it and went about their setup.  My motivation for LLL(V) and the Naboo battlegrounds is to get higher drains early on, forcing disruption of other decks.  I will grant you that IAO is free... what do other people think?<br />
------------------------<br />
Like I mentioned, this is a new deck for me and my first Dark Side posting so forgive me if strategy section is less than thorough.  The basic gist of it is this:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
First Turn: If you get enough Force from your opponent, pull the 2/2 generator site and drop Vader.  If you have Blizzard 4 and no Vader, pull the Battle Plains and drop Blizzard 4, grabbing Vader w/the walker&#39;s text.  I choose the 2/2 Generator site because Vader is power +2 and if you lose it, you only get drained for 1.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
If you get little or no Force from the opponent, still pull a site.  I&#39;d go with the 3/2 site if you get no Force, since next turn you&#39;d be activating enough to deploy Lord Vader without any help.  You&#39;ll probably want to save your leftover Force if you have Vader or Blizzard 4 in hand, and draw if you don&#39;t.  Hopefully you&#39;ll get one of the two.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Rest of the game, basically set up on Naboo and drain until they come to you.  With Vader and his saber you should be getting a drain of 3 from one site, and then a drain of 2 from another once you set someone up there.  With all 3 Naboo sites out, you can also use the Resistance shield to cap out your opponent&#39;s Force drains at 2.  Right now my plan is to rig duel destinies using Deep Hatred, although if I encounter a CD(V) deck (which most light decks have) it&#39;ll be blind draws.  I don&#39;t currently have Ability, Ability, Ability (V) in the list, although I might try to figure out a card to ditch so I can put it in.  As for other cards:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Security Precautions, The Emperor&#39;s Prize (V), and Search and Destroy are there to harass decks like Hidden Base which keep Luke in space.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
2x Vader&#39;s Saber because I&#39;ve been advised that it&#39;s probably best to draw the opponent to me using drains.  I&#39;m contemplating switching one for Darth Vader&#39;s Lightsaber to help with blind dueling draws.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
They Will Be No Match For You: With 2x Maul Strikes, why not let Maul get in on the action? <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
2x Darth Vader, DLOTS: I opted for these guys over the EPP Vaders because of the immunity.  Keeping Vader on the table is big for Hunt Down, and I didn&#39;t want to get flipped back over just because my opponent drew a 1 for battle destiny against an EPP Vader.  I also decided I liked the choke ability better than the battle destiny decreasing ability of the Premiere Vader, though that&#39;s a personal choice.  And I kinda like the DLOTS picture better.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Ephant Mon: A little protection for Visage - prevents pesky punks like Corran Horn from showing up and ruining the party.  He might be expendable though - what do folks think?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Bounty Hunters and ships: If I get ahold of Jabba&#39;s Star Cruiser, I might opt for the virtual version of that along with Wooof (V) over Dengar (V) and Punishing One (V), just for the ability to pull another ship + pilot from Reserve.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Arica vs. Mara Jade: what do folks think on this one?  Arica&#39;s my only undercover spy, which makes her tempting to keep.  However Mara can pull her own saber, so I might perhaps be able to go with 2x Darth Vader&#39;s Lightsaber and ditch the Blaster Rack (V) since BFHI (V) pulls the DSII Vader&#39;s saber.  Another thing going for Arica is her once per game sniper-ish ability, although that may be countered out by Mara&#39;s ability to Epic Duel against Luke.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Deep Hatred: Is this worth keeping?  Or should I just get rid of it and put in some sort of tracking aid like Janus or Maul&#39;s Electrobinoculars (although, truth be told, I suck at tracking)?  Or, since I&#39;m looking for a slot for Ability, Ability, Ability (V) anyway, should I switch those?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Matchups:<br />
<br /><br />
I haven&#39;t played against many decks so I don&#39;t really know how the matchups go.  The only deck I&#39;ve played a bit against is Hidden Base, and that&#39;s fairly non-interactive until you get your ships out.  Basically the chance of a duel there is low, so forget using BFHI (V) to pull duelers.  You might even forego startng with BFHI(V) and instead go with Combat Response to get into space faster.  This deck doesn&#39;t have You Cannot Hide Forever, which makes it a bit tougher to pull out Security Precautions or Search and Destroy.  Once you do get Security Precautions out, though, probe with confidence - at least until you narrow it down to one or two systems.  My last HB opponent split his entire fleet between the two remaining systems, trying to bait me into a beatdown once I probed his base, so when you get to that point be sure to amass your forces.  Get out No Escape ASAP if they play Honor, otherwise keep pinging them to Visage.  Add on S&D, and Emperor&#39;s Prize (V) if Luke shows up in space.  Drain at your Naboo sites to add to the pain.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
