I do believe that it is a good deck mainly from my own experience playing. As any player on here knows, a new deck is always going to seem weird and different. I guess I shouldn&#39;t have attacked Scum the way I did. <br />
<br />
I guess I just don&#39;t like the fact that a deck like that exists, so I wanted to do my best to find a way to kill it. <br />
<br />
I do believe in this objective, and will build better ones in the future. <br />
<br />
Even though I think he could have gone about it in a better way, I want to thank Brandon for making me see the error of my ways. No hard feelings man, hope to play this out at Origins or Worlds. ********* <br />

The whole objective is completely awesome for lightside. Truly a very good deck to play against any number of dark decks out there, still not a believer, let me break it down for you then. <br />
<br />
The idea for this deck is to set up on Corellia and drain the game out. This objective is the closest thing to playing an old Dagobah deck that I have seen. BUT, these are all battlegrounds. Its all because of the cost of deploying for the darkside. You can set up Weapon Display (V) and Entrenchment (V) the whole game and force the darkside to try and do their own thing rather than come after you. So I dont hear about it in the rating, I dont have a Bacta Tank at the moment because I havent needed it to win. If I play against a deck that requires it, then I will find room. <br />
<br />
The Starting <br />
<br />
I start Dash and Leebo (V) because they are truly a powerful force on Corellia. When you get No Questions Asked (V) out, you get a destiny for power, attrition, and add 3 to your total destiny. As well as reducing the power of a poor starship it might face. I start Bargaining Table (V) to pull Laudica (V) as well as add forfeit to all of my aliens. Insurrection combo to pull the two docking bays, and force them to only use their Ellis during there move phase giving me the time to fight or run. The third effect will depend on your opponent. I have always loved playing with a deck that can set up to fight a specific deck. The three main effects are Quick Draw (V), The Professor (V), and Entrenchment (V) (all V set 9 cards). All of these effects are great against all different dark decks, the key is just knowing what to start against what deck. The majority of the time, I start Quick Draw (V), so my weapons always stay in my deck and I can use my lightsabers to hit vehicles. The Professor (V) needs to be started when you play against a deck that no matter what will be playing with free cards like CCT, Weather Vane, and Walkers. The card will literally slow the player down a full turn. Giving you more time to set up and auto win. <br />
<br />
Game play and set up <br />
<br />
Set up for this deck is VERY easy. Pull the No Questions Asked (V) during their turn or a site if you get one in your opening hand, and then another site before you activate. Pull the Home One: Docking Bay first, then the <> one. I usually, dont flip first turn, because I dont need to, I can keep all the sites in my hands, and most of the time, the darkside deck is using there force to set up their own deck, and will not just deploy one or two guys to your one site you might have deployed because of how much it cost them. Most of the time, I will flip second turn, by putting one Corellian on each then getting Mace deployed to the Home One: Docking Bay for his normal deploy and then moving him to the <> bay for free, I would then move the two guys together at one of the other sites. <br />
<br />
From there, you just fortify the sites with more powerful characters. Ideally, you want to get one of the big dogs at each site (Luke, Mace, and Yoda). Normally, I put Mace at the Farm by himself, Luke at the Docking Bay by himself, and then Yoda with the Corellians at the swamp. The rest of the characters are meant to fight in space or fortify the ground if they do come to you. <br />
<br />
The great thing about this deck is all the things the objective does for you. For the rest of the game, it will cost +3 to get ANY non Corellian, which means, lets face it, there are just no scary Corellians for darkside. The three Goo Nee Tays provide the chance to get it out EARLY, so that you can sit back and drain for 2 and 3 at all the sites while it cost the darkside a total of 13 to put a Maul with Stick on the docking bay. If they go to Maces site, then he will get to swing twice, not die to attrition, and block one of the weapon draws. If they try the Swamp, it will be 12 for Maul, plus they have to play +3 to battle there, so they have to save up 16 force to come down with just one character. Then they just get hit with a Rebel Barrier. <br />
<br />
The space is equally powerful with every Corellian in the deck being a pilot (except Laudica (V), but she just goes to the ground anyway) and BoShek (V) being able to deploy from reserve deck. I dont play with the Falcon because with play testing, I just dont get it out that much, and I would have to play with Squadron Assignments for pulling one ship. I still play General Solo because he is a Corellian who can pull interrupts, great for late game Corellian Retort (V) when I dont have it in hand. <br />
<br />
This deck works because it doesnt completely rely on there being a Corellian with another character for protection. I can set up with powerful characters who can hold their own and for the darkside to come after me, it takes A LOT of force. I even get to cycle through my deck and set up Out of Commission with Leebo (V) and Rebel Barriers with a built in lightside URRURURUR (V) text. That text also allows for major cards coming back with the one Flash of Insight (V) and the On the Edge, which can both be found over and over. <br />
<br />
There is still more that can be added to this deck, but I find that this format works best. Lets break down the match ups <br />
<br />
Scum  I start with this one because I know there are many that still believe this deck can destroy all. It does take a bit of a different mind set to win, but trust me, WYS (V) was made to beat this deck. Let me break this down so I dont get any nay sayers. First, no more Ellis Beatdowns, no bonus with Galid from Entrenchment (V). If they get their Molator (V) and Scum out, then they will get around Goo Nee Tay, but their guys still deploy +2, so they cant come down with 4 or 5 guys anymore. With this deck, you want to wait and flip second turn and pull all of your sites into hand. Save the farm until you have an idea of where their guys are. To start, you only want to deploy the Swamp and the docking bay, you will need to put down enough Corellians to prevent any kind of beatdown and so they will need even more force to battle you. A lot of the characters in a Scum deck are pilots, so they will pay +1 deploy at the docking bay, and +3 to just start a battle at the Swamp. The way to beat Scum is to never go to Jabbas Palace. You are draining for +1 with NQS (V) and +1 more where you have a lightsaber. As long as you have enough Corellians and Mace or Yoda, you are going to take out 3 to 5 characters at a site if they come to you, and all you lose in one character. You have a HUGE advantage in space so you want to make sure and take them out there first. Romas prevents the Cruiser from Reacting, NQA (V) adds 3 to your battle destiny, so that gets around Zuckess, and you can find two 4 ability guys to get around Maul, but since Scum decks dont play with Combat Response, Romas taking their Reacting away will be all you need to take them out of space. What you will find is they will be forced to do one of two things, 1) give up space and try to fight you on Corellia OR 2) Fortify their space cruiser with guys to eat up the attrition or put Jabba on the Cruiser, thus losing the Audience chamber. Majority of the time they are going to just lose space because they arent going to think about you being able to just take it from them. With no space means, no Occupation, and with Entrenchment (V) you will not lose but 3 force a turn that they will have to pay 9 for. The only reason you would lose this game is if you made a mistake, you have all the tools to beat Scum every time. After all of this, just try and tell me your Scum deck is still king. <br />
<br />
Huntdown  this deck only plays with HIGH deploy characters. Depending on the version; Vader takes 11 to 13, Maul is 12 to 14, Emperor is 10, Broken Fett is 10 (+2) for upkeep. You own space, meaning they will have to play for drains all game and you will keep the Entrenchment (V) going all game. The two OOC combos will keep the Visage off the table, plus I can pull Corran Horn to just control the site. Many games will find either Maul or Vader placed out of play with Leebo (V). <br />
<br />
Endor Ops  they do their thing, you do your thing. By the time they set up, you have already locked down all your sites and are draining for over 9. Entrenchment (V) will own their drains. They also cant hang in space. Their only hope is to invade Corellia with everything they have and not bother with doing any of their objectives. If they should do this, you will still have the advantage with Mace and Luke never leaving the table, and the fact that your space will be dominate. <br />
<br />
BHBM  this deck could win if they can win enough battles. If this was a defensive WYS (V) with small power character that are trying to hide in speeder, then it would be a hard game to win, but this is a power house version. Like Huntdown, they play with high deploy characters, and with the new Wipe Them out (V), they are using more of their card slots to play with non permanent weapons. Once again, you will own space, knock them out and then try and chose your battles wisely. You only want to fight when you can be sure they are not going to win. Also a great opportunity to Leebo (V) some key characters to their lost pile. Being smart on the ground, and winning space will give you the victory. <br />
<br />
Walkers  the reason for the Quick Draw (V) being in the deck. There are a lot of recyclable 5s in this deck so you can hit any Walker fairly easily but Blizzard 2. With this deck, you want to see what they do first turn. If they are looking like they are just going to hang out on Hoth, then you can go on and flip, but if they start coming to your planet or it looks like they are just using each turn to collect walkers, you want to just sit back and drain them until they commit somewhere. Watch out for Trample, shouldnt be that hard of a game. This deck idea is not what it once was. Mace (V) even gets two chances to kill a walker. Because they are playing with vehicles that cant just Ellis to your planet, you might want to consider not deploying the <> docking bay if you see that they are playing with the Hoth Docking bay. It would stink if they deployed all their walkers and just transited 4 over. <br />
<br />
SYCFA  the only deck that will fight you at the Corellia system. You will need to try and hold Corellia, which can be done with the Outrider staying on the table. You really have to set up the ground fast and start the force draining because they are not going to come to you anyway. Chose your battles in space wisely, you dont want to get Lateral Damaged and beatdown in space. What is always a good thing to do is get them to try and protect their Death Star from your Tantive IV (V), a drain of 4 becomes very bad if they eat it too much. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
********Before I leave, I want to add this one little strategy for advanced player only. I call it, Super Tracking********** <br />
<br />
What this objective has done is create a completely new way for the lightside to use and abuse the cards in your deck. <br />
The placing a card in your force pile to draw the top card of your reserve is totally broken with this deck. Let me break this down. <br />
<br />
This idea has created the opportunity to either put ALL of their lost pile out of play with OOC, OR get ALL of your lost pile back in your deck with Flash of Insight (V). This was always possible with Threepio, but because it was with your used pile, it was not as effective. You are now getting cards out of your hand to then use as a force to play cards like OOC or KeChu (V). You can also use KeChu (V) to put cards back as well. I know the better players are already going to know about this, but I wanted to point it out for those that may not have thought about it. <br />
<br />
This can only be done by playing these interrupts and effects in this deck as well as know exactly where they are to get them back in your hand, otherwise you are just trading a card you cant get back for another one. <br />
<br />
Well, thats it, please be kind, and enjoy playing it. <br />
