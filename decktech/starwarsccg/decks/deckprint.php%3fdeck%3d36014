I post this one because it’s a very good deck (what else) which gave me very satisfying results. But it is a bit weak against big blue ground/space decks that can set up a quick, decent drain in space and have the ability to challenge you on the ground. Decks that are built around Vader (like Huntdown) are difficult matchups as well. I consider this one not as a top tier deck but a tier 1.25 deck able to win large tourneys.<br />
<br />
<br />
GENERAL DESCRIPTION, BASIC SETUP<br />
<br />
Move and drain with Luke, protect him if possible, if he’s captured not by Vader let the opponent bleed two force at end of their turn. You have one of the strongest ground arsenals at your disposal to attack anything your opponent drops at sites. Cards like Padme, I hope she’s allright, I can feel the conflict provide an indirect way to deplete opponent’s life force. Superlando, angry Chewie + Han, Quiggy, Obi-Wan JK may form relatively cheap beatdown squads.<br />
<br />
The most important part of this deck are the high destiny cards: 11 destiny five and 5 destiny six cards. Many of them recycle back, only few of these cards are needed on table (and thus won’t recycle back in reserve). Average destiny is 3.1 at the start of the game but after few turns it should raise to 4+. There are two searchers for naked Threepio, he’s the best recycler for light side. I advise strongly to recycle only destiny 5+ cards with the droid.<br />
<br />
Reason for these high destiny cards: you need to HIT opponents characters and/or break the immunity if you want to win your games. With the high destiny it works pretty well to hit with blind destiny draws. Tracking is also an option, but it’s not easy to set it off whenever you want. Troublesome cards like Veers in AT-AT, Lord Vader, Lord Maul, tanks require a tracked destiny 6 or extra battle destiny to get around their immunity.<br />
<br />
There is no space at all, it’s just too complicate and reduces my destiny too much. I am addicted to high destiny cards ;)<br />
<br />
Character choice is meant for beatdown (2x superlando, angry Chewie, Han, Leia) and holding sites (the jedi).<br />
<br />
There are very few meta cards, I want to play my own game.<br />
<br />
Force generation is a very important part of my deck. I tested this one extensively against dark decks that give very few or no icons to you. Quite some cards are there for the locations only, but you need them. I can’t cut back. Luke is not always generating two force, so don’t count on the two extra force he may generate!! If no imperial at the DB, you start 6-1. Deploy the two 1/0 DB with the effect to activate 8-1. The Naboo DB is there as second BG against certain decktypes, but it is preferred not deploying it, instead take over opponent’s BG sites. Each one of your docking bays has a related twix to get around WTO. There are 3 search cards for the twix sites. Threepio is also great to fetch sites from reserve. If all locations are out you generate 13-2 from your own (without Luke).<br />
<br />
MATCHUPS<br />
<br />
I give some advise on the tough matchups. I took it to only one tournament (the European championship 2007, see my report) but intensive playtesting allow me to give info on important matchups. <br />
<br />
HUNTDOWN<br />
I consider this as the most difficult matchup, whatever the version is. Vader is the card you don’t want to see, and HD plays a lot of Vaders. The first thing you should do is fetch honor with YISYW. That will stop the visage damage a bit until no escape hits the table. Be very careful with Luke! Don’t move him over to the DB if opponent has enough force to deploy Maul and battle next turn. Maul +IHYN = game over! You must try to camp on one BG site with at least 3 jedi + protection for a safe drain and visage will turn against dark side. Hunt down is very vulnerable to their own visage damage. You must play very safe to have a good winning chance.<br />
<br />
FWKTIL<br />
That matchup is winnable if you take the necessary precautions.<br />
1. Keep Luke alone on Endor, he retrieves each turn! If an imperial captures him, no problem. If Vader is the imperial, go and catch him :)<br />
2. Get I hope she’s allright active turn 3 at last<br />
3. Grab control!! You can bait your opponent by playing early game an Imperial atrocity(V) (which will be controlled for sure). Imperial atrocity(V) may be retrieved back with Luke in opponent’s draw phase if you play it smart.<br />
4. No way the dark side may occupy a battleground site during their turn! Clear all sites! Obi-wan is the ideal character on the D* docking bay to deal with Palpy or Sidious.<br />
5. Try to find Padme and Leia for extra damage.<br />
6. If you have an early honor, play it. It helps a little bit in the beginning.<br />
<br />
RALOPS<br />
The saying “Mace on Ralltiir = win” is not true. What you have to do is attack the Ralltiir sites and make sure the site you attacked is empty after the battle. Don’t let the opponent attack you on their turn and retrieve with imperial domination! You have more solid characters than the opponent, weapons, SATM, resilience. After a few battles, Ralops will be short on decent characters but their red cards are dangerous. Try to flip them back each turn. Ralops gives you a lot of force icons, you basically have enough force to deploy what you want. Ralops is rather card-consuming, quick damage will hurt them hard. You’ll encounter the most trouble against Ralops vehicles.<br />
<br />
DARKSABER COMBAT<br />
I find this one very difficult, their ground forces are equal or better than yours. Here you must start with Civil disorder(V) instead of YISYW. Always use it to make combat cards lost. Your average destiny is quite high, mostly you will not lose combat with 5+ difference. If your character survives the combat, you are ready to fight back on your turn. I included the Naboo DB as second BG to transit Luke to Naboo and flip them back on a critical moment if necessary. Lord Maul is your primary target, you may not allow him to initiate combat, the odds of losing much force are high. Good thing is you get 4 force icons from the start. Use them.<br />
<br />
SENATE<br />
Start with Civil disorder(V) instead of YISYW. You must hit opponent’s characters with your weapons, don’t count on attrition. Senate is card-intensive, quick damage from Luke hurts them. You must at least control two BG to get around their drain cancelling effect.<br />
<br />
TANKS<br />
Whatever planet they are on, be very careful in the beginning or they come down with two tanks and four battle destiny. Camp on one site and spread out a bit mid-game, when their ground forces are elsewhere. You may attack them when they spread out too, but be sure you don’t eat overflow. A tracked 6 kills the pilot + tank, a 5 kills only the pilot. Tanks can drain very fast, but to set up everything cost quite some force and tank decks usually don’t generate that much from their own. And they give you 3-4 icons from the start. Use them.<br />
<br />
IG SUPERSTAR/CCT<br />
Here it’s difficult to say what you need to do: IG/CCT decks are versatile, you can build many versions of it. I give it a try. If they want a rebel, give them Lando. If they use frozen Han, move Luke to the DB and drain. Do damage. Add more jedi’s + protection to Luke’s location. IG deck usually ignore you to protect the captive the first few turns. Watch out for bounty(V)! Grab control if they play one (although the IG deck has many cards I want to grab). If despair is active, drop honor. That means they will move to the carbonite chamber very soon. If they do, try to set up an attack squad clearing the whole site. Your first target is Lando. Mandalorian mishap(V) and weapon levitation are the two GG cards against this decktype.<br />
  <br />
<br />
CERTAIN CARD CHOICES<br />
<br />
None really. My decks are not original, just simple and effective :).<br />
All cards are self-explanatory. Apart from SATM (cease fire cancels it) and Imperial atrocity (cancelled by control), none of my red cards will be cancelled (except with SAC). Playing this way has the advantage your opponent is stuck with ‘dead’ cards and you can play + recycle your high destiny red cards safely.<br />
<br />
I explain why I didn’t take certain cards in the deck<br />
<br />
Quick draw(V): I don’t have that much sabers and they are supposed to be on table so the +2 destiny is not relevant. A good defense against overload is to play without quick draw :). Sabering vehicles is not worth doing it. AT-AT’s are virtually immune to lightsabers, tracking a 6 to break immunity is easier than hitting them. Tanks need a 9 to hit them, which is still difficult with blind destiny draws. Only AT-ST’s can be hit on some occasions. It’s not worth to waste a card slot for this. <br />
<br />
Smoke screen, fallen portal: the latter is nice against back door HD, but both interrupts are cancelled too easy with Inconsequentional barriers (great card!). Let the opponent keep that card in hand until they realize (often too late) it’s a useless precaution.<br />
<br />
SAC: my objective can’t play alter. I remove the senses because it’s penalized easy and they are useless against certain decks. Also, I don’t like destiny 3 cards, only 5+ ;)<br />
<br />
61st card: not added because you are not allowed to play with 61 cards. The list is very long: clash, OOC/TT, 2nd Free ride combo, Corran, …<br />
