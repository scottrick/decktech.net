Ok, by request, I have decided to post the two example decks that I wrote about in my article; “Easiest Way to Teach a New Player.” Many of you have conveyed to me that you don’t believe MBO to be the best idea for a new player to play with. Many think that a complete battle deck is the best way to go, like TRMs, but I believe that in today’s environment, a new player must learn through one solid idea. Not a different strategy each game, but teaching them one deck and then just doing the same thing. A new player simply cannot properly play a deck like TRMs that requires them to deploy characters and battle against any number of problems the darkside might throw at them. <br />
I know this deck works with new players because I have taught two people to play this deck and win with it. They are winning more often with it then they are losing. <br />
<br />
If you look, the way this deck is built, it may have a few cards that will take some getting used to, but as a whole is VERY easy to play each and every game. Allow me to explain. <br />
<br />
Every game you do the exact same thing no matter what the darkside is playing. <br />
<br />
1 – Take Generals into hand <br />
<br />
2a – If they don’t deploy to Yavin IV DB, deploy any sites from hand, plus one from reserve, put both Generals and Tigaro (V) down and flip first turn <br />
<br />
2b – If they do deploy to Yavin IV DB, if you got a site in hand, same thing, but you will have to deploy the forest with Rieekan (V) and have another character in hand (does happen from time to time). If no site, then just draw up. NEVER DEPLOY ANOTHER SITE IF THEY ARE AT YOUR DOCKING BAY. (It is very common to get two sites in your opening hand too) <br />
<br />
3 – Once flipped, deploy Death Star from Reserve with Objective, if you have the force and either Luke, R2 in Red 5, or an All Wings Combo (play during their turn to try and keep from being Sensed), deploy them to Death Star with one of the 4 Tantive IV (V)s in the deck. Still if you have the force and you had the Advanced Preparation (V) in your hand or a Rebel Tech (V) on the table, go on and play it to get out the 3 cards under your Starting Effect. Proceed to blow the Death Star. (If no Tantive IV (V) in hand, then depending on the deck, deploy Luke to Yavin system and move)*********Only do this if they are playing a ground deck******** otherwise draw up and get the Tantive. <br />
<br />
4 – If all went right, Death Star should be blown away by end of second turn. Hitting them for 14 force. (Even more if against SYCFA), from here it is all gravy. Start Deploying the bigger ships for free and adding the cheaper ones from Hand. Always get Home One out first. Don’t forget to retrieve three with each one you deploy. <br />
<br />
5 – Drain at the three systems and any that the darkside provides. In time you will kill off all of their space in their deck. The battles are simply and mainly only deal in total power and one destiny. It is at this point where any new player can take care of the darkside and win the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, from playing this deck, you have to worry about a lot of things happening that will keep you from flipping let alone blowing the Death Star. This decks worst enemy is Sense/Uncertain is the Future. Because you will get everything you need to blow it, Luke, Tantive, Advanced (V) and then they willl play that card and leave you with crap and having to start all over. I once had a game that the player played it 4 TIMES!!!!! So I never was able to blow it. <br />
<br />
Those are the ropes with this deck. But that is not the point. I am not trying to get a great player to play this deck, but a new player. Someone, who if they built their own deck, would have even less of a chance to win even one game. This deck at least gives them a shot. <br />
<br />
The biggest reason to play this deck for a beginner is that it is VERY EASY TO TEACH. Once you have gotten past the basics, like just the phases. Then you move on to just teaching them what each card in this deck does. There are so many that do the same thing, that is only takes a few games going through the steps, and they have it. Each and every game they start doing their thing. You teach them what to do if the darkside does like one of three things that may happen, but that is it. There is much less thought process and it takes A LOT of the worrying of being beatdown at a site away. <br />
<br />
****Things to Remember to Teach New Players**** <br />
<br />
1 - NEVER leave a guy alone on the ground unless you have the Houjix (sometimes happens at the non-battlegrounds after first turn only) <br />
<br />
2 - Try as hard as possible to NOT get barriered, that is why there are 3 Inconseq Barriers in here <br />
<br />
3 - If you have to move Luke to the Death Star, DON&#39;T LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!! <br />
<br />
4 - In space, always remember to drain and retrieve every turn. Very important, and stress this ALWAYS, because they will take this playing habit with them as they grow. <br />
<br />
That is it. Please don’t base this deck as an MBO deck because I have played it enough to know what a beginner can handle and what they can’t. <br />
<br />
Please dmail me with any questions or concerns about this deck and how it has done with new players. And look at the darkside beginner deck "SYCFA for New Players" <br />
