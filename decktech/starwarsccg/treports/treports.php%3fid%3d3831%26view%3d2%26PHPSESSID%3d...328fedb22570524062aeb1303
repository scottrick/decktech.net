This was originally 3 separate posts to the swccg listserve shortly after Origins 1999, before I was a member of Decktech.  It is a fun little thing, so sit back and enjoy some of the names and decktypes that we don&#146;t see too much anymore.<br />
<br />
Part I<br />
<br />
It is 3:30AM on 7/5/99.  I have just finished browsing/deleting my 270+ messages and I will begin a long story about a great time in Ohio!<br />
<br />
I will break these messages up into themes, and they will be short and easy to read.  If you have questions about specific things reply to me only, so that others don&#146;t have to sort through it (unless it is a catchy comment that you think everyone else will like!)<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Top 10 Really Cool Things About Origins 1999<br />
<br />
10.  Excellent Facility!! (everything under 1 roof:  games, food, hotel)<br />
<br />
9.   EPP Overdrive - fast and furious (should be 20 min instead of 15, though..too many timed games!)<br />
<br />
8.   An Endor Foil set to the individual winner of Team Tournament<br />
<br />
7.   Team Format:  encourages team strategy along with individual achievement<br />
<br />
6.   Most registrants in a SWCCG tourney!!  over 140!!!  Way Cool!!<br />
<br />
5.   Girls Play Too!!  the 2 female participants were both from the Philly, PA area.  They used their Oola-esque charm and creative decks to pick up a few wins!  (fortunatly they didn&#146;t become rancor snacks)<br />
<br />
4.   The Philly crowd introduces the nemesis to traditional deck building strategy:  &quot;Exactly how many undercover bothan spies does it take to thoroughly annoy your opponent?&quot;  Kudos to Dan (yes I&#146;m ray&#146;s brother)&quot;King Joeblowkey&quot; Bordier for the idea!!<br />
<br />
3.   Finally putting names and faces together with most of you guys!!<br />
<br />
2.   Great Attitude among most players - The Albanians ( Albany, NY area) were a feisty but spirited group that demonstrated great sportsmanship and comraderie throughout the weekend.  Us Philly folks are looking forward to a few road-trips to occur in the next few months!<br />
<br />
1.   Justin Pakes was an outstanding master of ceremonies.  His easygoing personality and sense of humor helped create a really cool atmosphere despite some a few heated egos in the crowd.  He also managed to keep his clothes on in public for the whole weekend.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#146;m going to bed!!  Look for report #2 sometime later on the 5th!!<br />
<br />
Part II<br />
<br />
&lt;Yawn&gt; <br />
after 6 hours of high humidity sleep, I am prepared to share the next installment of my story.  I last exposed some of the things that made the past 3 days a great experience.  Unfortunately there is a balance that must be maintained, so the Anakin in me forces me to share the dark side of the weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Top Ten Things that Sucked at Origins:<br />
<br />
10.   Leaving Sunday afternoon<br />
<br />
9.    The awful 7 1/2 hour drive each way<br />
<br />
8.    The cost (45 weekend pass, plus 2.50 per event, plus 126/nite hotel room (taxes included), plus 30 parking in garage for 3 days, plus vendors jedi mind-tricking you into buying 75 worth of stuff)and uncooperative ATM machines in the convention center.<br />
<br />
7.    Endor Booster Draft (bend over, light side, and take speeder bikes up your garbage chute)<br />
<br />
6.    35% of the people quiting the open qualifier due to lack of success or sleep or motivation. (only 90-95 finished out of 140+)<br />
<br />
5.    Playing 6 people from my region that I knew between the open and the team event.<br />
<br />
4.    Time management - EPP games needed 5 more minutes each, big events went slowly, transitions were difficult..it was hard to count on finishing one thing to get to another then to get back in time.<br />
<br />
3.    Absent Friends (Marco Habert, Chris Janiak, Jon VanDermeer, Hak Soo Kim, Dave Diehl, and many more!!)<br />
<br />
2.    A few people still sporting bad atteetude (philly pronunciation) regardless of whether or not they did well.  Its just a game!!!  If anyone can make $50,000 a year playing swccg then you can be all serious and stuff!!!<br />
<br />
1.    You&#146;d figure with all the science fiction loving professionals and researchers they&#146;d find a way to warp time and space so that you can do everything and still get 8 hours of sleep in per day!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!  I have 2 more reports coming:  Episode III will be my big constructed deck games and Episode IV will be the silly stuff that happened <br />
<br />
<br />
Interlude<br />
<br />
Yeah, playing each other can be rough.  One benefit, though is one team member can be the whipping boy while the rest do well (read:  lets teammate with better chance win).  Fortunately my teammates were spared the agony of having to sit across from each other.  We were the mean, median, and the mode of the team tournament!!! (for non-stat dweebs, that meant we couldn&#146;t be any more average!!)<br />
<br />
our team finished as follows:  10th out of 19 teams starting the tournament.<br />
<br />
Our individual placed as following:  Tom Heller 4(21)30th place, Me 4(10)34th place, Kim Caton 4(1)40th place, Nathan Brown 4(0)41st place.  This was out of 77 people, I believe.  <br />
<br />
Due to the higher average age of our team (26.5 years),we were the Geritol Jedi and Perky Padawan<br />
<br />
This is a great concept and I hope team events can be held more regularly!!!  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Part III<br />
<br />
Okeeday.  We all know why we came this weekend, so here&#146;s my tale:<br />
<br />
Origins Open<br />
<br />
LS Deck - Maelstrom Deck.. a few quirky modifications that Mike Girard did not approve, but proved helpful in the long run.<br />
<br />
DS Deck - TIE LN/Asteroids/SFS/undercover spies  This deck has been tweaked for 4 weeks to its current incarnation<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1:   LS  v. TJ Holman&#146;s RBO Deck.  OK, not a promising way to begin, but TJ and I have been playing against each other for 2 years.  I know I can beat him once every 3-4 games, so I figure I got a shot.  He does not know what I am playing.  He appears nervous at first, but once he sees what I&#146;m doing he moves cautiously to set up his drains and occupation at Yavin, assisted by organa ceremonial necklace.  I pop a merchant and a droid where he has epp vader alone and speeders/activate enough to add epp han and luke.  I initiate, draw 10 attrition and han is left alone and he loses 12 more force.  I didn&#146;t have enough to move my gold leader from the system and he promptly clobbers me for a 14 force loss.  If I had that one force we both know I would have won the game.  TJ by 14. 0(-14)<br />
<br />
Game 2:   DS v. Stefan Moss&#146; Bothan Ops Deck.  Stefan is a young guy and he needed a few reminders about what cards did, but he got off to a quick start against me, using Ithorians to boost his drains.  It takes a few turns for the TIE&#146;s to get set up, but once the retrieval engine is working and my undercover spies are set up there is little he can do.  Highlights include landing 2 TIE Assault Squadrons at his Spaceport Docking Bay to block a drain and draw destiny.  Win by 14.  2(0)<br />
<br />
Game 3:   DS v. Marty Terwilliger&#146;s HB/X-wing Swarm Deck.  This proved exciting!!  A space battle galore!!  Interaction!!  Strategy!!  Probing for secret bases, avoiding asteroids at all costs.  All power to weapons versus organized attack!!  This is what its all about!!  In the long run, SFS proves to be crucial as lost TIE&#146;s go to the used pile and redeployed where needed.  Fozec makes his debut as an ISD pilot.  Critical moment:  I announce that Secret Plans was deployed.  About 6 turns later Marty has 9 x-wings on the table and plays All Wings..., but only has 6 force active so it is cancelled.  After 60 minutes, I have 21 cards to his 12 (9 difference...)  Timed win by 21. 3(21)<br />
<br />
Game 4:   LS v. Paul Tartaglio&#146;s Hunt Down Deck.  Big Question:  Can I retrieve faster than Visage makes me lose?  We&#146;ll see!!  Paul has some strong moments and was able to engage in a few battles, but I did not see him play or lose any Epic Duel Cards, which hurt him in the long run.  I had to use Transmission Terminated once to get rid of Visage and later deployed R2D2 and a H&#146;nemethe(not approved by Mike Girard) to the Holotheatre to cancel it again (Goo Nee Tay was also deployed, making vader deploy 10 there)  A battle group of 30 power, including Vader, Kitty Kat, Zuckuss, ad nauseum, was mysteriously lost while hiring transport from the Bothawui Spaceport Docking Bay to the Executor (Damn Mercenaries!!) The Drains are too much for him at this point.  Win by 11.  5(32)<br />
<br />
Game 5:   DS v. Aaron Kingery&#146;s Maelstrom Deck.  (YAWN)  Deploy, Retrieve, Drain....  Deploy, Retrieve, Drain.....(Stretch)  Deploy, Retrieve, Drain...  Highlights:  Wioslea buys an undercover probe droid OOOOH...AHHHH.  Critical Moment.  &quot;grabbing&quot; his speeders.. totally stops droid retrieval.. This was almost an exact duplicate of a game I had played with a friend for 2 hours and 15 minutes the week before.  Time is on my side, yes it is!!  Timed win 18 to much less (he didn&#146;t say..)  6(50)<br />
<br />
Game 6:   LS v. Livio D&#146;Alessio&#146;s ISB/Tie Defender Swarm Deck.  Between &quot;All Power to Weapons&quot; and Power 5 and 6 TIE&#146;s, I elect to stay on the ground as he controls space.  He is using undercover probe droids to slow down my drains.  I manage to circulate Chewbacca, EPP Han and Leia, and R2D2 on the falcon (power 10, 3 destiny) but still get my butt handed to me in space..  fortunately I was able to retrieve them again and within 3 turns they were back out there!!  Best moment of the game:  I restraining bolt (also not approved by Mike Girard)an undercover probe droid and pray for R3PO to come into my hand.  Livio just laughs as he knows what I am thinking and he shows me his restraining bolt that he will deploy on R3PO if I put him there!!!  We call Juz over about 5 times this game to clarify what can and can&#146;t happen to bolted droids.  I ended up moving a droid merchant over to R3PO, selling him to my used pile and make the restraining bolt lost.  I get him out again in 2 turns and Livio decides to break cover, but I can&#146;t battle him because his text is cancelled.  He is &quot;content&quot; losing only 2 force per turn.  Once again, time is on my side.  I have 20 force in my piles, he has 18.  timed win by 20.  7(70)<br />
<br />
Okeeday, so I went 5-1 with 3 timed wins!!  Not good enough to place, but good enough to brag!!  If the games had indefinite length I believe I still would have won them.  The retrieval engine in those decks is incredibly consistent.  Many thanks to Bart Robinson who gave me tips on how to maximize my force conservation with the TIE deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Team Event<br />
<br />
LS Deck - dagobah deck/train first test, lots of undercover bothan spies, drain at Kessel, AFA, Civil Disorder. No theme, just annoying!!<br />
<br />
DS Deck - It wasn&#146;t broke, I didn&#146;t fix it!!  TIE LN deck returns!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1:   LS v. Rick Buckner&#146;s Hunt Down Deck.  Rick is very annoyed with the bothan spies as they manage to cancel Visage my first turn!!  They are quickly defeated and he redeploys another Visage.  I forgo the training and put SOS on Cloud City to lure him into using another elis.  (GRABBED!!)  he disarms luke, duels..i elect to cross him because Rick has made this really cool overlay &quot;Son of Vader&quot; to put in my sleeve with luke.  Critical moment:  in the hype of using the overlay, he forgets to make me lose 5 force for losing the duel.  The spies do their dirty work and I win while I drain at Kessel, so I win by 8.  2(8)<br />
<br />
Game 2:   DS v. Matt Wright&#146;s M&amp;T Deck.  Aim High and Tantive IV kill the TIE deck.  He had a good draw and I couldn&#146;t activate enough to mount a counter assault against the Tantive and eventually a loaded Falcon at Wakeelmui.  The undercover spies hold their own, though.  Loss by 26.  2(-18)<br />
<br />
Game 3:   LS v. Geof Young&#146;s Ground M&amp;T Deck.  Augmented by Endor, this is a well-balanced character driven deck.  Bubo is on Tatooine, so I elect to &quot;bargaining table&quot; his drains at the audience chamber.  He deploys Tempest 1 and Veers to Endor to Drain for 2.. I put 2 undercover bothan spies there, armed with sense&#146;s to deal with trample.  He deploys Pol Treidum and blows cover for a spy the next turn.  Beatdown 33 to 1.  I Savrip the loss with my extra SOS&#146;s and Spiral and a few other cards.  The next turn he does it again, beatdown by about the same.. I Savrip gold leader, yoda #2, a bunch of bothan spies and some more cards.  He then gets out more sites and spreads out..  I manage to block some drains, getting Uncontrolable Fury on Vader late in the game.  He wins by 2 in the end. 2(-20)<br />
<br />
Game 4:   DS v. Greg Hodur&#146;s Revolver Deck.  I was not worried about this game.  I don&#146;t know why.  I played patiently as he spun Wakeelmui and later my big one, with me activating 3-4 force for much of the game.  Once he revolved his 2/0 sites, though, I deployed undercover spies everywhere!!  He admitted that there were no &quot;sorry&#146;s&quot; in his deck, I drained for 1 or 2 per turn at the revolved Wakeelmui (spending 3 force per TIE, I might add...) or in an asteroid field.  As time went on, he was losing more in drains than me, and with about 10 cards left in his piles I evadered his 5 revolutions.  I had the evader since early in the game, but I figured it would have a better effect if I waited.  Win by 30. 4(10)<br />
<br />
Part IV<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, that last post took a lot out of me!!  I had to go see South Park to get into some air conditioning..  Anyone catch the Jar Jar joke in that movie?<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the time I spent with all the other crazy swccg nuts this past weekend.  Everytime I see Kendrick I blame him for everything that has happened to me since I started playing this game on June 6, 1996.  He was running a demo at Crazy Egor&#146;s (now Millenium) in Rochester and I just stumbled in for a peek.  I think we have a really special community of players and friends here, with a variety of ages and backgrounds represented.  I think there should be a rule that says you can&#146;t win the world title if you weren&#146;t alive when the first movie came out...maybe I&#146;d have a chance then!!<br />
<br />
Just a few fun comments to wrap this up, otherwise I&#146;m likely to get all mushy and sentimental before I go sort out my Endor.  <br />
<br />
Top 5 signs you shouldn&#146;t come to the origins open:<br />
<br />
5.  You deploy Ozzel after your opponent deploys never tell me the odds<br />
<br />
4.  I just discovered that you are the one that took Jason Markley&#146;s cards after the team event.<br />
<br />
3.  You can&#146;t understand that unusual Australian vowel accent <br />
<br />
2.  You made this really cool ewok assault deck with no mains and toys to back it up!<br />
<br />
1.  You had a dream about winning... (sorry CH, I couldn&#146;t resist!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from Juz&#146;s long hike to be part of the show, Tom Heller flew out of Alaska just to be on my team!  How&#146;s that for dedication!!  And Jason Markley thinks I&#146;m weird?  I wasn&#146;t the one dressed like the grim reaper (that was Kevin Lanigan from Rochester, NY)!  I wasn&#146;t the one who went to the bar between games 5 and 6 then stumbled and tumbled around the ballroom afterwards (sorry Joe).  I wasn&#146;t the one &quot;ass this, @#$% that&quot;...and what about that psychic fellow?  isn&#146;t practicing witchcraft a crime in ohio? Yeah, it was a good time, and now I have to wait 374 days for it to happen again!!  (of course, there is always the worlds weekend....hmmmmm)<br />
<br />
OK let the revels begin!!  <br />
