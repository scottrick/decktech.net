PRE-TOURNEY STUFF<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
After the European championship on 4th July (where I ended short of a place in the final, see the report on my page), there was a gap of four months (I didnt go to worlds) for the next important tourney, the Hannover year ender.<br />
Euro-Emperor Chris Menzel (and other peeps) decided to convert the traditional year ender into a real MPC, and hold it in Bensheim (we already went to Hannover for the Ralltiir championship). The MPC would take two days: one day for a qualification tourney and day two the actual MPC with knock-out system (16 players).<br />
<br />
My buddy Kris couldnt come. He decides to go in hibernation until the next season starts. Bad thing is I barely playtest without him. Good thing is, almost nobody knows my secret plans for the MPC.<br />
<br />
I received a very nice proposal from Andreas to overnight in his house, which I couldnt refuse. On top of that, Cedrik wants to come as well and drive me to Bensheim (4.5h driving). He wasnt qualified for day two, but normally hes able to do it. If you cant finish top 5 in a tourney where the top 14 isnt participating, then youre a REAL scrub ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
MY DECKS.<br />
---------<br />
<br />
For Dark, I chose my own designed AOBS Boba Fett superstar. Its a modern version of an old skool AOBS built around Boba Fett SE(V) (the real superstar), IG-88 with riot gun, destiny 6 Emperor; and infested with destiny 5+ cards. My personal addiction is high destiny.<br />
I used it for the first time at the Ralltiir championship, with very good results. However, I found it a bit weak against Jedi infested decks like LSC, TIGIH mains & toys, EPP senate(which was popular during that time). I changed about 10 cards to counter this weakness. The AR, some new erratas and V13 helped my deck a little bit.<br />
It had a good matchup against the dreaded QMC aliens, but the latter didnt survive. Generally speaking, my AOBS is extremely good against decks using non-Jedi characters.<br />
The fact Johnny Chu won worlds with an AOBS (therefore drawing unnecessary attention to the objective) didnt change my mind. I want to play this one on the MPC. My version is completely different than Chu&#39;s. Also, it is able to win with very big differential, an important factor in match play.<br />
<br />
My light would be once again my TIGIH mains & toys (lack of good ideas). Personally, I find it a tier 1.25 deck, but it has a potential to win very big as well and to defend itself against popular dark decks such as HD, Senate, Ralops, fear, CCT, LSC. Every game will be hard, but there are chances to win, even in bad matchups. And the deck is also infested with high destiny cards, so I feel more comfortable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DAY 1.<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Already qualified, I decide to play some random games here and there and enjoy the food. Pommes frites! Cordon bleu!!! German Sausages!!!!!! The Bensheim dish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yummie  :d:d:d:d.<br />
I used my own designed Hunt Down (kept as reserve) and MWYHL (an incredible goof deck) to scrub around. Those games were very important to me: I made some terrible mistakes (lack of play testing) but at least I wont make them the next day.<br />
It was clear my MWYHL (see my page for the decklist) wasn&#39;t a good choice in todays meta, even though I like to play with it.<br />
Hunt down is a solid choice, but I followed my instinct and stick to the AOBS on which I have been working for 6 months now. Anyway, I expected most players to meta against HD, Chus AOBS, LSC so I was confident my deck would do its job.<br />
TIGIH is a very good choice against AOBS, so I hoped people would copy-paste Chus deck and concentrate on light senate, LSC etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DAY 2<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Sad news: Cedrik falls very ill and cant play today. Julian didnt come. We are only 11 today.<br />
The pairing is completely changed, I get a bye instead of facing Ralf. Next round I face Chris Menzel, who also n00bs out with a bye.<br />
<br />
I took notes, my report is extremely detailed (reason: see end of this round). Decktechers like details.<br />
Time to talk about the games! <br />
<br />
<br />
ROUND TWO<br />
GAME 1<br />
<br />
Chris is higher ranked and chooses to start with Dark.<br />
He plays Dark Senate with the desert landing site, Crossfire(V), EC(V) and IAO/SP. I start with Civil disorder(V), I/AH and Saitorr(V).<br />
My opening hand is ok, I have good characters but lack locations + searchers.<br />
<br />
Turn 1:<br />
Chris: uses Crossfire(V) to deploy Security precautions(V) on the spaceport DB, with Aurra sing(V) there. Fondor and a PE(the one that reduces BD) also hit the table.<br />
Me: I pay three to drain for one in Chief Chirpas hut. I download Hoth DB. YISYW comes from hand. Luke goes to the Endor DB. The cards I draw are very good to protect my Jedi.<br />
I could attack Aurra with Mace and saber directly, but chose not taking risks. Chris deployed the wrong PE (for me) and I feared a barrier + beatdown with Maul next turn.<br />
Turn 2:<br />
Chris: 4-LOM joins Aurra. Chris draws the remaining cards but has no luck finding decent senators.<br />
Me: I dont pay for a drain. I deploy home one DB and attack with Mace and saber. I try to SATM 4-LOM, but it is sensed and I didnt deploy the SAC shields. Chris sacrifices his Crossfire for an extra BD (at that point I know he completely lacks senators). My BD is a 0 (one of my twixes), but Chris BD also sucks and I resilience Mace without overflow. I achieved my goal with clearing the site, security precautions(V) goes to used and Chris activation is reduced to 8.<br />
Turn 3:<br />
Chris: thinks a lot, draws up and leaves some force. I guess he has his senators now :)<br />
Me: Drain with Luke at the Endor DB is cancelled (I did this move to remove senators from Chris hand), Mace + saber joins Luke. I feel confident when Goo nee Tay hits the table.<br />
Turn 4:<br />
Chris: he flips with Lott Dot and Yeb Yeb. Blizzard 4 and EPP Vader capture Luke and they chicken out to the spaceport DB.<br />
Me: I drain with Mace on Endor for 2 (Chris has no senator in hand) and when I check reserve my destiny sucks too much. I cant attack Vader with Obi JK, instead I deploy him on the Naboo DB and threaten Chris with at least one nice drain of 2.<br />
Turn 5:<br />
Chris: activates 11 now and drains for 3 on the DB. Tikkes joins the senate.<br />
Me: I activate 13. Both drains of two come trough, but that costs me 6 force and I cant attack Vader. I drop naked 3PO and draw up. Finally I find a twix and can plan for an attack next turn.<br />
Turn 6:<br />
Chris: I get drained again for 3, ZiMH comes to Fondor and Chris draws up.<br />
Me: I check my reserve and my destiny still sucks, despite the recycling with 3PO (goddamn floating twixes). I cant attack Vader with EPP Han and Leia or Chewie, enraged. To prevent my deck thinning too much, I transit Mace and Obi in front of Vader and hope Chris will take the bait by attacking me next turn. I have plenty of red protection in hand, I feel safe.<br />
Turn 7:<br />
Chris: drain of 3 on Fondor. Chris checks his reserve but his destiny sucks. He drops Dr. Dre on the Naboo DB and Vader + Blizzard4 chicken out (again) to the doctor.<br />
Me: this turn of events is unfortunate so I take my very last chance and attack Vader, Blizzard4 and Dr. Dre with Ki-Adi-Mundi (I use his game text to fetch a saber from my lost pile). My destiny is ok now (all 4 and 5). I SATM Vader, Luke is released and after BD is drawn, Luke has enough forfeit so Ki-Adi-Mundi remains on table.<br />
Turn 8+:<br />
I have lost too many force to launch an attack elsewhere. I know it will be virtually impossible to win, but after a short calculation I can play to end with a differential less than 10, which is ok.<br />
Suddenly time is called; we both have one turn left. Chris thickens his deck with Squabbling delegates (retrieving 4) and recycling senators from his PE.<br />
I cant recycle my weapons (away put your weapon(V) is lost early game to a drain) and face a time loss of 19 vs. my 16. I dont give a full win, because the game could last for 3-4 extra turns and neither of us knew what the other kept for a last second surprise.<br />
Because its a time loss, a full win of 1 next game is enough to go trough.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME 2<br />
<br />
My AOBS Boba Fett Superstar against Chris Menzels Über-Senate. I read Chris report on worlds and knew 100% he would come back with his all-time favourite deck.<br />
This is a very interesting matchup, both players are on Coruscant.<br />
I start with Crossfire(V), IAO/SP and AAA(V). Chris begins with Wokling(V), Strike planning and Seeking an audience(V).<br />
<br />
Turn 1:<br />
Me: I activate 5, drop a 1/0 DB, the flagship bridge with WMAOP and draw up.<br />
Chris: he does the usual Mon Mothma-Endor system stuff and found his twix (argh), giving him crucial activation. I fetch POTF with Crossfire(V).<br />
Turn 2:<br />
Me: I drop Information exchange(V) on Imperial city and download a Vigo on the 1/1 Coruscant DB. During the move phase, the nephew is joined by his boss and Emperor Palpatine, flipping my objective. I feel more tech than Chris by recycling all those lovely destinies back in reserve and checking my force pile every turn.<br />
Chris: Mon Mothma is joined by Senator Palpy in the senate and the objective is flipped.<br />
Turn 3:<br />
Me: I do one damage with my objective. Another 1/0 DB hits the table. I reinforce my DB with another Vigo, Guri(V), POTF and hope to find Bane Malar sooner or later.<br />
Chris: Tunnel vision, and then Tantive IV(V) + Bright hope(V) + Princess Leia(V) on my Coruscant system.<br />
OMFG this sucks elephant ballz!!!<br />
Turn 4:<br />
Me: I raise the pressure and drop more peeps to the ground. Emperor Palpatine sits on the Flagship DB, protected by two Vigos. Xizor, Guri(V) and Fett superstar camp on Coruscant DB.<br />
Chris: drains me heavy, I lose YCHF from reserve and this loss seriously reduces my possibilities to engage Jedi masters with IG-88. The senate landing platform (the new virtual 2/1 location) comes on the other side of Imperial city (very smart of Chris of deploying it there, I cant move there in only one  turn). Princess Leia(V) shuttles to the Landing platform.<br />
Turn 5:<br />
Me: once again P-59 and Bane are badly positioned in my force pile. I decide to pay for drains (one drain of two comes trough). My objective deals two extra damage so I  keep pressure on Chris. I deploy IG-88 with gun in front of the Princess, use my objective to check my top two destiny cards (3,5) and initiate battle. As first action I search for a Force Lightning (which isnt there) and my destinies arent as good as expected (50% chance to fail the capturing). My first destiny is a 4 (cancelled and redrawn by some obscure PE) and next I draw a 5. Chris grins evilly. <br />
Chris: drains me heavy again at the system. He drops Amidala + Überlando in front of IG-88 and draws up.<br />
Turn 6:<br />
Me: Under no circumstances I may allow Chris to occupy a BG during his control phase or I am pooped in less than three turns. I still havent found any other character not yet on table. I read the game text of the landing platform once more and on the light side game text I read starships may deploy there. After a drain and two objective damage, I drop an empty Infiltrator as forfeit fodder ( I know Chris destinies all suck and assume that forfeit 6 will suffice). In the battle step I use my objective to look at my top two destinies (3,6). I assume its OK and initiate battle. I capture Lando (after a redraw) and Chris stuns me with Ive decided to go back (now the Naboo witch draws two BD). I have to sacrifice my Crossfire for an extra BD to prevent overflow and I draw 5,6. Chris breaks my 6 forfeit and IG-88 is lost; Leia is liberated.<br />
Chris: with Princess Leia controlling a BG, he blows me with 7 damage. He attacks Emperor Palpatine and the two Vigos with Mace + stick + Smoke screen. I prevent total 0wnage with a Cease fire: Emperor and Mace remain. Chris was a bit too overconfident, dropping Mace to Leias site would have decided the game immediately.<br />
Turn 7:<br />
Me: I still inflict two damage with the objective but I dont have the resources to attack on two fronts. I attack Leia with IG-88 and capture her again. My top destiny after the battle is a 6, I transit Fett(who captures anyone with a 6) + Xizor + Guri in front of Mace. Emperor Palpatine chickens out to Coruscant DB. The early loss of YCHF screws me; if I had it on table Mace would be immediately zapped with force lightning. I move IG-88 to imperial city and try to set up my very last surprise (Emperor + IG-88 + Force lightning (used) can still capture Mace).<br />
Suddenly the bell wakes up everyone and time is called. I place some cards in used but I cant pile up 20 cards and I know the round is lost. Chris does the same thing as in game one and times me out with 20 vs. 16.<br />
<br />
RESULT: two TL with 19 and 20<br />
<br />
<br />
All details included because I scrub out with two time losses. BLAH!<br />
Cedrik joined us in the noon and decides to go back early. I concede my next game against Ralf.<br />
At this moment, I dont know who won the tourney.<br />
Winner is Nico or Angelo (see diagram below).<br />
I assume it is Angelo otherwise Nico would have bragged about it on all existing forums.<br />
At least I post my report before Nico does, LOL.<br />

DECKS PLAYED:<br />
<br />
I left the place earlier, havent got the time to scout the decks. In day two I saw Endor ops, WYS undercover spies, Huntdown, Watto, AOBS, TIGIH, Fear, Senate, Bespin CP, Ewoks, Hoth CR, Ralops, QMC, and Dantooine.<br />
A lot of annoying decks, but there are many different ones, making this tourney extremely interesting. I guess Nicos report will be packed with this type of information.<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
- big thanks to Andreas for letting me sleep and eat breakfast in your house.<br />
- Tamas for not snoring torturously. <br />
- The food is excellent. Bigger portions and considerably lower price than in Belgium. <br />
- Cedrik and Petra for bringing me to Bensheim.<br />
- The extremely good and relaxed atmosphere throughout the whole tourney.<br />
- The AR. Whatever people trash out on the forums, I find this a very handy, clear and useful document. Good job, PC!<br />
- I go to the quarter finals without playing. <br />
- Jörg for helping Tamas out after Cedriks illness.<br />
  <br />
Slops:<br />
- the flu virus that (unfortunately) attacked Cedrik with success.<br />
- the same flu virus for attacking Andreas: when he coughs, the whole place shakes and shivers!<br />
- Train strike in Germany, probably preventing Julian to come from Berlin.<br />
- Not that many players as expected, even though the date was set early enough (next year the European empire will solve this problem as much as possible).<br />
- Squabbling delegates and Might of the republic.<br />
- Two twixes in my reserve after 6 turns.<br />
- 9h in the car to scrub out after two games.<br />
- the dollar in free fall, most probably the main reason for USA players to remain at their side of the ocean. <br />
