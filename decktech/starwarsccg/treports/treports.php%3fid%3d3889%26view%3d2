<br />
Pre-Tourny<br />
<br />
Well I guess me wanting to go and setting up stuff to go all happend right after Regionals......where I got beatdown by Kevin in the last game by 5(i guess not beatdown) hehe(have fun in Japan).  So I started setting this up early with friends unlike last years last minute setup.  I get room and my badge stuff all finished before I go on Summer Vacation.  Summer hits and I dont get to a tourny but I worked on decks a lot and checking the Meta out on Dtech like reading Trs and decks all that goodness.  I narrow decks down to like 3 dark and 2 light..... for dark I got going... Watto(regionals deck), LSC Race, and Dark Deal for light LSC Racing or WYS racing.  I build them minus the cards I dont have triples of and have them around in case i feel the only im playing sux since hopefully I will get lots of games in with my local friend whos like 1900 player.  But things dont always go how you plan....  As you must all know isnt it everybodys SWCCG goal to qualify for worlds???  Well its mine but I guess not my friends cause we played one game... ONE GAME while I was on Vacation.  Not really testing eh..... but he says he can pick up a hidden base deck and play without any testing...... but I tell him (along with how many of you think that) that its changed and you need some skill to play it........ but he says no...... so wednsday before I leave I wish him a 0-6/8 tourny for him.......(i know not nice but he deserves it).  Well school started so I get to miss a day of random Junior classes during the first week... sw33t!!  <br />
<br />
Since Im flying down I leave Thrusday around 6 Pm and get in around 11...  finishing my MAIN decks which I decided to play (more info later).  I get home from school Thursday and get ready whatever else I need.  I grab my cd player and wait for the UPS man to come with my cards that I ordered like a week ago on 3 day shipping........ weak.  I eat a little dinner and throw my stuff in the car to leave by about 6-6:30.  Its time to go and no cards...... that sucks mega....  I just dont worry about it and decide to trade the stuff at the tourny.  The plane ride was uneventful and I sleep about half hour of the hour and half flight into beautiful San Diego.  w00t.  Its about 11 when we get to the Airport and we head to the hotel in a cab and check in for some needed sleep.  I wake up around 8 or so get ready and hop on this mad kwazy shuttle to the convention.  I get my badge and head to the Decipher Booth too see whos down there.  I run into Josh Certo whos teaching people how to play rings but hes not teaching anybody so I talk to him about decks and stuff since he cant play anyways.  He tells me my Watto is a little weak and might get beatdown and the Combat looks solid if I tweak it some.  I head up to the &quot;meeting room&quot; and talk to the Greens for a while and then Alfred and head back down to see what the Convention holds ahead.  I run into Brain Quan, Gibson Yim and Alex Shenyis..... or something like that..... some guys who used to play in Local tournys.  So I talk with them and go around convention before running into Paul and Casey.  We head off to random areas checking out stuff..... and I see the Game Skins booth....... sick.... but Im poor so I dont buy anything... crap.  Its about 5 now and were getting sick of this place and we head off to eat...... <br />
<br />
They all decide that lets just walk down some blocks and till we find some stuff..... so whatever.... and we come upon the holy land of H00ters..... so we eat there...... nothing GREAT about this trip to H00ters..............unless your G4Y cause this was sweet and they did YMCA good stuff.......... we go back to convention and watch some movie thing which I feel asleep in and went back to hotel before the day of playing.  I look at my decks.......... not very impressive..... LSC Racing and Watto...... so I bust out some cards and decide Ill just keep what I got instead of being stupid and changing.....  I sleep.......ZZzzZZ and wake up at about 8 or so and get ready and head off with dad.  I get there and theres a line to Vegas for people waiting to get in (already registered) and theres a line to &quot;Colorado&quot; for the people who arent registered....... @#$%.  The line moves insanely fast for how long it is and we get into the area but not the Convention Floor or the meeting areas.  I finally get in after waiting in ANOTHER line for about 30 mins and fill out my decklists minus the ls cards I need...... but theres like nobody here who has the stuff I need so I throw in a Qui-Gon and say whatever and play......<br />
<br />
Heres where it gets PATHETIC.......... Only 14 people showed up........ we got more at the regional.... WT&lt;)))&lt;&gt;!?.....  and along with that were only playing 4 damn games....... 4 games...... uhm G4Y.  Well whatever read the short short tr.<br />
<br />
Decks<br />
LS - LightSaber Racing....... yea<br />
DS - Regionals Watto with some changes<br />
ill post if you guys say something in your review.....<br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
<br />
DS vs Paul McKelveys Hidden Base suX0rz<br />
<br />
Well this is great...... against a &quot;friend&quot; in the first game........ he says he wants to tie..... I tell him that will fist us both....... he doesnt agree so I say play...... I get a ok hand.... I pull stuff with crush and activate while he pulls General Cal.  I drop Watto and Mighty Jabba there and hit him for watto damage.  He plays Endor from reserve deck and drops Gen Cal with GS1 there.  Saves 2 force and says go.  I activate and drain for 1 then he plays the Battle Plan Shield.  I can see on his face hes gonna pay so I put the Executor face down.  He PAYS.  Turn 2 Executor in a Watto deck....... and Thrawn also drops by.... I draw double to his one and he loses both and 1 breakthrough.  He plays another System with nothing there for the time being.  I drain and Jabba goes lost in the wilderness........ wtf...... u have it play it on Superman I mean Watto.  I drain with watto now that its gone.  I set up my hand and let him go.  Kashyyyk comes out and Wedge in Red 1 goes to Aquaris for activation.  I send someone to mos espa for flip and hit him for watto damage and drain before for a few.  Obi-Wan comes down against that guy and I barrier.  I drain and Watto Damage and send EPP maul down with i think it was like EPP Vader or like someone with 5 power...... I battle and Chop and he Chops the random guy... I think boba with Blaster.  I play I have you now and hit him for 10 more BATTLE DAMAGE.  <br />
He finally flips his Objective and I dont even bother Probing since I got enough damage going already.  I drop my Tatooine and play occupation and move the Big stick over there...... Battle Plan is hurting him badly and my occupation/watto is just killing..... After a few turns he dies.....<br />

<br />
Game 2<br />
<br />
LS vs Kyle Matisevics Hunt Down Dbays<br />
<br />
When I saw his starting I thought basic Hunt Down....... so this would be preety easy....  I start Goo Nee Tay over Honor....... seems like I never use Honor...... dunno.  I start up the race and he drops a few 1-0 Dbays and draws the rest and we lose to Visage.  I draw up the first turn and save some force and lose to Visage.  I race and he spends 10 for Lord Vader with a stick and I lose to Visage.  I send Qui-Gon down with a combat card and Duel him.  He draws a 1-2 where i draw a 5-3 so Vader dies and 4 goes off the top.  Visage.  Race.  CCDbay goes out and he saves force.  Visage.  I drain and Qui gets a stick.  Visage.  Race.  Mara with Lightvibrator and Xizor goes to the CCDbay.  Visage.  I set up Luke with a stick to the other Naboo Site for faster Visage death to him.  Visage.  I win the race..... w00t.... he plays SP shiled and something else but no worry I got like 7 force saved he drains for 2.  I retrieve with plans and he loses 6.  Visage.  All his shileds are out now so Billy Dee destiny 5 comes out and numbers go in.  He activates numbers pops...... 12 to 2 he eats 10 and dies to Visage..... after I get 4 from I did it.  FW(+32)<br />
<br />
Highs:  I suck at this game<br />
Lows:  He seemed like a newbie <br />
<br />
Well Paul aka friend i wanted to go 0-6 is now 0-2 losing to Super Nghia lol.  Go Nghia.  <br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
<br />
DS vs Norman Perions LS Dagoboring....<br />
<br />
This was a somewhat differnt Version of Chus Dago deck with the Visored Vision and racing and training and so on.  I start off fast cause I know ill need the early damage.  I have Sebulbas Pod so I flash and draw a 4.  I set up Watto and Mara with stick and hit him for Watto Damage and draw up.  He uses a Visored Vision to hit me for 1 for I have you now.... (damn Polorized Negative Power).  I activate 1 on his turn from wipe them out.  He drops down Yodas hut and Yoda from reserve deck, inserts afa and draws the rest saving 2.  I drain for 1 with mara since her stupid lightsaber then race draw a 5 he draws some stuff.  Drain with Watto and place a Vader face down and he loses 2.  Seach and Destroy comes out and he loses one to that now.  He activates draws S&amp;D.  We race and I draw a 1 now crappy.  Drain, Drain, Watto damage S&amp;D.  Save some.  His training area flies off the top.... like it matters though.  I play the anti inserts shield.  He makes an Attak to kill my S&amp;D.  Obi wan with Stick and Lando Scoundrel come down against Mara but he has 1 force left to battle so I cancel it with Projective Telepathy.  He loses 2 and lando goes to used.  We race and I draw Emperor to his like 5,5.  He has 23 and I have 28.  No step backwards???  I win the race hehe.  He plays the anti race shield so he loses 3 and i get back 6.  I go for the beatdown on Obi-Wan with Vader and mara finally gets a stick.  I battle with first strike.  He too close for comfots my slice with mara and Vader sucks and hits himself in the face...... Mara gets chopped.  I have you now draws 2 more 1s.  So 2 big characters cant kill obi duel to Yoda and anti attrtion.  He loses 4 for differnce to Obi doesnt die.  I get back the Mara, stick, Vader, S&amp;D and I have you down from the race and he drops 3 more.  Hes low on force.  Luke makes a strike against Watto but I react with Tempest Scout 6 so only Watto dies and Luke eats it but comes back with Resilence.  I do something stupid here.  I drop Ponda and Dre Combo and Watto to damage him and play P-59 but dont battle...... stupid and I run them away wtf is wrong with me.  Zuckuss flies up to Tatooine for occupation and move the 2 over.  I finally kill Obi with Vader and the ping drains and occupation with watto finally kill him off.  FW(+26)<br />
<br />

Ls vs Nghia Nguyens HUNT DOWN!!! EPIC!<br />
Blaster Rack, Mobil Points, Crush<br />
<br />
LOL Nghia is so fun to play against..... we laugh all the time over the stupid moves each other makes.  Goo Nee Tay over Honor again.  Sebulbas Pod for him.  It gets funny right from the start...... Nghia first...... goes &quot;looking with mobil points&quot; with his broken @#$% english.  Hes like where the hell is it........... Gibson goes did u look in your hand..... he goes oh &quot;5hit&quot;  so i look at his deck and laugh and laugh..... lol......  He then before he activates goes... destiny for the race...... and I go d00d activate...... lol we laugh at him again... oh we is Brain, Gib and Alex.  So he activates and we race he flashes and draws up some.  Visage.  I activate and save like 2-3 and draw.  Visage.  We race and he gets out Wakumi and a DPerimeter with p-59 there from outa nowhere and saves most.... draws.  Visage.  I go for it and drop Jedi Luke with Stick to Generator Core with a stick and save 1.  Visage.  Race hes drawn like 1,1,site and now a 3 where i got like 24 now.  He comes down with Choke Vader with stick and goes hmmmmmmmm for like 2 mins....... then outa nowhere.... Obsession... oh 5hit i say.  But run luke run kills it and he battles but I dodge away which he grabs.  Visage.  Qui-gon with his stick go down and get a Combat card and Vader loses 4.  Visage.  I win the race and Occupy 2 Bgs for Coward and have 6 for the SP.  I think Im set...... but not really.  I shoulda saved more....  that Choke Vader is still sitting in front of Qui-Gon.  I have 2 choices both of which I dont retrive....... and he knows.  So I decide to stay and fight him.  He battles we chop each other and both draw a 3 for nothing..... He plays Coward and loses like 4 cause he got 2 Bgs.  His drains are taking toll and so is Visage but I have the Upper hand.  We drain back and forth for 3 or so turns....... me for three him for 2 and 6 from Visage.  I draw up 3 cards and get.... Lando, Yoda, Numbers.... Maul with Stick comes down and I its a trap it.  I bring down Lando Yoda and Dont do that again insert.  Combat.  Visage.  Battle Plan.  He activates and dies to numbers.  FW(+11)<br />
