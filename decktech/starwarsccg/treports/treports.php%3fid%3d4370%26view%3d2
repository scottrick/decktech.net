<br />
This Tournament is gonna be huge. Jeff Cook is running it in Glen Burnie. I can&#39;t wait to go, so almost all week (starting the Friday before) I try to make decks that are balanced enough to win against anything, but able to keep a pretty high differential so I can definitly make the final. <br />
<br />
First decks are DS Senate (I&#39;m kinda ed up in general, so it&#39;s kinda hard to gauge, on my page) and LS Combat. I decide that senate will probably lose to light senate if they tech for it, so that&#39;s gotta go because I know a few others will be playing Light Senate. Make an untested Combat, starting Blaster Rack, IAO Combo, and Mob Points. <br />
Standard combat, but I pack 2x Stop Motion cause cancelling Dodge and Arconas is cool. <br />
<br />
LS Combat is solid, with racing and a pretty good space package (Wedge, Luke, Falcon, Spiral). Everyone always pulls the Reactor Terminal shield against me, but I&#39;m not sure thats the best way to go. Whatever.<br />
<br />
I play in a swiss 4 game tournament on Saturday the 19th, going 3-1 with wins against a pretty solid MBO, DS Senate, and TIGIH. My LS loses against Imperial Occupation / Imperial Control, which pretty much suprises the crap out of me. Jon grabbed my Sense, which was game ending, cause I couldn&#39;t hold a system in space and therefore couldn&#39;t save 2 battlegrounds. I tossed Aquaris to an early drain, so I couldn&#39;t even touch Hoth. This stressed me out, cause I was sure my deck could take walkers. I tweaked it a bit, but tossed it out in favor of a new TRM deck I built.<br />
<br />
TRM gets tossed, because I realize I can&#39;t even play Revolution on Hoth locations against the new objective. I think it would be pretty solid against most decks, but I want to be able to hurt more, and lightsabers can&#39;t do anything against Walkers.<br />
<br />
WYS is my new deck, with 4x EPP Luke, 3x Clash of Sabers, and 3x Sorry About the Mess Combo. I can go for the beats with EPP Han and 3x Don&#39;t get y, or just keep Luke in the Cantina, and Definitly be able to hold a battleground site. I end up scrapping this deck, because Menace Fades won&#39;t work against Walkers, and I don&#39;t have space for <br />
Nick of Time to cancel Trample on Han. <br />
<br />
Let me just say, I don&#39;t think IO/IC is broken, but it is really strong against alot of decks.<br />
<br />
I pick up the combat deck, decide it&#39;s the best all-around deck I have, and add Under Attack, 3x Out of Commission Combo, and Heroic Sacrifice (for Blizzard 4 or PCP Fett).<br />
<br />
Dark side is a little easier. I know the Senate is real solid, but with all the LS Senate decks I know are going to be there, I decide it&#39;s a little too risky. The DS Combat did really well in the Swiss, so I step it up with another Force Field, Arica, and 2 control combos for <br />
any SAC I might see.<br />
<br />
Enter Thursday: Scott Lingrell posts that he, Greg Shaw, Bill Kafer, Ray Bordier, and Jonathan Dansbury will be making the trek down to MD for states. This is gonna be awesome. We&#39;re looking at about a 20+ turnout for the tournament, and that&#39;s huge for MD. 2 years ago states only had about 26, with only MD people there.<br />
<br />
Saturday comes, and I am pretty hyped. I got alot of sleep, and my decklists were already done. Through the driving rain, I finally make it to Games, Comics, and Stuff. I&#39;m the first one there, so I talk it up with Jeff and go over my decks with him. Jeff has seen me scrub out pretty bad in 2 Final Confrontations I&#39;ve been in (2001 MD States and 2002 Yavin 4 Regional), so he jokes around with me about that and how, with the NJ guys coming down, I shouldn&#39;t embarrass myself. Uncool. In total, we end up with 21 people, which rocks. I built decks for my friend Kevin Slattery, who is just sort of getting back into the game. He has the WYS and a Scum with Dark Jedi that starts Crush the Rebellion, so once I flip I can go for giant beats with Vader and Fett or Maul in space. It&#39;s fun. But, 5 minutes before the start of the tournament, we realize I left out the Tatooine Docking <br />
bay in the WYS, so we have to change the objective for Rendevouz Point and play it as is. Not cool.<br />
<br />
ON TO THE GAMES!<br />
<br />
Game 1: My LS Combat vs. Jonathan Dansbury-Court Mains with Heavy Space<br />
First turn, he plays Blizzard 4 and Vader (for free) to Great Pit of Carkoon. Well, this satisfies Court, but he can&#39;t drain. I put off winning the race until he forces me to lose 6, and then finally deploy to space with Wedge. He drops Guri in Stinger, I barrier, and he ends his turn. My turn, I drop Luke in Ship, and Han, Chewie, Falcon, and <br />
force a little overflow. I end the game with about 3 cards in lost pile, because he can&#39;t really kick me out of space and he can&#39;t drain with Vader. FW 2 (+38)<br />
<br />
Overall: 2 (+38). I am the top seat.<br />
Scott Lingrell, Greg Shaw, Jon Westergard, Kyle Hartline, Jesse Hartline, Bill Kafer all win thier games. David Lanking, from Michigan now in DC, also wins. Now that I&#39;ve looked him up, turns out he&#39;s pretty good. 2035 on the ratings board! I don&#39;t know exactly who he played, but he ended up 5-1 with a timed win, which is what kept him <br />
out of the final.<br />
<br />
Game 2: My DS Combat vs. Kyle Hartline - Hyperdrive Generator deck <br />
First turn, I drop Maul with Lightsaber. His first turn, he drops Obi Padawan Learner with Lightsaber, Proficiency, and Meditation to the Junkyard. Ouch. My second turn, I drop Piett and Merrejk to the Executor Docking bay, and Arica to the Junkyard, which made this game as unbalanced as it was. He uses to SATM combos, but can&#39;t find one. By the time he does, he misses the swing and thats pretty harsh. So, the <br />
whole game consists of me draining for 4 with Maul, 2 with my 3rd turn Executor and Chiraneau, and 1 at the Holotable. He finally gets Han and kills Arica, but by then I have Vader and Palpatine on Tatooine, and 2 Controls to cancel drains. By the end, I&#39;ve cleared all his characters. <br />
This was like a 15 minute game. FW 2 (+28)<br />
<br />
Overall: 4 (+66). I am the top seat.<br />
Scott, Greg, Jon, Jesse, and myself are the remaining 2-0 players. Game 3 Pairings: Me vs. Greg Shaw, Scott Lingrell vs. Jesse Hartline, and Jon vs. someone 1-1.<br />
<br />
Game 3: My LS Combat vs. Greg Shaw - Broken Senate<br />
This is a bad matchup for my deck. Senate usually fares pretty well against LS Combat, and with Greg behind it, this is gauranteed to be a tough match. His first turn, He drops a matching Interceptor and Pilot to Naboo, which stays there all game. First turn, I draw really crappy race destiny, but get an Escape Pod, to pull the Hologameboard. Also have a Houjix in hand. I play Qui-Gon and Houjix at the gameboard, and draw the rest. He flips second turn, but without Lott, and pulls a Political Effect. My turn I drain, and he topdecks the subtract 3 political effect, which hurts alot. He pulls the Coward sheild, but not before I drain with Houjix. Vader comes down against Qui-Gon while the race is still going (he hasn&#39;t been stacking destinies, but I can&#39;t seem to draw anything high), but I barrier. He has the combat shield out, so on my turn I opt for stacking my Artoo in Red 5 for Combat destiny instead of dropping to space to try and take out his ship, who doesn&#39;t yet have a cannon. I drop Leia, and OOP Lott Dodd, the turn before he later told me he was going to pull Maul. I Combat, but lose cause I draw a 3 and 7, while he draws 11. Unbelievable. Play Escape Pod to pull Projection Of A Skywalker, but his turn he puts it back in my used pile with Obj. text. I&#39;m tracking that 6 and I have a 7 to stack on Qui-gon, so I Dodge away from the <br />
battle, and finish the race that turn, retrieving my 6. I played to space, but LUke died twice to attrition, so I can&#39;t occupy a battleground for I Did It!. He has Abilityx3 out, but I deploy someone to space or a Jedi every turn, so nothing comes of it. I finally beat Vader in 2 Combats, getting rid of him and 8 force. Sidious was at the Podrace arena, but he&#39;s now unable to drain. wedge jumps in Artoo in <br />
Red 5 and moves to the Death Star, since now I have two battlegrounds for Coward. I lose two to Abilityx3 once, and he hits me with Limited Resources for 4, but it is too little too late. I drain in space and ground, for a win by 8. Tough. FW 2 (+8).<br />
<br />
Overall: 6 (+74). I am the top seat.<br />
Jesse gets a TW against Scott, and Jon wins his game. 3-0 players are myself, Jon, and Jesse, who has a timed win.<br />
<br />
Game 4: My DS Combat vs. Jon Westergard - LS Senate<br />
Jon has this awesome Senate deck, he&#39;s been talking about breaking it out for States for a few weeks. Well, it&#39;s time to see what it&#39;s about. First turn, Maul to the 3/2 site. He drops a ton of stuff, getting his second turn generation up to 17! I need a Stunning Leader, but alas, none to be found. I drain for 4, and he plays Vergence of the Force. Well, I Move over, so I can continue to drain for alot. He comes down with Qui-Gon and Lando, Scoundrel, killing Maul but causing little overflow because I Force Field the lightsaber and he draws low. retrive the lightsaber when I flip back. 3rd turn, I drop another Maul, which he lets me drain once with and then he kills. Well, by the time he flip, his lost pile is pretty big. I continue to drain sometimes, while <br />
he has nothing going except a few battles. After I kill of the last of his characters on Naboo, I drain him at both sites and we have a brief battle in space. He never really did any damage until the end, when he got Mas Amedda out, and moved Boss Nass and Rep Been to a <>Forest. I beat him out of space, then drained him out. FW 2 (+22).<br />
<br />
Overall: 8 (+96). I am the top seat.<br />
I am the only remaining undefeated. If I win the next game, I am in the final. Jesse loses to Greg Shaw.<br />
 <br />
Game 5: My LS Combat vs. Bill Kafer - Build the Death Star 2 Ties<br />
I race really slow again (Argh!), but by the time I win the race and drop I Did It!, I get back most of my lost cards. He iting me for a few drains of 2, but I keep battling him off the system the Death Star is orbiting, so I lost no force to that. He never drops a TIE Cannon, so all space battles are pretty solid. At one point, Han, Chewie, Falcon cause about 7 overflow, which was pretty big. My continuing drains on the ground and Obi battling him away from his <br />
Battleground docking bay seal it for me. FW 2 (+26).<br />
<br />
Overall: 10 (+122). I am the top seat.<br />
Scott is the top 4-1, so we play. If he wins, he&#39;s in. I&#39;m in, cause my differential is so high. If I beat Scott, then the winner of the Dave Lankton vs. Jesse Hartline plays me in the finals.<br />
<br />
Meaningless Game #1 (Game 6): My DS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - RTP<br />
Well, it turns out Scott is running a Rescue the Princess deck hell-bent on killing combat. So, since I&#39;m in the final, I don&#39;t do everything I probably could&#39;ve done. He frees Leia 3rd turn, while I still haven&#39;t gotten a jedi on table. I play a guy on the ground, he kills them and they go OOP. Maul, Vader, Merrejk, Piett, and Palpatine all fall this way. I have a destroyer with Chiraneau in space, but I <br />
have to pay 4 to drain and he drains for free with Leia and for 3 with Luke on Naboo. By the end of the game, I&#39;ve wittled him down to 13, but this was a pretty uneventful game. There were alot of battles, but nothing surprising or interesting happened. Prophetess did manage to survive almost the entire game, but eventually succumbed to EPP Luke. FL 0 (-13).<br />
<br />
Overall: 10 (+109). I am #1 after 6 games of Swiss.<br />
<br />
Scott makes it to the final, since he beat me in game 6. David won his last game vs. Jesse and had a higher differential than Scott, but since he had a timed win, Scott was in with 10 (+60) or so.<br />
<br />
Prize support is handed out, I get a Foil EPP Maul and a few packs. First place in the final will get an uncut sheet, and the bye into day 2.<br />
<br />
I decide to play my LS first, since I have a lot of confidence in it, and it can get the big win.<br />
<br />
Meaningless Game #2 (Final game #1): My LS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - CCT.<br />
Scott&#39;s Carbon Chamber deck is based on the premise of stopping me from playing Lando or Han all game. Well, he made a mistake about that, which gave me a oppurtunity to end the game pretty fast (more later). First turn, I forget to race. Idiot. Well, I pull the Hologameboard and have a Houjix and Projection of a Skywalker in my hand. I play Yoda to a site and Houjix to the gameboard, and draw up. The race starts off really slow for me, drawing a 6 and a 0, while he draws a seven (Phantom Menace). I try to use A Step Backward to put back my 0 and his 7, but it&#39;s ruled that only my 6 goes back, because he doesn&#39;t have a podracer. It makes sense, my fault. He drops Blast Door Controls, but I neglect to pull my Alter with Yoda. He drops 4Lom, Xizor, who I can&#39;t barrier, and There is no Try Shield (after I alter Blast Door Controls, but Xizor is already on table). He initiates, kills Yoda, and he still has Xizor. My turn I drain with Houjix, and draw a few. He plays Lando and Ephant Mon to the Security Cell, and moves Xizor over to the 3/2 Naboo site (holding Stunning leader and a barrier). <br />
<br />
I have Lando, Scoundrel in hand. Scott says I can&#39;t persona replace, because I don&#39;t have presence, and Persona Replacement requires presence, because under &#39;Persona Replacement&#39; it says I must obey the cards deployment restrictions. After much discussion with Jeff Cook (TD), it is decided that presence is not Lando&#39;s deployment restriction. So Lando, Scoundrel replaces his Lando, and Wedge Antilles, RSL joins him.<br />
<br />
I also play Epp Obi-wan against Xizor, because he still may have a Houjix in hand. He barriers, but I sense and lose 2. I battle with Obi, hitting and sending Xizor to used, ending the battle. I battle Ephant Mon with Wedge and Lando, he plays Stunning Leader, which I sense, and lose 2. He loses Ephant Mon and 7, cause I drew bad destiny. I move Lando and Wedge over, to satisfy Coward, and pay upkeep for Lando. I win the race, and he drops Vader to try and kick me off my second battleground. I Barrier, so he can&#39;t, and he doesn&#39;t have Reactor Terminal shield or Secret Plans shield so I retrieve 6 and he loses 6. He is down alot now, and I only have a 5 card lost pile. I use I Did It! to get back 4 more, and battle away Vader with Corran and a Dodge to kill his weapon destinies. He flips with a second 4-Lom, but it is too little too late. P-59 comes down to kill Wedge and Corran (after he Set for Stuns Lando) but I Barrier. I drain a few times for a win by 37.<br />
<br />
37 in the first game of a final confrontation is big. His LS beat me, but by 38 a second time? I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;d have to be S.O.L. (hehe Scott) to let that happen.<br />
<br />
Meaningless Game #3 (Final game #2): My LS Combat vs. Scott Lingrell - RTP.<br />
I get a first turn Maul, who drains all game. The turn he would pop Leia with R2 I Set for Stun him, and when his Never Tell Me The Odds pops I have Palpatine on table so we tie. He tries to kill Maul a few times, but never hits with the lightsabers and takes overflow most of the time. After about the third turn, when I SfS R2, we both know it&#39;s over. He tries to knock out my Jedi, but eventually I just wear him away with Palpatine, Maul, and Ghhhk at the holotable. He never flips.<br />
I win by 30.<br />
<br />
So, I win the MD state Championship. Cool.<br />
<br />
I WILL be at Mystic Visions. See you there.<br />
