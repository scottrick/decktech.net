I can&#146;t take my 2001 jetta (outrider) b/c its a lease and i have to preserve the milage.<br />
<br />
So finally my mom caves for the saturday morning tourney, and me and steve start talking to get ready to rip S. up.  After hanging out with my friends all night, i get to bed friday night at like three, i pull my alarm out of one of my boxes and set it up to wake me up at 823, and tell my parents to wake me up at 815.  <br />
<br />
Well my parents being the avid exercisers that they are, decide to go walking at like 8 and tell my beautiful but insanely retarded sister (whom steebo and many others are in love with) to wake me me up at 810 before she leaves to work.  Apparently, to her, waking me up consists of her opening my door, saying &quot;mike wake up&quot; and leaving for work so that she can get a french vanilla coffee at dunkin donuts before she had to be in at 830.  Now this would be all well and good if for some reason i happened to set my alarm correctly.  For anyone that ever watched seinfeld, you might ask: a. did i mix up the am/pm? b. was it the snooze? or c. was there a seperate knob for the alarm volume?  well it was A. i am retarded and i set my clock for pm and my alarm for am, so they were all f&#146;d up.  Needless to say, later that night my alarm scared the F out of me while i was typing away at my computer.  Anyways, i get the call at 915 from steebo that it is in fact 915.  Actually he called my brother and made him wake me up.  my brother is way better at waking people up than my sister.  So we have to be there at 11 and the thing is 1.5 hours away.  you do the math, we dont have good shots at making it right now.  I get up brush my teeth wash my face and pits and bolt for the door, forgetting my cd&#146;s but remembering my decks, which is good.<br />
<br />
I tell steve to make me some breakfast while he waits for me and he friggin puts cream cheese on my bagel so thats gross, we stop and get gas and my breakfast is now a half of a bottle of pink leomonade and a melted snickers.  steve got two bagels and a sprite.  we&#146;re off to a terrible start.  Normally, if the tourney was in MASS i&#146;d haul @#$% to wherever we had to go because my dad is deputy cheif of police in the second largest city in new england, but in CT ive been pulled over like 30982492783 times and have had to pay like 248392845 dollars in tickets because CT Staties are PIECES OF S&gt;HIT.  So we get there with like 5 minutes to spare, this place is in the ghetto, you dont think of ghetto when you think of CT, but this place was so ghetto.  There were all these big huge scary african american males loitering outside the barber shop across teh street screaming and it just made you feel good to be an american.<br />
<br />
So we sign up, brentson is there, the CT state runner up is there, and we are pumped.  Steve goes with Chu&#146;s Biker rops and ten numb superstar (avatars qmc but better) and i decide on bring him up the anus (my bhbm 7s) and the same qmc.  ONLY my qmc has 59 cards becuase at the last game of states i played a TDIGWATT deck and the kid genked my carbonite chamber.. which is terrible, because i dont find this out til game 6, when i really really need it to celebrate and dodge to.  Of all the cards that couldve been missing, i wouldve liked to have that site.  Steve&#146;s rating going in is 1969, mine is 1654.. but my days of scrubbing are now over, as you will soon see as i face not only steebo but the CT state champ and runner up on this fateful day...Oh well, on to the games.<br />
<br />
Game 1 - Ten Numb Superstar vs Some Kids CCT w/ Jabba&#146;s Prize<br />
<br />
This kid is playing CCT so i&#146;m like whatever, this deck can beat any deck based on cloud city, i&#146;ve never lost to a CC based objective.  Anyways, I get ten numb and the falcon out to bespin, and this kid doesnt deploy anything for like the first five turns. I dropped corran horn to free han, but i didnt know i had to do it during my control phase so he dropped IG and janus, i barriered janus and he battled me.  I thought he was going to smack me, but he captured corran so i was like okay.  I drop luke next to the chamber and obi wan on the other side of CC at the guest quarters... he goes and does nothing so i path obi, sorry about the mess IG, drop Melas, Leia, and Elyk Rhue, battle, Run Luke Run. and smack him to s.h.i.t.  I then spread out and drain him for like 4 while retreiving for 3 until i get my whole lost pile back and put the game away with a full win by 37 baby.<br />
2(+37)<br />
<br />
Highs: winning by a bunch, major beatdown, retrieving my lost pile<br />
Lows : he choked my ben with a 6 sayin his defense value was -1, i forgot it was ability, i havent played in a month..gay..<br />
<br />
Game2 my Bring Him Up The Anus vs. Tom Hollingworths Profit<br />
<br />
Profit is kinda gay so i&#146;m just like whatever.  He starts General Han and guess what.. i didnt even think of it until i&#146;m now writing this but he didnt tell ask me to deploy two aliens and i completely forgot that you even could.  not that i wouldve becuase this is a beatdown deck, i&#146;d rather wait on it.  So he drops chewie and frees han second turn to retreive 2 force.. yay for him right?  I get the emp and janus to the throne room so that i can use emporer&#146;s power.  I drop vader he gives me scout luke and puts me at the throne room so i can duel.  I never lost a duel this whole game.  I drop mara and IG and jabba against Han and chewie after taking some profit damage and capture chewie and smack han, he stacks a card.  I beat him so bad that game was pretty much over then, i know that i won another two battles by so much with tons of destinies but honestly it didnt matter.  This game flew and we rushed to get lunch becuase there was no lunch break so i had no time to reflect on my full win by 24.<br />
4 (+61).<br />
<br />
Highs: Winning without crossing for the first time.<br />
Lows : Winning without crossing, my diff was lower than id like<br />
<br />
Well me and steebo go to mcdonalds which is packed, it must be one of three in all of connecticut.  We are in line and we need a penny and this old couple offers us one and they become our new best friends, they are really cool and are talking about milkshakes with us and random stuff.  I think i heard the old guy sh.it his pants while we were standing there, but i wasnt about to say anything... these people were definitely our uncle owen and aunt beru for the day.<br />
<br />
We get back late and we are like sorry but every one is playing so we&#146;re like F!  I won the round so i figured i&#146;d play brentson but low and behold i had to play baroni, my good compadre, with my light deck.<br />
<br />
Game 3 Ten Numb Superstar vs. Baroni&#146;s chu&#146;s rops<br />
<br />
Great, chus rops is a machine if you havent seen it in action, flips second turn no matter what.  I decide i need to take ralltiir asap.  So first turn i play tunnel vision to pull leia ( i was holdin the falcon ) and save some force.  QMC starts slow so this was crazy, steve gets no characters which si gret but he got two sites in his hand so he was able to get another site out as well as a biker down.  I had no dudes in my hand worthy of beating up this biker for a great smacking considering my rebs deploy +2 so i get the superfalcon out, but i also got a site before that and had no force to move it to ralltir, i&#146;m retarded.  So he flips and instead of staying to Cloud City, i decide to go after zuckuss and emps shuttle with wedge in ship and a cannon.  he barriers drops xizor and janus for fodder so hs not having to lose everyone and not fufill battle order.  I shoot down the shuttle, but that means no destiny.  wedge says byebye as his total destiny is +4.  then he comes at superfalcon at bespin with bossk, boba and moves zuckuss over.  I drop an intruder missile and battle before he can put more fodder there, i his bossk and draw enough to take out zuckuss, but he draws enough in his two destiny +4 from his objective and clears out the pilots.  I lost blue squadron 5 off the top so there was no way i could mount a space battle with so little force (as he&#146;s now draining me for 10 with overseeing it personally) and just dash in my deck somwhere.  I end up losing by 22.<br />
4(+39)<br />
<br />
Highs: losing by less than id won by all day<br />
Lows : playing steebo, losing, rops sucks<br />
<br />
So i&#146;m still the number one 2-1 guy as brentson just beat the state runnner up brian hollinworth, so i end up playing brian, steve plays brentson<br />
<br />
Game 4 my BH up the Anus vs Brian Hollingworth (1832) Hidden Mains, Brentson style.<br />
<br />
Basically hollingworth is now running brentsons light deck with hidden mains using ITTL and docking bays on tatooine, only hes not putting 90 ships at the system like brentson is, and hes not playing some other good things i wont reveal about steve&#146;s deck. So he drops guys and is trying to drain me for a lot but i wont have it, so i drop IG and Fett against a task force that includes kenobi and i think mirax and corran horn.  I capture obi wan and smack the rest with my three destiny, stack a card biotch.  i take his jedi luke back to the temple to duel. i hate jedi luke cause he makes me stack three, which i wouldnt end up doing.  After he topped about 14 cards, fortify in front of IG and i drop mara and Jabba i think and i battle, wreaking havoc with my destinies and making him top deck another 17 cards.. by then the game is over and i just duel him to death not losing really any cards at all.  Putting up a full win vs. the CT runner up by 32.<br />
6(+71)<br />
<br />
Highs: kicking @ss vs. the states runner up in his state<br />
Lows : putting myself as the number 1 3-1 as baroni lost to brentson<br />
<br />
so guess who i&#146;m playing<br />
<br />
Game 5 the Anus vs. Brentsons uber mains (2000+)<br />
<br />
So a sevens deck is how baroni beat brentson last summer, with a coutner assault for 25 cards (5 sevens), so i figure i might have a shot.  This was a fun game, brentson is a good guy to play.  He sets up his jank and puts a force at tatooine, i only play a few ships and stuff, so that i can stack cards if needs be, but nothing that can take his uber force a tat.. not yet at least....really he only had dash to start off, and tried to alter my blast door controls or something and failed.. so hes got some guys at a dbay, like mirax and obi, and i drop some guys and battle and i win, that was my first battle and i&#146;m on my way to crossing the luke he already gave me and i was duelling at the throne room.  then he deployed melas and some other dudes at one of the other docking bays and i see his tawss that he had run to the home one dbay.. im holding mara and im praying he doesnt remmber her, cause i also have sim and thrawn if i really want to smack down, but he remembers and moves her with the other guys.  I try battling once more but has too many guys in space and i have not enough force saved and he wins the battle.  i&#146;ve got all three of my ships now and thrawn so i decide to take it to him with bossk only and take out some of his dudes.. which i do with my two destiny and next turn i drop executor and zuckuss and thrawn and do some battlin, he doesnt draw enough to take out the executor and he wont battle me himself with the sick destinies im getting, but he does keep draining on the ground and refortifying tat... plus im losing to my obj.  Finally the game is obviously over, with him on top but i coerce him to battle my lone executor with a few of his ships left and hes like NO im scared of you, and im like cmon steve you havent battled me all game just do it, hes like fine, knowing that i have 3 ability and only one card left so i cant use emporers power... or can i??? i sac the effect to add a seven and take out a few guys, which was funny cause he wasnt expecting it and it gave us a good laugh before i drew up and lost by 18.<br />
6 (+53)<br />
<br />
Highs: only losing by 18 to brentson, catching him off guard<br />
Lows : Losing, not winning any battles really<br />
<br />
So going into the last game, baroni is playing some kid we dont know but is pretty funny becuase he joked with me about watching out when going to the bathroom becuaes you had to walk by all the D&amp;D players, he asked me if i got raped and i was like dont worry about me i know how to cover my @#$% well.<br />
<br />
So game 6 is My QMC vs. Tom Hollingworth BHBM<br />
<br />
He came into cloud city with vader and tarkin.  I give him luke and fortify in space with ten numb superstar and han on falcon... he decides to tell me hes not coming to space, and i read the kid well and i konw hes not coming for real once he verifies my deck and sees all the uber space i have there.  its at this point i realize that i&#146;m playing with 59 cards and have been the entire day.  Anyways hes totally smakcing me around, with drains at his rebel base battle groudn docking bays.  I forgot about janus being stopped by menace fades twice and forgot to make him lose to his objective 3 times... so that sucked, but not as bad as it could have been.  Anyways i only have three sites, but no bg&#146;s so vader and tarkin are stuck there.  I lose OTE early, so i cant do the run away lose 3 thing.  I do get guys at the two sites tarkin and vader arent at but he drops Xizor and 4lom and i dont want no cancelling game text so i barrier 4lom, he decides not to battle.  We battle a few times tarkin vader vs corran wedge canceling destnies against each toher, keeping the site in check and what not.   I dodge some battles and path away some more, before i finally get in a position to battle him so i can swing before he cancels.. the one thing that got me this game was that the kid played like 129927384927 alter/colateral damage, and he took out like 6 of my guys like that.  So im celebrating now and im hurtin, i narrow escape ecc lando corran and wedge in front of vader tarkin and ponda baba/evazan combo.  vaders saber went off the top early so i wasnt worried about being operated on.  i had like 4 cards in my deck and two in my hand so i had to make this work, becuas he way more cards than me... i path obi to the site and sorry about the mess vader..draw 5....draw....3... hit! i get luke back and smack the F out of him.  I cant swing again and i miss tarkin, he colateral damages again and i lose lando.  I win the battle by alot but dont clear the site, i move corran and wedge over, and his turn he moves ponda baba to an open site, i retreive two and move luke and obi over to the pondababa site and split wedge and corran up.. i overkilled by moving both because he battled me and was power -3 suffering enough damage to kill him off with the four cards he had, giving me the come from behind victory by 7, putting me in third place.<br />
8 (+60)<br />
<br />
Highs: Winning after losing so badly - i love qmc<br />
Lows : getting smacked around when i shouldnt have <br />
<br />
So i take third, baroni second, brentson first.. baroni lost his last game against jody shields.  Brentson picked the bobafett card tshirt for his prize and got two R2 packs, me and baroni got a sense and alter foil respectively and a pack of R2 but my pack had no foil which blew. So all in all we came and conquered CT pretty well, tearing it up on the away teams turf.  <br />
<br />
The ride home was pretty uneventful aside from the 5 mile traffic backup heading the other way, me and steve measured it on the odometer and it came out to five miles exactly, and at the end this guy in a van was backing up along the highway trying to go dwon the exit ramp, he probably crashed but who knows<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
Brentson for winning<br />
Oakes for runnin it<br />
Me and steebo for 2/3 ing it<br />
everyone who went who is cool<br />
