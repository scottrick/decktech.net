Why? Because freshman writing sucks, and I refuse to apologize to any of you who are currently freshman composition students and think that you can write. Prove it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would have written this report earlier, but I was buried under a stack over one-hundred or more pages of freshman prose. Now that I&#39;ve finished grading all that garbage, though, I&#39;m free to write a tournament report about last weekend&#39;s big shindig at Twin City Comics, near Minneapolis. Due to the delay, however, I&#39;m a little fuzzy on details.<br />
<br />
Nick Kolnik hyped this tournament for roughly a month. Kyle Heuer, from Decipher, was going to be in town, at the store, on his Black Rider tour, and Nick wanted a showing of the faithful. Prize support would be huge, and then Joe Micka made it huger (yes, it gets to be a word in my report, da** it) by offering some rare foils to people who would show up that hadn&#39;t been to any other tournaments all year. In the end, we drew 26 players. I&#39;ve seen some remarks, already, about how 26 is a lot these days, but we typically draw 10 to 16 for the weekly locals. Nick&#39;s a machine.<br />
<br />
I had won a teensy-weensy tournament in Mankato the week before and didn&#39;t feel like changing my decks, so I was playing Hansicle CCT with Iggy Superstar for my Dark and Throne Room mains for my Light. I&#39;ll post that deck shortly, just as soon as I think of a clever title.<br />
<br />
Game 1: My Dark against some guy&#39;s (I forgot his name. Sorry.) Hidden Base.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have a starting effect, so I figured he&#39;d been out of the game for a while (that, and I didn&#39;t remember seeing him at any recent tournament). Also, he started only two of his three possible effects after playing Heading for the Medical Frigate as his starting interrupt. One of his effects did things with asteroid sectors, which threw me off for a while, but I knew I had this one in the bag.<br />
<br />
I just did what I was supposed to do: Fetched locations early to boost my activation, controlled the ground and fetched Search and Destroy, gathered some space into my hand, and hit him hard. He&#39;d left Biggs in Red 3 alone at a system with Special Modifications to save him from asteroid destiny.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t worry about asteroids at all. I just came at Biggs with Zuckus in MH, 4Lom and Bossk in HT. Spank. I started probing his systems since he flipped on the fourth turn. But I just couldn&#39;t find his hidden base. He spread out a bit in space and cancelled my ground drains, but once he spread out, he left himself vulnerable to a hit from Thrawn in the Executor.<br />
<br />
The overflow knocked him into the red zone, and I started worrying about differential. With 26 players and only 4 games, we were most likely going to have multiple undefeated players, and the tournament would come down to differential. Furthermore, I didn&#39;t anticipate being one of those undefeated players (after all, I was playing CCT), so I wanted some arse-kicking differential to bump me up among the 3 and 1&#39;s. Meaning, the 4 probe cards I had under his systems were holding me back. I maneuvered my space around so that if he was to battle me with his one remaining ship it would hurt him badly, and then I got the Executor to his hidden base (something at Parsec 2), probed it, effectively retrieved 5 force, plinked him with Search and Destroy, and said go.<br />
<br />
He drained me for the last force from my hand, and then I got him with drains on my next turn. FW by 38. 2(+38).<br />
<br />
High: Taking over space against Hidden Base with my 3 ships.<br />
Low: I had to probe all his systems to find his base.<br />
<br />
Garrett Larson wins his first game as the Light Side by 40. We figure we&#39;ll play each other and spend half an hour joking around while we wait for the slow players to wrap up their games. Some guy named Jentso went the full 60 minutes in each of his games that day, or so it seemed.<br />

Mike Raveling, who was coming into the tournament with 15 or 17 straight wins, won his game by 20 or so. Rumours spread that Mike had intentially lowered his differential to get a favorable pairing. I wasn&#39;t certain that was a good idea.<br />
<br />
Game 2: My Light vs. Garrett&#39;s Speeder Hate.<br />
<br />
Garrett&#39;s a friend and one of my favorite opponents because we play a similar style, mostly mains and toys, and our games are interactive, full of battles, strategic, and typically hinge on one turn or one card. That&#39;s not to say that they&#39;re typically close, at least as far as differential is concerned. Both of us play decks desgined to win by more than 20 each game, but our games are close in that if we don&#39;t stay on our toes, we get knocked on our rears.<br />
<br />
Garrett started the 5th Marker, Location x3, Power of the Hutt, and something else. I just remember thinking it was clever, but then he pulled Nick over to show Nick his hand. Either it was going to be really good or really bad. Mine was okay as I was able to pull a twix and had four decent characters in my hand, including Ben Kenobi (oh yeah!). I pulled a docking bay with Insurrection/Aim High, played my Twix and drew. Garrett dropped two Jabba&#39;s Palace sites from his hand and played another with the Jabba&#39;s Palace text. Later, I&#39;d learn that his hand sucked because it was full of red and sites, but as far as I was concerned, that was a good hand against me. It gave him force which was something he wouldn&#39;t get from me.<br />
<br />
On my turn, I dropped Ben and Corran Horn to the Audience Chamber. Ben got his Saber thanks to Sal (v), and he got a Meditation, too. I drained there for a couple turns, adding some back-up, until Garrett deployed the Emperor, Janus, and Iggy with Gun next door to the Palace.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d been holding Qui-Gon w/Saber, Screaming Man-Ho, and a Sorry About the Mess/Blaster Proficiency combo. It was time for me to strike, so I played whatever shield it was that let me grab Advantage from my deck and attacked. Unfortunately, when I swung at Palpy, despite the 20 or more 5+ destiny draws I had in my deck (of probably 40 or so cards by that point), I missed. Iggy took Man-Ho captive, and I lost Qui-Gon while Garrett lost Palpy.<br />
<br />
On his turn, he played some back-up, and I started fortifying the Audience Chamber even more securely, dropping Jedi Luke and his Saber. Boussh went undercover to stop Garrett&#39;s drain. So he had to come to me. When he did, we had another massive battle. Padme fetched Qui-Gon (another one, of course) from my reserve, and once the smoke cleared, Luke gained the Advantage. I love that card. I lost Ben and Qui-Gon and Boussh, but I cleared out Garrett&#39;s side, entirely.<br />
<br />
He tried to play a Dre Combo, late game, but Mace Windu, who hadn&#39;t made his way to the Jedi Council Chamber, dropped down and smacked the smugglers. FW by 29. 4(+67).<br />
<br />
High: A tournament game against Garrett, in which Jedi Luke gets Advantage.<br />
Low: Having to beat Garrett by 29 to keep in running for first. But, later, I wouldn&#39;t feel so bad once I heard he won his next game with his Light by 45!<br />
Ugly: Missing old Pasty.<br />
<br />
Raveling won another game in which he supposedly lowered his differential. Given that he played Walkers and Speeders, I figured his differential was going to be low enough, but he brought it down to something like 16 or 11.<br />
<br />
Peter Jacobson had played his CCT, a Scummy version, and won. Mark Peterson was apparently also playing CCT. I was amused.<br />
<br />
It had been a while since we had a tournament over 20 people, so I was amused by the masses of people thronging around Nick while he called pairings. After 2 games among 26 players, we couldn&#39;t have more than 13 undefeated, but wouldn&#39;t likely have more than 6 or 7. I worried that I&#39;d have to play Raveling or Graham Neal, both of whom can beat me at least half our games. But when Nick called pairings, I was matched against Peter Nelson and made a remark that I probably shouldn&#39;t have about &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; or something. &quot;He&#39;s standing right there,&quot; Nick said. Me feel bad. Guilt make me blush. Sorry, Peter.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, though I was happy for Peter and all, it was a match-up I knew I could win. And it was one less game I had to play against Raveling or Graham. The last tournament I played at TCC, I got paired against Raveling twice and lost both times, thus going 2-2 in a small local. Like a scrub. I think that&#39;s a Madonna song: &quot;Like a Scrub.&quot; (&quot;Losing force for the very first time. Like a scru-u-u-ub. No Houjix.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Game 3: My Throne Room vs. Peter Nelson&#39;s Hunt Down<br />
<br />
I swapped out Wokling (v) for Insight and scrapped it right away for Honor since Peter didn&#39;t start No Escape. In fact, he didn&#39;t play No Escape all game, so the only turn he didn&#39;t lose force to his Visage was the one turn he played Vader before I played a Jedi. But I digress. Peter started Location x3 (v), Bad Feeling (v) and Crush. Since I wasn&#39;t going to give him any force, his starting effects kind of stunk. He&#39;d have to use two force for either Location x3 or Bad Feeling, and he didn&#39;t have much force to start with. Meanwhile, I got the Holotable out and Boss Nass&#39;s Chambers and the Home One docking bay.<br />
<br />
I had both Qui-Gon and Ben Kenobi in my hand, but since I wasn&#39;t losing force to Visage and he was, I was just biding my time. Peter grabbed Jabba&#39;s Palace and the Audience Chamber and deployed Vader on his subsequent turn. I deployed the Tatooine DB (it should be Mos Eisley, but I was too lazy to look for it) and Ben Kenobi, flipping him back.<br />
<br />
Peter had already searched for a Circle, but I had no fear since I had Jedi&#39;s Resilience in my hand and both the Affect Mind (v) and Grabber shields on the table. Nonetheless, he pulled Deep Hatred, stacked a card on Vader and moved over to duel, playing the card that let him add a destiny. His stacked card was a 6, and his destiny were a 3 and 1, giving him (with the Saber and Vader&#39;s ability) a total of 19. I drew a 6 and a 5, added two for my Saber, another 2 for Ben&#39;s game text, 6 for my ability, and realized I didn&#39;t need Jedi&#39;s Resilience this game. I won the duel 21 to 19. The game followed shortly. FW by 35. 6(+102).<br />
<br />
High: Ben Kenobi rules this tournament. Peter and I have something like 45 minutes left in the round, so we switch sides and play another game.<br />
Low: I tell Peter to never, ever, ever, ever duel blind. (I should know after losing my share of blind duels.)<br />
Ugly: There are still at least two and a half months to Christmas. I should have known better.<br />
<br />
So, it turns out Mike Raveling had just played his Dark. And he was undefeated. And we get paired against each other. And he won this match-up by something like 26 the last time we&#39;d played. Aha, but I have changed 3 cards in my deck, so maybe I&#39;ll win. (Well, one of the cards I swapped was the Wampa Cave for the 5th Marker. I figure that&#39;ll probably help some.)<br />
<br />
Game 4: Iggy Superstar vs. Raveling&#39;s Speeders<br />
<br />
At least, heading into this game, I know a couple of Raveling&#39;s tricks. I had battled him in space in our last game, thinking that owning space might be the key to the game. I&#39;d launched Thrawn and Guri in the Executor against a fully-loaded Outrider of Dash, Corran Horn and 3PO. I, of course, got spanked. He&#39;d played A Few Maneuvers to make the Outrider a maneuver of 11 or 13 or something just crazy, reduced my power by 11, and then played Darklighter Spin before drawing his other destiny (from Haven). Dash blinks and the Executor is no more.<br />
<br />
So, on his first turn, when Mike plays his All Wings/Darklighter Spin combo, I grab it. I don&#39;t know why, but he takes the Falcon into hand. Han&#39;s still frozen, so I figure either he&#39;s got the Outrider in hand or it was in his force pile. I have two goals for Iggy: 1) Pull the 5th Marker, 2) Pull a space fleet to conquer Hoth. Again, I am convinced that ruling space will be the key to the game, but this time I plan to get to Hoth first, rather than letting him get Haven down early and deploy cheap.<br />
<br />
On my 2nd or 3rd turn, then, Iggy pulls Zuckuss, and since I have a Barrier in hand, I deploy him. I know Mike doesn&#39;t have SAC, since he played BOTH SAC shields in our last game. I also know this means: 1) He&#39;s not likely to cancel my barrier, and 2) When I want to Sense something, I will succeed.<br />
<br />
Mike gets out a couple speeders for an early flip, but I have Come Here You Big Coward in effect. I just take my Speeder damage while I drain him for as much on my turns. I keep pulling stuff for space until I can launch a good counterattack and then start readying my ground forces. Palpy goes to the Carbonite Chamber, where Iggy joins him, and Maul with Saber goes to the Audience Chamber.<br />
<br />
On his turn, Mike plays Dash on the Outrider. I Barrier the Outrider, and he grabs it. He plays Haven, R2-D2 and Mirax, thinks, takes Mirax back, then shakes his head, tries to make up his mind, and redeploys Mirax. On my turn I play Bossk in HT, 4Lom and Guri. He reduces one of my ships to power 0, but it doesn&#39;t matter. I draw 14 total destiny to his 0, and the Outrider explodes in a ball of flame that quickly expires in the vacuum of space.<br />
<br />
Mike deploys Screaming Man-Ho against the Emperor and Iggy, but I Barrier, stacking a 2nd. He contemplates sending him to his used pile, losing a force to do so, but I point out that it costs him two force. He decides to leave Lando at the Carbonite Chamber, paying his last force to keep him alive. I deploy First Strike, P-59 and Dre Combo and battle. Unfortunately I miss with P-59, but the power total is something like my 24 to his 10. I lose P-59, and he loses Lando, then plays a Houjix, except that I point out First Strike is on the table. Mike takes 7 overflow. I can&#39;t remember the last time I gave Mike overflow.<br />
<br />
So I&#39;m taking 3 Speeder damage each turn, but Mike can&#39;t drain me for anything and can&#39;t retrieve. I&#39;m draining him for 4 each turn and finally dig Search and Destroy out of my force pile. Mike deploys Qui-Gon against me, but I play a third Barrier, fetch Vader on my next turn, battle, retrieve, swing, hit, and operate. Then I realize I could have just let Mike suck up the overflow, as there probably would have been overflow, but instead, I ping him with Search and Destroy before he gets in a final 3 Speeder damage. Then I drain him out for a win by 20.<br />
<br />
Nick says, &quot;Only 20 this game?&quot; And I say that it&#39;s probably my biggest win of the day. Which it is. No offense to Garrett, but that was a new, untweaked deck, anyway. FW by 20. 8(+122).<br />
<br />
High: Overflow against Mike.<br />
Low: Not much. Just knowing that I probably would have lost if I hadn&#39;t know his Outrider tricks.<br />
Ugly (but in a good way): Averaging over 30 differential for the tournament.<br />
<br />
I end up winning the tournament, but I don&#39;t know conclusively until Joe Micka writes his tournament report as I have to rush out the door to attend the Black Rider tournament at another store. That&#39;s a different report, though, and maybe I&#39;ll write its since I won that tournament, too. (It was actually pretty darned good weekend for me and tournaments, 3 for 3, two Black Rider and one Star Wars.) Suffice it to say, I head back to Mankato late at night, in the dark, with twenty or so student essays hanging over my head. Finally I get them completed by Thursday and write this during an hour break between class and laundry.<br />
