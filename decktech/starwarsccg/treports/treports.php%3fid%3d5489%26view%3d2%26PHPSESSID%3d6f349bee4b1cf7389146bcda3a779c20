So after seeing numerous top 10 lists of players, and who people expected to contend for Worlds 2006, and not seeing my name, at all, on even lists as big as 25, that was about all the motivation I needed to get out and do some winning.  I ran Kashyyyk Regionals, (I posted a TR if you are interested in results) and upon viewing the same stale meta, I realized not much had changed since worlds, except that lightside had in fact gotten even better.  Wow.<br />
<br />
So, I put together a modified TRM list, probably 12-15 cards different than the one I used at worlds.  This one included Resilience and (V) Escape Pod, because I am never letting (V) Vaders Anger make me lose a game, again.  I built a Bespin deck with walkers and commands, it was like, average, but thats about all darkside had.  I figured to tune up for Maryland, I would go the New Jersey (V) Lite tourney.  Well I scrubbed out there, going 3-3, nearly losing all 3 games with ds, and actually dropping a game with the TRM.<br />
<br />
I was back to the drawing board for Maryland.  At Jersey, Arvind Bhaskers brother Vinay had a Bespin (V) Readiness deck using Tank Commanders and Tanks, that I was able to beat.  The concept I was very interested in though, so I built my own (its posted now if you have not seen it).  It really abused every facet of (V) Sim Aloo, and played some unexpected cards.  Somehow the deck started to leak before Maryland, so the surprise factor was not what I had hoped it would be, but thats okay.  I also had wanted to try the concept for the Broken Deck that Reid Smith had posted, the one with 5 All Wings Combos and Green Leaders and stuff.  I figured in a disoriented DS meta, this deck could cause even more serious problems for DS players.<br />
<br />
So, for the trip down to Maryland, I left Quinnipiac University at about 1:00 pm to pick up Brian Hollingworth over at UConn.  Unfortunately, UConn is an hour in the wrong direction, so this added some time to our trip.  We got back to my apartment by my school at 3:15, and we packed up some cards and went to hit the road.  We were on the highway by 3:40 so, since mapquest said the trip would be 4 hrs. 30 minutes, we expected to be in Maryland about 8:30.  The plan was to get there, call Aglets, playtest some, and get ready for the following day.  Heh.<br />
<br />
The trip was going completely as planned when we got to New York City.  Since we went to Jersey two weeks prior, we knew that Mapquest Directions to put you on the George Washington bridge, are easily misinterpreted.  So, we decided to just stay on I-95, rather than taking the exit that Mapquest said.  [Note, that exit took us to a brige (a frimbazeling SCARY bridge) into Long Island, and cost us 10 bucks in tolls two weeks prior.]  This became a nightmare, as we ended up getting lost in the Bronx.  The Bronx man, is frimbazeling sketchy.  We had kids riding up to our car on their bicycles, and thought we were going to be killed.  So we took a left towards country club lane because that sounded safe for us white people.  No, complete lies, this country club lane is a complete fallacy, and we were in like, an even more Ghetto section of the Bronx.  After 30 minutes of driving for our lives, we were on the road to the George Washington Bridge.  Traffic was so bad that it took yet another 30 minutes, to even get across the damn bridge.  Thanks a frimbazeling lot mapquest.<br />
<br />
So we get over the George Washington and celebrated being in New Jersey, about as much as anyone can ever celebrate being in New Jersey.  Something along the lines of Great, we are in frimbazeling New Jersey.  So, the directions basically said follow I-95 (the Jersey Turnpike) south for 238094872308 miles.  Straightforward right?  Just follow the mapquest direction and take the road straight?  At your own peril!!!!!  Somehow, we ended up on 80 west.  This was, frimbazeling great.  Almost as good as the bridge.  It took about a half hour to realize we hadnt seen a tollbooth, and were actually going west.  So we called Greg Shaw, and had him be our atlas {Brandon Schele is only used when looking for restaurants in ghetto Maryland &#61514;}.  Luckily we were approaching 287 south which would link us back up to the Turnpike.  You have no idea how much time this added to our trip.  Basically, if you picture a triangle, rather than taking the straight line, we took the other two sides.  This, blowed.  Aglets called us asking where we were, so our plans were pushed off a bit.<br />
<br />
We stopped and grabbed food and continued driving, for a long time.  We again drove through Delaware, in 2 minutes this year.  After last years 5 minute experience, we were a bit wiser that you should not ever stay in Delaware this long.  The old man attacked our car again, trying to get us to stay in Delaware, some revolutionary fellow.  See, no one ever actually stops in Delaware, but there is some sketchy exhaust going on down there, you want to avoid it at all costs.  Finally we got to Maryland at 10:30 at night.  Yes you got that right, the 4hr 30 minute trip, took 7hrs.<br />
<br />
We call Aglets.<br />
<br />
Me: Hey were here<br />
Aglets: Cool, drive to my house<br />
Me: I just drove 7 hrs, why dont you come here<br />
Aglets: Because me and my brother (iceskatelaceendz) are testing here<br />
Me: Ugh, how far away is it and how do I get there<br />
<br />
So, Aglets gives us directions to the high school near his house, saying it was an easy landmark and that hed meet us there in 30 minutes.  I told him wed get there in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
15 minutes later, we get there and call Aglets and tell him to hurry his wookie up.<br />
<br />
*****The Story of How I Almost Got Arrested in Maryland*****<br />
<br />
So we pull into the school parking lot.  There are two vans in the lot, with their lights shut off, but people are in them talking.  I dont know what this is called in Maryland, but up North we call it frimbazeling sketchy.  We pull in the lot, and the two vans drive away.  We are sitting there with our lights on waiting for Aglets to show up.  We see a car pulling up, thank God, Aglets is finally here.<br />
<br />
Or so we thought.  We quickly realized Aglets doesnt drive a state cruiser.  Oh frimbazel.<br />
<br />
Cop: May I ask what you are doing here<br />
Me: Yeah we are waiting to meet our friend and follow him back to his house<br />
Cop: Were you with those two vans that just drove off?<br />
Me: No, I dont know them, Im from Massachusetts, Ive never seen them before<br />
Cop: May I see your license and registration<br />
<br />
exhaust.  The cop looks at my car, and verifies that the license plate is in fact from Massachusetts.<br />
<br />
Cop: We got a report of a mysterious car, and thats why we are here, so I guess that car is you<br />
<br />
frimbazel.<br />
<br />
Cop: So what are you doing in Maryland, if youre from Massachusetts<br />
Me: We are here to play cards for the weekend with some people tomorrow.<br />
Cop: POKER?<br />
Me: No not poker, a Star Wars card game.  Heres our Mapquest Directions, thats the number of the Store.<br />
<br />
Now, Im saying its not poker, and I have a set of Poker Chips *AND* a Blackjack Dealers shoe in my backseat.  Inconvenient??  Yes.<br />
<br />
Cop: Why didnt you meet him at his house?<br />
Me: He told us the school was an easy landmark to find.<br />
Cop: Why didnt he just meet you in your hotel?<br />
Me: You can ask him that, believe me I didnt want to do any more driving after this long trip today.<br />
Cop: Seems strange that youd drive all the way down here just for a few days.<br />
<br />
Two more cruisers show up, and two more cops come out.  They say nothing to us.  Were going to die.<br />
<br />
Cop: Can you step out of the car please<br />
<br />
I step out of the car, he frisks me and Hollingworth.  He feels a cell phone in my pocket and says WHAT IS THIS.  Im like Its a cell phone.  He says Are you SURE?.   Yes officer.<br />
<br />
Cop: Youve taken something out of your pocket<br />
Me: Yeah, my wallet to give you my license.<br />
<br />
Seriously, are these cops retarded?<br />
<br />
Aglets FINALLY shows up.  15 minutes my ass.<br />
<br />
A cop walks over to Aglets to ask him what is going on.  Meanwhile I gave the cop permission to search my car, and my trunk.  They are going through all of our bags.  Oh yeah, I also had ANOTHER set of poker chips in my trunk.  The officer asks us have you had any drugs or alcohol tonight, or are in possession of any right now.  We say no.  Then I realize, I still have some Vicodin in my backpack, because I had back surgery in June.  I wasnt sure if my name or my moms name was on the prescription.  Luckily they didnt find it.  All this time, we had to sit on the curb like the delinquents on TV have to.  Finally the cop says Aglets corroborated our story, and we could go.<br />
<br />
Now the cops start trying to joke around with us, because yeah this is a riot.<br />
<br />
Cop 1: We just dont like you because you are from Massachusetts, we hate Kennedy.<br />
Me: Which one?<br />
Cops 1 2 and 3: Ted.<br />
Cop 2: Ted Kennedys limo almost ran me over in Boston.<br />
Me: Well at least HE wasnt the one driving.<br />
Cop 3: Hes only bad on bridges.<br />
<br />
So, now that Ive had possibly the most interesting and exhaustty day of my life we follow Aglets to his house.  My phone rings, its my mom at 12:00 at night.  I realize I had not told her I was going to Marylandoh exhaust what if the cops called her (the number is on my license).  I pick up the phone.<br />
<br />
Me: Hi Mom<br />
Mom: Hi, just wanted to let you know Im going to bed so dont call the house for anything<br />
<br />
Phew<br />
<br />
Me: Oh okay, no problem..Hey mom, did I tell you I was going to Maryland this weekend?<br />
Mom: ..no?<br />
Me: Oh, yeahwell Im here for a tourney, Im splitting a room with Hollingworth at the Days Inn<br />
Mom: Oh okaywell good luck.<br />
<br />
We arrive at aglets house at like 12:30.  So much for testing and getting a good amount of sleep.  Aglets and IceSkateLaceEndz hadnt even built his decks YET.  What they were doing all day I have *NO* idea.  Must have been something with shoelaces<br />
<br />
So we show up, I get the cards to try out the broken deck.  Test draws 12 times in a row, only get AWRI, the ship or the guy 3 out of 12 times.  We calculated the odds to be an 88% chance that I should get it opening hand.  Mind you this runs 5 AWRI, 2 ship, 2 guy, and 2 tunnel visions which can be used in the worst case scenario.  So I scrap the deck, and build a TRM from scratch, and this is what would lead to me finishing in the $$.  Aglets tells us that Team Ohio is not coming and that they posted it on the swccgpc boards.  I told him theyre just trying to fake people out, and Hollingworth didnt think anyone would actually waste the time posting this online to fake people out.  Turns out I was right, if you read Justins Strattons report he says:<br />
<br />
As we are driving we have the great idea of posting that we wouldnt be able to attend the event on the forums, hoping that if we showed up late, Aglets would tell people that we couldnt come and people would start to take anti-Scum cards out of their decks. Dont know if it worked or not, but we figured it was worth a shot. So Booker calls his lady and she logs in and posts for us. Goulet! (Stratton, 2006)<br />
<br />
Cool.<br />
<br />
Hollingworth tests a game, and we decide to leave and just test on our own, because this is getting nowhere, and after this long of a day, we just wanted to get to sleep.  I test TRM against Hollingworths walkers twice, and we crash for the night.<br />
<br />
We get up for the tourney the following day, I make a few last minute changes, and we head to the event.  We confirm with the front desk that well stay an additional night, because we dont want to deal with that drive home following the tourney.<br />
<br />
We show up at the event, I make decklists and realize I should probably run Demotion cancellers in the Tank deck, so I pick up two to put in.  People start showing up including Reid Smith, Steven Lewis, Brian Rippetoe, Kevin Elia, Brandon Ruck, Micah Wooten, Spencer Ball, Brandon Pahl, the rest of team Canada, Iceskatelaceendz, Team Ohio, and other people.  Greg Shaw is not in attendanceweird.<br />
<br />
We get our first round pairings<br />
<br />
Game 1 LS vs Justin The Other Guy Strattons DS Scum Pistone Style<br />
<br />
I really should have anticipated this and used The Camp.  Oh well.  I start (V) Professor, (V) Strikeforce and (V) Civil Disorder.  He Starts YCHF, (V) Jabbas Influence, Combat Response and Power of the Hutt along with his sites and stuff.  We start up, Turn 1 I play a twix and draw.  His following turn he just draws some to get some stuff set up.  My turn, I deploy (V) Obi Jedi Knight to Tatooine: Jabbas Palace, play another twix, draw some and say go.  His turn he deploys (V) precautions (which he pulled with YCHF first action), (V) Jabba The Hutt, (V) Lando, Bib Fortuna, and (V) Bane Malar.  In my hand, I have a Mace, saber, inconsequential barriers, and savrip, along with some forfeit fodder.  I deploy Mace on my turn, no barrier or nsp (V), so I deploy savrip, and battle.  No MM.  I swing at Jabba, miss (he has NO leader there).  He loses 2 to double power.  I swing at Jabba again, hit, he forgets to use DS lando.  I drew a 4 I think, I ended up making him lose both Jabba and (V) Bane Malar.  I forfeit HCF to savrip, use strikeforce (V) to get it back, thought about forfeiting it again, but forfeited an EPP qui and something else to it instead.  So, I was able to kill (V) Jabba and make him run away from the AC, sending (V) Precautions used.  I moved (V) Obi Jedi Knight in with (V) Mace and said go.  By this point, I am in the drivers seat and Stratton cannot catch up.<br />
<br />
FW 2 + 24<br />
<br />
Highs: Still being able to beat Scum<br />
Lows: Ugh there are 7 Scum decks here.  Greg Shaw has shown up late and had to get a round 1 loss.<br />
<br />
Game 2 DS (ugh) vs Steven Lewiss Tat CP (V) Nabrun Jedi Presence deck<br />
<br />
I was excited to play against Steven Lewis since I never had before, but had no idea what to expect out of the tank deck this game.  I started (V) endor shield, (V) alert my star destroyer, (V) were the bait and droid racks.  He started (V) Rycar, (V) Quick Draw, and I forget which other two effects (hence they didnt do anything really that game).  My first turn I had executor in hand, so I activated 1 pulled They Must Never Again Leave This city, then activated my other 8 force.  Deployed free effect, revealed Executor, grabbed piett, deployed both to Bespin for 2 force.  For the remaining 6 forced I deployed a tank commander and a tank to the 2/2 site along with were in attack position now which helps my immunity and causes a point of direct damage where I control a site with a tank commander.  Solid first turn, allows me to setup battle order AND (V) Firepower if he doesnt battle me.  I have a Cease Fire in hand to stop his weapon target (yes Ill lose two force for this, this early in the game).  During his turn I grabbed a tank commander with Piett, and I grabbed Chiranneu with Endor Shield (V).  He uses yoda stew to get some more generation, and pulls lightsaber proficiency with (V) rycar.  Deploys (V) Mace Windu, Saber, Proficiency to the Tosche Station, says go.  I pull (V) Firepower and stack a card on it.  My turn I deal 4 points of damage (1 at bespin, 2 at the 2/2 site, 1 from the AO).  I deploy a tank commander outside of the tank, play (V) Luke Luke on him (DUMB CARD) and target his (V) Mace Windu.  I then deploy a tank for the commander, move him into the commander (this isnt considered leaving so it works).  I draw one, save two force (I have barriers, and other interrupts in case he plays DTF) and say go.  So this looks like I am in the drivers seat.  Heh, almost as good as when I was in the drivers seat the day before on the actual trip.  He activates like 2384024382308234 force.  Deploys EPP Han to the site with (V) Mace.  I say okay, because what is Han going to do?  Apparently everything.  He deploys Mercenary Armor?? on Epp Han making him power +3 and CANCELING BARRIER!!!  He plays Nabrun Leids, and sends both guys to my 2/2 site.  Now I have 16 power, 2 destiny, immunity <4, and two tank commanders that can forfeit for a combined 10 to the droid racks, plus a cease fire to stop the swing.  I feel pretty confident I can survive this.  He then deploys Angry Chewie and battles.  Im still like, okay I can make it through this one.  His first action he plays JEDI PRESENCE????.  Now follow along, Chewie is now power 18, EPP Han 14 (the +3 from mercenary armor) and Mace is power 9 (lightsaber proficiency.  Thats power 41 to my 16 before destiny.  Holy crap.  I get two destiny, a 2 and a 3, he gets two, each plus two.  I forget his total, but he then plays yoda stew (V) to cancel attrition for both sides.  However, I still owe him like 28 force from the battle.  I lost both droids to the droid racks, and the two tanks for a total of 22, and then had SIX overflow still.  Now, the fact that I lost tanks so early, and killed NO ONE, and he has a wrecking crew draining for 4 on Cloud City, basically spells the end for me.  I deal whatever damage I can, and lose by 24.<br />
<br />
FL 0 -24<br />
Overall 2 + 0 (I could have gotten to this point with just a first round frimbazeling bye, ugh).<br />
<br />
Highs: Not much<br />
Lows: Mercenary Armor, Jedi Presence, Yoda Stew, Nabrun Leids<br />
<br />
Game 3 LS vs. Brandon Rucks RalOps<br />
<br />
I start my normal 3 effects, he starts the (V) Ralops helper effect, (V) Decree and (V) Forced Landing.  The Forced Landing helps the deck pull a card from reserve the turn it flips, generally (V) Sim Aloo so this is a pretty interesting strategy.  Anyways, he flips on his 2nd turn.  On my 3rd turn, I deploy Mace to a site of his, barrier, I grab barrier, then I deploy (V) Tantive IV and Wedge, RSL to his system.  During his turn he pulls Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and deploys it to Raltiiir.  He battles Mace, I play Smoke Screen and grab it with my own (V) Strikeforce.  The smokescreen clears him out at the site, and I take no overflow.  He then battles me in space, draws a 5 + like 3 from his sites, I lose both Tantive IV (V) and Wedge RSL.  My Turn I ditch (V) Strikeforce (sending my own Smoke Screen used) and pick my (V) Tantive IV back up, and 3po and get a HCF.  I deploy both to Raltiir, battle, activate 1, pick my Wedge, RSL back up.  He draws ozzel for destiny, so he has to lose Zuckuss and 12 overflow, I lost the falcon knowing the (V) Tantive IV was probably safe in space.  I shuttled Mace (V) up to the Tantive IV (V) anyways because I was paranoid.  Either way, I have now made a considerable blow to his deck, as he lost all his space in the overflow from that battle.  I keep a constant drain of 2 at Raltiir all game, and take over some sites, eventually flipping him back.  Hard matchup for Raltiir.<br />
<br />
FW 2 +38 (Biggest win of the day, in the entire event.  The tradition of absolute annihilation in at least one game in Maryland continues, just ask John Anderson who took 107 overflow last year.)<br />
<br />
Overall 4 + 38<br />
<br />
Highs: Tantive IV (V) and Strikeforce (V)<br />
Lows: Having to beat a good guy, Brandon Ruck.  Also forgetting (V) Obi, Jedi Knight is a PILOT now!!!  Obi pilot = HUGE!!! Screw you Maul in space!<br />
<br />
Game 4 DS vs Justin Strattons version of Reids WYS (V)<br />
<br />
Now this is a deck, I was not ready to play againstat all.  I figured I just had to keep the loss as close as I could, because I could not win.  He started (V) Entrenchment, (V) Bargaining Table and Strike Planning.  He debated whether to just start Squadron Assignments outright, but he correctly figured Id have Chiranneu and he should get rid of that drain bonus.  So basically, I dont remember too many details of this game except for a few.  One, I did not get (V) Sim aloo out for like 7 turns.  I also never got out Janus Greejatus to cycle my AO so his was never on table during his control phase.  However, what killed me was on his first turn he revealed Luke (V) and grabbed Artoo in Ship and deployed both to Corellia, and said go.  On my turn I pointed out, squadron assignments wasnt on table, so being nice we went back to his turn and replayed it.  Instead of deploying Artoo in Ship he then played LOST GRIMTAASH ON ME.  Shows what you get for being nice, and I would remember this.  I lost two tanks and two commanders because of this, slowing me down immensely.  I was able to stack a card on firepower which helped.  On one turn, I barriered his (V) Boshek at Corellia, knowing he was planning on moving a crew to Bespin.  This let me get a free move to Corellia with Executor.  In retrospect I should have stood up and battled at the system, to get more points of occupation damage through, but oh well.  Either way, during his following turn he did some stuff but most notably was resolving (V) Flash of Insight, and then trying to move (V) Boshek in Pulsar Skate over to Bespin.  Since he had passed on his move phase, I enforced this, because I knew it was more or less one of my only chances of staying in this game, plus I had been a nice guy earlier, and it had cost me.  After dealing my drains, and playing command to add a battle destiny, I was able to overflow (V) Boshek and Pulsar Skate for 6 more force (not great but good).  Either way, he had more damage going than me and pulled out a win by 4.  I would also like to pull out, that I really made no mistakes this game, but Stratton admitted himself that he made many.  Id like to provide this evidence as an indictment of WYS (V) that even with amazing amounts of mistakes, it can still win.  Mistakes included, forgetting (V) Luke retrieval multiple times, forgetting (V) Padme damage multiple times, missing the BoShek (V) move, playing as if squadron assignments was out turn 1, not drawing a destiny to attrition only with (V) Leebo, never using (V) Leebo to deal damage peeking, and not playing (V) weapons display and stacking ever.  And those were just the mistakes that I had observed.  The PC really needs to bite the bullet and redo this card, or SEVERELY errata it.<br />
<br />
FL 0 -3<br />
Overall 4 + 35<br />
<br />
Highs: Only losing by 4<br />
Lows: WYS (V), frimbazeling Lost Grimtaash because I was nice<br />
<br />
I needed some big wins, fast.  I was the top 4-2 last year in Maryland and got 5th, so I wasnt sure 4-2 with good diff would be good enough for top 4 this year (there were 26 the year prior, 30 this year) but I figured Id try my best.<br />
<br />
Game 5 DS vs. Brandon Pahls LS Combat<br />
<br />
YES.  The single most best matchup for tanks.  Ever.  Basically this game went with me setting up executor turn 1, piett, and a tank with a guy.  His turn involved getting LSJK to naboo.  My turn went luke luke (V), tank, guy, go.  He then realized he needed to deal with Luke Luke (V) and spent multiple turns sending guys at me but (V) cease fire, and self destruct mechanism kept me going strong all game.  I got out Janus, I got out (V) Sim and was really cycling my important interrupts all game.  He FINALLY killed my luke luke because I didnt have a cease fire one turn, but by that point the damage was done.<br />
<br />
FW 2 +21<br />
Overall 6 +56<br />
<br />
I was the 2nd highest 3-2, with Booker having about 70 diff.  I knew I had to win my last game, by a substantial margin, but might be able to make top 4 if I was the top 4-2.  <br />
<br />
Highs: I WON WITH DS!!!  Brandon Pahl is definitely a cool dude.<br />
Lows: I still have a lot of work to do.<br />
<br />
Game 6 LS vs. Micah Wootens RalOps<br />
<br />
NICE.  I believe this was the exact same list that I beat that Ruck used game 3.  This time I knew obi was a pilot, and knew to get (V) Tantive IV at all costs, and to make him flip back, and Id get the win.  I also knew Micah was 4-1 with lousy diff, and if I beat him, Id eliminate one of the potential 5-1 players who could have finished above me.  I also knew I could get decent diff.  Booker was playing against Elia.  If Elia wins, and I win by big diff I SHOULD be in.  This game was really similar to game 3, except that he did end up getting executor to bespin pretty mid-late game.  However I found my (V) Tantive IV by turn 4, and took over the Raltiir system, after that all I needed to do was take ONE raltiir site to cause him to flip back.  Smoke Screen helped this cause, along with not using that many rebels, because the +2 deploy bonus doesnt affect Mace, (V) Obi, (V) Padme for example.  Either way, I flipped him back pretty fast, and he would never flip again, once flipped back I took control of the game.<br />
<br />
FW 2 +23<br />
Overall 8 +79<br />
<br />
Highs: I was the highest 4-2.<br />
Lows: None<br />
<br />
So, the games wrapped up, Team Ohio started celebrating that Stratton and Team Captain Reid Smith came in 1st and 2nd, and hung up a net, and proceeded to cut it down like in the NCAA tourney.  After seeing this, I went up to Booker and said So you guys brought a basketball net with you?, and Booker said yah, so I responded with an enthusiastic .COOL.<br />
<br />
The top 4 turned out to be Reid Smith 6-0, Justin Stratton 5-1, Me with the best diff for a 4-2, and Steven Lewis in 4th at 4-2.<br />
<br />
Since I would be playing Stratton we worked out a cash split.  In exchange for giving him the day 2 of world bye for getting top 2, I wanted a healthy cash split.  Thus follows the Napkin Contract.<br />
<br />
The Napkin Contract:<br />
<br />
The deal was330 to first, 60 to second, 30 to 3rd and 30 to 4th.  Stratton and I were guaranteed at least 90.  Lewis forced a match against Reid for their bye, so our split was made during their games.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:  He gets 2nd, I keep 4th money:  I would get 60, he would get 30, out of respect for me letting him take the day 2 bye.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: 1st place and Stratton split their combined 1st/2nd place money.  390/2 = 195 each.  1st would keep their 195, Strattons 195 would be combined with my 30 and resplit between us 110 for me, 115 for him.<br />
<br />
Scenario 3: Stratton gets 1st, we split his 330 and my 30 and each walk home with 180.<br />
<br />
These splits were written down on a napkin, signed by both of us, thus completing the Napkin contract.  The consideration on my end was giving up the Day 2 bye, and his consideration was giving me more of a split.<br />
<br />
Well, Steven Lewis beat Reid in the match play 2nd game, and split 1st and 2nd place money with Stratton.  So, Scenario 2 it is, I walk home with $110 without having to play any games in the top 4.  If I had felt more confident with my DS deck, or had a better one, and was less tired, Stratton and I probably would have played, however at this point, I was sick of cards and wanted to relax.<br />
<br />
So I make some deals, trade some cards, sell some cards, buy a Japanese Premiere Vader (huge!) and pick up some Destroyer Droids against the Canadians.  I also tested a game with my TRM against the BHBM by James Sowden.  He wanted some practice, so we played two beatdown decks against each other, but I won because of a card that starts with K and ends in essel.  Enjoyable game though.<br />
<br />
After the tourney, Steven Lewis, Micah Wooten, Rippetoe, Ruck, Elia, Reish, Hollingworth and I all headed to Dennys for amazing foodthere we met the brawlwarlharhlalrhalha monster who was the hostess, and damn right nasty.  We talk about how much this game sucks for a while, and some of the antics we saw at the tourney.  Elia discussed how he saw Booker cheating multiple times, so players everywhere, keep your eyes out for that.<br />
<br />
Elia and Reish crash on the floor at the Days Inn where Hollingworth and I are staying, so we play some Poker.  I ended up making 30 bucks from this which was pretty cool.  We get up early the following morning to head back to CT, because I had to work at 3:00 tutoring.  The drive back was thankfully rather uneventful.<br />
Props:<br />
Tim for putting the event on.<br />
Hollingworth for testing and coming down.<br />
My opponents for great games.<br />
Stratton for being pretty classy, and working out the split.<br />
The guy who sold me the Japanese Vader.<br />
The guy who owns the store for putting the event on.<br />
Elia, Shaw, Dansbury, Rippetoe, Reisch for being cool.<br />
Team Canada for being real chill dudes, and talking to me about Canadian health care.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Maryland Police Department, why dont you go arrest people who are actually committing crimes.<br />
Team Ohio for the whole basketball thing.  You guys always complain that no one takes you seriously, well its because of stuff like that.  The way you guys were acting during Lewiss match against Reid was also pretty ridiculous.  If you cant respect other players, the store, you really shouldnt expect anyone to respect you.<br />
Dennys<br />
Brawlwarlharhlalrhalha hostess<br />
PC for making some really bad cards, refusing to bite the bullet and fix stuff<br />
<br />
Alright everyone, take it easy.<br />
