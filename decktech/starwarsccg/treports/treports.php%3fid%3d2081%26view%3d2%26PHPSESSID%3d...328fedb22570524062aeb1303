And,<br />
like so many other Americans, Friday rolled around and I still <br />
hadn&#146;t finished them.  So I&#146;m thinking I can&#146;t go to the tourney<br />
on Saturday, but I really want to.  So I decide to stay up all night<br />
Friday and finished the dang taxes.  Well, I get pissed off after<br />
doing my federal taxes cuz it turns out I OWE money rather than get<br />
a refund!  So I&#146;m mad.  *Really* mad.  But I finish my state taxes<br />
and its all good there.  Anyways, that&#146;s probably just boring most<br />
of you, but that explains why I will be so freakin&#146; tired for the<br />
tourney.<br />
<br />
So in staying up all night I clean up my little apartment and look<br />
over my decks.  The Hunt Down deck looks good, waaay better than my<br />
Scum deck so I&#146;ll use that one.  It uses unique Saber and Onix TIEs<br />
starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Combat Response.  Mara, Emp, and, of<br />
course, Vader are the main ground weapons.  SFS is the only <br />
retrieval.  And yes, it duels.<br />
<br />
For Light I made a new HB mains but I liked my EBO deck (already on<br />
Decktech with a few changes), so I decide to stick with EBO.  When <br />
a deck is on a streak, you just don&#146;t switch decks.  Its just Rogue<br />
speeders and xwings.  It does either ANSB start, or 3 effect start.<br />
<br />
So I head out to the train station and sleep like a log on the way<br />
to Pleasanton (I live in San Francisco), and just for kicks I bring<br />
my YJ sample deck (where all the cards have 0 or 1 damage, heheh).<br />
I get there 45 minutes before the tourney starts, do some trades &amp;<br />
play like 20 games of YJ with the sample deck against various <br />
people (the games are *that* fast with the sample deck).  I don&#146;t <br />
play YJ normally, but sometimes the sample deck can be fun.<br />
<br />
Nick Stefanko is the TD, &amp; 17 people showed to play.  On to the <br />
games.  This will be 6 games.<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS v Steven Howard&#146;s Profit (only starts Squassin)<br />
<br />
I start Mara in the Chamber, back her up with Vader 1st turn.  He<br />
draws.  I drop Emp to the Chamber, move Mara w/saber to JP for the<br />
drain of 3.  He would lose to Visage all game, so it made this<br />
game quick.  I got Kashyyk out, put the Exec there with the Emp&#146;s<br />
Sword.  Now he&#146;s eating some big drains, so he drops Protector<br />
Chewie and Capt. Yutani to JP, then draws.  Mara battles, but <br />
misses Chewie (I forgot he has armor, otherwise I would&#146;ve swung<br />
at Yutani), and I draw a 1, so I lose 2 force, he loses Yutani.  <br />
Then he deploys a Medium Repeating Cannon, and draws.  I inform <br />
him he needs a power source to shoot that, something he didn&#146;t<br />
know.  So Mara battles, and I draw high killing Chewie plus a few<br />
force and the Cannon (forfeits for 1).<br />
<br />
He came at my Exec when he dropped a YT freighter w/Kin Kian <br />
aboard.  Then he put Quad Laser Cannons aboard.  He looked for <br />
Red 3 w/Squassin, but it wasn&#146;t there.  He had lost several pilots<br />
and ships to drains and Visage.  So he battles w/the lone ship,<br />
Power Pivots Exec, and shoots the Emp&#146;s Sword.  He says he misses,<br />
but I inform him Kian adds 2 to desiny, so he hits the Emp&#146;s Sword.<br />
But he doesn&#146;t get destiny, so I&#146;m power 8 to his 3, so he loses<br />
both Kian and the ship, I lose the Sword.  I drop Endor and Saber 2<br />
w/pilot to retrive my lost force, and a few drains later end the<br />
game uneventfully.  Win by 38.  2 (+38).<br />
<br />
Best: Not letting him flip and me staying flipped all game.<br />
Worst: Mara missing the swing on Chewie and drawing a 1.<br />
<br />
After that game I realize I&#146;m not tired at all.  Good, cuz being<br />
tired is something I don&#146;t need.  I just play some YJ sample deck<br />
games in between all my games (most of them finish quickly).<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS v Kyle Ishimaru&#146;s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, Opp Enforcement)<br />
<br />
Kyle and I have a friendly little rivalry going.  Apparantly he<br />
really wants a Masterful Move foil.  And last tourney he lost to<br />
me and it cost him the 1st place, he wound up in 2nd place.<br />
I do the ANSB start.  He gets Janus and Emp at Endor DB 1st turn, <br />
but I get Battle Plan out 1st turn to slow him down.  Lord Vader<br />
goes to Endor DB, Emp and Janus move to his other DB (Tat DB I <br />
think).  He also Twi&#146;leked for Search &amp; Destroy.  I get EBO going<br />
on my 2nd turn using BHBM to deploy Hoth Luke for 2 force, but he<br />
barriered him so he was stuck under the Hoth Shield.  I drop Rebel<br />
Fleet, drop 2 xwings to Rendili, then lose 3 to Your Destiny.  He <br />
deploys Zuckuss to Rendili, I barrier, so he deploys Bossk and <br />
battles.  I have Incom on table, &amp; I play Org Attack.  Bossk dies,<br />
and Zuckuss is alone.  I play Org Attack to get 3 xwings, then beat<br />
on Zuckuss for him plus 6 more.  Oh yeah, i deployed Honor as well.<br />
But I don&#146;t have enough to move Luke to Endor DB, so I lose 1 to <br />
Your Destiny.  He draws some.<br />
<br />
I just spread my xwings out at various systems to maximize drains.<br />
Since I draw up Rogue 1, I decide to move Wedge and Luke over to<br />
the North Ridge rather than pay 10 to transit to Endor DB.   But <br />
Luke has to outside the speeder or I still lose to Your Destiny,<br />
and he has No Escape out now.  So I move them, and he brings it<br />
with IG88 against Luke and Wedge, and deploys Dengar in ship and a<br />
Dreadnaught against 2 of my xwings (one of which is Lat Damaged).<br />
So I stack a card from each battle and he captures Luke with IG, I<br />
lose Wedge, and I lose both xwings.  He loses the Dreadnaught &amp; <br />
lands Dengar w/IG88 at the North Ridge.  So he has no one at <br />
systems, I have no one at sites.  So we both must pay for drains.<br />
Although i drain for more than he does, I don&#146;t have the force to <br />
pay for them all and I lose to Search and Destroy more than any<br />
other card.  Lose by 8.  2 (+30).<br />
<br />
Best: Beatdown on Zuckuss.<br />
Worst: Beatdown on Wedge, not being able to have Luke pilot Rogue 1.<br />
And Search and Destroy was a real pain.  Normally that card doesn&#146;t<br />
hurt me.<br />
<br />
So Kyle got his wish, and I realize I need to get high differential<br />
wins and make sure no one goes undefeated.<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS v Tim Green&#146;s ROps (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br />
<br />
I do the ANSB start.  He deploys Arnet to DSII DB, I Signal for my<br />
Rebel Fleet &amp; deploy Sullust.  He deploys Vader to his Forest, I <br />
deploy an xwing to Sullust and move it to Ralltiir, saving a force.<br />
He drops Fett in Slave 1, I barrier, but he also deploys an ATST <br />
pilot to his Swamp and moves Arnet to his generic DB to flip.  I<br />
get EBO out on my next turn, and proceed to beatdown Fett with 3 <br />
xwings and an Org Attack.  He draws high (his objective helps too)<br />
but he still loses Fett and 2-3 more force.  I also deployed Battle<br />
Plan.  So he pays 3 to drain, I cancel w/Rebel Fleet, so he pays 3<br />
to drain me for 1.  I like that, paying 6 for a 1 drain.  He <br />
deploys Ice Plains w/a Tempest Scout and Chirneau there.  I have yet<br />
to draw a Rogue speeder, so I&#146;m afraid of him getting Decree going.<br />
But he just draws.<br />
<br />
So I deploy Boushh to the swamp, break cover and kill the lone ATST<br />
pilot plus 2-3 more force (I battle for free, something he forgot).<br />
And he flips back.  Now I spread my xwings to his Wakeelmui, and my<br />
Hoth, Sullust, and Kiffex.  He doesn&#146;t pay to drain and kills an <br />
xwing w/IG in ship at Kiffex.  I drain for 13, he draws.  I move<br />
Hobbie and Luke to his generic DB, and move Wedge to my North Ridge<br />
to drain for 1 (I *still* have no speeders!).  He drops Igar in <br />
Tempest 1 to Boushh, I lose her and she barely covers the damage.  <br />
He also deployed Zuckuss to Ralltiir (which I barriered), so he was<br />
about to flip when I informed him that Luke and Hobbie were at his DB<br />
so he only controlled 2 sites.  He moves the Tempest Scout to my<br />
Hoth DB and Chirneau to my MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain him for<br />
all but 1 force, then he draws his last force up.  Win by 29.<br />
4 (+59).<br />
<br />
Best: Keeping him on the zero side for most of the game.<br />
Worst: IG in ship for killing my xwing, but at least it didn&#146;t<br />
satisfy Battle Plan.<br />
<br />
Game 4: DS v Chris Green&#146;s HB mains (Insurr, Squassin, Strike Plan)<br />
<br />
Chris and Kyle are both from Lodi, and Chris wants to beat me too.<br />
So the &#146;whole Lodi crew&#146; is after me.  Oh well, who cares anyway.  :)<br />
I have Endor DB in my hand, but I know he plays it as well and I <br />
want to convert his DB.  But he doesn&#146;t deploy it, so that&#146;s fine <br />
with me cuz I only play it as a BG site for Vader.  He deploys <br />
Endor (which is in my hand, but I don&#146;t convert it just yet).  I<br />
end up losing Endor to Visage.  I don&#146;t get my Vader out until <br />
my 3rd turn, and he&#146;s just been drawing.  So I&#146;ve got Piett and <br />
Merrejk at my Exec DB and Lord Vader at his CC DB.  Its the only <br />
BG site on table.<br />
<br />
He drops Lando w/Ax to Merrejk and Piett, and I smell a beatdown.<br />
To my surprise, he deploys EPP Obi!  HD is flipped of course, so<br />
Obi can&#146;t battle, so I wait until he initiates battle and then<br />
inform him he can&#146;t battle me.  *whew*, I was saved.  I drop Emp<br />
and Mara to CC DB and move Merrejk and Piett there (Obi can&#146;t <br />
drain).  He now searches for a DB (Home One &amp; Endor DB are still<br />
in there) but he activated both!  So he deploys Jedi Luke to CC DB<br />
and moves Obi and Lando to the Med Chamber.  Well, I battle of<br />
course &amp; miss both swings on Luke, then draw low destiny.  I lose<br />
Merrejk and he loses 13 force rather than lose Luke.  Wtf?  I<br />
guess he just wanted to give up, whatever.  He activates all but<br />
one force and before he gets to his control phase to drain me I<br />
duel Luke w/Vader.  I know I&#146;ve got 2 3&#146;s on top, so if he draws<br />
a 5, we tie.  A 6 wins the duel for him.  He draws a 4 and rather<br />
than cross Luke he loses 18 force and that&#146;s game.  Win by 22.<br />
6 (+81).<br />
<br />
Best: Everything, just a good game for me.<br />
Worst: Seemed like he gave up after he made the mistake of <br />
deploying Obi to battle Piett.<br />
<br />
Well, I&#146;m ahead in differential, but I need more victory points. <br />
There is only 1 undefeated player now, John Monroe.  So, like<br />
last tourney, I play John in Game 5.  I only pray I&#146;m dark side.<br />
<br />
Game 5: DS v John Monroe&#146;s WYS (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br />
<br />
We always pair up towards the end of tourneys.  I get DLOTS to<br />
Tat DB 1st turn, he plays TT cancelling Visage.  He puts Tallon<br />
Karrade to Home One DB, saves 1.  I drop Mara w/saber to Tallon,<br />
he barriers.  I deploy Emp to Cantina.  Looks good for me so far.<br />
He pulls Falcon using Capt Solo, deploys them to Tat DB, moves<br />
Tallon aboard and takes off to the system.  I drain for 5, play<br />
Piett and Dominator to Kashyyk.  He drains me for 1, moves <br />
Falcon to Dominator, draws.  I drop Saber 4 w/pilot and a SFS<br />
cannon, but I didn&#146;t feel confident I could hit a maneuver 6 ship,<br />
so I saved 3 and let him go.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I <br />
deployed Secret Plans and SSPFT 1st turn.  Yup, it was a good <br />
starting hand.  SFS and Wakeelmui were also on table, along with<br />
the Endor DB.  So I was activating 18, he was activating 9.<br />
<br />
He dropped Jedi Luke w/saber to DLOTS (he doesn&#146;t get to flip<br />
though), battles, I Weapon Lev the saber, miss the choke on Luke,<br />
and draw low.  Luke Smoke Screens for a 6.  Vader dies, and he<br />
moves the Falcon to Tatooine, with me forgetting to make him pay <br />
+2 force to do so.  Had I remembered that, I could&#146;ve beat the <br />
Falcon down next turn.  So I deploy Lord Vader w/Saber to Luke, <br />
hit him and draw low battle destiny again so I lose 2 force.<br />
WYS is *still* on the zero side and like 20 cards are already<br />
in his lost pile.  Dominator follows the Falcon to Tatooine.<br />
He runs away, and after draining for 8, I drop the Executor, Emp&#146;s<br />
Sword, Emp&#146;s Shield (retrieving 6), and move the Dominator over to<br />
back them up (I&#146;ll Take The Leader was on table so I didn&#146;t battle).<br />
<br />
He thinks for a loooong time (as only John can, j/k John *lol*),<br />
and deploys Chewie w/gun and Theron Nett to Lord Vader to finally <br />
flip WYS.  He battles, Vader hits Chewie, Chewie misses, and we <br />
are both cleared, so WYS flips back to zero side.  He also had<br />
deployed Wedge in Red Squadron 1 to back up the Falcon.  On my <br />
turn, I deploy DLOTS to Tat DB, then battle at Kashyyk, missing the<br />
shot on the Falcon but clearing all but Capt Han and the Falcon.<br />
I had deployed Onix 1 w/ Jendon aboard, so I lost Jendon &amp; sent<br />
Onix 1 to used pile.  He backs up the Falcon by deploying Melas<br />
aboard the Skate (Mirax wasn&#146;t in his reserve).  I drain (those <br />
drains at the Cantina and Home One DB have been hurtin&#146; him), <br />
then clear him in space by shooting down the Skate.  I lose Saber 4<br />
and the pilot, then move the Executor and Emp&#146;s Sword to Tatooine.<br />
He draws and my drains end the game.  Win by 30.  8 (+111).<br />
<br />
Best: Only letting WYS flip for a single phase of a turn.<br />
Worst: Drawing low in my battles vs. Jedi Luke.  Visage getting<br />
cancelled sucked too.  I didn&#146;t draw much, so i never got another<br />
one.<br />
<br />
Now no one is undefeated and I am waaaay ahead in differential.<br />
Kyle is around 8 (+60) and he&#146;s in 2nd, so if I win the next game,<br />
no matter the differential, I win.  Kyle should be my next opponent,<br />
but we already did my LS v his DS.  So I play John again.  John is at<br />
8 (+29).<br />
<br />
Game 6: LS v John Monroe&#146;s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br />
<br />
We played this matchup last weekend with me getting a timed win by 17<br />
only because of 2 less cards than John in my lost pile.  So I was<br />
worried, to say the least.  I ask him why he doesn&#146;t start SSPFT <br />
(since it was a huge card for him last weekend), but he just says<br />
he needs those other 3 effects out for sure.  Personally, I&#146;d start<br />
SSPFT over Decree if I knew I would be playing against an xwing <br />
swarm deck.  Especially since he didn&#146;t even use Decree last weekend<br />
(against me anyways).<br />
<br />
So I start ANSB, he gets Piett w/imp Command to the Exec DB, gets<br />
Executor w/Mob Pts (the REAL Executor he calls it, not the &#146;one that<br />
got blown up in the movie&#146; as he calls it).  I Signal for Yarna, he <br />
pulls Merrejk, drops him with Piett and pulls Fondor.  I deploy EBO<br />
my 2nd turn, deploy Rogue 2, move Zev in, and move Luke to War Room.<br />
He drops Executor w/Chirneau to Fondor, deploys Yavin IV.  I drop an<br />
xwing to Executor.  I deploy Sullust and Kiffex.  I move my xwing from<br />
Hoth DB to Hoth, move Luke into Rogue 2 and move Rogue 2 to North <br />
Ridge.  He drops Thrawn &amp; Chimaera to Hoth, battles, and I Hyper <br />
Escape to Coruscant.  Executor battles my lone xwing, I play Houjix.<br />
I drain for 4, deploy a bunch of xwings at all systems except Hoth &amp;<br />
Fondor, deploy Menace Fades, and draw into Rogue 1 &amp; 3.  He deploys<br />
Devastator &amp; 2 ORS, I Hyper Escape away.  This game made me realize<br />
I need to play Order To Engage in this deck.<br />
<br />
Now I deploy Rebel Fleet, and he&#146;s eating some big drains.  So he<br />
drops a Blizzard Walker to North Ridge w/Ozzel aboard.  Then he moves <br />
Devastator to Hoth and shuttles both ORS into the ATAT.  The ATAT <br />
moves to the MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain, drop Rogue 3 w/Wedge<br />
against the ATAT, drop Rogue 1 w/Hobbie to the Ridge.  He&#146;s lost SSPFT<br />
off the top to drains, so I&#146;m *very* happy about that.  I check my<br />
reserve and see 2 5&#146;s in there, so I drop 2 xwings vs. the Avenger &amp;<br />
Chirneau and play Org Attack (Incom Corp on table).  Chirneau dies.<br />
Then Wedge battles, he draws a 3, I draw 5, but I add 1 to it w/<br />
Heading for Medical Frigate and we tie on power.  He loses Ozzel.<br />
Luke gets in Rogue 1 and I move it to Echo DB to prevent Decree next<br />
turn.  He has We&#146;re in Attack Position Now on table as well.<br />
<br />
He deploys Blizzard 2 to the Ridge w/Motti and ORS aboard.  Then he<br />
moves the non-unique ATAT to Echo DB, &amp; the 2 ORS walk into the War<br />
Room, so Decree is satisfied again (he controlled Hoth system w/<br />
Thrawn in Chimaera &amp; Devastator).  I drain (he is getting rather low)<br />
and deploy Boushh to kill an ORS at the War Room.  I also battle<br />
the lone Avenger, and smash it for 17 damage.  He loses Avenger plus<br />
8 more.  Now he&#146;s down to 8-9 life force.  He moves the ORS over to<br />
the Echo Corridor, cancelling Incom Corp but doesn&#146;t satisfy<br />
Decree cuz I moved several xwings to Hoth.  So he battles, but its moot<br />
cuz my drains next turn finish him.  This game almost times out.<br />
Win by 15.  10 (+126).<br />
<br />
Best: Not having to deal w/SSPFT, that card is what made it sooo close<br />
last weekend.<br />
Worst: None really, I always drew good destiny and didn&#146;t make any<br />
mistakes.<br />
<br />
Why is it my last game always goes to time or is about to go to time?<br />
Kyle wins his game by 30, so he&#146;s around 80 or 90 differential, &amp;<br />
once again he gets 2nd place, despite beating me.  Nick&#146;s got some<br />
real good prize support (lots of R2 packs plus a few ECC packs he got<br />
and opened up to distribute the CC packs and fixed cards).  I get a <br />
Masterful Move foil, no packs.  Thanks for reading and Happy<br />
Easter everyone.<br />
<br />
Props to:<br />
Nick Stefanko for lots of good prizes and no ruling screw-ups.<br />
Andrew Meewis for the ride back to the train station.<br />
Kyle for beating me in a good game.<br />
John for always giving me some good games.<br />
John for being the only one to beat Kyle.   :)<br />
Everyone who read this, and enjoyed it.<br />

<br />
Slops to:<br />
Chris Green for giving up against me, just play it out man!<br />
Steve Daniel for losing by 30 to Kyle!  What&#146;s up w/that?<br />
Alex Stefanko for scrubbing out.<br />
The U.S. Government for not giving me a tax refund this year.<br />
The Oakland A&#146;s, they should have a better record than what they<br />
have now.  They better get their act together. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=2081&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
