Its been a long off-season, and Team Ohio and ReidTech Inc.s cooperative agreement was approved by ReidTechs stock holders at their last meeting, in December 05, which meant that we would continue to work together in our efforts to dominate all events of 2006, just as we had done in 2005.  It is an exciting time to be a member of Team Ohio, and lucky for you the reader, we are going to share some of our experiences with you in this here report.  <br />
<br />
Off-Season Moves:  <br />
<br />
Well, in December, there was a crazy release of Virtual Set 11, which we werent really sure what to do with.  It looked like lightside got some more excellent tools to continue its domination, with the addition of Padme (v) and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (v) (who for some absurd reason can cancel Lightsaber Combat destiny draws).  Its not like, darkside got nothing; after all they got Endor Shield (v), which was a great helper for random ability 2 imperials that no one really ever plays.  Ok, I kid a little.  Endor Shield (v) is a pretty good card, but any SWCCG fan has to admit that when Darksides best card is Endor Shield (v), and Lightsides best card is Padme (v), its pretty obvious that one of the two sides got more help then the other.<br />
<br />
Not that there arent other good cards.  Luke, Luuuuke (v) / Lets Keep a Little Optimisim (v) is a lovely mechanic that the PC decided to introduce to help promote turtling, and the versatile Strike Force (v) / Something Special Planned For Them (v) has created a wide variety of nasty side strategies to use, including grabbing your own lost interrupts to abuse, grabbing your own used interrupt to make it immune to opponents grabber, or losing Strike Force (v) to pick up Home One, so you can Mantellian Savrip it twice in the same turn!  <br />
<br />
Then there is the Establish Control (v), which will someday reveal itself to be a pretty big problem, probably sometime after Darkside has a viable solution to Obi-Wan Kenobi (v), Mace Windu (v), and Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) so it can actually play HDADTJ and maybe, just maybe, keep jedi off the table for more than 2 turns.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
Somewhere amongst this V-Set that was released to super help the lightside, the PC decided to errata/clarify no less then 5 cards that were integral pieces to Team Ohios Scum and Villainy deck.  But hey, its no problem right, after all, Darkside would get some monster help in V-Set 11, right?  Oh yeah.<br />
<br />
But I digress, the point of this report is to tell the Team Ohio fans out there how we did at the Yavin IV regional, and since it was my turn to shine at this event (remember, Im the one member of Team Ohio who didnt make day 3, so this is a vindication of sorts), I figured I would step up and share my experience.<br />
<br />
Tourney Preparation:<br />
<br />
Okay, so Reid Smith is commuting up to Ravenna, Ohio for periodic play testing sessions.  We continue to throw just about everything we can come up with against Lightsides big three  Endor Mains, TRM, and WYS (v), not to mention a couple other decks that we are keeping quiet on for now, because frankly its tough enough to plan for this meta without us adding more fuel to the fire.  We try Drew Scott style HDADTJ with moderate success.  We try some crazy SYCFA speed FWKTIL decks (which would prove helpful for the Yavin IV event because there was a few of these monsters running around).  We continue to work with Scum post the erratas and it seems to stand up to most decks.  Hell man, some of us even tried TTO, CCT Dueling, Walkers, and various Combat Readiness (v) decks with Walkers, Tanks, and Sim Aloo (v) (not in the same deck, mind you!)  <br />
<br />
But nothing really seems to reveal itself to be solid.  Everything we come up with has a weakness against one of the big three.  Endor Mains can outclass HDADTJ.  Scum loses to a well played WYS (v).  FWKTIL decks struggles against Endor and WYS (v).  Combat Readiness (v) decks show weaknesses to TRM.  Its getting quite frustrating to come up with any deck.  In the end we all decide that maybe we can get away with no one else playing WYS (v), and go with Scum for just one more event.  The speed FWKTIL deck is also considered (seeing as no one outside our group really seems to be using much Endor), but we decide that we dont want to play a gimmick deck at the top tables.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
Lightside, we are pretty split down the middle.  Half of us love the flexibility of Endor Mains and the awesome might of Thats One (v).  Others like WYS (v) for its ability to really beat just about anything with a little luck drawing into twixes for the HDADTJ match up.  No one liked TRM though, as weve been having trouble finding a new balance with it and it appears to be quite opening draw dependent.  But then there are the dark horse decks.  Hidden Base, WHAP, MBO (ok, just kidding, MBO sucks a fat one), Speeders.  So many fricken options for LS.<br />
<br />
So, even the night before, most of us really dont know what to do for Lightside (too many options!), but it becomes apparant that all 7 of us are going to play Tatooine Scum and Villainy (2 of us playing a beats version, 5 of us playing a more fortress setup version), and 4 of us playing WYS (v) and 3 of us playing Endor Mains.<br />

Okay, so we have like 6 hours to drive to get to the big event, and you know that with Team Ohio there are going to be some comedy.  We stop at the first rest area in PA (about 1 hour into the drive) because I have a bladder the size of one of Spencer Balls condoms (extra small  just kidding tough guy), and Brad, Booker, and Meeker play the PA instant lottery.  I opt not to, because first of all the lottery is like a tax for stupid people who cant determine odds, and secondly why support PA senior citizans?  Well, the joke is on me because Booker wins a dollar (breaks even), and Nate Autoplay Meeker wins $10.00!  But then they cant cash em anywhere at the plaza!  So, the joke is off me and back on them!  Goulet!<br />
<br />
For some reason, Autoplay was wearing Bookers Grandmothers Sunglasses.  That alone is kinda strange, but add to the fact that they were sports sunglasses from 1982 and would look too big on Andre the Giant, it was very comical.  Autoplay wears them all day, but in the evening at dinner, begins to suspect that they may be prescription.  Booker calls his grandmother to ask her if they are prescription, because they are pwning Nate.  Bookers grandmother probably prays for Booker every day because she has no clue what the hell he is talking about half the time. <br />
<br />
We ask Booker about our new uniforms, because he is like Alfred Pennyworth and is responsible for dressing us.  He turns up a big fat nada and says No problem, its like Batman Forever.  Im like, what the frimbazel does that mean?  And he says, well at the beginning of Batman Forever he wore the old uniform, eventually having to retire it and wear a new uniform half way through the movie.  I ask if our new uniforms will have fake nipples and he said that would be a good idea.  Even if they dont have fake nipples, I plan to staple pepperonis on my shirt so mine will have fake nipples.<br />
<br />
As we are driving we have the great idea of posting that we wouldnt be able to attend the event on the forums, hoping that if we showed up late, Aglets would tell people that we couldnt come and people would start to take anti-Scum cards out of their decks.  Dont know if it worked or not, but we figured it was worth a shot.  So Booker calls his lady and she logs in and posts for us.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
We get to the longhorn steakhouse, still just the 4 of us because Reid is stranded in Pittsburgh waiting for people to actually get to the rendevous so they can leave.  So, at the steakhouse Autoplay and Booker decide to pound some beers.  Now, autoplay is an experienced veteran, and booker just got his pubes sometime last week, so it really is no contest.  Me, being the grizzled 28, decide against participating in this contest of wills.  Booker orders the steak, and it turns out that it is the suck.  Very fatty.  He complains that there is a lot of grizzle on his steak, he must have gotten the Grizzley Adam cut.  The manager pwns us all by asking whos driving.  Now, if none of you have had the fine experience of dining we me, you would know that I am a very light eater.  Like, dinner salad fills me up, light.  But Im thinking of taking the plunge and getting a burger.  Brad Eier orders, and orders a meat free dinner, because its lent!  Im like, damn, Im not <br />
Catholic, but Rachael is and we have an unspoken agreement for me not to eat meat on Fridays during lent.   So, I switch it up to a plain dinner salad.  Get dressing that I dont really care for, and lose the game as I only eat maybe 60% of the salad.<br />
<br />
Finally, on the way back to the hotel, Booker wants to stop at Wal-Mart so we can buy a basketball net that we can hang up and cut down when one of us make the top 4.  Well, Booker and Brad have to drop a deuce in the bathroom at Wal-Mart, and it like takes forever.  I go in, and Booker proudly points at the restroom cleaning schedule which now says l33t pwnage! on it.  Im guessing it was a pretty nasty deuce.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
We get back to the hotel, finally meet up with Reid and his 2 buddies, Dan Tortellini and Pat My Johnson.  We crash the lobby as we begin to play test the hell out of Scum vs. WYS (v) and Scum vs. Endor Mains.  I run with Walkers for a little while because we figured Shaw would be playing walkers and no matter what, we did not want to get Shaw Shanked two years in a row!<br />
<br />
I go to bed at about 2:30 A.M., skipping out on the Dennys traditional brownie.  As we are scrambling for our last few deck tweaks, and borrowing cards from each other, Reid Smith hands out a black marker so we can all scratch out Kevin Brownell on our Combat Readiness (v) and Careful Planning (v) virtual slips.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Big Day:<br />
<br />
I wake up at about 5:30 A.M., mind racing for 2 hours about my deck choices, and then finally get up at 7:30 A.M. and tweak a card or two in my WYS (v).  Im starting to have big doubts about WYS (v) because I wasnt sure if I would see very many empy powers, and I have little experience with it (never played it at an event before, only playing it testing, and you all know how that is, with constant reset buttons and stuff).  So, I fill out two decklists!  WYS (v) and WHAP!  I have more experience with WHAP, and have a soft spot for it.  But I decide against it after my team mates tell me that would be a totally n00b thing to do.  So, I stick with WYS (v).  Goulet!<br />
<br />
We get to the event almost last minute and turn in our stuff.  Wait for pairings, and Im the second name called me vs. Pistone!<br />
<br />
Again, my decks:  WYS (v), a few cards shy of Reid Smiths.  Tatooine CR (v) with Scum and Villainy.<br />
<br />
Game 1:  My DS vs. Pistones TRM<br />
<br />
Never played Pistone before, but we occasionally talk tech on AIM, and he seems friendly enough.  I know he can get frustrated with Team Ohio hi-jinks, but he seems to leave that at home when we see each other at big events.  <br />
<br />
So, he starts Civil Disorder (v), The Professor (v), and Strike Force (v).  No Camp.  And no Insurrection combo.  So, I like that.  My opening hand is pretty sucky, no evasion.  His first turn, he activates and drops jedi council chamber and says go.  My first turn, I activate, check for a site, dont see one key character that I want, so draw a few and say go.  His next turn, drops Obi-Wan Jedi Knight (v) at Jabbas Palace.  My turn, I drop Jabba the Hutt (v), Bib Fortuna, Lando (v), and Bane Malar.  I have no evasion, and its not exactly the best combo of dudes, but Im thinking 30+ power should keep him away.  His turn he drops Mace and stick from hand, and SAVRIP.  No canceler in my hand, so my 30+ power isnt going to much to scare him away.  He battles, I have no leaders, so he swings at Jabba, misses.  Swings again draws a 5, hits him.  I tap him, and a few seconds pass with no actions as he is thinking about what to do, and I ask, is it too late to use lando so you get a miss on that swing.  He says its sorta late for that, and since there was no actions Im thinking well, technically I could do it, but agree that ethically its probably wrong.  So, I let him hit him.  He draws a low destiny so I lose Bane and Jabba.  He tosses HCF for savrip, tosses Savrip to get em back, drops Quiggy for savrip, and covers the damage.  My turn, I run away and put Maul on Infiltrator at the system.  Opt not to cloak because I got to verify his deck and saw some ships there so figured Maul would be alright.  He continues to harass me on the ground with random EPPS, knocking me off the sites.  Losing Jabba early was painful because I lost my once per game jabbas influence.  I was never really able to put together the combo of characters that I needed to keep Pistone in check, and in the end I lose the game by 24.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
(0 / -24)<br />
Good:  TRM without the Camp and Insurrection should be manageable<br />
Bad:  Somehow I blow it<br />
Ugly:  Forgetting Lando at that key moment, probably a game costing mistake, because next turn Im pretty sure I kill both his guys.<br />
<br />
Game 2:  My LS versus Nate &quot;Autoplay&quot; Meekers Scum and Villainy.<br />
<br />
God damn it!  Already matched up against a team mate!  Seems kinda odd, because Im at -24, and he is at -4, so Im amazed that we got matched up.  But, anyhow, if Im going to have to play a teammate, Im happy that its with the favorable WYS (v) vs. Scum.  Now, Nate and I were pretty silly this game, and I really cannot recall to many details.  Ultimately its me setting up at Corellia, him setting up at Tatooine getting ready to Elis Beat me.  He drops Dengar with Gun after having Dr. E and Ponda Boba there, and I barrier dengar, so Im not sure if I delayed the inevitable beat or not.  I grimtassh him and see that he has like all his space.  But he and I both know it will do him little good unless I do something n00bish like leave Pulsar Skate and BoShek alone at a system.  So, I spread out to tatooine (sending Red5 and Luke and Red Squad 1 and Wedge, and maybe something else) and correlia, holding the Tantive IV (v) in hand for reacting at correlia.  I really want to put it at tatooine, but know that I will need to shuttle dudes off correlia assuming he gets the elis beat put together.  He eventually drops Maul in infiltrator to tatooine with the occupation and begins cloaking.  And he elis beats, but I get lucky and he misses with dengar once, and random correlian soak deals with it.  The grimtaash told  me that he only had the one Elis, so on my turn, Im able to move my remaining ground dudes to the jungle.  Eventually, my l33t objective gets me the game winner, X-Wing Laser Cannons and Sorry about the mess.  Blast Maul away in the control phase (no Gela Yeens), and cancel occupation.  Nate has to play for Battle Plan now.  And I sent Obi Wan  / corran horn to pound on some dudes at Jabbas Palace.  So, I should be able to maintain a battleground site, and win the game.  I think he draws up.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
FW + 15<br />
(2 / -9)<br />
<br />
Good:  XWing Cannons and Mess before opponent gets Gela Yeens.  I make a mental note that if Im on the other side of this matchup later today, Jabbas Influence (v) is reserved for Gela Yeens<br />
Bad:  Grimtaash AFTER the drain was the suck because Nate tossed his doubles to the drain.<br />
Ugly:  Padme (v) is pretty good or something.  I didnt mention her, but she was out there causing 2 direct damage a turn.<br />
<br />
Game 3:  My DS vs. Ron Fosters WYS (v)<br />
<br />
I dont know Ron at all, never seen him on the boards or anything, and hes pretty quiet.  He flashes WYS (v) and I think:  Okay, this is either very bad, or very good.  As he is shuffling I accidentally see Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight (careful while you shuffle kiddos), so now Im thinking This is going to be good, because I like Luke JK as much as the next guy, but not in WYS (v), so Im thinking that Ron might have a weaker WYS (v).  <br />
<br />
I cannot remember what he starts exactly, I think Strike Planning, Rycar (v), and maybe inconsequential losses (v)?<br />
<br />
My first turn, I setup Jabba and the two tuskens and Ephant Mon just for measure (after all, I saw Luke JK, who knows what other mains he may have in his deck).  The tuskens are pretty sweet.  His first turn, he drops Laudica, Crix, and Bruckman to the Farm to flip (his other location was docking bay).  My turn, I drop Security Precautions (v) on the docking bay, Capture Fett and Capture IG-88.  Capture Crix, send him to used pile. Capture Bruckman, send him to used pile.  Beat up on Laudica.  He houjixs.  But he is flipped back.  And thats pretty much how the game went.  I never really lost that strangle hold on his site, had the game in complete control.  Setup Maul in infiltrator, Gailad, occupation, even got a limited resources in on him.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
FW 2 + 28?<br />
(4 / +19)<br />
<br />
Good:  Win with Darkside<br />
Bad:  Sorry Ron, it was a rough one for you.<br />
Ugly:  Not very many character removal options in my Scum nowadays, but I draw both of em in my opening hand.<br />
<br />
Game 4: <br />
<br />
My LS vs. Mike Pistones Bespin AAT Tanks<br />
<br />
First, I just want to say that I really played this game like a total n00b.  He starts Were the Bait (v), Alert my std (v), Endor shield (v), and Droid Racks with downtown plaza, some other 2/1 site, and the system.  I debate starting Get To Your Ships over Entrenchment, thinking drain bonuses wont be a problem, then remember Cheerio and opt to start it.  He takes his first turn, sets up Executor.  I take my first turn, and flash Luke to get Artoo in Red 5.  His next turn, hes like hey, where is your matching ship puller!  And Im like ugh, Im a n00b.  And Mike could have just called the judge over and got me disqualified right then and there.  But he did the nicest thing, he let us rollback the clock to my turn and let me play it differently.  So, Im like thanks dude, you are the best.  So this time, instead of playing Luke, I opt to lost grimtaash him (I had a hunch).  Boom, I get 2 droids and 2 tanks.  Booya.  I then pass it to him, he drains and draws.  My turn I flip with 4 correlians altogether.  His turn, he finally gets Sim Aloo down and sets up a tank at the other site and occupation.  My turn, I get Luke and Wedge on their respective ships and Boshek on Pulsar Skate and move wedge, dash, luke to bespin, leaving BoShek.  His turn, he drains, and relocates to Correlia with executor.  My turn, I play flash of insight.  Deploy Padme on outrider and Leia at the swamp.  Resolve Flash.  Realize that I forgot to move Boshek!  I go to do it, but Mike is like no way dude, you skipped phases.  So, Im like uh-oh.  Pistone beats on me pretty nasty, but I only lose 6 overflow.  He teleports tanks over now and then, but without the cannons they dont stand much of a chance against correlian soak.  I win by 4  Goulet!<br />
<br />
FW 2 + 4?<br />
(6 / +23)<br />
<br />
Good:  I did play like a n00b this game, but did pull off one sweet move.  I had to get a 6 into position to draw it for battle destiny, and the only 6 I had was my extra copy of No Questions Asked (v).  So I use my objective on his turn, putting it into my force pile.   I  bust out Dont Do That Again, so I could search my reserve deck.  I had to spend 2 force to do so, allowing me to put my 6 into the used pile so I could track it for a battle destiny.  Sim Aloo (v) FTW!<br />
Bad:  I played this game terrible.  First the luke thing.  Then forgetting to run away thing.  I forgot to retrieve with Luke bunches of times.  I forgot to cause direct damage with Padme (v) bunches of times.  I forgot to setup Weapons Display the one turn I could have.<br />
Ugly:  Pistone being a nice guy letting me go back to my first turn, and then I blind grimtaash him on a hunch and probably cost him the game.<br />
<br />
Game 5:  My LS vs. Steven Yeagers SYCFA Speed Fear.<br />
<br />
Steve starts YCHF combo, Dreaded Fleet (v), and I think Endor Shield (v).  I start the standard Bargaining table (v),  entrenchment (v) [cheerio!], and strike planning (v).<br />
<br />
His first turn is sorta slow, he gets some systems out and doesnt deploy.  My turn, I flip with random correlians and setup Luke at the system on Red 5.  His next turn, he puts out 3 star destroyers, and sets up 2 at kiffex and 1 at Rendili (I think).  My turn, I drop Mirax and Leia with Blaster on Pulsar Skate to kiffex.  Barrier.  I move Luke and Dash to rendili.  His turn, I think Im about to lose the game.  Lat damage on pulsar skate.  3 destroyers (barrier handled one, and he grabbed it) altogether.  But I only lose like 5 to the spillover.  I dont forfeit the skate so he has to keep lat damage on the table.  He doesnt have enough force to move away the destroyer from luke and dash.  So, my turn, I return the beat, and get out the GG card, legendary starfighter. After that, I was able to steadily block his drains with dash and luke, and eventually get other dudes setup here and there.  No undercover spies ever came to correlia, but Corran Horn was waiting.  Sidious hit the docking bay, but I tracked escape pod to pwn him with obi w/ stick.   Goulet!<br />
<br />
FW 2 + 8?<br />
(8 / +31)<br />
<br />
Good:  Playing this matchup a bunch of times on our own was pretty useful<br />
Bad:  I cant believe I didnt try to re-inforce Leia, Mirax, and Skate, totally overestimated their value.<br />
Ugly:  I dont think Steve had much luck drawing into the cards he needed.<br />
<br />
Game 6:  My DS vs. Steven Yeagers Hidden Base Corvettes a.k.a. Justins revenge on Alden Petersons proxy.<br />
<br />
For those that probably dont know, I lost big to Alden Peterson in the first game of Worlds Day 2.  I took S&D out of my scum deck the night before, and sure enough see a stupid LS deck that doesnt go to the ground in the very first game.  Choke on Gela Yeens and Sorry about the mess combo = game over.<br />
<br />
But, unfortunately for Steven, I vowed never to lose in this matchup again, and I came after him with a furious vengeance.  Pretty simple game really for scum.  Dude at AC, dude at lower passages, evasion in hand, search and destroy on table, equals FAST damage.  His first turn he just drops a bunch of systems, and sets up 2 corvettes.  My next turn, I get Gailad out with JI (v), and move Jabba to palace.  Lost Monnok him before drains causing 5 cards lost.  His turn, he has no ships because of the monnok, but gets the last system he needs to flip.  My turn, I drain for 2 because he canceled the other two, and draw for cards, wanting to setup Maul, Gela (in my hand), and infiltrator with Occupation.  I do get a Bane Malar (v) and say Oh, thats a good card.  His turn, he drains, plays Padme (v).  My turn, Bane to table, drain for 2.  Luke Luuuke (v) on Padme(v) piloting corvette.  His turn, drain.  My turn, drain for 4.  His reserve deck is looking very small now.  I still have not come across Maul or his ship, but realize I dont even need to go to space because Luke Luuukke (v) is pretty homo.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
FW 2 + 14?<br />
(10 / +45)<br />
<br />
Good:  Stewing on this matchup a bunch of times was pretty useful<br />
Bad:  Nothing really, this game was pretty easy, and would have been easy last year had I actually kept S&D!!!111!!!111!!!!one!!!!11eleventy11111!<br />
Ugly:  What can Steve do in this matchup?  Search and Destroy is a princess.  I ask Steve to sign it, thinking Im going to have everyone that I beat with this card sign the same copy.<br />
<br />
Results:  Im the only 5-1, and Reid is 6-0, so hes first, Im second.  Pistone was 4-2 with huge diff for 3rd, and Steven Lewis clawed his way to top 4.  <br />
<br />
Team Ohio and ReidTech Inc. cut down the nets with independent consultant Pat My Johnson, and our new adopted ward Dan Tortellini also cutting down pieces of the net.  <br />
<br />
None of us want to play a final confrontation, but no one wanted to give up a bye either.  So, Steve demands to play with Reid in order to fight for the bye.  Pistone and I negotiate a cash settlement so I can get the bye.  Hell get $60.00, Ill get $30.00, but I want the bye and figure if I have to play in day 1 to get it, itll cost me $30.00 anyway, so gimme. <br />
<br />
Reid pwns on Steven Lewis with WYS (v) against SYCFA Fear.  Lat Damage made it close, but Reid wins by 9.  Tantive IV (v) is good.  Then Steve wants the second match to be an isolated event.  Not sure why, maybe he cant play in front of a crowd. Or, he mistakes Reid Smiths uncanny ability to predict the cards in your hand as being someone tipping his hand to him.  Anyhow, Steve was playing a Tatooine CP (v) deck, and Reid is a little worried about a bounce.  But from what I can tell, Steve didnt do it.  I dont know the details of this game because no observers were allowed.  Im thinking that Nabrun Leids probably won the game for Steve, but not sure.  Steve wins by 21.  Goulet!<br />
<br />
With Steve and me now in 1 and 2, and he has his bye, hes willing to do a 2 way split.  So, I get $195 dollars, as does he.  Then, Pistone and I had already discussed this scenario, so he gets $115, and I get $120.<br />
<br />
We drive home, with a lot less energy.  We get to Ravenna at 6:00 A.M. (daylight savings FTL).  I crash out pretty much the entire next day.  Get to hug my baby daughter, Rebecca, who must have grown about 18 inches since I last saw her on Friday morning.  And no, her first words are not HOMO, you frimbazelers.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.  If anyone is a hater and rates this report low, Ill be sad.  And I didn&#39;t proof this because its 9 frimbazeling pages.  So, be nice.<br />
