place to put it in this report!) So I finally get to bring a buddy of<br />
mine, Levi Buck. He&#146;s played StarWars for awhile, but he stopped a<br />
couple years ago and has never been to a tournament before. We struggled<br />
to build a DS deck a couple weeks ago, and he called me and told me he<br />
wanted LS asteriods, so I build him a simple awing sanctuary deck. I&#146;ve<br />
been wanting to build an awing asteriod deck anyway, so I figure I&#146;ll<br />
let him test it out for me. We finish the LS deck at my house and eat<br />
our pizza, then head over to Shaner&#146;s Outer Rim. Don&#146;t get confused;<br />
it&#146;s the OTHER pink building behind the Whataburger! It&#146;s nice to have a<br />
tournament 5 minutes away instead of a half hour drive. I decide to<br />
change my DS from PalpyOps to a Hunt Down w/ duelling and MAD tracking,<br />
and my LS is a HB fake Mains + Toys with MAD tracking. I&#146;ve been working<br />
on my tracking since I keep miscounting by 1! I need to get better at<br />
that. I have to get Levi back by 11:30, and the games start at 7:00. So<br />
when 7:30 passes by, I&#146;m getting worried. We finally start, and I&#146;m<br />
paired with Robert Seymour, a guy I&#146;ve never played before, but that I<br />
know. Here we go.<br />
<br />
GAME 1: HD vs. Robert&#146;s Tatooine Operatives<br />
<br />
That&#146;s right, he starts the Operative objective with Tatooine. I don&#146;t<br />
know, either. I have no idea what to expect and no clue what effect to<br />
start with. I think I finally wound up with Battle Order, but I don&#146;t<br />
remember. He was kind enough to give me my 6th Force for my first turn,<br />
so Darth Vader visits the DS Docking Bay. He drops EPP Luke, so Vader<br />
needs to take a trip. I pick him up and prepare to drop EPP Vader next<br />
turn instead because I want that boy sliced into little tiny pieces. He<br />
drops EPP Leia and EPP Han, so now I know what the deck is. I drop the<br />
lone EPP Vader anyway and initiate a battle. I play You Are Beaten on<br />
Leia (when Luke&#146;s gone, she can&#146;t drain although Han can). TO NO AVAIL!<br />
Did you know Weapon Lev cancels You Are Beaten? Neither did I. So I<br />
settle for hitting Luke and losing 12 Force. This is what kills me; I<br />
could normally come back with that loss, but I LOSE LORD VADER AND CHOKE<br />
VADER AND DARTH VADER TO THE LOSS!!!!! Yes, that&#146;s 4 Vaders (including<br />
EPP) in one battle. Yeah, that killed me more than anything else. So I&#146;m<br />
holding onto my last Darth Vader (I KNEW I should have put a 6th Vader<br />
in the deck!) knowing that HE CAN&#146;T DIE!!!!! I drop Fett against the<br />
Spiral and Nien Nunb with a 6 tracked, but he barriers Fett. I have 5<br />
Force left and Zuckuss. DRAT! My little army chased Ben around Tatooine,<br />
but I never catch up to him due to the way he placed his sites and<br />
docking bays. He drops Harc Sef with Ben to cancel my drains DRAT! for a<br />
couple turns. Visage eventually does me in. This was a fun, very<br />
interactive game despite the outcome.<br />
<br />
FL by 6<br />
0 (-6)<br />
<br />
PROS: Lots of interaction, good tracking by me, killed Luke at no<br />
expense<br />
CONS: Um, let&#146;s see... how about 4 VADERS!!!!! Playing Tatooine Ops,<br />
losing YAB, Fett getting barriered with a perfect 6, Harc Sef.<br />
<br />
So that was frustrating. I lost to a TatOps deck. I ran out of Vaders in<br />
the first couple turns. I&#146;m ready to avenge myself with my LS mains and<br />
toys deck. But here&#146;s the catch: I have to play Jared. Maybe I&#146;ll wait<br />
until next game to avenge my loss...<br />
<br />
GAME 2: HB vs. Jared&#146;s Bring Him Before Me<br />
<br />
Okay, my starting hand has Luke JK, EPP Luke, EPP Leia, DoS, and some<br />
other scout. I don&#146;t remember who. For the rest of the game, I would<br />
draw no other characters besides Luke and Chewie. I search for Dagobah<br />
first turn; Dagobah is activated. I settle for Endor with Strike<br />
Planning blocking his generation and draw Dagobah. I drop it next turn<br />
and search for Yoda&#146;s Hutt; Yoda&#146;s Hutt is activated. He Twileks for<br />
Search And Destroy, but it never hits the table when he realizes I&#146;m not<br />
playing space. I gave Vader my JK Luke from the deck because I didn&#146;t<br />
have enough Force to do it from my hand. He didn&#146;t drain on the Tat DB,<br />
which was too bad because I had a Lost In The Wilderness with his name<br />
on it. I took out his non-stop onslaught of Walker Fodder, but I died so<br />
often it wasn&#146;t even funny. He caught my first Insertion Planning,<br />
making it impossible for me to track my 6 destinies. He eventually<br />
stacked 7 cards on his Luke turner, but he won every single duel, making<br />
it impossible for him to turn my Jedi. I finally got down to Cracken and<br />
EPP Obi in my hand, but I didn&#146;t have the Force left to do some carnage<br />
in the Throne Room. I can&#146;t lose the duels anymore and he turns Luke<br />
with 3 cards left in my deck.<br />
<br />
FL by 17<br />
0 (-23)<br />
<br />
PROS: Um, maybe, um, well, ahh, um... is it getting hot in here?<br />
CONS: No tracking, drawing crappy destinies to boot, only drawing luke<br />
and chewie, not getting Vader lost, not leaving 2 Force for Insertion<br />
Planning<br />
<br />
Yeah, that was ugly. But Jared&#146;s a good player, and I can still make a<br />
decent showing, right? Well? Am I right? Okay, don&#146;t answer that. I know<br />
I&#146;m scrubbing now. Levi won his second game, so I&#146;m happy for him, that<br />
evil bum. He wants to play a fun game while everyone else is having<br />
pizza, so I break out a DS2 precon and start a game. He freezes Jendon<br />
first turn for a loss of 8 (Honor should be in precons!), and I&#146;m<br />
satisfied to stay on Endor and drain. Anyway, our game gets cut short as<br />
the next round begins.<br />
<br />
GAME 3: HB vs. Stephen&#146;s Tatooine &quot;Sands Of Giants&quot; scenario<br />
<br />
He didn&#146;t have time to build a real DS deck, so he was using the deck<br />
from Scot&#146;s tourney long ago. I tried to remember the deck I had built<br />
for the event, but I couldn&#146;t remember the specifics. I was just<br />
watching out for jawas and tuskens. Luke JK and DoS ran around Tatooine,<br />
avoiding his army. He had a G-Stick, and I can&#146;t use my weapons! I must<br />
find a way to get around this little error in strategy I seem to have<br />
made. Anyway, I&#146;ve got Chewie of Kashyyyk and Gen Solo at the Endor DB<br />
for an easy drain of 1, a destiny draw, and the ability to cancel one.<br />
He drops Lord Vader and Tarkin, and we battle away. He cancels my battle<br />
destiny, and I use Insertion Planning on him to track a 6. He draws a 3,<br />
so I don&#146;t bother to cancel it. I lose a Force, and we all live. Next<br />
turn wipes him inside out. You see, the previous turn I had just drawn<br />
up Draw Their Fire and Frozen Assets. I was planning on having fun with<br />
some assault-less troopers, but this was just too much fun to let pass.<br />
I drop EPP Obi, Tawss, and Wedge to Endor, Clash Vader, Draw some Fire<br />
and Freeze his assets. I initiate a battle (forget to retrieve Clash!),<br />
swing at Tarkin, and draw the infamous 6 (tracked) for destiny. I even<br />
called it. So he loses Tarkin and 22 more. The Grand Moff leaves some<br />
blood stains on Vader&#146;s jacket as he watches from afar, but there is<br />
nothing he can do. He can&#146;t even Ghhhk because of Draw Their Fire and<br />
Frozen Assets.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a couple Skywalkers are still bouncing around Tatooine. I<br />
finally get a weapon lev and ask Jared for a specific ruling on reacts<br />
and just and who gets first action and all that to make sure I do this<br />
right. Lord Vader paid a visit after being beaten off Endor, so he&#146;s<br />
here, too. I battle, he reacts, and I weapon lev his G-Stick. That&#146;s<br />
nice. And I even remembered to retrieve one this time. I get to use my<br />
sabers! I slice a couple guys, knowing that I don&#146;t have the numbers to<br />
kill the Dark Lord. I lose DoS, and he loses his hit guys plus a cadet<br />
to cancel the rest of it. DRAT! We ran around the planet a little more,<br />
then we battled again. I was trying to wear him down with the drain of 1<br />
on Endor, but it wasn&#146;t working. I realized that my top destinies were<br />
good, but I didn&#146;t know what my third was. I destroy Vader and rip him<br />
limb from limb over and over again, celebrating the evil joy I got from<br />
it (I drew a destiny of 12 for the saber hit). He draws a destiny, and I<br />
draw a 4. I lose Luke and Houjix the rest, he loses Vader and some other<br />
scrub. So I&#146;ve played solidly, made no mistakes I can think of, and used<br />
my strategy and tracking skills to the max. Now I realize that I have 6<br />
cards left, and he has a drain of 6 coming up. What happened? Before I<br />
activate my last turn, I search for a general. Lando isn&#146;t there, but<br />
I&#146;ve got 2 Obi Kenobi&#146;s. I activate it all, drain him for 1, and draw,<br />
hoping I can get something useful. In retrospect, I could have used the<br />
Spiral to react to his drain, but it wouldn&#146;t have mattered. He still<br />
would have killed me with the other drains. It really puzzles me how I<br />
lost this game. I played great, then I just kinda ran out of cards. The<br />
very last card I lost was ironically my last 6.<br />
<br />
FL by 7<br />
0 (-30)<br />
<br />
PROS: Tracking like a mad mother *shut your mouth!* the entire game. I<br />
had the 6 lined up every time I needed it. I&#146;m finally getting better at<br />
this. Someone even commented after I had drawn my 6 for battle destiny<br />
the 7th or 8th time in a row &quot;That guy&#146;s a tracking madman!&quot; I felt good<br />
about that one. Royally raping Tarkin, using my cool Draw Their<br />
Fire/Frozen Assets tech that I learned from the Mega Tourney Saturday<br />
night. Stealing a Gaffi Stick. Using Transmission Terminated to cancel<br />
the Monnok that wanted to eat my 2 Jedi Lukes. Did I mention the Tarkin<br />
battle already?<br />
<br />
CONS: Still managing to lose somehow. I think my mistake was dropping<br />
everyone at Endor and not being able to get them off the planet.<br />
<br />
So that really pisses me off. I was doing great, then I just ran out of<br />
cards. Yeah, it sucks. Whatever. So now I get the bye because I suck so<br />
badly. I watch Levi&#146;s last game. He&#146;s playing his Asteroid Sanc against<br />
someone&#146;s Hunt Down. I played my Hunt Down against his Sanc deck before<br />
we came, and he slaughtered me by nearly 30 points. Sanc really takes a<br />
toll, even if it&#146;s just at 1 system! He manages to destroy his opponent<br />
through a few mistakes, but at the end of the game, asteroids take out<br />
the Avenger, Fett, Zuckuss, and Bossk all in one stroke. Sanc at 3<br />
systems for 4 Force each + drains at the Big Ones + Rebel Fleet +<br />
Undercover Spies = Levi won. So he won both LS games. And he&#146;s never<br />
been to a tournament before. For crying out loud, he only saw the deck<br />
for the first time a couple hours ago! He&#146;s only played it twice, both<br />
against me and my playing style! He came up 4(-40), not bad at all! I<br />
ended with 2(-30) for a 2nd to last place. Levi finished 4th to last,<br />
and Brian Choongphol went undefeated and won the thing. I pull a Liberty<br />
in my prize support, thank the maker that it&#146;s not a TTO, and give it to<br />
Levi. I should have played with the asteroids and given him my HD deck.<br />
I scrubbed out hard. I don&#146;t really know why I&#146;m playing so poorly<br />
lately. I&#146;ve got decent decks, I&#146;m just not doing something right. I was<br />
&quot;borrowing&quot; a modified version of Brian Hunter&#146;s HD deck today, just to<br />
see what other variations on the objective are doing. I&#146;m gonna steal<br />
some other deck ideas while I&#146;m at it just to find another little nitche<br />
that I can call my own. I&#146;ve got ewoks for LS, but I need something for<br />
DS now that PalpyOps is all but retired.<br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
Shaner for holding a tourney a couple minutes from my house!<br />
Shaner for giving unheard of prices on SWCCG stuff. I can&#146;t post it<br />
online, but email me privately if you&#146;re interested in the best prices<br />
in town.<br />
Everyone who came for making it a fun, sanctioned event. Even though I<br />
scrubbed, it was still fun.<br />
Levi for coming and doing incredibly well at his first event.<br />
Me for finally tracking without any mis-counts<br />
<br />
The Bad and The Ugly:<br />
Shaner for having 18 million Outer Rim Scouts that span the entire floor<br />
length of his store. :-P<br />
Jared for catching my tracked 6 destiny card!<br />
Levi for beating me in rankings.<br />
Everyone else who beat me in rankings! ;-)<br />
Me for losing without the aid of mistakes<br />
Me for not having money to spend on product. I used my lunch money for<br />
next week just for the entry fee! Yes, StarWars IS more important than<br />
eating.<br />
<br />
It was a good event, thanks to all who came. See you next time! YJ on<br />
Sat, and Type2 on Sunday, I believe. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=1445&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
