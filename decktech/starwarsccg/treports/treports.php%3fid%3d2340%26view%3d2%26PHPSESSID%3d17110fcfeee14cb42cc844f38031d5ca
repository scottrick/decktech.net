Or as we call it in Jersey, &amp;#8220;Please God, just let anybody win but Scott&amp;#8221;.  Personally, I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to go.  A) Cedar Grove is a really far drive, and the shop with the kick-@ss chicken sandwiches is closed on Sundays.  B) I&amp;#8217;m a scrub, so I don&amp;#8217;t really expect to pull off the upset.  Especially since I&amp;#8217;ll still be playing decks my loopy-@ss built, while everybody else will undoubtedly have monsters they pulled off Decktech.  But hey, I haven&amp;#8217;t hung out with Daulton and 3CG lately, and it was Regional Champion John Lolli&amp;#8217;s quasi-return to playing.  Can&amp;#8217;t miss that.  So after playing beach volleyball for eight hours on Saturday, I get up at 7am dead-tired, grab my decks, and start the trek.  Why NJ States is in the topmost corner of New Jersey instead of somewhere a little more centrally located is beyond me, but I gave up trying to figure out Decipher years ago.  If they really wanted to make it the longest possible drive, they should have had it in Cape May.<br />
<br />
So we get there a little later than expected (we had to stop at Burger King to get some crowns) and end up scrambling to write our decklists in illegible chicken-scratch.  Like I said, I wasn&amp;#8217;t originally going to go so I&amp;#8217;m playing the same decks I&amp;#8217;ve been playing for weeks.  Light-side is a WYS deck we&amp;#8217;ve always just called &amp;#8220;The Pile&amp;#8221;.  There&amp;#8217;s nothing good in it.  No Palace Raiders/Patrol Crafts, no Sunsdown, no Kessel Runs, literally, it&amp;#8217;s just a pile.  But it wins about 85-90% of it&amp;#8217;s games, which is pretty good for a scrub like me.  Dark Side was Court, but it was really half of two decks I just threw together.  So it was like a bizarre cross-breed between CotVG, HdaDtJ, and a three-legged donkey.<br />
<br />
28 people showed up, and probably 15 of them were townies, two-pointers, random.players, newbies, etc.  I figured everybody would get a charity game or two, then the tournament would separate and the good players would actually have to start working for it.  Turns out, most of the scrubs up there were half-decent.  They each took two of this month&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Top 10 Decks&amp;#8221; from Decktech and made a half-decent showing, although some people were still playing A-Wings and &quot;An Entire Legion of My Best Troops&amp;#8221;.  Anyway, here goes&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;<br />
<br />
<br />
First Match &amp;#8211; My DS vs. Greg Hodur (1853)<br />
<br />
Right, this was worth it.  Drive two hours to play the guy who lives 15 minutes from me in the first round.  Rich and Blythe did this to us last year at Coruscant Regionals too.  Damn.  Greg is playing Ghetto Squad HB to flip.  We pretty much ignore each other early, I set up on the ground while he sets up in space and just loses one a turn to Court.  He gets his planets out quick though, and flips right before I start draining for six on Tatooine.  So now he&amp;#8217;s going to start hitting me at Kessel while canceling my drains on the ground.  I can&amp;#8217;t have that so I have to go probing.  I tap Kessel with Dr. E/Ponda Baba on Chimaera on my deploy phase and am wrong, so I run to Endor to avoid Farmboy/Moff Wedge he had sitting at Kessel.  Why don&amp;#8217;t I play Security Precautions again?  Oh, that&amp;#8217;s right, nobody flips HB.  I probe Endor during his deploy phase and get lucky.  Now it&amp;#8217;s a race.  He&amp;#8217;s hitting me for three at Kessel, one at Kashyyyk, and two with Bren Quersey at Raithal.  I&amp;#8217;m getting one in the AC, three at the Moisture Farm, and two at DB:94.  With Court and S&amp;D hitting him I could maybe pull ahead, but of course he&amp;#8217;s got enough EPP&amp;#8217;s to make me chase him around on the ground while avoiding my direct damage.  So I get Thrawn on Chimaera and move to Kessel to try to block his big drain.  While flinging beat-squads at his EPP&amp;#8217;s on the ground.  Quickly we get to a point where we both have equal cards left and he has to make a decision.  Move Obi to try to block a drain, or let me drain *then* deploy to Obi&amp;#8217;s site.  He puts his cards down and just stares at the table for literally, minutes.  Finally he makes his decision.  He leaves Obi where he is, eats the drains, gets Obi killed.  It won him the game.  Next turn, drains me (he&amp;#8217;s killed off Chimaera by now since I was wasting force deploying to the ground and sh1t), deploys another Obi to the Pit of Carkoon.  I drain him down to two cards, he drains me out for the win.  Had he not had that extra Obi (or at least the force to deploy him), he would lost one to Court and one to S&amp;D during his  turn allowing my drains to just finish him off.  Instead, he survives my drain and finishes me off.  One of the hardest, closest games I&amp;#8217;ve ever had to play.  Bastard.<br />
<br />
Full Loss by 2.  0 (-2)<br />
<br />
In most other major tournies, one loss and you&amp;#8217;re done.  But in Jersey, 5-1 could still make it into the finals, especially a loss by only two cards.  Our biggest fear is that the small margin of victory would make us play each other again, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t.  Instead I get what I thought was going to be an easy game&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;<br />

Second Match &amp;#8211; My LS vs. Ted Baker (1473)<br />
<br />
O.K., either this kid is playing under one of his friend&amp;#8217;s names, or he has duplicate player ID&amp;#8217;s and I looked up the wrong one.  No way this kid has only played 10 sanctioned games.  He had plenty of cards in his deck that are only used by advanced players.  And it wasn&amp;#8217;t like he just copied a deck from somewhere, because he knew exactly what every card did, and when to play it.  Basically, he just didn&amp;#8217;t play like a townie.  And I would know, we can smell our own.  Anyway, he&amp;#8217;s playing MKOS w/ Abyssins, and gets a damn good opening draw.  First turn, he pulls the AC, drops a one-eye, drops Scum, drops Chall for 3, and pulls another one-eye that goes free.  My turn.  I throw Wedge at Kessel, and Signal for Battle Plan but don&amp;#8217;t deploy it, draw some.  He pulls the Lower Passages, Puny Jabba for 1, Ephant Mon for 1, and Gailid from his hand for free.  Drops Den of Thieves.  Then he moves some guys to the Lower Passages.  My turn, Jedi Luke to HO:DB, Freighter Crap-tain to DB:94, flip.  Deploy Battle Plan, move over JK Luke, his go.  He spends six to drain for 4, drops the Sail Barge to the Palace, and a bunch of free Abyssins.  I give Luke a stick, throw Han/Chewie at Tatooine, move Luke and Crap-tain to the Cantina, go.  He just spends nine to drain for six, draws a little.  I can feel him pulling ahead of me, so I start to Celebrate.  Dash in Ship to DB:94, Celebration, Dash takes off, Han/Chewie land in the DB.  His turn he plays Abyssin Ornament to get a one-eye to cancel my drain at Kessel (again), and I tell him to let me know right before he re-circulates.  He spends nine to drain me for six, draws a few, and tells me he&amp;#8217;s about to end his turn.  I&amp;#8217;ve only got once chance left at this game.  I assume he&amp;#8217;s playing 2 Abyssin Ornaments, and I know one is in his force pile.  I play Visored Vision from my lost pile naming the Ornament.  If he&amp;#8217;s got two in there, I may just kill his big retrieval and win the game.  If it&amp;#8217;s just the one, I&amp;#8217;m going to lose.  I get lucky.  The next to last card he spent to drain was the other ornament, so when I play it lost, I kill his retrieval.  On my turn I deploy Melas to the Palace (he had moved to try to block my Cantina drain), use Luke to clean out his Abyssins in the Cantina, and land Dash in the Desert Heart.  On his turn he only has 7 force left, spends it to drain me for four, leaving me with one card.  My turn, I retrieve four from Celebration, drain 3 at Kessel, 3 at the Cantina, 1 at DB94, and 2 each at the Palace and Desert Heart to win by 5.  So far this tourney has been much more work than I would have thought.<br />
<br />
Full Win by 5.  2(+3)<br />

Third Match vs. Michael Vitarelli (1636)<br />
<br />
When I first started playing, Mike was the guy who routinely beat my @#$% at our local shop.  But once he went to college, he started playing a lot less, and his rating suffered.  Bottom line though, he still knows how to play and brought the ISB Space that everybody loves so much right now.  This game was fairly uneventful.  He made his &amp;#8220;Big Ship&amp;#8221; with Executor and four pilots to chase me around space, but it was too slow.  By the time he had it set-up, I had already flipped to limit his activation, and was draining at Kessel and Tatooine and the Cantina.  We rarely battled and pretty much just drained and chased.  But between Jedi Luke draining for three in the Cantina and the fact that he had to pay three to drain for one in space (I kept making him chase me to planets like Kessel with small drains), it slowly whittled him away to the point where he was running out of options and was generally bored with the game.  He made the good sportsmanship offer to let me play any remaining Used Interrupts, and then drew up.<br />
<br />
Full Win by 17.  4(+20)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth Match vs. Thomas Hermley-Keen (1909)<br />
<br />
Historically, one of the great things about playing Tom was the fact that he was the only other person besides me who kept coming to tournament after tournament with goofy deck ideas.  I could always count on Tom to leave me guessing trying to figure out what in the hel1 he was playing.  But today I recognized it.  Anybody who starts Insurrection with Hidden Base is just going with Hidden Mains.  And him playing an early Throw Me Another Charge just confirmed it that much more.  Hidden Mains is definitely a good deck, but when you know what it is, you know how to play against it.  My first turn is standard, pull Carida, pull Exec.:DB, pull Jabba, pull Evader/Monnok, draw.  His turn he deploys a DB then draws a little, but goes over 13.  Monnok used.  My turn, pull Evader/Monnok, and begin fortifying the DB94 he just put out.  He deploys JK Luke to HO:DB, and I barrier him.  This throws Tom off a little.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t want to deploy anything else to DB94 since Luke can&amp;#8217;t move over so he waits and draws.  Monnok used.  I pull it again, drain, fortify some more.  Eventually he throws EPP Leia down to play On the Edge, and I grab it.  Now his retrieval is going to rely on Off the Edge, which means he&amp;#8217;s stuck at the CC:DB I couldn&amp;#8217;t care less about.  From then on, he is basically bouncing around CC:DB and DB94 trying to retrieve, and consolidate for the beatdown, AND stay below 13 cards.  He does a good job of it, but it&amp;#8217;s not an easy task.  Meanwhile, I&amp;#8217;m draining for 4 at the Moisture Farm, one at Endor, and one at Corulag.  He puts Melas in the Falcon at Carida to get some help from Menace Fades, but Thrawn and the Chimaera wanted to talk to him about that.  We dance around Corulag/Carida, and he deploys to Endor.  So from turn to turn, Menace Fades goes on and off.  When it&amp;#8217;s on, I drain for three he drains for two.  When it&amp;#8217;s off, I drain for something like eight.  He is however still getting good retreival.  The big beatdown the deck looks for never happens, and I manage to drain him out despite him managing to retrieve something like 20+ cards.  Another damn long game.  Pete hate thinking.<br />
<br />
Full Win by 14.  6 (+34)<br />
<br />
So now I&amp;#8217;m 3-1, but haven&amp;#8217;t gotten any solid differential.  I think I&amp;#8217;m something like 10th in the next pairings, so how that puts me against the Coruscant Regional Champ is beyond me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth Match vs. John Lolli (1865)<br />
<br />
I helped John playtest for about 15 minutes before we left, so I know he&amp;#8217;s playing ISB Space, and that my WYS shouldn&amp;#8217;t really beat it.  Of course, games between John and I have never come down to match-ups.  They&amp;#8217;ve always come down to the fact that I have NEVER gotten a remotely decent draw against him.  I had a chance to screw up his game.  First turn, he Imperial Commands for Piett, pulls Mejerrk, pulls Fondor.  My turn.  11 cards in my deck allow me to drop a ship w/ matching pilot first turn.  And for about only the second time in 20 games, NONE of them are in my opening hand.  Damn Lolli jinx.  One decent card, and I go to Fondor first turn to stop him from deploying Executor like he wants to.  Instead, I have to do NOTHING and draw because I got a hand full off red.  That was my one window of opportunity against this deck, and it slammed in my face.  From there, he just runs Big Blue across my carcass while his stupid undercover spies make JK Luke about as useful as me growing a third nipple.  I try to make the game respectable and hold out as long as I can, but I get my Bantha Droid the turn AFTER he Lateral Damages the Outirder, and never manage to get my feet back under me.  All told, I should probably take some solace from the fact that my WYS went toe-to-toe with ISB Space for the full 60 minutes and didn&amp;#8217;t die.  Instead, I feel bad for the fact we timed out.  It&amp;#8217;s bad enough I suck too much to make the finals, but the timed win cost my friend any chance he had too.  Sorry brother&amp;#8230;..<br />
<br />
Timed Loss by (I think) 11.  6 (+23)<br />
<br />
At this point, I just don&amp;#8217;t want to go home 3-3.  I&amp;#8217;ve been playing better than usual so far this year, and I&amp;#8217;d hate to leave States without at least having a winning record.  I&amp;#8217;d have liked to get one of the townies.  Afterall, Daulton got two townies, Scott got two townies, Lolli too.  Where are my townies?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sixth Match vs. Chris Lanci (1747)<br />
<br />
There&amp;#8217;s no doubt in my mind that Chris Lanci builds better decks than me.  But I still kinda have to smile on the inside, because at least God likes me better than Chris.  Whenever we play, something unforeseen costs Chris the game.  I&amp;#8217;m something like 3-1 against him, mostly because one specific event costs him the game each time.  Today was no different.  He was playing MWYHL to Test 6.  Since he was kind enough to give me two extra force from Dagobah, I put Mara and he saber in the AC first turn, figuring I might as well squeeze out every possible card before Test 1 gets completed.  This turns out to be a money-play.  On my  second turn, I drain for two instead of one because of the saber.  He decides to lose the second card from the top of his reserve, and loses his only DOS.  Now he has to decide between giving up his best ground fighter to train Luke, or just training some ability four scrub who won&amp;#8217;t flip the objective.  Once he sees me Twi&amp;#8217;Lek for CHYBC, he decides to train Tawss Khaa and just use his other characters to try to fight me off and get the differential down.  You have to give him credit for refusing to give up, but between my power characters and monnok-ing his hand down anythime he draws up some cards, there just wasn&amp;#8217;t much he could do.  It was really the direct damage of Court and S&amp;D that killed him once the apprentice was gone.  I felt bad for winning that way, but I&amp;#8217;m not too proud to take what I can get.  I know I&amp;#8217;ve lost my fair-share of games to that same type of awful luck.<br />
<br />
Full Win by 23.  8 (+46)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I finish in something like fifth out of 28.  Not too bad for a scrub, but I had really hoped to do better.  Mike Daulton won the final duel taking first, Scott Lingrell took second, Greg Hodur took third.  I forget who was in fourth, I took fifth, and a townie came up out of nowhere to get sixth.  So I earned myself two packs of Cloud Sh1tty and a pack of Jabba&amp;#8217;s Fat-@ss.  I promptly gave them to the dude who took third from last.  Last place got a Darth Maul, so I figured he got enough.  I guess I have to do shout-outs or something now, so here goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
*Mike Daulton for doing me the one favor I&amp;#8217;ve ever asked of him, and beating Scott in the final duel.  I like Scott, but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend the next year hearing about his repeat as Champ.<br />
*Rich Haman and Blythe Hermley-Keen for running another smooth tourney.<br />
*Espositos&amp;#8217; for making a slammin&amp;#8217; roast beef sandwich that almost made me forget that the people at Poppa Tony&amp;#8217;s were to lazy to work on Sundays.<br />
*John Lolli for getting&amp;#8217; his @ss outta retirement. (and for driving, I hate North Jersey traffic)<br />
*Comic Images for making Raw Deal, a game so simple you can play it in-between games of a Star Wars tournament.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kicks in the head:<br />
*Decipher&amp;#8217;s stupid @ss tournament software that constantly pairs up Greg and I for the first match of every goddamn tournament.<br />
*Poppa Tony&amp;#8217;s for making the best chicken sandwich on earth, but not being open on days we have tournaments.<br />
*Long Branch, NJ, for having a beach that would turn to concrete if it rained.  My feet still hurt from running around on that sh1t Saturday.<br />
