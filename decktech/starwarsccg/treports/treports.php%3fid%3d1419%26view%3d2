at times.<br />
<br />
So I set the alarm for 7:00am and go to bed at around 4:00. I wake up to<br />
Batman Beyond and Pokemon, then I drag myself out of bed, nuke a couple<br />
Pop Tarts, count my decks again and again, and head off to the<br />
tournament. This isn&#146;t actually the Grand Slam; this is the 8-game Mega-Tourney, part of the Grand Slam weekend. I&#146;ve been hyping myself up all week, telling myself I&#146;m<br />
gonna win it all and all that. I was ready to go! I had a new EBO deck<br />
that has the potential to be a killer if I get it set up right, and I<br />
have been working on my old PalpyOps from long ago for DS. As a note to<br />
all my readers: Diamond sites are NOT dead unless you&#146;re playing the<br />
LS card! Same goes with numbers; it&#146;s not retired unless you play the<br />
card. I get to AZ Gamer and realize that my pop tarts are still in the<br />
microwave. Oops. I see Andy Marcantel, David Teeters, and a couple other<br />
buddies and fill out the decklist and command card. Brandon Allen<br />
informs me that I put my email addy above my player ID and I need to<br />
change it before he can put it on the command card. The lady next to me<br />
rolls her eyes and just writes the information down. I tell Brett that I&#146;m gonna win, and he encourages me instead of the laughter I was expecting. Cool! We finally get<br />
settled for our first pairings.<br />
<br />
GAME 1: PalpyOps vs. Matthew&#146;s Hoth w/ elom reacts (not EBO)<br />
I haven&#146;t seen this guy before, so I don&#146;t know what to think. There are<br />
a lot of out-of-state players, but there are also newbies from AZ. I<br />
decide before the game starts that I&#146;m gonna open a can. I present to<br />
you, ladies and gentlemen, God&#146;s starting hand: Lord Vader, Palpy, Mara,<br />
Mara&#146;s Stick, Royal Guard x 2, Abyssian Ornament, and the Exec DB. I<br />
pull the Prefect&#146;s Office and the Coruscant DB from my deck, drop the<br />
EDB, and a Royal Guard at each DB. He drew his Force into his hand. I<br />
still don&#146;t know what to think of him. I couldn&#146;t set up Ralltiir<br />
because I activated my Forest and Spaceport DB in my God-like generation<br />
next turn. He deploys AFA in the deck after I deploy everybody, DRAT! I<br />
have Fett in S1 in my hand, and I pop AFA in the generation. I activate<br />
2 and use it to search for ghhhk. I&#146;m gonna deploy Fett on the ground<br />
with his little &quot;army&quot; and soak the damage. IT&#146;S NOT THERE! So I pull<br />
U3PO instead and take the 4 damage. He tries to give someone a jedi<br />
lightsaber to drain with, but Weapon Of The Ingrate takes care of that.<br />
Davod Jon an appearance and overpowered his army of 4, taking out<br />
everything except a droid and sacrificing himself to the 3 attrition.<br />
DRAT! I had a drain of 9 going to his 0, and there was nothing he could<br />
do. I didn&#146;t have enough Guards to make Abyssian work, but I should have<br />
used Weapon Of The Ingrate to put the sabers and Pikes back in the deck.<br />
Too bad.<br />
<br />
FW by 19<br />
2(+19)<br />
<br />
PROS: I&#146;m getting settled in. I&#146;m not used to a tournament this big, but I&#146;m getting relaxed now.<br />
CONS: None, really. I kinda wish I had used my Weapon of Ingrate to add to my dif.<br />

hovers over me and asks for my LS deck. I had counted this deck 10 times<br />
over and over again; I know it&#146;s 60 cards! I was worried sick about it.<br />
Turns out I forgot to add the &quot;x 2&quot; to my YT-1300s, giving me a warning.<br />
I take my deck back with a thousand apologies, feeling very glad we<br />
didn&#146;t abide by DecipherCon rules. Thanks again, Mike!<br />
<br />
GAME 2: EBO Capitals vs. Jonny&#146;s BHBM<br />
As we&#146;re setting up our starting cards, Clint Hays beside me tells his<br />
opponent not to stack his effects. If he does it again, it&#146;s a game<br />
warning! A couple jokes about the rules and penalties broke out, then we<br />
started the game. As I&#146;m typing this, it just doesn&#146;t have the same<br />
impact it did at the time. It was funny when it happened; I guess you<br />
had to be there. Anyways...<br />
So my hand consists of Strikeforce (you need it in EBO!), Chasm (a<br />
painfully powerful card), Honor, and Menace Fades for effects, 2<br />
capitals, Endor, and a Signal. Nothing to help get EBO going at all. I<br />
deployed my effects, and he nearly choked when he read Chasm. &quot;So, how<br />
many Vaders are you playing with today?&quot; It&#146;s just awesome. He put IG88<br />
w/, Dr. E, and Mara with her stick at a drain 3 location, so I signaled<br />
for Undercover instead of Squad Assign and dropped my newly drawn<br />
Cracken. I couldn&#146;t stop pulling Signals, and it was kinda annoying.<br />
Squadron Assign didn&#146;t help at all because I couldn&#146;t get a pilot or a<br />
ship. I lost too much blue to drains, too. Cappy Han, Home 1, and the<br />
Independence made quick work of Ozzel in the Exec, but allowed Zuckuss<br />
to escape to Kiffex. Unfortunately, I wouldn&#146;t get any more blue the<br />
entire game. I gave him Luke JK from my lost pile as soon as Lord Vader<br />
hit Endor to give him a little Direct Damage. Here&#146;s where I&#146;m a bad<br />
player. He&#146;s draining for 3 at each of 3 Endor sites; 1 icon, a +1, and<br />
a saber. I have Menace Fades on the Table, Hoth belongs to me and Kiffex<br />
I&#146;m working on, and Obi is holding the 4th Marker. I didn&#146;t cancel his<br />
drain modifiers the entire game, and it killed me. I&#146;m a bad player. I<br />
don&#146;t know what my cards do. Palpatine left his home on the DS2 for some<br />
reason, I don&#146;t know why. I would have won this game if I had known why<br />
I put the cards in my deck that I did. Keep count; this is game 1 that I<br />
should have won.<br />
<br />

2(+6)<br />
<br />
PROS: Definitely the starting hand! Seeing his face when he read Chasm.<br />
CONS: Gee, there&#146;s so many to list! I won&#146;t forget Menace Fades again. I wish I remembered how to use spies.<br />
<br />
GAME 3: PalpyOps vs. Mike&#146;s HB w/out flip<br />
This was by far the most fun game I played all day. Wedge RSL and Gen<br />
Cal showed up in their respective ships at Tatooine, but I flipped, so<br />
he didn&#146;t have a drain. He pulled Dagobah and the Hutt, Tatooine, and<br />
Alderaan, but that was it. I flipped turn 2. He tried to bring his EPP<br />
army against my Royal Guards. I wouldn&#146;t have minded being that I had<br />
the ghhhk in my hand, but I decided to tell him that all his guys were<br />
+2. He pulled back and waited a little. We battled all over space and on<br />
the ground. Putting Palpy or LVader at the Prefect&#146;s Office creates a<br />
beast! My power 4, Def Value 4 Royal Guards were kicking all kinds of<br />
butt. And Goo Nee Tay can&#146;t touch em! He won our Sense/Alter war,<br />
putting all my cancellers in my lost pile because I didn&#146;t get out<br />
Oppressive Enforcement in time, and he used Our Most Desparate Hour 3<br />
times to retrieve 6 or 7 Force each time. He had to work for it because<br />
CHYBC was on the table, but he managed. I flipped that objective back<br />
and forth more times than I can remember. Fett in S1 and Bossk in Bus<br />
took on Wedge and the Falcon, leaving Calrissian all alone against<br />
Bossk. He deployed Nien Nunb and battled me, I played Res Luk, but he<br />
Sensed it! That is the best use of that card; in space with the perm<br />
pilots! They don&#146;t count as bounty hunters, but the OR works with Bossk<br />
and Fett. Anyway, that single battle probably lost me the game with the<br />
amount of cards I lost. Time was called, and after a battle, I played<br />
Abyssian Ornament, knowing full well that I only had 3 guards on the<br />
table and my destiny was a 3. I just wanted the 5 in the deck and on the<br />
top! Now, had I actually used it during that battle before I lost my 4th<br />
royal guard, it would have been much better! Time was called on my<br />
deploy phase, otherwise I would have grabbed Weapon of the Ingrate and<br />
pulled 4 pikes and 2 sabers back in the deck. We counted; I had 11 cards<br />
in the deck, and he had 12. :-(   Still counting? This is game #2 that I<br />
should have won but didn&#146;t because I&#146;m a bad player. But this was a<br />
completely awesome game. He had me sign his Sense in memory of our<br />
little war.<br />
<br />
TL by 12<br />
2(-6)<br />
<br />
PROS: This was a fantastic game. I played my strategy very well against him.<br />
CONS: Having time called just after my control phase ended. Timing out in the first place.<br />
<br />
Okay, okay... I came into this not wanting to suck as bad as I did at<br />
Pat&#146;s tourney. At least I won a game today!<br />
<br />
GAME 4: EBO Capitals vs. Mike Sinclair&#146;s Hunt Down w/ Please-Rape-Me<br />
Duels<br />
I hate playing Mike. He always beats me, even though it&#146;s never by a<br />
lot. But I&#146;ve never won a game against him. Before the game, I get all<br />
@#$%y with him in fun. I&#146;ve got 5 characters, 4 of them pilots, and 2 of<br />
them spies. How cool is that! He didn&#146;t start No Escape, so I signaled<br />
for Honor instead of cancelling Visage. Vader came to play on Hoth, and<br />
I lured him under the shield as I deployed Obi to his CC to flip him.<br />
Igar in Tempest 1 make short work of hero and Vader comes out of the<br />
base to flip again. Jedi Luke wants to see if he can survive longer than<br />
his mentor, so he visits the city in the sky next. All the while, EBO is<br />
set up, but I&#146;m only draining at Hoth because Zuckuss, IG88 w/, and 4LOM<br />
w/ took control of Kiffex too early, and I&#146;m not going anywhere near<br />
that little combo. He eventually gets Bossk out to Hoth and moves the<br />
Z-crew over. I know the true power of bounty hunter ships and realize<br />
that he is getting 4 destinies, but for some reason I stay there. I was<br />
hoping in those destinies he would get a dupe and lose it to Chasm, the<br />
little effect hiding on the corner of the table. BUT NO! I draw a 3 and<br />
a 2, and he draws 3 destiny 6 cards!!!!! And they&#146;re all interrupts, so<br />
Chasm doesn&#146;t touch them! I got royally screwed, and there was nothing I<br />
could do about it. He lost his droids, I lost nearly everything. I can&#146;t<br />
do much against attrition of 20! I&#146;m not immune to that. He pulled<br />
destiny 6 every time, and it was painful. Luke held his ground on CC the<br />
entire game until I knew I was gonna lose, so I left him alone with<br />
Igar. He pulls a couple destiny 6 cards again to my 5. It was fun, but<br />
painful!<br />

<br />
PROS: Not losing by more<br />
CONS: Playing Mike<br />
<br />
Remember when I said I didn&#146;t want to screw up like I did in Pat&#146;s<br />
tourney? Well, it&#146;s not looking good for our hero today.<br />
<br />
GAME 5: PalpyOps vs. Andy Marcantel&#146;s MWYHL to 6<br />
My starting hand had 3 docking bays in it. That&#146;s not normal! I like<br />
playing Andy; he knows how to have fun. I easily set up Ralltiir, but it<br />
takes him 3 turns to begin training. Overseeing It Personally comes out<br />
a turn too late, so I don&#146;t get to double my drains. Fett blocks his<br />
B-Wings at the system to flip me over, and he lands amidst the army. I<br />
soon realize he&#146;s playing a version of Chris Shaner&#146;s MWYHL that I lost<br />
to long ago before I really knew how to play. He&#146;s holding Coruscant<br />
with 7 B-Wings and S-Foils! When I finally get Bossk, Zuckuss, and 4LOM,<br />
I take the trip to the center of the Old Republic. I also held onto a<br />
ghhhk. We battled over and over again, but my recurring bounty hunter<br />
ships and cool use of Res Luk was too much for him. He got beat off the<br />
planet, and Fett held control for the rest of the game. He couldn&#146;t draw<br />
his test 5 destiny because he didn&#146;t have a reserve deck (he was low on<br />
cards), and he couldn&#146;t retrieve his 10 because of CHYBC. Too bad! I<br />
drained him out after a few turns. He&#146;s always fun to play, and we<br />
chatted with the guys beside us. My losing streak brought me to the fun<br />
table!<br />
<br />

<br />
PROS: I like Andy. He&#146;s fun. And PalpyOps does it again. He was a couple places higher than me in round 3, so I&#146;m glad I took it to him. Beating down the B-Wings<br />
CONS: Letting him control Ralltiir with his b-wings for a turn.<br />
<br />
GAME 6: EBO Capitals vs. John Towner<br />
He decided to concede the match to me before we started to go play Trek.<br />
I still think leaving StarWars for Trek is blasphemy or something, but<br />
hey, I&#146;ve got 30 points and an even record at 3-3.<br />
<br />
FW by 30<br />

<br />
PROS: Hey, it&#146;s 30 points!<br />
CONS: Leaving SW for Trek? Come on!<br />
<br />
Yes folks, we&#146;re still going! Our 4 round / 8 game tournament continues.<br />
This is fun! We should do it more often.<br />
<br />
GAME 7: PalpyOps vs. Joel&#146;s Profit M+T<br />
I just finished playing his brother Mike in game 3, and it was fun. I<br />
decide not to put Mara in the Aud Chamber. I set up quick, and he<br />
battled against 5 of my power 4, defense 4 royal guards and lost over<br />
and over again! I LOVE THE PREFECT&#146;S OFFICE!!! He failed a Fallen Portal<br />
draw against a single royal guard at one point. Like before, there was a<br />
lot of battles on the ground, but neither of us took to space. He was<br />
unfortunately killing all of my characters, leaving me with fewer and<br />
fewer cards. DVDLOTS got lost cruising around DB 94, and I never<br />
bothered to find him. The constant killing and Profit DD did me in. This<br />
was another really fun game, and there was no way I could have won this<br />
game by doing it differently. I even tried to abyssian ornament for 5<br />
with just a couple cards left in the deck, but I drew Palpy! DRAT! This<br />
was fun.<br />
<br />

<br />
PROS: Another fantastic game. Putting the Prefect&#146;s Office in the deck.<br />
CONS: I should have killed Han earlier.<br />
<br />
GAME 8: EBO Capitals vs. Van&#146;s ISB with ORS<br />
Finally; and out-of-state player! This game was just ugly. I have never<br />
played against an ISB deck, so I already knew that this could suck for<br />
me. I don&#146;t know how to play against it. On top of that, I got set up<br />
too late. He set up his drains big and fast on me. I was draining for<br />
10, but he cancelled the 4 @ Kiffex with the Den Of Theives. I couldn&#146;t<br />
find Strike Planning to stop him from cancelling drains, and he couldn&#146;t<br />
find a trample to get rid of my undercover spies. I took out Bossk and<br />
Fett at the expense of the Spiral (it deploys as a react for 1 with EBO<br />
in effect!), and he never tried space again. He won the drain race<br />
because he beat me off the 4th marker, cancelling Menace Fades&#146; effect.<br />
It was a fun game, he was a good guy, and I&#146;m glad I finally got to play<br />
against this deck type.<br />

<br />
PROS: Finally playing an ISB deck.<br />
CONS: Losing to an ISB deck.<br />
<br />
So I almost scrubbed out. I guess it was borderline. I came 32nd out of<br />
56, so I was right there in the middle again. My prize support of 1 CC<br />
and 2 DS2 packs along with a &quot;grab pack&quot; with Vaper Crall and DS2<br />
commons (just what I needed) worked out great; I pulled a Jedi Luke!<br />
That was worth the $15. Thanks a lot to AZG for hosting us on this late<br />
event, Mike Girard, Brandon Allen, and Jay Webb for running an amazing<br />
tournament, and everyone else that helped out for doing so. I wish I<br />
could have recorded the top 10 scores, but I didn&#146;t get them all. Brett<br />
Kitani took 6th place overall. I stayed after for the final<br />
confrontation, and after the dust settled, Kevin Shannon beat Brian Hunter to<br />
take sole possession of 1st place and the entire BB StarWars set. They<br />
agreed before the match to give 2nd place the set of Reflections and 1st<br />
place everything else. I&#146;m pretty sure that was the arrangement; we<br />
couldn&#146;t hear what they were saying over everyone talking! j/k. Thanks a<br />
lot for a great time!<br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
* Arizona Gamer for hosting the event<br />
* Michael Girard (Gold 120) for running a HUGE yet flawless tournament<br />
* Kevin Shannon for winning the thing<br />
* Brett Kitani for placing 6th overall<br />
* All the out of towners that made the trip, especially Clint Hays, Kevin Shannon, and Brian Hunter.<br />
* Everyone who stayed at AZGamer from 8am til 9:30pm for the whole shbang.<br />
<br />
The Bad and The Ugly:<br />
* Me for scrubbing hard<br />
* P.H. for placing lower than me - When he said he was having a Steve day, he meant it!<br />
* Mike Sinclair for constantly saying penis throughout the day ;-)<br />
* The traffic on I-17 for making me late (8:45)<br />
