<br />
Scot Vales tells me WAY ahead of time that he is thinking about hosting another of his famous scenario tournaments. He sends me a list of the scenario points and we fight over it to make it work, and I&#39;m soon testing <br />
<br />
different decks. In this format (for the sake of prizes & placing), you get 2 points for a scenario win, 1 point for a regular win, 1 point for any modified win, 1 point for a scenario loss, and 0 points for a non-scenario loss. <br />
<br />
A scenario win is when you can complete enough predetermined objectives to gain 10 points. The points my decks were designed to take advantage of are:<br />
<br />
LIGHT SIDE:<br />
2 points for not including any Ep1 cards<br />
2 points for not including any upkeep cards<br />
6 points for the first time the Falcon take off from DB94 with any 4 of the following: Han, Chewie, Luke, Ben, R2-D2, C-3P0<br />
2 points for any persona replacement of Han<br />
1 point for each alien &quot;hit&quot; by Chewbacca with a bowcaster<br />
1 point every time 2 aliens initiate a battle against Jabba at a Tatooine Docking Bay<br />
1 points each time Artoo and Threepio are present at a Tatooine battleground during your draw phase<br />
1 point for playing A Few Manuevers<br />
<br />
DARK SIDE:<br />
2 points for not including any Ep1 cards <br />
2 points for not including any upkeep cards<br />
2 points for having a Tatooine battleground site as my starting location<br />
1 point each time my aliend of ability=1 drains at Mos Eisley or a Tatooine docking bay<br />
1 point each time my opponent&#39;s alien or Han lost by a Han Seeker<br />
1 point each battle initiated by Jabba and another alien at a Tatooine docking bay<br />
1 point each time Prophetess retrieves Force<br />
1 point for each Force drain by Jabba with ability < 4<br />
1 point for playing: Nevar Yalnal & Jabba&#39;s Twerps<br />
<br />
I was playing a basic mains deck with more aliens than normal as my light, and an alien deck for Dark. I was much more comfortable with my light and wish I had more time to work on the DS, but I just had too much <br />
<br />
work to do for school & stuff. Graduating in June, baby!<br />
<br />
So every LS game, I start with 4 points and need to have the Falcon take off. The DS starts with 6 and just needs to let Jabba & crew hold the Aud Chamber for 4 turns. The backup plans are just for fun. I just bought <br />
<br />
Zach Marshall&#39;s collection from him, and I see he&#39;s got all these extra Cappy Hans in the box! I tell Pat Hug (the Cappy Han MASTER) that I&#39;ve got some extra, and I intend to rip him off in order to part with them. He <br />
<br />
agrees. ;-) For 3 Captains (and some other stuff, of course), I get 2 Ref3 Obi-Wans, a Lord Maul, a Double Saber. a Destroyer Droid, and Rolling Rolling Rolling. The Obis are for a deck - the rest is for a collection of a <br />
<br />
set I never bought. And now the games begin. I&#39;m 1735 going in.<br />
<br />
GAME 1: LS vs. Brandon&#39;s scenario deck (1500)<br />
<br />
Sorry dude, I didn&#39;t catch your last name! DOH! I&#39;m a scrub. Anyway, this guy&#39;s been playing for about a month, so I play appropriately. I put (v) Chewie at the Home One docking bay to generate a few more Force, and <br />
<br />
he pulls everything I need to get a successful Falcon in the sky. He pulls EPP Han, then the Falcon, then Squadron Assignments gets Artoo & Threepio, deploy Han, tranist Chewie, take off, and that&#39;s how we get 10 <br />
<br />
scenario points. I was very proud that I achieved scenario a few minutes before Pat could do it in his game - we were playing nearly identical decks, it turns out. Randomly.<br />
<br />
The Falcon subsequently lands to let Chewie and the droid(s) off, adds Leia, replaces Han with the Captain (2 more points!), Ounee Ta gets the good ol&#39; EPP back (just in case), and takes off again next turn. He puts <br />
<br />
the Conquest in front of the Falcon and initiates to get his points (he gets 1 point each time the Conquest looks at Light Side&#39;s hand), but he soon learns that it&#39;s just a bad idea as I draw my 6, 4, and 6 while he&#39;s <br />
<br />
sitting there without a draw. I neglect to play the Punch It and I Know in my hand because he&#39;s new. Anyway, he&#39;s got a power 9 ship with 9 forfeit, so he owes me 4 more overflow. I realize I could have ended the <br />
<br />
game, but that&#39;s not cool for a new player.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s beating me up on the ground, though. Artoo has a bad feeling and doesn&#39;t let Bossk and some other ability 2 scrub draw a destiny, although both the droid combo and the wookiee get hit. I hit Bossk back, netting <br />
<br />
me yet another scenario point, but that&#39;s about it. I let him sit for a turn while I draw some characters, then Ben & Luke make short work of the last few characters in his deck. I drop Celebration and let Dash take <br />
<br />
space while the Falcon crew lands on the 3rd battleground, and he soon draws up.<br />
<br />
Scenario Win by 37<br />
2 (+37)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: He avoided the basic mistakes most of the time: Always had a destiny draw during battle except once, didn&#39;t forget to Force drain a single turn (wow), read Goo Nee Tay and the spaceport DB&#39;s game text, <br />
<br />
and all that. Coolness!<br />
THE BAD: I was really tempted to play Punch It and I Know in that battle, ending the game about 5 turns in. Had he not been new, it would have happened :-(<br />
THE UGLY: He was really taking ground pretty well before I finally found Ben. The diff between our life forces was only about 10-15 before Celebration & Ben hit the table.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: A newbie who doesn&#39;t forget to Force drain? Amazing.<br />
<br />
GAME 2: DS vs. Scot Vales&#39;s &quot;Ow It Hurts&quot; HB (1663)<br />
<br />
Scot didn&#39;t have the time to build a LS deck because of stuff in his personal life which I don&#39;t feel the need to disclose here. It&#39;s legit. So instead, I let him use my Hidden Base deck because (1) it&#39;s just amusing to do, <br />
<br />
(2) it was the only LS deck I had to test against my scenario deck, so I know I can win, (3) the &quot;Lush factor&quot; hasn&#39;t been updated yet, so it&#39;s not as good as it needs to be, and (4) I don&#39;t have another LS deck to give <br />
<br />
him. Anyway, I play 5 spies in my scenario deck. I need to get one of them in my opening hand in the worst way or this game is only gonna last about 4 turns.<br />
<br />
So who do I get?<br />
<br />
MARA JADE!!!!!<br />
<br />
Sweetness. This game is mine. I kill Dodonna as soon as he hits the table, and I sit at the Echo Corridor and wait. I know he needs to put Romas at the War Room, and Rieekan is at the Docking Bay. He&#39;s going to <br />
<br />
have to move Rieekan over (ALONE) and drop an xwing to the DB to pull off EBO, and I&#39;ll be able to beat the living crap out of the good general if he decides to make such a move. Meanwhile, Reegesk has been in the <br />
<br />
Audience Chamber since turn 1 with None Shall Pass, Barrier, AND Projective to protect him. He&#39;s been stealing xwings and cannons from the lost pile as soon as they hit. Turns out the deck isn&#39;t totally complete yet, <br />
<br />
as Scot is playing Bargaining Table instead of Rebel Fleet (I didn&#39;t have time to replace my proxies!!!). No cancelling drains for you! ;-)<br />
<br />
He finally gets the shield up after beating up Mara with a few EPPs (this is the first, non-classic version of HB remember), but he&#39;s not doing well in space. He&#39;s lost a few wings already, and I&#39;ve got them in hand. I go <br />
<br />
to Kiffex (the system he&#39;s got with 2 wings), shoot one of them down, lose 3 worthless cards from hand, and steal his wing I just shot down next turn while saving 3. I spread MY xwings to beat up on HIS xwings and <br />
<br />
use the Virago as forfeit fodder in front of a lone xwing, and I&#39;m moving to counter his drains while saving a few to make sure I can shoot stuff down. I also quickly get out the Wampa cave and begin ominously moving <br />
<br />
my characters under the shield, a move he doesn&#39;t appreciate very much. He&#39;s letting my drains of 2 and 3 go by while cancelling my drain of 1 by Jabba (a scenario point) and my drain with Mosep & Gailid at the DB <br />
<br />
(another scenario point), and I&#39;m stuck at 9 points. I finally move Jabba out, he cancels the drain at the Aud Chamber, and the drain outside gets my my 10th point. SUCCESS!!! Sweet. And it turns out I can&#39;t move an <br />
<br />
xwing from Kessel to Tibrin, so he gets a single drain of 3 on me there before being defeated.<br />
<br />
Scenario Win by 37<br />
4 (+74)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: I beat up my own broken deck. I&#39;m really glad I play 5 spies & know the weakness of my own doing.<br />
THE BAD: Scot&#39;s frustrated now. This game just wasn&#39;t right because of Reegesk & the early 6 card loss from Dodonna.<br />
THE UGLY: Him losing Bargaining Table off the top and realizing that this may be more difficult than he first thought. He&#39;s also never played this deck, and it&#39;s not his style, so it was tougher than he gave it credit for.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Scot&#39;s my buddy and takes it in stride.<br />
<br />
GAME 3: DS vs. Pat Hug&#39;s scenario (1977)<br />
<br />
Judging by the scores, we&#39;re going to be playing the last 2 games together. There were battles upon battles upon battles! I know going into this game that my DS doesn&#39;t stand much of a chance, since our LS decks <br />
<br />
are so close together. But I put out some beats anyway. I wind up getting 15 scenario points this game because he never touches the drain by Jabba in the Audience Chamber (the first time he tried, I dropped a None <br />
<br />
Shall Pass, and he didn&#39;t do it again). He takes the system with the Home One, and I can&#39;t find any ships at all. I steal his Red Leader In Red 1, but that&#39;s not enough to take out the flagship, and I can&#39;t find any 6s to <br />
<br />
track. I also managed to steal a saber or 2, though. He&#39;s celebrating all game because I can&#39;t do enough damage to his characters at sites. I finally get EPP Vader and Circle ready to do battle against his Ben & Leia, <br />
<br />
but turns out he&#39;s got a saber, and that&#39;s too bad for me. I suicide anyway and draw too low to hit Ben, so of course he doesn&#39;t lose anybody. He never deploys Kenobi without a saber, so I can&#39;t Circle him. That&#39;s really <br />
<br />
too bad.<br />
<br />
Scenario Loss by 24<br />
5 (+50)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: There was no good in this game. There aren&#39;t enough good aliens to counter a full-out mains attack, so S&V may not have been the best choice for this scenario tournament.<br />
THE BAD: Not being able to hit Ben, steal his saber, something! No Circle!<br />
THE UGLY: Not finding any ships or 6s all game kinda hurt, too. That would have turned the tide dramatically.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: You build a good deck. You also couldn&#39;t get a scenario win from me.<br />
<br />
GAME 4: LS vs&#39;s Pat Hug&#39;s randomness scenario (1977)<br />
<br />
So he&#39;s been ranting & raving about his DS all day long, and I get to see what it&#39;s all about. Turns out he&#39;s doing mains. All mains. He starts the Cantina and uses the Endor interrupt to get Jabba&#39;s Palace, no effects to <br />
<br />
start. He decided that he&#39;s never played a deck with 6 Emperors in it before, so this would be a good time to try it. He&#39;s got those, 2-3 Maras, at least 4 Vaders, and all kinds of cronies to totally anihillate anything that I <br />
<br />
could ever hope to throw at him. Oh yeah - he&#39;s also playing Spec Ed Jabba to get the last 4 scenario points he needs, and since he&#39;s backed up with Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, I can&#39;t get to him.<br />
<br />
The other problem with this game is that I can&#39;t find my characters at all. I&#39;ve searched through my deck 4 times, and no Han. I finally let Chewie, the droids, and Ben fly to space to get my scenario points, because I&#39;m <br />
<br />
really really low on Life Force and I know I can&#39;t win. He gets met with Zuckuss, 4LOM, and Bossk. Great. I don&#39;t get a draw, and I lost Artoo&#39;s bad feeling early on from the top. I lose Ben and a floating Outrider (bad <br />
<br />
times for Dash earlier), and I get to deploy Ben next turn with his saber, both of which are in my hand. I finally get Cappy Han and Luke upstairs. He senses my Punch It, but I still wipe his entire fleet away with Han as <br />
<br />
my only loss.<br />
<br />
Now on the ground. I&#39;m drawing absolutely horrible destiny. I&#39;m talking about my deck of 15 cards that has a single card of destiny 1, all the rest are 5 or higher. It gets shuffled, so it&#39;s blind. I don&#39;t worry about it <br />
<br />
because what are the odds that I&#39;ll get the 1? Well, apparently they&#39;re pretty good. That sucked. I&#39;m also still having trouble finding my characters. My lack of characters along with the fact that his characters all say <br />
<br />
&quot;immune to attrition of whatever Steve draws&quot; mean that I&#39;m going to lose this game. This deck is packed with high destiny, I just can&#39;t find it. I can&#39;t win with a setup like that, certianly not against Pat.<br />
<br />
Scenario Loss by 24<br />
6 (+26)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: Again - no good in this game. When you&#39;re playing mains vs. interrupts, the mains generally win.<br />
THE BAD: Drawing the only 1 amidst an ocean of destiny 5 and above. Only I could achieve something that bad.<br />
THE UGLY: Chewie & Artoo as the only pilots to the Falcon? With Ben in the back seat? Come on.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Scrounging up the 6 palpys to put in a deck. Managing a scenario win with this pile.<br />
<br />
So I still manage to come in 2nd place overall. I get an Alter foil, which is good because I didn&#39;t have one before. I also get a Spec Ed pack out of the prizes. I tell everybody that this is good because I needed a Vader. <br />
<br />
Open the pack - IT&#39;S VADER. I should have said that a lot more often back in the day, apparently! Pat speaks up, and I quickly give him the Vader for a few tournament foils I didn&#39;t have yet. Good tournament, good <br />
<br />
prizes, and fun people, even if only 6 showed up. I&#39;m looking forward to Scot&#39;s next scenario tournament, then hopefully a few highly competitive tournaments in Phoenix before DPC Vegas in May! VEGAS BABY!<br />
<br />
PROPS:<br />
* Eloy Public Library for hosting us & having a bigger actual game room than most card shops I&#39;ve played in. :-) Russ is the coolest!<br />
* Scot for hosting scenario<br />
* Everybody who showed up for having a good time<br />
* Brandon for not forgetting to drain<br />
* Scot for reminding us all how good landspeed 5 speeder bikes can be on a huge planet<br />
* Pat for using 6 palpatines<br />
<br />
SLOPS:<br />
* Pat for HAVING 6 palpatines. :-P<br />
* My boss for trying to call me into work at 7:00 while I was trying to leave!!! ARRGGHHH!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for coming down! Hopefully we&#39;ll get more people next time! Scot usually gets MANY more people than this - guess it was just a bad schedule or something. Who knows. See you next time! <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=4247&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
