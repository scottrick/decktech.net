Plus, I am posting a TR Sealed deck tournament, which I am sure many of you have not seen in a VERY long time. Sorry for the time delay in the dates. I had to track down some info. <br />
<br />
On Saturday, April 30th, the all powerful group in Nashville, TN decided to have a good old fashion Sealed Deck at our local store. We had been talking about getting one together for a long time now, but never got around to it until now. We told the store owner that if he got the cards in we would provide the players to play. Until then, all the store ever had was Unlimited premiere, Tatooine, Jabbas Palace, and Cloud City. Now we all know that any reasonable player would have all he ever needed of those sets, plus they alone make horrible sets for a sealed tournament. So in order to get a good Sealed Deck tournament together, the store would have to get some more variety. We requested to get Death Star 2 Starter decks, and some Theed Palace. He came through with both so it was set that for $15 we would get one Starter of DS2 and three packs of Theed. <br />
<br />
All of this was put into effect a month ago, so all there was left to do is wait. Well, the day finally came, and 10 players showed up for the first Sealed Deck tournament for SWCCG in like over 2 years, maybe longer. We had one player for Kentucky and one from three hours away in Knoxville. <br />
<br />
Listed are the 10 players who made the trip. They are in no kind of order, and the last names are left out to protect the weak Seal Deck players or simply because I just dont know all of them. <br />
<br />
1  Me, Brandon <br />
2  Jonathan, KY Boy <br />
3  Danny<br />
4  Micah<br />
5  Tommy <br />
6  Jody <br />
7  Bryan<br />
8  Jessie <br />
9  Justin, Knoxville<br />
10  Scott<br />
<br />
Not a bad set up at all for any kind of tournament these days. <br />
<br />
On the day of the tournament, Micah (TD), decided to change it up for what we would be playing because he believed that the two Darths would be two powerful for the darkside combined with the DS2 starter. In place of the Theed packs, there would be a larger variety of chooses for us to play around with. We got one pack of Unlimited, Tatooine, Hoth, and Jabbas Palace. Talk about possibilities, there could be any number of cards that might show up in a game. The box of Theed that we had already paid for, was given as the price support for the tournament, not too shabby.<br />
<br />
Well, let the games begin. For all who dont know or remember, a seal deck plays out like this. You are paired off against the person you are playing first. The two of you sit down and are given your side, light or dark of course. That will be your side for the whole tournament. Next, when the moment comes, you open up all of the lose packs, with all cards turned upside down. You divide out each side so that all the light cards are in one pile and the dark are in another. You then past all of the side that your are not to your opponent to use in their deck. Since the DS2 starters are all the same, there is nothing to do with it. From there, you have 20 minutes to build your deck for that game. After each game, you then get to change out your deck, getting rid of any cards that just didnt work for you.  <br />
<br />
I got chosen to play as the darkside, YEAH!! This side has a much stronger advantage in space, while the light has a stronger force on the ground being able to cancel a destiny with General Solo. What I pulled out of my packs and my opponents packs.CRAP, all crap. The best card I got was an Imperial Barrier. The only rares were Dark Jedi Presence, I Will Find Them Quickly Master, Assault Rifle, and Target the Main Generators. Out of the DS2 starter, which is pre-packed with the same cards, I only changed out 5 cards total in my first game, and then only 3 every game after that. Total crap for this kind of tournament. The good thing though, was that I had good experience in Sealed Deck tournaments with DS2 starters. I knew exactly what to play with and how to play it. The only thing I didnt count on was cards from sets like Tatooine, like Darth Maul, who I know for a fact that Scott pulled. He is a broken character for this environment because no one pulled a 4 ability character for lightside. He just sites at the back door draining for two and no can even battle him all game. BROKEN!!!! Anyway, read on to find out how my games played out.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1 vs. Tommy<br />
<br />
I was excited to play this game, because the last tournament I played in, Tommy had beaten me by 8 in the last game. All my fault, this was a way I could get back at him. First turn started Kessel with Battle Order, Combat Response, and I Will Find Them Quickly Master. I had pulled If the Trace Was Correct too, so I thought it would be cool if I could use the search for a sith probe droid start to always be able to search through my deck. Turn one I got out Saber 4 w/ matching and drew up. He had started Careful Planning to start Tatooine and some site. This game didnt have much happening. There was a total of one battle in space and three on the ground, and that was it. I got out all of my systems and both my sites that I had put in the deck. I put a good set up on the ground, where he tried to fight me a few times. Turn after turn, I just drained, and he lost and drew up. I guess he just couldnt find what he was looking for. He did set up a drain of one on the ground, but he was playing 3 each turn to do it. Finally, after two turns of drains of 8 each. He was done. FW by 25<br />
<br />
Highs  Fast game, fast set up, completely no problems, wish all my games were this great.<br />
Lows  None<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2 vs. Jonathan<br />
<br />
I thought I would have the advantage in this game, because I got set up fast in space, but it turned out to not be the case. I took out the I Will Find them effect and just started with Inconsequential Loses. He decided to take the strategy of no force for me and only for him. He started with the Yavin 4 War Room, then put out the Tatooine: Guest Quarters, and Sullest. THAT WAS IT. Every other location was one that I put out, oh he did convert my Endor. This is how the game played out. I got set up in space on Kessel, but never drained until I could set up on the ground. So I put out two ability 2 guys at my whatever Endor site and said go. He drew up first turn, and on second turn, saved force, third put out General Solo, Chewie, and a Y-Wing, battled my guys and lost nothing because of the canceling of the drain. I put out Tempest 1 and Piett and battled but he still lost nothing. Turn after turn, he would battle me there, but I would just lose the battle damage because I knew I would never be able to get out another ground force if both Tempest and Piett were lost. Finally I found my Endor: Docking Bay and moved over. In space, he had deployed a good 10 ships and would just move them from system to system forcing me to follow with my 6 ships, which were just more powerful. It got to a point where it looked like I had an advantage, draining in space and blocking his drain. He had deployed WAY more cards than me, so that made up for the difference in force lose. But then, he came out with what he used to win the tournament. POD RACING, turns out he had pulled Anakins Pod Racer, the Arena, AND the Epic Event. He looked for it to set up the previous game and it gave him the victory. This game, he had already deployed too much to make it as good, but yet it still came out. I just play out with what I could. Soon after a few key battles, he had a solid drain on the ground and I had committed 6 cards to Pod Racing, I didnt have enough to do anything, so he just drained me out. FL by 18<br />
<br />
Highs  None, the game just didnt seem to go my way.<br />
Lows  Never getting to draw battle destiny on the ground the whole game, him always having the right cards at the right time. <br />

<br />
Game 3 vs. Micah<br />
<br />
I thought I would also have the advantage because I knew that Micah had little experience with Sealed deck tournaments with DS2 having quit playing when Endor came out. My opening hand was CRAP!!! Like one ship and one guy, and all green and red. Drew up, still nothing. Finally got Tempest 1 and put that alien from Tatooine that goes to used pile when hit. I also got a TIE at Kessel and began to drain at both locations. He tried to battle me on the ground, but I made short work of anything he brought to me and it left me at his starting site draining for two and my site draining for one. In space, he battled me a few times at Kessel and then moved to Sullest. I converted his Sullest and we began the battles in space. Battle after battle we killed each others ships. He had gotten really lucky and shot down both my Victory Class ships, leaving me NO way to move my ships away. In time, he battled me off of Sullest and I was forced to deploy some random ship with Ponda Baba so I could not have to pay for drains. All of this took a long time, and time was called right at the end of his current turn, so I couldnt finish draining him. I was draining for 3 on the ground, and 1 in space, while he was only draining for 2 at Sullest. I didnt know time was coming to an end on my last turn, so I had drawn up 5 cards looking for more space to put with Ponda. I had 10 cards and he had 11. So I got a Timed Loss by 1 stupid card.  <br />
<br />
Highs  Owning the ground the whole game<br />
Lows  Getting nothing right in space, horrible draws never getting any ships when I needed them, and losing the game because of time alone by one stupid card. Can you really get any lower than that? <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4 vs. Justin<br />
<br />
This game was perfect. I got out Black 3 and the Reserve Pilot to Kessel. Then put out two ability two guys to my Endor docking bay. He brought General Solo and some guy from Hoth who wasnt a scout and battled. I killed the Hoth guy and he got one of mine. My turn I put out two more guys and killed off Han. No more worries for the ground. I put the rest of the effort to space and got out two more systems and good space at both. He tried to battle, but it didnt do anything. In time I had the advantage all over the table, so he decided he was tired of playing with these cards and just drew up. FW of 26<br />
<br />
Highs  Great draws, no problems,<br />
Lows  Nothing, wish all the games were that fast. What can I say? He was tired of playing in the sealed deck tournament. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there you have it. I went 2 and 2 with one game being by complete crap and the other by bad luck. That is the way of the sealed. I encourage more of you to get some of these kinds of tournaments going. They are a nice change and allow you to play with many cards that you probably never have before. I got to play Ive Got Problem Here TWICE, man I had never even really read it until now. <br />
<br />
Jonathan, POD RACING BOY, went on to win the tournament. But it didnt really matter because he only got one more pack than the rest of us being that there were 10 people dividing a 30 pack box of Theed. Got some good pulls, there was a Darth Maul with Stick, Darth Sidious AI and non AI. <br />
<br />
Last moments were spent showing Justin the Agents deck that he has missed being away from SWCCG for the past 5 months. We also made the final plans for going to Origins. Be looking for a big group of Nashville players in Origins this year. Hoping to take the title!!! <br />
<br />
Hope you enjoyed it. Cheers. <br />
