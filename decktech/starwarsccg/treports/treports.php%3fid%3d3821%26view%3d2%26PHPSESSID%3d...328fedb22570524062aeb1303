Disclaimer:  If you are looking for a nuts-and-bolts tournament report with loads of play-by-play action, move along.  This report will talk about my 4th Origins experience and why this is the best frikkin game on Earth.  &#146;Nuff said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting Ready:  Pre-Origins stuff.<br />
<br />
For me, Origins is a 6-month process.  I usually start calling the hotels just after Christmas, and this year I got shut ou of the Hyatt.  I called the Red Roof Inn, which is 1/2 a block away, and get an awesome rate for the 4 of us.  Who are the other guys, you asked?  Well, it seems like I&#146;ve inhereted my 4th generation of roadtrippers.  Greg Shaw, &quot;Taco&quot; Bill Kafer, and Jon Dansbury, who have been among the most consistent attendees to nearby events, received permission to go to Origins for the weekend after a successful overnight trip for our Regional Weekend back in May.  The four of us started day-tripping to North New Jersey for local events about 6 months ago and it seemed more often than not, the tournaments wouldn&#146;t sanction if we didn&#146;t go (before the 4-man rule).  The guys scraped and saved and were VERY good so that they could go away for the weekend.  <br />
<br />
Prior to the tournament, I was strapped for decks.  I played Light Side LS Combat at Regionals and loved it.  I had been playing Black Sun Boomahs(AAT&#146;s with energy shells), but I was having consistent difficulties with QMC&#146;s inside locations and too few space ships against WYS.  After perusing the V2 cards, I elected to try a SYCFA/Fear Will Keep them in Line deck and with Scott Lingrell&#146;s suggestion (add &quot;Overwhelmed&quot;) the deck was fairly successful overall.  All the good admirals, named ISD&#146;s, and 3 epp Maul&#146;s and 2 epp Vaders and 1 Premiere Virtual Vader (along with 2 Grand Muff Tarkins) completed the set.  <br />
<br />
For about 2 weeks before the event, the guys and I talked about different decks and cards we needed.  We also set up the meeting point to head West.  On a side note, I also had to attend to some family business in Toledo on 7/8, so I told the guys that we would be driving to my sister&#146;s there for the night on the 7th.  This allowed us to stay for the team event on Sunday and not feel like we needed to rush.  Their parents had no problem with this and we made our way to the Rendezvous Point at Exit 26 on the PA Turnpike.  Armed with Moxy Fruvous CD&#146;s, lots of soda, and a hackey sack, we left the Philly area at about 815pm on 7/3.<br />
<br />
We stopped three times along the way to reload caffeine, use the potty, play some sack, and gas up.  In Columbus, we stopped at a Meijer store (open 24/7) to get 2 liter bottles of soda, snacks, and disposable cameras, knowing that we&#146;d be fiscally raped if we tried to get these at the convention center.  We pull into the parking lot at 4:30am and proceed to the registration area.  We played Rummy, Bullsheet, and talked tech while we waited to register.  We got into our room at about 1pm and afterwards we returned to meet up with folks we knew from our area, online, and from other events.  Bill and Greg needed time to plan out there Lord of the Rings event on Friday (193 people... a Decipher record) and Jon and I needed to build Episode I decks. After buying a few other inexpensive board games, I returned to the room to build decks and try to find dinner (nothing open downtown on the 4th of July), eventually deciding to go to the foodcourt.  The guys again retreated to build decks while I did a &quot;Family Business&quot; tournament (Mayfair games..  quick and funny Mafia card game).  After returning to the room and making bed assignment decisions, we crashed between 1-2 AM.<br />
<br />
Around 830am, Greg and Bill awoke (without the torrential flood that was Bill&#146;s bladder at the Regional) and scurried downstairs to get ready for the LoTR Open.  Jon and I slept in, and I awoke to Jon muttering, &quot; Ted...  I need cards.&quot;  I promptly berate him because he saw me with ALL my EP I card sets out the night before, and he should have said something because I keep my cards locked when I&#146;m not using them (BIG Lesson learned a few years ago...).  We get some lunch, and do demos and shop and stuff.  I have a nasty time trying to find ANY singles for swccg, but I finally located a guy who had a &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; and another guy with a &quot;Dioxis&quot; for sale (for DS Combat Deck).  I head over to the boardgame area where I promptly scrub out in the World Championship &quot;Apples to Apples&quot; tournament.  This gave me 5 minutes to run to the card room to play in the EP I event.  Somewhere in all of this, Kim Caton calls me to say that Dave Monteiro is looking for me, and I tell her where to send him.  He is staying with us for nights 2-3, so I give him a key and he comes back to hang out with the DeckTechers.<br />
<br />
Eric Olsen is the SWCCG guru this weekend and he waits about 30 minutes before he decides to start the thing with the 6 people there.  I&#146;m playing DS combat and LS podrace/matching Bravo ships/Jedi assault.  I played a first-time player, Marianne Cummings, who is about my age, and we are joking about the fact that all the other participants weren&#146;t even born in 1977.  She brought some gungan energy shield tech but it was really slow and the DS combat should have eaten it up in about 10 minutes.  I elect to wait and see what she had working and let her try to work her deck through.  We&#146;d take turns deploying and I&#146;d give some advice at times (&quot;..its your control phase..  hint hint..&quot;) and she&#146;d laugh and drain away.  We took about 50 minutes and we were having a good time, but I after a bunch of battles and stuff I just drained her out for a win of about 18 force.  Our second game was more interesting because we matched up again (6 people, remember?).  She didn&#146;t know she needed BOTH decks!!  I offered her my DS deck, because she was familiar with it, and we started playing.  She learned an awful lot in those 2 hours, and she almost beat me with my own deck!!  The funniest part is when she used my DS anti-racing tech against me, and she ended up winning the frikkin race.  I didn&#146;t even think to put my shield out!!!  I was complaining about that for the whole evening (with a smile on my face).  My third game was against Brad Reinhold, who is a podrace machine.  He pretty much spanked me by 20 something...  My last game was interesting, with my lame LS deck vs. an invasion deck. It was sorta close (10-12 I think at the end), but I was more interested in how Marianne was doing with my DS deck against Jon Dansbury.  She was sitting next to me and he was playing Light LS combat.  She was only down to 5-6 cards in her force pile, but she was out-draining him and drawing 6&#146;s and 7&#146;s for combat destiny.  Jon waited and waited, and just when he thought he was done he realized he could place &quot;Boonta Eve&quot; out of play with &quot;I DId It!&quot; to retrieve 4 force.  He ended up outdraining her, but she did not recognize that she could have drained at the Arena since he only had naked 3po there and she had Aurra there I think..  Despite going 0-4, she had a great time and said we were all wonderful, not like the Raw Deal players who acted like total &quot;Richard&#146;s&quot; to her.  (that won&#146;t get edited, will it?)<br />
<br />
Jon and I meet up with Bill and Greg, who have just completed day 1 of LoTR.  GReg went 5-3 and Bill was 109th out of the 110 that stayed for all games.  We waited to see who the matchups were for Day 2, and are excited that Doug Faust and John Lolli are in.  We all walk over to Pete Flamini&#146;s and Chris Gogolen&#146;s room (and 4 other people..) and the guys decide to stay and playtest.  I elected to return to the room and before I can get out the door to do another fun event, Dave Monteiro shows up and we playtest for a while.  He&#146;s kinda rusty, since he hasn&#146;t played a lot this year, but he beats me and then goes out to meet some other DeckTechers. At about 2am, the guys return and we start to plan for bed (new arrangements, although as the old guy I always get a bed). Dave returns around that time and seems a little....tipsy and talkative.  He leaves and comes back an hour later a lot quieter.  <br />
<br />
We awoke at about 8am for the SWCCG open, take our turns in the shower, and head over to register.  It ends up starting at 1115 or so rather than 10, because there are some difficulties with the LoTR qualifiers.  A few people didn&#146;t show or were disqualified and they needed to see if the stand-by&#146;s were ready.  SWCCG draws about 60 people, with Eric Olsen again doing a fantastic job.  Mike Gemme, the Hunter and Terwilliger brothers, Pete Srodoski, and a few others jockey throughout the day at the top table with Mike Gemme eventually winning the final duel against Justin Desai (sp?).  I went 3-3 on the day and ended up being the top-dog out of our room.  Dave dropped after 4 games and Greg got a 6th game bye because there was an uneven number of DS drops after game 5.  Of interest that afternoon, I forgot that EPP Vader can&#146;t drain when I&#146;m on &quot;We&#146;ll handle this&quot; and it threw off my whole strategy.  I kept deploying characters to Cloud City to prevent him from deploying Dark Deal...  but when he put down TurboFett and EPP VAder I Shyed away due to the multiple destinies while letting him drain away at that location.  I manage to get SuperFalcon and Twas Kaa in R2 in Red 5 to Bespin but I only knock out Dengar in P1 and not the Executor (despite having decent destinies in the deck..  not when I needed them, though).  I lose Twas, then he moves ZiMH over and I&#146;m screwed.  I elect to lose the Falcon at the end of my next turn and try my luck on the ground but he drained me out in a close one.  Another game had me figuring out how to stop stupid EV9D9 and a load of battle droids at the workshop.  It took me 4 turns to find Boussh, and when I plopped Corran Horn and QGJ down to take them out, he played &quot;Oh Switch Off!.&quot;  I didn&#146;t see, however, that hiding in my had was a sense combo card.  DOH!!!  He also had a few Elis&#146; in there, and once I saw that I kept using 3po to keep senses in my hand before the game got out of hand..  I won by a couple, fortunately.  Oddly, during game 4 while I am working on my 1-3 record at that point, I realize that I&#146;m at the butt-end table with Jim Li and Mike Dalton.  I never thought I&#146;d see that day!!  Also, what the heck is up with this undercover spy/scout with artillery remote?  someone kept knocking off all my EPP Dark Jedi in one game!!  After about 3-4 games, Kim Caton is complaining that she hadn&#146;t seen the new V cards and was getting her patented &quot;Dagoboring&quot; deck spanked by &quot;Fear Will Keep Them In Line.&quot;  I teased her about playing that &quot;Old and busted joint&quot; while the rest of us were playing with &quot;New Hotness&quot;....  old and busted... new hotness...  Anyways.. I&#146;m glad I finished 3-3, and I rationalize that if I spent more time playing and building I&#146;d do better, so I got what I deserve.  We leave and Lolli had just beat Clint Hays twice to advance into the final for  LoTR.  <br />
<br />
When we all go back to the room to order pizza, garlic nuts, and salad (greek, not tossed), we tweak the decks for the team event on Sunday, then we break out the fun stuff.  I play &quot;Blink&quot; (Out of the Box games) with the guys, only losing twice in about 20 or so games..  then we whip out Apples to Apples.  Another year goes by, and I create 3 more A2A addicts (Bill buys an expansion the next day).  Monteiro shows up later and sits in for most of the games, then disappears again.  By 130am Greg and I are up watching the end of SpaceBalls and Dave returns with a glass from a hotel drinking location...  hmmm....  he goes down to see his local buddies in another room, then returns later and goes to sleep.  <br />
<br />
I get the guys up at around 10am to begin packing, checking out, and to head to the team event by noon.  We are the only team registered at the assigned starting time.  I call Kim to find out that Lolli won the LoTR open (woohoo!!) and a big wad of cash.  Shortly, a few more people register and <br />
we have 3 teams signed in.  Greg ends up 3-1, Bill and I 2-2, and Jon 0-4.  We end up in 2nd place in the team tournament and then say our goodbyes and head to Toledo for the night (where we play more A2A and raid the big freezer for snacks).  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, although my performance was quite average (7-7 for the weekend), I had a great time and continue to enjoy the community that we all create though this game and related activites.  I am excited that LoTR also has successfully created this in their game as well, which is no surprise given the number of crossover players.  Although LoTR is the &quot;new hotness,&quot; SWCCG is far from &quot;old and busted.&quot;<br />
