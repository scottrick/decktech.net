<br />
***PRE-TOURNEY*** (including mini-tr from a putzburgh local)<br />
not much to say here...deck-wise i had a really tough decision (dark side) and a really easy decision (light side). i heard some talk about how walkers was supposed to be good or something, but every which way i tested that deck it sucked so i couldnt play it. then i threw together this goofball cct deck with the unheard-of starting interrupt that lets you take a bounty hunter into hand, use that to get virtual iggy and take mad cards into hand from force pile. of course this would work best with a solid force generation base so i threw in security precautions and 3 emperors to help hold the site...then i realized that force lightning + virtual neural inhibitor was cool and that the cct objective helped my force gen cause out pretty well and then even against throne room i could usually get force gen of 12+ a turn going. still the whole time i knew that this deck was nothing more than a goofdeck and i didnt actually plan on using it at origins.<br />
<br />
so monday june 23rd, the monday before origins there&#39;s a putzburgh local tourney and i go to that, 7 players show which i think is pretty dam good for a weekday afternoon. i use the iggy deck against some kid&#39;s speeders and with all the anti-speeder tech i have in it it totally ownz him but he&#39;s a putzburgh local so im not impressed. then it goes against drew ferguson&#39;s throne room and as expected loses. it played pretty decently tho and his bacta tank was a HUGE factor in the game. my 2 sense 1 alter was not enough to get rid of the tank so i figure if i up the sac count and throw in a shut him up or shut him down i may be able to at least give throne room a game. which is hard to do for any dark deck cuz throne room is disgustingly good. so i win my one light side game in the tourney (i got the first-game random bye), my hidden base flip against drew&#39;s maul hut mains deck, but because of the bye my diff isnt enough to get me any better than third out of seven. hrm. my rating will go up precisely 2 points tho.<br />
<br />
so seeing as how i have been dubbed a &quot;brian hunter groupie&quot; i talk to him on aim and i get put in charge of hotel arrangements for him and his crew. they&#39;re driving in from colorado - 4 guys, 20 hours, 1 chevy prizm. so i do some e-shopping and find this days inn that is like 3 miles from the convention center and little did i know it was surrounded by restaurants, taco hell, white castle, and mcdonald&#39;s, all of which were open till 3 am (or 2:52 am, depending on whose watch you were going by...). friday rolls around and i drive into pittsburgh to pick drew up, we then hit the road westward across the armpit state - ohio.<br />
<br />
halfway there we stop at a gas station to piss and my dam car wont start back up, it&#39;s got a loose battery terminal, and i dont have any tools, luckily this dude comes up and asks if we need help, and im like &quot;alls i need is a dam socket wrench&quot; and lo and behold he has one in the back of his beat-up 88 ford ranger. so he tightens the terminal and gives me a jump start that im not sure i needed but either way the RSmith One is set and we are on the road again. we arrive in columbus around 5 pm, find the hotel rather easily, and meet up with the colorado crew who had been there since 2. i had considered playing in the classic warmup (since i am the undisputed classic champ of ohio), but had nixed the idea a couple days prior and did not even have decks made, so i chill in the room while brian puts finishing touches on his decks for the grudge match with hayes hunter.<br />
<br />
we roll out to the convention center around 6, pay 7 dolla for parking, and get settled in for the grudge match. dont get me wrong, i love swccg like a junkie loves his crack, but i cant just sit and watch people play. it bores me to tears. so i play this guy tom mcgee that came in with brian and he beats on my hidden base with his walkers. actually he won by one. then i go out to dinner with a bunch of ccg&#39;ers, graham neal, chris praskac, mike gemme, and that coonskin cap numb guy and i didnt even know who he was. as we walk around columbus looking for a place to eat, i gradually become aware of what a kickass nightlife columbus has. or maybe it&#39;s just that im used to the shtty nightlife of the cities ive lived in (like pittsburgh). anyway when we get back from dinner brian is finishing hayes off and i see that drew has been watching every single move of every game and im like &quot;dude how can you do it??&quot;<br />
<br />
eventually we end up back at the hotel and i still havent built a dark deck to replace the iggy deck and it&#39;s not looking like im goin to. my light side is throne room and that&#39;s 100% certain. someone says something about virtual bron burs being good against walkers and that sounds like a pretty good idea so i grab the skissors and make me a bron burs (v). tom starts talkin about how mkos beats throne room and im like dude you cant be serious, i used to have tauntaun bones in to help with that match and i found i didnt even need them. and he&#39;s like play it then and i do and i beat him. then i play the iggy deck against someone&#39;s wys (it was either tom or chris fanchi, it was 5 am and i cant remember for the life of me) and the ig deck wins and so im like well its too late to change now. so im going to play CARBON CHAMBER TESTING for origins. god help me. it&#39;s 6 am before i get to the other hotel room where drew is and go to bed. then at 8 i hear a &quot;shave and a haircut&quot; knock on the window so im thinkin it must be one of the guys from the other room, i jump up out of bed and answer the door in my skivvies and its some strange old guy i had never seen before in my life. he looks down at the half-happy morning wood in my boxers and says &quot;oh sorry, thought you were someone else&quot; and walks off fast as his arthritic legs will wobble him. so i close the door and get back in bed but cant fall back asleep. 9 am rolls around and im up and in the shower (tourney reg starts at 10). total hours of sleep for this tournament: 2.0<br />
<br />
nothing else eventful happens that morning, we get to the tourney and fill out decklists and get underway.....<br />
<br />
<br />
***ACTUAL GAME DETAIL BEGINS HERE***<br />
<br />
Decks are:<br />
Light side: &quot;BIG-CL0CK Strikes Again&quot; - throne room buddy<br />
Dark side: &quot;Berserker&quot; - CCT start with Any Methods Necessary and IG-88 (v)<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME ONE<br />
My LS vs John Knapp (1597) Walkers<br />
I&#39;ve never heard john&#39;s name before so the last thing i want to do is underestimate him. i start insurrection combo, colo claw fish, and for luck (v), he starts no escape, imperial domination v, and the walker Effect That Makes Me Lose Force.<br />
<br />
I look in my opening hand and see bron burs v. cool. that and a twix of some sort, dont remember which one. so i go and get a docking bay and drop the twix and pull my grabber. he goes and starts pulling stuff with his objective. i get yoda set up as fast as possible and slide him over to the coruscant docking bay where he would drain for 1 every turn all game long. i either wasnt able or chose not to recoil this game, and john never went over 12 in hand, so i didnt do much hand manipulation, and he got his stuff together to blow up the mpgs eventually. i wasnt too worried about it tho...i had bron burs.<br />
<br />
so after the mpgs were blown we started fighting over the third marker...i had some epp lightsaber guys with lando down there. he shot lando with the atat cannon and played imperial artillery to make me lose a force, i sensed, and he played a second artillery. and i lost a force. that&#39;s the most specific thing i remember from this game. that and i started putting random scrubs at the home one docking bay and transiting them to his non-bg dockbays (executor, death star 2) to drain for more. i eventually wore him down on the ground and im pretty sure i had control of space all game long, so i drained him out for a full win by twenty-some.<br />
<br />
recap: good to see that bron burs was worth switching in. this is how i like to start a tournament off.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME TWO<br />
My DS vs Vikram Bali (1798) Jedi Council Chamber start<br />
so i guess this is like a throne room deck? but with the jcc instead. why do that when there&#39;s speak with the jedi council, maybe he doesnt own any. i should have offered to trade him some. anyway he&#39;s playing like 14 copies of the new flash of insight.<br />
<br />
so im not playing jabba&#39;s prize, that card sucks, so i get a rebel from his deck, it&#39;s chewie enraged. he starts the claw fish, your insight serves you well, and for luck v.<br />
<br />
i go first turn and drop iggy into the prison, take chewie into custody and start pullin cards. i drew sando aqua monster opening hand which was big to cancel his fish and i was also able to use it to my advantage in a couple of early skirmishes. he gets yoda out i guess and starts stocking his hand. i get palpatine to the carbonite chamber and im thinkin i got janus there pretty early too. slide iggy over to join them and i have defense cards in hand. i may or may not have had sec precs (v) out on the chamber as well. pull oppressive shield and use iggy to get some sac in my hand.<br />
<br />
he drops qui-gon with stick at the chamber and i barrier/stunning/whatever to stop that. i go and pull fanfare shield to pull all too easy, use force lightning used to make qui defense value -4, pull epp vader from force pile with iggy and drop him in there, swing at qui and use sniper/dark strike to add 3 just in case i draw two 1s as this deck can do at times. plus i think i had a 1 (executor) on the monster. so anyway qui-gon is frozen and vikram loses 2 force to the neural inhibitor.<br />
<br />
he brings some more ruckus a couple turns later, but force lightning + neural inhibitor = auto-capture lando. at one point i had three captives at the carbo chamber (lando, chewie, and qui-gon). he eventually hit iggy with a lightsaber (remember, iggy = defense value 7 while escorting a captive. and at same site as palpatine, he&#39;s immune to attrition < 7!). but by the time iggy was killed i had pulled all the stuff i needed. my force generation was up and i had palpy+janus draining for 2 a turn at the chamber. also i beat him down for 24 force somewhere and he didnt have a houjix. i dont remember how, when, where, or why it happened but i remember i beat him down for like 24 force and he pretty much had to turn his deck upside down. that&#39;s when i saw all the flash of insights. and i was like &quot;whoa&quot;<br />
<br />
so that sped the game up a little. full win by 20s<br />
<br />
recap: i wish i could remember how the beatdown happened, but i fuggin cant. everything worked really well this game tho, with qui getting all too easyed, and the opening hand aqua monster was huge i believe. cuz fish can wreck the iggy deck.<br />
<br />
so now im up at the top table<br />
GAME THREE<br />
My DS vs Drew Scott (1881) QMC<br />
he starts do or do not/wise advice, squad assignments, and keeping the empire out forever, and gives me corran horn (sweet!) as my rebel.<br />
<br />
im pretty confident in this match because im playing heavy sac, and even though i&#39;ll be penalized for using it, i know that at least the decision of when to use it and when not to use it is in my hands. and im sure ill know when it&#39;s worth it to lose two to do/wise, and when it&#39;s not.<br />
<br />
so i get iggy down first turn as always and pull a defense card (barrier or sleader). he gets some sites out, converts my carbonite chamber, never deployed the sector tho. i think i drew the bespin system opening hand cuz i converted his version in an attempt to force choke him. i started going for space stuff asap with iggy because i knew i wanted to control the system.<br />
<br />
he gets out the 2/1 site that lets him use force to cancel a drain of mine and puts somebody that doesnt draw battle destiny there, i drop maul and something happens, either he played path of resistance or i smacked him up for overflow. dont remember but i do know maul owned that site for the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
so eventually drew decides he&#39;s gotta flip. he puts wedge RSL on his ship up at the system with the xwing cannon and some guys (obi-wan with saber, arcona) at some sites. little does he know that i have been pulling mad space stuff every turn with ig. plus im generating 9 zillion force a turn. so i go and play the free executor effect, drop the ex, drop thrawn, drop guri, drop maintenance cost fett (aka boba-booie), initiate and draw three BD, which when the dust clears gets him for wedge, ship, and 6. and yes i had a sense in case he had a power pivot. so two force a turn in maintenance cost means i will keep the bespin system for the remainder of the game.<br />
<br />
after that it was just a matter of me draining him out. he got leia rebel prostitute onto cloud city to cancel maul&#39;s drain twice, and an arcona to run around in front of me, but i eventually force lightninged that guy. he was only generating 11ish each turn so he didnt exactly have a whole bunch of extra force to pay to drain me. although he did get pucumir out and i had to chase him around and kill him. i think it was p-59 that did the job on pucumir. i put sidious at the audience chamber for even more drainage and eventually sucked his life force dry. full win by 19<br />
<br />
recap: well as hokey as the iggy deck is, it sho&#39; was cool to be able to get all those space cards into hand and drop the massive beatdown on wedge. even if he had waited and put another guy with wedge, NObody can stand up to the executor with thrawn, guri, and boba-booie. one thing that pissed me about this game is i was trying to use the text on his site to cancel a force drain at a related site, then he&#39;s like &quot;you cant cancel my drains&quot; and im like &quot;word?&quot; although it was pretty cool that we were each pulling cards from our force pile every turn once he flipped, that made things interesting to say the least<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME FOUR<br />
My LS vs Hayes Hunter (2296) Walkers<br />
he starts iao combo, mob points combo, and the walker Effect That Makes Me Lose Force<br />
i start the same 3 i started against john knapp<br />
<br />
let me just preface this game by saying that hayes hunter is by far the best shuffler i have ever met. because after i shuffled my deck at the start of the game and presented it to him for cutting, he was not satisfied that it was sufficiently randomized, and proceeded to pick it up and shuffle it himself. when he returned it to me and i drew my starting 8, i saw the following: were you looking for me? (aka 3p0 getter), jedi council chamber, goo nee tay, and bron burs v. not a bad start.<br />
<br />
so i go and very first thing pull dont do that again shield. then i activate and drop the jcc and goo and 3p0. i get a docking bay and after shuffling, present my deck to hayes to cut. he does not cut, but picks my deck up and shuffles it again. upon receiving my deck i use 3p0&#39;s game text and the card i draw from the top of my deck is boss nass&#39; chambers. so now my force generation is pretty much set thanks to hayes&#39; incredible shuffling skills.<br />
<br />
he goes and does his walker thing, pulling stuff during the control phase. i dont remember if he put guys with ability at the fifth marker right away or not, but i do remember that in this game i used for luck v on every turn that i could possibly use it. on the third turn or so i get han chewie and the falcon to hoth, and move yoda out to the coruscant dbay, so i have a solid battle order-proof drain of 2 and 1.<br />
<br />
he drops rendili and puts a lone victory-class star destroyer there with a presence of the force. meantime he&#39;s still setting up on hoth. i go and drop the spiral in front of that with lando scoundrel piloting, stack a good destiny on the fish and battle. he ends up down 6, so he ghhhks. &quot;youre not supposed to be playing that many ships&quot; he says. well now i have a total drain of 5 a turn set up, battle order-free.<br />
<br />
he has been staying under 13 cards in hand, and ive been watching closely as i have the grimtaash in hand. the turn before he is ready to blow the mpgs i deploy bron burs v there, so i lose no force to that. sometime around there i grimtaash lost and get no duplicates, but see a hand STOCKED with space beats. so i put epp luke on the spiral and fly it over to hoth in order to not get beat down.<br />
<br />
at some point he deployed blizzard 4 to the executor docking bay and transited it to my home one dockbay where 3p0 was and tried to trample him. i grab, i sense, i cancel. then a turn or two later he tried the same trick with blizzard 2, stacking the second trample on the grabber shield...and yeah i had another sense. looks like upping the sense count in the deck was a good idea after all.<br />
<br />
he puts zuckuss in virtual mist hunter to rendili, but that dont concern me none, long as i get my rent paid on friday. my drains from earlier combined with the continuous drains at hoth and at the coruscant docking bay are more than enough to put him away.  i may or may not have on the edged for some retrieval in here as well. full win by 19<br />
<br />
recap: couldnt ask for a better start. hard to beat any deck that gets an amazing jump like that. ive now beaten hayes&#39; walkers with trm and brian hunter&#39;s walkers with trm (see pa states TR)....can i beat another walker deck with trm?? stay tuned...<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME FIVE<br />
My LS vs Joseph Giannetti (1978) Hunt Down dueling and creatures<br />
He starts Krayt Dragon Bones v, Bad Feeling Have I v, and IAO<br />
I start the Fish, Insurrection, and Draw Their Fire<br />
<br />
either opening hand or soon thereafter i got speak with the council, so the jcc was out early this game along with yoda. joe spent most of his first turns pulling docking bays with iao and dueling cards with bfhiv. he wmaop&#39;ed for the bridge pretty early, and i got goo nee tay out rather quickly as well.<br />
<br />
he made the first move by deploying blizzard 4 to his endor docking bay and pulling vader (flip his objective), then transiting both of them to the executor dbay. i had to choose between moving yoda over to my coruscant docking bay to flip him back or deploying the obiwan with lightsaber i had in my hand there...i chose to deploy obiwan (flip). somewhere in here i got honor of the jedi out as well which would pretty much prove to be the deciding factor of the game as he never found his no escape.<br />
<br />
but i dont want to spoil the rest of the game for you ;-)<br />
he goes and transits blizzard 4 and vader over to my coruscant dbay in front of a lone obiwan, and plays the circle is now complete epic. cards i have in my hand to deal with this: a jedi&#39;s resilience, escape pod v, and sense combo x2. he has no sac protection out so i attempt to sense....and draw the spiral. successful, circle goes to lost. but he has another one. but i have another sense. i draw for that one....boss nass&#39; chambers. successful, circle goes to lost. it&#39;s his move phase and he has already moved his guys in front of me so he cant run away, so he ends his turn and pays for blizzard 4.<br />
<br />
i go and play sorry about the mess combo to get rid of vader. then i deploy lando, scoundrel and a random forfeit-fodder character (either leia v or chancellor valorum) in front of the walker. my power 13 + two draws to his 8 + one. he has already played two shields and i figure that since he is playing creatures under his starting effect he probably isn&#39;t playing the frozen assets shield so i deploy that on his force pile. he doesnt pull the shield (tho he would later). so i guess he didnt have a ghhhk in hand anyway. he loses a bunch of force and i just lose my forfeit fodder character.<br />
<br />
he spends the next couple of turns regrouping while i drain for 1 a turn at the coruscant dbay and make him lose force to his own visage. i deploy corran horn to the meditation chamber but he puts iggy with gun in there and captures him. he deploys sidious to the bridge and then pulls a womp rat to the coruscant docking bay. the womp rat randomly attacks obiwan...he draws a 7 (making the womp rat ferocity 9), i draw a 2 (on the edge, making obiwan power 7)...so obiwan is eaten and placed out of play by sidious. hrmmm that leaves lando alone there with the womp rat. so i had to drop some other character to take care of the rat.<br />
<br />
eventually i got qui-gon out somewhere which i was pretty sure would keep him on the zero side for the rest of the game. making him lose to his own visage combined with the battle damage from earlier on would be enough to finish this one. full win by teens<br />
<br />
recap: the womp rat was cool, but i cant help but think that that third starting effect slot would have been better used on no escape. because even with the big beatdown i delivered on blizzard 4, the main source of damage to joe this game was visage of the emperor. and i didnt lose much to it at all.<br />
also cool side note: this game was taking place at the top table, andrew howard was casually watching. after the end of one of my turns early on, i said &quot;lose to visage&quot; and we each lost. then joe took a really quick turn, all he did was pull a dbay and some duel cards or something, and he ended his turn, and it was so obvious that we were both thinking about visage but nobody said anything. so then i activated my 10 or so and i was like &quot;good, cuz i didnt want to lose to visage that turn either&quot; and everyone just laughed. i guess we both just &quot;forgot&quot; about it...<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME SIX<br />
My DS vs Clint Hays (2063) throne room<br />
he starts wokling v and two other effects (claw fish and insurrection?) and gives me leia v as my rebel<br />
<br />
my opening hand was pretty sucky this game and his was pretty good. he got a ton of twixes early and was generating mad force from like turn 2 or 3. nonetheless i threw iggy down and picked up leia and started pulling cards into hand from force. my force gen was stagnant as i was not able to get sec precs OR the emperor, and clint revo&#39;ed my dam carbonite chamber to cut off an extra icon. i did get to a battleground first with palpatine at the carbo chamber threatening a drain of 2, and i may or may not have moved iggy over to join him.<br />
<br />
he put obiwan with lightsaber at my audience chamber, i pulled vader from force pile to deal with that. i swing and miss, he swings and misses, i draw battle destiny and he opts not to. obi dies, vader stays and gets furied next turn. we also did some fighting on cloud city and i had maul, palpy, dengar with gun, and dr evazan running around with his quigon, lando, etc. iggy got killed so i had to draw a ton of cards looking for my you are beaten to cancel the fury. our battles on cloud city were mostly uneventful and forgettable, nobody got beat down anywhere, it was just an attrition war for the most part. the majority of the time it was me chasing him around which may or may not have been the smart thing to do but really nothing ever happened over there.<br />
<br />
i had played yab to cancel the fury during my draw phase, so he used flash of insight to get the fury back on his turn. i guess i could have waited and lost 2 to it and played the yab at the start of my turn and then drained him at the audience chamber to try and bury it. but i didnt. so i used his draw their fire to get my yab back and started tracking it, but due to the fact that i was using pretty much all the force i was acitvating each turn to deploy, battle, and move (and sometimes drain), i was never able to get that card back into my hand.<br />
<br />
he played the home one war room and the rendezvous point, then deployed corran horn to the war room and  deployed the home one to rendezvous point for 5 force. then he got kessel out and moved corran up to the bridge and flew home one over to drain for 3 and satisfy battle plan and satisfy fury for the rest of the game. and i had been.....throwing my space stuff away to drains, not counting on a throne room deck playing a battleground system. hrm<br />
<br />
so it seemed like i was actually starting to wear his guys down on cloud city, but we all know that&#39;s impossible against throne room, it never runs out of guys. i was draining here and there on cloud city and one a turn at the audience chamber with vader but losing 2 to the fury. that combined with the drain of 3 at kessel did me in...<br />
full loss by teens<br />
<br />
recap: really this game was all about the fury. it came down early and cost me a bunch of force loss. not to mention he was playing some stuff i wasnt planning on seeing, like a bg system and a rebel barrier...plus i was playing a goofdeck. oh well<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME SEVEN (aka im getting sleepy)<br />
My DS vs Justin Desai (2289) combat<br />
he starts wokling v, another pathetic lifeform, and something else, and gives me leia v<br />
<br />
well by now everyone knows desai went 8-0 in swiss at this tournament, so this game description will be tainted by advance knowledge of the outcome. but as was the case in game six, it was my goofdeck against a good deck, so i had to really work just to make it a game.<br />
<br />
i got iggy down, he got qui-gon down, i put sidious at the carbo chamber, he put lsjk down with qui and gave him a saber. i dropped vader and killed luke and put him out of play, qui-gon lived and survived through every attempt to kill him that i made from then on through a combination of dodge and rebel barrier.<br />
<br />
i drained for nothing, he combatted me for a bunch, i regretted taking out my virtual stop motions, he got some cards back with flash of insight v. full loss by 20some<br />
<br />
recap: well i was expecting to play 4 darkside games and get 4 virtual leias as my prisoner, my early opponents didnt do that so i was 2 of 4. i was hoping in this game to be able to kill qui-gon and put him outta play with sidious but it didnt work out that way...dodge was huge not only in running away from battles but in subtracting from my lightsaber draws. also i know i made a ton of mistakes this game and im not even sure what half of them were but the lack of rest was killin me.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME EIGHT (aka must win to make top 4)<br />
My LS vs Clint Hays (2063) Walkers<br />
he starts off same as hayes did, i start with insurrection, colo claw fish, and for luck (v) which i would forget about for most of the game<br />
<br />
let me just preface this game by saying that never have i done so well in a game i played so poorly in. i also had pretty bad luck, nowhere near as good luck as i had with hayes. although i did draw bron burs v in my opening hand. that makes 3 games against walkers, 3 games i drew bron burs opening hand. nice<br />
<br />
anyway i suspend his mob points and start looking for sites/3p0/whatever, but it takes me a couple turns to get anything good out. about turn 4 the jcc hits the table with yoda and i move him out to the coruscant dockbay and clint is just about ready to blow up the mpgs so i stick bron burs over there.<br />
<br />
i start loading up at the hoth system, with the HCF, crazy lando in the spiral, and corran horn in there too. so i have a drain of 2 there and 1 at the coruscant dockbay battle-order free tho i am paying 4 a turn in upkeep. clint eventually blows up the mpgs with virtual veers on blizzard 1 and i put bron burs in the lost pile. i have never enjoyed putting a card in the lost pile more than bron burs v. i on the edge somewhere in here and get my entire lost pile back. anyway he gets a bunch of guys to the third marker and it looks like this: <br />
blizzard 1 w/veers piloting and at-at cannon<br />
blizzard 4 empty<br />
darth maul with lightsaber<br />
pretty well stacked, right? well i throw a 7 on the fish and track some destiny and put qui-gon with lightsaber at the site and initiate. swing and hit maul. he swings back and hits. draw two bd, one&#39;s a 5 one&#39;s a 1 (gets switched with the 7). maul is forfeit = 0 and there&#39;s 12 in attrition, that means every other dark side card at the site has to GO. what about battle damage, you ask? he drew two BD so his power was 11+8+7 + whatever he drew i cant remember + i think by now he had a victory class star destroyer at the system adding to his power...so something like 30 some power? i houjix. qui-gon + houjix clears out two walkers, veers, and maul in a single battle....sounds like a fair trade to me.<br />
<br />
so yeah after a long time of being drained two a turn at hoth he started putting some ships there, zuckuss in virtual mist hunter and some victory class star destroyers with virtual darth vader as pilot. ds-61-2 showed up also so he was subtracting insane amounts from my battle destiny (and i was drawing 3 per battle with lando and the HCF). one battle i drew a 6, 6, 5....both 6&#39;s became zeroes and the 5 was a 2. so i go from having 17 in attrition to having 2. WTF<br />
<br />
still im getting a steady drain of one a turn at coruscant and not losing any force to that Effect That Makes Me Lose Force because i have honor out and he doesnt have no escape. so i decide that to win this game i&#39;ll have to shuttle all my guys from the spiral (i had put epp luke in to join lando and corran) to the ground and drain him out there. he has already lost most of his ground forces, including most of his walkers (i think only tempest 1 was left unseen), and i have pretty much every card in my deck tracked, including an it could be worse (while he has 3 shields out and no grabber, and an ommni box in lost pile. not to mention i had a sense to back up the icbw). unfortunately this game had already taken way too long and time was called. i count cards in life force, i have 17. so does he. i count cards in lost pile, i have 17. he has 20. timed win by 17.<br />
<br />
recap: sux0r! im certain that if this game were untimed final confrontation style i would have gone on to take the W....but it would have taken another good 20 minutes or so to do. at the end of the game i had another epp qui and another epp luke and hiding in the garbage v in my hand, so i never would have run out of guys. then i could have either icbw&#39;d the drain of one at hoth each turn (and get icbw back with 3p0) or just eaten it. plus he more than likely would have had to pay for it as i would have had little trouble keeping him off the third marker.<br />
also i made a ton of mistakes this game, including but not limited to forgetting about for luck v on several occassions and losing to his first strike one time when i had honor out and it reduced it. oh well. i still dont think we could have finished the game in under an hour, that matchup rarely does in my experience<br />
<br />
<br />
***WRAP-UP***<br />
so i go 6-2 with a timed win which gets me 5th place. out of 40-some. a full win in the last game would have gotten me into the final four instead of joe giannetti, as my differential was higher than his. but no dice. in case you dont know already the top 4 were:<br />
1. Justin Desai<br />
2. Brian Hunter<br />
3. Clint Hays<br />
4. Joseph Giannetti<br />
<br />
desai beat giannetti, hunter beat hays, hays beat giannetti, desai beat hunter. there were two byes awarded at this tournament, due to the &quot;trickle-down effect&quot; giannetti got one and matt scott (whoever that is?) got the other. drew ferguson went 3-3 and dropped, then sat around and watched every last move of the final, while i went back out around columbus with the same peeps from friday night. by the time the final was over i was so beat i dont even remember driving us back to the hotel. although i do remember trying to go through taco hell drive thru and it was a few minutes before 3 and they wouldnt serve us. bastards. then we crashed and woke up at like 2 pm sunday to drive back to putzburgh.<br />
