Well, i finally got around to writing this beast...took a weekend alone in my apartment with nothing but homework to do to make me write this, but hey, at least i&#146;m doing it.  too bad its going to be sketchy...<br />
<br />
anyway, i find out about the Regional back in march or something like that when i first join the Players Committee and hear the word from Doug Taylor a little early.  June 10th, which is perfect because its the first weekend after school is out.  and then later on i hear about the TOC for LOTR (i&#146;m playing lotr pretty seriously also), which appears to be scheduled on...June 10th?!?  i email a few people, throw up a stink, and eventually the director changes it to June 17th, so i am appeased.<br />
<br />
The date approaches, and suddenly my brother (who owns the car we use) gets word that his girlfriend has a piano recital on june 10th.  what is up with this date?  i should mention that me and him are going to college in Ellensburg, a good 3 hours from seattle, and his girlfriend lives in Port Angeles, a good 3 hours on the other side of seattle.  so that means i will have no ride to the Regional...until i call a few good people in wenatchee, specifically Dennis Jeffris.  Dennis&#146;s parents have decided to take him to the regional, so they can have a day in seattle.  they graciously allow me to ride with them, and they&#146;re also bringing Ian Hunter, the other good SWCCG player in wenatchee.<br />
<br />
So mike takes me to wenatchee on thursday before the 10th, where i will stay with my grandparents until the big day.  on the evening of the 9th, i call up dennis and we all head over to ian&#146;s house for a little playtesting.  dennis is trying to build a light side deck, which he kind of does, while i play my hidden base against ian&#146;s walker garrison.  as i recall, he owned me.  then i tested my dark against dennis&#146;s light, and trounced him.  at that point, it was 11pm and we had to get up at 5am in the morning b/c the regional started at 10am.  so we head home, i set my alarm, and at 5am wake up to this blaring 80&#146;s song that scared the heck out of me.  while showering (yes, i am one of the few gamers who takes care of personal hygeine), i decided to use that first line of the song as the title of the tournament report i would write for the regional...but by 6am i had forgotten it and STILL can&#146;t remember...oh well.  anyway, i felt completely crazy for getting up at 5am for a star wars tournament, and later on i was listening to Matchbox 20, and so hit on the current title.<br />
<br />
anyway, dennis&#146;s parents pick me up in their van and we&#146;re on our way...dennis is like half-asleep, but he hasn&#146;t built a DS deck yet so he starts throwing together a Hunt Down on the ride down, and he keeps falling asleep while doing it, it is so hilarious!  what&#146;s even funnier is that it went 2-1...we end up getting to the cardshop around 9:15, and they weren&#146;t open yet, so we had to wander around at this store just down the street that was like a good will or something.  i spent most of my time checking out the books, and found a couple cool ones.  i think i even bought one but can&#146;t remember now.  anyway, dennis found this board game called &quot;Party till you Puke&quot;, and it actually came with its own shot glasses, so he borrowed a few bucks from ian and bought it.  he tells me they still haven&#146;t got around to playing it yet...anyway by now the card shop is open and starting to fill up.  also, just arrived is jason herrin, towing casey merry and rob confer, all from the wenatchee area and well known in wenatchee tournaments.<br />
<br />
anyway, the tournament doesn&#146;t start for like an hour and a half, so we&#146;re all sitting around, filling out decklists and crap waiting for the thing to start, and checking out all the weird swccg stuff the card shop has.  unfortunately i only have enough money to buy an epp obiwan pack, which goes right into my deck.  i brought about a hundred RebelCon flyers with me (RebelCon is a gaming convention i ran in wenatchee that july) to pass out to people so i set those out on the table with all the other flyers doug had provided.  eventually doug taylor gets up and goes over a few things, such as upkeep rules and passing during phases, and then points me and david kangas out as Shadow Squadron members and thus marginally important (nobody notices).  and then we finally get to pairings.<br />
<br />
Oh, my decks...my Walker Garrison, which is pretty solid and wins most to all of its games, thanks to the brand new virtual set 2&#146;s Admiral Motti and Imperial Class Star Destroyers, which are able to hold space pretty well against most decks.  I start YMSYL and Prepare for a surface attack with IAO/SP, and run 2x battle deployment and 2x we&#146;re in attack position now, which i consider ultra-tech for both high destiny and the incredible uses they have in this deck; BD for getting my walkers and destroyers out from reserve, WIAPN for damage and immunity.  they also help me pull off tramples against epp luke and coran horn (who can be a b!tch at the 5th marker).  up until today, i had never played walker garrison in a game, but had never lost either.  for light, i had Hidden Base flip which was cobbled together because i couldn&#146;t figure any other deck out fast enough and wasn&#146;t happy with light side in general (still aren&#146;t).  i think this was one of my Age of Aquaris decks, with the City Outskirts as my bg site...i think i was running 2xmindful of the future to get that and my systems out for the fast flip.<br />
<br />
Game 1: my DS vs. Charles (?) Nguyen&#146;s TRM<br />
I&#146;d never played against TRM before (my area is sheltered, shall we say), so this was a learning experience.  he was using V rycar ryjerd and saitrr kalfas, and using them well.  he also dropped an early Hiding in the Garbage, and kept using that to awesome effect, especially with naked 3PO and how did we get into this mess.  he kept putting his hand back, drawing a new one, then a turn or two later he would tap Hiding, say character weapon, and the first card would be anakin&#146;s lightsaber.  then he&#146;d say device, and two cards later would be obi-wan&#146;s journal.  it was kind of amazing to me, since i could barely track one card through my deck at this point.  he got some guys on Hoth, setting up at the docking bay and working his way across.  and now i know, once somebody sets up good on hoth, i can&#146;t beat him.  this proved true here, and i lost close to the time limit, but not until after he&#146;d pulled off i think 2 on the edge&#146;s, to win by 25.  at one point during this game, Doug had to make a ruling at a nearby game and he didn&#146;t have his rules stuff with him, so i handed him the StG that i was carting around, making me feel important.<br />
<br />
FL 0(-25)<br />
<br />
Highs: got to see a good player do amazing things with his deck.<br />
Lows: first game loss, not the way i wanted to start.  also, every other Wenatchee player except Ian Hunter lost their first game also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: my LS vs. Jason Herrin&#146;s Combat<br />
Neither one of us wanted to play this game, we wanted to play people we don&#146;t see in wenatchee every tournament.  i especially didn&#146;t want to play his combat since its a damn good deck against hidden base.  he puts down a first turn maul, and i drop a first turn epp quigon to take him out for overflow.  nice way to start.  he drops mara jade w/saber, but i got no beats in my hand so i start spreading in space for the flip.  i flip, and he almost immediately drops security precautions and gets out i think the Chimaera with thrawn.  i try to take it out, but no dice and he eventually probes right, on like the last system (either that or the first, i can&#146;t remember), and i lose 8 after carefully explaining to him that the Rendezvous Point is indeed a system.  by this time he had lord vader with saber draining on naboo also, and even though i was packing affect mind shield it wouldn&#146;t affect him b/c vader was his only jedi.  only afterwards did i realize that Ultimatum would have won me the game, but not in time...i was paying to drain since i couldn&#146;t get guys to sites, he wasn&#146;t, he won.<br />
<br />
FL -11, 0(-36)<br />
<br />
Highs: first turn EPP Quigon beat.<br />
Lows: everything else.  I think that to this day i still have not beat Jason in SWCCG tournament play.  just you wait, Jason...<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: my DS vs. Karl Walker&#146;s EBO<br />
Oh what a fun game.  Karl recognized me as the founder of the Rebel Strike Team website, so that was cool.  i counted my deck before this game and came up 1 short, almost panicked, and then realized the last card was stuck to my iao/sp, so i had 60.  we revealed our starting sites and were both kind of surprised...i pointed out that since i had the 5th marker out, he couldn&#146;t deploy the 4th marker as the shield already had an outer boundary, but had to point it out in the glossary to get him to agree (glad i bring all that crap to tournaments).  this was a very close game, but the breaker was when i got Imperial Decree out very early, so EBO was almost a non-issue.  i had booku damage going, and he actually deployed the 4th marker later in the game to give me more marker sites, so that was awesome.  one almost-bad play on my part was waiting for him to deploy the echo db, then dropping mine over it, where he ended up putting lando (i think) and draining me once or twice before i got CHYBC activated.  it really ended up being a battle in space, but all i had to do was hold hoth and i think i made some moves on Kashyyyk also, and ended up winning by 10.<br />
<br />
FW +10, 2(-26)<br />
<br />
Highs: beating EBO, walker&#146;s toughest matchup IMO.<br />
Lows: beating Karl Walker with Walker Garrison...poetic justice or bad pun?<br />
<br />
Somewhere in here we had a meal break, and most of us wenatchee players head to Jack in the Box.  i get my jack in the box usual, 2xJack&#146;s Western for only $2.13, and everybody else is amazed that its so cheap after their $5+ &quot;value&quot; meals.  we talk tech and casey merry starts telling more of his stupid sick dirty jokes.  we head back.<br />
<br />
Game 4: my LS vs. Jerry Walker&#146;s Senate Manipulation<br />
Jerry recognizes me for the RST website too.  Senate Manipulation is nothing new to me, since Stephen Pool and Earl Sessions played it all the time.  however, when i pull one of my generals, specifically gen cal for his stint on gs1, jerry plays scanning crew.  then he plays it again.  just my luck, i don&#146;t have the insight shield.  AUURRGGHHH!!  later on he drops miyoom onith at some docking bay and keeps using her.  so whenever i get a pilot in my hand, i deploy him as fast as i damn well can.  as a result, he usually only finds quigon in my hand and can do nothing about him.  anyway, i end up winning this game, but i remember being scared of his deck the whole time.<br />
<br />
FW +10, 4(-16)<br />
<br />
Highs: beating manip.<br />
Lows: 2xScanning Crew on his very first turn??  crazy...never saw it again though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5: my DS vs. David Kangas&#146;s QMC Miner deck<br />
Battle of the Shadow Squadron members!!  I&#146;m #13, i think he&#146;s #43 or something close.  anyway, early in the game he puts down a miner and premiere obiwan kenobi, and a lone cloud car at a cloud.  i look at my hand and see epp maul and zuckuss.  i activate, got plenty, drop both.  maul hits &#146;em both, actually causes overflow.  zuckuss causes overflow also.  kangas is a little surprised by this double whammy, but while i&#146;m setting up unhindred i continue to smack his setup around a little so he never gets going solidly.  i&#146;m quite happy with myself, mostly because he couldn&#146;t even flip for most of the game.  i end up winning, establishing myself as the dominant Shadow Squadron pilot!!<br />
<br />
FW +16, 6(0)<br />
<br />
highs: beating fellow Shadow Squad member.  Miners die fast.<br />
lows: never got Imperial Decree, i don&#146;t think...would&#146;ve helped against those stupid miners.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6: my ls vs. Neil Timmons&#146;s Walker Garrison<br />
Oh the irony.  Neil&#146;s deck was almost identical to mine except he threw in a cloud sector on Hoth for kicks and dropped the kashyyyk.  weird because we&#146;d never met before.  he starts setting up, gets control of the hoth system and drops POTF there.  with my space force i quickly take it back from him, and drain 3 there and at kessel for most of the game, with Quigon at the City Outskirts.  however, he set up on his 3 hoth sites, and dropped a load of walkers to the city outskirts to stop my Menace Fades....and i couldn&#146;t wipe them all out, so he pulled it off and that was game.<br />
<br />
FL -10, 6(-10)<br />
<br />
highs: seeing again how cool walkers are.<br />
lows: losing to my own frikkin deck!  also, he was wearing a star trek tshirt.  this is star WARS, dude!  lol!  we were joking with him about it and he said he had dressed in the dark and just grabbed the nearest shirt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that was it...I finished 3-3, 6(-10).  David Kangas finished at 6(-9), and as soon as he learned my finish, he was all shouting &quot;I win!! bragging rights on the committee email list!!&quot;  and i was like whatever dude i kicked your @#$% but didn&#146;t say anything...the next day he did email the shadow squadron list and post that little tidbit about him finishing higher than me, so i responded with a report of my game with him, establishing that i am clearly better than him, and it was purely matchups that cost me that 1 differential point that he &quot;beat me&quot; by.  Anyway, Dennis finished 3-3 and Ian went 2-4 after being the only Wenatchee player to win his first two games.  after that...i guess he was out of his league playing at the top tables.  The winners were Keith Watabayashi, followed by Nick Jones and i think 3rd went to either Martin Norris or one of the kitzmans.  anyway, Watabayashi is my horse at DecipherCon, he&#146;ll go all the way, you watch...<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
dennis&#146;s parents for giving me the ride, then buying me a bottle of water during the tournament when i didn&#146;t realize i needed it<br />
dennis and ian for being cool friends<br />
jason and casey and rob for being cool friends also<br />
um...doug for announcing RebelCon and pointing me out as a squadron member<br />
both walkers (unrelated though they are) for recognizing me as the founder of my website (http://www.decktech.net/43)<br />
<br />
i got no slops...<br />
<br />
anyway, that&#146;s it for the tournament, but if you wanna hear about the ride home, read on...otherwise, scroll all the way down and review it.<br />
<br />
dennis&#146;s parents want to get back home, so i hitch a ride with jason herrin down to the ferry docks, where i thought i would be walking onto the ferry and then meeting my parents on the other side.  i was pretty sure i had it worked out with them to be there, but i guess i kind of forgot to mention a time...anyway.  jason has some trouble finding the ferry docks, so i kind of direct him through the streets of seattle once we find the exit, but its been a while and i&#146;ve never actually driven through there before, and the signs are poor...anway, after driving in arbitrary directions while i tell jason that i really do know where we&#146;re going.  anyway, we finally get there, i say goodbye to those guys and am actually a little happy to be away from casey&#146;s horrible jokes.  i get to the ferry terminal, and call my parents, expecting them to be on their way to pick me up at the other side or maybe even already there.  turns out...they haven&#146;t left yet because they &quot;didn&#146;t know when i&#146;d be done&quot; despite i clearly remember telling them how long the tournament would take.  anyway, he balls me out about how i should have called and a bunch of other stuff, and says &quot;its gonna take me 3 hours to drive over there, and its already 9 oclock, and tomorrow&#146;s church and i have to teach sunday school!&quot; and he yells a while and generally sound mad and frustrated.  i&#146;m thinking &quot;gee dad, i&#146;ve been at college for about 3 months now, havne&#146;t seen you in a while, why don&#146;t you GO TO HELL AND LEAVE ME HERE IN SEATTLE THEN!!&quot;  but i don&#146;t say anything.  (you may notice that i have a healthy inner monologue.)  so he finally decides to come get me after all and hangs up.  i go buy my ticket and eventually get on the ferry.<br />
<br />
that ferry ride was one of the lower points in my life.  i keep thinking about how i must have screwed up somewhere to get my dad so mad and everything, and i start contemplating suicide by jumping off the ferry.  after all, its dark and no one would really notice unless they actually saw me jump, and most of the people were inside anyway.  but by that time i was inside too, so i just sat down by a window and looked out wondering if i should really do it.  i mean, i&#146;m normally suicidal to some degree (although i should clarify that i&#146;ve never actually attempted suicide, i just think about it more than is probably healthy), but this time i was pretty damn serious about it.  somehow i made it through the ferry ride, but it took forever...then it was an hour and a half wait on the other end for my dad to show up, just sitting in the ferry terminal.  i tried to play a lotr game by myself, but that just doesn&#146;t work.  eventually my dad showed up, and luckily he had my mom with him or who knows what would have happened.  i mean, its not like i have a horrible relationship with my dad, he&#146;s just....difficult.  anyway, i don&#146;t think any of us talked much on the way home, which was fine by me, and i think one of them eventually apologized for the way he talked on the phone, still not giving up on the whole &quot;you should have called&quot; thing, but they&#146;re probably right there.  anyway, a great SWCCG experience ended rather badly...but i&#146;m glad i got to play in the regional because it really elevated my game and prepared me for RebelCon in July.<br />
