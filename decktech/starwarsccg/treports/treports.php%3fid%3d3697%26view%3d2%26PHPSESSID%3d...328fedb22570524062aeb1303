This is my story.<br />
<br />
A year ago, i was a player rated 1717, i played in a tournament at which the twiggs attended, and hayes hunter, and bastian winklehaus... many good players, and i played them, and i lost to them.<br />
<br />
Since then, i have come a long way.  About 6 months later, i played in freedomcon.  i scrubbed out in day one after holding strong with the top 14 for 6 games.  i just couldn&#146;t get it done.<br />
<br />
another three months later i played a tournament in albany.  again the top players in the world (3 out of the top 5) were there.  i started winning.  i beat hayes hunter, but lost to chris twigg.  then i beat two other 2000 ranked players that day.  i broke 1900.<br />
<br />
this saturday, when i arrived at the coruscant regional, i was rated 1952.  thats a long way in a year; and for not many tournaments in between, thats damn good.  and ive taken down some good players aside from hayes... saturday i would take down a few more.<br />
<br />
<br />
we began playtesting for the coruscant regional the day i came back from school, which gave us about 2 weeks in essence, but throw in a 5 day trip to atlantic city and my college, and it really left us with one week.  so we played our brains out.  <br />
<br />
i knew what decks i would be playing from very early on, a version of justin desai&#146;s senate, which is, without a doubt, in my opinion the best dark deck out there, and is even better with the changes he is now making.  and i decided to play reinholdsd shield puller combat deck, with a few modifications. we tested these mathchups like crazy, mainly against combat, and it went well... this is getting boring, lets make it good.<br />
<br />
fukcin, justin came down to playtest one saturday night and we decided to hit this assumption (college in worcester) bar called leitrums.  it was pretty hot, we got pretty hammered and some girls hit on us... but before that; this girl tried to make fun of justins plaid shirt, but she was wearing all denim, head to toe PLUS she looked liek the fat chick from &#146;all that&#146; that nickelodeon variety show.. the fat chicks name was mary beth vindberg, as me how i knwo that and you&#146;ll get no reply.. but justin was hittin on some pretty cute chick all night and they were all about each other, i just kind of talked to some girls and flirted a bit, so justin takes off with his chick to some shadyd place across the street.  i stumble over there and we decide we&#146;re just gonna take off, well the girl i was talking to comes over, i call her by the wrong name and she gets pissed and bolts... we head to the all night grocery store, pick up some lunchables, fukc with some fat lady behind the counter and bolt home drunk.  yikos.<br />
<br />
well being the good friends that they are, justin and hayes decide to take the trip down to the regional with me, to support me and so im not lontely in the hotel room, that sort of thing.  justin comes up the night before, we go to some party with some friends that happened to be major highschool party, we thought it was gay so we took their beer and their pingpong balls and their cups and played beirut for most of the night before getting lost, talking about anal sex and going down on girls with their period... so yeah it was a fun trip.  we go home, test some more, and then we go to bed... and thus the weekend begins.<br />
<br />
SATURday<br />
<br />
justin and i get up mad early, but we think its made late, so we are scrweed when we find out we got four hours of sleep.  we chill, wait for hayes to show up, and end up gettin on the highway at about 230.  on the way down we mainly talked tech, listen to music, just random shti to keep our mind off things.  the ride down was fairly uneventful, save a stop at mcdonalds and gay junk like that.<br />
<br />
we get down to the hotel at like 5, just in time to catch the celtics game start... we play some scrabble, and i call my ex cause she is 5 mins away and well i have to call her cause if she was in mass and didnt call me i guess id be pisse. i mean we were in jersey afterall right?? so she decides she wants to come by, and when she does, hayes and justin decide they want to eat.. my stomach hurts so me and jaime chill... and i decide i want to sleep with her, so i do... which is a little insane because we hadnt slept together in a few months and we hadnt talked really for a few weeks but whatever right??? we went out for 2 years that kind of thing happens.  so just as we finish, im laying on top of her and the announcer starts yelling about  the celtics coming back after they were down 27, well i jump up, run to the window and start yelling to hayes and justin out the window, which she gets pissed at cause shes lying naked in the bed, theyre not around so i just watch the game and she gets kind of mad at that, but you know it happens... so as you know the celts win, and then hayes and jstin come back, the ex leaves and we finish the night off playing cardsd, scrabble and watching major payne, friends and the untouchables.  pass out around 230.<br />
<br />
pretty uneventful day right???<br />
<br />
SUNday<br />
<br />
FIRST OFF let me tell you about my shirt... the afore mention EX, her dad gae me this shirt from a roadrace when we started dating, it was the run for the roses 2000 in denville nj, so naturally if i have a denville shirt im going to wear it to a regional in denville right??? just remember denville 2000, this is the hottest tech shirt ever created.<br />
<br />
wake up around 9, shower up; head over to denville... only we dont know the adress, which sucks  becuase wed like to find the store.  so after being lost for about 20, we  pull over to dunkin donuts and call hayes brother and he gets us the number, i call the story and we get there with plenty of time to spare, plus donuts and soda.  36 players were there, lots of names like chu, twiggs, praskac, you know.. good players, i knew it would be stiff competition, but i was confident, andd justin and hayes reassured me.  so it would be fine.<br />
<br />
for decks i played dark senate, for light i played combat. you know this.  after some talking and scouting and crazy stuff like that, my entourage settle down, pairings get called and im matched up against mike robinson.<br />
<br />
game 1 - my dark senate vs mikerobs combat racer.<br />
<br />
well, i set up my deck the way it is supposed to be set up, senators out, effects out, set up my ddrains, and then i just took it to him.  i did a maul beatdown twice, once vs luke and obi (because he had panaka over with quigon at one site and i was NOT about to F with panaka), and topped him for a bunch, then he moved quigon over and i did it again.  after those two huge beatowns, he had about 12 cards stacked on the race because he coulnt finish it in time... and before he could resolve the race i played limited and yeb yeb to get him dead even though i hadnt retreived yet with squabble and i had 3 senators left on effects, i just didnt want to lose the 6 to the race and let him get 12 cards back. so i won by 22.<br />
<br />
fw 2 (+22)<br />
<br />
highs - all of them<br />
lows - none of them<br />
other - it was good to get a decent win. i am ready for game 2 now.<br />
<br />
so after i find out what ppl are plaing an i relax a little, check out this picture justin drew of me during game one with the clock and everything it was hot.  so justin fills me in that mad ppl are not playing wys and qmc, most are playing combat, for both sides, not a lot of dar ksenate, which is both surprising and dumb.. i knew then that my dark deck was the most solid and my light deck had some tough matchups with dark combat coming up.. we&#146;ll get to those later... <br />
<br />
game 2 vs ted pazyznnzncncnznncsysnss  aat droid wac @#$% aobs.<br />
<br />
you can read his tr for most of this game, not a battle took place, i drained inside naboo&#146;s core and he did some st uff on the outside, mostly ddrains of one which i either cancelled with rebel leia or lost from hand with no big deal.. literally nothing happened this game, he dropped ig, i forgot to zap him for about 3 turns, then i finally did and it wasnt a problem to begin with and it wasnt a problem afterwards.. when all was said and done i won by 30.<br />
<br />
fw 4 +(52)<br />
<br />
highs - all of them<br />
lows - i frickin forgot about zapping! thats bad, i also deployed things i didn thave to... i was not happy.<br />
others - wwhatever i was up there in the standings, seocnd to be exact.. i play chu.<br />
<br />
game 3 vs chu&#146;s light combat<br />
<br />
well this game was sort of a repeat of the first game only i could not get lott dodd really quickly, so i set up the senate with out him, set up my drains and set up the beats, i beat him down for 16 and 12 overflow.. after that, it dint matter what i did becuase he didnt have much left in his deck.  to be honest this was the hardest matchp the deck had up to this point justin said, and i won the game by 18.<br />
<br />
fw 6 (+80)<br />
<br />
well three games are over, i just beat the number 3 player in the world.. things are looking up.. i chill a lot with justin, we get food and stuff. at one point he calls doorknob on me and we run about a half a mile just to find one when there was one in the store.. many ppl thought we were talking about decks during this time, but rest assured i had no breathe left.. we talked about decks later and i got matched up next vs bri twiggs dark combat<br />
<br />
game 4 vs bri&#146;s dark combat.<br />
<br />
i race, he plays the racer so im like FUKC.  but everything was all goo cause i won the race.  we had combats going the whole gmae, trading off, it was basically combats the whole time, i sensed some of his crap.. he was really classy thogh, i thought he had there is not ry shield and i was losing forces to a sense, and he stopped me.  i mean hes a good firend and i wouldnt have held it against him if he didnt stop me, but he did and tha tmeant a lot.  so we&#146;re combatting and combatting its going to time and i have him... only i mistrack and draw a 2 and a 3 in a combat i initiate and quigon goes byebye with four from my reserve F UKC.. so now we&#146;re at astale mate cause we both have two sevens left that arent activated and we are just drwawing them.. well it goes to time and i have four cards to his five, so i combat, draw two artoo in red seens, he draws two phantom menaces... i choose  two zeros and give him the full win. cause im nice like that.<br />
<br />
fl 6 (+75)<br />
<br />
highs - eh, playing well against a hard @#$% matchup<br />
lows - stupid mistracking with quigon killed me badly<br />
others - justin wasnt happy i gave him the win, but whatever hes the only person there i wouldve done it too and it didnt affect me later, so its all good.<br />
<br />
eh since that game went to time i had no free break and i get matched up vs chris twigg, whose playing the same deck as brian.<br />
<br />
game 5 vs chris twiggs combat dark,<br />
<br />
so this sucks cuase i just lost to this deck.. i dont let myself get defeated.. i knew it woul be hard, but i had to do it if i wanted to q ualify for worlds, so i never gave up.  early on i d rop cards and drain, like leia with stick he puts down maul, i put down luke and battle with leia, run luke run, luke dies, i miss with the swing, shti sucks.. so for some reason he doesnt zap leia, he battles her and sends her to used THIS IS THE KEY FACTOR IN THE GAME.  after this i start combatting and im winning huge!  okay so im up by so much, and hten he just starts coming back, im losing comgbats, its bad news.. hes messing up my tracking, i wasnt drawing enough to get my sevens... but what i do draw, leia and her stick.. so hes got like 4 cards left, but i cant do any damage, so i ddrop leia and stick vs. maul... and battle... stupi you say?? yes it is.. i swing... this is it.. ive been getting @#$% destiny all game, but if i get rid of maul i win.. draw a 4 (ote) draw a 6 (jedi luke) mauls dead.. only he hits me and draws a 6 so i lose leia and 9 FUKC!  but im able to stay in the game and drain out with yoda!  and i win by 11 in a matchup that we didnt think id win!<br />
<br />
fw 8 (+86)<br />
<br />
ummm somewhere here i did the math wonrg.. i dont know how.. but whatever from here on in disregard my diff..  this is taking longer than i thought so im just gonna get to game 6.<br />
<br />
game 6 my dark vs. praskacs light.<br />
<br />
okay so again i set up senate and drains.  he tries to b attle me but he gets taken out and it aint no thing.. hes draining me at the 3/2 naboo site (he starts throne room) and i cancel it, meanwhile im draining, yeb yebing away his only han/chewie/falcon (hot!) and pinging and limitiding... no battles take place although i tikkes&#146;d for mauls strikes a turn i took maul with lott dodd, i just knew i had the game without battling and i ended up winning by 15.<br />
<br />
so im 5-1 with 90 diff.. we wait for the games to end and chus is 5-1 with 91 diff<br />
<br />
its me and chuin the finals.. but i get an uncut sheet of r3 and a bye into worlds... plus 74 rating points, which is huge. here is the finals<br />
<br />
well game one he wanted the rematch vs my ddark... i won the game easily lik ethe first, with beatowns and ddrains, it was exactly the same.. 18 cards.. i had a shot at being regional winner... and i fukced it up...<br />
<br />
game 2<br />
he deploys executor and gets him at endor draining, i drdop han/chewie/falcon and bravo fighter, hes like theyre each plus one, so i pay the two, an battle.. dont break  executors immunity... but... fukc becuase of the +1 deploys... i onyl have two cardsd left.... bye bye han chewie falcon... bravo fighter vs. the world... he drops chirnoonoo and thrawn, battles i dont e ven know if he imp commands all i konw is that i lost 23 cards after i lost the bravo fighter.. after that i still had da shot if i pulled quigons sber out of lost, which i forgot to do, and he just combatted me out because i was trying to pull off an edge instead of track sevens for combat and i lost by  19 FUKC!<br />
<br />
oh well, the bravo fighter debacle is now one of the worst moves in the game ever!!! so i&#146;m known for something right??<br />
<br />
after the tournament me and justin broguht hayes and chu to pizza hut and we got the six person family meal o rwathever it is.. but i flirted with the manager to get us free bbreadsticsks and stuff, and she was all smilin at me so we get out in the car after i had told her to call me when shes in mass, cause she said she loved it there, i run back in and give her my pager number as a joke and email... so that was funny we all got a kick out of that..<br />
<br />
the car ride home i thought was gonna be awful cause it was so late (9 by the time we left, but it was fine.. we talkeda bout ramapo, and fcon, and dcon 2k and how we all got into the game, our first tourneys our first pulls, just mint shti like that and it really makes me love that this game is making a comeback.. this game is going to do it.. its going to come back.. sure the vcards suck, but this is the best ccg ever.  lord of the rings sucks balls, ive played it, so does magic and pokemon and starwars THECARDGAME and all the other jank, this is where it is at and i love this game and i miss it, but at the same time its nto gone, because we got 36 ppl at this regional and it was the hottest S ever.<br />
<br />
so we get home at like 1230, and that chick from the pizza hut im&#146;s me the second i get on.. mad freaky.<br />
<br />
anyways this tr is too long for a  time in the game when ppl are not going to read it.<br />
<br />
baroni didnt come so mrs baroni was not that involved, although one day i went over to get cards and steve wasnt there i talked to mrs baroni for like 30, just about steve and how hes hanging with the wrong crowd and im like just nodding my head and thinking about how much i love her.. i talked to her on the phone tonight when steve wasn thtere, we had a nice ten minute conversation.. im getting there, im getting there.... someday i will french her.. and it will be beautiful... someday.<br />
