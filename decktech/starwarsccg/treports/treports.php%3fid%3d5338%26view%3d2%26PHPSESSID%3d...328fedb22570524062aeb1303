Long time I was looking forward to the Tierfon championship in Gent, at the Gito campus and that&#39;s in Belgium. A lot of prizes, a good place to play, food, drinks, space outside, everything a Starwars player needs (only the weather wasn&#8217;t that good). The top 2 will receive a bye for day 2 worlds but more important, the winner may design a card for the future virtual set!<br />
<br />
I came alone, since my local buddy Kris was too tired to come. A total of 12 players showed up and Tania de Pauw was the judge. I was feeling a bit sick that morning and wanted to concentrate on the games, the food and selling cards so I took only a few notes. I am a bit late with this report, but I have two extremely busy weeks behind me.<br />
  <br />
<br />
My decks.<br />

LIGHT. I start with Endor , two battleground sites and four effects with the new interrupt: Rayc ryerd(V), Civil disorder(V), Insurrection/Aim high and Strike planning. The rest of the deck consists of mains and toys with very high destinies (I play with Luke JK and three Bionic hands) and cards that you may expect (SATM, gift of the mentor, the force is strong with this one, etc&#8230;). I also have a small package of capitals to hold one system.<br />
<br />
DARK. Also on Endor, three battlegrounds and four effects Combat response, IAO/secret plans, Ability 3x(V) and Security precautions(V). If the opponent gives me nothing, I start with 9 force turn one so my mains and toys can battle immediately if necessary. To defend space I played bounty hunter ships with matching pilots and a Sith infiltrator.<br />
<br />
Both decks have the same strategy, hold one site and the system to drain and there are plenty of other cards left to battle the opponent away.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On to the games! <br />
<br />
Game one, my light against Quentin Buchkremer (I will call him &#8216;Q&#8217; from now on) Invasion.<br />
<br />
Q deploys three effects: First strike, Begin landing your troops and Inconsequentional losses. My civil disorder is cancelled so I deploy DTF instead. Both first strike and DTF are on table, this is interesting. My opening hand is good, A Luke JK, Bionic hand(V), Luke&#8217;s lightsaber, Flash(V) so I could play a tanked Luke directly from the beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
Turn 1. Q deploys two droids from reserve deck, I draw one card with Thrown back(V) and to my utmost delight its the Tantive IV(V). I fetch general Calrissian with strike planning on his turn. Q&#8217;s pilots were in his force pile. My turn I attack the lone battleship with Tantive IV(V) and Calrissian, deploy the flash( I wanted to see my destiny, there was still a zero floating in my deck). I initiate battle, Q looses two force (DTF and First strike), I retrieve two for free (Q forgot to deploy the secret plan shield), the flagship is lost without overflow and I draw up.<br />
<br />
Turn 2.Q deploys some more droids on another of his sites and draws up. I fetch Lightsaber proficiency. Q hasn&#8217;t enough space in hand to attack Tantive IV. My turn I drain for 3 on his system, attack the two droids at the throne room with my tank Luke, Q looses again two force with DTF and First strike and has a 7 for total battle destiny but it isn&#8217;t enough to break Luke&#8217;s immunity (<9!!) so the droids go to the racks and Luke stays on table.<br />
<br />
The game is already won, Q has a big lost pile, all his droids are on the racks and the cards I draw are good. I&#8217;m already playing in function of force differential.<br />
<br />
Turn 3. Q deploys some more droids at the other site and my turn he is drained for 6. He has no cards in hand and I attack his  four battle droids with Tanus spijek(V) &#8211; another four force loss for Q and wedge RSL, initiate battle, two force loss for Q and Wedge survives, I shuttle him (the battle took place on an exterior site) to Tantive IV(V) and draw up.<br />
<br />
The next turns is me playing cat and mouse with Q, on the last turn I attacked five battle droids with Quiggy with saber (I had to pay 4 extra force, SSA 1015 was there), SATM the most powerful droid and Quiggy is lost without overflow, there was a flash on table and Quiggy goes to the used pile. There is no card in my lost pile, Q has 1 life force left and draws up, making an end to this game. I had a good opening hand and the luck with a turn 1 Tantive IV(V), not much is to be learned from this game.<br />
<br />
FW + 36, total 2 (+36)<br />
<br />
Three other games were won with +28, trouble for Tania to make the pairings :-) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2 my dark agains Sven Gempel&#8217;s Bespin deck without objective. Sven is a newbie that won his first game against his buddy (also a newbie) and plays a deck without shields, starting cards etc&#8230; so its instant meat.<br />
<br />
I won&#8217;t write details about this game, I just deployed my stuff and drain fast, when Sven realizes I&#8217;m ahead in the drain race his lost pile contains 25 cards and I&#8217;m draining for 7 a turn. One or two battles occurred, the last one I have 16 overflow and the turn after its game.<br />
<br />
I am in first place but the tough opponents still have to come.<br />
<br />
FW + 29, total 4 (+65)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3 my light against Cedrik Vanderhaegen (I will call him &#8216;Cé&#8217; from now on) Cloud city without objective.<br />
<br />
No more newbie this time but an opponent that usually wins against me. However, Cé didn&#8217;t play for quite some time nor playtested his deck so I was quite confident that I had the advantage in this game.<br />
<br />
Cé started with the new starting interrupt, deploys Bespin, Cloud City, Downtown plaza and four effects: We&#8217;re the bait (V), IAO/secret plans, weather vane(V) and alert my star destroyer (V). My opening hand is not that good, a lot of red cards but I have naked Threepio to recycle quickly and a Goo nee Tay to hold of Cé a bit.<br />
<br />
Turn 1. Cé, deploys a docking bay and draws up, he was looking for some cards. My turn I deploy also a DB, Threepio and Goo nee tay. I can start to recycle cards and have an annoying effect on table. I want to battle him and use Civil disorder(V) to its complete strength. I have again a full tanked Luke ready to deploy and The force is strong with this one is also in hand (I am waiting for Vader).<br />
<br />
Turn 2. Cé deploys TMNLTC and a free Executor with Piett, Lando(V) and the AO battle deployment. Via the AO Blizzard 4 is deployed from reserve deck with EPP Vader. As a response to my Goo nee tay, Bad feeling have I hits the table. That&#8217;s gay. My turn I go for it and deploy Luke (he is costing 11 force now) in front of Vader with his saber and Blizzard 4, lightsaber proficiency and bionic hand (V). Battle is initiated, I play the force is strong with this one but it is sensed. Whoops, didn&#8217;t see that première card coming. Vader misses the swing on Luke. I try to saber Vader; my first destiny is a 1 (Obi-wan) and I play Jedi levitation(V) to redraw and take Obi in hand but it is sensed. Ouch!!!! He&#8217;s got two sensed in hand and I didn&#8217;t play the shields!! D&#8217;OH!!!! My second weapon destiny isn&#8217;t high enough to hit Vader. We draw battle destiny, I have a 6 but Lando reduces it to 5 (very crucial) so Blizzard 4 satisfies attrition. I keep Luke in front of Vader because I still have a SATM and I hope to lure Cé in a trap because he is in a good position and my hand is poor in good characters. I recycle cards with Threepio and find another SATM and some capitals in the cards I draw. I deploy the do or do not shield as well. Nothing is lost yet. Suddenly Cé reminds me the first sense was useless because I couldn&#8217;t draw more than one battle destiny due to the AO. :-/<br />
<br />
Turn 3. Super Fett joins Vader, battle is initiated and I hope for a SATM on Vader plus a poor lightsaber swing from the dark lord. However, the card least wanted is played; it&#8217;s a hidden weapons(which is immediately grabbed). Cé draws a 4 but reduces it to 3 with Lando(V), Luke is captured and Vader seizes Luke, ending the battle. Vader shuttles with Luke to the Executor. There was no force left in Cé&#8217;s force pile so he looses two to recycle Boba. My turn I must find the super Falcon ASAP but it&#8217;s in my reserve deck, I still have a chance to bring down the Executor.<br />
<br />
Turn 4. The drain in space starts, Cé fortifies the Executor with Chiraneau and captain Bewil (really a very good choice). My turn I deploy two capitals with Calrissian to Endor. I&#8217;m sure Cé has an imperial command in hand thanks to Bewil so the executor is safe for remainder of game. The cards I draw really suck.<br />
<br />
Turn 5. The Executor drains and starts to play hide and seek with my capitals. Cé judges the situation correctly and is waiting for my characters to deploy on the ground. I deploy a quiggy with saber, savrip (the canceller was in his lost pile so I can still come back) and draw up.<br />
<br />
Turn 6. Cé alters (!!!!!) savrip, and I forgot to deploy the wise advise shield. That&#8217;s really badly played from me, I had an escape pod (V) in hand. Quiggy is battled away without overflow.<br />
<br />
The next few turns the characters I deploy are battled away and I loose quite some force to first strike and draw their fire (I deployed that one too quickly) but I found some flashes and with good tracking I manage to keep destinies 6 and 7 on top of my deck and fetch back characters from my lost pile. I&#8217;m just a bit too low on life force to reverse the situation on the ground. If I can satisfy battle plan, I can drain for free and drain faster than Cé but its coming too late and at the very last turn I shuttle Lando to the ground. Lando is battled with Veers(V), I loose two force and Lando wins 4 against 3 (woohoo) but my life force is dropped to 4. I have a flash and Tanus Spijek (V) in hand but I decide not to go for another joke and draw up.<br />
<br />
FL -18, total 4 (+47)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4 My dark against Bart Ouwehand MWYHL (wise advise, wokling(V), the way of things)<br />
<br />
I know my deck has a very good matchup against most decks, but a jedi training deck isn&#8217;t. I have to play very carefully from the beginning and hope that Bart is making a few mistakes. My opening hand is quite good, I have Vader, his saber, Emperor and Maul in hand.<br />
<br />
Turn 1. I go for a quick start and deploy Maul in the infiltrator on the Endor system for a quick drain of two early game. Bart has a bad opening, Luke is in his force pile. Bart tells me the odds for such an opening are 8%. By telling me this, I sense Bart is very skilled with his deck and I shouldn&#8217;t count too much on mistakes.<br />
<br />
Turn 2. I keep going for a quick start and deploy choke Vader with his saber on one of the Endor sites, a drain of five is ready. Bart deploys Luke, jedi test 1 and draws up.<br />
<br />
Turn 3. The drain of  five comes trough but Bart stays calm and knows what cards he has to loose. I keep fortifying Endor and go for a total drain of 4 each turn. On his turn, Bart completes more jedi tests and deploys naked Threepio and a flash.<br />
<br />
Turn 4. I drain for 4. I found a Janus to recycle cards and want to deploy a DB. There isn&#8217;t one in my deck but I did it to see what destinies remain in the deck. They were all high and I draw up my whole force pile and have almost all my characters in hand. Janus is my best mate now, because I start recycling high destinies and try to track/find the cards I need. Bart could check my reserve deck and knows that there are a lot of 4, 5 and 6&#8217;s in my deck. On his turn, every time he completes a test he retrieves 3 but he also starts tracking flashes so his retrieval compensate my drains. I want to annoy him and find my two ommni boxes.<br />
<br />
Turn 5. I do the Janus&#8211;Emperor-force lightning combo and Bart decides to grab force lightning. I haven&#8217;t played an omni box yet, so I keep them for a surprise. Bart is completing his test 4.<br />
<br />
Turn 6 (or was it 7, don&#8217;t know anymore but this isn&#8217;t important now).<br />
I drain for 4 again and EPP Obi, Quiggy with saber and an X-wing cannon hit the lost pile. I fortify Endor with Zuckuss in mist hunter(V) and some passengers for forfeit fodder. I&#8217;m hoping the cannon isn&#8217;t coming back too soon and play omni box to shuffle his entire reserve deck at the start of his turn. It was a good move because it slows him down for another turn because he has to re-track everything for completing jedi test 5. Unfortunately, he deploys projection of a skywalker on one of my sites so the drains go slower for me and Bart saves crucial time. <br />
<br />
Turn 7, 8, etc... I keep playing with Janus and ommni box but Bart keeps playing very professional and manages to complete jedi test 5 with a 7 as destiny so the battling will start and it will be very though for me to win, but it&#8217;s still possible. All my high destinies are in my reserve deck and I have powerful cards in hand.<br />
<br />
I will from now on not talk in function of turns (there were an awful lot of them) but I&#8217;ll give some important events that I find important enough to be written.<br />
<br />
1. Zuckuss is shot in space by Red leader in red 1 with an X-wing cannon. I can&#8217;t retrieve him back so Maul has to stay cloaked to keep the drain pressure and I have still a Bossk in shoe ready. Nevertheless, the force loss starts to hurt me. <br />
2. Somewhere at turn 20, Sidious attacks Quiggy with saber at the Naboo generator core (the 3/2 site). I did it to retrieve a character with civil disorder but I completely overlooked Sidious&#8217; gametext, which gave me the possibility to place Quiggy out of play.<br />
3. I am not attacked on my Endor sites and that&#8217;s the best thing Bart could do. Boba was waiting there and he knew a hidden weapons could be lethal. Vader was never attacked by Obiwan because Bart knew a circle could be played.<br />
4. One time, I cancelled an ICBW with its worse and activated my whole force pile for an extra damage of 16. However, I should have read the rules before because the extra damage is considered as a force drain bonus and it is cancelled by jedi test one. After the explanation, I skippd directly to the end of turn phase &#61514;<br />
4. On the very last turn, there was a home one with Corran at Kessel with a cloaked Maul in front. I went for my very last chance and attacked Home one with the infiltrator and Bossk in shoe. I knew the destinies were high, so if home one hits the lost pile I can still win the game. I tracked a 5 but didn&#8217;t know the second destiny. It was a 4 but my destiny draws are each -1 so with 7 attrition Home one stayed on table and I give up the next turn. What I forgot was the attrition being reduced with 2 becauseYoda was at his hut. I should read the cards better next time :-/ <br />
<br />
FL -20, total 4 (+27)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5  My light against Jean Pierre Buchkremer (I will call him &#8216;Buch&#8217; from now on), a Tatooine deck with the new starting interrupt with powerful aliens and quite some V8 cards.<br />
<br />
Buch deploys two battlegrouns extra and 4 effects: All wrapped up (V), Power of the Hutt, Jabba&#8217;s influence(V) and Desilijic tattoo (V). I didn&#8217;t play this deck before, but I know it was quite popular at the Raltiir championship (Germany) one month ago. I have to play quickly otherwise Tatooine is lost for me and Buch will certainly win the drain race. My opening hand sucks, all (and I mean ALL) the cards I download are in my hand (the docking bays, Bionic hand(V), Lightsaber proficiency, Calrissian) <br />
<br />
Turn 1. Buch deploys a lot from reserve deck, and deploys his characters to the Audience chamber. I am allowed to activate 5 force and draw 5 cards with Thrown back(V). Normally such a bonus is enough for me to clear away the Audience chamber and completely disrupt my opponent&#8217;s strategy but the 13 cards I have in hand are all complete crap, a zillion of useless red cards and nothing to recycle them. My turn I draw up some more, still crappy cards but at least I can deploy a tanked Luke and naked Threepio so maybe I can attack next turn.<br />
<br />
Turn 2. Buch suddenly downloads Evader/Monnok and plays it used, leaving me with 8 cards. Here I was lucky because the lost version would have cost me 8 cards and the game. I can still play the tanked Luke and have some space. Buch also deploys Jabba&#8217;s space cruiser on Tatooine. My turn I go for it, I attack Bane Malar and another alien and miss the lightsaber swing on Bane Malar. That&#8217;s a crucial event because at the end of the battle Luke is captured (all wrapped up(V)) because my destiny draw is again low.<br />
<br />
Turn 3. Buch continious to fortify his sites, it becomes very difficult to take it over again. On my turn I attack Jabba&#8217;s space cruiser with Tantive IV(V), general Calrissian and I also have a Savrip on table. I know he would react with a free Mist hunter and Zuckuss but its important for me that Zuckuss is on table rather than in his hand. I could still battle away my opponent&#8217;s space in two or three turns because I found flashes and with naked Threepio I could start tracking. Buch lost a character and I keep my ship alive with Savrip and have a Spiral in hand.<br />
<br />
Turn 4. Buch deploys a lot of space, Tatooine occupation and battles me, I can&#8217;t keep my ships alive with the Savrip and draw poor destiny. Space is lost for me. Also, Buch manages to check my reserve deck and now he knows the cards I need are in my reserve deck. On my turn my remaining ship flees to Endor but I know few turns later both systems will be lost for me. I try to attack on the ground, tracking flashes back with Threepio keeps me alive but my lost pile becomes bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
The decisive action was the deployment of Molator(V) by Buch so my SATM (which I just found) are useless and I can&#8217;t do anything useful. Playing without an OOC/TT turns out to be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
My very last turn I found a Leia bikini with Anakin&#8217;s saber, deploy her to the audience chamber, cancelling opponents ability there. With a SATM next turn I could still hope to free Luke and hope for a battle with overflow next turn but Buch deploys Maul in front of Leia and I give up immediately.<br />
<br />
FL, -26, total 4(+1) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6 My dark against Pierre Libois, MWYHL with Wise advise, The way of things and Battle plan/draw their fire. I have a normal opening hand.<br />
<br />
The first turns of the game were almost exactly as in game 4 so I won&#8217;t give any details.<br />
<br />
However, I harass Pierre&#8217;s Jedi testing with early Ommni boxes and it&#8217;s clear that shuffling my opponent&#8217;s deck pays off. I played more tricky now, I deployed my cards in such a way that Pierre battles me instead of saving force for retrieval.<br />
<br />
Four events were decisive.<br />
<br />
1. I deployed Janus and Dr. Evazan on one of my sites and waited for the battle to come (I was sure he would try to take out Janus). Pierre initiates battle with Quiggy with saber, we both loose our characters without overflow but more important Darth sidious was alone at another site, this time I remembered his gametext and place Quiggy out of play.<br />
<br />
2. Next bait was Vader, Obi-wan comes to battle him but I played my circle and Obi is out of play. His resilience was in his lost pile, no chance to save Obi. The old man joins Quiggy at the far side of the table.<br />
<br />
3. I left a lone Zuckuss in Mist hunter(V) at the Endor system. Pierre comes with HCF to battle him away, his battle destiny draws are not enough to break my immunity (what I was hoping for) and I didn&#8217;t draw battle destiny (battle destiny is optional!). Pierre wins the battle, I eat quite some overflow to keep Zuckuss alive at the Endor system but more important there was no way to forfeit HCF and there was no force left to pay the upkeep so placing HCF out of play was the only available option for Pierre.<br />
<br />
4. Three crucial cards out of play and I keep harassing Pierre with Ommni boxes (Pierre grabbed something else), The destiny draws for jedi test 5 are 1, 1 (an Obi and Quiggy both already out of play, LOL) and that secures victory for me a few turns later.<br />
<br />
I scored a 3-3 and can kiss my virtual card goodbye. One thing I learned today is that METAGAME is more important than it seems, knowing what decks are going to be played and what cards are popular that&#8217;s what counts. I finish at 5th place (last year also) but I hope next month at the Europeans I won&#8217;t place 13th again ;)<br />
<br />
J.P. Buchkremer and Bart Ouwehand end both first and at 21h they didn&#8217;t want to play a final confrontation.<br />
<br />
J.P. is earns the title of Belgium champion because he has more differential and Bart may design a virtual card.<br />
<br />
For the rest not much to say, I made a poor performance and unlike previous tournaments (see my reports from last year)  J.P. was really outstanding today, played very skillfully,  made the right deck choice so he deserves his title 100%.<br />
<br />
The hotdogs were good, I sold some cards and my boosters from Theed, Jabba&#8217;s palace, Cloud city were awful. My Endor booster gave me a perimeter patrol (I&#8217;m happy it wasn&#8217;t an Ewok glider foil) and in the DS2 booster there was a Lord Vader :-)<br />
<br />
The final result:<br />
<br />
Buchkremer Jean-Philippe: 10 (+94)<br />
Ouwehand Bart: 10 (+91)<br />
Buchkremer Quentin 8 (-24)<br />
Vanderhaegen Cedrik: 7 (+65)<br />
Lambrecht Stefaan 6 (+16) ---> me<br />
Engeser Franz-Martin 6 (+11) DROP<br />
Van Steenbergen Jimmy: 6 (-10)<br />
Libois Pierre 5 (-5)<br />
Gempel Sven: 4 (-35) DROP<br />
Holtmann Andreas-Jochen 2(-95) DROP<br />
Aubertin Xavier: 2 (-118)<br />
Blijkbaar ben je weer op de vijfde plaats beland :c)<br />
