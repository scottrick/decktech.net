<br />
I didnt think that i would get to play in another tournament until coruscant after my last trip to CT <br />
<br />
with the kasshyyyk crew.  But since i realized i had this saturday off i figured i&#146;d hit up one more <br />
<br />
tourney in the current environment and try to take home the foils because the competition would <br />
<br />
be scarce.  boy was i wrong.  <br />
<br />
I was the first person to show up, and noone else arrived within the half hour.  Then i went to the <br />
<br />
parking lot to get something out of my car (i was really just bored and walking around) when Mike <br />
<br />
Pistone (madskills) and Matt McGann and their other bridgewater buddy showed up.  As of midnight <br />
<br />
the night before, they werent coming. and if they didnt, we wouldnt have had a sanctioned <br />
<br />
tournament.  so we lucked out.  A few minutes later, a few worcester guys showed up, followed by <br />
<br />
the schiemer brothers.  So that gave us eight and we were pretty pumped that it was sanctioned.  <br />
<br />
Jared, the normal td wasnt there and johnny rivera (the kashyyyk scrub) showed up to run thefirst <br />
<br />
half.  We&#146;re all playing a huge Raw Deal game when Steve Brentson comes and screws EVERYTHING <br />
<br />
up giving us 9 players, a bye, and creating more competition for us all.  but thats not always a bad <br />
<br />
thing is it???  <br />
<br />
I pride myself on knowing that while i have not broken 1800 i still maintain my status of RATINGS <br />
<br />
BUSTER.<br />
<br />
MUAHAHAH.<br />
<br />
So after tooling on everything with my sick roaddogg deck we start the tournament.  I get paired <br />
<br />
against Matt McGann, whose rated about 1575 if i am not mistaken, which i probably am.  I do know <br />
<br />
however, that he is not above 1600.<br />
<br />
Oh and if youre wondering where the competition is, here ya go: Hayes has no decks made, steebo <br />
<br />
was in long island, justin desai is a wimp and wont steal his own car from his dad, eric hunter was at <br />
<br />
gencon as well as RI and NH state champs who will usually make the trek to this tourney.  All in all <br />
<br />
noone was around.  which is why there are no antics with steve or hayes.  this is the first tournament <br />
<br />
ive been to without anyone in a very long time. <br />
<br />
But if you wanna read about some hotness before the TR (which is usually the case when ppl read <br />
<br />
my tr&#146;s to my understanding, half of my reviews are &quot;pre tourney was awesome&quot;) so here we go. <br />
<br />
So my parents are away this week, and my sister decides to have a party.  Now i know most of you <br />
<br />
have read about my sister and what my friend&#146;s (justin, hayes, klema, etc) have said about my sister, <br />
<br />
and i take that, and multiply it by 2340923843, becuase she has TONS OF HOT FRIENDS.  and i got <br />
<br />
wicked bombed playing beirut (you homo&#146;s outside of new england might call it BEER PONG).  And <br />
<br />
to top it all off, tons of girls passed out in my bed.  But i was already passed out and i missed them <br />
<br />
passing out next to me, which sucked.  But to know it happened makes it THAT MUCH BETTER.<br />
<br />
And if that&#146;s not enough, thurs night at steebo&#146;s his mom was teasing me about how everything i eat <br />
<br />
is very plain so i tell her that im gonna have her take me out to dinner so she can buy me the most <br />
<br />
EXOTIC and expensive meal i could think of.  its all about the word exotic baby.  <br />
<br />
Also, the night before the tourney, i stayed up talking to twigg about clint getting dq&#146;d and about <br />
<br />
this chick he&#146;s dating. all in all its not bad and here we go with the games.<br />
<br />
Game 1 My RANCOURT vs McGann&#146;s WYS Solid <br />
<br />
So wys is a good deck to play with my rancor, becuase ppl stay on tatooine and i can eat them <br />
<br />
more easily that way. I drop my dbay behind the Palace and wait for him to deploy to the ground, <br />
<br />
which is a mistake b/c from now on i should try and take the cantina.  Once i got the palace set up, <br />
<br />
i just waited.  Early on i stole someone, i think it was talon.  He has artoo/threepio out so he drops <br />
<br />
melas to battle 4lom (who was escorted) and i had to lose 4lom.  he dbay transited back towards the <br />
<br />
cantina and i got screwed.  he beat me out of space (which sucked) but i couldnt pull enough ships <br />
<br />
and its really not that difficult to get rid of WYS ships without weapons, even with dengar out.  So <br />
<br />
bacially he sets up huge drains.  And i go after him and take out chewie and epp luke before having <br />
<br />
to make my long and lonly walk to the audience chamber.  I get to the dungeon, drop my guys off, <br />
<br />
and drop the rancor.  i end up eating luke and talon for a 30 force swing, but his drain of 6 a turn <br />
<br />
was killing me, and i was paying to drain. in retrospect i shouldve just dropped the virago or <br />
<br />
something to tatooine to kill battle order, but it did me in.  i had four force left when he had two. <br />
<br />
which means i can only get him down to one, instead i just dropped epp fett to screw around and he <br />
<br />
won by 2.<br />
<br />
0(-2)<br />
<br />
Highs: eating two guys.  hanging in against a tough WYS deck<br />
Lows:  LOSING BY TWO AFTER EATING TWO FRIGGING GUYS<br />
<br />
Brentson lost his first game to mike sciemer, which is very respectable.  Pistone won i think. and <br />
<br />
thats all i guess.  but that means i would have to play brentson, a man i&#146;ve lost to three times and <br />
<br />
even titled a tournament report about.  <br />
<br />
Game 2 my TEN NUMB SUPERSTAR vs Brentson&#146;s BHBM mains.	 <br />
<br />
So BHBM normally means sac.  sac kills klammrodt style qmc.  Even with WYS as common as it is, i <br />
<br />
still had a feeling that Brentson would be playing SOME sac, enough to screw me over.  He was, but <br />
<br />
this game never saw any of it.  I set up in space early.  He pretty much stayed away.  At one point, <br />
<br />
he went to drop Chimera w/ thrawn to bespin, but he changed his mind and went to carida to satisfy <br />
<br />
battle plan instead.  He then put bosssk at cloud city with chirnoonoo as forfeit fodder. and was <br />
<br />
holding the CC Dbay (his) with emporer, janus and guri, with a presence to boot.  i had the three <br />
<br />
other sites oN CC with leia, luke and Lando + Melas respectively.  He drops Marquand (?) ozzel and <br />
<br />
veers to luke, i path to leias site.  hes draining me for a ton and its time to make a decision.  Do i <br />
<br />
go to carida to stop the drain of 1 but give up celebration?  do i go after bossk and give up <br />
<br />
celebration again.. or do i block the drain of 3 with epp luke and path over.. ill do the luke thing.  <br />
<br />
so i move him over.  But i also drop Ten Numb in his ship to cloud city in front of bossk.  This is <br />
<br />
funny because i know brentson is scared of the superstar, he has shot down his executors before <br />
<br />
and he didnt battle me once at cloud city.. and they were there for a few turns straight.  Brentson <br />
<br />
knows i play rapid fire.. hes a smart man.  So luke gets battled.. i play path MIKE YOU CANT PLAY <br />
<br />
PATH... the dbay is not interior.  so i swing at palps, hit, draw a 4 for destiny.  i lose luke and two.  <br />
<br />
then he moves marquand and janus in front of leia.  That is waht cost him the game.  I activate, <br />
<br />
drain, retrieve, and track the six i flipped to hit the emporer with.  he says use janus&#146; ability.  then he <br />
<br />
tries to play Omni box.. but its my action.. and i Sorry about the mess janus.  (it didnt matter my <br />
<br />
destinies were 6,4,5 respectively).  so i drop dash, path over lando and battle.  i shoot marquand, but <br />
<br />
only have destiny enough for one (not two as lando&#146;s text dictates) and i draw the 5. marquand and <br />
<br />
11 please.  That puts him down to one force.  he drains me for two on his turn, i lose the last two in <br />
<br />
my hand and he draws his last one so i cant retreive.  Fw +???<br />
<br />
4(+8)*<br />
<br />
Highs: Winning against brentson, hes good.<br />
Lows : Being so excited, that i forgot to count for differential... first time thats ever happened to me.<br />
<br />
So that sucked, cause i mightve beaten him by more than ten, but who really knows. at most it was <br />
<br />
15, but still.. that five differential at least, plus the one i couldve added from the last game.. that <br />
<br />
wouldve put me in second for the tourney...but i dont end up in second.. read on.<br />
<br />
Game 3.  My QMC vs Pistone&#146;s HD JIZZ<br />
<br />
HD podracing sucks, but as long as i dont drop luke and obi, he cant hurt me right?  WRONG.  I get <br />
<br />
a terrible start.  i hold bespin, and he drops the deathstar first turn and is getting tons of force.  i get <br />
<br />
corran to the holothatre, he chases corran with epp vader.  i path around the death star.  hes draining <br />
<br />
on cloud city (i lost one site early) and couldnt get things going by only holding one site.  So <br />
<br />
basically he was draining me for more than i was draining him.  Late game i FINALLY got capt han to <br />
<br />
the death star to drain, but it wasnt enoough, and there wasnt anything i could do.  he wrote a TR <br />
<br />
about this game, and his is probably better as he won and i lost.  so i lost by alot, i think it was 25.  <br />
<br />
it sucked.<br />
<br />
Highs: none<br />
Lows : Many<br />
<br />
So brentson had the bye, and now i have the bye.. which sucks so i play raw deal with johnny rivera <br />
<br />
and whoop @#$% with the road dogg.  He has to leave and i take over running the tourney with help <br />
<br />
from brentson. becuase hes the only one there that has actually run one before.  the round ends, <br />
<br />
and i get paired playng my Light.<br />
<br />
Game 5 My Ten Numb Superstar vs. Rod&#146;s DS deck that i cannot think of.<br />
<br />
In all honesty i cannot remember what this kid was playing.  i am at the beach writing this, and i got <br />
<br />
drunk the night of the tourney, so it escapes me.  read the strategy for ten numb superstar..and thats <br />
<br />
exactly how this game went.  he did no damage to me really.  i mean he did some with drains and <br />
<br />
stuff, but mainly i just drained and retreived, i was in control the whole game, i was retreiving tons <br />
<br />
with my edges, and he didnt really do anything.  Oh yeah!  this kid was playing endor ops FLIP with <br />
<br />
scout troopers and bikes and SCOUT BLASTERS.  which is why i won.  he drained me a lot early <br />
<br />
game, but he couldnt compete with my drains.  (i again lost a site off the top second turn).  and i <br />
<br />
just won easily.  no battles took place.  i think he tried to come up against me with his ships once, <br />
<br />
but they wouldve gotten toasted so he thought better of it.  either way.  ten numb and dash held the <br />
<br />
system like no others could.  I win by 25 exactly.<br />
<br />
Highs: QMC still works, and it shows<br />
Lows : Hitting early drains.<br />
<br />
So its game six, pistone and scheimer play for first place, mcgann and brentson play for second, im <br />
<br />
in the number five spot, but i can bump it up b/c im not playing anyone that was doing that well <br />
<br />
that day, which helped.  <br />
<br />
Game 6 my RANCOURT vs. Someone&#146;s WYS Solid.<br />
<br />
SO again my rancourt plays wys.  He drops dash early to kessel.  and i go take him out with guri in <br />
<br />
ship, dengar, zuckuss, and virago sans xizor.  this was turn four.  so i only had to bite the huge drain <br />
<br />
once ( i controlled the other).  And i smack him out of space and own kessel and tatooine the rest <br />
<br />
of the game mainly.  On the ground i obviously own the palace, but he is podracing, so i lose 6 <br />
<br />
there.  So now its time to eat guys.  i start battling with jodo and ig, and ig takes ecc chewie from <br />
<br />
the cantina to the palace all to get eatin by my rancor.  which he does late game for the 20 force <br />
<br />
swing.  after that he couldnt recover because i owned space and he had a solid drain at the cantina, <br />
<br />
but thats only becuase i lost 6 characters in the podrace...which was gay.  but i win the game and my <br />
<br />
diff hits 50.<br />
<br />
8(+50)<br />
<br />
Highs: eating chewie, the best to eat for swing purposes.<br />
Lows : Not winning by enough<br />
<br />
So brentson runs over to see by how much i won by (he won by 33!!!!)  and his diff was 6 higher <br />
<br />
than mine (1 from game 1, 5 from the game with brentson).  so i coulda took second, now im stuck <br />
<br />
with fourth and i get some packs of Death star 2.<br />
<br />
Now in milford, entry fee is two packs.  i was able to convince a couple kids to buy ds2 packs so <br />
<br />
empporers and lukes could be pulled.  only three of us got these packs, and i did the prize support <br />
<br />
so that there was one stack with two ds2 packs.  Whichi  got, because i got to pick fourth (behind <br />
<br />
two tourney foils and three packs of tat) and i pull a jedi knight luke! which is hot.  i also won <br />
<br />
twenty beans on a scratch ticket and pulled edge&#146;s finisher that very day.  and then of coures i beat <br />
<br />
brentson and those girls passed out on my bed.  a good day??? i think so. <br />
<br />
So that concludes my tournament report. sorry if this isnt as cool as the gencon reports, but hey, i <br />
<br />
try.<br />
<br />
