Director Rich Buckner. 15 participants.<br />
<br />
Well, it's the first post-ECC tourney and time for some fun with the new cards. Rumor had it that each participant would score an ECC pack of their choosing, so everyone was excited.<br />
<br />
My LS - My Test 3 Deck - it's on Decktech, check my member page. A few very minor revisions, maybe.<br />
<br />
My DS - A slightly revised version of a deck called DS Beats that I saw on this site and thought might be fun to try. Basically just a deploy and battle kind of deck.<br />
<br />
I showed up early to grab a couple ECC boxes (Iggy and Bubble Boy), and put some of those in my DS deck. As always I will refer to my opponents by their first name only. Here we go....<br />
<br />
Round 1, game 1<br />
My DS vs. my friend Nick's LS Bothan Ops.<br />
This was a horrible start to the tourney. I had lent Nick the Local Uprising Objective and about 6 Bothawui Ops, and I knew his deck pretty much inside out. So I was sure I'd crush him. I started Hoth: Ice Plains and Combat Readiness for the 3rd marker, he started Both &amp; Swamp. My opening hand has EPP Vader and Tarkin in it. Sweet. So I figure I'll just deploy to the 3rd marker, put a PotF there, get the Executor to Both later on, then drop Battle Order and he won't be able to keep up. Boy was that a mistake. Here's what happened . . .<br />
first turn, I drop Vader to the 3rd marker for a drain of 2, draw my last one (still no Twilek or Battle Order). He starts doin the ops thing, gettin sites out - doesn't deploy any characters yet. 2nd turn Tarkin and Evazan to the 3rd marker - that site's mine. He gets another site out, drops EPP Obi and an op. No biggie, right? I'm still lookin for my Battle Order. Next turn I finally draw a Twilek (I also have Blizzard 2, DS61-2 and Evax in hand by now). He gets another site under control with EPP Luke and an op. I activate 3, play Twilek for my Battle Order - not there! I take PotF instead - deploy it on Both, put DiPO there (I coulda put a TIE Scout there and been safe, Nick has no space in his deck). Draw a couple - planning on dropping Blizz 2 next turn. His turn, he Alters BOTH my PotFs (and my friggin Oppressive Enforcement isn't out either). Where's a Monnok when you need one? Surprisingly, he doesn't get a third op out, just puts a couple chump 2/2 guys (Red Leader and Dutch) to the sites he already controls. My turn. I drop Blizz 2 w/DS-2 and Evax to Obi's site, battle, he loses op. Draw....another Twilek! By now I know my Battle Order should be on bottom of my deck, since it wasn't there when I activated 3 a couple turns back. His turn, he deploys a Bacta Tank, then deploys an op/buddy pair to 2 other sites, flips, then moves one op back to Obi's site, and one op/buddy pair to the site with the lone buddy (his buddies are all 2/2 guys). Then he slides EPP Luke and Dutch over to join Obi, and my Blizz 2 is facing Luke, Obi, Red and Gold Leader, and a friggin op. So now I'm draining for 2 a turn. I activate 3, Twilek - and Battle Order's not there. Then I realize - I took it out in favor of a Crush The Rebellion!!! Boy was I ticked. The rest of the game was downhill, he beat up on Blizz 2 and I couldn't draw anything to back it up with. I eventually struck up another drain with Djas at the Forest Clearing, but so what? He outdrained me - he even forgot to drain TWICE and still won. Full loss by 6.<br />
0(-6)<br />
<br />
The good: Drawing Vader/Tarkin in my opening hand.<br />
The bad: Foolishly wasting them on Hoth, and not remembering that I had taken Battle Order out.<br />
The ugly: I lent him the most crucial cards in his deck!!!<br />
<br />
Oh well, on to...<br />
Round 1, game 2.<br />
My LS vs. Michael's DS JP drain bonuses.<br />
This game was over quick. He started the ol' Expand the Palace trick, but I drew 3 Dagobah sites in my opening hand. Completed Test 1 (on BoShek) 3rd turn, rendering Gailid and Entrance Cavern Text useless. Plugged up Audience Chamber and Jabba's Palace with PoaS and he was draining me for nil. He got very frustrated and stopped taking turns, so I just completed Tests 2 and 3.<br />
I got my two CC sites out (Carbo Chamber and Lower Corridor), deployed my compliment of EPPs (except Obi, I use premiere and saber) along with Yoxgit to retrieve the Landing Claws I had tossed to his few random drains early on. He tried to deploy Ortugg to the Corridor, I said no-no. So he dropped EPP Boba and J'Quille there instead. Obi and Co. crushed em. I drained him for 5 a turn on CC, he was draining for nothing on Tatooine, and he just drew up. Full win by 31.<br />
2(25)<br />
<br />
The good: 3 Dagobah sites in opening hand. 'Nuff said.<br />
The bad: Mike got kinda pissy with me when he wasn't draining for anything on Tatooine.<br />
The ugly: He's a relatively inexperienced player, so it's not exactly the greatest victory.<br />
<br />
Round 2, game 1.<br />
My DS vs. Chris's Throne Room/Nudj/no Revo.<br />
He starts the usual Throne Room/Farm/Swamp, gets a Nudj to each site first turn, Goo Nee Tay too, draws. Bubo was in my opening hand, so I send him to the Swamp for a little snack :) I draw, he sets a Frozen Assets on my one card in life force, gets EPP Obi and Han to the Swamp for a big fat drain of 1 (and to kill poor Bubo).<br />
I absorb the drain of 1 each turn while setting up a beatdown squad in hand and waiting out his constant barrage of FA's. Finally he runs out of FA's and I drop V/T along with Blizz Scout and DS-3 piloting to take on Obi and Han. We battle back and forth, he gets EPP Luke and Battle Plan out, I end up taking out all his characters but Luke (whom I deploy He Is Not Ready on) I have V/T left (I had forfeited Vader in one battle, then deployed another one next turn), so I move em to the Farm and drain there. Put PotF on the Death Star (only system on table) and the Devastator there so I can ignore Battle Plan. He has Luke run away to the Throne Room, but he's losing constantly to He Is Not Ready because he doesn't want to send Luke out to face his daddy. I win with drain of 2 at Farm, 1 at DS, and 1 for HINR. Full win by 15.<br />
4(40)<br />
<br />
Round 2, game 2.<br />
My LS vs. Dan's Hunt Down<br />
He starts the Hunt Down stuff and Bad Feeling, which slows me down getting Yoda out. For the first 5 turns (no kidding) all he does is draw, complaining about how he couldn't find a site. Finally, 6th turn he deploys the Tat: Docking Bay, Choke Vader there, and flips. By now I'm about to complete Test 1 (on Melas). I complete that, set up for Test 2, he backs Vader up with Tarkin, Tempest 1, and like 6 Navy Troopers. He's forgetting to make me lose to Visage, and after the first time of me saying, 'OK, I lose one to Visage' I decide that if he can't remember what his own frickin cards do it's his own fault. I don't lose a force to Visage for the rest of the game =/<br />
I PoaS his drain at the DBay, he spreads to the Lars' Farm, which I PoaS too (at this point, the TD walks by and says, 'I hate that card!!'). I deploy my CC sites, Luke, Leia, and Han to the Corridor (Yoxgit too). He Elises V/T over from the Lars' Farm, but for some reason duels me without initiating battle first (??). He draws a 4 (which I Glance) and a 6 (d'oh!), I draw a 6 and a 2. I subtract 1 from his 6 with Test 3, his total is 12. Mine's 13. He says he wants to cancel my 6, I say no way cuz he didn't initiate battle first. Sucks to be him - Vader's dead, he has to Elis Tarkin back to Tat so he doesn't get his ass kicked next turn. I get Jeroen and Obi/Saber to the Holotheatre and that's game. Except late in the game I Traffic Controlled my hand, he played a Limited Resources on my turn. I figger, ok, 2 force, no biggie. His turn - another LR. Grrr. My turn - ANOTHER LR. Grrrrrrrrr. Pisses me off. I still win, full win by 11.<br />
6(51)<br />
<br />
The good: Luke beat Vader in a duel, at the CC: Lower Corridor nonetheless!<br />
The bad: This kid needed some serious instruction in how to play a Hunt Down deck.<br />
The ugly: Those damn Limited Resources.<br />
<br />
Round 3, game 1.<br />
My DS vs. Justin's Test DoS to 3.<br />
He starts MWYHL, Goo Nee Tay (that card is too broken). I draw He Is Not Ready and a Twilek. I don't Twilek for BrokCon right away b/c he may not be training. As soon as I saw Test 1, though, I Twilekked for BC and put HINR on DoS. He never completed it. I got Tempest 1 and Blizz Scout 1 to 3rd marker, but Obi, Luke and Han show up with a Bacta Tank/Savrip combo going on. So I had to give up Hoth, but I semt Blizz 2 and a PotF to Mos Eisley (which he deployed) for a drain of 3. He whipped out Battle Plan, LiMF and Kessel, I Laterally Damaged that @#$% and hit him with the Bus. LDamage was on Dagobah (the only other system at the time) so he moved there and I had a drain of 1 at Kessel for a while. He was constantly draining me for 2 at 3rd marker and 2 at Ice Plains, I was draining 3 at Mos Eisley, 1 at Kessel. Then he drops Kiffex and Coruscant, and a Leader to each. I take him on at Coruscant with DiPO and the Thunderflare, but he Savrips the damage (where's my frickin Masterful Move?). Next turn GL gets some back-up in the form of some Gold Squad Y-Wings - DiPO goes bye-bye, LiMF gets fixed and flies back to Kessel. Ouch. We're both still draining on the ground, but he's draining for more in space, and I'm running out of ships. I drop the Dev-Dev to Coruscant, but Savrip comes through once again. Luckily his Savripping allows me to Limited Resources him for 4 (I play with ONE copy of that card), but he still drains me out.<br />
Full loss by 4.<br />
6(47)<br />
The good: It was a good game, with great battles and lots of fun involved. It was cool how the focus shifted from ground to space and we got to engage in both arenas in one game.<br />
The bad: I felt stupid losing since I had effectively shut down his testing, but he beat me without it.<br />
The ugly: Bacta/Savrip.<br />
<br />
Round 3, game 2.<br />
My LS vs. ???'s Hunt Down.<br />
Here we go again with another Hunt Down deck. He starts Strategic Reserves, so I know he's doin the Navy Trooper thing too. This game was a blur, I knew the tourney was far out of reach and I was tired of playing against Hunt Down decks. All I remember is he Disarmed Luke (I was searching frantically for my Bionic Hand, thinking I may actually get to use it for something other than destiny), then dueled him, but I had stacked some good draws and he hadn't. I Couraged for an extra destiny, he Focussed, and Disarmed Luke *tied* the duel with Vader. I soooo wanted to beat him with a Disarmed Luke!! But it was not meant to be, and Vader moved off to duel Obi, who lost. That was pretty much the game. Full loss by something.<br />
<br />
The good: Nothing. I'm so sick of Hunt Down.<br />
The bad: Disarmed. I'm surprised more Hunt Downers don't use that card.<br />
The ugly: WHY couldn't Luke have won that duel?? That woulda been so cool.<br />
<br />
So I finished 6th out of 15, got the Lando ECC pack and a couple packs of WB Premiere (nothing). The DS deck I played either sucked, or I was unfamiliar with it (or both). But from now on, I'm makin my own decks. And including Battle Order =/<br />
