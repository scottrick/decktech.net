I conferred with my good chums, Hunter ronedog Roney and Zach Lonelybari Tartell, and we all agreed that it would be our prerogative to go. Plans finally fell into concrete when I called up the Hampton Inn and made reservations. Unfortunately, I forgot to take into account the fact that I had baseball practice not only on the Friday we had to leave, but the coach had to schedule practice on the Saturday. Now, there isnt much I love more than baseball, but Star Wars CCG is one of them. This one would take some creative lying. I told my coach I had a boy scout event on Friday night, and then fell ill with food poisoning on Saturday. Brilliant. <br />
	The fourth member of our party, Greg Shuman, backs out to play in the Syracuse TOC. On Thursday night Zach, Hunter and I all went to Dennys to participate in the hallowed ritual of eating a brownie. For those who doubt, it still works a little.  At 3:30 on Friday were heading out of Watertown NY, in the Crimson Pirate Mobile aka the Toyota Sequoia. Listening to the iPod and talking tech, we make good time down I-81. No construction, no traffic jams, no wandering animal in the road. I also get to check off another state in the states that Ive been to-Delaware. In fact, I have a funny story about our entrance into Delaware. The absolute first sight we see is a man, pulled over on the striped area of the off ramp, urinating profusely all over the road. Finally, we roll into the hotel at about 9:45 and turn on HBO and try to construct Zach a Dark Deal deck for the Classic tournament. That doesnt turn out well as we didnt bring a Bespin or a Cloud City. We finally decide on a pile.  Then comes the tough part: filling out deck lists and naming decks. I decide on Fur Burgers for my dark side ala NPH, and Chunky Milk and Yellow Snow for the light side. Zach decides on a pair of Julius Caesar lines for his- Cry Havoc and Let Slip the Dogs of War. Hunter pulls some names out of his ass, something like Grumble Cakes and Four Horsemen.<br />
<br />
	Waking up, we try to find a Waffle House in the phone book. No can do, so we just eat at the hotel. We leave at about 10:20ish and find that Renaissance Gaming doesnt open until 11, so we head to the nearby Burger King. There, we find Tim Simon and introduce ourselves as the people he met at the NJ Open last year. Zach rambles on and on about retarded tech for about 15 minutes before we decide to tell him to shut up.  NO ONE CARES ABOUT PODRACING!!!!  Anyways, back at Renaissance, its open and we go in. We are the 2nd group of people there, and pretty soon some more show up, and I begin to connect names and Decktech handles to faces. Brad Eire, James Booker, Dan Tartaglione, Kevin Elia, John Anderson, and Mike Pistone are all names I get to meet for the first time, among others. All in all, 26 people show up. Anyways, off to the games<br />

VS. Zach Tartells (1734) BHBM Racing<br />
 <br />
WTF!!??? Matched up with Zach? I was so fing pissed. I just spent 6.5 hours with him and now I have to play against him? And further more, the last tournament game I played against him he won by 34. I was snapping. Well, with Start Your Engines, he grabs Combat Response because he knows he needs to control Hoth. His first turn he drops IAO/SP and grabs a db, drops a cave, and says go. Before I activate, I grab Commie Luke, General Rieeken, and General Lando. Luke goes down with his speeder, Rieeken to the Command Center and pulls Romas. I also deploy the 3rd marker. During his turn he does some random stuff, maybe drops another cave, and draws a lot. <br />
	Once again, I pull with EBG and this time it Hobbie, because I have his speeder in my hand. With Luke I pull Rogue 3.  Wedge and Hobbie come down to Marker 2 and 3. With Rieeken I pull Haven, put it on Hoth and deploy Lando, Corran and GS1 there for 2. During my move phase, I flip. Zach drops Bossk (v), Hounds Tooth (v) and Broken Fett against my Falcon. He initiates and I play the ARWI combo but he senses it. I lost both characters, so there goes Haven. He lost Fett because he couldnt pay for him anyways.<br />
	My turn, I drain and damage him, then I use two force to look for a card. Hmmmm, what should I take? Im liking the look of Captain Han, but then I remember that Zach plays with Res Lukrauf. Not good. So I grab Dash (v), no more than one battle destiny when piloting alone. Hot. Drop him and battle and both characters are wiped out.  On his turn, he drops Zuckess (v) and Mist Hunter (v) with EPP 4lom, and Hoth is him for the rest of the game, he also drops Mara Jade and moves her to the 3rd marker, where Hobbie is. Big Mistake. I drain and damage, and use two to grab EPP Obi, a speeder with Luke, and a speeder with Rieeken. I deploy them all, and demolish his Mara Jade. But he draws monster destiny, so he only loses 7 overflow and I lose Obi. But in doing this, I use all my force.  Next turn, down come Vader, BFBH and First Strike against Luke. He also drops Blizzard 4 to the Podrace Arena. With First Strike there goes Houjix and Attack Pattern Delta x2. He initiates, plays I Have You Now and draws a total of 5 destinies that total 17.  I draw two that total 6 so I have 12 power to his 30. I lose everything plus about five from the top. Next turn, I deploy Luke from the lost pile with his objective and put him on a speeder. Qui-Gon w/saber kills Blizzard Four and that ends my turn. His turn he does nothing important and in my next turn, I finish him off with a T-47 Battle Formation. Who said Speeders was non-interactive?<br />

Highs-Surviving Vader and BFBH and the techness of Dash (v).<br />
Lows-Playing Zach.<br />
<br />
Between games, Kevin Elia raffles off various things related to Star Wars, including action figures, cards, uncut sheets and other stuff. I win the drawing for a sheet of LS Tatooine rares. Sweet, my first sheet.<br />

VS Tim Simons (1810?) WHAP that started CD (v) and Wokling.<br />
Well, CD (v), kinda screwed me from the beginning. That and having no senators in my     hand. But I did do something that would have every single game I played with my darkside. I dropped Zuckess(v) and Mist Hunter (v) and Black 2 (v) and DS-61-2 to Naboo. They went unmolested the entire game. First turn for Tim, he got out Secure Route, played C/TV and deployed Amidala to the TR and grabbed C/TV again. He then used it and deployed Jerus? to the TR. Yet again he grabbed the combo card. Used it and deployed Sio Bibble. And grabbed C/TV. He then ended his turn. Well, I drain for two and he used ICBW, which I immediately grabbed. Having no senators I was forced to draw my entire force pile.<br />
 His next turn, he deployed Panaka with his blaster to the hallway, along With Master Qui-Gon with his saber. He then flipped. The next turn I flipped with Lott Dodd and Baskol Yeesrim, and drew a few. The next turn, Tim drained and damaged and then deployed Obi-wan and his lightsaber to the hallway. To the tr, he deployed a handmaiden. During my turn, I pulled the anti-Combat shield (tech!) to prevent his drain of 3 at the hallway, and deployed Maul with saber and P-59 to the throne room. Initiated, but canceled by Its a Trap! Blast. His turn he move Obi over.       Well, I still initiated a battle the next turn, (I probably shouldnt have) and he plays this random jank interrupt that adds a battle destiny when Amidala is with a Handmaiden. WTF!!!?? Anyways, Pfitty misses his shot but Maul hits Bibble and the Hand Maiden. He grossly overpowers me and I have to lose 11 overflow. That was the only battle of the game. The rest of the game is me draining and him draining and putting out Battle Plan.<br />
 He won in the end but a funny thing happened when I had one force left, and one card in my hand. Tim had three cards in his hand, and to keep his differential up, he lost one card from his hand due to Baskol Yeesrim. I nailed him with Limited Resources, and he just sighs and says he shouldve thought if that.<br />

Kyle Hartlines (?) Maul drain deck<br />
<br />
	Well, back home, I have a perfect 2-0 mark against Maul decks so Im not too concerned. I change my starting effects around so that I start Menace Fades instead of Wokling. My first turn I drop Luke and Wedge in their respective speeder and end my turn. He gets a first turn maul AND watto in his hand, plays the sand person and batha, and grabs the lightsaber and moves them to wattos junkyard. Fck. I grab Rieeken, Lando, and Hobbie, get out Haven and get battle plan out. His turn, he drains for 5, and I take it. I end up only taking that drain twice. He reveals Wooof(v) to try and get Jabbas Cruiser, but he cant find it. He deploys Darth Vader with lightsaber and initiates against Luke. I react with Wedge and he plays I Have You Now. He draws a 5 (I cancel) and two 3s.  I forfeit Wedge and he loses Vader plus some overflow. My turn, I put down Zev and Hobbie in their speeders, and put Corran up with Lando. Kyle finally gets JSC and puts Woooooooof and BFBH on it and battles Lando and Corran. I kill his Woof and he gets both of my characters. Its a damage and drain race for me as I keep canceling his drains with ICBW. I finally put Capn Han aboard the Falcon to try and kill the Space Cruiser, but I didnt read it and he reacts with Dengar in Punishing One. Eh. Oh well. No overflow so it didnt matter. Finally it comes down to my last turn as he has five force left and I have 7 and no way to cancel his drains next turn. I activate it all, use one to drop the shields, three to drain for 2, three to drain for 1, and he takes 2 damage from my objective.<br />

The random drawing between rounds is for 20 packs of Cloud City and Zach wins it! So he gets Bespin AND Cloud City to make his classic deck.<br />
<br />
VS. Mike Pisones(1933) Lightside Lightsaber Combat.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Mike says something like this isnt a good match-up for you but an excellent one for me. But lightside cant win. Wow, not only did play playtest extensively with Brandon Schele and his Senate, but LSC is virtually unstoppable against Senate. And he let me know his opinion on this as well. <br />
	Let me just start off by saying that there were no battles in the entire game. First turn, I get a lockdown with Zuckess and DS-61-2 in their ships at Bespin, and they were never bothered. For the entire game I had drains there and at the senate chamber. Mike eventually puts Yoda at one site and Qui-Gon at the other. Qui-Gon gets two combat cards and I know not to mess with him. He also puts out Battle Plan so we both are paying for drains. Its just back and forth for a couple turns with him tracking with Threepio, till he pulled Honor, which I promptly suspend with Tikkes. But the real game breaking card was AAA non-v. This absolutely killed him. He tried to keep up with a Lando, Corran and Jedi Luke, but with my 6 senators in the chamber and two guys at naboo he eventually was losing 2 every turn.  I kept grinding away at him with Yeb Yeb, Baskol, and the drain of 4 at Naboo, Limited Resouorces, and AAA. Totally interactive, but none the less intense game. Sorry that there isnt many details, but there just weren;t any. Afterwards, Mike declared what he had before-Lightside cannot win.<br />

FW +6 (+0 WTF!!)<br />

VS. Drew Scotts(1906) Standard BHBH<br />
<br />
	I got set up fairly quickly with Luke and Wedge, followed by Hobbie the next turn. He deployed a bunch of docking bays, 5 in all. At the Endor Docking Bay Drew deployed Emperor Palpatine and Janus and at the Spaceport Docking Bay he had DV with Lightsaber.  I projectioned both the Endor DB and the Generic DB, and for awhile he forgot about Janus drain adding. Eventually he beat my Lando and falcon out of space with Zuckess in Mist Hunter with Boba Fett BH on it. Damnit, Im going to have to make some changes to my space package, as it can never hold a damn system.<br />
	His Vaders Projection (v) shut down my 4th marker drain, and Imperial decree shut down my damage. I only got off one t-47 formation and that didnt do much anyways. One final battle occurred later in the game as Arica and Dr. E and Ponda B came down and moved over to the 3rd marker. Qui-Gon came down and killed both and Drew had to lose some overflow. But it was too little too late, as he drained me out at endor db and hoth.<br />

Final Round<br />
<br />
VS Brad Eiers(1919) TRM<br />
<br />
	Ughhh I played a terrible game and got horrendous luck and draws.  In fact, I was so pissed at the way I played that I didnt take notes. This is all from memory. Anyways, first turn, Brad plays everything he can from his hand, and then Recoils it, killing my Senate Hovercam, Lott Dod, Tikkes, and Darth Mauk with Saber. Fck. I get back two WYB/SRF combos and Black 2, ds-61-2, and Zuckess. Well, the lockdown rides again. My turn, I lockdown the system (or so I think) play me senators, and end my turn. Brad lays down about 4 twixs and draws. I drain for 2, but he cancels it with C/TV. His turn, he deploys Coruscant DB and deploys Phylo Qui-Gon and Yoda there. Damn. The next turn I drain a little, and draw. Then comes the storm. Tantive IV and Bright Hope arrive and so does Mantellian Savrip. He also deploys Lando aboard. Anyways, I use the WYB combo so he cant cancel my destinies and I have to lose something for attrition. He just loses Boussh with Mantellian Savrip. I fcking hate that card. Next, I deploy Saber 1 with Fel and battle and draw one destiny which brad doesnt cancel, then used WYB combo again to get another draw. It didnt matter, because he had Savrip out. I dont think I have to lose anything. Next he puts Luke and Han on board his ships and battles, and kills Fel. I replace him with another one, put Vader on Mauls Inflitrator, and play I Have You Now. Which is sensed. Curses. Eventually, Home One comes and clears the system, and he bludgeons me to death with drains.<br />

I played 2 of the top 4, so I had the best SoS of the 3-3s. <br />

1st Greg Shaw <br />
2nd James Booker<br />
3rd Brad Eire<br />
4th Drew Scott<br />
<br />
Even though I didnt finish the way I wanted to, the tournament was still awesome. Prize support was crazy, as I got a Jedi Pack, a couple Rebel Leader Packs, and 16 Epps. Afterwards, Hunter and I bought a couple packs of Reflections 3 and I pulled a Darth Maul Young Apprentice and he pulled the URF Qui-Gon. Weird. We didnt want to leave that night so we stayed another night in Edgewood and watched Road Trip and HBO soft core porn. The next morning we left at 5 am, but it felt like 4 with daylight savings time. Hunter and Zach slept the entire 6.5 hour drive back to Watertown. Loser, sticking me with the driving. We rolled into Dub-townat about 12:00 and I crashed and slept for 15 hours. Now to the props and slops:<br />
<br />
