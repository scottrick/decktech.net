<br />
Yeah so the alarm rings Saturday morning and I do not feel like getting up at all. Usually the prospect of an afternoon of SWCCG is enough to get me at least as far as the shower, but today ...<br />
<br />
My roommate&#146;s computer is still playing &quot;The Mighty Steven Hawkings&quot; which he left on repeat OVERNIGHT cuz he&#146;s a psycho; that&#146;s probably what got me out of bed in the first place.<br />
<br />
The tourney starts around 1230, there were ten participants including a few new faces. I get paired against one in the first game ...<br />
<br />
My decks: Goofy Profit that&#146;s really bad but really fun to play; and BHBM with lots of beats and really low destiny =/<br />
You can see a variant of the BHBM on my member page.<br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
My Profit vs. Jesse &quot;The New Kid&quot;&#146;s Death Star start.<br />
First off this kid is the BOMB cuz he just learned how to play at an R2 sealed two weeks ago and he already has the game down pretty well, plus he brought a bunch of friends.<br />
He starts the Death Star with no starting interrupt; hmm I&#146;ll have to speak to him about that. I did teach this kid how to play, after all ;-)<br />
I tell him he can put two aliens in the chamber &quot;if he wants&quot; - and he does; Boelo and Arica undercover. Not bad.<br />
My opening hand has Lando W/Ax, a twix site, and all red =/ I go first so I activate, put down the twix, pull Home One DBay w/Insurrection (I start that, Staging, and YISYW), and draw a couple.<br />
He breaks Arica&#146;s cover and puts down a couple random.locations.<br />
I can do nothing with Lando by himself so I draw and get only one character - Scout Luke (who is in the deck for the sole purpose of removing Vader in BHBM). Yippee.<br />
He goes and puts a Cloud City Trooper all by himself at the Upper Walkway. Ohhhh boy. I tell him that might not be such a good idea but he insists.<br />
So I contemplate putting Luke and Lando over there but I decide getting Han out is more important and I put them in the Chamber. Lando excludes Boelo (the kid knew how the Ax worked, I didn&#146;t even have to explain! kudos) and Mara dies with a little overflow thanks to him drawing high. I Smoke Screend for one of my destinies just to show him what a cool card SScreen is ;-)<br />
He activates and I&#146;m proud to say the kid I taught to play did NOT forget to force drain me with his lone Cloud City Trooper. Nor does he forget to move Boelo the hell out the Chamber so he doesn&#146;t get creamed.<br />
I release Han, retrieve everything, drain, and show him how he has to lose to my objective. By now I have but one character in my hand - Chewie Protector. So I figure why not, I throw him down to square off with the CC Trooper. Power 6 to 2 and the kid opts to lose 4 from hand/life. Wow. That Trooper&#146;s hangin in there. I move Luke and Han out in front of Boelo.<br />
He has been saving force every turn (another &quot;non-newbie&quot; move, I&#146;m proud); so this turn he has enough to drop premiere Vader, Tempest 1, and a random.pilot on the walker to sodomize poor Chewbacca! So I have to lose Chewie and some...wow. Boelo runs away again.<br />
I drain/Profit, and now I have Leia in my hand so she goes to kill Boelo. Luke gets Saberized too.<br />
The next couple turns we exchange drains/Profit damage (he does forget to drain once, but I chide him and lose a card anyway) while he does the save-up-force gig again. Finally he uses a bunch of force for an uncommon Star Destroyer at his Kessel with a couple pilots and a TIE floating around there too. That adds to his drains but I am out-damaging him quite a bit on Tatooine. FW by 30+<br />
<br />
The good: I taught this kid how to play two weeks ago, and he&#146;s progressing pretty well.<br />
<br />
The bad: First game pairings against a newbie.<br />
<br />
The ugly: The BEATDOWN on Chewbacca!!<br />
<br />
So pairings are lopsided and even though I won by a lot I get paired against:<br />
<br />
Dan Pratt (1411)&#146;s Alderaan Ops<br />
I don&#146;t mind playing Pratt I guess. He starts Local Uprising with Alderaan and the Farm. I contemplate swapping Mob Points out of my starting trio for No Escape, but decide to stick with my guns - IAO/MPoints, and Crush. He starts Insurrection and some randomness ...<br />
My first turn I pull DS2 dockbay, Endor DBay from hand, and Palpy there. Carida too. Save the last force or draw it, I forget.<br />
He goes and draws.<br />
I pull a Monnok and drain before playing it lost because I suck at this game. I get two Alderaan Ops and would have gotten two Artoos but I drained first and he lost an Artoo to it =( I look for a dbay and see that I activated No Escape so I draw hoping it isn&#146;t in the 4 force I used for the Monnok. It isn&#146;t =)<br />
He goes and puts more sites out on Alderaan .. he&#146;s up to 4 now hahaa. Draws.<br />
I drain and consider Monnoking again but dont. Drop No Escape. Put Janus down with Palpy. Let him go.<br />
He puts an Alderaan Op at the Forest with KalFal, Red Leader, and Wioslea (hahaaa). My turn.<br />
I activate waaay too much, Monnok and see that he has no Houjix/It&#146;s a Trap or anything, then drop the following at the Forest:<br />
Dengar w/Gun (for 2)<br />
Dr. E/Bob (for ONE)<br />
Blizzard 2 (for 3)<br />
Mara (for 2)<br />
and her saber (1)<br />
Guri (for 3) and<br />
EPP Fett (for 2)<br />
Initiate, shoot and operate everyone but Wioslea, beat the used speeder dealer for some 30+ in battle damage.<br />
You can probably figure out how the game went after that.<br />
FW by 30+<br />
<br />
The good: The big BEATDOOOWN<br />
<br />
The bad: Lopsided pairings.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Pratt&#146;s mom on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
My BHBM against Mike Van Zander (1790)&#146;s  WYS Lewis Style<br />
Yeah so Zander borrowed some Raiders and made the deck. I&#146;m really not terribly excited to be playing against someone I can play during the week (and neither is he) but I&#146;m looking forward to testing my deck against the famous Raider machine.<br />
I look in my opening hand hoping to see Thrawn, but the only space-related card is Bossk in the Bus. Bleh. So I can&#146;t decide if I want to pull Carida or the Ex with Mob Points so I don&#146;t pull anything right away.<br />
First turn Palpy goes to DBay 94, I pull DS2 DBay, draw one and save one.<br />
His first turn he draws - what I was hoping he&#146;d do.<br />
I pull a Monnok and play it lost (BEFORE draining this time). Get two Raiders and two Crafts. Phat. The only guys in his hand are Cap&#146;n and Mirax and he has no Tunnels so I know Palpy is safe for now. Drain for one, and I have two Barriers in hand so I draw and save two.<br />
He goes and pulls EPP Luke from reserve to DBay 94. Barrier. He draws.<br />
I got Sim and Dengar in hand so I pull Force Lightning, I Have You Now, activate, drop the two goons, fry Luke, battle, shoot with Dengar, play I Have You Now and draw 4 BD&#146;s. His draws are low (thank you Sim) so I get away with losing Dengar only. He has to lose Luke and 9ish in BD (then one to Insignificant Rebellion). I draw and boo-ya there&#146;s Thrawn. Alriiight.<br />
He goes and draws.<br />
I think of Monnoking, and probably should have, but don&#146;t. Drain, put Guri down with Palpy and Sim, and draw. There&#146;s the Executor - I won&#146;t even need Mob Points. Meanwhile I have not deployed a single location with light side force icons so he is only generating from his own cards.<br />
He goes and gets a Raider/Craft at the &lt;&gt; Dockbay, and some random smuggler at the Lars Farm (might have been another Raider).<br />
I put Xizor at the &lt;&gt; DBay and some scrubs at the Lars Farm or whatever and battle with Xizor first. The Prince vs. a Raider/Craft = my 5 +draw to his 4. I draw a 1 (as my deck is prone to do) so he loses the Raider and one to IR. I battle at the other spot and win a card there too. Move my guys around some so that most everyone is at DBay 94 (under the protection of Guri).<br />
He goes and puts Jedi Luke and Owen/Beru at the LMF and Harvests. I had played Secret Plans and Something Special earlier on so he places the Harvest OOP and has to pay for the retrieval which leaves him with little force to do anything else with.<br />
I get some guys in the Cantina at some point and am draining for two there. Now that Luke is down on the farm Bob Evans-style and I have cards stacked, I figure I may as well drop the LV down to capture him and beat up on Owie and Brew. I forget who else I put down with Vader, but bottom line is O&amp;B got punked for four in BD which Zander Houjixed away (with a Jap Houjix, no less). I then moved LV over to the DB 94 in preparation for some duelin&#146; (with 4 cards stacked). Moved Guri on in to the Cantina with Mighty J and the Prince and those three can&#146;t be stopped.<br />
He got some more Raiders and crap down at the &lt;&gt; Dbay and LMF for some draining but I knew better than to go at those guys, espesh since most of my heavy-hitters were on table already.<br />
I drain at the Cantina, then transit Palpy, Vader, and Co. to the DS2 in preparation for some dueling. I&#146;m not using much force so my force pile is stacking up.<br />
He drains me at the LMF and &lt;&gt; DB, then puts a second O&amp;B down at the farm and proceeds to Harvest from lost pile =(. Place it OOP.<br />
I drain, get my guys into the Throne Room, lose the duel, and don&#146;t draw high enough to win the game. Bleh. He goes and drains me - I have been losing excess cards from hand to these drains but now I am down to four in hand.<br />
I go, drain, and duel again but win this time and he loses three force.<br />
He drains, then shows me Cap&#146;n Han from hand for Squassin...he has ONE card in reserve, and lo and behold, it&#146;s the Falcon! He has only five force active so he thinks he can&#146;t deploy it, but I remind him that freighters are deploy -2 to the &lt;&gt; DBay. So Han goes there and takes off for free to the system.<br />
Which is just what I was looking for. I activate all but three and now I have a monster force pile (and still 4 cards in hand). I drain and then pay 15 for the EXECUTOR to Tatooine system. 4 more for THRAWN on it and then I realize ... I only had 19 force active =( I don&#146;t have one to initiate. But then I look in my hand and BANG the two remaining cards are I Have You Now and OPERATIONAL AS PLANNED. I play OAP to put the card back and start the fight. I don&#146;t draw BD because I have only three cards in reserve, but I still beat him on power and he loses Han and his fifth card to IR. I duel, and lose the duel so I win the game.<br />
FW by low 20s<br />
<br />
The good: Beating the Lewis deck. OPERATIONAL AS PLANNED<br />
<br />
The bad: Blind luck pulling the Falcon at the end.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Monnok.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4<br />
Janky Profit vs. Ken Rose (1680s)&#146;s Court with walkers, 900 Tramples, and beats.<br />
He starts First Strike and some effects I don&#146;t remember. All I remember is he didn&#146;t start No Bargain or Power o&#146; the Hut so... He also puts Mara and old-school Roofoo in the Chamber.<br />
I look in my opening hand and get a big ol&#146; stiffy. Massa Luke, Anakin&#146;s, and Clash ... mwahahahaaaa. Goo Nee Tay too which is great.<br />
His first turn he activates, deploys Cantina and Mara&#146;s Saber on her. My turn ... should I go for it or not??<br />
I do. I activate, drop Massa w/Daddy&#146;s stick, Clash Mara, initate and play Captive Pursuit so if I win the battle (&quot;IF&quot; I win the battle..hahaa) Han is released. Well Dr. E gets smacked and my BD is a 3 so he dies along with 8 cards. Han is released and I have 5 force in reserve and 2 in lost pile ... he started Secret Plans (I remember now) and I don&#146;t want to pay the 5 for the 2, especially considering that I need to stock my hand. I draw.<br />
He goes, activates, draw a little, and saves a bunch. Uh oh. I go and make him lose to Profit. I am anticipating a beatdown in the Chamber as Mara will be un-Clashed next turn. All I have character-wise is Lando so he goes in there. Ken&#146;s turn.<br />
He activates and drops premiere Vader (w/saber), Blizzard 2, and Tarkin piloting to the Palace. Moves Mara out there. I breathe a temporary sigh of relief as he vacates the Chamber. But now he has a beastial drain of FOUR at the Palace. Yuck.<br />
I drain him in the Chamber and make him lose to Profit, then put Ben at the Palace and move EVERYBODY from the Chamber to the JP. So now it&#146;s Ben, Massa w/, EPP Han, and Lando vs. Vader w/, Mara w/, and Tarkin on Blizzard 2. I am holding a Portal, a Weapon Lev a Sorry About the/Blaster Pro and some other goodies so I think I can handle it.<br />
I have also deployed some DBays so the setup on Tatooine is, left to right:<br />
Cantina-DB 94-Pit of Carkoon-&lt;&gt;DB-Tat:JP-JP:AC<br />
Anyway he decides not to fight me and puts Xizor and Arnet in the Cantina and runs the guys at the Palace away to the &lt;&gt;DB.<br />
I have Leia and Chewie P in hand so they drop to the Cantina, Leia shoots Arnet but I draw low and Xizor holds. I lose Chewie. I follow the crew to the &lt;&gt;DB, still holding all my interrupts.<br />
He goes and puts Tempest 1 to the DB 94 and moves Xizor out there to pilot it. And did I mention he has tried to Trample Lando like 8 times? He at one point played two Tramples in a row and missed both, then played another like next turn and missed again.<br />
Anyway he eventually nails Lando, but it&#146;s on my turn so I decide that&#146;s when it&#146;s time to split up. I have another Lando in hand and he goes to the Chamber to drain/cause Profit damage. Massa says bye-bye to Ben and Han, and those two transit over to the DB 94 to meet up with a recently-deployed Corran Horn.<br />
We run around for a few turns, but I am outdamaging him thanks to my objective and he begins to realize it. So he splits up too. He puts Mara w/Saber in front of my Leia at Tat:JP, and Mara had some backup but I can&#146;t remember who.<br />
He is expressing his fear of Fallen Portal so I know he knows I have it. I decide to leave Leia at the Palace so Mara won&#146;t drain me for three. He knows I have the Portal, but he doesn&#146;t know what else I have .... &gt;=)<br />
He starts the fight there, and I Portal, but he grabs it and I miss anyway (did I mention he grabbed my OOC/TT too? gah that&#146;s annoying. and oh yeah I guess that was his third starting effect, TinT/OE). But then I Weapon Lev Mara&#146;s Stick and play Run Luke Run to slide Massa over for some extra power and a saber swing. I hit someone and Sorry/Blaster Pro them away and clear the site. I probably lost Leia but I don&#146;t remember. That was about all the action that happened this game, it was just me running from him, him running from me, and me outdamaging him thanks to my objective and the early jump-start I got from the Dr. E beating. FW by 13<br />
<br />
The good: My opening hand. Run Luke Run.<br />
<br />
The bad: Grabbed OOC/TT.<br />
<br />
The ugly: The Severe Beating of Dr. Evazan =P<br />
<br />
So I&#146;m the only undefeated and I win the tournament. Second place went to Mike Van Zander and third to Jason Stewart. They were both 3-1 but Ears (Stewart) had a timed win. I get 3 packs of R2 and pull jack. There was a Clash foil too but I have one of those so Zander (the director) just raffled it off and one of the new kids got it (which is good).<br />
<br />
Card of the day (dark): No Escape<br />
Card of the day (light): Run Luke Run<br />
<br />
Mini props/slops<br />
Props:<br />
To Jesse the new kid for being pretty good at SWCCG after only two weeks and bringing a bunch of new guys.<br />
To Pratt for trading me an LSJK and only needing 4 more cards for a set of R2.<br />
To my opening hand against Ken, that was huge.<br />
To Nick&#146;s AoBS deck for timing out against Ears.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
To the Final Four for being totally unworthy of my attention.<br />
To SWCCG for being like a chore anymore.<br />
To General Calrissian for being a foil Rebel.<br />
<br />
