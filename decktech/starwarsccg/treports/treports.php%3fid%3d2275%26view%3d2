<br />
Want to hear about Alderaan States from Mr. 2nd place himself? Well, here it is....<br />
<br />
<br />
Prelude<br />
<br />
Its just a week after the DPC at Vegas and Im still spinning from it. Im looking for something to play for States, and Im all over the decks I saw at the Vegas DPC. A few top choices as far as I was concerned were my ISB Scum, Chu&#146;s Hunt Down, my TIGIH Scouts, and Jason Kilby&#146;s Profit. I had been messing around with Kilby&#146;s Profit alot, myself being a big fan of Profit back in the day, and feeling a bit sick(and slightly dissapointed) of my TIGIH Scouts. Kilby&#146;s version is Speed Profit with insane destinies and smooth battling power, but it still had the weaknesses Profit had before, although it still worked.<br />
<br />
After talking some more with Ohmy Fasudhani, I got to playtest it against an AOBS deck, and between 6 games it split with it 3-3....not the best of records but alot better than my TIGIH can do against it. After this result, I looked into Jonny Chu&#146;s Y4 Mains he used at DPC, and dubbed it a backup deck if the Profit lost some more during playtesting. So I call up Steve Daniel to arrange some rides and he talks to Nick Stefanko, who agrees to let me stay over at his place so I can get my ride there. <br />
<br />
Friday night Steve gets down to my place a few hours later than expected due to some supposedly poor directions from Nick, and rush hour traffic. We sit down at Nick&#146;s place and commence playtesting, where the Profit pulls off a 2-2 performance, not what I need for States. So I dismantle it and make Chu&#146;s Y4, and stick with Hunt Down for Dark. Steves determined to use this stupid cheese numbers deck for Light, and BHBM Mains for Dark, and Nick has Death Star CPI for Dark, and RTP Mains for Light. So after thats all said and done I sit down on an office chair and pass out for 2 hours then get waken up at 6 in the morn to get on the road.<br />
<br />
We get into a white Ford Taurus hatchback and were on the road, only the car is about 5 miles from blowing up. Nick starts down the road and immediately we realize the damn thing has NO springs. Nick hits a bump, and all of a sudden, the speedometer is out and were registered as going 0 MPH despite our actual speed. We get to the BART Station and pick up Andrew Meewis and Mike Mendoza, and immediately everyone is all over Mike for some Golden Grahams and crack(I swear, Clayton has ruined you, Mike).<br />
<br />
So were in the &quot;Car of Death&quot; for another few hours and Im in the car listening to &quot;My Way&quot; by Limp Bizkit(aka the Wrestlemania song) and &quot;The Game&quot; by Motorhead. We finally get make it there, and theyre not even open yet. We sit around and Steve and I hit Jack in the Crack across the street for some breakfast. We get back and alot of people are outside just waiting to get in. The store finally opens up, and we walk inside and sit another hour before the tourney gets underway(Im never doing decklists ahead of time again). So Hardy finally starts us up, and its a 10 dollar entry and 8 games. Another Vegas. Its....About....to go....DOWN.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Decks<br />
<br />
LS: Chu&#146;s Y4 Mains: Jonny&#146;s LS Deck at DPC Vegas....check his TR for the decklist.<br />
<br />
DS: Chu&#146;s Hunt Down Smackdown: Jonny&#146;s DS Deck at DPC Vegas....check his TR for the decklist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The GAME<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS vs. Paul Feldman&#146;s LS Watch Your Step<br />
<br />
So were standing around waiting for pairings and Im calling this match jokingly, and it happens....guess I should be careful what I ask for. Vader hits the table first turn and I go from there. Visage is canceled fast but I maintain board control. He drops Mos Eisley and Veers on Blizzard 2 populates that shortly thereafter. Im paying for my drains due to his Battle Plan, and he finally drops Kessel with Capt. Han on Falcon there. So I look at my hand, no ships. I activate until I have just 4 cards left in Reserve, and look with Crush. They are Chimaera x2, Zuckuss in MH, and Twilek.....UGH. So I just sit and wait for him to make the next move. He drops guys to the Docking Bay 94 and flips, and now Im forced to react to him. So I activate the ships but I instead opt to kill his ground force. I drop Blizzard 2 and move Veers over, and hold a Trample in the waiting. He instead runs away from me, and keeps nailing me for 3 a turn at Kessel. Im paying 3 to drain and he just Controls it from the Lost for the next 3 turns, and Im still not seeing any ships. By now, hes way ahead of me, and I dont have the force needed to drop the ships anymore without suffering severe beatdown(though I still dont have them in hand), and his ground force just isnt going away, so I just scoop. Loss by 23.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 0(-23)<br />
Highs: Uh.....what?<br />
Lows: Uh.....yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
So that SUCKED. Im not feeling too gitty and I have one loss in the bag from the start. But then Feldman starts talking and tells me that my chances arent diminished yet. Im just one loss in the bag, and 6-2 can easily get into the final duel. Not to mention the next few people I play will be scrubs, so I just play through and see what happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS vs. Geoff Nixon&#146;s DS MKOS musician Variant<br />
<br />
I get a great start with two TWIX sites in my opening hand. I grab the H1 Dbay and roll from there. He grabs a site then uses Power of the Hutt and misses the Barge, and is forced to deploy Bib alone instead, since he only got 5 this turn. My turn, Ounee Ta and EPP Obi comes down and takes him out plus 7 more. He counters with 3 musicians, but one gets hacked, and I draw a 6 to take out the other 2. From there, it goes downhill for him. He drops the Cantina for force, and I park Jedi Luke and stick there alone, and drop Kessel and Home One as well. He drops a few people to the AC, and I drop Battle Plan to add insult to injury. I hit him for 6 to his one a few turns and he gets desperate and goes after Luke with 3 musicians. One gets hacked, and another falls to attrition, and the third runs to the Desert Heart. I drop Order to Engage and move Luke in. He doesnt have much of a chance, so he battles Luke, which causes about 5 in overflow. From there, I hit him for 6 a few more turns, and he scoops. Win by 36.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 2(+13)<br />
Highs: One game and Im back in positives<br />
Lows: Get this.....I get +13 and he has -69....talk about playing the numbers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: DS vs. Timothy Green&#146;s LS Y4 Chu-Style Mains<br />
<br />
Tims a bit shocked to play me, but he has a great start on me. He has 3 TWIX sites in his opening, and out-activates me from the start. He cancels Visage early, and were both trying to get our force rolling. I drop Emporer and Ozzel the Executor Dbay and he drops Orrimaarko and Blount to the H1 Dbay. We both bust out our CC Dbays and I drop Mara and DLOTS there with sticks to flip, shuttle Emporer and Ozzel over. He drops OG Obi-Wan w/ stick and Tawss to his, and shuttles Orrimaarko and Blount over. Im draining for 3 to his 2, and he draws up to 14. I hit him for Monnok Lost, and I kill 2 EPP Lukes. He tracks a 6 and retrieves them back, and drops OTEngage and Corran to my CC Dbay, and moves the rest over. I counter with Veers in Blizzard 2 and I Holonet and drop Tarkin there as well and battle to take out everyone but Melas. He drops more people to his CC Dbay, and regroups there. I drop Janus drain a few turns and he decides to come back for more. I Janus on my turn and find Tempest 1. I drop Chiraneau on it and take out his whole crew again. Hes reeling and trying to look for some options. I drop Visage and continue the pressure. He tries drawing for Luke, but nothing happens, and he loses by 22.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 4(+35)<br />
Highs: Continuing the comeback<br />
Lows: Nothing much....Tim was a great opponent<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4: LS vs. Josh Certo&#146;s DS MKOS Skrilling Swarm<br />
<br />
I swear, I play Josh at every major event. But anyways, like times before, this match goes my way. I get a TWIX site in my opening hand and grab the H1 Dbay first turn, and pick up to find another TWIX. He grabs the Lower Corridor and drops the Sail Barge from deck. I drop the TWIX and draw some more and find even more TWIX sites. He pulls the AC and picks up to 12. I drop the &lt;&gt; Docking between the Desert and JP, and drop Jedi Luke and stick there and move over to JP. He counters with an all out assualt, Pote driving the Barge, Merc Pilot, 4 Skrills, Ephant, Boelo and battle. I hit Boelo and Blaster Prof him away, and pull a 5 for destiny. He pulls double destiny and Luke bits it and 3 overflow. He moves everyone into the AC, and drops Gailid for drains. I drop Boussh and sit for a few turns, building my hand and saving some. He&#146;s not moving out, so I drop EPP Obi there, and he doesnt have None Shall Pass, so I proceed to drop Blount and Chewie, Protector there, break Boussh&#146;s cover and battle to wipe out almost everyone there, while Chewie keeps Pote&#146;s game text canceled. From there, its an all-out fight at the AC, but without any way to deal with Chewie, and Obi hacking everything away, Josh loses the fight after half the game. I gain control of the AC late game, and retrieve a few with Edge cards, and Josh scoops. Thank Decipher for the new Chewie. Win by 23.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 6(+58)<br />
Highs: Playing Josh, always fun<br />
Lows: Nothing much<br />
<br />
<br />
So now Im 3-1 and Ive turned over that loss, and it turns out Feldman has lost one too. There are alot of 3-1s, but Paul McKelvey is still undefeated and is killing everyone with his WYS and ISB decks. I go over to the Baja Grill for a burrito that very much tasted Chinese in the center, and shoot the breeze with the Lodi crew. After eating I realize its only halfway mark, and theres still 4 more to go.....so lets do this thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5: DS vs. Jon Dalnaby&#146;s LS Speed Profit<br />
<br />
I start Mara and Xizor to Profit. First turn, Mara gets her stick and I move them both out for an early drain of 3. Down comes Master Luke and Tawss with Battle Plan to take Xizor out, and I draw too low to kill either of them. My turn I run back to the AC and commence drawing. Down comes JPSD Lando and he kills Mara and moves Luke and Tawss over for the flip. I drop Blizzard 2 and Veers to JP and Lord Vader to the Executor Dbay to shuttle over to the DS Dbay and sit. He pays to drain and draws a few. I drop Tarkin to Vader, Vader&#146;s stick, and Chiraneau on Chimaera to Carida to satisfy Battle Plan. From there, its a drain of 6 for free to his 1 for 3. He&#146;s reluctant to move Han over, fearing Trample, and he opts to move Luke with Meditation over instead. I take out Luke and Luke draws below my immunity thanks to Command. He tries in vain for several turns to take out Veers, while Vader and Chiraneau nail him for 4 a turn. At one point, he tries JPSD Lando and Chewie Protector at Veers, and I Command for extra destiny and draw a 6 and 4 to off them both, and he draws 0 and 3 to keep Veers alive. After that, Jon opts to scoop up. Win by 19.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 8(+77)<br />
Highs: Keeping that fire burning<br />
Lows: His own card screwed him....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6: LS vs. Jason Makohan&#146;s DS Court Beats<br />
<br />
I get two TWIX&#146;s to open and I sack Insight for Honor which keeps his Objective off me for a few turns. He uses the AC for Mara and her stick first turn, and backs him up with Xizor the 2nd. I come down with Jedi Luke and stick, which gets Barriered, and EPP Obi. His turn, he Disarms Luke and runs. I drop Boussh to block his drains, which lasts 2 turns before he drops IG and Hutt Smooches her. He draws up Endor and drops Zuckuss there. I counter with Home One and a pilot, which meets another Barrier. He comes back with 3 BH Ships and takes out Home One, but I Ounee Ta and get it right back. Im chasing him over Tatooine and it takes me awhile but I finally get Order to Engage out to force an issue. He drops Kashyyyk and moves Zuckuss over for a hefty drain in space. I need to get around his Battle Order, so I drop Home One to Carida instead, and come down with EPP Han and Tawss to back up the ground force. He drops Mighty Jabba, Dengar and Dr. E and battles me, but Fallen Portal meets Dengar and Dr. E, and I take out Xizor and Mara, and he takes out Luke. He runs to the &lt;&gt; Dbay to meet Han and Tawss. I try and miss the SATMess on IG, but proceed and battle him anyways to retrieve one. I hit Jabba with Han and IG captures Han, adding Leia back to my small Life Force. Tawss takes out IG and he has no more ground and now he needs to pay for drains and I dont. I work his own objective on him, and hit him for 4 a turn for free, and I manage to edge him out by 3. <br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 10(+80)<br />
Highs: Playing Jason, a good opponent<br />
Lows: Nothing much.....it was a good game<br />
<br />
<br />
So right now Im at a 5-1 spot, but there are a few others with me, like Feldman, Alex Sheynis, and Kyle Ishimaru. Paul McKelvey is still wrecking everyone with his WYS and ISB, but hes about to run smack dab into a double dose of Feldman. Im just hoping to keep on running and hope the fire doesnt die out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 7: LS vs. Alexander Sheynis&#146; DS Hunt Down Smackdown<br />
<br />
Alex is a local here, and Im glad to see he&#146;s doing so well. Too bad I have to take him out. The first turn of this game pretty much sums it up. I drop Honor from my opening to nix Visage a few turns and a few TWIX sites and let him go. He loses to Visage off the top, and its No Escape. Needless to say, the whole game I kept Visage on him, and he never could satisfy Honor. He drops Vader and crew to his CC Dbay and flips, but a Jedi Luke with stick and EPP Han keeps him on zero side most of the game. He gets in a few nasty battles though, one left EPP Han alone vs. Mara, Snoova and a walker for Han and 16 overflow, but its not nearly enough to end me, and off that, he couldnt do anything hurt me, with Boussh squatting next to Mara and him not drawing Vaders stick, his own card killed him. Win by 19.<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 12(+99)<br />
Highs: Its my way, its my way....my way or the highway.....<br />
Lows: Nothing much, although Alex shouldve had that one, if he played a bit smarter.....live and learn<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 8: DS vs. Kyle Ishimaru&#146;s LS Watch Your Step<br />
<br />
So its come down to this. The winner of this game, and the winner of Feldman and McKelveys would head into the final duel. I get Lord Vader to the Executor Dbay and shuttle over for the first turn flip. He comes down with EPP Luke, battles, slices, and Blaster Prof&#146;s Vader. I counter with Veers and a walker, and take out Luke. He then drops Kessel with a lone Outrider and Dash and draws the rest. I come down with Chimaera, Thrawn, Lateral and First Strike, and rape the thing plus 8 more, and proceed to take over Tatooine. From there Vader comes down another time just to die, and gets OOC&#146;ed shortly thereafter. Were both burning to Visage, but I have people at the CC and Tatooine Dbays, and im satisfying his Battle Plan, and he&#146;s not. We have a few more skirmishes on ground, but nothing major. In the end, theres nothing he can do about my space drain and CC Drains, while Im keeping him occupied at the Tat Dbay. So I drain him out and win it by 17.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 14(+116)<br />
Highs: Im in! And Kyle was a trip to play....we were actually singing Canada&#146;s National Anthem in the beginning, and Limp Bizkit in the end<br />
Lows: Nothing much<br />
<br />
<br />
So I walk up to Nick Miller, and immediately he tells me Im in the final confrontation, and Im stoked. I sit around and think about the matchups and wait until the other matchups are done, and think about the final duel. After all is said and done, Feldman beats McKelvey, and its me and him in the final duel.....here are the results after 8 games:<br />
<br />
<br />
1st: Alfred Dong  14(+116)<br />
2nd: Paul Feldman 14(+100)<br />
3rd: Paul McKelvey 12<br />
4th: Jason Makohan 12<br />
5th: Alexander Sheynis 12<br />
6th: Kyle Ishimaru 12<br />
<br />
<br />
So I win the overall tournament, but its down to me and Feldman in the final confrontation. I just head into it thinking Im going to play like I always do, and give him a good game. We Ro-Sham-Bo for who goes first, and throw a coin for the sides, and I win both, so Im dark the first game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Duel: DS vs. Paul Feldman&#146;s LS Watch Your Step<br />
<br />
I get another great start on him, and I send Lord Vader from Executor to Tatooine to flip first turn again. This time he wouldnt cancel Visage, and it would bite at us all game. He drops Mos Eisley again, and I send Mara and a walker there immediately for some early drains. He eventually does the same trick he does earlier, dropping Kessel and a few ships there, and having a mediocre ground force to the Tat Dbay and Controlling my drains from the Lost for the next few turns to flip the advantage towards him. From there, I cant do much about it, I drop Bossk to Carida to at least make my drains free, but its not helping much, but Visage keeps him down, and he edges me out by 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
So Im sick to my stomach I lost the that same retarded deck again, and curse myself for not playing Grabbers, which wouldve won me the game easy. I walk outside for a breather and try to think things through, but my mind is too tired, so I just walk back in there and play through.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Duel: LS vs. Paul Todd Feldmans DS SYCFA <br />
<br />
I get a good start, but nothing in my hand but a few TWIX sites. He sets up his force and drops Merrejk to the DS War Room and pulls Kashyyyk.  I take out Merrejk with Corran, Wedge, and Blount, since Corran got Barriered. He sets up with Nemet on a Dreadnaught, and I counter with Home One, which gets Barriered. I drop Mirax on board, and drop Melas to the H1 War Room. He comes down the Arica, EPP Vader, and a few more guys to Melas, and another Dreadnaught to Home One, Lateral, and Battle Order. Needless to say, this game was all his. <br />
<br />
<br />
So its over. Feldman wins another seat at worlds, and I have to settle for second, which isnt bad from my point of view. Steve walks up to me and gives a the L5R starter Ive been looking at for free. I get the Runner-Up fanny pack and a DS Sense foil for my efforts. After saying farewell to the SF crew, and shaking hands with 3rd place for a job well done, we head off in the car of death again. <br />
<br />
We get back to Nicks house after a few hours, and Steve, Nick and myself head off to Nicks dorm in UC Santa Cruz, and now we have a perilous journey home. I pass out on the car ride back to my place, but I wake up and we were almost about to die off the freeway. We head to Carrows for some food to freshen up, and I get home the next day at 4 in the morning, just write this long thing up for you. Speaking of which, going 7-1, placing first in the tourney, and losing in the final.....sound familiar? (Check Chu&#146;s TR) Heh, what a world.....well, here props and slops:<br />
