9/1/07<br />
<br />
Hey folks!  Dragon Con happened maybe a month ago in Atlanta, and some of the Atlanta guys (Cedric) wanted to have events at the con, since dragon con is about the sweetest one there is.  For myself though, I knew I&#39;d have to work at least one of the days, but I was able to get Saturday off for the big constructed tournament.  Friday there was a D*II/Endor only tournament, all the proceeds of which went to the Save the Ewoks Foundation.  Of course, since I gag at the sight of furry women (no matter what race), I could not support such an event and went to work instead.<br />
<br />
A few weeks before the tournament I finally got the cards needed to make a decent There is Good in Him deck, heavily based off one Reid Smith played at some tournament earlier this year.  It uses mass Smoke Screen, I Can&#39;t Believe He&#39;s Gone (v), and I&#39;m With You Too (v) (remember, this is pre-errata) to get some easy battle wins and cards stacked on I Feel the Conflict.  I had to make a couple changes though because of not having some cards, but I was satisfied with the deck.<br />
<br />
My dark side was a real problem though.  I wanted to play Mains or Fear, but I only have 1 Sidious, 0 EPP Maul, 1 Emp Palpatine, etc etc.  So I decided to go with the original Atlanta dark deck, I&#39;m Sorry (v) clouds.  It also helped that I had just gotten 2 of the free Executor effects from C1G earlier in the week.  There are many different routes that a clouds deck can take, and I had been working on different ones for a while now, but unfortunately was missing some key cards for what I thought was the best version.  So I threw together a crappier one a couple days before the tournament, giving myself some days for small tweaks.  The night before though, I was deadset on totally changing the deck, but talked myself out of it.  Its never a good idea to build a tournament deck the day before the tournament.  By the way, the clouds deck used free Executor, the OS-72-X in Obsidian X ties (Obsidian 10 (v) for backup), Gen. Veers (v) in Blizzard 1 (v), and the best mains I could muster to bolster ground.  Also it had Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Boba in Slave 1 to help anywhere in the skies.<br />
<br />
So the day of the tournament comes and I am hoping to go 4-2 (3-0 w/ light, 1-2 w/ dark).  I also expected to see some Fear decks and Ellors/TBMv decks, none of which made an appearance that I know of (weird, I know).  <br />
<br />
I left my apartment real early with a backpack full of food, drove to Publix where I got Gatorade and some soda, and headed off for Dragon Con.  I suppose this is the right time to mention that I didn&#39;t want to spend $40 on a Con badge.  It just wasn&#39;t worth it to me, as I&#39;d rather buy a couple Jedi Luke&#39;s or something.  At the same time, I didn&#39;t want to get kicked out mid tournament.  Cedric called me though and said that nobody in the CCG area had cared about badges on Friday, so I thought I&#39;d be okay.  Him and I met up and went out to watch some parade that we heard was going on.  Well, the parade was basically anybody who was dressed up for the Con (which was hundreds of people), parading through Atlanta with others dressed like them.  The grand finale of it was the Star Wars section, which had some awesome costumes.  The army of stormtroopers was totally sweet.<br />
<br />
Before the event, I heard that some players from FL had come in town, and was thinking they&#39;d definitely win, since earlier in the year they&#39;d won Dagobah regionals, which I didn&#39;t go to but a lot of other ATL players did.  So I filled out my two decklists: &quot;There is Good in Reid Smith&quot; and &quot;Bad Decks Don&#39;t Get Names&quot;.<br />
<br />
Before I talk about the games, I gotta say that Henry was our TD (tournament advocate henry, who will be TD-ing worlds) and he was awesome as always!<br />
<br />
Game 1:  my TIGIH vs. Reverend Joe&#39;s Watto<br />
I was quite relieved to be playing my good deck @ the start, just because I always need to play the first game before my nerves calm down.  On the other hand, I was playing against one of the FL players, who I knew were good, and was playing against Watto, a deck I&#39;d never played a full game against.  All in all, this was a kind of sucky game.  The Reverend stacked a ton of characters on Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge (v) (like 10), I had Luke @ the Endor: Docking Bay draining, and I had Mace, Qui-Gon, Leia Rebel Princess, and Padme pestering his setup on Tatooine.  By pester, I mean avoiding battling so as not to get beat on by the Sail Barge crew with an Outflank (v).  Rev. Joe did not play much anti-Leia Rebel Princess (only 2 Mara (v) that was lost off the top of the reserve at some point), but he was able to steal my Threepio WHPS with Reegesk.  Luckily, it didn&#39;t matter as I&#39;d just move Leia away from his beat crew and in front of some other aliens.  It was a tough game for him to play, as he was only able to hit me for 1 or 2 a turn, and I had Padme and Luke hitting him for 4.  Oh, did I mention there were no battles this game?  And I forgot to retrieve with Luke Rebel Scout (v), which was totally stupid.  Anyway, a rusty win is a win. 2(+22ish).<br />
<br />
Highs: The whole Skywalker family, workin their mojo.<br />
Lows:  No battles and dumb mistakes.  Having to play a game to really get warmed up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2:  my crappier Clouds deck vs. Cedric&#39;s TRM<br />
Okay, game 2 is beginning, and I&#39;m going to get my first loss.  No problem, I&#39;m going 4-2 anyways right?  See, Cedric has played the I&#39;m Sorry (v) clouds deck a lot, and at a couple tournaments too.  So he knows how to beat it.  And he&#39;s playing Mains, which my dark deck is weak against.  For example, my TIGIH deck owns my Clouds deck by 20ish or so.  Problem for Cedric though is that, well, I dunno.  Things just didn&#39;t work for him that well.  And his tracking was off, which definitely helped me win.  Anyways, early on Cedric Recoiled in Fear two different times to screw over my Endor Shield and Admiral Piett pulls.  But I had already gotten out the free Executor, which is good.  I also lost hold of Breached Defenses (v), which is a key card for me against HC&F.  I went ahead and set up some ties in the clouds and Cedric got out Jedi Luke with Luke&#39;s Saber on Cloud City.  Soon, Gen Veers in Blizzard 1 Came down to challenge Luke.  I don&#39;t remember the exact order, but some battles took place and Cedric mistracked so he had to lose Luke to battle damage and I lost nothing.  I don&#39;t remember what else happened this game exactly.  I think he came down with EPP Qui-Gon twice to kill two different Darth Maul&#39;s.  The first time he hit with his saber, the second he missed and then drew too low of a battle destiny (he could only draw one because I had out Battle Deployment).  And the whole time I was damaging him in the clouds, and soon it was GG.  Cedric could have probably won, but there was some bad luck and some mistracks, so my bad deck got lucky. 2(+20ish)=4(+45ish)<br />
<br />
Highs: My deck being able to recover from some Recoil in Fears, as designed to do.<br />
Lows:  Cedric seemed pretty upset at himself.<br />

Game 3: my TIGIH deck vs Florida-guy Travis&#39; scrub ROPS<br />
So Travis and I were undefeated and I am thinking that I soon won&#39;t be, since Travis won Dagobah regionals and I knew he was a good player.  Fortunately for me, I think scrub ROPS is a good matchup for TIGIH, since if I can keep Vader off the table, I can make him lose force for having captive Luke.  On top of that, Travis hadn&#39;t updated his decks with the v13 virtual shields or put in the Watch Your Back (v) he would have if he had time.  This made it a relatively easy game for me, although I think that if he had of updated his decks, I still would have had a chance to win.  So Travis flips pretty quick, with scrubs at some sites and EPP Vader at Ralltiir&#39;s docking bay (in case Luke comes there).  Well Luke did not go there, until after I had deployed Quiggy and killed Vader.  Then Qui-Gon moved over in front of 2 scrub imperials (the only 2 left on Ralltiir) and Luke docking bay transited over too.  A turn or so later I flipped Travis back and he was in a bad spot.  He chose to capture Luke with Admiral Motti so that he would be able to control 3 Ralltiir sites and flip to the backside of ROPS.  Mace (v) came out, and both my Jedi pretty much cut through the scrubs.  They were helped a lot by being able to sense the Outflank (v) that Travis was using to protect the weaker imperials.  I was worried that this game would go to time because Travis had some real hard decisions in it, but a couple beatdowns at the end helped it to be a full win.  2(+20 something again = 6(+70ish).  <br />
<br />
Highs:  Realizing I might be able to get one of the top places of the tournament.  How&#39;d I get in that situation? No clue... <br />
Lows:  Travis not having time to update his deck to counter IWYT(v).<br />
<br />
Game 4: my crappy about to lose DS Clouds deck vs. Travis&#39; Profit<br />
So at the beginning of game 3, I was very happy to be playing the guy I thought would win with my good deck, as I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to beat him with my bad one.  Well, now I had to try it anyway.  Before the game, I could tell that Travis&#39; loss in the last round had been a pretty hard hit.  Being undefeated and losing with a deck that had brought you a couple big tournament wins I guess does that.  He seemed down psychologically, and I think that really helped me out this game.  For me, realizing that even if I lost I&#39;d still have a good shot at one of the top spots was a nice boost.  When I saw he was playing Profit I knew there were a few things to worry about (as I&#39;d worked a lot on Profit myself).  I was thinking he&#39;d chose to go 1 of 3 routes:  1) Harvest/On the Edge retrieval while doing ping damage in a non-interactive game.  2) Deploy minimally to Tatooine (a couple guys to the Audience Chamber) to rescue Han and drain/ping every turn while using the rest of the characters to attack on ground in Cloud City.  3)  Deploy an army on Tatooine and Nabrun over to Cloud City for the beats.  Luckily, he wouldn&#39;t have been playing HC&F to try to fight me in the clouds.  I decided I&#39;d save my grabber shield for any retrieval interrupt, and if I was able to pull anymore grabbers from under Fear is My Ally I could use those how I wanted.  Then I&#39;d have to get out Imperial Decree (v), and play conservatively on ground until I was sure he wouldn&#39;t have Nabrun.  Well, that is basically how the game went.  I got out Imp Decree v quickly, first turn Executor, minimal TIE setup in the clouds, and some light ground forces.  I got to verify his deck once and saw that a Japanese Nabrun was there.  He ended up losing it off the top of his deck (4th card lost out of the 4 total he had to lose; tough luck).  No plan A, no plan B, no plan C, and a win for me.  2(+20ish)=8(+90ish).<br />
<br />
Highs:  Knowing the options he had for his deck and how to play against them.<br />
Lows:  It was a somewhat non-interactive game...?<br />
<br />
Game 5:  my TIGIH vs Nick&#39;s I&#39;m Sorry (v) Clouds.<br />
I was really confident going into this game, since my light deck owns my Clouds deck.  I thought for sure that I&#39;d have an easy win here.  Turns out though that it was the hardest game of the day for me.  Nick&#39;s I&#39;m Sorry (v) deck is significantly different than mine.  For one thing, he uses guns in the clouds, so my HC&F was mostly negated.  Secondly, he used 3 v13 cards that could hurt me: the shield (abyss), watch your back (v), and the  atat site with non-unique atats.  The possibility of him having fully immune to attrition atats was not good for me, as my smoke screens would be rendered useless.  Luckily he had some hard times getting them set up (it is card intensive I guess).  At the same time, I had trouble drawing either Mace or Qui-Gon (I never got one all game despite using 3p0whps every turn and drawing a lot).  So I had to use my Obi that should have gone out of play to fight instead.  What was good though was the Luke was at the docking bay all game draining for 2 and retrieving 1 every turn.  That really helped.  On the bad side, when I did deploy HC&F to the clouds, it would just get owned by his guns.  I made him deploy a good amount of cards though (Ties & guns) fighting it, so it was definitely worth it.  Padme came in huge again this game, providing the last bit of damage I needed to pull out the win.  2(+10)=10(+100 something).  <br />
<br />
Highs:  Playing an intense game that could have gone either way.<br />
Lows: One turn I had to be the rules stickler, which I normally don&#39;t do when I play Nick (we play all the time).  Whatever to win, right?!<br />
<br />
Game 6: ......<br />
So at this point, Henry tells me I can&#39;t lose, as everyone else has 2 losses.  I am stoked and just worried about the final confrontation.  Henry decides to give me the bye, since everybody else could fight for a higher place (except of course, whoever was in 2nd place), which I was glad to get because I could take an hour and relax to prepare to play heads up.  At the end of the round, Travis was in 2nd, and he elected not to play the final confrontation (he already has a worlds bye).  I was really glad because, although I had beaten him soundly twice already, I think he still would have had a shot since he is a good player and I think I had some lucky draws in our games.<br />
<br />
So I won a tournament foil EPP Maul, which is sweet because I didn&#39;t even own a normal one before the tournament.  Everybody also got some premiere and reflections packs (thanks PC!).<br />
<br />
Afterwards, we decide to play a 4 round sealed deck tournament (Jabba&#39;s Palace decks), which sound like fun.  So me and Nick are talking and having a good time building our decks for a while before the games begin, and I pull some decent cards.  2 normal skiffs to go with the racing one, some skiff masters, some Chevin, Ephant Mon, Bib, Scum and Villainy, and Bubo.  No Audience Chamber though, but Nick reminds me a lot of LS players will be playing it so I use it anyway (didn&#39;t ever get to play it though!).  I&#39;m not going to go through all the games, I&#39;ll just give some high/low points.  Okay, I got 3 wins and a timed loss.  The timed loss was to Henry, and it was a real fun game that was just starting to get good when it went to time, as I was about to play Scum and Villainy and my Bubo had just started killing his Baragwins (which were at the Bo Shuda&#39;d audience chamber).  That game and my game against Nick both began with a turn 1 sandwhirl making my characters go missing.  How gay.  I beat Nick because he didn&#39;t know skiffs could react.  Whoops.  I beat two other people (random guys from Alabama who hadn&#39;t played the game in a while) because I beat them down a lot.  Dropping 3 guys at 3 exterior sites first/second turn and reacting with a racing skiff/mercenary pilot is pure evil.  Getting Mighty Jabba, Bib, Ephant Mon, and a Mercenary Pilot on the same skiff is even moreso.  3 battle destinies that are +2 each?  I can react to any exterior site while my Bubo eats anyone of his trying to drain at interior sites?  That&#39;s gg folks.  And I slipped by Damian in the last round for the tournament win, after he lost to Nick.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was a really fun day of swccg.  I am really surprised I won, because even afterwards, I see a ton of areas I need improvement in.<br />
