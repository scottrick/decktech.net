<br />
Pre-Tourny aka long so dont have to read it..... <br />
<br />
Well this all starts last week sometime while checking up on the listserv.  I see that there is a tourny next Saturday (Easter weekend) in Modesto and the all mighty Kevin Shannon will be there and in full force.  As my spring break comes to an end and school begins again I start questioning my ds deck (and I shoulda made a better one) so during the week I talk to Peter Nordstrom some and other people about a good dark deck.  I decide to stick with the same deck as the prior 2 weeks for both sides since the LS was good with a few minor interrupt changes (It Can Wait errata wtf).  Well this week felt long...... really long like 2 weeks.  With Friday rolling around and all my first week &quot;jitters&quot; are over the day ends and I head home for some good ole deck building.  Knowledge.......You know how people say you learn something every day??  Well I learned something Friday.  If I am going to win I need to spend more time building decks.  Now you all remember that so you dont learn the hard way.  Anyways I was planning on going home Friday and spending like 6 hours building a good dark side.  Problem.... My friend gives me a burned cd with the game Day of Defeat on it.  So that plan is scratched and I end up playing &quot;DoD&quot; all afternoon and into the evening.  I get bored of it after a while and notice that its already 11 o&#146;clock.  BAD.  So since Im a lazy bum..... Im sure most of you are too... I decide to stick with the Dark Side with some changes and hope for the best since it has been good lately.  I get to sleep around 1 after cleaning up my cards (long long long long long and gay story).  Wake up..... eat food........ make final deck check.......... leave.  I get there really early since my dad had some family thing with lots of adults.  So Im hanging around the store during peak Pokemon Leauge hours.......... CRAP!!@!@!  I swear I almost went insane and it smelled so bad I had to go outside for fresh air.  Well people start arriving around 12:20 or so and we hang outside while the people clear out.  12:35..... Mr.  Shannon gets there and some of us go in there to help with decks.....  Then the 1st funniest thing of the day happens.  Kevin and me have something going with our moms and &quot;blowing&quot; for you youngers Im not gonna say what it is so this will be 1 degree less funny to you and well dad will tell u during the &quot;talk&quot;.  So I give him my &quot;Blow Parried&quot; signed by my mom and we laugh and laugh while he gives me a &quot;Glancing Blow&quot; signed by his mom.  This all started when Ref 3 first came out and we were at the first Ref 3 tourny and as Kevin looked through the cards he was talking smack on my mom and then saw &quot;Blow Parried&quot; and said &quot;Yea Kyle your mom tried to play this on me last night but i canceled it!!!&quot;  and we laughed more.  But anyways.  Kevin and Danny Mo build their decks while I stand outside more and talk to Peter.  We start around 1 with around 12 people there.<br />
<br />
Decks<br />
DS:  Combat Racing WhooHoo<br />
LS:  Combat Hardcore mega 0wnag3<br />
<br />
long....... weird huh<br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
<br />
DS vs Kevin &quot;action man&quot; Shannons WYS Racing aka &quot;I eat asians kids for dinner and *beep* their mom&quot;<br />
<br />
Well theres not much I can say about this game so itll be short.  This sucks I have to play Kevin first but it was prolly the funnest game Ive had in a while.  We start off....... activate 1....ACTION!!!  Kevin plays We Wish to board at once.... activate 2.... ACTION!!!  Kevin plays something else.  active 3, 4 and so on.  I start the race and flash his guy and draw a low destiny..... something I see lots of on my racer the whole day.  Goo Nee Tay prevents me from deploying anything so I pick up some.  Kevins turn.  activate 1.... ACTION!! Kyle plays Masterful Move..... Activate 2, 3 and so on and this goes on for the rest of the game.... it was quite funny.  He flips first turn with Melas and Theron Nutt to his Dbay and Cantina he draws.  We race.... low and I drop Emperor and Janus to one of my sites.  He sets up Theron Nutts ship and Phylo comes down and the ship flies up.  He it could be worses my drain and play step backwards on my racer which I grab(????).  His turn drains for some and Luke and Han come down against Emp and Janus(bad feeling made the beatdown a little easier).  I zap Luke and play I have you now against han(would be wore stuff cept draw their fire was out)  which was a problem rest of game.  He loses Han since my destinys suck.  More ships and guys come out for him.  Theres really not much more to say.  He wins the race.... clears whatever characters I had on tatooine and drains me at Kessel.   All I can say is Combat vs WYS is bad matchup and i got owned by Kevin and the deck.  FL(-35)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Having a fun game with Kevin<br />
Lows:  35 man thats gonna be a feat<br />
<br />
Game 2<br />
<br />
LS vs Adrian Somethings HD Dueling without No Escape<br />
<br />
This is not a good matchup for him...... and he doesnt know how to play against it... I think.  He starts Mobil Points/You cannont Hide, IAO/SP and Crush.  I get a preety descent hand with the Council fetcher card and card that grabs threepio.  He activates and I kill his mobil points with DDTA Shield.  Happens he doesnt play Rendilli or Carida anyways.  First turn he drops Vader with Saber to his just deployed CC Dbay along with D* Dbay from hand.  So I get Threepio and activate 8.  I grab the chamber and drop Threepio there.  Sac Insights for Honor.  Threepio for Qui-Gon(SWEET!!!) and play Qui with a saber from my deck.  Honor comes down and I only lose from Visage a total of 3 or 4 times.  No drains with vader and Blockade Flagship Dbay comes out.  I set up on my planet mostly with Mace at one site and Qui at the other as I drain away and he doesnt..... and he cant deploy much since Goo Nee Tay is out.  Later in the game.  Maul comes down against Qui-Gon and Mara against Yoda.  He battles Qui but Qui makes quick work of him and I its a trap the Mara Battle.  I death finger Mara and drain for 4 more.  Mistake I make.  I decide to go to his sites......... and Well Obi almost gets Circled but I had jedi relisenace and Blue Milk so he only had 1 destiny.  I end up getting around his dueling and he dies out to my drains after I hit a edge for 6.  FW(+23)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Plinking away at the 35<br />
Lows:  I forgot how to track important cards.......... WTF<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
<br />
LS vs Eric Shannons Mkos I play slow like silly girl<br />
<br />
This was a preety fun game since Eric is a cool guy.... cept he plays like his brother (figure it out ^_^).  He starts Pwr of da Hutt, First Strike and No Bargin.  This I thought was going to be an easy game for me since he cant cancel my Naboo drains and I have plenty of evasion cards.  His turn he grabs the AC, sail barge from deck and the passenger deck for activation.  I get a great start with the Council Chamber and Threepio there.  Qui with his saber to the core for some fast drains.  He seearches for the other site but its not in there so I get early verifiction.  Only 1 maul in there....nuts.  He uses AC text for Mighty Jabba and puts a random scrub there using Scum and Viliany.  I drain and drop Mace to the other Naboo site and set up my hand.  He gets his Final site out this turn and flips with some guys to the sail barge and some to the lower passageways.  I drain and drop Bousssh into the AC.  Galid come outs alot with Ref 3 Bib fortuna with Myo to the AC and Ephant Mon to the lower passages.  I had Boussh in the passageways blocking up that big drain and decide to attack his guys.  I have alot of force left since No Bargin is weakss.  I play Luke and Obi to the AC with some really high destiny in my dec.  I sense a None Shall Pass which forces out There is no try along with Serect Plans and the Grabber.  For me Aim High and Battle Plan.  I battle in the AC and chop up Galid and Bib killing Jabba to a 7 destiny and Resilence Obi back to my hand.  After I clear the site I pay 4 to cancel his Scum making everything expensive.  I Dodge Luke to Jp while tons of his guys come down.  Maul mostly to the AC with Boba and DrE combo.  I drain for 6 and he goes.  Dengar with gun comes down against Luke with Guri sitting there.  I go.  I drain him to 2 cards left.  Battle Retreive 1 he loses 1.  I blaster deflect the shot and he draws out next turn.  FW(+29)<br />
<br />
Highs:  POSITIVE BABY!!<br />
Lows:  Last game even though we were pose to go 6<br />
<br />
Game 4<br />
<br />
DS vs Clayton Atkins WYS Han+Chewie = A dead asian<br />
<br />
This was a preety exciting game.  Hes playing basic WYS with Han-Pizzed Chewie-Life Debt battle damage.  I start the race and stall his pod...... He sure does get a kick outa that.  I drop the bridge from my hand and Emperor to the site for some early drains.  He grabs a Dbay and Kessel and drops Mirax in Pular to Kessel.  He drains there for the rest of the game.  Melas also goes to the Cantina for the quick flip.  I drain and cover his site up with Arica and the Spies stay around for the rest of the game.  Race destinys are sucking preety bad here.  I try to take out Melas and Its a Traped everytime even with that Anti Smuggler Card out.  I win the race and he It could be worses the damage.  After that we play cat and mouse for a a while with Luke and Han Running from Arica and Kedar the black.  His drains in space are eating away at me slowing but surely.  Im not activating enough for much other than 1 drain and if i have to deploy something then that.  I clear off Luke some time and the game comes down to this battle.  He has Han alone at Mos Espa Dbay with Vader in front of him.  Chewie Enrageds drops down but I luckily barrier, he loses 1 to send him to used.  Im sitting there with 2 cards in my hand which were Choke Vader and his Saber.  Me being a idiot I am, I battle with the Vader with saber instead of converting him.  Life Debt Chewie comes out.  3 Destiny for him 1 for me add 2 to his and he hits Vader with han to top that off.  And well I lose.  FL(-12)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Fun game cept now time for a new dark side<br />
Lows:  2-2 wtf now im mad <br />
<br />
Well I suck and might as well have came in last place.  Kevin ends up winning by 1 diff.(timewins suck) and Adrian Seymour comes in second.  After the tourny I play a game against Peters Ls.  Heres a battle that happens in my generator core.  He has Princess Leia, Melas, Lando Scoundrel, and a couple of 4-2 guys (i think panaka and guy from theed that prevents queeny from getting hit) and I have Maul with Double, 4-Lom with conc, Vader with saber and Iggy.  Leia, Melas and Lando go down the shoot and Iggy grabs that random scrub.  I draw double destiny and beat teh crap outa panaka.  I win in another battle a few turns later.  After that Peter, Adrian, Marc (Peters Stepbrother who talks lots of mess) and me all head down to Fosters Freeze to talk some tech and get some games on.  I beat Adrian by 11 or something and beatdown on Marcs DS Combat.  All in all prolly the funnest day Ive had at a wars tourny but a horrible performance.  Props and slops<br />
<br />

Kevin:  You are that damn good<br />
Clayton:  Beatdown on me after a few losses hehe<br />
