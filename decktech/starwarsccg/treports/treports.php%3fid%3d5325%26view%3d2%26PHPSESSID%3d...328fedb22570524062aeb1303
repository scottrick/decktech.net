But preparation started a few weeks before.  <br />
<br />
A few weeks ago:<br />
For a warm up for this event I held a mini open at a convention in Butler, not many people showed, but it still was a success.  At the time I thought I would stick with the decks I had played at that tournament, WYS and My Maul deck.  But after listening to R. Smith I decided to change my decks to the Broken Dark Deck, that is all I am going to say, so unless you did not see it, sorry but your out of luck, and Agents Of The Court, so after playtesting with R. Smith and against myself, I felt I was ready.<br />
<br />
Friday:<br />
After Reid got off work and I was finished with my class we packed up the R. Smith One and travelled down to Maryland.  The only incident we had during the trip was a minor accident on 70.  So we finally rolled into Nick&#39;s place, Reid&#39;s roommate from college.  We unpacked the car and then went for a bite to eat in this little dinner down the street.  The food was good, omelets for dinner is a great thing.  So after that we went back to Nick&#39;s for some Gamecube, Reid sucks at Soulcaliber II so he is up for grabs, and some playtesting my light against his dark.  After that is was bed for the big day.<br />
<br />
Saturday:<br />
After we got up and showered we went over to Penn Station to pick up two guys from the train station who were coming in from New York, sorry guys I dont remember your names.  We were then on our way to Renaissance Games.  We pulled in around 11:45 for the tournament and filled out our deck lists and it was time to start the games.<br />
<br />
For the first match up I was paired against Drew Scott, who I had met at PA States in 2004 and then again at Origins this last summer.  For the tournament he was playing a Bring Him Before Me deck and an Agents deck, so I kinda figured he was teched against Agents:<br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
Drew Scott<br />
Bring Him Before Me <br />
Starting:<br />
Ability, Ability, Ablility (V)<br />
Your Destiny<br />
Insignficant Rebellion<br />
IO & Secret Plans<br />
His Name Is Anakin<br />
First turn he deployed Empy Palpatine to the Antechamber.  I then got out Yerka Mig (V), Ellors Madak (V) and five different aliens, including Tanus Spijek to the Throne Room.  His turn he drained me for 1 at the Antechamber and then deployed Vader with Stick to the throne room and battled.  He hit Tanus, but that was all I had to lose, while I just had to lose Tanus.  My next turn I put out a few more characters and flipped and I put out Tusken Breath Mask.  His next turn he deployed spaceport docking bay and blizzard 4 and then got out vader and sando aqua monster.  I battled Empy and got rid of him, but I had to clear the site, thank you Force Lightning and Sando Aqua Monster.  So everytime I battled he would draw off of Sando and then he would battle me and continue to retrieve Lando with AAA (V).  So the battles and Your Destiny took me to the end, even though I was retrieving 1-2 a turn.<br />
Full Loss -17<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Set up first turn <br />
Not a bad game against a bad match up and a game I did not playtest.<br />
Cons:<br />
Sando His Name is Anakin and Your Destiny... cards of death<br />
<br />
So after this game I found out Reid also lost his first game, a timed lose by 1 card.  <br />

Game 2<br />
For this match up I got to play the first game with my broken deck.  But I had to play against the guy who beat Reid.<br />
<br />
Brad Eirer<br />
Throne Room Mains<br />
Colo Claw Fish<br />
Civil Disorder (V)<br />
Insurrection & Ain High<br />
Not a good match up for me, and looking in my opening hand I found the only good card I had was the Rodian (V).  He got out a few of his twixs and it was my turn.  I looked through my deck for the Audience Chamber, but it was not in there so I drew a few cards.  He did the same.  My next turn I got out the chamber and deployed baby jabba along with Lando, Bib, Bane and J&#39; Quille.  His next turn he deployed Luke with Saber and Qui-Gon with Saber.  He battled and got rid of most of my guys.  The rest of the game I couldnt really do anything. <br />
Full Lose -24<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Not many<br />
Cons:<br />
The entire game<br />
<br />
So at this point I am really low in the tournament.  It was time to play my butt off.<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
For this game I place paired against possibly the oldest person in the tournament.  So I kinda felt confident in my abilities, even though he was playing Hunt Down, a deck that hurts Agents.<br />
<br />
Chris Westergard<br />
Hunt Down Racing<br />
Visage <br />
Your Eyes Can Deceive You<br />
Hmmm an interesting starting effect.  So he starts the race, and I choose not to play in the race and pulled the shield.  He really didnt do anything, just made me lose to Visage.  My turn I deployed a crap load of aliens, including Jar Jar to the Holothreatre to cancel Visage.  Next turn he came down with Janus to get rid of Jar Jar, thank you Tusken Breath Mask (V).  He also deployed Maul to the Antechamber, which was fine by me.  My next turn I got the rest of my guys out and flipped and deployed a Tatooine: Desert.  Next turn, this was one of his mistakes he made, he deployed Blizzard 4 and Vader with Stick to the Desert.  My turn I deployed the Tank and Droopy to the Desert.  But before this I got a sandwhirl out of my Force Pile with Control & Tunnel Vision.  I deployed it and then battled Blizzard 4.  It seemed like the old guy did not believe me after every move I made, making me recount my power like I was cheating him.  So he loses Blizzard 4 and Droopy goes to the tank.  He deploys Emperor to the racing arena and gets out URrRrRRRs Bantha and URrRrRRR to the arena and the race ends, he retrieves.  So I am retrieving and draining him, he does not pull Resistance or Battle Order the entire game. He does move Maul over and finds Vader who then battles Droopy both are lost, Droppy to the tank.  So Empy goes missing, the Tusken and Bantha are lost and I have control in three different sites, so I am out draining, retrieving and getting rid of his guys on the table.<br />
Timed Win +23<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
At one point in the game I am looking for a card and deploy it but am continuing to look through my deck, and the guy is trying to use Thrown Back! (V) game text, and I stop him, but he is arguing with me because I deployed a card I cannot look through my deck unless I am attempting to pull or deploy something.  I am thinking to myself, is this guy for real, and I say because the deck is in my hand I can look through it as I please, so he calls Kevin, the tournament director, over and explains his complaint to Kevin, well Kevin rules in my favor and the old guy gets mad.  So tick him off more I take the next few seconds and just look throughout my deck talking to myself about how I can pull this or this or this It was fun<br />
Sending Vader and Empy missing, HUGE<br />
Canceling Visage FIRST TURN<br />
Cons:<br />
Playing someone who thought you were cheating the entire game<br />
<br />
Yay, my first win, even though it was a timed win I will take it.  I am still low so more scrubs<br />
<br />
Game 4<br />
Michael Phelps<br />
Agents In The Court<br />
Bargaining Table (V)<br />
Yar dal (V)<br />
Wokling (V)<br />
Uh-Oh! (V)<br />
I see what he is playing and immediately apologize to him for the up coming beatdown.  First turn I get EVERYTHING I deploy baby jabba, audience chamber, bane, jquille and bib, The Ebb Of Battle and activate 10 force, get the rodian out and then Iggy (V).  So he does his thing and gets out Tusken, Yerka Mig and Bo Shuda and he has 5 guys at the chamber.  During his turn I get out Dr. E & Ponda Baba.  Next turn I get Dr. Es Blaster.  His next turn he spreads out to another site and I get Sniper Combo and deploy the doctor and his gun.  His turn he flips and gets the Tatooine system and gets Ellorrs Madak out.  My turn, during my control phase I use Sniper combo to clear the chamber with Dr. E and his gun, what a great combo, and I also cancel Yerka Mig and Tusken Breath Mask.  He deploys Wattos Junkyard and Lando in Ship, but he still does not have 5 aliens out and no breath mask, so I get Bossk in bus.  Next turn I take out Lando and eat his drain, I also replace baby jabba with Jabba the Slut.  His turn he drains and that is it.  My turn I drain in space and get a card, what is it you ask, Elis Helrot, cause he has four characters at Jundland Wastes, so I Elis over and battle, first thing I do is get rid of Laudica, cause his other three characters are ability 1, double their power and hit him for 47 battle damage.  Game<br />
Full Win +22<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Clearing the chamber<br />
The 47 battle damage<br />
First win with broken deck<br />
Cons:<br />
Oola makes Zuckuss and Maul go lost<br />
<br />
2-2 at this point with a minor shot at the finals, sweet<br />
<br />
Game 5<br />
Hunter Roney<br />
Court of the Vile Gangster Racing<br />
The Hutts Are Gangsters<br />
Hmm interesting, but it gets better.  He deploys RIII Jabba to the arena and starts the race.  He is not playing Scum My turn I get out all my stuff, and five aliens, the only thing I am missing is Yerka Mig, I flip and am in good shape.  His next turn he deploys Vader with stick to the chamber, ok and then PCP Fett to the chamberinteresting he then initiates battle, and I was like uh no, read Bo Shuda.  Then he wants to take back both Fett and Vader, so I call over Kevin, and am like, what should I do, but he tells me it is up to me.  Me being the nice guy I am I let him take back Fett and only Fett, but I shoulnt have cause at that point, he had one force left, thus not enough to keep Fett in play.  So he move Vader over to the Antechamber.  My next turn I deploy to the Dungeon and get other guys out to the Desert.  He deploys to Mara with Stick and Dr. E Combo to the Antechamber after he drains.  My next turn I spread out at the deserts and the cantina which I deploy, after I drain for one.  He deploys Maul to the Dungeon and battles, we clear the site.  I drain him for a lot and retrieve some.  This goes on for a little more, with a few battles involving Maul, which he retrieves with the race, and Jabba.  I out drain him and retrieve a lot each time.  <br />
Full Win +27<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Got to love drains of 9 a turn<br />
Wheeling Droopy off the tank<br />
Cons:<br />
People not knowing their cards<br />
<br />
Well I am standing at 3-2 and the worse I can do it 3-3 which is great.  Reid on the other hand is 2-3, with three loses to his light side Throne Room Mains.<br />
<br />
Game 6<br />
Zach Tartell<br />
Hidden Base Racing<br />
Rebel Planners (V)<br />
What is with all the racing, and my dark without the racing shield.  First turn, again I set up, with baby jabba, jquille, bib, and URuR to the chamber with the Rodian and Iggy to the Security tower.  His turn he deploys some systems, and I then Uncertain Is The Future him, he gets mad I like.  He then gets out Projection of a Skywalker to the chamber, gay.  My next turn I get a card with Iggy, Maul I think, his turn he deploys Luke with Stick and Qui-Gon with stick to the chamber and battles, he loses both and I lose JQuille, Bane and URuR.  He sets up in space and I go up and follow with Maul, Sith Infiltrator, Zuckuss, Mist Hunter and PCP Fett, this goes on for a while and a few battles occur, and he houjixs the damage away.  He then deploys, Spiral, an X-wing, Obi, which I barrier, and Lando, and battles against Maul, he draws two destiny and forces me to lose Maul, and the part that sucks is that I have my Lando out, so he should not have been able to battle me.  The game goes on with me casing him in space and him deploying Boushh to the Tower, and getting rid of the Rodian.  The game then times out, with me winning by 1 card<br />
Timed Win +21<br />
<br />
Pros: <br />
The first turn set up<br />
Cons:<br />
Not realizing my Lando was out<br />
No racing shield<br />
<br />
So the tournament is over and I stand at 6 victory point and a differential of +52, not bad, not bad at all, good enough for 8th place overall<br />
Reid on the other hand is 3-3, his light side, Throne Room Mains bombed big time, but he own each of his dark games by a crap load.<br />
<br />
So after the tournament Kevin hands out the prizes, I get an Alter foil, some EPPs, a General Grievous figure, in a drawing, and a pack of Tatooine and Cloud City for 8th.<br />
<br />
Kevin does some more drawings and such, while Reid talks to Greg Shaw and I talk to Mike Pistone, who signs my Melas and Jabba The Slut foils.<br />
Reid and I leave, only to get slowed down on the way back to Putzburgh in the rain, while we are still in Maryland and to get caught in some snow in the mountains.<br />
<br />
During the drive Reid calls up Kevin to find out who wins. Well with Greg Shaw, Drew Scott, James Booker and Brad Eier makes the finals, with Shaw winning.<br />
<br />
Good Things:<br />
Reid for driving down<br />
Nick for letting us stay at his place<br />
The great decks I played<br />
Melissa, just cause<br />
Getting all my homework done before hand<br />
Drew Scott for signing Droopy Spoony McCool<br />
Pistone for signing the Slut<br />
RMU meal plan for the snacks<br />
Omelets for dinner<br />
ATHF greatest show EVER<br />
MP3 Players<br />
Kevin for running the thing<br />
Renaissance Games for hosting<br />
God<br />
<br />
Bad Things:<br />
Almost going on Tortellini Tilt<br />
Forgetting my cards on table<br />
Bad draws<br />
Reid scrubing out<br />
The weather on the way back<br />
Forgetting everyone else who played, sorry guys<br />
