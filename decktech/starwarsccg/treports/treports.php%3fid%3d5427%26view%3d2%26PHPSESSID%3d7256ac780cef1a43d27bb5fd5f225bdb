<br />
EPISODE I<br />
<br />
THE SAGA BEGINS:  VICTORY AMONG THE AMISH<br />
<br />
	Hi everyone, Aglets here.  OK, so I guess I should put up my road to worlds story for all to seeI know people like to read these things, at least thats what I hear.  This will be a 3 part TR (an epic trilogy, as it were) that will take a place all around Gen Con 2005.  This first TR will chiefly encompass the Lancaster Open a week before Worlds, and then events that immediately lead up to the sacred tournament of tournaments.<br />
<br />
	So yeah, my tournament season for 2005 was filled with many disappointments you might say.  I missed the final confrontation at Mystic Visions 4.12 by a few differential.and then I had a pretty mediocre showing at the Yavin IV Regional.  I did better at MD states.but still not good enough to qualify.  At NJ states my LS went 3-0 and DS went 0-3 (although both me AND Greg Shaw know who shouldve won that game..;)   ).  So my WYS (v) was 6-0 at the last two tournaments, but I couldnt seem to win with any dark.<br />
	<br />
	Enter:  Lancaster.  Home of horses, buggies, men with long beards, and Dutch Wonderland.  This would be my last chance to qualify for Day 2 (other than Day 1 itself) so I was psyched and rarin to go.  I decided to change up my LS to Endor Mains, a deck I had been experimenting with for a bit.figuring everyone would have figured out how to beat wys V.  (This would turn out to be a good call as the top decks could and were beating it that day).  For dark I decided to go with the flow..and play what I knew could win..everyones favorite Pistone/Schele/Reid Combat Readiness (v) Scum (with a few special modifications of course).  <br />
<br />
	So when the day comes, I pick up local SW enthusiast Jeff Johns and we make the trek to Six Feet Under Games.  Props to AAA Trip Tik for making maps and directions that just make Map Quest look like a big n00b.  So we get there pretty early, I think only Mike Carr was there at that time.  Later such characters as Bill Kafer, Drew Scott, Ben Klein, Rory Dibeler, the 2 Bhaskers, Jacob Bennett, (who brought his crazy SYCFA that has been made available for all to see on DT), VA state champ Jon Westergard, dynamic_dogg, and many others.  I think there were around 18 altogether.  <br />
	Mike has to leave to pick up someone at the train station, so the tournament doesnt exactly start in a timely fashion.  But thats cool, when do they ever?  Lol<br />
<br />
	So yeah, maybe 30-45 minutes late, Mike calls out the rounds and its time to get our game on!  This is my last chance to not scrub out to take home the bye.<br />
<br />
	Round 1:  My Endor mains vs.  Yankees hat guys Tusken Raider deck<br />
<br />
	I really do apologize that I dont remember your name, I really shouldve written this report awhile ago I guess.  I wanna say this was Jeremiah?   But Im not 100% sure.<br />
<br />
	So anyway, I start endor and 2 sites, with Launching the Assault, Quick Draw (v), Strike Planning, and Civil Disorder (v) I think.  He does combat Readiness V on Tatooine for the Audience chamber and the Jundland wastes I think.  He also starts Krayt Dragon Bones (v), Bantha Herd (v), and 2 others.  In the beginning he tells me that this is just a fun theme deck and that he doesnt think itll do well.  <br />
	Despite his comment, this game made me a bit nervous in the beginning as I really had no idea what to expect.  The presence of creatures also makes me want to wait a bit to set up my guys on Endor.  He eventually gets like a crapload of Banthas and Raiders to his exterior site, ready for a drain of like 6 with Herd V and UroRuRRRRRs Bantha (v).  I drop Leia Rebel Princess, to the audience chamber, figuring shell buy me some much needed time while I set up on Endor.  I slowly get my mains and toys out on Endorand I dont think we ever interact.  Thats One (v) is the r0x0rs and makes me feel safe in spreading out.  By the time I get Capital Support (tech!) set up Im dealing like 7-8 damage a turn or more.  Leia keeps canceling his drain on Tatooine, and then I move her in front of a bunch of aliens to simply control the site.  At one point he drops a battle droid on me (the one that makes jedi deploy +4) to try and surprise Leia, but I just used thats one V to save her.  The big damage does him in and I win by 20 or so.  Come to find out he runs a desert and an actual Krayt Dragon (both come to Endor) but the dragon cant leave the desert thankfully.<br />
<br />
Props:  To Jeremiah (assuming that is indeed his name) for being a cool opponent, despite liking the Yankees.  Leia, Rebel Princess is amazing, and Thats one (v) is crazy good.<br />
<br />
Slops:  none come to mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
	So far Im off to a good start, lets just hope that I dont scrub out as per usual in the next round.<br />
<br />
Round 2 :  My Scum vs. Joe Streleckiss Tatooine Careful Planning (v) deck<br />
<br />
	I believe I started All Wrapped Up (v), Jabbas Influence (v), Power of the Hutt, and Krayt (v).  He starts the Outskirts and the site where you get drain bonuses for having vaporators.  For effects he started Saitorr (v) and Squassin, at the moment I cant remember the other two.<br />
<br />
	This game was essentially as one would have predicted.  I build up with a bunch of people at the Audience Chamber, he gets Mace (v) out early, and also he gets out a Vaporator and stuff so he can drain for like 21534534 at that site.  Thats not good for me.  I get Arica out to stop that silliness.  He puts out Corran Horn but doesnt break Aricas cover..hmmmmm.  <br />
	Space doesnt go all that well for me, he eventually gets Wedge and Porkins up there, and I think Bright Hope?  Or some other ship so he could get an ability 4 pilot up there to stop Maul.  I believe I had Boba Fett on the ground so its hard for me to draw the extra destinies in space to get around Wedge.  On the ground there really only was one momentous battle.where I rushed a lone mace, made him power 0, and beat him for 12 overflow.  He opted to keep mace out tho (stupid immunity) and lost 12 from deck.  Eventually I point out to him (because Im a cool guy on occasion) that Corran could mess up Aricas whole undercover thang.  He seems mildly surprised.but a few turns later he dances Corran around so that he can pull it off.  This game just wasnt very interactive after that and it kinda draggedon.  Keeping Mace V alive and breaking Aricas cover made this a bit closer than I wouldve liked.and despite my best efforts this game goes to time.  Sux0rrzzzzzzzzzz.<br />
<br />
TW of maybe like 10ish.<br />
<br />
Props:  To Joe for making cool decks ( I remember at Visions last December he played a spiffy Ral Ops Stormtrooper deck).  To Hutt Bounty (v) for being silly.  And to Arica.<br />
<br />
Slops:  Yeah, timing isnt cool<br />
<br />
Well, Im 2-0 at this point as is Bennett, Jon Westergard, and some others probably.  <br />
<br />
Time for game 3.<br />
<br />
Round 3 :  My Scum vs. John Fergusons Pliable Wood WYS (V)  (its posted on DT by the way)<br />
<br />
Ah, the deck that everyone loves to hate.  Well at least, back before the v11 preview cards everyone had PLENTY of not-so-nice things to say about it.  Fortunately, I was expecting to see such a matchup today, so I figured I was ready.  I start the same old as before..creatures are tech.  He starts Civil Disorder V, Klorslug V, and Colo.  So yeah, I set up my stuff.he takes stuff into hand with his objective.  I get out Prince Xizor (v) (so huge!  Friends dont let friends use the non-v Xizor in scum) and Unexpected Interruption early on.  That in turn gets used to get Look Sir Droids, and I bury Leebo, who makes me sad when he keeps peeking at me.  The key to this game was keeping the pressure on in space.  I used C/SFS to get a bit of a beat to clear the sytem..at one point I just had Maul sitting at Corellia controlling it.  He never went to Kessel.  He puts like Laudica (v) an ithorian and maybe Han Solo V? on Corellia.  Bubo came down and had fun eating people.  All the while Im making him fight to keep his objective flipped (and retrieving with S & V, etc, I think he flipped back and forth like 4 times in the game) I have my damage rolling on Tatooine.  Bubo even got to eat Obi w/stick late in the game ( he drew the JCC for destiny iirc).  The real kicker was when I came down with Boba Fett (v), and p-59 I think and was capturing guys and causing damage.  The fact that I just never let him set up anywhere solidly in space or on the ground means that I win this one pretty handily.  I have a small lost pile at the end.<br />
<br />
Props:  Scum for battling a lot and retrieving a lot and killing stuff.  Bubo for proving once again that he can pwn LS mains like no other.<br />
Slops:  Ummm, Ill have to get back to you on that one<br />
<br />
So far so good, still undefeated.  I still dont think Jacob or Jon had lost by this point either.  They played each other in round 4 tho I believe.<br />
<br />
Round 4:  Endor Mains vs.  Vinay Bhaskers CR (v) Tat Scum<br />
<br />
I was wondering if I would have to play one of THESE decks.  Hopefully Im teched out enough for this matchup.  So yeah, you know what I start, and you certainly know what he starts.  In this game, I know that my biggest concern is Elis Helrot.  Without Elis, its going to be very difficult for him to drop a big beat on me.  I get Thats One (v) out for insurance.and I put out General Solo (v) with some other guy.  In two turns, Vinay has maybe 9 aliens at the Audience Chamber..and, sure enough, he plays that crazy Givin that can breathe in vacuums to transport his whole crew over for teh WIN!  I say that I was wondering how long it would take for him to find the Elis.<br />
<br />
He initiates battle with a smile on his face.he must outpower by at least 4 to 1  (not including the doubling).  Then I bust out some tech.  I Know brings down Leia RP for free and the entire battle is canceled!  He wants to barrier her, and I say ok since I wasnt planning on moving her on his turn anyway.<br />
<br />
Needless to say the game went a bit downhill for him after that.  I got Mace (v) to Tatooine, canceled scum, and essentially spread and drained there.  He dropped Maul eventually to lay a beat on Leia, but Thats One (v) saved her, and I Nabrun some people off of Endor since I can drain for more on Tatooine.  I grab Elisand since he has like a bazillion people on table I know that he wont be able to drop any big beats on me anytime soon as a surprise.  He does get another Elis off to try and get a big beat on Luke, RS (v), (he makes him power 0 and causes a difference of like 20 or something) but I have out Savrip so its all good.  Luke stays on table.  The game ends pretty closely, but I maintain a solid presence in space with the super Home One (Evacuation control (v) means its virtually impossible to kill) and Capital Support is huge in causing more damage.  He gets some decent drains on me on Endor tho, so I dont win by much.<br />
<br />
Props:  To Leia, Rebel Princess for being one of the best anti Scum cards ever.  I Know is good.Savip is goodand super Home One is fun.<br />
Slops:  Umm, I guess Scum is still brutal and all.but I play it too so its all good.<br />
<br />
Well Im 4-0 and feeling pretty good about my odds at getting the bye.  Jacob beats Jon so now I think he and I are the only undefeateds left.<br />
<br />
Round 5:  Endor Mains vs. Jacob Bennetts SYCFA  (3-0 PA Open SYCF-WHAAAAAT?  on Decktech)<br />
<br />
Hmmm, not to sure what to expect in this matchup.but I expect that its going to be close.  A take a bit too long setting up on Endor.Im just too darn cautious I guess.  Jacob wastes little time, dropping Kiffex and Nal Hutta early, getting out Fear (v) for big damage too.  I see him lose a Lateral Damage to one of my drains, and I know that hes running like Overwhelmed and stuff and that that + lateral damage = game over for super Home One.  <br />
<br />
Once I see him lose the Lat Dmg, I figure that his odds of getting double the power of Home One + ackbar are pretty slim.  I deploy the Home One to Endor, knowing that if I cant satisfy Battle Order I have no chance of winning whatsoeverand that I am fast running out of time.  (Im losing like 8 a turn at least from Fear and drains).  If I had waited maybe one more turn I wouldve had Haashn for lat dmg securitybut he already lost it right?<br />
<br />
Wrong.  His turn he drops two star destroyers on me, lateral damages the H1, and Overwhelms it.  Well, I learned my lessonthe hard way.  At that point all I can do is spread and hit him for maximum drainswhich are far less than his maximum drains + fear damage.  I think at the end I lost like 12 a turn or something.  We never battled all game.oh well.<br />
<br />
My drains across Endor keep him close tho, and he ends up with a win by 9.<br />
<br />
Props:  To Jacob for building and playing a solid, solid deck.  Very innovative too, if I had the cards I might try it out myself.  This deck is good, its a shame he didnt post it before Gen Con, I bet it wouldve been played there.<br />
<br />
Slops:  To me for not thinking about a 2nd Lateral Damage.  If I had waited for Haashn (or simply known that I just needed to put a Jedi on the freakin cruiser) it couldve been a whole different ballgame.<br />
<br />
Well, now Im 4-1, and if I want the bye I absolutely have to win the next game.  Its still me, Jon, and Jacob at the top.Jacob is the only undefeated left.<br />
<br />
Round 6:  My Scum vs. Jacob Bennetts TRM<br />
<br />
Yay, we get to play again.  He starts The Camp, Insurrection combo, and Civil Disorder (v) I think.  For some reason I have a bad feeling when I see him start The Camp, drop Goo first turn, and play Escape Pod (v) to get Grimtaash.  No Molator (v) for me.  Hmmm, this is gonna be interesting.  I have just enough to deploy Jabba the Hutt (v) on my turn and have a force saved for evasion purposes.  After judging that he doesnt have enough force for any funny business (No Bargain = good) I decide to go ahead and do it.  He comments that that was a brave move.  <br />
<br />
With Hutt Bounty (v) out, I get the activation I need to reinforce the audience chamber despite all the crazy silly cards he has on the table.  I dont believe he ever rushed the AC directly, but IIRC we did have some skirmishes at the exterior site.  I did make a slightly scrubbish play when he had Luke with Stick and Corran there.  I deploy Xizor (v)  (again, so huge) and epp dengar I think.  My plan was to do the Bubo trick to eat one of his dudesbut because of dengar corran was power 5.  Luke was power 0 and if I hadnt put Dengar there corran wouldve been easy to eat too.  Random selection fails me and Bubo does nothing there.  <br />
<br />
Xizor V and his awesomeness again gets me Look Sir Droids to bury Naked 3po.  (PWNZORED as some would say).  I love LSD.  (yes, I mean the card, you sickos.cant believe your minds would go there).  ;)<br />
Later in the game he uses Were you Looking For Me to retrieve 3PO and Im all liketech.  I didnt know that card could do all that and still manage to help out ewok decks!?!?!?  gg  That is a solid card.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the game I basically play defensively and wait for him to make a move, then go and beat him up.  He puts Mace Windu (v) with a jedi saber at the Coruscant docking bay to try and cause some damageI simply drop Arica and block the drain ALL GAME LONG.  I guess he lost the SATM combo early.  I get a pretty decent hold on space, he gets out Gold Leader in Gold one (v) against the space cruiser etc, and UroRuuruRRR v saves me from not being able to get a destiny.  Once I see him lose the Free Ride Combo, I set up Tatooine Occupation to put the icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
Props:  To Jacob for being a cool opponent, it was cool to meet him and stuff.  Arica deserves props, as does LSD (yes, the card, huge in 2 games today) and Were You Looking For Me.<br />
<br />
Slops:  Hmmm, none come to mind.altho the Camp isnt much fun.<br />
<br />
So I finish 5-1 with enough differential to make the Final Confrontation but the timed win forces me to stay in 3rd place.  I still get the bye since Jon is already VA state champ.tech.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Jon agree not to play, Jon gives up the rights to the v card design since he already has one coming..everyone is happy all around.<br />
<br />
I talk some tech with Drew, Rory, and Ben from PA (who will play much larger roles in later reports)  and we exchange info so that were ready for Indianapolis in ONE WEEK!  Drew already had his bye so he was just hanging out to see if Ben or Rory would get one, they dropped after like 4 rounds.<br />
<br />
So prizes are given out, Mike Carr gives us some new insights on the OK state scandal.(nothing that needs to be repeated)and then its time to go.  Jeff and I make a stop at the Bob Evans across the street before heading home.<br />
<br />
Did you know Amish people put lights on their buggies?  <br />
<br />
Anyway..time for final props and slops.<br />

<br />
