Directors Richard Buckner and Brett Kingery. HUGE 18 participants (yeah right).<br />
<br />
So this tourney wasn't as big as I was hoping it was gonna be, but no biggie. After prepping my decks all week and staying up till 5:30 the night before playing L5R RPG (thanks for the game Z), I get up around 930, grab a shower, and stroll over to the Frederick Douglass Dining Center for the big event. I didn't take as thorough notes as I usually do, but hopefully I can give ya'll a quality report.<br />
<br />
My LS: EPP Yoda w/Orange Snake from 1980, found off my member page, with a few modifications. If yer too lazy to look at it it's Test Farmboy to 5, retrieve, then kill, with direct damage and drain stoppers on the opponent while testing.<br />
<br />
My DS: A really stupid Hunt Down high-destiny dueling. I hate it, the deck sucks.<br />
<br />
So I'm one of the first there, and I sit around chatting with each new arrival. Most of em are locals, then in comes a mess of guys I don't know. I introduce myself to one of 'em, only to find that he's top-10 ranked Matt Sokol. He's there with the rest of his squad from cross-state in Albany. So I'm thinkin, 'Yeah, this tourney's gonna be huge,' but team Albany is the only major arrival from that point on. So we get down to business at about 1230, and I am paired against ...<br />
<br />
Mike from Albany's Tatooine drains with Scum, First Strike (I think), and ORSs, vs. my EPP Yoda<br />
He starts a Japanese Mos Eisley, CRs for the Audience Chamber. I go with MWYHL and Battle Plan. By second turn Scum is in full effizzect with Mara at the Chamber and some ORSs at Eisley (deploy 1 apiece of course). I'm slow on my tests for some reason, I keep activating vital cards (Training Area, Test 1) so I gotta draw them instead of getting em from reserve. I am inserting AFA's, and they're popping regularly, so I'm getting in some early trouble, along with Surprise Assaults on his weenie ORSs for some more hurt. Boussh goes to the Chamber to stop Mara and her vibrator from getting off for two a turn, and eventually I get Test 1 over with. That combined with a couple Projections and Battle Plan means he ain't draining for much.<br />
I look around, and he's not playing with CHYBC or Secret Plans. This means I can set EG-4 up at the CC Carbo Chamber and start Off Edging out the wazoo. So basically he's not hurting me at all (in fact, I'm tracking Off Edge destinies and actually gaining force back gradually), and I'm finishing off the tests and throwing AFA's at him.<br />
I get Test 5 done (after he tries to Bubo me - no can do, sez Yoda), draw a tracked 5, retrieve my whole damn lost pile, and search for a Surprise Assault to finish him with. 'Hrmm ... you're draining me with two ORSs and Chall? Surprise Assault, I draw 3 7's to your ... 6?' Full win by 30<br />
2 (+30)<br />
<br />
The good: Playing somebody I didn't know and totally shutting him down. Getting lucky and going against someone who didn't play CHYBC or Secret Plans.<br />
<br />
The bad: Nice try with that Bubo - I never leave Luke alone.<br />
<br />
The hilarious: While Mike and I were still playing, the game next to us finished. It was local, 1700+ rated player, and friend of mine Joe Janiak's DS space numbers against Matt Sokol's something or other. Guess who won? Way to go Janiak.<br />
<br />
Round 1, Game 2.<br />
My weak Hunt Down vs. Adam's Endor scout junk.<br />
I had played against this exact deck a week ago, so I was ready for it. He starts Chirpa's, CPlanning for the Landing Site, I start the Hunt Down crap w/Epic and Crush (this is my start for every game, unless otherwise stated).<br />
My lovely white-bordered Visage was on table all game, as Adam had nothing against it (aww). Anyway I get the Dark Lord's Image to the Holotable pretty fast (3rd turn?) and drain happily there for the rest of the game. I also get the Man himself to the RLS pretty fast, and he clears off with Crix Madine and CoK (damn EPPs, no immunity). It don't matter, though, Vader comes back to stay a couple turns later.<br />
Meanwhile Adam is doing not much. He sets up with some weak-ass ships at Coruscant (GLiG1 piloted by ANH Chewie - oooh) and Kessel (RLiR1 all by himself!!!). Unfortunately I can't find any of my ships (ok, so I only have two in the deck) so he gets away with a gay drain of 6 and increased deploy for my peeps.<br />
It aint no thing, though, I drop Battle Order and he aint activatin much (just the two systems, Endor sites, and my Holotable), and Visage is eating away at him (I don't have to pay for that!) I drop Mara with her toy at Chirpa's joint for a schweet drain of 3. He's tossing mad Obis and Lukes so I know he aint got the jones to test the Big Guy. He does try to be a wise guy and set up with EPP Leia, Gen Solo, and some 2/2 chump at a generic Farm on Endor, thinking it'll let him drain for free (Battle Order). I say - no way Jose! The Farm aint a battleground with Leia there and Hunt Down flipped (remember, Vader's at the Landing Site). He gets @#$%y and calls the TD, I have to whip out the rules, the card, and plead my case.<br />
I of course am right, and he's running low on force, so he only drains me once that turn. By next turn I have drained/Visaged him to where he can't pay to drain at all. That's game. Full win by 10<br />
4 (+40)<br />
<br />
The good: Vader scarin the schnikeys outta his little people. White-bordered Visage =) Beating Adam because Team UR has a vendetta against him.<br />
<br />
The bad: Friggin Coruscant and Kessel, and me not bein able to find Fett or Zuckuss &gt;=0<br />
<br />
The ugly: Him callin a judge on that rule, it says plain as day on Hunt Down that you can't initiate battles where you got a Skywalker, and that means it aint a battleground. Eh well.<br />
<br />
Onward and upward ..<br />
Round 2, game 2.<br />
My EPP Yoda vs. Dan Sokol's generic Hunt Down.<br />
So finally I'm paired against a high-ranked player - this was actually my first game ever in a tourney against a 1900+ player. It started off pretty rough, with him having 61 cards in his deck (I had been counting cards each game since we didn't do decklists). I decide to be a hardnose and try and get a free win off him, but Brett the back-up judge says no, he can just toss a card out of his deck (Bubo - big deal). Rich the SM is nowhere to be found and Brett wants to penalize me for stalling, so I say screw it, let's rumble.<br />
He starts CHYBC (after talking w/his dog about my deck, no doubt) and no Epic. I start Goo to keep Vader away first turn.<br />
His deck was really generic and I should've beaten it. He starts getting out battleground sites like 3rd Marker, Forest Clearing, the usual stuff. Vader goes to Hoth, and a walker with a bunch of chumps to Endor.<br />
I'm taking forever to complete Test 1 because I'm not being smart and tracking cards, and I draw the same Obi-Wan and Dagobah Swamp twice in a row (sonuva!). I do get Boussh to Hoth so Vader is just playing with his lightsaber, and a Projection on the Clearing so I'm not losing too much. I insert AFA's here and there, but he has Resistance out so he's only losing two to my one card. Speakin of that, I Stone Pile him once or twice too. Other than that, neither one of us is causing much damage.<br />
Finally I get smart and track that Obi and Swamp to be in my deck when I draw, and actually finish the first test. From there on it's pretty smooth sailing. The only force I'm really losing is to Visage because I can't find my sonuva@#$%in Terminateds. Finally I draw one and play it like a moron during the same draw phase. Of course he just re-deploys Visage next turn. A couple turns of force loss later I get another Terminated, and save it for his turn this time. Doesn't matter tho, that's his last one. He does Sniper Boussh so he can drain for one there.<br />
And by this time he has set up with some crappy ships at Kashyyyk (Avenger, Zuckit, Evax, blah blah) and is draining me free there and at Hoth. I'm trying to find my friggin Traffic Control, or at least a Signal, cuz both of my 7's are in my hand, but I don't get it in time. Here's what happens with Test 5:<br />
He lands Zuckit in Hunter with Evax two sites away from Yoda. Big deal, I think, he doesn't even have anybody with him who has enough ability to battle Yoda. I set Luke upside down, then draw a couple and finally get my Traffic Control. He drains me on Dagobah and at Kashyyyk. I go, and prepare to complete the test. I have to occupy two bgs if I wanna retrieve with the test. So I deploy CC: Carbo Chamber with Jeroen there. I know he's gonna get jacked, but I figger ten retrieval is worth it. I have Obi and his saber in hand, and I have to choose to deploy them either (1) to Hoth, with lone Vader, or (2) to Endor, with a walker and like 3 or 4 2/2 guys. I choose to deploy him to Hoth, and soon as I do, Dan plays a non-Epic Circle. Damned! There goes my retrieval. I have no other way of occupying any bgs, so I just finish the damn test and draw a 5 (Signal) since my 7's were friggin stuck in my hand.<br />
Anyway, he gives up on Dagobah, flying Zuckuss away and setting up at Endor. Then he jumps poor Jeroen, all by himself, with Mara and her saber. Luckily for me his destinies suck, and I get away with losing Webb and like three. Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out how I can occupy two bgs so I can On The Edge.<br />
I have to pick Luke up (meanwhile he's draining on Hoth, Cloud City, Kashyyyk, and Endor), then I drop him to pay a visit to his chick on Cloud City, Lando in Falcon to Endor (where's a friggin Claw when I need it?), On The Edge Luke for four, then smack Mara outta there (the Tests and Yoda at his hut keep Luke alive). This doesn't hold him off for long though, he battles Lando, who goes down in flames, and I again cannot fulfill CHYBC. I drain at Cloud City once or twice more but am being grossly outdrained. Full loss by 9<br />
4 (+31)<br />
<br />
The good: Not much. I screwed up so many times this game it wasn't funny.<br />
<br />
The bad: Taking too long with the tests, deploying Obi to get raped by Vader, not having a Claw for the Falcon, getting my 7's stuck in hand, etc.<br />
<br />
The ugly: I made a big deal about him having 61 cards in his deck, he wasn't too happy about that. But I figger, c'mon, how hard is it to count to 60?<br />
<br />
Lunch break, and I am not hungry in the least. I go for a stroll w/my homey Nick, he picks up some nasty greasy food at the Pit. I stop back at my dorm room for a little rest and to check my messages. Enough stupid stuff, onto ...<br />
<br />
Round 2, game 2.<br />
My crappy DS vs. Jake's Profit.<br />
Well Profit is the one deck where I switch my starting effect. I go with Mara, solo, at the Chamber, and Twilek for Imperial Domination on the Chamber. He Signals for Goo Nee Tay.<br />
This game was actually a breeze. He was activating 3 a turn for the first 3 turns, till he finally drew some sites. I left Mara to guard the Chamber and put Vader at the Palace. His Image went to drain at the Table.<br />
Finally by about the 7th or 8th turn he drops EPP Leia and some chumps to the Chamber, Leia expresses her Love for WB Premiere Han, he comes out and Jake retreives ten. EPP Han replaces his disco-collared self, and Jake has him, Leia, Tawss, and SE Wedge against my Mara. EPP Luke drops for 3 to Mos Eisley (away from Vader and Mara) so Jake can initiate at the Chamber.<br />
So he's thinkin he's gonna smack me around pretty bad, him having 4 characters to my one. Wellllll...his only actions are to shoot at Mara with each gun, and he misses both times. My actions are as follows:<br />
(1) Set for Stun Tawss. She goes back to hand as I draw a Masterful Move.<br />
(2) You Are Beaten Leia. It's starting to look bad for Jake.<br />
(3) Vader's Eye on Mara, add a battle destiny.<br />
(4) Pimp-slap Han with a lightsaber.<br />
(5) draw two battle destiny - 6 and 4. He draws a 1, loses Han (flip back), Wedge, and one.<br />
I'm just goin buck-wild now &gt;=) Next turn Vader gets picked up, and Mara goes out to the Palace for a drain of 3. He's not draining at all thanks to his objective (which doesn't flip again for the rest of the game). Next turn Vader drops down on his boy and converts him to the dark side. Obi makes an appearance and is promptly Circled away. The damage from the duels and Mara's drain at the Palace finish him quickly. Full win by upper-teens?<br />
6 (+50-somethin?)<br />
<br />
The good: Mara smackin the schnikeys outta Han, Leia, Tawss, and Wedge. Vader jackin Luke and Obi.<br />
<br />
The bad: He tried to drain me on Tatooine once, with his objective on the zero side. I almost fell for it too!<br />
<br />
The ugly: Him activating three a turn for the first three turns. Ouch.<br />
<br />
So at this point I'm thinkin I still have a shot at the tourney. The two Sokols get paired against each other and decide to just drop. I get paired against ...<br />
<br />
Jason 'Ears' Stewart's stoopid Yavin Occupation vs. EPP Yoda<br />
Round 3, game 1.<br />
Well - I SCHOOLED him. He started Occupation, Yavin, and Forest, Twileked for something meaningless (mighta been Resistance).<br />
Anyway, I got my Tests goin pretty fast, while he set up some sites with walkers (Sandwhirl on the Desert too - very nice). Anyway, I Projection two sites and Boussh another. He finally gets Occupation going, but I had been drawing madly looking for my Endor Celeb, and I take RBO out on my turn.<br />
He goes and sets up a drain at Kashyyyk so he doesn't have to pay for Battle Plan, and re-deploys RBO. Of course I was tracking my Celebration though, so I only lose to RBO one turn before I draw it again. The second RBO is his last, and I don't have to worry about it again after I cancel it.<br />
He PotF's two Yavin sites so he can drain one at each, and tries to Trample Boussh - TWICE. No dice either time, so he's draining me one each at two sites, Kashyyyk, and the friggin Holotable which he also set up w/Image.<br />
So once again I find myself playing against someone without CHYBC or Secret Plans in their deck. This means EG-4 goes to the Carbo Chamber and I'm retrieving 7 a turn with tracked destiny =) That gets me through to Test 5, where I draw another nice tracked 7 and retrieve a whole bunch.<br />
After that, it's all good, I search w/Test 4 for a Surprise Assault, On The Edge, or whatever I might need. He eventually draws up to keep me from retrieving everything &gt;=) Full win by lower-mid teens?<br />
8 (+upper-60s)<br />
<br />
The good: Beating Stewart soundly after we had argued before the tourney about who was better. I am now 2-1 in tourney play against him (3-2 overall).<br />
<br />
The bad: PotF's on generic sites. The constant drains hurt me quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Stewart's ears, of course.<br />
<br />
So I'm in second, with Brian Terwillinger ahead of me. He and I get paired, and if I can pull a 24+ win outta my ear, I take the tourney. Otherwise, I'll be in second or below.<br />
<br />
Round 3, game 3.<br />
My crappy DS Hunting vs. Twiggy's Throne Room numbers w/mains backup.<br />
He starts the Throne Room junk, I get my usual.<br />
The first few turns are just us drawing and losing to Visage (he gets the Nudjes out of course). I get the Holotable out with Image there hoping to drain for one, but he sends a Projection to clear the site. About 5th turn he Terminates Visage, which just slows the game even more cuz now there's no pressure on either of us.<br />
Then he drops R2-D2 to the Theater, 8D8 to the Throne Room, and gives me a friggin Odds. I have a Torture in hand, but refrain from busting it right away.<br />
We chill for a couple more boring turns, just drawing and me searching reserve every turn for an Evader or I Have You (which I promptly put back with Terminal) so I can reshuffle. He's Visored Visioning me quite frequently, and always in pairs, so he must've been playing at least 4. That's about all the damage that is done until I deploy Mara to the Throne Room and Vader with a PotF on the Farm, flipping and redeploying Visage (I MMoved for a Holonet Transmission to protect it). He comes down with some chumps including Luke and we skirmish, I don't have the good cards I did before in game 4 so Mara goes down (I was hoping to duel Luke with her).<br />
So I decide to make a ballsy move and duel Luke with Vader. I Dark Path for a 6, which he Blows, then get a nice fat 1 under that (another Vader). I seriously have like 25+ destiny 6 cards in my deck, and I draw a friggin 1. Anyway Vader goes down and I give up. Full loss by 26 (I remember this one)<br />
8 (lower-40s)<br />
<br />
The good: Playing the number 3-ranked player in the world.<br />
<br />
The bad: Losing to the number 3-ranked player in the world.<br />
<br />
The ugly: I played horribly anyway. I never shoulda deployed first, that was just stupid. But oh well. I *did* Torture every Odds card that ever made it to the top of my deck. &gt;=)<br />
<br />
So I end up in 4th, Twiggy takes first, his bro was prolly in 2nd, 1800+ Charles Clarkson was in 3rd (only cuz I didnt play him, he woulda lost). It's a shame I couldn't have beaten Twiggy, that woulda given me the tourney and a HUGE rating boost. But win some lose some. It's also a shame I couldn't get to PA states. Maybe I'll make it to the NY ones instead (as a college student, I can do that kinda thing ;-)<br />
Prize support for this tourney was lame, I think Terwillinger got like 3 WB Premiere packs, 3 WB ANH packs, and 3 SE packs - pretty sad for having driven cross-state. I got one PHAT pack of Special Edition, pulling a Wedge (which I tried in vain to put in my YJ deck afterwards) But whatever. Hopefully next year's SimCon will be bigger and better than ever.<br />
I did stay after for the YJ tournament and won that easily (even without Wedge), my only loss coming from Nick, who I taught how to play 5 mins before the tourney and who used my spare decks. Boy does that game suck. =P<br />
If you want my decklists or any other info, message me, but keep in mind my dark deck is CRAP.<br />
