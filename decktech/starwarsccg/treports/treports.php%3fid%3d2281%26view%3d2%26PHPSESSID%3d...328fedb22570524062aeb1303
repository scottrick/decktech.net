to see who&#146;s #1.  The championship was run at A-1 Comics in Roseville,<br />
not far from Sacramento.  Mike Hardy was to be the TD.<br />
<br />
So I hook up with Nick Stefanko and his station wagon in Pleasanton &amp;<br />
make the trip to Roseville with his brother, Alfred Dong (who I <br />
predicted would win the championship), Steve Daniel, and Andrew Meewis.<br />
It was by far the most uncomfortable trip of my life, sitting in back <br />
on a ROCK HARD seat, and virtually no room at all for my legs.  It was<br />
absolutely unbearable, and I would not sit in that station wagon ever<br />
again.<br />
<br />
I&#146;m still in final exam mode, but had managed to find time to modify my<br />
decks somewhat.  I had been using EBOX and Hunt Down w/unique TIEs, but<br />
changed them.  My LS was still EBO, but using Mon Cal Cruisers instead,<br />
and more EPP mains to fight on land more effectively.  My DS was still<br />
Hunt Down, but I ditched the space power and went for ground beats.  I<br />
used several bounty hunters, All Wrapped Up, and Bounties for retrieval.<br />
I also had been seeing a trend of a lot of EBO decks lately, which would<br />
rip up my deck, so I added in an ATAT cannon and TTMG.  I was expecting<br />
on playing against AT LEAST 2 EBO decks.  Unfortunately, I had no time <br />
to playtest them, so the decks were all theory and would be new for me,<br />
but oh well, I&#146;ll have to manage.<br />
<br />
So we all get to the venue, but Hardy&#146;s not there yet so we sit around<br />
for a while, and I see some big name players arrive. Paul Feldman, Eric<br />
&quot;Big E&quot; Bruen, Jeff Miller, Tray Frazier, Pete Nordstrom, Jason Makohon,<br />
&amp; the &quot;Lodi crew&quot; all arrive.  But as I said, a lot of Southern CA talent<br />
 was missing.  I was betting on Bruen, Dong, or Feldman to win the title.<br />
So we fill out decklists (those of us who hadn&#146;t already done so), pay <br />
the $10 entry fee, and get ready to play.  Over 60 people are playing <br />
(65 I think it was).<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS v Steve Daniel&#146;s Y4 Throne Room jank (Insurr, DODN/WA, ????)<br />
<br />
I&#146;m confused when I don&#146;t see Staging Areas as a starting effect.  So I<br />
have no idea what to expect, plus this is the first time playing my new<br />
deck, so its double trouble for me.  He pulls 1/0 DBs, but no twix sites<br />
yet.  I pull Exec DB, then Tat DB and put DLOTS there on my 2nd turn.<br />
He cancels Visage w/TT combo, then EPP Obi comes to battle DLOTS, they <br />
both die.  Then he plays OOC, but doesn&#146;t get Vader.  I drop another <br />
Vader and Jodo, then EPP Luke comes to battle, and kills Vader, but Jodo<br />
captures Luke.  Thats because I started All Wrapped Up (along with IAO &amp;<br />
Mob Pts).  He OOCs a couple more times, but still misses Vader.  Turns <br />
out he&#146;s playing 9 OOCs!  Yikes!  Steve deploys 8D8 to Y4 War room, my<br />
next turn I Twi&#146;lek for YCHF to prevent odds.  Then he deploys Artoo w/<br />
8D8 and plays HDWGITM to draw a new hand (he does it several times <br />
during the game).  He REALLY wants to get Vader OOP.  I deploy CHYBC to<br />
stop any retrieval he might have in his deck (turns out he uses Edge<br />
cards), and he deploys Battle Plan.<br />
<br />
Now I&#146;m paying 6 to drain for 2 at my CC and Tat Dbays (no BG systems in<br />
my deck, I use Mob Pts to pull Executor).  Search and Destroy comes out,<br />
he he inserts AFA 3 times on me, but only once it hits because 2 other<br />
times he had EPP Obi on table to battle.  Obi frees Luke by killing<br />
Jodo, but I put a Bounty on Luke&#146;s head and recap him.  By now Steve <br />
realizes he can&#146;t hurt me or retrieve force, so he hits me with a late<br />
game Surprise Assault for 2 force and eventually does get Vader OOP. <br />
In fact, he put 20 cards of mine OOP, I had no lost pile.  But I still<br />
win by 15.  2 (+15).  I find out he plays 3 EPP Obis and 3 EPP Lukes.<br />
So when I capped Luke that really hurt him.<br />
<br />
Best: Coward &amp; YCHF earned their card slots in that game.<br />
Worst: Paying 6 to drain for 2.  Yikes!<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS v John Monroe&#146;s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, SSPFT)<br />
<br />
We&#146;ve played this matchup several times before, and I&#146;ve never lost to<br />
John&#146;s ISB deck, but I didn&#146;t know how Mon Cals would fare.  I started<br />
ANSB and luckily drew Battle Plan in my opening hand.  So as I was <br />
setting up EBO he pulled Exec (w/Mob Pts), Exec DB, and Piett w/Command.<br />
He got Merrejk and eventually put them at Exec DB, while pulling all<br />
his systems out.  I draw into Staging Areas and Haven, great for me.<br />
He pays 3 to drain for 2 at Endor while I setup Haven on Hoth &amp; deploy<br />
Defiance w/Hassh&#146;n aboard.  I use EBG to pull my Rogue pilots and get<br />
Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge, establishing Menace<br />
Fades.  He avoids Hoth and sets up at Fondor, Kashyyyk, and Endor.  He<br />
uses Den of Thieves and an ORS to kill my Hoth drain &amp; I&#146;m looking<br />
for a Signal to pull Strikeforce (so he can&#146;t cancel my space drain).<br />
I drop 3 more cruisers to Hoth (-1 staging areas, -1 EBO, -2 Haven, so<br />
they deploy for 4 force!), and move a couple cruisers w/pilots to<br />
Endor.  His other drains are only 1 each thanks to Menace.  He just <br />
runs most of his fleet to Hoth, taking advantage of the fact that his<br />
other ships are safe since my cruisers only deploy to Hoth.<br />
<br />
I battle at Hoth, he loses a couple ORS (he has flipped by now), and<br />
I move from Endor to Hoth.  He never deploys to the ground to satisfy<br />
Battle Plan, but he does manage to block Menace Fades for a turn so he<br />
pays to drain me for 3 at Kashyyyk (Chirneau adding to the drain).<br />
I&#146;m ready to do some Edge retrieval, when the TD says we have 1 minute<br />
left.  Jeez, we&#146;ve each still got over 20 cards left, so I know we <br />
won&#146;t finish.  Time is called, and he&#146;s got 29 cards to my 24.  *sigh*<br />
Timed Loss by 29.  2 (-14).<br />
<br />
Best: The deck seemed to work well.<br />
Worst: John is a slow player, plus I think I was playing slower than <br />
normal since I was playing the deck for the 1st time. Fun game though.<br />
<br />
Game 3: DS v Norman Perion&#146;s EBO (ANSB)<br />
<br />
Ah-hah!  Didn&#146;t I say I&#146;d play vs. EBO?  Well, my opening hand stinks.<br />
No Vader, ATAT, Cannon, or TTMG.  But when I pull the Exec DB, I see<br />
I activated the Cannon and Blizzard 1.  So I draw those up.  Just <br />
need TTMG and a high ability pilot (like Vader or Mara).  He sets up<br />
EBO turn 3, with some Baragwins.  They&#146;re retrieving everything he&#146;s<br />
losing to Visage, so I Twi&#146;lek for CHYBC to stop that gay retrieval.<br />
By now I have Mighty Jabba at CC DB, Xizor at Tat DB, and Lando at<br />
Exec DB (after I deploy Lando, he loses General Lando to Visage, lol).<br />
So I leave them there and deploy Blizzard 1 with Vader and the Cannon.<br />
He gives me look of amazment like he doesn&#146;t believe what he sees.  <br />
He drops Sullust w/Haven and Gold 6 w/pilot there.  I&#146;m hoping I draw<br />
high enough to kill EBO so I don&#146;t have to eat that drain.  On my turn<br />
I play TTMG, and he just groans, I say I need to draw a 2, and I draw<br />
a 2, so the MPGs are gone, ANSB is gone, and most importantly, EBO is<br />
gone, along with 8 of his life force.  Too bad I didn&#146;t have Mara,<br />
cuz she could&#146;ve beat down a Baragwin badly.<br />
<br />
Later during that turn I deploy the Executor to Sullust and move Lando<br />
aboard.  I also deploy Search and Destroy.  So he&#146;s losing to S&amp;D,<br />
Visage, and my drains.  And he can&#146;t retrieve.  As the game goes on I<br />
transit my guys over to Hoth, to kill the Baragwins.  I battled at <br />
Sullust and drew a 6, so Gold 6 and pilot died, along with Haven.  So<br />
Lando ruled space in the Executor.  Win by 32.  4 (+18).<br />
<br />
Best: CHYBC and TTMG earned their card slots.  I would&#146;ve died<br />
horribly to this deck without those cards.  The Baragwins are<br />
retrieval machines!<br />
Worst: No Mara to infiltrate Hoth with.  I had to transit guys over.<br />
<br />
Game 4: LS v Steve Daniel&#146;s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, ????)<br />
<br />
I think he also started Crush, but I could be wrong.  Anyways, he<br />
gets Emp and Janus to Endor DB, DLOTS to CC DB.  I start ANSB and<br />
deploy destiny 6 Luke to DLOTS.  I get Battle Plan out early to make<br />
him pay to drain, but can&#146;t find Haven.  So I setup EBO and drop 2<br />
cruisers to Hoth.  Hobbie and Zev in Rogue 4 go to the North Ridge.<br />
His turn he beats the hell out of Zev and Hobbie.  Tempest 1, <br />
Blizzard 2, and Fett hit the Ridge, and I lose Zev and Hobbie and<br />
stack a card.  Hobbie goes to the Bacta Tank.  So I pay for my space<br />
drain, and decide to let him have the Ridge.  I move to Chandrila to<br />
activate more force, leaving Hoth empty.  He drops Chimarea w/Ozzel<br />
&amp; another pilot to Chandrila, I move back to Hoth, he follows.  Now<br />
I&#146;ve got Haven, so I drop 2 cruisers, Lando in Falcon, &amp; RL in R1 <br />
to beat the hell out of the Chimaera (power was 50 to 19), but he <br />
just Ghhhks.  I drew a 6 and 5 for battle destiny.  Then I split my<br />
fleet between Chandrila and Hoth.  He drops Zuckuss w/4LOM to<br />
Chandrila, but I barrier Zuckuss.  I deploy I&#146;ll Take the Leader to<br />
make him power 2, then battle to kill Zuckuss plus 6 overflow damage.<br />
I had Ackbar and Hassh&#146;n there, but I forgot to use Ackbar&#146;s text at<br />
the start of my turn to pull Thaneespi.  That could&#146;ve been a nice<br />
beating on Zuckuss (power 2 and NO destiny!).<br />
<br />
Now I own space, and he spreads on the ground so I deploy Wedge, RSL<br />
on Rogue 4 and shuttle Hobbie there to hold the Ridge.  He deploys<br />
another Chimaera w/a couple pilots later, but steers clear of my <br />
fleet so he can drain for free (he has Carida out).  But my drains<br />
are much bigger, and I eventually kill the Chimaera again (not in<br />
a beating though), and drain him out for the win.  Win by 8.  <br />
6 (+26).<br />
<br />
Best: Deck seemed to work well yet again.  Only 1 card got stacked.<br />
Worst: I deployed a LOT in this game.  Plus Vader and Emp were<br />
draining me all game.  Where were my EPPs?<br />
<br />
Game 5: LS v Tray Frazier&#146;s TDIGWATT (IAO, Mob Pts, Crush)<br />
<br />
I start ANSB and as I was doing that, he got Emp, Janus, and Mara<br />
w/saber all at the CC Db with a POTF there.  Drain of 4!  Ouch.<br />
Times like this I wish I was playing EBOX so I just use an xwing to<br />
cancel it.  Oh well, I eat that drain and get Haven on Hoth and put<br />
GL in G1 and a cruiser there along with Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 1<br />
at the Ridge.  Menace Fades is out, so he&#146;s draining me for 2 now.<br />
HE comes at me with Dengar w/gun and Lord Vader to the Ridge, I<br />
barrier Vader.  On my turn, I Ice Storm and he&#146;s really pissed when<br />
I do that.  So Menace Fades is back, and I&#146;m draining for 4 at Hoth <br />
now since Launching the Assault is out.  He drops Chimaera w/Guri<br />
and Thrawn and battles, sending Ackbar to the Tank.  He has his<br />
Order out whoch makes his ships immune to attirion&lt;8, so I need to<br />
get a new Order out.  I deploy Lando in Falcon and Home One to Hoth<br />
and kill Guri and Thrawn, he runs to Chandrila and puts 2 more <br />
pilots on it.  I move Home One over with Luke and Wedge, RSL aboard.<br />
He stays there, so on my turn I deploy Liberty and EPP Han there &amp;<br />
smash the Chimaera (drawing 2 high destiny and cancelling his draw)<br />
and now I own space.  The big space drains shortly end the game.<br />
He only deployed Bespin, CC DB, CC West Corridor, &amp; a 1/0 Dbay.<br />
Win by 10.  8 (+36).<br />
<br />
Best: I&#146;m liking this light deck.<br />
Worst: The deck for some reason just can&#146;t win by very high <br />
differential.  I&#146;m 4-1 but with really low diff, even compared to<br />
the people who are 3-2.<br />
<br />
Game 6: DS v John Monroe&#146;s HB mains (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br />
<br />
I&#146;m thinking its an auto-win here.  John has played this deck since <br />
the dawn of time, and it seems he always will play it.  I figure<br />
I&#146;ll capture his guys, and retrieve w/Bounties.  It started off <br />
well when he put Ben Kenobi w/stick to Tat DB.  I put a Bounty on<br />
him and deployed Bossk w/gun and Dr. E/Ponda and battled.  DLOTS <br />
was at the CC DB.  I capped Ben w/Bossk, so he took him over to<br />
DLOTS.  He&#146;s activating 10 force, and drops Jedi Luke w/saber,<br />
battles, steals Vader&#146;s stick, hits Bossk (barely), plays SATM/BP<br />
to make him lost, then hits Vader w/Ben.  I draw a 5, so Ben <br />
revives Luke.  But now Ben and Luke are at my CC DB, and I couldn&#146;t<br />
believe how badly that went.  Anyway, EPP Vader went to Tat DB,<br />
I deployed CC Prison, deployed Lando aboard Tempest 1, and moved to<br />
Vader&#146;s site.  Then I deployed Sim and Emperor to Vader&#146;s site.<br />
He put Wedge, RSL and Mirax with Ben and Luke.  I moved everyone<br />
(except the Emperor) to Ben and Luke&#146;s site, adn he moved away. <br />
<br />
That continued until we heard &quot;5 minutes left.&quot;  Like I said, John<br />
is a rather slow player, but its partly my fault cuz I was talking<br />
to him about stuff, which just slows everything down even more.  I<br />
was mad at myself (I didn&#146;t want a timed win), so when I moved my<br />
guys over to his guys, I used Sim to check his destiny, and he had<br />
a zero on top.  I knew I had a 5 and 4 on top, so I decided to duel,<br />
but who would I duel first?  Both had sabers, so I picked Luke (he<br />
is harder to duel).  I had more life force than John, so I could&#146;ve<br />
let things progress, but I didn&#146;t want a timed win.  He draws a 0<br />
and 3, but plays Glancing Blow, so he wins the duel.  I&#146;m in shock,<br />
(like Norman was when I played TTMG), and I lose my 9 force.  Oh<br />
well, I had to risk it.  A timed win would&#146;ve been just as good as<br />
a loss for me.  When time is called, he has 27 to my 19.  Timed<br />
loss by 27.  8 (+9).<br />
<br />
Best: None really, I needed to battle him so I could duel and use<br />
Tarkin to cancel on of his destiny.  But he wouldn&#146;t stick around<br />
to battle.  I thought about picking up Vader, but I never had <br />
enough guys to back up Vader with.<br />
Worst: Really boring game, it really was just those 2 battles at<br />
the start of the game, then just avoidance.  I guess that&#146;s why I<br />
started talking to him, cuz I was bored.<br />
<br />
John decides to drop at this point since he&#146;s got 3 timed wins and<br />
one loss.<br />
<br />
Game 7: DS v Pete Nordstrom&#146;s Profit (Insurr, Staging, Wise Advice)<br />
<br />
I start Mara and EPP Fett.  I deploy Exec DB, JP Dungeon, Tat DB, <br />
&amp; DLOTS to the Tat DB all 1st turn.  He draws.  When Vader drains,<br />
he plays Lost in Wilderness, but draws a 1, so Vader&#146;s safe.  He<br />
deploys his CC DB, and deploys BoShuda.  I deploy my CC DB, I <br />
deploy Lando and Tempest 1 there, so Lando w/Ax is not a worry <br />
anymore.  I also deploy Mara&#146;s saber and CHYBC.  I move Fett &amp;<br />
Mara outside to JP.  He deploys EPP Obi to Vader and they kill<br />
each other.  I deploy EPP Vader and Tarkin, then deploy Search &amp;<br />
Destroy.  I know he wants to free Han but doesn&#146;t know how he&#146;s<br />
going to occupy 2 BG sites.  I keep deploying every turn, and I&#146;ve<br />
got Emp at Tat DB, Jabba, Fett, Mara, and 4LOM at JP, Vader and<br />
Tarkin at my CC DB, and Dr. E/Ponda and Lando in Tempest 1 at his<br />
CC DB.  Where would you deploy?  He puts Ben at Tat DB, and <br />
battles the Emp.  I draw low so I lose 2 force.<br />
<br />
I move Vader and Tarkin over, but he runs to CC DB (which is now<br />
empty since Vader and Tarkin moved to Tat DB).  Vader &amp; Tarkin<br />
follow Ben, so he deploys Orrimaarko to battle the Emp with a <br />
tracked 6, I draw low so I lose Emp and 2 force to Orri&#146;s text.<br />
Ben moves over to Orri&#146;s site.  I move Vader and Tarkin over.<br />
He deploys Mirax in the Chamber and I realize he&#146;s going to transit<br />
Ben to CC DB to occupy 2 BG sites, then free Han, so I blindly<br />
duel Ben, drawing two 5&#146;s to his two 1&#146;s, and he just scoops up<br />
his deck right then and there, so I win by 23.  10 (+32).<br />
<br />
Best: Don&#146;t try those blind duels at home, they&#146;re dangerous.  :P<br />
Worst: Both Pete and I had planned on doing better than we were<br />
doing, so I can understand him being a little pissed.<br />
<br />
Game 8: LS v Jeff Miller&#146;s Endor Ops TIEs (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br />
<br />
He pulls Wakeelmui and every 1/0 Dbay there is.  I start ANSB.<br />
He draws for a while, I deploy Battle Plan and get EBO by turn 2.<br />
I put Liberty and Zev at Hoth, he drops 2 Interceptors and 2 <br />
Dreadnoughts (I barrier 1 of them), battles and of course plays<br />
APTW.  I lose Zev to the Tank and Liberty to the used pile since<br />
he outpowered me by a good amount.  Oh yeah, he had SFS out too.<br />
So I deploy GL in G1 w/Zen aboard and move them over to Wakeelmui.<br />
Hobbie and Wedge are in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge.  He deploys<br />
Janus to Endor DB to satisfy Battle Plan, and deploys 2 more<br />
Interceptors and a Dread to his Sullust.  I&#146;ve got Haven in hand<br />
so I can go to either system, but I fear his text on Sullust (I<br />
lose 8 force if he cancels Haven).  I decide to hold off on Haven<br />
and put RL in R1 at Chandrila.  That also satisfies Menace Fades<br />
for me so he&#146;s not draining for as much.  He drops an interceptor<br />
w/cannons and blows up Red Leader.  Now I drop destiny 6 Luke to<br />
Janus, he barriers, then runs Janus to the Bunker.<br />
<br />
I decide to deploy a Cruiser to Hoth, then put down Haven and<br />
deploy Lando in Falcon &amp; another cruiser.  He deploys an <br />
interceptor to Wakeelmui and deploys Emp&#146;s Sword to Hoth, battles,<br />
and plays APTW so I lose a cruiser, and since I draw low on both<br />
draws he just loses a TIE.  He moves his fleet to Wakeelmui (he<br />
had been moving it from Sullust to get it closer to Wakeelmui)<br />
so Gold Leader and Zev run away.  Then we hear &quot;only 2 minutes <br />
left,&quot; and I&#146;m wondering where the time is going.  Jeff is playing<br />
slowly, but I didn&#146;t think an HOUR had passed already.  Anyway,<br />
I do 2 On The edges but he still has 24 force to my 20 force when<br />
time is called.  I honestly don&#146;t know where the time went.  Does<br />
it sound like all that happened in an hour?  Well, it did.  Timed<br />
loss by 24.  10 (+8).<br />
<br />
Best: I owned all the BG sites.<br />
Worst: He owned most of the BG systems.  TIEs are just too fast<br />
for my deck I think.  An why is my LS timing out?  I&#146;m not a slow <br />
player at all.<br />
<br />
So I finish 17th place with a score of 10 (+8).  What terrible<br />
differential, huh?  Here are the top 6:<br />
<br />
Alfred Dong 14 (+111)<br />
Paul Feldman 14 (+100)<br />
Paul McKelvey 12 (+120)<br />
Jason Makohon 12 (+104)<br />
Alexander Sheynis<br />
Kyle Ishimaru<br />
<br />
Alfred and Paul played in the final, with Paul winning both games,<br />
thus earning the title of State Champion.  Alfred used his Hunt <br />
Down v Paul&#146;s WYS, with Paul winning by 2 or 3 force, then Alfred<br />
played his Y4 Throne Room deck v Paul&#146;s SYCFA manipulator deck, <br />
where Paul won again (they didn&#146;t count the diff).  Congrats to<br />
Paul, and thanks to all of you for reading.  Back to studying for<br />
finals.<br />
<br />
Props to:<br />
Alfred for getting to that final.<br />
Paul for winning the final.<br />
Paul Mckelvey for doing waaaay better than I thought he would.<br />
Kyle for doing waaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought he would.<br />
Phil Green for doing waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought.<br />
Steve Daniel for actually winning with that light deck.<br />
Nick for the ride.<br />
Mike Hardy for running the tourney.<br />
<br />
Slops to:<br />
Nick&#146;s station wagon, that wagon sucks.<br />
Alfred for losing to Paul&#146;s WYS deck.  Somehow he let Paul back in<br />
that game cuz it looked like Alfred had it locked.<br />
Mike Hardy for being late. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=2281&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
