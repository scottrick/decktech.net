It was literally like someone didnt want me to be at Origins in 2005. So sit back and enjoy the ride of a lifetime as I break down what happened. <br />
<br />
To start, I want to add that this year; the team in Nashville, TN had planned to go to Origins back in January. Seven of us paid the money for the hotel room and made plans on who would be driving. At that time the seven players included Danny Pack, Micah Wooten, Allen Lupinek, Scott Osborne, Tommy Kimsey, Bryan Pedigo, and myself. Month after month, we continued to talk about how excited it was going to be to bring that many players to a big tournament like Origins. Then in April, Allen rolled his car on the way to a tournament. Since then, we have yet to even see the poor boy, which brought use down from seven to six. <br />
<br />
As the summer rolled in, we found ourselves busy with personal activities. Danny bought a house, Micah was busy at his job, Tommy graduated High School, and I had also just bought a house as well as trying to find a way to get through my job starting to suck. All of these things made it hard for us to get any real play testing in. At the beginning of June, I sent in my request for being off the two days of Origins, Thursday and Friday. I had already tried to get the whole week off when I first started back in October, but they denied me. So I wasnt that surprised that they also denied me the time off in June when I requested it. In order to get off, I would just have to use special time for a few hours on Thursday and then take one of my unexcused days for Friday. That was the first problem that would start a continuing downward spiral of events. Because I couldnt use my vacation days for Thursday and Friday, I would have to work the Thursday shift so as not to lose all of that income. I let my team know of my problem, and they responded by Danny agreeing to hang back and not leave until 4:00 pm on Thursday so I could work. The rest of the team would leave that morning at like 7:30 am so they could get something out of the first day of Origins. <br />
<br />
As the weeks past, I noticed that some of my sales had been charged back to me and caused my commission check which I had planned to use for Origins to be HALF of what it normally would be. I got my check on June 23rd, so that didnt give me any time to save up enough money for the trip. The weekend went by, then Monday, then Tuesday, when Wednesday finally reached. I found out at work that if I didnt work the shift on Friday as well as Tuesday. I would not be paid for the 4th of the July. So, by be going to Origins, I would not only have to come up with the money to spend and get me into the Con, but also justify not being paid for Friday and Monday. <br />
<br />
In the worried state that I was on Wednesday night, I decided to call Danny and talk about my options. The team wanted me to go, so they agreed to all loan me $20 for the trip so that I would be able to pay for the Con, the tournaments, and a few meals. So the money problem was fixed. I wanted to go to Origins that bad that I would just have to eat the lost income from work. With all of the money problems worked out, I organized my cards and got them ready to leave the next day.  If I had known what was going to await me the next morning, I would not have slept as well.<br />
<br />
I didnt have to go into work until 11:30, so I usually sleep in until 10:15 or so. At 9:45, my girlfriend woke me up to tell me that her mom who had planned to come into town so that she would not be lonely while I was gone, was not coming. She had decided to change her mind the vary day I was leaving, so that was problem #1. Next, while I was at work, I got a call from my mom telling me that my grandmother had fallen down the stairs and broken her leg so badly that she had to have surgery that vary day. The woman is 79 years old and was going to have a plate and 3 screws placed in her leg the vary day I am suppose to leave town, so that is problem #2. Next, like an hour later, my girlfriend calls me to tell me that she just found out that her cousin had died in a car wreck late Wednesday night. So not only was my girlfriend going to be alone with no mom, but she would be grieving the loss of her cousin as well, so that is problem #3. All in the same morning I was suppose to leave. <br />
<br />
The whole rest of the day, my mom and girlfriend made me feel like I had just burned down the house for still wanting to go to Origins. The main reason was I had already scheduled the time to leave work early, which I couldnt take back; Danny had already missed the opportunity to leave with the rest of the guys; and I also had already paid the money for the hotel. When I finally got off of work, I spent the next hour talking with my girlfriend about how I had an obligation to my friends, and couldnt just leave them to the wolves. Even though it was extremely sad that she has lost her cousin, My mom had decided that I didnt need to be there for my grandmother. So Danny and me finally left for Columbus at 5:10 pm central time. That means, we would be in rush hour traffic going north, the worst possible direction for leaving the city at that time. <br />
<br />
SO finally, I was on my way up to Origins. The first two hours or so, we talked about our decks and what we needed to add to make them stronger, but for some reason, once it became dark. We just stopped talking about swccg, and just talked about random stuff. On the way up, we hit a really bad storm and it almost seemed like we would never get their. It took an hour to get out of Nashville, and then there was construction that took another 30 mins. So with the storm, we didnt reach Columbus til after 1:30 central time, and that was with going and average of 80 to 90 miles an hour. <br />
<br />
YEAH!!!!!, we got to Columbus. So, you would think I could just start the report right, nope there is more. Before we left, we thought we were staying at the Crown Plaza because all we knew about the hotel was it was the one with the cross walk. So we park the car, grab all the bags and boxes of cards, trucked them up to our room #515. Danny began to bang on the door, Hey you guys, let us in, silly heads, Scott!!!, Tommy!!! We then hear a weird voice say, Who is it?? Danny, not knowing who it was decided to call the guys back to find out what the deal was and why they gave us the wrong room number. Well, it turns out it was not the wrong room, but the wrong HOTEL!!!! Then, right as we are finding out this information. The guy whose door we banged on decided to open it and let us know we were at the wrong room. The guy was only wearing boxers and looked as though we had woken him up from a dead sleep. A few apologizes later, and we were on the elevator trucking the cards to the hotel across the street. Man what a day this was. <br />
<br />
Ok, so finally I was at the room with the team and could put my effort into playing swccg. I already knew that I wanted to play Weather Vane (V) start with Combat Readiness (V) for Darkside, and WYS (V) with vehicles for Lightside. My Weather Vane idea used Miiyoom Onith from Premiere, Free Executor starting Mob Points combo / Were the Bait (V), and Maul with immunity at the Chasm for first turn Firepower, a great way to capture Jedi, and great activation for putting characters in their lost pile. I had no idea how popular WYS (V) was or I might have changed the deck to better fight against it. My WYS (V) started Maneuvering Flaps (V) to get Chewie (V) on his AT-ST in order to flip for cheap and be safe all game from weapons or capture. <br />
<br />
In the V card tournament on Friday, I decided to play my WYS (V) as a way to test the strategy before the Nationals tournament, and save my dark deck by playing a new idea I had with Star Destroyers. I had to play Danny both sides in this tournament, losing to his WYS (V) which was almost the exact same as my WYS (V). My WYS (V) went 3-0 in that tournament. I was 1st going into the last game, but took 4th losing by 29 to a very powerful space WYS (V) now posted by Jared Lockwood who ended up winning that tournament.<br />
<br />
From my experience against Jared, I decide to change my WYS (V) to play more with the space aspect and less on the ground. After the tournament, Danny and I spent the next 6 hours fixing our decks and looking for Quad Laser Cannons in the big box oh cards that Bryan had brought. Finally, with both our decks finished and our deck lists done. I got to bed at 4:30. <br />
<br />
Now, for the TR of Nationals that all you guys have been waiting to see, thanks for the wait. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1 - My WYS (V) vs. Danny Packs Weather Vane: Yes, it happened again. I had to play Danny to start the tournament. We had built the darkdeck to play well against WYS (V), but we had not gotten to play a real game against it. So this would be the first true test for my dark deck idea. First turn, he gets the perfect hand pulling the Free Executor Effect, Maul YA, and his stick. So he gave me not one card from Drop (V), and pulled out both Battle Plan and Firepower (V). I also got a pretty good hand pulling Kessel and No Questions Asked (V), Entrenchment (V), the Jungle, and Goo Nee Tay, but didnt pull Chewie or his AT-ST. During his turn I got the Swamp, and my turn I activated first, then pulled another one of my NAQ (V) to see if Chewie or his AT-ST was in my force pile. They were, so I just through out the free cards, saved the sites, drew a few, and waited. I took a drain, and he just drew a few cards, then played Sense/Uncertain is the Future to give me a whole new hand. I got back Chewie (V), and one site. So my turn, I found my other site only have it Defensive Fired/Hutt Smooth away by complete luck. So, what would have been a second turn flip became a third turn flip. Finally, I got out the sites, put Laudica (V) out and Chewie on AT-ST to flip, then moved them over. In the same turn. I had saved enough force to also put out a Corellian Corvette, BoShek (V) for free with Bargaining Table (V) and Leia with Gun from hand. I started Superficial Loses (V) to find a Quad Laser Cannon and battled the lone Executor which still did not have anything on it. He reacted with a Laser Cannon Battery with 3 force saved, but draw Zuckess for the draw. I drew a 5 for the power destiny and a 6 for battle which I added 3 to with NQA(V). It was power 20 to 12. He lost Executor and I retrieved 2 force for firing and winning the battle. The rest of the game nothing really happened. I had a solid drain of 2 on Bespin, 1 at Corellia, and 2 at the Swamp. He must have flashed a ship 4 different times only to not have the matching pilot there. The game ended with me on top by 20.<br />
<br />
FW 2(+20) <br />
<br />
Highs: Killing Executor and not having to lose anything. Also, him not bring out anything that the deck could have done against me. I got very lucky that his deck seemed to just beat itself. <br />
<br />
Lows: Taking that long to flip when I had all the stuff twice in my hand. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2  My Weather Vane deck vs. Stephen Yagers WYS (V) with Vehicles and Sandwhirls: It was weird because Stephen had gotten their late and got the bye, yet I had to play him because everyone else had won by much more. I dont get Maul in my opening hand, but I do get Saber 1 and Miiyoom Onith. I drop down free Executor and Onith and flash Saber 1 to get the Baron for a cheap 4 force to Corellia. His WYS started Captain Han, and NON V Leebo who doesnt add to power, so at the start of the battle, we were both exactly the same; Power 6, with immunity less than 5. I Battle and draw a 4 which Baron makes a 5, his draws a 2. So Han goes lost before he even gets a turn. His turn, he finds General Rieekan (V) with Strike Planning and drops Luke (V), R2 in Red 5 AND X-Wing Cannons all from hand, but doesnt battle. My turn, I still dont have Maul, but know that Rieekan is in his hand, so I Onith him out and get to see his hand which has NO characters in it. He had put out battle plan so, I didnt drain. His turn, he retrieves Rieekan with Luke (V), puts out a Snowspeeder at the desert and kept the Sandwhirl in his hand, battles the Baron only to miss the draw. NQA (V) provide enough that I had to lose him and Leebo went to lost pile. I STILL dont have Maul. So I decide NOT to Onith, which I should have to get Rieekan, but search my deck to see that Tatooine Maul is in my force pile. I draw up to find him and stop. He drains, retrieves with Luke (V), puts out Rieekan (V) and Romas (V) at the Swamp and flips. I drop Tat Maul at the desert, where he tries to Barrier, I Sense it and battle only to find out later that I couldnt have done so with Tat Maul. He loses the Speeder. I move over to the Swamp and remember his text to cause him to flip back. I got a card on Firepower next turn, when he put out Tantive IV (V) to Kiffix and moved the Falcon over there too with Palejo piloting. He gets out Rogue 1 to the Swamp moves the two guys over to wait at the desert. Now, my first big mistake was that I thought I could take Kiffix away with just Mist Hunter, Zuckess and 4-Lom. I was wrong. He drew really good with NQA (V) and I had to lose ALL OF THEM. In the same turn, I forgot to relocate the Executor which now had Lando (V) on it over to Kiffix compliments of Firepower (V). Those two mistakes lost me the game, because I had would not have enongh ships to block all of his drains in space. The game continued with me draining and playing Onith, and him draining for more and retrieving with Luke (V).  Finally, he moved Luke (V) on Red 5 over to Kessel and tried to play On the Edge. He had played Flash of Insight (V) to find a 7 on top. He plays the card only to have Lando (V) lower the draw so his misses and losses Luke (V). TECH!!!! It was already too late in the game tough, and I dont know if I could have pulled out a win, but time was called with me having 9 and him with 16. So I got a Timed loss by 16. <br />
<br />
TL 2(+4)<br />
<br />
Highs: Putting both Captain Han and Luke (V) in lost pile in the same game. <br />
<br />
Lows: Losing the game by my own mistakes, taking WAY too long to find Maul. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3  My Weather Vane vs. Danny Packs WYS (V): AGAIN, this marks the 4th game in two days that I have had to play the person that I build decks with. We both knew our decks inside and out, so it just made for a very tough match up for both of us. He went into the game feeling good because he had already since my WYS beat the floor against the exact same match up. I got a GOD hand with Tat Maul, Stick, and some SAC. My turn, I drop Executor for free, Tat Maul to the Chasm, and save 1 for Barrier. He did his WYS thing and put out Obi with Stick who I Barriered. My turn, I got out Onith to the Executor, battle and put Obi on the Weather Vane for a force lose, then drew some cards. He put out his sites and flipped second turn, giving me a card for Firepower (V). I play Onith for some characters and battled Obi again. His turn came and he drained first then tried to play his Sorry about the Mess combo, but I requested an action after his drain and Disarmed his Obi. My turn, I put out 4-Lom with Gun put Obi on the Vane and used Firepower (V) to get Tat Maul over to the Swamp where Chewie and Laudica were hiding on the AT-ST. This flipped his objective letting me take ANY card I want into hand. I chose Vader with Stick. For the next few turns, I had the win locked. Our version didnt play another site, and with him flipped he had NO way to get a 4 ability character to that site before I would Onith it away. The game was mine, BUT, I got too confident. He put out Mace (V) to the Chasm trying to causing some damage with Maul on Corellia. I could have put out the Vader with stick and played that game, but I didnt and decided to relocate the Executor with Mist Hunter (V) and Zuckess (V) over to Corellia to block his Entrenchment (V). I also decided to relocate 4-Lom with Obi, because I had two cards on Firepower. This would turn out to be the BIGGEST mistake of the whole tournament. His very next turn, he put out one Corellian Corvette and Tantive IV (V) with a Quad Laser Cannon and a TARGETING COMPUTER!!!! That makes the Cannon a lightsaber in space. So during his turn, he battled me and NQA (V) caused me to lose Mist Hunter, Zuckess, and 4-Lom. My turn, I have trapped my Executor at Corellia, so all I can do is pile up guys on the Executor to keep him from beating it down. His turn, he tracks a 6 and 4 to do a combine attack with the Targeting Computer and HIT the Executor with 5 guys on hit. It was game after that. I couldnt pay for drains and he had a solid drain of 3 at the Chasm with Mace (V) and Corellia for 1. I had gotten him down to only 10 so I didnt get dropped that badly. <br />
<br />
FL 2(-6)   <br />
Highs: Using Tat Maul to flip his objective back and disarming Obi.<br />
<br />
Lows: Playing like a Scrub and totally throwing the game away when I had already locked him out of victory. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4  My WYS vs. Pats Huntdown: I went into this game with a lot of confidence because I had already played this exact match up in the V card tournament the day before and won my 21. So, I figured this game would be no different. To start the game, he always pulls Rendelli with Mob Points Combo, then sacks the combo to find Crossfire (V), so it can find Security Precautions (V). In this game, he sacks the Combo to then DEPLOY the Crossfire. He did this before he had even activated first turn. Now, in a different game, I might have been a mean guy and made it stick, but I let him take it into hand and then activate. Turn one, he found the Executor docking bay, and played Look Sir, Droids to make Leebo (V) lost, and drew a few. I drain, drop NAQ(V), put Palejo on Outrider for free, Swamp, Jungle, Laudica, Chewie (V) on AT-ST and Flip first turn. He brings Slave 1 (V) with Boba Fett (V) to Corellia and battles, draws a 1 and I draw enough for him to lose Fett (V). The next few turns we both lose to Visage and I continue to drain him for 3 at Corellia and the Swamp. I had got one of my OOC combos in my opening hand, but tried to put Maul with Stick or Emperor (V) out of play. So, I got my other one and cancelled Visage, only to have him redeploy it the same turn he drops Choke Vader and Lando (V) to the Endor docking bay. Now, I could have just sat back and drained until I had won, but I decided for some dumb reason that it would be a good idea to cancel Visage with Corran Horn and Wedge, RL. His turn he drops Zuckess (V), Fett (V), Bossk with Gun, and Dr. E & Ponda. He put Fetriv Treggv (V) gun on Zuckess, so he has 3 ways to capture someone if he should miss. He battles and captures Corran Horn leaving poor Wedge to the wolves. He placed Crossfire out of play to get two destiny so that would have been game right there, but he drew two 1s for destiny. I lost Wedge and 8 force. With Visage gone, he was only hitting me for 1 force a turn, while I continued the 3. I got out Tantive IV (V) with a guy at his Rendelli for another 2 drain. Game ended with 11 left. <br />
<br />
FW 4(+6)<br />
<br />
Highs: Flipping first turn against Huntdown, him get really really bad draws at the right times.<br />
<br />
Lows: Playing stupid again, and giving him someone to beatdown. It almost lost me the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5  My Weather Vane vs. Micah Wootens Endor Mains and Toys: I knew I had the advantage in this game because no one from the Nashville team had been able to beat this deck with anything other than WYS. My first turn, I got out Maul, YA with stick to the Chasm and the Executor to Bespin with Onith. His turn, he dropped Mace (V) and battled to put Maul on the Vane and I lose a force. My turn, I drop 4-Lom with Gun battle, he plays Blaster Deflection which I grab and Sense. He tried to Sense my Sense, but I also had two Alters in my hand. So with a base of 3 against Mace (+1 per draw with Young Apprentice Maul and -1 defense value with Mob Points combo), Mace was put on the Vane, only to be captured by 4-Lom during Micahs next control phase. The rest of the game just didnt go his way at all. That same turn, he tried to bring Obi with Stick to Maul in the hopes of freeing Mace, but just got Barriered. Then placed on the Vane and captured next control phase. Every control phase from then on out, Onith got all of his power characters. He lost Leia and Qui-Gon to some top drains, and was never able to get anything going until it was over. Win to me by 35. <br />
<br />
FW 6(+41)<br />
<br />
Highs: Finally getting the correct set up with this deck and him throwing me Mace so early. Winning by this much allowed me to <br />
<br />
Lows: None, I wish every game went this way. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6  My WYS vs. Aaron Kingerys Weather Vane Star Destroyers: The win verse Micah shot me up into the top four going into the last game, so if I won this game by a good amount, I knew I would be fine. Aaron had done really well with his Training deck and told me that he had already beaten two WYS (V) decks today with his dark deck, but didnt think they were very challenging match-ups. I had never played against a deck like this, but knew I had to play very well in order to come out on top. He turn, he had started the Security Tower and pulled Lando (V). He pulled a system with Kuat Drive Yards (V) and put out Avenger with Lando (V) to Bespin. My turn, I got a great hand, getting Kessel, NQA(V), Flash of Insight (V), Chewies AT-ST, Goo Nee Tay, and some other good stuff. I had got to use Thrown Back (V) 2 times, and then activate 8, so there was enough force to get out every thing I needed. The only thing was I had activated BOTH Chewies and Laudica, so because I had already put out the Swamp, I had to deploy Palejo for free to the Jungle and then land the Outrider to the Swamp to flip. I had put out Tantive IV (V) with a Quad and had the Power Pivot in my hand. I shuttled Palejo up so I was safe for a turn. His turn, he didnt drain after I put out Battle Plan, and just deploy a guy to the Avenger and drew some more cards. I drained for 3 and deployed the correct ground power with Laudica (V), Chewie (V), and the AT-ST to the Swamp, then shuttle the Outrider back in space. I didnt really think he would come after me, but he did with two Star Destroyers and a Tractor Beam, they were cheap because of Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V) and KDY (V). He battled then played In Range and Our First Catch of the Day to add 4 to the total. He went after the Outrider which was a 6, and drew a 2, which missed. That was huge, because I played Power Pivot on one ship and then reduced the other one with Dash. I drew awesome power and battle destinies, leaving me only have to lose one thing and him with everything going to lost pile. The rest of the game was spent with me draining and playing Flash (V), while he just drained for 1 or 2. I finished him off by putting Mace (V) at the Jungle for another drain. I won by 20.<br />
<br />
FW 8(+61)<br />
<br />
Highs: Him not having any real ground, missing the Outrider, and getting a solid win. <br />
<br />
Lows: Having both Chewies in my force pile as well as Laudica. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So that was it. I had won enough in my last two games to finish the tournament at the 2nd spot going into the final games. Now, going into the final games, Danny was playing Reid in their game 6. Dannys only lose was to me and to Reid the previous game by only 3, so if he won, it would have put him into the top 4. This didnt happen though because near the end of the game, Reid asked for a ruling to WYS (V) because the way the card seem to read was that if the two guys were in a vehicle, they dont count for the Houjix text on the objective, because they are not present at the sight. Mike Carr was the judge, and ruled that they DID NOT count unless they were both outside of an enclosed vehicle. Now, I know for a fact now on the PC that it has been voted that they DO indeed count while both of them are on the vehicle as long as they are both on the vehicle and not split up and of course at a site. Now, I dont know if it would have made any difference in Dannys game, because Reid did play with Control/Set for Stun, but the fact that it was ruled incorrectly right at the moment I was going into the final games made it very hard for me to play my WYS the way it was built. Mike told me that if he was wrong, that he would truly admit it and I was open to blasting him on this report. But, he did make the rule based on how he read the card itself. It just stunk that this could have caused me to lose if I had to play it that way. <br />
<br />
As it turns out, Aaron Kingery had only lost one other game by 1 force, so he took the 3rd spot, which meant that I would be able to not only play him again, but I would get to pick which side I wanted to play. So I got to play the exact same game all over again. I did, and won with pretty much the same out come. This time was by 21. The only difference was, that he did capture the Outrider because he set them up the draw with Drop NON V, but I was able to hit the ship that had them with a Quad plus Sorry about the Mess Combo and just got the Outrider right back. So I won the right to go into the final game.<br />
<br />
So after beating Aaron again, I was 2nd and would have had to play against Reid who truly didnt lose one game in the whole tournament going into our game. He looked at my sheet and saw that I had lost twice with my dark deck. I knew I could have had a chance against him if I just went after his planet with my monster activation and got Tatooine Maul there, but decided to take the deal that Reid presented me to combine the first and second prize money and just split it down the middle. We both got byes into day 2 of Worlds, and I had already designed a V card. Reid is a good player, so I didnt mind taking more money and giving him the title over the possibility of losing and getting less money. If you had read this whole thing by now, you would understand why money would appeal to me. So Congrats Reid, on a flawless Tournament!! <br />
<br />
A few things to add that you will enjoy; as the tournament ended the TN group of us minus Tommy decided to go out to eat after the tournament, Mike Carr went with us. Before we headed out, we decided to drop off our stuff at the room. Mike went too and saw how cool our suite was over his room five blocks away. The funny thing that happened was that I had gone into the bathroom to change my shirt. When I opened the door, Danny was standing there to surprise me with a big HEY!!! which I took the wrong way and decided to rush him only to push him back into the closet which was only made of a small sheet of glass. His body totally DESTROYED the closet giving me a look of pure fear with the idea of having to pay for it to be replaced. Luckily, we got out of it, and I didnt have to turn my prize money into the hotel. <br />
<br />
Bryan had more fun than anyone that came and didn&#39;t really play in any of the tournaments. He bought a box of Coruscant, Theed Palace, Tatooine, Endor, Reflections 3, A New Hope limited, and two complete sets of Reflections 2 foils that also hand a double of all cards but the ultra rares for just $100. Everyone but me jump on that deal. Too bad, I would have liked to get my hands on a set like that. <br />
<br />
Well, thats it. To end, please look at the two decks from this tournament that I posted. I am going to change the Dark deck to better fight against WYS, but will still continue to play this start because it is very very strong against many deck types. Thanks, and See you at Worlds. <br />
