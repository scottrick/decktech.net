<br />
It would also be interesting to test out this apparently awful meta first hand.<br />
<br />
Decks:  I chose WYS v for light, just to see what would happen.  I had never seen it in action before, so I built Reid Smiths version almost card for card.  The minor changes were due to me not owning every card, but it was almost identical.  I have never taken a deck right off DeckTech for a tournament before, but figured that whatever I played for LS would be standard junk so why not?  The changes were  GS1 and Green Leader for a bit of added NPE, instead of Uncontrollable Fury (do not own) and something else.<br />
<br />
For DS I had a multitude of options, including a re-build of my COTVG deck (original posted here as &quot;Pain and Suffering&quot;), a pretty decent Endor Ops deck, an ISB deck with Den Of Thieves (v) abuse, a SYCFA *flip* deck which actually seems to work ok and a weird Scum deck with lots of Jedi-killing tricks and Dannik nastiness (built to specifically combat Endor Mains).  These had all worked ok in playtesting but none were extensively tweaked yet so they will have to appear in later tournaments.<br />
<br />
In the end I went for my Bespin CRv TIEs deck.  I have already posted it here (&quot;TIE the kangaroo down&quot;), before it ever played in a tournament, so I figured I should give it a run.  Some minor changes from the one posted here was: (1) taking out a TIE and adding an extra Emperors Shield (actually makes a big difference); (2) taking out Twilek and adding Luke Luke! (v);  (3) some other change to put in Imperial Decree (v).<br />
<br />
In playtesting the TIEs beat WYS v every time.  I wasnt sure what to make of that, but I figured WYS must be stronger than that and I was playing it wrong, but couldnt work out what I should be doing  I tried turtling or attacking or a bit of both but it did not matter.  I should have realised that WYS maybe wasnt my thing and gone for TRM or something else but more on that later.<br />
<br />
Game 1  LS vs Mark Gibbons (SYFCA Fear)<br />
Mark starts Dreaded Imperial Starfleet v, Crossfire v and YCHF/MP.  He sees my objective and says he has no idea what it does, so I give him a quick summary.  There is a brief debate as to the meaning of the part where non-Corellians deploy +3 to Corellia locations and if that includes permanent pilots.  We decide that Corellian is an attribute only of characters so permanent pilots are exempt.  First turn he drops Rendili with MP, another system and Wakeelmui from hand and grabs Seinar Fleet Systems with Crossfire v and Endor Shield v with YCHF.  I pull a the Swamp on his turn, then on my turn pull the Jungle and drop a twix and Wedge in his ship to Corellia in order to avoid a beatdown  I draw the rest.<br />
Second turn Mark activates a lot and deploys a SD and a squadron (from reserve) and retrieves his lost pile.  My turn I pull No Questions Asked (v) and set up my sites and flip.  So far, so good.<br />
<br />
Mark then drops more SDs, pulls Merryjk with Endor Shield v to get a system.  Also had played some Admirals, FWKTIL (v) and suddenly he holds three systems, putting the pressure on big time.  His activation is huge, thanks to all the systems out and the bonus from NQAv.<br />
I was dealt Legendary Starfighter, and picked up the Falcon the previous turn, so I decided to attack Mark at his weakest system, which was (I think) Devastator with Ozzel on board.  I activated Han, but BoShek was there, so he came down in the Falcon with another random starship and pilot.  Corran also piloting Falcon, for a total of 12 power.  Battle.  He plays Imperial Command to add a destiny.  Draws 5 and 4.  Damn.  Total power of 18.  I draw a 2 for my power destiny and a location for my battle destiny, which becomes a 3 with NQA, for a total power of  17.  This was quite a crucial moment in the game  understatement.  Needless to say I was pretty annoyed.  I had actually Leebo-ed Marks reserve deck the previous turn and seen a 1 on top, but had failed to notice that he had drained it off the top, so that was my bad.<br />
<br />
From there the game kind of played out to its obvious conclusion  Mark Feared me for 4-6 a turn and got some drains, although Entrenchment v capped them at one each.  I harried him where I could, and we had a few minor battles, but the direct damage and TIE retrieval was too much for me.  I set up Padme and Leia (lost Luke (v) off the top to a drain early which hurt) and caused a bit of damage that way.<br />
<br />
Mark also got U3PO down to the Swamp but I managed to move my guys away one turn when Mark did not leave a force so U3PO was safely avoided.  However, the damage was done and a late Sidious for free drains confirmed the win.<br />
So, I was a bit unlucky (also never saw a AWRI combo all game, and only found the Control combos later on), but I am not sure that it would have made a big difference.  Marks deck was a poor matchup and I had found in testing that WYS could struggle against Fear, even without the TIE retrieval.  Mark played his deck very well, setting up the damage very fast and fully deserved the win.  He had several cards to deal with Legendary Starfighter even had I got it down  Overwhelmed etc  although pulling them off would have required some work.<br />
<br />
Strangely, I only lost by 10 in the end, which is weird since I was outplayed from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2  DS vs Mark Gibbons (Endor Mains)<br />
We the closest game, so played again on the reverse side.  Mark started Encampment (v) on the Back Door, Strike Planning, Rycar Ryjerd v and Quick Draw v.<br />
I get dealt the Emperors Shield, so I grab Wakeelmui with YCHF/MP, lose a card from reserve to get Seinar Fleet Systems with Crossfire v and then lose YCHF/MP to get Inconsequential Losses v.  Activate 12 and drop these cards plus Emps Shield to retrieve the 3 in my lost pile.  Also dropped a system with KDYv.  Mark pulled General Solo v.<br />
<br />
Knowing Mark would have all the big mains, I figured I would wait a while before deploying to the Walkway.  Mark activated a lot, dropped Solo, two buddy effects, Mace v (and stick from reserve) and Obi JK v to the Back Door.  I was quite happy with that  mark figured (correctly) I was running EPP Maul x2 and Dr. E combo x2 and did not want to risk losing any of these guys early.<br />
<br />
I activated 18-ish, dropped Arica to block the drain and Vengeance at Naboo and drew.<br />
<br />
Mark dropped Corran Horn to break Aricas cover.  Damn.  He also dropped Quiggy to the Back door, plus another site and put LSRS v there and moved Obi JK over to help Luke.  This was a mistake, since Mark had now put down all his mains, leaving me to put someone at the Walkway relatively safely.  The other buddy effects went down, mostly useless since they generally dont work in space.  Corran uncovered Arica.<br />
<br />
I figured that Mark wasnt playing Grimtash (I dont think I have ever seen him play it and if he did this game he could not find it) so I was drawing up a big hand, ready to hit space when necessary.  Even with a Grimtash I had the Sword in hand to retrieve three of them.  I left Arica to block the drain (Ghhhk in hand), put EPP Maul at the Walkway.<br />
<br />
Mark drained, Arica got beat down and the Ghhhk was played.  I drained for 3 at the Walkway and Naboo and deployed the Emps Sword and a TIE to retrieve my lost pile again.  The idea was the find Arica again and re-deploy at the site where Corran wasnt to block drains again.<br />
<br />
Mark decided to go to space and put T4v and BHv (I think) with some characters for Fodder (Twass and Padme v) to Endor.  It gets a bit hazy now, but Mark managed to keep at least one ship in space for the rest of the game, even though I kept battling, which was a bit annoying, although Padme did not last long.  The problem for him now was that my drains were bigger (Resistance helping) and I was retrieving as well.<br />
<br />
I added to the pain by putting Luke Luke! (v) on Maul, targeting Mace.  Much to my surprise, Mark deployed Princess Leia v with Anakins Lightsaber and Screaming Lando to the Walkway!  We battled there a few times and Mark had the worse of it since my high destiny deck meant I never missed the swings and the hit character went to the Weather Wane (lose a force).  Mace did die once (and returned the next turn) so Luke Luke! went away.<br />
<br />
In the end, my drains at Endor, Naboo and Kashyyyk were a bit much.  I won by 10, exactly offsetting the first result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3  DS vs Paul Sutcliffe (Senate)<br />
Pauls Senate deck is inspired by one on DeckTech and its very strong.  The problem is that he has played it for a little while now so we are mostly familiar with it.  He started Strike Planning, Wokling v and something else.<br />
I do the usual thing  Wak, SFS etc.  Paul flips first turn with the Mothma and Valorum, but here he made a big mistake.  He searched for a battleground (Generator Core) with Mothma v and had activated it!  He drew, but it had already gone the used pile deploying the characters.<br />
<br />
Knowing Pauls space was pretty much HCFx2 I figured I could set up pretty safely, although I couldnt find the Tallon Roll combo.<br />
<br />
Given that Paul could not find his b/g site he invaded mine with Obi/ and other guys.  I battled him there with EPP Maul, but those Senate effects really make it tough, subtracting 3 from battle destiny.  Paul managed to hold the Walkway all game.<br />
<br />
The game was VERY slow, as Paul cancelled my drains and I retrieved everything I lost.  Eventually I started to grind him down.  Arica went to the Walkway to block a drain but Corran Horn stopped that.<br />
<br />
Paul got one drain of 4 (created courtesy of another silly political effect) but the other 4-drains got either Controlled or Resistanced.<br />
<br />
Paul eventually found a HCF and battled my lone TIE in space.  I played APTW, shot my gun, added a destiny with I Cant Shake Him!, added another with Crossfire v OOP.  He played Life Debt.  I drew high enough and HCF went bye-bye.  I lost the TIE and gun to used pile and Ghhhk to lost pile, which I retrieved next turn.  One thing my deck DOES do well is handle HCF attacks!  Now that I had used Crossfire v I needed to be careful to have  4 ability everywhere, but that was ok.<br />
<br />
In the end we ran out of time, and I won by 5-ish cards, 15 life force to 20.  The Senate deck is really annoying, particular the function of taking two random cards from my hand!  Very strange that Paul did not play Grimtash since he often does and I would have thought that Senate would have been a great deck for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4  LS vs Paul Sutcliffe (Tatooine CR Scum)<br />
Pauls Scum deck was thrown together and had some weirdness like Double Laser Cannons and Thermal Detonators.  WYS handled this pretty well and it was a relatively uneventful game.  The only notable event was a EPP Quigon beat of Jabba at the AC which resulted in 15-ish overflow when I drew a 6 and he drew a location.  I ended the game by battling ZinMH and DinP1, shooting ZinMH with the X-wing cannons and causing a truckload of overflow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5  LS vs Adam Radic (Naboo CR Dueling)<br />
Adam started Naboo, the two generator sites, Bad Feeling v, Combat Response, Security Precautions v (at one of the sites) and IOA/SP.  He deployed Lord Vader v to the 3/2 site and dropped Epic Duel.  I decided to avoid that site!<br />
I took several turns to flip WYS since I could not find the damn characters.<br />
<br />
Adam put Baron at Naboo second turn and EPP Emperor at the 2/2 site, resulting in a total drain of 6, which he did once while I struggled to find cards.<br />
<br />
Eventually I flipped, with Corran, Mirax and Laudica v, who I moved together at the Swamp.  Adam activated heaps and dropped EPP Maul and Dr E combo to the Swamp, paying the full price.  No barrier.  Corran and Mirax got operated on and Laudica and my Houjix also went to the lost pile.  As far as I can tell, WYS does not have much to stop this happening, and certainly not much to get rid of these two nasties once they are down.  I guess adding Klorslug v is the obvious thing.  Adam held a Corellia site with them for the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
Adam reinforced Naboo with MH v with Zuckkus v and BFBH and 4-lom aboard.<br />
<br />
I found Luke v and got him down with a few other ships including GS1.  I deployed Kessel and moved Luke there and everyone else to Naboo to fight in space.<br />
<br />
Strangely Adam did not battle.  I suppose that was smart play since he was well ahead on the drains and did not know what nasty tricks I had.  He ran away to Corellia (after landing Baron at the Naboo DB just at the time I had nothing to attack him with!).  I drained at Kessel and Naboo and dropped some guys to the Jungle.  Adam then chased them around the Corellia sites for the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
As with the game against Mark, the AWRI combos and the Control combos were very elusive.  I got some more drains in at Kessel (capped to 2) and I chased Adams fleet around, but the drains at Naboo were bad and he got me in the end.  Lost by 10-ish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6  DS vs Neil Kane (HB with musician weirdness)<br />
Neil started Rebel Planners v, Uh Oh v and Superficial Damages v.  I kind of get a bad taste in the mouth when all three effects are virtual  does that mean the v-cards are too dominant?  Im not sure <br />
<br />
Anyway, I was a bit slow to set up this time  decided to wait and see what his deck did.  Fortunately, it did not do a lot.  Neil apparently had lots of trouble finding his ships and some other crucial cards  the deck did not perform well all day and he was sick of it  I know how he felt.<br />
<br />
I decided to stay with my strategy against Paul  I deployed a squadron to retrieve my initial lost pile (always nice to get back CRv for some nice abuse later on) and then a couple of capitals as bait.  I figured that Neil would not be packing Alter so I moved the squadron from Wak to Naboo on a Dreadnaught (I pulled Oppressive Enforcement anyway).  It turned out he DID have Alter but never got to use it.<br />
<br />
I got a couple of drains in, we both pulled systems and I put EPP Maul at the Walkway.  Neil deployed EPP Obi and EPP Luke and battled.  Again my uber-high destinies came in handy as Obi missed and Luke went to the Weather Vane.  Maul and Obi were lost but Maul was retrieved and a second Maul in my hand was deployed.<br />
<br />
Later, a second Obi came down with Luke and the same thing happened, except this time Luke and then Obi went to the Weather Vane, so Luke was lost  theres only room for one on that flimsy Weather Vane v.  For the rest of the game Obi went to the Weather Vane and back  5 or 6 times I think.  Maul went only once, so everyone was having great fun.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in space I decided to deploy more stuff  had TIEs and/or capitals at Kiffex, Naboo and Kashyyyk.  Neil got his ships going  Nebulon-B Frigates with either X-wing cannons or Turbolaser Batteries.  Weird.  BTW, I am still not sure if the X-wing cannons really can deploy on the Neb-B but thats ok.  We had a few odd battles in space.  Neil tried to shoot a TIE with the cannons but a Dark Maneuvers after the destiny draw saved it.<br />
At this point Lee Clarke on the next table looked over and said in his most deadpan sarcastic voice, Wow, two space decks with weapons, which was quite funny.<br />
<br />
So, Neil battled, the TIEs and guns would go to the used pile and I would re-deploy and retrieve.  This happened quite a bit.  Neil was pretty frustrated that the Laser cannons could not shoot the squadrons.  The only musician I saw was Joh who did absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Neil cancelled my drains so I went searching for his base.  As usual, it was the last place I tried.  Finally Neil said youve forgotten your own deck and I remembered that my old B-wing deck (posted here  won me a tournament and was pretty great back in the day) had the trick of using Dantooine as the HB, so DS would have to move a ship over there to probe which I could then shoot down in the control phase with Stay Sharp! And he could not probe!  Anyway, that was Neils strategy as well.  I moved a Dreadnaught and a squadron over to Clakdor VII and HB went OOP.<br />
<br />
It was a pretty funny end as Neil was SOOOO sick of his deck and wanted to end it.<br />
I won by 25-ish.<br />
<br />
<br />
The result was that I came third which was a bit silly as I never played the winner, Lee Clarke and lost my only game to Adam, who came second.  The trick to tournaments is to lose the first game so you will tend to avoid the leader :-)<br />
<br />
Final standings and decks:<br />
Lee Clarke:  Walkers and Speeders<br />
Adam Radic:  Naboo CR duelling and something I never saw<br />
Me:  Bespin CR TIEs and WYS v<br />
Neil Kane:  AOBS and HB<br />
Mark Gibbons:  SYCFA and Endor Mains<br />
Paul Sutcliffe:  Tatooine Scum and Senate<br />
<br />
OK, that brings me to some final comments on WYS (v), which is kind of the reason I posted this report.  Just because a deck wins for some people doesnt mean it will win for you.  I think that certain decks are suited to certain people and perhaps WYS is not my kind of deck.  WYS seems to require a fair bit of skill to play well - its neither a turtling deck nor a battling deck but its meant to be able to do both, depending on the situation - that requires practice.<br />
<br />
That said, even though I played it badly, missing a fair few things and making lots of little mistakes, I still lost by only 10 on the two games I lost.  In the game against Mark I felt I was a bit unlucky, but also that his deck would probably win most times anyway.  The game against Adam I could have played better - perhaps pulled out a win with more experience - the &#39;standard&#39; build plays Uncontrollable Fury, which I did not have, which would have been huge in that game since Adam deployed Lord Vader (v) first turn.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I never felt very comfortable playing deck, which is the biggest problem - I played it because I was curious about it and I wanted to try something different.  I dont know if I will try it again.  It was ok, but did not really have that fun factor which makes you play again.  I love my TIEs.  Even when they lose (not often) its still great playing with them.  However, there is no light side deck which is really that interesting.  I find that more depressing than the fact that DS is weaker  I would always choose to play DS simply because its more interesting.  I think everyone at the tournament found the LS decks boring.  Mark really only went through the motions with Endor Mains because its dull.  I did not get the feeling that Lee enjoyed the Speeders much either.<br />
<br />
Neil should take some props for playing something different, but he paid the price for  playing something different.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I was very pleased with the solid performance of the TIEs, particularly against a variety of deck types  one ground (Endor Mains) one space (HB) and one NPE does-nothing manipulating stupid deck (Senate).  I really think that the TIEs are pretty good.  I still dont know how to interpret my playtesting against WYS since Ive proved that WYS and me dont mix.  However, I have played a lot of TRM successfully and the TIEs also do well against that  give the TIEs a try.  You might not win worlds but if you prepare right then youll cause some problems.<br />
<br />
Props and slops:  Meh, this is long enough already.  Props as always to Paul for running the thing.<br />
