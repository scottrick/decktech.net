11-30-02<br />
<br />
So here I am, writing another TR after so long of not doing so. I&#146;ve been working here on DeckTech&#146;s buzz boards trying to help out my Watto, and I&#146;m happy with it. I dropped the DBO for QMC, because Shaner knows DBO&#146;s weakness is ISB, and I&#146;m sure he&#146;s playing it. That would turn out to be quite the decision in this tournament.<br />
<br />
I&#146;ve been defeated far too many times in the recent past for my liking. Playtesting games have just not gone my way. But that&#146;s fine - I&#146;ve massed up my abilities and I think I&#146;m finally ready to return some of the damage done.<br />
<br />
I arrive fashionably late, but the games haven&#146;t started yet. Cool. I talk to my recruit padawan and replace one of his 2 Free Ride/Celebration combos for just a Celebration so I can have the Free Ride combo in my deck. I didn&#146;t know I put both of my copies in his deck, so I was without one! I also gave him the enlarged Hunt Down objective card because that&#146;s pure tech. I also see that Charles Hickey is in the crowd. He says hi to me, and it takes me a moment and a double-take to realize who he is, but we chat for a bit. We talk about the Vegas DPC from 2 years ago - that was just good fun. We also try to remember past tournaments, and I think I&#146;ve won 4 total. Coolness! I&#146;m happy now. The pairings are eventually called, and we just stay where we are.<br />
<br />
DARK: Watto mains - because mains are all you can play anymore<br />
LIGHT: QMC mains - because mains are all you can play anymore<br />
After being reset, my rating is 1652. Ranked #2800. Oh joy.<br />
<br />
GAME 1: My Watto vs. Charles Hickey&#146;s We Have A Plan (1846)<br />
<br />
Great. It&#146;s my direct damage vs. his, and he activates so much he can afford to pay the 2. I get Reegesk and Watto to their spots and flip for 1, but he started Don&#146;t Do That Again so I can&#146;t get my Executor or my Search &amp; Destroy. Whatever. I look in my hand - 2 EPP Vaders, EPP Maul, Tatooine Maul. Um, okay. That works for me. I throw Vader in the Throne Room and wait to see what he will do to determine which Maul I put in the chamber. I&#146;m really interested to see his choice of Queen. If it&#146;s the ability 4, then I&#146;ll drop EPP Maul. If it&#146;s not, then Tatooine Maul will wreak some gametext-havoc across the Throne Room. I save 1 for my Ghhhk in case he has Draw Their Fire, and he just might think I&#146;m holding a Barrier at the same time. Coolness.<br />
<br />
He gets his Naboo underwater sites going for activation and draws. I throw down Tatooine Maul because I refuse to let Vader die. Palpatine goes next door and I search for a DB. I get it, but I&#146;ve activated my Force Lightning. Crap. I&#146;ve got a Ghhk and a Projective, so I&#146;m not too worried about letting Palpy hold the site on his own. It&#146;s not like he can do anything about it anyway with his objective. I get the extra drain for a little while at least and draw a few. In the draw, I get 4LOM and Dr. E.<br />
<br />
I love this deck.<br />
<br />
He gets the Queen &amp; crew ready at the first site, but he hasn&#146;t found Ascention Guns yet. He doesn&#146;t move over. Um, okay.<br />
<br />
I throw Dr. E and 4LOM for the guy who says I can&#146;t target leaders. After that, he&#146;ll never even attempt to flip his objective. I draw a few to build a hand against what he might be able to do to Watto and Reegesk.<br />
<br />
Qui-Gon eventually drops down on Watto, but he gets the Barrier I just drew. We battle back and forth several times, and his Jedi Resiliances keep him coming back for more. He also puts out the Brian Hunter Bacta Tank, which reads &quot;When this card is on the table, Brian Hunter can never lose.&quot; Signed by the man himself. Coolness. He eventually kills Watto, and I spend a turn finding him again. He dies again, and I drop No Escape to get him back. He dies again. Obi has joined the party by now and has killed off Reegesk, netting my 2nd Ghhhk (I used the first with EPP Qui vs. Watto). Now I&#146;ve got him wondering (a) how many Ghhhks I play, and (b) why the heck he didn&#146;t catch the first one. ;-) I finally find my last remaining destiny-drawing characters and clear him away from Tatooine for good. Obi escaped by hiring Nabrun to take him to the Bridge of my Battleship. How that can actually logistically happen escapes me at the moment. Watto stays at his junkyard, tired as all hell from the battles he just survived. Xizor moves next door to keep me flipped. I also deploy my CHYBC shield to keep him from draining at my bridge, and the drain race begins.<br />
<br />
I&#146;m ahead in Force by about 5-6, and we&#146;re down to the last 3 turns. We&#146;re also down to the last 3 minutes. By now, not much has happened on Naboo except I&#146;ve moved Palpatine up to the rest of the crew and deployed Janus for the extra drain. Bibble is next door, so it brings it back to 2. He&#146;s saving 2 and obviously not going to lose 2 at this point, so I can&#146;t bluff with my Force Lightning. Crap. He moves Boss Nass and Rep Been up to a battleground for a drain of 1 and satisfying CHYBC, so I&#146;m pretty much done. Time is called after I activate my Force, and I can&#146;t win. I search through my deck and find that I can take something totally random into hand, then I drain him 4 and bluff with my crap card to lose it and 2. He drains me out to get the full win instead of a timed win.<br />
<br />
FL by 9<br />
0 (-9)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: This was just a good matchup. Hickey&#146;s deck apparently went 4-0 at the Endor Regional, so I don&#146;t feel too bad. I made him fight for it.<br />
THE BAD: If I had bothered to really read into his objective, I think I could have won by leaving Palpatine and Janus next door to the Throne Room.<br />
THE UGLY: I couldn&#146;t kill his Qui-Gon! Obi using Nabrun to escape to my Bridge and win with it. I caught the Nabrun, but the damage was done. The really bad thing is that I was considering playing an Oota-Goota, Solo just to take care of that problem. Oh well.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: This was a fun game, and I&#146;ve never actually played against Hickey before in a sanctioned game. Good game.<br />
<br />
So here we go. Good ol&#146; Viper starting off with a loss. That&#146;s just what I wanted. Time to beat up on a scrub, right?<br />
<br />
Oh, no, my friends. Of course not.<br />
<br />
GAME 2: My QMC vs. Chris Shaner&#146;s ISB Scum (1834)<br />
<br />
Yeah, Shaner&#146;s back down to 1834. Current Ratings Undo-ing Decipher (or CRUD, for short), has deleted his account and he&#146;s got to start over again. Decipher has a process they reserve for this guy, and all other high-rated players named Chris, actually. That process is called: &quot;Fearlessly Undoing Chris Kills Everything Done&quot; and they have done it to Chris Shaner. Figure that one out on your own, folks.<br />
<br />
I&#146;ve never beaten Shaner&#146;s ISB. I haven&#146;t even come close. This is his prized deck. Too many Outer Rim Scouts to count, most (if not all) of them are foiled now. I swear - Shaner has more copies of ORS than I have rares in my entire collection. This is the deck that beat up on Brian Hunter at the Vegas DPC 2 years ago and went undefeated (I think) in the same event. This is his baby. I start Menace Fades instead of Wokling because I know there&#146;s no way I&#146;m going down to Jabba&#146;s Palace to defeat him.<br />
<br />
I draw my starting hand, and my eyes go wide. Not only do I have Blount in my starting hand - a character I added just for this matchup - but I&#146;ve also got all 3 sites. I drop Corran Horn against his Vigo and ORS just to take a little damage from him before he can do anything about it. Turns out I draw a 2, which is nullified by Hutt Influence. His guys were also forfeit +2, so I would have only killed 1. Corran Horn dies in vain. Crap. I search for Artoo in R5 with Luke next turn, but it&#146;s not there. Crap. No flip for me. I draw a few (and it winds up being several) trying to get a ground character for the flip other than Rambo Calrissian. Whatever. This is turning out to be a really crappy game that just happened to have a good starting hand.<br />
<br />
Next turn I get Blout to Coruscant to flip him to 0, and Wedge with his gun backs him up. Ric, Lando, and the Lars family flip my objective, and I find my Antilles Manuever. Total coolness. He drops Jabba&#146;s Sail Barge with an ORS aboard to fight me, but I Barrier. He throws Fett aboard anyway. Next turn, Han Chewie &amp; Falcon get a Barrier, but Luke gets through. I also grabbed Power Pivot from the Force Pile. I initiate and topdeck and Obi to drop his power to 0. He draws a 3, and I let it stand. His next is a 4, and I cancel. I draw a blind 5 and have huge power to his 3. He loses everything and 5 more, I stay where I am because HCF can&#146;t move and Wedge can&#146;t make it to Bespin.<br />
<br />
Zuckuss, 4LOM, and an Outer Rim Scout head to Bespin to make work of Ric. He clears me and cancels Celebration, which I retrieve next turn with Wokling. I move HCF and Luke over with a Spiral in hand. He drops Bossk and initiates against me. He draws 9 to kill Luke, I draw a 6 and something to get rid of Bossk and his ORS. HCF is alone against Zuckuss and 4LOM. I activate and search my Force Pile - no Luke. I get my All Wings combo instead. I show my Artoo in Red5 to get him out of the deck and initiate. I play All Wings to make one of my destinies an 8, and the next is a 6. Coolness. I clear him off and a few, and I lose the Falcon because I don&#146;t want to pay upkeep.<br />
<br />
At this point, Shaner has lost 2 of 3 key battles (the 3 ONLY battles, actually). He&#146;s still flipped and will remain that way all game, he&#146;s not retrieving anything because I&#146;ve caught his Abyssin Ornament and Aim High is out, he has to pay for drains &amp; I don&#146;t, and he doesn&#146;t get any bonuses from those drains. That&#146;s game. As he&#146;s drawing up, I see that I&#146;ve got a Rebel Reinforcements in my hand. Unfortunately, I&#146;ve got a 7 (or 0) on top of the deck and only 6 active Force. I decide not to open myself to ridicule and don&#146;t play it. :-)<br />
<br />
FW by 12<br />
2 (+3)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: I beat Shaner&#146;s baby! Not many people can say that.<br />
THE BAD: Not many people SHOULD say that, now that I go read it again. Slops to me.<br />
THE UGLY: Activating Luke. Not activating any ground. Shaner getting his head handed to him on a platter in that awe-inspiring power 3 vs. MY ENTIRE FLEET (minus a Barriered Falcon) battle.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: Actually, I&#146;m going to deliver slops here. Shaner&#146;s a good guy and put up a good game, but he kept stopping our game to help his nephew sitting next to us play his game. I don&#146;t mind if you help out the newbs, dude. But if you bring them into a sanctioned tournament setting, you can&#146;t play their games for them. I doubt Scot will make the trip to your tournies anymore because of this, and I certainly can&#146;t blame him. His matchup read &quot;Scot vs. Skyler,&quot; not &quot;Scot vs. Skyler AND Shaner.&quot; Just don&#146;t do it to me. &#146;Nough said.<br />
<br />
I won&#146;t get into the rant of Shaner playing Skyler&#146;s game for him - even to the point where he picked up his hand and played an entire turn for the kid. I&#146;m disappointed that he did it. Anyway, I start writing my notes and talk to Scot about it as the next pairings are called. Again, I&#146;m not going anywhere.<br />
<br />
GAME 3: My Watto vs. Scot Vales&#146;s Rescue The Princess (1671 &amp; 1577)<br />
<br />
We know our decks inside out, as Scot is my playtesting partner. I&#146;ve got the advantage, and we both know it. This was simply an amazing game for me. He plays his DDTA shield after I pull the Executor, but I flip with Reegesk and Watto anyway. No Search &amp; Destroy for me! I throw P-59 at the Yavin DB and put out Bad Feeling. I&#146;ve also got a Projective Telepathy in hand, so there&#146;s nothing he can do to kill me. Cool. He gets R2 and finds that he can&#146;t deploy Obi. He moves R2 to the Death Star. I drain for 2, 1, and 1, and he topdecks his 8d8 in all that mess. He&#146;s nice enough to let me deploy my Palpatine to R2&#146;s location. I search for my Force Lightning and pull the docking bay I always forget about, and I mention to Scot that I&#146;ve just pulled my last 0 out of my deck and I need a -1 for this to fail. I zap Artoo out of existance and, Reegesk convinces him to join the Dark Side next turn. I also grab 8D8 the following turn, and that Princess is as good as gone.<br />
<br />
I deploy Blizzard 4 (and Vader with it) to Reegesk&#146;s side, because now he&#146;s just going to be upset. I let Reegesk go inside the Walker for protection and bluff his R2. He pays, and I drop it next to Bliz 4 so I get the Scomp Link. He&#146;s playing the original ANH R2-D2, after all. Vader moves to Watto. He throws a deploy 8 Ax-Lando at Watto &amp; Vader (6, -2 for Tatooine, +2 for Bad Feeling, +2 for His Name Is Anakin), and can&#146;t battle because of Projective. I beat the snot out of Lando, but Vader actually gets excluded because I draw a 1 for the destiny, and Lando draws a 4. Crap. I lose a low destiny from hand, and he loses the hit Lando.<br />
<br />
The best he can do is drop Rambo Calrissian to his Battle Plains for the drain of 2, but then the coolest thing ever happens. I&#146;ve got his R2 at my site, and he deploys EPP Luke to Palpatine. He tries to battle, but I tell him I want an action after he deploys Luke. I use Force Lightning Lost. I draw a 5 - HIS 8d8!!! Then I deploy my Han, Chewie, &amp; Falcon to his Death Star DB for the drain of 1. Not only is Reegesk broken, he provides quite the comic relief.<br />
<br />
FW by 38<br />
4 (+41)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: Aside from me knowing his deck inside out and my having the advantage anyway, I just got everything I needed exactly when I needed it.<br />
THE BAD: I hate beating up on Scot - he&#146;s my buddy.<br />
THE UGLY: Ax-Lando deploying for 8 and not being able to battle? Ouch!<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: This was still a fun game, and Scot&#146;s a good sport. I could have lost this game by 38 instead of won, and it would have still been fun. The players determine whether this game is worth continuing, and we could use more with Scot&#146;s attitude and outlook.<br />
<br />
Well, that helped out. If I can get a good win out of this next game, I should place high this week. I&#146;m excited about it.<br />
<br />
GAME 4: My QMC vs. Glenn Gordon&#146;s Hoth Walkers (1516)<br />
<br />
I like Glenn - he&#146;s my buddy. But I&#146;m gonna have to stomp on him this game to have a chance. QMC is a great matchup vs. Walkers anyway, and I again start Menace Fades instead of Wokling. I get Luke to space quickly, and it&#146;s now that I realize I didn&#146;t put virtual game text on my 2nd Luke. So instead I get an extra activation. Um, okay. He throws an Imperial Class Star Destroyer to Hoth, finds Alert My Star Destroyer, deploys Ozzel, moves him up, and *BOOM*! Suddenly it&#146;s immune to all attrition. Whatever. I get Bravo 1 &amp; 2 to Hoth, his destiny is 5, but I tell him it&#146;s actually 3 cause of Dolphe. Then I get my 3 flips, and he&#146;s starting to realize that the last 2 sets really were nothing but pure power to sell cards. 2 scrub pilots getting 3 destinies and limiting his down far enough so I&#146;m immune is great. He doesn&#146;t want to let go of the system, so he topdecks 10 instead. That works for me.<br />
<br />
He never does manage to get to Bespin, and he just tries to stack up on Hoth. Another Star Destroyer comes down, but he gets Barriered. I throw down Dash in the Outrider with Rambo Calrissian along for the ride, because Reflections 3 just has too much power not to use it. I flip 4, he draws less than 2, so he loses it all. I move Dash to Luke on Bespin and leave the Bravo pilots at Hoth with a Spiral in hand just in case Zuckuss decides to pay a visit. He&#146;s really not going to like it if he does that, though.<br />
<br />
Turns out he doesn&#146;t. Between the 2 destroyers and the loss of 10, his space fleet is trashed. TWO NABOO PILOTS DESTROYED THE ENTIRE IMPERIAL STARFLEET, PEOPLE. That&#146;s amazing. There&#146;s something not right about these last few sets. Decipher trying to make some money, perhaps? hmmm.....<br />
<br />
Menace Fades stays in effect, I take his damage of 2 and drain of 1, and he&#146;s done.<br />
<br />
FW by 24<br />
6 (+65)<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: Everything was so good about this game for me.<br />
THE BAD: Everything was so bad about this game for him.<br />
THE UGLY: 2 Naboo pilots bringing the Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to its knees? Weak.<br />
PROPS TO OPPONENT: He&#146;s learning, he&#146;s still playing. He made it to the top 4 instead of the bottom 4, so he&#146;s still doing okay for himself.<br />
<br />
I check the scores, and I&#146;m actually tied with Shaner, point for point. Since I had a win by 38, I pull off the win for the tournament. I turn to Hickey and tell him that I&#146;m changing my previous answer to 5 instead of 4. It was a good turnout, but NO TOURNAMENT FOILS??? Crap. The store doesn&#146;t have any SW:CCG packs, so I get 2 Yugi packs instead. Not bad for a free tournament.<br />
<br />
I talk tech with Vales &amp; Hickey, and my padawan Grayson sits down with us. We talk about broken decks of the past and the now. I start explaining my SuperTwix idea, and he just can&#146;t hide the smile on his face. We could see the wheels turning as I explained to him that it can give you 22 Force on turn 2-3 without giving up a single icon and has the ability to pull every site early, leading to hardcore beats. It can also give you that 1 battleground for Menace Fades &amp; Battle Plan, and it can flip to give -1 drains to your opponent, give you good drains, and be able to satisfy I Hope She&#146;s Alright. We go outside and fight with Hickey&#146;s toy lightsabers in the parking lot for awhile and finally get going.<br />
<br />
PROPS:<br />
* Samurai Comics for hosting us &amp; giving prize support, despite the tournament being free. THIS STORE ROCKS! I&#146;ll definitely come back here.<br />
* Shaner for hosting events in the Phoenix area. We needed something.<br />
* My buddy Grayson for still playing<br />
* My buddy Hickey for playing with us<br />
* My buddy Scot for making the hour drive to play<br />
* Everyone else who came<br />
* All my opponents for being good sports, win or lose<br />
<br />
SLOPS:<br />
* Shaner for playing Skyler&#146;s game for him - you know better<br />
* Me for forgetting that I play a Docking Bay and a way to deploy it from the deck<br />
* Me for beating up on Scot &amp; Glenn so badly because I wanted the points<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! See you next time.<br />
