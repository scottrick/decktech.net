<br />
11 participants<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++PRE-TOURNEY+++++++<br />
<br />
My decks:<br />
LS: TRM starting Insurrection combo, Draw Their Fire, and Colo Fish<br />
DS: CCT starting Special Delivery v, Kuat Drive Yards v, and YCHF combo except against throne room<br />
<br />
Not much to say here except I got a big fat zero hours of sleep the night before. Not a wink. I laid down at like 12 but insomnia  was owning me so I got up around 3 for a snack and then again at 4 to play some nintendo and then when 5 oclock rolled around i figured i&#39;d just skip on sleep for the night. So i put Full Metal Jacket in the dvd, double-checked my decks, ran through a shower, and hit the road a little after 6, bound for the city of Pittsburgh to pick up my traveling companions.<br />
<br />
I arrived at the residence of Dan Tortellini, King of the Scrubs, a little before 7. Very shortly after we were joined by Pat Johnson and Ricky Ricardo, and the RSmith One is packed and headed up interstate 79. The drive was uneventful, I allowed Ricky to peruse my dark deck in hopes that he could come up with a valid suggestion or two for removal, as I am trying to squeeze certain cards in. But no dice. We bumped some of Dan&#39;s burned cds and the kids played some gameboy and before we knew it we were there.<br />
<br />
The tourney was held at this park which was cool except I didn&#39;t bring a football....which i instantly regretted upon exiting my vehicle at the destination. There was a group of cars parked outside this little building near the front of the park so I parked there, and said &quot;I think the tournament&#39;s in that building.&quot; Ricky disagreed, saying, &quot;If the tourney&#39;s in there I&#39;m going home&quot; or something ridiculous like that. &quot;I think we should drive up the road more and look for where the tournament really is being held.&quot; But I walked up to the building and gave the door a try, and sure enough...gamers. We filed in, paid our money, scribbled our decklists, and settled down for....<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME ONE<br />
My dark vs. Tortellini&#39;s Hidden Base<br />
aka game 1 vs a putzburgh local<br />
<br />
I got Bespin system in my opening hand so I was able to deploy the Executor first turn with virtual Lando piloting, which would deny Dan the use of his General Calrissian. He tried to fight me on like turn 2 with Dash and the Outrider and someone else, the someone else died and I lost some forfeit fodder. He was left with Dash in Outrider in front of my Executor and Lando and no force in force pile to move away...<br />
<br />
I went and dropped Flagship V, Ozzel, and the Avenger, then Lateral Damaged the Outrider and beat him down for 29. I had been hoping to pull First Strike from my deck with Special Delivery, but it was not there, so if he had had a Houjix he would have been alright. Sadly, he did NOT have a Houjix, and Dash and the Rider went to the lost pile along with 24 more cards.<br />
<br />
FW by 33<br />
Recap: typical game against dan i guess, heh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME TWO<br />
My light vs. Pat Johnson&#39;s CCT Scum<br />
aka game 2 vs a putzburgh local<br />
<br />
He neglected to get Lando once per game, but neither of us would deploy Lando at all so it ended up not mattering in the slightest. He started with Location^3 v, Special Delivery v, and I think Ability ^3 v, and used the first of those to get Tatooine: Jabba&#39;s Palace, which would allow him (in conjunction with his objective) to get out all the 2/1 Jabba&#39;s Palace sites first turn. Except he used the game text on Tat:JP to get the Dungeon first turn this game.<br />
<br />
I got a pretty average start with an early Jedi Council Chamber and Yoda Mofo. He yanked the TinT/OE combo card effect with Special Delivery, which was annoying but not beyond my scope of dealing with. He was slow in setting up, and pretty soon I had deployed characters to the Carbonite Chamber (Obi-wan), Jabba&#39;s Palace (Qui-Gon), and my Coruscant Docking Bay (Yoda), so I had some solid drains set up. He spent a turn or two getting Mighty Jabba, Ephant Mon, and Gailid at the Audience Chamber, but because of Battle Plan I think he drained only once or twice all game. I got Goo Nee Tay out pretty early and he put out Molator but I just canceled it with Grimtaash.<br />
<br />
So finally Pat came down with some mandalorian character, Fett or Kast, on one of my guys and tried to Hidden Weapons, but I just Sensed and we cleared off. Then my guy got Resilienced and re-deployed to drain some more. Any time Pat tried to do anything I just threw guys out to kill his guys, and my drains at his 2/1 sites took their toll sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
FW by 25<br />
Recap: well I was a little leery of facing this deck, as I knew he was playing Hidden Weapons/Bossk with Mortar Gun/Lando virtual madness, but the HW only reared its ugly head once and was quickly Sense-ola&#39;ed. And like I said he forgot all about Lando.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME THREE<br />
My light vs Matt Pietrangelo&#39;s Watto<br />
<br />
He started with IAO combo, Ket Maliss v, and some effect I cannot remember. <br />
I got a so-so opening hand with some decent characters but no sites. I did get my We Wish To Board At Once though so I played it first turn to get Honor Of The Jedi to help me deal with his objective. He took a turn or two to set up, then came down with Blizzard 4 to the Junkyard (pull EPP Vader), Watto also, Greedo v to Mos Espa, and he put a card back in his deck with his objective. Then he bumped Greedo over to join the party at the Junkyard and hopped Vader out of the walker (wish I was playing Fury).<br />
<br />
I eventually got the Jedi Council Chamber out along with my Coruscant Docking Bay and moved Yoda out there to drain (sound familiar?). Then Qui-gon went to Mos Espa. Matt pulled Special Edition Coruscant Docking Bay, but neither of us caught that I had already deployed Coruscant Docking Bay, and we treated it as a separate site all game (doh!). That turned out to be advantageous to me as I dropped Phylo Gandish to the Home One Dockbay and transited her over to his Coruscant DBay to drain for 3 all game. However, even if we had realized the mix-up, he had also deployed the Death Star II DBay, so I could have moved Phylo there instead. Somewhere in here he drew up to 12 cards in hand, then on a subsequent turn searched with Ket Maliss to take Reegesk v into hand. I immediately Grimtaashed him used.<br />
<br />
So yeah, he was activating about 9 or 10 force a turn and not paying to drain me at the Junkyard and not doing any damage with Watto cuz A) Qui-Gon was holding down Mos Espa and B) I had Honor out. He did some more drawing while I paid to drain (never went over 12 cards again though) and I figured he was looking for his No Escape. And he was. That hit the table and he dropped Regis to Mos Espa and damaged me with Watto. I had 2 force saved but the smart play was definitely to lose 2. He also got the Episode 1 Tatooine system out (which was how he was generating 10 force a turn) and tried to hold that so that Battle Plan wouldn&#39;t hurt him, but that didn&#39;t work out so well. He put out Dengar v in Punishing One v (now I remember his third starting effect - Combat Response) along with DS-61-2 in Black 2 v all in one turn, but I retaliated with Craaazy Lando and EPP Luke in the Spiral. I had a 6 on the Fish so all I needed was to draw a 5 as one of my two battle destinies and the 11 in attrition would remove all ability from the system. Well I drew a 6 and a 5 so I didn&#39;t even need to switch the 6 off the Fish, and Dengar, DS612, and Black 2 all went to the lost pile. He drew a 3 for battle destiny and tried to tell me he was going to add 5 to attrition with Punishing One, but I told him last time I checked the Spiral was not a starfighter. So Luke hit the lost pile (Resilience?) and Lando stuck to hold down the system.<br />
<br />
From there on out I had free drains and he didn&#39;t, so that about does it. He did come kick Phylo&#39;s wookie with Dr Evazan but I declined to draw battle destiny and Houjixed so that I could return fire with Corran Horn and EPP Luke (or Obi?) the next turn.<br />

Recap: Again I was leery about this game as I had not played against Watto in some time, and had removed many cards from my deck that are good against it (Tauntaun Bones, OOC, Sorry About the Mess combo). Going into the game Matt expressed some serious unhappiness at the matchup but I wasn&#39;t going to take it lightly. And on a totally unrelated note, every time I drained him with Qui-Gon at Mos Espa, he lost 2 force, even though my drains are -1 there... oh well (shrug)<br />
<br />

<br />
Somewhere in here we took a lunch break, pretty lame actually as we just went to McDonald&#39;s. Yawn and I laid down on a bench and took like a 5-minute nap.<br />
GAME FOUR<br />
My dark vs Ricky Ricardo&#39;s WHAP<br />
aka game 3 against a putzburgh local<br />
<br />
For the record, Ricky&#39;s real last name is Sparvero. He&#39;s been playing this WHAP deck nonstop forever and he&#39;s half-decent with it. It&#39;s a pretty unique design, too. I know that in this game I need to get my Imperial Decree v workin as quick-like as possible.<br />
<br />
He started Get To Your Ships, Wokling, and Civil Disorder i think? I looked at my opening hand and it had 7 red cards and a Star Destroyer. I yanked the Executor and Lando and set up at Bespin system first turn, he dropped Secure Route v, Queen Amidala, and Captain Pancake first turn to the Throne Room for a flip. On my second turn I went looking with Special Delivery v and Decree was there but I got Flagship v instead. I dropped Presence of the Force on Bespin and Chiraneau on the Ex cuz I forgot that he loses no more than 2 force to any drain with flipped WHAP. He started damaging me with his objective and spreading out on Naboo. He played Control/Tunnel Vision and I had no force saved, but I grabbed it the second time he played it. I put some random mofo I can&#39;t remember at the CC: Security Tower to drain with Despair, and we were each paying for drains as he never came to space.<br />
<br />
He had Yoda Mofo at the Theed Palace Hallway along with Panaka so one turn I paid to drain, then dropped EPP Maul in front of those guys, but didn&#39;t battle. I had Maul Strikes and a Ghhhk in hand so I knew I was ok, I wanted him to initiate so that we could clear off and then I could use the No Escape which was also in my hand to get Maul back the next turn. Plus putting Maul there saved me some force loss to WHAP, since I couldn&#39;t find Decree v. So he went for it next turn, initiating battle against my lone Maul. We cleared off and I was perfectly happy. Except...I still couldn&#39;t find Decree...<br />
<br />
Third turn I had looked for Decree and it had been activated. Then when I searched with Flagship and shuffled my deck it got activated again. So finally I went to WMAOP for it but Rick Sensed my WMAOP (he had two Jedi out at the time). So it took me till like turn 7 or so to get Decree out, which meant I took a ton of WHAP damage.<br />
<br />
But once I got that card out the tides turned. Rick had set up at the Naboo Throne Room with Ep1 Obi-wan, Queen Amidala, and Sio Bibble, and at the Naboo Hallway with another Yoda Mofo/Pancake tandem. I had total ownage of the Bespin system but due to force constraints was unable to set up my Naboo system with a Star Destroyer at all this game (frown). I also had that random character (can&#39;t remember who, might have been the Gemme-peror) draining for 2 with Despair at the Security Tower, and then I deployed Grand Admiral Thrawn to the Carbonite Chamber and Dr. Evazan combo to the Audience Chamber with a Ghhhk in hand (I knew Qui-Gon was still available). So that&#39;s a total drain of 6 for free, while I occupy enough battlegrounds to reduce WHAP damage to one every time. Plus Rick played the goofy immediate effect that gives me drain +1 on the Audience Chamber, so Dr. E racked up the damage. I got Maul back onto Naboo for some more carnage, he dropped Qui-Gon to face off there, but nothing came of it. I was able to out-damage him enough to overcome my earlier deficit, and eke out the win.<br />
<br />

Recap: damn Decree was MIA like all friggin game, otherwise this one would not have been as close. Rick made few mistakes, the biggest of which being playing that stoopid immediate effect. He never came to space, which was smart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME FIVE<br />
my dark vs Pat Johnson&#39;s Hidden Base<br />
aka game 4 against a putzburgh local<br />
<br />
Well this sucks i gotta play pat....aGAIN<br />
This game was pretty dull, I got Lando out to the prison first turn so as to deny Pat his Gen Calrissian. Then he pulled a bonehead move and revealed Gold Squadron 1 to me with Squadron Assignments, so I made him go get Nien Nunb out of his deck. I started draining for 2 with Despair at the Security Tower, and got set up with the Executor in space. I pretty much dominated Pat&#39;s space fleet, and forced him into flipping pretty early. After that I hunted down his hidden base system and made him lose a bunch of force to Security Precautions. Then I drained him out. If we had any battles this game I don&#39;t even remember them<br />
<br />

Recap: I&#39;m just hopin I didn&#39;t knock Pat out of contention for one of the top spots<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME SIX<br />
my LS vs Ken Cross&#39; Huntdown<br />
<br />
He started Conduct Your Search, Blaster Rack v, and something else. But no dueling. We each started off pretty slowly, generating about the same amount of force. I started looking for Honor or my WWTBAO, and found one or the other pretty quickly, and Ken started losing to his own Visage while I did...nothing. He pulled the Back Door and I put Qui-Gon there to cause him more damage. He came down with Blizzard 4 (pulled Premiere Vader) and Grandma Tarkin, well I dropped virtual Leia and someone else to cancel Tarkin&#39;s gametext and clear that out.<br />
<br />
He spent like a turn or two searching for his No Escape, and it came out around turn 7 or 8. But by that time he had lost an irreparable amount of force to Visage and to my random drains.<br />
<br />
FW by 22<br />
Recap: well i guess the details on that game were pretty shady but it wasn&#39;t too exciting. i was getting real f&#39;in tired so i dont remember much of the game. the main thing i remember is that his own visage was truly the biggest thorn in his side that game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++WRAP-UP+++++++<br />
<br />
I was the only undefeated. Even though Pat Johnson had to play (and lose to) me twice, he finished in second place, having won all his other games with great differential (apparently there were no 5-1s). Ricky Ricardo edged out Matt Pietrangelo in differential to take third, so putzburgh took 1, 2, 3. As for Dan Tortellini.....well he went 2-3 with a bye =)<br />
<br />
