I had all these deck<br />
ideas to try out and play, because I was planning on staying with<br />
several guys from my Southern CA squad, so I could see what worked.<br />
Unfortunately, this is final exam time for me, so I ended up not<br />
touching my SW cards all week, and just went with decks I already<br />
had made.  I was driving down to Vegas from San Francisco with <br />
Clayton Atkin, Ohmy Fasudhani, and Alfred Dong, all of whom are in<br />
the top 10 in Alderaan so all of them have the skills to win the<br />
DPC.  The champs in the car talked a bunch of tech.  Mapquest told<br />
us it was a 11.5 hr drive, but we trimmed that down to 8.5 hours.<br />
I didn&#146;t have a chance to tweak or build decks because I was (&amp;<br />
still am) in final exams so I didn&#146;t get to do ANYTHING I wanted<br />
to do regarding SWCCG.<br />
<br />
Clayton went with his CCT skrillings odds deck which won him the<br />
CA championship and several other tournies.  He chose his killer<br />
TIGIH scouts for LS.  Ohmy used Klatooinian Revolutionaries AITC<br />
(a.k.a. the Vietcong deck).  It had gone 2-0 at the Vegas prelim,<br />
both wins against MKOS.  Those Revolutionaries are power 5 at JP<br />
sites!  You can really swarm with them.  For dark, he chose MKOS<br />
skrillings.  Alfred used MKOS skrillings and TIGIH scouts.  I<br />
played a little against my friends from So Cal, and we invited the<br />
Northern CA guys to stay with us, but they decided to get their<br />
own room since it was a bit crowded.  I had 2 decks to choose<br />
from.  Hunt Down w/unique TIEs, or Court Scum.  I chose Hunt Down<br />
because I felt it had the better chance against WYS decks.  For<br />
light I had a HB mains deck and EBOX, and the EBOX did waaaaay<br />
better in my playtesting so EBOX it was.  I changed a couple cards<br />
because I had done horribly in the prelim on Friday, but mainly<br />
chalked it up to game mistakes in my part, not the deck.<br />
<br />
So we wake up, and head on out to the 2nd ever DPC.  Fill out the<br />
decklist, pay the entry fee, and prepare to play 8 games without<br />
any breaks.  Good thing I brought some food with me.  72 people I<br />
heard showed up.<br />
<br />
Game 1: LS v Bryan Nakamuya&#146;s Endor Ops (from San Diego area)<br />
<br />
I&#146;ve been to San Diego, but I never met Bryan.  He does the Op As<br />
Planned start to get Desperate Counter and his DSII stuff.  I start<br />
ANSB.  It was a funny game.  He didn&#146;t want to deploy systems for<br />
me to drain at, and I didn&#146;t want to deploy systems for him to move<br />
the DSII to.  So once EBO got setup, I deployed to Endor &amp; we <br />
battle there all game long.  He keeps some ships at the DSII so if<br />
I move over he can battle them and kill them.  I don&#146;t worry about<br />
blowing it away, its not hurting me anyway.  I am draining at his <br />
Endor DB with my Rogue 2 and at the North Ridge with Rogue 3, <br />
both with pilots aboard and Bacta Tank out.  He apparantly only<br />
has EPP Vader as a ground troop, who is in the bunker with Jejerrod.<br />
So the game takes a long time, neither of us can beat the other off<br />
of Endor, and my measly drains on the ground do him in.  Win by<br />
18.  2 (+18).<br />
<br />
Best: Good fights in space, my Org Attacks saved me from losing<br />
many xwings.  We would often tie on power and both be immune to<br />
attrition (he had Star Destroyers with the Order out which protects<br />
them).<br />
Worst: Maybe I should have deployed more systems, but I had never<br />
faced this deck before and didn&#146;t know what to expect.  I would<br />
have been losing to the DSII though had I deployed a system.<br />
<br />
Game 2: DS v Casey Barson&#146;s WYS (from Utah)<br />
<br />
For those of you who read my TR from the prelim in Vegas, this is <br />
the same guy from that tourney.  I figure he&#146;s playing the one-<br />
battle-and-its-game-over card, so I watch how I deploy.  DLOTS<br />
hits Tat DB 1st turn, while he deploys Home One DB and draws.<br />
BTW, I start IAO, Mob Pts, and Combat Response.  Emperor goes to<br />
my Endor DB, and I drop Endor and Kashyyk.  Baron in Saber 1 w/<br />
cannon goes to Endor.  He deploys a &lt;&gt; DB with Lando w/gun.<br />
Then EPP Han goes to the Cantina to flip.  Emp moves to Tat DB,<br />
Vader moves to Han.  I deploy a couple TIEs to Kashyyk.  He drops<br />
a couple smugglers on Emp, but I draw a 6 and he draws low so I<br />
don&#146;t lose anything.  Then Han moves to Emp&#146;s site.  So I know<br />
the Emp will need backup, but I forget that I&#146;m setting myself<br />
up for the one-battle-and-its-game-over card and I move Vader<br />
over.  So EPP Luke goes to the Cantina, he battles and plays the<br />
bad feeling card, Run, Luke, Run, then Clashes Vader.  He then<br />
hits Emp and I lose a bunch of force to end the game.  I guess<br />
Casey&#146;s just got my number with those battle cards.  Lose by 25.<br />
2 (-7).<br />
<br />
Best: I had good drains going, I just couldn&#146;t deal with the <br />
clash of sabers.<br />
Worst: Problem was I couldn&#146;t do much else other than move Vader.<br />
He only had power 5 there, so I would&#146;ve had to leave Emp alone<br />
to prevent that card from being played.  And I figured DLOTS could<br />
do some chokin&#146;.  Oh well.......<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS v Simon Lee&#146;s Endor Ops (from Canada)<br />
<br />
Simon does the Op As Planned start to get Desperate Counter.  I<br />
start ANSB.  I get a good hand and decide to deploy my systems<br />
thsi time.  I spread my xwings out &amp; get in some good drains after<br />
EBO is setup.  He moves the DSII to do damage to me, but I deploy<br />
Honor to stop it for now.  Things are looking good for me since he<br />
keeps several of his ships at the DSII to stop me from moving there<br />
and blowing it away.  He&#146;s got a large fleet at Hoth (Guri &amp; Xizor<br />
in their ships, DSSD, and 2 TIEs w/guns), so i drop an xwing there<br />
with a claw to kill that drain.  So his drain is dead, &amp; his DSII<br />
damage is dead thanks to Honor.  However, he moves his fleet to a<br />
system where I have 2 xwings, so I run away, and he Gravity Shadows<br />
one of them.  Uh-oh.  I only have enough force left to move 2 xwings<br />
to help it out, so i do that and save 1 force.  He battles, I react<br />
w/Spiral and play Org Attack, but I still take quite a bit of damage<br />
thanks to his 3 destiny draws (Guri &amp; Xizor).  Something like 14<br />
overflow.  Then he moves his fleet around and shoots down my xwings<br />
with those TIEs that shoot during his move phase.  My drains dwindled<br />
&amp; he occupied his 3 BGs to satisfy Honor and the DSII started hurting<br />
me.  Lose by 8.  2 (-15).<br />
<br />
Best: I played well, he just got me with the Gravity Shadow.<br />
Worst: Were it not for the Gravity Shadow I easily would have won.<br />
<br />
Game 4: DS v Steve Marshall&#146;s Profit (from Arizona)<br />
<br />
I&#146;d seen Steve&#146;s name all over decktech before so its was cool to<br />
finally meet him.  I started Mara in the Chamber.  Emperor went to<br />
my Endor DB, and the next turn Lord Vader went to his Tatooine DB.<br />
He still hadn&#146;t deployed anyone, so I moved Mara w/saber out to JP<br />
and drew, and then twi&#146;leked for Secret Plans.  But he went and freed<br />
Han before I could deploy the Plans and retrieved his force.  Ben<br />
w/saber did the freeing of Han.  I&#146;ve got my space drains at Endor<br />
and Kashyyk so I leave Ben and Han alone.  He deploys a &lt;&gt; DB and <br />
Mara moves there so I can activate more (I wanted to deploy Executor<br />
next turn).  Then I realize he doesn&#146;t have much space power, so I<br />
don&#146;t deploy anymore in space.  He drops Boushh and Master Luke vs<br />
Lord Vader, Boushh has Ani&#146;s saber.  He battles, I consider dueling<br />
Luke, but even though he has no stick I don&#146;t feel confident enough.<br />
So Vader and Boushh die, and I deploy DLOTS to Luke&#146;s site.  Steve&#146;s<br />
got 1 card in hand, and 10 in his life force (I&#146;ve got 18 or so and <br />
a few in hand), but I don&#146;t duel.  I don&#146;t battle either, I decide<br />
to let the drains decide who will win.  He activates down to one, &amp;<br />
since I&#146;m a nice guy I say &quot;You sure you want to do that?&quot;  He<br />
decides to leave 3 in reserve.  :)<br />
<br />
So now I think he&#146;s got Courage in hand, and I just let the drains<br />
finish him off.  He&#146;s only draining me in the Chamber with Ben w/<br />
saber and Han in there.  So I win by 12.  And yes, he was holding<br />
Courage in hand (so I don&#146;t know why he&#146;d activate down to one if he<br />
had it in hand).  4 (-3).<br />
<br />
Best: Space drains were the difference in the game.<br />
Worst: Turns out he had the Courage outta the gate 1st turn.<br />
<br />
Several people are dropping throughout the tourney, but that is to<br />
be expected.  I&#146;m 2-2 as are many of my buddies, but one of my pals<br />
from So Cal (Dan Lujan) is 4-0 and is rolling, so that&#146;s cool.<br />
<br />
Game 5: LS v Caleb Smith&#146;s BHBM (from San Diego)<br />
<br />
I played Caleb once when I was in SD, and he beat me with the Super<br />
Falcon (damn Legendary Starfighter hit me all game).  I figured my<br />
EBO could win here.  I started ANSB.  He gets Emp and Janus to DSII<br />
DB 1st turn, I get my EBO stuff.  Then Vader hits the Endor DB, and<br />
I deploy Hoth Luke to the North Ridge, saving 2 force.  He just <br />
draws, and I move Luke under the shield, and setup EBO.  I lose to<br />
Your Destiny (even though he had already activated), and I drop an<br />
xwing at Kiffex and Hoth, with 2 barriers and Hyper Escape in hand.<br />
However, he drops 4 Dreadnaughts at Kiffex (and like an idiot I <br />
barrier BOTH of them, leaving me no force to hyper escape away!),<br />
then Zuckuss in Mist Hunter comes down to totally wreck that poor<br />
xwing.  I take like 15 in overflow.  That&#146;s because he had his <br />
destiny tracked and used Emp&#146;s Power to draw 2 7&#146;s.  Jeez, I am <br />
playing dumb, I should&#146;ve remembered I could&#146;ve Hyper Esacaped away.  <br />
Well, he had the lock in space now with 4 dreads and Zuckuss, and I<br />
lost my claw to a drain.  So I moved Luke to Endor DB, and that was<br />
the only damage he would take all game.  Lose by 34.  4 (-37).<br />
<br />
Best: It was over quickly.<br />
Worst: Should&#146;ve only played 1 barrier.  Being 2-3 is not cool.<br />
<br />
Game 6: DS v Shane Watner&#146;s MWYHL test to 1 (from Vegas)<br />
<br />
Cool, the first guy I&#146;ve played from around here.  I talk with him<br />
a little to ask who the top players are and how the tourney scene is<br />
around here.  Then we get down to business.  I get SFS and Wakeelmui<br />
out 1st turn, but no Vader, so i draw and there he is.  Lord Vader<br />
to my Endor DB 2nd turn, he inserts AFA and draws.  It pops, I lose<br />
4, and I notice he loses Uncontrollable Fury.  I thank God because I<br />
only play ONE Lord Vader and I got him 2nd turn!  If I had drawn any<br />
other Vader that would&#146;ve really stunk.  That&#146;s because he got Yoda <br />
to his Hut so I&#146;d have been losing 2 force per turn.  Anyway, I get<br />
my space drains setup with Chirneau in Vader&#146;s TIE and the Dominator<br />
at Kashyyk and the Executor w/Piett at Endor.  Super Falcon goes to<br />
Kashyyyk, so I drop Emp&#146;s Sword and then battle, then play Imperial<br />
Command, which he grabs.  I draw high, and he loses Han and Leia,<br />
leaving the Falcon empty.  A couple more AFAs are inserted (its the<br />
only damage being done to me), until he drops EPP Obi and Tawss vs<br />
Lord Vader and a couple pilots and landed TIEs at the Endor DB.  He<br />
clashes Vader, and drops OTE and I forfeit a few TIEs.  Then I deploy<br />
more pilots and TIEs (retrieving some), and I tracked a 6 so I know<br />
I&#146;ll kill Obi (Tawss is only forfeit 3).  So I kill him, and now its<br />
just Vader and TAwss at the DB.<br />
<br />
My drains are hurting him (he never bothered to complete Test 1) but<br />
I decide to keep Chirneau on the TIE even though he doesn&#146;t add to <br />
drains because I was afraid he&#146;d get Han and Leia on the Falcon again,<br />
and I needed all the power I could get.  So Vader finishes off Tawss<br />
once he&#146;s unclashed and I drain Shane out for the win by 18.  6 (-19).<br />
<br />
Best: Taking down the Super Falcon and getting Lord Vader out.<br />
Worst: I lost to AFA 4 times!  16 force right there.<br />
<br />
Game 7: LS v Brian Choorgphol&#146;s TDIGWATT (from Arizona)<br />
<br />
Well, I&#146;m 3-3 and hoping to finish 2-0.  I start ANSB and get a good<br />
hand with Wedge, RSL and a couple Rogue speeders.  So when he puts<br />
Lord Vader w/saber at a CC site, I immeditaely drop Wedge and Hobbie<br />
and kill Vader, while cancelling his destiny.  That also cancelled<br />
Search &amp; Destroy since he had Dengar w/gun and Mara at the other CC<br />
site.  Turns out he wasn&#146;t playing DD, just CC Occupation with <br />
unique TIEs (like my dark deck).  So I setup EBO and spread out my<br />
xwings to drain.  He keeps looking for matching pilots but they&#146;re<br />
never there.  He finally gets DS-181-3 in Saber 3 to Bespin but I<br />
deploy the Spiral and shuttle up Wedge &amp; Hobbie in Rogue 3.  He<br />
doesn&#146;t back up Saber 3, so I battle him and clear him from Bespin.<br />
Then I shuttle Rogue 3 back down and transit Rogue 1 w/Luke &amp; Zev<br />
over to the CC DB (only 2 CC sites on table).  He&#146;s looking for <br />
somewhere to drain, so he drops Emp to the North Ridge.  I Ice Storm<br />
and now he has nowhere to go that I don&#146;t already occupy.  I guess<br />
he couldn&#146;t draw the ships to take out my xwings (I had Hyper Escapes<br />
and Barriers anyways).  Win by 27.  8 (+8).<br />
<br />
Best: Deck worked great, if he hadn&#146;t kept on activating all his<br />
pilots it might have been a better game, but I&#146;ll take the win.<br />
Worst: None, really, except we didn&#146;t get to battle much.<br />
<br />
Game 8: DS v Matt Riecks&#146; WYS<br />
<br />
I either forgot to ask where Matt was from, or I can&#146;t remember.  I<br />
was hoping to win so I&#146;d be 5-3, but at least I was guaranteed to go<br />
4-4.  Lord Vader goes to my Endor DB, transits to Tat DB 1st turn.<br />
He draws some.  Emperor goes to Endor DB, and he deploys an RFC and<br />
Palace Raider in Patrol Craft to his &lt;&gt; DB.  I deploy Vader&#146;s saber<br />
then drop the Dominator and Saber 1 w/Fel to Tatooine.  I deploy my<br />
Admirals&#146; Order Fighters Coming In and Sullust.  He drops Outrider<br />
w/Dash, and Captain Han aboard the Falcon.  He battles, I react<br />
with Saber 4 w/pilot for free, and pay 5 to react Onix 2 w/pilot.<br />
I draw horribly and lose Saber 4 and pilot.  He loses Han.  I move<br />
over to Sullust.  He deploys Tat Celebration and moves the Falcon,<br />
with a claw, to Sullust.  Then he attaches.  I deploy Chirneau, &amp;<br />
he Noble Sac&#146;s Wedge to retrieve 10 force (Insurrection on table).<br />
<br />
So I have measly drains of 1 at endor DB and 2 at Tat DB, so I move<br />
Vader to Cantina.  Jedi Luke w/saber comes down, Weapon Lev&#146;s Vader&#146;s<br />
stick and I lose Vader and a couple.  Now I&#146;m in REAL trouble, only<br />
draining at Endor DB and being unable to deploy my EPP Vader in hand.<br />
I look for another Vader, and find DLOTS, and time is winding down.<br />
I move back to Tatooine from Sullust, the Falcon detaches (only <br />
Melas is aboard).  I had left Saber 1 at Sullust.  I&#146;ve got Dominator<br />
and Saber 2 w/pilot, plus Piett and Chirneau aboard Dominator.  I use<br />
my imperial Commands to limit his draws and he&#146;s starting to lose<br />
guys at Tatooine.  However, he&#146;s retrieving w/Celebration &amp; DLOTS<br />
can&#146;t do much when he keeps his smugglers in Patrol Craft, so DLOTS<br />
is basically just blocking a drain.  I have 12 cards left when time<br />
is called.  Matt has 21.  Timed loss by 21.  8 (-13).<br />
<br />
Best: Definetely the best game I had played all day.  Matt is a fun<br />
player.<br />
Worst: My destiny failed me in this game.  I drew horribly.<br />
<br />
Yay!  Its over!  8 games, and I made it through going 4-4.  Not that<br />
great, especially being in negative diffential, but it was my first<br />
major tournament ever.  I&#146;d never been to states, regionals, worlds,<br />
comic con, gencon, and all those.  But this DPC was cool, very fun.<br />
Lots of good competition, I&#146;ll have to be more ready next time, and <br />
not worry so much about finals, huh?  :)<br />
I finish at 8 (-13), good enough for 29th place out of 72.<br />
<br />
So the final standings:<br />
Jon Chu 14 +129<br />
Kyle Craft 13 +138<br />
Chris Shaner 12 +107<br />
Brian Hunter 12 +95<br />
Jason Kilby<br />
Arian Delisle<br />
Tim Guzman<br />
Paul Feldman<br />
Ted Hanson<br />
Caleb Smith<br />
<br />
Jon plays his Y4 Throne Room mains v Hunter&#146;s Big Blue ISB and Brain<br />
takes that match.  Kyle plays his Black Sun deck v Chris&#146;s TIGIH<br />
w/scouts.  Kyle gets a terrible hand and activates his Coruscant DB.<br />
With no characters, he decides to deploy Jodo v Jedi Luke, plays<br />
Hidden Weapons and draws 1, so he loses some force there.  But even<br />
if he had captured Luke, I didn&#146;t get it cuz he&#146;d lose 2 force to<br />
I Can Save Him and Chris had a EPP Obi anyway to get Luke back from<br />
Jodo.  Kyle has Emp and Xizor together, but he splits them up to<br />
drain for more so Chris Drops Gen Solo, COK, and EPP Obi and rips<br />
Xizor a new one.  That&#146;s game.<br />
<br />
Hunter beat Shaner in both matches and wins the jackpot of $700 (I<br />
think they decided before the match they would split the money $700<br />
and $500 rather than $1000 and $200).  Hunter&#146;s space drains with his<br />
ISB deck were the difference in the game because Hunter had u/c spies<br />
blocking Shaner&#146;s drains.  Shaner did get a good beating with his <br />
scouts, but not big enough.  Then, Hunter locked down Shaner&#146;s ISB<br />
Scum deck with Menace Fades and Battle Plan.  Hunter was draining at<br />
the CC DB and Tat DB and Corulag, while Shaner drained at JP, the<br />
Audience Chamber, and Lower Passages.  But he had to pay 3 for each<br />
drain of 1.  Hunter had Home One and Super Falcon at Corulag, so<br />
Shaner wasn&#146;t going to mess with that, which was the only BG system.<br />
Congrats to both of them for doing so well, I hope they didn&#146;t lose<br />
it all at the casinos.<br />
<br />
Well, Dan and i were the only ones from our squad who stuck around<br />
for the final, so we headed back to the hotel and passed out.  At<br />
7 AM the next morning I woke up and headed out with the Nor Cal<br />
squad back to SF.  I slept most of the way.  Thanks for reading,<br />
I&#146;ll keep the props short since this is long enough.<br />
<br />
Props to:<br />
Mike Girard for running the tourney smoothly &amp; relatively quickly.<br />
Mike Sinclair and Nathan M. for also running the DPC, good job.<br />
Everyone I played against, they were all fun games and I feel lucky<br />
to have met such nice players.<br />
Alfred for going 4-4 just like me.<br />
Clayton for doing much of the driving.<br />
Ohmy for also doing much of the driving.<br />
Everyone who read this and my prelim TR, and liked them.<br />
To all those who had a longer drive than we did (530 miles) and<br />
still made the journey to Vegas.<br />
To all who placed in the top ten, good job to all them.<br />
<br />
Slops to:<br />
Dan Lujan, for going 5-0, then 0-3.  I was counting on you to go all<br />
the way man!<br />
Adam, Chris, Andre, Ohmy, and others for all dropping out of the<br />
tourney.  I know you were all tired, bored, hungry, sad, whatever,<br />
but you still should&#146;ve stayed, if only to keep me company.  :)<br />
Mike Girard for not calling my number on one of the tournament foil<br />
raffles.  It was rigged I tell ya!<br />
My school for having final exams at during this time. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=2226&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
