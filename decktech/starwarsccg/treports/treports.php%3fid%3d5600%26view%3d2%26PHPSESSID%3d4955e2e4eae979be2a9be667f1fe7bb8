<br />
I don&#8217;t usually write TR&#8217;s but since I did pretty well and I actually remember some details from the games and I have some free time I decided to write one up.<br />
<br />
Pre-tourney stuff:  I&#8217;ve been playing online a bunch and had pretty much decided I was definitley going to play TRM for light, but had no idea for dark.  I considered EOPS, ROPS, AoBS, IG, and HD.  On Thursday night before the tourney I email myself my deck files for all the decks and then head home from my dorm to physically make the decks.  Well when I get home the internet isn&#8217;t working so I have to do everything from memory, which is ok since I basically know everything card for card but makes it harder.  It ends up taking longer than I expected and as I still have homework to do that night I end up heading back to my dorm with only HD, AoBS, and TRM built.  After class on Friday I head down to Pistone&#8217;s apartment and we leave there at about 7.  Drive is pretty uneventful except that we randomly run into Eric Hunter on the GW bridge which was really weird.  We get ino Aberdeen MD at like 11:30, and want to go to the Taco Bell that&#8217;s right next to the hotel, but some random mexican guy is screaming at the people in the drive through so we decide not to get shot and go to Applebees instead.  Applebees gives Mike a knife that has all this green crap all over it which is pretty damn nasty even though Mike didn&#8217;t need to use his knife.  We head back and test a bit and I don&#8217;t feel like playing AoBS as lots of people play I don&#8217;t need there scum either v which basically kills all the decks tricks.  So I play Huntdown which turns out to be a good choice.  Next day we get up and are gonna get something to eat but Elia calls us at 11 and says that everyone is there and they are starting, so we rush down there instead of eating.  When we get there we see Reid and Meeker in their car filling out decklists and Elia is at Wendys getting food.  So we actually start at like noon like we assumed and could have gotten food.  On to the games.<br />
<br />
Game 1: TRM vs Schwartz&#8217;s Watto (sorry I forgot your first name)<br />
I start scrambled v, insurection combo, and quick draw v.  Threepio comes out early and I build up twixes / a hand for a couple turns.  He does his watto thing, makes me lose a couple force, plays some scrubs, etc.  I drop obi v and saber down to his mos espa on like turn 3-4.  At some point pretty early I get tantive v and bright hope v to tatooine draining.  He comes down with epp vader and tries to use maul with his obj but since I can look at it with scrambled I&#8217;m obviously not going to let him deploy free.  He doesn&#8217;t battle just moves over epp 4lom from watto site and says go.  In my control phase he disarms obi.  I add jedi luke with saber and battle.  Swing at 4lom so I can clear the site for sure.  I draw a 0 and 3.  So I miss, but it&#8217;s ok, I just need to draw a 4 to kill vader.  He cancels obis text then misses luke with vader.  We draw battle destiny and I get&#8230; a 0.  Those were the only 2 0s left in the deck of about 30 cards.  So I lose obi and he loses a couple force to keep everyone alive.  Next turn he adds sidious to the site and battles, end result luke vader and 4lom die.  I deploy the 3/2 naboo site and drop obi v with saber there and optimism v on him targeting sidious.  He tries to attack with epp maul but obi v is good so maul dies and obi lives.  Later he comes to space with dengar but as I had already seen mist hunter and maul&#8217;s ship go to the lost I know he doesn&#8217;t have much so I split my ships with a pilot on each and move to endor where dengar is with bright hope / lando scoundrel and leave tantive / padme at tatooine draining, all backed by savrip in case he drops baron or something.  He fights bright hope / lando and draws a tracked 5, I win the battle so no savrip, the system clears thanks to punishing one v.  Soon after this my drains of 3 and 4 finish him off.  FW +20<br />
<br />
2 (+20)<br />
<br />
Game 2:  Hunt Down vs Scott Lingrell&#8217;s AITC Obi v8 start spaceport speeders beatdown deck<br />
My turn 1 I just drop the bridge maybe and draw a couple.  His turn 1 he gets lars farm and draws.  My turn 2 I drop epp maul, phantom menace, battle, hit obi, obi misses maul, crossfire oop, draw 2 destiny to his 1, obi and 7 go off the top.  Maul then moves over to the farm.  His turn he can&#8217;t find mos eisley so just draws.  I drain and drop b4 / vader to mauls site and say go.  His turn he plays mos eiesly, droid, sells it, activates some, tunnels, drops epp luke, leia, owen beru, and kiadi mundi.  He battles, plays skywalkers and harvets to add 4 bd.  I play I have you now to add two destiny, hit kiadi and luke I think, choke the lars family.  I don&#8217;t think he hit anyone.  He draws like 19 in destiny so I lose all my guys but no overflow.  He loses everyone I think.  Vader comes down again next turn and gets backed up later, but his deck is basically done at this point so I drain / visage him out.  FW +32<br />
<br />
4 (+52) (+$25 for beating Scott :)&#61514;)<br />
<br />
Game 3:  TRM vs Pat Johnson&#8217;s Watto<br />
I start the same as in the last game, no twixes in opening hand but a lot of characters, so I draw to get some activation.  I take a few turns setting up activation again and he sets up watto like normal, making me lose some.  I take over mos espa with mace (no saber) and jedi luke with saber, but he plays luke luke v on lando at watto site so I can&#8217;t drain.  I then make the mistake of moving luke and mace over to the junkyard thinking that they would die but be able to take out watto and get rid of luke luke at least, and they would be able to cover the battle damage.  He drops epp maul, hits both guys, I hit watto, but I lose like 8 overflow.  I can&#8217;t find my 3/2 site and he quickly redeploys watto and plays vader and maybe b4 to lock down mos espa, and puts two star destroyers and a cannon at the system, so he drains me out soon after.  FL -17<br />
<br />
4 (+35)<br />
<br />
Game 4:  Hunt Down vs Greg Shaw&#8217;s TIGIH with his v card<br />
First turn I just play the back door and draw.  Shaw plays I&#8217;m with you too v on luke and moves him to back door.  Turn 2 vader / b4 come down to the back door and takes luke.  At some point early Shaw loses obi and poops him with merc and plays his v card.  The rest of this game I just stack up guys at the back door, playing saber / presence / janus to add to the drain.  He tries to fight with epp qui a couple times but can&#8217;t hit vader and I had too many people at the site to do anything to me.  Leia rebel princess comes down to the hut to cancel some of my drains and I&#8217;m holding elis but can&#8217;t beat her down since I vader has a captive so he can&#8217;t go, emperor can&#8217;t go, and b4 can&#8217;t go, and janus isn&#8217;t a good beatdown crew.  I do drop epp mara and dre and 4lom with gun on her at one point and do a couple overflow.  Then I just drain him out, which takes a while because of merc v but he really can&#8217;t touch the back door so there isn&#8217;t much he can do.  FW +25<br />
<br />
6 (+60)<br />
<br />
Game 5:  Hunt Down vs Reid Smith&#8217;s TIGIH with Shaw&#8217;s v card<br />
Hmmm looks familiar.  Turn 1 I drop Janus to the db and don&#8217;t play back door so he only activates 2.  I save 1 and say go.  His turn he plays a non bg db and play&#39;s i&#39;m with you too v on luke, moves luke over to janus and maybe draws or just ends.  I play b4 and get choke vader to take luke and end.  He does some more nothing and then ends.  I play back door and move the crew over to their.  He still doesn&#8217;t really do anything (he&#8217;s not getting much force) except maybe play a twix or something.  I add some more guys to the back door and drain.  This goes on for a while until he has to do something so he drops mace  and saber to the db to drain.  I luke luke that and say go.  He plays kiadi v and saber and moves mace over to join him and cancel luke luke.  He dropped corran to cancel visage at some point too but I ignore him since he can&#8217;t drain due to coward and I don&#8217;t want to let him cancel my bd and win a battle.  I your powers are weak old man mace&#8217;s saber and play sidious to the non corran executor site.  Battle his kiadi v and mace v with janus, b4, choke vader, mara, and crazy fett.  Mara hits kiadi v and snipers him to lost, don&#8217;t poop him since I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s playing more than one.  He adds 5 to power and smoke screens, so he ends up having to lose only 1, I lose mara I think.  I poop mace with sidious.  From there I drain him out.  FW +27<br />
<br />
8 (+87)<br />
<br />
Game 6:  TRM vs Reid Smith&#8217;s Naboo Tanks<br />
I Start insurection combo, quick draw v, and civil v.  Turn 1 I play threepio and 2 twixes and draw.  He started decree so he activates a bunch and drops stinger v and guri to naboo and draws.  My turn I just draw looking for kessel or the 3/2 site as I don&#8217;t want to be outisde where his tanks can beat me up.  He adds zuckuss v / mist hunter v and bossk v / hound&#8217;s tooth v to the system.  My turn I see that both kessel and the 3/2 are definitley in my force pile so I just draw.  After a couple I get the 3/2, and I should have stopped drawing.  But as I had HCF, Bright Hope v and Tantive v in hand I wanted kessel too.  So I kept drawing and kessel was at like the bottom of my huge force pile.  So I had like 25 or so cards in hand (not an exageration at all).  Reid deploys a tank or something then draws, then plays monnok lost.  I lose 2x Obi v, 2x Mace v, 2x Epp Qui, 2x Jedi Luke, 2x Resilience, and 2x Grabber (I should have grabbed it to save the other grabber but didn&#8217;t think of it till I lost them).  So that&#8217;s basically game.  I play in space and kill some ships and stuff for a while but I can&#8217;t do anything so he wins.  FL -19<br />
<br />
8 (+68)<br />
<br />
The final four are Pat Johnson, Reid Smith, Me, and Drew Scott.  Pat Johnson and Drew Scott automatically get the byes as Reid and I both already had one, so we are just playing for the money / glass.  We are playing 1 game semi-finals with top player choosing side and then a match play final.  This is bad for me as Reid will obviously choose to play dark and I will have a tough time beating that deck.<br />
<br />
Game 7:  TRM vs Reid Smith&#8217;s tank deck.<br />
I opt to start the 3/2 site instead of the throne room this game so I can start draining fast.  He gets stinger out to naboo turn 1 again.  I get jedi luke with stick to the 3/2 turn 1 or 2 to start draining, then draw for space.  He fortifies space with zuckuss and maybe bossk or dengar.  He drops a tank to the plains and I optimism that guy.  I keep drawing for space, and get it so I play kessel and put tantive, bright hope, and lando scoundrel to rpoint (bright hope is barriered so just tantive and lando go to kessel).  I play savrip too.  He plays a couple more tanks and puts luke luke v on woof targeting jedi luke and then moves wooof into an aat assault leader at the plains, with the optimismed tank moving to the db.  I drain at kessel and then try to alter luke luke but I draw a jedi luke so that sucks.  Next turn I track around the 6 and the 4 so I can hit the aat leader.  I play mace and saber to the plains and battle.  Then for some reason I second guess my tracking so I threepio and it&#8217;s the alter that I had tracked correctly to the top.  I could still hit the guy if I draw a 4 or higher for the 2nd destiny which I have a lot of in the deck.  I draw the 6 and a 3 so I miss the tank since it&#8217;s armor 5.  He then plays masterful on my savrip.  I sense, he alters, I sense, he alters.  Savrip is cancelled.  He draws 4 destiny and overflows mace for 20, so I conceed.<br />
<br />
Pat Johnson elected to play his WHAP vs Drew Scott&#8217;s Hunt Down, and Drew managed to win it by 1.  Drew and Reid then split the money with Reid getting the win.<br />
<br />
Final Results:<br />
1st:  Reid Smith (TIGIH / Naboo tanks)<br />
2nd:  Drew Scott (Weird mains deck with iitfys (v) start / Hunt Down)<br />
3rd / 4th:  Pat Johnson and I. (WHAP / Watto and TRM / Huntdown)<br />
5th:  Nate Meeker (LSC / Naboo tanks)<br />
6th:  Michael Pistone (TRM / Huntdown)<br />
That&#8217;s all I know for standings.  Overall i&#8217;m pretty happy with my finish considering the strong field and had a good time playing cards and seeing everyone again.<br />
