<br />
Origins was simply incredible. I&#146;m thinking this report is gonna be HUGE because of all the crazy @#$% that happened, but there&#146;s so much out there that I CAN&#146;T put in the report like the Pepsi machine and other stuff. Hayes and Berta know what I&#146;m talking about.<br />
<br />
Whatever. On to the report. I wasn&#146;t even going to go to Origins in the first place, but I hop on mIRC, and Alex Tennet asks if I&#146;m going to Origins, and I say no, it&#146;s far away and stuff, but I tell him if HE goes, then I&#146;ll go. He tells me to get a ticket cuz he&#146;ll be there, and I&#146;m like, crap, now I gotta buy a ticket! So I buy a ticket, and pre-register online and I&#146;m good to go. Thursday morning I wake up and head down to the Austin airport. Few hours later, and I&#146;m in Columbus, baby! Hayes told me he&#146;s got me hooked up with a ride, so after I land I head out to the passenger pick-up area, and about 10 minutes later I see Hayes&#146; too-tall @#$% cramped up in the Twiggmobile (a blue Hyundai of some sort...Elantra?) along with Brian Fred. I throw my bag in the back, hop in, say what&#146;s up to Hayes and Brian Fred who I haven&#146;t seen since Worlds &#146;98? &#146;99? and we&#146;re off to the Convention Center. When we get there, the parking lot attendant cracks a few jokes about how the Twiggmobile obviously can&#146;t be Hayes&#146; car because of the way he&#146;s cramped up in it, but Hayes takes it in stride and we park and head in. <br />
<br />
We head up to the room(I&#146;m staying in 1022 in the Hyatt with Hayes, Brad Reinhold, Kyle Craft, and assorted others), I drop my luggage off, and we head down to the game area. Brian Fred is trying to show me around everywhere, but like a little kid I run off on my own and totally disappear on him. I go by the Decipher booth, talk to Kendrick who I haven&#146;t seen since before Korea, and then head over to the Crowne Royal hotel to meet up with the mIRC group. I get there, and meet people for the first time like Alex Tennet, Mike Dalton, Kim Caton, and Doug Faust. Heidi Farinholt&#146;s there too, but I had met her before at a tourney in Virginia I went to right before I went to Korea. Dalton and Gabe Alonso are playing a game of LOTR, which is like completely @#$%ing boring for me, cuz I don&#146;t play, but they eventually get done and we all head out to get something to eat. <br />
<br />
We wander down to the bar, decide to head outside of the hotel to find a restaurant, and walk like 2 miles around Columbus trying to find a goddamn restaurant that&#146;s open. According to Kim, who&#146;s been to Origins before, Columbus restaurants shut down at like 5 PM because NOBODY lives downtown, so there&#146;s no point to them staying open. She&#146;s right, we don&#146;t find @#$%, so we give up and head back to the hotel. Dalton almost cracks his head open walking along the sidewalk when he walks right into a sign he didn&#146;t see because he was staring at Heidi&#146;s @#$% too hard, but he&#146;s okay for the most part. We hit the food court, get something to eat, and then head off to the bar. Since we can&#146;t find a liquor store to buy some cases at, we decide to bring our cards down to the bar and play there instead of in the room. So we get drinks, and play a few games. Heidi, for some silly reason, thinks she can hang with me drink for drink, and tries to prove it. We cut her off before she gets TOO plastered, but by this point I&#146;m kinda messed up a bit myself, so they head back to the room, except for Alex, and I end up walking around all over the place with Alex for some reason. <br />
<br />
We find this office building with a door open, and for some reason go inside. It&#146;s like dark and stuff, but we find this water fountain pool thing with the coins on the bottom and for some reason I think it&#146;d be a great idea to take my sandals off and walk in the pool. So I roll my jeans up a bit, lose my sandals, Alex follows my lead, so we&#146;re just like walking in the pool when this security guard rent-a-cop dude comes running up to us asking how the hell we got in here. At this point I realize A. I&#146;m pretty @#$%ed up and B. We really shouldn&#146;t be here. So I&#146;m like, &quot;Sorry dude, don&#146;t arrest us, we&#146;re leaving now, lemme get my sandals...&quot;, so I put my sandals back on and we leave. I&#146;m not sure why Alex is putting up with me, as I&#146;m pretty sure he&#146;s dead sober, I think he was just trying to make sure I didn&#146;t get too crazy or something. So then after walking around a parking garage for like an hour or so, cuz I&#146;m completely lost, Alex finally drags me up to my room and drops me off. I crash out. And that&#146;s the first night. Thanks for looking out for me Alex. <br />
<br />
Friday, I wake up around noon, and Hayes is the only other person in there, crashed out on the other bed. I get up, shower, yell at Hayes to wake up, and then head out. I meet up with the mIRC group again as most of them are playing in the LOTR tourney, and I just kinda wander around and talk to people. The tournament ends, and everybody ends up at the bar again. Much drinking once again ensues, with me running up a disgustingly huge bar tab. Munchkin and I trade shirts for some reason, to the delight of the crowd, and Berta unfortunately gets photographic evidence of the transfer. Apparently I also played a game of Star Wars with Munchkin, with Heidi providing help for her as she doesn&#146;t play, and apparently I win. (For some reason, I don&#146;t recall this game whatsoever) Hayes, Berta, and I find out about this party on the 20th floor, and head up there. It&#146;s pretty cool, so I go back down to the bar and grab some other people. Head back up, and I end up playing some kind of dice game a bunch of other people, and I&#146;m like doing great at it apparently because I&#146;m constantly rolling 30&#146;s on a 30-sided die. At any rate, that gets boring after a while, it&#146;s getting late, so I head back to the room and go right to sleep. <br />
<br />
Saturday. Tourney day. I wake up, shower, grab my cards, and head down to the game room again. All kinds of people are there, so I meet Gemme, Desai, the Twiggs, Jim Li, all kinds of people. I meet up with Wes Brown who I haven&#146;t seen in FOREVER, like since he was in Houston, so that&#146;s cool too. Bojo&#146;s there, and he&#146;s got hair on his head! The last time I saw him, his head was totally shaved. Irregardless, it&#146;s good to see him again too. He hooked me up a long time ago with two JK Lukes for the Virginia Beach GS. I&#146;ve got a hangover from Hell, but I&#146;m ready to play. So....on to the games. I didn&#146;t take notes, so if I&#146;ve forgotten the names of some of my opponents, sorry. It was a long day. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game One: WYS vs. John Veasy&#146;s ISB<br />
<br />
I start out the usual, and get Luke to Tatooine fairly quick. He pulls out the Yavin and Hoth Docking Bays, and starts draining at the Hoth DB. I drop Projection, get Menace Fades in effect, but his ISB droid on Tatooine is screwing up my drains. He drops friggin&#146; TANKS with the droid Tank Commanders for insane desinies, but I hang on Tatooine and get him to run away to Hoth. I get Legendary Starfighter out, and plink away with a few drains at some non Tatooine locations, but it&#146;s a very slow game and it times out with me having no cards in my lost pile. Bleh. Details are shabby due to the hangover.<br />

<br />
Highs: Winning the first game.<br />
Lows: It&#146;s a @#$%ing timed win. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game Two: My Dark Lightsaber Combat vs. Greg Shaw&#146;s RST Racing<br />
<br />
This was an excellent game that came down to the wire. Greg hits me for six with the race, then blows up the Bunker as well for another 8. He also retrieves as he&#146;s occupying battlegrounds and can pay for it. He&#146;s dropping Obi w/ Stick against my Maul, and we have a few fights and duels. With 8 force left, I kick out Bossk in Bus to fulfill Battle Order, while he&#146;s dropped Home One. I end up losing Bossk, and don&#146;t have enough force to pay for Maul&#146;s draining on Naboo. Details are shabby due to the hangover.<br />

<br />
Highs: Huh?<br />
Lows: Crap. I thought I was back on track. This doesn&#146;t bode well for DPC Houston...<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: My WYS vs. Matthew W.&#146;s Senate<br />
<br />
Another long game...Matthew has literally almost his entire deck activated by the time he deployed something, so he&#146;s using Lott Dod to look throw 40 something cards on his control phases. Meanwhile, I&#146;ve set up everywhere. He finally drops Vader, Sidious, and Mara to one of my DB&#146;s and battles. I lose a Raider to the Bacta Tank. He moves over to the Cantina, hanging out there for a bit while he tries his luck in space. Not much progress there either, and even with Edcel out I&#146;m hanging on the ground. The game ends on time (AGAIN) with me having about 4 cards in my lost pile. Details are shabby due to...you get the point.<br />
<br />
TW by 26<br />
<br />
Highs: I won.<br />
Lows: It&#146;s another goddamned timed win. Equaling two losses for me so far. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4: Dark LSC vs. ???&#146;s (sorry dude I forget..) Light LSC<br />
<br />
Holy @#$%. Believe it or not, I actually haven&#146;t played this match-up. I&#146;m such a scrub. At any rate, he had WAY more 7&#146;s than I did, and he&#146;s winning the combats left and right. I&#146;m losing cards FAST, while he&#146;s hardly lost any. When I get really low on cards, I finally get two 7&#146;s back to back, and track those around and win about 5-6 combats in a row. Unfortunately, I&#146;m on my 3rd Maul, and I&#146;m out of sticks, and his Qui-Gon DOES have a stick. So HE finally gets two 7&#146;s back to back, and knocks me out by winning two combats, 15 to 14. Damn. <br />
<br />
Highs: Tracking the 7&#146;s and ALMOST making a comeback.<br />
Lows:  Me being a dumbass and never playing LSC vs. LSC...dammit Justin it&#146;s all your fault. You never wanna playtest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5: Dark LSC vs. Efridge Engelhardt&#146;s Yavin Throne Room <br />
<br />
He&#146;s playing Throne Room, so of course his first action is to get out the DDTA shield to screw up my Mob. Points. He then activates, drops the JCC and another twix. And Goo Nee Tay. Damn. That&#146;s a hell of a start. I activate, drop Kashyyyk and the Executor DB, and save up for Maul. His turn, he REVOLUTIONS my Kashyyyk!!! Revolution! I&#146;m dyin&#146; ovah heah...I can&#146;t believe it. At any rate, I of course don&#146;t have any Evaders, so I&#146;m hurting a bit. I get out the Bridge, but it&#146;s a waste of a card because it eventually gets Revo&#146;d. I&#146;ve got Maul down, and desperately avoiding the beatdown with Barriers and Stunning Leaders. He does get one beatdown off on Sidious, but I was ready for it and just Ghhked the damage. Draw Their Fire is killin&#146; me, as it&#146;s really difficult to save force being choked, but I manage to combat him enough to cause some damage. I also Sense EVERY Rebel Reinforcements he plays, which pretty much saves my ass. We have the occasional SAC war (not like they used to be, but still..), but Oppressive Enforcement lets me recycle my Bad Feeling into the used where it promptly comes out again a few turns later. More combats, and I finally drain him out. <br />
<br />
FW by 9?<br />
<br />
Highs: Having a FULL win for once!<br />
Lows: Having Revo played against me. That&#146;s just so wrong. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6: WYS vs. ???&#146;s (sorry dude I forget..) SYC w/ Victory&#146;s and Tractor Beams<br />
<br />
Since this is the last game, there&#146;s like an assload of people who have dropped, so I get matched up with one of the very low placed people. He tells me he picked up the game about 3 weeks ago. (Not like I wasn&#146;t in the Sea of Jizz before, but this is nuts...) He starts out, plays Imp Command, gets Thrawn, and drops a Victory-class with Thrawn and a Tractor Beam at Rendili. I get Luke and Dash out on their respective ships, and set up some Raiders on the ground. He drops a Victory class with some 2/2 pilots and a Tractor Beam to Tatooine and battles. At the end of the battle, he actually capures Dash. Hmmm. I drop Han, Chewie Highly Upset, and the Falcon, and battle, knocking out his two Victory classes. He captures the Falcon though using that one card that adds 4 to the total when you play it lost (I don&#146;t know the friggin&#146; name, cut me some slack here...Flawless Marksmanship or some crap like that?) Anyways, Legendary goes on Luke, and he&#146;s got one Victory left sitting there. I battle with Luke, and play Darklighter Spin to hit him for like 5 overflow. Meanwhile, I&#146;ve retrieved the Outrider and Dash by now, and pull out his Secret Plans shield for him. There&#146;s not much he can do at this point anyway. Thrawn comes over from Rendili illegally, since a Victory can&#146;t make it that far, but Luke hammers him too. Games ends with me having no lost pile. <br />
<br />
FW by 33.<br />
<br />
Highs: Having yet another FULL win.<br />
Lows: Having to play a new guy. I hate doing that. <br />
<br />
SO, after going 4-2, I&#146;ve got 6 +66 diff. (666! Eeeeeevil!!! Eeeeeeeeeevil!!!) I get an It Could Be Worse foil for prize support, since all the Qui&#146;s were already gone, and that&#146;s the Star Wars Open for me. Complete scrubness on my part. Damn. I play a pick-up game with James Booker since Hayes is off bull@#$%ting somewhere, and knock out his Executor on my second turn with Han and Chewie, Outrageously Offended on the Falcon. Things go downhill from there for him. I win, Hayes comes over, we find Berta, and we&#146;re off to get some dinner. <br />
<br />
We go to this really cool brewery place that they don&#146;t have ANYWHERE in Texas, and I give the waitress hell about there not being any of these places in Texas, as it&#146;s like a huge state and this restaurant would do awesome in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Hayes ALMOST gets a beer, but we couldn&#146;t mack the waitress enough, and she stands resolute, although she was like THIS close to hooking him up with a brew. She&#146;s like standing there agonizing over it...so close...ah well. Hayes shares a bit of Berta&#146;s and my Hefeweisens (awesome German beer and my favorite in the world), so it&#146;s all good. We finish there, and head back to the Hyatt bar, dropping by the room first. I&#146;ve really gotta piss, but Hayes has to take a dump, and runs into the bathroom before I can get there. I howl at him through the door about him being a rat bastard, as I wouldn&#146;t of been that long, and he&#146;s gonna prolly be on the can a good half-hour, but it&#146;s to no avail. I&#146;ve really got go now. So, I head out of the room and [offensive actions on Matt Lush&#146;s part censored] Berta sees me though, and starts laughing hysterically while he whips out his camera and gets MORE blackmail evidence against me. Hayes gets done and we head down to the bar. <br />
<br />
Once again, there&#146;s all sorts of madness going on, and I get REALLY torn up since it&#146;s my last night there. I really shouldn&#146;t of, as much more madness ensues of which I don&#146;t recall much of. I just went totally off the hook there, I guess I could blame it on Origins since it was my first time there and such an absolute blast, but I think next year I&#146;ll take it easy on the Killian&#146;s. <br />
<br />
I eventually get back to the room, crash out, and Hayes wakes me up in the morning and takes me to the airport which was like hugely cool of him since it&#146;s always a pain in the @#$% to get up that early at a convention. I catch my flight, and such ends my first trip, but certainly not my last, to Origins. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mad mad props:<br />
<br />
Hayes Hunter, a fantastic friend who made Origins great for me by raising Hell with me, picking me up from the airport, and taking me back. You&#146;re the man. <br />
Matt Berta, the third musketeer in our trio of troublemakers for making it out there and partying with Hayes and I. <br />
Mike Gemme, for winning the SW Open. Kashyyyk is regulating. <br />
<br />
Props:<br />
<br />
Alex Tennet, for keeping me from ending up in jail somewhere. That woulda sucked. It was great to finally meet you, mate. &quot;Shaft!&quot;<br />
Desai, for being cool, and having everyone autograph random limbs. I signed his left calf, I think. <br />
Charlie Herren, another great friend of mine, for making it out there and surviving Friday night. <br />
Kyle Craft, for being cool.  <br />
Heidi Farinholt, for making it out there and playing SW with me Thursday night, along with the support during the Open. It was great to see you again. I truly wish the best for you in everything. You deserve it so much. <br />
Munchkin, for having enough cojones to trade shirts with me in the middle of the bar. <br />
Brad Reinhold, for the pick up game at that one restaurant and hanging out. <br />
Andy McClure, for, well, being Andy I guess. Good to see you again.<br />
Kim Caton, for whipping my @#$% in a pick up game with her ISB and being lots of fun to talk to. Glad I met you. Wish I had gotten a scrabble game in. Ah well. There&#146;s always DecipherCon.<br />
Gabe Alonso, for being Gabe. See ya at the next one, bro. <br />
Everyone else in the mIRC group who I met and hung out with. You guys are fun. <br />
To anyone I missed and feel that they deserve props! Sorry, I&#146;m just really tired of typing by this point...<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Myself, for scrubbing out in the Open.<br />
Myself, for getting a bit TOO carried away with the brew and getting trashed like never before despite the fact it made for a hell of a show for everyone. I&#146;ll be a bit more reserved at DecipherCon. <br />
<br />
It&#146;s funny how great these conventions are. You see all these people who you&#146;re totally cool with, and it&#146;s like no worries. No concerns, no responsibilities, you just let yourself go completely. I did, at least. I&#146;ll remember Origins &#146;02 for quite a while, I&#146;m sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
There you have it. &quot;ORIGINS, BABY!!!!&quot; <br />
