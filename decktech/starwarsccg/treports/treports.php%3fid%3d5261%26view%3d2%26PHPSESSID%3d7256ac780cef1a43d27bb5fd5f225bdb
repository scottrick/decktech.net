I think a lot of people going to MV were going there with high expectations.  Having been to the summer Visions, I was very excited to go there again.  Unfortunately, I couldnt convince many people from my local area to go, but oh well, their loss.  There were tons of good prizes to be had, and lots of cool people to catch up with.<br />
<br />
Part 1 - Deck selections:<br />
<br />
I had been much impressed with a BHBM that I had been playing for awhile prior to the tournament.  Its modeled after Brad Reinholds design, (with a few special modifications of course), basically all ground beats, placing Palpatine OOP with Skull and using emperors power to win battles.<br />
<br />
I figured it would have a good chance against almost all ground decks out there....i had playtested against Spencer s_skywalker Balls and Raphiel Assielens (sp) MWYHL...and although I managed to squeak out wins, I saw that this could possibly be a brutal matchup.<br />
<br />
I was also sure to put in No Escape, being able to start Honor like that is just mean.<br />
<br />
And I really wasnt too sure about light, I had messed around with _mauls non-hyperdrive a bit, and altho it was a lot of fun, I wasnt convinced that itd be able to hold its own against decks like Hunt Down or crazy Scum.  So I went back to what I knew  <br />
<br />
WHAP.<br />
<br />
Yes, whap.  I hadnt really played it much since MD states about 6 or so months ago, but I knew I could do well with this.  At MD states, it had 2 losses (both to walker decks) so I knew if I wasnt an idiot, I had to tech for this.  I changed about 5 card slots or so, just for that special matchup.  (in case Ive never told you, I hate walkers  :)  ) <br />
<br />
So after talking to everyone in the lovely Harford county area (Id say we have 8-9) active players.....Im able to get one guy to come with me.  Well, thats a lot better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Part 2  Gettin there<br />
<br />
So early that Saturday morning, I get up head out to the store and buy out all the canned goods, and go pick up Jeff, and then were on our way.  We ended up seeing a lot more of Lancaster, PA then I had hoped...unfortunately MapQuest wasnt especially clear about finding route 30 from 272.  Thankfully we got good directions from a nice woman in an antique shop in downtown Lancaster (if you guys are in the area, and in the need of antiques, definitely go check it out, lol )<br />
<br />
So we get there about 20 minutes early, Jeff fills out decklists, and I check out who else is there.  Theres a big group from PA, as expected, and I see some other guys from MD have made it, which is cool.  Shaw and Kafer got there a little after I did, and I think we had 17 people all together, which aint that bad.  So......without further ado....lets GET IT ON!<br />
<br />
Part 3 - Everything else<br />
<br />
Round 1  My BHBM vs. Jeff Johnss WHAP<br />
<br />
Man, what is that SWCCG law?  Something about, no matter how far you travel to a tournament, you always play the person you travel with?  Well, it holds true yet again.  I start Krayt (v), Begin Landing your troops, and Ability x 3 (v) every game.  He starts Wokling (v), Uh-oh (v), and I think Saitorr (v).<br />
<br />
First turn I pull Palps and drop him in the Throne Room.  He would stay there all game long.  I Alter Secure Route (v) as soon as I see it, and drop the Naboo 3/2 site between the throne room and the hallway.  He starts to make treks from the courtyard towards the Throne Room.  Bubo has some fun, I think he ate the Queen once, and maybe Jerus Jannick?  Anyway, some bad stuff starts to happen when he eventually gets Qui-Gon, Jedi Master to the 3/2 site with his saber and LS Prof.  I rush with Maul w/stick, but come up short with the swing both times.  I dont think I ever got that Qui-Gon, and he drained me for 5 there I think twice.  I take an alternate strategy by dropping a spaceport docking bay to Naboo, so I can occupy 3 BGs and pull out Resistance.  That way, Im able to outdamage him and his drain is capped.  We battle a few more times, but the steady drains that Ive been hitting him with since turn 2 force him to lose key cards.  I eventually drain him out, altho this was a lot closer than it couldve been, that silly 3/2 site, hehe.<br />
<br />
FW 2 +17<br />
<br />
Props:  To Jeff, for playing WHAP, and for making the trip.  He also gets props for taking advantage of that 3/2 site and getting a drain of 5 on me, that hurts.  Getting an Alter right away was also really nice.<br />
<br />
Slops:  That drain of 5.<br />
<br />
Then its my turn to play Light, now against Drew Scott, that crazy guy who won MD states this year.  Drews cool  we went 1-1 against each other at States, he beat my whap (in an aforementioned walkers game, for more details see the TR) and I beat his WYS with my CCT at the time.<br />
<br />
Round 2  My WHAP vs. Drew Scotts BHBM<br />
<br />
Wow, a complete mirror image of the first game.  Come to find out, Drew is also playing Reinholds BHBM, altho no creatures, which benefits me a tad, I suppose you could say, hehe.  He also elects to drop Palpy to the throne room first turn.  Anticipating bad things happening to my Secure Route (v) I pull out both anti-SAC shields before putting it out.  In my hand I have a Panaka, an Amidala, and a We Dont Have Time For This, amongst other things.  Needless to say, we battle, and Palpy goes away, I believe I flipped here.  After that, he tries a different approach by putting Palps with Janus out at the courtyard.  I dont like being drained for 3, so I attack with Ref III Qui-Gon with his saber.  Unfortunately he force fields my swing, and Palpy lives that turn.  This was a really interactive game, lots of battling, which is always fun.  The 7 side of the WHAP objective turns out to be as huge as always tho, with canceling battle destinies and causing damage.  And thanks to Route (v) and Disorder (v), my characters and other cards just dont stay in the Lost Pile.  Maul w/saber came down with Dr. E combo at some point, I forget where and who he battled tho.  His characters do usually stay dead, however, and he eventually runs out.  <br />
<br />
FW +33   (4 +50  Total)<br />
<br />
Props:  To Drew for being a cool opponent as always.....and to WHAP for being so whappy.<br />
<br />
Slops:  None come to mind.<br />
<br />
Well, after 2 rounds, it looks like Im in first place!  Woo hoo, thats never happened before, and is pretty cool I guess.  Matchups are made, it looks like Ill be taking on everybodys favorite poker-fiend Kevin Elia in Round 3.<br />
<br />
Round 3  BHBM vs. Kevin Elias nonprofit<br />
<br />
(note  it should be mentioned that the top two seeds at MV 4.12 at this time were both sporting stylish gold and black UMBC jackets......just thought that was a critical detail that could not be omitted)<br />
<br />
Well, weve played this matchup twice before, I think, so I was feeling kinda good about this.  I would soon see, tho, that Kevin had made quite a few changes to this deck, and I wouldnt have much to feel good about after it was over.<br />
<br />
I do the usual set up in the DS II Throne Room first turn.  He puts out 3PO, and I think thats it for his first turn.  I get Vader out quickly, and he promptly gives me Luke.  Rise My Friend, gets Luke and Vader over to DS II, and I get to do some dueling, causing some damage at least.  When I try to drain on Tatooine, he puts out Boussh or Tamtel Skreej (v), blocking me quite well.  Bubo takes care of Boussh, altho he pOOps Seeking to get her back eventually.  While all of this silliness is going on he casually puts out Rendezvous Point and Kessel.  R2, BLD went on the Bright Hope (v), and now hes set up to abuse How Did We Get Into This Mess?  In retrospect I definitely shouldve grabbed that, at the time tho, I felt like if I had grabbed it he wouldve abused something else......oh well.  So he keeps cycling through his deck finding whatever cards he needs.  He eventually drops Obi w/stick and Quiggy w/stick to the Cloud City lower corridor to drain me for 2 on the ground, then 3 in space per turn.  By this time I have all of my characters pretty much committed to Tatooine, and my Elises are nowhere to be found.  I keep losing one to the obj, and another 5 to drains, (altho Resistance eventually came out I think) and before long I realize that my life is pretty darn low.  <br />
<br />
Ive also had trouble getting ships in hand, by the time I get the Executor I have exactly 15 life.  I use it all to put it in front of the Bright Hope (v) and Tantive IV (v), altho I dont have one to battle.  His turn he drops the Spiral, and battles, and even with me putting Palpy out of play for 18 power, he gets like a 6 or something and wins the battle.  The Executor doesnt stick around much longer.  Right before the end he frees Han to get some life back, and he drains me out.  <br />
<br />
FL (-19 maybe)<br />
<br />
Props:  To Kevin for playing an awesome game, to Bubo for eating Boussh.<br />
<br />
Slops:  To Elis for not coming to my aid.....oh, and never stacking a single card on Insignificant Rebellion was pretty lame.  Thems the breaks tho.<br />
<br />
By now Im somewhere around 4 (+31)<br />
<br />
As it so happens, the sides work out that Kevin and I get to play again.  This should be interesting.....<br />
<br />
Round 4  WHAP vs. Elias Walkers<br />
<br />
Well, time to see if all my walker hate pays off.<br />
<br />
I start Wokling (v), Uh-oh (v), and Insight for this matchup.  When we draw starting hands, I notice with a sinking feeling that there is no Amidala there, not a good sign.  Well, he goes first, and I get to use Thrown Back (v) a few times.  That turns out to be pretty huge, as it gets me a Padme.  :)   He eventually puts an Imperial Walker at the 5th marker, not sure if that was first turn or second...<br />
<br />
On my first turn, I set up I Hope Shes All Right while flipping.  He tried to Alter Secure Route (v).....but I grabbed it and then cancelled it with a C/TV.  I believe Yane was the first musician to come out, so I ensure that I start my retrieval right from the get-go.<br />
<br />
He puts out Lord Vader on the Imperial Walker, and fetches the cannons, at some point he also puts Zuckuss at Kashyyyk.  All this time, he keeps losing to I Hope Shes All Right, (which turns out to be huge, Id say he lost around 7-8 to that all game) and to my objective, meanwhile I keep retrieving 2 a turn with Uh-oh (v).  Panaka hits the table eventually, but by then Decree (v) is capping my obj damage at 2 anyway.  He blows the generator, and I start losing stuff. <br />
<br />
One slight blunder I made, was not getting Insight back to fetch Honor early on, that wouldve helped when he blew it, as he didnt drop No Escape until afterwards, oh well.<br />
A little hitch comes up one time when he goes to drain me for 2 at Kashyyyk.  I play It Could Be Worse, and he promptly cancels with Its Worse....and pays every force he has active to make it a drain of 11.  I point to my objective, saying I lose only 2 to all drains, and he is understandably irked.  <br />
<br />
I do feel a bit bad about that, but thats the reason why It Could Be Worse is crazy cool in WHAP.  Another hitch comes when he drops Tatooine Maul to the Naboo Throne Room.  As only Padme and Yane were there, that makes me flip back.  Obi was at the Courtyard, so he has to trek all the way over, taking 2 more turns, while he gets to drain me there for 2.  When Obi does get there, he elects to move Maul away, letting me flip once again.  By now both of our life counts are pretty low.  He only gets off one Garrison, I believe he had to use his first Garrison to pull a walker or something.  Right before the end, he moves maul back to the throne room, in an effort to stop the damage.<br />
<br />
We battle, maul gets hit, I cancel his destiny I think, and he has enough overflow to end it....I win by 8.<br />
<br />
FW 2 (+8)<br />
<br />
Props:  Again to Kevin, for playing a heck of a game.  Definitely didnt see the Tatooine Maul coming.  Props also go to I Hope Shes All Right for sure....and to Uh-oh (v) for letting whap attempt to keep up with all the crazy damage from walkers.<br />
<br />
Slops:  Not getting Honor out when it mattered, but I guess thats about it.<br />
<br />
Overrall at this point 6 (+39) or so.<br />
<br />
For round 5, Kevin gets to play Greg Shaw, who is undefeated, and I get to play Drew Scott again, opposite side of course.  I know I need to win this if I want a shot and winning the whole shebang.<br />
<br />
Round 5  BHBM vs. Drew Scotts MWYHL<br />
<br />
Well, like I said before, I had played this matchup before, so I thought I knew what to do here.  He gets out the Gimer Stick first turn, so no fun for Bubo.  He gives me Luke as soon as I drop Vader, and I again use Rise My Friend to start the dueling.  He puts a Projection on both Naboo sites, so I can effectively only drain for 1 per turn, not good.  We battle at the generator core a few times, and Sidious lets me put Quiggy out of play one time, that was pretty cool I guess.  But as he completes more and more Jedi Tests, it starts to look worse and worse for me.  He drops Uncontrollable Fury on Vader, which I have to eat every single turn.  Obi with stick keeps sending my guys to my Used Pile at the 3/2 site, or he uses the SATM combo to keep me from winning battles.  At the end of the game I had 2 cards stacked, one short of what I needed!  <br />
<br />
He eventually stacks the 6, then it starts to get ugly.  I dont really think I ever suffered overflow.....the battles kept ending in annoying ways.  Jedi Test 6 also come out, making me lose an additional 2 per turn.  <br />
<br />
One fun strategy Drew liked to do was to battle, wait to see if I used Tauntaun Skull, and if I did, hed do a suicide Edge to kill whoever was in the battle, keeping me from stacking the needed cards.  He ends it after retrieving almost is entire lost pile from Edges.<br />
<br />
FL (-22 + or -)<br />
<br />
Props:  To Drew for playing a solid game with a solid deck.  It was a lot of fun, even if I did get smacked around a bit.  There was one point where I deployed Dr. E Combo, and said something like He doesnt like you...  Then he would take the cue and say I dont like you either, Ive got the death sentence in 12 systems....<br />
Me:  Ill be careful.<br />
Drew:  Youll be dead!<br />
<br />
We did a bit more of the scene like that, which Im sure frightened the players around us, but it was still incredibly hilarious at the time.<br />
<br />
Slops:  To BHBM for just being a not good matchup for MYWHL.  And for MWYHL for having so many cheesy-but-good tricks.<br />
<br />
So right now Im at 6 (+17)<br />
<br />
I get knocked down the table a little ways......and its time for round 6.<br />
<br />
Round 6  WHAP vs. Joe Streleckiss Trooper Ral Ops<br />
<br />
I really had no clue what to expect for this game, since I hadnt played against Ral Ops in about 1.5-2 years or so.  He starts An Entire Legion of My Best Troops, Planetary Subjugation, and the Mob Points Combo I think.<br />
<br />
He pulls Wakeelmui right away, and now Im a bit confused.  I was thinking bombers, now with Wakeelmui, Im thinking crazy TIE swarm, so I have no clue what to expect.  <br />
<br />
He puts a Stormtrooper (v) with an Assault Rifle (v) at the Throne Room right away.  Panaka rushes him, but misses the shot ( he was armor 4), and since I didnt get a destiny, the trooper lives.  That stunk.  Now I decide to be a bit more conservative, and attack with an Amidala and I think an Obi.....clearing the site and allowing me to flip.  Uh-Oh (v) comes out, and I get the retrieval going with Musicians.  He drops Sienar on Wakeelmui, and a Presence of the Force on Raltiir, so he satisfies Battle Order (which was never out to my knowledge)  I alter the Presence, then deploy a Republic character, get the Alter back, and alter Sienar.<br />
<br />
Now there wasnt much for him to do.  He puts a few guys out on Raltiir, but I dont ever set foot off of Naboo.  He can drain me for 1 or 2 on Raltiir, but Im retrieving 2 a turn and causing damage of 4 or 5 a turn (my drains are -1).  He Firepowers (v) Vader over once I think, but either Obi or Quiggy gets rid of him.  <br />
<br />
I really like the idea of his deck, but I think he was trying to do a bit too much.  He packed Imperial Reinforcements (v) to cancel Klorslug, and that couldve been huge if he had gotten it earlier.  When his life gets low enough, the game starts to slow down, and I just keep losing cards from my hand, to retrieve them with Uh-oh (v) to bolster my life.  When the game ends I have no lost pile.<br />
<br />
FW 2 (+38)<br />
<br />
Props:  To Joe for rushing the Throne Room right away, that did slow me down a bit, and usually is the best way to fight a whap deck.  Once whap flips tho, its a real pain trying to take that site back.<br />
<br />
Slops:  None come to mind.<br />
<br />
So I finish 8 (+46), which puts me in 4th place overrall.  (I know the numbers dont add up, at least one of my BHBM losses is by too little.....oh well) Greg beat Kevin in the last round, so places 2, 3, 4, and 5 all finished 4-2.<br />
<br />
Heres the final standings, much thanks to Kelly Krieble for posting!<br />
<br />
Greg Shaw 12(+80) <br />
Kevin Elia 8(+56) <br />
Jared Konsker 8(+53) <br />
Tim Simon 8(+46) <br />
Drew Scott 8(+26) <br />
Steve Yeager 7(+31) <br />
Greg Hitt 6(+22) <br />
Kelly Krieble 6(+13) <br />
Bill Kafer 6(+1) <br />
Tom Martino 6(-1) <br />
Kyle Hartline 6(-16) <br />
Rory ??? 6(-36) <br />
Mike Phelps 4(-59) <br />
Joe Streleckis 4(-100) <br />
Ben Kline 3(-28) <br />
Jeff Johns 2(-105) <br />
Jared Luminetta (drop)<br />
<br />
Greg went undefeated with non-hyperdrive and a crazy Tusken junkyard drain for 7 deck (yes, thats the official title :)  ).  They decide to split the prize money tho, so no FC happens.<br />
<br />
For prize support I got my very first uncut sheet ever, which was kinda cool.  And for packs we get Cloud City and Tatooine.  I think the best rare I pulled was Lobot?  Cant really remember.  Jeff and I hang out a bit, and talk about sw junk with some of the PA natives.....I think we finally left around 10 or so.<br />
<br />
There was a bit of a tense moment when we were ready to start the car to leave.  The inside lights in my car wouldnt turn off, no matter what we did.  The lights under the rearview mirror also wouldnt go off, and I knew it wouldnt at all be prudent to drive in such conditions.<br />
<br />
We seriously spent like 10-15 minutes trying to get those darn lights to go off.....even busted out the manual to try and figure it out.  Finally, I realized my door was still part way open, so I closed it....problem solved.<br />
<br />
Woot woot!  Im not as think as you dumb I am.<br />
<br />
Well thats the end of another fantastic tourney, time for final props and slops.<br />
