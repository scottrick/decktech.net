Me and Dave Lankton (originally from MI, now living in DC) decided to make the trip long <br />
before we had any plans for Dragoncon, with no real intentions of doing that well but still being competitive. This was my first major Con, since I just turned 19 and could never make the out of state trips when I was in high school. I did go to Freedomcon last year, but that <br />
was just a day trip since it was in PA (I&#39;m from Maryland, so it was only a 90 minute drive). I haven&#39;t played in many big tournaments, but I&#39;ve done pretty well in the ones I&#39;ve played in. 2nd at MD states 2001, 2nd at Y4 regionals 2002, 6th at Freedomcon 2002, and I won MD states and Mystic Visions this year. So, I was really looking forward to playing in another big tournament.<br />
<br />
We get up there Thursday, I play a secret squirrel, do really bad, and then chill. I sit down to finish up decks, and realize just how bad the dark side is. I&#39;ve been playing combat recently, but it just didn&#39;t have a punch to it. I spend all night and all day Friday working on a TIE deck and then a SYC deck, just to traexhaust and build the standard senate after talking with Gemme and Desai. They walk over during a few games with my combat against <br />
Gogolen, and I talk them into a few changes for Saturday. <br />
<br />
The DPC goes pretty well, after a really sucky start:<br />
Game 1- My LS Combat vs. Brian Fred Deal - Full Loss<br />
Game 2- My DS Senate vs. Ryan Fojtek WHAP - Full Loss<br />
Game 3- My DS Senate vs. Bill Kafer LU(V) - Full Win<br />
Game 4- My LS Combat vs. Greg Shaw Hunt Down - Full Win<br />
Game 5- My DS Senate vs. Someones Combat Racing - Full Win<br />
Game 6- My LS Combat vs. Drew Scott Rallops - Full Win<br />
Game 7- My LS Combat vs. Graham Neal Walkers - Full Win<br />
Game 8- My DS Senate vs. Brian Hunter LU(V) - Full Loss<br />
<br />
I went 5-3, if I had beat Hunter, I woulda made top 4. I didn&#39;t draw a Lott Dod, a Squabbling, or a TIE Cannon until my next to last turn, he got Goo out first turn, and I even had him down to 9 with a small hand before he retrieved about 10. I ended up in 9th place, which was good enough for NOTHING. Oh well, now I knew I would be going to Dragoncon.Somewhere in the weekend, I met Munchkin, who kept asking me for dice and how old I was.<br />
<br />
Went home.<br />
<br />
Me and Dave make plans for Dragoncon, figure out we will stay with Greg Shaw and crew. Chris Gogolen and Drew Scott will also be staying with us. The week before we&#39;re supposed to leave, Dave has to back out because of his girlfriend moving back to Michigan on what would <br />
be day 2.<br />
<br />
So after a few locals with crappy dark decks (mostly Deal) and my standard Light combat, I realize I&#39;m going to have to drive down by myself because it&#39;s too late to find a reasonable plane ticket. 11 hours in the car is a pain in the ass. I spend the whole week before leaving talking to Brad Reinhold about this new SYC beats deck he built, which we definitely think has some potential. He built it to beat TRM, so we play around with the deck list and he builds the deck for us to test on Friday. He is staying <br />
with Angelo and Pistone, so I figure maybe I can play a few games with them also for some more testing.<br />
<br />
I arrive early Thursday evening, with Greg and them about 60 miles behind me. I show up at the wrong Days Inn, later to find out where the right one is and still beat them by about an hour. A huge storm was moving through while I sat in traffic, so I got to look around at Atlanta some and see the cow parade, which was a pretty strange sight. It&#39;s a bunch of cows painted by different organizations (like schools and stuff), but for some reason about half <br />
of the ones I passed were on fire. Maybe they don&#39;t like farms, or dairy, or animals there? Thursday night, most of our crew (Greg Shaw, Chris Gogolen, Bill Kafer, Jon Dansbury, myself, and later joined by Drew Scott) went to the diner attached to our hotel (Day&#39;s Inn). As soon a they brought the food out, I took a bite out of my Chicken Sandwich, stopped breathing when I started choking on it, and practically died right there while everyone just <br />
watched. I finally got Greg to hit me on the back and I ran into the bathroom to clean up. Pretty embarrassing, but at least I didn&#39;t die. Everyone joked about how thats the first thing going in their TR, so I&#39;d like to read what they have to say about it. We playtest some, Greg beats my Combat with his Huntdown (which surprised me and made me a little angry, that that could happen), and beat my thrown together Deal with his TRM. So he definitely had <br />
both his decks for Saturday, I had nothing.<br />
<br />
I had to pick Drew up at the airport around midnight, played a game with him, and went to sleep. He had to wake up to play Classic Day 1 the next day, while Chris decided he would just wait and play in the open (everyone else had their bye).<br />
<br />
I sleep in a little, but get to see the start of the classic day 1. only 8 played, so 4 qualified: Drew Scott, Chris wod&#105;cka, and 2 others I forgot. Looks like the open will have alot of competition. I call Brad, and head over to his room for some testing of that dark SYC deck we&#39;re betting on.<br />
<br />
When I get there, he is a few turns into a game with Luke from New Zealand with TRM, which I take over and beat him by just a few, thanks to the giant Jedi Council drain. Not exactly the results we were looking for. So, I start building a dark combat deck. Trash. Quick look <br />
through Brads Huntdown. eh, It&#39;ll do ok hopefully. Leave with no idea for a dark deck, other than Huntdown.<br />
<br />
Day 1 Classic ends, and I grab a pick-up game with wod&#105;cka. I pull out the SYC deck, which beats his LS Senate pretty badly, giving me some decent confidence in the deck. It would definitely be fun, I admit that. Day 1 Open starts, qualifiers after 6 games are Andy McClure <br />
<br />
(who won the tournament), Mike Gemme, Chris Gogolen, Graham Neal, and Matt Luexhaust looked like there was some good competition to make top 5. <br />
<br />
I play some Uno with Munchkin and Gogolen, actually win a hand, and then get back to SW. Me and Drew head back to our room with Reid Smith, play a few games, and Reid emphasizes how bad Huntdown is. I spend another 3 hours making a dark deck, and end up with the stupid SYC <br />
deck again. It beats Reids Hidden Base, but I hate it so much. So, I go to sleep, knowing I&#39;m in alot of trouble.<br />
<br />
Wake up, realize I need to build a Huntdown deck. I haven&#39;t played Hunt down in 3 years, but it seems solid so I gotta go with it. Not a bad choice, but I know it&#39;ll be risky. Me and Dansbury go to get chinese, and my fortune says &quot;You will win a high prize or award&quot;. This <br />
is funny to me and Dansbury, so I kept it. We head over to the con so I can do my Dark deck list, and play a quick game with it. Mike Raveling watches. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to play Huntdown in Day 2.<br />
<br />
Day 2 starts not too late, and I have to play Mike who beat me in a Epp Overdrive tournament Friday night, which wasn&#39;t even close. And he just watched my entire game with Dansbury, no good. So, maybe I will get revenge, for sealed?<br />
<br />
Game 1: my Huntdown vs. Mike Raveling WYS <br />
Well, I knew I had dropped most of my space, but I wasn&#39;t counting on seeing alot of WYS. So, right from the beginning, I had to speed things up. First turn Vader in the cantina, and later followed with a saber. He got Projection down real fast, and Kessel set up on turn 2 <br />
or 3. Luke (V) comes to Tatooine for retrieval, and with him playing Flash of Insight practically every turn I know I&#39;m behind in the damage race. I cancel Celebration the turn he plays it, then he top decks the other. We start to think real hard towards the end, and after Maul kills him off of 2 sites he lands Luke to flip me back while I finally get Maul&#39;s ship to let Dr. E combo fly around to satisfy Battle Plan. Once I&#39;m flipped back, I have <br />
nothing to fight with from drain damage and lose by 2.<br />
<br />
Total 0-1<br />
Great, I drive 11 hours and lose again. Worst that can happen, I lose my next one and come back to win 5 in a row again against Dansbury. Well, maybe not 5 against Dansbury, but pick up a few easy games.<br />
Dansbury won (his only win of the day), so I&#39;m not even that lucky. Since I only lost by 2, i actually have to play someone who won. I&#39;m about the 7th game down the table, which isn&#39;t bad for a first game loss.<br />
<br />
Game 2: my Combat vs. Andy McClure Dark Combat<br />
I hate combat vs. combat. It&#39;s not fun, it&#39;s not interesting, and it&#39;s not usually predictable. Especially against Andy McClure. I wanted and easy game! Well, Andy had just won the Day 1 open qualifier, which made me a little nervous knowing he was at the top of his game. He starts Crush the Rebellion, IAO Combo, and Mob Points Combo. Crush? Well, this screws my hand size for the entire game. He also pulls the Oppressive Enforcement shield right away, so our 2 SAC wars (I won both, 3 senses and 2 alters each) were not as big as they could have been. I forget to grab the first Blow Parried (Day 2 Mistake #1), and debate grabbing the second one at all (in favor of the Monnok, so I could draw cards), but since he <br />
grabbed the Strike Blocked I have to do it. I have an Escape Pod in hand all game, but Qui-Gons End never comes down (even though Free Ride Combo spotted it). I lost about 60% of combats (all towards end-game), but after I dropped my 2nd Han/Chewie/Falcon to his Kashyyyk, I was the only one inflicting drain damage. Corran also visited his 1/0 docking bay, and I beat Prophetess down for a few with Lando and Leia. I win by about 14. Props to <br />
Andy for drawing up on his last turn, cause I woulda been screwed if he didn&#39;t.<br />
Total 1-1<br />
Ha! Not 0-2! I find out that Hunter just lost to Chu, Clint lost a game, Hayes isn&#39;t doing <br />
<br />
well, and Bastian, Greg, Chris, Justin are all 2-0. I don&#39;t know who everyone played, but there were some big matchups between big names early on.<br />
<br />
Game 3: my Combat vs. Lautaro Leiva Hunt Down<br />
We sit down, and he asks if we are going to be playing a friendly game. Not knowing exactly what he means, I say sure, don&#39;t worry about it, I&#39;m cool. I guess he was just checking to see if I was going to be a stickler or anything (which I&#39;m usually not). He is playing that <br />
Womp Rat / Imperial Domination tech, Judicator for shooting ships and all. He gets a fast start with a first turn someone, I think. I get Honor with Insight, since he didn&#39;t start No Escape, and combat with QuiGon and eat the drain for a turn. After a Judicator hits the lost pile, I realize that I shouldn&#39;t lose to a deck with star destroyers and guns in it, but hes pressing me pretty hard on the ground. After 3 more turns or so, he eventually gets 2 Jedi, 3 guys including GM Tarkin and a stormtrooper cadet. he knows I have to kick him off Naboo, and he&#39;s going to make it tough. No Escape hits the table for a Trooper Sabacc back to his hand, which he plays and I promptly grab. This is a friendly game, but not that friendly :)Crazy Stupid trooper cadets make it so I can&#39;t kill a whole lot of guys at once, and Tarkin makes its even tougher. I set Lando, Luke, and QuiGon in front of his 25+ power (after combating and moving over a few times, and a short battle with Yoda and Quigon). He drops <br />
someone else, I barrier, and he battles. Coward came out, so Lando doesn&#39;t retrieve my 7 I lost to Visage. Oh well. I hit the cadet (send to used), hit tarkin (send to used), and draw high. He only has one Dark Jedi left (Vader?) who moves away, I combat away on my next turn, and that was pretty much the end. Visage did alot of damage to him that game.<br />
<br />
Total 2-1<br />
Clint lost to Brian Hunter again, Hayes loses again, Greg and Bastian are 3-0 and the top <br />
<br />
table next game. Pairings are called, it&#39;s me a Graham Neal. We had a good game at Origins, which was alot closer than the score looked. One mistrack either way woulda killed us, and I got some pretty decent retrieval off against his walkers before he drew up. I was looking <br />
forward to another good game, but I knew he was playing WYS so I could already tell it wasn&#39;t going to be pretty after my first game.<br />
<br />
Game 4: my Huntdown vs. Graham Neal WYS<br />
First turn Vader to the Cantina again, and he stays there all game. No PoaS, and after Visage and a turn of drains he already lost Red Squadron 1 and the Pulsar Skate. Han is holding down Kessel for a few turns, but Zuckuss and 4Lom kill him and aren&#39;t touched for the rest of the game, while the outrider sits at Tatooine. Maul battles a few small guys off of docking bays, Sidious drains at the Back Door, and this game is over before anything real eventful happens. I win by 25.<br />
<br />
Total 3-1<br />
Wow, 3-1? I know I have a few hard games coming up, but I won a game with the Hunt Down! Bastian beat Greg, so the only undefeateds are Bastian and Desai. I know that going into game 5 I&#39;m number 3 (just ahead of Greg), so I know I have the advantaged matchup.<br />
<br />
Game 5: my Combat vs. Greg Shaw Huntdown<br />
Me and Greg have played this sooo many times, all the games blend together. I know he never managed to keep more than 1 Jedi on the table, and no one went out of play. I don&#39;t think Qui-gon left the table more than once. Prophetess came down late game to the Holotheatre, <br />
where she was beaten up for about 8 by Lando and Corran. That was the end of the game. I won by about 15.<br />
<br />
Total 4-1<br />
Now I&#39;m surprising myself, but I know that since my differential is really high I only need to win 1 more game and not lose the other 2 by a whole lot, and I&#39;m in top 8. Desai won, Gogolen is also 4-1, so he plays Justin while I get to play Bastian for the first time ever. I am still at the second chair, for like the 3rd game in a row I think. John Anderson took a good picture during this round.<br />
<br />
Game 6: my Hunt Down vs. Bastian Winkelhaus Speeders<br />
Speeders! I hate speeders! Opening hand, no Dark Time for the Rebellion, but I do have a Blizzard 4. I play it to the 4th marker, get Lord Vader, and DRAW UP MY LAST FORCE.<br />
I am such a scrub sometimes. I recycle, tell Bastian to lose to Visage, and he promptly places Blizzard 4 OOP and Vader in my lost pile. Ouch. I&#39;ve been playing good all day, and then this? Well, at least I recovered. I drew into another Vader next turn (I only ran 4), who came down with Palapatine and Janus to the Back Door. Maul and Sidious battle a few times on Hoth, while I try to find <br />
my 5th marker to completely shut him down. He burns Obi and QuiGon kicking me off Hoth, and after I play the 5th marker it looks really bad for Bastian. He can&#39;t flip me back, he can&#39;t occupy 2 battlegrounds (no way to lower the shield, and he only has the system), so Coward does it&#39;s job. I lose 2 to direct damage, while he is losing to Visage and my Back Door drain. He gets a good setup in his hand, with Mirax and Wedge on Rogue 3 to cancel destiny, <br />
and comes at me on Endor. I held onto Fett in my hand for a long time, so I come back down after he kills Palpatine and force him to lose both to attrition with 3 destiny (one cancelled). This seals the game, and I win by 12. Something else may have had a dramatic effect on this game, but it was a while ago, I don&#39;t really remember.<br />
<br />
Total 5-1<br />
Now I&#39;m surprising everybody.. I&#39;ve never played, let alone beat a former world champion. <br />
<br />
Gogolen beats Desai, so the top 2 going into game 7 are me and Chris. No more undefeateds, and it&#39;s almost a lock that we are both in if we don&#39;t tip the scales too much. Chu is still up at the top, Greg hanging in there, and Brian Hunter is towards the end but coming back strong. Clint worked his way through, Mike Gemme is doing well, everything is looking like it&#39;s wrapping up good. Except for me sitting there, feeling pretty well out of place. Nick Kolnik checks my dark deck, and I have 2 glaring errors. But so do 4 other people in the top 8, so I don&#39;t feel bad. My light turns out fine, and I will never have an error again, I promise!!<br />
<br />
Game 7: my Combat vs. Chris Gogolen Walkers<br />
Walkers! I hate Walkers! Opening hand is golden, with 6 characters (no dupes), an interrupt I don&#39;t remember, and Han/Chewie/Falcon. I drop Quigon first turn, draw a few. For some reason or another, I feel extremely force choked this game. I can never go to space, which hurts considering he only had a bounty hunter hip out. I do get a Mech Failure and drop it on Blizzard 1 after the shield is gone, but he barriered Luke and Lando came to join him. He comes back with another walker and GM Tarkin, battles Luke away, to be redeployed next turn. I have a 20 card hand, but no sense, so the Garrison goes through after Luke and Lando die again. I have played this matchup a ton of times, and this was by far the worst game ever for my Light deck. I probably forgot For Luck (V) twice or so, which could have been huge, but Chris played like a champ and I had nothing left after the garrison went off. A few <br />
turns later, I was out, with him around 18 or 19.<br />
<br />
Total 5-2<br />
Ok, after checking some numbers, I know that at least a few 5-3s will get in, and I&#39;m still in the top 4, so I only have to keep my loss differential down (if I lose) and I&#39;m in. Of course, I get to play Jonny Chu(6-1), so I don&#39;t expect much in the way of fortune for myself. I&#39;ve never played him before, but I&#39;ve heard some things :)<br />
Mike and Justin end up playing each other, I play Chu, and Chris plays Greg. Not sure what happened further down<br />
the table, but Brian had just lost to Bastian, so he was out, Clint was still contending, and I know there was probably a few others with the chance to win big enough to put them in. I sit down across from Jonny (who, BTW, is definitly the nicest guy who plays wars, and deserves all the respect and money and everything else he has earned), shake hands, let him know my situation. Don&#39;t beat me by alot I say, and then I find out he&#39;s trying to help Mike <br />
and Justin both get in ! So he has it in for me, which guarantees a hard match.<br />
<br />
Game 8: my Huntdown vs. Jonny Chu Speeders<br />
Speeders! I hate speeders! I get lucky and draw into a Dark Time first turn, which pulls the Ice Plains when he pulls a site. The big plan is for my Wampa to eat Romas, which means I lock him down for the entire game, but Obi makes quick lightsaber work of the Wampa, so no dice. Vader is draining at the Back Door with PoaS, I&#39;m flipped about half of the time, and Sidious/ Blizzard 4 are holding down a Hoth Site. When I think about it, the only battle the entire game was Obi-wan attacking my Wampa, I think. Luke flys around outside with the shield down keeping me flipped sometimes, and Maul eventually drops to the Ice plains to try and get rid of him. Barrier. I thought he lost the Ice Storm, but it does take out Maul and shortly afterwards Sidious, because I didn&#39;t move because I wasn&#39;t thinking, but it was the last turn of the game anyway. I had way more force then him, but he was doing more damage. He had me permanently flipped between Obi and Luke, so Visage waexhaustting us both. I did <br />
Take Evasive Action his T47 Battle Formation, which was nearly game saving, and it came down to one card each at the end of his turn. Apparently, with Visage, the person who is ending thier turn gets to decide who loses first. So, I lost, and Jonny wins by 1. Everyone cheers, there <br />
must have been 20 people watching our game. It was cool to see everyone watching OUR game, and the looks on peoples faces when it ended. It was also talked about alot, even thought it didn&#39;t really matter, we both still made it (and would have). That game was insane, ask anyone who was watching it. And then ask about the look on OUR faces when we heard the Visage ruling.	<br />
<br />
Ending: 5-3<br />
So, I lost to Chu by 1, Gogolen by 19, and Raveling by 2. Not bad at all, and it was good enough for 7th place, and a spot in day 3. <br />
<br />
Prizes are handed out, top 8 announced, pairings decided, and we agree to be there by 11 to re-sleeve and start the games. And Reid went 2-6 :)<br />
<br />
After all this, we finally get out of there somewhere between 11 and 12. Seems to be alot of drinking, alot of poker, but the other 5 of the final 8 disappear. Me, Greg, and Chris head back to the room working on figuring out what we have to do to win the big $$, and our plan is pretty solid. We know Bastian played speeders and walkers day 2, and since he planned on starting out in the LOTR tournament we thought that he wouldn&#39;t have the time (or desire) to make new day 3 decks. So, for Chris, we talked him into going all-out with decks to beat walkers and speeders. Me and Greg wandered around until 430 looking for Brian Fred, because he was pretty certain he wanted to play the WHAP and Chris needed to see his Deal deck. So, we worked on teching out his deal deck to beat speeders (we even put a frostbite in, to kill retrieval), and he made the Jersey Gencon MBO to destroy walkers. He knew it was a big gamble. Some crazy homeless guy asks me and Greg if we want to go watch CNN with him, we&#39;re like yeah right. He follows us for a few minutes, but we get away. We finally find Fred asleep (with no shirt on, haha), and tell Howard/Olsen our deck plans, and Howard tells Olsen that if MBO wins worlds, he&#39;s fired as head card designer. It was funny, he probably really meant it. Greg kept his Huntdown, and changed just a few cards in Fred&#39;s WHAP. Fred went 4-4 day 2, so he didn&#39;t understand why anyone would want his decks, but he handed them over and didn&#39;t <br />
have a problem with it. The WHAP did pretty good, in the end. I threw another Take Evasive Action (V) in, because I was expecting a few combats and speeders, and took all the space out of both my decks. I figured that it wouldn&#39;t do a whole lot of good to keep the extra crap around in my decks, when I knew I wouldn&#39;t be using it, so <br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
1.Jonny Chu - LS Combat / DS Senate<br />
8.Mike Gemme - LS Senate / Huntdown<br />
<br />
2.Greg Shaw - WHAP / Huntdown<br />
7.Me        - LS Combat / Huntdown<br />
<br />
3.Chris Gogolen - MBO / Deal<br />
6.Bastian Winkelhaus - QMC / Huntdown<br />
<br />
4.Justin Desai - LS Combat / DS Senate<br />
5.Clint Hays - TRM / Walkers<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s what I KNOW happened:<br />
<br />
Quarterfinals:<br />
<br />
Chu and Gemme: Gemme won by 7 over Chu&#39;s Combat, but Chu won in the teens with his Senate.<br />
<br />
Me and Greg: He chose to play the Hunt down vs. my combat first, because we knew the matchup could go either way, we had each others decks memorized, and he was very confident he made the changes he needed to beat me. No such deck! Same as all are other games, and I win by 16.<br />
Game 2: His WHAP vs. my Huntdown<br />
Now, I knew what he was playing, but I was too worried about my next game to be ready for this matchup. I thought Bubo and my strong characters combined with Visage could definitly win this game, probably by a decent amount. I got a first turn Vader, and he even took 4 turns to flip, but I never challenged him in the Throne Room (I knew he was running enough anti-battle stuff, I was just trying to out-damage him), but between Flash, ICBW, and Sio Bibble and flipped Objective text, he quickly took over. I couldn&#39;t get rid of his jedi, so I was flipped most of the game, and Bubo attacked Quigon (instead of Panaka) 5 times in a row. If I had fought him in the Throne Room, I think I definitly would have been better off, but I chose the wrong route this game. Greg played like a champ, and this game probably took more than 90 minutes, but he deserved it. He won by 17, so he had 2 (+1) over me and got to play Bastian.<br />
<br />
Gogolen and Bastian: Bastian DID change decks, and beat the hell out of Chris. Too bad, but Chris took the biggest risk and we all felt bad that we pushed the MBO and Deal on him, to beat specific decks. Bastian played Huntdown and QMC, and beat Chris in both games by a good amount. I think Antilles Maneuver had a big role in the second game.  <br />
<br />
Desai and Hays: Justin played Combat first, to go for the big win, but only got Clint by like 13. Clint&#39;s TRM beat the KTOD Senate by more.<br />
<br />
Semifinals:<br />
<br />
Chu and Hays: Chu picked the combat first, and was beating Clint pretty badly. If they finished, he would have had 30+, but Clint conceded and they did not play a second game.<br />
<br />
Bastian and Greg: Greg picked the Huntdown first, and beat the hell out of Bastians QMC by 29. <br />
<br />
The other game (Huntdown vs. WHAP) starts insanely fast for Bastian, and for the first 10 turns, it looked very possible that he could win that game by 30. When Bastian had about 32 cards left, Greg finally manuevered his own flip, wiped Bastian off the table, and pretty much sealed the game. With only 32 cards left, no hand, and nothing on the table, it&#39;s quite hard to win by 30. The game didn&#39;t finish out, but Greg would have started dealing major damage shortly after, and probably could have won the game.<br />
<br />
Clint beat Bastian for 3rd place.<br />
<br />
Greg and Chu:<br />
<br />
Chu picks his combat deck first, because combat is just that good. Greg is pretty dejected this game, especially after our first round match. I&#39;m actually on the phone this whole matchup, so I don&#39;t get to see all of it, but Chu ends with the win by 17 I think. Greg picked the WHAP to beat senate, which it definitly does. He doesn&#39;t get a fast start, but the Senate pick up the damage rate quick, so as the game winds down it looks like Greg would win<br />
by 7 or 8. They don&#39;t finish, if I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
Congrats to both of them and everybody else! The first place trohpy was NICE, I wish I woulda had a better shot. Stupid WHAP.<br />
<br />
Phew, that was too much Wars for me. Everyone is just sorta chilling out, I play some Yatzee with Brian Hunter and Munchkin, and it turns out Brian owns me at Yatzee too. This is after he had been insulting me, Greg, and Chris, but he&#39;s really an OK guy so we had fun. Reid joined us and starting throwing cards at random people, none of whom got too mad, luckily. A pirate walks by, <br />
and Munchkin asks him why his eye patch is on his forehead instead of his eye. He doesn&#39;t have a *good* reason, so she borrows it for awhile. She puts it on her own forehead after awhile, and then the pirate comes back and asks her why she&#39;s wearing it on her forehead, if she took it away <br />
from him for doing the same thing. Funny, you shoulda been there. Everyone should have been there.<br />
<br />
A regular Swiss starts, Reinhold takes my Huntdown deck (that I still need back!!), does pretty well with it. I think Andy McClure won the whole thing, but alot of people were dropping to play poker. Mike and Justin ask Greg if we all want to go out, he tries to find me but we can&#39;t find them again. So Munchkin, Greg, Bill, Chris, Dansbury, myself go to eat at our hotel again, then head back to the con. All the poker games are full, and alot of people are watching the LOTR finals with Dalton. We talk to Justin and Mike for awhile, and I borrow a deck of cards from <br />
Munchkin. I had to lie to get them, but she understands! She took them back (some of the cards were marked anyway) after a game with Fred, Greg, me, and a few others, but then I got a deck from Clint. we play 2 more, and Munchkin is our permanent dealer for a few rounds. Then she threw <br />
a beer at Howard, which got all over me, and she sorta got kicked out of our table. She apologized, but everyone was pretty pissed. When poker wrapped up, I hung out with her for a few hours. We went back up to my room, played more Yatzee (we really did). Greg said Howard was about to take bets on what we were doing, and when Greg and everyone else walked in they started laughing. Sorry this all took me so long, school/work/work is a pain in the ass. But, I hope this helped fill in the gaps if anyone was wondering.<br />
<br />
If DPC New Jersey comes about, I&#39;ll definitly be there, hopefully alot of people will. If not, <br />
<br />
see you next year!<br />
<br />
