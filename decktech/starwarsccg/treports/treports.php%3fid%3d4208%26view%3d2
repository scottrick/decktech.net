<br />
so i try to figure out what kind of ds can beat a beatdown deck, like my brothers trm and my senate.  first off, i need sac protection.  that means hunt down, or start TINT/OE.  second, i need to not rely on mob points for activation at docking bays, in case i can&#39;t get my system out.  third, i need to deal out enough damage to overcome any deck, while still being impervious to beatdowns, and providing a few beatdowns of my own.  i eventually settled on lightsaber combat.  it drains 4 on the second turn, often keeping that drain going for a nice long time before being attacked.  its also amazingly resilient to beatdowns, because with TINT/OE on table you&#39;ve got stunning leader, and if that fails for any reason you get to knock puny characters down the shaft or use maul strikes/i have you now to cause a lot of damage.  plus you have TPM making sure maul doesn&#39;t get hit often, and dark forces V making them have to try harder to hit him.  plus Dark forces V forces a re-draw, meaning they have to save enough cards in their reserve deck to still draw battle destiny if you cancel it.  to add to this factor, i play no match for a sith, which forces them to draw an additional 2 cards and hopefully reduces somebody to 0 power.  so i throw this deck together, a near version of which i posted the other day (Nightspawn: Let Them Make The First Move v3.0, although its not really like any of my other Nightspawn decks).<br />
<br />
so my brother and i make the 3 hour drive to seattle, find cardhaus games, and realize we&#39;re like 2 hours early for this tournament.  so we play a game of lotr, and we kicks my butt all over the place since i&#39;m playing dunland.  unfortunately i was stupid enough to not change my deck before the lotr tournament the next day, and ended up going 0-3 with it.  stupid dunland.<br />
<br />
eventually kyle shows up and we do some trading...i aquire my second R2D2 in Red 5...philip aasen shows up from olympia with a few friends he&#39;s been teaching the game to for the last year or so.  some more seattlites show up, and eventually keith walks in about 5 minutes late, cursing the transportation system.<br />
<br />
rating going into this tourney: 1639 or so, still hurting from like an 80 point drop at that 0-4 november tournament.<br />
<br />
Game 1:  my DS vs. Keith Watabayashi (1991)&#39;s WYS docking bays.<br />

i&#39;m a little intimidated, but i try not to show it.  keith is not just a good player, he&#39;s a *fast* player, just in the way he shuffles and moves cards around and gets things set up, so its a little intimidating if you&#39;re not used to it.  however, this time i was expecting his play style so i was able to ignore it and not get caught up in trying to play as fast as he does and thus make mistakes.  anyway, i start dark forces instead of TINT/OE and get a first turn maul down at the core, pull his saber, and save force for a barrier/stunning leader, can&#39;t remember which.  also get down carida thanks to mob points.  he starts setting up his hand, but not doing much yet.  at one point he puts down a lone han w/blaster at a docking bay and i play vader in front of him and initiate battle, but he cancels it or barriers or something.  this game is a little hazy in my mind although i was terribly lucid at the time, playing my best.  i had a premonition of disaster so i just kind of let vader sit there...i expected him to have life debt in his hand and be all ready to react with a free chewie with it, so i just sat tight and faced him down.  meanwhile always draining with maul.  he put down some shmoe in space, so i responded with zuckuss, but i forgot he had his AO out so i couldn&#39;t break his immunity, but still blocked the drain there and let myself off from paying to drain.  this game was a little weird because we always had people staring each other down but never battling. he had that ship againt my zuckuss and neither one of us would battle, same with han and vader.  really weird.  he also never came against me at the core, which was fine by me.  for most of the game i had a stunning leader, imp barrier, and ghhhk combo in my hand, just waiting for him to try something.  eventually i dropped broken fett with vader and battled, but he fallen portal&#39;d vader out of his lost pile.  he stuck a freighter captain at the cantina, i responded with dre & panda for a few overflow, and held that for the rest of the game pretty much, so now i had two drains of 2 going, sometimes adding 2 more to my core drain.  he starts running from broken fett while i&#39;m paying upkeep, so i drop ig-88 w/gun against han, and promptly get fallen portal&#39;d.  he&#39;s playing all these portals from his lost pile, and i already grabbed the control combo (since that&#39;s what everyone in my area usually abuses with wys).  this one turn he drains me for 1 and i lose the holotable off the top and say i&#39;m glad to get rid of that 0.  then he puts down wedge in red squad 1 against zuckuss, i don&#39;t barrier.  he plays a cannon on him, and i play overload, wishing to god i still had that 0 on my deck.  but instead i flip a 1 and he&#39;s surprised that i would play overload in combat since i&#39;m supposed to have a high destiny average.  i tell him it&#39;s only for xwing cannons and quigon&#39;s r3 saber, so it usually works ok (although this time i was blind drawing it).  by now the game is getting really close, i&#39;ve lost some force but mostly its from putting cards on the table or adding to my drains, although he&#39;s gotten some good drains off on me.  he initiates against zuckuss, although he can&#39;t draw destiny, and i can&#39;t remember if i decided to lose him instead of battle damage or keep him in space so i don&#39;t have to pay to drain.  i think i lost him.  anyway, things are heating up at the tatooine docking bays as i&#39;m running out fo characters, already having used my imp reinforcements to get back a vader.  eventually i&#39;ve all but drained him out and i&#39;m starting to put cards back with drop...i remember putting a 7 and some 5&#39;s down and recirculating, then i noticed that he was so spread that i could come within 2 of draining him out, but he would drain me for like 7 (i had 11 life force left) next turn.  he was blocking my dre & panda with a scrub again, so i activated all my force, drained him to that 2 left, then battled the scrub, praying that i had put the 7 down as the bottom card.  flipped my destiny, foil AI TPM.  he had to lose 2 overflow, and that ended it.  I beat Keith Watabayashi!!<br />
FW, 2(+11)<br />
<br />
Game 2: My LS vs Philip Aasen (1660s)&#39;s Dark Deal<br />
<br />
this was exactly the matchup i was expecting from Philip since he&#39;s never played anything but dark deal ;)  plus we were talking tech before the tournament anyway.  unfortunately, he discovered how to effectively beat my kind of deck with his deal...he got his first turn executor down with i think ozzel onboard, while i didn&#39;t have the falcon in hand anyway.  next few turns he sets it up with thrawn and guri in stinger.  i finally flip, but i think i didn&#39;t have horox ryder in the senate, but i also get the falcon and decide to go after him.  mistake.  even with battle desitny manipulation senate-style, i still lose overflow.  he played imperial command to add a bd, i grabbed it and sensed it (losing 2 + sense to TINT/OE), and only managed to break the stinger&#39;s immunity.  but instead of guri, he loses thrawn and the other pilot of the exec.  next turn he drops the chimaera there too, and i give up on the system.  so by now he has not put *anyone* down on cloud city, instead getting janus and i think the emperor at the exec docking bay (i told him its a bad idea to play that db when you play the exec, so i hope he&#39;s changed it).  he starts stacking his guys there, saying he&#39;ll transit them to cloud city when he&#39;s got enough of a force that i can&#39;t beat it down.  so i start throwing epp&#39;s across cloud city and pay to drain a few before he can stop me.  meanwhile he&#39;s played his Coward shield but i&#39;m still announcing the drain in the senate chamber just to piss him off until he plays battle order (we&#39;re good friends so its all in fun).  then he starts transiting guys to the city, and trying to block my drains.  unfortunately, the drain at the system has been eating me away, while i haven&#39;t been able to do much to him at all.  so he gets a few more guys down, takes out a few of mine (retrieving force with my draw their fire, dangit), and eventually drains me out.<br />
FL, 2(-5?)<br />
<br />
Game 3: My LS vs. Keith W&#39;s lightsaber combat<br />
<br />
his deck looked a lot like mine, except he was playing some weirdly techish stuff like restraining bolt to stop god threepio from setting up combat destinies, and tentacle to grab AJR and escape pod V so that other interrupts were lower destiny.  luckily none of this ever really worked against me.  however, feltipern trevagg *did* work.  with BFHI down, which i couldn&#39;t get an alter to cancel, i had to deploy guys for at least 7, save 5 to init battle, then have 3 cards to swing (stupid dark forces) and still have 1-3 more cards for battle destiny.  so get below 18 life force and you start getting screwed.  to top that off, he monnoks me early and gets both my epp lukes.  so i drop epp obiwan on maul, he barriers and drops vader and circles me.  i don&#39;t have my grabber out so i can&#39;t grab it and AJR, and i&#39;m not even sure if that would work, plus no sense.  so obi&#39;s out of play, both lukes in lost pile, and i&#39;m kicking myself for taking out the rebel reinforcements even though it would never work because i always had yoda and 2 senators on the table.  so i start being supercareful about my quigons, like after losing one to a combat (before he drew quigon&#39;s end), i deployed the other one, plus a senator to the coruscant docking bay so i&#39;d have 2 battlegrounds for draw their fire, and retrieved quigon.  i tried to keep that circle going, but it was not to be as he beat down the senator i was saving at the docking bay.  however, thanks to senator palpatine and my battle destiny political effects, i didn&#39;t lose overflow.  pretty soon both quigons were buried in my lost pile, but i had temporarily dropped all the sith off the core where my They Win This Round was waiting to be retrieved.  so i deploy queen amidala rotn off a political effect to the generator (not core), and by this time kyle krueger is watching the game and he tells keith &quot;you better watch out, the queen&#39;s coming down on your a$$!&quot;  then i put lando at the core, retrieve the force, and wait for him to come at lando.  and since i think the top of lost pile was high destiny, he goes after the queen first, and eventually i&#39;m screwed and lose.  i was playing totally the top of my game, too, remembering to use tendau bendon to draw cards, maximizing my senators and their battle destiny manip, using the political effects&#39;s second text, like making him lose a force and stuff.  it was great, but i just got screwed by that early monnok and circle.<br />
FL, 2(-30s?)<br />
<br />
Games 4-6 were all against <1600 scrubs, so i&#39;m not even sure how much of them to talk about.  the tournament was basically decided in the first three games for me, the last three were just me getting knocked down into the lower brackets and trying to amass a huge differential.<br />
<br />
Game 4: my DS vs some guy&#39;s QMC<br />
<br />
this guy was pretty cool, he actually gave away most of his swccg collection after the tournament to philip aasen&#39;s friends, since he wanted out of swccg and they wanted in.  so that right there deserves major props.  anyway, he started setting up qmc while i setup my first turn maul, and eventually i launched a vader/fett/ig88 beatdown on him and took the game.  never had to go to space because he didn&#39;t have d-shields to play battle plan.<br />
FW, 4(0?)<br />
<br />
Game 5/6: one of philip&#39;s friends, probably jason<br />
i played both my last games against this guy. he was pretty cool about it, i mean, we both knew that he was new to the game so i tried to throw him a few tips, although occasionally i corrected a few rules things like using force to move and stuff.  and like many newbies, he totally forgot to save force for draw their fire like every time, so i tried to remind him of that but i still enforced it when he tried to play interrupts and stuff.  i was more worried about coming across like a jerk than actually upping my differential for both games, but i was definitely trying to win.  anyway, his dark side was a weird-starting TIE deck, which he got set up pretty fast.  i was worried b/c my ls has little space, although i added that R2-D2 in Red 5 before the tournament so i was a little more confident. he set up at one of his systems, and i came down with the falcon and spiral or something, he played that ties are +2/immune interrupt which i grabbed, and he never again remembered to save force for the grabber, but i let him play it probably half of the times anyway.  anyhow, after a few turns i completed kicking him off that system, and he started setting up ties at wakeelmui, and eventually a star destroyer.  he tried to move to like sullust (the only system out), but i pointed out he didn&#39;t have enough hyperspeed.  so most of his forces were useless, and meanwhile i was draining at the coruscant and spaceport docking bays.  eventually drained him out and won pretty well.  i don&#39;t even remember his light side, i just know that i played my game and won it unopposed.<br />
<br />
so i ended up 4-2, although 3 of the wins weren&#39;t that challenging.  regardless, i took 3rd place, after keith getting 1st and philip aasen getting 2nd.  i think kyle had 4th and my brother mike 5th, but i might have those reversed.  for prizes i got 2 packs of ref2 and 2 of ref3.  best pull was a foil R2-D2 in Red5!  so that was pretty awesome...and i was glad i had pushed for half the prize support to be in reflections 2, since that set is *much* better than ref 3 once you have all the shields and are only pulling doubles.  anyway, i give some of the extra cards i pulled to jason and his brother, and eventually we&#39;re off.<br />
<br />
props:<br />
--keith for running an excellent tournament, although at one point i had to help him with the pairings because they were so messed up from only having 8 people in a 6 game tourney.<br />
--philip for coming all the way from olympia and bringing his friends (actually they brought him)<br />
--jason and his brother for jumping into this game with both feet and trying to learn as much as they can.  i played jason&#39;s brother at the Seattle DPC in a friendly game, where i cleaned his clock because his deck was basically all commons, so he was all scared of me this tournament, but we never had to play each other.<br />
--mike for driving me and actually being excited about a swccg tourney for once<br />
--the pairings gods for not once matching me up to my brother in this tournament.  honestly, you do not know how cool that is since when we play against each other in sanctioned games, it just gets ugly.  ask the currans, lol.<br />
--kyle krueger for deciding that DS senate is worth getting the cards to build<br />
--the guy who gave away his collection (eric?): that is totally cool to help out newbies like that, you deserve some kind of award.<br />
<br />
slops:<br />
--the pairings gods for never matching me up to kyle since he&#39;s fun to play against (and because i usually beat him somehow)<br />
--mike for accidently turning off his headlights while driving through some of the worst weather ever seen on I-90.  what the $&%@ where you doing?!?  scared the everloving sith out of me...<br />
<br />
well, the two decks i played that day have been retired...the LS because it relies far too much on broken lando and the falcon combo, which seem to take a serious slam in the new v-set (and really, that deck is a TON of fun to play, but somehow i&#39;ve only done mediocre with it...it seems so much better than it really is, imho), and the DS because....because....hell, i just wanted to post it on decktech because i&#39;m so proud of it.  dude, it beat keith watabayashi!  lol, sorry keith but i&#39;m still proud of that game...<br />
