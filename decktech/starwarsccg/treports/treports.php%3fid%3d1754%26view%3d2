<br />
Nothing too much to explain about the pre-tourny, but Jim Sells (a cool guy and a good player from Nashville) came down, so I was looking forward to a game or 2 with him. Before the tournament, we mainly just sat around wishing we could go to the DPC in Illinois. But alas, I would have to miss 4 baseball games (which I wouldn&#146;t do), and I don&#146;t have a ride. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Well, nothing much happened before the tournament, so I&#146;ll explain the decks I was planning to play. For DS, I have the same HD I&#146;ve played several weeks in a row. It is very effective and plays like a machine, and has never lost a game in playtesting, if I remember correctly. It was non-duel with tons of support characters. Maybe I&#146;ll post it some day.<br />
<br />
For LS this week, I was planning to play TIGIH, because for some reason I had an insane urge to play it (don&#146;t even ask me why). I always insult it because it can&#146;t beat HD, so I figured I needed tons of HD hate to make it work. I had been working with a beats deck with tons of HD hate, and it was working pretty well. Then I decided I wanted to play TIGIH speeder beats, Steven Lewis style, but about ½ hour before the tournament I played a game with it, and realized why I didn&#146;t like that deck. It uses too many cards! I was down to about 20 cards in my deck, and only a few cards were in my lost pile! So about 10 minutes before the tournament, I changed my Speeders deck back to the mains variety I have posted.<br />
SHAMELESS PLUG: Go check out the TIGIH deck I used. It&#146;s called &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and it&#146;s on my page. <br />
<br />
However, I ran into a little problem when I was switching my Speeder deck back to straight mains. I suddenly remembered that I had been proxying my Off The Edges with Alter combo cards, and I didn&#146;t own any. So for the last few minutes before the tournament, I scrambled around asking everyone there if they had any to trade, and of course, as is my luck, no one did. I was in trouble, I could have used On The Edges, but didn&#146;t want to. As I was scrambling through stack of someone&#146;s stack of rares looking, hoping that there was an Off The Edge in there, someone made some sort of comment about Brian Hunter and Steven Lewis (I didn&#146;t hear the whole comment, just their names), and it made me laugh hard out loud. &quot;Heh heh, I could never imagine Steven Lewis or Brian Hunter doing this. Scrambling for cards at the last second wishing they had planned ahead a little more,&quot; I said. We all had a good laugh as a couple more player walked in. I begged them for Off The Edges, and they had them! I picked them up with a couple quick trades, finished exchanging my sleeves, and I was set. <br />
<br />
End pre-tourny junk--<br />
<br />
We had 14 people, and Matt Reed, the director, opted not to play, as that would create a bye. <br />
<br />
1st game: My TIGIH against Matt Passion&#146;s (1442) CCT w/ Jabba&#146;s Prize<br />
As we sat down to play, Matt groaned and said, &quot;Great, I gotta play Andy first round.&quot; I smiled and sat down. I had never played against a CCT deck before, so it would be a learning experience at least. With Han gone, and Luke stuck on Endor, I was gonna have to rely on Leia, Lando, Obi and friends to free the infamous gambler. I got a good opening hand, and he dropped someone first turn to pick Han up. He started moving him toward the chamber, and I won a couple battles with Obi and Leia on the way, but I couldn&#146;t control the site. He used Mara, Jabba and Boelo to get to the Chamber and flipped his objective. From then on, it was an all out assault on the AC. I won several more battles, and used Leia, Obi, Lando and Chewie, along some sweet battle cards, like Clash and Blaster Proficiency to clear the AC and free Han. He lost a couple battles for several cards, and Luke had been drain 2 per turn on Endor and by the time I got Han back, it was pretty much game. He sent a few more characters down as a last ditch effort, but I killed them, too. I set up my On/Off the Edge engine to get about 10 cards back at the end of the game. At the end of the game I had about 8 or 9 card on I Feel The Conflict and I was wishing he wasn&#146;t playing Scum :-)<br />
FW 2(+34, I think)<br />
Game Highs: I learned a couple things about playing against CCT with Jabba&#146;s Prize, and the deck played very well. Sorry About The Mess/Blaster Proficiency is the best card in the game! Winning a TON of battles.<br />
Lows: Heh, letting him flip his objective. I was sure I could keep Han out of the AC.<br />
<br />
2nd game: My teched out HD against Clay Wilburn&#146;s (1782)  TIGIH Scouts<br />
Well, I didn&#146;t know it until the middle of the game, but this deck was just an improved version of Crazy Hermit&#146;s TIGIH Scouts. He added some duel stuff, so it wasn&#146;t an auto-loss against HD Duel, but that didn&#146;t matter against me, I don&#146;t duel. <br />
<br />
I didn&#146;t get a Vader first turn (this deck has a curse about that), so he got to generate a lot first turn while I drew for the big man. He dropped Crix to the H1:DB along with Bruckman and some other scrub, which was a good idea, &#146;cuz he was in for a Mara beating. I decided to drop Vader instead of going to the DB with Mara for the fear of Fallen Portal. Next turn, he just drew. I dropped Mara to the CC Docking Bay and put out Search and Destroy to make him come to me. I had a barrier, but it didn&#146;t matter. He dropped 3 or 4 Scouts on Mara, and Barriering one of them wouldn&#146;t save her, so I just hit one, and killed another by attrition. I drew a 6 for destiny, so he didn&#146;t win the battle. Visage was eating him alive, so he dropped Blount and JPSD Lando to the Holotheatre. I dropped Come Here You Big Coward to buy me a few turns and drew. Next turn, EJP Dengar and Xizor went to extract vengence upon the Visage-cancellers.  I hit Lando and played Sniper Dark Strike to kill him, hit Blount and drew a 5 for destiny, so he lost 11 cards in the battle. Up until that point, it was very even, a great game. But cancelling Visage with a spy pisses me off :-)<br />
For the rest of the game, it was just a drain race. The Emperor and Sim went to Chirpa&#146;s Hut for the fat drain of 2 and our other characters kept maneuvering around to avoid getting killed between the Endor, CC and D* docking bays. I couldn&#146;t lose Vader, because I didn&#146;t have a back up in my hand, and he didn&#146;t want to fight the Emperor, so he let me have the drain of 2. He came somewhat close to converting Vader in the end, because he had 2 cards stacked and a 6 on the bottom of his deck. If he could have battled with Leia, he very well might have converted Vader, but the HD objective screwed his grand ideas of a LS Vader.<br />
FW 2(+21 maybe?)<br />
Total: 4(+about 55)<br />
Game highs: Until the Severe Beating Of A Lieutenant, it was a great game. Even then he played well and almost managed to convert Vader. It was a good game overall. <br />
Lows: No Vader in opening hand, as always. That sucks so bad!<br />
<br />
Game 3: My TIGIH vs. Chris Bentley&#146;s (1968) Agents Of The Black Sun<br />
As always happens to me, Jim Sells and I were both LS this game, so I had no chance of playing him in the tournament. I hate that!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Agents Of The Black Sun has a weakness to TIGIH, but Bentley&#146;s was a good deck. The game was very non-descript. For the most part, I drained on Endor and Tatooine, and he drained at the D* docking Bay with a Presence of the Force with the Emperor, and the Coruscant DB with a Presence with Xizor and Guri and with Fett In Slave 1 at Carida. We had a few skirmishes, but the Emperor couldn&#146;t move to capture Luke, and I didn&#146;t want to mess with Xizor and Guri or the Emperor, for fear of Put All Sections On Alert. Half way through the game, I had 2 Off The Edges in my hand and decided it was time to go ahead and set up that retrieval. I search for my CC Docking Bay, and it wasn&#146;t in reserve, so I played Tunnel Vision for it, and it wasn&#146;t there either. Heh, I had left it out when I switched from Speeders to Mains :-) There&#146;s another move I can&#146;t see Steven Lewis doing, although he did mess up his decklist at day 1 Worlds, which were, unfortunately, just updated :-( The rest of the game went by quickly, and he killed Luke once, who was quickly replaced by a shiny Jedi Luke. In the end, I had won a couple battles, and it was a good game, but my drains finished him. Sorry for the lack of detail, but that was pretty much all that happened. <br />
FW 2(+about 16 -maybe I should have written this down!)<br />
Total: 6(+around 73)<br />
Game Highs: Protecting Luke like a champ, then replacing him when he finally bit the dust.<br />
Lows: It was a very non-interactive game. Not a whole lot of fun. NOT HAVING THE CC Docking Bay in my deck!<br />
<br />
At this point, I am the only undefeated player besides Jim Sells, and I am ahead of Jim by  14 differential. I need to hold on to the 1st place spot so I can get my Signal foil. <br />
<br />
4th game: My HD vs. Brian Buchanan&#146;s (1656) WYS with Harvests<br />
Brian is one of my best friends and his deck is pretty good. I don&#146;t think my HD has ever lost to it (or ever, for that matter), but it has had a couple close games. <br />
<br />
I got an opening hand DLOTS, foil Vader and I saber, so I was happy. I dropped foil Vader with stick to the Cantina for the fat drain of 3. His turn, he activates, plays Cantina Brawl, and I draw a 6 (Damn Emperor), so Vader dies. He then plays Out Of Commision, and I only have 3 cards in lost pile, one of which is a foil (Vader) with a nice, big bow to it. I decide that it is totally unfair to let him pick from the 3, as he can see the tell-tale foil curve, so I shuffle under the table, and ask him to pick which card will be OOC. He says the top one, and thank God it is a Prepared Defenses. He draws, cancels Visage, and it&#146;s my turn. I drop the DLOTS back to the Cantina and No Escape for his Saber to re-equip the Dark Lord and deploy a new Visage. He draws, loses to Visage, I drain, drop the Emperor to the Tatooine:DB. He draws again, and in his draw phase plays Cantina Brawl again, and once again, I draw a 6 (Damn Put All Sections On Alert) and Vader again dies in a bar fight. I get a few more turns of draining, and he finally drops a the Farm. I go to it with Mara, and he drops a Raider in a Craft, a Raider out of a Craft, the Lars&#146; and Talon to beat up on poor Mara. I hit the Lars&#146; and operate with Dark Strike, and kill a Raider by attrition. I drain and draw a couple to go rumble at the Farm next turn. The last few turns involved constant fighting at the Farm while Harvesting was going on. Luckily, I had my grabber, so he only got to Harvest FOUR times. It was a great game, and because I was able to grab his Harvest the first time he played it, I was able to pull it off in the end for 14 cards.<br />
FW 2(+14)<br />
Total for the tournament: 8(+86, I think)<br />
<br />
Jim didn&#146;t win by enough to overcome me, so I get the Signal foil. Jim starts to accept his Masterful Move foil, but discovers that the other foil does not go to 2nd place, but is random. &quot;That is gay!&quot; he exclaims, and I laugh, because it is always funny to me when people other than me use the word, &quot;gay.&quot; However, he wins the random foil, and I tell him, &quot;slightly less gay now, huh Jim?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, it&#146;s still gay,&quot; came his reply, &quot;but not as bad for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
