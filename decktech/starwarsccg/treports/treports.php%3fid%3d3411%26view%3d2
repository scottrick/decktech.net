I&#146;ve had my decks ready for weeks: Dark Side, I&#146;m playing none other than LSC, my Nightspawn v1.1 deck, Let Them Make The First Move And Then Kick Their ***.  It&#146;s geared for battles, a nasty Sith Mains &amp; Toys deck with none of that &quot;Run Away!!&quot; crap that so many LSC decks pull.  I drop a Sith plus a Trooper Garrison, hold a Trooper Assault and a DJ Presence, and let my opponent do something stupid.  The deck rocks, I&#146;ve teched it up against just about everything, except what i played in game 1...Light Side, I was playing my old favorite, The Age of Aquaris 2.0, Hidden Base Techflip.  Only problem was i didn&#146;t have the Battle Plan shield, which sucks....but i figure i can borrow it from somebody.  the gist of the deck is to use Roche to pull a Big One and Asteroid Cave, use that Cave for Battle Plan and Menace Fades, get Leebo on the table and complete a Kessel Run and Rycar&#146;s Run to up the damage.  Works pretty well when i use a Battle Plan shield proxy...<br />
<br />
I get all ready Friday night b/c my younger brother Mike is going to drive me to Wenatchee, an hour and a half away where the tournament is, then drive back to where his girlfriend is on a band trip or something.  After my last class we get into his 1978 Chrysler LeBaron senior citizenmobile, and take off.  right after he grabs the ticket the wonderful CWU parking police left on his windshield.  he lets me drive, which is cool b/c i don&#146;t drive much (don&#146;t have a car) but i love it.  Well we get to Quincy, where the stupid highway hits a red light and takes a left turn to Wenatchee.  I stop for the red light, it goes green, i take off, make the turn, and the car sputters and dies.  i cruise over to the side of the road, turn the key to start it again, it starts and as soon as i get back in the road it dies.  great.  folks, don&#146;t buy 1978 Chrysler LeBarons.  they&#146;re not worth it.<br />
<br />
this has happened before, though, so we know we just gotta let the car sit and cool off, eventually it&#146;ll start again.  my brother goes to a gas station to grab some STP gasline cleaner, i head to McD&#146;s because i missed lunch.  half an hour later, my brother is all worried that even if the car does start, it&#146;ll just die again in Wenatchee, and then die another half dozen times on his way down to his girlfriend&#146;s band trip.  So we decide to give up and drive back to Ellensburg.  And i&#146;m bummed because that means i&#146;m gonna miss the tournament.  and i&#146;ve been practicing and teching forever for this thing.  i eat, breathe, dream star wars ccg.<br />
<br />
we get back, call the parents to discuss the car situation...eventually i decide that Saturday morning, i&#146;m throwing caution to the wind and driving to Wenatchee.  i clear it with Mike, who thinks its a bad idea, and go to bed early.  8am, i&#146;m up bright and early, driving out of town and toward Wenatchee.  really the first time in at least a year that i drove anywhere on a highway or freeway by myself.  kind of exhilirating, but i notice i talk to myself a lot when i&#146;m alone...anyway, i made it through Quincy, the car was fine, didn&#146;t die ever.  I drove into Wenatchee, suddenly realizing i had only a very dim idea where the card shop was.  I made it across the river, miraculously onto the right road, made all the right turns, and ended up in the right place.  so now i know exactly how to get there.<br />
<br />
its 10am and the tourney starts at 1.  so i&#146;m a bit early.  but that&#146;s ok, a couple of us guys always show up early to play some multiplayer Lord of the Rings.  i buy a few packs, get absolutely nothing, and get ready to play.  according to the time-honored tradition, each of the 4 players (except one kid, he was broke) bought a pack of LOTR and put it away for the winner.  its me, Dennis Jeffris, Tom Potter, and _____.  Dennis bids 5, i bid 3, the other two bid zip.  Dennis is first, i&#146;m second, Tom&#146;s third.  Dennis is playing all hobbits of all crazy things, with the site that lets him pull the Gaffer.  It&#146;s his Hobbit Tango deck with bouncing exertions to heal everybody and drop every stinking burden by the second turn, and his shadow is mixed, but mostly Nazgul from what i see.  i start UC Legolas and Arwen and i&#146;m playing mostly Elven Allies with Gandalf and Nazgul, Tom&#146;s got R Gimli and R Legolas and he&#146;s playing Sauron Orcs, the other kid has i don&#146;t know what because he&#146;s sitting too far away, but he plays Nazgul throughout the game.  Dennis moves once, running up against some Nazgul, and he has to kill off Pippin but Hobbit Stealth saves some other little guys.  I double move, also using a Hobbit Stealth to stay alive.  Tom moves, using Legolas to kill off the bad guys.  the kid moves, taking a black breath and a blade tip on Aragorn.  the game continues...Dennis gets out an Aragorn to keep his fellowship alive, i drop a Gandalf after a few turns, and i&#146;m ahead, Tom is playing conditions like mad with his Lidless Eye minions, and the other kid isn&#146;t doing so hot with one dying companion, Thin &amp; Stretched, and somebody else carrying DDotR.  I drop the Balrog on Dennis, so his fellowship is hurting.  I&#146;m at site 6, my turn, i heal up, and get ready to move.  I&#146;ve got the full 5 companion fellowship and everybody else is grumbling that i&#146;m doing too good.  I move, adding a load of twilight, and nobody has any minions.  so i move again, drawing out a couple Lidless Eye kids who i kick out with Archery and Bow of the Galadhrim.  Move limit&#146;s 3 in a 4player game, right?  So I Thror&#146;s map my site 9 which is NOT Summit of Ammon Hen so they can&#146;t draw anything extra (i&#146;ve got 4 burdens by now), and the guys i face are easily dealt with by my extra companions.  I win!  first of my three victory packs had some crazy Lidless Eye condition or event, the second had the Cave Troll!!  everybody&#146;s grumbling about me, i open the third pack and its the Witch King!! by now i&#146;m getting the finger behind my back and people muttering swear words in my direction...we pick up our cards because the tournament director just showed up with a stack of decklist sheets.<br />
<br />
Decklist sheets?  I knew this would be the first ever Rebel Strike Team tournament with official Command Cards (after all, i brought &#146;em myself), but i didn&#146;t realize we&#146;d have to fill out Decklists.  I thought they only used those in high stakes events.  So Jason Herrin, the TD, pulls me aside and asks me to be the second judge since he&#146;s going to play.  We get Dennis Jeffris as our third, and we&#146;re set.  Decklist filling out takes a while, and we&#146;re finally ready to start about a half hour behind schedule.  The shop owner&#146;s wife is there to host the tournament, and since she normally does the matchups, it sort of falls to her to sort out the Command Cards.  I printed up the rules for organizing them and determining the pairings, so she tries to figure those out and eventually we&#146;re ready to start.<br />
<br />
Game 1: My DS LSC vs. Jason Herrin&#146;s LS Jedi Chamber LSC<br />
We are both terrified going into this matchup.  I never thought i&#146;d see a Light Side Combat deck, so i never bothered to test against it.  he&#146;s only played one test game of this kind, so he&#146;s not sure he can pull out the win.  First turn, i pull Carida, activate, play Carida and the Holotable, and draw most of my cards.  His first turn, he plays Theed DB and draws up.  I&#146;m holding Maul, Vader, and Tarkin, so i&#146;m feeling pretty good.  My turn, i activate everything i can, put Maul w/saber at the Core, Vader and Tarkin at the Generator and sit back as he flips.  He might have waited one more turn, but he dropped Padme at the Core, then pulled Obi w/saber and R3 Quigon.  we both put on Combat Cards and try a combat.  and we can tell, this game is going to be a slow pinging each other to death.  problem is, my deck only has three destiny 7 cards because i have an irrational fear of Grimtaash and i don&#146;t like playing with cards that are only useful for their destiny number.  i prefer interrupts and effects that DO things.  anyway, in a combat i lose Lord Maul from my deck.  after dropping Maul in combat, he puts LSJK at the DB with Naked Threepio.  I drop a Trooper Garrison, R3 Fett, and i think Mara Jade, and wax him, but he covers it in forfeit and i have to lose it all because i&#146;m not dumb enough to leave a lone Trooper Garrison waiting for him to beat it down.  Lord Vader meanwhile is still being combated by QuiGon every turn, and on my turns i&#146;m targeting that stupid obi w/saber for combat since he has no combat cards ever.  i beat him a few times, but i can&#146;t kick him off the table.  finally i manage to get Emperor Palpatine down, just as Vader finally gets kicked off the table.  while he&#146;s trying to combat palpy, i drop a sidious somewhere else, and he&#146;s getting frustrated, plus i&#146;ve got Zuckuss at Carida and Battle Order out b/c now Padme and Panaka are sitting at the Core.  Now here&#146;s the part i can&#146;t quite remember.  I put Choke Vader in front of Panaka and Padme, and i think i initiated battle even though my obj was flipped b/c i never kicked that R3 Quigon off the table.  i remember checking my obj numerous times to make sure i wasn&#146;t doing anything illegal when i initiated battle, but i shouldn&#146;t have been able to battle panaka and padme there.  he tried to play their battle destiny adder, but i reminded him i get first action, and i choked padme so he couldn&#146;t play it, he shot Vader and i think i played Force Field, i drew battle destiny and he lost panaka and change.  why neither one of us caught my obvious error of initiating battle there, i don&#146;t know.  at the time, i was convinced it was legal.  crazy...anyway, i&#146;d already lost all 3 of my mauls, and i think Vader was the only thing keeping him flipped.  i finally found two of my 7&#146;s, stacked and tracked &#146;em, had &#146;em on top every stinking time, but he had the R3 saber on Quigon and two 7&#146;s of his own tracked every time.  SUCK!  we both managed to get our 7&#146;s stacked at the exact same time, so i came out the loser.  by 10.  He said that&#146;s usually how many cards he has in his lost pile by the end of the game...i mention that i&#146;ve finally realized that power of Strike Blocked and Blow Parried.<br />
Full Loss.  Score: 0 (-10).<br />
<br />
Game 2: My LS HB flip vs. Davis&#146;s DS LSC<br />
I never managed to find anyone who would loan me a Battle Plan shield, but Jason Herrin loaned me a Battle Plan combo effect so i started that instead of Menace Fades, so i could keep Chasm on the table b/c i know Jason and Davis aren&#146;t as concerned about playing with card doubles as I am...and Chasm rocks against decks that run 5 Vaders and 5 Mauls.  He starts IAO/SP and TPM.  which is odd...i&#146;ve never seen anyone start TPM in an LSC deck...its much more useful as a combat card.  he gets setup as fast as can be, while i&#146;m having trouble finding my systems.  he&#146;s using non-unique lightsabers to up his drains, which surprises me again.  i get the Asteroid Cave out but i&#146;m having trouble finding anybody to put there, i drop a Jedi beatdown on one of his guys at Theed and die to Combat the next turn.  i try to set up the Kessel/Rycar&#146;s Run combo for Leebo damage, but it takes me forever to get the Outrider out.  i&#146;m pretty confident that he&#146;s got absolutely no space since he&#146;s devoting so much to the combat, so i spread out and pay to drain as often as i can, but usually its just for 1 b/c i have a devil of a time flipping.  by the time i get big drains set up, he&#146;s so far ahead i have little chance....he just paid to drain all stinking game and knocked me out.  Plus i forgot to make him lose with Leebo a few times, and lose by 12.<br />
Full Loss. Score 0 (-22).<br />
<br />
Well its the break and thank goodness because i&#146;m starved.  Pizza&#146;s on the way (another of the many benefits of our Rebel Strike Team Wenatchee tournaments -- entry fee covers pizza), so i start a LOTR game with Casey Merry.  He starts R Gimli and his friend Farin.  he loads them with armor, moves, and i drop one nazgul which he dispatches.  clever me, i&#146;m holding two more and only dropped that one to give him false security...he moves to the Fords, and i drop Lemenya and Attea, and i&#146;ve got 2 black breaths waiting.  lemenya takes on Gimli, he plays all his strength cards to get ahead, but i drop a black breath and remind him Gimli&#146;s now str-2.  so Lemenya wins, Gimli&#146;s exhausted.  Attea, meanwhile, overwhelms Farin.  Attea&#146;s fierce...Attea overwhelms Gimli.  Casey can&#146;t believe it, but luckily he&#146;s takes it well, laughing at his own stupidity on the assignments...i move fine, he can&#146;t touch me, but i don&#146;t move far because i plan on killing his fellowship since it looks so easy.  well he slipped a Dwarf Guard into his fellowship, fooling both of us b/c he couldn&#146;t spot a dwarf.  plus somebody else, probably Aragorn.  he would move one, i would drop some nazgul on him and make him regret it.  eventually we noticed the dwarf guards were illegal so he lost both of them.  i had my fellowship up to full strength but i still only moved one site at a time because i was having fun with him...kinda mean, yeah, but it was fun.  pizza came, we ate while i pounded him...eventually we had to put the game away, but it was quite obvious that i was winning and would clean him out eventually.<br />
<br />
Game 3: My LS HBflip vs. some kid&#146;s AOBS<br />
He didn&#146;t start mob points and i was pretty surprised.  i figured maybe this was something like Sandy Drains BHBM so i got kinda spooked, but i figured i could win.  problem was, in an early drain i lost a system from my deck.  A system.  now i can&#146;t flip.  well he dropped a presence of the Force on the Imperial City, which was his last mistake...i dropped EPP Han with Life Debt in my hand, hoping he&#146;d battle me, but he didn&#146;t, he dropped Death Mark instead.  So i dropped an EPP Quigon and Luke on him and caused about 15 overflow.  meanwhile i&#146;m frantically looking for Kessel Run so i can get that system back.  he drops IG88 and a Destroyer Droid, but doesn&#146;t battle.  So now i know what i&#146;m up against...a newbie, or at least somebody with little real experience.  the store lady just handed out some BB premiere boosters for all of us that entered the tourney, so i decide i&#146;ll save mine and give it to him at the end of the game.  meanwhile i beatdown the two droids for another 15 force loss, complete a Kessel Run but my system is four more cards down so i give up flipping and just drain him out.  Win by 25, i hand him my starter and say i don&#146;t need the cards in it.  Later on i suggested he start Mob Points with that deck, and he said it wasn&#146;t his, he just borrowed it to play in the tourney.  i felt kinda low...but i tried to help him out during the game.<br />
Full Win.  Score: 2 (+3)<br />
<br />
Game 4: My LS HBflip vs. Tom Potter&#146;s TIE Swarm<br />
Apparently the store lady didn&#146;t quite get the command card thing figured out because i should have been playing my dark side.  Tom says he&#146;s borrowed this deck from Earl, so i figure it should be either half cheese or half played badly, and i&#146;m sitting pretty.  he starts Wakeelmui, and Twilek&#146;s Sienar Fleet Systems.  I&#146;m thinking what?  nevertheless, he plays Fear in his first turn.  Fear?!  Who plays Fear??  i lost two cards from hand, fearing a system from my reserve deck and a repeat of the no-flip, which would be suicide against TIEs.  Well i play my game, not paying much attention to him since his TIEs aren&#146;t doing anything.  he drops a TIE Vanguard at a system, and i say &quot;Oh, I think i&#146;ll battle that TIE when you have a lot of Force saved&quot; because of course we both know what&#146;s going on.  i eventually flip and get some damage going, but he drops the Death Star Assault Squadron at Aquaris against Leebo in the Outrider but doesn&#146;t init battle.  So i drop the Home One plus Ackbar, init battle, and he plays All Power To Weapons, adding 6 to his power.  we have equal power but nobody forfeits anything.  on his turn i think we did the same thing, but i lost Ackbar.  Then i deployed Dash, had a battle, he didn&#146;t have All Power, so i dropped his power by 6 with Dash and won the battle handily...but his forfeit covered it.  I eventually drained him out after that, but that Squadron had me scared for a while.  With my Hidden Base, once i lose a couple ships i&#146;m usually done for.  But i won, by 22 as i recall.<br />
Full Win.  Score: 4 (+25)<br />
<br />
They tallied the scores, got it all worked out, and here are the top few as far as i can recall, and my memory&#146;s not that good so don&#146;t get mad if i have your place wrong on here:<br />
<br />
 1. Earl (don&#146;t know his last name)<br />
 2. Alan Sutton from Yakima (i think he drove farther than me to play)<br />
 3. I don&#146;t remember...sorry.<br />
 4. ME!!  I got 4th after going 2-2...i couldn&#146;t believe it.  Prize for me was a box of Decipher&#146;s original crap Episode 1 CCG and another Premiere BB Starter, which i handed to Earl&#146;s son since I don&#146;t need any more Premiere.<br />
 5. Dennis Jeffris<br />
honorable mention: Davis and Jason, both came in somewhere around 8th as I recall.<br />
<br />
Looking at that, I realize my rating&#146;s not going to change much, since i didn&#146;t play against anybody who ended up higher than me.  So after my first official sanctioned tournament with ratings and everything, i&#146;m 2-2.  Not too impressive...but i&#146;ll take it.  better luck next time.<br />
<br />
Ok, time for the &quot;props and slops&quot; section...what does &quot;props&quot; mean, anyway?  I hate saying &quot;props&quot; to people, so i&#146;ll just go with highs and lows instead.<br />
<br />
Highs:<br />
-Winning two games.  Especially one against Tom Potter, who beat me with Hunt Down in one of my first tournaments there.<br />
-Seeing my name on a Command Card for the first time ever.<br />
-Getting the Witch King and Cave Troll as prizes for the LOTR game.<br />
-Wiping Casey&#146;s dwarves out with two Nazgul<br />
-1978 Chrysler LeBaron (I call her Libby) didn&#146;t break down<br />
-Dennis traded me a Obiwan w/saber, my first ever.<br />
-Jason traded me a Mara Jade, It&#146;s a Hit, and the Battle Plan combo<br />
-Seeing a great turn-out<br />
<br />
Lows:<br />
-losing my first two games.<br />
-only getting to play my Dark Side deck once.  Last tournament was so messed up i played light side in all 6 games.<br />
-last time i placed third.<br />
-my LSC deck really didn&#146;t perform well against another LSC...and i never got to play it against anything else to prove its a buttkicker.<br />
-not enough pizza...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was a whole lot of fun, and on top of that, I made it home without breaking down, so that was good.  Our next tournament is March 30th, it is Episode 1 Closed Environment, using Jason Herrin&#146;s Clone Wars Rules which you can find on the Articles section here on Decktech.  All our Wenatchee tournaments are advertised on the &lt;a href=http://www.decktech.net/43&gt;Rebel Strike Team webpage&lt;/a&gt;, so check it out and if you live in Washington State, join up!  We&#146;re going to start holding Lord of the Rings tournaments soon, in Wenatchee as well as Ellensburg (hopefully).  Thanks for reading...<br />
