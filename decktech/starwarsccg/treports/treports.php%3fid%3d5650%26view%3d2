-------------------<br />
<br />
Back in 2003, I teamed up with team KToD (Mike Gemme and Justin Desai) and Clint Hays at DragonCon, site of the 2003 SWCCG World Championships. We all made the top 8, I won and overall we were all happy with the joint venture.<br />
<br />
Since then I&#39;ve played on and off, mostly off, coming back to play some qualifiers and events in the summer time but not going to another Worlds. The title has bounced around to other people, landing with Nate Meeker last year. I&#39;ve moved around from Nashville to New York to St Louis and now back to New York, and in places with few people it&#39;s been hard to keep up my personal interest in the game.<br />
<br />
After leaving St Louis this June and moving back to NYC, for some reason I&#39;ve been pumped about getting back into the game. Maybe it&#39;s because of the new flexibility I have, not having to ask for time off from anybody to go to these events (I don&#39;t work anymore), or having people closer by to play with to stay sharp. In any case, Gemme and Desai recently came back to the game too, so we were in touch ever since Match Play last January (which I couldn&#39;t go to because of work) and had talked about reuniting 2003-style to retake the WC title from the hands of the New Schoolers.<br />
<br />
As usual I couldn&#39;t make many summer events but was able to go to PA States whenever it was during the summer season and place 3rd, behind Desai and Tim Simon, both of whom already had byes into Day 2. So step one of the process was complete.<br />
<br />
Step 2, the most important, was to study what I&#39;ve been missing over the last three+ years and learn what I had to learn. So I dove in with a vengeance and spent a lot of September reading Treports, talking to people about matchups and generally browsing the forums in search of information. Popular decks, many designed by Team Ohio, I had no idea about; I never saw CCT until Reid dominated me with it at PA States. So I had a lot of catching up to do since the last time I played, which was around the Redux.<br />
<br />
I made one trip in late August, prior to PA States, up to Boston to play some games with Gemme and Desai. I really had no idea about decks but had some good ones built, I thought; for dark, I was sporting a heavy space-package Fear deck with minimal red cards and a Cloud City tanks deck that was really solid. For light I already had no idea what to play. I thought with the new creature rules nobody would play creatures anymore, so maybe light spies would be dominant; a WYS spy deck was built (see Gemme&#39;s blog for the list) and it was okay. I took the tanks and WYS spies to PA states and did okay with them, but didn&#39;t like how either deck felt.<br />
<br />
September was a slow month for me work-wise (I freelance) so I had a lot of time to think about decks. I unearthed my old AoBS deck and modified it for what I thought was the current environment. I worked a bit more on Fear and was amazed that all 3 V14 preview cards are Fear helpers. Unbelievable. The CC Tanks was still solid. For light side, I must have spent 2-3 hours a day thinking and building decks in SWIP trying to come up with something that could hang with Fear in space and beat ground decks from Hunt Down to CCT to ROPs. Nothing was amazing. Most LS objective platforms had too many objectionable things: DBO was too slow; Code Clearance owns RTP; WHAP is too one-sided and doesn&#39;t have enough protection for beatdown or tricks; Hunt Down just owns QMC and Profit and WYS. For me, a light side deck had to be able to beat Fear and Hunt Down. That narrowed down my choices considerably.<br />
<br />
One notable event in my quest for a winning light side deck was browsing DDM&#39;s Decktech page. I&#39;ve never met him in person but he is so well known for his innovative ideas, I thought it&#39;d be worth the time. I came across his WYS Panic deck and was blown away by the simplicity and elegance of it. I built it, changed about 5 cards, and it felt good. A little gimmicky, but it could beat Fear and a variety of ground decks. So that was a start.<br />
<br />
Aaron Kingery and I were in communication after PA States. We talked about good activation platforms and came up with a HB mains platform that pulled Aquaris, Endor, and Alderaan V by turn 2, getting 11 force and giving up only 1. That seemed good. We passed deck ideas back and forth and came up with a good deck. Essentially, it is a hit-and-run Senate style deck with incredibly high destinies (lots of 6s and 5s) and a good space package of Luke and Jek to retrieve 2 a turn to offset Search and Destroy. The deck is solid but it couldn&#39;t beat Fear, so I built it as a backup deck but didn&#39;t want to use it for Worlds, where I knew some of the top players would definitely play it beyond a shadow of a doubt (lots of posturing and bs on the forums confirmed it for me).<br />
<br />
I went up to Boston a second time to PT again, this time with Lee Edwards joining us. We really didn&#39;t come up with anything new this time around but got some good practice games in. I must have played Desai a half dozen times with Fear vs his light Senate, among dozens of other games. It built up some good confidence. There&#39;s nothing like playing matchups over and over and trying to do different things to get an edge in the matchup, and to play with some of the best players available is invaluable. Gotta stress these trips to Boston as being key to shaking off all the rust and sharpening my skills.<br />
<br />
The week before Worlds, I went home to Albany to test with my friends there, Aaron and Matt Sokol and Joe Giannetti. It was there Joe came up with this first turn EBO setup which Aaron then refined. We thought of doing it first off the HB platform but then nixed it for a Hoth Careful Planning start. First it had clouds to play Han&#39;s Toolkit off of vs Fear and not worry about the beatdown; we struggled with the ground package because so many cards were dedicated to space. Its early incarnations already did well against Fear so I thought it had promise, but it was too close to Worlds and the deck had a lot of problems. The WYS Panic really tested well in Albany so that was what I was going to use Day 2. My first choice for dark was Fear. The Tanks didn&#39;t feel great and the Agents got beat up twice by Aaron&#39;s HB Mains so I was discouraged.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORLDS, FRIDAY 10/5<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Friday rolled around and I caught the bus to go to LGA to catch my flight. The more I thought about it, the more I didn&#39;t like the WYS Panic. It was too random. I could easily topdeck 3 interrupts in a crucial Panic and then get beat down. So the entire trip I was busy thinking up wild LS ideas.<br />
<br />
When the plane landed in Chicago O&#39;Hare, I had concocted what became my Day 2 LS deck: an EBO that focused strictly on space. As my guide I used a resolution I had made in Albany: I would not lose to Brian Hunter at Worlds. This is not posturing or smack talk; I really didn&#39;t care if I went 1-3 with LS as long as I didn&#39;t lose to Hunter. Call it a rivalry, or being peeved at his random listmaking; in any case, I was convinced he would play Fear because of his recent influence on the Design team guiding all the erratas away from Fear. SO I needed a deck that would beat Fear. Not an easy endeavor.<br />
<br />
The EBO I came up with was inspired by Joe&#39;s idea but I took out all the ground. Why bother with a few token EPPs when you have no bullet cards for all the possible matches? No anti-barriers, no anti-dueling, no anti-Hidden Weapons or Overload or Stunning Leader... etc etc. So how about no EPPs? That seemed logical (I don&#39;t know if it is). I toyed with It&#39;s A Traps but why bother with that too? Crix and Arconas got scrapped for more Xwings. Alternatives to Fighting seemed good. It Can Wait seemed good. The deck was built despite Desai and Gemme&#39;s initial reaction that it was a jank pile. After testing a little bit in the hotel room, it was decided it had a lot of potential but still was janky. Oh well. It beat Fear.<br />
<br />
Around 6:30 or so the Team Tournament started. I was going to team with Brian Fred but he was stuck in traffic so I teamed with Lee Edwards instead. He used my Fear deck, which is based on a design by Steven Lewis he sent me over a year ago, but has changed little. I played WYS Panic. I beat two DS Combat decks and lost to Reid playing his CCT and Justin Desai playing his Hunt Down. The HD game was one of the worst games of my life. He started First Strike and dropped a first turn Vader at the Cantina. I did the customary RFC RFC Medium Bulk Freighter to flip. I had a Houjix and a Panic in my hand and was feeling confident... until he pointed at First Strike. Oops. EPP Maul came down, Crossfire left play and after all was said and done the RFC and half my deck were in my lost pile. I lost that game by 40. It&#39;s hard to lose by 40 but it can be done.<br />
<br />
We ended up going 4-4. Gemme and Desai won and got these awesome-looking glass beer mugs. Early props to whoever made the decisions on prizes. Those &quot;custom mugs&quot; were way cooler than anything I thought they could be.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORLDS, SATURDAY 10/6<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t decide on my decks. Fear was just such a broken deck, and all the counters were so terrible. But I didn&#39;t like that it won by <20 a lot of the time so I went with Agents instead, thinking I could get big wins with it via Scum.<br />
<br />
For light, I really waffled. WYS Panic I didn&#39;t like because I knew by turn 3 that I would win the game, or I knew I would lose. There&#39;s not much control built into the deck. HB Mains was another option, but as I said earlier, it got beat by Fear and that didn&#39;t go well with my rule of not losing to Hunter. So I scrapped that. I didn&#39;t have the confidence to play LS Senate, nor was I convinced it could beat Fear consistently. So really, my only choice was that weird groundless EBO deck I came up with on the plane ride to Chicago. A month + of thinking, planning and playtesting and I play a deck I built the night before? A recipe for disaster.<br />
<br />
We showed up at the store and there were a lot of people there. The final count came to 43 players in Day 2. Lots of old faces, lots of new ones. People seemed pretty anxious/excited to play. Forgive me if I get some names wrong or differential wrong, but this is what I remember:<br />
<br />
Game 1: LS vs Brad Eier&#39;s CCT<br />
<br />
This game went badly from the beginning. Brad put down Lando and IG-88 and Despair but didn&#39;t pick up Jabba&#39;s Prize. I was asking whether IG drew destiny and what his gun did and stuff and I think I got him worried about a possible beatdown; he didn&#39;t move over to the Carbonite Chamber until a little later. Unfortunately, after I activated my first 7 force and deployed Rieekan to search for the Echo Corridor to get my EBO set up, it was in my active pile. So EBO was delayed one turn. Next turn, I got the Echo Corridor with A New Secret Base gametext and used Mothma to get either Sullust or Endor... but they were both in my active pile of 9 cards. Amazing. So I got EBO set up and rolling by turn... 3. That&#39;s terrible, in a matchup that requires me to drain for as much as possible as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
So my first drain came on turn 4 and by then I had lost drains of 2 every turn at the security tower, and more importantly, he had used IG a bunch of times. When I had Xwings out at Sullust and Endor and Hoth, he had Tat Maul and Ship in hand and cut off one of my drains. He also had the carbonite chamber, the audience chamber and Resistance out. It went downhill from there. I really had no chance after turn 2 to win this game, and he didn&#39;t let me back in it.<br />
<br />
FL -19<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: DS vs Jeffery &quot;Reegesk&quot; Johns&#39; Naboo mains<br />
<br />
Despite my game sucking, it was fun to play Brad cuz he&#39;s easygoing and friendly. Jeffery was also really fun to play with. I set up pretty quick in this game with Xizor, Guri and Lando I think at the Coruscant DB since he gave me a load of force to begin with, starting the 3/2 Naboo site and Naboo with Careful Planning V. His turn, he came down with Quigon and pulled his Saber to the 3/2 site. I put down Vigo, Greedo, Jodo Kast from reserve and Bossk with Mortar gun from hand to the 3/2 site, checked my destinies and indeed a 2 or 3 was on top. One Hidden Weapons later, Quigon was captured. He tried to set up in space with Dash but Zuckuss and 4Lom came down and took that out. Basically everything he tried to do I had an answer for. In the meanwhile, I really had no lost pile to speak of because of Scum and Reegesk had stolen 6 or 7 cards which made their way into my deck via Vengeance of the Dark Prince. So at the end of the game, I had basically all those cards deployed and no hand and 6 or 7 of his cards all in my deck. He thought Reegesk V stealing cards from Reegesk was pretty hilarious, and I thought so too.<br />
<br />
FW +39<br />
Total: 2 + 20<br />
<br />
Game 3: DS vs Mike Pistone&#39;s mains<br />
<br />
Pistone started Boss Nass&#39;s chambers and It Is The Future You See and I was worried because he had beaten me with a similar mains deck at Maryland a year or so ago. I had more experience now and was less rusty than then but still, mains is the toughest matchup for AoBS. I didn&#39;t like it.<br />
<br />
He put down Red Squadron 7 x2 on It Is The Future You See and I felt bad for him to have felt compelled to play two terrible counters for a deck he virtually couldn&#39;t beat. Author&#39;s note #1: I hate Fear. What a crappy card. <br />
<br />
The game progressed really carefully. I moved Xizor to the Coruscant DB as early as I could safely; he had Jodo, Guri, Lando and Bossk as his guards by turn 3 or 4. Meanwhile Pistone had Threepio out quick but nothing else really; he kept Threepioing to set up his hand and drawing a few cards here and there. At one point he drew above 12 and I monnoked him used to set him back a few turns. I also put out Ability^3 to put some pressure on him. At some point he put down Rep Been and Boss Nass to activate more; I elis&#39;d over, captured Boss Nass and absolutely beat the piss out of Rep Been. That ended that game abruptly. Pistone was a great sport about it; I actually think he thought the whole thing was hilarious. He had a few more cards left and it took a few turns of draining to finish it; in the meantime Reegesk stole a bunch of lightsabers and I put my hand back in my deck.<br />
<br />
FW +38<br />
Total: 4+58<br />
<br />
Game 4: LS vs Chris Menzel&#39;s ROPs<br />
<br />
I had never tested against a ROPs so I was a little worried. Chris is an old friend from Germany; we met at Neutral Ground years ago, probably 5 years ago? randomly for an event that never happened and played a bunch of pickup games. Then I was on a tour in Germany and passed through Braunsweig which is close to where he lives, so we met up and played some more games. So it was great to see Chris again. <br />
<br />
His first turn he dropped a couple of sites, activated a bunch and drew some cards. He gave me a lot of force so I set up EBO first turn, dropped an Xwing at Hoth and moved it over to Ralltir to prevent him from flipping. Little good it did, as he dropped 4 guys to 4 different Ralltir sites, activated a bunch more and then dropped space Vader on Vader&#39;s Shuttle at Ralltir. Flip and battle; my power 7 Xwing (Incom + EBO power bonus) died along with a few cards. After some deliberation, he moved the shuttle to Hoth in front of my lone Xwing there.<br />
<br />
I came down semi-hard with a couple of Xwings and killed off Vader. He monnoked me (I had 8 cards in hand) and got nothing. He saw I had no Xwings in my hand so he played Baron in the shuttle across from my Xwing and drew up. Before he could end his turn, I Organized Attack&#39;d lost and got 3 Xwings, and they came down along with Gold Leader in GOld 1 (v) and beat the crap out of Baron and the Shuttle. He had to topdeck over 12 cards and that was the big event of the game. The rest of the game I managed to flip him back and drain and steal a win of 21 in a game I probably had no business winning.<br />
<br />
FW 2 +21<br />
Total: 6 +79<br />
<br />
So by now I had ridiculous diff and a much-coveted win with my light side deck. Woohoo! Mike was also 3-1, Desai was cruising at 4-0 and the remaining undefeateds were thinning out.<br />
<br />
Game 5: DS vs Brian Fred&#39;s WYS Raiders<br />
<br />
Fred was pessimistic about this game from the get-go, having experienced a beating at the hands of Shaw last year or the year before or something. I was still cautious, quick-flipping with Xizor and some guy to the Coruscant DB and the Emperor to the Cantina by turn 3. Early on he flipped with Melas and a Raider/craft at two different Tatooine DBs. As he was setting up space, I came down with two Vigos in front of the patrol craft and some other guys in front of Melas. He had one force saved, so I played Broken Concentration, put his force back on top of Reserve, and played First Strike to stop the Fallen Portal (turns out he didn&#39;t have it anyways). Unfortunately I was noobish and battled Melas first not realizing the craft reacted for free. He reacted the craft, drew his destinies, and attrition wiped out the site anyway while I lost some random forfeit huge guy. Reegesk was stealing all kinds of ships and vehicles and a little later Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with 4Lom + forfeit went to Tatooine and killed off Luke/ship. Artoo in Red 5 got stolen and was deployed at a DB. I took a couple drains of 2 at Kessel (Resistance) and was dealing out a ton of damage via drains, Vengeance damage, etc. At one point I monnoked lost and got 3 patrol crafts. I gave his hand back to him and he looked at me funny and asked if I wanted to get rid of his two palace raiders, too. Oops. One was foil and looked different. Nice tech. Fred is a champ and I felt bad for squeezing every last differential out of him.<br />
<br />
FW +36<br />
Total 8+ 115<br />
<br />
Desai won his game and so did Gemme. Team KToD + Chu were looking good. So was Lee Edwards&#39; fantasy team (Team KToD + Chu)<br />
<br />
Game 6: LS vs Phil Aasen&#39;s DS Combat<br />
<br />
I felt like a total noob because I gave Steve Lewis my light side Ultimatum shield the day before and forgot to plug in my extra in my own deck. So I was running without a crucial card. In Eier&#39;s matchup I would have saved 4-8 cards with it and I was worried I would need it for this matchup too. He was podracing (!!!!) with Blaster Rack V as his effect. The podrace was off, and he put down Lord Maul with Double-bladed at the 3/2 site. Ouch. He gave me a ton of force so I got the first turn EBO down and moved the Xwing at the DB up to Hoth. I had to match his drains to have a shot. Battle Plan, he drained for 4 and deployed Vader to the 2/2. Out came Affect Mind shield, woohoo! At least I could get away without playing Ultimatum now. This game became a drain slugfest. I had one Xwing each at my three systems (Sullust and Endor besides Hoth) draining at first for 9, then 6 after he put Emperor down at the 4th marker to hold Resistance. He was draining for 4 and had Search and Destroy out pretty quickly. But I had to pay more for my drain. I drew into Corran Horn and at one point Monnoked him to see what he had to back up either Vader or the Emperor. He had Mara, and a Stunning Leader. So no Vader, but I could go down to the Emperor to hold off S&D for a turn and hopefully drain for free one turn. And I had a barrier for Mara, which he anticipated. So he battled during his turn, used Crossfire to add a destiny, and... drew a 0 and a 1. Corran lives! Because of Xwings at the system and Rieekan at the War Room, I had power 10 to his 5 and he forfeited the Emperor to cover the damage. So I had an advantage.<br />
<br />
I drained for free for 10 and was feeling pretty good. He activated 12, drained for 4, and played Mara, who I barriered to the fourth marker. The podrace finished and he said, &quot;move phase?&quot; and I was like OK and he said &quot;the podrace finishes?&quot; and I was like OK and he said &quot;lose 6&quot; and I realized I didn&#39;t have Traffic Control V out (I thought I did). Big oops. But he was cool and let me play it, which was a huge testament to what a cool kid he is, especially in such a close game. So he retrieved his 6 and it was looking awfully close, but I thought I had the advantage for sure. So I drained for 6 and deployed Leia (v) to the podrace arena to make sure I had Battle Plan, and drew. FOR SOME REASON I DIDN&#39;T BATTLE MARA. Wtf? I totally forgot about Resistance. Not very good playing on my part. He drained for 4 and in a tech move, moved Maul away from the 3/2 site where he had played Security Precautions (v) (my card!!) to put it back in used pile. Tech!! He was down to 11 cards; I drained for 7; he was down to 4; he drained me out. Really close game. I wish I had a) gotten out Imperial Atrocity (v) with Don&#39;t Do That Again shield or b) battled Mara or c) been able to retrieve with All Wings Report In. But I didn&#39;t, didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t, and he won a close game and was a great sport about the podrace. <br />
<br />
FL -4<br />
Total:8 +111<br />
<br />
Desai had to play Gemme and lost. So now they were both 5-1 and I was 4-2, but feeling pretty confident because I only had one more light game left and only needed to win one more game to advance because of my crazy diff.<br />
<br />
Game 7: DS vs Phil Aasen&#39;s WYS<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t too happy to have to play Phil again because he played a great game before, but the matchup was in my favor and he didn&#39;t seem to have seen AoBS before by the way he was reading the objective. So, that was encouraging. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I don&#39;t remember much about the game. I was exhausted at this point and knew I had to play safe but aggressive and make sure to get the win. So I flipped as fast as I could, did the normal Emperor to the Cantina and stacked up at the Tatooine DB as well. Establish Control (v) was netting me a ton of activation. He set up in space as normal and I came down with Zuckuss and 4 Lom and forfeit and killed some guys. Reegesk was stealing cards. At one point he came down with Chewie&#39;s ATST but I cleared the guys piloting it with attrition. He never got his deck going right because I was basically killing things as soon as they hit the table; WYS is basically an auto-loss for Agents. But he played it tough and hung in there until the very end.<br />
<br />
FW +10<br />
Total: 10+121<br />
<br />
So I was guaranteed top 8 by virtue of diff. Nice. Desai lost to Hunter and Gemme beat Tom Hollingsworth. So Gemme was a pretty 6-1, and Desai and I each had 2 losses but had sick diff. <br />
<br />
Game 8: LS vs Brian Hunter&#39;s Fear<br />
<br />
Hunter had spent the last two-three months on the forums, both publicly and privately in Design team/playtester chat, decrying how Fear was not too strong and should not need an errata and how there were so many good counters for it and basically being its only champion as others, including myself, tried to get it knocked down a rung. It all seemed a little sketchy since he played the deck in tournaments and, being a good player, obviously knew how strong the deck was. I mean, I can&#39;t name any other card that can dish out as much damage as safely as Fear. So despite all the bs on the forums, I was pretty confident he would play Fear so, as I mentioned earlier, I had to build a deck to beat it so I could complete my objective of not losing to Brian Hunter in this tournament. So as unconfident as I was in my EBO deck, this was one matchup I knew I could win.<br />
<br />
He gave me a bunch of Drops on his turn as he did the basic pull a system-pull a site-pull Merrejk-pull a system deal. He even got Bewil down first turn. I did my first turn EBO and began moving around Xwings to get in big drains and block his Fear damage. I drew into good cards this game - got my Rebel Fleet down early, Wokling&#39;d for Incom Corp, and had Alternatives and Hyper Escape and Barriers in my hand. I even drew into my It Can Wait. At one point I had 12 cards in my hand and he monnoked me, but got nothing. There was a lot of maneuvering and battling in this game, but there was little he could do - my deck was 58 cards of anti-Hunter. It does little good to Overwhelm an Xwing and two of my ships are power 11 before destiny and cost me 2. At one point I grimtaash&#39;d lost and got a bunch of Control/Set For Stuns and a couple of Barriers too. More importantly, I saw he had Thrawn and Sidious in his hand and I waited for him to lose them to drains/deploy Thrawn on a ship before I DB Transited Mon Mothma over to the Death Star to get free drains. Free drains = good.<br />
<br />
FW +18<br />
Final result: 12 +139<br />
<br />
I ended up in first, with Desai finishing next in diff. Angelo won his last game against Phil to finish 7th and knock Phil out of contention diff; Brad Eier also won his last game by 44 to edge Brandon Schele out of the top 8.<br />
<br />
The top 8 were:<br />
<br />
1) Me<br />
2) Justin Desai<br />
3) Brian Hunter<br />
4) Mike Gemme<br />
5) Tom Hollingsworth, the most undervalued 2007 fantasy player<br />
6) Brian Fred<br />
7) Angelo Consoli<br />
8) Brad Eier<br />
<br />
6 oldschool players! A great top 8.<br />
<br />
Six of us (Gemme, Desai, me, Tom, Lee Edwards and Mark ??) went to TGIF across the street from the hotel to eat a late dinner. Gemme busted out his team tourney custom mug and was making the moves on our 19-year old waitress. As he went to get his mug from the car she called him a faggety wookie before eventually giving him her phone number and meeting up with him the next day. Nice progression! In the meanwhile, I pondered decks.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORLDS, SUNDAY 10/7<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
I really didn&#39;t sleep much that night, trying to think of a light deck to play. WYS Panic felt bad during the team tourney. EBO got beat by CCT and I thought Brad Eier would play that for sure in Day 3. Plus I figured people knew I had no ground package at all so they would just play like random guy to any battleground site and drain all game. I thought about HB Mains cuz it&#39;s just a solid deck but it still couldn&#39;t beat Fear and I thought Hunter would play that for sure. So I had, in effect, no deck.<br />
<br />
Sokol called me at 7 am to wish me good luck and we talked about decks. Gemme and Desai woke up and we talked about decks. As I was laying out the EBO Desai threw me his Senate and convinced me to play it. I had it built with a bunch of different cards but never playtested with it. Desai plays it better than anyone I know and he has had years with running Senate decks, especially dark side, but even though I had played their dark Senate before it just seemed like an entirely different deck than the light. But I couldn&#39;t argue with reason; that really was the best light deck available, had a chance against every deck, could not got rolled by any deck, and would have close losses if it lost at all. After my Agents rolled in Day 2, this seemed like both a safe bet and a risky play. After nearly a month of thinking and playtesting, I was playing a light deck in each day I really didn&#39;t know that well.<br />
<br />
But I had confidence I knew how the deck was supposed to play - I had tested against Desai a billion times - and I had the master himself to pepper with scenario questions. So armed with the best light deck and a guru, disdainful of Chu tech as he was, I felt good going into the day.<br />
<br />
Onto the games. I chose DS in each of my matches.<br />
<br />
Match 1, vs Brad Eier<br />
--<br />
Game 1, AoBS vs Profit.<br />
<br />
Profit! Profit?! I don&#39;t think it was that bad of a choice. He started Saitorr and could potentially get down Master Luke for free, with Saber, and Leia or Chewie or whoever and beat the hell outta whoever I started in the AC. It also has potential against Fear. But it was a bit surprising. I was confident, though, because I tested against a great Profit deck played by Mike Gemme and won both games.<br />
<br />
I started Lando Calrissian (v) and Boba Fett (v) in the AC and saw I activated the Coruscant DB. So I deployed Ket Maliss from hand and got The Emperor (V) from deck with Info Exchange (or the other way around, Ket from deck and The Emperor from hand, I forget) to the Audience Chamber to delay or thwart a beatdown. I then bulked up the Coruscant DB next turn with Jodo Kast, Xizor and Guri non-V and flipped. Things were feeling pretty good.<br />
<br />
Then they turned bad. He bulked up the Tat: JP with Leia, Rebel Princess and Anakin&#39;s Lightsaber V, Threepio with parts, and Padme. Next, Master Luke with saber and I&#39;m With you Too (v). Ugh. He then added Mace Windu and saber. So by this point I was on the 0 side of the objective with little chance of capturing Luke without getting raped; I was draining for 1 and he was doing 2 Padme damage. Not good. Not only did I need to win, I had no experience with Senate so I wanted to win big. In desperation I played Zuckuss in Mist Hunter + 4Lom to Coruscant with a Presence of the Force. He Altered, I sensed, he sensed, I grabbed his sense and sensed and he didn&#39;t resense. So he played SAC too. Great. So Presence stayed out. I also think I played Ability^3 but I forget. Anyways, I was really hoping he would Nabrun Leids over to the AC; I drew into Oota goota solo and really wanted to win the game with that card. But, instead, he moved all his guys inside the old-fashioned way.<br />
<br />
But unfortunately for Brad, he chose a bad time to do it. I had been peeking in my deck trying in vain to catch a moment with only high destinies in there and when he moved in I knew I had a 5 on top. So I zapped Master Luke with the Emperor and stole his saber. Then, after recirculating (and flipping the objective), I zapped Leia Rebel Princess with the same destiny. Then I did drain/objective damage, peeked at my force pile, and saw First Strike, Zuckuss and Emperor as my top three cards. So I used three and deployed Dr E or somebody somewhere and drew up some cards. I recirculated, and after his first action I overloaded Mace and made the destiny a 0 with Lando. So in one turn, Master Luke with saber and IWYT, Leia with saber and Mace with saber all hit the lost pile, I was flipped to side 7 and things went from bad to good.<br />
<br />
He placed Seeking out of play and took Luke back into hand and we played back and forth a few more turns; but Reegesk had stolen the weapons and the threat had passed. He flipped and did some damage but I killed Han the next turn and soon the game was done.<br />
<br />
FW +22<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS Senate vs Hunt Down<br />
<br />
I was happy to see this matchup cuz all I had to do was keep Vader off the table (or a Jedi at a battleground) and Visage would do all the damage for me. First turn he came down to the Blockade Flagship DB with Blizzard 4 and Vader and reinforced it with the Emperor and Emperor&#39;s Power (v) soon after. Ugh. In the meantime, I wasn&#39;t activating for Wokling cuz I am a noob. So I was off to a slow start. He also started No Escape so I had Honor in my hand but it was worthless, so I tossed it to Visage. I was careful not to topdeck while my political effects were in my deck, and the early turns were tough through Visage damage while he wasn&#39;t taking any. But he wasn&#39;t draining at all because I flipped relatively early and got Plea to the Court down. So I wasn&#39;t too worried.<br />
<br />
I got the Hovercam down eventually and the four political effects, and began the process of killing Vader. Luke EPP came down to the DB and battled the two Dark Jedi and vehicle. I tried to hit the Emp but Luke got force-fielded; uh oh. Eier also played I Have You Now. So this was a bad-looking scenario, but the LS Senate is such a beast! He drew a 6, which I added/subtracted; then a 0 and a 1, or some other low destinies (I don&#39;t remember). I drew a 5 or a 6, which I added to. So his Vader + Emp + Bliz + 3 destinies = 22 power while I had Luke = 19 or so power. How good is that? Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t hit the Emperor but I ended Emperor&#39;s Power damage, flipped him back for a turn, and did 1 damage with DTF. WOohoo. Oh yeah, and Resilienced Luke.<br />
<br />
We did this a couple more times. I managed to keep him flipped for most of the game. I put down the 3/2 site at some point and COrran Horn there and he came down with Maul but I took no damage because he went Used. Nothing else really happened; he would put Vader down, and I would kill him, and we would take Visage damage, and I would cancel his drains. Eventually he won - I lost too many senators and wasn&#39;t causing any damage other than Visage and the occasional hit and run - but it was by 9 or 11 or something and after mid-game we both knew it was just a matter of time.<br />
<br />
FL 9 or 11 or something<br />
<br />
So I advanced. Tom upset Gemme, Fred upset Hunter and Desai came back to beat Angelo after losing game 1. <br />
<br />
Match 2 vs Tom Hollingsworth<br />
------<br />
Game 1: AoBS vs LS Combat<br />
<br />
I had played Tom in NJ States and probably some other East Coast events over the last few years and he always did well. I remembered one game with the AoBS vs his WYS (v) Speeders where I stole like 10 speeders and accidentally illegally deployed them all over his planet because I forgot I couldn&#39;t deploy cards with ability other than Black Sun Agents. But, the point was, he knew the deck and he knew how to beat it.<br />
<br />
I flipped quick with some mofs (including Lando), played the Blockade Flagship Bridge, played Establish Control (v). He drew a few cards. I bunkered with Guri and threw back Reegesk to peek at Force Pile. In retrospect that was a mistake; I really should have expected his next move and thrown back the Emperor or Zuckuss or some destiny one card, because I could track it around and Overload since I was activating a bazillion cards. But instead, I didn&#39;t; he played Jedi Luke with Saber, I&#39;m With You Too (V) and Bionic Hand (V), as well as Entrenchment (v) to the 3/2 site. I gulped and prepared to stay flipped on the 0 side the whole game. I mean, that is about as tanked as Luke will ever get.<br />
<br />
So at this point I had no idea how to proceed. I knew he was playing the card that cancels Overload and Hidden Weapons, and I thought he might be playing SAC. How to get around Entrenchment? I drew like crazy and he drained for 3. I went down with the Emperor to the 2/2 and bulked it up a little; he flipped so he couldn&#39;t drain. He came down with Quigon and his destiny 5 (7) saber, which I Overloaded, and combat&#39;d the emperor away. I came down with a ton more random guys, including 4lom, and battled to retrieve the Emperor and some other cards and tried to cancel Quigons gametext but was thwarted by his gametext. Oops again. Oh well - I don&#39;t even know if he took overflow. But I didn&#39;t have to lose much. He finger of death&#39;d 4Lom and dropped Obiwan with Quigon&#39;s saber and battled; I played Hidden Weapons and randomly drew my only 6 destiny, Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator, to make Obiwan immediately lost. He then moved Quigon away, to Luke&#39;s site.<br />
<br />
I realized I had to track that 6 destiny with my life. It was my only ticket to winning the game - with that 6, I had a bunch of different ways to kill Luke. To track it, I had to give up my many different searches (Accelerate, Info Exchange, Ket Maliss, Unexpected) but it was necessary. I restacked the 2/2 site with more random guys and dropped the Emperor again to keep him on the 7 side and not drain. He was forced to move Quigon over and I eventually killed him at the cost of another dead Emperor (but not before he Disarmed Bossk with Mortar Gun). In that battle, he had to topdeck a lot of cards including Maces and Obiwans and things so I was feeling OK about his attack force - he was running moderately low on force and I thought I had a shot, as long as I could keep him flipped or kill Luke. So I deployed the Emperor again, to join the random guys including Bossk with Mortar Gun (Disarmed) and IG-88 with gun. He moved Luke over to combat (really no choice, cuz he was dealing no damage flipped) and made me topdeck 2. My plan was to capture him with IG but then he Disarmed him during my control phase. So I had two Disarmed guys and a bunch of random aliens against a huge Tank luke that can cancel destinies. Desperate, I used Broken Concentration, played Dr E combo to use more force, and played Twi&#39;lek Advisor (v)... and found Boba Fett (v) in my used pile. I knew he was around somewhere, but it was a minor stroke of luck and I deploye him for free happily and captured Luke with the 6 destiny. Game over. Flipped, I threw my hand back into my deck to jack the diff.<br />

FW +21<br />
<br />
Whew.<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS Senate vs Hunt Down<br />
<br />
After the game with Brad I had consulted Desai as to what to do vs Hunt Down. He suggested getting out Endor as quickly as possible and throwing down Corran and ship out there to deal some damage while hit-and-running Vader. So that was my game plan this game.<br />
<br />
Instead of docking bays, Tom played the Back Door, but he could never get any good guys out as fast as Eier did. The Emperor came down first turn and we both suffered Visage. I flipped quickly and pulled the Hovercam soon after, along with Endor with Mon Mothma. Vader came down turn 2 or 3 but he never deployed/couldn&#39;t find Emperor&#39;s Power so his damage was limited to Visage. Luke and Jedis came down and killed Vader a couple of times. After the second or third killing I caused a bunch of overflow and it was pretty obvious there wasn&#39;t much he could do. I don&#39;t really remember the details of this game but it was pretty one-sided; Desai&#39;s deck worked just like it should. I knocked Tom below 21 diff and he picked up.<br />
<br />
FW +?<br />

Desai beat Fred to set up the final match.<br />

Final confrontation: vs Justin Desai<br />

Game 1: AoBS vs LS Senate<br />
<br />
We had tested this match three or four times before and I think it slightly favors AoBS. Senate has the tools to win but between the force choke and the tricks, AoBS controls the pace of the game. I flipped pretty quickly, maybe turn 2, to the DB with Xizor, Guri non-V, Lando and Reegesk or someone. I was being careful not to over-commit to any one site, saving guys for the inevitable 3/2 Naboo site. He flipped first turn and set up his political effects. To my surprise, he came down early with Luke EPP and Artoo in Red 5 to Endor, maybe turn 3, I think. I deployed Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, 4Lom (just for forfeit - he had Horox Ryder out to limit destinies), Vigo in Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator and Greedo as a passenger in Zuckuss. Battled, but couldn&#39;t draw a destiny high enough to pop his immunity even with the +3 to forfeit. He came down with Han Chewie Falcon and battled but I didn&#39;t draw destiny so he had to place him out of play and all I lost was 4Lom and Greedo and some overflow maybe. I came back down with a bunch more random guys and broke his immunity this time, so Luke went lost; I Sensed a Resilience to bury him. <br />
<br />
After surviving/bulking up space, I felt the game was going my way and I just had to hold on. One turn I monnoked him and didn&#39;t get anything, but saw he had EPPs Luke, Obi and Quigon, and Corran Horn and the 3/2 site. So next turn he deployed Luke, Obi, and Quigon to the 3/2 site to flip me back and cause some damage but I had an answer: I played Presence of the Force on his 3/0 site and deployed Emperor, Boba and Vigo or some random guy there and persona-replaced Guri to Guri (v). So now I had drains of 2, 5 and 1 and had enough bgs for Resistance. I also played Ability^3 which got Corran out of his hand and allowed me to eventually spread to the 1/0 Coruscant site to get an additional drain. He never actually lost 5 to the drain, canceling it every turn, but the little pockets of damage did him in. When I got him down to 1 force left, I elis&#39;d to the senate and battled, retrieving 3 for Scum/DTF just to jack up the diff a bit more.<br />
<br />
FW +16<br />
<br />
In my mind, a win by +16 was nothing against Desai. Nothing less than 20 something was a safe margin. Plus, he was playing against his own deck, which he knew inside out. My basic gameplan was the same: keep Vader off the table and let Visage do the rest.<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS Senate vs Hunt Down<br />
<br />
Luckily I had two games to hone my skill against this matchup. He played the Back Door and drew some cards. I drew a great hand - a ton of senators and Amidala - but couldn&#39;t flip first turn because he started Ability^3 (v). So he played Vader, and I flipped my second turn too, deploying Endor for force, and started to get out the political effects. His turn, he came down with EPP Maul in the Senate vs Mothma and Horox Ryder. He ditched Crossfire but was unlucky and didn&#39;t draw enough destiny to clear the Senate. Mothma died along with Maul but I played another next turn and Senator Palpatine to lock down the flip. All the political effects hit the table and I started to hit and run like in Tom&#39;s game. I didn&#39;t draw great destinies a couple of times but in one battle I drew Honor for destiny and took it into hand with Mothma&#39;s game text; that saved me maybe 4-5 force and I was able to keep him flipped for a while. Eventually Corran Horn in his ship went to Endor and I was able to get a couple of drains of 4 at the Back Door. This game was pretty one-sided as Desai&#39;s Senate deck did everything it was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
FW +6<br />
<br />
So I won the thing and Desai finished second. Between our two World Championships we teamed for, Team KToD and I (and Clint for the first one) are a combined 7/7 for Day 3 and two championships. That is a successful partnership.<br />
<br />
Props and Slops:<br />
<br />
HUGE PROPS:<br />
--Henry and Nate for running everything at this event. It was run really, really well. They handled questions smoothly and kept things moving along. Really impressive.<br />
--Team KToD for teaming and playtesting. In both 2003 and this year, I wouldn&#39;t have won anything without their decks, their advice and the beatings they applied during playtesting. (But I made my own deck contributions too princesses!) Also thanks to Lee Edwards for playtesting and borrowed cards.<br />
--Team Albany for their playtesting and decks and support. Between every game I&#39;d send/get text messages and would talk about upcoming possible matches. They couldn&#39;t be there in person but their support was felt 1000 miles away.<br />
--Phil Aasen for letting me play Traffic Control (v), and giving me his DS Combat deck to look at overnight before Day 3. It&#39;s always good to meet people I haven&#39;t met before and I was really impressed by his deck + playing. Watch out for this guy. He&#39;s going to win it soon.<br />
--Dave McCune for playtesting<br />
--The PC for making Reegesk (V). He stole 25+ cards over the two days. That&#39;s 25+ diff for free!<br />
--The taxi driver who charged us $28 to get to the airport<br />
<br />
SLOPS:<br />
--The PC for not errata&#39;ing Fear Will Keep Them In Line (v). Slops to everyone involved in stopping Fear from being errata&#39;d. Come on. This card is stupid. Read the forums for all the reasons why this card deserves an errata. Or, use your brain.<br />
--The taxi driver who charged us $45 from O&#39;hare to the hotel<br />
--The TSA for holding onto my luggage in LGA and almost not getting it to the tourney.<br />
<br />
As always, it was awesome meeting all the new people (Phil, Adam, etc) and meeting up with all the oldschoolers. Hope to see everyone at Match Play, or next year&#39;s Worlds.<br />
