I took these guys to Origins, promising their moms they would eat right, get enough sleep, and be good (riiighhhhht....).  We had a great time and look forward to more conventions in the future.  After looking at our vacation and their LotR schedule, we decided that this would be our last roadtrip as Team &quot;I Bent My<br />
Wookie.&quot;  (don&#146;t ask...)  Although these guys tweaked their decks, I hadn&#146;t touched mine since Origins even though I had a way-cool insert deck designed.  Maybe some other time.  So we do the usual online chat the week before the tournament, set up our meeting time, and away we go.<br />
<br />
I meet the guys at about 10:15, but Bill forgot something and we had to go to his house to get cards.  Add to that 20 minutes of bumper to bumper traffic on the NJ Turnpike, Bah!   Despite a missed turn we still get there at 12:20 (which even for a 12pm start, this isn&#146;t bad because Tom H-K is ALWAYS late).  Mike Dalton is there, chatting away and I tease him relentlessly, &quot;ooh, SW is sooooo dead... I only <br />
play LotR....&quot;  In the spring he had come to a few tournaments and traded LotR and bad-mouthed SWCCG.  Around Origins, he apparently had a change of heart and he started to play again.  Other than Mike, Tom, Kelly Krieble, and Joe Strecklis, I didn&#146;t recognize any of the other players.  At 12:30 Tom finally pulls his thumb out of his.. and makes the pairings.  We have 11 plus him so away we go!!<br />
<br />
My Decks:<br />
<br />
LS:    Generic Naboo Jedi Lightsaber Combat.  You can pull this deck off of any decent website.<br />
<br />
DS:    SYCFA/Fear Will Keep Them In Line.  I did not use one from the net, but Lingrell made a few recommendations for cards and I picked a few that would be fun too.  Each one helped me win (see Origins report).<br />
<br />
Game 1:   My LS v. James Birmbaum&#146;s Endor Trooper Swarm<br />
<br />
It appeared as though James was a player returning to the game.  His deck had some interesting ideas, but it was clear it hadn&#146;t been modernized.  He had no shield, starting effect, objective, etc..  Our first turn we deployed a few locations and drew a few.  He started <br />
Endor, deployed the platform, and 2nd turn he put down Judicator and 2 Tie LN&#146;s. He then put an ion cannon on the Judicator, which made me hold off on deploying there.  I get Naboo Qui Gon down and we exchange drains at our respective locations for a few turns.  He gets EPP Vader to the landing platform, and I deploy EPP Luke and Naboo Yoda <br />
there.  We battle, he loses Vader because I pull R2 in Red 5 off of Colo Claw Fish to make Vader go away.  He draws a zero, so Vader and 2 force go.  Next turn I realize my error with Yoda and offer to lose him and let him take the 2 force back.  He decided to let me redeploy to an appropriate location (Council Chamber on table) and he still gets his force back.  Vader was still lost because Luke would have toasted him anyway.  I get R2 in Red 5 at the platform, and Uber Falcon out, then Luke takes off to help Han.  He starts a battle next turn.  He blasts the falcon with the ion cannon, but I still draw mad destiny (7 and 6) and finally clear out the system. Next, a whole load of Endor troopers and ATST&#146;s start going to the platform and we have a bunch of little battles there. I get Corran <br />
and Melas there, Luke lands, and Uber Falcon sits helpless (no power, maneuver, or hyperspeed).  After 2 turns he has noone left at the platform, then he deploys a Tie interceptor with a cannon to Endor.  He pops the Falcon (oooo  he had to draw a one..) and I draw my destiny and that pretty much clears out the few force cards he had <br />
left.  A fun game!  FW by 18<br />

<br />
-We had fun.  I had to remind him about drains and stuff, but we had a good time.<br />
<br />
Slops:  <br />
<br />
-Not a &quot;modern&quot; deck.  If he had a trooper assault it wouldn&#146;t have been so close.  <br />
<br />
Mid game, Arvind shows up and Tom has to drop (lucky me!).  I end up writing over half of the tournament game results anyways because he is playing swccg and lotr with some other guys...<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2:  My DS v. Arvind Bhasker&#146;s  LS Combat w/Squass and podrace.<br />
<br />
My first turn, I get Exec DB and can&#146;t find DS War Room.  I deploy Fondor after getting Executor at the beginning of the game, and draw a few cards, finding DS War Room.  He uses Squass for Grand Moff Wedge and his ship, and deploys to Fondor (BASTARD!).  He also gets Goo Nee Tay out early, so my next turn Motti and Piett are very expensive at the DS: Docking Bay.  The Avenger goes down to DS for 5, then I move the gang to Kiffex.  My next turn, Fear Will Keep Them In Line and Adm. Chiraneau and the Devastator goes to Kiffex too.  Now he has Luke Skywalker, JK, and a Baragwin at Naboo and they are draining for 2 then retrieving a device or weapon each turn.  I plop Emperor Palpatine at the DS: DB where he sits the whole game.  He then wins <br />
the race (I did have Sebulba&#146;s racer..  darn!!).  I lose only 3 due to the shield, and I also get Something Special Planned for Them&quot; down.  I try to chase down his ships (now he has Dash out) and he always has enough force to run away and still drain me on Naboo.  He puts QuiGon at DS:DB and moves him to the War ROom.  I decide to take a chance and put out the Combat shield and deploy EPP Vader to the <br />
other Naboo site.  He can&#146;t drain a turn (woohoo!) but he brings Luke over anyways and Combats Vader away.  He never fights me in space and his retrieval engine helps him win by 25.  FL (-25)  <br />

<br />
<br />
Game 3:  My DS vs. Greg Shaw&#146;s WYS.<br />
<br />
Greg and I have never played in regular constructed play.  I hate WYS, but I figure I have a chance with my space fleet.  In my first 2 turns I managed to get out 3 - 2/1 systems and he decides to put random docking bays on Tatooine.  I didn&#146;t have &quot;Fear&quot; early on, but I managed to drain him a few turns with the Avenger and Devastator.  As I crept the Death Star towards the upper-end of the solar system, we kept deploying ships gradually and he had virtual Farmboy on R2 in Red 5 at Tatooine and worked a little Celebration with some lame smugglers on Tatooine.  Thanks to Ozzel, Piett, and Motti, my ISD&#146;s are 4 each, and soon I have Chiraneau and Executor to Fondor and we end up having a 3-way chase with Luke, Old Wedge on RSL, and Mirax <br />
and a Palace Raider on PS.  I didn&#146;t start with &quot;Something Special&quot; and I never got it out, or else I might have slowed things down a great deal for him.  About 2/3&#146;s into the game, however, I hit him with a Limited Resources.  I move to Tatooine and he scurries away.  I deploy EPP Vader and Tarkin to Executor and shuttle them down to start<br />
killing folks on Tatooine.  U-3po also helps slow things down.  We exchange Admiral&#146;s orders a few times.  After Tarkin and Vader finish their &quot;hit and run&quot; on Tatooine, I put EPP Maul in the Cantina to mess with his EPP Han, but didn&#146;t have enough force to start a fight.  He deploys another character and Maul makes mincemeat of them.  While this is happening, he and I keep exchanging Tatooine and Kessel with Luke and Chiraneau.  He figures I&#146;m out of characters, so when I get another EPP Vader on Executor, Luke is Overwhelmed and I rule the skies.  He decides to move his other ships over to Kessel and Tatooine, with the DS at parsec 6 causing all kinds of damage with &quot;Fear.&quot;  He makes a last-ditch fight on the ground when he realizes that I have the game, and I get a full win by 8.<br />

Game 4:  LS v. Bill Kafer&#146;s DS Senate with special surprise<br />
<br />
WHAT?  I have to play my other carpool-mate?  He deploys senate and Naboo system to start with Dark Side Squass.  He deploys virtual Black 2 and pilot to Naboo, then goes to get Scimitar Bomber!!  I can&#146;t get my R2 in Red 5 EVER!! so I can&#146;t count on my combat card destinies!!  I decide to let him have Naboo, but I get out Battle Order Shield to at least slow him down.  I do use a few control/tunnel vision drawn luckily to cancel his drain at Naboo.  He brings<br />
EPP Maul to my Young Obi Jedi Knight and starts a fight.  I use Resilience then next turn he bombs the Palace Generator.  I get Naked 3PO out to the Core, and he deploys Hoth: War ROom and a generic docking bay to Naboo.  I manage to get Boussh to the Senate, but I decide to never ever ever deploy  Jedi Council.  He never gets Responsibility of Command out since I swapped it on his Colo Claw Fish earlier.  He tries to retrieve with Squabbling Delegates, but I Sensed it.  It eventually becomes a drain race on Naboo as he deploys characters and fighters to the DB and moves some down from orbit to cover his butt.  Luke with Saber clears out his lone senator<br />
at the War Room, and Yoda and some random helpers hold the docking bay.  He keeps a ship in orbit and I win the drain race.  FW by 10.<br />

Game 5:   DS v. Ed Hume&#146;s We Have a Plan.<br />
<br />
God draw.  What else can I say?  By turn 3 I have EPP Maul, EPP Vader, and Grand Moff Tarkin in the Throne room and I am unmolested in space while I use Imperial Command to get Admirals and deploy ISD&#146;s each turn, gradually raising my force loss due to &quot;Fear.&quot;  He musters Amidala, Genital Jar Jar, QuiGon with his LS, and random security guards and handmaidens to help.  He brings them in, and I let him initiate the first battle.  I basically make all of his Henchmen go away, at the cost of my Tarkin and Maul, and he<br />
scurries away.  I deploy another Tarkin and EPP Maul, and he deploys Boss Nass and some Gungans and brings them into the hallway.  Although they get into the Throne Room and we have one more go-around, he can&#146;t keep up with me in space.  I drain/&quot;Fear&quot; him to win.  (Note:  My last turn&#146;s drains were 2,2,1,2 thanks to Chiraneau, and the &quot;Fear&quot;<br />
loss was 2,2,2.)  FW by 11<br />

Well, at this point Arvind and Dalton finished their game.  Mike is 5-0 with a timed win and Arvind is 4-1 too with a lot of differential points.  Since my diff was really low, I end up not playing Mike.<br />
<br />
Game 6:  LS v. Ed Hume&#146;s Watto Objective<br />
<br />
I played this matchup at Origins in an Episode I format.  I was curious to see if I could handle this matchup.  This ended up being a knock-down, drag out blood match that I was willing to condede at one point, but let me tell the tale:<br />
<br />
He deploys Watto and Xixor first turn to flip, then makes me lose 2 force to put his card back into his used pile (BASTARD!).  I deploy EPP Qui Gon just in hopes of clearing out Watto or Xixor with his lightsaber.  I manage to get Watto, but Xixor stays and I go since I don&#146;t get destiny at the junkyard.  He deploys Arica and Darth Maul and DM&#146;s BD LS to the core, ready to drain me for 3 or maybe 5.  The first time I manage to control it, though. I ate a drain of 3, then I wandered over with another Qui Gon with some <br />
decent combat cards.  Our first bout is my 11 to his 7.  He loses 4 but Maul stayed.  Next time through, I had 13 on there and he ended up losing Maul.  He gets out some random bad guys, including Gamall something or another, and Qui Gon gets sacked.  I plop Boussh down there to stop the drain, but I need to clear that mess out.  I put YoMaFo (Naboo Yoda) down and stack 2-7&#146;s under him, basically doing<br />
a crouching-Yoda, hidden Jedi routine on EPP Maul.  About halfway through the game, he decides to start his podrace and after 5 turns he wins.  I thought I had my 7&#146;s tracked better, but I only lose 4 due to the shield.  He retrieves 6.  He then deploys Salacious Crumb to Naboo with some backup for Arica.  I get Naboo Obi there.  Obi swings at Gamall, making him go to the used pile.  I draw a 7 for <br />
destiny and it is lost (BASTARD!) due to Salacious.  He decides he&#146;s had enough of the Jedi and sacks everything.  I get Qui Gon on Tatooine to try to deal with another Watto and EPP Vader, But we end up battling away leaving him with a drain of 1 and me with a drain of 2 and 3.  Thanks to Battle Plan, we have to pay for our drains, which ends up costing him the game.  He went from a 19 to 8 advantage in force and I end up draining him for 3, leaving him with<br />
2 so he can&#146;t pay to drain.  With my last 3 cards, I drain him for 2 at the Palace Generator, and I win by 3.  <br />

-Me forgetting again that Vader can&#146;t drain on the 0 side  of my objective... this happened at Origins and it could   have cost me today.<br />
-Him forgetting to take advantage of his objective&#146;s text.<br />
He could have made me lose force mid-game.  <br />

Final Standings (Top 5)<br />

1.   Dalton    6-0 with a timed win<br />
2.   Me        5-1<br />
3.   Bill K    4-2<br />
4.   Arvind    4-2<br />
5.   Kelly K   4-2 with a timed win<br />
 <br />
Wrapping it up:  This was a great day!  I came in 2nd place, and even Nathan Brown stopped by to see how we were all doing.  Although he&#146;s retired, it is good to see him and we are hoping to make plans to hang out before I move to Ohio next month.  After stopping at Wendy&#146;s on the way home (our post-tournament tradition), the guys gave me <br />
thank you/going away presents and I was pleasantly surprised.  Greg and Bill gave me a collector&#146;s tin with Austin Powers Playing Cards and a new Hacky Sack (we killed mine at Origins).  Jon gave me 3 packs of R3 and 3 Coruscant.  I gave Greg all my extra JK cards, as he and<br />
Bill are planning something special at DCon.  <br />
<br />
After 5 years of playing SWCCG in this area and meeting over 150 players, this was a happy going away event.  Bill and Greg swore they were padding my rating, but they looked awfully irked at times.  They must be good actors too.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good times!<br />
