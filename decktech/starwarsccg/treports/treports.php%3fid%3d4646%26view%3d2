That I sucked for a while after Tatooine, I attribute to all the horrible things everywhere in life and not at all to my play. No, never. That I&#39;ve still failed to return to the top tier of Minnesota play I attribute to Garrett Larson. He just isn&#39;t helping me tech out enough. Garrett, I know you&#39;re reading this, and, really, man, you owe me. Start sharing the tech, eh?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I suspect all the long-time Minnesotan SW:CCGers suspected that when Virtual Set 4 (or 3, whichever) came out with the new Yoda (v) that, sooner or later, I would build a MWYHL deck. They were right. But, the thing was that MWYHL still sucked as an objective, or maybe it didn&#39;t fully &quot;suck&quot; in the way that, oh, DBO sucks or the much-abused RalOps now sucks, but it certainly is no longer good or even a valid option for people hoping to win tournaments. Hence, I didn&#39;t play it for months (and not just because I spent some months without attending tournaments), but once I realized that I was going to need some collaboration of miracles to win tournaments, I figured I ought to save my miracles for things that really matter (like getting my novel finished on schedule) and could squander my tournaments (if having fun is &quot;squandering&quot;) by playing MWYHL and the IG-88 (v) CCT deck I built a while ago. (It&#39;s a fun deck, too, but an auto-loss to Throne Room, anything that doesn&#39;t have rebels, and anything played by really good players that aren&#39;t playing decks even goofier than CCT with IG-88. As a footnote, sort of, it was inspired by a similar deck Peter Jacobson played in a tournament. Except his was Scummy and performed accordingly. It was a cool idea, though, and I decided to play it with dark twixxes and Dark Jedi. I named it &quot;My rip-off of Peter Jacobson&#39;s CCT deck, except better.&quot;)<br />
<br />
So, my attempt at the World Record for most parentheticals now concluded, on with the TR:<br />
<br />
17 players show up at Twin City Comics for one of Nick Kolnik&#39;s local Minneapolis tournaments (though the place is actually in Columbia Heights)(hey! I guess I&#39;m not done with my parentheticals). I pray that I didn&#39;t just drive 1.5 hours to get the bye and waste a small miracle with a first round pairing against a total noob.<br />
<br />
Well, not a total newbie. He&#39;s played in one previous tournament, stands about 5 foot, 5 inches, maybe. Looks like he&#39;s either just starting high school or still in junior high and starts pulling his deck out of the Death Star constructed deck box. &quot;Go easy on me,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not playing the constructed deck?&quot; I say, hoping (please! please!) that he&#39;s not. Among other things, I actually *like* my Dark Side silliness and want to play it against something into which someone&#39;s put effort. Fortunately, he&#39;s made a deck, but it might as well have been a constructed deck.<br />
<br />
Game 1: Iggy vs (sorry, I forgot his name. Such poor taste on my part) Random space with matching ships and pilots<br />
<br />
He starts Rendez-vous Point and some effects. Pretty much the only one that matters is Squassin. The rest he doesn&#39;t use. I take his Squid-head captive (not Ackbar or the other decent one) and start abusing IG-88, pulling sites and then, once my generation is solid, pulling stuff to beat him down when he tries to come to the ground. He finally comes to me with Luke and Chewie, but I Barrier Luke since I like battling on my terms. (I used Iggy to pull the Barrier earlier, of course.) Nick comes over to our table to watch the game for a while since he likes my deck&#39;s premise, having seen its results in its previous tournament. I pull a character with Iggy on my opponent&#39;s turn and then another on my turn and suddenly Iggy, who was very much alone, is joined by Maul w/Double Stick, Dr. E/Ponda combo, and 4-Lom. I use 4-Lom against Luke, play I Have You Now, target Luke, miss, try again, assassinate him, and with 40 power (or such) to Chewie, I force his Houjix. My deck&#39;s primary weakness is then exposed as I can&#39;t do much damage to my opponent as he starts building in space. He deploys a single A-Wing to R.V. Point and then, on another turn, deploys Hobbie in his ship to Endor but forgets to move his A-Wing to join Hobbie. I pull the Executor and Thrawn on successive turns with Iggy and launch them against Hobbie. He goes down along with a lot of force. Unfortunately, I&#39;m only able to drain for a couple each turn, and he sets up a small fleet at R.V. Point. I continue to set up on the ground so that I can get Search and Destroy into effect and force him to move to Endor where, once he takes the bait, I hit him with the Executor, Thrawn, Guri, Zuckuss in MH, Bossk in Bus, and Sick Fett. We finish shortly.<br />
FW by 34. 2(+34)<br />
<br />
Good: I win by 34, exactly the number Nick told the kid I wouldn&#39;t win by since I had drawn too many cards into my hand.<br />
Bad: I had to play some new kid with his random deck. Unlike Michael Raveling I would rather not have to play new kids and &quot;put them in their places.&quot;<br />
<br />
Game 2: My MWYHL vs. Raveling&#39;s Walkers<br />
(Whoopee.)<br />
<br />
Originally, I thought this might be a good match-up, especially when Mike didn&#39;t start No Escape (so that I could pull Honor and actually use it to good effect). We proceed as you would expect: He sets up to blow the Generators while I work on my tests, moving pretty quickly through them despite drawing both Yoda and Daughter into my opening hand. After a couple turns, I get Luke (v) and Moff Wedge into matching ships at Hoth, and Mike teaches me something I didn&#39;t know about the Walker objective: He gets to add to his total battle destiny for each Imperial in battle at the Hoth system. I lose Wedge and then, on the next turn, Luke (with a Houjix), and the bulk of my space fleet. Had I known, I might have deployed them to my Kiffex where they would have probably held their own. Anyway, I then learn something else about the Walker objective I hadn&#39;t paid much attention to earlier when I was playing Profit and such: I can&#39;t cancel his force drain bonuses unless I control a Hoth location. So, my deck is pretty much hosed, and Graham Neal, at the adjacent game, makes a comment when I express my ignorance, &quot;Now Grace will probably whine about the virtual cards.&quot; Ah, it was an astute observation as I might have been so inclined, but with Graham&#39;s sagacious remark in the open air, there&#39;s little cause for me to complain about what&#39;s already obvious, and I decide that I&#39;ll just have fun losing to someone who should probably beat me anyway. When I draw into Corran Horn, I go after a Hoth location, but though I&#39;m able to take out some walkers, I can&#39;t hold onto it forever. I lose force little by little until I can&#39;t maintain presence on Hoth and Mike uses his second Garrison to drain me for a nice clump of 6 (since my Honor still reduced his drains at the non-battleground locations). Meanwhile, Leia gets through Test 5, and I get Test 6 on the table but no longer have enough force to try to get her to Hoth to duel Vader, so I lose but mark my loss as an acceptable defeat since it&#39;s only by 14 and to the best player in Minnesota. FL by 14. 2(+20)<br />
<br />
Good: Losing by only 14 with MWYHL.<br />
Bad: Graham, can I please complain about how overpowered the virtual cards are? Please? There&#39;s a difference between making new cards playable and making them the only viable option until all LS decks are meta-ed against them and, thus, allowing other DS decks to become viable again.<br />
<br />
I think I got food here or something.<br />
<br />
Game 3: My MWYHL vs. Herb Macy&#39;s Hunt Down.<br />
<br />
Herb used to be the bane of my SW tournament experiences. He used to be the worst possible opponent, but he&#39;s mellowed considerably and is now actually fun to play most of the time. This game proved to be a little disappointing, but it was still in good spirits. Herb had a nice opening hand getting Lord Vader down to the Endor DB with his saber. I ditched my Insight to pull Honor, lost one to Visage, and on my turn played Daughter with the objective and Honor and the Battle Plan shield. On his turn, he chose not to drain so that he could get out Tarkin and the Drop effect (or whichever works like the new Traffic Control), and he started telling me that the game was over since he couldn&#39;t do Visage damage. Well, it was probably true, but it was a bit disappointing to hear. Two turns later I cancelled his drain bonuses and retrieved most of my lost pile with Yoda. He had deployed the Emperor and a couple of docking bays so that he was activating a lot, but I still wasn&#39;t making him lose force. That changed, though, when I deployed Qui-Gon with his Stick to my Naboo: Generator site (whichever is the 2/2 site), flipping him so that he was losing to Visage while I wasn&#39;t, and I was able to drain him. Herb played a spaceport docking bay, though, to Naboo and marched over, hoping to battle. I had, in my hand, both the Sorry About the Mess combo and an OOC/TT combo, so I let him move Vader to Qui-Gon&#39;s site, along with a few other heavy-hitters, tried to kill Vader, but missed. So Qui-Gon ran away whereas, otherwise, I might have had him take on Herb&#39;s 3 remaining characters. We played duck-and-chase for a couple turns; he actually killed Qui-Gon once with Blizzard 4 and Mara, but the jedi master proved Resilient whereas Herb&#39;s forces were decimated. I still didn&#39;t have much of a lost pile by the time Daughter began Test 5, and Herb drew up to keep my differential down. It made sense, but it was such a strangely subdued and defeatist move that I didn&#39;t know what to make of it. FW by 24. 4(+44)<br />
<br />
Good: Herb&#39;s become a fun opponent.<br />
Bad: The game&#39;s conclusion was foregone as Herb&#39;s deck lacked any tricky surprises to catch me ninja-style for the death touch.<br />
<br />
So, we finish with a bunch of time left and Garrett&#39;s done with his game and this tournament&#39;s full of people timing out, left and right, so we start a fun game, playing his goofy-arse Hyperdrive Generator deck against my CCT deck (which is crippled without a rebel), and shortly before pairings are called I gain a definitive edge.<br />
<br />
Then Nick pairs me against Garrett, and we shuffle our decks, leaving out our starting stuff, and try again.<br />
<br />
Game 4: Iggy Superstar vs. Garrett&#39;s Mistake<br />
<br />
Well, you have to give Garrett credit for trying. A-plus for effort, my man. But the deck&#39;s a C at best. This time, when we start, I&#39;m smart and decide to verify that he doesn&#39;t have a rebel, meaning I count how many jedi he has, and they aren&#39;t many (think: 3). Mostly, he battles with Senators and the Senator destiny adder, so I grab it this game, and, well, the rest is a matter of time. Unfortunately, without Iggy, I don&#39;t grab all my twixxes (and, in fact, draw one for battle destiny against an otherwise-toasted Qui-Gon), so I suffer a bit of a force choke. Eventually, though, Dark Jedi vs. Senators means Dark Side win. This one by 24. I&#39;d give more details, but I guess between the two games, things blurred together. I supposed the only thing that was really interesting to me was that, with my objective flipped, I was retrieving a force each control phase, allowing me to use Force Lightning with the Emperor during Garrett&#39;s end of turn phase and retrieve it on my turn, wash, rinse, repeat. Finally, he grabbed it, but I think that between my two Force Lightnings I played them five or six times. Lots of Senators died to Pasty that way. Much fun. As previously stated, FW by 24. 6(+68)<br />
<br />
Good: I owed Garrett one for MN States when he drew the Emperor early with his Black Sun vs. my Profit and proceeded to obliterate me despite the fact I played 6 Lukes and had beaten him three times in playtesting, all in lopsided games. Grr.<br />
Bad: Hyperdrive Generator? C&#39;mon, Garrett, there&#39;s a line between good fun and too many mind-influencing drugs. Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Raveling went undefeated to win, and my differential was apparently good enough to earn me 2nd. I really have no idea about the rest of the places as Garrett and I were playing my CCT vs. his Spombat (light side LS Combat) while Nick handed out prizes. I don&#39;t own the Dark Side anti-Combat shield, so I suffered a bit, there, but my 3rd turn beat down against his Qui-Gon forced him to take 16 overflow (Vader, Fett and Dr. E/Ponda with Sidious alone at the Carbon Chamber). That was just enough of an early edge for me to hold out for the win. Barely.<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
Nick for running these things.<br />
Garrett for three fun games.<br />
Mike Raveling and Herb Macy for a couple good games.<br />
Whichever pack yielded unto me the Japanese Foil Wedge, my one decent pull of the day.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
The rest of my prize-support packs. I am cursed.<br />
Walkers. Well, not the walkers so much as the million things the objective does.<br />
Me for forgetting my first opponent&#39;s name. Sorry, dude.<br />
