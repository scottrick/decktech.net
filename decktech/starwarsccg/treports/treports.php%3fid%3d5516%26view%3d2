Here is my TR from the Tennessee DPC held on June 10th. Sorry for the delay in posting this, I started working on it weeks ago, but never got around to posting it. I hope it lets you in on how the event took place, and what I had to do to earn my bye. <br />
<br />
First off, I want to say that this event was MUCH harder than some of you might think. Even thought there was only 7 players who showed up. All but 1 of them have played in 2 or more Day 2 of Worlds over the past 10 years. Not only that, but we had 1 former World Champion (Jonathan Chu, 2003) and a second place Worlds Finisher (Steven Lewis, 1999). Rippetoe has qualified for Day 3 two or three times. Micah and Danny have both qualified the past two years. So even though the numbers were low, the quality of player was at an all time high. If I was going to qualify, I would have to win at least 3 games. <br />
<br />
Now, what to play?? That is always the question. The weeks leading up to the event, I had planned to play Speeders for LS and RalOps for DS. I thought Speeders would be a pure surprise and take players off guard. While the RalOps was something I was used to from the past months of playing. As time went by, I decided that a bigger surprise would be to play an Undercover deck for LS. The current Meta does NOT have enough Undercover protection, so a deck could be built that could totally cancel all ground drains by just playing with more Spies than the DS had ways to get around. The majority of cards used by DS are Interrupts, so I built this deck that played 5 grabbers under my Starting Effect. With 2x I Dont Need Their Scum, Either (v) in the deck to pull them, no DS deck would be able to get around all the Spies. Basically the deck worked like this. I started Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber with Rycar (v), Strike Planning, and Dismantle on Sight (v). The deck was designed to be a lock down direct damage deck with a late game beatdown potential with Mace, Scout Luke, Courage of a Skywalker, and Jedi Presence. This worked very well because there isn&#39;t a DS player out there that wouldn&#39;t forget about guys at sites blocked by an Undercover spy for 10 turns. The deck would set back and just cause damage, then when the time was right, it could end the game right there. To cause damage I played 3x Anger, Fear, and Aggression, Uncontrollable Fury, Padme (v), Leebo (v), and a drain at the Theed Palace: Core. The Dismantle on Sight (v) allowed me to slow down the opponent by not letting search for anything outside of their Deploy phase. Also allowed me to play Dont Do That Again whenever I played against a Bespin CR (v) deck to stop the Mob Points Combo. The main reason for playing with it though was to keep the DS from doing random searches to reset where the AFA was in their deck. So often in the past, players would search for / at any time possible just to put the AFA back at the bottom of their deck. Dismantle (v) provided that extra pain that allowed more AFAs to pop. <br />
<br />
After creating my new LS deck, I decided to go ahead and build a new DS as well. I first started out with an ISB I saw at the Y4 Regional, but after some playtesting, I couldn&#39;t make it work. Then I moved on to a Tuskan Tat CR (v) start with fast early drain, but I decided against playing it because I had no way to get around Entrenchemnt (v) in WYS (v). The DS deck I ended up playing was a Bespin CR (v) start with the Tower to pull Lando (v). The deck was a basic space beatdown with Star Destroyers, much like a SYCFA, only all the Fear and ground stuff was replaced with different space toys. This was mainly because I wanted a space based deck that could handle WYS (v). DS is not powerful enough on the ground, so I knew I would have a better chance of winning if I played in space. The deck would set up Free Executor with Lando (v) and Admiral Chiraneau then add a Tractor Beam and Def Shield (v) to capture ships and be safe from Power Pivot and Dash. The main reason I wanted to play this deck was because of Theyve Shut Down the Main Reactor. This card is WAY under used. I have no idea why so many dont choose to abuse this card. For those that dont know, TSDTMR says if I have a capital ship armed with a weapon or tractor beam, target a starship present. Target may NOT move or use ability toward drawing destiny. So, with this one USED interrupt, I can not only trap Home One, but I take their destiny away. If you combine that with a Lateral Damage, GG!! <br />
<br />
So, I had my two decks. Going into the tournament, I thought were going to have a HUGE turn out. The tournament was posted months in advance, AND we had two byes to Worlds. One would think we would get a few players from other States to show up. NOPE!!! Only one player not from TN made the trip, Chu. And he went to college in Nashville for 4 years, so he doesnt really count either. WHERE WERE ALL THE PLAYERS!!! No one from KY, AL, GA, FL, NC, SC, and on and on came to this tournament. Just doesnt make any since. Anyway, time for the games. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Game 1 My LS vs Chus Tuskan Timer Mines  This game was weird because when he dropped his starting, it was the same DS deck that I was going to play before I decided that Entrenchment (v) would be too much to handle in WYS (v). Of course had I known about the Timer Mine tech with Inconsequential Losses (v) then I would have reconsidered. Well, what can I say, this game went very fast because I had no way of stopping the Timer Mines, plus I ran out of ways to get around all the Sandwhirls. To start the game, Chu just activated and drew up. Had I had my Grimtaash in my hand, Chu told me later that his entire hand was doubles, and he had no choice but to draw up first turn to get all he needed. That was my only opportunity for victory in this game. Since both of us were playing the Refections III Starting Effects there was unlimited searches. My first turn, I pulled Mercenary Armor (v) with Rycar (v). Then pulled Mothma (v) with Strike Planning deploy her to the Jedi Council with the Armor, used the Armor to pull Undercover (v) and deployed it on her, then used Undercover (v) to pull Sabotage (v). Finally, I used her text to pull the Naboo: Core and said go. His turn he set up URORRURUR (v) with matching Bantha and UrUR (v) from Special Edition. They all sat in front of the Sandwhirl. My turn, I controlled the Sandwhirl, which he grabbed and thinking he didnt already have another Sandwhirl I deployed Corran Horn with another Undercover (v) pulled by the Armor. I did have another Control when he tried to deploy another Sandwhirl, but he deployed Maul in Ship to Tatooine and Sensed it. Corran went missing. From there it was all down hill. He did the stupid Relocate with UrUR (v) and drained for like 12. I had no way of getting around the Sandwhirl, so I began to set up drains. I got Mace (v) with Lightsaber Proficiency to the Core, and continued to insert Anger, Fear, and Aggression for him to lose 4 force from not battling. I got 2 off in this game. Mace did nothing because the very next turn he dropped the Mining Droid and a Timer Mine in front of Mace. He got one drain off, then on his turn he drew well anything he wanted and Mace just died. How could a retarded card like this ever get made?? It even happens at the very beginning of the turn, so there is NOTHING you can do about it. I had lost the Sabotage to drain when I didnt know the Mines were in the deck. A few more drains, and I was finished. <br />

Highs  Nothing. This was a total NPE!!! <br />
Lows  The whole game. why did this errata take place the very Monday after I had to play against this crap? Props to Chu for playing it while he could.  <br />

<br />
Game 2 My DS vs Tommys CP (v) Credits  Truthfully I was ready to play this game because Tommy has been playing this deck for over a year now. I have probably played against it over 10 times so I knew what to expect. First turn I pulled Executor and Lando but didnt have the Free Executor Effect yet, so I deployed some systems, drew some, and said go. His turn, he activated all he could, played Escape Pod (v) to find Savrip, then just drew up all that was there, so his hand had like 21 cards. At this time I did have my Monnok, so to begin my turn, I played it lost to put all but 8 in Used pile. I played WMAOPs to pull the free Effect. Deployed Executor, Lando, Admiral Chiraneau, played Levitation Attack (v) to put Def Shield (v) and a Tractor Beam on Executor. Then I moved it to Sullest, drew some and said go. His turn, he dropped Mace (v), stick, and Mediation NON V. My turn, I deployed some more Systems, played another WMAOPs to get a Lat Damage, drew some more. He drained for 2 and got 1 card stacked, then deployed Bright Hope (v) and Spiral to Bespin. Surprise he did this since he saw that I had the Lat Dam in my hand. My turn, I drained, put U3P0 in front of Mace, played another WMAOPs to find Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (v), then deploy Stalker (v), Tyrant, and Thunderflare in front of the two ships. Put Lat on Spiral and battled. He lost both ships and 12 cards in overflow. After the battle, I moved the remaining ships to different planets. He had no drain, and deploy some more guys to the Outskirts. I put out Drop non V and began to track a 1, he got a drain of 2 off and said go. I drained some more and tracked the 1 and played Overload with Lando (v) to make Mace Lost. Since he drain was blocked and I had a steady drain of 9 in space. Game was shortly finished <br />

Game 3  My DS vs Micahs Endor Mains  My hand was alright, but nothing special. I did get all 3 WMAOPs that were in my deck in my opening hand. Both decks played Ref III starting effects, so another game of unlimited searches. My first turn, I used WMAOPs to find the Free Executor Effect, Found Executor with Mob Points Combo, then sacked Mob Points to get Endor Shield (v), used it to find Admiral Chiraneau and Thrawn, pulled Lando also, deployed Executor with Lando and Chiraneau to Bespin. Pulled Sullest also, and moved them over. His turn, he pulled all his stuff with Rycar, Strike Planning, Pulled Back Door, Endor Effects, Free Scout Luke, his stick, and moved General Solo (v) and Mothma (v) to the Back Door. I drained and deployed another system, and played Lev Attack (v) to put the Tractor Beam and Def Shield (v). I played another WMAOPs to get the Lat Dam, also put U3P0 at the Back Door. His turn, he dropped Chewie, Protector, and then he surprised me by deploying Tantive IV (v) and Bright Hope (v) to Bespin. I think he thought he would be safe with his once per game Thats One (v) to cancel the battle. My turn I deployed Tyrant and Thrawn, then played another Lev Attack (v) to put another Tractor Beam on Tryant, then I put Lat Dam targeting Tantive, then played Theyve Shut Down the Main Reactor on Tantive so not only could he not move away but he no longer had destiny. I battle, and he canceled. Since he couldnt move, I moved my loaded Executor to Bespin and drew some. So he had one turn to put as much on the two ships as he could to absorb the battle damage coming on my next turn. He did activate a lot, but he decided to look for his Mediation (v) so he could play his Houjix from under his Starting Effect, but it wasnt in his force pile when he played Control/Tunnel Vision. So rather than try and deploy more characters to prevent a super beatdown, he just drew some cards. My turn, I dropped two more Star Destroyers and killed both ships dead with 24 in overflow. One turn of train later, and game was over.<br />

Game 4  My LS vs Dannys Senate  Well, going into this game I was very very worried because Danny was the only person that had seen the deck I was playing before the tournament, so there was absolutely no surprise factor. The good thing was that because I started Dismantle on Sight (v), he didnt even get all 4 Political Effects out the whole game. We both set up, him with Lott Dod and me with Mon Mothma (v) and Undercover stuff. I got an Anger, Fear in his deck early, and kept them coming all game. Since he knew what I was playing, he started Naboo, and immediately put guys out to drain. Like a champ, my first card lost from the game off the top blind was Tydrium (v), so I had to use my Strikeforce (v) to hope to retrieve it. Then he put out the Coward shield, so I couldnt even do that until I could put my Home One in space. Then the second card from the top blind was Home One, so for me to win this game I would be able to deploy to space. So, I deployed Mace (v), Scout Luke (v), Padme (v), and Leebo (v) to the Naboo: Core. They never got a drain of until the very end of the game thanks to the PE, but I was causing 1 damage a turn from Leebo as well as 1 from Padme. Each turn, all he could do was drain in space and recycle his Senators. Knowing I played with Jedi Presence and Courage of a Skywalker to make Luke power 24, he never came down to battle. Once Boushh hit the table, he was losing 2 for Padme, plus Leebo. Normally, I would have just killed myself with Leebo, but because I had nothing else to do, I did a fair job of tracking the two Flash of Insights with Threepio, so I was able to play it a good 7 times this game. I began just using Leebo to keep the def low, but it turned out to be what won me the game. I was able to get all three Sqaubling Dels from Leebo, so he never retrieved with it. Plus I got off at least 4 Anger Fears. The game was tight, but I came out with the win by simply not deploying as much as he did. In the end, I was on the ground and he was in space. Since I had more direct damage over drains, I could still hurt him while he could no longer pay to drain. <br />

Highs  Getting the 4th Anger Fear late game to cause the last 4 cards in damage I needed to win, also him not playing with Resistance.<br />
Lows  Getting both of my ships lost to random blind crap. The odds of that happening so early are like 10,000 to 1. <br />

Game 5  My DS vs THE BYE!!  Well since no one can have the Bye twice in a tournament, each of use took a turn at having the bye. Since this was my 5th game, it gave me the last win points I needed to qualify for Worlds. Since both Lewis and Chu had already qualified, there was no way I would not get the 2nd Bye. I spent the time watching the games, and helping Jim Colson bring the prize support in. I made a great trade with him as well. The day turned out to be pretty good even if no one showed up. <br />

Game 6  My LS vs Rips Bespin Downtown Plaza  Since both of us had already earned the byes, the stress of playing was gone. Dismantle (v) allowed me to pull the Dont Do that Again shield, which kept him from finding the Executor. It didnt even hit the table until like turn 4.  Did the same Mothma (v) at the Council and pulled the Core. He put out EPP Vader at the Plaza and drew some more. My turn, I used a Rycar (v) search to pull Uncontrollable Fury, and also put Anger Fear in his deck. I also dropped TK-422 in front Vader. The AFA popped the very next turn, and he lost 6 cards, while still not causing me any damage. I got to put out almost every grabber in  this game. The problem was that I got too goldenrody and grabbed the wrong Interrupts. For the next turns, I got off more Fury damage and a few more AFAs. I was way ahead in the lost pile race. He finally set up Executor with a Tractor Beam and Def Shield (v). I played Sabotage (v) to kill the Beam. He added Blizzard 2 (v) to Vaders site. Then he played Walker Barrage (pulled by B2(v)) and killed TK-422. I grabbed it, as well as Sense Combo, Lev Attack (v), and Lando System (v). The next turn, I got out another Undercover spy to Vaders site, and he pulled a Trample and killed him. The same turn before he got the Trample, I lost my last grabber to the drain of 1 at Bespin. This would prove to be the game for me because for the rest of the game, he played Trample to kill every Undercover spy that came calling. The same Trample in his deck killed off 3 different spies. He also played Blizzard 4, and put Vader on board, then refused to pay maintenance cost, and Vader died, losing the Fury. So now, I was no longer causing damage, and he had a strong drain of 3. I decided to try and cause some damage, so I deployed Mace (v), stick, and Proficiency to the Core. The vary next turn, Rip put out Luke, Luke (v) on Maul with Stick to stop Maces drain. I was stuck again. My next turn, I got out Tydrium (v), Wedge, RL and Corran Horn to fight Executor. I thought I would be able to hold there a few turns since the Beam was gone. But, next turn he throws down Broken Fett, and I had to lose Corran Horn. I moved the ship into the Clouds. I should have just deployed the whole ship there and drained for 2 all game, but I decided I would go after Maul to free up Maces drain. So I deployed Scout Luke (v), Padme, and Landed the Tydrium. His turn he battled, played Hidden Weapons after deploying another Broken Fett. He got a 4, but made it a 3 with Lando (v). Luke was taken, so all that was left was just the forfeit on the ship and my destiny. I lost like everything and 20 cards. So that was game. Dont remember the final card count, think it might have been in the teens. <br />
<br />
FL 8(+20s)   <br />
<br />
Highs  Getting going fast, and taking him off guard<br />
Lows  Grabbing the wrong card, and losing when I had the win<br />

So there you have it, all in all it was a fun tournament. I do wish more players had come out to play. I guess it was the entry fee that scared some players off. Could not be helped since the prize support was $175, with only 7 players, we just made even with the $25 fee. Well, because both Lewis and Chu have already qualified, the byes pasted to Rip and Myself. Rip and Chu decided to work out Chu getting Rips Uncut sheet for the title and the V card design. So no final was needed. Here are the results. <br />
<br />
Brian Rippetoe  1st<br />
Jonathan Chu  2nd<br />
Steven Lewis  3rd<br />
Brandon Ruck  4th <br />
Tommy Kimsey 5th<br />
Micah Wooten  6th<br />
Danny Pack  7th    <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, thats it. I am not going to post my decks from this tournament because I really like both of them. Just know that the LS was mainly for surprise and not meant for all major tournaments. Maybe in time, I will decide to post the LS, but the DS is going to stay mine until after Worlds. <br />
<br />
Thanks guys,<br />
