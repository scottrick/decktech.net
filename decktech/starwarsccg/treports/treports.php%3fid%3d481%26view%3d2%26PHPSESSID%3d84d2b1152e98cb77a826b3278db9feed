until I called Woj at like 1:30 am asking about him having a ruling that<br />
was made and if he could print it out and bring it...he does and will!<br />
Sweet!  I now have some sick LS tech.  I wake up 4 hours later and get<br />
showered and suck then leave at 7am for Woj to pick him up.  I get there,<br />
he gives me the printouts and we leave for Time Warp around 8:20.<br />
<br />
We show up, the place is empty except for a few of the NJ locals...I go on<br />
and fill out my decklists and place the respective names, 'Anktopot' and<br />
'Juz's Revenge' the go about plugging RCon with my new Handouts from<br />
Kinkos.  Even though they screwed the printing up, they came out sweet.<br />
After Ghetto Squad comes with Dan Bordier Burger King hats and Dalton and<br />
company show up we get started to play.  Someone left their wallet at BK<br />
so we wait a few minutes for him then start up.  We only have 19 people<br />
but some very good players.  Heck even Andrew Parks showed up.  So for the<br />
last few weeks everyone has been expecting me to play Y4 mains because I<br />
have been testing like mad with it, but I didn't like it. Plus Charlie<br />
Herren and I were throwing around a Suicide Hunt Down deck with<br />
Screws,Odds, and lots of direct damage but that sucked so I went with my<br />
two decks, with a little extra tech in them ;).<br />
<br />
Game One  My DS Vs Thomas Hermley-Keen's RTP (1658)<br />
Thomas is an up and coming player here in Coruscant and he even took it<br />
too me last week in Clarks Summit and beat me so I needed to have some<br />
revenge here. My opening draw I get Darth Vader so I drop him, pull Leia<br />
into my hand and move to the D* DB and also pulled out the Exec:DB and<br />
Coruscant so I was generating a good amount of force.  I eventually get<br />
out Tempest 1 and ECC IG-88 with Darth at the D*DB when he drops<br />
Orimaarko, EPP Han, and a 2/2 scrub, I think.  He played Captive Pursuit<br />
to target Leia so if he won the battle he would she would be released.<br />
Before he battles I play Put All Sections On Alert to cancel Orimaarko's<br />
Text and ability to draw destiny.  He shoots at IG and Misses, I capture<br />
the 2/2 scrub so now he doesn't get destiny.  I play I Have You Now and end<br />
up losing no one and he loses everything plus some more.  Everything went<br />
right for me for this game.<br />
<br />
FW +40<br />
2 (+40)<br />
<br />
Highlights- Getting Vader and taking Leia early on to stop flipping.<br />
Lowlights- None, Everything was great<br />
<br />
So I know that Lolli, Dalton, and Woj won so I am curious who I play. I<br />
end up playing Pat Brennen but he is using the name (Dark Jedi) and<br />
actually has a rating so this should be interesting.<br />
<br />
Game 2 My LS Vs Dark Jedi's Jabba's Palace deck. (1547)<br />
<br />
So I start my Y4 stuff and he starts JP and Careful Plans for Lars<br />
Moisture Farm so I am thinking of a type of Holman/Brentson Scum Deck.  He<br />
has always been a good player so I needed to make sure I played this well.<br />
This game was pretty uneventful with me beating the crap out of all the<br />
aliens with my EPP/Tawss Hit Squads and having him losing 18 to Odds.  I<br />
even had Tibrin going and retrieving Mains at will to battle some more.<br />
Very Ugly game, especially because he didn't play Odd's protection.  He was<br />
able to play Vaders at will but tracking destinies I was able to draw 5's<br />
left and right.  He never played Scum so I had no idea what the idea of<br />
the deck was.<br />
<br />
FW +30<br />
4 (+70)<br />
<br />
Highlights- Once again my LS deck worked perfectly<br />
Lowlights- Odds only popped twice<br />
<br />
So now my diff is higher by far than anyone else's.  I know Dalton, Woj won<br />
but Lolli lost to Brian Kim and his profit because of Fallen Portal.  I<br />
have to play Woj.<br />
<br />
Game 3 My LS Vs Wojciech Jankowski's Ray Bordier Occu@#$% deck (2005)<br />
<br />
I do not think I have ever beaten Woj in my life so but I knew that I<br />
could so I wondered how things could go.  I start my Y4 start he plays<br />
Yavin IV and Jungle with the SI that lets him play Secret Plans,<br />
Resistance and There Is Not Try.  I get a nudj, draw some.  He<br />
plays the swamp and converts.  Pulls bubo, moves to the nudj and eats.<br />
This game went very slow in the beginning with my mains beating on his<br />
characters but then he spreads out and drops the Big E with Occupation.  I<br />
took out the Endor Celebration which ended up killing me here but there<br />
was some fun moments during this game.  One point he had Vader Tarkin and<br />
Arden at the Forest, I drop EPP Leia and Luke battle, retrieve with DTF he<br />
loses one.  I swing at Tarkin draw a 2, then 5 (he cancels it).  I shoot<br />
at Arden and hit.  I play The Force is Strong with this one and<br />
Skywalkers.  I end up having a power 31 to his 14.  He loses everyone but<br />
not much damage is take from it.  I lose Leia. Another great moment was<br />
when I had 3 cards in hand late game and he took a chance by dropping<br />
Nement to a site by him self hoping I didn't have a character.  My turn I<br />
activate 15 and Tunnel Vision...he craps him self.  I know that Tawss,<br />
Leia and Luke are still in the 30 cards in my piles but when I looked I<br />
had nothing!!!  Crap.  I ended up making it close with a late game insert<br />
and WNMOG on the table but He didn't need to activate and Occupation put<br />
the nail in the coffin....<br />
<br />
FL -7<br />
4(+63)<br />
<br />
Highlights- Beating the piss out of the Three musketeers with Leia and<br />
Luke<br />
Lowlights- deploying EPP Leia to bubo's site without a destiny draw. Duh.<br />
Not beating Woj again...<br />
<br />
So I am in third place now and Dalton too but played the same side as Woj<br />
so I get to play Dalton...another person I haven't beat since 1998 maybe!<br />
<br />
Game 4 My DS Vs Mike Dalton's Y4 mains deck (1958)<br />
This matchup we have done time and time again and I always lose for some<br />
reason...;)  I was going to play this light deck before I decided against<br />
it because I felt more prepared with mine.  He dropped Obi at the D*:DB<br />
pretty early with Boush Undercover to the Holotheatre then also dropped<br />
Tawss to the Holo to cancel Visage.  Plus with Boush Undercover at the<br />
Executor sites, CHYBC would not cancel drains at the sites.  My turn I<br />
drop Vader and beat on Obi, Vader stays because of Put All Sections and I<br />
flip Hunt Down. His turn he tries to drain and I remind him that the<br />
objective is flipped and because of Leia at the same site at Tawss he<br />
cannot initiate drains.  He just moves Tawss to the Med Chamber.  I drop<br />
Mara to the Holotheathe and Deploy Visage again so he loses again.  His<br />
turn he drains for 2 I take it.  He deploys obi again to Vader's site with<br />
Luke.  I put all sections Luke and he battles.  He hits Vader, I hit Obi<br />
and play I Have You Now.  I draw some good destiny so he loses both and a<br />
bunch.  I lose Vader, Evader him to the used pile then play Holonet to<br />
take him back into my hand.  My turn I drop Vader to Tawss site and kill<br />
off that guy while moving back into the D*:DB.  This game went back and<br />
forth for a while until he dropped Obi at the Swamp killed off the nudj<br />
and broke cover with Boush to kill of Mara with a tracked 4.  After to<br />
killed the nudj I reminded him that the nudj had to draw destiny.  He drew<br />
it but didn't have any left to draw in a battle now so It became my turn.<br />
Mara beat on Leia with the aid of Put All Sections and Visage was safe<br />
still. I then pulled of the best part of the game.  I deployed EPP Vader<br />
to the swamp and battles Obi-Wan.  I swung and hit then You Are Beaten Him<br />
to end the battle and kill him before he got destiny.  Nice.  After that he<br />
drew up because he had no characters left.<br />
<br />
FW +12<br />
6 (+75)<br />
<br />
Highlights- The You are beaten on Obi; Finally beating Mike<br />
Lowlights- Dengar going after Tawss early game and not hitting her.<br />
<br />
So now I am back to second place with Woj the only undefeated. I play him<br />
again and Brian Kim plays Dalton.<br />
<br />
Game 5 My DS Vs Woj's Obi's Hut Force Choke. (2005)<br />
<br />
I finally get a chance to revenge.  I wish I could remember any of it<br />
though.  I mostly remember taking over his Tatooine sites with At-At's and<br />
Vader while making him lose to Visage and battles.  I think at this point<br />
I was just getting so damb excited I had a chance to win states.  He got<br />
desperate with playing the Tontine late game but Slave 1 fixed that.  He<br />
also dropped Jeron and cancelled Visage then moved to the revoed Med<br />
Chamber.  My turn, I evadered it then Put Darth down and made him Ghkkk.<br />
The last straw was beating on Obi with Tempest 1 and DLots and drawing a 6<br />
when he drew a 1 for destiny.  I wish I could remember more...my deck was<br />
the antichrist to his though.<br />
<br />
FW +13<br />
8 (+88)<br />
<br />
Highlights- Finally beat Woj!<br />
Lowlights- Drawing 3 destiny in the game and drawing 1,1,and 2.  That<br />
never happens.<br />
<br />
So I am in first place right now but I played Woj twice and Dalton plated<br />
the same side as me.  I end up playing the second highest player for the<br />
DS, Pete Flamini while Woj and Dalton play each other.<br />
<br />
Game 6 My LS Vs Pete Flamini's ROps (1736)<br />
<br />
Before the game we were all joking how Pete was the guys that would be the<br />
Spoiler for someone...here was the chance.<br />
<br />
I start my Y4 stuff and he starts Raltiir and Resistance...gee go figure<br />
;).  Pete knows my deck has odds so of course he starts it...he had to.  We<br />
have never played before so this was sure to be a fun game.   For the<br />
first few turns we just drew and played sites.  On my 4th turn I dropped<br />
Artoo, 8d8, Tibrin, RL in R1 and Red Squad and told him done.  His turn I<br />
asked him how much he was going to activate and he said 8.  After the 7th<br />
card, insert popped and he had to lose 11 cards.  That turn he flipped the<br />
objective and waited.  I dropped BO and WNMOG so I tried kicking on his<br />
planed and deployed Leia, he barriered her and then beat on her with<br />
Tempest 1 and some pilots.  I drew a 5 which helped so she covered it.  I<br />
then started dropping mains and tawss with Mech Failure trying to take him<br />
out.  With his objective flipped I lost my guys but also was able to bring<br />
them back with DTF and Tibrin working for me.  I eventually got him off<br />
his planet and won.<br />
<br />
FW +24<br />
10 (+118)<br />
<br />
<br />
Highlights-  Using Tibrin and DTF to recycle cards that I needed and to<br />
get my cards back.<br />
Lowlights- Never flipping the objective even though he lost everyone.<br />
<br />
So I ended up winning plays 5 different people that know the game very<br />
well and 2 of them I never beat before.  I get the spot to GenCon with<br />
Dalton and get some WB Dagobah to complete my silly quest for playing all<br />
WB cards...<br />
<br />
