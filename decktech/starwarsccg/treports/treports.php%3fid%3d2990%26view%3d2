<br />
PRE-TOURNEY<br />
Yeah there&#146;s a pre-tourney, shut up and take it. It starts at 11:30 am at a Denny&#146;s in Cranberry, PA where I was supposed to meet Drew Ferguson and Jim Li to ride to the tourney. I sat there for a half-hour or so and they didn&#146;t show. So I decided I had two options:<br />
A. Head back home and find something else to do with my Saturday afternoon.<br />
B. Hit the highway and try to find this place on my own.<br />
<br />
I chose B, quite obviously, and about 10 minutes after noon I was on I-79 North headed for Grove City. I&#146;d been past the exit numerous times, knew right where it was; but after the exit, I was clueless as to where the campus was, and where on campus the tourney was held.<br />
<br />
So I&#146;m cruising along in my &#146;76 Fleetwood and coming up on the exit when I go to pass a raggedy old Buick going too slow in the fast lane. I pass it on the right and look over to see none other than Jim Li the Asian Nazi ridin&#146; shotgun! Drew is at the wheel, and there is some as-yet-unnamed gentleman in the back. I&#146;m saved. We get off the exit and I let them in front of me and follow them to the campus.<br />
<br />
We get there shortly before 1 and there&#146;s a nice parking lot where I can park Tha Boat in the shade, and it&#146;s only a short walk to the rec room where the tourney is being held. This place is hooked UP. Two foosball tables, two ping-pong tables, coupla pool tables and a TV. So we had plenty to do between games. I quickly realized how out-of-practice I am at table tennis, and demonstrated my total lack of experience at foosball. But no sweat. We get underway a little bit after 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
TOURNEY BEGINS HERE<br />
in case you skipped the pre-tourney. but you really should go read it.<br />
<br />
My lightside: WYS with the magic formula, FOUR Jedi Lukes and TWO Sabers. also has the tripler card and some stuff for the big beatdown<br />
My darkside: No Money Done RIGHT aka No Tengo Dinero<br />
<br />
Game 1 WYS vs Alex Shulman (1578)&#146;s Court<br />
This is the guy that was in the car with Drew and Jim. He starts Court with PD for No Bargain, Power of the Hutt, and something I forget. I go with my usual Insurrection combo, Battle Plan combo, and SquadAss.<br />
<br />
He uses most of his first turn force for the Sail Barge, pulls the Passenger Deck, and loses to Court.<br />
I pull Home One DBay, lose to Court as well, and do some drawing of my own to get the cards for the beatdown.<br />
<br />
He starts stacking guys in the AChamber. Mighty J gets in there with Chall and Ephant Mon. Ephant is of course the walking Ghhhk so I doubt I&#146;ll be doing beatdown in the Chamber. He&#146;s not draining tho cuz of Battle Plan.<br />
I set up at the system with Dash in the Rider and Mirax in the Skate. Flip with Jedi Luke and his Saber on DBay 94. Battle Plan is fulfilled and I&#146;ve got Melas to stick on the Rider in case he starts pulling ships outta reserve. I&#146;m also assembling the beatdown in hand.<br />
<br />
He drops EPP Fett and Xizor on JK Luke and I Clash Fett before he initiates because I smell Hidden Weapons. He moves Xizor over with some guys on the Barge for safety.<br />
I had the Spaceport Dockbay out between the Pit of Carkoon and the AChamber (had used it to flip, deploying Dash in the Rider for 3 then taking off free) and he had No Escape out, so between Chall in the Chamber and No Escape he was deploying guys for minus-38475 to the &lt;&gt; DBay. But he wasn&#146;t draining thanks to Battle Plan and I was.<br />
<br />
I move JK Luke into the Cantina away from Fett and get a drain of 3 in there for a turn. He piles a ton of guys on the Barge - Xizor (alien leader), Chokkk (that guy&#146;s a BEAST), Boelo (from reserve courtesy of Power of the Hutt), and Fett (after he got un-Clashed) and parks it at DBay 94, I really cant do beatdown on that, too many guys. Then he drops Mara and 4LOM on Luke in the Cantina and battles; Luke Dodges out to the DBay 94 and gives the Barge-full of aliens the finger. Alex leaves Mara and the droid in the Cantina which proves to be the game-ending mistake.<br />
<br />
I put Han in there next turn, initiate with the tripler card, Run Luke Run into the battle, Clash 4LOM from lost just to be sure, Dont Get Corky to add a coupla BD, Mara gets jacked for game-ending battle damage.<br />
Full Win by mid-high 20s<br />
<br />
<br />
Yay: The beatdown. Meeting and beating a new opponent.<br />
<br />
Boo: No Escape and the &lt;&gt; Dockbay, that wasnt the only time that would be used against me as you will read in game 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I&#146;m the top light player and I get paired against the top dark player<br />
Game 2<br />
my Watto vs. Jim Li (2138)&#146;s anti-Watto<br />
So yeah, he pretty much made a deck to beat mine. He started Throne Room with HFTMF for Battle Plan combo, new grabber, and Insight combo. Sensing the prospect of a first-turn HotJ I start No Escape, IAO combo, and Tint/OE.<br />
<br />
He goes first, activates 4, drops a twix, and draws all 4. I go with my usual first turn flip, Watto at the Yard, Dr E and Ponda B at Mos Espa and make him lose 2.<br />
<br />
He goes and drops EPP Han and Harc Seff in front of Watto, then converts the Junkyard (??) and battles. Shoots Watto and I lose him and a couple more. I go and cant drain cuz of Battle Plan so I pick up a few.<br />
<br />
He goes and Revos Mos Espa and drops Goo Nee Tay. Then pays 1 force for an OOC combo which I grab. He has a 1 in 4 shot of getting Watto but gets a red card. Pays 3 to play another OOC combo and gets my starting interrupt. Watto is safe for now.<br />
But I&#146;m only activating 5 force a turn (had the Holotable down too). I drew my Wipe Them Out All of Them so Dr E and Panda Bear let me activate one on his turn. No drains cuz of BPlan and Harc.<br />
<br />
Jim drops Queer-Gon to Mos Espa and he kills off Dre and Silent Bob. I put Mara Jade down to the Throne Room and she gets off a drain of 3 before EPP Luke clears off with her. Luke is quite the Resilient one and would re-appear with Han and Harc at the Yard next turn. Jim loses the Insight combo to grab I Hope She&#146;s Alright and reinforces Mos Espa with Twat Khaa and drops IHSA. So now I gotta take care of that.<br />
<br />
I lose to it while I save up for a turn (cuz I&#146;m still only activating 5 a turn and Goo is out) and drop EPP Vader against Qui and Twat. Through a miracle of God (and some help from Dark Strike) I draw high enough to hit Qui and break Twat&#146;s immunity and clear the site. IHSA bites it (phew). So now Jim&#146;s only damage to me is his pesky drain of 1 at the Yard.<br />
<br />
He puts down EPP Obi at Mos Espa to try and cause some more damage, and I start saving force to attack him. I have in hand Maul, Phantom Menace, and an extra Watto so I plan to drop Maul and TPM to kill EPP Obi and hopefully survive. But the turn before I do that Jim pays 3 for Recoil in Fear and I gotta get a new hand. =0 I do the shuffle thing and draw my new hand...and it quite possibly is better than before. I lost TPM and the spare Watto, but I got the same Maul back along with EPP Vader and a Force Field. So I put the Vader down against Obi and they square off.<br />
<br />
Here is the highlight of the game. It&#146;s EPP Vader vs. EPP Obi-Wan. I initiate. Swing and hit. He wants to swing but Vader has a Force Field protecting him. Draw battle D. Mine&#146;s decent; his is... Obi&#146;s Hut!! Obi dies with some overflow and Vader STAYS. Yeahhhh buddy.<br />
<br />
And let me just note that about halfway through the game Jim dropped Civil Disorder, and there was no way I was canceling that. It would have eaten me alive if it weren&#146;t for the Holotable. I dropped a Ghhhk down on the Table every turn, sometimes drained, then picked it back up to deploy again to satisfy Civil D. Jim made me burn the Ghhhk one turn (I think he laid some beats on that EPP Vader) but by then I had drawn my Monnok and used that instead.<br />
<br />
Anyway I just tried to deal as much damage as possible ... which wasn&#146;t easy with Jim recycling ICBW&#146;s with naked 3PO ...one turn I was able to flip with Maul at Mos Espa and a spare Watto at the Yard...Jim didnt have two saved so he lost two. I dont really know how I dealt him any damage at all, but he drew a lot and I think put a lot on table. At one point he was under 10 life force and I still had a good 20 or 30...I would have drawn up then if I could but I was not activating anywhere near enough. He On Edged twice (I grabbed it first time) and finished me off with a drain at a Revo&#146;ed Massassi Ruins.<br />
Full Loss by 15<br />
<br />
Yay: Doing pretty well against a deck that was made to beat mine.<br />
<br />
Boo: Having to play such a deck in the first place. Jim bragged on his deck, but it really was a steaming heap. Props to him I guess for a good meta choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
We take a long and totally unnecessary break and resume gaming around 4 pm =/<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
Watto against Jay Adams (1821)&#146;s RTP<br />
I don&#146;t know why people play with RTP. The deck just beats itself. He started Mindful of the Future for Echo Base Garrison; I started IAO combo, Tint/OE, and YCHF for first turn S&amp;D.<br />
<br />
My first turn consists of Watto going to the Yard from reserve and Mara going to Mos Espa and getting her Saber. Deploy S&amp;D and Jay loses 3 before he gets a turn.<br />
He apparently got a decent opening hand with a Ronto and a Lift Tube so 8D8 is in front of the Princess first turn. Lose to S&amp;D.<br />
<br />
I go and drain for 3 and deal 2 Slave and 1 more with S&amp;D. Do a little drawing. It is now the end of my second turn and Jay has lost 10 force.<br />
He goes and tries to rescue Leia but draws low. Loses to S&amp;D and saves 2 force to pay for my objective.<br />
<br />
I drain for 3 again and deploy Broken Concentration and cut off one of his force so he has to lose to Slave again. Put Palpy at Y4 dockbay to drain and wait for Leia with his Lightning. Deploy Bad Feeling Have I. He loses to S&amp;D.<br />
He tries to rescue Leia and draws a site. Broken Con to take away a force. Lose to S&amp;D.<br />
<br />
Between BrokCon and Bad Feeling he never puts a guy down. He also never draws high enough to rescue Leia. My drains and direct damage finsih him off in probably less time than it took you to read this.<br />
Full Win by 34<br />
<br />
Yay: big win<br />
<br />
Boo: showing him up like that; sorry dude. can&#146;t say i didn&#146;t have some help...<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4<br />
my Watch Your Balls against Jim Li&#146;s Brangus.<br />
Everybody&#146;s favorite matchup. His starting effect is Tint/OE, I stick with my usual 3.<br />
<br />
His first turn he pays 2 for Sebulba and I guess the War Room was in his force pile cuz he pulled a DBay and drew.<br />
That&#146;s ok cuz I got a crappy hand too with the &lt;&gt; Dbay lookin me in the face. No Luke, no Han, nothin. Activate 8 or 9 and go searching for the Home One DBay; of course I activated it. So Jim gets a first-turn verification. I do notice that there are 3 Lukes and 1 Saber in reserve which means there are one of each in Force. I draw up to get them, an EPP Han, and the Home One DBay.<br />
<br />
Jim also noticed that there were 3 Lukes and 1 Saber and, thinking those were all the Lukes/Sabers in my deck, put Palpatine in the Cantina next turn. I play A Step Backwards sometime around here and it gets grabbed so it won&#146;t be coming out of lost.<br />
I get 9 force again and drop Jedi Luke in front of Palpy. Saberize him and battle. Once again through an act of God I draw high enough to hit Ol&#146; Wrinkly...my BD is a 5 and his is a 3 so he loses Pruneface and 6. I watch gleefully as his Ghhhk goes off the top so I won&#146;t have to deal with that getting bounced by Brangus. I think IAO/SP went off the top here as well.<br />
<br />
So now I have a nice drain of 3 set up and am looking to flip. I do that with Theron Nett on Red 10 with an X-Wing Cannon at Tatooine and Talon Karrde on the ground. I&#146;ve got a Dodge and a Run Luke Run in hand so Talon is pretty much safe. I play my second ASB and Jim plays a Collision or two and we&#146;re each getting closer to the magic 25. I get Beggar out early and it pays for itself 2 or 3 times over throughout the game.<br />
Luke lasts about a turn in the Cantina before Jim drops EPP Vader and 4LOM on his head...I Dodge away from that (and Ounee Ta to get Dodge back next turn). Vader and the droid would chase Luke back and forth between DBay 94 and the Cantina for a turn or two, but never drain because of BPlan. <br />
<br />
I lose the race on a misplay of Neck and Neck. I played it on his turn, after the control phase, so the &quot;next&quot; control phase is mine and NOBODY draws race destiny then, dammit. Jim&#146;s total is 25, just barely enough to win, and he has the 6 to pay for his retrieval. I lose 4 interrupts and 2 cards I didnt really need. The good thing about that is that he was only activating like 8 a turn so paying for the retrieval pretty much took up his entire turn.<br />
<br />
I finally get the cards I need to fight Vader and 4LOM. They&#146;re in the Cantina with Jedi Luke and I put down EPP Han and Mirax and initiate. Jim had saved only one force and I used it with Beggar so no interrupts for him. He wants to target Luke with 4LOM but that&#146;s Too Close For Comfort. Luke swings and hits Vader, and Vader swings back...but Luke Dodges the cut and survives. I blew it and didnt save enough to shoot 4LOM or to draw 3 BD ... I only draw 2 but they&#146;re decent and I get Jim for Vader, 4LOM and 8 or 9 I believe. All I lose is Mirax. I move Han out to DBay 94 and I have the Dodge in lost pile and RLR! in hand so he should be safe.<br />
<br />
So it looks like this: Theron Nett is holdin down the system with an XWing Cannon...Wedge would go up to join him halfway through the game. I&#146;ll Take The Leader is out. Luke is in the Cantina draining for a steady 3 a turn. Han is at DBay 94 draining for 2. The Arena comes next and pretty much no action took place there all game. The Spaceport Dockbay is on the end and I put Melas there to drain for 2 but EPP Vader comes down for 3 force and clears out with him. Jim has Lat Damaged Red 10 and he has a recurring Counter Assault so I don&#146;t drain at the system (and sometimes not with Han either). But Luke&#146;s drain of 3 is causing some problems for Jim.<br />
<br />
He puts down Palpy, Maul, and Janus for like negative-24 at the &lt;&gt; DBay and transits Maul over in front of Han at DBay 94. Then he finds his Control and uses that recurringly to cancel Luke&#146;s drain in the Cantina. His IAO/SPlans and his second grabber are buried in lost pile so I On Edge like a fiend and get a bunch of force back. Without Mirax I had a hard time finding a decent destiny at first, but then I found a spare X-Wing Cannon and retrieved two destiny-6 cards in a row so that was all good. I eventually am able to bury his Control and he moves Maul in front of Luke to block the drain for a turn but he dies real quick-like. Wrinkles and Janus sit at the &lt;&gt; DBay but only drain once or twice thanks to BPlan. I of course am draining for free and eventually drain him out...<br />
Full Win by 19<br />
<br />
Yay: FOUR Lukes, TWO Sabers. No Secret Plans or grabber on my Edges<br />
<br />
Boo: No Escape and the &lt;&gt; DBay again, and the Neck and Neck thing.<br />
<br />
There are no undefeateds...Jim, Drew, and I are all 3-1 and my diff is the biggest so I come away the victor. To the victor goes ... nothing, however, as Jay apparently left the tourney foils at home =0 He promises to mail me one though so it&#146;s all good. I&#146;ll just be happy with the ratings boost I&#146;ll get when this tourney updates.<br />
Jim came in second and Drew in third; they had played first game and Drew had lost.<br />
